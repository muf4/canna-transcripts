Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0 where we explore the history of a clandestine scene.
Researching everything from cannabis strain history, old smuggling tales from
the first-person perspective, to breeding science and news on current subculture.
I'm your host Matthew and I'll occasionally be joined by my homie NotSoDog,
breeder and grower from Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and sometimes
interview other participants. Our goal is to document this history before it's
written by corporations and others who just weren't there. Let's start righting
some wrongs. Welcome to the underground.
All right, one of the first things I think since we have you here,
Shawnee, like you know, one of the things that we're often talking about like
we're in discord and stuff is hype strains, people admiration, different
things people experience as like as they're just getting back into buying
seeds and getting into the scene or in your case getting back into it from you
know being into it real heavy at one point. And one of the biggest things that
people come to you with is why you hate root beer so much? What's your problem
with gene? What what is this root beer hate you have? And you know I've always
seen it from your angle but I would like you to explain it from your angle for
everyone to hear because when I hear it I don't hear what they're hearing.
Yeah well I don't hear what they're hearing. I could kind of imagine what they're
hearing but I don't know what they're hearing either. But it's something kind of
went like viral in our server and it just kind of blew up and I think because
there was a lot of arguments around it as well. Yeah. But like so yeah so like I
entered the computer world with IG and all this stuff and like you don't
know when you don't know people you don't know all these like brands and you
don't know all this stuff you really don't have any idea what you're looking
at. But like I started to like well hanging out with you guys it's like
question what I'm buying trying to understand on a deeper level all this
sort of stuff. So like when there's certain things that are like super super
big and I'm like why are they big? Why why is this like why does everybody want
this? But when I ask those questions to other people it's like I don't get an
answer either. Yeah. And root beer was like the one I don't know why that was
the one that stuck but like everybody wanted root beer but I don't I didn't
really understand why and I don't think anybody else really did either. I mean I
think it was because like it was just how you asked but why root beer? And I
think someone took that as an offense like it was so offensive that you would
even ask why what do you mean why? There's 30 of us talking about how much
we want it. What do you mean why? Yeah and Gene's cool and all this stuff and like
everything verified and it's like you know what's the problem? But I mean it's
nobody had really experienced it like very few people ever experienced it and
nobody really has any idea it isn't really proven on any level that we know
but it just kind of like blew up because of the memes right? And all the joking
and I like there was that podcast episode where Gene was talking about it
and he seemed really open about it and he that he didn't want to release it
because he didn't think it would live up to the expectation that had already
built up. Sure. And that you know he mentioned like herm issues if people
were running it indoor and all kinds of stuff and people still wanted it like
crazy you know it's like I don't think people even listen to him in that
section because what I heard was you know maybe it's not as good as everyone
thinks right? Yeah sure I think he was just being realistic yeah I give people
realistic expectations and that's fair I mean like I like I've tried to tell
people when they were arguing with you it's and I don't think it is even
necessarily about root beer and it certainly isn't about just Gene you know
like don't even have a problem Gene he's a nice dude but it's more about the idea
of why why is there hype behind this and and why are we feeling like sheep
what's it what's the cult the phenomenon of it right because it just like it's
this hive mind mentality where you know certain things get mentioned enough that
everyone's like damn I want to try that you know but like what I want more
people to be doing is to like understand what they like what they what they want
and if it's something that they want you know like I I haven't run any of
Gene stuff but mainly because he from my understanding he breeds outdoors in a
region that is far from me and I grow indoors and it doesn't it doesn't make
sense for me to run his seed sure I like I don't know I kind of like there's
other things I would rather do not not because of anything against him or
anything like that but like I've sort of ruled certain certain things out due
to things like I just mentioned right like it's outdoor seed yeah I mean I
think that's something I wish I not even just you or and again not even in
relation to Gene anyone should be taking that into what they're doing like okay
I'm growing indoor I need to have seeds that were bred indoor are these breeders
breeding my seeds indoor because if they're breeding them outdoor and you're
trying to bring them indoor a lot of stuff that does really well outdoor will
have intersex traits indoor it's common it's very common so that's something
people should be asking but I don't think anybody even asked that like I
don't you think that was that's not even a part of the equation when people think
about buying seeds like oh it's a pretty well it often isn't and like that like
from my experience like the average person they're really looking at all the
wrong things usually you know they're looking at like a name that sticks out
that either they have attachment to or whatever the reason or a certain like
turt profile that it's supposed to be promising you or you know like very
surface level things yeah and I find it interesting actually to like in our
server watching a lot of people pop some things that you know are probably gonna
be like a high potency and then they're like whoa this is a little much you know
like maybe they got hit with that for the first time and they're just like
yeah it's it's definitely potent but it might not be what I want to smoke every
day exactly yeah so like I think that's really great growth for for people and
that like I love that's what I love about popping seed and trying new things
is like you know it's all about what you like and experiencing that and then
trying to search for the things that you know do it for you yeah that's perfect
welcome back guys what's up pack and we also have local botanist here with us so
we kind of just joy jumped into the conversation and we're recording it a
little late on Friday and we're just gonna have a small roundtable talk about
some different things and of course we were gonna talk a little bit and in that
kind of leads into a little bit of what I was gonna get into about like putting
people on pedestals like yeah I think that is a another factor I mean we see
it and it happens here you know like just being totally transparent I see it
happen here with me with not so we try to keep it as as real as possible and
remind people we're just fucking like low-rent farmers like I grow a few types
of plants but I'm I'm not even capable of being called a real farmer let alone
needing a pedestal you know and other people don't necessarily deserve that
either but in the world of marketing and hype you know dudes flashing Rolexes or
fake Rolexes but it doesn't matter if it flicks by real fast you know pedestals
happen a lot and and one thing I've noticed is what happens when people have
their their paradigm shifted on a breeder like let's say that this is their
hero breeder and they find out something very devastating it almost it almost
breaks people sometimes you guys have seen it like people flip the fuck out
sometimes yeah they do yeah it's kind of it's really weird with like grown adult
men you know yeah that they're so passionate to that level it's like I'm
not a sports fan but I also get that vibe when people are like super into
like sports dudes yeah yeah it's like you're a grown-up you know yeah it's a
trip yeah it's a trip the the attachment people get to other grown men like that
yeah and admiration that they hold and I get I get it like cuz I had that like
it's it's not like something I don't understand and when I got into scene
like I I remember looking up to Adam Dunn like he was one of the Americans
that went over there to Amsterdam you know and like Don and Aaron were over
there too but they were kind of like Hollywood knobs so I didn't I didn't
like have any kind of anything vibe with them you know but Adam seemed to be
smart like he would talk about his strains and sourcing these these old
California and and American quinoline strains so I was real into him and then
over time when you get to meet people and have relationships with them and
they become much more human you realize how much you did have them on a
pedestal at a time when people yeah and very often you're disappointed and
sometimes you're not sometimes people are as special as you kind of always
hope they would be but that's why that's a rare occurrence local when you first
got into seeds what were some of the dudes that you were hearing about that
maybe maybe got you excited at first and later you you found like maybe yeah
maybe I'm not so into it yeah so seats were really weird for me you know like I
bought like from Nirvana here and there like Dutch passion was another one but
like this was already like you know like I don't know 2015 2016 so it's like by
then it's like nobody was really looking into that yeah and then I had a friend
who was generous enough just to give me like a bunch of different seeds you know
I think one of them was like something called blackberry cheesecake like a
heavy-duty fruity cross you know things like that I grew them and you know for
the time for me I thought they were good because like they smelled different like
it wasn't just like a cheap-ass bag sure you buy on the street you know yeah and
then you know after that I I kind of just started like thinking about you
know like how do people claim that they are making these crosses that you know
like for example like blue dream you have 20 different fucking blue dreams
yeah and like you know a little bit about me like my background is in like
genetics and botany and all that and you know more so population genetics and it's
you're going to college for this your university yeah I went yeah I got my
degree two years ago in that and so you know like instinctually I kind of just
thought okay like these people say they have like you know this blue dream or
whatever it's like you know what's to say that they're all gonna be the same
you know you have different pollen donors you have different like pollen
receivers and all that so it's like who's to say what's what and I think
that's kind of like what struck like the whole like provenance type of like you
know understanding it like knowing that like not anyone is just gonna give you
what they say it is you know because it the sad truth of it is is like it's a
it's a sketchy scene you know there are sketchy people but yeah and you know as
a little time went on like I began to get a little interested in history and
that's kind of like when I stumbled upon this podcast yeah I listened to the
first episode and like I believe you gave crybaby a shout out yeah that's
right yeah like just a little after that I joined Breeder Syndicate and like
yeah I mean it kind of went from there so I mean luckily I was like adopted
into like a good community relatively early on so like I didn't have to go
through like any bullshit or anything or like get my fucking hopes and dreams
crushed like some of these other people do and I don't know at the end of it
like I mean you see these dogs they're almost in a daze when they hear about
like heroes being tweakers snitches and stuff yeah and yeah crazy thing is it's
like it's you know we're all humans and it's like I feel like we should all be
true to ourselves and it's like you know by claiming all these things you're
like lying to yourself and and what good is that you know a lot of delusion yeah
exactly and it's kind of sad I guess but what's cool about the server here is
like like I remember when I was early on in there but like everybody has bought
shit you know everybody's been taken and like it's not like there's people in
there that are very experienced that are like never had that happen everyone's
had that hell yeah no and that's where it's like some people take it super
personally some people are super invested financially and emotionally but
I mean when the when open conversations happen and it's like look like this is
kind of what we know and it's not the greatest thing to hear like I mean it's
I don't understand when people just don't want to hear it they don't want to
accept it or they're they start fights over it or you know I I was not like
that I'm just like holy shit really tell me more you know yeah I don't like being
wrong to help me be right like that get me there well understanding is the most
important part right it's not about who's good and who's bad and who's this
and who you know it's just understanding situations and like you said humanizing
people like like nobody's perfect you know there isn't a person in the world
that's perfect there isn't a person in the world that hasn't done a stupid
thing or misstep or whatever but like people that are actively like learning
and trying to move forward it's like they're moving forward you know yeah
always yeah you know one of the biggest problems that I found since local you're
like a university type dude was like I'm still having trouble communicating
with university people on the level of like their geneticists their botanists
they understand breeding it in these deep levels but trying to communicate to
them the history of cannabis how we came to the conclusions that we have why
we're there and why it matters to what they're doing and why they need to know
this stuff before they start like doing these tests on these strains and
comparing this strain to this strain and why they need to know all this stuff
like how do we how do you tell people that are obviously much more educated
and smart you know in their own mind than we are how do you how do you
explain that to them what would you do from your it's kind of a question but I
mean yeah it is a complex question I mean you know I after all like I just
got my undergrad like I'm now a PhD or like my I don't like any means but like
there's definitely intentions for that yeah but like I don't know I think it's
really hard for them to kind of accept us somewhat and maybe it's because you
know we're just a bunch of dudes that like smoke weed and nerd out about you
know shit that doesn't really matter to the world even though it does yeah and
that's like one thing I kind of joked about like with people like when they
ask like oh hey what do you do as a botanist and I was like oh yeah like I
study this you know it you know it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of
things but to me it's really interesting so yeah I'm gonna say fuck it and do it
you know but I think like one way to maybe get like attention of some
scientists is maybe trying to like integrate some of like maybe the
hypotheses that like we have maybe about certain families of plants you know or
groups of plants you know like how can we integrate this into like how they're
studying like what they're studying so like for example the professor that I
was studying under at my school she was interested in plant breeding systems so
like you know how like weed is is a fucking dioecious right yeah you have
your male and your female plants well you know she was studying plants that
were gyno dioecious which are female and like you know hermaphroditic plants
yeah true males so it's like you know I think there are ways to kind of
integrate like studies between like the two topics so it's like I think it's
more about relating it to their topic of study then you know trying to achieve
this goal you know maybe just sequencing DNA or whatever to see it's just related
to me like it's like I look at them and what they're doing and I'm like how can
you even waste your time sequencing the DNA of this blue dream cut that you went
and sourced from a collective you say 95% of the cuts are similar to this one
when it's probably not even fucking blue dream why are you wasting your time
because that's not even having anything to do that everybody in history is
talking about and that you're gonna be comparing this data to you know yeah
that I can't explain it to them we have to also consider that we need to have
information on what the parents actually were it's not like you can just
take what what was it like a fucking super silver haze and a blueberry like
you can't yeah sequences to separately and expect it exactly to be related to
the blue dream that they sequence so it's obviously there they don't even
understand that part like they don't know for sure and it seems to me it's so
scientifically obvious like if you're gonna start at a place you're gonna
fucking crawl back up to the parent line maybe should figure this shit up out
along the way but like their their ideas were like basically we don't think or
what the most common sentiment I'm getting from them I shouldn't say all of
them the most common sentiment I've gotten from multiple people in that
field is how do you know you're right
so that's that's I guess the beauty of science you know like yeah and that's
where I've been trying to work on like interpreting like or not interpreting
using the Bayes theorem to bring in to actually working that into how we
approach history and how we prove past historical events within reason and in
within science and I think like that's something that I've been looking at as
it's used in other like in ancient religions and stuff to prove what
happened in ancient religions even though all we have is texts you know
yeah and that's really the key honestly like you know people who witness
certain events you know like primary sources and all that you know like
primary sources are I mean sometimes gonna be some of the most valuable
sources but you know obviously those may be biased depending on for sure you know
as you seen dude like we've seen firsthand like the best primary sources
and then it gets kind of screwy yeah no yeah yeah yeah but yeah like I mean I
feel I feel awesome knowing that there's actually like this theorem that people
figured out that helps prove history when it's based on written evidence in
the past it's pretty cool reference it was dr. Richard Carrier in one second
want to make sure I give him credit for this because it is a pretty it was
proving history and on the his proving history yeah I think that's what it is
Richard Carrier proving history yeah and the science world is like the type
of world that like if it's not on paper it's you know probably not gonna be real
so you know that's another thing to take into consideration you know when my mind
can you why do these tests if none of that matters why even do the tests like
it's you know it at that point it's fucking with ethics and it's like if
this is really something that they wanted it to per se integrate into like
pharmaceuticals and stuff it's like you're also fucking with that yeah yeah
yeah if you want to make it medicine then you need the data that people use
but you need to go access that data that people had you need to know what they
were smoking at the time not what you think yeah and that but it just I don't
know it's been a long long drawn-out process trying to have these
conversations with these university professors and PhDs and and it's still
gotten to me I feel like it's gotten not very far yeah and you'd hope things
would get better with federal legalization but I just feel like it's
still gonna be rather tricky to conduct any kind of like ecological based
studies like I feel like it's gonna take I feel like it's gonna take someone as
that just happens to get into the head of one of these programs to end up being
a massive C nerd that's what it like it's that's someone was a massive C nerd
and actually gain interest in history and really dive in and that's like a
dice roll because look at how few of us there are in cannabis let alone a tiny
community it really is yeah what's your thoughts on it pack oh you caught me off
guard here we're just talking about the the trying to talk to the university
people about why why they need to take the history of strains seriously before
they start trying to fuck with sequencing and doing all that sure
chasing it I just have a real hard time communicating with them on it I didn't
know if you know I'm not sure if it's lost in translation possibly you know
not having the same kind of reference point to be able to speak their language
yeah maybe it's something along those lines but I would imagine anybody who's
truly you know stepping up to the plate from a scientific practitioner level
they're gonna want to consider you know all variables right and you know just
the fact that has been taboo to research you know I wonder you know people have
kind of become my optic or sort of conditioned into their own as much as
scientists are open they're also you know looking along their own agenda for
things and so how you how you kind of introduce another lens to look there is
a good question some of these people even smoke which is like okay so you
know you've been smoking forever what I don't know I don't know is this one of
those stone they're not smoking the right shit it's a problem exactly so one
of the things I also wanted to get into was one of the number one questions we
get asked and we have you know we have me and pack on here and we have Shawnee
and local was males people have questions about males all the time
Shawnee load up some male questions like that you think people would want
to know about local you load them up well like like number one right like the
like if you're looking for a male and you'd like to use a male the only way
you know is if you grow the offspring and observe the females correct correct
yeah so I mean like this I read this article and like me and crybaby had a
little conversation about it but like what the first question that popped into
my head was like how many how many elite males exist today like how many people
are holding males that they breed with that they've been like held on to for a
significant amount of time yeah and the answer was pretty low right yeah very
very low very low I don't think that there's a lot of revisiting with certain
males I think people when they do it they tend to select another male from
the seed line it's very hard to do I know when we were keeping males alive
over the years before the moon situation it would it's just constant repotting
making sure the pots big enough making sure your male isn't flowering my
bedroom is constantly 24 7 like just 24 on there's never any kind of darkness in
my bedroom because of males constantly trying to keep males around second they
hit the bottom of the pot they'd always start flowering in there and if it's in
the same location as a female room that could be a serious problem like you're
trying to get meals alive while also making seeds of something else with
another male that's not really that good it's not it's not beneficial so you
know you always have to learn on the fly over time when it comes to stuff like
really isolating still not advised to keep them in the same room but yeah it's
why you don't see it very often there's like the Hayes Hayes a a C male that
were real famous we kept the blue bonnet one alive for a long time and it was
over at Radio Ridge until we got HPLV now it's no longer with us
bummer but we tried we tried to keep it alive to pass out for other people to do
blueberry work that was the intent yeah it's not that common and I think the
first question I get the most is what do you look for when selecting a male
the number one well like like great they're pretty much all myths though
right or not myths but like they're not all like 100% confirmed sort of I mean
it just like if you okay like back in the day I remember when I started I was
told by by by the hot breath guy if you want to find a male you want to look for
the one that looks most like the female and grows most like a female and the one
you think is least like a male in the end like it looks like a female and at
the very last minute you guys oh it's a male and that's the one so for a long
time I just did that you know and then as I started going I was really I'm not
really getting anything anywhere by doing that like it's not doing anything
special for me like I I didn't know if I was trying to just make sure there was
no herms at the beginning is that what I'm trying to do because that seems to
be what people complain about the most you just don't want herms you know yeah
and as you're doing this stuff you're seeing different traits pop out right
and then you see certain things from from the male and certain leaf shapes
certain certain serrations like oh wait the trade I can identify you know and
slowly you kind of realize there's not just one male one trait one one it's
like trying to constantly fit a square peg in a circle you know like if you if
you're looking for the same trait in every male you're trying to fit a square
in a circle like if when it came to the blue bonnet stuff it was like I wanted
blueberry versions of everything if I want that I'm not gonna go to a to I
don't know Apple mints or whatever and and try to make that male work you know
and just until it works it is not how it works so um yeah I mean when you're
selecting for a male you've got to start somewhere sometimes it's as easy as one
two three roll a dice pick one if you don't know anything about the line it's
a lot easier to know a line grow the line out know the females and that way
when you start seeing these males pop out you can see their counterparts in
the female slowly but surely with what traits line up with both of them and
that's the best advice know your line before you work it know your line before
you know your line before you choose a male and it'll tell you everything you
don't have to have any questions I think I think your intentions you know say a
lot to you I mean if you're somebody who's really trying to go deep and you
know you got the means space wise time wise and what have you to go that way
then sure you know but if let's say you just grab bag of seeds right and you pop
it you got a couple males and you know you're not a lifer necessarily but you
want to mess around or even like open pollination situations right sure you
can open pollinate with more than one male you don't have to have 12 males in
there if you have a 4x4 there's like all kinds of consideration in terms of
what you're trying to get into as well yeah it's what you're trying to achieve
are you trying to make seeds for sale are you trying to make it just to learn
the line I mean there's all kinds of different reasons and appropriate uses
of things like that sure yeah you may not have an opportunity to go through
five males and grow out all their prodigy continue to select and figure out
how to you know dial it in the way you want so that makes a lot of sense mm-hmm
what about you local you have any questions on males yeah I guess yeah the
question is like how is one may be able to distinguish when to let's say pull a
male from it you know the original f1 versus maybe pulling a male for
breeding later down in the generation like are there instances like where
people actually like you know move a line forward to select a male or like I
think it's really odd when I can't think of a situation unless I was like doing
like parallel breeding where I'm working to two different expressions from the
same line then I would choose a male at like f5 to cross to a male like f5 up
here that's it that's a good case for doing something like that like going
down to the mill up here as opposed to down here mm-hmm I can't really think of
any situation where I would purposely choose like an f3 male over an f1 male
for any situation I'm sure there are occasions where that comes up I can't
think of one yeah I mean yeah I guess maybe the only instance I could think of
is maybe pulling like a male from an app to you because it is your you know
largest window for selection you know and maybe you just bring diverse more
diversity yeah maybe yeah but but yeah I don't know usually yeah the thing is
usually if I'm working something in my mind if I'm working something forward
I'm only going forward for uniformity of a trait never for diversity but I'm sure
like if someone had like ten seeds of a line that might actually be a decent
thing to do you know and with me when it comes to open pollinations like I'm
all or nothing with open pollinations it's like yeah I have to leave all the
males in there with all the females or one male one female or or one male all
females and that's only because like I feel like if you're doing any kind of
pulling out based on like oh this thing's herming that let's all remove
that one I'm artificially selecting just one little thing away from that pool
it's only one little thing but I'm taking away a trait you know I think
it's not a great trait but I'm taking away but it might be a link trait to
something very special in that line and you might have just pulled it so so
that's the only time I would say like it's more beneficial to have all the
males versus just choosing a few but if it's a space consideration like Pat was
talking about that's an excellent time when it's like you know like you're not
probably not even making seeds to sell at that point but you're trying to go
through the line that's a perfect time to you know use what works for you you
know whatever's gonna help you get through that line more to understand it
more perfect case for it I mean you know most people nowadays dude are in it for
themselves right yeah and this idea of like it being you know a lifestyle
versus like a window of opportunity you have to jump through you know I'm saying
I kind of separates the men from the boys I guess like the ones yeah it
always has like when somebody gets the opportunity to fuck so fuck you over to
try and make the situation better it happened all the time like yeah well
yeah yeah yeah what's the difference between the long timers and the short
turn timers in cannabis you know like being in being in the seed scene for
over 15 years now I've watched a revolving door of characters some of
them the most popular dudes you couldn't imagine the biggest top of the scene
totally gone no one even remembers him anymore you know well it flashes in the
pan like that happened all the time there's a high turnover rate in cannabis
and very few are people that have been in it longer than 10 years in the seed
