Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate, where we explore the history of a clan-destined
scene through the eyes of the folks who lived it. I'm Matthew, owner of Riot
Seeds. I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host NotSoDog, breeder and grower
from Mendocino. Welcome to the underground.
Hopefully more people show up so we can actually give a nice treatise on the
past, present, future maybe. I don't know if we can talk about the future of
clone trading, clone collecting. I've talked about it a little bit recently,
about a little bit of where people are that have a lot of these strains
archived that are rare and old and special, but I don't think I've really
given a full long tale of how it kind of how it developed over time, how it was
when we were breaking into the scene, like how one would even go about
collecting clones in the first place, because obviously you know a lot of it's
trading and not everybody has something to trade at the beginning. We'll talk
about clone circles. Yeah, I gotta give myself the own crowd cheer. But until we
start that, anybody have any questions yet? Anything you want me to touch on so
I don't forget? Anything? Clown hoarding. I can talk about clown hoarding. There's
plenty of clowns hoarding in the seed industry. Oh my god, did I? There it is.
Yeah, clown whoring. I could do that too. Clown whoring. Those bastards. Clowns are
always whoring around. Clone people. Well, this is about clone people. I mean, really?
But going to the theory of it should... I'm a Ben Sherman fool. You know how I
roll clay. Yeah, I mean, it's all the same theory, right? Like you can you can take a
theory and apply it to fools. It's very easy to do. So hopefully you guys can use
some critical thinking and apply it so I don't have to go and go and go over
every single dipshit that's pretending to be in circles. You know, it's a lot
easier just to explain it. Before you know it, it is on a reveg. Oh, I'm not doing
cloning tips and tricks, but I mean just for that quick one. Sometimes it's better
to take it on a reveg. Sometimes it's better to take it beforehand. Sometimes
things root easier after a reveg. So yeah. This is George. George from Walmart.
Okay. I think at 80 we can be close enough to start this bullshit. All right.
So back in the day, clones weren't really a big thing. A lot of a lot of a lot of
people were using seeds. When I say back in the day, I'm talking, you know, 70s, 60s,
on through the 80s, up until the 90s. Clones weren't the the primary source
for people to be passing genetics. Most of it was done in seed form. That's how a
lot of this started. On in through when you get up into maybe like the Northern
Lights era would be a good example of how of how people started getting in
these circles that had certain genetics and were keeping them very tight and
only passing it to people in their circles and trusted people. And that all
kind of started because, you know, there were different people in each market and
giving someone a special clone that was considered elite at the time. And the
definition of elite back then is a lot different than now. That is definitely
morphed. But you didn't want to give someone in the same area as you the same
exact clone if it was super special because they'd be knocking into your
market and and you guys would end up competing with each other. So you
basically set yourself up to be competed against. So a lot of times when clones
were shared they were they were shared in different markets. But there were also
clone crews that are pushing out tons of weight and all pushing each other to
brand a particular line. Kind of like the Northern Lights stuff. As you got
into online when Overgrow was popping up and all that you had a lot of people
that had amassed these small little collections of clones during that time.
Some bigger than others. But a lot of them would amass these small clone
collections. And provenance wasn't as much as a serious thing back then. Hey I
see you saying clone hoarding over and over. I'll get to it dude. I'll get to it
for you. But you'd see these people amass these small collections and as they
would speak they would learn to trust who was gonna keep their word on not
passing said clones and making it back into their market. And some people would
just take the clones and run and do their own thing. Rename it. Pretend like
it's a new thing. And that's how we get to today. So as I entered I wasn't I
didn't have special stuff but I was in California. And unfortunately there were
a few places. What's the best one I found was PNC. It was a dude named Ape. And I
would say at least 80% plus of his of his things were legit sourced. He was a
stray nerd like a lot of us are still today. And he did some pretty good
sourcing of a lot of OG cuts. Pure Kush's. Purples back then. He did a really good
job sourcing. I was just fortunate to be in that area. I also had a clone crew
that we were a part of with the Hogs Breath crew. And in that circle people
were allowed to have the cut. We weren't allowed to compete. We weren't allowed to
share. And that was that was super important. We weren't allowed to share it
with people outside the group. And that's how you ended up with people like you
know the P91 crew. The Hogs Breath crew. The Bull Rider crew. You ended up with
all these different crews with their one specific cut. And this is kind of
before the OG Kush craze when all that was going on. Once OG Kush hit it was it
was a lot of fronting. A lot of pretending. A lot of fake sourcing. And it
got really bad. And as the online market, the online forums kind of blew up. It
started to get more and more permeated. And a lot harder to verify sources. Now
most of the people that take this seriously take provenance seriously in
the first place. And when I say provenance I don't mean anything more
than like like the term applies to art. If you if you have a painting that you
have and it's signed by someone. If you can't prove where you got it from back
to the artist you've lost the provenance and therefore it loses value. Right? So
with clones it's very much the same thing. You can say I got this clone from
XYZ but nobody knows how XYZ got that clone. At that point it's broken and
people who are super serious about it don't really want to trade with you and
they don't want to get in on it. You know? So now we go to today. The trust in the
market is is all but gone. People today tend to have popped up in the last few
years that are big in the clones trading scene that I'm noticing. That keep having
the same mistakes. And it's because they're trading with people that are new
to the scene too. But have them convinced that they are legit and connected to
this guy or this guy or this guy or this guy. When it comes to me and my friends
we all know who we've given clones to and who those people have given clones
to. For the most part. There's always gonna be exceptions to the rule. But for
the most part we know who has what clone of old shit. Who has given it. Who had
permission to get it. Who didn't. All of the above. And this still exists. This is
still a fucking thing. And people around selling clones online aren't a part of
that's those circles. They're not. They never they never were. Any of those
people selling clones online like that with their big-ass list like I got all
these fucking clones. Fucking source from the breeder cut. These guys are not
people that would ever be trusted with clones in the first place from any of
our circles. Not my circle. Not the other circles that are old that I'm not even a
part of. No one's gonna trust these dudes with shit. And that's where I'm
seeing a lot of the problems arise. Check out your OnlyFans. Rado Rich does have a
great OnlyFans. He's got this great picture of his testicle. Amazing. Do you
know any verified cuts that look distinctly different than in his
pictures? So we get to the next topic. Verifying cuts through pictures. There
are a million reasons why this can't and shouldn't be done and why you don't see
guys like me and Inspecta and everyone trying to verify clones through pictures.
Expressions and micro like in micro climates and expressions things can look
totally different. Totally fucking different. However there are a few cuts
that have certain traits that we know always occur. No matter what the what the
what the expression is. There are certain traits that always pop out of certain
clones. The point being you guys the best advice I could ever give anyone is
if you want to buy spend money on a clone from someone chase that shit all
the way back to the breeder. They should be able to do that. If they can't do that
then there's an issue. Don't just take their word for it because I've seen
people saying some wild fucking shit that they're getting past chem 91
directly from a certain source that didn't happen couldn't happen and
doesn't happen. And it's it's sometimes it's hard to get those answers but if
you can't get the answer then it's not worth getting because every time I'm
seeing people get screwed. Every time they go buy clones from these doofuses
they get screwed. So if they cannot trace the provenance back to the original
breeder there's a problem and you probably I mean you can always take the
risk and try but here's the thing if you're taking a risk and trying but
you've never had the original clone how are you ever gonna fucking verify it and
and people with the chem 91 cut wouldn't be selling it. Not like that. That's not
how that works. So yeah Archive Portland's a great place to get clones
archives as big a nerd as anyone when it comes to provenance he doesn't fuck
around so if you're getting stuff from Archive Portland that's a great source
but yeah I mean most of these kids are just trading clones just trading with
people who have no access to anything and shouldn't have access to anything
and then some of these dudes are cool and like they don't understand this is
going on and they repeat it and they repeat the story and now someone else
has that story and they say but this guy's trustworthy but yeah who was the
guy that you got it from was that dude trustworthy probably not you know that
is that is the best advice I could ever give you chase that shit up the chain do
not see places like Harborside they have people that they randomly get so
back in the day at least I don't know I don't want to speak to now but back in
the day they would have random people bring in clays or trays of clones or
they'd have their in-house cloner but often they'd have people bring in trays
of clones you're trusting some random ass that a bud tender trusted to bring
in clones and vet them why why have you guys ever talked to bud tenders you know
they know less than probably you do even if you're a new person but tenders don't
get into provenance sourcing any of that stuff if you want to source
something do it right take the time meet people be friendly be
trustworthy don't be a snake and you'd be surprised how quickly things open up
I've told that to people from day one and everybody wants to work it around
the around the back end I can't comment on finest because I don't I I don't know
who they source stuff from etc but they've been very nice and they've done
great tissue culture work but as far as like yeah I know yeah let's see pre 90
pre 79 $500 a pop that bubble that pre 79 bubba but yeah I mean if you don't care
then you're adding to the problem
frankly that's that's really what it what it comes down to if you don't care
and you're passing these stories on without doing the work then you're
adding to the problem and that that's where I have a problem and that's why
you see all this confusion in the market people throwing up pictures a chem 91
that don't look like chem 91 you know maybe it's just a really weird grow
maybe they over blew it but I see people commenting in these in these fucking
threads for example let me see if I can find it real quick let me see a good
example of someone oh you can't really see it commenting in a thread that has
no fucking clue what they're talking about this to currents guy he's new he's
probably newer than most of you but he's telling acting like he has a way that he
can oh that might be a fucking hybrid I don't know motherfucker where did you
source your chem 91 to be making these judgments and claims oh you didn't oh
you didn't oh did you say you sourced it from one of my best friends you're
lying so it's how it goes it how it goes you know but then other people don't
know they see this dude speaking in there they don't know that he's a noob
they don't know any of that shit and they're like oh well if he says it might
be real then it might that's how it goes this is how the shit just spins on and
on and on and on how people set them out up so themselves up to be a verifier of
cuts when they have no place verifying anything and you like I said you'll be a
hard press to find someone that will verify or shoot something down I could
give you actually with with chem 91 I could give you a few pointers and I know
I've mentioned a few before but a few pointers leaf cannibalization that's
nutrient burn that's not the leaves cannibalizing themselves the one trade
it does seem to have is the never-ending white pistols but it looks
like someone just newt burn the shit out of s1 or hybrid of chem 91 but in
certain micro climates maybe maybe it's hard to say but I would feel much more
confident not even commenting on this thing because there's no way there's no
way to know for sure unless it's got a lot of the traits and it's missing one
so what can you do anyway yeah I just wanted to give a quick example you know
someone was claiming to have a cut of archives moonbow cancel I didn't want to
do that someone's claiming to have a cut of archives moonbow well archive called
him out on it and then the guys like oh no no no no no I mean I had the breeder
cut of something else rainbow belts or something it's another one that archives
not gonna pass cuts out his breeder cuts out of so be careful be careful he trust
run these fucks down see what they know about about sourcing cuts see who they're
dialed into circle wise ask them then go ask some dudes in the circle likely
people will be honest with you and tell you if they're in their circle or not
it's very easy to do very fucking easy to do anyway that's that's about what I
wanted to run down on that I think I think that it used to be more common
knowledge how you did it you make friends you get into circles you don't
get shit immediately because everybody's been ripped off to shit you know some
people get mad that they can't just get that clone immediately because it's not
fair you know it's not fair it's because fucking scammers rip everyone off and
it's been been that way since day one been that way since day one so people
people that do have cuts are not like super open to just some random new guy
who says hey I'm cool give it to me I promise like that's been done for years
and years and years and years and been heard for years and years and years and
it's a major trigger for a lot of people people in these circles love to share
their clones do I look way more serious people in those in those circles love to
share their clones because they love sharing dank with people they don't
necessarily like to openly share clones with random people to bastardize the
clone another good example of this have been when everyone was trying to chase
joint breath for chems you know I could I could go way further into that but I'm
not going to for the sake of my buddy Matt elite not gonna I'm not gonna talk
about old pee blood but needless to say blind leading the blind in that
situation and people were still paying joint breath for clones because they've
really had that hope it's that fear of missing out logical fallacy and it's
also the appeal to authority logical fallacy both of those are there the
authority being oh well this guy's a breeder he says he's a breeder and and
Pete bud says he's legit well that must mean these are legit well how much do
you know about how much experience people had with the actual clones have
you ever heard the story about him bringing chem for as chem D to a cup and
entering it exactly so yeah I shouldn't probably gone that far and but there's
a point to it you can't just trust everyone just because someone's name is
even linked to the clone it's not necessarily a good reason to necessarily
take their word on on clone provenance so yeah anybody got any questions about
that the dog bud mail exactly and people put his name behind a dog bud mail does
that make any sense fuck no and everybody else around him was telling
don't do that that dude's a liar that's gonna be a problem and come back to the
hunt you but sometimes money is just too much of a yank I mean I really really
liked to be bud I did but I mean you know he was backing someone who said
they were gonna murder me and someone who would say the n-word over and over
and over you know I can't deal with that I can't handle that hopefully he's
figured life out a little better and who to run with and who not to run with
I gotta go be going to church just cuz I'm wearing a long sleeve hmm
sg said he got a mail knows that and he's also said he didn't so you know
that comes back to it I have a question where is it the start of the line to get
my money back you know I'm as many don't care about history or the provenance
that make loot exactly and in a lot of people in here are in here because they
do care about that and that's a point we want to get everybody educated on the
same page that oh no this is a key lime LaCroix yeah these are the bomb it's
pretty much what I always drink I haven't tried a fire sample of apple
fritter yeah I'm not a apple fritter guy I've never really run that stuff so I
can't comment on apple fritter lumpy's giving me some good cuts so before and
they were legit so there is that lumpy was a good source for the cookies and
cherry pie early on I brought as usual I brought out another guitar by the way to
show you guys just cuz I can I brought out the black beauty today now this is
just an epiphone black beauty but you know it's still very beautiful all gold
hardware I'm actually gonna change out these these pickups I have some toaster
hand wound pickups that are going in it look a little more Gretchy sound a
little more Gretchy yeah this is one of the babies though all bound it's the old
epiphone headstock which I wish it would have been one of the new ones that look
more Gibson II but it is so pretty isn't it just a beautiful I don't remember why
I got it if I was thinking I was gonna play some Mike Ness style stuff or what
but yeah I'm not usually I'm the less pickups are better but this case I went
for all three it's pretty anyway leave it up if you can this is gonna be posted
on patreon after this so if you guys want to rewatch run it through the
patreon stuff yeah this isn't a Gibson case too I don't remember where I got
the case set for that one are you a neck or bridge pickup kind of guy neck mostly
neck I like the neck sounds for punk rock and garage here's from now I bet
you're glad the headstock is OG yeah probably huh I just think it's so much
prettier the other headstocks are so much prettier but yeah I mean I wanted a
Gibson one but in the end after owning a bunch of Gibsons and a bunch of
epiphones I've determined I like the next better on on epiphone Les Pauls I
don't know why like they have something closer to a Gibson SG type neck from my
experience and I like that nice thin neck because I've got little lady hands
you know the the I'm not familiar with the the what is the story around the two
Tim there's way more way more way more cuts of Kim D than just two going around
yeah there's way more there's the sham D the Kim D the dirty D dead ringer the
Bundy sis and some of these are the same cuts just renamed a hundred times so
yeah I mean there's tons tons tons tons even Bodhi said his Ken three wasn't
real yeah it that Kim three came from a person that we know past fake cuts the
incognito dude but yeah I really tried with incognito he has a an amazing seed
collection by the way like it's not just shitting on the dude but he did in
interject a lot of bad cuts yeah just grab some super Kim D from fucker Joe
you just got screwed black metal he's one of the reasons we had this little
conversation sorry to hear that but you know it is what it is see one strain you
recommend from some recommend from you someone that's never got your gear
before I think about right Barry v3 right now like with what's available I'd
say like bubble berry cherry berry any of those just because they're so easy to
grow yeah yeah black metal I mean we talked about this a thousand times on
this show yeah so for the people new to it
tent flow actually has screenshots if you need to see them so yeah that dude
is not cool at all not cool he's also he doxxed me so I mean he's a dry snitch I
don't know why anybody fucking with that dude I made it real clear real fucking
clear about old fucker Joe no I don't an SD cat that would be a surprise to me
never heard of the dude when I was down there yeah in the J crew Sherman man
yeah I mean you know Bodhi is one of the archivists that I take very seriously I
love Bodhi radio Ridge has been doing an amazing job of sourcing legit
genetics for a long time and even before they even talk about him they run him
through a lot of people to make sure that they have a legit cut before they
declare having any kind of cut which yeah no it's the same guy black metal
you're definitely talking about the same idiot another dude let me give you
another example today and this is one that I probably should have fucking
slapped down much harder earlier on where is it where's the fake bull rider
maybe I don't have a picture of it ready
there's one dude was showing fake pictures of bull rider is this it that
this dude is dude nobody no no San Diego old-schoolers respect this dude have ever
heard of this dude before that he's a complete shithead he had made claims
that he and his partner made Afghani bull rider and he didn't know that there
was a difference between Afghani bull rider and original bull rider so now
since he's been made aware of that he's now claiming he has original bull rider
which is dead yeah there is that there is that little situation that it's not
alive anymore never mind that though that just details details details yeah
that if anybody wants a real bull rider cut the closest you're gonna get is old
Betsy and old Betsy hybrids right now and there's plenty of those available so
there's no reason to even even fuck with someone that stupid heard of P&W
Strain Hunter I have not I have not where did skunk one originate from us
that's probably the most known story in the history of cannabis and most
documented Sam the skunk man what is a true DJ to blueberry people say DJ
shorts I went through 23 blueberry cuts to find the one that smells like sour
milk and muffins DJ was the one who popularized the line called blueberry
but there have been other cuts called blueberry that didn't come from his
stuff from around the same time so I hope that helps what else we got
bullshit writer is correct yeah the RX farmer that was the Afghani bull rider
I was referring to not the old bull rider that I had in my backpack back
then it was called bull Ghani yeah like metal I'm guarantee it's the same dude
same dude we've all been talking about there's people in here who've been
ripped off by that dude that can tell you just as much it's not on my word
anyway what are some old clones that are still around that you would like to get
your hands on old clones that are still around I'd like to get my hands on
purple indica but it's not even you know what like even stuff like that via via
archive to CSI CSI is super honest with clones and sharing and it was asked not
to share so I've still never grown purple indica pure so like a clone like
that I'd be very interested in trying to think of some other one oh the corn the
corn's another one I'd be really interested in see what is the relation
of old Betsy and bull rider sister stock the the cuts came from the same
person so yeah and guys like Brandon rust wouldn't know that shit so but I
bet after this he'll be repeating it like it's fucking some shit he always
knew see that's a problem there's there are double-edged swords to putting info
out there like this yeah I ran some metal haze back in the day from Dutch
flowers we did some metal haze crosses it's a very interesting line pretty sure
it's positronics haze 19 crossed a skunk one that positronic sold for a long time
and it was renamed baby Yoda I've never even heard of baby Yoda to be selling it
for a thousand I mean you know again it's possible to buy clones that are
legit but no you're sourcing always ask questions don't just assume like and I
get it's very like you want to be that one dude who can source something and
and be like oh I'm the be like I'm the one who got it yes I'm one of the very
few rare people to have this rare cut but nine times out of ten that's not
gonna happen it just isn't so Tom Hill Hayes skunk one no Tom Hills Hayes was a
selection from positronics Hayes 19 but it probably was nothing like the same
pheno because there were so many different phenos so but similar yes have
you run much of the legends of chimera stuff firstly yeah that was some of my
favorite stuff back in the day I ran you can see from chimera sassy frass mental
floss mental floss was my favorite out of the chimera stuff let's see what else
from legends Johnny Blaze legends ultimate indica there's another one yeah
those are the top ones from both of them that I really really dug how about that
archive post dude selling what yeah we talked about that a little bit ago yeah
it's is what it is that's what what kind of is is helping foster these situations
is people like that you know but did El Jefe verified cuts of his elites so
jefe what have they did was he made it into our circle and I remember I was
talking about people that get into circles and rip people off and get
booted out that's exactly what he did everybody in the circle was very open
with each other and with clones and jefe got a lot of clones from everyone in the
group and ripped everyone off and immediately started selling them against
everybody's wishes he's one of the reasons and a perfect example of someone
who's a fucking piece of shit that does that luckily he lost most of them and
and some of me was handed were fake so we can be thankful for that but yeah it's
a shame it's a shame what's the one cut that you haven't worked with that you
would grab if you could I'll go with corn on that one just cuz yeah if it
was hilarious until he wasn't I agree he damaged and burned every bridge he
possibly could have fucking had which made a lot of sense because he when he
came to our crew he didn't really have any friends corn is an old cut for that
archive has you'd have to ask him what what it actually is and the story behind
it I don't remember what was purple pain there were a few different purple pains
but purple champagne was supposed to be the the derb the f1 derb it's been
called a thousand different things so stay trippy who is who is he with the
fake Death Star I don't know how big a fairy Fino variation would you see in
chem 91 s1s I haven't run them but just from observing people pop them online
and talking to CSI it sounds like it has a fairly good amount of variation stuff
that looks like sour all the way to stuff looks like pure Afghani I don't
know what copy genetics is double purple doja um I don't that was that's always
been pretty rare so if people pop up at the day I'm always skeptical but Fairfax
election according to the icy mag forums but there's more than one corn on there
Fairfax election I'm not sure it might be four-way selection could be could be
Jeff take make Afghani bull rider I don't know I mean I I smoked it sold it
Afghani bull rider bud but I never really cared because it like who did
what because it wasn't bull rider didn't have anything to do with it I don't
think how's the NL preservation project going great going great Death Star I
didn't know LFA used a Death Star so I wouldn't know I wouldn't know that shit
from which I was ridiculous he brought that to a party I was the first can
Illuminati party and he was just invited in to come to the party and he showed up
with his Death Star he'd been fucking banging on about how dank it was and I
took one look and one smells like well fuck you got skunk one you got skunk
one bro and if you can't tell that you shouldn't be trading cuts but yeah I
don't know this is fucking funny yeah that shit was garb though I mean it was
okay for skunk one but you know it wasn't Death Star that's for damn sure
didn't jet I don't want it I'm not gonna get sit here talking about some fucking
nobody the whole time I'm looking forward to that project to cross the nl5
to one of those p91 s well it's not a bad idea I think that could be very nice
like a older Afghani base yeah I'd be really cool I've already talked about
that like I said I'm not gonna keep bringing up or spending time on a
fucking nobody but yeah Death Star OG is great too I'm not sure which one
you're referring to or what that is yeah so that's that's a rough treatise on how
you should verify cuts how you go get these cuts yeah it's really there's not
a great shortcut I'm sorry it's not a great shortcut sometimes it takes years
to get a cut and sometimes you'll never get it just as what it is you can't
people calling things elites has caused a lot of different ideas about what
these cuts are and how good they are everything is subjective so what I
consider elite may not be what you consider elite but back in the day it
was a consensus value given to stuff if something kept getting passed because
there wasn't the online hype system and Instagram for pictures and what's and
whatnot if things kept getting passed it was because they were naturally hyping
themselves because they were dank and after a certain point enough people
agreed that this clone is dank that's how you got in a league cut nowadays
it's anything that gets thrown on Instagram that some hype schmuck wants
you to think you know is legit okay what do you think the relationship between
super skunk and chem is if any I think chem 91 is a pure super skunk that's
just my best guess but pretty pretty sure on that one first-class genetics is
the number one in legit cuts well I'm glad you know that because I don't I
don't know that I'm sure the guy's nice but I just he's not in our circle so I
don't know anything about what he has
what's up fatty Gainesville green still going around I've never seen a real cut
of Gainesville green in my life seen a lot of fake cuts of it anything about
fire alien ramen that was OG rascal and it was a seed line oh you have Cuban
black haze cool that's what I was talking about like that incognito guy
that's one of the ones he brought to the table along with 10-3 and big mass super
skunk so yeah y'all getting y'all getting skunked
y'all getting skunked we got some stuff first class I can fill you in definitely
not unhappy that's good see that's it that's a good good call as long as this
stuff you know what it is in the first place before you get it other way I mean
things can be this is where some confusion also comes in because things
can be dank right you can get a fake clone that's super dank probably even
better than the than the clone only however does that make it legit you know
you have to know them you have to be able to identify something in the first
place before you can verify it yeah you just got to know you have to know it in
advance what's the difference in Amherst sour AJ sour ACSD Amherst sour new to me
I mean like I get like people were saying it was from Amherst so someone
smacked Amherst on the front of a sour cut I don't know anything about that
sour cut I only know easy SD the Choco same thing the AJ sour was very dank but
what AJ considers his sour now was nothing like the old AJ sour cut so yeah
salt and lime never heard of that no see like the Cuban black haze a lot of
people like it but is that what it is I don't know don't know I know where it
came from and I know that it I know the provenance on it and that that guy passed
two other fake cuts when he passed that cut so yeah yeah the archive cut of sour
would be the same thing as the Choco the ECSD etc so those are the same exact cuts
if you're comparing archives versus Choco they're the same cuts who was the original
trainwreck so the original trainwreck supposedly was nothing like the train
wreck that got pushed by AE 32 and the arcaded trainwreck it was much different
before that but the one that gets past the most is like that lemon eater
pendling one and that's what most people yeah and Mandel crotch put the Amherst
on the name again no surprise do I think the AJ sour I used was the original sour
no I think the Choco ECSD is the original sour I do but I mean who knows
again that's not one we can take back to the total beginning because there's no
true there's no true like agreement between the original guys that had the sour on what
that sour is now I don't think any of them could identify it today by any stretch of
the imagination and we tried we tried to get him to do it so found an incredible trainwreck
Fino in bubblegum breath crosses that make why is there a trainwreck Fino's in bubblegum breath
crosses that's weird I did maybe I don't know what bubblegum breath is how old time was an
Amherst that said it was the original sour originally from New York upstate it is from
New York upstate but it was not called Amherst sour no one's ever called it Amherst sour back
then as far as I know it was called our diesel and that's the original name so I mean people
can call whatever they want but they shouldn't if they're talking about original sour it's not
super debatable possibly a couple sours at first though yes yeah yeah and the other original name
for it was the manny from those guys so there is also that I didn't know what Mendo breath is
basically Mendo perps and trainwreck Mendo breath is not Mendo perps and trainwreck bro it's OG
breath and probably a mental perps trainwreck but OG kush breath being the main part of it
chem dog had fake chem 91 in high times why would you trust and what any of them say that's hard
hard to argue with are there land races that get is commonly knocked off as ties I don't know on
that one I don't know your opinion what breeders are killing it right now and why a few episodes
ago I did a long list of breeders that are are people that I trust and that are doing some cool
shit so yeah that hit back a few episodes and you could probably find that moontide that's a good
that's another fair statement like like those those smells don't necessitate a lot more than
most of the things associated with like the skunk files and stuff like that skunky tiles are
hermaphroditic tendencies and low potency and that's for real but people want what they don't
know and can't have so many old elites look like ugly-ass plants I guess turps and highs were a
bit more important for a lot of them I think in modern times people equate looking good with
dankness that would be the Instagram era of growers and I don't agree with that at all not
even a little bit some of the most beautiful shit like blackberry kush is some of the worst potency
on earth like you know men no purpose is fucking beautiful not super potent you know but it has
great turps yeah there's any name any cookies hybrid I don't think it's that fucking great
but it's pretty so it sells yeah I'm not sure yet pyramid haven't run any yet that's right
Jean Jean knows what's up can't smoke with your fucking eyes boys yeah it's uh it's like the
people that that run tests and think that's a great example of how to pick your weed and what
to sell by THC volume but you know they did people haven't even looked at the entourage effect at all
hogs breath is a beautiful example yeah it's not wasn't the most gorgeous but it was one of those
that hyped itself because it was fucking ding that's absolutely true man fuck a gene we're
gonna get gene on here eventually eventually he will do it he will do it and come hang out and
shoot the shit do you think microbes and fungi and soil contribute to the flavor of weed I think
the root zone is where it does all that that exchanging of stuff so sure I think sulfur
added sulfur helps with with turps and stuff like that yeah favorite chem to smoke I liked chem one
because it was so different than the other chems and I like uh giselle other than that if we're
just saying like just chem chems well I guess that would depend on what chem is right uh chem 91 nl5
hey it's chem 4 is one of my other faves what's a strain that subverted your expectations because
of how ugly it was columbian black it was beautiful to me because I knew its potential
but it was just an airy mess of tiny little um tiny little bubbles of bud everywhere but it was
it was amazing smoke
dilat yeah dilat has a lot of that same look that like the columbian black did just stringy
you know um a lot like uh what people called grinspoon that was originally quays what happened
to good widow probably the same thing that happened with everything else from the 90s people just
overdid it got sick of it lots of renames um lots of bad impressions of weed that was not widow
stuff like that how do you feel now that tissue culture has really started to gain momentum and
become more available with honest people
ask fatty I haven't ever since I got screwed by by mooney moon dog on on tissue culturing I've
stayed so far away from it and don't care because it's just a bad experience but I know my boy fatty
has been doing some some cool shit with it uh dog walker og is kind of ugly it smokes fantastic I
I think it's kind of pretty it smokes great though he got he did not get the cut from gray skull
brandon did not get the cut from gray skull because gray skull doesn't have the fucking cut
gray skull will tell you doesn't have the cut I had the last of gray skull's bull rider seeds and
they weren't gonna pop so they had to take him to a tissue culture guy not sure what's up with
that since then but brandon did not get shit from fucking gray skull gray skull would never
fuck with that kid god what a say but I mean and again brandon rust is a noob but people just think
for some reason because he says he's not that he isn't people are liars you got to ask the people
themselves why don't you ever smoke weed during lies one I don't want to get them shut down two
I can't answer fast if I'm stoned just can't I've tried a few live and uh stoned and that
just doesn't work out well so either you want info or you want me stoned one of the two
but you can't have both
yeah I don't know that gray ever had bull rider um he had the seeds that we had here and that's
a bag seed and that was that as far as I know so yeah know what you're talking about don't just
trust people because they say they're legit and old school and they show a picture of a plant and
veg saying it's something don't don't just accept that as as true please I beg of you guys don't
because it all it does is is fuck everything up where can I get some cuts of Steve Murphy
Afghani I'm sure you can find someone that'll sell you some Steve Murphy Afghani if you keep
asking around I'm sure Brandon Russ will sell you some of Steve Murphy's Afghani yeah um I don't know
anybody currently keeping cuts of Steve Murphy's Afghani how is the CSI NL project going it's going
great going great they overgrew everything really fast it's obviously some kind of Afghani hybrid
which is what we want from uh uh NL5 um that gives more truth to what it's supposed to be
because we are always going to keep making sure that it is what we think it is do you know what
Steve Murphy Afghani is yeah Afghani or actually that it as it was told to me it could be a
Pakistani or Afghani they weren't sure it was a girl who went over and brought them back to
Steve Murphy so it could be Pakistani or Afghani but she was it was picked up somewhere along
that line weasel with the diesel say sour d came from his headband siege which is cam 91
northern lights so weasel with the diesel has told so many different stories respect to him
nice dude but I I've heard too many different stories coming out dude's mouth to be very
reliable but we do know von doh and von doh has been the most reliable and consistent when it
comes to stories about the sour and um and yeah weasel with the diesel knows von doh too and they
were roommates but he's been the most consistent and out of the spotlight wants nothing to do with
any fame glory from northern or from sour so yeah how is golden coast vintage Afghani it was a
short squat little creamy hashy Afghani nothing great but uh it was pretty
anything about cause I don't even know who cosmic wisdom is sorry um
would we get a shawnee kids he just did an episode with me
how would you describe the nose on instruction on Pakistani to troll kush depending on
depending on the phenotype you can get like blackberry the green pheno showed a lot of
lemon and there's a lot of terpenelein mixed in but there's other notes too um yeah Caleb would
be the person I mean CSI would be the person to talk about with that anywhere von doh story can
be found we brought von doh into our circle and interviewed him extensively and I just told it to
you so that's about the best place you're going to get it unless you're friends with him so do
you believe that sour cake from head sour came from headband those guys can't even agree on who
named headband let alone um any of it I've watched several people from that group including AJ JJ and
and maybe one of them did name it but JJ says he's named it AJ said he's named it and I believe
and I believe Klopp said he's named it uh weasel so who knows who knows maybe one of them did maybe
one of them didn't but sour was before that so it would make it very hard for sour to come from
headband how do you pick a name for a strain don't ask me I come with dumb ass names
if you're if you have autism and you're trying to make friends
and be social for cuts that's going to be pretty hard um find a group that understands that
I mean we're all I would be hard pressed to find a group of seed makers that are real serious into
this and real serious into collecting that aren't on the spectrum in some way shape or form
um most of my best friends have some level of autism spectrum
um blackberry was a bag seed by soma blaze correct probably mendoperps
um all of it's probably net mendoperps you can find everything that they described as blackberry
in mendoperps so I'm guessing it's mendoperps bag seed that they didn't want to admit
favorite terpinoline dominant clone um I really like the amnesia haze uh um columbian black
that's another one flight of portland ship yourself some yeah there you go that's there
you go thoughts on breeder love in her eyes I don't know anything about them they're very new
to me I don't know if they're new to the scene in general but they're very new to me some pretty
pictures though uh no nebu's blackberry was from sunny's black rush you're backwards uh black
russian was cherry ak-47 nebu's blackberry and nebu's blackberry was probably from mendoperps
what makes an og and og you know there's so many cuts out there is it just about there being
similar traits and a bag seed story yes it's roughly yes know anything about the blood derby
ncsis I do not there are a lot of different blackberry cushions out there uh sunny's black
russian it wasn't sunny's it was um the black russian was nebu's nebu's so you try to like
the chem one yes it's very different from um the other chems it's not super what people would
associate with chemi however I think it would be great in a cross with dog shit because they are
both uh nl5 haze dominant probably some skunk one in there too um it I think you'll get more
of a traditional dutch um nl5 haze type by running across the two than most of what I what
other stuff you could buy right now what are you growing now uh I'll put that on a back burner for
now talking about it just because I don't want people saying that they've made what I just made
so yeah I watched the original diesel episode the other day have you ever ever seen the forum thread
of when chem dog visited sub cool at his house yes headband was one of the strains chem dog had
yes and chem chem dog himself has told me he's never had headband
you know I guess it just depends on what day you ask I like I like chem dog greg he's a friend
I really do but um you know unless you have copious notes it's been fucking x amount of
years he was really young when all that was going on it's very hard to keep track of any of that
but urinal cake that sounds lovely come come smoke some urinal cake with me
hockey puck urinal cake but yeah
cookettes that was a good name I agree I think you would really like this super glue cut
afghani northern lights yeah I mean when I see stuff like northern lights in a in a
in a lineage like that where there's no number to it no nothing and knowing which northern lights
were over here and which ones weren't it are already I mean it could be super dank but I
couldn't ever use it in anything because I just wouldn't can't chase the provenance on it and I
can't say what it is unless it was super exceptional you know
I'd be surprised if anyone remembered anything after visiting so that's true that's true
have you ever seen any Ethiopian strains making its way up yeah there's people that
people people have sold Ethiopian strains before I don't know much about it in that
can you talk about to see us uh well I can't I didn't understand what you're asking
have you smoked the metal haze bodhi is about to release I've smoked metal haze plenty and
bred with it but I don't know about the one that he's using uh anything about dr atomic
been trying to get him on the the show we'll see how it goes uh did you get your f1 derm back nope
not yet any idea what the harsh chemical spray paint permanent marker fumes type smells could
come from different terpenes combinations of thiols terpenes esters etc
who is real humboldt seed company hso hsc csi well csi is uh humboldt original hsc was the
first person to have humboldt seed co but I have no respect for them for many other reasons and hso
split off I thought I think I may be wrong but as I've heard it's one of the people split off
from humboldt seed co and started humboldt seeds org where does the african haze come from which
african haze there's like senegal haze that was a combination of two african land races
with no haze in it um yeah I don't know yeah I've been trying I've been working on dr atomic but
he's not he's not a big internet dude so it's been a little um hard but I think it would be
I think he'd be a great person to interview he's been around a long time he's you know made some
cool shit bubble man mentioned the clones dog game we're covered in pm those were the days
yeah I'm not sure on um I'm not sure on the african haze from
yeah I just I haven't kept up on what what he's been working with
any other questions about provenance clones genetics in general
anything that I might know about have you tried any transky south african strains I have tried
transky tried swazi early in the early on durban I wasn't a big fan of south africans if I'm being
honest like they tended to be um high high yielding commercial grade for africa
which is you know I dressed up for this I dressed up for you I dressed up for you
let's see thoughts on reversal sometimes plants don't sack up they're more look like bananas
normal yeah um different reversals go different ways did st george make girl scout cookies
absolutely not it's a bullshit story um but it is a story that keeps being spread nonetheless
I've actually tried to get a hold of him to put his story on the record and they will not do it
will not put it on the record but it would be easily trounced easily um I did ask the original
cookies dudes to uh talk about it and we'll see hopefully they will hopefully they'll be
interested in it what terpene or combo of terpenes make blueberry smell mercine and then different
doodle doots ever run out any of skunk man's gear back in the icy mag days yes the uh
taihei skunk one um what else did I run a fucking there were a bunch of freebies that were given out
by sam the skunk man back in the day I did run some of the uh the stuff that they sold through
dna is the skunk train that sam had made too who is on shango los talking about it st george or
maybe he was just fucking being a dick to me either way he's not the dude um that's that's
it's pretty well documented uh where cookies came from pretty well documented
does a trinity cut you are all using a berry turps no
um I think that the people who made cookies know what it is but don't really um
don't really want to put the full recipe out there I it's very easy to remake cookies so
yeah I've heard what st george says it is but yeah it's one of those things where
so many people want to take credit for it that there's so much bullshit out there
what is up with seed stunky that dude's a fucking lop he chose to go with corporate assholes and
got booted from our scene of friends because he just chose to work with snitches and that's what
happens
cherry pie pakistani to trolley no way in hell no way in hell or you'd find constant terpenele
or you'd find constant terpenele digging all that up um there's no urkel or og kush in
that combination so yeah no plants tell the truth people tell stories I always go back to that
cookies was life-changing oh lord any backstory in starfighter no that was already when I stopped
when that pop came out I had already stopped paying attention to everything like
that new people were doing
any work with you and smellboat on the back burner no I smellboat's been doing his own
thing he's you know he's got he's a daddy he's got life so he hasn't really been um
he hasn't really been doing much but yeah he's a good dude one of the friends I hope it'd be nice
to see him get back to it also because he grew really dink we need always bring it to me you
think cookies og urkel I think there's a little bit more to it but I think
most of these expressions that you see in cookies is an og urkel combination
yeah you know um eddie leapfrog was responsible for a green sherb
that is different than the cookie fam sherb um one is more responsible for skittles one is just not
that's why there's a lot of confusion around that I heard m39 yes skunk one uh and then another
skunk one northern light five haze or just skunk one nl5 I can't remember um I think it's skunk one
nl5 haze some combo thereof the male pakistani to troll was an urkel morph get out of here with
that shit get out of that yeah that's fucking silly that is silly basic five is the nl5 version
that sssc was using in m39 yeah nl5 skunk haze I think what's the optimal thc cvd terse
percentage depends on what you want out of it for your body chemistry
any thoughts on dick horse genetics never heard of him never heard of her never heard of her
ever asked any question over and over even though he keeps passing it
I don't know what you're referring to I'm trying to catch everything much about the hardcore og
clone from west coast cuts now I don't know anything about that shit ever try malawi gold
nl5 haze I have not yet not yet what can I expect to find in your cherry gmo skittles
some cherry jume some cherry pies some gmo and some skittles and everything in between
that's the most honest answer I can give because there's tons of phenos it's a polyhybrid
what regs you got for so that you'd recommend any of the blue bonnet stuff I'm happy with all
of it it just depends on what you like out of weed that's the most honest answer I can give you know
best way to stabilize a herm that's a winner it just depends on the actual clone it depends on
what you want to get out of it if you want something that is as close to that clone as
possible it's going to take lots of breeding what out of your current line what's your current go
to when you smoke who I really like the cherry berry a lot um um the blue resin kush is fucking
bomb um I'm a big fan of blue like berry ogs and stuff I think they combine really well especially
if you get that like fruit loops if you know out of the og pushing some berry that's some beautiful
shit how do you stabilize a herm it depends on the line it's not there's no just one method for
stabilizing all herms herms things herm for different reasons in different lines and different
combinations the beloved kush I too love blue bubble too how did Bodhi make Appalachia he did
not uh Heinlunza made the Appalachia and that was green crap crust a tray dog nobody knows the true
origin of the skittles gene would know he's up there with those dudes it's up for debates
apparently I know some people are more confident about confident about it than others can you talk
about bubble gum and how it got to Holland um Victor if I remember correctly Victor was the
dude that brought it over the seeds you can find it on Adam Dunn's 25th anniversary of bubble gum I
think that's when they had Victor and um two trees on and that was the most legitimate as far
as I know the most legitimate story that has been given about that would you say seedfinder.eu it
has legit info sometimes I mean anybody could add any info I've never added a single strain to
seed finder and all my shit's up there and a lot of it's wrong so anybody could add info up there
and if anybody could add info up there then there's bound to be right and wrong
I don't that Illinois bubble gum story is kind of suspect I don't that was not a Victor story that
was an Adam Dunn story so I don't I don't buy that so is there an Appalachian male
Appalachia was a seed line so yeah there were males females there was all kinds of stuff
I think it's a F4 F4 last by Hein Lonesome
who's dick do I gotta suck for some legit green crack s1s I made some back in the day
and if you could find someone with those they're legit I don't know I might make some more soon
we'll see but uh green crack is much harder to source than it was at one time I have
seen so much green crack and so much fake green crack since
Gene's 100% confident that nobody knows well then you're Gene knows he's there he's in that
friend circle of everyone that was fucking around with the the trays and and the the green sherb and
all that shit what strains are great for headaches any it just depends on your brain chemistry I'd
love to give people answers like that but I just it's just it's just it's just it's just
I'd love to give people answers like that but I just wouldn't be honest to just be like yeah this
will work for it you know are we gonna bring back the purple drink back wasn't it GSE it was GSE
cross to let's see I you know I don't remember them all in it but I know it was during the
Suge Knight OG cross to the west coast dog uh trying to remember the mall minute it's been a
long time what is fake green crack usually not real green crack it's a green crack's pretty
easily easy to identify visually or smoking wise is green sherb also called key lime pie some
people call it that some people say they're the same thing I've only ever had key lime pie I've
never had anything in my hands called green sherb so I don't know uh not sure you might know that
one better butterscotch g13 g13 wasn't around when the butterscotch wine was passed around but
there was a g13 hash plant that was as anyone yes dookie rose cut as giddles yes that's the one that
CSI uses that is this skittles cut that I know that I've used it's uh not a very healthy looking
plant it's a little wiry and wrangly I don't know what do you think gene on the on the dookie
brothers I defer to guys like gene and and and CSI that are up in that area because they are
actually interacting with those folks down on the ground there and seeing things like down on the
ground and they'd be much better to answer those questions specifically than myself that's giddles
cut sucks I'm not gonna lie that thing's a piece of shit um I get why people like it because it
is terpy but it just structure-wise it's a piece of shit who's got skywalker og who knows now I've
seen a million different skywalker ogs isn't key lime pie assisted at the end guess it depends who
you ask uh vhg twizard any insight on the green curry cut it sounds like whatever he had is the
green curry cut was the same thing that we had as diablo og down in san diego um it was like a
spicy black peppery with og turps it was very specific I tried the original chili verde that
actually smelled like chili verde back in the day from hbk it was bomb it was unique very very
fucking unique um there's other chili type plants in the gmo cherry skittles but yeah that was cool
yeah that chili verde was was tight old school spice lab blockhead no lineage was it project 19
who was that african something project 19 it's been a long time since i've been asked that
what's up with ag hbk i haven't talked to him um a lot in a while but i need to get back a hold of
him i should probably give him a call we live close together and we've been friends for quite a
while um i guess burning bush nursery said key lime came from them and it's a gse fino hash plant
looking thing huh i don't know i released s1s of the the key lime pie cut they were very very
frosty but they did look like they looked very skittlesy and skittles looked very similar to that
that the cut that came from jodrey i will say that he's been bumming oh that sucks man yeah
i'll give him a call
males and world phylotaxy what gives i see it often on males in some lines specifically chem
91 pckf2 it's interesting um it's not like necessarily a male trait but maybe it's something
from those uh specific genetic being combined favorite shitty strain there you go ortega sweet
ortega sweet tooth but what's the where's the project 19 in it
and blockhead is it project 19 ortega sweet tooth that might be what it is
that might be what it is but i remember ortega sweet tooth you are correct about that being in it
wasn't that louis so is it p19 louis louis being legends ultimate indica
since that's what ortega sweet tooth is
i can't remember i can't remember at all
or is it just p19 sweet tooth is giddles skunk one dominant no not in structure at all
um turps i can see some skunk one in it but i wouldn't say it's skunk one dominant as far as
like the expression the structure or any of that cream sodica who cream sodica was from
that's a spice of life one too no no that's right fatty you guys did grow a bunch of the blockhead
they had um who was it was chrome's cut chrome chrome from swamp boys had an amazing cut of
blockhead amazing i think that's the one that was down there with um tiara rojo's crew it was cool
i like that that kind of blockhead
nigerian silk i'm not i never tried nigerian silk or any of it so i couldn't comment
did burning bush i have no clue on that when it comes to the the progenitors of like key lime
pie and that stuff i have no clue have you ever had any mango cuts yeah i had a bc mango cut
mango haze old betsy's kind of mango ish um green crack is very mango
yeah a bunch of different kinds of mango what was the highway man i can't remember that one
what's that district uh homegrown best guess on closest relative to which
tk star dog oh that's interesting
blue dot that was an old uh collective clone for a certain place and i remember there was
a second blue dot that came out i don't know what was used in um dutch flowers
uh blue dot stuff that was made to make used to make blowfish not so headband la cush
you know if you have any other questions i'm happy to answer them um this will be up on patreon after
this will be up on patreon after this when you plant seeds you number them seed one through 300
or one through 20 right one through 80 well we did about i think only like 15 strains uh 15 scenes
on this phenomenon and the number 20 was just popping when you plant seeds you number them
seed one through 300 or one through 20 right one through 80 well we did about i think only like 15
strains uh 15 scenes on this phenomenon and the number 20 was just popping when you plant seeds
