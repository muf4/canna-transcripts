It was like I was connected with everything around me.
All of a sudden I just started questioning everything I'd ever been told.
You know, by the time I got high that very first time,
when it started to hit me,
and I'm like, wow.
I got high.
You want to be known?
Yep, that's fine.
Okay. With Johnny, one of the Mad Jag's partners from the Mad Jag Canyon.
And we're going to have a little discussion about the Mad Jag era
and his perspective on everything that went down and his experiences from his angle.
So Mad Jag didn't help me lead on this because he knows the important questions.
And I kind of just want to sit back, maybe ask a few things here and there.
a few things here and there,
but let you two have a conversation about those years,
because that's what people really want to hear.
So let's take it away, Mad Jag.
Well, the other day I was speaking with Matthew
and trying to give him some history of how I met you.
And it started pretty far back with my friendship
with Doug and then Hardy,
because Hardy's wife was, what was her name?
Amanda.
Amanda.
Okay, I couldn't remember Amanda.
Amanda's the one who invited you
and Wally and Martin, right?
Well, she, I was in, well, to go back to the source,
which is the weed, would you believe?
I was living in Manchester, England with Martin and Alison,
both of whom you came to know later.
And Amanda had already moved to Phoenix.
I had known her in Birmingham and through Martin.
They were an item.
Anyway, we were both studying film at Manchester University
and Amanda sent us some of the original Mad Jag,
I think 78.
And we smoked, we saw these tiny little joints,
and back then, Matthew, you probably,
you know, or maybe you're too young,
but we would make splits out of five skin joints.
It was like quite an operation.
So to add tobacco in and stuff?
Exactly, lots of tobacco.
You had to be able to smoke tobacco.
You needed some content in there with the leaf matter.
Right, well, hash.
No, no, what I was gonna say was it was hash mostly.
And then we had this little present from Arizona,
from Amanda in a little vacuum pack.
We saw these tiny little joints, you know?
So the two of us, Martin and I,
and there was another fellow there
who was sharing our little house in Manchester
and we thought, oh, what the hell is this?
We proceeded to smoke the entire thing,
you know, between two of us.
And 20 minutes later, we're in the catatonic stage.
We just had never experienced, you know,
hashing stage, as you know better than I,
you know, is much more different.
Hi to the grass.
And Jim, the mad jag there had grown the mad jag,
you know, I think that was your year before.
You did it with Doug Jimbo or?
No, it was with Doug.
Right, okay, so it must have been that year, yeah.
So what year was that?
Was that 78?
Yep, yep.
You know, Jim, I think it was sooner.
I think it came sooner.
My recollection is that because,
well, maybe not, but anyway,
no, I think it was sooner.
Anyway, it was grass as opposed to hash, that's the point.
And it was, and we were completely ripped, you know,
for four or five hours, barely able to function
because we'd completely overdone it, you know.
Yeah.
And anyway.
So I have some questions for you.
Since you were in Manchester, what year,
what era was this, roughly, 70s?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 76, 77.
You know, we went there in the autumn of 76.
It was a one-year film course.
I was already working at the BBC,
and stop me when you've had enough of all this.
No, no.
Working in the BBC, and then I went to study film
to advance my career, if it was.
And anyway, and I spent a year up there.
So we were there from 76 to June 77, autumn 76.
So that's the year.
Where were you raised in England?
I was brought up on a farm in Devonshire.
In Devonshire, okay.
Yeah, if you know England at all.
That's the southwest corner.
My dad was a farmer, and we had a lovely childhood
on a farm in Devon, yeah.
And then I went to Birmingham University,
the teacher training part.
After a year, I wanted to be a teacher,
which never really, really worked.
I can agree to that, yeah.
Yeah.
So Birmingham, great cities, these, if I may.
Birmingham and Manchester, great music scenes.
I collect music from the punk rock and Northern Soul,
specifically Northern Soul, like 70s, 60s Northern Soul.
And the reggae stuff that was coming in
during the late 70s and late 60s, early 70s to Manchester,
I collect all of that stuff, all of it.
And Birmingham, don't forget.
Oh yeah, Birmingham, yeah, huge.
Sorry, it's close to my heart.
I had six or seven great years there.
And Birmingham, we used to go to the ska and reggae.
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.
We got to know through my work at the BBC,
we got all these characters come in and-
Don Letts was big out there at the BBC, Don Letts, the DJ?
Have you heard of him?
No, I don't remember.
Say it again, the name?
Don Letts, he was an old reggae DJ for the-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that name.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And of course, one of the reasons Jim invited me,
and I've written a book about this, about, you know this.
Yeah, so a lot of that reference to my time in Birmingham
is in this novel that's actually, I'm working on the last,
anyway, it's on my bed here,
but I'm working on the last read-through.
It's gonna come out, and I'll be glad to send you a copy.
Oh, I'd love it.
Anyway, long story, but that's, yeah, yeah,
Birmingham was wonderful back then,
and great clubs too, and tremendous bands.
ELO and Spencer Davis that became-
Spencer Davis, oh yeah, yeah.
Led Zeppelin just ran the corner, and Wolverhampton,
and lots of stunning bands.
But yeah, the Ska and the reggae scene was tremendous,
and some of the Jamaican guys would take over
these whole streets of row houses.
Oh yeah.
You could always call them terraces,
we call them in England.
And one house would be dedicated for the shabbeens,
they called them, which is the parties, you know?
Oh wow.
Yeah, and I remember going there the first time
with three or four mates.
We were the only white guys there, you know?
And we were tolerated.
I don't know how welcome we were,
but when you went in, you know,
the guy would hand you a cone of ganja,
you know, as they called it.
You know, the way they grew the grass in Jamaica.
Yeah.
And you'd have one each, you know?
That's awesome.
You know?
And they'd be playing that really cool laid back ska
and reggae, and what a scene, you know?
And everybody ripped, of course.
I would have, that's what I would dream
to have been around for.
Like if I could go back in a time machine,
would be to see that era of England.
Because the music, the ska, the reggae scene,
and how many people it influenced later on.
Yeah, that's amazing to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was fun.
It was great times, man.
We were wild, you know?
Or in fact, you know, when I came to Arizona,
Jim probably saved my life, you know?
Because if we'd carried on with that,
we would have been finished at 50, you know?
Yeah, I know you.
Yeah.
So I was just, go ahead.
Was it a hash culture in England?
Like was that, was it kind of mostly hash over there?
We seldom saw grass, at least in the scenes I was in.
As I say, the ganja that the Jamaicans brought in,
of course, from the Caribbean,
was the closest we saw to any leaf, you know?
Oh, wow.
Okay.
We got the Lebanese, the blonde Lebanese.
Sometimes, and then the, also the Afghani.
Yeah.
Sometimes the Afghani was streaked with white.
And I don't know, we used to, maybe we were dreaming,
but we think it was opium, innit, you know?
Oh, maybe, yeah.
I've heard about that.
So I was watching a video the other day,
and they were showing the process
of how the hash is mixed and made in Afghanistan.
And what they were doing was bringing in,
they had the nice hash, the creamy, beautiful stuff,
and they had it all melted down, you know,
really worked real heavy,
and they were throwing in the garbage on top of it.
Garbage.
It's a little bit of opium.
Oh!
A little bit of, like the crappy hash from the air.
And they were mixing it all in
so that they could sell it for a higher price.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They were mixing in all kinds of crap
just to sell it for a higher price.
And apparently they do this each year,
and it's an old practice of mixing the bad hash
with the good hash.
But yeah, they also mix in, supposedly, opium,
from what that said.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the streaks.
You know, we remember the white streaks in it.
The Afghani was the sought after.
Lebanese was okay.
Moroccan was okay.
You know, well, fine, you know.
But the Afghani, everybody wanted that,
and it was quite a bit more powerful, you know.
And we always thought, because it was, you know,
really, you know, you didn't feel much pain
for five or six hours after having some of that stuff.
It was tremendous, you know.
But we always, you know, and it was an education,
if I may go on to Arizona, you know,
to meet Jimbo and yeah, smoke the,
that would have been,
Jim and I worked for two years in the canyon.
My book only chronicles one,
but I remember the first meeting,
Jim, David Hardy's this guy that was married
to the English girl, that's the connection, you know.
And smoking grass in the morning, you know,
I was thinking, wow, you know,
because we only, in England, it was, you know,
you went out and had five pints of strong beer.
Yeah, yeah.
Back and you were, you know,
you couldn't move hardly, laugh or.
I bet.
A girl with you, you might be able to,
you know, mischief with her,
but mostly it was, you know,
you just laid out, right?
Yeah.
But that was the introduction to grass
and how much more invigorating it was
as opposed to innovating, you know.
Yes.
The oxidization, you guys know better than I do.
Sure.
You know, when that was the trouble
with the small sticks and seeds
that came in from Mexico, right?
And Columbia, it was, it zonked you out,
you got high, but it wasn't invigorating.
And that's what turned me on to the mad jagweed
was this, you know, you have a puff in the morning.
We used to go and throw the football around
and David Hardy had a little park opposite there.
You may, I'm sure remember that Jim, but you know.
Yeah, buddy.
The reason why I said 78 is that's when Doug and I grew.
And before that, I only grew once with Robert
and I didn't have, I didn't know David Hardy yet or Amanda.
So it was Doug and I, our first year in 78.
Well, maybe I'm inventing this story to make it
because that's what I wrote about in the book.
But anyway, but I remember,
I guess it was the whole point was that it was grass,
you know, and those little New York needles
as opposed to the, to the chunk of hash used to get
and we'd break off a bit of hash and we'd heat it.
You guys know all that, right?
And then you crumble it into the tobacco where this,
but the grass that we smoked in Manchester that year
was the first real, you know, neat, strong grass.
I don't know.
It was since a mere, it didn't have seeds.
The one she did not exactly.
It was since a mere.
Yeah.
So that makes sense though, because the,
even the Jamaican Colombian, well,
I don't know about Jamaican, probably a Colombian Mexican.
A lot of that stuff was, you know, dried in the sun.
So it was all just oxidized to shit.
And it can be heavy CBN, you're going to be tired.
It's going to wear you out.
So that's what most people were used to.
When you got like that fresh grown, not oxidized,
not sun dried, not gold weed.
I'm sure that was just so energizing.
Yeah. Yeah.
For sure.
And, and, and I think that Jim was probably in
at the very early stages of, I mean,
I think it was Humboldt County, of course,
is famous for starting it probably in the mid seventies.
Right.
The guys learning how to pull the males and,
and how to, how to, and the three, the,
the vital three, four days after you cut it,
you know how you took care of it.
And, and that was an idea again that I developed,
which didn't actually happen.
You know, it's a novel what I wrote.
And, and the second part is about going down to Mexico
and to Oaxaca, which was the origin of the seeds, you know.
Yeah.
Jim, if I don't throw him under the bus here,
I think the statute of limitations is run out,
but you know, his connections down there
with, with some characters.
Anyway, that's, that's later in the story.
And, and yeah, it was grass was, was, was, you know,
opened our minds in a way, in every sense.
You know, the, the, the cinnamia green,
the green, I think we used to call it.
I'm not an expert on these strains or anything.
I've seldom had very much after that my years with,
with Jim, my early years in America,
of occasional poverty.
You were there at the, at the beginning.
And that's just, you know what I mean?
Like, that's what, that's what fascinates people.
It's not necessarily like,
does this guy know everything about strains?
Does he know everything about breeding?
It's, it's the guys who were there,
the, the, the guys who took the risks
that put their lives on the line
to, to get us from point A to point B.
And those are the guys that we all,
like people of my generation really look up to
because like I'm, I'm from a generation where like,
when I started growing real heavily,
it was during California's Prop 215.
So it was already semi-legal, right?
But I was dealing with other stuff
that wasn't quite so legal
and trying to walk that fine line, you know,
and, and I, I spent countless nights up
wondering if my door was going to get hit
because, you know, the, the plants were too smelly,
you know, during harvest time,
that the harvest time sweats, you know, like,
so I can only imagine during an era
where it's just draconian laws.
I mean, you were coming from England,
risking it all over here
and not knowing what your future would hold
if you got caught.
It's just, it's pretty, pretty inspiring, pretty inspiring.
Well, thank you.
I mean, yeah, I mean, the motive for me was,
of course, was, was the adventure.
I love the, the Southwest, the dry climate
compared to, you know, obviously a damp, wet,
colder climate in England and being out in the,
I was already a bit of a rock climber
and, and back country kind of guy,
and I just loved it.
And, and I, you know, fell in love with this man here.
No, I'm kidding.
We spent a lot of time in the tent together.
Ha ha ha.
Yeah, I bet.
I'm sorry, feeble English jokes.
No, no.
Ha ha ha.
No, he, you know what impressed me
was how organized Jimbo was.
You know, I thought I was coming into these kind of,
I wouldn't know, you know, before I committed,
obviously we, and before he committed to me,
we didn't know one another in, you know,
the winter of 79, we met, I think,
down in Phoenix, wasn't it, Jim, at David's house?
I think so, at David's or, or at,
was Doug living down there then?
No, no.
I don't think so.
He wasn't.
Nope.
It must've been at David's.
But I started to talk to Jim and Doug
for reasons that were left alone.
He wasn't able to work that year.
Yeah.
And so Jim started to talk to me about it,
and I thought, well, what am I getting into?
You know, just kind of, you know,
bunch of spaced out hippies, and it's gonna be dangerous,
but Jim was so organized.
He's kind of a neat freak.
Yeah, yeah, he's very organized.
Much neater than me,
and I know that I, you know,
we were like these two poles apart, you know?
Here's me coming from London from working in the BBC
and a drinking kind of layabout, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
And there's this guy that was into Carlos Castaneda
and much more spiritual and much more healthy.
As I say, he probably saved me from an early death,
you know, if I'd gone back to London,
I would have carried on that, you know,
very unhealthy life.
But Jim was so organized,
and once I saw all that and how together he was,
you know, that's what persuaded me.
You know, if I'd run into this guy
who was utterly stoned all the while,
not to say that we were,
we were opaque in all sorts of things,
and I don't know how much he wants me
to tell you about that.
He had this wonderful little house
in Cottonwood, Arizona, Catclaw,
on the street was called Catclaw,
and it was like this little haven of safety, you know,
because obviously our crop was in the mountains,
you know, in the canyon.
And as soon as I went into his house
and saw how neat and tidy he kept everything
and everything stashed away,
he's infamous in our circles for his little bottles.
In fact, here, I got one right here.
Well, this might not be typical,
but this is something he gave me,
but he's infamous of having all these little tiny bottles
with the various, you know,
drugs in them, mostly.
There you go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's always leaving these little things out.
When you read the book
and when Netflix makes the film out of it,
I'm dreaming.
One hitter.
Oh, nice.
Brand new.
I went in the head shop recently and saw this,
and you open it up and put your buds inside,
and then you pull the match.
Used to call those sneaker tokes.
Didn't you have a pipe that we could toke in bars?
I remember we went to Prescott that evening
for that day for the rodeo.
Fourth of July rodeo, yeah.
Fourth of July rodeo.
Matt, we never saw a cowboy, a cow, a bull, or anything.
We were just in the bars.
And Jim, I remember we went into that,
we drove his car across.
I think there were five or six of us,
and we drove across from Jerome, Arizona.
It's called Great Place it was back then.
And we went over the mountains to Prescott.
It's a big windy, you know, through the glass.
Lingus Mountain. Lingus Mountain, yeah.
And then we went into a country and Western bar
to start the afternoon, you know, to get a drink.
Yeah.
Jim had these M80s, you know what those are?
The fireworks?
Little explosives, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
And he said, Johnny, go around the back
and we'll come in the two doors, you know?
So I thought, what the hell is this?
You know, and I lit the, but I lit it, you know,
and I threw it down by the door and opened the door.
Boom!
Boom!
That was your entrance?
Yeah!
And then just as I came in one side
and all the cowboys, you know, with their hats
and the girl, you know, it was a real country
and Western bar.
And then on the other side, Jim dropped his.
And so all the heads turned to us, you know,
because the place was pretty packed.
Rodeo, July 4th.
And then boom!
The crack goes off the other side
and in come the other two or three guys with Jimbo.
And I wouldn't say we took over the bar,
but you know, we sure made an entrance, yeah.
I can appreciate that.
We were walking down the street on the way there
and we passed it.
You know, people have to park their vehicles
for 10, 15 blocks in all directions.
And they'll come in two days early and park them
and sleep in the back of them
because you can't, there's no place to park.
10, 20,000 people show up.
So we're walking down the street from where we parked
and there was a pickup truck with cases of beer
just piled on each other in the back.
And we looked around and we grabbed, we each, I don't know,
I think we grabbed like two cases
and we just took off down the street.
And when we got to Main Street back there on Whiskey Row,
which it was legal then to walk with alcohol
in the open outside on Whiskey Row,
on this two block section.
We just started handing beers to people
and six packs to people.
And we had so much, it was just funny.
I hope whoever saw that, whoever's truck that is,
it would be really cool if they were watching this.
Yeah, except for your bill.
Right, no, it was the wildest couple of years of my life.
And that's saying something, you know,
and these two years I spent with my partner here, you know.
But yeah, but that's what persuaded me, you know,
the grass and the adventure of it for sure.
Obviously the hope to make some money, you know,
which we certainly did.
You know, we had two years.
The first year we found a wonderful little garden,
not so little maybe.
And we worked like hell to prepare that,
just the two of us that year.
And we dug a lot of holes.
Remember those holes, Jim, that we dug
and then we pulled it off and it was great, you know.
I mean, it was, yeah, the risk was huge.
It was a Mormon county, Christ.
It was, yeah.
We would have been in serious trouble
if we'd been napped, you know.
I always felt in the canyon that, you know,
I didn't say that we were safe
because, you know, there was methods.
You know, they had the infrared cameras,
I believe in those days, you know.
And also, of course, even though we wound the,
you know, the garden through,
we had manzanita, right, Jim?
On one side, those folks.
And pine trees.
And pine trees.
And it was up from the creek, you know.
You could walk by.
One of the things I always remember,
of course, in the autumn, in the fall,
when it was due, was the smell.
You could absolutely smell the weed from the creek, you know.
Yeah, so a guy walking through, if anybody did,
I mean, and Jim says that in four years,
I don't think we saw more than one or two,
one footstep, and that was some hippie hiker
went through there, but very,
wasn't that it was so, you know,
30 miles from a road or anything.
But to get into it, you had to descend
via an enormously exhausting rockfall.
Basalt, it is.
And if you, we tried, we looked for many other ways,
but they were all not only virtually impossible
and exhausting, but dangerous too,
because there'd be cliffs,
and then there'd be a scree slope, right?
And then another cliff,
and you had to wind your way through,
and the soil was loose, you know.
There were times, I remember when we explored,
I don't know if you remember,
there was a chance you could have slipped
and gone over the edge, you know.
Not to mention, I got speared by, you know,
one of those dreadful agaves
that had like a needle on the end.
My leg was swollen for,
because they're slightly poisonous, right, Jim?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Agave, pares, pares, I remember was one,
paras, paras, anyway,
anyway, that was the only way we got,
we dropped in was through, you know,
there was no path, it was just working your way
down these boulders, and when the people came in
to help us, you know, with the harvest
at the end of the year, you know,
they were exhausted.
I bet.
Because they were utterly unused to it.
We were in good shape, and even.
So there wasn't a trail going down,
you actually had to descend boulders and shit.
Exactly.
That's wild.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And boulders and shit.
Exactly.
That's wild, that is wild.
And branches, lots of branches and bushes.
Right.
Crashing through them, and we very carefully
clipped just a few that were in critical spots
where you might have to jump from one boulder
down three feet to a big boulder,
and you know, you couldn't be jumping
into oblivion without seeing it,
so we cut a branch so you could at least see
where you were gonna land.
Right.
I was stepping down with a 30, 40 pound pack,
and I already took the motion to move,
and there was a rattlesnake coiled up
right where I was gonna step,
and I had to throw myself sideways into the bushes,
and my pack just pulled me down and protected me.
It banged against the next boulder,
and you know, we had some interesting little experiences.
None of us ever got bit or anything,
no scorpion bites.
We did have a friend who came down,
who sprained his ankle really bad, Mike,
if you remember, Mike.
Right, I sure do.
And we, I know you do,
because you were tuning a motorcycle with him,
and you had him get on the motorcycle,
your motorcycle, in Phoenix,
and he was on it holding the throttle and revving it,
and you were doing something,
and you said, okay, now do this,
and he popped the clutch.
And I told him not to, yeah, yeah, that was.
And you said the motorcycle shot up into the air,
and he was flying behind it with his body
horizontal to the ground,
and then he let go of the bike,
and it just kept going,
and then he did a full body slam,
boom, down onto the ground.
Oh.
On the road, he was accident prone, that guy.
He definitely was.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
Yeah, Mike's a good guy.
He's still alive.
He lives in North Phoenix.
I saw him last year.
He doesn't remember things well,
so he can't drive anymore.
Oh, well.
But I'll be going to see him in the next few weeks,
along with Robert.
Yep.
All the old times.
Yeah, I never got bitten, no.
Even the scorpions,
I once was convinced there was a snake in my sleeping bag.
I probably had too much smoke that night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, and rattlers, yeah, a lot of rattlesnakes,
a lot of rattlesnakes.
I remember climbing up that wash,
you know, that steep path,
and putting my hand up on something,
and hearing the rattle, you know,
and just jumping back,
like Jim did, threw himself into the bushes.
It's such a shock, you know.
Yeah, you don't mess around with those things,
and you hear that rattle, you jump.
Right.
We have them out here.
Yeah, for sure, in your deserty area.
I think you survive, you know,
I've heard that you can survive a rattlesnake attack.
Yes.
Oh, of course.
Of course you do, mostly, you know.
But they do say that, you know,
it's pretty, pretty,
Oh yeah, it'll mess you up.
Developing for 36, 48 hours,
which would have meant, if we were out there on our own,
which we often were,
Yeah.
You'd have just lied in the shade,
and hoped you had enough water,
because if you start to try to get out,
you send it through your system.
Yep.
I remember Jim gave us the,
Jimbo, you had those little rattlesnake kits, right?
Which had a,
Turned out to be worthless, but at the time.
Yeah.
It was worthless.
Yeah.
That they made you feel safe.
Later, well, they did a little bit,
but they had a,
like a box cutter in them,
that you're supposed to slash at the,
Oh my God.
Yeah, quite that hard.
And then there was something,
like a suction thing that wasn't there,
that you're supposed to pull the,
Suck the venom out?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, those came later,
and they were more accurate,
because they were a empty, big hypodermic,
and when you press down,
they would suck in.
Oh yeah.
So if you applied them within one minute,
And suck the venom out.
Of being bitten,
it would get some venom out of the bite site,
before distributed to your bloods,
unless you got struck on the neck.
Then you're fucked.
Then you're a goner.
Yeah.
Probably.
Probably.
And remember that wash,
we nicknamed it the salt mine.
Yeah.
Because it would make you sweat so much.
It was about,
that was only about 12 or 1300 feet vertical.
Only.
But at the bottom,
and where Doug and I first worked,
it was 1600 feet.
And we,
that's where you and I,
actually went in originally,
to the old garden.
And then we started hiking upstream,
to look for a new garden.
And we were,
we couldn't find anything that met our standards,
for four hours or something like that.
And then we sat down,
to take a break,
and we looked up above,
and we said,
wow, that looks like a little alluvial plateau,
maybe up there.
There it was.
Double E,
I think I have already told Matt,
we called it the Double E,
because if you get the actual topo map of that area,
which I won't disclose,
it fell right under the word,
something creek.
And where the two E's were in creek,
was exactly where the garden was.
That's funny.
That's how we named it the Double E.
That makes sense.
It was a beautiful,
you know,
that's the other thing that,
sort of inspired me as well,
or at least the right,
was how it was a beautiful,
you know,
setting, you know,
this, you know,
those creeks in those desert canyons,
where they've got live water,
whether you have the sycamores,
and not too sure if there's many cottonwoods,
but alders,
you know, anyway,
a riparian growth,
they call it,
you know,
that grows alongside the streams,
of course.
It was just gorgeous down there.
And we had a swimming hole too,
not exactly,
you know,
almost like a swimming pool that opened up,
Jim, didn't it?
After the flood,
I think,
anyway,
there was a place where you,
we could plunge,
you know,
and swim four or five strokes.
So, you know,
in the heat of the summer,
Oh yeah.
Right down there.
Of course we drank straight from the creek all the time,
because upstream,
you know,
we're up towards the little town that we won't mention,
but upstream of us,
it was dry.
So you knew the water was fresh and,
you know,
we just drank straight from the,
And it was safe?
Sure.
Yeah.
It came out below the town.
It didn't flow through the town.
Right.
Otherwise it could be polluted.
When it rained,
of course,
and it was a big summer thunderstorm,
it could wash through it.
If someone had driven across it
and there might be oil in it,
but for it to go miles,
and us actually drink at that moment,
it would be so dilute.
Yeah.
But through the summer,
it was pretty dry for several miles above us.
And, but it somehow,
the water came above surface in our section.
And that's why it was also safe,
because if you stood on the rim of the Canyon in the summer
with all the trees,
you couldn't see water.
Yeah.
There was only one or two spots that we'd see a glint
of water if you walked along the Canyon edge,
which takes hours anyway.
Yeah.
It was quite nice.
And we also realized that fishermen aren't gonna go down
in a hundred degree heat,
1600 feet or whatever,
to go fishing and then have to hike out in the heat
in the afternoon.
No, no.
No.
So Johnny was there during skunk one, right?
The skunk one grow?
Yep.
Do you remember any of the scents
as you could describe them of this skunk one crop
as it was going through flower?
Close up, close up smells,
if you can remember.
Yeah, it was obviously completely different
from the sativa,
which was in my opinion,
a lovely scent.
In fact, Jimbo had a good idea of,
of course we were up against the legality
and illegality of it then,
but to make the sativa into a scent,
what do you call it?
Perfume for-
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know what happened with that,
but the skunk was completely different.
I mean, obviously it was just like,
it wasn't as bad as a roadkill skunk,
but it was very, very, very powerful
and much more sort of,
what's the word?
Acrid almost, much more potent.
Well, potent true,
but more sort of a-
Pungent.
Pungent, there you go.
Yeah, yeah.
It was not as pleasant by any means.
The sativa was beautiful.
I can still remember-
So there was skunk yesterday?
Second.
So there was a skunkiness to it
and the skunk one was some sweetness to it.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Right, Jimbo?
Yeah.
Well, greater after harvest and they were dry
because when you crushed the bud to roll it,
it filled a room.
Yeah.
Easily.
That's wild.
I didn't remember much about how it smelled
while it was growing.
I love the scent of all those flowers,
but it was particularly skunk once it was dry,
and then you're gonna break a bud,
but you didn't even have to break a bud.
If you open a jar of that even in the house,
the whole house would be skunk.
But the sativa, to get back to it,
the mad jag as I was sort of,
the mad jag was the sativa strain
and those blooms, you could pull them down,
obviously in the autumn,
and just brush them a little bit.
Oh my God, it was delightful.
It was just great.
And you really didn't need to brush them that much.
As I say, I mean, you could,
if the wind was right when you was crossing the creek
or just walking around,
our camp was hidden on the far side
from the garden, from the alluvial plain,
and you could absolutely smell it.
And it's a big thing.
I won't go on too much about my book,
but it was a big thing in the close scrapes
that I wrote about in the novel
with how we nearly got caught because of the smell.
And I remember when we came out,
when the year that Sammy helped us, Jim,
this was this wonderful, crazy guy
that helped us with the work, the Swiss guy.
We had that camper that I got, remember?
And we put all the boxes on the bunk, over the cab.
You remember that, that setup?
And Sammy and I drove it out.
And we went to, we came around the,
anyway, long story,
but we wanted to have breakfast or lunch or whatever it was.
We were driving out, you know?
And of course, inside the camper, the smell was overpowering.
But even outside, you could smell it.
And there was a scene,
we went into the cafe to get some,
you know, to have a meal in this little town.
And the sheriff, the deputy sheriff's truck
kept pulled alongside the camper.
It was like a four-wheel drive,
you know, with a camper rig on top.
Yeah.
And I'm looking through the window and I go,
I don't know if I'm allowed to use foul language here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're okay.
Yeah.
You know, this is dodgy to put it mildly, you know?
Yeah.
Half the, I don't know about half the crop,
but boxes and boxes of wheat,
enough to put you in a-
Away, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, get you put away.
And I was terrified that the sheriff would,
probably some teetotaling Mormon.
Oh, for sure, some backwoods teetotaling Mormon.
Yeah, you know, you go, what the hell's that smell?
You know, anyway, suffice to say that,
I think I've got a fairly good scene in the book
that sort of mirrors that, you know?
Let's talk about your book real quick.
What's it called?
It's called The Year of the Mad Jag.
Oh, right, Year of the Mad Jag.
And do you have a website or a place
where you can get people to buy it?
I do, I do.
Should I send you the link at the end?
You can say it right here
and then I'll add it in at the end too.
Well, it's jonathanslator.com, my full name,
Jonathan Slator, S-L-A-T-O-R.
And maybe I can send you the link directly to it
at the end and you can chuck it on the screen
when you edit, yeah?
Absolutely.
Yeah, it's won two little awards.
It's the best one being
the William Faulkner Creative Writing Competition.
That's crazy.
In New Orleans, yeah, I went to New Orleans
and it's taken a time, of course, here we are,
Jesus, 40 years later,
but I wrote it in the 2000s.
It took me that, I was actually living in New Zealand
and wrote a version that was worthless.
So I wrote it again when I had some time,
when my children were taking care of themselves
a bit more anyway, when I was,
I live up here in Taos, New Mexico.
Yeah.
And anyway, so, and I tried to get
a traditional publisher, an agent and the whole deal.
But there's so, so very few of those now,
especially for new unknown writers.
Yeah.
Everything's, the whole publishing thing
is just like the film business.
I've worked in the film business.
It's all marketing, how you market yourself,
how much money you have to market yourself, everything.
Yeah, it's all that.
I guess my point was that it's all in turmoil.
It changes every week, almost every year.
Nobody really knows what's gonna happen next.
The whole shift to Kindles and the digital and audio books.
So anyway, the point of all that being that
as I sort of tried to get many times,
I sent it to 60, 70 agents and publishers
and got sick and tired of the rejection.
So I almost gave up on it.
Yeah.
But I decided recently,
I actually a production designer on a film
I was working on Reddit a couple of years ago
and he said, this is great, you gotta get it out.
I'm trying not to slap my own back too much,
but it's a good story.
Yeah.
I'm obviously biased, but thanks to that man
sitting on the top of the screen there.
Yeah, I mean, it was,
somebody once told me I should write a memoir
and I said, no, that wouldn't be interesting,
because for all the risk that we took,
there was nothing that thrilling happened.
We weren't chased by the law or...
Yeah, yeah.
We were pretty organized and we kept it...
No gunfights, no nothing, yeah.
Right.
And Jim is very thorough bloke.
And I remember I've watched a little bit
of your previous one and talking about
scattering the leaves in the morning.
Exactly.
We would always, we call it a watering moon.
The early phase of the moon
was always the one you wanted to be watering in,
because in the summer we would take turns.
We didn't both need to go in,
especially the first year when we only had the one garden.
Second year, it was more work,
but one guy could do it, it was hard work.
Sure.
You get that pump going and the Briggs and Stratton,
and it was roaring,
and you spent the next four hours blundering around
trying to keep the hoses from spilling over.
We had a little terrace system,
with little walls like a rice paddy in Southeast Asia.
Anyway, the point of all that was that,
it was great to have the moon waxing,
come over the canyon rim.
We were in a nice East-West part that we chose it,
so that we'd have maximum sun, right?
But of course, it helped also for maximum moonlight.
And so, the watering was one guy.
And that was always, of course, a risk as well.
You're on your own down there.
Anything could happen, you get stung by a scorpion,
you just twist your ankle,
and you probably couldn't get out for two or three days.
I mean, you wouldn't have died, hopefully,
from a twisted ankle, but you would have been...
I remember you did a terrible twist yourself once,
Jimbo, too.
I remember you were struggling to get out because of that.
Anyway, it was a great adventure, that's for sure.
And again, it was so beautiful.
And one of the things I remember later on as well
was having the water,
because of the continued growth
and the drought in the Southwest.
Jim, you maybe know more about this than I,
because I went to New Mexico and you, of course, stayed.
But the...
Ha, there's the skunk.
The creek was so depleted that guys who went in
and used our setup the next couple of years
could barely...
Oh, there we are.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
That's funny.
This was us in 1980, roughly,
and my daughter, who's 48 years old right now.
That's amazing.
You guys are in good shape.
Look at that.
We were in super shape.
Look at Jim.
Hey, you didn't go...
You go in and out of that canyon, man, every week.
You were hard, as they say.
Yeah, you could do some...
You guys could have been doing some MMA
or ultimate fighting back then with that kind of shape
and climbing rocks and shit.
God.
Yeah, yeah.
So a question I do have for you.
You know, Jim, even just since I've met him
and slowly become friends and learned from him,
I've had a lot of synchronicities in my life,
just weird little occurrences, like weird.
Things just keep falling in place with different people
just that never really happened,
would never really fall together.
Did he influence your life spiritually or anything at all?
You know, absolutely.
I'm not a particularly...
I was coming from this cynical, skeptical world
of an urban environment, London.
UK is very, very atheist.
Like I've noticed that, like watching the TV program.
It's common to be atheist there,
whereas in the US it's not, you know?
Yeah, no, I am still very much an atheist.
Sames, oh my, yeah.
I don't think that, frankly,
religion has done more good than harm in the world.
I'd argue we could debate that for a long while.
I think what Jim reminded,
and the experience reminded me of,
was I'd left home at 18 to go to the cities, you know?
I was a farm boy.
And it brought back to me, and again, this is in the book,
the value, if you will, of wilderness.
And I've become more of an animist because of that.
You know, I don't follow the...
I don't even, frankly, have a lot of time
for the Eastern religions that have come into...
And Jim gave me some of that, I would say.
But not in any kind of a conventional way do I think.
I think a lot of the popularity of the Western religions,
Buddhism and Hinduism and everything,
and Jim and I may disagree on this,
but I think it's very superficial in so many ways.
Especially in your state, I would argue, California.
There's a lot of art of bollocks, pardon me.
I mean, Beverly Hills Buddhists are kind of, yeah.
You know, it's just, they just grab the cool side of it,
oh, it's peaceful.
I mean, there's nothing wrong with meditating.
That's a great thing to do.
But you don't study also the four noble truths
and samsara and, you know, I tried it.
I meditated up here and did the slow walking and everything
and tried to get into it
as I got older looking for some answers.
But in answer to your question,
I think that my spirituality lies in the natural world.
This perhaps isn't very original, but you know,
that's my, and those two years in that canyon
absolutely built that into me much more.
It took me back to my years growing up on a farm,
but also the feeling that if there is any power out there,
it comes in the natural world, trees, the creek,
the stones even, you know, that's what I believe.
It's maybe a little-
Fascinating, because like, you know,
through my own journey in life,
I've gone from so much as like someone
who was really into Satanism.
So I started off Catholic.
So of course, as a young punk rock kid that's like 12, 13,
I immediately get into Satanism
because it's like the complete opposite, right?
Like just what is the opposite of what my parents like?
Is it what can make my parents mad, right?
Right.
But after a while I got, you know, of course,
as I got older and into science and botany,
I got more into atheism and logic and reasoning.
And over time, I've just kind of, especially with plants,
learning from plants, being around plants so long,
I've come to realize,
and I don't know how much it makes sense
because I've never really got,
I've never really vibed with like the whole hippie,
like mother earth type thing.
But I think that's probably closest
to what I believe now as an adult,
that there's a lot more conscious on this earth
than we have any clue,
just because it doesn't have a brain
doesn't necessarily mean it can't communicate
and communication is key,
like to all living beings in life.
And I've just kind of come to a similar conclusion in that,
if there is something existing,
it's probably very natural and been here among us
as in the plants, the actual earth.
And that's where a lot of this energy
is probably coming from, as best I can tell,
as a human who can't have any answers,
it seems to make the most sense to me
after interacting with all these plants
and how much they've changed my life for the better.
Sure, no, no, I agree more.
And to me, there's a great deal more logic
in the life force, if you will,
coming from this natural world
that's been going for what?
What's the big bang, 13 billion years or something.
Yeah, yeah.
A lot more sense than that.
Than believing that somebody walked out of a mountain
with some tablets with some rules on them.
You know, I mean, to me, that's just nonsense.
Yeah, very human created.
Yeah.
And there was 15 besides and still missing.
Oh, that's right, huh?
Well, what do they say?
Who is it says if God had an existed man
would have invented it, right?
Yeah, right.
I mean.
I mean, it's obviously.
You know, when were you born, Matt?
What's your era?
How old are you?
1981.
So at the end of 1981, I'm 41.
Oh, wow, okay.
Yeah.
We're both 70.
Are you 72 now, Jim?
Two weeks.
Two weeks.
Oh, that's right.
When's your birthday, Jim?
13th.
13th, yeah, I didn't know that.
You got the old man to cough it up.
Yeah.
Well, you know, also, when you sleep next to a creek
and hear it in the sound at night in the wilderness
and the stars were as bright as you can ever imagine,
you'd have to go very few places in America today
to be away from city lights.
And the town that was near us was hundreds of people.
So there was no light for many, many, many miles.
Right.
Tens and tens and 20s of miles.
And listening to the sound of a creek flowing by
for a year or two, the time that you go every week,
it's just so healing.
It's a healing thing.
My book starts with a poem
that was translated by Gary Snyder.
You know that name, the poet?
Anyway, I walk for thousands of years.
Anyway, it's a long story, but it ends up,
I'll sleep by the creek and purify my ears.
That's from the cold mountain poems
of the, I think, eighth century recluse.
Hanshan.
Hanshan, yeah.
That's how I opened the book.
So that was what got us, you know,
to get back to your thoughts about the experience
and everything.
It was so lovely being down there.
And I never felt like,
even if they had discovered us down there,
the chances of them, you know,
and I discussed it, you know,
that they would probably wait for us to hike out
with something that they could get.
You know, they wouldn't stake out the garden because-
They wouldn't travel down there just to get you
when they know you're gonna come back out.
Exactly.
And, you know, and would they,
and if we were down there and we had at least,
you know, a chance,
we could get away from those guys probably, you know?
Yeah, and they don't know what you have down there
as far as, it could have been, you know,
cartel with weapons.
Not just a cartel, but you know what I mean?
People with weapons, anything.
So yeah, they would definitely wait for you guys
to come out loading packs.
Right, well, in the nearby canyon, Jim,
there was a cartel that went to work there, didn't they?
And they all were packing heat, weren't they?
It's just that that was much longer after us.
I mean, that was in recent years, in the 2000s.
Oh, was it as late as that?
Yeah.
But also we had day packs,
that today people call bug out bags.
Or for me, it was like,
I think my nickname was a parachute.
So if we knew people were coming down into the canyon,
were above us or something crazy,
we could go down our canyon,
which led to another canyon,
which led to another canyon.
And we could, it could take a day or two,
but we could disappear and never be found.
Because we didn't park a car ever
for those two years out there.
Maybe the first year a little bit,
but the second year we had people drop us off
and pick us up every week,
because it was too risky.
Because like I mentioned earlier,
the guys in the canyon next to us,
they parked a truck week after week there.
And eventually the rancher called the forest service.
They checked the plates and what do you know?
They're from Jerome, which was the hippie capital.
So they just waited until they came out
and took everything home to Jerome.
And showed up at their house and got them.
So one question.
Oh, go ahead.
Well, I was going to say that was another thing that,
you know, we were, for want of a better term,
we were pretty rigorous about it.
We were professional about it.
And mostly because Jim insisted,
I'd say, hey, we can drive the hell out of there.
Not always, but you know,
that we would have a few back and forths
because who wants to hike another three miles, you know?
So when we did leave cars,
we would leave them a long way away, you know?
And make that extra effort to get in there, you know?
And then as Jim says, the second year when we really had,
we doubled our yield, I think, or doubled our size.
Because we took another,
we made another garden the second year.
But anyway, sorry, you were going to ask something, Matt.
So one thing that I know people are going to want me to ask
before we finish up,
and it, someone asked if you guys ever saw UFOs
in the sky out there in those clear, clear nights?
Well, no, I didn't.
You didn't, okay.
Jim's got some other stories that he might tell.
I do remember the satellites
that were mostly north to south back then,
and that's 40 odd years ago.
And we were, the music, we were, right, mate?
We were kind of intrigued by what the hell they were.
And-
Until you realize their patterns?
Yeah, yeah.
And they also wink in and out with the sun.
They are only, they're reflecting the sun
that's gone down behind the horizon, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
Right, you know?
And of course there's thousands of them now, right?
I mean, Elon Musk has got a thousand of them.
Yeah, tons.
So in those days, they were much, much less well-known.
And so when we, I can remember first seeing them
and thinking, well, what the hell is that?
You know?
Have you guys seen the Starlink train yet?
The what, mate?
Starlink train, Elon Musk's.
There was one morning I was driving somewhere.
It was like 5 a.m.
and it was pitch black outside, driving in my car,
and I look up and there was a stream of lights,
like dots, going across the whole sky.
Wow.
And I stopped in my car,
got out in the middle of the street.
There's other people stopping their car,
getting out in the middle of the street.
It's the first time that anybody's seen Starlink train yet.
And everybody's thinking this is a big, huge, massive UFO
because it is just going across the whole sky.
Yeah, it turned out.
Wow, I have not seen that.
But it's crazy when you see it.
It's crazy.
They're geosynchronous and there's over 1,500 now.
So how far apart would they need to go
around the circumference of the Earth
would that make them?
It was, I mean, it was,
it stretched across at least half the sky.
Wow.
And there were probably eight or nine dots
throughout that half of the sky.
We saw great meteorites that night.
Sure.
And once I was hiking out to the canyon
and I got to the edge of the canyon,
near sunset, you know, in the late afternoon.
And I heard this sound and I looked down
and coming up the canyon was a jet,
an Air Force jet, hundreds of feet below the rim.
I mean, he was at treetop,
but he was flying up the canyon.
And I just stood there and the sonic boom was massive.
And at the end of the canyon,
he just gunned it and shot straight up and out.
And I was like, wow.
So they were doing training, I believe, you know,
because the Russians were invading Afghanistan
around that period.
79?
Perfect place to fly around like Afghanistan.
Yeah, they were doing lots of desert training.
Yeah.
Flying.
Luckily they weren't practicing parachuting.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, do you know the definition of using a parachute now?
Do you know what that definition is?
Yeah, yeah.
So Jim's parachute to get out
might mean a little different now.
Ha ha.
You ever done a parachute jump?
No, I haven't.
I haven't yet.
No.
Oh, Lord.
I did a lot of it.
You did one?
In Australia, yeah.
Living down there, I did one, yeah.
That's another story.
How long did you live in Australia?
A year in Australia and a year in New Zealand each.
And then another year in South America
and then some time in Southeast Asia.
After-
Was that all for the BBC?
Sorry, mate?
Was that all for the BBC?
No, no, that was, no, it was afterwards.
After Jim and I had our adventure,
I came to live in Taos.
I built a house up here, I sold it.
And then I sailed across the Pacific.
Wow.
What a life.
Yeah, kind of.
What a life.
I mean, that's my dream, man,
sailing and just getting out, just doing it.
Yeah, well, there's a friend of mine
just sailed from Cabo St. Lucas to Tahiti.
That's hard work, though.
Blue water sailing, the islands are the great thing.
The sailing's fun, but it's exhausting, too.
You never sleep properly.
And on a small boat.
We had a 57-foot catch, I think, that we were on.
And you're just crewing all the time, working.
You get a few hours kip, as they say, where I come from,
and then somebody bashes on the hatch
for you to come and help reef the sails.
Anyway, but it was a great adventure,
wonderful adventure, all the way down through Tahiti
and Tonga and Rarotonga,
all the Cook Islands, they're called.
But yeah, I lived down in New Zealand and Australia
and just wandered around,
and found work in the films while I was there.
Worked on a film in Buenos Aires when I was over that way.
Wow.
Remember the Highlander series?
Yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah, we did the second one down there.
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah, in Buenos Aires, great city, lovely, lovely town.
People are loyal to the Highlander series.
Yeah.
Yeah, a friend of mine, one of my guys,
I'm a location manager, you know,
and so I have a crew, obviously.
I work here in New Mexico, I'm still working.
I'm doing a thing for, it's one of their films, yeah.
Anyway.
Why don't they want to do a Mad Jag film?
That's the real ticket.
They're getting a book.
Those boys, I know the assistants.
I'm going to give them a book.
I mean, that's the story.
I think of all the stories I've seen on the history
of the genesis of this scene, of the cannabis scene.
And since I've had Mad Jag on these,
these have been the most popular shows we've ever done,
like by a large portion.
So I know that at least our,
and this is a niche type thing to be this far
into genetics and breeding and strains,
but we have a pretty good size audience for that.
And man, the amount that they've tuned
into just this story tells me that like,
that's something that people
at Netflix should probably take interest in personally.
Like I know I would be super into seeing that, you know?
Yeah.
You know, obviously that's my hope as well.
You know, I just would like to get the story out there
before I'm too bloody old, you know,
and can't do much more, but yeah.
And I think obviously there's a certain,
obviously with the way it's suddenly in a sense
could become legalized, at least since Colorado.
Colorado was the first, I think, right?
California and then Colorado.
Or was it?
No, no, and maybe Colorado went fully legal first.
I thought it was Colorado.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I think they went fully legal first, yeah.
They were 10 years ago now, yeah.
Yeah.
So with the, you know, I mean, in a sense,
and this is what I say, you know,
when Jim and I were doing it and back in those days,
obviously, you know, I come from a pretty straight family,
you know, farming stock and my brothers and sisters
who are teachers and business folk, you know,
even now they're appalled that I did something
so radical and dangerous.
Isn't that awesome though?
Definitely.
What's that?
Isn't that awesome though?
Like to be the one person in your family
who's like the black sheep who does the awesome shit?
I was always the black sheep, you know?
Yeah, same here.
Yeah.
Even now they would, just a drug dealer, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, and yet that's what I love
about this legalization that we have.
In a sense, we were vindicated.
We were, I call it, we were modern day moonshiners,
you know, we were doing just what the guys still do
in Kentucky and places, I guess.
Absolutely.
You know, and yeah, that's, I would like to think
that story, and there are a few marijuana stories out there
or smuggling stories, you know, there's the, well, blow,
you know, what is it?
Oh yeah.
You get one, you know?
He just recently passed, rest in peace, Boston George, yeah.
Did he really?
Yeah, unfortunately.
And that's cocaine, which in my view is a stupid drug.
He started on cannabis in Manhattan Beach
as a cannabis dealer, yeah.
No, I mean, cocaine in my view
is an absolutely ridiculous drug.
Oh yeah.
No, you know.
Ego drug.
What, mate?
Ego drug.
Yeah, there you go.
You feel like God for 20 minutes,
and then you need another.
No, it's a stupid drug.
But marijuana is, I don't know, I won't go on too much,
but I think it's, you know, Colorado
and all the other states have proven
that the system didn't collapse.
Not everybody's scratching into each other on the freeway.
Christ, I remember driving stoned, you know, you doing 25.
Yeah, 25 in a 50.
You know, ripping the wheel.
Yeah, you drive extra safe.
Extra safe, you know, you're so bloody careful, you know.
So, you know, and how many people,
how many alcoholics, these are all cliches,
but I've seen so many alcoholics in my time.
And no, it's proven that it's essentially harmless.
But on that note, I would also say,
and stop me if I'm talking too much,
but on that note is that we shouldn't think of it
as the panacea, you know,
when we do need to be careful of it,
because the way you guys, you know,
the way the modern growers are doing it,
what do we have, Jim?
What percentage THC did we have in the buds?
Eight to 12, roughly, if you're lucky.
Right, and what's it now?
Some say up to 35, 36, 40, somewhere in there.
Four times as powerful, you know.
And that's just the weed, not even the extract.
Extracts are at 90 now, 99, you know.
Exactly, and somebody taking that for the first time
and getting behind the wheel or-
Yeah, that would really, really screw someone up.
That's bloody dangerous, you know.
And I think there are certain also mental issues
with it as well, you know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Some people can't quite handle it, you know.
There were a lot of years where I could not smoke
without it triggering anxiety, depression,
anything like that.
And it was just one of those things I had to get used to
as far as, like, come to the conclusion,
like, my hormones in my body change as I get older.
I can't smoke like I used to,
like, at least during those years.
It's changed again for whatever reason.
I can smoke nonstop and not have that.
But during those years,
it was really, really triggering stuff,
and it was not a good time for me to be using it.
Only triggered it made it worse.
So, yeah, it's definitely not the cure-all.
I see CBD stores everywhere in California now.
Not just everywhere.
I mean, in gas stations, they're selling CBD oil.
They're selling CBD joints, you know, CBD everything.
Delta 8, Delta 10, specifically,
which are extracted from hemp.
And a lot of people don't know that.
The other day, I was in a cigarette store,
and I about, because I get pretty autistic with this stuff.
Like, when I hear misinformation,
it makes my face turn red,
especially if it's something I'm very passionate about.
And this lady was, I was waiting to get vape stuff, right?
At the vape, it was a vape cigarette store,
and they sell cigarettes and CBD and everything there.
And I was listening to this lady.
She was trying to get real advice,
real medical advice from a cigarette store guy, right?
On what she should be using.
He's like, well, you know, Delta 8, Delta 9, Delta 10,
they're all made from sativas, so you're pretty safe there.
And I was just like,
mm, mm, mm, mm, why?
Why are you just making it up?
Why are you telling this lady medical advice, you know?
Sativa might mean one thing to her,
and whatever she's taking
might completely trigger the opposite effect.
And it could be a really bad, bad situation, experience.
She may never try cannabis again, you know?
It may be such a negative experience.
And then it's all because someone gave her bad info,
you know, and that ruins it for her for good.
So yeah, it's just constant around here.
And a lot of it, they're selling Chinese-sourced CBD.
And a lot of people don't know
the Chinese government was paying their people
to grow hemp in mass
to leach toxins from the soil in China.
So a lot of these hemp plants
were grown to leach toxins from the soil,
and they're using that, sending it over here in mass
to use for CBD market for extraction.
Now, I don't know that those metals make it in.
I don't know,
but that's not what people think they're getting.
They don't understand that.
And it's 99% of the CBD stuff in gas stations
is that Chinese-sourced CBD, you know?
Right. So yeah.
Well, it's done.
And again, I would say that, you know,
to get back to the sort of increased strength of it now.
Sure.
And, you know, I don't think
that impressionable teenagers should be, you know,
taking too much of this or, you know, maybe, you know.
I think they're pretty well proven.
It affects undeveloped brains.
Right.
And can cause, what is it called?
Emotional arrest.
Meaning like a lot of people that start smoking
when they're 12,
emotionally tend to stay around that age, emotionally.
You know, that tends to happen.
And it's not always, it's not everyone.
So it's not like a blanket statement, but it can happen.
And so, yeah, like that was one of my things growing up.
I had a younger, I have two younger brothers.
And I was very cognizant
that one of my brothers was already smoking pot,
and I didn't want him to think
that I was an advocate necessarily of it,
knowing what I did.
So I'd hide what I did for a living for a long time from him.
And, you know, as he got older, he thought,
yeah, you're an idiot.
Like, why would you do that?
Like, I was already smoking,
but at the same time, I didn't want him to think
that I was telling him that this is what he should be doing,
that I think this is cool because I didn't.
And he's, you know, I mean, I'm sure he's felt effects
from it as he's gotten older.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm still a 12 year old.
So.
Same with booze, you know, same with whether you agree
that booze should be restricted to 21 or 18 or something.
I mean, it's the same in a sense,
you should be mature before you make that decision.
And I think there's a lot of, you know,
jumping on the bandwagon now about weed and CBD.
And I think we need to be cautious as well,
because it is a strong drug, no doubt about it.
When I first tried some of these edibles,
you know, it clearly too much.
I was sprawled out for six hours.
Drooling?
Yeah.
Was that drooling?
Yeah, they've made me drool.
They've made me drool before.
I had a great share of marijuana in the day, you know,
and yeah, yeah, yeah.
So we got to be careful, that's all I think, you know.
You know, they sell this stuff for dogs too,
like the CBD oil.
And it reminds me of when me and my chick met,
she wasn't smoking anymore.
She smoked a lot when she was young,
but she hadn't smoked for years.
And I was like, you know, my friend sent me some CBD oil,
she had some back pain.
I was like, let's try this.
But she hadn't had any THC in years.
Then there was a negligible amount of THC
in some of these CBD extracts.
And people don't realize that,
because it's not done very carefully with some sellers.
And she took it and she went to hell
for at least like, you know, 12 hours.
She was in THC hell, you know.
And it was a negligible amount,
but it's just because it affected her so much,
she's not used to it.
And all of a sudden, bam, she's taking an extracted amount,
even though it was small, it's extracted.
So, you know, yeah, that can happen.
Giving this to their dogs,
people are giving this to their kids,
and they have no clue, no clue that that can happen.
Hey, they're mixing LSD with weed, you know that, right?
How are they doing that?
I was like, wait a minute, you can't smoke that.
I remember your story now.
Well, in the 1980s,
there was a number of people who still believe that.
Oh, I bet.
And they first smoked weed that was kind of psychedelic.
And one of my Mad Jag Chronicles
is about a Rastafarian I know in Brooklyn.
And he sent us out of his house
after he had two puffs of skunk number one.
And the next day told me,
was very mad that I had given him some LSD.
And he had never smoked anything that powerful.
He was a super Rastafarian.
When we were gone,
he told us later that he jogged in place for 20 minutes.
He had so much energy, he didn't know what to do.
So he just ran in place in his living room.
That's great.
I bet there's still some people out in the farm somewhere
that believe there's LSD could be good.
Oh yeah, I mean, look at the fentanyl craze lately.
I mean, you see this with the police officer
saying that they're absorbing fentanyl
through their fingers from powder
and like passing out everywhere.
People that know you can't absorb fentanyl
through your fingers unless it's got
some kind of transdurable gel, DMSO,
it doesn't absorb that way.
Yeah, and even being a foot away
and inhaling a microscopic amount of powder of fentanyl
isn't gonna kill you or nor need Narcan.
So we see this today with the,
and granted fentanyl is dangerous as hell.
There's no doubt about it.
I mean, people shouldn't be taking this stuff.
It's unregulated.
It's coming from China.
Don't take it, please people.
Not saying you should take it,
but it's also the,
it's like the satanic panic of the 80s to me
where there are so much misinformation
is coming out with these drugs
that people are experiencing these psychosomatic effects
and it helps spread more fear.
Now the cops are passing out.
They're so terrified to work with fentanyl
and do these fentanyl arrests.
They're passing out in fear
and blaming it on overdosing and all this crazy shit.
And it's causing more fear.
And it's just, yeah, fear of the unknown
is something that always-
The crack epidemics.
Exactly.
Similar, yeah.
Yeah, definitely, definitely.
So did you guys ever think you would be pioneering
an industry that became a multi-billion dollar industry?
That's what I wanna know.
Did you ever once think that you were pioneering
changing anything?
Oh, no.
We were just filling a need in a way.
There's a guy who now lives in Costa Rica,
but he lived up here in Taos for many years.
And he started to talk to me, Jim knows the story.
And he said, yeah, we just sort of got under weed.
And he said, I lived in, I think it was Wisconsin.
And he said, I drove down to Arizona once
and fetched this weed that somebody was selling.
God, it was the best you'd ever had.
And I said, oh yeah, what was it called?
And he said, oh, it was the Mad Jag.
These guys with the labels.
And we got it back to Chicago
and it was gone in a few hours.
Anyway, so we were just, we would moonshine this.
We were providing an illicit product
for a market that demanded it, right?
And we were in the early days,
again, we talked about it earlier.
So it was the methods that Jim had learned
and taught me, I mean, what did I know?
And how to pull the mails,
how to get your product superb.
We were very careful and especially obviously
of those three or four days,
and we had to dry it down in the canyon,
and we didn't have a cellar or a barn or something.
So we strung lots of lines into the most shady parts
of the creek side trees that we could find.
And we took great pride in our product, if you will.
And Jim sent something into the High Times.
He sent some buds into High Times.
Jim, on that other site that you recommended
that I put your book up, I See Mag,
you know of that one, Matt, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, there was a little conversation.
I'll send you the link if you're interested.
The first, there's a chapter of the book up on that one,
on I See Mag.
And I don't know, is that your competition?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, definitely.
Check it out.
Anyway, you know, we got a great write-up.
Somebody dug up, the guy was saying skunk.
That wasn't, you know, nobody had heard of skunk
until the 90s or something.
He was trying, and I said, well, no.
We had it back in 1980.
Anyway, you know, we were, no, did we think, of course,
it wasn't gonna grow into this industry that it is now?
You know, obviously we didn't know
it was gonna be legal ever, right?
Yeah, sure.
But I mean, just to maybe close it up,
I don't know, Jim, what Jim would say,
but it was, there were a couple things.
It was the adventure, yeah.
It was the, what's the word,
tipping your nose at authority.
Yeah, yeah.
That was part of it, you know,
and the excellent seed that we had
that grew this marvelous, the skunk was one thing.
I've never been that fond of that, you know.
I like this, that sativa was so energizing, you know,
and as I say, we'd smoke it in the morning.
I'd go, what?
You know, we'll just be lying around, wasting a day.
But no, you could get out.
I mean, I don't know if you could fully operate in a job.
I said, smoke marijuana and be any good on a film set,
but I could certainly, you know,
run around and chase a football or play tennis.
I remember when I lived in LA,
we would go playing paddle tennis.
Anyway, you would have a puff.
Yeah, I do all these sober myself.
I can't, I can never do an interview stoned,
not even a little bit.
No.
My memory call sucks during any time
when I'm even a little bit stoned.
So I've done every single one of these completely sober.
It's weird.
Me too.
I have too.
Oh really?
Oh yeah, I'm totally.
Yeah, no, it has that dissociative quality to it
that is the word I always, you know,
it's perfect for, yeah, hiking or making love.
Yeah, right?
Yeah.
There are things that it's good for
and there are things that it's lousy for, you know,
and I don't know.
Working outside in the garden is a pleasure.
Working outside in the garden, yeah.
You know, doing sort of physical things,
but holding a conversation about Proust or, you know,
you're not gonna hold it up unless, you know,
in fact, I remember recording in my mind,
conversations that I had when I was in Jerome with people
and, you know, a lot of them were just very digressive,
very, you know, you don't stay on track so well.
Yeah.
It's the same as a lot of drugs, you know,
you should take them recreationally and enjoy it for that.
You know, just like being in the pub
and drinking three or four pints.
By the end, you're full of life and joking
and the next morning you feel like shit.
Yeah, exactly.
Marijuana doesn't seem to have quite the same hangover.
No, not for me.
There's nothing like it once you're used to it, yeah.
No, especially not once you're used to it.
I remember early on feeling like I was dragging a bit
the next day, but that went away so fast.
Right. So fast.
Well, edibles.
Yeah, well, that's a different story.
I've had that lag days upon.
Some of the Malawi cobs I've made and other people,
the next day you wake up and you're still as high
as you were the day before.
Yeah, that cob you gave me, holy shit.
He says, take a bees, bee size or something.
This is only about five or six years ago
and I was on my way up somewhere to work
and I think I stopped in Durango night
and talk about being absolutely blitzed for the evening,
barely able to order a meal,
let alone hold a conversation.
That's funny.
I don't think you've ever had a cob.
And then stoned as a dog the next morning too.
You know, driving through the mountains
and going, I am stoned.
12 hours later.
No, that's not it.
At least it wasn't in downtown LA.
Yeah.
Yeah, imagine being on the freeway or something,
you know, at 80 miles an hour.
God, no, thank you.
Or in LA, 10 miles.
Well, is there anything else you want to get in, Jim?
Specifically?
Not really.
Johnny's covered a good portion.
And like he was saying, if you go to that other website,
the other-
I'll put up those links.
I went over last week and posted a copy
of the Robert Clark's handwritten envelope
that the seeds came in.
Oh, wow.
So that he could see that, you know,
he put for the 1981 season.
Yeah, yeah.
Made in 1980, that one, you know.
And I posted some thoughts about that also
was that it was odd that they used the front of the label
said, you know, hash plant.
Yeah, pure Afghan.
It said repeatedly on that label, pure Afghan, unhybridized.
It made me wonder if maybe they started with Afghan
number one and it was before skunk number one,
or they were planning on releasing these labels
with skunk number, I mean, with Afghan number one,
but people said, oh no, the skunk number one
is way better, way better.
So then they switched and he sold skunk number one.
I think they had those labels printed up
and then they realized, oh my God, we have multiple strains,
but we have these nice labels.
Let's just use the label and put the Afghan on the back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And also there's so much detail that we both know
from like even the Jerome days when we were growing
and we were so, our first year we did quite well,
good enough so that we didn't have to work for $2 an hour,
which we did the year before just to get by.
Yeah.
And it also allowed me the money to buy 3000 skunk
number one seeds.
Exactly.
I have to say thank you to high times
because that's how I found Robert Clark.
Great reading some of his articles in there.
Yeah.
I wrote to him via high times.
They said, if you want to talk to the author or whatever,
and then he wrote me directly or somehow we connected.
And it was, I realized then that by having the most potent,
most famous seed at that time, it would be up to our benefit.
Oh yeah.
It brought skunk to Arizona yet,
not alone to New York city or Brooklyn.
And it turned out to be very worthwhile.
It was so new at that point.
It was skunk was so new when you guys got hold of it,
you guys were some of the biggest first guys growing
in that size for sure.
Yeah.
And we pulled it off.
So that made it even better.
And made history.
All right, guys.
This is an amazing conversation.
Is there anything else you want to get in Johnny?
Just looking back, Jim and I are still,
we went periods when I went my way and he went his,
but it's been, it was the adventure of my life.
Absolutely.
It was, and if I may have had a few,
and that was a fabulous time.
And I'm always grateful to Jim for sort of mentoring me
through it, because so many people,
thousands, obviously tens of thousands of people
have grown weed since, in dodgy spots.
And a lot of them fail.
I mean, I bet there's a tremendous attrition rate
of failure.
Everybody starts out all full of enthusiasm
and goes out and cuts holes into manzanita,
thickets and they don't make it.
So I wanted to just thank that,
Jim was the man.
And I really, for the first year anyway,
I was just the working stiff,
but it was a fabulous adventure and I'll never regret it.
No, I mean, and again, we've sort of covered it,
but it's nice to have this vindication now,
all these years later, that marijuana hasn't,
most of the Republican senators in Colorado,
they'll all be the death of Colorado
and everybody's gonna be smashing into each other
and sprawling out on the streets.
And the other thing I'd like to point out,
which is something that gets me very strongly,
I'm an American citizen now,
but this prison system that we have in this country is,
pardon me, it's a fucking disaster in my view.
And the number of people that are languishing in jail
for God knows how long,
for sitting on the porch and smoking a reefer in the evening
like anybody else has a glass of scotch or a beer,
is absolutely, and it's an indictment
of the privatized prison system we have in this country,
which is an absolute travesty of justice.
It's right there with slavery to me,
privatized prison systems, it is slavery.
And all the corporations, these ugly corporations
that set up these awful prisons,
and like Jim's got a lovely place up in Northern New Mexico
that I've visited in a lot,
and right, there's a little town called Clayton close by,
and it's classic of what,
sorry, I don't wanna go into too much about this,
but you asked me.
And this system where we, the taxpayer,
pay these corporations to put people in jail,
and they build them in these shitty rundown little towns,
like this one's Clayton, where there's no business,
no, it's a dying town,
so all the people end up working as guards
or cooks or whatever.
Anyway.
It drives the whole town,
and without the privatized prison,
then you're driving the whole town out of money,
and it becomes its own problem.
And the city fathers kiss the ass of the people who run it,
because it's the only trade they've got.
But it's driven,
and how many people are in there for nonviolent crimes?
Victimless crimes.
The whole drug thing, the DEA,
we were always joking half-heartedly,
in a sense, about getting caught by the DEA.
That entire war against drugs
proved to be an absolute,
complete fucking waste of taxpayers' money.
Billions of dollars wasted, billions of dollars wasted.
Probably trillions.
Yeah, trillions.
People's lives, so many lives ruined.
And they still are, with the violence in Mexico.
And it's appalling to me that we go on in this country,
financing this stupid fight on drugs.
Whereas if we at least had some more sensible approach
and policies for it in America,
there wouldn't be this terrible violence on the border.
Anyway, that's it.
My only concern, too, is that legalization
only brings those assholes in the corporate sector
into cannabis to bastardize it more
and ruin it from the inside out.
That's my biggest concern,
but it almost seems inevitable,
because that's what they do,
and then you just take it back.
Yeah, I mean, at least you don't go to jail for it anymore.
Exactly, that's like the one.
The end user can enjoy a calming,
I would say, pleasant evening
without having to worry about having his door broken down
and being thrown in jail.
I think at one point, there was something like 50%
of the incarcerated population was in there for drugs,
nonviolent and victimless crimes.
Just because these goddamn corporations,
and they lobby, of course, for more draconian laws.
Oh, sure, yeah.
So it's a dreadful system.
Anyway, you asked me for a last comment.
That's perfect.
That is absolutely perfect.
My last comment is that Johnny has climbed half-dome.
Oh, shit, half-dome.
Yeah, that's wild.
I can tell from that shape,
you guys wouldn't have a problem
climbing half-dome at all back then.
Not back then, I don't know about now.
Yeah.
My climbing days are done.
I got vertigo now.
In fact, I'll be brief,
but I've just been doing this job up in Moab,
and I was telling Jim that I have to go to the edges.
They want these overlooked,
and it's just what we call a plate unit
where we shoot a cliff or a canyon,
and then they drop in all the CGI stuff in post,
and I have to go to the edge of the cliff.
Anyway, I've got vertigo now,
so my climbing days are done.
I feel like I'm gonna,
there's a magnet pulling me off,
and sometimes I have to lie down
and reach over with the camera.
Oh, no.
Jeez, we'll be safe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I appreciate you coming on the show.
I appreciate, Jim, for having you come on
because this is a tale
that's kind of worked its way through our show,
and it's an absolute honor to speak with someone
who is one of the pioneers of our scene,
so thank you very much for your contributions.
Well, I defer to the expert,
and I was just the muscle, but.
We went our own ways for many years,
but now we're friends and do stuff together,
so it's really nice.
I'm glad you could come on today, Johnny.
All right, my pleasure, Matt.
A pleasure to meet you,
and if I may, I'll send you some links and some photos.
Can't get enough of Vintage Strains?
Go check out the collab we just did,
Riot Seeds and Sucklord,
one of New York's premier toy makers.
We have a resin cast toy, one out of 27,
only 27 made, exclusive to our customers
for the first seven days, so go check it out.
Link's gonna be in the description.
Go show him some support.
It was like I was connected with everything around me.
All of a sudden, I just started questioning
everything I'd ever been told.
You know, by the time I got high that very first time,
when it started to hit me,
and I'm like, wow.
I got high.
