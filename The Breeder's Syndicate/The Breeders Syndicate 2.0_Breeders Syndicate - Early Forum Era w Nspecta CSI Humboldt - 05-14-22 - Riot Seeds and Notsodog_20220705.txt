What's up everyone? I almost did the show on the other account because it's back
up for live feeds but I figured I already told everyone we'd be doing it
here so fuck it right. The last time you'll be seeing this background we're
getting ready I mean we've been moving but finally moving the last of this
stuff probably this weekend so it'll be a whole new background whole new
everything no more ugly fucking checker wall which is awesome yeah so what's up
everyone yes I play this guitar sometimes this is one that has special
pickups and it's uh what do they call them
Seymour Duncan P rails I think yeah it's a brooder to cramp everyone we
will be joined by CSI and not so dog in a few not so it's been a little under
the weather so I'm gonna try to hold it down for him this week he's got the
chest aids so yeah you'll miss the ska wall yeah ugly ass wall though what my
choice but next one will be so we'll see how it goes
sweet fuckwork so Rob oh yeah I got my curly shirt on the man the myth the
legend no I actually really suck at guitar to be honest with you I can play
punk rock and old reggae tunes and some northern soul that's about it how much
is rent out here the place I'm leaving was three thousand a month the where I'm
going slightly less because we bought so it's twenty three hundred roughly a
little bit more but not much it's a lot smaller than this place as far as the
house but the property is big so kind of stoked on that tonight we will be
covering oh what do you smoke and expels tonight we will be covering the forum
era post 2006 which really was I mean I chose that because that's when I come in
so mostly the tail end of overgrow cannabis world a little bit I don't
remember when planet ganja dipped out some grass city troll it up
pop-pimp tricone Kings the farther stuff like that there's a CD post up it yeah I
see Mag of course there's a big point to it too and it's that a lot of people
like that weren't around during the forums it's really easy to tell who they
are and the ones that pretend like they were it's also really easy to tell that
they were because or that they weren't because they only reference the ones
that are still up and only quote the forms that are still up which is a very
very I can't I can't mention that one sub Rob since it's private I don't want
to mention it try to follow rules on that one but um yeah I mean if people
try to quote stuff all the time but you're only seeing a brief glimpse of
what happened back then some of the most salacious fucking horrible shit went
down on sites like C Depot where a lot of people started popping up a lot of
people that are selling seeds are popping up on C Depot and I'm sure they
are super stoked that you can't find that shit but we do have the way back
machine and I actually haven't tested that for C Depot so we'll see yeah
ganja planet ganja was on way back machine as well but only certain threads
were it was really hard to find any consistency and why certain things were
not oh here we go there's not so see I wonder if I can still bring in Caleb
once I bring in the best we got a teacher now to do that I'll see how long
request to join how do I add in people wasabi invite to join okay that's why I
did all right now what's up dude I exist you know you look like you're not dead
yet I am definitely not dead good deal good I'm in need of a shit so yeah what's
up with the third party waiting for him wait for him for a few minutes I just
talked to him we'll be on fantastic yeah so I was just telling everyone we're
gonna be going over the forum era post overgrow so 2006 roughly and on and I
was explaining how there are a lot of forums still up that were around during
that time like the farm I see mad troll it up some of the some of the others it
came around that time but there are a lot that are not up and people that like
to pretend that they were around back then often reference the ones that are
still up that they can go back and like reread and pretend like hey I was I was
there I know what was going on but they're missing like 90% of the
conversations that were going on because those aren't even accessible any longer
one of the one of the things I noticed about that era is that you know a lot of
times we catch people on stuff because people go back to bullshit yes and they
read you know threads and things like that to pick up years and tidbits and
information that like make their their story sound better yeah but they weren't
there to know who was who or like who to take seriously or what was
misinformation even then yeah you know and so a lot of times it's a tell you
know it is a big deal it's a big tell but to someone that never read any of
those forums you can come out and confidently start jabbing about a bunch
of stuff yeah and sound like you were there yeah I'm not I'm not gonna say
anybody's name but someone made a post the other day that obviously was not
around on the forums and said you know X person got cloned from Y person got
cloned from Z person and it was just super off like the most off it could be
I mean we I'm that's learning for me I try we try not to name names when it's
not but it was pretty funny the chain of custody yeah that was asserted you
know you just had you just had to laugh at a certain point but yeah I will say
even back then like you know I don't know exactly know how to describe it but
I would say that like like overgrow even had some of the best commentary but also
some of the worst like you kind of the forums really helped figuring out what
you were doing if you already went in there with some connection and some
ability to discern yeah you know cannabis world was a little bit more
like where the adults gathered yeah overgrow you could have like everyone
from like some 17 year old kid shit posting you even though we didn't use
that term back then yeah till like Camara and Sam skunk man and PhDs and
breeding talking shit and another in another area yeah so it really was like
a cross-section of weed in America my main my main thing would be like I would
compare that to like grass City from my era grass City and roll it up we always
called it troll it up but those two were like what everybody would say like
that's where everybody everybody had an account on those pretty much because
that's where everybody started at during that era and then slowly you'd see
people migrate but then those the ones that hung out in that area area kind of
never really seem to go anywhere as far as their knowledge or making any headway
with anything really that's how I saw it yeah I mean and you know it should be
said to that like you know there was different different forums had different
I don't know different ethics maybe is the best way to put it yeah you know
some some were more lightly moderated and things got left up you know
obviously like hate speech and various other aspects was was eliminated you
know or but a lot of times you know unlike IG or whatever you know if you
didn't like the threads got left they might get locked if arguments got too
heated but they would yeah I'd be left yeah we're in today's environment on IG
a lot of times people just get rid of it yeah oh yeah it's all it's all what do
you call that curated it's all curated as soon as it starts going off the rails
or as soon as they start seeing information they don't want out there
yeah they'll just delete comments or they'll delete the whole thread or
they'll turn off comments yeah right away you know and then you know I see mag
you know there was you know there was an in crowd and out crowd mm-hmm you know
definitely I was the out crowd I I think I had a record for being the person most
banned from every forum and it I think I mean I even had my own forums back in
the day that people rocked on you know it got bad I mean it was interesting in
the sense that like in the beginning in overgrowing cannabis world and stuff I
was super excited and I got on there to share information with a bunch of people
and then you know but I was always nervous about doing any kind like you
know I lived in Mendo or whatever so I didn't really need to like meet new weed
people yeah but I liked learning what other people far away knew yeah but a
lot of people used it in the DMS to trade clones and do all this type of
stuff I never really did that I was more like an in-person kind of kind of guy
yeah and then when obviously when heaven stairway got in trouble and they shut
all that down yeah I got scared so you know this era that we're gonna talk
about like 2006 on it really is CSI and Matt's era yeah it really is where you
know I might have been lurking a little bit and poking around here and there and
even some other friends of ours that aren't gonna join like our buddy high
and lonesome oh yeah yeah you know there was some people that were that were
extremely active in that area sure and know a lot of the who you know who is
who is a jackass who was kind who was a problem back then you know where stuff
came from and one of the interesting things about weed is that it reinvents
itself every five or ten years yeah so you get all these new people coming in
and people get to rebrand themselves yeah now it's happening every six
months it seems yeah well it's modern fast turnover yeah modern marketing
margaret yeah I mentioned that I mentioned this before but it was kind of
like what the what the old deadheads told me about how dead tour used to be
before the Grateful Dead had touch a gray a big hit yeah it was small
everybody knew kind of got vetted in you know things didn't change that much and
then you know oh my god big ups to Danimal okay so then and then and then
there was a top day at a top ten hit and literally hundreds of thousands of new
people showed up yeah and how do you assimilate them into your community that
fast yeah you can't really yeah you know it becomes difficult so a lot of times
like old-timers or whatever they feel overwhelmed yeah because like the norms
of their community and what they could expect you know and instead of being
like a respected elder somebody's like who the fuck is this guy yeah why do I
have to listen to you yeah you know where before when it was smaller like
those people might have had respect yeah yeah it's a much it did get very
different and I want to say it wasn't quite at cookies where everything took a
big swing but it wasn't much long after cookies came around that the forum the
whole idea of forums kind of changed but I think that also had to do with
Instagram which is also why cookies kind of even got even more blown up I think
social media yeah yeah the kind of the difference between the I would say the
forums were mostly writing with some pictures where Instagram flipped it a
hundred and eighty degrees to being exactly all pictures with a little bit
of writing yeah so you see some of these old write-ups that people have and their
paragraphs and you know they're like a small essay yeah right where people ask
me stuff all the time on IG and it's really hard because it's like what are
you gonna write a novel in the comments yeah yeah it's kind of like you're
trying to write something that's like this long like what can I yeah it's like
a haiku yes how can I get my thing across in like X amount of syllables or
four sentences yeah yeah you kind of have to especially if you're on Twitter
right and then and then you end up and then you end up leaving out a lot of
nuance and detail where on the forum era people could like write three or
four paragraphs each back and forth and some like can't be could write really
really just bad really bad and illegible stuff for paragraphs and paragraphs I
mean when you write paragraphs you really realize why we invented
punctuation yeah yeah for sure you know why we invented paragraphs in the first
place spacing periods commas all the various aspects it really helps because
yeah you know what one of the things that hurts you online is that nuance
gets lost yeah it does are you being sarcastic yeah being funny what's your
body language you know all those types of things you know yeah that was
actually a good point you know in the overgrow era digital cameras you know
didn't exist yeah I mean I was talking I was actually talking about that in the
in the one that you missed because you were you know you were otherwise
occupied where it was like people documenting their stuff really advanced
a lot more when digital cameras came out oh yeah and then exponentially once
phones had cameras yeah what's phones had cameras is all bets off the era
where you had to get your own stuff developed that's unsadly it's not oh
yeah I can only imagine it's not very documented I mean I was it I was at CSI's
house I don't know half a year ago or something like that we were looking
through a couple of boxes of his Polaroids right yeah but they fade yeah
that yeah that sucks they fade you know and maybe if you would have kept them in
some kind of like perfectly sealed environment with the right humidity or
something like that you know but yeah you're looking at Polaroids from 95 or
six or seven or whatever and a lot of them the colors are bleeding into each
other and it's hard to make it's not it's not you know it's not shark yeah
you know yeah that sucks that sucks bad I would have never guessed that until he
told me that yeah I mean you know he's got a couple shoeboxes full yeah and I
have busting his chops to get him fucking scanned I was like you got to
get those scanned at least for history's like don't do any good I mean I you know
I had my I had my my first daughter in oh nine you know and I think and I can
look back on my phone I think you know the first real camera on an iPhone came
out in 08 oh now now I don't remember yeah late oh late oh wait you know and
and that's kind of that that was a revolution in itself oh I'm sure cuz
yeah you can just pull it out of your pocket and be like there's my weed plant
click it's always amazing that with all these cell phones we don't really see
many like real documented UFO pics I know I'm it's kind of off tangent but I
just thought about that well I will say as a as a you know somebody who's
pulled a lot of tarps in their day mm-hmm that you know a lot of times when
you pull tarp on you you're doing light depth you're pulling tarp at six or
seven o'clock at night right yeah and then you go back out there after dark
which in June might be 930 or 10 o'clock at night mm-hmm right so pull the tarp
off so everything can breathe because you only want to darken it for as much
as you need to right oh yeah and you don't want to trap in all that moisture
and all that right so you got to go out there and you know Mendo or whatever in
the woods and sometimes I would see the most beautiful skies the most beautiful
moons just yeah and your phone could not show you what my eyes could see oh yeah
for sure I would take I would take you know pictures and you know and it would
just never and I'd go online and look how do I take better night photos yeah
and it's just not a camera with like a nice lens and you know the ability to
like you know it's just not it's just meant to show dicks and tits that's all
you're supposed to be taking pictures of fellows ladies you know and and so you
know there's there's an aspect to that where it's like I can bet like if you
can't see like nobody can imagine how beautiful this full moon is tonight yeah
and you can't capture that well how are you gonna capture like I'm sure there's
like this is that there's a weird thing in the sky it's yeah how are you gonna
do you know especially back in oh eight or oh nine how am I gonna pull out my
two or two and a half megapixel camera yeah on my phone yeah I'm gonna like
capture it no you know it took a long time for phones to even begin to catch
up to like what 35 millimeter could do you're busting my skeptical comments
not so you know rushing my skepticism I fully believe that there are aliens I
just disbelieve most people that tell them try to tell me a bunch of facts
about them yeah yeah that's my sure there are I just don't know if they've
ever been near earth you know like I I have that that's where my skepticism
comes in when people start writing getting like very long YouTube's about
all kinds of specifics you know yeah I get weird yeah yeah I mean I'll say this
you know and then Kayla and then he's officially fucking late yeah but you
know when we were talking about the the early the early 2000s or whatever I you
know I did that whole episode when you weren't here yeah I was hunting so hard
for old stuff then stuff from the 80s stuff from the 70s hell even stuff from
some of the 90s yeah and it was a royal bitch and nobody cared about it and I
searched for years and years and years and you know like we have a pretty good
network of friends yeah you know and it was really hard and now within the last
five years as ancient stuff has become popular mm-hmm and I'm not please don't
take this the wrong way if anybody's holding anything but I've never seen
so much like 79 blueberry 72 you know Brotherhood of Eternal Love Acapulco
gold you know 74 wahaken you know this that like all these 70s and 80s strain
all the famous strains of your yeah hey hey it's not dark it's just blurry
what do you got he's in that humble fog you smudge your camera on purpose he
blew a lot on the camera so but wait the Sun's going down so you know good to see
you dude thanks for showing up right right so yeah we were just talking about
the different you know what was kind of going around post 2006 it was the end of
the overgrow era end of the cannabis world era and maybe maybe you could talk
about some of the things that you saw during those those that integral period
between the end of overgrow and the beginning of things like the farm what
kind of what kind of strains were people fucking with around then what was the
hot shit are you talking about like oh six on oh six to like oh six to oh eight
somewhere in there yeah yeah yeah I mean I think that's when chem dog really started
become unpopular yeah and chem D came out I think I honestly think that that's the year
you know mass G posted up on IC mag although that's right that thread is gone oh is that
thread gone I did my research I think it's gone is that the creation of sour D1 no no
no that's oh that was the overgrow that was okay so yeah that that's well long gone unless
somebody has a archives so do you remember like around overgrow what kind of the strains
what kind of strains were mostly popular around that time like in the in that end of overgrow
era Amsterdam strains Dutch Dutch yet yeah can they do a lot of these stuff yeah BC stuff
yeah it was kind of it was kind of like a lot of the stuff that was that some of those
Ron parties yeah yeah yeah right we're actually where Caleb and I first met you know it was
a lot of white widow and blueberry and a lot of the work coming out of Switzerland was
right then so like the sweet tooth the blockhead the Louie genius yeah you know and and c99
were around back then for sure genius c99 you know I forget is genius Apollo but you
know the Apollo 11 and 13 hybrids of all that stuff and it was it was pre pre reversals
you guys hadn't really started your revolution yet so it was all males well we were borderline
starting it that's yeah it was just kicking off I mean Hyde was Hyde was selling his exe
way back in like I don't know what oh two maybe even earlier yeah on a cannabis world
and I did my first you know real reversal in oh six intentional reversal intentional
reversal I I did that one reversal where you know I took a bunch of pollen from that urkel
back in like 304 and yeah yeah that was oh 304 and pollinated a bunch of stuff on purpose
yeah but that that was just that freak thing so yeah it counts it does count it was with
intention yeah yeah I mean there there there I did have some friends that I mean we didn't
use I didn't we didn't know anything about any of the any of the chems you could spray
on plants but people used to try to torture their plants to get them to free if it was
if you knew it could hurt sometimes you could put it into too small of a pot you could let
it get dry you could beat it up a bit you could try to collect see if it could throw
some that was like the that was like our way of you know right can you beat it up enough
to get some pollen off it remember a soma's soma's way you just fly them out for like
80 or 90 days and get a couple bananas yeah wrote a lot of utilization yeah yeah I don't
know where he got that term from for it but yeah I remember yeah yeah he's a special guy
actually I did like is when his book came out or whatever I do like the soma beds I don't know that
they were interesting they were interesting they're just they're just deep indoor beds on
wheels yeah no yeah basically what they were you know with with you know some drainage in the
bottom and some layering you know maybe they have some rocks and they have some like and then they
have a layer of ground cover or something and then you put soil on top and and they have ever seen
huh they had the air tubes on them in all four corners where the air came down to the lower
you would like big pieces of PVC with holes drilled in and you put those on the side and
those would go all the way in the corners to the bottom yeah so that you would actually
and that would connect to the gravel at the bottom so that you bring air yeah yeah it wasn't
the worst idea no I've done that especially trees and especially for well it's not so much you had
to go trees you know I mean you know look no look at look at a bunch of you could you could actually
grow a bed with you know homie style with 25 or 30 plants if you wanted yeah right right you know
and then you didn't have to worry about individual ones dying right right because you just watered
the bed and everything stays alive oh yeah I used to use those no drain beds way back in a 2000 or
so no drain beds just shallow like six beds you know that worked out I did pretty good yeah yeah
um definitely some interesting stuff that was back in my not so organic days I used I used to know
this used to be pretty funny where I used to know a lot of guys in Mendo that were organic like
April through August and then come August they're like not or September they're not quite seeing
their buds get as big as they want and then they figure like well what's one big tub of pink powder
gonna really do to my organic it's it's basically organic yeah yeah just a couple a couple doses of
this zero 50 30 it's gonna get me where I need to be and it's gonna make it happy and I've been
organic for five months already you know so it'll all flush out at the end and it's definitely still
organic yeah that stuff was us yeah bud blaster three cheers for grow more yeah but I was the
but but blaster was the was the Canadian heady version yeah yeah it was Canadian it was it was it
was it was one of those you know powdered whatever it was all this it was all the same there was a
bunch of people that came out with zero 50 30 and tried to make it seem like their zero 50 30 was
special right monosodium one thing I'll say about the the bud blaster is that they had a they had
their own special grinder mm-hmm so their powder was super fine and it actually dissolved some of
the cheap stuff you get there in like a thousand gallon tank or whatever and you're up on a ladder
and you're dumping stuff like that in there and then you get some softballs at the bottom that
you're like wondering how to hit with a stick to break up because it wouldn't actually dissolve
yeah you know right so but that's off topic you know I suppose we should probably ratchet back
around so we got to convince we got to convince Caleb and Matt to talk because this is really
their era yeah this is oh six oh seven oh eight oh nine this is not my online presence right so the
various characters the various things that were going on the stuff that was happening it's pretty
much this is when these two you know CSI used to be known as you know white trash redneck
you know but that but that's where I mean you know archive was doctor or the doctor yeah right
yeah yeah you know it's where a lot of the Monica a lot of the oldest nicknames and monikers people
still kind of reference each other like by some of those first names yeah mm-hmm yeah I don't know
nobody's real name you didn't need to ain't no purpose in it you know yeah and unlike IG you
didn't you never a lot of these people you never saw yeah always asked me like what what's his name
I'm like fucking no I asked him that you know that's just weird yeah she thinks I'm a freak for
not knowing anybody's first names after all these years I don't fucking know I don't like it do his
taxes for him but then you know that for it was very it was very similar to that on like we're
on dead tour and stuff like that because everybody you know everybody had a nickname yeah yeah you
know everybody had a nickname yeah but yeah I mean maybe maybe you guys could talk about like
you know who who who were some of the big I don't want to say the word influencer maybe but who are
some of the people that were sort of like driving the conversations who are you excited to hear you
know posting on stuff like and then maybe just like how hard it was to get information back then
because a lot of these forums you know you guys were talking about the chem dog you know there
was an aspect where the reason why you know somebody like you know skunk VA has his name
or chem dog 101 or any of these things is because I had some form or another on IC mag or whatever
it was the first time these things started getting argued about and debated yeah by people outside
and a lot of times what happens too is that these things become references because then you've got
this guy comes out and says this thing on IC mag at this year and then three years later on whatever
on roll it up let's say he's saying this and now on IG he said this and this you know and they
always they always want to be like this is the most current story this is what you should believe
yeah yeah and in some cases those forms don't exist anymore and they're very fortunate that
they don't and you know one of the one of the ways that CSI got his reputation as inspector is
he was really good at using your own words against you hey yeah well I just but I just mean in the
sense of someone would like confidently say this this this this and this and then he would be like
well why did you write your own words that bastard it's right how do you make these two
things come together I've got a bunch of swerve quotes I can share you know and that's a lot of
things most people probably don't even know who swerve is but there's been there's been a bunch
of people you know that come that you know flash in the pans that come and go yeah they come up
they have their moment they they they spew a bunch of shit they make a bunch of money all
of a sudden their stories start to implode right yeah and you know and in some cases they rebrand
themselves and sell it again do it to the to the new badge right right you know who I looked up to
is gonna be a lot different than maybe who Caleb looked up to because when I first started coming
in it was way different than when Caleb started coming in you know so who like who were you
looking up to during those years or who is who do you think was influencing really well that that
had some respect during those years um I mean I liked you know just just for information you know
alone I liked Joe Brand I liked you know chem dog mass G yeah you know skunk VA yeah and then
on like the the OG side of things you know I was I always liked you know Big Ricky he was old family
red back then I actually a lot of people don't even know but I named my old family purple my
first TK hybrid kind of after his old handle old family red you know oh I didn't even know that
yeah you know I get connected yeah I gave him a lot of credit you know chrome that was those were
the years chrome was starting out with the white you know yeah he actually was growing some of my
my hybrids and then he introduced the white when he was growing them so yeah that's when that started
I think I was mostly into Bubba's oh geez and chem dogs back then yeah but uh what what were your
your main main interest though so when I popped in you know like Shanti Baba was still pretty big
and still had a good name a lot of the stuff I was looking at when I came in was was Dutch stuff
I really didn't focus a lot on Americans at the time because I just didn't I wasn't hip to it you
know I hadn't right when I came in I wasn't hip to the fact that all those dudes were white labeling
and most the Americans were making their seeds or Spanish or actually back then I don't even know
who was making the motherfucker seeds you know right but yeah I mean it was very different I
mean greenhouse hadn't been totally trashed it was still kind of under the radar for new people at
the time that that they were doing anything you know untoward DNA was massive during those years
they were why I started doing six seeds a pack because their shit was six seeds a pack and they
were the ones selling the most I was like okay I guess that's what you do you know what I mean
right yeah and then sub cool of course it just started fucking taking off and I was fortunate
that I met Sonny Chiba very early on so I learned very quickly oh maybe that guy isn't someone I
should be looking at for breeding tips you know right right it took me a while but I got it yeah
that's it was it was a much different take yeah it's interesting then because that's kind of when
everybody first came out of the shadows yeah and you can walk out of the shadows with any stories
you wanted about yourself or the strains or whatever else and a lot of times you were the
only person you know from Sam's got man on yeah you were the only part you were the only person
telling the story about those strengths right right I mean you remember huh the audience was
so small finding people who are actually there you know was was very difficult yeah it was it
was a lot smaller than now I just know you think people that came later can grasp how small the
community was mm-hmm and how she well information was mm-hmm now it's pretty rapid-fire right you
know and a lot of people connect all the time oh yeah somebody said crunch bubble you know that guy
I mean he that guy used to move massive amounts of what was it blue dot through the third floor in
Oakland you know he had all those warehouses of 600 watt HPS is on hydro tables bumping out a
bunch of stuff for third floor but it was you know what what's funny about that guy is that some of
those pictures were like some of the first warehouse scenes that people were willing to
like throw up on IG on on the internet yeah most people were growing in closets or bedrooms or
greenhouses or in the woods or wherever and all of a sudden you see a 40 lighter right and for a
lot of people that was the first time right it might look rudimentary now yeah now yeah but even
just then in 05 or 06 or something like that you know finding people and I think too that like what
most people don't understand maybe is that a lot of the a lot of the breeders like that got famous
later like a couple people on the show or whatever like almost all the breeders were European or
American or Canadian yeah right and the people that were working breeding in America we're
generally doing it through friendship circles there was a lot of trading and via DM amongst
friends and amongst contemporaries it wasn't like like on you know at least from what I remember it
wasn't like oh I've got a big drop coming next Friday here's the 15 here's the names I made up
for him here's the hybrids here's where you can get them here's how we're gonna sell them all it
was like you know you trade seeds when you saw people or people were trade selling them via DM
or something like that like but it was different I remember as far as Americans went there was not a
lot of Americans doing direct sales on websites you would never really see that like it was all
done you know DMS or like on weird little auction sites that were floating around but other than
that there wasn't a really good way to market yourself as an American breeder without mostly
giving seeds away to people I mean did you have that experience CSI mm-hmm I I didn't get involved
in any of I wanted to back in the 06 08 era I looked into it but you know I was still way too
paranoid to do any of that stuff yeah I should have done it you know like you know DNA and sub
cool and hell even swerve you know yeah you know I mean all those guys you know made huge names
because there wasn't competition yeah there's no competition you didn't really have to have a
whole lot of talent to be very successful you know what you said mr. soul handled all of SSC in the
80s well I mean what's interesting about that is that you know there's been a lot there's been a
lot of talk about American SSC right yeah and you know Matt and myself got to interview the owner
who was very cool and you know all that kind of stuff got put to rest yeah hard there wasn't there
wasn't any American help no room for maneuver but it goes but it goes to show how you know in our
world you can kind of step out of the shadows and be like oh I mean there was a lot of people that
you know they came out of the shadows and they were the first time that people were like you
know oh I'm I this is my cut yeah and then it turns out that they just got the cut early yeah
but they got a few years of like oh if you want to use my cut you got to give me 50% of the proceeds
of the seeds or you got to pay me or you got a this or you got a that it's my work it's my my my
my and then it comes out later that they just got it from these other people early but they were the
first one to go public right you know and a lot of times what happened is is that the first person
to go public you know got credit yeah yep you know you know they got credit and their story was the
for a minute and sometimes other people would get upset and get online and start you know I mean I
actually think that's kind of what got you know you were talking about cam that's kind of what
got cam online was you know skunk VA got online a bit you know and started talking about different
things and then we're like oh my weeds famous I should talk about it right and then that got and
then that got that got Joe brand and and P bud and other people that hadn't really met met up or
like even linked or even realized what was going on after 15 years to connect right because of
stories 707 seed bank shabad he's the one who you know got skunk VA on to overgrow and icy mag to
actually post about that stuff otherwise I think there'd be a completely different chem dog history
oh yeah if he hadn't done that you know do we remember what the very very first claim of the
chem dog seats not necessarily the first one people remember but the very first claims of
chem dog who is the first one to claim that string was it even Greg or were there other people popping
up as it was getting popular going that's mine I'm bread that shit I don't remember anybody claiming
it lots of people claiming they had the 91 or oh yeah yeah sure it's just like well I don't know
how all these different cuts could be hit there right one oh you know because it's purple that's
how you know when it hurts I saw a few chem dog cats and they they some of them look like mass
super skunk chem dogs yeah but that just basically means somebody bought some weed that it was was
called chem dog and it had some seeds in it and whatever had pollinated that chem dog you know
and chem dogs not a bad hermaphrodite just by itself I mean not so yeah you know no and so
usually if you find seeds in your chem dog you know it's been pollinated by something else yeah
well there was there was also a thing too that was there was really confusing I think and this isn't
anything against Greg or chem dog but you know it's it's like for people that want specific
lineages he was pretty famous for you when you buy weed you're buying chem dog weed from chem dog
it didn't really matter exactly what it was it was weed from chem dog and so I think that created
confusion too because everyone was like oh it's this one specific thing you know but it really
was chem dog yeah just branding I mean back then branding was branding you know it was it was it
was early it was an early form of branding yeah for sure you know and people weren't and a lot
of these guys were young and nobody knew especially then when things first started getting famous I
don't think anybody knew that some of these strains were gonna be so lastingly famous mm-hmm so a lot
of times they wrote down various stories or this or that and they didn't really expect it to get
become part of Canon or become part of the fabric of the tail and then they have to look back and
defend it you know and you know it's hard for people sometimes to say you know my memory was
a little that's what I remembered at the time you know right after more after more information came
out and I talked to more friends I've kind of revised a little bit because other people had
it's hard for people to say that a lot of times people would dig in their heels yeah and then
you've got two or three or four versions of the story and you're trying to figure out which one
works mm-hmm which one is the most believable right you know what what's your favorite wildest
story from the forum errors that you knew I mean you that that you knew was kind of like that's too
fucking stupid to even be possible do you have any that stick out where you're like that was a bold
fucking claim and really wonky what comes to mind when I say that okay so I hate to keep bringing up
my boy swerve it doesn't really have a whole lot to do with him but the guy he got pretty much most
all of his early og cuts from in 0607 this guy had an account on IC mag and then he made up
another account and I think this was in 07 and he made up another account pretending to be his own
mentor you know with all the same spelling errors all the same you know type styles all that and
he made a whole thread on it and acted like you know he was the original creator of the OG Kush
blah blah blah and his boy right here his little student you know he's he's best student I ever had
were of our boy and we hooked him up we laced him with all those those cuts we've held since the
80s yeah that there's still that story on on a I see Matt it's still like God you know and I'm up
in there with a bunch of other clowns just laughing away you know but that that one right there was
it was pretty much the tops for for me back in those days I got one for you I got one for you
little old lady with Asian fantasy oh that was a really good one too I like that was a good one
yeah yeah that one was was a there was a string called Asian fantasy made famous I think I think
it's fair to say about the canon Bible Jason King pretty much made that strain very much so yeah
known it wasn't a well-known strain I don't think was it no no no and you know he he talked about
the rarity and how this guy never lets it out blah blah blah a few years later a person that
we we know who it was but I don't think he'll ever admit it right went on and tried to say
that she was the the wife of the man who held Asian fantasy and he has died and she wants to
get those genetics out there you know and ended up I think it's pretty sure it was NYC kid kind of
big upping himself trying to give himself some provenance on a cut he never had access to well
we don't honestly we don't know that part of it because who have you or anybody ever seen this
Asian fantasy keyword fantasy outside of the canon Bible and NYC kid and his crew no I mean it's kind
of a fantasy yeah and in fact African black magic I mean there's some there's some pictures
of it or whatever but I mean Jason King even talked about how homie wouldn't give it out to
anyone and you know was it was a massive hoarder of it you know and so there's an aspect to it
there too where it's like people people can hoard something so much that it doesn't become famous
yeah right you know because nobody ever sees it like before before this forum time that you were
talking about there was probably like you know four or five people or something in California that
had the chem 91 and someone just said I have Asian fantasy s1's from th gobs so he's still doing it
go NYC kid you go but yeah I mean it was like one of those things we're like if you know if if OG
Kush if some of it if some of these famous things don't slip out and people don't start cropping
them you know there was an aspect where it was like for a long time there was only four or five
garages pumping chem 91 yeah like every you know so how much weed is that not very much
doesn't really give you very much opportunity to try it doesn't really get give you an opportunity
for like a fad to you know like if OG hadn't snuck out if all those guys hadn't been money hungry
down there in LA and it snuck out it probably wouldn't have had that kind of impact yeah
because it has to be there you have to be able to get that even even if you have to pay a lot
for it you do have to be able to access it right so Asian fantasy is one of those things where like
it you know it never got out and then so as a result of that it allowed scammers to be like
this is it right and how could you tell the difference hey you know you you still you still
buddies with the with old Jason Mr. King I haven't spoken to him in a minute but we're cool
yeah he lives on Maui I know I wonder if you can ask him kind of maybe some of it because I talked
to him before I like met you met you yeah you know he he he affirmed that you know all my information
was right and then he was like where'd you where'd you find all this stuff out you know so
I mean he might know some some background details that you know definitely didn't make it into the
book about yeah I bet who one of the one I've been actually thinking about reaching out and
talking to him because one of the things that's interesting is that he probably has a shit ton of
pictures of weed from myself and my and some and friends and then people that I don't know
obviously too but that didn't make it in the book yeah because you know you might take you know
dozens or hundreds of pictures or something and then to make it yeah you pick a couple
um you know uh and and all that but he um you know and I think I think the Asian fantasy that
he was talking about was in Hawaii I think it could have been I want to say I remember and I
could be totally wrong so maybe I shouldn't say it but I think I think Bodhi knows the Asian fantasy
person maybe I might be wrong I don't know I'm gonna ask him to figure it out I mean to me it's
one of the it's it's one of those like legendary strains you know yeah that like just never I mean
you know there's I'll mention another one do any of you guys have any uh any um uh experience with
Elvis yes yes but I don't know if it was I don't know how real it was it was just a cut called
because there's some really famous stuff out there that just it was never in my crew never in like
the extended circles of crews and you hear about him for a long time and it got famous in various
aspects but it's just like you know I also thought I had Albert Walker too though so there is that
you know like who knows who knows never got it from a good source that they could say yes this
is where I got it none of that shit uh last one I had I passed off to skunk master flex and I don't
think he backed it up and your Albert Walker was the orangey one right yep they go Walker yeah
good old day go yep um did you ever see the mothership come through I can't remember if you
said yeah uh-huh yeah so I told this story before but like it got mailed to one of our spots
so uh Jason King's I don't think it's shade to say this but his girlfriend at the time was this
chick named Rebecca yeah and she was from Asheville area of North Carolina and so she
you know he used to rave about that cut all the time and so she finally got some of her friends
to send it to us yeah right and dude it was like uh our buddy high and lonesome has a terrible story
uh but um it was kind of like that in the sense where I was expecting to get this tiny little box
with some clones and we got this box that was like you know this big by two feet tall or whatever
and it was two mothership plants in one gallon pots with steaks and each one was about 18 inches
tall in 03 or something like that and it was like so all those pictures in the can of bible that you
see of mothership those all came from those two moms that got mailed to us yeah and then we mom
those out and uh you know it got they got grown at eddie lepps and they got grown to various
friends houses and stuff like that so I actually had I actually I had the mothership for four or
five years I think um and uh it wasn't I think it was a super unique plant uh it wasn't one of them
I didn't have it didn't have the nicest flavor I didn't really like the flavor that much but it had
a pretty cool high and it did this weird thing where it would fall half over but then hold itself
up so like you know how most branches if they flop they flop it would like flop but then it would
like raise itself up and it would grow sideways through your garden almost kind of a little like
train wreck it would get would catch itself and just like and it had like these it was a really
sativa um it had thin leaves and it was big branchy thing um but you know I mean I honestly
like compared to all the other shit we've been talking about like bubba's and chems and you know
super scum it was it was a little midzy you know uh in hell reality but it was one of those things
that probably like was genetically very different than everything else so I like I like you know we
like those weird things uh real quick to touch back on Elvis since you were you were on THC
farmer's stuff for a long time right Caleb or at least attentive to it um I was on the outskirts
of the devil's harvest crew um back in those days too and uh there was there were some of those guys
that one circulated through that crew a good bit and it it started uh I think E-Rock from maybe like
I don't know if I should say a stay eh it's a long time over uh you know uh I think he's he
circulated Elvis for a while through there I wouldn't be surprised if a doctor maybe had grown
it because he uh he was he was real good buddies with a lot of those cats and I mean the whole
time I was I was online I only I only traded cuts uh through the mail maybe uh I only received
cuts through the mail twice I think um I like you know 40 50 plus you know uh packages of cuts but
I only received twice I did all my other business just in person up and down the west coast so
that's me I'm very much I'm in person do you remember uh Miss Elvis from the farm
I wasn't very active on the farm at all very very little it was a person who showed like they were
the main person showing the the Elvis cut back then there was something called like the pink
Cadillac cut and then there was the Elvis cut um that's that's the only person I ever got it from
but I never they disappeared like not even a month after giving it to me but they were the ones that
were always documenting it on the farm but I never knew if that was if it's just someone from that
bullshit and made their way through because they disappeared so fast uh after me getting it from
them was it super incensy uh no it was exactly like what they talk about like a vinyl smell
vinyl just artificial vinyl yeah not incensy at all one of the things is kind of interesting
about that era too is it's kind of like the last era before like the the clone name dominance thing
started happening where everyone's growing og or everyone's growing sour or everyone's growing
all that kind of stuff so there was a lot of these odd strains you know not odd in the sense
that there's anything wrong with them just odd odd random strains that were easily sold you know
and so they they people liked them and they got traded yeah you know people weren't looking
necessarily for like oh I need to get this specific cut because I'm going to be able to
move it and it's going to go for x price you know they were more interested in like the legend or
the history uh or whatever of said cut or the person behind it and you could get on there and
start talking about your cut and all of a sudden drum up a bunch of interest yeah and especially
like if we wanted to go back um you know when we were talking about how small it was I mean think
about how revolutionary you know just some some of matt's favorite some of blueberry stuff got
you know and how it looked there wasn't that much competition there wasn't that much stuff
outside of europe or shanti or sensi or you know uh simon from sirius or some of that stuff like
there wasn't that many american breeders so the few people that were doing it like
like mr soul or or dj short or whoever that were willing to to show their work I think it kind of
got like outsized you know outsized impact you know like cindy 99 probably got way more famous
than it should have the super financially you know just to be just to be just to be perfectly
honest I don't think in today it would have the same lasting impact right now not today
no it wouldn't it wouldn't have it wouldn't have been able to break through but it was like so
I do think because it is is like when you try to think of an outdoor plant that's fast enough
and still considered sativa to most people I think that it's it would be very hard to find
a replacement for c99 that's that fast with those type of high qualities and I think that also had
a major effect because it was it's a perfect outdoor plant for blasting fast you know and it
could be grown indoors I just mean it got like all his work got real there wasn't that much
competition so there was a lot of time to talk about you know like not only cindy 99 but like
we were like the genius or the apollo or this or that or whatever or like you know everybody got
plenty of time to debate the four or five things that dj released yeah because there just wasn't
that there wasn't that many different things you know there wasn't that many now there's there's
thousands of breeders and so standing out is very hard then it was like you know what was what was
there like you know a dozen big people doing stuff yeah it was a lot easier for people to
fucking keep other people down too like the ones at the top since there wasn't a lot of competition
and they held a lot of sway they could really cut fuckers throats real fast and it happened a lot
too and it was a lot easier to do that you know I would have probably got cut then if I had even
tried to start back then dude I like I said I was banned off every forum and it got to the point
where I was like fuck this I'm gonna start my own forum like mr nice I never got banned from
um I got asked to leave after a picture contest because the the right berry pictures beat out one
of mr nice's and he thought that was kind of fucked of me to put it in um but yeah all the
rest of them it was really hard because a lot of the ones a lot of people that were running those
forums also had a seed company right and most of those seed banks and seed companies would eventually
start fucking people and if you were one of those people to speak up you're done you know they don't
want you around yeah I mean I I see mag definitely had some of that aspect to it too yeah there was
the in crowd and the out crowd you know for sure as as far as that goes I'm just surprised that
forum is still alive after everything that went on with it yeah see people somebody talked about
that people talk about 89 super skunk there was no 89 super skunk one of the one of the things that
gets that that annoys the hell out of me uh honestly and this isn't to call out whoever has
89 super skunk but just in general is like they'll take the first year that something was ever
released or named and be like I have that weed from a year or two before then yeah that's a big
problem like so the first time super skunk ever got used was in the 1990 seed bank catalog yeah
that's when it had a picture that's when it had a name that's when nevel released it you know um
and so people are like oh I've got the 89 super skunk well how you know and then they're like oh
you know then they got to come up with like well you know it was all that pre-release special shit
because I my my uncle was buddies with homie who gave it down on special kickdown oh they'll be
like you know you know I got that 95 93 cents star I actually have pictures of that 1989 super skunk
they look awful cookie-ish it's pretty pretty but you know it happens all the time and then you see
a lot of these old cuts right now the years keep getting earlier and earlier yeah you know I mean
one thing and this isn't you know this isn't to you know obviously uh bodies use this or whatever
else right but there is no g13 hash plant in the 88 catalogs no no it came out in the 89 catalog
for the first year 89 and 90 you know but 88 is much better it sounds nice you know and I'm not
trying to throw any shade on it or anything like that there's plenty of people that have found nice
weed and you know buddy made a bunch of hybrids with it and it came from ndn guy I think right
yeah yeah uh original originally or whatever you know he reproduced it but it's like it got released
in 89 yeah right but everyone calls it the great you know the 88 right close enough you know all
details those that you know some of that first piff some of that first stuff they talk about
they'll call it the great 88 yeah that shit got released in 89 so there's a bunch of stuff out
there where people will be like this cut is from a year or two before this line ever got released
here's a quick question though I mean I have zero experience in this uh because I was living in my
you know hole in humble but um uh you you were there so or maybe maybe you were there years
later what was the possibility of them doing uh releases of their seeds um at the canvas cups
um so that so that is true it is possible like for instance the first cannabis cup I went to the
was the jack harrier cup uh-huh and the whole thing was themed on him right right and it was
all about like it was the whole like all the festivities were all about the emperor wears no
clothes and they released jack harrier seeds um you know from uh uh in 95 94 yeah 95 they
released them but they it was you know it was late november right um but it wasn't in the catalog
till the following year right so it was like literally it was literally the first time for
instance uh jack was dropped was at the camp was at the cannabis cup right in late november so I
suppose you could have gotten it jack harrier at least six weeks before the year turned right right
you know I mean uh for example salmon creek big bud um you know uh you know homeboy homeboy from
salmon creek you know he bought those seeds at the cup the year it won the cup and then smuggled
50 of those seeds home in his little belt you know hide away belt thing and that's you know
his selection from those uh sensi big bud seeds or whatever is what made salmon creek big bud
I mean that's that's definitely possible a lot of times um a lot of new seed releases
would get dumped in late november then because because it was like an industry gathering
right right and there was tons of and honestly there was tons of custies there
I ended up hating going to Amsterdam for the cannabis cup I went three times and then never
again mostly because it sucked uh and the reason it sucked was that uh Amsterdam is pretty far north
and so it's cold as shit in late november there right so you can go in summer and it's nice and
it's beautiful and you're on a bicycle and you're cruising around all stoned or you can go when it's
sleeting and 29 degrees and that's not as nice you know and then all the best weed would get
saved for celebrities that were coming in and a who's who so there was worse weed to get because
it was all getting saved for you know snoop dog or you know sam skunk man's friends or you know
whoever whoever the high times crew or whatnot and then on top of that you could buy tickets to go to
the cannabis cup out of high times right so you go to europe on vacation and the coffee shops are
full with all these dudes from jersey and new york yeah screaming about wanting to get the best bud
in the world so it's like you fly 12 hours away from your house and you're surrounded by a bunch
of obnoxious east coasters and there's not as good weed and it's crowded and it's cold and it's
raining or it's snowing and it's like i much preferred going there in summer you know just
because it was nice and chill you know but it was like an event that was like the it was it was an
event then you know um and you know really like the story goes you know uh neville didn't even
want to release jack harrier that year um he didn't think he didn't think he didn't think it
was done but they wanted something new and hot that they could call jack harrier
and isn't the story of of fucking uh cindy 99 that it fucking dude bought jack harrier in a
coffee shop and found seeds in it yep and then took him home and started his whole cubing
fucking princess whatever thing that he did i don't think rick did anything like that i'm just
saying that's the story yeah you know he found bag seed and uh in buds that he bought at a coffee
yeah yep yep yep you know c99 and genius are are both uh jack harrier at best hybrids
yeah and really like and you know i think back then that was even earlier like we weren't using
the improper term back cross yet or you know bx uh they were talking about fucking wasn't it cubing
yeah yeah it was it was cubing you were cubing it you were like
fucking and they had all those like long-winded posts on on fucking the forums about what
percentage and how much it was increasing with every one you did and laying it all out you know
yeah there was some really bad breeder tech being shared that seemed cutting edge at the time
and you know people still repeat that fucking shit like like uh mantra oh you gotta back cross
it four times and you get that's as good as an s1 that's a clone and i saw and i i saw somebody
talking about i like the super silver haze better than the jack harrier um the whole reason super
silver haze exists is because um neville didn't feel like the jack harrier project was ready for
prime time he just released it due to you know alan and ben drunkers from sensi were businessmen
and so when he left he kept working on it and then a couple years later i think in 97 or something
he they released mango and neville and super silver haze because he felt like you know they'd
actually gotten somewhere right right right but they still did a couple and i actually think that
was the last big release that neville ever did right um but i mean i smoked that that super
silver haze cut because two i went in 90 i was basically like every other year like i went 97
and 99 too to the cups and those last two cups that super silver haze was all over the place
because that was that was in that was like the first and third year at one it was like the hot
shit over there right right it really was it was the hot shit i mean it was super there was a feno
of it that went like 14 weeks uh will the community let rez back into play uh rez is doing
his own thing you know uh what most people don't know about rez and our our a couple of buddies
remind reminded me of not that long ago was like before all the bullshit with the with the law
enforcement and all that um he was a dick online anyway you're right big time he was a big time
jerk generally a pain in the ass to get along with not a pleasant homie yeah despite despite
any of the rest of the bull whatever you want to believe about you know all the mess that happened
legally or whatever uh yeah he was a he was an early troll he was a jackass he had a huge ego
he still does he he had a decent level of intelligence which would have been i think
much more appreciated if he hadn't had so much ego with it yeah a little more humid you know i
mean not you know a bunch of ego and a bunch of rudeness you know there was some root there was
some rude people you could put up with a little bit better but they were like borderline geniuses
right right right you know like tom hill could be a real dick if you ask the dumb question
i wouldn't know anything about ass being rude that's you know i mean put up with it you know
or sam skunk man he could be a dick too because you know you get tired of i've told the same
story five billion times right you're gonna question me you're 23 shut the fuck up you're
a cocksucker you know yeah eat my dick you know basically you know rude
kind of rude you know but it's hard it's hard to have patience you know and let's face it right
a lot of us are weirdos a lot of us don't have the greatest interpersonal skills to begin with
you know yourself it really is i mean speaking for me i probably have a little bit more than
your average grower just a bit yeah you know but a lot but a lot of them it's like you know we're
kind of harsh edges people that live in the hills don't talk to people hang out with plants
and they're really good with plants and they're not so good with social interaction
right so you put those people on the forums and you put those people like you know on ig or
whatever and it's like it's not the easiest thing i did have an adjustment period that
i will admit i had an adjustment period of where i may have been a little meaner in responses and
talking to people a little snappy maybe a little bit of ego you know it happens but some of us grow
into beautiful smiling faces like this well i'm also still banned from breed bay for uh picking
on sub cool it's also it's also the way i look at it is like you know i mean everybody has the
natural inclination sometimes but it's like are you trying to get your point across you trying
to fucking argue on it right oh here's this dude who says his dad created dog bud i remember that
guy he's trying to dox me i think i'm gonna balk him okay there you go i mean the thing the thing
about the one thing we'll say about dog bud and then we'll move on is that joe brand and p bud
were buying and selling weed on dead tour all the time for cash to go see dead shows right and this
one weekend they sold some weed and then they mailed greg some more weed and then 15 years went
by before they even heard anything cool came out of it right they literally they never saw chem 91
or anything like that until oh six until the reunion when the forums got people back together
they had no idea they were on dead tour right they met they this you know you know these guys
uh greg was in it was a teenager from the east coast and they sold him some weed in indiana
right which was just one stop on summer tour and you're buying pounds and you're selling eighths and
quarters and halves and ounces and it ran out and you buy some other pounds and you just keep doing
that and you did that for a while and one of these sales turned into something and now you want to
hey 15 years ago do you remember uh it was summer uh on dead tour do you remember this one couple
pounds you had that you were hustling for like a weekend do you have any clear memory of that
because it's kind of important well i think uh i think you might have uh remembered just because
he um hit joe brand up you know g hit hit joe brand up again and had him mail him some more
weed i think two right two ounces and we don't even know if the seeds came from the deer creek show
or the seeds came from the weed that joe sent him later it's i from based on the stories i've kind of
deciphered i i think it it came from the ones that was sent that one had no seeds but then again we
know g stories are a little up and down i mean you know not to i like two of my favorite cuts
of all time come out of g's little rooms but i will say that um all of us on this thing have tried
to uh have tried to interpret what he meant by rejuvenating the 91 after it got tired in 94
oh i always rejuvenate them rejuvenate yeah the rejuvenation he had to let it go and rejuvenate it
that's how you fix it from seed and that shit never got explained you know um and so i don't
you know there's when when anytime you have a situation where you know we can even go back
and take you know like ancient you know ancient virginia skunk bud grown for sssc or mr soul
you know working for sssc you know you you create these ancient legends and it's like how do you
disprove them yeah in a lot of cases you can't prove or disprove because they're so old well
let's get back to the forums i got a question yeah yeah um what was the first place do you
remember where the first like seed bank the first seed bank that carried your shit when people could
actually buy it which one was it well we don't talk about that okay so is it an unmentionable
i ain't friends with that guy anymore
my fault that dude a little loco yeah oh okay gotcha you gotta remember i didn't even uh
start my seed company until 2014 yeah yeah i remember yeah i i i could say one thing is that
my buddy that i never mentioned his name but staten island when we were doing all the super
dog work and we were doing all those hybrids that made it into the can of bible he had big
dreams of realizing that you could probably make more money like off of an eight lighter of seed
than you could off an eight lighter of flour and he saw what was coming i honestly didn't believe
him you know i didn't think i didn't think that we you would ever be able in america to like
package up and sell enormous amounts of seed or anything like that because at the time
we were making all this stuff and we were literally giving it away to good friends and
stuff because we had more than we knew what to do with and there wasn't an outlet for it
um you know the era that that caleb talks about getting involved is one of the earlier eras where
you could really actually start to sell it it wasn't simple in the beginning even even if you
were an active breeder finding out how to get it to the community wasn't very simple no at all you
had to trust i mean like even even with me i started the um selling seeds directly really
early for for a u.s person um but when i first started you still had to really put your trust
in someone in europe for the most part if you wanted any kind of traction for your seeds if you
wanted any i mean you had to work with seed banks for people they eventually know who you are the
seed bank didn't care you you probably weren't fucking important and that's the way everybody
looked at it we were about to go into csi after dark yeah yeah but yeah i mean uh you know a good
bit of that was in the 90s you know when dj short wanted to get his blueberry seed out there
he had to give it away to uh two different groups in europe yeah first he had to give it to tony at
sag martha and then he had to give it to dutch passion i don't know if he intentionally gave
it away but i think that's how it ended up working out i think he did huh didn't didn't he purposely
give them to him and make he purposely did i think he thought that he would still retain all control
and this and that that's where he was probably mistaken but in order for him to even like get
money for his seeds he had to send them to an established seed bank yeah in a different continent
that's how hard it was to move seeds then yeah but you know when he i think sag martha they had
his seeds and what like you know the mid 90s or something like that um uh right around there
the internet didn't even exist then really right right i did but not not on any level that you were
going to be able to use it for that yeah yeah i think overgrowth started in either 98 or 99
or yeah maybe yep no you're right about that so like the first forums the first being able to
exchange stuff like how would dj have even set up an internet was going to set up a geo cities like
fucking you know web page and sell illegal beans you know um i mean up until up until they passed
the the 215 and in late 96 i think it was it was it was illegal in all 50 states there wasn't any
there wasn't even a legitimate reason you could possess any of it yeah and i think he feels burnt
he felt burned but you know what were you going to do when you gave it away to the dutch right if
he didn't know that those those dutch guys were going to do whatever the fuck they wanted with it
then he was just he had just done his groundwork yeah right well yeah that that's a blueberry is
almost a a full day's topic just by itself it is but i just meant in the sense that like just to
use it on the example of how hard it was to sell seeds if you were a small american breeder
yeah he had to work with the dutch just to get it out there there wasn't an avenue what were you
going to do i mean you know um you know even like early even early american you know seed
sellers or whatever used to try to fake that their stuff was based out of europe right right
right you know i i mean one of the things that ig did and and the middle and and the sort of the
middle era of to middle late 215 was things opened up enough that people felt free to be
able to like you know you could have a swamp boys you could have a csi humble you could have a you
could have just these people that were like i'm going to make my own packaging i'm going to make
my own beans i'm going to go to these like gray area cannabis cup swap meets and hustle seeds i'm
going to start to mail um i can say back in 02030405 i mean my buddy from staten island
would tell me about this stuff that he wanted to do and i would laugh at him i was like oh you want
us to all go to jail because that's what that's what it seems like you're talking about to me
you know yeah when i started i i was one of the p i think i was one of the few people that
pretended that my website was in amsterdam just to like try to hide under the shadows you know
just because no one was doing it it's it fucking was a big red flag so even yeah i mean just waiting
for that hit even having the infrastructure set up to be successful yeah and and that's kind of why
there was so few breeders back then because it was generally done out of love and you were trading
amongst other people and there wasn't something like there is now where somebody can be like oh
i'm gonna drop my mac one drop and i'm gonna make 200 grand and you know i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm
gonna hype it yeah you really couldn't hype it there wasn't marketing there wasn't an ability
to reach a big audience right right i don't think you know no it took a while well and uh in in in
the era you know 06 you know through 08 even 2010 i mean most of the marketing most most of the
availability was all based on internet forums right yeah you know that was yeah and people
should also remember that when overgrowing cannabis world got shut down they got shut down because a
very big uh you know seed vendor got raided uh heaven stairway that was and that scared a bunch
of people and there's still repercussions and ripples hitting from that fucking bust you know
and you know and then you know and and you know and people even in canada and stuff like that you
know mark emory you know uh i mean he he went to fucking he went to jail you know it was it wasn't
any did you have any dealings with mark emory killer at all oh no no interactions no no interactions
at all but uh um you know i was getting uh cannabis culture or cannabis canada from pretty
much like the first issue you know i've always been a historian so i mean i have hundreds and
hundreds of cannabooks and i was you know for years i was getting every single magazine that
was put out on on everything so i've always been way more of a reader than a talker yeah you know
it helps put details together sometimes yeah it does yeah but no no no uh direct you know dealings
i mean uh the stuff i liked from from those magazines though and and him were like the abc
stuff from back yeah late 90s and then the purple indica purple kush stuff that was in those early
issues as well but uh and then emory was working with the same purple indica that's around now or
at least a relative uh it wasn't emory uh there was an article uh based out of snohomish county
oh okay in washington and it it basically dated that that stuff back into the you know at the
very least you know early mid 90s you know so there was a question we were talking about the
other night and i was like oh i need to ask not so that and i can't remember what it was
it had something to do with uh how did kim do you make it to california not so
oh yeah how did it make it here yeah who brought it oh that's that's pretty simple story so
uh it ties into the forums so people in 06 people started getting excited about uh kem dog
and the chem dog story because it started getting posted uh like um uh caleb was saying
shabba got uh got um skunk va to start posting about his you know recollections and different
stuff like that and and then you know that's kind of actually what started to reunite um
people like p bud and joe brand and uh chem dog all they all started chatting i believe they even
called like the the seeds that ended up being the one through four the reunion seeds or yeah
the number four they uh named the reunion fino specific reunion fino that's what it was right
because it was like they'd all they'd all kind of met up as this you know like different people
were like hey dude they're talking about your story on the internet right and so chem dog
hadn't actually had the chem 91 in quite a long time um he had gotten in trouble and lost it and
he had been working with some of the uh chem dog super skunk hybrids that he had and bag seed and
different things and when it got famous again he wanted it back uh but nobody had it so he got um
he got skunk he got skunk va to go back east with it and he was like if you bring it back to bring
it back to me and i've got this different one that you guys don't have out there and um i'll
give it to you so he went back east and and saw a dude and gave him the and gave him the dog and
then uh greg gave him the d and he came back and mommed it up and that's how uh me and uh ic
collective both got it so it was skunk va that did it brought it 100 oh cool and that was it
oh it's good on you skunk va it was him it was it was all it's he's the reason it's he to me
he's the reason it's on the west coast very cool uh he put forth the effort he went back east to
see chem dog uh he gave he gave the dog to chem dog he got the d that was and i think if i remember
too um uh i believe that um chem dog tried to give him back the mss yeah he just said that
but it was the shorter one that was in the high times and it wasn't what uh homie remembered at
all that makes a lot of sense too yeah so then yeah so then he came back and he grew it up into
a mom or whatever and then uh ic collective and myself got it not that long after that and
but to me it's like the reason it's on the west coast is is skunk va well on greg uh on g's tour
um he uh he he dropped it off uh in the you know la area with swerve the chem d in 06 but this is
off of 06 he um and swerve traded him a bunch of fake cuts for it you know no big deal and then he
also stopped at uh he stopped at um you know obsoletes and central cal um on his tour and
then he stopped at joe brands and then he headed up into oregon and stopped at some other folks
place and i think he might have given them the chem d too but he he stopped at a good handful of
places giving cuts out selling weed at dispensaries all that kind of stuff on his you know reunion
tour of sorts and this was like first week of august 06 so it sounds like uh skunk va went over
there you know earlier in the year and and and got the same or similar cut i don't know
seems like there was a few cuts that got passed out that year yeah yeah i mean it so but that's
that's kind of that's how that's how the and that led to a bunch of stuff that led to the
the one two three four getting popped and starting to get traded around right um that led to the d
that led to the one through the four and the d and all that starting to get added to the mix
um i don't know that the weird thing about the the chem stuff is that my buddy disliked the cis
quite a bit he thought it was ugly and he didn't like how it got him high so he never brought it
west and so it never really percolated around our crew um you know we way later we saw some of the
s1s um but not the actual not the actual first one you know yeah so but yeah i mean that's and i
you know i'm pretty sure uh you know he i i never lost i never lost it after skunk gave it to me
um yeah i mean that and that's that's the kind of thing like you know uh csi and i talk about
it all the time it's like are there strains where like the chain of custody wasn't broken
right right because once you lose the chain of custody um you know it's hard
it gets hard you know like um because who knows you know you try to you you lost the sour diesel
you try to get it back it's not the same thing you remember you lost this you try to get it back
it's not the same you remember um you know so on and so forth so you know kind of like when a 707
shabba got his bubba back from me um i i don't think i did it on purpose it was an accident it
got mixed up in a flat what because i was bringing a ton of people a bunch of stuff
at a party and uh then like a year later he's like yeah inspectors bubba and i was like what's
this inspector's buff and he had bomb threat and not oh shit not but i was like my bad my bad
i ain't trying to give you you know the fake that's one well not fake but you know yeah
but yeah that happens all the time i think i'd take a bomb threat over over original maybe you
can always get a new bomb threat if you have that that's true that's true it's a good point
you know here's a question for you since uh we've kind of meandered away from the forum stuff but
do you csi do you do any work with gisa are you planning any work with it
maybe maybe if i could find a mass super skunk yeah yeah that was for you too really
yeah i was telling him last night that i think he should because i think it's a it's a rad clone but
it is it is very finicky and it does make it a lot harder to to pull off reversals on unhappy
finicky shit right it would it would be really cool to kind of uh attempt to remake like uh
a sour type from yeah you know building blocks i mean yeah you know we all have the the 91
but you know what building blocks you know it might not have to be the exact thing but
what could you get close enough to to make a sour diesel out of you know the original building
blocks yeah you know i think i think gisa leans closer to a sour type than it does a chem type
personally oh yeah definitely definitely yeah i think so it's a cool one yeah yeah all right so
people want to hear something about irene i don't know what they want to hear about irene i think
we've already told the story of irene but do you have any good irene tales oh i don't know i mean
she's cool i think um i i had irene for a little bit um and didn't realize she was
she was you know as as nice as she was until i think i grew her outdoors uh in maybe 2008
i'm thinking yeah i don't want to fudge the fudge the dates though um but yeah she came out so nice
back then you know good old-fashioned atlanta atlanta's finest yeah it is a special one yeah
i mean it doesn't have a whole whole lot of a story you know yeah just another another bag
seat really that's what it all boils down to is just another fucking bag seat i mean that is one
of the most humbling things about breeding is that a lot of the most famous strains are total accidents
right and you put a bunch of time and work and effort into stuff and then you know your air
conditioner goes out and some shit herms and the seed off of that is better than anything you tried
to do and i think a lot of times when it comes to like these stories the the accidental weed is so
good it's what makes people want to try to like shoehorn in that they had some intentional part
of making it not so much that i was just there or we got late they don't want to say well i just got
lucky in my room they want to be like oh well i did this and i did this and i did this and then
that happened and yeah now it's all the weed that you all want well everybody's got to work their
stud isn't that how it's done you know but but really it was more like you know i was i had my
room i ended up partying for a few days i fucked off i walked in there there was some bananas i
found some seeds trimming that's like 99 of bag seed stories yeah that that's kind of why i believe
matt matt burger and josh d story because it's not impressive it's not a it it's a
herm you know in a little closet under the stairs story and it's just like who makes that stuff up
that's not right that's just oops yeah i mean you know i it it that's very humbling but i i also do
think that a lot of that 90s weed it just goes to show that when you're crossing things that
like aren't when you're crossing real fire you know right um it's a lot easier to get you know
like was was neville an amazing breeder or do you just get to get the best of the best from america
and cross it together for the first time right right you know what i'm saying there's an there's
an there's arguments to both he was right you know he was the first person to cross nl and skunk
right you know huh not so what are you saying i'm rude no uh no uh i was thinking you should get uh
tom on and try to get uh uh figure out a little more details about pine tar and all that kind of
stuff because love to you know i don't think he even knows who i am to get him on or he's not
likely i i think he's banned off ic mag so uh yeah i mean let me ask you like a real question do you
think that he would be better for a live or do you think he would be better for a a lightly edited
uh podcast or something oh probably a heavily edited podcast you're right because i mean we
definitely matt and i have definitely interviewed some like knowledgeable old timers right and like
yeah no it's not tom's the character i like him but man he'll yeah
he's right off topic yeah you know yeah so there's there is a question everybody is asking and it's up
to you if you want to talk about i don't even know if you want to deal with this one right now or
save it for a full episode caleb back story on z what do you think oh man um i don't want to like
say say yet because yeah let's say you want to save it for a full show of some sort later well
i i still have some groans to do on that whole thing but yeah man i i wouldn't be surprised if
it's not just an s1 of of that green sherbert cut yeah um there's there's just too too many
similarities and the whole you know uh heterozygous homozygous thing between the two of them
really kind of leans towards it just being a s1 of that yeah but i don't know um
yeah i could go on and on on some comparisons on you know how some of that stuff could uh
could potentially make sense um yeah but i don't know i don't know yeah we'll save it for another
time but yeah no that's a that's a good answer one thing one thing that is cool uh about that is that
csi and i and matt we all talk all the time about how when you compare stories
stories to what the plants tell you uh how they breed what their s1s look like um what what they
look like when they get crossed to different things and how what your eyes tell you lines
up with what the story is right right right you know and sometimes it it sometimes it adds a lot
in terms of what you see um you know like about i have a i have a really hard time believing
that the the the cis the 91 the chem d and the one through four all came out of the same bud
yeah yeah you know um they're just too vastly different to me um you know but that's i wasn't
there either you know and a lot of this stuff is like the most famous stories they almost because
almost all of them come from accidents and because a lot of them come from other people it's like the
people that marketed stuff or marketed skittles or marketed cookie or whatever
like they probably you know different people get it maybe it doesn't get quite as famous
you know um you know and they should get great credit for marketing it to the point that they did
yeah right oh yeah i'm 100 percent that i've never disputed that um you know i i give lots of people
accolades for mark successfully marketing and you know building you know clones that would never
have been anything up you know to what they are uh what i've always you know frown on of course is
you know people being dishonest doing it i think you can do it honestly and still be successful
sure you know having to just make a big old big old you know fictitious backstories or act like
you're the one responsible for it that's why instead of you know i mean there's cats like
you know josh and matt who are like oh yeah it was a harm accident under the stairs and then there's
other cats you know who are like yes we created that from our multi-thousand plant grows aren't
we awesome yes yes we popped we popped 15 seeds and the 20th was the best yeah so you know um
you know i i think the the truth is is the the biggest factor for me yeah yeah there's an aspect
where and you know we should say this too is that truth is a most people everyone likes to say they
want the truth but like people that really care about it it's like a really small percentage
yeah oh most people like truth if it helps them burnish their money or their reputation or
whatever else sure and the truth is usually boring you know people who are looking for
excitement from the truth they're gonna be like oh well that was lame yeah something up i don't care
especially when the answer is 99 of the time oh it's a bad seed yeah or yeah or you know or it
happened in an accident at my buddy's house or i said this or i was you know like you know you
are early involved and you know the story even just knowing the story is cool right but then
people want to be part like they want to be this active component that was critical to the story
you know right and i did forget someone earlier that was really important when i was was you know
coming in and that was that was doing reversals before i was and that was rascal i think i think
i would be remiss not to mention him because he was doing good things and had legitimate cuts you
know for the most part uh as far as i know like he was doing good fucking work and he was doing it
at a time when it wasn't popular when people were pushing back against feminized seed so i give that
guy props to all the stuff that that guy made between whatever it was oh nine and twelve or
whatever yeah all those hybrids are fire yeah there was some good shit in there i mean he really
i'm not maybe not all but like the vast majority of the stuff he had some really nice cuts and he
was crossing them together and they led to some really nice things yeah i mean white fire you know
a lot of people don't even know like about the white anymore like not a lot of people talk about
it but that was the essence behind the white fire that was fucking cool right right yep that uh
that's one i'd like to touch on too in the future um oh yeah they they uh you know the swamp boys uh
big ricky in particular he uh he's alluded a lot to knowing exactly what the hybrid of the white is
because it's supposedly a tk hybrid um but you know he he likes riddles and secrets so
speaks in riddles and lyrics i call it a haiku hillbilly haiku oh there he likes sometimes i
wonder how long he takes to craft uh some of his instagram posts and how to make it like you know
he because he's got his own language when it comes to that you know have you seen have you seen stuff
like the white inside the tks ones yeah yeah yeah there there was a there was one plant in our first
run of them where um actually there was there was there was four plants that uh we pulled out of the
first run um and uh one was a green girl scout cookie like a green form cut um other was a plant
that looked just like the white you know not oh but so similar yeah it was obvious and then there
was the number 50 and the 51 were which were my two actual favorites of the whole bunch and then
you know i i smoked both those heavily and the 50 turned out to be my absolute favorite of the
whole bunch and so that's the one i kept and still play with from the first and then i did another
hundred plus you know tks one pop and you know got other selections from there yeah
so caleb what do you think about cookies uh great question for when asked what do you think
what do you think uh i think that uh goes into the category of 2000 uh what 2010 and on for 2010
2011 yeah people people ask a bunch of that and i think i mean it's a story you know and it's a
story that like there's a lot of pieces that aren't known that well um but it's a definitely
it's you know it's a super popular brand there's a lot of money involved there's a lot of rep
involved and it's one of those things if you don't get it exactly right there it's going to be gunning
for you here's a relevant one here's a relevant one for you caleb are you gonna s1 any of the nl
selections i was gonna leave that up to you buddy yeah i think we might i think we might
i'm gonna see how it goes uh yeah no i i think they'd be worth it i think they'd do that
you know i like my feminized so i'll grow some of matt's uh s1 nls hell yeah
there we go well we've kept him here for god damn a long time so i know he's got a busy night i got
to get back to packing um anything else anybody wants to talk about
awesome so what are you so what's what's the next drop caleb and where where can we find it
oh i don't know if i'm dropping dead maybe yeah the next drop is dead
i'm i'm good for now yeah okay well go check out humbled csi.com correct
yeah yeah humbled csi.com keep your eyes peeled he's always putting stuff up on there
on and off he doesn't often announce it so just keep checking back um i'm still waiting
for those next drop what's that i'm still waiting on not so's next drop yeah where the fuck's that
not so it's slowly developing okay good it's slowly developing through you know i'm not that
i'm not that public of a guy uh it's changing though you know thanks both of you uh basically
like if if the two most important people for you guys seeing my face on a weekly basis is the two
people on this uh talk tonight guaranteed without them i would not be showing my face or chatting
about stuff they both pushed for quite a long time to get me to tell stories and talk shit
um so really it it really is they gave me the confidence to say you people would want to hear
it let's chat let's talk history and you know and there's an aspect to it too where it's like
a lot of this stuff we're talking about with you guys this is what we have all been doing amongst
each other privately for fucking ever yeah so we've all heard each other's stupid funny stories
so we've all heard each other's stupid fucking stories 100 times you know and and all that and
so this is this is really how information gets information and cuts get saved and and shared
and you know history survives and generally the point of all this is to get you know versions of
history out there and gets passed along right yep so other newer people can hear it so it's it's
just not a wash in bullshit and everyone keep your eyes peeled for a sterling's uh what is it
sterling green drop eventually yeah eventually eventually eventually when it when it comes
around everybody's asking about it so i figured i'd plug it and there's a bunch of good questions
today we didn't get to uh as always if just because just because you asked and we didn't chat
um you know doesn't mean it's not it's not worthwhile you can always message us about them
we're always looking for different things to chat about what people have interest in
so keep all that stuff coming we always appreciate you guys this friday night
100 so yep super and go go check out the breeder syndicate patreon you got to go to google type in
