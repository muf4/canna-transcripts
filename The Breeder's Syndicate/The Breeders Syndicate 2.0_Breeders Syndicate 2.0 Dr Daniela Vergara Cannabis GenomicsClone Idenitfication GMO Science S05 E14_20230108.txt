Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate, where we explore the history of a clandestine scene
through the eyes of the folks who lived it.
I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host NotSoJawed, breeder and grower from Mendocino.
Welcome to the underground.
Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
We're here today with Dr. Daniela Vergara.
She received her bachelor's in microbiology from Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, 2006,
and her PhD in ecology, evolution, behavior, minor in genetics from Indiana University,
Bloomington.
She is an emerging crop specialist at Cornell University and a research associate and lecturer
at the university and a postdoc at Colorado in Boulder, starting 2013 in cannabis.
Is that correct?
Yeah, I started as a postdoc in CU Boulder in 2013, and then I became a research associate
in 2018.
But yes, I started researching cannabis in 2013 at CU Boulder.
That's perfect.
So I reached out to you because, you know, going through looking at a lot of the science
that's been done, whether it's by larger organizations that have worked with breeders
and collected, you know, DNA and data, I've noticed that there is a big falling out or
maybe a disconnect in communication between maybe some of the people that are more serious
in the traditional cannabis market versus the academic cannabis world.
And I feel like there's a big disconnect.
So I reached out to you and I was like, hey, let's talk.
Like, I don't know that anybody's talking.
You seem really super cool and you actually care.
So like, I wanted to talk to you and I thought, what better way to do it here and like maybe
record it and for posterity and see if we can get anywhere and what we can learn from
each other.
So thank you so much for showing up and sitting down and doing this.
Most people wouldn't, you know, not it's not a big show yet.
Oh, thank you.
I appreciate it.
And, you know, to be honest, I don't think that there is a disconnect between the academic
world and the science academic cannabis world and the cannabis world in general.
I think that academics are disconnected from the world, period.
You know, like I think that in general, there is a disconnect between what happens in academia
and what happens in real life and what real life people get.
So in general, not just in cannabis, but overall.
So I think that you are totally spot on on what you just said.
So one of the first things we talked about was how genetics work out, what we see, what
we don't see.
But I figured with our show, I wanted to define some of these terms that we're going to be
using and who better to help me define them than someone that's working with the breeding
program at Cornell.
So we talk about phenotypes a lot in cannabis in generally using the term.
And the way I learned the term was phenotypes are like the observable traits, the physical
observable traits and genotypes are the genes that underlie those physical observable traits.
Is that correct?
Correct.
So when we use the term phenotypes, we are referring to the observable traits.
And so people understand there are genes underlying those observable traits, which are the actual
genotypes.
Am I pronouncing that correctly?
Is there anything I'm missing out, though?
So in general, a phenotype you can measure somehow.
So a phenotype could be height that you can measure using a meter stick or weight or in
cannabis is cannabinoids that you can measure using an HPLC or a GC machine.
So a phenotype you can measure somehow with a tool.
And genes need a gene mapping tool of some sort or measuring tool.
Or sequence.
You need to sequence for you to see the letters of the DNA in order to figure out the gene.
So in general, the DNA has four letters.
And those four letters are repeated in the genome in different amounts, etc.
You can quantify like there's a thing that you can quantify the number of G's or C's.
It's G, C, A and T. So the number of G's, C's in your genomic content.
You can quantify that.
But yes, so you need in order to figure out a gene, you need to sequence that gene.
There's many different ways for you to be able to sequence that.
It's kind of like transcribe the gene in order to figure out the specific letters of the
gene.
But you can.
It's a much more complicated process.
You know, like I can measure your height easily.
And if you are measuring the height or the number of leaves or the number of nodes of
a plant, you can do that fairly easily.
But in order for you to take the DNA out, so you need to do a DNA extraction and then
you need to take that DNA extraction into a facility that sequence it for you.
So it's a much more complex methodology.
Yeah, possible.
You know, we do it.
Yeah.
So is this what you do at Cornell?
Are you working at the gene level on the plants?
No, at Cornell, I'm actually part of the extension.
So I'm at Cornell Cooperative Extension.
So I'm actually working with farmers and the cannabis industry in general and the hemp
industry.
So cannabis at all levels.
Right.
So for mostly for for grain and for fiber and for cannabinoids that are not THC because
THC, it's still federally regulated as academic institutions.
We cannot work with high THC, but we do work with other cannabinoids, which is kind of
like a similar thing, right?
What you do to enhance CBD, you do to enhance THC.
So I do work with with I do go to to facilities and to work with growers and breeders.
And yeah.
So you're from Colombia.
What was the attitude in Colombia like growing up for a young lady, you know, just an average
young lady where you grew up?
Was it was it positive?
Was it negative?
When I grew up?
So I grew up during a very violent time.
I think that Colombia has never not had a violent time.
Yeah.
But I grew up during the narco time.
Yeah.
And it was a very violent time.
And yeah, so so that at that time, they were putting bombs in discos and bars.
And my hometown, Cali, Colombia is was the hub of a big cartel cartel.
So so it was I mean, I remember my teenage years and very fondly and I had a lot of fun
with friends and I would go out dancing.
But I do remember my parents, my mom, my mom is kind of graphic with her language.
She would say things like, I don't care if you're with a guy.
I just want to know where you are.
Because if there is a bomb, I want to know where I'm going to pick up the leftovers of
my daughter.
Wow.
Yes, that's real.
That's very real.
Yeah, it was a little bit more descriptive.
I'm sure.
More descriptive than what I just said.
But yeah, and there were I mean, I do have very graphic, gruesome memories of what was
ongoing in the country.
So so that was, you know, I did grow up in a medium, high income, a household.
My dad is a university professor.
My mom is an attorney.
They're both retired types now.
But but I did grow up in a very intellectual type of family.
We still talk politics on the table.
Yeah.
Which coming to the US was weird for me.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Why are you voting for that person?
You know, like asking questions, you know, just right, like not not not in a bad way.
But tell me what is that person offering that I should vote for that person?
Sure.
So especially talking about elections that are coming tomorrow.
Yeah, it's very restrained here.
It's like you have to be because you don't know who's leaning which way and it's especially
now the country is very divided, super divided.
In Colombia as well, especially with the last president, whom I am kind of proud that that
guy got elected, Gustavo Petro.
Not because I think he's perfect.
Like I don't think any politician is perfect.
I disagree with 99 percent of everything.
I disagree with the choices I made this morning.
Yeah, right.
Right.
Yeah.
I'm the most intolerant person in this world, you know, like five feet two of intolerance.
But but I, I do think that Petro offers a difference.
He offers something that has never been in Colombia.
You know, Colombia has always been an oligarchy.
Colombia has always been a minority that has ruled the country.
And then after particular presidents before now, the oligarchy is the owner of the cocaine
exports.
Right.
Like we have to be honest as Colombians about it, that coca is the biggest export in Colombia.
Right.
That's the country's main export.
Yeah.
Yes.
Right.
Yeah.
It's emeralds and bananas.
Yeah.
But realistically, we know where the majority of the money is coming from.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we cannot just be, you know, like, yeah, it's it's real.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
So with that in mind, you know, I think that Gustavo Petro comes with like, hey, the war
on drugs have not worked.
He gave a speech at the United Nations a month ago or so that I recommend for everyone.
I almost cried because he said it out loud like, hey, this hasn't worked and we need
to change things and we need to try something new.
I mean, we already know that the money that Americans have given us to stop the coca plantations
that has only brought violence and it doesn't work.
So let's try to do something new.
So I think that or something different.
And I think that that was really important.
And he is now looking to I mean.
Medical marijuana has been legalized in Colombia and now they're looking for recreational marijuana.
And to be honest, I think that all drugs, quote unquote, should be legal.
I mean, we still don't have a clear definition of what is a drug.
Yeah.
You know, chocolate is a drug.
Coffee is a drug.
Exactly.
Yeah.
So there are so many things that are drugs that are intoxicants that could be addicting
and that even aren't that aren't even necessarily affecting your central nervous system that
could be addicting in other ways.
You know what I mean?
Like so.
Yeah.
That's not clearly defined.
And so you get that pleasure hit from all kinds of different things, you know, and that
could drive all kinds of factors in their life that could be positive or negative.
It's really open ended that the way they've left it.
And I think anybody who's especially politicians, any any politician that's willing to look
at the war on drugs, the negative effects it's had on everyone, the way it's driven
Americans like privatized prisons, everything.
It's crazy.
So, yeah, I'm all for anybody pushing for just total abolishment of illegal, like the
idea of illegal drugs, the idea of it.
I completely agree.
Now, I think that maybe you and I are being utopic, you know, like I don't know.
Probably.
Yeah, probably.
You know, we know that Oregon, for example, has these laws that they legalized a bunch
of different drugs.
Portugal, right, as a country did as well.
Colorado right now has seen the ballot psilocybin.
So it is happening in some places.
But I do think that that I asking for for total legalization.
There are many big players that are benefiting from mass incarceration.
Oh, sure.
The wars in drugs, like the wars in drugs have been very successful for some people.
Yeah, sure.
Military contracts galore.
So yeah.
Yeah.
So when you grew up, I assume because it was like narco wars where you grew up, was the
attitude of your parents like more down on cannabis?
Like you cannot we do not want to see you using cannabis or were they more open minded
on it?
So my parents have always been kind of the hippies of their families in a way.
Even though, you know, I again, my family has always been kind of in academia and that
stuff.
My dad is a physics professor and I grew up going to his university studying music.
I had music lessons there when I was a child.
So I've always grown up in a university environment.
I've never in my life ever left the university.
Could you believe that?
That's crazy.
It is crazy.
I've just changed, you know, different university from different places in Colombia or in the
US.
But I've always been on a sort of campus.
Wow.
That is wild.
I mean, to surround yourself with education like that, though, it's got to be your passion
to constantly learn.
Yeah.
But as I told you, I'm an intolerant human being.
I have my big fights with academia every single day and with bureaucracy every single day.
And the way, you know, like I have my big fights about I don't believe in the education
system.
I think that it's, again, benefiting a tiny minority.
I don't think that this thing that Biden is proposing about student loan, I think it
should pass.
Don't get me wrong.
But I think that that is just a little bandaid.
Right.
Oh, sure.
Sure.
It's better than nothing, but it is not solving the problem.
I think that all of these academic institutions, some more than others, and because I've been
in the US, I've been in three now.
I kind of know a little bit about them and I have academic friends all over.
So I kind of know how they work.
But these academic institutions are profiting out of the most vulnerable side of the population,
which are 20 year olds.
They are benefiting a minority of administrators who do not care about the education.
And in general, I feel that professors, especially those in tenure track positions, are just
there kind of like, oh, well, you know, what can we do?
Oh, well, yeah, I see a lot of that with tenure, like in any any sort of like teaching profession,
whether it's like elementary school all the way to university.
It's the same thing.
Once they get that, it's just like, hmm.
Yeah, exactly.
You got there and you're sitting down.
No one can fire you.
Yeah.
It takes an act of God.
Exactly.
Exactly.
That is that is a good descriptor.
It takes an act of God to fire a tenure track professor and they can do despicable things,
you know, like harassment, sexual harassment.
And they're still in this tenure track job.
And so anything can happen.
They're not going to fight for their students or few of them are going to fight for the
students.
There's some, right.
Like, I cannot put all of these people in the same bag.
In general, they don't fight for the students.
They don't fight for changes.
They don't fight for, you know, more funding towards benefiting their labs.
They're just there and no one no one's going to fire them and they have a secure pension.
Right.
Yeah.
So so I that's one of my fights with academia is kind of like this lethargic states of the
tenure track professors.
Yeah, I think that's a lot of people that are my friends in academia.
I think that's the one thing that they have the most trouble with, especially if they're
vocal.
You know, a lot of people will take it on the chin and just try to go with it and try
to work within that system.
But like my personality, I'm one of those personalities where like I have no filter.
So it just comes out.
So I don't know if I last in that.
And I see you're kind of similar.
So I wonder how that goes for you.
Well, um, so when I was in CU Boulder, I'm still at CU Boulder as a lecturer.
I'm still in as a researcher.
But when I was there in Colorado, I was in Colorado for eight years.
I was part of the union.
I am a total union proponent.
I feel that in a perfect world, you shouldn't have unions because people should not need
to unionize against, right?
Like, yeah, if people weren't greedy, you wouldn't need a union.
But people are.
Yeah, exactly.
If people weren't, you know, if there weren't like Elon's and Jeff's around.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then, then that you should have health care.
Like you should have should be normal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It should be a given.
You should have parental leave.
You should.
Right.
But because these things are not the norm, then you should unionize.
And unfortunately, so I was part of the union and I was very vocal about it.
And there were some people that did not like it.
And then, you know, like I am a big proponent of free speech.
You can say whatever you want.
I also have the right to not follow you on Twitter.
Yeah.
Yeah, totally.
I don't have the right to tell you, Matthew, shut up.
No, you can say it.
But I do have the right to, you know, quote my ears.
Yeah.
And adults should be able to like make that decision.
I don't like this.
You know what I mean?
Like that should be an easy decision.
Like, I'm a big proponent of the block.
Yeah.
And, you know, I think I'm a big proponent of social media, too.
I'm a big supporter of social media.
And I think the fact that I can feature on all social media, it makes life so much better
because like I don't I don't if someone doesn't like me and they're going to say mean things
about me, I'm not going to sit there and like dwell on it.
And I'm like, well, OK, cool.
Like I don't have to see it ever again.
You don't have to see me.
We're cool.
Life goes on.
You know?
Yeah, exactly.
Like, I can just mute you.
There's that option for a reason.
Yeah, it's a great option.
Cannabis happened.
I mean, I've always been a pothead.
We moved to Colorado.
I'm out of that closet
after Women Grow,
you know, after I was in a Women Grow
event and I was in the first
cohort of Women Grow. So when
Women Grow started back in
2014 with Jane West
and Julie
Bakewitz and Hazmina Aguiar and
I was part
of that and it completely opened
my head. I was coming from
my PhD
which I was talking
nerd to other nerds
and then I went
into a completely different
world in cannabis and for me when I started
working in cannabis it was a plant that I was going
to be studying, the genome.
I was really interested in the male and female
thing in cannabis.
I was going to start very academic
and then I get into this
industry that for me
was like, what
the hell? This is an industry, an entire
industry where you have lawyers and you
have accountants
and you have designers and
you have every... and so for...
it was like, what?
Is this a marketer?
First time in my life that I met a marketer
like, what do you... what?
So it was completely
mind-blowing
and then
when I was in this Women Grow
Events,
I'm a biologist, I was a field biologist
for a long time, field biologist, rubber
boot type of field biologist
and so when I got there
and I see all of these women, you know,
lipstick and high heels
with a joint,
it blew my mind.
Oh, I
was a hippie, kind of
flip-flop type of thing, you know, rubber
boot with a joint and then you see
these women that are
super accomplished, super accomplished
economists,
finance, financial
analysts and
after that I was, I am leaving
this closet.
Yeah, yeah.
And so
yeah, so the cannabis industry
opened my
scientific sphere
and my, I guess my
my
professional and personal
life completely opened it.
Yeah.
So when you first started smoking,
when did you first start realizing
that, because I mean
the conversation is never going to go one place, when did you
first start noticing that maybe
like there was inconsistency
between what you would get at
a dispensary
between strains that they would assure
you were the same thing, meaning, you know,
a lot of people go into dispensaries,
they expect a certain medical effect from whatever
certain strain they buy and they want to rely
on that medical effect for whatever reason.
When did you start noticing any kind of inconsistency
or any of that
in cannabis?
I'm gonna
be honest
and I hope that your listeners do not
hate me. No,
no they won't. They're good peeps.
They're good people. Okay.
My palate
is either yes or
no and it's usually yes.
You know, in general with food
I am a
very good eater. I just
don't eat, you
know, junk food but in general
everything tastes good
except for maybe cauliflower without cheese
but, right?
Cannabis is the same
thing for me. You know, like
I'm high or not high. There are
differences between, oh this one
really made it very cerebral
or this one really gave me
a couch lock or
this one just, you know,
made me, like I am
completely doing stuff, right?
Yeah. Very active.
So that is a difference
but in terms of anything else
plus I have a volcano and when
you have a volcano and you
vaporize it that way, kind of like
the smell and all of that is lost.
Yeah.
So I really
thought
that all of the cannabinoids and terpenes
and all of this was
just
you know, potheads
saying stuff. Yeah, like
a lot of people look at wine, or whatever
they call it, sommeliers.
Yeah. So I thought that that
was kind of BS until
I analyzed data.
For me it was data that changed
my mind when I started analyzing
cannabinoids and terpenes
and the amount and the distribution
and the diversity and this
one has one and not the other. Then
I was like, oh this is for real.
Like this plant, this is for real
and all of these smells and
so there's been multiple studies throughout the
years that just
corroborate that I just have
a terrible pelt. Yeah.
And that's a for real thing and what you're
describing to me is like
with my wife, she smoked when she was young
like a bunch but she didn't really ever get
into like, oh I'm going to smoke this, strain that. She didn't
care, like she was just getting weed, whatever.
So once we got together
I'd say, yeah
this is X kind of blueberry
it's this, this and this and she's looking
at me and she's like, I smell weed.
What are you talking about?
And it's taken until probably
the last year to where her palate's
finally getting, oh I see what you're
saying now. But it takes a
long, long time
and constant really getting
into it to develop that.
And an effort, right? So now when I
go to grows, for example, I usually
what I do is that I rub the plant
with my fingers and then I smell my fingers
but there is indeed
some that smell
like skunk.
There is indeed some
that smell like lemon.
There are others
that smell more forestry,
right? Like more, and there's definitely
the pine thing and then when you
look at the chemotypes in
the studies that I've done and then you see
oh there is indeed a terpene
called pine and there's this other one
beta-cryophyllene and there's, okay
so that makes sense.
So this is not a lie.
Right? So yeah, so
now and recently
I got
something that smelled really, really
skunky and I was like, oh
man, this is really skunky and there
is a skunk that lives around my
house and I smelled it and
I was like, I get it.
Yep. Like, I get it.
You finally made the scent connection
in your brain to the smell and
everything, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I get
it and so in that sense
but yeah, but in terms of, you
know, I really like, there was one
strain that we could get in Colorado
a long time ago that was around
20, yeah, 2013, 14, 15
which was this tangerine
haste. Okay, I know
exactly what you're talking about. That I love.
I have friends in Colorado growing
it so I know exactly what it is. Yeah.
Yeah.
But other than that
I also like edibles.
So you
like really, do you like the fact
that, I mean, do you like edibles that are
super strong and will lay you out for hours
or do you like the ones that are more calm
and not as strong?
So I
always have
THC CBD together
right? So something that has both
but
I like whatever
gives me energy to do
house chores because I do not
understand how people
do house chores
how do they vacuum and
sweep and clean a bathroom while
sober. Yeah, I don't
you got me on that one. I'm right
there with you. Like to be motivated
to do that while you're sober
I mean, yeah. Exactly, like what are you
going to do today? I'm going to clean the
toilet. Woo, yeah.
Exactly. No, I need, you know
so I take the cookie and
then recently a friend of mine gave
me these cookies that have delta
8. Okay.
Yeah. And this delta
8, I love it, you know, and I love the
chemistry behind it, the biochemistry
because all of these
compounds, the differences where you
have these double bonds, the carbon
so delta 9
you have the double bond between
two carbons, between carbons
8 and 9 and
then delta 8 you have the double
bond between carbons 7 and 8
so it's, I
like that kind of like, okay, why
is it called this way besides chemistry
has always been
difficult subject for
me. I do not understand chemistry
like, yeah, I get it
like it doesn't come naturally like I
really have to read and
so
he gave me this delta 8 cookies
and for me those delta 8 cookies I am
super active for
3 hours and then
or 4 hours max
and then I just fall asleep
and it's like falling asleep
I could be sitting
in the table and then
and I just, I'm
done. It's so
amazing how different
like the cannabis chemistry affects
everyone's different brain chemistry
vastly different and it could even be like
beginning of the day, smoking
the same exact strain, the same amount
you know, like will make you feel completely different
than at night sometimes. It's
wild and it's taken me
so many years to understand the
variance even between clones
like that's something
a lot of breeders in cannabis
like the past several years like
haven't really even come to that conclusion or
understanding yet like
I'll often have people message me and be like
hey I have this clone I bought it at a
dispensary. I want to know if this
is the old clone that you and your group remember
from you know 20 years ago
so I'll say one
I can't identify anything by
pictures and they'll be like why?
I don't get it. Well because it may grow
very differently in your room than it does in the other
room and people don't get how vast
that difference can be. It can be
I tried to explain with the UK cheese
I've had it turn out super blueberry fruity
and look you know a little short
and stout all the way to a very
lanky tall very what people
would consider typically sativa plant that's
foot funk cheese and it's
the same clone. So can you talk
about some of the genetic
reasons behind that variance?
Yeah that's super
interesting that you mentioned that.
So any physical
characteristic which a physical
characteristic is a phenotype anything
that you can measure somehow
it's a product of
genes and the environment.
There are some physical
traits that are more genetically
dependent. There are others that are more
environmentally dependent and I'm
going to give you the same two
examples that I always give
and I hope that if people have been in my
talks before I'm sorry
for repeating myself
but human
height is highly
genetically
heritable right?
It's very genetic so if your parents
are tall it's likely that you're going to be tall
if your parents are short it's likely that you're
going to be short. It's 80%
heritability so that 20%
is environment and that 20%
is usually what you ate while you were
growing up right?
You had good nutrition you may
achieve that
potential height right?
If you had poor nutrition you may not but it's
80% genetics
basically. There are other
traits like weight
which also has a
genetic component. There are some people that are
more prone to be you know a little
bit thicker than other people
however if you
eat a particular diet
you're more prone to have more
weight or less weight. You can control
the amount.
Yes it's more environmental
than it right?
It's the same thing with
these clones.
If you're growing the same clone
in a completely different environment
you can have
what you just said you can have a completely
different plant
particularly because we know
that cannabis for example is
very photosensitive.
Yes. So if you
have very good lights
it's more
likely that you're going to produce more cannabinoids
and that your plant is probably going to be
happier than if you have
fewer lights. If you put your
plant
in a closet in the basement with
no lights
probably it's going to die.
Yes.
So that environment
is very important.
What we don't know
is of these cannabinoids
and terpenes this complex
it's a very complex phenotype
it's a very complex phenotype
that involves multiple
genes acting in unison.
So there's this
Jordan Sager who's
the CEO of
Dewey Scientific in Washington State.
He has a paper
with who was his postdoc
advisor Mark Lange
in Washington State in Pullman
and they have this paper that I really like
where they talk about all
of the genes related to cannabinoids
and terpene production as a network
of genes kind of acting together.
I think it's a really good description
right? So what we in biology
called epistasis which is
kind of like two genes acting
on a particular phenotype and
pleiotropy which is two different
phenotypes that are controlled one by one
gene so we have this pleiotropic
and this epistatic effects acting
in unison for this very complex
phenotype. However
we don't know how much
of it is environmentally determined
and how much is
genetics.
We know that there is a genetic component
for sure.
But we don't know how much. We don't know if it's going
to be like weight or is it going to be
like height in humans.
And the
experiments for you to figure
that out are quote unquote
simple. You just need to have
several generations or
you can do for example
the same clone in different environments and
then measure it right?
But yeah
I agree with what you said to your friend
is this
blue cheese?
I don't know. Maybe.
Maybe it could be. It looks
like it. It could be a
mother to it. It could be a
hybrid of it or it could be something that just
totally expresses similar and not related
to it whatsoever because cannabis is wild and
plastic like that. It has plasticity.
And the other thing
is that we know
that
there is a lot of diversity. There is a
lot of genomic diversity. So in the
genome all of the conglomerate
of DNA of the plant right? All of the
letters of the DNA. We know that it's
very diverse. It's
three to four times
as diverse as humans.
Oh wow. Yeah. It's
very very diverse. So
if you have that amount of diversity
you can have
you can have a lot of diversity
in your progeny right? Yes.
So full sibs
may be completely different
to each other. Yeah. And
therefore you know
probably this chem
dog number one and chem dog number four
which were probably full
sibs that's why they're completely
different phenotypes. Yes.
And reason why
it makes sense for you
to clone the plants
because when you're cloning them
then you're assuring that
they're going to be more similar to the mother
plant than if
you have seeds. Yes.
But that's why I think that
we need really good breeding
in cannabis
in marijuana right? Because in
hemp it's happening
and you know cannabis is hemp
and marijuana. Yeah. But
in hemp it's happening for
grain and for fiber
and Europe has done
some good job at breeding
and China as well. But
for marijuana
I think that we need to have good breeding
and good breeding for particular locations
because especially if you're growing outdoors
because Campbell County California
has a very different
environment than upstate
New York. Sure. Or than
Colorado right? So if you're growing outdoors
I think that you need to have
really good breeding and I hope that
that happens in cannabis
or I know that it is happening.
Sure. Yeah it's
been happening for years but
the ratio of people doing that kind
of work to the people just putting
something on the market to make money
is very low. Like the amount
of people doing serious breeding work versus
I'm going to cross this to this
and see what happens because the names are
cool you know and putting it out on the market.
There's a lot of that now and that's
typically what we see in the breeding
market. I
think so. I think
that there are very reputable
companies in California.
I know one company
from Colorado like Trilogy
and Seeds. I think that they're good
at what they do for example as breeding.
But it is not easy.
It is time consuming.
And I do agree with you that the naming thing
is well we know that the naming
convention is
just BS right?
We know that
Sativa, Indica, Hybrid
they do not mean much.
Especially when you're trying to
group traits like this is Sativa
because it's lengthy and tall
and then it has high THC.
Those traits are completely different. It's like me
saying like oh you are
tall because you have brown eyes
like that is not related
whatsoever. Or a
dog is tall because it's
white like that doesn't
have any sort of relationship.
And also we know
for example that there are strains
that have nothing to do with
each other like Girl Scout Cookies for example.
Girl Scout Cookies
you can have
two strange Girl Scout Cookies that are
more closely related to something
completely different except to each
other.
When people ask me
my recommendation
what I tell them is
well you name this
Blue Dream
and they got
a
Cannabis High Times
Cup
then rename it
next time and just call it
Dream Blue.
Yeah that's typically
how it goes. Yeah rename it
or then
just
this Blue Dream
got whatever.
Then name another strange Blue Dream as well
like no one.
And then when people tell me like well but mine
is the real Blue Dream. I don't
know. I can tell you whether
your Blue Dream is related to other
Blue Dreams but I cannot say
who's the real one.
Which one is the real OG?
Yeah. I don't know.
See and that's what's
the most fascinating part of the
topic to me is what we're
talking about and my friend Matt
pointed out to me he's like it's anthropology
Matt like because I was trying to explain to him
like how do I explain to a scientist
what we do and why
what we do
is reliable most importantly
because like anybody can say like
yeah I got this cut and yeah it's real because
I said it's real or it's real because
this guy told me and he's old.
Like these are not good. This is not science.
Right. But there is anthropology to
it in the sense that you know there are people
that have been alive
and in this in the scene
for X amount of years and
were there when this strain first popped up
watched where it came from already
were that kind of person that would record that kind
of data you know and there are these guys
in the cannabis world that exist and have
existed like total nerds.
So there are these people that exist in the
cannabis world that are kind of reclusive
but it's very it's
been a task like that's what I've devoted
my life to is figuring out
who these people are where they're at
and if I can shake down their story
and really figure out is
this one is this provable
is it plausible
probable or total
BS because there's four answers you can get
there and most of them are
right in between two and three
you know there's very little stuff that we can be
like okay we know this came from for example
Dave Watson
we know skunk one came from
Dave Watson 1975
roughly you know
we know that for a fact because it's well documented
at the time it was in books at the time
multiple different sources
he's still around can still give
you know statements that are all contemporaneous
with what was going on at the time this story hasn't
changed however
then we have stories like purple
oracle where we have
nine to ten different claimants
none of them can show that they had any
kind of parental progeny or documentation
on it so it's one of those stories that sits
but oddly enough with things
like goji kush we can we have pretty
good documentation of certain strains like
that because enough people were
around it wasn't so long ago that
a lot of people that were around then are
still around you know
but it's debatable regardless
yeah and I think that it would be
super cool to be able to do
some genetic
study that may
corroborate all of these stories
yes that's the most important
yeah I
think that that could be super
cool I would
be a little hesitant because I have
gotten a lot of
sometimes not a lot of no
some negative
vibes from certain people about
genomics work and about
right and these
tools that are super powerful
and that are going to change
the industry really
so
that part I feel
you know like saying kind of like hey
this is really not blue dream there
may be someone that's not going to like it
right I've heard a lot of feelings in this
industry that way exactly that
you heard a lot of feelings
so I think that it would be a
really cool
genetic study that
corroborates this anthropological
study right exactly
and we've done that with
dogs we've done that with
humans
we know for example that dogs
were domesticated multiple times
by multiple cultures
yes it is pretty crazy
but we also had anthropological
evidence that the Chinese for example
had dogs and that
there were also dogs
in Europe and
in the Americas so
we know that dogs were domesticated
multiple times and we know for
example in humans
one really cool study
that I remember coming
out you know we know that
when Christopher Columbus came
to America
they basically
the Spanish
were different from the British
the British kind of sent
colonies in
North America the Spanish just
took all of the gold and left
like they were not planning on really staying
in South America
but they did you know rape women
killed men
and then took the gold and
left and now we have some
evidence genetic evidence
that many of the
genes that are coming from
men are from
Spain and many of the genes that
are from women are from native
women in South America
and there was this beautiful study that
was published in PNAS I'm gonna
say that it was probably around
2011 or 2012
that
took what we knew anthropologically
and had this genetic
study about the human mitochondria
that is inherited
through the mother and the Y chromosome
that is inherited through the father and it was
so beautiful to see
you know the parallels between
genetics you know
genomics and anthropology
and I think that in cannabis could be
similar. Yeah I mean I guess
that's how you make anthropology scientific
right is you back up the data
or you back it up with data
and I know there was we had talked
about this about 10 years ago we were gonna
start doing it just specifically with the OG
Kush project
and the problem was
one of course you have to source
all of these cuts specifically from
the most reliable sources and
the most reliable
sources in quotes because that's it's only
gonna be what people tell you but if
you get enough of them you can kind of get an idea
a very good idea especially when you
know multiple people confirm certain sources
and we're gonna do that but at the same time
we didn't know of any
reliable place except there was one
company at the time called Phylos
to even do the testing
to tell us the
the matrilineal patrilineal
relations any of that stuff and
they any OG
that was submitted to them they all said was the same clone
they were not able to tell when
it was obvious like when someone was like giving
a known self line
like saying I pop the seed from a known self line
from this clone I'll send you a clone of this and one of
this send it to him and it was showing up
as the exact same clone so we already knew
it wasn't gonna be reliable from the jump
you know so
Phylos they do have that
galaxy which is
trustworthy I think that they have done a good job
at the galaxy and they have all of the
the pushes right so
their galaxy I
know the tests behind
the algorithms behind
that galaxy and the cool thing is
that you can shift it right and you can
kind of zoom in to a particular
part so I think that that is pretty cool
and
I disagree or
I don't know what
are they doing right now regarding their
sequencing but I disagree
with particular ways of sequencing
the genome I think
that there's other ways of sequencing where you
can get a lot of information and
you can also explore other things
but if
you have multiple individuals
multiple pushes that are
that may not be related to each other
and they are all appearing as the same clone
I would be
hesitant about
those results and I think that it may
be the way that they're sequencing right so
so there are for example for
paternity tests so to
figure out whether that is your child or
not yeah there are
particular genomic regions that you sequence
on the other genomic regions right you
sequence genomic regions
that are very varied between
individuals yeah because there are
genes that are extremely conserved
between you and I that
you know you're Mexican I'm
Colombian they may not differ
yeah yeah so but
there are reliable paternity
tests so you need to figure out
which region of the genome
you're sequencing and I think
that there could have been a
problem with phylos
doing that sure yeah I mean
in a hypothetical situation I
will say it that way like
we were taking a
a clone mom like
let's for the for example call this
sendo stirps
and a
love a cush right
and we were taking
that mother clone and the
other mother clone submitting those to phylos
we cross them together
ran the progeny we know that
one I mean the progeny is all either
or a variance of
it's very reliable and breeding
sent them a clone of that and none
of them showed related at all
between all three and that's when we were like okay so
we have the OG cush data we have
some pretty known data when it comes to cookies on
cookies parentage and it's not showing up
in phylos data and then we did that to
test and see how
hypothetically we did that allegedly
that was done to see
how if
it would really show up like that and
in one case there was like chem 91
and chem 91
s1 self line sent
and they were able to tell this is a self
version of that or really close relation
to that but in many
cases they couldn't tell direct relations from
each other so there was there was no consistency
like sometimes it was right and sometimes
it was just so off it was really confusing
to me and I never knew why it never
made any sense to me and I don't understand
the science behind how they collect the data
where the error
would have been but it's always fascinated me to no
end so okay so I'm gonna
explain something
to you which I think could
be I don't know if it's
for sure but it could be one of the reasons
so when you are
sequencing a genome right you have all
of the letters of the DNA
there's multiple ways
of sequencing the genome right
there's one way
that is called whole genome shotgun
okay where you take
the entire genome
and you sequence it all
when you're sequencing whole genome shotgun
there's something that it's called the coverage
so the coverage
is the amount
of times that on average
each letter of the DNA is being
sequenced so on average
if you have 1x on average
each letter is sequenced one time
if you have 10x on average
each letter is sequenced 10 times
if you have 100x on average
each letter is sequenced 100 times
right okay so
I really like whole genome shotgun even
if it's 1x because you
have the entire genome and you can
look at different regions of the genome
and at the end of the day it is
cheaper per letter
to sequence the entire genome at a
whole genome shotgun okay
there is another way of sequencing the
genome which is called genotyping
by sequencing GBS
in GBS
what you do
is that you take the genome
and then you break it down into
pieces with these enzymes
these proteins that are kind of like these
little scissors that you break
the genome into pieces
and then you end up sequencing
only 1% of the genome
approximately
1-2% of the genome
GBS helps you
to figure out whether
you're more closely related to me or whether
you're more closely related to your mom
okay so that is
GBS however
GBS has
a lot of problems
one of the problems is repetition
okay so even if you do
it with the same
restriction enzymes the same pair of scissors
and even if you follow
the same protocol repetition
is not consistent
and there is
a paper showing that, that repetition in
GBS is not consistent
and in addition to that you know even though
it's cheaper because you're only sequencing 1%
it's cheaper in general
per letter it is
not cheaper than whole genome shotgun
okay and
there are different pairs of scissors
there's different restriction enzymes
so I have
this study in 2016
that we compared
the
GBS data from one group
to another and because they had used different
restriction enzymes
we could not compare
the data between them we could just
compare it to the whole genome shotgun
so this one against the whole genome shotgun
this one against the whole genome shotgun but we couldn't
compare these two
there were no overlaps
so it is my understanding
that phyto-sequencing
sequences GBS I don't know if they
still do but at least at some point
in their lives they did
and I'm always questioning
that reasoning whether it's
for you know
profits you know because you don't want to
spend more money or because the questions
that you have
you just need to know whether you're more closely
related to your mom than to me and
that's it but you cannot look at
the repetitive content of the genome
you know the junk DNA you cannot look at that
you cannot look at whole
genes right
you cannot look whether these
entire genes
have different copies so
I question GBS
and I think that that may
be one of the reasons why
they got those
results with you I would not be
surprised with GBS
and especially
I am really sloppy
you know I bump things
you know in the lab
there's a hair somewhere
I'm the type of person that is
trying to look neat and then you have you know toothpaste
yeah yeah that is me
I have never been
good at doing something
more than DNA extractions
my DNA extractions are fine
but if you have to do something like
GBS where you have to
sonicate and then you have to do
the restriction enzyme and then you
have to do this other that wouldn't
work yeah yeah
so if you need to have
a really good technician and even then
your results are not
reputable and if they're
not repeatable isn't that what like
science is like
to be able to show something is repeatable
to have
repeatable results to make
a valid I mean I'm a layman
so like I'm good at like English
and history and stuff like that so if
I'm wrong correct me but like that
also makes me think like okay so
if that data is incorrect with just those very few
examples that we noticed and we're
one out of tens
of thousands of people who use this
when they go to sell said data
if it doesn't merge well with
other people's data sets
said data might end up worthless
so all that investment
savings that they went to be cheaper
to save whatever if that was
the theory in it would end up
not working out so well
I would think I mean it just
yeah from my point of
view as someone who's like a history
and not a math person or science person it
doesn't make much sense
I 100%
agree with you and unfortunately
people in the world
I'm going to say something that
look we know that there's a
lot of science that it's not
repeatable for example
Excel spreadsheets
right we know that Excel spreadsheets
when you type one whatever
it translates it to January
12 yeah yeah
what
so that we know
that Excel you know
screws things up yeah
but we also know that there's
other science
old science that
may not be repeatable
right now that
at that time so
similar to GBS I think that
GBS it's going to be a few
years until people stop using it for
these reasons and for other reasons
yeah but there's
other techniques
enzymatic techniques that
people do not use anymore I
used all those times during my PhD
that no one uses that anymore
and
just to give you another example
studies with mice
we found out
we in the world I mean we found out
that
mice respond differently
to humans whether
it's a female that is
treating the mice or whether it's a
male that's treating the mice
so results with
experimental mice may differ
whether the
person conducting this
experiment was a woman or a man
is it like scent hormone or
I don't know
but we know that there is
we know
that there is this gap in science we know
that there's a lot of data sets that
are not publicly available
including some from my papers
one paper because of some
reasons but I
try to make my data available
because I think it's fair with
the world and particularly
because I don't know what's
going to happen I don't know whether my
analysis was entirely correct
I don't know whether you analyze it
differently and are going to get a
different result or right
so I think that I should make all of my
data public for anyone
here or in Patagonia Argentina
or in Shanghai China to be
able to analyze my data and tell
me hey I did get what
you or I disagree with
you yeah right
yeah and I think that
in many cases that's not the way with
science that's not the way with Excel
spreadsheets that's not the way with
and I think that with GBS
data whenever I see GBS data
I'm like I'm not like I'm not
analyzing that yeah
and you know what's funny is because
Phylos was embedded in our
our subculture
for so long I mean it was like a good
I don't know eight years that
people were taking their data and being like
making conclusions from it and
making other conclusions from it based
on those conclusions that Phylos had made
and it's it when we
kind of realized how bad or
inconsistent some of the data was
it was like slowly unraveling
stuff in our head like we always used to make
these conclusions based on that data but that's now
invalid data and you actually
have to go through and like
remove it from your brain
scrub your brain from all this thing
so now when I see people with Phylos data I'm like
I don't want to see it because it doesn't matter
because it might be right but it might
not and that's an unreliable narrator
I can't do it. Yeah
I think that there's some things that are right
you know I think that they're gonna see that the
relationship between strains may be right
um
but now that they're doing breeding
I don't know I honestly
don't know. I don't
even I remember
when all that blew up and
a lot of people's anger at it but for me like
I was just more interested in like are
you putting out good data or bad data
people are purchasing data this is my
I don't care what you do with any
of your breeding or any of that because they you know
I mean until they started asking
for whole seeds and stuff like that
that that's when it became different
but when it came
to the data is this data consistent with
what we're seeing no okay then why not
and then when we start finding out it's not well
then what are you doing luckily
I think they don't no longer do data sequencing
and they're just doing their breeding program now
which is cool props to them I hope they have good
luck with it you know
one of the other things in cannabis
that we ran into over
the years that we've been trying to figure out
is in cannabis sex reversal
uh ethylene plays a major
role right
a lot of times we're seeing a
clone like take a clone
take 60 cuts off a single mom
they'll be in a tray 10 inch
by 20 inch tray 50 of them
next to each other you'll get
30 percent distribution that
actually reverse really well
30 percent that kind of do
and 30 percent that won't at all or
it'll reverse and won't drop viable pollen
and none of us know why
and this has been going on for decades
and none of us can figure it out
so I'm interested to hear your take on it
I don't know
okay I'm gonna okay I'm gonna
so okay
we know that cannabis has
X and Y chromosomes
yes so if you are
an XX you're a female
if you're an XY you're a male
kind of like us right
and then we have the monoecious
which people in the industry
call the hermes so let's call it
hermes although they're actually
monoecious yes so
the hermes we know that
there are particular regions of
the chromosomes that are very similar
to the female chromosomes
however we don't know
exactly how
different the monoecious
chromosomes are from those of the female chromosomes
oh interesting
we don't know that entirely
we know that the Y chromosome
in the males it's very big
it's the biggest of all of the chromosomes
and
so when you're sequencing a genome
there's something
that is called the genome assembly
so an assembly is when you
you know you're sequencing the genome and you have to
partition those regions into
pieces and then you have to
put them together
that's when coverage comes really handy
because if you have something that is
more than one X
so if you have something that is let's say
100 X then it's easier
for you to put the puzzles together
because then you have this piece, this piece
then you have this other one and then you know
you're starting to put your puzzle together
and ideally you would
have in cannabis you would
have 11 pieces
right because it has 9
autosomes so 9 chromosomes that
are not related to sex
9 then you have an X
and then you have a Y
so you have 11 different pieces
that is your complete
puzzle. There is a really
good assembly that was produced by
Chris Grasa
and Chris Grasa et al 2021
which is a female
however we
do not have
the puzzle for the Y chromosome
or the puzzle for the monoecious
chromosome. We do not have
we do know
that if you have
a Y chromosome you're
very likely to produce pollen
and if you have 2 X chromosomes
you're very likely to produce
female flowers
there are some varieties
as you said that if you put
ethylene or you know silver nitrate
whatever they start producing
flowers from the opposite sex in males
if you put ethylphen
it starts producing flowers
female flowers. There are some strains
that are more prone than others
yes
we don't know why
we don't know which are the genes
that are turning on
we think
that those genes
may not be related to the
X and the Y chromosomes we think that those
genes may be somewhere
else in the genome
we think. Interesting, yeah
because if you have the X
and the Y chromosome
you still express you know whatever
sex it is if you have
XY you're male if you have XX you're
female but then if you
like if you force them to
produce the other sex
there's some that produce them and some not
so maybe these genes are
found somewhere else but we
have some idea of some genes
that are turned on and turned off
and I think
that that is a really
interesting question
why, when
how do you turn these genes on
is it just that
some individuals do not have them
and like I said even if
they're clones of each other in the same tray
one inch apart meaning the angles of light are very
similar like how they're being fed
is identical you'll see
30% in a random distribution not like
in one set next to each other they'll be
totally random and it blows my mind
every time that we just can't figure
it out we just cannot
I would love to explore
that, that was what really caught my attention
in cannabis was that sex
part, right, the X
yeah yeah and I've never so far
worked you know I worked in the cannabinoid genes
I worked in and at the beginning when
I started working in the cannabinoid genes it was
like oh why, now I love
them, I absolutely love them
but that
part of the sex is
super interesting to me
because the Y chromosome, you know the Y
chromosome in humans is very very small
it's tiny, okay
and it basically has
you know very few genes and there's one gene
that says hey everyone
wake up
you know express and that's why
I have many
of the genes that you have to produce
to produce beard, to produce all of the
hormones that men produce
but I don't have that gene
that wakes everyone up
and the Y chromosome is
tiny, basically has that one gene and that's
it, in cannabis on the other hand
the Y chromosome is humongous
and one of the reasons why I think that
we do not have a proper assembly is
because it's so big and it's
full with repetitive elements, junk
DNA, and the repetitive
elements are repetitive
so you have repetition
repetition, repetition, how many
do you have? It's so hard to tell
it's so difficult to put together
because it's repetitive and repetitive
and repetitive so it's very hard
to know when it ends and when it starts
right?
and so it's yeah
so we don't know what's going on in that
chromosome.
That's like the one thing that's driven me
for a long time, like we developed
a spray that is a ready to mix
spray for people
that's silver nitrate, sodium thiosulfate
based, you know, and
the one thing that
me and a few other people that are making FeminiSeeds
longer than anyone else in the US, we've just
never been able to figure out that one factor
and when you sell the spray, people are
always like, well how do we know for sure?
and to tell them
I don't know, just numbers
bet on numbers, always use
high amounts of numbers because odds are in
your favor eventually if you use enough numbers
that you'll have successful
I mean, the one thing I've learned too
when I did a population of
there was 16,000 plants
3,000 of which I reversed
and it was hemp
and one thing I noticed with hemp is
unlike high THC cannabis
it reversed immediately
usually there's like the stagger period
in cannabis, high THC
cannabis where it takes 2 and a half weeks
to then show their sex as being
a male, completely reversed
in hemp it was like that
and they were ready to drop pollen
for fiber or grain?
this was hemp, it was Remedy
hemp kush cross, so it was more for
CBD production
ok, so it was high
and it triggered immediately
but in that population of
3,000 that were reversed
there was probably 3 that didn't
reverse at all, stayed totally female
no matter how much they were sprayed with
and I'd never seen that in
high THC cannabis, but I'd never ran
that many plants in high THC cannabis
so it was really interesting to see stuff like that
in sexual reversals
that there were even plants that were totally resistant
to that kind of spray
in sex reversals
interesting, yeah but it took seeing a large
population to even be able to see 3
you know, like
I would love to do
experiments with that and see what's going on
in the genome, like what genes are you
turning on, what genes are you turning off
right, I think that that's super
interesting, yeah
if you ever want to work on anything, I am more than
happy to send you whatever you need
we're always doing all kinds of experiments using all
kinds of different ethylene blockers
and all kinds of
different stuff, but yeah
I think that you should
quantify those things
right, of these however many, because
I think that numbers are so powerful
so of these 16,000
there were, I don't know
7,000 and then you quantify and then
when you do it again in
I don't know, 20, 25
then you do it again and you quantify
and then you have numbers
like what is the ratio, what are the
odds, and then when you sell your
product you can say like, hey you know
it works for 30%
of the individuals when you have 1,600
you should do it when you
have more than 5
right, you'll find that a lot
of like cannabis breeders
that have been doing it a long time
they all fall on the autism spectrum
hardcore, and most of them keep
refuse to keep data written down and it's all
up here, because they've lived with that idea
that like if I get caught with any
kind of numbers or data I'm going to get busted
and they're going to use it against me in a court of law
so almost everyone keeps every bit of data
up, it's crazy, some of the
I'm not that great at keeping data stored
like my memory's not that great, but some of my friends
I'm like, how do you remember
like 25 years of data
and they just magically
do, but yeah nothing's better than hard written
data with a, you know, that you can
compare and refer back
to, yeah
so I want to talk
and of course this is what you referred to
as you know, something that probably people
think is the most controversial topic that
you like talking about is
GMO science and cannabis, and I want
to talk about the future of cannabis, where you think it's
going to go from here and where we can go
what are some of the beautiful things
that GMO science can bring
to cannabis?
Well, I mean
GMO, so I
have a non-for-profit organization
the Agricultural Genomics Foundation
and the aim of that non-for-profit
and I hope that I someday
can fulfill that
goal is to
develop
genetic tools for the use
of the public. These genetic
tools include GMO, so GMO
is genetically
modified organism.
What classify as a GMO
or not, that's
very debatable
but in general, you know, if you
can, if you
need to be in a
lab space
for you to
put the gene or
take it out or express whatever
then it's probably
a GMO, right?
I
think that GMOs
are a very important
tool.
They
we have
GMOs everywhere, this big
strawberries in the supermarket
they're polyploid and they were
you know
many, they are not
existing naturally, it was
humans that somehow
made that, I mean, yeah, artificial selection
is being done
by humans but there are
a lot of GMOs in many things
that we eat, in rice, in a
bunch of things. I think GMOs
could be super useful for cannabis
or marijuana
for example, to
enhance maybe the production of
cannabinoids in hemp
to silence
certain genes if you don't
want THC then
it could help. That's been a big problem
for a lot of hemp producers
is testing hot, sure.
Testing hot and especially if
you're growing for fiber or for
grain, why do you care about THC?
Yeah, why have to put energy into it?
Into it, yeah, and sometimes
some of these varieties for grain or for
fiber go over 0.3, they
have, I don't know, 0.5.
Who cares if a grain variety
has 0.8? The farmer
because now he or she are
in trouble, right? Exactly.
It's serious at that point.
Exactly. So I think
that that, for example, in the sex
determination stuff, I think
that that would be important to know exactly
whether or not your plant
is going to produce
flowers of the opposite sex
because sometimes your plants just
herm out and
you then have seeds and it's like, who
was the hermie here, right?
So I think
that GMOs could be useful for that
and for hemp, for fiber
and for grain as well to produce
bigger grain or to produce
plants that maybe
this is resistant to particular
diseases. Right now
with a changing environment
due to the climate crisis,
I think that those techniques are going to
come very handy. So
in general, I see a very bright
future in that sense. The issue
for me, these tools
are happening in every
single crop. It's not just
cannabis. They are happening.
The issue for me is who
owns those
tools? Absolutely. Who is able
to access those tools and
whether the access of
those tools is going to benefit
the public, the grower,
the consumer, or if
it's going to benefit a
corporation. Sure. I think
that's super important, the politics of it.
Yeah. That is
my issue with those tools.
Hence why I
have the non-profit organization, which at
some point I hope that I can grow
enough for...
I mean, I don't know if it's going
to be a big enough
non-for-profit to
combat big corporations
in
big ag or big tobacco
or big pharma, but
maybe we
can help the public somehow.
What kind
of funding would we need in
order to be able to make
any kind of difference in
being able to use this technology
for people that
it could benefit that
maybe aren't rich? I mean, because I know this technology
is expensive. That's
one of the prohibitive factors
in why you would have to establish a non-profit
in order to do this.
What kind of funding would we need?
Elon Musk-type funding?
Is it a few million?
Yeah.
Many of these companies
in the cannabis space,
like the phyto-type companies, medicinal
genomics-type companies, they
have raised in the millions
four, five, six,
max,
less than $10, seven, eight million.
I think that
for us at AGF,
Agricultural Genomics Foundation is
a non-for-profit that I run.
I am looking for a few
thousand dollars to start
public awareness and
public education
and to teach people
really what is a genome?
How do you
do these tools?
For that, a few
hundred thousand dollars
could go
a long way.
A few thousand dollars,
less than $100,000,
a few thousand dollars could go a long way
on teaching people how to use
this. Not that everyone is
going to become a genomicist or a bioinformatician,
but
how to be educated
about it. That's
what we're trying to do now,
is figuring out how to raise
that funding to be able to
start growing this and
start educating the public
and making
some of these tools
and then being able to
get this
running, basically.
How far out do you think we are from
say
turning on or off the gene
that is responsible for
let's say HPLV,
something like that, a viroid that's
ravaging cannabis right now.
How far out would we be from being able
to combat something like that, GMO
speaking? So that's the hoplite
and viroid? Yes. Is it
really bad in California? It's
bad everywhere. Because of the nurseries
and how
hype strains were pushed
in and there were demands for specific
strains, it spread like wildfire.
And in Spain
now too. Here we don't
have that as much in New York State.
Oh yeah. New York State's not one
of the big hubs of growing
with nurseries and stuff like that. California,
Oregon, Colorado,
Washington, Spain. I know
Amsterdam's been ravaged recently.
Belgium.
Yeah, it's all over now.
Oh wow. So it's a matter of time.
It's a matter of time.
How long are we going to
take? I don't know. And disease
is just...
Because disease evolves
too, right? We can see it in COVID
and then we have the Delta and then we have the Omicron
and then we have... So it's also
changing.
It's also...
You're changing and the virus is changing
as well. So that one is hard.
What I would recommend in that case
is have a good tissue
culture facility where you can
do tissue culture and you can assure
that your stock
is clean, which is
hard. Yeah, sure.
And expensive. I think
that breeding is another
good thing when you have
actual males and females that you're
breeding and then, yes, again,
you have to do the phenohunting and then
it takes several generations and then you have
two siblings that are nothing alike and
then you have to grow however many hundreds
of thousands of seeds to look for that one
that is the one that you like.
But as you go
and as you're doing
inbreeding, parents and offspring
or full sibs, then
you get better traits.
But in terms of
disease, I think that the best thing that you
can have is diversity, is as much
variation as possible because then
if you have full sibs,
maybe these two are affected
by the virus, but maybe these two are not.
Exactly. It's super important.
So that regarding
disease, but there's other traits that I think
cannabinoids, maybe terpenes,
there's other traits that I know that people
are looking at flowering time
genes. Sure.
That we may have genetic
tools available sooner.
Oh, interesting. See, that would
be so cool because they're, you know, I mean, flowering
time is a serious determiner of
probably, as best
we can tell, a high. I mean, there's certain
highs that you can get from
an 18-week flowering
plant from Colombia that you can't get
from an 8-week flowering plant
from Afghanistan.
That's really interesting. Yeah.
I'd like to see that played
with a bunch. Is there anything else in
breeding in cannabis that
has totally blown your mind that you found
like that was quite unexpected
once you started looking at the genes?
That was quite unexpected
once we started looking at the genes.
Well, the cannabinoid
genes, it was,
you know, it's so cool
because at the beginning,
we thought that it
was one gene
with two different alleles,
like with two different forms of a gene,
right? Yeah. So that
if you were dominant
for one, then you produce CBD.
If you were dominant for the other one, then you
produce THC. And then if you were
heterozygous, right, so if you were
homozygous, you produced THC.
Homozygous for the other allele, you produced CBD.
And then if you were heterozygous,
then you produced both. Yeah.
But then we found out that there
are multiple genes related
to cannabinoid production.
Multiple. And
that individuals differ in the number
of genes. So
when we found that out,
I remember the day
that we found this out and I was doing
the genome alignments and I was looking
at them and then
my lab mate at the time,
who's now a good friend and collaborator,
Kyle, he was
the one that was like, this doesn't look right.
Look at this alignment.
And then we found out that there were actually
different genes and there were multiple
genes that were very similar to each
other. And then we found out
that, yes, indeed, there are different copies.
Individuals differ in these different
copies, but these genes are in close
proximity. And now
I'm working on this paper
that I hope to have published by
2023
that we now
see that
there are multiple genes,
for example, for CBC production.
Right? So there's a bunch of
genes related to CBC production.
Why is CBC produced
in such little quantities?
Why? If there's so many
genes related to CBC production, like that
is a question that I'm like, why?
And my hypothesis
is that, you know, like these enzymes,
we know that they're very similar.
They act on the same precursor molecule, which is
CBGA.
And they're sloppy
because they produce each other's compounds.
And they
are promiscuous because
they act on CBGA, the same
precursor molecule. So
they are promiscuous, they are sloppy, they're
nothing, they're not
very accurate at all.
My hypothesis
is that CBCA synthase, so this
enzyme that is producing CBCA
is producing everything
else except for CBC, right?
It's producing everything else
because the genes are so
abundant. Everyone,
independent if you're a hemp for fiber and
grain or independent if you're a marijuana type
or if you're a CBDA
type of plant, independent
of that, everyone has
a CBCA gene. What are
those guys doing? They're
partying. What are they doing?
Yeah, that's so fascinating.
And are there other cannabinoids
that exist in cannabis that like we may not
even know about that may be
more important in the high factor than we
even know? Or anything that
exists like that? I don't
know, but you know the
terpenes are produced in very
low quantities. So you have, for example,
for THC you have
28% by dry weight or
even 30, even 35% by dry
weight. While you see, for example, for
Mersin, it's like
5% or 3%.
But it still smells.
Yeah, yeah. And there's some
things that are not even, so
that are even the part per million.
So they're really tiny amounts.
Whether or not that affects
your high, I don't know.
Right? But
I think that's something that we
do desperately need to
do in the cannabis industry is to
do
controlled studies without
you knowing what you're consuming.
So we have
this joint, we know the exact
chemotype of this joint or whatever
chemotype we know because
we're discovering
this THC.
Like Delta A became a thing.
So maybe there's another cannabinoid
that we had not calibrated.
The BLC, whatever.
Chemists do not hate me.
Or maybe what
I just said was completely stupid.
But
okay, we measure the chemotype
and then we give it to you and then we
Matthew smoke this and tell me what
you feel, questionnaire.
Maybe we can, we can
take blood before and afterwards.
Right? Yeah. And then
blinded study that you
don't know what you're getting.
And then we can do it with
however many hundreds of people.
Different
joints with different
chemotypes. Yeah.
And that people do not know what they're getting.
And then we can tell us, okay, this is what I felt
on Friday. I exercise, I ate,
I slept, I am depressed.
Right? We know that for
alcohol, if you're depressed or
if you're, um, if
you ate, we know that there's
a difference in how drunk
you get. Oh, sure. Women
and men, we know that there's a difference in alcohol
in cannabis. We, we do
have some suggestions that there
are differences between women and
men, but we don't know if you
if you slept, if you exercise,
am I going to feel the same with this
joint today than on Friday?
I don't know. Yeah. There's no way to quantify it
yet. Yeah. So we need those studies,
I think. And, and with
with the laws in place currently,
we cannot do those studies federally?
No.
Federally, we cannot, but we could do
them in, in, in states, in, in
regulated states. Um,
and in Colorado, one of my,
um, I have some papers with
her cinnamon Bidwell collaborator of mine.
She has the can of van
and in the can of van,
she goes to places because she
cannot bring people on campus and have them
go get high. So
she goes in the van and
then she takes up blood before you
consume it. And after you consume it, and what
she tells you is just consume it
as you were normally going to consume cannabis.
Sure. And, and then
she takes blood and she does some sort of
cognitive tests. Can you re, so
we know that there's short term memory.
So she does, you know, remember
like try to memorize this, um,
grocery store list.
Um, and things like that before
and after. So, so she has done
something like that, but we don't know
with particular chemotypes, right.
Yeah. And then again, for
you to measure those chemotypes, you have to go to
a reputable lab.
There are some labs that are
not that reputable. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
But there are some that are.
Yeah. So, so
those particular labs.
Yeah. That's,
that's, that's fascinating. I think, I think
you wouldn't find a shortage of people wanting to
do that, like willing to give their blood
to just go get baked and
give results. I'd be down. I mean, that sounds
like fun.
That's fun science. It would be super
fun, but from the researchers
perspective, you do
need a lot of paperwork
in order to be able to do that, even to give
you a questionnaire, even if I'm
not touching you, just to give
you the questionnaire, there's a
huge amount of paperwork and stuff that
you have to do. Yeah, I can't imagine taking
blood, like all that stuff would be
so much paperwork to even be able to
do that on people. Yeah,
and then it's like, why are you doing that? No, I'm getting people
high. It's like, yeah, yeah.
Oh, man.
Well, is there anything else you want to talk about
before we finish up?
I want to talk about your non-profit again.
Can you mention what it's called?
The Agricultural Genomics Foundation,
AGF, and
the website.
Can I put it here in the chat?
What is it? I'll type it out right here.
Yeah, you can put it in the chat and I can cut and paste it over.
Agricultural
Genomics dot org. There we
go. And I can paste it
over, let's see,
right here.
So that is the name of the
non-profit, and I do
a lot of public outreach
through it. I'm trying to
educate the public through it.
I also do consulting
as a side gig,
and
you can find me
on social media.
And what's your Twitter
name? It's
at Kana
Bacana.
Let me go over here just so we can get it on there
because I know everybody's going to be asking.
And Instagram as well.
And then on LinkedIn, I
also use LinkedIn. Let me see my
LinkedIn profile
because we don't know if Twitter
is going to live.
Yeah, through Elon? Yeah, nobody
knows yet. Yeah, nobody knows whether
Twitter is going to be a thing
anymore.
So I don't know. I mean, is that
LinkedIn? It seems so boring
sometimes. You know, I've never even
signed up for LinkedIn in my life.
I just never
done it. I don't even know anything about it.
So it's
supposed to be a professional
Facebook, in my opinion.
Yeah.
And I have been,
I accept everyone on LinkedIn.
It's like, do you want to be my friend? It's like, sure!
But LinkedIn
lately has
been good. I do consulting
and I have found several gigs
through LinkedIn lately. So it's
accomplished its job.
Yeah. You know, you never know.
But if you want to hear me
rant politically, like I did to Matthew
today, then... I love it.
I just cannot,
I do not understand how can you not
be political
in this climate right now.
Yeah, my family was
United Farm Workers, so I'm hardcore
like, you know, union,
you know, social programs.
I'm all about it. Is that
what it is called? The syndicate?
Yeah, it is. The overall
goal with the syndicate when I originally
came up with it, and it's like
a pie in the sky idea
where I want to take it. But a lot of
these people that came before me,
even me, we don't have
retirement programs for any of them. And I've seen
a lot of people that laid the foundation
for this industry just be run over.
And they're having the hardest time. They're having to find
new jobs. And these are people
who deserve recognition
for the work that they have earned their place in our society.
And I'd love to make it some kind of union
kind of deal where
there's retirement plans, medical plans,
you know, things like that for people in the future.
But it's just a pie in the sky
idea because I don't know a lot of people
that would be into
putting their hard time work and money into it.
But I'll keep putting my work in.
You know?
I think...
So did you see that
there was a video
that came out
recently regarding
the cannabis industry
in California?
I don't know whether...
I don't think I saw it.
whether you watched it. Let me see
if I find it.
But
they
have Steve
D'Angelo.
And
I think it's
super interesting because I think
that California
kind of
did it wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah. Steve D'Angelo
is nobody's... At least from our
point of view,
the hardcore people,
Steve D'Angelo has never been someone that any of us
are like, yeah, I want to see that dude do well
because he was the first to bring in
corporate, push it. And when he found out he
wasn't rich enough to play ball with the big boys
recently, he's like, yeah, I shouldn't have done Prop 64.
And it's like, well, then why'd you push it, bro?
You ruined a lot of people's lives.
In my opinion, my friends are now out of
work and hurting.
But I think
you should watch that
YouTube video
because he does talk
about that. You know, like he does
talk about Prop
64 and
how California
kind of did it wrong in that
way, right?
Let me see if
I find it.
It's such
a good... Is that my
kid watches videos also
in my thing?
So then I get, you know, like...
I know what you mean. Yeah. Your history
gets all twisted up. Yeah. My history,
it's all like my kid
watching a stupid toy
video. I think the
hardest part for me with Steve D'Angelo is
that we were the
group, like our friends were the group that
was pushing back against him when
we were saying, hey, guy, this isn't going to
work. It's going to screw a lot of people. And he
put so much money and hate behind
it to push back against us.
And at the end, he realized,
oh, I don't get
to play ball. I'm not
a multi-trillionaire like these people
that are going to own cannabis. This isn't
fair, and I don't like what I see.
But we all saw that long before he
did, and he fought against us. So it's
like, yeah, we get you don't see it now, but if they
would let you play ball, you probably would have.
That's the way I look at it with him. Very
disingenuous fellow. I just, you know,
I've never understood really California
in general, because California
is as big as Columbia
almost in population, right? California has,
I don't know, 45 million people.
Columbia has 50 million
people. So it's an entire country.
It's
huge.
It has an ocean. It has mountains.
It has a desert. I don't really
understand why California doesn't secede
from the US.
All about it. Right?
It's the fourth largest economy
in the world, I think. Fourth
or sixth?
But around there, right?
So just
the state of California.
So
I don't...
It's huge, right? What is going on
in California when you talk about...
It's so different from the information
that we get around here.
But it is... Okay, so I found
it. It is called... It's
a Forbes documentary.
So I'm going to put it here in the chat.
Forbes. And it's called
How America
Botched
Cannabis Legalization.
Gotcha. Let's see.
And it was
released five days ago.
So I watched it this week. Oh, interesting.
Okay. Yeah.
And I think that it's an interesting
take. I don't think...
I think that the documentary should be
how California...
Right? Because
what's going on in the other states is
completely different. Yes. California
is the biggest market in the entire US.
Yes. But what's going on
here in New York, it's very different
from what happened in Colorado.
It's very different from what's going on in California.
Yeah. So I think
that we have to keep that in mind.
But I totally recommend this documentary.
When I was looking at
early on in California when it was
first going legal with 215,
what I saw was stuff in
Amsterdam where they had bedrock on.
It started out as there were shops.
All of a sudden, you couldn't grow. Now you can't
sell seeds. You can't make seeds.
But one corporation was able to take it over
and get the main thing. Then I saw
the same kind of stuff happen.
I saw in Canada started going that way
too. And then in California,
with the Prop 64, everybody was kind of
like, well, it's looking like
it's going to be too expensive for any of the
legacy farmers to own any licenses.
And we couldn't even afford to
buy the equipment to surveil ourselves
with the cameras, let alone
afford to run a business and make money off
that when the guy down the street
is quadrupling the
production on us and able to charge
and able to run at a loss
for 10 years, whereas we're
small farmers. We can't run at a loss for a year, let
alone 10. And they know that they can wipe
out the market that way and
drive everyone out.
Yes, I agree. I mean, I
don't know. Honestly, I know.
I don't know. I know that Israel
is very governmentally controlled, isn't it?
Yes, yes, yes. As well as
the Netherlands. Yes.
So I think that here in the
US, it's different because you
can get corporations
that are multi-billion
dollar corporations where you have
a guy just
spend billions of dollars in a social
media. Yeah, yeah.
I think because
there is no...
The capitalism
here is going to an extreme.
Yeah.
But I do think
that you need
some sort of governmental
regulations in some sense.
And I
think that the problem of California
was that there may have been
too much governmental regulations.
Yeah. And that
you're requiring the legal
industry to operate
at a loss compared to
the illicit market,
right? The illicit market must not
test
as thoroughly.
The illicit market
does not have to have the packaging
that the... So I think
that you're operating at a loss
due to those particular laws and
regulations, which is something that
New York State, for example, different from Colorado.
Colorado is not as
regulated as California or New York State.
And now in New York State, it's kind of
like, hey, do not make
people test...
Make them test as you would test for
a tomato, right? Yeah, yeah.
If you're going to consume the tomato and... Yeah.
I went apple picking
three weeks ago, two weeks ago,
and I took an apple from the tree
and I ate it. I am fine.
I am sure that there were
some living organism in that
apple. I am sure.
It didn't kill me, right?
Had I smoked that apple, I think
that I would still not be dead.
Yeah. Same thing with weed, right?
Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, I
totally agree. I just hope
that there's a time where anywhere
that people
just don't settle.
And I feel like that was the attitude
with Prop 64 and 215,
for that matter. They're finally going to
give us a little bit. Why don't we just take
what we can get now and maybe fight for more
later? And what I've learned
just in all laws is
they don't really give you what they
aren't willing to lose. And if
they're not willing to lose more than that, you're never going to get it.
It's what benefits whoever
is in power and can pay the
pay the piper.
But I do think that there are some people
that are in power that
are actually looking for
the best for their people.
Yes, I do understand that some people
are in power and it's like, I have the
power and I'm the king. But I do actually think
that there are some people who are in power that are kind of like,
hey, let's build something.
That's why I think elections are
so important. But I also
think that many of the laws and regulations, for example,
regarding the zero police
3% THC.
I'm always, why didn't
they ask me about that regulation,
which makes no sense.
Who is going to get high
on a 0.8
THC
fiber hemp when
you go to a dispensary and you have a
98%
concentrate? It makes no
sense at all. Who did they consult
for these kind of laws?
Do we know
who they consulted for these kind of laws?
That's horrible.
I mean, there's some regulations here in New York
State that are kind of like, dude, you have never
grown a plant before, right?
You're limiting the
acreage size and how are you
determining? So you have,
do you have a house plant?
Do you have a plant living in your living room?
There's some regulations that are just,
you know, a guy
decided. A lawyer that
knew how to write laws
decided.
Yeah.
We've got a long way to go, but I'm
really excited about the future, especially
as it comes to science with breeding,
because I'm such a nerd when it comes
to breeding. I love the idea,
whether it's through
successive generations and breeding
in a trait, or whether it's being able
to eliminate a trait completely that
has no beneficial
anything to what we're doing,
that helps breeding. That helps
make our projects
with successive generations even easier.
So I'm super stoked to see what you do,
and I'd be really excited to work with you on
any level in that in the future. And I
really appreciate you taking your time tonight
to come and hang out with me in a conversation.
I want to have you back soon.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, I'm excited too, because my
job in extension in Cornell
is very related to
farmers. I hope that I get to do
that with, on site
with cannabis farmers
and hemp as well, you know, for
grain, and hopefully for grain,
I hope that I get to do
that here as
well. And I think that breeding,
that's going to be the key, right?
It's not going to be yet, I think.
Well, I'm excited
that we're also having these conversations. Thank you very much for having me.
