Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0, where we explore the history of a clandestine scene.
Researching everything from cannabis strain history, old smuggling tales from the first
person perspective, to breeding science and news on current subculture.
I'm your host Matthew, and I'll occasionally be joined by my homie NotSoDog, breeder and
grower from Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and sometimes interview other participants.
Our goal is to document this history before it's written by corporations and others who
just weren't there.
Let's start righting some wrongs.
Welcome to the underground.
You'll notice with a lot of our interviews, it kind of just jumps into a conversation
and this will be no different.
And the ending will probably be no different as well.
So apologies in advance.
A lot of our conversations are all over the place.
It's a bunch of us with ADHD.
So I just wanted to put that in there.
Cheers.
Okay, welcome to Breeder Syndicate everyone.
I'm Matthew.
I'm here with my friend, Shawny Kids and NotSoDog.
And we are here with New York Peak.
Was the, I guess you would say owner, runner of Compassion Clubs in the 90s in Canada,
correct?
Yeah, and we're still going.
So I started the, originally it was called the London Compassion Club back in 95?
And then we went public in with Alan Rock.
So that would have been like 97 or so.
And that's when I split off from Hemp Nation and did the Organic Traveler, which was my
retail.
But they call me NYPD just because my name is Petey, Pete, and I'm from New York kind
of thing.
So that's, they don't call me New York Pete, but they call me NYPD.
NYPD.
I'm always scared to lead with that because I remember when the first time I heard it,
I was like, NYPD?
Yeah, I know.
I'm like, peace out everybody.
Well, like where we're from,
And there's a whole bunch of fucking NYPD paraphernalia, like the shirt and the hat
and all that.
Yeah, yeah.
But where we're from, you know, it's like everyone had a nickname.
Like my name is Shawny Kids.
Like Pete has only really known me as Shawny Kids going back to the 90s, right?
Yeah, that's funny.
Yeah.
All of our friends had nicknames.
Everyone had a nickname.
You kind of had to in this industry though, right?
Sure.
I didn't want to say, hey, fucking Shawn, fucking, you know, or Chris Clay or fucking
anybody's real name.
You know,
You were the king of shortening words too.
Oh, I fucking mixed up everybody.
And there's evolutions of people's nicknames that everyone I know has a fucking nickname.
And if something like Bong Boy worked for me for years, no idea what his fucking real
name was.
No fucking idea what it was.
I'll admit that on my birth certificate, it does not say Not So Dog.
Yeah.
But it's like, it's the same thing.
It's tour names.
It's a different nickname.
It's a different way.
You know, for being in a semi shady, you know, quasi what, you know, anywhere from completely
illegal to quasi legal to gray area to maybe, you know.
Yeah.
Like I said, you know, we have we I've always lived in the gray area of the world.
And sometimes it's really dark gray and sometimes it's really light gray.
Right.
Like, you know, I've I've had a deal in the black market because I needed to to suffice
or to satisfy the need of the medical communities that I was part of.
And I couldn't grow enough for everybody.
So and that's really why I started growing pot.
I started growing pot, you know, one not to sell it.
I just wanted to save money.
And when I started Organic Traveler in a, you know, university town, I had the Grow
Your Tuition campaign, which was I would sell you seeds and give you information, sell you
grow guides, come back, come in on any Sunday and we would have grow chats and walk you
through how to do cuttings or start seeds or stuff like that, because money in your
pocket, whether you save it or make it is still money in your pocket.
Right.
Yeah.
No, don't get into this industry.
And I fucking honestly, you know, I won't work with anybody back in the day, especially
when cannabis was illegal.
If your sole income was strictly on growing pot.
If it was strictly on you, you're not going to be in my circle because I think, you know,
if you're doing that's kind of prostituting the plant.
And I've always been a big advocate about, you know, not prostituting this plant, like
use it for what it's meant for.
Right.
Like it was put forth for us to enjoy, not to, you know, bastardize and and prostitute
kind of thing.
So I've made my entire living off of cannabis.
But I also had Organic Traveler, which was a head shop that was legal.
If I got busted, which I have and end up in jail, which I have, and they take everything
that I own, which they did, my rent was still paid and there was still food on my table.
So before I had Hemp Nation, sorry, Organic Traveler or before Hemp Nation, well, Hemp
Nation, I was delivering meat.
I'm a vegetarian.
I was fucking delivering meat every morning from nine or eight in the morning till four
in the afternoon.
Come home to my garden.
And that was my gravy.
My fucking shitty fucking day job.
Put food on my table, paid my rent and then all the gravy in life, my two thousand dollar
bike hanging on the wall, my trips to fucking Amsterdam or California or wherever the fuck
I want to go.
That was great.
That was all from the cannabis.
And it's not from being a dick about it.
I grew a pot.
I would have a harvest party and I'd bring all the staff in from Hemp Nation and I'd
be like, what do you guys want?
I'm honest with you.
I'm charging you double what I charge medical so I can sell it cheaper to the people that
need it over the people that want it.
And you tell me what you want.
You don't have to pay for it.
You will pay for it in time.
But if you want two ounces or three ounces or a QP, that's fine.
I'm going to take the pot.
I'm going to put in one of those containers.
I'm going to stick it in my deep freezer.
And you come to me with a quarter ounce, 50 bucks.
Bring it.
But that pot is there.
It's for you.
I'm not selling it to anybody else.
That could be a generational thing too.
When I felt like where I grew up, at least, it was really important to have some kind
of verifiable income.
Because you had to have some reason of existing.
You had to have some way to make it.
You didn't want to go to court and they're like, how do you support yourself?
And you're like, uh.
And it comes from an era where it had to be a side gig because you needed, even if it
was just a front, like you said, you had no like.
Organic travel was all a front.
I fucking never made money out of organic travel.
I lost it.
When it got to a point of losing about 40 grand a year, I said, okay, we're pulling
the plug.
And by that time, I was doing the Compassion Society for 20 years.
The cops knew what I was doing.
And then Indiva came into play.
As I was closing organic, same thing.
CRA, I had a reason.
And you kind of need to have a reason for, like you said, what people see.
But for me, it's for what I see and what I know.
And I cut ties with some really fucking great growers.
And I cut ties with people that were just fucking assholes.
Their focus was money, money, money.
And when you chase it, you open yourself up to the more vulnerable to be taken advantage
of or get busted or get shady, deal with shady people, shit like that.
I've been pretty lucky.
I've been in this industry a long time.
30, how old am I?
30, 40.
Almost about 35 years.
That I put my name out there and said, hey, I'm a fucking pot guy kind of thing.
London is a pretty conservative place.
It was totally different.
That's why most people went to BC.
Everybody left BC.
And that's why I say, BC grows the best pot.
Of course they do.
They're from Ontario.
Fuck.
I went out to BC.
I lived out there.
And I didn't meet anybody from fucking BC.
I went out there on grow contracts.
But it was what we have here.
It seems like it kind of, I think the marijuana movement started around here.
It did.
And we are in a very conservative town.
And back when I started, we had a very conservative religious mayor.
And I wanted to make a point.
I wanted to make a point.
I wanted to make a point.
I wanted to make a point.
I wanted to make a point.
I wanted to make a point.
I wanted to make a point.
I put up big banners that said,
The Lord believes in marijuana.
Do you believe in the Lord?
And it was not something that she took kindly.
But would not make us think about it.
Because she would be giving me airplay.
But 4 o'clock in the morning,
the fucking paddy wagon showed up.
And took down my fucking banner.
And that's the thing.
You've been doing this a long time.
And all of that.
But the one thing you've been doing
is fighting the law openly.
Since 1993.
Since 1993.
Since 1993.
Since 1993.
Since 1993.
Since 1994.
Since 1994.
Since 1993.
I still talk with Alan Young on a regular basis.
That poor man has been beat the shit up in this industry too.
Who is he?
Alan Young.
Alan Young.
Who is he?
Alan Young is the, I say, the cannabis lawyer in Canada.
So he's the one that handled Chris' case.
So he's the one that handled Chris' case.
So he's the one that handled Chris' case.
His partner, Paul Bernstein,
he handled like Ross Rebo,
Rolla Big Doobie, whatever the fuck his name is.
If you go to the West Coast,
you have John Conroy.
When you hear constitutional lawyers,
you're dealing with Alan Young.
Do you want to explain the whole Chris Clay arrest?
Do you want to explain the whole Chris Clay arrest?
Sure.
I was part of HempBC
I was part of HempBC
but in the shadows, luckily.
So the first time we got raided,
So the first time we got raided,
it was,
it was,
with Chris,
very educated, well-read,
polite kid,
who didn't start smoking pot
until just a few years prior.
Read the law,
the way that the law was read is
it wasn't cannabis that was illegal,
it was THC.
So THC is not in the seeds.
So THC is not in the seeds.
So we started selling seeds.
And that's how I met him.
Because I was going back and forth from New York
to St. Thomas
or London, because I was in college.
And I was bringing seeds back and forth
just trading for genetics.
just trading for genetics.
And so I was helping him
with the little Great Canadian Hemporium
seed fucking company.
seed fucking company.
And then he realized,
well, cuttings don't have fucking THC in them either.
So he took out a
fucking full-page ad
in the, I think it was Scene magazine
that said,
overgrow your government.
And I'm pretty sure that
Chris, well it would have been Andrew
who was the artist, coined that phrase.
That overgrow?
Less overgrow the government.
And it was literally a cartoon
of a seed marching
with a helmet on, with the hemp nation flag on it
holding a bong like it's a gun.
And
we said we're going to sell
30 skunk one
cuttings for
30 bucks or 25
for 25 bucks or something like that.
And I think
by the
seventh cutting or
something along that line
Jordan, who is the
little person I think is the proper name.
Howard the Duck.
Yeah, he was Howard.
Oh, that guy. Okay, I know who you're talking about.
So I just reconnected with him too.
He's back in Toronto.
So he was the one that actually
sold the cutting to an undercover cop.
They must have
brought... Howard the Duck sold the cutting
to an undercover cop.
That's why he was arrested.
So Chris was arrested because he was the owner.
It's his name on the lease.
And Jordan got
arrested because he was the actual one that
did the sale.
And
and
they must have bought the cutting
and then brought it down because they didn't buy it and then
bust them. They bought it and then
came back a little bit later.
I mean Chris would be the better
I mean I was smoking a lot
of pot back then. Chris was smoking a lot.
Actually back then too.
And they all did.
Jordan was like a
little person but he had dreads down to his ass.
He had like a lip piercing.
You know, he was...
Yeah, he was...
It still trips me out. Howard the Duck, bro.
He was only Howard for like
a very split...
He tried to remove a lot of it because he was underage.
He wasn't allowed to be...
I watched a documentary on it the other day on the making of Howard the Duck.
Oh really?
They don't mention him, do they?
Oh yeah, they mention him a lot.
They talk about how they hired him when he was a little kid.
And how they
initially shot a bunch of it with him but the
movements were from the dummy.
They had to remove him.
But you can't tell if it was him or not because
you know...
Can you actually email me that?
Oh yeah, definitely.
It's way worth watching.
He was in something modern too with Colin Farrell.
Yeah, I watched that too.
Oh, and Bruges is a great movie.
That's him. That's Jordan Prentice.
And Bruges!
I hate to say it but I joke with him too.
I was like, listen, you know what? You kind of all look alike.
Because there's so many people
that at times I'm like, fuck, I'm pretty sure that's Jordan.
And they're like, I don't know.
I have to go look at the fucking credits.
They say, oh, it's not him.
You know?
And then Prozac back in the day.
Which was another one of the
kind of...
I wouldn't call him a Klingon because
he was part of the Hemp Nation family.
And obviously Pete Rocks was.
And Pete Miller.
And fucking...
There was a whole bunch of us.
But anyways, getting back to the bust.
They must have took the plant out.
Brought it.
They couldn't have analyzed it.
They just maybe confirmed that it was cannabis.
And came back later that afternoon
and raided the place.
They didn't take any of the seeds.
Didn't say anything about the seeds.
Busted them for paraphernalia.
The 262.2.
And for the
distribution
of
controlled substance.
Back then it would be called
something different back then.
I don't know if it was a PPT.
Like the possession for the purpose.
But anyways,
they cleared out the store.
Fucking made a mess of it.
Basically tried to shut them down.
And maybe they didn't realize
Chris had really supportive parents
that had money.
And believed their son not to be a
criminal like he was treated.
And
the Elmwood house.
We had a
grow house on Elmwood that
everybody lived in except for me.
Because I was delivering meat at the time.
And
you know, they went back
and they went there.
That's where they busted Prozac
and his girlfriend at the time.
And
that was fucking
a shit show of craziness.
Because as soon as the cops busted us, the phone calls
started going.
Everybody that was at the house was literally
running to the basement, grabbing pots.
Running out the backyard.
Throwing them over the back fence into an empty lot.
So by the time the police got there,
there was literally a trail of dirt
through the kitchen, out the back door.
And dirt still on the top of the fence.
I bet.
And they were like, yep, not on the property.
Not our problem.
You know.
So that
was the first bust.
And then, since they
didn't say anything about the seeds,
Chris and I
got a little bit more serious
about it.
And started to
get a little bit more
into the breeding. Buying, like you say,
showing some of these early
scented seed packs and stuff like that.
Anybody that was going over there, mail us
seeds. Right?
When did we start buying seeds?
Did you tell me that you were the first
in Canada to sell?
I think Chris was the first
seed company in Canada.
Because I didn't know of anybody else
that was publicly
selling seeds.
Way before Dark Enemy.
Mike up north.
Mark Henry.
Yeah, Mark Henry. Sorry, Dark Enemy.
Same thing. Dark Enemy.
Yeah, they removed a whole chapter
from my book because they were so scared
that he was going to sue me.
But he's a fucking douche bag.
And then
Mike
up north at
Crosstown, he was early in it.
I don't think Dom ever... No, Dom never
got into the seed thing.
Out west, there was
nobody really
out west that we knew of.
Hemp BC
wasn't even around at this point in time.
So,
as far as I knew,
yeah, it's Chris. Chris was the first one to stick
his fucking little neck out there to
spread the word.
Right? Like to overgrow the
argument. So, you know,
when they busted
him the first time,
they
didn't do anything about the seeds.
So we figured, fuck,
we know where the limits
are. So, fuck, yeah, let's
ball to the wall. Let's get into the seed fucking business.
Let's start spreading the seeds
fucking everywhere.
And we started... That's when I was hired to
work in the store.
And every Sunday I would do
cultivation
or counseling, whatever the fuck they wanted to call it,
with NYPD.
And
it was
a...
It was the point that
we started getting
noticed. And we
started getting people traveling to us.
And then Chris
got on the internet. And
everything back then was raw code.
And started producing the
seed menu online.
And it was
fucking... We were getting more hits.
At one point, if I remember correctly,
he said we were getting more
hits than University of Western
Ontario. That's funny.
I believe it. Right? Because we had
so many fucking people that just
heard, what, you can buy cannabis seeds?
And then, you know, because we were in the newspaper,
sure, they're going to put that in
it. So it gives us credibility of
who we are and what we're doing. Yep.
And then
when they came back the second time,
they offered Chris a
way out.
An option. Yeah.
To
plead guilty to
lesser charges. And
drop the constitutional challenge.
And
basically
sell the seed, sell the pipe, sell the bongs.
We don't care about that. You know.
And Chris came to us and said, it's up to
you guys. I mean, we're a nation.
At this point in time, we were
treating ourselves as a nation. So we
had Minister... I was Minister of Agriculture.
And then we had Minister of Labour,
which was Bill, that took care of all the retail
store and all the
staff.
And then we had Minister
of Education, which was Sarah.
She took care of the library and the
museum and
stuff like that. And Andrew was
the Minister of Defence. He was
our artist, but he was the angriest.
He was...
He's a brilliant... He's a schoolteacher.
I was scared to share him now.
His wife owns From Mars,
which is another staple in this town.
And
you know, so we were set up as a nation.
Kind of thing. We were ready to...
They call it as war on drugs. We were going to
take it as a war on drugs. It's a war.
So we formed our nation and we were ready.
And...
And this is like early 20s
kids, right? Like you're all like in your early
20s, right? No, we were... This was in the 90s still.
This would be the late 90s.
Okay. Yeah. So we were...
Yeah, it would have been like mid-90s
actually. Yeah. Second time.
Because I opened up
Organic in 97.
And
we were already...
And Chris was already banished from Ontario
by that time.
And the thing was, is after
the first raid,
like I said, we went balls to wall with the
seed business.
And that's when we started again.
If you're going through Amsterdam, send a seed
so I can breed them. And
I was doing what...
What the fuck's a big
douchebag in
Amsterdam? Are you on?
No. No. He's a nice
douchebag. Okay.
He's just an arrogant douchebag.
There's so many. No. Yeah.
But he's... This is the most famous. He threatened
to sue us as legends
for when we were entering the cup
with the... He thought we were...
Neville?
No. No.
Neville was always good people.
But we were using Neville's seeds.
Yeah. Yeah. Hank.
Oh, yeah. Dutch fashion.
Hank is the type of fucking guy
that started
doing what we were doing but
being a dick about it.
I would openly say, hey, listen.
We got in 20
seeds of skunk one
from the drunkers
and
I'm open breeding those.
And in the same room,
we had an original haze. We had a black
domino. We had all these other strains.
So, they're F1s.
This is what you're going to get when there's
no guarantees here. Yeah. But
you're growing pot.
Now, you're officially a pot
grower and
they're good genetics.
From where I started, my genetic
selection was from
bags of weed. Yeah.
And New York,
we're not getting the fucking best weed.
We're getting fucking Jamaican brick. When I first
started, we were buying nickel
bags in East Rockaway on
B15, which I think is actually
in a Beastie Boys song.
But
it was for $5 for a nickel bag
and $10 for a dime bag.
We would get
a third of it with seed. It was back when
it was after people were saying
buying it by the lid.
It was like four fingers in a fucking
sandwich bag.
But we were basically going and buying
nickel bags for
$5 and
you would get
a shitload of seeds in it. And if it was good pot,
I would save the seeds.
Right? And I
didn't know what the fuck it was. I didn't know what
sativa was or indica was.
It's all fucking Jamaican
fucking shit weed or
Colombian or whatever. So when we
got certain things and people were like, oh, it's
Ajo Pavo Gold. Okay.
I'm going to keep the fucking seeds because I've heard
that back in the high... reading in
high times magazines. So I started
collecting those
genetics
and I would bring them up to Canada
and I would trade
with Chris.
Right? And he would have his seeds from
here. London is a fucking
phenomenal place
for cannabis for multiple reasons.
One, because we did have the Perth County
conspiracy that was a lot of the
draft dodgers that came to Canada
didn't
want to go too far north
and we're right between Buffalo and Detroit.
And if you look at
the geographic,
we are surrounded by Great Lakes.
So we are a glacial runoff
that all the minerals
and everything got deposited. So our soil
here, that's why we're such a large
farming community. Our soil
is fucking awesome.
Was awesome.
Right? So since we were getting all that
and we're all growing pot
in the fields, in
the fucking... in the corn,
you know, we were growing
some great fucking pot. And
if you got seeds in it, which you
would indefinitely,
get something.
I was happy as fucking shit. People were like
pissed off. Like, oh man, it's got seeds in it. I was like
fucking give me the seeds. No, that's a score, bro.
Let me smell the pot.
Is it worth keeping? You know?
Give me some descriptions.
Grow it out.
See if I could grow it indoors.
You know?
If it came from around here, I knew I could grow
it, most likely grow it outdoors
because there wasn't very many people
growing back then. If they were,
they were using phototrons
and fluorescent
lightings and shit like that.
The HID community
really wasn't taking off.
It was
in the
90s.
In the early 90s,
I was having some
local kids
go and steal fucking lights
from in front of buildings.
Because they were streetlights
or something. Yeah, they were metal halides and
HPS. Yeah, they were HPS and they were either
400s, most likely all 400s.
There wasn't too many thousand watts back then.
Yeah, it was like 250s and 400s and
60s and shit. Yeah, we were trying to
we were growing pot.
Like I said, we were fucking pot growers. We didn't know
what we were growing, how we were growing it,
but fuck, man, it's
a weed. They call it weed for a reason. The more you do
to it, the more you can fuck it up.
Let it do its thing. Give it food.
Give it water. Give it air.
She's going to give you back.
So
by bringing some of
these Jamaican strains from
New York,
which I'm saying Jamaican, which I think it's
going to be. It was brick weed.
So I knew
most likely,
I didn't know back then, but I
learned quickly that
you can't grow it indoors here.
But we can grow it indoors.
People didn't like it because
it was too big, too scraggly, too long.
You know, if anything
they're growing up here, especially all
the pot that came
from the
60s and the 70s
or 60s when the draft dodgers
were coming, and then the 70s when
their kids were getting
old enough or something that
they were growing dad strains.
I just saw
one. Yeah, so it's called
Elmwood and it's
supposed to be this ancient genetic
that is supposed to be fire
for outdoor around here.
So I've seen a lot of
seeds.
Do you know any more history on Elmwood
or is that just basically...
No, all I know is I've wanted
the seed forever because I heard of it.
Yeah. All I knew was
when you get to
northern London,
north London, Lucan,
Exeter, you know, a little bit further
north, maybe not as far as
not as far as Owens Sound, but maybe
kind of in that direction, south of
Collingwood, Owens Sound. This
was the plant that everybody grew
because it was massive.
Was it
the best?
Don't know, but you know,
we would have people that
grew like this. This strain is called
Berry Berry. Actually, you know what? This is
Berry Berry. It's a... And it was my
first centifold in high times.
What's in it? It was just a fucking
seed that a guy came in and says
this is the fucking bomb.
Wow. Alright, let's try it out.
We grew it out. It was... Had to be like
an F1
because it was all over the place, but
it would fucking turn into something like this.
I was just like,
this is fucking awesome. And we didn't
have a fucking name for it.
He's like, God, it smells like
it might be a blueberry. I'm not calling
it blueberry.
It's called Berry Berry. Alright.
It gets the idea.
You know?
I was going to ask you...
I was curious,
when did you first start, or
when did you first make contact with high times
and start working with high times?
Kyle
found me
Cushman?
Yeah.
I like to put that out. I actually sent him an email
because he's out in fucking the
Oakster damn shit
spreading the
what does he call it now?
The plant chiropractic or something
like that. It's super cropping, right?
And it's an article
that was the first article
and it was like a grower's
interview or whatever
on me.
I didn't make it up.
I was shown by some growers
in this area.
I made sure it was in the article saying
it's fucking
phenomenal technique for people that
are growing indoors that want to grow
certain strains certain ways
and don't want to have fucking
50 plants. You can have
two plants, three plants
and still get two pounds.
Yeah.
It's going to take a little bit longer, but
the strains obviously work better for it.
But it's manipulating and training
plants to
grow in a certain way.
And
so when Kyle came
through, so long
story short, the other thing with him teaching
this I was like, how did you learn
this? I don't
want him to acknowledge me, but I want him to
acknowledge the lineage of
the history of this
technique because
people deserve
the recognition.
It's not like they say their fucking names.
Yeah. Yeah. But especially because
I don't talk to either of them anymore. And the one guy is
the biggest dick in this fucking town
when it comes to anything in
general. But he showed me this
technique that fucking
got me recognized.
They flew me to the Cannabis
Cup to talk about. It was just talking
about Canadian cultivation
techniques and it was super crappy.
And then they did the same thing with Soma
five years later or something.
So anyways, Kyle
was living in Detroit
at the time.
And
he was coming
from maybe Toronto or something.
And
he must have heard about
either the seeds
or me or
something. Can you hear
that beeping periodically? Yeah.
That's my diabetic thing.
Oh, it's okay.
And
he just popped in the shop
one day at organics and
struck up the conversation and
we hit it off. And then
he would come back
and I would
him and his boys, we called the Detroit
Danksters.
Great growers back there.
Sally is still
there. Big John, I think, is gone.
But that was
his crew, his boys.
Super good, super talented
growers in Detroit.
But they liked the
fucking Canadian pot.
They were coming through
London and I would
invite them basically to
the Hemp Nation family.
So I was like, listen, if you guys want
you're paying 200 bucks an ounce
but you're paying US, not
Canadian.
And I was happy
with that. They were fucking
stoked because they were paying
$300, $400 an ounce in Detroit
at the time. And I
just said, I'm selling to you.
You do what the fuck you want with it.
We didn't have vac sealers back then.
We were just fucking, I was taking
freezer bags
or taking Ziploc bags, throwing them in
freezer bags and then another
freezer bag and then baking soda
or dryer sheets and then
fucking Ziploc.
And the way that we got it
across was they
would have a friend
come across, go to Windsor, to the
casino and the boys
would, like a guy would bring his girlfriend
not tell her what was happening
and they would go
the night for the casinos. The boys, the
gangsters were paying for all of it.
They were fucking, if
they could stay the night, do whatever.
And the boys would
go there with a key
to the
guy's trunk. Didn't even fucking
hide it. Like just fucking a
bag in the fucking back.
And then
would drive across the border with
nothing. And then the
next day, the buddy would wake up,
drive across,
got all the paraphernalia from the fucking
casino, spent the night, had dinner,
you know, that's it.
Didn't buy anything, didn't do anything to the casino.
Just fucking go through, no problem.
We did that for
fucking years.
And then I found out just
a few years ago that
when they
went across to come by,
come back here, they were
asked if they were coming to see me
by name
at the border. And they
were just like, okay,
like yeah, he's
like, turn around.
Coming from the Windsor crossing?
Yeah, coming from Windsor.
And now I
had a run in
with the Windsor
border, coming
back from a photo shoot
for High Times, where I
met with Kyle
and the Danksters
and
oh god, another photographer.
Fucking most, I think
the most famous
photographer back in the
90s, early 2000s.
God damn it.
He was there doing,
he was shooting also. But anyways,
I was meeting with Kyle, so I brought
all my photos. It was right after
I got back from Switzerland, so I
had all my Swiss photos, I had my
Amsterdam photos.
And I got
Was this in the early
2000s then?
Because you said Switzerland.
I was in Switzerland in 2000.
Switzerland didn't really
get going. I don't think I
was at the cup, and I think I did the cup in
No, I did the cup
Quit Smoking Pot
2000, yeah, it would be 2000.
It would have been 2000.
So when I
that's what I was meeting, I would imagine
that's what I was meeting Kyle for, because I brought all
my photos, which
always meant pictures,
which I just basically used as proofs,
and then slides, because that's what
the magazine wanted, and
then video, because
I wanted to
document
the shoots.
So when they pulled me, and I was driving
my girlfriend at the time had a
1969
Volkswagen bus.
And I had
crazy
dreads that were probably just
about my shoulder length, but they were still
just finishing developing.
So they were all over the fucking place.
I was like, you know what, I'm not
crossing with anything. Definitely
would never cross with any fucking pot or anything
like that. And
got pulled over.
And they said, you know, we're
searching the vehicle. Sure, I guess
I got a pot leaf on my fucking shirt.
And they said, Do you have any drugs on you?
I was like, Listen, this is how I tell you. My name's Pete
Young. I'm from London, Ontario. I own
Organic Traveler, which is a marijuana
fucking paraphernalia shop.
And
I can't make it any easier than that.
Like, no, I'm dumb, not stupid.
Nothing illegal kind of thing.
And they
said, Okay, well, we're going to search the vehicle and make
you stand out, stand in front.
And I watched the guy go
around to the back, and he's a younger custom agent.
And he holds up the
first slide, and you just see his eyes go
fucking this big. Oh, I bet
he thought he found the mother load. Yeah.
And I was like, Oh, fuck. So
I walk around and I approach him and said, Hey,
listen, you know, not sure
how the law is here. I kind of have an
idea that you're allowed to
look through anything. But
there's people's likeness in
these photos that I do not have model
releases for. So legally,
I can't show anybody. Right.
And he explained, Yes, you're right.
You have absolutely no fucking rights here.
We're allowed to look at every
fucking photo, every negative
for pornographic material.
And he's like, Do you have
any pornographic material? I was like,
fuck no. I was like, it's all pot.
It's like, it's me pot, my dog and pot, me, my
dog and pot. I was like, there might be a couple
titties.
There might be models that are holding cannabis
and stuff like that, but nothing pornographic.
And he's like, okay.
I had
fuck, not hundreds, but thousands,
if not
maybe 10,000
photos, negatives in that
van. Because I brought
everything. Yeah.
Because that was the money cow for me for
high times. They loved it.
And I didn't get paid for all the pictures.
A lot of it came into the Grow
America because Kyle needed
photos to put into Grow America.
And I say, okay, I'm going to donate
this many, but you're paying me for this
many. Right. Like if I got a centerfold,
I got 600 bucks. If they got a full
page, I got 300 bucks.
So it
made sense for me to do this.
Anyways, maybe that's
he opened
up another box and literally thousands
of photos and he's looking
at them and it's like pot. And I was like, oh, you want to see some
really nice ones? I start pulling out pictures from
Switzerland, which
is fields of pot.
Not just like a backyard full,
but a fucking hectares.
Yeah. And I was like,
oh, and he's like, where's that? I was like, well, that's
Switzerland. Some are Amsterdam. I was like, some are here.
Some are there kind of thing.
Never said they're from Canada. Never said
they're from the States kind of thing.
And he just
opened up another box and he's like, is it
all pot? It's like every single picture in here is pot.
He's like, why do you have all this?
And luckily at the
same weekend, they were having
one of their
big rave convention party
kind of thing. I forget what they called it.
They had a specific name. And I was like, oh,
I'm coming back from there. And we
set up a booth to show
people to use
cannabis because
you don't have to have it tested for fucking
bad drugs.
Right? And they had them
at these concerts or at
these parties where if you got a pill,
they would go and they'd scratch off a little bit
of it and they would test it and say, yeah,
it is MDMA or
it's some speed
or whatever. They would be able to tell you
maybe not what's exactly in
it, but they could more or less
tell you what's not in it.
I just made up that bullshit literally
on the whim that I was coming from
that. And I had all
the pictures that's just put out on display
to show the show kids not
to smoke pot. Don't fucking
do drugs. Don't do hard drugs.
They bought it. They liked it.
I fucking gave him one of my fucking
credit cards said, hey, listen, I offer
25%
off any officer.
So if you ever want
or you want to pipe a bong, anything like that,
you know, just show them your badge.
You get fucking you get discounts. So
that was one of the techno festivals in Detroit.
Yeah. Yeah. And it was they were big
back then.
I mean, I wasn't trying
to interrupt or anything like that. But one of the
ways that we used to regularly go into
Canada
that
we used to go like in especially in the
Detroit scene with Windsor being right there.
There was parties that were thrown in Canada.
Yeah. Right. And there
was a lot of border crossings. Well, they learned
like what hippies and ravers looked
like and they didn't like.
So we used to drive across the border
there wearing like dockers
and polo shirts and all
normal and all of our like real clothes
were like stuffed in the trunk
of what we normally looked like because we were
trying to go back and forth and look
like the biggest nerds ever.
Right. Because if you
you know, if you looked a certain way
you're going to get you're going to get checked
out on a certain level. And I
didn't have that option. I had fucking dreads.
And you know, like I
did the opposite. I was just like
I'm driving a Volkswagen bus.
Okay. I got a pot leaf on my shirt
and I got fucking dreads. Now
I'm born in New York
and I live in Canada.
So I have a passport for both.
They can't deny me wherever
I'm going to the States
no matter what I look like.
They can't deny me because I'm only using my
passport when I come back to Canada.
I'm not telling them that I have a passport
for the States or vice versa.
I show them the fucking Canadian passport.
Right. Right. Can't deny me. I know
I look like somebody that you don't want to let
in your country, but I'm a citizen
of the country. You don't have a choice.
So it makes a big difference.
I didn't know you're in the States now.
Yeah. Okay.
I mean,
I have
an uncle
that does the same thing. He has Brazilian
citizenship and he's
American as well.
When he goes into Brazil,
he uses Brazilian. When he comes back
into the US, he uses American. So it looks like he never
goes anywhere, but he's bouncing back and forth
constantly.
He just uses...
But yeah, I just remember
especially in the Windsor area because Detroit
was right there.
As the years and the 90s
went on, they definitely started
you know, I don't know
if you want to like what, you know,
profiling, if you will.
They had an image of what hippies looked like
or what herb smugglers
looked like or what ravers looked like
or what each one of these groups
was likely to have on them or whatever.
You know? I always tell
people that
I kind of followed a
certain
mathematical
equation for lack of better terms, right?
The police know that
what to look for, right?
If you're
in this industry.
So there's going to
be 90%
of our
community
is susceptible
to getting
busted because of
the way they look, the way they smell, the way
they walk or talk, right?
There's 5% on either side.
The 5% of the
people in the movement
or industry that
never leave their house, they
don't go to the grow shop themselves, they send
somebody to send somebody to go
buy the fertilizer, go buy their
seeds, go buy what they want, and then
that person, whoever purchased this
has no idea
who the person is that placed the order
kind of thing. That person is
never going to get busted.
It's going to be very unlikely that they get
busted. And then the other 5%
is where I fall in. I stand on the
street corner with a fucking 6-foot pot leaf
with my dreads out in my Volkswagen
going, I'm a fucking
pot guy. They don't
want that. They know who I am.
They know what I'm doing.
90%
of the other people out there are susceptible
to fill their quota.
Why the fuck do we want to drag
in the dreadlock who's going to have the newspapers
there? So they're like, we'll
leave him alone. So I'm in that 5%
on the opposite side.
Because I literally had
a 6-foot pot leaf in my front window.
I literally did have pot plants growing
in my front window. And for a
certain time, my whole front window was full
of fucking peyote and San Pedro's.
That's so funny. Didn't you also
do stuff like call the newspaper and
they would run an article where you take them to like a
cornfield. Oh no, that was
like CBC and shit. I brought
news agencies to my field,
my crops. Let me throw out a question
before I lose the thread of it. When you
met Kyle, did he
have a strawberry
cough then? Did you ever hear any of that?
The cough came out of Connecticut, right?
So those boys,
do you know who those guys are?
I know of them. I don't know.
Basically,
this is another thing with Hank, douchebag.
The
cough, they named it.
Kyle fucking
said, you know,
make some cough. It smells like
strawberries, whatever the fucking deal was.
Kyle was with
HT at the time.
And
he
met the cough guys when
I was
still
hanging around with him.
Never got to meet them.
They were different. I was
actually, I had a warrant out for my arrest
in Connecticut, so I wasn't
going to go to Connecticut.
No reason to be hanging out in Connecticut.
No, there's no reason to go to fucking Connecticut.
It was a speeding ticket.
It was a 145
mile per hour speeding ticket.
So I never went back and I was like,
you know, whatever. But he told me
about it and it seemed
like a great strain. Now, I had strawberry diesel
and I was like,
what strawberry are they using?
Did you give them
my strawberry by chance?
You know,
I never really got down that.
I never went down
that rabbit hole to figure out
what it was. But from what I understand,
from what Kyle told me, he's just like
they
hit the money shot with a
plant that produced
this fucking fire pot.
It was fucking phenomenal.
And
fucking
out of my mind. Do you know what was in the strawberry diesel
you were running at the time?
No, no, no.
Just because it was brought
to me as. Because the
cough itself did start in Connecticut
and I got introduced to it. It made
its way out to Colorado through people
who went from Connecticut to Colorado.
Kyle has always been a
little bit shit. You know, he dances
around origin stories
because it's like one of the things that because
he worked for high times, he got pretty well known
for, you know? Yeah. And so
as he's tried to become like a can of celebrity,
some of the origin stories
of the things that he's known for, he's gotten
pretty, you know, pretty
vague. Well, I mean,
because the fucking douchebag,
he sold the cough to fucking Hank.
Right? That's
why he's the strawberry cough seed was
produced. Yeah. It's because
fucking and I don't know
if the Connecticut boys got even a piece of it.
Right. Probably
because and like when
when Kyle and I when I
dissolved my friendship with him
was we're in
Amsterdam in the middle of one
of these squares, me fucking screaming
at him about him
backstabbing me
kind of thing over a common story.
Yeah. And I was just like, what the fuck
is wrong with you? Like, you know, he's
a fucking skinny little Jewish
kid from New York. He's from New York, right? Yeah.
Yeah. And
and I
was like, I know you did it to the
cough boys, but you didn't know that. Right. They
were just some fucking kids that you've
met that called
you because they have some fucking great fucking
pot. He got
Kyle got famous
because of the Kyle special blend
fucking picture.
The hell's the name of the photographer?
I don't remember the names of the photographers
from now. I will remember for
for a bit. He was a super
fucking nice guy. Super great guy.
And that pissed me off. And then
he tried to
he tried to
put like I was
finished my first tour in
Switzerland and I was contemplating
if I should go back or not
because Steve is a hard person
to fucking work with. They want bread
from this town, right? Okay. So
he I didn't know him
when he lived here, but I
met him through
Steve before legends.
Yeah.
I don't know who I met first. Actually, I think
I don't know if I met. I don't
know who I met them all around the same time. I
think. Right. And they were all
out in Vancouver
Red and Jare.
He called himself Kermit for a while
were brokers
growers. Not
not breeding. Yeah. Legends
started in Switzerland, right? Like
it started with the
the Louis and
and that was just a
freak
thing that happened with the Ortega. That's
what he said. Yeah. Yeah. And
and but so anyways, yeah.
So I know
them is Steve
Steve's fucking
wick is fucking
this fucking long. Yeah. And
if he if you if he's
pissed off like
when we were in Amsterdam and
fuck out to start work.
Sorry, my memory is fucked now, but
is this the fast spear story?
No, fast. Fear is my
fucking story. The fucker
he took my metal because of my fast
fast fatty was a strain that
Hank threatened to sue us over. Yeah.
Right. Because he went back. Hank came
through Switzerland, saw heard that we
were going to enter all these strains
and he's like, well, I worked
on these strains. So they're mine. He went back
to fucking Amsterdam and registered all the fucking
names. And when we showed up
he at the dinner
right before
high times is all that with all the people.
He came up to our table, said, hey, listen,
if you're thinking about entering these strains,
I'm going to sue you unless you get.
And so red had to go up, make a side deal
like, OK, we're going to give you a percentage.
But the fucking douchebag, he
wrote down fast fatty.
I brought fast beer.
Those guys hated fast beer
fucking name. Why?
They knew they were all Ortega. They were all
big fucking Indica fit freaks.
Yeah. They didn't fucking work in
the field. You know, red did a little
bit, but I was there for fucking months.
You know, Papa Bear came out there, sat
in the fucking hammock, smoked joints and
fucking, you know, waited and
thought he was the fucking the king.
We we bred sweet tooth.
Yes. Strawberry blonde.
The Louis.
I think it also we just basically we had
a we had.
30 maybe.
600 watts in a room.
Mainly we just doing cuttings because the
company is called Mr.
Hemp that Steve was working with.
And it was just it was right after they got
busted for the selling pot to a minor.
But we still had the
we still the facility in Lugano.
And we
ended up just taking
a mail and smacking
it against the fan in the corner.
Yeah. Pollinated the whole.
Like you couldn't barely see through the
fucking room. And so
some of my seeds here someplace
called the Blonde Bastard
and the Blonde Bastard was
was a strawberry blonde
crossed.
And they didn't want to do anything
with it. So I ended up keeping
it.
What was the strawberry blonde?
Do you remember what was in there?
See this is what I
remember with Steve
is he
he had a whole bunch of strains
that were good.
And I like this here is
a big funk
which is one of his strains.
And then the strawberry
sorry the sweet tooth number four.
Gotcha.
I'm pretty sure I get Steve
would be better to
understand. And I think part of this
is
correct. And part of it might be
just my interpretation
of it. But I believe
that he had a bunch of strains
that were
or he had he had one strain
or he had a few strains that he
thought were fucking great.
And he found that fucking resonance
blueberry mail.
He crossed everything.
He crossed everything with it.
Now it was my
understanding is when he got the
the sweet pink grapefruit
cutting. Yes.
California two cuttings came up
to Vancouver Vic
who I'm pretty sure that's the guy's name.
Not sure he was.
It didn't get the best reputation with the
boys. Yeah.
One cut and
Steve got one cut.
Are you talking about Vic High?
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah. So but I don't know who he is.
Like he's no longer with us.
OK. Well you're good.
You have your best reputation.
Yeah. Right.
But I have a feeling
Steve took that blueberry mail
and the sweet and the
sweet pink grapefruit
and
crossed him
and then grew out a bunch of the different
seeds and one
became sweet tooth one became
big big tree
one became you know this
one's called Big Funk but that's not his original
seed.
Big treat was one of them.
Something but
I know I have the same someplace.
I just don't know where the fuck they are.
But I have a feeling that Steve
ended up with
a bunch of different phenols
of that those two strains
and that's what he started building
his catalog off of.
Yeah. And then you know the sweet tooth
which was one of his more
favorite.
I know he wanted to back
cross it
maybe to that same blueberry
or to the grapefruit
and that kind of took different
lines like
stuff like that.
Yeah. So he had the he
had two different shish kaberis.
Yeah. The red line
and yellow the yellow.
Yeah. And you know so
I don't know
you know did that come from
a dip because that you know he
was pretty famous for growing these
big huge long fucking spears.
Shish kaberis right.
There's a picture of his wife holding
them and they're like fucking three
feet long of just straight
great coal is kind of you
know and
I think you know so
I have a feeling that maybe
the
seeds were all from
the same
same crosses but just different
phenotypes that
he
started
creating new lines
and I think
the sweet tooth and the shish kaberi were
the ones that really stood out
the strawberry blonde the big
tree the plum bud
one but that I just saw that it was
a yeah that was a and
I know I have that too.
I'm sure I have all these fucking seeds
someplace man I'm blind as shit though.
Plum I see plum crossed a mighty
might that was West Coast seeds but
yeah there's the plum bud
it described it a little bit saying that
it smelled very fruity but it didn't go
into detail.
No.
This Gabriella Island I got
yeah.
I would kill to see that collection.
I bet you have some cool stuff in there that
I have no idea like it because I keep
track of everything but I just write it down
and not think about it anymore.
Super yeah.
You know like this pungent skunk
from legends right like
what is that I don't even fucking
think we even sold that strain right
you didn't know no
and it was just one of the genetics
that you know we grew out that we
liked.
This is from Camille.
What the hell is this fucking strain
cows cows are
colors are Kelly's are so that's a
C4 is like a Cali
Cali I like to see for didn't
produce worth a shit but it fuck was a good
train so like Cali Oshkosh
barrier or something like that yeah
yeah.
So again you can't
if I even bring up that name with Papa
Bear forget about it like a
fucking it's like with red and Steve
you just can't mention and those guys were
brothers like
fucking back here
you know I don't know what it means
Steve like did you know him before
you got invited to go to the Alps
no I didn't
I knew him before then
first time I did opium I was in his
fucking at one of these places
fucking
freaking out in his hot tub
I didn't know how the fuck I met him. I mean
I was a pot guy here he was from
here he probably got
out there through Hillary
and he
how did you get the invitation to go to
Switzerland
yeah Steve's a picky guy I mean you
had to have done something to leave an impression
because I remember you told
me that fucking guy paid me
$2,100 a week to fucking
go there Jesus yeah
I was like that and then
it dropped down to and then fuck
that Steve right I didn't get paid that
much yeah fucking pot
in Switzerland as a Canadian
they're like you know
fucking the industry is not what it was
and you know if I can I'm
I brought all the fucking pot
to Amsterdam from Switzerland
that's with it for the cup
right yeah and what kind
of you know I'm a little bent by it
now I guess I always have been
but they were all Ortega
they were not one they didn't want
anything to do with the fucking
fast beer yeah right
I was all fast beer because
I was in the field every day working I
couldn't smoke Ortega I fucking
it would puddle me yeah well I would
I was all about the fucking
night queen and the fast
beer and now these strains are all
strains from Neville
yeah these street seeds
came from
little Eddie douche bag sorry
I don't like a lot of people which one
which one
no oh
nobody likes him no but
so the deal was he
was hired by Mr. Hemp at the same time
that Steve was and he
brought all these seeds
that Neville owed him
the story was Neville owed him
owed him a bunch of money
and instead of paying
him he found a fucking
box of seeds in the back
of a freezer
when he had to jump ship
and
gave them to Ed as
payment partial payment whatever so
those seeds ended up in Switzerland
they ended up in the field and we had
that's where the Neville that's where the
the night queen the fast
fatty fast beer Ortega
Neville's Hayes probably goes from there
I don't think we had Neville's
Hayes in our field
we had strains I never heard of
right these are all strains no one's ever
heard of gotcha yeah they were
they were in a freezer they were
they were a box
that Neville sold
to somebody I mean I meant to
talk to Neville about this
before he passed that
and it was like
five years ago six years
ago I had another a new contact
through the Mr.
hemp seed thing
and I never got a chance to talk to
him about it what do you want to ask him
it was more about the history
of this box of seeds okay
and what year was a box of seeds
that's what I'm not sure but I could tell you
that they were still viable
in in
2000
yeah
9-9 probably the
story was that
somebody
ordered these seeds
never picked them up
so they got forgotten about
in the back of the freezer
when
time came for him to
throw out the freezer for whatever reason
he passed them on to
Ed for again what I
was told for an outstanding debt
and
Ed brought them to Switzerland
and Steve planted him
and then Ed had a falling
out with Peter with
Mr. hemp and
he was gone and I was brought
in to replace him and
I they actually gave me his phone I
still had his phone
when I got there which I think is one of the
reasons why because it was still in his name and I was calling
Canada and all over the fucking I was sitting
in a field in the middle of the Swiss Alps yeah
why not I was like fuck it like I don't
particularly care for the guy anyways yeah
and so that's what
I heard did you
did you have any old
early Pearl early girl silver
Pearl stuff yeah back in the
back in the early days
of sensei yeah
and they see this
is the other thing again you know
we hear so many stories
and you know regardless
of who the stories are from you know we
went out to dinner with the drunkards a few times
um
uh Sativa sisters
um
god Jesus
beautiful girl tell
she's out of the business no she's still in the business a little
bit um
the Amsterdam seed company
uh okay
they were out of Canada though right yeah
out of BC yeah I have their catalog
Karen Karen
was a blonde and then big tit with the black
gray hair that sold everybody
out um
I forget her name she's kind of still in
the you say big tit
yeah she's got big titties
she was uh Karen's partner
in the Amsterdam
she's infamous out out in the in the
in the uh seed industry
what were you gonna say about the Pearl
and the okay so back back
then um
when it
wasn't the sensei seed
bank it was just the seed bank yeah
yeah right so that would be before Neville
sold his stuff to sensei it was just yeah
yeah yeah so it would have been Neville
now I thought it was a partnership
between Neville
and Ben that was uh that
was after seed bank
I thought that was that's what
brought the end of the seed bank I thought it was
that's when sensei seed started
I don't what was it the bus
that that uh made Neville sell to
to drunkards I don't know
I don't know I just know that
basically
the story on what basically the story
was told that
Neville was the breeder for
a sensei seed bank he did breed for them
for a little bit so but
you know it was all of his
genetics yes that he was breeding
yeah so when
when the first um
catalogs were coming out of
the sensei seed bank you had early
Pearl you had silver Pearl in
them we loved it
because again we were dealing with
genetics that were
um
from Neville like these were these were the
original fucking strains like I mean
other than like the skunk and the northern
lights yeah you know
we were um
oh I just had the name too
uh fuck
that's damn
it
there was a coffee shop who's who
entered the sweet tooth
um before
Steve was that gray
area or someone no it wasn't gray
bluebird bluebird
cafe yeah
who owned that do you know cat super cat
to bluebird I don't know who owned that
I think it was
I should look it
up but anyways that's the one that
Steve tried it was gonna fireball
because uh we're
talking about like Steve's fucking temper
yeah like it was Ariane
and um and
Luke and everybody else that was trying to
and the drunkards are trying to calm him down because
they and it wasn't
bluebird
they entered
the can't they entered
sweet tooth in the cannabis cup
and without Steve's knowledge
or permission oh man
I mean it was it was a
coffee shop though it was
no it was a seat it was both they had a
coffee shop see but they were also
a seed company Barney farm electronics
Barney's farm Barney's
Barney's sold they still
sell sweet tooth yeah yeah so it was Barney
but see the the should have done
it the uh that guy's like
fucking from what we were told
again from the other guys
big fucking
um Netherlands mafia
yeah yeah yeah Gary yeah
and they were like you
gotta tell him Steve you can't do it if you go
there you know it's he's gonna kill you
it's gonna be a fucking you fuck because Steve
is a big
guy yeah I've never seen him
fight but I wouldn't want to see
him fight yeah he would fight in a
fucking heartbeat yeah and
um you know
so um
but yeah fighting
fighting the mob is not like no
it's just like taking a knife to a gun fight
he was gonna go in there and literally firebomb the fucking place
like he was like fucking really shit
Gary sucks kind of shit right
so so anyways um
so again this is like
again where you know
where we're like fucking the elders
uh sitting in a teepee trying to
regurgitate stories
and we kind of go by what
we're what we hear and what we're told kind
of thing some of us get to witness
it firsthand some of
us hear it regurgitated
once or twice
and we never know so that's why like
with like I say with those seats from
you know the this fast beer this
night queen you know this fast
fatty these and there's a whole bunch of other fucking
strains in there that
you know I
was I was told this story and it
it anybody that I reach out
to and and hear pieces from they
kind of connect a little bit they
kind of sound similar so
about them being seeds from Neville and stuff like that
yeah for the time most
time he was based on his
one of the things that Neville
mentions a bunch is that it seems like
90% of what he made he
never released in the
sense that he had strains that he liked that
got put on the catalogs but he'd make
hybrids of all kinds of things
right and only a tiny percentage of those
things ever got offered up
an actual sale
we wouldn't um
we wouldn't
uh breed I wouldn't
breed anything without somebody else's
permission
unless it was a
publicly you know
um
available one anybody can buy seeds from
like Sensitive Seed Bank you know
I would breed and not think about
now with Luke
I wouldn't do that because
you know he's very particular well
he was small and same as
uh um you know
so the small one same as Soma
yeah um I
wouldn't uh I wouldn't breed any of his stuff
unless I would you know
I kind of asked him
and even with this like
with all my genetics my
B93
I don't want to I can't sell that strain
people I was offered a lot
of money for it I'm working out a deal right now to
trade somebody for it
but it's going to be and it's just
because I want Sam Skunk
um
um I have
an opportunity to get one of the original
Skunk one cuts back
when we were
and Sean I think you were in town with that fucking
that epileptic
asshole kid yeah
which one? Tilly
so this is just this kid that
thrills was yeah so he was brought
to me by the TCC
the Toronto Compassion Centre
said listen we have this kid
uh he's uh he's a good grower
um but he's
mixed up with the wrong people we need to get him out
of this town can you take him
brought him and his mom and his sister to London
set him up in an apartment set up
a garden the whole bit
turned out to be a great gardener
um but it went to his head
and then shit course
that original story never
finished I think
he's still dwelling in that reality
where he was always
a go super big kind of guy
and then getting in
business with really bad people
and it would always go very very very bad
he left out west like as soon as he left here
because it happened over and over and over
you know and like he would
always be like like when when he
would get fucking destroyed
he'd be like I'm never growing again I'm never growing
again and then he's like buying or
he's involved in these like giant
farm chicken coops filled
you know like
it's you know when I when I met him
we he was
because of his
and his mom I loved his mom
and his sister
but they had no control
so they would
we would grow he would grow a bunch
of pot for the center I would
give them a receipt and then I would give
them a certain amount every week
or every month because if I gave
all the money to tell you which I did in a
few times he went out and literally bought
$200 worth of candy
yeah and I
come to his house and he's like I
was like where's the money you were supposed to pay your hydro bill
oh fuck man he's like
he literally had bags of fucking candy
and his mom you know well not just that
but I remember the dude would be
like stretches long stretches
of time where all he would eat is
like lobster dipped in butter or something
like that like he was just that type
of guy that was like it was always
extreme like he was just spending
like like crazy
that was after me because I didn't allow that
then he started hanging out with Egg Boy
yeah yeah
right they got fucking busted in my truck
yeah with 480
plants or something and
I get sucked into it my dad got
sucked into it because it was his truck
you know and I was just like and then they drop
off a vehicle because
we switch vehicles
turns out to be stolen
so I'm driving around in a stolen fucking Jeep
Cherokee oh that sucks
really fucking douche bags
but that skunk won the whole reason the story
he had
we had him growing the
Black Domino and the skunk won and this
skunk won I had
again it just landed
in my lap through all these connections
I would imagine it would have came
from the early
days yeah but it
was that fucking real skunk
and it was a fine Dutchman
I think it was
his name Scott
that makes fine Dutchman's Eddie
Eddie right yeah and it was
a common name yeah so he was supposed to be one
of the original skunk
sellers of the
yeah and so
he had like some of the
more pure
genetic his were called the pure
yeah and I'm you know
what I just saw that here too
yeah you have an old
skunk one pack in there no I have the old
pure oh yeah the pure I still have an
old pack of pure myself yeah
probably not as old as yours though
um
not so missed out on some of the seed pack
showing you missed out bro I did
yeah there's some cool stuff
did I just lose you
I just hit a button on my fucking computer no you're good
black actually Black Domino
was out of anything that I personally
popped from Amsterdam as far as seeds
that were available to the public
that was the nicest thing I
personally found do you remember
the uh the description they were like
it would leave a man
feeling whipped and something
like the description that the
that the boys put in there
yeah full blooded indica
with large racks will soon have you on
your knees and begging for more
harsh overpowering lady simply
gushes sticky resin to which most men
seem to have a fatal attraction
word of warning this powerful compact indica
has had devastating effect on many a man
leaving them apparently beaten and
whipped with a strange smile on their faces
not so usually looks like this
after he gets done with the conversations with me though
yeah I love that
kind of stuff and uh
when we uh when
Ron was doing the Canadian
cannabis cups here in town
and we had the red devil
I kind of stole that kind of
mantra from from
that to describe the red devil
yes making up a bunch
it was a fucking fire strain it was great strain
it was a bunch of bullshit that I was saying
but um I love
that's the first time I saw a red devil
I believe it was greenhouse
that came out with that
or at least they were the first people to sell
public seeds of it yeah
see the red devil I
ended up getting was
from an alcoholic
guy that was a good grower
from around here
but uh
um
is this
red devil yeah greenhouse it's in your catalog
and uh yeah
Afghan skunk
and I've always wondered if
like Shanti doesn't still
I've never known it but like if
if you know if he tries
to sell a version of that
based on you know because he sells devil
but they've never explained what the fuck it is
right yeah I heard that too I heard about
the devil but I don't know
if it's uh and again the red devil
was a cutting brought to
me sure and um
it we just had a fucking
great vino of it and
I was friends
with fucking crazy Ron
that hidden jungle which was a seed
company in one of the original seed companies
actually it was before iron
iron seeds
but uh but uh
yeah we entered the red
devil in his cannabis
cup and it won first place
you know I fixed it
did you keep much willie jack stuff around
no
yeah he was one that was doing like a lot of early
girl and black dollar repro
black lady um
he was from around here too right but he
did his breeding in he was from Ontario
but he did his breeding in Montreal
no it's Willie Jack yeah that's
what we're talking about okay Willie Jack yeah
did you ever see Willie Jack how he did
his fucking breeding I know nothing
about Willie Jack I get a lot of questions about him
yeah I bet you want to like literally
I did a lot with the Quebec
seed company that was his
fucking guy um
and again I can't remember his name but he did a
cannabis cup there as well
and uh
Willie would basically
in his backyard along his fence
line again this is what I was
told he would
grow a male and a female
and then five feet
10 feet apart another a different male
and different female sounds about right
so you were buying a seed
and his seed was 30 bucks for
mixed packs
yeah but he was saying oh this is Northern
Lights oh this is this train this is this train it's like
no it's not he has no fucking clue
it might have some of that in it be honest
with the people you only charge you $30 a
fucking 10 pack yeah you don't need to
make shit up yeah you know fucking
tell people that
this is what I did this is how I breed it I'm only
charging you 30 bucks you know
but I didn't I didn't like him I
didn't think I thought he was kind of dishonest
well yeah I mean if that's
that's how he was doing his shit it's obvious that
like you know the cross pollination is gonna occur
you know
that's not cool
so
what's that what are some of the posters behind
you before I forget
um
oh this is a chemo
I've seen before that the
the one chemo and now
I think it's the
fuck I don't
even remember I know one of them
went pink and I'm pretty sure
it was the Ottawa
cut that went pink
could be the UBC one but
basically the Ottawa one is probably just
a UBC
that was pollinated
this is a Spice of Life
strain too but I don't know who the fuck Eric is
fuck is Eric
um so this is
so let me just
get this seed pack back in there
and I don't mind
sending you a bunch of these seeds if you want to fucking try
yeah me and a good
friend will try reproducing any of the pop
happily
it's so fucking cool
UBC chemo poster
yeah it was
a fucking centipede in my head
oh no shit I'm just gonna pick
this up so this here is
where's the camera
there we go
so this here is
the beriberi oh nice
so and it actually
says it in the upper corner
and then
sorry I have to try to get this so this here
is the chemo
it might be the Ottawa because it's pink
yeah I think it is
and again you know this is what I've
been told but it's super nice because it's super
pink yeah it's beautiful
um I
have tons of fucking photos of it
dude I see you know I told people for years
like chemo sounded cool but
like and everybody always said they liked it but the name
always turned me off yeah well
again the theory that they
the history was like the G13
yeah that it came out of California
and it was used
for medical patients
that were going to chemo right
and then maybe
the cut came out of
California
might have been called something else
got to UBC
they were using it maybe for medical
for chemo patients that's how it got its name
but I was just told that
yeah it got its name from
BU
so this also
this was another centerfold it's hard to see
because of the glare
what is this right that's also
beriberi
yeah so you can't really see it maybe better
but um it was
like it was a go to strain for me for
a long time yeah
because it was just uh it was
so
I like anything
I'll say about this chat
is because it we wildly
bounce around there's like all
kinds of of things that I
think of that I want to chat about and then by
the time that I want to
write merged on to some different year
totally different people whatever
it's amazing in that
regard because we're covering so much
ground but
you said your friends with red
right yeah yeah we've
chatted with red that's awesome
and that's with the fast spear that's in
with his no shirt on
this fucking guy he showed up to the field
I'll see if I can find a picture of that can you take a picture
of that later and send it to me
so there was Matt there
was this uh we I used to go to
these harvest festivals in the early 2000s
yeah and there was this guy
Matt knows who he is there was this guy chip
um that started royal gold Matt
and he had just been out
to Switzerland I think it was
an 01 maybe or something and so
I remember the first time I saw pictures like
you were mentioning of those fields
and hectares and huge
greenhouses and all that he came back
with all these photos on his
computer of
all these people in Switzerland that it were
just starting to blow it up and at the time
it was the largest
they were doing it under
aromatherapy so we had this is
one of this is a field here one of the
fields with me oh yeah
Jesus yeah and
uh it was for
uh aromatherapy
that's kind of a that's us harvesting
some of them I remember
way back then when you were out there
somebody showed me a picture because
you weren't around and it was you
sitting in an armchair oh
and you had flour up to your knees
yeah all you seen in
the frame was like flour up to your knees
and for the
young people watching now that are like in
their in their 20s looking at
this and they're thinking yeah that's it right there
that's what we did we had terracotta
floors and
we didn't have enough place to hang it
so if you the funniest thing is on
the on the table there there's only
uh two sets of scissors
we didn't know what we
we had to harvest all the tops
so we went through the field harvested
all the tops brought them back and we're like
we can't even hang them there's not a
so we just laid them all terracotta
and we just went in and rotated them every
day and that's uh me
sitting in the chair I can I mean for
people like Matt was saying for people that are younger
I think Switzerland for
the most part was the first
time that it was like us seeing
like non land race type
pictures of
you know people actually growing on
that large of a scale
CBD grows so bad
like people used to
seeing big CBD grows here
is what I'm saying like people our age are used to seeing
these massive hemp grows and stuff but
people during that era you would never
fucking see this so it was really it was a
really unique time it was a very special
time and for that era like
people in the US seeing stuff like this was
mind-blowing at the time
yeah see this here that's
we had a company in town called
Novax and you're supposed to take your bag
into different parts of the world and
enter it in a contest right
yeah and I basically
got the most votes but they can't they because it wasn't
legal I got fucking
the boot there was a
do you know Felix
oh yeah Owl Seeds
yeah Owl yeah yeah so
this is his field
in Switzerland wow
he was
he had such shooting plans
I mean super nice
yeah
his like this is his
what his field looked like
you know do you have any of his stuff
saved
I don't think so he used to supply me
it's so impossible to get in the US
because he just never shipped here
so it's like and none of the distributors ever did
yeah
yeah oh so this is
the Sweet Tooth Garden
oh very cool that's what we
sorry for the fucking
no I've seen that picture before
I think that's a great picture yeah and
so that I don't know if we
posted that on your Instagram
like you got a bunch of pictures on
your I think that one is
there's a few of the Switzerland
that's that tilly kid
that's the skunk one on
this side oh no that's the
Black Omni and the other side is our skunk one
and did you still give me the Black Omni
yeah so that's the Black
sorry it's a dark picture yeah he has the
Black Domino yeah and yeah but before you
offload that let us know so we can make sure that
thing stays alive forever oh no I have
it I'm sending it right now to
the guy for the skunk one cut
so I'm giving him the
the
the B-98 the Widow
95 and the
B-93
I think it would be nice because it was our
Northern Lights so yeah so
this was my version
of Northern Lights and if
you look at the size that's a 4 inch cube
wow yeah and they were just
like when you see the
sizes of nugs
that's what I picture NL5 looking like
it was like it was
the best sea of green plant and it was
and it was an NL like
was it a pure NL I don't know
but it looks a lot like what I would
picture the NL5 cut looking like
yeah exactly and I thought it was just
you know
yeah it was just a phenomenal cut kind of thing
so there's another one of Red
fucking about to lose his fucking mind
that's funny dude
yeah he's fucking
that's him we would
this is in Switzerland too so we had
such a fucking good time I bet
that's when everybody loved everybody
yeah and when he
when that guy first showed up to fucking
Switzerland fucking guy
sees the field he gets all excited
goes home and he shaves
from his like shoulder
down to his wrist back of his hand
shaved his entire arm both sides
I'm like what the fuck are you doing he's like dude
I'm running through the field with my arms
out and I'm gonna make
hash
he wanted finger rub
he made it like fucking 10 feet
20 feet lost his breath
couldn't get a fucking quarter
of a fucking gram off
of him but his arm was shaved
and he was done I was like you gotta be
it was a good thought
good effort he literally did
shave his fucking arms
but I don't think he got a single
fucking gram of hash kind of thing
so we made it about 2 hours in
right now I know there's so much
more we can cover
but we could do a part 2
I was hoping actually that we could have
you back and we could see if we could get
Kip back
or maybe even
Chris Clay also as an option
because I know that we could
like I said like I mentioned before
there was about I don't even know how
many questions or how many follow ups
I could think of while you were talking about stuff
but then we just tangented off
onto something totally different
which is amazing no you don't have to apologize
I have ADHD too so it's okay
if you read my book
like I can
I can send you a copy if you need
I need a signed copy
I need a stream of consciousness which I liked
you know yeah it was
my book is written that way because I
wrote it as if I'm having a conversation
and I had to hire somebody
to
listen to me take notes
and then try to put it
in fucking order
the way I talk it's not in perfect
order and I'm looking at it going
because I smoked a lot of pot back then
and I remember it happening
this way and then another story
that crosses with it
doesn't line up perfectly and I'm just like
fuck I don't know but I did make a huge
mistake in my book
and it wasn't my mistake it was
a misprint where it says that
I grew
a cannabis cup winning
strain which I did it was a fast
year it was my fucking
not my strain but
I grew it I'm
I was the one that chose to enter it
in the cup those guys didn't want
anything to do with it
I knew it was going to win because
it was
honor of the goddess which was
all the female judges
I got
hired by Sativa sisters, Karen
she flew me to Amsterdam
just to be a fucking gigolo
guy slut because
I fucking have a
good time and I like fucking females
and I'm flamboyant and I got
laid a lot
it's why
that's why we relate so well
we're now speaking Sean's
language he's just smiling
well fucking
it's because of that
all the growers out there now know that
you can get laid and be a grower
it is possible
you don't understand how much I used to get laid
is it going to cut off in two hours
I don't know
I don't think so
he brought this beautiful hot fucking yoga
girl from Texas to work his booth
and he was all stoked
he was going to get some
I took her home
I took her back to my hotel and then I was like
I don't want to leave yet I was like I got no
place to stay I never made
my return flights so she's like
oh you can just stay with me I was like what are you saying
she's like oh one of Tony's places
and I was like you think this guy
who flew you there paid for all
your shit is going to be okay
with me coming to fuck you
Tony's place
Tony's a rock star
Tony's a fucking
well I'm the coolest
cutest fucking Sebastian Bach
wannabe
he had long hair
beautiful mane
and here comes this fucking
New York dread
and I had fucking you saw the pictures
my dreads were not fucking anything
to write home about at that point
I was sleeping in a field for the last
two months I was like I was eating off
of a dirt floor
you know and I was fucking the hottest chicks
kind of thing just a simple farm hand
yeah
so but
yeah so yeah sorry about that like I do
when I do talk
I got ADHD
oh no I wasn't
criticizing I was just simply saying
that like as you
talked about a bunch of different stuff there's like
different things I wanted to go off on
I wanted something totally else interesting
and so
wait wait wait wait wait a second
yeah you gotta take
notes as we're talking
yeah no it's good
this is what I want to talk about because I'm the same way
I'm just like I want to talk about that it's fucking awesome
