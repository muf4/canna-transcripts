Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate, where we explore the history of a clan-destined scene
through the eyes of the folks who lived it.
I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host NotSoDog, breeder and grower from Mendocino.
Welcome to the underground.
It's interesting, and like the hash thing, you know, the hash thing is kind of cool because
we can widen it out a little bit in the sense of, you know, and talk about like some traditional
weed cultures.
Because there is a real divide in weed cultures between cultures that grew weed primarily
to make hashish and cultures that grew weed primarily to smoke weed, you know?
And you know, that aspect and those choices made a lot of differences for people.
And now for a long time, America, one of the benefits of America is that we're isolated
from everywhere.
We have like big oceans on either side and all that, but we're very far away from the
hash culture.
Yeah.
Right?
So traditionally, all the best hash sort of stays local.
And then some small amount of it would go to Europe.
Right?
Yeah.
And what America typically got was the B and C grade.
Yeah.
You know, so a lot of times, Americans, especially, Canadians are a little different.
Canadians had some better connections and some better smuggling that happened up there.
Yeah.
So they sometimes saw a little bit better of a grade.
But Americans, especially, you know, we got the shaft as far as high grade.
So a lot of people think of, imagine if your view of kind bud was like beasters.
Yeah.
And that's what you thought it was, because that's the only thing you've experienced.
A lot of people, if you haven't been to Europe and you haven't been tied into those communities,
right?
Yeah.
You probably haven't smoked the best of the best.
And so there's a lot of hash people in America that think like the last 10 or 14 years of
sort of like the hash revolution that's happened over a year, that they have the best hash
by far, that they blow away all the traditional cultures by far, and that they're kind of
on the cutting edge and they've changed the game.
And they figured it out.
Nobody else did.
Yeah.
Right.
Which is pretty far from the case.
Yeah.
You know, so it's like a lot of those things where, you know, we can kind of riff on that
for a little bit.
So maybe you can kind of talk, we can start like, maybe we'll start from the beginning
where it's like, the hash culture sort of comes from the, I would say, the Near East
and the Middle East.
Yeah.
I would say Indian culture, India, Chinese, maybe.
Yeah.
I mean, and probably the oldest way to smoke cannabis before they even figured out how
to smoke flour besides like burning flowers on brassieres or something is the hand rub.
Yeah.
You know?
And that India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, the Middle East, you can go into like Lebanon
and Israel and those areas and you can go through North Africa all the way to Morocco.
And that's sort of hash culture.
Yeah.
Right.
In terms of like people grew weed to make, to turn weed into hash.
Yeah.
Where you start getting into like Southeast Asia and, you know, and especially the New
World like Mexico and Colombia and Panama and these type of places in Africa, they mostly
smoke weed.
Yeah.
You know, one that caught me off guard was Nepal.
I always think of like Nepalese temple balls and that kind of hash culture.
But if I remember correctly, when I was studying it, most of it was a flower culture.
It was a little bit of both.
Yeah.
You know, but, you know, and so to be perfectly honest, like when I started going to Amsterdam,
I went there in search of seeds.
Yeah.
You know, and then I started getting introduced to hash and, you know, I smoked a bunch of
stuff, but in the coffee shops, it's a lot like, you know, it's a lot like dispensaries
or whatever.
There's a wide variety.
Yeah.
Of mids and junk and really good and pretty decent and stuff.
And it wasn't until I met collectors that started explaining to me like how it all worked.
Yeah.
Right.
And so there's an aspect maybe I could talk for a minute about before we talk about the
regional differences for a second.
Maybe I could talk about like something that we chat about often, which is the vast difference
between how traditional hash is made and how American hash is made.
Yeah.
Right.
So the American hash, the way it's made in most cases is it's, you know, a lot of times
it's called single source, right?
It's a single clone, right?
Grown in either depths or outdoor, indoor, whatever.
And that single clone is usually, you know, dried or fresh frozen.
And then it's, you know, it's processed.
And then it's usually refrigerated or frozen right away or stored well until use.
And it's used pretty quickly.
Yeah.
Right.
Where in traditional hash culture, you're harvesting a field of seeds.
Yeah.
Right.
And you know, in America it's like, oh, I'm going to pull down this greenhouse and it's
all for lack of a better term.
It's all GMO.
Yeah.
It's all the same cut, you know, same terpene profile, same CBD, CBN, THC, all that.
It's the same thing.
Yeah.
But if you're harvesting it from any other region, you're going to get the full range
of expression of that line.
Yeah.
Because they're harvesting thousands of sisters.
Yeah.
And then they're processing those sisters.
And unlike, if you're talking about like dry sift and stuff like that, they tend to
let that hash age on the plant for a number of months.
And then when it's cold and bone dry, they start a sifting process.
Yeah.
Right.
And then from that sifting process, you know, then they make it into various grades and
then they press it.
Right.
So that's not done in America at all.
All of your terp shit, all of your, whether it's fresh frozen or it's, you know, BHO or
it's, you know, whatever extraction you're doing, it's usually single source.
Yeah.
And it's not aged.
Usually the plant is taken down fresh and as soon as they can make the hash, they make
the hash.
Yeah.
Right.
And so, you know, I'm not exactly the expert on the science or whatever, but definitely
aging it creates, you know, it transfers things from one to the other.
Right.
Yeah.
Certain amounts of CBN or CBD or this or that or whatever is converted into other bioactives,
whatnot.
And then on top of that, when we've wanted to get our buddy Bodhi on here for a long
time to do like a hippie hashish trail kind of episode.
And so we might get more in depth with that.
But when essentially when Europeans and white people first started going to the hash regions
and looking for export, most hash, there was a lot of hash that was one, two, three years
old.
Yeah.
You know, a lot of the best hashish wasn't smoked until it was over a year or two years
old.
Yikes.
Right.
I guess it's just different climate though.
You know, it was different climate.
It was stored.
It was stored very differently, you know, and they just thought that it was, it was
not like it wasn't ready yet.
Yeah.
You know.
So, and what's interesting about this is that if you go to Amsterdam and you have all these
people that have all the same access to all the same tech that we do here.
Yeah.
As far as extracting modern cultivars for hashish and all the hash heads over there
will tell you that the best hash that they smoke is the top import.
They can use pollinators.
They can use tumblers.
They can fresh froze and freeze dry and microplane and do all the tricks that people win awards
with over here.
Yeah.
And they still think that hash is inferior in quality and effect to the best of the best
import.
Right.
And, you know, but in America we all think that our shit is the best shit ever.
Of course.
That is basically as soon as we invented the nail and we invented some modern ways of hash
in 2009, you know, 2010, 2011.
Yeah.
That that was the revolution and hash went from shitty to amazing.
Yeah.
Right.
Now it's true that most Americans got shitty hash and it's also true that when all these
white people and all these Europeans and all these Americans and brotherhood of eternal
love and all these assholes started coming to these regions to look for hash and started
offering crazy amounts of money.
Yeah.
The quality went way down.
People started adulterating it.
People started, middlemen started making it worse.
People wanted volume because there was so much demand.
Right.
So a lot of times the best stuff never leaves.
Yeah.
Even like even my friends in Amsterdam who are very tied in, them getting the best of
the best is really hard.
I would imagine so.
And they and they savor it.
Right.
Yeah.
And they savor it and they hold on to it and it never makes the, you know, I almost said
clubs it never, it almost never makes the, the coffee shops.
Yeah.
Because it's all traded amongst each other.
Yeah.
Right.
It's all bought and sold that kind of grade.
You kind of have to know someone.
Yeah.
It's no different than like if you, if for mention them again, if Bodhi gave out some
like 14 week amazing sativa, you probably wouldn't be able to buy it from the cookie
store.
Yeah.
You'd have to have a home.
You'd have to have a homie.
Well, well, maybe now.
Maybe.
But, but even someone, even something that takes that long.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For sure.
You know what I mean?
Like in Europe, you know, there's, there's still like, I have a buddy over there right
now that was texting me on what to get.
Matt, I didn't tell you this, but he just bought some CG 13 and some C5 and some, and
some A5 from over there, you know?
And those, you know, those are 15, 16 week strains.
Yeah.
And that's, that's unheard of to get in a, in a, in a dispensary over here.
Yeah.
That's wild.
But over there it's their bread and butter.
Yeah.
You know, so you can find that stuff.
So the biggest, just to reiterate before we get too off track, the biggest differences
between American hash and like the best traditional is you know, the, what I was told by the Amsterdam
crews is like the best stuff is made in traditional regions, but Westerners help them to make
sure that the purity and the process is amazing.
Okay.
Does that make sense?
So making their technique more purifying.
Making sure that the cleanliness, you know, and the technique and all that is.
Good strains and everything like that.
And you know, people, one of the reasons why people ask this is people asked about temple
balls, right?
Yeah.
These Nepalese temple balls.
And I will say that these Nepalese temple balls that I smoked from my buddy was some
of the best hash I've ever smoked in my life.
Okay.
And it's interesting because a lot of people over there feel that way.
Yeah.
Right.
And they feel that like, there's something to the fact that like a lot of this stuff
is being grown at six or seven or 8,000 feet.
Yeah.
Right.
Where the air is thinner and there's more UV.
And maybe that leads to a different type of psychoactive or a different type of THC production.
Oh, sure.
You know?
And so they would say that like, you know, our buddy, yo, Sammy, you know, would say,
I don't care what modern cultivar you have.
I don't care what amazing cut you think you have or how pure you make it.
You know, it shits the bed next to the best temple ball.
Yeah.
Like if you can get the best of the best, he's like just in flavor and effect.
Yeah.
Right.
And effect is hard to say because it's invisible.
Right.
So we got used to making all these modern cultivars and thinking that like thousands
of years of hash culture, we just beat.
Yeah.
Because we're a little cleaner.
Yeah.
Because we got a little bit better and we have a little bit, we have some machinery
and we're a little bit better process.
But like old timers will tell you that like, they think that putting your hash in the,
in the, in the fridge ruins it.
Yeah.
And you know what, what, what's weird about the Nepalese stuff is I will say that, and
this isn't a plug on it or whatever, but anything I've ever smelled that smelled like the Mendo
perps that I cracked.
Yeah.
Had the Mendo perps in it.
Yeah.
In the sense that like, I've never smelled that terpene profile from any other plant
that wasn't it.
Yeah.
Unless it was related to it in the sense that like someone bred with it or it was, it was
an ancestor of that.
Right.
Yeah.
Except these temple balls that I smoked and they smell when you were burning them, they
smelled like you were burning Mendo perps.
It's interesting.
Now, you know, does that mean that like the Mendo pea is Nepalese?
I don't know.
You know, but, or does it mean that it just evoked that terpene profile?
Yeah.
You know, I can't say.
But all those guys over there, what's crazy is that all those hash heads over there, they
grow all kinds of phenomenal weed and they sell all that weed to buy the best hash they
can get.
Yeah.
You know, and like somebody like, somebody like, you know, when you were interviewing
a Camara and Red, you know, I mean, he was saying that like, you know, he's never even
seen Sam Skunkman smoke weed.
Yeah.
That, you know, the top people over there are Hashishans.
Yeah.
You know, they smoke hash.
They're resin farmers.
Makes sense.
You know, that's what they're after.
They're after a resin.
Right.
And so, you know, we could widen that out for a little bit and talk about how, you know,
this is like a totally different tangent or whatever.
But when Americans started smoking weed, we were, we're a flower culture.
We were getting weed from Mexico and Panama and Jamaica and Columbia and all these things.
And we were getting bricked and we were getting, you know, we were getting bricked of this
stuff and we started blending them with Afghans because of prohibition.
Right.
And it's super common and Matt can speak on this too.
But most of the weed smokers back then were very disappointed in the smoke of the Afghans.
Yeah.
They didn't really like the high and they didn't really like the way it burned.
Yeah.
It was so vastly different than what they were used to.
Compared to sativas because those sativas have been bred for smoking.
Yeah.
They were bred for, they were bred to be burned as flour.
Yeah.
You know, where, I mean, I told this before, but there's this funny story of when Sam Scuntman
was in Afghanistan and he was searching for seeds.
Right.
And so he was asking these warlords for seeds, for flour, you know, and they looked at him
and they said, you know, smoking flowers for women and slaves.
Right.
Are you a woman or a slave?
Yeah.
And he had to convince them that he was a man and he just wanted them so he could grow
his own flour at home and make resin.
I wonder if he pulled out his wiener.
You know, and they prove it, you know.
But to them, it was like that, that was, that was the thing.
The flour was a waste product.
Yeah.
You know, peasants and women, slaves and women smoked, smoked flour.
Real men smoked hash.
That was their culture.
So obviously you don't care how flour burns and you don't care how the flour affects you
because you never smoke it in that culture.
Yeah.
So Americans were the first people taking all these hash plants and, and, and Afghans
and actually wanting to smoke them.
Yeah.
It hadn't happened before because none of those people back, back home where they were
from gave a shit.
Yeah.
And you can kind of draw a line from Morocco on the, the Western part of Africa, all throughout
North Africa, all the way up through Lebanon and Israel, all the way over Iran and into
Afghanistan and that's all hash.
Yeah.
Right.
But then once you get to like Cambodia, Thailand, that all kind of got lost.
Yeah.
And it flipped into weed smoking and exporting actual weed, you know?
I wonder why.
Huh?
I wonder why.
I don't know.
Why that one became so separate, you know?
I don't know.
You know?
You know, and you know, it's like, I prefer flour too, to be honest.
And I don't think that we need to like base what, what, what we think of on what Afghans
think.
But, you know, definitely they, you know, they just thought that because that was the
culture that they were raised.
Men smoke hash.
Yeah.
You know, and women smoke flour and slaves.
I like that women, women actually.
They weren't good enough for hash.
Women were puffing tough on the flour over there.
And you know, and so there's this thing where when I first went over to Amsterdam, I met
this guy, he's still over there, Steve the Nose or whatever.
And I got introduced to some of this hashish culture.
And they would show me the best Moroccan, the best Lebanese.
These are amazing temple balls.
This is from Afghanistan.
This is from the Pakistani highlands.
And you smoke all this stuff.
And it's unbelievable.
Yeah.
Like he had the best hash collection I've ever seen in my life.
And these guys, they didn't even really smoke weed very much.
They had it.
Yeah.
You know, but they mostly cared about hashish.
That's so funny.
You know, and they thought they didn't care what method you used.
They didn't care what extraction technique you had.
All those cuts that you could make hash off of, they were inferior.
Yeah.
They were, it was inferior hashish.
Interesting.
You know?
Yeah.
And, you know, and so we, we, huh?
I didn't know you were there.
I'm here.
So, you know, they, so it's really a big, it's really interesting because Americans,
like until things open up, I would say that 99% of Americans have probably never smoked
the top import grade of hash that you can get.
Yeah.
They just haven't seen it.
Yeah.
It doesn't, it doesn't show up.
It gets, it barely gets to Europe.
Yeah.
Before it gets absorbed.
I see a lot of people asking about the, the opium thing.
And I can comment on that real quick.
What they're referring to is an old story and it wasn't hash.
It wasn't a weed thing.
It was necessarily, it wasn't necessarily a weed thing.
The story was that Thai sticks were dipped in something called Passa water, which was
the water used when you produce heroin.
So when you're, when you're doing the conversion from opium to heroin, the leftover water is
called Passa water.
So there was theories and, or people would spread stories that, you know, all Thai sticks
were dipped in Passa water and that's why they were so strong.
When in reality, it probably wasn't the case.
That's not really how, how the, the water works drying on to, to weed, you know, but
it, that, that is stuck forever.
So that a lot of people think that Thai sticks have heroin in them and that's, yeah, that's
where that came from.
And you know, they don't mostly because, yeah, I think if it happened, it would have been
very rare.
I mean, the re, the reason why is because cartels like that, they don't put more expensive
drugs on cheaper ones.
Yeah, for free.
That's not how, that's not how they operate, you know?
I mean, you know, now with like the whole fentanyl thing and all that, people are cutting
all kinds of stuff with highly dangerous substances.
Back in the day, if anything got cut with anything, it was by something cheaper and
weaker.
Yeah.
I'm very skeptical on, on street fentanyl being cut into normal things because it's
still more expensive, I would imagine, than most of the drugs are saying that it's cut
with.
It doesn't really make sense unless people are trying to buy fentanyl and they're cutting
it with shit, but cheaper.
I'm going to, I'm going to reiterate it one more time just because I think it's really
important is that almost all traditional hash, regardless of grade or quality, is made out
of thousands and thousands and thousands of sister plants grown from seed.
And so you get a very wide range of that, that strains profile, THC, CBD, CBN, terpenes,
all that kind of stuff.
It all gets blended together, right?
And so it's vastly different than growing a room or growing a greenhouse of GMO or Skittles
or something along those lines and taking the exact same genetic cut.
Right?
Yep.
And that exact same genetic cut and, and, and extracting that.
Indeed.
Right?
It's just very different.
And the way they process it is different.
And how long that it takes them before they think it's cured into something that they
want to smoke is also different.
So American hash culture is very new and it goes against the grain as far as like any
other kinds of hashish culture that you would, that you would, you would see.
Now it is true of course that with, with demand, right?
They're going to mix all kinds of brokers and, and, and people looking for profit are
going to mix all kinds of, of cut into hash.
Yeah.
I'm talking about the nicest stuff.
I'm talking about the pure grade.
Yeah.
Right.
And hash in these regions was a lot better before all these white people showed up demanding
tons.
Oh, I'm sure.
And then once all these Europeans and all these English and all these Americans started
showing up on the hippie hashish trail in the seventies and they wanted just enormous
amounts of it, they blew through all the best.
And then of course, just like any other humans, you're going to get a bunch of people that
are trying to meet demand.
Yeah.
So the quality on average is going to go way down and you're going to get a bunch of B
and C grade and then you're going to get, you know, and then you're going to get, you
know, the, the top end is going to be a lot more rare.
Yeah.
You know?
And you know, like I said, all those old timers that smoke hash, they all swear that the best
traditional hash is still the best.
Yeah.
Now, whether that's because of the strains they use, whether that's because they dry
farm it, you know, I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of different reasons.
But the process itself is very different.
Yeah.
And the effect is very different.
And they, they all, they all swear by it.
And that's what they take the best of what they grow.
You know, and that, and people say that too.
People say, I see that all the time.
I have a buddy of mine that was like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
They know what they're fucking talking about.
They fucking make hash with the same hand they fucking wipe their shit on.
Yeah.
Right.
And they say like, these people, these humans that have spent thousands of years refining
their hash culture don't know shit.
Yeah.
From what we've learned since 08 on.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And different cultures, man.
And Americans, we've gone, we've gone through everybody dabbed with a fucking thousand degree
glowing cherry red hot nail or banger.
Yeah.
You know, unpurged BHO.
Every two or three years, we're like improving our technique and you only have to go back
five or six or seven years to techniques and shit that people wouldn't do again.
Yeah.
That already get out of style that we learned that a bunch of these terpenes are like carcinogenic.
Yeah.
At the heat that most of these people were dabbing them.
Yeah.
With.
Right.
And then the other thing too, is when you watch, you know, you can get on IG, right?
You can watch some of these hash cultures work and how they keep the hash and how they
work the hash, you know, and how they get the hash malleable and how they get the resin
to be warm before they use it.
You know, all that different types of stuff.
And like, and so there's a lot to learn from those people.
Yeah.
You know, because they've been smoking hash for a long time.
Yeah.
You know, and like we, you know, we stumble upon all this stuff and we think we're doing
amazing.
But as you can see through, you know, we want to put it on a piece of parchment paper and
be able to see through it.
Yeah.
We want to make it off fresh frozen, harvested, fresh frozen, put into this thing, put through
a freezer dryer, all this different stuff.
And you know you know, Frenchie people talking about Frenchie and stuff like that.
And he did bring a little bit of the of of of that different culture into all this, you
know.
And there's an aspect of, you know, the the old timers will tell you that you would store
the hash in like in loose bags, right?
In a cold spot.
And they said, if you wanted to ruin your hash, you put it in the fridge.
Yeah.
And and the fridge and the humidity and the bullshit would ruin your fucking hash.
They were like, if you wanted to ruin it, just just do that to it.
If you put it into a cold, dry cellar and you let it age for a while, boom, it would
get better.
Yeah.
You know, and, you know, and so and they also grow with a bunch of different cultivars that
we're not used to.
Yeah, that's very true, too.
You know, and, you know, and they, you know, they grow from seed every year.
Yeah.
Right.
And we don't.
We grow from clone.
You know?
And so we've gotten really, especially on the West Coast, you know, we've gotten really
egotistical about our hash making.
Yeah.
And about our extracts.
And we are, you know, we are doing better.
I'm not I'm not saying that like what we do isn't viable.
I'm just saying that like from the people in Amsterdam that have vast experience with
both.
Yeah.
They all prefer the traditional shit if they can get the grade they want.
Oh, I'm sure.
So that's you say something.
OK, people are asking the title of the book and someone did point out that Cherniak maybe
isn't so well liked, but this is with Lawrence Cherniak and Alan Dronkers.
It's called How She Used the Joy of Making and Curing.
I was just putting up some pictures to illustrate as we were talking about how she's the different
styles, looks, techniques in here.
But yeah, people used to sit there and I don't know if you can see my hand or whatever, but
like you can see they would sit there and rub and rub and work and work and work and
really get the hash warm and malleable.
Sometimes people would put it into a plastic bag and they would put it in the heel of their
shoe and they would walk on it to like work and work and work.
And they wouldn't just sit there and you'll see videos on IG now because there's people
that are going around Afghanistan and Pakistan and some of these hash cultures of how before
they use it, they heat it up.
They work it, they get it to be a certain way.
So there's a lot of old techniques that I think are kind of being ignored.
It's almost like this shit where like in California in the 70s, people knew about red and white
wine.
That was the level of knowledge that like red went with prime rib and meat, and white
was for their wife and went with fish or chicken or something.
And that's about all they knew.
And now you fast forward 30 years or 40 years or whatever, and now it's like they're like,
oh, Merlot and this Appalachian and the Pinot Gris that's all going on and whatnot.
And I think the same thing is going to happen with hash.
We're a baby hash culture in America, and we don't know shit.
And we're learning stuff.
And every few years you can see hash culture and you can see people's techniques improve.
But we could learn a lot from, and maybe they'll get to a point like with the legality of things
or whatnot where you could grow a field.
Like it would be cool for seed makers, right?
Where you could grow a field of seeds.
And then harvest the whole thing for hash.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.
And then you get the full range of whatever, you know, Matt's bubble berry or a Skittles
hybrid or a GMO hybrid or whatever the case may be.
You'd get the full range in the hash instead of just like this one cut.
I'm going to concentrate what's in this one cut.
Because that's never been done before, right?
Yeah.
It's not typically how it's done over there.
It's not typically how it's done over there.
And so we have our own thing and it's not bad or anything like that.
I'm not saying that, but it's very different.
It's very different.
Now we could expand it out a little bit and talk about when they first started bringing
Afghans, you know, we all started growing sativa in America, right?
Because sativa seeds came free with the fucking wheat.
You get kilos of, you know, head stash brought in and everyone's selling it.
Your weed came with free seeds.
We used to sit there in high school leaning back against the chair and we'd have a tray
and you'd break up the weed up here and you'd let all the seeds and stems roll down and
you'd keep your weed up there, right?
But hash didn't come with free seeds.
Yeah.
I was just watching someone tell a joke about bubble man.
So we didn't get very many seeds.
So sativas were everywhere in the 70s and 80s.
And that was primarily what it all was.
How do you think puck washes?
How do I think?
Man, you know, if there's people out there that don't like me and you want to think of
me as a shitty grower, I should show you some pictures of my puck grows.
Because I did some depths and I did some greenhouse outdoors with it.
And boy, was it not impressive.
I wouldn't wash it because there would be no resin to wash off.
It was a really ugly.
I mean, I can't say what it looked like in the 80s or in the 90s when it was a little
younger.
But you know, when I got it, it hated sunlight and food.
Strangely enough, those were two things that I like to give my plants sunlight and food
at the time.
So yeah, it was really unusual.
So there's bubble hash.
And there's another aspect of it too, where it's like, maybe we could talk about this
for a second is that most people, most Americans, I was gonna say white people, but most Americans
will say it that way, right?
Like our time is money.
So you look at the way traditional people sift, sifting is an amazing product, but it's
the most time consuming and it gets the least yield.
So it's the rarest.
So Americans are constantly looking for, can I wash this?
Can I BHO it?
Can I CO2?
What way can I do it that's efficient and I can get an extraction that yields?
How can I get yield?
Well, most of the time you have to put that through a solvent.
It's not just knocking the flowers over a screen and getting dry sift and then putting
that dry sift through a series of screens and cleaning it up like bubble man is shown.
Even water is a salt, water is the original solvent.
That's why it's so funny that people call water solventless.
Water hash is solventless.
Like look, put in is water a solvent into Google and see what comes up.
It's a solvent.
It's the original.
And what's crazy about that is if you read, now granted there's some THC and terpenes
and stuff like that aren't soluble in water.
But there is, if you read like a Rob Clark's book, Hasheesh, about 25% of terpenes are
water soluble.
Yeah.
So you can, so there's times when we did stuff with water hash, right?
Where you run something like some kind of tangy cross and that citrus comes through
super strong, right?
But then you run something like the 56 day headband and it comes out smelling like axle
grease.
Yeah.
It's super potent, but it's like chemical process didn't, like it's the chain that
makes up the aroma and the taste didn't make it through the hash making process.
Right?
So most of the stuff we do today, whether it's BHO or whether it's water hash and
then frozen or this or that, a lot of these things affect the flavor.
And a lot of what becomes popular is what keeps its flavor with the time saving techniques
that we use to make hash extraction easier.
Yeah.
You know, I mean, you watch, you watch these guys like on IG or whatever, then you see
them do their traditional hash thing.
No American wants to be sitting there with a face mask on for eight hours a day over
a thing, shaking flour and knocking off the crystals and then carefully, you know, like
refining it.
It doesn't get you enough weight for your time.
Yeah.
People, we want to use machines.
Well that changes it too.
Yeah.
Right?
It has to.
And part of the reason why I think like the tangy and the whole, to mention that again,
the tangy and the whole citrus craze happened is because when, like, you know, in mid 2000s,
you couldn't give away Calio.
No, no.
People would not.
If you had citrus weed, that was a great way for your broker to look at you and say, nah
dog.
Yeah.
Nah dog.
I don't need the headache weed.
I'm not taking your weed, you know?
But then, and it was also citrus weed tends to not be that potent.
Yeah.
So it's, it's, you know, you could call it, I don't want to say midsy, but you could say
moderately potent at best.
Yeah.
With a flavor people didn't like.
Lacking recreational potency.
Yeah.
But then you start extracting it with BHO or this or that or whatever.
And all of a sudden that, that citrus terpene came through super solid and now the shit's
70% THC.
Yeah.
And it actually gets you high.
Yeah.
And so a lot of the popular strains in America that got made into hash, got made into hash
because after you put them through the processes that we do to make life easy.
Yeah.
Still tasted and worked good.
You know, but the, but the old, like the old static tech and the old, like, and the old
sifting tech that was like used forever.
That wasn't abandoned because it sucked.
It was abandoned because it was lower yield and took a lot more time.
Yeah.
And Amer, and you know, most hash guys like to make their money quick.
Right?
Yeah.
Turn it over.
I'm going to turn it over, you know?
And so you get like what you think is the world's most amazing hash.
The hash collectors in Europe don't think you're smoking the world's most amazing hash.
Yeah.
And that's not that it's not good and everybody can have their opinion, you know?
Yeah.
I mean, I think people have a different perspective on it and more, man, it's hard to say, but
more cultured at some points when it comes to hash specifically.
I mean, it's one of those things like, like, that's why you can compare it to wine.
Yeah.
You know, it's like now in California, you can have all these wine nerds that are extremely
intelligent about the different grapes and the different grades and the different appellations
and where certain varieties do better than others because of climate.
Yeah.
But in the 70s, it was red and white.
And that's kind of where we are hashish wise right now.
We're just learning and like anybody who's listening right now, like, you know, who's
made hash for the last 10 or 15 years, think about how much your techniques and what you've
been doing has been changing every year or two this whole time.
It's not like you've reached the mountaintop, you know, it's like people figure out a way
to do it better and then people are like, oh shit, I'm going to do it that way.
Yeah.
And a lot of the traditional hash people tell me that most of the modern cultivars that
we grow with suck as far as hash extraction.
Where you get some, yeah, where you get some Lebanese shit or you get some Nepalese stuff
that for generations has been grown just for that.
And that shit dumps.
Yeah.
You know, because that's what they designed it to do.
And when, when the hash revolution hit 10, 12 years ago, you know, people started looking
around for all the elites that had been kept around and do any of these also dump hash.
Yeah.
They weren't bred for that.
No one ever thought of it.
Hash was like a, you know, hash was like a personal product.
Yeah.
Maybe you could get some keef at a club.
Maybe you should get some water hash at a club.
You know, people would get scissor hash, you know, if you were working or people would
get finger hash when they were bucking down stuff and all that, but it wasn't like commoditized.
Right.
Did you ever use an ISO 2?
Oh God.
Yeah.
I want, I want one of those to try out.
If any of you guys out there have an ISO 2, I will trade you some seeds for one.
I used to use my dad's as like a He-Man castle along with my band group, Castle Grayskull
and shit.
But I'd really like to see how it works today.
You know what I mean?
We could probably do a, we could probably do a whole show one time on just the different
eras of like, Oh, that sounds cool.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm going to go on an octagon.
Oh, I'm going to grow areoponics.
Oh, I'm going to grow NFT.
Oh, I'm going to grow this way.
Oh, I'm going to extract that way.
Oh, I'm going to, you know, Coliseums.
Yeah.
Coliseums.
I mean, dude, I had a, I had two Coliseum.
I mean, we could go through all that of just all like whatever's the most cutting edge
shit imaginable.
Yeah.
Do you remember the V tables that were like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember when those popped up.
Those are pretty cool.
I mean, I don't know because a lot of my friends are egotistical or whatever, you know, but
it's like the, the main, you talk to hash people in California and the West coast now,
and they think they're the best hash people that have ever lived.
Sure.
That they dominate, you know, and I'm not dissing them because they are figuring stuff
out and they are making nice hash.
Yeah.
Right.
Most of them are failed growers.
Fuck them.
They're also turning their back on thousands of years of humans learning shit.
Yeah.
You know, and, and it's, it's like, it's like when you're shocked when old people have something
to teach you.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
You know, there's, there's, there's techniques and there's things and there's aspects, you
know, that, you know, I mean, think about all those classes that Frenchy did.
Yeah.
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
You know, and he was, and he, all he was doing was just teaching some people how different
cultures over there made some hash.
Yeah.
You know, and people ate it up.
Yeah, they did.
You know, and there's different flavor profiles and there might be a way where you take a
cultivar and you extract it one way and it's potent, but it sucks.
And then you do it another way and it's amazing.
So it's not like all strains react the same.
Like some, like I said, some things go through water like a champ.
Right.
I even did shit where I would have like a greenhouse full of the same strains and then
I would have outdoor.
Yeah.
And like sometimes like the sour diesels and certain things like that, if they got rained
on a bunch in October, their terpene profile wouldn't be exactly what I was after.
Yeah.
But the sour diesel grown 30 feet away in a greenhouse that never got rained on once
was fed with the same food and the same everything would be bomb.
You know, but like the super silver haze or certain citrus stuff, it wasn't affected by
the rain at all.
Yeah.
It just kept its profile.
But sometimes the rain, enough rain would fuck up the flavor on my weed.
Yeah.
You know?
And well, you know, someone just said it's potent, but it sucks.
That's the biggest oxymoron ever.
Not really.
It depends because it depends on how, it depends on how you, what the high is like.
Right?
I mean, you can read old high times, right?
And not to bring up high times, but a lot of people's opinion of the old Afghani one
was that it was a uncomfortable, anxiety inducing body high that gave you heart palpitations.
And it was one of the least enjoyable smokes out there.
Yeah.
And they preferred sativas or normal or NLs or there was lots of other highs that they
liked.
Yeah.
They thought it was potent, but they didn't like it.
Yeah.
You know, some people like some, some people, the, that sativa buzz, that NL five haze buzz
or that Neville's haze buzz, it's super potent and it makes them want to crawl out of their
skin and jump off a bridge and die.
And they'd never smoke it again if, if you know, they hate it.
That's like me with skunk one types.
They fucking hate it.
It's super potent.
It's amazing.
It's the nicest sativa I've ever smoked, but there's people that are smoking a couple of
times and they'll be like, I know that's a bad time for me.
So you know, potency is just one aspect.
It just means it's strong.
It doesn't mean that it's going to affect you in a pleasant way.
Yeah.
You know, I personally, I don't like edibles.
Yeah.
Oh no, you can't control the high.
You're just strapped in because, and the reason why I don't like edibles, I'll be perfectly
honest is that they fuck with my equilibrium.
Oh really?
They give me the, like, you know, when you're drunk and you're like, if I put a foot on
the ground, I'll stop the spins.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They can give me the spins.
Ooh, that's not fun.
And I don't like that feeling.
Yeah.
And I have friends that'll be like, oh, you just got to eat enough and blow past it.
Yeah.
And for me, I'm like, well, how, how many hours of uncomfortable do I have to feel before
I start feeling good?
Yeah.
Cause I don't feel good.
Yeah.
I like weed a whole bunch and I don't feel good at all.
You know?
So how many hours of my life do I want to not feel good?
Yeah.
You know, that happens to me enough, you know, so I don't do edibles because like I got kids
and shit, you know, so you know, one of my kids could break their toe or whatever and
I, it doesn't matter how much weed I've smoked.
I can hop in the car, I can take them to the hospital.
I can do whatever I need to do.
Yeah.
But if I just ate a couple hundred milligrams of edibles, I might need to like call a lifeline,
you know, or I'm not, you know, and then, yeah, I have all kinds of people are going
to start commenting, oh, you just need to take these, you just need to eat these.
I'm just saying that for me, the way my body works, sometimes it gives me the spins.
Yeah.
And I don't like the spins.
I think a lot of people don't understand that though.
How variable the, everybody's brain chemistry is and how each individual cannabinoid or
what have you interacts differently with everyone.
Not everybody gets the same effect from the same clone though, though, you know, I mean,
collectives, that's the way people are tied.
All Indicas do this, all Sativas do this, all hybrids do right in the middle, you know,
it's just, yeah, it's just, it's just not that way.
I mean, I, I, chem 91 is one of my all time favorite highs.
Yeah.
It makes me feel like I'm a teenager watching a Mel Brooks movie and I got a big thing of
popcorn and I'm happy and content and life is great.
Yeah.
And then you have good friends that are like, man, I mean, I love what it, I love what it,
what it breeds like and I understand that a lot of other people like it, but I wouldn't
like to smoke it on a regular basis.
Yeah.
But I love it, you know?
So there's that aspect too, you know, and that's, that's one of the main things that
all the hash guys that experienced tell me is that they can't, they just simply can't
find the same effect.
Yeah.
How have you tried suppositories buddy?
Have you tried any of those?
No.
I can assist you if you need help.
I know you've got, you've got all those, you got to all those extra jumbo.
I got that extra long attachment on the thing to get it way up there.
Extra long release.
No, I don't, I don't, I don't need any of that kind of stuff.
I mean, I'm sure that for people that have a hard time and a bunch of nausea, you know,
I'm not trying to make fun of it or whatever, that might be the best way for them to absorb.
Yeah.
I got a pretty funny, pretty funny story about boofing stuff.
So I had a friend named Brian, he's dead now, but he had heard that if you boof Oxycontin
and granted that we were like 17, 18, you heard that if you boof Oxycontin, you get
really fucked up.
And this is in the early days of Oxycontin.
So he stuck the Oxycontin up his ass and waited and waited.
And then he realized that there's a coating on the outside that it really won't penetrate
through your asshole.
So he had to crush it up and reinsert it into his ass.
That's my boofing story.
You're welcome, everyone.
I do joke with my friends that are younger than me, you know, that their contribution
to drug culture is boofing.
Yeah, it really is.
That's what they're going to be remembered for.
That's their innovation.
Yeah.
You know, all that different types of stuff.
And you know, whatever it like, I have seen people making suppositories for very sick
cancer patients and AIDS patients and other various aspects.
And I'm sure that they do a great job.
But what people also should know too, is that when you eat when you eat weed, or you take
it, you know, suppository style, it turns into THC 11.
Okay, did you know that?
No, I didn't.
It converts into something when you smoke it.
It's Delta 11 THC.
Delta 11.
That's right.
And it's much longer lasting.
You know, and so that's kind of why you get fucked like in the sense of like, if it hits
you the wrong way.
Yeah, you're sort of stuck with that feeling for a while.
And so me and Delta 9 are real good friends.
Yeah, Delta 9 and me, we get along, we see eye to eye on things.
I can smoke whatever format even you know, I'm more of a flower person than hash, but
I can smoke a bunch of hash and I can still accomplish whatever I need to do.
Yeah, 11 hydroxy not Delta.
That makes sense.
Okay.
Yeah, 11.
Maybe I misspoke.
But, but yeah, it converts in your gut into something different.
Okay.
And it's longer lasting and it has some different effects.
Well, yeah, doesn't it bind with your fat cells too, which makes it more potent in your
stomach?
Now we're getting into into areas I'm not familiar with.
Yeah.
You know, it's one of those things where I don't care about edibles that much because
I don't, I don't, I don't use them.
They're not that important to me.
You know, I do think that they're a great way for some people to get medicine.
Yeah, you know, but I got shit to do and I got kids and I can't take myself out.
Yeah, yeah, it's a good way to take yourself out.
And you know, to be honest, like in the 90s and stuff like that, you know, now you can
go to the you can go to the store and you can be like, Oh, I'm gonna get a five milligram
or a 10 milligram or 50 or 100 milligram, you know?
And back in the day, you know, in, you know, when I was doing edibles more, it was like,
is this ganja goo ball?
Am I going to feel anything?
Yeah.
All the way up to I'm in my tent and I can't move.
And I'm missing the festival because I'm horizontal.
You know?
Yeah.
Okay.
So Kymira just answered.
He said no, it crosses the blood brain barrier more easily.
Makes sense.
Yeah, it converts in the liver, not the gut, which totally makes sense.
Yeah.
Yeah, I knew I was gonna I knew I was gonna misspeak.
I knew that it affected you differently and it converted differently.
Yeah.
I was nervous to talk about the various science of it because I wasn't I probably wasn't gonna
get there.
Yeah, see, I'm very adventuresome.
And I'll talk about the science of it.
You know, exactly nothing what I'm talking about.
So I'm good at that part.
I just knew that it converted differently.
And it lasted longer.
And it has a different series of effects than inhale and then smoking.
Yeah, I know someone said that people with diabetes can't feel edibles and I can absolutely
disprove that.
Because I'm diabetic and I can feel edibles.
Yeah, I mean, I've been on you know, I've eaten some ganja goo balls at times and stuff.
And I definitely I'm not talking I'm speaking from experience when I was like, I'm in the
tent and I can't move.
I can't stand up.
I need to pee.
Am I gonna pee myself?
Can I move?
Yeah, that's the good shit.
Yeah, because you know, it's just like, it's just bad dosing.
These six ganja goo balls are almost worthless and you wasted your money and this one is
like catatonic.
Yeah.
You know, do you really want to be catatonic at a festival?
You know?
Yeah, no, that's how you get raped.
Well, no, I mean, not that.
But it's just yeah, you paid money to be there and now you're laying on rocks in a tent spinning.
But it's just one of those things where it's like, you know, and actually too, it's like
it's interesting in the sense that I don't even know if I should bring this up.
But I have a I have a daughter that's I have a couple daughters in middle school, right?
And it's one of their big issues right now.
Yeah, is edibles.
Really?
Think about it.
Right?
Taking edibles to school.
Yeah, they're easy to mask.
I don't know, an older brother, an older sister or someone that's willing to go and buy them
and kick them down.
Yeah, they're sour patch kids.
They're made in a bunch of attractive ways.
Now, like when we were kids, the only way you got edibles is if some degenerate older
brother made some brownies.
Yeah, exactly.
Some shake or something like that was able to stink up their whole house or some shit.
Yeah, now they can get like these really attractive, much more controllable packages.
Right?
There, you're not going to get caught with a lighter or a pipe or stinking like weed
or anything like that.
You can just eat like a 10 milligram.
Yeah, right.
And so they're a lot more prevalent.
Nerds, ropes, sour patch kids, rice, crispy treats, all kinds of, there's an immense amount
of baking and candy and shit and much more controllable amounts that I just don't like
it.
And I'm not what you're saying is kids are good customers.
None, you know, I just mean that kids are going to get access to whatever is cool that's
available in their local area.
And it's easy to smuggle in.
I mean, I remember back in high school, they would do like locker raids and all kinds of
shit trying to catch us dealing drugs.
And we didn't have things like, you know, gummy bears and shit like that.
If you, if you, if you took out some of those gummy bear, if you took out some sour patch
kids from a, from a, an edible thing you got and you put them in a real sour patch kids
thing and took them in your lunchbox or your thing or backpack, how would they fucking
know?
Exactly.
Yeah.
Visible at that point, you know?
But, you know, so I just, I just, I just don't like edibles, you know, I just don't like
edibles.
But we kind of got off, we kind of got off track there or whatever, but it's like a big
thing, you know, when some people are into them, but they steal, they steal my, they
steal my equilibrium.
I don't know if they steal other people's equilibrium, but I start not feeling the right
way and then I get hot.
And when you get hot and you have the spins, I mean, how fun is that?
Yeah, you end up puking.
That sucks.
It's not fun for me.
No.
You know?
But, you know, and I think it'll probably take like, it would probably take like international
freedom where weed really becomes opened up, you know?
Yeah.
For Americans over here, at least to really start trying like the finest grades of imported
hashish.
I just don't see, I see the world opening up and it being so super corporate and hyper
illegal that nobody's going to be fucking with shit like that.
You know, it's going to be in Afghanistan, they'll have those small clubs and all that
shit and it'll be just that culture infiltrating everywhere as opposed to letting the cultures
that are there stay there and being able to try each other's cultures.
Who knows?
There's money to be made off this shit.
You know, right now, you know, you can get Greek olive oil, you know, you can get those
Iberian hams that cost $1,800 for the leg that have been dry aged X amount.
You know what you can't get?
Huh?
You know what you can't get?
Thailand races anymore.
It's very, very hard.
Things are disappearing, not just the strains, but the cultures are disappearing with them
in some senses.
And granted, that's not a hash culture necessarily, but it just like, just like those strains
disappearing.
I mean, it's, you know, the techniques are going to be going with them over time.
So you know, people are saying people are talking about people paying more for six star
or whatever else.
So there's an aspect where, you know, there's obviously different grades, right?
But no matter how pure you make it, you're still limited by your starting material.
Yeah.
Are you all getting it from a single source?
Right?
Is it all the same cultivars, all the same cut?
Are you getting it from a field?
Are you getting it from a, you know, you planted thousands of seeds and you're harvesting those
females, you know?
And all that.
And so, you know, there's an aspect there where, you know, because you're going to,
hash is concentrated, right?
Where you're going to concentrate what was in the flower.
You're going to concentrate the qualities of that, of that THC or that blend or that
CBD, CBN, terpene profile, all that.
What do they call it?
Entourage effect?
Yes.
You know, so you just, you're going to get a vastly different experience probably from
Moroccan, from Lebanese to Afghanistan to Southeast Asian to Sherbolato.
Yeah.
Right?
Yes, sir.
Sherbolato.
Sherbolato.
And then a lot of times too, people, people still like even hashmakers right now, it's
like, oh my God, this is unbelievable.
The terpenes off it are amazing, but it yielded 2%.
So fuck it.
I'm not going to do it.
Right?
People want hash dumpers.
Yeah.
It's gotta, it's gotta be commercially viable first or it won't get beyond some small little
circle.
There might be some, there might be a few friends that like wash it and they're all
trading grams amongst each other and all stoked, but it won't trickle down to where the normal
person can get it because it wasn't a viable amount.
Exactly.
And I'm not a hash guy that, that big or whatever, but I do know from working in legal cannabis
and stuff like that, that there's minimum numbers of weight return that you need to
get to make it be viable.
Yeah.
To pay for your time, to pay for the equipment, to pay for the shift work and all this stuff
that goes into making hash.
So if it doesn't dump enough, regardless of how nice it affects you, it's going to get,
it's going to get shifted to the side.
And if you've got something that, that blows your head off, but it yields three and a half
percent and it's sister plant tastes a little bit different and doesn't work as good, but
yields 6%, the 6% is getting run and washed all day.
Yeah.
Because that's making a money, you know?
So you know, so there's that too, where it's like the commercial side of it.
People might think, oh, we have the best hash in the world, but unless it's commercially
viable, you'll probably never see it unless you're growing it and washing it and making
it yourself.
Or in your small circle of friends and trading it amongst each other.
Just like, you know, just like before, like if you were growing a 12 or 13 or 14 week
plant, you'd probably never be able to buy that in the store.
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.
GMO is probably the first thing that came out that took 12 weeks that people were willing
to jump on.
Yeah.
That always shocked me, especially coming from cookies.
Well part of the reason, part of the reason why I think people were willing to jump on
it was because even though it took two weeks, four weeks longer than they wanted or three
weeks longer than they wanted, it dumped like crazy.
And it tested super high.
And it smelled like Chem D and Chem D was not everywhere.
So it like, so you know, so the yield made it worth it.
Yeah.
Right.
Where if the yield doesn't make the extra time worth it.
I mean, Matt and I joke that like, I mean, there's some pretty famous breeders out there
that are like, if it takes any longer than 63 days, it's fucked.
Or I'm harvesting it early.
Yeah.
I've got this banger Colombian and it takes 11 weeks, but I don't take it longer than
63 days because it doesn't fit my model.
Yeah.
You know, and that's kind of how that rolls.
Yeah.
And American way.
The American way.
Well, it's just, it's, it's, there's a difference between quality and commercial.
Yeah.
And that's what I mean too about, about like, for instance, the, the wine industry is now
there's enough education in the wine industry that a certain seven or eight year old Cabernet
from a certain winery in a certain region, you can get that extra ducats to make that
a viable product right now.
Cannabis doesn't have enough of that separation to make the rare and the cool and the expensive
worth it.
Right.
There's all, there's like this range that everybody's working in and we haven't gotten
educated enough that you could be like, you should pay more for this weed because it's
Neville's Hayes and it takes 15 weeks and you know, it does this.
Eventually you'll have people that are willing to throw down for that.
Yeah.
Right.
Right now you don't.
Right.
Right now it's just, it's, it's, you don't, you know?
And so until you get that level of education, until you get that consumer willing to pay
for it, I honestly think like the reason why people are going to yell at me for this, but
I think the reason why fricking Hayes did so well in New York, right?
Was because there was musicians and rich people and Wall Street brokers to sell it to.
Yeah.
They could sell them a higher grade.
Yeah.
Straight up.
Just like that.
You know?
I mean, do you think Kush would have been so popular in LA if it wasn't 7,200 a pound
wholesale?
Oh yeah, no, never.
It was an aspect of it where, where it became massive because in LA it was like, oh, this
is expensive and exclusive and it's not in your bag.
Yeah.
And then people wanted what the, what, what people had.
Yeah.
Right.
And people were willing to pay a shit ton for it.
But we really haven't gotten there with weed yet too much.
There's individual things that break through here and there, but we really haven't gotten
a criteria as to like why this weed or why this hash is nicer and should be more expensive.
Yeah.
You know?
You know, I mean, I even saw there was, there was some shit.
I can't remember what it was.
I, you know, I see that, you know, Chimera is on here.
He was talking earlier this week about he's got RKS that he doesn't want to release because
it's got unique traits in it that he wants to utilize later.
Yeah.
And he doesn't think the market's ready for it.
Whatever those traits might be, you know?
And that could be, that could be true too.
There's lots of times the market isn't ready for anything.
I've always been very good at being at the forefront of stuff and absolutely making no
sales being at the forefront of stuff and watching others come and clean up with it.
It's just about hitting it at the right time when the market's ready for something.
I mean, we talked about that before too, like all that super dog work that me and my, and
my homie did, you know?
Yeah.
It was like years before American seed sellers could really get a toehold.
Yeah.
We had no place for it to go.
Yeah.
You know, we had no place for it to go, you know?
So you know, it's, it's gotta be the right, it's gotta, there's gotta be a balance between
commercially viable and fire.
Yeah.
And it has to match, you know?
So I don't know.
Right now it's like, we went to war with Afghanistan for 20 years.
So it's probably not the, it's probably not the best time to go over there as a white
guy and start looking around for hashish and rare things like that, you know?
You can get Taliban or whatever.
But you know, but they actually have a real culture over there.
Yeah.
It's a real vibrant hashish culture.
And it's just separated from us, you know?
It's always a trip to me with how religiously conservative those areas are, but there still
is a breeding culture or a weed culture there, you know?
So counter to the Muslim culture.
I just, you know, it's like, I think it's one of those things where it's like, it predated,
you know, predated that whole thing.
Yeah, maybe.
It's just kind of like how, you know, like, you know, there's any number of different
things where like Christianity just absorbed certain pagan rituals into itself.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Because they couldn't get rid of it.
Yeah, they co-opted it.
Right?
Yeah.
So you want to bring Allah to Afghanistan, you're gonna have to incorporate some hashish.
Yeah.
Because it's ancient there and they ain't getting rid of it.
Yeah, should have done that with Christians.
Yeah, they should have been dead here.
Yeah.
I mean, well, you know, it just didn't, it's probably an anomaly.
Yeah.
In all honesty.
You know, like it's an accident.
You know, and you know, they probably didn't realize how much effect they were gonna have
a thousand years later or 2000 years later.
I'm sure.
In that regard, you know?
So but yeah, I mean, hash, you know, the hash in America is moving along really quickly.
And I wish I could go back to, maybe I will sometime go back and talk in Holland and stuff
like that and see what what they have right now is their best stuff.
Yeah, that'd be interesting to know.
And just how it affects you.
Yeah, because that's what they all talk about is the flavor and the effect is just unused
can't get it in other shit.
I'll be the judge of that shit.
Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah.
But and they also even back when I was going back there a bunch, it was like they would
grab, you know, like, you know, a certain amount of kilos would hit Amsterdam, and it
would all get bought up by collectors.
And then they all sit on it and hope that they didn't run out before they found something
else of that quality.
And so they'd have a chunk of this and a chunk of this and a chunk of that and, you know,
so on and so forth and whatnot.
And that's what you know, they'd smoke, they'd smoke, they'd almost keep flower for the Americans.
Yeah, that makes sense too.
And then they'd show you what they really were into.
Yeah.
In that regard, you know.
And you know, and so, you know, we're, we, I don't know, maybe there's an aspect of America
where we blend, we blended a bunch of the smoking weed with a bunch of the hashish weed.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well, you know, we took stuff that was bred for smoking, like Thai, Colombian, and Mexican
and things of that nature.
And then we blended it with all this stuff that was specifically designed for hashish.
Yeah.
Like all the Afghans that came over originally.
Yeah.
And that was all bred exclusively for, they didn't, they weren't going for like, does
this flower taste good?
Yeah.
They never tasted the flower.
Right?
Yeah.
They hashed it.
But the hash had to taste, have a taste of its own.
Yeah, but it's different.
It's different when you're burning aged hash versus like a bunch of flower material.
Yeah.
You know, and so we started figuring all that out.
And we started blending it with sativas and blending it with different things and trying
to see how they all came out.
Yeah.
You know, it's weird in the sense that like America and Holland sort of became the two
places, I should say Canada too, North America.
Yeah.
Sort of became where like all the various regions of weed started blending.
Yeah.
You could probably put Australia in that category.
I would think so.
It sounds like, I don't have a lot of familiarity with over there, but like, it sounds like
Australia was another melting pot where they got a bunch of Southeast Asian weed and they
got a bunch of Indians and Afghanistan and Pakistan and blends of different stuff, you
know?
Yeah.
And whatnot.
And so, you know, and there was people too, maybe we could switch bases for a second.
There was people that were asking, which is more Matt's world than mine.
I can let him talk for a minute about what the seed market is like outside of us.
Like outside of the US.
Outside of our like little STS reversals, like what everyone's familiar with.
Oh, this guy's dropping, Cap's dropping something, Matt's dropping something, CSI has a drop,
here comes these people, you know, because we're used to like very small scale, you know,
and I think probably most people think of the last 10 years as what's normal.
Yeah.
But that's not really.
I would think so.
Yeah.
But that's not really what's out there.
I mean, but you know, obviously like, so maybe you could talk for a minute about like, what,
what is it like out there?
Well, I mean, like, so like someone like Pymera that's been around before me, he's going to
have a different experience than when I entered.
When I entered in, you had to fuck with Europeans or your seeds weren't going to sell, you know,
if you weren't fucking with European seed bank and we're trying to do direct, you had
a very, very small chance of getting any meaningful sales because people wanted to buy from seed
banks, seed banks were known, there wasn't a lot of places to do exchanges.
You could always, you know, do it, get down in the DMs on different forums and stuff.
But that was, that was really not cool.
Like it wasn't looked at as a cool thing to do by the forum owners because they were,
they were kind of taking some risk for your exchange, even though it was done in the DMs,
it's still on their server and transaction.
So it wasn't looked upon positively by a lot of the forum owners for anybody to be doing
any exchanges of any sorts.
And usually you'd get banned from places for doing anything of the sort.
So we were, we were mostly counting on, when I entered in, it had just started the British
and attitude wasn't a thing when I first started.
But yeah, most of it was outside of the US.
I think Kevin Stairway was, was that Canada or US?
I think Canada.
I think it was Canada.
Kevin Stairway was Canada, I believe.
Was it Canada where Calrissian was?
I believe so.
Yeah.
I mean, he had the Canadian seed banks.
A lot of them wouldn't pick up American folks.
I remember MedUser, Chris over at Woodhorse Seeds, he was really not friendly to most
Americans.
I think the USPO was around, but you still had a hard time getting them to pick up most
Americans.
So being an American, you had the choice mostly of British or if you were lucky, like a Dutch
seed bank would pick you up.
But yeah, it's, it was minimal.
A lot of it, like when, when I got booted off the attitude, Subcool had asked, basically
gave, given them a ultimatum, me or him.
And at the time there was just me and him that were the Americans on there.
When I left the attitude and unceremoniously left, I had to figure out what was I going
to do?
Was I going to take the risk, be the one American trying to sell direct?
Or was I going to just find another seed bank and get fucked?
So first thing I did was try to operate a seed bank with a few other Americans and unfortunately
chose the Brothel Brothers who were notorious scammers and they got me.
And eventually I just learned, fuck, I got to do this myself.
Or it's not going to work.
And from there, you know, I mean, you could be operating great in the US, but if you weren't
taking credit cards like the Europeans, then you just weren't going to be any sort of competition.
And those were always going to get the sales.
Nowadays, it's a lot different.
Nowadays, there's all sorts of direct buying.
Instagram kind of changed a lot, you know, Instagram made everyone a lot more accessible.
Seeds were a lot easier to sell because people weren't as interested in effect.
They were more interested in learning by looking, you know, oh, that's pretty.
That look, that looks dank became a real catchphrase during Instagram.
Ooh, that looks dank.
But I mean, back in the day, we kind of knew that looks didn't mean anything when it came
to dankness.
I mean, yeah, the weird thing, let me interject for a second, because I'm seeing stuff in
the comments, is that America was an enormous seed market.
Yes.
But everyone that tried to deal with America typically got in trouble.
Yeah.
Everyone in Europe, you know, when they saw what happened in Neville, the Super Sativa
Seed Club just shut down.
And a lot of, you know, seed banks became very hesitant to ship stuff to America.
And then Canadian seed banks sort of took over that role for a minute and started being
willing to ship stuff to America.
And a lot of times they sort of like took the reins from Europe because Europe would
send it to Canada, you know, and it would get and it would get filtered through.
But as, you know, Camaro was mentioning a few minutes ago, Heaven's Stairway went down
because there was an intercepted shipment to the United States.
And that got Cannabis World and Overgrow shut down at the same time.
And well, and we're going to do a full episode on this, me and Flan, but we're going to go
into detail on Silk Road, Heaven's Stairway, Overgrow, Icmag, and how they were all related
in the big bust.
And this is over a period of several years.
I mean, people are still being prosecuted for one major fuck up.
Yeah.
And that's one of the reasons why I used to go to Amsterdam to buy seed in the 90s, was
because that was the most reliable way to get it.
Getting it shipped over was very difficult, you know, and a lot of people wouldn't do
it.
Mark Emery, who had, you know, Cannabis Culture Magazine and all that, and he had his whole
seed company.
He ended up doing, I don't know, five-ish years or something like that in America, in
prison for seed sales.
So there was a big issue with America's, this voracious seed market, but how do you get
seeds there without getting in trouble?
Yeah.
And so, you know, there wasn't, you know, people on IG now, you can see all these things.
And that's why I was joking about, you know, oh, this guy's got a drop coming.
You know, 20 years ago or whatever, when I was doing a bunch of breeding work, there
was no outlet to get that to anyone.
There was no way to advertise it.
There was no way to set up shipping.
There was no way to, I mean, even like somebody like DJ Short, who ended up working with a
bunch of Canadians.
Part of the reason why he worked with so many people was that in order for his stuff to
get out there, he had to work with Tony from Sag Martha first.
And then he ended up working with the Dutch Passion Crew.
Hank, yeah.
Hank, Dutch Passion.
And he ended up not liking that.
And then he ended up working with various people up in Canada.
But he had to work with third parties because there was no way for him to safely distribute,
advertise and communicate with people from America to get seeds out.
Yeah.
So it really wasn't until social media exploded, and IG exploded, and Proposition 215 and medical
started spreading enough that it started calming down.
For all these seed companies, like, you know, think about all the popular, you know, CAP
or, you know, Swamp Boys or these people, you know, Cookie, anybody, right?
All these people came up and their possibilities started in the social media, IG.
Yeah.
So what Matt's talking about is how difficult it was as an American seed breeder to even
find a home that could be a middleman, that could get your seeds out to people.
So, you know, my buddy that I, you know, he doesn't like to be mentioned, but my buddy
I call Staten Island, he kept talking about like, the potential for seeds.
And I was totally dismissive.
Right?
And we were both right.
Right?
At the time, I was right.
He saw 10 or 15 years down the road, what was coming.
Yeah.
You know, he did.
He saw it, but it just wasn't there yet.
I remember making that shift from cash cropping.
I mean, it's a very, very clear memory for me when I had to make that choice of, fuck,
I can cash crop, or I can make seeds.
I'm learning I cannot do both, you know, and having to make something that I know I know
I can make enough money to survive growing jensamea.
That's not what I love to do.
You know, that way that did that slowly was not my passion anymore.
My passion was making seeds and, and learning what I could create, you know, what could
be created in these rooms.
And having to make that decision to only go to seed was a tough one because at the time
they, it was very risky.
There wasn't a lot of money in seeds.
I mean, granted, greenhouse is killing it.
DNA was killing it.
But Americans just weren't killing it at that level yet.
I mean, DNA, we can talk about DNA for a second.
Those are two Americans.
Plumber and the stunt cop.
And they, you know, they, they went to Humboldt and Mendo and all these different places and
they gathered up a bunch of seed and a bunch of clones from various friends, but they had
to go to Holland to make a seed company.
There was no, there was no, in the early two thousands, there was no way they were going
to do an American based seed company.
How would they even get ahold of you?
How would you get ahold of them?
How would you not get busted?
Yeah.
You know, it was, it wasn't, it wasn't very easy.
And so we basically worked first through Holland and that's kind of why Holland became the
epicenter.
Was it allowed it?
Yeah.
Right.
Neville got lucky because he had balls and a bunch of American breeders were fleeing
prosecution in America and bringing him stuff.
Right.
And you know, he got stuff from, from Greg and he got stuff from Sam Skunkman and he,
and he got stuff through Mel Frank and Jorge Cervantes and he got stuff from Jim Ortega,
all these people, you know, because that was the place that it could go.
Yeah.
And then when Canada became the place it could go, that's where it all went.
And then when California and Oregon and Washington started being the place that it could go,
that's where it went.
Yeah.
And it really sucks because there's this artificial line between America and Canada that sort
of kept our two cultures.
It's made it a lot more difficult to, huh?
I'm not going to lie between 2007 and 2010, the fact that it was such a small market,
it was fucking killer.
You didn't have all kinds of competition.
I mean, the best competition I had was like Swerve and Sub at the time and Rascal, you
know, for Americans.
Rascal was, he was at the top of the food chain when it came to reversals, but I mean,
Sub and Swerve, you know.
Yeah, no, I mean, there's an aspect of it, but it's like that, you know, people think
that like, people don't realize how long it took to get democracy where some guy in a
garage could have a 15 lighter or two or three, four lighters or whatever and make some breeding
and do a drop and advertise the drop and let everyone know that it was coming.
You know, I was just thinking about something as far as drops go.
Like I remember when that was looked at very negatively.
If you're going to do a drop, meaning you can hit one male to more than five or six
plants, you were a shitty pollen chucker.
And that was like a mark of shame.
Like drops were not a thing.
And now that's the common accepted way.
This clone or this male crossed X amount of clones and that's the accepted way.
But back in the day, that was not, you were not looked at favorably.
I mean, that's what I did.
So I'm not looking down on anyone for doing it.
I was one of the people looked down on, not favorably for doing those.
I mean, we talked about it before, but, you know, 12 or 14 years ago, the four or five
guys doing reversals were looked upon as cheating.
Yeah, it's cheating.
You're ruining the fucking, you are ruining genetics for good.
You're ruining the gene pool.
You're eliminating males.
You're taking shortcuts.
You're doing this fucked up thing that shouldn't be done.
You're trying to do shortcuts to make a quick buck.
Yeah.
And it went from that and it was, you know, I don't know.
Emery is a douchebag.
I totally agree.
I think most people agree he's a cunt.
That he is not a nice person.
Yeah.
By any means.
You know, I mean, but, you know, there's a there's a lot of people that, you know, you
get to know him and we and you're like, oh, boy.
Yeah, he's not a good kisser.
But yeah, but there's an aspect where it's like, like we've talked about it.
What was it?
It was it was Matt and Rascal and Hyde and a couple other a couple other people doing
reversals. Yeah.
And it was a sea of male female breeding.
And now fast forward 12 years and it's completely reversed.
Yeah. It's like 98 percent fems and two percent of people doing reg breeding.
Yeah. It's rare to see people do.
I've got a reg seed line drop.
You know, it's really weird, too, for me.
Like, I don't do that many femme seed runs anymore.
I really don't, even though I sell the spray and I've been doing it a long time.
People associate me with that.
I don't do them often.
I don't do them very often at all.
And I prefer regular seed breeding because it's so much easier.
It's like a fucking free pass to not fail.
And yeah, it's it's it's a totally different than people's ideas of what fem breeding is
and how easy it is.
It's regular breeding is easy in the sense of getting actual successful pollination.
With real pollination.
With real not not that you're going to achieve your goals.
That's still the breeding.
Yeah, that's a lot of there's still a lot of dead ends and failure, in my opinion.
And sure, you know, and all that.
But but, you know, feminized breeding, even even getting pollen and getting viable pollen,
you know, people have to order.
It's a crapshoot.
People are saying, don't you think the market's telling breeders what they want?
No, I don't necessarily.
I don't think that's it.
I think that finding males is a bunch of work.
And people started doing things where you can't get either one of these two elite cuttings,
but I'll give you a hybrid of them.
Yeah, you can't get TK by Skittles.
Yeah, you know, you can't get either cut, but you can buy a hybrid from me.
And I think that's what started it.
And I think, honestly, it's like people buy what's available, you know, and, you know.
Reversals just you just took an elite cut and you crossed it to another elite.
You took an elite cut and you threw that on 15 or 20 other cuts and boom, you've got a seed drop.
Yep.
And reversals actually really killed the line breeding.
You know, companies used to, we were going to talk about Simon today, tonight, right?
Yeah.
We're going to talk about Sirius a little bit or whatever.
Sirius seeds, they offered the same six lines for like fucking 15 years.
Yeah.
20 years, you know.
Scentsy Seed Bank, you know, when Neville was there or whatever, probably Matt and I were looking at a bunch of the catalogs.
They barely offered a new line for five or six years.
Yeah.
It was the same as shit.
And then in the late nineties, they added two or three more lines.
Yeah.
Back in the day, they expected you to work on your line and refine it, hopefully.
And you had those flagship strains.
Yeah.
Make those lines better over time.
Now it's literally like I did this reversal.
I got X amount of seeds.
They're here until they're gone.
I probably won't make them again.
I gave it a name.
Yeah.
You know, but that's it.
There's no lines.
You can't you can't hit up, you know, you could hit up Sirius seeds throughout the 90s and you could get AK-47 and you could get White Russian and you could get Chronic and you could get Bubble Gum and you could get, you know, whatever.
Right.
And it was just on, it was just available.
So let me let me use this point actually to tell a story.
And you'll like this story because it has something to do with you.
So I gave Natsu some seeds a while back and I was pretty sure I remembered what I gave him.
Right.
I thought I gave him an old pack of AK-47 and I was like, man, when's he going to pop those motherfuckers?
And I would bust his balls over it.
Like, man, where's those AK-47 get them popped?
And he's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm like, fucking Natsu.
Right.
So I bust his balls for at least a year and a half, two years.
Two years.
Every time I lost his fucking ancient seeds.
I'm the old seed guy.
I talk up AK like crazy, all this different stuff.
He sends them to me.
Not only do I not do anything with them, but I fuck him over by like not actually cracking them or like, you won't crack them.
I just fucking ignored him.
And then I lost them and I keep telling him I don't have them over and over and over again.
And I'm like, dude, I gave you these fucking seeds.
What the fuck?
So anyways, I was busting his balls about him again, probably, I don't know, a month ago.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Not that long.
And someone I hadn't talked to for a long time, skunk tech, hits him up and is like, hey, you know, I haven't talked to Matt, but let him know that I have to those AK 47 seeds he gave me.
So.
Oh, I was so happy too, because I called Matt up and I was like, you're a dick, dude.
You gave them to someone else and fucked me and told me that I fucking lost them.
And I didn't remember.
And I'm a stoner and fucking, you know, you sent, I sent him rare shit from the nineties and I blew it off.
But in fairness, he still does have super skunk and Neville's Hayes over there.
But, you know, there's a, there's a, yeah, I mean, in fairness to me, uh, before 2017, there wasn't like biblical fires every year in my area.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't mind the fires at all.
And so that, that ruined a number of seed crops for me and gave me kind of some PTSD and all that.
But yeah, I mean, going back to, going back to Simon, I mean, can you imagine if, you know, whoever, you know, for the last five years,
the swamp boys have offered the same six lines.
Yeah.
Matt's offered the same six lines.
Caleb CSI's offered the same 20 and they just remake them.
And that's what people are doing.
Yeah.
And you get, you're expected to work on all those lines and improve them, but you can, because you're only offering half a dozen.
Yeah.
Now every seed drop is like fucking 20 things.
Yeah.
At least usually, you know, and they're all given a name and they're all given packaging and they're all given this and they're all sold.
And that's that, that's that.
And you'll likely never see them again because the person's not going to remake them.
And honestly, the person, the fucking, the person isn't even usually growing them out anymore.
Yeah.
You know?
So I will say just, just to finish the story, I will give skunk techs a major props.
He didn't even have to tell me that he had those.
He didn't have to tell me that he did selections and made more, and he certainly didn't have to tell not so to make sure I get them, you know,
or make sure I know about them to get them.
So props to him for doing that.
I was, I was, I was pretty fucking cool.
And, uh, there are AK 47, if two somewhere and they're based on the cherry stuff.
So that's cool too.
What's sad about it is that in 1999, um, they changed the laws in Holland, in Amsterdam.
And, um, I should say the Netherlands really, cause only two provinces, uh, are, uh, are, um, are Holland, but in the Netherlands they changed the seed laws.
Where before seed making was legal and they changed it to being illegal.
And most of the big producers in, in the Netherlands got busted within a year or two of that change.
Yeah.
Um, and a lot of seed strains and a lot of lines that were available throughout the nineties then changed because parents were lost.
Yes.
Being Dutch.
Uh, and I'm not trying to be racist is the wrong word or whatever, but just culturally the Dutch are businessmen.
And they won't admit that they lost anything ever.
Yeah.
So if you ask Ben or Alan drunkards, they'll tell you what they have all the same breeding parents that they've had since the nineties.
Yeah.
But we know that's not the case.
And it apparently Simon admitted that he lost a couple of breeding parents in his raid and Collie missed and AK 47.
We're not the same after.
Yeah.
We should also, it should also be said, and this is super fucking annoying for me.
Right.
But that Neville and S super Sativa seed club kind of came first.
Right.
So they just told you where they were, what they were doing.
Yeah.
They didn't have competition.
Right.
So Neville was like, Oh, I got this NL from this person and I got this from this, this, and I crossed them and I called it NL by this.
Yeah.
Right.
And, and he gave you a whole bunch of information on lineage.
Yeah.
And we can go through, we've done it before, but you can go through.
And most of where Neville got his stuff.
We know the name of the person that gave it to him.
We know where he got it.
We know if he got it as a seed line or if he got it as a cutting.
Right.
We know all that shit.
I like Simon and Simon was really nice to me.
Right.
But I don't fucking know what's in AK 47.
Yeah.
I don't know exactly what's in Collie missed.
I've been hunting for 25, 30 years.
What the lineage on that stuff is.
Yeah.
And all the second wave of breeders that came out, uh, sag Martha, serious seeds, TH seeds, Dutch passion.
Oh, you know, uh, um, what's his name?
Um, Luke from paradise.
Yes.
What's in Sensi star.
God only knows what's in what they all started hiding it.
Yeah.
They, they hid where they got it from who they got it from what the mix was in.
Right.
And so it started this massive guessing game of, I love AK 47.
Yeah.
I have no idea what's in it.
I would love for Simon to one day be like, I'm old and I'm just down to say it.
You know what?
I, one thing I will say that's also interesting is from that old pack of seeds.
And I believe they were sold at Simon said, according to the number on it, they were sold in 2000, which meant they could have been made in 98 99.
What was interesting was that the cherry Fino was supposedly popping up.
What would he say?
One in 500 or one in a thousand, something a lot.
It took a lot to find it in the three seeds that popped out of 10 from this old pack.
Two were cherry.
So I wonder if there's some sort of like Viking in it, um, which was a very cherry line floating around Amsterdam at the time that a lot of people were using.
Um, but that's the first thing that, that makes me think that, and I think that's pretty interesting.
It could, you're, you know,
something that I didn't know that it wasn't lost in the bus, that Simon's ex-wife killed them, killed a couple of plants out of spite.
Ooh,
and that it was, it was, it's common knowledge that he lost them.
And I mean, I always heard that he lost them.
Yeah.
But you know, I assumed it was in the bus and he admitted that he lost one parent, but he never admitted that he lost more than that.
Yeah.
But he would just never give up the mix.
Yeah.
He just never,
that, that's another thing that also really confused me is that I don't understand why they would, granted, a lot of them were trying to steal each other's clones and steal each other's seeds or whatever.
But if they were breeders, they would know how expressions in cannabis work, you know?
So they probably, like, I would think that they wouldn't be focused too much on, well, we can't tell them the name or the, the, the line that this came from because they'll get the same thing.
Well, as you're aware, uh, Neville's opinion was they stole most of it from him and didn't want to give him fucking credit.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
He thought everything was his though.
No matter what.
I'm not saying it is.
I'm not saying it's true, but for whatever reason, um, you know, like, yeah.
What's in chronic?
What's, what's, what's Kali missed?
What's, what's, what's AK 47?
What are the parents?
Yeah.
Where'd he get the parents?
Who gave him the parents?
Yeah.
You know, um, all that, right.
You just don't know.
Yeah.
You know, they've never come out and say it and those things came out in the mid nineties.
Yeah.
So we're talking 25 years plus of him being secretive.
Yeah.
You know, and yet Neville had an ego and he thought the whole fucking scene was based on his shit.
Yeah.
And some of it was, but some of it was his ego.
You know, I still think he renamed Afghani one.
I mean, I know you do.
I mean, I'm always, I'm always going to push that theory and it's based on nothing, but I'm still going to push it just because I can.
I mean, one of the things that I learned about, uh, someone just asked what I believe in Kali mist.
Um, I was told by some guys in Amsterdam that, um, you know, that the mother plant was this thing called the mango.
And it was made by this guy that I don't want to name his name or whatever, but it was, it was, he was the guy that came up with it.
And that was at least half of it.
Um, and I, I see people, uh, uh, you know, there's people want to talk about whatever, but I mean,
the thing is, is that when I went over there and when I started going over there in the mid nineties, there was already a bunch of dudes that were middle-aged that all had beef with one another.
Yeah.
And obviously Neville and Sam had a bunch of beef with one another and they sniped at each other for years.
Um, and so there's an aspect, there's an aspect to where it's like, sometimes people just didn't want to give other people credit.
Yeah.
They didn't want it to come from them.
Yeah.
You know, they didn't want it to be that way.
They didn't want it.
They didn't want to be like, oh, well I got that from homie.
Yeah.
Cause homie was a dick to them and their mind, you know, and then they had beef.
And so then there was politics.
You can look at the politics of nineties Amsterdam and you can fast forward 30 years and it goes on today in California.
Yeah.
It's very common.
This is one of the old pictures of Afghani one that has a lot of similar traits to what you will see in things like super skunk or even chem 91.
And that's one of the things that originally put me onto that and seeing any LA Afi cut that we had, that was a Afghani number one selection.
Homie just said, uh, Cali mist was originally called Western winds.
Western winds was one of my favorite all time, uh, cannabis names.
Cambodian, Cambodian.
Something.
That's what they said, but I don't fucking know.
It's supposedly when they were at cerebral together, it was the same thing.
And then they broke off.
Tony called his version Western winds and Simon called his Cali mist, but they were the same thing.
Yeah, they were the, or they, I mean, maybe they, maybe they made different breeding selections or choices, but they were the same, the same origin for the most part.
I will say Tony, Tony has been ridiculously transparent and open with me when it comes to asking any questions.
He's the only Dutch dude who had a seed bank from back then that never like flinches.
When I ask him something, he's always been super open, even if it's not like, even if he doesn't know the answer, he'll tell you, well, I don't really know this came.
I bought it in bulk from X, Y, Z, and that's what it is.
And that's all we know.
He's been really fucking cool about it.
So I got to give props to him for that.
You know, I mean, maybe, maybe he would say what it was, but maybe if it came from Simon or he had B for some guy he didn't like, he wouldn't say it.
Yeah.
Cause that goes on today.
Like people don't want to give other people credit if they don't like the person, you know, or they feel like they got jacked on a, I mean, even like somebody like Sam, like if it wasn't for Mel Frank, I don't, you know, talking about it years later, you wouldn't know that Afghani One and Durban Poison came through Mel Frank.
Yeah.
And he gave them to Sam.
Yeah.
You know, Sam showed up in Amsterdam with him, you know?
Yeah.
And, uh, you know, and then, you know, Tony, Tony has, you know, and then once a line splits, maybe different breeders make different selections.
Yeah.
They lean it towards one direction or another, you know, they lose them.
That's the thing with Adam Dunn and, and the bubble gum and like the different ways Simon worked bubble gum supposedly and all that.
Yeah.
I mean, I know that, I know, I, you know, I didn't, I didn't know until tonight that, that, uh, Simon's X or whatever killed, killed the cut.
But Simon's Collie Mist in the nineties was much more sativa leaning.
And then around 99, 2000, it got shorter and thicker and more, more Indica, more Afghan.
And it lost some of the ethereal qualities that I liked a bunch about it.
You know, that's one that I'd really like to reproduce and we have the old seeds to do it, but I just, it's one of those ones that like I'd spend money and time reproducing it and they would just sit there, you know, and nobody grew it.
Cause Kelly missed really isn't one that people talk about, you know, the average grower still in the U S it's phenomenal.
There's Finos in Western winds and you can look in Western winds and Collie missed, especially in like some mid to late nineties, high times, cannabis cups, like the glossy pictures they would have in those, in those things.
Um, and, uh, you know, and, um, you know, so they, uh, there's, there, those are really nice, you know?
Yeah.
And, um, you know, you know, then, then he comes out and says, it's kind of true.
I don't mean that like Sam took a bunch of credit for it.
I just mean that it was like in the list of stuff that, that Mel that, you know, that he brought to Amsterdam.
Yeah.
And he didn't obviously say, well, I got these two things from these guys and I got these from these guys and here's the three Hayes brothers names that I got these seats.
Like, you know, it was sketchy back then.
Yeah.
So you still can't get that shit out of him.
He'll tell me is that I'm wrong about the ACE three.
Won't tell me what one day, one day.
I mean, it's a, one thing about weed is that people are opinionated and it takes a certain kind of person to take the risks that we all, we all take and the various things that go on.
And, you know, we get beef, you know, and all that stuff.
And so, um, but it's, it's also true that a lot of weed is a flash in the pan.
So it's, it might be around for two or three or four years, five years, and then all of a sudden it's gone or it's not there in the same, it's not there in the same, in the same category anymore.
Yeah.
It doesn't exist.
Um, and there's some, there's some really good versions of AK that still float around.
Um, there was an AK in Colorado that our good buddy working men and I talk about all the time that was a huge yielding beast of a sativa.
Um, and it smelled exactly like Sandalwood did pure Sandalwood turps.
Uh, Matt worked with an AK version that had strong cherry liqueur, cherry and then lemon.
I had a lemon one too.
That was awesome.
And then I had the RC Cola Fino that used to go around skunk magazine and it smelled like flat Cola.
It was, it was pretty uncanny.
So that, that's a pretty wide terp range.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that was a really, Simon didn't have a lot of strains.
But you know, the only, the only strain that I think he had that was absolute bunk, and I apologize if you hear this, Simon is chronic.
Yeah.
And I grew out a bunch of chronic and it was big to discuss it with somebody else and there's no, it's nothing completely off to change.
From prototyping to actual cultivate mixing, it was, you know, like a connector.
you hear this Simon is chronic. Yeah, I grew out a bunch of chronic and it was big and
midsy and ugly. And I never found anything worthwhile in it. But yeah, his bubble gum
and his AK and his white Russian and his Cali mist and all that. That was all real nice
weed. I think white Russian is totally underrated to from all white Russian is super underrated
strain. And it was one of his standards for a long time. And it was killer weed. Yeah,
there was some really nice phenos of it. You know, I wish I knew I wish just for my weed
nerdism or whatever. I wish I knew. I you know, I wish I knew what AK 47 was. Yeah,
like what is it? I think if we're getting these cherry liquor phenotypes is from hexobutyrate
not a turf. But do you think that I mean, because we know that during that time, there
was one real strong cherry kicker that was being used in Amsterdam, which was the either
the Holland's Hope, which was a version of the Viking, or just using Viking and they
were being used widely at that time. So I I've never now that I know that it's just
like and how commonly it occurs, it almost seems like it would have to be in the mix.
We have chimera and crybaby both telling us that the cherries is is from a turtle mouth.
It's not a turf, you know, yeah. You know, it's it's the alls and all the various esters
and all the various things that lead to aromas. That's not an aldehyde. That's not that's
not Matt and I's forte necessarily. There's a lot of learning that I could do over there
that would expand my knowledge. But I would love if he told me what was in it. Yeah. And
it would be really it would be really neat just to know because it's one of the all time
great strains. Yeah, the super cool strain. And it's neat that there's it's neat that
there is maybe here's something that we've talked about and that most people don't don't
think about too much. But we're getting close to the end, but I'll throw it out there. Yeah.
And maybe this is something that like chimera could chime in on or whatever. But what would
happen? Let's say you have two AK 47s or you know, or two NL five hazes or something like
that from the 90s. And you're pretty damn sure that they are what they are, that they're
the exact same era. They're the exact same parents. They're just two different, two different
plants, but from the same seed line. Yeah. If you reverse one on to the other, do you
get a feminized seed line? Because it's not an outcross. And it's not an S1. So so give
me the situation again. Let's say you took, you know, a cherry AK and crossed it to the
Colorado sandalwood AK. Okay. It's not an S1. And it's not an outcross. No. Right. That's
when we make up words like in cross. That's when we make them up because cannabis is unique
and we got to make up our own fucking words. I just mean, yeah, you can do it with anything.
You could take any, any, anything that you know, our sisters. Yeah. And that came from
the same parents. Right. Because most people that are doing reversals, 99.99% of reversals
are either S1s or outcrosses. Yeah. We would, I mean, I know me and Caleb refer to them
as F2Rs just when we talk. So we know what we're talking about, but I don't think there's
any standard term because there's a way where it's like, you know, part of the reason why
we do S1s. One of the reasons why we do it in cannabis at least is because often there's
only one Fino. There's only one living cut of a certain line left. And in order for you
to look within the genetics of the line and see what else might be in there, you have
to cross it to itself. Yeah. We would make normal lines out of a lot of these strains.
Had we a male, yes. Or had we, but if you have two females and you're sure they're the
exact same thing, right, then you could breed two sisters together. Yeah. And it wouldn't
be inbreeding as much because they would have two different genetic profiles. Yes. Right.
It's not, you're not inbreeding to the extent that an S1 would be. No, no, you're not. You're
not isolating traits still. So you take a sandalwood smelling AK-47 and you cross it
onto the cherry AK-47. Yeah. And you, you know, and then you have a, you have a, a feminized
seed line maybe. That's what a bitter did with the P91 S1s took two different P91 S1s
and crossed them together to create his next. But the difference is that those are two S1s
crossed together. Yeah. I'm talking about like two sisters from the same exact hybrid.
You see what I'm saying? That's what it was though. Two sisters from the same. Because
if you have an S1, if you have two sisters from an S1, there's one parent. An S1 has
one parent, right? There's two identical parents. So the genetics is essentially one parent.
But if you take two sisters from a regular line, right? Yeah. Then it's two parents,
you know? And it's like, if you like, for instance, I got multiple daughters. You look
at my daughters, they're not two piece from the same pod. Yeah, obviously. You know, they
have some of, they got, you know, they look very different from each other. You know,
my wife and I's genes popped in different ways in that regard. So you're referring specifically
to an F1 hybrid and then using two sisters from that F1 hybrid, not from a reversal.
Yeah. Like let's say for instance, you took, you know, we can't get, we can't guarantee
this, but let's say you took C5 and crossed it to Cuban black and you were sure, you know,
that you're, or you had two phenos of NL5 haze. Yeah. And you knew that the mom was
NL5 and the dad was haze in both. It was just two phenos in the same thing. Right. And you
crossed those, you reversed one onto the other. Yeah. That's probably one of the most rare
things in breeding because then you'd have a feminized line, but it wouldn't be an S1.
I mean, the only difference between that and the feminized version would be that the
feminized version would have less variation because there wasn't an additional line at
the, what we're calling the parental level. But that's the only difference.
So let's say you take, let's say you make a cherry AK S1. Yeah. You're going to only
have the gene pool that's within that specific, that specific plant.
It would be going in that direction for that specific.
Right. But if you had, if you had a sister of hers, yes. Even though they're sisters,
she probably has a different, a slightly different genetic makeup. So it would be a sibling cross.
Yeah. But it's almost never done because we almost never have to, it wouldn't be nearly
as inbred. Yeah. It wouldn't be nearly as inbred as a, as a reverse cross. And you'd
probably get like a lot wider expression within the seeds.
You know, what's interesting though, what you're describing is almost exactly what DJ
did with blueberry. Two things that were, were from the same parentage to totally opposite
different expressions and constantly recross them from a small population each generation.
I mean, I'm not saying that like in a perfect world, if you had hundreds of seeds, that's
the direction that you should go in.
Oh no, no. But I'm just saying that like, there's, there's an aspect where it's like,
if all you have in the line is one living, living example, then you, all you can do is
self it. Yeah. But if you got two, then you could widen the gene pool just slightly. Yeah.
And have, and have a grip of seeds that had a slightly wider gene pool than you could
get with S1. Yeah. But I think like if you keep like, you
did it with Moonbow 99 and Moonbow 112. Yeah. I think if you do that and you keep doing
it in successive generations, which you get is a lot of mutants and weirdness without
necessarily the, the narrowed down variation. I was just thinking in terms of like 90s weed
or various things where you might get lucky and you might have one or you might have two
or even three phenos that might exist. Yeah. You see them? Yeah. Like where it wouldn't
be that, that would probably be, I don't know, you know, it's just something that's
not often done, but if there's two phenos from the same line, you might be able to figure
it out, but it's almost never done. Think of somebody that, think of somebody that has
it. It's like, it's almost like back crossing to a male. You don't see back, you don't see
back crosses to males often done, but it's an interesting thing. You know what I mean?
It has its place. Yeah. I just, in terms of, I mean, in terms of most genetic preservation,
we're like super lucky if one pheno of an old line survives. Oh yeah, for sure. You
know, but in the case of, in the case of NL5 by Hayes C, there's probably three or four
or five that survived. Yeah. A lot more than that. I think if we really knew for sure,
I think there'd be a lot more, you know, and so there's potential where you could, you
know, you could, I don't know. I mean, it's just interesting in that, in that regard.
Yeah, Project Sea Monster, those are not siblings.
We don't know for sure.
They're not fucking siblings.
I don't think so.
Yeah.
But we've hoped that, we hoped that, that Phylos and some other, and some other genetic
groups would be able to prove these things. And it has not happened. Yeah. Phylos got
everybody's money because they promised they would be able to show what was a grandparent,
what was a child, what was a daughter, what was a mother, and not the case.
And we're still going to do a full episode on that eventually, on why we were able to
prove that it was a broken system, effectively prove it. But yeah, you're going to give it
a little bit of time so people don't get too butt hurt and sue and all that shit.
But it's just one of those things where, do we know whether males or females are responsible
for specific...
There's no specific line.
You know, there's a lot of stuff that, because cannabis for a long time has been... Well,
I was just going to say that cannabis for a long time has been deprived of science
or the science aspect of breeding. Most of it is observational by people still to this
day. There are some people that are doing work that are using a lot more scientific
methods and things like that, but it's rare still. Most cannabis breeding is observational.
It's hard to know males and females. We just were up until 10 years ago or something like
that, we were mostly denied labs. We were mostly denied access to what normal breeders
would be able to use all the time.
So I want to do a giveaway before we're done, since we're almost at two hours. And I actually
thought of something to do, so you didn't have to. So like we used to do back in, I
don't know, a year or two ago, I picked out a phrase. There was going to be a blank spot
in this phrase and whoever comes up with who we all agree is the funniest answer gets the
Bomb Threat Bubba Hawaiian Lights hybrid. It's one of the more expensive ones, so I
wanted to get it out there so people can, yeah. Anyways, so we have a few different
ones. Let me see. Okay, here we go. Here it is, you guys. If you want to participate,
you're going to have to fill in the blank. Rub a dub dub, blank in a tub. Who has the
best answer? Rub a dub dub, your answer in a tub. Who has the best answer?
Oh man.
I know this one should be nice and creative. Rub a dub dub, blank in a tub. Rub a dub dub,
dink in a tub. 12VC in a tub. These nuts is always a great response. Lesbian, fiddling,
tug in a tub, sub in a tub. Oh, that's a good one because that did exist. It did exist.
Sub in a tub is gross. Yeah, I might have to pin this one so we remember who did sub
in a tub and see if someone could beat him. Let's see. Pin. Okay, let's see what we got.
Those pictures of sub in the tub were not cool.
Oh, I remember when I made the, I'm not going to say it since he's no longer with us.
Yeah, they just weren't. They just, you know.
Pre-79 RKS seeds in the tub.
Sub in the tub. Oh my God. Yeah. Hilarious.
Subbing his camera in a tub. Oh my God.
I mean, the thing about sub in the tub is that it rhymes too, you know.
Yeah, I know. It's pretty good.
It's creative. It has a whole thing, you know.
Yeah.
I don't want P-Bud in the tub either. Sub should win. Rub a dub dub, sub is in a tub.
I forgot to wear my P-Bud shirt. I just got another P-Bud shirt from my buddy. Forgot it.
Yeah.
So yeah, I think we're going to have to go with Tri-Grown. Send me a DM after this.
You get the Hawaiian, the bomb threat of the Hawaiian lights. So yeah, it's, it can't beat it.
So we're almost, we're almost to two hours. So we'll do our normal little thing here on Friday night.
Yeah.
So we're down to totally talk. A lot of what we talked about tonight was suggestions from
people on our Discord, asking us to chat about certain things.
That's a great way to get what you want talked about, talked about, is to reach out to us
either on IG or joining our Discord, which Matt always explains at the end.
But we're always down to chat about things. Some episodes are kind of formal in the sense
that we have a whole theme that we want to go off of.
And some of them are a little bit more loose and interactive.
But always hit us up, you know, hit me up on IG, hit me up on our Discord, you know,
right now.
Okay, so you can go to Google, type in Breeders Cinecate Patreon. You can join us on the Discord.
I think there's some fights coming up in a second. We just had some cool fights last
week that we hang out, talk shit to each other and watch the fights, which has nothing to
do with cannabis. But hey, whatever, it's something else to do.
You also get access to my whole catalog collection in PDF form, which I highly recommend if you
are a part of the Patreon. If you don't know about that, go check them out.
It's not just the old SeedBank and Scentsy catalogs. There's a lot of really random,
rare ones.
So yeah, Breeders Cinecate Patreon, go check out right at seedco.com. Hopefully soon we'll
start having more of the podcast show up. We might split it off to a new one. I don't
know how it's going to go, but we'll see. But we'll have the audio form of the podcast
going back up very soon.
Yeah, go check out Speakeasy SeedBank. They've helped us along the way with getting the podcast
and audio form up till this point. So go check them out, support them. And yeah, that's it.
Once again, Friday night. Thank you all for your time very much. It's always super appreciated.
We like talking shit about weed. And so we'll be here again next Friday night. Pleasure.
Yep.
