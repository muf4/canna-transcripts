the idea for this from another youtuber named Jesse on fire and I felt like it
was a fair it was fair for him to ask so I figured I'd do the same. Honor system
reengaged in cannabis. Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0 where we explore the
history of a clandestine scene researching everything from cannabis
strain history old smuggling tales from the first-person perspective to breeding
science and news on current subculture. I'm your host Matthew and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie Notso Dog, breeder and grower from
Mendocino to speak on these subjects and sometimes interview other participants.
Our goal is to document this history before it's written by corporations and
others who just weren't there. Let's start righting some wrongs. Welcome to
the underground. Hey everyone welcome to Breeder Syndicate this is going to be
part two of the Mad Jagger Raho series and of course joined here by my friend
Notso Dog. Peace everyone. So yeah everybody we really had a good time
recording the show last time I think it was probably the largest response we've
ever gotten for any show as far as the positive positivity that we received it
really really resonated with a lot of people and yeah I'm really excited to
start with round two so to speak. We tried to go in a more linear pattern and
we covered some of the the Canyon era but I know we after after we recorded
last time we spoke a little bit and you have some notes and a good direction so
I'm gonna let you go ahead and start Mad Jag. Where do you want to start the tale?
The 1978 map that I drew it says OG stands for original garden. There we go
here's the 1978 map if you want to explain it a little bit and break it
down. The key is at the bottom this is before before skunk number one this is
the very first we had a friend in Kauai who who had Oaxacan Hawaiian crosses
yeah and they're the h10 h9 hk and then we had somehow some a few Thai seeds I
don't know where they came from the Colombian came from my friend and they're
the ones that on Thanksgiving while it was snowing above us on the rim what
weren't even close to being finished so this was the layout of that garden that
you showed photos of last time that's right let's end so well it's surrounded
by pine trees and lots of heavy dark green brush this garden was probably I'm
thinking 100 feet long and 50 feet wide it that was the size this is from the
old notebooks that you have and was this drawn like at the time you were
drawing this as you were looking on or how did it work that's amazing it's
amazing just all of them every year I did one this was at the middle part of
our Canyon the subsequent years 80 79 80 and 81 were about two or three miles
further up the canyon okay this one so this one was closer to 1,800 feet down
it was a longer hike more difficult and the others were anywhere from 14 to 1600
feet down in Wow which makes a difference at the end of the year of
course when you're carrying it this here your harvest out that's why we did as
much as possible down inside the canyon later by having friends come down in and
camp with us because it wasn't feasible to carry out whole plants or branches or
anything like that did you find that any of these grew any different in these
little micro climates in the canyon like any of these strains from like 78 between
70 and 79 if you moved or grew any of the same exact strains in different
locations in the canyon did you find any phenotypic variations I don't really
think so it was it was just more the size and ripeness because this particular
garden was got the Sun East to West so it had the most on 10 11 hours at some
days you know in the summer yeah so they grew much larger plants I mean there
some of these plants were 13 14 feet tall my friend my partner's six foot
seven there's a photo of him reaching up in in his wizard outfit that's right
his reaches at nine feet and there Wow four or five feet beyond his reach so
yeah they were the Hawaiians age 10 and 8 over here where it says age 10 yeah if
you right let's see right over in this region h10 left of this photo or this
drawing where's the H and and also in the middle there H 10 they they were
just massive plants beautiful and it was good smoke too it was will Hocken again
cross with whatever they were calling Hawaiian which yeah has a tie background
just because Hawaii probably in the 40s and 50s people from the Far East that
visited there that it'd be very easy to see those sorts of varieties showing up
in another tropical area sure and that's great this is crazy magic because I used
to um you know I drew a plot like this for you know a map like this for just
about every outdoor plot I ever did and it's crazy to see you know that two
people on you know other sides of the country at the same time are doing the
same stuff but you know beyond the fact that I did it yours is the level of
detail and artistry is way beyond anything I ever did man just this is
really cool to see it really is yeah one thing I might want to ask just because I
remember something you mentioned last time which was basically like you kind
of averaged about 6.8 or 7 ounces a plant or something and then I just heard
you say that like you had these 9 to 13 foot tall plants these Giants so maybe
you could talk a little bit about some of the different stuff that you grew was
a 9 or 3 was a 9 foot or 10 foot tall plant only giving you that amount of
flower because of how loose it was did you have some that were a lot denser and
were smaller plants but yielded more because I have old-timers that would
tell me that back in the day you know they would get ounces that were like the
size of my forearm just because the the weed wasn't as dense and so I'm curious
as to like was the 6.8 ounces the stuff that happened in subsequent years when
you were doing like the skunk one did you get a massive variance of weights
and sizes these first couple years when you were experiencing them just curious
the 6.8 ounces average across the entire two gardens that we did later were all
almost all skunk number one and the tallest plants were six seven eight feet
and the Hawaiian in this particular drawing that were so tall they were
multi-pound plants we didn't have a scale at the time down in there in the
area we brought a dialogram down Oh house good old dialogram it it would go
up to two pounds I think I forget but this plant in particular it it was
obviously pounds of weed yeah they were tight buds they aren't rock buds you
know like some especially the ones I know of friends who grow heavily indica
backgrounds yeah those buds just get rock-hard densities yeah right um these
a pound of this herb probably was twice the size of the of the later skunk
number one the skunk number one were denser definitely yeah I have a quick
question that that I've just been as going through the pictures and stuff
which wizard were you which which color we all pointed out did you this this was
not this was not me this is my friend Doug yeah the the light blue one was my
UK partner that you have in a photo where he's pointing off in well actually
used it in this advertisement yes pointing out into the distance the
garden is actually right below him but we had him pointing in a direction that
wouldn't be as easy to figure out if you got to that Canyon yeah and I I was
never I never wore the light blue one because I think it was a smaller robe so
we had a oh what is the one I'm wearing there's one of me and in my tall partner
walking across the rug there is the white one hey you're right I'm the one
in front and you can just see my beard back then showing a little bit my my ex
wife my kids mom she's the one who sewed these up for us she made all of these
and that red bag there was particularly colorful so she was up with the idea too
and it was great I don't know whatever happened to these costumes yeah I was
gonna ask that was my I didn't keep at least one around but I think 45 years
later you know it's what really pulled me to your story when I first like I
first like I said heard about or even found out what mad jag was going through
Sam's old posts and going through the kilo art and I kept seeing this really
pretty kilo art and said mad jag on it and that's what started that journey and
then when I saw these pictures of the robes is when I was like these are my
people these are my people I gotta find out who they are you know yeah that log
right there that we're walking across there was a storm I was camped on on the
side that this photo was taken from by our third friend and water was almost
touching the bottom of this this log and I had to sit on it and scoot across
with a bag of weed in front of me and scoot across it ran for like three days
from this massive fall storm like in October and it's a good thing that thing
was there else I would have been stuck on the other side and as it was I was in
a silly old army tent and in water was it had didn't have a built-in bottom and
the water was flowing through so I get out in the pouring rain and cut a trench
around it like you do in Boy Scouts to funnel the water away and it's funny it
was a wilderness experience okay you know MJ you remember last week we were
talking about how the how growing these plants kind of turns you into an instant
young entrepreneur and the inspiration you know I've often wondered you know
what kind of what what were your intentions you know when you guys came
up with this whole mad jag branding idea and started sending stuff into high
times you know what was what was going through your head when you were when you
were starting that thing it looks it looks like you know early viral
marketing stuff is what it looks like that's fun yeah viral didn't even exist
that term right that's right we were inspired by high times magazine by the
growers guide and then later Robert Clark's book it just seemed like let's
make our own legend you know and maybe someday we'll be doing a movie about it
or it was it was kind of with that in mind it wasn't that it would make us
richer and we would get paid more for the herb it was just it was set us
apart so that's why we went and had labels made the crack and peel labels
I'll be glad to send you guys some because I've kept a lot of them over the
years oh wow yeah they still work we would I would go through like an
airport I remember I was going up the escalator and I had one cracked and open
I just slapped it on the side of a paper magazine dispenser in Los Angeles and
one of my friends the guy in in Tempe his brother who was a bigger dealer even
than he said did you put one of your stickers in the airport in LA and I said
yeah I did that reminds me so much of like early skateboarding culture you
know in the 70s and that that was you know some of the earliest kind of viral
marketing like you said viral marketing absolutely it the things that they that
they pioneered back then and in skateboarding with skateboarder magazine
you know is is absolutely the foundation of viral internet marketing
today you know social media influencers all that stuff has roots going directly
back to that and I see a lot of that in your magic stuff too Jim yeah yeah I see
I see a lot of that like in the Hayes poster the cosmic boogie poster you know
that's like why I chase that so hard was because as a person who sells seeds
and has made that my passion breeding and all that to me that was the first
time that I could find a physical tangible representation of something I
could possess that was a perfect example of the first strain marketing that I
could find you know and and the magic label I put it in that same kind of
category it's one of those early just things that is striking imagery that you
never forget and it was done so well that I never forgot it and always chased
it it's almost it's almost like a pre Reagan era of freedom where everyone
thought things were about to loosen up yep and then they were kind of loose for
a bit and then they went in a totally different direction for 15 more years
there's all these old posters that you can I found him a few times and I never
bought one but there's an old poster where it's like they made him declaring
like that ah we finally did it you know like prohibitions over and posters but
they were just a little early you know yeah yeah like 40 years yeah just a
little bit one thing I'm curious about and like the actual growing part of it
is since it sounds like you were basically this first season you were
just collecting seeds from friends and people you could get access to what were
the things that you liked and disliked about the first crop like did you look
at those things when you were trying to get away with it and you were like oh my
god this 13-foot plant is blowing past all the bushes and everything else that
we were trying to contain it and like make it look like it was normal I don't
want to do that giant again because it it makes me nervous or like what was the
what were the thoughts there because obviously like this is the first time
that you were seeing a lot of these things grown correct yeah definitely so
what to expect really like you just oh this is what Hawken and this is why in
and this is this and this is that and it was kind of like plant spacing and how
big they were going to get and what they were going to do was all kind of a
mystery I would imagine oh yeah we were I had had the one year before this with
my dealer friend from Tempe in a neighboring Canyon and that's the first
time I got a chance to see plants actually reach harvest time and they
were all Mexican strains like you said but in the next over the next year which
the next year we tried a garden in that Canyon that was massive it was so huge
we had to get a we had to pump up 200 feet to the alluvial plateau we had
found and it wasn't really smart it's a good thing it failed but we got us a
sudden we got a submersible pump that weighed like 40 pounds and hosed going
up and the first time we watered we laid a hose on the ground and it just went it
disappeared into the soil is it this we moved it another 50 feet it's just
made a hole and went down in we couldn't flood irrigate it just it was
so loose with boulders and stuff below even though it was this beautiful smooth
garden on top that it it just didn't work it was like dredging yeah and then
the following year we had collected all these other seeds Thai Colombian and we
and I knew from that very first year how to do it and we just went on a
larger scale these the Colombian though that we had no idea like we discovered
that how long it took to finish we just knew it was super great weed that we had
smoked and we kept the seeds and so these on this garden I'd say 30% of it
failed because it was just it wasn't ready is this the garden that's up here
correct I'm showing so the year you're speaking about this is no this one is
1980 it's we were looking at the 78 earlier they had the key at the bottom
which are you speaking about currently that's when I want to hit the original
one 1978 oh so that's the one that 30% failed yeah and by failed you mean just
didn't finish right they were huge plants that one photo that he has from
last episode they were beautiful plants and slightly different colors because
they were different Colombian seeds but the c10 here c9 wherever the C shows up
they were big big plants that make it easier to see right there if I zoom out
and it might be too much but so eventually did you just end up having to
chop them down did you just and and you just realized they weren't done they
weren't they weren't real weed yet and and composted them down there no we took
them out there they're the ones that I had to scoot across that folder within a
bag once we cut them down to branch size and they were the size of my little
fingertip buds and they were kind of tight and nice and we sold them actually
they they were just a very mild smoke they they had resin but not not like
they would have been super killer weed if they've gotten a month and a half
more or two like the end of December early January like they would in the
tropics but it was so let me let me maybe ask you this because I didn't I
don't think we talked about this last time in the area that you were in what
month or around what date was it safe to plant and then what was kind of like the
latter part of your harvest window where after that it was cold and rainy and you
were in fear of losing luckily those giant Hawaiian plants they because they
were will Hawken crosses to they were ready in October and like no later than
mid October I'd say probably and the rains and cold didn't really hit us
October traditionally in Arizona's the second driest month of the year June is
the driest October and this is in the 70s it has changed since then but we had a
beautiful fall so down in the canyon had cool nights but the days would be warm
and nice so it it just we harvested everything out of this camp out of this
garden except those Colombian and we were going back and watering them and
back and watering them and finally on Thanksgiving when it was snowing up
above and we had to go out on the mesas in inches of snow and big clods of mud
on our feet it was just we decided we have to take them now because we didn't
want to come back any colder and wetter yeah and so you know it just what it
just never reached maturity but the earlier ones all these others the
Hawaiians were came out wonderful and we were able to hang them there in the
shade dry them and I don't remember actually we didn't have breakdown boxes
like we did in following years we just I think put them in our in big bags you
know garbage garbage bags and carry them up top of the rim with our pack frames
we had metal pack frames Kelty's and we would just strap everything to them so
they didn't get handled as well that's another thing that when we had
breakdown boxes after they were met after the skunk number one was manicured
it was put right into these wonderful cardboard boxes that we bought stacks of
and brought them down and then we assemble them down in the canyon taped
them and you could carry six or seven stacked on a pack frame any more than
that they would be catching on branches and it wasn't feasible so yeah that came
out very nice they they didn't get crushed and get smashed pounded at a
time it roughly in each box was that just that that 1979 harvest was that the
one that ended up in the High Times is that what was referred to in that High
Times that is up here on the page and you'll see here it says Colombian stock
killer purple mm we it was it was funny because one guy actually paid us two
thousand a pound for it and then we had some lightly seeded Hawaiian one branch
out of all this garden we came back after as we traditionally did every week
we were looking through inspecting and then we found one branch that was seeded
it had you know her me back yeah yeah the garbage bag and put it over quickly
cut that branch off but it had enough time to lightly seed a few of the
plants neighboring to it but people love finding those few seeds and they were
like do you have any more of this yeah they like the smoke and it was the
Wahak in the Hawaiian kind of Wow and so how many of these in this list are from
you guys on this yes just the one that says magic Hawaiian magic since Amina
got and all these others were current things on the market yeah I mean like
downtown that's something we didn't actually chat about last time but it's
pretty interesting when you guys were doing your gorilla you know obviously
like you can get a wildly divergent amount of males and females off a batch
of seeds did you plant everything in your alluvial planes and all that and
then just cut males as they appeared did you plant them in pot you did yep and
did you go out there more than once a week when things were turning from veg
to flower so that you didn't show up and all of a sudden the stray male it like
nuked a whole patch with seed or how did you handle the transition when you were
worried about maybe we haven't caught all the males yet right well the next
garden that was 19 marked as 1979 as the double e the reason we called it the
double e is it was on a topo map right under the word Creek where the double
E's were and so we went oh that's an easy way to spot it so you called it
doubly we spent three nights I mean three days and two nights every week on
the next three years we didn't just go out overnight and water and then leave
the next day so we were there three days out of seven and we anything that was
even remotely spooky looking like wow this might be a male change in here we
then I don't know we might have just prematurely cut them out but everything
was grown from seed and the the year we ran two gardens of our big big here the
one garden good thing I bought 3,000 seeds because the plants were about a
foot tall and we came back a week three days later four days later and grass
hoppers had eaten them down every single one unbelievable we had to replant on
the 1st of June oh yeah we put them in a tiny seed garden area where we could put
a screening over it and they were super crowded and we were just digging them
out with wet with inner palm in our hands and plugging them in plugging them
in plugging them in and replacing everything that had been eaten by and
what was weird there was a few plants that made it through from the grasshopper
plague and the ones that we planted and they were like a month month earlier
than the ones we had to replant in June maybe more than a month and the June
ones caught up with them it was amazing because of the hundred-degree weather
and the Sun and the watering by the time end of the summer like let's say August
was around they were all equal yeah that was good but having that little six
foot by ten foot garden full of seeds luckily week we were able to replant
otherwise it would have been catastrophic oh I bet I mean maybe maybe
another angle is where did you first learn about what an early female or an
early male even looked like back then was it Rob Clark's book was it high
times was it people telling you you know because obviously like now you know like
you look at it and like two pistols mean a female and a little claw looking thing
means a male but back then did you have that kind of knowledge beforehand did
they get kind of advanced before you realized what they were well I I'm not
exactly sure I know from the first year in 1976 that we grew I got to see what
males look like and females but not till they were probably more advanced
invisible I think Rob Clark I mean his early book the one that he did in 77
on pod press that was actually his dissertation yeah yeah that he he hand
drew all the drawings in there oh yeah it's cover every single plant he hand
drew those so he's not only yeah he's a he's a good artist plus his photography
later man he says when he would travel around and did that book on hashish the
photos are just excellent you know no watering and the growers guide by Mel
Frank that I think showed I don't know if they were photos but it it was a
learning curve but by this year this I had already grown for two years before
this so not the original garden but by 1980 so when we went for two gardens at
once we had enough experience to know what to look for plus we were spending
three days a week in the garden and I think maybe even at the time when the
males had to be separated we might have just had one of our we had a third
partner who helped us part-time and he was from Switzerland he's still a good
friend of mine I saw him when I went to Spanibus in 2019 and stayed at his house
and he's he's five years older than I am he's he still smokes hash mixed with
tobacco he's been doing for 50 years as the custom over there yeah yeah and he's
an artist of course Swiss artist and he may have just been down there and as
because I know what you're saying we ended up it was almost 50-50 with the
skunk 50-50 males 50-50 females it was we didn't end up with big huge empty
sections of the garden and we also transplanted into any open sections if
we had to we would dig up a plant that was four feet tall with a big root ball
and slide it over five more feet to get it into a hole that had more Sun and and
was empty because a male had been removed yeah we did a lot of
transplanting and movements it was experimental to see if it would work in
it yeah they're very hardy plants yeah there was resilient the term weed is is
accurate I mean wow yeah you know you know Jaggie we last week we talked about
the turps and flavors of Colombian and and you know you were just talking about
that first year where the Colombians didn't finish but you got a few purple
ones out of there that were you know that were made good smoke but you know I
wasn't really satisfied with my answer last week when when I was asked what
what did I you know describe those those flavors and smells coming off of
Colombian and you know I realized as I thought back on it that you know that
most of my experience and what I know about Colombian is more about what came
imported you know and was bought then what I grew because it just it was just
so difficult to pull those things off and so you know for me it's it's such a
treat that we have you know we have it's the the essence of it captured in in the
O'Hays as Sam shared it you know that that because otherwise it's so hard to
grow you know growers all over the country were like they tried and it
didn't turn out well and then they found something better and the stuff just kind
of disappeared so but you know can you talk about that that Colombian the
smells I mean that did the anthocyanin or whatever the the purple yeah did that
really take over and dominate the one that you managed to harvest and or you
know no they were they yeah because it was like you know it was Thanksgiving
and as you know when the light starts dropping down the purple tends to happen
more and it it didn't really have a characteristic the Hawaiians that were
Wahakan crosses they had a wonderful scent growing but the Colombian because
they didn't even have the tiny buds till like late October beginning of
November they they didn't it wasn't warm like the hot summer end of the summer
they didn't have really much scent at all until they were dried and then you
crushed them yep but the I know what you're talking about the piney that's how
you would you know focused on the piney last week and and that's you know I had
a lot of that too then and you know like I said all my school all my friends at
school everybody was growing these Colombian plants and Christmas trees
everybody had these little Christmas trees out there but some people they got
more mature and you know you got you got a really nice buds but the pine was was
dominant for sure but you know that the diversity of what we got in the imported
smoke was just above and beyond you know because the golds and the reds and
yeah yeah just some amazing stuff you know and and distinctive you know each
one just such a unique distinctive thing just like Mexico all of them you know
whether it's in a low or Guerrero or Oaxaca yeah entirely the way they look
they smelled and the highs too yeah Mexico's a long country Colombia is
pretty big but there's in Colombia it was like tropical versus yeah 5,000 foot
level versus Santa Marta way up at 8,000 9,000 feet so it they were land races
that didn't really get mixed up too much back in the old days at least until the
60s maybe yeah and the impact of the processing and transport to you know
whatever it was in Colombia before it went on the boat or in the in the case
of the high-grade stuff like the golds and the reds you know maybe on an
airplane you know that that had such an impact on it too but I think a lot about
the commercial stuff that that you know we used to buy on the street or sell
even and you know what what I think is interesting is that the essence of that
you know that it was a shadow of what it was when they when they finished it yeah
yeah but the essence of it point one thing that we could throw in there is
that a number of people that have talked to Matt and I about growing in that era
when they first grew green marijuana they got scared because they didn't
think people would want it because all the stuff they got was brown or yellow
or that's why that's why I asked last week if they if they sun-dried because
that tends to be the way that the Mexicans and stuff we're getting their
goals like girdling or sun drying but we've heard that consistently that a lot
of times the first home grows or the first outdoors that people did in
different regions they're like oh my god it's such a weird color it's green are
people gonna like it they've never seen it before and like obviously like now
it's shifted but I'm curious is when you did your when you did your your shade
drying and stuff like that what kind of colors were you getting was it staying
green was it turning golds and yellows and browns no gold yellows or browns
just greens or dark greens that the skunk number one was super dark green
I'm just yeah interesting day but even in 76 when we my dealer friend and I
grew that first year the proof was in the pudding we would give people a smoke
just one puff or two and they were overwhelmed if they were used to
commercial stuff and seedless they had not seen seedless really unless they had
gotten tie sticks tie sticks were pretty much always seedless and the tie
sticks back then were not green they were browner you know in your right
always colored all of you maybe but the light green you're right I didn't even
give that a thought because once our few people that bought from us smoked it
that's that's all they cared man they bought everything two people bought
everything we grew basically that's so because we heard we heard people telling
us stories about how when they first grew green weed they tried to brown it
up because they were like oh man no one's gonna want this it's not the right
color right doesn't look like anything we've ever had we need to do something
it's it's this is wrong well and not only that but some of the earliest you
know when people have a bad experience with green weeds so you know the guy who
grows a you know a patch full of Colombian and it doesn't finish and he
harvests this leafy stuff with just a few white hairs and mostly tops and and
you know he handles it poorly it's loaded with chlorophyll and he tries he
sells it to people and and you know all of a sudden there's this bad reputation
green weed is bad right and then the next year people grow different seeds
this shit gets mature they handle it better you know and all of a sudden
there's there's high quality green weed but people's perception of the color is
that it's a turnoff so you got to try and overcome that getting them to you
know try it listen this is different or whatever or or the thing about renaming
or changing the appearance I mean a lot of people would you know we knew that
the stuff molded but you know that the Colombian that turned it brown it was
some sort of mold from being pressed when it was still wet or carried in the in
the cargo bay of the ship or whatever and so since we've been smoking that
stuff for years and then you know people thought that was okay and they might
try and you know they might try and press some other wet homegrown and get a
different appearance but it never turned out like the Colombian you know and it
only wound up making it worse but that chlorophyll was pretty horrible to smoke
if you had those unfinished tops that somebody was trying to pass off as smoke
and you know and plus high times was you know was was becoming really popular and
people were hearing about green from Hawaii and California at least by the
time I was in it so that the thing for us was you know I mean I would I had
produced some amazing freaking indica buds but I would say it was Hawaiian you
know or from California just because you know you're homegrown isn't you know
because I was charging 200 an ounce for this stuff and people were happy to pay
it even though you know as kids they didn't have a lot of money they would
find a way I had a guy I had a guy trade me a PA system with you know with a
beautiful mic and a fender backstage 20 for a half ounce of purple tie and he
loved it he loved it so much he came back for more and unfortunately I was
out of that and all I had was the green Fino which didn't finish at all and I was
like okay well you know I knew it wasn't the same stuff but I wanted the money so
I sold him that second bag and and he was so pissed off because I wound up
giving his money back because it wasn't even close to the same thing as the
purple one man so with with the skunk one did you notice any like solely broad
leaf expressions stuff that looked just pure Afghani in the skunk one top well
one of the photos that you posted last week I think what was interesting about the skunk
was it it grew like long colas and they were almost self-pruning in the fall the the sun
leaves would all turn yellow and you could just shake the plant they would fall off and leave
these long green colors and I have one photo on from that I took that is just slightly blurry
but it's just a series of these four four to six foot tall colors you know like one cola coming out
of the ground and those are the ones that were 6.8 ounces you know on average it was dense and
nice very deep deep green but there was no indica fat leaf expressions solely it was uniform
it was truly true breeding at that time what Robert and Sam had accomplished I think Robert was
more the geneticist in doing it but there's some some place in the history where they said they had
10,000 things going in red cups and they chose from that and I don't know if that's accurate but
I'm not sure yeah it it really um when we planted it it grew the way it looked each plant they had
a little bit wider leaves certainly than like Acapulco gold or Santa Marta or tropical thin
leaf but nothing like the deep chunk or maple leaf indica's that you know people add on on
icy mag that look just like you know umbrellas almost you could yeah your head if it's raining
dinosaur leaves yeah exactly was it your impression then I mean obviously you said before that you
reached out to um you reached out to to Rob through a letter and contacted him and he brought
you the seeds is what you said previously um when did you meet Sam back then did he talk about their
partnership did he did they did he tell you any of the work that he had done to get to skunk one
um did he share all my info came from Robert I never met Sam I've never talked to him personally
I've private messaged with him on Icy Mag in 2012 but nothing um I've I've sent him some labels
for his collection but I don't I've never met him it was all second hand from Robert
when he described um and I I don't know if Rob was when I got on when I got on there Sam was very big
that's where I saw all of his collection of of you know essentially breeder art and grower art
that they would that they would make and attach to their pounds um he would post a lot in something
called I was was it called the breeders lab maybe something like that yeah something along those
lines but he was pretty active in that um and so I was just I'm just always curious as to about like
what you know had did Rob tell you how long he'd been working on skunk one when he gave it to you
or any kind of like any info along those lines yeah that you know he worked in Ben Loman which
is a little town up in the redwoods just above um Santa Cruz you you might go through Ben Loman
for instance if you're going to go up further up to like La Honda where Neil Young lived still
a distance from San Francisco and he told me that that's where he they had their little underground
greenhouse going and and but he made it sound like it they had been doing it for a year or two
before he never went into the history of these other neighbors in Santa Cruz that Sam knew that
were the two brothers and yeah um all those stories those I read more about later in on
ICMAG and people disputing it and one person saying oh no it was this and that so um yeah he
he he mentioned though that he had been working on it I bought his 1977 treatise um not from him I
don't know where I found it but somewhere online and then when he came out with marijuana botany
you know everyone bought it but if it wasn't for the growers guide Mel Franks we would have failed
because when we had that year the second year where we got this twist on the end of all of our
plants and they were already six foot seven foot plants we were like freaking out because they were
supposed to be getting flowers and instead they had the leaves twisting and we he talked about
micronutrients and how you could have a you could be short and a couple micronutrients in your soil
and that could make the world of difference so we got some concentrated um
seaweed extract which has 90 different sure yeah minerals from the ocean nothing even comes close
and we bought a big backpack pump sprayer filled it with water I think it held two gallons and just
walked around and sprayed the plants and I think we did it once and waited a three or four days and
then we did it again and but by the end of a week or eight or nine days they were all untwisting
so whatever what they were missing and it was because of Mel Frank's book about my talking
about micronutrient problems um we kind of zoned it down to being molybdenum
lack of molybdenum you know what's what's amazing about that to me is that uh many years later in
1993 when I was planning on growing for the first time two of the three books that taught me things
was uh Rob Clark's uh marijuana botany and Mel Frank's grower's guide yeah you know there were
different editions by then obviously they'd been through some revisions and things as time had gone
on but the same knowledge uh to a young kid desperate for it so that's pretty cool that that
growers guide there was nothing that even came close when it first came out I mean there were
bibles really yeah it really was really was fantastic mine got so dog-eared I put some
like rings through it uh to hold it together and I passed it on to you know another another guy that
you know wound up growing and breeding and taking seeds to dead concerts and stuff which was pretty
pretty foreign to me as a skateboard punk rocker you know yeah interesting Mel it was I think I
can't remember there was three people involved in that book Mel Frank and Ed Rosenwald the two I
remember off the top of my head but there was a third author uh that was that contributed to it
to some degree I still have the books at my house was Ang Lee no he's he's another photographer
yeah that's it right there yeah that's the one yeah that book that book I probably read a hundred
times in in six or eight months before I set up my first indoor because I had no idea what I was
doing let's see when you got it not so it was probably called the indoor outdoor marijuana
growers guide but the original one was just growers guide growers guide yeah indeed I indexed
my books so that I could go in there and find whatever page I needed to really quickly um
and then on the marijuana spurs guide yeah more stuff you know five hours minimum
I think it's probably hard for young people today to like conceive of just how sparse and hard to
come by some of this information was because they're used to the internet and typing things
in and forums and resources but it was really limited back then um in terms of what you could
access and you know and how to learn and so those books played them obviously even with you guys
even with you guys they played a massive role in uh in teaching people exactly how to pull off a
successful crop this is the first first year it came out 1978 this is the first edition and or
press in Berkeley and mine is kind of falling apart so I understand what you're talking about
um oh look what's one of my book markers in here I didn't even remember oh yeah look at that
that's another one so I have at least two of them um and we used to we used to go to the library and
I mean I would search for everything on hydroponics because I even growing outdoors I was
doing outdoor hydroponics in in 1981 you know um five gallon buckets filled with peat moss cow shit
perlite and vermiculite and then you know fed with eco grow um you know granular two-part mix and
yeah so I went to the library and I started researching hydroponics and basically I stole
any good book from the library that hydroponics and uh kept it you know it was uh very much
soul study this is the book um what we were referring to the the Rob Clark thesis it's
called the botany and ecology of cannabis this is my copy that I scanned in is it loaded on the
screen they're numbered mine's not mine's actually not no it's one of the few that's not um Clark
actually uh the one of the few times that he's ever responded about anything was to give me the
print run on it and apparently there were I think 1500 total um where it was a first print of 500
and a second print of a thousand but you can't tell the difference between the two some are
numbered some are not but another example this is he he drew this by hand and all through the book
this book are his drawings yeah extraordinary I can just imagine him getting wasted and just
sitting and just digging drawing I could not draw that by hand no no they're they're beautiful
drawings in here like and that's one of the things like I've been sitting on it forever
and you know it's not really out there for people to see but there are some of the most beautiful
drawings of cannabis and the in the cannabis part the parts of the cannabis plant by little taxi
and they're seen yeah it's it's crazy he did such an amazing job back then to me it it definitely
yeah it kind of it kind of you know it kind of reminds me of early early botanists and explorers
geneticists they travel around you know different islands and stuff and discovering dodo birds and
things like that and sitting around drawing in their sketchbooks describing the fauna and flora
of these these exotic locations it's just gorgeous and he got it so accurately I mean just they
looked exactly right the the indica plants that he he drew in marijuana botany were just spot on
you know yeah and uh the elegant the elegance of the branches and the leaves that he drew I I just
I I always I didn't know if he drew them or somebody else did but I did I asked him yeah
he drew him I just thought they were gorgeous yeah there's another book he did called hemp
that was released in Germany that has some beautiful illustrations of his and um but it's
not available in the United States but if you guys can trace down a copy of hemp which is German for
him um there's more beautiful drawings from him in there cool if you zoom over to the humbled
up here on your list the article that I found on humble growing I thought not the dog would
find this interesting it has a it has Rob Clark in the corner here when he's 29 years old oh wow
sure does holding a bud and it's in color but I I only scan in black and white because I
might I'm running low on the other well actually I could have scanned it that's true
it's okay this works I wasn't thinking about it but I I met him I I think this article is from
about 1982 because they mentioned something the price of marijuana in 82 so yeah right up here
yeah in 82 an estimated 1.8 billion dollars of street value yeah so he was 29 in 82 if so you
can go backwards and figure that out how old he is and and I met Rob he came down to Negril once
with his wife at the time and I was we hung out together for a few days in the girl
and the concept was he was going to look for some you know land races there Jamaican I yeah
didn't see him after those first few days but I think he traveled around a bit
but this is great because it talks about the helicopters and in Humboldt and at this time
I'm so glad you saved this stuff the second photo I figure where it is oh well one of the
one of the interesting things about when helicopters first started flying is that
people were growing all these giant sativas and the hills and Humboldt and Mendocino and nobody
as long as you were tucked away nobody cared how big they were because no one was looking for them
and so there's articles I've read where like the very first gardens that got busted by helicopters
they actually chopped down most of the gardens with chainsaws yeah because the the stalks were
like this they were so big and thick and the people weren't worried about about getting caught
so they just had these ginormous you know these huge sativa plants oh goodness look at that yeah
right gangster oh that's that's that's pushing a certain narrative not at all
that old chainsaw thing uh was that's that was common down and where I was living too you know
the national guard helicopters were flying uh looking looking for the crop and you know when
we would go out when I went out to my gardens I was always dressed in camouflage um you know the
whole guerrilla mindset leaving no trail you would create a trail to your spot where you would go from
step to step always putting your foot in exactly the same spot that you did the time before
you know crawling under bushes and stuff to it was um yeah you're probably familiar Raho we have
we have a bunch of manzanitas yeah in Mendocino county which are for people that aren't familiar
they're kind of these like smooth limbed bushes that get anywhere from 6 to 12 feet tall
and you can kind of thin them out underneath and a lot of people grew in manzanita patches
because you could still get some filtered light but it wasn't going to be totally exposed so uh
crawling around in manzanita patches and and cutting off lower branches to make spots for
gardens is is like my first outdoor experiences what are you holding up there right there sir
can you zoom in on this this is these are humble photos from that same article let's see here
i'm gonna try to zoom in a little bit no he's holding up something on his thing matt oh okay
let me see over here on uh you might know it's not easy to get back to hold on there we go there we go
um damn it matt oh look at that here's some guys pruning their a father and son pruning some big
leaf plants too yeah and they both have 38 caliber weapons in their back pocket that they point out
in this article and a guard dog and then here's an aerial shot of a huge garden like the chance
you're just grabbing um people took that risk but it didn't always work once the helicopters came
the helicopters dramatically changed people's approaches i'd bet yeah to a huge degree because
most of these things were grown in in like like you know i mean that's super easily visible from
the air but like not not from driving around that's him yeah the color yeah the color difference
is just so obvious from the air you know it did the tactics for hiding this stuff became
you know pretty well look at those pretty creative these are your humble sheriffs
yeah in the garden that they just dismantled you know that newsweek magazine um mad jag the
that came out that at the same time there was another article i can't remember if it was time
or it was a national publication where they came out with an article talking about this new
high potency kind of super weed that was that was you know flooding the streets called skunk
yeah and i've been i've been i've been looking for this magazine or this article ever since and i
honestly i thought the reference was in that newsweek that had the guy with the mask um and
the and the m16 but um it's it wasn't you know i've read that article since and i don't think
there's a reference to it but they described the effects of skunk in that article it's it's classic
reefer madness you know writing yeah um you know but they honestly they got it right and they
they described the appearance of it they described the effects and uh it was pretty spot
on for what i thought skunk was tears what is this one a reason for tears look at that this is um
from the state of of utah and it's a it's an entire reefer madness basically um about
you know what's really bizarre is this high school undercover it's an article about guys
who look at he's got a heavy metal t-shirt but he's shown his badge and it's a whole article
about going undercover in the various high schools in utah like 21 jump street like the tv show oh
yeah i mean i'll tell you this is obviously so much later but the first time that i ever saw
a guy with waist-long dreadlocks tackle someone and then put cuffs on them oh wow and on dead
tour i was like oh man you know are these buds labeled in this picture they do look labeled
don't i can't read what they are but they do look labeled yeah yeah the top ones they're
labeled like hawaiian maui stickless tie orange columbian they spell columbian wrong too
always spell it wrong since i'm here michoacan maui so they had some really good um photos here
of different things that they had confiscated o'hocan red columbian red guerrero gold
wow i always love those pictures the reference pictures from point of origin and time are so
valuable so so so valuable but it's hard when it's cops you know taking the pictures and you
got to hope that they got your bag right and got this kept the strange name with it and shit
i think if it's your bag you probably got other things to worry about than
indeed freaking provenance you know i mean one thing one thing that i think is kind of interesting
too and it's it's it's obviously we don't need to dwell on it too much but i do think that like
from what i'm listening to and you guys are talking about all these different highland and
lowland columbians and all these different regions and stuff like that and all these different
mexicans and what they were i kind of think that like the cocaine trade and profitability with that
sort of blocked off the next generation of americans from being able to experience that
because the groups that were all bringing in those columbians and bringing in those mexicans
they shifted to a more profitable thing and then it also became unsafe for people a lot of times
that looked like us to go down to those regions and get those things so there was this era it was
two things that were happening at the same time yes the cocaine you know became much more profitable
for the same people that you know were formerly smuggling cannabis but at the same time the
american you know homegrown market had had happened and and that product was just such a
higher level of quality than what what the imports had because of the freshness and you know the
introduction of hard-hitting uh hard-hitting indicas and in their high tell me what what
year do you think that was 80 82 83 oh wow yeah because i mean we don't need to sidetrack on it
but there's been an interplay between like what mexico and down south does versus what's going on
in america and like each one responding to the other in terms of cannabis that's been going on
for i guess that's not that's not a sidetrack at all as a matter of fact it's another mad jag story
yeah because can we dive on into that i think that's a good idea i would love to i mean that
the the story about you know how you know mad jag's uh contribution to the to the the the
mexican uh cannabis gene pool my peoples you represent my people in mexico all right so how
did that how did this start happening what era did the um the mexico stuff start occurring at
and how well the last year i grew in mad jag canyon was 81 so by 82
i i knew a guy who was a pilot and it's not the pilot i wrote about like um
that you know when we talked about 60 tons of packy hatch yeah this is a guy i met him when
i was working a regular job at a truck loading place i worked for georgia pacific for two years
in phoenix in the late 70s and this guy one day he walked up to me i was loading his truck up
with empty plastic bottles which is what they produce at georgia pacific and he said uh hey if
if if i found a whole bunch of of weed out in the desert um could you sell it i said what
i had short hair too but he just figured he felt that vibe the vibe and and i said what do you mean
he says well i was flying over this area and i see where someone jettisoned one an empty fuel canister
and it's stuck in the ground and i'm going to go out there and check it and i think it's they were
smuggling weed and i went sure man just let me know and he came back a week later and he was all
disappointed because it was just an empty fuel canister damn and it was actually air force that
had dropped it and it was stuck in the ground looked like a bomb you know yeah it didn't explode
but then he started talking about other things and then all of a sudden like two months later he
comes back and i'm loading his truck and he says um i i met the people in mexico and and i said what
and so he's he stole a twin engine cessna from scottsdale airport flew it to guadalajara and gave
it to the cartel to prove to them that he was not a narc that is a gangster i love it i know
later he stole a helicopter out of apache junction and flew it down but he only got 20 miles into
mexico before something went wrong mechanically and he had to crash land and hike his way back
and the fbi came to his house because he found his fingerprints in mexico on this and he denied
everything so they couldn't do anything scared the shit out of him but i bet the good lord
they brought several loads up of weed i found an airstrip in along the mogollon rim in a small town
area way out by itself and they were like within five minutes they said they would be there at one
o'clock they were like they're at 105 kicking out bales onto the aircraft and they would they would
bring 500 kilos each flight and that's where one of two of the flights had labels already in them
from someone who was supposed to get them in california but something went wrong and we got
them instead i'm still i'm still hunting for those labels i've got them somewhere but um anyway
so you had a connection with those guys yeah it was 82 and 83 el bufalo that rafael carl
quintero um you could see it from space it was a square couple miles you know they show it in that
tv show um narco mexico yeah so that's that's the name of the garden or the farm el bufalo
rancho buffalo and was this at the beginning of the the um gallardo era of the
yeah development well this is when they were just doing weed yeah exactly what happened was
they they grew thousands and thousands of hectares of of uh weed but they didn't have anyone growing
seeds seed crops so they they were desperate for seeds and so my pilot friend along with my other
friend who was the weed dealer in tempe we filled two quart size bags half full and he stuck one on
each of his cowboy boots and flew to aloha and gave it to them and they were so grateful because it
they they had no seeds yeah so unfortunately i was part of this because seeds from five different
zones in mexico ended up in their hands and became the new hybrid and um oh well
why would you say in 1980s dutch genetics were already in the grill of jamaica and the
people go wild over them they were growing them up in orange hill and all this so land races were
getting squeezed out and um to find true jamaican i don't think it's there anymore yeah so there's
probably some land races still in stashed spots and certainly in columbia but boy jamaica being a
little island so maybe you could clarify for a second then those seeds that you brought down
or he brought down smuggled in his boots what were they a mix of they were a mix of guerrero
sin alone mishoa khan o'hacan that my dealer friend and tempe had high graded over the course
of like two or three years he had bags the best of the loads that had passed through the loads
and so that's why you were like oh you were a little bummed about it because you kind of mixed
the strains and then they started growing it and then instead of it being like a regional thing
where these specific kinds were coming from it was sort of a blend coming back right and we have
no idea el bufalo got discovered um i wrote down this november 14th of 84 is when they found it and
burned it and it actually the smoke affected people within a hundred mile radius because
they burned 500 hectares and they estimate that it was worth 2.5 billion dollars at that time in
84 so there's a famous million it's a famous scene in narcos where he um i can't i think it was it
was guy arnold's brother raf is that brother it produces in the in the in the series like this is
the super the super strain that the sinsamiya um right was this before or after you met him that
or is this the the hybrid that you're talking about well we gave them seeds in 82 and 83
and el bufalo was captured and burned i don't know if it ran for years before that
but just in general they king taro was growing weed in other places but buffalo was like their
huge place they had their own wells drilled there um it was in sinaloa um and i've i've read about
it in a book called the underground i forget i've got the book it's like 900 pages long and it's
written by a dea agent who's in charge of all the stuff going on then and it has three chapters one
on heroin one on cocaine and one on weed and the one on weeds about el bufalo being spotted by a twa
pilot or something they're flying over and they went what in the world and they just mentioned it
casually that's where kiki camarena got a job and went and actually penetrated it and in the second
movie of sicario so popular it's kind of similar because he's dressed up as a compass you know and
he gets a job um kiki is the is that the that's the name of the de agent that got killed yeah yeah
yeah and that caused a huge amount of problems oh yeah that was it just left it alone you know
but they didn't um and that's when they were switching over to cocaine just about
84 85 i think that being burned king taro um from what i read just became a
an addict of you know drug addict of whatever um because he was he was sad he didn't want to
see them go into cocaine but rafael um miguel angel felix gallardo he went ahead and went
you know he became he formed the first cartel with all these loose clauses that were existing guys
over here guys over there and i stayed at his hotel in 84 one of his many he owned apparently
a lot and my friend who was the pilot we went down there and my friend from colombia found his way
there from colombia and we all had a big party and they were hoping that my friend from colombia
would be able to turn them on to newer connections and stuff i don't know really what happened
because he loved to do coke but he and i both decided we didn't want to be in that business
yeah and the pilot this guy he he kept going they were using our airstrip the one that we had found
for weed 1600 to 2000 pounds of coke at a time they did nine loads and then they an off-duty
sheriff who was cutting wood saw them landing and unloading and they got busted and um i have no
idea what happened it was in the newspaper i've got a clip i've i've posted before i think on ic mag
but i i never met i never met miguel felix but um my partners did i did enjoy his hospitality because
we went into this hotel room and there was a just like in the movies a plate with a four ounce pile
of cocaine on it and two other guys who did nothing but just bring cases of beer all through
the days that's nice of them yeah sounds like a weekend at not so's place i guess yeah it is it
is except except there's a lot more men a lot it's crazy matt loves that if he doesn't at least
once a show try to throw me off my game with something like that he's upset so uh you know
he found his opening and he took it yeah that's what she said but i mean just just you know raho
to that that whole thing is just crazy but when i when i was when i was starting to do gorilla
in california one of the things that the mexicans did was that um even with the cocaine i was told
that like still 70 of their profits was marijuana and so they really didn't like um all this home
grown in the west coast sort of taking their taking their you know their their sales really
well and so they started sending these teams all from down by where matt is all the way up to the
oregon border and going in the national forests and just growing a huge amount as much as they
could get away with in all the national forests so that way they didn't have to smuggle it over
the border yeah you know and that's that was kind of so there's been this obviously this like that's
what i was saying before about like how one one country influences the other is the homegrown
movement has dramatically changed how the how the mexicans approach growing weed because you know
for a long time they were sort of the primary weed people yeah yeah yeah for sure especially
in arizona with the border here um tucson was like the capital of smugglers and and dealers and
then it moved up to phoenix and tempe and scottsdale but they they busted a big row in
the canyon next to us just 10 15 years ago and it was a gang from from mexico operating out of phoenix
and they had a spring that they had found up on the side of this mountain and they had a system of
drip irrigation that ran a mile down the canyon yeah they just went too big these guys they just
didn't even think about hunters and ranchers and they just threw a team at it group all this stuff
and then they all got busted yeah i mean to some degree on a spring on a hillside model that's
that's the way it was done in norcal when i was out there that summer i'm sure you've seen lots of
that right i mean the i think the cartels kind of had a uh they viewed their a lot of their workers
as semi-disposable and so they sort of expected a certain amount to get in trouble and they just
threw a lot of people out there in a lot of different regions and they figured most of
them will be successful and some of them won't yeah and that's kind of how they went about it i
think just a numbers game yeah i mean they had money but you know when the power when the powder
came in you know i think a lot of that colombian uh import just disappeared stopped entirely yeah
and the mexican commercial became they probably filled the gap for that for that uh tier of
quality product quality around the country i can tell you that um you know i mean i started smoking
in the 90s there was brown mexican and green mexican i didn't see thai i didn't see colombian
i didn't see panamanian i didn't see any of those of those famous things that people wax poetic about
it was mexican yeah i saw movies and i'm a decade later and all i saw was mexican too you know it's
just never i never saw thai never saw anything other than just mexican yeah yeah it was gone
okay so we got a little bit into mexico just just a hair do you want to go more into that is there
some more details you want to add in there not really it's just rubbing shoulders with these
famous people was kind of weird i didn't know who they were at the time they were just um guys
exporting weed from guadalajara area but then when we found out it was miguel angel um and
garo we were like whoa shit man yeah i bet we i'm so glad we didn't get sucked into the cocaine deal
because the this guy who who was a truck driver he could fly helicopters he could fly planes he
he went that direction and he sold 10 kilos to an undercover agent north of phoenix in the biggest
hand to hand sale by in arizona history at the time and he got i think it was seven kilos and
he got 10 years in prison jesus but his brother kept going and did those loads on our air our
airstrip that we found um and they got nine of them before they got busted and we calculated at
the price of coke at the time that it was it came to around a quarter billion dollars whoa
million dollars of coke that they successfully brought in before they got busted and i have no
idea what happened to those boys boy jeez yeah risalda blanco i had never heard her name until
i read about it in newsweek or time but that's who my colombian friend was actually working for
and his job was to count money and he would go to aspen where they bring in dc9s or something
of like six tons at a time of colombian and he would just his fingers he could barely move them
after a week because they didn't have machines yet then jeez i can imagine hand counting five
million dollars you know in twenties and tens and that's where the stories started happening
about how they weighed their their money because in florida he went to a apartment building once
and he said there'd be like five apartments and they'd have a secret door in the closet that
would link it to the next apartment and to the next apartment so that if they had to bail they
could just disappear yeah and he went into one apartment and he said it was florida ceiling
with tiny passageways in the hallways of just money piled florida ceiling every single room
and he said there was millions of millions of dollars and and that was one of the kind of
places where they would just weigh money yeah wait you know and then send it back to colombia
that's so wild and the responsibility of being the dude who has to count it because like you
get that shit wrong you're gonna be the first person they look at right not me yeah might be
making friends in brooklyn the guy who's in charge he goes by the nickname sata he overpaid us once
two thousand dollars and i know him and he did it as a trick to see if we were going to tell him
and be honest oh interesting we counted the money a second time and i i said in his house in brownsville
and i said you know sada you're over by two thousand dollars singles what no no not even
possible and he was just messing with us because he wanted this we were it was early in our
relationship and he wanted to see if we were honest enough and we passed we passed the test so
that was good yeah that's a good thing yeah i used to do that with my spray like my reversal spray
i'd give it to different people and you know give them different like yeah you know for this
exchange or this exchange and i knowing mostly that i was never going to get anything but just
kind of get a good gauge of who is going to just take it run with it use it to make themselves a
bunch of money or who would do you know what they said it's a good way i mean it's it's a small loss
but it's a good way to judge a potential future lifelong friend too yeah cheap way to to
figure out who you can trust absolutely and to them and to the other person it's almost like
from a greedy person's angle it's like well this one bottle could potentially make me you know
several thousand dollars worth of feminized seed so is it worth the burn you know and a lot of
times it is worth the burn to people yeah magic magic always says if there is a doubt
that about a person then there is no doubt it's a good quote that's a line from the movie um
ronin and running yep and um he says if there's a doubt there is no doubt and yeah it's near the
end of the movie and that's when you find out that he never quit and he was still working for the
cia or something yeah robert de niro right classical movie but it's true it if you i treat
my life that way if i have a doubt about something i just go i'll wait and see what the universe
does i i didn't do that when i was younger you see i would jump in with both feet you know
you seem to have a very magical touched life though i mean a lot of people you know only live
a fraction or see a fraction of what what you uh managed to get yourself wound up in time and time
again and and the fact is you guys weren't outlaws as far as carrying guns and being cowboys and
stuff like that you carried this very humble uh attitude yeah i had a great big throwing knife
on my hip when i was going to the canyon and you know i don't know what good that would do
um but we we specifically didn't we knew other people some of the guys from jerome they are all
heavily armed and they would have barbed wire in the bushes and weird stuff you read about this in
magazines and yeah and i was just going that's that makes them instantly um dangerous criminals
yeah we were just hippies i dangerous criminals that's an important distinction to make because
i think uh we've chatted for long enough now that i can safely say that everybody on on this uh
this little this little call that we're doing is is a weed nerd you know yeah in that regard and
so for me um having been in a bunch of counterculture kind of my whole life i totally differentiate
between like people who do certain substances but are otherwise like honorable and very good people
it's just some of the things they decided to get into happen to not be societally acceptable
right right then people that are like actual criminals you know where it's and there's a big
difference there because there's a lot of people that are wonderful people um and the only thing
that they do wrong really that could get them into significant trouble is marijuana yeah you know and
and i was when i was listening to you guys talk about some of the the the transition into powders
and stuff like that one of the things that i've always thought about is that like the weed game
or the weed scene is inherently just like less dangerous than that other world like when that
other world started happening maybe it's because of the way it makes people think or the way people
act or the money was so much bigger but it seemed to bring out a lot of like negative qualities in
people that when you were in the weed game existed but maybe weren't like maybe weren't like accented
quite so much right you know yep well my friends in brooklyn they would oh sato would open the door
he'd have a mac 9 in his hand you know and he'd look around and make sure it was cool to let us in
but they had they had plenty of weapons but my friend ricky who he's still my friend i see him
when i go to new york he lives in brooklyn in the same apartment since 74 he uh never ever had a gun
the other rastas did and but he was he's a philosopher he's a real gentle guy um he's a
good brother of mine i've known him 40 years now and he uh he's wonderful i go have curry goat with
him whenever we're there he takes me to a different restaurant i love curry goat and
aki and saltfish they have in these those caribbean neighborhoods you know you can still
get all that the restaurants um they cater to the people who live there so it's very cool i love that
stuff i would say too like for mendocino county there's definitely people that have guns that had
the intention on using them you know if they were accosted by other humans but there was a lot of
growers that had guns on them simply because they were in some remote ass spot on the hill and if
they came across a bear with cubs or a mountain lion they didn't want to just die right they wanted
to have a fighting chance so there was there was this idea of i'm alone in the deep woods by myself
and this is not my territory and there's bear and mountain lion and other things that
that uh i'm a lot weaker than even jaguars yeah even jaguars yeah i mean even that i mean mountain
lions this you know bears usually here um mountain lions they they've been watching you for a while
if you ever even know that they're there you know um but we would encounter all that that
kind of stuff like a lot of times all of a sudden something would go wrong with our water
and we'd have to walk the water line back to like the the cat you know the the spring box that we
had made or something right and you're walking through deep woods totally alone you know and
you're in the deep woods and you know you don't have teeth or claws and you're not super strong
so some people would have pistols or shotguns or something just to make themselves feel okay
when they're out there and sticks yeah dual dual dobermans is is popular with some people i knew
yeah they had two dobermans and they were you know they went wherever they went they had their
dobermans and one's name was tor and the other one was tia tortilla i know this one guy and you know
they they were not quite command dogs but they were close you would tell them to do something
and they would just do it yeah so and they'd sniff out a bear or a bear would you know
better let your dogs fight the bear than you i mean in my era too it became uncomfortable because
um the penalty for getting caught with a gun at a at a row was actually like quite a bit worse than
the grow itself yeah then it was kind of like a do you risk it even because even if even if you
were going to beat the case on a medical thing or something like that later on with the grow they'd
be like oh no he's a hardened criminal armed right he was ready to hurt people and we caught him
you know that's what this is from that humbled article and they're they're pointing out this
machine gun yeah it says humble deputies sees this menacing array of weaponry including an
uzi and an ak-47 along with marijuana in raids on growers you know they love to point those out and
make everybody think that that's what most growers are doing they do absolutely they do and some
people sadly i mean when wherever there's profit involved uh people get into it for different
reasons yeah you know and and some of the people involved certainly were that i wouldn't classify
it as the majority but certainly a percentage you know yep humans are humans i didn't feel
real comfortable in wallahari to tell you the truth because everyone was packing in those the
guys carrying the beer were packing i don't know just they that's their job they took us out to
sushi in wallahari and it was some of the best sushi i've ever had in my life and they um they
were it was a lieutenant of miguel's he went by the name of wapo which means handsome and they
took us out and it was amazing because the guy who ran it he'd speak in japanese to his crew
then he turned to us and speak in english perfectly and then he turned and talked to
these guys in spanish it was quite quite amazing yeah doesn't doesn't fit in with the stereotype of
the dump of the the dumb stoner right no no oh i mean i think americans are uh we're very we're
very isolated because we've got uh canadians who also speak english for the most part besides the
people in quebec uh above us um and we've got two oceans next to us but i think a lot of parts of
the world are multilingual just because they encounter so many different languages as part
of their daily life and in america we are we're kind of broken from that in a bit you know my
swiss family speaks five languages perfectly yeah i have an aunt who's swiss and she speaks four
you know and and and so much so yes very much so and i i actually kind of regret that because i
think the lung the younger you learn language the more fluent and fluid you are in in speaking and
reading it um and i think americans a lot of times like uh it does something to your brain to be able
to speak multiple languages and communicate you know i i think it's super cool um yeah so we have
the the story of the peyote prince can you briefly or even maybe not even briefly can you
tell us what a peyote prince is um one of their they're both i don't know how they came into this
but they both knew sam and sam was a road chief in the native american church on the navajo reservation
and he had a license that allowed him to go to northern mexico across the border from texas
and he'd come back with a quarter million or a half a million of peyote buttons yeah for the church
where actually 90 of it wasn't going to the church it was going to these two guys
yeah and they would one lived in tempe two blocks from the police station and the other one
lived in cottonwood arizona and um that's where i lived at the time
and these were fresh buttons so they had to dry them so the guy in tempe had date
date racks that they dry dates in and it was perfect for peyote and if you went into his
little old house in tempe you had to turn sideways to go down the hallways or go into any room
in this case that wasn't stacks of money it was just stacks of date trays
drying 200 000 buttons and once they dried as you've if you've seen them they look like little
flat discs and almost like jerky you know like a little piece of jerky
but don't be fooled but until you taste it and they would just sell
this was 1973 when i was first in arizona and um you could get them as low as a nickel a button
if you bought a certain amount yeah and then you could sell them for a quarter so in illinois
in cago all over the united states these two guys had friends who who would come to arizona
and get them i don't think they shipped in ups or in the mail people always took them one of my
friends gave a guy 200 and he was going through custom or through the gate to go to his air
his flight this was about 1980 i'm thinking in phoenix or maybe it was 78 somewhere in there
and he looked back to see his friend leaving and one of the security guys was holding the bag of
peyote up in the air and looking at it and and but and he asked him what are these and he said
they're peyote's they're um cactus seeds and the guy looked at him oh okay and he gave it back to
him they they didn't even have it wasn't even in their radar and their training yet yeah at that
point sure the princes were amazing i know both of them still they're still both alive and one of
them isn't as healthy as the other but they were you know it was just a an amazing thing that
millions and millions of buttons they sold and some of them were diverted to redway
to the guy there two of my friends would drive 50 to 70 000 buttons to up to northern california
and they would get turned into mescaline sulfate pure wow and mescaline is only like 40 percent
i think is some number like that of the alkaloids in a peyote that's the one that everyone knows
then they even call it mescaline you know or whatever but there's many other alkaloids that
are significant in a peyote journey but when you extract just the mescaline sulfate
then it's a different journey and i always i did them both and i i compared it to
the mescaline sulfate was like peyote without the teacher because we take peyote or experience it
there's this inner voice um it's it's hard to describe but you it seems like it's someone else
but it's you actually it's your inner consciousness you're hearing your thoughts in a way that it
sounds like it's an external voice wow yeah i've never done peyote it's it's let me i'm terrified
of throwing up so well let me let me interject something here my um my experience with peyote
is probably a lot less than yours but i will say that the buttons were some of the more bitter
things that i ever intentionally swallowed in my life um so i can see how the mescaline pills
might might go down a little smoother for some people because you really have to be like okay
this is going to be good for me because they don't taste good it's not as bitter as wormwood
but it's right up there it's pretty intense bitter i i mean i remember that was that's my
strongest memory of trying to consume them was like man yeah um yeah there was people doing
peyote elements to avoid it going into their gut that was big in the area i lived in mostly
a couple ladies not so many trying to get me to do that yeah they would make tea and then just
q and m and then you would have this wonderful trip and you never throw up you don't get any
discomfort because you skip your gut your stuff yeah i mean like i'm i've i've done uh ayahuasca
in brazil all the time good lord i do not but i um but i will say that when you when you are
like you know meeting your creator or whatever and you're and you're super fired up um having
your stomach hurt and having to purge any which way you have to purge is pretty intense yeah and
i remember when i did it in brazil i had to run out and i had to do it i had to uh get rid of
some things out outside of myself in the jungle and i really wanted a bright american clean bathroom
because i felt so exposed just like running in the dark and and uh and all that experience of
other people yeah south america very intense and you know peyote it doesn't it doesn't feel good
digesting some of those alkaloids you were discussing your body is not ready to digest
them comfortably yeah so sometimes chocolate mescaline and the stuff that was being sold
on the hill and boulder was not mescaline um even at the low price of five or six or eight cents a
button when this was being made by that that um wizard chemist in northern california it it
enough to get you high would cost you ten dollars so these one and two dollar hits of chocolate
mescaline were just um lsd yeah oh wow powder mixed in because unless you paid her 10 15 dollars
and the crystals must have been perfect there's photos on my on one of my um chronicles they look
like pickup sticks about an inch long sharp needles if you poured them out of a bottle they
would just pile up in these sharp needle looks and they'd have to be crushed into a powder to
put them in a cap we um just ate some of the crystals once and but the guy who said you know
if you're measuring this out a good trip would be 10 to 15 dollars so very few people have
actually even seen or done mescaline sulfate this is the point i i agree with you i would even say
in my era when i was experimenting with that stuff it's almost all relabeled lsd um you know it just
was yep uh it most people haven't experienced it because the the buttons are hard to come by and
taste gross um and and people are just marketing to a different thing so they're like oh yeah here's
some mescaline but it um there was some really good advice you gave in one of your stories uh
bad jack about juicing but can you talk about that a little bit well the last time i did coyote i
juiced 50 buttons fresh buttons and i had a lot yes yes tennis if you eat 10 fresh buttons if you
could get those down you will have a really strong journey oh wow we took 50 and juice them and i had
a quart bottle of beautiful emerald green liquid and my friend who is the tall fellow my first
girl partner he drank a third of the bottle and i drank two thirds of the bottle and he spent the
whole night face down on his sleeping bag um he never moved for like 10 hours and i would ask him
a question and he wouldn't answer and then about three or four minutes later he'd go no or it was
a time lag it was really funny and i had a fire going and i was saying let's go for a hike let's
do this and he just he was immobilized um but he had a good when he woke up in the morning he said
i had the strangest dreams so he did enjoy it though like the if you ever see the movie young
guns with estavez and all those young kids stars that were there's a scene in there where they eat
peyote yeah and they're the one guy shooting his gun wildly out at this mining claim and
and the what other guy is talking and you hear his voice but he's not talking and whoever produced
that movie has done peyote because they knew about the voice it's so clear in that scene i i was just
amazed that someone had um or they had a technical advisor that knew that that's how they would do it
because he was stumbling around and you could hear this voice talking to him yeah it was good
i man has tried to get me to talk about psychedelics on the show and i've kind of
kept it weed focused but i will say that sometimes when when things get very intense
you're kind of locked in your own mind like if your friend was laying down what they're experiencing
and feeling and thinking and is so intense you just lose track of the fact that you have legs
and arms and you can't really interact with the world because you have so much sensory data that's
coming into your brain and you're thinking about so many things that like all that other stuff is
extraneous to some degree you know and that that's common i've seen that on mushrooms on lsd on high
doses of different things where you just end up kind of in your own head you know it's not a very
physical thing it's a very inward thing yeah you know and so sometimes that's good and sometimes
that's bad but it usually is is is positive long term you know as long as you got a safe space and
you're with friends yep set and setting is everything yeah and i think i think for uh
episode three we might adventure maybe if you're open to it maybe make that more of the um full
expansive psychological uh psychedelic aspect of your life the spiritual journey that that
has brought mad jag to this point because we're butting up against the end and i know like for
those who are watching this we recorded this around right around christmas time everybody's kind of
squeezing in hours to get them in so i i also wanted to to really thank you guys for spending
your time with us and every everyone in the audience on on christmas so um yeah it's an
honor man and a pleasure and i'm so glad that we um i was able to convince rajo to um join in the
way he has because uh i met him for the first time last year i've been we've been face-to-face
yeah face-to-face but we've been friends for since around 2012 on the forums and
it was just a gas to meet him and oh i bet i'm glad and to see him sit with people talking about
strains and varieties there is only one other person a guy who goes by the name satva who's
in boulder who's can tell you about 30 different types of columbian and he's been growing columbian
in boulder for like 30 years oh man like 10 different punta roja strains i mean he and he
goes to these places he's he his wife speaks fluent spanish he speaks some and they go down to
guerrero a lot along the coast in little towns you can only get to by boat oh wow yeah and he's
posting some photos and yeah he's he was amazing he did join us too i i can yeah i can say from my
perspective that first matt will tell you it takes a lot to shut me up and i try to talk as little as
possible but i burn with questions almost every third sentence that you or rajo talk about and i
try to afterwards write down various questions and ideas that i have and so it's really cool
that we're having like this multi-stage thing because an hour or two after we do these things
i get i'm like oh my god why didn't i i want to follow up on that so bad i gotta remember
you know because there's this off-handed comment and you know conversations go in different
directions and you don't always get to follow up on stuff um and we like free flowing but
uh there's a wealth there's a wealth of uh of of information and just enjoyable convo here so i'm
i'm super stoked well remember this for next time pay phones and quarters pay phones and quarters
it is and quarters because that's how we had to communicate i'd call my phone oh yeah that's
that was my that was my if we ever talk about the psychedelic aspect that was my era pay phones and
quarters do you know what a chinger is yeah yeah it's a black box it's to make it yeah so what we
did when we were on dead tour is we someone discovered that when you put quarters into a
pay phone the pay the pay the company actually knows what coin you're putting in by the tone
right so a dime is one tone a nickel is one tone a quarter is one tone somebody got the clever idea
that you could get these little recorders from radio shack that recorded about 30 seconds
and you could record them and you could just push in quarters into the thing and record
right and then when you go to make a long distance call yep you know you we would so we would use pay
phones and and all these different things and like you know tell each other where we were going to be
at what time of day and what hour and call us not as a boomer he calls them chingers us us young men
calling black boxes you hold it up to the mouthpiece of the phone and hit play and it would
make the sound of the coins falling into the machine right and eventually eventually the phone
company caught on to it and you would get an operator going sir hello hello yeah and you would
have to bail but um you know yeah it uh that was that was before cell phones and when pay phones
were everywhere nine dollars and ninety cents for three minutes to cali columbia from in 1982
and the operators were going what and you know i yeah it was i used a lot of quarters but my friend
in manhattan one of the three brothers of the weed people he would buy a thousand dollars worth at a
time at a bank and he had a cart and he'd bring them out he'd load up his car and whenever he'd
go out he just put like 10 rolls in his pockets because you know never know how many phone calls
you're gonna have to make and how long because he was always calling to different states um yeah
pay phones wow yeah yeah uh it was a little spy versus spy on that level they were safer
you know they were safer especially if you rotated and didn't use the same ones all the time
it always sucked following not so though after a pay phone because they're just so sticky i just
cannot deal with that man indeed see he's got two in this episode he didn't get one last time so he's
bummed it's really practically three with the whole boofing thing yeah yeah i'm glad someone
remembered that one and all you know especially messages at the bottom we're at almost two hours
here yeah so matt if you want to plug anything and um and we'll keep we'll keep this thing going
i mean there's a lot of paths we can go down yep and uh we still only scratch the surface on some
of it yeah i mean we made it to map one 1979 so i think yeah next round we're gonna go to 1980 map
and then continue on um we have our merch up go check out syndicategear.com um you guys raho
anything uh you know this was a great episode i like we kind of focused on mad jag stuff and
you know if we maybe we can organize or you know get a little bit of a game plan to limit or focus
discussions that way we won't spin off so much we'll be able to drill down um on the upcoming
ones but um now you know maybe with all this discussion about old mexicans i'd maybe give a
shout out to one of my boys cryptic labs who has a great reputation for his walking lines that
