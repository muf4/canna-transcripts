second verse same as the first see if it works this time I don't know don't know
what the fuck happened it just shut down my live feed all the
sudden so we'll see we'll try it again and see if when not so joins us and we
might have to switch to the other account I don't know what's going on
let's see hey it worked we got the boot yeah I got the boot it was real fucking
weird so we'll see if it happens again I don't know what happened I'm just too
pretty for this shit sometimes I think it's probably what's happening indeed
yeah indeed so I'm gonna do a giveaway at some point tonight and we'll have to
figure out how to run it but I'll probably leave that up to you because
it's much easier to put it off on you to figure out how to do the giveaway to
figure it out indeed yeah all right we already got 114 116 something like that
so whenever you want to kick it off we can I mean the funniest thing is because
I have to do that because I do this shit on my phone yeah like if I sit back this
far right yeah I can't see any other comments you also could potentially be
getting a blowjob off-camera it could happen I suppose but then they you know
they did but it's so then if I want to see what people are saying then I have
to make my head like take the whole frame you know it is what it is on it it
is what it is so we have blue bonnet available Uncle Brizzy it's on a right
seat co.com so yeah I guess we are getting we are getting up there yeah or
whatever so do you know actually I I don't even know why this stuck in my
head but I can't remember what it's called because it's Russian and I have
terrible pronunciation yeah but they used to do they used to do this gambling
thing we're like there's a bunch of dudes sitting around like a huge table
right and there's like one chick underneath giving head to someone uh-huh
and you have to figure out who it is and if they can tell you're getting it you
lose a bunch of money so there's all these dudes with their pants off and they
have to sit there like all stoic yeah I know I think that's bad I'm the one under
the table oh yeah like balls indeed it's it's a trust situation it's a trust
situation yeah you know I often speaking of Russian I often refer to when you go
to expel a fart and you're not sure if it's fully loaded and you're gonna have
some blowback I call I refer to that as Russian roulette Russian roulette yeah I
hope I know if the chamber's loaded I hope that I I make it to old age where
I'm not worried about that that's just not a worry yeah not everyone has the
same worries you know I have I have that worry at this age so you get no good
you get a unique collection of worries that are just yours you know they might
not pertain to everyone else so you know anyway yeah we got enough people here we
can start or whatever thank you everybody for joining again on Friday
kind of like a little collection of stuff we were going to talk about
tonight it came up on our on our our discord this week like some breeding
expectations and just seeing what people commented about breeders today versus
breeders yesterday or of yesteryear we figured like we could chat a bit about
like even what people expected yeah like what expectations were and how
expectations like have always sort of shaped what breeders do yeah even from
the beginning right and then we had a comment come in that I thought was kind
of interesting that like could sort of tie into that which is like people
wanted us to talk about beasters oh really beasters indeed which we
actually have some we actually have some good friends that could talk a lot more
eloquently probably than we could on it but what I thought was in could be
interesting is we could talk for a bit about like how it affected America yeah
like how to change things here how it changed the homegrown scene here how it
you know just certain aspects of it right so I don't know we we could start
we could start any any which way because I guess I guess maybe two beasters would
be sort of like the the first like commercialization of kind but yeah yeah
right yeah because everybody else was getting it usually from some there
wasn't really commercial scenes then sure no and and you couldn't really call
Mexican brick beasters necessarily no there was a commercial Mexican obviously
that had been commercialized for a long time yeah but like there was a situation
in most parts of the country even in the west coast where there wasn't enough
good kind but yeah I never even got a whiff of BC beasters ever in my life
never saw them they didn't make it down all the way down to Bakersfield or San
Diego so I never saw any of that stuff I mean it it permeated all over the place
especially the East Coast yeah I bet you know and it had it had different effects
strangely enough in different places I guess I'll start talking about this
because we're already into it but like so you take beasters and somewhere like
the southeast right or certain like that that might be the only non-Mexican bud
you could get yeah like it might have been all and like what people don't get
is like in the 90s and stuff like that you know it was still super prohibited
right yeah and they you know so it kept it really small there was way more
demand than there was supply right and that's kind of what made everything easy
to sell because you could always always sell whatever because it like it so I
mean for example in a place we have here called Cottonwood it a type of weed was
going around called made that was old commercial not I mean but Mexican brick
sprayed with raid and they'd call it made and that was a thing and they could
sell that and move that you know anything could be will be some guy all
upset like he's like fuck beasters we got fire here on the southeast I mean
the era that we're talking about is the 90s and so there wasn't enough fire
anywhere yeah like fire was hard to get and you know and people had it but and
fires relative fires relative and for like part of the reason why and people
someone even asked I'm 22 what are beasters beasters literally is indoor
indoor weed grown in Canada and shipped to America yeah at scale right that was
in the 90s and into the into the early 2000s right and so people think people
laugh at it now but the reason why it was so successful was because for most
people I mean you know your access was like green Mexican brown Mexican oh you
know or like you had a buddy who had a buddy who had a buddy who maybe every
once in a while could get you a quarter a kind of yeah and so beasters filled
that void you know and now it's like you say the word beasters and people have
all kinds of comments they're making right now but in the beginning none of
that was no yeah right like it was like so in a lot of parts of the country it
was the only it was the only kind bud regularly available right and even in
California California it fucked us up right because and it asked in a way I
actually feel like it it sort of started the purple wave in California I almost
yeah I almost I I think it had a big play a big part of how so what happened
is is that back then you know most indoor or most outdoor or whatever even
outdoor and stuff there wasn't a tons of depth there wasn't tons of outdoor and
stuff like that most people were growing were growing pounds and the in the
dozens of pounds not the hundreds of pounds yeah outside and then most
indoors were like you know four to twelve lights or something right yeah
and so you know there was an aspect where all that stuff was expensive yeah
okay and so people so you know what brokers are like right yeah so you have
this choice where you can come to Mendo and you can get a bunch of fireweed for
like 42 yeah right or you can talk to these Canadians and you can get a bunch
of beasters for 23 yeah right so what are the brokers gonna do yeah
nine times out of ten pick cheap so nine times out of ten they're gonna pick
cheap right and so and they're gonna make a hell of a margin you know and so
what happened is is that there was a in California there was good weed to be
smoked but what the brokers tried to do which is what they tried to do forever
is like it's no different than like can I make these depths look like ends yeah
are these outs good enough to look like depths are they good enough to look like
something better than they are because then I can make the profit difference
between like what those sell for and what these sell for yeah so in like you
know in you know a lot of parts of the country beasters was all there was so it
was like fuck you take it yeah I mean if one dude was the only plug in town and
he decides to take beasters over some kind bud then you're just gonna get smoke
beasters and that's that yeah or you're gonna buy Mexican yeah exactly those are
those are your issues right so but then in California they had to pass it off a
lot of times as homegrown yeah because other California people were edgy at the
West Coast and Oregon and stuff in Washington they knew enough that like
they weren't gonna pay that kind of pricing for it yeah because they had
other options they could find somebody that had homegrown yeah so then the
middlemen tried to make beasters look like homegrown sure right and it worked
for a time because everybody's commenting right now and I see all of
you right and now it's pretty well known that a lot of beasters were grown like
too much salts they were harvested a little early they weren't cured as nicely
as they should have been they were packaged in and seal a meal airtight
containers and zipped close yeah and then by the time that they got to where
they were going they had suffered a quality issue yeah it wasn't as nice as
it was where it began right like sometimes it could smell like hey
sometimes it could smell a little a little a little weird a little off a
little yeah people saying PGR's but at the time people didn't know most of that
it was like you could either get Mexican or this yeah that was or like you had
you had you were a lucky enough person that you grew or you knew someone close
to you that grew right yeah that you could get some eighths or some quarters
or a zip every two or three months and you know there's also Mexicans that
would come up that were like almost like a red hue and that was a let's see a lot
of people using the word for tendica we didn't really use that because we didn't
get the BC beasters but our pretend it was the uncompressed Mexican that would
come down you know what Chicago for tendica was no so Chicago pretend IKA
was in the Midwest there's a ton of ditch weed yeah right and ditch weed is
basically like leftover wild hemp from World War two hemp for victory thing
right yes well some of that can look beautiful so sometimes entrepreneurs
would go out there and and get a bunch of pounds of gorgeous looking hemp yeah
and dry it nice and they'd sell $300 ounces of weed that looked incredible
but you couldn't get high off it and I didn't even know what CBD was back then
you know I never it just didn't I I just was shocked because my green Mexican
got me higher yeah I always thought that was weird because the uncompressed brick
almost always you'd get higher off the fucking shittier high compressed brick
so almost always so there was a weird thing so what happened what I mean and
this is a roundabout way of saying it so sorry for everybody but what I think
happened in California is that you had this thing where like they were flooding
the west coast with all this indoor yeah right and so all these brokers are
moving this indoor from kick from Canada and they're taking the margin convincing
people it's it's California or it's Oregon or whatever you know it's
Washington it's homegrown and then eventually people started noticing the
differences they started looking for the rock-hard PGR buds they started looking
for certain noses sometimes they started looking even for like the way it was
seal amealed you know like people would get it and they would cut open all the
seal ameals and they would put it into turkey bags oh yeah yeah in order to
like make it seem like it wasn't from where it was from you know yeah and and
you know and so what happened is is that you've got all these brokers trying to
pass off weed that they bought for 22 2300 bucks yeah into the force and
you're trying to actually find some of that actual cap Cali in homegrown yeah
right and so when the ERC and the and the Mendo P and the granddaddy and all
that started selling in the bay and going for it there wasn't a bunch of
Canadian weed that looked purple yeah no that now I get what you're saying so you
could see it right they would see it they would send up all these people to
Humboldt and Mendo and it's different spots and grab as much purpose they took
because it was an easier hustle for them because everyone they gave it to they
knew they weren't getting bunked with some fake beasters yeah and then what
says once that toehold took place in at least in NorCal once that toehold took
place then it was just like a self-sustaining thing yeah right and all
the brokers couldn't pass off beast as homegrown yeah because everybody wanted
like one of these half a dozen purple strains and you could sell endless
amounts of those I remember growing some of the Canadian purples and there yeah
there's no way they could be passed off as indoor anything I remember that most
of them had to be grown outdoor in the first place and they were just very
loose purple sometimes but not very not very grand I just think it was one of
those things that it just it just like made it distinctive I mean there was a
time to were like the with the early dispensaries and stuff like that part of
the reason why the dispensaries could move endless amounts of perps was
because all their customers knew that the dispensary wasn't buying cheap beast
and flipping it for the high they were just buying fucking Mendo perps and
flipping it because it won't get you hot well yeah I mean it's not so much
that dude it's like because you know everybody's affected differently but
sure the Canadian weed because it wasn't dried as nicely as we like to do it oh
yeah I'm sure and then it was it was it was you know and then once you seal
something up for a few weeks wet what you know it's gonna ferment yeah that's
me nice and then it's gonna be compressed lightly so like cuz any kind
of smuggling is all about shipping it's all about volume and space right sure so
you get this weed that like is like it probably if it would have stayed where
it was gonna stay and got dried really nicely probably would have been better
yeah you know but then you you harvest it a little early you don't flush it you
package it a little too moist you put it into an airtight thing and you scrunch
it down on itself you know uh you know they uh and so that and so then there
was occasionally some really nice beasters you know there was there was
some really good weed that came out of there but just the over the overall
flood was pretty lowbrow yeah the overall flood was pretty low bow but for
a lot of places people think of now right where it's like the West Coast is
just sending you know people joke on IG for years about how the West Coast just
sends all their bunk east yeah right and it's like a running joke because of how
much work that gets grown in on the West Coast of America would get sent to
other parts of America yeah but in the 90s there wasn't a flood like that yeah
there wasn't a flood going east at all I was just teasing about Mendo perps guys
it's just a lot of people always say it doesn't get them high no I mean
Mendo I'm not it's it's there's very few strains that that have everything yeah
unbelievable look it has an unbelievable set of turps it breeds really well it
does all this this cool stuff but because it's so old it's low THC yeah
you know it is and so you know like one of our buddy you know Caleb I mean one
of his better crosses of it is to the the bubble yeah you know right and
there's a Obama Kush or whatnot you know cuz the Bubba adds frost and density and
some potency and the Mendo adds color and turps and shit you know yeah and so
you know and then different people like I I actually like if I smoke Mendo pee
in the morning like it actually makes me creative rather than couch lock yeah
that's a good so if I like wake up and drink some coffee and eat some food and
I smoke some Mendo pee and I start writing down my list of shit I want to
accomplish yeah like I my brain works at a pretty good level yeah I think I was
soured up in the morning and then I usually am asleep right after writing
that little note of things to do I mean it's there for the future at least yeah
it is there for tonight but so like for so basically like Beasters too it's like
we're not gonna do a whole show on it but Beasters affected different parts of
the country in different ways yeah right in California it really did kind of
spark the purple wave because people didn't want to get stuck with Beasters
but in other parts of the country there wasn't that much choice like my buddies
and this is what this is what's crazy is that so my friends in Chicago that
stayed there obviously when I moved west okay yeah you know how for a lot of
people Beasters dropped the price of what they were able to get to some
degree it affected price points in California right well in Chicago it made
their prices go up yeah because they were like well this if this goes for
four then my shit six you know yeah and they actually flipped it and they did
better because of it because their homegrown was their home there's super
nice indoor homegrown was so much danker yeah they were like well if this is what
you can get this for then ours has to be that yeah so it literally like their
stuff before Biester went for about what Biester did yeah and then when it came
in it like created another grade of kind bud that their bud was obviously better
smart marketing you know and so it went up but in California it hurt us yeah
because it was like the first flood of cheap fucking indoor it's crazy that it
didn't affect SoCal very much at all like it just didn't hit down here like
that I mean up north yeah well there's parts of it I don't even know if I
should say but because there's like there is because like you know I was
talking about like just like the weed impact of it but there was obviously
like some big groups involved a lot of money at stake and a lot of smoke and
you know there was there's aspects to it that you know and it got really
honestly the other thing that we should say is that you know in the 90s and 2000
and 2001 you know America did not spend very much energy worrying about the
Canadians yeah not at all our border with the Canadians especially was super
porous yeah right and there was a lot of independence there was a lot of guys
like with friends on snowmobiles with you know with duffel duffel bags and
there was all kinds of crazy shit going on in terms of getting stuff from Canada
to here did you ever see that movie kid cannabis yeah yeah that kid was one of
those dudes I've talked to one of the dudes it was involved in it before so
you know it was coming over and truckloads it was coming over you know
but in a lot of places you can just go to the border and meet up with an
American on the other side of the border yeah it was all kinds of shit like that
going on right and then the fucking Al Qaeda crashed the planes into New York
and flying became a lot rougher and they started paying a lot more attention and
heat sensors and all that to the board and the northern Canadian border not
because they were worried about Canucks selling weed in America but mostly
because they were worried about you know terrorists sneaking in through Canada
don't they tell you yeah it just I mean I get it you know it's like so they
tighten the shit up yeah and then a lot of the ways that and so in late 2001 a
lot of the ways that people used to move it across the border whether it was
snowmobiles or mountain bikes or you know just driving close and hiking it
over and dropping it in the woods and having the Americans come get it you
know all that yeah all of a sudden you know because we put all of our money for
the most part we put the vast majority of our money into policing the southern
border yeah because there was just a fuck ton of heroin and cocaine and weed
issues and you know all that and so the Canadians we just weren't too we just
weren't too intense on that and so you know the and they didn't even know that
there was that much weed happening either yeah so there's an invisibility
factor to something for a minute right and and so then they locked all that
shit down and they made it a lot harder yeah they made it a lot harder for like
independence to get it across the border so then it moved to like trucking and
various aspects and smuggling and then what kind of groups does that bring in
yeah of course a lot bigger groups than just some like independent dude wanting
to work or whatever then that brings in organized groups organized groups of
various kinds traditional organized groups various kinds of organized groups
that existed up there which is easy to go and read about if you if you so
choose and then like the independence all felt squeezed yeah because they were
all hiding from like these other groups that wanted to control everything right
yep and you know and then it really and the reason why that all worked was
because there wasn't there wasn't enough like people people you know downgrade oh
you know California or Oregon or whatever sends all their booth east but
like there wasn't you know I had friends that would drive a bunch of work back
east back in the day you know and like there wasn't anybody there was almost
nobody on the road doing yeah it was rare there was a there wasn't that much
excess yeah especially in the 90s with all the helicopters and all the air and
how much you could get away with doing or whatever it was like we could you
know California kind of served California in the West yeah and it
really wasn't until 215 and a bunch of other groups got in and things started
expanding on a large level that those waves just started going everywhere yeah
and that ended up basically doing two things that like it it changed the
margins for both the Canadians and the Mexicans yeah because that that
convergence of all that weed getting sent in you know they talk about it now
it's like Mexicans send like 70 80% less weed into America than they used to oh I
bet yeah right and then that's fucked up for us too okay because those guys
are you know they're criminals you know trying to make money yeah so then
they've got to replicate that lost revenue oh yeah and all the things that
they've decided to like replicate that lost revenue with are all way worse than
brown weed oh yeah no man that's the big one well meth
fentanyl you know kidnapping yeah all trapped like coyotes moving human
trafficking like yeah I mean they a lot of those cartels they would make 60 70
percent of their income off of wheat yeah so then the way different now yeah
so then two-thirds of that slows down that's a lot of loot yep you know it
really is and then you know same thing with the Canadians the Canadians were
sending a ton of that down and the Mexicans were sending a ton of it north
to like the voracious appetite of America to smoke weed and then the West
Coast of America started supplying Americans with American weed yeah and
it's sort of like shaved off the top and the bottom and made it a lot less likely
you know people are asking and this is a good one and I think it's easy what were
some of the strains that were being labeled as beasters coming over the
border I think that probably you know the funny part is is that I wonder how
much accuracy there was between the grower the broker you know I would think
that a lot would be different and but come over with similar names because I
think that would be whatever's in demand you know this would actually be I don't
know if our buddy is on here tonight but but a list of strain names he could
probably pump out or I see Kootenai on here and people were actually commenting
to about how many good strains there was in Canada there was a bunch of amazing
strains in Canada it's not to diss Canada it's just that the choices that
got made to be grown for commercial consumption in America wasn't
necessarily the creme de la creme of the choices of Canadian wheat yeah it was
grown for export yeah I remember a lot of hash plant being talked about coming
down the m39 the grapefruit yeah all the stuff that they're naming specifically
m39 a lot was BC big buds things that things that got them a bunch of shish
kaberry things that got them a bunch of weight yeah and didn't take that long
you know and a lot of times to me I don't know about I don't know about if
other people saw names but mine was most most of the time that we saw it it had
letter grades they have like a letter grades like you know here triple a a B
you know B minus it would literally have it would literally a lot of them would
literally have just letters on okay I mean of course everyone tried to claim
their shit was triple or quadruple a or whatever yeah I doubt many were saying
yeah I got some C shit want to try it yeah you know but sometimes I mean
sometimes it wasn't good enough to like try to play the game yeah like I'm gonna
give you some B you know and I'll say this too this is this has nothing to do
with my world but one of the reasons why they were able to fuck with us so much
as far as like the price rate is that back then one American dollar got you
about a dollar sixty in Canadian yeah so the exchange rate was amazing yeah you
know I'm saying so imagine you could sell your weed and you know and and for
every you know for a for in it's like they got such an exchange rate right yeah
I mean you sell you weed for you know I mean it's so so they were flipping it
and for us it seemed low but for them they were getting a killer price sure
you know because and that's and that's and that's the way it worked and it came
you know and so it took a while but eventually just like when I lived in
Chicago I never even heard the word tweaker you never heard the word tweak
never heard the word tweaker there wasn't tweak in my high school it didn't
exist it did not it did not now eventually it it fucking it permeated
and it was all over the Midwest but I straight-up tell you in the early 90s
when I was in high school like it didn't exist so if someone would have said
tweaker to me then right yeah it wouldn't have meant much now it has like
an enormous amount of meaning because you just know so much right so you talk
about what I what I mean by that is you talk about Beasters today and it has an
enormous amount of meaning to people yeah but you have to realize when
Beasters first started hitting America we didn't have all this pre-loaded
knowledge about what it was like yeah it was just not weed that wasn't Mexican
yeah right you know and yeah there was a dude didn't come to the first week I
ever saw in Chicago it was ravers from San Francisco who brought it yeah it was
on the west coast but in the mid in the early and mid 90s it was not in the
Midwest yeah everyone pardon me for getting fucked up before the show the
last few weeks have been past my move shit so I'm not not too terribly
brilliant or quick with it my apologies so everybody's like fuck you looks high
for once so people said people are still asking what's it what's a Beaster Beaster
is Canadian indoor yeah grown for America and usually it's it's usually
it's harvested a little too soon it's not flushed or dried the right way and
then they put it into airtight seal meal bags lightly lightly to somewhat
compressed and figured out how to get it into America because there was such a
demand for weed yeah they could sell they could sell endless amounts of it
yeah and so there was a huge I mean the New England was flooded with it New York
was flooded with it you know the upper Midwest you know the west coast and all
that and then you know it depended like it got basically knocked off in in the
west coast reasonably fast because of 9-11 and then because of the burgeoning
215 movement right but it persisted for years in other parts of the country I'm
sure it didn't it sure it is it still persists now do you think I don't know
yeah I don't know either I don't know I mean you know it I couldn't tell you I
mean I bet I bet it does I bet there's markets for it maybe somewhere up in the
north I can't say you know who knows could be it could go it could go all
places in this it could be gone I don't know yeah I mean it's gone in California
I don't see brick weed as much anymore in California rarely if ever and it was
that was like all that was here during my teenagers I mean I live in Mendoza and
and I'm not fucking 15 so I don't you know I don't I haven't seen brick weed
in forever yeah yeah no it went like even the past maybe 10 years it's still
99% of what you'd see people smoking a baby still blunts and blunts and blunts
of fucking brick yeah so people are talking Kelly outdoors the new beasters
and Kelly and stuff you know and like there's I live in California right and
there there's a lot of weed that sucks yeah you know if there's never there's
never been an era where everyone just grew the fucking white hot fire and
that's all there was yeah I know I mean how many people really grow out of
everybody that's in this chat how many people really grow like the banging you
know I mean realistically if you compare it all it's not all gonna be the same
level and then you know on top of that it's it's like sometimes that shitty
weed is still the best that you can get like so the what sucks is that the
places with the least choice probably get stuck with the shittiest weed the
longest yeah because it gets dislodged in places with choice yeah you know and
you know and so you know and there's an aspect to where it's like there's
there's probably a story there we've been talking about it for a while
actually but there's probably a story there of how like of where America gets
its weed yeah and how that's shifted because in the because there was an era
there for a long time where you know all of a sudden a lot of people were getting
weed and you can you can laugh at Kelly weed but like there was a lot of people
getting reasonably good quality weed from from out here that was grown with a
reasonable amount of love too yeah you know and now there's an aspect to where
people are complaining about where things have gone legal and the black
market is just exploded between the Asians and the Eastern Europeans and the
cartels and all that and Southern Oregon and the deserts out by you yeah you know
and and all that and like now there's a shit ton of weed being grown by people
that don't care at all and people yeah we might we might have a resurgence too
because of all these people buying fucking skunk one seeds we might have a
whole fucking beast of resurgence can't wait and so you know there's there's an
aspect to where it's like a lot of the best California weed is getting cut off
you know people think you know because that's another aspect right where it's
all the it's all the brokers and the people that make it go from here to
there yeah they choose what what goes from here to there yeah and they're
looking at it from their perspective of what's profitable sure and just like
with the Beasters if they can send some some shittier stuff that way that they
had a much bigger margin on and that and that that run makes them a lot more
money that's probably what they'll do you know so it's like everyone you can
all all y'all on southeast or east or wherever you are that like is bitching
about California weed it's probably your fucking broker the person that brought
it there right yeah they chose there was fire weed that they probably tried to
tried to fucking you know tried to lowball or turn down because it didn't
make them as much of a margin sure right in the margins everything's margins you
know and so you know if you knew somebody that like their their whole gig
was quality and and fire and that's what they wanted to work with fine yeah if
you knew people that were like well they're not gonna have much choice in
this part so we're just gonna ship them with this then you're probably fucked
yeah you know then you're probably fucked and you know and so I'm sure you
know there's I'm sure there's still beast you know even if it's greatly
reduced you know I mean right now it you know most people were getting a lot of
weed from Mendo and Humboldt and Trinity and a lot of smaller scenes that would
all get aggregated together yeah and now all that all that is the Asians and
the Bulgarians and the and the frickin and the cartels and all that growing
massive plots yeah and you know why would a broker go and and you know and
and so you're getting shit of your weed yeah you're getting shit of your weed
you know lots of people in California have the fire that doesn't mean that
like every person in the chain between you and California is going to ensure
that that fire makes it to you most of its one second
so people are yeah and you know people are people Delta 8 is the new beast you
know how many things when when hemp became legal people started growing hemp
and then spraying it with distillate oh lord yeah you know and literally and
and then moving that somewhere right if there's a if there's a arbitrage
opportunity where people can make a big-ass fucking margin yeah by buying
something shittier and passing it off as something way better they're going to
and they're gonna do that with hash there was a whole thing hash isn't my
thing but you know how much you know you guys know how much like CRC cheap
extracted hash got passed off as something nicer you know it's always
been that way the most common way in Mendo was I mentioned it before but
these depths are so beautiful I can sell them as indoor and I'll get a better
price point yeah this outdoor is so fire it looks like it like it's a well
preserved death and I can get you more money I think that's why Lumpa like the
West Coast dog because he could sell it off as indoor pretty sure I mean people
people are and then and then there's everyone and then even if you're
honorable all it takes is one non-honorable person in the chain yeah
it doesn't take much it doesn't take much you know and so yeah people are
talking the old OG is around a bunch there's tons of people that have nice
OG's yeah it's just a matter of is it getting grown in bulk to come to
wherever you are probably not is it getting grown with the same recipe they
were using back then probably not probably not you know and you know and
so there's an aspect where yeah hemp sprayed with distillate there's anytime
there's a way where they can find some cheap-ass shit and convince you that
it's nicer shit there's someone in the middle that's making a bunch of money
off that so yeah I'm gonna go up there and they would fucking buy you know
$200 you know hemp pounds in Oregon and then they would take a paint sprayer and
they would spray it with distillate so it would get you high and then they'd
sell it as real outdoor one way to do it I mean that's kind of that's kind of
someone just said Athena OG there is a bunch of I don't know what the fuck is
going on but there's a bunch of legal scenes and there's a bunch of their
followers and stuff like that that have decided that the cheapest salts on earth
are of course like automated delivery is the way to grow weed and their weed
isn't as nice yeah you know their weed isn't as nice and so you know there's
there's gonna be all kinds of that with hash there's gonna be all kinds of that
with weed and you know it it because if there's a if there's an education
difference I mean you know how many times I used to hear up here people
would look at something and they would be like oh this is fire but can they
break down some of these bigger buds a little bit more why right huh why cuz
indoor doesn't have big buds oh I guess that makes them they're trying to pass
it off so it's like right I don't need anything like this bro you need to make
it yeah yeah you know because they're in their mind they're gonna they're
gonna they're gonna pass it off as symbol as some bullshit yeah they're
gonna say they're you know and they don't and they don't want the customer
to be like oh these look like sun-grown nuts yeah cuz then they just shaved off
X off their percentage they were planning on making so you know people
California and the West Coast can get a bad rap and there's plenty of bad weed
here but it's also like you know it's it's it's also a bunch of choices in
between yeah you know and I think I don't know I think Athena is just like
fucking Lux lighting I think Athena is probably owned by jungle boys and they
sure and they and they promote the shit out of it saying that they've tested it
against all kinds of different other other nutrients and it's come out the
best and they grow the fire and then they build up a bunch of sales for
Athena and it's cheap and then they're gonna offer and they're gonna off the
company and make a shit ton of money possible yeah when if you want to use
something like Athena you can go buy some real cheap salts that doesn't have
the Athena makeup that's probably the exact same thing just in a different bag
that's how a lot of nutrient companies are done I mean you know there's one
supplier and they ask for certain mixes and ranges but it's all based out of the
same shit you know that happens a lot yeah you know it happens a lot you know
and so there's there's an aspect where it's like I don't dis on all salts
there's salts I like quite a bit actually for the application I'm a
garden sucker in Canada but I like Canada I like Canada I like cutting-edge
shout out to my buddy John you know there's there's good salts out there
used properly that'll do fine for you you know there's even even stuff like
Jack's the main issue with some of the cheaper stuff is now they do a bunch of
testing a lot of it has high heavy metal content or other additives that
aren't the jam yeah you know I like I like the empty someone's asking for like
a good dry salt I like the NPK brand where you can buy each individual
element separately so you can run it exactly as you want I like that a lot if
someone's gonna use something old and basic I would I would almost just say
use Jack's Jack's three two one you know it's like a classic you know isn't
that the OG recipe Jack's is that might be yeah and you know I said cutting-edge
you know full disclosure like my buddy John owns cutting-edge he started it in
oh one he's been a grower he was grower up here from the 70s on and so I'm in
Mendo he knows he it's like one of the first nutrients formulated for growers
by an old grower yeah and he's real he's real smart he's a real nice guy
and it's supporting one of us you know and people ask me how do I feel about
the new line I use the new line they're louder powder they call it I use that on
like a big farm down south for a year and a half before I left so you know but
there's an aspect there where it's like they you know Beasters was sort of our
first Beasters was sort of like the first commercial weed that came to
America that wasn't Mexican that was in the first indoor commercial yeah right
because Americans weren't really able to pull off hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of lights like the way the BC crews were doing at the time and the
Canadian crews were doing you know so it's kind of like Beast to me like some
of that stuff isn't that different than like a lot of these like big rock wall
farms you see right now and fucking legal scenes it's almost like we've
come full circle yeah it's just dried nicer you know but it's still that
cardboard weed yeah you know and all that you know so people talk about
cutting-edge talking I mean nutrients its own whole thing or whatever but
there's a you know a nutrients pretty misunderstood but you know there's an
aspect where you know you could get people that are trying to grow the best
weed they can and trying to get a really nice number for it or you can get people
that are just in a in a larger group that are just trying to grow the cheapest
weed they can and still get the best price they can get it yeah you know and
so you know there's a you know there's an aspect where it's like I don't know I
almost think that probably all that stuff that they like people dis on
California for going east was probably better than their alternatives I would
think so I would hope better than it was better than B. it was probably better
grown than B. stir and it was certainly nicer than Mexico yeah you know and it
got so successful that people diss it now but why did it get that successful
because it was better you know there was plenty of famous cuts or varieties that
were there were during the B. stir era like I was saying before I covered it
kind of covered it Northern Lights Mighty Might grapefruit donkey donkey
anything that was anything that was big you know 39 was just is probably the
most associated with it I'd have to say yeah you know and there's an aspect
there's a guy a dude I know from Mendoz saying I organic sun-grown you know
there's an aspect of like what's the best right but obviously what people are
facing in the in the in the market right now is that you know a lot of times
they're not rewarded for the best yeah Island Sweet Skunk is fire the silver
pearl is fire too Friesland I don't know if I'd call that fire that was a little
bit midsy at least as far as the stuff that I saw yeah but but yeah you know
there's a there's a part of it where see now it's like I start reading the
comments and I just like lose track of whatever the fuck I was talking about so
I apologize everyone fucking up I I started reading what people I do and
then and then all of a sudden I'm like what the hell was I even just just
discussing but you know it um they were asking you to do a what do you call
those where when someone dies on for I'm a chief I think they wanted you to
eulogy eulogy I mean you know Jaime was a Jaime was an interesting cat you know
I'll say that you know the old-timers like him the guys in their 60s and
their 70s a lot of times the stories they tell they don't come with a lot of
like corroboration from others so it's like how much do you how much do you
take at face value and not just him Neville said you know Sam's gunk man
Mel you can name tons of different folks right and you know and and and so you
know he he was obviously a collector and you know he the last five or ten years
or so probably he started he started spreading his seeds out to lots of
different people you would say right he wanted a lot of different people to try
his stuff yes yes you know and he was pretty free with sharing seeds with
people or sending them things you know I would say so there's and that's good in
the sense that if you want to keep his work alive a lot of people have it it'll
be interesting to see if you know I'm sure it's already happening who starts
to exploit the fact that he's gone yeah you know but you know he I mean you know
he claimed to have our chaos he was the original DJ short according to him he
he claimed that you know he had a massive role in blueberry yeah and that
yeah that he was the real DJ short you know he was the guy that was actually
responsible for creating blueberry yeah type and he said his they called him DJ
short literally literally DJ short and so you know yeah he he was an interesting
character because obviously you know he had a lot of claims it's you know it
seemed like he was he was doing this thing up there you know in Alaska and
spreading his seeds out and they all came with some wild stories and rest in
peace buddy yeah I don't know I just yeah I mean I'm glad he liked seeds I
glad he liked weed we all share that in common rest in peace and you know it's
it wouldn't be the you know I mean what are you even supposed to say about
comments like that obviously we know the blueberry story to be what it is
yeah you know and that would be like somebody coming out and saying fuck this
Sam skunk man guy he stole my skunk and hayseeds and fled to Europe and I went
to prison and everything that comes out of his mouth is bullshit he used to
work for me yeah but you've got like this massive amount of history of
assumption yes which is that DJ did it so trying to trying to shift all that is
a major that's a big shift that's a big shift it is a big shift that's a bit but
he wasn't quiet about it no you know I just said it like matter of fact so it's
like how the how am I supposed to know yeah but then there's also this thing
too where I think blueberry is a common enough name you know that day short isn't
I mean DJ shorts not a common enough name and especially when you combine
blueberry it kind of means that one of them is not telling the truth and it's
just up to you guys to figure out who you believe yeah I mean he was I mean
it's like I don't know if he's I haven't listened to the to the interview he just
did I don't know if he I don't know if he wants to do that I don't know if you
want the depth on it or anything like that you know but I mean people are
talking about pre DJ short blueberry there's blueberry out there that people
talk about 79 blueberry that people are growing you know so who knows but you
know it one thing I'll always say about breeders is you know is I always give
the advice of grow what you like make things that you like you know and then
at the very least you know like it you like it yeah you know which is the core
thing so Jaime did a bunch of work that he liked and had a lot of big stories
about it and started spreading them all out yep you know I've never tried never
grown any of his seeds to be perfectly honest Oh yumble so he's the yumble guy
too that's fucking sick dude he would have reputation leave behind god bless I
mean yumble was yumble it was one of the nicest things that Adam Dunn's when he
started th seeds had was it was a sager mathis strain I believe and a matter
strain yeah and it and it was supposed to be a seed representation of an old
clone called humble maybe just call a yumble maybe Adam had a maybe Adam had a
I mean those guys were all tied together yeah exactly he might have used it but
maybe they had a different version or who knows who knows what who knows what
the the thing so you know I'm not I'm not trying to you know it's sad that he
passed motorcycles are dangerous yeah you know there's no there's nothing
protect there's no nothing protecting you right so you could be an amazing
biker and someone else could do something dumb and you're fucked yeah
you know Chris it's fucking dangerous and so but you know it's it's uh you
know he had a you know he's given some interviews and he spread out a bunch of
his seeds and stuff like that or Neville one of the yeah I didn't want to get it
all he said he was a backup for Neville he worked under Neville he was the real
DJ short he had real RKS that's a lot of big claims yeah it is a lot of big
claims and you know I always go back to like when people pass we tend to
sanctify them which you know means declare them some sainthood you forget
about all the other stuff I have a really bad personality where I keep the
same energy that I had when they were alive so I'll just say I wish that I
wish the guy in his family the best it's not fun to lose anyone and I know
I have a lot of friends in the community and I hope they all you know pull
together and and and find a way through it yeah and you know hopefully people
find things that they like amongst his beans yeah for sure and if you do keep
them alive keep them going you know and and and and figure and figure all that
out you know I mean I have the same issue too like you know with telling
certain stories you know it's always hard with weed because there are certain
people that don't really want to be mentioned yeah and don't want their
stories told all that much yeah and and but then maybe they played an important
role in history there's one person just for people asking there's one person
that we know for sure in the US that worked directly with Neville at any
level and it was at a very small level and that was Clyde Stevens so anybody
else making that claim it cannot be corroborated at all or even a little bit
yeah Clyde and Clyde was Neville's photographer yep and it's it's verified
that Clyde Neville went to Afghanistan together and also an Operation Green
Merchant they were both kind of a part of it so they were both kind of a part
of it yeah there's a bunch of pictures there's a lot of he was a photographer
so there's a lot of photographic evidence of all that you know yeah but
you know what's what Matt and I always laugh about whenever we hear whether
it's from Hawaii or Alaska or wherever that of course you would pick someone to
back up your stuff that lives on another continent in a country where the DEA is
trying to put you away for life in prison for decades on end yeah that is
the most convenient place that you would try to back up all of your stuff and do
and do phenol hunting and testing and conversations and be involved you know
yep rather than somebody down the street in Holland or somebody in in the
Netherlands somewhere or Europeans in general you know but then who's to say I
mean so there's aspects where there's certain stories that Matt and I know are
provably false yeah and then there's ones that like they have some parts
where you really wonder could they be you know if they're true or not but you
don't have any proof one way or the other it's just the story you know and
was and in the interview I mean we can kind of bring this up now so we posted
an interview on patreon for our patreon subscribers that was an interview with a
man in Kevin Bjornson and he was a major part of the Northern Lights crew he was
a part of Operation Green Merchant I don't know if the story really is that
he was Green Merchant per se but I know he believes that story very deeply that
he is the reason for the season on it but we did post it and I wanted to get
some feedback from you guys and tell me from the people who listen what you guys
thought about it and I know one of the questions right now was was he the Green
Merchant and I do know according to him that he did write down some license
plate numbers from people he says they weren't real but that was a part of the
Operation Green Merchant bust so all that what the the basic story of Green
Merchant for so people that don't know is in 1989 a grocery store got busted
for being tied into weed and when they raided it supposedly they found a
series of Neville's catalogs with written out orders and money and names
and whatnot yeah and then they realized okay that Neville was selling millions
of dollars in seed to all these people all over America right and they freaked
out okay because they had no idea this was going on and supposedly even more so
than that and this is that Neville actually did this thing where he sent
guys with suitcases full of wheat full of seeds to America and supposedly most
of the seeds that he did were mailed from America the money went to the money
went to Holland yeah I mean allegedly like allegedly and then I mean he's dead
what are you gonna do he's dead now but no he's so oh no yeah no no yeah and you
know Neville had there was some Neville was mailing seeds from within the US
with a compatriot and then getting the money in Holland and no one had any idea
he was doing this because he was the first seed bank so nobody really
realized that there was anything going on and when Green Merchant when they
realized that people in grocery stores were like buying and selling seeds yeah
and some of these stores were like buying a bunch of seeds and then selling
them to their customers with the lights they did this thing called Operation
Green Merchant where they raided every single hydroponic store in the country
yeah all at once all at once boom same day same time everything same day same
time nationwide nationwide raid and the gentleman that we did the interview with
you know he was part of that he owned a grocery store he was tied into the whole
Northern Lights Pacific Northwest crew right and had one of the only grocery
stores in that area one of the first so he was one of the biggest targets at the
time and so that is sort of the the domino that when when Matt interviewed
Greg all the Northern Lights crew got busted yeah like it was rolling bust
they got customer lists they got all kinds of things different people snitched
different people ratted on each other somebody at 1989 yeah 1989 Operation
Merchant happened every single hydroponic store in the country was
raided same day same time and then they took a bunch of evidence that they got
from that and they took a bunch of people that's what Matt was saying was
that they after they raided him they made Bjornson write down a bunch of
license plate numbers and it's debatable on whether he gave them real ones or not
he claims that he wrote down fake ones that were not related to the grocery
store but they that was when people used to get scared like when I first started
growing we would always go to the grocery store in a vehicle that a friend
that lived a clean life yeah and I would pay him because we were always worried
about our license plate getting written down or a picture of the vehicle getting
taken with the license plate you know because this had just happened and they
used to you know and because weed was totally illegal everywhere yeah and
that's what got that's what got Neville thrown into prison for a year yeah and
he was fighting extradition to the United States and that's when he lost
his his seed company because he had to sell it to the drunkards for them to pay
for him to get out of jail and get back to Holland yeah and you know and you
know we thought about for a long time we didn't we did that interview quite a
long time ago and we decided not to release it mostly because our our
general theme here has sort of been like history and weed education and and weed
people bullshitting yeah and most people don't know but I was a I tried to be an
active participant in that interview I just couldn't get a word in yeah and
then I think Matt got a couple of words in a few sentences here and there yeah
but it was basically like a mass monologue from the dude yeah and while
he has an immense amount of weed knowledge in his head and an immense
amount of stories he could tell from that time frame he was much more
interested in telling stories of his wild youth and politics I think he
thought the interview was more about his life as opposed to what we talked about
yeah we were hoping to sort of get a weed centric one thing that we did get
was that he did say didn't he say that the old g13 and the UW was sort of what
was one in the same yeah and I got a few times in a few other places so when I
heard that I was like wait what what what yeah no I mean he he I mean he was
and the reason why we interviewed him was because Greg Seattle Greg of NL
fame was like this guy was there he was around he was connected to all of us
he's the one that you need to talk to he's the one that's gonna tell you
everything he's the one that you need to know he has so much stuffed up in that
head yeah and then you know it was about 45 seconds of actual weed info and
then a bunch of you know crazy politics and hookers and and this and that but
there was some interesting green merchant stuff yeah the green merchants
stuff I thought was interesting because he was really wrapped up in that he was
one of the store owners that was raided by the feds and he basically admitted
that he had to cooperate with them to not go to prison for a long time yes but
that he tried to fake all the information they got so no one else got
in trouble yeah you know and you know so people are out who knows dude yeah
right but yeah but you know you dub being g13 and adding to that story and
like you know he set up tons of growers he grew a bunch of different strains
back then and he probably could have chatted for an hour and a half about
just that yeah but that really wasn't what interested him so he just started
rapidly politically charged time to is I think it's right before the election so
it yeah yeah it was probably fresh in his mind and he's I was yet he's not
older than in a retirement home I think or something like that and so just to be
able to talk to people you know there was a lot there was a lot of stories
yeah you know there was a lot of stories and so we didn't release it for
a long time because it was pretty light on wheat yeah you know I was it was
certainly colorful sure yeah that was funny as hell it was certainly colorful
I mean there was an aspect to people like where he said he he tested positive
for cocaine yeah to his probation officer but it was only because he was
eating out a hooker and he I mean he had some pretty it was a it was it was
yeah it was he had some pretty crazy stories you know yeah and you know and
so but that's but with that what that is is that's a really good indication of a
lot of these old old-time guys that you want to talk to you want them to just
like dish out an immense amount of lineage and specific history yeah and a
lot of them it's really hard to get it out of that yeah for sure they don't
it's it's not it's it's it's either don't remember or they didn't write it
down or you know DJ short was like that yeah Greg was certainly like that when
you start asking a bunch of specifics about the various NL numbers that was
hard if you go back and listen to that that first interview with Greg it was me
and my friend Kansa at the time doing the interview and he was not so much as
interested in talking about the past more talking about the future and I
think that that's a lot you know I mean that's not a lot of art you know it's
like you don't want to diss who they are now yeah but what you're really after is
like you know you're lucky if you play any kind of cool moment in history once
yeah much less repeatedly you know so you talk to some of these guys and it's
like they you know like you know the amount of knowledge and and information
that Ben and Alan drunkers have oh I'm sure but they're terrible and everyone's
told me you can't get jack shit out of them and they just tow the line that
their business is the exact same it's that like they don't they won't tell it
just doesn't matter I think I think also like just because they were there it
doesn't mean that they paid any attention at all to what was going on or
cared enough to memorize anything their business dudes you know yeah they just
it just wasn't it wasn't what they were into you know I mean you would think
that like you know that steep that that's Greg would remember a bunch of
stuff but he was basically just like oh the one and the two you know he knew a
couple things yeah and then he was like the rest was just a wild orgy of sativas
and different things we were trying and that it that it notes got you in trouble
so yeah you know and nl9 never made it out like that just for people to know
that's just never happened yeah nl9 got popular I will say that nl9 was a legend
and Neville sold it for like maybe one year as a hybrid to some other shit like
maybe nl9 by skunk one or something yeah and then it disappeared and nobody saw
it for 10 or 15 years yeah but what I'm referring to is the nl9 from Greg that
wasn't right that was passed yeah no and then and then all of a sudden the name
nl9 started showing up in Canadian seed banks sure yeah after like not not being
around for a long time yeah it was one of those ones that like re popped yeah
you know and yeah and so you know there's there's parts of that where it's
like people you know Jaime Kevin some of these old guys they're they're like that
they're you know we people are kooky and a lot of times we are quirky and a lot of times we get
quirkier as we age I'm pretty fucking quirky myself so I can't throw any shade yeah you know
you're not even you're not even all that old yet you know until you're fucking cranky and and I
don't know something like that you know yeah I know and I am oh skunk 2 is interesting somebody
said my buddy had some skunk 2 from an old heads but he killed them all yeah skunk 2 was uh I've
been waiting for someone to pop up and say they have skunk 2 yeah you know it's it's it's one of
those I did hear there was there was someone that I won't mention that that said they used to get it
in the 90s in Arizona oh really you know it did exist you know yeah it did it did exist you know
and it was it was a little it was taken in a little different direction than skunk one but it
just I don't know it seemed like that's another one of those skunk six in Leadville somebody talked
about that that is a totally different thing that's a specific cut yeah right and that cut
and the MS and the original MSS that my buddy got back east and brought west is the exact same cut
yes I believe it's lost and and as best we know it was supposed to be what a super skunk hybrid of
some sort yeah I mean what we chatted with the guy who made it skunk VA's mentor or whatever
to and he was a little light on details like a lot of these old guys he's kind of a you know
a rainbow cat or whatever but he talked about he got skunks from Neville and from super city the
seed club for two or three years yeah and bred them together and called it his skunky skunk yeah
right and then he took that and he crossed it to super skunk when super skunk first came out and
then that the skunk six or the super skunk that that went to chem dog and math in mass from my
buddy who brought it west that's all the same pheno of that dudes work yes you know and then
you know and then there's a whole story behind that guy had to go on the run for some Grateful
Dead related shit for a long time and it seemed like a bunch of people in Colorado called it the
skunk six and our little crew in California just referred to it as super skunk yes both appear to
be gone yes maybe you know I mean me I mean there's there's there's a lot of rumor what it
seems like hat what happened is that there's some later stuff that's way more Afghan that's called
MSS that floats around Massachusetts and that was pictured in the high times later on that's very
different looking than the original one it's squatter more Afghan thicker all that and and so
there's a lot of people I think that have it but don't have the first one yeah I know there was a
selection blaze it panda did from a was it was sour dub cross to reverse diesel that I had done
and he selected a pheno from it that was dead on identical looking to the the mass superscum shown
in the high times Kim dog issue and that that has made the rounds as mass super itself and we've
tried to tell people that's not it but it doesn't matter I mean there's an aspect to where it's like
eventually because it's just a legend to almost everyone right because the percentage of people
out there that actually legitimately grew the cut is quite small actually right so anything that has
those turps or anything that could be plausibly claimed we've already seen five or six years of
claims made without any proof yep that people don't find anything right yeah there's a whole
era there where there's there's there's companies that put skunk on their logo real big on their
logo and they don't have any skunk you know there's people that have ancient skunk and old
skunk and my skunk is the rare skunk that before the skunk got taken out of the skunk and I don't
have any weed of it but this is the skunky skunk or oh I got this real MSS I'm gonna cross it to a
bunch of stuff now we're gonna sell all these seeds you'll find the skunk in there for sure
yeah and you know and it's like that that you know but I mean anybody that came up with anything
smelling skunky would be like that's kind of the goal that's what people are missing I don't I
don't think it's so much the actual cut I think it's the lost turp yeah for the most part there's
might be some bragging rights to the old cut or whatever but it's it's basically more likes like
skunk doesn't smell like skunk and the closest thing we have is real diesel the most most often
when I see people pop up and say man that shit smells skunky is after someone has burned and
exhaled a bowl of really loud weed of any type of smell I see a lot of people pop up and say that
smells skunky after that I kind of feel like certain old sours you get that weird nose crinkle
sure and it's not a pure super skunk nose but it's kind of on that same path yeah you know it's
like an analog of it or something like that it's a derivative no you know it's a yeah it is it's a
feel and it's and they're and they're volatile too you know so so there's hints out there of it and
stuff like that but I got it I just got totally distracted by homies comment you know but we have
talked about Neville talked about like crossing some of his or Shanti's old work together that
had skunk in it and trying to see if you'd get recessives to pop up yeah and I think that's
probably the way to get skunk is to get cuts of things that you think have skunk in it and throw
them on one another and hopefully you know you get some recessives that pop out because that's
probably what happened with our homies cut the sour dub by the reverse diesel yeah and it cry
baby seen it I've seen it if you cross two of two different phenos of or expressions of super skunk
that are like if you cross the lanky longer flowering sour type with one of the short stocky
more mass super mass super v2 I should say types then usually you're gonna get something in there
that's popping up that's pretty skunk your candy push skunky it does seem like using out crosses to
find it is a better way than s1f you know yeah like it's got both of it in there and then you're
just hoping for that thing to combine yeah you know because it should combine it's just a matter
of it's just a matter of doing a large enough populations sure you know and you could do a
thing if you could do traditional breeding you could do something where you got large enough
populations where you could probably make make the the quantity of skunk go up yeah yeah sure
it's really hard to do on a garage size scene yeah very you know I agree with homie four-way is
dutted the old-school four-way is dutted it's a shadow of its former self yeah there's some liars
out there that think they're KNF and their various organic treatments heal things yeah and while
there's no doubt that you can make a plant happier or unhappier based on your treatment of it that
doesn't mean it's gonna cure it of AIDS yeah yeah people ask I I do think it could pop up in the LA
Kush by Kendi and I do think that a lot of people a lot of people are finding potency in it but I
would not be surprised I wouldn't be surprised because the the LA is very diesel type and I do
believe they're super skunk and Kendi although that's controversial yeah you know but I'd also
think crossing different sours to each other D by sour headbands at least the the diesel headbands
yeah we don't know if someone's asking we don't know if if if if TC works there's some evidence
that it does but there's also some there's I mean it's it's I don't know if there's a lot of there's
a lot of rumor that floats around yeah and it gets mixed with fact a lot yes there is you know so it's
not that easy to figure I don't even know that we know the definitive answer to all this stuff it
probably needs more testing yeah you know giveaway so start thinking of how we're gonna give this
away or a good competition or something I've got to find something worth giving away though
that sounds like something we probably could have done off off-camera but we'll bring it I suppose
no cameras no fun come on now and then tissue culture just so people know tissue culture is
is just a method of doing something it doesn't cure jackshit tissue culture you can you can tissue
culture and all you're doing is cultivating a bunch of small plantlets yeah right the tissue
culture that people are talking about so that actually might clean things up or like remove
say like you know remnants of various chemicals that you don't want is actually called marist
em tissue culture and it's where you take cells from the marist em and you regrow the whole plant
and it it it took you know it can take up to a year to get that back and the hormones are all nuts
and out of whack for a while too and we're not even sure that it's the exact same plant so there's
a lot of aspects to marist em culture that are and it's expensive too it's like four to six
thousand bucks per plant super expensive and barely anybody can do it correctly but a lot of
people will tell you they can so there's people like there's people like dark heart that spread
the dud all over the place that didn't offer tissue culture and heat treatment that they claim
kills the dud then you hear from other nurseries and friends that you trust that it doesn't really
the dud on a perfect level but they're gonna charge you for it you know so there's a you know
there's a lot of there's a lot of issues with it on that level and you know the disease is getting
very prevalent and there's a lot of old strains that suffer from it there's even rumor that I
don't know that's proven that a certain percentage of seeds made from dotted stuff the virus carries
into the children into the beans yeah and I don't think that's proven I've heard as high as 50% and
as low as 2 or 3% yeah I've heard various friends of mine including CSI and others tell me that
they've grown out testers and everything looks fine yeah so I think it's really hard to say you
know I mean you could you could still have a virus inside of you that you wouldn't have it wouldn't
have a physically visible level that's very true you know yeah so you know so TC is thrown around
pretty loosely the only easy that cleans anything up to my knowledge is Marissa that's how I understand
it you know and Marist and basically like get mostly what it does really well is it will clean
your plant up if it was if a chloroplet or added or a bunch of funk was used on it because those
cells are taken from the Marist em not from the vascular system yeah and so it's sort of like
avoid the area of the plant that's contaminated and you can grow it back but you know the the
dutting or the you know the the you know the virus the byroid or whatever it basically spread
everywhere because when everyone started getting clones from dispensaries and everyone started
getting clones from certain nurseries and nurseries sort of became a clearinghouse for a bunch of
plants they spread it to thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars or gardens I mean yeah
you know and then once that happened those gardens started spreading into their friends you know and
a lot of times you know back in the day you'd use a razor taking clones until it got dull yeah you
know and now you need to per plant you need to take a lot of different you need to take a lot
of different things into account and and that that one viral byroid that causes dutting isn't the
only dutting issue there's other diseases you know TMV is the most famous one that everything
anything wrong with weed for a long time people would be like oh you got the TMV oh yeah for sure
and people used to think that like the the mosaic or the variegation that used to happen in chem
strains and other Afghans was a sure sign of TMV yeah you know but I will say that if you talk to
tobacco people right they do treat TMV extremely seriously and they do they don't allow harvester
people doing transplanting and working on their stuff you can't have a smoker in the home yeah
and you have to take off all your clothes and get and go through a process to get in there so it
does spread and you can definitely get it on your hands from smoking cigarettes and you can pass it
you know but but there's there's pythium and fusarium that are there's molds there's viruses
there's thyroids there's diseases and they mostly were were minimal in the illegal 215 era sure and
now they're all over the place you know so you know yeah I mean yeah someone just said TMV can
wipe out a whole tobacco crop they do they take a bunch of precautions even by touch you know and
someone said that you know someone said that russets don't dud a plant out dudding is what
we call russets can I suppose lose you oh did he freeze there he is am I back he came back yep there
I am did I freeze yep I froze yeah I don't know what the hell happened but anyway there's there's
a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of disease there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff
out there that people didn't have to worry about before and as things have gotten commercialized
and as things have gotten spread around you know it's become what it's become a way bigger issue
and it would be easier if it would be easier if it didn't transfer to see not so throws am I back
can you everyone hear me in real time yeah you're back I think I can hear you you think
yeah bad russet infestation can look like a viroid you know and there's and there's rumors
to that thrips and other and other insects can spread viroids or spread diseases like mosquitoes
spread you know malaria and shit like that yeah so there's a lot of risks out there there's a lot
of risk out there that didn't do before in the 90s I didn't worry about anything I'd never seen
p.m. and an occasional bug every now and again no viruses no diseases no worries but we've had
friends that have taken out their whole garden yeah lost irreplaceable and lost irreplaceable
shit you know so Matt's over here in real time going through a seed collection and grunting to
himself and all that so I've really given it his full attention right now I found some shit I
didn't remember I had some old Afghanis and shit but it's interesting people are talking about
condoms or STDs and stuff like that like you know it's it's it's not they're obviously plants so
they're not human beings but there is some correlation between the various things that
got spread around and the HIV AIDS crisis yeah and that there was something spreading that was
harming and people didn't know what it was and they didn't know what to test for it and they
didn't know how to take precautions about it and so it spread like wildfire you know yeah leaf
hoppers normally they they they pass this curly top beat virus thing so there's a bunch of there's
a bunch of diseases and some of them probably existed for a while and like people just weren't
getting the proper testing because why would you help why would you do that yeah you know
because you're up you're you're in the in the shadows or whatever and you know and you know
they oh man I just got totally distracted by somebody's comment I'm not gonna repeat it but
but they but yeah they you know and and most of the time when people were trading cuttings or or
you know or or selling their friends cuttings it was all within little circles yeah you know and
it wasn't until the 215 era and these big centralized nurseries that things started
getting spread all over you know and then once it reaches a certain point it becomes really easy
to spread and then you're spreading it to your friends and you don't know what have and then
you know a lot of people would a lot of people would give up on creating their own mothers and
and making their own clones and they just be like fuck the veg I'm just gonna go to wherever and
buy 200 cuts when it's time yeah you know and uh yeah weird comment at the end that's what that's
what gets me into trouble is it's hard to bullshit and read comments in real time when you read it
comment out loud the other yeah if you read a comment out loud it's super offensive yeah yeah
so you can get it's you know you can get thrown off the game and so we made it we made it like
an hour and a half without actually talking about one of the things that uh I don't think
does Pip have the shoreline I don't think he does we have some good friends of ours that do and Pip's
a good friend of ours but I don't think he does I don't think but we have we have some really close
friends of ours that have had it for quite some time and it's fire I like it I wouldn't consider
people tell me it's not it's people ask if it's RKS I would say it's skunky is from what everyone
tells me and it's got it's got rankness to it but I wouldn't say that it's uh I'd say it's not sweet
and then a lot of people confuse not sweet for roadkill skunk yeah if I was being a hundred if
you're being a hundred percent yeah you know yeah Kim was selling chem for clones the other day at
his dispo and in Massachusetts I mean you know Kim for is Kim for is the Kim for is probably the
most widely spread chem yeah you know it's that one we got spread out the largest it throws really
nice bats it's probably the least hoarded of the one of all of it you know it's still one of my
faves to out of the out of the chem for 91 or D I prefer chem for for what I like yeah I mean the
most people's issues with chem for is that it's like 12 weeks yeah and you can pull it at 10 so
there's a lot of people that pull it at 10 yeah that makes sense temp or is not very close to the
D in my opinion no no temp for is a big lanky long running buds kind of hazy type of not hazy
and like when people think terpenelein I just mean like structure and it has kind of a racy buzz do
it and do I think the cannabis community is being infiltrated to destroy home grows I think it's
always I think that's always been happening I don't I don't know that I don't know that's
never not happened I think it's evident float how intense it's been but I think home grows have
always had some issues and the main issue I used to have with chem for is that in California you
can everyone wants you to flush your weed immensely right but nobody wants a hint of yellow on
anything yeah because then they think you fucked it up and then they want less right and chem for
a lot of times dries a slight light golden brown yeah the golden the golden a little golden color
and that golden color is you know is bad people don't like the golden color it can be fresh weed
it can be sticky it can be cured amazing it can be fantastical and they'll get a little hit they'll
be like looking at the calyxes and be like uh you know it's got a little hint of brown it makes me
uncomfortable you know and you can't give anything for a giveaway I haven't actually been thinking
about a giveaway dude I've been fucking talking shit well yeah I know you look down you're doing
it's called flow dog and I don't think I don't think so chem 4 is a big tall rangy plant chem D
is a much squatter Afghan it's it's it's lighter green and in a lot of ways it's just this whole
structure is different I don't think chem 4 and chem D are very similar at all you know and it
doesn't it definitely doesn't take 84 days you know and what's interesting is we had our buddy
pip actually take an 84 day piece of chem 4 and lay it on top of a picture of Neville's 89 and l5
Hayes bud and you could barely tell the difference sure you know I do think there's Hayes and chem 4
yeah I think that I think that I think that it could be 91 by nl5 Higgs maybe I don't know
they're trying let's get back to skunk tons of people are working on skunk lines dude it's just
that they're mostly not skunk yeah and I always have to preface this because people every time I
have to restart it and say it when we say skunk we do not mean necessarily skunk one what we're
referring to is the smell of a skunk when we say it's skunky we're not saying oh it's like skunk
one we're saying it's skunky so just just to preface that so people don't confuse us saying
skunk one for skunk they are two different things in my opinion yes skunk one is floral or citrus
or maybe a little cheese maybe some grapes you know anything like yeah it doesn't have any you
know what people are talking about is our kid they want that rank nose curdling pure skunk spray type
of smell yeah you know and there's a lot of people you know we were supposed to talk about about
breeding techniques and stuff like that we never really got there people ask are they working what
there's not really very many lines being worked right now by very many people you know most people
are most people are doing the one-offs of things they hope are skunky and hoping you'll find skunk
in them or just straight frauds because there's now there's so many people that want it there's a
bunch of people jumping in claiming to have it you know yeah you can't they know that you can't
tell them they don't have it until X amount of months and most people will sit on them so yeah
you know I mean you can you can go through there's you know there's people like you know
blue or sky Vienna that fucking has their own story and they have the skunkiest skunk that's
ever skunked but nobody finds skunk in their beans and you know there's a bunch of people
doing it that you know there's not something that's not there and there's a market demand
for it and people are jumping in and saying you're gonna get skunk for me any day yep you're
gonna find this is unbelievably skunky you're gonna find skunk in it and then they sell a bunch
of what you know what do you people call it hopium hope you know hope you don't bunch of sell a bunch
of addictive hopium you know there were a few of us me and me and Bodhi were working on just
specifically finding that type of thiol or smell in in old lines and he went one direction I think
he went and looked in some Afghanis too and I popped a bunch of Afghanis looking for it and
I got very lucky and found something early on it's not the easiest thing to reproduce but I found
ways to reproduce it but by that point literally everyone had jumped on the train selling skunk one
of everything or hybrids of skunk one everything and saying it's skunky you had the blue skies
Vienna people pick in and nobody wants to be associated with that shit so some of us just
said fuck it and walked away walked away from it for good just because it's I think it's easy to
find now and I think if you look in the right places it's very easy to come across and I think
it's out there for people if they really really want it you know yeah somebody's a skunk lines
over 9,000 skunk clones zero yeah you know I don't know you'd be a millionaire or whatever
else because it's like you could have a cutting that did it but it's like you I mean maybe you
may make a bunch of money I mean one of the things like hand is cutting does it to a T especially if
you follow what CSI has said pretty pretty openly about the best way to get skunky line to express
skunky but it's not conducive to having skunky bud that you can carry around for a month and sell
it's just not gonna happen it's it's it's very very volatile compounds you know and and I think
it's obviously got a recessive trait and it's one of those things like people talk about people
don't know this about genetics or whatever but like I was talking about it the other night where
blonde hair and blue eyes is only like 11,000 years old in humanity yeah it's a mutation right
and it's a recessive so if you don't if both parents don't have the recessive you can't have
it so you go to like Nordic countries or something like that and there's a bunch of it but they say
eventually as people mix it's gonna get lost and it's almost never gonna pop up because there's
gonna the dominance are gonna be all over yeah and I think that's what happened is in the 90s
there was more there was more plants that both had the recessive and so it could pop and be and be you
know an expressive trait in those things and then as it got bred out and people lost it and it got
bred with other things it kind of became a recessive terp and then you're trying to look
for it to pop right and there's certain terpenes there's certain smells that are very dominant
terpene yeah yeah sure you know citrus you know you know a lot of times you can cross something
and something like 70 or 80 percent of its progeny will have had to have that aroma strong sure and
then other times there's stuff where it's only gonna pop up in a limited population you know so
for instance to use the human example if you've got a bunch of Nordic people mating right like a
bunch of Swedes or finish or whatever you get a bunch of blonde hair blue-eyed kids yeah but if
every generation they started like marrying Africans or Mexicans or Chinese or something
within a certain number of generations the blue eyes and blonde hair would go away or be a super
thing to catch up yeah you know and we haven't really studied which traits in cannabis are
recessive and dominant all we know we have we have no idea we just have observational data
yeah exactly shared amongst friends we don't have any scientific basis we just have observations
but if it was dominant it'd be easy to find yeah I mean not to and literally every single person
that has claimed that they were six or nine or twelve months away from releasing perfect skunk
to the community that was gonna change the game none of it has ever happened not yet no I mean
that was that was what that was Duke's claim to fame right when Dominion first came out he had a
huge skunk on the on all his shirts and he was you know he was six months away from walking in skunk
turps permanently from ancient skunk blue or sky Vienna all these different folks but then people
don't find it in the beans no it's hard and and the the best advice I'll even I'll even repeat it
for people that don't understand and don't know a lot of the reason you're not gonna see it is
because we grow weed so much differently we cure differently we dry differently how quickly wet
weed moves doesn't happen anymore you know like people don't you're not buying wet weed anymore
there's a lot lot different going on than was back then and if people kind of applied some of those
techniques to it you'd see it pop up very fast I also think too that all these techniques that
that he's talking about you can coke skunk out but I do believe that there was strains once upon a
time because people are talking about well maybe we were just confused no no I don't think that
it's just something that went away yeah through prohibition and people getting rid of it and
changing changing eras you know I mean imagine 20 years ago you're fucking growing a bunch of
skunk weed and it smells rank skunk and you're having a problem selling it and then your broker
buddy is like dude if you just grow this urkel you can sell every gram and so you stop selling
skunk yeah and you get rid of the skunk and you lose the skunk because you're growing urkel and
then you move on from urkel to frickin kush and then you move on from kush to sour and then you
move on to skittles and then somewhere ten years later somebody's like you know oh man I wish we
had some skunk but you got rid of that shit no one yeah never looked back and then it was like
not popular for long enough that when the time when everyone looked around and was like where to
go it was gone yeah people are asking when it showed up and I think I think most people agree
that whenever the Afghani started showing up in California is when the skunk started popping up
if you want to believe Sam skunk man he'll say that in the start of skunk one I post you know
that it popped up in most phenos that it was dominant that you didn't have to look for it
didn't matter if it was gross but who it was grown by where it was grown what nutrients you
use they came out skunky and it does seem when we interviewed Correll from super sativa seed club he
said the first skunk seeds that he got from Sam were much much much skunkier than what came later
yeah and Neville got those same seeds and you know I think the reason why the super skunk got lost is
because they lost the breeding male that threw those skunk turps you know and you know he they
used that skunk male you know and all kinds of stuff and so I think it was prevalent in the 90s
with a lot of those hybrids and then times changed and it was I mean I grew that that old school
super skunk right and you know some people call the skunk six and it really was scary yeah you
know it made around your house smell ridiculous for the last two weeks before harvest it was even
before you really had carbon filters were really sold yeah right so you'd have like the old like
you have an air like ozone generators yeah and you'd run it you'd run the ozone through like
30 40 feet of pipe and a coil and then you blow it out your house but I used to pull up in summer
and it smelled like dead skunks all around my house yeah it was scary you worry about your
neighbors you worry about getting in trouble you know people talk about it going through the bag
yeah right well what if it reeks like a dead skunk for 50 yards in every direction for your house for
two weeks out of every eight yeah that's sketchy people keep asking about shoreline we mentioned
a little bit ago I got to try outdoor shoreline and I thought it's pretty well-grown the person
who gave it to me said it wasn't but he's very humble and then I got to try some indoor from
bitter that he had grown and I got I I think it smells like hot garbage indoor and then outdoor
smelled a lot like real cat piss not terpene lean but real cat piss ammonia hot garbage so it's I
mean it just depends on what your definition of skunk is in my nose I put a lot of stuff up it
when I was young so I don't smell things certain smells I can't smell them I'm in a lot of stuff
that other people can so it's hard to say it's hard to say yeah I mean most of my most of my
friends one of the reasons why we we lost it was I couldn't get anybody to help me back it up yeah I
believe it yeah you know because people didn't want to grow it out it was risky and they were
making good money and growing other things yeah and that's how a lot of stuff will get lost is
like they'll be like oh well you know you can hold on yeah it's a lot of extra risk for not a lot of
extra bucks and then and then you're in the and then you're in the spot where it's like then it's
one bust or one fire or one mistake or one miss half away from losing it mm-hmm and then you start
trying to hunt it down you know somebody said the LA cushion chem D is pretty skunky that's good that
you found that I would not be surprised because I think both of those strains have super skunk in
them yeah I would not be surprised on some level to see somewhere in there those those genes combined
yeah and that kind of stuff to to come back up but you know it's a it's a numbers game you know
it's a numbers game breath someone asked about the hogs breath lineage it expresses very Afghan
you probably have some skunk one in it I mean it has like a depending on how you grow it slightly
cheesy just slightly sweet smell foot funk is probably my best description of it though other
people smell different things in it it was said to be Williams wonder to Northern Lights to a
Northern Lights back cross it was all kinds of different things people said but probably if I
had to guess and some sort of skunk one and all five maybe something Williams wonder maybe I don't
it's hard to say Afghani Afghani skunk one of some sort yeah so I mean it I think I think people
there's a lot better chance for people to find it in some random cuts like our buddies you know
panda that we were talking about yeah pop up it'd be another thing if that person could actually take
it that cut and then turn that into a line that people would you know with at least with a
reasonable level of certainty find some skunk in yeah because that's that's where it all falls
apart is to go like oh you're gonna get some skunk soon and then all the beans they sell people
don't find it yeah you know and you know so you know say you know and there's all kinds of people
saying oh I've got this oh I've got that oh I've got amazing things that'd be great if people did
but nobody's really popped up with it I mean we even had that that that asshole joint breath or
whatever he fucking went to he went to like one of those Colorado one of those Colorado cannabis
shows and he got skunk spray from whatever yeah and he went and got some skunk spray aroma from
from you know it's called tinks yeah from from the outdoor store you know hunting you know cabalas
or something and and and rubbed it all over his his jar yeah so that he could crack the jar and
be like you want to buy my seeds this is rank and then people would be like oh my god this just
stinks and then they go to smell the bud and they could and they it's like they could barely smell
it because only a little bit of it had gotten on there one of the people he let walk away with
some buds of it and in their bag was just this orange oil across the back yeah I mean that was
so sweet I gotta give props for actually doing that a lot of people joke about doing that but
that one actually that was actually he actually went for it yeah you know and and there's an
aspect to where you know they so yeah there's a bunch of people that have claimed it and I don't
like people talk about I do believe that there's a way to make some things express skunkier than
they do but I also believe that there was some there's some plants out there that have a straight
skunk notes I I find it hard to believe that anything after a full dry and after a full cure
is gonna smell super skunky I just don't think it can be captured like that based on what it is
that old cut had it 100% yeah even even like super far right rank yeah I mean it would only
last them I'll give you it would only last you know a month yeah I mean anything and then
eventually you're a driver but certainly like the first two three four weeks you had dry wheat of
it yeah it reeked unbelievably yeah 100% it didn't go away and so you know I uh you know
they I think it's out there but I think that the level of breeding required to lock it in is not
profitable enough to get people to actually do the work to make it all happen yeah and you know
have everybody grow the same way so it expresses the same way most because most breeding you know
there's some we have some friends like you know archive or Kayla CSI or you know there's Matt you
know we have some good friends that that that do multi-stage breeding but the vast majority of
breeding today is is one-offs and they move on to something else yeah it's not super there's not
they don't take something and and like they're like oh I'm gonna make this thing and then I'm
gonna grow out a thousand of them or 500 of them or 200 of them and select and rebreed and it's
almost all you know it's almost all one-offs ST you know reversals and one-offs right yeah I mean
how many people do you see finding stuff within their own work and then using that in further
work that's it's minimal minimal most most common for someone to be like I reverse this plant onto
these plants here's the names here's the packaging my next drop will be this other plant reversed
onto these other plants and yeah you know and so on and so forth so you know I mean RC archive on
here archive is one of the few people that it's like oh I got these phenos that I made from my
own stuff yeah and I'm gonna work with it Matt's done that you can watch CSI do it on his page
there's people that do it it's not as profitable and so trying to find someone that's really gonna
take all the failure involved to actually find our chaos is probably rare yeah man indeed indeed
okay let's do this get this giveaway ready so I'm just I literally picked just like four random
things one's a blue bonnet mix so this is a mixture of different whatever like females in a mixture
there's like 20 seeds in there or more mm-hmm one's a Durban Yeti fuel hybrid that I've released
is something called project fruit is just fruity and I'm not big on pretty but it was decent it
had good yield one is the narrow leaf Bubba what I don't know if it was really an s1 or if it was
fucking pollen katana probably Paul can down crossing the heirloom Afghan email and then the
old Calio cut cross to the Z cube skittles bx3 so we got to give this away to someone I don't know
how we're gonna do it yet so what matters and realizes I saved my Botox for there so it's
actually it's it's probably the best-looking part of you really so I think I have an idea I have an
idea so whoever gives whoever not so selects as the funniest response oh my god the to the given
for the strain called not those old balls so not those old balls what are the genetics in it whoever
has the funniest or best answer you'll get these for people it has to be someone in the USA that's
important because I'm not paying fucking 20 bucks to send you seeds it's not gonna happen the dumpster
still exists you know yeah it's not a hybrid the dumpster still exists yeah you know Cali Oh is
probably Cali Oh by skunk one yes that's that's probably what what's what realistic is realistic
you know yes wrote that's actually plant-based should win I mean he just said scrotox which
which yeah I don't know that might be that might be the winner yeah scrotox is gonna be hard to be
scrotox is really yeah boy yeah but yeah that's that's that's that's that's how they look so
smooth and young most people wasted up most people wasted on their face you know and on their forehead
and they try to work on these lines and stuff like that but yeah you know that that's that's
wasted there that is a total waste that's wasted you know so indeed indeed so they grab the names
that are gonna come in and you fuck me yeah oh yeah this is a good one I I think Joe cool said
scrotox first so Joe cool I think you're in the US so yeah Joe cool it is Joe cool hit me up after
I'll make sure these go to you and then maybe we're getting close we're getting close to the
end but maybe I'll do a rant oh yeah sure so we were we almost got to it earlier and then we got
sidetracked and and thrown not so firm is pretty good not so firm is also pretty good yeah but we
were talking about like people were asking a bunch of questions and you know and I think maybe just a
brief like sort of like what what people get with seeds has changed a lot yeah so I was just talking
now where it's like really what it boils down to is right now what you get is you get a lot of like
one-off hybrids that are sold and they exist until the guy runs out of stock and then they're gone
yeah that's that's that's most of the industry right now is one-offs but you go back 25 30 years
or something and that was not how things were most seed companies sold lines yeah okay and
there's a concept called you know what's your floor what's your ceiling right and what what
that is is that it's like is your seed line does it have a high floor which where most of them are
pretty decent but a low ceiling or you're not going to find any elites yeah or does it have
like a low floor where you could get some true junk and a bunch of mids but it actually has a
high ceiling where you could get some true elites mixed in there and people have this idea that in
the 90s and all that in Amsterdam like there was all this magical weed that's the weed that survived
yeah there was a lot of junk and there was a lot of mids right um and back then it was better than
Mexican so we people were a lot more forgiving of just random kind bud because all random kind
buds still sold because it wasn't so clone centric or anything like that right so you had a situation
where i don't know i don't know how i don't know how to say it i probably have bought 10 or 15 packs
of sensi and l5 haze in the mid 90s so that's probably i don't know it's over 100 seeds
yeah i didn't find an amazing keeper yeah but yet there's pith and cuban there's all these
different named phenos yeah from those exact same seeds that are still around 30 years later and
they're the fucking bomb and they're still like competing with today's strains and they're still
competing with today's strains and there's certain old strains you know that stand the test of time
and you know you might run through five or six well today as matt will tell you if you bought
three or four packs of matt's work and all you found was junk and not a single keeper you would
be fucking typing on your keyboard and making his life miserable because you'd be fucking pissed
so yes there's a lot of pressure today to have a high floor with your breeding so people will
get stuff that is decent enough that they won't bitch yeah and even back in the day 30 years ago
neville used to neville used to complain that he had these like you know afghan by afghan amazing
hybrids right like that he wanted to release but if people got 10 or 20 percent less yield than the
outcrosses they bitch up a storm yeah so breeders are always thinking about what will sell what's
feasible you have to right and so there's a lot of great weed that someone would be like this is
amazing weed but it herms yeah so i can't sell it because it'll be just endless memes about me
if you i mean all it takes is one customer posting one good picture of one single plant
herming even if it's in like you can tell the plant's all burnt up and it doesn't matter even
if they could show that one time it can ruin a line for good that's just how it goes you know
so there's a bunch of so there's a bunch of shit where if it herms it won't get released
if it's too leafy if it's too low yielding if it's too this if it's too that it won't get released
yeah right at least back in the day and so there was a lot of there was a lot of uh there was a
lot of strains that never got released that they thought were killer weed but they didn't meet
commercial standards yeah right and now weed has to be fucking pretty yeah cookies and all these
different hybrids have made ugly weed a really hard sell so what happens what happens if you
have some amazing tasting amazing effect kind of ugly weed that herms a little that weed is fucked
yeah you know like and they probably won't get released um but it's amazing but some pretty
some pretty mids that'll get released every time yeah you know the you know and and all that and so
um you know there's an aspect where it's like you know because more weed was accepted in the 90s
because it was better than mexican it allowed a wide variety of kinds of weed to flourish
yeah it it really allowed and and this whole naming of clone thing has led to the same same
getting grown by everybody and then that same weed gets crossed to everything and then everything's a
blend of kushmints and and kush and cookie and this and that and skittles and da da da da da and
you know and people talk about purple punch purple punch has everything but high
you know like that plant god damn yeah but there's so many mids and now that there's now that there's
modern marketing and everybody has to have white hot fire yeah there's i there's all these things
that i call midsy elites and then there's this thing where it's like if it's not an elite and
it's not junk and it's not mids what is it we don't even have a name for better than mids but
not quite elite yeah no we don't it's like junk mids elite yeah three-step process but there's
things that fall on that spectrum that don't have like i have weed that i really love and i'd be
super bummed if i lost it but i wouldn't consider it like in my top 10 or 15 cuts
yeah as far as like effect but i'd be super bummed if i lost it you know which one are you thinking
specifically right this second like the maui i knew it i knew it i knew it okay just because
just because of like if you were going to compare the maui's high yeah to say like my favorite high
is out there like an amazing nl5 hayes fino or chem 91 or chem d or the headband it's not as good
yeah but is it frosty and has amazing flavor and like you know throws nice purple chunks and
is a great yielder and like it has amazing features yeah but it's it's it doesn't have
an elite high you know what you know what's an interesting anomaly um among maybe instagram
weed today that i've noticed is the chem 91 because it's not exceptionally pretty it is
if you ask me it's exceptionally ugly most of the time it's very ugly it's very hard to take
good pictures of it and most of its value is in the high yeah and it's rare potency and it's rare
potency which is something you can't convey in pictures yet still today it's it sticks around
and there's enough people that say it's some of the best weed of all time yeah that there's group
think there and people want to try some of the best weed of all time yeah fomo for sure you know
but and a lot of times the when it looks the prettiest is the people that cut it way too early
in my opinion at like 53 or 55 days yeah if you take it the full 70 plus or something it looks more
ugly yeah but it works really good skunk va makes it look beautiful when he grows it and i i never
got it to look like that it was always just even when i try to shut it down on light hours like
lower light hours anything i would do would be endless white pistols burn up ass fucking leaves
it would just look hideous well you know one of the things i'll say and maybe i'll bring up like
some some totally random shit like crockett dna for a second yeah one of the things they did that
was really smart when they started selling all their strawberry banana and all those hybrids
and they were blowing up at emerald cup is they grew out greenhouses of that weed and then they
got professional photographers with really good equipment that understood lighting and understood
all that and color to come out and take jaw-droppingly beautiful shots and so that makes a
difference too like you might be sitting there and be like man i can't get a good picture of this
right because you're not and i do the same thing i'll be i'll take pictures of weed and i'll be
like i'm not that happy with it yeah you know but you get a professional in there and they're like
working on shutter speed and aperture and they know the lighting and they have this they have
the that and they'll make it look like a million bucks you know and so they were smart to like
pay for professional marketing yeah by getting professional photos sub cool was a master at that
and absolutely he had some of the prettiest fucking pictures back in the day didn't matter
that it was all space green you know it didn't matter it was just if he they look beautiful
humans humans are visual yeah you know humans are visual so i don't know we uh um
we're almost at nine o'clock here we actually bullshitted for a couple hours
