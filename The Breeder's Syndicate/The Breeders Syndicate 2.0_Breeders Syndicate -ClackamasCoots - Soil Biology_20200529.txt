How you doing? What's up, Glock? How y'all doing? How y'all doing? Yeah, people are
getting notifications today. I'm happy about that. So here we go. Here we go. So
hmm some of you may have heard. Oh first off, I just got to show this. Before I
even start in on this, let's go ahead and show this. Let's go ahead and show this.
Oh God, my ugly head cut it off. This is joint breath relishing in the fact that
Duke got popped. So you know, just by whatever your views on anything are.
He's stoked he can go sell cuts that he doesn't even have of the puck which is
mids. Trash, but yeah. It's always interesting when people people have that
point of view. So when people come in and ask what my problem is with joint
breath, this is it all summed up in one. Yep, that is it's just about as
offensive as you can get. Anyway, so I was looking up some shit and I noticed
there's a story about this dude in Kauai. A dude in Kauai. What's his name?
Justin Britt. Apparently he got sued for he got sued for embezzling and that you
know that happens all the time. Pieces of shit and bezel and steal from each
other and all that shit. You know a bunch of noobs trying to get into the fucking
medical cannabis business. There's a better shot of the guy right there.
Is that Keanu Reeves? No. You know who it is? This dude's brother. This dude's
brother. And the only reason I don't feel bad about this is because this dumbass
decided to put his real name up on High Times. This is super kawaii by the way.
Yeah he's a this is super here. So people also want to know what the deal is on
super kawaii. So he showed up I don't know five years ago maybe claiming that
his his dad made Krippy or someone made Krippy. You know I don't know you know
but you know saying his dad went to jail did all time that his dad's a fucking
thing. Oh no no your dad did not go to jail did he buddy? Did he? Did he? Anyway it's
just he needs to know that I mean just because we don't unload on the dude we
don't really unload on nobodies you know. But at least now he knows now he knows
that we know. Now he needs to shut his fucking mouth or shut him down. So yeah anyway I
thought that was cute. This fucking ugly ass head. Fucking meth is a fucked up
drug. Can't forget his dancing roots.
So this is purely for science.
But I want you to see something here.
Do you see those little things moving?
Do you see those little things moving?
He said that fucking roots are moving to Bob Marley.
Holy shit. Anyway any fucking way what are you guys up to?
No no no one got busted in that.
Supa's never done time. His dad's never done time. I mean I don't care. I don't
doing time doesn't make someone special to me. It doesn't you know I mean people
get popped every now and then that happens it's a shame but he uses it as
like a flex right but it's always weird when people that's not what happened and
you're flexing with it like you know yeah street cred stories and it's just
not gonna happen bro not gonna happen there's no street cred for you Supa.
No street cred for you. Anyway yeah I just thought that shit was funny.
I thought it was funny you know. I unloaded on Mass Medical the other day so I
figured I'd unload on his stupid ass too. So what you guys got? What kind of
stuff we got today? What kind of questions you got? Hey what seeds can I
pop with some old Stella Blue flavor? We had a blue baby shit version too
that is essentially that Stella Blue the same same fucking turnt profiles the
Stella Blue. Yeah that's the guy behind 808 yeah yeah he told he was he saying
he's never heard of me before and then he called me a fat methadone something
rather. Yeah Clack. You know I mean a lot of people tell on themselves and that's
how they get caught they want to brag those who don't don't get caught
sometimes. What's up? Want to give me a BJ tonight? Yeah babe. Of course I'll take a BJ. Oh you mean the
restaurant yeah that too. Yeah that too I'll take both. Thank you. What a woman.
What a woman. Not feeling good and still gonna go down. Breeder Steve is on future
cannabis project now live. Oh that's cool. Can you get them or do you have the
blue baby shit version too? I do I do and I know you're a Stella Blue fan so yeah
hit me up. A bazooki. Do they have bazookis there? I want a fucking bazooki. BJ's is good.
Happy wife yeah that's for sure. The opposite definitely true too. Let me see
what else I got. I know I have some other prized things some some I cannot
show some I cannot show. I wish I could show all you show you all this shit that
I got on this dude. Fucking hilarious hilarious. I'm not big on doxing folks
but when someone puts their their first and last name in a high times ad they
kind of just are what are you doing? No not very smart right. BJ tastes like BJ's.
Yummy extra yummy. Die or that. Anyway what else we got in here? Yeah please do
Stella. Drop it to me here on Riot Seed Co. I never check the other ones. There
was a blue baby shit version one which was the it was a Stella Blue BX and then
we have the blue baby shit version two and that one it's not it has no Stella
Blue in it but it is based on that type of thing. Genetic drift is a myth. Yeah I
think acclimation is real as far as something drifting genetically there's
such thing as epigenetics that affects stuff but nothing is ever gonna drift
genetically ever ever you can't it just doesn't happen genetics don't drift like
that. Acclimation is a real thing which is why you can see the chem 91 cut
fucking blown out fucking or really beautiful looking you know there's a few
different ways to grow that same with the puck and other cuts. Yeah see what
else funny shit we got. What other questions you guys got? We have Clack in here so we
can actually ask soil question you know I don't ever answer soil questions
cuz I'm not a soil guy but it'd be nice. What else do we got? Spincing some pretty
pictures from my buddy. The P. Can you explain the Uncle Fester cut? Okay there
is no Uncle Fester cut for real that is a myth by a nature fraud nature farmer
hmm that that started back with what's his name I got a headache right now so
I'm trying to think it's a what's his fucking name the dude who said he made
Tahoe that fucking idiot Master Tai he was the one that started all that shit
about like oh it's skunk 18.6 or 18.8 blah blah blah I have this it's fucking
rare yeah it's not and he was a liar too he never made Tahoe like it's just
one liar after another trying to build up on shit they don't have and really
people bragging about skunk one hmm skunk 18 that's exactly what I'm talking
about there is an original skunk 18 but it is it's gone like that's not ever
been something in circulation I'm a chieva skunk you know I don't know on
that one I haven't talked to him about it and I you know I don't like to say
someone doesn't have something absolute if if I don't know for sure you get one
amendment to your soil what would it be there's a good one
clack if you're still in here if you could add one amendment to your soil
what would it be I have not heard of ginseng oh gee that's new to me what's
up Sun grow is there a particular strain that changed my life financially
I would have to give all credit to organ kid in the banana OG as far as
financially the clockwork orange of course there you go kelp mill kelp mill
that's your answer from clack he's very experienced with that so I'd say that's
pretty good advice all right yeah clockwork and in banana og like a banana
og help me it's something that I used a lot and it did really well for me I
can't take any credit for the banana og stuff that really was someone else's
doing it was already good when it got to me I've been having trouble though can
we I can't tell if this is male or not maybe you guys can help me figure it out
I've been trying to sex this plant I've kept meal not seaweed extract black
powder there we go I've been trying to sex this for a few
days and I just can't figure it out what else do we got here thanks thanks to all
heart for that one too good too good see fully erect felt ready to blow
there's that fucking p-picture that I had there it is look at that look at
that shit mm-hmm that's the p91 s1 for bitter his selection of it lay down lay
down Murray definitely not cookies our me and coma is still good I mean yeah I
mean I have no reason to be shit-talking coma at all we just disagree on some
things but nothing bad another person asking about create fuck have you ever
seen the dude and his tooth is one tooth that was you that was all you what's up
mr. Vitus create yeah I mean if if you like a little side of meth with your
seeds create would be awesome do I know of any crosses made with a hawk and I
think black pack is doing something with a wahaken of some sort I know Bodie's
done some wahaken crosses a blueberry has wahaken in it somewhere yeah see
keeping on and on knows what's up it's up roots thoughts on boneyard I like
boneyard I like him a lot I like Tony quite a bit he's one of the few people
like all heart that always inspires me to be a better person you know he's been
through a lot lost one of his legs yeah all right is a beast but but Tony he's a
he's a special dude and he keeps fighting does honest genetics live up to
his name dude if you have to put honest in front of the your name you're trying
to sell something that you aren't that's all I gotta say with that
well Hawkins beer circa 76 see I'd love to see some nice wahaken nowadays I
wouldn't know what I'm too young to have known wahaken never knew Hindu Kush was
actually an area till last night yeah the Hindu Kush mountain region mountain
range next Disa I had a mechsa milia I forgot who did that one but it was
really good too what form of silicon can be added to soil without jacking up
pH and does it need it I don't know about amending with silica but I like
the ortho silicic doesn't jack the pH too much what about the RKS from blue
sky guy oh lord look dude and you know I mean some people are new to this and
whatnot but you have got to be just a little bit suspicious of that dude when
nobody's grown it nobody's seen it the only one pumping it is him on 90
different names yeah it's that dude is something else man something else
another guy that's lying about shit like I actually put up screenshots of what
old-timer one said about his skunk line the skunk one line and that's what this
dickhead keep saying is his RKS and you know I mean all time one himself said
that it was not skunky so yeah ever since then he's been writing my dick
pretty hard yeah roots let's see it can clackamas breakdown add still 16 versus
some height like aptus or power si yeah add still versus xl 16 versus like power
si man I want to say I used to add still I didn't have any results like I did
with the power si to be honest
tropic trees why would you tell you can't when you're tagging super quiet
for we already we already done been over that little bitch this guy oh and I
don't know if he ever says he is pop but just in case no you ain't ever
fucking been been popped so just in case he tries to ever pull that one we already
know that the answer to that did you hear the GGG interview no I don't give
a fuck what GGG says fucking flatter if they're anti-vaxxer fucking idiots your
neighbors children oh no I hope you don't have like an idiot like we do it
was a pre Sam Cal there's no such thing as a pre Sam California skunk I mean
when you're depends on what I mean rephrase that there's no such thing as a
pre Sam California skunk one that doesn't exist before Sam skunky weed did
exist before Sam that was just Afghani they had nothing to do with skunk one
yeah hey yeah clap you want to come on
shit I'll bring him on yeah dude there we go see if it works we get this
picture off here it'll probably mess up bring super I would never bring super in
here I don't get super quiet exposure how you doing
yeah you don't answer that question and it comes up almost every so-called
liquid silica product is made from potassium silicate and that's where your
pH issues come into play or problems with raising the pH so we we can get it
from other sources a couple of the posters here mentioned rice halls and
that's true there's even a powdered rice whole product that build a soil
carries I can't remember the name but I've used it and it did well one person
asked a very legitimate question is it even necessary and it depends like in my
worm bins I run a lot of rice holes as an aeration material so on that
deconstruct is releasing the silica oxide I believe that's the form it's in
so would I add it to my soil no but you know so that question isn't you need
some silica in your soil and if you use it judiciously and get like the egg cell
product because that's what all the other ones like the silly one from the
guy advanced nutrients wet Betty or some silly yeah even a sillier label but
uh it's made from egg so I mean all those products that you see in the
grocery store or what I call the house of tradition they're all made with eggs
so get egg still yeah and then cuts a chase and it's in a powder form so you
mix on a as-needed basis and it's good for emulsifying horticulture oils I
don't want to get into that mess neem or well there whatever but uh yeah and I
still use them and they're full of crap the people you know yeah you gotta learn
the difference between an extract and a pressing but you know that's like trying
to explain why is it called unsalted and not desulfur molasses and if you can't
wrap your brain around that one then I don't want to talk to you about the
differences between an extraction and using solvents and a pressing that goes
back at least 2,000 years I'll get off my soap how do you feel about how do you
feel about like like power SI the ortho salicylic acids and and monosalicylic
acids I'm sorry hold on a second let me turn my sound up excuse me it's all
right good question how do you feel about ortho salicylic acid and
monosalicylic acid stuff that's not from potassium silicate you know to be honest
with you I'm a real minimalist if you looked at my recipe the biggest
criticism is well there's no there there well it's all in the worm castings you
know I don't look I think everybody should recycle their kitchen waste if you
don't do that you should have to be forced to listen to some TV show that's
really horrible or something but it's not going to give you a worm castings
there's too much water and as many as those worms are they can't turn water
into castings yeah you need bulk and that comes from either aged manure and
by that we mean five to six weeks to allow the vermicides that are given
livestock for like we do dogs you worm them yeah well those vermicides kill the
good guys in our worm bins you need to let that sit for about five to six weeks
and they'll degrade into a form into its basic ionic structure if that makes
sense yeah so it's no longer a vermicite it's carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and
all those good things so so we want to use that that gives us bulk and that's
how you make good casting it's through bulking yeah well yeah there's some I'll
leave it yes good good bedding it's been elevated with nutrient-dense materials
like small amounts of alfalfa meal help meal I like to run neem and Karanja this
might you might find interesting Karanja is actually a legume it's closer to a
alfalfa plant than it is the neem tree which is a mahogany in the properties in
those two materials couldn't be more different there's no shared constituent
as a direct income from neem and pangamia oil comes from Karanja I'm not
familiar with Karanja what what what is that used for well in India is the
preferred one for medicines for skin products and India has some of its own
race issues the beliefs that lighter colored citizens are more intelligent
than darkness said to be used to lighten the skin tone I know that it
can all but if you look if you went into an Indian market and went to the havas
section everything would have either neem or Karanja and you know shampoo
toothpaste but over here if you get touched with name you're gonna fall
over dead or something or you know you can't go to the Rose Parade or something
but I mean if you looked at the Ayurvedic medical system you know you
have the TCM traditional Chinese India has the Ayurvedic and 72% of the
bottled compounds you know elixirs and stuff 72% have some part of the neem
tree root bark leaf oil and it's behind the Tulsi basil which is a forerunner of
all basils like the wolf is to the canine friends well this one okay it's
the most holy plant in India is the Tulsi and then neem is the second one
so anyway at all look up the some time in research CA is nothing to do with
gardening nothing okay it's all about human health diabetes viruses all kinds
of things you can rub the oil on your feet as a cure or a prevention of
athletes but if you do a lot of running or you know so yeah it's been around for
5,000 years but suddenly 18 months ago became a you know point of discussion at
Canna con and yeah endo Expo you know it's just you know whatever all this is
appreciated there's people asking all kinds of questions
oh no worries no worries I'm enjoying it um let's see why my why is my worm casting
running hot and sodium and then and you think I can push out sodium with calcium gypsum
no because gypsum is simply wait a minute Oh calcium sulfate and it's calcium in its
elemental form whereas the calcium we get and say limestone or oyster shell that's calcium
calcium carbonate so there's one calcium ion there's one carbon ion and then three oxygen
ions in calcium carbonate but in this in gypsum you're getting calcium by itself and then you
get sulfur oxide which is water soluble yeah and so what and like let's say you're using core
one thing that has to be you know acknowledged is that it's an inert medium that's why it's
preferred if you're going to use salts but in a organic soil it's a nightmare yeah what you want
to do the big one that's missing is sulfur and without sulfur sulfur is at the base of almost
every metabolical function on this planet including the production of terpenes terpenoids
and ketones so it'd be a really good I have your red I'm using corn I can't get any of flavor and
I don't get any aroma okay put a half a cup of gypsum you know and say a cubic foot and there
you go you're dancing yeah yeah that's something I had to learn on my own to to add add sulfur yeah
kind of sulfur to to because I use core that's all I use right so I like a mix I like to add in a
calcium carbonate like limestone or oyster shell doesn't matter the same thing and then a little
bit of gypsum so I'm getting my own mental calcium along with my calcium carbonate and then I'm also
picking up some gypsum so I think that's that's a good balance if you I don't like using this term
but a liming agent if you will yeah for lack of better one okay we have a request here on the
history of the strain the one which is what I've been fascinated with for a long time myself okay
pretty simple in Laguna Beach in the late 60s and early 70s before the whole LSD the orange
thing took him apart it's one thing to taunt a dog behind the fence with a stick but you don't
want to do that with a federal government yeah that's especially when you're moving in containers
containers yeah okay those are like 48,000 you know I mean these guys weren't just a dude we
ever see the dude and get some stash tonight you know this is like you know you got like even then
10 kilos to even communicate but anyway so the seeds came in a lot of the guys because they're
in the BOL there was like it had to be 13 right 13 original founding members yeah that was a
good one okay yeah and so seven were part of this ragtag motorcycle club that used to hang out there's
really weird bar not far from Disneyland and they were just you know drinkers and you know like rowdy
bikers it was the 60s man so there was also this group of surfers in the mid 60s that were traveling
around the world as it was easy to do maybe easier than today and when surfing in the surfing spots
all had somebody there with good weed so they started bringing some good weed back because they
knew how to patch their boards so they can make a hole in the board and stash in a pound or two
and so that's then the two got together and then the whole thing so the seed that I had were from
Kandahar 1970 and I know exactly who brought him in the whole story okay so then I went off to the
army got drafted him kicking and screaming to send the women and children first but off to save the
world make it safer democracy I came back in in December of 1976 the first tie sticks came in okay
and I came in 10 kilo bales and they were wrapped in I'm sorry yeah 10 kilo yeah 22 pounds right yeah
okay yeah so 20 of those pounds were sticks and since Amiya was still two or three years away so
they were seedy is all get out and there was in two pounds of loose buds that of course had to be
renamed the Buddha buds yeah yeah I've heard of that yeah okay so those seeds became the first
crop I ever did that summer in 77 and there was no growth stores there was no new program I don't
know I'm sure he would know what to do if I had a bottle of maxi or miracle grow or whatever you
know yeah but I understood that you had to water plants so and that was before the banking laws you
could walk into a car dealer and buy four sellicas if you want and pay cash and it was no big deal
yeah later in the Reagan administration like you know yeah just say no that crowd so so that was a
female and there were 10 plants that were selected out of this mass I'm not a breeder so if I told you
guys be laughing so this was like flying by the seat of my pants just be reliant about it you know
well that's early on though no one was really oh there were no seed companies and the guys in yeah
California were chilled dinking around with goofy names you know yeah I had a couple but I would have
name that's another story um so that one the way it got the name was that they were all against the
wall and they went from sativa over to Afghani dominant yeah I had no interest in at all so I
just said okay the one over here is mine and so oh so it's like the one huh no it's like the one
okay so that became a running joke you know it's still got the one yeah still got the one and so
that's just like you know it has nothing to do as I thought it was like oh yeah it's like the one no
I've had the one that came from Sri Lanka and I didn't want to ever smoke weed again it was like
that far out you know it's like yeah some Hindus I mean real Hindu not you know you picked it up in
New Delhi I mean like in the Kush Valley or something you know from the side yeah so that's
all there you know no big deal and but ironic is that I've given that way I've never sold a cone
in my life the last time I sold a seed was 77 that's early that is early yeah the tea Thai seeds
you know because I had them yeah I learned early on that if I was going to take the risk of being
a serious consumer of cannabis that you might as well do the good stuff so I would sell like I know
you can't I'm not but say I would get fronted like a ton or two of Columbia from guys in Detroit with
way too many valves in their last name they'd give you like two months to turn it yeah so our motto
was I don't want to own it I just want to fingerprint it meaning you know bump it 25 30
bucks yep and just keep it you know so I would turn around and go by like premium Mishma Khan or
your Haka Oh Hakan spirits were personal and you went to Sears got a deep freezer so I could freeze
it you know so I could buy a fear of four pounds you know that kind of stuff that's fucking awesome
yeah so that was and you know can I just say one thing about skunk number one sure I mean going
back to the like original in the mid 80s yeah I don't get it what do you mean as far as like
why it's called skunk in the first place I you know it's like I just don't get the whole thing
about it I mean why like it's that desirable oh okay now I understand that one okay I can I can
understand that one okay it's like yeah yeah well my favorite somebody will give me a bud to try
what do you think now I say so did you clone this more than twice why yeah it's made it through
rounds but yeah I mean yeah come on one nice thing about growing an old stream is that you
really can test the soil because you can't test the soil oh this time I'm gonna do I don't know
skittles or piddles or whatever it's called right yeah okay and then you over here well I'm gonna
try this or but I'm gonna use I know cookies or whatever yeah thing is you know whatever the hot
button is but with me I mean I can tell you by day 24 I'm not gonna finish this I appreciate you
let me try it but you know yes wishes go back to the drawing board so that and so in my opinion
which means nothing is that at least if I test something for you I can give you an accurate
comparison analysis of one that I've you know grown like forever yeah the main reason people
don't like mine is that if you really want to get the full you know Twilight Zone team comes on
right here you got to do at least 12 if not 14 weeks and here's the best part this is the part
I love the best I've taken at 18 weeks just to see what it would take to get the trikes to turn
even cloudy it doesn't ever happen never so you're never gonna get the amber forget that one all
right yeah let alone cloudy no it never goes cloudy even outdoors like seven months where you
like Southern California where you can take it through November into December yeah it never
goes cloudy that's it has to be the Highland tie that has to be I would think so maybe if you tried
like way less light hours like six hours light oh yeah oh yeah I still didn't do it over the years
I've done every I was ignorant got into that well you know you need this bulb yeah yeah right this
bulb will make it finish yeah huh this bulb will make it finish yeah yeah right yeah yeah
but anyway that's that's my you know just a guy that decided to get into soil real serious and
figure out I have post on my IG feed of a soil test that I mixed five years ago and it has all
the NPK it has all the macro and micro nutrients and you know we're a little weak in the micro
so what throw some kelp in there that's why kelps the perfect one because it's a plant right and it
accumulates all 83 elements more importantly in the right battle if we don't go nuts that's adding
some kelp will take care of all our micronutrient issues Wow I didn't even know that it's the only
brown kill makes sense not not blue marine algae not red but green I mean green red but brown only
brown is the only organism on this planet that creates algenic acid and I'll leave you for
research on that but you can see why brown kelp house algenic acid seaweed extract is created by
by law under federal USDA regulations has to be created with either a sodium hydroxide or potassium
hydroxide the stuff they use in Drano to clean out your drain so they use that and they burn
everything off so what are you left with you're left with powder you got your elements you might
as well just do salts see what I mean yeah all the life force is gone yeah but it's convenient
but a convenience that is detrimental to your soil in my opinion I don't want to put a fungicide in
my soil after I've spent several months building up the nutrient yeah and fungal profile and my
compost before ever hit a warm bin um can I ask you are you self-researched and you just you just
delved into a hardcore and learned it all on your own or you are you oh no no I'm academically yeah
I was gonna say this is pretty pretty heavy academic stuff yeah but the real stuff is that
you have to do it you have to get your hands on dirty there's no solution there's hey it's it's
hard work and if you want to have scratches in the game you got to do it and be consistent don't
don't be my phone could we release my product today oh good the one was malted barley multilayer
heirloom corn and hemp seeds and where can people get this Oh build a soil it's called don't laugh
I named it I want to sound cool gnarly barley gnarly barley yeah 50% barley and it's 30% corn
that's where the cytokines yeah and then the hemp which I could spend a couple days explaining all
the enzymes and compounds oh you know from it kind of goes like this if it works good on a plant it's
probably good for you and vice versa that's interesting the benefits from the hemp seed and
all all multi means means nothing more than this it means that you took a seed and you germinated
it and then you arrested at about a hundred and sixteen Fahrenheit but that does it leaves the
enzymes intact so we call that diastatic malt now if we take that malt after it's dried and
ready to store use and we caramelize it for flavor or aroma for ales and what have you that's great
but it kills all the enzymes so now we call that non diastatic malt and if you use non diastatic
in your beer formula then you need to add the diastatic malt because you can't make beer without
amylase is the main player enzyme in the barley but that's not what we benefit from can I explain
this because this is really important yeah but okay so all plants produce chitinase and chitin
itself is an acetyl form of glucosamine okay all seashells contain are made up from limestone or
calcium carbonate okay okay but the crustaceans the the crab the lobster the shrimp and I guess
that would also include the one in the south crawdads yeah have chitin and chitin for example
you had surgery either oral or external they probably sewed you up with chitin string okay
and that goes back to like the 1880s this has really got an interesting connection so in 1922
this young man by the name of Albert Hoffman graduates from Cologne University and his paper
is on the molecular structure of chitin and then 21 years later he would introduce or find LSD 25
and then 15 years after that he was commissioned to do the research on these mushrooms out of
Oaxaca and he's the one that gave the name to the two compounds psilocybin and psilocin so in a 15
year period here he does LSD 25 read his book LSD my problem child there you go write it down
guys book and then anyway so the only thing that can deconstruct microbially that can deconstruct
a polysaccharide is fungi bacteria and their weak attempt to try to deconstruct it create an enzyme
called chitinase and chitinase deconstructs eggshells in the soil so that's kind of cool
you don't have to get it always yeah yeah and then equally important animal kingdom and plant
kingdom have immune systems and in plants you have like H a hormonal acquired resistance and
systemic acquired resistance and some of them are called pathways the most important pathway
in a plant's defense system is the chitinase salicylic acid pathway okay and every plant
produces salicylic acid some plants produce copious amounts like the aloe vera plant okay
probably hurting your career oh you can use willow shoots oh yeah okay well that's all
silica acid okay and so that's why people would use aloe vera that's what I know it started that
I'm not climbing a tree I go to a Mexican market yeah fresh aloe vera leaf and you just cut off
the spiny stuff on the sides and you stick your stems in there inside the jail let it sit overnight
next day put them in how are you I don't want to get into that one but how do you do your cuts yeah
and that salicylic acid creates a barrier against pathogenic fungi your molds and all that I average
seriously over 98% success using just that I don't or the best actually the best one is even find true
like the sign on the side of the road that says honey so it's never been touched yeah it's just
you straight honey is straight how do you do yeah I had no clue about that yeah it's really cool but
you got to get organic because what they do to honey from the time they pull it from the beehive
till it gets in that jar with a little bear you know let's not yeah it's a sad story you know it's
you know yeah but anyway so that's why if we use malted grains in our soil the chitinase you don't
have to go through the expense of using crab meal because what you're really after is the
chitinase not the chitin yeah here you get it right in the malted grains along with your a's
protease protein phosphatase what cannabis grower doesn't obsess about phosphorus right yeah much
of their peril usually yeah right yeah but you get the idea I mean so there's like 360 enzymes in a
malted grain so what I can do and have done is I can document okay here are the end you can take
not from under your fingernail and put it water and say it's got enzymes yeah okay but I can
explain each one and how they work and I'm only taking like 10 out of the 360 that are in barley
so and then you add corn to the cytokines and what that does to between the tip of the root system
and then the Mary stem at the end of the branches is quite a phenomenal study and the first cytokine
and was discovered in corn in 1937 in the Latin name for corn is Zia so they named this enzyme
zeatine make sense yeah so that's and there's other there's other PTRs and other things in
the corn besides that one enzyme excuse me a hormone yeah so anyway I was just thinking
botany 101 probably bored your audience there but no no I think everybody's fucking loving it to be
honest with you I love it I'd love to have you on anytime you are bored want to come on I know
it's a real treat for me and everyone else so I really appreciate it because I like talking to
gardeners instead of salesmen you know yeah it's a pleasure and an honor to have you look at my
feed your what my feet yeah okay yeah I see some of the plants yes okay that one at ten and a half
pounder yes don't you think it's a little disingenuous to come on my feet and tell me
what I should be doing oh my good lord yeah no that's everybody's a scholar in botany right
yeah I want to say is maybe like do more reading and not so much editorial stuff you know till you
kind of I figured I've been involved in at least yeah at least 300 325 serious gardens in my career
yeah I imagine so did hey the first slice ever bought was some George oh yeah it was called
George Avanti's then before he became Jorge oh yeah yeah a place here in Portland it was one of
three growth stores in Portland at the time that was it and we went and bought these Dutch lights
from PL light systems okay I mean the professional stuff I was gonna burn down my house in Orange
County California trying to grow some weed so we decide there was you know funding was available
I'll leave it at that so yeah we decided to set it up first cabin and I was using what do you call
them Oh dosatron 30 years ago that's funny yeah and buying like full jugs I think there were five
gallons you have dyna grow and dyna bloom we'd write down to there was some in the Bay Area like
San Jose something like that yeah and so we just put the dosatron inside the jugs and then I did
this drip system I mean by today's standard you guys got it made I mean it's all off the shelf
and plug and play for the most part you know we had to kind of like huh so how are we gonna do
this oh yeah which I like one time pulling stuff out of the field and staging it next to the pickup
trucks and the guy that was like our leader I called him op8 our personal hero in this case
I just ate some dick have you given a thought where you're gonna dry this and everybody just
down at the ground like man and we were using bull tacos to go back into the forest to get
the plants where I'm bringing back and stage them you know so yeah I know he's friends with some of
the Northern Lights crew did you interact with those guys at all no not at all because that
out of what they called the BCGA the British Columbia Growers Association and the NL came
out of Canada on a guy that broke the BCGA wasn't going to do business with any of the two groups
that came out of Holland though what is now called since he seeds then it was called the SSC and then
Neville and his partner yeah so yeah they wandered around and everybody had cash you know
yeah briefcases full of cash and they were buying seeds and cuts so I bet northern light came out
from a grower in Canada that said hey man you know yeah you cut hay with the sunshine you got
money I'm selling so that's how the NL thing went over to Neville's deal the seed bank that was
the only thing about seeds in my life I bought on one time Hayes Northern Lights and did you find
any keepers in it did you find good stuff in it I never bought another seed again in my life that
I you know every story I hear about old older growers that were growing the Northern Lights
in a Tay Day they all have very very fond memories and they talked about how many keepers were found
that became like one of them clone only that are still around nowadays well there is a caveat to
my comment I want to make this is really important here's where you're getting conflicting things in
a case that I was indirectly I wasn't involved but I was on the possible list of come talk to us
back in Boston and in discovery it came out that the DEA and the US Postal Service was intercepting
letters from the seed banks to customers here and they were switching it out with ditch weed seeds
oh this was in discovery this is what they yeah came to the you know here's our evidence evidence
they call it I'm not an attorney but yeah they all sit around before they do launch or something and
you said how they're gonna screw you yeah yeah so I mean that just like it clicked but have you ever
noticed how many times in your life you've been back in the forum day before to social media
like I see mag or grass you know that people go home they sure my plan sure don't look like the
pictures from the seed bank yeah I just used to think I don't want to open this can of worms
man I just know hey I'll be I'll be hated on forever for spilling that one oh yeah you're
gonna realize their collections worthless and then they're gonna really dislike the messenger
yeah yeah yeah exactly so but no that's honest to God I was like I just went well that parties
over you know so let's go back to square one and we know because we know who brought him in
the United States and the whole history and who who had possession of them and everything else so
I don't have a lot of confidence but I one greeter here that a farm or whatever they call him gave me
13 samples in those little jars with you know yeah probably hold I don't know half a grant or
half an author's it had them all gorilla glue Girl Scout cookies this today this yeah I put
them in a bag I brought them home they were gonna hire me as a consultant and so my wife's in a
kitchen cooking dinner and I sat down in the living room and I opened one up and I smelled
that one guy that's really terrible but you know you never know so yeah pull out a noog and I busted
it up and I put it my pipe and I got half a hit and I just put it down it's ridiculous my wife
comes around the corner she goes what's that smell and I said oh it's and I don't want to name it
because I'll get you know yeah it's one that everybody has to have or you're just a complete
dickhead right if you're not growing this one you're a dickhead okay yeah and I just said and
so I you know I was really polite but I said I just don't see any connection I mean what are we
gonna do like we do your soil I mean there's this more issues here than I can even yeah I
need like the biggest spreadsheet known to God to even get into the site so why this thing's
so yeah I wish you the best and sure enough one season was over that was the first year
it went legal here there's funny money everywhere from Asian banks from European banks I mean it
was insane and who did they hire a growth store clerk that that's your grow guy really oh good
you need another Cal Mag lockout and handle this one you know yeah there's no there's no purpose
in consulting for someone that's gonna hire idiots all along the side of you to perform you
know complex shit yeah and I'm and I'm enough of an egotist and a clown I just don't tolerate
fools lightly I mean hey go do whatever you want I wish you the best you know instant karma whatever
you know yada yada yada but I'm here to grow real medicine yeah exactly I'm not here to the whole
industries like that to the whole hemp industry I just made my entrance into the hemp industry
last year and I was shocked at how many people are playing grower in that I really thought I
never fucked with it because I figured there are people that are that are better than I would be
at doing it because they've been studying specifically hemp longer working with it
longer I figured they had that shit fucking dialed in and boy was I confused when I got
in there and saw the people are just playing constantly playing hmm I don't know oh I know
wild world without you know proprietary this and I can't tell you that and you know I mean
exactly about it this way the issues facing a human race isn't whether Johnny gets his
on is how are we gonna feed people and if this crap work they'd be sitting in front of the UN
picking up checks for billions of dollars on solving world hunger right right I mean to me
it it's that simple it is that simple so that's why like on my new product I'm donating percent
of my compensation to an agency that plants forest around the world so that's beautiful I just think
hey I want everybody get their dank on it in it some like new line I want to do a line called
coots newts spell that's with n o t s coots newts you know and I'll just say look this is what you
want I'm feeding I'm feeding your your deal man your Dharma you whatever it is you think you have
