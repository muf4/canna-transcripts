the idea for this from another youtuber named Jesse on fire and I felt like it
was a fair it was fair for him to ask so I figured I'd do the same. Honor system
reengaged in cannabis. Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0 where we explore the
history of a clandestine scene researching everything from cannabis
strain history old smuggling tales from the first-person perspective to breeding
science and news on current subculture. I'm your host Matthew and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie Natsu Dog breeder and grower from
Mendocino to speak on these subjects and sometimes interview other participants.
Our goal is to document this history before it's written by corporations and
others who just weren't there. Let's start righting some wrongs. Welcome to
the underground. Hey everyone welcome to Breeder Syndicate this is going to be
part two of the Mad Jagger Raho series and of course joined here by my friend
Natsu Dog. Peace everyone. So yeah everybody we really had a good time
recording the show last time I think it was probably the largest response we've
ever gotten for any show as far as the positive positivity that we received it
really really resonated with a lot of people and yeah I'm really excited to
start with round two so to speak. We tried to go in a more linear pattern and
we covered some of the the Canyon era but I know we after after we recorded
last time we spoke a little bit and you have some notes and a good direction so
I'm gonna let you go ahead and start Mad Jag where do you want to start the tale?
The 1978 map that I drew it says OG stands for original garden. There we go
here's the 1978 map if you want to explain it a little bit and break it
down. The key is at the bottom this is before before skunk number one this is
the very first we had a friend in Kauai who who had Oaxacan Hawaiian crosses
yeah and they're the h10 h9 hk and then we had somehow some a few Thai seeds I
don't know where they came from the Colombian came from my friend and they're
the ones that on Thanksgiving while it was snowing above us on the rim what
weren't even close to being finished so this was the layout of that garden that
you showed photos of last time that's right let's end so well it's surrounded
by pine trees and lots of heavy dark green brush this garden was probably I'm
thinking 100 feet long and 50 feet wide it that was the size. This is from the
old notebooks that you have? It was just drawn like at the time you were drawing
this as you were looking on or how did it work? That's amazing it's absolutely
amazing just all of them every year I did one this was at the middle part of
our Canyon the subsequent years 80 79 80 and 81 were about two or three miles
further up the canyon okay this one so this one was closer to 1,800 feet down
it was a longer hike more difficult and the others were anywhere from 14 to 1600
feet down in Wow which makes a difference at the end of the year of
course when you're carrying it this here your harvest out that's why we did as
much as possible down inside the canyon later by having friends come down in and
camp with us because it wasn't feasible to carry out whole plants or branches or
anything like that did you find that any of these grew any different in these
little micro climates in the canyon like any of these strains from like 78
between 78 and 79 if you moved or grew any of the same exact strains in
different little locations in the canyon did you find any phenotypic
variations I don't really think so it was it was just more the size and
ripeness because this particular garden was got the Sun East to West so it had
the most on 10 11 hours at some days you know in the summer yeah so they grew
much larger plants I mean there some of these plants were 13 14 feet tall my
friend my partner is six foot seven there's a photo of him reaching up in
in his wizard outfit that's right his reaches at nine feet and there Wow four
or five feet beyond his reach so yeah they were the Hawaiians h10 and eight
over here where it says h10 yeah if you right let's see right over in this
region h10 of this photo or this drawing where's the beach and and also
in the middle there h10 they they were just massive plants beautiful and it was
good smoke too it was will Hocken again cross with whatever they were calling
Hawaiian which yeah has a Thai background just because Hawaii probably
in the 40s and 50s people from the Far East that visited there that it'd be
very easy to see those sorts of varieties showing up in another tropical
area sure and that's great this is crazy magic because I used to um you know I
drew a plot like this for you know a map like this for just about every outdoor
plot I ever did and it's crazy to see you know that two people on you know
other sides of the country at the same time or doing the same stuff but you
know beyond the fact that I did it yours is the level of detail and artistry is
this way beyond anything I ever did man just this is really cool to see it
really is yeah one thing I might want to ask just because I remember something
you mentioned last time which was basically like you kind of averaged
about 6.8 or 7 ounces a plant or something and then I just heard you say
that like you had these 9 to 13 foot tall plants these Giants so maybe you
could talk a little bit about some of the different stuff that you grew was a
9 or 3 was a 9 foot or 10 foot tall plant only giving you that amount of
flower because of how loose it was did you have some that were a lot denser and
were smaller plants but yielded more because I have old-timers that would
tell me that back in the day you know they would get ounces that were like the
size of my forearm just because the the weed wasn't as dense and so I'm curious
as to like was the 6.8 ounces the stuff that happened in subsequent years when
you were doing like the skunk one did you get a massive variance of weights
and sizes these first couple years when you were experiencing them just curious
the 6.8 ounces average across the entire two gardens that we did later were all
almost all skunk number one and the tallest plants were six seven eight feet
and the Hawaiian in this particular drawing that were so tall they were
multi-pound plants we didn't have a scale at the time down in there and
we brought a dialogram down Oh house good old dialogram it would go up to two
pounds I think I forget but this plant in particular it it was obviously pounds
of weed yeah they were tight buds they aren't rock buds you know like some
especially the ones I know of friends who grow heavily indica backgrounds yeah
yeah those buds just get rock hard densities yeah right these a pound of
this herb probably was twice the size of the of the later skunk number one the
skunk number one were denser definitely yeah I have a quick question that that
that I've just been as going through the pictures and stuff which wizard were you
which which color we all pointed out did you this this was not this was not
me this is my friend Doug yeah the the light blue one was my UK partner that
you have in a photo where he's pointing off in well actually you used it in this
advertisement yes pointing out into the distance the garden is actually right
below him but we had him pointing in a direction that wouldn't be as easy to
figure out if you got to that Canyon yeah and I I was never I never wore the
light blue one because I think it was a smaller robe so we had a oh what is the
one I'm wearing there's one of me and in my tall partner walking across the road
there is the white one hey you're right I'm the one in front and you can just
see my beard back then showing a little bit my my ex-wife my kids mom she's the
one who sewed these up for us she made all of these and that red bag there was
particularly colorful so she was up with the idea too and it was great I don't
know whatever happened to these costumes yeah I was gonna ask that was my I
didn't keep at least one around but I think 45 years later you know it's what
really pulled me to your story when I first like I first like I said heard
about or even found out what mad jag was going through Sam's old posts and going
through the kilo art and I kept seeing this really pretty kilo art and said mad
jag on it and that's what started that journey and then when I saw these
pictures of the robes is when I was like these are my people these are my people
I got to find out who they are you know yeah that log right there that we're
walking across there was a storm I was camped on on the side that this photo is
taken from by our third friend and water was almost touching the bottom of this
this log and I had to sit on it and scoot across with a bag of weed in front
of me and scoot across it ran for like three days from this massive fall storm
like in October and it's a good thing that thing was there else I would have
been stuck on the other side and as it was I was in a silly old army tent and
in water was it had didn't have a built-in bottom and the water was
flowing through it out in the pouring rain and cut a trench around it like you
do in Boy Scouts to funnel the water away and it's funny it was a wilderness
experience okay you know MJ you remember last week we were talking about how the
how growing these plants kind of turns you into an instant young entrepreneur
and the inspiration you know I've often wondered you know what kind of what what
were your intentions you know when you guys came up with this whole mad jag
branding idea and started sending stuff into high times you know what was what
was going through your head when you were when you were starting that thing
it looks it looks like you know early viral marketing stuff is what it looks
like that's fun yeah viral didn't even exist that term right that's right um we
were inspired by high times magazine by the growers guide and then later Robert
Clark's book it just seemed like let's make our own legend you know and maybe
someday we'll be doing a movie about it or it was it was kind of with that
in mind it wasn't that it would make us richer and we would get paid more for
the herb it was just it would set us apart so that's why we went and had
labels made the crack and peel labels I'll be glad to send you guys some
because I've kept a lot of them over the years oh wow yeah they they still work
we would I would go through like an airport I remember I was going up the
escalator and I had one cracked and open I just slapped it on the side of a
paper magazine dispenser in Los Angeles and one of my friends the guy in in
Tempe his brother who was a bigger dealer even than he said did you put one
of your stickers in the airport in LA and I said yeah I did that reminds me so
much of like early skateboarding culture you know yeah and that that was
you know some of the earliest kind of viral marketing like you said I will
marketing absolutely it the things that they that they pioneered back then and
skateboarding was skateboarder magazine you know is is absolutely the foundation
of viral internet marketing today you know social media influencers all that
stuff has roots going directly back to that and I see a lot of that in your
magic stuff too Jim yeah yeah I see I see a lot of that like in the Hades
poster the cosmic boogie poster you know that was like why I chased that so hard
was because as a person who sells seeds and has made that my passion breeding
and all that to me that was the first time that I could find a physical
tangible representation of something I could possess that was a perfect example
of the first strain marketing that I could find you know and and the mad jag
label I put it in that same kind of category it's one of those early just
things that is striking imagery that you never forget and it was done so well but
I never forgot it and always chased it it's almost it's almost like a pre-Reagan
era of freedom where everyone thought things were about to loosen up yep and
then they were kind of loose for a bit and then they went in a totally
different direction for 15 more years there's all these old posters that you
can I found him a few times and I never bought one but there's an old poster
where it's like they made him declaring like that ah we finally did it you know
like prohibitions over and posters but they were just a little early you know
yeah yeah like 40 years yeah just a little bit yeah one thing I'm curious
about and like the actual growing part of it is since it sounds like you were
basically this first season you were just collecting seeds from friends and
people you could get access to what were the things that you liked and disliked
about the first crop like did you look at those things when you were trying to
get away with it and you were like oh my god this 13-foot plant is blowing past
all the bushes and everything else that we were trying to contain it and like
make it look like it was normal I don't want to do that giant again because it
it makes me nervous or like what was the what were the thoughts there because
obviously like this is the first time that you were seeing a lot of these
things grown correct yeah definitely so what to expect really like you just oh
this is what Hawken and this is why in and this is this and this is that and it
was kind of like plant spacing and how big they were gonna get what they were
gonna do was all kind of a mystery I would imagine oh yeah we were I had had
the one year before this with my dealer friend from Tempe in a neighboring
canyon and that's the first time I got a chance to see plants actually reach
harvest time and they were all Mexican strains like you said but in the next
over the next year which the next year we tried a garden in that Canyon that
was massive it was so huge we had to get a we had to pump up 200 feet to the
alluvial plateau we had found and it wasn't really smart it's a good thing it
failed but we got us so we got a submersible pump that weighed like 40
pounds and hosed going up and the first time we watered we laid a hose on the
ground and it just went it disappeared into the soil is it this we moved it
another 50 feet it just made a hole and went down in we couldn't flood irrigate
it just it was so loose with boulders and stuff below even though it was this
beautiful smooth garden on top that it it just didn't work it was like dredging
yeah and then the following year we had collected all these other seeds Thai
Colombian and we and I knew from that very first year how to do it and we just
went on the larger scale these the Colombian though that we had no idea
like we discovered that how long it took to finish we just knew it was super
great weed that we had smoked and we kept the seeds and so these on this
garden I'd say 30% of it failed because it was just it wasn't ready is this the
garden that's up here correct I'm showing us in a year you're speaking
about this it no this one is 1980 it's we were looking at the 78 earlier yeah
the key at the bottom which one are you speaking about currently that's one that
I want to um the original one 1978 oh so that's the one that 30% failed yeah
and by failed you mean just didn't finish right they were huge plants that
one photo that he has from last episode they were beautiful plants and slightly
different colors because they were different Colombian seeds but the c10
here c9 wherever the C shows up they were big big plants that make it easier
to see right there if I zoom out and it might be too much but so eventually did
you just end up having to chop them down did you just and and you just realized
they weren't done they weren't they weren't real weed yet and and composted
them down there no we took them out that they're the ones that I had to scoot
across that folder with in a bag once we cut them down to branch size and they
were the size of my little fingertip buds and they were kind of tight and
nice and we sold them actually they they were just a very mild smoke they they
had resin but not not like they would have been super killer weed if they'd
gotten a month and a half more or two like the end of December early January
like they would in the tropics but it was so let me let me maybe ask you this
because I didn't I don't think we talked about this last time in the area that
you were in what month or around what date was it safe to plant and then what
was kind of like the latter part of your harvest window where after that it was
cold and rainy and you were in fear of losing luckily those giant Hawaiian
plants they because they were will Hawken crosses too they were ready in
October and like no later than mid October I'd say probably and the rains
and cold didn't really hit us October traditionally in Arizona's the second
driest month of the year June is the driest October and this is in the 70s it
has changed since then but we had a beautiful fall so down in the canyon to
have cool nights but the days would be warm and nice so it it just we harvested
everything out of this camp out of this garden except those Colombian and we
were going back and watering them and back and watering them and finally on
Thanksgiving when it was snowing up above and we had to go out on the mesas
in inches of snow and big clods of mud on our feet it was just we decided we
have to take them now because we didn't want to come back any colder and wetter
yeah and so you know it just what it just never reached maturity but the
earlier ones all these others the Hawaiians were came out wonderful and we
were able to hang them there in the shade dry them and I don't remember
actually we didn't have breakdown boxes like we did in following years we just
um I think put them in our in big bags you know garbage garbage bags and carry
them up top of the rim with our own pack frames we had metal pack frames Kelty's
and we would just strap everything to them so they didn't get handled as well
that's another thing that when we had breakdown boxes after they were met
after the skunk number one was manicured it was put right into these
wonderful cardboard boxes that we bought stacks of and brought them down and then
we assembled them down in the canyon taped them and you could carry six or
seven stacked on a pack frame any more than that they would be catching on
branches and it wasn't feasible so yeah that came out very nice they they didn't
get crushed didn't get smashed pound at a time it roughly in each box was that
just that that 1979 harvest was that the one that ended up in the High Times is
that what was referred to in that High Times that is up here on the page and
you'll see here it says
Colombian stock killer purple mm we it was it was funny because one guy
actually paid us two thousand a pound for it you know and then we had some
lightly seeded Hawaiian one branch out of all this garden we came back after as
we traditionally did every week we were looking through inspecting and then we
found one branch that was seeded it had you know her me back yeah yeah
the garbage bag and put it over quickly cut that branch off but it had enough
time to lightly seed a few of the plants neighboring to it but people love
finding those few seeds and they were like do you have any more of this yeah
they like the smoke and it was the Wahakan Hawaiian kind of Wow and so how
many of these in this list are from you guys on this yes just the one that says
magic Hawaiian magic since Amina got them all these others were current
things on the market yeah I mean like downtown
that's something we didn't actually chat about last time but it's pretty
interesting when you guys were doing your gorilla you know obviously like you
can get a wildly divergent amount of males and females off a batch of seeds
did you plant everything in your alluvial planes and all that and then
just cut males as they appeared did you plant them in pot you did yep and did
you go out there more than once a week when things were turning from veg to
flower so that you didn't show up and all of a sudden the stray male it like
nuked a whole patch with seed or how did you handle the transition when you were
worried about maybe we haven't caught all the males yet right well the next
garden that was 19 marked as 1979 as the double e the reason we called it the
double e is it was on a topo map right under the word Creek where the double
E's were and so we went oh that's an easy way to spot it so you called it
doubly we spent three nights I mean three days and two nights every week on
the next three years we didn't just go out overnight and water and then leave
the next day so we were there three days out of seven and we anything that was
even remotely spooky looking like wow this might be a male change in here we
then I don't know we might have just prematurely cut him out but everything
was grown from seed and the the year we ran two gardens of our big big here the
one garden good thing I bought 3,000 seeds because the plants were about a
foot tall and we came back a week three days later four days later and
grasshoppers had eaten them down every single one unbelievable we had to
replant on the 1st of June oh yeah we put them in a tiny seed garden area
where we could put a screening over it and they were super crowded and we were
just digging them out with wet with inner palm in our hands and plugging them
in plugging men plugging them in and replacing everything that had been eaten
by and what was weird there was a few plants that made it through from the
grasshopper plague and while the ones that we planted and they were like a
month month earlier than the ones we had to replant in June maybe more than a
month and the June ones caught up with them it was amazing because of the
hundred-degree weather and the Sun and the watering by the time end of the
summer like let's say August was around they were all equal yeah that was good
but having that little six foot by ten foot garden full of seeds luckily week
we were able to replant otherwise it would have been catastrophic oh I bet I
mean maybe maybe another angle is where did you first learn about what an early
female or an early male even looked like back then was it Rob Clark's book was it
high times was it people telling you you know because obviously like now you
know like you look at it and like two pistols mean a female and a little claw
looking thing means a male but back then did you have that kind of knowledge
beforehand did they get kind of advanced before you realized what they were well
I I'm not exactly sure I know from the first year in 1976 that we grew I got to
see what males look like and females but not till they were probably more
advanced and visible I think Rob Clark I mean his early book the one that he did
in 77 on pod press that was actually his dissertation yeah yeah that he he hand
drew all the drawings in there oh wow yeah it's cover every single plant he
hand drew those so he's not only yeah he's a he's a good artist plus his
photography later man he says when he would travel around and did that book on
hashish the photos are just excellent you know no watering and the growers
guide by Mel Frank that I think showed I don't know if they were photos but it it
was a learning curve but by this year that I had already grown for two years
before this so not the original garden but by 1980 so when we went for two
gardens at once we had enough experience to know what to look for plus we were
spending three days a week in the garden and I think maybe even at the time when
the males had to be separated we might have just had one of her we had a third
partner who helped us part-time and he was from Switzerland he's still a good
friend of mine I saw him when I went to Spanavis in 2019 and stayed at his house
that's nice and he's he's five years older than I am he's he still smokes
hash mixed with tobacco you know 50 years as the custom over there yeah yeah
and he's an artist of course Swiss artist and he may have just been down
there and as because I know what you're saying we ended up it was almost 5050
with the skunk 5050 males 5050 females it was wrong we didn't end up with big
huge empty sections of the garden and we also transplanted into any open sections
if we had to we would dig up a plant that was four feet tall with a big room
Oh Wow and slide it over five more feet to get it into a hole that had more Sun
and and was empty because a male had been removed yeah we did a lot of
transplanting and movements it was experimental to see if it would work in
it yeah they're very hardy plants yeah there is resilient the term weed is is
accurate I mean Wow yeah you know you know Jackie we last week we talked about
the turps and flavors of Colombian and and you know you were just talking about
that first year where the Colombians didn't finish but you got a few purple
ones out of there that were you know that were made good smoke but you know I
wasn't really satisfied with my answer last week when when I was asked what
what did I you know describe those those flavors and smells coming off a
Colombian and you know I realized as I thought back on it that you know that
most of my experience and what I know about Colombian is more about what came
imported you know and was bought than what I grew because it just it was just
so difficult to pull those things off and so you know for me it's it's such a
treat that we have you know we have it's the the essence of it captured in in the
O'Hays as Sam shared it you know that that because otherwise it's so hard to
grow you know growers all over the country were like they tried and it
didn't turn out well and then they found something better and the stuff just kind
of disappeared so but you know can you talk about that that Colombian the
smells I mean that did the anthocyanin or whatever the the purple yeah did that
really take over and dominate the one that you managed to harvest and or you
know no they were they yeah because it was like you know it was Thanksgiving
and as you know when the light starts dropping down the purple tends to happen
more and it it didn't really have a characteristic the Hawaiians that were
Wahakan crosses they had a wonderful scent growing but the Colombian because
they didn't even have the tiny buds till like late October beginning of November
they they didn't it wasn't warm like the hot summer end of the summer they
didn't have really much scent at all until they were dried and then you
crushed them yep but the I know what you're talking about the piney that's
how you would you know focus on the piney last week and that's you know I
had a lot of that too then and you know like I said all my school all my
friends at school everybody was growing these Colombian plants and the Christmas
trees everybody had these little Christmas trees out there but some
people they got more mature and you know you got you got a really nice buds but
the pine was was dominant for sure but you know that the diversity of what we
got in the imported smoke was just above and beyond you know because the golds
and the reds and yeah yeah just some amazing stuff you know and old and
distinctive you know each one just such a unique distinctive thing just like
Mexico all of them you know whether it's in a low or Guerrero or Oaxaca yeah
entirely the way they looked they smelled and the highs too yeah
Mexico's a long country Colombia is pretty big but there's in Columbia it
was like tropical versus yeah five thousand foot level versus Santa Marta
way up at eight thousand nine thousand feet so it they were land races that
didn't really get mixed up too much back in the old days at least until the 60s
maybe yeah and the impact of the processing and transport to you know
whatever it was in Colombia before it went on the boat or in the in the case
of the high-grade stuff like the golds and the reds you know maybe on an
airplane you know that that had such an impact on it too but so I think a lot
about the commercial stuff that that you know we used to buy on the street or
sell even and you know what what I think is interesting is that the essence of
that you know that it was a shadow of what it was when they when they finished
yeah yeah but the essence of it point one thing that we could throw in there
is that a number of people that have talked to Matt and I about growing in
that era when they first grew green marijuana they got scared because they
didn't think people would want it because all the stuff they got was brown
or yellow or that's why that's why I asked last week if they if a sun-dried
because that tends to be the way that the Mexicans and stuff we're getting
their goal it's like girdling or sun drying but we've heard that consistently
that a lot of times the first home grows of the first outdoors that people did in
different regions they're like oh my god it's such a weird color it's green are
people gonna like it they've never seen it before and like obviously like now
it's shifted but I'm curious is when you did your when you did your your shade
drying and stuff like that what kind of colors were you getting was it staying
green was it turning golds and yellows and browns no gold yellows or browns
just greens or dark greens that the skunk number one was super dark green I
understand yeah interesting day but even in 76 when we my dealer friend and I
grew that first year the proof was in the pudding we would give people a smoke
just one puff or two and they were overwhelmed if they were used to
commercial stuff and seedless they had not seen seedless really unless they had
gotten tie sticks tie sticks were pretty much always seedless and the tie sticks
back then were not green they were brown or you know in there all right
all of yeah maybe but the light green you're right I didn't even give that a
thought because once our few people that bought from us smoked it that that's all
they cared man they bought everything two people bought everything we grew
basically that's okay because we heard we heard people telling us stories about
how when they first grew green weed they tried to brown it up they were like oh
man no one's gonna want this it's not the right color right doesn't look like
anything we've ever had we need to do something it's it's this is wrong well
and not only that but some of the earliest you know when people have a bad
experience with green weed so you know the guy who grows a you know a patch
full of Colombian and it doesn't finish and he harvests this leafy stuff with
just a few white hairs and mostly tops and and you know he handles it poorly
it's loaded with chlorophyll and he tries he sells it to people and and you
know all of a sudden there's this bad reputation green weed is bad right and
then the next year people grow different seeds this shit gets mature they handle
it better you know and all of a sudden there's there's high quality green weed
but people's perception of the color is that it's a turnoff so you got to try
and overcome that getting them to you know try it listen this is different or
whatever or or the thing about renaming or changing the appearance I mean a lot
of people would you know we knew that the stuff molded but you know that the
Colombian that turned it brown it was some sort of mold from being pressed
when it was still wet or carried in the in the cargo bay of the ship or whatever
and so since we've been smoking that stuff for years and then you know people
thought that was okay and they might try and you know they might try and press
some other wet homegrown and get a different appearance but it never turned
out like the Colombians you know and it only wound up making it worse but that
chlorophyll was pretty horrible to smoke if you had those unfinished tops that
somebody was trying to pass off as smoke and you know and plus high times was you
know was was becoming really popular and people were hearing about green from
Hawaii in California at least by the time I was in it so that the thing for
us was you know I mean I would I had produced some amazing freaking indica
buds but I would say it was Hawaiian you know or from California just because you
know you're homegrown isn't you know because I was charging 200 an ounce for
this stuff and and people were happy to pay it even though you know as kids they
didn't have a lot of money they would find a way I had a guy I had a guy trade
me a PA system with you know with a beautiful mic and a fender backstage 20
for for a half ounce of tie purple time and he loved it he loved it so much he
came back for more and unfortunately I was out of that and all I had was the
green Fino which didn't finish at all and I was like okay well you know I knew it
wasn't the same stuff but I wanted the money so I sold him that second bag and
and he was so pissed off I wound up giving his money back because it wasn't
even close to the same thing as the purple one man so with with the skunk
one did you notice any like solely broadleaf expressions stuff that looked
skinny in the skunk one top well one of the photos that you posted last week I
think what was interesting about the skunk was it it grew like long colas and
they were almost self pruning in the fall the the Sun leaves would all turn
yellow and you could just shake the plant they would fall off and leave
these long green colors and I have one photo on from that I took that is just
slightly blurry but it's just a series of these four four to six foot tall
colors you know like one Cola coming out of the ground and those are the ones that
were six point eight ounces you know on average it was dense and nice very deep
deep green but there was no indica fat leaf expressions solely it was uniform
it was truly true breeding at that time what Robert and Sam had accomplished I
think Robert was more the geneticist in doing it but there's some some place in
the history where they said they had 10,000 things going in red cups and they
chose from that and I don't know if that's accurate but I'm not sure yeah it
it really um when we planted it it grew the way it looked each plant they had a
little bit wider leaves certainly than like a capoca gold or Santa Marta
tropical thin leaf but nothing like the deep chunk or maple leaf indica is that
you know people add on on I see mag that look just like you know umbrellas
almost you can yeah your head if it's raining dinosaur leaves yeah exactly was
it your impression then I mean obviously you said before that you reached out to
you reached out to to Rob through a letter and contacted him and he brought
you the seeds is what you said previously when did you meet Sam back
then did he talk about their partnership did he did they did he tell you any of
the work that he had done to get to skunk one did he all my info came from
Robert I never met Sam I've never talked to him personally I've I've private
messaged with him on IC mag in 2012 but nothing I've I've sent him some labels
for his collection but I don't I've never met him it was all secondhand from
Robert when he described and I was when I got on when I got on there Sam was
very big that's where I saw all of his collection of you know essentially
breeder art and grower art that they wouldn't that they would make and
attach to their pounds he would post a lot in something called I was was it
called the breeders lab maybe sound like that yeah something along those lines
but he was pretty active in that and so I was just I'm just always curious as
to about like what you know had brought did Rob tell you how long he'd been
working on skunk one when he gave it to you or any kind of like any info along
those lines yeah that you know he worked in Ben Loman which is a little
town up in the Redwoods just above Santa Cruz you you might go through Ben Loman
for instance if you're gonna go up further up to like La Honda where Neil
Young lived it still a distance from San Francisco and he told me that that's
where he they had their little underground greenhouse going in and but
he made it sound like it they had been doing it for a year or two before he
never went into the history of these other neighbors and Santa Cruz that Sam
knew that were the two brothers and yeah all those stories those I read more
about later in on IC mag and people disputing it and one person saying oh no
it was this and that so yeah he he he mentioned though that he had been
working on it I bought his 1977 treatise not from him I don't know where
I found it but somewhere online and then when he came out with marijuana botany
you know everyone bought it but if it wasn't for the growers guide Mel Franks
we would have failed because when we had that year the second year where we got
this twist on the end of all of our plants and they were already six foot
seven foot plants we were like freaking out because they were supposed to be
getting flowers and instead they had the leaves twisting and we he talked about
micronutrients and how you could have a you could be short and a couple
micronutrients in your soil and that could make the world of difference so we
got some concentrated seaweed extract yeah we have 90 different sure yeah
minerals from the ocean nothing even comes close and we bought a big backpack
pump sprayer filled with water I think it held two gallons and just walked
around and sprayed the plants and I think we did it once and waited a three
or four days and then we did it again and but by the end of a week or eight or
nine days they were all untwisting so whatever what they were missing and it
was because of Mel Franks book about Mike talking about micronutrient
problems we kind of zoned it down to being malignant lack of a little you
know what's what's amazing about that to me is that many years later in 1993 when
I was planning on growing for the first time two of the three books that taught
me things was Rob Clark's marijuana botany and Mel Franks growers guide yeah
you know there are different editions by then obviously they've been through some
revisions and things as time had gone on but the same knowledge to a young kid
desperate for it so that's pretty cool that that growers guide there was nothing
that even came close when it first came out I mean yeah it really was really was
fantastic mine got so dog-eared I put some like rings through it to hold it
together and I passed it on to you know another another guy that you know wound
up growing and breeding and taking seeds to dead concerts and stuff which was
pretty pretty foreign to me as a skateboard punk rocker yeah interesting
Mel it was I think I can't remember there was three people involved in that
book Mel Frank and Ed Rosenwald to I remember off the top of my head but there
was a third author that was that contributed to it to some degree I still
have the books at my house was Ang Lee no he's another photographer yeah that's
it right there yeah yeah that book that book I probably read a hundred times in
six or eight months before I set up my first indoor because I had no idea what
I was doing it's he when you got it not so it was probably called the indoor
outdoor marijuana growers guide but the original one was just growers guide
growers guide yeah indeed I index my books so that I could go in there and
find whatever page I needed to really quickly and then on the marijuana
spurs guide yeah more stuff you know if I already like my mom I think it's
probably hard for young people today to like conceive of just how sparse and
hard to come by some of this information was because they're used to the internet
and typing things in and forums and resources but it was really limited back
then in terms of what you could access and you know and how to learn and so
those books played them obviously even with you guys they played a massive role
in in teaching people exactly how to pull off a successful crop this is the
first first year came out 1978 it's the first edition and or press in Berkeley
and mine is kind of falling apart so I understand what you're talking about oh
look what's one of my book markers in here I didn't even remember oh yeah look
at that that's another one so I have at least two of them and we used to go to
the library and I mean I would search for everything on hydroponics because I
even growing outdoors I was doing outdoor hydroponics and in 1981 you know
five gallon buckets filled with peat moss cow shit perlite and vermiculite
and then you know fed with eco grow you know granular two-part mix and yeah so I
went to the library and I started started researching hydroponics and
basically I stole any good book from the library that hydroponics and kept it you
know it was very much so study this is the book but we are referring to the the
Rob Clark thesis it's called the botany and ecology of cannabis this is my copy
that I scanned in is it loaded on the screen they're numbered mine not mine's
actually not no it's one of the few that's not Clark actually the one of the
few times that he's ever responded about anything was to give me the print run on
it and apparently there were I think 1,500 total rooms a first print of 500
and a second print of a thousand but you can't tell the difference between the
two some are numbered some are not but another example this is he drew this by
hand and all through the book this book are his drawings yeah ordinary I can
just imagine getting wasted and just sitting in just digging drawing I could
not draw that by hand no no they're they're beautiful drawings in here like
and that's one of the things like I've been sitting on it forever and you know
it's not really out there for people to see but there are some of the most
beautiful drawings of cannabis and the in the cannabis part the parts of the
cannabis plant I love taxi and they're seen yeah it's crazy he did such an
amazing job back then to me it it kind of it kind of you know it kind of
reminds me of early early botanists and explorers geneticists they travel around
you know different islands and stuff and discovering dodo birds and things like
that and sitting around drawing in their sketchbooks describing the fauna and
flora of these these exotic locations it's just gorgeous and he got it so
accurately I mean just they looked exactly right the the indica plants that
he he drew in marijuana botany were just spot-on you know yeah and the elegant the
elegance of the branches and the leaves that he drew I just I always I didn't
know if he drew him or somebody else did but I did I asked him yeah you drew I
just thought they were gorgeous yeah there's another book he did called
hands that was released in Germany that has some beautiful illustrations of his
and but it's not available in the United States but if you guys can trade trace
down a copy of hands which is German for him there's more beautiful drawings from
him in there cool if you zoom over to the humbled up
here on your list the article that I found on humble growing I thought not
the dog would find this interesting it has a it has Rob Clark in the corner
here when he's 29 years old oh wow sure does holding a bud and it's in color but
I only scan in black and white because I might I'm running low on the other well
actually I could have scanned it that's true okay this works I'm thinking about
but I I met him I think this article is from about 1982 because they mentioned
something the price of marijuana in 82 so yeah right up here yeah in 82 an
estimated 1.8 billion dollars a street value yeah so he was 29 in 82 if so you
can go backwards and figure that out how old he is and and I met Rob he came
down to the grill once with his wife at the time and I was we hung out together
for a few days in the grill and the concept was he was gonna look for some
you know land races there Jamaican I yeah I didn't see him after those first
few days but I think he traveled around a bit but this is great because it talks
about the helicopters and in Humboldt and yeah I'm so glad you say this second
photo I figure where it is oh well one of the one of the interesting things
about when helicopters first started flying is that people were growing all
these giant sativas and the hills and Humboldt and Mendocino and nobody as
long as you were tucked away nobody cared how big they were because no one
was looking for them and so there's articles I've read where like the very
first gardens that got busted by helicopters they actually chopped down
most of the gardens with chainsaws yeah because the the stalks were like this
but they were so big and thick and the people weren't worried about about
getting caught so they just had these ginormous you know these huge sativa
plants oh goodness look at that yeah right gangster oh yeah that's pushing a
certain narrative not at all that was common down and where I was living to
you know the National Guard helicopters were flying looking looking for the crop
and you know when we would go out when I went out to my gardens I was always
dressed in camouflage you know the whole guerrilla mindset leaving no trail you
would create a trail to your spot where you would go from step to step always
putting your foot in exactly the same spot that you did the time before you
know crawling under bushes and stuff it was um yeah you're probably familiar
Raho we have we have a bunch of manzanitas yeah in Mendocino County
which are for people that aren't familiar they're kind of these like
smooth limbed bushes that get anywhere from 6 to 12 feet tall and you can kind
of thin them out underneath and a lot of people grew in manzanita patches because
you could still get some filtered light but it wasn't going to be totally
exposed so crawling around in manzanita patches and cutting off lower branches
to make spots for gardens is is like my first outdoor experiences what is that
holding up there right there sir can you zoom in on this this is these are humble
photos from that same article here a little bit no he's holding up something
on his thing Matt okay let me see over here oh no you might know it's not easy
to get back to you hold on there we go there we go
damn it Matt oh there's that here's some guys pruning their a father and son
pruning some big leaf plants too yeah and they both have 38 caliber weapons in
their back pocket that they point out in this article that's on the guard dog and
then here's an aerial shot of a huge garden like the chance you're just
grabbing people took that risk but it didn't always work once the helicopters
came the helicopters dramatically changed people's approaches I'd be up to
a huge degree because most of these things were grown in like like you know
I mean that's super easily visible from the air but like not it's not from
driving around that's him yeah the color difference is just so obvious from
the air you know it did the tactics for hiding this stuff became you know pretty
look at this bastard creative these are your humble sheriffs yeah in the garden
that they just dismantled you know that Newsweek magazine mad jag the that came
out that at the same time there was another article I can't remember if it
was time or it was a national publication where they came out with an
article talking about this new high potency kind of super weed that was that
was you know flooding the streets called skunk yeah I've been I've been looking
for this magazine or this article ever since and I honestly I thought the
reference was in that Newsweek that had the guy with the mask and the in the m16
but um it's it wasn't you know I've read that article since and I don't think
there's a reference to it but they described the effects of skunk in that
article it's it's classic reefer madness you know writing yeah you know but they
honestly they got it right and they they described the appearance of it they
described the effects and it was pretty spot-on for what I thought skunk was
tears a reason for tears look at that this is from the state of Utah and it's
a higher reason madness basically about you know what's really bizarre is this
high school undercover it's an article about guys who look at he's got a heavy
metal t-shirt but he's shown his badge and it's a whole article about going
undercover in the various high schools in Utah like 21 Jump Street like the TV
show I mean I'll tell you this is obviously so much later but the first
time that I ever saw a guy with waist-long dreadlocks tackle someone and
then put cuffs on them oh wow and on dead tour I was like oh man you know
are these guys labeled in this picture? They do look labeled don't they? I can't read what they are but they do look labeled yeah
yeah the top ones they're labeled like Hawaiian Maui stickless tie orange
Colombian they spell Colombian wrong too. They always spell it wrong back there.
So they had some really good photos here of different things that they had confiscated.
Oaxacan red, Colombian red, Guerrero gold. Wow I always love those pictures the
reference pictures from point of origin and time are so valuable so so so
valuable but it's hard when it's cops you know taking the pictures and you got
to hope that they got your bag right and got this kept the strange name with it
I think if it's your bag you probably got other things to worry about than
the freakin provenance you know. I mean one thing that one thing that I think is
kind of interesting too and it's it's it's obviously we don't need to dwell on
it too much but I do think that like from what I'm listening to and you guys
are talking about all these different Highland and lowland Colombians and all
these different regions and stuff like that and all these different Mexicans
and what they were I kind of think that like the cocaine trade and profitability
with that sort of blocked off the next generation of Americans from being able
to experience that because the groups that were all bringing in those
Colombians and bringing in those Mexicans they shifted to a more
profitable thing and then it also became unsafe for people a lot of times that
looked like us to go down to those regions and get those things. So there
was an era. It was two things that were happening at the same time yes the
cocaine you know became much more profitable for the same people that use
you know were formerly smuggling cannabis but at the same time the
American you know homegrown market had had happened and and that product was
just such a higher level of quality than what what the imports had because of the
freshness and you know the introduction of hard-hitting hard-hitting indica's in
their high. Tell me what what year do you think that was? 82 83. Oh wow. Yeah.
Because I mean we don't need to sidetrack on it but there's been an
interplay between like what Mexico and down south does versus what's going on
in America and like each one responding to the other in terms of cannabis that's
been going on for I guess. That's not a that's not a sidetrack at all as a
matter of fact it's another Mad Jags story. Yeah. I would love to I mean that
the story about you know how you know Mad Jags contribution to the to the the
the Mexican cannabis gene pool. My people's you represent my people in
Mexico. All right. So how did that how did this start happening? What era did
the the Mexico stuff start occurring? Mad Jag and how? Well the last year I grew in
Mad Jag Canyon was 81 so by 82 I I knew a guy who was a pilot and it's not the
pilot I wrote about like that you know when we talked about 60 tons of pack
he had. Yeah. This is a guy I met him when I was working a regular job at a
truck loading place. I worked for Georgia Pacific for two years in Phoenix in the
late 70s and this guy one day he walked up to me I was loading his truck up with
empty plastic bottles which is what they produce at Georgia Pacific and he said
hey if if I found a whole bunch of weed out in the desert could you sell it? I said what?
I had short hair too but he just figured. He felt that vibe? And and I said what do
you mean? He says well I was flying over this area and I see where someone
jettisoned one of an empty fuel canister and it's stuck in the ground and I'm
gonna go out there and check it and it I think it's they were smuggling weed
and I went sure man just let me know. He came back a week later and he was all
disappointed because it was just an empty fuel canister. Oh damn. And it was
actually Air Force that had dropped it and it was stuck in the ground looked
like a bomb you know. Yeah. It didn't explode but then he started talking
about other things and then all of a sudden like two months later he comes
back and I'm loading his truck and he says I I met the people in Mexico and
and I said what? And so he's he stole a twin-engine Cessna from Scottsdale
Airport flew it to Guadalajara and gave it to the cartel to prove to them that
he was not a nerd. That is so gangster. I love it. I know. Later he stole a helicopter out of
Apache Junction and flew it down but he only got 20 miles into Mexico before
something went wrong mechanically and he had to crash land and hike his way back
and the FBI came to his house because he found his fingerprints in Mexico on this
and he denied everything so they couldn't do anything scared the shit out
of him but I bet. Good lord. They brought several loads up of weed. I found an
airstrip in along the Mogollon Rim in a small town area way out by itself and
they were like within five minutes they said they would be there at one o'clock
they were like they're at 105 kicking out bales onto the airship and they were
they would bring 500 kilos each flight and that's where one of two of the
flights had labels already in them from someone who was supposed to get them in
California but something went wrong and we got them instead. I'm still hunting
for those labels I've got them somewhere but anyway. So you had a connection with
those guys? Yeah it was 82 and 83. El Bufalo that Rafael Caro Quintero you
could see it from space it was a square couple miles you know they show it in
that TV show Narco Mexico. Yeah so that's that's the name of the garden or
the farm El Bufalo? Rancho Bufalo. And was this at the beginning of the Gallardo era of the development?
Yeah this was when they were just doing weed. Yeah. What happened was they
grew thousands and thousands of hectares of weed but they didn't have
anyone growing seeds seed crops so they they were desperate for seeds and so my
pilot friend along with my other friend who was the weed dealer in Tempe we
filled two quart-sized bags half full and he stuck one in each of his cowboy
boots and flew to Guadalajara and gave it to them and they were so grateful because it they they had no seeds.
Yeah. So unfortunately I was part of this because seeds from five different zones
in Mexico ended up in their hands and became the new hybrid and oh well.
Why would you say unfortunately? In 1980s Dutch genetics were already in the grill of
Jamaica and the people go wild over them they were growing them up in Orange Hill and all this so
land races were getting squeezed out and to find true Jamaican I don't think it's
there anymore. Yeah. There's probably some land races still in stashed spots and
certainly in Colombia but boy Jamaica being a little island. So maybe you could
clarify for a second then those seeds that you brought down or he brought down
smuggled in his boots what were they a mix of? They were a mix of Guerrero, Sinaloa, Michoacan, Oaxacan
that my dealer friend in Tempe had high-graded over the course of like two
or three years. He had bags. The best of the loads that had passed through.
And so that's why you were like oh you were a little bummed about it because
you kind of mixed the strains and then they started growing in and then instead
of it being like a regional thing where these specific kinds were coming from it
was sort of a blend coming back. Right and we have no idea. El Bufalo got
discovered I wrote down this November 14th of 84 is when they found it and
burned it and it actually the smoke affected people within a hundred mile
radius. They burned 500 hectares and they estimate that it was worth 2.5 billion
dollars at that time in 84. So there's a famous scene in Narcos where he I
think it was it was Gallardo's brother Raph. Is that his brother? It produces in the
series like this is the super the super strain that the Sinsamea. Right. Was this
before or after you met him that or is this the the hybrid that you're talking
about? Well we gave them seeds in 82 and 83 and El Bufalo was captured and burned.
I don't know if it ran for years before that but just in general they King
Taro was growing weed in other places but Buffalo was like their huge place
they had their own wells drilled there it was in Sinaloa and I've I've read
about it in a book called the underground I forget I've got the book
it's like 900 pages long and it's written by a DEA agent who is in charge
of all the stuff going on then and it has three chapters one on heroin one on
cocaine and one on weed and the one on weeds about El Bufalo being spotted by a
TWA pilot or something they're flying over and they went what in the world and
they just mentioned it casually that's where Kiki Camarena got a job and
actually penetrated it and in the second movie of Sicario mm-hmm so
popular it's kind of similar because he's dressed up as a compass you know
and he gets a job. Kiki is the is that the that's the name of the DEA agent
that got killed? Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Camarena and that caused a huge amount
of problems. Oh yeah that was it? They just left it alone you know but they didn't and
that's when they were switching over to cocaine just about 84 85 I think that
being burned. King Taro from what I read just became an addict of you know drug
addict of whatever. He was sad he didn't want to see them go into cocaine
but Rafael Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo he went ahead and went you know he
became he formed the first cartel with all these loose clauses that were
existing guys over here guys over there and I stayed at his hotel in 84 one of
his many he owned apparently a lot and my friend who is the pilot we went down
there and my friend from Colombia found his way there from Colombia and we all
had a big party and they were hoping that my friend from Colombia would be
able to turn them on to newer connections and stuff I don't know
really what happened because he loved to do coke but he and I both decided we
didn't want to be in that business yeah and the pilot this guy he he kept going
they were using our airstrip the one that we had found for weed 1600 to 2000
pounds of coke at a time they did nine loads and then they an off-duty sheriff
who was cutting wood saw them landing and unloading and they got busted and I have no idea what
happened it was in the newspaper I've got a clip I've I've posted before I
think on IC mag but I never met I never met Miguel Felix but my partners did I
did enjoy his hospitality because we went in this hotel room there was a just
like in the movies a plate with a four ounce pile of cocaine on it and two
other guys who did nothing but just bring cases of beer all through the day
that's nice of them yeah sounds like a weekend at not so's place I guess yeah
it is it is except except there's a lot more men a lot Matt loves that if he
doesn't at least once a show me off my game with something like that he's upset
so yeah I'm about this opening and he took it she said but I mean just you
know that that whole thing is just crazy but when I when I was when I was
starting to do guerrilla in California one of the things that the Mexicans did
was that even with the cocaine I was told that like still 70% of their
profits was marijuana and so they really didn't like all this homegrown in the
West Coast sort of taking their taking their you know their their sales really
well and so they started sending these teams all from down by where Matt is all
the way up to the Oregon border and going in the National Forest and just
growing a huge amount as much as they could get away with in all the National
Forests so that way they didn't have to smuggle it over the border yeah you know
and that's that was kind of so there's been this obviously this like that's
what I was saying before about like how one one country influences the other is
the homegrown movement has dramatically changed how the how the Mexicans
approach growing weed because you know for a long time they were sort of the
primary weed people yeah yeah yeah for sure especially in Arizona with the
border here Tucson was like the capital of smugglers and and dealers and then it
moved up to Phoenix and Tempe and Scottsdale but they they busted a big
row in the canyon next to us just 10-15 years ago and it was a gang from from
Mexico operating out of Phoenix and they had a spring that they had found up on
the side of this mountain and they had a system of drip irrigation that ran a
mile down the canyon. They just went too big these guys they just didn't even
think about hunters and ranchers and they just threw a team at it grew all
this stuff and then they all got busted.
I mean to some degree.
Spring on a hillside model that's that's the way it was done in NorCal
when I was out there that summer I'm sure you've seen lots of that.
I mean the I think the cartels kind of had a they viewed there a lot of their workers as
semi-disposable and so they sort of expected a certain amount to get in
trouble and they just threw a lot of people out there in a lot of different
regions and they figured most of them will be successful and some of them
won't. Yeah. And that's kind of how they went about it I think.
Just a numbers game.
Yeah I mean they had money.
But you know when the powder came in you know I think a lot of that Colombian
import just disappeared.
Stopped entirely.
Yeah and the Mexican commercial became they probably filled the gap for that
for that tier of product quality around the country.
I can tell you that you know I mean I started smoking in the 90s.
There was brown Mexican and green Mexican. I didn't see Thai. I didn't see
Colombian. I didn't see Panamanian. I didn't see any of those of those famous
things that people wax poetic about. It was Mexican.
Yeah I saw and I'm a decade later and all I saw was Mexican too.
You know it's just I never saw Thai. Never saw anything other than just Mexican.
Yep. Yeah it was gone.
Okay so we got a little bit into Mexico. Just a hair. Do you want to go more into
that? Is there some more details you want to add in there?
Not really. It's just rubbing shoulders with these famous people was kind of weird.
I didn't know who they were at the time. They were just guys exporting weed from Guadalajara area.
But then when we found out it was Miguel Angel and we were like whoa shit man.
Yeah I bet.
We I'm so glad we didn't get sucked into the cocaine deal because the this guy who
was a truck driver. He could fly helicopters. He could fly planes. He went that direction and
he sold 10 kilos to an undercover agent north of Phoenix in the biggest hand-to-hand sale buy
in Arizona history at the time. And he got I think it was seven kilos and he got 10 years in prison.
His brother kept going and did those loads on our air our the airstrip that we found.
And they got nine of them before they got busted. And we calculated at the price of
coke at the time that it was it came to around a quarter billion dollars.
Whoa.
250 million dollars of coke that they successfully brought in before they got busted. And I have no
idea what happened to those boys. Boy.
Geez.
Yeah.
Griselda Blanco. I had never heard her name until I read about it in Newsweek or Time.
But that's who my Colombian friend was actually working for. And his job was to count money.
And he would go to Aspen where they bring in DC-9s or something like six tons at a time of
Colombian. And he would just his fingers he could barely move them after a week because they didn't
have machines yet then.
Geez I can imagine.
Hand counting five million dollars, you know, in 20s and 10s.
And that's where the stories started happening about how they weighed their their money.
Because in Florida, he went to a apartment building once and he said there'd be like
five apartments and they'd have a secret door in the closet that would link it to the next
apartment and to the next apartment so that if they had to bail, they could just disappear.
Yeah.
And he went into one apartment and he said it was Florida ceiling with tiny passageways in
the hallways of just money piled Florida ceiling every single room.
And he said there was millions of millions of dollars. And that was one of the kind of
places where they would just weigh money. Yeah.
Weigh, you know, and then send it back to Colombia.
That's so wild. And the responsibility of being the dude who has to count it because
like you get that shit wrong, you're going to be the first person they look at.
Right.
Not me.
When you're making friends in Brooklyn, the guy who was in charge, he goes by the nickname
Sata. He overpaid us once $2,000. And I know him. And he did it as a trick to see if we were
going to tell him and be honest.
Oh, interesting.
We counted the money a second time. And I said in his house in Brownsville. And I said,
you know, Sata, you're over by $2,000 singles. What? No, no, not even possible.
It was just messing with us because he wanted to.
We were it was early in our relationship. And he wanted to see if we were honest enough.
And we passed. We passed the test. So that was good.
Yeah, that's a good thing. Yeah, I used to do that with my spray,
like my reversal spray. I give it to different people and you know, give them different like,
yeah, you know, for this exchange or this exchange. And I knowing mostly that I was
never going to get anything but just kind of get a good gauge of who is going to just take it,
run with it, use it to make themselves a bunch of money or who would do you know, what they said.
It's a good way. I mean, it's a small loss, but it's a good way to judge a potential future
lifelong friend to. Yeah.
Cheap way to to figure out who you can trust. Absolutely. And to them,
into the other person, it's almost like from a greedy person's angle. It's like, well,
this one bottle could potentially make me, you know, several thousand dollars worth of feminized
seed. So is it worth the burn? You know, and a lot of times it is worth the burn to people.
Hmm. Yeah. Magic. Magic always says if there is a doubt about a person, then there is no doubt.
It's a good quote. That's a line from the movie Ronin and running. Yeah. And he says,
if there's a doubt, there is no doubt. And it's near the end of the movie. And that's when
you find out that he never quit and he was still working for the CIA or something. Yeah.
Robert De Niro. Right. Classical movie. But it's true. If you I treat my life that way,
if I have a doubt about something, I just go, I'll wait and see what the universe says. I,
I didn't do that when I was younger. You see, I would jump in with both feet. You know,
you seem to have a very magical, touched life, though. I mean, a lot of people,
you know, only live a fraction or see a fraction of what what you managed to get yourself wound up
in time and time again. And the fact is, you guys weren't outlaws as far as carrying guns
and being cowboys and stuff like that. You carried this very humble attitude. Yeah.
I had a great big throwing knife on my hip when I was doing it. And, you know, I don't know what
good that would do. But we specifically didn't. We knew other people. Some of the guys from Jerome,
they are all heavily armed and they would have barbed wire in the bushes and weird stuff.
You read about this in magazines. Yeah. And I was just going, that's that makes them instantly
dangerous criminals. Yeah. We were just hippies. I think it's criminals.
That's an important distinction to make, because I think we've chatted for long enough now that I
can safely say that everybody on this, this little this little call that we're doing is
is a weed nerd, you know, in that regard. And so for me, having been in a bunch of counterculture
kind of my whole life, I totally differentiate between like people who do certain substances,
but are otherwise like honorable and very good people. It's just some of the things they decided
to get into happen to not be societally acceptable. Right. Right. Then people that are like
actual criminals, you know, where it's and there's a big difference there because there's a lot of
people that are wonderful people. And the only thing that they do wrong, really, that could get
them into significant trouble is marijuana. Yeah. You know, and I and I was when I was listening to
you guys talk about some of the the transition into powders and stuff like that. One of the
things that I've always thought about is that like the weed game or the weed scene is inherently just
like less dangerous than that other world. Like when that other world started happening, maybe
it's because of the way it makes people think or the way people act or the money was so much bigger.
But it seemed to bring out a lot of like negative qualities in people that when you were in the
weed game existed, but maybe weren't like maybe weren't like accented quite so much. Right. You
know? Yeah. Well, my friends in Brooklyn, they would say I would open the door. He'd have a Mac
nine in his hand, you know, and he'd look around and make sure it was cool to let us in. But they
had they had plenty of weapons. But my friend Ricky, who is still my friend, I see him when I
go to New York. He lives in Brooklyn in the same apartment since 74. He never, ever had a gun.
The other Rastas did. And but he was he's a philosopher. He's a real gentle guy.
He's a good brother of mine. I've known him 40 years now. And he he's wonderful. I go have
curry goat with him whenever we're there. He takes me to a different restaurant. I love curry goat
and ackee and saltfish they have in those Caribbean neighborhoods. You know, you can still
get all that the restaurants. They cater to the people that live there. So it's very cool. I love
that stuff. I would say, too, like for Mendocino County, there's definitely people that have guns
that had the intention on using them, you know, if they were accosted by other humans. But there was
a lot of growers that had guns on them simply because they were in some remote spot on the hill.
And if they came across a bear with cubs or a mountain lion, they didn't want to just die.
Right. They wanted to have a fighting chance. So there was there was this idea of I'm alone
in the deep woods by myself. And this is not my territory. And there's bear and mountain lion and
other things that that I'm a lot weaker than even jaguars. Yeah. Yeah. Jaguars. Yeah. I mean,
even that I mean, mountain lions, you know, bears usually here, mountain lions, they've been
watching you for a while if you ever even know that they're there, you know, but we would encounter
all that that kind of stuff. Like a lot of times, all of a sudden something would go wrong with our
water and we'd have to walk the water line back to like the the cat, you know, the the spring box
that we had made or something. Right. And you're walking through deep woods totally alone.
You know, and you're in the deep woods and, you know, you don't have teeth or claws and you're not
super strong. So some people would have pistols or shotguns or something just to make themselves
feel OK when they're out there and sticks. Yeah. Dual Dobermans is is popular with some people.
I knew they had two Dobermans and they were you know, they went wherever they went. They had their
Dobermans and one's name was Tor and the other one was Tia Tortilla. I know. This one guy and
you know, they they were not quite command dogs, but they were close.
You would tell them to do something and they would just do it. Yeah. So and they'd sniff out a bear
or a bear would, you know, better let your dogs fight the bear than you. Yeah. I mean, in my era,
too, it became uncomfortable because the penalty for getting caught with a gun at a at a row was
actually like quite a bit worse than the grow itself. Yeah. And then it was kind of like a
do you risk it even because even if even if you were going to beat the case on a medical thing
or something like that later on with the grow, they'd be like, oh, no, he's a hardened criminal
armed. Right. He was ready to hurt people. And we caught him. Well, you know, that's what this is
from that Humboldt article. And they're pointing out this machine gun. Yeah. It says Humboldt
deputies sees this menacing array of weaponry, including an Uzi and an AK-47, along with
marijuana in raids on growers. You know, they love to point those out and make everybody think that
that's what most growers are doing. They do. Absolutely. They do. And some people, sadly,
I mean, when wherever there's profit involved, people get into it for different reasons.
Yeah. You know, and some of the people involved certainly were that I wouldn't classify it as
the majority, but certainly a percentage, you know. Yeah. Well, I'm in three humans.
I didn't feel real comfortable in Guadalajara to tell you the truth, because everyone was packing
in those. The guys carrying the beer were packing. I don't know. Just they that's their job. They
took us out to sushi in Guadalajara and it was some of the best sushi I've ever had in my life.
And they they were it was a lieutenant of Miguel's. He went by the name of Wapo,
which means handsome. And they took us out. And it was amazing because the guy who ran it,
he'd speak in Japanese to his crew. Then he turned to us and speak in English perfectly.
And then he turned and talked to these guys in Spanish. It was quite, quite amazing.
Yeah. So it doesn't fit in with the stereotype of the dump of the dumb stoner. Right.
Yeah. Oh, I mean, I think Americans are we're very we're very isolated because we've got
Canadians who also speak English for the most part, besides the people in Quebec
above us. And we've got two oceans next to us. But I think a lot of parts of the world
are multilingual just because they encounter so many different languages as part of their
daily life. And in America, we are we're kind of broken from that in a bit. You know,
my Swiss family speaks five languages perfectly. Yeah. I have an aunt who's Swiss and she speaks
for. And so much so. Yes, very much so. And I I actually kind of regret that because I think the
younger you learn language, the more fluent and fluid you are in speaking and reading it.
And I think Americans a lot of times like it does something to your brain to be able to speak
multiple languages and communicate. You know, I think it's super cool. Yeah. So we have the story
of the peyote prince. Can you briefly or maybe not even briefly, can you tell us what a peyote
prince is? One of their they're both I don't know how they came into this, but they both knew Sam
and Sam was a road chief in the Native American church on the Navajo Reservation.
And he had a license that allowed him to go to northern Mexico across the border from Texas.
And he'd come back with a quarter million or a half a million of peyote buttons for the church,
where actually 90 percent of it wasn't going to the church. It was going to these two guys.
Yeah. And they would one lived in Tempe, two blocks from the police station, and the other one
lived in Cottonwood, Arizona. And that's where I lived at the time.
And these were fresh buttons, so they had to dry them. So the guy in Tempe had date racks that they
dry dates in, and it was perfect for peyote. And if you went into his little old house in Tempe,
you had to turn sideways to go down the hallways or go into any room. In this case,
it wasn't stacks of money. It was just stacks of date trays drying 200,000 buttons.
And once they dried, if you've seen them, they look like little flat discs and almost like jerky,
you know, like a little piece of jerky. But don't be fooled until you taste them.
And they would just sell. This was 1973 when I was first in Arizona, and
you could get them as low as a nickel a button if you bought a certain amount. Yeah. And then
you could sell them for a quarter. So in Illinois, in Coggo, all over the United States, these two
guys had friends who would come to Arizona and get them. I don't think they shipped in UPS or in
the mail. People always took them. One of my friends gave a guy 200, and he was going through
custom or through the gate to go to his flight. This was about 1980, I'm thinking, in Phoenix,
or maybe it was 78, somewhere in there. And he looked back to see his friend leaving, and one
of the security guys was holding the bag of peyote up in the air and looking at it. And he
asked him, what are these? And he said, they're peyotes, they're cactus seeds. And the guy looked
at him and went, oh, okay. And he gave it back to him. It wasn't even in their radar and their
training yet at that point. Sure. The princes were amazing. I know both of them still, they're still
both alive. And one of them isn't as healthy as the other, but they were, you know, it was just an
amazing thing that millions and millions of buttons they sold. And some of them were diverted
to Redway. The guy there, two of my friends would drive 50 to 70,000 buttons to up to Northern
California, and they would get turned into mescaline sulfate, pure. And mescaline is only
like 40%, I think, some number like that of the alkaloids in peyote. That's the one that everyone
knows. And then they even call it mescaline, you know, or whatever. But there's many other
alkaloids that are significant in a peyote journey. But when you extract just the mescaline
sulfate, then it's a different journey. And I did them both. And I compared it to the mescaline
sulfate was like peyote without the teacher. Because you take peyote or experience it, there's
this inner voice. It's hard to describe, but you it seems like it's someone else, but it's you
actually. It's your inner consciousness. You're hearing your thoughts in a way that it sounds like
it's an external voice. Oh, yeah, I've never done peyote. It's, it's, let me, I'm terrified of
throwing up. So well, let me let me interject something here. My, my experience with peyote
is probably a lot less than yours. But I will say that the buttons were some of the more bitter
things that I ever intentionally swallowed in my life. So I can see how the mescaline pills
might might go down a little smoother for some people, because you really have to be like, okay,
this is going to be good for me. Because they don't taste good. It's not as bitter as wormwood,
but it's right up there. It's pretty intense bitter. I mean, I remember that was that's my
strongest memory of trying to consume them was like, man. Yeah. Yeah. There was people doing
peyote elements to avoid it going into their gut. That was big in the area. Mostly a couple ladies.
Yeah, they would make tea and then just do an animal and then you would have this wonderful
trip and never throw up. You don't get any discomfort because you get your gut.
You're stuck. Yeah. I mean, like I've I've I've done ayahuasca in Brazil.
Booths all the time. Good Lord, I do not. But I will say that when you when you are like,
you know, meeting your creator or whatever, and you're and you're super fired up,
having your stomach hurt and having to purge any which way you have to purge is pretty intense.
Yeah. And I remember when I did it in Brazil, I had to run out and I had to do it. I had to
get rid of some things outside of myself in the jungle. And I really wanted a bright American
clean bathroom because I felt so exposed, just like running in the dark and and that experience
of other people. Yeah. South America, very intense. And, you know, peyote, it doesn't
feel good digesting some of those alkaloids you were discussing. Your body is not ready
to digest them comfortably. Yeah. So sometimes chocolate mescaline and the stuff that was being
sold on the Hill and Boulder was not mescaline. Even at the low price of five or six or eight
cents a button when this was being made by that. That wizard chemist in northern California, it it
enough to get you high would cost you ten dollars. So these one and two dollar hits of chocolate
mescaline were just LSD. Yeah. Oh, wow. Powder makes them because unless you paid her ten,
fifteen dollars and the pictures of his photos on my on one of my chronicles, they look like
pickup sticks about an inch long, sharp needles. If you poured them out of a bottle, they would
just pile up in these sharp needle looks and they'd have to be crushed into a powder to put
them in a cap. We just ate some of the crystals once. And but the guy who said, you know, if you're
measuring this out, a good trip would be ten to fifteen dollars. So very few people have actually
even seen or done mescaline sulfate. This is the point. I agree with you. I would even say in my
era when I was experimenting with that stuff, it's almost all relabeled LSD. Yeah. You know,
it just was. Yeah. Most people haven't experienced it because the the buttons are hard to come by and
they taste gross and and people are just marketing to a different thing. So they're like, oh, yeah,
here's some mescaline. But it was some really good advice you gave in one of your stories,
Jack, about juicing. But can you talk about that a little bit? Well, the last time I did
it, I juiced 50 buttons, fresh buttons and a lot. Yeah. Yes. Ten is you eat ten fresh buttons. If
you could get those down, you will have a really strong journey. Oh, wow. We took 50 and juice
them. And I had a quart bottle of beautiful emerald green liquid. And my friend who is the
tall fellow, my first girl partner, he drank a third of the bottle and I drank two thirds of
the bottle. And he spent the whole night face down on his sleeping bag. He never moved for like 10
hours. And I would ask him a question and he wouldn't answer. And then about three or four
minutes later, he go, no, it was a time lag. It was really funny. And I had a fire going and I
was saying, let's go for a hike. Let's do this. And he just he was immobilized. But he had a good
when he woke up in the morning, he said, I had the strangest dreams.
So he did enjoy it, though, like the movie Young Guns, Estevez and all those young
kids stars. There's a scene in there where they eat peyote. Yeah. And they're the one guy shooting
his gun wildly out at this mining claim and in the what other guys talking and you hear his voice,
but he's not talking. And whoever produced that movie has done peyote because they knew about the
voice. It's so clear in that scene. I was just amazed that someone had or they had a technical
advisor that knew that that's how they would do it because he was stumbling around and you could
hear this voice talking to him. Yeah, it was good. I managed tried to get me to talk about psychedelics
on the show, and I've kind of kept it weed focused. But I will say that sometimes when when things get
very intense, you're kind of locked in your own mind. Like if your friend was laying down,
what they're experiencing and feeling and thinking is so intense, you just lose track of the fact
that you have legs and arms and you can't really interact with the world because you have so much
sensory data that's coming into your brain. And you're thinking about so many things that like
all that other stuff is extraneous to some degree, you know, and that that's common. I've
seen that on mushrooms on LSD on high doses of different things, where you just end up kind of
in your own head. You know, it's not a very physical thing. It's a very inward thing. Yeah.
You know, so sometimes that's good. And sometimes that's bad, but it usually is, is, is positive
long term, you know, as long as you got a safe space and you're with friends.
Yep. Set and setting is everything. Yeah. And I think I think for episode three, we might
adventure maybe if you're open to it, maybe make that more of the full expansive psychological
psychedelic aspect of your life, the spiritual journey that that brought mad jag to this point,
because we're buttoned up against the end. And I know like for those who are watching this,
we recorded this around right around Christmas time. Everybody's kind of squeezing in hours to
get them in. So I also wanted to really thank you guys for spending your time with us and every
everyone in the audience on Christmas. So yeah, it's an honor, man, and a pleasure. And I'm so
glad that we I was able to convince Raho to join in the way he has because I met him for the first
time last year. I've been we've been face to face on face to face, but we've been friends for since
around 2012 on the forums. And it was just a gas to meet him. And oh, I bet I'm glad. And to see
him sit with people talking about strains and varieties. There is only one other person, a guy
who goes by the name Sattva who's in Boulder, who's can tell you about 30 different types of
Colombian. And he's been growing Colombian in Boulder for like 30 years. Oh, man, like 10
different Punta Roja strains. I mean, he and he goes to these places. He's he his wife speaks
Spanish. He speaks some and they go down to Guerrero a lot along the coast in little towns
you can only get to by boat. Oh, wow. Yeah. And he's posted some photos. And yeah, he's he was
joining us, too. I can say from my perspective that first Matt will tell you it takes a lot to
shut me up. And I try to talk as little as possible. But I burn with questions almost
every third sentence that you or Rahul talk about. And I try to afterwards write down various
questions and ideas that I have. And so it's really cool that we're having like this multi stage
thing because an hour or two after we do these things, I get I'm like, Oh, my God, why didn't I
I want to follow up on that so bad. I got to remember, you know, because there's this off handed
comment and, you know, conversations go in different directions. And you don't always get
to follow up on stuff. And we like free flowing. But there's a wealth. There's a wealth of
information and just enjoyable convo here. So I'm super stoked. Well, remember this for next time,
pay phones and quarters. Pay phones and quarters. Pay phones and quarters. Because that's how we
had to communicate. I'd call my phone. Oh, yeah. That was my that was my we ever talk about the
psychedelic aspect. That was my era. Pay phones and quarters. Do you know what a chinger is?
Yeah, yeah. It's a black box. It's to make it. Yeah. So what we did when we were on dead tour
is we someone discovered that when you put quarters into a pay phone, the pay the pay,
the company actually knows what coin you're putting in by the tone. Right. So a dime is one
tone and nickel is one tone. A quarter is one tone. Somebody got the clever idea that you could
get these little recorders from Radio Shack that recorded about 30 seconds and you could record
them and you could just push in quarters into the thing and record. Right. And then when you go to
make a long distance call, yes, you know, you we would so we would use pay phones and and all these
different things and like, you know, tell each other where we're going to be at what time of day
and what hour and call us not as a boomer. He calls them chingers. Us young men call them black
boxes. You hold it up to the mouthpiece of the phone and hit play and it would make the sound
of the coins falling into the machine. And eventually, eventually the phone company caught
on to it and you would get an operator going, sir, hello, hello. Yeah. And you would have to bail. But
you know, yeah, it that was that was before cell phones when pay phones were everywhere.
Nine dollars and 90 cents for three minutes to Cali, Columbia from in 1982. And the operators
were going, what? And, you know, I yeah, it was I used a lot of quarters. But my friend in Manhattan,
one of the three brothers of the weed people, he would buy a thousand dollars worth at a time at
a bank and he had a cart and he'd bring them out. He'd load up his car. And whenever he go out,
he just put like 10 rolls in his pockets because, you know, never know how many phone calls you're
going to have to make and how long because he was always calling to different states.
Yeah. Hey, phones. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. You know, a little spy versus spy on that level. They were
safer. You know, they were safer, especially if you rotated and didn't use the same ones all the
time. It always sucked following not so though, after a pay phone, because they're just so sticky.
I just cannot do it that way. See, he's got two in this episode. He didn't get one last time,
so he's bummed. It's really practically three with the whole boofing thing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm
glad someone remembered that one. And, you know, especially we are at the bottom. We're at almost
two hours here. Yeah. So, Matt, if you want to plug anything and and we'll keep we'll keep this
thing going. I mean, there's a lot of paths we can go down and we still only scratch the surface
on some of it. Yeah. I mean, we made it to map one nineteen seventy nine. So I think, yeah,
next round we're going to go to the nineteen eighty map and then continue on. We have our
merch up. Go check out syndicate gear dot com. You guys, Raho, anything? You know, this was a
great episode. I like we kind of focused on the Mad Jag stuff. And, you know, if we maybe we can
organize or, you know, get a little bit of a game plan to limit or focus discussions that way,
we won't spin off so much. We'll be able to drill down on the upcoming ones. But now, you know,
maybe with all this discussion about old Mexicans, I'd maybe give a shout out to one of my boys,
Cryptic Labs, who has a great reputation for his walk in lines that these are stuff that he's
collected back in the 80s and has preserved and shared and is turning out great lines today. He's
just done a kind of a dug out a fresh batch of old seeds and has done a selection on them and
has found a couple of amazing phenos that I think he'll be coming out with soon. So Cryptic Labs
for the old Max. Awesome. Yeah. Besides that, just looking forward to more and
some of my own stuff to throw in there. What was your link to the clothing and stuff?
Syndicate gear dot com. Oh, so excellent. And I was going to toss in a quick thing to
Zomia Collective out of Thailand. They have some amazing old Landrace ties. The squirrel tail,
the red string tie, the daideng, or I don't want to mispronounce it. Anyways. Yeah, they ship very
fast. And I got my stuff, which is not always easy when, you know, sending money out of the
country. So props to them. People looking for Landrace stuff. It's a good place. Not so.
I all I have to say is that I'm excited on these conversations. And as always, I'm very happy for
anyone that takes the time to listen to us ramble on about a weed and history and culture and all
that. So thank you all very much. All right. Our pleasure. Guys. Yeah. Have a great holiday. We'll
see you right out. Happy holidays for sure. Happy holidays. If you want to sit at the table with
us, check out our Patreon and our link tree or description below. Our merch site is officially
