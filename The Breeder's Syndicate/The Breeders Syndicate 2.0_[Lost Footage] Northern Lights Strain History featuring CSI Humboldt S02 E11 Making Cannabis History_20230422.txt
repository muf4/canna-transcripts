hello bastards and bastardettes how we doing settled in here for the thingy
today the fucking thingy so as you saw I think we're gonna have CSI humble come
stop by whenever I you may not show up at the very beginning but he'll be here
at some point and we will go over what he saw in the NL reproduction and let me
get not so in here or do I have to do them both same time I can't remember
let's see so we'll keep our eyes peeled for when CSI pops up you guys let me
know wasabi I need to teach you how to use a camera
the fucking mean teach any camera as my own heads cut off yeah there's a
professional called headspace that you need to get there you go this is a
perfect I'm just analyzing my shit you just super anal dude I like logged in
and like your shit was like aiming at the wall I know I started I start off
with a scenery of my my ceiling you do yeah cuz nobody wants to see my fucking
face the first time they jump in I want to traumatize anyone I want to be I
wanted to be smooth yeah all right so
trying to think of how to start this uh well I don't know what you said cuz I
just popped I haven't said anything we're hoping managing technical
difficulties and whatnot that we might be able to get CSI on to chat about some
stuff yeah and this this Friday evening we kind of decided that we were going to
maybe sort of merge something that's current going on right now with some
historical shit yeah right and we had an excellent opportunity to do that in the
in the nl5 project that Matt and and CSI have been up to an nl5 probably
needs no introduction in the sense that it's probably like one of the most
famous terms in all of cannabis yeah but there's a lot of legend behind it and
there's a lot of misinformation behind it and so we thought for this episode
maybe we could sort of like take you guys through like how it started some of
the history to it and a lot of this stuff has been chatted about in various
ways and shapes and forms but we thought it might be interesting to sort of like
coalesce it all into one show yeah and start from back then and sort of bring
it into the now because modern times yeah because you know so I mean I've
done I've helped with some like 90s stuff and it makes me feel old but you
know the 90s is like 30 plus years ago now and the 80s when all this shit was
happening was 40 plus years ago now so most people in cannabis have heard about
nl5 but it's mostly just legends and there's a lot of misinformation and a
lot of funny cuts and a lot of odd stories and so we kind of thought we'd
just chat about those kind of aspects a little bit and sort of merge the history
with a little bit of the project that these guys are doing because they tie in
together they do that's kind yeah I mean where do we want to start uh you know we
can start with maybe I'll start maybe we can start with just the generalization
you know and then we'll start with some history so the reason why everybody
knows what nl5 is in my opinion is because of Neville right Neville
popularized it he picked a selection and he used the nl5 and a bunch of famous
crosses one of which was probably the most famous line of all time that nl5
hates yes and then other groups and Canadian seed banks and all these
different things started using the name nl5 nl5 right yeah and it just sort of
became part of the fabric of cannabis history yeah if you will right and
there's a lot misunderstood about it or whatever but it's probably one of the
most recognizable terms in cannabis yeah I think even people like my parents my
mom my dad was who he was with weed but my mom had nothing to do with it she
wanted nothing to do with it never learned it and even she is sort of
Northern Lights as a strip and Northern Lights and Northern Lights 5 and all
that and so now what we've got going on is is I've joked on previous episodes or
whatever that like when I was trying to collect a lot of old stuff it was almost
impossible but now we're kind of in this wave of you know famous things from the
80s and 90s you know or in any form they might exist in has got a resurgence
yeah of popularity and interest and people want to see what's up with you
know what was once common becomes legendary yeah right is really is kind
of what it boils down to and so for anyone that came into the weed scene
later when nl5 was already kind of a myth you know you know hopefully we can
like clear up a bunch of stuff because there's a lot of there's a lot of people
that are talking about the name yeah right yeah so when we tell this tale
let's go ahead and start with there was a man named Herbie sure and Herbie went
to a certain hair salon where the Northern Light crew hung out and he
would go to they would go to this hair salon and commune and smoke weed and
talk stuff well this guy named Herbie came in and he was a veteran and he
wanted to be able to grow and make a living for himself so they set him up
with some lights and some some of the original Steve Murphy Afghani seeds and
he had some of his own different hybrids he was working with mostly Colombian and
Mexican I believe that was the quote yeah and and he he was the one who
selected this nl5 clone from or from his own work with the Steve Murphy Afghan
and the Hawaiian so yeah I mean probably the the way that people can understand
it the best is that there was a loose collective group of friends you know you
know acquaintances whatever in the Pacific Northwest area yeah Herbie was
one there was a guy named some some people call him the Indian was another
one Steve Murphy was a different one there was you know a there was a number
of different characters all involved at various points and so it was a mostly
everyone has to remember that in that time in the early 80s almost everything
in America was still sativa and blends of different sativas because all the all
the weed that came into America was seeded sativa weed right yeah so the
core of everybody starting to breed was you got three seeds with your sativa
weed lots of them and the rare shit was indica because indica made hash hash
didn't come with free seeds and so indica seeds were really hard to acquire
they came from people on the hippie hashish trail people like Sam skunk man
and Neville and others made trips to Afghanistan which in that era was
extremely difficult to do it's dangerous and they started bringing back small
amounts of seeds so unlike sativa that was getting sativa seeds spread out all
over America in every kilo that was sold indica seeds were hard to come by
yeah so the NL story starts with a very small handful of seeds of pure indica
that came from this dude named Steve Murphy yeah right and then of course
just like anybody the group in the Pacific Northwest up there started
making hybrids of this stuff they crossed it to itself they crossed it to
everything else they had and the the famous numbers of NL basically you know
connotate like the lower the number the more indica and the shorter it was yeah
so the one two three four were you know predominantly indica based and smaller
and you start getting into five six seven eight nine ten eleven and they
start getting more and more sativa now Matt's already interviewed one of the
main characters in the in this thing and he basically stated that they took
that Steve Murphy Afghan and they crossed it to every sativa they could
get their hands on so Hawaiians Mexicans Colombians Thai and you said Indians
blends of those things hybrids of those things all back and forth right yeah so
the NL five they had this buddy named Herbie who got involved and Herbie had a
Hawaiian okay and this Hawaiian was you know he crossed he it got crossed to the
Steve Murphy Afghan and the it got called NL five for its position and the
height and the blend of sativa versus indica or whatever and they found a
pheno that they really really liked so NL five initially was a seed line
created within that little crew and then Herbie gave back to the NL crew like
this select pheno that he was super excited about and so the as best we can
tell it's a pure Afghan from Steve Murphy on the one side and a Mexican
Colombian we believe on the other side that was called a Hawaiian because it
was called a Hawaiian because it was grown in Hawaii but there is no
indigenous Hawaiian weed yeah most Hawaiian weed was Mexican Colombian a
blend of those two or a blend of those two with Afghan right so you know and
then as you know as the story's been told this gentleman sent Neville a a
whole bunch of seeds all numbered right yeah and I don't know if you have any of
those catalogs handy but Neville's story is that Neville story is that he
was you know he did a lot of work with them and a lot of them as we found out
were a mess because they were a blend of indica's and and sativas yeah but in
this one seed of NL five out of a bunch of indica sativa hybrids and a mess he
found this plant that was what he called a pure indica throwback that
showed zero sativa influence yeah it was short it was squat it was leafy it was
covered in frost it didn't have a lot of smell and so he started crossing this to
things and it crossed amazingly well with basically everything he threw on it
yeah so the legend of NL five was born because he crossed it to skunk one and
he crossed it to NL he crossed it to Hayes and he crossed it to NL two and he
crossed it to a few other things it started showing up in polyhybrids he
made like silver pearl yeah and it just sort of became one of the building
blocks of his genetic library and since he was one of the first dudes that had a
seed bank anything that he had that he threw into a bunch of crosses kind of
went everywhere yeah right and all these things are winning high times you know
stuff and it's getting big glossy pictures and NL five Hayes was the most
popular strain they sold so the legend of it just took off now there's a debate
here because what what's indisputable is that he went to the States and he got
the Pacific Northwest hash plant and the and the g-13 through friends of another
guy who's pretty famous named Jorge Cervantes some friends of his hooked
him up and he arranged for the cutting that the guys in the Pacific Northwest
were growing as NL five to be shipped over right yeah and so they did this
they did this clever thing where they shipped this plant over in a terrarium
of other plants and they took scissors and they cut the serrations off the
edges of each of the pot leaves so it didn't look like wheat that's sick huh
that's a good idea they just shaved all that off so it looked unusual and if
Neville is posted back when he used to post on mr. nice that he didn't like
that one as much because it wasn't as consistent of a breeder as the one he
found amongst the seed line yeah so he didn't use it yeah so right there you
have this massive confusion where everybody thinks NL five is the same
thing where it is kind of the same thing but there's a seed line that never got
out there's a clone that they selected from that seed line that was popular in
Washington yeah and there's a clone that Neville found amongst seeds they sent to
him and they all got called NL five yes and that's where a lot of the confusion
lies yeah so people think they'll be like oh I've got the same clone that
Neville used and all of his breeding but it never left the west coast yeah well
no cuz Neville says he found it in seed yeah you know so there was there was two
select cuttings even early and you know most people don't realize this but
Neville says his was like a total Afghan throwback and the one that that the
Seattle crew describes had like two foot colas on it right yeah that's right long
running lime green colas well yes and no yes and no if I remember if I remember
it was stated that they combined different buds to make it look like it
had a massive Cola for Neville in the Jesus yeah so that was there was some
fun stuff going on there was some shenanigans perhaps yes shenanigans
abound there was some shenanigans so there's a so yeah I mean there's an
aspect where I'm sorry I'm looking down for a second cuz Matt didn't have his
catalog handy I know I always do too but I do I don't know if there's a bigger
version of this but if everyone wants to look that picture right there that is
a picture of the mother cut taken in Amsterdam and put in the sensei seeds
catalog taken when it won a cup in 1995 it was printed in the 96 catalog that is
a that is one of the few existing pictures of an actual growing nl5 that
Neville used and you can see it's short it's squat it's leafy as fuck you know
it's got all these things going on to it and so you know so nl5 Neville said that
nl5 was prop nl5 Hayes was probably the most famous and best-selling thing in
his whole catalog both at his seed bank and later at sensei yeah the nl5 skunk
one got renamed I don't know if it was renamed Shiva Shiva skunk yeah I think
it was renamed Shiva skunk at sensei seeds but it was sold the whole time so
probably it was sold from 87 or 88 all the way through you know 1999 or the
early 2000s still probably to this day but it's not the same shit yeah and nl5
Hayes was sold consistently so you know it just kind of entered into the lexicon
everybody knows nl5 Hayes yeah and it's gotten old enough now that a bunch of
people are like oh I have it I have the original cut I have the this I have the
bat so you know you know and and and you know it it someone's saying nothing
about the nl crew telling Neville that I mean Neville you know Neville spoke
about the nl but he basically like has said that he just got he just got these
labeled seeds and he made his own inferences about you know so yeah you
know he had he had to make it up basically like he had to think what am
I seeing yeah and then you know the guys back then that it was in the 80s and
they were all scared of getting busted so they didn't really take copious
notes no and then yeah that was the example times you know and we actually
know a bit more about the nl5 than we know about a lot of the other nl numbers
because of what Herbie was working with and what he said he crossed to the Steve
Murphy to get that nl5 yeah so it's like a lot of things you know I mean a lot of
a lot of a lot of greetings are collaborative it's a small group of
friends doing one part at my garage and you do the next part of yours and this
and that and everything else and who's responsible for it there might be one or
two people that gets known for it but in reality there's a whole little group
that's involved yeah it was a kind of small group yeah right
yep so you know and then you know when it comes to nl5 Hayes Neville claims
that right before he left sensei about 95 ish they lost the mother of nl5 don't
and it makes kind of sense because if you like there's a bunch of nl5 Hayes
cuts that still are kept in amp in America especially in the New York
region and in Amsterdam and they all are basically from 88 to 95 yeah you know
there's not really people aren't really like oh I got this one in 2002 but there
was a lot of fire in those seven or eight years that they were able to marry
those two plants together yeah you know and then you know super silver Hayes and
stuff like that was kind of Neville's attempt to blend the three most famous
Amsterdam lines together which was nl skunk and Hayes and so you know now we
have this whole thing where everything gets different names and different
nicknames and tons of shit has nl or skunk or Hayes blended into it yeah but
you might not know because it doesn't have that name attached yeah you know
no someone said I assumed it was phenos of one to nine no it was different
hybrids so nl1 was almost pure Afghan nl2 was another Afghan that they
actually got like a kush type Afghan from the Indian and they blended that to
Steve Murphy yeah three and four sort of lost a time nobody has them but they
were also you know they started increasing amounts of sativa and five
through eleven were just the nl crews crossing that Afghan to different
sativas yeah and you know the more the higher the number the taller the plant
the more sativa influenced yeah right yep that's how we know it so if you
look around at some of Neville's early catalogs you can see him playing around
he uses the eight he uses the five he uses the nine he's got the one and the
two you know all these different things and then after three or four years he
decided basically that he was only gonna breed with the one the two and the one
cutting of the five that he found yeah and so all these other hybrids kind of
go away because probably because they were mixes of extreme sativas with
indica's and they were probably a lot more of a pain in the ass for a breeder
to tame yeah and he did have high high as far as his keepers he did use a
rigorous selection so he didn't keep he went through a lot of seeds yeah and the
Indian I believe the Indian was Native American but I can't say that for sure
but he was he was Native American but he was he was part of the Pacific Northwest
crew yeah and a lot of these guys aren't aren't well known and don't want to be
in the well-known because in the 80s especially in the late 80s there was a
series of rolling busts and they all got in trouble yeah so it was a hard time to
be a cultivator you know getting a green merchant yeah yeah and all that it was
there was a lot of persecution back then there was a lot of secrecy back then
that's part of why they didn't keep copious notes because they didn't want
them to be used against them in a court of law later on and so you know but
basically I say I think it's fair to say that the reason why everybody knows nl
5 is because of Neville that I think that's fair I think everybody agrees
with that too because he and even like the Seattle guys will say that if they
hadn't sent it to Neville it likely would have been lost yeah because they
went through a rolling series of busts and had issues yeah you know so it so it
was sold at Neville seed bank for a number of years and then it was sold at
Scentsy for a number of years after that never pure right always a hybrid
scum one haze and l2 silver pearl other polyhybrids blended together but never
really by itself yeah so there was a pure seed line of nl5 but nobody got it
it wasn't sold they didn't make it to out of Amsterdam it was given to like a
couple people and even like even great you know even like some of the Seattle
guys said that there was a couple of cuts that got out the eight the nine and
maybe one of and maybe one of the twos from the Indian but nothing else yeah
so the five survived because it went to Amsterdam basically yeah it's the only
reason to survive that's the only reason why it survived so if you listen to the
Seattle crew they had one version of nl5 that they kept as a cutting and kind
of cropped out Neville found a breeder that he kept you know yeah and you know
it kind of it kind of went into it kind of went into legend you know and so you
know and so yeah I see all kinds of people what's up with this person's nl1
what's up with this nl5 what happened is is because it became so famous okay two
things happened one is that in Amsterdam anytime anything gets famous
people get seeds of it and they white label it yeah right and they offer up
their own versions of it okay and then on top of that when the Canadian seed
companies got involved they ended up buying a bunch of stuff from Amsterdam
blending it to Canadian strains and claiming that they had these things for
sales purposes yeah you know so you get and and they all have sort of dodgy
history yeah when it comes to provenance what I've what I've told you so far is
pretty much factually agreed to by the people that sent it to Neville and
Neville yeah and people around Neville yeah you know and then it gets famous
and there's a proliferation of people and seed banks that claim to have
various stuff but they weren't passing out this cutting to other people no they
weren't sharing it just so other people in different continents could like make
their own seeds with it it wasn't like today where people were trading seeds
back and forth no you know and yeah clones back and forth especially to
competitors you know the Dutch are extremely business oriented very they're
not going to just like bro out yeah that's why Matt's laughing because they
very are very much business oriented if they have a cut and everyone else wants
it and they're breeding off it and making money there's not really a chance
they're gonna share that fucking thing and there's a definite chance everybody's
gonna say that they have it yeah there's a definite chance that everyone's gonna
say they have it and they're gonna use that name any name that becomes famous
and cannabis gets used yeah you know so someone asked about you know and so that's kind of like
that's kind of where nl5 you know just got crossed to some very famous things and Neville
made some very fucking famous lines off it and there wasn't that much weed strains back then
and the combination of that and high times being like the premiere magazine in the 90s and you get
all these high-quality glossy photos and all the the cannabis cups and there was only one
cannabis cup a year yeah so this shit got hella famous legendary you know yeah and you know one
and what about another one what's that what about nl1 Oh didn't all these question oh I didn't see
it I mean nl1 is probably the closest thing to Steve Murphy Afghan it's it's it's got a little
bit of discrepancy between the guys involved as to what exactly is in it yeah but you know it's
good that's kind of irrelevant because what actually got sold is what got sent to Neville
and everybody should know that Neville got it in in in 84 85 and spent two or three years seeing
what he had so if you bought Northern Lights in 85 or 86 or even 87 from his catalog it was a
fucking hodgepodge of any of the lines all blended together yeah it wasn't until about 88 that it
wasn't about I'm gonna turn off my light because people are bitching it wasn't about till 88 that
he started coming out with nl1 nl2 and nl5 yeah right and you know and so and then so then these
numbers get attached I think 1989 late 88 is when nl5 Hayes got released yeah and nl5 skunk one and
nl5 this and so nl1 nl2 you know when it went to sensei you know they just called nl1 Northern
Lights yeah and they called nl2 Hindu Kush and so lots of people got nl because it was one of the
most common things sold yeah sorry I had to screenshot something that's funny no yeah it's
hard I mean people ask questions sometimes I'll get it sometimes not it's really hard to like
pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time so like I try to chat about something and
sound like you know fairly have a have some flow and then I read a question and I think about it
and all of a sudden I'm not talking and I'm just staring at the screen so forgive me for all that
you know if I miss a little ADHD yeah if I miss your question I'm sorry it's just the way it works
so you know I've chatted about this a bunch before on some of the previous podcasts and a little bit
more detail but that's what got it famous that is the story that is the story and so now anytime
anything becomes famous you know it's kind of like music or fashion or something like that it gets
fucking recycled right like it gets old and most people don't know about it and then all of a
sudden people are like I've got this ancient nl5 cut and I'm making beans with it I've got this
this you know you know and maybe maybe Matt you could explain the booth cut or the the new cut I
don't know I've never talked to Bodie about that one and I keep me to ask him because people ask
it a lot but I don't know the the history on that one so I mean people you know and you know people
asked about Bob Hemphill and you know and and the NL and stuff like that and so people have been
people you know it's really hard when you get see when you get seeds and lines that are that are 25
30 years old plus provenance on it becomes difficult yeah right you know apparently you
know Hemphill used to work in with the coastal seeds collective and apparently you know he got
it through some friend of cog use you know but nl1 was sold for you know what probably 20 years
yeah for a long time for a long time it was it was sold it was and there was never a specific
cut I mean Neville had some breeding males that he used nl1 and nl2 and Neville's thing was almost
always males yeah they were part of his breeding males and so it wasn't like nl5 well while never
Neville just had one cutting that had to be kept alive yeah nl1 was kind of like a line yeah and
so any like Durban poison or something right yeah so anytime there's a line it's a lot harder to
lose the line than it is when you're dependent on one specific cut to stay alive and keep going yeah
and the other thing is because these these fucking Dutch guys are such businessmen when you're not
sharing a cut amongst your homies and your good friends it exponentially increases the chance that
some kind of disease or accident or drought or worker error is gonna kill your fucking cut that
greed will get you and then you haven't shared it so it gets lost right yep you know and so Ben and
Alan drunkers aren't generous people no they weren't sharing they weren't sharing shit with
anybody you know and you know so I don't know I mean it it nl5 is super famous nl is super famous
that we went through probably a 10-year period where nobody gave a shit probably starting right
around the kush sour going into cookie era yeah where old things were just old and unpopular right
yeah it's just yeah things like Northern Lights skunk one these were a cheese things that that
like people are kind of looking at now like oh they got the fucking cheese they got that big like
if I saw that in a store with tons of clones and you know the early mid-2000s it's like huh I give
me some of that new shit nobody was worried about that cuz it was so abundant oh no I mean we had
it I can't remember who said it but it's absolutely true you know 15-20 years ago you bought seeds
from Nirvana gypsy Nirvana and you got free skunk one seeds because he might as well because you had
so many of them and it was so common it was you know you had to give them away yeah cuz nobody
wanted to buy them yeah it was super abundant and so there's a thing where everything's so common
why would anyone want it and people's tastes and change you know people's you know taste changes
and then it becomes rare and then people want it again yeah but most people in cannabis don't hold
on to anything unless it's currently profitable so what once becomes we've we've seen it over and
over and over and over again you know where something that was once abundant becomes uber
rare or lost a ton like I'll say it straight up if it you know hopefully he pops on here this
evening but if it wasn't for CSI loving the urkel and breeding with it a ton most people wouldn't
have access to it yeah his prolific breeding is probably the reason why that genetics survived
yeah and I'm not saying he's the only person that held it no but he but yeah it got I used to know
I mean we're not gonna talk about purples very long here tonight but like I used to know dozens
upon dozens of growers 15 years ago that ran urkel and you and then diesel and kush gets popular and
like six people held on to it yeah literally yeah it's yeah that's how it goes dude and it's not and
and the reason why I brought that up is because that's how super skunk became almost extinct
that's how nobody can find the the dead skunk turps that's how all these things become rare or
hoarded or extinct is they're so common nobody thinks they need to care to preserve it and then
hippies and growers start looking around at who's got that old school and they can't fucking find it
and a lot of times the name game happens it'll get a different name or you know someone makes seeds
with it and he has a different name that it carries on with so people don't even know to look in that
direction for said one of these baselines yeah we've talked about that before too where I love
the counterculture aspect of Americans giving weed nicknames yeah but for lineage it's a real pain in
the ass no it's terrible because we take whatever the name of the actual thing is and it gets a
nickname and then it goes to a different crew and they give it a different fucking nickname yeah and
then it goes to this other crew and they give it a spin on that name yeah and then 20 years goes by
and you're trying to trace what the hell it is yeah plain telephone you gotta go through four
or five nicknames back and then you get to the core thing and then you and then the trail goes
dry so you know I mean so now after 10 or 15 years of nobody giving a shit about Northern Lights it's
hot yeah people want to try these ancient things that they grew up when they were kids reading
about or these the first week the first like true famous week yeah you know they want to see
what's up they want to see what's up with it and you know and so now because there's interest now
all of a sudden where there's interest there's economy and people start popping up with yeah
all over the place and most people probably don't know that there was two completely distinct cuts
that were used one from America and one from home yeah and there was a seed line but it was
given out to nobody and then you see stuff where I've got nl5 pure well how yeah lots of that right
how yeah you know you know I mean you can you can talk you can you can know that that Neville had it
pure because the guy that made it says I sent it to him pure along with the rest of it yeah and
Neville says I got it pure from dude okay they both agree here's when I sent it it exists but
did you share with anybody no so everybody has a bunch of hybrids or Canadians got it and sold
their shit and then people get it and it's got a name attached and they're like you know there it
is yeah you know and because we're cannabis and because all of our stories are kind of black
market or underground or prohibition it gets really difficult to sometimes it comes down to
who you choose to believe yeah and that's a lot of the time with a lot of these strains and so
some people will get like NL and they'll and the guy will be like I've had this for 30 years and
never left the west coast it's it's this yeah and they're like great it's this that's all the proof
I need mm-hmm let's start breeding with it and it's this and now it's labels all over the place
and people are buying it and is it that one thing one thing I also noticed was that during the
Phylos era a lot of people would get said clone that they got with dubious heritage or whatever
they submit it to Phylos and by doing so say that phylo phylos verified their clone is legitimate
you know yeah yeah that happened that started happening a lot too and that was a real problem
because and as we learned allegedly shit yeah Phylos couldn't tell people any kind of plant
relation with any consistency I mean that maybe we should say this about CSI is that it doesn't
matter what it is but CSI sent in thought this is how Matt myself and CSI discovered that Phylos was
really really really full of it we had some evidence before but this was kind of one of the
big kickers was that CSI had made a cross and he sent in both parents and I don't know what's the
story out so much no yeah well I'll shut up about it then I didn't even mention what it was but I'll
just say this we discovered that their genetic sequencing wasn't as strong as we would have
hoped yeah yeah it was definitely disappointing with the consistency of it you know and so people
thought that their genetic testing was like American genetic testing yeah where you can have
23 and me or some shit and be like oh my god I'm 5% Norwegian and you know grandpa was from Germany
and this guy and I'm like and I'm part African or whatever yeah and we were hoping that same kind of
accuracy would be transferred into wheat yeah and I'm trying to move Caleb in oh we'll see Caleb
click the thing and save request to join if you can if you if you see how to do that hit the request
to join button so I can add you in when you got time all right go ahead yeah so I mean it it and
you know in order the other the other thing about it is is for like talking about human genetics is
geneticists can go to like a pure Norwegian or a pure Japanese or a pure Chinese or whatever and
they can start comparing DNA yeah and seeing these different things and they know how to
sequence it if it would be amazing if DNA evidence had existed in Holland in the 80s yeah and Neville
and an SSSC and and sensei in these early groups would have been able to like put down markers of
what was what yeah and then we could have seen their descendants because you'd have something
to compare it to yeah but that's not always case that's not always the case so really you know so
it remains a dream because here he is sir your lighting is terrible but if you just look like
you look like you're on 60 minutes and you're one of those like grayed out you know like guys
this protection program it's too bright in here it's too bright yeah well you can hear your voice
fine too bright yeah yeah I ain't trying to you know well you look beautiful oh thank you thank
you so maybe I talk a lot so maybe I'll do like an introduction not that one's needed and then
I'll shut up and get out of the way so part of the reason why we did we decided to do this selection
tonight was because it blends something that's currently going on with something that's extremely
famous and has a bunch of history to it so I just spent a whole bunch of time chatting about the
history of it and the simple and maybe like you know mellow way to talk about it is that in in
our search of history we started getting in contact with some of these original Northern
Lights crew people and hearing their story and as part of that we got we got some seats mm-hmm
Matt got some seats and then Matt and and Caleb here decided to collaborate on it and and Caleb
donated some space and some time and some energy and they did a bunch of stuff both growing out
looking within the line making hybrids and all that and so I was I was involved as much as
listening to them talk about it so I'll shut up and turn it over to them because they are about
to offer up some seeds of what they have going on and it might be you know some of the first real
NL to come on the market in a while so Matt and Caleb why don't you chat about what you found and
what you saw and what interested you and da da da da da well first things first you know I'm you
know when I posted up on IG you know there's there's a few people who are like you know what
did what did Matt have to do with any of this you know and I wouldn't even be growing these seeds if
Matt can you know had all that dialogue with you know mystery man and you know he's the one who
put all that together he's the one who sourced these seeds essentially so I wouldn't be growing
nothing without Matt you know making that first step so yeah maybe maybe I'll throw in one more
thing so everyone knows when you know breeders like us get together it's super common for some
breeding to be a collaborative process right right this guy's got some seeds you know they both have
an idea this other person has some room that they're willing to put towards the idea or a
greenhouse or some indoor space they come up with a plan and you breed together right and people
might not hear about JJ of the transaction but but every but everybody everybody you know lots
lots of friends who are breeders kind of collaborate on little things like that all the
time it's super common just so people just so people know so you know you know Matt had the
seeds you know CSI had the space and skill and you know and ability we all had the interest in
the history behind it and really wanted to see what was in there and so it you know the project
happened right and you know some people know some people don't that the very first you know
clone I ever grew came from my dad and that was Northern Lights back in 1994 you know so it's
about that one dude I mean you know I remember I mean I rocked it on and off until about 2002 when
I lost it and it was a cola plant super frosty a decent density you know not not like rock hard
Girl Scout cookies or anything I described the nose but I'm absolutely horrible at describing
you know the smells so when people ask I'm like it smells good I don't know that's not my forte I
I'm more of a visual you know oh it looks like this you know it's similar to this in the looks
apartment blah blah blah you know other than you know it smells great or whatever whatever I'm not
the dude for for the sniffer yeah yeah yeah I mean when you lost it was it something you kept
looking for like when you when you're picking up clones oh yeah oh yeah yeah no it was one of the
things that you know family and friends you know all had it and then you know I lost it and I went
looking and nobody had it everybody lost it you know that's how it goes yeah but people are asking
if it purpled no no no not not the one I got from my dad yes I don't I don't really recall it even
remotely having any type of purple to it at all yeah and and these these you know nl5 seeds that
you know I just ran there was very very little if any you know actual purple to any of them so yeah
you know but then again sometimes when you're making seed you know the purple traits kind of
tend to take a backseat yeah a lot of purple things will be halfway green you know or all
the way green you know when they're making seeds so I mean Mendo purple does that you know where
it's you know more green than purple even under cool temperatures and everything when it's full
of seeds yeah you know so but I think the plants have different processes when they're pregnant
versus not right right you know they do they do very different things their their goal is different
at the time and and I didn't even think about this but I'm I'm feeding seeded out plants you
know nitrogen fuck all the way through yeah I'm not trying to cut off their nitro source you know
early like it would a flower so yeah the goal is is healthy mature seeds not attractive flower mm-hmm
exactly flower is just the carrier for the seed so it's very different it's a very different
feeding regimen to get where you want to go yeah and flower which is why when you have a failed run
and a bunch of flower and no seed smoke ain't the best maybe maybe I should mention something is
that you know CSI has actual as you know he has some pictures of some of these old gardens and
stuff like that but unfortunately since it was all prohibition II back then they were on Polaroids
and you learn with Polaroids that they fade over time mm-hmm you know so they become the the colors
start to become washed out the edges start to become less distinct yeah so you know he cataloged
some of it and you know you can you can get a general idea but it's not the sharpest of picks
right I have thousands of these Polaroids you know for you know the better part of a decade
and now now they're not much to look at yeah that's a bummer dude that's such a bubble right
right it's just something you didn't know at the time mm-hmm who knew that over 15 20 25 years
Polaroids would would fade right a regular picture developed at a you know you know old
school style will stay good for a long time right Polaroids don't you know I should have and them
all while I had the chance yeah I mean you know we all should have done things differently when
we were younger yeah you know that's the common theme right your camera slowly but surely burning
out bro well you know so the best thing is is I was having I was having a conversation with with
our buddy Pip who is gonna drop some seeds soon and he might come on here and chat with Matt and
I but he didn't really want to show his face so I'm definitely gonna show him this CSI tech yeah
right here real because it's exactly what he's looking for this embodied voice coming out of
the darkness isn't that how they always used to do this is Barry 60 minutes in the 90s you know
I just need the voice tech yeah that voice tech yeah yeah tell us what you saw man tell it tell
us what you saw in that room okay so the the seeds that right and I have available are basically an
open pollination from 47 plants 27 females 20 males just open pollinated and you know there
was there was definitely good bad and the ugly in there there was one plant that was near identical
to the norm light I grew you know from 94 on from my dad smelled like it looked extremely similar to
it you know all of that and you know I had one of my good old old buddies from you know from that
area you know you know check checking things out with me as it was progressing and he was like
yeah that's that's just like the plant we we used to rock you know 25 years ago so that's wild that
that's definitely a good sign there was a lot of variety in there one of my favorites of course was
this one that was super frosty kind of a popcorn nugget thing really good stretch and it was kind
of bubblegum II that's how I you know describe it but I don't know maybe other people would you know
just describe the smell different but it was really nice and we're definitely saving that one and then
there one that was I just have it written down as stinky as fuck but it's it had like 10 different
smells you know top middle bottom and I can't describe that kind of stuff but you know there's
there's guys with noses who are like oh yeah that's blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you
know and list 20 different smells on something but all I know is it smelled amazing too yeah and
that one that one's definitely a keeper and then there were some other ones that you know ranged
you know this way and that way and you know might might end up being keepers might not definitely
gonna give them a couple few runs to decide on which ones are gonna kind of make the cut for
future projects you know so that's what I'm stoked about is that we get to see them as clones not just
seed seed moms you know but as clones and clones of everything it's it's pretty expensive and it
was a it was a cool it was cool that and I know you know he he credits me with getting the seeds
and stuff but it was it was really cool to be able to look inside CSI's mindset as he did these
selections what he was looking for how he went about it how many clones he was keeping of each
I learned a lot I learned a lot from dude during this so he put in the work no matter what he says
he put in the fucking work on this stuff so right yeah maybe and maybe I should add something in
where Caleb and I chat a bunch about like you know phenos he's found in seed lines before that
didn't survive like you know the backup clone didn't survive and he lost it and he's like well
you know I got X amount of these seeds I can find it again so maybe you know how excited were
you dude to find something that was pretty close to the spitting image of your lost plant I was
stoked on it but you know I was honestly more excited with some of these other ones that you
know because you know back in 94 you're the the reality is you know it's just a traded clone you
have no idea you know where it came from how many speeds it got selected from you know anything about
it you know and that's the thing with traded clones is you know it might be selected from one
or four and or a hundred you know I just like you know having the opportunity to actually select
from better than one yeah for sure I think too that like there are things for all of us now that
we're all older where some of the strains that you grow first and you build your first relationships
with as a grower right in your mind because you're learning so much then and this is your kind bud
plant right right you know and they really stick with you those and you know you think back like
oh what could I have done with that plant when I actually had some some knowledge when I had that
plant I was an idiot you know I was 19 or something and I didn't know Jack and now I'm like you know
what could I do if I had it now right right yeah yeah yeah I'm a little interested too and I know
this is an NL talk but are you do you want to talk about any of the pinks and purps stuff you're
into since that's a big project you have going on right now oh we could touch on it just a little
bit yeah yeah you know had me amped yeah I'm definitely gonna you know try to post up a little
bit more on that soon just because there's there's some interesting stuff in in there and uh yeah
that one keeper I was telling you about it smells better than 99% of weed I've come across so that's
wild you know definitely it's not a purple pheno pure green you know no purple traits to it
whatsoever but man the smell is just so overpowering I think it could be a pass-around
keeper as long as it's over 5% THC of course yeah we should mention that some of the terpious
things tend to be lower THC right right there's a ratio there's a there's a there's a ratio there
that's not fully understood but a lot of times things that are extremely human perception
terpy mm-hmm don't tend to be the most potent there are things out there that have both but a
lot of them don't so we'll see and have I told you much or anything about this uh this pinks and
purps plant I I heard it through your com you and Matt chatted about it and he called me all excited
yeah because it's rare that you sound that excited yeah something that you found so he was I've never
hear him overstate anything about anything dude pops thousands of seeds so when he tells me dude
like this is special like oh yeah I mean I think I think homie told me something like he thinks it
might be like the best vino he's found yeah which for some for someone like you to say who pops
literally like thousands of seeds over a number of years and searches through them that's really
something oh yeah you know and it really is I like to give to give credit to you know what what
plants you know kind of produce these kind of things yeah this particular plant you know it has
Mendo purple in its background but there's no purple traits to this plant at all but Mendo purple
has this strong mango trait that pops up in the ones and this thing is that mango times a hundred
you know it's it's just the strongest mango I've ever smelled Wow you know as you know and a bunch
more fruit too but uh you know I know it gets that mango you know at least you know a portion of it
from from the Mendo purps so you know could be cool as long as I don't lose the clone ganja boners
yeah I mean one one of the things that the Mendo piece certainly has is it's got pretty wide genetic
diversity so there's a lot of turps in there right you know and so then you throw it on something else
that's also terpy and maybe wide you can get these unusual things that have a potential to pop up
right I mean that's kind of like people should know this too and maybe I should say it right now
where it's like if you cross something to like that you know to buck to I don't know to deep
chunk you're gonna get a lot of deep chunk and it's gonna be really consistent you know and
there's certain things you throw certain things on cookies and it looks very cookie right and so
people get frustrated when you cross two very wide things because you can get a bunch of junk and you
can get a bunch of this and that and it's all like unpredictable oh yeah but then every once in a
while amongst all that stuff there's this gem because it's so wide and unpredictable and you're
like oh whoa what is that thing right right sometimes the frustration and the effort pays
off because a really wide base of things to look through and maybe I should say this too is when
you know when Caleb was referencing when he did the open pollination that there was some gems some
some junk that's 90s weed if you have a wide genetic base you're gonna get amazing mid Z junk
they're all in combo and also on that pinks and perps one you know I always I was I always forget
this but I grew out when I made those and found that one I was growing out a hundred and eighty
of those things so there was only one like it out of a hundred and eight yeah you know so what
how it's gonna breed because it was such an outlier right oh were there other other phenos
that were more consistent and like pop it up more often oh yeah the the the purple ones were
predominant yeah to find an actual green one in in this hybrid was actually the rarity you know
most most everything was you know some form of light pink or lavender you know all the way through
you know purple to almost black yeah you know but uh yeah the green ones were were rare you know and
and I probably kept out of the hundred eighty I probably kept about 20 or so of the of the darker
purple ones and just the real terpere ones the you know but they're all I don't think I I have
any other green ones out of the whole all all the purples and the blacks that's a while now yeah
that it was so consistently that and then this one pops up right so and so maybe I should throw this
out there just real quick before we totally lose the thread on it is on some of these ones that
you found that that the one that's super frosty and smells to you like bubblegum and the one that
kind of reminds you strongly of your dad dad's dad's NL and such you're probably planning on
doing some more breeding with those select females correct oh yeah I'm already working on that too
so the first round of course was the open pollination and now I have a room that's a
couple few weeks into flower and that's all the keeper females and my keeper male my favorite
male out of the whole bunch which is I don't know it's like almost a milk chocolatey smelling male
and he's super pungent and he almost looks like a bigger version of purple indica you know that's
that's a throwback from the same you know Washington areas these seeds came from you know so you know
there's something to that and like I've told told Matt I'm not sure if I told you not so but
uh when the norm lights I used to have you know occasionally I'd throw a late nanner or whatever
whatever and I grew out a bunch of s1 seeds well I gave you know some of these s1s to my buddy you
know clones of the s1s anyway and he accidentally crossed it to train wreck and when that stuff was
grown out it had that same chocolatiness that I'm smelling in this thing you know when grown
outdoors so I don't know if it's just coincidence or or what but you know it could just be same
similar genetics the power of accidents the power of accidents so maybe I should throw this in there
too so if with with the seeds that Matt and Caleb are offering up this open pollination what that's
gonna give you is you know that's gonna give you your own ability to hunt through the line and it's
going to be very wide you know but you could find gems just like he found you know you could you
could absolutely perhaps find what you wouldn't know that look you know there could be bubblegum
smelling ones there could be this ones there could be there's a reasonably good chance that somewhere
in there is those phenos pop up again and then give them X amount of months to do some more
breeding and we'll get a chance to see if some of these selected females breed true for the traits
that he liked because those will be on offer too so that's kind of like for people that don't know
that's kind of like when you get old seeds or seeds that you want to preserve one of the best
things to do to keep the genetic diversity of the line is just to open pollinate everything right and
then you know you can set aside you know some seeds from selected phenos and you can keep certain
phenos and start breeding with them and intentionally and seeing where it takes you so
that's kind of like that's one of the processes of taking old seeds and trying to both preserve
the line but then take it in certain directions mm-hmm yep yep I was that's kind of how I and
you've done that a number of times with like various heirloom strains that you've come across
you know always open pollinate step one and then you know you can do whatever you want past that
directional this way that way or the other you know and everybody else can too as long as you
know you share the seed and all that you know yeah mm-hmm are there any other projects you're super
stoked about past that like any fem projects coming up that you're pumped about who I got
that patient zero common patient zero is on its way I don't know that that one's gonna be interesting
I'm not sure how that one's gonna turn out but you know we'll see it could be cool maybe you
could explain for people because you have so many names because you're so prolific about things what
is patient zero no patient zero is a you know basically it's the just the urkel across the
Pakistani Chitral Kush and I grew out a hundred and something of those years ago and my absolute
favorite plan of that one was a was the one I named patient zero and you know it's it's kind of
as long as you like a little terpenelein on your diet it's pretty alright and so maybe I'll add
that to it too where it's like a lot of modern breeding today is one-offs where people hybridize
something and then just toss it out to the public what he just described is what's known as like
multi-stage breeding where he made a cross he grew out a bunch of phenos he picked one that he
liked and now he's doing further work with that pheno itself probably crossing it to itself and
crossing it to other cuttings that he has in the stable that he thinks might blend well right what
one of my favorites I actually have flowering right now is the Mendo purple number 54 selection
from you know growing out that last hundred and something of those mm-hmm the urkel 103 you know
s1 and then you know those you know I reversed the 103 slapped it on the Mendo man those are uniform
I mean as uniform as you can get really yeah that's cool interestingly the Mendo is extremely
dominant on it really yeah they're all they look more like Mendo purple plants then you can barely
see any urkel to them and the both of those selections were made out of that room that I
came and visited you and saw before you the s1s of urkel and the s1s of Mendo P yeah yeah yeah
yep mm-hmm but uh yeah yeah definitely interesting though I don't know yeah I was excited to like
about I don't know if you want to talk about any of the purple punch stuff or if that's you know
what I mean like the the findings in that you're kind of saying that are unique yeah yeah um the
we've talked and the most surprising thing about breeding with purple punch is how fucking stable
it is I mean actually right when you're working with you know it doesn't matter what you know
OG's diesels chem dogs or scouts you know and then all the popular stuff based off all those
yeah you're gonna find a nice portion of you know hermaphrodism you know more so if you know
your environments not a you know perfect but you know even if you have a perfect environment
there's always gonna be a percentage of those but the purple punches have almost the lowest
levels of hermaphrodism I've seen in any hybrids so I mean that's that's useful that's something
people look for and I think like the fact that it popped up in an OG GDP was kind of shocking
you know yeah yeah and you know I was I was the I wasn't a huge fan of purple punch I didn't even
you know start growing it until a couple years ago yeah I kind of ignored it and was like I got
plenty of my own urkel hybrids I don't need another one yeah you know it has traits that it
puts forward and you really can't argue with it you know yeah I was the same way you know we both
just kind of dodged hype for a while with like the fucking the the gorilla glue and that and then end
up at the end that shit's kind of good there right last one to the party that's an interesting that's
an interesting aspect that people maybe should hear about is sometimes you can have an amazing
cut that checks a bunch of boxes and it reads like shit right it's right all over the place
that throws a bunch of junk and it does the quality inherent in the cut itself doesn't seem
to translate to its children very well and then other times you can take something like purple
punch that they're just talking about that has a lot of nice traits but kind of lacks high or
whatever else and you don't think that much of it and then you cross it to things and its children
come out incredibly amazing with a bunch of traits that you like right so sometimes a breeding parent
can actually be kind of a crappy crappy plant in some ways like Caleb likes a lot of the s1's of
my Mendo P quite a bit more than the mama mm-hmm oh yeah you know the mama is amazing for breeding
but as an actual plant itself there's some aspects to it that are unpredictable and and
it's low THC right right but some of its children and some of the things that it throws and when you
breed and sometimes you might take something like purple punch that people make fun of and you breed
with it and you're like wow this thing is amazing mm-hmm it throws all these traits consistently
right I mean like you could talk for a minute about how stable that bubblegum cut you have
it's mm-hmm why you use it in so many different things because it throws like rock you know it
doesn't rot very easily it's got incredible structure it densens things up right right
well I don't know about it's really not the densest cut out there but it's it's it's definitely
you know as as rot resistant as you can you can get a plant you know on my worst year you're ever
outdoors I think I was aiming for like 700 pounds or something and then we had six inches of rain
the last week of September you know first week of October and I lost 50 to 60 percent of that
garden to mold and the only thing that came through that garden with probably less than 1%
rot ratio was that bubblegum cut and winning you know so you know tons of people are like you know
what's your best you know mold resistant you know blah blah blah well right there you know so
that outdoor Queen yeah so someone sometimes those traits like they were just talking about like you
know Caleb does an enormous amount of breeding so for him to say that the purple punch is some of
the most non intersex stable thing he's ever worked with is saying something you know when he says that
like this plant is almost immune to mold and it's the most mold resistant plant I've ever seen and
it passes that trait to some progeny that's useful information right I see a lot of people commenting
on the purple punch straight and like when breeding has changed from where it was maybe 10 years ago
on what we would select for potency wise what we wouldn't use what we would use certain one of us
you know purple punch all I'd ever heard about was how weak it was so I just never I never got
into it however it is it is a very extract centric community now and with extracts pretty much
everything's fucking strong so so a lot of things are more turk based now where people are checking
out what kind of turps are being passed how they breed and yeah I mean some people won't want to
won't want to fuck with anything that doesn't lay them out me I like all kinds of ranges of different
highs and I don't like being laid out so for me purple punch is fucking perfect yeah yeah you know
weed weed affects humans in different ways some of my favorite strains to smoke on a regular basis
the other two guys that were checked you know they don't like it that much on a big they agree
it's it's a super quality cut but it's not something with their body chemistry that really
adapts all that well yeah I have friends that only like incredibly potent indica's because they want
to be hammered down and a sativa makes them crawl up the wall yeah I have other friends that smoke a
sativa and they relax right that would be me so yeah so cannabis and cannabis and individual
strains don't think that the way it affects you is the way it affects everyone there's a range there
yeah yeah that's why I like keeping so many different you know cultivars because you know I
like a whole spectrum of different things and I know other people too you know like different things
so you can't always breed for yourself you know definitely not does the purple punch reverse yeah
yeah it refers is fine interesting so it reverses easily but won't ever throw intersex traits yeah
yeah that's kind of odd in itself right the asshole I got grown now I don't think I found a single
ball or or nanner on any of them yeah which is almost unheard of oh yeah yeah yeah you're usually
gonna get at least 10 to 20% you know and I I say 10 to 20% and that could just be one ball down low
or one you know late nanner or something but there's always going to be like 10 to 20% yeah
mm-hmm and then there's certain things that perm boom reverse right right you know I mean we've
talked before about we're not going to get into it too much but you know they you know the old
sour cuts are famous for not reversing oh yeah we're getting a handful of seed but they're also
famous for the wrong conditions and they they throw nanners that's can see I create seed in your room
for flower production yeah it's really easy to grow it boofy I had a I had some sour some sour
D's in a in a fully seeded out room just recently and you know completely full of seed and about
week four it just starts balling up just hanging all kinds of sour diesel balls even though it's
fully seeded so there the whole room was completely seeded so it didn't have any risk of pollinating
anything but you know it still felt the need to you know throw out just a ton of balls like what
are you doing with this you know I didn't see any pollen off of them but you know yeah yeah I mean
the you know the the what I consider to be the original but you know it's the one I got the
chem D cut is pretty famous for throwing a bunch of nanners at week three four but they're sterile
you know they don't really they don't really you know they don't they don't really make seed yeah
and that chem D or just chem DS in general it seems yeah they throw bananas like they're going
out of style yeah it's a trait that goes there and so I've had any number of friends or helpers
or whatever on a light depth greenhouse come to me panicked because half the greenhouse has
bananas popping out all over right I'm like oh calm down calm down it's it's the D we're gonna
be fine you know and we're fine you know you can find a bean yeah but you know you do that
with cherry pie or something and you have beans everywhere so certain things certain things are
different different risky you know there's different levels of risk yeah yeah yeah where
so I mean maybe we should maybe we should chat about this maybe we should reel it back in for
a second part of the reason why we did this nl5 chat both starting in the 80s and going through
some of the history and then bringing Caleb on was to talk about the project that that him and
Matt have going and they just dropped the seeds I believe yes or we're about to or just did another
dropped the Caleb's Caleb site is humble CSI calm correct Caleb yeah that you could buy them on
there or I'll write seed code calm yeah and so it's a it's a riot and and Caleb collab and it's
a big open pollination of genetics from one of the people that was intimately involved in the old
NL crew so the provenance is excellent as far as like who it comes from and you know but then on
of that to the proof is in the pudding so you know it it's a chance for people to maybe hunt
around if you have if you're a little adventurous and look through something old and something
famous you know and you know Caleb found a few things in it that he was super excited about and
so hopefully you you guys will too and one of the ways that we're gonna make sure that not everything
is skittles og cookie Cushman's whatever is by people taking effort and reviving some of these
old things and making fresh bats of batches of seed that are more viable and then getting them
into people's hands so the gene pool stays wider yeah yeah so not only is it a cool old project to
something that's extremely famous and there's potential in it but you can better believe that
most modern breeding with a few exceptions is the same 30 or 40 cuts blended in a bunch of
different ways over the last 10 years and this harkens back to a much older time so there's a
possibility there that when you outcross things to something that aren't like each other if you
take these nl5 and you start throwing it on different stuff you have you might get some
unusual stuff you're not expecting that's good right you know Britain's fucking with me sorry
no it's like because that's because that's the thing is a lot of breeders say that like sometimes
you know crossing two very distinct things together is where you really get quality pop yeah you know
and you're certainly introducing something older in the gene pool that was very common 20-30 years
ago but now is many generations in her bread and so by these guys doing this project work it's kind
of getting thrown out there again where it can get bred into a lot of modern stuff and people get
to see what happens so you know you'll get more opportunities to see what CSI is doing with the
work in future breeding projects that seem like they're already engaged and hopefully people are
gonna buy a bunch of this stuff and start posting and trying them out themselves mm-hmm and it's
one of the ways you can keep cannabis history alive right and making the urge with the stuff
yeah yeah you know mixing it with modern things and seeing what happens right right so what do
you guys think would be the best you know available plant line whatever out there to
cross to the nl5s you know I personally I want to see the hogs breath in all five I think that
would be cool if we could track that down and do that again it's been out of my hands for a while
but I think that would be interesting just because the terms mm-hmm how about you not so you know I
actually think that it might cross well with something like the dog shit mm-hmm okay okay
you know kind of a potentially almost a back cross potentially almost I mean a back cross has to use
technically the same cut to go back to but maybe something that is very NL because one thing I'll
say about that dog shit grown indoor is boy does it look like 90s weed yeah lime green with bright
orange hairs and it just has that like NL type of like like look I was gonna say hydro but Caleb is
purely organic so I don't want to insult them it's just that like that like big sack of hydro
NL that you would get you know that's just super frosty and stuff like that and so you know but it
might give it some stretch and some vigor and it might kind of like and that's kind of like what I
like one of the things that I get interested about is crossing two different things that you think
have similar parentage behind them and then you see if you get some throwbacks because both parents
have it yeah I do have the dog shit in my latest round so you know but it's getting across to that
that chocolatey mm-hmm NL five male and honestly I think there were better there are males that
kind of looked more similar to dog shit but I you know I didn't use them personally for this
round because I liked that you know particular you know chocolatey one and if I was gonna throw
out one more recommendation and combine the old with the new one of Neville's most classic
combinations was nl5 and skunk and I kind of view the diesel family as sir what we have is
surviving modern skunk not that there's not cheese and a couple other things like that but I kind of
view like Sowers as American skunk right or very very skunkish so it would be kind of cool to see
like what we have now is skunk and what we have now is NL blended back together right because that
was one of the most classic best-selling and they combined super well mm-hmm yeah I definitely have
cheese in there too so you know you know at least one are you talking skunk one or skunk I mean I
cheese is fine that's obviously pure skunk one that's really old I was just thinking of certain
diesels just because I consider I consider certain diesels modern that to me that even though it
doesn't have the name I consider a diesel to be like a skunk skunk skunkoid type plant right right
it's tall it's rangy you know it's it's got that kind of skunk type growth to it it's got these
I basically think of like gas and diesel as it's not like roadkill but it is on that skunk spectrum
mm-hmm it's like different angles of the same turps yeah you know yeah it's kind of how I see
it so you know but yeah and then the other thing too is that you know you know you cross it to
things you hope are gonna cross well and then you cross it to some things that are just random and
sometimes those random ones end up being the best ones because you really don't know and you
really don't know what genes are gonna pop right right and you really don't know what recessives
are in there true true right like so to take it back to humans unless both parents have the gene
you can't have kids with blue eyes or green eyes mm-hmm you know you if if one parent has the
recessive the other parent has the dominant it won't combine right blonde hair is the same way
both parents have to have the blonde hair gene or the red hair gene or it won't pop and so
sometimes if you take two things that you think might have similar genes you might get some
recessives that pop and all of a sudden something unusual comes out you know yeah yeah so yeah well
I promise to not hold Caleb too long I know he's got some shit to do tonight too so I'm thankful
for you coming and talking about the Northern Lights I know everybody's super stoked to be
able to hear about it firsthand but yeah is there anything else you want to talk about before we all
bounce I think I'm good I gotta go wrangle a five-year-old beast please yeah no yeah no Friday
night isn't the easiest night for you so we super appreciate you coming on and shooting the shit and
all that you know and you know I briefly saw your face in the shadows there for a minute before the
black kicked in but yeah you know that's that's kind of it we wanted to chat about you know we
wanted to chat about the history we wanted to clear up some misconceptions and we wanted people
to hear about some of the specifics of what was available how it was made what you what we saw in
it and let people go from there so as always everyone thank you for giving us part of your
Friday night you know where do you where can people find your seats again humble CSI calm
there you go yeah humble CSI calm will grab the nl5 please hey don't experience it make sure you
let them know about yours too yeah I got it too but but you know support the man yeah so you know
both guys have it you can get them both off each of their individual websites they were
communicating a bunch during the during the grow they were talking about what he was seeing sharing
pictures and just you know it and all that and so you know it's how a lot of it's all a lot of
passion projects get made today is with people that have similar interests collaborating and
so support it if you can if you you know it'd be great and it would spread out some old genetics
and it would keep them alive and you could do your little part to make sure that the gene pool stays
wider and hopefully find some fire yeah no you know everybody enjoy their Friday night as always
there's a million questions we didn't get to but you can always hit us up on our discord
Matt and I chat up there a whole bunch we're pretty responsive to questions and all that and
so you know every every Friday night we'll try to bring you something new and pertinent and
interesting and bring on various friends we have and all that and kind of just push the history and
the info forward and at the very least you get to see not so naked all right thanks everyone enjoy
you have a great night good night cheers
