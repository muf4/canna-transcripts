what's up everyone finally got somewhat of a backdrop behind me finally I want
to show it off because I didn't put so much time into making it pretty but yeah
anyways waiting for not so and then we'll kick it off
shoutouts to the syndicate crew shoutouts to everyone fucking in the
patreon and our patreon discord everybody fucking interacting over there
it's been fucking awesome it's been really awesome lately a lot of
supportive people if I have sight issues fucking people fucking hit me up and
help like it's been crazy it's been really cool so I appreciate all you guys
that are that are hanging out and shooting the shit with us and learning
with us as as we do a lot of this deep diving and get ready for the shows and
picking show titles and and shit to talk about one thing I do ask is that
people share the podcast we need people to share them so much right now because
of starting from scratch so definitely need people to do that so the more you
share it the more reviews you leave the likes on YouTube all that shit it helps
it really does it really it helps it build traction and get seen and
recommended to other people if a lot of people are liking it and leaving reviews
and all that bullshit I fucked up though cuz you're not supposed to cuss within
the first 35 seconds yeah I need to um I have SSL on the site but it's not
hooked up correctly so I need I need someone who's good at domains to set that
up but I have my old web check looking at it right now or going to this weekend
so that's rad the person that I was with and worked with for a long time on web
stuff I just went back to that here we go mr. goat farm yeah everybody check out
Santa Cruz I don't know why it's not letting me add not so yet see there we
go Santa Cruz goat farm on riot seats calm go check it out we have all the
stuff up tons of pictures all that good stuff I exist there you are indeed all
right so how's your how's your start of your week weekend it's going good good
so far yeah it's going good good deal like fairs in town so my kids are all
excited are they there right now yeah they go
they saw them some of them yeah yes this is these are my care bears behind
me of course you like the backdrop it's better than the prison wall it is better
than the prison wall it's a lot you know it just shows what you can spend on
yourself when you don't have children yeah you could buy yourself all kinds of
figurines yeah someone asked about resin lung I have no clue I texted him two
days ago no response yet he likes to go away and disappear for a long period of
time randomly one of the weirdest dudes I've ever met he does he does like to
you know I'm great hibernate not not everyone has the easiest time with
socialization and all that you know yeah and in fact I will say too that like a
lot of breeders and growers and all that kind of stuff like it you know at some
times like you have to be somewhat used to isolation yeah you know you spend a
lot of time kind of alone yeah you know I mean yeah it's I miss him dude he's so
funny I know we all miss him but yeah hopefully he'll come back sometime yeah
it would be good I mean but that a lot of times that's weed people yeah you
know they flow in and out you know sometimes you only have so much energy
for socialization yeah you know the desire to be public you know yeah
somebody said pandemic same thing for me pandemic was easy I'll spend a lot of
time alone and you know yeah I can yeah I was super easy for me but for a lot of
people that are super social you know I mean there's a lot of people that can't
even be quiet yeah you know they get they have to have music on or they have
to have someone talking because it's like they're just not used to yeah so
yeah looks like someone accidentally got blocked sorry sorry whoever it was
I can't unblock you I'd have to stop the show to do it so yeah yeah Matt on that
not only does he have a quick block finger he has a fat accidental block
thumb I do I do and the problem is like when people say shit in here that I want
to get rid of I go to click it and I'll go to get boot but sometimes it'll scroll
up when I go to do it and I do it so fast that it's just like boom and then I
told I'm like well I'm trying to remember stuff and answer but and then
I'm like I don't even remember who I did it to but before before like we jump
into like what the show is actually about what you know maybe I'll add one
comment onto that which is that the whole thing about like I see a lot of
people commenting on like how they kind of liked the Kovat lockdowns because it
fit their lifestyle you know or like they're prepared for it you know there's
a lot of us who are kind of involved in for a long time that like the way you
stayed safe was like you had a tight group of friends that knew you're up to
and you stayed quiet and you kept your head down and you tried to be invisible
yeah and I actually do think that played a massive and you know and then there's
a whole thing of like some people like the plants more than people you know and
people had weird quirks and you know one of the things that cannabis allowed was
like your weird quirks to get bigger yeah because you could self-sustain
whether it was seeds or flower or hustling or whatever it might be you
know and a lot of times like you know real jobs and stuff they sand those
edges yeah you know and so we get a lot of quirky people in weed and then when
the money came into weed right so here's the here's the point I wanted to make
when the money came into weed the vast majority of the like slightly invisible
suspicious weed people sort of hid and took like a waiting wait and see kind of
attitude towards what was going on yeah right which meant like all the super
social hustler bullshitty type people they all ran to the capital first
because that's what they wanted was money yeah money and rap and all this
different stuff and said all of a sudden there was like minor weed celebrities
and you know and this and that and everything else and so as a result like
a lot all the people that all the money partnered with first weren't like the
deep breeders and the people pulling off real shit and the and the people that
grew exceptional flower and all that it was like all the people that were like
you know that they were socially you know they just ran towards it they're
from cities they were connected they have rich parents or rich brother or you
know some kind of media whatever and so it's kind of been fucked up and that
like a lot of the like the faces of cannabis like they're not the heart of
the scene no I mean that's that's a given like a lot of these corporate guys
where they made the mistake and investors they made the mistake in
thinking that they could walk into a black market and talk to it talk to the
deepest dudes in the deepest circles because obviously those are the guys on
high times covers and winning cups obviously those are the guys that are
the deep ones in the deep circles I mean you know they kind of they kind of
screwed each other and in the process they lit a bunch of money on fire
because a lot of the capital like sharky rich people like you know partnering
with some of some terrible people in the industry each party was trying to screw
the other yeah like the weed hustlers were trying to get a bunch of money from
the rich people and the rich people were trying to like steal genetics and SOP
and then kick the fucking hustlers out yeah only like the hustlers couldn't do
what they they couldn't they couldn't set up actual large scenes and run them
efficiently they had no heart for a long time they didn't understand all
that different stuff and so they sort of learned on the rich people's dime yeah
you know what honestly like if someone would it came to me and said hey you
know what I know you've been doing this X amount of time I want you to scale up
and I want you to run this fucking massive facility I wouldn't have been
able to do it like I mean scaling up is a hard fucking thing it takes a certain
kind of brain to go from being able to blow up houses to blowing up fucking
major facilities it is not easy it's not the same thing at all it's not it's
not necessarily I mean the one thing that does translate is that if you're a
good pot grower and you're observant of the plant that helps because that helps
you fine-tune whatever the fuck is going on with your greenhouse or your outdoor
your room or wherever you might be growing weed you know but certainly
scale and you know and then the other part of it too is like like everybody
agrees that there's craft weed but nobody agrees where a craft stops yeah
you know like so so that way everybody gets the clean craft yeah you know you
have people with a hundred lighter claiming craft you have people with
acres claiming craft you have people with a ten thousand squids you know it's
all they're all growing the fire yep yeah I was I was watching a video
earlier today and I mentioned it to you it was people growing aquaponics on a
large scale for a major retailer in Canada and they were just they were
growing games in aquaponics it was one of the first times I've ever seen that
so yeah actually my all that 20 years ago and it's it's because it's actually
like it fit what I was it's hydro but with fish yeah kind of but it's organic
but you know so it's like if you get it right it's pretty neat you know it's
very hard to find really quality like exceptional quality cannabis grown
aquaponics because it's so hard with the inputs you get the fish what you want
them to output you know what I mean like it's hard to get quality quality and
yeah I mean it was it was just never the most efficient thing for almost anyone
no matter who you were yeah as a result it wasn't it what you know it's not like
you had a thriving fish business that you sold tilapia and yeah sold cannabis
like it just didn't really mix yeah but it's a cool like closed-loop method in
a way yeah you know that's for sure I admire it it's hard it's hard stuff you
have to be fastidious and very attention detail-oriented or you know I mean I'll
say something to like about craft like even say 20 years ago or 25 years ago
like in the when a lot of people were growing like generator scenes in the
woods around here right yeah most of the people that work there that were
growing at a hundred or two hundred lighters almost all of them bought their
head stash from people that had four to ten lights yeah yeah yeah because it was
just nicer yeah I mean even ten thousand square feet is kind of a lot of weed
yeah you know so like where is where is craft where is the amount where and not
just like growing it but like growing it and handling it and drying it and
curing it all the right way because you can fuck up at any of those steps yep
and then it's not as good so it's not just about like growing it it's like all
the way to the end can you manage that whole thing yeah at scale you know so I
don't know I'm not just it's interesting on that regard where where is craft you
know where's crap what's a craft size indoor what's a craft size greenhouse
what's a craft size outdoor that'd be a curious thing to pose to the community
is someone just typed in there do you know Ken blah blah blah isn't that
Kendo I don't know blah blah I don't know yeah I'm pretty sure that's Kendo
he's talking about I know there's a bunch of Kens but Kendo you know Kendo
right I don't know if I know Kendo yeah Kendo is funny he's like the older me
just talks mad shit to Eric except he's tough a tough version of me yeah you
know yeah that's what's cool that anyway just to close on that that's what's cool
about craft is that everybody agrees that there is fire and craft and really
really excellent weed just no one agrees what that exactly is yeah so it allows
everyone to fight over it and claim it sure and now there's huge ass scenes
growing straight mids claiming craft because it's just marketing yeah it
means it's losing its its value in name like calling something crap is gonna
lose its value like calling something gank you know or kind it happens in any
kind of thing it's like people want to attach their not quality on to quality
yeah is really what it comes down to yeah so we're gonna have we're gonna
have some guests coming up but it didn't pop for this week so we're gonna do a
part two of clone list where Matt you know we go we're gonna go back and maybe
I'll give a little bit background real quick again here so we're mostly talking
about 90s to say like 2005 to 2010 clones yeah right and the reason for
that is that sort of before then like there was this immense amount of
diversity because weed was rare enough in most places that anybody that grew
quote-unquote kind bud it all sold yeah and it was easy to sell which allowed
people to pop seeds get stuff from seed banks trade with their local friends and
keep this random ass shit that worked well for them yeah right and what
happened is you know with the purple wave and then the sour wave and the
kush wave and then the Skittles and cookies and all that is that every huge
wave came along and instead of a whole bunch of different people growing all
these things lots of people started growing similar families of stuff yeah
because that's what sold well and a lot of those other things sort of went by
the wayside so there's this enormous amount of cuttings from like I don't
want to say Matt and I's childhood but like you know a younger time a younger
time in cannabis or whatever that like a lot of which have fallen by the wayside
and some of which are still around but a lot of which were super famous at the
time because it hadn't had to be so monocrop yep right and so when I did
when monocrop didn't happen before monocrop became a thing this is what we
all grew yeah so that this is part two of that what we grew before monocropping
yeah pretty much is pretty much it right so that the cannabis a clone list only
covered so many you know like it was pretty comprehensive but it wasn't all
encompassing there was a lot that was not on there so I added a bunch I also I
don't know if I know not so you hadn't seen these before or didn't have them or
whatever these are the old strain books from Green Candy Press my dad my buddy
Jack released these a while ago and it has it's pretty much that era of 2006 to
2012 breeders seed makers of all sorts there's bullshit in here there's
excellent shit in here there's everything in between good info bad info
but it's a good resource for knowing what was being at least being talked
about and grown around these times yeah they did the cannabis indica volume one
through three and then they did the the cannabis sativa volume one through three
and these are on Amazon still so grab them while they're still around it's a
great question for coming hard and fast so I'll throw something out there real
quick I'll enter sure people are talking a ton about the white family and white
widow yeah and we've mentioned this but you know when the white family hit in
the mid 90s it was like a tidal wave in cannabis it became the biggest one of
the biggest most popular cuts and lines in weed for about five to eight years
perhaps yeah and so as a result it got crossed with almost everything else good
right and it is there everything white is in this era that we're talking about
all the great white shark and white widow and white Rhino and blue widow and
all the numerous things because that was one of the first strains that like lots
of people got and then we're like I'm gonna cross it to everything cool I have
yeah so white Russian you know there's a bunch of the white family it was like an
OG kush of its day yeah where people got it and it was like the thing you
know yes so that's it's definitely and it still percolates around here and
there it's probably in more things than people realize yeah because the names
just got changed you know so but we're gonna kind of do this thing with uh with
Matt where he's got a big fucking list and we're gonna rapid-fire off some
stuff and do some off-the-head what we think about it what we remember
experiences and so forth okay he's got the list so I don't know what's coming
but we'll see yeah one second I was gonna invite archive on but he's hitting
the airplane um yeah so some of these on this list some of them like I may have
no knowledge about it and not so my not either but I put it on because it was
something going around at the time so at least we can kind of acknowledge it I
mean there's there's so many that didn't end up on this list that I mean there
might be a part 3 part 4 part 30 but it can grow yeah it's just the framework to
riff off of for the most part about history and strains of old and their
impact so I also didn't choose specific seed lines unless they had a clone in it
that was well known so there's a lot of seed lines in here like white rhino
where like in the US I don't remember a specific white rhino clone going around
there wasn't there wasn't any elite that like at least that made it onto the
national like forum and like traded scene yeah okay so last week we left off
with Matt Nisket Valley Thunder Fox yeah and we did indeed and right after that
comes og kush kush so one of the things I was thinking when covering og kush we
could just do a quick rundown of some of the og clones that were some of the
more early clones that were named okay fire them off so as far as I know I'll
start with four and Matt can riff off that if he wants there's obviously
whatever you want to call the og kush that Matt Bubba and Josh brought West to
LA there's that that started the whole LA thing yeah you know there's the TK
yep right there's an old one called the master that's not a Bubba og that I'm
not sure where it came from and there's supposedly the you know the Flowrider
okay and then from there from a bunch of bag seeds and everything else that
exploded into you know and there's debate on that too so like you know if
I left off some important thing or whatever don't get all pissy it's like a
hugely convoluted family yeah a lot of weird origins okay yeah we have early on
let me see SFV Larry we have Tahoe we have the soul assassin one through three
we have so I have to close my eyes to see it sorry the soul assassin one through
three we have we have the face offs I can't remember how many there were the
face offs archive can say then of course the 92 which who knows when that's from
there's a whole like pure kush family yeah there's one as far as I know
there's one pure kush and then everything else people called pure kush
which was a OG cut what were some of the other ones Louis of course there
there were like private reserve OG the weird ones that could have been anything
the platinum OG Skywalker OG was early fire OG thank you Paris Paris for me was
later I don't know that came later there is a F cut yeah so there's an aspect
where you could literally walk into a club in LA in 2009 or something or eight
and it would be like 25 listed OG's from different people yeah like it took
over Southern California and as a result of that some of those are probably
renamed some of those are probably bag seeds you know there was like I mean it
was literally went from like we don't even know how many cuts and if there were
sisters to each other it does seem a few different cushy things came out of
Florida be a different people yeah and hit California and spread from there
yeah and then it exploded into its own family but it's like a whole episode in
itself so if we want to keep to like the the timeline or whatever of reading off
more plants we could probably talk about OG for an hour yeah those are the ones
like and there were other ones but that people are named but those were most of
the early ones you know I hear people constantly saying oh we got that diamond
you know that old shit and I'm like no there's like a very small list of the
OG's that were going around and then everything after that was shot off after
that like you know the planetary OG's that people mentioned were later renamed
some stuff but it was during this time the planetary OG's were going around p91
p91 I'll let Matt talk about this one much more than me it's his it's his
wheelhouse it's an old San Diego strain there's a lot of different stories
behind it a lot of different claims to who has made it everything from saying
it was like the g-13 story strapped to a Berkeley story yeah there's all kinds of
crazy crazy different things that could be I think it's some kind of like I can
see silver pearl super skunks some kind of Afghani somethings but yeah it's a
what most people consider a classic old Indica predating the OG craze in SoCal
it was one of the big ones like Bull Rider and all the others yeah it's it's
it's got his name p91 either from Poet Classic 91 or peanut 91 we don't know
there's just endless arguments but it does have a weird nutty turt profile
nutty kind of acrid it's weird man it's weird it's a good cut though yeah so
next next we got Pez I don't know Pez very well Pez you know CSI has it yes
it's a Northern Lights type plant it's one of it's one of those ones where you
get frustrated because you wish that is it 5x2 is it NL skunk one is it this
that whatever but it got renamed but it looks like a classic 90s NL yeah you
know in that like it's bright green and has those nice hairs that like you know
yeah it just looks like a classic bag of 90s hydro to me all right here's one
that's your wheelhouse perps perps maybe talk about your perps and other perps
you know yeah perps is just I mean perps has been with us forever I think in a
way there's a lot of plants up in my neck of the woods that turn purple with
fall but then sort of the ones that like everybody is kind of familiar with
you know is the Mendo P and then all the stuff that got famous in the purple
cribs yeah the Urkel the grape ape we chatted about that a bunch and I
mentioned most of the story of the Mendo P but I believe it's it's from the late
70s grown in Mendocino County and put in this dude's closet for a couple decades
until I got it in the late 90s yeah and I have no idea what it is except for he
remembered where he grew it because he said it was the only purple weed he ever
grew and it was growing in Covalo in the late 70s and I tend to believe him just
because it tests like very within the range of most 70s cannabis yeah and you
you breed with it and it's got just an enormously wide gene pool so I remember
I had something I wanted to ask you I thought about it earlier today with the
perps so when you talk when you told the story you were talking about how he
gave you some seeds in a bag of weed and the seeds he gave you were from the 70s
but when you brought it back he said oh that's that purple one do you think it
was from the same era as the so the thing is is that he thought he was
giving me different seeds yeah and I can't even remember what it was supposed
to be and there was and like I said I only there was only two of them that
popped one male and one girl the boy died and when I got this weed it was so
royal purple and smelled so crazy yeah I didn't know what it was so I brought it
to him and I said this doesn't look like you know what it was supposed to be and
the only reason why I know the year is because he said that's the only purple
weed I ever grew and I grew it here okay and so that's really that's really all I
know he didn't know Jack he just said it was you know they were playing around
with with like Afghans and stuff that wasn't sativa that was faster guys were
starting to mix that in you know or whatever yeah and so they were trying
stuff and he said he grew it one year that's it so I know oh no shit yeah so
that's it yeah that's okay so he the year applied to the the purse not the
other so I got it in so I got it in yeah I got he didn't he didn't tell me a year
until and he said the only reason why he even remembered that year is because it
was the only time he grew weed that was purple like that got it you know so so
he remembered the year later when I actually showed him flower yeah and you
know CSI's bread with it a bunch I have other people have it's obviously it's
it's super super turpy low THC and super wide band as far as diversity yeah
there's a lot in there yeah you know so and when I got it in 1998 so at the time
those seeds were 21 years old 22 years old yeah 21 years old something like
that you know and that was now that was 24 years ago people obsessing over your
fucking hair it's killing me all right yeah all right so purple I was gonna do
purple indica but since Fletch is getting on a plane I don't want to cover
purple indica I've never grown pure purple indica so I can't really comment
on it but you can see our last interview with archive and we covered purple indica
pretty well there so it's it's a good call back to that episode which is
available on YouTube and Spotify and all that purple purple hurt the urk what was
your first experience with her when's the first time you saw it and smoked it
and your your feelings on it probably 2003 2000 2003 okay for sure
easily 2003 it started getting passed around Mendo as you know the thing to
grow yeah it was super slow growing but there was a huge demand for it yeah you
know I still think there's a fairly mysterious origin of it or whatever and
yeah so it's one of the few strings that has gotten that famous that we don't
know like a crew that came out with it yeah we only have like some certain
claims that are not nobody's sure nobody's really there's some claims to
it but nobody's really sure and you know the lavender and which I think later got
attributed to Soma but I'm not sure if it is the one that got famous is yeah
yeah but the lavender and the earth came at the same time yeah you know and my
buddy that gave me the tan Joe he got the lavender from McKinleyville humble
in humble and I had gotten the urkel from a source in Mendo and we showed
each other flower and they were pretty similar yeah they weren't exactly the
same but like we got the cuts those two cuts within six months of each other I
remember my first experience with urkel was something similar and I saw a cut of
lavender around the same time and they were obviously related the the urkel cut
and the lavender cut to me were obviously related so from that point on
I always assumed that urkel must have come from the lavender seed line you
know because I saw the clone that must be real lavender but I don't know if if
that was just like an urkel bag seed rename just being sold as lavender
because lavender was popular popular yeah my so my opinion is that the
original urkel and the original lavender were somewhat closely related and they
popped up on the scene and up here and they basically at the exact same time
but then Soma has a line that he sold for years named lavender yes and so
anybody that pops seeds of that would obviously call it lavender and so
there's different lavenders that float around there's also someone from Oregon
that claims they made that lavender I can't remember his name off the top of
my head but claims he made it and that Soma hijacked it from him and the guy
was known for making other stuff too so it wasn't like a just a random bold
claim it was it was something that might have merit it's very interesting yeah
and then it's so it's like one of those things where I just think that like the
urkel is a little easier because there was one urk and you know and then the
lavender it's like there was the cut that I remember and then there was Soma
selling thousands of seeds of something called lavender yeah and so a lot of
people think that the lavender is Soma's yeah a lot of people apparently
think it's mad farters too but that's a that's been tantamount I mean it's been
disproven it's been smashed the piece but I the first lavender I saw was
before Soma had was selling seeds of it so yeah I don't I don't think you know
yeah all right um so someone mentioned this in here and I think it's it's a
great one to bring up do you have experience with permafrost permafrost
yeah I actually don't but I do think that that and like coral reef or
something are two things that homie archive has been hunting for yeah and I
do remember permafrost from smoking it from some of those Ron parties in the
early 2000s but I never grew it myself so I don't have a bunch of comments on
it I only got it and passed it to an idiot but it's a white widow train wreck
if I remember correctly that's what people said it was that's about all I
had to comment on it I never got to grow it like that it was potent it had a nice
flavor it was super frosty I just remember it looking like snow yeah a little bit in my head
well you cross white widow I mean train wreck and white widow are both pretty
crystally things yeah in that era or whatever so it had that aft you know I
don't know it it was pretty all right let's see purple effects purple effects
purple effects was made by me if you can consider accidents made by someone so I
had I had this strain called effects which was a garlic bud yeah that Tim
Blake one of Tim Blake's main workers gave to me in the late 90s and you know
and so I I had this room going of a bunch of different stuff and it was
summer and an air conditioner died and it got hot for a couple of days until we
repaired it and the Mendo P as it can sometimes do it harmed all over the
purple effect all of the X right so I ended up with these two effects plants
that had hundreds of Mendo P seeds yeah right and out of that those seeds came
what we called the purple effects yes it's in the can of Bible a couple of them
I think I don't know we grew up yeah we grew it a bunch it had it was it's
really killer weed the the turpogs used it in rosé and in sprite and some stuff
like that it's been floating around Laytonville it's the first it's the
first breeding that ever happened with the Mendo P yeah it was it was
feminized years before I even knew what that meant yeah in the era that we were
even suspect that using the seeds might be fucking shit up yeah because they
were all herm seed but I did it anyway because I love the plants so much and
all I had was two females so yeah you know and it came up so so yeah that's
that's the purple effects yeah that's one of those like I don't know if it's
necessarily a myth because it is true that if something firms it has that
trade it may pass it on to the progeny but it also might not and also might not
be triggered by something that normally would trick trigger stuff so it you know
it that was one of those things for sure that I always heard is oh you better not
pop don't make with the herb you're gonna get arms you know buddy asked how
did the accident happen the Mendo P Herms right and if she undergoes
environmental stress it often makes her throw bananas yeah so like I said it was
summertime the AC broke it got hot for a couple of days until we could get the AC
repaired and she threw some bananas and just happened to pollinate the plants
that were right next to her on the tray whenever you're mad you often throw
bananas too it's really weird you know so yeah so that was that was the purple
effects it floated around it's in any number of different things it's really
really turpy and it's pretty potent all right and since you start I mean this is
one of those where there's pretty much one main clone going around a lot of
people had or at least one expression that pop-com commonly popped up enough
to be passed around as multiple clones maybe you ever grow any sense you start
I grew it for a little bit and to be perfectly honest I got rid of it and I
didn't I just thought of it as kind of a boring Afghan one of our friends is so
mad at you right now I know I know that doesn't mean that I grew the one you
know but that's true later on later on one version at least became pretty
famous and Luke is one of the people from paradise seeds he's refused to give
any lineage or any information about it it wasn't offered for all that that long
I don't think yeah it was not as regular seeds but as feminized seeds I
don't think he's ever stopped offering it you know things ever stopped offering
his family yeah so I just meant I don't you know the regular seeds was what like
it was like a four or five year period or something I don't even think it was a
four or five year period I think he gave someone testers that were as a friend
that person reproduced them which caused him to say fuck that I'm only doing
films from now on as I understand it Wow so yeah and it it gets claimed to be
so it's it seems to be a pretty good breeder there's a cut that floats around
yeah I mean there's a good there's another cut that floats around that was
called sensei star but is actually like a nirvana four-way something something
oh wow I could see that kind of translating a little bit confusing
people though yeah you know and so yeah there's there's like a history to it but
unfortunately it uh it wasn't offered for very long and you know there's a
couple cuts that float around you know and that's the other thing too it's like
not everybody thinks everything is elite yeah so sometimes you might get
something and grow it and it's not for you or you wasn't the right environment
for it and you have better things and you just move on and other people it's
the bees knees yeah I think we just recently did snow but you can cover it
again real quick just to plug it in here we did snow got famous in Oregon yep it
was called it was often called Oregon snow or Eugene snow even it made its way
down to humble and got called Humboldt snow yeah it was cropped by a bunch of
people CSI used to run it from though he's had a cut of it since the late 90s
and it was brought out from Florida by a couple people I know and it was called
skunk 5 in Florida yeah and it's a low Terps super frosty Afghan that
occasionally can be absolutely delicious and at other times can be a little bland
yeah but it's super potent it's a great breeder it seems anything you cross it
to makes nice plants and it's a it's heirloom yeah it's pretty purple isn't
it like pretty purple up pretty good you can get purple up at the end sure
yeah yeah okay we've done whole episodes on sour but might as well go ahead I
mean that the cool part I guess about sour is that more people in the sour
family are starting to speak up recently yeah that were involved you know Vondo
swell Manny you know people that really hadn't spoken up very much and so they've
confirmed some things you know sour sour came according to them came from
diesel to which they called headband so the first headband was a very sour type
skunk type plant that they found some seeds in yeah and they've called it our
diesel and that led to sour diesel you know it's been it's been covered but and
that is and that was something that you know the headband story and the
confusion around that a lot of tales spawned around it with people claiming
they had the real New York City headband they had the real this you take a famous
story that's light on detail and you're gonna get people to fill in detail sure
right you sure will and so with Manny and some of those other guys coming out
and telling their side of the story we actually have some stuff that used to be
just a version of the story yeah be kind of become the story yeah so that's cool
and and someone's asking about the original New York City diesel that's
exactly what we just talked about yeah and there's no there's a further
complication and that in that diesel was slang for fireweed in New York City back
then yes which is why they called the bag our diesel when they gave it to homie
because they wanted to differentiate it from all the other diesel coming around
and there's another cut named original diesel which may or may not be the cut
Matt has but there's a different guy that has it that's just the first diesel
that he got in Vermont and he stuck that label on it you know so anyway yeah yeah
and G's always called G's because it was G's diesel yeah one of the people in the
Kim crew yeah diesel yes the copies over another great name that not so calls it
um the cock so there's okay so yeah it's it's it's one of those things where it
could be an entire episode we're trying to condense it but and we've talked
about it before so yeah we have a whole episode about it shoreline did you ever
get to try any of the recent shoreline for our crew I did not know uh-uh I'm
not in the secret secret cool club but apparently not so I will let I will let
Matt describe the shoreline so I got to try outdoor versions and indoor versions
and the indoor was like hot garbage very well done I don't think it would it
would it might be a lot of lemon G in the way the bud is formed in that it's
not as pretty as modern weed that people would love but it is very it's resinous
and it's it's not airy airy but it's not super dense like like cookies or any of
those kinds it did smell like hot garbage I wouldn't say roadkill skunk I
would say hot garbage but that's my nose someone else might totally smell
something skunky as fuck in it and I could see how it could lean that way
because of the hot garbage not there's a little sweetness to it there's a little
bit of terpenelein somewhere in the background I think now the outdoor
version had the hot garbage but it also was loud as fuck with piss with and when
I say cat piss or I mean like human piss like not like terpenelein it was the
closest thing to cat piss smelling that actually smelled like urine so what's
funny about weed is that there are aromas and weed that are are strangely
attractive yeah that would be horrific in any other context yep you know
halitosis yeah yeah I mean some people liken the chem D to a dead body yeah
things of that new things that would be universally gross yeah you know end up
in weed because that description is sounds horrible to be honest yeah I mean
it's not horrible we have a bunch of friends that love it it's good weed I'm
not dissing it but I just mean that like when Matt was speaking about it yeah you
know it doesn't sound appealing I don't know if you're ordering that on the menu
as the guy prevents the specials you know yeah yeah smells like hot garbage
human pee yeah dead bodies actually smell like sweet shit if you didn't know
that sweet sweet rotten meat feces like when meat rots in a trash can for too
long and sweet the sweet yeah we have some good friends that run it multiple
good friends that run it and so it's in our it's in our pretty close circle of
friends and it's a really good cut it has a pretty complicated lineage I like
the high to we had a very good high I wouldn't say it's wickedly potent it's
not bad it's not bad at all it can hold its own yeah I mean you know me at the
good highs are around our base one yeah it's the most important thing so what's
next strawberry cough strawberry cough I like the cough quite a bit the strawberry
cough I think grown what grown especially organically it's a really
nice tasting up energetic buzz yeah I don't know how much I believe about the
story I don't believe it you know I think the story is pretty suspect I
think the person that tells it is pretty suspect
hi Kyle but you know but it is but it's a great cut yeah it is a good cut I don't
believe much about the story but I like the weed quite a bit I worked a lot with
the herd beer line which is a Swiss strawberry sativa I've worked a lot with
strawberry cough expressions in the strawberry cream that was from a
strawberry cough s1 I was positive absolutely positive that that expression
is just an earlier expression which is a super strawberry resinous not necessarily
make a potent but it's not terrible very dense the old earlier and strawberry
cough or damn near identical I mean it could be a hybrid of it of some sort I
don't even know if the years match up but goddamn if they're not identical in
every way so who knows who knows I would agree with that assessment I think at
its best it tastes really nice it has a good uplifting high it's not overpowering
and doesn't have any paranoia and it's not knock you down strong but it's not
weak either yeah it worked it works pretty well it burns nice when done well
you know it's a pretty nice little plant yeah um train wreck train wreck
train wreck to me is is famous for a couple reasons one it was one of the
first named clones that got passed around in humble and Mendo as a named
clone yeah like I think Caleb would even say it's probably one of the first
things that he got yes like that was that had a name to it it wasn't just
like seed lines or whatever right and it yielded big and it was frosty and it
looked good and it so it got grown a ton and it you know it was strong
terpenelein so it was a lot of people's first experience with a terpenelein bomb
type strain yeah and it had its moment in the Sun and now there's a bunch of
debate about the real one or the fake ones we have a good friend of ours we
have several good friends of ours actually that do work with with train
wrecks and they're a cool plant you know it flowers actually pretty fast outside
yeah for all of its sativa characteristics and all that it
actually because I think it triggers quick yeah like is what happens I love
the train wreck I love the high from it the resin production it does breed
dominant for those the the heavy terpenelein terps but I love the high
from it for me it's all anti-anxiety some people it fucking spins them out so
I don't recommend it for everyone but yeah our buddy Pat from Santa Cruz goat
farm has a bunch of train wreck reversals fem lines right now on right
siege calm so go check them out yeah and it was it was it was nice buds that got
thrown on a big sativa frame yep a lot of people will get two pounds of light
growing it so it became popular you know I see it coming back and and it's
gonna come back strong I think in hybrids I think I think on its own it's
very novel for the first you know if it's new to you it's novel and cool and
different if you've got a lot of Jack and a lot of Durbin a lot of
terpenelein stuff it may not be as cool but in the hybrids it fucking it shines
it shines yeah and what's funny about it is in that era people called terpenelein
trainwreck Turks yeah and then that got dethroned by Jack Turks it sure did
because Jack came along and took the title yeah away and and trainwreck never
didn't get talked about in that regard but in that era it was so strong
terpenelein you would talk about trainwreck Turk yeah trainwreck
definitely smells like trainwreck smells like the wreck here's one that you have
a lot more experience with especially the original and that's the Trinity the
trend yeah so it it is my introduction to the trend was basically there's some
people that know that are more tied into it than I was but it is one of these
things where supposedly it came out of a bag seed that came from Trinity County
that was traded to a glassblower that was traded to a glassblower for some
some pipes and they sprouted that seed in the Eugene glassblowing area scene
right and it sort of started spreading around that little group yeah you know
and it was kind of a dinosaur leaf plant some people got skunk off it some people
got burnt rubber some people got like a sweet pine it seemed to vary and it got
really popular in Oregon and then everyone lost it and it disappeared for
a long time yeah but it's a cool plant and and people are asking about the goat
monkey one that's the same one that we have all gotten and grown in our circle
too and I I don't I didn't have experience with the original Trinity so
I don't know I couldn't say if it's real or not but I know CSI and specter and
and not so or attempting to figure that out in some way shape or form by
reaching out to the original dudes yeah and I mean part of the part of the issue
is too is that I have a bunch of friends that had it but then what is your 15 or
18 year old memory yeah that's so that really does play into it when you
haven't seen something in a super long time but you had it 98 or 99 can you
absolutely guarantee yeah you know and most people that think it's not it think
it's like it's it's at the very least the hybrid yeah half my friends think
it's it the other half are and most of the people that aren't sure it's it is
because they people can grow it's so nice now mm-hmm it doesn't look like it
yeah in a way it gets a little bigger than what they remember yeah and that's
the thing we grow so much different than we used to and people don't realize how
vastly different people grow than they used to but you know what's funny about
that is so I got it back and then that was the year that I got evacuated from
my spot due to a fire yeah and then it froze and so I had some small trends out
there and they went through hell and almost died but they came back and
finished yeah and every person I showed that jar it was like leafy and sparse
buds and all that everyone thought I had the nose to the teeth yeah and everyone
was convinced it was it and then the next year I grew it in perfect conditions
in a greenhouse and fully organic and fed it really nice and it came out with
fat bugs and people were like oh it looks too nice yeah it can't be the
trend you got it to get nice buds yeah that's impossible it's it's a leafy
shitty see-through type of strain yeah so you know yeah the good part is is the
one that's the one that's floating around right now yeah it's strong weed
and people are often surprised when they smoke it how high they get
oh interesting regardless so yeah it knocked hip on his ass that's funny it
did it surprised them how stoned he got we didn't even finish the joint when he
was visiting one time so regardless of whether or not it's actually the real
one the one that floats around is an excellent strain in my opinion let's
show I'll clown on myself to show how different people grew at least me in
2006 than now this is a picture of clockwork of me trying like it's vastly
different there's no resin production on this thing you know what I mean a lot of
people are growing like that going through these old books like that is
just what we looked like that nobody yeah there wasn't really a lot of
self-assessment going on I have you know I have friends that talk about that
where you know they grew in five gallon pots with plain water and all in soil
amendments we have metal halides in Oregon in a rudimentary 97 you know year
1997 setup yeah you know and you know you're obviously 25 years later if
you're still growing weed you're probably better at it yeah then I was
growing in hundred-degree rooms like no like no issues just stop talking so I
believe Oh Williams wonder did you go to the MLB or any of the Williams wonder
cuts going around I have grown Williams wonder the one I like it it's not
particularly potent but it is a large yielding and to me like sweet and very
old-school stellar smelling Afghan that stacks yeah it's kind of a it's not
brown it's a little tannish maybe in kind of the way that it grows yeah like
the the bud formation or whatever and there's still people in the Pacific
Northwest or at least was five or six years ago that were growing it selling
it to old people getting three pounds of light so it floats around yeah and then
you know various breeders have used it because anything that has a tendency to
throw donkey dick style buds they want to mix that into their seed lines oh
sure especially back then yeah so you know but it's one of I think it's one of
those old seed lines that like people get excited about and it would probably
occasionally throw a really nice plant but it probably has a decent propensity
of junk yeah and if you want the truth you know yeah a lot of those 80s and 90s
varieties had some crazy elites in them but they might have like a 20% of it
might be trash that's the way I feel like going back and looking at a lot of
the different 80s and 90s indica's that were being pushed out from Amsterdam
but they're Afghani's the different Afghani plans and stuff the hash plants
and stuff there was a lot of fucking just subpar stuff so far looking anyways
you know cookies kind of changed the game as far as requiring what we needs
to look like yeah people were certainly willing to accept much uglier cannabis
as long as it worked well yeah smoked good you know okay now we're gonna enter
the list of things that we've added in or what have you do you want to start
with your list or mine you go for yours okay first is gonna be crystal chunk
since it's fresh on your memory crystal chunk this one could also be for a while
so the crystal chunk I actually found out a little bit more about just this
past couple weeks so how crystal chunk is important to me is that it was the
first clone that my friend gave me to grow indoor with yeah in my one lighter
right we all remember our first and so it yeah I grew the crystal chunk and
then there was a number of people in Chicago that grew the crystal chunk it
made its way out to Colorado it made its way to Montana and there was various
circles of people that grew it it was a it was an NL of some kind it was popped
in 88 or 89 in Carbondale Illinois and it was a number of things these guys
used to go to to Neville every year and buy seats and then they would come back
to Carbondale which is in far southern Illinois it's a college town down there
and they would blow up indoors and then in order to not get busted in their
college town they would sell the weed in the huge city of Chicago like four
hours north right and that kept them anonymous in their hometown right and so
that's the chunk the chunk is some kind of NL from Neville in 88 or 89 I don't
know if it's still alive I think not yeah I have some friends that have
hybrids in it I brought it to California in 98 I moved out here I lost it in no
I think maybe so but it's a cool one super potent low odor low low smell low
taste do we know if that clone is still around I don't my buddies that I just my
buddies that I just went and visited said that it existed as late as 2013 oh
wow so kicking around till then and there's see and they gave me some seeds
of it oh hybrid not pure you know not reverse yeah but but but mixed with
other shit so we'll see other cool shit yeah 100% yes I'm excited to hear about
that sometime deep chunk somebody just said finally hearing about crystal chunk
first kind but I experienced how interesting that's good I mean those
guys down in Carbondale they grew a bunch they grew but I had more than that
but that the chunk kind of got spread around a little bit and became pretty
famous in those little circles yeah you know did you say deep chunk deep chunk
deep chunk is pretty famous in various ways I would say it floated around
Mendocino we were just talking about this yesterday it floated around
Mendocino because that's kind of where one of the places it was developed as
monkey balls yes we all get cabbage we all called it monkey balls back then
because it was like golf ball size purplish super you know chunky some were
frosty and it was grown a lot on Spirock yeah and so a lot of people I knew that
grew grew it grew it out that way then it became famous in another way because
Tom Hill made it and he ended up becoming pretty famous on the forums
yes right and so he had he had a with Vic high and other he became very he was
sort of one of the big personalities for a long time on the forums I would
say yeah right after he was super intelligent super knowledgeable super
cantankerous yeah you know didn't have a lot of patience for idiocy oh we
suffered no fools no he didn't have a lot of patience for idiocy and then it
might actually be it might actually be one of the only IBLs out there yeah
that's I noticed someone was saying that they just have seen people taking
it to f13 on selling and selling seeds of it like deep trunk was already as
close to IBL as you're gonna get if people keep taking that inwards
generations I'm not sure what they're trying to achieve other than making more
seed maybe but eventually you're gonna suffer from some heavy heavy inbred
depression no matter what you do with it at that point it was already it was
already where it needed to be yeah there's people saying purple monkey
balls monkey balls was pretty common in Mendel like if you got cold October
nights yeah most of the plant would purple up you know yeah and in that
regard and so it was like that's how I got introduced to it it's just one of
those old-time Hill strains yeah and the problem with purple chunk in my you know
deep chunk in my opinion is that it is what it is and it breeds very much like
itself yeah and you're not going to be surprised yeah yeah so if you like that
and that's what you want to add in and you want to add in some of those
qualities you can't yeah I've seen very good seed lines of deep chunk I know CSI
inspector has some and KOS the rev has an amazing one but I've seen very very
bad resin lists just terrible deep chunks which a resin list deep chunk is
a disappointing thing yeah so it can you know on the right the right hybrid the
right out cross it can pop yeah and it can lend qualities to it that make it
overall amazing and it can also just kind of be a very boring leafy not fun
high Afghan yeah someone asked it's a good question and and it'll be good to
answer it's like a lot of people probably don't understand this if plants
get inbreeding depression how do you get land races so land races are constant
big populations wild populations and there is some inbreeding that goes on
but because it's a wild diverse population it's always going to be a
little bit diverse as it goes you know some do get inbreeding depression some
and lots of land races are just pure like CBD heavy low THC you know her
machines and that's just what cannabis wants to be another another way to
describe the scale of it is that when we talk about inbreeding depression mostly
we're talking about small indoor greenhouse style selections with maybe
you know like you know anywhere from one to a few males perhaps and you know
certain amount of females where what Matt was describing if you're in Mexico
or Thailand or whatever is fields of weed yes with thousands of brothers and
sisters right yeah and that's where the seeded comes from and so as a result of
that you're gonna get like a much wider population that's when we start messing
with them in much smaller non field size environments yeah that you can get in
bread pretty quick oh yeah somebody was asking me if we can speak on Tom Hills
Hayes yeah I mean there's not a clone that goes around to that so but yeah
it's a it's a famous strain of his if it was pretty notorious for the fact that
like Doug would tell people you know you need a good 10 packs to find a
keeper it's just is what it is on that it was from positronics there Hayes 19
is is from Sam's Hayes if I remember correctly yeah so yeah he positronics is
one of the three people besides Sam that Sam gave Hayes to when he went to
Amsterdam yeah he gave it to Neville he gave it to
Correll from super Sativa seed club and he gave it to posse yeah and he actually
worked at posse for a bit as far as like just helping making breeding selections
and things of that nature so Tom Hills Hayes is from the Hayes that Sam gave
deposit yeah and it's not a lot of hey hey this would be a great name for it
it's very hey and carat II and lots of hey lots of carrot hey but I did see
some really beautiful examples of it from hazy lady over on mr. nice and I'm
not sure she deleted her account after key play adapter but there might those
pictures might still be up there and if you want to see a beautiful Hayes look
for hazy ladies hazy why a lady why her grove Tom Hills Hayes and there's an
aspect to where like even when even when like the Flying Dutchman or
whatever was selling Sam's Hayes yeah his Oh Hayes or whatever you know they
even said that like only 10% of them are gonna be you kind of have to hunt a lot
and there's a lot of junk in that Hayes yeah and the problem with Hayes is that
since most of it goes 16 to 24 weeks you know searching for the needle in a hay
stack and having the space to run a hundred of them yeah and then smoke test
them and figure out which one or two are the ones that are good and the rest
they're mostly bunk yeah that's hard yeah it's time-consuming and jungle weed
and a lot of space okay silver pearl did you get to try oh yeah what you think it
reminded me of the silver pearl I knew in the 90s in the sense that this is
gonna sound gross again but it has this like there's this thing when babies are
firstborn and all they drink is milk and they're getting a lot of their moms
like colostrum or whatever yeah and baby poo kind of has this like sweet like
it's it's just it's not really all that gross yeah right and then they start
eating real different foods and it's like that's just shit you know but yeah
but the silver pearl has this kind of like sweet young young baby poo type
smells and I smelled that in his cut that is so wild I got pick out like
bubble gummy but not pink bubble gum like some kind of sweet and then not
skunky but somewhere along that direction it's so hard to describe but
it's one of my favorite smells I mean the other thing is that like you know I
had kids and you didn't so there's a point when you have aromas that what
reminds you of what yes like we talked about how there's no skunks in Europe
you have to be actually exposed to the smell to have smelling something else
trigger that memory yes I've not got my nose a baby shit yeah yeah so you know
the silver pearl was to get a little bit more specific I believe silver pearl
is a mix of early girl skunk one and nl5 yes and it is a pretty leafy frosty nice
smelling you know you know it was an early polyhybrid from Neville it was it's
a great resin dumper for like dry sifted shit too it is so frosty but it
is so leafy and very frosty and you know back then especially like most things
were most things that were getting released were f1s yeah and so that was
that was sort of in the first wave of polyhybrids of different crosses he'd
made and then combining those into into different things yeah so that's silver
pearl it's a cool old it's a cool old line from both the seed bank in the 80s
from Neville and from the years of senses yep okay amnesia fucking Hayes
it was a US obviously but I mean you can't really talk about that era of
clones within the world without mentioning amnesia Hayes I mean I think
I think amnesia Hayes is sort of like you know I don't want to be wrong here
but I associate amnesia Hayes with after Neville put out super silver Hayes and
mango Hayes and Neville's Hayes and sort of stopped contributing yeah and
greenhouse sort of reconstituted their seed company right yeah that was one of
the that was the thing that came out after that right yeah for the most part
yeah yeah yeah and so I'm sort of super silver Hayes and so there's an aspect
where there's this is highly disputed so no one take this the wrong way but if
you listen to Neville and Shanti they claim that after Neville's experience at
sensei they didn't want to give Arjun all the clones and seeds and and all that
so they controlled all that and they just gave greenhouse flower and seed for
sale yeah so when they left to do their own thing Arjun had probably the most
famous at the time between him and sensei he had the most famous award
winning seed bank and he is his breeders left yeah and so he brought on Franco
and rumor is is that he bought twenty or thirty thousand euros worth of his own
seed stock yeah and they started breeding and doing various things trying
to come up with seed for their seed company yeah and I think that's where
like Arjun's Hayes one through five and amnesia Hayes and you know lemon this
and all that started happening yeah you know and that's that's amnesia Hayes to
me yeah I don't remember who did I think it's like hypro or order lab or one of
them made amnesia if I were amnesia I can't remember the fucking story but
it's it's not it's not so much or whoever else people are saying yeah I
think it's I think it's one of those things too that like it's one of those
renames that like they took some other Hayes in Amsterdam to sell at coffee
shops and like we did in Cush in LA and just give it a new name that one's it's
good it's a it's a almost fruity floral that's best way I can describe it
terpenelein but it's it's nice it's resinous it's potent I see why it was
passed around for so long it's consistently a great Hayes I think I
like I like it so yeah it's good did you ever run any blue cheese yeah yeah did
you have a cut you liked or the gas around so when we were chatting about
those those Ron's parties and where a lot of us were gathering in those years
there was a lot of cool things crossed of the blue family and while I didn't
really like a lot of the straight blue stuff yeah a lot of the out crosses were
really good yeah and blue cheese there was blue widow blue cheese blue rhino
blue rhino there was a bunch of different blue hybrids out crosses that
I actually preferred that the straight blue lines yeah and blue cheese was one
of those ones yeah you know so I didn't grow it a bunch or anything like that
but it was a it was a pretty sweet floral you know slightly skunk one-ish
type plant yeah you know I mean there was there was a bunch of seeds passed
around by friends too oh yeah it wasn't just a cut I mean it was like you know
there was there was people that had crosses and there was f2s yeah so did
you ever have any experience with it uh no but I did make a blue cheese with the
blue bonnet that I really enjoy and that was just because so many people
over the years asked me if I had a good blue cheese that I would recommend I'm
like blue fucking cheese I did not want anything to do with cheese in the first
place it was everywhere it was a British thing so during those years like when I
heard blue cheese I'm not regressive but I did find that it is a fucking amazing
combo and I was just being an asshole you cross cool things to skunk one and
nice things come out of it yeah why it's been a breeder standard for decades
here's one that's a little self-serving but it was so huge in San Diego that I
think it was pretty huge everywhere actually
bubble berry bubble berry yeah yeah did you have those cuts up there yeah we had
some bubble berry I believe it was it was first offered by sag Martha yeah I
think right yep yep that was a total strain you know DJ short sent a bunch of
blue family seeds to sag Martha for them to retail them through their their
business yeah and Tony crossed some blue work you know to some bubble gum yep and
the bubble berry was born and the bubble gum is famously mold resistant and
throws a very consistent type Afghan beautiful plant yeah and the above the
blueberry added turps and color and some frost and some attractiveness and
some other weird stuff and so there was a good cut that floated around that
everybody kind of loved yeah it was it was well loved in San Diego to is one of
my favorite strains that the big lead to pink bubble gum with heavy heavy like
blueberry jam insane and and what's funny is I look at the old pictures of
from Tony back in the day and he obviously used the same line of bubble
gum that we used however it wasn't the same clone and and the blue no use was
on it and they used a blueberry mill which similar lines however they look
uncannily similar when crossed and I it might be because bubble gum breed so
true you know but it looks damn similar even all these years separated different
parentage but similar similar lineage it is it's a cool-looking plant and it's
very consistent when crossed even even in the same family yeah and it's it
there's cool pictures of it from olden times from the 90s Matt various breeders
have done work with it yep you did work with it
bog did stuff with it right you know bog bubble yeah that based on it in a way
yeah like oh he was that was a bubble gum I don't think it's bubble Barry you
don't think it was bubble Barry no it's bubble gum yeah but we're gonna go or
something yeah anyway it was it was it was a cool line it's it's a good example
of how when two things that are very different from each other come together
for the first time yeah you can pop some cool plants yeah absolutely yeah people
are still talking about blue rhino blue this blue that blue the blue out crosses
I'll say this too there was a very limited number of people outside the
Amsterdam seed banks in the late 90s and early 2000s that got famous on the
forums and there were certain forums of watching of some blueberry grows you've
got everybody hyped on blueberry yep and so people started getting blueberry and
since it was obviously reg seeds they started crossing it to other lines and
that's when all those cool hybrids came out so like in the early 2000s blue and
white hybrids what the white widow family and the blue family they were
crossed to all kinds of things including each other yep all right um um Maui wow
we I this is kind of a weird one because it's one of those ones where I a lot of
people don't see the same Maui wowie twice I think Maui wowie is a lot like
the Alaskan Thunderfuck or creepy or diesel or you know fire yeah you know it
was probably it was probably a sativa Afghan grown on Maui yeah and it rhymes
and that makes it easy to sell and so it was probably applied to a bunch of
different types of Hawaiian weed yeah I think that's probably the most accurate
thing to say about it yeah I think that's that's that's fair
how about lambs bread or lambs breath or whatever you know I don't have any
personal experience with that one but it was supposed to be a wild sativa like
20-25 weeks yeah it came out of Jamaica yep and was supposed to be pretty famous
it was before Jamaica got inundated with your European weed strains yeah and
started growing mostly Dutch shit yep and as a result of that it's a little
bit before my time and I don't even know that I ever saw one that I believe was
true this is the only one that I remember seeing and I'm like okay that
makes sense for a long flowering Indian sativa type this was the pictures from
Jason King and the Canada Bible when he went to Jamaica and had to pay them
fucking a shitload of money to take pictures of their crops yeah I mean I'll
say the more follow you know the the expression on that one I could see that
thing taking 24 weeks yeah easily easily yeah that thing's a calyx II mess okay
let's move on to Malawi I know there are certain clones of Malawi passed up in
oh certain clones of Malawi passed around up in humble right yeah nor Cal
I should say I had a Malawi that its biggest issue was that it it never
wanted to finish for me yeah which is not a convenient trait you know and you
know Malawi is one of those things where there's a lot Africa is probably
the continent with the most weed that we have the least amount of its genetics
that like fresh genetics over here yeah it seems like there was an initial
seeding during like the slave trade era when there was an enormous amount of
ships coming from Africa to the Caribbean and stuff like that yeah so a
lot of like maybe Mexican and Caribbean weed ancient origins tied to there but
you talk about the Congo and the Malawi and this and that and everything else
and you know maybe Durban is the most common thing that we have from Africa
Swazi and urban yeah because there's a stuff that rolled that all that a lot of
that African weed rolls right through the equatorial region yeah which means
that it takes forever which means that it's a ginormous pain in the ass for
anyone in America unless it's crossed to something Afghan that makes it yeah yep
and by manageable we usually mean like 12 or 14 or 15 weeks or something
there's a red Congolese that's pretty tightly held by some people that they'd
love yeah that's that's kind of like that it was crossed to some very Afghan
thing to get it's I remember that red Congo is like a Congo Afghani Wahakon or
something like it's not you I mean the Malawi or the cop like there's you got
to do some shit to tame it yeah you have live in America you don't live in the
tropics yeah it's super hard to get those to flower under like reasonable
times indoors to yeah you know like a 24 week something and it's like unless you
start light tapping it in June you're not making your season yeah you're
screwed you know and then you grow it inside and it's like this jungle weed
that's leafy it takes like six months like you know it's hard yeah it's hard
Apollo let's just say let's let's call this the the the Brothers Grimm when I
see Brothers Grimm I mean sly and it with some assistance from soul and
marketing one more thing here as we chat about this stuff there's tons of
cool comments and various questions popping up but at the rate we're talking
about stuff there's no chance I have to answer even most of them so I apologize
yeah yeah we're going through a like a categorized list this time so it's
really hard to answer questions at rapid-fire you know but if they're
important do you remember them and you can hit me up a bottom later so yeah I
just want to throw that out there join us on the patreon discord and we like
she talked about this shit all the time so you can ask us anything all the time
and get multiple responses oh yeah from people smarter than myself you know so
we're gonna call this the the Brothers Grimm selection of clones which is
princess cafe girl fucking ginger ale cut we got what else we got princess cafe
girl blah blah blah there's another one Oh genius genius which leads to the
Apollo 13 the special cuts of that the Apollo 11 all that good stuff all that
good stuff c99 pineapple but which of those do you have experience with the
most this this ties into a bunch of stuff I already said but I would say
that just like DJ the original Brothers Grimm crew came out at a time when there
wasn't very many non Dutch breeders doing things publicly so a lot of their
work got heavily spread amongst the community yeah especially the early
forum community yeah just like DJ short I just said became famous Brothers Grimm
became pretty famous there was endless posts on fucking cubing and how he took
the the original seed he got from the Jack Herrera and turned it into c99 and
you know the Apollo 11 the Apollo 13 the genius there was a whole bunch of
stuff so again when I was going to those parties of Ron's a lot of the things
that were the stuff that was the most common to be crossed with was the blue
family the white family breeder Steve's work and a lot of Brothers Grimm yeah I
love the genius I grew the I had the Apollo and the genius in that era I got
them from friends that I met through there yeah they were both nice smoke
yeah you know I thought I've always thought this Cinderella 99 was a little
bullshit ish yeah I loved absolutely loved the pineapple phenol c99 I was a
sucker for it to pinning and pineapple together make it taste like pineapple I
was fucking fire but brothers Graham was really famous yeah in that era yeah a
lot of their stuff was getting passed around a lot of their straight clones
that people found that got names and hybrids yeah I would um I did a lot of
work with Apollo 13 that's when I chose between the 11 and the 13 I chose the
13 had a lot of really nice great phenos come out of that there was some good
lemon phenos that were more dense and Afghani looking then the the grape
super sativa purple looking pretty shit but yeah I maybe we should know that
what we're talking about is the original organization of brothers Graham yeah I
don't know anything about the second iteration of the second one where where
the fly wasn't involved and mr. soul and and you know Duke had something going on
like that was and there was like a 15-year break or something where there
was no seat yeah so we're talking about the early late early 2000s first when
they first got famous yeah not they were reconstituted decades later not when the
marketing guy tried to put it back together put the team back together
without the team yeah let's see let's skip through those we did shoreline
here's one that I have some interesting info on but I can't say who or where
RFK skunk RFK skunk yeah you know I don't know I mean RFK skunk was
supposedly you know skunk it's got a lot of things right so it's RFK is is where
the the Washington Redskins played right the Grateful Dead there was a bunch of
dead shows they was on the when they would do their summer tour yeah RFK was
was one of the big stadiums that they would always play in yeah you know and
all that and supposedly that RFK came out of bud from RFK I'm beating myself
up right now cuz I just realized that RFK is probably gonna pop up tomorrow
and some lamers list of stuff that they're claiming to have but yeah it
got mixed it's like so there's a there's a whole series of like mysterious
East Coast skunks from the same area some might be renames right yeah it's
been rumored to be in a bunch of different things but proof is love yeah
perhaps yeah yeah we'll see we'll see one might be out there of this and it'd
be growing and gonna see about it so I'm pretty stoked because it's one that
there's very little info about out there as far as what it was like blah
blah blah like I mentioned with the headband story before Manny and those
others cleared it up where there's very little info but it's still fairly famous
it allows a lot of room for people to say whatever they like about it yeah
because there's very little verifiable info so maybe that is the verifiable
info yeah you don't know you know Romulan Romulan is another one that is
weird in the sense that there's a lot of funky stories about it and and they keep
getting earlier and earlier yeah what we know for sure is that it's Canadian you
know that's where it got famous and when it I believe it basically got
first like nationally or internationally famous when the Canadian seed companies
started jumping into the seed game and there was a lot of hybrids crossed
around yeah and there's some stories about that it came from Mendo and like
and Mendo Joe and it was brought to British Columbia it was this and this
and it came back and these crazy early years yeah I don't know what you think
of that Matt but I from everything that I've researched on it talking to people
at BC and other parts of Canada who were around during that time and had
interaction with those crews Mendocino Joe was a hundred thousand percent not
Romulan Joe Romulan was also not from the 40s it sounds like it was from the
fucking 90s and if I remember correctly and I'm only I'm only repeating because
I I'm not from Canada obviously Port Alberni Pine Bud was one of its first
names and there was another name something blue indica with and then
later on it was made popular in the 90s with the different name change but yeah
it's not a there's no such thing as a 1940s Afghani hybrid so it's one of
those things when I hear it it just makes my eyes cross and it's also it's
also kind of kind of a cool thing in the sense that a lot of cannabis names were
very much tongue-in-cheek about like pop culture yeah and so Romulan is
actually you know obviously it's a race of aliens from Star Trek yes you know
yeah yes so 40 Star Trek so Star Trek yeah so the Romulan did you ever have
that grapefruit Romulan or the grom you Lynn no no yeah it was okay it was a
weird one that went around San Diego a bunch and like no matter what clones you
were trying to chase you'd always end up right back at square one with
Romulan how about just grapefruit grapefruit there was a you know there's
a there's a pretty famous phenol of Soma's diesel mm-hmm that had grapefruit
flavor yeah and some people bred with it and loved it a ton and it had really
strong grapefruit turps yeah which is about as far from sour turps as you can
imagine but yes yes nonetheless they really loved it and that's the only like
and that's the only real grapefruit I have ever I've ever experienced there
was a real popular well most phenols of c99 that are popped from seed come out
very grapefruity to me it smells it was weird when people explain grapefruit and
give me grapefruit bud like super grapefruity I always smell fucking
perfume it's weird it's one of those things where I just smell it so much
different yeah people are talking about all kinds of skunks and stuff like that
and I'll say something real quick I do think in the 90s skunk was a much more
prevalent odor I do think it popped up in hybrids a lot more frequently but you
know skunk bud tended to not be quite as potent as some other weed and it had
really noticeable turps that got you in trouble and so I think it just got
selected away from too much yeah and by various people and then as clones
changed and names changed people went to different stuff and everyone assumed
that people would be holding it and now it seems like a lost turp yeah you know
and it's also possible it could be a little bit of a recessive turp now where
it needs other genes from another partner to like make it pop yeah and
they're buried double up double up where in the 90s maybe it was an easy double
up mm-hmm and now 30 years later it's like a rarer double up yeah because
you've talked you've talked about I can't remember who made it but you were
telling me what was the sour dub Fino yeah it was a diesel sourdough crust
to rehearse diesel for the pan sourdough by diesel so you know he
Matt's cross diesel to all kinds of things and one time this one hybrid all
the sudden throws you know a much more skunky shit yeah yeah so I think that's
probably where it'll pop back up again is will be it'll be a lucky recessive
combo yeah I know crybaby did a GMO chisel that I thought would probably
hold it pretty well or even a D diesel or any of those things any any
combination of the the like sour version of super skunk and the short
squat version of super skunk to me seems to just kind of bring it up quite well
quite well yeah I mean I think if you start crossing I mean we've talked about
that a bunch we start crossing different skunky things in large enough numbers
yeah and you'll find some stuff yeah you know it's just not going to be crossed
the skunk one will take you farther away from your goal than closer yeah there's
a lot of people that have had sourdough some people look at me like silly when I
say sourdough you can grow up very fucking skunky if you know how to bring
out skunkiness out of strains but some people are just like oh I never never see
it I don't know some people have had really loud sourdough and some people
have it I'm never sure if it's the same clone or just way different growth
styles I mean there's definitely a you know my friend that I visited he grows a
lot of living soil yeah and I definitely noticed like a pretty extreme sweetness
to a lot of things you know so I definitely think you know room
temperature and feeding and you know type of feeding and stuff like that can
certainly different plants can definitely bring out different aspects
yeah so so one that was big around the forums during overgrow era I believe was
Jackie Oh did you ever see Jackie Oh it was a I believe Jack flash Fino
across the Calio indeed that was in Naboo one if I remember correctly it's
pretty good it was a good Calio hybrid that it tastes like citrus or did it go
beyond that oh it was super citrus and super
terpene lean oh yeah yeah yeah two extreme flavors combined in one yes super
citrus and super terpene lean so then we all since we're bringing up Calio bring
up Calio in the Milton did you have any Calio I had Calio you know it was one of
those things where maybe the funniest thing I could tell about Calio is when
Tangy came out and got popular and people were lining up to buy tons of
seeds from DNA and Angie hybrids a lot of us up here in Mendo were shocked
because you know five or ten years before yeah trying to give away pure
citrus smelling pounds was a tough sell yeah it was that was there was a there
was a limited limited market and you would get told no a lot headache we a
lot of the pure citrus stuff whether it was the lemon G or the Calio or the this
or that if it's just one note citrus turf a lot of people will get old on it
amazed when Tangy came out to such it was like citrus had gotten so unpopular
that it got a had a resurgence because no one had smoked it yeah because no one
none of the brokers would buy it yeah that's kind of how I looked at cheese
too but like when it started getting a big resurgence I was like but I did it
when I was down south I did get to grow out a lot of Caleb's Calio hybrids yeah
and you can really see its sativa origins yeah pop through and various and
various things especially if you cross it to other things that like to stretch
and you know I'm not exactly sure what it is but it's one of those original
clones that you know went over to Amsterdam and it sounds like it came
through Rob Clark no interesting you know he wrote about it he wrote about it
in the first can of Bible and that big that's right yeah no but it people get
over people get over it cuz it's just it's oranges yep yeah I'm not a fan um
spirit of 76 did you ever see that up there just in the can of Bible no yeah
yeah I see pinkleberry that looks pretty identical to it and that that super
specific pink pistol trait but that doesn't mean they're necessarily related
but that was what I always wanted to see and I was wondering if it passed around
NorCal back to the thing that I'll say about that and it has nothing to do with
the spirit of 76 but it's that growing a lot of the same strains over the years
indoor versus outdoor yeah there are strains that will give me magenta or hot
pink or crazy colored you know those hues pistols outdoor yeah but we'll
never ever do it inside yeah and they don't never I to that color yeah no but
there's a period of time during their flowering cycle where you can get I have
I mean I have a bunch of my phone you can get some really amazing different
stuff yeah but only in the Sun yeah it's weird yeah it is weird and maybe
it's I wonder I wonder if one day the LEDs will somehow be able to capture
that range that pushes it out indoors I'm always know that so someone just
asked a pretty good question when we said what does double up mean and what I
what I mean by that and just like a super quick genetics lesson and I'll use
humans as the because that's easier than plants is like having blue eyes green
eyes hazel eyes gray eyes that's recessive right yeah so the only way
your kids can get it is if both parents have the gene yes right if they don't
like for instance you know I have I have I have multiple kids I have hazel eyes
my wife has green eyes so we both have the gene we got two brown eyes and one
blue eyed kid yeah right and three tries so you know what I mean by double we
mean by doubling up is I think that that particular skunk aroma is probably
recessive now and you'd have to find a different parent that had that recessive
trait and grow enough of them that those two recessives met in one plant yep
lined up that's what we mean by doubling up because if you don't have two parents
with the blue eye gene you can't have a blue eyed kid yeah same thing with blonde
hair actually same thing with any number of traits they think that humans
eventually will all be some kind of brown eyed just because it's so dominant
in so many cultures that you know and I think that's kind of what what happened
to skunk it just got lost and now it'll pop out on rare cases mr. toad does not
have a strain that produces pink this inside mr. toes bullshit and let's see
we got the white from chrome uh you know you might remember more of the history
about it than I do I classify it in the same way as the snow and maybe some
other things one of those low terpene low flavor chunky frosty plants that
tend to transfer that when you breed yeah so it got mixed into a bunch of
stuff yeah it was the white because of how frosty it was yeah it was from from
chrome from swamp boys was the one that brought it online I don't remember where
he said he sourced it from somewhere in Florida I remember there was some talk
around the time to that it was called a white triangle or just triangle but not
triangle cush there were there was some speculation on that I don't know how I
hear it that is I wish we could have chrome on to talk about a little bit I
was associated with like in my head with the hash plant meaning that it's a plant
that is solely for producing hash or adding tons of resin but it also adds
earth and dirt and mushrooms turps so it might be one of those things like I
never used to talk about the nl5 yeah how it added frost and structure and
improved Lee Lee you know kale it's the leaf ratio yeah but it didn't taste like
much or smell like much which he liked because it let the other side of the
breeding shine through yes so it added and I that's kind of how I think of the
white yeah it did it did amazing with the blue bonnet and let the blue bonnet
dominate it which is really weird for like that recessive blue turp in the
first place so that blue smell and that's the one thing that I found that
really married with the white well in a single f1 hybrid usually it takes some
back crossing to to get rid of those turps to the white and that's kind of a
common old-school way of breeding where you take something that's frosty and
dense with nice structure and potent but maybe doesn't have a lot of smell or
flavor and you throw that on something while we're growing with better turps
and better this and better that you see if you can get both qualities in one
plant yeah you know so let's see it's fucking incredible not me yeah no I
threw it once and called it fucking awful but it was a seedling I actually
have to say let me let me add this in too is that someone just someone
mentioned that they think that the citrus turps took off with dabs and I do
think that tangy came out at the perfect time because a lot of that citrus weed is
pretty low potency to moderate at best yeah but if you make the HO of it and
you make it 78% THC you're gonna get high if you take a dab yep so in the
flower form years before it would just get it would just be weaker and wouldn't
stay around yeah but you could put it through BHO and that citrus turf would
come through whether it was lemon or orange or tangerine or whatever your
brain picked up on and it would work yeah so for it for it was perfect timing
for extracts yeah anyway black Russian I don't really have any experience black
Russian cherry a k blackberry beautiful beautiful magenta colors it was before
Chitrali was super popular so people weren't used to seeing those beautiful
magenta colors it's responsible for like double purple doja and Sputnik and a few
other things mostly just like the blackberry but with better cherry nicer
turps and a little bit more resinous than blackberry but still overall pretty
low potency and mids yeah low potency and mids yeah unfortunately I spent a
lot of time on black Russian a lot because I was convinced I could pull
something good out of it and I never was able to doesn't mean it can't be done I
was just not able to and I tried a lot we yeah I mean it was kind of this like
that blackberry kush that we had in Mendo was kind of the same yeah it was
incredible looking and people love to grow it and it would be absolutely
gorgeous and then sometime you just realize that you didn't really get very
high from from smoking it I'm some I've just seen the same thing up over and
over about 20 times Asian fantasy we're not talking about Asian fantasy only
because that was a clone that was supposedly never passed ever yeah and
that's it so there's no nobody has any experience with it except for Jason King
and the guy that wouldn't give it out there was scammers that claimed to have
it and traded it out for a long time they still claim to have it and it's
stupid yeah it's ridiculous it's one of those strains like I I don't know like
creepy people just make shit up just is what it is um West Coast dog do you
have experience with it I you know I wish we have we have some friends that
have more experience with it that are chatting on here than I do I never
really grew it it did seem like it was one of those big yielding you know that
they could pass as chem so it got grown in a lot of greenhouses and a lot of
outdoor yeah but I don't remember its origin story off the top of my head and
I'd acting thinking if you've ever smoked em or smoke smelled tan you'd be
like one it's a it's it's a bubble hybrid probably of some sort it does
real well outdoors because people could move it out is indoors it just was one
of those plants that could one of those transitory plants you could pass off as
and that's about it that's I mean the brokers there's always been a history
of brokers where if they could make depths look like ends or they could they
thought that outs looked like depths then they could get a higher price for
from their customers and then their margin would be bigger which is the
point of their existence yes yeah you know so it was like a big I don't know I
think it was one of those ones that it was like a big growing Afghan that was
kind of boring but yeah it got cam attached to it let's see what else we
got here purple mr. nice I know that went up in your area did you did you
grow any that yeah purple mr. nice is a little weird in the sense that it it's
got G3 it supposedly got g13 in it yeah you know and it's one of those things
that when when Neville lost when whenever went to jail for 11 months and
then since he got him out of spent since he gave him a bunch of money and
got him out of jail and bought his seed company some of the things that were
common in Neville seed catalog didn't poured over yeah to sensei like any of
the g13 hybrids any of the hash plant hybrids the maple leaf all disappeared
yeah and then in the late 90s after Neville left the maple leaf the g13 the
Afghani one all those things started popping back up yeah and I don't know
if they pulled them from seed but I think that's where it came from yeah is
mr. it's sensei offering first yeah right and it was a g13 by hash plant
yeah you know that's plan it'll one yeah yeah yeah it just it was like every
single g13 hash plant that was purple to me it was it was it was narcotic enough
it was okay you know it yielded really well and the better it yielded the worse
it was yeah it's about it yeah I mean so it's one of those things where I always
question is like why did it disappear the whole time Neville was there yeah
and then after he left got brought back like why didn't it state I've never
gotten answers to that why didn't the hash plants in the g13 and the maples
and some of those other things why did they go off the menu yeah and then 10
later pop off back on the menu yeah any mangoes that you can remember there's a
ginormous mango that old-school seed line that floats around Mendo because
people used to be able to get eight or ten pounds of plant off it yeah and they
called it the mango around here and then obviously there's the mango haze but I
don't know which one he's referring to yeah I'm not sure I'm just just mango
or in general mango marijuana you know I don't really I I've heard various tales
about that type of stuff you know it was supposedly grown a lot in Trinity County
you know and you know extremely potent I had a friend that used to move a lot of
it but I never had I never grew it yeah yeah I grew a bunch of the seed line
it was the name was a total to me it was a misnomer I tried tux I tried motor
rolls tried Sanny's which was motor rebels I didn't have anything I liked it
was very low potency some of it was resinous smelled like a leather which is
just not my my gig how about the puck the puck you know I we both have some
experience with the puck the puck is supposedly a hash plant you know from
Neville from the Neville seed bank era in the late 80s yeah it came out of you
know it got famous in Colorado and Leadville and various places like that
some old schoolers used to carry it around in a hockey puck hard case and that's kind of how it
got the name the puck and it's around and people breed with it I never had very much luck with it
because when I had it I was primarily using the Sun yeah and it grew worthless weed in the Sun
that was some worthless looking weed about either outdoor or greenhouse I've written like my head
stash beds which produced a whole bunch of gorgeous weed and that stuff was leafy took forever almost
resinous but you know inside people get better better results off it you know it's kind of
another one of those like old Afghans that's really ugly by today's standards yeah and probably is
best than a breeding project probably its best trait is that it's got very old genetics in it
yeah but it's not like a one hybrid and you're done no I you know I anybody working with it more
power to him for trying that's all I'll say on that it's probably a multi-stage process to get
what you want yeah and this is it for the list right now you got me on yours you got your no I
didn't write me down I just saw you had such a huge list yeah you know there's a Yumbolt I never
grew the Yumbolt but I actually used to strangely enough I used to get Yumbolt from Humboldt and
whoever had the Yumbolt and Humboldt was doing a good job and it was frosty and burned good and I
enjoyed smoking it yeah you know people are talking about you know yeah there's people out there that
are doing some extensive puck work and I think that's probably what it would take yeah yeah it
would it would take I'm not saying it's bad or I'm not dissing it I'm just saying that like to get
the qualities you want out of it you're gonna have to work with it for a while and do three four you
know five stages of breeding and you'll probably get it to somewhere where you want to go if I was
being optimistic I would say cross once to the puck and then cross to anything else for like
generations no I'm just kidding there's I'm sure people are doing great work with it I just haven't
run any and that's that's the main thing Island Sweet Skunk I could talk about that for a second
it it's Canadian there's stories around about it supposedly it was an L again don't fuck it up
again well then you say it so I won't I can't fuck it up well I don't remember so but you I
think it's cotton candy was a rename of ISS or something like that well no there's a sweet skunk
the sweet skunk was supposedly an nl5 Hayes maybe mixed with something from from breeder Steve and
then the Island Sweet Skunk you know was I don't know like it kind of got like fucked up with Mark
Emery and he decided to like rename something because he wanted something different sounding
on his menu so I don't know but apparently it still lives in Canada there's people that know
the real story and have an original one it's been held around for a long time and it's likely an nl5
Hayes or hybrid yeah Irene we're not going to talk about just because we might have some people on
eventually that it's kind of their story to tell and they can give an enormous amount of depth on
it yeah hopefully that'll be soon yeah yep Casey Jones is that it was a similar era there was a cut
from Joe Schmoe that was pretty good at Casey Jones that's about all I got on now if you also
want to cover before we wrap this one up and if we missed any again the send us messages some of
the ones people were mentioning you guys missed it earlier in the episode summer and other episodes
about so go check them out anything else you want to cover before I start doing a
bullshit we're about that time 850 or something like that yeah oh I'll see some somebody just
asked about champagne champagne was a Canadian strain and there was this picture I can't remember
if it was in the in Emory's magazine cannabis culture or whatever but there was the there was
these videos there was these pictures of champagne that were just like three foot tall colas with
very little branching on like a hydroponic setup and it just looked like there was like five pounds
of weed yeah on this table and it was very it was very delicious looking and I think there was some
really attractive pictures of champagne taken they got a lot of people's interest in it and it was
seed lines that was crossed into stuff it's kind of one of those things I don't know that we ever
saw the real one down in America I can't say but it definitely was passed around those 90s beaster
circles yeah you know yeah someone was talking about what was in it the king and champagne a
funny story about the king I almost popped the last of those seeds and then I agreed to do a
collab with why yeast and caught when he was with compound the seeds got given to his partner of
King and I never saw them again so you look at him I'm sure compound might have a king hybrid
somewhere and I think maybe there's a good chance like we have some Canadian friends and stuff yeah
you know I think it still survives up there yeah it could very well yeah it's mostly it's most the
history on it is mostly Canadian yeah and a lot of things people are asking about like the Canadian
stuff I'd love to talk about but I just don't have any experience with Canadian stuff other than what
we could buy from seed up there and it was still minimal you know yeah we had this we had this line
from my friends and call it we had the Hong Kong I don't know if that's what people are talking about
or they're I don't know different Kong but yeah we had this thing called the Hong Kong that still
exists in various hybrids so the Kong if I remember correctly had this reputation for being sold for
some ridiculous amount of money like $20,000 for a cut yeah and so assassin was not just
OG cuz so the sessions were all hybrids of OG we still have the number one in our circle number
three was a hercule hybrid and it is gone as far as I know yeah so we've been doing a lot of
updates to the podcasts we're on every single platform now that you can imagine for podcasting
