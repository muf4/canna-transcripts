It was like it was like I was connected with everything around me.
All of a sudden I just started questioning everything I'd ever been told.
You know by the time I got high that very first time when it started to hit
me. I'm like wow. I got high.
Love that music. So first we are going to talk about something that's been going
on in the market you've been paying close attention to which is what's going
to happen up to and post legalization as it pertains to other countries importing
cannabis to the United States. We wanted to talk about some of that. I know
a few years ago I started seeing a lot of big breeders start moving to
Columbia. That's when I first noticed it was about two or three years ago. There
was a almost a mass exodus of some of the breeders going down to Columbia and
a lot of people are trying to import American strains down to Columbia. I know
Breeder Steve was one of them down there too. Charlie Garcia. Those guys went down
to down to Columbia. Yeah. Mustafung told me about Charlie. In fact Charlie wrote
me too because he was so sad with all the things that had happened at Ace that
he decided to just go somewhere new and being Spanish he would fit down there
so well. Oh yeah. I bet he's digging it in Columbia and I bet they're digging him
probably treating him like a dignitary you know. Really. Yeah like royalty. I
would assume he's been around forever. He's done a lot you know and that would
be a huge fit down there. And he knows a lot of people so that when it comes time
to market you know he knows how to do that. Is Columbia I don't really
understand the Columbia market as much but is Columbia as controlled by
cartels as say Mexico is currently? I don't believe so. I think the government
has stepped in by legalizing and they they monitor everything. They I'm sure
there's money being passed around to see who gets what licenses because that
one article said that there's only there was how many I said that there's only
like 16 or 6 that were allowed to produce seeds. Yeah. But there was a lot
of licenses for growers. Yeah. 60 or 70. So only 10% roughly were allowed to
produce seeds. So they'll be producing their own down there and with someone
like Charlie or Breeder Steve they'll get the right genetics design you know
though. Yeah. And I'm sure that Charlie's searching in the back jungles and
corners to find as close to land races as he can. Oh I'm sure. I mean he'd be
one of those ideal people for Columbia I think because he understands different
types of not just strains but types of strains how they grow in certain
provinces and certain certain elevations. So I think he'd be excellent for that
like like finding a strain and he understands breeding. He understands
working a line acclimating it. So yeah he's a great person to be down there
doing it. I'm kind of shocked that there's so few people allowed to produce
seeds. I don't know that the US market has a cap on the number of seed
producers licenses and stuff. I think it's kind of late if there is going to
be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's tens of thousands. Yeah. There's so much. So could
they be so brilliant that they're realizing that the future for their
seeds would be if there are certain lines like Chiba or Santa Marta gold and
they can regulate and make sure that the six readers of seeds really have
that so that when they sell them it could be Thailand's done something
similar kind of as I understand it something similar with their heritage
strains with like the silk squirrel tail the tiger tail snake teeth there's a few
other kinds from Thailand they can sort of like heritage strains however they
put a lady in charge of it named I don't want to say a lady in charge of
all this stuff and it seems that she doesn't even understand that most of the
ties that were sold during the era were Laotians so she she's putting out like
this big thing where like almost reparations that American farmers owe
Thai people money for growing Thai strains and using them over the years
when in fact they're probably Laotian strains so her bringing this forward
will kind of probably point out that most Thai strains are Laotians and that
probably the ties or reparations to Laotians if she keeps pushing it that
direction because she just doesn't understand the culture she doesn't
understand the history of the strains but she's in charge of it and I think
it's it's disappointing because I feel like that happens a lot in corporate
Canada America obviously in Thailand is that you have corporate money coming in
and corporate money choosing who is the head the spearhead these these campaigns
and most of the time the people with the money and in corporations do not have
access to the people who have the knowledge or have been keeping this
clandestine stuff you know keeping track of it the archivist they just don't have
access to these people or even know so they wait to be approached by these
people who tell them I am that person and it almost I almost feel like they do
they have no way to check do checks and balances on if this person's full of it
or not and it's almost like to me it feels random on who they choose like
huh you're gonna be the lady you know like you're gonna be the guy to
represent it and I know a lot of Thai people or people in Thailand right now
that are super interested in land races and preservation are a little upset
about that because I mean now she's representing certain strains as their
heritage strains that may not even be they could be you know Dutch hybrids of
stuff and they will always be pushed as their heritage strain now because she
said so yeah it's fascinating the politics that go behind all this stuff
because you never really realize how much it's gonna affect potential future
written-down history so I found the article from April 12th of 2019 so we're
talking two years ago and it says there's a hundred and twenty six
companies in Colombia at that time that's two years ago but only 16 for
seeds Wow yeah hundred twenty six have been
cleared to grow and have huge but only 16 of those hundred twenty six were
qualified to produce seeds says these companies are allowed to register
genetics in batches of ten at a time and the phytosanitary tests will mandate
them to cultivate a test batch engages properties before can go to the market
or register the genetics several well-known land race strains will be
featured so they are gonna try to do that that heritage strain type thing
that's kind of cool yeah Santa Marta gold Chiba black hopefully whatever
they choose someone like Charlie to spearhead that that would be cool
someone that actually knows their their business or or got must have fun for
someone cool you know I know he's not there but it would be nice to consult
I'm pretty sure they'll need testers no yeah that's for sure yeah so what do we
know about what do we know about the political climate in in Colombia as far
as so we talked about a little bit about cartels in Mexico how does this how do
you think this interplays with moving the product from Colombia through Mexico
because it's gonna have to pass through Mexico to get to the US unless it's done
on airplanes right yeah I guess I guess I don't know why I would assume that
they can't do it on airplanes if it's legal though I'm still in like that
outlaw mindset I think I smuggled it 747 pack yeah yes like the way UPS will pack
certain carrier planes you know they own them and use them but that size sure and
then they'll be they'll be perfectly you know protected you know they'll keep
them oh I'm sure of them they may even back seal them I don't think a glass
bottle and like some of the boutique companies in Northern California but
they'll definitely they've learned their lessons over decades so and they may
have some that they ferment on purpose and help bring about changes in the
smoke qualities it'll it's I don't know when it'll be but once we're federally
legal I bet they'll have their lobbyists already waiting and already had their
plans made it may even right now and when it happens they'll rush in and
there'll be all these companies America fighting saying we need to have tariffs
we need to have tariffs and stop them so it'll be interesting Washington DC
battle you know it almost I mean it's kind of would be common sense that a lot
of these companies because we know a few years ago that a lot of people moved
down there and started doing this that they are in these what were once cartels
maybe or maybe what is backed by clandestine money in Colombia and and
Mexico they have way more money than a lot of the the corporations and it is
what I've been trying to tell people like a lot of the people that are in the
US right now a lot of the major companies let's for example schmuggles
something like that level of bigness and they may not have enough money at all to
be able to compete with the international market I mean that's just a
fact I mean we're not talking you know the hundreds of millions of millions of
dollars that we have in America to invest in some of these cannabis
companies you know billions and trillions of dollars being invested and
a lot of these people these companies that were started by actual growers
some cases getting investments from doctors lawyers chiropractors that money
is not gonna hold any weight when these guys come in it's they're gonna get
crushed there's no way it just by simple economics I mean the way it works is you
know if someone has X amount of space and it's 10 times the space that you
have and they can sell it for pennies on the dollar compared to what you can
afford to sell it at and they can afford to take a loss for 10 years there's no
way to compete that's just how all capitalist markets work in a new in a
new market where I guess you could say this is this is not a new commodity but
it's going to be considered a commodity in a broader sense for the for the world
term that people can invest in it's gonna be a commodity like pork bellies
or anything like that and and when those come into play it dumps out any mom-and-
pop chance of being able to never compete again if I was in charge of a
big cannabis operation in the United States I definitely have my
representatives in Colombia Thailand and tropical areas right now which I wouldn't
doubt if Spain has such a large presence down there from the people like Charlie
that are the growers then there's they have friends who own stores and companies
in their countries there's plenty of millionaires and there's quite a few
billionaires these days yeah why not you know it makes more sense in South
America I guess or Mexico or maybe even Thailand for the cartels that are doing
other things illegally cane and opium and then they make billions of dollars
and now they can put it into something legal it's like washing their money it's
like beautiful and money to retirement so how do you think Mexico is gonna
interplay in this whole transition I know you know I mean Mexico is a bit
behind Colombia as far as how people are set up there the politics are gonna be
much different I don't know how much different I don't know the level of
political corruption in Colombia but I'd imagine it's somewhere on in between
Mexico and the US as far as corruption in politics so I just wonder with with
the powers and the money that the cartels have in Mexico how they will how
they will be prepared to enter the market because with all that land in
Mexico and as cheap as land is in Mexico I mean it seems like that and the
climate are the determinant factors on where a person can grow cannabis
essentially on where these farms will start popping up around the world
Gustavo Petro is a former guerrilla fighter and he is now the president in
Colombia and that makes a big difference because he's going to he has a much
different view much more down-to-earth he's not like the high-end only money
person being yeah it says he is an economist politician but he was a former
guerrilla fighter and he's been in president since 2022 yeah Mexico has too
much corruption and murder yeah Colombia you in a kidnap capital of the world but
Mexico's far and above it now because I don't know it's just so split into so
many factions when you had only four big godfathers and godmothers in
Colombia or five it was very organized but Mexico if you look at all the
cartels yeah the maps that show like 25 different ones and they're they're
trying to combine and then others are fighting the others I I think Mexico
will lag far behind however it's so close to the United States that will
have a spillover beneficial effect for them just like think automobiles
everything was Ford and Chevy and then suddenly Toyota and all these other
countries I mean German okay Volkswagen was always here too and BMW yes but
suddenly when imports started flooding to the United States they came in with
some great quality and stole away a lot of the market and now they've been
playing catch-up for years Ford and Chevy yeah with electrifying it's going
to be interesting because Tesla kind of broke the ground but now there's
companies in China that make electric cars that are $7,000 yeah it's gonna be
hard to get you at that even if we tariff it 100% it could 14,000 for an
electric car just to use in your neighborhood and around shopping and
stuff yeah those will sell like crazy oh yeah yeah
affordable affordable electric yeah that'd be insane I mean you know it's
funny is you know I collect a lot of different things as I've talked about
and in the over the years I've watched the guitar market specifically and the
knockoffs that have come and how vast the turnaround time is on guitar knockoffs
now is literally it went from probably five or six years from a model being
released to where you were able to buy that model bootleg in China pretty
easily you know for 300 to $400 as opposed to 10,000 or 15,000 you know
really yeah oh yeah that much of a difference because they're doing like
they're doing like custom shop like like artist edition versions like perfect
replicas that you can get and sell for 500 bucks because they're doing it in
mass but they're doing it so good and now they're down to they're down to
about two months two months after each line is released for guitar maker if
it's a high-selling line they will have it knocked off in two months now as
opposed to six years there's no turnaround time whatsoever it's crazy
and I'd imagine it's like that with a lot of stuff China's able to reproduce
and produce on such a level and on such an affordable level that we couldn't
even begin to understand over there six cents a gram production price they're
predicting Colombia I think we're gonna see a replay in the weed market Mexico
could certainly compete in their more tropical areas like Oaxaca and Guerrero
because live in the mountains and they they grow their own beans and it's a
much simpler life like much of Colombia I'm gonna have some big cities though
and yeah a port on the Caribbean and a port on the Atlantic so they can ship
right from the Atlantic side right up to LA or San Diego or they can ship right
to Miami from you know Buena Ventura I think it is the one that's by Santa
Marta and it you know they could pick up a little Jamaican along the way you know
yeah right pick up some Jamaican along the way son. Do you ever see a country like China entering the
cannabis market based on culture and religious aspects? Not for a while.
Thailand and look at all of Southeast Asia you know Kalimantan and you know
the guys on the forums from Australia certain people you know Wally Duck and
Rocket Bong and a few bunch of others they've gotten strains from Sulawesi
Kalimantan and these are these are land races that aren't polluted yet there
aren't any Dutch citizens well hippies they yeah it's just more difficult of a
society to just go over there I know Rob Clark's been there and so has Shanti Baba
because they're both big fishermen yeah and they love to fish from the shore
type and Rob holds some records in New Zealand the annual things there that
they have so now yeah yeah world records I have photos I don't have his permission
to pop them up. If he'd let me there's some amazing stuff he sent me of him barely
holding a 50 kilogram fish in his arms oh my god looks like Papa Hemingway
he's got white hair now and white he's in his rubber clothes because he's on
the beach you know pulling these in and yeah he loves it that's his thing and
apparently Shanti Baba and he were thinking of maybe even getting a little
tiny resort in former Borneo Kalimantan yeah who knows Wow
Wow Borneo yeah right we're to some place where the people running it were
longtime friends that'd be really cool yeah I mean longtime friends and seed
nerds like stray nerds that you just sit there and nerd I mean yeah it'd be
amazing I wonder if it'll ever be the time that Americans can go to Columbia
and not get kidnapped or bothered because from you know someone from Spain
speaking perfect Castilian Spanish you know they're gonna fit right in but yeah
Americans are still viewed I believe in many of the countries like south of us
every everyone's gonna someone's gonna be willing to pay for you if I get
angry yeah maybe it's only 10 grand and not 10 million like if you were really
special but I don't know maybe it's only 400 you know but that's that's months of
someone's livelihood there and that's enough for them you know what I mean
yeah I'm trying to if I could get a special you know endorsement says do not
kidnap you know I was watching something the other day on it was a guy that went
to Pakistan and he was going there to go up through the Kunduz Valley basically
he was going from like the Khyber Pass over the Kunduz Valley and up through
Pakistan up through Nepal and everyone that he met along the way we're just the
most kind you know sweet people the the cultures they're absolutely insanely
sweet and like most of them he'd be saying like have you ever seen Taliban
out here they're like I've never seen a Taliban this is Pakistan we don't have
Taliban maybe down in Peshawar you know like in the big city but they're like
they've never been up here like so they they one thing that they were impressing
in this video the whole time the Pakistan people were impressing like
Americans are very welcome here we love Americans we love people from other
cultures and in a lot of these places he was going were Greek Greek descendants
from when Alexander the Great passed through yeah that ash trail area so a
lot of these yeah the Hunza Valley yeah or the Hunza people yeah and and that's
where this guy was staying with a lot was with the Hunza people and they just
seemed so nice and friendly just wonderful wonderful culture I have a
little booklet I got in the health food store in the early 70s on the whole
Hunza story and their diet they eat a lot of apricots which has a lot of
benefits and there they don't eat a lot of meat if they do it's probably goat
meat yeah they like to yak yeah yeah and Hunza Valley until maybe 10 years
ago was very difficult to get to you had to trek for days to get there now I know
there is a road that leads in there however the people are probably still
just as friendly they called it like the Garden of Eden like it was a paradise
hidden and these people lived in perfect harmony and whatever they have
different districts different little regional voting areas well not even
voting like people in charge that were voted in by their their tribe because
there were such good people so it was good good yeah it I know that the dude
who went there it was mostly because of the whole Shangri-La story like he was
trying to figure out like where where this was kind of considered or where it
was just going in that area and yeah I if I remember correctly it was either
the Hunza people or somewhere close to there where they were saying they are
not Muslim so they are looked at as second-hand citizens not really quite
they're not given proper representation in Parliament in Pakistan and stuff
like that because they're not a Muslim culture and yeah I thought that was
absolutely fascinating that this little tiny bastion of like free people exist
in their own little area in Pakistan and they're just so sweet they seem sweet
you know I've never been there but they seem sweet when I was thinking about the
Kogi people who were all white and they live in the Santa Martin Mountains
there's a beautiful movie that came out maybe 20 years ago and it's called
message to little brother I think was the name of it I researched this the
other day again and it's about an hour and a half long documentary and you
can't go into the Kogi highest villages they they have them blocked on these
paths up into the Andes you can get that far but they won't let you be on
that and they have right to because it's their land and they consider everyone
else in the world like us little brothers and they were this was an
environmental movie showing how they have noticed the snow is no longer on
top of Santa Marta there it's the weather is changing and and it's because
of little brother not knowing what he's doing and with nature and right next
door is Venezuela and there's parts of Venezuela and then going to Guyana that
are on almost unexplored and then I know that's the upper end of the Amazon which
is also very little unexplored and fortunately there's people helping the
tribes there maintain their lands and hold back the people who chopped down
the rainforest to make the palm oil plantations really it's amazing we live
in interesting times that's for sure I I look forward to seeing Santa Marta gold
coming in original it would be so cool or Oaxacan some strength of Oaxacan that
no one knew existed because the people there were guarding it became legal and
they were no longer criminals they had friends who were in the city who knew
how to bring it yeah it'll happen I still think that there's a good shot
that we have these Colombian golds and Oaxacans even in the in US seed
collections I'm sure you know even even with Rob Clark and and and others like
that you know Watson I'm sure they have these old stuff I mean Watson said a
million times that he has everything that he's ever touched in seat stored
frozen forever so you know I I hope that they do bring these back out and grow
them at point of origin type places you know like grow them go take it back to
Colombia grow it at point of origin bring some of this natural stuff back
that that has been wiped out that'd be cool
I have one 1977 Guerrero seed that a friend found in his desk it's not viable
and down the road with the advances in PCR and DNA and RNA it's very possible
they'll be able to deconstruct it just by breaking the seed and taking the
remnants of whatever's in there and the genetic code yeah and re-engineer it I
don't know if this is good I think it's very possible you know it's GMO you know
so it's very very very possible I mean it's it's not easy like it shouldn't
imply that it's easy but it's definitely very possible to take something that has
its genetic code and if they understand the genetic code and how to reinsert it
it'll take years to understand the DNA map of cannabis and what goes where and
why but it's at some point they should be able to have a would you call that
like a blank canvas type seed that they can inject this code into I definitely
think that's in there in our very near future and something like that will be
absolutely so important to have tissue culture yeah it's at a cutting edge
right now and the company that's really the most advances in Canada and they
recently opened in the United States I contacted them maybe a year two years
ago called them in Canada and they said at this point having a single seed like
that it isn't feasible but it's on its way and they feel very confident that
they will be able to take a seed like you said and somehow take what's left in
it and inject it into tissue culture and then grow it again and then cross it and
make new seeds of the exact same strain so hmm I think it's not too far out no I
don't think so at all Kerry Mullis is the cool guy he was a surfer too who
invented PCR basically and oh really and he died just a few years ago he wrote a
really cool book that I have and he did a lot of acid when he was in college and
he more or less saw the RNA helix or whatever on acid and that's what allowed
him to then make the final steps and make PCR real and he worked for a
company at the time so they got the got the patent for it he got the Nobel Prize
of chemistry that year by the way and his friend said you should just quit
your job and then do it on the outside and he estimated it would be worth this
is 20 years ago when you wrote this book I believe he said would have been worth
about a quarter billion dollars that I'm sure and today be worth probably 20
billion dollars you know because PCR is used in everything everything yeah
that's how it goes when you work for a company they own you and they own your
they own your soul all these books are nonfiction almost every single one I
have probably 40 50 fiction books but yeah and now with the internet I can
skip most of these books however they're still my friends right I can't
let go of this stuff like every move that I do is insane mostly because of my
book collection it's insane it's heavy there's so many boxes of books but and I
know a lot of these are online but like at the same time there's a lot that
aren't you know and that there's the ones I've been trying to scan in and get
out there for people because I really have this this fervid belief that like
in order for us all to progress and get at the level to where I wish people were
when it comes to breeding and cannabis breeding and taking it seriously we all
have to be have access to the same information to be on the same playing
field to have you know expectations of people to put in the work and to know
what's what so if I'm not making that available and I have the resources to
then I'm part of the problem that's the way I look at it's weird but yeah so I
mean I'm determined to get it all scanned I had 10 feet of National
Geographic's at one point because my grandfather gave me a subscription when
I was nine years old and for the next 15 years and then when he died a friend of
mine picked up where he left off and kept sending them to me but once it went
digital and I realized you can search every copy yeah for what I need in my
life I gave mine to the boys and girls clubs and it was 600 pounds
and I was so happy to give them away because they would use them to cut out
photos and yeah yeah lodges or do whatever they're doing in their class
and that was fine I didn't need the best but um now in high times that's a
different story I'm give those to the boys and girls club
definitely gonna hold on to those yeah you need to those are special I mean
share them with people like you and other friends yeah like since since high
times has put the whole archive online like I have several and but I still find
myself picking them up every time that I see them for whatever and I'm like man I
know I can just go access it online but there's something about having a hard
copy from the 70s being able to smell it and flip the pages and really there's
something about that that I'll never be able to walk away from smell of books
the feel of books also I underlined I'm not keeping a book so that it'll be
valuable later unless it's one of the ones I collected as first editions so I
index my books and I open the front page and it's got my index and this is just a
small one where I you know I wrote that many yes like page 91 is about shin
splints page it's about ligaments and yeah it's just that's what the beauty of
books you know I never I don't never I've never really taken notes in books
but I had a or notes on books period I always memorized what I could and I
when I was doing a lot of UFO research I ran into a guy that just blew my mind
because every single book he had a long list of everything he had ever read
about it and and he'd be like have you read this book no here here's my notes
and I'd be able to read it real fast I was like this is so useful if I would
have done this for every book that I've ever read I could be helping a lot of
people like cut real fast yeah so now I'm making a habit to do stuff like that
to make notes to you know well I think it's super important this is probably
the best book on it's called the rocks begin to speak and it's by Levan
Martineau and about petroglyphs yes and but this guy he was raised on his
background he's part Native American and he was raised and this is how I
index my books oh wow you know all all the pages that have things word order
clarity you know like yeah a lot of archaeologists thinks he's full of it
he's no longer alive however he was the first to start like he said rocks broke
the silence and I've used his techniques personally in even a magic cannon there's
lots of petroglyphs and yeah there's one that's very simple it's just a circle
with a dot in the middle of it and it means something there and you see this
on the rock and he said he walked around the boulder and on the backside there
was a spring Wow they had anyone in it didn't matter what language you spoke
they all spoke sign language or rock writing language yeah and it's it's
incredible I and if you go to other countries like Central America South
America Asia this petroglyphs or you know hieroglyphs all the list world it's
just wonderful to me I think it's amazing stuff like that to even be found
in the United States because the United States like when we think about our
history we think of it traditionally being you know 600 500 years old from
the European conquest but realistically like like you said magic there is a
beautiful I've never seen petroglyphs in person but I can imagine the energy the
the vibrations around stuff like that has got to be magical one of my
favorites that I've found I think I sent you a link to the NFTs I made because I
was searching when NFTs first came out a few years ago it was a big and I
searched open sea and rare bull and all these sites and no one had done anything
with with weed yeah I found one finally one photo of a of a flower some guy had
posted on open sea but yeah all kinds of stuff and wove them together and one of
my favorite most rare petroglyphs I've ever found with my first girl partner
Doug second actually showed men on horseback and it was early
congista doors because they have helmets and it's it's a fairly rare
thing to see there are a few in northern Arizona and Utah as well but this is not
in Madag canyon proper but five miles away on top of a mesa drops off into
another canyon my friend and I were hiking over to look over the edge and
see these other canyons we were considering other growth spots and we
found this and it's it's pretty stunning to see a horse shape and a guy
on it and he's got a helmet and this dates back to the first conquista doors
in the six time to them documenting seeing these guys come through or like
and trying to figure out what they were seeing in the 1500s and 16s because they
conquistadors went through Arizona all the way up to the Hobie reservation they
came also from Santa Fe which was their capital at the time and Mogollon was one
of the first Spanish governors so the Mogollon one Ignacio Flores Mogollon
no yeah yep he was it's for four years in 16 like 10 or something he was the
governor okay yeah you can see they're on horses clearly and they're human a
humanoid forms and they all have headdresses on and that the horse was
introduced as you know by conquistadors to North America yeah and they were
stolen many times I don't think they were traded that often because there's
too valuable in the early days but Native Americans got some and then the
Plains Indians I mean they were there's hundreds there's tens of thousands of
wild horses at one point you know just like there were millions in Buffalo and
they were the the main ones but to go over rough terrain in the West the
conquistadors you know they don't show up in many petroglyphs the books I know
and this one is beautiful yep it's almost like a freeze frame of one of
them talking like looking back and talking to one of his other people like
that they were you know what I mean like giving them or his hands up directing
there's three clear ones yeah marching faster and then below that at the back
left and looks like another human feature like he's on a horse perhaps to
her or he's falling off and then below it's difficult to see I have the larger
version that shows this whole boulder this section you're looking at here is
about two feet wide and well three feet wide and two feet tall this photo is but
each of those horses petroglyphs are about I'd say eight inches tall maybe
ten Wow yeah when we saw that we were like oh my gosh because you know they're
not this been documented in any petroglyph books this picture that I've
taken no and I've been wanting to go get with my friends at Coconino National
Forest I've known them for 40 years the archaeologists there there's a new head
archaeologist Peter Pellis was the previous archaeologist and he loved
petroglyphs too there's two huge sites outside of Sedona Honanki and Palatki
Palatki is open to the public Honanki is where tours go and they walk you
through and they describe stuff and Peter came down once and gave a three
hour class that I was fortunate enough to be a part of with three other people
and oh wow they went over what they were saying about stuff and then he told them
if they were full of shit or not and they were 90% totally wrong like saying
this this is the Shon's cave and he said well actually in the Sonawa which
means without water they that's the nickname ancient people of the Verde
Valley he said there was no no documented signs of shamanism at all but
they called this the shaman's cave because of the petroglyphs that were
associated with it so then he would go through and then say what was more
likely it was an excellent and I was I wasn't I had already been a grower 20
years before I met Peter and and he I shared some things with him but I never
took my petroglyph book I have all these and as photos which I've since
digitized as you can tell here yeah I was never ever and I've been to
newspaper not newspaper rock but this big one that's up near the hope you rez
and other areas this is fascinating one of the largest in northern Arizona is
called newspaper rock and it it was a site that was used for many years people
would add to it and add to it and it was like a newspaper they akin it to because
it had so much information that was obviously into the rock over many
decades not just one person sat down for two years
thank you graffiti this is this takes to do one of these figures this is called
this patina is called desert varnish and it appears on rocks as they get older
certain types this is volcanic rock and it gets this brown or blackish patina
and to peck into it it reveals the real color of the lighter rock underneath but
it takes hours and hours to do one of these you're using another rock in your
hand that's hard like maybe a piece of granite or something and maybe a point
so that you can peck the design you want so yes this might have represented more
than one person leaving their information over many years it's hard to
say I yeah I think the top three at least of the front two here were
probably simultaneous in one stretch maybe in a maybe they spend a week
doing this who knows you know I just think like the part that catches me is
is the guy in the middle with his hand up like direct like that because it's
like it's almost like obviously he was the boss whoever he was they were
portraying him as the boss he may have had a stick in his hand to whip the
horse with you know because they didn't have yeah hers so it may have been they
were portraying that he had something he was hitting the horse to make it go
faster I don't know true I don't know that the Spanish used either that would
be another interesting thing to study definitely something on his head oh yeah
and the guy up front here had these minute rival tribes in the plains
Indians they were lots of headdresses but that was this late 17s I think or
maybe mostly in the 1800s these are going back to 15s and 1600s when the
first horses came through in the Sonawa and the Mogollon people saw them yeah
through and they were just like what the heck are those yeah yeah they didn't
even know horses were right no no can you imagine a horse and there's humans
on top of them just riding them around wearing armor and helmets and because
they were worried about getting shot by arrows yeah how quickly though like the
plains Indians adapted to be able to earn a Native Americans were adapted to
be able to ride horses and became very proficient horsemen bareback too yeah
amazing it's just amazing how they adapted to that oh it helped them hunt
and made their life easier yeah I they call them dog soldiers to the people
that rode the early horses they were they were comparing horses to large what
is it we like to be around these petroglyphs did you get any like I know
it's it's kind of hard to quantify spiritual spirituality and feelings and
stuff but did you ever get any kind of spark of energy or any kind it's kind of
sounds so weird saying that but did you ever feel anything around these
petroglyphs of note yes but it's hard to quantify like you said sitting next to a
fire we made underground fire pits so that the flames wouldn't be visible
1,600 feet above us was a small pueblo the ruins of it just two foot walls but
the outlines created made about 20 rooms and how and down below the boulders
that next near the creek that had the some of these petroglyphs had outline of
that structure you know 16 rooms little squares so they they had some very
interesting communication and to feel is that next near the creek that had the
some of these petroglyphs had outline of that structure you know 16 rooms
little squares so they they had some very interesting communication and to
feel well to be growing weed in the middle of all that was very very
powerful if we had a farm where and just had 10 acres it'd be cool but being
surrounded by this and at night hearing a creek flowing by and bears smashing
through the bushes and stuff it's like the only thing that divides you from the
people who wrote those messages is time in like what a small barrier in some
ways and understanding and understanding yeah so I'd like to talk to you about
one thing and this is something that I feel like it like I talk about it a lot
but I'm younger so even in my generation it was almost a lost art
unless you were into maybe tattooing or even plumbing or part of a union job or
something like that which is apprenticeship learning a craft under
someone learning learning the the apprentice meant apprentice mentor role
where you snap to it do what you say you know because you're learning and and
how that applies in modern days and and how much of that is missing now in your
time when you wanted to learn to grow were there guys that you could
apprentice under how would you have found an apprentice in the 70s let's say
or 60s to learn to grow in 76 when my dealer friend from Tempe said let's grow
our own and I'm like sure I already had a green thumb as far as I worked on five
acres of garlic with some other hippies in Cottonwood Arizona and I love taking
care of plants in my yard vines anything that could make it pretty and beautiful
I planted a few trees already so I kind of knew soil culture a bit comfortable
to step in then yeah and yeah what I didn't know is anything about the needs
of cannabis as it grew and especially when to harvest it and how to manicure
it yeah how to dry it manicure so that was self-taught with my friend he had
never grown either and luckily we had the growers guides and later marijuana
botany and all these fantastic so I frequently say the word the written word
has always been my guide and my mentor I I would buy books and books and books on
everything and just read and get ideas and ways to do it I didn't apprentice as
a carpenter or plumber or anything like that today you know with the advent of
more artificial intelligence doing other things really if you can fix air
conditioners or heaters or plumbing or electricity or build things you're not
gonna have to worry until it's like George Jetson time and there are robots
that can walk around and do everything I don't know that that day is gonna come
but probably will I don't yeah maybe 50 years to an hour 30 years I don't know
they're creating robots to fight other humans which is stupid or other robots
but yeah you know being an apprentice to a great mentor would be fabulous I know
people who have gone to work in Colorado at big rose and learn the basics and
after a couple years they come home and they they've learned what they needed to
know to feel confident to do it themselves but so wait but jumping out
yeah like you mentioned if you're not invested in it and you haven't put 10 or
20 years in you you can always just quit like you mentioned and walk away whereas
someone who's spent a whole lot of years learning how to refinish furniture or
build furniture or anything I have a nephew who's learning about
furniture right now and he's refinishing it and starting from scratch but I don't
think he has a teacher other than maybe YouTube you know and that's that's a
legitimate method of learning now that wasn't there when we were you know doing
stuff oh yeah oh yeah I was gonna change out my headlights on my Tacoma because
they're 10 years old and they're they're fading and I've bought 3m cleaners to
put on you know and wipe the glass it's not even glass it's polycarbonate and it
works for a while and then it goes back to being bad yeah so I looked online at
a guy who shows how to replace them and there's like 10 different electrical
connections and if you could take a photo every time you got to a certain
spot you're gonna pull this one off and this take a photo and then when you pull
it out take a photo yeah I get to a dealer and paid them to do it took him
an hour and a half to put two new ones in it would have taken me two days oh my
and then I made a mistake and then have to troubleshoot which wire did I leave
off or put on the wrong one yeah no it wasn't so it cost $150 a light to have
them do it and it was worth every penny so I bet those guys who did that in an
hour and a half they apprenticed for many years yeah mechanics who can do
stuff like that I'm in awe of I never thought of it to that level no I changed my
roof first I ever did was change the starter in my Volkswagen van I did that
myself I felt very proud I bet I used to have a 66 bug and the idle pin would
always mess up so I learned that if I got duct tape and a pencil eraser and
put it on that idle pin that it would fix it every time that's about the most
auto mechanics I've ever done is the old eraser yeah you turned it on its head
and found a workaround which I did which I've seen some great mechanics back in
the days that could do the same thing and duct tape man bailing wire gotta
have bailing yeah so when you're off road and you hit that muffler and it's
hanging you can strap it back so there's also the idea and this this kind
of goes along with the idea of a mentorship apprenticeship and it's
becoming a part of a group for example when you become a part of a forum when
the forum days were around and big you know I remember my first time coming on
the forums and trying to figure out how first what am I what do I say without
looking stupid right how do I integrate into this group that I don't quite
understand some of these subcultures like I was a punk rock kid in my area
growing up I don't really relate to the deadhead community very much but that's
a lot of this community is the hippie community so I've got to learn to
integrate and communicate with people I've never really integrated with or
communicated with or understand their cultural subcultural level and we don't
really seem to have that anymore what we have our social media where you just
blast out whatever you know but back then you had to integrate yourself into
a group to gain access not even to gain access but to to learn from each other
and at that point you know to share then cuts were shared between the group
because you trusted each other you knew each other you know and it was over a
period of several years where a lot of these groups and friendships were formed
and bound and I talked to the guys today like in my in our patreon discord group
and I see how some guys try to assimilate you know and some don't it's
just it's very different than the forum era where you where you watch these
personalities kind of try to assimilate whereas now it's just like lots of
clashing personalities all falling on top of each other and nobody really
understanding assimilation into groups it's very fascinating you mean like I see
Mary good yeah exactly it's it's a bunch of personalities all screaming at each
other as opposed to like a group working together I see Mac had the great you
know SD's finest group that did pretty cool the San Diego's finest cuts on I see
Matt those guys did really good for a long time but there's so far and few
between I mean you have the land race groups on I see mag that all kind of
pulled together you know over time they have some good groups and yeah you know
had a huge following Tom Hill eventually got so fed up with all these people
hounding him and he he would just blast people he Tom was one of my early heroes
yeah the floor just cuz he didn't like it's not that he would just go off on
people that wasn't it it was that he would do it and he was right and he was
correct when he was saying it you know and he was a geneticist he got off with
the top of me if he and Rob Clark were sitting down or someone who really knew
genetics well he he would have no difficulty you know talking about
backcrossing and just all the different mathematical formulas involved so you
knew what how many would be this how many would be that way what gene
expressions would do that yeah I love that it's beyond me I can kind of grab
the concept if I'm growing a hybrid and I have ten of those come up and I look
at them I'll see differences in them I'm not sure I could scientifically say well
one quarter we're gonna be this cross you know and express these recessive
genes and yeah it's something else yeah yeah trying to have conversations with
him is is very humbling so on a breed of level you can go going back to the
apprenticeship imagine being an apprentice petroglyph artist in the
Native American days or someone who made projectile points whether they were
spear points for the paleo-indians 10,000 years ago to run up and kill
Buffalo or the archaic period that came next and they were at all points that
were look like large arrowheads and they would boost a spear thrower's spear and
then finally the bow and arrow showed up in the southwest and little tiny points
which are sometimes called bird points they had to be very tiny and sharp and
in lightweight because they're going to be shooting through the air on a stick
and if you put a big point on there with a little point that arrow would just go
yeah yeah so those to find and to find their ancient work on the ground when
you're hiking is mind-boggling to to know how long it would take to be an
apprentice and get skilled at making those when they had such a tough life to
live every day that they couldn't just take a whole day to make points unless
they were special and they were so good or maybe women they they believe that
there was great women point makers too because they didn't go hunting as much
yeah and they were taking care of the home front and they would have possible
time at least before the advent of people growing crops and corn yeah where
you had to be out you know taking care of the plants and stopping animals from
eating them Wow we've covered a lot of territory today like I love petroglyph
stuff dude like
it was like it was like I was connected with everything around me all of a sudden
I just started questioning everything I'd ever been told
you know by the time I got high that very first time when it started to hit
me I'm like wow I got high breeders syndicate update not only is our merch
store up at syndicate gear comm but all episodes will remain free but what we
need from you is interaction if you're watching the show for your first time
kick back and enjoy it if you like the show feel free to like it but if it's
your second viewing we ask a gentle person's agreement that you click the

sneaky YouTube algorithm leaving comments telling not so his voice lulls
you into a trance works as well we hope you take the time to do this we try to
put out the best possible shows for you we can and want to build this community
