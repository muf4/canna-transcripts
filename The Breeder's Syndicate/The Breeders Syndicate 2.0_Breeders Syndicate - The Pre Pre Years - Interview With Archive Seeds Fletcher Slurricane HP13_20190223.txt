sorry about that guys my internet connection gave out hopefully we can get
Fletch back on and when he has time he'll come talk about the pre 98 but
I'll wait a minute till people get back in fucking stupid thing fucked up
Instagram you suck you suck cock so yeah no yeah it's it's uh it sucks
Bakersfield Internet sucks ass so hopefully we get archive back and he
could talk about the pre 98 because he has he's a fucking wealth of info when
it comes to Bubba's and OG's and wealth of info for a lot of strains a lot of
the important strains in history and and yeah and if anybody starts trolling
Fletcher I'll boot you right the fuck away I don't want to deal with that
root brothers pure Thai face off root beer the root beer is really good root
beer is really good comment on auto flower genetics real quick they're
useful for for people learning to breed because you can see so many generations
really fast maybe apartment growers but I'm not a big grower of auto flowers
h2o I'm waiting for Fletcher archive seeds to join in and he can comment on
the pre 98 because he's uh I want to make sure everything that gets said
about it is accurate green crack yes that's in the Appalachia why would
someone troll did my whole career I've been one of the biggest trolled people
ever you're gonna pop any of skunk techs gear without a doubt me and skunk tech
are doing a lot together so so keep watching Fletcher did not do green crack
Fletcher did dose Edos and many other strains moonbow fucking he's done great
work with the faith there's so many so many I have I have a stand I bought to
hold the phone up it but other than that you're just gonna be fucking your
arms gonna be tired if you don't have one of these things one eye what's up
brother I always get questions about dog walker I'm gonna have you come on with
me at one point we could talk about your dog walker because I think that's the
one people want to know about my dog walker didn't even sell that well so I
think most people are referring to your dog walker which I feel is superior to
mine whenever you're ready Fletch the real deal face-off story again Fletcher
is a guy for that he was there you still have any silver pearl I have silver pearl
weed of Bryn's only one smoking it right now so crack Walker crack Walker's great
I love it but a lot of people were buying dog Walker wanted more chem dog
type phenos and I use West Coast dog which is not even a chem dog you know so
yeah you want the GMO root beer but there's some there's the root beer
granola funk that that one's my favorite I haven't tried the the root beer GMO
but the root beer granola funk is my one of my favorite things I've been smoking
lately but when people talk about dog Walker og that guy right there when I
wreck that's the man that's the man behind the magic much respect to my
brother Madagascar vanilla bean yeah that one West Coast dog Madagascar
vanilla bean kind of for Madagascar what else you got what are my preferred ogs
triangle lupus headband which is probably an og hybrid but it's still
very good I love the Tokyo and and and Josh D's cut dragons blood from buddy I
think it's from the blood sativa Hawaiian blood sativa but that's that's
about all I know about the dragons blood is that root beer by mean gene yes it is
that is mean genes root beer it's pretty fucking rad gene did an amazing job on
that line man it passes over black licorice aniseed turds it's amazing
there you go hetero see all that anger now it's on its way yeah I'll leave us
up to watch if Fletcher comes on is that a Daniel Cormier avatar the 92 og that
is floating around is different from the Josh D cut that I have and the Josh D
cut I have came from resident long who was a part of that grow with be real so
yeah there we go bringing it mr. Fletcher so all your questions get ready
to drop them hey what's going on you finally find a place to put it I'm kind
of I'm trying hold on a sec you look handsome as ever dude any I'm not I'm
not very well set up for this social media shit yeah so pre 98 Bubba is that
what people yeah so in like oh four oh five I was on cannabis world and I got
the green Bubba the purple Bubba both from Ken organ kid and then I had a
Shabud who is 707 seed bank his Bubba Kush cut they were all called Bubba Ken
called the purple Fino which was supposedly an s1 that some club owner in
the in the valley made it was really heavy yielding made like club type
nuggets with the rounded top yeah the katsu cut I as far as I know and I can't
remember specifically but I'm pretty sure that was the cut that he sold to
katsu right and that was the green Fino and then Shabud aka 707 seed bank his
Bubba cut was the pre 98 and so basically what happened is I had all
three cuts I need to label them in my room so that I would could tell the
different or you know so I could maintain mother and know which one's
which and it just got the name pre 98 because Shaw had received the cutting in
the in the winter of 97 98 so at the time it's like 2003 I'm like what had to
have been before 1998 because someone popped the seeds and has a clone by now
already pre 98 right that's how I got the name and that was like 2004 and then
it was like three or four years later that's were basically appropriated the
name for selling seeds yeah so that's pretty much all there is to it it wasn't
anything special it wasn't there weren't anything crazy about it what was the
difference between Shaw's and like the katsu they all pretty much smell the
same the purple was like a little bit more purple smelling but still the Bubba
with the incense and the like the smell in the air the same meaty smell the katsu
they would all turn purple depending on how you grew them right so they're all
phenotypically variable based on environment it was the green Fino was
the katsu which it just tended to be green more often but if you over
fert it didn't budget very big whatever it put out little tiny buds it turned
purple at the end of flower with cold temperatures no not a major difference
the pre 98 tended to be a little chunkier more often but still the same
characteristics as the other two cuts it was still like basically what I call
like big stem small bud yeah I did right where you've given it too much cow mag
or it doesn't have a big enough root system for the size of pot it's in
whatever right if you bet it look just like most bubbles if you bet you're not
really big they'll start actually producing pretty good that's fucking
awesome dude that was a lot of shit I didn't even know about Bubba glad you
said that people were asking about the face off story that would be fucking
awesome to hear like straight from the mouth so the real OG Cushman the source
genetics Chris Chris used to live up here in Seattle in 2000 and I think he
lived up here from like oh two to oh six I met him in like oh four and he was
growing the poison og at the time which was his bad seed Fino from bags that he
had purchased in SoCal the face off was another he had 12 seeds of face off bag
seeds the face off was never actually a clone that was being grown it was just a
moniker given to a certain batch of og that went through the Inland Empire back
in like 99 or something like that I got six of the seeds I think four or five of
them popped if I remember right the face off number four is the cutting that I
have right I popped it from seed so that's the only real face off really I
mean I think there's like four or five more seeds out there Chris gave some to
cult classic seeds but I don't think he ever popped them and I'd be surprised if
they even popped now being 20 years old no and I think Chris might have a couple
more seeds of it but that's about it that's pretty awesome so like so I I
popped the seeds it was the number four Fino the number one two and three the
number one was like it like the leaves turned purple it had more of like a
in-between Bubba and and face off kind of smell yeah the number two was like
this really short sativa leaf looking thing but it didn't stretch it all it
was almost like a dwarf plant but it had a really really thin blades yeah the
number three produced like much larger bigger colas was a little bit Herme which
was one of the main reasons I didn't keep it and it pretty much smelled like
your typical og made with like a little bit of a gummy bear funk oh wow and then
number four and that the number three and the number one kind of had that
similar like gummy bear in between og and Bubba kind of smell the number three
was more og Dom the number one was like it wasn't really Bubba Dom I would say
but it was just kind of I would call it blander but you know it wasn't anything
particularly special and then the number four was the it's that it's that faceoff
smell like that really long lasting lingering after flavor and real cushy
flavor and the main reason I kept it too was its potency it's always potent like
the first time I was smoking it I rolled up a joint was driving to town and pick
up some hydro gear this is like 2006 and I smoked it I started getting like
lightheaded in the car and I was like all right this thing's pretty potent
probably and anybody that knows me knows I smoke a lot of herbs so I
typically don't even comment on potency at all because I'm smoking 20 or 50
different strains yeah a day you know between all the different kinds of
hashes and whatever else so that's fascinating dude I'm sure people
appreciated hearing all that now I have a question something I'm interested in
that I don't know a lot about other than probably Jason King's cannibal dude the
purple indica yeah it told me it's the one clone that I don't know that I don't
want yeah it's um it's super hard to work with I mean it's um it's a really
old strain from up here in the northwest everybody that like if you're around in
the late 80s 90s and 2000 early 2000s smoking weed up here you bought purple
weed and it smelled like the purple indica it's like this really really not
well it's not I mean it's pungent but it's like if you could think of what the
purple what purple smells like the color this is everything that purple smells
like and hold on a second I'm gonna take a token that and I got the cut in 2003
it was the very first cut that I got basically that it didn't come with a
name either so I got it from my friend who had gotten a medical card at the
time which was pretty hard to get and he had gotten the cut from some organ
growers I had no idea what it was I was growing some 97 Dutch passion blueberry
seeds at the time and I also had some some other blueberry seeds I can't
remember what they were I think they're from Canada one of the Canadian blueberry
crock like yeah one of those you know I can't think of the company names but you
know shit out of cannabis culture magazine not like a BCC Depot but like
Federation seeds all those guys I can't remember who it was that had like the
blueberry the blueberry nl5 all that kind of stuff I remember but else do you
ever try peak seeds I do remember peak but I think this was before peak I think
this was a god I can't remember the name but I'll come to me a second but
basically I was growing blueberry the time and when when you cut up clones of
the purple indica it literally smells like berries kind of right out of very
berryish smell right from beginning which is kind of that purple smell too
and so I would I didn't know what it was right I just I just knew that like it
kind of look like the blueberry shit so I kind of like was calling a blueberry
for a second I hadn't even flowered it yet so I didn't even know I was just
like I don't know blueberry something or other by the time I finished the cut I
knew that it was one of the purple strains from up here so we had the UW
perp Seattle perps Tacoma perps ultraviolet these were all basically the
same phenose or not the same phenose they were either variations of the same
variety or hybrids of the same variety right which is basically the old purple
from up here and it was like pretty widespread and we knew that there was
multiple different cuts because you could um you could basically like when
you bought pounds of it you'd get some bags that all smell like the purple
indica or like ultraviolet or whatever but if you got the perps like from
Tacoma it have like big 20 gram colas in it right and whenever you grew like or
whenever you saw like ultraviolet nuggets they didn't never have big
nuggets and it was always small little ounce bags of shit yeah and when I grew
out the the blueberry or the unknown cut yeah basically I start I grew it a few
times and I was like there's no way that this is the Tacoma perp cutting I don't
know if it's the ultraviolet I don't know if it's the UW perp I don't really
know what cut it is because I don't have anything to reference it by in terms of
other cuts so I called it purple indica yeah that was how I got its name right
so it became PI right and basically you know there never really was a purple
indica up here as far as I know it was just the perps so and it's just a
really really tight it's not tiny it's not like a dwarf or anything but it's a
very tight internode yeah Afghani plant pretty much anybody I know that's twice
my age that's up here in Washington they immediately can identify it as the old
perp from up here kindness cannabis he's one of my buddies from back in the day
he remembers it really well too and that's what the PI was and it's it's
lower potency you know 15 to 18 percent and pretty much whatever you cross it to
it reduces its potency so fucking plant though yeah it's just hard to work with
from from the perspective of trying to it trying to bring a new variety up to
modern-day standards it's you know it's sometimes you cross stuff in and it like
like cookies for example you cross it into stuff that makes it really frosty
purple which is what the market likes yeah you cross the PI and it makes it
less frosty dark purple and not quite as potent but the funny thing is the
potency is um is so subjective yeah nowadays that like back then the purple
indica we always called it shut up weed because anybody you load a bomb toke or
whatever for they immediately just sit there and zone out so even though it
always tested significantly was lower potency than a lot of stuff it um it
definitely would ring some people's bells sure that makes sense dude you
know I've noticed a lot of these lower potency strains are coming around more
now since concentrates are much more in use and available it seems like they've
gotten a renewed life in them yeah a little bit but I mean you know lower
potency means lower yields yeah as well right so I think a lot of people are
just trying to get as much bang for their buck especially from an economic
perspective oh sure sure so what are you working on now I think that's what a lot
of people like to know about you what are you working on now so they fucking
amazing shit do-si-do that's yours it's hard to top do-si-do I mean it's you
know it's it's all personal preference I mean I'm actually gonna pop all my old
seeds all everything from 10 or 15 years ago this next round right now I'm
remaking all the stock right of stuff that's already I've already gone through
and then I'm just gonna I'm gonna go back to the drawing board I'm tired of
the shit I'm working on I can't wait to fucking see what you pull up from your
collection I can't even imagine yeah I mean shit gets boring you know to me
yeah and that's why people are like oh someone else made your shit before you
could it's like dude I was working on trying to find something new not
remaking shit just because people are asking for it so it's all personal
preference you know and what your motivation is and it's all about I mean
anybody can make your shit before you if they don't test it and release it right
like yeah of course exactly if you're not gonna work it at all I mean you can
make it as fast as someone can sell it yeah basically yeah so you know do-si-do
took a while to make and remake because it's the OG KB is like a type 4 Hermes
that thing Hermes every which way you can possibly get so hybridizing into it
you've got it at least search through the population and look for lower
instances of those traits yep in any way that's not or he doesn't even know about
that obviously doesn't even probably grow their own fucking seeds so yeah
everybody's gonna be fucking bombing you about slurking you hear the story it's
up to you if you want to tell I mean dude I saw I can't make purple punch
cross with do-si-do to I don't get it especially if it's a half your line in
the thing right well I mean yeah exactly and it's like well you know if if people
are mad about the name or whatever the the funniest shit is they're the ones
complaining about patents on plants but want trademark rights for naming shit
yeah it's you know you can't you can't have your cake and eat it too you got to
be one or the other because that's how patents and trademarks work it's not
it's I mean you know I think hypocrisy is the the a lot of people's motive so
whatever it's fine I mean miseducation leads to it and it's it's alright it's
what the world is nowadays yeah that's very true what else you guys got for
him any other questions that are fucking you got him sitting here don't ask
fucking lame-ass shit yeah who wants to talk about purple punch anyways like
seriously let's talk about some fucking historical shit let's talk you know what
yeah HP 13 the most common misinformation about it is that it's G
13 hash plan I think most people think that because they're fucking retards and
haven't looked up anything can you tell us about your experience with HP 13 it's
not something many people talk about so I I got the cut I think from Caleb I
think he was the one that got it first but I had seen it earlier for example
like in you're talking about Jason King's cannibal earlier so the can of
Bible entry that was my herb the Trinity crossed with you dub that was herb that
I'd purchased that I showed this to Jason King at the 2002 Seattle hemp fest
the dog shit that's in there that was us not the humble outdoor pictures but the
pictures of the indoor that was my buddy cannabis Reverend yeah through another
glassblower friend of ours that grew it that was the dog shit entry that was in
there the purple indica entry that was mine and then Scott reach also reached
out to Jason King and I think showed him pictures of it but that cut came from me
I gave Scott that back in the day and so the first time I saw HP 13 was in 2004 I
went to stay with a friend of mine in Hana right and he's he was a dude
another dude that was on cannabis world and he he invited me to come out to this
party right now I won't tell too much about the party even though they don't
throw it anymore but it was basically a weed gathering party another another
couple buddies of mine that currently live on Maui and it was basically it was
deep in the fucking jungle it was off grid so there's there's no I mean they
had power because it's like a multi millionaires home that was this thing
getting thrown at so they had refrigerators and all the nines but was
actually an off-grid home and you know they had like kava leaf blunts and
fucking homemade kombucha and like homemade beer and all kinds of shit and
Jason King also happened to be there that was the first time I saw Mendo
perps also that was like 2004 I believe 2004 and so HP 13 I'd heard about it
everybody had talked about it I saw some jungle grown HP 13 that was grown deep
in the jungle there and I thought it was swag it was like but it was just poorly
grown I thought it had a really unique smell but it had like no stickiness to
the resin the smell I had to really mash it up because it was that outdoor
shit yeah and but you could tell it had like a unique smell to it and then I
eventually got the cut from CSI Humboldt and I think that was probably around
2007 or 8 was the first time I got it from him and it's it was like it's a
weird plant you know it's um it's pretty leafy very columnar growth just like
goes straight up didn't branch very much small yield and definitely hermion
on the bottoms and that's where like the P or the fuck what do they call it the
the sour P which is a sour diesel HP 13 cross that was all the same group of
cats that did this Maui party every year back then and I still have some friends
from those parties that that live all over and you know they remember the
stuff whether the one of the most impressive examples that I remembered
was the Jasmine Jack which came out of Eugene and that was it was real hazy
smelling but at the time like in Seattle hazy stuff was like where it was at
that's why the dog shit the Malawi Northern Lights haze that I made the NL
haze f2s the pure Malawi gold that we had the super bill all that shit was
super that was like what was popular like I remember when I first got OG up
here from Chris nobody even gave a fuck people were like dude whatever that's
just some indica bullshit whatever yeah right they didn't even care couldn't get
get anything more for it nobody really even it was it was pointless yeah I just
was growing it because I liked it right it wasn't you know like an o3 o4 o5 og
wasn't really that popular or known outside of Los Angeles yeah that's so
dude I can't ever get anybody knowledgeable to compact or comment on
HP 13 and it seems like everybody who grows it or has grown it has different
opinions on whether it's worth keeping whether it's worth growing but that's
pretty fascinating dude and I appreciate that yeah the the people that I know it
came from the people that Jason King saw it from originally the people that put
it in the can of Bible those dudes were from New York it's from New York right
it is from New York then for sure that's my understanding like I the the farthest
back that I have any experience with it and the people that it came from they
had a New York connection and that's where that cut came from Wow okay cool
yeah I've always wondered cuz you always see it in New York and Maui New York and
yeah that's why they had the sour D out there too right at the same time that
was all the same group of people and you know the scene was really small 15
20 years ago especially genetic scene back then because most people all they
gave a shit about was just finding one good cut and running it till the wheels
fall off yeah that was like the deal no one it didn't really matter what the
strain name was in those days cuz everything sold for great money oh sure
sure I've seen him fucking growing in Maui growing fucking plants and trees
and shit it's fucking gnarly out there yeah that that was how that HP 13 that I
first saw was grown and it was garbage on this like it was pretty much garbage
I mean that's I would be nice about it but it dudes lines trying shit in the
jungle is impossible yeah exactly like I remember I would ship out a jar weed
like I shipped out a jar of Albert Walker for that party in 2004 and
literally as soon as I opened that jar my buddy's house that we've got wet yeah
you know it was like cured perfectly and was like spongy with the with the
crack as soon as you open the jars it turns into like jungle weed yeah just
that humidity yeah the human it's like 98% humidity or 100% humidity it's like
raining basically so as soon as you open the jar just takes it it takes it all on
fucking a are you doing any more dog shit work someone wants to know um I'm
not doing any more DS work it's just not popular enough it's longer flowering I'll
play with it every once in a while it's actually hard to hybridize I saw rich in
here earlier also talking about his dog Walker and the scooby snacks shit that
people like to make a big deal out of yeah and like every rich and I have
mutual friends I didn't do it as any intentional thing I was living in LA at
the time had no idea that there was I don't even know this was 2012 so I don't
even know if rich had made it or soul or giving it to people or whatever yeah but
literally I just made cookies crossed with fucking cookies crossed the face on
I called it snooze to scooby snacks and honestly it didn't even really sell very
well and I didn't expect I had no idea until I moved back up to to Seattle and
then started working with my buddy in Oregon did I even know that there was a
cut out there called snooby sacks so I mean is that what the dog Walker pets
called scooby snacks no dog scooby snacks is dog Walker and forum cookies is my
right I didn't know that either yeah yeah I mean I'm you know for it just
still in here I'm sure he can uh he can tell everybody but yeah the dog Walker
which is our Walker og I'm not I'm not sure who made that side of it and then
that hybridized with chem 91 or chem 4 I can't remember if rich found out which
one it is I think you ended up saying chem 4 is what he was told yeah yeah so
I think it was supposed to be chem 91 ended up being chem 4 I personally
prefer the flavor of chem 4 so yeah it makes even more sense why I like smoking
dog Walker here's my favorite question are you going to breed any more land
races I mean why are you gonna like it a land race yeah I mean why would I even
try I'm gonna move to Antarctica and make the first Antarctic land race there
you go yeah what else you guys got you tired yet Fletch you good well I mean if
this means I have to stop trying to answer this shit with my fingers that
would be helpful I mean I've tried so for you know this Matt I've tried for so
many years to try to just keep the information correct and it's just every
year there's another guy that heard something about the ocean groan story
from fucking paradise seeds mob John the biggest fucking scammer ever which Ken
organ kid could come on here and tell everybody about that's the same fucking
dude dude that's yeah that's him right exactly it's all him every story he ever
told was a lie I got so many stories about that guy because he lived in
Portland and I fucking knew him personally oh do you know him yeah I
knew him in real life yeah Wendy I want to say man that dude would like I don't
even know if he had a wife really you know it was a chick on meth that used to
fucking smoke meth with him that's what I know dude he used to have like like
stripper hooker whores and shit around all the time like he had a whole that
dude it was a problem you know I made him cry once but he was he was how I
ended up meeting Ken though right I believe that yeah because he was selling
Ken seeds at the time right yeah I believe that's West Coast dog was that
a John creation no that came from Ken also yeah West Coast dog so so John used
to basically find medical patients they get them to make seats for that seats
for him he'd take the seeds and not pay him anything oh shit yeah so he had a
couple buddies that were down here in I do know Ken who are not Ken Westfall
that's not who we're talking about but Ken Ken Doe who's the guy that's posting
there he's also in our circle of friends but not the huh is your friend Kendo yeah
I know Kendo yeah he's old school too but this this someone's asking if it's
Kendo that I'm talking about the answer is no this is totally different shit yeah
and so John used to get these guys one of the dudes name was diamond who's the guy
that's responsible for the UW cut yeah that's on the lawn line it's not you dub
first first of all that's good there you go it's it was a nice hash plant but it
had no smell of any UW I ever bought buying pounds out of UW there's many
different strains that came out you dub but none of them I ever saw was that one so there's
diamond in his buddy Jim right and Ken Ken remembers all these guys too and so Ken gave
those do the cuts and I got those cuts from them and that was like the sour OG the ogres
the cutting that ended up being called the smelly at all that shit I want to know personally
about who named banana OG it was a cut of OG right or ogres Ken named all that Ken named
and selected all that okay he he had gotten Sagar Martha's 6040 seeds as freebies with
shit that he had ordered from gypsy Nirvana gotcha and he liked that and crossed it into
the OG and that's banana OG it was a freebie packs from gypsy it was just bulk like basically
skunk number one hybrids because that's what I mean I think Sam the skunk man was selling
like millions of skunk one hybrids back in those days to all the seed distributor guys
and they would all just like package it up and sell it give it away as freebies or whatever
it was you know and yeah it was just that you know it was that cross with ogres and
then Ken grew it so it was probably one of Sam's skunk one hybrids as the 64 do you think
based on the smell and and like the way the plant grows the fact that it washes well all that stuff
um leads me to believe that it's probably um probably some skunk number one cross just like
pretty much everything else that I've grown from that era from Amsterdam our buddy Nick Vitus is
asking about um NorCal cat piss that's a Shawbud one right yeah that's Shawbuds a high school weed
from the early 90s that's fucking um and then the SoCal the SoCal cat piss is a cut that I got from
uh this dude that used to go by the name Philly he used to run a lot of weight up here um there's
a lot of local people up in Seattle that will know who I'm talking about if they were around back then
and he brought me uh those I did a bunch of work for him um and uh I actually heard that he's he
um was at the glass show like uh last year down in Vegas um it was like a random connection I
might be actually have his phone number I meant to hit him up but uh you know I haven't I haven't
talked to the guy in a long time and he had some uh he had some issues let's just put it that way
with the uh with the law so I you know and I was really I was always really paranoid so um
uh so you know but but him and I Philly and I have some funny stories just like of shit that
shit that happened like I borrowed money from him to uh get started in my first uh spot yeah when I
bought my own first I had those omega gardens that spin around the bulb and shit yeah yeah
yeah so I had borrowed some money from him to get going on that right and I ended up with like three
of those things that's awesome yeah but so anyways I did like some work for them and move some stuff
and did whatever and uh they brought me a couple big mother plants straight from San Diego of that
cut right and I remember just like cutting up like three there was two I never I've still this day
probably haven't seen plants this healthy um they were just like six inch rock wall blocks with mats
of roots that were like three feet long right yeah like they were doing that um where you cover
with panda film over top of the uh the tray yeah it was just like perfect white roots these things
that just you know been in the back seat and I probably took like 350 cuts off of Jesus those
two plants you know they were like covered in clones and anybody that's growing that San Diego
cut um yeah uh we'll know how branchy that thing is I mean it puts off cuts like crazy um so uh
anyways that's how I got that cut that's a legendary strain in San Diego along with the
Hans Rett P91 and the Bull Rider do you ever come across the original Bull Rider
I never saw any of those other ones man I only ever saw the cat piss right yeah and it was like
oh four that I got the cat piss from Philly yeah and Cannabis Reverend the guy the my dog
shit buddy and our other buddy um I don't know if he wants to be called so I'll ask him in the
future if he wants everybody to know who brought our brought our crew the dog shit um but there's
also the uh the the farthest back that I know that the um dog shit goes is my buddy down in Portland
uh um that owns five zero trees right they got it in 94 and supposedly it came from like Michigan
I think Michigan or Mississippi and it was originally called Electric Boogaloo or something
like that electric boogaloo that's right yeah that's um that's a story that my buddy that owns
five zero trees uh that those group of stores down in Portland they were the first ones that uh
that got that cut that that I know of and that's where that's where they say it came from
and uh your thoughts on Trinity I only ever bought the herb from uh from Eugene I didn't
ever see like the um I didn't ever see the cut or know anybody that had the cut directly
all I remember about it was really was that it had like a I saw a couple different phenos of it
so who knows what the fuck I actually saw right uh but all of them were like very burnt rubber
smelling um they weren't like skunk they were like burnt rubber okay um like that burnt rubber
cushy afghani smell um I don't remember them tasting it it was really well grown but
I don't remember it tasting um better than uh than it smelled I remember being the opposite
it's smelling really good and not really having a ton of flavor the the Trinity cut that I've been
smoking that uh came through like that not so dog and those guys have and Caleb that one that
one kind of tasted to me like the old Elvis cut which is real interesting I'm not sure if it is
the old Trinity or not but I they're saying it is yeah I haven't I haven't seen it so I really don't
know um the uh like I said the Trinity that I remember all of them smelled like straight burnt
rubber afghani funk and it was pretty strong smelling but there was no sweetness at all to it
there was no fruitiness there was no like off smell it was just basically burnt rubber I think
if people confuse that anything that's not sweet but that's funky with skunk uh I've been seeing
that a lot lately anything it's not fruity they call skunk but there's I think it also has to do
with like I know when I've stopped smoking for periods of months and stuff everything smells way
skunkier yeah yeah like OG smells like skunk Ken's sour kush that thing was fucking super skunky I
mean like if you think GMO has that bad breath whatever smell ask ask ask about the original
sour kush cut that um organ kid Ken put out there that thing was fucking ridiculous right I mean
comparatively it shits on GMO in terms of that raw halitosis OG funk right yeah that's which is
totally different than the burnt rubber I don't know I mean it is it's just experience I think
you have to have seen it to know the difference absolutely yeah I think that's everything
let's see we got blue dot
707 seed bank he knows more about that than anybody I mean that was like a club cut that used
to go through the third floor in Oakland that's all I remember about it um I've seen some blue
dot over the years but whether or not it was like um the blue dot that everybody talks about I have
no clue right the one that I saw wasn't that impressive so it leads me to believe that either
people are smoking bam or weed or I got the wrong I saw the wrong shit you never know
yeah well I mean I've been fooled before so yeah I think all of us have at some point
you got yeah where someone said something's really awesome and then you see it and you're
just kind of like oh never mind yeah uh let's see what else you guys got the Maui Pog you familiar
with it I don't know anything about the Pog yeah it's a HP 13 I want to say the there would have
been the Maui dog or whatever it is that's all I know about yeah I mean I've heard like a bunch
of different stuff but I've never really seen enough um about it the Oregon pineapple someone
said um I don't remember a whole lot I just remember buying that herb um I remember seeing
the pineapple ds I remember it reminding me of the Hawaiian indica shit that was going around yeah
and that's what it rumored to be and I think that you know that Hawaiian indica line was like pretty
popular there for a few years what uh here's a good one and we can end with this this thing's
almost over um what what project are you most proud of like looking back on what you've done
to this point what are you most proud of oh man I just won cog in the wheel like I'm not
I just was preserving genetics because I thought it was important and at the time
um a lot of other people were getting rid of everything because it was starting to become
like a marketing game right it used to be able to grow dog shit and it still sell in fact it was the
most in demand product yeah 10 years later it was the opposite right nobody wanted the long
farm sativas and people didn't like smoking them anymore um it had become more of a marketing type
of cannabis market than it was before right yeah and uh so for me it's I I'm just happy that I was
in the right place at the right time was able to get a lot of these really good cuts and kind of uh
put them all in one place and make sure that they they stuck around I mean that's it
one more quick one uh your collab the tie with uh with uh with Casas
yeah that was Chris's brother's cut um he lived in Portland Chris gave me that cut uh when he
I think when he moved back or actually I think I got it from his buddy up here a couple years after
he moved back to LA something like that and I I had uh seeded it up with the face off I never sold
seeds of it yeah um but uh I made seeds with it I have Albert Walker face or Albert Walker Manic
crossed with uh that tie also um and I I gave Chris a handful of those seeds and he's he's
gonna work it just partly in homage to his brother that tie was really interesting it definitely
it was like um it was like bubble gum and burnt onion or not burnt onion but like a like a really
strong cutting onion smell and uh bubble gum and like a little bit of the super silver haze
yeah uh hazy back end but not not really like when you smell it you don't think haze it's mostly that
like a tropical uh cut onion uh type of smell so it's pretty unique then oh it's super unique and
it was it was stunk and I mean it did like the classic uh little uh bananas all up the calyxes
up the on the top colas when it finished up just like the millie too yep well hey dude we we
actually did this thank you so much for coming on and like educating everyone and and uh next
