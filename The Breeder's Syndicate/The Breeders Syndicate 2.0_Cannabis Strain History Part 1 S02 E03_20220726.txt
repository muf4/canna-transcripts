Ready, go!
ðŸŽµ
Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
ðŸŽµ
What's up cool cats and kittens?
How ya doin'?
We're gonna have a fun time today.
So in a little bit, we will be joined by Notso.
Oh, here he is.
What's up, buddy?
I put out your favorite guitar.
Oh, I see that.
Yeah, all for you.
Indeed. I mean, this background is nicer than the yellow two-tone.
Yeah, it is. It is. It is better than the nicer two-tone.
Yeah.
So I'm waiting for some people to pop in,
and then we can get started.
We're gonna talk about a few different lines.
We're gonna talk some Northern Lights, I believe.
I think we're gonna talk some Widow, which we've never done.
No, not yet.
We haven't covered that. We probably should devote a full episode
to just the White family at some point.
But, um, we can touch on it here.
It definitely changed things.
Yeah, it definitely changed everything post-95.
Yeah?
Is that a 95 thing?
Yeah, it's a 95 thing.
And it kinda, it kinda dominated that and its hybrids
for probably a good...
20 years?
Well, I mean, at least, at least the next 5 or 10,
you know?
It ended up winning, it and its children and its cousins and stuff
won a bunch of cups, and it ended up getting crossed to everything.
Everything known to man, and F-Ginned, and copied, and renamed.
Oh, yeah. I mean, I remember when, um,
there used to be this, uh,
there used to be this, like, harvest festival
that got thrown at the end of every season up by me,
and it was kinda like word of mouth.
Is that the, uh, the NCGA one?
Yeah, indeed.
10% Ron!
10% Ron, indeed.
But, I mean, it was like a place where, like, you know,
CSI and, and, like, a lot of people from, like, the forums
and, you know, that were movers and shakers in both America and Europe
kinda came out, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, and what's funny about that is, like,
when I first went to those things,
I was, like, hoping, because I, you know,
whatever it was, 20-some years ago now,
so I was in my 20s, obviously,
I was hoping to meet, like, old-timers like me
that had what I, that had things that I wanted, right?
I was like, oh, I'm gonna get to go to this thing,
and I'm gonna meet all these people,
and it was, like, everything that was popular on Cannabis World.
BCGA stuff?
I mean, you know, not that it was bad, but I just mean, like,
Blue Widow, you know?
Apollo 13, Apollo 11, Genius.
Um, you know, but the two most common things
that were crossed then was, well, the three,
where it's probably the Blue family,
the White family,
and some stuff like Sweet Tooth that was coming out of Steve.
Yeah, and which was part of the Blue family.
Yeah, people were taking males of that stuff
and crossing it to everything.
Yeah.
Literally everything.
So just about everything there,
not everything there, but a lot of things there
were some combination of those three families
bred into everything else.
Yeah.
So there was White everything.
So let's start with the White tales.
Do you want to start with Shanti or Ingimar
or somewhere in between?
Oh, we can, uh, we can start with,
I guess we'll start with, I guess we'll start with Shanti.
Okay.
Right?
The Great Place?
So what's an absolute fact is, like, in 1995,
Neville and Sensi and that whole crew,
they still kind of dominated the scene, right?
Yeah.
And Shanti at the, at the Greenhouse label,
he released White Widow, right?
Which had a combination of,
it was different than all the stuff that other people,
it wasn't just a renamed rehashed thing,
which is so common right now.
And, but back then in Europe too, right?
Yeah.
It wasn't a rehash.
It was something new and it was a super frosty,
potent, um,
high THC Afghan that crossed well with things.
And it sort of turned cannabis on its head.
Yeah.
I think it had a killer name, you know?
And that was like back in the day when you'd get those like
high times with the super nice spreads for the cannabis cups
and like White everything would just started being labeled
throughout all those winters.
It looked gorgeous, um, all that type of stuff.
So, so that's indisputable as Shanti came out with a seed line.
Yeah.
About everything else about it is, is,
I guess you could say is disputable.
Uh, there's versions that exist, right?
Uh,
there's one version which Shanti will tell you that he bred it
and it came from his stuff and it, and it's a, you know,
and you know, that's, that's where it came from.
It came from his travels and his stuff and he brought it there.
There's another,
there's another story that is kind of purported by like,
I guess Arjun would be it and Ingmar.
And,
and pretty much all of Amsterdam is, uh,
on the Ingmar side as, as best I asked, you know, all the,
so Ingmar, Ingmar is this,
is this Dutch gentleman and supposedly in like 89 or 90,
he was smoking hash and out of the hash fell a few seeds.
Yeah.
Which is pretty uncommon,
but some,
it must've gotten just pressed in there or whatever.
And so he found this thing that was supposedly like,
uh,
maybe the cut of white widow and they started selling it at grow stores.
Right.
And they started selling it to friends and they started passing it around.
And,
um,
you know,
Arjun claims that he bought it from dude years before Shanti got involved.
And all that.
Um,
so where it came from and who developed it and all that,
there's kind of two camps and it depends on who you talk to.
All those dudes have beef with one another.
So it can be kind of hard to,
uh,
get like past the beef,
but definitely where it became,
what made it famous was it being released Shanti releasing another greenhouse
label in 95.
Yeah.
And,
and in fairness,
you're always good at passing the beef,
dude.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,
what's interesting about that actually is that,
so when I was a kid and I was going over to Amsterdam,
a bunch,
there was a bunch of dudes then that were in their forties.
Now they're in their sixties and seventies,
I guess.
Right.
Yeah.
And they,
a lot of,
there was camps just like we have now in California.
There's people that had beefs with each other.
There are people that felt wronged on deals that went bad or partnerships that
went bad or whatever the case may be.
Amsterdam in the nineties is actually like a pretty good indicator of
cannabis.
And now,
yeah,
it is.
Yeah.
Cause humans are the same.
Yep.
Like we don't change all that much.
So all the same type of interactions and all the same,
like,
well you get credit,
you got credit for this,
but it was really mine.
You know,
that shit happens all the time today.
Right.
If I remember correctly to peacemaker was another one that was debated.
I think a peacemaker was also Ingimar's peacemaker was also great white shark.
So they debated over that.
I was at that cannabis cup when peacemaker one.
And I think it's,
that's,
that's one of the coolest names.
Yeah.
It's a good one.
It's a really good,
it's,
it's shitty that they got rid of it and turned it into a great white shark.
Yeah.
Which is a cool name on its own,
but it's like not quite peacemaker,
which is now shark shock.
Right.
Yeah.
So peacemaker,
peacemaker became great white shark and then greenhouse trademarked great white shark.
So you can't call only greenhouse can call strains that.
Yeah.
And then when a Shanti left,
he called it,
uh,
you know,
shark shock.
Yeah.
So it's had,
you know,
like a lot of cannabis strains.
It's had three or four different names depending on what era you're in.
Uh,
I went through hundreds of those seeds and,
uh,
it,
um,
it was a really weird line.
I loved it a lot.
Actually.
Some of the most potent weed I've ever smoked came out of that line.
But the weird part was,
is that I,
I could get really skunky,
like really turpy skunky ones that were mild to moderate potency.
And I could get super potent ones that tasted like cool smoke,
but I could never get the,
the,
the skunky super potent one in the same plant.
It sounds like that's a common,
um,
kind of thing with,
yeah,
I don't,
I mean,
I looked wise.
I kept one that I would,
I would classify as Turpless.
Yeah.
I've had an Afghan Kush like that.
That was very Turpless.
I mean,
it didn't have bad,
it didn't have off turps.
Yeah,
no,
but it was like the absence of flavor.
Yeah.
But it was so potent,
honestly,
like it gave me tracers in my vision that I kept it even because even though it
didn't taste like anything,
like nothing,
you know?
And so I,
I probably ran through two,
three,
400,
something like that.
Seeds of great white shark from greenhouse trying to find,
because if I would have found,
if you could have found a super potent one with as skunky as some of them were,
yeah,
I mean that would have,
you know,
yeah.
A lot of people's daily smoke.
Yeah,
for sure.
But the white did that.
I mean,
that's kind of like,
uh,
I just called it the white,
but you know,
I'm just kidding with you folks.
White widow.
But yeah,
white,
white widow was one of those things where it's like kind of like the NL line
with Neville.
It's,
it's,
it's like,
it didn't have a lot of turps,
but it was super potent and super pretty.
And it added,
it made the bud look nicer and it made it look frostier and it made it look
denser,
all those things that growers like.
And so people started blending it with everything,
you know,
uh,
like blue widow was super famous.
Well,
20 years ago,
they're in those parties,
right?
And you could get the turps from the blue and some of the color and you
could get the potency from the other.
Like it was a pretty good marriage.
Yeah.
If you could get the frostiness and resin production of the widow on the
blue,
but yeah,
widow was one of those things just like,
you know,
cookies or Skittles or something like that,
where like everybody got it and crossed it to everything they had to see
what would come up.
Yep.
That's kind of like,
it was one of those types of strains.
Yeah.
It was,
for me,
it was one of the first like mega hyped name strings for my generation.
Like,
uh,
I,
you know,
when we were first getting bags of fucking really good weed,
everybody would call it either white,
Ryan,
Ryan,
white rhino or white widow,
whether it was or not,
but it was one of the first ones in my generation that really broke through
with the names.
Shanti still sells white,
white rhino.
I think he calls it medicine man or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something along those lines.
And then like,
uh,
Simon had white Russian,
which I liked a lot.
Which was,
which was,
uh,
AK 47 by white widow.
Yep.
Um,
so yeah,
it got,
it was a greenhouse.
It was at serious seeds.
It was white labeled like crazy.
All the Canadians,
all the Canadians had it and crossed it into everything.
Yep.
Um,
so there was a,
yeah,
but blue widow was probably like,
that was like two totally unrelated families that liked each other.
Yeah.
That was some pretty good shit.
It was a pretty good shit.
Ron had a really good cut of that,
that he'd pass around.
Yeah,
it was good.
And then people,
tons of people had seed of that.
It was pretty free seed trading era.
It was before ST,
it was before the,
the feminized revolution.
Yeah.
You know,
so it was all still male based.
And,
uh,
when it was easy to fucking make seeds,
it was easy to,
yeah.
I mean,
I,
I don't think I don't even know anyone that's ever had a failure with a male.
Uh,
yeah,
I don't either.
I mean,
you'd have to,
I mean,
you could have one or two males in your room and hit it with a stick at the
right time and get a hundred percent pollination everywhere.
Exactly.
The amount of effort that people go through now to like,
make sure they get enough pollen out of reversals.
Uh,
and then,
and then even with that and all still the failure rate and all that,
but that back then it was like,
yeah,
you picked your best couple of males,
but it was like,
what do you call it?
Uh,
you call it shop,
the shotgunning method.
You don't really know what the male is going to do till you crack the seeds.
Yeah.
So you're just kind of,
you know,
everything's playing until you run it.
Everything's yeah.
You know?
And so,
so yeah.
So the white widow is like,
the story is either Shanti breaded,
uh,
which is like Sean and Shanti still sells it.
Or,
uh,
it was a clone that got found in Afghanistan and in Afghani hash.
Yeah.
And was sold as a clone.
Um,
so maybe they're both true in a way because someone had to take it and,
and make a seed line from it.
And so I think both of them claimed that there was Brazilian in it too.
There was some kind of Brazilian sativa mixed in.
And if you look at like the,
if you look at all those picks and all the Finos you're getting from the
nineties,
it was pretty heavily influenced by the Afghan side of things.
Sure.
Yeah.
And then the black widow now that you can get from Shanti,
people find all kinds of sativa expressions in those.
So I don't really,
I mean,
you know,
it's probably the,
the parents probably changed at some point.
Oh,
it's a long time to keep cuts.
I would imagine.
You know,
I mean,
none of those,
none of those,
none of those,
none of those euros ever admit that they lost anything,
but everybody knows it.
Yeah,
no,
they don't,
you know,
they don't have all the same original parents,
you know?
Yeah.
So sure.
But yeah,
I mean,
white,
white widow was a,
that was,
that was a game changer as far as that goes.
One of the biggest during its time.
One of the biggest.
Yeah.
I mean,
it kind of,
it kind of replaced skunk one as the,
the primary thing that people crossed,
you know,
cause that's what would happen in Amsterdam.
It's like some new amazing thing would come out and everybody would buy
seeds of it and then mix it with their own shit and try to get on the same
sales hype.
Oh yeah.
Like they do now.
It was like standard operating procedure.
And then that's even why people should know that too,
right?
Is that like,
that's even why some of the old time breeders and stuff,
they get all sketchy about telling you actual lineage because they know that
whatever lineage they say is just going to end up on some competitors pack.
Yeah.
So,
you know,
Shauntzi gets out there and says,
Oh,
it's this by this by this.
And this is what we did do it.
And then that exact thing is,
is on his,
is two or three other seed companies.
Yeah.
They're using,
you know,
so a lot of times people like it,
it sucks.
Like,
but we went from like Neville and some people like that being very direct to
today where people hide the secret sauce.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's,
it still doesn't make any sense.
I,
you know,
when I see people hiding their lineage,
it tells me usually if it,
if it's a seed maker or a breeder that's hiding the lineage,
it just tells me that they're,
they don't understand how expression works or any of that.
Cause there's no reason to even try to hide that kind of stuff.
You can't make the same thing happen twice and people get the same exact
expressions twice,
you know,
no real weird things.
I just think,
I think it's an ego thing.
Yeah.
People,
people like the illusion that people did a lot more work before they released
those seeds to you.
Yeah,
that's,
that is true.
I mean,
I'm not saying that's everybody,
but that definitely percolates through the seed fucking world as far as I'm
concerned.
Yeah.
People,
people,
people don't like accidents.
They want it to all be intentional and you know,
private genius that they revealed to the world.
Right now.
These guys are killing me.
Oh,
Jake hash,
Jake hash,
you know,
and Jake,
Jake hash.
I mean,
I suppose I,
I never saw any,
I never saw any seeds come out of hash,
but that doesn't mean it's not possible.
Yeah,
sure.
Especially back then when they were just whipping shit,
they weren't really filtering it.
None of that kind of shit.
Compressing the block.
Yeah.
But I mean,
it happens back then.
I mean,
90,
you know,
and,
and,
you know,
I will say that like that area of Europe was the primary
export area for that,
for hashish from Afghanistan.
Yeah.
Like there's an old hash smoking culture in Northern Europe over
there.
And so they did have a bunch of like,
that was America got much shittier hash than Europe.
Yeah.
Europe.
There was like the hash game.
Europe,
Europe.
Well,
then not only that,
there was traditional and been there for a long time.
There wasn't oceans in the way that you could get there via land,
you know,
and through a bunch of countries that weren't as hardcore about
searching for shit as America.
Yeah.
We got secret hash.
Most of the time.
I didn't even realize how good traditional hash could be until I got to
Amsterdam and started meeting certain people.
Yeah.
You know,
really eyeopening.
All right.
Before I derail this conversation,
I'm going to put up a pack of the banana tie.
F1s up.
If anybody wants them,
I'm starting them at 200 and then we're going to go back to talking.
So I'll just pin it as we go.
And as it gets higher,
I'll add more shit in,
but I don't want to derail the conversation too much.
So yes,
banana tie at 200.
Banana tie at 200.
Yeah,
there we go.
There we go.
So,
so yeah,
I mean,
I don't know.
We,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't even think,
I think white widow was probably the widow family was probably the primary
thing until kind of like the sour and diesel wave.
Yeah,
I think it was happening.
You know,
and then,
and then Kush came kind of quickly behind that.
Like Kush had been around for a minute,
but like in order to become popular enough,
people have to have it.
Yeah.
And it was very hoarded.
So,
you know,
I mean,
that's,
that's,
that's the weird thing.
It's like,
I mean,
there was only like four of us in California that had it.
Yeah.
So like how many,
how,
you know,
how many can like four garages and a couple light depths and,
and whatever else even do.
I think people underrate how much the can of Bible came into play during this
time,
during that era,
right at the end of the widow era into the Kush era in popularizing a lot of
these strains that people had never heard of smoked seen before stuff that was
held super tight.
No,
your stuff.
Yeah.
Jason,
Jason King was at those was at those events.
Yeah.
You know,
I was pretty good friends with him back then.
And actually like in,
especially in the second and third can of Bible.
Yeah.
You know,
a lot of the people that he met and he photographed were either friends or
associates of ours.
Yeah.
Like he came to Lake,
he,
he was living in one of Eddie Leps houses in Lake County and we would take
pictures of him all over Mendo and humble and stuff like that.
And you know,
he would take,
he would get pictures of various people's farms and get introduced.
Cause back then,
especially like you couldn't just be like a photographer and be like,
I want to take pictures of your weed.
Yeah,
no,
no,
that was,
that was,
that was not the era that that was acceptable.
So you kind of needed like a friend,
someone who like would vouch for your existence.
Yeah.
You know?
And so we,
you know,
we had a lot of,
I think it's only like the second one.
My super dog is in there a bunch of times.
The Mendo perps is in there.
The chem dog is in there.
The snow we had about,
I don't know,
mothership.
We had about seven or eight things,
nine things or something like that,
that we're all in there.
The pineapple mothership.
Was that one that you grew?
Yeah.
The,
the I'm in a Mendo.
Somebody just asked that the mothership is kind of a crazy story,
dude.
I should tell it just because people would trip out.
So Jason King had this girl.
Friend at the time.
And she was from the mountains of North Carolina,
right?
Asheville,
all that.
And as most people probably know,
Asheville is kind of like,
it's a little different than the rest of Northern North Carolina.
It's a little bit more hippie.
It's a little bit more eclectic and all that.
And so they had this,
they had this strain out there.
They called the mothership.
Right.
And so he,
she was going to get it shipped out here.
Because it was this old ass sativa that we wanted to try.
Right.
Yeah.
So I agreed,
they ship it out.
And again,
I'm thinking to myself,
it's going to come and it's going to be,
you know,
a couple of clones on a little box,
you know?
And this is,
this has got to be.
Oh,
two or something like that.
So long before smartphones or like checking your package on lot,
like,
you know,
just mailed it.
And when it showed up,
it showed up.
Right.
Yeah.
So I'm expecting this little box of clones.
And I opened the door one day and there's this box.
That's like two feet tall on my doorstep.
I'm like,
fuck.
So I take it inside.
I have no idea what the hell it is.
And I open it up and there's two plants,
a mothership in there.
In dirt pots,
staked.
And they're like,
they're like,
you know,
22,
24 inches tall.
Each one of them.
There's two full one gallon pots with,
with a,
with a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a,
a.
And it was a one gallon pots with two footplates bent over in there.
Yeah.
And then they tamped down a bunch of packing material and stuff.
So the dirt didn't fall.
Yeah.
So instead of mailing us cuts or like unrooted snips or any of like the
modern tech or whatever,
they literally mailed us two,
two foot tall plants in one gallon pots.
That's one way to do it.
Yeah.
They both lived.
Yeah.
And all of those,
in the Canada Bible of Mothership,
they all pretty much come from those two moms.
So what was in Mothership, do you know?
I have no idea.
No clue?
No, no clue.
I didn't even like it that much, to be perfectly honest.
It has some off.
I know it still exists, which is cool,
just because I don't think it's related to much else.
But it did this neat thing where it grew all these golf
balls all over it.
And the thing was super floppy.
But it's the only plant I've ever seen
that it would flop over like 50% and then just hold itself up
and grow sideways.
So you really didn't need to stake it.
It would flop.
But then its stem would catch itself.
And instead of snapping or just hitting the dirt or something
like that, it would hold itself up.
And so if you grew it in a greenhouse or indoor,
it would grow sideways through your plants.
And it would weave itself through other plants you had.
That's fucking weird.
Yeah.
It was a really unusual trait.
Its stems didn't want to snap.
And they would give and then bring themselves back up.
Yeah, that's interesting.
But that was kind of in that era where weed was weed.
Yeah.
That was even before the purple craze, where
Urkel and Grape Ape and Grandaddy and all that shit
kind of took over.
That was sort of like the last era where people like any type
of quality weed that people grew sold easily.
Yeah.
Right?
So people grew whatever they wanted.
So was it a sativa type high to it?
It had a sativa type high.
Traditionally sativa type high.
It had fox taily buds.
Was it long flowering or not?
It wasn't particularly long flowering, like 11 weeks
or something like that.
And if you grew it outdoor, you kind of
wanted to let it ride till Halloween.
But in Mendo and Lake County and stuff like that,
that wasn't that hard to achieve.
Yeah.
There was lots of weed.
Most good weed, in my opinion, was
done between the 15th of October and early November,
at least where I'm from.
So people are asking for the Not So Dog story,
the name of Not So Dog.
We got to do it one more time.
The name of Not So Dog?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
Maybe I'll give the edited version.
So the edited version is my buddy who gave it to me
also gave it to a couple other people, right?
Not very many people had.
There was like four of us.
He gave it to Skunk VA.
He gave it to IC Collective.
There was a couple up there.
But there wasn't, it was like four, maybe five
at the most who had it.
And so we used to do this thing where not everybody
had fresh weed all the time.
So we'd keep each other in the loop about who
had what coming down when.
So this person could grab a couple ounces.
This person could grab QP or whatever.
So you'd have smoke.
So you'd have fresh smoke.
And so my buddy from New York, he goes up to Tahoe
to grab, we called it the Tahoe dog, right?
And it grew killer up there because it's so cold that the
air that he would, especially in winter,
the air that he would bring into his grow room
would be like in the single digits of the teens.
And it would make that shit frost up, like really strong.
Like it looked like compared to Mendo and Sonoma
where the rest of us were, like that mountain weed was like,
it was nice.
It was really nice.
I had the same effect in Chicago in the wintertime.
Like there's something about bringing in frigid air
that just makes your plants, makes it,
it's like a reactionary thing.
I don't know.
So anyway, he goes up there, he goes up there to get this,
he goes up there to get like a pound of dog, right?
And he's supposed to split it with me.
And so he comes back and I was living,
we were living in Willets at the time,
which is in Northern Mendo.
And he's like, dude, come meet me and get this thing.
So I come meet him and we're like, it's the middle of winter
and we're off on the side road and he hands me the bag
and he goes, tell me what you think.
There's something a little different this time.
And I opened the bag and I stuck my hand in this bag
and I started smelling it.
And I was like, this is not so dog.
And he's like, what do you mean?
And I'm like, it's not so dog.
And he's like, I don't get what you mean.
And I'm like, I'm smelling it
and it doesn't smell like the dog.
It smells like not, it's not so, I don't get the,
and it turns out that Homie had,
Homie had mislabeled a cut
and then kept that cut as a monk.
Oh, that's the worst.
And then it was actually like, it was actually Romulan.
And that's why dude from New York was tripping
because it was so frosty and so different.
He just thought he did this weird thing
and he crushed it and he brings it to me.
And I'm like, I'm like in the dark,
I hadn't even seen it yet.
I didn't even know what it looked like.
I just stuck my face in the bag and I was like, it's not.
And so fast forward, right?
And I'm trying to, I'm trying to join Instagram
because everybody was bugging me
that I needed to climb out from under my rock
and then join Instagram, right?
And so I'm trying to join
and every fucking name I pick is already chosen.
So after about 20 or 30 tries, I get all pissed off
and I think, well, what if I try this?
And I put in not so, and that wasn't taken.
There you go.
There you go.
So it was kind of like, it was just kind of
like an inside joke about how when Homie,
I mean, he got it back, we gave him the dog back.
Amongst us, there was like, it never got lost,
but there was individuals that lost it briefly
and they had to get it back from one of the other of us
over that time period.
Do you remember our not so experience
at one of the houses, the not so Bubba?
The not so Bubba.
I do, yeah.
I do, the not so Bubba.
That is a, yeah.
So that was funny too, because I had grown, I don't know.
I had like a couple of beds that I basically grew
like all this head stash.
Yeah.
And then I basically like, you know,
I was so busy with harvest and all that,
that I put all that head stash.
We dried it and bagged it and put it away, you know?
And then I dug it all out.
I think it was me and a few of our friends or whatever,
like a night or two before that party.
And we went and we dug out like 40 or 50 kinds of weed
and jarred it up and brought it all down.
And this guy that we're no longer friends with anymore,
I won't even say his name.
Not even worth it, yeah.
He had given me the Bubba Kush back,
but it was actually Canerato's 5x2.
Yeah, it was the 5x2, his selection of it.
It was his selection of the 5x2.
And so I crack open this jar and I'm like showing it
like our buddy Pip was there and Bittersweet
and a bunch of us, you know?
And it was like, people are like,
dude, do you know what the Bubba is?
And I was like, yeah, I know what the Bubba is.
And they're like, what is this weed?
And I was like, I don't know.
And then the weirdest part of that thing
was on top of all that weed,
there was a big fat nugget Trinity.
Yeah, yeah.
But it wasn't, there was only one nug
of that trend on top of it.
And then the rest of it was all that other,
that was like some light terpenelein, midsy.
Yeah, it was not a great expression.
No, whatever that was,
was not a great expression of cannabis in general.
No, no, that was some mids.
I love the fact that it was that dude's selection though.
Yeah.
His personal selection.
I mean, you know, when you only pop 10 or 15 seeds
or something like that, it's really hard to find a winner.
Yeah, yeah, that and like, you know,
things do change from seed to clone.
And as time goes, maybe it was cool as a seedling,
but it really was not cool as a clone or something.
Something.
No, no.
And that was, we were lucky though.
That was really the only thing that was mislabeled
out of all that work.
Yeah, and that magical Trinity nug, right?
That magical, that threw us off even more
because that thing was so different, you know?
Yeah, we're like, what the fuck did,
how did this Trinity get in here?
Yeah, but I mean, we had, I mean, that year,
I think we had, I had two six foot by 26 foot beds
that I just grew like all the mother stock
and all the head stash.
Yeah.
Those two years in a row, I think I did that.
Yeah.
And I brought all that work down to, down to that party.
So there was literally like probably like 40 flavors
or something on it.
Yeah, it was wild.
Every time we still have pictures of that, both parties.
Yeah.
It was wild.
And then some of it I didn't bring because it wasn't done.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, I think the 91 wasn't done at that point.
No, I didn't bring the, I brought the Chem D.
Yeah, yeah.
I remember you bringing the Chem D,
especially the second time when resin got the,
the white hot sweats.
That was actually pretty weird
because you always talk about things, you know,
and like, just so people know when they're listening,
you know, we have friends from all over and stuff
and we chat on Discord and some different things.
And so you talk about all this weed,
but it's not like you get to smoke all your buddy's weed
because we're a pretty like dispersed group.
You know, there's people, there's friends of ours
from all over the country, all over California.
And so a lot of times like we gather up
and it would be some of these people's
first chance to smoke like some of this stuff.
Yeah.
You know, and that Chem D that I did inside,
I grew it under ceramics, ceramic metal halides.
And it put a few people on the couch
not being able to speak.
Yeah.
You know, one of the, one of the,
our friend resin was one of the very first people
to grow OG Kush in LA.
He got so high off sharing a joint
that he almost decided to go to bed and call it a night.
Yeah.
Remember that?
He recovered.
Yeah.
All of a sudden he's like just sitting there sweating
for like 30 minutes, just kind of,
and then he just goes, I'm back fellas.
I'm back.
To the blue.
Made us all pick our pants.
So that was really, that was, yeah,
that's kind of cool too, because a lot of times like,
you know, you can smoke good weed
and I don't care what kind of weed it is.
Eventually you build some level of tolerance
to that specific stuff.
But if you've never smoked it before,
you haven't smoked it in months
and you smoke something different, you know,
like we're going to talk about the headband cut
that I have in a bit.
Like that weed will get you high every day, all day long.
Yeah.
But if you haven't smoked it in two or three months
or longer and you smoke that weed,
the first four or five, 10 times you smoke it,
it's like different.
Yeah.
And there's a lot of weed that's like that.
Yeah.
I think, you know, that like, if you're not,
whatever it's cannabinoids and entourage effect
or whatever combination, it just like,
your body's not used to it.
And so it hits you a little bit different.
Yeah. It could even be, you're in a different house,
different environment,
all kinds of things go into that for me.
So somebody was saying, I missed that kind of bud.
It's not around like that.
And you're kind of right, but it is around,
but it's like people's, what people pick has changed.
Yeah. You're not going to find that in mostly
in cookies hybrids.
It's just not.
You know, you're like, you're most people,
like 20 years ago,
the only reason why things were elite was
because enough smokers liked them.
Yeah. Right.
That was pretty much it.
And now it's a lot based on testing and looks and hype
and other various aspects.
So there's a lot of flash in the pans or mids or whatever
that get pushed, you know, where, you know,
back in the day, it's like, I don't,
not even everyone had to say it was an elite.
Yeah.
But enough smokers who were respectable were like,
this weed is fire.
Yeah.
And it's kind of become generally acceptable
that whatever that was is fire.
Yeah.
You know?
And the, you know, the name strain game
has been really bad for diversity.
Sure has.
Sure has.
You know, so I see people.
I remember one of those years,
I think it was Denali brought,
now I'm used to smoking blueberries and stuff
and I'm used to them being, you know,
anti-anxiety for me and chill.
And he brought out some old right,
Berry OG crossed a G13 hash plant seeds
I'd made a long time ago and he grew it
and he handed me a doobie that I got the Coke shits.
I remember just like walking up in that house,
that first house, like up the stairs, like,
yeah, that was fucked up.
There's some shit that'll get you.
That's actually one of the things like,
even when I was talking about those Ron parties
20 years ago, is if you show up in a vent
and you smoke 10 or 15 or 20 kinds of weed,
and you're not used to smoking,
you're gonna get some odd effects.
Yeah.
You know.
One second, drowning with Dagon.
I don't know how to pronounce that.
Yes, that is the one with juicy fruit tiny
and it's up for auction right now at 220.
Someone says, someone says you're growing,
if you're growing the headband and can be.
What's that?
Any advice?
People are asking about advice on the headband and can be.
I don't really, I mean,
those are two of like what I consider to be
like the most potent strains I personally have.
So, you know, there's a lot.
I would just try to find plants you like.
You know, I mean, as far as effect goes.
That's me, that's generally speaking the advice
I always give is it's like,
what, try to find something you personally like.
You know, when you're sprouting seeds.
Everyone's brain chemistry is vastly different.
So yeah, find something you like.
Yeah, I mean, there's things that like I love personally
and Matt would despise as a daily smoker.
Oh yeah, for sure.
And CSI and I don't have the same tastes at all
when it comes to, he recognizes like we have the same taste
as far as like what we think of as good weed.
But what we, our preferences
on what we like to smoke are very different.
Yeah, I think Urkel even hits in the same way
that it hits me, whereas we like to breed with it a lot.
We like to grow it a lot, but fuck, we will not smoke it
because everything with it gives us fucking panic attacks
every fucking time.
People are talking about flowering time.
So the Chem D is usually like a,
I would say it's anywhere from like eight and a half
to nine weeker, 10 weeker at the most.
And the LA is more like a 10 or 11 most of the time.
So most of your phenos are probably gonna come
in that like nine to 11 range.
And if it's real squat and Afghan looking,
it probably leans D.
If it's tall and lanky,
it probably leans a little bit more of the headband.
Yeah.
And we have some of the LA Kush coming up,
probably gonna be crossed to the NL5.
The second round of the NL5 stuff,
we are doing some hybrids with it,
as well as not so, let's talk about your Maui.
So the Maui, the Maui is a cool story
in the sense that it goes like way back.
So we, in 1994, which seems eons ago now, I guess.
We had just, me and my crew had just kind of turned adults.
And back then it's like,
and especially in the Midwest where I was from,
that's where you went to go get good weed.
Seeds was Amsterdam, right?
Yeah.
And so we all flew out to Amsterdam
and the short version of the story
is we bought a bunch of seeds
and we were in this coffee shop
and there was this old man
who was probably like in his forties or whatever.
But to us when we were late teens, he seemed ancient.
I'm sure.
And we literally like shared a cappuccino
and shared a couple of joints
and shot the shit for 20 or 30 minutes.
And he told us that he was from America
and he came out, he was from Maui
and he came out and he traded,
he was trading seeds with some of the dudes in Europe
and he did it every few years, right?
And he gave us a handful of seeds.
Well, just so happens that we go back
and we bloom all this shit that we bought.
And the best thing that we had was this weed from Maui
that the dude had given us at a coffee shop for free.
And so since we didn't know anything about it
cause we're dumb and we didn't ask any questions
cause we were like 19 or whatever,
only thing I know about it is that the dude grew it on Maui
and it is a really, it's kind of a strange plant
in that it has super thin, very thin,
almost like tie type leaves.
They're double serrated up both sides.
It has like red PDLs on the underside of everything.
Yeah.
And, but it's short, it's only like eight weeks,
eight and a half weeks.
And it yields huge chunks all over itself, top to bottom.
So it, but then it had, it throws leaves all over itself
and the leaves are so thin, unlike a lot of Afghanis,
it doesn't really choke itself out with over overleafage.
Yeah.
You can like see through it, if that makes sense
because all the leaves are like this wide,
you know, they're all really skinny, you know?
And so we, that, yeah.
So CSI, I gave him that cut.
So that cut is, we sprouted that seed in the summer of 1994.
So it's going to be 28 years old this year.
Jesus Christ.
Something like that.
And he also has another Maui, I think as well,
the Maui Waui, if I remember correctly.
Yeah.
So, so he, so that one and that Maui,
that Maui ended up becoming relatively famous
because I, in probably like 02 or 03-ish,
I gave a bunch of seeds to Mandelbrot of which,
you know, I gave him a bunch of super dog by,
Maui by super dog.
And he found this cut called the truth in there.
And he ended up breeding a bunch with that.
So that Maui kind of like percolated around
and it was grown in Mendo for years and years
because it'll give you a four to six pound plant
that's done October 15th.
Yeah.
And it's got great resin production too.
It's got great resin production.
It's, I wouldn't call it like an absolute elite, you know?
Like.
I think it's beautiful though.
But it's got, it's beautiful.
It's, it's got a decent high.
It's got crazy structure, crazy yield.
It's a really, it's like one of the better plants
I've ever crossed things to.
Yeah.
So, so yeah, that he's gonna use, he likes pairing things
or like looking at different varieties
and trying to see what he thinks
is gonna cross well together.
So maybe something to do with, you know,
Northern Lights has, you know,
potentially some Hawaiian in it,
different ones or whatever.
Like he's gonna cross that to the,
that's gonna get ended up getting crossed to the Maui.
But he released, what was it?
He released the TK by Maui by TK and Maui by D.
Yeah.
And I get pictures all the time.
It really seems like those, those Maui by Kim
or the LA by Kim D people find tons of killer shit in it.
Yeah.
Hopefully, you know, one of the things that's good
about CSI is that he's prolific.
Yeah.
He's very prolific dude.
So by me sharing some cuts with him,
it gives people a chance to try a bunch of stuff
that they might hear about a bunch, you know,
because he's probably the most prolific breeder I know.
Someone was asking the flower time and parents
on the banana tie, which is up for auction right now.
God damn it.
It was the juicy fruit tie cross to the platinum banana
OGBX1 flowering times right around.
Some people are getting them around nine to 11 weeks.
Some pull it early.
It's, it tends to dominate towards the mother cut,
which is what I would have liked it to have done,
except that it does have added resin production.
And some have that beautiful banana with like juicy
fruit stripes gum.
For those of my age, fruit stripes gum is the best
description of what that, that mother cut smells like.
And right now it's at 220.
Yeah.
So if you guys want to grab it, I don't have a lot of left.
So I'm just putting it up and I'll throw in a pack
of the silver pearl blue bonnet as well,
which is actually perfect pearl blue bonnet.
The silver pearl S1 from our buddy Pip.
Yeah.
I'll toss that into.
And that's a nice cut too.
Dude, that cut is phenomenal.
I fell in love with it the first second I even saw it,
let alone smoked it.
Once I smoked it, it has this,
it has its own type of bubble gumminess,
which will lead me into something else,
but it has its own type of bubble gumminess
that really was brought out with the blue bonnet.
It has a lot of good blueberry bubble gum phenos.
And speaking of bubble gum,
me and TSI have a selection inside the NL5.
We call it the number seven.
And it is, as he puts it,
and he's a big fan of Indiana bubble gum.
It's one of his favorite breeders, all of it.
It is more pink bubble gum, louder pink bubble gum
than the Indiana bubble gum cut.
So we're really excited to bring that one out.
And we're also crossing that specific cut
to bubble gum at some point.
So a couple of things,
I'll talk about silver pearl in a second,
but one of the things that we should probably mention
that's neat is that one of the things
that CSI does that a lot of other people doesn't do,
at least, is that you can do multi-stage breeding.
Right?
Where what Matt was just talking about
is it's like he popped a bunch of stuff.
He found things that he liked.
He made selections.
And then he's crossing those selections
to a wide variety of other things.
And so there's a lot of breeding right now
just because the way the market is,
it's kind of like one-offs.
So it is neat in that sea of one-offs
where you can do some multi-stage,
where you can pick things, select things,
cross those things to other things that you like
once you figure out what it is.
And all that.
And bubble gum is a terp in Afghani.
Neville talked about some of the maple leaf stuff
smelling very strongly of bubble gums.
The original Big Bud Cut had a bubble gum-like nose.
So it's one of those terps
that occasionally pops up in Afghans.
You'll get a bubble gum nose.
And what's interesting about that
is that while the Indiana bubble gum
absolutely smells like chewing gum when it's growing
and when it's drying,
it doesn't really taste the same that it smells.
No, that's the one problem that I found with it
is that the taste doesn't translate as well
with the bubble gum.
The smell, I mean, when those terpenes in the air,
when it's blooming, it straight up smells like bubble gum.
And then you smoke it,
and if you got that Big League Chew-style flavor
on your taste buds,
it would probably be one of the highest
regarded cuts out there.
I've had this debate going on with CSI
about looking through the Durban poison,
Indiana bubble gum specifically,
because I found out in the 95-Centichar line,
there was a bunch of terpeneline,
and there was one pheno that was hardcore pink bubble gum
with some terpeneline.
And whereas it wasn't as pink bubble gum-y loud
as the Indiana bubble gum cut,
the flavor was all pink bubble gum.
So I think in that Durban, Indiana bubble gum,
there's likely to be some bubble gum-y tasting stuff.
He was probably trying to push you away from it
just because you'd have to sift
through so much terpeneline to find it.
There'd be a lot of terpeneline
that you'd have to find those ruts, as it were.
Somebody wanted to talk about the silver pearl,
so I'll talk about that before we lose track.
So our buddy Pip has a cut of silver pearl,
lineage and origin unknown,
but I will say it looks very, very, very much
like the pheno that Neville used to post
at the seed bank and at Scentsy.
Looks very, very, very similar to that exact plant.
And it looks like 90s weed,
for lack of a better term, don't you think?
It's very classic.
It's not super dense, kind of airy.
This might be something that people think is off-putting,
but there's a lot of smells in weed
that you wouldn't think are nice in other instances,
but in weed, you like them, right?
And it kind of smells to me like really young baby poo.
Really?
Oh, it does, yeah.
I've talked to them about it.
It has like a baby,
like not like when kids start eating food,
but like when they're on like a pure milk diet
and they're a couple months old, you know?
It has this like weird baby poo type smell to it.
It does have a funk to it.
It has a funk to it, you know?
And what's interesting about that is like,
you might think, oh, gross, you know,
but roadkill is really gross.
Yeah.
Like there's no, you know, people are like,
oh, I want that.
There's stink in weed that like you relate it
to something else in life,
but whatever that is, it's gross.
Yeah, I've tried that Shoreline recently,
both indoor and outdoor,
and there is some fucking gross to that shit.
But it's good.
It tastes great.
So in weed, there's like a different aspect to it
where like you can describe things that might be gross,
but they're good.
Yeah, that he created this,
it was called Perfect Pearl, wasn't it?
Yeah, that was it.
It's S1s.
Yeah.
And so, yeah, he had this cut that I believe
it's from the 90s.
It just looks tough.
Yeah, I do too.
Like 90s weed, it's probably,
and we're basically lucky in that regard
because most weed from the 90s,
most lines, we're lucky if one or even two phenotypes exist.
Yeah.
At most.
Yeah.
You know, I mean, that's basically like how much
has survived from just like 30 years ago,
which is a crazy thing to say.
Yeah.
You know, so every,
what are the three gassiest strains you've ever come across?
I mean, gas, to me,
maybe we should talk about that for a second.
To me, gas is skunk, right?
Like it doesn't have to be,
but I feel like that straight skunk smell
and that sour diesel smell and that fuel terp
and the gassiness,
I think those are all like variations of the same terps.
But you're gonna confuse people that when you say skunk,
do you mean skunk one or do you mean super skunk?
Like actual skunk.
Yeah.
And we can talk, we'll talk about,
like skunk one is the most confusing name.
Yeah.
Because, you know, but yeah, I mean,
like actual like skunk aroma.
Which is like, everybody calls it like the lost terp.
And I think it exists in all these different forms,
just not in that pure roadkill form.
Yeah.
I think it's a lot more accessible than people realize.
They just don't listen.
You know, like headband,
like you look at diesel style plants,
which there's a lot of.
And they're just like, like from a breeder's perspective,
they're classic skunkoid type plants.
Yep.
Their bud structure, the way they grow,
the way they look kind of Mexican Columbian
with some density.
I mean, that to me is like the diesel family
is like modern skunk.
But keep, keep, keep,
I gotta keep insisting on specifying not skunk one
because I know that's all people are gonna hear and think.
Yeah, so we could clarify that too.
I mean, I don't post on IG very much,
but I kind of posted a couple times last week
because I got all mad about something
because this idiot blocked me for voicing my opinion.
But basically like the,
you can actually like look for a longer thing
on my post or whatever.
But basically when Sam the skunk man got skunk one,
it was super skunky.
According to Sam.
According to Sam, it reeked.
It didn't matter how you grew it, who grew it,
where you grew it, what you fed it,
what environmental conditions you had it in.
And it was all skunky and he didn't like it.
And so he spent from 75 according to him to the mid 80s,
doing everything he could to get that skunk smell
out of skunk one.
Because he didn't like the high nearly
and he didn't like the flavor.
So then he took some still slightly skunky skunk one
to Amsterdam and kept breeding it to sweet citrus,
floral, everything.
Yeah.
So for the last 30 years, every four or five years,
people come up and they say,
I've got this old rare special secret skunk one.
And you're pretty much,
you're gonna find what you want in that skunk one.
You're gonna, right?
And instead of just saying, oh, it's Sam skunk one
that Gypsy Nirvana couldn't give away.
Or I got it from seeds men,
or I got it from the flying Dutchman.
I got it from a million places
because everyone sells skunk one.
Phil sells it, never stopped selling it.
Never stopped selling it.
It's the most common weed strain in weed to this day.
Yeah.
Just because a bunch of Americans aren't growing it
doesn't mean it's the most common thing out there.
Yeah.
And they crossed it to everything in the 90s.
Everything was some female by skunk one.
Yes.
It was the most common thing.
And that skunk one produces citrus and floral, right?
Yeah.
And sometimes cheesy.
Lots of grape.
And grape, you know, and never anything skunky.
Yes.
No burnt rubber, no burnt tires, no rank, no nothing.
That Sam spent 15, 20 years of his life doing his damnedest
to make sure it didn't smell like that ever.
Yeah.
And he did a really good job.
He did the best job.
You know?
And so now it's like, I mean, I don't want real,
I'm not really trying to like call it out
or anything like that.
But, you know, like for instance,
when the Swamp Boys first came out.
Yeah.
You know, they had a couple of different plants
that they bred to everything.
And one of them was skunk one.
Yeah.
So rather than calling it, oh, we got some skunk one.
They're like, oh, we got the skunky thing.
We call it orange blossom trail.
And it's got notes of sweet citrus
and it's an old Florida skunk.
Well, you know, skunk one throws citrus.
Yeah.
So they got some skunk one.
They found a good male.
They, you know, they crossed it to things.
Todd, who I got into an argument with
is trying to sell ancient skunk one beans and hope.
And he's trying to sell hope that you're going to find
that lost skunk terp in there.
Well, he saw it worked with dominion.
So he's like, I'm going to do that too.
I mean that.
Oh, wait, your audio.
Can you guys still hear Natsu?
Yeah, there you are.
There you are.
I'm back.
So that's the same thing too, right?
Where it's like, we should maybe,
we don't have to talk about the whole thing.
Yeah.
But we can talk about something pretty basic
is that, you know, Duke came out with this
ancient Virginia skunk from the mountain men of the hills.
And these guys bred.
For SSSE.
These guys bred skunk for SSSE.
They were the American breeders for SSSE.
Yeah.
All this and that, you know,
and that he inherited these beans from his uncle.
And this is what he started, you know,
dominion seeds and crossing everything too, right?
Sure.
So later on, Matt and I got the opportunity,
which I think was super cool to talk to the head guy
from SSSE.
Sure.
And we got a, I don't know if a bunch of people
put that together, but like we got to ask him directly,
did you ever work with any Americans?
Did any, did you do any breeding in America?
Were there any people breeding for you in America
and sending you seeds?
Yeah.
You know, where did you get skunk one so and so?
Did you have people from America even mailing seeds?
All kinds.
And he said, never, no.
Didn't exist.
Didn't have any.
And all skunk one comes from Sam.
Yeah.
And he said that specifically,
all his skunk one came directly from Sam.
All his skunk one came directly from Sam.
So, you know, I don't know, I don't know where,
I don't know where Duke got his skunk one,
but it's all the same skunk one.
There is no secret breeder for skunk one.
Yeah.
It all, you people who breed, who have skunk one,
they bought kilos from Sam.
Sam would not sell to the public.
He didn't want to have what happened in Neville.
And so, but he would wholesale to other retailers in Holland
because that was legal.
Yes.
Because seed sales were legal.
So he would wholesale his,
he gave a ton of seed to Positronics and to Neville
and to SSSC and later to the Flying Dutchman
and I'm sure Seedsman and so on and so on and so on
and so forth.
Oh yeah, yeah.
And everyone tries to claim
that they have some ancient rare,
oh, we've got the Sam skunk one
from before it wasn't skunky.
Before Sam even touched that shit.
Oh, we've got the, oh no.
And then, you know, you got this,
you got whatever his ass name is, fucking Leo Stone.
Yeah.
Claiming that like, oh, they've got skunk bud
from, you know, from brick weed
that got sent to France in 71,
four or five years before Sam even started working
on skunk one.
Yeah, French connection, bro.
Well, you know, I mean, you know what brick weed
sent to Europe was?
It was probably Colombian or Mexican.
Yeah, exactly.
Nobody was making hybrids in homegrown
and bricking it up and mailing it across the ocean.
So everyone tries to come out with these ancient, you know.
Yeah, I mean, he did.
He said it came from his fam.
NBA, the guy that we, his uncle.
And his uncle and all that, you know.
And so I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to diss anybody.
I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to like straight say
that all these different people say they have
rare, unusual, secret skunk one.
It's all the same skunk one.
It's all citrus, you know, cheese, floral, grape, you know.
People breed with it because it improves bud structure
and it improves calyx to leaf ratio.
Yeah.
It makes plants look nicer.
It's decent, especially if you haven't ever
experienced skunk one.
I'm sure it's unique and decent.
That's why it's in so many lines today.
It was a revelation because when Sam brought it to Europe,
it was, it bred true for any number of different traits
and you could get four or five pounds off it in a greenhouse.
Yep.
And they were dealing with all these weird sativas
and all these things that didn't want to finish
in their area and it was Northern Europe and shitty.
And he brought skunk one there
and it literally was a revolution.
But people acting like skunk one,
is there some secret skunk one?
Everyone using skunk one is using the absolute most common
oldest breeding technique in the book.
Yeah.
Which is consumers like buds that have nice bud structure
and nice calyx to leaf ratio.
Skunk one does this.
I'm going to take a male skunk at one
and I'm going to cross it to everything.
Yeah.
And then I got to concoct some rare special stories
so people don't see it as the same shit
that everyone else has been doing for forever.
Yeah.
And that's the seed business folks.
That's how it runs.
Yeah. I mean, that's the seed business.
And so you got to add floral language to it.
And so right now Todd is trying to make it seem
like the same skunk one that's been available
from Sam to everyone is some rare and unusual
and secret skunk that's been released from the eighties.
It's all the same stuff.
Yeah.
It's all from the same dude.
And it's probably the same shit that's in your cookies,
that's in a shirt, that's in all of it.
It's been from the same dude forever.
And if it's not from the same dude,
it's because somebody bought a bunch of that dude's stuff
and bred it themselves.
And just to make more seed.
But they didn't do anything specific to it.
It's all skunk one.
Yeah.
You know?
And so one thing we do know about skunk one, right?
Is that there's all kinds of people we know
that have ran large amounts of skunk one.
Yeah.
Hunting for skunk turps.
And they just don't exist.
Yeah.
Not happening.
There is some stuff that there was some things
in the eighties that people got that they crossed.
And even in the eighties,
they never got skunk one to be skunky.
Yeah.
They had to cross it to something else to get it to pop.
Yeah.
And it was also skunky to get that skunk turk to pop.
Like Neville took skunk one and threw it on maple leaf
and he got super skunk.
You know, there was a few different things in the nineties,
but now it's like, people are just, it's like the same,
you know, I don't, it's like fashion or whatever, right?
It's like the same regurgitated shit.
And it's like, oh, there's a new generation
that doesn't know.
Let's resell them the exact same thing,
but let's butter it up.
What's cool though, is that now with so many more people
making seeds, so many more people able to grow
instead of it being like a cycle of every 10, five years,
now it's like every two years, every one year,
every six months.
Oh yeah.
And there was that guy, what was his,
I don't even want to say his name,
was it Blue or Scott?
There's other people out there that sell, you know,
there's another guy that had Uncle Fester skunk,
everyone, all these rare skunks, right?
All this, you know, you're right.
Skunk one is that,
but I've got this one hook that gave me
this ancient rare skunk one from before it went fruity.
Yeah.
And I'm going to sell it to you now.
Before it went to Amsterdam.
You know?
Yeah.
And so it's, so the sulfur,
someone's asking about the sulfur talk.
Todd McCormick made this post that maybe people
weren't getting skunky smells anymore
because they weren't using sulfur burners as much.
Yeah, because people don't use sulfur burners anymore.
I kind of took it as like a bunch of people
were buying his skunk and not finding any skunk
and getting upset about it because it's not in skunk one.
And so he's trying to ruminate
on what could be the difference, right?
Yeah.
And it's not like any of the skunk one stuff.
Here's the other thing people should know
is that Sam Skunkman has been on every fucking forum
since forums started for weed.
Yes.
Cannabis World, Overgrow, IC Mag.
Yeah, he name it, yeah.
He has been spouting his version of events
for like 30 years.
Yes.
He's been writing it down.
It's no secret.
You can add, the dude himself will sit there
and lay out exactly what he did and why
and why you won't find what you're looking for.
You know?
Yeah.
But people want to make it,
people want to make it seem like,
and that's what's kind of coming right now
is everyone was like five, 10, 15 years ago,
I saw a buddy joke that like,
you couldn't give away gypsy Nirvana skunk one seeds
15 years ago.
Yeah, no, you couldn't.
Couldn't give them away
because people knew what they were
and they were like, no, I don't really want that.
Yeah.
You know?
So, I mean, that's, but that's what's happening
is now, you know, you can segue to it or whatever
and it's the same thing with sour.
It's the same, like all these old things
that have name recognition.
But a lot of people don't have personal experience
with them are gonna repackaged
and unscrupulous people are gonna like, you know,
sell you hopes and dreams, you know?
Yeah, that's how it goes.
And that's a big part of it is,
they're relying on people not to have had experience
with it in the first place.
And they're relying on all this,
knowing that it's very likely a lot of people
aren't gonna have that experience with it.
So how the fuck are you gonna tell them it's not that?
And that's never stopped existing in the seed world.
No, I don't think so.
I mean, they, you know, and just so people know,
it's like, I see people saying,
we should talk about that too,
running Todd's, Puris, Indica and L5.
You know, we, I shouldn't say we,
Matt did an interview with the guy,
basically the head guy that kind of created NL
and his group of friends and his little group of growers
or whatever, kind of is the reason why NL is so famous.
And they sent Neville and Sensi a bunch of seed
and the rest is kind of history.
And after, I believe it was after he did that interview
with you, he found some seed and he sent some seed to you,
right Matt, directly.
And then he also sent some seed to Todd.
Yes, at the same time.
At the same time.
And so, you know, it's not Todd's anything.
Todd got it sent to him from, you know,
Todd got it sent to him from Greg, you know,
and the stuff that CSI and Matt and, you know,
this kind of little collab thing that's been going on,
that's all the same seed stock that Todd got,
but we got it from the same person.
Yeah.
The main thing was that like,
there seemed like there was gonna be a race to pop them,
to get them out there.
And I didn't wanna do that.
I wanted to make sure that they could all be popped
at one time, because why just look through four or five
in your closet and then do a repo from that
when you can do, you know, 80 of them.
So we decided to wait until it was time,
until we had the space to do it.
And luckily, CSI Humboldt provided that.
And luckily we pulled it off.
And CSI, you know, he's really experienced.
He's got a really good numbering system.
He's got a really good note-taking system.
He's got a really good way of identifying, you know,
different traits and different things
that might be of interest.
And, you know, yeah, someone just talked about,
could you talk about the Gypsy Nirvana era?
That whole movie and just that whole era,
that's probably a whole show in itself.
Yeah.
That's a wild show.
Yeah.
That's a wild show, but even his era
and everything that was going on then,
I mean, we could talk for, that's a,
there was a lot going on then.
Yeah, we could bring Chimera on for something like that.
Cause he was, you know, involved heavily
into that stuff at that time.
That'd be a good one.
Somebody said, the only time I ever got a sandalwood smell
was there was this AK-47 that was sent
around the Colorado area in the nineties.
Yeah.
And it smelled extremely strong of sandalwood.
Our buddy Crybaby could probably pop in
and tell us what terpenes that is.
I'm old and I don't have whatever that is memorized, but.
Yeah, I don't have any terpene,
anything memorized myself either.
But I have some of it memorized.
I know that terpenolene smells like Jack and.
And witch hazel.
And train wreck and stuff like that, you know?
So what people are saying, NL.
So NL is like, NL is super famous because Neville
and Sensi, you know, but basically Neville made it.
So he took Seattle Greg seeds and grew up a bunch of them
and released multiple lines
and then a whole bunch of hybrids.
Yes.
Right.
And so he released NL one and NL two pure.
And then he found one female that was like a throwback plant
of NL five and that NL five mother cut, if you will,
he used extensively.
He crossed it to Hayes.
He crossed it to skunk one.
He crossed it to NL two.
It was in the poly, a lot of the poly hybrids he sold.
It was in there.
Yeah.
So it kind of bubbled up and got super famous.
Steve Murphy was involved with NL in the sense
that his Afghani seeds given to Greg is the beginning of NL.
And the story behind that was a lady
that Steve Murphy knew went through the hippie hash trail
through the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan
and collected seeds.
And they don't really know if it's an Afghani or a Paki
to be sure, but she's the one who brought them back
for Steve Murphy.
And he gave some of those seeds out
and they made their way into the NL, the base for NL.
The base for NL.
And so, yeah, I mean, and then those guys all got busted
in the late eighties.
And Greg basically said if he hadn't sent them to Europe
they probably all would have been lost.
Yeah.
And Neville was one of the only breeders
selling seeds back then.
So the stuff that he was selling became immensely popular.
I think, and then there was other people,
was it Dutch Passion that sold NL2 as Oasis?
Yes, yes.
That was a Dutch Passion.
So there was other people that got Neville seeds
or Sensi seeds and white labeled them
or made their own crosses.
And then, so one thing that we should say is Skunk One
and NL and all that is in almost everything.
It's in a lot of today's work.
It's just generations past.
Yeah.
You know?
So, I mean, that's kind of how I see it is like-
Yeah, NL, Skunk and Hazer and so much.
So much.
And so it's like, you might not, people,
younger people today might not have like much access
to them pure.
Right?
But they, I mean, their grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
polyhybrids from them are all over the place.
Their fingerprints are everywhere.
And that's partially America's fault
because we give fucking nicknames to everything.
Yeah, it really is.
We do, we give nicknames to everything.
So you start giving nicknames to thing in your crew
and then only the nickname becomes known
and then you don't know what seeds it was.
You don't know what it came from.
You know?
I mean, so it's like, you can, we could,
somebody asked about the dog shit.
The dog shit was called,
the dog shit got named that Norgan.
In Minnesota where it was popped,
it was called Electric Boogaloo.
Such a better name.
Such a better name, way cooler name.
And it's also very, very, very, very likely
that it's an NL5 Haze from the early nineties.
But you buy some NL5 Haze from the early nineties
and you pop a seed and you like it
and it gives you a great buzz
and you call it Electric Boogaloo
and then you send it out to Oregon
and some idiot calls it dog shit
and then now it's a dog shit.
Someone, Arizona Regenerative keeps asking
about Granddaddy Perp.
So the basic story of Granddaddy Perp
is that it's an Urkel hybrid or rename,
whether it came from Ken or whoever else.
The surviving cuts all are based on Urkel.
And most people that have both cuts
chose to go with the original, which was Urkel.
Yeah, that's just a rough rundown on it.
And there's something, I mean,
there's a lot more I could add to that one,
but one of the things that's interesting about it
is that for as popular as Urkel became,
there's, I mean, there's people out there
that wanna claim the mantle,
but there really still isn't a verifiable,
believable Urkel origin story.
No, there isn't.
And it's one of the few cuts that got that famous
that the story or information hasn't popped up.
It really is still a mystery.
And there's been people like CSI and myself and others
who have literally been hunting for what it is
for 20 plus years.
Yeah.
There's a lot of claimants, but none of them hold any gas.
It hasn't seemed to hold any water.
Yeah, water.
And so that, when Urkel came out and became super famous,
that was like what I call the purple craze, right?
And so that Urkel, granddaddy purple,
grape ape, purple dragon,
all that different types of stuff,
Mimindo perps, all that stuff became super famous.
And some of those names, I'm sure are renames.
Some of them are bag seeds.
Yeah.
Some of them are just, well, if I call it grape ape,
I can claim it as my croups and I can take it down to,
and back then it was like all that weed was going through
a lot of the dispensaries in the Bay area,
just limitless amounts.
Yeah.
And so Trapmouth Blast pointed out,
there's skunk in S1 progeny of Urkel.
And yeah, even if you have the clone
or some of the hybrids or S1s in veg,
if you take cuts of it,
it smells like skunk spray everywhere.
It doesn't pop up very regularly,
but it's definitely in there.
And, you know, I mean, at the time that it was found,
I mean, it kind of started spreading a lot
in the early 2000s.
Yeah.
That's right on the tail end of all that skunk
and everything, skunk one and everything.
Yeah.
But it wouldn't be surprising at all that it would have,
whether it's a polyhybrid or whether it's a skunk one
or skunk one hybrid that got mixed
to something local up here,
but it's one of the few strains that got that famous
that like there really hasn't been a verifiable story.
I think the only thing accurate that I've ever heard
about it that sounds accurate at least
is that it's Paki skunk one or Afghani skunk one.
I could totally see it, you know?
Yeah.
But that's trailed along with it all throughout
its little life and what people say.
So it's just interesting that we got that much.
There's a lot of stuff we could go into
well thought out hypotheticals.
Yeah.
That's a deep one.
Yeah.
You know, there's a difference between,
and I try to like, I try when I talk to people
to like differentiate when I'm,
I think I'm talking in like actual fact.
Yeah.
And when you're venturing into like educated guesses
or what the plants told you,
or you're stringing together a story
from bits and pieces that you know, you know?
Yeah.
So, you know,
I mean, definitely, yeah.
I mean, the guy said there's definitely Afghan.
Like it definitely doesn't have very much stretch.
Yeah.
No.
Urkel was always one of those ones where you get it
to about the size you want it to be and then you flip it.
Yeah.
It's not gonna grow all that much.
One of my favorite Urkel hybrids has always been
the Urkel trade dog that High and Lonesome did.
There was so much skunkiness in that fucking line.
He killed it.
CSI has one, I mean, TK by Urkel.
Yeah.
And that's what that T1000 came from or whatever, you know?
Yeah.
And that stuff added a little bit of potency
and a little different kick to it.
I liked that one quite a bit, you know?
Yeah.
So, I mean, but yeah, I mean,
what irritates me is that there's a lot of like,
I don't even know how to put it,
but the weed game seems like it reinvents itself
every five or 10 years.
Yeah.
Right?
And so as a result of that, you keep getting,
this is what makes Matt so mad,
is you keep getting people coming out
with the same tired scams,
but ready for a new batch of people
that haven't heard them yet.
Yeah.
And the same bullshit stories.
And there's some people, I mean, there was some shit,
somebody posted New York City kid or whatever.
Oh.
And that dude's had like nine different monikers.
And he's still around.
Spewing bull on various aspects of things.
And so-
My favorite, I just wanna say my favorite
was when he pretended to be an old lady
who was married to a man who just passed
that carried the Asian fantasy.
That was my favorite.
Oh, yeah.
My favorite NYC kid one.
And so, yeah, you know, Rascal,
there's an era there from like,
like that was more Matt's era than mine
because I was having kids and wrapped up
and living in the hills then.
But Rascal in 08, 09, 10, 11,
like he put out a bunch of fire.
Yeah, he crushed it.
Like Rascal, I, you know,
it's a shame he still doesn't too much,
but he had a three or four or five year period there
where everything he was releasing was good.
Yeah.
And he was one of the first people
along with Matt and a few others
who was actually successfully reversing things.
Yeah.
So he, I don't know if he gets enough credit.
No, he predated me too.
So he was, he was an early wave
of revolutionizing how we breed.
Yeah.
And people found a lot of fire
in a lot of his lines from back then.
Matic, you still got, you still got some Rascal gear?
Hook it up.
Yeah. I mean, Matt, Matt and I actually,
it was probably six or seven months ago.
We were looking through,
we were looking through a seed list of a friend of mine
who was getting rid of his seed freezer.
Right?
Yeah.
And it was basically all from say 07 to 2012.
Yeah. Yeah.
Roughly. Yeah.
It was roughly all right in that range.
And it was amazing how little of any of those things
you could still buy today from anyone.
Oh yeah.
Most of that's gone.
Most of that was, and that's only 10 years,
10, 12 years ago.
And then you go back another five or 10 years
and that stuff's gone.
And you go back in the nineties and that shit's gone.
Yep.
You know, and so yeah, Rascal, I give him a bunch of credit
because you know, he bred a bunch of fire
and he was one of the first people to kind of start
the new Asian fantasy is some shit
that Jason King put in his can of Bible.
And he said it was one of the best strains
he'd ever smoked.
And it was a crazy satirical,
and I think that can of Bible entry
and how highly he talked about it
created a massive demand for it.
And then that.
It was unique looking.
And that created a forum and internet scam opportunity.
Sure did.
Same with HP 13 and everything else.
Yeah.
And so, you know, that kind of thing,
like back before IG and all that,
like the forums,
that was where you scammed people over the internet.
Yeah.
You know, and so there was a lot of Asian fantasy rumors.
Asian fantasy is one of those weird things
where everybody that talks about it,
nobody's really smoked it.
The only person I know who's actually smoked Asian fantasy
and knows the one guy who's kept it
and is gonna die with it is Bodhi.
And he knows the dude.
And apparently obviously he's a fan of Asian fantasy.
And he knows the dude.
And apparently obviously Jason King smoked it
and loved it enough to write like super eloquent,
you know, write ups about how amazing it was.
But then that dude wouldn't share it either.
No.
So yeah.
And that's really what it is.
It's like every five or 10 years,
everything that was available isn't available.
Yeah.
You know.
People are talking about Top Dog and the blue Asian.
In fairness, NYC Kid scammed a lot of people
and he was the guy who scammed with the blue Asian.
It happened to everyone during that.
I mean, I was friends with the dude
for like two or three years and he pulled the long con.
So it could happen to anyone,
especially during those times.
Everybody gets, I mean, one of the things about cannabis
is that since it's not documented very well, most of it,
you know, you can walk out of the shadows
and start claiming a bunch of shit.
Yeah.
Like, you know, my uncles grew Super Sativa Seed Club,
Skunk One and bred for them in the 80s
in the hills of Virginia.
Yeah.
Or I found Asian Fantasy and we did this.
Or I, you know, you just, whatever story.
There's still today people walking out with stories.
Yeah.
Because who's gonna, and they don't even care
if 10% of us know it's bullshit.
Yeah, no, I mean, Leo Stone's the perfect example.
If I'm gonna use a name, just couldn't give less of a fuck
that it doesn't align with history
and that a lot of people are gonna know he's a liar.
He's gonna know that most people
won't be able to counter that.
That guy said it straight up
and he was totally accurate in what he said.
He didn't give a fuck.
Yeah.
Because his seed releases sellout.
Yeah, that's exactly what matters.
He has a goal.
He reaches that goal.
The haters or whatever, I don't even like that term really,
but like all the people that call him out
and all the bullshit and everything like that,
he doesn't care because it drives drama and he sells out.
I mean, there was this thing the other day
where he came out with like his stupid sour diesel cross
that's full of shit or whatever, that one.
And it was like limited to three,
it says it all over it, limited to 300 packs.
And then this guy gets a pack
and it's like stamped number 399.
Yeah.
You know, so I mean, it just is, we're rife for scammers.
Yeah.
And we're rife for selling legends and selling hope.
You know, and Todd McCormick or whatever,
he does get his seeds from real people.
He just doesn't add any of the nuance to it
that you think people would want.
You know, he just wants you to believe
it's like walking into the seed bank in 1986
and plopping down money, same thing.
When obviously it's not.
One second, I'm gonna give this to Benny Bag of Beans
in the next two minutes if anybody else wants to get on it.
It's the Banana Tie F1s, which is the juicy fruit
crossed to Platinum Banana OGBX1
and the perfect pearl crossed to Blue Bonnet,
which is the silver berries.
So if you wanna get on it, get on it now
or I'm just gonna, I'm gonna push it off
in the next two minutes to Benny.
And thanks for everyone who's participated so far.
Somebody's saying Todd is cool.
I don't know Todd personally.
I've never had a cross with Todd.
He might have issues or whatever.
Like, you know, there's a lot of people that know him.
I was just making a comment in the sense that
like you call your seed company Authentic Genetics.
You go to great pains to say it's all from the original,
the original lines from the original breeders.
And you make a bunch of people think it's like unchanged,
kept by the right guys from the 80s
and nothing ever happened to it.
And it's not the case.
Yeah.
It's not the case.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, my biggest problem when we first butted heads
was the whole Prop 64 thing,
which leads to where we're at now.
You know, like we're dying.
Our whole community's dying.
And a lot of that can be pointed back to Prop 64,
which Todd was a big proponent of
because he had a lot of rich friends
and he wanted to push that through.
Yeah, I mean, Todd can talk about what a,
you know, a weed warrior he's been.
And while I do have sympathy for anybody
who's been jailed or suffered,
because myself and others have all gone through it.
For sure.
I didn't live in Beverly Hills at the time,
nor did I move back to Beverly Hills when I was done.
So there's a level of like wealth there.
You didn't have Woody Harrelson bailing you out of-
No, I didn't live in Beverly Hills.
You know, I didn't have any mansions.
Yeah.
For the cause.
Most people didn't have mansions for the cause.
Yeah, that's true.
You know, they had trap houses
and you grew in shitty neighborhoods
where they didn't wanna bother you.
Yeah.
Because you weren't a problem.
And you grew on the, you know,
you were growing on the outskirts.
You grew on the edges.
You know, I mean, most people,
Mendo and Humboldt became famous
because it had a good climate,
but also because people could disappear into the hills
and get away with it, you know?
Oh, that's interesting.
I didn't know if anybody had asked him,
Project Seed Monster,
how many males and females he used
in his NL5 reproduction line.
Yeah, I've only heard from his-
So I'll say this about that,
is that if you wanna get NL from Greg,
then you can get it from Matt through CSI, right?
And CSI has whole pictures of his rooms,
breeding, updates, this, that, everything else.
It's all pretty well documented, right?
Yeah.
And who knows how much or little Todd has done.
Yeah.
You know, you can see how big CSI did it.
Yeah.
You know, you could see that he was blowing off whole rooms.
Yeah.
And he's made selections
and he's done all this different stuff.
And it's, you know, we have a mutual buddy
that's pictures, pictures are a dozen count.
Yep.
You know, which I don't think is too true
when you go back far enough,
because it was risky then, but for now, Jesus.
Yeah, we're actually doing a run of the clones
of the seed moms, even though we've already pollinated all
and we kept clones of every single male and female
to see how they flower as clones.
So we know that, you know,
if we're saying this one's gonna be bubble gummy
from this specific one,
we'll know that it's actually bubble gummy as a clone
and can pass on said traits.
So yeah, there's a lot more involved
that people have no clue about yet.
Yeah.
I don't think anybody is gonna recreate NL5 Hayes.
I mean, it would be nice.
We're doing some interesting stuff,
but it would be nice.
It would be a straight NL5 Hayes,
because I don't think any of us are rocking
just straight original Hayes,
because it would take a big pop of old original Hayes
in the first place to find a pheno worth breeding with.
And then you got to hope that it passes
on any of the traits.
But we are doing some crosses with the NL5 stuff
that will be similar to a NL5 cross to NL5 Hayes,
something like that.
And the only-
I wasn't even trying to diss it,
because basically what you're saying is,
is cross an extreme sativa to an indica.
Yeah.
And hopefully find something.
I just personally think that NL5 Hayes
is probably the single most successful
release seed line in history.
Mr. Toad has an original.
Don't even start me on Mr. Toad.
So, I mean, here's the thing about original Hayes,
is that original Hayes is also not rare.
It's also easily available.
It all comes from the same dude, just like Skunk One.
It comes from Sam Skunkman, right?
And he has sold kilos of that.
You used to be able to buy pure Hayes F10
in the 90s from the Flying Dutchman.
And they would have big write-ups on it.
You could get pure Hayes from Seedsman.
You could get pure Hayes from all over the place.
Yeah.
It's not rare.
It's not hard to find.
What is hard to find is it does seem
that the Hayes seeds that Neville got,
and Positronics got,
and SSSC got in the mid 80s,
they found phenos that were much easier
to create quality with
than after Sam had done multiple OPs, open pollinations.
So, there's a, you know, you could like,
I'm not, what Matt is basically saying is that
the amount of work it would take to find the type of Hayes
that Neville found is really hard.
Yeah.
Because open pollination is a great thing,
but it really opens it up,
which means you have to hunt through so much more.
I do know that Scabby and White Buffalo
have some really good Hayes
they've been showing off and crossing.
So, I think that maybe that'll be a cool project.
Use one of their Hayes selections
and cross with the NL5.
That's a definite possibility.
Tom Hill's Hayes is from Positronics stock.
And Danny, we are bidding on the Banana Tie F1
and the Silverberries right now.
Somebody said, what is Super Skunk?
Super Skunk was a very skunky, skunk one male
that Neville crossed to Maple Leaf Indica,
he called Afghan Tee.
And it became probably the best selling thing at his company
and then later at Sensi.
And it was the line that popped all the skunk turps
that everybody dreams about.
Yeah.
For lack of a better way to put it.
Is there a Neville's Hayes selection?
Neville's selection of Neville's Hayes in the US?
Some people have it, I'm sure.
Not the one that I want.
Yeah.
I will tell people if they wanna talk about Neville's Hayes
for a second.
Sure.
Is that there is a Neville's Hayes Pheno
that still floats around Europe
that is by far the strongest sativa I have ever encountered.
Neville's Hayes, especially the older Neville's Hayes
has like some effects in it
that are super uncommon in cannabis.
Yeah.
It's incredibly potent.
I hunted for mine myself.
I think we have a buddy of ours on here,
Direwolf is on here.
He got some Neville's Hayes in the late nineties
and he made bubble hash or something like that
that like lasted him 10 years.
And this stuff is wicked potent.
Yeah.
It's anxiety inducing.
It's yeah, the Fort Collins cough is an NL5.
I have some in the other room.
Yeah, the cough is, I used to grow the cough.
I used to grow the cough.
That's why I say that I think NL5 Hayes
is probably the most successful line ever released
because there's probably seven to 10 phenos of it
that still exist.
Right?
Yeah.
I mean, there's the cough, there's dog shit,
there's C5, there's the pith, there's Cuban black.
Like, I mean, you can go.
Yeah, there's endless.
And then there's a bunch of stuff of that.
And so there's like, there's probably more phenos of that.
Most things you're lucky if one pheno of a line
from that old survived.
Yeah.
And NL5 Hayes has like fricking, like I said,
it's probably got double digit elite phenos
that are like 30 years old.
Snow High, as much as I butted heads with him over the years
he had a fucking amazing, amazing devil's haze gut.
I don't know if he still holds it or not.
But if people that are looking for a good devil's haze,
if he has some of those crosses out there,
he had a purple's devil's haze male.
It was just, both selections are phenomenal.
Phenomenal.
Yeah.
I mean, it's got, you know, it's one of those things
where when you cross two marijuana strains
that are very unlike one another,
you can get some unique combinations of potency,
terps, growth, all that kind of stuff.
I hadn't heard that trout mouth.
I'll look into it.
I hope that's not the case.
So yeah, that would suck.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, seed breeders and old schoolers and stuff
we're like a can tanker.
We're like a difficult bunch.
Yes.
You know, every generation has a group
that doesn't get along.
You know, you can go back
and people will be battling each other on forums
and, you know, people have strong held beliefs, you know.
I mean, Tom Hill is an amazing contributor to cannabis,
but boy, was that dude tough to get along with.
Yeah, he's complex.
You definitely don't wanna get on his wrong side,
you know, because you'd take your head off, you know.
So I don't know, but yeah, I mean,
I don't have any idea what,
I know Top Dog, we both know Top Dog.
I don't know what he's specifically using on anything.
Aces used to be a lot more reputable.
They have some shadiness to them.
But it's indisputable that there's some dudes in Europe
and others that gave them real cuts.
They got that real cut of Neville's Haze.
I was just talking about, they have the real A5,
they got real cuts.
There's definitely some junk in their stuff,
but I mean, that's Haze.
That's just a part of using Haze.
Correll does not have his Haze still.
He has a 35-year-old cut of his Haze by Skunk One.
Yeah, the Skunk One Haze.
But he doesn't have any original breeding Hazes
or anything like that.
It is possible that the Haze C exists,
which is Neville's old breeding male.
It's possible Shanti has it, it's possible it's in Spain.
It's impossible for us to so far get any verification
other than them saying it exists.
So this is a good point, Autoflower AK.
Let me get this straight.
Neville popped a handful of Haze seeds
and found multiple gems in a bag from Sam.
But you think Sam's OPing that line
made it harder to find keepers.
That is one of those enigmas of Haze, right?
It is.
Yep, and like I said before, OPing, you can lose it too.
Yeah, absolutely.
You can OP and open pollination,
for anybody that doesn't know,
open pollination is basically taking males and females
of the same line and breeding them together
using no selection and just trying to preserve
as much genetic diversity as you can.
So Sam has been very clear over the years
for some stupid fucking reason,
he never did selective breeding with Haze.
Never.
He just decided to continually open pollinate it.
And so it seems like,
and we actually learned some pretty interesting stuff
from Carell in that Sam probably didn't have
that many Haze seeds when he came over
because he gave, according to Carell,
he only gave 10 or 15 to Positronics.
He only got 10-ish.
Neville only, like there was,
so maybe he only brought over some
and he kept some from himself.
And it does seem like that everyone
that got those original Haze seeds from Sam
before he had a chance to do anything with them in Europe,
that's where all the Haze comes from,
pretty much, for whether it's-
Yeah, yeah.
Positronics is where Tom Hill
or old timers Haze comes from.
Carell had some, Neville had some.
Sam still did open pollinate,
but then no one has really found any elites
or anything from those open pollinations
that they bred into things, to my knowledge.
I'm not saying it's not in there,
but when you have a situation where most of the line
is gonna go 16 to 24 weeks,
and they're admitting that 80% of it is junk,
and 10% of it is nice, and 10% is special,
finding that 10% that's special is hard.
Yes, it is.
Finding a breeding male
that is going to pass those special traits
is even fucking harder.
They got lucky, for lack of a better term.
Yeah, and realistically, Neville,
with whatever he was given,
he obviously did a better selection
based on either luck, chance, or what have you.
And the continuous open pollination with Sam
basically opened the lineup so much,
you will not run into the same phenotype like that
very often, which is why you're probably seeing
high amounts of variation and not running into the keepers.
And there's another interesting thing
that we should maybe say, too, when it comes to that,
is that there's also a theory
that a lot of the Euros didn't like haze by skunk one,
because they thought the skunk terps
dominated the haze cross,
and also skunk one is primarily sativa,
so it was a sativa-leaning plant
crossed with a pure sativa.
Some people think that the reason
why Neville had such success with it
is because he was able to cross it
to very different indicas.
G13, Northern Lights,
and a lot of his most famous hash plant,
and there's phenos of those that all,
there's hash plant haze, G13 haze, NL5 haze,
they all still exist.
So some of it could be that he just had
some nicer Afghans that blended better.
That could be it, too.
There's people that believe that pretty strongly.
Yeah.
That maybe the things he was crossing it to was just nicer.
And it's also possible, we don't have a lot of,
we don't have a lot of,
I mean, do we have a bunch of cross-referencing
from Sam's early era, Matt?
Of what?
Of just about what he was up to and what he was doing.
I mean, that was one of the most,
the longest- Not cross-referencing.
And most angry part of the forums.
Remember when he was know-it-all for sure?
Yeah, he had a few names.
Yeah, he had a few different names,
and people would argue over whether or not
he was the neighbor to the Haze brothers,
what he knew, whether it was true.
The one guy, and it makes sense,
because back then only your good friends
would know you were growing.
Rob Clark, who I respect a lot, backs him up.
But they've been best buddies for 40 years.
Yeah.
There's people that think that he stumbled upon Skunk One,
it was already kind of mixed,
and he just kind of finished it.
He claims he started it.
We have his version of events.
And we don't have, there might be other aspects of it,
but it could be even that Haze and Skunk
had similar ancestors somewhere.
Yeah.
Because Haze was pure Columbian.
Yeah.
And so maybe it didn't cross as well as the pure Afghans.
Neville and Shanti did make Super Sober Haze together.
I could tell that story because it's pretty cool.
When Neville was in jail in 1990,
somebody grew out some NL5 by Skunk Haze seeds.
NL5 Haze by Skunk Haze seeds.
And they found this crazy pheno
that became super popular in Europe.
And when he got out of jail, he started breeding it.
And he wanted to breed it.
He wanted to find, he was trying to blend
the three most famous European seed bank lines together.
Northern Lights, Skunk, Haze.
He was trying to find some combo, right?
And he wasn't that happy with it.
So he bred it for four or five years or whatever.
And then Ben and Alan Dronkers, who owned Scentsy,
by that time he was working, he was their head breeder
because they bailed him out of jail and bought his company
when he was in a tight spot,
which he had eternal resentment for.
Because basically it's like, they kind of were like,
we'll get you out of prison and get you back into Holland,
but you have to give us all your shit.
Yeah.
And so he, and then they hired him
and he went from being a business owner
of the largest seed company in Holland to the head breeder
and had to give them all his work.
Yep.
But be that as it may,
the first Cannabis Cup I went to in 1995
was named after Jack Herrera.
The whole thing was themed after
the emperor wears no clothes.
Jack was there, they were doing all this shit
about hemp was gonna save the world.
And Ben and Alan Dronkers being money oriented Dutch people,
they wanted to release a Jack Herrera strain.
Yeah.
And so they, Neville said it wasn't ready.
They said, I don't care.
And they released Jack Herrera,
which was his NL five Hayes by skunk Hayes hybrid.
Yeah.
And then after he left,
after he broke up with Sensey
and went on and did his own thing,
he started working with Shanti who was younger than him
and probably a little bit more vibrant
and had a little bit more like verve to get going
then than he did.
Yeah.
And then they started working under greenhouse
and they started breeding a Hayes project,
which after two or three years of work,
I think became Super Silver Hayes,
Mango Hayes and Neville's Hayes.
That's correct.
Yep.
And Super Silver Hayes was Neville's preference.
Mango Hayes was Shanti's preference.
Same father, different mother type of thing.
So half sisters, I guess.
And then Neville's Hayes was only supposed to be
a personal project, right?
Yeah.
It was only supposed to be a personal breeding project
for his Holy Grail.
The Grail that he never stopped chasing.
And that, yeah, that Holy Grail.
And then they found such fire in it at first
that they ended up releasing it.
Yeah.
And everybody that got those first few years of releases,
there was crazy sativa power in that weed.
Yeah.
And that was kind of the tail end of Neville's
kind of like intense contributions to breeding.
Yeah.
Mango Hayes, Super Silver Hayes and Neville's Hayes
were kind of like the last three big things that he did.
Yeah.
He did some small releases and some other different things
under some different groups and with some different help,
like from, what's dude's name?
Kenga?
Kenga, yeah.
Yeah.
And he definitely did some stuff,
but the last thing that really became like world famous,
right?
Like Super Silver Hayes was fucking famous.
It won like three cannabis cups in a row.
It was like, you know, it was famous.
Yeah.
Super famous.
So yeah.
What about the Outback?
I mean, yeah, the Outback is another one of those.
I mean, lots of people have the Mango Hayes.
Top Dog has Mango Hayes.
You can get Mango Hayes still straight from Mr. Nice.
Yeah.
It's still available.
It's still available.
Top Dog is bred with some Mango Hayes, you know?
So, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like,
you just wonder, do the parents,
are the parents still the same?
Yeah.
And you don't get a lot of honesty.
No, no, not with that dude.
Not with any dude.
Damn, that's right.
That's true.
Who the fuck is honest?
Not with any dudes, you're right.
I mean, which, tell me which like guy
has a fire line that got famous that was like,
oh yeah, that shit was famous.
Sucks I lost the parents.
Me.
American dudes.
American dudes.
American dudes that are stupid as fuck admit that shit.
Yeah.
So the LA cut is definitely a diesel.
Someone's asking if it's a sour cut.
It was sold as sour in my area for a long time.
It's definitely diesel type.
I wish I, I was hoping with,
I don't even wanna say their name,
but I was hoping with the scammy genetics company
that burned everyone,
that we would finally get to see relationships
and see mom, dad, cousins, nephews, aunts, uncles,
and all that.
And it would like really clarify a bunch of stuff.
But, you know, what happened to my dudded skunk six?
That's a real shame.
So in 2017, there was huge fires in my area.
It was sort of the start of the last four or five years
of every season has massive fires.
And like the second or third biggest fire
in Mendo history took off.
And I got evacuated from my spot for about a week
and I lost all five skunk six moms.
God damn it.
It was, it was, that was a rough week.
It was very difficult.
So fires, you know, there's been really bad fires
the last four or five years up in Sonoma,
Humboldt, Mendo, Trinity.
And Mandelbrot did have the rear.
So that's a, that's another long story, dude.
But Mandel, I gave, I, yes, Mandelbrot.
I gave Mandelbrot sour diesel.
He had real sour.
He did.
Is skunk six also Humboldt snow or is that five?
Skunk six is definitely not Humboldt snow.
That's skunk five.
They called, they called Humboldt snow skunk five
in Florida.
I actually, the girl who, whose boyfriend
and her brought it out to California
actually lives not very far from me.
And it made it to Eugene in glassblower circles.
And it was called snow.
Yeah.
A lot of people called it Eugene snow
because it was from those Eugene glassblowers.
It got brought down to our buddy CSI.
And if you got it in Humboldt, it was Humboldt snow.
Yeah.
So it went from skunk five to Eugene snow
to Oregon snow to Humboldt snow.
And depending on who you got it from,
one of those names would be the name you attributed to it.
So is the res cut is my headband is in the root beer.
You don't know that.
That's such a fucking shenanigans.
You don't know that.
That's that, I mean, that's what he says.
So he tentative.
He says that's the cut that was used.
What's up Lindsey?
And I will say that in some of the hybrids
that CSI released, people have found root beer turps.
Yes, that is correct.
There have been some root beer turps
that have popped up in the LATK and the LAD.
So it is possible.
Rez is a scumbag.
He was an asshole as our buddy High and Lonesome can attest.
He was an asshole on the forums
before all the shenanigans happened with the police.
I have no idea if he had the real sour diesel.
He's on the East Coast.
Yell does have a lot of super skunk like traits
that come out of it.
I can't, I'm not even dissing it.
I'm just saying that like, I didn't know him back then.
I mean, I knew of him, you know,
but like we lived on different coasts.
Yeah.
Well, it's not like we were in the same hood
or the same homies or ever saw his grow room
or I ever smoked any of his fucking weed.
Snowcap is not snow bud.
Snowcap was a large yielding Indica,
but it's not related to snow.
So yeah, there's a guy here saying multiple LA
by D Finos had root beer and as turps.
Snowcap was being grown on any Leps farm back in the day.
I used to live about a mile from Eddie Leps farm.
I used to go out there all the time.
And yeah, I stopped when he decided to buy seven acres
across in the 20 and higher loations.
And he was gonna grow 32,000 plants.
And I told him, I'm like, dude, if you do this,
you know, the DEA is like, Oh three, I think, or something.
I'm like, they'll never let you get away with it.
Yeah.
They'll never ever let you get a view.
They will come after you.
They can't let you get away with it.
Yeah.
And they didn't.
He put out 32 or 33,000 plants.
And it was actually interesting the way he did it.
People should know that he got medical cards
for every six plants and he had a fucking grid map.
He had a map of his whole property
where you got a 10 by 10 and six plants.
And it was all numbered.
And every single one of those 32,000 plants
had a fucking medical card attached to it
with six plants and a 10 by 10.
That is funny.
And he had a plan to have these all up and down California.
Yeah.
And it was going to be Eddie Lep Farms
and you are going to be able to,
you can grow your legal six plants,
but maybe you live in a city and you can't.
Yeah.
You can grow them out at Eddie's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you could actually like at Eddie Lep's farm,
you could go out there and you could go out there.
You could default.
He would do a certain amount of work
and a certain amount of basic food and this and that.
You know, there's some shadiness to it.
Let's be real, but you know, but you could.
And he did give a lot of stuff to patients
and he got ego,
he got kind of his ego into his head and they busted him.
Yeah.
And he got 10 years.
His wife died in prison, I believe with cancer.
And then he got out and he was sick
and everybody was growing the size
that he had the balls to grow.
Yeah.
And not getting in trouble for it.
So he was, yeah, he used to live in Upper Lake.
I drive past his house that he used to have often.
Up there on the hill.
Yeah.
You know, and he, I still have signed pictures of,
cause back then a field of weed was like,
you had to be up on Spirock
or you had to be out somewhere in the sticks.
Yeah.
For someone to grow something like that.
You know, the real Trinity does have some pine nose.
Skunk six was a thing.
Skunk six was the old super skunk cut
that got put into sour.
It's a long story.
We don't have, we won't chat about it here
at this minute, but skunk six and the super skunk cut
that got brought West that skunk VA post pictures
of is the same plant.
And it sounds like it was a super skunk hybrid
with the last.
It's basically the breeder.
It was a skunk.
It was a skunk hybrid that he crossed to a bunch of things.
He's kind of a rainbow hippie and not the most, you know
a lot of these old timers they're short on specifics.
Yeah.
They were doing a bunch of drugs and partying
and taking acid and tripping around
breeding things and not taking notes.
Yeah.
And then some weed nerds, 35 years later
like what were you doing?
You know, you know, what number was that?
And people are like, oh man, I don't know.
Yeah.
You know, but, but what we do know is that it was, it was
it was a skunk hybrid that he bred for a number of years.
And the final thing he did was he crossed it
to Neville's super skunk from seed.
And the, the Fino number six got sold
on dead tour a whole bunch and got, went out to Colorado
came out to California with us, became very famous.
And it was only called skunk six
by a very, very small few groups.
It was, we never called it skunk insect.
There was multiple years of debate on whether
or not the skunk six and the super skunk were the same cut.
Yeah.
It took tracking him down and having him confirm it
because all the Cali people just called it super skunk.
Yeah.
And then some of the Colorado people that were
like his old dead tour friends, some of them called it
the six.
So it's just that nickname shit again, you know?
Yep.
Why aren't the NLs after five around if they were made?
Because Greg explained it.
Neville didn't make use of him.
Yeah.
Greg explained it.
Only the one and two were mostly Indica.
They got progressively more sativa
because they were rated on height.
And I think the six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,
Neville just found to be a pain in the ass.
If you look back over his early shit
in like 86 and 87 and 88 or so,
you can see NL nine and NL eight.
You can see different ones bred into things.
And then I think by 89 or 90, he had basically decided
I'm gonna use NL one, NL two and NL five.
Yeah.
And that's it.
So those are the only ones that really got blended.
That's really all it was.
He got them in 84 or 85 and he fucked around with them
for four or five years.
And then he settled on one NL five female.
And I believe all the NL one and two he used was male.
Yeah.
For the most part, he used those as breeding kills.
I'm gonna call this auction pretty soon.
Again, get in the bids.
People have bid a little bit more.
I keep saying I'm gonna call it,
but get in your bids within the next two minutes.
And I'll call it.
This is for the banana tie F ones and the silver berries.
Okay.
What else we got?
Trinity was awesome.
I agree.
We have it today.
Still has a big ass Cola of Trinity in their freezer
from back in the day to compare to.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
And that's the hard part is all the people
that were involved with Trinity,
basically all lost it in the same two or three years.
Yeah.
And then by the time it floated back to people
15 years later, there's half the crew thinks that it's real.
And the other half thinks it's,
even the people that think it's not real,
they think it's a close hybrid.
Yeah.
Like it's got Trinity in it.
No one says it doesn't have any Trinity in it.
It's just a matter of, is it the cut I remember?
You know, and how is my memory from 1999 to now?
And God knows how much it's changed environmentally
since then.
And yeah, it's a really hard thing to line up like that.
You know, so cat piss is still around.
Our buddy, 707 Seed Bank has cat piss in his work.
I think that Shoreline done outdoor is phenomenally
more cat piss than any other cat piss I've ever smelled,
including the San Diego.
That thing is so cat pissy.
The outdoor grove that I have here.
So yeah, and there's more than one cat piss.
Yeah.
And the cat piss people do disagree on what is cat piss.
There's some Pittsburgh cat piss,
there's NorCal cat piss,
there's the SoCal cat piss that Matt's familiar with.
And there's debates around all that shit too, you know?
Yeah.
And a lot of them are like super silver haze types
where the terpeneline kind of leans toward a pissy result.
Yeah.
Yeah, we still have the snow.
I remember the snow.
The snow came out of that same Trinity,
came out of that same Eugene glassblower small circles.
Yeah.
Our buddy CSI has had the snow since probably 98-ish
and he breeds it and all kinds of stuff.
So it's there.
I don't know the lineage on Shoreline at all.
I mean, I'm like the last person to get it.
It seems it's mysterious.
So I don't know.
Albert Walker exists.
Yep, it's around.
It exists.
So, and maybe I'll say this before we get off.
Anybody that has anything old and rare,
don't get rid of it.
Yeah, please don't.
Right now, especially with the way pricing is
and with the pressures on the scene right now,
there's a real risk for a lot of cool genetic diversity
to go by the wayside
because people might not have money
or might get into a bad spot
and might get worried about,
oh, this is, I can't even sell this for what I need.
It's not even worth.
And then they just decide to get rid of it.
And then five, 10 years from now,
there's a bunch of shit that we wish still existed.
So if you've got something that you love,
try to hold onto it
because you might be one of the few people left that has it.
You never know.
You might be one of those people
that has a contemporary line that's missing
10 years from now, 15 years from now.
If you love something, hold onto it tight.
Very much so.
Dude, you're at 370.
370, yep.
Things are climbing.
Yeah, they're slowly climbing.
I guess, yeah, let's end this option
and then maybe I could do one more
and we'll talk about the NL projects
and kind of what we're seeing.
And we are, I think we're gonna have
some Natsos LA Kush crossed to NL5 at some point.
Yeah, it looks like.
And we're gonna have, and the Maui too.
Yeah, I've been, you know,
the Maui is, he's had it for probably over a year.
It's just a matter of making its way into rotations
and being crossed to things, you know.
Yeah, there's some really exciting ones.
The corn might be in there,
which I think would be an interesting cross.
The male NL5 that we have as our keeper so far
is a spitting resemblance to the purple indica,
which I think is fascinating
since it comes from the same area.
Yeah, it is fascinating.
So that one's gonna be also in the rotation
seeing how that purple indica lines up with that male.
And I think that'll be pretty fucking cool.
It will be.
I mean, you have hope.
Yeah.
You know.
That LA Kush by Kim D,
people have been finding killer stuff in it.
Yeah, that's a great combo, it sounds like.
It seems like that one really is like
people send me pictures all the time.
Yeah.
So.
We can maybe get Pip on here one of these days, you know.
Yeah, he wants to come on.
But he's a good buddy of ours,
so we could always ask him, you know.
Right now's a tough time because the industry itself
has changed so rapidly in the past few years
that it's a hard time to get people excited
about talking about cannabis
when the actual scene is so depressing right now.
Yeah, people are trying to surrender.
And so many of our friends, you know.
And shout out to Down With Dirt.
He just recently passed.
There's gonna be a lot more of that going on, and it's sad.
But yeah, shout out to him.
If you knew him, send his family love.
And that's actually something too,
is like there's a, not what I just said about the clones,
but about seed making too,
where there's a lot of diversity at risk.
Because people need to be able
to make enough money to survive.
And as things get more centralized
and more corporate and larger scale,
and a lot of the small garage size grows,
and a lot of the passion type people
start getting pinched financially,
it becomes a lot more difficult to be like,
oh, should I dedicate this space
to something that's just for me?
Or should I just grow the whole thing
based on whatever my buddy says he can get me for right now?
And so a lot of experimentation,
a lot of experimentation is at risk,
because you've gotta be surviving pretty well
to be experimenting.
Yeah.
And what Matt was just saying
is that there's a lot of people staring at survival.
Doesn't mean it won't like shift and change,
but right now there's a lot of people
that have gotten used to living a certain way
and making money off a certain way,
and the weed game is dramatically changing.
Yeah.
It's really dramatically changing.
And so the people that are taking it over right now,
they don't really care about diversity that much.
They just care about margin
and wanting to sell you some shit.
So you could definitely lose a lot of shit
in the next five or 10 years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's leaf irrigation in the headband and the chem D,
so I'm not surprised when you see it in the progeny.
Will you answer Dickie's question
if L.A. Kush is a five fingered plant?
You know that-
That should vary, right?
It varies.
It varies.
I mean, it's not specific.
It's not a three finger,
but it could have five, seven, you know?
There is, it's,
I don't know that everything,
there's a guy that said
everything has OG Kush camera cookies in it.
I don't think that's true.
No, I mean, even my cherry berry doesn't.
AK-47 blue bonnet.
We did a bunch of stuff in this last blue round
to try to keep that from being the norm.
Made a great attempt at it anyway.
It's true that a lot of stuff does,
but there still is, if you think about it,
there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't.
Yeah.
There still is, if you think about it,
there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't.
What's up, Cody?
It's a banana tie and the silver berries.
I'm trying to think of what to put up after this one.
I think we're gonna call it in a few seconds.
I keep saying that, but it keeps going up.
So I need to add something else in and we'll call it.
I'm throwing it-
L.A. Kush has green leaves.
I mean, I have some pictures posted on my page
about it, various things.
Yeah, it's, I mean,
the one thing I'll say about diesels and L.A. and all that
is that you are not identifying that shit by picture.
Old Timers Hayes does not predate Sam.
Sam was the one who introduced Hayes
to the seed world, period.
I mean, he may not be a Hayes brother per se,
but he was the one who brought the seed line to the-
Old Timers comes from Posi, right?
Yeah.
Positronics?
Yes.
No, I don't know.
Old Timers has a different claim on theirs.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, calling it, calling it, calling it.
Professor Q, 390.
Writing it down.
And then I'm gonna throw up the P91S1s.
I'll just do a pack of that.
I don't know if they'll sell for worth a shit.
Hold on, let me write this down.
Professor Q, 390.
And this is the Cherryberry.
This is Silverberry.
And then Banana Tie.
And I think I put in Bubbleberry V2 as well.
So that's what you're getting.
Professor Q, thank you very much.
So yeah, now I'm gonna put up the P91S1s.
Start them at 200.
And if you get them, you get them.
Those of you that know, P91 is an old San Diego cut.
I didn't make very many of the S1s.
I only had the cut long enough to make S1s
and passed it out to Canerado,
one of the third gen dudes,
and Genotype A2 in Michigan.
It's some type of old super skunk,
silver pearl, maybe cross of some sort.
We have one of the original packs of the S1s right here.
So $200, I'll throw in some more shit with it.
And we got that.
Okay, now we can continue.
I lost my train of thought.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Spartan.
You don't have to apologize.
You don't have to apologize.
I just spaced out for a second.
I realized we've been talking for a couple hours.
Yeah, it's good.
I've been trying to get Matt and a buddy
to talk about the Bull Rider cut.
But yeah, it...
See, Bull Rider predated me in San Diego.
By the time I got down to San Diego,
there was no Bull Rider to be smoked
except for Afghani Bull Rider.
And I did have experience with the Afghani Bull Rider.
It was one of the most dank, loud things
that I'd ever smelled in my life.
But trying to find the original Bull Rider
was just not happening.
A while ago, a buddy, Gray Skull,
sent me some seeds of the original Bull Rider bag seed.
And I was originally gonna give it
to someone to tissue culture
and thank the fucking stars I didn't do it.
And recently sent those back to Gray Skull
so he could have them tissue cultured.
So hopefully, yeah, Bull Manna,
that was actually, it was called Bull Ghani, I think,
is what they kept calling the Afghani Bull Rider
up in Mindo when they brought it down.
Yeah, that's my coverage on Bull Riders.
Probably some kind of NL5 Hayes.
If Betsy, it really is its sister.
And to be compared to it,
I would guess like Skunk One, NL5 Hayes,
something like that.
I mean, Betsy still exists and is held by friends.
But we don't know anybody that we know.
I don't know about Afgu either.
Afgu is still around.
Yeah, Pat has it.
Oh, yeah.
I fucking love Afgu.
I wanna make a fucking sweet love to that shit.
Do you like that one?
I haven't seen that one in a long ass time at this point.
Did you like it when you did see it?
I did like it, yeah.
I think we're gonna have some
train wreck cross to it soon too.
Boy.
Oh, a Hogs Breath question.
What was Hogs Breath?
There was Tennessee Hogs Breath
and San Diego Hogs Breath, yeah?
No, that was a Adam Dunn lie.
There was no such thing as a Tennessee Hogs Breath.
Hogs Breath was a San Diego original.
One of my first mentors was the person who bred it.
And he passed away.
But yeah, it was,
God knows what it was.
He said so many different things that it could have been,
just keeping people on their toes.
But it was fucking dang.
It was very like cheesy, toe funk, fucking,
it's a little bit of sweet,
depending on how you grew it.
You could get some fruity expressions from it too,
but most of it, the way James grew it was fucking
foot funk, cheesy, nasty.
It was great.
That's good.
People are, a bunch of people are saying they still have it
or it's still kicking around Hawaii
and still this and that.
So that's nice.
I mean, you know,
one of the things that's cool is like,
if you live in an area where
there's not so much pressure to change,
a lot of old cool shit can just kind of stay around
because people can grow it
and find a home for it pretty easy.
In California, you get stuck where it's like,
oh, this, you have to do this.
You have to do this.
Oh, that doesn't work anymore.
You have to do this.
Yeah.
You know?
And now it seems like it's really bad where
prices are so low and things are so rough,
like people don't even know where to turn.
And by the time they start growing something
they think is going to be the next big thing,
it's already played out.
Yeah.
There's a lot of hype
and there's a lot of flash in the pan type stuff
where for a minute it gets a good ticket
and people are all excited about it.
And then one too many greenhouses or indoors gets it
and then nobody wants it.
Yeah.
You know?
So.
After we was just,
that, there's one thing about Aftowee I always remembered.
Like anytime Aftowee was in a hybrid,
that turf would dominate real well.
And it was, to me, the way I always smelled it
was like a blueberry cantaloupe type.
It was just so addictive.
And it's always stuck with me over the years.
And my favorite Aftowee cross was done by Bodhi
and it was the Aftowee double purple doja,
which is like an Apollo 13 type.
And it had these fucking massive yielding
fucking Aftowee turfs.
He sent me some of the last of those seeds
that I really need to get some more made.
Yeah.
Two Dog was asking,
I think Sour D preceded any of the other stuff
in the sense that when Sour D was getting passed around,
that's what it was called.
It was years before New York City Diesel
or East Coast Sour Diesel or, you know,
Shroomy Cut or, you know, Amish or, you know,
all that different types of stuff.
And that's what makes it so confusing
is everybody just got a cut of Sour D.
UK Cheese is a Fino of Skunk One, we believe.
Yep.
Okay, here, I'm gonna throw in something extra
with the P91 S1s.
I keep saying I'm gonna do it.
Now, I think this is, hold on.
I think this is only six seeds.
Let me make sure.
But this is the Banana Chunk
and it has the first name on it
because this is the old original packaging of,
I think I called it Deep Bananas at first,
which is the Chunky Monkey.
Deep Chunk Platinum Banana OGBX1.
Oh, fuck, I just found a fucking Treasure Trove of seeds.
I just found just a bunch in this one.
How about that shit?
So there will be 10 seeds in this pack.
Hot damn, love when that happens.
So that and the P91 S1 are up right now.
This is a really rare line that we put out.
There's a lot of pictures of it out there
and it was fucking phenomenal.
I've been trying to keep enough back to remake it,
but yeah, I'll put this one out there
and maybe someone else will remake it.
I didn't take any shrooms, no.
Did?
Yeah.
I didn't.
No shrooms today?
No shrooms today, no.
If I'm gonna do that kind of thing,
I'm definitely not gonna talk in public.
Yeah, for a while there,
I got to where I was taking so many shrooms
that I could keep my cool better
than I could being fucking stoned in a room on shrooms.
There is a Ruby Red Grapefruit Pheno
that people love out of Soma's NYCD.
Oh yeah.
The thing that people get upset about with Soma
is that he took supposedly some bag seed of sour,
brought it to Europe and crossed it
to some kind of Afghani fruity thing that he had over there.
And then he called it diesel.
Yeah.
And sold it as the real deal sour diesel
at a time when it was hard to get.
And that's why people get upset
it's nothing like real sour or the diesel family.
Yeah, not even close.
It has a lot of, it does, I mean, people like that.
I'm not dissing it.
I'm just saying it isn't it.
You know?
And who has real sour diesel crosses?
I do.
You know?
Yes, I does.
Arkite does.
There's different things about it.
You know, like sour diesel is another one of those
where people are coming out of the woodwork
with real deal sour.
We could probably do a whole show on what we know
and don't know that would upset a bunch of people.
The good part is that most of the diesel cuts
are pretty nice.
Most of the phenos that exist are pretty nice weed.
So if you get stuck with one that isn't the real deal,
you know?
And then someone was saying something before
about what'd you see first, Urkel or lavender.
I kind of saw them at the same time.
Right around 03, 04.
Yeah.
So that was right around that same time.
And that was about four or five years
after I had popped Mendo P.
There was definitely nothing like Mendo P
when it first came out as far as something
that just naturally turned purple that deep.
There's plenty of Afghans that turn purple with cold.
And, you know, as October came along and outdoor and stuff,
if you let them out and let the second run go late
and then got cold at night, they could turn deep purple.
But it was four or five years before that next wave came.
So, and I don't know when it started.
That's what I was saying before a long time ago
is we don't really know what year Urkel popped
or where it popped or who did it exactly.
There's various people that claim it, but.
One thing we know is that it wasn't called Purple Urkel
when it first showed up.
And I don't wanna say the name
because it's not my story to tell.
And I don't wanna give people, you know,
ammo to fucking fake it.
But yeah, it was not called Purple Urkel
when it first showed up.
Yeah, just like I was saying before,
like you don't wanna give out,
you don't wanna give out sometimes real info
because people will use it.
And like, you know, like I don't watch this shit,
but Matt watches a bunch of like murder mysteries
and, you know, people doing bad stuff to each other.
And a lot of times the cops in stories
will put out one or two things
that's a lie about the story, right?
Did you know that Matt?
They do that and they do that because,
so they can weed out all the like hot tips that they get
that use that bit.
Yeah.
Because human nature, you put out a story
and some people will start calling and start, oh, I saw.
And so they put out some fake information
just to make sure that they can weed out
because if he said what it was,
then there'd be a bunch of stories about,
oh, my uncle from White Thorn grew this
and we called it that.
So it must be, you know, by my seeds.
You know, I have kryptonite
and it throws a lot of Mendo perps phenos.
There's a lot of people that have Mendo perps
in their stuff that don't wanna say
there's Mendo perps in their stuff.
Yeah.
And it's really obvious when it's in your stuff.
Yeah, there's a lot of modern stuff
that has Mendo P in it that people never wanna admit
that it's in it.
Yeah.
So, you know, but that's pretty common.
Yeah.
Jim Ortega on a podcast,
I don't fucking know that guy is a sketch.
Yeah.
About being in public.
He did some prison time.
He came from a different era of cannabis.
I don't think he has any interest in being public.
Although I would personally love
to pick that dude's brain for a while.
Yeah.
You know, so,
but yeah, Jim Ortega is,
you know, he gave some really important strains to Neville.
Yeah, he did.
Yeah.
And he's kind of a total mystery.
And Kush 4 is gonna be one of the ones
that you will see in the NL5 crossheads.
And maybe in the Hawaiian lights too, if we're lucky.
Did I take cuts?
I used to take cuts of,
and most, a lot of breeders do this.
CSI certainly does is you take cuts
of everything you're about to bloom from seed stock.
So if you find it and you love it, you still have it.
So that's why the Mendo perps survived.
Do they have 50 year old seeds?
Will they pop?
What do you think?
Unlikely.
I will say that the couple of seeds of Mendo perps
that I had, although it wasn't called that,
I named it that, but the couple of seeds I got
were 21 years old at the time that I got them
and they popped.
20 year old seeds can pop.
50 year old seeds seems like it's going way back.
I mean, that would be like 1970.
Yeah.
Right?
That's way back.
Cheese Northern Lights.
Yes, there will be cheese Northern Lights.
Absolutely.
I think this is a great one.
Great idea from Phenodelphia.
He said, I'd like to hear anonymous people on the podcast.
Like they say what their role is
without saying exactly who they are,
given identifying details.
That would be awesome.
And we are planning to pop the purest very, very soon.
We are going to follow through
on the newest Northern Lights acquisitions.
Unfortunately, we did not get as many of those seeds
as we did of the NL5 and the Hawaiian Lights,
but we are going to try to do something
with them worthwhile,
if anything is worth doing with, if that makes sense.
There's a question.
I'm pretty sure that there's some MendoP in the cookie.
I'm not going to go into that whole thing either right now
because that's a whole story
and it would probably cause a bunch of guff,
but I guess it was good for two hours.
Yeah.
On the shit, so.
That's all good.
I do believe that there is MendoP in cookies.
The story is definitely for another time.
There's a lot, it's kind of complex, but you know.
I mean, there's really what it boils down to too
is there's 20 some years ago,
there wasn't nearly as many people breeding
as there is now because there wasn't money involved as much.
There wasn't really American seed companies doing stuff.
And so most people breeding were doing it
just kind of for the love of it
or to try to like give good weed to their friends.
Yeah.
And so as a result of that,
an inordinate amount of the stuff that people were working
on made its way into a lot of the stuff that's famous now.
Just because there was only such a big pool to pull from,
you know, it's kind of the way it happened.
Yeah.
I guess we've been doing this a while.
I'm gonna call the auction.
Give a bow.
Call the auction and we're good.
And we can do it again.
Yeah, we will do it.
And next time I promise you, Natsu will be more naked
and HD, HD, HD dick.
It's just chin up.
So, you know, I can do it full busting.
Nobody knows.
No.
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
Thank everybody for listening.
Everybody have a real good night.
And yeah, indeed.
Good seeing you brother.
Good seeing you too.
Thanks to everyone who showed up and yeah.
All the love from all of us.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
you
