What we've got here, the first thing I should show you
is this shirt.
This is made of hemp with a blend with cotton.
This is a 55% hemp, 45% cotton.
That's made of hemp?
55% hemp?
Correct.
It lasts longer.
It's 26% more water absorbent.
It's more insulative.
And it's much stronger than regular cotton would be.
In the foreground here, I've got three pieces of paper.
This is like a parchment style paper here.
This is what your Declaration of Independence and Constitution
were originally written on, a paper similar to quality
of this.
This is a filtration paper here, tea bags,
things that you need to have stay strong when it's wet.
Because hemp fiber is strong.
It doesn't lose that when it's in water.
This in the middle looks like a newsprint type of paper.
It's a pulp type of paper.
It's made of hemp, huh?
Correct.
Did they use this back in the early days,
you know, like around Constitution time or something?
Yeah.
Well, they didn't use this.
This is a pulp paper.
They used more like this, the fiber paper that's
And they wrote on it.
Manuscript paper.
Daily.
Right.
Now, over here we have some seed.
This is used as bird seed right now.
Yeah, get the birds high, right?
Yeah, it's called happy bird.
Actually, birds sing better because when they use it,
we don't know if it's, there's very little THC in there.
It seems to be because it moistens their throat
because it has a lot of oil.
In fact, it's 30% oil.
And right next to it here, we have some hair gel.
This is made from hemp oil.
And it's also got some herbs in it, some of the herbal hemp
in it.
Now, moving forward a little further,
we see some other products that are made from the seed.
When the seed is crushed, it produces
oils and a high protein powder here, which is called seed cake.
This is more nutritional than any other thing
that we know of, excepting for soya.
And in terms of digestibility, it's
more digestible than soya.
So it actually, when you look at parts of the world
like Northern Africa and Bangladesh
and these areas where there's a lot mass starvation,
a lot of that is a result of international laws
that are preventing them from growing hemp
for use as a food supply, which it
has been for thousands of years for these countries.
No, really?
Yes, exactly.
The law is the Single Convention Treaty of 1961
by the United Nations.
And you notice that the big periods of starvation
began in the mid-'60s, late-'60s,
and continue on to today.
Within 10 years of banning hemp, starvation
became part of the norm for these parts of the world.
Wow.
Now, these two pieces of oil and samples of oil,
this is a raw oil.
You see it's got a little brownish color,
similar to the seed itself.
This, on the other hand, has been distilled.
And so it's cleaner looking.
You can make anything from machine oil
to cooking oil out of these.
Wow.
These are all fibers from the plant.
This is a rather raw fiber.
This is called a toe line.
Both of these are from Russian hemp.
Russian hemp?
Right.
Now, this string here and this rope,
they're both from Hungarian hemp.
This has been made into a bag here
through a macrame process.
They've wrapped it up.
Here's a potholder made out of it.
Your balls of twine.
This tea bag back in here.
And it swings this right back down
to the plant from which all these products can be made.
Wow.
