We have these cannabis indica extract pills from, who is the manufacturer of this one?
Upjohn's, they're still around today.
They're these mini, itty bitty, teeny tiny pills.
It says that they contain one to four grains of cannabis per itty bitty, teeny tiny pill.
Now somebody would ask you, is that still any good?
No.
And of course it's not.
No, it's about 110 years old, so it's no good.
Now this one is about 125 years old, Sensopersa pills, and they're coated in this little purple stuff.
You can kind of see some of them there in the bottom, and so that's an interesting one.
And then here we have the neuralgia pills from Mumford in Philadelphia.
They're not around anymore.
But these guys are Eli Lilly.
In fact, the Bush family owns a lot of stock in Eli Lilly.
This is back from about 1920 or so.
It's cannabis extract, what is it, number 96.
They had about ten different cannabis products, including powdered hashish from Eli Lilly.
I'm curious if they still have the patent for that.
There was never a patent.
It always was grandfathered in.
They couldn't patent any of these medicines.
This one's from Park Davis, and it's also one of several Park Davis products, cannabis indica extract.
Then we come to two nifty Sharpen Dome, and they're still around too, Sharpen Dome products.
This one is cannabis from Cannabis Americana, grown here in the United States.
And this one is for migraines.
A lot of people wonder if cannabis is useful for migraines.
This is a Sharpen Dome medicine from 1890, migraine number three, with extract of cannabis listed right there on the dome.
And then finally we come to a new product that you can get at your health food store,
Manitoba Harvest, shelled hemp seeds.
These things taste like a cross between cashews and walnuts or pecans.
So they're really good, and good for you with all the omega-3s and all that good stuff.
