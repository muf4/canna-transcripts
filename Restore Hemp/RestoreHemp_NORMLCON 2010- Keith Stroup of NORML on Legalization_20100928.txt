I first smoked pot 45 years ago when I was a freshman at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C.,
and I've been a regular smoker ever since.
There is nothing wrong with the responsible use of marijuana.
It was 40 years ago next month that normal was formed.
And at the time so we've been at this now for four decades.
And our position then and our position now is there's absolutely nothing wrong with the responsible use of marijuana by adults,
and it should be of no interest or concern to the government.
They have no business knowing whether we smoke or why we smoke.
As Alan mentioned in his opening comments, we really are at a tipping point in this country.
There are more living Americans who have smoked marijuana than living Americans who have not.
And with the increasing support we have from the public now, we've made more political progress in the last five years than in the first 35.
So, folks, we are very close to winning this, closer than it looks like when you're out struggling on the street level, I understand.
But once change begins, it happens more quickly than you anticipate.
