I've been to many events
with thousands of people and I have never seen such a community in my life and
I thank you for that. I
Thank you for that. I'm gonna pass it down. So you just
You don't get the whole bag. I see you're thinking something about what's in this bag and I know what's on your mind
Washington State and Colorado have done amazing things and it's not Washington State
For instance, it is the people of Washington State it is the people of Colorado who have moved forward with
legalization of marijuana in these two states
So I applaud the people for coming out coming forward making their voices heard and being organized
In making it happen you see because that's key
You have to be organized if you want to get something done
You have to reach out to your legislators and your politicians and you have to make them do what needs to be done
And in order to do that, you have to be organized. I
Don't have much more to say but two things
Number one we all come here from many different perspectives and for many different reasons for ending the prohibition of marijuana
We all have one goal in mind and it's to remove marijuana from the
Scheduling system in its entirety not down one or two levels, but completely out of the scheduling system
We all come here for that. We all need to come together work together make that happen. And I know we can do it
We've done it in Washington. We've done it in Colorado
Now what I ask of you as I close is to help me take this steamroller because that's what it is
Completely across the country all the way to my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. Are you with me on that?
And I will be here until it's done
If it takes me to the age of 95, but I don't think that will happen
Thank you folks, thanks for being here. I appreciate you each and every one of you. Thank you
Thank you, Major. Neil Franklin from law enforcement against prohibition
