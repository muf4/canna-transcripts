I've developed a product called HemShield, which I introduced last year here.
This is the world's first hemp oil containing wood finish and deck sealer.
It may be the best one ever created.
It was introduced right here.
It's a year old today.
This is our new color line, which by the way, uses the best tints that are available on
the market.
They're not like the normal ones.
They're actually processed on this microscopic level so that the light rays, the UV rays
are reflected off and you can see through to the wood and to the color.
They use it on fancy cars and places like that.
In every way, this is a revolutionary product.
It turns out that it has more durability and a better UV resistance than anything else
out there on the market.
It beats most of the current sealers for decks by magnitudes, not 5% or 10%, but hundreds
of percent.
As Adam educated to me last year, the reason why it does this is because of the hemp oil.
The hemp oil molecule is the smallest of all the kinds of oils that are used in coatings.
It penetrates into the wood and it also makes all those other oils work better together.
We now have probably the best deck sealer ever made.
It's totally environmentally green.
No VOCs in our clear.
It has no fumes whatsoever.
The truth of it is that because we have called it a wood finish and a deck sealer doesn't
mean there aren't a bunch of other uses for it.
I'm having my first furniture manufacturer come online in the next coming weeks.
We think there's a tremendous marine application for hemp seal.
