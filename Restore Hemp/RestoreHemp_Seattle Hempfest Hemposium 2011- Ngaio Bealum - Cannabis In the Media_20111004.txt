I like, I think it was Gandhi who said,
first they ignore you, then they laugh at you,
then they fight you, then you win.
So it seems like we're past the laughter stage
and people are starting to take cannabis
a little more seriously.
That's why you see a lot of documentaries.
You see a lot of shows.
And like you said, the slant,
because they are going to fight it,
the slant has kind of changed a little bit.
It used to be a little way more open-minded
in the first couple of years,
but the last one they just had on frontline,
I thought was tilted a little more toward the DEA,
who was clearly lying,
than toward an, or even balanced,
or even more pro cannabis agenda.
So I think that's the challenge,
to create the good content for that.
And also I think, you know,
even not just national programming,
but like local programming.
I used to do a show called Cannabis Planet
and it came on in Los Angeles and Sacramento.
I tell you, I was shocked at the amount of response
that I got from people
that I wouldn't even have thought were pot cannabis users
or just people who watch television.
They're like, oh, I'll go watch that show.
So there's things like that you can do to spread the word.
So put together your own cable access show.
That's my advice.
