My friend Doss here I'd like to show everybody how he's made an industrial
hemp fiber product from medicinal cannabis. My friend Doss here has made
some paper using medical grade cannabis with high THC. This is the unusable plant
material beat in the Peter Beater on loan from Alex Whitebloom but this is
whole stalks from unusable materials from a couple of dispensaries in
Colorado Springs and then this is the fiber from those stalks without the
the herd so this is a combination of herds and this one's 50% cotton and this
is a hundred percent hemp fiber.
