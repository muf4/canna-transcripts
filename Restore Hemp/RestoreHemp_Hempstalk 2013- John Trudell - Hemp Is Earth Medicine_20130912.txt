Think about hemp. Hemp. Industrial hemp. See I think that the medical marijuana
movement will get a lot further if they will reach out and help explain the
realities of hemp, the larger issue of hemp. Hemp, medical marijuana. Hemp. Hemp
helps everybody. Hemp helps the earth. Hemp is earth medicine and I don't see
enough awareness being given to hemp as hemp. We're too busy using the medical
marijuana for our own enjoyment and to help heal the pain and these different
things but we're ignoring hemp. Hemp will help the planet. Practical reality. If
we're going to talk about medicine, all right, we're talking about medical
marijuana as medicine for the people but hemp is medicine for the earth and if we
forget the earth then we're only going halfway there.
Industrial hemp. You can build your home out of it. You can make the clothes out of it.
And hemp, the CBDs in hemp, all right, are a larger medicinal, they serve a
larger medicinal purpose for the human body than even the THC does and people
need to kind of look at this because we're talking about diabetes, we're
talking about epilepsy, we're talking about cancer. It's very effective against
breast cancer, all right. We're talking about a real deal here but nobody's
paying any attention to it. All the attention is being put to the THC aspect
and I think it's time to recognize the entire plant. For the earth. For us.
