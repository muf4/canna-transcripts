You also testified before the DEA in 1988. I did indeed. And now what what came from that and who
did you speak with when you were there? Oh I testified in front of a Judge Francis Young,
very intelligent man and the feeling of the people that I was working with normal and
that that it was he was gonna brush it off. Okay. We were gonna finish our testimony and 15 minutes
later he was gonna say forget it. He didn't do that. He agonized over this for a long time
and his decision he was only to make a recommendation to the head of DEA.
He couldn't make the decision and he recommended wholeheartedly and he had heard people all over
the United States from all different kinds of illnesses and said in effect for God's sakes
help these people. And what kind of response did he receive? The head of DEA in effect said drop dead.
Why do you think that is? Because they're stupid. Okay now I we only have a couple of minutes left
and I was wondering you commented that people of an older generation than what I am have a problem
at times being able to rethink restructure their thinking on this plant. What do you have to say
to that? Okay we were told and I came from an era that if somebody if my government told me
uh go out and stand in the middle of the traffic I'd probably do it because they would never tell
me anything that was harmful and it has taken me a long time to realize this isn't this is no
longer true. Maybe it never was but I thought it was and so therefore um it's difficult you you
you just it's like a religion you may go away from the religion that you were brought up as a child
but it's always there. Oh go with your gut feeling. If you think you're right go for it. Thank you very much.
