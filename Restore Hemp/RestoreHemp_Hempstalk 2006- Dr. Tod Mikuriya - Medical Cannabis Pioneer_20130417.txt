I myself am a medical cannabis user and once upon a time I was with the federal government.
I was in charge of the marijuana research project for the National Institute of Mental
Health until they discovered what my attitudes were on the product.
I was cast out from the federal government and I went to California where I started my
practice in psychiatry.
There I participated in different cannabis reform activities.
I was on the steering committee of Proposition 19 back in 1972, the California Marijuana
Initiative.
