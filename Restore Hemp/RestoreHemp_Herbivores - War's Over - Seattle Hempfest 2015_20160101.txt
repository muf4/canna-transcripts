War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, till then you're bound to burn.
War's over, unless you caught them in the light,
that same old night,
war lousin' them lighted.
These workers did not sink in their head.
So many give, yet so many more of them take.
Until this summer turned out to be just a half doobie.
War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, till then you're bound to burn.
War's over, unless you caught them in the light,
that same old night.
War's over, so hey people, let's all get high.

You heard the story yet.
You're going to help change and you're out to be dead.
I'm concerned now, it ain't no lie.
We all come together sooner, we all.
War's over, don't you be acting dumb.
War's over, cause there ain't no winter run.
War's over, unless you caught them in the night.
War's over, so you know let's have a party and get high.
