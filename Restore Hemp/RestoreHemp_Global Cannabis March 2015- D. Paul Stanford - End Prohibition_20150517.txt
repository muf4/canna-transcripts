Thanks folks. Hey, thanks for coming out for the March. We finally did it. We've got legal marijuana
Congratulations, and thank you for making it happen
Staying at the fight for so long. You know, I've been saying a long time that cannabis prohibition has never really been about drugs
It's about control and money and power and the continued centralization of economic and political control
I truly believe that marijuana the whole marijuana myth was created to stop the use of biofuels and fiber
They made up that whole myth. And so finally the truth is coming to light, but we're still experiencing blowback
We still have the legislature trying to shut down the medical marijuana program. They've been successful
across the river in
Washington with Senate bill 505 to
Which governor Inslee signed into law just last week
They have to stop that. I hope they can organize a referendum. They need a hundred twenty thousand signatures in the next 75 days or so
Good luck to the folks behind that
Hopefully we won't have to do a referendum here in Oregon
We have a few friends of the legislature
But we have to stay active with them as well and contact them and let them know what we don't like
It looks like the community's done a great job last week in reaching out and stopping some of the worst aspects of the
dash-6 amendments to Senate bill
844
But it's still working its way through there and we got to keep an eye on it
Anyway, we're about to go on a march. I want to thank you guys for coming out here. It's
Another year. Is this a 16th year?
16 years
It's been going on so
Thanks again. Have a great March. It's been a great show and help us restore him
