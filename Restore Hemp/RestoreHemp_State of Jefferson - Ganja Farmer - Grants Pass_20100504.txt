Summer ganja planter, call me the ganja farmer Deep down in the earth where we plant the ganja
Oh Babylon come and light it up on fire and shine
I'm just another ganja planter, call me the ganja farmer
Deep down in the earth where we put the ganja Oh Babylon come and light it up on fire and shine
I see the big stinking helicopters flying through the air
Oh what do we want to call them, call them weed eaters
Never going to sprinkle the water upon their land
And they never bring a fertilizer to a farmer, man
But don't get out of control, don't smash the officers up under your hood
I say, you've been lied to, there's no way, under the radar we play, and out of jail we'll stay
Just another ganja planter, call me the ganja farmer
Deep down in the earth where we put the ganja Oh Babylon come and light it up on fire and shine
My daddy was a ganja planter, call him the ganja farmer
Deep down in the earth where we put the ganja Oh Babylon come
Marijuana it got my heart pumping
Marijuana it got my face thumping
Marijuana it got my chest thumping
One stone of the rhythm come to tell this world something
Marijuana it got my feet stomping
Marijuana it got my face thumping
Marijuana it got my heart thumping
In the sire we say ganja, ganja, ganja, ganja
If you don't want to call it, call it sensamia
Don't want to call it, call it the indica
Don't want to call it, call it marijuana
But I say ganja, oh ganja, ganja, ganja
Ganja, oh ganja, ganja, ganja
Cause she plays every day, so lassie I say when I pray
Just another ganja planter
Say I'm the ganja planter
Just another ganja planter
I say I'm the ganja planter
