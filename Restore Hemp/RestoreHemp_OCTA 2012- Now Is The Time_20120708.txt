Now is the time, to tell the truth.
Oppressive lies and fantasies, isn't how it has to be.
Sound the alarm, investigate.
Sound the alarm, re-educate.
Now is the time, for the truth.
Corporations' documents, are rarely ever in a set.
Selection is the only way, to lift the sin of the faith.
Sound the alarm, investigate.
Sound the alarm, re-educate.
Now is the time, for the truth.
Going home, going home.
Sound the alarm, investigate.
Sound the alarm, re-educate.
Now is the time, for the truth.
Sound the alarm, investigate.
Sound the alarm, re-educate.
Now is the time, for the truth.
