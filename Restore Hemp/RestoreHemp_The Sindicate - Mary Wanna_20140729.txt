Mary wanna dance with me, girl I'll take you home
Mary wanna smoke for free, girl you'll never be alone
Go ahead lay your fingers there, girl I'll fill you with desire
Let me make this crystal clear, my homie Josh he got that fire
Mary wanna know me, melt your window, I can't breathe
Mary wanna dance with me, girl I'll take you home
Mary wanna smoke for free, girl you'll never be alone
Go ahead lay your fingers there, girl I'll fill you with desire
Let me make this crystal clear, my homie Josh he got that fire
Mary wanna know me, melt your window, I can't breathe
Know me, melt your window, I can't breathe
Know me, melt your window, I can't breathe
Know me, melt your window, I can't breathe
