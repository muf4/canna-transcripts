War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, till then you're bound to burn.
War's over, unless you're caught up in the line, that same old line.
War's over, so let's all party and get high.
War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, unless you're caught up in the line.
So what about it, ain't you heard the story yet?
You're going to help change this rat to the dead.
I'm getting way too concerned, and it ain't no lie.
We all come together soon, or we all bound to die.
War's over, don't you be acting dumb.
War's over, cause there ain't nowhere to run.
War's over, unless you're caught up in that line.
War's over, so yeah, roll one up and get high.
