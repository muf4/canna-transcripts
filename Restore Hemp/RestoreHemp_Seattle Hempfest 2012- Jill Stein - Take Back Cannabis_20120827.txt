So we can fix it. Say no to the politics of fear. Say no to that politics that tells you we don't
dare stand up for what we deserve and what we can afford. Jobs, health care, public higher education.
Instead of bailing out the crooks at the banks who got us into this mess, we need to bail out
the students who are living like indentured servants. And we can bail out, and we can bail
the homeowners who are losing our homes by the millions while the banks continue rolling in
their trillions of dollars that we paid them to stop the foreclosure crisis. They haven't
stopped it one bit. All of this is why we made change. We have the power. We are the ones we've
been waiting for. Go to my website jillstein.org, join the team, and let's start back on track. We
can change this breaking point into a tipping point and take back cannabis and medical marijuana
and hemp and the economy and the peace and the justice we deserve. It's all in our hands. Thank
you so much. Let's make it happen. Go HempSess!
