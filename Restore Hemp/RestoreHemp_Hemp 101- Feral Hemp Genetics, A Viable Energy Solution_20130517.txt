I know, Agra, that you've been working on hemp fuel projects for many years.
And could you talk about how feral hemp here in the Midwest could solve our energy problems?
Well, I don't know that feral hemp, the feral hemp genetics could solve our energy problems,
but the feral hemp is a small amount of the plant growth in the area.
If we took the feral hemp stock and grew that agriculturally.
Well, we want to grow 500 acres of hemp under a center pivot,
and we're looking at what kind of preparations do we have to undertake
in order to grow a crop of a size that can make a difference.
And assuming a hundredfold increase, you need five acres the year before that of seed crop,
dedicated for seed, not making food out of it.
And five hundredths of an acre the year before that, which is like 20 foot by 20 foot.
And the year before that, two foot by two foot, which is really one plant.
And so we're four years away from being able to grow industrial hemp
on a scale that can make a difference.
