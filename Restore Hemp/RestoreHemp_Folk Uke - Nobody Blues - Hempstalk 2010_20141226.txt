I was walking down the railroad track
Found a foot that the train had hacked
Picked it up and I started to yak
But something wouldn't let me put it back
Somehow he told me that his name was Peg
He had no tongue to speak but that's what he said
He wondered what was going on in his head
And if the rest of him was live or dead
Nobody blues
Nobody blues
I thought I had nobody
Till I met somebody who had nobody but the blues

I had a case of the nobody blues
I was tired of walking in my shoes
A lonely one in a world of twos
Till I met someone who really knew
Nobody blues
Nobody blues
I held him close up against my chest
He said that things would work out for the best
That's when I knew that it was all a test
And it was up to me to find the rest
Nobody blues
Nobody blues
I thought I had nobody
Till I met somebody who had nobody but the blues

Thank you.
