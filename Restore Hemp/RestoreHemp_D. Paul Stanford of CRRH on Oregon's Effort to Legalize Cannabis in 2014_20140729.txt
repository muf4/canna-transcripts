What have we learned from Colorado and Washington and
what have these two states done especially well or poorly from what you've seen?
Sure, I think that in Washington, the bill is fairly poor.
It doesn't allow people to grow their own.
It limits the possession to an ounce.
If you have over 28 grams in Washington, you have a misdemeanor.
If you have over 40 grams, you'll go to jail.
So this is dramatically better than that.
And in Colorado, they have a particularly onerous system of regulation
that requires video cameras on the grow site from seed to sale with video feed
to the state store, it's definitely over regulated.
We've seen prices of $700 and $800 an ounce in Washington and
several hundred dollars an ounce in Colorado.
We're not gonna wipe out the black market at those prices, folks.
I think initiative 53 will do that and
a $35 an ounce tax is certainly reasonable and I think it's a lot better.
Good.
