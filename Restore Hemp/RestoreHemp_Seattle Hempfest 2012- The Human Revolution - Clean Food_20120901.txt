So I got this crazy idea that we should replace all the GMO. Have you guys ever
driven across the country and seen all those GMO like corn, GMO soy? Some of y'all
probably don't even know that that's actually going in all of our food and
it's completely poisonous. And um, there we go. Now we got to do something about all that.
So I have this crazy idea that we're gonna like replace all those corn fields
that are all going to feed cattle all over the world and they're poisonous. We
should replace it with hemp. What do you think?
We'll have clean food. We'll have a real economy for our farmers. You know this is like
anti-farmer this stuff, this hemp prohibition.
Clean food, clean seeds, healthy babies, healthy bodies.
I'm not an experiment, not here for corporate pleasure. We've got some work to do to help.
Clean food and clean water. We're looking out for the children, for the world that we believe in.
And everybody's got a right to know if their food is a GMO.
Clean food, clean seeds, healthy babies, healthy bodies.
Sing it with me y'all.
Clean food, clean seeds, healthy babies, healthy bodies, healthy bodies.
Healthy don't be fooled. This ain't about feeding the hungry.
It's about selling pesticides, higher profits and more money.
And it's already in our food and we're already eating it.
But we have a right to know and it's in seeds.
Healthy babies, healthy bodies.
Clean food, clean seeds, healthy babies, healthy bodies.
Replace the GMO with hemp.
Clean food, clean seeds, healthy babies, healthy bodies.
Healthy bodies, healthy babies, healthy babies.
Healthy bodies, healthy babies.
Monsanto, we're going.
