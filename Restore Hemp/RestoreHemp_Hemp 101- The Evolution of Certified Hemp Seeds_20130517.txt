There is a Canadian seed growing association.
Yeah, but they're growing it for food and oil.
And they have been producing their own foundation seed.
They've been producing foundation.
And what you normally have in seed development
is you have breeder seed, you have foundation seed,
you have registered seed and certified seed,
those four classes.
So there's a four-year period in the evolution
of any certified seed.
The National Seed Protection Act provides the legal framework
for handling the genetics of seeds
in the state of the United States.
And it's consistent with international treaties.
Now, the Canadian regulations that they're operating by
go far beyond the restrictions of the Seed Variety Protection
Act.
Because under the Seed Protection Act,
a farmer can save seed enough to plant their own acreage
of a tier one.
That's a seed protection act.
Of tier one seeds.
There are many heirloom seeds that there
is no restriction on it.
I have a lot to learn about the nature of those laws.
And those are the rules I believe we're going by.
Colorado is going to be doing it its own way.
Colorado is not Canada.
And Colorado is.
And you're from Colorado.
I'm from Colorado.
And we value our autonomy and our independence greatly.
And we've gotten advice from some
of the best minds in the world.
And this is a very, very exciting time.
