Thank you so much to Scott or thrasher. He's put on a lot of work here
this is all his work today and with some help from volunteers and
also, he is the director of Portland normal which is
The organization in this state that is for consumers, and that's a voice that often gets lost especially these days
with so-called legalization in this state I
I
personally have
didn't have much of a speech plan because I spent the last three months of my life wasted on a
Swindler who was going to invest in me, but that's what we have now these days is these sharks
Circling these people who haven't been involved in cannabis at all and don't really care about the plant are now circling
to try to make money, and so I just want everybody to be
Conscious of that and aware of it and and
Aware of who you support when you do buy products and that it's people who really do care about this plant
I as he said I've been involved in Seattle. I actually moved here a year and a half ago
Because I fell in love with a grower down here, but I've been a cannabis activist in Washington state since
1995
And
You know what's happening up there is not pretty and it's you know so-called
Legalization, but you know who thinks this is legal
Do we think this is legal because the feds certainly don't the feds think you're all criminals still and they the reason that
Our regulations are so ugly is because of the feds up in Washington
It's like they treat it like plutonium or something when it's a plant that helps people. I actually had a
Friend contact me this morning
Who said that he had a friend up in Tacoma who had a five-year-old who has a serious illness and really needs
Cannabis, and he's actually calling this is an estate
Supposedly legal and you can go to the store and buy it and he can't find they can't find help for their five-year-old
And that's what's sad is that it used to be easier to help children, but with all the
Regulations that are getting piled on people and the way, they're just getting rid of medical the troop growers
Aren't there anymore, and you can't find these products that actually help people so down here. I actually had the fortunate
The fortune to spend some time down in the Applegate Valley last few days with some just incredible growers
Who put a lot of time and energy into making?
Extracts that they can give to people with with cancer and children and
They told me a story about a friend whose dad had they've been getting
Oil to for free and the doctor said I don't know what you're doing, but keep doing it
So we know that it works
And these are people that you know the state and the feds would love to run out of the business
So that they can put more and more
Regulations on this and track where every single seed and plant goes because God forbid
That it get out to people that we share it
So it's so crucial that we keep home grows
And then we keep medical gardens because these are people who are trying to get genetics out
to people the genetics that help people instead of just trying to get the highest THC and
And they're the people that can be shut out because they don't have the money that it takes to follow these regulations
They're really expensive everybody wants cheap pot
But it costs a lot of money
These when you're when you've got so many regulations on you have to you have to buy this expensive software put tags on every plant
Pay all these ridiculous taxes 280 doesn't allow businesses to
Deduct expenses at the federal level the federal the feds are taking
Half of the profits from people so it's really expensive to get in so this fight is not over while you're here
Walk around all the booths and sign up for things. It's okay to sign up for all of them
There's a lot of groups out there, but there's a lot of issues
There's going to be a lot of groups. You know people talk about oh
We all need to get together on one under one umbrella, and that's fine if you have some commonalities
But there's there's so many issues out there. I wrote I was thinking about all these there's let's see
There's smoking lounges. There's county bans. There's 280 e. There's edible limits
overregulation pesticides
Patients small growers are so many issues to focus on and
all the different organizations kind of have a different niche so be part of it sign up for all the lists and if there's one that
Really speaks to you get active get involved because this fight isn't over and and we get complacent when we think it's
Legal, but it's not there's still people serving life in prison for pot and even when there it is legal
And it seems like it's a good thing. Oh, we can all come out here and smoke pot together
but behind the scenes with the industry there's
Regulations going on that that don't help they actually hurt you know all these cups that we enjoy going to this is just one example
And actually Oregon's doing a much better the jobs in Washington. I'll tell you that much, but one of the regulations
In Oregon is that you know these the people who get a recreational license?
Can only give samples to other people with recreational license in order to try to sell it that means that when a cup comes
Along next year a recreational grower can't give a sample to the cup that it's not legal
They'd have to actually go to the store and buy it to submit it to a cup
And I brought that up to the OLCC and they they claim that that's not what they intend to do so maybe we'll see some
Changes, but it's little things like that that they're just so concerned
with tracking every bit because it might get leaked out God forbid somewhere and
They
Don't think about like the actual effect on the industry the people who have been in this so long and know what's best for the plant
And for patients, and they're worried about it might go to another state well
You know what if it's going to other states at least they're not getting into Mexico, right?
So there is it that horrible you know that hopefully we have to continue the fight to legalize it federally
That's just the number one thing right now. I think and so
Like I said go around sign up. Thank you so much for coming remember Seattle hemp fest third weekend of August largest cannabis
Protestable in the world and we'd love to see you all there. Thanks again Scott
