It is time for those of us who smoke marijuana to get up, stand up, light up, and let the
world know how we feel.
We must come out of the closet.
Now, it's true, by the way, that marijuana smoking increases your appreciation for good
food, for good music, and for good sex.
And those are not bad goals.
But it does more than that.
Those goals are quite worth pursuing.
But for millions of us, it enhances our life.
It allows us to stand back a step, to be a little detached, to view our personal life,
to view our professional life.
Therefore, tens of millions of Americans smoking marijuana can be a positive, enriching experience,
and we must develop the courage to say that publicly.
Just as gays and lesbians failed to win their rights in this country, until large numbers
of courageous individuals were willing to come out of the closet, that's what has to
happen with us.
Number one, you must vote.
If you don't vote, you're part of the problem.
Number two, when you vote, it's important to let your elected official know how important
this issue is to you.
And finally, you must take a pledge that you will never again vote for a candidate for
public office that wants to treat you like a criminal.
There were 26 million Americans who smoked marijuana just in the last year.
If we all took the pledge to never again vote for a candidate unless they were willing to
support our freedom, we'll end marijuana prohibition in a couple of election cycles.
