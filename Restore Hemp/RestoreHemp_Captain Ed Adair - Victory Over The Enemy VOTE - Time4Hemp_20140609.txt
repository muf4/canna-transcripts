My other organization is Vote, Victory Over the Enemy, which is the unregistered voter in the state of California.
What we have to do is upgrade our standard of voting. We can send people to the moon, and we're sending satellites into outer space.
I believe that our system of voting in this country is very adequate and very old. It needs to be renewed and revised and updated.
I think that the voting should be more important than Christmas. I think that we should spend a lot of money on educating the people.
Look at it this way. The government is in favor of the United States public to vote. I feel that it's our duty to show them, or to find a way to help the government find ways to help people vote.
I think with television, a telephone, computer optics, and satellite dishes, and all this technology that we've got, we should be able to sit home and vote on all these important issues.
I'm sure the government wants everybody to vote. It's our constitutional right, and they stand behind it.
I think that they should get behind us and help us to get out there and make voting a very important issue.
It is important, even if you're not in favor of, say, the California marijuana initiative or the hemp initiative, that's fine.
We would love for you to come out and speak your opinion. We want you out there voting. We want you to take an active part in this country.
If you do, then I think this will solve the problem.
