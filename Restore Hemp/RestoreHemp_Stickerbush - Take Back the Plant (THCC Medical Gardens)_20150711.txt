THC, sweet sativa,
Sid's mea, delta 9,
Smoke the ganja all the time.
Freedom fighter, the time is right,
Up the old supreme,
Sue our right to the hippie dream.
Plant our seeds, take it slowly.
The police man in the sky,
Arrest my brothers and sisters for getting high.
In the prison, they rocked away,
Of our judgment day.
We got to free the weed,
Take back the plant.
We got to take the lead.
Take back the plant.
Take back the plant.
Take a joke.
Take back the plant.
