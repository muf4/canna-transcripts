It will matter to the presidents of Latin American countries.
It will matter to prime ministers of European nations.
The entire world is going to be watching on November 7th
to see what the headlines say.
And a headline is very simple.
A headline doesn't talk about why voters voted the way that they did.
All that a headline says is what the voters did.
And we have only two options.
We have Washington legalizes marijuana
or we have marijuana legalization fails again.
So please, for yourselves, for the people of the state of Washington,
and for the world, vote yes on Initiative 502.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
