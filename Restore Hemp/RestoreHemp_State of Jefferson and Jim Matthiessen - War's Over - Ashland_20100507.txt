I was on my phone t'was nine o'clock
War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, and are we gonna burn?
War's over, unless you caught up in a lie,
that's a stable lie.
War's over, and we're gonna burn.
War's over, so let's all party and get high.
Thousands upon thousands, semline dead.
These words just did not sink in their head.
So many give, yet so many more of them take.
Until this oven turn off, it's just a path to make.
War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, until then we're gonna burn.
War's over, unless you caught up in a lie,
that's the same old drug war lie.
War's over, so let's all party and get high.

So what about it, ain't you heard the story yet?
You're going to help to change it, the rat to the dead.
I'm getting way deep concerned now, it ain't no lie.
We come together soon, or we all bound to die.
War's over, don't you be acting dumb.
War's over, cause there ain't nowhere to run.
War's over, that drug war's over, unless you caught up in a lie.
War's over, so for God's sake let's get high.
