Who are some of your greatest inspirations in our movement?
I mean, it doesn't have to be someone that's pimp-related, but who gets you going?
Well, frankly, one of the best examples of a really valuable, committed activist that I know in the entire country
is Vivian Peek, who puts his place on my list.
I don't know of anyone who works any harder.
It's all volunteer labor. He's done it for 20 years.
He's had some health problems, but nothing holds him back.
And it's the biggest marijuana protest in the world.
And it's my favorite day of the year.
It used to be two days, now it's three days.
But my favorite trip of the year I look forward to.
So Vivian would be somebody who stands out to show what one person could do.
I don't want to be unfair to people. There's lots of people who have contributed.
But I think the people that deserve the most credit right now
are the people that are pushing us beyond medical use into full legalization.
And so I really admire the efforts we're undergoing right now in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, California, and Massachusetts
to get initiatives on the ballot to legalize marijuana in all five states.
