Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the House Band of Seattle Hip Fest, The Incredible
Armadillos!
I'm out of here, so leave my house alone,
It's just so time to exercise our rights and put on a hip fest.
And we'll educate the youth who soon won't believe a lie.
It's just a matter of time, and it's time to take a stand.
This is a losing battle, no one can win,
Been going on for years,
Just keep right on going.
Like a gold boy with the comics.
You can throw a song in prison, but you cannot win the fight, because it's a losing battle.
It's about good things for good people.
This man Jim knows, take a good look at him.
Get your fence through it.
This is Vivian McPink at Seattle Hemp Fest here at Myrtle Edwards Park.
I'm with THC TV and Seattle Hemp Fest.
We just had Woody Harrelson speak.
He's enjoying some munchies now and some food.
We've got the Herbivores, our house band playing.
We've got so many people out there, I don't know how to count them.
Hey Mr. Politician.
