Two programs.
The first one, for my other program,

this is the main goal of my program.
Make a program you can write on,
because we're thinking about a volatility of intellectual property.
Every single aspect of why, what's happening,

That's what's really cool about
The voters of the state of Washington passed an initiative and the voters in the city of
Vancouver passed that initiative by an even larger margin, 54%, said yes to the legalization
of recreational use of marijuana.
We're pleased in the city of Vancouver to support the voters of our community.
We're going to have six, up to six businesses operating in the city.
I'm happy to be here to kick off this opportunity with Main Street Marijuana.
I'm pleased to see so much energy and excitement around this from our community.
So please enjoy, do it safely, do it within the law, support our local business.
I'm proud of what these guys have accomplished.
I know they want to be good neighbors.
They've outreached to the businesses and the neighbors here in Uptown Village.
I think this is a great turning of a new chapter for the city of Vancouver.
Thank you to each and everyone.
You can go take a selfie.
Number one!
It means, you know, just pretty much we're getting our freedom to smoke.
You know what I mean?
It's for everybody now.
It's not limited to everybody.
Everybody's got access to it now.
You know, the taboos are over.
How it impacts me personally, just because I've been around it for so long, so it's
nothing really new for me.
It just makes me happy to see that everybody can enjoy it now.
You don't have to worry about going to jail now.
Not having to worry about being persecuted or arrested for or harassed.
Part of history.
3.30 this morning.
Got up here from Santa in the 3.30 this morning.
Been in line ever since.
So yeah, I'm hoping it was.
We'll find out here in about 20 minutes when I get somewhere where I can enjoy it.
Oh yeah, great thing for the country.
Not just Washington, but for the whole nation.
Really.
You know, it's bigger than Washington.
This is really a huge step.
Colorado took the first one.
We took the, Washington took the second.
I'm just glad I was part of it.
The price will come down.
As soon as supply meets up with demand, prices will come down.
And it'll be marginally higher than when it was on the streets.
I'm willing to pay that to be able to do it legally and not be persecuted for it.
And if the state can generate income to fill up some gaps, a bunch of gaps,
I'll smoke a bull for schools any day.
For me it means that we can actually start funding our schools,
putting more money into our police departments,
and hopefully find the cure for cancer.
