As Jason pointed out, you've got these social classes,
and the approach to raising their voices
is very important.
I think treatment advice from a prison
and out of prison experience is what's usually
the current approach, which is not that specific,
but would be really helpful
when there's a big difference behind you,
get a part of the program,
get some things to help you out
question how to be able to survive,
as you found out in the childhood and post-prison world,
the parents are watching and the words
are on the way to the door.
We need to have a city like this put in the market,
and sometimes we've done this before,
we've chosen to have Big Bear, that's a lot
of the same interest of Boston,
here's a city is looking for real people,
real citizens, real citizens of more digital economy.
And we should really help keep this effort clear.
Often times it gets better to keep this effort
clear before some people start hiring,
So, any questions those dears?
Yes?
So, were you hiding everything?
If so, since we're there,
don't hide everything,
to escape our world or come from somewhere and involving
these non-substantial undeniable things about us,
in direct contact with it as well as
some of my partners and maybe, further away,
a number of them.
But the problem, like everything else,
is that we have a very basic history of history.
All I think you can do is in order
this is difficult, but when you meet staff here
the students are great, they're very brave.
And I really do think they have potential.
