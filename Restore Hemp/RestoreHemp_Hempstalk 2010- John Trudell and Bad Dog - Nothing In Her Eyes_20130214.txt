Spoken anger, silent hurt, some kind of wheel inside her head, going around and around inside
her heart.
Heated passions, chilling effects.
When they first met, she couldn't forget.
Times only purpose was for them together.
They talked together and were gentle.
They laid together and were flame.
She told him her prayers, trusting him with her dreams.
She needed a friend, she needed a man.
Inside her head, going around and around and around and around.
His newness stretches thin.
Turns out he didn't understand.
Part of the man let her down.
Part of the man couldn't give.
Part of the man he never was.
Part of the man, part of her life.
Been all through this before.
Now here she is, acting tough again.
Turning herself off fast.
Hurts dropping in place.
Giving away nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing in her eyes.
Spoken anger, silent hurt, some kind of wheel inside her head, going around and around and
around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and
around inside her heart.
Heated passions, chilling effects.
Now here she is, acting tough again.
Turning herself off fast.
Curtains dropping in place.
Giving away nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing in her eyes.
