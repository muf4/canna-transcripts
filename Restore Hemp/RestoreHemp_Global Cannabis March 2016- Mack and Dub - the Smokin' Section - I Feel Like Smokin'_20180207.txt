We came a long way with this movement.
Big ups to all the dispensaries out there today.
Big ups to all the growers.
Big ups to all the freedom fighters,
the front liners that really got in the trenches
and made this thing happen, y'all.
Big up to all the trimmers for making the buds look great.
Trimmers, where you at?
Big up to all the bud tenders, man.
All the bud tenders, we need them.
Hey, I just wanna say something.
What's up, dog?
Okay, so when we first started this off, man,
it was just one place in the whole United States
where you could just go legally and smoke,
and it was the world famous Cannabis Cafe.
Y'all give it up for Mellon and Senior Martinez.
Because right now, all the work
that the Hemp and Cannabis Foundation done,
all the ZRH done, all the Oregon Normal,
Portland, Oregon, Oregon Hemp Works done,
that allowed us to have a whole bunch of these places.
We got weed legal here,
but we gotta continue to fight for the legalization
so we can end this mass incarceration
and this prohibition and this war on our people.
Yes.
Can I get an amen?
Amen.
Yeah.
We want y'all to sing the words of this song
because I know everybody done woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.
Yeah, he is.
Everybody might've went through a little something, son,
but this is one of them songs where you feel like smoking.
And it is off that new Potlandia album,
so if you like it, hop online and download it, all right?
Sing it with us, y'all.

Trash chickens had the stickies and he said,

Ask me, had I ever been pineapple wasted?
Not yet, but I'm ready to try it.
That cookie looks like I'ma like it.
Smells like something extra exotic.
What else you got there in your pocket?
Joints rolled up that look like perfection.
We both turned and looked at the exit.
Guess that's what I kinda expected.
