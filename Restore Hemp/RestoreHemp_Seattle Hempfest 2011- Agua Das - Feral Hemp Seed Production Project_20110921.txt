Yes, well what we are out to do is we want to grow 500 acres under a center pivot on
Navajo or Apache land.
In order to be ready for the success, we need to have 5 acres growing hemp seed for seed
to plant 500 acres, assuming a hundred fold increase each year.
And the year before that we need to have five hundredths of an acre, which would be
20 foot by 20 foot.
And the year before that we need to have one hundredth of that acre, which is two foot
by two foot, which is one plant.
So that means we're four years away from being able to grow hemp on a scale that could
have a real impact.
