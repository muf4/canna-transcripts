This song is called Medication Recreation.
It's a song about how you can get rid of your pain and maybe cure your disease.
So sit back with a sack of the finest trees.
Roll one up and give your body what you know it needs.
Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
Educate to medicate and recreation.
No medicine can do no thing quite like this.
So please give me my cannabis.
Y'all know I hit that green carpet with all the pop stars at the High Times Cannabis Cup.
And do you know where you are? Smoking with my friend LK in that VIP.
And it's time for oil dabs. I guess I'll take two or three.
Yes and then we'll smoke that J and pass along those medibles.
Have you seen this place? Man, these things are so incredible.
Just think about it. Weed is far as the eye can see.
So come on and legalize and give the people what they need.
Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
Educate to medicate and recreation.
No medicine can do no thing quite like this.
So please give me my cannabis.
Cannabis, ganja, marijuana.
Educate to medicate and recreation.
No medicine can do no thing quite like this.
So please give me my cannabis.
