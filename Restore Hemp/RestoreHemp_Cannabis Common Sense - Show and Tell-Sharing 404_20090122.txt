Right here from England we have a bottle of Chloridine.
Chloridine was a typical, actually this is from Australia,
a typical compound that was used, I'm just going to read what it says it's
used for. It affects great relief in all cases of
diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, fevers, neuralgia, bronchitis,
asthma, croup, cramps, influenza, and as a sedative medicine for the use
in a great many complaints. Sounds very familiar doesn't it? Yes it
does. Now this is a bottle of
medicine. It's actually full of a hundred little capsules
from the manufacturing chemists and they are the successors to Bell and
Company and this is Cannabin Bell. It's an
extract of cannabis, strychnine, and zinc phosphate.
Cannabin Bell, a nerve tonic and stimulant for the treatment of mental
and physical exhaustion, depression, insomnia, neuralgia, etc.
One tablet after each meal and at bedtime. Gradually increase your dose to
two, four times a day as directed by your physician. So we got
these nifty little green tablets in there in the bottle and it's
there's a hundred of them in there and they're about a hundred years old.
Now this is from England. This is an apothecary
canister. It probably would hold about a half ounce or so and it's got a nifty
little mark on the bottom on le and it shows
some wear and with age on the inside a little bit.
And so there you have it. Then this one is from the Columbus
Pharmacist Company and it's Nervine Improved Elixir. Nervine Improved Elixir.
So I'm going to pull it away and read from the bottle.
It contains cannabis indica right up at the top
and it's useful in the treatment of congestive, convulsive, and reflexive
neuroses, insomnia, neurasthenia,
affections due to derangement of the nervous system, epilepsy, nervous
insanity, dysmania, hysteria, and uterine congestion. A dose
is one teaspoon four times a day. There it is. For hysteria. Yep, hysteria
and uterine congestion.
