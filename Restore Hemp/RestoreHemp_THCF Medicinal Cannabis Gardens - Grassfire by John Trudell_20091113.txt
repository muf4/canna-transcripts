In between the blues, there are good days and bad days, with everything and nothing
to lose.
While the setting sun never sits, and the night has no limits.
The void between freedom and free, dealing with the unnatural reality.
A need to see, a need to be.
Grassfire, my DNA needs THC.
Grassfire, in a world that yearns, that's the way this fire burns.
Like a grassfire.
In the unnatural society, and trying to maintain, while the sane appear to be clearly insane,
with no way to explain.
Outlasting the great lie, a sparking spark does my mind.
Grassfire, pulling the sky, breathing in Sativa's design.
Grassfire, in a world that yearns, that's the way this fire burns.
It's a grassfire.
The void between freedom and free, dealing with the unnatural reality.
A need to see, a need to be.
Grassfire, my DNA needs THC.
Dreaming of long times past, all that those times brought.
Looking to the heart of tomorrow.
Grassfire, in a world that yearns, that's the way this fire burns.
