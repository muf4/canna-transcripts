You know, I am the only candidate running for Clackamas County Commissioner that voted
in favor of Measure 91.
And I think it's important that all of us who voted for Measure 91 get involved in our
communities at every level.
City, county, state, doesn't matter.
We all really need to be involved and talking to Oregon Health Authority, especially because
they're the ones who are running our medical marijuana program straight into the ground.
Right now, I am running for Clackamas County Commission because when we legalized marijuana,
57% of Clackamas County voters voted in favor of it, but not one of our Clackamas County
Commissioners did.
And they decided to go with their vote when it came time to make regulations.
They didn't consider the fact that they were on the losing side of that vote, and instead
of opting out of legalization, they decided to zone it out.
And they made it nearly impossible to start a cannabis business in Clackamas County.
And that made me mad enough to want to run for office and let them know that they were
wrong.
So, I hope you'll all support me in my run, and I'd like to see you all out there at the
Oregon Health Authority meetings.
Have a great day.
Let's get to marching!
