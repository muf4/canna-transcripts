If the voters vote yes for your initiative, can we see a peaceful transaction in the federal
government and stay out of the business of Oregon?
Or do you anticipate more court proceedings?
Or how is that going to proceed?
I anticipate more court proceedings.
We designed our proposal to deal with what I've always considered an inevitable challenge
by the federal government.
We've done that by raising a number of findings by the people.
We all live under the belief here in the United States that the people are the sovereign and
the ruler.
So based on that belief, we've had findings by the people written into our proposal.
Much as Oregon's death with dignity law was enjoined in federal court and went to the
Supreme Court after two years on a fast track, the Supreme Court ruled that doctors could
recommend our prescribed phenobarbital for terminally ill patients.
We think our bill will go into federal court and inevitably change the Controlled Substances
Act.
An even bigger hurdle is the single convention treaty which mandates that cannabis be a Schedule
1 substance.
In Oregon, our Board of Pharmacy has already rescheduled marijuana to Schedule 2 as has
the Board of Pharmacy in Iowa.
So two states have already broken with that restriction in contradiction to the single
convention treaty.
Our initiative also imposes a system of controls that we lifted from the single convention
treaty.
So time will tell.
I have no confidence in the composition of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Roberts.
But it's the best shot we have, I believe.
Thanks.
