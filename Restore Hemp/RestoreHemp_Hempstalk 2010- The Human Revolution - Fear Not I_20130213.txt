I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid
I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid
For as long as I walk upon this land
I know That Yah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this Earth
For as long as I walk upon this land
I know That Yah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this Earth
Well, money will come and go, I will have no fear of poverty, no
And I will spread the abundance when Jah give it to Isaiah
Money will not make Guy free, and I shall stand real tall
When evil tries to take Guy down, nothing can prevent us from doing Jah works
All the angels are here to answer the call
For as long as I walk upon this land, I know that Jah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this earth, yeah
For as long as I walk upon this land, I know that Jah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this earth, yeah
So fear not good people of this earth, redemption is upon us now
The evil is leaving, they're taking their gold
And this thousand years of peace will be left alone
So forward with Jah works to the next level of consciousness
Everything I need is right here for I, living positive and no fear in I
For as long as I walk upon this land, I know that Jah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this earth, yeah
For as long as I walk upon this land, I know that Jah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this earth, yeah
Take a break
As I go walking down the streets of the Babylon system
I look around everywhere, do I see fear in the eyes of all the good people?
But there is no reason to fear me, I am Jah's soldier, live only for love
Here to protect you, to unite as one
So leave all our negative vibrations behind, stop hurting ourself
Be humble and kind
For as long as I walk upon this land, I know that Jah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this earth, yeah
Sing it with us if you believe it
For as long as I walk upon this land, I know that Jah will protect me
As long as I walk upon this earth, yeah
Jah is protecting
