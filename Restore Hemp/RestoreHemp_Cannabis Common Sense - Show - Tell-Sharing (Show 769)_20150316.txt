This is a circa 1920 bottle from Eli Lilly, cannabis.
And then right next to it, we have 1890 bottle.
This is actually still full.
And this is Lipuys Balsam for Coughs.
It's a cough medicine.
This box is in like five different languages,
and it comes with this insert that's in nine more.
So this was a very useful medicine.
Here's another one from 1910, Standard Medicines
out of Illinois, the Lloyd brothers.
They sold many of these medicines.
This is also a partially full bottle.
And this is an unopened box.
It still has the full bottle still inside.
Right next to it, this bottle was dug up.
This is a embossed bottle that says, as you can see,
Dr. D.H. James' Cannabis Indica.
So this was another medicine.
This is a combination medicine.
It's cannabis with, what else has it got?
Lecithin and lime and iron.
It has a little bit of strychnine in it, too.
I don't know why they put that in there,
but it's for nervous prostration, nervous exhaustion,
nervous disability, nervous excitement, hysteria,
and all depressed conditions of the nervous system.
You can read that right on there.
So it was a widely used medicine.
But most importantly, we're still burning
our hemp flame of freedom.
This is hemp seed oil burning a wick of hemp fiber.
And this is why marijuana was made illegal, folks,
right here.
It's all about money and power and energy.
They created the whole marijuana myth
to protect the petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
military, industrial, transnational,
crony, corporate, elite, ruling class and their wealth.
Sons of bitches.
Yeah, those guys, too.
There you go.
And so here it is.
The hemp flame of freedom continues to burn brightly
here on Cannabis Common Sense.
