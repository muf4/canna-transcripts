Well welcome to gasification 101. In 1990 Don and I became the first people
pressing hemp seed oil in the United States since 1937. From all of what Jack
was saying I thought lots of people were already doing it. Turned out we were
pioneers. The hemp is grown primarily for the nutritious seed as is the flax
seed. And I in the past considered flax a competitor to hemp but the both of them
have an incredibly similar history. The energy in the hemp herds is about 8,000
BTUs per pound on a moisture and ash free basis. The gasification equipment
does pyrolysis followed by gasification. Pyrolysis is where the plant material is
heated to turn it into charcoal and about half of the energy is in the solid
charcoal at the end of pyrolysis and the other half is in the gases and the tars
that burn off in the making of the charcoal. So my gasification technology
takes those tars which would gum up an engine and turns them into a tar free
gas which can be readily cleaned up and run an engine. We can take wood we can
take the charcoal as a solid before it's gasified you put it in the soil and it
makes biochar and wood will rot and if we don't do anything with wood or hemp
herds or plant materials the soil organisms will burn them into CO2 and
water vapor just as if we had used them and burned them ourselves. But if we can
do work with our gasifier that prevents the use of petroleum fossil fuels we can
have a major benefit on the climate because the energy that's spewed out by
a hundred gallons of gasoline is one full ton of CO2 greenhouse gas is spewed
out for each hundred gallons of gasoline. If you want to know what your you know
your carbon footprint is look at it in terms of how many gallons you burn
that's a big part of it.
