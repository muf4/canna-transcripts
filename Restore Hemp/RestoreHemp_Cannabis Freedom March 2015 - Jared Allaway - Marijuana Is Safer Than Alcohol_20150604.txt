I'm an occupational safety and health professional.
I've worked in various industries including aerospace manufacturing,
nuclear pellet manufacturing, nuclear weapon demilitarization, etc.
As a safety professional over the years, I looked at various material safety data sheets.
I found there is no threshold limit value for marijuana.
There is no permissible exposure limit for marijuana.
There is no amount of marijuana that you can consume that will cause death.
Ever since I read the book Marijuana is Safer, so why are we driving people to drink?
By Steve Fox, Paul Armentano, Mason Gertwith, Forward, by retired Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper,
I've been trying to spread the message that marijuana is safer than alcohol.
I see a lot of people in the audience wearing safer shirts.
You can see that some people make their own safer shirts using stencils.
That's part of what I do.
Legalizing marijuana is more important than me.
And as you can see, when you take the selfishness out of it, it can grow.
Some of the best pot I've ever seen was not grown for selfish reasons.
It was grown for people who need it.
Ever since 5052 passed, we have a limited amount of time
where we can still grow our own and share with grandma.
So please call your lawmakers and tell them to undo 5052.
Look at our 76, no.
We have a table here. We should have the initiative ready to go soon.
You don't have to collect as many signatures on a referendum as you do on a petition.
So that's nice.
They do have to be printed on 11 by 17 double-sided paper.
20 signature sheets. We may have some 3 signature sheets or 4 signature sheets with mail-in capabilities.
But yeah, we need to undo 5052.
Call your lawmakers. Participate in the referendum.
We want homegrown. Thank you.
