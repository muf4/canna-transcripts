There was a time when we boycotted going to South Africa at all or sending anything to South Africa
due to the state of apartheid.
But this concept still prevails in this earth.
You have to show your ID.
If you're not from this country, you can't come in.
If you're not from this country, you gotta leave.
You're getting checked at the border.
You're getting arrested just when you're getting checked for doing nothing.
Your papers aren't straight.
And you're already a citizen of the earth.
So that's still apartheid.
So this song is called Kill Apartheid.
Peace, love and reality
Justice for the people of the world
Yes, I look throughout life
And I know it is not right
For a man to kill a man
Because he's black or cause he's white
So I'll fight with all my might
To help us see with better sight
Cause we can all shine the light
Of rainbow colors shining bright
We got to kill, kill, kill, kill apartheid
We got to burn apartheid in a hot tower of fire
We got to kill, crumb and paradise
We got to oppress a man and kill apartheid
Yes, I look throughout life
And I know it is not right
For a man to run away
Before he ever stands to fight
So I'll sing with all my might
So they can hear me through the night
It's time for us all to unite
Of rainbow colors shining bright
We got to kill, kill, kill, kill apartheid
We got to burn apartheid in a hot tower of fire
We got to kill, crumb and paradise
We got to oppress a man and kill apartheid
And I know we gonna do it, y'all
And I know we gonna give it, y'all
And I know we gonna do it together
And I know we gonna live it, y'all
And I know we gotta give it, y'all
And I know we gonna live on forever
And this a piece of reality
Reaching out to higher society
I want you to start checking for humanity
And start sharing for your property
Alleviate the pressure on the poverty
And build a better family community
So we can all be free
Yes I live and I breathe
And I hope and I do
And I know we'll survive
And we'll all carry food
Have no fair children there
For the best of times are near
I can see it so clearly, you can too
We got to kill, kill, kill, kill apartheid
We got to burn apartheid in a hot tower of fire
We got to kill, crumb and paradise
We got to oppress and murder
Kill apartheid, yes I have
Peace, love and reality
Just death for the people of the world
I'm crying out, I'm singing out
I'm chanting out, I'm yawning out
I'm writing out, Babylon you must come out
Fire right in your mouth
We got to kill, kill, kill, kill apartheid
We got to burn apartheid in a hot tower of fire
We got to kill, crumb and paradise
We got to oppress and murder
Kill apartheid, yes I have
And I know we gonna do it, Jah
And I know we gonna give it, Jah
And I know we gonna do it together
And I know we gonna live it, Jah
And I know we got to give it, Jah
And I know we gonna live on forever
