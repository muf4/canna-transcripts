Oh, the evening sun goes down
You're gonna find me hanging around
Nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
Many people just like me
Dreaming of old used to be's
But I'm not the one
Nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
I said I'd like a blowjob
I said I'd like a blowjob
Mine is just another seed
From the world of broken dreams
Nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
I said I'd like a blowjob
I said I'd like a blowjob
Mine is just another seed
From the world of broken dreams
Nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
Nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
Nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
