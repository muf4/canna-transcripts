Feeling crazier than hell
Got this time on my hands
And got you on my mind
And got nowhere else to go
The fires burn hot and cold
There's some place in between
The melt and the freeze
This need for reaching for you
You were all I could be
Now I'm here wearing alone
We were one, now I'm a ghost
Falling from my place in the sun
This dizzy is out of control
The world keeps spinning
I heard a vibrating echoing
Sounded a lot like you
Amongst the truths I saw
You were the one that I found
Now I'm needing the remembering close
Of memories of you holding my hand
Remembrances of laughter singing
Songing the nights with belonging
Sweetnessing the shelter of each other
Reality, the reality of safe feeling
guitar solo
With all these times of missing you
I'm never not going to love you
These days without you to hold my hand
Feeling crazier than hell
This crazy goes on
And this confusion amazes
Crazy together or crazy apart
But crazy is crazy
It's not always in our heads
Sometimes it's in our hearts
Feeling crazier than hell
Got this time on my hands
And got you on my mind
And got nowhere else to go
guitar solo
