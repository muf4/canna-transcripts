This next one is for a lost friend of ours.
LK, thank you very much, brother.
I love you, man.
Love you for everything you did for us.
And this next one is for you, brother.
["Cannabis, Cannabis, Cannabis"]
Cannabis, ganja, needy one man
Educate to medicate and recreation
No medicine can do nothing quite like this
So please give me my cannabis
["Cannabis, Cannabis, Cannabis"]
You know I smoke the kind of weed that you see in your dreams
Straight outta high times, man, you should see this green
CBDs, LNNs, and that DHC
And you best not forget about that THC-V
Yes, HVs are the things that your body may need
To help get rid of your pain or maybe cure your disease
So sit back with a sack of the finest trees
Growin' up and give your body what you know it needs

["Shake Down the Street"]
Nothing's shakin' on Shake Down the Street
Used to be the heart of town
See, this city ain't got no heart
You just gotta look around
Nothing's shakin' on Shake Down the Street

You know I hit that green carpet with all the pot stars
At the Hot Tubs Cannabis Club and do you know where you are?
Smokin' with my friend LK and that VIP
And it's time for oil dabs, I guess I'll take two or three
Yes, and then we'll smoke that J and pass along those medibles
Have you seen this place, man? These things are so incredible, just think about it
Weed is fuzzy, I can see, so come on and legalize it, give the people what they need
