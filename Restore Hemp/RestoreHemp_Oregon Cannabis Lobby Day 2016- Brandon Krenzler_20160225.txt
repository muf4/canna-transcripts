Hello, my name is Brandon Krenzler and I'm here representing Parents for POT.
I'm the executive director of the national organization that supports the
family unit. Today I stand here feeling pretty apathetic just like most of you.
We voted for a law that protected our medical program that's been in
existence for over a decade. It's worked very well, it's helped a number of people.
When I grew up I was told that we lived in a democracy. It feels like we live in
a capitalist patriarchy because the only way to get anything done is to fund it
with our own money. I'm not a rich person. None of us are rich people. The only
people getting any traction with our legislators are our biggest lobby groups
here in Oregon that are funded by our own industry that are actively
advocating for the dissolving of our medical program. We need to come together
and get right. We need to be able to ensure that what we voted for is going
to be what goes on. We need our medical program to stay here for the benefit of
our parents, of our children, of everybody in our community. Without the program
anybody under the age of 21 loses their safe access. That's wrong. They have no
say. They can't leave school and come here and tell these people how it
benefits their lives. We can't afford to leave our jobs every single day that
they have these meetings to remind them of who we are and the voice that we have.
We have to take time out of our day to come here and do things on the steps
like this. This shouldn't have to be we voted. We voted yes. We need to penalize
the places in our state that aren't allowing our program, that aren't
allowing our legalization, that aren't allowing anything but continuous
persecution. Take that 3% away from them. They don't deserve it. There's people in
those counties that voted yes too. What is going on? This is corruption. We need
an end to the corruption. This is a voting year. Make them earn our votes.
Thank you.
