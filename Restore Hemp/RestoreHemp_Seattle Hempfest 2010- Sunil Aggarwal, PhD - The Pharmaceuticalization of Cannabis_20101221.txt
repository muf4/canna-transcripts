All we talk about race and you know that African Americans and Hispanics get arrested more than
Caucasians and all classes of drug related arrests they get sent to jail more they get prosecuted more and it's totally totally
Unfair and does not represent race characterizations in America, but what's even more subtle underlying this is privilege
Some people are allowed to use cannabis and some people are not that's all plain and simple it is
Privilege game and I'm telling you all right now
That is the people don't figure this stuff out get cannabis back in their hands
There is something coming down the pathway and that's called pharmaceutical is a tion
There is a company in England that is making a cannabis spray
Okay, they are taking cannabis plants throwing them up and dissolving them in liquid carbon dioxide
Okay, you take dry ice you put a cork on it and after a while you get a little mixture and you can dissolve
Cannabis in that mixture. It's been done since the 1800s
Okay
But these guys have figured out a way to nicely cleanly do it with chopped up cannabis that they got from the Dutch
from the Dutch seed banks, okay
and then
Then what happened eventually these guys were able to make a mixture of one strain with a high THC
Content and one strain with a high CBD content these strains are you can find these in US and a bunch of states
Then they went to the International Naming Board and said this is not ash oil. This is not marijuana
this is
nebiximals
This is a total extraction and liquid carbon dioxide
Straight up from straight conga that they've mixed up together in one-to-one ratio and they're calling it nebiximals
They are allowed to import this into the country
It's straight up from cannabis and they're using it in clinical trials, which is great
It's medicine for patients in hospitals, but you know what they're telling the government they're saying look when you approve our spray
Leave cannabis in schedule one, but take our cannabis extraction out of schedule one so we can make
$2 so we do not have to
wait for
You know compete with other growers, so I mean, I'm just telling you this is coming down the pike. It's really crazy
It's a crazy world of privilege. That's pharmaceutical privilege over the people's right to cultivate their own medicine
If it's not if you guys don't know about this
if you if you want to if you want to know part of what's called the politics, please pay attention to this because
Before you know it, you know pharmaceutical company will have that in your bar tells you can get a prescribed
Coming down this is this is happening under the Obama administration and Obama himself
He is appointed the major person who was responsible for raiding all the cannabis dispensaries in California
Has to be the head head of the Drug Enforcement Agency
You guys want to keep seeing those kind of like repressive politics which keeps lots of people down keeps the keeps the privileged politics going
Don't do anything about it
Keep your little zone
but if you want to see the change if you want people to have access to this thing and you
I'm sure you all do because like everybody wants people to share
The benefits of Mother Earth. I mean, this is what this is. It's 37 million year old plant
So anyway, I wanted to share that with you
I want you guys to be very excited that you're in a place like Seattle which allows a hundred thousand people to come together
Like this, I mean, this is pretty amazing
But you know, it cannot be just once a day once a year it has to be all the time
Okay, just go to one place and feel like you can be comfortable on campus
Should be a cannabis free zone a zone that cannabis can freely be talked about
Consumed if appropriate and just you know part of our landscape like it's been forever
So that's what I hope that's what I hope to see and I will be back with you all next year
