Well, and whatever is going on in this dimensional reality,
we'll never out-fight them.
It's about out-thinking them.
It's about out-thinking them.
Just think about that.
Right? About out-thinking them.
Alternative energy. Power. Power.
Power. Alternative energy.
Conscious, live thought.
Process of thinking. Energy.
We are the alternative energy that can make the change to happen.
But we really have to understand what this means.
We really have to get it and understand it,
then we become that power.
The power of the people, guys.
It doesn't have shit to do with the vote or any other thing.
It's got to do with thinking with a clear, coherent, intelligent mind.
Use the intelligence. Clearly and coherently.
How much power do we have?
Can you make yourself feel miserable with your fears and your doubts and your insecurities?
If you can do that, you have power.
Simply put.
Alright?
So it's just a matter, but that's power used incoherently and chaotically.
So just think. It's mental shifts here.
And use that power clearly and coherently.
And real change.
This is the power of the people.
Like this Cannabis Tax Act.
You vote, but the voting is like using it as a tool.
You know? You just use it as a tool.
But your power isn't there.
Your power is in here.
