John Lucy, Law420.com. I represent Anonymous as well as Occupy as well as the global cannabis
movement. So, what I'm here today to do is something really simple. I'm here to help
you protect your rights. So, I'm going to read a little bit of information that's on
every single one of my business cards back and front that you need to know when you deal
with the cops or you deal with anyone who's trying to get you in front of the cops. And
it's really simple and I want you to listen and repeat it back to me. So we're going to
do a little call and response. Everybody know how to do that? Everybody got that? Okay.
Remember to be polite. Okay? That's the critical part of this. Don't be a jerk to the cops.
Just be polite. They hate it more than anything when you know your rights. So, I do not consent
to any searches. I do not wish to answer any questions. I invoke my right to silence. And
I wish to consult with my attorney. We're going to do it again. You know why? Because
if you remember this, you'll probably never pay me a dime. I do not consent to any searches.
I do not wish to answer any questions. I invoke my right to silence. And I wish to consult
with my attorney. If you can't remember that, I've got wristbands. They just say I want
my lawyer. Cards are over there if anybody needs them. You guys have a wonderful day.
Unfortunately, I've got a client in custody. I've got to go over to the jail and take care
of it. I love you guys. Stay safe. That's how John Lucy does, guys. He's always working.
He's always working for freedom and supporting the many, many great and wonderful activists,
patients and people that we have in this cannabis community.
