And I said, what then?
Just give me a microphone and I will talk to them.
I say the people here in Ashland know they are my friends
And they will be until the end.
Oh, and I said, what then?
The writing on the wall, what is the message you send?
I know there's hope, I'll be in my bread tread.
And Babylon will never see the rising of Jah's son.
I said I'm gone
Said I'm gone
Said I'm gone
I said I'm gone, gone, gone
Said I'm gone
All right.
