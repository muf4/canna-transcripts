I'm a science nut and I look at the endocannabinoid system, the marijuana-like compounds that we make,
and I look at how they participated in evolution to the point that we have humanity,
and we have us standing here and sitting here talking about it.
And what that direction means and shows is that we have to increase our cannabinoid activity.
That's the way nature has occurred up to now, and now we have the ability to self-reflect,
see how we got here, and know where we can go.
And that's why it's totally unstoppable, it's just a matter of time,
because what we're doing is the natural evolution of life on this planet
and the critical role that this planet has in being able to tweak our endocannabinoid system
and to create a world of people who are more high rather than having it run by people who are less high.
