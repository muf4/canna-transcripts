You know, it's a couple years after 502 and many of us have disagreements with each other
about that, but there's too few of us to be divided.
More love, less attitude, okay Seattle?
Can you give us some of that please?
So we can move forward together and finish the work so that nobody gets fired from their
job just because they're a consumer.
Nobody is denied housing just because they're a consumer.
We have to end cannabigotry and the way to do that is to come out of the closet, is to
talk to people, is to let them know, listen, I'm not a recreational marijuana smoker, I'm
a responsible adult consumer.
Just like people consume alcohol responsibly, I consume cannabis responsibly and you have
to have that conversation.
And that's pretty much it.
I really, it was a great day today.
Everybody be safe on your way home.
Thanks.
