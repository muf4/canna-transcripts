Hi, I'm Willie Nelson and I urge you to support the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act to
regulate marijuana and restore industrial hemp. This initiative will end
adult marijuana prohibition and let our criminal justice officers focus limited
resources on real criminals and not on marijuana users like me. OCTU will also
allow farmers to grow hemp for fuel, fiber, and food to create jobs and help
our economy. Please support OCTU. Thank you.
