Thank you guys very much. Once again we're The Syndicate. We appreciate you guys very much.
We're from Vancouver and I have to say, even with the hiccups, being able to smoke weed is awesome.
All the time. It's pretty friggin' great.
I watch her move so slow
I watch her body roll
I watch her dip so low
I'm bound to lose control
So slow, so slow
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Slow, so slow
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I move myself so close
I can't chase her pulse
I watch her move in every direction
I'm bound to lose control
So slow, so slow
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
