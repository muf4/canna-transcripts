This is, as you can see, Indian cannabis, a fluid extract of Indian cannabis from Wyeth and Brothers.
Right next to it is a cannabis compound called Kill-A-Cough. It's a really neat bottle.
If you like bottles, and I do, this one is a chloroform cannabis mixture.
It's called Kill-A-Cough as a cough medicine.
Next to it, we have this. It also came in this. It's also Kirkcall's cough medicine.
It has a little package here with instructions in Swedish, Bohemian, Spanish, Italian, French, and several other languages.
This is also cannabis and chloroform.
Basically, that would just knock you out, right, doctor? You take cannabis and chloroform, boom, you're knocked out.
You won't be coughing.
Then we have this one from Eli Lilly, a one-pint bottle of fluid extract number 96 cannabis.
Eli Lilly had about eight different cannabis preparations, several of them pure, some of them were fluid extract.
I mean, powdered extract of hemp, which was basically hashish.
Then we have this little package of hemp oil.
We've taken it and lit this lamp to demonstrate the energy potential of cannabis, and then of course our hemp twine.
