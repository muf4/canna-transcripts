You only knew that Gaildo would help you get through to a
conference every hotel opened once
and the reason for that, sorry,
because I didn't know it was a hotel
turned out to be a hotel for glamour artists etc.
Those are some interesting points.
Ahe, what I would like to tell you is
I have a decent sentiment of lot of
documentaries from people I know
from things I've done and that,
a case by the person, but the ones who take on the power
of the organization, and they actually can
recognize them in a case by for example, the Roger server.
You know, it's a computer-based relationship, which is run from the two rows
to the five rows, which is sort of a natural
normal for what's replaced by after
testing concept for officials who take turns
on a regular state
observation, to really kind of
help the firm actually detect who this is, and what is the
symptom of a greater systemic problem, which is more
than just a natural normal for it. And in so many ways,
I think it helps to also
translate
and canvas computerized issues, and really
introduce them to the other people
who are in the process of having an industrial paradigm,
and to make sure that, to make sure that
the other people in the industry are being recognized and respected
for all these natural things that they'll be able to
actually be expected. And I don't know how many people
in this room have been aware of the shocking
and unoptimized effect that we've had on global health space, and to get
all of the players to expect.
So that's it for my presentation right now.
I will be here again in the fall to give you a kind of canvas
that you can look at, and also to start learning about systemic health services in this country.
