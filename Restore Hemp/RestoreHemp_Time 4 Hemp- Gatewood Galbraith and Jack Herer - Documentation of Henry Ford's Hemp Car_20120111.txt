I'll give you better photos. This is Mr. Henry Ford in 1941 with Popular Mechanics magazine showing off his car made from hemp.
Oh, is that when the whole car itself was made from hemp?
It says so right there in Popular Mechanics 1941. Is that nice? One more deal in the car. That's an eerie, I mean they should have never let us find that one.
