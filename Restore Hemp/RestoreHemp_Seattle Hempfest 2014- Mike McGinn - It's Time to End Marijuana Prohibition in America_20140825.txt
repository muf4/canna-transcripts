You know, five years ago, when I was running for mayor,
somebody asked me if I had a position on marijuana legalization.
And my answer then was, if every politician that ever smoked marijuana
voted to legalize it, it'd be legal in an instant.
Which is a funny line, right?
So, I didn't think it was a big deal when I ran for office five years
to come out for legalization.
The people of Seattle had voted to make it the lowest enforcement priority.
The state had medical marijuana.
But I later discovered it was kind of a big deal.
Lots of elected officials, lots of politicians weren't willing to do it yet.
And there were a couple before me.
Roger Goodman was in the statehouse, was a real leader, and there were others.
But there weren't that many.
Look at where it is five years later, right?
Five years ago, you had to explain why you were for it.
Today, I think if you're a politician, not just in the state of Washington,
but anywhere in the country, you're going to have to explain
why are you against it.
That's where this is going.
And it's amazing how quickly these things can move.
And they move because people organize.
Because people make a difference.
It doesn't happen because of political leaders.
Trust me.
Most politicians will only do what the public is willing to say they want them to do.
So you all made that happen.
But while I got you here, we're winning this issue.
There's another green issue we need to win.
And that's the fight against global warming.
That's something I've worked on too.
So I'm going to keep helping you all with pot legalization around the country,
having sensible laws.
And I want you all to help me in making sure that we make this planet right for our children.
And fight global warming, fight coal trades, fight oil trades,
and build a better future together.
Thank you.
