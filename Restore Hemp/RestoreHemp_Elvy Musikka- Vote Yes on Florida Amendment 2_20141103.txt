Hi, I'm LV Musica and I'm sending a very special message to the people of Florida,
especially South Florida, because they stood behind me 26 years ago when this loss had
had me incarcerated after I had already lost my better eye to lack of marijuana.
With your help and your support, I won and shortly thereafter became the first woman
to receive medical marijuana from the federal government as my medicine for the last 26
years.
Now I use it for arthritis, for insomnia, for depression, for all of the things that
strike us as we get older.
I don't have any, any pharmaceuticals in my medicine cabinet.
My medicine is God-given cannabis, hemp, marijuana.
Please vote yes on 2 and help the thousands of people who desperately need you now as
you helped me back then.
Thank you.
Vote on 2.
