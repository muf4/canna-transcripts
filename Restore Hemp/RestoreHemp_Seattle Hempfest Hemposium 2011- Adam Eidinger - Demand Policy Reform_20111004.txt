I just want to thank everyone who stuck around for our presentation here. It
means a lot to come out all the way from Washington DC and speak to all the
hempsters here. Everybody here is a hempster who came to Seattle HempFest
this year. You don't have to be working 24-7 in the hemp industry to be a
hempster. You can just you can become a member of Vote Hemp and the Hemp
Industry Association as a supporter. You don't have to be in the industry. So we
and that's one of the ways the industry has grown is through grassroots support.
And just I want to remind everyone once again it's been said a couple times but
we I really think we are the most powerful movement in America right now.
We don't act like it. We have to start acting like it and demanding change. And
any politician who blows you off when it comes to cannabis reform you just have
to tell them I'm not going away buddy. You're gonna go away if you don't act on
this issue. So anyway let's keep fighting together and stay united and and thanks
again for having me here. Word to wisdom from Adam never ever ever vote for
someone who considers you a criminal for a nonviolent offense.
