get this, just give me a call buddy. Right next to that we have, I'd be happy to
give this to Paul McCartney. Here we have a Park Davis product, neuralgia, and it
looks pretty potent. It's got morphine and cannabis and capsicum which will

are from Eli Lilly. These last four are all Eli Lilly. And who is the Senator

majority leader and in Congress the leading drug warrior, the
congressman whose committee appropriates the funds for the drug czar's office is
Souter of Indiana who is considered the congressman from Eli Lilly. Yeah and he's
the rabid drug warrior, the one who, he's from Eli Lilly but boy...
