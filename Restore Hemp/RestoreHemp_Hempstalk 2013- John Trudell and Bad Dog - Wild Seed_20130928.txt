And the earth is our mother.
And the land is her flesh.
And the water is her milk.
And the oil is her blood.
And we are her children.
In this land we come from, of this earth
we're made of, with us as future ancestors,
given response, abilities to live.
We are the future we bring.
If we don't take care of the land,
how can the land take care of us?
Same with sky and air we breathe.
Today is time to remember tomorrow
and the reality of we reap what we sow,
the reality of land and life is in the sea.
Sea has memory, memory of life, wild seed memory,
keeping alive alive, up close, face
to face with the destroyers and their synthetic seed
without memory.
Toxic planting poison in earth and minds,
disregarding well-being for maximizing profits,
abandoning the children to massive debt,
making the price of freedom unaffordable
at the expense of the many for the benefit of the few.
Like a spreading mad human disease,
chaos in minds with liar's promises,
seeding old fears with new fears,
life in the world of the money man.
It's time to think our way out of what we believed our way into.
How can we show respect to life if we don't use our common sense?
Wild seed, life seeding life, and the earth is our mother
and the land is her flesh and the water is her milk
and the oil is her blood and we are her children.
