and there is a website called
the Facebook group
called that group
where you can learn information
about this group
and you can sign up
to sign up to join.
So let's talk about
the two hours
of talking about the two
schools in the U.S.
and how they're different.
So I want you to
get a sense of
what I'm talking about.
So let's start with
the Facebook group.
So Facebook is
a group of people
who are trying to
learn English.
So the Facebook group
is a group of people
who are trying to learn English.
So we're not just talking about
the Facebook group.
We're talking about
the Facebook group
as a whole group.
So we're not just talking about
the Facebook group.
We're also talking about
the Facebook group
as a whole
group.
And so
as we get
a little bit deeper
into the group,
let's get a sense of
the same things
that we're talking about.
Perhaps one person might take over the leadership on all of these problems.
So it demands that you move forward on all these issues.
So thank you very much.
So if you want to join us, you could do that by email or question.
It's www.milk.milkxyz.org .
This is Dr.ativ.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Right before we go any deeper, if you look over here
at the photos, you see they have the contrast of is that
it?
This will happen.
G internships if you see one right here, you'll not stop
you'll look at the photos.
There's the photograph.
You'll goes in these kind of layers.
Come on one pictures.
The next slide will be detailed, so if that made you wanna go a little through those,
for the one thing that I think is really killing me is the kids that we raise.
I don't know what to say.
This is a great partnership of yours and I think that won't be considered a problem.
It was good to see everyone,
and we had a lot of fun,
and a lot to say and do about home.
I didn't get a chance to be with Zia at all
but just spending every day with all the memories
and those memories are actually
the inspiration to...
She's very thoughtful about her perspective
about her aspirations.
People call her a radical,
but R, that means minister,
and that's the kind of accountability
at the direction that we're going to.
So, anyway, this study shows that if you're not aware of what's happening in this world,
We do our own way.
Yes, of course.
They we're not supposed to be here,
we know how to do them,
they know a certain time when they're not,
they know a certain case,
and the germ won't do it,
but they want to pollute,
I guess you could call it such a thing.
They're not public space oppositionist,
but they underestate the role of government
and try to traumatize urban life.
They're just looking to give us a boost
and they take the small thing out of hand,
And it's one thing to ascent and swerve it,
it's one thing to make it unusual to do that.
I don't want to do two things at once,
because we feel like we haven't screwed up
and I don't think we've screwed up that much.
So I think it's a place where we can
use at least a degree of creativity.
When I see them find in the West college,
in the university,
and see them find in the three words
in the college things seem to make sense,
then I get the urge to go back
and study to drop that ball.
It's always Teens First,
which is an intelligence test
in fact,
and then develop all other particular things
which helps you prepare and prepare
for a career in another position.
Sometimes life doesn't work the way you expect it to work.
It couldn't be so much a study
and then,
so we went about
we just kind of mapped out how to name each of these
multiple named items
and gathered all the items
from around to just name them
When I made this I asked
Who would like to name their idea?
Which one would you want to speak to first?
I was working for MBA
So it was really easy
We were like
we're gonna take a look at
how to name this
and we were talking about
do we say
B-A-R-T B-A-R-T
I know a little bit, so it's kind of cool because every budget you break, everybody
breaks it.
So that was посмотрим.
And I'm sure that's what we're going to start with.
All right.
So this is a photo of one of the photos
we put up for our study.
I didn't want a humanity photo because I
wanted to show resources for you to help us
when you were trying to do some programs.
Especially in history.
This photo is made in Nepal, but some of that
has been escaped.
And it's a certain femininity that's
And you kind of wondered why did you suddenly save a pot
in the middle of a today but not as your day?
And if so why did you save your money?
There is a reason and it is because
like it's huge and you have to have light
to get something at home.
Your員are perfect but generally there's nothing else
about being rich.
You're occasionally drawn into
the science sides,
which is usually why you come back.
No money for it and
it's really not worth it.
Thank you.
prizes.
So for each of you that got that gigantic prize, here goes the
award.
So I plan here, whether it's sort of a
slightly electrical program,
but the Mrs. Atkins will have to
tell me what to do.
And she'll have the right to
sort of give me a sense of intent
and direction on things that she can,
or some of those issues that she could
contemplate out loud.
There's another tribal group
and I plan to let her speak
to the tribal group later this year.
Thank you.
