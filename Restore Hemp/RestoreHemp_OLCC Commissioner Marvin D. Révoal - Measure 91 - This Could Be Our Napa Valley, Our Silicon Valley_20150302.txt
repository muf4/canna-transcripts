Good afternoon everyone. My name is Marvin Revolve and I represent Congressional District Number 4, which is Lane County, the central part of the state, Congressman DeFazio's area.
I'm excited about what's going on right now. I own a commercial brokerage, insurance brokerage, and we have offices in Portland and Eugene.
So I get to see a lot of businesses, small businesses, large businesses.
I happen to believe that this could be our Napa Valley, our Silicon Valley, if we do it right. And we are meant to be doing it right.
I think that the rest of the country is looking at Oregon right now. We have, we're number three.
There have been some mistakes that have been made in the other two states. We're hoping to avoid those.
We want to hear from you. We're going to start making rules later on this year with the idea that this becomes an economic engine.
One of the goals that I have is that in the coming year, this next biennium, Oregon liquor control is going to deliver to the state of Oregon $1.2 billion.
That's what liquor, wine, and beer does to the state. Remember, we don't have a consumption tax.
So I want to be as excited to one day say, guess what? The cannabis industry produced $1.2 billion for the state of Oregon.
And maybe we can build a library once in a while. So thank you.
