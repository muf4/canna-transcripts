Every day's a new day, little boy.
The way things are going, they're bound to turn.
So you learn to do the skip step, wayoy.
You know things ain't always right.
We who want it, we're caught up in a fight.
But we who love life, we're caught up in a hope.
Because we see through the veil and we know how to cope.
So keep your head up, make your bed.
Things are what they are, no need to feel dread.
They say that it's dark just before the dawn.
So hold your vibe and you'll get along.
Every day's a new day, little boy.
The way things are going, they're bound to turn.
So you learn to do the skip step, wayoy.
If you stumble, you're bound to crash and burn.
If you ain't got it all, time to start with just a little.
Time to start somewhere and pick yourselves up.
Things don't always go just the way that you plan it,
Willie boy.
No worry, no hurry now, Billy boy.
No worry, no hurry now, Billy boy.
Billy boy.
