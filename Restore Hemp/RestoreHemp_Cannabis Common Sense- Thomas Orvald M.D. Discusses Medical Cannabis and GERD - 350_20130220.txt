Disease and tonight we're going to talk about a strange disease called GERD. It's a
gastro esophageal
reflux disease there are a number of people
that have
this
problem and it's very distressing because when you swallow your food
Normally you feel no
Untoward effects, but in people who have GERD they have severe indigestion now
Indigestion is one thing but severe indigestion
Secondary to GERD has some ominous implications and bear with me for just a minute. I'm going to draw you a quick
picture of the stomach
Now when you swallow food comes down the esophagus
and it goes through a little valve that is positioned right here and
That valve allows the food to go into the stomach
But it doesn't allow any of the gastric acid that's in the stomach that is responsible for breaking down
The material that you've swallowed in other words food comes down
But it doesn't go up in people who have gastro esophageal reflux disease
They have a
valve that is non-functional as soon as food hits the stomach the stomach agitates the food and
cells along the lining of the stomach
are called parietal cells and they
Secrete acid that helps break down food products
Well, what what's above the little valve here? It's our
Esophagus it's the same tissue as your skin
So if acid from the stomach goes up into the esophagus
It burns the esophagus just like it would be if you poured acid on your skin. Well, that is the flaw in
Gastroesophageal reflux disease there are surgical
Procedures that are helpful in controlling this but many times the symptoms themselves
can be ameliorated with the judicious use of
cannabis, so if this
Area here is not functional and
Acid gets flushed up into your esophagus. You experience the burning if we can control that
The patient feels a lot better and last but not least
the cells that are lining the esophagus right here are
Skin cells over a long period of time
acid being flushed up into those skin cell areas and
Burned can cause a bad problem called cancer of the esophagus
It's the so-called Barrett's disease of the esophagus. So if we can
discourage the ongoing flush of acid into that area and
Discourage the pain we have helped the patient
Thank you doctor. Thank you
