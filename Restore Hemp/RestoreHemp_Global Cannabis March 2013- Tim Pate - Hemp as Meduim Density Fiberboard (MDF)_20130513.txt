I met a group of people out in Harrisburg, Oregon, who decided that they would like to import hemp,
excuse me, from Spain through France. And so we did, and we had to get the DEA's permission.
So we imported this hemp, and then we took that hemp and we made boards out of it.
This is really a nice guitar, and this is a really old piece of wood. The wood is older than the
guitar. So what's going on is I've got this piece of wood that's 20 years old, and it hasn't aged
today, right? And it was made out of hemp fibers that we imported from Spain through France.
And we were able to prove through this piece of wood right here, or actually medium density fiber
board, that we could actually create medium density fiber board. And that because of that,
we have the ability to change the dynamic in the woods, okay? Now we proved this 20 years ago,
but because we do not have anywhere in the world, we do not have enough adequate supply
to actually do it. I mean nobody's growing hemp fields in the United States unless you run out
in Nebraska and get some of the ditch weed. I mean it is everywhere, you know it is, you've seen it.
And that's what's going on, you know, we just don't have a real supply. If we ever had a supply,
I mean tomorrow, we could be producing boards out of hemp. We could be turning all the herd in the
inside of the stock into viscose and making, you know, chairs for astronauts that will never break.
You know, we could do things that you couldn't, you can't even imagine, but we actually can because
we've got a big imagination. So one of the reasons that I keep fighting, and I've been doing this for
over 30 years, is I believe, I believe, I believe.
