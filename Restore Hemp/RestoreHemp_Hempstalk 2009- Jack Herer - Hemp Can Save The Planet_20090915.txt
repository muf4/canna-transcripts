For the one and only Jack Herrer everybody. Jack Herrer.
Some of these people know me from 1984.
I came up here to Oregon.
And Washington.
We bid an initiative over and over and over and over again.
We bought a store. We put on the store.
In 98 passed the initiative.
We got it for medicine.
Years before that we bought it for medicine in California.
And Dennis put in 150,000 signatures and we passed it on the ballot.
For medicine. And we got it all over the fucking state except for red lips.
San Diego.
14 years after we passed the law.
And it's still going up.
I'm going to tell you. There's nothing fucking better for the human race than having marijuana morning, noon and night.
You live two years longer than people that don't smoke and don't drink.
And eight to 24 years longer than people that do.
You gotta be out of your mind not to smoke dope.
Once you know this, not even two years longer if you smoke it.
If you eat the seed out of three million seeds and foodstuff on earth.
The number one thing in the whole world is hemp from one to a hundred before you get to soybeef.
One to a hundred.
The first, second, third, fiftieth, ninetieth, a hundred.
Chains of everything on earth.
And the number one chain to a hundred is hemp seed.
And that's against the law.
We didn't know it in public school, high school or college.
I didn't know that 98% of all the food and clothing of the whole world was hemp.
And it's the best thing the world has ever had.
I thought the United States government won the fucking, I thought they had showed us fucking jail.
But to getting you and me the safest thing you can do in the universe.
And that is what we're going to do in California.
Okay?
Come over to my booth.
Over there.
And I will see you next time.
Let's give it up for Jack Herrera everybody.
