I used to listen to my boy Ricky James.
He used to sing about this son he called the girl maintain.
I never understood what he was so in love with this woman,
but now Rick I know exactly where you probably was coming from.
Ever since I met Miss Mary Jane, your boy and my friends from.
Now I roll it to my old school, take it to the parties
that I roll to.
I love the girl, man.
She gives me that feeling that I want to give back.
That's why I'm in love with you.
Mary Jane's the truth.
You give me that.
Feel like I never felt before.
That's why I want to see you all in love.
