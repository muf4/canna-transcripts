Hi everyone, my name is Brian DeSente. I'm an attorney and I run Sensible Colorado,
which is a nonprofit organization in Colorado. We've been around since 2004
and our work is sort of bifurcated. We're the lead organization that works on
behalf of Colorado's medical marijuana patients and a fascinating fact there is
is about two years ago there were maybe 4,000 Colorado medical marijuana
patients and there's over a hundred thousand today so our phone... let's give a round of applause.
Our phones certainly ring quite a bit more now than they did two years ago
which is a little overwhelming. We also, Sensible Colorado, we also work on
broader marijuana reform issues and I've really for my entire professional career
been working to dismantle the war on drugs and as much as... and so I guess I'm
happy to follow the senator because I think we have to move on multiple fronts.
It's wonderful to see legislators taking this up but what can citizens do, right?
What can your average Joe do? And I think to some extent Colorado has sort of
forged a path which has been a roadmap for other states and other activists
maybe to get involved in. I think we are really close to ending the government's
war on marijuana in Colorado. I think that'll happen within a couple years and
it has not been an easy road. We've learned a lot of lessons and I just kind
of want to lay out a little of what we've done. The underlying kind of theme
of what... where the activism has been at in Colorado is we've been all about
forcing the discussion of this issue and as a, you know, when I graduated law
school in 2004 and of course my classmates were going on to firm jobs
and you know working in the corporate world or perhaps being a district
attorney. I didn't hang out with those people but you know public defender or
what have you. You know I said well I'm actually gonna work on marijuana reform.
You know I worked for MPP for a little while and then got Sensible Colorado
going and honestly people kind of laughed and didn't take me seriously and
we're sort of like well you know this is this is kind of a joke and I think we've
seen an evolution where you know those same people that would not return my
phone calls, where there's legislators that I just wanted to talk about the
you know the word marijuana would just turn people off. I really think we've
gone from from marijuana you know just people snickering when they've heard
that to this being a legitimacy a legitimate policy issue right and the
way I think we've done that is by forcing people to say the word marijuana
to read the word marijuana to hear about marijuana on the news whether it's
medical patients or students standing up and saying you know we're tired of
policies that push us towards using alcohol which is a much more dangerous
drug we should be able to allow... should be allowed to use marijuana in the
dorms or at parties and not be punished, not kicked out of school for using a
less harmful drug and so really I think that discussion has been key to getting
people like the senator and people like senators in Colorado to to consider this
issue more seriously and to to begin to tackle it. In short you know what
happened in Colorado on a recreational front was really kicked off by students
in 2004 and we had two of the biggest universities in our state Colorado
University in Boulder which had 50,000 plus people and then Colorado State
University in Fort Collins take on the issue of marijuana versus alcohol right
and it was led by my brave brothers and sisters at SAFER that I
work with and I was involved to some extent but essentially students saying
enough is enough we want our policies at least at least in the student level
right in our handbook in our in our University Code to reflect the fact that
that marijuana penalties should not be greater than the penalties for alcohol
and both of those measures passed right so it's a kind of a radicalized student
movement to kick-start this in Colorado and that was then launched into Denver
the capital capital of Colorado initiative campaign was run much like
it's gonna be happening here in 2011 where enough citizens get together
enough citizens sign a piece of paper and you can put something you can
bypass the legislature right put put use direct democracy put it in front of the
people and that's exactly what happened in Denver and I worked to some extent on
that campaign and I got to tell you nobody thought it was gonna win right
nobody thought it was gonna win and at the end of the day Denver you know
essentially a city of two million people became the first city in history to
legalize marijuana right worldwide and this is just enormous you know and maybe
idealist like myself thought well now that we have actually changed the Denver
marijuana law our city code to say that adults 21 and older should not be
punished for possessing marijuana maybe things will change and in fact the
arrest continued and it's kind of maddening to me and other activists and
probably to many voters that said you know this is bullshit you know we voted
on this and the police have not really respected that so moving on from there a
statewide push was run the net the following year it only got 41% but 41%
ain't bad you know we've shown that we're actually gaining support every
year we went back to Denver with another initiative in 2007 which was the lowest
law enforcement priority initiative very similar to what Seattle has in that
basically says for police and prosecutors marijuana possession should
be the lowest priority and we appointed a mayor's panel I serve on that panel in
the chair actually and the vice chairs a police officer it's uncomfortable
meetings sometimes but you know we've seen a sort of downward trend I think in
the arrests which has been positive so the other quick aspect you know we've
had some other action in Colorado people in Breckenridge people in Durango
people in smaller cities we've gotten together and changed their local laws
and all that helps me it really gets news out there and and and all of these
events all of these changes in our laws are accompanied by people like me people
like you writing press releases sending it out you know emailing out press
releases getting having a press conferences things like that that maybe
can be seem a little intuitive we're not taught how to do that in law school
or in college frankly but it's incredibly important to do to get the
word out so you're actually reaching a broader audience you're getting people
to think about marijuana to read about it in their local paper in the state
paper you know your stunts on the news that sort of thing you know can just be
incredibly useful you know the medical marijuana stuff in Colorado we've of
course it was initially brought on by the people in 2000 we got our medical
marijuana law and then we've had this just incredible growth in our program
which which I pointed out and that actually led to the legislature picking
this up so again we have the people kind of driving the boat and eventually eight
years after our law passed the actually ten years after our law passed the
legislature decided oh well we're actually going to regulate this and we
passed as an absolute landmark piece of legislation last year in the Colorado
legislative session which is the most comprehensive framework for marijuana
regulation in the world I don't know but we now have about a thousand licensed
dispensaries we also and these are state licensed right there they ain't going
away we also have about 200 to 300 edible producers who are separately
licensed and they're all being taxed and and if you know I think some skeptics
may say well this this may last this may not last and to me what what shows me
that it's actually going to last is we have a state constitution that protects
patients we also have a couple state laws but then perhaps the most important
factor is we have an a hundred person wing of our Department of Revenue whose
job it is to oversee these marijuana regulations yeah it's a sort of
there's a hundred government jobs that's awesome millions and millions of dollars
coming into our state economy to regulate these these medical marijuana
businesses and so you know citizens certainly get involved we were down
there every day at the Capitol trying to either do damage control or push
provisions of that law which would help patients and help their providers and to
a large degree we're successful so I'm gonna stop going babbling on and turn
things over to Douglas but I look forward to a dialogue later on thanks
