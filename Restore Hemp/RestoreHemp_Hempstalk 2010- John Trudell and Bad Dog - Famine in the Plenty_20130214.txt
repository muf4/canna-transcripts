Famine in the printing
Patience burns quick
Waiting for the rich
But the rich won't hurry
The rich eat us
So, the rich don't worry
♪
In the sun's shadow
Water melts into coal
Running rivers of want
Want needs justice
But justice is just ice
In those rivers of want
The stars in the night
Have seen it all
What isn't remembered
Takes time to eat
The soul isn't empty
Yet, it feels that way

Waiting for the rich
But the rich won't hurry
The rich eat us
So, the rich don't worry
♪
All those stolen moments
Still searching to belong
The scent of heaven calls
The prayers of the praying
Feeling something missing
A constant of every day
♪
Confusion in the happy place
The big lie is one
With all the little lies
Edges of breaking dreams
Cutting into other dreams
