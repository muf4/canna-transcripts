Thank you all so very much for being here this evening.
We're here for a worthy cause, but before that,
just let me say, Jack, your spirit will never die.
You know, I want to ask each and every one of you here today
to please, please get out there and help us re-legalize
cannabis.
You know, I tell this to people every day.
We have these huge meetings at Organ Normal,
200 people at a time coming to look for the medicine.
But they lose their jobs.
They lose their children through child custody battles.
Divorces get ugly, and they bring in,
you're a medical marijuana patient.
You don't deserve to have your kids.
That's bullshit, and I'm tired of it.
I'm fed up with my people getting arrested every day.
It is bullshit, and we're going to change that
because we're going to pass the Octo-Cannabis Tax Act, where
people can go and burn bats and be afraid of the man.
But it's going to take each and every one of you
to put the joint down, step away from your bong
just for a little while, write a letter, send a fax,
make a phone call.
Don't just sit there and take this shit anymore.
That's right.
We're going to do it, and we're going to do it
because Jett taught us well.
And he knew the power of him.
He knew it could save our planet.
So everybody, remember this day.
Remember he gave his life to this movement.
And now we owe it to him to re-legalize marijuana.
Then each of us has one small voice.
But together, we are a giant roar that
can shake the halls of Congress.
Please help me legalize him.
Thank you so very much.
