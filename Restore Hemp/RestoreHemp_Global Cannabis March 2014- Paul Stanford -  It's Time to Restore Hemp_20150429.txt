It's the most productive crop, produces more fuel from its seed oil and its biomass and ethanol,
more fiber from its stems for canvas, rope, lace, linen, paper, building materials,
and more food from its seeds, the best protein known to man. So to take the oldest and most
productive crop and to prohibit that one is evil. And we're here to protest that, to restore hip to
its rightful place in our economy. If you look right up there, where that Mark Emery sign is
being held, that's the starting point of the march. So we're going to start when we come back.
Congressman Earl Blumenauer will be here to give our keynote speech and a number of other speakers
and music for a few hours this afternoon. Again, I want to thank you all for coming.
Line up for the march and help us restore him.
