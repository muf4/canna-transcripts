I'm here to talk just a little bit about the hemp stock. We've been denied the
permit to put on hemp stock this year, some you probably know, so we asked the
court to review the decision-making process of the Park Service. It sounds to
me like hearing Madeline here today, hearing her say don't smoke marijuana,
put your joint down. That doesn't sound like the Madeline I know. It sounds to
me like her free speech rights have been tampered with, just like Paul Stanford's
were. We're told what to say from the stage now by the city, but we filed a
suit for a writ of review and we argued it last week, had a little flurry
of brief writing after that. We should get a decision next week whether there
will be a hemp stock 2015 or not, but the reason it was denied is because some
people smoked marijuana down on the waterfront, so that's probably why
Madeline is having to warn you guys. The city can crack down on us anytime. Free
speech in the state of Oregon, however, we have a constitutional amendment, a
constitutional provision that's not even an amendment, and there's a similar case
under the federal law out of Ferguson. It seemed that the police officers
in Ferguson were telling people to move along, move along, move along, keep moving.
You can't stand here and talk about the shootings. You can't talk about
government. You can't talk about anything. Just keep moving, keep moving. So they
sued in federal court and just quite recently, last year, the federal court
said no, you can't make people just keep moving along. The reason is it doesn't
work. It's not narrowly tailored to solve your problems. It just stops them talking
and you can't stop people from saying what they want to say. I'm hoping that
that's the same result we'll have next week and that we'll all be volunteering
and planning for hemp stock. Meanwhile, keep speaking because that's what got us
here. Thank you all.
