The voters of the state of Washington passed an initiative and the voters in the city of Vancouver passed that initiative by an even larger margin, 54%.
They said yes to the legalization of recreational use of marijuana.
We're pleased in the city of Vancouver to support the voters of our community.
We're going to have six, up to six businesses operating in the city.
I'm happy to be here to kick off this opportunity with Main Street Marijuana.
I'm pleased to see so much energy and excitement around this from our community.
So please enjoy, do it safely, do it within the law, support our local business.
I'm proud of what these guys have accomplished.
I know they want to be good neighbors.
They've outreached to the businesses and the neighbors here in Uptown Village.
And I think this is a great, this is a great turning of a new chapter for the city of Vancouver.
Thank you to each and every one of you.
Keep getting yourself a drink.
