What groups or organizations or individuals have inspired you in your life?
Well, listen, if it wasn't for an extremely good mama and the threat of Eddyville maximum security prison, I'd have gone wrong a really long time ago.
So my mama probably kept me on straight and narrow more than anybody else.
But as I got older, I became desperate for a role model.
And so I looked for the people who I thought stood for the right things.
They're hard to find.
So I decided, quite frankly, I decided that this society needs a new hero and there's no reason in the world why I shouldn't be it.
Every generation must win its own freedom.
And our past generation had such icons as faulty as they were as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood as being a sovereign individual and human beings.
But this younger generation doesn't have any heroes.
I mean, Ben Diesel is not a hero.
He's the only person who's ever been a hero.
You know, and all these, kill them all, kind of kung fu masters.
You know, they aren't the heroes.
The heroes are people like Gary Cooper in High Noon, like who shot Liberty Valley.
When somebody who's just trying to do right has to stand up against some unspeakable villain who threatens the very freedom and soul of the protagonist.
You know, I guess my heroes nowadays are Lex Valessa and that Chinese gentleman who stood in front of that tank in Santa Cruz Square.
Yeah, unknown rebel.
Individuals who take individual action are a major problem.
