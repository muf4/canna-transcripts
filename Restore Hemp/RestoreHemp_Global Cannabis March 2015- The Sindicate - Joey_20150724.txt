This next song is about marijuana.
Thank you guys very much.
If I had one hundred dollars for every blunt I'd smoke
Every joint I've choked I'd be rich
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh
And if I could just breathe in and burst one last time
Whoa, that high, that high would be mine
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I won't eat you
Too much longer, longer
I won't eat you
Too much longer to be high, yeah
And if I had just one last wish, it would be one more hit
Whoa, I'll quit when I'm dead
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I won't eat you
Too much longer, longer
I won't eat you
Too much longer to be high, yeah
If I had one hundred dollars for every blunt I've smoked
Every joint I've choked, I'd be rich
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I won't eat you
Too much longer, longer
I won't eat you
Too much longer to be high, yeah
