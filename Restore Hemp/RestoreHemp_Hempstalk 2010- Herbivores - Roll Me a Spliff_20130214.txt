Once again, vote.
Look, they could do this in California.
You know, we could do it in Oregon.
Then we could get it going in Washington.
We could take this thing all around the country.
Get that majority and keep it.
And stop being the silenced majority.
You know, there's a few people out there in the land speaking against all of us.
And you know what? There's only a few of them, really.
But they're the ones with the airwaves.
We are the silenced majority.
We're not a minority.
We need to get out there and support it.
Make it happen.
Because we can do it, man.
Talk to everybody you know.
Talk to your local police officer.
Talk to your minister.
Talk to your husband, your wife, your kids, your mom, your dad, your grandma, your grandpa.
And you know, because once the truth is out, who's going to keep this thing illegal like this?
Who's going to stop, you know?
I mean, when's it going to stop?
When does it end?
So, meanwhile, what are we here for?
We're here to have a good time.
We're here for you.
We are the silenced majority.
We need to get out there and support it.
Make it happen.
Because we can do it, man.
Talk to everybody you know.
Talk to your local police officer.
Talk to your minister.
Talk to your wife, your kids, your grandma, your grandma.
And you know, because once the truth is out, who's going to keep this thing illegal like this?
We're here to have a good time.
When does it end?
When does it happen?
That's what I'm talking about.
I see people out there looking for the answer.
