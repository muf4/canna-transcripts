And now here's the host of your show Paul Stanford and Paul Loney
Hello and welcome to another exciting edition of cannabis common sense
We are a production our show is a production of our Oregon political committee
campaign for the restoration and regulation of hemp and
We sponsor a petition here in Oregon the Oregon cannabis tax act and we are in the final month of our petition drive
We need your signatures. I'm one of the chief petitioners on that
My name is Paul Stanford and I'd like to introduce you
to our attorney
he is also our treasurer a fellow chief petitioner on the Oregon cannabis tax act and
The president of the Oregon Wildlife Federation, mr. Paul Loney
Thanks, Paul. We're back again the two Paul's
Paul said we're here to talk about our initiative among other things and to bring some common sense to this
this
Whole sort of war on drugs madness war on some drugs madness, you know to provide you with the answers
Then you know and then maybe if you have questions call us up and leave us those questions
We'll try and answer those but we do have a phone number in our office
503 two three five four six. Oh six. That's our phone number. You can call there and get more petitions
ask questions about our petition and
And that's also, you know on our petitioners addressed a mail them back in once you have signatures on there
And we need them all back now if you've got signatures now is the time to mail them back to us
we have to have all of our signatures by the end of this month by the end of June and
If you have them mail them in if you don't have them call us at this number two three five four six. Oh six
Yeah, definitely, you know, we're here to
To try and get this initiative on a ballot to get to the debate out there some real information
This is on a ballot. We're gonna have real debate
Real facts getting out there something that's missing right now
That's when the reason why you know, we found that our our show here cameras common sense is so popular
Is that we're providing common sense?
You know some real answers about this whole issue and I'm sure it's probably some of our you know
Portland's finest watching this show and you know, it's like I like you folks if you're watching to stop and think about it
You know, it's just like, you know thing about what you're doing and and why you're doing it
I mean, it's just it's just hopefully it's not because you're following orders. Hopefully it's not because you want that next paycheck
Yeah, stop tyranny
Stop arresting non-violent marijuana offenders support the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act call us you want to tell them what octa will do?
Well, yeah, thanks Paul for reminding me
octa will
Will allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to patients at cost
Through they can then pick up at a pharmacy. You can go to your local
you know Rite Aid or
Walgreens or Fred Meyer or any any pharmacy of your choosing and and pick up your prescription there a lot easier than
Trying to find a black market
Another thing it'll do it will allow our farmers to grow industrial hemp
In which they will give them
Put them in the forefront of the emerging market around the world for industrial hemp
You know cannabis taken off on industrial hemp movement now Europe's been on it for a few years now
The u.s. Has fallen behind and this new emerging market
It's like if say 20 years ago the u.s.
Said ban computers here the rest of world would have leaped ahead with
Computers and we'd be sitting here doing nothing and and it's a good thing we didn't you know
And a good analogy because right now our farmers are falling farther and farther behind Canada this year has
Allowed the first commercial hemp crop yeah, so in Europe. It's subsidized more than any other crop
Yeah, because they realize the benefits of it
Which we can get a little bit later, but the other main aspect of our initiative which would do would be allow
sale to adults
A lot of sale of marijuana to adults through state run stores
I eat the liquor store system or in
Bars and clubs the bars and clubs would have to sell alcohol right, but they'd be licensed and run
Just like a the bars are today
You know it's right right. Yeah, you know so it's regulated
So you know people know what's going on and then that way no miners can't have access
And then of course that would that would be that aspect would be taxed
You're right right now adult recreational sales would be taxed, and I think that would raise more money than the lottery
We really can't quantify it
Officially well, and then also to I mean people are thinking more and more about
You know the large not such a good thing
I mean there was a proposed initiative this year about banning lottery here in Oregon, but they backed off for a while
I think partly because they realized there wasn't a replacement revenue
But something like this could be the replacement revenue for a lottery a lot of people don't like the lottery because especially video poker
Lot of people get addicted to that so easily and then there goes our whole paycheck
and and so this could be the way you know this could be the answer and
Part of our gonna raise a lot of money when we regulate marijuana
Yeah, if Oregon's the first state to regulate the sale of marijuana to adults
Then we're gonna put our industries at the forefront of an exciting new industry
We're gonna
Just make lots and lots of money their farmers are going to be happy the tourism industry is going to be happy
The liquor store owners are going to be happy the bars and coffee shops that get a license and don't let minors in
They're going to be happy well
And all the small little crafters out there who can take industrial hemp products and make them into clothing
You know with different fiber make it into food
Make it into oil. There's a lot of things they can do and you know I think that
we'll have a much healthier population here because of the
Medicinal use you know being you know it because it'll be up to a doctor and a patient for what it's prescribed for
You know there's not a checkoff list saying okay?
This is what only your only way you can prescribe on things you can prescribe marijuana for in this list here
You know it's like now
It's up to the doctor and up to the patient because we know that you know medical science
You know they're discover new things every single day, and so who's to say that tomorrow?
They might find another good use medical use for for cannabis. It's true. You know there's several different compounds in
Cannabis or marijuana that have medicinal benefits a lot of people talk about THC or tetrahydrocannabinol
And that's useful for lowering nausea however if you're pretty nauseous might be hard to keep that pill down
There are other things though that
THC
Doesn't treat, but that marijuana does and that's because it has other compounds that are medicinally
effective one of them is cannabidiol or CBD and that controls muscle spasms and
Has an analgesic effect then there's CBC and
Cannabichromy and that is an antibiotic and has some other medicinal properties
Those drugs aren't available by prescription. They're not synthesized and sold
Pharmaceutically the way that marijuana is so we want our farmers and
Industries to have access to just those items so that they can
Raise lots and lots of money. You know yeah, I think it's you know it's a fascinating thing and you know one thing
I want to talk about is how just
fairly recently in Washington County
For the first times that I'm aware of an attorney was able to raise the choice of evils defense in a case of a patient
Multiple sclerosis patient who was found growing some plants
You know this patient said that he tried
You know you know buying on a street in a black market, but that was expensive, and it was scary
You know he didn't like having to drive. You know down to Portland here when the cannabis
Buyers Club was operating he didn't you know he didn't like that whole scene and so he just you know grew a few plants at his
home there
Because it helped him out. He said he helped much men as multiple sclerosis. I've seen multiple sclerosis patients use marijuana
I've seen them locked in a spasm where they're almost convulsant and
Taking they couldn't swallow a pill and keep it down and wait an hour for it to take effect
But a puff or two of marijuana helps yeah, what you know and that's what this gentleman said then and he was able to
They brought in a doctor who testified that yes, he's seen you know it work and documented case he had documented
Scientific study of this patient and MS
elsewhere and it worked and they
Although the jury still convicted this person
I think it's a victory the fact that the media reported the fact that there was a choice of us defense and a medical doctor
testifying as an expert
That the fact that marijuana is effective
For multiple sclerosis. I mean I you know think it's a great victory
You know overall for the movement, but it's you know a defeat for the individual right you know this individual
I mean, I hope that
You know that they don't sentence them too harshly
Now he said he didn't want to be a poster boy for the legalization of marijuana movement
But he was willing to accept that role because he shoved upon him well
We don't need to shove this role of a convicted felon this role of
Deviance on any more people yeah, especially a you know a patient a medical user somebody who has you know a
Horrible disease condition, I'm not sure if it's called disease or condition, but somebody who has this
I mean, it's just I mean people have this you know
it's just horrible to have and you know and I think anybody who knows
an MS patient
realize that they definitely have
great benefits from using marijuana and medicinally and
And so once again folks give us a call so we can get this initiative on the ballot and
So allow doctors and patients to have freedom to choose and freedom of privacy what to prescribe
503
235 4606
And we need registered organ voters to sign our petition and circulate our petition
If you only get your own signature on there or yourself and your partner signature
That's great send that back in if you've got them in there and sit down your dresser at home
Mail that back in now as Paul said this is the last month. This is crunch time. Yeah, we're
Rapidly counting down to the end of our petition drive
we need all of our signatures by the end of this month by the end of June if
If it comes down to the last week of June, and you've got some signatures for us
Don't put those in the mail call us at this number
We'll come and get them or you can come drop them off at our office
Anyway, call us and get involved. We're looking to contract with petitioners right now to pay them for circulating our petitions
So if you need work, or you know someone who needs to earn some money call us at this number
235 4606 and we'll pay you you know some petitioners earn a lot of money
I would say the average petitioner out there
It's going to earn about 20 or 25 dollars an hour a lot of petitioners can earn better than that so call us at 2 3 5
4 6 0 6 1 petitioner just last week got over
1,300 signatures on octa in a four-day workweek
and
There's more
That people can do so call us 2 3 5 4 6 0 6 yeah and
Getting back to our discussion on the medicinal use of marijuana. You know there's a
increasing oh
Dialogue going on right now among cannabis activists cannabis users about the fact that
People are saying more and more that all use of cannabis is medicinal that we shouldn't
Be afraid to state that that the fact that everybody uses it to whether it's to relax and unwind that's like medicine
I mean like some people take an aspirin to help them relax after you know a little headache after a hard day of running or
You got through your muscles are tight or playing tennis
whatever or some people relax with a
You know alcohol and and to that that's medicine. You know anything that anything that changes your state of mind is
Medicine according to some definitions, and you know people say we shouldn't be afraid of that to say that all use is
Medicinal and
And it should be up to the to the user to decide how they want to medicate themselves
Exactly and in a lot of cases people are medicating themselves medicinally
For a variety of different things that aren't recognized traditionally in science like depression
I've known people who have depression who've given up very dangerous drugs and just use marijuana and find that it
Controls their depression better than the very dangerous drugs do yeah
I mean, it's just you know I mean, I'd say I think it's just an interesting dialogue
It's starting to happen among some people who are who are just have the checklist mentality of you know marijuana is only good for these
these
Specified things and and if you try and say it's good for anything else why then you're just you know
Harming the cause and and I don't know I'm still learning myself on that
But I'm trying to think that more and more you know all use of cannabis is medicinal
I know that dialogue is really taking place in California
which is in sort of at the forefront these days of medical marijuana and
the attacks by the federal government and the California Attorney General and
You were mentioning earlier today about the would you happen down there with Dennis Perone exactly Dennis Perone was one of the people who?
Came up with the concept of
Pushing for medical marijuana politically through the initiative process he passed an initiative in the city of San Francisco
back in
back, I think it was like 77 that
Got 70% of the vote the highest plurality in any
election ever in San Francisco for medical marijuana passed another citywide San Francisco proposition to
De-emphasize and defund all
Marijuana enforcement by the city of San Francisco
Then back in 95 and 96 he organized a statewide medical marijuana petition known as the compassionate use
California's for compassionate use and that passed and it's
Caused the federal government a lot of heartaches
headaches I should say
And a good thing too because it's brought the debate to the forefront
Yeah, it is
I mean it's it makes the federal government look like hypocrites if they take medicine away from people you know in a state where
California said marijuana is medicine, then here's the government coming in taking away people's medicine
I mean, you know it just bad PR. You know they you know they still don't know how to deal with it yet
They've raided some of club down there, and then Dennis Perone had to close his club, correct
Yeah, he said and admitted that he had helped other supply marijuana to other clubs
and that wasn't specifically written into his initiative and so
the
Judge reluctantly said signed an order to close the club
but the police chief and the district attorney in San Francisco Hallinan and the
Mayor Willie Brown all said that they support the club and the next day it
Reopened and Hazel Rogers took over the Cannabis Buyers Club in San Francisco the largest in the nation and
she's a 72 year old grandmother and
the city endorses her
running the club and
the
State government and the feds tried to close it down in a subsequent injunction, but the judge wouldn't issue the injunction
So that's where it stands as of when we're taping
Exactly, and then you know part of it was the fact that he was supplying to other clubs
But also he was also
He's a firm believer than all use is medicinal exactly and you might say he's
He as far as I know he came up with that concept
Yeah, I mean, I and and that's he was the one that's you know brought to the forefront
You know even for that you know for the checklist mentality folks
You know there's two two camps in California people for medical marijuana
there's you know Dennis Perrone and other people saying that's like whatever whatever doctor and a patient want and
then there's the checklist folks that saying it's only for only for these things and the
The checklist folks had a lot of money still a lot of money, but they're losing the you know the public
Opinions not on their side a public opinion in California saying it's like what's the big deal?
You know it's up to the individual you know and when their doctor
You know our initiative goes just a little bit farther than that we implement the production of marijuana
according to the guidelines of
International treaty now the courts have ruled that international treaties have the same weight as the Constitution, so we complied
with the
Condition set by the single convention treaty in the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act we use their
specific
controls in terms of the licensing requirements
Requirements under the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act yeah
You know and of course now that there's a movement of fun a front foot in the United Nations to change that you know single
Convention to make it stronger because they realize people like us and other people around the world are starting to say hey
You know this is a way to regulate it to get it back from you know the underground and and the black market bring it
above ground so exactly we pioneered that so there's you know there's movement of foot to
Tighten it all up, and so it's real interesting. You know I know there's you know folks over in Europe right now being really strong
Keep an eye on that
Because they've got a strong movement over there and a lot of these they had a big March in London recently
So that's you know and didn't get a lot of publicity here in us of course
You know it was a major major March and protest in London and about
Freeing cannabis and right, but you know if they're trying to
Strengthen the treaties to stop our ability to do it. We better strike now while the iron is hot hot we better
Seize the day
Carpe diem call us at two three five four six
Oh six because you need to get involved to stop the war on drugs
As I've often said and Paul might be getting tired and you too hearing the war on drugs
I firmly believe is the issue on which the future of freedom in America hinges help us protect freedom
Help us restore him call two three five four six. Oh six
Yeah, the war on drugs
Is a way for the powers that be the ruling class the owning class we're going to call them to control the rest of us
To control probably 80% of us that you know don't own everything in the world
You know that those of us that just want to live you know in a society of tolerance and openness
And you know they don't want that because they make their profits off of controlling folks
So give us a call or check out our website

Yeah, so I mean that's just you know ten percent less than ten percent

Have our rights being seen taken away lightly
You know we want to take back control of our own lives
We're not going to give up control of these people that you know want us to you know to submit to obedience training is
Fred Arthur says so
Give us a call and you know because we want to make sure that doctors have the right
to prescribe what they feel is necessary for their patients, and that's a key component of the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act and
It says that right in our ballot question. It says
legalizes marijuana for medical purposes and to adults so
We need your help get involved. There's not much time left
We've got to the end of this month to put this thing on the ballot
So if you know someone who needs a job who needs work
We don't have we don't employ people, but we do contract with petition
Circulators and we pay per signature so call us at this number two three five four six oh six
Yeah, and it's time for us to you know to you know get together and think about you know
You know maybe you're watching the show, and you've never used cannabis in your life
But you probably know somebody who has you know and that person isn't a bad person that person holds down a job
Or you're watching you hold down a job you pay your taxes, and you realize that it's not a big deal
It's not the big fear that the government is is telling us. You know you've got folks out there like Gordon Smith
Senator Gordon Smith hiding behind children
Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Noelle hiding behind children
Saying that oh, we've got to like take away your rights. We can protect children
It's like that's not true if they really want to protect children using that mentality
They would take away alcohol and prescription drugs more people die from you know wrong use of prescription drugs every year
Then all the illegal drugs yeah, I'm buying so I will die from script
Yeah, so they wouldn't give out any prescription drugs with that with that kind of mentality
And I don't know why they're you know it just because they realize they can't win the argument
on logic or reason they have to hide behind children and
And it's sad you know grown men and women hiding behind children. They can't even stay in on their own ideas
Yeah, just last month Paul and I held a news conference to counter Senator Gordon Smith and Sheriff Noel
When they said that we have to stop marijuana in fact Sheriff
No, Lee said I saw him on this news conference that we were we opposed him in the TV thing
He said that if you get a marijuana petition shoved in your face
Don't sign it well Sheriff. No Lee. We don't shove petitions in people's face
I've never shoved anything in anybody's face. I don't like the implication
I don't like you coming and arresting our fellow citizens for marijuana
And we're gonna stop you buddy, so call us and help us stop this crazy Sheriff
Call us at two three five four six oh six yeah
I mean you know we've got to send Sheriff Noel a message, and yeah look you know so you know when it's coming up
You know in the fall. You know he'll be on a ballot. You know write somebody else's name in
There's a guy named slider who's running, and I don't know if he's right or bad, but he's gotta be better than this cloud
Well, no, that's but then you know sliders history though because we're talking about the fall ballot now
Oh, so I mean right you know write somebody in
just so Noel I doesn't you know walk in in a landslide and
You know and we got to send those all those folks a message. You know Vera cats
You know and all the city commissioners. She's not running this year well, but we've got some of the message
Yeah, because she'll be out there. You know hiding behind kids herself. You know and
Because they can't win this they can't win the argument on ideas or reason
It's like slowly the emotion of children, and you know the right message on the children is think for yourself
I mean, that's how you know
Anybody you know who has been brought up in a in a normal way realizes that you know you tell your kids to think for yourself
You know because a parent can't be there behind him 24 hours a day
And so that's what that's what this is all about folks thinking for yourself
Picking up that phone give us a phone call
Getting initiative filling it out with your signature and hope with some other signatures
Sending it back to us, and if you have it already send it back now
We need it the end of June is our deadline
So if you are going to get involved in the petition drive
You better do it now if you're out there, and you know someone who needs to earn money have them call us
We're closing our show now. We want to thank you for watching last reminder if you have petitions send them back
That's right folks and thanks for watching. We'll see you next time. Yeah, it's been another exciting edition of cannabis common-sense
