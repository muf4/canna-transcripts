At the times when I am weakest I shall venture most of all
When I'm lonely, Jody you're less One who answers when I call
I know John John shall protect me Though they're mighty, though I'm small
I shall praise John everlasting More than any, oh girl
Yes, only time's death saved me, bled the order Left me and my sister gone away
And everything I had somebody take it from me
No more could I do and no more could I say No more to win my needs and fear
I woke up this morning I couldn't even see
No one was there to look at me
Oh she was gone, gone, gone So far away
I woke up this morning I couldn't even see
No one was there to look at me
Oh she was gone, gone, gone So far away
Just how long and how far I can't say
But there's one thing I know
Deep down inside, Jah Jah Never leave I alone
At the times when I'm weakest I trust that the Lord
Is the one thing that keeps me on
Yes, only time's death saved me, bled the order Left me and my sister gone away
And everything I had somebody take it from me
No more could I do and no more could I say No more to win my needs and fear
I woke up this morning I couldn't even see
No one was there to look at me
Oh she was gone, gone So far away
At the times when I am weakest I shall thank Jah most of all
See my brother all have left me and my sister gone away
And everything I had somebody take it away
But more could I do and more could I say
No more to win my needs and fear
Put my trust in the Almighty
I know the road rocky and the way very long
I have to chant so many
Now what's your mind?
Just ask me get me inspiration
No one in this world could I mind
But the one in Zion
So what's your mind?
See my brother all have left me and my sister gone away
And everything I had somebody take it away
But more could I do and more could I say
No more to win my needs and fear
See my brother all have left me and my sister gone away
And everything I had somebody take it away
But more could I do and more could I say
I shall thank John most of all when I'm lonely.
Jolly only one who answers when I call.
I know John shall protect me though they're mighty.
Though I'm small, I shall praise John everlasting more than any.
Over all.
