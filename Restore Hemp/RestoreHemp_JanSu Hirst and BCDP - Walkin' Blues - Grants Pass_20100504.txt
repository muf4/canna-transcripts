I want to remind you we're all here for the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act because it is time
to re-legalize cannabis hemp in this country.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
We just had a decision from the Oregon Supreme Court that said all you medical marijuana
patients are second class citizens.
You can be fired just for what medicine you're taking.
Boo hoo.
That sucks.
That's why we need to legalize it.
We will always be treated second class citizens until it's legal for everyone.
He's right you know.
And your job now, you have a job.
Get yourself registered if you're not registered to vote.
And when it comes up I want you to sign the petition and once that petition is signed
and we put it forward and it's enough names and we can get it on the ballot in the fall,
vote this sucker in.
Ladies and gentlemen Jan Sue Hirsh.
The walking blues.
The blues so bad that you just walk and walk and walk.
I have.
I have.

I have.
I have.
I have.
I have.
I have.
I have.
