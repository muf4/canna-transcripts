We need to stop regulating based on THC concentrations.
This is completely arbitrary.
Scientists have shown through their studies
that regulating based on THC is an arbitrary,
especially the 0.3%.
What we should be doing, what I've been advocating for,
is regulating based on cannabinoid profiles,
such as a THC-CBD ratio,
and that would look at the true psychoactivity of the plant
and the symbiotic relationship of all the cannabinoids
and the terpenes within the plant,
so that we can be using this as a whole plant approach
and using each type of cannabis
for the best use that it does have,
not limiting our plant to a 0.3%
when studies have shown that the 0.3%
is limiting the production of seed and oil, et cetera.
So here in Oregon, 2015 was our first production season,
and we had nine farmers cultivating this year.
Harvest started about, yeah.
Woo!
Yeah, it's nine farmers.
It was incredible.
One of our farmers is actually right there, Eric Hempstead.
Thanks so much.
Woo!
We did have some issues with seed importation
this past year.
That's why we only had nine of our farmers planting,
but we're looking forward
to a more successful production season in 2016.
Harvest began about three weeks ago,
and some of our farmers are still harvesting this week
as we're going.
Very cool.
