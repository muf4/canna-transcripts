Our founding fathers imported hemp into the United States originally.
And we're educating the youth who soon won't believe the lie.
It's just a matter of time, and it's time to take a stand.
Because it's a who's and not a why.
What the money can win, been going on for years.
Just keeps right on going.
Like a cold boy with the comics, prohibition at the bite.
You can throw a song in prison, but you cannot win the fight.
Because it's a who's and not a why.
