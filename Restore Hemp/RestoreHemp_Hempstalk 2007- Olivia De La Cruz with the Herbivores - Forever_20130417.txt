I loved you, loved you, loved you
Baby, I was true
And I am a woman
To be with you, you, you
It seems so strong but
We just couldn't hold on
It doesn't have to end badly
Nobody was wrong
The fool who found us
Could never forget me
The baby just wasn't great
When love was supposed to be
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
And I've made it into out of love
And I've taken tonight
None of us has been wrong
None of us is right
Maybe, maybe one day
I'll have won't be lost
But right now, right now, right now
Baby, we just cannot spare the cost
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Now, mm, mm, mm
And I've made it into out of love
And I've taken tonight
None of us has been wrong
None of us is right
Maybe, maybe one day
I'll have won't be lost
But right now, right now, right now
Baby, we just cannot spare the cost

And I've taken tonight
None of us has been wrong
Baby, I'm surprised at the way
That life was supposed to be
But right now, right now, right now

I never would have found this
And forever, it's a mess, it's a me
I can't find you without my need
Baby, this wasn't the way
That love was supposed to be
