Hello and welcome to another exciting edition of Cannabis Common Sense. My
name is Paul Stanford and I'm one of the chief petitioners on the Oregon Cannabis
Tax Act and here with me is my co-host, my fellow chief petitioner, the treasurer
of our political committee, the Campaign for the Restoration and Regulation of
Health and the president of the Oregon Wildlife Federation, Mr. Paul Loney. Well
thanks Paul. I like that introduction and yes we are here to try and get you
to help us out with the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act. As Paul said, this show is part
of our political action committee, the Campaign for the Restoration and
Regulation of Health and he's showing you there one of our wonderful initiatives.
At this time on these show here we got some special treats for you tonight.
We're going to have some interviews up in Vancouver, British Columbia where we
spent a few days up there checking out the sea up in Vancouver. I think we had a
good time up in Vancouver, Paul. We went up there for what, three days was it? Yes, I
had a wonderful time. It was an excellent trip. Up in Vancouver the police
basically ignore the marijuana laws and they don't arrest people for smoking
marijuana. There's several establishments where people openly smoke marijuana and
we visited there and interviewed some of the people. So tonight we'll have Mark
Emery on who is the founder and original proprietor of Hemp BC. Yeah, I think the
viewers out there will really like that. It's quite educational. Mark Emery is
quite an inspiration to everybody I think. He's definitely a unique
individual and he's got his own points of view which are, we may not all agree with all of them,
but he's got a vision and he followed his vision. I really like that fact that
Mark Emery had a vision and he followed it. And it's taken him incredible places
He'll talk, he's been on CNN, featured on a number of CNN things. He's been on the
cover of the Wall Street Journal with his own little picture there and just
tons of places and he was nice enough to let us interview him for a long period
of time and tonight we'll show a portion of that interview. We'll have some more
on subsequent shows as well. Yeah, and we'll have other interviews with other
folks up in Vancouver. Because up there in Vancouver they have the Cannabis Cafe
which sells food made from marijuana products, all vegetarian, a lot of good
vegan dishes. Has the Hemp BC retail store, all sorts of products made from
hemp clothes. And of course it has the smoking utensils, it has books on growing
and it has just books on the plant itself, the history of it. And interviews with
the Cannabis Canada magazine which is one of the best magazines out there
today on the whole hemp issue. And interviews with some people who work for
the magazine and some scenes of Vancouver. Yeah, Vancouver is a lovely city and we
got to go up there and kind of taste the cannabis culture so to speak and we're
happy to take you there and inform you of what's going on in our show. But
before we go to our Bart Gimory interview or at least part one of that, we want to
remind you to give us a call at 235-4606. We're circulating the Oregon
Cannabis Tax Act petition as many of you know. And if you have some of those
petitions I want to urge you to fill in this box on the bottom and mail them
back to us right away. If you're going to get some more signatures do it now, mail
it back to us. We'll mail you some more but let's get those petitions in. What
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act will do is tax and regulate the sales of marijuana
to adults. It will allow adults to cultivate marijuana. It will license
farmers to cultivate the crop for sales. It will also allow medical marijuana and
the industrial cultivation of hemp to produce paper, fabric, protein, oil and
literally 50,000 other products. So I want to urge you to call us at 235-4606.
That's 235-4606. Yes, definitely give us a call and help us out. I mean we want to
change the entire culture here in Oregon that's surrounding hemp. Get rid of the
prohibition culture and go into the much more of a regulation culture. That's like
you know the first step to freedom is to you know get rid of prohibition and you
know we want to just regulate it the same as alcohol is. You know we would
have it for recreational use in state liquor stores and that would be I think
a very good way of doing it because there's only you know adults. They check
IDs and then you wouldn't have people on playgrounds selling marijuana. People
stay on the street corners selling it. It'd just be much more of a pleasant
atmosphere and we would and the state of course would raise money off of that and
I think everybody would have a much better time with it and as you can see
up in Vancouver there's such a wonderful atmosphere up there. There's a
great community and I hope that comes through in the shows that we have
upcoming here, the various interviews, that the people up there just really
know how to respect the plant and then therefore everybody's okay with it. The
police are okay with it. It's against the law there but the police say hey you
know as long as you're not bothering anybody, why should we bother you? Right. And that's the way
it should be. So the first part of this interview is with Mark Emery. We want to
urge you to call us and get these petitions though at 235-4606. Now once
again Mark Emery does say a few radical things. I don't know if we'll get into it
this portion but of course he has his own views and he's really done a lot to
change the perceptions and misperceptions regarding marijuana with
some facts. So let's without further ado let's go to the Mark Emery interview.
Here we are in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada interviewing
the most famous marijuana smoker in the world. The latest, this is Mark Emery.
Thanks for having us. How are you Paul? I'm glad to be here. Thanks for having us.
You originally were in Ontario. Oh yeah. You were an activist there? Oh yeah.
Since 1980 I've been an activist. You know I was greatly inspired by Ayn Rand
in the book Atlas Shrugged and the Fountainhead in 1979 and become a real
activist ever since and issues of human freedom and liberty and nothing more
pressing than marijuana legalization in that front. But for the first 12 years
from 1980 to 1992 I went to court and jail for many different things. Opening
my stores on Sunday which we were convicted of and sent to jail. We used to
sell everything that the government banned so we went to court and were
convicted there and I during a municipal garbage strike in 1986 I
provided my own private garbage service for free for the public picked up 72
thousand pounds of garbage just to basically show people they shouldn't be
helpless during you know government strikes. I mean I've done all sorts of
stuff but prior to the marijuana legalization issue which I really
started in earnest in around 1991. In 91 was that when you moved here? Was that
back in Ontario? No that was in Ontario. We started selling illegal banned books on
marijuana. I was shocked to find they were illegal but I always wondered why
High Times was never on the newsstands in Canada and why you couldn't buy any
kind of material about marijuana and it's because Canada has a law that
basically says anything that promotes advocates or in any way condones
marijuana use is illegal and subject to a hundred thousand dollar fine and
that's on video or in printed. It specifically points ask for marijuana? No
it says any illegal drugs. So you can't promote any illegal drug if marijuana is
illegal of course and that's the primary one I mean there's not a lot of people
promoting LSD or heroin although there certainly is a lot of medical
documentation that would also be illegal in those areas too and of course all
books about the subject are illegal etc etc and there are no exemptions and it
provides for a hundred thousand dollar fine and there were six months in jail
and that's not a first offense. A second offense is three hundred thousand dollars. So
anyway there isn't any fine bigger than the criminal code as it turns out and
that's all for books about marijuana. So anyway we started selling them but I
didn't get charged for that. That was clearly unconstitutional so we
ended up selling them in front of the police station one day after a big press
conference and hundreds of people there and they still wouldn't arrest me. So
that was my history in Ontario and then I went to Asia to live for a couple years
came back here in March of 94 and founded Hemp BC on April 11th 1994 and
then we really kicked up some dust. So what is or at that time what was
Hemp BC because a lot of us don't know what Hemp BC was at that time. Well actually when I came here there were no hemp
stores there are no pipes or bongs all that's illegal there were no books
about marijuana and High Times magazine was illegal in all of Canada and not
distributed here for four or five years by that time and there was nothing and
so I knew there must be a market there somewhere and what I did is from April
11th through July of that year I sold High Times magazine and growing on
my own door-to-door to houses to people at bus stops to variety stores. I sort of
was a mini distributor to about 40 50 stores who were willing to handle it but
by the way four-fifths of all people approached in stores refused to handle
High Times because it was banned they said and so you know human freedom and
liberty is not alive in the minds of most booksellers but we did find some
who'd sell it like here and there five ten twenty copies and stuff like that
and that's what I did for three months sold things door-to-door and then
earning enough money to start the to pay the rent on the location at 324 West
Hastings which became the original Hemp BC and where we were first rated. Mark can I stop you here just for a second where did you get the Hemp Times or the High Times from?
Oh we would just import them they didn't stop them at customs. Oh they didn't stop them at customs. No no that law was not being enforced but the fear
factor involved and having a law like that meaning you could be charged at any
time meant that distributors wouldn't conventional distributors simply wouldn't
handle it because the the climate was also different in the 1980s in the Reagan
Bush period you know people were easily scared off but that started to thaw
considerably especially with the influence of the Emperor wears no clothes
in the late 80s and early 90s and eventually we did open on July 7th 1994
the Hemp BC store which is now the Hemp BC Legal Assistance Center that
location. I understand that block was all boarded up when you came to it and that
oh it's a bad location. Yeah the exact location of where Hemp BC was founded used to be a
communist Albanian bookshop and it had been put out of business when somebody
torched it so the place was all fired and charred inside and there was urine
smells and urine all it just was a filthy block and that was one of the
filthiest buildings and but it was run by a guy who would be it was anxious to
have anybody renovate the place and fix it up and that's how we got in and a
seemingly controversial business we had an Asian landlord and all my landlords
are Asian for this building all our stores because they tend to only care if
they get the rent they don't really care about what you're doing in that building
and we really do renovate all the buildings extensively all the properties
we've ever been in have been improved considerably so they benefited by that
trust in us and from there though we launched a separate growth shop down the
street right after the first raid in January 96 we opened a little
growth shop three weeks later just next door and then we consolidated those
into the Hemp BC superstore that you see now so what was the initial reaction of
the authorities when you open up the first Hemp BC store? We never got any
reaction I've never yet had a complaint sent to me by letter form or written
form from City Hall from anybody in fact I've never had a complaint from the
general public either and I used to work there six days a week and I've never had
a single person say I don't agree with what you're doing I've never had it it's
the least controversial enterprise I've ever started that's great to hear yeah
well you got to understand that Vancouver and British Columbia are very much a live
and let live society the problem is they don't get politicians that reflect that
and that's typical because live and let live people don't tend to go vote
people who tend to vote tend to be people with property vested interests
you know people from Vancouver's West Side who have a lot of wealthy property
and they don't want anything to change and they don't want to keep it white
Caucasian and you know that old Vancouver people who want the new
Vancouver are the immigrants the new people here there are movers and shakers
young people people who don't conventionally see any purpose to voting
and to a large degree they're correct there is no real purpose to voting but
the problem is we're victimized by the electoral process in the absence of that
so that's a problem well what do you see the future here in Vancouver the city
and the province BC about democracy then if this many people are flouting the law
and you know and they won't change the laws I mean is that gonna have any sort
of impact on democracy here you think well ultimately you know politicians are
like a flock of seagulls they follow the leader and the leader is public opinion
and public opinion if it lingers long enough in the one direction will
eventually permeate society completely and all people will presume that that is
the proper way of thinking so things gonna happen in a very gradual way
without any like momentous decisions on behalf of Parliament or some some old
judge you know he's not going to deliver liberty to us because you know we think
we're do judges are very frightened old men really who've been insulated behind
a court bench for a lot of their lives and don't really understand the real
world they're not used to shaking things up in any proper controversial
way especially Canadian judge Canadian judges are particularly conservative
they like to think they've got a heart of gold and sometimes they do have a
compassionate heart but they're not they're not the kind of people that are
courageous enough to change laws and you're not gonna find politicians I mean
you have three million pot smokers in the country about 15% of the adult
population perhaps even more I mean you have clearly no one in favor of
prohibition in Canada any longer but nonetheless you don't have a single
advocate for marijuana legalization in Parliament I mean not one single guy has
taken on the issue of civil liberties for marijuana smokers even though you'll
find people in Parliament having the same interest in homosexuals of whom
there are far fewer in Canada and you'll see the same people having the same
interest in First Nations or Chinese or Asian people's rights and all of those
are legitimate but there's far fewer of each one of those groups in Canada than
there are marijuana smokers and for some reason we have been considered suitable
scapegoats like they have in America for 60 years and there's no explanation ever
offered like in Parliament they never give an explanation so why we're keeping
prohibition nobody says yes we need to criminalize a million Canadians and you
know arrest a hundred thousand every year and for what purpose and you never
get that answer you never get part two of the opening premise like okay if
we're having this police state what's the explanation well we don't have one
you know and so it goes like that and that's most incomprehensible well but
isn't it great what's going on up there Paul in Vancouver British Columbia oh
it's just fascinating what's going on up there and you know we can do better here
by getting our petition and getting signatures get on a ballot this November
and then come January 1 we could have cannabis cafes here in Portland all over
Oregon right and we need your help to do that we've been doing these shows for a
year now if you have called us previously and got our petitions please
send them right in if you're not sure where to send them to are you want more
petitions call us right away at 235-4606 in some cases we are actually
paying petitioners so if you'd like to help us give us a call at 235-4606 if
you have access to the internet look at our web page at HTTP colon slash slash
www.crrh.org you can actually print our petitions online so we want you to turn
your petitions in though right correct turn them in so we can get a count out
there as soon as possible because we know it is everybody kind of hangs on to
them and sort of forgets about them but if only have two or three signatures on
there send them in because they all count you know we've sent thousands of
those out there we've just got a tiny fraction of them in so we urge you to
send your petitions back in we have to have them by the end of June so if you
have petitions send them back and if you need more give us a call at 503-235-4606
if you're in the Portland area that's 235-4606 so I guess we should get back
to that Mark Emery interview you know it's just fascinating yeah it is it's
good to know that early history of how hemp BC started and how the whole
culture there started in community so I think it's going to be great watching
the rest of the interview and think about how we here in Oregon can do the
same thing with all of our help so here it is the Mark Emery hemp BC interview
thanks for watching as long as we're moving towards freedom then you're
moving in a positive direction and certainly since the time I've been in
here things have moved on the marijuana issue in a very positive direction I
mean you know when you consider you couldn't buy a pipe in this town you
know and you couldn't buy a book or magazine about marijuana and you know I
mean productivity is probably tripled since I've you know been here in the
last four years and we've been on every major media that which was unthinkable
before they would never think about putting a marijuana seed dealer on the
front page of the Wall Street Journal and you know CNN the mass media the Ted
Turner you know Time Warner corporate establishment give me a great review on
CNN or for that matter Rolling Stone the old the old hippies and the new
capitalists and Rolling Stone to give us an excellent review to we always get
good reviews there's a daily paper you've got article from two days ago
another great full-page article they're always great reviews the media is
completely on side in a lot of issues when they interview me it comes out fine
I always ask them whenever you do a grow bust you know you always take these
cops press releases and say you know for hydroponic operations or seeds why don't
you ask them what their moral justification for that is if resources
are short how can you justify chasing down any marijuana growers when we know
it's harmless when everybody in British Columbia proves it when two-thirds have
clearly gone on record saying they don't think marijuana should be illegal why do
you waste anybody's time why do you destroy people's lives why do you
violate their civil rights why do you continue this police state for nothing
they never ask that question they can't get up the nerve to ask the cops that
question but if every every journalist asked the cop that question every time
there was a girl raid you'd see them drop they just wouldn't want to get
grilled anymore and then people who were raided would call the press to alert
them and the relationship would be reversed they'd call them say I've just
been violated in these people would record their point of view instead it's
repeatedly always the police point of view yeah they just print the police
news bolt and yeah now they're a little more inquiring inquisitive here because
they know that the most the population is not supportive of this marijuana war
the police are waging but you know the media could do a lot more to accelerate
the liberation of several million people and most of the reporters are on site
it's again the older editorial staff the people who have more corporate interest
in mind will like to tread a fine line between supporting the police as
everybody has to knee-jerk do so in a corporate you know democracy like we
have here we have to say you know the police may have done something wrong it's
not like we're against the police for anything yeah blah blah blah even though
they know they've been like ruining lives and families in this unnecessary
drug war for their own self-interest you know for the last two decades I mean
they sure politicians inspire them but cops can tell them to fuck off really we
got better things to do and no one would say boo about marijuana but cops do it
because a lot of people thousands of Canadians for example 2,000 cops are
employed every eight hour shift it just tastes down marijuana so if they made
marijuana illegal tomorrow you got 6,000 guys right there who were immediately
superfluous and probably 10 or 20,000 other cops I mean if you didn't have a
drug war at all you would need half the police officers in North America that
you've got today oh yeah absolutely because you know the
prisons yeah exactly I mean exactly fraction of prisons and you'd have a
great increase in society safety yeah so the prohibition accomplishes the exact
opposite of every state of Dane it raises the price of marijuana or drugs
or all drugs so that you and I the consumer have to spend more of that on
our supplies as opposed to our children or education or buying a new computer or
a home or investing in the economy or starting your own business a lot of our
money goes to the herbs and drugs we seek it encourages police corruption
armed crime gangs it destabilizes at least 15 to 20 foreign governments in
the world right now whole countries are in total destabilization because of a
US drug war in South and Central America you've got whole aid programs geared on
whether they have a crop eradication program going on in that particular
community like India or Bangladesh you've got you know organized crime
profiting because it's illegal you've got biker gangs you've got you've got
police corruption you've got people being shot dead in their homes during
raids you've got every kind of civil liberty disobedience from urine testing
to kids ratting on you at school to parents riding on their kids I mean it's
a whole terrible system we fostered with this drug war and not a good thing is
covered it's destroyed everything that's supposedly held dear in America freedom
privacy liberty money law and order the clean government and prohibition ruins
it all well I mean I think the one is that one way yeah one that we really
lost America I don't know how you guys are going here but it all right to you
be free from search and seizure in America I mean when I was a kid growing
up that was the you know I was held up to be one of our greatest yeah we don't
know there's no privacy or you know cops do what they want you know the thing is
they tend to be politer about it's friendly fashion you know in a sense but
but then you know I should talk so on one hand if I run United States I'd be
in jail for the next 20 years so right you know so you know I've got 17 counts
the guy's been doing nine trafficking and I'm still walking I don't know how
long that'll last but you know I'm still out on the street even if they
barred me from my own businesses and for it forced me at gunpoint to sell them
the fact is all of it still basically exists except I'm not allowed to own it
you've got to be flexible you can't go on that block yeah you can't go that
well these are revolutionary times and for a revolution you still be allowed on
the street not shot dead maybe I should be grateful yeah yeah so what kind of
legal charges are you facing well we've got eight counts of trafficking from two
different times the most recently the one that got me barred from my own
stores allegedly and this usually I get charged by the way after I do a major
national interview of some kind or we get raided or something like that and I
was on the Vicki Gaborow show live for 25 minutes nationwide and then the next
the later on the day I got served with I was put in jail and tried for two
counts of trafficking marijuana and hashish and apparently two months
earlier some Americans had come up to my cafe a man and his three daughters and I
allegedly got them high allegedly gave them a gift of five dollars worth of
hash which would be about that much I guess half a gram a quarter of a gram
and they went back to the United States and they got caught with it and they
said Mark Emory gave it to us and they were let go and I don't really recall
this oh god no I mean it could well just be a story they sell market oh yeah
well I find it fantastic that it's even you can use that I mean that way what
about the guy who's caught with a big truck full of pot he can just say mark
Emory told me to deliver this but anyway so they sent this back to Vancouver and
they keep sat on it for six seven weeks then all sudden right after that
interview they tried to move to counts of trafficking there's no witness
because they're not coming back here to testify there's no hash no cop ever
saw it and not and the only person who took a statement is an American
immigration officer so it's not even within the legal jurisdiction of Canada
that anything is alleged to have happened with anybody but the thing is
they charged me and we don't come to trial till next December so for the
whole year so anyway they put me in jail so that's what yeah that's what led to
you not being able to visit yes they put me in jail and they said listen if you
don't agree to never go back to the 300 block you have to sign this agreement
undertaking and and the failure to obey it is indefinite imprisonment right then
we're not letting you out we're gonna ask him to hold you because you've
already got tons of trafficking charges and you know and so I had to agree with
her they would never let me out for months and months so now if I'm going
the block where my old shops are then I would go to jail indefinitely until it
comes up to trial in December isn't that great what's going on up there in
Vancouver once again I'll have to say it's fabulous I mean it's just so
interesting you know Mark Embry such a great person yeah he's fascinating how
he stood up for all of our rights up there and pioneering things with direct
civil disobedience yeah exactly I mean from what he started off with just like
selling banned books and banned magazines to saying okay we're gonna
sell you know smoking utensils and to a multi-million dollar enterprise with 43
employees he just pulled himself up by his bootstraps basically going door-to-
door selling magazines and using that to open his businesses yeah I mean that's
kind of interesting going from shop to shop so okay here you know you want to
take a couple copies of a banned magazine that can get you busted you know and it's just it was quite
impressive how he did it like I say I mean the man he had a vision and he
followed it and he got there and I think you know we here have a vision in Oregon
right and that is to completely legalize and regulate adult sales of marijuana to
allow people to grow their own to license farmers to grow the crop
commercially to allow medical patients to access marijuana through pharmacies
with the doctor's prescription and to allow farmers without a license to
cultivate industrial hemp to produce thousands of different products and we
can do that here in Oregon with your help
that's right call us 503-235-4606 and give us a call today
and you know help us put into reality our vision you know Mark Emery had his
vision up there in Vancouver for all British Columbia and for eventually all of
Canada and he wants to have it for all of North America I mean he's quoted in a Rolling
Stone interview the one that has a Buffy the Vampire Slayer on a cover if folks
want to go and look at it great interview with Mark in there and he's
saying that you know he wants to spread his vision elsewhere and he doesn't mind
who else copies it right in fact he said that it was picked up in the Portland
magazine the Willamette Week that Portland is going to be one of the next
places to follow that example so we want to go farther than that we want to
regulate the market and just end prohibition here and now so help us with
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act call us at 235-4606 if you have our petitions send
them back in now we'll send you out some more but we have to have all of our
signatures by the end of June don't delay send them back today or call us
right now and we'll send you the petitions in a week so call us right
away yeah you know give us a call you know and talk to us if you're feeling
alone out there that you know there's nobody else out there like that that's
going to like you that likes to see it regulated likes to see patients be able
to get this with with a doctor's prescription for wherever the doctor
thinks it should be needed for you know call us and talk to folks who are just
like you who want to see this regulated who want to see an end to prohibition
want to see an end to crime want to see an end to the war on some drugs who want
to see a beginning of freedom to bring back our liberties to bring back the the
fun that marijuana can can give you any kind of recreational pursuit and to stop
this incredible buildup of prisons and the prison industrial complex in the
United States if you want to help restore freedom in America help us with
the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act by calling us at 235-4606 yeah definitely give us a
call and like I say I mean I just you know it's to ban a plant that is just so
ludicrous to me I mean something that grows it shouldn't be banned I mean it's
just like who you know we think we're more powerful than nature that we're
more powerful than a plant you know it's just like a plant grows naturally I mean
it's just like this is a downfall of our society when we try to ban things that
are natural so call us at 235-4606 and in closing I would like to tell you that
