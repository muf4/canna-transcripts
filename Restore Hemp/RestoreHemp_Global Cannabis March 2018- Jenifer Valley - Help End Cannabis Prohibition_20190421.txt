Hi, my name is Jennifer Valley. They call me Stony Girl.
And I want you all to know that I ran for county commissioner two years ago and I had an amazing
time. I spent 50 bucks so that I could run against my county commissioners because
they tried to ban cannabis in Clackamas County. So I made them talk about cannabis at every single
candidate forum, every single candidate event, and at the end I won 10% of the vote, which was
more than two of the other candidates up there. And here's the big difference. I only spent 350
bucks. I paid 50 bucks for my filing fee and $300 for my candidate statement and that was it.
And the rest of them spent a quarter of a million dollars. Now if I can do that, you can do it too.
And the important thing is all of our legislatures need to hear from us. We need to be running at
every level. State representative, senator, city council, county commissioner, because it's an
opportunity for us to make our voice heard in places where our story would never be told
anywhere else. I got to meet people at the old folks home and tell them about how cannabis oil
cured my stage four cancer. I got to put it in my voters pamphlet and send the message out to
every voter in my county. And I would like everyone to consider running for office at least once.
Don't even worry about whether you win or not. Just know that running to argue is so much fun.
Anyway, thank you all. Have a great day. We need to make it possible for
marijuana to be legal everywhere else.
