Giant steps are what we take
Walking on the moon Oh I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon We could walk together
Walking on the moon We could walk forever
Walking on, walking on that moon
Walking back from your old house Walking on the moon
Walking back from your old house Walking on the moon
Step my feet on, hardly touch the ground Walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound Walking on, walking on that moon
Oh I said some best say I'm wishing my days away
No way, which it is the price your eye will pay
No way, tomorrow is another day No way, my days will pay
My days will pay
Giant steps are what we take Walking on the moon
Oh I hope my legs don't break Walking on the moon
We could walk together Walking on the moon
We could walk forever Walking on, walking on that moon
Oh I said some best say I'm wishing my days away
No way, which it is the price your eye will pay
No way, tomorrow is another day No way, my days will pay
My days will pay
Giant steps are what we take Walking on the moon
Oh I hope my legs don't break Walking on, walking on that moon
