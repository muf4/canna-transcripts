In the 90s, we were making hemp oil in Ohio with Chinese seeds.
And it got pretty popular.
And then we started taking the seed cake, the waste product, and making hempenale out of it.
And that got so popular that we were producing oil 24-7 around the clock.
And I ended up with 6,000 extra barrels, 6,000 extra gallons of oil.
Because we were making it for the seed cake at that point.
So that became the oil that powered the hemp car coming out here 10 years ago.
If you recall at HempFest, we had one of the first biodiesel-powered cars was here running on hemp fuel.
We powered Woody Harrelson's bus down the West Coast in the Further movie,
starting here in Seattle and going down the coast, most of them riding the bicycles, but with the bus following them up.
And so we proved a long time ago that we can do this.
We ran the generators here on biodiesel one year, hemp biodiesel.
It can be done. It's extremely convertible.
But yeah, that's right. There's a lot more energy in the hemp plant than just the oil.
And there's actually a man here named Aguadas. He's here at HempFest. I saw him last night.
And he's got a patent for pyrolytization in a new way that is very promising
for turning much more of the hemp plant into an energy source.
I kind of discourage hemp for energy because it's so expensive.
Why would you take $40 a gallon oil and burn it up in your car?
But pyrolytization gives us the opportunity to actually create fuel economically.
And it's coming.
