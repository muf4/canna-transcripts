I'm from Washington State. I know we're in Oregon right now, but some people from Vancouver might be visiting today
If you know anybody in Washington tell them we did legalize recreational
But the lawmakers in Washington think that means that we no longer need to be allowed to grow 15 plants
I think that's ridiculous. The lawmakers are acting like children
I'm ashamed to be a Washingtonian now that this law is on the books
The fact that our governor signed this law onto the books makes me ashamed to be a Washingtonian so look for
R-76 this will undo what the governor just did and it will maintain
Medical marijuana in Washington State the way it is it will let us keep growing 15 plants
It will allow the farmers markets to keep happening and providing the highest quality most affordable medicine to patients who need it
Tell your friends about real legalization in Washington State we need volunteers to help with the r-76
referendum, thank you
