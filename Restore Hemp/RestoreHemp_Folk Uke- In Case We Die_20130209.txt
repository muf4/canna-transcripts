Of all the world, dear, you are the one My favorite human under the sun
What brings tomorrow, we never know So you'd better kiss me before you go
There are the flowers, there are the trees There's you and me, dear, among all these
Sooner or later, there is goodbye So kiss me once more, dear, in case we die
Death could be waiting outside of this room Anticipating yours and my potential doom
We could be walking, trip on our own feet Not even to mention all the psychos we meet
Sooner or later, there is goodbye So kiss me once more, dear, in case we die
Oh no, I can't, I'm just strumming
I thought you could take it out of key
Death could be waiting outside of this room Anticipating yours and my potential doom
We could be walking, trip on our own feet Not even to mention all the psychos we meet
Sooner or later, there is goodbye So kiss me once more, dear, in case we die
Kiss me once more, dear, in case we die
