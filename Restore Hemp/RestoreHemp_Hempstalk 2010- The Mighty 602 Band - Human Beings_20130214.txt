Whatever happened to the compassion?
This is my question, just what I'm asking.

Human beings.
Whatever happened to the good old days?

Bring back the old ways.
Still human beings will plant the seeds
of evil thoughts and evil deeds.
These human beings, well, they don't know.
Human beings, well, they don't know.
Human beings have planted seeds.
Human beings have so much greed.
Human beings have planted seeds.
Human beings have so much greed.
