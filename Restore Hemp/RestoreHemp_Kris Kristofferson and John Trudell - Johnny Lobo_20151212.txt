Once upon a dusty reservation, somewhere in the land of city hall.
Johnny Goldborn played with fire and dreamed of open spaces.
Locked inside the heaven, gone to hell.
All the dreams were gone but not forgotten.
And his name murdered like a holy buffalo.
Johnny Goldborn filled the rules and grew into a warrior.
He fought for his people and his soul.
Loaded God with lessons that he carried.
Fall from Vietnam to Wu-Min-D.
Johnny Lobo burned a flag he knew had been dishonored.
Paid the price for thinking he was free.
Someone set his house on fire.
Burned it to the ground.
With his wife and children locked inside.
Later when the bitter tears were falling to the ashes.
Something good Johnny Lobo died.
Oh, Johnny Lobo.
Oh, Johnny Lobo.
In the darkened corner of a town.
Burning down old memories.
Johnny Lobo stares into the smoke and dreams of clouds.
Running like wild horses in the wind.
Holy phoenix rising from the ashes.
Into the circle of the sun.
Johnny Lobo's warrior heart was burnished in the embers.
The burn was just begun.
Oh, Johnny Lobo.
Oh, Johnny Lobo.
Thank you!
