I wondered why you're here, but now I know
Shit, makes the flowers grow
Oh shit, makes the flowers grow
I wondered why you're here, but now I know
Shit, makes the flowers grow
I'm a dainty little flower, alone in the snow
And you've got the power to fertilize my soul
Shit, makes the flowers grow
Oh shit, makes the flowers grow
I wondered why you're here, but now I know
Shit, makes the flowers grow
You nourish my body, and the sun warms my bones
I know karate, I should, I studied it for eight years
Shit, makes the flowers grow
Everybody
Oh shit, makes the flowers grow
I wondered why you're here, but now I know
Shit, makes the flowers grow
Oh shit, makes the flowers grow
Thank you
