Howdy folks, thanks for coming out. We couldn't have had better weather
But you know as has been mentioned several times we said in measure 91 that it would not affect
medical marijuana three times and
in
The history of the legislature they have never taken a law passed by the people and changed it before
This is the only time the legislature has to date
Said oh the people didn't actually mean what we passed
You know and not only did they change the law they declared an emergency a legislative emergency
So we couldn't referendum on the changes that were made
Because it was a legislative emergency. Well, that's wrong
The people of the state support this program, you know marijuana should be cheap and plentiful it grows on trees
You know it it is
Everything that's been said about it as a lie as many of you probably heard me say ad nauseum
It's the oldest crop cultivated over
12,000 years maybe over 25,000 years and it's the most productive crop
It produces more fuel more fiber more food and more medicine than any other plant
We have co-evolved with cannabis the whole deal to prohibit
Has always been about money and power and the centralization of economic and political control
and the petrochemical
pharmaceutical military industrial transnational corporate elite
Fascist sons of bitches don't want us to have cannabis and that's what it's all about folks
And so the sooner we can in these stupid
Overregulations and free cannabis so our farmers can grow it without regard to its THC content
But according to the varieties that make the best and most fuel fiber food and medicine
Then the whole economy of this world will change
Instead of seeing the centralization of economic control will see the decentralization
cannabis regulations are
overly specific it should be
Allowed to be cultivated with less regulation, you know, this is an alcohol
No one dies from this the way they die from alcohol
And so we need realistic regulations and the way to do that is to educate our lawmakers
they think you know a lot of them believe the
The lies that we've been told all our lives by these
Economic forces to benefit the few it's our job to educate these folks
That this is the oldest crop the most productive crop and it can change the whole world
If they'll allow it to do so the sooner the better Oregon can be on the cutting edge of exciting new
economic and ecological change
If our legislature will get out of the way
So please get in there tell your legislators. Are there offices that?
Cannabis doesn't deserve to be regulated like alcohol because it's a lot safer
Thank you for coming
It's my honor to be here
and restore him
