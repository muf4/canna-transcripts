The Godfather of Hemp Movement who really began this movement I guess in the early 70s
It's taught us all
Jack died this last year
and I was lucky enough to be able to do his eulogy or be one of the people at his eulogy and
I made it my mind when I knew I was gonna come out here
I wanted to dedicate my travel and my appearance on this show
To my good friend Jack Kerr and I wrote a eulogy about him
For those of you do not know Jack Kerr wrote the Emperor wears no clothes
This is the way I remember Jack Kerr. Jack Kerr is a social and philosophical
Tsunami the ripples from whose splash will forever grace the shores of human consciousness in every freedom-loving nation
He is a grand champion of we the people and the natural cycle in our battle with the synthetic subversion
Which threatens the very concept of the sovereignty of each human individual?
Jack's tireless efforts to eliminate the facts about cannabis have furnished freedom fighters everywhere with the tools of knowledge
With which to resist the fascism of the corporate state as it seeks to subject everyone to its economic bottom line
Jack recognized that cannabis is indeed a gateway to existentialism
Which enlightens our existence and is the basis of our freedom of choice?
He also recognized the miraculous powers of this herb for healing and many sick and dying people have found comfort in its use
After reading his wonderful manifesto. The Emperor wears no clothes. I am one of them
Jack Ayers grand spirit may have left his worn-out body
But he has entered into the hearts and minds of millions of us who will be forever grateful
To have been educated by his commitment to the truth. God bless you Jack
