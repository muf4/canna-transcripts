Roll me a spliff, yes I'd love to have a whiff.
Twist me up a bud, so I can rub your seat tub.
Crank us up a dupe, we'll be rockin' in the groove.
You're just rolling.
Time to get yourself up on this one-way plane
and let your heart do the playing.
Yes, I'd love to check and whiff.
Whisk me up a bud, so I can rub your seat tub.
Crank me up a dupe in the deep, deep groove.
You're just rolling.
Time to get yourself up on this one-way plane
and let your heart do the playing.
I mean we're speaking for this feeling, so
what the, what the, anyway.
Roll us a spliff, yes we'd love to check and whiff.
Whisk me up a bud, so crank us up a dupe.
We'll be rockin' in the deep, deep groove.
And you're just rolling.
