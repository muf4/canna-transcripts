I don't know where our numbers stand in all of this initiative drive, but it's kind of
up to each one of us to get out on the street here and at least, you know, get the people
around us energized, you know, and get some petitions signed.
Because it's that time, and we've got to get it done.
So here's a song for all the people who love marijuana.
Yes, I'd love you to take me with you.
Whisk me up a butt, so I can rub your seat up.
Crank us up a doob, we'll be rockin' in the DD groove if you just roll.
Time to get yourself up on yourself, I get all this feelin' so, what now, what now, anyway.
So let's just flip, yes we'd love to take a whisk.
Whisk me up a butt, so I can rub your seat up.
Crank us up a doob, we'll be rockin' in the DD groove if you just roll.
Let's just flip.
Time to get yourself up on this here one way lane, and let your feet do the pay.
I mean we're speaking for this feelin' so, what now, what now, anyway.
Roll us a spliff, yes I'd love to check your lips.
Twist me up a butt, so I can rub your seat up.
Crank me up a doob, we'll be rockin' in the mood.
Just roll it.
