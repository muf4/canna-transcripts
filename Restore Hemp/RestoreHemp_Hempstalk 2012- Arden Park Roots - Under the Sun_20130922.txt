When we got nowhere to go We can light a fire under the sun
We can blast the radio when we got nowhere to go
We can put the car across control We can blast the radio when we got nowhere
to go Cause girl I've come a long long way for you
And you can make the plan tell me what you wanna do
And out of everyone you're the one I'll be singing to
Cause girl I've come a long long way for you
When the time comes I'll be on the run All the time I gotta move on to the next one
And when you call me back I don't know In the meantime I'll be doing fine
We can last us really on the second prime And even lose the hardest part about the road
We can spend the night under the moon Forget about the real life and enjoy the view
I get lost in time when I lie down next to you
We can rock the whole night away nothing I would rather do
I realize normally we would take it slow That the destination would just be the globe
We can keep high baby girl if you're feeling low
I can promise you tonight you're the only girl I know
When the time comes I'll be on the run All the time I gotta move on to the next one
And when you call me back I don't know In the meantime I'll be doing fine
We can last us really on the second prime And even lose the hardest part about the road
We can light a fire under the sun We can blast the stereo when we got nowhere to go
We can put the car we could control
We can blast the stereo when we got nowhere to go
When the time comes I'll be on the run All the time I gotta move on to the next one
And when you call me back I don't know
In the meantime I'll be doing fine We can last us really on the second prime
And even lose the hardest part about the road
We can light a fire under the sun
Cause girl I've come a long long way for you
