I want to tell y'all a little bit about a plant I know that can save the world
It grows long and tall and has flowers that can make your mind swirl
It's a funky plant with a fiber that is resistant to rain and mold
It's the strongest plant fiber known to man, the best rope you'll ever hold
Well the pioneers covered up the wagon trains with a canvas made of hemp
In Washington and Jefferson they glued on their phones and said they'd make the most of it
The first stars and stripes were sewn on hemp, the first constitution too
Issues around the world for food, fiber, oil, medicine, and fuel
And if we're breaking seeds we won't have no need for any other oil
We can make paints and inks or run our cars going back to next week
We can fix the soil, the mud, the trees, the sea
We can put in our mouth with omega-6 and 3
We can feed the world with the tree of life and live sustainably
But if we cut down all the trees we won't have nowhere to breathe
We'll grow fields of hemp instead, we can make our paper build a house from it
We gotta spread, grow, wild, and free, living the way that we ought to be
Gonna leave my children a better world than my ancestors left me
Whoa, whoa
La la la la la la la la la la la
Whoa, whoa
The female hemp plant makes the best medicines on earth
Helps cancer and AIDS patients eat their food
Helps those with depression overcome the blues
Glaucoma, epilepsy, nausea, insomnia, stress, neurosis, psychosis, pink PMS
All the studies have been done and all the doctors agree
But they can't make money off this plant you see
Cause it's free, it grows from a seed, a wild and free life we ought to be
You know the future is grown in our own backyards
But if we cut down all the trees we won't have nowhere to breathe
We'll grow fields of hemp instead, we can make our paper build a house from it
We gotta spread, grow, wild, and free, living the way that we ought to be
Gonna leave my children a better world than my ancestors left me
Whoa, whoa
So in this modern day and age when we seem to lack spirituality
This one single plant can bring us back ten thousand years in history
To the Shiva, Puranas, the Jesus, the Christ, to the Buddha, the Megas, the Goddess, the light
You can be with all the animals, be one with all the trees
But realize the goddess you can see inside me
As the earth is among us we gotta take care of the earth
The earth is the mother that gives life birth
And we can heal all our sins with a single green plant we can start right now
But if we cut down all the trees we won't have nowhere to breathe
We'll grow fields of hemp instead, we can make our paper build a house from it
We gotta spread, grow, wild, and free, living the way that we ought to be
Gonna leave my children a better world than my ancestors left me
Whoa
Whoa
