So, when I was running for office, I was asked what my position was on the legalization of
marijuana.
And what I said was that if every elected official who ever smoked marijuana voted to
legalize it, it would be legal in an instant.
So, it's the truth.
It's the truth.
Here's what we know.
Prohibition has not worked.
It's fueled criminal violence.
Right now in this city, right now in this city, I know this, I know this.
Right now in this city, we have seen murders because people are murdering each other over
pot.
We have seen home invasion robberies because it's a black market substance.
I have a member of my staff, I have a member of my staff, and like a lot of people, he
brews his own beer in his house.
He doesn't have to worry about somebody breaking into his house to steal his beer.
He doesn't have to worry that when he gives it to a friend, he's subjecting himself to
arrest.
And the rules we have right now on marijuana, they put too many young people at risk, not
just of arrest, not just of incarceration, and by the way, which falls much more heavily,
much more heavily on our communities of color than it does on everyone else.
But it also fuels criminal violence and it makes us all less safe.
It's time to stop.
It's time to tax it, regulate it, legalize it.
Vote yes on I-502 and let's have a sane pot policy, marijuana policy for this state of
Washington.
Thank you to Hempfest for 20 years of organizing to change attitudes and this fall, you're
going to do it.
Thank you.
