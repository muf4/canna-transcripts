War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, till then you're bound to burn.
War's over, and they should caught up in a lie, that same old lie.
War's over, so hey let's all get high.
Think in their head, so many give, yet so many more them take.
War's over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, till then you're bound to burn.
War's over, unless you caught up in a lie, the drug war's over.
So hey let's get together and get high.
So what about it, ain't you heard the story yet?
You're going to help change it to add to the debt.
I'm way deep concerned now it ain't no lie.
We all come together soon or we all bounded.
War's over, don't you be acting dumb.
War's over, cause there ain't no where to run.
War's over, unless we caught up in a lie, that same old dirty lie.
War's over, so let's all party together and get high.
