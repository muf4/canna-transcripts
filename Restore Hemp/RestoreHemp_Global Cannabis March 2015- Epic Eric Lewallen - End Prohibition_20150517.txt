How y'all doing out there Portland, Oregon?
So let me start off by telling you a little bit about myself. I have muscular dystrophy.
I was diagnosed at the age of three in my first electric chair by the age of five.
I was known as a pothead. People never understood that I needed certain things to make my days go.
Well when I
learned that I wasn't a pothead, I was a medicator. I was free from the world.
So, you know, we have women, children, men out there that are dying because they cannot get this plant.
They cannot have free access to the meds they need. They are not able to get themselves out of bed.
They are not able to maintain a family life because the government says we are wrong.
You all feel we are wrong? I don't. I think we all deserve the right to be free and to
take the medicine we need to help us relieve our lifestyles and pains. Whether it be PTSD,
tremors, stomach aches, whatever. If you know it's your medicine, you deserve the right to use it.
It's just, to me, it's just really sad that people are dying and people have to fight for it.
If you cannot have access to your medicine,
what are you going to do? You go, you fight, you fight, you fight, just to be told you're going to die?
It's not right. You know, we have the access. We need to make it right for everybody.
So I'm going to wrap it up, make it real kind of quick and simple.
Medical, social,
recreational, whatever it is, you all have the right to choose if you need it or not.
And on that note, let's get ready for this great barge.
