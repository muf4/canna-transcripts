We're going to do a couple more songs, but I want to say this before that.
I want you to check out, if you can remember this, all right, hempsteadprojectheart.com.
But you can't google it yet, you got to go to that little address thing up there, right? But
hempsteadprojectheart.com. Because we want to, we're, anyway, some of us, we're of this attitude
that it's time to seriously consider hemp as alternative energy with its own identity.
That what we know where we're at with the pot and the medical marijuana, but hemp is earth
medicine. It's medicine for the earth and we want to see, we want the THC people, all right, to start
saying and making it known in a coherent, non-argumentative way that it's time to consider
hemp as alternative energy, all right? So this, and it's not, not an organization, just go out there
and make it heard the same way the medical marijuana people made themselves be listened to,
the same way the gays and lesbians made themselves be listened to. We want the hemp people to make
themselves be listened to, all right? So if you would check that site out, all right? And if you
agree with what we're about, then act on it, all right? And if you don't, then that's what it is.
