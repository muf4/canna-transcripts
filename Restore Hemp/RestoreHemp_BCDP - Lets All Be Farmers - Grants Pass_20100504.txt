This is the song, this next song I've had the privilege of playing this in front of millions of people now.
Some folks have called it the Hemp National Anthem. I call it Let's All Be Farmers.
And this is why I'm here. This is why we were all here. This is why Jack gave his life for everything that he's done.
Anyway, I love you Jack. Hope you're up there playing with Captain Ed and having a great time sitting in your 63 VW bus and smoking a fatty.
Well let's all be farmers, get filthy rich. Instead we're wrecking the planet, oh and it's beginning to bitch.
Let's all be farmers and save the trees. I can grow my own oil, thank you, without the pain please.
Let's all be farmers, the pain must stop. This is the new, the old, the original, all billion dollar crop.
Let's all be farmers and save the seas. I can grow my own oil, thank you, without the pain please.
Let's all be farmers, in that song's array. I can grow my own oil, without the pain.
Let's all be farmers, now that you know. Who am I to tell you what you should grow? Let's all be farmers.
Oh and as we watch that last tree fall. Oh well why could I be with God then? Oh I could have had a war.
Let's all be farmers.
