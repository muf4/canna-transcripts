We're going to start with something we had last week as well.
It is a bottle of Father D'Alysse's cough medicine.
Here it is, Father D'Alysse's.
It's actually a full bottle.
This is circa 1908, 1910.
It's right at 98 to 100 years old.
And this bottle contains a cough remedy
that's been shown never to fail,
according to the little letters on the side of the bottle.
And it's opium, cannabis, indica, heroin, alcohol, and chloroform.
And it's guaranteed never to fail.
It'll probably just knock you out.
You want to make sure you don't take too much or you won't even breathe.
You know, no less, not cough.
But it is an antique and it's part of the THCF Medical Museum
that you can see pictures of some of this collection on the web.
Right next to it, we have a label under glass bottle.
This is from a pocket theory or a drugstore circa the 1880s.
We have about a dozen bottles like this in our collection.
Next door, we have the cannabis hemp oil seeds.
This is seed oil high in omega-3, 6, and 9,
the LA, GLA, and LNA oils that are essential to our lives and cell formation.
I take six or eight of these a day for the good, healthy fats.
Now, if you press hemp seeds and get the seed oil out,
after you press it, you'll have this leftover, hemp flour.
Hemp flour is a protein-enriched, gluten-free, whole-grain flour
that imparts the nutty flavor of hemp into a wide variety of baked goods.
So we recommend that.
And then next door, we have hemp nuggets.
These are hulled hemp seeds.
They taste like, as we said earlier, a cross between sunflower seeds, walnuts, and cashews.
Mmm, they are good.
