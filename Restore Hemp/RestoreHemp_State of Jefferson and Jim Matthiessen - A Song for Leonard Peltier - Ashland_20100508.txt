I'm going to improvise here.
You know, I'm on a protest mode tonight.
So I want to come from some hard stuff here.
So this is a song for Leonard Peltier.
When is my brother going to be free?
Leonard Peltier down a wounded knee.
The Mohawk way up there in Canada.
My red brother all over the Americas.
First they took away Creator's land.
First they took home to the red man.
The way out there on that reservation.
For them to complete starvation.
He said he needs to build another golf course.
Start grabbing Mohawk land by force.
Babylon need a little more recreation.
Bash down another Indian nation.
Leonard Peltier, he's still in prison.
When they going to make that final decision?
They set him up, it's plain to see.
Time to set him free.
Now look what's going on down in Mexico.
The Mayans in Chiapas, they can't take no more.
Too many years they've been stuck down there in poverty.
Time for human rights and dignity.
When is my brother going to be free?
