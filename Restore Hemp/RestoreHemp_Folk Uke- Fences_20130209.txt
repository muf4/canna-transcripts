I love the way you hurt me without trying And the way you speak to me with your embrace
Sometimes when you're asleep and I am crying I can just make out the smile across your face
Crashing cars, loving you and busting fences Destructive things that I've been known to do
So if I never do come to my senses This reckless heart will go on loving you, loving you
I'd rather be a broken heart that's running Along a road that's sure to take me down
Than a heart that's never broke but knows it's coming
We were born to love and love is trouble bound
Crashing cars, loving you and busting fences Destructive things that I've been known to do
So if I never do come to my senses This reckless heart will go on loving you, loving you
It happens when my ego takes over
Can't go on living, can't go on dying Can't go on feeling blue
Can't get over you, there's no use in trying I never tried and I don't want to
Someday when I am wise my mind may wander To a better place, another point of view
Maybe then I'll have the time to sit and ponder And that's what I'll do
When I'm through I'll go back to crashing cars Loving you and busting fences
Destructive things that I've been known to do
So if I never do come to my senses This reckless heart will go on loving you, loving you
Loving you
Wow! Thank you!
