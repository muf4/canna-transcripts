Yeah, that was done even 20 years ago. I have water pitchers and things we did
made with 20, 40, 55 percent hemp fiber into the plastic beads that are used in
these injection molding machines. But most of it turned out pretty brittle.
The hemp CD cases, all of mine are broken apart. My hemp scale is, I think that was
electronics and not the hemp that fell there. But you know all these little
tchotchkes got made from this because actually it makes your beads cheaper.
The hemp is cheaper than polyester so they can mix the two together when
they're making the beads and it actually is a pretty good fill material.
And that technology is available right now. My problem with that is that
they're selling that as hemp plastic. And hemp plastic is a whole other thing
where you actually take the hemp and turn it in, you know, plasticize it
itself and you can do this with hemp. Between the hemp fiber and the hemp seed
oil are these incredible plastic parts very much like Bakelite in the end.
Just from hemp alone. And you add some perforins and things like that you get
amazing fiber things. This is going to be our future because these things are
biodegradable without killing us, you know, and all those things.
We'll learn one of these days to use hemp.
