Come climb the mountain with me, come see what we can see.
Come climb the mountain with me, and then we will all be free.

Some men plant the seed, and some men set it free.
We had 92,000 cars a day, thousands of people parking behind the FBI building, and they
arrested us and they said, you cannot do this.

So come climb the mountain with me, and come see what we can see.
Come climb the mountain with me, and then we will all be free.

So come open your eyes with me, and come see what you can see.
It's time for the world to know the emperor wears no clothes.
Come open your eyes with me, it's time for you to see.
It's time for the world to know that the emperor wears no clothes.
It's time for the world to know the emperor wears no clothes.
That the emperor wears no clothes.
That the emperor wears no clothes.
The Emperor wears no clothes.
