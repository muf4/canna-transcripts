Come see what we can see Come climb the mountain with me
And then we will all be free Some men are born to lead
Some men have destiny Some men plant the seed
And some men set it free So come climb the mountain with me
Come see what we can see Come climb the mountain with me
And then we will all be free
One man said we must hear One man's voice was clear
One man heard the call His vision speaks for all
So come open your eyes with me And come see what you can see
It's time for the world to know The emperor wears no clothes
Come open your eyes with me It's time for you to see
It's time for the world to know The emperor wears no clothes
It's time for the world to know The emperor wears no clothes
The emperor wears no clothes The emperor wears no clothes
The emperor wears no clothes
