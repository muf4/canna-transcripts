I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight on a bed of California stars.
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight on a bed of California stars.
I'd love to feel your hand touching mine.
Oh, tell me why I must keep working on.
Yes, I'd give my life to lay my head tonight on a bed of California stars.
I'd like to dream my troubles all away on a bed of California stars.
Jump up from my star bed, make another day underneath my California stars.
I'd hang like grapes on vines that shine and warm a lover's glass like friendly wine.
Yes, I'd give this world to dream a dream with you on a bed of California stars.

California stars.
California stars.
California stars.
