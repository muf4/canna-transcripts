Could you tell our audience a little bit how that came about and how you actually first
taught Willie Nelson, who's now a big proponent of biodiesel, about hemp biodiesel?
We'd always heard that Rudolph Diesel had manufactured his diesel engine run off seed
oil. We really didn't understand, quite grasp that. This was in the early 90s, late 80s.
And then a fellow from Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, came through town driving a little Volkswagen
diesel and he was running it off Burger King oil. And so we had just derived some hemp oil
out of hemp seeds. Hemp seeds are 30 to 40 percent oil by weight. You've got 100 pounds of hemp seeds,
you can drive 30 to 40 pounds of pure oil out of it. And so we had some of that and he tested it
out in his engine and he said this is the best seed oil that I've ever driven this car on.
And so we had seed oil. When Willie came in to do a benefit concert for me,
we poured that hemp oil into my Mercedes diesel and drove it about 110 miles across Kentucky.
And it was the first time in, I guess, 50 to 60 years that any vehicle had ever been driven on
hemp oil on the United States roads. But Willie told me later on, 12 years later actually,
no, I mean now about 10 years later, he says, Gatewood, he says that afternoon we did that.
It taught me what it was all about and that's the reason I started my biofuel company was from what
we learned that afternoon driving your Mercedes across there. And we were also smoking about the
biggest hooter probably road in Kentucky at the time. And there was a caravan of us. We went from
the Hyatt there and Rupp Auditorium through Frankfurt, the state capital, which is about
80 miles and then all together 120 miles all the way into Louisville, which is the largest
city in Kentucky. And then he did a big benefit concert for you there that night.
That's right.
