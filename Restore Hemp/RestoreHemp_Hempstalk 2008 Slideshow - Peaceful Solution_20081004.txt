There is a peaceful solution called the peace revolution
Now let's take back America
There's a war and we're in it
I know we can win it
So let's take back America
There was a dream, so believe it
And get ready to receive it
Now let's take back America
And when the war is over and we've won it
Remember how we done it so we don't have to do it again
