You know it was about two years ago that Jack two years ago yesterday that Jack
Harer gave his last speech from this stage. Jack Harer wrote a book called the
Emperor Wears No Clothes right here in Portland back in 1985. We call this stage
the Jack Harer stage and you know today is also 9-11 so it was ten years ago
that a lot of people died back on the East Coast and so we're coming up on 420
and we just want to remember a couple other people. Dr. Todd McCurry also got to
talk from this stage. He wrote a book about cannabis and Ben Mazzell a famous
Wisconsin activist spoke on this stage last year and he passed away earlier
this year from cancer so I don't want to give anybody a bummer here at 420 but
we're here to mark important occasion you know we want to see hemp restored.
Hemp is one of the oldest crops grown by people. Everybody agrees that marijuana
was among the first few crops that people started growing at least 12,000
years ago and it produces more food protein that meets human nutritional
needs better than any other protein out there. It produces more fuel biodiesel
fuel from its seeds and ethanol from its leafs and stalks and from these hemp
stalks and this is the official hemp stalk of hemp stalk here three years old
it from the stalks it produces more paper more fiber more building
materials than any other plant so we're here to legalize hemp and we're doing it
through an initiative petition. There's a petition booth right over there. I want
to urge you guys if you're registered to vote to sign the petition if you're
not registered to vote now is the time we've got to take control it's your duty
you know you can't stand around and say when are they gonna legalize marijuana
because they're never gonna do it we're gonna have to do it you know it's gonna
take us all working together you know no doubt about it it's not gonna happen you
know unless we all get out there and represent and educate so I urge you to
sign the petition if you can get some signatures on the petition there's some
petitions over there and you know I want to hope you are you guys ready for 420
well you know it's less than a minute away according to my clock so you know
we're here for freedom and liberty to you know our right to our freedom of
consciousness to be happy here on this planet is one of the other things we're
fighting for you know right now there's really a rapid growth in genetic
technology and gene information there's rapid growth in nanotechnology is
deminiaturized all sorts of things there's a rapid growth in artificial
intelligence within a lot of our lifetimes a lot most of you guys out
there computers are going to be pretty darn smart and if we don't protect
individual rights then the future is dire you know things like the matrix and
the Terminator are possibilities so we have to protect our right freedom of
consciousness and expand natural individual rights and I think marijuana
is a bellwether issue on that the the fact that they've taken the oldest crop
the one that produces more fuel more food more fiber and more medicine than any
other plant and they made that one illegal it's wrong so we're going to
have to get active I'm counting on you happy 420 and we'll be back
restore hemp
