I'm gonna do a Lowell George song. It's Trucker's Favorite. One of mine too. All right here we go.
Warped by the rain, driven by the snow, drunk and dirty, don't you know that I'm still
Lord I'm still
here. Out on the road late last night, I see my pretty Alice in every headlight.
Dallas, I live. I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, to Hattrop, to Tonopah,
drivin' every kind of rig that's ever been made.
Driven by the back roads so would not get way.
You give me weed, whites, and wine, you show me a sign, I'll be willing to be moving.
Kicked by the rain, driven by the sleep, had my head stoked in, but I'm still on my feet and I'm still
Lord I'm still. Smuggled some smokin' folks from Mexico, baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico.
Lord I'm still. And I'm willing. I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, to Hattrop, to Tonopah,
drivin' every kind of rig that's ever been made.
Driven by the back roads so I would not get way.
You give me weed, whites, and wine, you show me a sign, I'll be willing to be moving.
