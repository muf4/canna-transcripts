Portland, Oregon.
How's it going out there?
One, two.
Well I'm beat, I'm not beat
I'm not dead just yet
You're alive
Turn, if you see it
I'm alive
I am so pleased to meet you
If you should see
Me standing alone
Just wave goodbye
And I'll smile like I didn't need to
Give it a day
And I'll be on my way
Just a ghost
The things of the sight
That I leave
No one will ever see
You could stitch up my whole heart
It'll still fall apart
I am so pleased to meet you
If you should see
Me standing alone
Just give it a day
To get some sleep
And we'll pay for a song
So get me pleased by the trains
Where I really love
And I'll just say hello
I am so pleased to meet you
If you should see
Me standing alone
I didn't need to
And I'll be on my way
Oh give it a day
And I'll be
And see what you're missing
Cause it could get better
But you're still afraid
Yeah go back
Oh cause we could get out there
And we could see the sunlight
Oh long night
But you're still afraid
Well step out
And see what you're missing
Cause it could get better
But you're still afraid
Oh
But you're all in a song
Yeah you're all in a song
Thank you!
