Cannabis, ganja, marijuana
Educate to medicate and recreation
No medicine can do nothing quite like this
So please give me my cannabis
You see I smoke the kind of weed that you see in your dreams
Straight outta high times but you should see this green
CBD's, LNN's and that THC
And you best not forget about that THCV
Yes these are the things that your body may need
To help get rid of your pain or maybe cure your disease
So sit back with a sack of the finest trees
Growin' up and give your body what you know it needs

You know I hit that green carpet with all the pod stars
At the high time scanner it's tough man do you know where you are?
Smokin' with my friend LK in that VIP
And it's time for all dabs I guess I'll take two or three
Guessin' then we'll smoke that J and pass along those medibles
Have you seen this place man this shit is so incredible
Just think about it, weed is fuzzy I can see
So come on and legalize it give the people what they need
