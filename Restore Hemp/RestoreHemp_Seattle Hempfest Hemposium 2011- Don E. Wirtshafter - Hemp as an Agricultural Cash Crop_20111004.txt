So what you need to know about industrial hemp is that we've been able to produce it in Canada now for 14 years without embarrassment,
without any stories of kids going in and selling it in the high schools or any of these problems whatsoever at all.
And the Canadian police have been able to tell the difference between industrial hemp and pot really easily.
And our police are no dumber than the Canadian police.
They're equally dumb, I agree.
So we could do this here, and it's just political inertia, lack of any inertia in politics right now that have got us stuck in the mud and our farmers totally handcuffed.
And so the support we're hearing and seeing in Congress is from these farm belt states.
Why?
Because these farmers hear Canadian radio, and they understand that farmers up north are doing really well on this crop, and they want a piece of the action.
And we can do it here.
