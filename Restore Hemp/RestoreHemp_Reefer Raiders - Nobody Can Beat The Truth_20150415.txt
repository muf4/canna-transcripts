fighters freedom fighters and
Reefer Raiders, maybe
Ronald Reagan said people could never make the ballot that our minds are too slow. Well Ronnie my mind's not too slow
And I don't have to read my lines
Nobody can beat the truth
Absolutely
This man and I but out there telling the truth and nobody's ever said we're wrong they keep arresting us 33 times
They have beaten us in jails. They have done physical things to me
I'm not going to describe on the on this air
but there's nothing that can beat a fact and there's no and I don't care how popular a
President thinks he is when people realize that he's killed off a planet and he's killed off the knowledge of a planet
Then he's allowed millions of people to die prematurely
Prematurely and in pain and in misery and has ruined the quality of life that can be gotten with a good simple medicine that never
Killed anybody except that the hands of bad public policy and police carrying out bad public policy with a vengeance
