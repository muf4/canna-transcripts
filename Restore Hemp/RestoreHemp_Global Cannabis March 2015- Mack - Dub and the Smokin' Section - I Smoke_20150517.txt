I was so happy that I got my medical card.
To help alleviate my pain, I smoke.
To open up my super brain, I smoke.
To help me manage my life's problems, I smoke.
To contemplate on how to solve them, I smoke.
Tonight I see the rising sun, I smoke.
Give my thanks to number one, I smoke.
Prepare for my day ahead, I smoke.
Let him take me from here, fire up the ganja.
Take a little toke now, take a little toke, fire up the ganja.
Breathe out the smoke now, breathe out the smoke, fire up the ganja.
Feel it now working, feel it now working, fire up the ganja.
No more hurting now, no more hurting now.
No more pain when I fire up the ganja.
Pain go away like abracadabra.
Me love the sight of fresh munchies and laughter.
Pop a migraine, ain't no laughing matter.
Vodka then don't work for me, uh-uh.
Make my head feel too dizzy.
And NyQuil don't help me sleep.
All I need is a puff of a good three treat.
I smoke.
To help alleviate my pain, I smoke.
To open up my super brain, I smoke.
To help me manage my life's problems, I smoke.
To contemplate on how to solve them, I smoke.
Tonight I see the rising sun, I smoke.
Give my thanks to number one, I smoke.
Prepare for my day ahead, I smoke.
In take me for the hill, fire up the ganja.
Take a little toke now, take a little toke now.
Fire up the ganja.
Breathe out the smoke now, breathe out the smoke.
Fire up the ganja.
Feel it now working, feel it now working, fire up the ganja.
No more hurting now, no more hurting now.
Miss Mary Jane, yeah, she's so relaxing.
She's my prescription, she grows on branches.
She helps me deal with the aches and the pains.
I've been hesitant, all the stress far away from the brain.
No pharmaceuticals, not taking it.
I'm super, super hazy, yeah, I'm a great hazy.
Here in the Bahamas, I don't know why I'm a racist.
When Mary's with me, she's a racist.
That's why I smoke.
To help alleviate my pain, I smoke.
To open up my super brain, I smoke.
To help me manage my life's problems, I smoke.
To contemplate on how to solve them, I smoke.
Tonight I see the rising sun, I smoke.
I smoke, get my pace to number one, I smoke.
Prepare for my day ahead, I smoke.
To help take me from here, fire up the ganja.
Everybody, take a little toke now, take a little toke.
Fire up the ganja.
Bring out the smoke, bring out the smoke.
Fire up the ganja.
Feel it now working, feel it now working, fire up the ganja.
No more hurting now, no more hurting now.
