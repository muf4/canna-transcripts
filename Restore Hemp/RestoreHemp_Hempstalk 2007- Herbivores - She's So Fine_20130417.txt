Gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Gonna keep her on my mind, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
The night was sour on you, the place you looked at was like brand new,
and the mind was so blue with the view, I know she has me on my ego.
She's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
That's how it feels when you're in love, her body treats you just like a drug,
all the things you want to share with her, it's like nothing else matters.
She's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
Oh, she's so fine, gonna love her forever, live it all the time, stuff her time ever.
