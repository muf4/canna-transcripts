All right, so I think a few of you people have smoked some weed before
All right
well
I'm glad to hear that because I want to talk about the past the present and the future and get an idea of
What I'm thinking from somebody's been around for a long time, but I first wanted to start off by mentioning my dear friends
Kevin Black and Peter McWilliams both of whom are friends of personal friends of mine and
The stage is honoring them so I say honor them with high honor
Peter McWilliams and Kevin Black two wonderful activists
so
As far as the past is concerned I'd spent a lot of time in court
Working to keep people out of prison almost every day. I'm in court working on that. And so I have a very good sense
I've been doing this for 20 years plus of being an expert witness and
We're seeing a change in the way the cases are working and we're seeing a change in the attitude around the country
but we're also seeing the fact that
We're getting rollback at different parts of the world. Some of what's going on here in Washington, for example
Is not exactly what people envisioned when we passed I 502 here a few years ago to legalize cannabis
It's like the it wasn't supposed to affect medical marijuana and yet look at the problems
Causing in California, we have the legislature. It's got a bill that claims to be a marijuana reform bill
But what they're going to do is take away legal defenses for pot growers who are not licensed by the state
that we've had ever since
2003 and so that's just their idea of reform is to make it so that some people will get licenses
but other people lose their legal defense and so
The other thing that we're seeing is that this whole idea of testing people's urine
As a part of a condition for getting a job or to have a license these issues are not going away
We call it the Canada bigotry. It's like the Jim Crow of cannabis is what we're setting upon us right now. And so
Some of these things that we're seeing as we see very former things that we also are concerned about where things are going
So when we look at the past one of the things that's a big fear for me as we see this big change
That's happening now is that the history of the struggle to get us to this moment can very well be lost and we can't afford
to let that happen
We've got people who've been sitting in prison for 20 years. We've got people who've been working as activists for decades
We've got a history of people who've worked underground people who kept the jeans
Pool alive and so forth for all these decades and we need to protect and honor that I'm working with a group
That's called the 420 archive and we're trying to approach this from three different directions
the first is to get the archives of people who've been
contributors to the field of cannabis reform and
preserve them the second is to create collections and to coordinate collections of museum exhibits of
material that goes from before cannabis was ever prohibited and up through the history of
Prohibition and to create that as something that we can leave for future generations
and the third thing is they can oral art oral histories of people who've been using cannabis underground and
Going underground and working in the cannabis industry underground that have never been free to tell their stories before
So those stories of the people who risk many years in prison
To make sure that other people have some nice herb to smoke is not lost to history
So I hope you'll join us in looking at the 420 archive and make sure that history is preserved
The next thing is about the now and the now is is that as cannabis moves out of its outlaw status
We have a big fear that what's going to happen is big corporations when I come in and they're going to try to take over
control of the work that our friends and our neighbors and and the
People who've been the growers and so forth for so long have been
Working for and patent the seed lines and stuff like that
so I'm working with a group called the open cannabis project and our plan is to try to get a
final way of explaining what the different seed lines are in terms of the genetics and their effects and so forth but also
To preserve them and create the public domain record that these already exist
So that Monsanto and corporations like that can't come in and patent those seeds and make you always have to pay for it
We want to make sure that you'll always be able to grow your OG Kush and your blueberry without having to pay some
Corporation who comes in and buys that trademark away. So the name of that group is called the open cannabis project
It's got three parts to protect access to the seed lines that exist now
To protect the integrity so that when people tell you that this is a blue dream that you know
It's really a blue dream and not OG Kush
Both of which is good. I'm not knocking it down
Both of which is good. I'm not knocking either one
But you know
You want to know what you're getting right and the third thing is to get the genome map so that we will know for sure
from here on out
Okay, and so then the next thing I wanted to say is is that
Where we're heading towards in the future has things have shifted really dramatically and now we have dr
Sanjay Gupta changing his position on marijuana, which has led to the whole massive shift
Which is March last week when the New York Times came out in favor of
Taking marijuana out of the Federal Controlled Substance Act and this is really hugely important
This is something we've been saying for a long time. And now finally, we've got the New York Times joining us to say it
So I'm predicting that the future of cannabis is that we are going to see more and greater hemp fest in the future
More and greater freedom in the future a protection of what we've got an expansion of our rights
And what you want to join us in the more important things is that we need more people smoking herb and more people to understand it
And so I've written a book which is called the newbies guide to cannabis in the industry
It's going to be out this year
And so if you know people who should be smoking weed
Or you should be in the weed business and you want to make sure they get it right and don't screw themselves
It's through each other and they understand what's going on. Tell them to get a copy that book for Christmas
All right. And so then the last thing that I wanted to say is that
Save hemp fest get into your pockets and raise some money for this thing. It doesn't pay for itself
Legalization doesn't pay for itself. We need you guys to contribute. Okay, it's great that you're here today
But Steve everybody else is going to tell you
Make sure that there is a hemp fest next year by contributing when the buckets come around and don't wait for the buckets
Buy the stuff the the memementos and stuff like that
Get this thing to keep hemp fest going because without hemp fest I502 would not have passed in Washington
We wouldn't have legalization today and we and we'd all be much worse off. So please join us now
With one last cheer give me a hemp hemp hooray
hemp hemp hooray
All right. I'll see you guys on the leaf online.com
