The White House put out a statement that there's no medical value for marijuana, but yet we
know from studies and from the work of patients at a time, things that you've unearthed and
knew, that that's not true.
We know from Elvia Maseki, who's getting her medication from the government, that they
realize that there is some truth to what we say.
So how do we take a bright mind like Obama and the White House administration and make
them realize publicly, publicly, that there is a medical value to this plant?
What they always resort back to is the lack of peer-reviewed studies where there are literally,
I've got about 10,000 peer-reviewed studies on my computer dealing with cannabis.
But what they, for the most part, they're not dealing with smoked marijuana other than
early studies from the 70s.
But there are a few and more coming out now dealing with smoke or with extracts.
And one just came out last week from Germany, basically challenging the whole idea of what
the federal government is doing because there is documented medical value.
I think the only thing that really makes politicians listen is when their constituency contacts
them directly, phone, email, more importantly sometimes postcards.
And then they start to see or visiting them.
That's what they start to listen to when they realize that their positions are in debt jeopardy
if they don't follow the correct direction, really.
And I think that that's starting to happen more and more because I, having spent too
much time this summer in Washington, D.C., I now understand much more of how the game
is played.
And if we can all learn how to play the game better, then we're going to have a magnified
impact on changing things quicker and easier.
So I think it's up to the voice of the people to make it happen.
