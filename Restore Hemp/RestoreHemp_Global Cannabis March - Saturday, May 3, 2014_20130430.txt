Join with us and make a big ol' scene because if we're all together we're really loud and
they can't ignore us any longer.
It takes everybody here to go out there and to make a difference, talk to your legislature
because now they're going to be running for office, they're going to be coming asking
you for your vote.
They want your vote so you don't have to ask them where do they stand on cannabis,
right?
So ask them where do they stand on cannabis.
You're not going to stop us, they're just going to incarcerate us and it needs to end
yesterday.
Marijuana is not going to re-legalize itself and if you're not registered to vote then
you're not going to be part of making a change.
We need to stop pretending that the drug war is working, we need to stop pretending that
DARE is working because none of them are working.
None of them are working.
So please do what you can to support ending cannabis prohibition as we know it.
But you know it's real important to support the OCTA, the I-24, the SIT schools, the whatever
that comes upon you for freedom man and for what your rights are.
I mean a lot of these, they're so close, you know, they're all on this train, they're different,
they're all part of different groups but they're all on the same train and they get on that
train in the morning and they cruise forward and that's what we got to do.
Our train in our community is one train and that's the cannabis train and we all need
to get on the cannabis train and chug a lug for freedom.
