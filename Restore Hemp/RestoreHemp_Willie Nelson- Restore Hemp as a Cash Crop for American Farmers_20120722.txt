American farmers are losing their farms at a frightening rate.
For generations this land and the occupations that it provided
were handed down from father to son. And over the years
laws passed by legislators have eroded this heritage.
The government and our nation's banking system are slowly becoming this country's
sole
farm owners. So in order to turn the tide the American farmer needs a successful
cash crop.
Now hemp is a plant that's proven to be versatile in creating over 50,000
products
from cloth and paper to fuel and medicine. And when prohibition was leveled
against liquor
it was still legal to grow corn and grapes for other purposes.
Now this should be true of hemp. Return our roots to America
and help re-legalize hemp.
