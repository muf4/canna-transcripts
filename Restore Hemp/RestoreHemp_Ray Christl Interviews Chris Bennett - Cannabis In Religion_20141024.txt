Remember, all that once had to last long,
and we have, I think, filled by all,
I think it's the 28th of September,
and we have the last chance to play on the valley.
Well, okay, this is fine, but Vancouver Canada,
now to speak about his three books
on the atrocious, magical, ritual uses of cannabis,
and our history and the formation of religion
that's inside of that.
Welcome, Chris, we just love you so much.
Thanks for coming, pal.
Well, it's a pleasure, your vision is great to meet my pal,
too, Black Water Man, and I really,
I've been corresponding for years and years and years,
and meeting each other for the first time since then,
along with my Latin American friend,
but it's great to come out to America for a while.
I think you start to get used to getting a little greener
down here and feel a little more comfortable
coming across the cannabis world.
Oh, it's just wonderful having you here.
I wanted you to start off by telling us
how you got started in the movement,
and you were very well known,
I mean, you were very well before Vancouver took off,
but you got to talk about how you joined there,
and you were already well known way before Amsterdam
because of the band of the Amsterdam band,
as you call it there.
Well, you know, my story is,
you know, like a lot of people,
I got to adopt my chapter there,
I was working on it,
but then shortly after,
running out of my head in the 1990s,
I had this really powerful,
really wicked experience about cannabis
being the dream life,
and I tried to decide whether I just kind of
went crazy for a little longer,
and I didn't do it,
and I thought, well, if I don't do it,
somebody somewhere will know about this stuff
about cannabis religion, you know,
and the other people talking about it,
and I started collecting information over the years,
and years, and goodbye,
and I'm not talking about any of this,
but I'm stating the history of cannabis and religion,
you know, 25 years after that experience,
I have to tell you,
I believe more in that experience now
than I did when I had it.
You know, I want to smash you,
it's a very particular and spiritual thing,
but I'm not a fan of the experience of cannabis,
and I find it, you know,
I have a military hallucination
where God spoke to me and said,
I believe there is a God above,
and I was my opinion of the molecule of the universe,
so that was my affinity with cannabis,
and I've been searching for the religions,
uses of cannabis, and I've collected,
which has been a very hard series of work over the years,
and I'm very, very proud of it.
Doug, what would you like to say to this discussion?
Well, you know, anyway,
the way you think it, cannabis is so old and so ancient,
you know, we're talking about a plant called sapiens regulator
that was Mary's first agriculture crop,
and he was like,
based around all these doctrines and big things,
and they explained to him cannabis is the God of time,
and that God gave the big things,
cannabis, growth, and happiness.
But, you know, like the term cannabis itself,
you know, the root word,
because I've talked to the oldest group of rootstockers
of the early Indo-European order,
and the European language,
which later became the root language for French,
Dutch, English, German, Sanskrit, Persian,
and all sorts of languages,
but really the most letters on the common hand
in so many cannabis words,
like Tom brought along all the other cannabis,
and we all know about that area
because we come from that same group,
you know, here in the word.
So this is like something very, very old and ancient,
current archaeological evidence for cannabis,
you know, we have fibers of blood,
fibers of the mouth, and 12,000 years,
but tools used in the deep rotation of your mouth,
25,000 to 30,000 years.
So this is 10 to the 5,000 years.
Current cannabis use,
our monthly goes back about 5,500 years,
we can speculate that now,
but this is the oldest evidence we've found.
So on that, this is the first time
people started using it,
and that's a lot of data.
Probably I represent a sufficient amount
of writing files from the period
of writing cannabis in the Asian,
that goes to the Ukraine region,
or the Serengeti side of the Northern Indian European group.
And we were the first to investigate
the whole of Northern India,
we talked to eight groups,
that because of their sharp mobility,
and their nomadic lifestyle,
they spent cannabis throughout the ancient world.
So we have it in a variety of different cultures.
And then there's the Scythians,
they went to the side,
and then when they were far east of China,
they were called Scythia.
Yeah, yeah, that's where it came first,
in the Scythians,
Scythians would have been the descendants
of the Serengeti,
Scarapinian, Arcanian,
I should mention that this is a blanket term
for a bunch of Indo-European cultures,
and nomadic groups,
if we know the one that is correct,
the Greco-Scythian,
the Ahexian, the Caribbean,
the Caribbean region,
that were all traveling around,
interconnected,
had the same language,
and same sort of cultural tradition.
And what they would do,
is they actually would vaporize the cannabis,
they would keep it in rocks in a barn,
and then they would bring in a cultivar,
these rocks in,
and they would place the cannabis
in a cultivar,
and this would come up,
and you see them smoking it
with their heads in front of their heads,
and it got to the smoke,
and it hit a little paper,
and then, you know,
the world,
Herod,
this is the greatest,
freakiest story about this,
around 500 B.C.,
first account of the,
this is in all of Alaska,
after they came out of the tent,
and this was later documented,
that's an historical fact,
because,
you know,
they found remnants of this,
of these Sicilian dogs,
that were very,
very well preserved in Siberia,
in frozen concrete,
on the camps,
and with all kinds of different cannabis,
in the farmland,
so we know that this was the case.
So,
after the Sicilians were the ones
that kind of set up,
for the areas,
and the purges,
to start to use hay omar,
and soma,
and each year,
we have put,
has done such a remarkable job,
of,
it's cannabis in the soma solution,
where,
basically,
you prove that soma hay omar,
is a basic cannabis,
maybe with black beer,
and filter,
and other kinds of cannabis,
but it's basically a cannabis,
pursuasion,
and,
you know,
that's a thousand year old,
fifty year old,
and five thousand year old mystery,
that you solve,
along with the cannabis,
some,
you know,
you've done some major,
major work in this book,
go ahead and say where you work.
Okay, well,
the Sicilians,
besides knowing it's the Hamel,
the farm,
and the Hamer,
Gator, right,
and they actually,
you know,
probably not provided it,
in a lot of different places,
I would say,
like the origins of kale,
I mean,
comes from another ancient Uranian culture,
closely related to the,
the,
the,
the Doshi culture,
that was living in central China,
this is a Caucasian culture,
that was in China,
from about two thousand to five hundred B.C.,
and we found this amazing,
in the last decade,
these amazing puppies,
that are super well preserved,
because of the dry climate,
and the area with the temperatures,
and we found,
those are pre-preserved cannabis,
from twenty seven hundred years ago,
not female cannabis,
that was cultivated,
for psychological property,
and the Chinese name for cannabis,
is Huwa,
and I believe that,
these,
this name Huwa,
for cannabis,
would mean,
that the cannabis was actually,
from this area in China,
and I'm not saying that the TSM,
has anything to do with it,
in any way,
it's not,
it's believed to be the same area,
where these restraints originated,
as well, right,
and I believe that this,
culture Huwa,
became interpersonal,
when they found,
I mean,
I've done stuff,
where they found a four thousand year old,
couple,
that was used for the preparation,
of the inhalants,
and then they found evidence,
of cannabis,
was from the,
the pan,
panacea,
and the bacteria,
that's the,
radiological complex,
and this is a group of,
Russian archeologists,
that you're telling about,
and they,
show a pristine impression,
as well as,
scraping the parts,
used in the,
in the similar ceremonies,
where she meets with the amateur,
and he's the Persian,
and this became somewhat,
as the dialect changed,
into Indian,
and so on,
so it's the same sort of tradition,
which came from the same place,
and so we know that,
this culture here,
was preparing cannabis,
into the street,
and we know they were in contact,
with these Chinese,
these people living in China,
in the Grecian culture,
because of,
a large,
and large number of them,
had ties to their cultures together,
and then this moved into,
India,
with the Aryans,
and it became so that India,
it was used to have cannabis,
and it was used in the Soviet territory,
for a number of years,
until the Buddhism arose,
and the Buddhism,
originally,
was more of a religion of sobriety,
and in that time,
in the Vedic religion,
things like alcohol,
and cheating,
and all that were part of it,
and they all became Buddhist,
along with the original,
plant for so long,
after the Buddhism,
and then the whole,
whole medical cannabis cult,
from Belgrade to Srima,
and more of Srima,
and a huge part of India,
so they're doing this,
a lot of the work,
more of India,
and so on,
and then they made a global association,
of religious use in India,
which seems to have more,
kind of a clear message,
with the cult of Shiva,
who was an indigenous,
going to be an indigenous god,
in India,
and religious worship,
and the practice of sodomy,
which is not,
just a part of yoga,
but is a part of law,
and you know,
to survive on,
and his wife,
and their husband,
are arguing,
like, hey,
and in size,
the letters off,
and he says,
I was pushed,
and get some shit,
and size evil,
has been up to my cause,
and shows him up,
and that's how he came to discover,
that other myths,
in the world,
and how people with,
that spends that much time,
studying and in meditation,
that,
but I don't know,
what I mean is,
numbers of people,
placed in different areas,
but the last picture,
is kind of,
we're back in size,
we are probably,
maybe a few more years,
but it's interesting,
that the first couple of centuries,
we see the first couple of centuries,
we need to,
in India,
and Northern India,
is known as the 50th period,
because the 50th,
is a god,
and they were taking over,
the area,
and really,
the rest of the Shiva,
had a second century,
birth point,
from the area,
and it has a,
it came with,
the god locks,
and the old Shiva's trident,
and the rest of the Shiva,
because of the connections,
between their culture,
and the cannabis industry,
and Shiva's being,
I suspect.
Continue on this stretch,
to Greece,
and Rome,
and Asia,
and other parts,
of the world.
Yeah, well you know,
that's the,
the trade routes,
you know,
that's got the,
you know,
very interesting location,
Syria,
and the number one,
on the planet,
probably,
is also underneath,
but,
this cannabis,
is an adoption,
of the,
Indo-European,
or the Syrian language,
and,
Ashurbanipal,
came to live,
about 700 BC,
and actually,
grew up,
in the old country,
along with his father,
Ashurbanipal,
who was also a cannabis user,
in his library,
but,
he's been having,
some much,
much older,
recipes,
than most people have used,
and what's rad,
is the weather,
when he was,
his mother,
there's a beautiful tablet,
where his mother,
asked that priest,
what's the,
what are the sacred rites,
and the response,
was,
the names of the sacred rites,
are cannabis,
honey,
water,
and other fragrant plants,
you know what I mean,
so,
this really is fascinating,
because again,
this is to these Hebrew references,
of cannabis,
under the term,
cannabis,
and cannabis,
in itself,
is also,
an adoption,
of the Indo-European,
term,
Allah,
and in the Hebrew language,
it's a word,
that means cannabis,
and in Exodus,
123,
God,
in the first appearance,
of Moses,
in the place of fire,
under a burning bush,
to God,
so speak,
is only in the morning,
for about nine hours,
and God,
there's a person,
called Sidabene,
in the book of Mark,
and I have a quote,
and every time,
Moses is to speak,
to one of his followers,
and goes to what's called,
that tenth of the meeting,
and,
small and tall,
speaks much like,
the Hebrew,
and his second,
or third,
of the Hebrew,
this time,
we know that,
from our technological evidence,
and in a very similar manner,
to the Scythian tents,
they would take this holy ornament,
and place it,
over on their skin,
and,
John of Giza,
when he lost the foremost,
capital and exporter,
to the world,
he was also researching,
references to cannabis,
and the Berkeley,
medicine reference,
of cannabis,
so the word,
said would be,
that there is blood,
flowing through the skin,
and made the cycle,
of the properties,
of cannabis,
go through the skin,
very much faster,
but besides,
placing it on his skin,
he'd take some of this oil,
and place it,
on the skin,
and it would,
go down,
and it would,
go down,
and he would,
put his oil,
and place it,
on the alginate incense,
and much like a dad,
would place this oil,
on there,
and then he speaks,
along the poem,
of this oil,
of alginate incense,
and the poem,
has very,
approximate,
root meaning,
because the shepherd,
represents God's,
physical presence,
in the temple,
so when I spoke,
about Thomas Jenner,
when I was at,
Shepherd on Oxford,
I spoke,
this is,
the part of the talk,
to you,
but,
I'm not saying,
that you're a sad guy,
or is Moses,
a sad guy,
you know,
and you know,
the area,
with Moses,
the radical,
radical,
root business,
of the Bible,
because,
was Moses,
speaking,
this core main entity,
or was it like a,
shaman,
who,
attached a,
psychoactive plant,
and interprets,
the events,
of that psychoactive plant,
as either,
spiritual possession,
or spiritual contact,
at some point,
and you know,
it's important to remember,
that academies,
have specific,
in the areas of higher,
thinking and memory,
that stimulates,
those areas,
of activity,
into activity,
and what I mean,
is that,
if the president of,
all the schools,
around,
what are we supposed to do,
and then the police comes,
by and tell him,
and he's lying,
and says,
this is what you gotta tell,
the people,
and then he goes outside,
the tent,
and says,
this is what the Lord,
your God has said,
you know,
and in this,
royalty and religion,
which was also,
deeply,
intellectual,
on the Hebrew religion,
we have a similar,
use of the text,
but in just a canvas,
they would take,
a preparation,
known as,
a plan,
or a plan,
depending on the translator,
that was,
known to be a reference,
to the canvas,
and I'm very,
very,
very,
not sure,
I think,
that's fine,
we know what,
that means,
so it's also,
two or three years,
of the plan,
so we,
the enemies,
could have some,
a title,
of the common grief,
the parents,
that's what,
you're thinking of,
and this slows down,
your breathing,
and your heartbeat,
and stuff like that,
and in the,
1970,
Dr. Jamie,
Greg,
made a program,
that,
I want to monograph on,
that's a human,
hibernation,
and it's called,
Bad News,
the city of India,
taking powerful,
people,
who are dying,
and being buried,
for being dead,
being back up,
a few days later,
and then they're still alive,
because they got out,
of this,
intense,
of,
bad,
trauma.
So you suggest,
that this might,
in some way,
have been brought down,
and some of these techniques,
were used,
even,
with Jesus Christ,
where Christ,
means the anointed,
and this anointing,
is what this canvas,
about?
Absolutely,
the two references,
are,
is the,
the Greek reference,
the Poseidon,
which refers to this,
very closely,
the one,
the recipient,
which was very,
prohibited,
just the elite,
were in favor,
of this,
world-wide,
the use of cannabis,
and there was a big,
there's not,
not many people realize,
how,
the early,
early Christianity,
there's all these different,
groups of Christianity,
many of them,
are known,
under the collective,
name of Gnostics,
you must have,
their clever,
people,
who have all,
different Christian words,
and all the various,
early,
related beliefs,
and then there's the,
momentary,
that the people,
run,
and have to be,
crucified,
by God,
and they're,
persecuted Christians,
and so,
there's a very stark,
inversion,
of the world,
to the baptismal,
as well as,
the kind of,
the exposed,
pre-creation,
and you realize,
that the,
the change,
and the early,
man-pursuit,
contention,
between what became known,
as the Roman Catholic Church,
on these Gnostic,
Christians,
was the anointing of,
all births,
to water baptism,
the anointing,
and the domestic,
tax of the feminist,
government,
world century,
due to some,
Gnostic,
after the fourth,
1905,
from the,
the time the church,
was there,
and they anointed,
water baptism,
to the anointing,
world,
before initiating,
the one,
dating,
this,
and there's,
texts in there,
describing Jesus,
giving the apostles,
a box full of,
injury,
that he could heal people,
he says,
he says to them,
you have to heal their bodies,
before you can heal,
the soul,
you know what I mean,
and,
in Mark,
the oldest of the,
synoptic writings,
that are in the New Testament,
Jesus,
says that,
the apostles,
were anointing us,
to heal the sick,
and tax out demons,
and it came down,
a demon,
that treated people,
with epilepsy,
which was said,
to be demonic possession,
in the ancient world,
that would have been,
a demon crime,
not to be demonic possession,
but I believe in some areas,
like the area,
of the Moon of Irish Stone,
but,
still thought to be,
demonic possession.
I know you believe,
that Jesus was,
like Moses,
someone who was shunned,
and then used cannabis,
to heal,
other drugs,
and,
tell us a little bit,
about that,
and,
what do you think,
you know,
how we could,
see Jesus,
in a modern context,
in those ancient times?
Well,
you know,
I think part of the reason,
that was persecuted,
was that,
he took his old,
tradition,
which was supposed,
to be limited,
to the Christian,
and used it against,
the thoughts of the people,
you know what I mean?
So,
Jesus was in my book,
kind of a,
the antique cannabis,
activists,
of around 2,000 years ago,
spread,
and became more,
and the people,
of this plan,
and also initiated,
with this plan,
you know,
with the ancient,
backstop,
and the antiquity,
of a ceremony,
with incense,
and the prayer,
for the incense,
that contains a wonder,
you know what I mean?
So,
we,
and then it gets,
combined,
so there's all these,
indications,
of these things.
You believe the,
New Torres,
of the Christian church,
is related,
to the,
all,
solidarity,
traditions,
of the Hebrew,
religion?
Well,
I believe so,
but that's based,
on other people's,
research that,
that came along,
before me,
that showed,
that,
you know,
was much,
a time,
that indication,
religion,
from this religion,
was much praised,
and the summer,
25th,
was in fact,
not even,
Jesus's birthday,
it's almost 375 AD,
and it has many other things,
and,
James and Martha,
one of the,
founders of the,
of the colored church,
complained about the,
Miterranean,
similarity of the Miterranean,
people rising on their own,
and they,
they said all the Jesus,
that's worth,
that,
we knew,
was how it was going,
until they,
went back and,
started the ceremony,
and they're,
they're devil,
they're devil,
yeah the devil did it before,
where Jesus wasn't real,
so that they could,
try to do a crime,
and trick everybody,
so,
and,
there's a number of stories,
I put up in,
on YouTube video,
Miterranean is about,
one of the,
the,
meticulous aria,
that has Professor,
Carl Rock,
and Dr. David Hillman,
and,
are talking about,
the Mites of Canada,
and it seems that the,
the,
the use of,
a drink called,
what,
passed on to,
in Antioch,
had in this Miterranean,
some pretty small underground,
like,
bridles and rolling poles,
they were pop ups,
being,
during the great ceremony,
so,
so,
so it's like being,
in a room,
with the freaking smoke,
and the person,
breathing out of it,
and,
it's like,
it's more than that,
with those costumes.
And,
and,
I mean,
that's absolutely great,
they now have white people,
dressed in costumes,
much like they did in America,
green costumes,
lights,
all fires,
going into statues,
the biggest statues,
in Europe,
and,
and they were creating,
this whole sacred setting,
that facilitated,
the religious experience.
Well,
being living in now,
and,
it was in the Bible,
is not really,
a Judeo-Christian,
convention,
and,
and,
costumes,
costumes,
right,
those costumes,
were the first,
extracts,
and,
they were in their,
Kuma Lake States,
or,
I'm sure Kuma Lake States,
and I visited,
and they came back,
and this was all,
and,
and I was just glad of them,
and,
and the witches were there,
and,
I saw the,
and forgetting Buddha,
and,
and,
and all that kind of stuff,
that I thought,
was brought into,
you know,
I was sharing,
about these,
completely religious,
symbols,
can you explain,
the significance,
of,
of Egypt,
and,
and,
and the Mediterranean,
and,
and the,
the,
and the,
so on.
Well in Egypt,
Greece,
you know,
on,
on,
and this was a lot,
this was also known,
under this other term,
Al Star,
according to Dr. David Hillman,
and Professor Rock,
and other scholars,
well this is a,
reference to the,
star shape of the moon,
and at that context,
there was an infusing,
of lines,
and a music and senses,
particularly in the,
probe of Ammoniti,
was,
was involved,
when the Mercury,
Professor Hillman,
probably,
in that,
that,
in that epoch of time,
Ammoniti,
I would suggest that also Artheus, the father of Arthur,
is the Arthacon, the epitome of the Joseph,
and so we were talking about the Thracian group
in some related specifics.
I mean, Thracians probably were known as the Papyrata,
those who walk and smoke from their
conventionally-nosed academies, you know?
And there's also evidence that some of the
different people in ancient Greece
were also intimidated with them.
I've worked on a lot of the palaces up up there,
and the goddess is the thing that I was
representing for the campus,
but there are goddess Cleo, and Charmian,
or, you know, there was goddesses,
and the Olympians, and so forth.
What is the difference between the goddess
and the real patriarchs?
Well, you know, the worship of the goddess
predates the patriarchal system.
It just goes back to the age of the great mother,
where, you know, the main deity worshipped
the main religious symbol, as of the time before.
This is when animism is particularly,
she was a man who came up with the animology.
She says this is where the real animist
took place during the matriarchal period
of the great mother.
And we know that Israel,
a real ancient goddess,
she's actually an Indo-European,
and she's a continent in Syria,
and also in the Danube, in Ashurbanipal.
And this is a miscognitive,
miscognitive of the patriarchal behavior
of the Israelite.
The patriarchal behavior is,
and probably, a doctrine for the paganite worship
of Hashara, that this goddess,
this worship goes way back to the Israelites.
They're all connected,
because the schools of thought
have just spread throughout many different areas,
and different people come to different places.
The diet, the age, the taste,
the people, they're all kind of connected,
and the music connected.
And then there's the worship of Hashara,
but it's not the one that's in the Northern West,
in the same way.
And here's that, that for a long period,
Hashara was worshipped with the goblins,
you know, the Jewish goblins,
the white goblins.
And Judaism itself,
I thought that in theory,
was a little, basically,
I think, a moral,
a polytheistic religion,
the right of ladies,
that at God's right hand was Hashara,
and her cult was particularly
a focus on having venomous.
But Hashara herself,
she was a tree of life,
like the prophets of God.
Now, let's talk a little bit more
about that tree of life.
Well, as you know,
because of Hashara's association
with cannabis,
because of the association
that it had with the tree of life,
it's a phenomenon,
a property of this,
this sacramental use that goes back
to the more earlier incarnation
of Ishmaelites,
in the European monasteries,
also worshipped in that area,
later developed into Ishmael,
who was also,
cannabis was also used in worship.
And the cannabis people,
and I'll tell you a little bit about this later,
cannabis, they say that it's a sacred plant,
it sends a vision,
and it's also used for dreams
and stuff like that.
So, yeah, it's a phenomenon in there for sure.
It's like Ishmael,
who didn't choose cannabis,
but he did.
Well, I think the people
who are popular with that,
temples and stuff like that,
just found that temple worship
was a lot better when cannabis
was around, you know,
so if you want to put your cannabis back
in the tools of that people,
then we can do well
with our tenants' conversations, right?
Yeah, I think there's been a number
of articles about, scientific articles
that I've seen about cannabis
and what they do to me,
and how cannabis
is a wider range of association.
And that's probably what led
to the two,
I think it was three,
the grass roots of it,
you know, temple worship in those days,
every time there's meeting,
music going on,
and they're trying to throw something
into a microphone,
and try not to play,
because you're playing the chords,
and stuff like that.
And then you have like a rapper
getting on his beat,
and then once he's into the beat,
the rain starts falling,
you know what I mean?
The rap music itself
is specifically the rap music
without the puns and the daftness,
you know what I mean?
That that was what made it
exist when it was back then.
I think we all agree on that.
It's a problem.
Because you know,
it reminds us,
through the government,
of these institutions,
and so they would throw themselves
into this right brain trance,
and the words would start going,
and then people would write it down,
and maybe a couple of texts,
religious texts,
the period of the Bible,
the Vedas, and other traditions,
were all in verse,
and chorus, and so forth,
and that implies a sense of usability,
to getting that right brain trance,
and getting that creativity going,
and that creativity,
that was the word of God,
and that is what it is,
and all that.
And you know,
I'm sure this is up to Oliver,
and I love you.
You know, so Oliver,
so many of you,
Oliver, you're such a wonderful,
wonderful, sweet cat,
and I love you.
I love that plan,
and I think cannabis
is the paradigm shift
on so many levels,
so many levels.
But this plan was revealed,
and we did it,
you know what I mean?
We were like,
this petroleum is fossilized,
and we can't just replace it
with chemicals,
and put that in our fuel,
and plant it.
We can move it there from the soil,
but people can't,
50% of the chemicals are pesticides,
not agriculture.
And by the way,
our weapons are foreign oil,
and we can go back to the depression,
fossilized by the farm,
and they don't know it,
and they're not even curious,
and we can move it back,
and have an organic,
and have a great plantation,
so we can heal our bodies,
from things like cancer,
and diabetes,
and what we'll call,
an epilepsy,
and these different things.
Then we can heal our souls,
and we can get back,
and touch,
I can call a church,
synagogue,
temple,
mosque,
or anything like that,
that has more healing power,
in less time,
than any temple,
church,
mosque,
or synagogue,
or any group,
or bible,
or any religious text,
that has less power,
than God created.
Those things are all made
by the hands of God.
And whoever you are,
that's what I love about this group,
and it's really central,
the leadership of it,
is people being inspired by this group,
me, brother,
this brother here,
and you're going around,
I was here,
going around,
doing our thing,
because of the inspiration,
you got from this wonderful plant,
or you got,
in less time,
and less effort,
this is a paradigm shift,
and lots of people need to get behind it,
and not just people,
people need to get behind it,
but we've got to work with this plant,
we've got to make way,
for the world to get to feel it.
And that's what we're all dedicated to doing,
and everybody here,
if it's possible to do.
And so we want to thank you
for all your hard work,
and your dedication,
and we will get to the bottom of the problem,
and I might not get there with you,
with my sickness,
but I've been around Spirit,
and you've been around,
and I want to see you become
so famous for all the hard work you've done.
You know,
I've been around children from cancer age,
and you know,
at least,
you know,
I have a couple years of age,
and I enjoy doing this,
and what I'm gonna do right now,
I'm gonna do it with my own dedication,
and I'm gonna have myself,
and I'm gonna have this,
and then I'm gonna have a lot of hard work,
and it's,
you know,
it's a good thing,
and I'm gonna do it,
and I'm gonna have a new type of Irishman,
you know what I mean?
And we're gonna be good people,
and we're gonna,
we're gonna,
and people are gonna support me.
That's right, brother,
that's right.
I love doing that,
and I want everybody in my funeral to be again,
proud of the sacrament,
and God bless you,
and God bless the world.
God bless you.
