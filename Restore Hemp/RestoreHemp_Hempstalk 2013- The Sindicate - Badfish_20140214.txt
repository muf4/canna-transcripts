Hey, one more time, we're the Syndicate from Vancouver, Washington.
We love every single one of you.
We love marijuana. We love this festival.
And we love Sublime.
When you grab a hold of me
Tell me that I'll never be set free
I'm a parasite
Creeping crawl, I slip into the light
Two pints of booze
Tell me, are you a bad fish?
Are you a bad fish, trooper?
Ain't got no money to spare
I wish this night would never end
Lord knows I'm weak,
Won't somebody get me off of this reef
Baby, you're on big blue whale
Grab the reef when all duck diving fails
I swim, but I wish I never learned
What is to pollute it with germs?
Dive deep when it's ten feet overhead
Grab the reef underneath my bed
Underneath my bed, but
Ain't got no corals for the car
Ain't got no time to grow old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef
