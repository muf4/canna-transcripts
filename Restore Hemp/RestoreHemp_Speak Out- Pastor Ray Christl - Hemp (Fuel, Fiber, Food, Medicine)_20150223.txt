Industrial hemp is a strategic food and resource for fiber, which you can make
clothing, canvas, paper, and also that cellulose can be used to make the new
substance in 1936 that DuPont's wanted to just be made out of coal or out of
oil. You can use the same byproduct, you can use the same product of cellulose in
the stock of the Sensimia. In other words, we could be growing medical marijuana and
take the stock of it and make plastic to build homes for Hawaiians at very
inexpensive rates. Or we could build an automobile. I could show you a picture
real quickly here on page 50 of a car that Henry Ford made out of cannabis. I
know it's hard for people to believe it, but here's a car made out of cannabis
that not only did Henry Ford want the car to be made out of plastic made from
hemp, but he wanted it to be run. In other words, the fuel. There was a process where
you could renewably take plants, especially hemp, and after you take the
seeds off for the food to feed starving people or to feed animals or to press
that oil into the lubricating lubricants for the grease and the oil in the car. So
literally we can use plants, natural resources given to us by God, our Creator,
to solve problems here in Maui. Now, the National Review, which is the
publication of the conservative right, and William F. Buckley, who is a scholar,
has come out recently. This is the second front page in a year where he said, yeah,
it's pow people. The war on drugs is the war on drugs really lost. And he
gives 17 scholarly points in this magazine where he feels that the way to
go is harm reduction and immediate relaxation of laws against cannabis for
even recreational use.
