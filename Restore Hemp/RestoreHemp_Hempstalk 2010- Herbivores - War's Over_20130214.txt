Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going. I don't care if you're ready or not. The Portland Hipstock
is proud to present the Herbivores!
Alright. Thank you. It's a pleasure to play for you.
You know what? Hey, it's time for all the youth, you know. Listen up, man.
Girls, boys, all my peers, it's an important year, man. We've got to get out there and
we've got to vote. You know, if you're not registered to vote, please register to vote.
Let's change the laws pertaining to this plant because if we don't, they can take it back.
And we don't want that. Because as far as we're concerned, the drug war is over.
Alright, here we go.
War's over. When's everybody going to learn?
War's over. Till they get on to the herd.
War's over. Unless you caught up in the night, that's a simple night.
War's over. So let's all come together and get high.
Thousands upon thousands of like-minded.
These words just did not stick in their head.
So many give, so many more they'll take.
Until this oven turns off, it's just a half-doomed bake.
War's over. When's everybody going to learn?
War's over. Till they're all caught to the herd.
War's over. Unless you caught up in the night.
War's over. So for God's sake, let's get high.
War's over.
War's over.
War's over.
So what about it? Have you heard the story yet?
You've got to have to change it, you've got to be dead.
Given where this concerns, it ain't no lie.
We all come together sooner, we all bounce aside.
We all come together sooner, we all bounce aside.
War's over. Don't you leave until it's done.
War's over. Cause I don't know what you've learned.
War's over. Unless you caught up in the night, that's a simple night.
War's over. So let's all get high.
War's over.
Yeah!
