Thank you for tuning in. Joining us today is the leader of California's normal
Del Gehringer and he has quite a fight on his hands dealing with a variety of
changes that are occurring in his state and with it being one of the largest
states in the United States I think maybe it is the largest Texas might be
in there he has the need to find more members and the need to get a message
out to the rest of America. Thank you for joining us today. Now the politics that
California normal focuses on focuses a lot when it comes to at least the hemp
movement on the medical aspects isn't that correct? Well we have with the
recent victory in San Francisco with the proposition P has put that to the
forefront the question is what public figures do we have out there who are
willing to pick up the ball when 80% of the people of San Francisco say it's
time for a change on the issue. Really it's amazing how our politicians have
been pussyfooting about it but I was very happy to see that the city
officials of San Francisco including the leading candidates for mayor
Art Agnos and former police chief Frank Jordan and other city officials have
expressed nothing but support for proposition P and not only that we found
that by putting proposition P out there we were able to give them an issue that
they felt good about supporting that they didn't have to run and hide from.
Now I think it's time to bring that out to some of the other leaders in
California particularly in the legislature and in Congress and get the
ball rolling. Now you've come out to Nation's Capitol shortly after what it
was only like three four days since proposition P passed hasn't been very long. It's been a
week yeah. Maybe a week so you've arrived here just as quickly as the message
that that message that that that proposal being passed sent to our
Nation's Capitol. How do you think Congress and the Senate is starting to
react to this? Do you think it's going to take the attention of national candidates?
Well it remains to be seen. It's up to us. We're going to actually have to go to
Capitol Hill where I was the other day and I'm going again on Monday and I
think other people have to be doing that too talking to their congresspeople and
urging them to take a position on this issue. In fact one of the key leaders in
all of Congress and among the Democrats on the issue of medical marijuana is an
important legislator from California Henry Waxman from Los Angeles who has I
must say had a very good record in voting against repressive drug
legislation. He's been in a minority a very small minority of people who have
opposed who've actually voted no on these crime bills that come down like
the latest nominee of this crime bill. And he is also the head of the health
and environment subcommittee that deals with how what drugs how drugs get
regulated. FDA drugs and Health and Human Services which is making the decision on
medical marijuana. I think it behooves us to tell Mr. Waxman, I hope his
constituents will tell him, that they would appreciate it if he started
holding hearings on the issue of medical marijuana because I think by doing so he
would have the opportunity to really score some important some important
points that have to be scored and affect some change very quickly because
there will be popular support for this and there's no reason that he shouldn't
undertake it. So we hope that people will talk to Waxman and others urging this
kind of thing. Now you and I being together from California I'm not native
there I'm native from Indiana but I spent the last four or five years living
in the state. Know that smoke a joint lose your license seems to have some
importance to that state and we are we got to deal with that. That's right it's
on the agenda. California has got to act on smoke a joint lose your license by
October 1993 or we start losing federal highway funds. What can they do? What can
they do? Well we've got two options. We either enact smoke a joint lose your
license which is an automatic six-month driving license suspension for any drug
offense any drug offense including personal possession of marijuana
regardless of whether it's on the road or not or we can reject it by a joint
resolution of the legislature and the governor. Now the legislature does not
care for smoke a joint lose your license as does the majority of California
public at all informed opinion in California the Sacramento Bee the San
Jose Mercury have editorialized against this. There's nobody I've heard yet who's
spoken up in favor of it other than I believe the Orange County Board of
Supervisors. So why is it still in existence? But we have because the
legislature has to get agreement from the governor on what to do. Now we have a
governor who announced that he was in favor of recriminalizing marijuana and
so the universal assumption has been well gee Pete Wilson is going to veto
any attempt to pass an override resolution to smoke a joint lose your
license. We think that Pete Wilson's position is very ill-informed he really
hasn't thought through the costs of this proposal because you're going to have
thousands tens of thousands of marijuana offenders who now you know get a ticket
for smoking a joint in the park are going to be coming you're fighting
driver's license suspension. I mean they're going to get lawyers they're
going to get trials public defenders and this is going to cost the state tens of
millions of dollars and it is so stupid everyone realizes it is so stupid to
give six months driver's license suspension for somebody who has a joint
in their purse in the airport and and yet you can drive drunk and get only a
four-month driver's license suspension in California. I mean which is worse. Yeah
but if they enact the the tax situation that they've got on the marijuana. Oh
whether the tax issues is a separate issue whether they should also put a
penalty tax on that's been beaten back and I don't expect it to come back we
we did have to fight it. Senator Davis had a proposal in which he's headed for
many years to put a controlled substances tax on so if they catch you
with drugs of any kind they could say all right well you didn't pay the tax
and the tax was going to be $500 per ounce $500 per ounce of crack $500 per
ounce of LSD $500 per ounce of marijuana but they weren't $500 was not really
what you'd pay because that was the tax only if you paid it in advance if they
caught you not having paid it which is what they fully expected then there
would be a penalty and it would be $5,000 an ounce you see and Ed Davis
admitted himself this is just another way of expanding the state's forfeiture
powers all right so that if there's a lot of we can get the guys money and
this passed the Senate unanimously in California a lot of senators voted for
it knowing it was a bad bill but thinking that the assembly would knock
it down which it has in previous years unfortunately it got loose in the
assembly it didn't go through the same legislative channels it did last year
and it almost passed but we were able to alert the the important decision-makers
about that and it got scotched at the last minute and I don't think it's going
to make it but this shows the importance of watching your public
policy makers your decision-makers your City Council these proposals come up and
if you aren't aware of them I mean they can sail right through but when you say
something you can have an impact okay that's it too you say we have an impact
okay I'm calling you from Los Angeles and I want to know what can I do to stop
this what can I do as an individual well from Los Angeles first of all if you
haven't done so already please write to your state senator and your state
assemblyman okay look them up in the phone book or from your Board of
Elections if you don't know who they are and write to them saying to vote against
smoke a joint lose your license and to support an override and then what and
also write a letter to Pete Wilson which was going to be ignored or probably put
in a big pile of letters and Wade or something like that but do it anyhow
that's right because if they get lots of tons of mail I mean nothing else does
make a state well let me say state legislators don't get all that mail on a
lot of issues I mean a b 101 the gay rights issue got a lot of mail but often
they'll only have you know four or five letters on a particular bill what else
can we do that'll make a difference all right the other thing you can do is go
out and when you meet candidates like it candidates nights you know in the your
local congressman comes in town and has a public meeting ask him his stand on
that law on smoke a joint lose your license ask him his stand on medical
marijuana you know you might even ask whether people have a right Americans
have a right to smoke marijuana in the privacy of their personal lives okay I
wouldn't ask him to take a position on legalization no politician is going to
say yes to that at this particular moment so let's not waste our breath but
let's focus on what's at hand it's medical marijuana it's smoke a joint
lose your license and we'll talk about more of that when we come back right
after this with us today is the head of California normal Dale Gerringer Dale we
have some elections coming up in 1992 we always have elections coming up but the
candidates in 92 are the ones that we're focusing on primarily now as an as a
voter who's concerned about getting the propositions that we need taking care of
and into office and implemented I want to be able to find out how my candidate
votes I want to be able to find out his background I want to be able to find out
how I can make a difference when I get ready to cast my ballot well join
California normal and California normal reports makes a point of giving you the
information about how people are voting and we've been following people the very
interesting votes have been occurring in California and people are not very aware
of them I think the smoke a joint lose your license vote was a particularly
interesting one this was a vote that was taken by Congress to force the states to
change their laws it was specifically aimed at marijuana decriminalization by
Bill Bennett and and Senator Alphonse D'Amato and Representative Jerry Solomon
well-known right-wing reactionaries from back there who voted for it in
California well most of all the Republicans did with the exception of
Tom Campbell who's running for Senate a lot of the Democrats did too though
including some supposedly very liberal ones a notable one being Barbara Boxer
who is running for Senate also the same Senate seat from San Francisco and
Barbara Boxer fancies herself to be an advocate of civil rights and personal
freedom and abortions rights and our right to control our own body and she
makes a very vociferous show of being pro-choice but when you ask her about
marijuana she says well you know I don't think it should be legal and I don't
think people should go to jail but it shouldn't be legal to use it and she
defends her vote on smoke a joint loser or you lose your license and on no
particularly good rational grounds she's basically a prohibitionist she doesn't
like drugs at all she said she'd like alcohol to be illegal if you know if
that would help things out well it sounds more to me like she was trying to
stop personal rights right well we tried so we so we told I mean the obvious
contradiction here is here's somebody who says she's pro-choice she's pro
abortion she's not pro-choice and we confronted her with that at a couple of
fundraisers for her where we approached her and we the people in her campaign
are people who are very are friends of ours okay they agree with us on these
issues they don't know that Barbara Boxer had this position until we went up
to the in the Democratic Convention in Oakland and talked to them to fundraisers
and talked them so do you know how Barbara Boxer is on marijuana in fact an
incident that happened just a couple months ago before the recent tragic
death of Bill Graham Bill Graham had a fundraiser for Barbara Boxer up at his
beautiful Marin home which is a psychedelic museum of I'm just thrilled
that I was able to see and I'm glad I met Bill Graham too before he before he
passed away but I went up there along with Ed Rosenthal and Eric Harlow we
paid a hundred bucks to get in we had we got a nice party there too and we went
around and circulated and talked about things I went up the Barbara Boxer
introduced myself tried to try to try to make overtures and she said well she
didn't agree with us on the marijuana issue blah blah blah and so we went over
and talked to Bill Graham and Ed Rosenthal buttonhole them and we told
Bill Graham the story and Bill Graham said what Barbara Boxer doesn't
understand weed why that's an important issue I'll have to tell her about it and
sure enough the afternoon went on Barbara Boxer gave a speech in which he
went on about civil liberties and everything else said wonderful things I
had to agree with everything she said in her speech she never mentioned drugs
went on to a fundraiser auction first prize in the auction for tickets to the
New Year's Eve Grateful Dead concert boxes holding up these tickets like hey
now come on this is the hottest tickets in town everybody's got to go to the
Grateful Dead concert to have two different codes but you're good yes well
anyhow so after all of this happened Bill Graham finally came up to say what
he had to say and it was very simple he said well look I really agree with
99% of Barbara Boxer's positions but I have to say there's one thing I disagree
with her on you know I don't want to talk about drugs but it's been 500 years
since we came to this continent and people still aren't free to plant the
seed sure so now do we have some kind of lobby going in Cal do we have a well
normal involved with the lobby I try to do that and I have friends and and
there's a network of people who who work on particular representatives in
some case all it's all volunteer but we have phone trees which need to be
developed especially I would say in Southern California so that we can get
we can get phone calls through to a legislator's office if a key vote is
going on and saying hey we care about this vote because that's an important
thing to do it's if smoke a joint lose your license comes to a vote we want
people phoning the Senate Judiciary Committee on the day of that vote and
we'll let people know when that comes but yeah because oftentimes the people
that are making these statements and making these policies have a
multi-million-dollar budget to work with for their campaigns and are able to have
you know a press releases put together for them and so on and the people who
are opposing these particular viewpoints are coming from their heart the
working-class heroes and are working on a budget so we need to find some way to
work together what do you suggest when it comes to that state of the size of
California how would you pull us together that's a real tall order and
we're a long way from having a single organization as you're aware there's a
network of groups in California that I think we're just going to have to keep
developing for a while I see you know many different people working in many
different places that's on really it's a county by county basis and different
counties have their expertise and I try to handle Sacramento affairs and you
know press relations and stuff like that for the and keep people informed through
the newsletter as for you know more developed organization time will bring
that or it won't we may not even need it but it is important for us to get
actively involved now how is it that normal makes its policies when it comes
to supporting various groups and various proposals and amendments going
to the state how is it that you make your selections an awful lot going on
out there there's not that many issues that are strictly marijuana there's
usually about two or three bills a year in the legislature that really deal with
marijuana usually its status quo all right and basically we get in there to
try to oppose bad stuff and that every year there's a bad bill a couple years
ago for instance there was a bill by when Van de Kamp was still Attorney
General they wanted to establish 10 plants is the absolute limit for
personal use cultivation so anybody who was caught with more than 10 plants is
an automatic felon not eligible for diversion regardless of whether they're
a medical patient or whatever and everybody who knows anything about
cultivation knows that's completely unrealistic and not what personal use is
and basically we're the only people who know about personal use the legislature
doesn't and neither does law enforcement so and so by going to the legislature
and just talking to the people who are sponsoring this bill and explaining well
look this has nothing to do with personal use you're gonna get in all
sorts of lawsuits on this sort of thing this is unreasonable debunking the
statistics that they had a cop come in and try to say that one plant grows a
kilogram of marijuana well yes one plant on a government marijuana farm with no
helicopters above it may grow a kilogram of marijuana but we know that's not the
way marijuana is grown we said that we convinced the committee it wasn't hard
to do because we did have the facts on this so bills like that you know don't
come around that often okay but now when it comes to focusing your energies to
you have to be very select and the type of people that you send us front people
and at the same time you're also focusing on groups and the muscle behind
that who does does most of the structuring throughout the state I know
you've you've headed up how is it organized is it done by large cities is
there a lot of people like in LA it's a network it's a network of people that we
phone not all of whom are official members of California normal which has a
very indefinite struck a indefinite structure is not right we do have bylaws
but that we're probably going to have some reorganization of our own just as
national normal is but we've got about a minute left and if you had the
opportunity to say one thing that was most important to the California
citizens as well as those people across America who are seeing this what would
be your statement well I think you have to really demand of your Congress people
and your elected officials to stand up for your right as an American citizen to
smoke marijuana it's real simple and we've got to state it in those terms and
raise the issue whenever you encounter them whenever you confront them ask them
to state their stand you know we've been trying to get you on the show for a long
time and it's been a pleasure I like to have you back again as soon as we can
work it out and it's been a pleasure to have you tune in if you have a chance to
make a difference in your community do it go out and find some change that you
can contribute to and make somebody's life just a little bit happier until we
get together again keep happy keep strong keep wise
