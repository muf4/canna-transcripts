I've been working with the Safer shirts ever since I read the book, Marijuana is Safer,
So Why Are We Driving People to Drink? by Steve Fox, Paul Armentano, Mason Tverk, with
Forward by retired Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper.
I'm an occupational safety and health professional, and I believe an employee who comes into work
after a night of drinking is more dangerous than an employee who comes into work after
a night of smoking.
It's part of the reason why I'm working with Re-Illegalization, we have the short sheets.
You've probably seen a petition that can hold 20 signatures, somebody standing out in front
of Walmart asking you to give the chickens larger cages.
But with our petition we also have another option called the short sheet, it only holds
four signatures, but it also folds into its own envelope, so you get a couple of signatures
from your friends, put a stamp on it and mail it in.
Instant activist.
Check out Re-Illegalization.org and look for Safer shirts on the internet.
There's a lot of information to be found there, read the book Marijuana is Safer, So Why Are
We Driving People to Drink?
Thank you for coming to Seattle Hemp Fest.
