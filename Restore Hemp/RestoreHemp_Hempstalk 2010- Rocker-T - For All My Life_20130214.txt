For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
And throughout my life I've always been a ninja
For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
And throughout my life I'll always be a ninja
Ayana will never run away
No matter what the wicked man muffy say
No matter how them turn or how them stay
Ayana will never be the man I'm in love with
As Babylon crumble to the ground
I knock on the block and make the ghetto drum sound
I focus on meditation
Cause Babylon time come and gone
In my life I'll always be praising the most high job
And throughout my life I'll always be a ninja
For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
And throughout my life I'll always be a ninja
I give thanks and praise for the blessings that we share
But still the people them bawling over the Babylon
When I see them howling
Still I give thanks and praise cause I know I'll be standing there
To Rastafari's calling
And I know that the Babylon walls are falling
And still I keep praising the most high job
And throughout my life I'll always be a ninja
For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
And throughout my life I'll always be a ninja
I love to teach them better kind of divinity
I love to bring them more positivity
I love to give them roots and charity
But they are drawing them curses, yeah, I know when you see
You can't feel sober anymore
If all you've to drink is red bull it's for sure
So mind where you get your food from
And before you go and go and yam, put in now your life
Some ices and praise to the most high job
And throughout your life remember to wear your ja-ja
For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
And throughout my life I've always been a ninja
For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
Throughout my life I've always been a ninja
For all of my life I've always been praising the most high job
Throughout my life I've always been a ninja
For all of my life
