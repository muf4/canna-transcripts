Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Johnny Hart, take it to me, baby.
So listen close, y'all.
I'm smiling, crying, inviting my time.
I keep singing, man, I'm bringing the dopest of rhymes.
And though our leaders are all liars,
ain't no need to be pining.
Just pass the jug of wine and y'all see.
You know, I got to thinking while we're drinking
and the shrinking that sound.
Sheep and she-bop, come on, everybody,
let's pass that round.
While the owners of this country,
they're tearing it all down to the ground.
Now, they ain't making a single sound,
but they can't silence me.
Because who knows, someday I just might be famous,
but more likely end up looking like a damn Dignoramus.
Blow the glass and we'll grow the grass,
but good Lord done gave us.
It's all that can save us now.
All that can save us now.
We position for a mission that we must undertake
to gain favor.
Now, don't waver because there's so much at stake.
And though our leaders slowly bleed us,
man, how much are we going to take, y'all,
for Joseph and Mary's sake?
When are we going to wake?
Because who knows, someday we all might be famous.
We'll find 10,000 like-minded crazies to claim us.
And blow the glass and we'll grow the grass,
that the good Lord done gave us.
It's all that can save us now.
Oh, I said, who knows, someday we all might be famous.
Fly right by the moon and go circle Uranus.
And blow the glass and we'll grow the grass,
the good Lord done gave us.
It's all that can save us now.
Now, I'm going to back it down just a notch.
Now, let's sit close.
See, you ever been to a drunken brawl?
You know the kind where the cops get called?
There's always someone getting hauled away to jail.
Yeah.
You ever see a stoner picking a fight
to maybe crack a couple of skulls on a Saturday night?
Yeah, me neither.
I doubt you ever will.
They been lying to you.
So now, please, dig my little truth, y'all.
Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
We're just a band of hippies that won't burn one down.
And then we'll eat.
And then we'll fuck.
We'll probably fall asleep.
Or maybe drive the truck 10 miles beneath the speed limit.
I don't get it.
Tell me, what's the fuss about?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I got to know.
You know, I really hope when I wrote the song
that the message would be real strong so some folks,
they might one day understand.
Now, yeah.
That alcohol has killed so many more than green bud ever will.
Look, let's keep on scoring.
You know, a matter of fact, you can't OD on weed.
They been lying to you.
Dig my little truth.
Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
We're just a band of hippies that won't burn one down.
And then we'll eat.
And then we'll fuck.
We'll probably fall asleep.
Or maybe drive the truck 10 miles beneath the speed limit.
I don't get it.
Tell me, what's the fuss about?
Somebody tell me, what's the fuss about?
We're just a band from Spokane that's got to burn some down.
And then we'll eat.
And then we'll fuck.
We'll probably fall asleep.
Maybe drive the truck 10 miles beneath the speed limit.
I don't get it.
Tell me, what's the fuss about?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Said, who knows?
Someday, we just might be famous.
Might buy the moon and go circle Uranus.
And blow the glass and we'll grow the grass.
The good Lord gonna give us.
It's all that can save us.
I'm Tommy G from the 509.
These are the legends after 11.
We thank you, Hempstock.
Thank you so much for having us.
And we're looking to come forward
to coming out and party with you guys.
Stick around.
We're going to.
