I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight on my bed
Carrying bones tonight on my bed
Of California stars I'd love to feel
Your hand touching mine, oh tell me why
I must keep working, I'll lay my head tonight on my bed
Of California stars I'd love to dream
Troubles all away on my bed
Of California stars jump up from my star bed
Make another day under me
Of California stars they hang like grapes
On vines that shine and warm a lover's glass
Like friendly wine as we give this world
A dream, a dream with you on our bed
Of California stars I'd love to feel
Your hand touching mine, oh tell me why
Of California stars I'd love to dream
Troubles all away on my bed
Jump up from my star bed
Make another day under me
Like grapes on vines that shine and warm a lover's glass
Like a friend give this world
To dream a dream with you on our bed
