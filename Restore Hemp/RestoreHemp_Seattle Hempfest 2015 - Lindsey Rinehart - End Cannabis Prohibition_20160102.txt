What does it do for you? How does it affect you?
How much taxes will they get if they include you?
Because sometimes it's just the money.
In Oregon, if they decide that they don't want to participate, they don't get any of the money.
I'm kind of looking forward to see how well that plays out for them.
All of a sudden, Portland is going to become uber, uber rich.
In cities like Sandy, right next door, who boldly spoke up to my friend and told him,
No, you may not open a dispensary here.
Well, why not? How come I can't open a dispensary here?
Oh, because we don't like you.
How is that acceptable?
If your city or your county tells you, we don't want you here and we don't like you here,
you need to stand up and tell them, I'm here and you're going to like me.
You're going to accept that I use cannabis and I'm going to vote you out if you don't.
Because your vote counts and your money counts.
I love you guys. Please share love. Please be respectful.
Please put money in the bins. This festival is expensive.
We love you. Speak up.
