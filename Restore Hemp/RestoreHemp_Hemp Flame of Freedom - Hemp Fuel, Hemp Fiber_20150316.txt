As long as people are just being locked up for cannabis, then we've got to change those
laws and we've got to restore hemp for energy, folks.
That's the real key here.
The whole reason marijuana was prohibited was to stop this, to stop hemp fuel being
used.
Now this is hemp seed oil with a piece of hemp twine here.
This is next week's wick right here.
And you can burn this in any diesel engine with no conversion to the engine today.
You can pour that right into your diesel engine and turn the key and drive.
And that's the reason it was made illegal.
It's the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, military, industrial, transnational, corporate, elite,
crony, capitalist, ruling class that have brought us hemp and cannabis prohibition.
