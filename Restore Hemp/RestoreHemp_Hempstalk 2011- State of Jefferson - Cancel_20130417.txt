Portland, how you feeling?
We're coming at you from Southern Oregon.
It was a long, long drive.
But I heard the Ducks won, it's a green day.
How you all feeling?
When you see your brother, man, don't put me down.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Boy, you know that little thought will stick around.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Hold on to me until we walk the steps of Zion.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
When you see your brother, I'll be marching like a lion.
You got to follow the positive vibrations.
Got to follow to the rising of the moon, yeah.
Got to follow the positive vibrations.
Got to follow.
Bring it low.
Yo, PDX, this is Mikey Stevens.
When you see your sister, don't put her down.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Boy, you know Jolly Good Children will be running around.
Rhythm!
Hold on to her until she walks the steps of Zion.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Then you'll see your sister and shining with her light on.
You got to follow the positive vibrations.
Got to follow.
Y'all are in tune to the state of Jefferson.
How you feeling?
Got to follow the vibrations.
And now mix me up.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
One time!
