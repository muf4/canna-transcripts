Don't them know that we know In all the struggle we'll fight every time
Don't them know that we know In all these times we'll fight for our lives
Don't them know that we know In all the struggle we'll fight every time
That I and I will never give up
No college plan, I'm surely no professor
I'll take this stand, we gotta make things better
Here is my question, that I'm a mustang
Is there a place where I can go
A place where peace and unity dwell
Is there such a place, no man I can tell
And as for freedom, that I'm a mention
Don't lose your focus, don't lose your head
Don't let them know that we know
In other's struggle, we'll fight every time
Don't let them know that we know
In other's times, we'll fight for our rights
Don't let them know that we know
In other's struggle, we'll fight every time
Don't let them know that we know
That I and I will never give up
I'll take my stand
I'll never give up
Like Michael Franta used to tell Casper
You never give up
You never give up
You never give up
Like John Trudell used to tell me
Yes, sir!
Drop it!
I'm in no hurry
Big up to the Dub Trotter crew
Respect!
