We're gonna like back the state of Jefferson on one here a little bit
It's just a blend tonight. How y'all doing?
Just want to let you all know it was it was at the last hip stock last year that I first met Jim
If you didn't notice he's a pretty he's a pretty you know noticeable guy
So I saw him walking around and I I loved his music. So I said hey Jim, you know, what's up?
I'm Joe where the state of Jefferson and
Come to know we're neighbors in the state of Jefferson since of the term we only live a couple hundred miles away from each other
so
since last time stock we've been hanging out playing music and
you know kind of just being friends and
And so it's really a pleasure to be here with these guys and have the state of Jefferson here at this year's hemp stock
So thank you all very much. This was for all our ganja planters in the house

See helicopter flight
We're flying through the air, oh, what do we want to call it?
Call it weed, oh, they'll never cover us,

and I will oversee them, bring the fertilizer to my men.
You think it's all out of control,
we gonna grow the ganja upright under their nose, I say.

Deep down here we are, we put the ganja over.
