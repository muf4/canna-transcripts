There is a peaceful solution called the Peace Revolution
And now let's take back America
There was a dream, so believe it
Now get ready to receive it
And we'll take back America
There is a war and we're in it
And I know we can win it
Let's just take back America
And when the war is over and we want it
Let's remember how we done it
So we don't have to do it again
