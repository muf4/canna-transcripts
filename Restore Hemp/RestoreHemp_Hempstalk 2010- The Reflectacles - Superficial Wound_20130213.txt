♪ Now she wanders as she kneels
♪ This one realizes they're looking for her
♪ Like
♪ Superficial woman
♪ I sat beside the man who was
♪ Doing all the things that he told her
♪ And after quite a while
♪ He finally laid his weary head upon my shoulder
♪ He said, it's tragedy my son
♪ That you're a woman
♪ You think the world can't get no gold
♪ And
♪ Till the man who's never a man
♪ Well
♪ Superficial woman
♪ I've been out of the rain
♪ I've been sinking once again
♪ I've been staying just fine
♪ I've been out wondering more
♪ I'm now out wondering more
♪ She moved herself out west
♪ To the far, far down
♪ With a little less distraction
♪ Now she wanders as she kneels
♪ This one realizes they're looking for some action
♪ And she swears
♪ She won't be satisfied
♪ And all the friends are watching
♪ Till the stick from her feet
♪ And the knee
♪ Why would you say
♪ Ooh
♪ Come on
♪ Now hold on tight
♪ As she walks off into my realm
♪ Superficial woman
Thanks so much.
