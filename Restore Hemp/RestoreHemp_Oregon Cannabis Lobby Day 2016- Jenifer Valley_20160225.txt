Good afternoon, my name is Jennifer Valley and I'm here to encourage all of you to become involved in the health care discussion.
Reality is medical marijuana is the most significant and important health care program
Oregon offers and it's being completely ignored by the health care transformation.
Oregon Health Authority is the program that runs Oregon Medical Marijuana Program and they have meetings every
week, sometimes three or five of them. No one person can get to them all.
Some of them are downtown Portland. Some of them are in Salem. Some of them are in Wilsonville.
But the reality is we all need to be there. We need to be there telling our stories.
We need to make it clear to them that the war on drugs is not doing as much good for us as it is
bad for us.
I had my cancer ignored by my doctor for four years because she was too busy worrying about the fact that I smoked pot
to practice medicine in my exam room.
I'm sure I'm not the only person with this kind of story and we all need to be telling the Oregon Health Authority our
stories. It's our community. We need to be part of it and they're the ones who run the medical marijuana program.
They're the ones who need to be educated. So I encourage you all to look up Oregon Health Authority's calendar and go
down and hit a couple of their meetings. Hit a bunch of their meetings. Send them letters. Whatever you can do to make
your voice heard. Now is the time because right now they're getting ready for the 20s for the next session. So if you
want bills for us instead of only bills against us we need to be there setting the platform and telling them what we
want. And now's our opportunity. Thank you all.
