Okay, this is a song about us.
Okay?
We are many, and we are strong.
We are many, we are strong
And so many, we're so wrong
Giving in to many lies
Doesn't anybody really care why?
Can it be that we are right?
Can we be peaceful through this fight?
All we really want to see
Is humanity set free
We're just one big family
Once united, we are free
Now's the time to make a stand
Do the best that each one can
We're just one big family
Once united, we are free
Now's the time to make a stand
Do the best that each one can
Once awakened, we will see
The potential of infinity
And abundance will be the norm
We are finally through this storm
Can it be that we are right?
Can we be peaceful through this fight?
All we really want to see
Is humanity set free
We're just one big family
Once united, we are free
Now's the time to make a stand
Do the best that each one can
We're just one big family
Once united, we are free
Now's the time to make a stand
Do the best that each one can
