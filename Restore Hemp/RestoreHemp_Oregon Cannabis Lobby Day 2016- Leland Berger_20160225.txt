Hey everybody, thanks for coming this afternoon to the state capitol to
Rally about our efforts to continue to improve
the reforms brought by
by ballot measure 91 and
And to help protect the medical marijuana act
and
Things are changing very rapidly, and I'm not sure that we're all on the same page necessarily
And I'm not sure that my information is the most current information, but people should know that
What differentiates this lightning round?
round short session from previous sessions is that the legislature has been
responsive to our concerns
They've been in touch with the health authority and the health authority has pulled back on some of the rules
They were going to impose on medical marijuana growers
the Senate co-chair at last week's meeting announced that instead of March 1st as a date for
grandfathering that it would be May 1st
So so you know we are seeing progress we are seeing
Improvement we are seeing
You know some good technical corrections. We all left those of us who've been coming here for a while. I've been coming here since 1999
We'll remember that last session
We left the building thinking that as long as it was a private club and didn't have employees
There could be cannabis cafes and then when the health authority issued rules that said that couldn't happen
We contacted
Legislators and there's an amendment to 1511 that's being proposed to amend the indoor clean air act to
allow for cannabis cafes
thanks mostly to the good work of Harrison Conley a former legislative council has been lobbying on behalf of
the world famous cannabis cafe and Madeline Martinez
I
Was a little surprised to hear about this rally since sir
You know just because usually there's more
kind of advance notice it gives people an opportunity to get in touch with their legislators or legislators from the
What's now the Joint Committee on legalizing marijuana?
and I just want to encourage you all to
to do that to make those appointments and
Schedule times and to visit with people if you know it's not likely you're going to be able to see anybody today
But you can certainly come back while the legislature is in session or in between sessions
Is an especially good time to catch up with legislators and because part of the problem is
You know I like I say I've been coming here since 99 and back then you know Sandy Burbank was here layered funk
Sometimes John Sajo would come down from the mountain
You know and and and me and and the only person in the building
That was being paid to be here every day that was on our team was the was the ACLU
And it was like that more or less for a long time Madeline and others were here in 2005
when we passed Senate bill
Was it 1805 1705 whatever number was the bill that expanded the medical marijuana act?
But last session suddenly there was an explosion of lobbyists on our issues
And they were lobbyists for the industry for different portions of the industry for individualized
companies and
Some for organization including the Sun grown Growers Guild and the Oregon Cannabis Association
But but the problem is that there wasn't anybody here for the consumers for us
and so I went and met with
folks at Portland normal and started a
Legislative committee and
Lindsay
Reinhart who's
I'm not here right this minute is is now the voice of consumers in this building
So if you if you have issues that you think are important to consumers that you want in front of legislators get that information
Get that information to to Lindsay
Yeah
Yeah, I think I think that's that's mostly it I think that that you know
The important thing is I know that people get together and rally when they're angry and upset and there's a sense of outrage
But I want folks to know that
in the first place
The legislature is being responsive, but the thing that you can really do the thing that you can really do is
Lot many legislators on the 91 committee
Have a bad view of the medical marijuana program they've been misled about the medical marijuana program
they believe as a matter of fact that overwhelmingly most of the
Medical cannabis is cultivated was leaving the state when that's not true
They believe overwhelmingly that anybody can get a card and that and that most people in the program are scamming the system
And they're going to continue to believe that unless and until
Those of us who are honest participants in the medical marijuana program make ourselves available to
legislators and tell them the truth
Okay, because you know these again. You know some of these folks. There's a guy on the panel
Who's friends with a guy who has MS they believe in the medicinal value?
We've won that argument
We're making that stuff up, but they are concerned about about the abuses that have been publicized
And they are going to make reforms to change those and including the reforms that they made already
We're not going to get that stuff back
But we can we can move things forward if we present
Honestly who the patients are who the growers are what's really going on so thanks again for coming and as always I'm around
I'll be available for questions
My name is Leland burger. I'm a lawyer in Portland
I practice statewide for with the Oregon Cannabis Compliance Council LLC
And I'm also chair of the legislative committee for Portland normal which meets on the first Monday of each month at 8 o'clock
at the Northwest Cannabis Cafe at
13th and Powell in
Portland, thank you so much
