Seems like everything's cooler in a different way
Before the parker show and Mabel came home
I hope for such an echo that soon finally
Nobody will let it go
Running back and forth, looking to my mistake
The only answer and you're running the wrong
When time is sick and stripping what you want to
Screaming this house just ain't home
There's no room there to run to
The only course to hold you
To sit back and watch it explode
Seems like everything was easy when we grew to hate
But today the strings of evil arose
Pummeling through the pavement like a wheel of fish
To get to a supporting chair we all decompose
Running back and forth, looking to God and people
The only corner seem to lead to the road
When time is sick and stripping what you want to
Screaming the Avengers won't let you go
When there's no room there to run to
The only course of action to hold you
To sit back and watch it explode
There's no where to run to
When the war comes on
And it's what you want to sit back and watch
When there's no where to run to
When the war comes on
And it's what you want to sit back and watch it explode
