And we need to free the people who are in prison for pot. We need to free the children who are
held hostage by CPS away from their loving families
And we need to restore the rights of those who have been stunted by felony drug convictions
fairness equality social justice equal opportunity
Just injustice is here and it's happening
Now the human solution is going to come up and give a message and they may talk about Shauna Banda who is fighting today for her 11 year old son
Marijuana changed her life and she educated her community and her son and when he corrected the school that was giving misinformation
they took that 11 year old in, kept him in custody, raided his mother's home, took her medicine and her son and she's fighting for him and that's today
And even in Colorado where I remind you marijuana is legal
Angel Price Lane was taken from her parents when she was 11 months old because her father said he recreationally smoked marijuana occasionally I remind you again it was legal
Within a month that baby was given to a 19 year old who had 3 other kids and she died that month a blunt force to the head, repeated blunt force to the head
There are people who are losing their jobs, there are people who are losing their children and there are people in prison
And it is our right to be here, to speak and to exercise those rights but it's also our duty to be the voice of those people who can't be heard because they are in prison
or they are held, their children are gone
So we need a bill that automatically causes review of anybody serving time for pot
We need protections for parents so that responsible use is not a reason to take kids away
And in the 4 states in DC that have legalized recreational use and in the more than 20 states that have medical laws
Nobody has protected prisoners yet so make it a part of every cannabis conversation
Justice, equality, equal opportunity and join me, join normal, normal women of Washington, equal, justice and liberty for all
