Maybe we can expand on why it's seen as a good thing that the OLCC regulates recreational marijuana when presumably
They don't have any experience with cannabis. I'd be particularly interested on the consumption side of it as far as monitoring
You know the
OLCC, you know, they they have experience with alcohol. They have experience with licensing rules regulations audits sting operations
Collecting taxation and so they have experience dealing with you know a relatively similar
Product so it's all the government agencies go
They just happen to be the best one for this program the Oregon Health Authority was with some experience dealing with medical cannabis
Really made it clear that they only wanted to stick with medical cannabis and didn't want to move it to adult use over 21
So we really didn't want to have an antagonistic relationship with a government agency that didn't really want the regulations
Starting a brand new regulation. Unfortunately, there are startup costs associated with that and
And so when you start off with the state saying this brand new agency is going to cost 22 million dollars a year
For whether that's true or not that really puts you in a tough position to win the election
so the OLCC, you know has experience with these type of rules and regulations and
They are definitely looking to be educated from patients consumers
People in the industry how Washington and Colorado is gone and they're definitely looking to have you know
Work groups around the various issues to educate themselves
And that's one of the reasons why we give the OLCC a full year to develop the rules and regulations
So they have time to to learn about cannabis bring in experts and pass that you know common-sense rules and regulations
That's one of the things that was impressive for me is that ensuring that you have an agency that actually has some expertise in
regulations of
substances this is
From my perspective what new approach Oregon was able to do is come together with a existing facility
So you would not find us needing to actually start from ground zero as Anthony says
One of the things that is very important to myself and many people that serve in the legislature
is that we do away with the black market or the underground market and
by having the
Taxing structure that they have placed in in order to move forward actually will give us that best opportunity to undercut
We've seen historically when you look at what happened with alcohol when it was prohibited and when it came back
You can actually have the impact of undoing
the cartel type of
philosophies by actually having a well regulated
Industry I also believe that the OLCC knowing for my discussions from the executive director
They're not waiting until this passes
They're already there as Anthony says working and watching and seeing from those who are actually
Implementing in Colorado as well as what's happening now in Washington to be ready for
What is going to come forward and the I guess not saving grace?
But I think the part of having a deep breath and ensuring that we move forward in a positive light
Is that there is a one-year incubation to actually have it up and running?
But clearly I can tell you right now that Steve Marx who is the executive director of OLCC?
Has been on the phone with me and he has made it very clear that he's working with the Department of Ag as well as
The Oregon Health Authority because of the measure itself deals not only with the recreational part
But also brings forward some of the stuff I've worked on in distal hemp and also where you have the medical part
And I think we'll get into some other questions that we're going to greater detail why it's so important that this
Measure the new approach Oregon is put forward actually calls out that we're going to maintain a separate
System for the medical and it's not going to be blended into the retail such as what has been discussed at the Washington State
So let's let's address that what what will happen to the oracle Oregon medical marijuana program if this passes and if
OMMP continues will there be separate dispensaries for medical and recreational purposes?
Well, I guess starting off from where we're at yes
I expect that they will one on P is going to stay in place the new approach measure IP 53
Calls that out distinctly says it will stand alone
The important part of that is because I think the needs are very important for all of us to realize as to exactly
What that program was set up for and what it addresses?
I was fortunate to be able to help move forward after the measure passed back in
1998 we had about 10 years that ran and actually showed how the medical marijuana program was working how efficient it was and how it
Was actually helping patients to actually get the relief they want
Knowing that and knowing that the citizens actually passed
That measure which was if I'm not mistaken was
about measure 67
back in 1998
What we basically have seen is that it is actually worked to the point of where we wanted to give the patients in Oregon more
Control more assurance and protection so in 2009
I was able to get my colleagues to actually support
Changing the scheduling of marijuana from the schedule one which is
Identified as having no medicinal purposes to a schedule two and so we are one of them
We're the only city that I know that has actually taken the step to actually
Recognize what the people of this state have said that we believe it doesn't have a medicinal purposes and use and it should be
Clarified and classified to be a schedule two drug
And so that is something that for me is very important and clearly as long as the federal government is
To say behind and coming up where the people of this state and 20 other states in the District of Columbia are at as it
pertains to medical marijuana
Until they make the change from a schedule one to schedule two we have to do everything we can to protect our patients in
this state
We've addressed this a little bit, maybe you could expand on what impact this legalization might have on the black market
Well my goal is to put it out of business
I mean the reality is we have an opportunity to
Have it an industry become more legitimate and out from underneath the rocks and from behind
closed doors and
Alleyways and everything else to the point of where you can actually have a viable industry that's actually going to be producing
Revenue that can go into the state general fund to pay for education
human resource issues health and wellness as well as for public safety needs and
So I do in fact think that you're going to see
the
say the turning away and the drying up of the
Black market as it stands today, and that you will in fact and many of the people I represent in the district I represent
Are looking forward of coming?
out and being more public and being able to
actually be accountable for what they do and not be behind the scenes and being concerned as to
who might be knocking on the doors be it law enforcement or the bad guys trying to get in and
Take what they're doing right now, and this is something that spans beyond urban areas
I
represent a lot of rural areas of Douglas and Lane counties and I can tell you that there are a lot of people who have
Spoken to me about this topic
And they think that this is something that's right for the state and it will make us all better for it
And we'll have the accountability and the responsibilities will be in place
And then we are actually will see revenue coming forward that will help us as a state
