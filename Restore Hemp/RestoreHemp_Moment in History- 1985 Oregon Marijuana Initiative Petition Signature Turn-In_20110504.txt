Turn it sideways.
Yeah.
Next.
Come in here.
Take them out of the front.
Where do you want to stack them?
Right here on the counter.
I like that mothball smell too.
It keeps the little bacterias out of there.
I never could tell.
Hi, Dad.
It's a little bit...
It can't all fit in here anymore, though.
Narrowed it down.
Okay.
Yeah, it keeps coming back.
Why so mad about what he needs?
We want to make sure that the Marijuana Initiative
makes it on the ballot this year
so we can collect the...
what is it?
25,000 to 27,000 extra signatures.
We're turning them in early
to take advantage of this law,
to allow for early verification
so that if there is a shortfall,
we can go out and collect more signatures.
But I'm confident that we have enough signatures
to qualify for the 86th ballot this time.
How much did it cost?
I think we spent about $30,000 to collect the signatures.
You can ask our treasurer here for that question.
Now that it looks like you might get it on the ballot,
how do you think people will vote
and get this message coming out that way?
I think it's going to be a hotly contested election,
and I think we will win.
Yeah!
We're turning them in early
to make sure that the measure appears on the 86th ballot.
We don't want to have the kind of problem we had last year.
We're taking advantage of a new law
that allows for early verification of signatures,
and if there's a shortfall,
we'll simply go out and collect more signatures.
There's plenty more people that will sign the Marijuana Initiative.
Briefly describe what the measure would do for us.
The measure would legalize
personal, private use of marijuana for adults.
What this means is that sale of any amount of marijuana
would be illegal.
Use of marijuana in public would be illegal.
Driving under the influence would be illegal.
Use by minors would be illegal.
Simply to allow adults to grow and possess marijuana.
John, how would you enforce the sale?
If you can grow it in your home,
how are you going to stop people from selling it?
The police will stop people from selling marijuana
just like they do now.
They'll arrest them and convict them
and put them in jail.
How many times have you tried to get this on the ballot?
This is the third time we've tried to get it on the ballot.
How much is it?
It's $1,000.
How much is it?
It's $1,400.
Under the current law or under this proposal?
Currently, possession of
currently, possession of less than an ounce
is a violation.
Possession of anything else is a Class B misdemeanor.
Under our law,
you can possess any amount as long as it's for personal use.
As soon as you sell any amount,
it becomes a crime.
How many people did you have
collecting signatures?
About a thousand different people circulated the petitions.
How much did it cost
to get the signatures?
I think around $30,000 altogether.
How many of those thousands were paid?
How many of that was paid circulators?
How many of those thousands of signatures were paid?
Probably about two-thirds
was paid petitioners
and one-third was volunteer
or perhaps half and half.
Anywhere from
25 to 50 cents per signature.
Valid signatures?
We paid only for valid signatures.
We ran our own verification
on all paid petitioners
and paid them only for those signatures which were valid.
How many valid signatures do you think you have?
More than 62,521.
The signature gathering campaign,
we've sampled over 10,000 signatures.
We're very confident
that this is enough to qualify.
How many of those 10,000
did you find were valid?
I don't have a precise figure
but it was around 20%
of the ballot.
62,000 statutory measures?
Right.
Do you think the chances
from what you can see
are better this time
of winning a spot on the ballot?
It's very hard for me to say.
I don't really want to get into that kind of guessing game
because if it does
then someone might say that I predetermined
and if it does not, then again
I can say question I can't win.
I will say this,
that with this early
of a time in the ability
for us to verify
thereby having a longer time
to put more signatures together
and file to add to this group
it's very unlikely for them not to make
the ballot even if they
in this first quarter round
may not have enough signatures.
In the history of people
dropping off their initiative
petitions, what is the usual
time frame and how does this stand in comparison?
Well typically the Constitution
limits us to 15 calendar days
from the deadline for turning in
and with rare exception of
maybe only a few days, everyone turns
in their initiative measure
right at that deadline.
We may have as many as a dozen
petitions to do all the verification
of signatures within a 15 calendar
day period so there is absolutely no time to add
anything to that. This is the very
first one, petition that is
that we've gotten so early that we're able
to do a verification thereby
affording petitioners the opportunity to
obtain more signatures should there not
be a sufficient number the first time around.
Okay?
Will that make it ballot issue
number one? No.
No, right now it would be
measure number five.
There are four
measures referred to the legislature by
the assembly and those will be to have
the first four numbers.

Come on.
Go ahead.

Between them gathered about 10,000 signatures.

Upstairs today we just
submitted 87,000 signatures
on the Oregon Marijuana Initiative
to Secretary of State Barbara Roberts.
We're confident
that this will be enough signatures to qualify
for the November 1986 ballot.
We've been much more careful than
last year in collecting our signatures.
There are actually several thousand
signatures that we didn't turn in because we
didn't think that they were good enough.
We also did our own
ongoing verification process
throughout the signature gathering campaign.
Altogether we verified
over 10,000 signatures
and we're very confident
that we have more than the
62,521 required by law.
Applause
Here we are
today at the State Capitol Building.
We just handed in 87,660
signatures
and this is Greg Mahalik who is
one of the people who started
OMI. He's our treasurer
and was one of the three chief petitioners
the first time around
and I'm going to ask Greg a couple of questions right here.
First of all, how does it feel
to be handing him in and knowing
that we're on? It feels wonderful to be done with
our third campaign. I'm very happy.
True enough. Anything to say
this is an open mic. Just say whatever you feel like saying.
Okay, yeah. To turn him in
the third time I think is the charm.
The last two
campaigns served to tell
Oregonians that this was happening.
This one is going to be the real thing
and the clincher.
We're going to win.
Michael
Rhodes, attorney for OMI.
Why do you want marijuana legal, Michael?
There are a couple of reasons. Number one, as a criminal
defense attorney, I'm very tired
of trying to defend people,
keep people out of jail for marijuana crimes.
Number two, it seems to me
that as a matter of policy
and as a matter of philosophy
it ought to be no business of the government
what people do in the privacy of their own homes.
It seems to me that
marijuana prohibition has worked no better than
alcohol prohibition in the 20s
and it's a horrendous waste of time
and a tremendous intrusion on
the rights of people's privacy. That's why
I think marijuana ought to be legalized.
We're going to be asking
Fred why he wants
marijuana legal. Golly,
I still see it as a freedom issue
and I don't see it as a marijuana issue.
I'd like to see freedom legal in this country.
I think this is another step on the road
to legalizing freedom.
I see in our society today
in what we are doing politically,
I see a very clear
confrontation
if that's the right phrase,
a very clear meeting
between the government
and the people
and the people
and the people
and the people
and a very clear meeting
between
those people who
believe in live and let live
and those
people who believe in
control. Those people
who believe that we should all think the same
things at the same time
and that the things that we think
are the things that they think.
And
I guess
I feel in my bones
in my being
that I've always been involved
in this fight just as perhaps I've always been
a peasant.
And we're trying
to get rid of the king and
live
each of us our own king.
And that's why
I want to see marijuana legal. I'd like
to go on and legalize
privacy and
the private acts of consenting adults
and then I'd like to see the
collective will restricted to
protecting us from robbers, murderers, rapists
and thieves. And I'd like
to see violence and
lie and made illegal and darn near
and very
little of anything else.
That's
where I'm at.
Oh Mr. Doug
come on over here. Will you look
to camera and explain to the people why you
want marijuana legal?
Because I don't think I've ever been a criminal
except for the one time the police arrested me for petitioning.
Outside of that, just kind of always
made sense
or sense.
And we're looking for
a Michael Becker here.
Come on over here.
Would you explain to the camera
why you would want marijuana legal?
Well I think that
as a member of the financial community
it makes great economic sense to legalize
marijuana. I think that the money currently
being spent in effectively
and inefficiently to enforce against
marijuana represents
pretty much money down the tubes.
In addition,
I believe Oregonians spend somewhere in the neighborhood
of a billion dollars a year.
Somewhere in that vicinity it's probably at least
500 million and possibly a billion.
These people would be spending that money on the legitimate
economy, right? Right. Well I see that
money essentially being filtered into
a black or grey
economy. Money that can be
directly used to benefit
social programs or any other programs
the state might choose to use that
money for.
I hope to be involved.
Is there any that you know
of interest in the lumber industry
recognizing that hemp is an
alternative to cutting down trees
for paper products and the other
industrial agricultural uses?
Well I know historically
hemp has been a very valuable
product
in many respects. In many
capacities it has been used. I'm not quite
certain. I have not gauged the support in the
lumber industry for a product
of that nature.
It seems like
the information I have is that in Europe
uses hemp and that it only takes
about 10% of the capital investment of
a paper plant to convert from
pine trees to hemp.
What do you think would be necessary to make
Weyerhaeuser and these people aware of the alternative
of hemp as compared to cutting
old growth for making plywood?
Well of course they would have to
be convinced that it was economically
feasible and I'm afraid that
currently with a
large proportion of
those involved in the lumber industry currently out of
work, trying to convince
them to do anything
would be particularly difficult. They are
not known as being the most
innovative of industries
and
that is a question
I'm sure that will have to be
at least gauged
after the fact.
Yeah we plan on dealing
with the industrial agricultural uses of
hemp much more so in the future
than we have in the past. We've had to stick
to the issues that will be addressed to us
in order to get on the ballot.
Now we can branch out more into other
aspects of the issue and the information
that we have is that there's about 30,000
different products that can be made out of marijuana.
Any more
words? Well
woo-ha! I just have a couple
of free-form thoughts here.
There's 90 legislators
that sit down in this building every
couple of years and
they're supposed to be the representatives
of the people of Oregon and I don't think
there's a half a dozen of those 90 that
would be in favor of OMI
but one third of the people that
are represented among those 90 use
marijuana. We have
a situation that's very
similar to what happened at the sales tax.
Those same 90 people spent
two entire legislative sessions
trying to put forward a
sales tax that went down 4 to 1.
How could these representatives
have
totally misjudged the feeling
of the people in Oregon?
We have the same situation with the marijuana
issue. We know that this unholy
90 as I call them,
they do not represent the people
in many issues and the
marijuana issue is just another example.
I don't see the marijuana issue passing
4 and 5 to 1 like the sales tax
failed but I see it going
50% plus one vote and that's all we need.
Lynn Funk,
why do you want marijuana legal?
Keep Oregon green. See Lynn.
I think it's
important to have marijuana legal because I think it's a
matter of choice and the
freedom to choose whatever you want to do in your own
home. Plus it's an infringement of your
civil liberties to have the cops come in
and raid your house and go through your house for
growing a plant.
I think that
it's an important step in the
government infringing on other civil liberties.
The fact that they can come in and search
without warrants, that they can
bust you and take your property away when
they wouldn't take property from murderers
or rapists or child
abusers. That there seems to be
an unequal
emphasis on a certain subculture
in our community that
some of the establishment doesn't
seem to like and this is their way to get at them.
Now this is
Louie, he's the signature champ of this
campaign.
Look at the camera and tell the world why you want marijuana
legal.
Well too many of my friends have gone to jail
for doing something which they're not criminals
about.
And
I believe that the marijuana issue is
just a smokescreen of the
divisive issue which is intended to keep
people paranoid and under the control
of the police in this country.
And I think that it's time for
our country to be unified and pulled together
instead of having divisive issues that are like marijuana.
And this is why
I think that marijuana should be legal.
I think there are millions of Americans who'd like
to feel like they're full time Americans and not just
hiding behind some door.
That's all.
And Mr. Sajo, why do
you want marijuana legal?
First off, our proposal is a very
cautious, moderate approach to the
marijuana issue. It only
legalizes possession
in private for adults. Sale of
any amount of marijuana will remain illegal.
Use of marijuana in public will remain illegal.
Use of marijuana by minors will
remain illegal. And driving under the influence
of marijuana will remain illegal.
America was founded
on the principle of freedom. Our personal
liberty is important in this country.
Adults should be free to make choices
about what they do with their own lives.
We must uphold these principles.
Marijuana prohibition is a complete,
utter, total,
unmitigated failure. For 50 years
we've had harsh marijuana laws and that
has not stopped millions of Americans from
smoking marijuana. It's time to
take a look at that policy and try something
different. The laws
hurt us. They cause more problems
than they solve.
Thousands of people are arrested. Our courts
are clogged. We spend millions of dollars
on this law enforcement and it doesn't stop
people from smoking marijuana.
The marijuana
laws alienate thousands of people from police.
We have
real serious crime problems in our country.
Murder, rape, robbery,
burglary. We all need to work
together to solve these problems.
Another
reason to legalize marijuana is because the
marijuana laws are hurting us economically.
Right here in Oregon,
marijuana smokers are spending about a billion
dollars a year to buy marijuana.
If marijuana were
legalized, the price would be way down.
People could grow their own at home and they'd have this
billion dollars to spend on legitimate goods
and services. Oregon could enter an
economic boom when we legalize marijuana.
Another
reason to legalize marijuana
is because the laws do not
do anything to solve the problems that
exist with marijuana. If someone has a problem
with marijuana, we shouldn't throw them in jail.
We should help them.
We'd like to at least see the issue discussed.
We'd like to have Oregonians
have the chance to vote on it.
That's what the Oregon Marijuana Initiative will do.
