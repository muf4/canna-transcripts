I wanna tell y'all a little bit about a plant I know that can save the world
It grows long and tall and has flowers that can make your mind swirl
It's a funky plant with a fiber that is resistant to rain and mold
It's the strongest plant fiber known to man, the best rope you'll ever hold
Well the pioneers covered up the wagon trains with a canvas made of hemp
And Washington and Jefferson, they glued on their fronts and said they'd make the most of it
The first stars and stripes were sewn on him, the first constitution too
It's used around the world for food, fiber, oil, medicine and fuel
And if we're blessed with seeds we won't have no need for any other oil
We can make pantomimes or run our cars going back to next season
It'll fix the soil that rubs us just to see
We can put in our mouth with omega-6 and 3
We can feed the world with the tree of life and live sustainably
But if we cut down all the trees, we won't have nowhere to breathe
We'll grow fields of hemp instead
We can make our papers or build a house from it
We've got to stay grown, wild and free
Living the way that we ought to be
Gonna leave my children a better world than my ancestors left me
Whoa, whoa
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Well the flowers of the female hemp plant make the best medicines on earth
Helps cancer and AIDS patients eat their food
Helps those with depression overcome the blues
For coma, epilepsy, nausea, insomnia, stress, neurosis, psychosis, pink PMS
All the studies have been done and all the doctors agree
But they can't make money off this plant you see
Cause it's free, it grows from a seed
A wild and free life we ought to be
And all the future is grown in our own backyards
But it's weeded up down on the trees
We won't have nowhere to breathe
We'll grow fields of hemp instead
We can make our papers or build a house from it
We've got to stay grown, wild and free
Living the way that we ought to be
Gonna leave my children a better world than my ancestors left me
Whoa, whoa
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Whoa, whoa
So in this modern day and age when we seem to lack spirituality
This one single plant can bring us back ten thousand years in history
To the Shiva, Puranas, the Jesus, the Christ, to the Buddha, the pagans, the goddess, the light
To commune with all the animals, be one with all the trees
To realize that God is equals inside me
As the earth is a mother we've got to take care of the earth
The earth is the mother that gives life birth
And we can be honest with a single green plant
We can start right now
We can start right now
It'll take us down all the trees
We won't have nowhere to breathe
We'll grow fields of hemp instead
We can make our papers or build a house from it
We've got to stay grown, wild and free
Living the way that we ought to be
Gonna leave my children a better world than my ancestors left me
Whoa, whoa
La la la la la la la la la
Whoa, whoa
