Now this is the whole reason marijuana is illegal.
Yep.
This is hemp seed oil with a hemp wick.
And it is an illuminant.
Hemp was an original illuminant before they used whale oil,
before they were using petroleum.
Hemp seed oil was one of the first illuminants
used by humanity to light the first lamps.
And this is the whole reason it's illegal,
because you can pour this hemp oil right
into any diesel engine, turn the key, and drive it.
Hemp oil produces three times more seed oil
than any other plant on the planet.
It also produces three times more fiber.
And here's some hemp twine.
This is produced in China, hemp twine from China.
So the main reason marijuana is illegal
is because of hemp oil and hemp fiber.
And marijuana laws were created to stop the oil companies
from competing with hemp fiber, with the introduction
of new machinery that made hemp fuel and fiber much less
expensive to process, much as the cotton gin
had made cotton much cheaper to process 100 years before.
This new machinery, the decorticator,
had made hemp fiber much cheaper.
So the fuel and fiber companies put together a misinformation
campaign we know as Reefer Madness
and came up with this name marijuana based on racist lies,
as the name marijuana proves.
It's based on anti-Hispanic and people of color
racist propaganda that was prevalent in the 20s and 30s.
And so here is the whole reason that marijuana is illegal.
It has nothing to do with drugs.
Drugs are a smoke screen.
It's really about fuel and fiber.
Exactly.
And there's a very, we're going to do this every week, folks.
I just love the hemp candle idea.
So this is our flame of freedom that we're
going to be talking about each and every show.
