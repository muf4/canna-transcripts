I first came here in 1994, I believe, and I brought this board, which is the first modern hemp board that was made of MDF,
that was made at Washington State University's labs in 1992.
So literally, we brought through the first real modern product at the highest level of credibility way back then.
And Washington, the state of Washington has been involved ever since as far as I'm concerned.
Now, the truth of it is, like you say, we still can't grow it here, but I will also say that while I was doing this work,
the first experimental contract was given to the first Canadian farmer to grow hemp.
There was a proviso in the contract, and it allegedly said that they had to take the actual raw stock and make a finished production prototype out of it.
The story I'm told is that 20 guys signed up. All I know is the stocks I arranged to have the stocks sent to our lab in Washington State.
We created a board with their stocks. We sent it back to them.
And when the farmer put that board in the hand of the Canadian government representative, hemp became legal in Canada.
So Washington is directly involved, Washington State, in the legalization of hemp in Canada.
And supposedly that's how it happened.
Now, I did this all because I wanted to make a product that would show to the whole population what hemp could do
and what we could do in the area of building materials and to save our forests.
The problem is that this takes domestic growing.
This takes where we want to put the factory right in the middle of the field. We don't have that yet.
