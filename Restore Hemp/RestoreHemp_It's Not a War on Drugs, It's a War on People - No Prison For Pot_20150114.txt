When I'm watching the Super Bowl and I see that they're saying people like me are, in
addition to mowing the lawn and having some nachos, also murdered a family in Columbia,
I take offense to that.
Who else takes offense to that?
I did not murder a family in Columbia and it is the people that are propagating this
that are responsible and they're going to keep on, I can't even imagine how many families
are going to die because of our drug war in Columbia.
War on drugs!
Give me a break man!
Attention drug war generals out there!
We are fighting back man.
And unlike you, unlike you drug war generals, we are non-violent, we are peaceful.
You cannot and will not stop us because we are not criminals.
We are Americans and we're going to make that mean something and we're about to take our
take our country back and put it in the hands of the people who founded this country.
The hands of the people whose blood and sweat and tears and backs paved the way for us to
be here today.
The problem is that in our justice system, we've got too much emphasis on the system
and not enough emphasis on the justice.
And I ain't gonna make it, man.
That's exactly why we're here today in Seattle, Memphis.
That's why you came out.
And we'll be vocal day after day after day, year after year after year until we've overcome
and justice finally prevails.
