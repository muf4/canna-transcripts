It's about on the street, I can get on out of town
But this here town's my home, ain't heard of it no one
So leave my house alone, cause it's a losing battle
Now that the truth is out, even the politicians
Have figured this thing out, you can go ahead and impel threats
Might help you loosen your tie, and legalize the herb
And drop all the lies, cause it's a losing battle
Wake up!
Freedom, they'll put us to the test
So it's time to exercise our rights and put on a hip fest
And we'll educate the youth, who soon will rule the land
Cause it's just a matter of time, and it's time to take a stand
Cause it's a losing battle, what nobody can win
Been going on for years, just keeps right on going
Like a cold war with the comics, prohibition and the like
You can throw us all in prison, but you cannot win the fight
Cause it's a losing battle
