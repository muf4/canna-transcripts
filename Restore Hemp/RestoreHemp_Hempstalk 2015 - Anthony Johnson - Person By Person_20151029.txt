All right, thank you so much and guy. Oh, it's great to be here at hemp stock
I
Appreciate the warm welcome and introduction
I'm just happy to have played my part to help legalize and regulate marijuana
here in Oregon
But let's give it up for to Paul Stanford one of the giants of the movement. You know I like to say
That all the activists who are working today
We all stand on the shoulders of Giants and Paul Stanford is one of those Giants
so I really appreciate all the work he's had to do and
You know I got involved in
activism because I saw my African American friends treated more harshly than my white friends for marijuana offenses back in Missouri and
The first time we got a decriminalization measure on the ballot because we couldn't stand to see young students have their lives ruined for marijuana
Within the city limits of Columbia, Missouri
We lost we only got 43 percent of the vote
But then we got right back on the ballot again, and we got more than 60 percent of the vote the next time
we made the ballot decriminalizing marijuana in the city limits of Columbia, Missouri and
Legalizing medicinal use for any patient so the patient finds themselves in Columbia, Missouri
They can possess up to 35 grams of medicinal cannabis legally and
Now that movement in Missouri is looking as move has moved on to decriminalize marijuana in st.
Louis decriminalize marijuana Kansas City is now looking to pass a statewide
Medical marijuana legalization measure in 2016 and I think
This movement of just step-by-step
Person by person city by city state by state is how we're going to legalize marijuana fully you know here in Oregon
we had to
Decriminalize marijuana all the way back in
1973 the very first state to decriminalize marijuana, and then we have to wait until
1998 to legalize medicinal cannabis and then in
2004 we tried to legalize medical marijuana dispensaries it didn't pass
2010 we try to legalize medical marijuana dispensaries again
It didn't pass and then the legislature legalized medical marijuana dispensaries in
2013 you know and in 2012
Paul and measure 80 campaign team got a legalization measure on the ballot that would have legalized you know possession
For adults cultivation for adults it got 47 percent of the vote
You know and it didn't pass
But it laid the foundation for measure 91 each step of the way
We get closer and closer to true equality and true freedom and then after we pass measure 91
We say we're not done there. You know we're going to further decriminalize marijuana
We're going to further reduce marijuana penalties
And we passed the first in the nation expungement provision that can help up to 78,000 people get marijuana
offenses off their record
But now that we've accomplished that we're still not done. You know we got true equality for employment
true equality for housing
Education to have adult smoking sections at a festival where they celebrate alcohol numerous times a year
And we're going to do that
Not because of me not because of Paul not because of any other activists you may hear about
We do that because of people like you all right
Step by step person by person you share your stories about marijuana how marijuana helps you medicinally how it helps you relax
How it's a better choice for you than alcohol or how it works well for you and alcohol
But you're not a bad person you do not deserve to be in prison
You do not deserve to be arrested and you deserve to have employment opportunities
Just like everybody else so person by person speak the truth about cannabis and the truth shall eventually set us free
So thank you very much everybody keep up the good work. I really appreciate it
I appreciate the time to be here, and I look forward to him stock being bigger and better
years
