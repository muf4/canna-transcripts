Hi there, I hope that you have already filled out your ballots and if not, if you're at
it please don't forget 91 really needs your help.
We need to send a message to Washington that this prohibition is unaffordable at all levels,
a trillion dollars on a war against our own people, a constitution that gets trashed when
anybody comes through your private front door dressed in gear as if you're the enemy somewhere
else.
This cannabis has never killed anyone and you need to legalize it for once and for all.
Adults over 21 need to be free to choose it.
Thank you.
