all of the groups and the thing to do if you want to get involved is to get involved.
Because you know those of us who stand up, those of us who are willing to talk truth
to power, those of us who go to legislature and say I'm not a medical marijuana patient
but sometimes I use cannabis to enhance various experiences, sensory experiences.
Those of us who are willing to do that can't do that alone.
And if there's one thing that's true about our movement today it's that there's too many
chiefs and not enough grassroots.
So please, doesn't matter which group you get involved with as far as I'm concerned,
there's a row of non-profits over here behind the stage, stop by, check it out, get involved.
