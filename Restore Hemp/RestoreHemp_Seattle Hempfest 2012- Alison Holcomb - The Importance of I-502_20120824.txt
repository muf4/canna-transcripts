There are Mexican fathers, poets, laureates that are prying over the fact that 55,000 people have
died in Mexico in the past six years. 55,000 people have died as a result of the drug war there
that is as a result of the war on drugs here. 55,000 people is more than the entire population
of the city of Redmond across Lake Washington from us. There are proud black mothers in this
country who are enraged. It is their sons and their brothers and their fathers that are getting
hauled off to jail and saddled with criminal convictions while they watch their white pot
smoking friends go free. There are presidents in Latin American countries. There are prime
ministers in European nations. All of them watching us and all of them will be looking
at their newspapers on November 7th to see what the headlines read. Now a headline is a very simple
statement. A headline doesn't get into the details about why somebody voted the way that they did.
The headlines around the world on November 7th are going to read either Washington legalizes
marijuana or marijuana legalization defeated again.
How are you going to vote? How are those headlines going to read? I ask you for yourself,
for the state of Washington, for the entire world, please vote yes on initiative 502
and next year this is going to be an even bigger party. Thank you so much.
