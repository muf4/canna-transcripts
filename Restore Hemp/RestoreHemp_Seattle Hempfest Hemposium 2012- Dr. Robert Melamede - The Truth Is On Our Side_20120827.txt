The more people that get to use the medicine, the more people will not only be healing their
physical ailments, but the mental ailments that come from not having enough cannabinoid
activity, either because you're just genetically a little weak on it, or you're not eating
the right foods, or you're not using cannabis.
So what I think is that the more and more people use it, the less they're going to be
able to cling.
And the federal government is not going to go down easy.
And they're going to do everything they can at every step of the way to maintain some
element of control.
However, we all know that the truth and reality is on our side, so that it'll be a progressive
weakening of the stupidity that they continuously enforce as we build the strength of knowledge
and truth.
And I can tell you, one of the roads we're going down now with cannabis science has to
do with HIV.
And without going into details, because we haven't released things, I'm not allowed to
say things that are not properly press released.
But in general, the reality is that there's somewhere between 35 and 50 million people
in the world today with HIV.
And that number is so dramatic that it's going to cause not only the collapse of communities,
but of countries and potentially the African continent in terms of economy.
The United States does not want that to happen.
You cannot produce enough antiretroviral drugs for 50 million people.
It's not possible because of the complexity.
But we can make cannabis products to satisfy that size of a population need.
And you have 50 million people learning the truth, in that sense, it's irrevocable.
The government's position will collapse over time, and we're doing everything we can to
make that happen sooner than later.
