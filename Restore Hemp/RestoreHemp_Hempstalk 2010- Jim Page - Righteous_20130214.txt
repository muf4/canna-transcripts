Yeah, Hempstock, good to be here.
I played that Seattle Hemp Fest for years and years.
Started out as a little place up there in Starlight Mountain.
Smaller than this even, way up there in the Cascades, you know.
You're getting cold this time of night.
You'd be hunkering down in your sleeping bag in your tent,
taking a little nip of something to keep warm.
Song from back in those days.
Here's a little song that you might get along with.
All about a natural seed, growing wild by the side of the roadway.
It's nature's a wonderful weed, been around so long.
It's hard to tell why any woman think it's new.
Love it or hate it, however you relate it, I'll leave that up to you.
But isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough for me.
Now history's locked in a cardboard box and it's hard to take a look.
With sidetracked frills and fantasies all written all over the book.
Everybody tells you what to think and they've got their reasons why.
You gotta pick reality up by the scruff of the neck and look it right in the eye.
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough for me.
Now the same people that are spreading the fear, the same people that scare me the most.
You know, some of them look like they just assumed like to hang from a lamp post.
They talk about what it does to your brain.
Well, I just have to react, cause Hitler never touched the stuff and that's an actual fact.
And isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough for me.
Now George Washington was the father of our country and he had a hemp plantation.
Betsy Ross used it to make the flag that flew above the baby nation.
They wrote their declarations on paper from that same hemp fiber press.
And I don't know what they smoked when they were taking a break, but I got a pretty good guess.
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough for me.
Now it'll calm you down when you're too uptight. You know, it just might make you smile.
Use the seed oil in your engine. It'll lubricate the miles.
Glaucoma and chemotherapy, they say it smooths out the track.
So next time you meet a cancer patient, ask them what they think about that.
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough for me.
I don't know why some people get so upset when you say to legalize it.
They'd rather build more jails, arrest more people, and spread more crazy lies.
It's like talking to a brick wall. You know, they just don't get the facts.
I think they ought to try a little of that Betsy Ross. It just might help them relax.
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough for me.
Now this is just a song about a plea for common sense. You know what I'm saying?
Just a little common sense, a little bit of slow down on a pick them up and throw them away and lock the door kind of thing.
You know what I'm talking about?
So I guess I've just about had my say now, so I get beyond my way.
I know some people don't like the kind of things I've got to say.
But I got mine and you got yours. We give what we can take.
So next time I need a breather, well I might just take a little smoke break.
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Ain't that the way it ought to be?
Isn't that righteous? Isn't that good enough?
Righteous is good enough, yes. Righteous is good enough.
Righteous is good enough for me.
Thank you.
