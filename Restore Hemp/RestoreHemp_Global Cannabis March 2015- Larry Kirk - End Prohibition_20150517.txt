And what he didn't tell you is for the last nine months I've been a cancer
survivor guys. So if anybody tells you that Rick Simpson oil don't work look
you're looking at it guys. They told me I was going to go away in September. I'm
still here. I plan on being here for some time coming so as long as I keep getting
Rick Simpson oil I'll be around guys. But I'm really here to talk about the
Cannabis Common Sense Tour. We did a great job on the West Coast tour of it
and we're gonna be taking off on the East Coast coming this summer. So keep a
lookout for it man. If you don't know anything about it it's a way that we put
money on the books of marijuana activists that are in jail for marijuana
crimes. So it's a great tour. It's going to be a great cause. Come out and get
behind it guys.
