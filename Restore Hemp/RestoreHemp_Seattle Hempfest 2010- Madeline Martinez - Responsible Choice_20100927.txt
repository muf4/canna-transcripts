Hi everybody, I'm Madeline Martinez. I'm the executive director of the Oregon
affiliate to National Normal. I'm on the board of Normal and I'm also the owner
and founder of the world-famous Cannabis Cafe. I don't know if you've heard about
it but it got a lot of news coverage which was really exciting but in our
state we have a new progressive measure on the ballot and it's measure 74 and
John Stajo back there I just want to congratulate you for getting there on
the ballot John you worked hard yeah. It's a regulated supply system for medical
marijuana patients and medical marijuana what a beautiful thing that's how I
became an activist because I somebody told me no at Kaiser they said no you
can't have medical marijuana because you don't have glaucoma cancer or AIDS well
I don't take no for an answer very well I'm a product of the 60s the turbulent
60s a child of Dr. King and I don't take no for an answer I'm one of those fiery
Latinas that says oh what do you mean now so anyway Kaiser ended up giving me
one of their first letters saying that it was okay for me to use medical
marijuana and I have been there since the implementation of the Oregon
Medical Marijuana Act fighting in one way or another to make sure that
patients rights were not stepped on trampled on and we've actually be been
able to get 24 ounces of stored marijuana we started out with three
which was laughable because how do you control a plant with three you know make
sure that you only have three ounces well we fought every step of the way we
finally got in 2007 24 ounces of usable marijuana which was a huge success for
all of us believe me it was amazing to be able to have that much at the
legislature we sat down and we spoke with law enforcement they had been after
the affirmative defense for years and they were going to come and take it and
give us nothing in return and regulate it to the point where there was only one
growth for per residents so that wasn't going to happen but you know I found
that legislature legislators are actually really nice people if you sit
down and talk to them they have stories as well so please I always tell people
you got to get involved like Douglas and Brian and everyone else you got to get
down there and you got to let them know who you are and we teach you know
patients and other members of normal how to use those tools effectively how to
make sure that they go and they make contact with these people of course like
everyone else my dream is legalization and boy I really am excited Douglas
about your language and I'd like to see if we can do it in Oregon with you
because I think it's gonna take the whole country yeah we're gonna have to
unite and get this taken care of because although medical marijuana is a
beautiful thing in my state people are losing their jobs every day because of a
dirty way I mean it's just not acceptable they're losing their children
their children are being taken away from them in dirty custody battles where
someone says you use medical marijuana I mean I can't even tell you if someone
tried to take my child for me I would not be able to breathe and so to think
that someone can take your child from you even though you've applied for the
protections afforded to you is just not acceptable anymore that's why I say it's
time for us to all stand up put the joint down step away from your bond
just for a little while I mean I've been smoking since I was 16 and I'm not gonna
put it down I'm gonna smoke until the day that I die I'm looking for somebody
to hook me up with one of those oxygen things so I can just vaporize through
the little nostril part you know when I get too old but no I'm getting and I
think it's important for all of us you know Douglas was just talking about hemp
and I watched Jack Harris Emperor of hemp may he rest in peace and I actually
tattooed it on my arm I always I always wanted a big tattoo and I've got time
Ma the first character for him Ma on my arm and and that man was a hero to me
and he made me the hemp activist I am today because America's roots are hemp
roots our financial our foundation our economy actually used hemp in it and why
aren't we using why aren't we going back to those roots I hear people constantly
touting oh our founders our phone our founders were hemp farmers because they
were smart enough just like birds to eat the hemp seed you know when you think
about it birds are more intelligent than our
Congress people then our own government they'll eat those hemp seeds first and
we need to make that clear to our to our Congress we need to make that clear to
President Obama we have hemp fuel no other Americans should go die for a
foreign fuel we can we can grow it in our country the residue from that fuel
once it's pressed is hemp flower rich in the omegas I mean we all fight for this
and we must continue to move forward in our state we're lucky enough that our
Senator Floyd Prasad he actually passed legislation where hemp is now something
that's acceptable it's the law in the state of Oregon but of course those
pesky feds they're waiting for their approval as always with everything and
that's why I think Douglas's approach to marijuana may I ask you to I'm just
gonna ask this publicly because I've asked other people as an attorney if we
legalize marijuana isn't hemp then legal? In some states yes and in some
states no our initiative removes ambiguity but a lot of states have
measures in place that if the federal government changes its stance on hemp or
on hemp permits that they can go immediately I know Kentucky's one I know
North Dakota's one so there are some states that are ready to go in the way
they've defined the marijuana plant so the other are some states that would be
it would be legal the minute the feds say so. Excellent so I'm gonna stop using
the word regulate now I got a good lesson just like the rest of you no more
regulation we're just gonna legalize that's the new term and I don't know
what we can say because when you say the word legalization it really does
scare a lot of people and when you say the word tax that frightens them
even more they just want to turn around and run away because that it's scary to
think of being taxed again especially in this economic time but I think that
when we look at our economy and if we look at the fact that in the state of
Oregon for us 350,000 Oregonians consume cannabis on a regular basis according to
government statistics so if we look at that as in an economic from an economic
perspective it seems like with medical marijuana patients we're targeting the
wrong population segment of the population we should be targeting that
350 you know thousand people or more and get this get these jobs going we
need green jobs hey they don't get much greener than growing pot I actually went
to one of my legislators and said you know I used to work in a women's prison
and we have all this property in there and I said why don't we use that land
and we have all these wonderful students that know how to grow why don't we grow
marijuana for the patients in the in the prison security's there you know
some people have said I was crazy I'm well maybe I am a little crazy maybe I
am a dreamer you know but I think that we can make it all work with all the
money we spend on the prison system let's get something in return don't you
think I mean why not Jeff Merkley now is one of our Congress people and but he
did he had the conversation with me at least he was open enough to have that
conversation people aren't always trying to get into prison so when and
it's not easy to get out I can tell you for one thing so hey why not but anyway
I am pushing it every way I can to make sure that we let people know that we're
just like myself I'm just a normal mom blazing the Oregon Trail every day
trying to make it work for everybody everybody needs to be recognized as
cannabis consumers not just patients we have veterans with PTSD and they're
they don't qualify in our state and it's a shame when you look at those people
going and risking their lives for us and we cannot even afford a medical marijuana
you know that's what we all fight for the people that can't have it those of
us who are lucky enough should I say degenerative disc and joint disease I
don't know if you want to count that as lucky but I get to have a medical
marijuana card but what about the veterans that don't what about the lady
who lost her children so we must legalize as soon as possible please join
normal
