I'm crazy about you baby
Just don't mean a thing
I'm crazy about you baby
Just don't mean a thing
Cause when I hear you talkin'
Make my head drums ring
I love a little darlin'
When you hold me in your arms
I love a little darlin'
When you hold me in your arms
When it's cold outside
You know you're gonna keep me warm
And that's why I'm crazy about you baby
I'm crazy about you baby
I'm crazy for you darlin'
Crazy for you child
I'm crazy about you baby
But it just don't mean a thing
. . .
