This is what you call ribbon hemp.
We took stems after the trimmers were done,
and under the carve-out exemption from marijuana
that mature stalks and the fiber therefrom are not marijuana,
we took these mature stalks, we soaked them in water overnight,
and then the next day we peeled the bark off of the hemp stalks.
And so this is ribbon hemp.
So it's starting with ribbon hemp, and these are some woolen carters.
Is this what a sheep herder or a sheep processor would use?
No, no, this is all plant fiber.
And so we work the fiber, and this combs the cuticle off of it,
and I am making a bit of a mess.
This is what you cut down within the end, is that correct?
That's right.
Wow. Delightful.
This breaks it apart and takes the cuticle off.
And this is almost as soft as a wool or sheep sweater.
It's actually a little finer than a wool hair, a wool fiber.
This is 18 micron diameter is the real fibers from the hemp.
