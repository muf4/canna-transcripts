In and out of time
When I first saw her I knew
The way she looked at me was like brand new
In her mind was a room with a view
I know she loves me and I ain't no fool
So fine, love will die never
Gonna love her forever
That's how it is when you're in love
Her vibe, it hits you just like a drug
All the things you want to share with her
It's like nothing else matters
So fine, gonna love her forever
In and out of time
Love will die never
Love you so fine
Gonna love you so fine
Love you so fine
