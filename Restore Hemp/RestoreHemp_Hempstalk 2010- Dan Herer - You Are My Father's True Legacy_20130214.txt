Hi, how you doing? My name is Dan Harer and if any of you have lost a loved one, you know that sometimes speaking about them gets a little tough, so bear with me.
My father inspired people. He helped inspire the people that started this event, events in California, helped to change laws, helped to protect people's rights, fought for the wrongful persecution and prosecution of innocent victims of the drug war.
He went from state to state around this country and he taught everybody that he could, spoke to everybody, rich, poor, old, young. Not only did he try to teach them, but he also listened to them, listened to what their fears were, listened to what their hopes would be.
A lot of people say, you know, your father left you a great legacy with his book, with his words, with the people that he inspired. But in all honesty, I think the legacy that he left was what I see in everybody at every one of these events around the states that I've been to.
You are my father's true legacy. It's through his words and hopefully how he's inspired you to show up at these events, participate, create new hemp commerce that will create changes in the future.
Because you are the roads to the future and the bridges that we must create and cross to educate the other side of this movement, and that is the uneducated.
A year ago this weekend, my father stood on this stage and expressed his feelings for the future, that without hemp as our future, we would have no future.
I look out across this field and I see hope. I see hope in the people that he loved and cared for, whether he had ever met them or not.
And you, you are the future of this movement. You are the future of the ways these laws are going to change from state to state.
And I am proud to say that I am his son. I'm even prouder of the legacies that he's created within each and every one of you.
God bless you all. God bless Jack Herb.
Thank you.
