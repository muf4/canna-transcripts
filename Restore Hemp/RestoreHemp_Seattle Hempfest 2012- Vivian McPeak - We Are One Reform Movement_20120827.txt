Give yourselves a hand, you're the greatest audience in the world.
We're one community.
You know, there's this I-502 stuff going on, some people are for it, some people are against
it in the community.
And you know what?
We're not for it.
We're not for it.
We're not for it.
We're not for it.
We're not for it.
We're not for it.
That's not healthy.
That's okay.
We're one reform movement.
When we start dividing ourselves and being angry and calling each other names and insulting
each other because we don't agree on the very fine points, we're defeating ourselves.
We're one union.
We're one reform movement.
We don't always agree on everything, but this is one movement, man.
There's not like a bunch of reform movements, there's only one.
So you know, I-75, or excuse me, I-502 will be historic if it passes.
It'll be historic.
And there's some folks that are against it, and you know what?
They've got a right to their opinion.
And they've got a valid perspective too.
We're one movement.
We're going to have the folks from both camps up here speaking,
because that's what HempFest is about, getting all the voices out there,
showing respect to everybody, treating everybody with dignity and equal respect.
Regardless of what the fine points are, we all agree on the big thing.
We need to change the laws.
So let's be one community, one movement, one reform entity.
