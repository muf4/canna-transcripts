Hey guys, this is LK. I'm here at Seattle Hemp Fest with the man himself, Keith Straub.
Again, thank you for that. The founder of Normal Guys. The world's oldest marijuana smoker.
What do you think of the event? I love the Hemp Fest. I made a special effort to come out again this year.
I wasn't sure I was going to come and I started thinking about it. I think I've
been 14 of the last 15 and it is the world's largest pot festival and it is
fabulous. I mean I love the people. I love the event. I hope never to miss it.
I know that you've been to a few of them. The crowd lasted yesterday. What did you think?
It was crazy. Massive, massive crowds and to think that it's pulled together by
volunteers. If people think you can't still do technical, political organizing
on the local level, I mean, this is, I think their budget is something like a
half a million dollars for this event and it is totally run by volunteers. No
one gets paid a time and it is beautifully organized. So Vivian McPeak
and all the good folks at Hemp Fest, you do great work. You make us proud as stoners.
We really are finally winning this. It's not that we're tricking people. We have a
majority of support in the entire country now that supports legalizing
marijuana. When Normal was founded, Gallup polled just under first question of
legalization and we only enjoyed 12% support in the entire country. So all that
hard work people have done out there has paid off, folks. It won their hearts and minds.
