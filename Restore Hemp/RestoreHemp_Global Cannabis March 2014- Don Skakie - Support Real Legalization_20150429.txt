Write them emails, make phone calls, go into their offices and put a face on medical.
There were legislators that said, oh 90% of the medical people are fakes.
They're just rec users that just want to smoke pot.
Well, I want to tell you something.
I'm also here to speak for patients like William Kurtz, who has a degenerative hereditary disease.
And I got to tell you, 90% of the patients that I know in Washington don't get out.
They can't afford to get out.
They are physically unable to get out.
They are too ill to get out.
So we need to put our face in front of the legislature.
We've got to make sure that they know that medical is legitimate, that recreational is
not harmful.
But the two must go ahead separately to protect the best interests of the state and of the
people and of the patients.
Make sure you're registered to vote.
Sign these initiatives.
And before we get to the vote, start on your legislators.
I'm a voter.
I live in your district.
I voted for you.
You represent me, and medical makes a difference to me and my community.
Tell them what the law should be.
Don't sit around and wait to vote on it.
You are the government.
The government is not you.
Make them change the law to represent what we want for cannabis.
