I was just over at the symposium stage doing a panel with some other canvas activists and
we're just talking about things you can do to become an activist and
Ben from the CDC mentioned that Nora Callahan says that activism is where you are and I think
that's really important. You got to think local and think simple. Keep it simple. This is a big sign
with six words, five words. You know it's simple. You have to find out something inside yourself.
How do I help? And the only way you can do that is by taking first steps. You can't be afraid.
You have to be willing to experiment and I tried making t-shirts and you know I wasn't very good
at first. Practice makes perfect. So try different things. Experiment. Find out what you're good at.
Find something inside yourself that lets you help someone other than yourself. Right now I'm working
with the Cannabis Child Protection Act 514. It would allow adults 21 years of age and older
to grow a 20 by 20 garden. Recreational marijuana. It would also require video proof of impairment
before blood could be used against you in a DUI. We're collecting signatures all over the place.
We're just behind McWilliams stage just down the road a little ways.
We need help. We need volunteers to help us gather signatures. So look for 514.
