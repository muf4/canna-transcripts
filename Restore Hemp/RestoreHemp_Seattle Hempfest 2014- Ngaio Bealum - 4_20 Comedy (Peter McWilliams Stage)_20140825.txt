Remember this, when weed is legal and weed is legal here, it's not just the growers and the sellers who make money.
There's gonna be other businesses. People make t-shirts, people make hats, people make security systems, right?
I'mma open a Bud and Breakfast hotel.
Would you come visit me at the Wake and Bake Inn? Would you come say hello?
Right? Right? Like, good morning! Good afternoon, really.
We, uh, we don't get up that early at the Wake and Bake.
But hey, you're just in time for blunch.
Right? Cause I'm a good cook. I don't have any money. I smoke a lot of weed. I will invent shit to eat. You feel me?
Right? If we got Bisquick and peanut butter, we got peanut butter rolls coming.
In 12 to 14 minutes.
I looked in the pantry one time, we have marshmallows, margarine, and Top Ramen.
I'm making ramen treats.
And they were hella good, too. They were.
Don't use the flavor packet. That'll fuck it up. It's not savory.
I know you guys know what Top Ramen is. Don't even front. Right?
No. Sometimes you get an upscale crowd, they just stare at you and shit like, ramen, brr.
I had to break it down to a crowd one time, I was like, well, y'all know Cup O' Noodles, right?
Well, I can't afford a fucking cup.
I'm just trying to get old noodles. You feel me?
You ever been so broke you went through your couch again?
Some of you know what I'm talking about.
They're gonna legalize weed in Oregon this year.
That's beautiful. I love to buy weed in Oregon, like my friend Dan Gabriel says, because there's no sales tax.
I know y'all got, y'all pay hella sales taxes up here for shit. Right?
It's $10 for a pack of cigarettes, because I smoke the fancy cigarettes, right?
Because I'm killing myself organically.
And it's $10 for a pack. I live up here, that's $300 a month.
I could save that, I could quit smoking, put that money in a jar, and at the end of the month I have $300 and I could go get hookers and crack.
Really just crack. If you have crack, hookers will show up.
And they'll bring cigarettes, because that's really what I want.
Because it's been like a month, and I'm kind of fainting, I'm having a nicotine kick.
Think about the nature of addiction. Just handle your drugs, that's all I ask.
That's all I ask, people. Everybody here is on drugs, I don't give a shit.
You're on drugs, do drugs, I don't care.
Everybody here, you smoked some weed, you had a beer, whatever.
You're on a Xanax or a Valium or a Klonopin, Norco, I don't give a shit.
Just handle your business.
You're running around puking on people and trying to fight girls, you're doing too much.
That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.
Be a grown up about it. We'll give you until you're 25.
By the time you're 25, you should know what drugs, right, in what amount, and what order.
Order is important. It took me forever to learn that I could be stoned to go get drunk,
but I can't be drunk and go get stoned.
Because that's when the...
Holding on to the earth like a nerd, like gravity is real, you guys.
Right, and I'll be out somewhere drunk as hell, and somebody will be like,
let's go smoke this joint. I'll be like, I'm cool.
You're a pussy. No, I'm a professional.
I'm saving you vomit, you should be thanking me.
Sure.
You're welcome.
Right, and I don't care. Do drugs, I don't care. Take a bunch of ecstasy.
I don't give a shit. I'll buy you orange juice.
I'll let you rub my purple shirt and shit. I don't care.
Right, I'll give you the car wash treatment. Lean back, lean back.
That's the shit.
I personally love weed. I do. I love marijuana. I don't care. I love weed.
I love it. I love it. I'll tell you why.
For me, weed is the umami flavor of life.
You understand what I'm talking about? It's the ketchup, it's the soy sauce,
it's the ranch dressing of doing shit.
Right? So shit is cool, you put some weed on it, it's a little bit cooler.
Right? Maybe it's not cool at all. Dip it in some weed, it's alright.
Right? I don't like to wash dishes.
But I don't mind getting high and washing dishes.
You understand? Of course it takes an extra hour.
Because I have to make a playlist first.
So fresh and so clean.
You guys don't listen to music when you wash the dishes?
You just wash the dishes in silence and gravity.
Kind of somber.
Oh, you listen to metal?
Hell yeah. It's the metal stage.
I fucking love metal. I don't care who knows.
I know I don't look the part.
All that crazy Cookie Monster shit, I like it evil too.
I like it super super evil.
I want to put the CD on and worry about my soul.
You understand where I'm coming from? Pantera.
Right? Brujeria. You know what I'm talking about?
Slipknot, Lamb of God. I saw Gwara twice. I saw Hatebreed last year.
Heavy shit. And I go to concerts and I act a fool.
I walk on hands, I'm moshed, I'm in the middle of the pit.
I stage dive like a fiend, but I'm 46 years old.
Right?
So first, I have to get there kind of early.
Because I need to stretch.
What? First thing I'm going to do is smoke all your weed.
You guys don't know what I'm talking about.
You're all young and spry.
Look at this beautiful Seattle weather. If you're from Seattle, please put on some sunscreen
so you don't burst into flame.
We'd like you to keep your gothly pallor.
What time is it?
413. Seven minutes. Is everybody getting ready?
We're about to put up a cloud in this Mickey Dickey.
I love we.
If I was in a gang, this would be my gang sign.
Hey, who you roll with?
Oh, I roll with everybody, dog. I'm not...
I'll twist it up left-handed on a ski lift wearing gloves in a blizzard at night.
You feel me? I'm a natural-born chiller.
Who likes weed? Anybody like weed?
I love marijuana. I'll tell you why.
Weed has medicinal properties.
I know you guys know, but you read shit. You study shit all the time.
Marijuana helps with this. Marijuana fixes that. Marijuana cures this.
They just published a study that weed helps to alleviate
the symptoms and the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
It's true. How it works is
you get so used to forgetting shit,
you develop a system.
Then when the Alzheimer's kicks in, you don't even know.
You just think you're high. That's not a bad way to live.
You do forget shit when you smoke a lot of weed. You really do.
Mostly, I forget where I put my weed. That's really mostly what happens.
I'm not lying. I found hash in my passport one time. That's not a good idea.
Right? Never hide hash in your passport.
That's the first place they look.
No. I'll race you to the consulate.
I don't carry weed internationally.
I carry it domestically. I don't give a shit.
TSA doesn't give a shit either. Don't take a pound and a half.
I got busted one time just a couple years ago
coming out of Spokane. I'm trying to go through
the metal detector that makes me go through the x-ray machine.
They're like, sir, what's that in your pocket?
I was like, that's a pipe and a small amount of medical marijuana.
That's not going to affect the safety of the plane at all.
I was like, my thinking exactly, sir. Good day.
Good day to you.
Two minute warning. Football season's coming.
Go Niners.
Seahawks! Seahawks! Seahawks!
You do sound like donkey's?
Seahawks! Seahawks! Seahawks!
Seahawks! Seahawks! Seahawks!
Seahawks! Seahawks!
Seehawks!
We love them.
With the Seahawks 5, I was just talking shit
because, it's just sports. It's not really fighting.
Let's not really fight.
Right? I don't fight anybody.
I'm funny, I got some weed. We negotiate.
Too hard to fight.
Listen!
HempFest is beautiful.
Make some noise for HempFest, first of all.
Think about it.
Think about all the HempFests. This is the 23rd.
Think about all the other.
There's the Missoula HempFest. There's the Madison HempFest.
There's the Moscow HempFest.
There's the International Hemp and Cannabis Exhibition.
Next month in Portland, we're doing
the International Cannabis Business Conference.
You should look into that shit. It's off the hook.
I'm doing the Cannabis Comedy Festival
in Sacramento in September.
Think about it.
Weed is the only illegal drug
that people throw festivals for.
Right?
Nobody ever goes to MethFest.
Who stole the fucking sound system?
Happy 420, everybody!
Make some noise!
God damn you guys!
