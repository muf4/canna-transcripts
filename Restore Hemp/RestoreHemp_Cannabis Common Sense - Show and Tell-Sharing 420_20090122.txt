Let's start over here with the new nutritious hemp milk, which is very, very tasty.
It comes in plain, vanilla, and chocolate. I don't have any plain here to show.
It's actually distributed from here in Portland, Oregon, but it's made up in Vancouver, British Columbia,
or up in the British Columbia, Vancouver area anyway.
So this is really a tasty, new, very nutritious item out there that has all the Omega-6 and 3
that most of our diets are lacking, so that's something to look at.
Next over, we have a Park Davis bottle.
This is a pint bottle of cannabis tincture, one of the half-dozen Park Davis cannabis.
You can see cannabis right there products.
Then right here is the pride of the THCF medical collection.
This is our oldest medicinal cannabis bottle from the 1840s from London.
Cannabis was introduced into British pharmacology in 1839 by William O'Shaughnessy, a Scotsman.
He brought it back from India, and he called it Cannabis Indica.
Here's one of the early bottles that they used to store it in.
It's a real big bottle. I'd say that holds a gallon or so. It's big.
1840, our oldest bottle.
Next door, we have a 1880 cannabis tincture bottle from here in North America.
They call these things lugs or label under glass because they put the label under the glass
and then put glass on top of it.
That's one of the terms for these type of apothecary bottles, a lug bottle.
It's got a nifty little cap, and you'd see that in your pharmacist.
This one here, the last one that we'll bother you with tonight,
is a reproduction that was done by the British Pharmacological Society in 1972.
