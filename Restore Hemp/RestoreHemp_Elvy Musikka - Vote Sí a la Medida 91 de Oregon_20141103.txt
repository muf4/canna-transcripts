Hello friends, are you ready to vote?
The 91st needs your vote urgently.
We arrested many Latinos and all the blacks we found for marijuana, but we all smoked it.
We have arrested 25 million people since 1980.
This has to end.
This has damaged many lives and it is the worst thing that happens to a family.
They take their parents to jail for something that never killed anyone.
Vote yes!
