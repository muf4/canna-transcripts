During times of shadow, in the background of burst, the sun waits for the moon to torch
the night, torch the night.
In the broken neon and faded light, the lucky motel at the corner of nowhere and the past
where memories go to forget, to forget.
Laughing to erase, her name is Lacey.
She makes us crazy, kinda crazy.
His name is Juan.
She can hear it.
She wants Juan, but doesn't want to.
Sparks of the stars, strong heat.
He is like flame as her fire waits.
She is a pulse, a pulse in the charging light.
Every passion of storm, lightning carries thunder.
She is a good girl, coming to understand that sometimes this is what good girls do.
In the breath of silence, in the magic of moon, they held him together so he could not
feel so alone, so alone, so alone.
During times of shadow, in the background of burst, the sun waits for the moon to torch
the night, torch the night.
In the breath of silence, in the magic of moon, they held him together so he could not
feel so alone, so alone, so alone.
