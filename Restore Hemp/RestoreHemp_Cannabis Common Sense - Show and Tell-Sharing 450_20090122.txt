Sharing session tonight our our show and tell we have several of our museum items from the hemp and cannabis
foundations
Collection of about 200 different medicinal cannabis items, and we always bring out some things like this
This is hemp food that you can pick up on the internet or at health food stores
These are hulled hemp seeds and hulled hemp seeds taste a lot like a cross between cashews and walnuts
And so if you like nuts, then I recommend hulled hemp seeds
They taste really good you can get them in health food stores right next door. We find a cannabis tincture. This is an alcohol
extract from the 1890s from the company Sharpen dome
Sharpen dome was in business up to the 70s
I believe then right next door to that we have two different bottles one from the
1890s another one from 1910 that
Are from Eli Lilly and both of these were different types of tinctures they have different numbers on them
Let's see this is tincture number 96. This is tincture number 17
Whatever that means anyway next door we find from Mulford and company another cannabis tincture
Which is a really nifty thing so we have a whole set of bottles with cannabis tincture, then this is one of my favorites
It's from specific medicines, and this was a bottle of American hemp
They didn't even call it cannabis in this case. It means the same thing folks hemp and cannabis
This is American hemp and what you find in here are a bunch of marijuana flowers. Just like you're you go to the and buy
some flowers in the black market
Back in the day, which is like 1890 to
1920 you could buy these over-the-counter at your pharmacy
American hemp and it has the the wording on the side these bottles is really amazing
We'll have to go over that again someday now. This is a
Cannabis oil extract it's a recent product these are cannabis
Hemp seed oil and hemp seed oil is very nutritious
It has all the good fats that wipe out the bad fats and once you press hemp seeds you get a third
30% oil and what's left over is this stuff hemp flour?
Which is very high in protein and very healthy now the thing about hemp seed oil is it is the most productive?
Seed oil crop and not only is it healthy for you?
But it will run any diesel engine and so if we could run our diesel engines on hemp seed oil
Then we would have such a supply of this hemp flower that it would wipe out world hunger
And I think we're gonna do that in the next 20 or 30 years once we end adult cannabis prohibition
finally from the 1870s or 1880s we have a
Cannabis tincture bottle that you would have found in an old a pocket there a or drugstore way back when
