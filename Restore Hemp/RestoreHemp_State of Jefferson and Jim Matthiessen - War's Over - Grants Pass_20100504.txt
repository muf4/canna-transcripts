It's a little song for the drug war.
The war is over, so let's all get high.
Thousands upon thousands have died and
These words just did not sink in their head.
So many give yet so many more can take
Until the seventh turn of it just I have to make.
War is over, when's everybody gonna learn?
War's over, tell them we're bound to burn.
War's over, unless you're caught up in that line, that same old line.
War's over, so for God's sake let's get high.
So what about it, ain't you heard the story yet?
You're going to have to change it to write to the dead.
I'm getting way too concerned and it ain't no lie.
We all come together soon or we all bound to die.
War's over, don't you be acting dumb.
War's over, cause there ain't nowhere to run.
War's over, unless you're caught up in that line, that same old line.
War's over, so come on let's get high.
