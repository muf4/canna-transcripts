It's so, I mean this is pretty historical, you know, Dave and Danny and Aguadas here,
and I should introduce Aguadas, but I mean the four of us have been at this, we get our
20-year pins in the hemp industry, you know, and we're approaching our 25-year pins in
the hemp industry, and I stay current on cannabis issues and I'm helping cannabis providers
in a general sense in the modern era and the edges that those cannabis providers do.
What else am I doing?
I'm helping the people that are playing with the synthetic cannabinoids here in the industry,
but to me, the HempFest is a real indicator of where we are and how incredible HempFest
has become, the organization here, the people, the core.
You just gave 35 bucks, right on, can anybody match that 35 bucks?
Somebody come on, somebody match this 35 bucks right there.
And a whole pack of cigarettes.
Hey!
Right on, right on.
HempFest has been, is a success because hemp is a success, and whether you know it or not,
just like the East Coast can't see that cannabis is no big deal out West, America can't see
that hemp is no big deal anywhere else in the rest of the world, and it's actually becoming
a big deal because it's becoming big industry, especially in Canada.
And now there's more than 10,000 people directly employed producing hemp products and the plans,
the momentum there is humongous and it's not just hemp foods, it started off with hemp
foods, that was the first thing that made sense.
And now it's building materials, and that's going to make the thing go huge because the
quantities of hemp that are needed to make building materials are farm size, county size
growings of industrial hemp.
It's going to become a commodity that will be traded in car loads and on the futures
market in our lifetimes.
Rather than in back alleys and otherwise.
So I think it's a great positive shift.
