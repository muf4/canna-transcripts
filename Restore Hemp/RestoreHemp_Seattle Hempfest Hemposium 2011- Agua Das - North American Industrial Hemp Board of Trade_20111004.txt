I'm working on a project, the North American Industrial Hemp Commodity Board of Trade,
so that parties can set up a foundation for investment in hemp to establish information
on the prices of August hemp fiber, August seeds, October seeds, to set up the mechanisms
for that.
We're looking to do projects that will bring everything together.
There's one thing that was changed in the law since 1937.
There was one item that was deleted from the marijuana portion, which was the provisions
for the federal government to license industrial hemp farming.
And under the U.S. Constitution, rights that are not taken by the federal government revert
back to the individual or to the local governments.
