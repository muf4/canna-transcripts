My name is Eric Llewellyn. I'm part of the CRRH. I also am a board member for Parents for Pot.
I'm also a patient and that's what I'm here fighting for is the patient accent of this all.
Us as patients, we can't always get out in life and do the things that we need to do without
certain medicines. A lot of people rely on this medicine. Without it, people can't live their
lives, go out, raise their families. Heck, I couldn't be here right now if it weren't for
cannabis. We all fought for the right to have it as a medical use. We all need to continue to fight
to keep it medical and help with those that can't get out to grow it, obtain it, smoke it. Even
smoking, like my fellow partner Nikki says, people need a place to be able to smoke their cannabis
and if they're taking those places from us, where are we going to be able to do it safely?
How are we going to obtain our medicine to maintain life? I'm just basically saying that
we need to continue to fight. Don't stop the fight because we've legalized it for recreational.
That's one step we tried to accomplish, we accomplished. But now they need to stick to
what they said and not touch our medical. Thank you all for coming out today.
