Thank you, Ted. Thanks everybody for being here. I'm Tobias Reed. I'm a Beaverton State Representative,
and I hope not only to follow Ted Wheeler on stage, but into office as State Treasurer.
You know, Oregon is a pioneer. We're not the first state to legalize, but we're still well ahead of the curve.
It means that the decisions we make in Oregon are going to be the ones that the rest of the country looks to when they legalize.
All over the state, legal cannabis businesses are off to a really strong start, exceeding expectations.
$14 million in sales in January alone? That doesn't even count medicinal marijuana.
And when extracts and edibles come online, that is going to only increase the number.
But because the federal government is dragging its feet, it's leaving states like Oregon in a bind.
Banks and credit unions can't confidently extend their services to legal cannabis businesses without risking the violation of federal law.
And imagine how dangerous and scary that is for cannabis business owners. Perhaps some of you are among them.
You have to keep thousands of dollars in cash on hand to meet payroll, to pay taxes, and buy inventory and supplies.
We have to do better than that. And while we haven't solved all our problems, that's one of the reasons I helped to pass the cannabis banking bill in Oregon in the legislature.
The federal government still needs to act, but we're one step closer.
By removing criminal liability in Oregon for the provision of banking services, we're helping to remove those duffle bags of cash that are moving around our neighborhoods and putting businesses and neighborhoods at risk.
We've got lots more to do, but this is an important first step. And I hope you'll all be with me as we continue that effort.
I appreciate you being here and wish you great luck on a successful event. Thanks very much.
