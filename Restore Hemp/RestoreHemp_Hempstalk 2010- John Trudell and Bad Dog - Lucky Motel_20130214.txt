During times of shadow, in the background of burst, the sun waits for the moon to torch
the night, torch the night. In the broken neon and faded light, the lucky motel at the
corner of nowhere and the past, where memories go to forget, to forget. Laughing to erase, her name
is Lacey. He makes his crazy kind of crazy. His name is Want. She can hear it. She wants Want, but doesn't want to.
Sparks of the stars, burnings, strong heat. Heat is like flame. As her fire awaits, she is a pulse, a pulse. In the charging light, as a passion of storm, fiery rain, lightning carries thunder.
She's a good girl, coming to understand that sometimes this is what good girls do, what good girls do. In the breath of softness, in the magic of moan, they held them together, so as not to feel so alone, so alone.
So alone. During times of shadow, in the background of burst, the sun waits for the moon to torch the night, torch the night. In the breath of softness, in the magic of moan, they held them together, so as not to feel so alone, so alone.
So alone.
