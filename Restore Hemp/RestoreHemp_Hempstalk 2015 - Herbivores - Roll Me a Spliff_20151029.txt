Yes, I'd love to check it with
Whisk me up a bud
So I can rub this heat up
In this deep, deep groove
If you just
Roll it up on this
One-way place
And let your heart
do the playing
I mean we're speaking
for this feeling
So, wait, hey
Roll me a split
to have a whiff
Whisk us up a bud
So we can rub this heat up
Tank us up a tube
We'll be rockin'
in the deep, deep groove
If you would please
Roll it
Whisk me up a bud
Crank us up a tube
We'll be rockin'
