Roger Goodman I first met when he was part of the King County Bar Association
and working on drug policy issues and since then he's gone on to a higher
elected office and so welcome Roger Goodman one of your Seattle State
Senators. Thanks, you're elected too aren't you?
Yeah I've been working with the King County Bar Association for almost a decade now
organizing lawyers and doctors and other stuff stuff shirts to give the
professional voice to drug policy reform to give opinion leaders and
policymakers some cover and now the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers that I
direct is working nationally with bar associations and all other professional
groups all across the country to do the same thing to get lawyers and particularly
lawyers but professionals to speak up about drug policy and give some courage
to policymakers to take action and as Philippe said I'm also an elected
official and vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee here in the
Washington State Legislature and in that capacity I'm one of the very few
lawyers in the legislature and my drug policy work in the legislature is at the
salad bar or in you know sort of rooms that you don't you don't see my work in
the legislature it's very quiet very subtle so testing the waters giving some
of my colleagues some different ways to frame the issue that this isn't about
drugs this is about fiscal responsibility this is about protecting
our children better this is about providing health care this is about
cleaning up public spaces and so forth we're getting close to a tipping point
so my quiet work in the legislature is working with the other suits but my not
so quiet work out in the professional world and we're making more noise now
because it's we're clearly at a point where drug policy is not just a marginal
issue anymore it's really been mainstreamed and folks understand that
it's a strategic issue so my off campus off the Capitol campus my work involves
getting those bar associations across the country such as Colorado Wisconsin
Massachusetts New York Massachusetts Bar Association just released a report two
weeks ago it's on the desk of every Massachusetts state legislator and the
title is with a nice seal on it says the failure of the war on drugs charting a
new course for the Commonwealth Commonwealth of Massachusetts you don't
even have to open it it says the failure the war on drugs and it's on the desk of
the state legislators so it's just a seeping into their minds you know that's
kind of what we're doing is giving legislators a sense that this is not an
issue to be afraid of and I'll make one more comment in that vein when I first
ran for office my opponent hit me hard on the drug policy issue that I was
going to be selling drugs to kids you know I wanted to be the state director
of drug dealing all these sort of things and my poll numbers went up afterward
so people get it one final note in that two years later I ran for re-election
against my esteemed colleague Toby Nixon and please give Toby a hand because he
is a great so okay so remember my first election I was hit hard for wanting to
sell drugs to kids and I was this evil guy two years later I run against an
opponent who agrees with us that we need to reform drug policy and in public
Toby criticized me for not being aggressive enough so in a two-year
period we've come a long way I think that's a fantastic thanks a lot Roger
it's a worthwhile mentioning when I ran for office it was I had no trouble at
the medical marijuana issue the fact that I distributed medical marijuana
never became a political issue I had more trouble convincing people to vote
green than to vote for a medical marijuana distributor
