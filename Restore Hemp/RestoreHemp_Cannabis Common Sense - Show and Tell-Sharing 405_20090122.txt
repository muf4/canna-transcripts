Vimping Cannabis Foundation's collection. This one is from Specific Medicines in Columbus, Ohio, and it's just cannabis.
The text on this bottle is hilarious. I'll try to read a little bit from it in a moment.
It's got a nifty backlight cap with their logo on it for Lloyd Brothers and Specific Medicines.
This next one is really unique. It's for migraines. Can you see it right there on there? Migraines.
It's from Sharpen Dome. That's another company that's still around.
We've got two from companies that still exist. Sharpen Dome is morphed and it has cannabis,
extracted cannabis as one of its ingredients for migraines. We had a question about that last week.
And this one is from Park Davis. It says right there, Park Davis. And it's cannabis, tincture, and these,
about a pint bottle there. Another nifty. We have several of these. This is the most recent acquisition.
We probably have about four or five of these Park Davis pint bottles in the THCF collection right now.
This label is not the best example by far, but very legible.
And right next door we have some hip milk that is distributed here in the River City, Portland, Oregon,
and it's made up in BC. There's chocolate. I drank most of this.
And we have vanilla, which is going to some of the folks in the control room who are making it.
