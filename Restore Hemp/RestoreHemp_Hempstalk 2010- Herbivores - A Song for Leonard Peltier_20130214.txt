I'm trying to be free.
The next time the devil will detain.
The rich men all over the Americas.
The rich men all over the cannibals.
They took away the creator's land.
And sent it on to the red mine.
Built them way up high at their reservation.
Built them to complete starvation.

Thank you. Yeah man, Native American rights are the same rights. You know, seems like
the little people on the bottom are always struggling to get up. A lot of people up on
top making money to keep us down. It doesn't work. You know, they say that we control it.
All we gotta do is register and vote on it. No matter what you decide to vote for, you
know, you may not be interested in international politics or you may not be interested in war,
but hey, if you haven't voted yet, it's time to get registered and vote. You know,
because the next couple of years are going to tell the whole story. Can't help it man.
I used to be one of the people who said don't do it, but you know, after you've been in
a jail cell a couple of times, you realize you really have to stand up because there's
somebody behind bars right now that you know, you know, and they're waiting for you to decide.
So let's do it.
