40 years of doing this I've learned not to set deadlines
There were times before like 1978 when we thought we had this thing in the bag and then events beyond our control
intervene
And in some cases we didn't do such a good job and things changed
So I don't like to set timelines, but we all know where we're going to end up, right?
We all know where we're going, right?
Okay, so it's just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other until we get there. We're definitely going to get there
We know that
