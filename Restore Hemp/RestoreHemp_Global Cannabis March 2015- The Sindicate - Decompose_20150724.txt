It seems like everything was cooler in a different way before a parker Shane Neville came home
Hope was such an echo that it seemed finally nobody would let it go
Running back and forth looking through my mistake but in the end it's only one of their own
When everyone I know seems more hungry and this house just ain't no home
When there's nowhere to run to when the world comes uncooked
And it's worth the haunt you just sit back and watch it explode
Seems like everything was easy when we were the hate but today just seems to evil roads
Plumbing through the pipeline like a welfare state the waste upon which we all decompose
Running back and forth looking to God in favor every corner seems to lead to the road
When time is so constricting that you want to escape but the tracks just won't let you go
When there's nowhere to run to when the world comes uncooked
And it's worth the haunt you just sit back and watch it explode
When there's nowhere to run to when the world comes uncooked
And it's worth the haunt you just sit back and watch it explode
When there's nowhere to run to when the world comes uncooked
And it's worth the haunt you just sit back and watch it explode
