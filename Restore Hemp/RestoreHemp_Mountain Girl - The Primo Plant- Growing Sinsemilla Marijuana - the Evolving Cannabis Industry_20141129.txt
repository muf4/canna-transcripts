In 1974 I started writing a book about growing marijuana. I had pot plants in
the backyard and the problem was that the problem was that that first batch of
weed that I grew was too strong and I had to give it all away. We weren't used
to weed that was that strong. It was seeds from Vietnam that a Vietnam vet
had brought back and given to me. I had four seeds and they all grew and
they were all females and they were these little cute little bushes. Man it
was just crazy strong so I had to give it all away and start over the next
season. By then I had collected a lot of different strains and decided to do a
larger garden with with 11 different strains and I so carefully labeled all
that this is all from seed so you you didn't really know what exactly you're
gonna get but people would say oh yeah somebody brought these back from Nepal
these were from Guerrero Mexico and you know these ones were from Colombia and
so label it grow it see what it does that was my whole program that year.
Meanwhile the phone's starting to ring and the phone and people are saying to
me how did you what did you put in the ground you know how did you do that when
does it show a flower what does the flower look like you know how big should
the leaves be should I be pruning it. I'm going oh my god and about a couple of
months of that and I was hoarse I couldn't talk from just and not only
that but this is the funny truth is that people would call me back again the next
day and ask me exactly the same questions because they forgot the
answers the day before. So we know something was working. Anyway I decided I
better write it down to save myself so girlfriend and I Goldie my girlfriend
Goldie and I started taking serious notes and doing some photography and
taking pictures of these things and recording and I had already been very
careful about how I how I did the garden so that it wouldn't get mixed up in
there and then I was also careful about not allowing the male plants to go to
seed because I by now heard of Sensimia but I wanted some seeds from I want to
do a little crossing so I did very careful manual with a paintbrush
crossings of a couple of different kinds but but you know the male pollen was
hard to manage because if you let that male plant I would cut them right down
so they had one little branch you know so and so I wrote all this stuff down we
kept track and kept records and within I would say within two years we knew what
we were doing so and I had by this time gotten turned on to organic gardening
because I came across a magazine about organic gardening and read it and made
so much sense to me that I knew that this was the way to go I had to go this
way because it's there was the purpose was then twofold once one was to teach
people how to grow really good good pot at home and the other one was to teach
people organic gardening which I saw as the vision of the future and nobody
even really heard of it then so I dedicated my book to the memory of Jerome
Irving Rodale who was the guy who started organic gardening magazine in
this country and then I started researching back and finding out about
these English English gardeners sir Albert Howard for instance who was also
Prince Charles illuminated mentor and this is this actually the organic
gardening had a had a deep history in France as well so suddenly I was
educating and I decided to put as much of that education into that book as
possible at the time and and yet make it simple enough so that anybody could do
it and you know here's how and how to recognize a male flower from a female
flower which nobody had never seen a flower you know pot came in a bag all
mashed together by a hydraulic press in those days anyway so suddenly we had
beautiful weed I'm gorgeous and smelly and it was like oh my gosh you know so
the fun started and I published that book it was a bestseller and I sold
50,000 copies in the first two years and you know and then the work was done you
know I had boom people knew how and suddenly there was just weed everywhere
and it was good so since the 70s the you know the research and development for
cannabis got really stunted by government repression but that wasn't
true in other places so there was actually some research going on in
France and Israel and you know places where intellectual curiosity trumps
repression and you know people began to find out a lot more about this plant but
it's only recently that we've that we've come to discover that it has so many
other vital roles for you know just juicing the leaves the big green leaves
and putting them in your morning juice apparently this is fabulous for you the
various strains of pot that they've been able to develop that have either THC or
cannabidiol in them how much of each you know and I just feel like the repression
part sort of forced a lot of this both the increase in potency because the
reduction in size and then the and then the the intense manicuring which I
personally don't have any use for I like leaves myself but just to see how
how compressed the product got and how important it was to people and how now
it's become like the wine or the wine or brandy industry you know it's this
intensely focused thing I think it's really interesting I think there's a lot
of very hip very smart thoughtful people I have gotten into the into the
production of cannabis and so the quality has just gone up and up and up
and now it's going sideways because we now understand what the chemistry is of
this plant and it's so that by going sideways it makes a much broader spectrum
of cultivars and these cultivars which is strains of pot they're they're really
interesting and we're now hearing these stories about how people have found
cures for long-term neurological problems and you know it takes the edge
off of Parkinson's is like wow look at all this and this was purely anecdotal
25 years ago
