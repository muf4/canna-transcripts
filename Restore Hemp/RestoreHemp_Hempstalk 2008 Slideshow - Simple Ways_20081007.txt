Some people like the TV, not me I just watch the sky
I feel a better sense of freedom watching the hawks and eagles fly
And the sound of the river running free out to sea
Running through the canyons, yeah that's what fills me
It's time to plant our gardens, get ready for another year
Take advantage of this weather while the sky's still blue and clear
Corn and beans, squash and kale, like to grow together
Save our seeds and keep them dry, they'll be eaten right forever
Give me a simple life in the country where I can be free
Give me a fresh spring in a garden, that's all that I need
I need an earth home on this planet to live out my days
In my heart it really loves those simple ways
Nice stretch in the morning, rise and say hi to the sun
You know we got a lot of work to do when there's enough for everyone
The rain's gonna be coming soon, we got a lot of wood to move
Gotta keep this family dry if it's the only thing we do
Give me a simple life in the country where I can be free
Give me a fresh spring in a garden, that's all that I need
I need an earth home on those simple ways
And every day, swimming in the river at the end of the day
Give me a simple life in the country where I can be free
Give me a fresh spring in a garden, that's all that I need
I need an earth home on this planet to live out my days
In my heart it really loves those simple ways
Give me a simple life in the country where I can be free
Give me a fresh spring in a garden, that's all that I need
I need an earth home on this planet to live out my days
In my heart it really loves those simple ways
In my heart it really loves those simple ways
In my heart it really loves those simple ways
