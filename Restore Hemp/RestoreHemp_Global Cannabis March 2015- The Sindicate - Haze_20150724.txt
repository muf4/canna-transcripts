Thank you guys.
We're The Syndicate.
This is our last song.
If you want to support us in other way,
we're having an album release at the Star Theater on June 12.
You can come check us out.
Talk to us more about that.
We appreciate your rally.
We appreciate you guys' cause.
You're heading in the right direction.
Soon enough, we'll be crossing the bridge
with a joint in hand, just passing it back and forth
from Janson Beach.
It'll be awesome.
Won't you light up in place?
Lost in her purple haze.
Life's just a masquerade.
Time slowly slips away.
Ooh.
She almost made it.
She was so close.
She could taste it.
Now she lies in the valley below.
Just waiting for her heart to stop.
It's beating for the devil to take her soul.
The good is poison.
The touch is killing me.
And it's hurting.
Let the pain ring over me.
And when I stop being what you're
cheap to let me be, love's weapon is pointy.
It's right at me.
Won't you light up in place?

Ooh.

Just waiting for her heart to stop.
It's beating for the devil to take her soul.

The touch is killing me.
And it's hurting.
Let the pain ring over me.
And when I stop being what you're
cheap to let me be, love's weapon is pointy.
It's right at me.
Could have been the way you left me.
Every note you gave, you sent me.
Made a fool of everyone.
Can't you take a piece from hollow?
Emptiness is in the sorrow.
The end of your life.
The good is poison.
The touch is killing me.
Love's weapon is pointy.
Right at me.
All right, thank you guys very much with the syndicate.
Enjoy the sunshine.
