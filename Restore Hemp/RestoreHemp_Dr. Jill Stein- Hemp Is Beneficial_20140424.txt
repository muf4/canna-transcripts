It's not only good for our health and safety, it's good because it creates jobs
and by legalizing hemp in particular we create a whole industry because hemp is
really a goldmine of resources and as a doctor and as a nutrition wonk you know
I can testify that there are incredible nutritional values to hemp. There are a
whole set of fatty acids that are really critical for our health that are
not otherwise widely available so there are very important nutritional and food
values to hemp as well as potential as fuel. Its value agriculturally is
especially important in this day and age of climate change where we have drought,
we have heat and all that and where the cost of fossil fuels are skyrocketing.
Fortunately with hemp it's a really stable crop you don't need you don't
need to irrigate, you don't need fossil fuel based pesticides and you don't need
fossil fuel derived fertilizers either. So it's you know it's a really important
crop especially in this day and age of climate change and likewise it's a
really important resource for manufacturing and Henry Ford in fact you
know made entire automobiles out of hemp. Mercedes-Benz still uses hemp as
part of the I think the panels in their manufacturing process so you know not to
mention its uses in fiber as well. So there are just a whole bunch of
manufacturing uses for hemp. It can be grown locally, it can be grown by small
farmers so this is a valuable resource that that the American people should not
be deprived of because of obsolete laws.
