of the principles of gasification.
This is a lit cigarette
and when the air goes
the normal direction, when the air goes this way
all the oxygen is burned up and
makes heat and it roasts the tobacco into charcoal.
You see how white that smoke is?
I hope you're able to pick that up. Now, if I blow this way
there's oxygen available right at the flame front.
See how the smoke is invisible?
That's the principle right there.
Okay, this is tar destruction. This is tar production.
One third of the weight
of the cigarette gets turned into tars
when I reverse it.
So one third equals 300,000 parts per million.
Okay, that's one third is 300,000
parts per million. I'm rounding off.
Now, when I reverse the flow, I take it down to 1,000 parts per million.
I don't know how to express the
reduction, but I'll call that a 300-fold reduction in tars.
And that gives us a gas that's much more cleanable
because those tars will gum up an engine.
And then I have a patent
that I was the inventor of which takes us down from 1,000 parts per million
down to under 100 parts per million tars
which gives us a very easily cleanable gas.
