I feel fertile tonight, are you game?
Play your cards right and I won't take your name
I just want your babies, it's not like it's your Mercedes
I'm so hungry for you, I could eat for two
Knock me up if you love me
Knock me up if you don't
If you ever wanted an unwanted baby
Knock me up
Honey, knock me up
I have some issues to address
So quickly, let's both address
I just need your love injection
I don't need your affection or protection
Knock me up if you love me
Knock me up if you don't
If you ever wanted an unwanted baby
Knock me up
Honey, knock me up
Knock me up
Please, knock me up
