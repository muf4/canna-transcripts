I was a battalion scout and point man and any of you guys are veterans you
know what the hell a point man means the life expectancy is about 30 minutes or
so something like that and I was in a war history writing class with about 10
Vietnam guys and I told him that I was a point man and scout they says oh no you
weren't and I says god damn it yes I was and he's now you weren't if you were
you'd be dead so here I am mean as hell and so forth how many of you read the
story in the Oregonian last week about the DEA trying to get hold of your
patients charts how many you raise your hands you read that well let me tell you
the DEA skunks and the local cops are all going crazy because you bastards
have permits to use marijuana and you have permits to grow it and your
permits to carry it you have permits to give it to somebody else and all that
kind of stuff and there are 15,000 of you guys with permits right now 15,000
in Oregon and about 7,000 caregiver growers so that makes about 22,000
people who have the permits right now now this is this is small potatoes
because in California there are over 300,000 people who have permits well
California understand is a little bit larger than Oregon you you don't mind if
I say Oregon do you you know well I lived this east of the Mississippi for
about 20 years or so and back there I was from Oregon and that used to grate
on my nerves and so I finally figured out thank God they've never been out
here because if they ever say that in the state of Oregon they get somebody
hit him over the head with a brick yeah thank you sir or madam
when the board took away my license in November three years ago I was really
disgusted with this because they thought that they were punishing me they were
not punishing me they were they were punishing my 4,000 patients and and I I
get the idea that they were trying to stop the medical marijuana program but
as most of you know the THC Foundation Clinic is probably seeing about 200
patients a week and we're increasing the number of patients all the time there
are 2,200 doctors in Oregon now who are signing applications 2,200 of them and
some of you know many of you don't know I'm actually an osteopathic doctor and
believe it or not there are 200 osteopathic doctors who are signing
these applications and I thought I was the only one and because I thought I was
the only one I was a real bad person and that's one of the reasons why I'm
wearing this cute thing right here that I'm I'm the most dangerous man in Oregon
because it said so in Oregonian. We love you Dr. Buck. That reminds me thank you very
much that reminds me of several years ago on our television program a man
phoned up and wanted to know if his medical condition would permit him to
get a permit and so forth and and so he told me what his medical condition was
and I says hell yes I said you're eligible come on to the office and he
says Dr. Levesque I'd like to have a relationship with you and I said if you
don't mind please don't say that on television so I hope you you two guys
don't want to have a relationship with me because I I gave all that stuff up I
I was a Boy Scout till I was 14 and then I became a Girl Scout. I have just
started writing articles about medical marijuana the website is called Salem
dash news dot com and I try to write at least one article a week about all the
sundry aspects of medical marijuana what we're concentrating on right now
is post-traumatic stress disorder. How many vets I got in the office here? You
poor dumb bastards. Don't volunteer for a ship that's all I have to say. At any rate
even the Veterans Administration admits that they are failing to take care of
post-traumatic stress patients which which is a real surprise because I was
in the VA hospital about 50 years ago and they told my mother on three
occasions that we don't believe your son's gonna make it and I fooled them
and I survived and then about two years later I met one of my doctors in the
hallway of the medical school and he looks me up and down he says you're a
Leveque aren't you and I said yeah I'm a Leveque. He says well are you a janitor
here and I says no I'm a PhD candidate he says really I says what do you mean
really he says we never thought you'd be normal again so if any of you think
that I'm normal you're crazier than hell. Now does it do any of you have any
questions of any something or other? I have I have become one of the world's
authorities on medical marijuana so ask me anything. How do I qualify for to get
a card? Oh okay how bashful are you? Come up here and talk to me. Come on get up here.
In what? Marijuana used for ADHD? Oh hey that's a very good question and fact of the matter is over this past week I wrote two articles about ADD and ADHD
and the California doctors oh my my microphone by whose mouth my mouth oh
okay the doctors in California and as far as I know there are about 70 doctors
in California who are writing these permits but just like I say they have
written over 300,000 by now and the DEA and the local cops are going crazy down
there because well what the hell you're just a bunch of potheads and you don't
deserve even the time of day so ADD and ADHD are good. Now I was invited back to
a to a subcommittee at Congress three years ago by representative Souder from
Indiana and he represented Eli Lillian company in Indianapolis who had just
developed a new ADD ADHD drug and so what Souder wanted to do was to quash
the medical marijuana in the United States completely and so I was invited
back there and I was told by the marijuana policy project that they were
going to skin me alive so I decided not to go but the strain now that it Eli
Lilly company figured that the ADD drug would bring in a billion dollars a year
but after it was released and used for about six months they found out it
didn't work now this is really crazy because marijuana does work for kids and
and they don't smoke but they eat it in cookies how many of your cookie eaters
how many of you are smokers I don't know why the hell I asked that no no I don't
I don't well that's not exactly true about six years ago my youngest son gave
me a loaded bong for Christmas and he says I'll dare you to light it up well I
think it was pretty bad grass or some goddamn thing probably Mexican mud who
knows something like that but in your end I took a couple hits of it I says
Jesus Christ what's what's so great about this stuff is you're not taking
enough of it how many of you have heard that how many of you ever been high how
many of you been high twice what'd you say how many guys have been high 37 years
straight I think this is hilarious well I will say I will say that when I became
a graduate student at the medical school the first thing the chairman says LeVac
go into the stockroom and see if you can straighten it out so I went into the
stockroom and the first thing that I found was a gallon jug of cannabis cough
medicine this was 13 years after it was declared illegal for anybody in the
United States to have anything like that and I said well it was made by Park
Davis and company which is one of the largest in the world and I poured myself
a pint and I took it home and I tried it out and it works and so I still have
that pint someplace around my house and I'll find it one of these days but that
was the only time that I actually smoked marijuana at that time but I have used
the tincture and I've used the oil and they work fine for me and how many of
you ever had bad grass did you like it raise your hands if you enjoyed it then
like it well it's great that in British Columbia they're growing some of the
best grass in the world and some of the plants are being grown in the Portland
area you probably know that how many of you know that you know that very good
what do you want this guy says he's gonna cut my throat so does anybody have
any final question here to ask me don't get smart with me fella glad to be here
I'm gonna turn around and give you all a very short very short picture of
cannabis therapeutics take a look at it isn't that more fun than it ought to be
thank you very much do not smoke in the rain
