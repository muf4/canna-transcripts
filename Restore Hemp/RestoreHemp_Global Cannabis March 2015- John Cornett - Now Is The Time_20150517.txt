Now is the time, time is now
To tell the truth, to hear the truth
To know the truth, to know the truth
Corporations, governments are rarely ever innocent
Decision is the only way, and live to see another day
Sound the alarm, investigate
Sound the alarm, re-educate
Now is the time, for the truth
Now is the time
Now is the time
Time is now
To speak the truth, to speak it
To seek the truth, to be the truth
To be the truth
Sound the alarm, re-educate
Sound the alarm, investigate
Now is the time, for the truth
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time
All we gotta do is just seek the truth
It's out there
