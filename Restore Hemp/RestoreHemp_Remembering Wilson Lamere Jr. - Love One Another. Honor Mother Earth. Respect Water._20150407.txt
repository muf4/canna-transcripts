There's a lot of freedom fighters out there.
And we're fighting for human lives to make this world a beautiful place.
And I thank my brother here, Jim Atkinson.
We go back a long ways and we've always fought for human rights.
We believe in this medicine, this marijuana is a great medicine.
And it heals all.
And there's only one thing that we ask for.
And it's real easy to do.
And it's called love.
Love one another.
Honor mother earth.
Respect water, because without water there's no life.
And to all my relations here, I thank you again.
It's a beautiful day and it's a beautiful weather.
It's a beautiful people here and all the people that work so hard.
Especially my brother, Evian here.
He does so great, he works so hard.
Like he said, he picks up every piece of paper, every cigarette butt.
And if people could help pick up a little bit of garbage before you leave,
it would really help the people.
I do it once again, like I said, once again, to all my relations, I love you.
Happy Happy!
When is my brother going to be free?
When is my brother going to be free?
I like it. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to make a circle.
We're going to dance for unity. We're going to dance for mother earth.
If you would join me out in the circle, my brother is going to sing a song
in honor of everyone that's here and have a safe trip home.
And I hope you find everything like you left it.
And to all my relations, God bless you.
