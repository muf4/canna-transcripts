Wow, look at this. It's a marijuana patch.
Growing Wild. Oh, who do we have in the marijuana patch but Jack Herrer and Edith Ayer.
Well, hi guys.
They must be on the hemp tour. Are you on the hemp tour, guys?
We're on the hemp tour.
We've got hemp.
Growing Wild. Look at this, folks. Look at this. This is hemp. This is hemp.
None of this is female, though.
This is all male. Look at this. Look at the seeds.
It's sitting there. This is organic matter.
I can't look at it, even?
Oh, shit. Really? Can't look at it.
This is hemp land. We're going into hemp.
Going into the hemp.
Yes.
We're inside of the hemp now.
This is hemp. We're inside hemp.
About 10 or 12 feet. See, look. See?
This is the sky.
Look at this great background.
This is natural, wild hemp.
Do you think you're going to succeed?
Oh, yeah. Why not? Nobody can beat the truth.
Can anybody beat the truth?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
No way, man.
I've been out there telling the truth, and nobody's ever said we're wrong.
They keep arresting us 33 times.
They have beaten us in jails.
They have done physical things to me I'm not going to describe on this air.
But there's nothing that can beat a fact, and I don't care how popular a president thinks he is.
When people realize that he's killed off a planet, and he's killed off the knowledge of a planet,
and he's allowed millions of people to die prematurely and in pain and in misery,
and has ruined the quality of life that can be gotten with a good, simple medicine
that never killed anybody except at the hands of bad public policy
and police carrying out bad public policy with a vengeance.
