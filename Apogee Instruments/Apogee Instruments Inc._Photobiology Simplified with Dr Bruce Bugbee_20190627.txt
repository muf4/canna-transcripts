[00:01.020 --> 00:09.220]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and I want to talk in the next few minutes
[00:09.220 --> 00:19.240]  about photobiology and how ratios of colors of light affect both plant shape and plant
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.300]  growth.
[00:20.300 --> 00:23.240]  And by plant growth we mean photosynthesis.
[00:23.240 --> 00:25.980]  So these are two different things.
[00:25.980 --> 00:29.620]  Now many, many papers have been written on this.
[00:29.620 --> 00:34.420]  My laboratory at the university has published extensively on this.
[00:34.420 --> 00:38.700]  I've spoken many times on this.
[00:38.700 --> 00:41.380]  This is a bit like diet and people.
[00:41.380 --> 00:43.260]  What's the perfect diet for people?
[00:43.260 --> 00:45.980]  Well different diets vary for different people.
[00:45.980 --> 00:51.320]  But I want to try and capture the elements of this very simply to show you the concepts
[00:51.320 --> 00:52.500]  of it.
[00:52.500 --> 00:57.180]  So we're going to take plant growth.
[00:57.180 --> 01:06.580]  Let's start with colors and we're going to start right here with 400 nanometers.
[01:06.580 --> 01:09.980]  This is roughly the start of human vision.
[01:09.980 --> 01:15.580]  And we're going to go over here to 700 nanometers.
[01:15.580 --> 01:29.380]  And right in the 500, here's 500, here's 600, and over here we'll put 800.
[01:29.380 --> 01:35.380]  So these are the wavelengths associated with colors of light.
[01:35.380 --> 01:41.700]  Now if we do blue, this is blue here.
[01:41.700 --> 01:44.860]  This is elementary but it's important to the understanding.
[01:44.860 --> 01:57.340]  This out here is red and green right here, GRN, green.
[01:57.340 --> 02:04.660]  These are the three primary wavelengths that drive photosynthesis and they're roughly equal,
[02:04.660 --> 02:09.740]  which is why we get photosynthetic radiation.
[02:09.740 --> 02:13.380]  And we say that's equal across here.
[02:13.380 --> 02:16.380]  All these colors contribute equally.
[02:16.380 --> 02:18.380]  In truth we know they're not quite equal.
[02:18.380 --> 02:20.620]  The blue is a little less.
[02:20.620 --> 02:27.140]  The curve is something like this for plant growth.
[02:27.140 --> 02:29.620]  But we still count them equally.
[02:29.620 --> 02:34.140]  But the issue here is not so much plant growth but plant shape.
[02:34.140 --> 02:38.140]  Plant shape is what we can manipulate with colors of light.
[02:38.140 --> 02:51.780]  And now we have to add in the far red out here and that's generally up to 750 nanometers.
[02:51.780 --> 02:54.500]  So here's far red.
[02:54.500 --> 03:04.100]  We also need to add in the UV down here and this is another little edge right here from
[03:04.100 --> 03:08.120]  350 up to 400.
[03:08.120 --> 03:14.000]  This goes shorter than this but this is the beneficial UV.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.680]  Shorter than this is usually bad but there's a lot of good effects of UV from 350 to 400.
[03:20.680 --> 03:28.320]  All right, one, two, three, four, five categories of light.
[03:28.320 --> 03:34.320]  The most efficient LEDs are reds and blues.
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.820]  So for a long time we had only reds and blues and magenta LEDs.
[03:38.820 --> 03:43.280]  We still have those because these two colors are efficient.
[03:43.280 --> 03:46.520]  But now we know the green photons are just fine.
[03:46.520 --> 03:49.360]  They cause excellent photosynthesis.
[03:49.360 --> 03:51.840]  They penetrate deep into canopies.
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.360]  There's a lot of good reasons to have some green in your lights.
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.000]  Plus, these are the photons that humans can see really well.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.300]  So we want some green in.
[04:04.300 --> 04:15.000]  So the most efficient LEDs are the whites have, let's see if I can put this in blue,
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.680]  have a lot of blue light and then they fluoresce in the green and taper off.
[04:24.680 --> 04:27.480]  See if I can make that go up.
[04:27.480 --> 04:32.640]  This is generally a white LED and it's a cool white.
[04:32.640 --> 04:35.100]  Cool white means it looks very white.
[04:35.100 --> 04:37.320]  There's a lot of blue light in there.
[04:37.320 --> 04:43.960]  This is the most efficient color of white LEDs is blue LEDs.
[04:43.960 --> 04:45.600]  Most of the research has gone into these.
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.040]  These have come a long ways.
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.720]  But here's the problem.
[04:50.720 --> 04:57.760]  The blue light causes a little less photosynthesis, but more importantly, blue light shrinks plants.
[04:57.760 --> 05:03.280]  So you get all that blue light and you get a small compact plant.
[05:03.280 --> 05:06.920]  That's often considered bad, but it depends.
[05:06.920 --> 05:12.680]  If you plant at a higher plant density, compact plants can be very good.
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.760]  In indoor agriculture, we want short plants.
[05:15.760 --> 05:20.600]  So high blue light is not necessarily bad.
[05:20.600 --> 05:23.500]  And that's also a very efficient LED.
[05:23.500 --> 05:25.560]  But here's the key.
[05:25.560 --> 05:33.360]  If we take a cool white LED with high blue and compact, now we can add out here some
[05:33.360 --> 05:36.800]  far red.
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.000]  And far red does the exact opposite of blue.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.500]  This expands plants.
[05:42.500 --> 05:46.960]  It makes the leaves expand more and it makes the plants get taller.
[05:46.960 --> 05:54.320]  So the cutting edge of research now is the combinations of far red and high blue light
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.560]  to shape the plants.
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.780]  And we turn the dials.
[05:56.780 --> 05:57.780]  We want tall plants.
[05:57.780 --> 06:00.780]  We want short plants, wide plants.
[06:00.780 --> 06:08.020]  These are the two primary colors that we use to shape plants in different ratios.
[06:08.020 --> 06:14.160]  These are efficient LEDs and so are far red efficient LEDs.
[06:14.160 --> 06:15.760]  And so are the whites.
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.960]  So we can rearrange these colors.
[06:18.960 --> 06:28.200]  By this analysis, the greens and the reds become like filler colors.
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.080]  They cause photosynthesis, but they don't have the power to shape the plants that the
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.840]  blue and far red photons have.
[06:35.840 --> 06:44.040]  So this is a concise summary of work in my laboratory that we're doing to shape plants.
[06:44.040 --> 06:46.300]  Lettuce is in a unique category.
[06:46.300 --> 06:49.120]  Lettuce responds very well to far red.
[06:49.120 --> 06:50.440]  It expands the leaves.
[06:50.440 --> 06:51.880]  It causes rapid growth.
[06:51.880 --> 06:53.580]  This is terrific.
[06:53.580 --> 07:00.780]  But if you give these far red photons to tomatoes, they mostly get taller, and that's bad.
[07:00.780 --> 07:05.600]  Most crops respond to far red by getting tall.
[07:05.600 --> 07:07.200]  It's unfortunate.
[07:07.200 --> 07:15.800]  But lettuce and spinach and leafy greens respond to far red by growing more leaves.
[07:15.800 --> 07:16.840]  That's a good thing.
[07:16.840 --> 07:21.600]  So we can use far red to counteract blue for crops like lettuce.
[07:21.600 --> 07:24.000]  How about cannabis?
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.640]  Everybody wants to know colors of light.
[07:26.640 --> 07:29.720]  Cannabis far red makes it taller.
[07:29.720 --> 07:31.900]  Blue makes it shorter.
[07:31.900 --> 07:35.520]  So cannabis is more like tomatoes in this thing.
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.480]  We got to be careful not to give too much far red for cannabis because they get too
[07:39.480 --> 07:40.960]  tall.
[07:40.960 --> 07:47.360]  So this is a very concise summary of some of the cutting-edge research and thresholds
[07:47.360 --> 07:49.600]  for light.
[07:49.600 --> 07:59.760]  Because far red is so powerful, Apogee has developed a sensor that measures separately
[07:59.760 --> 08:09.760]  PPFD in here has two detectors, and it has a far red detector out here.
[08:09.760 --> 08:12.180]  So it's two detectors in the same sensor.
[08:12.180 --> 08:19.320]  So you can tune your growth chamber to optimize it for both colors of light.
[08:19.320 --> 08:20.240]  Thanks for listening.
