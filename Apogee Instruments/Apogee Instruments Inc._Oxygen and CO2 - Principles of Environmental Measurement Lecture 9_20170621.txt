[00:01.660 --> 00:23.320]  Because now we're talking about not
[00:23.320 --> 00:26.040]  radiation or wind or reflectance but a
[00:26.040 --> 00:31.520]  measurement of gases in the air and
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.000]  particularly oxygen. This is so
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.800]  powerful because gases are used to
[00:38.800 --> 00:42.640]  measure metabolic rates of bacteria, of
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.680]  plants, of people and particularly of
[00:46.680 --> 00:49.840]  course oxygen and CO2. We measure
[00:49.840 --> 00:52.360]  photosynthesis by measuring CO2
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.320]  changes but oxygen also changes and
[00:57.320 --> 01:01.280]  oxygen sensors are far cheaper than CO2
[01:01.280 --> 01:06.280]  sensors. So we have for some time sold
[01:06.280 --> 01:11.120]  this oxygen sensor. This is a picture of
[01:11.120 --> 01:13.240]  what it looks like buried in soil. It's
[01:13.240 --> 01:15.840]  one of the common applications putting
[01:15.840 --> 01:19.440]  it in soil to measure soil gas
[01:19.440 --> 01:22.960]  concentration. Obviously if a plant is
[01:22.960 --> 01:25.240]  growing and it's healthy and it's
[01:25.240 --> 01:27.960]  consuming oxygen in the soil the oxygen
[01:27.960 --> 01:31.600]  goes down in the soil. So number one we
[01:31.600 --> 01:33.720]  want to understand how low that is but
[01:33.720 --> 01:35.360]  number two the rate at which it goes
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.040]  down helps us tell the respiration rate
[01:39.040 --> 01:41.360]  of the root system of the plant which
[01:41.360 --> 01:44.160]  tells us something about health of the
[01:44.160 --> 01:48.200]  plant. So it's both to monitor oxygen and
[01:48.200 --> 01:54.880]  to do metabolic rate studies. This sensor
[01:54.880 --> 01:57.440]  fundamentally it's a galvanic cell
[01:57.440 --> 02:00.800]  sensor so it causes a chemical reaction
[02:00.800 --> 02:04.520]  with the oxygen gas which creates a tiny
[02:04.520 --> 02:07.400]  voltage and it's measured by a data
[02:07.400 --> 02:10.480]  logger. So that's the general physics of
[02:10.480 --> 02:14.000]  the signal transduction of this, changing
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.520]  of the gas. It has a screen on the end.
[02:19.520 --> 02:21.680]  I don't know if we have an oxygen sensor
[02:21.680 --> 02:24.320]  here. Peter do you know if we have an
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.840]  oxygen sensor here? You can pass one
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.680]  around. That helps keep the
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.600]  water away from the sensing tip but also
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.480]  to measure a bigger volume of soil.
[02:35.480 --> 02:40.520]  These are a few hundred dollars. I
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.880]  can't remember the exact price but
[02:41.880 --> 02:43.480]  they're not thousands so that means
[02:43.560 --> 02:45.440]  they're much more accessible to many
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.800]  more people to have multiple sensors. I
[02:48.800 --> 02:52.480]  think I have a couple example pictures
[02:52.480 --> 02:54.920]  of this and then I want to talk about
[02:54.920 --> 02:58.480]  how they work. Here's one application in
[02:58.480 --> 03:00.080]  the lab. We've used this quite a bit in
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.840]  my lab. There's a petri dish sealed. The
[03:03.840 --> 03:06.360]  tip, drill a tiny hole, put the
[03:06.360 --> 03:08.400]  sensor in there and we're measuring the
[03:08.400 --> 03:11.920]  change in oxygen in this petri dish
[03:11.960 --> 03:14.240]  which is an indication of the metabolic
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.080]  rate of these seeds. Real sensitive
[03:17.080 --> 03:18.640]  to this, here's another one in a jar.
[03:18.640 --> 03:20.960]  Drill a hole, put the sensor in the top.
[03:20.960 --> 03:25.000]  Now in this jar there's no respiration
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.600]  going on. It's clear water. It's
[03:27.600 --> 03:30.120]  metabolically inert but if we run the
[03:30.120 --> 03:32.040]  temperature up and down we would like to
[03:32.040 --> 03:34.680]  get zeros in that jar and all kinds of
[03:34.680 --> 03:36.820]  things are changing. The humidity in the
[03:36.820 --> 03:39.960]  jar is changing which dilutes the oxygen
[03:39.960 --> 03:42.600]  but we want to make the appropriate
[03:42.600 --> 03:44.840]  correction factors so we can get a clean
[03:44.840 --> 03:46.800]  zero in a jar where there really isn't
[03:46.800 --> 03:49.600]  any respiration. This is a laboratory
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.440]  use of this but also has a similar uses
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.520]  in the field. Just a review, I'd love to
[03:58.520 --> 04:01.000]  show this equation. This is the, I tell
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.200]  the students, this is the most important
[04:04.200 --> 04:06.800]  equation in the world to a biologist.
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.600]  This is respiration going this way and
[04:09.600 --> 04:12.520]  photosynthesis going this way and if we
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.440]  can measure the rate of oxygen
[04:15.440 --> 04:19.040]  depletion or the rate of CO2 buildup we
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.880]  know the metabolic rate. That's
[04:20.880 --> 04:23.840]  just as simple as that. One mole of
[04:23.840 --> 04:27.760]  oxygen disappearing means one mole of
[04:27.760 --> 04:30.440]  carbon has been metabolized in
[04:30.440 --> 04:34.000]  respiration. We can precisely calculate
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.240]  metabolism and you can do that with
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.640]  either oxygen or CO2. The background of
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.880]  oxygen is much higher. This is a
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.680]  picture of it with the meter and the
[04:46.680 --> 04:51.600]  sensor on the end. Now to come full
[04:51.600 --> 04:54.760]  circle in the very first talk I talked
[04:54.760 --> 04:57.640]  about relative and absolute humidity,
[04:57.640 --> 05:02.520]  that's a water vapor in air. That same
[05:02.560 --> 05:06.600]  principle applies to all the gases in
[05:06.600 --> 05:10.160]  air. We have relative measurements which
[05:10.160 --> 05:13.040]  are listed here and we have absolute
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.720]  units listed on the other side. Relative,
[05:17.720 --> 05:20.480]  not surprisingly, it's percent. The same
[05:20.480 --> 05:23.920]  exact concept as relative humidity. We
[05:23.920 --> 05:26.480]  can call that mole fraction, the
[05:26.480 --> 05:28.840]  pressure of oxygen divided by total
[05:28.840 --> 05:31.000]  pressure, parts per million, another
[05:31.080 --> 05:35.080]  measure the same thing. In this case,
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.000]  in the case of humidity, the sensors
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.520]  measure relative units and we calculated
[05:41.520 --> 05:45.160]  absolute units. In this case, the sensor
[05:45.160 --> 05:48.000]  is measuring the absolute units and we
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.280]  convert to relative units. These
[05:54.280 --> 05:58.400]  units are exactly the
[05:58.400 --> 06:01.640]  same. The moles are mass of the gas per
[06:01.640 --> 06:06.000]  unit volume. Let me go through a couple
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.360]  of examples of how this affects us. Now
[06:09.360 --> 06:14.200]  this all comes from what we all learned
[06:14.200 --> 06:17.560]  in even high school chemistry, PV equals
[06:17.560 --> 06:20.280]  NRT, pressure and volume equals the moles
[06:20.280 --> 06:23.240]  times ideal gas constant times absolute
[06:23.240 --> 06:25.680]  temperature. If you're making these
[06:25.720 --> 06:28.560]  measurements, you get good at making
[06:28.560 --> 06:30.840]  those conversions so you can calculate
[06:30.840 --> 06:34.520]  metabolic rate. Here's sensors respond to
[06:34.520 --> 06:37.520]  absolute and we calibrate it in relative.
[06:37.520 --> 06:40.520]  Barometric pressure affects the
[06:40.520 --> 06:43.160]  concentration of gas in the air. It's
[06:43.160 --> 06:46.800]  easy to measure pressure, easy to measure
[06:46.800 --> 06:48.520]  it electronically. I'm not going to talk
[06:48.520 --> 06:50.680]  about our sensor, but easy to measure it.
[06:50.680 --> 06:54.720]  If the pressure changes and gets higher
[06:54.760 --> 06:56.960]  pressure that gas gets more dense and
[06:56.960 --> 06:59.360]  you conclude that there's respiration,
[06:59.360 --> 07:01.280]  but there's not. It's a change in
[07:01.280 --> 07:04.000]  pressure. Here's a great way to show it.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.600]  Elevation, barometric pressure is the red
[07:07.600 --> 07:09.480]  line as we go up the top of Mount
[07:09.480 --> 07:12.600]  Everest and the unit over here is
[07:12.600 --> 07:16.120]  concentration of gas. Now here's another
[07:16.120 --> 07:20.600]  test question. We know virtually
[07:20.600 --> 07:23.400]  everybody needs compressed oxygen to
[07:23.400 --> 07:26.680]  climb Mount Everest. What's the
[07:26.680 --> 07:28.920]  percent oxygen at sea level?
[07:28.920 --> 07:33.640]  It's 20.95%. What's the percent oxygen on
[07:33.640 --> 07:37.680]  the top of Mount Everest? It's exactly
[07:37.680 --> 07:41.040]  the same. So if it's 20.95%
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.680]  why we need oxygen?
[07:42.680 --> 07:45.440]  Well low pressure, the density of oxygen
[07:45.440 --> 07:48.840]  molecules is way less. That's an
[07:48.840 --> 07:51.840]  example of the correction for pressure.
[07:51.880 --> 07:55.000]  When we're measuring this, we often
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.880]  measure pressure with it so we can
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.120]  correct for differences in pressure and
[08:00.120 --> 08:05.120]  sort out metabolism from everything else.
[08:05.120 --> 08:07.680]  Pressure doesn't change that much.
[08:07.680 --> 08:09.560]  High pressure fronts, low pressure fronts.
[08:09.560 --> 08:12.240]  This is a high altitude pressure, but
[08:12.240 --> 08:15.040]  still pressure from highs to lows only
[08:15.040 --> 08:17.000]  changes the density of air about
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.520]  1% and maybe 2% on extreme
[08:20.560 --> 08:23.760]  events. Our pressures, even though
[08:23.760 --> 08:25.560]  they have a huge effect on our weather,
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.640]  only have a small effect on the density
[08:28.640 --> 08:32.480]  of gas, but we measure and correct for
[08:32.480 --> 08:36.280]  that. Now we put this sensor in soil
[08:36.280 --> 08:40.000]  and we're going to measure the changes
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.720]  in oxygen in soil. Soil is very close to
[08:44.720 --> 08:47.760]  100% humidity all the time
[08:47.760 --> 08:50.480]  because it's all these wet surfaces all
[08:50.480 --> 08:56.200]  in equilibrium with the gas. What happens
[08:56.200 --> 08:59.040]  if you put a sensor in soil like this?
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.200]  It's a tiny gore-tex
[09:03.200 --> 09:05.800]  membrane that's gas permeable, but it
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.480]  doesn't let water into the sensor. If you
[09:09.480 --> 09:11.480]  put that in soil and you just leave it,
[09:11.480 --> 09:14.640]  sooner or later it gets condensation on
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.080]  the membrane because 100% humidity and
[09:17.080 --> 09:19.960]  the soil temperature is cycling.
[09:19.960 --> 09:22.480]  The sensor stops working. The membrane
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.240]  has got water on it, gas can't come in.
[09:27.240 --> 09:30.040]  We heat the sensor just a little bit,
[09:30.040 --> 09:33.640]  just one degree C above background and
[09:33.640 --> 09:36.720]  that prevents condensation. It's not
[09:36.720 --> 09:39.520]  enough to change the metabolism, but it
[09:39.520 --> 09:42.040]  is enough to keep the condensation off
[09:42.040 --> 09:45.800]  the sensor. The other factor, the reason
[09:45.800 --> 09:51.480]  water vapor is a big deal, is water vapor
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.680]  is maybe 3% of the molecules in
[09:54.680 --> 09:56.840]  the air, but as the humidity and
[09:56.840 --> 09:59.760]  temperature go up and down the oxygen
[09:59.760 --> 10:02.800]  gets diluted. These water vapor molecules
[10:02.800 --> 10:04.680]  come in and again it's apparent
[10:04.680 --> 10:07.400]  respiration only because of dilution of
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.680]  the gas. I won't go through all the
[10:10.680 --> 10:13.440]  details of this, but you have to
[10:13.440 --> 10:15.680]  correct for the temperature of the
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.200]  soil to get the absolute oxygen
[10:19.200 --> 10:21.920]  concentration. This is happening in
[10:21.920 --> 10:24.200]  the background in software of the
[10:24.200 --> 10:29.440]  sensor to sort out what fraction of the
[10:29.440 --> 10:32.400]  change in signal is true metabolism by
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.880]  plant roots and what fraction is just
[10:34.880 --> 10:38.360]  apparent caused by changes in the gas
[10:38.360 --> 10:41.160]  composition. Obviously, if this
[10:41.160 --> 10:47.600]  thing in air and it gave us a 21% and
[10:47.600 --> 10:48.800]  then we put it in a 100%
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.920]  humidity it starts to read
[10:51.920 --> 10:54.640]  lower because of all the
[10:54.640 --> 10:58.240]  water vapor molecules diluting the
[10:58.240 --> 11:03.160]  oxygen molecules. There it is, same thing
[11:03.160 --> 11:05.040]  and that's how we do this test and the
[11:05.040 --> 11:08.320]  corrections for it. Finally, the third
[11:08.360 --> 11:11.920]  thing is temperature PVNRT. This is
[11:11.920 --> 11:15.120]  absolute Kelvin temperature, but as the
[11:15.120 --> 11:17.440]  temperature goes up and down it also
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.160]  changes the density of the air and the
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.280]  oxygen in the air. Then there's a
[11:25.280 --> 11:28.200]  temperature effect on electronics of the
[11:28.200 --> 11:31.560]  sensor we had to correct for and then gas
[11:31.560 --> 11:34.360]  liquid partitioning, the amount of gas
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.000]  and solution and the amount in the air.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.200]  Here's the temperature and the
[11:41.200 --> 11:44.120]  apparent change in reading this is 19 to
[11:44.120 --> 11:47.920]  22 degrees. It's a big effect of
[11:47.920 --> 11:56.680]  temperature. This red line
[11:56.680 --> 11:58.960]  is the effect on the electronics and
[11:58.960 --> 12:01.280]  fortunately it's pretty flat in here
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.640]  from about 15 to 35 C, but at hot and
[12:06.640 --> 12:08.800]  cold temperatures we need to correct for
[12:08.800 --> 12:11.400]  temperature. Temperature affects almost
[12:11.400 --> 12:13.880]  every single sensor we have. There's
[12:13.880 --> 12:15.840]  hardly any sensor that doesn't have some
[12:15.840 --> 12:18.200]  temperature interaction and we're always
[12:18.200 --> 12:20.960]  measuring those and correcting for them
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.360]  in software or trying to build sensors
[12:23.360 --> 12:25.680]  that are so robust they have a minimal
[12:25.800 --> 12:33.740]  temperature effect. Now a couple
[12:33.740 --> 12:36.220]  slides since the final slides. I'm going
[12:36.220 --> 12:39.300]  to close with people have suggested
[12:39.300 --> 12:41.300]  sensors we might build and as a
[12:41.300 --> 12:43.420]  company we're constantly thinking of
[12:43.420 --> 12:45.540]  what's our next sensor we're going to
[12:45.540 --> 12:49.580]  work on and how do we decide what
[12:49.580 --> 12:52.460]  kind of sensors to work on. I'll tell you
[12:52.460 --> 12:55.700]  it's not brain surgery. How
[12:55.740 --> 12:58.500]  many we going to sell? How many people
[12:58.500 --> 13:00.420]  would buy a sensor like this if we build
[13:00.420 --> 13:02.500]  it? If it's 10 we probably won't build
[13:02.500 --> 13:05.580]  the sensor. If it's a hundred then we
[13:05.580 --> 13:07.820]  decide how much R&D will it take to make
[13:07.820 --> 13:10.460]  the first one. It's a ratio of
[13:10.460 --> 13:13.780]  investment cost for R&D to the number
[13:13.780 --> 13:16.660]  sold and when that gets favorable we
[13:16.660 --> 13:19.860]  decide to work on the sensor. It's
[13:19.860 --> 13:23.140]  also how much R&D will it take.
[13:23.140 --> 13:25.100]  I don't know how long we've
[13:25.140 --> 13:27.020]  been working on that net radiometer.
[13:27.020 --> 13:33.900]  We got a lot of money
[13:33.900 --> 13:36.820]  invested in making the first one and so
[13:36.820 --> 13:39.940]  we're just now getting them on the
[13:39.940 --> 13:42.300]  market. You hold your breath as a
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.900]  company and hope people will buy the
[13:43.900 --> 13:45.780]  stuff that you build otherwise you're
[13:45.780 --> 13:47.020]  going to be out of business.
[13:47.020 --> 13:50.780]  Here's a sensor that we're looking
[13:50.780 --> 13:53.340]  at. We've done some preliminary testing
[13:53.340 --> 13:56.140]  and I could make a joke and say don't
[13:56.140 --> 13:58.740]  tell our competitors about this but even
[13:58.740 --> 14:00.220]  if you told them they'd say well that's
[14:00.220 --> 14:01.780]  a hard sensor to build we're not going
[14:01.780 --> 14:03.420]  to make it because it's too much of a
[14:03.420 --> 14:07.180]  risk. There's a lot of R&D. If we
[14:07.180 --> 14:09.340]  can make a sensor in soil that both
[14:09.340 --> 14:12.540]  measures carbon dioxide and oxygen
[14:12.540 --> 14:15.740]  together we can get what's called
[14:15.740 --> 14:19.660]  respiratory quotient and that tells us
[14:19.660 --> 14:22.900]  what materials are being metabolized by
[14:22.940 --> 14:26.820]  the bacteria in the soils. I'll give
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.580]  you some examples of respiratory
[14:28.580 --> 14:30.460]  quotient but here's an example of a
[14:30.460 --> 14:33.700]  bucket and some oxygen sensors and a CO2
[14:33.700 --> 14:37.660]  sensor. Remember that equation?
[14:37.660 --> 14:42.820]  There's our equation. When
[14:42.820 --> 14:45.700]  this goes that way this is one, that's one.
[14:45.700 --> 14:48.140]  That means the respiratory quotient is
[14:48.140 --> 14:51.580]  one. What if the bacteria were
[14:51.620 --> 14:57.660]  metabolizing lignin? Lignin is CH2
[14:57.660 --> 15:01.700]  with hardly any oxygen or fats. Fats
[15:01.700 --> 15:05.620]  hardly have any oxygen. Substrates change
[15:05.620 --> 15:10.660]  in the ratio of CH2O and that changes
[15:10.660 --> 15:13.860]  the ratio of CO2 and oxygen and with
[15:13.860 --> 15:15.940]  such a sensor we can tell what's being
[15:15.940 --> 15:22.330]  metabolized in the soil. Here's a couple
[15:22.810 --> 15:28.650]  of backgrounds. This is the advantage of
[15:28.650 --> 15:32.010]  measuring CO2. There's so little in the
[15:32.010 --> 15:34.250]  background it's easy to measure a change.
[15:34.250 --> 15:37.890]  I mean this is just 0.04% CO2 in the air.
[15:37.890 --> 15:39.530]  We can easily measure change. This is a
[15:39.530 --> 15:41.930]  huge background so it's hard to measure
[15:41.930 --> 15:44.890]  tiny changes in oxygen. It's easy to
[15:44.890 --> 15:51.730]  measure tiny changes in CO2. Anytime we
[15:51.730 --> 15:55.330]  do these metabolic measurements we have
[15:55.330 --> 15:58.250]  bicarbonate effects and that's a whole
[15:58.250 --> 16:00.650]  other lecture which I'm not going to
[16:00.650 --> 16:02.530]  talk about. CO2 goes in and out
[16:02.530 --> 16:06.090]  of solution and it's not metabolism and
[16:06.090 --> 16:08.170]  we've got to correct for that. Then
[16:08.170 --> 16:10.410]  oxygen is also the sensors much lower
[16:10.410 --> 16:12.970]  cost. Although we're working with some CO2
[16:12.970 --> 16:18.170]  sensors now that are we think they're
[16:18.170 --> 16:21.010]  going to be down around $300.
[16:21.010 --> 16:23.650]  The cost of CO2 sensors is
[16:23.650 --> 16:26.610]  coming down. This would normally be
[16:26.610 --> 16:30.410]  one-to-one but look at this. This is this
[16:30.410 --> 16:33.050]  respiratory quotient. Carbohydrates 1,
[16:33.050 --> 16:38.930]  proteins 0.8, fats 0.6, and lignin 0.2.
[16:38.930 --> 16:41.450]  We could begin to start to see
[16:41.450 --> 16:43.410]  what's being degraded, what type of
[16:43.410 --> 16:46.130]  material is being degraded if we can
[16:46.130 --> 16:49.410]  develop this sensor. We think this
[16:49.450 --> 16:53.610]  would sell a lot and it's one we're
[16:53.610 --> 16:56.330]  slowly working toward to develop.
[16:56.330 --> 16:59.370]  There's people at Windy
[16:59.370 --> 17:01.690]  Silver every year, how's that sensor
[17:01.690 --> 17:04.210]  coming along? She's really anxious to
[17:04.210 --> 17:06.530]  buy them as soon as you announce it.
[17:06.530 --> 17:09.930]  Here's another huge deal. We know that we
[17:09.930 --> 17:13.090]  put ammonium on, even in an ecosystem the
[17:13.090 --> 17:15.210]  degradation makes ammonium and the
[17:15.210 --> 17:18.130]  bacteria gradually oxidize this to
[17:18.130 --> 17:22.010]  nitrate. This respiratory quotient uses
[17:22.010 --> 17:24.450]  two oxygen, it doesn't make any oxygen,
[17:24.450 --> 17:27.330]  it's zero. We can begin to tell what
[17:27.330 --> 17:31.170]  forms of nitrogen the bacteria are
[17:31.170 --> 17:40.650]  utilizing in the soil. Sometimes we
[17:40.650 --> 17:42.210]  don't like to say what we're working on
[17:42.210 --> 17:44.210]  because people get so excited they want
[17:44.210 --> 17:46.090]  it to happen next year and it's way down
[17:46.090 --> 17:48.130]  the road. We have a big problem as
[17:48.130 --> 17:51.050]  our company and others of when you say
[17:51.410 --> 17:53.610]  a sensor is going to be ready because
[17:53.610 --> 17:56.290]  people get anxious to buy it.
[17:56.290 --> 17:58.330]  Sometimes you think it's going to be
[17:58.330 --> 18:00.570]  ready next month and it still takes six
[18:00.570 --> 18:05.130]  more months. You keep working
[18:05.130 --> 18:07.890]  on refining the technologies. This
[18:07.890 --> 18:11.010]  is one that's in the early idea
[18:11.010 --> 18:17.050]  stages. That's one of my favorite slides
[18:17.210 --> 18:21.370]  but I'm going to conclude with that. I
[18:21.370 --> 18:24.570]  hope this gets you excited about making
[18:24.570 --> 18:26.450]  more measurements with more kinds of
[18:26.450 --> 18:30.170]  sensors. It's a joy to collect
[18:30.170 --> 18:32.610]  data and you know how the world
[18:32.610 --> 18:34.250]  is supposed to work and then you try and
[18:34.250 --> 18:35.690]  measure it and see if it really works
[18:35.690 --> 18:39.690]  like that. Linking back to those very
[18:39.690 --> 18:42.810]  first quotes I showed, if theory and
[18:42.810 --> 18:46.250]  measurement don't agree you got a red
[18:46.250 --> 18:49.490]  light. The amazing thing is
[18:49.490 --> 18:51.770]  the theory is wrong sometimes and your
[18:51.770 --> 18:54.730]  measurements are rock-solid and you
[18:54.730 --> 18:56.770]  can get a Nobel Prize for
[18:56.770 --> 18:59.770]  overturning some things we thought we
[18:59.770 --> 19:01.930]  knew that we really don't know so well.
[19:01.930 --> 19:05.850]  After all that's what research is.
[19:05.850 --> 19:09.370]  Researching takes stuff we thought we
[19:09.370 --> 19:11.530]  knew and see if we really know it.
[19:11.530 --> 19:14.890]  That's a huge danger of if we
[19:14.890 --> 19:16.930]  think we know something and we're pretty
[19:16.930 --> 19:19.090]  sure we know it and we're wrong. That's
[19:19.090 --> 19:21.330]  one of the worst problems of all of
[19:21.330 --> 19:25.290]  science. With measurements getting
[19:25.290 --> 19:27.570]  better and better and better we can
[19:27.570 --> 19:30.250]  revisit some things that we thought we
[19:30.250 --> 19:35.490]  knew. I hope you get an opportunity to
[19:35.490 --> 19:39.850]  use these instruments in your
[19:39.850 --> 19:43.650]  research and all your endeavors.
[19:43.650 --> 19:46.090]  We look forward to the potential of
[19:46.090 --> 19:51.490]  working for you.
