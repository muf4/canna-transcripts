[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  Hello, my name is Ben Crabb. I do technical sales and support here at Apogee Instruments.
[00:04.080 --> 00:10.400]  I'm here today to talk to you about a set of new coefficients that we have for our MC100
[00:10.400 --> 00:14.040]  chlorophyll concentration meter. We actually have two different sets, two new sets, two
[00:14.040 --> 00:18.800]  new species that we can measure accurately, cannabis and grapes. And so I'll briefly go
[00:18.800 --> 00:23.640]  over how this meter takes measurements of absolute chlorophyll concentration, and then
[00:23.640 --> 00:28.560]  we'll go into how to get those new coefficients, select them, and start taking measurements.
[00:28.560 --> 00:34.160]  So very briefly, the operation of this meter is based on the transmittance of light at
[00:34.160 --> 00:43.380]  red and near-infrared wavelengths through a plant leaf. This item has two LEDs in it,
[00:43.380 --> 00:49.120]  one of which emits light in a red wavelength of 653 nanometers. The other one emits light
[00:49.120 --> 00:55.200]  in a near-infrared wavelength of 931 nanometers. Now the red wavelength, the plants can use
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.200]  that type of light for photosynthesis, and so most of that light gets absorbed and used
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.240]  by the leaf. Light at the longer near-infrared wavelengths can't be used by the plant, and
[01:05.240 --> 01:09.420]  so it will just pass through the leaf and the leaf doesn't do much with it, or it gets
[01:09.420 --> 01:15.820]  reflected off. And so we can derive this CCI value, this chlorophyll concentration index
[01:15.820 --> 01:20.880]  or chlorophyll content index, as the ratio of transmission values at the near-infrared
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.680]  wavelengths and the red wavelength. And so in this example shown, we have a CCI value of about
[01:26.680 --> 01:34.960]  7.5. And so this is a nice relative indication, but it's unitless, and one of the great advantages
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.160]  of this meter is that it will convert that unitless measure into a measure of absolute
[01:39.160 --> 01:46.080]  chlorophyll. And the way we do that is we follow a methodology, a method outlined in this academic
[01:46.080 --> 01:52.480]  paper, In-Situ Measurement of Leaf Chlorophyll Concentration, Analysis of the Optical-Absolute
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.880]  Relationship. This was published by Christopher Perry, Mark Blonquist, Bruce Bugbee in 2014.
[01:56.880 --> 02:04.320]  And you can read it at your leisure if you'd like. In the paper, they correlate that CCI value to
[02:04.320 --> 02:12.800]  the quantity of chlorophyll in the leaf, which they derive using laboratory techniques. They do
[02:12.800 --> 02:20.360]  this for 22 or 23 different species, all of which have coefficients loaded onto our meter. Here's a
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.600]  brief look at the results of their paper. On the x-axis, we have the CCI values, those unitless
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.240]  values. On the y-axis, we have chlorophyll concentration measurements in absolute values
[02:30.240 --> 02:37.280]  of micromoles per meter squared. And so you can see that there's a positive relationship, but it's
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.960]  not perfectly linear. It's not a straight line. There's a little bit of a curve to it, and there's
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.120]  a little bit of difference depending on the species that you're using. Each of these different
[02:45.120 --> 02:51.200]  colored lines correlates to a different type of plant. And then on the bottom panel, we have the
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.720]  curve for the general set of coefficients that you could use if you're studying a plant that is
[02:55.720 --> 03:01.600]  not included in this list. Here's another look at those type of curves. This comes out of our
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.880]  owner's manual, and we just show wheat, rice, and corn. Again, they're similar, but not precisely
[03:06.880 --> 03:15.000]  the same. So it's nice to have a curve particular to your species. Now this video is inspired by our
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.040]  new cannabis coefficients as well as grape coefficients. Here's a look at the new cannabis
[03:19.040 --> 03:25.080]  coefficients in green compared to wheat and the general set of coefficients. And you can see that
[03:25.080 --> 03:32.360]  cannabis has a different shape to it. For the same CCI value, CCI values on the x-axis down here,
[03:32.360 --> 03:37.880]  and absolute chlorophyll on the y-axis. So for the same CCI value, it's about almost a two times
[03:37.880 --> 03:45.200]  difference, 1.8 times difference between cannabis and wheat. If you're looking at the same chlorophyll
[03:45.200 --> 03:52.520]  value, it's about a two and a half times difference in CCI. And so this new set of coefficients will
[03:52.520 --> 04:00.000]  be great for our cannabis customers. So now we're at the part where I'll go over very quickly how
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.240]  to get those coefficients, load them onto your meter, select them, and take measurements. We will
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.800]  download the coefficients from our website. We will connect this to our computer using a little
[04:10.800 --> 04:17.440]  USB cord it came with. We'll drag the new files onto the folder that shows up from this MC100.
[04:17.440 --> 04:23.240]  We'll disconnect it, then we'll navigate to the coefficients on the screen here, and then you can
[04:23.240 --> 04:26.920]  start taking measurements. And it's just pushing down this arm with the leaf in between.
