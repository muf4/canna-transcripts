[00:00.000 --> 00:10.800]  This is day two of approximately an eight series lectures of the energy
[00:10.800 --> 00:17.240]  balance principles. I want to review today a little bit of where we got
[00:17.240 --> 00:21.120]  yesterday just very quickly and that's why I did not erase the board because we
[00:21.120 --> 00:26.680]  can put it up here. The key take-home message from yesterday is we're
[00:26.680 --> 00:32.720]  measuring radiation and then through this latent heat of evaporation we can
[00:32.720 --> 00:40.960]  calculate how much water would have to evaporate to balance this. We go to
[00:40.960 --> 00:47.280]  a volume of water and then multiply by area depth of water, which the depth of
[00:47.280 --> 00:52.760]  water is typically the irrigation that we tell people to put on. How many
[00:52.760 --> 00:58.000]  millimeters a day or how many inches a day should you be putting on to balance
[00:58.000 --> 01:08.160]  this equation. The key point we got to is if we measure 30 megajoules a day,
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.800]  which yesterday we got 30 megajoules, today we're going to get 30 megajoules,
[01:13.800 --> 01:21.200]  it's a clear day, it's summer. If all of that was absorbed we would have to
[01:21.240 --> 01:29.400]  evaporate 12 liters of water per meter squared every day. 12 liters of water.
[01:29.400 --> 01:37.640]  I always think about a meter squared. This tabletop is probably not close to a
[01:37.640 --> 01:45.200]  meter squared, but that is a lot of water. It's worth remembering because of
[01:45.200 --> 01:57.120]  these volume and depth things, 12 liters of water is 1.2 centimeters of water per
[01:57.120 --> 02:06.280]  day. Then the meter squared, the depth cancels. It's possible to get
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.320]  conditions where you have to evaporate 1.2 centimeters of water a day to
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.280]  balance this, but this is an extraordinary amount of water. As we
[02:15.280 --> 02:20.240]  pointed out the other day, we get more like half of this. Now we have a case
[02:20.240 --> 02:27.760]  where something's wrong. The typical measured evaporation is only half of
[02:27.760 --> 02:33.280]  what we calculated. Either the model is wrong or the measurements are wrong.
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.000]  Like all science, when we start out with this we don't know which one's wrong.
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.680]  We go back and look at the measurements. We go back and look at the model.
[02:42.680 --> 02:51.160]  In this case, the model is not sufficiently detailed to calculate
[02:51.160 --> 02:57.600]  absorbed radiation. I purposely did a very simple model yesterday and
[02:57.600 --> 03:04.120]  assumed if 30 comes in, every speck of that is absorbed and evaporates water.
[03:04.840 --> 03:12.280]  That never happens. We never get a hundred percent absorption. I want to
[03:12.280 --> 03:21.000]  start by dividing this up. Before I talk about that, yesterday we talked
[03:21.000 --> 03:31.240]  about Einstein's p and how much energy you get from this thing. I don't think I
[03:31.280 --> 03:37.000]  made copies of this, but I will and you can have them. Here's the math of this,
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.160]  the key for this thing. Zoom out just a little bit.
[03:45.680 --> 03:52.600]  The answer, depending on exactly how big you assume that p is, is 6,000 years.
[03:52.600 --> 04:00.440]  In perfect SI units it's more like six kiloyears, using the right prefix.
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.600]  It's a good chance you're going to die from something else before you run out
[04:04.600 --> 04:10.800]  of energy in that p. It's a pretty simple calculation. Here's the
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.800]  dimensional analysis of it showing energy kilograms per meter second
[04:16.800 --> 04:25.080]  squared times a meter is a joule. A joule is a Newton per meter. When you
[04:25.080 --> 04:31.240]  work through this you get a good sense of the units for energy. I'll
[04:31.240 --> 04:39.400]  give you a copy of this. This is a good time to point out one of the reasons for
[04:39.400 --> 04:48.880]  using SI units. When students do this calculation in class, they frequently get
[04:48.880 --> 04:54.640]  it wrong by a factor of a thousand. Where's the error?
[04:54.640 --> 05:00.440]  It's wrong by a factor of a thousand. It's hard to tell because you might
[05:00.440 --> 05:08.640]  get such a long time anyway. The place that people make the error, and now I
[05:08.640 --> 05:17.230]  need to create a little bit of room here. I'm going to blame this on the
[05:17.230 --> 05:21.470]  nutrition and food science people because they got it all
[05:21.470 --> 05:26.510]  screwed up. What do they use for energy? How many calories should you eat per day?
[05:26.510 --> 05:43.250]  You should eat so many calories per day. They capitalize the word calories
[05:43.250 --> 05:49.170]  and they say when it's capitalized it means a thousand calories. Nobody
[05:49.170 --> 05:53.130]  else does that. You don't capitalize words and multiply by a thousand, except
[05:53.130 --> 06:04.090]  they do. A calorie spelled with a capital C is equal to a thousand
[06:04.090 --> 06:12.770]  calories spelled with a lowercase c. That trips people up all the time in
[06:12.770 --> 06:24.370]  this. We need 2,400 kilocalories a day. We should get rid of this
[06:24.370 --> 06:30.370]  capitalized C, but this is a big problem. It's on cereal boxes and it's everywhere
[06:30.370 --> 06:35.090]  and you just got to know that when you capitalize that word it's worth a
[06:35.090 --> 06:43.690]  thousand times more. Interestingly enough, when you do this math, our energy
[06:43.690 --> 06:48.410]  requirements, 4.18 kilojoules per kilocalorie.
[06:48.410 --> 06:55.250]  Look that conversion up. We need about 10 megajoules a day for energy for
[06:55.250 --> 06:59.650]  a typical person. That's an easy number to remember, 10 megajoules.
[06:59.650 --> 07:04.250]  Now you could start to think about everything in megajoules and stuff
[07:04.410 --> 07:14.050]  starts to line up. I'll give you a copy of this. It's just a helpful
[07:14.050 --> 07:22.570]  introduction to units. I also want to say one other introductory thing. I
[07:22.570 --> 07:33.170]  didn't mention this yesterday, but at the university we have a requirement for
[07:33.290 --> 07:41.650]  competency in writing for graduate students. American students don't have a
[07:41.650 --> 07:45.450]  problem with near-native fluency, but foreign students we ask them to write an
[07:45.450 --> 07:52.330]  essay about something to show that they have good command of English. They take
[07:52.330 --> 07:58.410]  this TOEFL test and other things, but this is an essay which I'm going to hand
[07:58.410 --> 08:03.690]  out. You could take a copy of it. It's a short essay. It was written by a woman
[08:03.690 --> 08:10.890]  from China. I was on her committee. I thought this is one of the best
[08:10.890 --> 08:17.530]  written essays that I'd ever seen by a foreign student. It's about, as you
[08:17.530 --> 08:21.530]  can see, differences in the educational system between the United States and
[08:21.530 --> 08:26.850]  China. She talks about her experiences in China where memorization is prized.
[08:26.850 --> 08:31.890]  If you can recite things and memorize them, you're just promoted. You're a
[08:31.890 --> 08:41.130]  genius. Minimal effort to apply the knowledge in creative ways. She said
[08:41.130 --> 08:46.290]  I was amazed. Here people gave me a page of notes for exams. I didn't have to
[08:46.290 --> 08:51.570]  memorize. I just had to learn how to apply the information. So, we aspire
[08:51.570 --> 08:57.770]  to help people understand how to apply the information rather than memorizing
[08:57.770 --> 09:05.050]  it because you can look stuff up in a book. Memorization is not a goal of
[09:05.050 --> 09:13.290]  our education, except in some cases where I guess in the third and fourth
[09:13.290 --> 09:18.050]  grade we memorize addition tables. I don't know if you memorize those or
[09:18.050 --> 09:23.490]  figure them out, but kids have to pass multiplication tables.
[09:23.490 --> 09:29.890]  Beyond that, we're always looking at how to apply stuff. So, this is a nice
[09:29.890 --> 09:37.090]  essay. It's short and I was really touched by it. It's part of the
[09:37.090 --> 09:41.130]  reason the world comes to the United States to study because of our approach
[09:41.130 --> 09:46.010]  to education. Trying to apply the principles rather than just memorizing
[09:46.010 --> 09:58.770]  the principles. Now let's get back to this radiation. Now I can start to
[09:58.770 --> 10:05.690]  erase the stuff from yesterday. We're going to keep. So, speaking of memorization,
[10:05.690 --> 10:10.450]  this is a good number. You can have it on a card in your pocket or something, but
[10:10.450 --> 10:16.090]  this is a good number to remember because it's quickly energy and
[10:16.250 --> 10:22.130]  volume of water. We go back and forth between those units and it's worth
[10:22.130 --> 10:34.180]  mentioning. Let's see, I'm going to keep going here. We don't always use liters but of
[10:34.180 --> 10:44.980]  course 2.45 kilojoules per milliliter. Dividing numerator and denominator by a
[10:44.980 --> 10:50.020]  thousand. Once you get it memorized, you can quickly switch. Of course a
[10:50.020 --> 10:58.220]  millimeter is a gram of water. It's a cubic centimeter of water. That's
[10:58.220 --> 11:03.180]  just switching units quickly back and forth. In my experience, I found
[11:03.180 --> 11:07.380]  it useful. I'm using this number so much I can flip the units in my head pretty
[11:07.380 --> 11:13.060]  fast to fit the question that's being asked. What volume of water is evaporated?
[11:13.540 --> 11:21.020]  Alright, we get calories figured out. We're going to leave our leaf right there.
[11:21.020 --> 11:33.060]  Everyone's committed this to memory. Now we got our units conversion.
[11:33.060 --> 11:43.140]  Before I get into separating this, I thought of working this out as a
[11:43.140 --> 11:51.740]  quantitative example of how do we calculate this 5%. I drew this and I
[11:51.740 --> 11:56.820]  got an example for you. I'm going to give you a handout on this because everything is
[11:56.940 --> 12:07.220]  quantitative and calculated. Here's the energy in. Here's photosynthesis
[12:08.500 --> 12:24.100]  abbreviated. My example goes up to full sunlight, 1000 watts per meter
[12:24.220 --> 12:32.980]  squared. We do our curve on here. It looks something like this. Now we clamp on a leaf
[12:32.980 --> 12:39.540]  with a photosynthesis system. I call them clamp-on chambers. You can
[12:39.540 --> 12:44.140]  measure, quickly measure, the photosynthesis of a leaf. We get points
[12:44.140 --> 12:52.180]  in this curve. What do we get out here? What's the photosynthesis? A typical
[12:52.180 --> 13:04.300]  rate is 30. This has units of micromoles of carbon per meter squared per second
[13:04.300 --> 13:13.980]  of leaf. Down here we have a thousand joules per meter squared per second.
[13:13.980 --> 13:19.180]  Same thing. The meter squared per second perfectly lines up. Now we can
[13:19.180 --> 13:25.820]  calculate efficiency of photosynthesis with appropriate units conversion in
[13:25.820 --> 13:40.620]  this. Energy in, energy out. Efficiency is output over input.
[13:40.620 --> 13:50.860]  Real simple, we've just got to get these in the same units so we can make this
[13:50.860 --> 14:07.860]  calculation. If we have, let's go over here, output out in 1000 watt. I'm going to
[14:07.860 --> 14:21.580]  skip right to 1000 joules per meter squared per second. 30 micromoles of what
[14:21.580 --> 14:29.060]  we measure is CO2 disappearing per meter squared per second.
[14:29.060 --> 14:35.700]  Obviously our meter squared and our seconds are gone. The output is
[14:35.860 --> 14:41.580]  moles of CO2 that have gone into the leaf and the input is joules of energy.
[14:41.580 --> 14:52.100]  We can't do an efficiency yet. We've got to get this in units of energy. From our
[14:52.100 --> 15:02.740]  equation which I wrote up here, CO2 becomes CH2O. I'll put all of it up here.
[15:02.980 --> 15:12.340]  Water plus oxygen. This is elegant because one mole of CO2 becomes one mole
[15:12.340 --> 15:20.180]  of carbohydrate over here. We're measuring the uptake of CO2 but we know
[15:20.180 --> 15:27.340]  there's a one-to-one relationship with moles of carbon that disappear and moles
[15:27.340 --> 15:36.020]  of carbon that are fixed in sugar in the leaf. Now we can take this times the
[15:36.020 --> 15:53.380]  joules of energy in a mole of carbon. I'm going to just say a mole of CH2O.
[15:53.380 --> 16:03.380]  With this the numerator becomes joules and the denominator becomes joules.
[16:03.380 --> 16:13.700]  This is a number you can look up in a book, the energy in sucrose. This is 480
[16:13.700 --> 16:21.700]  kilojoules per mole of CH2O. I'm going to give you a handout here to make sure I get the
[16:21.700 --> 16:32.100]  units right. This is micromoles so now we're keeping track of this. 30 x 10 to
[16:32.100 --> 16:41.460]  the minus 6 moles times this and now the moles cancel. 30 x 480. I'm going to write that down here.
[16:41.460 --> 17:02.660]  30 x 480. I've got to keep track of the prefix. This is 14.4 joules. The units come from up here.
[17:02.660 --> 17:13.140]  Divided by a thousand joules of energy it took to fix that amount of
[17:13.140 --> 17:27.500]  carbohydrate. Photosynthesis in full sunlight of a healthy leaf, everything
[17:27.500 --> 17:38.460]  going for it, 1-2%. That 5% is even a little high average for most leaves. It can only get to 5% in
[17:38.460 --> 17:45.100]  lower light levels. Most of these calculations were doing high light. That's why we say we can
[17:45.820 --> 17:53.340]  ignore photosynthesis. Here's what I just wrote on the board in a
[17:57.500 --> 18:04.140]  worked out example with this. There's the efficiency and down here 1.44.
[18:05.100 --> 18:11.900]  Now right away I made a mistake I tell people never to do. This model has
[18:12.780 --> 18:18.940]  really assumed inputs. We're assuming 30 and then I wrote the answer to three significant digits.
[18:20.300 --> 18:27.980]  I should really say one to two or something down here. We all do that and it helps to show that
[18:28.780 --> 18:34.140]  this implies you can make quite a precise calculation and you can if you have accurate.
[18:34.860 --> 18:38.940]  If you knew this was precisely a thousand and you knew that was precisely 30.
[18:39.900 --> 18:46.540]  The point of this is it's not difficult to calculate the energy going into photosynthesis.
[18:49.580 --> 18:56.540]  Now let's focus on this radiation component here. Since we all got the hand down and it's up here
[18:58.540 --> 19:02.300]  take this off, take photosynthesis off.
[19:02.700 --> 19:20.980]  There's one other aspect of modeling that's significant here. You could say and people do,
[19:21.940 --> 19:30.180]  wait a minute we can measure photosynthesis. I'll change this now to two percent and maybe this is
[19:30.180 --> 19:35.940]  more like one percent for respiration. People say well wait a minute we can measure that.
[19:35.940 --> 19:42.100]  We can put it in the model. Every time you add coefficients to the model and add complexity
[19:42.660 --> 19:47.220]  you have a greater chance of making errors on the primary thing. It's kind of like writing down
[19:47.220 --> 19:52.980]  significant digits. If you get too worried about the third or fourth significant digit in a model
[19:53.860 --> 20:01.460]  you can make errors on the big picture thing. In my experience it's a lot better to get the big
[20:01.460 --> 20:08.340]  numbers correct and really analyze them and don't worry about the small stuff until you really need
[20:08.340 --> 20:14.180]  to. Until you're really trying to get three or four significant digits in the answer.
[20:17.380 --> 20:25.620]  This little graph is worth really remembering both the peak of the day and the integrated total.
[20:26.340 --> 20:33.540]  Because we go back and forth between a daily total for transpiration and an instantaneous value.
[20:33.540 --> 20:42.500]  When our instruments calculate this we do this in one hour time steps. We do each number in here
[20:42.500 --> 20:48.900]  and it's also possible to just integrate the whole day, but our data acquisition systems do one hour
[20:48.900 --> 20:57.140]  time steps. Now I'm going to focus on a thousand watts in of shortwave radiation.
[20:58.740 --> 21:04.900]  We're going to model like one hour near solar noon when we have a thousand watts in.
[21:05.620 --> 21:09.540]  This thousand watts,
[21:12.980 --> 21:27.300]  I think I can model this to keep my same leaf diagram up here. Here's the sun
[21:27.860 --> 21:34.580]  and we got to have some appropriate color for the sun.
[21:36.260 --> 21:43.940]  As every school kid knows this is the appropriate anatomy for the sun. The sun's coming in
[21:44.740 --> 21:53.140]  and we have a thousand watts per meter squared hitting that leaf. We'll say this is a
[21:53.140 --> 22:00.420]  one meter squared leaf. If you hold the leaf to the sun you can see light coming through it.
[22:01.140 --> 22:08.500]  Light goes through leaves so it's not all absorbed. If you hold the leaf like this and look at it,
[22:08.500 --> 22:14.340]  you can see light bouncing off it. Light's reflected and transmitted
[22:14.340 --> 22:23.620]  and we only have to evaporate enough water to account for what's absorbed by this leaf.
[22:25.060 --> 22:33.220]  We know from lots of years of measurements on leaves, they're all very similar
[22:34.100 --> 22:41.460]  with the exception of really thick leaves like maybe a cactus. Of that thousand
[22:41.620 --> 22:57.220]  about 25% bounces off and about 25% is transmitted.
[23:04.940 --> 23:11.980]  Suddenly, remember our model and we are off by a factor of two between the actual
[23:12.860 --> 23:19.740]  evaporation of water and the input. Just with this simple analysis, if only half
[23:20.940 --> 23:31.420]  is absorbed by the leaf. Remember we had on one side 1.2 centimeters a day
[23:32.780 --> 23:39.340]  and then over here we had 0.6 centimeters a day. This is the measured from pan evaporation.
[23:39.900 --> 23:47.180]  All of a sudden, if only half is absorbed, our two sides of our model line up.
[23:49.100 --> 23:56.460]  We're not done. Suddenly there's a big difference and all we've done so far is
[23:56.460 --> 24:07.340]  account for absorbed radiation. This term when I just said radiation in a generic sense
[24:09.820 --> 24:21.260]  this has to be R for radiation absorbed by the leaf. Now equals T plus C squared.
[24:21.260 --> 24:30.780]  Now our challenge is to calculate the absorbed radiation by a single leaf or by a community.
[24:31.820 --> 24:38.380]  This is applied to anything. I mean your car parked in the sun, we're calculating absorbed
[24:38.380 --> 24:44.940]  radiation to do this. But it's a key first step because you can see from this the absorbed can be
[24:44.940 --> 24:55.340]  half of what's incident. It's not difficult to measure the incident coming in. These are a
[24:55.340 --> 25:02.860]  little harder. We model them and we measure them both depending on the situation.
[25:03.660 --> 25:15.180]  Let's take this 25% reflected.
[25:19.260 --> 25:27.260]  When we calculate energy balance for the planet Earth, for anything, we're measuring reflected
[25:27.260 --> 25:34.780]  radiation. You can look up characteristic reflectances of surfaces, all kinds of surfaces.
[25:35.340 --> 25:39.020]  You can look up a piece of white paper, you can look up a piece of black paper.
[25:41.580 --> 25:49.660]  Because this is so common in calculations, we got a unique name for it, albedo.
[25:50.460 --> 26:01.100]  That's the fraction of reflected radiation.
[26:10.880 --> 26:20.320]  We've just said for a typical leaf, 25% as a round number.
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.880]  Let's say what's the albedo of a black piece of paper?
[26:30.240 --> 26:36.960]  Black paper, if I drew a little thing and colored it in all black,
[26:40.560 --> 26:47.440]  it's about 10%. Albedo is
[26:48.240 --> 26:57.040]  expressed typically as a decimal fraction, not as a percent. Black paper, 0.1. White paper,
[27:02.900 --> 27:11.380]  maybe 0.9. There's some pretty extremes and leaves are in the middle. Some are around 25%.
[27:12.340 --> 27:25.940]  I have a handout showing typical values for
[27:29.700 --> 27:35.060]  some common surfaces.
[27:35.060 --> 27:38.980]  Let's see if we can get that on there nice and straight.
[27:43.860 --> 27:52.180]  Here's white paper and black paper. This is really black paper. I put 0.05. This paper
[27:52.180 --> 27:59.860]  might be sort of charcoal if it got up to 0.1. This paper, well I had super white paper here
[27:59.860 --> 28:06.180]  and this was a little off-white, so it's 0.8. You get the idea. Never mind this column just yet.
[28:06.180 --> 28:13.860]  We're going to get to that. Here's a flat leaf, 25%. Now, plant community. If a leaf is 25%,
[28:14.420 --> 28:20.020]  okay fine, but now a plant community, we got leaves at all kinds of angles and the light
[28:20.020 --> 28:28.500]  bounces around. Typically, a plant community is a little bit less than a single leaf because of
[28:28.500 --> 28:34.740]  vertical leaves and bouncing. It absorbs the light slightly better. Aluminum foil,
[28:36.020 --> 28:41.380]  up there pretty close to white paper. They both reflect light pretty well. In fact,
[28:44.020 --> 28:48.500]  I've been in a lot of discussions with growth chamber manufacturers. What's the best color
[28:48.500 --> 28:54.260]  for the inside of a growth chamber? Should it be reflective mylar or should it be white?
[28:54.580 --> 29:03.460]  It's pretty academic. They're both about the same. Human skin, that's a good comparison.
[29:04.980 --> 29:13.780]  50% reflectance from our skin, which brings me to an interesting sidebar.
[29:14.340 --> 29:26.240]  This little graph is an example out of Campbell and Norman's book,
[29:30.080 --> 29:38.640]  Environmental Biophysics. This is a person in Antarctica. The energy balance of a person in
[29:38.640 --> 29:44.480]  Antarctica, how big of a coat do they have to wear? Here you get to go out and say, it's a
[29:44.480 --> 29:49.280]  little chilly, I'll go change clothes. Antarctica, you have to know how cold it's going to be.
[29:50.480 --> 29:55.360]  What color should the coat be? What's the energy balance of the person working outside in
[29:55.360 --> 30:01.440]  a super cold condition? Here's his chest in the sun and he's in the shade. I won't go through
[30:01.440 --> 30:07.040]  all the details, but there's an application of energy balance. Now let's take that to the limit.
[30:07.920 --> 30:13.600]  I've had the wonderful experience of working with NASA people and listening to lots of seminars.
[30:14.240 --> 30:20.880]  Now we're going to have a person go into outer space on an extravehicular trip and you don't
[30:20.880 --> 30:26.400]  get to go say, it's a little chilly, I'll come in and put on thicker gloves. They have to know
[30:27.200 --> 30:32.480]  how that person's going to work. Imagine getting every single finger at just the right temperature
[30:32.480 --> 30:39.280]  in this suit and the physics are different. There's no air, so conduction and convection is zero
[30:39.600 --> 30:46.080]  and there's no transpiration. They have to do everything by radiation balance. These numbers
[30:46.080 --> 30:53.520]  are both zero, so the radiation in has to equal the radiation out for this space suit.
[30:55.120 --> 31:00.560]  That's true if you're on the surface of the moon, there's no air. This is all
[31:00.560 --> 31:08.000]  radiation balance. That's just an interesting example of applications of these
[31:08.800 --> 31:18.080]  principles. Snow is a big deal. Look, fresh clean snow as soon as it gets a little old,
[31:18.080 --> 31:24.000]  it drops off. That has a lot to do with hydrology and calculating how fast the snow is going to
[31:24.000 --> 31:30.560]  melt in the spring and come down. How white is the snow? It doesn't take much to drop that
[31:30.560 --> 31:35.440]  albedo of the snow and this drops 10% more energy is going into the snow.
[31:35.680 --> 31:45.040]  This also brings us to a theoretically perfect black body, which is a black disc.
[31:45.040 --> 31:52.320]  That has an albedo by definition of 0.00. If it's theoretically perfect, you could put
[31:52.320 --> 31:59.920]  10 zeros on this. It'd still be at zero. Our radiometers are designed to have a black disc
[31:59.920 --> 32:04.880]  that's as close to theoretically perfect as possible. You look at that little black disc,
[32:05.760 --> 32:10.000]  and it's supposed to look like it's a hollow cavity. There's nothing there. You could put
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.840]  your finger in the hole. If we had a theoretically perfect black body here, it would look like some
[32:15.840 --> 32:20.720]  giant tube that was like a black hole. It'd look like you could put your hand right in it because
[32:20.720 --> 32:28.320]  there's nothing there. It's rare we ever get anything that good, but we aspire to make this
[32:28.320 --> 32:32.080]  albedo of those black surfaces as close to zero as possible.
[32:35.440 --> 32:41.280]  We're coming to this, and I'm going to come to this in a minute. There's the concept of albedo.
[32:42.240 --> 32:48.800]  It's easy to look up the internet about albedos for all kinds of surfaces. Because this is such
[32:48.800 --> 33:08.630]  a big deal. Here's a pyranometer measuring sun in. If we take one like this,
[33:11.830 --> 33:19.270]  we can measure reflected out. This instrument with one turned upside down is called an albedo meter.
[33:19.670 --> 33:29.110]  You can purchase these and characterize surfaces. For double the money, you can measure it.
[33:29.110 --> 33:34.070]  If you don't have a lot of money, you model it. It's a critical parameter.
[33:35.030 --> 33:36.790]  Fraction of reflected radiation.
[33:53.340 --> 34:05.740]  Let me move now from, I'm going to erase this albedo because we've all got that nailed.
[34:05.900 --> 34:18.900]  The albedo meter. Now let's break down radiation
[34:24.180 --> 34:36.100]  absorbed equals radiation in times albedo.
[34:36.420 --> 34:46.260]  Let me take one more step here. Radiation short wave, sw,
[34:51.940 --> 34:54.740]  in times albedo.
[34:55.700 --> 35:11.300]  This other marker is slightly better. Times albedo is radiation short wave absorbed.
[35:12.100 --> 35:18.820]  I'm going to give you a handout that shows this all worked out. We got one component of this for
[35:19.700 --> 35:30.900]  absorbed radiation. In a single leaf albedo is only this fraction here.
[35:33.620 --> 35:42.260]  We need to put a number in here that accounts for both absorbed and transmitted.
[35:43.220 --> 35:54.900]  Typically, we have radiation short wave in or incident radiation times. The number we're
[35:54.900 --> 36:04.100]  going to put in here is 0.5 because it accounts for both transmission and incident.
[36:17.690 --> 36:19.130]  It's fraction reflected.
[36:27.380 --> 36:35.300]  Now we got 50 percent absorbed. If we're going to assume this 1000 coming in here,
[36:36.260 --> 36:48.100]  if this one's a thousand times 0.5, now we have absorbed radiation and 500 watts per meter squared.
[36:49.060 --> 36:58.580]  We have not yet done long wave radiation, but this is the powerhouse of the short wave
[36:58.580 --> 37:01.700]  coming in from the Sun at solar noon.
[37:07.900 --> 37:14.700]  There's one thing that we typically add to this to make the model a bit more accurate. You can
[37:15.580 --> 37:25.100]  you can ignore this, but almost always there is additional radiation
[37:27.100 --> 37:29.180]  coming into that leaf from reflection.
[37:34.540 --> 37:41.180]  It comes off of clouds and bounces on the leaf and it comes off the ground and bounces on the
[37:41.180 --> 37:51.260]  leaf. In this case, if we're assuming a leaf over ground, especially wet ground, moist soil,
[37:52.380 --> 38:03.180]  10 percent. If that albedo is 10 percent, if it's moist soil, now we have a thousand coming in,
[38:03.180 --> 38:09.500]  10 percent, 100 watts per meter squared.
[38:11.100 --> 38:19.820]  500 plus radiation shortwave reflected.
[38:26.890 --> 38:32.090]  Now we have 600 watts per meter squared of radiation coming in on this leaf to deal with.
[38:32.170 --> 38:37.050]  It's either going to heat the leaf up or evaporate water.
[38:38.570 --> 38:41.850]  This is the end of the shortwave radiation.
[38:46.570 --> 38:53.370]  As soon as these leaves cover the ground, this reflection goes to virtually zero.
[38:54.330 --> 39:07.130]  I still put this in as a component because if there's clouds next to the Sun, it easily can get 10 percent off the clouds.
[39:07.130 --> 39:12.570]  It can come from cloud. Another way I might have drawn this,
[39:13.610 --> 39:20.170]  different arrow, but here's a cloud over here. I could have drawn it like that and it's still
[39:20.170 --> 39:27.210]  reflection. That would be the case for a full canopy. This goes to zero, which allows me to
[39:27.210 --> 39:36.410]  make a key point here. Lots of people panic when they find their radiation measurements
[39:37.050 --> 39:43.690]  go above a thousand. You just told me a thousand is clear Sun at solar noon and I've been getting
[39:43.690 --> 39:49.850]  1300. Your instrument must be wrong. Is it a partly cloudy day? Well yeah.
[39:50.570 --> 39:59.770]  Are the clouds on the size of the Sun? Yeah. Okay, we have seen 30 as high as 30 percent
[39:59.770 --> 40:06.090]  reflected off of clouds. That's really high, but 10 percent off of clouds happens all the time.
[40:06.090 --> 40:10.170]  So all of a sudden their measurements spike and there's nothing wrong with the instrument.
[40:10.170 --> 40:19.450]  It's reflection off of clouds. After we drill people about a clear sky number, we often fail
[40:19.450 --> 40:24.330]  to tell them that it can be higher than clear sky when the clouds are like a lens and they
[40:24.330 --> 40:30.250]  focus it. Of course that also has to do with people setting a range of their data logger. You want to
[40:30.250 --> 40:34.410]  make sure your data logger is capable of measuring numbers higher than a thousand.
[40:34.970 --> 40:44.410]  This is the story with shortwave radiation from the measurement of incident in to absorbed.
[40:44.410 --> 40:50.730]  In this particular example we get a thousand in and six hundreds absorbed.
[40:51.770 --> 40:56.970]  Now obviously this can vary, but it's an example and it's
[40:57.690 --> 41:03.370]  roughly half to two-thirds of the total coming in.
[41:04.410 --> 41:14.570]  This is only shortwave radiation, which is the energy coming from the Sun.
[41:14.730 --> 41:25.330]  When we look at, let me draw this up here,
[41:27.570 --> 41:31.650]  if we put the blinds down in this room so no shortwave came in,
[41:33.570 --> 41:41.090]  we would still have fluxes of longwave radiation. Longwave radiation comes from warm objects,
[41:41.650 --> 41:49.010]  not as hot as the Sun, but warm objects. It's proportional to the temperature of the objects.
[41:51.810 --> 41:59.250]  If you have two objects in outer space, no air, no transpiration, and one's hotter than the other,
[41:59.970 --> 42:06.370]  that energy is going to move by longwave radiation from the hot one to the cold. These are
[42:06.930 --> 42:13.010]  hundreds of watts per meter squared of energy transfer by longwave radiation that we haven't
[42:13.010 --> 42:44.700]  yet accounted for in this. We need to add that in. Let's see what I have for typically in the book.
[42:45.100 --> 42:51.900]  In the chapter 7 that I'm following from this, you can see graphs in there. I'll put this graph
[42:51.900 --> 43:02.300]  over here. Let me erase this and put the graph right here. We're still at radiation absorbed.
[43:02.860 --> 43:18.700]  Now we're going to do electromagnetic spectrum. Over here is 400 and 700. This whole thing is
[43:18.700 --> 43:28.460]  in nanometers of the wavelength. This is photosynthetic radiation which we'll come to.
[43:29.420 --> 43:39.100]  If we make a curve of the energy from the Sun, it looks something like this. This is shortwave.
[43:44.300 --> 43:48.380]  This looks like this above the Earth's atmosphere. There's no absorption bands in
[43:48.380 --> 44:00.380]  this yet for water vapor and CO2. Out here we get a curve that looks something like that.
[44:01.980 --> 44:06.700]  Less intensity but a really long area and this is longwave.
[44:07.580 --> 44:14.620]  This dividing line right here we typically take as
[44:17.100 --> 44:24.300]  3,000 nanometers or three micrometers. The difference between shortwave and longwave.
[44:25.100 --> 44:31.500]  I've roughly drawn this to scale because it's the area under these curves that drives the
[44:32.220 --> 44:40.700]  energy. The area under this curve is roughly the same or maybe a little less than the area
[44:40.700 --> 44:44.540]  under this curve. Longwave transfer is a big deal.
[44:50.540 --> 44:58.700]  This is only thermal radiation. This is happening in a dark room. You would never get photosynthesis.
[44:58.700 --> 45:05.420]  It only warms up the leaf but it absolutely doesn't drive photosynthesis.
[45:07.660 --> 45:15.180]  While I'm on this, let's analyze shortwave radiation for a minute.
[45:17.180 --> 45:25.500]  If we take 400 and 700 nanometers right here, this is very close to the wavelengths that our
[45:25.500 --> 45:34.140]  human eyes can see. 400 is purple and 700 is deep red. It's like the burner on a stove. You can tell
[45:34.140 --> 45:38.860]  it's light but you wouldn't want to read a book by it. These are the wavelengths we can see.
[45:39.900 --> 45:52.380]  This area under here is about 42 percent of the total. Depends on sky conditions but as a rule
[45:52.380 --> 45:59.020]  of thumb about 42 percent drives photosynthesis. It's one of the reasons photosynthesis is so
[45:59.020 --> 46:06.060]  inefficient. All this thermal radiation from the sun out here that doesn't drive photosynthesis
[46:06.060 --> 46:14.140]  but it counts as heat and it warms the leaf up. This part here, this tiny part of course, is ultraviolet.
[46:15.100 --> 46:28.300]  This is about six percent of the total. Then I can show this part in red. This is infrared.
[46:29.020 --> 46:55.580]  This red marker is better. Infrared out here and generally this zone in here we call near infrared because it's close to the visible.
[46:56.540 --> 47:08.860]  That's all this part in here and it's 42. This is roughly half or like 52 percent of the total radiation.
[47:10.140 --> 47:21.420]  These are three key components of shortwave and all this analysis so far just lumped them all together for the three.
[47:22.380 --> 47:33.900]  Because the shape of this curve is important and out here is where we get dips, black line,
[47:35.180 --> 47:42.300]  showing absorption of water vapor and CO2. Big dips in this band.
[47:42.860 --> 47:50.540]  There's a big difference between the extraterrestrial curve and what we measure on the surface.
[47:50.540 --> 47:58.060]  Of course our instruments measure what's on the surface.
[47:59.100 --> 48:07.740]  Many people here might have seen this magnet.
[48:08.060 --> 48:17.500]  We made this magnet some years ago to help show the shape of this curve.
[48:18.220 --> 48:22.380]  Now with the wonders of this technology I can make this magnet big.
[48:25.420 --> 48:29.820]  Here's this curve at the surface of the earth and it's shown in two forms.
[48:29.900 --> 48:37.980]  The units over here are the energy flux joules per meter squared per second and now they're per nanometer.
[48:37.980 --> 48:43.580]  It's just each individual wavelength and that's the red line. Here's the UV.
[48:43.580 --> 48:50.300]  There's a big jump right here at 400. Here's the visible up to 700 which is photosynthetic photon flux.
[48:50.300 --> 48:56.060]  Which is what the plants can use separate instruments to measure this.
[48:56.940 --> 49:02.940]  The rest of it out here now you can start to see bigger energy bands. This only goes to a thousand.
[49:06.220 --> 49:12.460]  To complete the curve this should go to three thousand. This tapers off.
[49:12.460 --> 49:18.540]  There's less and less energy out here. You can see the tapering but this doesn't drop right there.
[49:18.540 --> 49:25.740]  It keeps tapering out. This is a useful magnet because it shows it both ways.
[49:26.620 --> 49:31.980]  We can calculate the photon flux from this and that's a different shape of a curve.
[49:33.340 --> 49:40.940]  The photon flux is what drives photosynthesis in between here and the energy flux is what drives transpiration.
[49:40.940 --> 49:47.180]  I see this on lots of people's fithing cabinets in their offices in different places.
[49:47.180 --> 49:53.900]  That was measured here in Logan at our elevation at noon, solar noon on the summer solstice.
[49:53.980 --> 49:58.140]  It's slightly different at different times of the year.
[49:58.140 --> 50:01.820]  It gives a reference on the brightest time of the year.
[50:08.860 --> 50:14.060]  While I'm on this we're not going to talk about photosynthesis per se in this class.
[50:15.580 --> 50:25.500]  Our instruments measure both of these and we go back and forth between energy and photons with
[50:26.060 --> 50:46.960]  Planck's equation. Energy is hc over the wavelength. Speed of light, Planck's constant, and the wavelength.
[50:47.840 --> 50:56.320]  The key part of this is energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength of light.
[50:56.400 --> 51:04.240]  I've got a handout with this worked out and I don't have it with me today so I'll come back to this.
[51:04.240 --> 51:11.520]  It helps us go back and forth between energy and photons calculating it in both units.
[51:11.520 --> 51:18.400]  It's helpful to show a worked out example of this and I'll show it next time.
[51:19.120 --> 51:27.440]  There's our solar curve with absorption bands for some of the factors in here.
[51:30.560 --> 51:38.000]  Now let's do long wave radiation. I've just got a few minutes left before the hour's up.
[51:39.360 --> 51:41.120]  Long wave is governed.
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.960]  I better leave that up here.
[51:55.960 --> 52:01.080]  One other key handout I made for us.
[52:04.040 --> 52:07.480]  Zoom out. Here it is.
[52:07.960 --> 52:19.480]  This is short wave and long wave radiation that I drew right here above the earth's atmosphere
[52:20.520 --> 52:29.400]  and at sea level. This is 1.5 air mass is the depth of air that the sunlight comes through.
[52:29.400 --> 52:35.000]  If the sun was perfectly overhead that would be one, but it's rarely is it perfectly overhead.
[52:35.080 --> 52:42.600]  It's at some angle. 1.5 is a typical amount of air for the sun to shine through.
[52:42.600 --> 52:50.680]  That's what 1.5 air mass is. If it's in the winter this can be really low angles. It can be three.
[52:50.680 --> 52:56.920]  It would be heavily filtered at really low angles. Here's these absorption bands and you can see how
[52:56.920 --> 53:02.040]  tiny the radiation gets out here. It's mostly absorbed above 2.5.
[53:04.040 --> 53:10.120]  This is long wave and there's lots of atmospheric absorption of long wave radiation.
[53:10.840 --> 53:16.760]  A perfect black body curve and then the absorption at different wavelengths here.
[53:17.080 --> 53:27.560]  We would like to know the amount of long wave radiation hitting things.
[53:28.600 --> 53:33.560]  We measure this with the black body pyranometer or some type of pyranometer.
[53:35.080 --> 53:41.080]  Long wave we can also measure with an instrument called a pergeometer,
[53:42.040 --> 53:52.040]  but we can also calculate it from surface temperature. To get that surface temperature measurement
[54:01.700 --> 54:13.880]  here we go. I love showing this picture of this guy. We go to Ludwig Boltzmann.
[54:14.760 --> 54:20.120]  This is from a book I have of the hundred most famous scientists in the world. I think Einstein
[54:20.120 --> 54:28.360]  was number one. Boltzmann made it to number 24 in this list. I've really enjoyed reading about
[54:28.360 --> 54:36.360]  some of these people because lots of them are really eccentric. Boltzmann was in and out of
[54:36.360 --> 54:44.440]  insane asylums his whole life. He made it to 62 years old and he only died in 1906.
[54:45.720 --> 54:56.600]  What a crazy guy. I'll show you Max Planck in this book who is up one of the top scientists.
[54:57.720 --> 55:03.480]  Max Planck had a perfectly ordered life. I could imagine him with the perfectly clean desk and
[55:03.480 --> 55:10.840]  nothing out of order. He was just the complete opposite of Boltzmann. Boltzmann gave us
[55:12.680 --> 55:26.750]  what's called the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
[55:27.710 --> 55:38.430]  This is a widely used very famous law for long wave radiation. In principle it says
[55:38.430 --> 55:49.310]  energy is proportional to temperature. If the surface gets hotter
[55:50.030 --> 55:56.590]  the energy is more. That's pretty simple. If we know the surface temperature, we know the energy,
[55:57.150 --> 56:03.630]  use this in reverse. We measure the energy coming off a surface and we say that's got to be
[56:03.630 --> 56:07.950]  the temperature of the surface. We use this both directions. Sometimes we measure energy,
[56:07.950 --> 56:12.910]  predict temperature. Sometimes we measure temperature, predict energy. It has nothing
[56:12.910 --> 56:18.830]  to do with air temperature. It's all about surface temperature. To make this
[56:19.230 --> 56:25.390]  better than this simple principle, we've got energy equals
[56:29.150 --> 56:37.470]  this sigma, Greek letter sigma, which is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. I've used this enough.
[56:37.470 --> 56:48.910]  I can remember this number. It's 5.67 times 10 to the minus eighth watts per meter squared
[56:50.270 --> 57:00.190]  per Kelvin. Here's the big significance of this. Wow, 10 to the minus eighth.
[57:00.510 --> 57:06.590]  Kelvin is a big number, but this is a really small exponent.
[57:06.590 --> 57:13.710]  Lots of these constants in our equations have some really tiny, some really big exponents.
[57:14.430 --> 57:20.110]  Here's the amazing thing about this. All kinds of our equations have squared, something squared,
[57:20.110 --> 57:27.150]  or the square root of something. This is the only equation I know that has temperature. This is by
[57:27.150 --> 57:36.030]  the way temperature in Kelvin. To make this units cancel, it's temperature to the fourth power.
[57:37.950 --> 57:44.510]  It's really a nonlinear relationship with temperature, but because it's Kelvin,
[57:45.710 --> 57:54.990]  we're going from room temperatures 300 Kelvin, so 300 times to the fourth power, to maybe 305 to
[57:54.990 --> 58:15.430]  the fourth power. This is the relationship. Is this available energy?
[58:17.750 --> 58:24.150]  Good question. We didn't get into how much of this is absorbed yet, which we need to.
[58:25.590 --> 58:33.430]  This is the total energy transmitted. Not all of this is absorbed, which is a key point.
[58:33.750 --> 58:35.430]  First we'll talk about what's coming off.
[58:39.030 --> 58:43.750]  I've got one handout and then I'm going to stop and we're going to pick this up next time.
[58:45.270 --> 58:55.990]  Here we go. Always good when I can find my handouts. There's enough exponents in this.
[58:56.310 --> 59:03.510]  Here's a worked out example. Stefan-Boltzmann law of equation right there.
[59:04.390 --> 59:11.910]  273.15 to Kelvin. We put this to make it easy to do in a surface temperature in Celsius,
[59:12.630 --> 59:18.150]  and then you put it in an Excel spreadsheet and you run it. Here's the emitted radiation
[59:18.710 --> 59:27.510]  coming off the surfaces from minus 40 to plus 80. A hot surface of a car might get the plus 80 or
[59:27.510 --> 59:34.550]  something really hot in the sun. Look at the numbers. Now this is just three columns. Radiation
[59:34.550 --> 59:48.870]  emitted 25 degrees C, 448. As a rule of thumb, this leaf is 25 C.
[59:49.750 --> 01:00:05.430]  448 watts per meter squared is being given off by long wave radiation.
[01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:18.470]  All of a sudden we had 600 watts of shortwave absorbed. Wow! 448 is given off by long wave.
[01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:23.910]  This leaf doesn't have to evaporate that much water because of long wave emission.
[01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:34.950]  Now here's the thing that we'll pick up next time. Long wave works both ways. The leaf is giving it
[01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:43.750]  off to the environment, but down here we have ground and let's say the ground is 25 C. Now we
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:56.070]  have to count plus 448 coming in. If the ground temperature and the leaf are the same, this net
[01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:04.870]  long wave radiation cancels out and it's a small number. That's the simple basics. Next time
[01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:16.390]  we'll talk about a little letter right here, E, which is emissivity. What does different surfaces
[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:24.070]  emit at different rates? It's sort of like albedo only this is emission not reflection. This is a
[01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:31.030]  really key component and we'll pick it up next time. Next time we should be able to wrap up
[01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:37.990]  all the components of long wave in this and so we have a total absorbed
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:44.550]  radiation and how to calculate it. Then we can move on to these next components.
[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:55.830]  You can see the two graphs down here. This is slightly nonlinear
[01:01:56.710 --> 01:02:06.550]  because it's T to the fourth and this is the slope of the line. If you can estimate it between two
[01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:15.590]  points. Any questions that I can answer about this? You did a good job stopping me and
[01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:23.030]  especially when I had one minus albedo. You got to always be vigilant for those things.
[01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:30.150]  We'll see you tomorrow.
