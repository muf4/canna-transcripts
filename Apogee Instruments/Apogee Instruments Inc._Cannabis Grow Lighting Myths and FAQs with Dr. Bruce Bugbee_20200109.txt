[00:00.510 --> 00:11.310]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments and also professor of crop physiology at Utah State University.
[00:11.310 --> 00:20.030]  In this video today, we're going to talk about the basics of lighting as it applies to cannabis.
[00:20.030 --> 00:23.510]  This is profoundly misunderstood.
[00:23.510 --> 00:32.230]  The database is filled with a lot of myths that we have studied over the past year.
[00:32.230 --> 00:35.110]  And so we're calling this Cannabis 101.
[00:35.110 --> 00:41.110]  This first part of the series is just focused on lighting, which is one of the key parameters.
[00:41.110 --> 00:50.110]  Apogee has spent decades refining instruments to quantify light, the types of light, the intensities of light.
[00:50.110 --> 01:00.510]  In my experience, those instruments are underutilized to help refine the cultivation of cannabis.
[01:00.510 --> 01:06.590]  And part of it is just because people don't know how to interpret the data and how to make the measurements.
[01:06.590 --> 01:13.590]  As a company, Apogee Instruments' motto is, we help people make measurements.
[01:13.590 --> 01:19.790]  And part of that is our ongoing education to help people interpret the data that they get,
[01:19.790 --> 01:22.390]  make sure the measurements are high quality.
[01:22.390 --> 01:27.310]  And that's what this video is about with a focus on cannabis.
[01:27.310 --> 01:34.910]  We're not focused on all the other crops like lettuce that's grown under electric lights, just cannabis.
[01:34.910 --> 01:47.790]  Utah State University is one of the few agricultural universities that now has a license to study hemp at the university.
[01:47.790 --> 01:53.070]  And when I say cannabis, I mean both hemp and marijuana.
[01:53.070 --> 02:00.430]  Our license isn't for marijuana, it's only for hemp, but the studies apply to both types of cannabis.
[02:00.430 --> 02:05.230]  So I'm going to talk about cannabis in this video.
[02:05.230 --> 02:15.710]  So it's pretty hard to under emphasize the importance of light when you're growing a crop.
[02:15.710 --> 02:24.430]  And this next slide, which I've used many times in many talks, really focuses on that.
[02:24.430 --> 02:27.390]  Here's the nine cardinal parameters.
[02:27.390 --> 02:33.710]  If you were to take a university class, you would be reviewing each of these parameters.
[02:33.710 --> 02:45.390]  Four of the parameters are in the foliar environment, temperature, humidity, air velocity or wind, and carbon dioxide.
[02:45.550 --> 02:47.390]  Four are in the root zone environment.
[02:47.390 --> 02:51.630]  We have temperature down there, amount of water, nutrients, and oxygen.
[02:51.630 --> 02:57.790]  We teach whole classes on each one of these parameters.
[02:57.790 --> 03:03.870]  And we may do a series on cannabis on each one of these parameters.
[03:03.870 --> 03:10.750]  But today we're going to focus on the one that is absolutely critical, and that's light.
[03:10.750 --> 03:12.350]  We put this right at the top.
[03:12.350 --> 03:13.870]  Let's see if this...
[03:15.630 --> 03:16.990]  See if we can get this back.
[03:20.030 --> 03:21.630]  Then let's go to pen tool.
[03:22.430 --> 03:22.930]  There.
[03:23.470 --> 03:24.430]  There we go.
[03:24.430 --> 03:29.230]  Light. And let's see if we can get that yellow to emphasize the light.
[03:29.950 --> 03:33.950]  Light is coming in from all directions on this plant.
[03:34.990 --> 03:42.030]  And it drives the optimum levels of everything else.
[03:42.670 --> 03:49.150]  If you turn the light up, you have to give the plants more water because it drives the flux of water through the plant.
[03:49.150 --> 03:56.110]  I'm here. I should have drawn this in yellow or in blue for water flux through the plants.
[03:56.670 --> 03:59.070]  You turn the light up, you need more nutrients.
[03:59.070 --> 04:01.150]  You need more oxygen in the root zone.
[04:01.150 --> 04:02.510]  It drives everything.
[04:03.550 --> 04:06.590]  So often we get questions from people saying,
[04:07.310 --> 04:09.310]  My light must be too high.
[04:09.710 --> 04:13.550]  My plants are turning yellow or purple or some color.
[04:14.270 --> 04:20.670]  What it really is, is an imbalance between the amount of light and the optimum levels of all these things.
[04:21.070 --> 04:22.110]  It's like a race car.
[04:23.150 --> 04:26.910]  Cannabis is a race car that can go incredibly fast.
[04:27.550 --> 04:33.710]  If everything is optimum, you can give cannabis exceptionally high levels of light.
[04:34.030 --> 04:37.870]  And I'm going to go into how we measure that and quantify it.
[04:37.870 --> 04:42.270]  If all of these other parameters are also optimum.
[04:42.270 --> 04:46.830]  If you give it more light and you don't have the right nutrient balance or the right water,
[04:46.830 --> 04:52.430]  or you don't have elevated CO2, you're going to have problems with the plant.
[04:52.430 --> 04:55.150]  But it's not fundamentally caused by the light.
[04:55.150 --> 04:58.350]  It's caused by inadequate levels of the other parameters.
[04:58.350 --> 04:59.310]  It'd be like a race car.
[04:59.310 --> 05:00.910]  I'm saying you got a giant engine.
[05:01.470 --> 05:03.870]  You're out at the Utah, Bonneville, Salt Flats.
[05:03.870 --> 05:08.910]  You're going 700 miles an hour and the tires blow on the car.
[05:08.910 --> 05:10.430]  And you say, Ah, dang it.
[05:10.430 --> 05:11.710]  The engine was too big.
[05:11.710 --> 05:13.310]  No, the engine wasn't too big.
[05:13.310 --> 05:16.270]  You didn't have the right tires for that big of an engine.
[05:16.270 --> 05:21.790]  That's the analogy of how important it is to get the lighting right.
[05:21.790 --> 05:28.350]  So let's start with how we even measure light.
[05:29.390 --> 05:33.550]  So many people say, How much light do I need?
[05:33.550 --> 05:40.430]  And they'll say, Oh, keep your plants about 30 centimeters, about a foot away from the lights.
[05:41.470 --> 05:46.430]  Let me show you how bad that is as a measurement of light.
[05:47.070 --> 05:52.270]  And in order to do this, we have set up here in the Apogee studios,
[05:53.390 --> 05:55.710]  two lights of different wattages.
[05:55.710 --> 05:59.950]  And I'm going to do a demonstration now to show you how important that is.
[06:00.670 --> 06:08.190]  So I got to step over here and plug the light in, wheel this in.
[06:12.470 --> 06:15.430]  Now, here's two lights.
[06:15.430 --> 06:17.110]  Let's get them right in the screen.
[06:18.630 --> 06:20.790]  Two different wattages of lights.
[06:20.790 --> 06:22.070]  They're both LEDs.
[06:22.070 --> 06:23.430]  I could turn them toward the screen.
[06:23.430 --> 06:25.030]  It'd be incredibly bright.
[06:25.030 --> 06:27.750]  Now, we've set this up so we can measure.
[06:29.830 --> 06:37.990]  If I can do this right there, we can measure the intensity of the light from these.
[06:37.990 --> 06:39.190]  Here's the number right here.
[06:39.190 --> 06:41.510]  We'll get into what this means in just a second.
[06:42.230 --> 06:46.310]  But it's 27 micromoles of photons right now.
[06:46.310 --> 06:48.230]  That's the light from the studio.
[06:48.230 --> 06:51.670]  If I put this over here, seven.
[06:51.670 --> 06:55.110]  Now, seven is plenty of light for humans to work in.
[06:55.110 --> 06:57.910]  A well-lit office has seven micromoles.
[06:58.710 --> 07:02.150]  That is way too low to grow cannabis.
[07:02.150 --> 07:03.670]  You can tell these are a little brighter.
[07:03.670 --> 07:06.150]  What if we said it's seven here?
[07:06.870 --> 07:08.630]  How bright is it over here?
[07:08.630 --> 07:12.470]  Oh, it might be 50 over here.
[07:12.470 --> 07:13.750]  Let's take a look.
[07:13.750 --> 07:15.350]  We're going to go under this light.
[07:16.790 --> 07:18.150]  Now, let's see if we can do this.
[07:18.150 --> 07:19.430]  Can you see the screen?
[07:19.430 --> 07:20.230]  I think you can.
[07:20.790 --> 07:24.470]  I'm going to hold this right here about a foot away.
[07:25.430 --> 07:27.190]  You see the number we're getting?
[07:27.190 --> 07:29.030]  300 micromoles.
[07:29.910 --> 07:35.030]  A well-lit office is seven to ten, and this is 300.
[07:36.150 --> 07:40.550]  And it looks a little brighter, but it doesn't look 20 or 30 times as bright.
[07:40.550 --> 07:41.990]  It's much, much brighter.
[07:42.790 --> 07:43.830]  That's a foot away.
[07:44.790 --> 07:47.110]  What if that was our measure for cannabis?
[07:47.110 --> 07:48.550]  And we say, here's another light.
[07:49.110 --> 07:50.710]  Let's go a foot away.
[07:50.710 --> 07:52.150]  Now we put it under this light.
[07:53.590 --> 07:54.150]  Look at this.
[07:55.190 --> 07:56.630]  I got to get it centered.
[07:59.350 --> 08:00.870]  3,000.
[08:02.230 --> 08:04.470]  Depends on exactly how far away.
[08:05.430 --> 08:08.390]  But we're approaching 3,000 micromoles.
[08:08.390 --> 08:10.230]  If I go a hair closer, there it is.
[08:10.230 --> 08:13.430]  3,000 micromoles under this light.
[08:14.150 --> 08:15.670]  And we go under this light.
[08:16.470 --> 08:17.350]  Same distance.
[08:18.790 --> 08:20.390]  We're down around 300.
[08:20.390 --> 08:28.310]  That is almost an order of magnitude more photons under one light than the other.
[08:28.310 --> 08:31.750]  And the only difference is the input wattage.
[08:32.310 --> 08:33.990]  This is a low input wattage.
[08:33.990 --> 08:35.510]  This is a high input wattage.
[08:35.510 --> 08:36.550]  It's not color of light.
[08:36.550 --> 08:37.590]  It's input wattage.
[08:37.590 --> 08:44.870]  So I hope you can see that just saying, put your plant some distance away from the lights,
[08:44.870 --> 08:50.390]  is a very inadequate way to precisely grow cannabis.
[08:50.390 --> 08:51.830]  You've got to have a meter.
[08:52.710 --> 08:57.110]  Our eyes are one of the worst meters for plants.
[08:58.310 --> 09:07.590]  Our pupils contract to reduce the amount of light getting to our retina in bright light.
[09:07.590 --> 09:14.230]  So we're a terrible light meter in terms of intuitive estimating of light.
[09:14.230 --> 09:17.030]  We really need an instrument to measure it.
[09:17.750 --> 09:21.910]  So this is a demo of the fact that you can't do that.
[09:21.910 --> 09:24.790]  Now, remember that number.
[09:25.590 --> 09:31.590]  Let's take 300 micromoles and how much cannabis could we grow with that?
[09:31.590 --> 09:35.830]  Now I'm going to stop here and take these out of the way and so we can interpret the data.
[09:37.350 --> 09:43.510]  Now we're back with a white screen that we can take a look at what we just measured.
[09:45.110 --> 09:54.230]  So first of all, let's draw what we call a light response curve for plants in general.
[09:54.870 --> 09:58.790]  And then we'll draw a light response curve for cannabis.
[09:59.990 --> 10:07.350]  So as students in my classes know, over the years I draw a lot of xy plots
[10:07.910 --> 10:11.430]  to take an input variable here and look at response.
[10:11.430 --> 10:15.750]  So what we're going to put over here is Pn.
[10:16.550 --> 10:19.750]  This stands for net photosynthesis.
[10:20.630 --> 10:30.070]  And over here we're going to put PPFD, photosynthetic photon flux density.
[10:30.070 --> 10:33.430]  That's what we just measured with that apogee meter.
[10:33.430 --> 10:36.950]  This graph starts at zero here and zero here.
[10:37.350 --> 10:43.430]  If this was introduction to plant science and we asked this question,
[10:44.150 --> 10:50.790]  everyone would say, well, of course, light or photon flux drives photosynthesis.
[10:50.790 --> 10:54.950]  So that curve is going to look like that.
[10:55.990 --> 11:00.950]  And if this was plant science 101, we would count that as a correct answer.
[11:01.110 --> 11:11.030]  But if it's a more advanced class, we know that the higher the light,
[11:11.030 --> 11:13.510]  this doesn't keep going up forever.
[11:13.510 --> 11:20.150]  Plants can't keep using all those photons, so a more correct answer looks like this.
[11:21.510 --> 11:28.150]  And we can even erase this top incorrect answer and go back to this.
[11:28.470 --> 11:32.550]  There's a more correct answer because it levels off at high light.
[11:32.550 --> 11:35.910]  Now notice I didn't put any tick marks on here yet,
[11:36.630 --> 11:43.270]  because we just measured 300 micromoles and even almost 3000 out of that other light.
[11:43.670 --> 11:49.510]  But there's one more thing that makes this curve even more accurate,
[11:49.510 --> 11:51.830]  and I'll put that in blue.
[11:52.070 --> 12:01.110]  If you take a plant and put it in the dark, it gradually respires and dies.
[12:01.110 --> 12:03.990]  You can't keep it in the dark for weeks or months.
[12:04.790 --> 12:09.350]  So this line doesn't go through zero right there.
[12:09.350 --> 12:13.590]  In the dark, we get a negative number.
[12:13.590 --> 12:16.470]  The plant is shrinking, it's dying.
[12:16.470 --> 12:21.030]  And we turn on the lights and it goes like this.
[12:22.790 --> 12:28.230]  So there's some point right here where there's just enough light to keep the plant alive.
[12:28.230 --> 12:33.590]  This, by the way, is called the light compensation point when there's enough light to get it to zero.
[12:35.590 --> 12:39.110]  Now let's put some tick marks on this axis.
[12:39.110 --> 12:40.550]  Photosynthesis...
[12:41.270 --> 12:50.390]  Let's make this go to 60 up here.
[12:50.390 --> 12:58.870]  By the way, the units for this are micromoles per meter squared of leaf per second of time.
[12:59.590 --> 13:02.710]  This is how fast it's fixing carbon and dry weight.
[13:03.590 --> 13:05.430]  Now let's put some tick marks on this.
[13:06.070 --> 13:09.990]  If we go up to here, what's full sunlight?
[13:09.990 --> 13:15.830]  If we went outside in the summer at noon, what would we get for high light?
[13:16.390 --> 13:19.270]  We would get 2000.
[13:20.550 --> 13:23.430]  That's an important reference point.
[13:23.430 --> 13:24.230]  2000.
[13:24.950 --> 13:34.310]  These units are micromoles of photons per meter squared per second.
[13:35.270 --> 13:40.070]  And this could be over here, could be just yield of the plants.
[13:40.870 --> 13:44.230]  But these are the units that we're measuring to get the light.
[13:44.230 --> 13:53.110]  Now if that's 2000, 1000 is right here and 500 is right here.
[13:55.110 --> 14:02.550]  On the way I drew this graph, wow, we have to have 400 micromoles just to get above zero.
[14:03.350 --> 14:07.590]  Now this only happens in a dense crop.
[14:09.190 --> 14:12.310]  But let me see if I can erase this.
[14:13.430 --> 14:14.950]  Erase these lines.
[14:17.110 --> 14:19.270]  And I'm going to draw two lines on here.
[14:23.430 --> 14:25.110]  Let's go back to green.
[14:25.110 --> 14:26.470]  We're going to fill this back in.
[14:27.430 --> 14:28.390]  Here's our green.
[14:28.390 --> 14:29.830]  There's 500.
[14:29.830 --> 14:30.870]  Now let's go to blue.
[14:31.830 --> 14:38.870]  If we did these measurements for lettuce, lettuce is a widely grown crop, very widely studied.
[14:39.590 --> 14:43.270]  It is also a low light plant.
[14:43.270 --> 14:47.990]  Lettuce grows fine in much lower light than cannabis.
[14:47.990 --> 14:51.670]  So if we draw a curve for lettuce, first of all it starts here.
[14:52.790 --> 14:58.710]  It goes up and at about 500, lettuce is done.
[14:59.670 --> 15:03.590]  And it might even go down out here of really high light.
[15:03.590 --> 15:04.470]  This is lettuce.
[15:10.560 --> 15:11.360]  There.
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.320]  Now what if we put cannabis on here?
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.120]  Cannabis is life in the fast lane.
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.800]  It takes a lot of light.
[15:20.800 --> 15:23.840]  You can grow cannabis much faster.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.080]  We're going to put cannabis in red.
[15:26.640 --> 15:30.320]  First of all, it doesn't really have a low gear.
[15:30.720 --> 15:32.880]  It has a high respiration rate.
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.440]  Cannabis looks something like this.
[15:36.000 --> 15:36.880]  Look at this curve.
[15:36.880 --> 15:37.680]  Look at that curve.
[15:38.480 --> 15:38.980]  Wow.
[15:39.760 --> 15:40.800]  This is cannabis.
[15:47.060 --> 15:50.580]  It keeps going up until 2000.
[15:51.620 --> 15:54.820]  So cannabis is a very high light crop.
[15:54.820 --> 16:00.820]  You can give it a lot of light, but you've got to have all the other inputs optimized.
[16:01.780 --> 16:05.540]  For sure, you need elevated CO2 for cannabis.
[16:06.900 --> 16:08.580]  And ample water.
[16:08.580 --> 16:10.420]  It's usually automated watering.
[16:12.100 --> 16:15.460]  It's a balanced nutrient solution.
[16:15.460 --> 16:18.100]  That's a topic of a whole other talk.
[16:18.100 --> 16:22.980]  But our data don't indicate cannabis needs unusual nutrients,
[16:22.980 --> 16:25.860]  but it needs a balanced nutrients and not too much.
[16:25.860 --> 16:29.220]  Usually there's toxicities from too much nutrients.
[16:29.780 --> 16:33.620]  And if you have this high light and the water is going through the plant that fast,
[16:33.620 --> 16:36.820]  you have to be careful not to have too much nutrients.
[16:36.820 --> 16:39.460]  But the point is, look at cannabis.
[16:40.500 --> 16:42.340]  Corn is like this too.
[16:42.900 --> 16:45.060]  Corn is a very high light field crop.
[16:45.860 --> 16:49.540]  So now we get a meter to measure this.
[16:49.540 --> 16:54.980]  And if the leaves are green, we're using the photons efficiently
[16:54.980 --> 16:56.980]  and we have high photosynthetic rates.
[16:57.060 --> 16:59.700]  Let's take a look on this.
[16:59.700 --> 17:04.340]  Now a closer look at this unit down here.
[17:04.340 --> 17:10.340]  This is generally a widely used unit, but it's not universal.
[17:10.340 --> 17:12.420]  And let's take a look at this.
[17:12.420 --> 17:15.780]  And I can do that on the next screen.
[17:16.660 --> 17:18.740]  Now let's go back to green.
[17:20.340 --> 17:25.300]  Multiple acronyms are used to measure light.
[17:25.380 --> 17:30.580]  And the most common one is PAR.
[17:31.620 --> 17:32.740]  That stands for...
[17:32.740 --> 17:38.100]  The P always stands for photosynthetically active radiation.
[17:38.100 --> 17:46.490]  Let's go to a slightly smaller line size.
[17:46.490 --> 17:48.010]  That's a pretty fat line.
[17:48.010 --> 17:48.510]  All right.
[17:49.130 --> 17:50.330]  Now we've got a PAR.
[17:51.370 --> 17:56.010]  This is a generic term for all photosynthetically active radiation.
[17:56.010 --> 17:59.770]  But it could mean watts per meter squared and that's confusing.
[17:59.770 --> 18:04.970]  So a more rigorous term is PPFD.
[18:06.090 --> 18:12.090]  That stands for photosynthetic photon flux density.
[18:13.210 --> 18:20.170]  And this always means that number from the previous one, moles of photons.
[18:21.050 --> 18:24.810]  And you think of photons as like tiny little marbles falling out of the sky.
[18:24.970 --> 18:26.970]  Marbles falling out of the sky to fill a box.
[18:26.970 --> 18:29.930]  They can be colored marbles, but they're all marbles.
[18:29.930 --> 18:33.770]  We're measuring this flux of photons coming into the plant.
[18:35.130 --> 18:41.130]  Per meter squared per unit area of surface area per unit time.
[18:41.130 --> 18:42.730]  And we always use per second.
[18:43.850 --> 18:45.690]  That's the unit for PPFD.
[18:45.690 --> 18:49.210]  Now this is a big number, a mole.
[18:49.850 --> 18:52.650]  And so it's really a micromole.
[18:52.650 --> 18:55.930]  10 to the minus 6 moles per second.
[18:55.930 --> 19:02.890]  And this number ranges, and we just showed that in the other slide, zero up to 2,000.
[19:03.850 --> 19:05.210]  It's a huge range.
[19:05.210 --> 19:06.650]  Remember those lights we measured?
[19:06.650 --> 19:07.770]  One was 300.
[19:09.290 --> 19:13.530]  One was over 3,000 because it was a high wattage light and we're real close to it.
[19:15.770 --> 19:16.650]  These are the keys.
[19:17.210 --> 19:24.330]  Now we'll come back to this later, but PPFD is the number that we're after here for light.
[19:25.610 --> 19:29.130]  Now let's go to another screen.
[19:30.970 --> 19:34.010]  We're going to take our same screen here.
[19:36.570 --> 19:41.530]  And we had PPFD zero.
[19:42.650 --> 19:45.130]  Let's go all the way to 2,000.
[19:45.130 --> 19:46.490]  This is very bright light.
[19:46.490 --> 19:51.370]  We rarely get this high of light under electric lights, but we could.
[19:51.370 --> 19:53.770]  And over here we're just going to put yield.
[19:57.050 --> 20:01.450]  Not photosynthesis anymore because photosynthesis leads to yield.
[20:03.050 --> 20:04.810]  How much light is necessary?
[20:05.610 --> 20:11.050]  What's really key about this is not the instantaneous light.
[20:11.050 --> 20:13.770]  We're going to put our graph on here again.
[20:14.410 --> 20:16.090]  Something like this.
[20:16.330 --> 20:22.410]  The exact shape varies with different cultivars, but it doesn't vary very much.
[20:23.930 --> 20:27.530]  It turns out it's not exactly the PPFD.
[20:28.090 --> 20:35.450]  It is the DLI, daily light integral.
[20:36.890 --> 20:42.650]  So as this implies, an integral means we add up all of the photons.
[20:43.610 --> 20:47.450]  This is per second, and every second we accumulate them.
[20:48.010 --> 20:49.290]  What if this was rainfall?
[20:49.850 --> 20:51.930]  PPFD would tell us the rate.
[20:51.930 --> 20:54.410]  How fast is it raining per second?
[20:54.410 --> 20:59.850]  But usually what we want to know is how much did it rain yesterday, the total amount of rain.
[21:00.570 --> 21:04.570]  And that's the daily light integral called DLI.
[21:05.850 --> 21:07.770]  Let me show you how to convert.
[21:07.770 --> 21:10.010]  Once you see this, you'll know it forever.
[21:10.810 --> 21:14.650]  Let's put 1,000 in here.
[21:16.250 --> 21:19.450]  We're going to convert from PPFD to DLI.
[21:20.330 --> 21:30.730]  1,000 micromoles per meter squared per second.
[21:31.770 --> 21:33.370]  Now we want to know per day.
[21:33.370 --> 21:39.930]  Per day, well, there's 3,600 seconds per hour.
[21:41.930 --> 21:44.730]  So this is 3.6.
[21:44.730 --> 21:49.690]  Now notice this is 1,000 and that's 3,000.
[21:49.690 --> 21:58.090]  And when you multiply these together, the thousands cancel, and this is 3.6 moles.
[21:58.330 --> 22:03.050]  Now no micro anymore because we just multiplied two big numbers together.
[22:03.930 --> 22:08.250]  3.6 moles per meter squared.
[22:08.250 --> 22:10.250]  Now this is per hour.
[22:11.210 --> 22:12.170]  We're still not there.
[22:12.170 --> 22:13.210]  That's per hour.
[22:14.170 --> 22:26.010]  For cannabis, when it's in the flowering stage, we would give it, typically give it 12 hours per day.
[22:26.490 --> 22:35.120]  And we multiply these two together, 3.6 and 12.
[22:35.120 --> 22:38.480]  I know this because I've done it so many times.
[22:39.200 --> 22:49.520]  That comes out to be 43.2 moles per meter squared per day.
[22:50.640 --> 22:57.120]  And that number right there, this is so important, we'll put it in red, is the DLI.
[22:58.560 --> 23:08.160]  If you had 1,000 micromoles per second continuously for 12 hours, you get 43 a day.
[23:09.440 --> 23:13.440]  This is high light, but cannabis responds to this.
[23:13.440 --> 23:17.200]  In our studies, we can push them even higher than this.
[23:17.200 --> 23:21.440]  We've never gone to 2,000, but we've gone close to it.
[23:21.440 --> 23:27.040]  We've gone, oh, to 1,800, up to where we've gotten this number close to 60.
[23:28.320 --> 23:40.320]  Outside in the summer, under full sunlight, on sunny days, DLI can get to 60 moles per meter squared per day.
[23:40.320 --> 23:42.320]  That's an incredible DLI.
[23:42.320 --> 23:45.280]  Cannabis grows outside in full sunlight, and it loves it.
[23:45.280 --> 23:46.480]  It responds to it.
[23:47.120 --> 23:50.400]  So you can run the DLI up extremely high.
[23:50.400 --> 23:52.320]  Now, how low can you go?
[23:52.320 --> 23:53.760]  Well, here'd be 500.
[23:53.920 --> 23:55.920]  And you see the point here.
[23:56.640 --> 23:58.880]  There's some diminishing returns.
[23:58.880 --> 24:03.200]  It's still, the line still goes up, but it's curving over.
[24:03.840 --> 24:10.880]  So 2,000 doesn't give us twice the yield of 1,000, but it's still higher.
[24:10.880 --> 24:12.320]  So we keep raising this.
[24:12.320 --> 24:13.920]  There'd be 500 right here.
[24:15.520 --> 24:21.600]  But the point is, you've got to get this, you've got to know this input to have reproducible studies
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.760]  and to get it, you need to measure it.
[24:26.720 --> 24:33.120]  Let's take a second to look at, review some of the instruments that Apogee uses.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.760]  All of them are a little sensor here.
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.840]  The quantum sensor is blue.
[24:37.840 --> 24:40.320]  That's the one we used a minute ago to measure these.
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.320]  This one plugs right in to a laptop.
[24:46.320 --> 24:49.920]  Here's a USB cable, and we can plug right in.
[24:49.920 --> 24:52.640]  You got to remember to take the cap off of these.
[24:52.640 --> 24:57.920]  The optics here are really rugged, but we still ship them with the cap to keep them perfect.
[24:57.920 --> 25:01.840]  Plug this right into a laptop, just like I did, and you'll see the numbers on the screen.
[25:02.640 --> 25:10.400]  If you don't, if you want something more portable, here is a handheld meter with a separate sensor.
[25:10.400 --> 25:12.720]  These also come with the sensor right in it.
[25:13.600 --> 25:14.720]  That's another option.
[25:15.680 --> 25:22.000]  One of the options that's big and catching on fast is Bluetooth.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.200]  This is a Bluetooth module, it's like a data logger.
[25:25.920 --> 25:33.040]  It measures and stores the data, and then you just transmit this data right to your cell phone.
[25:33.040 --> 25:34.800]  So this is a powerful option.
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.480]  There's plenty of graphics associated with this for measuring the light.
[25:40.480 --> 25:42.640]  All of them go to this sensor.
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.920]  If you jump up another level, this gold cube is a spectral radiometer,
[25:49.920 --> 25:52.400]  which gives you all the ratios of colors.
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.680]  But these other instruments are down in the a few hundred dollars.
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.640]  This instrument is over two thousand dollars.
[26:00.640 --> 26:02.880]  This is much more sophisticated,
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.840]  but this is what researchers use to get everything exactly right in all of these.
[26:08.480 --> 26:16.240]  So we get questions all the time on issues relating to light.
[26:17.440 --> 26:22.720]  And I just addressed one of them, daily light integral.
[26:23.440 --> 26:29.440]  We can push daily light integral easily to 30, to 40, to 50,
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.440]  and the yield keeps going up if everything's optimal.
[26:34.400 --> 26:34.900]  Let's...
[26:36.080 --> 26:43.360]  And in terms of how much light it tolerates, this is true even for young seedlings.
[26:43.360 --> 26:44.480]  We once took...
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.000]  One of our research projects right now is to push the rooting of cuttings of cannabis
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.240]  with very high light.
[26:54.240 --> 26:56.000]  This just sounds amazing.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.240]  But for years and years, we'd keep plants in really low light with cuttings
[27:00.240 --> 27:01.600]  because they didn't have any roots.
[27:01.680 --> 27:03.680]  We're finding if we can keep them watered,
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.280]  we can even push a cutting with very high light levels.
[27:07.280 --> 27:10.880]  And certainly a young plant, you can push them hard with high light.
[27:10.880 --> 27:14.800]  Again, as long as the other inputs are not limiting growth.
[27:17.040 --> 27:20.560]  What about darkness?
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.280]  Let's go to another screen.
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.280]  Another topic.
[27:27.280 --> 27:28.800]  We'll put this one in blue.
[27:29.120 --> 27:35.610]  Now we're going to do hours per day.
[27:36.650 --> 27:37.850]  It's a different graph.
[27:38.410 --> 27:38.970]  Hours.
[27:40.090 --> 27:40.890]  Here's noon.
[27:43.610 --> 27:44.570]  Here's midnight.
[27:46.890 --> 27:49.380]  And here's midnight.
[27:51.860 --> 27:54.260]  And of course, here's PPFD.
[27:54.580 --> 27:55.700]  PPFD.
[27:58.260 --> 28:03.300]  We have no evidence that suddenly turning on the light shocks the plants.
[28:03.300 --> 28:05.460]  They can get out of bed and go right to work.
[28:05.460 --> 28:07.700]  They don't need to ramp up slowly.
[28:07.700 --> 28:12.020]  But let's say we turn on the lights at 6 a.m.
[28:12.660 --> 28:16.100]  We run them high until 10 p.m.
[28:17.780 --> 28:18.500]  If we ran them...
[28:19.620 --> 28:22.900]  This would be 16 hours of light.
[28:22.900 --> 28:25.060]  Now if we're in flowering phase...
[28:25.700 --> 28:27.380]  Let's go back to red.
[28:27.380 --> 28:35.460]  If we're in flowering phase, we might run them from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
[28:37.220 --> 28:37.860]  Like this.
[28:40.740 --> 28:42.900]  And this is a 12-hour photo period.
[28:43.860 --> 28:46.500]  So there's really just two photo periods for cannabis.
[28:47.060 --> 28:51.220]  A 16 and even an 18-hour photo period for veg.
[28:51.220 --> 28:56.020]  And in fact, some of our data indicates this could even be 24 hours for veg.
[28:56.580 --> 29:00.020]  Just get the plants growing with a high DLI.
[29:00.020 --> 29:03.220]  And then when we want them to flower, we switch to 12.
[29:03.860 --> 29:05.300]  Now here's the question.
[29:05.860 --> 29:07.060]  So this is all fine.
[29:07.700 --> 29:08.740]  What about right here?
[29:10.100 --> 29:12.740]  This number right here is darkness.
[29:14.340 --> 29:18.740]  How dark does it have to be for cannabis at night?
[29:19.700 --> 29:25.300]  This is something we're actively studying right now in my laboratory at the university.
[29:26.340 --> 29:33.060]  There are some literature reports that indicate that cannabis is exquisitely sensitive to trace
[29:33.060 --> 29:35.060]  amounts of light pollution.
[29:35.060 --> 29:39.220]  Just a little bit of light will cause problems with cannabis.
[29:39.940 --> 29:43.780]  We have a wealth of literature on Poinsettias.
[29:43.780 --> 29:46.900]  They're one of our most sensitive crops to light pollution.
[29:47.700 --> 29:54.100]  Without excellent darkness, those top leaves of cannabis don't turn red.
[29:54.100 --> 29:55.380]  They're called bracts.
[29:55.380 --> 29:56.340]  They don't turn red.
[29:56.900 --> 30:00.260]  Is cannabis more sensitive than Poinsettias?
[30:00.980 --> 30:06.100]  We don't know yet, but we know it needs to be very dark.
[30:06.900 --> 30:10.260]  We call this reagent-grade darkness.
[30:10.260 --> 30:12.020]  And it's like somebody sleeping.
[30:12.020 --> 30:16.420]  Some people are bothered by a tiny light sleep and other people doesn't matter.
[30:16.500 --> 30:19.300]  But we think cannabis is quite sensitive to this.
[30:20.260 --> 30:29.220]  For this reason, Apogee has made an extended-range quantum sensor that's calibrated
[30:29.780 --> 30:33.940]  to rigorously measure light pollution.
[30:33.940 --> 30:37.700]  Now remember, we were doing micromoles per meter squared per second,
[30:37.700 --> 30:40.100]  and we were getting numbers in the hundreds.
[30:40.820 --> 30:50.580]  This particular sensor can measure 0.01 micromoles per meter squared per second.
[30:51.860 --> 30:56.580]  It's a unique meter that can detect trace amounts of light,
[30:56.580 --> 31:00.020]  and it helps you determine whether it's absolutely dark.
[31:00.020 --> 31:02.660]  It's an extended-range sensor.
[31:02.660 --> 31:06.660]  Even picks up the photons from security cameras,
[31:06.660 --> 31:10.420]  which there's possibilities for those to affect cannabis.
[31:10.420 --> 31:13.140]  That's a topic for another video.
[31:13.140 --> 31:18.580]  So extended-range quantum sensor for light pollution studies.
[31:18.580 --> 31:21.060]  This is getting down around full moonlight,
[31:21.060 --> 31:26.580]  and we know that full moonlight doesn't affect cannabis or any other plants,
[31:26.580 --> 31:29.620]  but it might not take much more of that to be a big deal.
[31:31.060 --> 31:36.500]  Let's talk about cultivars, differences.
[31:36.500 --> 31:42.020]  Many people say, gee, this happened in one, and this is something else happened in another.
[31:42.020 --> 31:45.460]  We have an emerging number of different cultivars for cannabis.
[31:46.020 --> 31:50.980]  As you probably know if you're watching this video, I won't write them up here.
[31:50.980 --> 31:58.820]  They're all cannabis sativa, and underneath that we have indica and sativa.
[31:58.820 --> 32:00.980]  So it's cannabis, sativa, sativa.
[32:01.940 --> 32:07.540]  Our studies at the university indicate there's definitely differences in those,
[32:07.540 --> 32:13.700]  leaf width, leaf size, but in terms of response to all these parameters I'm talking about,
[32:14.420 --> 32:18.740]  there's not a significant difference between the types.
[32:18.740 --> 32:22.820]  You can push both types of cannabis with high light.
[32:23.540 --> 32:25.220]  They both love high light.
[32:25.220 --> 32:26.980]  They both evolved out in the field.
[32:28.180 --> 32:30.340]  The differences can be in yield.
[32:30.340 --> 32:32.980]  They can be in photo period sensitivity.
[32:32.980 --> 32:38.340]  Some cultivars of cannabis we think can take 13 hours of light over here.
[32:38.340 --> 32:44.260]  Some might be able to take 14, but in terms of pushing them with high light, they're all similar.
[32:45.940 --> 32:48.740]  Let's think about some of the other cultivars.
[32:50.020 --> 32:54.740]  One of them, and some of the other questions we get, one of them is,
[32:55.700 --> 33:03.860]  what about light quality and the synthesis of what we call cannabinoid compounds?
[33:03.860 --> 33:10.500]  That's THC, CBD, CBN, CBG, all the different cannabinoid compounds.
[33:10.500 --> 33:13.540]  Then in another class of compounds, there's terpenes.
[33:14.260 --> 33:15.780]  What about light quality?
[33:16.500 --> 33:21.780]  And it could be a whole other talk, and I have given other talks on this.
[33:21.780 --> 33:26.340]  They're in other videos on the Apogee website.
[33:26.340 --> 33:29.540]  So if you're interested in this, look for other videos on this.
[33:30.340 --> 33:32.100]  Here's the take-home message.
[33:32.100 --> 33:38.420]  We don't have evidence that changing the colors of light
[33:39.060 --> 33:43.620]  makes a significant difference on cannabinoid synthesis.
[33:44.740 --> 33:45.780]  Let me say that again.
[33:45.780 --> 33:47.380]  This is an amazing statement.
[33:48.180 --> 33:54.260]  Light quality does not have a huge effect on the ratios of cannabinoids.
[33:54.820 --> 33:58.340]  This is in spite of many people claiming it does.
[34:00.020 --> 34:05.060]  Our data in general don't support that there's big effects.
[34:05.060 --> 34:06.820]  I didn't say there was none.
[34:06.820 --> 34:09.300]  We just don't see big effects.
[34:09.300 --> 34:12.980]  We're still actively studying that, and stay tuned,
[34:12.980 --> 34:16.260]  because we're looking at all kinds of different ratios.
[34:17.220 --> 34:26.660]  Now, let me conclude on one part of light that is enormously important.
[34:27.460 --> 34:29.140]  And we're going to go to a new screen.
[34:30.020 --> 34:30.820]  Last slide.
[34:33.060 --> 34:34.260]  I don't like to draw those.
[34:34.260 --> 34:37.780]  I'm going to draw the axes in blue.
[34:37.940 --> 34:43.540]  This is 400 to 700.
[34:44.980 --> 34:46.980]  And this is the wavelength of light.
[34:47.540 --> 34:51.140]  If you're going to get a degree, an honorary degree in cannabis science,
[34:51.140 --> 34:53.700]  you've got to memorize these two numbers.
[34:54.260 --> 34:57.620]  These are... this is... we use lambda to express this.
[34:58.340 --> 35:00.420]  And the unit here is nanometers.
[35:00.980 --> 35:03.220]  So this is colors of light.
[35:03.620 --> 35:09.220]  This is what you would use this spectroradiometer to measure.
[35:10.420 --> 35:12.900]  So I think most people know, but let's review this.
[35:13.460 --> 35:21.460]  Right here, if we do 500 and 600, this area right here,
[35:22.900 --> 35:24.340]  400 to 500 is blue.
[35:25.540 --> 35:29.300]  It looks blue to the human eye, and we call that range blue.
[35:29.300 --> 35:34.980]  Now we go to 500 to 600, and that range is green.
[35:37.220 --> 35:42.260]  And now we go to 600 to 700, and that range is red.
[35:43.460 --> 35:47.220]  For many of you, this is review, but it's important to have the basics.
[35:47.220 --> 35:47.620]  All right.
[35:48.820 --> 35:54.260]  Photosynthetic radiation stops right here.
[35:54.500 --> 36:02.580]  Our historic and classic definition of this is 400 to 700, period.
[36:03.140 --> 36:07.220]  If there's a photon at 701, we don't count it.
[36:07.220 --> 36:10.340]  If it's at 399, we don't count it.
[36:11.060 --> 36:11.700]  Is that right?
[36:12.260 --> 36:12.820]  Really?
[36:12.820 --> 36:13.620]  They chop?
[36:13.620 --> 36:15.620]  No, they don't chop off like that.
[36:15.620 --> 36:16.980]  We've known that for years.
[36:17.700 --> 36:23.540]  This is just a useful approximation of photosynthetic radiation.
[36:24.020 --> 36:30.500]  But now that we have LEDs, that we can fine-tune all these wavelengths,
[36:30.500 --> 36:35.860]  we are re-examining what we have used for half a century.
[36:36.500 --> 36:39.460]  And there's two specific wavelengths that are huge.
[36:39.460 --> 36:41.060]  I think I'm still on red.
[36:42.100 --> 36:42.660]  Right here.
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.180]  No, let's go to red.
[36:44.180 --> 36:44.820]  Right here.
[36:46.100 --> 36:47.540]  This is far red.
[36:49.700 --> 36:51.300]  If I can get that up here.
[36:51.460 --> 36:52.820]  If I can get that up here.
[36:54.580 --> 36:55.540]  FR.
[36:56.260 --> 36:56.580]  Far red.
[36:56.580 --> 37:00.740]  That is out here to 750 nanometers.
[37:00.740 --> 37:01.940]  This zone right here.
[37:02.740 --> 37:05.540]  Our eyes have trouble seeing this.
[37:05.540 --> 37:12.420]  It's just like a dull glow of a red burner on a stove, of an electric burner.
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.580]  You couldn't really read a book by this.
[37:15.300 --> 37:20.660]  But it has powerful effects on plants, and it adds 750.
[37:21.300 --> 37:25.780]  Our data indicate that these photons cause photosynthesis.
[37:25.780 --> 37:29.300]  They certainly cause changes in plant shape.
[37:29.300 --> 37:30.980]  We can make plants branch more.
[37:31.940 --> 37:34.580]  We usually make them taller with more far red.
[37:35.300 --> 37:37.300]  But these photons are critical.
[37:37.860 --> 37:42.660]  Because of that, well, let me, before you get to that, let's talk about the other end down here.
[37:42.660 --> 37:42.980]  Blue.
[37:44.500 --> 37:50.100]  These photons, especially 350, 300 nanometers.
[37:50.820 --> 37:53.460]  This, of course, is all ultraviolet.
[37:53.460 --> 37:55.140]  Our eyes don't see this.
[37:55.140 --> 37:59.300]  Historically, electric lights, we try to get rid of this.
[37:59.300 --> 38:00.580]  We try to get rid of this.
[38:00.580 --> 38:02.660]  They're not useful for human lighting.
[38:02.660 --> 38:11.780]  But they have powerful effects on plants, especially this region at 350, right here, of UV.
[38:11.780 --> 38:16.180]  Our data indicate these photons cause photosynthesis as well.
[38:16.820 --> 38:23.540]  So I think we're going to see an emerging change in the definition of photosynthetic radiation,
[38:23.540 --> 38:26.340]  maybe from 350 to 750.
[38:26.340 --> 38:26.900]  We'll see.
[38:26.900 --> 38:29.140]  Multiple laboratories are studying this.
[38:29.700 --> 38:37.940]  Because of this, Apogee has come out with what we call an extended range quantum sensor.
[38:37.940 --> 38:44.020]  And that is a sensor that measures everything from 350, way out here.
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.820]  It picks up, here's security cameras.
[38:46.820 --> 38:48.420]  They have a big peak out here.
[38:49.140 --> 38:52.260]  That's centered around 830 nanometers.
[38:53.460 --> 38:56.100]  That extended range picks up all these photons.
[38:56.100 --> 39:00.020]  And for some kinds of lights, these photons are critical.
[39:00.020 --> 39:01.860]  You want to know what they are.
[39:01.860 --> 39:05.060]  Even though the classic quantum sensor doesn't include them,
[39:06.020 --> 39:10.660]  the Apogee extended range quantum sensor does include them.
[39:10.660 --> 39:16.740]  So UV photons have the potential to reduce disease in plants.
[39:16.740 --> 39:22.020]  They have the potential to trigger cannabinoid synthesis in plants.
[39:22.020 --> 39:29.860]  So we're putting a lot of energy into studying the potential use of UV photons in the plants.
[39:29.860 --> 39:31.860]  Again, stay tuned.
[39:31.860 --> 39:32.660]  And one more thing.
[39:33.540 --> 39:37.780]  We get a lot of questions about optimum ratios of colors
[39:38.420 --> 39:42.420]  for both growth and photosynthesis and for cannabinoids.
[39:43.300 --> 39:48.580]  And let me fall back on the one principle here that has guided us.
[39:49.300 --> 39:53.140]  And that's the percent blue photons.
[39:53.140 --> 39:56.980]  And let's do this in a different screen.
[39:58.340 --> 39:59.300]  Here's my marker.
[40:00.100 --> 40:05.380]  For years, before we had LEDs, people said,
[40:05.380 --> 40:15.200]  you want to do metal halide for VEG.
[40:15.760 --> 40:17.680]  V-E-G.
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.040]  Before they became reproductive.
[40:23.040 --> 40:30.080]  And you would typically be giving, oh, maybe even an 18-hour photo period during that time,
[40:30.080 --> 40:31.040]  during VEG.
[40:31.280 --> 40:45.040]  Then the prevailing wisdom was to switch to high pressure sodium during the reproductive phase.
[40:45.680 --> 40:48.160]  And look, that's flowering.
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.560]  Now, many people said, oh, God, that's all a myth.
[40:56.560 --> 40:58.800]  And not exactly.
[40:59.760 --> 41:10.640]  Metal halide has 30% blue photons.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.320]  This is having trouble.
[41:16.880 --> 41:18.080]  30% blue.
[41:20.080 --> 41:24.160]  The higher the blue photons, the more compact the plant.
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.840]  So metal halide was very effective at making nice, compact plants.
[41:30.480 --> 41:39.760]  High pressure sodium, on the other hand, only has about 4% blue photons.
[41:41.280 --> 41:43.440]  Sunlight has about 30% blue.
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.160]  They switched to high pressure sodium because it's a much more efficient light.
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.440]  And you can get bright intensity, but it had low blue.
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.400]  But the blue didn't matter so much during flowering because the flowers kept the plants
[41:56.400 --> 41:57.200]  short.
[41:57.200 --> 42:03.040]  So there was a reason to go with a high blue light during VEG,
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.600]  and then a very efficient light during flowering.
[42:08.240 --> 42:10.880]  And we've seen that in cannabis.
[42:10.880 --> 42:18.000]  It's a ratio of blue photons for plant height, and then the efficiency of the light after that.
[42:18.560 --> 42:24.240]  So what we like to see are very efficient lights.
[42:24.880 --> 42:28.080]  The ratios of colors are less critical.
[42:28.960 --> 42:37.120]  We do like to see lights with enough green photons so you can diagnose plant disorders.
[42:37.120 --> 42:40.960]  Those green photons usually come from white LEDs.
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.680]  It's important to look for microscopic insects, subtle disorders.
[42:45.680 --> 42:48.560]  You got to be able to see the plants to do that.
[42:48.560 --> 42:51.920]  But after that, it's just the efficiency of the light.
[42:52.880 --> 42:59.840]  If you search for Design Light Consortium on the internet, the acronym is DLC,
[43:02.320 --> 43:10.400]  that is an independent company that has now been listing lights from many manufacturers
[43:11.040 --> 43:17.920]  and their test results from independent test laboratories for the efficiency of the light.
[43:18.800 --> 43:22.560]  The unit for light efficiency, I'm running out of room,
[43:24.080 --> 43:36.640]  is, put this over here, is micromoles of photons out per joule of electricity in.
[43:37.600 --> 43:43.920]  The really efficient lights, LEDs, are now getting up to 2.5 micromoles per joule,
[43:43.920 --> 43:45.200]  and even higher than that.
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.240]  They're incredibly efficient.
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.040]  Ten years ago, we were half of that efficiency for lights.
[43:53.680 --> 43:59.280]  But it's critical to get an efficient light and a broad spectrum light
[43:59.280 --> 44:02.160]  so you get enough colors to see the plants.
[44:03.040 --> 44:04.880]  Thanks for listening.
