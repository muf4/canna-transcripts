[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments and professor of crop physiology at Utah State
[00:07.840 --> 00:08.840]  University.
[00:08.840 --> 00:19.200]  Today we're going to talk about new sensors from Apogee and particularly an extended range
[00:19.200 --> 00:20.480]  quantum sensor.
[00:20.480 --> 00:23.960]  We call that an ePAR sensor.
[00:23.960 --> 00:29.240]  I'm first going to show you the sensors and the model numbers and then I'm going to go
[00:29.240 --> 00:33.640]  through why Apogee developed these sensors.
[00:33.640 --> 00:41.200]  It comes from new research on the effects of spectra on photosynthesis.
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.400]  So let's take a look at these sensors here.
[00:45.400 --> 00:53.320]  These are extended photon flux density and the new one we call ePAR.
[00:53.320 --> 01:00.120]  Now these are similar price, but look what happens.
[01:00.120 --> 01:07.600]  Let's take this and put the pen on green here.
[01:07.600 --> 01:15.240]  First of all, photosynthesis, we say it starts at 400, it stops at 700, and it's equal in
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.680]  between.
[01:16.680 --> 01:23.260]  So this area right in here is classic photosynthetic radiation.
[01:23.260 --> 01:31.220]  We've used that for a half a century since the days of Keith McCree as pioneering work.
[01:31.220 --> 01:35.620]  This is called PPFD.
[01:35.620 --> 01:42.540]  I know I just wrote over that, but photosynthetic photon flux density.
[01:42.540 --> 01:46.460]  And this is the classic Apogee sensor.
[01:46.460 --> 01:49.500]  This sensor is a big seller for Apogee.
[01:49.700 --> 02:00.060]  This one, let me put it under here, model 500.
[02:00.060 --> 02:06.700]  That's the classic sensor that measures this radiation that I just drew in here.
[02:06.700 --> 02:10.540]  So why do we have other sensors if that's the classic sensor?
[02:10.540 --> 02:19.220]  There are emerging definitions of photosynthetic radiation that I'm going to talk about.
[02:19.220 --> 02:26.860]  First of all, as most people know, here it is right here, UV radiation right here.
[02:26.860 --> 02:31.160]  This has some photosynthetic effects, not many but some.
[02:31.160 --> 02:32.900]  I'll talk about them.
[02:32.900 --> 02:38.780]  This radiation out here is far-red after 700.
[02:38.780 --> 02:44.020]  This has significant photosynthetic effects, and I'm going to talk about those in detail
[02:44.020 --> 02:50.420]  in the next few minutes, which is why we've developed sensors to do this.
[02:50.420 --> 03:02.260]  Now, this radiation out here is called extended PFD, and Apogee has sold that sensor now for about a year.
[03:02.260 --> 03:10.100]  It goes all the way out to 1000 nanometers, and LED lights don't have any radiation out here,
[03:10.100 --> 03:11.500]  so it doesn't measure them.
[03:11.500 --> 03:16.940]  Sunlight has lots of radiation, so you can't use that sensor in sunlight.
[03:16.940 --> 03:24.300]  The breakthrough is Apogee developed a cutoff filter to cut this off right here,
[03:24.300 --> 03:35.980]  about 750 nanometers, so that it now gets, and now we got to show that in red, because it's far-red,
[03:35.980 --> 03:40.860]  it now gets this amount of radiation in here.
[03:40.860 --> 03:51.180]  This is a big deal, because there is a far-red LED that many manufacturers, most even, are adding to their lights,
[03:51.180 --> 03:58.860]  and the classic sensor doesn't catch those photons, doesn't show them at all, and they cause photosynthesis.
[03:58.860 --> 04:07.180]  So with this new sensor, which, you know, we're working on catchy titles, so this is extended,
[04:07.260 --> 04:18.460]  lowercase e, extended PAR, model 6, SQ610, that's the one that captures this extra radiation out here.
[04:22.940 --> 04:32.220]  There is another Apogee sensor, I'll show this first, that we call the PAR,
[04:32.220 --> 04:41.660]  for photosynthetic radiation right here, and the FAR, for the far-red radiation right here.
[04:43.260 --> 04:49.180]  This sensor has two detectors in it, and it measures these separately.
[04:49.180 --> 05:01.900]  It measures the classic PPFD, I'm going to write that up here, classic photosynthetic photon flux density,
[05:01.900 --> 05:08.300]  and it also measures the far-red. Now this sensor, of course, can add those two numbers together
[05:08.300 --> 05:17.500]  to give you a total, but it does them separately. This is a terrific sensor, way cheaper than a
[05:17.500 --> 05:25.660]  spectral radiometer, and it separately measures these two types of radiation. It is about 25% more money
[05:25.660 --> 05:33.980]  than the other sensors. So save up, you could buy the classic, or right now, we'll go back,
[05:33.980 --> 05:39.740]  you could buy either of these for a little bit more, and they're simple to use, a single number.
[05:42.140 --> 05:50.300]  Now these are the sensors. What we call an instrument means a sensor connected to a meter,
[05:51.180 --> 05:57.660]  and now I'm going to review the two types of meters that Apogee sells, because it's a package.
[05:58.540 --> 06:04.860]  For many, many years, Apogee has sold this classic meter. There's the on button right there,
[06:04.860 --> 06:12.780]  couldn't be simpler to use. You grab it, you push on button. This one does record, but it's not very
[06:12.780 --> 06:21.340]  elegant for recording. It's mostly people use it for instantaneous measurements. And MQ means
[06:21.340 --> 06:28.220]  meter quantum. So there's the meter quantum with 610, and the meter quantum with 620. That's the
[06:28.220 --> 06:36.620]  classic package. To make the jump to light speed with this, about a year ago Apogee introduced
[06:37.500 --> 06:49.900]  a microcache with Bluetooth. So now the same sensors plug into this, and it records data for
[06:51.180 --> 06:59.900]  long time, over a year. But it also displays the data to your phone with the Apogee app that comes
[06:59.900 --> 07:06.460]  with it. When we go to the lab, I'm old school, right? We're just going to make a quick measurement
[07:06.460 --> 07:11.580]  I grab this meter because it has one on button. My students laugh at me. They say, get with the
[07:11.580 --> 07:17.420]  program. Just get your phone out and look at all the data you can collect so fast. All the students,
[07:17.420 --> 07:21.420]  if this meter is sitting on the counter, they say, where's the microcache? That's the one I want to
[07:21.420 --> 07:26.780]  use. That has more data. They can put that in a growth chamber, close the door, and measure what's
[07:26.780 --> 07:34.060]  going on inside. For me, I get to run the cable through the door, and it's a mess. So this is an
[07:34.060 --> 07:42.060]  up-and-coming instrument because of the ability to record. It shows both instantaneous and
[07:42.060 --> 07:49.660]  long-term. There's the picture. I have one here, a little microcache. I didn't plan to show it with
[07:49.660 --> 07:56.940]  my phone, but there's some of the histograms. Here's the PARFAR sensor, and here's the
[07:57.820 --> 08:04.700]  the new sensor in a silver housing. You can tell the sensors apart because of their
[08:05.580 --> 08:15.100]  colors, distinctive colors. All right, this is the end of the section on the new sensors. Let's just
[08:15.100 --> 08:22.380]  review this, and now I'm going to go into why it's important to measure these.
[08:23.340 --> 08:31.980]  So just to review, the old classic is extended. It gets this radiation out in here.
[08:32.540 --> 08:43.740]  The improvement to that really is this ePAR sensor, model 610. Then we go to the next one,
[08:44.300 --> 08:51.100]  the PARFAR sensor, so red and far-red separately. If you can afford it, this is a great sensor.
[08:51.900 --> 08:56.780]  But this one doesn't work with a meter, by the way. It's got two outputs, so a single meter.
[08:56.780 --> 09:04.860]  You have to use this with the microcache. And then there's the options for the meters. Okay,
[09:05.900 --> 09:13.260]  now I want to talk about why we want to measure these different types of radiation. And this is
[09:13.260 --> 09:18.540]  a much longer part of this talk, but you can skip around in the video to the parts you want.
[09:19.500 --> 09:25.900]  I like to call this towards an optimal spectral quality for plant growth and development.
[09:27.180 --> 09:32.060]  And this is the name of textbooks, but when we say plant growth, we really mean
[09:32.060 --> 09:39.180]  direct effects on photosynthesis. The dry weight of the plant gets bigger. When we say development,
[09:39.180 --> 09:47.740]  we mean plant shape. The plant, tall spindly, short fat, we can manipulate shape with quality
[09:47.740 --> 09:53.180]  of light, and we want to know how the quality of light affects photosynthesis.
[09:54.620 --> 10:01.660]  Plants sometimes get big because we change their leaf shape. If you can make a bigger leaf with
[10:01.660 --> 10:08.700]  light quality, it captures more light, and the photosynthesis per unit leaf area is really the
[10:08.700 --> 10:15.500]  same. So this is a tricky thing, and I keep coming back to this. Plant growth and development,
[10:15.500 --> 10:25.740]  photosynthesis, and shape or morphology of the plant. This is very significant because in my
[10:25.740 --> 10:32.060]  laboratory at Utah State University, we have been working on these two parameters full-time to get
[10:32.060 --> 10:42.060]  them right. Shuyang Zhan and I have published two papers just in the last year on this exact topic,
[10:42.060 --> 10:48.380]  and this is primarily on the effects of wavelengths of light on photosynthesis.
[10:48.940 --> 10:55.660]  They're in these two papers. We'll put these in green. They're in Plant Cell and Environment
[10:55.660 --> 11:02.060]  and Frontiers in Plant Science, two of our most prestigious high-impact journals. They have long
[11:02.060 --> 11:08.940]  titles. You can pause this and look at the titles or just search on Shuyang Zhan and Bugbee, and
[11:08.940 --> 11:14.540]  you'll find the papers will come right up in Google Scholar. Both of them are on effects of
[11:14.540 --> 11:22.620]  photosynthesis. This science is what led to the ePAR sensor. We could see the need for a sensor
[11:22.620 --> 11:29.420]  based on this work. Here's Shuyang Zhan, and I'm very pleased to announce that she has now
[11:30.060 --> 11:36.860]  accepted a position as an assistant professor at Texas A&M University. She's going to be continuing
[11:36.860 --> 11:47.100]  this work there. It's very exciting work because it fundamentally changes the definition of what we
[11:47.100 --> 11:54.540]  call photosynthetic radiation. We couldn't have done this work without funding from both NASA
[11:54.540 --> 12:01.900]  and the USDA, and I want to acknowledge their help. For NASA, we're growing plants on Mars and a life
[12:02.540 --> 12:10.940]  colony on Mars, and for USDA, back to Earth. This is the LAMP project, Lighting Approaches to Maximize
[12:10.940 --> 12:18.220]  Profit. So it's a very applied, focused project for greenhouses and growth chambers on Earth. We're
[12:19.180 --> 12:24.380]  very grateful to have this funding to be able to do this work. All right, let's take a closer look
[12:24.380 --> 12:32.780]  at this. If we're going to change the definition of photosynthetic radiation, which has been for
[12:32.780 --> 12:41.500]  years and years 400 to 700 nanometers. We make students memorize those numbers over and over
[12:41.500 --> 12:47.660]  again. Those are the wavelengths of photosynthesis. Now we're going to, I'll put this in yellow,
[12:47.660 --> 13:02.380]  400 to 750, another 50 nanometers. I love this quote from Carl Sagan in Cosmos,
[13:03.100 --> 13:10.860]  extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. This is an extraordinary claim. We're going to
[13:10.860 --> 13:15.260]  change this definition. The old sensors aren't going to capture that radiation,
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.420]  so here's the extraordinary proof.
[13:19.820 --> 13:27.260]  These are two slides that, into the weeds, on the biochemistry of photosynthesis. This isn't just
[13:28.300 --> 13:35.260]  an experimental measurement. It's supplemented with a lot of detailed theoretical considerations,
[13:35.260 --> 13:42.140]  and I'll walk you through this. This is a gorgeous slide made by my colleague, Mark Van Irsel,
[13:43.100 --> 13:50.140]  who is a professor at the University of Georgia. Shu Yang Zhen, by the way, got her PhD with Mark
[13:50.140 --> 13:55.740]  working on this stuff, and then she came to my lab as a postdoc, and now she's a professor.
[13:56.780 --> 14:05.100]  This is out of Molecular Cell Biology, 6th edition. This is a textbook, but Mark has annotated this
[14:05.100 --> 14:12.380]  with what happens to a photon, and this is a wonderful little animation. Here comes a photon,
[14:12.380 --> 14:19.900]  boom, it hits, it's absorbed. It's a reaction center, this right here, electron. Boom,
[14:19.900 --> 14:29.020]  that excites the electron, moves up to a higher excitation level. Then more photons come,
[14:29.980 --> 14:38.620]  hits an absorption site over here, and that then moves that electron, boom, all the way up to there,
[14:38.620 --> 14:46.780]  all the way from the sun to here, to here, to here, to here, out. That's called the light
[14:46.780 --> 14:57.580]  reactions of photosynthesis, and those reactions make adenosine, triphosphate, and NADPH. That's
[14:57.580 --> 15:02.860]  the light reactions of photosynthesis, and if you can answer that on a test, you're ready to
[15:02.860 --> 15:11.740]  graduate. This is a detailed light reactions. Now, that is a lot of biochemistry, and I really like
[15:11.740 --> 15:21.100]  physics more than chemistry, so I made a different diagram, and you can be the judge of which one's
[15:21.100 --> 15:29.900]  more easier to understand. We know from Albert Einstein and the Stark-Einstein law, one photon
[15:29.900 --> 15:37.740]  excites one electron. That's what Mark's diagram just showed us, but now I've got workers on towers
[15:37.740 --> 15:44.460]  more than the biochemistry of this. Here's the sun, right, so we're going to show the sun here,
[15:45.340 --> 15:48.140]  same as the other one. Sun is always smiling.
[15:50.300 --> 15:58.140]  Photons come in, boom, this guy hits this platform with the hammer, the electron goes up here,
[15:58.860 --> 16:04.940]  another worker catches it. Note that there's male workers here and female workers. I'm doing the
[16:04.940 --> 16:14.220]  skilled positions at the top. They put it in here, it turns a mill, and it makes ATP, the energy for
[16:14.220 --> 16:20.460]  photosynthesis. Another photon comes in, this one's coming in this way, boom,
[16:22.140 --> 16:29.420]  sends it up here, another worker puts it in a bucket, and we get NADPH. This is called photosystem
[16:29.420 --> 16:36.380]  two and photosystem one. We knew what one first, that's why they're backwards, two happens before
[16:36.380 --> 16:43.900]  one. But it takes photons from both sides to do this, to fully excite all the electrons for
[16:43.900 --> 16:53.580]  photosynthesis. Now we have known for over 50 years that this worker right here can be excited with
[16:53.580 --> 17:01.740]  far-red photons above 700 nanometers. But you can see if this guy was the only one that was excited,
[17:01.740 --> 17:06.620]  this system wouldn't work because you got to have this side. You got to have him going up here,
[17:06.620 --> 17:14.380]  and then he does the second jump. This is synergism, and we've tried with far-red
[17:14.380 --> 17:18.780]  light and it does nothing. And we say, well that's no good. We got to have visible light.
[17:19.420 --> 17:26.860]  When we apply them both at the same time together, this guy is excited, this one is excited,
[17:26.860 --> 17:36.300]  and the whole system is more synergistic. Now Shu Young worked on this in Georgia and showed
[17:36.300 --> 17:42.700]  that there was less heat produced when she gave plants far-red light. When she came to Utah,
[17:43.740 --> 17:49.660]  we started, this is called the Emerson enhancement effect because it was shown by Emerson.
[17:50.220 --> 17:57.580]  Amazingly enough, in the 1950s, when Emerson, and then he was tragically killed in a crash of a
[17:57.580 --> 18:02.780]  small plane, and no one ever followed up his work. It's an amazing story in science.
[18:04.380 --> 18:12.780]  So Shu Young comes along and we start doing canopy photosynthesis. Whole canopies of plants in a
[18:12.780 --> 18:20.460]  closed box. You can measure photosynthesis. And we get this classic curve with 400 to 700. This
[18:20.460 --> 18:28.940]  was with lettuce now, and it starts here at zero, goes up like this. And we three points in this
[18:28.940 --> 18:37.580]  curve. When we gave them far-red light, photosynthesis went up, but right here, this is 400
[18:37.580 --> 18:43.740]  to 700. We weren't counting it, right? You don't count those photons. Whoa, but it made photosynthesis
[18:43.740 --> 18:55.660]  go up. These are different levels. So what Shu Young did, graph this 400 to 750 nanometers. She
[18:55.660 --> 19:02.460]  counted it. Here it is. And look, all the data follows one nice smooth curve because we're
[19:02.460 --> 19:09.420]  counting all the photons. When we got these experimental results, we went, wow, this is
[19:09.420 --> 19:17.100]  beautiful. But so far, we've only shown it in lettuce. What about other crops? Shu Young did
[19:17.100 --> 19:25.020]  17 crops. Spinach, basil, kale, sunflower, corn. You can see them all on here. And this is a picture
[19:25.020 --> 19:31.500]  of the plants in the chambers, one at a time. To make a long story short, every crop did the exact
[19:31.500 --> 19:39.260]  same thing. So this effect of far-red photons is universal for many kinds of crops.
[19:40.060 --> 19:47.420]  This led to what I'd like to say is going to become a landmark publication in plant cell and
[19:47.420 --> 19:55.420]  environment from this work. But we kept going. We kept working on this. The second paper, which is
[19:55.420 --> 20:01.500]  now published in Frontiers and Plant Science, looked at what we call quantum yield over the
[20:01.500 --> 20:10.300]  long term. So this was like several weeks of a lettuce crop. And quantum yield is, we have it
[20:10.300 --> 20:17.660]  right here, moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons absorbed. It's a very precise measurement
[20:17.660 --> 20:27.980]  of photosynthetic efficiency. And here's 350, 350. These are, this is micromoles. I'll put it over
[20:27.980 --> 20:39.260]  here. Micromoles per meter squared per second. That's PPFT. Note that this one had 350. This one
[20:39.260 --> 20:47.740]  only had 300. So this one should have been much less. But we added 50 of far-red. So the sum of
[20:47.740 --> 20:55.340]  these two is the same. And the quantum yield is the same. Down here, this was with RB as a red-blue
[20:55.340 --> 21:01.740]  background, like purple light. And it was the same with purple light. Then we also did the same thing
[21:01.740 --> 21:12.060]  with white light, 350 and 300 plus 50. And the lines are the same. That's compelling evidence that
[21:12.060 --> 21:19.340]  far-red photons are equally good to traditional photosynthetic photons. And that's the underlying
[21:19.340 --> 21:26.620]  reason we need a sensor that includes them, particularly for LEDs. Because all those LEDs
[21:26.620 --> 21:35.100]  have far-red photons now and we need to measure them. So that EPAR sensor includes these.
[21:37.340 --> 21:46.860]  So there's the classic. There's the new, 750. The EPAR sensor, if you look at this,
[21:47.260 --> 21:59.340]  includes some photons here. Those are UV photons. And now I'm going to briefly talk about what UV
[21:59.340 --> 22:06.780]  does. And I'm going to base it both on McCree's data and our data. Remember Keith McCree,
[22:08.140 --> 22:12.860]  who he's a wonderful guy. I had as a young scientist, I had a chance to meet him.
[22:12.860 --> 22:20.220]  And he said, Bruce, what are you working on? And I told him. And, oh no, first he said, Bruce,
[22:20.220 --> 22:24.940]  what's the most important question in your discipline? And I said, oh yeah, it's probably this.
[22:24.940 --> 22:28.380]  And he said, what are you working on? And I told him. And he says, why aren't you working on the
[22:28.380 --> 22:35.100]  most important thing in your discipline? Get back to the lab. Get to work. It was really inspiring.
[22:35.100 --> 22:41.500]  So he gave us this. Now we're adding on this. What about right here? Is this a sharp cutoff
[22:41.580 --> 22:49.180]  right at 400? This is particularly important because now we have LEDs right in this region,
[22:49.180 --> 22:55.500]  right here. I'm going to show you these LEDs and show you why this end is also important.
[22:57.100 --> 23:08.620]  Here's four colors of LEDs. I'll put this one in blue. This one we call violet. We don't have the
[23:08.620 --> 23:19.020]  names on here. But violet is really quite an efficient LED. And it's right on the edge. Right
[23:19.020 --> 23:27.980]  here we call it UV. And look at this. A big part of that sensor is really UV radiation.
[23:27.980 --> 23:35.980]  Do these cause photosynthesis? Yeah, let's take a look. Are these efficient over here? This sensor
[23:35.980 --> 23:44.380]  is just inside of UV radiation. But 2.22 micromoles per joule, that's an efficient LED.
[23:44.380 --> 23:52.540]  If this does unique things, we need to be putting this in fixtures. These three are primarily UV.
[23:53.260 --> 24:00.700]  This one, though, has a tail in the visible. So this is why we need to know exactly what's going
[24:00.700 --> 24:10.140]  on right here with photosynthesis. Look what happens. 65% efficient. Excellent. Ah, 58, 57, 49.
[24:10.140 --> 24:15.420]  These become less efficient. But if they have unique effects, we need to be using them.
[24:17.660 --> 24:24.220]  This one is becoming increasingly used. These three are still emerging possibilities. But if
[24:24.220 --> 24:32.940]  we can show they help, fixture manufacturers will use them. Here's the same graph just shown
[24:32.940 --> 24:43.180]  on a bigger scale. This is UVC down here, which we're also studying. This is very damaging,
[24:43.180 --> 24:48.700]  but you just give trace amounts and it has the potential to do good things. So here's the same
[24:48.700 --> 24:56.620]  thing. The peak heights are proportional to their efficiencies or their efficacies. This is the
[24:56.620 --> 25:06.220]  standard blue right here. 450 nanometers. White LEDs start from this. This is very common in all
[25:06.220 --> 25:14.620]  fixtures. Here's the violet right here. We'll put V for violet. And then the three wavelengths of UV.
[25:15.420 --> 25:22.620]  What do they do to plants? Here's McCree's curve that everybody shows this and we look at it over
[25:22.620 --> 25:29.500]  and over again. What we just talked about, shown in red, is this curve right here.
[25:31.180 --> 25:40.620]  We've now got compelling evidence that we need to shift this. What about this end? Look at the tail
[25:40.620 --> 25:48.300]  on this end and compare it to those three LED curves. What does this look like? Let's take a
[25:48.300 --> 25:56.220]  deeper dive into McCree's original papers on this to look at what the photosynthesis looked like.
[25:57.420 --> 26:08.940]  This is a graph we made from McCree's data. And here is 400 nanometers right there.
[26:09.900 --> 26:18.700]  These are plants from the field and they sparingly use that UV light. The growth chamber plants, wow,
[26:18.700 --> 26:25.980]  look at this. The growth chamber plants use the UV light. I used to think this was because
[26:26.700 --> 26:31.020]  they weren't used to UV and they didn't filter it out and they used it all the time.
[26:31.020 --> 26:37.740]  But on closer inspection of his data, coupled with our own data of measurements of plants,
[26:38.700 --> 26:45.500]  now we know this is just, it was just chance they have used different species here in the growth
[26:45.500 --> 26:50.220]  chamber and the field. It isn't because they were grown in the growth chamber, he just used
[26:50.220 --> 26:55.980]  different species. Let's take a look at this. There's the UV that we're talking about.
[26:55.980 --> 27:03.180]  Look at the big error bars in here. This is a fascinating area of study. Here's an example.
[27:03.900 --> 27:11.260]  Lettuce and cucumber, both two high value common species. Here's 400 right there.
[27:12.860 --> 27:23.100]  Cucumber minimally uses UV light. Lettuce uses a lot of UV light. It's much more effectively uses
[27:23.100 --> 27:31.500]  those UV photons. Now I could show you all the other crops we've studied, but sunflowers is one
[27:31.500 --> 27:36.620]  that, sunflowers is actually pretty bad. Sunflowers, you'd think they were good. Some
[27:36.620 --> 27:43.340]  species are even more out here, but there's a big range of curves in the UV among species.
[27:45.740 --> 27:55.180]  So for this reason, and I'll stop, we've got one more summary slide. For this reason,
[27:56.060 --> 28:06.780]  we have made, this is the old data from McCree where it cuts off here. The new sensor comes out
[28:06.780 --> 28:14.380]  here, comes across at one, all the way across, and then it doesn't have a sharp cutoff. It counts
[28:15.180 --> 28:22.220]  some of these UV photons, has a tapering response there. So the big advantage is a little bit of UV
[28:22.220 --> 28:33.980]  right here and a bunch of far red there. That's the ePAR sensor. Now I'm going to close with a
[28:33.980 --> 28:43.260]  slide that summarizes all the types of light on plants. Blue photons inhibit cell expansion. They
[28:43.260 --> 28:51.020]  make plants small and compact. Green photons, they're fine for photosynthesis, but they're
[28:51.020 --> 28:56.620]  really important for human vision. If we have green photons, you can see the plants. Red photons
[28:56.620 --> 29:03.340]  are terrific, efficient photosynthesis. Our fixtures have a lot of red photons. Far red photons do the
[29:03.340 --> 29:09.580]  opposite of blue. This inhibits cell expansion. These promote it. So as we go into the future,
[29:09.580 --> 29:15.260]  we're going to be going back and forth between inhibiting and enhancing cell expansion with
[29:15.260 --> 29:23.180]  these colors of light to shape the plant with photobiology. Here's an example. This happens to
[29:23.180 --> 29:32.700]  be cannabis, 5% blue, 20%. We shrunk the plant. Everything else was identical here. And generally,
[29:32.700 --> 29:41.260]  a nice compact plant is a good thing, but this plant is also a little bit wider than that plant
[29:41.260 --> 29:47.740]  and it captures more light. You can see how. Now we could put far red, if I do that in red,
[29:48.620 --> 29:55.980]  if we put far red in here, this is going to look just like that with more blue. It's a fascinating
[29:55.980 --> 30:03.260]  ability to manipulate plant shape. Human vision, you can see the green. This is white LEDs. You
[30:03.260 --> 30:09.580]  can see the plants. There you can. That's significant. Here's far red light and lettuce.
[30:09.580 --> 30:17.180]  It's tremendously valuable. Look at that. 10% far red leaf expansion. It's really valuable for lettuce.
[30:18.060 --> 30:26.460]  Unfortunately, the far red light makes most plants significantly taller. So we have to be very
[30:26.460 --> 30:35.020]  careful how we use it because it can easily make, well, tall skinny plants instead of short compact
[30:35.020 --> 30:40.540]  plants. This is all in front of us manipulating far red, putting it on at the right place and the
[30:40.540 --> 30:47.820]  right time and the right crop, but it's a very powerful tool and that new EPR sensor now measures
[30:47.820 --> 30:52.860]  it. Thanks for listening. We'll talk to you again in another video.
