[00:01.660 --> 00:24.040]  I'm going to talk about net radiation,
[00:24.040 --> 00:26.360]  specifically the four components and
[00:26.360 --> 00:29.040]  then selection among sensors. Bruce will
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.720]  talk a bit about radiation frost and
[00:32.720 --> 00:35.040]  non-destructive measurements of leaf
[00:35.040 --> 00:36.440]  chlorophyll and then I'll talk about
[00:36.440 --> 00:39.600]  hyperspectral reflectance. If we get
[00:39.600 --> 00:42.640]  that far and if people are interested we
[00:42.640 --> 00:45.480]  can speak a bit about soil oxygen and
[00:45.480 --> 00:47.960]  barometric pressure but we'll just see
[00:47.960 --> 00:49.960]  where we're at after we get to the end
[00:49.960 --> 00:53.160]  of the reflected stuff.
[00:53.160 --> 00:58.080]  As long as interest is still there
[00:58.080 --> 01:02.280]  people's eyes are open at that point.
[01:02.280 --> 01:05.800]  As before if you have any questions
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.640]  please feel free to ask. I don't have
[01:09.640 --> 01:11.880]  that many slides this time I might make
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.560]  use of the of the board. A lot of what
[01:16.560 --> 01:18.600]  we've covered already when we talked
[01:18.600 --> 01:21.800]  about pyranometers and infrared
[01:21.800 --> 01:26.040]  radiometers relates directly to net
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.560]  radiometers, the instruments that we use
[01:28.560 --> 01:31.560]  to measure net radiation. We won't
[01:31.560 --> 01:33.840]  talk maybe as much about principles of
[01:33.840 --> 01:39.180]  sensors in the net radiation
[01:39.180 --> 01:46.300]  section. Net radiation is just the
[01:46.300 --> 01:49.620]  difference between incoming radiation at
[01:49.620 --> 01:52.620]  the surface and outgoing radiation at
[01:52.620 --> 01:55.420]  the surface. There are both short wave
[01:55.420 --> 01:58.460]  and long wave components that we have to
[01:58.460 --> 02:02.960]  consider. I passed out a magnet if you
[02:02.960 --> 02:04.740]  don't have one there's more down here
[02:04.740 --> 02:06.380]  and you're free to take one that has the
[02:06.380 --> 02:08.860]  exact same picture that you that you see
[02:09.020 --> 02:11.860]  right here. These are typical values of
[02:11.860 --> 02:14.660]  the four different components that make
[02:14.660 --> 02:17.100]  up net radiation. This would be
[02:17.100 --> 02:20.700]  representative of a clear summer day
[02:20.700 --> 02:25.060]  over vegetation near solar noon so when
[02:25.060 --> 02:28.140]  the Sun is in the middle of the sky.
[02:28.140 --> 02:30.580]  The largest component of net radiation
[02:30.580 --> 02:34.860]  is the incoming shortwave component 100
[02:34.860 --> 02:37.300]  watts per meter squared is a reasonable
[02:37.340 --> 02:41.860]  value for midday in the summertime. Then
[02:41.860 --> 02:45.860]  the vegetation or soil whatever is at
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.980]  the surface in the summertime usually
[02:47.980 --> 02:50.660]  it's vegetation is a good absorber of
[02:50.660 --> 02:53.700]  shortwave radiation. A much smaller
[02:53.700 --> 02:57.580]  amount is being reflected about 200 watts
[02:57.580 --> 03:00.100]  per meter squared is a good estimate
[03:00.100 --> 03:04.340]  for vegetation. The difference between
[03:04.380 --> 03:07.700]  these two the incoming shortwave minus
[03:07.700 --> 03:10.980]  the outgoing shortwave is net shortwave.
[03:10.980 --> 03:14.820]  We have a positive value of 800 watts
[03:14.820 --> 03:17.240]  per meter squared net shortwave at the
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.260]  surface. A term that you're probably all
[03:21.260 --> 03:24.660]  familiar with is albedo. That's the
[03:24.660 --> 03:28.500]  broadband shortwave reflectivity and so
[03:28.500 --> 03:30.740]  essentially it's just the ratio of these
[03:30.740 --> 03:33.660]  two numbers. In our example it would be 200
[03:33.780 --> 03:37.780]  by 1000 so it's the reflected shortwave
[03:37.780 --> 03:40.580]  divided by the incoming shortwave. That
[03:40.580 --> 03:43.580]  would be 0.2 or 20 percent. That's a
[03:43.580 --> 03:45.900]  really reasonable value for green
[03:45.900 --> 03:49.540]  vegetation when the Sun is in the middle
[03:49.540 --> 03:52.900]  of the sky. Now we switch over to the
[03:52.900 --> 03:55.100]  longwave side. We also have an incoming
[03:55.100 --> 03:57.380]  longwave component and an emitted
[03:57.380 --> 04:01.020]  longwave component. If the sky is
[04:01.020 --> 04:02.980]  cloud-free and a lot of you are just
[04:03.100 --> 04:06.820]  outside with me pointing infrared sensors
[04:06.820 --> 04:09.100]  up and measuring the sky was quite cold
[04:09.100 --> 04:11.780]  but we found that the clouds were a bit
[04:11.780 --> 04:18.180]  warmer than the blue sky. The
[04:18.180 --> 04:21.260]  sky is emitting longwave radiation
[04:21.260 --> 04:23.980]  towards the surface and the surface is
[04:23.980 --> 04:25.820]  emitting longwave radiation back
[04:25.820 --> 04:28.140]  towards the sky. The reason the
[04:28.140 --> 04:30.860]  incoming radiation from the sky is lower
[04:30.940 --> 04:33.620]  than the emitted radiation from the
[04:33.620 --> 04:37.220]  surface is the sky is colder than the
[04:37.220 --> 04:39.820]  ground surface. At least it typically
[04:39.820 --> 04:41.820]  always is in the summertime
[04:41.820 --> 04:44.140]  especially if the sky is clear. If it's
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.820]  cloudy they can be pretty close and
[04:45.820 --> 04:49.820]  these numbers can be a lot closer.
[04:49.820 --> 04:56.260]  If we were to actually take the
[04:56.260 --> 04:58.300]  measurements that we are making outside
[04:58.300 --> 05:00.460]  I think a lot of us were seeing like
[05:00.540 --> 05:03.020]  negative 20 negative 30 Celsius for the
[05:03.020 --> 05:04.420]  sky temperature that we were measuring
[05:04.420 --> 05:07.540]  with those infrared sensors and we put
[05:07.540 --> 05:09.740]  that temperature in the Stefan-Boltzmann
[05:09.740 --> 05:11.940]  equation. Let me just write that over
[05:11.940 --> 05:14.620]  here on the board. It was in an earlier
[05:14.620 --> 05:23.640]  slide but just to remind everyone.
[05:23.640 --> 05:34.780]  Energy is equal to a constant
[05:34.780 --> 05:38.860]  that we use a sigma times the absolute
[05:38.860 --> 05:41.180]  temperature raised to the fourth power.
[05:41.180 --> 05:44.460]  If we were to take one of our
[05:44.460 --> 05:46.100]  measurements outside, we'll just say the
[05:46.100 --> 05:49.100]  blue sky was negative 30 Celsius and we
[05:49.100 --> 05:51.940]  were to plug it into this equation we
[05:51.940 --> 05:53.740]  would get a number that's a lot lower
[05:53.740 --> 05:58.280]  than 300 watts per meter squared. The
[05:58.280 --> 06:01.460]  reason why is those infrared radiometers
[06:01.460 --> 06:04.020]  we were using outside, they're only
[06:04.060 --> 06:06.620]  measuring the wavelengths between 8 and
[06:06.620 --> 06:09.940]  14 micron. You remember from the infrared
[06:09.940 --> 06:12.420]  presentation that I gave this morning.
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.700]  When we're trying to measure temperature
[06:14.700 --> 06:18.780]  we have to have sensors that have a
[06:18.780 --> 06:21.300]  filter over them that only gives us 8 to
[06:21.300 --> 06:24.420]  14 micron because that's the atmospheric
[06:24.420 --> 06:26.020]  window where the sensor can effectively
[06:26.020 --> 06:28.260]  see through the atmosphere to the
[06:28.260 --> 06:29.740]  surface that we're trying to measure the
[06:29.740 --> 06:32.860]  temperature of. When we're trying to
[06:32.860 --> 06:35.980]  measure net radiation we don't want the
[06:35.980 --> 06:40.220]  8 to 14 micron filter on our
[06:40.220 --> 06:42.880]  long-wave radiation sensors because
[06:42.880 --> 06:45.060]  we're trying to measure all of the
[06:45.060 --> 06:47.700]  radiation coming from either the
[06:47.700 --> 06:50.260]  atmosphere or the land surface. We're not
[06:50.260 --> 06:52.180]  that interested in the temperature in
[06:52.180 --> 06:55.020]  other words and we don't want to see
[06:55.020 --> 06:57.100]  through the atmosphere and
[06:57.100 --> 06:58.620]  measure the cold temperature. We want to
[06:58.620 --> 07:01.100]  actually capture the radiation coming
[07:01.100 --> 07:02.860]  from the air molecules and the clouds
[07:02.860 --> 07:05.260]  and everything that's in the air.
[07:05.260 --> 07:09.460]  Long-wave sensors don't have an 8
[07:09.460 --> 07:12.780]  to 14 micron sensor on them like the
[07:12.780 --> 07:15.620]  infrared temperature sensor does.
[07:15.620 --> 07:18.780]  That's why if we were to plug in negative
[07:18.780 --> 07:21.820]  30 Celsius here we wouldn't get 300
[07:21.820 --> 07:23.220]  watts per meter squared. I can't remember
[07:23.220 --> 07:25.540]  what negative 30 Celsius is when we plug
[07:25.540 --> 07:27.940]  it into the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, but
[07:27.940 --> 07:30.460]  it's a lot closer to like a 150 or 200
[07:30.500 --> 07:34.660]  watts per meter squared. That being said
[07:34.660 --> 07:37.780]  the sky, we're talking about all of the
[07:37.780 --> 07:41.340]  long-wave wavelengths, the sky is still
[07:41.340 --> 07:43.220]  colder than the ground surface and so
[07:43.220 --> 07:46.260]  there's less long-wave coming
[07:46.260 --> 07:47.740]  in from the sky than what's being
[07:47.740 --> 07:49.780]  emitted from the surface. In this
[07:49.780 --> 07:52.280]  example the net long-wave radiation is
[07:52.280 --> 07:56.060]  negative 150 watts per meter squared.
[07:56.060 --> 07:58.340]  Net radiation then is just the sum of
[07:58.380 --> 08:01.860]  these two numbers, net short-wave plus
[08:01.860 --> 08:04.220]  net long-wave gives us net radiation
[08:04.220 --> 08:09.100]  that's 650 watts per meter squared.
[08:09.100 --> 08:13.060]  Essentially that's what our equation
[08:13.060 --> 08:15.860]  here says. The symbol we use for short-
[08:15.860 --> 08:21.780]  wave is short-wave SW and then subscript
[08:21.780 --> 08:25.140]  I for incoming, subscript O for outgoing
[08:25.140 --> 08:27.860]  symbol for long-wave is LW, same
[08:27.860 --> 08:32.980]  subscripts. Any ideas of what these
[08:32.980 --> 08:36.300]  values will look like for the winter
[08:36.300 --> 08:42.020]  over snow? Everybody has the magnet
[08:42.020 --> 08:44.620]  but don't cheat.
[08:45.740 --> 08:51.730]  Say it loud. Exactly right, so you're
[08:51.730 --> 08:53.730]  going to get a lot greater reflectance
[08:53.730 --> 08:55.810]  here because it's snow on the surface
[08:55.810 --> 08:58.930]  instead of vegetation. The albedo of snow
[08:59.010 --> 09:02.890]  is often around 0.7 or 0.8 if the snow
[09:02.890 --> 09:06.090]  is kind of old and dirty or like 0.8 to
[09:06.090 --> 09:08.290]  even 0.9 if the snow is
[09:08.290 --> 09:12.130]  fresh. It's really reflective. How does
[09:12.130 --> 09:13.690]  this one change? We know there's going
[09:13.690 --> 09:15.370]  to be greater reflected radiation but
[09:15.370 --> 09:17.970]  how does this one change in the winter?
[09:17.970 --> 09:21.850]  What's that? Yeah but you're cheating, you've
[09:21.850 --> 09:25.810]  got the magnet. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[09:26.770 --> 09:29.530]  We all know that the seasons change
[09:29.530 --> 09:31.250]  right and the reason the seasons change
[09:31.250 --> 09:32.690]  is because the Sun angles get much
[09:32.690 --> 09:35.490]  lower in the winter versus summer and so
[09:35.490 --> 09:37.450]  this number gets a lot lower just
[09:37.450 --> 09:39.370]  because the Sun is at a much lower angle.
[09:39.370 --> 09:44.690]  It's winter. If this guy is lower
[09:44.690 --> 09:47.930]  we have less overall shortwave coming in
[09:47.930 --> 09:50.410]  but we have a much larger reflected
[09:50.410 --> 09:51.810]  component because we have snow on the
[09:51.810 --> 09:54.490]  surface. What about these two, how do they
[09:54.490 --> 10:00.980]  change in wintertime? Remember these
[10:00.980 --> 10:04.820]  ones are dependent on temperatures.
[10:04.820 --> 10:08.020]  Yeah exactly it's colder in the winter
[10:08.020 --> 10:10.980]  than it is in the summer so the the sky
[10:10.980 --> 10:12.740]  gets a little bit colder and this number
[10:12.740 --> 10:15.740]  gets smaller but not a lot. The surface
[10:15.740 --> 10:18.020]  actually gets a lot colder and so this
[10:18.020 --> 10:20.540]  number gets quite a bit smaller.
[10:20.540 --> 10:24.500]  Now if we look at and everybody has
[10:24.500 --> 10:28.820]  the magnet, reasonable values for the
[10:28.820 --> 10:31.820]  middle of the winter in the middle of
[10:31.820 --> 10:34.380]  the day over a snow-covered surface
[10:34.380 --> 10:37.540]  incoming shortwave is only about 40% of
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.700]  what it is in the summer, 400 watts per
[10:39.700 --> 10:42.580]  meter squared. The reflected component is
[10:42.580 --> 10:46.740]  a lot bigger because the snow has a
[10:46.740 --> 10:50.820]  high albedo. Somebody that can do math in
[10:50.820 --> 10:53.660]  their head what's 350 divided by 400
[10:53.780 --> 10:58.860]  that's about 0.85 roughly I think.
[10:58.860 --> 11:03.540]  0.875 right so the albedo in this
[11:03.540 --> 11:06.460]  example is almost 90% that's a high
[11:06.460 --> 11:10.540]  reflectivity. Then you can see the
[11:10.540 --> 11:13.100]  incoming longwave from the sky does go
[11:13.100 --> 11:15.300]  down a little bit but not as much as the
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.020]  outgoing longwave from the surface.
[11:18.020 --> 11:19.520]  Essentially in the wintertime the sky
[11:19.520 --> 11:20.940]  temperature and the surface temperature
[11:20.940 --> 11:22.780]  are closer to the same value and they're
[11:22.780 --> 11:25.940]  both cold. Our net shortwave here is
[11:25.940 --> 11:29.440]  positive 50, our net longwave there is
[11:29.440 --> 11:32.140]  negative 50 and so the net radiation is
[11:32.140 --> 11:36.260]  actually zero in this example.
[11:36.260 --> 11:39.500]  This is true of the middle of the winter.
[11:39.500 --> 11:47.940]  What about at night what happens?
[11:47.940 --> 11:50.940]  Essentially the the yellow arrows and
[11:50.940 --> 11:54.060]  the yellow numbers go away and we only
[11:54.060 --> 11:57.300]  have longwave at night. If we only
[11:57.300 --> 11:59.900]  have longwave at night that means net
[11:59.900 --> 12:02.300]  radiation is a negative number at night
[12:02.300 --> 12:06.740]  and that's why it cools off a lot at
[12:06.740 --> 12:11.500]  night. The surface is now losing energy
[12:11.500 --> 12:13.820]  to the atmosphere rather than gaining
[12:13.940 --> 12:23.910]  energy as in the day. The reason that
[12:23.910 --> 12:26.310]  we are interested in measuring net
[12:26.310 --> 12:29.590]  radiation is it's a major driver of
[12:29.590 --> 12:32.350]  surface processes. I kind of just
[12:32.350 --> 12:35.390]  explained one heating and cooling but
[12:35.390 --> 12:38.110]  another one is evapotranspiration.
[12:38.110 --> 12:41.750]  In many cases net radiation is the
[12:41.750 --> 12:43.350]  biggest driver or the biggest
[12:43.350 --> 12:45.390]  contributor to evapotranspiration.
[12:45.390 --> 12:47.790]  Vapor pressure deficit, which Bruce
[12:47.790 --> 12:49.350]  talked about a lot this morning, is
[12:49.350 --> 12:51.430]  another one of the major drivers of
[12:51.430 --> 12:53.670]  evapotranspiration. There's
[12:53.670 --> 12:56.430]  lots of reasons that net radiation could
[12:56.430 --> 12:58.990]  be applicable especially in environmental
[12:58.990 --> 13:02.870]  and ecological studies. Here's a
[13:02.870 --> 13:05.830]  slide showing the surface energy balance
[13:05.830 --> 13:09.150]  and here's a simple surface energy
[13:09.150 --> 13:11.430]  balance equation. Net radiation is a
[13:11.430 --> 13:13.910]  major component so we won't consider
[13:13.910 --> 13:16.950]  the the radiation terms in too much
[13:16.950 --> 13:18.430]  detail. They were on the previous slide
[13:18.430 --> 13:20.870]  but you've got incoming shortwave
[13:20.870 --> 13:23.430]  streams and then the outgoing the
[13:23.430 --> 13:26.110]  reflected shortwave streams and long
[13:26.110 --> 13:28.190]  wave radiation coming from clouds and
[13:28.190 --> 13:30.630]  sky. Whatever is in the sky that has a
[13:30.630 --> 13:32.110]  temperature is going to be emitting long
[13:32.110 --> 13:33.990]  wave radiation towards the surface and
[13:33.990 --> 13:36.550]  then plants and soil whatever is at the
[13:36.550 --> 13:38.510]  surface is going to be emitting
[13:38.510 --> 13:42.910]  radiation back towards the sky. The G
[13:42.910 --> 13:45.670]  term is the the soil heat flux, so the
[13:45.670 --> 13:49.310]  flux of energy into the ground. The H
[13:49.310 --> 13:52.590]  term is the sensible heat flux, the heat
[13:52.590 --> 13:55.070]  gain or loss due to conduction and
[13:55.070 --> 13:58.710]  convection. It usually is heat loss
[13:58.710 --> 14:00.910]  during the day because often the surface
[14:00.910 --> 14:03.870]  is warmer than the air but not always.
[14:03.870 --> 14:06.070]  The surface can be colder than the air
[14:06.070 --> 14:07.630]  so there can be a sensible heat flux
[14:07.750 --> 14:10.910]  towards the surface. Then the LE term
[14:10.910 --> 14:13.190]  is the the latent heat loss which is the
[14:13.190 --> 14:15.790]  combination of evaporation and
[14:15.790 --> 14:19.550]  transpiration. There are other terms
[14:19.550 --> 14:21.350]  like photosynthesis would be a small
[14:21.350 --> 14:23.750]  contributor and there can be heat
[14:23.750 --> 14:27.230]  storage in the plants themselves.
[14:27.230 --> 14:29.630]  Typically heat storage doesn't happen in
[14:29.630 --> 14:34.510]  crops but can in forests. We just
[14:34.510 --> 14:36.630]  defined those but here's the real point.
[14:36.630 --> 14:40.150]  The available energy and we call the
[14:40.150 --> 14:42.150]  difference between net radiation and
[14:42.150 --> 14:44.470]  soil heat flux as available energy
[14:44.470 --> 14:46.550]  because that's everything that's
[14:46.550 --> 14:49.790]  available to do things like evaporate
[14:49.790 --> 14:54.430]  water or heat the surface for example.
[14:54.430 --> 14:56.350]  We often find when we make measurements
[14:56.350 --> 14:58.830]  of all of these terms like at
[14:58.830 --> 15:01.070]  eddy covariance sites for example when we can
[15:01.070 --> 15:03.750]  measure sensible heat flux and latent
[15:03.750 --> 15:06.350]  heat flux with gas analyzers and
[15:06.470 --> 15:09.590]  sonic anemometers, we often find that the
[15:09.590 --> 15:12.750]  available energy is not balanced by the
[15:12.750 --> 15:15.630]  heat fluxes at many measurement sites.
[15:15.630 --> 15:20.030]  It should be the energy coming in
[15:20.030 --> 15:25.750]  should equal the energy going out.
[15:25.750 --> 15:27.870]  The real point is net radiation
[15:27.870 --> 15:30.510]  measurements have to be accurate for
[15:30.510 --> 15:33.390]  surface energy balance studies.
[15:33.390 --> 15:36.670]  I'll talk a bit about net
[15:36.670 --> 15:39.590]  radiometers and also talk a little bit
[15:39.590 --> 15:42.270]  about net radiation modeling because
[15:42.270 --> 15:47.430]  earlier we were talking many routine
[15:47.430 --> 15:49.230]  weather stations that we have like
[15:49.230 --> 15:51.790]  weather networks they're going to have a
[15:51.790 --> 15:54.670]  pyranometer on there to measure the
[15:54.670 --> 15:57.830]  incoming shortwave radiation but a lot
[15:57.830 --> 15:59.270]  of times they don't have any other
[15:59.270 --> 16:00.830]  radiometers. When we were talking about
[16:00.910 --> 16:03.390]  photosynthetic radiation earlier they
[16:03.390 --> 16:04.910]  typically don't weather stations
[16:04.910 --> 16:07.790]  typically don't have PAR sensors on them
[16:07.790 --> 16:10.830]  to measure the photosynthetically active
[16:10.830 --> 16:13.590]  radiation and they often don't have a
[16:13.590 --> 16:15.670]  net radiometer on there to measure net
[16:15.670 --> 16:19.310]  radiation. You can model net
[16:19.310 --> 16:22.710]  radiation from incoming shortwave
[16:22.710 --> 16:25.150]  radiation and I'll talk about that in
[16:25.150 --> 16:28.270]  addition to measurements of net
[16:28.270 --> 16:33.310]  radiation with net radiometers. There
[16:33.310 --> 16:36.030]  are four kinds of net radiometers and
[16:36.030 --> 16:38.150]  I'll start with the most complex and
[16:38.150 --> 16:40.670]  then I'll move to the to the simplest.
[16:40.670 --> 16:44.550]  Most of the time you don't see too
[16:44.550 --> 16:46.830]  many of the intermediate types of net
[16:46.830 --> 16:48.950]  radiometers. Usually there's four
[16:48.950 --> 16:50.590]  component instruments which are the most
[16:50.590 --> 16:52.990]  complex and they're quite common or
[16:52.990 --> 16:55.430]  there's single component instruments
[16:55.430 --> 16:57.550]  which are the simplest and they're quite
[16:57.550 --> 17:00.790]  common. A four component net radiometer
[17:00.790 --> 17:05.190]  has an individual sensor for measuring
[17:05.190 --> 17:06.990]  the four components that we just
[17:06.990 --> 17:09.670]  described. You've got an upward looking
[17:09.670 --> 17:11.790]  pyranometer that measures the incoming
[17:11.790 --> 17:15.310]  shortwave, you've got a downward looking
[17:15.310 --> 17:17.270]  pyranometer that measures the reflected
[17:17.270 --> 17:20.830]  shortwave, you've got an upward looking
[17:20.830 --> 17:23.110]  pergeometer that measures the incoming
[17:23.110 --> 17:27.070]  longwave, and you've got a downward
[17:27.070 --> 17:28.910]  looking pergeometer that measures the
[17:28.910 --> 17:32.390]  emitted longwave. Pyranometer is the
[17:32.390 --> 17:34.830]  name of the sensor for shortwave
[17:34.830 --> 17:39.030]  radiation measurements. Pergeometer, kind
[17:39.030 --> 17:41.430]  of a funny word, is the name of the
[17:41.430 --> 17:43.830]  sensor for measuring the longwave
[17:43.830 --> 17:46.830]  radiation. They're very similar
[17:46.830 --> 17:51.750]  instruments. Both of them consist of a
[17:51.750 --> 17:54.470]  thermal pile detector and Bruce talked
[17:54.470 --> 17:57.430]  about thermal piles pyranometers earlier
[17:57.430 --> 18:00.670]  today. Essentially it's a device
[18:00.670 --> 18:04.670]  that measures the heat difference across
[18:04.670 --> 18:09.350]  the top surface
[18:09.350 --> 18:10.990]  and the bottom surface of the
[18:10.990 --> 18:15.710]  plate. Then over top of the
[18:15.710 --> 18:17.630]  thermal pile there's a blackbody
[18:17.630 --> 18:23.070]  absorber. The blackbody is just used
[18:23.190 --> 18:25.790]  to absorb all of the incident radiation
[18:25.790 --> 18:30.590]  on it. Then pyranometers have a glass dome
[18:30.590 --> 18:32.950]  over top of the thermal pile and
[18:32.950 --> 18:36.230]  blackbody detector. The reason for the
[18:36.230 --> 18:39.670]  glass dome is twofold. One is to give it
[18:39.670 --> 18:42.790]  accurate cosine or angular response and
[18:42.790 --> 18:45.430]  the other is to block all of the
[18:45.430 --> 18:48.470]  longwave radiation. For a pyranometer
[18:48.470 --> 18:50.510]  we're only interested in the shortwave
[18:50.550 --> 18:53.510]  wavelengths. The glass is only
[18:53.510 --> 18:56.910]  transmissive to shortwave radiation so
[18:56.910 --> 18:58.910]  we have to put a glass dome over top of
[18:58.910 --> 19:01.830]  the blackbody so that it blocks the
[19:01.830 --> 19:04.070]  longwave, lets the shortwave through.
[19:04.070 --> 19:06.750]  Therefore the blackbody will only absorb
[19:06.750 --> 19:09.030]  the shortwave and the thermal pile will
[19:09.030 --> 19:10.870]  only measure the shortwave
[19:10.870 --> 19:13.510]  radiation. The downward looking
[19:13.510 --> 19:15.230]  pyranometer is the same thing it's just
[19:15.230 --> 19:18.070]  inverted. It's one of them that's mounted
[19:18.070 --> 19:21.190]  upside down. The pergeometer is very
[19:21.190 --> 19:22.990]  similar the only difference is instead
[19:22.990 --> 19:26.270]  of having a glass dome it has a silicon
[19:26.270 --> 19:30.390]  dome over top of the blackbody. I know
[19:30.390 --> 19:32.070]  what I've drawn here doesn't look like a
[19:32.070 --> 19:34.190]  dome shape sometimes the pergeometers
[19:34.190 --> 19:36.150]  will have a small dome shape other times
[19:36.150 --> 19:38.470]  it'll just be a flat surface so it's
[19:38.470 --> 19:40.950]  actually a silicon window rather than a
[19:40.950 --> 19:43.910]  dome. The reason that we use a
[19:43.910 --> 19:47.110]  silicon dome is because it blocks the
[19:47.110 --> 19:49.870]  shortwave radiation and transmits the
[19:49.870 --> 19:52.830]  longwave radiation. A pergeometer is
[19:52.830 --> 19:54.510]  designed to measure longwave we have to
[19:54.510 --> 19:56.310]  block the shortwave and allow only the
[19:56.310 --> 19:58.710]  longwave through so that the blackbody
[19:58.710 --> 20:00.810]  absorber can absorb it and the thermal
[20:00.810 --> 20:03.070]  pile can measure it. Here again
[20:03.070 --> 20:05.710]  you've got one up one down to measure
[20:05.710 --> 20:09.350]  the short and longwave. Some examples of
[20:09.350 --> 20:11.910]  this type of net radiometer are the
[20:11.910 --> 20:15.510]  Huxaflux, that's a Dutch company and
[20:15.510 --> 20:18.390]  Kippezonen, also a Dutch company. They
[20:18.390 --> 20:20.550]  both build four component instruments
[20:20.550 --> 20:22.310]  that work very well and I'll show you
[20:22.310 --> 20:25.070]  some pictures in a minute. Apogee
[20:25.070 --> 20:27.630]  Instruments also builds one. I don't
[20:27.630 --> 20:29.790]  really have a good demo to show you but
[20:29.790 --> 20:32.110]  I will pass this around so you can see
[20:32.110 --> 20:33.710]  what an instrument actually looks like.
[20:33.710 --> 20:38.470]  This sensor here with the white
[20:38.470 --> 20:40.550]  diffuser on the top is the upward
[20:40.550 --> 20:44.350]  looking pyranometer. I know I just said
[20:44.390 --> 20:47.190]  they typically have glass domes, this one
[20:47.190 --> 20:48.790]  doesn't have a glass dome it has an
[20:48.790 --> 20:50.270]  acrylic diffuser which is also
[20:50.270 --> 20:52.110]  transmissive to the shortwave
[20:52.110 --> 20:55.550]  wavelengths. The bottom pyranometer is a
[20:55.550 --> 21:00.230]  glass window, that's this one. The
[21:00.230 --> 21:03.830]  two pergeometers have flat black
[21:03.830 --> 21:08.110]  windows that are made of silicon. They
[21:08.110 --> 21:12.710]  look the same up and down. You're welcome
[21:12.710 --> 21:18.660]  to have a look. Yes?
[21:18.660 --> 21:24.140]  For these ones?
[21:24.140 --> 21:29.540]  The Huxaflux is probably, these
[21:29.540 --> 21:31.780]  numbers are going to be in US dollars so
[21:31.780 --> 21:35.180]  I don't know what they would be in
[21:35.180 --> 21:38.660]  Australian dollars.
[21:38.660 --> 21:40.700]  The equivalent one made in Australia is about
[21:40.700 --> 21:43.340]  six or seven thousand dollars.
[21:43.340 --> 21:46.540]  That's correct, Middleton builds one.
[21:46.540 --> 21:48.300]  I can tell you the designs of these things haven't
[21:48.300 --> 21:50.980]  changed since I did my PhD. You have a
[21:50.980 --> 21:53.060]  plastic thing there and you've got to pass air
[21:53.060 --> 21:55.580]  through it and the whole bit to keep the dome up,
[21:55.580 --> 21:58.220]  keep the condensation out of it. This is
[21:58.220 --> 22:00.660]  the first one, I know this is not a
[22:00.660 --> 22:02.900]  commotion to lift an Apogee workshop
[22:02.900 --> 22:05.340]  but this is the first one since I did my
[22:05.340 --> 22:09.340]  PhD I've ever seen to become a realistic
[22:09.340 --> 22:11.340]  price that will actually work in the field
[22:11.340 --> 22:14.700]  out here having almost 50 sites.
[22:14.700 --> 22:17.220]  What's the price of the Apogee one?
[22:17.220 --> 22:22.140]  That one's, I guess I can say the
[22:22.140 --> 22:23.820]  price, Peter's the one who sells it in
[22:23.820 --> 22:25.900]  Australia, but the US list price is about
[22:25.900 --> 22:29.340]  2500.
[22:29.340 --> 22:36.260]  What's that? You're right, but it will, you
[22:36.260 --> 22:38.740]  also have to pay for importation and all
[22:38.740 --> 22:42.060]  that stuff. This Kippen zoning unit is
[22:42.060 --> 22:45.740]  about six thousand dollars I think maybe
[22:45.740 --> 22:48.140]  a little higher because it comes with a
[22:48.140 --> 22:51.460]  heater and ventilator on it. The Huxa
[22:51.460 --> 22:53.700]  Flux unit is closer to five thousand. I
[22:53.700 --> 22:55.020]  think it's between forty five hundred
[22:55.020 --> 22:57.260]  and five thousand US dollars. That gives
[22:57.260 --> 23:00.540]  you an idea the price tag of these
[23:00.540 --> 23:03.300]  sensors. In a minute I will compare
[23:03.300 --> 23:05.700]  the in a relative sense I'll compare the
[23:05.700 --> 23:08.100]  price of all of the above because we're
[23:08.100 --> 23:10.900]  going to put four more or three more
[23:10.900 --> 23:13.820]  pictures like this one on the slide here.
[23:13.820 --> 23:17.740]  The next type is a net all wave
[23:17.740 --> 23:21.860]  radiometer and this one is the simplest
[23:21.860 --> 23:26.740]  version. You basically have one
[23:26.740 --> 23:29.620]  thermopile and it's sandwiched between
[23:29.620 --> 23:34.860]  two blackbody absorbers, one on top and
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.620]  one on bottom, and there's two
[23:36.620 --> 23:40.180]  polyethylene domes over top of the
[23:40.180 --> 23:44.580]  absorbers. What you have is a
[23:44.580 --> 23:47.700]  thermopile that's just outputting a
[23:47.700 --> 23:49.900]  signal that's proportional to the
[23:49.900 --> 23:51.460]  temperature difference between the top
[23:51.460 --> 23:54.300]  surface and the bottom surface and that
[23:54.300 --> 23:55.780]  temperature difference between the top
[23:55.780 --> 23:57.380]  surface and the bottom surface is
[23:57.380 --> 24:00.260]  dependent on the radiation incident on
[24:00.260 --> 24:02.860]  the top and the radiation incident on
[24:02.860 --> 24:05.740]  the bottom. The reason this is called a
[24:05.740 --> 24:08.780]  net all wave radiometer is that it's
[24:08.780 --> 24:11.260]  measuring each surface, the upward
[24:11.260 --> 24:12.900]  looking surface and the downward looking
[24:12.900 --> 24:15.020]  surface, are measuring all of the
[24:15.020 --> 24:17.260]  wavelengths at the same time. It's
[24:17.260 --> 24:19.900]  sensitive to shortwave and longwave
[24:19.900 --> 24:24.380]  together. Polyethylene actually transmit
[24:24.380 --> 24:27.100]  shortwave and longwave and the reason
[24:27.100 --> 24:30.340]  for the polyethylene domes is just to
[24:30.340 --> 24:33.140]  basically be a weather barrier and keep
[24:33.140 --> 24:36.820]  rain and moisture and dust and dirt off
[24:36.820 --> 24:40.420]  of the blackbody surface. Not all of
[24:40.420 --> 24:42.980]  them have, not all of these net all wave
[24:42.980 --> 24:46.700]  radiometers have polyethylene domes.
[24:46.700 --> 24:51.340]  There's probably the the most common one,
[24:51.340 --> 24:53.980]  at least historically, is this Rebs
[24:54.580 --> 24:57.060]  Rebs stands for radiation and energy
[24:57.060 --> 25:02.260]  balance systems model Q star 7.1. That's
[25:02.260 --> 25:04.860]  an American-made instrument from the
[25:04.860 --> 25:07.740]  state of Washington. They're used a lot
[25:07.740 --> 25:12.180]  especially in past decades. Now it seems
[25:12.180 --> 25:16.100]  like the Kiffin zone and NR light 2 is
[25:16.100 --> 25:18.580]  the most common type of these net all
[25:18.580 --> 25:21.700]  wave radiometers. The Rebs has the
[25:21.700 --> 25:24.460]  polyethylene domes, the Kiffin zone and
[25:24.460 --> 25:31.260]  NR light 2 does not. The real
[25:31.260 --> 25:33.180]  challenge of polyethylene domes is
[25:33.180 --> 25:38.900]  they're flimsy and you have to
[25:38.900 --> 25:41.260]  keep them pressurized often in order for
[25:41.260 --> 25:44.740]  them to not collapse. At the same
[25:44.740 --> 25:49.780]  time polyethylene is better at
[25:49.780 --> 25:52.540]  transmitting shortwave than it is at
[25:52.540 --> 25:55.460]  transmitting longwave. When you get
[25:55.460 --> 25:58.620]  different proportions of longwave and
[25:58.620 --> 26:01.540]  shortwave, say clear sky versus cloudy
[26:01.540 --> 26:04.860]  sky for example, or over vegetation
[26:04.860 --> 26:07.900]  versus over snow, it can really influence
[26:07.900 --> 26:11.820]  the accuracy. The polyethylene domes
[26:11.820 --> 26:14.380]  while they can keep it clean and free of
[26:14.380 --> 26:16.540]  water, they also have their challenges.
[26:16.540 --> 26:19.300]  They have to be replaced quite
[26:19.340 --> 26:21.900]  often because they're flimsy. Birds like
[26:21.900 --> 26:26.500]  to peck holes in them. The Kiffin zone
[26:26.500 --> 26:28.300]  and NR light in doing away with the
[26:28.300 --> 26:30.340]  polyethylene domes they get around at
[26:30.340 --> 26:34.620]  least part of the problem of the
[26:34.620 --> 26:36.700]  domes, but at the same time when the
[26:36.700 --> 26:40.220]  surfaces get wet the radiation balance
[26:40.220 --> 26:43.700]  goes way out of whack and they don't
[26:43.700 --> 26:45.220]  yield accurate measurements until
[26:45.220 --> 26:48.380]  they're dry. These ones while they're
[26:48.460 --> 26:53.340]  the simplest and the cheapest also are
[26:53.340 --> 26:56.940]  the most prone to errors. We just talked
[26:56.940 --> 27:00.340]  about prices for all of these. These guys
[27:00.340 --> 27:05.820]  are probably $1,500 to $2,000 US,
[27:05.820 --> 27:12.140]  somewhere in that range. I won't
[27:12.140 --> 27:14.300]  spend nearly as much time on these two
[27:14.300 --> 27:19.900]  intermediate types just because this
[27:19.900 --> 27:23.020]  this is the only example of this type of
[27:23.020 --> 27:25.020]  two component instrument that I'm aware
[27:25.020 --> 27:28.420]  of and it's no longer available.
[27:28.420 --> 27:31.580]  Essentially you have it works a lot like
[27:31.580 --> 27:34.780]  this one where you have a single
[27:34.780 --> 27:37.420]  thermopile that's measuring the net
[27:37.420 --> 27:39.180]  difference between what's coming in and
[27:39.180 --> 27:41.940]  what's coming out. It's just that we
[27:41.940 --> 27:44.420]  separate shortwave and longwave so we
[27:44.420 --> 27:47.820]  actually have two components. One of
[27:47.820 --> 27:50.180]  them is measuring net shortwave, the
[27:50.180 --> 27:53.540]  other one's measuring net longwave. This
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.140]  was a nice instrument when it was
[27:55.140 --> 27:56.900]  available but it didn't last very long
[27:56.900 --> 28:03.940]  on the market. The other type is also
[28:03.940 --> 28:07.180]  kind of like that one, but rather than
[28:07.180 --> 28:09.700]  being a net device that only gives you
[28:09.700 --> 28:13.300]  one signal that's proportional to the
[28:13.300 --> 28:15.180]  difference between all of the incoming
[28:15.180 --> 28:17.740]  radiation and all of the outgoing
[28:17.740 --> 28:21.540]  radiation, is that they separate the
[28:21.540 --> 28:23.860]  pi radiometers. You've got two of them.
[28:23.860 --> 28:26.540]  You've got an upward looking one that's
[28:26.540 --> 28:28.740]  sensitive to both the incoming shortwave
[28:28.740 --> 28:30.900]  and the incoming longwave and then a
[28:30.900 --> 28:32.980]  downward looking one that's sensitive to
[28:32.980 --> 28:36.220]  both the outgoing shortwave and the
[28:36.260 --> 28:40.460]  outgoing longwave. A good example
[28:40.460 --> 28:45.500]  of this one is the Philip Schenck model
[28:45.500 --> 28:49.500]  8111. It's a European instrument. I
[28:49.500 --> 28:52.180]  believe it comes from Germany, maybe
[28:52.180 --> 28:55.340]  Switzerland. I can't remember for sure.
[28:55.340 --> 28:58.820]  This one is not a very widely
[28:58.820 --> 29:01.060]  used instrument. Predominantly you'll see
[29:01.060 --> 29:08.980]  this or that one. I said I had some
[29:08.980 --> 29:11.540]  pictures, here's what they all look like.
[29:11.540 --> 29:14.060]  The HuxaFlux in the KIPP and then the
[29:14.060 --> 29:16.140]  Apogee that I passed around the room is
[29:16.140 --> 29:20.340]  in the middle. The major advantages
[29:20.340 --> 29:23.340]  of a four component net radiometer is
[29:23.340 --> 29:26.140]  that you get an individual measurement
[29:26.140 --> 29:29.580]  of each one of the four components.
[29:29.580 --> 29:31.660]  That's a major advantage because
[29:31.740 --> 29:34.500]  typically that gives you higher accuracy.
[29:34.500 --> 29:38.780]  I say potentially here because four
[29:38.780 --> 29:41.700]  individual sensors also means you've got
[29:41.700 --> 29:45.220]  four components that might cause
[29:45.220 --> 29:46.940]  problems like if one of them isn't
[29:46.940 --> 29:48.820]  calibrated correctly that can be a
[29:48.820 --> 29:51.420]  problem or you've got four of them that
[29:51.420 --> 29:54.580]  might get dirty for example. Then we
[29:54.580 --> 29:56.220]  already talked about price, these tend to
[29:56.220 --> 29:59.500]  be higher cost. Just one design feature
[29:59.500 --> 30:01.500]  that I will mention with regards to the
[30:01.500 --> 30:05.580]  Apogee is that it has an SDI 12 output.
[30:05.580 --> 30:10.620]  We get around this need for all of
[30:10.620 --> 30:13.540]  those data logger channels. What this
[30:13.540 --> 30:17.580]  means is in the in the center box here
[30:17.580 --> 30:20.620]  on the Apogee unit there's a circuit
[30:20.620 --> 30:22.940]  board in there. All the outputs from the
[30:22.940 --> 30:25.420]  individual radiometers are being
[30:25.420 --> 30:27.660]  measured by the analog to digital
[30:27.660 --> 30:29.820]  converter on that internal circuit board.
[30:29.820 --> 30:32.700]  Then we're just digitizing those
[30:32.700 --> 30:35.060]  signals and outputting an SDI 12
[30:35.060 --> 30:39.060]  measurement so that you can plug it into
[30:39.060 --> 30:41.620]  a digital one single digital channel on
[30:41.620 --> 30:49.560]  your data logger and not have to tie up all of the analog channels.
[30:49.560 --> 30:52.520]  Now if we look at the net all wave
[30:52.520 --> 30:55.120]  radiometers, here's the two examples that
[30:55.120 --> 30:57.680]  I listed in the previous slide. There's
[30:57.680 --> 31:01.080]  the polyethylene domes
[31:01.280 --> 31:05.160]  and that one's the domeless model. So
[31:05.160 --> 31:08.760]  again these domes, they're better at
[31:08.760 --> 31:10.440]  transmitting shortwave than they are
[31:10.440 --> 31:13.400]  longwave which can lead to errors. They
[31:13.400 --> 31:15.440]  don't always stay inflated. If they get a
[31:15.440 --> 31:17.240]  hole in them they'll get water condensing
[31:17.240 --> 31:19.480]  on the inside and cause big problems.
[31:19.480 --> 31:22.280]  Domes seem to be replaced periodically.
[31:22.280 --> 31:24.600]  This one because they're domeless
[31:24.600 --> 31:26.800]  they're exposed to the environment. They
[31:26.800 --> 31:30.880]  can get wet and dirty.
[31:31.280 --> 31:34.000]  The main advantages here are it only
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.520]  requires one data logger channel to make the measurement.
[31:37.520 --> 31:40.720]  Remember there it's a single detector
[31:40.720 --> 31:42.840]  where the signal that is outputting is
[31:42.840 --> 31:44.160]  proportional to the difference between
[31:44.160 --> 31:46.680]  everything that's coming in and everything
[31:46.680 --> 31:49.080]  that's going out. So that only requires one
[31:49.080 --> 31:52.360]  analog measurement. These do tend to be smaller
[31:52.360 --> 31:54.560]  and lighter weight so they can be easier
[31:54.560 --> 31:58.440]  to mount to the level. Again we already
[31:58.440 --> 32:00.000]  talked about price they tend to be lower
[32:00.120 --> 32:05.640]  cost. The major disadvantages, they have
[32:05.640 --> 32:08.360]  fragile domes and they're domeless. This
[32:08.360 --> 32:10.360]  domeless guy requires a wind speed
[32:10.360 --> 32:11.800]  correction because if the winds blowing
[32:11.800 --> 32:13.760]  over top of it it can change the energy
[32:13.760 --> 32:17.720]  balance. If you have mismatched detectors
[32:17.720 --> 32:20.760]  that can be a big problem. Essentially
[32:20.760 --> 32:23.400]  what that means is you only have a
[32:23.400 --> 32:25.560]  single sensor and you've got one
[32:25.560 --> 32:27.520]  detector surface on the top side of that
[32:27.520 --> 32:31.840]  sensor or thermal pile and one detector
[32:31.840 --> 32:33.520]  surface on the bottom side of that
[32:33.520 --> 32:36.200]  thermal pile. They have to have the same
[32:36.200 --> 32:39.720]  sensitivity to shortwave and longwave
[32:39.720 --> 32:41.280]  and they have to have the same sensitivity
[32:41.280 --> 32:45.120]  to each other. Otherwise they're only
[32:45.120 --> 32:47.560]  accurate for the conditions that they're
[32:47.560 --> 32:50.080]  calibrated to. If the conditions are
[32:50.080 --> 32:53.000]  changing like they do in a dynamic
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.800]  environment then the mismatched detectors
[32:57.800 --> 32:59.640]  so the upward sensitivity doesn't match
[32:59.640 --> 33:01.840]  the downward sensitivity can lead to
[33:01.840 --> 33:03.960]  errors. They tend to be higher
[33:03.960 --> 33:05.560]  maintenance for example you have to
[33:05.560 --> 33:07.480]  replace the domes and all of the above
[33:07.480 --> 33:11.760]  combined lead to lower accuracy. This
[33:11.760 --> 33:14.200]  is just a summary slide and I'll mention
[33:14.200 --> 33:18.080]  that a few years ago before Apogee
[33:18.080 --> 33:21.640]  started building net radiometers we
[33:21.640 --> 33:23.720]  were interested in potentially selling
[33:23.720 --> 33:27.360]  net radiometers from other companies and
[33:27.360 --> 33:30.280]  we did an extensive field study where we
[33:30.280 --> 33:33.840]  compared several different models of
[33:33.840 --> 33:38.960]  net radiometers for part of the growing
[33:38.960 --> 33:42.200]  season over a uniform turfgrass field in
[33:42.200 --> 33:46.280]  Logan Utah. The citation to our work
[33:46.280 --> 33:47.680]  is here if you're interested in getting
[33:47.680 --> 33:50.320]  the paper again shoot me an email and I
[33:50.400 --> 33:53.680]  will send you a PDF. The major
[33:53.680 --> 33:56.040]  findings are that the four component net
[33:56.040 --> 33:58.640]  radiometers did indeed provide the most
[33:58.640 --> 34:01.520]  accurate measurements but I put an if in
[34:01.520 --> 34:03.600]  here you have to make sure that the
[34:03.600 --> 34:06.000]  radiometer is level and you want to make
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.920]  sure that the individual sensors are
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.200]  clean. The net all-wave radiometers were
[34:12.200 --> 34:13.880]  the simplest but they did have lower
[34:13.880 --> 34:16.400]  accuracy and it was due to lower
[34:16.480 --> 34:22.120]  sensitivity to long-wave radiation. The
[34:22.120 --> 34:24.480]  last line I think is important we found
[34:24.480 --> 34:26.560]  that net radiometers were capable of
[34:26.560 --> 34:29.040]  measuring net radiation with better
[34:29.040 --> 34:31.160]  accuracy than what's often reported in
[34:31.160 --> 34:32.840]  the literature. There's quite a few
[34:32.840 --> 34:34.880]  studies out there like energy balance
[34:34.880 --> 34:36.840]  studies especially at flux tower sites
[34:36.840 --> 34:39.720]  that indicate net radiation uncertainty
[34:39.720 --> 34:42.720]  is like 10 or 20 percent. I think if
[34:42.720 --> 34:43.920]  you're measuring it with a four
[34:43.920 --> 34:46.320]  component net radiometer that's well
[34:46.320 --> 34:50.360]  leveled and clean and the uncertainty
[34:50.360 --> 34:52.600]  is probably lower than what's usually
[34:52.600 --> 34:54.320]  reported in the literature for net
[34:54.320 --> 34:58.000]  radiation measurements. Any questions
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.320]  about measuring net radiation? I'll
[35:02.320 --> 35:04.120]  just take a minute on I don't have any
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.800]  slides for this but I think I can make
[35:06.800 --> 35:10.000]  use of the the board. I might not even
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.880]  need to make use of the board I think I
[35:11.880 --> 35:14.240]  can just explain it. For those of
[35:14.240 --> 35:16.120]  you that are interested in modeling net
[35:16.160 --> 35:18.040]  radiation again we can talk afterwards
[35:18.040 --> 35:20.640]  or you can send me a follow-up email and
[35:20.640 --> 35:23.200]  I can give you more detail. For those
[35:23.200 --> 35:25.920]  cases when you have weather data
[35:25.920 --> 35:27.720]  and you need net radiation but the
[35:27.720 --> 35:30.400]  weather data did not include a net
[35:30.400 --> 35:32.520]  radiometer to measure the net radiation
[35:32.520 --> 35:36.760]  you can model it. The most important
[35:36.760 --> 35:39.760]  component that you need is a measurement
[35:39.760 --> 35:42.040]  of the incoming shortwave radiation from
[35:42.040 --> 35:44.360]  a pyranometer. If you're looking at your
[35:44.360 --> 35:47.080]  fridge magnet or if you remember my
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.280]  first slide usually the largest
[35:50.280 --> 35:52.480]  component of net radiation is the
[35:52.480 --> 35:54.520]  incoming shortwave component from the
[35:54.520 --> 35:59.160]  Sun. If you have that measurement you
[35:59.160 --> 36:01.640]  have at least a reasonable idea of net
[36:01.640 --> 36:03.800]  radiation and you can model the other
[36:03.800 --> 36:06.680]  components. Typically how it's done is
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.200]  then to take a published value of
[36:11.200 --> 36:13.200]  albedo for the surface that you're
[36:13.240 --> 36:16.720]  measuring. If it's vegetation it's
[36:16.720 --> 36:19.040]  going to be pretty low around 0.2 to
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.120]  maybe 0.25. If it's snow it's going to be
[36:22.120 --> 36:26.680]  quite a bit higher. Published values of
[36:26.680 --> 36:32.720]  albedo are fairly accurate if the
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.240]  surface conditions don't change
[36:34.240 --> 36:35.680]  dramatically. If you're trying to do
[36:35.680 --> 36:38.120]  this when the vegetation is always green
[36:38.120 --> 36:41.360]  just estimating or taking a published
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.720]  value of the albedo and calculating the
[36:43.720 --> 36:46.000]  reflected shortwave component that way
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.800]  works pretty well. The challenge is if
[36:49.800 --> 36:51.280]  you're trying to do this over the course
[36:51.280 --> 36:53.520]  of say a whole year when you might have
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.760]  snow or bare soil in the
[36:57.760 --> 37:01.240]  wintertime and then the crops start to
[37:01.240 --> 37:04.400]  come up and you have green vegetation
[37:04.400 --> 37:07.200]  and soil mixture and then the crops fill
[37:07.200 --> 37:09.200]  in and you only have green vegetation
[37:09.240 --> 37:12.160]  for the most of the growing season and
[37:12.160 --> 37:13.920]  then the crops and nest and they turn
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.200]  yellow and then you harvest them.
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.760]  The surface can be quite dynamic over
[37:20.760 --> 37:23.120]  the course of a whole year so you can
[37:23.120 --> 37:25.400]  only use values of albedo if you know
[37:25.400 --> 37:27.480]  what it is for the surface or have a
[37:27.480 --> 37:29.720]  good estimate of it and if it's not
[37:29.720 --> 37:31.680]  changing significantly. If the
[37:31.680 --> 37:33.120]  surface is changing a lot then you have
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.440]  to change the albedo in your model.
[37:37.440 --> 37:40.800]  The way that longwave is often estimated
[37:40.800 --> 37:44.440]  is from measurements of air temperature
[37:44.440 --> 37:50.760]  and relative humidity and then we can
[37:50.760 --> 37:52.520]  predict longwave pretty well from
[37:52.520 --> 37:56.080]  equations like this. This is the
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.000]  Stefan-Boltzmann equation, emitted energy
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.400]  is proportional to a constant times the
[38:02.400 --> 38:06.160]  fourth power of temperature. If we
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.080]  know reasonably well what the fourth
[38:10.080 --> 38:13.880]  power of temperature is for the surface
[38:13.880 --> 38:17.120]  then we can estimate longwave
[38:17.120 --> 38:19.840]  relatively well the components being
[38:19.840 --> 38:21.880]  emitted because we know that most
[38:21.880 --> 38:25.680]  surfaces are black bodies, most
[38:25.680 --> 38:27.680]  land surfaces are black bodies. If we're
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.080]  working with plant canopies or soil or
[38:32.080 --> 38:38.520]  snow the emissivity right there in the
[38:38.520 --> 38:40.000]  equation this number is going to be
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.760]  close to one so if we have a reasonable
[38:42.760 --> 38:45.480]  estimate of the surface temperature we
[38:45.480 --> 38:47.320]  can estimate the emitted longwave
[38:47.320 --> 38:49.000]  components of the part that's going from
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.280]  the ground to the atmosphere from this
[38:51.280 --> 38:54.360]  equation. To estimate the incoming
[38:54.360 --> 38:57.360]  longwave component we use the exact same
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.480]  equation and oftentimes we use the air
[39:00.480 --> 39:03.520]  temperature as a proxy for the
[39:03.520 --> 39:06.000]  sky temperature. The challenge with doing
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.480]  incoming longwave radiation estimates
[39:09.480 --> 39:12.280]  is this number is the hard one and you
[39:12.280 --> 39:14.920]  were asking about that earlier. There's
[39:14.920 --> 39:18.320]  ways to estimate the emissivity for the
[39:18.320 --> 39:20.720]  atmosphere and that's where the humidity
[39:20.720 --> 39:22.520]  measurement comes in. It's usually
[39:22.520 --> 39:26.760]  empirical equations that estimate
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.080]  atmospheric emissivity based on sometimes
[39:30.160 --> 39:31.840]  air temperature but typically the vapor
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.360]  pressure of the atmosphere. The air
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.240]  can be kind of high because atmospheric
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.560]  emissivity is not always that dependent
[39:43.560 --> 39:46.280]  on the vapor pressure near the surface.
[39:46.280 --> 39:49.240]  The vapor pressure that we measure
[39:49.240 --> 39:51.000]  at the surface typically comes from a
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.720]  relative humidity probe that might be
[39:52.720 --> 39:56.160]  two meters off the ground but the
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.440]  longwave radiation coming from the sky
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.960]  is coming from the whole depth of
[40:00.960 --> 40:03.360]  atmosphere from two meters above the
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.400]  ground till way up in the atmosphere.
[40:06.400 --> 40:09.200]  If the near-surface vapor pressure is
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.560]  reasonable estimate of the whole column
[40:12.560 --> 40:14.840]  of water in the atmosphere then
[40:14.840 --> 40:16.880]  empirically estimating atmospheric
[40:16.880 --> 40:18.840]  emissivity from near-surface vapor
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.840]  pressure works okay. If the near-surface
[40:21.840 --> 40:24.080]  vapor pressure is not a good estimator
[40:24.080 --> 40:25.840]  of the whole column of water in the
[40:25.840 --> 40:29.480]  atmosphere then the empirical equations
[40:29.480 --> 40:32.960]  don't work that well. There are ways to
[40:32.960 --> 40:36.160]  model net radiation if it's not
[40:36.160 --> 40:38.920]  available but I would recommend measuring
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.920]  it if you have the equipment to do so.
[40:42.920 --> 40:45.720]  If you're interested in learning more
[40:45.720 --> 40:49.360]  about how to model net radiation
[40:49.360 --> 40:51.720]  please send me an email I can help with
[40:51.720 --> 40:54.000]  that. There's quite a bit of information
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.480]  in the literature that's been published.
[40:55.600 --> 40:58.400]  There's a really good study from about
[40:58.400 --> 41:05.560]  2007 I think, maybe 2009 where some folks
[41:05.560 --> 41:09.800]  at USDA in the United States compared a
[41:09.800 --> 41:12.000]  whole bunch of different incoming
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.240]  longwave radiation models and assess the
[41:16.240 --> 41:22.160]  accuracy relative to measurements.
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.280]  Any questions? I believe that's all I have for
[41:24.280 --> 41:30.080]  net radiation so...
