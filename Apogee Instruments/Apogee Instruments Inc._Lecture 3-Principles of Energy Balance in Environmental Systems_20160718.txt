[00:00.000 --> 00:09.640]  I welcome everyone back to lecture number three. We're going to talk about
[00:09.640 --> 00:14.480]  long wave today and then hopefully I made an outline here today of the
[00:14.480 --> 00:24.640]  objective for the next 50 minutes or so to get to total net radiation. Before I
[00:24.640 --> 00:34.600]  start, and that's somewhere in here, we get these to go, I made a small
[00:34.600 --> 00:40.120]  error. People say there are no small errors, there's no small
[00:40.120 --> 00:49.120]  typos, there's typos. Yesterday when I did this we have a thousand in and 50%
[00:49.120 --> 00:58.280]  reflected so 50% was absorbed. So this shortwave in was 500, that's correct.
[00:58.280 --> 01:07.280]  This reflection right here is a hundred and I said, well we have a hundred, that
[01:07.280 --> 01:14.080]  means 600 watts are absorbed. But some people correctly said, wait a minute, this
[01:14.080 --> 01:27.280]  hundred is also times 1 minus the albedo. This really is 50 and the
[01:27.280 --> 01:31.280]  correct answer is 500, not 600.
[01:31.280 --> 01:45.600]  This 50 is quite a bit of energy so it's not really a small
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.680]  error, but it's also important that this is correct because sometimes this
[01:51.680 --> 01:57.320]  reflection is huge. If you get something on the south side of a building this
[01:57.360 --> 02:03.120]  reflected energy can be a lot more than 10% in some cases. In this example it's
[02:03.120 --> 02:11.640]  not so big but it depends on the case. We've got this diagram up here with
[02:11.640 --> 02:17.600]  arrows in and arrows out and this is a pretty messy diagram, but it's useful to
[02:17.600 --> 02:25.720]  have diagrams like this because it helps you keep track of the inputs and the
[02:25.720 --> 02:34.920]  outputs. Some years ago we made this diagram and I have this as a handout.
[02:34.920 --> 02:43.800]  The inputs and the outputs. I need to go up just slightly to see the whole works.
[02:43.800 --> 02:50.280]  There it is. All this is a nicer diagram of this. I guess the sun's on
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.920]  the right-hand side now. This arrow we've talked about.
[02:56.920 --> 03:03.120]  This is sky radiation coming in here which we didn't talk about yet.
[03:03.120 --> 03:10.640]  Here's solar in, some bounces off, here's reflected, same thing. These big fat
[03:10.640 --> 03:15.480]  curvy lines what we're going to talk about today, longwave radiation, calculating
[03:15.480 --> 03:20.960]  these. Then of course we get outgoing transpiration, conduction, convection.
[03:20.960 --> 03:28.160]  Here's some longwave components here coming into the leaf. Longwave means the
[03:28.160 --> 03:33.600]  wavelengths are long and so we draw those with curvy lines and shortwave
[03:33.600 --> 03:38.040]  is the wavelengths are short, so we draw those with straight lines.
[03:38.040 --> 03:44.240]  Finally here's soil heat flux when we calculate that. A diagram to keep the
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.280]  components straight and then the goal then in a quantitative sense is put
[03:49.280 --> 03:58.480]  numbers on the arrows and add them up, make sure it balances. This issue of a
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.960]  diagram is something that everybody that teaches this makes some kind of their
[04:04.960 --> 04:10.640]  own diagram of their own. Here is Park Nobel's diagram of exactly the same
[04:10.760 --> 04:17.120]  thing out of this chapter that we're using. Slightly different arrows and
[04:17.120 --> 04:23.480]  in some ways these real fat arrows for infrared radiation kind of
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.840]  overemphasize. If you scale these to the rough size of their numbers the biggest
[04:28.840 --> 04:35.240]  arrow in here would be direct radiation right there coming into the system.
[04:35.240 --> 04:41.720]  That's ultimately what drives the whole thing. These are diagrams to help
[04:41.720 --> 04:49.000]  people see this. Here's the one I love. I read this stuff every time a new
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.560]  textbook comes out. I read the chapter on radiation and I think oh that's a nice
[04:53.560 --> 04:58.120]  diagram and this explains it a little better. I keep thinking of
[04:58.120 --> 05:04.600]  other ways to teach it, but one of my favorites is the textbook that we use on
[05:04.960 --> 05:15.760]  campus, Animal Physiology, the third edition. You turn to chapter 16, Animal
[05:15.760 --> 05:22.040]  Energetics and Temperature Relations. This is not just metabolism because
[05:22.040 --> 05:28.320]  respiration is big in animals, much bigger than people, but so is all the
[05:28.320 --> 05:34.160]  fluxes of long-wave. You turn the page to this author's diagram. I just
[05:34.220 --> 05:40.480]  love this. Hippopotamus with the exact same arrows reflected. He's got a little
[05:40.480 --> 05:47.120]  tiny bit of evaporation, infrared thermal radiation. The point of this is
[05:47.120 --> 05:52.160]  everybody's got their diagram and once you get these principles you start
[05:52.160 --> 05:58.800]  applying them to everything. A hot tool laid out in the Sun and how hot it gets.
[05:58.920 --> 06:04.080]  You can even calculate how fast your laundry will dry on the
[06:04.080 --> 06:13.200]  clothesline depending on the wind speed and solar radiation.
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.000]  I have one more diagram I want to show you before we get there. A couple from the
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.600]  book. I linked this to the book. Here was my picture yesterday of shortwave and all
[06:23.600 --> 06:30.040]  the components and then this big clump of thermal long-wave. Park Nobel has
[06:30.040 --> 06:35.720]  that diagram as well in the book. Only I like my diagram a little better than
[06:35.720 --> 06:43.400]  his because he shows the same thing but he has it on a log scale. I'm not a
[06:43.400 --> 06:50.080]  big fan of log scales for teaching because they distort things. Look
[06:50.080 --> 06:54.320]  at his infrared radiation by the leaf. It looks like this sharp peak and if
[06:54.320 --> 06:59.960]  this was not a log scale it looks like this. It's the same data, direct solar
[06:59.960 --> 07:05.080]  and he has some reflected skylight in here. He also shows wave number.
[07:05.080 --> 07:11.160]  Wave length is simpler but it's still relative fluxes. If you look at it
[07:11.160 --> 07:22.120]  long enough it's the exact same diagram just log scale. He also has this diagram
[07:22.280 --> 07:28.200]  which was on the bottom of one of the handouts for this Stefan-Boltzmann
[07:28.200 --> 07:33.720]  equation. Radiation emitted in watts per meter squared and surface temperature.
[07:33.720 --> 07:38.520]  An important thing about this, this is a nice big diagram, but if you put a pencil
[07:38.520 --> 07:44.400]  on here and you put a ruler on here and you put 25 degrees you're pretty close
[07:44.400 --> 07:51.560]  to 400 watts per meter squared. Which is useful to remember because we're talking
[07:51.560 --> 07:56.800]  about a thousand here but we're talking about fluxes of 400 in long wave so
[07:56.800 --> 08:04.400]  they're not trivial fluxes at room temperature. This would all be terrific
[08:04.400 --> 08:10.720]  if we just calculated temperature, we multiplied it by the Stefan-Boltzmann
[08:10.720 --> 08:16.920]  constant, and we could get our long wave radiation. In the case of long wave
[08:16.920 --> 08:25.480]  radiation not everything is a perfect blackbody. Not everything is perfectly
[08:25.480 --> 08:34.200]  black and radiates a black. Some shiny objects do not emit long wave radiation
[08:34.200 --> 08:42.280]  very well at all. We get an additional symbol in here, it's lowercase e called
[08:42.320 --> 08:53.320]  emissivity. Emissivity is one for a perfect blackbody and the opposite
[08:53.320 --> 09:01.760]  extreme is a piece of tinfoil, the best common thing I can think of that has a
[09:01.760 --> 09:13.120]  low emissivity. Somewhere right here I have a piece of tinfoil to emphasize
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.640]  this point. Here it is.
[09:20.960 --> 09:29.960]  Now we have two things that are confusing. Albedo, which refers to short
[09:30.160 --> 09:36.520]  wave radiation, reflectance of short wave, and then this thing emissivity, which only
[09:36.520 --> 09:43.880]  refers to long wave radiation. Again long wave is warm objects, all objects
[09:43.880 --> 09:50.240]  that are less hot than the Sun. In our environment the only thing that's any
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.440]  significant source of short wave is Sun and then all the terrestrial objects are
[09:55.440 --> 10:07.640]  all back and forth long wave. I'm going to put this up here. I'm going to erase
[10:07.640 --> 10:21.230]  this. This is pretty straightforward. We've got it. Three objects and my
[10:21.230 --> 10:26.230]  goal is that ten years from now you'll still remember this little demonstration
[10:26.310 --> 10:29.310]  and it'll stick in your head and you'll have it forever.
[10:29.310 --> 10:35.310]  Tinfoil, aluminum foil,
[10:35.310 --> 10:38.310]  where's my marker,
[10:41.310 --> 10:53.220]  albedo, pretty reflective of short wave radiation. It depends on
[10:53.220 --> 10:58.100]  how perfect the tinfoil is, if it's got crinkles, but if it's pretty perfect it's
[10:58.100 --> 11:05.620]  going to have an albedo of 0.9. You can look this up in a book to see exactly what
[11:05.620 --> 11:13.820]  people claim for this, but it's high. Now let's do, just doing albedos for a
[11:13.820 --> 11:30.390]  second, black paper. Albedo 0.1. It might even be blacker than that, but 0.1.
[11:30.750 --> 11:35.830]  Now we do white paper and instead of drawing a square I'm putting actual
[11:35.830 --> 11:42.110]  white paper up here. If this was a test question, 100%
[11:42.110 --> 11:52.550]  people would get this right. The albedo of this is about 0.9 plus or minus 0.05
[11:52.550 --> 12:01.110]  or something for these. Now let's do right below this, giving ourselves
[12:01.110 --> 12:13.460]  plenty of room to see it, emissivity. Completely different concept. This is
[12:13.460 --> 12:21.380]  reflected, this is emitted from the surface. As the surface gets warm
[12:21.700 --> 12:30.500]  it's the ability to give off long wave radiation. A black body, this depending
[12:30.500 --> 12:39.500]  on how black it is, this might be 0.9 for the ability to give off. Now white paper,
[12:39.500 --> 12:43.220]  what do you think white paper would be? Well, hardy can emit, right? It's the
[12:43.260 --> 12:57.220]  opposite of black? No. White paper might be 0.85, maybe even 0.9. A white surface
[12:57.220 --> 13:06.100]  is a fine emitter, similar to black. But now let's take a shiny surface, any kind
[13:06.100 --> 13:14.780]  of polished metal that's shiny. The emissivity of aluminum foil, 0.03.
[13:14.780 --> 13:26.540]  That's a clean piece of aluminum foil. Shiny surfaces are poor emitters.
[13:26.540 --> 13:35.700]  What does this mean for energy balance? If this was hot, and again let's imagine
[13:35.700 --> 13:41.500]  we're on the moon where there's no air because it simplifies it. We put this on
[13:41.500 --> 13:47.300]  a stove, we get it hot, we lay it out. It would take forever for this to cool off
[13:47.300 --> 13:53.540]  by emitted radiation. This is a block of metal now, right? We take
[13:53.540 --> 13:57.700]  another block of metal that's black, heat it up exactly the same, lay it out,
[13:57.700 --> 14:02.540]  it cools off right away. Same thing with white, they cool off right away because
[14:02.540 --> 14:10.700]  they can emit that radiation into space, into other objects on the ground.
[14:10.700 --> 14:14.500]  The moon simplifies it because there's no transpiration, conduction, and
[14:14.500 --> 14:23.340]  convection. This little diagram helps to emphasize the differences in
[14:23.500 --> 14:35.460]  emissivity. Now we are going to sacrifice part of this leaf right here to
[14:35.460 --> 14:47.020]  science because the thing we're after is leaves. That plant just gave part of its
[14:47.020 --> 14:57.060]  life for science. Typical albedo of a leaf, and I'll put this one in green,
[14:57.540 --> 15:06.180]  0.25. Not intuitive. It's in between black and white, but has a much
[15:06.180 --> 15:16.020]  lower albedo than white paper would. Emissivity of a leaf, not completely
[15:16.060 --> 15:23.900]  intuitive from this, but the typical value we use for leaf is 0.96.
[15:23.900 --> 15:34.700]  Very, very high. Leaves effectively emit radiation, which also means they
[15:34.700 --> 15:41.060]  can effectively cool off as soon as they get hot. It's worth putting
[15:41.220 --> 15:44.220]  on here one more thing.
[15:44.780 --> 15:55.620]  Let's see, I'm going to erase this, this. Water is blue, right? Now we're going to
[15:55.620 --> 16:09.700]  put a blue square. It's full of water, all blue. Water has an emissivity of
[16:09.860 --> 16:19.220]  about 0.96, maybe even 0.98. This is why biological objects that are
[16:19.220 --> 16:24.700]  full of water, like our skin, have very high emissivity. Things that are
[16:24.700 --> 16:32.420]  hydrated and wet effectively emit long-wave radiation. The albedo of water
[16:32.420 --> 16:37.620]  depends a lot on sun angle. If it's low sun angle, you get glare and a lot of
[16:37.780 --> 16:44.900]  reflectance. It depends on how clear the water is. I'm not going to put a
[16:44.900 --> 16:53.620]  number in here for albedo, but the point is water is a really effective emitter
[16:53.620 --> 17:02.500]  of long-wave. There's the concept of emissivity. One of the things that I
[17:02.500 --> 17:07.140]  think of when I'm thinking about this is, where if we're designing wood stoves to
[17:07.220 --> 17:12.420]  heat the cabin somewhere, we would not want to build the wood stove out of
[17:12.420 --> 17:17.940]  aluminum foil. It'd be terrible. It'd sit there and get hot. If you walked into
[17:17.940 --> 17:21.540]  the room and tried to find that wood stove, you wouldn't tell where it is.
[17:21.540 --> 17:27.900]  Wood stoves are black and they're effective emitters. As soon as a wood
[17:27.900 --> 17:35.900]  stove gets hot, it's given off its heat to the room. You would think there's a
[17:35.900 --> 17:42.980]  lot of things in between here, between these two for emissivities. There are,
[17:42.980 --> 17:49.340]  but not as many as you might think. All polished metals have low emissivity, but
[17:49.340 --> 17:56.420]  most building materials, bricks, white walls, stucco walls, are all up in a
[17:56.420 --> 18:04.220]  higher emissivity. The only things that are really low are shiny objects, but
[18:04.220 --> 18:10.740]  they're a nice example because they're really low. You just told us we
[18:10.740 --> 18:16.140]  can ignore photosynthesis. Why don't we round this off to one significant digit
[18:16.140 --> 18:24.940]  and just call it one. Yes, we would if this was radiation physics 101, but this
[18:24.940 --> 18:32.980]  is radiation physics 501 and this number matters. It's multiplied by hundreds of
[18:33.020 --> 18:38.260]  watts per meter squared. Small changes in this multiplier make a big
[18:38.260 --> 18:48.180]  difference for energy balance and it's worth putting those numbers in.
[18:48.180 --> 18:55.580]  By the way, snow is like this, good emitter of long wave and reflects short wave.
[18:55.580 --> 19:01.460]  I've never actually taught this with the live leaf taped on the board before,
[19:01.460 --> 19:11.700]  but it helps show the concept. Now that we have this, we can start to
[19:11.700 --> 19:18.940]  assemble our energy balance model with all the components of long wave
[19:18.940 --> 19:33.740]  radiation in addition to short wave. We just ran our model and we'll erase
[19:33.740 --> 19:45.980]  some of this and we will say in red radiation shortwave comma absorbed is 550.
[19:45.980 --> 19:57.420]  Now we'd like to do radiation long wave incident. First incident on the
[19:57.420 --> 20:03.220]  leaf. How much is coming in? This line is incident on the leaf. How much long wave
[20:03.220 --> 20:10.740]  is coming in? There's two sources of our long wave, particularly since our leaf is
[20:10.740 --> 20:16.260]  a flat leaf above the ground. A nice simple example. Here's our flat leaf
[20:16.260 --> 20:29.820]  right here and I'm going to even take that part off. We have ground shown in
[20:29.820 --> 20:38.980]  black, long wave coming up to the leaf from the ground. Let's say the ground
[20:38.980 --> 20:43.940]  temperature. I have a handout that assimilates these and I'm going to give you a number. I want to
[20:43.940 --> 20:54.640]  follow the same numbers. We have to assume a ground temperature. Measure it
[20:54.640 --> 21:12.130]  or assume it. In this case I assumed 27 degrees C for the ground. Now we plug
[21:12.130 --> 21:21.210]  that number in and if I'm lucky I can find my chart of long wave chart from
[21:21.210 --> 21:25.800]  yesterday.
[21:25.800 --> 21:32.200]  Where did that go? Anybody have that handy? That's the table of...
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.200]  You can look it up but I want everybody to follow along.
[21:36.200 --> 21:59.360]  Here we go. The ground is 27, 460. 460 for this part right here. 460 T to the fourth Kelvin.
[21:59.360 --> 22:08.800]  We have to measure or assume an emissivity of the ground.
[22:08.800 --> 22:20.440]  We're going to take, I don't have a lot of room but you can see it here, times 0.9 for the
[22:20.440 --> 22:32.280]  emissivity of the ground. That radiation going up is 414. All these units are in
[22:32.280 --> 22:39.760]  watts per meter squared. That leaf is getting 414 from the ground.
[22:39.760 --> 22:51.120]  It's a horizontal leaf so it's also getting radiation from the sky.
[22:51.120 --> 22:55.960]  You would think the sky temperature on a warm day might be 27 degrees C.
[22:55.960 --> 23:02.000]  You would think well about the same as the ground then. If the air
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.120]  molecules are 27 we could do the same thing and it would be 414 here.
[23:07.120 --> 23:15.840]  Correct. The question is how much long wave is from the Sun?
[23:15.840 --> 23:27.560]  The answer is no. If you take a radiometer, good radiometer, and point it
[23:27.560 --> 23:34.240]  right at the Sun you get the same temperature as the open sky.
[23:34.240 --> 23:39.160]  None. It's just amazing. It's so counterintuitive you almost have to
[23:39.160 --> 23:43.000]  walk out with the instrument and say, that's baloney, I don't believe that.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.440]  Point it at the Sun. After class take an instrument and go do that test and
[23:47.440 --> 23:53.720]  convince yourself. It's just amazing. All that Sun is shortwave.
[23:53.720 --> 24:00.080]  A shortwave is one dot in the sky and the whole rest of the sky is emitting.
[24:00.080 --> 24:08.200]  Even though the air molecules might be 27 degrees C, the atmosphere is
[24:08.200 --> 24:15.800]  pretty transparent to long wave. If it was perfectly transparent like say
[24:15.800 --> 24:27.240]  on the moon it would be zero. Outer space is zero Kelvin. It would be zero, but we
[24:27.240 --> 24:33.560]  don't get zero. We make careful measurements of this and we get cold
[24:33.560 --> 24:40.280]  sky temperatures somewhere in between room temperature and zero. We call
[24:40.280 --> 24:48.720]  that the effective sky temperature. It depends somewhat on elevation.
[24:48.720 --> 24:56.560]  It's colder skies at high elevation because there's less air. It depends on
[24:56.560 --> 25:01.480]  relative humidity a bit because the water vapor molecules affect it.
[25:01.480 --> 25:12.680]  Typically from a sky we'll get 300 watts per meter squared. That's a clear
[25:12.680 --> 25:22.600]  sky. Did we use this to get the clear sky? Well, what's the effective emissivity
[25:22.600 --> 25:29.840]  of the air? What's the effective temperature? Both of these interact to
[25:29.840 --> 25:35.240]  give us this number. This is generally a measured number. It doesn't depend on
[25:35.240 --> 25:44.560]  air temperature. It just depends on how clear the sky is. Clouds, let's take a
[25:44.560 --> 25:54.000]  case with clouds. I'm going to get rid of this. Zero. Clear sky, which is what we're
[25:54.000 --> 26:04.750]  doing this model for right now. Clear sky. Now we go over here. Clouds. It
[26:04.750 --> 26:09.350]  doesn't have to be a black thundercloud. It can be a perfectly white nice cloud
[26:09.350 --> 26:13.630]  in the sky. Now we go out with our instruments and point it at the cloud.
[26:13.630 --> 26:23.150]  Clouds are relatively close to the earth. They're full of water vapor. Now we
[26:23.150 --> 26:28.310]  are in fact reading the temperature of the water vapor molecules in the cloud.
[26:28.310 --> 26:39.350]  Pretty often a cloud will jump up to oh maybe 400 watts per meter
[26:39.350 --> 26:45.110]  squared because it's close to the ground and the molecules in the cloud are
[26:45.110 --> 26:52.670]  warm and we no longer see the infinity of space. If it's a real heavy
[26:52.750 --> 26:58.910]  cloud this can get all the way up to over 400 for a cloudy. There's a big
[26:58.910 --> 27:07.590]  difference between cloudy skies and sunny skies for long-wave radiation.
[27:07.590 --> 27:12.470]  Everything else we do from the emissivity of the surface and the
[27:12.470 --> 27:17.710]  temperature, but clouds and sky temperature we just measure them. Now it's
[27:17.710 --> 27:27.510]  been measured many times and so we know approximately what they are.
[27:27.510 --> 27:32.750]  Let's start adding up these numbers now for radiation in. We get 550 absorbed.
[27:32.750 --> 27:50.550]  This is 414 plus 300 would be 714 watts per meter squared radiation.
[27:50.550 --> 28:02.270]  There's one other calculation. 0.96 is the emissivity of a surface, but this is
[28:02.270 --> 28:09.830]  an important thing. I'm going to put it right here. Emissivity equals
[28:09.830 --> 28:12.830]  absorptivity.
[28:13.390 --> 28:27.790]  RP equals 8. This means that if a surface is 0.96 for emitting radiation
[28:28.070 --> 28:37.350]  it's also 0.96 for absorbing that same radiation. If 714 is coming in,
[28:37.350 --> 28:53.150]  let's put this right over here. 714 in, we have to multiply that by 0.96 for the
[28:54.150 --> 29:07.590]  absorptivity of the leaf and that comes out to 685. That number is the energy
[29:07.590 --> 29:18.790]  absorbed by the leaf in long-wave. This is radiation long-wave absorbed in this
[29:18.830 --> 29:33.390]  example. Now we sum that 685 with 550. Here are long-wave absorbed 685.
[29:33.390 --> 29:44.830]  The staggering message is, wow there is more long-wave absorbed by that leaf
[29:44.830 --> 29:50.870]  than short-wave. The sun is hot, you go outside and you think, wow this is it how
[29:50.870 --> 29:57.590]  can this be this is hot. Now what's the sum? 1235.
[30:01.870 --> 30:09.310]  Maybe in radiation 101 you would say, wow they have to evaporate enough water to
[30:09.310 --> 30:17.270]  get rid of this energy. But long-wave works both ways. All this long-wave is
[30:17.270 --> 30:22.590]  coming into this leaf from the ground. But wait a minute, what's the leaf
[30:22.590 --> 30:29.430]  temperature? I assumed a leaf temperature of 25 C.
[30:29.430 --> 30:40.350]  Now how much is leaving that leaf by long-wave and we look up on our chart.
[30:40.350 --> 31:03.150]  25, 448. I'm going to put this over here. Here's a leaf 25, 448 times .96.
[31:03.150 --> 31:17.630]  That's a little less than that. 430. You say, good we can subtract 430 from this
[31:17.630 --> 31:22.230]  and the leaf doesn't have to evaporate so much water but it gets even better
[31:22.230 --> 31:30.990]  than this. Radiation doesn't just go down, radiation can go up too from the leaf.
[31:31.110 --> 31:45.800]  Both up and down. The downside is 430 and the up is also 430.
[31:45.800 --> 31:57.190]  Radiation long-wave emitted is 860 watts per meter squared.
[31:57.190 --> 32:15.620]  We start to do a sum of this and we have
[32:15.620 --> 32:40.440]  radiation absorbed, total radiation absorbed 1235. Radiation emitted 860.
[32:40.440 --> 32:53.320]  This is out so we subtract it. 375 watts per meter squared. That's the final
[32:53.320 --> 33:01.800]  answer. No other add-ons. This is how much water that leaf has to evaporate to
[33:01.800 --> 33:09.440]  stay at air temperature. Big numbers coming in because this is short-wave and
[33:09.440 --> 33:18.360]  long-wave but big numbers going out too. If you think about this, this energy
[33:18.360 --> 33:23.240]  balance right here between the leaf and the ground, if ground and the leaf might
[33:23.240 --> 33:28.240]  be close to the same temperature, so this is always fairly tiny, the net
[33:28.240 --> 33:35.720]  between the ground, but the sky is colder than the ground if it's clear so we can
[33:35.720 --> 33:40.880]  lose energy by long-wave radiation to the sky. That helps on a clear day.
[33:40.880 --> 33:50.560]  It helps keep leaves cool because they're emitting to the clear sky.
[33:50.560 --> 33:57.920]  These are the components and what we calculated was, well we didn't explicitly do net
[33:57.920 --> 34:08.720]  long-wave but we could have. Here is 685 in and 860 out for long-wave.
[34:08.720 --> 34:13.440]  The net long-wave is a negative number and it is always a negative number if the
[34:13.440 --> 34:22.800]  sky is clear. We're losing more long-wave, we're losing heat by long-wave.
[34:22.800 --> 34:33.720]  We worked through this step-by-step using the same inputs as this. Here's a worked out
[34:33.720 --> 34:43.680]  example. Thankfully with your help getting done the math we got the same
[34:43.680 --> 34:48.520]  number as the worked out example. It means either we had corresponding
[34:48.520 --> 34:54.440]  errors or everything's correct. These are the inputs and outputs
[34:54.440 --> 35:02.160]  that you always use to determine radiation balance for any object leaf.
[35:02.160 --> 35:13.330]  These numbers are all big. The stuff coming in and going out is big.
[35:13.330 --> 35:17.250]  You would think maybe we would like to have leaves kind of like tinfoil. Why
[35:17.250 --> 35:19.570]  didn't they evolve like this?
[35:19.570 --> 35:22.850]  Well, once they get hot they can't get rid of the heat.
[35:22.850 --> 35:27.850]  That would not be so good because they're shiny. It's better to have
[35:27.850 --> 35:34.370]  leaves something like this and they're not absorbing the heat in the
[35:34.370 --> 35:40.170]  first place and then they're emitting long-wave to stay cool.
[35:40.170 --> 35:51.770]  I'm thinking about this and teaching it over the years and I'm
[35:51.770 --> 35:56.930]  thinking about how do you give examples to drive home the power of long-wave
[35:56.930 --> 36:05.810]  radiation. I'm going to take these down.
[36:05.810 --> 36:16.930]  There's more room up here. What if, well here's a well-known thing from
[36:16.930 --> 36:23.890]  Boy Scouts, if it's a cold clear night in the mountains go sleep under a tree.
[36:23.890 --> 36:30.450]  You'll be warmer and the Boy Scouts are all kind of you know. If you went out
[36:30.450 --> 36:34.290]  there and did the net radiation the tree is way warmer than sleeping outside
[36:34.290 --> 36:41.330]  under the clear sky because of the radiation. I don't have one with me but
[36:41.330 --> 36:49.410]  if I did it would be a great example. A space blanket. How can they help you?
[36:49.410 --> 36:54.690]  They're thin. They help you doubly because they're shiny on both sides.
[36:54.690 --> 37:04.770]  Your body heat gets reflected back in and this does not emit to the outside.
[37:04.770 --> 37:08.170]  That's why space blankets are so effective. It's nothing to do with
[37:08.170 --> 37:13.850]  conduction and convection. It's all radiation physics. Keeping the warm
[37:13.850 --> 37:19.130]  temperature in. People say, yeah, yeah, you know my grandmother always says put the
[37:19.130 --> 37:24.130]  dull side out and potatoes in the oven. You can read on. People argue about that
[37:24.130 --> 37:29.250]  stuff online. It turns out it just doesn't matter. The dull side is really
[37:29.250 --> 37:36.850]  close to the outside and you know they're both low emissivity sides.
[37:36.850 --> 37:41.530]  If this is the case why do you wrap potatoes in aluminum foil? Because, jeez, I
[37:41.530 --> 37:48.770]  mean the radiation from the oven is not contributing to heating up the potato.
[37:48.770 --> 37:52.890]  To keep the moisture in for the potatoes. This is very effective to keep the
[37:52.890 --> 37:59.130]  moisture in even though it makes the potatoes cook more slowly. That's all
[37:59.130 --> 38:03.730]  radiation physics in the kitchen. We can go on and on about all the cool
[38:03.730 --> 38:07.930]  examples in a kitchen of cooking food and radiation physics. How fast is my
[38:07.930 --> 38:11.730]  food going to cook in an oven? What's the walls of the temperature of the oven?
[38:11.730 --> 38:18.130]  There's no shortwave in an oven. It's all radiation physics and it's helped now
[38:18.130 --> 38:24.770]  with convection ovens. We turn a fan on so we get some convection in there.
[38:24.770 --> 38:31.050]  Here's the example that drives home the power of longwave radiation. I'll
[38:31.050 --> 38:35.690]  draw a diagram of this and then you can tell me what you think is going to
[38:35.690 --> 38:47.530]  happen. We're going to build a box or a cylinder and we'll make it out of
[38:47.530 --> 38:56.050]  blue styrofoam. Something that's a very effective insulator.
[38:56.050 --> 39:06.610]  In the bottom of this we're going to put a bowl with water in it.
[39:06.610 --> 39:15.770]  A thin layer of water. By the way the bowl is painted flat black. The surface of the
[39:15.770 --> 39:23.810]  bowl is painted flat black with water in it. Now we take this outside. It's a simple
[39:23.810 --> 39:33.130]  device. Take this outside like tonight. It's hot but the temperature
[39:33.130 --> 39:38.930]  might get down to 20-25 C tonight. We take it outside under a clear sky and
[39:38.930 --> 39:50.500]  it's calm winds. What's going to happen to the temperature of that water? The room
[39:50.580 --> 40:00.420]  temperature when brought it outside it's going to radiate to the infinity of
[40:00.420 --> 40:07.500]  space. The whole inside of this is going to radiate to the infinity of
[40:07.500 --> 40:15.780]  space and it'll get colder and colder. Conduction and convection can't
[40:15.780 --> 40:24.420]  warm it back up because we have a big insulated cylinder. If it's windy we
[40:24.420 --> 40:31.740]  could put a piece of cellophane on there. Real thin cellophane transmits longwave.
[40:31.740 --> 40:40.740]  It works good even without this. Now it gets colder and colder and
[40:40.820 --> 40:50.580]  it's radiations coming in from the sky. It's a clear night and the sky
[40:50.580 --> 40:59.220]  temperature, I put 300 as an average but around here and I've got some examples
[40:59.220 --> 41:09.500]  of this, this sky temperature can be more like, I don't know if I've seen 200 but
[41:09.500 --> 41:16.100]  250 watts per meter squared. Mark, do you remember low numbers from sky?
[41:16.100 --> 41:29.420]  Let's say 250 for summer. Now radiation, we have to follow the
[41:29.420 --> 41:35.580]  first law of thermodynamics. Energy in equals energy out. This keeps
[41:35.580 --> 41:44.900]  going until these two arrows are exactly the same size. If 250 is coming
[41:44.900 --> 41:54.580]  in, 250 has to be going out. What's the temperature of the water on a hot summer
[41:54.580 --> 42:07.780]  night in Logan if 250 is the emitted radiation? Back to our table.
[42:07.780 --> 42:21.990]  The water freezes. It easily freezes and this is so counterintuitive. It would
[42:21.990 --> 42:28.390]  freeze even if the sky was 300. It would get below zero and the water would freeze.
[42:28.390 --> 42:38.790]  That is the power of longwave radiation. This is so cool. After I thought of
[42:38.790 --> 42:47.990]  this, I had to go do it. This is my house, my backyard patio. We can zoom in on
[42:47.990 --> 42:56.750]  this so we can get this really big in here. I got some blue styrofoam. I did it
[42:56.750 --> 43:01.390]  once and it didn't get super cold and I kept doing it. I got bigger layers and
[43:01.390 --> 43:05.990]  I made this longer. You can see a fine net radiometer right up here so I can
[43:05.990 --> 43:11.150]  see how this is coming along. You can tell this is a long time ago because
[43:11.150 --> 43:16.070]  this is like an old 8088 computer and this is my daughter who is now 26 years
[43:16.070 --> 43:23.310]  old. A little pump to inflate the domes and that thing. Right in here is a
[43:23.310 --> 43:27.350]  Campbell scientific datalogger with thermocouples in the water and
[43:27.350 --> 43:31.630]  thermocouples all over. I'm watching a very primitive graph of the
[43:31.630 --> 43:36.750]  temperature in this thing and my wife came out and took a picture. It wasn't
[43:36.750 --> 43:41.270]  dark yet. The sun was just setting. I never got that water to
[43:41.270 --> 43:47.390]  freeze but I got it to like 1 degree C. It was pretty cold. That's
[43:47.390 --> 43:51.910]  radiation physics. In fact, this is such a powerful principle. The reason I
[43:51.910 --> 43:56.630]  thought of it is because people make refrigerators in the tropics just like
[43:56.630 --> 44:01.430]  this and they open them at night and they have blocks of water in here.
[44:01.430 --> 44:04.870]  They get cool at night and then they close them in the
[44:04.870 --> 44:12.950]  day. You can keep food cold just by radiation cooling. In fact, you could run
[44:12.950 --> 44:17.230]  this in the day if you kept pointing it away from the sunlight because the sky
[44:17.230 --> 44:32.510]  is clear in the night and the day. I have a couple of other examples of this.
[44:32.510 --> 44:39.150]  Since this particular audience is instrument intensive, now we'll show some
[44:39.150 --> 44:49.470]  actual data. I gave this as a test
[44:49.470 --> 44:55.270]  question to students after I talked about these principles. This is last
[44:55.270 --> 45:00.230]  winter January 11th. It's one week to January 17th.
[45:00.710 --> 45:07.470]  On campus, net radiation, and first of all it's measured albedo because we have
[45:07.470 --> 45:13.950]  radiation in and radiation out. What you need to know here is on these days the snow
[45:13.950 --> 45:19.510]  had melted off and it was basically grass. Mostly dead grass is January but
[45:19.510 --> 45:24.830]  it wasn't snow. What did we say the albedo of grass was? Maybe 0.25.
[45:24.830 --> 45:31.790]  Hard to see on this scale but there's about 0.25 for these days here.
[45:31.790 --> 45:35.430]  These are night by the way in here.
[45:35.430 --> 45:43.310]  It's just zero, zero in, zero out. Then we had this big spike that went to two.
[45:43.310 --> 45:50.350]  If you weren't an instrumentation person you're going to go, wow! Two times as
[45:50.350 --> 45:58.630]  much shortwave radiation leaving as coming in. What could have caused that?
[45:58.630 --> 46:09.070]  This giant spike right here. If you're living in the area you would
[46:09.070 --> 46:18.070]  remember what the weather was like. Here is why that thing spiked up.
[46:18.070 --> 46:24.750]  This is Peter Sinks, not the same time. There's a bunch of snow. This is a
[46:24.750 --> 46:29.750]  Huxaflux net radiometer. Shortwave in, longwave out. Guess what? The shortwave in
[46:29.750 --> 46:34.830]  is blocked so of course it goes to two because the bottom one is not blocked.
[46:34.830 --> 46:41.270]  We get issues like this and you just have to understand the things that
[46:41.270 --> 46:45.830]  give you bad data and filter them out of the data set.
[46:45.830 --> 46:50.110]  If I was a little more organized I'd show you the exact picture of the campus
[46:50.110 --> 46:53.390]  station at the same time because it happens every time it snows. You get
[46:53.390 --> 46:58.750]  stuff in here. For that reason we put heaters in sensors whenever we can.
[46:58.750 --> 47:03.710]  Heaters are expensive so it's hard to run them off a solar power and then when
[47:03.710 --> 47:08.990]  it snows you get snow in your solar panel and stuff. Here is one
[47:08.990 --> 47:15.350]  little silicon pyranometer with the heater that kept reading correctly
[47:15.430 --> 47:22.270]  during that snowstorm. If we would have had two of these in that system we
[47:22.270 --> 47:30.910]  would not have had this artifact right here, this albedo of two.
[47:30.910 --> 47:35.510]  Here the snow melted and it's a little not completely melted. Now look at the
[47:35.510 --> 47:44.710]  albedo of this surface. No snow, snows, 0.8. The snow we did what it
[47:44.790 --> 47:49.670]  should. It reflected shortwave radiation. Then we got some, I think we got
[47:49.670 --> 47:54.750]  more snow, but it jumped from this. A nice example of no snow and
[47:54.750 --> 48:05.110]  snow on the ground. Here's some numbers for incoming longwave. Mark said
[48:05.110 --> 48:08.110]  we can get down to 200 in the winter. Well there we go.
[48:08.110 --> 48:14.310]  That was a very clear sky. The longwave was 200 watts per meter squared.
[48:14.430 --> 48:22.110]  Here's a cloudy sky and we're up around 320. Whenever it gets
[48:22.110 --> 48:28.550]  clear the sky gets cold. Outgoing longwave is just based on the temperature
[48:28.550 --> 48:32.710]  of the ground and that's this purple line. You can tell the temperature of
[48:32.710 --> 48:38.830]  the ground because the outgoing longwave was 280 to 300 which is right just
[48:38.830 --> 48:44.430]  slightly below zero. The surface of the snow up there was was probably minus
[48:44.430 --> 48:54.030]  three degrees. These graphs are on the internet and I'm going to put the
[48:54.030 --> 49:01.270]  location right here because as soon as you know the principles you can watch
[49:01.270 --> 49:08.270]  these graphs and say yeah that's why this is working. They're at weather.usu.edu.
[49:08.270 --> 49:19.670]  This is a whole series of graphs of all these principles. There's many
[49:19.670 --> 49:25.550]  more but this is one of them. I use these all the time as test questions.
[49:25.550 --> 49:28.790]  They say here was the weather last week. Here's what was going on. Explain this
[49:28.790 --> 49:33.230]  graph. Why did this go up? Why did this go down? You get to look at ratios of
[49:33.230 --> 49:37.550]  different graphs to see what's going on. It's really helpful to drive
[49:37.550 --> 49:54.940]  all this radiation physics into your head to see examples of it.
[49:54.940 --> 50:03.500]  This is the same time period. It's a different graph but ground temperature,
[50:03.660 --> 50:09.740]  equivalent sky temperature. That's what we call it. This sky temperature up here
[50:09.740 --> 50:18.020]  is the equivalent of minus 22 C. It's the combination of effective emissivity
[50:18.020 --> 50:22.700]  and sky temperature. We call that equivalent sky temperature. Then net
[50:22.700 --> 50:27.700]  is just the difference. Of course whenever the net is a really low number
[50:27.700 --> 50:37.060]  that means it's a clear sky. Look at this. Zero cloudy skies. Lots of clouds
[50:37.060 --> 50:42.780]  in this period. The net radiation was zero. The clouds were just as warm as the
[50:42.780 --> 50:48.260]  cold surface in the heavy clouds.
[50:48.260 --> 51:05.250]  I don't have a handout of this but I'm always looking for teaching
[51:05.250 --> 51:15.290]  examples. Here is a picture.
[51:15.290 --> 51:22.850]  There's a picture of a stone. It's a little bit
[51:22.850 --> 51:27.490]  glaring but this is all snow. This is in the middle of winter.
[51:27.490 --> 51:33.570]  I'd like to tell you this was up Logan Canyon but it wasn't. A dark rock and
[51:33.570 --> 51:38.810]  look at the melting of the snow. Here's the shadow of the rock. It's a bright day.
[51:38.810 --> 51:45.450]  Here's the melting of the snow right around the rock. What made that snow
[51:45.450 --> 51:55.840]  melt? Reflected shortwave. Wait a minute. The rock is really dark. There's hardly
[51:55.840 --> 52:03.720]  any reflected shortwave. Every day that rock absorbed the shortwave like crazy
[52:03.720 --> 52:12.000]  and got warm above the air temperature. All night long is emitting longwave
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.480]  radiation and melting the snow. This is longwave radiation melting the snow
[52:17.480 --> 52:25.520]  from a warm rock not reflected shortwave radiation. That's what then I put that
[52:25.520 --> 52:31.320]  down here. Longwave radiation emitted from a stone. You can see it's not
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.920]  super warm. It's probably melting this a few millimeters every day until it
[52:35.920 --> 52:42.680]  snows again. It's warm enough to melt the snow by the longwave.
[52:42.680 --> 52:53.120]  Net radiation is such a big factor in everything with energy balance.
[52:53.120 --> 53:03.720]  By the way, now we have simplified all this stuff. It feeds into one thing.
[53:03.720 --> 53:06.720]  We'll put it up here.
[53:08.520 --> 53:19.920]  Now our whole equation goes to our net and this is absorbed equals T plus C
[53:19.920 --> 53:28.000]  squared. All those components that feed into this give us one number. To
[53:28.000 --> 53:38.040]  put numbers on this, 375 equals T plus the sum of T plus C squared.
[53:38.040 --> 53:43.160]  This is a tough number to get at because of all the factors we talked about.
[53:43.160 --> 53:49.440]  Once we get it, wow, there's only two components that can go into this.
[53:49.440 --> 53:59.840]  This is the theory, but not surprisingly companies have built instruments to
[53:59.840 --> 54:09.640]  measure this number to make this easy. To help people understand those
[54:09.640 --> 54:16.280]  instruments we made another refrigerator magnet. You can put it on your
[54:16.400 --> 54:24.400]  filing cabinet and look at it. Every time things seem a little goofy.
[54:24.400 --> 54:35.720]  This has got two sides. I can zoom in a hair. Two sides, summer and winter.
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.160]  It's great because these fluxes are so different. It's got shortwave and
[54:40.160 --> 54:43.240]  longwave. All these principles we've been talking about for two days are all right
[54:43.240 --> 54:52.120]  here. 1000 in, now 200 out. The albedo is 0.2 in this example. Nice round number.
[54:52.120 --> 55:01.480]  The net for this is 800 because sums reflected. Here's longwave, 450.
[55:01.480 --> 55:08.600]  This is roughly, what would 450 be? 24 C or something right around there. Sky, 300.
[55:08.600 --> 55:20.080]  Net, minus 150. Net and net, 650 watts per meter squared for a fully vegetated
[55:20.080 --> 55:29.880]  surface. In this case, this is not a single leaf. We do not have transmitted
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.840]  radiation to the ground because it's fully, all those leaf layers are all
[55:34.840 --> 55:42.080]  absorbing it. We also don't have two sides to radiation. Here it was
[55:42.080 --> 55:48.000]  radiating down, but here the ground and the leaves are the same. We got to get
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.360]  rid of 450 watts per meter squared in the summer. Winter, much lower input. You
[55:55.360 --> 56:02.640]  can see the Sun, anatomically correct Sun, sank in the sky a little bit. 400 in,
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.800]  snow, 350 out. Now the net is only 50 in the winter. No wonder it's cold in the winter.
[56:08.800 --> 56:15.160]  Longwave, the snow is cold so only 300. A little bit less longwave from the sky.
[56:15.160 --> 56:28.160]  Net plus 50, net minus 50, zero. It's not warming up on days like this in the
[56:28.160 --> 56:34.920]  winter, largely because of the snow cover. Then we finally get some warm air
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.560]  to help melt the snow and then the whole warming starts. This little
[56:39.560 --> 56:44.320]  refrigerator magnet helps it understand the magnitudes of the fluxes in two
[56:44.320 --> 56:47.320]  very different conditions. It's been helpful.
[56:47.320 --> 57:02.230]  I'm going to stop here and pick this up tomorrow. I think at this point
[57:02.230 --> 57:07.990]  the next thing I want to do is apply this to the whole planet Earth for
[57:07.990 --> 57:18.470]  energy balance on the earth. We're an independent system orbiting
[57:18.590 --> 57:23.270]  through the vacuum of space. We are not losing heat by conduction and convection.
[57:23.270 --> 57:28.470]  The earth isn't. We're not losing or gaining heat by transpiration. The water
[57:28.470 --> 57:35.430]  we have stays in the earth. All we have is radiation physics to the rest of the
[57:35.430 --> 57:45.390]  rest of the universe. If that doesn't balance, if this whole thing, if
[57:45.390 --> 57:53.030]  net radiation isn't 0.00 for the earth, we're either going to cool off or warm up.
[57:53.030 --> 57:57.670]  Now that you have these principles in place, now we can take a look at the
[57:57.670 --> 58:01.950]  fluxes for the whole earth. This in a nutshell is the essence of global
[58:01.950 --> 58:08.990]  warming. I think I can explain to you why that's complex. Why the smartest
[58:08.990 --> 58:13.910]  people in the world are doing global warming right now to try and see is this
[58:13.910 --> 58:20.150]  number really zero? How far off of zero is it? That's all radiation
[58:20.150 --> 58:24.670]  physics. I'll stop here.
[58:24.670 --> 58:49.820]  Dirk? That's not noise. That's a subject of many PhD theses. It is.
[58:49.820 --> 58:54.580]  You got to start with one thing that we understand really well and then you say
[58:54.580 --> 59:01.140]  okay here's that leaf. Now we're going to tilt it. Now what happens? The
[59:01.140 --> 59:06.140]  first thing that happens is multiple tilted leaves don't reflect quite as
[59:06.140 --> 59:11.820]  much. As we just said here, the transmission to the ground is much
[59:11.820 --> 59:18.540]  less. It doesn't affect it as much as you might think because you
[59:18.540 --> 59:25.060]  still have reflected shortwave and the longwave is just from the surfaces. It
[59:25.060 --> 59:28.340]  doesn't matter that they're all vertical surfaces and it's going like
[59:28.340 --> 59:37.980]  this. Eventually it goes up. One flat leaf has the same effective radiation as
[59:37.980 --> 59:43.300]  a hundred vertical leaves as long as they're covering the ground. That
[59:43.300 --> 59:48.940]  orientation doesn't matter for the emission of longwave. Same thing for
[59:48.940 --> 59:54.700]  absorption. It comes in. The biggest thing with tilting leaves is reflection is a
[59:54.700 --> 01:00:01.300]  shortwave where it bounces and captures it better. Any rough
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.020]  surface would absorb better than a smooth polished surface. In fact, that's
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:12.540]  part of the reason that polished metal is such a low emissivity. When
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:18.460]  polished metal oxidizes, like copper, it goes green. All of a sudden polished
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.740]  copper is 0.03, it oxidizes and goes green and now it's 0.9 because that
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:29.900]  surface is rough. It's a similar thing to leaves that the structure of
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.900]  the surface affects the reflection of shortwave.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:49.540]  With vertical leaves?
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:01:04.380]  Let me add to this answer. We said a thousand watts per meter
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:09.140]  squared for this. I actually never thought of this before. That only happens
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:14.580]  if the leaf is perpendicular to the Sun. The Sun is only perpendicular to the
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.780]  ground at the equator at the right time of the year. I probably should do this
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:25.580]  example with a flat leaf and an angle because it wouldn't be a thousand. It'd
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:31.420]  be flat and if it was really close to the Sun it'd be a lot less. Yes, that
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:44.140]  angle definitely matters being perpendicular to the light source.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:51.820]  This brings us to an
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:02:01.700]  instrumentation tidbit that is not well understood by people. Let me go right
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:14.140]  here. When we build or use instruments, here's an instrument and here's up some
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:20.540]  white disc up here. I mean there are various shapes of curved domes but we say these
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.820]  are cosine corrected. Everybody says, okay cosine corrected, that's good. What does
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:34.980]  that mean? It means that if you put a reference light here you would get, let's
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:40.700]  say we did this and we got a thousand watts per meter squared. Now we took that
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:47.340]  same light and we put it at some low angle. If this sensor still reads a
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:55.220]  thousand, it's not cosine corrected. It has to read less by the cosine of this
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:01.940]  angle. So at a low angle the correct number might be say a hundred, the
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:09.180]  correct number. Now if it reads 200 it's not cosine corrected. If it reads 50 it's
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:18.980]  also not cosine corrected. It has to be the right ratio of tilted radiation.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:26.820]  If we make a graph of this, there's one of these graphs on the Apogee website.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:41.640]  I have to think this goes like this and I think this graph is, let me see, nope.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.000]  This is radiation here and this is angle.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:57.560]  So right here is 90 degrees and that sensor should read zero because
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:04.040]  everything's missing it. Here's zero degrees and this might be a
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:09.200]  hundred or a thousand depending on the units. This is a theoretically perfect
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:16.720]  cosine response that says at each lower angle the reading of the instrument
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:25.040]  should read somewhat less. I used to think many years ago that all the
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.800]  instruments went like that and they were wrong because they didn't capture the
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.160]  low angle right. Now I know it's just as easy to make a sensor that goes like
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:40.400]  that. You can get too much low angle light. You can underdo it or overdo it
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:48.240]  and any instrument has to have the right optics to follow this line as closely as
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.000]  possible. The theoretically perfect cosine. Not too low, not too high. We
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.640]  calibrate our instruments right here and then we hope all those angles are
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.720]  correct. Once you get it right for an instrument it's reproducible.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:18.400]  In the summer most of the sunlight is in this range here. It's in high
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:24.920]  angles and it's not too hard to get an instrument to follow this at these
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:31.480]  angles. It gets really hard to get the instrument to keep following it right to
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.800]  zero and in fact none of our instruments get this perfect. The
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.840]  highest end Kipp and Zonen instruments aren't perfect, none of them are, but they
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:48.880]  get close. They start to deviate right down here from perfect. This
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:53.400]  isn't too critical because this is low angle light. You might
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:58.960]  be off by five percent but it's five percent of a small number. Over here
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.840]  you better be right on because it's a big number. This is cosine
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:09.560]  correction and I think this speaks to your example of angles in here and what
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:16.200]  happens when you tilt things. How does it change it? Our
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:22.160]  instruments measure, it's by definition, what would the radiation be on a flat
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.720]  surface. If you want to calculate the radiation on a tilted surface you can.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.680]  A little trigonometry and like Mark just pointed out, if you tilt it it goes
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:41.520]  above a thousand. That's one way to explain the effect of
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.360]  tilted surfaces. This is for an instrument but you can also use this for
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.120]  any surface. What would it be tilted toward the Sun? If you made your
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:07:00.400]  measurement flat you could predict the increase in radiation from tilting it.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:23.320]  It's a good question. Yes, yes, there yes really good question and the answer is
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:30.720]  yes. Now let me answer that question. I got to race and give myself a tiny bit
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:43.640]  more room. A leaf in particular. Here's our leaf. Now we're going to bring in a
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:08:03.000]  way giant microscope and leaves are half air. This is some beginning
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.040]  plant physiology and then you get stomates in here like this. Every plant
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:15.080]  biology book has a diagram like this. There's full of air and these aren't
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:19.080]  as probably as quite as dense as I drew them. They're not touching.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:25.360]  Now we have light coming right through and it bounces around and it bounces out.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.320]  Now we have light coming at an angle and it bounces a lot more and the
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.280]  transmission of light coming at an angle is way less. The reflection is more
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:43.120]  because it's a low angle but the transmission is less. We study
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:49.360]  penetration of light into leaves at different angles and the lower the
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.400]  light the less the transmission. One part of this goes down and another part
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:09:00.920]  goes up, which is partly why we get away with saying 0.5 because
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:08.800]  there's some offsetting changes in this. In general the transmission at low
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:15.280]  angles goes down faster than this goes up. In fact when we get to whole
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:21.160]  canopies you can imagine how much math you can do to try and analyze this with
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.400]  all the angles and people have worked on that. Another way is just to put a
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.440]  net radiometer out there and just measure it. The sum of all these is
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.600]  this. There's a theoretical treatment and then there's the
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.960]  measurements. If your instrument's good you're going to nail these these
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:48.720]  fluxes on this. This is a great example of why net radiation is so valuable.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:55.320]  Net radiometers are more expensive instruments so few people use them.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.640]  When they don't use them they're trying to model these fluxes, all of them.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:06.440]  You can measure this big one and then you try to model the rest. Some
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.800]  years ago Rick Allen, he was here at the University for many years.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.440]  Now he's at Kimberly, Idaho. He wrote part of a book chapter and after
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.080]  testing at the time a bunch of instruments for net radiation he said
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:29.000]  these instruments have sufficient problems that it's more accurate to
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.760]  model the net radiation fluxes than it is to measure them. That's a sentence in
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:41.360]  that chapter in a book I think. It's FAO 56. Since then Blomquist et al. did a
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:47.120]  big study with a bunch of net radiometers and as I recall nearly all
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.920]  of the net radiometers were more accurate than the models. The only ones
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.080]  that weren't were the very cheapest models. All, even the cheapest
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.720]  net radiometers. That's the evolution of instruments. They're
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.680]  better and cheaper. You can see if you can get this number right with
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.320]  an instrument, wow you're really getting there because now you just got a
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:20.040]  couple other components. In my experience if a user just puts the
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:25.680]  instrument out there without any understanding of all this stuff they
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.400]  have no idea when they're collecting bad data. If you understand the
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  stuff you can look at the lines and say this can't be right right here and we
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.520]  better go check the instrument. That's worth a lot to have that
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.520]  background.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:56.880]  Devin. You would think they would have a huge effect on this. If you
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.400]  asked the true false population, you know, everyone said duh, they have a
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:08.000]  huge effect on it. If you go out with our radiometers and measure this, there's
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.360]  hazy right? This is going to be less. Wait a minute, those inversions are one,
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.400]  two, three hundred meters thick. When you look sideways at the mountains you can
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.520]  see the haze. Now go out and inversion and look up and tell me if you can see
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.240]  the haze. It's not deep enough. The sky looks fine. You have to be
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:35.040]  looking through an air mass of several, two or three or four to see the haze.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.840]  This incoming shortwave is actually hard to measure. I mean hard to
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:46.400]  tell that there's an inversion based on attenuation of shortwave. We could if we
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:52.160]  had one 400 or 500 meters up and one at the ground we could we could see it, but
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.720]  it's hard to see. This tells you why we get cold inversions, snow on
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.640]  the ground and we can't heat the ground up because there's snow on the ground.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:17.560]  Some because there's crap in the air. Here's an example. We keep
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:24.280]  studying the website PM 2.5 and we say wow this is a terrible day. It's up to 50.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:33.800]  What are the units on that? Well micrograms per cubic meter. Wow, a
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.840]  microgram. I mean a paperclip is a gram and so this is a millionth of a paper
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:48.600]  clip per meter. The weight of the particles is tiny and even though
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.160]  they're bad for our lungs, there's no doubt about that, the optical effects are
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:59.400]  smaller than you might think. These fluxes don't change much from those.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:06.160]  They change more with humidity. Humidity can be 3-4 percent of the... well in the
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.800]  winter it might be one or two percent, but humidity is many orders of magnitude
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:17.200]  greater than the PM 2.5 and small changes in humidity would have a bigger
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.200]  effect than big changes in the particulate matter.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.080]  Those are examples of this stuff. How would this apply to
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.080]  different things.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:40.560]  Tomorrow we'll model planet Earth. I promised a key for E equals mc squared
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.560]  which I already showed you, but here it is.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:56.440]  That's a good example of a question where you can't rely on
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.480]  your intuition to get the answer. You have to follow the rules and get it.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:18.980]  I'm going to tape this back on.
