[00:00.120 --> 00:09.160]  I'm Bruce Bugbee and I'm here in our recording studio today to talk about low-cost LED fixtures
[00:09.160 --> 00:18.960]  for home horticulture. Now we do a lot of research on LEDs, color of LEDs, efficiency of LEDs, but we
[00:18.960 --> 00:27.720]  use high output LEDs that are expensive, hundreds of dollars, but there is a rapidly emerging market
[00:27.720 --> 00:35.520]  of many options of lights that are somewhere between $20 and $40 and they work wonderfully
[00:35.520 --> 00:44.440]  for home horticulture. At my house I have maybe a dozen of these lights over plants and if we cut
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.840]  away and went to my house you would see them, but they're giant house plants. There's a bird's-eye
[00:49.840 --> 00:57.280]  fern that's six feet tall under these lights and some peace lilies that are big. They're fabulous
[00:57.280 --> 01:04.120]  for growing plants in dark corners. They're also fabulous for growing leafy greens on your kitchen
[01:04.120 --> 01:13.200]  counter. You do not have to spend hundreds of dollars to get very useful effective lights. So
[01:13.200 --> 01:20.040]  what I want to do in the next few minutes is review these lights, show you examples of the
[01:20.040 --> 01:28.160]  ones that I have purchased and how they work, the advantages and disadvantage of all these lights
[01:28.160 --> 01:36.640]  to help you make better selections. So to start with that we're gonna go to the Amazon website
[01:36.640 --> 01:41.960]  which has lots of lights. You don't need to buy them from Amazon, but there's many options and I
[01:42.080 --> 01:48.440]  can quickly show you the options from their site and I can point out the pros and cons of the lights
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.680]  and we'll start with a little view of that and then we'll look at the lights themselves. So here
[01:53.680 --> 02:01.040]  we are. We just typed in LED grow light. Very generic search and all of these lights come up.
[02:01.040 --> 02:09.160]  Look we can scroll and scroll. There's dozens and dozens of lights on here. The first selection
[02:09.160 --> 02:18.960]  criteria is cost. Look at these that are here. $254, $450, even this one's $159. You do not need to pay
[02:18.960 --> 02:24.960]  that much. Maybe if you're growing cannabis you need high light, but we're talking about growing
[02:24.960 --> 02:31.600]  leafy greens, lettuce and basil and spinach and all of your favorite houseplants under these. You
[02:31.600 --> 02:41.040]  don't need lights like that. So you can screen down here for price. Under $25, $25 to $50. That's a
[02:41.040 --> 02:46.880]  useful screening feature, but for now let's just leave this. There's no single brand that's the
[02:46.880 --> 02:53.640]  best. These are all, they're made in China. Sometimes they're hard to tell who makes them.
[02:53.760 --> 03:04.000]  Here's the first point. We scroll up a little. Many of these lights are purple. Rule number one, do not buy
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.840]  purple lights. The reason they even exist is they're slightly more electrically efficient and
[03:11.840 --> 03:19.240]  you can save 10 cents a month on your electric bill, but they're horrible to look, work under.
[03:19.480 --> 03:26.680]  They're horrible to look, they make the plants look black. We no longer use those at all in our
[03:26.680 --> 03:34.120]  research and I don't recommend them because they're the really difficult color. They are finally
[03:34.760 --> 03:42.360]  going out of fashion. There's many more of the white LEDs than these. People say full spectrum.
[03:42.360 --> 03:48.120]  Well, that's fine. These are full spectrum lights, but it's not because they make the plants grow
[03:48.120 --> 03:54.280]  better. It's because they're much more pleasant to have in your house. The light quality is fine.
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.320]  Most of these now are a warm white color, like the warm white fluorescents you might have in a
[04:01.320 --> 04:08.840]  bathroom. Cool white means bright blue light and sometimes that can be a little bit harsh. It's so
[04:08.840 --> 04:15.640]  blue in your house. So warm white is a really excellent color. Most of these are warm white,
[04:15.640 --> 04:22.600]  but again, here's one that's not so bad, $80, but I said we're going to look at $20 to $40.
[04:23.480 --> 04:29.720]  So even this one is getting up there in cost. They don't give you a lot of specs. They give you a lot
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.480]  of seeming specs in these lights, but most of them don't mean much. Let's scroll down here
[04:36.600 --> 04:38.680]  to, we can probably just screen.
[04:39.640 --> 04:48.600]  On that first page, even this first page, it doesn't include any of the
[04:48.600 --> 04:59.800]  lights we've purchased. Let's just try this. $25 to $50. So we've edited this to the $25 to $50
[04:59.800 --> 05:06.600]  lights. There's many options. You get rid of the purple lights. Here's one. It's called the Gray
[05:06.600 --> 05:15.160]  Love SP1000. Let's take a look at that. This is not a light that I have purchased for analysis yet,
[05:15.160 --> 05:23.240]  but I looked at it before. It looks promising. It's a good sized light. They show us the
[05:23.800 --> 05:29.880]  size in here. $46. You get a lot of light from this. It might be overkill for some things.
[05:30.280 --> 05:36.840]  It's dimmable. You can use high, medium, and low. This shows the uniformity of the light.
[05:36.840 --> 05:41.320]  Oh, I got to be careful to touch this. Let's go back to that.
[05:45.480 --> 05:51.320]  This shows the spectra. It's warm white. It's got a lot of orange and red, not so much blue.
[05:52.120 --> 05:57.960]  And then after that, there's dimmable. That's what else comes in the package.
[05:58.040 --> 06:05.480]  This is a light worth considering in this. But if you look closely at this,
[06:06.440 --> 06:12.680]  these are LEDs mounted on a board and they're not focused. They'll shoot the light sideways.
[06:12.680 --> 06:18.280]  So they kind of light up your whole living room, whether you want it or not. It's possible to get
[06:18.280 --> 06:26.600]  lights with the LEDs indented, and then they're much more focused. Let's take a look.
[06:27.320 --> 06:35.800]  Let me take a look here. I'm not going to search for all these lights. Let's skip to
[06:37.080 --> 06:43.720]  this light right here. This one is a Yescom. This was one of the early lights. We started buying
[06:43.720 --> 06:53.720]  this one for research about five or six years ago. It used to be about $22. The prices crept up
[06:53.720 --> 06:59.640]  a little bit. This is a fine light, but it's a thin panel and it's one of those lights that
[06:59.640 --> 07:08.440]  shoots the light out sideways. So let me show you in a demonstration the effect of a light that's
[07:08.440 --> 07:14.600]  focused and one that's on a flat panel. And we've got lights set up right here.
[07:14.600 --> 07:30.760]  And I can wheel them in here and plug them in. We lost our yellow cord.
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.600]  I guess I'll shoot. The yellow cord went away, but I can plug them in here.
[07:37.240 --> 07:48.010]  And these are very rigged up here just so we can do this demo. And we'll get them flat.
[07:49.130 --> 07:59.530]  See if we can get this flat. If you can see this, this light on the left shoots the light sideways.
[08:00.570 --> 08:07.610]  Let's do these one at a time. This one is this light right here. Shoots the light sideways.
[08:07.610 --> 08:13.210]  And I'm going to unplug that. A little bit hard to see in the studio. You can see this is a
[08:14.090 --> 08:21.690]  cool white light. It's bright. Look at my hand. It looks white, not flesh colored,
[08:21.690 --> 08:27.930]  because this is a cool white. And the light shoots sideways out. And I have found this light
[08:27.930 --> 08:35.370]  is undesirable because of the sideways light. So for a little bit more money, we get
[08:35.770 --> 08:36.250]  we get
[08:39.930 --> 08:47.770]  this light, which I'm going to tilt it up so you can see it. Look at this. It's still not bright
[08:47.770 --> 08:55.130]  because the LEDs are in set and they're more focused. So this gives more light right below it.
[08:55.130 --> 09:02.330]  And this has less light pollution all over your house than this one. Let's take a look at the
[09:02.330 --> 09:12.410]  light output. To do this, you need a light meter, quantum sensor. These outputs are going to be
[09:12.410 --> 09:20.890]  similar. They take similar wattage. To do this, we got to hold the sensor similar distance. These
[09:20.890 --> 09:28.730]  are not bright lights. This one I'm getting 31 micromoles per meter squared per second.
[09:29.690 --> 09:32.410]  And this one I'm getting
[09:36.490 --> 09:43.690]  sorry, we got to get this back to the light. I didn't have it on the right setting. Let's do it
[09:43.690 --> 09:56.090]  again. This one I'm getting 460 below that light. And this one I am getting 460 below this light.
[09:56.650 --> 10:04.650]  So they're both a similar output. This light takes only 18 watts. This one takes 24 watts.
[10:04.650 --> 10:08.650]  So by virtue of being a little more focused, it's a little bit brighter right here.
[10:09.210 --> 10:15.530]  But the big difference is side lighting. And I have found these inset lights to be
[10:15.610 --> 10:23.610]  more helpful for this. Now let's wheel this away for the moment and look at these lights on the
[10:23.610 --> 10:31.290]  screen. Keep our meter right there.
[10:31.290 --> 10:32.490]  Keep our meter right there.
[10:39.610 --> 10:46.570]  We've got this set up to look at some other lights. Let me skip to this. Nope, skip to this
[10:46.570 --> 10:52.570]  one. This is the website for that focus light. You can see it's in depth. You can see the lights
[10:52.570 --> 10:58.010]  are inset. Nowhere do they show the picture of it, but they don't advertise that fixture here.
[10:58.890 --> 11:08.490]  This is a $21 light. So this is a little cheaper than the previous light. Again, you just got to
[11:08.490 --> 11:15.530]  scroll and look through these to find the lights with the features you want, because there's no
[11:16.170 --> 11:23.130]  clear identifying feature that would tell you search just for this light. Let's go back to
[11:23.130 --> 11:31.930]  another light right here. That's only $19.95, $20. Here's this light.
[11:34.090 --> 11:38.810]  We've gotten a lot of these, tested them. Comes in a real nice box. So if you want to give it
[11:38.810 --> 11:46.250]  as a gift to someone, this is a great box. Now let's take a look at the light. And I got to
[11:46.810 --> 12:02.320]  plug this in. This light has a switch. So this is a combination of reds and I'm going to not point
[12:02.320 --> 12:08.080]  these right at the camera, of reds and whites. So it's somewhat of a warm color. This is somewhat
[12:08.080 --> 12:15.360]  flexible. You can put these together. You can put them apart. There's two things. You put them
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.040]  under a shelf. So that's a bit of an advantage. Note these are not in set. So they give you a lot
[12:21.040 --> 12:30.400]  of side lighting. But this is called a, this is one that does have a name, asepal LED grow light.
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.200]  When these say 20 watts, that doesn't mean that's the power they take. That's some advertising
[12:37.200 --> 12:43.680]  thing similar to the, what the equivalent of an incandescent would be. But in this case,
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.200]  this one is about a 20 watt light. So this is a light worth considering
[12:50.800 --> 13:01.680]  because of the flexibility and low cost. Now let's look at that one, that one, this one.
[13:07.790 --> 13:14.910]  Here's another warm white, one in a box. I don't want to do that.
[13:16.030 --> 13:25.550]  Here is one that is purple. It's got a few blues in it, but it's purple. When I hit the reorder
[13:25.550 --> 13:33.230]  on this light at Amazon, the light I ordered did not come up with the exact website. A purple light
[13:33.230 --> 13:39.230]  came up. So apparently this manufacturer has replaced their wonderful warm white light with
[13:39.230 --> 13:47.870]  a purple light. So it's unfortunate, but you got to be careful to screen these. And then finally,
[13:47.870 --> 13:55.390]  this is the, this is one that we haven't tested, but it's another possibility. You can go in here
[13:55.390 --> 14:06.590]  and count the LEDs on the, from their pictures. But this is the $45 roughly gets you twice the
[14:07.550 --> 14:14.510]  amount of light as a $20 light. But these are sort of overkill. They have more light than you really
[14:14.510 --> 14:24.190]  would need for most plants. I think that's all I want to say about these. Buy them and use them.
[14:24.910 --> 14:30.510]  It will enrich your life. They put them, you need them on a time clock. So you have to buy a little,
[14:31.230 --> 14:40.030]  some of them have timers and you buy a time clock and keep them on. One more thing. I forgot to show
[14:40.030 --> 14:49.150]  you one light. Here's a box. This is a light that comes in tubes and you open the box and
[14:49.150 --> 15:02.830]  the light looks like this. And we've mounted those tubes on a piece of styrofoam here. Plug it in
[15:03.470 --> 15:11.470]  here. I could plug this one in. This is also a fine light. This one's got a switch.
[15:11.950 --> 15:21.710]  This one's dimmable so we can do multiple levels, but this is a nice one because you can put these
[15:21.710 --> 15:27.070]  in long linear strips. This is one of the defining characteristics, but you can see lots of lights
[15:27.070 --> 15:36.750]  now with warm white LEDs. That's a great thing or options. So let's take a look at what it costs to
[15:37.070 --> 15:46.190]  run these lights per month on your electric bill because people get concerned and rightly so.
[15:46.830 --> 15:55.310]  So here's one. Most of these lights are about 20 watts. So it's the same as a 20 watt light bulb.
[15:55.870 --> 16:01.310]  So what does that cost? So if we have, let's get our pen up here.
[16:01.870 --> 16:13.150]  If we have 20 watts times, we're going to run these for 16 hours HR per day. That's a typical
[16:13.150 --> 16:17.790]  time. You don't want them to run at night. Keeps people up and some plants don't like to have light
[16:17.790 --> 16:26.910]  all the time. So 20 times 16 is 320 watt hours. This is watt hours per day.
[16:27.230 --> 16:36.830]  And this is 0.32 kilowatt hours. That's just how we pay for electricity, kilowatt hours.
[16:37.470 --> 16:47.230]  So it takes 0.32 kilowatt hours per day. And now let's take that times 10 cents
[16:47.710 --> 16:55.070]  per kilowatt hour. This is a real typical price for residential electricity. You can see the math
[16:55.070 --> 17:12.670]  that cancels out. This equals 3.2 cents per day. Or 30 days in a month. We're about $1.00
[17:12.990 --> 17:24.400]  per month to run a 20 watt light. $12 a year. I submit that unless you're really out of money,
[17:24.960 --> 17:29.520]  that's some of the best $12 in a year you're going to spend is running these lights and growing
[17:29.520 --> 17:36.720]  great plants. They don't cost much. If you get a big one, a bright one, this might go, let's put
[17:36.880 --> 17:42.480]  that in a different color here, red, they might get up to, no, red's not a good color, blue.
[17:42.480 --> 17:48.400]  They might get up to 40 watts, but then everything doubles. And if it's a 40 watt,
[17:49.280 --> 17:56.320]  now you're looking at $2 a month. Still a lot of money to spend.
[17:56.320 --> 18:03.840]  So that's the math. And then you can see that the cost of the light is $1.00 a month.
[18:04.800 --> 18:13.120]  Still not expensive. Big lights for LEDs. Now we're talking much more. Now we're talking
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.960]  100 times this easily to get bright light to grow real high light crop plants. But none of the
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.040]  plants we're talking about are high light. So there's the math and the cost per month.
[18:25.360 --> 18:37.840]  So I would like to walk over here and show you our Venus flytrap research that we have going on
[18:38.800 --> 18:50.440]  with one of these lights. We've done a lot of research on nutrition of Venus flytraps.
[18:50.440 --> 18:55.320]  Here's a few of them. Most of the research is done now. But here's one of these lights,
[18:55.880 --> 19:01.720]  warm white mounted under the counter, focused. You can see my hand looks flesh colored under
[19:01.720 --> 19:07.640]  this light. The plants grow great. This is just a little lid to keep them healthy. These are
[19:07.640 --> 19:13.160]  really healthy Venus flytrap plants, and we've had them a long time in here. So it's a really
[19:13.160 --> 19:20.920]  good example of what you can do with lights. Venus flytraps are tricky to grow, but under this steady
[19:20.920 --> 19:27.160]  light, they love it. Keep a lid on to keep a little bit higher humidity. You can see one of
[19:27.160 --> 19:36.920]  them's flowering in here. So there's an example of these lights. Thanks for listening. I hope this
[19:36.920 --> 19:43.400]  video inspires you to buy some of these lights for home horticulture.
