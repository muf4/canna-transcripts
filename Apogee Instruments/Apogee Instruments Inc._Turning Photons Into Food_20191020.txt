[00:00.700 --> 00:15.200]  I'm Bruce Bugbee. I'm a professor of crop physiology at Utah State University, and this is a seminar about calculating potential yield of any agricultural commodity.
[00:15.200 --> 00:27.700]  It was first developed for fields like this and for outdoor agriculture, but over the years we have modified this model, which is a series of calculations,
[00:27.700 --> 00:41.200]  to get potential yield in indoor agriculture. And as we get better and better with indoor agriculture, it becomes increasingly important to understand what the potential is.
[00:41.200 --> 00:51.200]  In this talk, in the next 20-25 minutes, I'm going to derive the potential yield from what we call first principles.
[00:52.200 --> 01:06.200]  But first, I want to acknowledge the funding agencies for this, and NASA is a key funding agency. They funded the research in my lab for over 30 years,
[01:06.200 --> 01:14.200]  and we've been deeply indebted to NASA for allowing us to keep refining these models.
[01:14.200 --> 01:28.700]  Recently, we also got funded by the USDA, and this is a project, much more applied project, to look at the use of supplemental lighting in controlled environments.
[01:28.700 --> 01:35.700]  This project is called the LAMP project, Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits.
[01:35.700 --> 01:50.200]  So this is a very basic research project. This is a very applied research project. And back and forth, we zero in on the reality of what we can get for food production in controlled environments.
[01:50.200 --> 02:13.200]  So, let's now show you the units of this calculation. One gram per mole of photons. This is an output from the system, one gram of dry biomass, or one gram of yield, per mole of photosynthetic photons.
[02:13.200 --> 02:26.200]  So it's output divided by input, which is the efficiency of the system. Now just quickly, I can show you how we derive this. And let's make sure we're on black.
[02:26.200 --> 02:49.700]  One gram, let's put it right over here. A gram per meter squared of ground area per day, divided by a mole of photons per meter squared of ground area per day.
[02:50.200 --> 03:10.200]  And you can see the meter squareds of days cancel out, and we get grams per mole. This mole per meter squared right here is called the daily light integral, DLI. It's a common measurement, moles per meter squared per day.
[03:11.200 --> 03:25.700]  This is just biomass. This is tricky, calculating the exact area, because we get guard row effects. But these are the input parameters to this. Now, where do these come from, and how can we calculate yield?
[03:25.700 --> 03:46.200]  I want to start by examining what to any plant biologist is the most important equation in the world. Now when I show this to physicist colleagues, they're pretty sure the most important equation in the world is E equals mc squared.
[03:47.200 --> 04:00.700]  Who do you think this is? The most important equation in the world, particularly to any life scientist. Here it is. Equations are inputs, and they go to outputs.
[04:01.700 --> 04:23.200]  Now, this is in every single high school biology textbook. It's in every textbook in college. We have 20 courses on college campuses that emphasize this equation. Of course, it helps to know what this is. That is carbohydrate, CH2O.
[04:24.200 --> 04:44.700]  And this equation, by now you've figured it out. This is photosynthesis. So now we look at this. This takes a low...let's get a different color here. This takes a low energy gas, CO2. We use it to put out fires.
[04:44.700 --> 05:05.200]  And water. Two really simple molecules, very low energy, and it makes a high energy solid, food, and well, O2 is rocket fuel. So we get two very high energy outputs from two very low energy inputs.
[05:05.200 --> 05:25.700]  We often, we don't think about a lot. We make students memorize the stoichiometry, but the energetics of this is what's really important. Now, remember, the first law of thermodynamics says energy in equals energy out.
[05:28.870 --> 05:50.370]  Everything has to follow the first law. How do we get two really low input molecules to go to two high input molecules? The answer is, in more advanced books, light. And particularly photons, and particularly 10 photons.
[05:50.870 --> 06:09.870]  This is the close to the theoretical minimum number of photons to push this equation across. So, how are we going to derive grams per mole of photons from this 10 photons? Every book has this in it. The advanced books have the photons.
[06:09.870 --> 06:27.370]  This has always disturbed me that it's written like this because it doesn't capture for our students the magnificence of this equation and how do you get these high energy outputs. So, I would like to propose that we revise the way we write this equation.
[06:27.370 --> 06:53.870]  Here's the Earth. Boom! Here is our low energy inputs and here is our high energy outputs. And it's many steps to get up there. And now, how do you get uphill from low energy to high energy? We bring in those 10 photons. Kaboom! There's a lot of energy in those photons. Now the energy balances because the 10 photons drive it uphill.
[06:54.870 --> 07:16.700]  When we calculate the efficiency of this, and efficiency is, I'm going to abbreviate it, I'll write it out. Efficiency of any system is just the output over the input.
[07:17.700 --> 07:44.560]  So, the output is carbohydrate and the input is 10 photons. When we do this ratio, we get 30% efficient in theory. Here it is. Theoretical maximum. 30%. That doesn't sound very good for a theoretical maximum.
[07:45.560 --> 08:05.060]  And engineers look at this and say, oh my goodness, 30%? That's all your important equation can do? And this bothered me for a while. So, I thought, wait a minute. I look at the biochemistry and this is not one big step. This is many, many little steps. This goes to this and then this goes to this.
[08:06.060 --> 08:28.560]  When we start to add up all those steps, if you assume there's 23 steps, and that's about right, and each step is 95% efficient, now look at the math in this. If we take 0.95 to the 23rd power, that's 30% efficient.
[08:29.060 --> 08:50.060]  So, we should start thinking about photosynthesis as 23 automated steps, each one's 95% efficient, and out the end we get carbohydrates and food energy. This is where this whole analysis comes from, is this equation balancing.
[08:50.060 --> 09:02.560]  Now, let's look at these 10 photons. They, that's the theoretical minimum. How close can we get to that when we measure this in a plant?
[09:03.060 --> 09:25.060]  Here's a graph of photosynthetic photon flux density down here. Increasing light, zero is dark, go all the way up to a thousand. And this is the quantum yield. So, this ratio, moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons absorbed is called quantum yield.
[09:25.560 --> 09:41.560]  Remember I said 10? 10 is called the quantum requirement, this. So, 1 over 10 is 0.1. So, same thing, just different units. Now look at this. We can't quite get to 10, but we get close up here.
[09:42.060 --> 10:00.060]  The type of plant really doesn't matter as long as it's a nice green leaf. Tomatoes, spinach, different kind of tomato. In this case, Grand Rapids leaf is quite a light yellow leaf, and it had a little bit lower quantum yield.
[10:00.560 --> 10:19.560]  Now, when I say the leaf doesn't matter, purple. Purple leaf lettuce, that is full of anthocyanins, and anthocyanins are a protective pigment in leaves. They absorb solar energy, and they don't fix carbon in photosynthesis.
[10:19.560 --> 10:35.060]  So, when we have purple leaf cultivars, their quantum yield is fundamentally less than nice green leaf cultivars. We only get to these very low, very high quantum yields and very low light.
[10:35.060 --> 10:59.560]  So, if we're going to be more real about this, let's assume that we're growing the plants at 400 micromoles, more typical, and we go up here, and we go across here, and we're at a quantum yield of 0.08 and a quantum requirement of 12.
[11:00.060 --> 11:10.060]  So, let's take this now and refine our model of grams per mole of photons.
[11:11.060 --> 11:33.030]  There's 400. We know that carbohydrate is 30 grams per mole. This is pretty simple. Carbohydrate is 12, hydrogen adds 2, oxygen adds 16. That's 30 grams per mole.
[11:34.030 --> 11:48.530]  12 moles of photons gives us 30 grams of biomass, and the efficiency of this system then, output over input, is 30 grams per 12, 2.5.
[11:49.030 --> 11:58.530]  This is significantly higher than what we talked about a minute ago with 1 gram per mole of photons. What's the difference in this?
[11:59.030 --> 12:13.030]  The key here is that this is one way, when we run this in the light, the first stable product out of photosynthesis is not just carbohydrate, it's sucrose.
[12:13.530 --> 12:24.530]  If we're only running it one direction, we get sucrose, and even sugarcane is not pure sucrose.
[12:25.030 --> 12:30.530]  We have proteins in plants, lipids, lignin, cellulose, all kinds of other things.
[12:31.530 --> 12:36.030]  How do those things get made if we're running this only to get sucrose?
[12:36.530 --> 12:55.030]  They get made at night, and they get made continuously by running this equation backwards this direction, and then we get ATP energy,
[12:55.530 --> 13:00.030]  and that ATP is used to synthesize all the other things in plants.
[13:00.530 --> 13:04.030]  When we run it backwards, we call it respiration.
[13:04.530 --> 13:16.030]  So, respiration takes about 40% of this. After we get here, about 40% is run backwards to make everything else in plants.
[13:17.030 --> 13:25.030]  This is, we can measure this rigorously by canopy gas exchange.
[13:25.530 --> 13:29.530]  This is a picture of some of our chambers. They're little transparent chambers.
[13:30.030 --> 13:35.530]  We measure the gases coming in and out. We keep track of all the CO2 in this system,
[13:36.530 --> 13:45.530]  and we can keep track of the exact number of photons from minute to minute, the exact rate of sucrose production, and then respiration.
[13:46.030 --> 13:50.530]  Now, respiration runs in the light and the dark all the time, so it's running back and forth.
[13:51.030 --> 13:56.030]  So, we never get 2.5 grams of biomass that would only be sucrose.
[13:56.530 --> 14:01.030]  How efficient is respiration? 60%.
[14:04.770 --> 14:10.770]  I'm off the edge of the screen. I'm going to go back. 60%.
[14:11.770 --> 14:16.770]  Respiration is net photosynthesis divided by gross photosynthesis.
[14:17.270 --> 14:21.770]  We also call that daily carbon gain divided by gross photosynthesis.
[14:21.770 --> 14:23.270]  That ratio is about 60.
[14:24.270 --> 14:27.270]  60, how do we get up to that number?
[14:27.770 --> 14:33.270]  Jonathan France was a PhD student with me many years ago, and he spent his whole time studying this.
[14:33.770 --> 14:39.270]  Couldn't we make respiration more efficient? Couldn't we get this higher than 60%?
[14:39.770 --> 14:43.270]  And we eventually did. We got it to like 65%.
[14:43.770 --> 14:49.270]  We couldn't improve it much. Cold nights, long days, continuous light.
[14:49.770 --> 14:53.770]  We were close to fixed at 60%.
[14:54.270 --> 15:06.770]  So now, we take 2.5, going this way, times 60% equals, now we're down to 1.5 grams per mole.
[15:07.270 --> 15:13.770]  And we call this number photon conversion efficacy, or PCE.
[15:14.770 --> 15:21.270]  So, in the first slide I said we can get 1 gram per mole of photons.
[15:21.770 --> 15:23.270]  This is 1.5.
[15:24.270 --> 15:30.270]  But this number assumes every photon gets absorbed by the plants.
[15:30.770 --> 15:33.270]  None of them bounce off. None of them hit the ground.
[15:33.770 --> 15:38.270]  100% of the photons get absorbed, and that never happens.
[15:38.270 --> 15:43.770]  Even in a perfect canopy, a few percent bounce off and go back up to the ceiling.
[15:44.270 --> 15:49.770]  Some hit the walls, and even worse, some hit the ground without hitting a leaf.
[15:50.270 --> 15:51.770]  And those are completely gone.
[15:52.270 --> 15:59.770]  To go from this perfect system where we just have photosynthesis and respiration to a real system,
[16:00.270 --> 16:03.770]  we need a little more sophisticated model.
[16:04.270 --> 16:10.270]  And that sophisticated model is called the energy cascade model.
[16:11.270 --> 16:16.270]  That I've worked on with other people for many years, and we have several papers about it.
[16:16.770 --> 16:18.270]  Here's the model.
[16:19.770 --> 16:24.270]  The first, here's our two parameters right here that we're talking about.
[16:24.770 --> 16:32.270]  And in this typical case right here, I'm using 0.06 because if it's higher light levels,
[16:32.270 --> 16:34.770]  we get a little lower quantum yield.
[16:35.270 --> 16:39.770]  But the very first step in this model is fraction of absorbed photons.
[16:40.270 --> 16:41.770]  And we're assuming 80%.
[16:42.270 --> 16:45.770]  This number is more like 50% in typical field production.
[16:46.270 --> 16:52.770]  But with high planting density and maybe systems to move the plants apart, we capture more photons.
[16:53.770 --> 17:06.270]  80% times quantum yield times carbon use efficiency gives us biomass per mole of incident photons.
[17:06.770 --> 17:09.270]  And finally, the fourth one is called harvest index.
[17:09.770 --> 17:15.270]  That's the ratio of usable or edible product to total plant biomass.
[17:15.770 --> 17:21.270]  In the case of lettuce, this number is 80-85%.
[17:21.270 --> 17:26.770]  We don't eat the roots. We don't eat the stem base. Lettuce is almost completely edible.
[17:27.270 --> 17:31.770]  But in a typical crop plants, we're at 50% wheat and rice.
[17:32.270 --> 17:35.770]  They'd be tremendous if we could get those to 50%.
[17:36.270 --> 17:38.770]  They're more like 40% typically.
[17:39.270 --> 17:45.770]  So we take this. We get moles of carbon fixed per mole of photons.
[17:45.770 --> 17:53.270]  And now we multiply by 30 grams per mole and we're down to 0.4 grams per mole.
[17:53.770 --> 17:59.270]  Well below our 1 gram per mole that I advertised on that first slide.
[17:59.770 --> 18:02.270]  So now let's look at potential.
[18:02.770 --> 18:05.270]  What do we have to do to get this up to 1?
[18:05.770 --> 18:07.270]  Here's a set of numbers.
[18:07.770 --> 18:14.270]  If we improve each one of these just slightly, we get that 80% absorbed to 90%.
[18:14.270 --> 18:15.770]  Slight improvement.
[18:16.270 --> 18:19.770]  Quantum yield. We get it from 0.06 to 0.08.
[18:20.270 --> 18:21.770]  Low light and try to...
[18:22.270 --> 18:26.770]  It's one thing to get 0.08 but keep it there over the whole life cycle when the plants are old.
[18:27.270 --> 18:29.770]  Try to still have this high quantum yield.
[18:30.270 --> 18:34.770]  Improve carbon use efficiency to 0.65.
[18:35.270 --> 18:37.770]  Go to a very high harvest index crop.
[18:38.270 --> 18:39.770]  Multiply these together.
[18:40.270 --> 18:41.770]  Now we're at 1 gram per mole.
[18:42.270 --> 18:44.270]  There's the magic 1 gram per mole.
[18:44.770 --> 18:47.270]  This is the potential yield.
[18:47.770 --> 18:54.270]  And in some systems where we very carefully measure this, we can get 1 gram per mole.
[18:54.770 --> 18:57.270]  It is not an average. It's a potential.
[18:57.770 --> 19:01.270]  And you've got to hit it every single day of the life cycle.
[19:01.770 --> 19:05.270]  Very hard to do but it's still a potential yield.
[19:06.270 --> 19:15.770]  Most indoor farms that we have analyzed are down around 0.4 grams per mole now.
[19:16.270 --> 19:20.770]  Mostly because they're not absorbing all the light up here.
[19:21.270 --> 19:23.770]  Many of the photons don't fall on leaves.
[19:24.270 --> 19:30.770]  By the way, this quantum yield only is achievable with very elevated CO2.
[19:31.270 --> 19:33.770]  Like 1,200 parts per million.
[19:33.770 --> 19:35.270]  It's 400 outside.
[19:35.770 --> 19:38.270]  That causes photorespiration.
[19:38.770 --> 19:39.270]  We can't have that.
[19:39.770 --> 19:42.270]  To get to this number you have to have high CO2.
[19:42.770 --> 19:46.270]  It'd be much less than this without high CO2.
[19:46.770 --> 19:51.270]  But we can enrich with CO2 in indoor agriculture.
[19:51.770 --> 19:55.270]  This approach came from this article right here.
[19:55.770 --> 19:58.270]  Exploring the limits of crop productivity.
[19:58.270 --> 20:03.770]  This productivity that I wrote with my colleague Frank Salisbury about, well, 1988.
[20:04.270 --> 20:05.770]  That's over 30 years ago.
[20:06.270 --> 20:11.770]  This particular article helped launch my career as a young scientist.
[20:12.270 --> 20:16.770]  Showing the math and showing what we could get to in potential yield.
[20:17.270 --> 20:21.770]  And of course we did this with wheat and keep track of all those parameters.
[20:22.270 --> 20:23.770]  And that was the basis of the paper.
[20:23.770 --> 20:35.270]  So, now let's look, after we calculate potential yield, let's do an economic analysis of indoor ag.
[20:35.770 --> 20:38.270]  We know the cost of electricity.
[20:38.770 --> 20:44.270]  If we know we could get one gram per mole, what's the economics of this?
[20:44.770 --> 20:49.270]  This is, what I'm going to show you on this slide now, is the basis from this paper.
[20:49.270 --> 20:53.770]  It was a paper, an article we got published in Nature.
[20:54.270 --> 20:58.770]  LEDs for photons, physiology, and food.
[20:59.270 --> 21:01.770]  This is just last year, 2018.
[21:02.270 --> 21:07.770]  Assuming 10 cents a kilowatt hour, which is a sort of a national average.
[21:08.270 --> 21:12.770]  Cost of photons as a percent of the market price.
[21:13.270 --> 21:15.770]  So we took the market price as high as we could get.
[21:16.770 --> 21:19.270]  Gourmet, premium quality lettuce.
[21:19.770 --> 21:22.270]  And look at this, 1 and 5 percent.
[21:24.770 --> 21:32.270]  No wonder people are rushing to do indoor agriculture for leafy microgreens and for lettuce.
[21:33.770 --> 21:42.270]  But, most of the facilities now where we have 5 percent, they're at more like 30 percent
[21:43.270 --> 21:47.770]  of the cost of photons as a percent of market price.
[21:48.270 --> 21:51.770]  And that's because the systems are not yet optimized.
[21:52.270 --> 21:58.770]  They can run with 30 percent energy, but they could get down to 5 percent.
[21:59.270 --> 22:02.770]  Now, let's look at tomatoes in this system.
[22:03.270 --> 22:07.770]  Tomatoes have a much lower harvest index.
[22:08.270 --> 22:11.770]  You throw away the leaves and stems and roots, you only eat the tomatoes.
[22:12.270 --> 22:15.770]  The tomatoes don't have as much water as lettuce.
[22:16.270 --> 22:18.770]  Lettuce is 95 percent water.
[22:19.270 --> 22:22.770]  And we only need photosynthesis to grow the 5 percent that's dry weight.
[22:23.270 --> 22:24.770]  But tomatoes are much harder.
[22:25.270 --> 22:27.770]  When we go to tomatoes, we get 18 percent.
[22:28.270 --> 22:30.770]  It's harder to grow tomatoes than these.
[22:31.270 --> 22:37.770]  Still possible, but it's, boy, we're going to have to have optimal conditions to ever think about growing tomatoes.
[22:38.270 --> 22:39.770]  Now let's look at other vegetables.
[22:40.270 --> 22:41.770]  Let's take broccoli.
[22:42.270 --> 22:43.770]  Broccoli we can't sell.
[22:44.270 --> 22:49.770]  Stems, leaves, roots, and broccoli is more dry weight and less water, and it commands,
[22:50.270 --> 22:54.770]  it doesn't command the premium price that lettuce and tomatoes do.
[22:55.270 --> 23:02.770]  General vegetables, the cost of the photons is equal to the market value of the product.
[23:03.270 --> 23:08.770]  So unless we can find a way to get consumers to pay a lot more for general vegetables,
[23:08.770 --> 23:14.270]  including things like strawberries, it's going to be very, very difficult.
[23:14.770 --> 23:19.270]  And by this analysis, at 10 cents a kilowatt hour, it's not going to be cost effective.
[23:19.770 --> 23:26.270]  The electric cost is going to be equal to the market value, and you still have labor, you have depreciation,
[23:26.770 --> 23:30.270]  you have lots of other costs besides the photon costs.
[23:30.270 --> 23:34.770]  Even worse, rice or wheat.
[23:36.270 --> 23:41.770]  The value of the photons is a hundred times greater than the value of the rice and wheat.
[23:42.270 --> 23:45.770]  We are never going to grow our staple crops without sunlight.
[23:46.270 --> 23:49.770]  We need free sunlight to grow these staple crops.
[23:50.270 --> 23:56.770]  One way to look at this, the rapidly increasing cost of photons, is the market price.
[23:56.770 --> 24:00.270]  These are high market price, these are low market price.
[24:00.770 --> 24:02.270]  That's what drives this cost of photons up.
[24:02.770 --> 24:05.270]  And then secondly, the harvest index.
[24:05.770 --> 24:10.270]  These have a high harvest index and it decreases down to 50%.
[24:10.770 --> 24:20.270]  There are tomato lines that are 70%, so we could potentially do a little bit better with tomatoes.
[24:20.770 --> 24:26.270]  The point here is tomatoes are much, much harder to grow though than lettuce and indoor egg.
[24:27.770 --> 24:34.270]  Now let's do an analysis of what we could do, and this is my final set of slides in this talk,
[24:34.770 --> 24:46.270]  what we could do with solar panels and LEDs so that we didn't have to use fossil fuels to get all that electricity.
[24:46.770 --> 24:48.270]  Let's analyze this.
[24:48.770 --> 24:51.270]  What we're going to compare, this is sunlight.
[24:51.270 --> 24:59.770]  If we do total energy in sunlight, it's 30 megajoules per meter squared per day of total shortwave energy,
[25:00.270 --> 25:04.770]  and 60 moles of photosynthetic photons per day.
[25:05.270 --> 25:11.770]  Now this is what drives the photosynthesis, and the first step here is this is what drives solar panels.
[25:12.270 --> 25:13.770]  So let's do this side first.
[25:14.270 --> 25:18.770]  60 moles comes through a greenhouse, 70% transmission.
[25:18.770 --> 25:27.270]  This is a good greenhouse. It's a design goal for a greenhouse, and obviously we get with this, we get 42 moles.
[25:27.770 --> 25:30.270]  70% of this transmitted to the plant canopy.
[25:30.770 --> 25:32.270]  Now let's analyze this side.
[25:32.770 --> 25:36.270]  First step, photovoltaic panels, 20% efficient.
[25:36.770 --> 25:47.270]  So that's 30, goes to 6 moles per meter squared per day that is captured as electricity from the sun per meter squared of solar panels.
[25:47.270 --> 25:51.770]  Now we take the electricity, put it through LEDs.
[25:52.270 --> 26:01.770]  Our very best LEDs can get to 3 micromoles per joule of photons.
[26:02.270 --> 26:03.770]  Micromoles of photons per joule.
[26:04.270 --> 26:11.770]  This is 10 to the, m is 10 to the 6, this is 10 to the minus 6, so this is 3 times 6, 18.
[26:12.770 --> 26:19.270]  Moles of photons delivered to the plant canopy with solar photo takes, and it's 42 here.
[26:19.770 --> 26:22.270]  This is a bigger number than this.
[26:22.770 --> 26:35.270]  It takes more than two times the area of solar panels to make the equivalent of what we could get in a greenhouse with nothing, just a glass greenhouse.
[26:35.770 --> 26:38.270]  So I made a diagram to emphasize that point.
[26:38.770 --> 26:41.770]  Two point, this is solar panels in a field.
[26:42.270 --> 26:46.770]  2.3 acres of solar panels feeding electricity to light up one area.
[26:47.270 --> 26:54.770]  So we're not there for direct use of solar energy through LEDs.
[26:55.270 --> 26:59.770]  But you say, yeah, solar panels are getting better. LEDs are getting better.
[27:00.270 --> 27:03.770]  Now let's calculate the potential of this.
[27:04.270 --> 27:11.270]  What if we peer into the future and look at what solar panels could be and what LEDs could be?
[27:11.770 --> 27:13.270]  Can we get this ratio better?
[27:13.770 --> 27:16.270]  Here's the same graph potential.
[27:16.770 --> 27:18.270]  This, I kept this the same, 70%.
[27:18.770 --> 27:23.270]  We might get this higher with special coverings, but let's keep this side the same.
[27:23.770 --> 27:25.270]  Now we go to 30% solar panels.
[27:25.770 --> 27:29.270]  Now these, the stuff we fly on satellites, they're expensive.
[27:29.770 --> 27:31.270]  They're 30%.
[27:32.270 --> 27:33.770]  So it's possible to get these.
[27:34.270 --> 27:39.770]  And at some point in the future, we'll have consumer panels that are 30% efficient.
[27:40.270 --> 27:51.770]  And the reason they're so efficient is they can use energy out here in shortwave energy by layering cells that photosynthesis can't use.
[27:52.270 --> 27:54.770]  Photosynthesis uses this part of the curve.
[27:55.770 --> 28:01.270]  And solar panels, by layering them, can use these low energy near-infrared photons.
[28:01.770 --> 28:03.270]  So they get to 30%.
[28:04.770 --> 28:07.270]  Now we've captured 9 megajoules of electricity.
[28:07.770 --> 28:17.270]  Now the theoretical maximum, if we had 100% efficient LEDs, which we're really not going to get there, but we might get to 90%, 95%.
[28:17.770 --> 28:19.270]  We can get close.
[28:19.770 --> 28:23.270]  9.7 times 4.7, 42.
[28:24.270 --> 28:29.770]  So potentially we could have a system where it's one-to-one.
[28:30.270 --> 28:34.770]  The one acre of solar panels feeds one acre of plants, and they don't have a greenhouse.
[28:35.270 --> 28:41.770]  Now this is the cost of building a greenhouse versus all these high efficiency solar panels and LEDs.
[28:42.270 --> 28:43.770]  This doesn't show economics.
[28:44.270 --> 28:46.770]  It just shows energy flow in this system.
[28:48.270 --> 28:49.770]  So one final slide.
[28:50.770 --> 28:59.270]  This is from a recent paper that is now in review with my colleague Paul Kusuma and Morgan Pattison.
[28:59.770 --> 29:05.270]  It's called, From Physics to Fixtures to Food, Potential Efficacy of LEDs.
[29:05.770 --> 29:07.270]  This is peering into the future.
[29:07.770 --> 29:13.270]  These numbers come from the chip manufacturers of LEDs.
[29:13.770 --> 29:16.270]  Not the ones that make the fixtures, just the ones that make the chip.
[29:16.770 --> 29:18.270]  How good can they get those chips?
[29:19.270 --> 29:20.770]  Here's the colors we use.
[29:21.270 --> 29:23.770]  We use blues, we use reds, we use far reds, and we use whites.
[29:24.270 --> 29:26.770]  And cool white is the most efficient of the whites.
[29:27.270 --> 29:28.770]  Look at these efficiencies.
[29:29.270 --> 29:34.770]  Now this is watts of photosynthetic energy out per watt of electricity in.
[29:35.270 --> 29:38.770]  Wow! 88% for blue LEDs.
[29:39.270 --> 29:40.770]  That is really impressive.
[29:41.270 --> 29:45.770]  Whites are phosphor-converted blue.
[29:45.770 --> 29:49.270]  So they take blue with a phosphor and we get white.
[29:49.770 --> 29:52.270]  So there's some loss in that.
[29:52.770 --> 29:54.270]  And so whites are 80%.
[29:54.770 --> 29:57.270]  And the reds are less and the far reds are less.
[29:57.770 --> 30:02.270]  Now this is energy, but remember energy doesn't drive photosynthesis.
[30:02.770 --> 30:04.270]  The number of photons do.
[30:04.770 --> 30:11.270]  So this column is the micromoles of photons per joule.
[30:11.770 --> 30:13.270]  Let me review this number.
[30:14.270 --> 30:24.770]  This is micromoles per second over joules per second.
[30:25.270 --> 30:29.770]  And the seconds cancel so it is just micromoles per joule.
[30:30.270 --> 30:32.770]  And a joule per second is a watt.
[30:33.270 --> 30:35.770]  So it simplifies to micromoles per joule.
[30:36.270 --> 30:37.770]  Look at these numbers.
[30:38.270 --> 30:40.770]  3.3 up to 4.
[30:41.270 --> 30:42.770]  These are impressive numbers.
[30:43.270 --> 30:49.770]  The picture is not this good yet, but on the horizon we could see where they could get this good for these colors of light.
[30:50.270 --> 30:52.770]  Now I got a final box here that I haven't shown you yet.
[30:53.270 --> 30:54.770]  What's in that box?
[30:55.270 --> 30:59.770]  If there's efficiency shown this way, efficacy.
[31:00.270 --> 31:02.770]  What about the cost of these?
[31:03.270 --> 31:08.770]  Which do you think is the most cost-effective, the easiest to make?
[31:09.770 --> 31:13.270]  Most lighting, almost all lighting, is for humans.
[31:13.770 --> 31:17.270]  And so humans need white LEDs.
[31:17.770 --> 31:24.270]  So the white LEDs are much, much cheaper just because of economy of scale of this.
[31:24.770 --> 31:26.270]  So now let's look at the price.
[31:26.770 --> 31:27.270]  Wow.
[31:27.770 --> 31:33.270]  1x for whites and we go to 10x for reds and 30x for these.
[31:33.270 --> 31:35.770]  These drive the cost of fixtures.
[31:36.270 --> 31:40.770]  That drive the cost of what we're going to do in indoor agriculture.
[31:41.270 --> 31:46.770]  So this is a peering into the future and looking at what we can produce.
[31:47.270 --> 31:57.770]  All of our analysis indicates that leafy greens can be very cost-effective once we get the systems optimized.
[31:57.770 --> 32:11.270]  Tomatoes would be much harder and things like strawberries and broccoli are extremely difficult to ever produce without free sunlight.
[32:11.770 --> 32:13.270]  Thanks for listening.
[32:13.770 --> 32:17.270]  I look forward to another video with you.
