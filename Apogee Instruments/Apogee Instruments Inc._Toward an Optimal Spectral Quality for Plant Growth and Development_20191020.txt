[00:01.600 --> 00:11.360]  I'm Bruce Bugbee and in this video I want to talk about our research over, especially over the last 10 years,
[00:11.360 --> 00:21.840]  and even over the last 20 years, of the effects of colors of light on photosynthesis and plant shape.
[00:21.840 --> 00:31.120]  And I'm calling this towards an optimal spectral quality for plant growth and development.
[00:31.200 --> 00:39.280]  Now, what do we mean by plant growth and development? When we say plant growth,
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.680]  we mean an increase in dry weight of the plants and that directly comes from photosynthesis.
[00:47.040 --> 00:52.720]  When we say development, we mostly mean plant shape. Is it a tall skinny plant,
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.760]  the short fat plant? You can see you could have the same size plant with very different shapes.
[00:58.720 --> 01:06.560]  Spectral quality has an effect on photosynthesis, but it has a much bigger effect on plant shape.
[01:06.560 --> 01:13.760]  And most of the time when we're changing ratios of colors, we're doing it to affect plant shape.
[01:13.760 --> 01:16.720]  And I'll walk through this, both plant growth and development.
[01:17.840 --> 01:24.080]  Plant shape varies among species. Different species have different responses to spectral
[01:24.080 --> 01:34.000]  quality. Photosynthesis does not vary among species much at all, but you will see there's
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.640]  evidence that our historic definition of photosynthetic photons is now coming into question.
[01:41.920 --> 01:49.040]  So I first want to acknowledge NASA. They have funded my laboratory now for over 30 years,
[01:49.040 --> 01:56.640]  and that has allowed us to do some very basic research on spectral quality on photosynthesis
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.800]  and development. We also recently got a grant from the USDA. It's through the University of Georgia.
[02:02.800 --> 02:10.000]  It is called the LAMP Project, Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits. This is a more applied
[02:11.440 --> 02:18.080]  project to look at spectral quality and plant shape. Big implications for supplemental lighting
[02:18.080 --> 02:24.640]  in greenhouses, big implications for indoor agriculture and vertical farming. So let's get
[02:24.640 --> 02:30.240]  started. Let's look at this. I want to acknowledge two people that in the trenches that did the work.
[02:30.880 --> 02:37.520]  Shu-Yang Chen, a postdoctoral fellow and now a research scientist in my lab, and Paul Kusuma,
[02:37.520 --> 02:44.240]  a PhD candidate. He came from the University of Florida. The work I'm showing you is largely done
[02:44.240 --> 02:52.960]  by these two young scientists. So we talk about what things affect plant growth, and we talk about
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.800]  nine cardinal parameters. And here they are. Temperature, humidity, roots-on temperature,
[02:58.800 --> 03:06.000]  nutrients, oxygen, wind, CO2, and light. The parameter right here on the top. Most of the time
[03:06.000 --> 03:15.040]  we're working to optimize these to use the given light that we have. And for generations we haven't
[03:15.040 --> 03:23.040]  been able to change the light. We just optimize what we get from the sun. Now that we can change
[03:23.040 --> 03:32.160]  the light, boom. This is a huge parameter. This we change, and then we re-optimize everything depending
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.600]  on the light. Think about it. When you increase the light, it increases the flux of water through
[03:37.600 --> 03:44.240]  the plant, and that automatically changes everything. Changes the nutrient solution ratio.
[03:44.240 --> 03:50.480]  That makes more respiration and need more oxygen. They need a lot more water. It means that CO2
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.160]  becomes cost-effective to elevate. Temperature and humidity are higher, so we need more wind.
[03:56.160 --> 04:06.560]  Changes everything. So light's a big deal. This slide summarizes something like 30 years of
[04:06.560 --> 04:14.960]  photobiology for me, personally. We have four categories of light in this. Blue photons
[04:15.760 --> 04:24.960]  inhibit cell expansion. Now that sounds terrible, but if it's stem elongation, blue photons are
[04:24.960 --> 04:32.640]  terrific. They keep plants shorter. There's some variability among plants, but this inhibition of
[04:32.640 --> 04:41.040]  stem elongation means shorter plants, and that's a huge factor. It also means reduced leaf expansion,
[04:41.040 --> 04:48.480]  which is bad. Here's an example of blue photons. This is 5% blue right here.
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.400]  Let's go back to pen. There we go.
[04:55.600 --> 05:02.080]  This is 5% blue right here. Look at how tall that is, and we increase the blue to 20,
[05:02.880 --> 05:09.520]  and the height of the plant decreased. So there's the power of blue photons. Those two plants,
[05:09.520 --> 05:15.440]  by the way, are young cannabis plants. They're medical hemp. We're one of the few universities
[05:16.160 --> 05:23.840]  in the United States with the license to study medical hemp. So we're doing research on hemp along
[05:23.840 --> 05:33.040]  with many, many food crops. Green photons facilitate human vision. They're primarily important so we
[05:33.040 --> 05:41.280]  can diagnose subtle nutritional disorders, insects, and disease. There's an old Chinese phrase that
[05:42.240 --> 05:49.360]  says, the best fertilizer is the footsteps of the farmer. And green photons are like fertilizer
[05:49.360 --> 05:55.920]  because we can see the plants and diagnose problems. In the early days of LEDs, there was
[05:55.920 --> 06:03.520]  a misperception that green photons were not used efficiently, and we made LEDs with blue and red
[06:03.520 --> 06:10.080]  photons, and that led to lots of problems. We have purple plants. You couldn't see them. Fortunately,
[06:10.080 --> 06:16.720]  those types of LEDs are diminishing. We're putting a lot more white LEDs in our fixtures
[06:17.280 --> 06:23.920]  to get the green photons so we can see the plants. Red photons are terrific. They're efficient
[06:23.920 --> 06:31.120]  photosynthesis. They're efficient LEDs. They're like the potatoes of the diet. We want a lot of
[06:31.120 --> 06:37.360]  red photons to drive photosynthesis. Even though all of these drive photosynthesis, red photons are
[06:38.240 --> 06:44.640]  better. They're about 15% better than blue photons for photosynthesis. And finally,
[06:46.080 --> 06:55.520]  new kid on the block. Far-red photons enhance cell division so they counteract the blue
[06:57.280 --> 07:02.240]  in the same way that blue photons make them shorter. We can bring in the reds to make them
[07:02.240 --> 07:10.240]  tall again. So the middle categories here, green and red, are doing their job. They're the
[07:10.240 --> 07:18.640]  background light. The biologically active colors are blues and far-reds because we can shrink and
[07:19.840 --> 07:28.240]  swell stems in this business. Let's take a look at green photons. You can see here's green lettuce
[07:28.240 --> 07:39.120]  under blue LEDs. It looks purple. And everybody's seen graphs like this. These are not really,
[07:39.120 --> 07:45.040]  these are magenta colored LEDs, but very hard to see the plants in those. All right, let's take a
[07:45.040 --> 07:53.520]  closer look at all of these now. Here's far-red. Now this is a little bit of a small picture,
[07:53.520 --> 08:00.000]  but this is white light. And we added, in this study, Paul Kusuma added 10% of the photons as
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.400]  far-red. They're like magic to lettuce. They dramatically improve cell expansion, and we got
[08:06.400 --> 08:12.480]  a much bigger lettuce plant. So for lettuce production, far-red is a very powerful color of
[08:12.480 --> 08:19.280]  light. Unfortunately, it stops with lettuce. Most other species, we add far-red and we get tall
[08:19.280 --> 08:26.800]  plants. And that's unfortunate, but that's the nature of far-red. But it's still a powerful tool
[08:26.800 --> 08:31.360]  to manipulate plant growth. So there's a summary of these colors of light.
[08:32.720 --> 08:41.840]  Now let's take a look at how much they penetrate leaves. Blue is absorbed heavily by chlorophyll A
[08:41.840 --> 08:49.040]  and B. So here's a leaf right here, the top and bottom of a leaf, and it's absorbed in the top
[08:49.040 --> 08:54.960]  layer. Compare that to green. Look at green. It penetrates the leaf all the way to the bottom,
[08:54.960 --> 09:00.960]  lights up the sponge you managed to fill. It's terrific for its penetrating power.
[09:01.760 --> 09:10.080]  Red is just like blue, absorbed in the very top layer of the leaf. It doesn't penetrate
[09:10.080 --> 09:16.560]  nearly as well as green. And finally, far-red penetrates even better than green. It goes deep
[09:16.560 --> 09:23.120]  into the leaf, and that's a good thing for the cases of leaf. So this is from this paper
[09:23.120 --> 09:29.680]  right here, Brodersen and Vogelman. It's a beautiful paper, these nice images. I added the far-red.
[09:29.680 --> 09:36.240]  They didn't study far-red, but these are nice side views of a leaf with penetration of light.
[09:37.120 --> 09:44.000]  Let's look at efficiency of LEDs. Here's our primary colors that we get. If we do efficiency,
[09:44.000 --> 09:52.960]  which is watts of photosynthetic photons out per watt of electric energy in, that's efficiency
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.720]  because the units in the numerator and the denominator are exactly the same.
[09:59.680 --> 10:07.840]  Wow! Blue chips, not fixtures yet, just the chips, 88% efficient. That's incredible how far blues
[10:07.840 --> 10:18.480]  have come. White LEDs are a phosphor-converted blue, and we can get pretty good phosphors, but
[10:18.480 --> 10:27.440]  white is a little bit less than the blues, 80%. And then the reds and the far-reds are slightly less
[10:28.160 --> 10:36.880]  efficient. So this is efficiency, but we know that watts of energy doesn't cause photosynthesis.
[10:37.680 --> 10:49.200]  Photons cause photosynthesis. So this column is micromoles of photons per joule of energy.
[10:50.080 --> 10:56.880]  And these are the peak numbers we get out. These are staggeringly high. Most high-pressure sodium
[10:56.880 --> 11:04.160]  on this comes in at about, I'm going to put it down here, high-pressure sodium comes in at
[11:05.120 --> 11:11.440]  1.7, maybe 1.8. LEDs are
[11:14.400 --> 11:21.360]  approaching twice the efficiency. LED chips, not the fixtures yet. Let's review this a second,
[11:21.360 --> 11:31.920]  because this is very confusing to people. What this is, is micromoles of photons per second
[11:32.880 --> 11:43.200]  divided by joules of electricity per second. And you can see how this simplifies to micromoles per
[11:43.200 --> 11:53.600]  joule. A joule per second is a watt, so we can say micromoles per second per watt. That's the
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.960]  same thing here. But the key here is that the numerator is moles of photons, the denominator
[12:00.960 --> 12:09.600]  is electric energy or electric power. This is power to power. Now this is good news for the
[12:09.600 --> 12:15.280]  future because eventually these LEDs make their way into fixtures and we can do great things with
[12:15.280 --> 12:21.440]  them. We have one more column. What's in that third column? How about the price of these? What's it
[12:21.440 --> 12:27.840]  cost to buy these? The cool whites are mass-produced because of human lighting in large quantities, so
[12:27.840 --> 12:35.600]  their prices drop significantly compared to these other colors. Here's the relative price. 1x for
[12:35.600 --> 12:44.880]  white LEDs, 10x for the reds, and the blues and the far reds are still 30x. This is not an inherent
[12:44.880 --> 12:50.800]  problem, it's just economy of scale. As we make more and more and more of these, by the
[12:52.640 --> 12:58.960]  millions, these prices will keep coming down and LEDs will get more cost-effective.
[12:59.280 --> 13:07.360]  Let's look at a few spectral effects. These are cannabis plants, close to harvest. We did a study
[13:07.360 --> 13:16.880]  with blue fraction on cannabis. This is 4%. Now for those of you that know blue fractions,
[13:16.880 --> 13:27.280]  this was high pressure sodium lights. These are LEDs, all of these, they're all white LEDs.
[13:27.280 --> 13:35.040]  They're all white LEDs with different fractions of blue and we ramped it all the way from 4%
[13:35.760 --> 13:42.480]  all the way up to 20%. Now in this case, there was no difference on height because we grew
[13:42.480 --> 13:47.280]  them vegetatively in the same environment and moved them into this at flowering.
[13:47.360 --> 13:58.240]  What about yield? Here's the flower yield. No difference. It looks like there's a trend and
[13:58.240 --> 14:04.080]  then it goes back down. Look at the standard deviations. There is no difference in yield
[14:04.080 --> 14:12.480]  at all among these treatments, indicating that the photosynthesis was similar in all these
[14:12.480 --> 14:21.360]  treatments and the partitioning to flowers was similar. This is an amazing slide because there
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.760]  is a lot of people that really feel that colors of light are just magic to cannabis yield. You
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.640]  need just the right colors. This doesn't prove there'll never be a difference. It's just in this
[14:34.640 --> 14:40.880]  carefully done study where all the plants were in one big room and had the same air, the same
[14:40.880 --> 14:49.600]  humidity, the same CO2. We didn't see a difference in yield. What about the cannabinoids in the plants?
[14:49.600 --> 14:56.320]  Surely this bust of blue must have done something. The next slide is cannabinoids. Here's the flowers
[14:56.320 --> 15:05.440]  at harvest. Same thing, 4% to 20%. These were medical hemp so they have mostly CBD
[15:05.600 --> 15:14.720]  but some THC. Look at the THC, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6. Exactly the same. There was no effect of
[15:15.360 --> 15:22.240]  colors of light and ratios of colors and especially blue on THC production and there was no effect on
[15:23.760 --> 15:31.760]  CBD either. So the choice of lamp for lighting cannabis should be based on the economics of the
[15:31.840 --> 15:40.480]  lights, not on the proposed hypothesized differences in cannabinoid synthesis and
[15:40.480 --> 15:46.640]  yield of the flowers, at least according to this study. We're replicating this study now but it's a
[15:46.640 --> 15:54.640]  significant finding for this. And I'm still not recommending any particular lights. I'm just saying
[15:54.640 --> 16:02.720]  the LEDs were no better than the HBS. They were no worse than HBS. However, if we did yield per
[16:02.720 --> 16:09.440]  kilowatt hour, these LEDs would win. They're more efficient than the high-pressure sodium
[16:09.440 --> 16:16.560]  because the light intensity, the photosynthetic photon flux, was kept exactly equal in this study
[16:17.120 --> 16:23.760]  and it took more energy to make the photons for high-pressure sodium. In this treatment,
[16:24.240 --> 16:30.480]  I'll draw it right here. Here's a high-pressure sodium lamp. That has a lot of thermal radiation.
[16:30.480 --> 16:36.560]  It's concentrated, a thousand watts in a small area. So to make the thermal radiation the same,
[16:37.200 --> 16:45.440]  we put a piece of tempered glass below the light and that blocked even more of the light but it
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.080]  made the thermal radiation more similar among these treatments because we didn't want to get
[16:50.640 --> 16:53.120]  differences in this treatment by thermal radiation.
[16:55.600 --> 17:04.320]  We're also studying the edges of photosynthetic radiation and these are a couple final slides on
[17:04.320 --> 17:13.440]  that. Here's our classic curve. This is 400 to 700, which we always say is photosynthetic radiation.
[17:14.160 --> 17:23.760]  This in here is, we call it PAR, photosynthetic radiation, and more precisely PPFD. Now look at
[17:23.760 --> 17:32.880]  that sharp cutoff right at 700. Really? A photon at 699 is valuable and one at 700 is not. We know
[17:32.880 --> 17:40.640]  it's not sharp. We've just approximated it for years because it tilts like this. But we now have
[17:40.640 --> 17:51.200]  a very efficient far-red LED and it peaks at 730. It looks like this. We have studied that LED for
[17:51.200 --> 18:00.080]  far-red and those photons are photosynthetically active. So we need to rethink our definition of
[18:00.080 --> 18:06.800]  photosynthesis with this in mind. They're not directly photosynthetic. They're synergistic
[18:06.800 --> 18:13.440]  with these shorter wavelengths in here and when they're coupled together, they're synergistic.
[18:14.400 --> 18:22.320]  This was discovered in the 1950s by Emerson and it's called the Emerson Enhancement Effect. But
[18:22.320 --> 18:28.320]  it sat there for half a century and we didn't study it until now that we have far-red LEDs.
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.200]  We're taking a close look at the value of far-red. On the other end of the spectrum,
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.760]  UV photons. Is this a sharp cutoff? How well are these UV photons used?
[18:40.320 --> 18:49.600]  The next two slides show some of our work on UV photons. Here's why those edges are so important.
[18:50.480 --> 18:59.520]  When we look at the photon flux of these colors, we have a violet LED that peaks right at 400.
[18:59.520 --> 19:07.040]  Can we effectively use that for photosynthesis and get a lot of the value of UV blue LEDs?
[19:07.600 --> 19:15.280]  And here's the one at 730. Here's 700 right there. That's the 730 LED. Can we use that one?
[19:15.280 --> 19:20.720]  Turns out we can for photosynthesis. What about this one? And what about wavelengths in here?
[19:21.680 --> 19:28.640]  You often see pictures of LEDs showing the energy flux and an energy basis. These are lower than
[19:28.640 --> 19:34.720]  these. The most efficient is blue, but that's not what drives photosynthesis. It's photon flux.
[19:34.720 --> 19:42.000]  When we graph the same data by photons, the reds and the blues are virtually identical. It's a
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.400]  tremendous thing. This is from a paper that we recently got published in the journal Nature,
[19:48.400 --> 19:57.680]  LEDs for Photons, Physiology, and Food. And it analyzes in this paper the economics of LEDs.
[19:59.600 --> 20:07.120]  This is the very famous McCree curve. Here's a picture of Keith McCree as a young scientist.
[20:07.120 --> 20:12.720]  He died just a few years ago. He had a long and distinguished career. He was a physicist that came
[20:12.720 --> 20:21.600]  across the biology. He said, oh my, these biologists need help. And he brought an excellent physics
[20:21.600 --> 20:27.440]  background with him. This is his curve, how the colors of light cause photosynthesis. It's
[20:27.920 --> 20:34.720]  called the McCree curve now. And he said, let's call it good. We'll cut this off at 400 and 700.
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.880]  But our data indicates that this curve should shift over here some, like this. It doesn't.
[20:42.240 --> 20:49.200]  Because of the synergism of far-red, it shifts that curve. This curve also tilts,
[20:49.920 --> 20:57.760]  and these photons just below 400 are pretty good. But when you carefully read McCree's papers,
[20:59.120 --> 21:09.680]  there's 700, there's 400. You see this graph. Now this graph, this is exactly the same as this.
[21:09.680 --> 21:18.480]  It's just graphed a little bit differently. These, and here's 400 and 700. These bars right here,
[21:19.920 --> 21:29.440]  were the range of species from his paper. My students and I made this graph from his data.
[21:30.480 --> 21:39.440]  There was very little variability among species in his data. But what people forget is that he also,
[21:39.440 --> 21:45.120]  in addition to taking plants from the field, he took plants from a growth chamber. He grew them
[21:45.120 --> 21:53.040]  in a growth chamber. Look at the difference. Some of these photons right here are almost as good as
[21:53.040 --> 22:02.000]  red, and they're close to UV photons. There was an enormous range of variability among species
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.160]  in McCree's trial. So we're re-examining this part of the curve right now, particularly with
[22:08.160 --> 22:17.120]  violet LEDs, which are just right here on the edge. Our hypothesis is that the field-grown plants
[22:17.920 --> 22:24.480]  synthesized compounds to block UV, to protect themselves. And once they synthesized those,
[22:24.480 --> 22:30.240]  the UV photons were not effective in photosynthesis. Those compounds are made in the cuticle.
[22:31.040 --> 22:36.400]  But the growth chamber plants that didn't see UV didn't make the compounds, and now the UV photons
[22:36.400 --> 22:43.520]  are valuable. So this is a cutting edge of the research we're doing on photobiology.
[22:44.160 --> 22:52.480]  And I'm going to stop here, and I will pick this up in another video. Thanks for listening.
