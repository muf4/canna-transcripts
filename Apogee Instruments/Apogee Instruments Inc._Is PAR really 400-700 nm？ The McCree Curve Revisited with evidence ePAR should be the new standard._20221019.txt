[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments and also professor of crop physiology at Utah State University.
[00:10.000 --> 00:21.000]  And in this talk today, I want to talk about modifications to our fundamental understanding of photosynthetic radiation.
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.000]  And I especially want to talk about the two edges of the cutoffs at 400 and at 700.
[00:28.000 --> 00:41.000]  Now this talk is a modified version of an address I gave two weeks ago at a controlled environments conference in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  It was a big conference and I was asked to talk about this in an invited talk, but that talk wasn't recorded.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  So now we're going to record it for you.
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  I love starting this off with the dark side of the moon. The prism divides up the colors and we analyze them.
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  And now we have LEDs as a very powerful tool to study these effects, photobiology.
[01:07.000 --> 01:16.000]  And we did used to use prisms a long time ago. So it's a really amazing change, the tools we have to study this.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  And of course, not only are they great tools for fundamental research, but they're great tools for growing crops too.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  So we're simultaneously doing work on them and studying their commercial effects.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  So to start with this, I want to start with sunlight and look at the ratios of color in sunlight.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  I want to make the point that there's not a lot of photons down around 400.
[01:42.000 --> 01:51.000]  So the cutoff down here is less critical than the cutoff at 700 because there's a lot of photons at 700.
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  So let's take a look at sunlight. Here's a classic curve of sunlight worldwide close to solar noon.
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  This changes just subtly with time of year and time of day. It changes a little, but not a lot.
[02:06.000 --> 02:15.000]  Look at this. 3%. Let me turn on my pen here and we can highlight some of this.
[02:15.000 --> 02:25.000]  There's only 3% of the photons right in here. The sunlight, because of atmospheric filtering, drops a lot right at 400.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  So even if we change the definition down here, in sunlight this is a small effect.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  But we still want to look at this because it's important for LEDs as well as studies in sunlight.
[02:38.000 --> 02:47.000]  But look at over here. 18%. This cutoff makes a big difference for our measurements of photosynthetic radiation.
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  Let's take a look at this for LEDs, which is why we're so keenly interested in this.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  If all we ever did was measure photosynthesis in sunlight, we wouldn't be so concerned about this.
[03:01.000 --> 03:12.000]  But look at our collection of LEDs. This was a beautiful slide showing the peak wavelengths, the classic things.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  There's not efficient green, they're in the middle. But look at right here.
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  There's some very efficient violet LEDs right near the cutoff. And the same thing up here.
[03:23.000 --> 03:33.000]  We have a very efficient far-red LED and they are being used in light fixtures to manipulate plant shape.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  So we really need to know if these photons are also photosynthetic.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  There's the violet, there's the far-red. And because these are being used, we want to know.
[03:45.000 --> 03:55.000]  This graph was made by Paul Kusuma, who got his PhD with me in 2021. Last year he graduated.
[03:55.000 --> 04:04.000]  He's now at Wageningen University. So we've had a long relationship with Wageningen, sharing talent back and forth.
[04:04.000 --> 04:12.000]  And we've worked closely with Leo Marcellus there. It's been a great relationship.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  So what I want to do now is, oh, first, let me emphasize two papers that Paul Kusuma wrote.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  These are not on the cutoffs, but they're on LEDs. And if you want to get state-of-the-art where LEDs are now and where they can go,
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  search for Kusuma and Bugbee and you'll see our referee journal articles come up.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  This one's called From Physics to Fixtures to Food, Current and Potential Efficacy.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Where are they going to go in the next five or ten years?
[04:43.000 --> 04:52.000]  And also, Photon Efficacy in Horticulture is a real detailed analysis of all the colors.
[04:52.000 --> 05:01.000]  So let's take a look at what we know about, first, the short wavelengths here, the efficacy.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  There's the part we're going to zoom in now on the next graph.
[05:06.000 --> 05:15.000]  Now we've got 250 to 500. And here's our classic blue LED. That's very widely used.
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  This is a very efficient LED. It's used as the base phosphor for white LEDs.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  But we also have a series of LEDs right close to 400 nanometers.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  And it's real critical to know how efficient these are.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  They're being used in fixtures because they can have significant morphological effects on plants,
[05:39.000 --> 05:46.000]  triggering secondary metabolism. But do these photons cause photosynthesis?
[05:46.000 --> 05:57.000]  So to look at this, I want to go back and look at the historical studies on quantum yield from photosynthesis.
[05:58.000 --> 06:05.000]  This is from a paper I published five years ago, 2017. It's a book chapter.
[06:05.000 --> 06:15.000]  But here's the very famous McCree curve that hundreds, more than hundreds, thousands of people cite this paper from 1971.
[06:15.000 --> 06:22.000]  But he wasn't the first to do this. A scientist named Hoover did it in 1937.
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  Imagine the technology he had. That's 90 years ago to do this.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  But they got similar curves, not identical but similar.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  And then a Japanese scientist, Inada, repeated this in 1976.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  At first glance, these are similar, but look at the area right here.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  McCree shows a big taper. Hoover shows a sharp cutoff.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  Inada shows a relatively sharp cutoff right down here in the UV.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  You can ask, why do we cite McCree's paper so much when there's other literature on this?
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  It is because his paper is exceptionally well written.
[07:03.000 --> 07:10.000]  And it's a series of two papers. And they're very comprehensive papers.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  It's a great example to graduate students to read how clear his writing is in these papers.
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  Here's Keith McCree. As a young scientist, I had the opportunity to spend time with him.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  He came to Utah State University to give us a seminar, and he spent an afternoon in my lab.
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.000]  It was a great thing to know him. He died in 2014.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  So let's take a look at his studies right here on UV light.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  I'm going to blow this up.
[07:43.000 --> 07:51.000]  What McCree found was there was a large species variability in response to these UV photons.
[07:51.000 --> 08:01.000]  He studied 21 species, and I've taken from his data the one that was the most responsive to UV
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  and the species that was least. And it turns out radishes were the most responsive.
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.000]  Sunflower was the least. And if all crops were like radish, you bet we would move the goalposts.
[08:12.000 --> 08:20.000]  We would count these photons. But if they're all like sunflower, you can start to argue we should move it the other direction.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  But crops vary a lot in how fast this drops off in the relative photosynthetic efficiency.
[08:28.000 --> 08:36.000]  Now, sunflowers and radishes are not big crops in a controlled environment, but lettuce and cucumbers are.
[08:36.000 --> 08:48.000]  Here's lettuce and cucumber. They're intermediate. They both drop quite fast right here, right close to 400 nanometers.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  This is McCree's data. Now, he had to use prisms and filters to get this data.
[08:54.000 --> 09:06.000]  It's amazing what he did, given the equipment he had. Now fast forward 50 years to where we are today with state-of-the-art LEDs.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  So we set out in my laboratory to see if we could reproduce these curves using those violet LEDs that I showed you.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  State-of-the-art gas exchange equipment, state-of-the-art LEDs. And here's what we found.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  Now, this was done by Shu-Yung Zhen, who was a very talented young scientist.
[09:28.000 --> 09:36.000]  She got her PhD. She was a postdoc with me. She's now an assistant professor at Texas A&M University.
[09:36.000 --> 09:45.000]  These are her data in my lab. Remember that radish from McCree's data was one of the best?
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  Look at that. Radish is one of the best. Remember that sunflower was one of the worst?
[09:50.000 --> 10:01.000]  We repeated McCree's data using 50 years better technology, and cucumber was in the middle, tomato was up there with radish.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  It's just quite remarkable that we were able to repeat his data.
[10:07.000 --> 10:21.000]  How about lettuce? Here's lettuce. These curves, they go down to maybe 70% at 380 nanometers.
[10:21.000 --> 10:30.000]  This is a good point here. Marshall is a purple lettuce with a lot of anthocyanin, and that does not use UV photons well at all.
[10:30.000 --> 10:44.000]  Those anthocyanins are pigments that block the UV. We think the species variability is just blocking of the UV in the cuticle, which is for protective reasons.
[10:44.000 --> 10:57.000]  The take-home message from this is these curves drop off fast, and we don't see any reason to change the definition of photosynthetic radiation
[10:57.000 --> 11:06.000]  from 400 nanometers from what we have today, unless you're doing work with some species that can use them.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  In that case, you ought to buy a spectral radiometer so you can precisely count these photons.
[11:13.000 --> 11:23.000]  Now let's move to the other end of the spectrum. Boom. Look at this effect. This is why this is such a big deal.
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.000]  This has been repeated now by scores of other scientists in laboratories.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  We know that far-red lettuce makes the lettuce leaf expansion take off.
[11:36.000 --> 11:46.000]  This is a picture of lettuce without far-red and 10% far-red. This is a big deal. Lots of literature on this.
[11:46.000 --> 11:59.000]  Here's the question. It's not controversial to say that far-red triggers a shade avoidance response and makes the plants get bigger because they think they're in shade.
[11:59.000 --> 12:10.000]  That we've known for years. We know that happens. But is all of this dramatic improvement caused by photon capture and leaf expansion,
[12:10.000 --> 12:26.000]  or is some of it caused by direct effects on photosynthesis? That finding is profound because remember, we've said since McCree,
[12:26.000 --> 12:35.000]  400 to 700 is our range, but now do these far-red photons contribute to that?
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  That is an extraordinary claim to say that we should change our fundamental definition of photosynthesis.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  Now for this extraordinary claim, we require extraordinary proof.
[12:50.000 --> 13:01.000]  And I bring in Carl Sagan, who in the series of Cosmos said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
[13:02.000 --> 13:12.000]  So what I'm now going to show you is the extraordinary proof that far-red photons cause photosynthesis in the next few slides.
[13:12.000 --> 13:23.000]  For this, we start with papers of Xu Yongzhen, who was a young PhD student with Mark Van Ersel,
[13:23.000 --> 13:32.000]  who was a distinguished professor at the University of Georgia. Many years ago, Mark Van Ersel was a postdoc with me.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  And then of course, recently, Xu Yongzhen was a postdoc. Mark got his bachelor's degree at Wageningen University
[13:39.000 --> 13:48.000]  and had opportunities in the United States and came across the ocean here, although he maintains his ties with Wageningen.
[13:49.000 --> 14:02.000]  Xu Yongzhen and Mark first published a paper in 2017. These are all very reputable, high-impact factor, reputable journals.
[14:02.000 --> 14:17.000]  Journal of Plant Physiology, and I'm not going to go into all the details, but they studied the light reactions of photosynthesis in this paper.
[14:17.000 --> 14:25.000]  And showed that the far-red photons clearly improved the light reactions of photosynthesis. We'll come back to that in a minute.
[14:25.000 --> 14:36.000]  In the second paper, a year later, Physiologica Plantarum, they used laser LEDs at specific wavelengths to show that the photons,
[14:36.000 --> 14:45.000]  at least up to 730 nanometers, were improving the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[14:45.000 --> 14:57.000]  So, after this work in Mark's lab, I recruited Xu Yongzhen to come work with me because we have a canopy gas exchange system.
[14:57.000 --> 15:07.000]  It's a very sophisticated system, but it measures photosynthesis of whole plant communities, continuously over the whole life cycle.
[15:07.000 --> 15:17.000]  There's 10 chambers. Here's a few shown here. Using this canopy gas exchange system and precise measurements of canopy photosynthesis,
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  we published a paper in Plant Cell and Environment, another high-impact journal.
[15:22.000 --> 15:32.000]  Far-red photons have equivalent efficiency to shorter wavelength photons. Implications for redefining PAR.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  This is now two years old. We kept going because we were interested in the long-term effects.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  This was short-term effects with and without far-red on canopy photosynthesis.
[15:45.000 --> 15:59.000]  So we did a study with long-term effects through the whole life cycle, and again showed these far-red photons had equivalent efficiency to the shorter wavelength photons.
[15:59.000 --> 16:11.000]  And this is in Frontiers in Plant Science. So, we have four significant journal articles now from two different laboratories showing the value of these.
[16:11.000 --> 16:25.000]  Because of this work, most colleagues have now switched to including photons up to 750 nanometers as photosynthetic when they're doing studies in controlled environments.
[16:25.000 --> 16:35.000]  It doesn't just stop with our papers because two other research groups that study this have now reported on this.
[16:35.000 --> 16:45.000]  Zhao et al., 2019, Tereshima is a well-known scientist, Plant and Cell Physiology, well-known journal. These are supporting papers.
[16:45.000 --> 16:59.000]  So the technical studies on this are providing that extraordinary proof that we need to change our understanding of far-red photons.
[16:59.000 --> 17:14.000]  So, to make a claim like this, it's not adequate to just say you have empirical evidence that this occurs.
[17:14.000 --> 17:33.000]  You need a mechanism coupled with the empirical evidence. And as I say, our understanding of how the world works requires a coupling of measurements and models and data and theory.
[17:33.000 --> 17:42.000]  So this is the theory that supports that. Without the theory, maybe 400 years ago we said the moon is made of green cheese.
[17:42.000 --> 17:52.000]  Well, that must have been because of reflected light. You know, that's a common myth. And people said, you're nuts. There's no mechanism behind that.
[17:52.000 --> 18:02.000]  And think of all the observations we have without mechanisms. That usually means the observations have something wrong about them or they're incomplete.
[18:03.000 --> 18:14.000]  But in the case of far-red photons, I go to my favorite Twin Towers diagram of how the light reactions of photosynthesis work.
[18:14.000 --> 18:26.000]  So we know from the Stark-Einstein law, our buddy with the wild hair, one photon excites one electron. That's why we count photons.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  A photon comes in. It hits the light reactions. Boom! It excites an electron. That electron cascades down in energy and it makes ATP.
[18:37.000 --> 18:44.000]  Another photon comes in. Boom! Another electron goes up and this makes NADPH.
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  This is photosystem II. This is photosystem I. Water is split here in the photosystems.
[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  But this is a really good example of the energy state of photons exciting electrons in photosynthesis.
[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  Here's the key. This guy over here can be excited with far-red photons.
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.000]  We've known that for 50 years and that is called the Emerson enhancement effect.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  These photons can excite electrons in photosystem I.
[19:21.000 --> 19:33.000]  And in fact, if you don't have any far-red photons, these two photosystems that run in a closely synchronized process can get out of balance.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  So this is the theory that underlies this.
[19:38.000 --> 19:51.000]  There's other many ways to show this, but I like this Twin Towers diagram, which I got out of a photochemistry book, to show where the photons come in.
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  So now let's take a closer look at this.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  Back to the full sunlight spectrum.
[20:00.000 --> 20:08.000]  So far, we have only shown this under electric lights, where we add far-red and we take it away.
[20:08.000 --> 20:15.000]  That's compelling evidence. But if it works under electric lights, it should also work under sunlight.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  The effect should also be present under sunlight.
[20:19.000 --> 20:30.000]  So now in the final series of studies, and this is with Xu Yongzhen, Mark Van Ersel, and myself, we undertook to make these measurements in sunlight.
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.000]  Now there's 18% photons out here, so that's what we're looking for is an 18% effect.
[20:37.000 --> 20:44.000]  To do this, we filtered the light, bought special filters that cut this off.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  There's our filter, far-red filter. It was a very nice filter. Cuts this off cleanly at 700.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  These photons are gone. This filter also cut out the UV.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  Now remember, we hypothesized that UV is not going to have a big effect. That does.
[21:03.000 --> 21:10.000]  So we added measurements with a third filter that only filtered UV.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  This is blocked. Let this through.
[21:12.000 --> 21:24.000]  When we put the UV filter on leaves, and when I say we, that means Xu Yong did the work making the measurements in the trenches, less than 1%.
[21:24.000 --> 21:33.000]  So these photons, as predicted, blocking them had a very small effect on photosynthesis.
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.000]  That's part of the reason we say 400 cut off at the bottom is a good cutoff.
[21:39.000 --> 21:45.000]  We see no reason to change that. But what happened up here with the far-red filter?
[21:45.000 --> 21:53.000]  P-net decreased 12%. Now remember, there's 18% photons up here.
[21:53.000 --> 22:00.000]  And there's a number of issues up here with how high was the light, what was saturating.
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  This number doesn't precisely match this, but that's a big decrease in photosynthesis.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  And if it's not caused by this, you got to hypothesize something else does it, and it wasn't temperature.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  We measured a number of things with this research.
[22:18.000 --> 22:27.000]  This data shows that far-red photons are important in sunlight as well as electric lights.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  But now let's look at one other case for plant ecology.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  Understory crops. When we start measuring global photosynthesis,
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  what happens to these plants down here that get filtered light?
[22:42.000 --> 22:49.000]  The far-red light is transmitted to these plants, and if we make a spectral curve of this,
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  this is filtered, this is transmitted.
[22:54.000 --> 23:05.000]  So suddenly, for these understory crops in here, wow, more than half of their photons are far-red photons.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  This has huge implications. Are we only going to count these photons in here in green?
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Are we going to count all of those photons?
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  So we made measurements of understory crops filtered by leaves.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  What did we find? Here's the filter.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  Applying that filter, we block this, let the green come through.
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  P-net decreased 40 to 60 percent.
[23:31.000 --> 23:38.000]  This is a huge effect, and it further emphasizes the value of far-red photons
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  in global climate change research, our global climate change models.
[23:43.000 --> 23:49.000]  This is a big finding, and throughout all of this work to collect these data,
[23:49.000 --> 23:58.000]  we knew it was a big finding, so we published this in a very high-impact journal called New Phytologist.
[23:58.000 --> 24:05.000]  This has an impact factor above 10. It's reserved for groundbreaking research.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  Look at the date, July 2022.
[24:08.000 --> 24:16.000]  This is a recent publication, Photosynthesis in Sun and Shade, the Surprising Importance of Far-Red Photons.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  So I refer you to this paper for the details of how we did the work.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  We got a lot of excellent reviews from some prestigious photobiologists in this,
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  and they were very appreciative of our work.
[24:30.000 --> 24:40.000]  So the collective body of evidence indicates that we need to be counting photons from 700 to 750.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  So what does this look like now? Back to the McCree curve, the classic McCree curve.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  Once again, we don't see evidence to move the goalpost here, but up on this end.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  Remember, McCree did not do synergistic effects. This was one wavelength at a time,
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  and had he done synergistic wavelengths, far-red and shorter wavelengths together,
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  the evidence is that he would have seen the same thing we did.
[25:13.000 --> 25:21.000]  These are synergistic with this, and so now the new definition adds this out here to the curve.
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  So the old metric, there's 750. The old metric was called PAR.
[25:28.000 --> 25:36.000]  The new metric we've been calling EPAR for extended PAR.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  And we're recommending people report both of these in their studies,
[25:41.000 --> 25:50.000]  but they focus on EPAR as the fundamentally best metric, and multiple other laboratories are doing exactly that.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  They're counting these photons as photosynthetic in their research.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  This has a number of implications, and I want to review those now.
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  So the move from PAR to EPAR. Number one, efficiency of fixtures.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  Are we going to count these photons in LED fixtures? And all the evidence is we should be counting them.
[26:18.000 --> 26:28.000]  ASABE does standards for this, and so far their old standard is 400 to 700 nanometers,
[26:28.000 --> 26:36.000]  but they're meeting again to revise this, and people on this committee have told us
[26:36.000 --> 26:46.000]  we need to change the standard in light of all the evidence we now have for EPAR as an improved metric over PAR.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  So this is one big implication of this.
[26:49.000 --> 27:00.000]  Second one is the Design Light Consortium rates lamps, and they're becoming a go-to standard for efficacy of LED lights.
[27:00.000 --> 27:09.000]  If they do not count far-red photons, they penalize the lighting manufacturers that add far-red to their lights.
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  So they're looking at making this change too, and they probably will have two metrics, PAR and EPAR,
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  to help people select the best lighting fixtures.
[27:21.000 --> 27:30.000]  And then finally, in portable photosynthesis systems, which we use a lot to measure photosynthesis,
[27:30.000 --> 27:42.000]  they use LEDs to light the leaves, but historically they've not had far-red LEDs in the heads of these portable photosynthesis systems.
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  So that means they get artifacts, and they underestimate true photosynthesis under sunlight,
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  and it also inhibits further studies on this because the LEDs don't include far-red, but there's one exception.
[27:58.000 --> 28:09.000]  PP Systems has now come out with a new gas exchange. It's called the Cirrus 4, and that one has far-red LEDs in the head.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  So it's continuing evidence that the world's changing to a new definition.
[28:15.000 --> 28:26.000]  Many people use a LiCor portable photosynthesis system, and we're told that LiCor is looking to add these far-red LEDs in the head of their meter as well.
[28:27.000 --> 28:37.000]  This is the end of the story, but we need to help you make these measurements, and to do that we need a new suite of sensors.
[28:37.000 --> 28:48.000]  So, Apogee Instruments came out with, first of all, they've come out with an EPAR sensor.
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.000]  Now let me draw, here's the sensor's silver, looks like this. Let me draw this on the board.
[28:56.000 --> 29:08.000]  Here is, we count the photons equally, here's 400, 700 PAR, just like the slide shows.
[29:08.000 --> 29:18.000]  This sensor goes to 750, and it's called EPAR, extended photosynthetic active radiation.
[29:19.000 --> 29:29.000]  In sunlight, this adds about 18% to the total photosynthetic radiation.
[29:29.000 --> 29:42.000]  Under electric lights, it may only add 3 or 4%, unless you're using far-red LEDs, and now that, under electric lights, it can add 18% as well.
[29:43.000 --> 29:52.000]  Because of this effect, and because we have the traditional PAR and the new EPAR,
[29:52.000 --> 30:02.000]  Apogee also made this sensor, it's a black sensor, this is hooked up to a microcache data logger.
[30:02.000 --> 30:15.000]  This sensor is called the PAR-FAR sensor, creative names for sensors, and it has two detectors in it.
[30:15.000 --> 30:26.000]  So it gives a reading for PAR, and it gives a second reading for just this radiation right here, and then of course you can add them together.
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.000]  So it gives you three numbers, this reading, that reading, and the sum of both of those.
[30:32.000 --> 30:40.000]  This is a little bit more money because it has two detectors, but it allows users to separately measure both of these.
[30:40.000 --> 30:47.000]  And then finally, lots of people want integrated meters for daily light integral.
[30:47.000 --> 31:00.000]  This is a relatively new meter that just, it has a microprocessor inside, and it gives instantaneous EPAR, and it also integrates the total of the day.
[31:00.000 --> 31:07.000]  It stores it in memory. You can get daily light integral for the past hundred days with this sensor,
[31:07.000 --> 31:14.000]  which comes in both the old PAR version and the new EPAR version.
[31:14.000 --> 31:22.000]  Of course, all of these sensors can be hooked up to data acquisition systems. They don't have to be hooked up to meters.
[31:22.000 --> 31:32.000]  This is an exciting time. Think of people in greenhouses that have mixes of supplemental light and this.
[31:32.000 --> 31:39.000]  If we don't include this, we're going to underestimate the photosynthetic radiation in greenhouses.
[31:39.000 --> 31:48.000]  So not only do we feel like there is solid empirical and theoretical evidence to change to EPAR,
[31:48.000 --> 31:55.000]  but we've also provided the sensors to facilitate making that change.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  Thanks for listening. We'll catch you again in the next video.
