[00:00.640 --> 00:07.240]  Well, hello. I am Mark van Eersel. In my daytime job, I am a professor in the
[00:07.240 --> 00:11.260]  Department of Horticulture at the University of Georgia, where I do a lot
[00:11.260 --> 00:15.360]  of research on lighting and controlled environment agriculture. Much of that
[00:15.360 --> 00:21.080]  research is funded by the USDA through a project that is called Lighting
[00:21.080 --> 00:27.800]  Approaches to Maximize Profits, in short LAMP. In addition to my job at
[00:27.800 --> 00:33.320]  the University of Georgia, I also have a company that focuses on making lighting
[00:33.320 --> 00:38.760]  control systems for controlled environment agriculture facilities, both
[00:38.760 --> 00:45.080]  greenhouses and vertical farms. And that company is called Candidas. And typically,
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.480]  I try to keep my academic and company presentations separate from each other,
[00:50.480 --> 00:54.720]  but hopefully as we go through this presentation, you will see why in this
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.280]  case it's relevant to actually combine the two into one presentation. So what I
[01:00.280 --> 01:05.040]  want to talk about today is how we can optimize lighting in controlled
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.120]  environment agriculture. And the reason that that is important is because in
[01:10.120 --> 01:14.280]  controlled environment agriculture, and again this refers to plant factories or
[01:14.280 --> 01:20.280]  vertical farms as well as greenhouses, lighting is necessary, but it also tends
[01:20.280 --> 01:26.320]  to be very expensive. And specifically, lighting typically is the second most
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.520]  expensive thing in these facilities after labor. And because of that expense,
[01:31.520 --> 01:36.120]  good control over how you provide that lighting can actually make the
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.600]  difference between being profitable versus losing money. So I'm not going to
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.280]  provide a whole lot of background. I want to jump right into what we have been
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.840]  doing from a research perspective and how we then try to apply that in the
[01:50.840 --> 01:56.200]  industry. So when we think about optimizing supplemental lighting, the
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.400]  first thing that I think about as a plant physiologist is studying how
[02:01.400 --> 02:07.160]  plants actually use light and capture that energy to drive the growth of
[02:07.160 --> 02:13.360]  plants. So if you'll indulge me, I will have just a few slides on some very
[02:13.480 --> 02:19.200]  basic plant physiology, and after that we will actually move into more applied
[02:19.200 --> 02:25.480]  things and ultimately bigger pictures of how we can actually help the industry
[02:25.480 --> 02:32.840]  save electricity costs through better light management. And so here we have a
[02:32.840 --> 02:38.520]  diagram of a membrane that we see here going along this slide that is present
[02:38.520 --> 02:45.680]  inside of the chloroplasts, inside the cells of leaves. And the basic mechanism
[02:45.680 --> 02:49.360]  that I'm going to show you here basically occurs for all plants. And this
[02:49.360 --> 02:53.640]  is where ultimately light energy is captured. It's going to get converted
[02:53.640 --> 03:00.080]  into chemical energy, which then can be used to make sugars and plant biomass. So
[03:00.080 --> 03:04.400]  the whole process starts with a photon, which in this example is going to come
[03:04.480 --> 03:10.320]  from the sun. That photon is captured and the energy from that photon is used to
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.680]  drive the movement of an electron through that membrane. With the help of a
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.800]  second photon right here, this electron ultimately moves through a compound
[03:19.800 --> 03:25.680]  called NADPH. That is an energy-rich molecule that subsequently can be used
[03:25.680 --> 03:32.640]  in the Kelvin cycle, where it is used to convert CO2 into sugar. At the same time
[03:32.640 --> 03:39.240]  as this electron moves, it also provides energy to create ATP, another energy-rich
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.960]  compound that is used to make sugars. Interestingly, and a bit of a side note,
[03:44.960 --> 03:52.200]  this photon is also used to split oxygen from a water molecule. And all of the
[03:52.200 --> 03:57.200]  oxygen that we breathe ultimately comes from this reaction right here. So these
[03:57.200 --> 04:01.880]  light reactions of photosynthesis that we see here are very important not only
[04:01.880 --> 04:08.760]  for plant growth, but also for us being able to breathe. So this is the very
[04:08.760 --> 04:14.320]  basic process that happens. And it turns out that the rate-limiting step of the
[04:14.320 --> 04:20.680]  light reactions happens right here, where photosystem II donates an electron to
[04:20.680 --> 04:26.160]  what is called the Plaster-Quinone pool. And if we can understand the efficiency
[04:26.280 --> 04:33.680]  of this process, then we can actually calculate the whole rate at which these
[04:33.680 --> 04:38.360]  light reactions occur in plants. And it turns out that this is actually
[04:38.360 --> 04:44.080]  surprisingly easy to measure. If we measure fluorescence that is given off
[04:44.080 --> 04:50.400]  by chlorophyll right here, we can very easily calculate the fraction of absorbed
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.400]  photons that are actually used to drive this electron transport. And that is
[04:54.480 --> 05:01.080]  called the quantum yield of photosystem II. And so a former graduate student in
[05:01.080 --> 05:06.440]  my lab, Jeff Weaver, collected data on lettuce throughout an entire growing
[05:06.440 --> 05:11.720]  cycle in the greenhouse. And in this graph right here, he plotted the
[05:11.720 --> 05:17.040]  photosynthetic photon flux density on the x-axis against the quantum yield of
[05:17.040 --> 05:22.760]  photosystem II. And what we see, and this is true for all species, not just
[05:22.760 --> 05:28.800]  lettuce, is that as the photosynthetic photon flux increases, the quantum yield
[05:28.800 --> 05:34.000]  of photosystem II decreases. In other words, the more light we provide to a
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.400]  plant, the less efficiently the plants can use that light to actually drive plant
[05:40.400 --> 05:46.560]  growth. Now, if we know the efficiency with which plants are using the light
[05:46.560 --> 05:51.560]  that they get, and we know the amount of light that they receive, we can calculate
[05:51.560 --> 05:56.640]  another really important parameter, the rate of electron transport through the
[05:56.640 --> 06:01.360]  light reactions of photosynthesis. And that is shown right here. Again, we have
[06:01.360 --> 06:06.200]  the photosynthetic photon flux density on the x-axis, the electron transport rate
[06:06.200 --> 06:15.200]  on the y-axis. And we see that electron transport increases asymptotically with
[06:15.320 --> 06:23.280]  increasing light levels. And it reaches a maximum here at some point. And so, this
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.800]  is all the basic plant physiology that I want to talk about. But the reason that
[06:27.800 --> 06:33.760]  we study this very intensely in my lab is because when we have an understanding
[06:33.760 --> 06:38.040]  of how these basic processes of plants work, we can actually start to make
[06:38.160 --> 06:46.000]  predictions about how to best manage lighting. And so, from these curves, we
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.320]  actually were able to come up with a few hypotheses. First of all, you should get
[06:52.320 --> 06:59.160]  the best light use efficiency for plants if, on a short term, you maintain the
[06:59.160 --> 07:05.800]  light level as stable as possible. That will result in more electron transport
[07:05.800 --> 07:12.200]  than fluctuating light levels that have the same average PPFD as a stable light
[07:12.200 --> 07:18.160]  level. So, short term, we want to have a constant PPFD throughout the entire day,
[07:18.160 --> 07:25.280]  as much as possible. And longer term, we want to have the same amount of light
[07:25.280 --> 07:29.400]  reaching the plants from day to day. So, the total amount of light that reaches
[07:29.400 --> 07:36.280]  plants within one day, we call the daily light integral. And so, theoretically, at
[07:36.280 --> 07:42.360]  least, having the same daily light integral from day to day, we predict that
[07:42.360 --> 07:48.080]  would result in better plant growth than having fluctuating DLI levels that
[07:48.080 --> 07:53.920]  average out to the same value. But keep in mind, as I emphasized right here, this
[07:54.080 --> 08:01.280]  theory. Theories are great for science, but they need to be validated. And so, we
[08:01.280 --> 08:06.080]  actually then followed this work up with studies where we tested both of these
[08:06.080 --> 08:12.360]  hypotheses to see how important, actually, is it, in practice, to have stable short
[08:12.360 --> 08:17.800]  and long-term light levels. So, the first study that I quickly want to talk about
[08:17.960 --> 08:24.040]  is a study that was done by a former master student in my lab, Rukaiya Buyun.
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.680]  And she did a study in a walk-in growth chamber, basically a small vertical farm,
[08:29.680 --> 08:34.240]  where she looked at short-term fluctuations in the photosynthetic
[08:34.240 --> 08:40.040]  photon flux density. Every 15 minutes, the light level would go up or down. And in
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.880]  all treatments, those light levels would actually average to a PPFD of 200
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.880]  micromoles per square meter per second. And so, here you can see a picture of a
[08:50.880 --> 08:56.120]  small part of the setup that she had. And in this red circle, you can actually see
[08:56.120 --> 09:01.360]  plants that were exposed to really wide fluctuations in PPFD. So, right now, these
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.400]  plants are in the dark. But 15 minutes later, these plants would have been
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.600]  getting a photosynthetic photon flux density of 400 micromoles per square meter
[09:10.600 --> 09:17.120]  per second, so that it averages out to 200. And all these other plants were
[09:17.120 --> 09:23.360]  getting different kinds of light fluctuations. So, Rukaiya collected lots of
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.400]  data. But right here, I just want to focus on plant growth. And let me go back real
[09:28.400 --> 09:35.560]  quick. So, I want to first explain the setup of this graph. So, on the bottom
[09:35.760 --> 09:42.640]  x-axis right here, we have the PPFD during the 15-minute period that these plants
[09:42.640 --> 09:49.040]  were exposed to low light levels. So, it goes from 0 to 200 micromoles. And at the
[09:49.040 --> 09:55.880]  top, we have an other x-axis that shows the photosynthetic photon flux density
[09:55.880 --> 10:02.040]  during the other 15-minute period. And so, that goes from 400 to 200 micromoles. So,
[10:02.080 --> 10:07.080]  once again, it all averages out to 200 micromoles per square meter per second.
[10:07.080 --> 10:12.120]  Rukaiya worked with two different lettuce cultivars, as you can see right here.
[10:12.120 --> 10:18.960]  Little gem and green salad bowl. And she measured both the dry weight of these
[10:18.960 --> 10:25.640]  plants as well as the leaf area. And so, when we look at the data, what we see is
[10:25.640 --> 10:33.480]  that as we go from left to right, and the fluctuations in light level become smaller
[10:33.480 --> 10:40.320]  and smaller, it turns out with very large fluctuations in light level, the plants
[10:40.320 --> 10:48.440]  grew very poorly. But in many of the treatments, so when we look at low light
[10:48.440 --> 10:55.960]  levels of 80 to 200 micromoles or high light levels of 320 to 200, the plants
[10:55.960 --> 11:00.680]  grew the same. And that was true for the dry mass of the plants. It also was true
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.720]  for the leaf area of the plants. So, what this study told us is actually that we
[11:05.720 --> 11:11.400]  don't have to maintain that stable PPFD for these plants to grow well and use
[11:11.400 --> 11:17.160]  light efficiently. These plants are actually perfectly capable of tolerating
[11:17.160 --> 11:24.320]  pretty wide fluctuations in PPFD. So, the most extreme treatment in which the
[11:24.320 --> 11:31.400]  plants do well was the treatment in which the PPFD fluctuated from 80 to 320
[11:31.400 --> 11:35.960]  micromoles throughout the entire growing cycle. So, those are pretty big
[11:35.960 --> 11:43.120]  fluctuations, but the plants were able to adapt to that very effectively. So, this
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.720]  basically told us that our hypothesis that we had that stable PPFD levels are
[11:47.720 --> 11:58.400]  important was wrong. T.C. Jeyalov, a PhD student in my lab, did a follow-up study
[11:58.400 --> 12:03.200]  where rather than looking at short-term fluctuations in light levels, we actually
[12:03.200 --> 12:11.640]  changed the PPFD from day to day. And this is a picture of part of the setup
[12:11.640 --> 12:17.480]  that he used in the greenhouse, as you may see right here. In each of these
[12:17.480 --> 12:23.680]  different sections, we have a quantum sensor that is measuring the amount of
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.640]  light that is reaching the plants. This is connected to a control system that
[12:28.640 --> 12:34.120]  allows us to very precisely control the light that is provided by these LED bars
[12:34.240 --> 12:41.760]  that you see right here. And we can then program in exactly what the daily light
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.440]  integral is going to be in all of these different sections. And we can have
[12:46.440 --> 12:52.640]  different lighting treatments in each section. So, in this study, T.C. worked
[12:52.640 --> 12:59.200]  with green salad bowl, and his treatments are summarized in this table. So, we had
[12:59.320 --> 13:05.040]  one day with high DLI, which was always followed by a day with low daily light
[13:05.040 --> 13:11.240]  integral. And then again, we would go back to the high DLI day. And so, there was
[13:11.240 --> 13:16.120]  one treatment in which the plants received a DLI of 15 moles per square
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.480]  meter per day every single day. So, the DLI fluctuation, which is something that
[13:21.480 --> 13:27.920]  we'll see in subsequent graphs, was zero, the same daily light integral each day.
[13:27.920 --> 13:34.800]  And then, as we go down, what we see is increasing fluctuations in the daily
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.720]  light integral with the most extreme treatment that we could realize in the
[13:38.720 --> 13:44.040]  greenhouse was a high daily light integral of 22 moles per square meter per
[13:44.040 --> 13:50.200]  day, followed by a day with a daily light integral of 8 moles per square meter per
[13:50.200 --> 13:56.720]  day. So, the fluctuation then in this case is 14 moles per square meter per
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.360]  day. So, here we have a picture of what representative plants in these different
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.920]  treatments look like. So, the numbers here in black show the DLI fluctuation. So,
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.800]  the bigger that number, the more the light change from one day to the next.
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.600]  And what you can hopefully see here already is that most of these plants
[14:17.720 --> 14:24.400]  look pretty similar with the exception of this plant right here that had the most
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.680]  extreme fluctuations in daily light integral. That plant received 22 moles one
[14:29.680 --> 14:35.840]  day, 8 moles the next day, back to 22, 8, etc. throughout the whole cropping cycle.
[14:35.840 --> 14:40.640]  But all of the other plants look very, very similar. So, TC, of course,
[14:40.640 --> 14:44.920]  quantified these responses. So, here, once again, we have a graph that shows the
[14:44.920 --> 14:50.960]  leaf area on the left and the dry weight of the plants on the right.
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.920]  And we did statistics to compare all of these different treatments to the control
[14:55.920 --> 15:03.480]  treatment with a daily light fluctuation of zero. And what we saw was that only the
[15:03.480 --> 15:09.560]  treatment with a DLI fluctuation of 14 right here, and likewise in this graph
[15:09.600 --> 15:17.360]  right here, those plants actually grew more poorly than plants that had the same
[15:17.360 --> 15:25.000]  daily light integral each day. So, this told us that lettuce can actually also
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.960]  tolerate pretty wide fluctuations in the daily light integral from day to day.
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.360]  There is a limit to how large those fluctuations can get before you get a
[15:35.360 --> 15:40.880]  meaningful reduction in growth. But we were very surprised to see that these
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.320]  plants could actually tolerate pretty substantial fluctuations in the daily
[15:45.320 --> 15:50.600]  light integral without a meaningful decrease in the growth of the plants.
[15:50.600 --> 15:56.840]  So, once again, the hypothesis that we started with was actually not correct.
[15:56.840 --> 16:02.480]  The plants turned out to be much more tolerant of fluctuating light levels,
[16:02.480 --> 16:11.080]  both short-term and long-term, than we had expected. So, that's really interesting to us.
[16:11.080 --> 16:18.120]  And it is actually pretty important because this opens up important opportunities
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.560]  related to how we control light and control the environment agriculture.
[16:22.560 --> 16:27.680]  We don't have this precise control. We don't need to have this precise control
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.320]  where we have the exact same light level throughout a day or the same light level
[16:32.320 --> 16:37.360]  from day to day. We can take advantage of the fact that these plants are able to
[16:37.360 --> 16:46.160]  tolerate changing light levels. And so, one way that that ability of plants to
[16:46.160 --> 16:50.560]  tolerate those light levels comes into play is that it allows us to take
[16:50.560 --> 16:57.320]  advantage of variable electricity prices. So, many commercial facilities don't have
[16:57.320 --> 17:03.680]  a set electricity price, that the price of electricity may depend on the overall
[17:03.680 --> 17:09.120]  demand for electricity at that particular time. So, we have an example
[17:09.120 --> 17:14.280]  here of how the electricity price for commercial facilities may change over
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.920]  the course of a day, where perhaps there is a preset schedule, as we see here, for
[17:20.920 --> 17:25.720]  small and large commercial customers, where during the middle of the day, when
[17:25.800 --> 17:30.840]  there is a lot of activity, the electricity prices may get higher.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.880]  Or, in some cases, the electricity price can change in real time, as is indicated
[17:38.880 --> 17:45.040]  here by this example of this red line. So, in that case, the price of electricity
[17:45.040 --> 17:53.200]  is responding continuously to changing electricity prices. So, if lots of people
[17:53.320 --> 17:59.160]  want electricity, as you see right here and right here, the price goes up in the
[17:59.160 --> 18:06.000]  hope to reduce overall electricity use. And so, utility companies do this
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.440]  variable pricing to try to smooth out electricity use over the course of a day.
[18:11.440 --> 18:17.640]  It helps them manage the grid if they can reduce the peak power use. So, this is a
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.360]  really big deal for utility companies. But, of course, in controlled environment
[18:22.360 --> 18:27.240]  agriculture, this is important, because if we think about variable electricity
[18:27.240 --> 18:33.600]  prices and the need for electricity to drive lighting, obviously, we would
[18:33.600 --> 18:40.400]  preferably provide supplemental lighting as much as possible during times of the
[18:40.400 --> 18:45.920]  day that the cost of electricity is low. And we would want to limit the amount of
[18:45.920 --> 18:51.480]  light that we provide or electricity that we use when that electricity is expensive.
[18:53.280 --> 18:59.520]  And so, there is a complication with trying to implement this. In the United
[18:59.520 --> 19:06.320]  States, we have about 2,200 large utility companies. There is another 3,000 small
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.960]  utility companies in the United States. And each utility company has its own
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.480]  pricing structure that may be based on real-time pricing. They may have a preset
[19:16.480 --> 19:22.640]  schedule. And on top of that, they typically have a demand charge that is
[19:22.640 --> 19:29.520]  based on the peak power use of a customer during a 15-minute window during a single
[19:29.520 --> 19:35.680]  billing cycle. So, not only does each utility company have its own pricing
[19:35.680 --> 19:42.560]  structure, what makes implementation of this in lighting control complicated is
[19:42.560 --> 19:48.200]  the fact that there is no uniform way in which these utility companies provide
[19:48.200 --> 19:54.240]  information about electricity prices to their customers. They all have different
[19:54.240 --> 20:00.480]  ways to do so. And that means that you may need to provide separate software for each
[20:00.480 --> 20:06.280]  utility company to take advantage or to be able to read in real-time electricity
[20:06.280 --> 20:12.200]  prices and then take advantage of that in lighting control systems. So, at this point,
[20:12.240 --> 20:18.000]  I think the biggest hurdle in implementing this in a commercial setting is the fact
[20:18.000 --> 20:24.360]  that we do not yet have a uniform way to get that information about electricity
[20:24.360 --> 20:30.280]  prices. So, hopefully, that will change in the future. The other thing that is, of
[20:30.280 --> 20:35.480]  course, important for controlling supplemental lighting in greenhouses are
[20:35.480 --> 20:40.000]  the weather conditions. And when I say weather, what I really mean is the amount
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.480]  of sunshine that is going to be available over the next day. Because if we know in
[20:45.480 --> 20:50.640]  advance how much sunlight we are going to get, we can take that into account as we
[20:50.640 --> 20:57.360]  develop the best strategy to provide supplemental light. So, at the University
[20:57.360 --> 21:03.000]  of Georgia, we have done some work on sunlight forecasting. We've tried multiple
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.240]  approaches, and they work really well during most of the day. But none of them
[21:09.240 --> 21:15.560]  actually work well before sunrise. And they don't work well before sunrise
[21:15.560 --> 21:21.840]  because we don't have any real-time information yet about how much sunshine
[21:21.840 --> 21:29.280]  is available. And so, that is really problematic because many greenhouses like
[21:29.280 --> 21:35.240]  to start the supplemental lighting very early in the morning, maybe 3 or 4 a.m.,
[21:35.240 --> 21:38.760]  when the neighbors are asleep and they don't really care if there is any light
[21:38.760 --> 21:45.440]  pollution. And so, it makes it difficult to provide an optimal lighting strategy
[21:45.440 --> 21:50.240]  if we don't know how much light we're going to get over the course of the day.
[21:50.240 --> 21:56.200]  So, the practical solution, I think, from a commercial perspective is going to be
[21:56.200 --> 22:03.800]  that companies that want to provide strategies for lighting control simply can
[22:03.800 --> 22:09.920]  purchase solar forecasts. So, solar forecasts are readily available and have
[22:09.920 --> 22:16.280]  largely been developed for solar energy generation so that utility companies can
[22:16.280 --> 22:24.800]  predict how much electricity can be generated through photovoltaic panels.
[22:24.800 --> 22:31.640]  And so, this is just an example of solar forecasting. Actually, the first 2.5 days
[22:31.640 --> 22:38.400]  that we see here are in the past. So, we have 2.5 days of real-world measured
[22:38.400 --> 22:43.840]  light levels, which are shown in blue here. It's called global horizontal irradiance,
[22:43.840 --> 22:51.120]  but it's just a fancy term for sunlight. And then, here we have a day and a half of
[22:51.120 --> 22:55.680]  forecasted sunlight levels. And so, that information is going to be really
[22:55.680 --> 23:04.600]  valuable to develop better lighting control algorithms. So, purchasing these
[23:04.600 --> 23:09.080]  forecasts, I think, is going to be the practical way to do this. So, at the
[23:09.080 --> 23:15.880]  University of Georgia, with the help of the team of a colleague at the university,
[23:15.880 --> 23:21.080]  Javad Mohamed Puavelmi, we have developed algorithms that can take into account the
[23:21.080 --> 23:29.040]  needs of the plant. It can take advantage of variable electricity prices. And in
[23:29.040 --> 23:34.160]  our case, we were using sunlight prediction methods. And the goal was to
[23:34.160 --> 23:42.360]  minimize the cost of electricity. The algorithm looks like this right here. I'm
[23:42.360 --> 23:46.880]  not going to go through the math right here. If you're interested in it, the
[23:46.880 --> 23:52.800]  citation is right here at the bottom. So, we implemented that lighting control
[23:52.800 --> 23:57.920]  algorithm from the previous slide in research greenhouses at the University
[23:57.920 --> 24:03.040]  of Georgia. And this is a picture of part of the setup that we had. So, we have an
[24:03.040 --> 24:08.200]  Apogee quantum sensor right here that measures the amount of sunlight that is
[24:08.200 --> 24:14.120]  coming into the greenhouse. That quantum sensor is connected to a Raspberry Pi
[24:14.160 --> 24:19.120]  microcomputer. And that Raspberry Pi microcomputer does the required
[24:19.120 --> 24:25.640]  calculations and then generates a signal through these electronics right here
[24:26.120 --> 24:31.680]  that is sent to the power supply of the LED fixture. So, we have the power supply
[24:31.680 --> 24:40.560]  right here, the light fixture right here, and lattice plants underneath it. And so,
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.840]  this Raspberry Pi was controlling the lighting throughout the entire production
[24:45.840 --> 24:51.600]  cycle. And we had three different lighting scenarios that we wanted to
[24:51.600 --> 24:56.440]  compare. One of them is what we call the baseline scenario. And that baseline
[24:56.440 --> 25:02.000]  assumes that we know in advance exactly how much sunlight we are going to have
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.840]  when. So, that results in the perfect solution. But because it requires precise
[25:08.840 --> 25:13.520]  knowledge over how much light we will get when, it is impossible to implement.
[25:13.520 --> 25:19.120]  So, this was basically a theoretical control for this study. And then we had
[25:19.120 --> 25:22.880]  our prediction-based method that takes into account the crop requirements,
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.160]  variable electricity pricing, and predicted sunlight levels. This was
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.040]  implemented and we compared that to what we call a heuristic lighting control
[25:33.120 --> 25:39.920]  method, where we make sure that we always have a minimum photosynthetic photon
[25:39.920 --> 25:44.720]  flux density for the crop by dimming the lights and respond to sunlight. It's a
[25:44.720 --> 25:50.400]  simple approach, very easy to implement, but it is certainly not optimal. That said,
[25:50.400 --> 25:55.120]  this is probably still better than what is used in many commercial greenhouses.
[25:55.120 --> 26:01.520]  So, when we look at how these three different methods perform, in this case
[26:01.520 --> 26:06.840]  during a very overcast day, what we see here is the blue line shows the amount
[26:06.840 --> 26:11.600]  of supplemental light that would be theoretically the best possible strategy
[26:11.600 --> 26:16.040]  in response to changing sunlight during the day. And the sunlight right here is
[26:16.040 --> 26:21.200]  shown with the black dashed line. The sunlight levels were extremely low this
[26:21.200 --> 26:28.440]  day. So, our prediction-based method is shown in red. And we see that it follows
[26:28.440 --> 26:33.400]  the blue line or the theoretical optimum pretty nicely with a little bit
[26:33.400 --> 26:39.400]  of divergence, maybe right after sunrise and a little bit of divergence right
[26:39.400 --> 26:45.120]  after sunset. But overall, it is very, very similar. And both of these methods
[26:45.120 --> 26:51.000]  provide a lot of day, a lot of light early in the day, because electricity is
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.600]  relatively cheap in this example. And we provide less light late in the day when
[26:55.640 --> 27:01.360]  electricity is more expensive. The heuristic method provides the same amount
[27:01.360 --> 27:07.240]  of light early in the day as late in the day, because it is not capable of taking
[27:07.240 --> 27:15.400]  advantage of changing electricity prices. When we then look at a partly sunny day,
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.640]  we have once again here in black the sunlight level. So, you can see that it
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.960]  is A, much higher than in the previous example. And B, it goes up and down quite
[27:24.960 --> 27:29.680]  a bit during the day. But what we see here, let's start with the blue line
[27:29.680 --> 27:35.160]  again that shows a theoretical optimum. The lights should be off during most of
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.440]  the day. And then a little bit of supplemental light is provided early in
[27:39.440 --> 27:46.040]  the day and once again late in the day. And we see that our prediction-based
[27:46.040 --> 27:52.160]  method does fairly well, but it provides a little bit too little light during the
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.600]  morning hours and it has to make up for that later in the day. The heuristic
[27:57.600 --> 28:04.960]  method provides quite a bit of excess light here during the morning hours and
[28:04.960 --> 28:10.960]  it also provides quite a bit of light during the later part of the day. So,
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.640]  based on these data, we could calculate the electricity use and the cost of
[28:15.640 --> 28:23.320]  electricity required to grow a crop of lettuce in a greenhouse. And so, this
[28:23.320 --> 28:28.240]  table summarizes some of that information. And so, the prices here are
[28:28.240 --> 28:32.920]  expressed in dollars per hectare. If you want to convert that to dollars per acre,
[28:32.920 --> 28:40.920]  you simply divide all of the numbers by 2.5. But so, to grow this lettuce crop in
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.800]  wintertime, it costs $160,000 in electricity. And that is the best-case
[28:47.800 --> 28:54.760]  scenario, the baseline, to provide the supplemental light required to grow that
[28:54.760 --> 29:00.280]  crop. When we compare that to how well our prediction-based method does, we see
[29:00.280 --> 29:07.760]  that that increases the cost of providing that light by $1,700 per hectare.
[29:07.760 --> 29:15.160]  That's a 1% increase in the cost of electricity. So, we got within 1% of the
[29:15.160 --> 29:19.480]  perfect solution and I would consider that to be really accurate. We were very
[29:19.480 --> 29:23.720]  pleased with that. And then, when we look at the pretty simplistic heuristic
[29:23.720 --> 29:30.000]  approach for supplemental lighting, we saw that the heuristic approach increased
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.680]  the cost by $8,800 per hectare or 5.5%. And I actually
[29:35.680 --> 29:40.360]  thought that that was not too bad either. That's still pretty accurate. But
[29:40.360 --> 29:45.080]  when we then look at what happens during late spring, when there is a lot more
[29:45.080 --> 29:49.840]  sunlight available, we see that precision lighting control, A, becomes more
[29:49.840 --> 29:54.280]  difficult and B, becomes much more important. So, when we look at the total
[29:54.280 --> 30:02.520]  cost for that lighting in an ideal scenario, that would be $95,000 per
[30:02.640 --> 30:07.000]  hectare in spring. We have to provide less supplemental light in spring than in
[30:07.000 --> 30:13.240]  winter, which is why the lighting cost has got almost in half. And then, when we
[30:13.240 --> 30:20.120]  look at the prediction-based method that we developed, our cost was $7,300 per
[30:20.120 --> 30:25.400]  hectare higher than the perfect scenario. So, we have roughly 8% higher
[30:25.400 --> 30:31.560]  electricity cost. But comparing that to the heuristic method, it increased the
[30:31.560 --> 30:38.640]  lighting cost by $60,000 per hectare compared to the perfect solution, and
[30:38.640 --> 30:44.840]  $52,000 higher than our prediction-based method. So, now we see that our
[30:44.840 --> 30:49.240]  prediction-based method starts to do much, much better than the heuristic
[30:49.240 --> 30:53.240]  method. And once again, I want to point out the heuristic method isn't all that
[30:53.240 --> 30:58.040]  bad when compared to standard lighting control approaches that are used in
[30:58.040 --> 31:04.120]  greenhouses. So, the bottom line here is that there is a lot of potential to
[31:04.120 --> 31:11.440]  reduce electricity cost by implementing smarter lighting control solutions. And
[31:11.440 --> 31:15.920]  so, our prediction-based method, I thought, worked very well. If we can get weather
[31:15.920 --> 31:21.040]  predictions, weather forecast, and incorporate those, I'm sure we can do
[31:21.040 --> 31:27.080]  better. And I want to point out that we got similar plant growth under our
[31:27.080 --> 31:32.240]  prediction-based method as compared to the heuristic lighting control method.
[31:32.240 --> 31:38.280]  But average over winter through late spring, the prediction-based method can
[31:38.280 --> 31:46.000]  reduce the electricity cost by about 35%. So, that is pretty substantial. And in
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.200]  principle, this is pretty easy to implement. We need a Raspberry Pi
[31:50.200 --> 31:56.500]  microcomputer, a quantum sensor, and some pretty simple electronics so that we can
[31:56.580 --> 32:03.820]  interface with the actual LED lights. So, we hope to do larger scale trials this
[32:03.820 --> 32:07.780]  coming winter to make sure that this still works in commercial greenhouses,
[32:07.780 --> 32:13.900]  where we would have to control much larger areas of lighting. And where we
[32:13.900 --> 32:17.700]  want to go with this in the future, and this is something that I'm really
[32:17.700 --> 32:23.020]  passionate about, is make sure that these better lighting control strategies that
[32:23.100 --> 32:27.340]  we've been working on, that they can meet the needs of the controlled environment
[32:27.340 --> 32:32.580]  agriculture industry. And of course, the main objective for them is to make sure
[32:32.580 --> 32:37.260]  that they can produce whatever crop they're growing in the most profitable
[32:37.260 --> 32:44.060]  way possible. But we also want to take into account the need of utility
[32:44.060 --> 32:49.620]  companies. And that means shifting as much electricity use as possible from
[32:49.620 --> 32:56.180]  peak hours away to times of the day that electricity use by society at large
[32:56.180 --> 33:01.700]  is relatively low. And that can reduce peak power use, it can help utility
[33:01.700 --> 33:06.820]  companies manage the grid better, and this is an issue that utility companies
[33:06.820 --> 33:11.620]  are very interested in. And ultimately, what we also need to do is meet the
[33:11.620 --> 33:17.580]  needs of society. Controlled environment agriculture can use a lot of
[33:17.700 --> 33:23.180]  electricity. Generating that electricity tends to generate greenhouse gases. And
[33:23.180 --> 33:28.500]  so what can we do to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are actually
[33:28.500 --> 33:32.540]  associated with providing all of this lighting in controlled environment
[33:32.540 --> 33:39.020]  agriculture? Hopefully, we can cut that significantly. But the question is that
[33:39.020 --> 33:45.140]  different stakeholders have different priorities. So the question then becomes,
[33:45.140 --> 33:48.980]  how do we balance these different priorities? And how do we make sure that
[33:48.980 --> 33:56.180]  everybody ultimately comes out ahead? And so this is where my company, Candidus,
[33:56.180 --> 34:01.820]  comes in. Because as a company, we are much better positioned to drive this
[34:01.820 --> 34:07.500]  innovation and make sure that it becomes available to the controlled environment
[34:07.500 --> 34:12.020]  agriculture industry so that we can implement these solutions that we develop
[34:12.140 --> 34:19.300]  at the university at scale. And so what is really exciting to me is that Candidus
[34:19.300 --> 34:24.220]  is collaborating with the National Resources Conservation Service through a
[34:24.220 --> 34:30.580]  conservation innovation grant where we are demonstrating the energy savings
[34:30.580 --> 34:36.860]  potential of advised lighting control systems. So to give you a very quick idea
[34:36.900 --> 34:42.980]  of what we do at Candidus, here we have a picture of our lighting control system.
[34:42.980 --> 34:47.620]  So we have a computer here with some additional electronic components that
[34:47.620 --> 34:52.660]  help us interface with the lighting system. We use Apogee quantum sensors to
[34:52.660 --> 34:57.900]  measure light levels. And so this is the hardware. But with that hardware, of
[34:57.900 --> 35:03.580]  course, we need software which includes a user interface. So this is a screenshot
[35:03.580 --> 35:09.940]  of what our users see and where they can set how the lights should behave. So
[35:09.940 --> 35:16.540]  they can set the photo period right here. For ornamental or cannabis growers, they
[35:16.540 --> 35:21.860]  can control the photo period. So they can make sure that they control the flowering
[35:21.860 --> 35:26.300]  of plants, whether they want them to flower or stay vegetative. They can do
[35:26.300 --> 35:30.300]  that through night interruption, turning lights on for a few hours in the middle
[35:30.300 --> 35:34.380]  of the night or through daylight expansion. And we have some unique
[35:34.380 --> 35:40.460]  capabilities where we can use existing dimmable lighting systems to provide
[35:40.460 --> 35:47.860]  this lighting at a relatively low intensity. We also have daily light
[35:47.860 --> 35:53.660]  carryover where we can take advantage of days that have a high daily light
[35:53.660 --> 35:58.460]  integral one day. We take that excess light and then we can provide a little
[35:58.540 --> 36:03.380]  bit less light the next day. This is the user interface where people see how the
[36:03.380 --> 36:07.700]  lighting system is performing. This is real-time data on light in the greenhouse.
[36:07.700 --> 36:12.820]  And the green line shows how the LEDs are responding to that. You can have a
[36:12.820 --> 36:16.580]  summary of the settings at the bottom. And this shows how much light the
[36:16.580 --> 36:23.340]  greenhouse has received. And the next step of what we will do with the NRCS is
[36:23.340 --> 36:28.420]  actually develop guidelines to develop incentive programs or rebate programs
[36:28.420 --> 36:33.340]  for controlled environment agriculture producers to help them implement these
[36:33.340 --> 36:39.580]  advanced lighting control systems in their own facilities. And it's really
[36:39.580 --> 36:43.340]  exciting to us that there are multiple utility companies that already have
[36:43.340 --> 36:47.940]  started providing rebates for better lighting control systems. For a long time
[36:47.940 --> 36:53.460]  they have provided rebates for more efficient lights, switching from HPS to
[36:53.460 --> 36:58.060]  LED. But what we see now is that they also start to provide rebates for
[36:58.100 --> 37:04.820]  better control systems. And so ultimately what this should lead to is that
[37:04.820 --> 37:08.300]  controlled environment agriculture facilities, we have a vertical farm right
[37:08.300 --> 37:13.700]  here, are fully integrated into the utility network and serve kind of as a
[37:13.700 --> 37:20.180]  buffer where we can use less electricity when everybody else needs more. And then
[37:20.180 --> 37:25.260]  we use more electricity when everybody else needs less. And so with this
[37:25.420 --> 37:30.420]  approach we can manage, well we can create a scenario where everyone
[37:30.420 --> 37:35.780]  benefits. And the only reason that this is possible is that we have an academic
[37:35.780 --> 37:41.580]  institution funding from the USDA and a commercial company that together once
[37:41.580 --> 37:45.940]  again with the USDA is focused on implementing this at scale in the
[37:45.940 --> 37:51.620]  industry. So to summarize this, we want to optimize production and
[37:51.940 --> 37:58.620]  profitability for the industry, help utilities manage their grid, and we want
[37:58.620 --> 38:02.820]  to provide benefits to society by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So
[38:02.820 --> 38:07.860]  ultimately this should result in a win-win-win scenario where everybody
[38:07.860 --> 38:14.260]  comes out ahead. And with that I would like to acknowledge the USDA for funding
[38:14.260 --> 38:20.340]  Project LAMP which does the basic research to make that happen.
