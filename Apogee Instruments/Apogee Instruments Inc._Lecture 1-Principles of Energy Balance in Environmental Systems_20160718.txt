[00:02.110 --> 00:09.070]  This is going to be different because this is a higher level class than
[00:09.070 --> 00:13.710]  beginning graduate students because most of you have already had exposure to some
[00:13.710 --> 00:20.070]  of this stuff. We'll try to solidify the basics and then go into more
[00:20.070 --> 00:27.430]  depth as we come up on things. I guess I should introduce myself like I do
[00:27.430 --> 00:38.070]  to all the students. I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is more for the video.
[00:38.070 --> 00:46.590]  My title is professor of crop physiology. Somewhere along the line I got much
[00:46.590 --> 00:53.710]  more interested in the physics of plant growth than the physiology. That
[00:53.710 --> 01:01.750]  means energy and mass transfer into and out of plants. Because of that
[01:01.750 --> 01:06.430]  my laboratory has done well with getting funding because people want to quantify
[01:06.430 --> 01:12.790]  things. Many, many years ago that led to a lot of instruments to rigorously
[01:12.790 --> 01:22.550]  quantify inputs and outputs. What I've evolved to now is instrument-intensive
[01:22.550 --> 01:29.150]  research on plant growth. Some students have called this class in the reviews
[01:29.150 --> 01:33.190]  some students have called this class crop physics. You should just call it
[01:33.190 --> 01:37.110]  crop physics because that's what it is. That's not strictly correct because
[01:37.110 --> 01:44.390]  there's a lot of biology in the class as well. What I'm going to focus on in
[01:44.390 --> 01:50.430]  approximately the next eight lectures is this outline here which I've handed out
[01:51.230 --> 01:57.150]  which focuses on energy balance. It's the first part of the class and it's the
[01:57.150 --> 02:08.950]  fundamentals by which we get evaporation from surfaces. As a point of
[02:08.950 --> 02:16.790]  introduction and before I get way too far into this, I thought I would give you
[02:16.790 --> 02:25.830]  a full copy of the whole class that I teach. You can see we're pruning off
[02:25.830 --> 02:32.350]  these early lectures right here. I teach this winter semesters up here but we're
[02:32.350 --> 02:37.030]  pruning off this first section up here on energy balance. This is the
[02:37.030 --> 02:47.830]  whole thing. This is also the front page of the textbook I use which is a
[02:47.830 --> 02:55.390]  bunch of readings of this. I love to put all the key equations right on the
[02:55.390 --> 03:00.070]  front of the book so people can see those and see what's coming up.
[03:00.910 --> 03:06.710]  Mostly the top half of these things are the ones we're going to focus on in here.
[03:06.710 --> 03:22.710]  The reason we do energy balance analysis in any field is to
[03:22.710 --> 03:31.030]  try and determine the temperature of objects. Anytime water is involved now
[03:31.030 --> 03:35.430]  it gets way more complicated because water evaporates and changes the
[03:35.430 --> 03:41.510]  temperature of objects, which is why agriculture focuses on energy
[03:41.510 --> 03:50.190]  balance so much. If we could get a low-cost sensor that could measure the
[03:50.190 --> 03:55.670]  evaporation of water from a field it would be a huge breakthrough. Just put it
[03:55.670 --> 04:01.350]  out there and measure the flux of water but there isn't any low-cost ways to do
[04:01.350 --> 04:06.150]  that. We do it with modeling and lots of modeling. We measure all the
[04:06.150 --> 04:10.870]  parameters around this and what's left is this missing water and this much
[04:10.870 --> 04:16.470]  water must have evaporated to balance the energy. That's the most
[04:16.470 --> 04:20.790]  cost-effective way to do it and frankly that's a big reason instrument
[04:20.790 --> 04:24.830]  companies are in business because they sell instruments to measure everything.
[04:24.830 --> 04:32.710]  We can put plants on a lysimeter and weigh them and that's an accurate way to
[04:32.710 --> 04:39.150]  get water that evaporates. Lysimeters are really expensive to install.
[04:39.150 --> 04:46.430]  They're expensive to operate and only people that use those as references use
[04:46.430 --> 04:51.430]  lysimeters. The rest of us use calculations and modeling. We use
[04:51.430 --> 04:58.550]  lysimeters as well but only for reference instruments. We can do things
[04:58.550 --> 05:02.830]  like eddy covariance to get water transfer and that's still that's
[05:02.830 --> 05:09.150]  expensive and requires knowledgeable people. That's still an indirect
[05:09.150 --> 05:14.070]  measurement of measuring water vapor. We keep coming back to energy balance
[05:14.070 --> 05:23.470]  principles to really understand where the water is going. If you type
[05:23.470 --> 05:28.830]  in water use in the world on the internet you get lots of things like
[05:28.830 --> 05:38.710]  this. Agriculture is 70% of our water in the United States and worldwide.
[05:38.710 --> 05:44.870]  It's the massive user of water. I gave a TED talk on this a few years ago,
[05:44.870 --> 05:50.110]  turning water into food. The main point in that talk was people aren't
[05:50.110 --> 05:55.270]  wasting water. The image is if farmers are using 70% of our water they must be
[05:55.270 --> 06:00.510]  just wasting it, running it down into rivers and into the groundwater. It just
[06:00.510 --> 06:08.990]  takes that much water to grow food. This is one of many graphs of that.
[06:08.990 --> 06:15.070]  The point is if we could improve water use efficiency in agriculture by 1%
[06:15.070 --> 06:21.070]  it would be more than what you use at home.
[06:21.070 --> 06:26.150]  Forget putting bricks in your toilet and turning the water off
[06:26.150 --> 06:30.270]  when you brush your teeth. Those are just minuscule compared to the amount of
[06:30.270 --> 06:34.390]  water that it takes to grow our food, which is why it's so imperative to
[06:34.390 --> 06:39.470]  understand that and use every drop as efficiently as we can. We call that more
[06:39.470 --> 06:45.230]  crop per drop, that effort. It takes a lot of instruments to get that
[06:45.230 --> 06:52.790]  analyzed and it takes a lot of rigorous and careful theoretical development to
[06:52.790 --> 07:04.230]  make sure we've got it right because so many cases are different. People need
[07:04.230 --> 07:10.350]  oxygen to run our respiration and you think what's a person's water use
[07:10.350 --> 07:15.390]  efficiency? What's our personal water use efficiency? You calculate how much
[07:15.390 --> 07:21.430]  water do we exhale and how much food we eat. It's the reverse of plants. People
[07:21.550 --> 07:29.430]  have it easy because there's 21% oxygen in the air and we don't have to breathe
[07:29.430 --> 07:38.190]  very much and therefore we don't lose much water. Plants have to work on 0.04%
[07:38.190 --> 07:46.270]  CO2 in the air. For plants to breathe they got to have their stomates wide
[07:46.270 --> 07:54.910]  open and the water diffuses out into the world. I could start this by writing
[07:54.910 --> 08:01.150]  what I think is the most important equation in the world. You ask people
[08:01.150 --> 08:08.310]  what that is and maybe it's E equals mc squared. To me the most
[08:08.310 --> 08:24.330]  important equation in the world is photosynthesis. There are subscripts on
[08:24.330 --> 08:31.930]  these C6H12 but this is the basic, the simple stoichiometry. The plants in
[08:31.930 --> 08:37.730]  photosynthesis are taking this low energy gas that we use to put out fires
[08:37.730 --> 08:44.730]  and turning it into carbohydrate, a high-energy solid. It's just amazing that
[08:44.810 --> 08:56.010]  they do that. Again, if this is 20.95% the oxygen and this is 0.04%
[08:56.010 --> 09:02.170]  the CO2. Not only are they taking a low-energy gas but it's a trace gas.
[09:02.170 --> 09:09.450]  It's minuscule. I've said if you took the molecules in here and turned them
[09:09.450 --> 09:14.370]  colors and the nitrogen in the air, if that was say black and the
[09:14.370 --> 09:19.610]  oxygen was red. Now try and see the CO2 molecules. You probably wouldn't even be able to see them.
[09:19.610 --> 09:25.250]  They're such a trace gas. This is four out of every 10,000 molecules is CO2.
[09:25.250 --> 09:29.810]  That's what the plants are having to work with. They got to keep their
[09:29.810 --> 09:37.450]  stomates wide open to get that CO2. People can breathe without having to
[09:37.450 --> 09:43.250]  exhale much water vapor because there's plenty of oxygen. As my friend and
[09:43.250 --> 09:46.730]  colleague Rick Allen says, it's a good thing plants don't have to go anywhere
[09:46.730 --> 09:49.810]  because as soon as they start to move they get out of breath.
[09:49.810 --> 09:54.330]  There's not enough oxygen. Of course this is going the other way.
[09:54.330 --> 10:01.010]  Here's photosynthesis. Here's respiration. This low gas is really the
[10:01.010 --> 10:05.770]  fundamental reason we have to give so much water to plants so they
[10:05.770 --> 10:11.130]  can make our food. That puts it in perspective of the stakes in this thing.
[10:11.130 --> 10:19.410]  Trying to optimize every drop of that massive amount of water. That's why
[10:19.410 --> 10:24.650]  I was honored to be able to give a TED talk and talk about this issue of where
[10:24.650 --> 10:32.850]  all the water is going in agriculture. I think to start this I'm going to start
[10:32.850 --> 10:46.490]  with another important equation. The energy balance equation.
[10:46.490 --> 10:53.970]  I think I said in the outline the multiple components of this.
[10:53.970 --> 11:02.330]  Let's leave that up here for a minute. Let's even start before that.
[11:02.330 --> 11:14.370]  First law of thermodynamics. Energy E in equals E out. I'm going to erase this top
[11:14.370 --> 11:19.210]  part here for a minute because these are different principles.
[11:19.210 --> 11:26.250]  This is easily the most widely known and to me by far the most
[11:26.250 --> 11:32.370]  profound of the laws of thermodynamics. There's really three laws of
[11:32.370 --> 11:38.770]  thermodynamics. Energy has to balance. The second one is the world tends to more
[11:38.770 --> 11:43.530]  entropy, meaning more randomness in the world. The planets are
[11:43.530 --> 11:52.890]  moving apart and the world's becoming lower, more random, lower energy.
[11:52.890 --> 11:59.810]  The third one has to do with absolute zero. As you get closer to absolute zero
[11:59.810 --> 12:05.530]  that the energy in the system approaches zero. I don't know why that law just
[12:05.530 --> 12:10.210]  doesn't say at absolute zero everything stops, but it doesn't. It says as you
[12:10.210 --> 12:17.890]  approach absolute zero you get less energy. Some British chemists said
[12:17.890 --> 12:23.530]  about these three laws. He said the first one you could say there's no
[12:23.530 --> 12:30.930]  free lunch. That's another way to say this. He said you can't win because
[12:30.930 --> 12:39.690]  it's always balanced. The second law is you can't even break even
[12:40.050 --> 12:47.450]  because the world tends to lower entropy. The fourth law, you can't even
[12:47.450 --> 12:51.890]  get out of the game. You can't quit the game. You're always at some
[12:51.890 --> 12:57.490]  temperature. We're going to focus on this. Energy in, energy out. Right away
[12:57.490 --> 13:06.850]  if we can measure these components we can calculate the missing components.
[13:06.850 --> 13:16.250]  In the simplest sense, if this is radiation in, so for now we'll do R for
[13:16.250 --> 13:24.690]  radiation. Over here we have transpiration plus conduction and
[13:24.690 --> 13:30.890]  convection. These different people use different symbols for these, but I
[13:30.890 --> 13:37.770]  have typically used C squared. That's a 2. For conduction and convection we
[13:37.770 --> 13:42.330]  consider simultaneously. The heat goes into the molecules and the molecules
[13:42.330 --> 13:48.570]  blown away, but they're in one term. This doesn't mathematically mean C times C.
[13:48.570 --> 13:54.770]  It just means there's C squared. That's pretty simple. That's the
[13:54.770 --> 14:01.450]  essence of this whole energy balance equation. These have to balance.
[14:01.450 --> 14:07.210]  Why we have whole textbooks on this thing to analyze this if it's this
[14:07.210 --> 14:16.410]  simple? This is reduced to the simplest components. Any good plant person is
[14:16.410 --> 14:20.730]  going to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, there's photosynthesis in this and some
[14:20.730 --> 14:29.770]  of the energy goes into photosynthesis. It's correct. Over here we have P
[14:29.770 --> 14:37.530]  for photosynthesis and that's some of the energy. Now we're getting a little
[14:37.530 --> 14:41.930]  more complicated and more detailed. Now let me stop right here and make a
[14:41.930 --> 14:49.890]  mention about some of the principles for this. Many books talk about this. Let me
[14:49.890 --> 14:57.640]  start with a different book. Pretty much every university teaches plant
[14:57.640 --> 15:02.680]  physiology, whether they're an agriculture, land grant school, or anything that teaches
[15:02.680 --> 15:07.840]  plant physiology. Every year new editions of new plant physiology
[15:07.840 --> 15:12.960]  textbooks come out. This is Thyssen-Ziger, one we use here. You open up this
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.200]  fat treat as it gets thicker every year. Try to find energy balance analysis in
[15:18.280 --> 15:24.560]  this textbook. It's not in here. That is not a traditional part of plant physiology.
[15:24.560 --> 15:30.240]  This deals with chemical principles and it deals with single leaves. When it
[15:30.240 --> 15:36.800]  gets to calculating evapotranspiration, that's not a subject covered in this
[15:36.800 --> 15:43.480]  book. They do cover what causes stomates to open and close, which is a key part of
[15:43.480 --> 15:50.000]  this. That's it. They do mention water use efficiency in here, but
[15:50.000 --> 15:58.080]  they don't talk about covering that. Lots of other books do. One of my
[15:58.080 --> 16:03.040]  favorites that I learned this stuff from, and fortunately it's now in the fourth
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.960]  edition, is this book by Park Nobel, Physiochemical and Environmental
[16:08.960 --> 16:15.920]  Plant Physiology. The principles of what I'm talking about are in this book in
[16:15.920 --> 16:23.480]  chapter 7. I use the same symbols as he does in this book, so it's a great
[16:23.480 --> 16:31.720]  reference for looking at the principles. I brought with me a few other key
[16:31.720 --> 16:39.920]  books that have been important to me and also talk about these principles. One
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.760]  that many people are familiar with is Galen Campbell's book and John Norman,
[16:44.760 --> 16:50.800]  An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics. This has got a lot of great
[16:50.800 --> 16:57.160]  stuff in it. It shows basic equations for this. This is also a good reference on
[16:57.160 --> 17:05.640]  these things. Hamlin Jones, Plants and Microclimate, A Quantitative Approach to
[17:05.640 --> 17:10.800]  Environmental Plant Physiology. Anytime somebody puts quantitative approach in
[17:10.800 --> 17:15.200]  the title some of the students go, I'm going to try to avoid that class. The
[17:15.200 --> 17:20.280]  other students go, wow this is cool, I've got to sign up for that. It depends on
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.160]  how good people are with quantitative approaches. Here's a third one,
[17:25.160 --> 17:30.840]  Environmental Physiology of Plants. This subject matter is
[17:30.840 --> 17:35.640]  covered in many books, it's just not covered in traditional plant physiology
[17:35.640 --> 17:45.400]  textbooks. Let's go back to our equation here. We're putting in photosynthesis
[17:45.400 --> 17:51.920]  because some of the energy goes there. Now if we were doing energy balance
[17:52.400 --> 18:01.840]  analysis of ourselves, which we do, we've standing out in the sun, we've got
[18:01.840 --> 18:10.880]  radiation in, you got to drink water to stay hydrated. If you get hot you lose
[18:10.880 --> 18:16.760]  heat by conduction and convection. Photosynthesis for most of us is
[18:16.880 --> 18:22.520]  approaching zero. I'm still working on that chlorophyll gene so I can stand out
[18:22.520 --> 18:31.640]  in the sun and I don't have to eat, just have to get green skin. Our bodies are
[18:31.640 --> 18:42.360]  above room temperature because of respiration. Now we've got respiration in
[18:42.360 --> 18:48.040]  here and in the case of plants so do they have respiration. When they
[18:48.040 --> 18:56.000]  respire, that's exothermic, that warms them up. Because respiration is
[18:56.000 --> 19:05.640]  adding to the heat, we really have to do something like minus respiration because
[19:05.640 --> 19:13.480]  it's giving off heat that's not using it. Anytime we burn up heat. Those
[19:13.480 --> 19:23.880]  four components are the essence of this. Four on this side. What happens
[19:23.880 --> 19:32.200]  when something changes temperature? Energy in equals energy out.
[19:32.200 --> 19:43.000]  This balances over long time periods but if you take a black piece of metal and
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.320]  walk out in the sunlight out there and lay it out, it's going to get hotter.
[19:47.320 --> 19:54.200]  It's going to get hot fast and this won't balance because it's heating up.
[19:54.200 --> 19:59.280]  Some of the energy is going in to change the temperature. Then we bring that
[19:59.280 --> 20:04.360]  back into the room and it's cooling down and we got all our hundred
[20:04.360 --> 20:09.640]  instruments around this thing and energy doesn't balance. It's cooling off because
[20:09.640 --> 20:15.200]  it doesn't balance. We have to have another term over here and that's
[20:15.200 --> 20:18.200]  usually called G and that's storage.
[20:19.200 --> 20:29.960]  Storage is easy. That's either heating up or cooling off. In the case of a
[20:29.960 --> 20:36.240]  leaf, and my analysis is going to do a single leaf now, just one leaf out
[20:36.240 --> 20:40.280]  there in the Sun. How are we going to make the energy balance for that? We get a
[20:40.280 --> 20:44.280]  leaf right and then we can go to bigger things, canopies and all kinds of bigger
[20:44.280 --> 20:47.280]  things.
[20:48.320 --> 20:55.400]  How much goes into photosynthesis? Let's just start with a rough estimate of the
[20:55.400 --> 21:05.520]  size of these parameters up here. I'm going to ask you how efficient is
[21:05.520 --> 21:12.280]  photosynthesis? Of course you ought to know this from some classes. What's the
[21:12.280 --> 21:17.800]  efficiency of photosynthesis? You can say that in the test tube
[21:17.800 --> 21:22.440]  algae can be this good, in the field they're this good, but about how efficient is
[21:22.440 --> 21:31.160]  photosynthesis? You get any idea? Boston, do you know? That's correct. It's not very
[21:31.160 --> 21:38.520]  dang efficient. What does that mean? Less than 50%? Less than 20%?
[21:38.520 --> 21:50.040]  Photosynthesis can be up to 30% efficient in a test tube with
[21:50.040 --> 21:59.480]  algae in perfect conditions. When we go to the field we're talking more like
[21:59.480 --> 22:05.840]  5% efficiency. It obviously varies if it's how bright the light is. There's a
[22:05.840 --> 22:12.000]  whole bunch of factors. Let's just go with 5% here.
[22:15.000 --> 22:23.680]  That means 95% of the action is somewhere else in this equation. If
[22:23.680 --> 22:34.560]  photosynthesis is 5% how much energy comes out in respiration? In people
[22:34.720 --> 22:40.320]  it's energy balance in people. The food you eat is that's how much energy you
[22:40.320 --> 22:47.080]  get. This has to balance in food too. If we ate five grams of food we'd have
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.480]  five grams of respiration. In plants that are growing, respiration is
[22:52.480 --> 22:59.080]  typically a third of photosynthesis because they're storing energy as they
[22:59.080 --> 23:07.240]  get bigger. Respiration might be 2%.
[23:07.240 --> 23:13.840]  Now we're getting down to some terms that are pretty small.
[23:13.840 --> 23:23.640]  Storage is insignificant.
[23:23.640 --> 23:34.800]  I'm going to see if I can draw a three-dimensional leaf here. Something
[23:34.800 --> 23:44.560]  like this. One of the calculations in Park Nobel's book is how much a leaf
[23:44.560 --> 23:48.840]  could store, how much energy a leaf could store given the magnitude of the
[23:48.840 --> 23:53.680]  radiation coming in. He shows mathematically it's insignificant. A
[23:53.680 --> 24:01.560]  leaf is so thin there's not much mass there and 50% of a leaf is air. A leaf is
[24:01.560 --> 24:07.160]  just a bunch of cells with air in between them. It's a fraction of a
[24:07.160 --> 24:13.800]  millimeter thick. In a single leaf we just ignore storage. This is absolutely
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.640]  not true as soon as soil enters the equation. Soil now is huge, but when we're
[24:18.640 --> 24:23.160]  talking about the leaves of plants, storage is insignificant and both of
[24:23.160 --> 24:29.920]  these are tiny. We can easily calculate this one too because...
[24:29.920 --> 24:42.280]  Let me draw a graph of this. Let's think about this efficiency of
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.920]  photosynthesis for a minute. If I draw a graph, I'm going to do this in a different
[24:48.000 --> 24:56.840]  color here of photosynthesis. I love drawing XY plots. I got a lot of XY
[24:56.840 --> 25:04.600]  plots. Sometimes I think I dream in XY plots. Here's radiation in
[25:04.600 --> 25:17.280]  and here's zero. It's dark and we get up here to 1000
[25:17.400 --> 25:24.160]  watts per meter squared. That's typically full sunlight in a summer
[25:24.160 --> 25:33.080]  day. Normally we do this graph with just photosynthetic radiation with
[25:33.080 --> 25:38.040]  photons, but for these purposes this is okay. We got energy coming in and over
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.200]  here we're going to have photosynthesis. Here's another thing that people
[25:45.240 --> 25:52.440]  understand the shape of this graph at different levels. If this was a high
[25:52.440 --> 25:58.600]  school class, a correct answer to that question, if somebody said it looks like
[25:58.600 --> 26:09.800]  that, they'd probably get full credit. But what's wrong with this straight line?
[26:09.800 --> 26:16.120]  Why is that not full credit for a more advanced class? What does it look like?
[26:16.120 --> 26:26.120]  Yeah, it can't keep going. It tops out. That part's wrong.
[26:26.120 --> 26:32.760]  Now we're up to plant science 301 and that's the correct answer.
[26:32.760 --> 26:39.880]  But it's not correct for plant science 501 or whatever number we're
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.880]  putting on this. What's still wrong about that?
[26:48.720 --> 26:55.840]  What if we put a plant in the dark? Reagent grade darkness right here.
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.360]  These are not plastic plants. They're real plants. We put them in the dark,
[27:02.360 --> 27:11.320]  they have respiration. So we put the plant in the dark and this is zero. It
[27:11.320 --> 27:20.400]  has to go somewhere down here. This line has to curve like that.
[27:20.400 --> 27:31.360]  Now that line is correct at plant science 501. We've got this dynamic down
[27:31.360 --> 27:38.920]  here at zero and we've got the flat line as a general shape of this line.
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.360]  When we get these five percent numbers we're usually somewhere, I'll put this in green,
[27:45.360 --> 27:52.000]  we're usually somewhere on this part of the curve. Early part of the curve where
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.200]  we get higher photosynthesis. By the time we get out to full Sun and we're out
[27:57.200 --> 28:07.080]  here, now we're down to maybe two percent efficient in full Sun because it just
[28:07.080 --> 28:12.440]  tops out. When we say five percent, yeah it's correct if the sun's not too
[28:12.440 --> 28:17.400]  bright. The efficiency is like this and here's five percent and that's
[28:17.400 --> 28:24.920]  and that slope of that line is more like two percent. Most of this
[28:24.920 --> 28:28.760]  transpiration, which is what we're ultimately after in this thing, is
[28:28.760 --> 28:35.280]  happening during the bright light parts of the day and the rest of this we can
[28:35.280 --> 28:39.960]  ignore it for the first-order estimates of transpiration and
[28:39.960 --> 28:45.680]  conduction and convection. There are times when a refined analysis will
[28:45.680 --> 28:52.360]  include photosynthesis but typically not. Typically we're just dealing with this
[28:52.360 --> 28:59.840]  part right here, even though that's the full equation as it relates to plants.
[28:59.840 --> 29:07.880]  We can put numbers on this. Quickly put numbers on this and the sum of these two
[29:08.360 --> 29:19.100]  boxes has to equal this one. Let's do a very quick calculation. I just love
[29:19.100 --> 29:25.860]  back-of-the-envelope calculations and the goal of this class is to get
[29:25.860 --> 29:31.140]  everybody to where every time somebody asks a question they go, hmm you got some
[29:31.140 --> 29:35.460]  paper? You can calculate stuff. There's all kinds of things you can
[29:35.500 --> 29:45.420]  calculate if you get started and get a little background. Let's say we have
[29:45.420 --> 29:52.740]  radiation in a thousand watts per meter squared.
[29:55.900 --> 30:00.300]  Now this is a nice number to remember because right now that's about the
[30:00.300 --> 30:09.820]  radiation outside this classroom. Coming in, let's say our leaf right here is
[30:09.820 --> 30:17.580]  evaporating to be anatomically correct. Water always has to be shown in blue.
[30:17.580 --> 30:26.100]  This leaf is evaporating enough water to stay exactly at the same temperature as
[30:26.100 --> 30:32.020]  the air. This happens all the time. If you put a wet dish rag on your clothesline,
[30:32.020 --> 30:38.100]  black dish rag maybe to simulate a leaf, and you measure the temperature of that,
[30:38.100 --> 30:43.300]  it's going to be pretty close to air temperature because it's evaporating
[30:43.300 --> 30:50.260]  water at the same rate as the energy is coming in. In fact, a very wet dish
[30:50.260 --> 30:55.180]  rag is pretty often below air temperature around here. Then
[30:55.180 --> 30:59.620]  as soon as it starts to dry out, now it's still evaporating water but it goes
[30:59.620 --> 31:06.980]  above air temperature. Let's say it's the same.
[31:06.980 --> 31:15.420]  Conduction and convection is zero. If it's the same, if this leaf is
[31:15.420 --> 31:26.740]  25 degrees C and the air is 25 degrees C, that exchange is zero. Now we've
[31:26.740 --> 31:32.740]  really simplified this energy balance analysis to see where we're at because
[31:32.740 --> 31:41.340]  we got a hundred watts coming in, zeroes here, how much water is it evaporating?
[31:41.340 --> 31:54.780]  What you find out in this analysis is a huge part of it is just units
[31:54.780 --> 31:59.740]  conversion from getting one unit to the next, getting them all straightened out.
[31:59.740 --> 32:04.340]  Once you get that then I tell people a monkey could do the last part of it.
[32:04.340 --> 32:09.620]  Just a computer can do the last part of it. You get the units right. What we
[32:09.620 --> 32:17.260]  want to know is transpiration and what we know is energy coming in.
[32:17.260 --> 32:26.540]  Let's start by looking up a typical number.
[32:26.540 --> 32:36.130]  I can put this over here. I can even zoom in. Here we go.
[32:38.130 --> 32:48.690]  Too much zoom in. This is out of this book right here, Utah Climate. It's
[32:48.690 --> 32:54.850]  published by the Climate Center and it's just a bunch of statistics of climate.
[32:54.850 --> 33:02.090]  In this example here I have pulled out the campus weather station. This is
[33:02.090 --> 33:06.130]  30-year data. This is not our new environmental observatory. This is
[33:06.130 --> 33:13.770]  a older station, real old, up by the place you buy ice cream up there,
[33:13.770 --> 33:20.610]  Nutrition and Food Science. Here's every month of the year evapotranspiration
[33:20.730 --> 33:30.570]  inches per month. We're going to take the highest transpiration month of the
[33:30.570 --> 33:40.290]  year. 7.48 inches. This is per month and that is 0.24 inches per day.
[33:40.290 --> 33:48.730]  It's 0.6 centimeters a day. This is measured by, I think this one, this is
[33:48.730 --> 33:53.090]  measured by pan evaporation. Taking a pan with water in it and looking how
[33:53.090 --> 33:58.970]  much water evaporates in that pan. It's an old-time honored simple method to do
[33:58.970 --> 34:15.410]  this. Pan evaporation, we get a number right here, equals 0.6 centimeters per
[34:15.410 --> 34:23.010]  day. This is supposed to balance but we don't have the units in the right order
[34:23.010 --> 34:34.530]  yet. To put the units in the right order, there's one key number that you
[34:34.530 --> 34:38.770]  could probably have tattooed on your arm so you could always remember this
[34:38.770 --> 35:02.030]  number. LHE, latent heat of evaporation. I use this number enough I can
[35:02.030 --> 35:18.990]  remember it. 2.45 megajoules per liter. This is close to a constant. If the
[35:18.990 --> 35:26.270]  water is almost boiling, this is something like 2.41. If the water is
[35:26.270 --> 35:36.230]  freezing, it's something like 2.49. It's 2.45 megajoules per liter at 25 degrees C.
[35:36.230 --> 35:41.510]  Really this temperature doesn't matter that much. This is a three
[35:41.510 --> 35:45.350]  significant digits. All of them round off to 2.45.
[35:45.350 --> 35:55.310]  Neither liters nor megajoules is in this equation yet. For this
[35:55.350 --> 36:04.190]  first lecture I want to take some units and see if this is zero. If we do this
[36:04.190 --> 36:15.150]  conversion here. Now I'm going to erase my photosynthesis. We're still
[36:15.150 --> 36:29.760]  talking about our leaf. 1000 watts is coming in. Now this is a real simple
[36:29.760 --> 36:36.880]  physical principle but it trips people up a lot. A watt is a rate of energy
[36:36.880 --> 36:46.080]  flow. Most people could probably answer on a test. A watt is a joule per
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.280]  second. This happens so much rates of energy we just have this
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.160]  nickname for them called the watt. It trips people up sometimes and think the
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.760]  whole thing would be simpler if we always just said joules per second.
[36:59.760 --> 37:06.320]  Going back and forth in this is a is really helpful. One of the ways to help
[37:06.440 --> 37:20.640]  think about this is if we had a gallon of gas in here and you said how many
[37:20.640 --> 37:26.240]  watts are in that gallon of gas? Somebody whips out their phone and they
[37:26.240 --> 37:29.280]  say I'm watts in a gallon of gas. They say I can't find it.
[37:29.280 --> 37:35.480]  I can't find it. If you said how much energy is in that gallon of gas it's
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.440]  easy. You can find the energy in a gallon of gas. It's six to the tenth
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.800]  bajillion joules of energy in a gallon of gas. Now if I light a match and I
[37:45.800 --> 37:52.760]  blow it up it is six bazillion watts of power because it blew up in one second.
[37:52.760 --> 38:00.000]  Watt is a rate of energy like release or energy transfer and joules is
[38:00.000 --> 38:09.280]  the fundamental unit of energy. Now let's put this down here. 1000 joules per
[38:09.280 --> 38:23.210]  meter squared per second. Now we're dealing with centimeters a day. I can see
[38:23.210 --> 38:30.570]  a conversion I need to make right away. This is the maximum rate of energy
[38:30.570 --> 38:37.410]  coming in in the middle of the day. This one is the total water for the whole day.
[38:37.410 --> 38:46.890]  So over here we got seconds and over here we got days. I'm going to put another
[38:46.890 --> 39:01.850]  curve here. This is noon, solar noon. Up here this is a thousand watts per
[39:01.850 --> 39:07.490]  meter squared, the brightest we get typically in the middle of the day.
[39:07.490 --> 39:13.010]  If we're going to compare all the energy coming in a day to all the water we
[39:13.010 --> 39:22.210]  used in a day we have to have the area under that curve. When we do that we
[39:22.210 --> 39:30.770]  get 30 megajoules per meter squared per day.
[39:31.370 --> 39:39.970]  These are a full sun summer day. 30 megajoules integrated under the curve.
[39:39.970 --> 39:46.930]  For comparison, over here I'm going to change my units. Instead of
[39:46.930 --> 39:55.570]  thousand joules, 30 megajoules per day. Now we at least have the time on the
[39:55.570 --> 40:07.050]  same on both axes. 0.6 centimeters of water from a pan evaporating to
[40:07.050 --> 40:16.850]  possibly keep this equal. Now we have to get this meter squared equal on both
[40:16.850 --> 40:30.780]  sides. To do that we're going to take a tray, a giant cookie sheet. We should
[40:30.780 --> 40:34.740]  sell cookie sheets, 1 meter squared cookie sheets for teaching purposes.
[40:34.740 --> 40:41.660]  You could lay them out and you could put water in them. This is 1 meter
[40:41.660 --> 40:48.540]  squared. Our reference sheet, the radiation is coming in to that 1 meter
[40:48.540 --> 40:56.660]  squared. If we evaporate 0.6 centimeters of water, how many liters is that?
[40:56.660 --> 41:07.860]  To put the liters equal, this is a hundred centimeters. This is a hundred
[41:07.860 --> 41:16.380]  centimeters. 1 meter squared is 10,000 centimeters squared. 10 to the
[41:16.380 --> 41:21.700]  fourth. This trips people up a lot because so much stuff is 10 to the third,
[41:21.700 --> 41:26.260]  10 to the third, everything's multiples of 10 to the third. This one is not. This is 10 to
[41:26.260 --> 41:35.260]  the fourth because it's a hundred times a hundred. Then remember another reason
[41:35.260 --> 41:42.940]  that the metric system is so far superior to any other system. 1 centimeter
[41:42.940 --> 41:55.420]  cubed is 1 milliliter is 1 gram. Everybody learns that in high school.
[41:55.420 --> 42:00.820]  Then I do a true-false test and I say this and this is 1 milligram.
[42:00.820 --> 42:06.140]  I put the milliliter really big and half the class misses it. It's a gram.
[42:06.140 --> 42:12.220]  This is a milliliter but that's a gram. We're getting close to getting our
[42:12.220 --> 42:26.940]  units the same. 1 liter is 10 times 10 to the 10, a thousand cubic centimeters.
[42:26.940 --> 42:46.060]  1 centimeter deep, 1 centimeter of water times 10 to the fourth
[42:46.060 --> 42:59.500]  centimeters of area is 10 to the fourth centimeters cubed or 10,000 centimeters
[42:59.500 --> 43:11.580]  cubed or 10,000 grams and 10,000 milliliters. 1 centimeter deep is 10
[43:11.580 --> 43:37.460]  liters. When we do this evaporation and 0.6 centimeters per day is 6 liters.
[43:37.460 --> 43:44.940]  I have to erase part of my liter. Per meter squared per day. I went over this
[43:44.940 --> 43:53.460]  math pretty fast but it's not complicated. A centimeter deep on a
[43:53.460 --> 43:58.820]  liter tray. If we had a liter of water and we poured it into a meter squared
[43:58.820 --> 44:04.220]  tray it'd be a millimeter deep. If we had 10 liters of water and we poured it in
[44:04.540 --> 44:12.820]  it'd be a centimeter deep in the tray. 0.6 centimeters a day in a meter squared
[44:12.820 --> 44:24.060]  area is 6 liters of water. We have 30 megajoules coming in per meter squared
[44:24.060 --> 44:29.260]  per day. Now we finally got units the same.
[44:29.260 --> 44:41.580]  30 megajoules in 6 liters. Now we bring out our latent heat of evaporation.
[44:41.580 --> 44:56.060]  30 megajoules divided by 2.45 megajoules per liter.
[44:56.060 --> 45:00.140]  I think this comes out to about 12. I'm going to put about here because it's
[45:00.140 --> 45:13.990]  real close. 12 liters per meter squared per day. This is how much water would
[45:13.990 --> 45:19.710]  have to evaporate to keep this thing at the exact same temperature as the
[45:19.710 --> 45:27.390]  air. What happened in this calculation, when we measure this we only get
[45:27.430 --> 45:34.030]  6 liters. I'm going to wind up in this principle because tomorrow we'll pick it
[45:34.030 --> 45:40.870]  up from here. If this was all that was going on you would then write in your
[45:40.870 --> 45:48.430]  notebooks, well clearly the object got hot because it doesn't balance. It needed
[45:48.430 --> 45:54.830]  to evaporate 12 liters of water to keep itself at air temperature and it only
[45:54.870 --> 46:02.670]  evaporated 6. It doesn't balance. This cannot be zero. It heats up.
[46:02.670 --> 46:11.750]  You would be correct in the analysis of this, but it's more complicated
[46:11.750 --> 46:22.190]  than that. This is only shortwave radiation in. This was a very simple
[46:22.230 --> 46:27.990]  analysis. This assumed every watt of this was absorbed and some of this gets
[46:27.990 --> 46:35.990]  reflected. Some gets transmitted. This is only shortwave radiation. We have to
[46:35.990 --> 46:44.270]  calculate longwave radiation to do a comprehensive analysis. I've filled up
[46:44.270 --> 46:50.910]  the board, but tomorrow we'll break down this radiation into its component parts
[46:51.150 --> 46:59.150]  to see how much of that radiation actually got absorbed. Here's a
[46:59.150 --> 47:04.950]  perfect example. We do pan evaporation to get these numbers. Put a pan
[47:04.950 --> 47:09.590]  out, measure the water evaporating at time honored. What if the plant tray is
[47:09.590 --> 47:15.990]  made out of aluminum foil and one another tray is painted flat black? Huge
[47:15.990 --> 47:22.150]  difference in evaporation from those two. We got to account for the different
[47:22.150 --> 47:28.670]  amounts of radiation absorbed in order to make this balance. This is an
[47:28.670 --> 47:33.710]  empirical number, 0.6 centimeters a day during the hottest month of the year
[47:33.710 --> 47:42.910]  around here. Once we get this number analyzed then we can start to
[47:42.910 --> 47:48.070]  look at partitioning between how hot the object gets and how much water
[47:48.070 --> 47:55.630]  has to evaporate. This is largely driven by just the
[47:55.630 --> 47:59.990]  temperature difference. We can measure the temperature difference of this and
[47:59.990 --> 48:05.310]  we start to zero in on transpiration, which like I said we don't have any good
[48:05.310 --> 48:12.590]  instruments to measure that directly. This is an example of some simple
[48:13.270 --> 48:24.270]  units to get to this. I'd like to end sometimes with a homework assignment
[48:24.270 --> 48:28.070]  which I'll just tell you the homework assignments in here and you can decide
[48:28.070 --> 48:35.310]  if you want to work them. I said this whole thing is units conversion.
[48:35.310 --> 48:40.070]  Here's a homework assignment. Sometimes I've
[48:40.070 --> 48:46.470]  given this on the first day of class. Einstein's one of the
[48:46.470 --> 48:51.830]  top five most important equations in the world equals mc squared. How much energy
[48:51.830 --> 48:58.350]  is in one pea seed if this is right and how long could you live if you just ate
[48:58.350 --> 49:03.990]  one pea seed? You could use all the energy in that pea seed. Of course c
[49:03.990 --> 49:09.630]  squared, the speed of light squared, is a huge number so it's a lot of energy.
[49:09.670 --> 49:13.950]  This is about the simplest equation you can get and now think about units
[49:13.950 --> 49:21.030]  conversion. Get the energy in a pea seed from the typical weight of a pea and
[49:21.030 --> 49:30.150]  this because mc squared with SI units and SI unit conversion comes out to be
[49:30.150 --> 49:38.830]  joules of energy in the pea seed. I'll show you the key for this tomorrow if
[49:38.910 --> 49:43.150]  you want. The key for this is setting it up with the units and looking at
[49:43.150 --> 49:46.150]  this. I'm not going to quite stop yet.
[49:46.150 --> 50:03.470]  Which brings me to, particularly if I can find the handout of this,
[50:03.470 --> 50:13.950]  here. All of you know SI units. Here's a nice symbol for the whole world. SI units are
[50:13.950 --> 50:20.350]  wonderfully simple. Seven base units and these calculations get immensely
[50:20.350 --> 50:23.990]  easier to get them down. As you can see from this example, getting them down to
[50:23.990 --> 50:31.030]  base units so we can compare different things. Nowadays you can
[50:31.190 --> 50:38.350]  look these up on the internet. Not just the base units but all the relationships
[50:38.350 --> 50:41.710]  and most of them are so simple like watt and joules per second you remember them.
[50:41.710 --> 50:52.830]  Here's a little handout that I've found useful on this for some of the
[50:52.830 --> 50:58.510]  relationships. This is a two-sided handout and it helps to understand the
[50:58.510 --> 51:03.630]  relationships. When we talk about energy balance we're only talking
[51:03.630 --> 51:14.350]  about a very small subset of all the units in here. It helps to be fluent
[51:14.350 --> 51:20.550]  in the simplest relationships of SI units. This is something I found
[51:20.550 --> 51:32.030]  that's useful. I got a second one that I found useful. That just looks like this.
[51:32.030 --> 51:36.550]  The first one's a double-sided. It's got some units on the back. This is just
[51:36.550 --> 51:43.550]  conversions among units. Every single beginning chemistry book has these SI
[51:43.550 --> 51:49.750]  units in the front. Sometimes I think people see those and they go yeah
[51:49.750 --> 51:52.830]  yeah good and then they can forget about them for years and years. Then you
[51:52.830 --> 51:58.910]  get to an energy balance analysis and you have to remember them and use them.
[51:58.910 --> 52:05.910]  I'm going to stop here and we'll pick this up tomorrow.
[52:05.910 --> 52:25.310]  I must have not hit double-sided in the copy machine.
[52:25.310 --> 52:33.230]  All those are one side and it's the meters. We need to copy the second side.
[52:33.230 --> 52:42.550]  This is even worse because this one has the same thing on both sides. This is
[52:42.550 --> 52:45.550]  really mild.
[52:48.550 --> 52:52.670]  Wait a minute, this is all seven units. There's no two sides.
[52:52.670 --> 52:57.950]  It's one side. I said two sides because I was looking at the other.
[52:57.950 --> 53:03.870]  No, I'm wrong. It does have two sides. It just takes a subset of the units.
[53:03.870 --> 53:08.950]  It does have two sides. The first side is self-sufficient and the next side is a
[53:08.950 --> 53:16.910]  subset of these with some of the more common ones. We can copy this and I can
[53:16.910 --> 53:23.910]  give you the second side tomorrow.
[53:23.910 --> 53:28.910]  Any questions?
[53:28.910 --> 53:31.910]  Apply this.
[53:41.910 --> 53:50.630]  No, no. For the purposes of the class I'm going to introduce the seventh term
[53:50.630 --> 53:59.430]  tomorrow. In a nutshell it's splitting radiation into short and long wave.
[54:09.430 --> 54:16.230]  I like to start with the simplest thing and then get more complex.
[54:16.230 --> 54:22.510]  To work this out in five or eight minutes and see how to finally get it
[54:22.510 --> 54:28.110]  in the same units, that's the essence of energy balance. Then you get to
[54:28.110 --> 54:34.710]  where, ok, it doesn't balance. Now why not? Are our instruments not calibrated?
[54:34.710 --> 54:41.310]  The answer in this particular case is the model is not complex
[54:41.310 --> 54:46.830]  enough yet to account for that. It's a model that needs to be more
[54:46.830 --> 54:56.630]  detailed to account for it. As a rule of thumb, well-watered plants stay
[54:56.630 --> 55:02.470]  very close to air temperature. This term for well-watered plants is always
[55:02.470 --> 55:09.990]  small. If we get all the radiation right and this is exactly air
[55:09.990 --> 55:14.990]  temperature, then we know transpiration. We got to do short and long
[55:14.990 --> 55:20.630]  wave both to get that term right. As soon as they run out of water, of course,
[55:20.630 --> 55:25.230]  imagine a cactus in the desert. One of my students came back and said it's 100.
[55:25.230 --> 55:30.390]  They were in Phoenix last week and they said I can't see how people, man, they go
[55:30.390 --> 55:34.230]  from one building as quick as possible to the next air-conditioned building.
[55:34.230 --> 55:40.070]  It was 115 in the day but it cooled off to 90 at night.
[55:40.070 --> 55:43.230]  How far is my car? Can I make it?
[55:43.230 --> 55:52.470]  Imagine a cactus without water. The tissues of that
[55:52.470 --> 55:59.830]  cactus are just astronomically hot and it just sits there. A cactus has almost
[55:59.950 --> 56:05.350]  no transpiration in the middle of the summer. Now we can run this the other
[56:05.350 --> 56:12.670]  way. What if T was zero? Now we run this analysis for putting a metal
[56:12.670 --> 56:16.590]  hammer outside in the sun to get the equilibrium. Now try and pick up the
[56:16.590 --> 56:21.150]  hammer and it's so hot you can't pick it up because this is an enormous number
[56:21.150 --> 56:37.230]  and this one's zero. On the timing, I'm thinking if we do every day this week,
[56:37.230 --> 56:46.150]  that's five lectures, we could put eight lectures. When I look at what I've
[56:46.150 --> 56:52.870]  done, typically it's maybe more like six or seven lectures.
[56:52.870 --> 56:56.630]  Usually I give a pretty long lecture in the beginning about how I'm going to
[56:56.630 --> 57:03.470]  grade the class and stuff like that. You can just skip all that. We could do
[57:03.470 --> 57:08.350]  this whole thing by the end of the week. Maybe. Let's see how we're at.
[57:08.350 --> 57:15.070]  Particularly today I tried to do, I don't know how long was that,
[57:15.070 --> 57:22.190]  and that was including the introductory stuff that we might edit
[57:22.190 --> 57:29.590]  out. I'm going to try and do one hour of stuff. If I did an hour and a
[57:29.590 --> 57:33.950]  half where we did some and we stopped and took a little break, we
[57:33.950 --> 57:38.150]  could get done by the end of the week. If we get into more details in
[57:38.190 --> 57:44.550]  there's more questions, well then it'll take longer.
[57:44.550 --> 57:52.990]  I'll try to weave into this the instruments we use. Everything's a
[57:52.990 --> 57:57.190]  component of the whole thing. There's no single instrument to measure what we
[57:57.190 --> 58:02.390]  want to know. We just surround it with indirect instruments and basically
[58:02.430 --> 58:08.950]  calculate it by subtraction, which is how we do everything. If we can measure
[58:08.950 --> 58:12.430]  something easily then we just measure it. There's a whole bunch of stuff that
[58:12.430 --> 58:18.150]  we can't measure so we have to model it. Transpiration is one that's subject of
[58:18.150 --> 58:21.150]  all kinds of models.
[58:22.470 --> 58:24.110]  Alright, I'll stop there.
