[00:00.830 --> 00:06.710]  Good morning, I'm Bruce Bugbee and today we're going to talk about air
[00:06.710 --> 00:12.310]  temperature sensors. This is really part one in a series of environmental
[00:12.310 --> 00:18.750]  measurement seminars that we've designed to educate people on the key principles.
[00:18.750 --> 00:26.230]  I am joined in this effort by my colleague Mark Blonquist who is the
[00:26.230 --> 00:30.670]  chief scientist for Apogee Instruments. He isn't going to be doing the talking
[00:30.670 --> 00:36.790]  but he and I have worked together to analyze a wide range of sensors for
[00:36.790 --> 00:40.430]  environmental measurement. So we're going to start with perhaps the most
[00:40.430 --> 00:46.590]  fundamental measurement of all which is air temperature. If you would ask me when
[00:46.590 --> 00:51.030]  I was an undergraduate, do you know how to measure air temperature? I would say,
[00:51.030 --> 00:55.230]  oh yes, of course I know all about it. If you would ask me as a master's student, do
[00:55.230 --> 00:59.030]  I know how to measure air temperature? I would say, yes, kind of, but there's
[00:59.030 --> 01:04.150]  challenges. If you ask me as a experienced scientist, do I know how to
[01:04.150 --> 01:08.070]  measure air temperature? I would probably say something like, that is a really
[01:08.070 --> 01:13.630]  challenging measurement. So we're going to help bring you up to the cutting edge of just
[01:13.630 --> 01:19.310]  the sensors today to do this. In a separate talk we'll talk about shields. So
[01:19.310 --> 01:23.550]  this is the simplest thing. What kind of electronic sensors would you use for air
[01:23.550 --> 01:30.030]  temperature measurement? Historically we've used alcohol thermometers and
[01:30.030 --> 01:35.550]  mercury and glass thermometers but those are not electronic output. You can't
[01:35.550 --> 01:40.110]  record those. You've got to have a sensor that makes an electric output so we can
[01:40.110 --> 01:45.830]  do continuous recording of it. So this is all about sensors that have electronic
[01:45.830 --> 01:52.510]  output. Now let's jump to a picture that we've made that shows sizes and types of
[01:52.550 --> 02:00.790]  sensors. Here's a wide range of sizes and in a minute I'll tell you why size is so
[02:00.790 --> 02:06.550]  critical. Let's just run over the sizes all the way from a human hair and look
[02:06.550 --> 02:14.030]  at the size of this .002 inches, .06 millimeters. This is tiny. Just barely
[02:14.030 --> 02:20.030]  above that we can get fine wire thermistors that are just barely thicker
[02:20.030 --> 02:25.870]  than a human hair. Now these are used in a syringe to inject into an
[02:25.870 --> 02:31.630]  animal to measure internal temperature of an animal but they stay very close to
[02:31.630 --> 02:38.270]  air temperature because they are so tiny. So this would be a nice sensor but this
[02:38.270 --> 02:45.190]  sensor in our long-term studies drifts. It's not a stable sensor and that's a
[02:45.190 --> 02:49.870]  critical feature of these sensors. They have to be rock-solid year after year
[02:49.870 --> 02:55.630]  after year so we're not using this fine wire sensor even though it's wonderfully
[02:55.630 --> 03:03.630]  tiny because it's not solid in long-term studies. Going up the scale, thermocouples
[03:03.630 --> 03:09.510]  are a classic electronic way of measurement. They're widely used. They're
[03:09.510 --> 03:14.750]  inexpensive. Just take a strip of wire, twist it like this, you've got a temperature
[03:14.870 --> 03:21.110]  sensor. But they are not the most accurate reference standard and for long
[03:21.110 --> 03:28.350]  runs of wire they get expensive. The cost of thermocouple wire is about ten times
[03:28.350 --> 03:34.190]  the cost of regular wire. So we mostly use these when we need to do lots of
[03:34.190 --> 03:39.630]  measurements in a small distance, a small distance from the data logger, even
[03:39.630 --> 03:47.990]  though they can be small. So then going down the list we get into the category of
[03:47.990 --> 03:54.270]  thermistors. So let's put a line under thermocouples. We'll call that number one.
[03:54.270 --> 04:03.590]  Thermistors are number two in technologies. These have a big
[04:03.590 --> 04:09.350]  signal size. They're easy to measure. For years these were considered not a
[04:09.390 --> 04:15.990]  reference standard because they drifted in the long term. So to avoid this
[04:15.990 --> 04:23.230]  problem with drift, for years we've gone to platinum resistance thermometers. Now
[04:23.230 --> 04:30.230]  lots of people know these by the acronym PRT, platinum resistance thermometer.
[04:30.230 --> 04:38.710]  Sometimes people say PRTD and that's just a temperature detector. Those are
[04:38.710 --> 04:48.150]  the same things, PRT and PRTD. This one, like the typical PRTs, is enclosed in a
[04:48.150 --> 04:55.710]  stainless steel sheath. It makes this extremely rugged but it's a bigger size
[04:55.710 --> 05:04.870]  than this thermistor, slightly bigger and a lot more expensive. So finally to get
[05:04.870 --> 05:10.870]  this even more rugged, Apogee sells a ceramic sheath thermistor, which is this
[05:10.870 --> 05:16.950]  enclosed in a big housing. You could drive over this with a truck. So for rugged
[05:16.950 --> 05:21.990]  places and direct burial in soils, this ceramic sheath thermistor is a good
[05:21.990 --> 05:30.870]  choice. But what we're down to is thermistors, particularly thermistors that are
[05:30.950 --> 05:39.270]  epoxy coated to nearly eliminate water infiltration into the sensor. That's what
[05:39.270 --> 05:45.310]  kills sensors is when water gets into them. And the only two things that water
[05:45.310 --> 05:51.270]  doesn't get through are metal and glass. Epoxy though is close. The right kinds of
[05:51.270 --> 05:57.590]  epoxy are almost as impermeable as glass. So this one has got a special epoxy
[05:57.590 --> 06:05.310]  coating to make it water impermeable and as a result of that potentially very
[06:05.310 --> 06:13.190]  stable. So we've got thermocouples, thermistors, and PRTs as the categories.
[06:13.190 --> 06:19.030]  PRTs have long been considered the gold standard but they have a couple
[06:19.030 --> 06:26.230]  disadvantages. They're big, they're expensive, and they take up a lot of data
[06:26.230 --> 06:34.110]  logger channels. Let's take a look at the effect of size in this. Small is
[06:34.110 --> 06:38.990]  better but boy these are still pretty small as far as temperature sensors go.
[06:38.990 --> 06:47.710]  So this next slide shows us the effect of size on temperature rise. So we've got
[06:47.710 --> 06:53.230]  these are all thermocouples now. So we take the same measurement technology and
[06:53.350 --> 06:58.510]  make it in different sizes. Now look at the wire diameter. These are down here
[06:58.510 --> 07:03.750]  thinner than a human hair in this part of the graph. These are all tenths of a
[07:03.750 --> 07:10.710]  millimeter, small and very small. We put these in a controlled environment with
[07:10.710 --> 07:17.910]  typical radiation loads on them and look at the increase in temperature. This is
[07:17.990 --> 07:23.070]  the difference between the true air temperature and what the sensor gave us.
[07:23.070 --> 07:32.470]  Look at this, 8 degrees C errors with big sensors in low wind speeds. This number
[07:32.470 --> 07:42.670]  over here, U, is wind speed right there. So these are all fairly low wind speeds but
[07:42.670 --> 07:51.310]  they occur on calm days. So this is high radiation coming into it. This is
[07:51.310 --> 07:56.030]  intermediate radiation. The point of this whole slide is these errors are
[07:56.030 --> 08:01.630]  gargantuan. If you're trying to get within a few tenths of a degree of the
[08:01.630 --> 08:07.430]  correct air temperature, you need to have a very small sensor or make sure that
[08:07.430 --> 08:12.230]  sensor doesn't see the sunlight directly. These were with no shielding and we'll
[08:12.270 --> 08:17.470]  talk about that in another seminar, the value and the importance of correct
[08:17.470 --> 08:26.030]  shielding. But for now, small is better. The errors can be enormous. So let's take a
[08:26.030 --> 08:35.310]  look at PRTs. All PRTs are not created equal. People say, oh I've got a PRT. What kind of a PRT?
[08:35.310 --> 08:42.030]  Here's the five classes of PRTs and their accuracy specifications.
[08:42.030 --> 08:51.030]  Plus or minus 1.2 degrees C, that is not a very accurate sensor, but you can go
[08:51.030 --> 08:58.790]  all the way up to 1 tenth DIN, which is an extremely accurate PRT. So you can see
[08:59.030 --> 09:09.390]  these vary a lot in accuracy. Look at how much they vary in cost. 1x to 15x. These are
[09:09.390 --> 09:15.870]  great, but they're very expensive and we'll compare these to thermistors in
[09:15.870 --> 09:25.070]  our next slide. We have done tests on these compared to this epoxy coated
[09:25.110 --> 09:31.150]  thermistor that Apogee uses to measure air temperature to see how good that is.
[09:31.150 --> 09:40.550]  So right here we're going to do this comparison of thermistors to this yellow bead PRT.
[09:40.550 --> 09:47.110]  And what we're going to compare in the next few slides is class A thermistors. So
[09:47.230 --> 09:59.110]  intermediate accuracy, similar advertised accuracy, plus or minus 0.1, plus or minus 0.15, 0.01. This is still more
[09:59.110 --> 10:07.430]  expensive, but the specified accuracy is similar. So what we did in this test is took
[10:07.430 --> 10:14.390]  replicate class A PRTs and compared them to replicate thermistors and then we
[10:14.390 --> 10:19.230]  recycled them up and down and up and down trying to make them fail. If something's
[10:19.230 --> 10:23.590]  going to go wrong, they've got to take this accelerated aging test. It was with high
[10:23.590 --> 10:30.230]  humidity, it was the worst possible scenarios. So really we can get 10 or 15 years of
[10:30.230 --> 10:34.870]  aging in just three or four months by doing this, but we want to know these are
[10:34.870 --> 10:43.910]  going to be stable for the long term. So how did this test come out? First, PRT accuracies, they're
[10:43.910 --> 10:50.310]  not equally accurate over the whole range. Here's 0C right at freezing, which is
[10:50.310 --> 10:57.550]  their peak accuracy, and as we deviate from that, these accuracies get greater. And again, here's the
[10:57.550 --> 11:04.950]  types of thermistors and their accuracy. Here's a picture of the PRT that Apogee
[11:04.950 --> 11:09.510]  sells, and we've got one right here, you can do the size comparisons.
[11:09.510 --> 11:18.670]  Apogee uses a shielded twisted pair cable. This is also a four wire ohm thermistor, which we'll
[11:18.670 --> 11:26.350]  talk about in a minute, but there for scale, there it is, not on the screen, right in my hand. By the way, so
[11:26.350 --> 11:32.870]  here's the yellow bead thermistor, tiny yellow bead, look at the difference in size, pretty close but the
[11:32.870 --> 11:42.590]  yellow bead is smaller, so if it's smaller, it stays closer to the air temperature. So how did this test come out? After beating these
[11:42.590 --> 11:52.590]  things up bad, given them 15 years, one other key point before I show you the test results. A thermistor, because it has a
[11:52.590 --> 12:08.590]  big signal, can be measured with one single-ended channel. One, I'm going to put SE on here, single-ended channel. That's an
[12:08.590 --> 12:18.430]  inexpensive data logger channel, and we can do that because it has a big signal. PRTs have such a tiny signal, at the
[12:18.430 --> 12:32.550]  minimum we need to take two channels here on the data logger, but for the best accuracy, we need to have two differential channels, a four wire
[12:32.550 --> 12:42.470]  system to get the best accuracy. Not only is the sensor more expensive, but all those channels on the data logger add cost to the system. Each
[12:42.470 --> 12:55.030]  channel on a data logger can be several hundred dollars, and this takes four of them compared to one up here. That's an overlook cost in this thing, is the cost of these
[12:55.030 --> 13:15.030]  channels. Alright, now what do these do? Here is 96 cycles, we went from minus 20 to plus 60, C, 96 times up and down. The thermistors are shown here in blue, the yellow
[13:15.030 --> 13:32.110]  beads, the PRTs are shown here in red. Let's see if we can get rid of that, there we go. These are shown here in red. Here's the data. The thermistors had a slightly bigger error in the
[13:32.110 --> 13:44.270]  beginning, and you can see over the course of the test, the number of cycles, they drifted more. These are offset errors, right here, so we can take those out and say,
[13:44.390 --> 14:12.950]  okay, if they all read perfectly, what would this graph look like? So we normalize this, and the thermistors are rock-solid, they're better than the class A PRTs. So for less money, you can get greater accuracy with this yellow bead thermistor. It doesn't mean all thermistors are better, just this one that has the epoxy coating on it, which is the one that
[14:13.110 --> 14:39.830]  Apogee has selected to sell. So now let's take a look, remember I said there was better PRTs? Now let's take a look at some 110th DIN PRTs. How did they do? These are higher quality, even more cycles. 10 months, 584 cycles up and down, up and down.
[14:39.830 --> 15:09.790]  The class, the 110th DIN PRTs were much better. This is rock-solid. These are the two replicates, right here. Those were rock-solid in this test. So it's possible to get good PRTs, you just have to pay more for them. So how did these compare to the thermistors? Here's 12 replicate thermistors against those, 584 cycles, and we keep going. We normalize them to zero here.
[15:10.310 --> 15:38.230]  Because there's some offset and the errors are less than 5 100ths of a degree C in drift of these sensors over time. So this is a more comprehensive test to help convince us that these yellow bead thermistors were just rock-solid. So let's look at an application. How good do you need air temperature and how would these perform in a system in a severe climate?
[15:38.710 --> 15:58.150]  It turns out we're in Logan, Utah. So we look out the window at mountains that are 10,000 feet. We're a little under 5,000 feet in our valley. Some of those mountain climates have very severe weather and one of the most famous for severe weather is a place called Peter Sinks.
[15:58.150 --> 16:27.270]  It's in a little bowl high up in the mountains. Cold air collects in this sink. It gets extremely cold. Hot in the summer, cold in the winter. How cold does it get? Look at this. 1985 we recorded minus 69.3 Fahrenheit up there, minus 56.3 C. This record was the lowest temperature for Utah. The record all-time low.
[16:27.590 --> 16:47.430]  And it was the second coldest temperature ever recorded in the continental United States. Oh great, second. What was the coldest? Rogers Pass in Montana, 69.7 Fahrenheit. This is 1954. So these are long-term records. Look at the difference.
[16:47.430 --> 17:13.670]  Here's our second place, minus 69.3. There's the all-time record 69.7. You tell me how much accuracy of sensors matters in extreme cases when we got second place by four-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit. That's two-tenths of a degree Celsius. Measurements matter when you're going for an all-time record.
[17:14.630 --> 17:36.790]  So at this site we have set up a weather station that continuously records temperatures and we've done test runs with the Apogee sensors up here to see how they do. Let's take a look at that site. Here's the site. This is practically summer up there. The snow really does melt off in the summer but it's a remote, austere site.
[17:37.750 --> 18:03.110]  Right here is a multi-plate shield that are commonly used on these and then here is the Apogee aspirated shield. So what we're going to look at is just the shield now and we're going to take a look right up the bottom of this like we're laying on the snow looking at the bottom.
[18:03.430 --> 18:27.990]  This is what the bottom looks like and this is the sensors inside of here. Two yellow beads and two PRTs both in the same shield so we can do a rigorous replicate comparison of accuracy and stability over a long term in this because they're both fan aspirated they should both be accurate. How'd they do?
[18:28.950 --> 18:54.310]  Well first of all how severe was the weather? This is a year, almost a year of weather. Up and down, day and night, day and night. This has huge swings, hot in the day, cold at night. Here's last winter, this is two winters ago. We didn't get the all-time record right. We got to almost to minus 40 degrees C. Remember the all-time record is minus 56 but it still got cold.
[18:54.310 --> 19:20.390]  Then up and down and finally summer came and not many nights it doesn't freeze up there. It's a cold place but these swings are enormous so it's sensors get a beating up there. What's the data look like? Here's that same graph with cycling, temperature difference between the two replicate thermistors. Look at the scale on this.
[19:20.390 --> 19:45.430]  Plus or minus 1C right on top of each other. Here's the PRTs. They're also very good. Plus or minus zero. Now focus in on this right here, this little spike. This happened in the spring. This is classic when it happens when a speck of moisture gets in there. Could have been even an insect and it got on one of the sensors and cooled it off.
[19:45.430 --> 20:12.950]  This is the average of the two and it's only less than one degree C but this is not measurement error. This is just something momentarily getting in the shield and cooling off the sensor. You can imagine if you put an ice cube on a sensor for a fraction of a second you'd easily get that. Even a wet sponge you'd easily get that. We're not worried about that. What we're worried about is this stability. Let's zoom in on this just a bit now.
[20:13.030 --> 20:42.230]  Just those two graphs, big, even a narrower scale. Plus or minus 0.4 degrees C. The replicate thermistors are very close to each other. The replicate PRTs are close to each other. These are differences from the mean of all four sensors. Nobody was off by more than about 0.1 and they were rock-solid over this year period of this test.
[20:42.710 --> 21:02.950]  The thermistors were every bit as good as the PRTs for stability. There's one other concern. Remember we talked about small is better and the smaller the sensor the closer it stays to air temperature. These are smaller than these. It's a round end.
[21:02.950 --> 21:25.030]  Remember in our show and tell here. That's not much difference in size but if the sun is shining on these, this big stainless steel one is going to heat up more than that tiny little bead. These are also inside an aspirated shield so the sun shouldn't matter.
[21:25.190 --> 21:51.190]  What happened? Some reflected light bounced off the snow and heated these up inside the screen. Here's what happened. Compared to the mean of the thermistors, the PRTs heated up from solar radiation. It wasn't big, it was 0.1 degrees C, but because they were bigger they were less accurate.
[21:51.910 --> 22:16.870]  So this is two examples of the same thing. The two replicate PRTs, both of them heated up. This is why we really recommend using this Apogee Yellowbead thermistor in these applications even inside of an aspirated shield where they're protected. It saves a lot of money.
[22:17.350 --> 22:35.110]  If you really need good accuracy put in two replicate yellow beads and if they don't read the same you need to go out and check the site. You got a problem. Two replicate yellow beads is far less expensive than one more expensive PRT.
[22:35.110 --> 22:50.150]  Here's the setup right here. So with that we're going to conclude this session on temperature sensors and we'll follow up on temperature shields in another talk. Thanks for listening. We'll see you again soon.
