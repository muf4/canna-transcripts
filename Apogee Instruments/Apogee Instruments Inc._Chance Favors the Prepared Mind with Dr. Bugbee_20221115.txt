[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  So today I want to share a talk with you that I recently did at the annual
[00:08.160 --> 00:14.960]  meeting of the American Society of Agronomy which was in Baltimore, Maryland.
[00:14.960 --> 00:23.800]  I was asked by the Society to give a talk on serendipity in science, how that
[00:23.800 --> 00:31.200]  occurs, how things, how we, accidental discoveries in science and how they
[00:31.200 --> 00:36.520]  impact our science. And of course my media thought when they asked me to give
[00:36.520 --> 00:40.160]  a talk about serendipity in sciences, so what do you, would you think my whole
[00:40.160 --> 00:47.200]  career was just based on luck? That luck? That's why I'm here talking? And but they
[00:47.200 --> 00:51.800]  said no, no, no, we don't think that, but, but you've had some significant
[00:51.800 --> 00:59.400]  discoveries and we'd like you to talk about how those came about. So I decided
[00:59.400 --> 01:06.360]  to title my talk, Chance Favors the Prepared Mind. And I've always loved this
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.560]  quote. I first read it when I was in graduate school and I thought I want to
[01:10.560 --> 01:15.600]  dedicate my career to having a prepared mind so when those chances come along
[01:15.720 --> 01:23.400]  they're a big deal. So this, this seems to make pretty intuitive sense but what's
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.600]  a prepared mind really mean? You know an analogy that I thought of is what if we
[01:29.600 --> 01:36.360]  said chance favors the prepared athlete? Well that would make perfect sense.
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.120]  Athletes spend a long time preparing their minds and bodies for that one
[01:41.240 --> 01:46.640]  catch in some great game, but that wasn't luck, that was a lot of skill
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.960]  honed by years of practice. The same principles relate to this with
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.960]  scientists. The prepared mind means learning all the principles of your
[01:57.960 --> 02:04.400]  discipline, the equations that make up your discipline, the theory, the models,
[02:04.560 --> 02:11.480]  the literature in your discipline. It means really becoming a true expert in
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.120]  your discipline. That's what prepared mind means and then when you come along
[02:17.120 --> 02:24.960]  and see the odd things you're prepared to say hmm that could be something right
[02:24.960 --> 02:30.600]  there and you follow it up. Lesser people might say now that was bad data just
[02:30.640 --> 02:37.360]  forget it and move on. So this quote came from Louis Pasteur. He lived in the
[02:37.360 --> 02:42.840]  1800s. He was a great philanthropist. Everybody knows about him. The germ
[02:42.840 --> 02:48.680]  theory of disease came from Pasteur. He was he was always working with sterile
[02:48.680 --> 02:56.400]  systems. It's amazing stories of his life, but when he wrote about this, he got the
[02:56.400 --> 03:03.040]  Nobel Prize. When he wrote about this he didn't have five succinct words to
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.920]  describe this principle. Here's what he wrote. Well even before I get to what he
[03:08.920 --> 03:15.200]  wrote, let's take a look at what a prepared mind might be. Here's some
[03:15.200 --> 03:22.640]  data right so this is an X plot, an input variable, here's Y, a plant response. You
[03:22.640 --> 03:30.240]  get data like this. Now we would normally say the data is like that. This
[03:30.240 --> 03:36.640]  is a common principle for a lot of things. The more you give X, this is
[03:36.640 --> 03:42.320]  nonlinear. You make measurements, you get this point right here. The first
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.680]  inclination is that must be bad just throw it out, but you measured it. What
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.120]  what happened with that? Let's see if I can get back to this. You measure it, just
[03:52.120 --> 03:58.520]  throw it out. We have statistical principles that say this is so far off
[03:58.520 --> 04:04.640]  the line just forget about it. You can throw it out, but there's an example
[04:04.640 --> 04:10.320]  of something that might be real. Let's take this out here for a second, that
[04:10.320 --> 04:18.240]  little line right here, and we're gonna go back to this. Now some people might
[04:18.400 --> 04:25.280]  take this and they have a high-speed computer and they'll attempt to fit this
[04:25.280 --> 04:31.160]  with a tenth order polynomial that looks like that. And now you got to come
[04:31.160 --> 04:36.000]  up with the principle that says right here there's a big inhibitory effect of
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.760]  X on Y. So just that simple data set alone gives you a lot of examples of the
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.960]  challenges we go through and we make good measurements, very careful
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.240]  measurements, and we're sorting good data from bad data and and looking for
[04:51.240 --> 04:58.360]  those anomalies that lead to great breakthroughs. Pasteur didn't say these
[04:58.360 --> 05:05.600]  five concise words. Here's what he originally wrote for his Nobel Prize.
[05:07.040 --> 05:12.800]  In fields of observation chance favors the prepared mind. But look at this.
[05:12.840 --> 05:19.680]  This is true in all fields, not just in observation. So we can edit that out.
[05:19.680 --> 05:24.360]  Chance favors only the prepared mind. And not only that, we don't need the word
[05:24.360 --> 05:29.360]  only. We edit that out too. Now we get to his quote. So Pasteur, like a lot of
[05:29.360 --> 05:34.400]  people, had good editors as stuff to make the concise statements. And that's
[05:34.440 --> 05:43.200]  part of science, the conciseness that leads to new breakthroughs. So we often
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.280]  think scientists must say when they have a great through they say, ah, eureka, I
[05:47.280 --> 05:53.520]  found it. But that's really not how science works. You rarely get to
[05:53.520 --> 05:59.400]  something you expected. The most common phrase is, hmm, that's funny. And that's
[05:59.560 --> 06:04.480]  this part that leads to these great breakthroughs. This came from Isaac
[06:04.480 --> 06:08.880]  Asimov, this quote. And here's a book that I've had on my shelf for years,
[06:08.880 --> 06:14.400]  Serendipity, Accidental Discoveries in Science. And this is loaded with examples
[06:14.400 --> 06:20.120]  of unhappy accidents that occurred in science. It's a it's an interesting book.
[06:20.120 --> 06:29.160]  It's still in print. So let's let's take a deeper look at this. In 1963, science
[06:29.280 --> 06:34.280]  magazine had an editorial and the conclusion of the editorial was
[06:34.280 --> 06:40.680]  serendipity is not a substitute for hard work. And that's a gold standard in this.
[06:40.680 --> 06:46.360]  They were being criticized, you should just fund the scientists that are lucky.
[06:46.360 --> 06:50.920]  There's not lucky scientists. There's ones that have hard work and they have
[06:50.920 --> 06:56.040]  prepared minds. So they were pushing back on this. There's an old phrase, the
[06:56.040 --> 07:02.720]  harder I work, the luckier I get. Yeah, great. But look, hard work is in here.
[07:02.720 --> 07:10.280]  Work is in here. Work is something you don't like doing. And in order to do a
[07:10.280 --> 07:15.480]  lot of it and feel good about it and be creative, you got to do the stuff you
[07:15.480 --> 07:22.000]  like doing. You have to like what you do. So I always say just this isn't work. This
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.720]  is something I enjoy and work is something I don't enjoy. That's one of
[07:27.720 --> 07:33.760]  the keys to doing a lot of something and then being able to find the pick out the
[07:33.760 --> 07:42.760]  happy accidents that occur. So let's get rid of this. Here's another big thing
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.040]  about statistics. Statistics is not going to lead us to great breakthroughs. It
[07:48.080 --> 07:52.200]  helps us determine mathematical probabilities. But I love this quote, if
[07:52.200 --> 07:56.400]  your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.
[07:56.400 --> 08:02.240]  This came from Ernest Rutherford, Nobel Prize in Chemistry. You can believe he
[08:02.240 --> 08:06.480]  wanted clean experiments where we didn't need a lot of reps and he didn't need a
[08:06.480 --> 08:11.520]  lot of statistics to sort out his results. And certainly in our research
[08:11.520 --> 08:16.960]  here, we try to do simple clean experiments so we don't need a lot of
[08:16.960 --> 08:26.880]  replicates. So the next section of this talk is about this intersection between
[08:26.880 --> 08:34.880]  theory and measurement and we get to a point right there. Knowledge is really
[08:34.880 --> 08:41.000]  the extent to which theory agrees with measurements. Now theory is another term
[08:41.080 --> 08:47.240]  for models and models are equations and if models predict something and that's
[08:47.240 --> 08:53.680]  what we measure, we get confident that we have it right. This is in this room up
[08:53.680 --> 09:01.520]  here on a board by our clock to keep people thinking about this. And really
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.600]  this quote in here says, never believe a measurement unless it can be
[09:06.600 --> 09:13.000]  substantiated with theory. And conversely, the degree of confidence we
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.160]  can have is the degree to which these two things agree. So theory is what you
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.200]  learn in school, theory is what prepares your mind, and measurements what you do
[09:22.200 --> 09:26.840]  in the lab and you look for when they converge. Now to pick out these
[09:26.840 --> 09:32.080]  serendipitous measurements, we need wisdom. So it's a three-way interaction
[09:32.240 --> 09:39.040]  between all three of those things that gets us there. So here's another quote
[09:39.040 --> 09:46.320]  that's just striking. Everybody believes a measurement except the person that
[09:46.320 --> 09:50.240]  made it. Now the person that made it knows how hard it was to make that
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.320]  measurement and they're not sure they got it right, but everybody else thinks, oh no
[09:54.320 --> 10:00.360]  no, it's measured, it's fine, it's the gold standard. The corollary to this is
[10:00.360 --> 10:06.120]  nobody believes a model except the person who made the model. And the
[10:06.120 --> 10:09.800]  modelers are always saying, I have a model, I have a model, look it's right. And
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.640]  people say, no no no. So the bottom line of this, we should believe measurements less
[10:16.640 --> 10:23.000]  and we should believe models more. They put equal weight on both of these to
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.120]  guide us. Now the place where I think, where I think much of this came from is
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.080]  back to the future, where they're making a lot of measurements to go into the
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.080]  future and they make a lot of models back and forth. So it's a nice corollary
[10:37.080 --> 10:51.480]  to this quote. So let's see, we'd get this off the slide. The analogy I have used to
[10:51.480 --> 10:57.280]  emphasize this link between theory and measurement is getting to the top of a
[10:57.320 --> 11:04.680]  house with two ladders and the rules of science say you can only have one foot
[11:04.680 --> 11:11.480]  on each ladder. And one ladder is measurement, one ladder is theory, and you
[11:11.480 --> 11:16.120]  get to the top of the house fastest when you put one foot on one rung and back
[11:16.120 --> 11:24.120]  and forth and back and forth and up you go on the ladder. If you try to do only
[11:24.120 --> 11:27.560]  measurements you maybe could get there hopping on one foot on the ladder but
[11:27.560 --> 11:31.480]  it'd be awfully hard. In only theory hopping on one foot would be awfully hard.
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.440]  Now another part of this is if you want to be really safe you should tie your
[11:37.440 --> 11:43.160]  ladders together so that you, the whole thing is more safe and that's a, that's a
[11:43.160 --> 11:47.800]  good because we want to link theory and measurement intimately back and forth.
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.720]  Here's some examples of that. Here's theory, there's measurement. Let's take
[11:52.760 --> 11:59.760]  these off of here. Back and forth, back and forth, and here we go in, up, up, up,
[11:59.760 --> 12:09.040]  up, out. But boy they're far apart and this takes a while to get up there. What
[12:09.040 --> 12:15.240]  if we more intimately link them, now we have faster progress because they're
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.480]  closer together back and forth and then finally they become one in the same, in
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.800]  the same person. Theory, measurement, evaluate, that makes for excellent
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.360]  progress. I want to further emphasize this with some pictures. Here's theory.
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.760]  Albert Einstein, all he ever needed to do research was a box of chalk and, and it's
[12:35.760 --> 12:40.400]  wonderful. I'd like to be his department head just, I'll be needing another box of
[12:40.400 --> 12:45.520]  chalk this year for my research budget. Here's our theory. We do all kinds of
[12:45.560 --> 12:51.120]  empirical replicates in the field that look like this. Theory and measurement,
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.520]  excellence emerges from continuous coupling. We move these together, it's
[12:56.520 --> 13:01.440]  continuously coupled and we make faster progress. We sort out the bad data from
[13:01.440 --> 13:09.840]  the good and we improve our models by doing this. So often in research we get
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.160]  this out of balance and we do a lot of empirical measurements and we have
[13:15.200 --> 13:23.000]  very inadequate theory to explain them. In some labs the reverse is true and we
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.600]  have a lot of theory but not very much data. This often happens in climate
[13:28.600 --> 13:35.040]  science where we have a lot of models, we rely heavily on models and just a little
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.560]  bit of data. But in both of these cases it's out of balance and it doesn't lead
[13:39.640 --> 13:46.720]  to the fastest progress in science. Now let's switch to a little bit of data
[13:46.720 --> 13:53.840]  that we have here in our lab. This is a graph of the colors of light at night
[13:53.840 --> 14:01.640]  and how they affect flowering in cannabis. So we always say a green light
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.440]  is safe. If you want to work at night always use green light because that has
[14:06.480 --> 14:16.320]  no effect on plants. Don't use red or blue. This is days after start and flower
[14:16.320 --> 14:23.080]  diameter. So the steeper the line the faster the plants flowered. So if they
[14:23.080 --> 14:30.680]  were completely dark they flowered fast. If we gave them blue light and I can
[14:30.720 --> 14:38.680]  show that in blue on here, they flowered equally fast. So in this study blue light
[14:38.680 --> 14:43.240]  was safe, no effect. Look at red light. Red light's the opposite of green.
[14:43.240 --> 14:52.120]  Flowering was inhibited by red light right here and the flower diameters were
[14:52.120 --> 14:57.300]  smaller because the plants perceived red light at night. Here's the point, look at
[14:57.300 --> 15:05.740]  the green. Green in this study was just as effective as red. So it's not the case
[15:05.740 --> 15:11.700]  that green light is a safe light. Plants perceive the green light. How can that be?
[15:11.700 --> 15:16.180]  If plants reflect green light how can that be so potent? That's why we think
[15:16.180 --> 15:21.300]  that's safe because they just reflect it. I'm gonna put up here a diagram of how
[15:21.420 --> 15:27.660]  light penetrates plant leaves. Green light is reflected but that also means
[15:27.660 --> 15:35.540]  it penetrates deeper into leaves. This is a diagram of the cross-section of a leaf.
[15:35.540 --> 15:41.140]  Here's the top of the leaf, here's the bottom of the leaf, and this distance is
[15:41.140 --> 15:48.020]  just like one millimeter. It's way blown up. Blue and green are absorbed very
[15:48.140 --> 15:54.780]  quickly in the surface layer. The green photons hit and they bounce around and
[15:54.780 --> 16:00.260]  they penetrate the leaf and this means the green photons get to the site of
[16:00.260 --> 16:05.700]  perception of the light, which in this case is the phytochrome molecule.
[16:05.700 --> 16:11.460]  Even though those photons don't have such a big effect, they're not zero and
[16:11.700 --> 16:17.580]  they're getting to the site of perception. This only came from our
[16:17.580 --> 16:21.700]  understanding of principles. We said, well this can't be correct.
[16:21.700 --> 16:27.180]  Just throw the green light data out. No, it led to a new principle and here's the
[16:27.180 --> 16:32.940]  paper that resulted from it. Improving the predictive value of phytochrome
[16:32.940 --> 16:38.700]  photoequilibrium in consideration of spectral distortion in a leaf.
[16:38.700 --> 16:45.940]  This data led to this paper. Now, having said this, green light is still the best
[16:45.940 --> 16:51.340]  light to use because our eyes are really sensitive to green light.
[16:51.340 --> 16:55.740]  Use green light if you have to work at night, but try to use a minimal amount of
[16:55.740 --> 17:02.660]  green light. It is not completely safe. Let's take another example. This is
[17:02.660 --> 17:13.180]  weighing lysimeters in our greenhouse. Go back to this. These are load cells.
[17:13.180 --> 17:17.380]  We weigh plants. We measure transpiration with this. Here's a growth chamber and
[17:17.380 --> 17:22.740]  here's this. There's cotton on these and corn on these chambers. So we can make very
[17:22.740 --> 17:27.340]  accurate measurements of how open the stomates are and how much transpiration
[17:27.340 --> 17:33.740]  there is. Let's look at the data. This is day and night, two days. Transpiration
[17:33.740 --> 17:40.020]  rate, which is right here in purple. Now that is, and let's see if I can show this
[17:40.020 --> 17:48.260]  in purple right here. It's low at night, not zero. Here's zero right there. High in
[17:48.260 --> 17:54.860]  the day, low at night, high in the day. This is our measurements just like that.
[17:54.900 --> 18:01.620]  Stomatal conductance, that's how open the stomates are. That's shown in green.
[18:01.620 --> 18:08.820]  The stomates open in the day and close at night, but look, they're not completely
[18:08.820 --> 18:17.580]  closed at night and this number right here is about 0.4 open and wide open and
[18:17.900 --> 18:25.580]  the day is about 0.9. So in this data, the stomates are about half as open at
[18:25.580 --> 18:32.740]  night as they are in the day. The reason this is higher than this is it's very
[18:32.740 --> 18:41.380]  humid at night and the leaves are cooler so that transpiration should be
[18:41.380 --> 18:46.780]  much less because there's not much of a driving gradient. Conductance is the
[18:46.780 --> 18:53.180]  ratio of driving gradient to transpiration, but this is remarkable.
[18:53.180 --> 19:00.060]  Now this data was collected some years ago in cotton, but we know this also
[19:00.060 --> 19:05.380]  happens in cannabis, which is a very big deal because we have a lot of flux of
[19:05.380 --> 19:10.540]  water at night when the stomates are supposed to be closed and they're open.
[19:10.540 --> 19:15.060]  We have to run dehumidifiers or we get plant disease. All the textbooks say
[19:15.100 --> 19:22.100]  stomates close at night and that sentence in textbooks is just wrong.
[19:22.100 --> 19:30.780]  Except if we give the plants some water stress, a minor water stress, they quickly
[19:30.780 --> 19:35.300]  start to close their stomates at night. In this same data, had we stressed
[19:35.300 --> 19:40.660]  these plants a little bit with water, now the conductance would be down here. It
[19:40.700 --> 19:46.540]  looks like this. So if plants, like many of our cannabis, if they're grown with no
[19:46.540 --> 19:52.140]  water stress, they don't close their stomates at night. It's a big, big deal.
[19:52.300 --> 19:59.580]  Look at this curve. This was in electric lights. Let's get rid of these lines here.
[19:59.580 --> 20:07.340]  This is in electric lights and I'm gonna have to do that. There we go.
[20:07.460 --> 20:14.700]  The lights in this were a square wave. They came on and looked like that. This
[20:14.700 --> 20:19.180]  is not sunlight. It's an electric light. All of our principles say that
[20:19.180 --> 20:24.540]  transpiration rate should follow the light. It should go up and high and come
[20:24.540 --> 20:29.900]  down and instead it's a curve in here and it happened every day. It should have
[20:29.900 --> 20:35.260]  been a square. It's a curve in here. Our models don't predict that. The
[20:35.300 --> 20:41.180]  measurements in here didn't match the models. When we got this data, we very
[20:41.180 --> 20:52.900]  quickly went to multiple plants. Let's go right here and looked at this. Here's a
[20:52.900 --> 20:59.180]  square wave of light. All plants do this. In the afternoon, it's like they get
[20:59.180 --> 21:03.660]  tired and they, this is transpiration rate, or this is stomatal
[21:03.660 --> 21:08.340]  conductance. They start to close their stomates in the afternoon and they don't
[21:08.340 --> 21:13.700]  even open them till about 11 o'clock in the morning. It's just remarkable that
[21:13.700 --> 21:17.660]  plants do this and it took controlled environments to be able to study this.
[21:17.660 --> 21:22.380]  This has, now look at this, here's these lines are close to zero down here
[21:22.380 --> 21:28.540]  because the plants got a little bit of water stress. This has big implications
[21:28.540 --> 21:33.500]  for designing air conditioning systems and for humidity and disease control.
[21:33.500 --> 21:38.740]  These stomates are wide open in the middle one-third of the day, but it takes
[21:38.740 --> 21:42.380]  them a few hours to get there and a few, and they close their stomates for a few
[21:42.380 --> 21:50.420]  hours in the afternoon. Now let's go back to another fascinating thing about this.
[21:50.500 --> 22:00.900]  This is a well-watered cotton plant and a two water stress cotton plants. This
[22:00.900 --> 22:07.060]  same thing happens in cannabis. Here's the opening, took a long time to open and
[22:07.060 --> 22:12.300]  then they started to gradually close. There's night right there, but look at
[22:12.300 --> 22:16.620]  these drought stress plants. They also take a while to open, they stay open,
[22:16.620 --> 22:21.100]  maybe about half. This is a measurement of how drought stress they are, but look
[22:21.100 --> 22:26.620]  what happens here. They go nuts, there's noise, that is not noise. The whole plant
[22:26.620 --> 22:31.540]  is cycling for water. It opens its stomates, oh we overshot and it closed
[22:31.540 --> 22:37.180]  them and open, closed, open and closed. We've seen this repeatedly in plants. This
[22:37.180 --> 22:42.140]  is anomalous data, this is the kind of data you go, huh that's funny, and then
[22:42.140 --> 22:47.140]  you find out you can repeat it. This has big implications for design of
[22:47.140 --> 22:52.340]  controlled environments where we spend a lot of money taking the humidity out of
[22:52.340 --> 23:04.260]  the air. Let's get rid of those, these, those lines are off. Now let's move to
[23:04.260 --> 23:10.460]  another huge area for us here in the crop physiology lab and my colleagues.
[23:10.460 --> 23:16.300]  This is far-red photons, you can just barely see far-red right here. We call
[23:16.300 --> 23:20.420]  these the forgotten photons because they're on the edge of our vision, we can
[23:20.420 --> 23:26.500]  barely see them. We've done a lot of work with far-red photons and their
[23:26.500 --> 23:32.260]  photosynthetic value. This work was done with my long-term colleague Mark
[23:32.260 --> 23:38.140]  Van Aersol at the University of Georgia. He was here last summer with us,
[23:38.140 --> 23:44.460]  recorded videos with us. He's just been a joy to work with. He's now got an
[23:44.460 --> 23:50.940]  endowed chair position at the University of Georgia and Shu-Yung Zhen, who is a
[23:50.940 --> 23:57.700]  very talented scientist. She got her PhD with Mark, then she came to Utah to work
[23:57.700 --> 24:03.340]  with me for a postdoc. She is now an assistant professor at Texas A&M
[24:03.340 --> 24:12.660]  University. Together, the three of us have published six, seven papers on this
[24:12.660 --> 24:17.820]  and I want to review this evidence because it has the potential to be a
[24:17.820 --> 24:27.220]  profound implications for all of plant biology. Here's lettuce, no far-red and
[24:27.220 --> 24:32.820]  10% of the photons is far-red. Now you don't have to be a rocket scientist to
[24:32.820 --> 24:38.340]  see those far-red photons are doing amazing things to this plant. Some of
[24:38.340 --> 24:43.020]  this is due to what we call a shade avoidance response. They think they're in
[24:43.020 --> 24:46.500]  shade so they just spread out. They spread their leaves bigger. That's not
[24:46.500 --> 24:51.580]  surprising, we've known that forever, but with careful measurements of
[24:51.580 --> 24:56.980]  photosynthesis, we have shown that some of this profound effect is also due to
[24:56.980 --> 25:03.100]  far-red photons. That is a big deal because for years and years we've said
[25:03.100 --> 25:10.260]  far-red photons do not cause photosynthesis. So it's an amazing claim
[25:10.260 --> 25:17.100]  to say they do. When we have amazing claims, we should always fall back on
[25:17.100 --> 25:25.580]  this mantra. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Now this was
[25:25.620 --> 25:32.900]  popularized by Carl Sagan in Cosmos, but this is an old saying. So now what I want
[25:32.900 --> 25:39.420]  to do is show you the extraordinary proof for far-red and photosynthesis.
[25:39.420 --> 25:47.380]  This is a very concise summary, but this started in 2017 with Journal
[25:47.380 --> 25:53.100]  of Plant Physiology. Mark and Shu Yong in Georgia studied the light reactions of
[25:53.100 --> 25:58.580]  photosynthesis and very clearly showed these far-red photons had a beneficial
[25:58.580 --> 26:03.420]  effect. They followed it up with laser diodes a year later, published another
[26:03.420 --> 26:10.380]  paper, Physiologica Plantarum, showing that the wavelengths of far-red up to
[26:10.380 --> 26:18.660]  about 730 nanometers were clearly helpful in the light reactions. Then
[26:18.740 --> 26:25.420]  after that Shu Yong came here to our lab in Utah where we have a whole series of
[26:25.420 --> 26:31.020]  whole plant gas exchange chambers so we can measure photosynthesis on whole
[26:31.020 --> 26:36.740]  canopies. Shu Yong and I published a paper in 2020 in Plant Cell and
[26:36.740 --> 26:42.100]  Environment, one of our top journals. Far-red photons have equivalent
[26:42.100 --> 26:48.380]  efficiency to traditional photosynthetic photons. Implications for redefining
[26:48.580 --> 26:54.820]  PAR. PAR is photosynthetically active radiation. We kept working on this in
[26:54.820 --> 27:00.700]  longer-term whole plant studies, published a paper on far-red photons in
[27:00.700 --> 27:06.180]  Frontiers in Plant Science, so yet more accumulating evidence, more papers, and
[27:06.180 --> 27:11.180]  now our colleagues are getting into this and there's other papers from other
[27:11.180 --> 27:17.340]  laboratories showing far-red photons have photosynthetic value. Note that all
[27:17.340 --> 27:24.260]  these papers are pretty recent papers. Now there's one thing that's critical
[27:24.260 --> 27:31.420]  here and that's the mechanism for this. Here's my diagram of how the light
[27:31.420 --> 27:38.580]  reactions of photosynthesis work. The Stark-Einstein loss is one photon
[27:38.580 --> 27:45.860]  excites one electron. This is how solar panels work, this is how photosynthesis
[27:45.900 --> 27:53.540]  work. A photon comes in, excites this guy, this electron gets excited and then it's
[27:53.540 --> 27:59.540]  passed down this mill, this turns, it makes ATP, makes energy, another photon
[27:59.540 --> 28:06.100]  hits this guy, boom, another electron's excited. So it's a two-stage process.
[28:06.100 --> 28:11.740]  Photosystem II comes first and photosystem I comes second. This is
[28:11.740 --> 28:16.700]  because we discovered this first and then we later found out there's two.
[28:16.700 --> 28:21.700]  Water gets split right here to oxygen but here's the key, we have known for a
[28:21.700 --> 28:29.620]  long time that far-red photons excite this photoreceptor in photosystem I and
[28:29.620 --> 28:36.700]  that is called the Emerson enhancement effect. It's been known for 50 years but
[28:36.700 --> 28:41.820]  it's been little studied until now when we got far-red LEDs we can do more
[28:41.820 --> 28:47.660]  rigorous studies of this. You can pause this and look at this diagram but this
[28:47.660 --> 28:53.580]  is the, this is electron transport in photosynthesis but simplified to show
[28:53.580 --> 29:00.340]  electrons getting excited. Takes four photons here and four
[29:00.500 --> 29:09.540]  photons here, either classic or far-red and it takes eight photons to get
[29:09.540 --> 29:18.940]  through the whole thing and fix CO2. So we have extended this now to plants in
[29:18.940 --> 29:26.080]  sunlight, not just electric light, sunlight and very recently, July 2022, we
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.960]  published a paper, Photosynthesis in Sun and Shade, Surprising Importance of
[29:30.960 --> 29:37.960]  Far-Red. This extends the work to sunlight and this is a new phytologist,
[29:37.960 --> 29:46.120]  is one of our top journals. We hope that this will help people understand the
[29:46.120 --> 29:50.480]  value of far-red light which is a very big deal in the world of cannabis
[29:50.480 --> 29:55.840]  because far-red photons are very efficient. They're long wavelength and
[29:55.840 --> 30:01.760]  they're very photosynthetically efficient. Here's the classic McCree
[30:01.760 --> 30:08.560]  curve for photosynthetic efficiency. It's the, our definitions, it cuts it off here.
[30:08.560 --> 30:12.640]  These photons are not very many and this curve is pretty accurate. They drop
[30:12.640 --> 30:18.840]  pretty fast. Over here we got 700. There's the classic definition. Now we add this
[30:18.840 --> 30:25.720]  recent work. This curve has a bulge over here so it looks like this and it
[30:25.720 --> 30:33.040]  goes to 750. The old definition is called PAR, photosynthetically active radiation.
[30:33.040 --> 30:39.280]  The new definition is called ePAR, extended photosynthetically active
[30:39.280 --> 30:46.280]  radiation. Apogee makes a sensor to measure ePAR and it's a better
[30:46.360 --> 30:55.480]  predictor of photosynthesis than the old PAR. So on a close here, this is a
[30:55.480 --> 31:01.800]  diagram done by a Utah artist, James Christensen, and I just love it. This is
[31:01.800 --> 31:09.680]  what we do in science to get serendipitous discoveries. We take our
[31:09.680 --> 31:15.040]  equipment out and sometimes their labs look like a bad day in a spaghetti
[31:15.120 --> 31:20.600]  factory around here. We take it out for a drive and test it and see what happens.
[31:20.600 --> 31:25.040]  And if you want to know how to get serendipity in science, build equipment,
[31:25.040 --> 31:31.040]  homemade, doesn't cost much, and take it out for a drive and see what happens and
[31:31.040 --> 31:37.120]  be prepared for anomalous findings. Thanks for listening. I hope this
[31:37.120 --> 31:43.360]  inspires you to go on and make a lot of measurements in science.
