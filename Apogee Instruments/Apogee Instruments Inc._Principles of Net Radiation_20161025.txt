[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and in today's video we'd
[00:06.240 --> 00:11.040]  like to talk about net radiation. I want to talk about the evolution of
[00:11.040 --> 00:17.040]  measurements and models to get to this key parameter and particularly the
[00:17.040 --> 00:21.040]  evolution of instruments. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some of the
[00:21.040 --> 00:27.160]  instruments that we've used to measure this. Here's why it's so important. We
[00:27.160 --> 00:31.120]  talk about it all the time, but not everybody has a good understanding of it.
[00:31.120 --> 00:36.880]  What we really want to know is how much to irrigate crops. There's no
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.440]  sensor to measure the flux of water vapor coming out of a crop directly. We
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.040]  always use indirect measurements. One of the most time-honored and classic
[00:47.040 --> 00:52.040]  measurements is to measure all the parameters. It's called the energy
[00:52.040 --> 00:55.440]  balance model. Measure all the parameters around it and then by
[00:55.440 --> 01:05.200]  subtraction get at transpiration. Here's what the model looks like. We have Rn,
[01:05.200 --> 01:15.960]  which is the thing we're talking about, equals lambda ET evapotranspiration plus
[01:15.960 --> 01:25.840]  h is sensible heat flux plus g is soil heat flux. These are classic symbols.
[01:25.840 --> 01:30.840]  You don't need to know them to understand net radiation, except we can do a
[01:30.840 --> 01:36.920]  reasonable job of measuring this and this. If we can measure net radiation
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.440]  by subtraction we can calculate the irrigation needs of a crop. This exact
[01:43.440 --> 01:50.840]  same simple model is used to determine global warming as well. Net radiation
[01:50.840 --> 01:55.600]  is the key driver. We really need accurate measurements of that, both for
[01:55.600 --> 02:03.560]  global warming issues and for crop irrigation needs. Let's take a look at
[02:03.560 --> 02:11.440]  the state-of-the-art of this about 10 years ago. 2005 the American Society for
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.160]  Civil Engineers came out with this book, Crop Evapotranspiration. This whole
[02:17.160 --> 02:24.840]  book is about the details of calculating that equation I just drew up there.
[02:24.840 --> 02:31.000]  In the beginning of the book it makes a statement, net radiation is difficult to
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.960]  measure. We recommend, this is a whole society, we recommend modeling net
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.320]  radiation from shortwave radiation, vapor pressure, and air temperature. This
[02:43.320 --> 02:51.320]  prediction is highly accurate. So we model a lot of things in science. We
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.200]  model the things we have trouble measuring, but we co-evolve measurements
[02:56.200 --> 03:02.680]  and models to get the most accurate analysis of everything we do. I want to
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.440]  look in a minute at where we've come since this statement was written in
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.080]  terms of instruments to measure net radiation. Now it's worth talking about
[03:11.080 --> 03:17.520]  the person that was the editor of this book. This is my friend and colleague
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.840]  Rick Allen, who was at Utah State University when he did all this work.
[03:21.840 --> 03:26.240]  He felt strongly about this because he saw a lot of people making bad
[03:26.240 --> 03:31.480]  measurements and he said you should model it. The model for this is
[03:31.960 --> 03:37.440]  not all that trivial. Here it is. Four components, some assumptions for these
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.600]  things. I'm not going to get into this model, but you can easily look at
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.240]  it in the book or you can pause on this slide and see all the components. So the
[03:46.240 --> 03:53.600]  model's got plenty of challenges as well. Now let's switch to measurements from
[03:53.600 --> 04:01.880]  the model. For this we fast forward four years to 2009. We did a massive
[04:01.880 --> 04:11.120]  field study of all the state-of-the-art net radiometers at the time and ran them
[04:11.120 --> 04:18.520]  for all summer long. Carefully cleaned the domes on a daily basis, leveled them.
[04:18.520 --> 04:24.960]  Here's all the instruments on our rig. One, two, three, four, five different
[04:24.960 --> 04:31.320]  types of instruments, three replicates of each. Here's the models and the number
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.200]  of outputs of each. Now before we get into the number of outputs, let's
[04:35.200 --> 04:41.560]  take a look at these. Now before I even show you these, we were studying net
[04:41.560 --> 04:46.880]  radiation well before this with state-of-the-art instruments at the time.
[04:46.960 --> 04:54.320]  Let me show you a very classic instrument. This one is in our museum now.
[04:54.320 --> 05:00.560]  We didn't use it in the study, but precision instruments used to come
[05:00.560 --> 05:08.400]  in wood boxes. This is a Swiss TECO net radiometer made by a Swiss company
[05:08.400 --> 05:14.600]  that was state-of-the-art for many years. Had to have a pump and inflate the domes,
[05:14.600 --> 05:21.320]  but it attempted to do shortwave and longwave measurements. It's a
[05:21.320 --> 05:26.960]  gorgeous instrument. It's since been replaced by several other instruments.
[05:26.960 --> 05:35.140]  Let's start at the low end. One of our instruments was this one. This is a
[05:35.140 --> 05:41.900]  radiation and energy balance systems model Q7.1. It attempts to get at
[05:41.900 --> 05:46.860]  radiation by, and all of these are net so they have an incoming and an outgoing,
[05:46.860 --> 05:52.220]  just by one simple blackbody that attempts to balance short and longwave
[05:52.220 --> 05:57.780]  radiation. This is the lowest cost of these instruments in the study. We're
[05:57.780 --> 06:03.820]  going to look at how this did. The next one up is a Kippenzonen NR light. You can
[06:03.820 --> 06:09.260]  see these fine plates on here. This again is similar doing net and longwave
[06:09.380 --> 06:15.420]  radiation with one single output from this. This is sensitive to wind. Wind
[06:15.420 --> 06:19.820]  cools it, so there's a wind correction for this, which we used in this study.
[06:19.820 --> 06:26.900]  Then we keep going up. This is the Huxaflux. You can see these on the
[06:26.900 --> 06:33.700]  screen, but now look at this instrument. Four separate sensors. Shortwave in,
[06:33.700 --> 06:40.540]  shortwave out, longwave in, longwave out. Four outputs. This is a considerable step
[06:40.540 --> 06:46.540]  up from these other instruments. Then finally the most expensive instrument
[06:46.540 --> 06:56.540]  of all is this Kippenzonen CNR1, which is shown in our pictures. We've got
[06:56.540 --> 07:07.460]  the CNR1 in this study. The CNR1 is the predecessor to this. That's a big
[07:07.460 --> 07:12.140]  heavy instrument right here. This came out after this study. It's a similar
[07:12.140 --> 07:17.220]  instrument, same company. It's a slight upgrade from that. Again it has four
[07:17.220 --> 07:23.780]  outputs. Two on the bottom, two on the top. How'd this come out?
[07:24.220 --> 07:31.820]  These are ranked from the bottom to the top in increasing order of price.
[07:31.820 --> 07:39.180]  Not terribly surprisingly, the accuracy went up with the increasing price.
[07:39.180 --> 07:44.860]  It's sort of like you get what you pay for. One of the absolutely clear
[07:44.860 --> 07:51.740]  things we found out about this was these instruments that had four outputs were
[07:51.740 --> 07:56.700]  fundamentally more accurate than the ones that only had one or two. Remember
[07:56.700 --> 08:01.380]  these instruments that just have two sides, I guess. They just give you one
[08:01.380 --> 08:07.380]  number and they attempt to separate shortwave fluxes and longwave fluxes.
[08:07.380 --> 08:13.540]  That's very challenging to do. It's easier to measure them separately.
[08:13.540 --> 08:20.860]  I want to put on this a green box around this because the two most expensive ones with
[08:20.860 --> 08:27.380]  four outputs were also the most accurate in this study. This was a lot
[08:27.380 --> 08:35.460]  of data, very carefully analyzed with multiple outputs. This is Mark Blondquist,
[08:35.460 --> 08:40.940]  who was the Apogee chief scientist that I've worked with for a long time on this,
[08:40.940 --> 08:46.180]  out here polishing and leveling these instruments in the field. At the end
[08:46.180 --> 08:50.540]  of the summer we published this in Agriculture and Forest Meteorology.
[08:50.540 --> 08:56.140]  You can go to this paper and see all the details of this study and the separate
[08:56.140 --> 09:00.180]  pros and cons. But in a nutshell the thing we came away from this was,
[09:00.180 --> 09:05.820]  four-way instruments are better than the lesser instruments.
[09:05.820 --> 09:14.740]  Now I said models might be better than measurements. Let's take a look at what
[09:14.740 --> 09:21.220]  we found from that. All of the instruments in this study were more
[09:21.220 --> 09:28.700]  accurate than the model. So we fundamentally disproved that statement
[09:28.700 --> 09:33.660]  that if the instruments are level and clean they're more accurate than the
[09:33.660 --> 09:39.500]  model. We ought to be measuring net radiation. The more expensive instruments
[09:39.500 --> 09:46.580]  were a lot more accurate. And how far off were they? Here's a simple graph out
[09:46.580 --> 09:52.300]  of many that we did. The model was 10% high compared to measurements. Here's the
[09:52.300 --> 10:01.260]  measurements. So 10% high, you know that's not that much. You're going to over water
[10:01.260 --> 10:07.020]  10%? Waste 10% to the water? Water is a really precious resource. I consider a
[10:07.020 --> 10:13.500]  10% error in this model to be pretty significant. And since this paper came
[10:13.500 --> 10:19.220]  out we have seen an enormous number of people switch to measuring this from
[10:19.220 --> 10:26.540]  modeling it. This was also published in another paper in Agricultural Water
[10:26.540 --> 10:31.100]  Management that really made the point that the measurements are better
[10:31.100 --> 10:36.300]  than the model. So our colleague Rick Allen was on record saying the model is
[10:36.300 --> 10:43.020]  the best. So guess what? Rick Allen, he became a co-author with us on this paper
[10:43.020 --> 10:49.700]  to make a very clear statement that the instruments are better. So that led to
[10:49.700 --> 10:56.300]  using instruments. Now we fast forward a few more years and because Apogee
[10:56.300 --> 11:03.420]  Instruments has a long history of measuring these parameters, Apogee
[11:03.460 --> 11:10.580]  started working on a new design for a net radiometer that incorporated four
[11:10.580 --> 11:18.500]  components into a single instrument and has an intermediate price. This is the
[11:18.500 --> 11:26.020]  design that Apogee has just recently released after four years of refinement
[11:26.020 --> 11:32.460]  and testing. It's a four component radiometer, shortwave in, shortwave out,
[11:32.500 --> 11:38.100]  longwave in, longwave out. This would take up, all of these instruments take up a
[11:38.100 --> 11:44.460]  lot of channels on a data acquisition system, which are precious channels
[11:44.460 --> 11:53.020]  that can be used for other things. So in this we made the output SDI 12 and it
[11:53.020 --> 11:59.260]  only takes up an SDI 12 channel. You can have multiple sensors in the same
[11:59.260 --> 12:04.860]  channel. So we consider this a pretty fundamental breakthrough in the world of
[12:04.860 --> 12:11.780]  measuring net radiation. It's small, easy to level, and has, I'm going to show you
[12:11.780 --> 12:17.580]  a minute, has very comparable accuracy to the highest end instruments that cost
[12:17.580 --> 12:25.820]  considerably more. One of the challenges of measuring radiation is condensation
[12:25.820 --> 12:37.020]  on sensors and snow on sensors. For that reason, the Huxaflux has a heater in it.
[12:37.020 --> 12:42.100]  It's a one and a half watt heater, so it's very significant. You have to have a
[12:42.100 --> 12:48.340]  big solar panel to run this heater. The Kip and Zonen also, for extra money, has
[12:48.340 --> 12:56.140]  this shield. Both of these high-end instruments have heaters to try and
[12:56.140 --> 13:01.180]  keep the instrument cleaned, so you make accurate measurements in all weather.
[13:01.180 --> 13:08.380]  The Apogee, because it's smaller, has tiny heaters in each of these four sensors to
[13:08.380 --> 13:12.540]  keep the domes clean. Let's look at what that looks like when we put these
[13:12.540 --> 13:18.780]  heaters in. Here's a winter day, a few years ago, frost in the morning. It didn't
[13:18.780 --> 13:23.340]  even snow, it's just frost is covering everything. The heaters are clean, and
[13:23.340 --> 13:27.740]  this is just a fraction of the power. This can easily be run from solar
[13:27.740 --> 13:33.220]  powered weather stations. We get a lot of pictures of this thing. Here's the same
[13:33.220 --> 13:38.660]  sensor, different angle showing the frost. This part doesn't need to be heated here,
[13:38.660 --> 13:44.020]  but these are nice and clean. That was another advance being able to heat this
[13:44.020 --> 13:52.140]  thing. How accurate is it? We have deployed this in the field. You can tell
[13:52.140 --> 13:56.020]  this is Utah because we have mountains in the background. Over a big alfalfa
[13:56.020 --> 14:05.020]  field, over 15 months, over a year, we compared them to the high-end Kip and
[14:05.060 --> 14:09.780]  Zonin. This is the most expensive of all the instruments, and we had three
[14:09.780 --> 14:17.260]  triplicate Apogee net radiometers on this tower. So through the winter, through
[14:17.260 --> 14:24.100]  the summer, comparing the accuracy. Here's the data. Here's the Kip and Zonin.
[14:24.100 --> 14:30.500]  Here's the Apogee. 15 months in the field, all of them track the Kip and Zonin
[14:30.500 --> 14:37.420]  very accurately. There's a few scattered points in here, and this is because
[14:37.420 --> 14:42.820]  something got on the sensor. Sometimes it got on the reference sensor and caused
[14:42.820 --> 14:49.820]  problems. This was not heated. This didn't have the heated shield, so there are
[14:49.820 --> 14:55.100]  times when this had an error. But the point of this is we're very pleased with
[14:55.100 --> 15:01.500]  this accuracy. It's been over a year since we've done that. So the take-home
[15:01.500 --> 15:10.380]  messages from all of this now are it's cost-effective to measure net radiation,
[15:10.380 --> 15:18.820]  as opposed to modeling it on all stations. And in the world of cost
[15:18.980 --> 15:25.460]  effectiveness, we feel that this Apogee net radiometer really fits a niche for
[15:25.460 --> 15:33.740]  very high accuracy and yet moderate cost. Thanks for listening. We'll talk to you
[15:33.740 --> 15:34.660]  again in another session.
