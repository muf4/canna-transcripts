[00:00.640 --> 00:06.960]  I'm Bruce Bugbee. Welcome to the next installment of a series of talks on
[00:06.960 --> 00:10.760]  principles of environmental measurement. Today we're going to talk about
[00:10.760 --> 00:16.560]  measurement of surface temperature. It's a very powerful and yet very challenging
[00:16.560 --> 00:24.160]  measurement. Many people make errors in this measurement. Our goal is to help you
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.720]  eliminate the errors. I'm joined in this effort by Mark Blomquist. He and I have
[00:28.720 --> 00:33.120]  worked together for more than 10 years trying to make accurate measurements of
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.880]  surface temperature. So you would think you could just take a sensor and put it
[00:38.880 --> 00:43.240]  on a surface and measure the surface temperature. But let's draw a little
[00:43.240 --> 00:49.200]  diagram to show the problems of that. So here's a surface. Now we take a sensor
[00:49.200 --> 00:54.520]  and put it on the surface right against to it. And this sensor has some
[00:54.520 --> 01:02.360]  wires coming out to go to a data logger. But as you can see this part of the
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.160]  sensor is touching the surface and measuring that. Over here we have air
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.240]  temperature touching all the rest of the sensor. So anytime you do this it's a
[01:15.240 --> 01:20.960]  combination of air temperature and surface temperature. Now this measurement
[01:20.960 --> 01:29.160]  gets better if you can get a very tiny sensor. It's better but it's still not
[01:29.160 --> 01:34.000]  the true surface temperature. It's always an average. And then people dig
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.240]  holes and puncture and put sensors in here and do things like that. Now
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.840]  you're measuring the surface plus the temperature behind the surface. So anytime
[01:44.840 --> 01:50.000]  you try and do this with a physical sensor you can never get the true
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.640]  surface temperature. That's why we use infrared sensors. And on this diagram I
[01:56.640 --> 02:04.080]  can draw a sensor like this which measure only the true radiation coming
[02:04.080 --> 02:10.480]  right from the surface. Whether it's a soil surface or a leaf surface or a road
[02:10.520 --> 02:17.560]  surface it's the true surface temperature. So let's take a look at some
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.880]  of the applications of this. The biggest use of Apogee sensors has been in
[02:23.880 --> 02:31.040]  agriculture for canopies to model conductance or irrigation scheduling of
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.280]  plants. Here's a couple of examples in the field. Here's the sensors pointing at
[02:35.280 --> 02:41.880]  a corn canopy. Here's one sensor over a small plant. This has allowed us to
[02:41.880 --> 02:47.640]  precision irrigate crops and determine the water status of plants, precision
[02:47.640 --> 02:53.080]  water stress plants, by measuring the canopy surface. This principle is real
[02:53.080 --> 02:58.680]  simple. Anything that's out of water heats up. If there's plenty of water you
[02:58.680 --> 03:02.960]  stay cool. We've joked about having a headband and a little
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.560]  infrared sensor pointed at your forehead like for runners to tell when they need
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.760]  to drink more water. If their forehead is heating up they need more water. It's the same
[03:11.760 --> 03:17.480]  thing with plants. So this is a huge application. Another application is
[03:17.480 --> 03:23.120]  predicting snow melt. Here's high in the mountains. The surface temperature
[03:23.120 --> 03:27.520]  changes rapidly. We want to know how fast that snow is melting and running down
[03:27.760 --> 03:34.440]  for agriculture. This is a huge area of research worldwide because tiny changes
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.680]  in global temperature mean that the snow melts a lot faster. We get the water
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.560]  earlier and we run out at the end of the summer. We really need to predict snow
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.360]  melt and there's many scientists around the world engaged in this. A third
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.400]  application is transportation. Icy road analysis. This is in Italy. Here's an
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.860]  apogee sensor off the corner of their truck telling when to put salt down. It's a
[04:00.860 --> 04:05.760]  real-time response telling when to put salt down on a field. You can also use
[04:05.760 --> 04:11.160]  these on a bridge. Danger, ice on bridge. That's determined by the
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.920]  temperature of the bridge. So there's a couple of applications. Now let's start
[04:15.920 --> 04:22.120]  looking at some of the key things. Emissivity. This is one of the most
[04:22.600 --> 04:30.120]  challenging things to understand. This is the fraction of radiation from a surface
[04:30.120 --> 04:38.920]  that gets to the sensor. Now let's back up and go to the fundamental equation
[04:38.920 --> 04:51.680]  that starts all this. This is E is for energy. I can write this E-N-E-R-G-Y equals a
[04:51.760 --> 04:58.680]  constant called sigma. This is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. You can look it up.
[04:58.680 --> 05:08.120]  This is multiplied by temperature. So this is pretty simple. If this is a
[05:08.120 --> 05:14.200]  constant, energy is proportional to temperature. If the temperature goes up,
[05:14.200 --> 05:21.000]  the energy goes up. This is fundamentally how we tell radiation from a surface is
[05:21.120 --> 05:27.400]  the energy emitted from it. Here's where it gets complicated. This is temperature
[05:27.400 --> 05:36.840]  in Kelvin. So a Kelvin temperature is about 300 in a room. A 1 degree C
[05:36.840 --> 05:45.040]  change is only one part in 300 parts. So it's a small change in energy, but this
[05:45.040 --> 05:52.800]  is one of the few things in science that is raised to the fourth power. Kelvin
[05:52.800 --> 05:57.720]  temperature raised to the fourth power is energy. So obviously this is a very
[05:57.720 --> 06:02.320]  nonlinear thing. We've got graphs on the website that show this exact
[06:02.320 --> 06:07.920]  relationship. So it gets more challenging. Let's touch this up a little bit. We have an
[06:07.920 --> 06:18.760]  equal sign here. This is only true for an object that is infinitely black and it
[06:18.760 --> 06:26.160]  radiates all of its energy to the surface. A third parameter, I've hardly
[06:26.160 --> 06:33.880]  got room for it, but you get the idea, is emissivity. This is a number that ranges
[06:33.880 --> 06:42.200]  from 0 to 1 and it's a multiplier times this whole thing. So we need to know
[06:42.200 --> 06:47.520]  emissivity of the surface. That's characteristic of the surface. Then we put
[06:47.520 --> 06:54.240]  this constant in, this sigma, and then we solve based on the energy. We solve for
[06:54.240 --> 07:00.960]  the temperature of the surface. This is called the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
[07:00.960 --> 07:07.000]  Stefan came up with it, Stefan added to it. It's fundamental to all radiation
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.680]  physics. You don't need to know this law to use them, but it helps to understand
[07:12.680 --> 07:18.320]  the principles, particularly this idea of emissivity. So let's take a look at
[07:18.320 --> 07:26.720]  emissivity. To get accuracy we custom calibrate every sensor. This is
[07:26.720 --> 07:32.600]  twelve sensors in a complex oven that controls temperature and they're further
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.280]  controlled here. The sensor bodies are controlled at one temperature, the
[07:36.280 --> 07:40.280]  targets controlled at another temperature. Every single sensor is
[07:40.280 --> 07:47.240]  custom calibrated using this device. So if we know temperature we can get
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.440]  radiation, but when we point these at something we need to know that they're
[07:52.440 --> 07:56.440]  pointing at something very black. So let's take a look at how black that is.
[07:56.440 --> 08:02.960]  This is the errors by the way. They're specified at plus or minus 0.2 degrees.
[08:02.960 --> 08:09.680]  This is a typical twelve sensors. This two times the standard deviation is only
[08:09.680 --> 08:14.400]  0.12, so it's a generous spec to say they're plus or minus two. Look at the
[08:14.400 --> 08:24.320]  temperature range from minus 30 up to 65, 70 out here. So they're calibrated over a
[08:24.320 --> 08:30.400]  wide temperature range. This is replicate sensors on top of each other. So now let's
[08:30.400 --> 08:36.080]  take a look at that black body. Take the top off. This looks like a hole, right?
[08:36.080 --> 08:42.360]  This is not a hole. This is a cavity that's painted very flat black. It's a
[08:42.360 --> 08:46.800]  cone-shaped cavity and it looks like you could put your hand in it.
[08:46.800 --> 08:54.920]  That's what's called a black body. So a black body has an emissivity
[08:54.920 --> 09:04.240]  very close to 1.0. In fact nothing really can theoretically get to 0.0.
[09:04.240 --> 09:11.680]  So this black body is more like 0.999 and that's how we calibrate the
[09:11.680 --> 09:17.840]  sensors against this black body, keeping it purely black. So now let's go back to
[09:17.840 --> 09:23.680]  this concept of emissivity or forward to it. Here's a typical surface. I'm going to
[09:23.680 --> 09:30.920]  show you some emissivities in a minute. A plant canopy can have an emissivity
[09:30.920 --> 09:38.320]  very close to 1.0. So wow, that's so close to 1.0. Let's just call it 1.0 and call it good.
[09:38.320 --> 09:44.640]  But 98% of the radiation comes from the surface and now let's look at where the
[09:44.640 --> 09:51.960]  rest of the radiation comes from. The other part comes from the sky and this
[09:51.960 --> 10:03.680]  part right here, this tiny arrow, is 0.02 or 2% from the sky. So this sensor is
[10:03.760 --> 10:09.800]  averaging, in some cases, a very cold sky temperature with the temperature of the
[10:09.800 --> 10:17.040]  canopy and it's important to correct for this in the software of the sensor. This
[10:17.040 --> 10:24.360]  is well characterized. We know the typical emissivities of canopies so we
[10:24.360 --> 10:32.000]  can use this to pinpoint measurements. There's the equation. Fraction reflected
[10:32.120 --> 10:41.800]  is 1 minus the emissivity so it's 0.2. This is the correction factor. We need to
[10:41.800 --> 10:47.560]  know, this is the equation but it's more important to know the inputs, measured
[10:47.560 --> 10:54.280]  temperature of the sensor. That's this temperature right here. Background
[10:54.280 --> 10:59.200]  temperature up here is the sky temperature in degrees C and then we
[10:59.200 --> 11:05.840]  need to know this. Now we typically look this number up, we measure this, we
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.240]  measure this, and we can solve for the canopy temperature. I'm not going to go
[11:11.240 --> 11:17.320]  into the details of this equation right here but suffice it to say that this is
[11:17.320 --> 11:22.360]  well described on the Apogee website and we've described it in manuscripts we've
[11:22.360 --> 11:29.960]  written. The take-home message is all objects measure the object plus averaging
[11:29.960 --> 11:35.880]  in some of the background temperature. If you keep that in mind you realize
[11:35.880 --> 11:43.880]  the errors you can get into. Let's take an example. Clear day, 25 degrees
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.440]  measured, the background is minus 40 so that's a typical background of the very
[11:49.560 --> 11:56.680]  clear sky. The infinity of outer space is 0 Kelvin so that tells you why we get
[11:56.680 --> 12:04.520]  such cold sky temperatures. Emissivity 0.98, what we measured was 25 and the
[12:04.520 --> 12:12.720]  actual surface temperature was 25.95, almost a 1 degree C error if we don't
[12:12.720 --> 12:18.400]  account for emissivity even though this is very high. Let's take a cloudy day on
[12:18.400 --> 12:26.480]  here, 25, now the sky is much warmer and this error is much smaller on a cloudy
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.520]  day. So again these are examples of why it's so important to correct for
[12:31.520 --> 12:42.520]  emissivity. Let's look at the field of view. All sensors have a cone-shaped
[12:42.520 --> 12:50.000]  field of view. Here's the target right here and it's critical to understand
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.720]  what you're looking at. So to do the trigonometry of this we called this
[12:56.720 --> 13:03.720]  angle here and this angle here and now we've got a right angle and this is the
[13:03.720 --> 13:11.960]  half angle here. So this describes how big the target is. Apogee describes this
[13:12.120 --> 13:21.320]  in two ways, the ratio of the distance to the target to the target diameter. So
[13:21.320 --> 13:29.000]  this ratio, you don't need to know trigonometry to understand that ratio. We
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.360]  also describe it as the half angle right here, this distance here. Apogee
[13:35.360 --> 13:41.200]  sells a series of sensors at different fields of view but it's imperative to
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.640]  know what you're looking at because you do not want to be averaging the sky, the
[13:46.640 --> 13:52.120]  sidewalks, other things off on the sides. It's important that this be small but
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.160]  it's even more important that we know what we're looking at. So this is
[13:56.160 --> 14:01.800]  described in two ways, distance to target divided by target diameter and then the
[14:02.400 --> 14:12.840]  angle. So let's take a look at the area that is measured with this. It depends on
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.440]  three things, this field of view that we just talked about, obviously mounting
[14:17.440 --> 14:24.360]  height. The higher up, if this sensor is up here, the same field of view, we're
[14:24.360 --> 14:30.160]  going to see a much larger circle. So that's the second parameter and then the
[14:30.320 --> 14:38.160]  angle. We don't always point these down, sometimes and often we point them like
[14:38.160 --> 14:46.840]  this and now it sees an oval shaped out here. So these three parameters determine
[14:46.840 --> 14:53.480]  what we're looking at. The next slide walks you through this on what we see
[14:53.480 --> 14:58.600]  with these. So this is an example, here's one that was 22 degrees field of view.
[14:58.840 --> 15:03.800]  Here, this is one of the Apogee sensors. So let's look at the field of view options.
[15:03.800 --> 15:11.000]  These are one, two, three, four options that Apogee offers for fields of view.
[15:11.000 --> 15:18.840]  This is an example over a target, narrow, medium, wider, and then rectangular.
[15:18.840 --> 15:22.520]  And again the rectangular, we don't want to see any sky, we don't want to see any
[15:22.600 --> 15:31.080]  ground. Because this is important, Apogee has a field of view tool that is on this
[15:31.080 --> 15:37.840]  website right here, you can find this on the Apogee website, that you
[15:37.840 --> 15:43.200]  put in the type of sensor you have, the model number, it'll tell you the angles, and
[15:43.200 --> 15:48.640]  then it tells you the area that's integrated by that, by doing a bunch of
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.360]  trigonometry calculations. It's just a worksheet, you type in the inputs and it
[15:53.360 --> 15:59.160]  tells you the area. All of these are really to help you fully understand what
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.320]  you're looking at, what's in the field of view, what's not. It's important to be
[16:03.320 --> 16:08.720]  sufficiently narrow, but it's important not to see bad things.
[16:08.720 --> 16:16.720]  So these are the four options, pictures of them. Here's that rectangular,
[16:16.880 --> 16:23.520]  narrow, medium, wide. These are on the website, but lots of options to pinpoint
[16:23.520 --> 16:24.920]  what you're looking at.
[16:24.920 --> 16:34.440]  Next critical thing is the infrared spectral response. Sensors can cover a
[16:34.440 --> 16:42.840]  wide range, but it's important not to measure water vapor in the air. We want
[16:42.840 --> 16:49.640]  to see right through the atmosphere, right to the surface. Lower quality
[16:49.640 --> 16:57.280]  sensors have measured much of this radiation, and this slide shows us some
[16:57.280 --> 17:06.080]  of the interferences from these things on here. Water vapor interferes right
[17:06.080 --> 17:11.360]  here. This is water vapor in the air. We do not want to measure the water vapor
[17:11.400 --> 17:16.680]  in the air. We want to see right through it. I think we've got over here carbon
[17:16.680 --> 17:24.080]  dioxide in the air, has bands down here that absorb, but there is this atmospheric
[17:24.080 --> 17:31.800]  window, as it's called, 8 to 14 microns in which neither water vapor nor CO2
[17:31.800 --> 17:38.200]  interfere with the infrared signal. So the Apogee sensors are calibrated just
[17:38.240 --> 17:43.080]  to measure this wavelength, which means they can see through many kilometers of
[17:43.080 --> 17:50.280]  atmosphere because it's very transparent. This is something that defines the
[17:50.280 --> 17:57.560]  sensor, defines how it's calibrated. Once it's done, all you need to know is
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.040]  it's calibrated to utilize the atmospheric window. It's not something
[18:02.040 --> 18:07.440]  you need to know on a day-to-day basis when you're using it, except when
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.960]  you're correct for the emissivity. It's important to know that it does atmospheric
[18:11.960 --> 18:19.800]  window. So what do we do when we're trying to measure a canopy and it
[18:19.800 --> 18:26.960]  doesn't cover all the ground? This is a common problem. You can't just point it
[18:26.960 --> 18:35.320]  at the plant. Now if we put it right here, we could get it so it's
[18:35.320 --> 18:44.080]  only the plant, but plants move around. We want to average bigger areas. It's not
[18:44.080 --> 18:51.720]  possible to always have it right be above a plant. In this scenario, this
[18:51.720 --> 18:59.400]  fraction of the radiation is from the ground and this fraction is from the plant. So we
[18:59.400 --> 19:05.360]  got a case of partial canopy cover. What this is measuring is both of these
[19:05.360 --> 19:13.760]  together. To solve that, we put it on an angle. Now the same field of view, look
[19:13.760 --> 19:20.560]  at this, all plants. It doesn't see the ground. This is only possible with a
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.120]  narrow field of view so you can see out over the top of the field. So this is a
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.880]  common application to mount it at an angle so you only see the plants. Now
[19:30.880 --> 19:35.840]  there are still cases with young plants where you see some of the ground and the
[19:35.840 --> 19:44.400]  next slide shows that. To separate the ground from the plants, we measure
[19:44.400 --> 19:51.920]  the soil temperature. I'll put degrees C right here and this degree C plant and
[19:51.920 --> 19:57.080]  then what we measure up here and we mathematically separate out the plant
[19:57.080 --> 20:03.360]  temperature from the signal here and the measured soil temperature. This is
[20:03.360 --> 20:07.880]  the approach, fraction of canopy, fraction of ground. It's possible to calculate
[20:07.880 --> 20:12.920]  these fractions and we have some manuscripts that explain doing this. It's
[20:12.920 --> 20:19.200]  a common problem. Here's the equation, temperature of the canopy. This is all to
[20:19.200 --> 20:23.520]  the fourth power, all done in software in the data logger. Temperature of the
[20:23.520 --> 20:32.040]  surface, temperature of the soil, calculating the canopy temperature. So now let's
[20:32.040 --> 20:41.000]  start using these to calculate what we call canopy stomatal conductance. If we
[20:41.000 --> 20:50.040]  point these, if we put a sensor right here and we point it at this leaf, seeing
[20:50.040 --> 20:59.760]  the leaf, let's say the leaf is slightly above air temperature, two degrees above
[20:59.760 --> 21:04.640]  air temperature. We write in our notebooks, oh this leaf is water stressed
[21:04.640 --> 21:09.120]  because the leaves are hotter than the air and that would be correct. But now
[21:09.240 --> 21:16.280]  the wind comes up, here's conduction and convection, the wind comes up, the leaf
[21:16.280 --> 21:21.800]  cools off. Well we write in our notebooks, oh the water stress went away. It didn't go
[21:21.800 --> 21:27.280]  away, the wind started blowing. So we have to measure and correct for the effect of
[21:27.280 --> 21:32.920]  wind. The sun goes under a cloud, we have to measure and correct for the effect of
[21:32.920 --> 21:41.160]  wind speed. We also have to measure the relative humidity of the air. That
[21:41.160 --> 21:47.040]  determines the driving gradient. If the air is humid, the plants are going to
[21:47.040 --> 21:51.480]  warm up. They're not out of water, they just can't cool from transpiration as
[21:51.480 --> 21:58.760]  fast. So all of these parameters in here are necessary to pinpoint water stress
[21:58.920 --> 22:07.920]  for plants over a wide range of environments. This is an example slide that we use to show this.
[22:07.920 --> 22:17.600]  The overriding equation for this is Rn, which is net radiation. That's the sum of
[22:17.600 --> 22:24.840]  this outgoing shortwave, incoming shortwave, incoming longwave, and over
[22:24.840 --> 22:32.720]  here leaf radiation. These four all go into net radiation. That equals
[22:32.720 --> 22:42.880]  transpiration, and I'll put a TR for transpiration, plus conduction and
[22:42.880 --> 22:51.360]  convection. Usually that's called H for conduction and convection. This is a
[22:51.360 --> 22:57.520]  simple equation, and by measuring all these we pinpoint the water status of
[22:57.520 --> 23:04.880]  the plant. So let's take another look at this in another diagram. This is a lot of
[23:04.880 --> 23:11.400]  equations, a lot of math, but this is where this comes from. This is from this
[23:11.400 --> 23:17.720]  manuscript by Mark Bonquist, our colleague John Norman at the University
[23:17.720 --> 23:24.280]  of Wisconsin, and myself from 2009. It's a paper that works through all of this,
[23:24.280 --> 23:29.680]  and I refer you to the paper for details. But here's that equation I just drew
[23:29.680 --> 23:36.800]  right here. Net radiation, H is for conduction and convection, delta E is for
[23:36.800 --> 23:41.280]  transpiration, and this is photosynthesis. Some of the energy goes into
[23:41.280 --> 23:50.200]  photosynthesis in this equation. We account for that. This H here is further
[23:50.200 --> 23:56.840]  broken down into the canopy to air temperatures times conductance. That
[23:56.840 --> 24:04.360]  gives us H. It's further broken down into transpiration. This difference here is
[24:04.360 --> 24:10.520]  saturation vapor pressure. So we measure these parameters, calculate
[24:10.520 --> 24:17.960]  transpiration, and this is canopy and stomatal conductance to get GT canopy
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.520]  stomatal conductance. These are all the parameters necessary to measure that.
[24:22.520 --> 24:28.800]  It's a lot of parameters, but the information is extremely valuable. So we
[24:28.800 --> 24:36.000]  take these equations and substitute them all in this, and this is part of Mark's
[24:36.000 --> 24:44.880]  excellence in advanced algebra, and we get an equation that integrates all of
[24:44.880 --> 24:50.680]  them here. This is canopy stomatal conductance mathematically into all of
[24:50.680 --> 24:58.960]  these. I don't know if I can erase my line there. So this equation is all done in
[24:58.960 --> 25:03.400]  dataloggers with these inputs, and we've done this now over many fields to
[25:03.400 --> 25:08.320]  pinpoint water status, and I'd like to show you some of that data. The next
[25:08.320 --> 25:14.600]  slide shows that. The advantage of this is it's a physiological variable related to
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.640]  stomatal conductance, and everything's in here. It can work anywhere in the world
[25:20.640 --> 25:26.760]  as long as you have these inputs to it. So let's take a look at some of these
[25:26.760 --> 25:35.520]  examples. This was at Nebraska a couple summers ago. We measured, we have a model
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.920]  that gives us the potential stomatal conductance. If the plant is well watered,
[25:40.920 --> 25:48.440]  it should transpire at the potential rate. You can see here's day and night,
[25:48.440 --> 25:54.760]  and day and the night the stomates are closed. Some of these aren't smooth
[25:54.760 --> 26:00.920]  because there was clouds and other parameters. This is our measured
[26:00.920 --> 26:11.040]  parameters. What we calculate is the ratio of these two. How open were the
[26:11.040 --> 26:16.880]  stomates? This is canopy stomatal conductance in moles per meter squared
[26:16.880 --> 26:23.880]  per second, a fundamental measurement. The ratio of actual to potential, and that's
[26:23.920 --> 26:31.680]  what this is. The potential should always be one. Now here's some cases where it got
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.520]  above one, and we think this was wet leaves that made this go above one,
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.920]  because obviously you should never get above the potential. But look what happens after a
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.960]  rainfall here. It gets less, and now look at what happens in the day. It also went
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.720]  down during the course of the day. They were more open in the morning than the
[26:53.720 --> 27:01.840]  evening. Further down, further down as they dried out. Then, let's look at, this is the
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.520]  slope of this. Now let's look at what happens right here. Another rainfall, 20
[27:07.520 --> 27:13.560]  millimeters of rainfall happened right here. The stomates jump back up to their
[27:13.560 --> 27:20.480]  potential, and even slightly above. Then they started that downward march again.
[27:20.480 --> 27:30.640]  This is the power of using infrared thermometry to sort out the water
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.920]  potential and the stomatal conductance of the plants. This is the average
[27:35.920 --> 27:42.120]  conductance of all of the leaves in the field of view of the plant, and it's an
[27:42.160 --> 27:49.200]  automated measurement. It can be made day after day. Let's look at our next
[27:49.200 --> 27:56.440]  parameter. This is a graph now of potential canopies to model
[27:56.440 --> 28:03.240]  conductance, and actual. Here's our one-to-one line. If they're always near
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.760]  the potential to fall on that line, they're close to this. The other
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.480]  environmental parameters affect this. Humidity, wind, solar radiation, but each
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.840]  case they're close to their potential. What happened up here? This is, we think,
[28:20.840 --> 28:27.480]  wet leaves. When the leaves are wet, we get numbers that are above one.
[28:27.480 --> 28:33.440]  Just a few values, but this shows the power of this technique for
[28:33.520 --> 28:40.880]  pinpointing water stress in plants. We have just a few more slides. A conclusion.
[28:40.880 --> 28:47.360]  Canopy temperatures can be used to determine plant canopy water stress, and
[28:47.360 --> 28:52.960]  in this example, canopy stomatal conductance. There are simple methods to do
[28:52.960 --> 28:58.840]  this, and complex methods are the ones I've described here, where we measure all
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.840]  the parameters and account for all of them. The complex measurements work over
[29:03.840 --> 29:10.440]  a wider range of conditions than the simple measurements. Emissivity, that
[29:10.440 --> 29:16.080]  correction for that can be significant. So we measure sky temperature and
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.560]  mathematically correct that, and then field of view. We talked about that.
[29:20.560 --> 29:26.560]  Partial canopy cover, we need to sort that out. This is the reference to the
[29:26.680 --> 29:33.040]  paper we're talking about. Apogee can give you copies of this. It's on the
[29:33.040 --> 29:38.840]  website. So this shows the details of making this measurement. Now one more
[29:38.840 --> 29:45.520]  slide. I want to talk about maintenance of these sensors. It's one thing to get a
[29:45.520 --> 29:50.680]  new sensor and get accurate data, but how about week after week, month after month
[29:50.680 --> 29:57.720]  get an accurate data. Three things cause problems. One, optical path interferences.
[29:57.720 --> 30:03.600]  This is true of all radiation measurement instruments. Spiders right
[30:03.600 --> 30:09.520]  here can make a nest inside this window. Some places never see this. Other
[30:09.520 --> 30:15.720]  places have a lot of spiders. So there's a spider nest inside that window. When
[30:15.720 --> 30:20.000]  that happens, the sensor suddenly flatlines. It just starts reading its own
[30:20.040 --> 30:24.560]  temperature so you can tell when it happens. You get in there with a Q-tip,
[30:24.560 --> 30:30.480]  and this is so important that Apogee sells these scientific Q-tips. Put it
[30:30.480 --> 30:35.240]  right in that sensor and clean that right out. You can also use some
[30:35.240 --> 30:40.800]  methanol to further clean this. Sometimes it can be helpful or just water, but you
[30:40.800 --> 30:48.120]  got to keep that sensor clean. Second thing is calcium deposits. When sprinkler
[30:48.240 --> 30:56.520]  irrigation blasts this thing day after day, if it's being hit by moisture, it doesn't
[30:56.520 --> 31:01.520]  hurt the sensor. This is very waterproof, but it evaporates and it leaves a little
[31:01.520 --> 31:07.120]  film, a hard water film, on the inside window of the sensor. It only happens when you
[31:07.120 --> 31:11.800]  have water shooting up on it. That evaporates, you get this film. People
[31:11.800 --> 31:16.520]  sometimes use things like Windex to get that off. That doesn't help, not at all.
[31:17.040 --> 31:23.680]  You have to clean calcium with a dilute acid. In fact, it doesn't even have to be that
[31:23.680 --> 31:30.320]  dilute because the sensor is very rugged. Again, take the Q-tips, dip them
[31:30.320 --> 31:36.040]  in vinegar, or a dilute acid. You can clean it with acid and it comes right off.
[31:36.040 --> 31:41.680]  Don't try things like acetone to clean it because that doesn't clean off salt
[31:41.680 --> 31:47.880]  deposits. The third biggie is dust and dirt. This happens in all windows, happens in the
[31:47.880 --> 31:55.080]  windows of your house. This you can clean with window cleaning products like
[31:55.080 --> 32:01.560]  ammonium cleans this. You can use methanol, even acetone in here. The key,
[32:01.560 --> 32:06.160]  don't push too hard because you scratch the window. Let the chemistry clean the
[32:06.160 --> 32:11.760]  window, not mechanically screen it. Here's the Apogee website that talks about
[32:11.760 --> 32:23.000]  caring for this Apogee radiometer. That's the summary of the principles of
[32:23.000 --> 32:27.760]  making this measurement, the things you need to watch out for. You can spend your
[32:27.760 --> 32:31.600]  life getting better and better at this, but you can see, I think, that this is a
[32:31.600 --> 32:37.480]  very powerful measurement. We're excited to work with you to help collect better
[32:37.480 --> 32:39.480]  data. Thanks for listening.
