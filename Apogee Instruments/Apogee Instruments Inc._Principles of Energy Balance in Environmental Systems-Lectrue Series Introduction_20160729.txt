[00:01.080 --> 00:08.720]  I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is an introduction to a seven lecture series
[00:08.720 --> 00:16.320]  on the principles of energy balance in environmental systems. So in this
[00:16.320 --> 00:22.200]  overview I'm going to go through what each of the lectures discusses to give
[00:22.200 --> 00:26.920]  you the opportunity to skip to certain lectures and go back and review
[00:26.920 --> 00:35.400]  specific things so you know exactly what's in each of the seven lectures. So
[00:35.400 --> 00:43.680]  here's the first lecture. It's got a detailed outline. In that lecture I give
[00:43.680 --> 00:49.280]  an introduction to water use in agriculture. Water in agriculture uses at
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.280]  least 70% of the water in the nation and where does all that water go? That's the
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.640]  huge criteria here. And then secondly, how do we exactly measure how much of that
[01:01.640 --> 01:06.840]  water is used by agriculture? The answer is we use principles of energy balance.
[01:06.840 --> 01:12.240]  So this tells us the challenge of this whole thing and the importance of it. I
[01:12.240 --> 01:17.880]  review several reference books on this. One of them we use as a textbook for
[01:17.880 --> 01:23.800]  this class. Then we get into this first law of thermodynamics and the seven
[01:23.840 --> 01:30.400]  components. Latent heat of evaporation, understanding energy and power. This is
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.680]  joules and watts, and finally short and long wave radiation. And then we give you
[01:35.680 --> 01:42.240]  homework. The first homework is E equals mc squared homework. That's lecture
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.520]  one to let you go quickly to that and see what's in there. Now let's take a
[01:47.520 --> 01:54.480]  look at lecture two. Talked about the key for the homework, how to calculate
[01:54.480 --> 02:00.800]  the energy in a pea seed. Units of conversions, capital C for calories,
[02:00.800 --> 02:06.200]  lowercase. Then we calculate the efficiency of photosynthesis and show
[02:06.200 --> 02:12.120]  that this is really so small we can ignore it in these principles. Finally,
[02:12.280 --> 02:20.040]  absorbed shortwave radiation and the importance of albedo. The three component
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.160]  parts of shortwave radiation, UV, photosynthetic, and near-infrared.
[02:25.160 --> 02:32.200]  Definitions. What is shortwave? What's long wave? And then we introduce the
[02:32.200 --> 02:38.720]  Stefan-Boltzmann law for shortwave radiation. That's the end of lecture two.
[02:38.720 --> 02:50.720]  Lecture three gets us into the concept of emissivity. Let's see if I can center
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.240]  these right there. Concept of emissivity. This is about long wave radiation.
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.720]  Calculating long wave emitted, net long wave, and then finally bringing all the
[03:01.720 --> 03:07.680]  radiation together in lecture three. Net absorbed shortwave and net absorbed long
[03:07.680 --> 03:14.200]  wave. So this is the end of the principles in the three lectures. Then we
[03:14.200 --> 03:20.440]  open lecture four. Applying energy balance principles to the planet Earth.
[03:20.440 --> 03:27.080]  And this also gets into what's the, is the energy balance perfectly on the
[03:27.080 --> 03:33.320]  earth or is the earth slightly warming? And this really helps you understand the
[03:33.320 --> 03:38.360]  challenge of accurately measuring small amounts of global warming. The best minds
[03:38.360 --> 03:44.000]  in the planet are working on this now. Then we get into differential absorption
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.560]  of short and long wave radiation. Not all the wavelengths are the same. Reflectance
[03:49.560 --> 03:55.120]  of long wave radiation, a tiny bit is reflected. And then two critical
[03:55.120 --> 04:02.040]  equations that apply to these types of radiation. One is Wien's law and the
[04:02.040 --> 04:16.660]  second one is Planck's law. That's the end of the fourth lecture. Lecture five, we
[04:16.660 --> 04:23.260]  focus on transpiration. Now we have net radiation in here. The whole lecture is
[04:23.260 --> 04:30.420]  all on how we calculate transpiration, which is the flux of water.
[04:30.420 --> 04:35.700]  Transpiration is determined by the driving gradient for transpiration for a
[04:35.780 --> 04:42.700]  evaporation divided by the resistance to flow of these water molecules out into
[04:42.700 --> 04:48.620]  the atmosphere. We discuss absolute and relative humidity. That's critical to
[04:48.620 --> 04:53.820]  understanding those two. The flux, calculating the driving gradient,
[04:53.820 --> 04:58.300]  determining stomatal conductance, and finally modeling it. That's all in
[04:58.300 --> 05:06.420]  lecture five. Lecture six, I'll move it up just a bit. Conduction and convection.
[05:06.420 --> 05:12.860]  The next big component part of this. Hot air blowing away, hot surfaces blowing
[05:12.860 --> 05:18.900]  away to cold surfaces. That's driven by boundary layer resistance or boundary
[05:18.900 --> 05:23.460]  layer conductance. How do we measure that and how do we model the
[05:23.540 --> 05:29.780]  movement heat by conduction and convection? These components then
[05:29.780 --> 05:36.060]  compromise the whole energy balance equation and the component parts. In
[05:36.060 --> 05:40.700]  the end the goal is to calculate the movement of water through the system.
[05:40.700 --> 05:48.500]  Lecture seven, the last and final lecture, is a summary and application of the
[05:48.500 --> 05:57.460]  principles. We look at water movement in the day, but what happens at night? Now
[05:57.460 --> 06:05.460]  the Sun sets and all of the surfaces get colder than the air temperature. On a
[06:05.460 --> 06:11.660]  clear night they radiate to the sky and we get radiation frost. Things freeze
[06:11.660 --> 06:15.980]  even when the air temperature is not freezing. We go through those and then
[06:15.980 --> 06:21.660]  finally a summary of how do these principles apply to the very famous
[06:21.660 --> 06:28.820]  Penman-Monteith equation. How do we use that to model transpiration rates?
[06:28.820 --> 06:34.980]  Then finally the much simpler Hargrave's equation, which is elegant in its
[06:34.980 --> 06:41.820]  simplicity and almost as accurate as the Penman-Monteith. This is a summary
[06:41.820 --> 06:48.380]  lecture of all the principles of energy balance. With this
[06:48.380 --> 06:54.660]  introduction you can skip around to the lectures and look at the ones that you
[06:54.660 --> 07:01.580]  are most interested in. They generally build on each other, but it's not
[07:01.580 --> 07:07.540]  required that you go through an order because we expect all the viewers are
[07:07.540 --> 07:10.980]  going to have different backgrounds and certain component parts are going to be
[07:10.980 --> 07:18.020]  more important than others. Thanks for listening and let the lectures begin.
