[00:01.920 --> 00:06.280]  We teach all our students hybrid vigor.
[00:06.280 --> 00:12.040]  And if this was some kind of comprehensive exam, we would ask you to define exactly what
[00:12.040 --> 00:13.960]  it is that's hybrid vigor.
[00:13.960 --> 00:20.760]  And we like to think that by merging plants and soils and climate, we get hybrid vigor
[00:20.760 --> 00:23.000]  in our department.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.280]  And as you learn in Plant Science 101, that is hybrid vigor is just diversity of genes
[00:28.280 --> 00:35.000]  mixed all together, where the outcome is better than you would ever expect from the sum of
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.520]  the component parts.
[00:37.520 --> 00:45.280]  And with that idea, we are fortunate to have funds for invited speakers in our department.
[00:45.280 --> 00:51.800]  And when they come from another place, they bring us hybrid vigor and insights to things
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.840]  that we might not have come up with by ourselves.
[00:56.840 --> 01:04.480]  So today we are honored to have Mark Van Iersel talk about his work.
[01:04.480 --> 01:10.000]  He was at that university in the Netherlands that people spend their whole careers trying
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.280]  to pronounce the university.
[01:14.280 --> 01:16.280]  And I...
[01:16.280 --> 01:18.400]  Wageningen.
[01:18.400 --> 01:25.840]  And that was the subject of a National Geographic cover story, I think, not long ago.
[01:25.840 --> 01:28.320]  The Netherlands feed the world.
[01:28.320 --> 01:32.680]  And Mark is a product of that university.
[01:32.680 --> 01:41.640]  He came here for PhD with a guy named Eric Oosterhuis, who was a personal friend of mine.
[01:41.640 --> 01:48.080]  And he did such an outstanding job that we were able to get him here as a postdoc.
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.080]  And that's about 18 years ago or something, long time ago.
[01:53.080 --> 01:59.800]  And he then went to the University of Georgia and he recently got an endowed chair at Georgia,
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.920]  which gives him more money to work with.
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.960]  He's brought a lot of diverse expertise to the study of plant physiology and particularly
[02:09.960 --> 02:17.860]  plant physiology in controlled environments, using them to study things that are much broader
[02:17.860 --> 02:20.600]  than the controlled environment themselves.
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.960]  So you can see what he's going to talk to us about today.
[02:25.960 --> 02:32.880]  Professor Hipps is pretty excited to hear about cannabis research with this.
[02:32.880 --> 02:43.300]  So please welcome Mark van Ersel.
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.300]  Thank you, Bruce.
[02:44.300 --> 02:47.140]  And I'll clap on this mic.
[02:47.140 --> 02:49.980]  And so Bruce talks about hybrid vega.
[02:49.980 --> 02:54.780]  I might refer to it slightly as inbreeding, given that I'm coming back to the university
[02:55.300 --> 02:57.300]  where I did my postdoc.
[02:57.300 --> 03:00.300]  I had a great time here, slightly longer than 18 years ago.
[03:00.300 --> 03:05.420]  And my former PhD student, Shu Yang, in the back is the new postdoc in Bruce's lab.
[03:05.420 --> 03:14.860]  So not so much hybrid vega as much as selecting elite lines at this point.
[03:14.860 --> 03:18.180]  So I've worked in controlled environment agriculture for a long time.
[03:18.180 --> 03:21.740]  I'm really focused now on specifically lighting.
[03:21.740 --> 03:24.460]  And controlled environment agriculture is a vague term.
[03:25.140 --> 03:31.180]  So when I talk about that, I'm basically talking about greenhouses and vertical farms.
[03:31.180 --> 03:38.220]  And when I started on this project about five years ago, I was initially really focused
[03:38.220 --> 03:44.740]  more on vertical farms than on greenhouses, because in vertical farms, all of the light
[03:44.740 --> 03:50.940]  that you need to grow your crop has to be provided from some kind of an electrical light.
[03:50.940 --> 03:51.940]  And why does that matter?
[03:51.940 --> 03:53.940]  Why is that such a big deal?
[03:53.940 --> 04:01.500]  Well, this is a really dense engineering report developed by the German Aerospace Center.
[04:01.500 --> 04:07.380]  And so they did a hypothetical design of what it would take to build a massive vertical
[04:07.380 --> 04:15.460]  farm, 37 floors high, and probably, given that it is German engineered, way over engineered
[04:15.460 --> 04:17.780]  in many aspects.
[04:17.780 --> 04:19.740]  But it would probably run flawlessly.
[04:19.740 --> 04:24.300]  They didn't get the money to actually build this, but they looked at what it would take
[04:24.300 --> 04:25.300]  to build this.
[04:25.300 --> 04:28.180]  And they looked at construction costs as well as operating costs.
[04:28.180 --> 04:33.580]  And when they did the analysis of what it would take to operate this, it turned out
[04:33.580 --> 04:39.580]  that power to run this building was 60% of annual cost.
[04:39.580 --> 04:46.620]  And of that power, about half of that, so 30% of the overall operating cost, is needed
[04:46.620 --> 04:49.540]  to just run the lights.
[04:49.540 --> 04:51.580]  Those lights are going to produce heat.
[04:51.580 --> 04:55.180]  And so the other 30% is pretty much all air conditioning.
[04:55.180 --> 05:00.420]  And that air conditioning is needed to remove the heat that you get from the lights.
[05:00.420 --> 05:05.940]  And it is needed to remove water vapour from the air because all of these plants are producing
[05:05.940 --> 05:06.940]  water.
[05:06.940 --> 05:09.500]  So it's a massive amount of money.
[05:09.500 --> 05:16.060]  So can we reduce how much energy it actually takes to grow these plants?
[05:16.060 --> 05:21.860]  But as I was thinking about this more and more, I came to realise greenhouses are actually
[05:21.860 --> 05:26.220]  a much more interesting or challenging system to work in.
[05:26.220 --> 05:31.060]  So this is a greenhouse just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina.
[05:31.060 --> 05:34.940]  And look at the light environment that these plants are growing under.
[05:34.940 --> 05:37.060]  It's a mess.
[05:37.060 --> 05:41.980]  So how do you manage light in a greenhouse where things are constantly changing?
[05:41.980 --> 05:48.060]  They are spatially clearly highly variable, in this case largely because of the very large
[05:48.060 --> 05:50.900]  amount of hanging baskets that are growing.
[05:50.900 --> 05:55.140]  But so it's actually much more complicated to manage lighting in a greenhouse compared
[05:55.140 --> 05:57.660]  to a vertical farm.
[05:57.660 --> 06:01.180]  And in greenhouse you obviously have temporal variability too.
[06:01.180 --> 06:07.300]  So this is just light data from one day in the winter in our greenhouse.
[06:07.340 --> 06:12.460]  And even on a sunny day like we have here, at some point during the day like here and
[06:12.460 --> 06:16.980]  here, you get shading just from the overhead structure of your greenhouse.
[06:16.980 --> 06:23.780]  So things are highly dynamic in a greenhouse which makes it really different from vertical farms.
[06:23.780 --> 06:29.940]  And so in the greenhouse industry we typically just integrate the total amount of light that
[06:29.940 --> 06:31.660]  you get over the course of a day.
[06:31.660 --> 06:34.420]  We call that the daily light integral.
[06:34.460 --> 06:39.860]  And so for growing different crops we typically make recommendations that are based on the
[06:39.860 --> 06:41.620]  daily light integral.
[06:41.620 --> 06:47.420]  This crop needs a daily light integral of y.
[06:47.420 --> 06:54.260]  And so this is 14 years worth of data from Cornell University where they monitor daily
[06:54.260 --> 06:58.220]  light integral every single day.
[06:58.220 --> 07:02.660]  And you can see that there are seasonal differences in daily light integral.
[07:02.660 --> 07:09.260]  But even in the middle of summer in Cornell you can have a daily light integral as low
[07:09.260 --> 07:16.140]  as maybe 6 moles per square metre per day and as high as 70 moles per square metre per day.
[07:16.140 --> 07:18.540]  So again, lots of variability.
[07:18.540 --> 07:19.820]  So how do you manage that?
[07:19.820 --> 07:24.100]  How do you grow a crop when you don't know what the light is going to be?
[07:24.100 --> 07:27.980]  And so Cornell focused a lot on lattice research.
[07:27.980 --> 07:29.740]  For many years they worked on that.
[07:30.140 --> 07:35.020]  And after years of studies what they found out is that the one cultivar of lattice that
[07:35.020 --> 07:43.060]  they actually studied, it does best if you give it a daily light integral of 17 moles
[07:43.060 --> 07:44.620]  per square metre per day.
[07:44.620 --> 07:51.260]  And what that means is that for every dot that you see below this red line, you need
[07:51.260 --> 07:53.500]  to provide supplemental lighting.
[07:53.500 --> 07:57.860]  Anytime you get above that red line, you need to provide shading.
[07:57.860 --> 07:59.420]  And I'm not that interested in shading.
[07:59.420 --> 08:03.940]  I'm more interested in the lighting part, which you can see on how many days you actually
[08:03.940 --> 08:10.020]  would need to provide supplemental light to reach that target of 17 moles.
[08:10.020 --> 08:12.900]  So why does this matter in the greenhouse industry?
[08:12.900 --> 08:17.980]  So if you look at a typical greenhouse that is using supplemental lighting, they might
[08:17.980 --> 08:24.220]  have 500, 400 watt high pressure sodium lights per hectare of greenhouse.
[08:24.220 --> 08:26.980]  And they may run them for 14 hours a day.
[08:26.980 --> 08:30.260]  Let's just assume that they pay 10 cents a kilowatt hour.
[08:30.260 --> 08:38.740]  It turns out that they pay $280 per hectare per day just in electricity to run their lights.
[08:38.740 --> 08:47.500]  Now if they run the lights for half the year, they spend $50,000 per hectare just on electricity.
[08:47.500 --> 08:50.620]  So that's a good amount of money.
[08:50.620 --> 08:55.780]  In a recent Department of Energy report, they estimated the total cost of providing lighting
[08:55.820 --> 08:57.940]  in controlled environment agriculture.
[08:57.940 --> 09:02.340]  And that's $600 million a year in the United States.
[09:02.340 --> 09:03.380]  So that's a lot of money.
[09:03.380 --> 09:07.460]  If we can reduce that by 10%, that's $60 million.
[09:07.460 --> 09:11.620]  That's almost real money.
[09:11.620 --> 09:17.180]  So this is a map that shows the daily light integral in different parts of the United
[09:17.180 --> 09:24.140]  States and different times of the year, developed by Jim Faust, who is now at Clemson University.
[09:24.140 --> 09:29.700]  And surprisingly, you have big changes over the course of the year in how much light you
[09:29.700 --> 09:32.060]  can expect to get.
[09:32.060 --> 09:37.300]  And this map was initially developed to try to get some idea of how much or what crops
[09:37.300 --> 09:42.020]  can you grow where, what time of the year, how much supplemental light might you need
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.580]  to provide.
[09:43.580 --> 09:48.700]  But this makes it still pretty difficult to actually figure out for a particular crop,
[09:48.700 --> 09:52.700]  how much light do I need to give in addition to sunlight?
[09:53.380 --> 09:58.540]  In the last two months, I worked with two colleagues at Cornell to develop a different
[09:58.540 --> 10:00.420]  kind of a map.
[10:00.420 --> 10:06.020]  And so what we did is let's assume that we are going to grow lettuce.
[10:06.020 --> 10:12.020]  And we want to make sure that every single day of the year, we have a daily light integral
[10:12.020 --> 10:16.460]  of 17 moles of photons per square meter per day.
[10:16.460 --> 10:21.700]  We have a supplemental lighting system that can provide an instantaneous photosynthetic
[10:21.700 --> 10:25.580]  photon flux of 200 micromoles per square meter per second.
[10:25.580 --> 10:35.020]  And so using typical weather data from around the US, we calculated the number of hours
[10:35.020 --> 10:41.020]  on the y-axis here of supplemental light that you need to provide to grow in this example
[10:41.020 --> 10:42.020]  lettuce.
[10:42.020 --> 10:47.340]  And we can easily run this for whatever crop you're interested in.
[10:47.380 --> 10:52.260]  And not surprisingly, in the southwest, you don't need a lot of supplemental light.
[10:52.260 --> 10:55.620]  Likewise, in Florida, not much.
[10:55.620 --> 10:59.740]  But there are big differences in how much light you need in different parts of the country.
[10:59.740 --> 11:05.740]  And it makes it difficult to come up with general guidelines for, is it actually cost
[11:05.740 --> 11:09.300]  effective to install a supplemental lighting system?
[11:09.300 --> 11:15.740]  So along with an agricultural economist at the University of Georgia, we tried to estimate
[11:15.820 --> 11:19.500]  the return on investment of installing a lighting system.
[11:19.500 --> 11:21.780]  And we did that for two locations.
[11:21.780 --> 11:26.380]  So we used Athens, Georgia, because that's where we live.
[11:26.380 --> 11:28.540]  And then we used Seattle, Washington.
[11:28.540 --> 11:32.940]  And you can probably guess why we picked Seattle as the other place.
[11:32.940 --> 11:38.540]  It is, well, if supplemental lighting is going to pay anywhere, it is probably going to be
[11:38.540 --> 11:39.540]  in Seattle.
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.660]  And they don't get much light.
[11:42.660 --> 11:47.020]  So in Seattle, if you provide supplemental lighting to lettuce, you can expect to get
[11:47.020 --> 11:53.300]  an additional 5.3 crops a year by providing that light.
[11:53.300 --> 12:02.420]  And on a per hectare basis, that means that you are going to gross $283,000 per year extra.
[12:02.420 --> 12:05.580]  Now, of course, the lighting isn't free.
[12:05.580 --> 12:11.340]  So it will take you about $220,000 per hectare per year to actually pay for the lighting.
[12:11.420 --> 12:16.300]  And that includes both installation and operating cost of the lighting system.
[12:16.300 --> 12:22.700]  But so net, you have an additional $63,000 per hectare per year in profits.
[12:22.700 --> 12:24.400]  So that's a pretty nice amount.
[12:24.400 --> 12:30.060]  So in a place like Seattle, yes, this is probably going to be a really good investment.
[12:30.060 --> 12:33.900]  When you look at Georgia, Athens, Georgia, the situation is different.
[12:33.940 --> 12:41.620]  So you may get 2.3 extra crops a year, which grosses you another $123,000.
[12:41.620 --> 12:45.220]  But it's going to cost you $120,000.
[12:45.220 --> 12:50.460]  So you might expect $3,000 in extra profit from installing a lighting system.
[12:50.460 --> 12:53.420]  And that is probably not going to be worth the investment.
[12:53.420 --> 12:57.060]  And so what we are really interested in is trying to help growers make these decisions
[12:57.060 --> 13:03.020]  based on the local climatic conditions of whether or not it is cost effective for them
[13:03.020 --> 13:07.300]  to actually install that lighting.
[13:07.300 --> 13:10.020]  But so I'm a physiologist, not an economist.
[13:10.020 --> 13:12.780]  I know nothing about economics.
[13:12.780 --> 13:18.940]  Other than that, I know that growers make decisions based on expected return on investment.
[13:18.940 --> 13:23.700]  But so my part of this is to try to make sure that we provide supplemental lighting
[13:23.700 --> 13:27.300]  in the most efficient way that we can.
[13:27.300 --> 13:30.540]  And so then we start out with a simple question.
[13:30.580 --> 13:34.660]  How do we actually quantify how efficiently light is being used?
[13:34.660 --> 13:41.020]  And so for that, well, hopefully we all know that plants need light for photosynthesis.
[13:41.020 --> 13:42.500]  That's not exactly new.
[13:42.500 --> 13:48.380]  So we have just a very simplistic diagram where we have sunlight providing light
[13:48.380 --> 13:52.340]  for the light reactions, creating ATP and NADPH.
[13:52.340 --> 13:58.260]  The Kelvin cycle then uses that ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 to make carbohydrates,
[13:58.260 --> 14:03.820]  which the plant can then use for growth and maintenance processes.
[14:03.820 --> 14:10.900]  So initially, the light is used right here in the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[14:10.900 --> 14:17.420]  So if we really want to study at a physiological level how efficiently plants use light,
[14:17.420 --> 14:20.740]  then this may be a good starting point.
[14:20.740 --> 14:26.900]  And so when light reaches a chloroplast, it is absorbed by pigment molecules.
[14:26.900 --> 14:29.020]  It bounces from one pigment molecule.
[14:29.020 --> 14:32.900]  The energy ultimately is funneled towards a reaction center
[14:32.900 --> 14:37.180]  where that light energy is used to transfer an electron.
[14:37.180 --> 14:41.500]  You're essentially creating a current from light energy.
[14:41.500 --> 14:46.420]  And so this diagram shows the entire light reactions of photosynthesis
[14:46.420 --> 14:56.180]  where we have a pretty happy sun in the top left, and it's going to provide us with a photon.
[14:56.220 --> 14:57.420]  There it goes.
[14:57.420 --> 15:01.980]  And with the energy from that photon, an electron from water starts moving
[15:01.980 --> 15:04.500]  through the electron transport chain.
[15:04.500 --> 15:08.180]  It stops right here because that's the rate limiting step in the whole process
[15:08.180 --> 15:10.860]  of the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[15:10.860 --> 15:16.660]  And so as long as this electron is right here inside of photosystem II,
[15:16.660 --> 15:19.980]  photosystem II cannot accept additional light energy.
[15:19.980 --> 15:24.220]  So if there is an auto photon that now gets towards photosystem II,
[15:24.220 --> 15:27.060]  photosystem II cannot use it.
[15:27.060 --> 15:31.220]  From there, the electron moves on, and with the help of a second photon,
[15:31.220 --> 15:34.780]  ultimately the electron goes to NADPH.
[15:34.780 --> 15:39.380]  So we are really interested in this process right here in photosystem II
[15:39.380 --> 15:45.860]  and how efficiently photosystem II is using light energy to move electrons.
[15:45.860 --> 15:53.180]  So not all of the light that reaches leaves is actually used for the chemistry
[15:53.180 --> 15:55.220]  or electron transport.
[15:55.220 --> 16:00.940]  A lot of the light energy is actually just converted into heat and essentially lost.
[16:00.940 --> 16:05.580]  That actually is something that is actively controlled by plants and a pretty crucial way
[16:05.580 --> 16:08.460]  for plants to dissipate excess light energy.
[16:08.460 --> 16:14.620]  And then a very small, 1 to 2 percent of the absorbed photons are actually re-emitted
[16:14.620 --> 16:16.860]  in the form of chlorophyll fluorescence.
[16:16.860 --> 16:22.900]  So a plant that you see anywhere, if it is getting light, it is actually giving off light as well.
[16:22.900 --> 16:26.260]  You can't see it because it is so little light.
[16:26.260 --> 16:30.740]  So if you have a green laser pointer and you shine it on a leaf,
[16:30.740 --> 16:34.140]  you can actually see a red glow coming from the leaf.
[16:34.140 --> 16:38.140]  It's pretty neat when you see that.
[16:38.140 --> 16:43.580]  So it turns out that chlorophyll fluorescence is something that is really easy to measure.
[16:43.580 --> 16:50.180]  You just clamp the sensor here on a leaf of sweet potato right here,
[16:50.180 --> 16:53.500]  and you can measure how much fluorescence is coming from that leaf.
[16:53.500 --> 16:57.060]  And I'm not going to go through the theory behind fluorescence,
[16:57.060 --> 17:01.380]  but you can calculate lots of things from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements.
[17:01.380 --> 17:08.460]  And one thing that you can calculate is the dark adapted or maximum quantum efficiency
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.940]  of photosystem II.
[17:09.940 --> 17:15.940]  So you do that in plants that have been in the dark for 15 to 30 minutes.
[17:15.940 --> 17:19.700]  You can take a measurement and it gives you an indication whether or not photosystem II
[17:19.700 --> 17:20.700]  is healthy.
[17:20.700 --> 17:26.460]  If photosystem II is damaged, that maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II decreases
[17:26.460 --> 17:30.900]  and it indicates that the plant is under some kind of stress.
[17:30.900 --> 17:36.780]  What is more interesting is that you can also measure the intrinsic quantum efficiency in
[17:36.780 --> 17:37.780]  the light.
[17:37.780 --> 17:42.100]  How efficiently is that leaf using the light that it is absorbing?
[17:42.100 --> 17:47.780]  And so from that, we calculate something that we call phi PSII or the quantum yield of photosystem
[17:47.860 --> 17:53.620]  II, and it is the fraction of absorbed light that is used for photochemistry.
[17:53.620 --> 17:57.980]  And so when you think about supplemental lighting, we would, of course, like that to be high.
[17:57.980 --> 18:04.660]  We want plants to use the light that we give them to use that light for photochemistry.
[18:04.660 --> 18:09.740]  If we measure the quantum yield of photosystem II, we can actually calculate the rate of
[18:09.740 --> 18:14.220]  electron transport through photosystem II using a pretty simple equation.
[18:14.220 --> 18:17.420]  We look at the efficiency of photosystem II.
[18:17.420 --> 18:23.900]  We multiply that by the amount of light that is absorbed by the leaf, and we assume typically
[18:23.900 --> 18:28.100]  that leaves absorb about 84% of the light that hits them.
[18:28.100 --> 18:32.580]  And then we divide that by two because we need two photons to move one electron all
[18:32.580 --> 18:35.660]  the way from water ultimately to NADPH.
[18:35.660 --> 18:39.940]  So we can calculate electron transport rate pretty easily.
[18:39.940 --> 18:46.220]  And so my graduate student, Jeff Weaver, did a relatively simple but pretty interesting
[18:46.220 --> 18:52.100]  study, oh, about two years ago now, where he just monitored the photochemical efficiency
[18:52.100 --> 18:53.860]  of lettuce grown in the greenhouse.
[18:53.860 --> 19:01.740]  So for 30 days, he was growing lettuce from seedlings to full-size plants, and every 15
[19:01.740 --> 19:07.340]  minutes, he measured the quantum yield of photosystem II, calculated the electron transport
[19:07.340 --> 19:08.940]  from that.
[19:08.940 --> 19:14.460]  And so when he took all of those data points, plotted them together, we see that with an
[19:14.500 --> 19:20.340]  increasing photosynthetic photon flux, the quantum yield of photosystem II decreases.
[19:20.340 --> 19:24.180]  So the more light you give a plant, the less efficiently it's being used.
[19:24.180 --> 19:25.860]  There's nothing new about this.
[19:25.860 --> 19:26.860]  This is well-known.
[19:26.860 --> 19:31.500]  I think we may be the first ones who have monitored this over such a long period and
[19:31.500 --> 19:33.100]  so frequently.
[19:33.100 --> 19:36.460]  This is not really what we were after.
[19:36.460 --> 19:40.660]  But an important take-home message here is that the more light a plant gets, the less
[19:40.660 --> 19:43.100]  efficiently it uses that light.
[19:43.100 --> 19:49.020]  We can use these data to calculate the electron transport rate, and we see an asymptotic increase
[19:49.020 --> 19:55.820]  in electron transport rate with an increase in photosynthetic photon flux, with an asymptote
[19:55.820 --> 20:01.620]  of about 130 micromoles of electrons per square meter per second.
[20:01.620 --> 20:07.300]  Overall, I'm actually surprised that every day we measure a different plant, that when
[20:07.300 --> 20:11.260]  we measure all of these different plants, it still follows that overall trend pretty
[20:11.260 --> 20:12.260]  nicely.
[20:13.100 --> 20:16.980]  So what we were really interested in was this graph.
[20:16.980 --> 20:21.740]  So on the y-axis, we have the daily photochemical integral.
[20:21.740 --> 20:25.580]  That's a term you've never heard of because we made it up.
[20:25.580 --> 20:30.420]  But what we did, very similar to the daily light integral, is over the course of an entire
[20:30.420 --> 20:37.460]  day, we integrated all of the electron transport rates to get to this daily photochemical integral.
[20:37.500 --> 20:42.900]  How many electrons are moved through photosystem II in one single day?
[20:42.900 --> 20:48.180]  And then we plotted that against the daily light integral, and once again, we get this
[20:48.180 --> 20:55.980]  asymptotic increase in daily photochemical integral with an increase in daily light integral.
[20:55.980 --> 21:01.940]  And what was interesting when we looked at these data is that when we look at 90% of
[21:01.940 --> 21:08.300]  the asymptote, which is about three moles of electron transport per day, and we look
[21:08.300 --> 21:15.260]  at the daily light integral that we need, and this was done with lattice, we get a daily
[21:15.260 --> 21:19.660]  light integral of 18 moles per square meter per day.
[21:19.660 --> 21:22.660]  So this took us 30 days to do.
[21:22.660 --> 21:29.900]  Cornell, using four, five years of data on growing lattice, drew the conclusion that
[21:29.940 --> 21:33.420]  for lattice you need 17 moles per square meter per day.
[21:33.420 --> 21:34.940]  So pretty much the same light level.
[21:34.940 --> 21:38.900]  So this correlates really well with what Cornell found.
[21:38.900 --> 21:47.220]  So we think that a daily photochemical integral of three is a really good target for growing
[21:47.220 --> 21:49.900]  lattice plants.
[21:49.900 --> 21:52.140]  And different crops are differently.
[21:52.140 --> 21:57.860]  So we did similar studies using impatience, which is a plant that typically grows in the
[21:57.860 --> 22:04.500]  shade, and so you see the same general decrease right here with increasing photosynthetic
[22:04.500 --> 22:06.380]  photon flux.
[22:06.380 --> 22:12.140]  And then we did geraniums, which is a high light plant, and you can see that with geraniums,
[22:12.140 --> 22:15.460]  the quantum efficiency or quantum yield of photosystem two is much higher.
[22:15.460 --> 22:22.300]  It is a plant that is adapted to high light levels, and it can use light more efficiently.
[22:22.300 --> 22:27.620]  So this in itself is not that shocking when we use the same data to calculate electron
[22:27.620 --> 22:28.620]  transport rates.
[22:28.620 --> 22:34.580]  You see that the sun-adapted geraniums can achieve much higher electron transport rates
[22:34.580 --> 22:37.620]  than the shade species impatience.
[22:37.620 --> 22:42.260]  So it's just important to keep in mind that there are big differences among species.
[22:42.260 --> 22:48.300]  This also has some interesting implications for how you're going to manage supplemental
[22:48.300 --> 22:49.300]  lighting.
[22:49.300 --> 22:54.380]  So let's say you're a grower and you have lights and you want to make sure that the
[22:54.380 --> 23:02.580]  light that you provide to your crop is going to be used with at least a 60% efficiency.
[23:02.580 --> 23:11.580]  Well, for impatience, that efficiency drops below 60% at a light level of about 150 microvolts
[23:11.580 --> 23:15.140]  per square metre per level, per second.
[23:15.140 --> 23:24.020]  For geranium, that efficiency doesn't drop below 60% or 0.6 until you get to a light
[23:24.020 --> 23:28.660]  level of about 530 micromoles per square metre per second.
[23:28.660 --> 23:33.340]  So that means that you might want to manage supplemental lighting for these two different
[23:33.340 --> 23:40.140]  species very differently based on the physiology of those plants.
[23:40.140 --> 23:46.700]  To show that a different way, for impatience, you wouldn't want to provide more supplemental
[23:46.700 --> 23:52.780]  light than to reach this level right here, 150 micromoles per square metre per day.
[23:52.780 --> 23:57.900]  While for geranium, you can go up to much higher light levels and the geraniums can
[23:57.900 --> 24:05.220]  still use that light that you're giving them efficiently for the light reactions of photosynthesis.
[24:05.940 --> 24:12.180]  In conclusion for this part, there are big differences among species.
[24:12.180 --> 24:16.220]  You should take that into account when you develop lighting strategies.
[24:16.220 --> 24:21.460]  The main take-home message that I want you to remember is that light is used most efficiently
[24:21.460 --> 24:24.540]  when PPF or light intensity is low.
[24:24.540 --> 24:28.500]  That means that you want to provide your supplemental lighting when there is little ambient light
[24:28.500 --> 24:30.060]  available.
[24:30.100 --> 24:36.660]  To illustrate that, this is a light response curve for electron transport rate of lattice.
[24:36.660 --> 24:41.900]  If you add 200 micromoles of supplemental light to lattice plants that are in the dark
[24:41.900 --> 24:46.460]  right here, you can increase the electron transport rate by about 60 micromoles per
[24:46.460 --> 24:48.860]  square metre per second.
[24:48.860 --> 24:54.300]  If you have 200 micromoles of sunlight and you add 200 micromoles of supplemental light,
[24:54.300 --> 24:59.500]  you only get an additional 40 micromoles per square metre per second of additional
[24:59.500 --> 25:02.980]  electron transport for the same amount of light that you're giving.
[25:02.980 --> 25:07.460]  The higher the ambient light level is, the less efficiently the crop is going to be able
[25:07.460 --> 25:11.180]  to use that.
[25:11.180 --> 25:17.180]  Because we know that plants use light more efficiently when you provide it at low light
[25:17.180 --> 25:24.180]  levels, we wanted to look at the effect of photoperiod on electron transport in lattice.
[25:24.180 --> 25:30.420]  Claudia Elkins, a new master student in my lab, just finished up a study where what she
[25:30.420 --> 25:37.460]  did was she provided a certain total amount of light, a certain daily light integral over
[25:37.460 --> 25:42.500]  a range of different photoperiods ranging from 7 to 22 hours.
[25:42.500 --> 25:50.500]  She tested this with two daily light integrals of 15 and 20 moles per square metre per day.
[25:50.500 --> 25:52.220]  This was done in growth chambers.
[25:52.260 --> 25:54.020]  There is a picture in a minute.
[25:54.020 --> 26:00.660]  But we had a data logger that made sure that we maintained the light level at a perfectly
[26:00.660 --> 26:04.460]  stable level over the entire photoperiod.
[26:04.460 --> 26:10.340]  And then Claudia collected chlorophyll fluorescence measurements every 15 minutes over the entire
[26:10.340 --> 26:11.340]  photoperiod.
[26:11.340 --> 26:16.100]  So this is an example of what that looked like inside of the growth chamber with the
[26:16.100 --> 26:20.620]  sensing head of the chlorophyll fluorometer right here.
[26:20.620 --> 26:27.060]  And so when you look at one day worth of data, this is average for a few replications,
[26:27.060 --> 26:31.340]  it looks something like this where typically early in the day when the lights just come
[26:31.340 --> 26:38.300]  on the electron transport rate tends to be pretty low and then it reaches a steady level
[26:38.300 --> 26:41.100]  after about 20 minutes or so.
[26:41.100 --> 26:43.900]  And there was actually not a whole lot of change after that.
[26:43.900 --> 26:48.220]  It becomes pretty boring when you measure this for hours in a row and the values come
[26:48.260 --> 26:50.980]  out the same every single time.
[26:50.980 --> 26:55.380]  So with these data what we could do then once again is calculate the daily photochemical
[26:55.380 --> 27:00.700]  integral, the area underneath this curve as well.
[27:00.700 --> 27:05.500]  But when we look at instantaneous quantum yield, and this is actually average over the
[27:05.500 --> 27:11.980]  entire photoperiod, and we plot that against the photosynthetic photon flux, we see once
[27:11.980 --> 27:17.980]  again just like in the greenhouse that we get a decrease in the quantum yield of photosystem
[27:18.740 --> 27:20.380]  with higher light levels.
[27:20.380 --> 27:25.580]  And so higher light levels are associated with shorter photoperiods because we had less
[27:25.580 --> 27:28.940]  time to provide these plants with the same amount of light.
[27:28.940 --> 27:34.620]  It doesn't matter for this relationship right here if the daily light integral that we achieved
[27:34.620 --> 27:40.380]  over the entire photoperiod was 15 or 20 moles per square meter per day.
[27:40.380 --> 27:47.860]  Really big change here in quantum yield from about 0.68 to about 0.28 at high light levels.
[27:47.860 --> 27:52.860]  So light had a tremendous effect on the quantum yield of photosystem too.
[27:52.860 --> 27:56.540]  And so much less efficient at higher light levels.
[27:56.540 --> 28:02.380]  And so we calculated electron transport rates and just like we saw in the greenhouse we
[28:02.380 --> 28:07.940]  got this asymptotic increase in electron transport rate with increasing photosynthetic photon
[28:07.940 --> 28:09.660]  flux.
[28:09.660 --> 28:15.420]  But what we were more interested in than the instantaneous values of quantum yield or electron
[28:15.460 --> 28:20.620]  transport is how do these treatments affect the daily photochemical integral?
[28:20.620 --> 28:27.100]  How much total electron transport can we get with a certain amount of light that we provide?
[28:27.100 --> 28:32.820]  So here we have the daily photochemical integral as a function of photoperiod.
[28:32.820 --> 28:38.620]  So you can think of photoperiod here as we go towards longer photoperiods, the instantaneous
[28:38.620 --> 28:40.580]  light level is lower.
[28:40.580 --> 28:45.380]  So all of these treatments over the course of the photoperiod got the same amount of
[28:45.380 --> 28:48.100]  light, DLI of 15.
[28:48.100 --> 28:53.500]  And keep in mind this is what we use in the greenhouse industry to make recommendations
[28:53.500 --> 28:56.780]  for light levels, how much light a crop needs.
[28:56.780 --> 29:03.340]  When we look at the daily photochemical integral it goes from about 2.6 to maybe 5.2 with the
[29:03.340 --> 29:05.300]  same amount of light.
[29:05.300 --> 29:13.180]  We get about twice as much electron transport if we provide that light over a longer period.
[29:13.180 --> 29:16.740]  So what that means is that not all photons are the same.
[29:16.740 --> 29:20.300]  The longer period you spread those photons out over, the more efficiently the plants
[29:20.300 --> 29:25.460]  use it and the more electron transport you get and presumably the more photosynthesis
[29:25.460 --> 29:28.580]  and the more growth you can get out of that.
[29:28.580 --> 29:33.300]  At a daily light integral of 20 moles per square metre per day the effect was even more
[29:33.300 --> 29:34.340]  pronounced.
[29:34.380 --> 29:40.820]  So the plants have much more electron transport with longer photoperiods without giving them
[29:40.820 --> 29:43.740]  more light.
[29:43.740 --> 29:51.500]  So the question after we found this is, does this actually matter from a practical perspective?
[29:51.500 --> 29:58.380]  Do you get better growth if you provide the same amount of light over a longer photoperiod?
[29:58.380 --> 30:03.020]  Because ultimately the growers that I work with don't seem to care very much about electron
[30:03.060 --> 30:05.180]  transport through photosystem II.
[30:05.180 --> 30:08.060]  I try to avoid that term when I talk to them.
[30:08.060 --> 30:10.980]  They want to see what impact that has on growth.
[30:10.980 --> 30:19.740]  So another new graduate student in my lab, Shane Palmer, he just finished up a study
[30:19.740 --> 30:25.700]  looking at the effects of photoperiod on the growth and some physiology of leafy greens
[30:25.700 --> 30:30.780]  produced inside of a vertical farm-like system.
[30:30.860 --> 30:37.900]  So his basic hypothesis was that longer photoperiods with a lower photosynthetic photon flux will
[30:37.900 --> 30:43.460]  result in more biomass, faster growth, than shorter photoperiods with high photosynthetic
[30:43.460 --> 30:49.420]  photon flux because plants can use lower light levels more efficiently.
[30:49.420 --> 30:53.260]  So he worked with Mizuna, which is a brassica.
[30:53.260 --> 30:59.020]  It's an interesting plant because it grows unbelievably fast.
[30:59.020 --> 31:01.300]  He suggested that we use that crop.
[31:01.300 --> 31:06.620]  He had worked previously at Kennedy Space Center growing Mizuna.
[31:06.620 --> 31:08.220]  And then we have lettuce here.
[31:08.220 --> 31:11.660]  He also worked with basil, but we don't have those data yet.
[31:11.660 --> 31:18.980]  But we grew these inside of a controlled environment chamber, walk-in chamber, 20 degrees C, CO2
[31:18.980 --> 31:19.980]  enrichment.
[31:19.980 --> 31:25.420]  We used white LEDs in all plants, received a daily light integral of 16 moles per square
[31:25.420 --> 31:32.420]  meter per day, but provided over six different photoperiods ranging from 10 to 20 hours.
[31:32.420 --> 31:37.380]  And so to summarize the treatments, so we have the photoperiods here.
[31:37.380 --> 31:42.460]  So we go from 10 to 20 hours, and that meant that the photosynthetic photon flux ranged
[31:42.460 --> 31:49.980]  from 220 to 444 micromoles per square meter per day per second to make sure that all of
[31:49.980 --> 31:57.540]  these plants received the same amount of light.
[31:57.540 --> 32:02.620]  And this graph doesn't look very good, but I haven't had a chance yet to get my hands
[32:02.620 --> 32:03.660]  on the raw data.
[32:03.660 --> 32:09.340]  But he measured light interception by the Mizuna over the course of this study.
[32:09.340 --> 32:13.380]  And I just want to draw your attention to the middle part of this graph, where you can
[32:13.380 --> 32:19.940]  see right here this teal, greenish colored line are the plants grown under the longest
[32:19.940 --> 32:21.540]  photoperiod.
[32:21.540 --> 32:27.060]  And the red and blue right here are the plants grown under the two shortest photoperiods.
[32:27.060 --> 32:33.420]  So we saw halfway through the study that the plants grown under longer photoperiods were
[32:33.420 --> 32:37.080]  intercepting more of the light.
[32:37.080 --> 32:39.740]  And that may suggest that the plants were bigger.
[32:39.740 --> 32:44.060]  But it was also interesting to see that the morphology of the plants was really different
[32:44.060 --> 32:48.900]  depending on the photoperiod, because the plants that were grown under long photoperiods
[32:48.900 --> 32:53.660]  and low instantaneous light levels, they were spreading their leaves out.
[32:53.660 --> 32:58.380]  And they looked like solar panels that were deployed to try to capture as much light as
[32:58.380 --> 33:05.180]  possible, while the plants that were grown with the short photoperiods and high instantaneous
[33:05.180 --> 33:07.720]  light level, they were like this.
[33:07.720 --> 33:08.720]  They didn't want light.
[33:08.720 --> 33:11.160]  They seemed to be avoiding light.
[33:11.160 --> 33:14.280]  And that's not just reflected in the morphology of the plants.
[33:14.280 --> 33:18.480]  When we looked at chlorophyll levels in these plants, and we just used a non-destructive
[33:18.480 --> 33:20.960]  meter, we didn't do a true quantification.
[33:20.960 --> 33:26.460]  But we have the chlorophyll content index as a function of photoperiods.
[33:26.460 --> 33:31.960]  So the plants grown with short photoperiods, high light intensity, had much less chlorophyll
[33:31.960 --> 33:36.320]  than plants grown with long photoperiods, low light intensity.
[33:36.320 --> 33:42.360]  So that's consistent with the idea that these plants were trying to capture as much light
[33:42.360 --> 33:47.000]  energy as they possibly could.
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.680]  And then we measured the quantum yield of photosystem II.
[33:51.680 --> 33:57.860]  And we see that with high light intensity, short photoperiod, the quantum yield is significantly
[33:57.860 --> 34:05.260]  lower than it is with long photoperiods and low light intensities.
[34:05.260 --> 34:10.420]  But when you look at the differences between treatments here and here, these differences
[34:10.420 --> 34:16.060]  are much, much smaller than they were in the previous study that was done by Claudia Elkins
[34:16.060 --> 34:17.060]  that I showed.
[34:17.060 --> 34:18.960]  She saw much bigger effects.
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.520]  And that is probably because these plants were grown constantly under these different
[34:23.520 --> 34:24.520]  light levels.
[34:24.520 --> 34:27.820]  And they had a chance to acclimate to those specific light levels.
[34:27.820 --> 34:32.800]  Claudia grew all of her plants under one light level and then exposed them to a different
[34:32.800 --> 34:33.800]  light level.
[34:33.800 --> 34:36.120]  And these plants weren't acclimated to the conditions.
[34:36.120 --> 34:38.700]  So much smaller effect here.
[34:38.700 --> 34:40.440]  And then he collected dry weight data.
[34:40.440 --> 34:47.640]  And we see a general trend towards increased dry weight in Missoula with longer photoperiods,
[34:47.640 --> 34:49.360]  28% increase.
[34:49.360 --> 34:50.820]  That's actually pretty substantial.
[34:50.820 --> 34:53.780]  But there was unfortunately a lot of variability.
[34:53.780 --> 34:56.820]  So it wasn't quite statistically significant.
[34:56.820 --> 35:01.480]  And so when I was working on this presentation early last week, I looked at this and I thought,
[35:01.480 --> 35:03.260]  well, that's a bummer.
[35:03.260 --> 35:09.500]  And so last Friday, Shane weighed the lettuce plants for me so that I could look at those
[35:09.500 --> 35:10.500]  data.
[35:10.500 --> 35:14.540]  And for lettuce, we see a smaller absolute increase.
[35:14.540 --> 35:19.140]  But for lettuce, we do see a significant increase in the dry weight of the plants as we grow
[35:19.140 --> 35:21.420]  them with longer photoperiods.
[35:21.420 --> 35:26.060]  And again, just want to reemphasize, all of these plants got the same amount of light.
[35:26.060 --> 35:31.460]  So that suggests that daily light integral in itself may not be all that useful as a
[35:31.660 --> 35:34.820]  predictor of crop growth.
[35:34.820 --> 35:41.660]  So longer photoperiod resulted in, A, more light interception, higher quantum yield of
[35:41.660 --> 35:43.880]  photosystem II, so combined.
[35:43.880 --> 35:48.300]  That means a lot more electron transport, a lot more light energy harvested.
[35:48.300 --> 35:54.060]  And for lettuce, a significant effect for Missoula and closely significant effect on
[35:54.060 --> 35:55.440]  the biomass of the plant.
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.980]  So I actually think that looks pretty promising.
[35:57.980 --> 36:03.940]  And hopefully next week we'll have the basal data as well to go with this.
[36:03.940 --> 36:04.940]  So this was indoors.
[36:04.940 --> 36:10.220]  And I mentioned earlier, I'm actually getting more and more interested in greenhouses, right,
[36:10.220 --> 36:12.860]  because greenhouses have this dynamic light environment.
[36:12.860 --> 36:20.260]  So Jeff Weaver, who I mentioned previously, this spring did a study where he looked at
[36:20.260 --> 36:24.460]  the effect of photoperiod on the growth of greenhouse-grown lettuce.
[36:24.500 --> 36:27.900]  And so in his study too, we wanted to make sure that all of these plants got the same
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.780]  daily light integral.
[36:29.780 --> 36:34.500]  That is really easy to do when you're in an indoor environment and you don't have to worry
[36:34.500 --> 36:35.500]  about the sun.
[36:35.500 --> 36:41.140]  It becomes a lot more difficult in a greenhouse where you don't know how much sunlight you're
[36:41.140 --> 36:43.360]  going to get over the course of the day.
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.900]  So how do we actually make sure that all of these plants get the same amount of light
[36:48.900 --> 36:54.100]  by the end of the day with a highly variable background from minute to minute and day to
[36:54.100 --> 36:56.940]  day in the amount of sunlight?
[36:56.940 --> 37:05.100]  So we have developed a light and control system that can do that for us.
[37:05.100 --> 37:10.820]  In my spare time, I like to pretend that I'm an engineer and I like to put things together.
[37:10.820 --> 37:14.380]  This actually came out of a class project where I told the previous graduate student
[37:14.380 --> 37:18.320]  in the lab, David Giannino, this is your project for this class.
[37:18.320 --> 37:19.540]  You go build it.
[37:19.540 --> 37:26.640]  And so what we do is we measure the photosynthetic photon flux density at the canopy level using
[37:26.640 --> 37:27.920]  a data logger.
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.240]  And then we want to control the amount of light that we provide using LEDs based on
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.240]  how much light the crop is actually receiving.
[37:36.240 --> 37:42.560]  So we can use this system to either make sure that the plants get a completely stable photosynthetic
[37:42.720 --> 37:48.440]  photon flux density all day long, or we can use this to make sure that by the end of the
[37:48.440 --> 37:53.480]  photo period, the plants have received a specific daily light integral.
[37:53.480 --> 37:56.640]  And I'll show you in a few minutes how we actually do that.
[37:56.640 --> 38:00.480]  But the principle is actually pretty simple.
[38:00.480 --> 38:03.880]  So we have a light, an LED light right here.
[38:03.880 --> 38:09.520]  We have the sun, a quantum sensor, a data logger, and the dimmable driver.
[38:10.240 --> 38:14.360]  This right here is the beauty of LEDs.
[38:14.360 --> 38:20.680]  You can dim LEDs very, very accurately and instantaneously, and it doesn't affect the
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.200]  longevity of the LEDs.
[38:22.200 --> 38:26.760]  So in a matter of microseconds, if you want, you can completely change the light output
[38:26.760 --> 38:30.480]  from LED lights, and it is really easy to do.
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.360]  I probably shouldn't tell people that it is easy.
[38:32.360 --> 38:34.120]  I should pretend this is really difficult.
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.760]  But in reality, it's actually pretty simple.
[38:37.760 --> 38:43.200]  So when you have a certain amount of sunlight, the quantum sensor measures that, signal goes
[38:43.200 --> 38:47.600]  to the data logger, and then the data logger calculates how much supplemental light do
[38:47.600 --> 38:53.160]  we need to provide from the LED, and that allows us to give a specific amount of light
[38:53.160 --> 38:53.680]  to the crop.
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.360]  So when the sun gets brighter, the LED is automatically dim.
[39:00.360 --> 39:11.360]  And so in this particular study, Jeff grew lettuce, green towers, and regular greenhouse
[39:11.360 --> 39:15.520]  trays one week after the seedlings germinated.
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.720]  He started the lighting treatments and grew the plants for 22 days under supplemental
[39:20.720 --> 39:23.560]  light.
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.720]  All treatments received a daily light integral of 17 moles per square meter per day based
[39:28.720 --> 39:31.840]  on the Cornell recommendations.
[39:31.840 --> 39:38.400]  But they got that light in photo periods that ranged from 12 to 21 hours.
[39:38.400 --> 39:45.120]  We had a control treatment that, on average, received about 8 moles per square meter per
[39:45.120 --> 39:46.120]  day.
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.600]  And I could have put standard deviations with these treatments.
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.480]  But so the plants in these treatments that received 17 moles per square meter per day,
[39:55.480 --> 40:01.680]  the standard deviation on 17 moles was, I believe, 50 micromoles or something like that.
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.440]  The inaccuracies that we have in this control system are much more related to any inaccuracies
[40:07.440 --> 40:10.760]  that we may have in the light sensor itself than in our control.
[40:10.760 --> 40:13.920]  We can't control the light perfectly.
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.800]  So we measure the light level every two seconds because that's the fastest the data logger
[40:17.800 --> 40:20.440]  can do everything it needs to do.
[40:20.520 --> 40:27.680]  So every two seconds, the data logger calculates a new lighting threshold that we want to maintain.
[40:27.680 --> 40:32.880]  So by the end of the day, we want to have 17 million micromoles.
[40:32.880 --> 40:37.280]  We subtract from that how much light the crop has already received.
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.400]  So now we know how much more light needs to be provided over the rest of the photo period.
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.560]  And we divide that by the amount of time that is left in the photo period.
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.760]  And so now the data logger knows how much light the crop needs to receive, and it can
[40:51.760 --> 40:53.960]  control the LEDs to make sure that that happens.
[40:53.960 --> 40:58.600]  So this is just a picture of what that looks like in the greenhouse.
[40:58.600 --> 41:07.400]  So we have the light sensor right here, light bars donated by Fluence Bioengineering.
[41:07.400 --> 41:09.760]  This is a picture of the whole setup at night.
[41:09.760 --> 41:11.200]  No plans in this case.
[41:11.200 --> 41:15.880]  Jeff just took this picture to show that you can see the different amounts of light that
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.800]  are provided by the LEDs in the different treatments.
[41:20.800 --> 41:26.400]  So this is a picture near the end of the study of plants that were grown with 12 and 15 hour
[41:26.400 --> 41:27.400]  photo periods.
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.760]  So the light level here in general was higher than here.
[41:30.760 --> 41:31.960]  And I hope you can see that.
[41:31.960 --> 41:37.600]  But here too we saw that the chlorophyll content in these plants grown under shorter photo
[41:37.600 --> 41:44.120]  periods and higher light levels were actually lower than in plants grown with longer photo
[41:44.120 --> 41:45.120]  periods.
[41:45.360 --> 41:49.200]  So this is very similar to what we saw indoors.
[41:49.200 --> 41:55.440]  And so I don't have all of the data from this study yet, but Jeff has the dry weight data
[41:55.440 --> 41:57.120]  for this.
[41:57.120 --> 42:00.760]  So the plants that were grown without any supplemental lighting, they looked absolutely
[42:00.760 --> 42:01.760]  horrible.
[42:01.760 --> 42:05.640]  Their dry weight was really, really low.
[42:05.640 --> 42:07.480]  We weren't really interested in the treatment.
[42:07.480 --> 42:09.160]  It's just a reference for everything else.
[42:09.160 --> 42:14.560]  But so with supplemental lighting and again all the same daily light integral, we can
[42:14.560 --> 42:22.480]  see that with longer photo periods there was an increase in the biomass of these plants.
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.720]  And in this case we saw a 43% increase in biomass just by providing the supplemental
[42:28.720 --> 42:32.760]  light over longer photo periods.
[42:32.760 --> 42:41.680]  So I'm pretty excited about this because that's a very large growth increase.
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.760]  And it has lots of practical applications for managing supplemental light.
[42:45.760 --> 42:51.240]  So if you have a crop that is photo period insensitive, you really should be spreading
[42:51.240 --> 42:56.120]  out the supplemental light over as long a period as you can.
[42:56.120 --> 42:57.560]  And in some cases you can go up.
[42:57.560 --> 43:03.800]  In many cases you can actually provide light over 24-hour periods if you choose to do so.
[43:03.800 --> 43:09.800]  The advantage or an other advantage of providing lower instantaneous light levels over longer
[43:09.880 --> 43:14.320]  photo periods is that you can install a smaller lighting system because you don't need the
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.000]  same power to provide high levels of instantaneous light.
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.520]  So it actually makes the whole installation of a lighting system cheaper if you can spread
[43:23.520 --> 43:25.760]  your light out over longer photo periods.
[43:25.760 --> 43:27.880]  So it's not just the physiology that makes sense.
[43:27.880 --> 43:34.160]  It actually I think has direct business implications as well.
[43:34.160 --> 43:37.200]  And so I'm a big believer in this company.
[43:37.200 --> 43:43.800]  So shameless self-promotion, I recently started a company with a friend of mine and we just
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.920]  got a USDA grant to actually develop a lighting controller that can automatically implement
[43:48.920 --> 43:52.040]  these kind of lighting strategies for you.
[43:52.040 --> 43:55.880]  So this is our prototype control system.
[43:55.880 --> 43:59.360]  There is a light sensor I believe right here.
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.600]  And then I have no idea what the rest of that stuff is, but it works.
[44:03.600 --> 44:09.880]  So with this what you can do using your phone and Bluetooth, you can tell the controller
[44:09.880 --> 44:14.840]  I want this daily light integral, I want this photo period, and then you walk away from
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.600]  it and the controller will actually then take care of managing the lights for you.
[44:20.600 --> 44:28.600]  So overall conclusions of this, longer photo periods have interesting physiological effects,
[44:28.600 --> 44:33.360]  higher quantum yield, greater electron transport rate over the course of the entire day.
[44:33.400 --> 44:36.520]  So a greater daily photochemical index.
[44:36.520 --> 44:41.680]  Increased light interception because of morphological responses, at least partly morphological responses
[44:41.680 --> 44:43.360]  to low light.
[44:43.360 --> 44:49.280]  But from a practical perspective, that also results in faster growth.
[44:49.280 --> 44:55.160]  So what we were able to do in this series of studies is starting with basic physiological
[44:55.160 --> 45:01.880]  measurements trying to understand how plants use light and the light reactions of photosynthesis,
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.200]  but subsequently actually then come up with practical recommendations and even a commercial
[45:07.200 --> 45:14.040]  product that came out of this that can now implement or take advantage of the physiological
[45:14.040 --> 45:16.760]  knowledge in a production setting.
[45:16.760 --> 45:18.760]  And with that I'm going to wrap it up.
[45:18.760 --> 45:25.120]  I would like to thank the companies and agencies that have funded this work and I would be
[45:25.120 --> 45:27.600]  glad to take any questions.
