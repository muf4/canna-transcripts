[00:00.000 --> 00:10.200]  number five. Now we are finally moving past just radiation into the next
[00:10.200 --> 00:16.080]  component of this whole thing. In this outline we're at number five.
[00:16.080 --> 00:20.480]  Now these are complex lectures. It looks like we're half done but we're really
[00:20.480 --> 00:26.440]  more like two-thirds or three-fourths done in this. Transpiration all by
[00:26.440 --> 00:32.200]  itself. As I said before we talked about doing that by subtraction. Can't we just
[00:32.200 --> 00:36.440]  measure it directly? And the answer is yes, sort of. And that's what I want to
[00:36.440 --> 00:40.560]  talk about is how we can do transpiration as a direct measurement.
[00:40.560 --> 00:45.200]  Now the first thing you run into when you we've simplified this thing because
[00:45.200 --> 00:50.320]  we've got all this other stuff feeding into this one number right here is
[00:50.320 --> 00:56.320]  latent heat and sensible heat. You hear those terms all the time and
[00:56.320 --> 01:02.600]  it's easy to get them confused. Latent heat always refers to evaporation of
[01:02.600 --> 01:10.600]  water for cooling and sensible heat just means dry heat. There's no water involved.
[01:10.600 --> 01:17.920]  So where did we come up with these terms? I haven't studied the etiology of them
[01:18.160 --> 01:25.200]  but sensible heat makes sense. Hot objects cool, they get cooler. That's easy
[01:25.200 --> 01:33.960]  to understand so it's sensible. Latent heat, the object sitting there and you
[01:33.960 --> 01:39.320]  shine a much brighter light on it and the temperature doesn't change. That
[01:39.320 --> 01:45.160]  doesn't make sense. It can't be sensible heat. It only changes temperature after
[01:45.200 --> 01:49.920]  the water evaporates. The water evaporates and then it cools so it's
[01:49.920 --> 01:55.760]  latent. It's after the fact, the cooling. That helps to keep these terms
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.680]  because you get into this business and people quickly start throwing these
[01:59.680 --> 02:07.160]  terms around and you want to keep up with the conversation. Both of these are
[02:07.160 --> 02:17.520]  governed by the exact same basic principle. Flux is driving gradient by
[02:17.520 --> 02:31.400]  resistance. In the case of latent heat, the flux is transpiration. We'll put
[02:31.400 --> 02:44.400]  grams of water per meter squared per second equals a dimensionless driving
[02:44.400 --> 02:53.680]  gradient, so DG over resistance. The resistance is the stomates. Are they
[02:53.680 --> 02:59.320]  closed? Are they open? How open are the stomates? It's just a ratio of these
[02:59.400 --> 03:06.680]  two things that quantitatively determine transpiration. Then remember, as
[03:06.680 --> 03:13.520]  soon as we do weight of water through that 2.45 megajoules per liter that
[03:13.520 --> 03:20.680]  you're all remembering, we get milliliters of water per meter squared
[03:20.680 --> 03:31.280]  per second or we get joules of energy. Sensible heat, same thing only we get
[03:31.280 --> 03:41.000]  joules of cooling. Now the denominator here is Delta T. It's just simple. It's
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.840]  just the temperature between the two objects. Similarly, this is divided by
[03:47.920 --> 03:53.760]  resistance. Only over here, mostly this resistance is how fast the wind is
[03:53.760 --> 04:00.200]  blowing. This is a dominant factor here. This resistance is how open the stomates
[04:00.200 --> 04:09.120]  are to let the water vapor out. The concepts are exactly the same. Now
[04:09.120 --> 04:16.400]  what we want to start with is this driving gradient right here. We'll
[04:16.400 --> 04:24.360]  erase that. We're coming to that. Let me erase all of this. How do we calculate
[04:24.360 --> 04:30.920]  that driving gradient? If you ask most people, they would say well duh, how easy
[04:30.920 --> 04:39.360]  is that? It's relative humidity. Most people think this is relative
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.080]  humidity on this. If the relative humidity is low, stuff evaporates
[04:44.160 --> 04:51.200]  faster. If it's high, it evaporates slower. But it's not relative humidity, it's
[04:51.200 --> 04:57.840]  absolute humidity. This gets back and forth for all kinds of gases.
[04:57.840 --> 05:04.360]  Absolute humidity is the absolute number of water vapor molecules in the air.
[05:04.360 --> 05:11.120]  That's pretty simple. Relative is the ratio of how much water is in the air
[05:11.320 --> 05:19.320]  divided by what it could hold. If the air is hot, it can hold a lot of water
[05:19.320 --> 05:28.720]  vapor and the relative humidity goes down. In this room, if we had a hundred
[05:28.720 --> 05:36.480]  water vapor molecules and the humidity was 50%, if we heated up the room we
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.400]  would still have a hundred water vapor molecules and the humidity
[05:40.400 --> 05:46.520]  might be 10% because the air could hold more water. This distinction is
[05:46.520 --> 05:54.440]  critical in intuitively understanding the driving gradient for this. The
[05:54.440 --> 06:05.440]  best way that I have seen to explain this is a thing called the psychrometric
[06:05.440 --> 06:12.520]  chart. Some of you may have seen this.
[06:16.800 --> 06:24.720]  I think maybe I don't have plenty. I thought I had plenty. You
[06:24.720 --> 06:30.160]  could take two of these. One to write on, one to keep. If you type psychrometric
[06:30.160 --> 06:37.040]  chart on the internet, you're going to get hundreds and hundreds of versions of
[06:37.160 --> 06:49.440]  this chart in metric units and old English units. This is the standard
[06:49.440 --> 06:58.640]  chart for standard temperatures. The x-axis is air temperature. It goes from
[06:58.640 --> 07:03.240]  minus 20 to plus 50 on this chart. We've pretty much covered the
[07:03.240 --> 07:08.280]  environmental range on this chart. Never mind this little subsection right here.
[07:08.280 --> 07:20.600]  Let's focus on this for starters. This shows five parameters of water vapor in
[07:20.600 --> 07:27.120]  the air and if you know any two of those five you can calculate the other three.
[07:27.120 --> 07:40.760]  I can't quite write on this screen but I can draw it on here. I'm going to
[07:40.760 --> 07:45.960]  simulate this and sometimes the simulation is good because it'll be more
[07:45.960 --> 07:56.040]  simple. Here's the basic chart. These tick marks down here are air temperature
[07:56.040 --> 08:03.040]  and almost always in practice that's one of the things you know. Usually you
[08:03.040 --> 08:06.720]  don't measure water vapor to back calculate air temperature. Most of the time you know
[08:06.720 --> 08:20.960]  that. These curves here in the middle are relative humidity RH. All these curve
[08:20.960 --> 08:26.320]  lines like this. Let's take an example where we know air temperature and
[08:26.320 --> 08:34.000]  humidity and see what we can calculate from that. Let's say this room is 25 C
[08:34.000 --> 08:48.940]  and the humidity is 30%. This is Utah, it's dry air. If we go on this chart and
[08:48.940 --> 08:59.220]  find 30%, here's 25 C. Now the important line is just a tiny bit past the
[08:59.220 --> 09:06.940]  number. It's a tiny bit boldface and we go up, up, up, up, up, up, until we get to 30. Right
[09:06.940 --> 09:13.420]  there is the point. Now that you want to draw a dot where those humidity and
[09:13.420 --> 09:25.180]  temperature intersect. I'll draw it on here. If we go to the right in a
[09:25.180 --> 09:33.220]  straight line, let me simplify this a little, right here and we find the tick
[09:33.220 --> 09:37.660]  mark on the right hand side of the graph from this going right straight across.
[09:37.660 --> 09:44.780]  Let me see if I can do this right on the screen. 25 and 30. If I go right
[09:44.780 --> 09:59.300]  straight across I'm getting 7. I'm getting a little more than that.
[09:59.460 --> 10:08.580]  I'm getting seven and a half for the going right straight across. You can see
[10:08.580 --> 10:18.860]  what the units are of that. Absolute humidity grams per kilogram of air. Very
[10:18.860 --> 10:30.500]  different unit than relative humidity. At our elevation, this is not on this
[10:30.500 --> 10:40.340]  chart, but at our elevation at 1,500 meters. By the way, this is a chart for
[10:40.340 --> 10:46.380]  our elevation. This is for 1,500 meters. We've made this just for
[10:46.380 --> 11:01.940]  this class. One kilogram of air equals one cubic meter of air. This is also
[11:01.940 --> 11:12.380]  7.5 grams per cubic meter, but only in Logan. Sea level, this is 1.2
[11:12.380 --> 11:18.780]  kilograms per cubic meter. This same chart is available for all different
[11:18.780 --> 11:23.340]  elevations and they are very similar. If I overlaid them on here, if you
[11:23.340 --> 11:26.980]  looked at two you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. If you lay them on
[11:26.980 --> 11:30.820]  top of each other you can see little differences, but the biggest differences
[11:30.820 --> 11:37.380]  is the density of the air. This grams per kilogram is valid for all
[11:37.380 --> 11:42.460]  different elevations. This is the absolute humidity, how much water vapor
[11:42.460 --> 11:47.540]  is in the air. If we took a cubic meter of air and condensed all the water out
[11:47.540 --> 11:53.140]  of it, cubic meters pretty big, we'd only get 7.5 grams of water. That's the
[11:53.140 --> 12:01.900]  absolute humidity. If you look carefully over here, the second column is dew point
[12:01.900 --> 12:15.100]  temperature. I promised five things from this, so here's one air temperature, two is
[12:15.100 --> 12:20.620]  relative humidity, three is absolute humidity,
[12:20.620 --> 12:33.220]  the fourth one goes this direction right from that point and it's
[12:33.220 --> 12:41.220]  where this intersects this curve right here. Then you take that
[12:41.220 --> 12:48.420]  point and go down to the temperature. The temperature is listed both on this
[12:48.420 --> 12:57.060]  and this, but this point right here is the dew point of the air.
[12:57.060 --> 13:05.460]  We're number four dew point of the air. This is a very big deal
[13:05.460 --> 13:14.780]  because this is where water changes state from a gas to a liquid. If we are
[13:14.780 --> 13:19.460]  below the dew point, the water is going to just keep condensing on that surface
[13:19.460 --> 13:24.220]  and actually until the surface finally warms up. That's how air
[13:24.220 --> 13:28.500]  conditioners work. They have a cold surface and the water condenses and takes it
[13:28.500 --> 13:34.020]  out of the air. If it's above this point, water will never condense on that
[13:34.020 --> 13:41.020]  surface. What do we get for dew point here if you're following along 25 and
[13:41.020 --> 13:54.220]  30. Looks like I'm getting about six or seven degrees.
[13:54.220 --> 14:07.460]  Let's call this
[14:07.460 --> 14:19.700]  6 degrees C for our example. What if we take a can of soda or beer out of the
[14:19.700 --> 14:24.620]  fridge and let it sit in this room. What's the temperature of a refrigerator?
[14:24.620 --> 14:33.100]  3, 2, 3, 4 degrees C. Water is going to condense on it because it's below the
[14:33.100 --> 14:39.460]  dew point of the air. After a few minutes it warms up and that water
[14:39.460 --> 14:43.940]  evaporates again and there's no water condensing on it. That's the concept of
[14:43.940 --> 14:51.780]  dew point of the air. You get up in the morning of a cold winter night and
[14:51.780 --> 14:56.980]  water is condensing on your windows. That's because the window temperature is
[14:56.980 --> 15:03.340]  below the dew point of the air. You get condensation on it. In the case of
[15:03.340 --> 15:09.940]  leaves, they can cool at night below the dew point and water
[15:09.940 --> 15:15.700]  condenses on leaves. That's bad news because bacteria go wild when there's
[15:15.700 --> 15:22.340]  water condensed on leaves. Our models make all these measurements, calculate
[15:22.340 --> 15:26.700]  dew point and particularly the dew point of the leaves. If water is condensing,
[15:27.180 --> 15:31.980]  we send a red alert to the plant pathologists and people and they have
[15:31.980 --> 15:37.500]  disease forecasts based on the number of hours below the dew point of the air.
[15:37.500 --> 15:45.180]  It's based on other measurements and a calculated dew point. I'm going to come back
[15:45.180 --> 15:49.860]  to the value of each of these parameters in a minute. First, I promise five
[15:49.860 --> 15:58.260]  things. The fifth one is shown here. There's no tick marks on this. See these
[15:58.260 --> 16:05.500]  lines go in the opposite direction of everything? This we can go right up here.
[16:05.500 --> 16:15.540]  The relative humidity is 2. We go right up here and this temperature is the wet bulb
[16:15.540 --> 16:29.830]  temperature right there. These all go both ways. If you know this, you go this way.
[16:29.830 --> 16:36.310]  These are all double-ended arrows. What good is the wet bulb temperature?
[16:36.310 --> 16:43.750]  What does that mean? This means the temperature that a wet surface would get
[16:43.750 --> 16:53.110]  to in these conditions. If it's a wet dish rag, fully wet, and it's
[16:53.110 --> 16:58.390]  evaporating like crazy, how cold would it get? Let's see if we can calculate
[16:58.390 --> 17:07.790]  wet bulb from this. 25 up to 30. Now we go this way and it looks like the wet bulb
[17:07.790 --> 17:25.550]  temperature is about 13.5. In these conditions, 13.5 C. What this means is a
[17:25.550 --> 17:31.230]  wet dish rag would cool to 13.5 C and as long as it stayed wet it would stay at
[17:31.230 --> 17:39.390]  this temperature. Well irrigated leaves could get to this temperature too. If
[17:39.390 --> 17:44.510]  they act like a wet dish rag, they could cool to this. Look at the air
[17:44.510 --> 17:51.230]  temperature is 25 and a wet surface would cool to roughly 13. That's a lot
[17:51.230 --> 17:56.790]  of cooling, but it's low humidity. You can quickly run the model and say,
[17:56.790 --> 18:04.830]  what would it be if it was 80% humidity? All we have to do is go up to 80 up
[18:04.830 --> 18:10.870]  here and now the wet bulb temperature is something like 22. It's much closer to
[18:10.870 --> 18:17.670]  air temperature. The dew point is something like 21 if we move up
[18:17.670 --> 18:24.230]  here in this humidity line. The absolute humidity is a function of both
[18:24.390 --> 18:30.390]  relative humidity and temperature. Now what we want to calculate is not just
[18:30.390 --> 18:39.910]  absolute humidity, but this driving gradient. The driving gradient is,
[18:39.910 --> 18:46.910]  let me draw this right here in green.
[18:46.910 --> 18:59.700]  This is a picture of one stomate, a giant stomate on the bottom of a leaf.
[18:59.700 --> 19:05.420]  Remember we drew this the other day. We had various cells out here. Here's the
[19:05.420 --> 19:12.940]  whole leaf with all the cells. Now there's two cells right here that are
[19:12.940 --> 19:17.260]  called guard cells and they're just exactly like a port with ships going in
[19:17.300 --> 19:21.780]  and out. These guard cells are always going back and forth to restrict the
[19:21.780 --> 19:30.980]  size of this opening. The driving gradient for humidity, I'm going to put
[19:30.980 --> 19:42.420]  H. I could say AH. Let me say AH. Absolute humidity, I, inside the leaf to
[19:42.420 --> 19:53.030]  absolute humidity in the air. This one is not difficult to get. We put our
[19:53.030 --> 19:57.670]  instruments on it and usually we're getting relative humidity and
[19:57.670 --> 20:03.110]  temperature going this way and inside the data logger and we're calculating
[20:03.110 --> 20:10.310]  this absolute humidity. So we know this one. How do we get humidity inside the leaf?
[20:10.470 --> 20:22.350]  We know that any leaf that is not wilted, that is hydrated, is 100% relative
[20:22.350 --> 20:32.710]  humidity. It might be 99% but it's very close to 100%. Now if we know leaf
[20:32.710 --> 20:38.790]  temperature, and for this example let's say that the leaf temperature, the air is
[20:38.830 --> 20:45.910]  25. We just did that. Now let's say the leaf is 25. These happen to be at the
[20:45.910 --> 20:52.790]  exact same temperature in this example. Now we can go from air temperature here
[20:52.790 --> 21:01.430]  straight up to 100% humidity. The leaf is the same temperature so our leaf
[21:01.430 --> 21:13.910]  right here, is right there. Now we go from the leaf over here and we get a
[21:13.910 --> 21:19.310]  number for the absolute humidity, the water vapor density inside that leaf.
[21:19.310 --> 21:22.310]  Let's see if we can do that in this example.
[21:23.310 --> 21:33.860]  I'm right here. I can take the tick mark right off of this. It's the
[21:33.860 --> 21:40.140]  same tick mark. I go over here straight across and I'm getting 24.2 maybe.
[21:40.140 --> 21:45.220]  If the leaf is 100% humidity, this line right here is 100% humidity.
[21:45.220 --> 21:58.340]  We're getting 24.2 inside the leaf. Now we have, get rid of our 100%,
[21:58.340 --> 22:22.500]  24.2 and the air is 7.5. This driving gradient is 24.2 minus 7.5 with units of
[22:22.500 --> 22:29.500]  grams per kilogram.
[22:29.500 --> 22:39.540]  Whatever this subtraction is exactly, what is that 16 or something, 17, about
[22:39.540 --> 22:47.700]  17 grams per kilogram. That is the absolute of humidity inside the leaf
[22:47.700 --> 22:52.860]  minus the absolute humidity air. That's the driving gradient for transpiration.
[22:52.860 --> 22:59.580]  Now what if the leaf starts to run out of water? Just a little bit. It's not as
[22:59.580 --> 23:05.660]  well hydrated. It can't keep up. It can't balance the energy by
[23:05.660 --> 23:11.660]  evaporating water. The leaf gets hotter. Let's say the leaf gets three degrees
[23:11.660 --> 23:17.380]  hotter than the air. It's not wilted yet. It's just not. The stomates are
[23:17.380 --> 23:29.100]  starting to close. Now we can do 25, 26, 27, 28 degrees C. Still 100% humidity.
[23:29.100 --> 23:41.380]  Now we're at 29 inside the leaf if it heats up. Hot leaf, not hot, warm leaf.
[23:41.380 --> 23:48.420]  The air is still the same, 29 minus 7.5. As soon as the leaf gets hotter, the
[23:48.420 --> 23:54.060]  driving gradient gets bigger. Now it is possible for really wet leaves to get
[23:54.060 --> 23:58.100]  below air temperature because of that wet bulb. They might get all the way down to
[23:58.100 --> 24:03.340]  the wet bulb, but even there there's a gradient for transpiration. This
[24:03.340 --> 24:10.860]  gradient for transpiration, and I'm going to show this in red, is always this.
[24:10.860 --> 24:19.820]  Difference right here between 100% humidity in the leaf and wherever our
[24:19.820 --> 24:28.060]  point is here in the air. There's plenty of computer programs to put stuff in and
[24:28.060 --> 24:33.020]  calculate this stuff. Free programs, psychometric programs. You used to have to pay
[24:33.020 --> 24:38.100]  for them and now they're free on the internet. None of those. You can use
[24:38.100 --> 24:42.380]  those all day long and you don't see the graphical principles the way you get
[24:42.380 --> 24:47.860]  them with a psychometric chart. Once you see the chart you can understand
[24:47.860 --> 24:53.860]  how these points move to make this absolute humidity change. Leaf cooling,
[24:53.860 --> 25:02.820]  air humidity, temperature changing. Here's the reason that absolute humidity is such
[25:02.820 --> 25:12.340]  a big deal. If I asked, we put a dish rag outside, would that dish
[25:12.340 --> 25:22.660]  rag dry faster at 30 degrees C and 80% humidity or at 5 degrees C and 20%
[25:22.660 --> 25:29.580]  humidity? Most people would say, well 20% humidity of course it's going to dry
[25:29.620 --> 25:42.580]  faster. Let's take a look. 5 degrees C, 20% there's our delta humidity. 30 degrees C,
[25:42.580 --> 25:53.140]  20% we're off chart. 80% we're over here. It's a bigger gradient for
[25:53.140 --> 25:58.980]  drying at a warm temperature at 80% humidity than it is down here at a low
[25:59.100 --> 26:04.700]  humidity and cold temperatures. This is real counterintuitive because you got to
[26:04.700 --> 26:07.780]  think of the combination of air temperature and humidity when we do
[26:07.780 --> 26:14.540]  absolute humidity. These principles, psychometric principles, have been
[26:14.540 --> 26:23.580]  around for 100 years and this charts been around for a long time. I worry
[26:23.580 --> 26:28.700]  that we're losing some of the intuitive insights you can get from this chart.
[26:29.020 --> 26:36.820]  Once you have it and you see points on this you can see them. This is real
[26:36.820 --> 26:46.340]  simple but to reiterate what I just said, here's another handout that shows these
[26:46.340 --> 26:56.100]  points. Two handouts. This is just what I wrote on the board with some formal
[26:56.140 --> 27:03.140]  definitions of these things and then a little diagram showing them. When you
[27:03.140 --> 27:07.980]  get to teaching this to other people you can show them this page. Then to
[27:07.980 --> 27:18.580]  further make sure you have it, I did three worked out examples where you have
[27:18.580 --> 27:22.900]  a couple different inputs and you can calculate the other parameters.
[27:22.900 --> 27:26.260]  Sometimes you know one, sometimes you know another.
[27:26.260 --> 27:35.540]  How we measured this through the ages?
[27:35.540 --> 27:47.500]  Before we had computers and electronic sensors we had psychrometers.
[27:47.500 --> 27:55.180]  You still can buy these. It's a wet dry bulb psychrometer and it doesn't
[27:55.180 --> 28:01.140]  take electricity. It doesn't take a fast microprocessor. It is two thermometers,
[28:01.140 --> 28:10.300]  one with a wet shoelace over it and one with nothing. Nothing is dry bulb.
[28:10.300 --> 28:14.980]  That's where the word bulb comes from. It's the bulb of a thermometer, a
[28:14.980 --> 28:20.340]  mercury or alcohol thermometer. It just means air temperature and the wet bulb
[28:20.340 --> 28:25.660]  means one that has a wick. The difference in temperature. Now we get two
[28:25.660 --> 28:30.260]  numbers and from this instrument we can calculate everything. No computer, just
[28:30.260 --> 28:34.900]  one piece of paper and this and we get the temperature and
[28:34.900 --> 28:41.540]  humidity. There's one key thing about this. You can see it pulls apart. To get
[28:41.540 --> 28:46.180]  the accurate wet bulb temperature you have to have a fan blowing on it and
[28:46.180 --> 28:50.020]  fans take electricity and we don't really want that. We do this and these
[28:50.020 --> 28:54.740]  are called sling psychrometers. I used to see people with these in their
[28:54.740 --> 28:59.540]  back pocket just like the people that carry around slide rules and they would
[28:59.540 --> 29:04.300]  whip this thing around and it aspirated and now let's see what we got here. You can tell
[29:04.300 --> 29:11.260]  me the humidity of the room. See if I can read this. The 77, oh my this is in
[29:11.260 --> 29:27.780]  Fahrenheit, but 77 is 25 C. The dry bulb is 25 and the wet bulb is 59 which is 15
[29:27.780 --> 29:35.020]  Celsius. Find 25 and wet bulb of 15 and tell me the humidity of this room
[29:35.020 --> 29:48.300]  from your chart. We guessed 30. We'll see how close we are. 37. Again that's
[29:48.300 --> 29:56.540]  these two lines here intersecting and then the curve. Because this
[29:56.540 --> 30:04.460]  whole thing is nonlinear and because this is all in the days before computers
[30:04.940 --> 30:12.140]  this has a little slide rule on it, tick marks. You can line up the wet and dry
[30:12.140 --> 30:16.620]  bulb and it will tell you the humidity right on this in case you don't have a
[30:16.620 --> 30:21.740]  chart you just do this. These tick marks are nonlinear because the
[30:21.740 --> 30:27.500]  relationships are nonlinear. This is a self-contained instrument to do
[30:27.500 --> 30:33.660]  humidity. They come, boy you can get them big if you need precision work. When I
[30:33.660 --> 30:39.860]  was in beginning in graduate school there were no good electronic humidity
[30:39.860 --> 30:45.220]  sensors. We would take thermocouples and we put a shoelace on one and a fan. We
[30:45.220 --> 30:48.780]  got wet bulb and dry bulb and that's how we did humidity. That was a
[30:48.780 --> 30:52.900]  state-of-the-art measurement. Then the wet bulb would get dirty and you had to
[30:52.900 --> 31:00.180]  clean it and it was complicated. That's how we did humidity. Being a
[31:00.180 --> 31:06.300]  collector of old instruments I've collected instruments to do this over
[31:06.300 --> 31:11.700]  the years. Here's one of my beauties. Maybe I should put this in the case
[31:11.700 --> 31:21.540]  here downstairs. Big reservoir, a wet wick and a dry wick and a nonlinear slide
[31:21.540 --> 31:25.180]  rule to get humidity from the relationships. You can just slide the
[31:25.180 --> 31:29.500]  points around to get humidity if you don't have a computer handy to do it.
[31:29.500 --> 31:34.540]  Instructions on the back for the owner's manual for how to use that
[31:34.540 --> 31:40.540]  instrument. Then people got better and we had bimetallic strips for humidity and
[31:40.540 --> 31:45.340]  temperature. Here's one with humidity and temperature and the lines cross. This
[31:45.340 --> 31:49.260]  is a little tiny miniature psychometric chart with the needles are crossing and
[31:49.260 --> 31:55.020]  you can get absolute humidity just from this. There's a lot of clever things that
[31:55.020 --> 32:02.780]  people did in the days before we had computers. Now slide rules
[32:02.780 --> 32:08.220]  are a completely lost art but you can still buy a psychometric slide rule
[32:08.220 --> 32:14.220]  where you get wet and dry bulb and you put it in here and calculate the other
[32:14.220 --> 32:18.780]  humidity parameters and calculate relative humidity from wet and dry bulb.
[32:19.500 --> 32:26.540]  This is interesting because in the days before computers, that's a linear
[32:26.540 --> 32:32.380]  kind of long, you could get a circular slide rule. It's the same thing, line
[32:32.380 --> 32:36.100]  these two points up and line the tick mark to get humidity. This you could
[32:36.100 --> 32:41.420]  carry in your back pocket for checking humidity anywhere. These are all
[32:41.420 --> 32:45.820]  fascinating instruments based on the human ingenuity in the days before
[32:45.980 --> 32:55.620]  computers, how they dealt with nonlinear stuff like this chart. I think that's the
[32:55.620 --> 33:05.940]  end of my instrument demo on this. Now let's start putting numbers in this. Once
[33:05.940 --> 33:11.700]  we get this, let's see if we can put numbers in this to get this because if
[33:11.700 --> 33:17.340]  we can do this we don't have to get it by subtraction because we've shown with
[33:17.380 --> 33:22.860]  instruments we can do a pretty good job of measuring this. The key for this is
[33:22.860 --> 33:37.460]  this is leaf, absolute humidity, and air. To be accurate about this we need to
[33:37.460 --> 33:44.860]  know the leaf temperature. If you do air temperature 100% minus air you can
[33:44.860 --> 33:51.300]  have significant errors in this depending on the conditions. We do need
[33:51.300 --> 33:55.740]  to have leaf temperature in this but once we get this then we have a very
[33:55.740 --> 33:59.700]  accurate measurement of this driving gradient. Then the rest of it is getting
[33:59.700 --> 34:02.700]  the resistance.
[34:03.660 --> 34:24.860]  Let's see. I'm going to come back to this in a second here. Let me erase all of this
[34:24.860 --> 34:41.350]  because this by the way you can buy these specialized for really cold
[34:41.390 --> 34:45.750]  temperatures and then combustion engineers buy them for really hot
[34:45.750 --> 34:50.470]  temperatures for like smokestacks. They're way out here but this is the one
[34:50.470 --> 34:55.710]  for environmental engineers which we're dealing with environmental temperatures.
[34:55.710 --> 35:05.790]  This is a classic thing, a ratio of driving gradient and resistance and
[35:05.790 --> 35:09.710]  we've got to have the units line up in this thing if this is going to be a flux.
[35:10.270 --> 35:13.270]  Amount per unit area per unit time.
[35:13.910 --> 35:21.710]  This one has units grams per kilogram but it turns out every time you work
[35:21.710 --> 35:28.150]  this you also have to have a correction for air pressure because that changes
[35:28.150 --> 35:32.150]  the driving gradient.
[35:32.950 --> 35:46.470]  What we do, this is the last 20 years, is calculate a dimensionless driving
[35:46.470 --> 35:53.350]  gradient. We would like to get this in a dimensionless term that we
[35:53.350 --> 35:59.550]  can use to put the numbers in this. To do that we have
[36:02.150 --> 36:21.970]  this gradient right here expressed in water vapor pressure. The amount of
[36:21.970 --> 36:31.730]  water in the air creates a vapor pressure. We know that from PV, from
[36:32.330 --> 36:37.090]  beginning chemistry, if we know the number of molecules in the air it's
[36:37.090 --> 36:42.530]  directly proportional to those pressure of those molecules in the air. When
[36:42.530 --> 36:47.170]  you see people talking about humidity you do not hear them talking about
[36:47.170 --> 36:52.650]  there was grams per kilogram in the air. We talk about vapor pressure of the
[36:52.650 --> 37:00.730]  water in the air. This is a direct relationship between number of
[37:00.730 --> 37:06.810]  molecules or weight and the pressure. The pressure in SI units is
[37:06.810 --> 37:14.250]  kilopascals. What we would like to do is know the absolute humidity expressed
[37:14.250 --> 37:20.730]  with units of vapor pressure. That's why two things on this.
[37:20.730 --> 37:31.010]  I think we can see them here. Over here in addition to grams per kilogram, which
[37:31.010 --> 37:37.570]  is intuitive, is vapor pressure. That goes from zero and this charts three
[37:37.570 --> 37:43.930]  and a half, four, and this has units of kilopascals. A vapor pressure
[37:43.930 --> 37:50.490]  difference would be the top number minus the bottom number. That's the amount
[37:50.730 --> 38:00.730]  of water in the air expressed as a vapor pressure. With that we can take this
[38:00.730 --> 38:07.410]  curve right here, which is this same curve only all it has on here is vapor
[38:07.410 --> 38:12.570]  pressure. Now this thing goes up to 50 degrees. You can calculate
[38:12.570 --> 38:17.610]  it at some very hot temperatures, really nonlinear. Here's the equation to get
[38:17.610 --> 38:25.330]  this curve. We do this all in a computer. Here is a table of values. We can do
[38:25.330 --> 38:31.130]  it by hand, examples looking stuff up here. We'll convert our absolute
[38:31.130 --> 38:34.130]  humidity in grams per kilogram to vapor pressure.
[38:41.730 --> 38:45.770]  I'm going to estimate this. Well we don't even have to estimate. We can do it
[38:45.890 --> 38:56.890]  pretty fast. 25, 30 right here. I go across. I'm getting about one kilopascal.
[38:56.890 --> 39:04.290]  That's the vapor pressure in this room. Now we go up here 25 cross and I get
[39:04.290 --> 39:22.450]  3.1, 3.2, 3.2 minus 1. Now converting units we have 3.2 minus 1 and now the
[39:22.450 --> 39:27.210]  units are kilopascals. I didn't teach this right in the beginning because a
[39:27.210 --> 39:34.210]  vapor pressure is not intuitive. A weight per volume is intuitive but this converts
[39:34.210 --> 39:40.930]  to pascals. Here's the beauty of this. Water vapor pressure, our delta H in our
[39:40.930 --> 39:57.570]  example, is 2.2 kilopascals. Now we would like to get a dimensionless ratio that
[39:57.570 --> 40:06.210]  we can use at all elevations and all pressures. Same thing. We ratio the
[40:06.210 --> 40:12.770]  pressure of the water in the air to the total air pressure. We divide it by the
[40:12.770 --> 40:33.700]  total air pressure. At our elevation, our average air pressure is 2.2 divided by 86 kPa.
[40:33.700 --> 40:40.420]  This varies a little bit. High pressure and low pressure might go from 85 to 87.
[40:40.420 --> 40:46.220]  It doesn't vary very much. Top of Mount Logan I think it might be 60 kPa. It varies a
[40:46.220 --> 40:50.820]  lot with elevation, but high and low pressure fronts don't change it very
[40:50.820 --> 40:56.380]  much. Somebody's going to have to do this math for me, but it's what is it
[40:56.380 --> 41:01.060]  going to be maybe 2.2 divided by 86.
[41:01.060 --> 41:15.460]  0.0256. Now this doesn't have units. This is a dimensionless ratio.
[41:15.460 --> 41:25.460]  kPa to kPa. That's the driving gradient for photosynthesis regardless of
[41:25.460 --> 41:31.020]  elevation because we've divided out by temperature. If we get the same gradient
[41:31.540 --> 41:37.380]  there's an important point for living at elevation. What if we took these
[41:37.380 --> 41:42.980]  measurements and we made them right out there at the top of Mount Logan and we
[41:42.980 --> 41:52.780]  got 2.2 kPa. We did all our careful measurements and now we're at 60 kPa.
[41:52.780 --> 41:55.780]  What's that come out to be?
[41:59.380 --> 42:11.310]  Which place has faster transpiration rates? Here everything's the same.
[42:11.310 --> 42:17.110]  Right here 0.025, 0.036. Transpiration is going to be
[42:17.110 --> 42:23.830]  significantly faster at the top of Mount Logan than it is here in Logan for the
[42:23.950 --> 42:29.350]  exact same conditions. If we do this at sea level it goes the other direction.
[42:29.350 --> 42:38.790]  2.2 and now sea level is 101 kPa average. This is by 0.022.
[42:38.790 --> 42:45.190]  Transpiration is less at sea level than here. This makes sense because
[42:45.190 --> 42:51.390]  water boils at lower temperatures as you get a higher elevation.
[42:51.590 --> 42:59.070]  Transpiration goes faster at lower pressures too. This is our dimensionless
[42:59.070 --> 43:06.830]  driving gradient. Now the units for resistance are going to be the same as
[43:06.830 --> 43:12.950]  the one over the units for flux. When we express this now in all the
[43:12.950 --> 43:18.590]  models we don't use resistance anymore even though I teach it that way because
[43:18.670 --> 43:31.150]  it's a nice ratio. We use conductance which in electric terms it's just one
[43:31.150 --> 43:36.790]  over the resistance. The equations you see for driving gradient for
[43:36.790 --> 43:45.990]  transpiration are transpiration equals delta H, it is a dimensionless ratio,
[43:45.990 --> 43:56.430]  times G sub S. The lowercase g stands for stomatal conductance and the S is
[43:56.430 --> 44:03.350]  stomatal. If this is dimensionless the units for conductance are exactly the
[44:03.350 --> 44:10.910]  same as the units for transpiration. This might be grams per meter squared
[44:10.910 --> 44:18.590]  per second and this is just dimensionless times in this case grams
[44:18.590 --> 44:29.350]  per meter per second, a unit for conductance. We'll talk about
[44:29.510 --> 44:35.030]  conductance in a minute. The key here is calculating this dimensionless number
[44:35.030 --> 44:43.670]  for transpiration. I can give you a worked out handout of this but I
[44:43.670 --> 44:48.910]  have a handout of typical values of these which helps because obviously if
[44:48.910 --> 44:55.710]  this ratio goes up 10% and the stomates don't change, transpiration goes up 10%.
[44:55.710 --> 45:01.230]  This we can measure with instruments. This is real hard to measure.
[45:01.230 --> 45:08.550]  At least we get this and we can start to estimate transpiration
[45:08.550 --> 45:14.150]  because all it is is two numbers multiplied together.
[45:14.150 --> 45:18.990]  Here's the whole thing in saturation vapor pressure and if
[45:18.990 --> 45:24.550]  you know this curve and you know humidity and temperature you don't have
[45:24.550 --> 45:28.990]  to do all these lines. This leads to an equation to do it in a computer in a
[45:28.990 --> 45:34.350]  spreadsheet. Our data loggers are pre-programmed to do all this stuff in
[45:34.350 --> 45:39.310]  them based on the endpoints because of these relationships. That's why we
[45:39.310 --> 45:48.950]  can do it all from that saturation vapor pressure curve. I have this table
[45:48.950 --> 46:02.700]  here of typical values flux, driving gradient, conductance. I could line this
[46:02.700 --> 46:15.240]  up here better. HI inside the leaf, HA air, stomatal conductance. Here's some
[46:15.240 --> 46:22.800]  typical transpiration rates. Transpiration is determined not by the
[46:22.800 --> 46:29.440]  weight of the water but by the number of molecules. We go with moles of water
[46:29.440 --> 46:35.440]  vapor rather than grams or milligrams. These are typical rates for a
[46:35.440 --> 46:40.200]  typical well-watered leaf in three different units and then a range for
[46:40.200 --> 46:46.960]  those units. Driving gradients, we got two and this is typical and we
[46:46.960 --> 46:55.800]  calculated 0.0256. There's our typical gradient and there's a range. If
[46:55.800 --> 47:01.520]  this was zero it would mean 100% humidity. This gradient can get
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.760]  enormous sometimes, really hot dry air. Here's typical units for
[47:06.760 --> 47:13.680]  stomatal conductance on the bottom. So far this whole thing is great.
[47:13.680 --> 47:19.440]  Even if we can nail this number we can't get transpiration until we have a sense
[47:19.440 --> 47:25.160]  of this. You can do two things. You can put in some typical values for this and
[47:25.160 --> 47:32.560]  calculate this, which is okay. This by the way is all for a single leaf. It's not
[47:32.560 --> 47:38.120]  for a community of leaves. It's exactly the same principles, but the
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.760]  driving gradient is the average for all the leaves in the community. They might
[47:42.760 --> 47:49.960]  be at different temperatures, but we average those temperatures. This GS
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.760]  is typically for a single leaf, but we can also calculate conductance for
[47:54.760 --> 48:00.920]  multiple layers of leaves too. That's the difference for a canopy. This doesn't
[48:00.920 --> 48:10.960]  change, but this one does. Let me say a bit about stomatal conductance. This
[48:10.960 --> 48:18.440]  gets a bit more squishy and I need some room to show this.
[48:19.040 --> 48:37.010]  I'll put this right here. Here's our stomates. A couple of basic principles. Here's G sub S
[48:37.010 --> 48:49.610]  for stomates. Let's put zero here for closed, completely closed. If we're
[48:49.610 --> 48:59.970]  going off of typical numbers, this can almost get to one. When it's one, the
[48:59.970 --> 49:03.210]  units are moles per meter squared per second.
[49:03.210 --> 49:13.530]  Moles of water vapor per meter squared per second. This unit does not have any
[49:13.530 --> 49:17.690]  physical meaning. It's just a number to make the units cancel in this whole
[49:17.770 --> 49:29.130]  thing, but the driving gradient does. If this is absolute humidity, what
[49:29.130 --> 49:35.210]  happens to stomates? Now we're going to go from zero.
[49:35.210 --> 49:42.370]  Zero would be no air at all in the air.
[49:42.370 --> 49:54.860]  I'm just going to put dry. Humid and dry air. That's good
[49:54.860 --> 49:59.580]  enough for the principle. Stomatal conductance, what does this look like?
[49:59.580 --> 50:05.140]  Well, the driving gradient changes a lot, but do the stomates change as it gets
[50:05.140 --> 50:15.660]  more humid? It turns out they do. As air gets more dry, stomates close. Now if I
[50:15.660 --> 50:19.860]  have zero here, that probably is about right. I mean if it's super dry.
[50:19.860 --> 50:26.020]  Stomates are not constant. This is why this is so complicated, because even if
[50:26.020 --> 50:30.660]  we get this driving gradient right, the stomates keep changing because
[50:30.900 --> 50:38.900]  they're responding to humidity. After decades of research, and part of it's by
[50:38.900 --> 50:42.820]  Keith Mott, my colleague at the University, that's his whole research is
[50:42.820 --> 50:49.860]  understanding what affects these stomates. If it's dry air, I'm going to erase my
[50:49.860 --> 50:58.140]  numbers here, these stomates dry up and they shrink and they effectively
[50:58.140 --> 51:05.300]  get farther. Nope, sorry, the other way around. If it's dry air, they protect the
[51:05.300 --> 51:11.980]  inside and they start to close so that to keep this humid in here. This has to
[51:11.980 --> 51:17.820]  be humid so the plant can grow, otherwise it desiccates and it dies. Now the
[51:17.820 --> 51:26.060]  humidity gets higher and they open up more because there's not such a
[51:26.060 --> 51:33.260]  gradient. It's easier to keep this holding. We do not understand exactly
[51:33.260 --> 51:39.100]  what these stomates perceive in here, but humidity is a big deal and they open and
[51:39.100 --> 51:46.060]  close to keep the leaf hydrated. One of the classic things you see is, this is
[51:46.060 --> 51:52.420]  summer, lots of people are growing zucchini and squash. It's common to see a
[51:52.420 --> 51:58.420]  squash plant around here in the middle of the day wilt. If you see them in your
[51:58.420 --> 52:03.540]  garden, if you've ever done that, and you go, dang it, my squash just melted and you
[52:03.540 --> 52:09.820]  watered again, it still wilts. That process is called physiological drought
[52:09.820 --> 52:17.060]  and it means that the squash keeps its stomates so open, the xylem can't keep up.
[52:17.060 --> 52:20.900]  It can't get water to the leaves fast enough and it wilts in the middle of the
[52:20.900 --> 52:27.700]  day. When it wilts, then these close and then it gets more water and
[52:27.700 --> 52:33.300]  they open, but squash overdoes it, doesn't close its stomates fast enough to
[52:33.300 --> 52:39.940]  stay hydrated. Most plants are very carefully regulating this. There's a
[52:39.940 --> 52:45.860]  basic relationship between humidity and this is really this delta, this I should
[52:45.860 --> 52:54.820]  really say driving gradient here, and stomates. Stomates close at night. Great.
[52:54.820 --> 53:02.260]  It conserves water. They need to get CO2 in for photosynthesis, but there's
[53:02.260 --> 53:11.100]  no photosynthesis at night, they close. We also know, if we did, let's see if I can
[53:11.100 --> 53:20.700]  draw another, if we also did CO2 concentration on this same graph and
[53:20.700 --> 53:34.820]  stomatal conductance. Now this is CO2 inside the leaf. This is high
[53:34.820 --> 53:44.940]  CO2 and this is low CO2. As the CO2 gets low, the stomates open to let more in and
[53:44.940 --> 53:51.300]  if you give them more CO2, they start to close. We know this from when we
[53:51.300 --> 53:56.820]  enrich plants with CO2, they grow faster and the stomates close. Why would they
[53:56.820 --> 54:02.020]  lose water? They've got plenty of CO2, they start to close their stomates.
[54:02.020 --> 54:11.220]  CO2 affects this as well. This mostly is determined by photosynthesis. If the
[54:11.220 --> 54:17.980]  photosynthesis gets faster because of that CO2, then it drives it over here and
[54:17.980 --> 54:22.740]  you've got to have open stomates to get fast photosynthesis. It's like breathing
[54:22.740 --> 54:29.620]  to get the CO2 in. At night photosynthesis stops and they close
[54:29.620 --> 54:35.420]  their stomates. In the day, the higher the sun, they're trying to get the stomates
[54:35.420 --> 54:41.580]  open to get more CO2 so they can grow faster as long as they can keep up with
[54:41.580 --> 54:48.140]  the water coming to the top of the plant. In a nutshell, and I'm going to
[54:48.140 --> 54:54.140]  close here, this is why direct measurements of transpiration are so
[54:54.260 --> 55:00.260]  difficult. Even though we can get driving gradient, we've always got to be
[55:00.260 --> 55:08.020]  estimating this resistance. These estimates are... you can make nice
[55:08.020 --> 55:11.580]  measurements in the lab. How do you measure resistance for stomates? Years
[55:11.580 --> 55:16.180]  ago we used to take microscopes and look at the size of the stomates. Oh, they're
[55:16.180 --> 55:21.540]  more open here, measure that one. We don't do that anymore. How do we do it now? We
[55:21.540 --> 55:29.260]  measure this and then we measure this and we calculate that. That's the
[55:29.260 --> 55:34.500]  remaining thing. We've done this thousands of times, rearranged this
[55:34.500 --> 55:39.140]  equation to get resistance and then we start to make drive principles like this
[55:39.140 --> 55:44.220]  for what the stomates do. After we get those principles, what environmental
[55:44.220 --> 55:48.340]  conditions affect the stomates, then we take them to the field and try and
[55:48.340 --> 55:54.820]  predict whole canopies from it. It's difficult to do. The beauty of it is
[55:54.820 --> 55:59.140]  driving gradients are not difficult and we know they're related to those and
[55:59.140 --> 56:06.940]  those we can measure and calculate based on psychometric principles.
[56:06.940 --> 56:09.460]  Any questions?
[56:10.180 --> 56:18.580]  This is the end of the transpiration part of this. If I could find an outline
[56:18.580 --> 56:29.700]  here. I just blew through this whole works right here in transpiration.
[56:29.700 --> 56:36.380]  Tomorrow, lecture 6, we'll talk about conduction and convection, which is
[56:36.380 --> 56:40.540]  the same fluxes driving gradient over resistance. That goes pretty fast
[56:40.540 --> 56:48.140]  because it's the same equation. Now we can really nail this because
[56:48.140 --> 56:55.260]  guess what? The resistance here does not involve biology. It just involves
[56:55.260 --> 57:00.820]  wind blowing and cooling things and those are physical principles. Here we
[57:00.820 --> 57:06.180]  can nail heat transfer by conduction and convection because there's no
[57:06.980 --> 57:12.660]  squishy biology of the stomates opening and closing. Now we can get this and
[57:12.660 --> 57:19.780]  then again by subtraction we can get transpiration. We'll see you tomorrow
[57:19.780 --> 57:21.380]  at one o'clock.
