[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  series. I want to get some closure Ryan today on this topic of energy balance.
[00:07.840 --> 00:14.280]  There's one little tidbit I want to point out before I get into the
[00:14.280 --> 00:21.080]  Earth's energy balance. This is a graph. Remember how we said the radiation can
[00:21.080 --> 00:26.040]  go above a thousand because of reflection from clouds and that causes
[00:26.040 --> 00:31.440]  all kinds of people to panic about things. This happens to be some data
[00:31.440 --> 00:36.480]  from the campus environmental observatory for last January, but it was
[00:36.480 --> 00:46.760]  a series of days that were partly cloudy. So there's a black line on here that is
[00:46.760 --> 00:53.720]  the calculated radiation for a clear sky. Now this is winter so note it only goes
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.840]  to about 450 watts per meter squared, but that's the value for the winter. So
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.000]  here's three different replicate radiometers in here and this was partly
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.960]  cloudy, this is partly cloudy, this was very cloudy, then look at this day right
[01:10.960 --> 01:17.240]  here. The clouds acted like a lens like we talked about and even though the
[01:17.240 --> 01:24.640]  clear sky was about 450 we had readings of 650 on the instrument. That wasn't bad
[01:24.640 --> 01:30.520]  instruments, it was reflection of light by clouds. So sometimes these can go way
[01:30.520 --> 01:38.240]  above clear sky by radiation focusing on them. We calculate net and shortwave
[01:38.240 --> 01:45.400]  on here in addition, but the main point here was to show this. It has been
[01:45.520 --> 01:52.320]  very useful for us to calculate a clear sky radiation. So you can tell here's a
[01:52.320 --> 01:58.400]  day when it was clear sky and the instruments are close to the model. They
[01:58.400 --> 02:06.080]  came up with the sky, came down with the sky. So because the clear sky model is so
[02:06.080 --> 02:12.800]  useful, there's a website that shows this. I can show it on the
[02:12.800 --> 02:21.200]  magnet. Here's the magnet right here. Many of you have this magnet.
[02:21.200 --> 02:30.080]  Boy, they're really bonded together. This is the third and final
[02:30.080 --> 02:39.200]  magnet that we're going to talk about. This is at clearskycalculator.com.
[02:39.200 --> 02:45.280]  For any time of day, any point in the world, this calculates the clear
[02:45.280 --> 02:51.800]  sky. It's particularly accurate at solar noon and you can use it to tell if
[02:51.800 --> 02:58.720]  your instruments need to be recalibrated. All of our tests with this indicate
[02:58.720 --> 03:07.160]  in the summer at solar noon this is within two percent of the true value.
[03:07.160 --> 03:11.520]  The coefficients you put in here include humidity and temperature because of
[03:11.520 --> 03:17.320]  atmospheric attenuation, elevation, latitude, of course time of year.
[03:17.320 --> 03:21.280]  Calculate radiation anywhere in the world. That's just a little tidbit that's
[03:21.280 --> 03:28.200]  been really useful to help people make better measurements for radiation.
[03:28.200 --> 03:33.840]  It's fairly widely used. I think it could be used a lot more widely for people to
[03:33.840 --> 03:41.800]  make better measurements. Now this is the outline for today where we hope to
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.760]  get to. Radiation balance of the earth. I think it's real interesting as soon as
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.800]  we get these numbers we can figure out radiation for a leaf. How's this look if
[03:51.800 --> 04:03.520]  we do the whole planet? This is the, I guess I need to zoom in or out.
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.560]  There it is, the whole planet. There's many diagrams like this, but this is one
[04:08.560 --> 04:15.760]  of my favorites. I stopped into Paul Campbell's office a year ago and he had
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.880]  this on the wall of his office. I gave it to him and he loved it so we
[04:19.880 --> 04:26.080]  put it on his wall. Here's all the incoming solar energy to the earth.
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.560]  Six percent, boom, right off the bat reflected by the atmosphere right back
[04:30.600 --> 04:37.000]  into space. Clouds, this is a variable. If there's more clouds, more reflection, but
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.880]  some clouds. Then finally, earth's surface, pretty small reflection.
[04:43.880 --> 04:52.560]  Absorbed by the atmosphere a tiny bit, but then finally here's the absorbed by
[04:52.560 --> 04:58.120]  land and oceans. Then this warms up and it re-radiates into space as long
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.040]  wave radiation. It's coming in as short wave and it's going out as long wave.
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.240]  I love these colors because the burner on a stove glows red and that's long
[05:07.240 --> 05:17.080]  wave radiation. All of these are small numbers, but you can see how this is a
[05:17.080 --> 05:26.840]  delicate balance if this radiation balance changes. For all the apparent
[05:27.080 --> 05:34.320]  controversy about global warming, we know CO2 absorbs long wave radiation. We know
[05:34.320 --> 05:41.360]  CO2 is going up. We can mathematically calculate the absorption of CO2, of
[05:41.360 --> 05:48.960]  radiation, by CO2 in the air and calculate the heating caused by that.
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.440]  You could say, how could this be controversial? These are known physical
[05:53.440 --> 06:00.480]  principles. As we say, the absorption of long wave radiation by CO2 is
[06:00.480 --> 06:08.200]  unassailable. We know exactly how it changes this cooling by long wave
[06:08.200 --> 06:12.200]  radiation. Here's the amazing thing about this.
[06:12.800 --> 06:16.160]  Remember we had, well you could see them on here.
[06:16.720 --> 06:22.320]  Now there's not numbers on here, but this is a thousand watts in the middle of the
[06:22.400 --> 06:25.400]  day coming in. These are big numbers.
[06:25.960 --> 06:33.200]  Here's a paper by a whole bunch of authors. One of the key authors is James
[06:33.200 --> 06:39.160]  Hansen, who was quite famous in circles. He's testified before Congress
[06:39.160 --> 06:42.800]  many times on this. Look at how many offers they put in these papers.
[06:42.800 --> 06:49.840]  Look at this. Our climate model driven by human-made greenhouse gases,
[06:50.400 --> 06:59.080]  aerosols, calculates the earth is now absorbing 0.85 watts per meter squared
[06:59.080 --> 07:02.280]  more energy than the Sun than it's emitting to space.
[07:03.040 --> 07:09.280]  Less than one watt is the energy imbalance of the earth.
[07:09.800 --> 07:16.640]  Now he puts a plus a minus, 0.15. Those are some serious models.
[07:16.640 --> 07:20.320]  You're not saying, oh this is less than 5%. We'll throw that out. All that stuff
[07:20.320 --> 07:25.960]  matters. Even though these are known physical principles, the energy
[07:25.960 --> 07:31.600]  imbalance is small, but it's enough to cause the temperature to rise.
[07:32.280 --> 07:37.920]  I think the only controversy about global warming is what's the effect of
[07:37.920 --> 07:39.280]  rising temperature?
[07:39.280 --> 07:44.720]  Yes, it's rising, and yes it's caused by CO2, and yes the CO2 is caused by people.
[07:45.240 --> 07:51.000]  So, can Canadians have a t-shirt that says I'm in favor of global warming?
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.760]  So some people, it's not a bad thing to them. And then people say, well look, it's
[07:55.760 --> 07:59.520]  going to melt the ice caps, raise the ocean, Miami will be flooded.
[08:00.080 --> 08:05.200]  So they can move. There's the controversy.
[08:05.200 --> 08:10.680]  It's not what's happening, it's how serious is the problem. And that's where
[08:10.680 --> 08:17.480]  we get into erratic weather. If all that happened was a slow steady increase in
[08:17.480 --> 08:24.400]  temperature, a few tenths of a degree per decade, we can deal with that. But if the
[08:24.400 --> 08:30.200]  weather goes chaotic, now we got a big problem. And there's the cutting edge of
[08:30.200 --> 08:36.840]  climate science research. Will global warming cause erratic weather? And
[08:36.840 --> 08:43.920]  there's lots of evidence that it does, but people disagree about how much
[08:43.920 --> 08:49.280]  erratic weather might happen. If it changes rainfall patterns, that's a big
[08:49.280 --> 08:55.520]  deal. That can change agriculture, it could it can cause a lot of famine for a
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.880]  lot of people just by shifts in rainfall patterns. So to me, that's the cutting
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.200]  edge of climate change research. Not whether it's happening, but what are the
[09:06.560 --> 09:12.320]  long-term consequences going to be. But when I read this paper, it was some years
[09:12.320 --> 09:16.680]  ago, but I just about fell out of my chair as I think of the fluxes of
[09:16.680 --> 09:25.400]  these numbers. So I want to go into this a tiny bit more. Several years ago,
[09:25.400 --> 09:34.360]  let's zoom out on this, NASA got ready to launch a satellite called Glory. And this
[09:34.440 --> 09:39.840]  is a brochure on Glory, understanding the Earth's energy budget. Now NASA has lots
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.840]  of satellites doing this already, but this one had specialized instruments to
[09:43.840 --> 09:50.040]  get some of the lesser-known parameters to measure more accurately. And we were
[09:50.040 --> 09:55.720]  all so excited about this satellite. It took years of work and had really
[09:55.720 --> 10:02.080]  expensive instruments. It blew up on launch. And now we're trying to get
[10:02.080 --> 10:14.000]  money again to launch another version of it. But in this brochure was a two-page
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.120]  analysis of the Earth's energy budget that I thought was the best short
[10:21.120 --> 10:32.640]  summary I had ever read of this. So I'm sharing it with you. I have two
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.800]  handouts. One is the one I just showed, which shows percentages of all
[10:37.800 --> 10:42.400]  these arrows. And now you have a sense of what those arrows all look like on a
[10:42.400 --> 10:48.640]  single leaf. Apply the same principles to the whole planet. This one shows absolute
[10:48.680 --> 10:57.320]  numbers on this. I might be able to focus this a tiny bit better. This one shows
[10:57.320 --> 11:02.680]  absolute numbers. You can't see them here, but they're on this handout. And what's
[11:02.680 --> 11:07.240]  reflected and absorbed. And of course these numbers change as the Earth
[11:07.240 --> 11:11.960]  rotates. We're not always measuring it right pointed at the Sun. There's
[11:11.960 --> 11:17.240]  nighttime in there and we're on the edges. But in a nutshell this shows
[11:17.360 --> 11:23.400]  these. Here's another reason, another thing that helps you understand some of
[11:23.400 --> 11:31.520]  the controversy in this. Here's what's called radiative forcings, which
[11:31.520 --> 11:36.600]  is just another name for what's causing this. I want to zoom in on this just
[11:36.600 --> 11:42.400]  a little bit. Radiative forcing components. Now this is becoming more and
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.560]  more common for people to express their data like this. But if you haven't seen
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.800]  this before, and people debate the size of the error bars on these, but it also
[11:52.800 --> 11:57.760]  helps you understand the controversy of a global warming. So if that bar goes up
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.280]  that means it's a factor causing the earth to get warmer. If it goes down it's
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.080]  a factor causing earth to get colder. So if there's things on here that reflected
[12:08.080 --> 12:14.360]  radiation the earth would cool. And if they absorb it gets warmer. Here's CO2.
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.760]  The biggest bar in this graph in the end over here is the net of everything.
[12:19.760 --> 12:26.320]  Here's CO2. That error bar is the difference among the models of what CO2
[12:26.320 --> 12:33.400]  is doing. And they're not all the same. And this is watts per meter squared. So
[12:33.400 --> 12:39.280]  1.5, 1.6 watts per meter squared plus or minus 0.1 or 0.2. That's not very
[12:39.360 --> 12:47.320]  controversial. We understand this. Methane, nitrogen oxide gases, and
[12:47.320 --> 12:54.240]  halocarbons are real powerful absorbers of long-wave radiation. So just traces of
[12:54.240 --> 13:00.040]  these have a big effect. And cumulatively these add about another watt per meter
[13:00.040 --> 13:06.000]  squared. These have been going into the atmosphere before they were people, but
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.840]  human activities have increased these other gases as well. There's a lot of
[13:10.840 --> 13:16.400]  work on methane and nitrogen oxides and other things now in addition to just CO2.
[13:16.400 --> 13:23.920]  So then we go into ozone. And there's tiny elements of cooling and heating.
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.920]  This is a much smaller bar, but a bigger error bar on that. Stratospheric water
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.840]  vapor. Tiny changes in atmospheric water. Water absorbs long-wave radiation.
[13:36.200 --> 13:43.160]  If the humidity changes, it drives warming, but not very much. Then albedo. If we
[13:43.160 --> 13:46.160]  painted the earth white, we'd cool it off.
[13:46.720 --> 13:54.080]  Well, land-use changes can mean that more radiation gets reflected into space. If we
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.240]  have big forests, they absorb a lot of radiation. We cut them down. We just have
[13:58.240 --> 14:03.240]  bare ground. We reflect more radiation into space. So there's bigger error bars
[14:03.280 --> 14:10.280]  here, but it's plus and minus. Now we get to aerosols. Tiny droplets of things
[14:10.280 --> 14:14.200]  in the air. If we had a microscope we could see them, but they're
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.040]  droplets of liquids in the air.
[14:18.600 --> 14:25.720]  They reflect radiation. And look at the size of these error bars. Cloud albedo
[14:25.720 --> 14:32.400]  effect. Those clouds that are causing us complications in our model, if it's
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.480]  cloudy all the time the earth is going to cool. That's one of the huge
[14:36.480 --> 14:40.440]  variables in here is what the clouds do. Look at the size of that error bar.
[14:40.440 --> 14:47.200]  Clouds are aerosols after all. They're in this category. Then a couple
[14:47.200 --> 14:51.920]  other tiny factors. Changes in solar radiation. People say the Sun is just
[14:51.920 --> 14:53.800]  putting out more energy.
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.360]  Well, yes it is. There it is. It's above zero and with a pretty big error bar.
[14:59.480 --> 15:05.640]  This is not a big effect. We would like to say it's all this. Party on. Don't
[15:05.640 --> 15:09.400]  worry. These things are minor compared to the Sun, but the data doesn't support
[15:09.400 --> 15:18.400]  that hypothesis. Here's the net effect. Now this model shows about 1.6 watts
[15:18.400 --> 15:24.280]  per meter squared. The paper I just showed had 0.85 watts per meter
[15:24.280 --> 15:30.680]  squared. You can see where the different models vary a little, but there are no
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.160]  models that say this is zero. There are no models that say it's a negative
[15:35.160 --> 15:40.720]  number. They just vary in the magnitude of the warming. This helps explain
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.440]  why it's controversial because some things make it cooler, some things make
[15:44.440 --> 15:52.280]  it warmer. For years we've worked with NASA on long-term space missions growing
[15:52.280 --> 15:57.560]  food for people in space. One of the issues is terraforming Mars. Can't we
[15:57.560 --> 16:00.560]  just start making Mars more of a nicer planet?
[16:01.080 --> 16:06.560]  Well, yeah, but it's cold. Well, we'll just fly some stuff up there that turns it
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.840]  black and makes a planet darker. Then you run the numbers and yeah that
[16:11.840 --> 16:17.240]  works. You can make Mars a darker color, get the absorption up, it'll start to
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.160]  warm up. It'll melt the water into ice and pretty soon we start to create an
[16:21.240 --> 16:26.480]  atmosphere up there. They're literally as smart people saying let's get Mars
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.920]  darker so we can, might take 50-100 years, but let's get it darker so we can go
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.160]  and live there. This is the application of energy balance principles
[16:37.160 --> 16:44.240]  to whole planets, not just our own. The whole universe has to follow the first law of
[16:44.240 --> 16:48.760]  thermodynamics. As far as we know we haven't discovered a universe that doesn't
[16:48.760 --> 16:56.040]  have to follow that. We take those principles to other places. With all the
[16:56.040 --> 17:03.480]  conversation and debate about global warming, I think it's useful for people
[17:03.480 --> 17:07.800]  to be a bit more educated, particularly when you get the principles of short
[17:07.800 --> 17:12.600]  wave and long wave radiation. Now you can take those and apply them to lots of
[17:12.600 --> 17:22.860]  places. I'm not sure where NASA is on another satellite, but a big part
[17:22.860 --> 17:31.540]  of that one was to do aerosols. This is following up now in my order of my
[17:31.540 --> 17:43.650]  organization on a few little things that we didn't get into. Remember when
[17:43.930 --> 17:59.970]  radiation absorbed equals radiation in times 1 minus albedo. This is all fine.
[17:59.970 --> 18:13.330]  Then we said for a typical leaf the albedo is 1 minus 0.5. However,
[18:13.330 --> 18:20.490]  here's short wave radiation again, short and long. Here's the short wave, here's the
[18:20.490 --> 18:30.770]  long wave, LS over here. Long wave is really pretty consistent. It doesn't
[18:30.770 --> 18:36.290]  matter what wavelength it is for long wave as far as absorption of materials.
[18:36.290 --> 18:41.370]  It matters a lot for transmission through the atmosphere, but when we talk about
[18:41.650 --> 18:51.610]  long wave radiation, a number that's at 8,000 would behave similarly to 50,000.
[18:51.610 --> 18:57.250]  It's all those wavelengths are the same. This is not true for short wave
[18:57.250 --> 19:04.730]  radiation. The wavelengths matter a lot for short wave. When we say 50%
[19:05.090 --> 19:12.290]  albedo or 25% when people talk about albedo, they are talking about an average
[19:12.290 --> 19:21.170]  of all the wavelengths. Remember this is about 280 nanometers to 3,000. This
[19:21.170 --> 19:26.050]  whole thing is in units of nanometers. Lots of times you see this in micrometers.
[19:26.210 --> 19:29.210]  These wavelengths matter a lot.
[19:36.250 --> 19:55.880]  In the textbook for right here, figure 7.4, this shows for a typical
[19:56.040 --> 20:02.280]  leaf what's absorbed, what's reflected, and what's transmitted. Of course this is
[20:02.280 --> 20:11.920]  very far from a flat line. You can see that 50% is an average, so that's okay.
[20:11.920 --> 20:21.920]  We can use 50%, but here's photosynthetic radiation micrometers 0.4 to 0.7
[20:22.040 --> 20:29.360]  almost all absorbed. Remember this is 40% of the total, almost all absorbed of
[20:29.360 --> 20:34.280]  this. This is what causes photosynthesis, so it's a good thing it's absorbed. Then
[20:34.280 --> 20:41.160]  we get to 700 and the chlorophyll molecule does not absorb light past
[20:41.160 --> 20:46.720]  700. It's just heat. I'm going to say that plants are pretty smart.
[20:47.040 --> 20:53.040]  They let that thermal radiation go right through or they reflect it. This
[20:53.040 --> 21:01.720]  radiation is like 10% absorbed. This near-infrared radiation. If we draw it
[21:01.720 --> 21:17.720]  on our graph right here, we have UV, we have 400 and 700. This is 95% absorbed.
[21:17.720 --> 21:26.600]  This radiation in here, then suddenly it gets just past that and this
[21:26.600 --> 21:34.800]  part about out here is maybe 10% absorbed. It depends on the exact
[21:34.800 --> 21:40.760]  wavelength. You can see this bounces around out here a little. It's a
[21:40.760 --> 21:45.000]  little misleading. It simplifies the model a great deal to say we just have
[21:45.000 --> 21:52.920]  one number for albedo. But since we're dealing with plants and not just
[21:52.920 --> 21:59.480]  parking lots and other surfaces, it's important to know that these vary a lot.
[21:59.480 --> 22:08.920]  That's the diagram in the book. Lots of people diagram the same thing in
[22:08.920 --> 22:15.200]  different ways. Here's a diagram from another book. I like this a little
[22:15.200 --> 22:20.880]  better because it's not on a log scale. You can see it better. Now it has
[22:21.040 --> 22:27.480]  absorption here. Photosynthetically active radiation 400 to 700 nanometers.
[22:27.480 --> 22:33.760]  This is green light. A little bit more green light bounces off and a little bit
[22:33.760 --> 22:40.200]  more is transmitted. But boom! Right at 700 nanometers the reflection and
[22:40.200 --> 22:47.680]  transmission go up and they're real low until we get out here to 1.4, 1.5 and
[22:47.680 --> 22:53.360]  then they become absorbed more. But the amount of radiation is going down like
[22:53.360 --> 22:58.520]  this. These are huge amounts here and after we get out here there's just much
[22:58.520 --> 23:04.320]  less radiation. This shows differential absorption by the leaf of those
[23:04.320 --> 23:12.800]  components. I could tell you were worried about this because this is the
[23:12.800 --> 23:16.360]  handout from the other day. Let me back off so you see the whole thing here.
[23:16.360 --> 23:25.120]  This is the handout that talked about typical values for albedo and emissivity
[23:25.120 --> 23:31.760]  of these. Then if you kept reading for being in advance you're itchy to ask me
[23:31.760 --> 23:38.160]  what's going on with these numbers down here. I got to fold this to show it.
[23:38.160 --> 23:43.680]  On the bottom of this is what happens to this radiation.
[23:49.200 --> 23:57.920]  These are typical numbers on the bottom of this and it segues into longwave too.
[23:57.920 --> 24:05.440]  Photosynthetic, now on here I put 90% absorbed and over here I put 90%
[24:05.440 --> 24:13.200]  it's high. It depends on how thick the leaf is, whether it's 90 or 95.
[24:13.200 --> 24:19.640]  Roughly equal amounts of reflection and transmission to 100%.
[24:19.640 --> 24:27.120]  There's photosynthetic. We draw our line and it switches to mostly
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.320]  reflection and transmission. This is a big reason leaves can stay cool.
[24:31.720 --> 24:35.720]  They're not having to absorb that thermal radiation. It's of no value to
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.760]  them unless they're cold and they want to try and get warmer. They got plenty
[24:39.760 --> 24:46.600]  of light to keep them warm. Then we go in this to longwave radiation.
[24:46.600 --> 24:57.800]  4000 to 100,000 micrometers and this should say nanometers right here.
[24:57.800 --> 25:09.640]  These are all nanometers. 96% absorbed of longwave and we had emissivity and
[25:09.640 --> 25:13.000]  absorptivity of 0.96.
[25:13.000 --> 25:22.320]  What happens to the other 0.04 if it's not absorbed by the leaf?
[25:22.320 --> 25:28.840]  The answer is it's reflected. There was a tiny bit of longwave radiation that gets
[25:28.840 --> 25:41.320]  reflected by surfaces. Tinfoil reflects 97% of longwave radiation. For thermal
[25:41.320 --> 25:48.360]  radiation tinfoil is just like a mirror. If we put a piece of tinfoil right
[25:48.360 --> 25:54.040]  here and I put an infrared gun on it, it wouldn't tell us anything about the
[25:54.040 --> 25:57.560]  temperature of the tinfoil. It would tell us the temperature of the people in the
[25:57.560 --> 26:04.360]  class because it's reflecting all the people in here. This is a tiny number,
[26:04.360 --> 26:12.680]  but when we get into rigorous analysis of energy balance this 4% matters.
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.880]  In a field it's just reflected back into space, but depending on the situation it
[26:17.880 --> 26:20.880]  can get reabsorbed somewhere.
[26:26.880 --> 26:32.880]  What does it do with the 4%? If it's reflected, nothing.
[26:32.880 --> 26:42.400]  This 96% becomes heat. It's thermal radiation and it makes the object get
[26:42.400 --> 26:54.040]  hotter until it reaches a new equilibrium. It's converted to heat.
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.040]  It can't utilize it.
[26:58.040 --> 27:05.800]  As we said the other day, this is a big reason leaves are warm, but of
[27:05.800 --> 27:10.920]  course the good news is they can also by radiation get rid of it too.
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.320]  It's highly absorbed, but not completely 100%.
[27:15.320 --> 27:22.240]  This little example here about emissivity and absorption of
[27:22.240 --> 27:35.640]  reflection leads to the use of some instruments to measure radiation.
[27:35.640 --> 27:40.840]  The place that I have found that's the most interesting about this is in
[27:40.840 --> 27:50.640]  buildings. All buildings built in the last 10 to 15 years have low e glass.
[27:50.640 --> 27:54.560]  If you ever dealt with the building you've heard of low e glass, if you heard
[27:54.560 --> 27:55.560]  of that Boston.
[27:55.560 --> 28:01.640]  So what's low e glass? It's all the rage. Oh yes, we're putting low e glass.
[28:01.640 --> 28:08.240]  That is low emissivity glass. The glass looks like tinfoil for long wave
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.320]  radiation. Now exactly the physics of how they're doing that I'm a little fuzzy on
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.880]  because we could certainly put tinfoil up and it would be very effective.
[28:17.880 --> 28:20.520]  This glass right here, this is a new building.
[28:20.520 --> 28:27.720]  This has low e glass. I've never tested it. Here is, let's do some research
[28:27.720 --> 28:33.240]  right now about the emissivity of the glass. Here's a little cheap infrared
[28:33.240 --> 28:41.120]  gun. We have several around here. I've bought lots of these and you can
[28:41.120 --> 28:46.800]  get these things for under $25. It gives you the surface temperature in
[28:46.800 --> 28:54.360]  either Celsius or Fahrenheit. They're remarkably accurate for what
[28:54.360 --> 29:00.200]  they cost. Let's see if I can get this in Celsius so we understand the
[29:00.200 --> 29:06.240]  number. Let's do a test right here. I'm getting, and I can't see this, I'm
[29:06.240 --> 29:13.560]  getting 32 Celsius for this glass and that's probably the temperature of the
[29:13.560 --> 29:16.560]  ceiling up here in this room.
[29:16.560 --> 29:24.080]  Although the glass is pretty warm because the sun is shining on it, 3% of the
[29:24.280 --> 29:29.120]  signal. If this was that low, this is probably not the same as tinfoil.
[29:29.120 --> 29:35.840]  The emissivity might be, let's say it's 10%. The temperature I'm measuring is 10%
[29:35.840 --> 29:41.160]  of the true surface temperature and 90% of the ceiling. It's warmer than
[29:41.160 --> 29:47.240]  the ceiling, but it's certainly not the temperature of that glass.
[29:47.240 --> 29:52.080]  Most of the things in here are, I don't know if this is low e
[29:52.080 --> 29:57.160]  glass because it's not an exterior wall, but if we did it on this, you can see
[29:57.160 --> 30:05.800]  this has a little red LED so you can tell where you're pointing. If that
[30:05.800 --> 30:10.320]  was cold and this was warm, it would reflect and tell us the
[30:10.320 --> 30:11.360]  temperature in here.
[30:11.360 --> 30:22.160]  That's the concept of low e. Let me try and attempt to take this one step
[30:22.160 --> 30:26.640]  farther. One thing I know for sure, as soon as anybody learns the principles of
[30:26.640 --> 30:30.400]  these stuff, they want to own a lot of instruments to measure it because then
[30:30.400 --> 30:39.840]  they understand what's going on. This is a thermal imaging camera. These
[30:39.840 --> 30:45.360]  things are 25 bucks and the more accurate ones cost a few hundred
[30:45.360 --> 30:50.560]  dollars. This thermal imaging camera, these have come down fast and
[30:50.560 --> 30:56.320]  thousand bucks, something like that for this. I mean they used to be a lot more
[30:56.320 --> 31:01.760]  than that. Now let's see if we can point, I don't know if the camera can get
[31:01.760 --> 31:10.040]  this, but we point at this window and it's telling us the glass is warmer than
[31:10.040 --> 31:16.240]  the wall, but mostly the glass is reflecting the long wave off the wall.
[31:16.240 --> 31:39.040]  These are really useful for refined
[31:39.040 --> 31:44.920]  measurements of different temperatures. The absolute accuracy of these is
[31:44.920 --> 31:50.360]  not the greatest, but the relative accuracy is really impressive. You can
[31:50.360 --> 31:59.040]  see tiny changes in temperature. If I get out of the way, we can start to see the
[31:59.040 --> 32:07.320]  windows in this, the boards much cooler. I could pass this around and you can
[32:07.320 --> 32:12.600]  look through it a bit. I just charged it up so hopefully it's got
[32:12.600 --> 32:18.720]  enough charge to last for a little bit. If you spend a few minutes with
[32:18.720 --> 32:23.160]  this pointing it at things, it really drives home the principles of long wave
[32:23.160 --> 32:30.840]  radiation and the value of using long wave emissivity to get temperature of
[32:30.840 --> 32:40.480]  things. I have one more demonstration of low-e glass. I went down to Bennett's
[32:40.520 --> 32:46.080]  Glass and I said don't you guys have a demo of this that helps people
[32:46.080 --> 32:51.280]  understand low-e? They got all excited and they said yeah yeah yeah we can
[32:51.280 --> 33:01.920]  order one. This is for people selling low-e glass. This side right here is
[33:01.920 --> 33:12.360]  ordinary glass and this side over here is low-e glass. Like I said, 15 years
[33:12.360 --> 33:18.160]  ago there was just only primitive low-e glass. Now I think it's almost code. I
[33:18.160 --> 33:22.480]  think everyone has to use low-e because it keeps the heat in. You're not going to
[33:22.480 --> 33:27.360]  lose heat by radiation and it works both ways. The cold radiation outside, it
[33:27.360 --> 33:32.480]  doesn't radiate inside anymore. The cold is reflected on the outside. Now
[33:32.480 --> 33:41.720]  let's start our experiment. I've got a light and these little radiometers spin in
[33:41.720 --> 33:49.400]  proportion to how much radiation is hitting them. You can see that the
[33:49.400 --> 33:56.000]  ordinary glass is making this spin more than the low-e glass.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.360]  There's the principle of low-e. These are real cool. You put them in the
[34:03.360 --> 34:13.000]  window and they spin like crazy. This is for people that really just want to see
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.800]  a demo. They don't understand the physics, they just want to see a demo and the
[34:17.800 --> 34:26.800]  ordinary glass makes that spin more. Thank you. How would you calibrate one of
[34:26.800 --> 34:34.720]  these? You can take, this is called a Leslie cube, but it's a cube full of
[34:34.720 --> 34:42.520]  water, and a cone inside painted as black as we can get it. Special flat black paint
[34:42.680 --> 34:48.880]  so that emissivity gets very 0.99 something for the emissivity. If it's a
[34:48.880 --> 34:53.560]  cone shaped the long wave bounces back and forth sideways so the emissivity
[34:53.560 --> 34:59.760]  gets even higher because it's a cone shape. My assistant has filled this with
[34:59.760 --> 35:04.960]  hot water and now we can put this right here.
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.720]  What are we saying? I think it holds it.
[35:13.560 --> 35:23.760]  Now I want to get close. Let's see if we can. What are we getting there?
[35:23.760 --> 35:38.400]  51. Now let's go over here. What do we get there? It's emissivity. This is a
[35:38.400 --> 35:43.480]  silver side, it's not emitting the heat. I touch it and it feels hot and
[35:43.480 --> 35:48.040]  they're exactly the same temperature, but because this is such higher
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.000]  emissivity it gives us a bigger number. You can use these in an instrument. You
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.760]  can use these to determine the field of view because all these
[35:58.760 --> 36:03.280]  instruments have a cone shaped field of view. You would like to think that
[36:03.280 --> 36:08.960]  this little red dot, I'm only getting that red dot, but it's in fact averaging
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.600]  this one's probably averaging a two or three meter squared area up there
[36:12.600 --> 36:17.480]  because it's low cost. If you want to get just the red dot you got to pay more for
[36:17.480 --> 36:27.360]  a more precise instrument. You can take these and if I do this and it's got a
[36:27.360 --> 36:30.920]  high temperature and I start to move it back away quite quickly it'll start to
[36:30.920 --> 36:35.960]  see the edges and it's no longer measuring just that black cone because
[36:35.960 --> 36:41.560]  it's averaging the cone plus this. Some of the higher quality
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.280]  instruments you can go far away and it will still just see the cone. That's one
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.080]  of the reasons you pay more for higher-end instruments and you can buy
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.840]  cheap ones like this. Plus these work pretty good if the temperatures are all
[36:53.840 --> 36:58.480]  within five degrees C of the instrument, but if you try to measure a hot surface
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.840]  with this they're just not very accurate. That's another problem with
[37:02.840 --> 37:07.320]  radiometers is they always measure the Delta T because there's always an
[37:07.320 --> 37:11.400]  exchange of radiation between the instrument and the surface and it
[37:11.400 --> 37:16.320]  says this is my temperature that surface is five degrees warmer so it
[37:16.320 --> 37:26.920]  adds the two numbers together. This is emissivity on principles of it.
[37:26.920 --> 37:34.320]  Fortunately glass helps you to see this. We could do all kinds of things
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.880]  with tinfoil in here too, showing how it reflects the radiation like a mirror.
[37:39.880 --> 37:49.600]  It shows the power and the importance of the emissivity. Two simple
[37:49.600 --> 38:02.520]  equations or laws that relate to radiation that are important. One is
[38:02.520 --> 38:12.440]  Wien's law. This is pronounced Wien's. This is a German guy. Many years ago he's
[38:12.440 --> 38:20.000]  looking at the relationship between long wave and short wave radiation and he
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.160]  says as objects get hotter they radiate at shorter wavelengths because this is
[38:27.160 --> 38:32.400]  showing us a dichotomy of short and long. But wait a minute isn't there stuff here
[38:32.520 --> 38:44.080]  in the middle? Yes there could be. Wien's law says, let's erase this,
[38:44.080 --> 38:58.230]  the maximum wavelength and in this case this would be this point right here
[38:58.230 --> 39:06.270]  maximum equals, no I'm going to be simpler, it's proportional to one over
[39:06.270 --> 39:15.950]  temperature. Real simple. Inversely proportional to temperature. So as the
[39:15.950 --> 39:20.510]  temperature of an object gets hotter it radiates at shorter and shorter
[39:20.950 --> 39:28.990]  wavelengths. This is low temperature objects out here. This is the Sun right
[39:28.990 --> 39:38.950]  here and the peak number from the Sun is 550 nanometers or micrometers.
[39:38.950 --> 39:41.910]  You could look at the yellow magnet that's pretty close to that
[39:42.030 --> 39:57.110]  peak wavelength. Now let's put some numbers in this and solve it.
[39:57.110 --> 40:03.430]  After we get this the concept here, now if we do equal sign, first of all
[40:03.430 --> 40:09.230]  this is temperature in Kelvin not in Celsius and this is the maximum
[40:09.710 --> 40:21.790]  wavelength in micrometers. Now we have units but it's not one over this. This is
[40:21.790 --> 40:34.150]  a constant and this constant is 2897. There's the entire Wien's law. Roughly
[40:34.150 --> 40:40.550]  3000 divided by the temperature in Kelvin of the object will give us the
[40:40.550 --> 40:51.590]  peak wavelength. So if the Sun is radiating at 0.5 micrometers, now we're
[40:51.590 --> 40:59.070]  going to do some math to make this simple, 0.5 micrometers, how hot is the
[40:59.070 --> 41:07.630]  Sun? Well we rearrange Wien's law temperature in Kelvin and I'm going to
[41:07.630 --> 41:18.070]  put some we're going to round that to 300 and this is 0.5 micrometers rounding.
[41:18.710 --> 41:26.670]  The Sun is 6000 Kelvin rounding to make the math easy and that's pretty hot.
[41:26.670 --> 41:31.310]  We don't have anything on the earth that's that hot which is why this
[41:31.310 --> 41:39.590]  shortwave is coming from the Sun because it has to be that hot. What if we put
[41:39.590 --> 41:54.790]  about the inside of an oven. We're going to bake the turkey. Let's take
[41:54.790 --> 42:01.750]  this off and now we're going to say maximum wavelength 3000. Now we're going
[42:01.750 --> 42:07.710]  to put temperature in here and you bake a turkey it's 400 degrees or a pizza at
[42:07.710 --> 42:18.870]  400 degrees that's roughly 200 Kelvin. The inside of an oven might be 273 plus
[42:18.870 --> 42:24.710]  a couple hundred 500 Kelvin to make this math easy.
[42:24.710 --> 42:41.990]  Now I got a mistake in here somewhere. This is coming out to six micrometers.
[42:41.990 --> 42:52.590]  Yeah no it's not a mistake. So this is 0.5 and a hot oven is out here at these
[42:52.710 --> 43:05.310]  nanometers so this is 8 micrometers so a hot oven is over here 6 micrometers.
[43:05.310 --> 43:10.310]  This is why terrestrial objects all radiate out in here depending on their
[43:10.310 --> 43:14.910]  temperature and even a hot oven doesn't get us to shortwave radiation it's still
[43:14.910 --> 43:22.110]  longwave. These are all described by Wien's law and there's another
[43:22.190 --> 43:36.890]  application of this. Here is a graph of doing this for a couple of temperatures.
[43:36.890 --> 43:48.450]  Here's 5500 Kelvin and as this gets cooler it shifts out here to longer
[43:48.450 --> 43:53.970]  wavelengths. Not by much but it shifts so you see two things happening.
[43:54.010 --> 43:58.530]  Remember Stefan-Boltzmann equation? The total radiation is determined by the
[43:58.530 --> 44:03.730]  temperature and as the temperature gets cooler the area under this curve gets
[44:03.730 --> 44:13.050]  less and as it gets hotter it becomes more blue. The hotter the
[44:13.050 --> 44:20.530]  object the more blue, the cooler the object the more orange and red. So we use
[44:20.530 --> 44:27.090]  Wien's law, 0.1% of the people in the world know this, to determine color
[44:27.090 --> 44:35.210]  temperatures of lights and all kinds of things. We say in film this is a 4000
[44:35.210 --> 44:41.530]  Kelvin film and this light has some Kelvin temperature. None of them are
[44:41.530 --> 44:47.650]  smooth curves it's just an effective way to say the color temperature of objects.
[44:47.650 --> 44:51.730]  We talk about color temperature but it's from Wien's law. The bigger the
[44:51.730 --> 44:56.890]  number the more blue the output. Blue lights have you could say a cool white
[44:56.890 --> 45:02.610]  fluorescent which is blue, this might be a 6000 Kelvin light and a warm white
[45:02.610 --> 45:08.170]  fluorescent which is more orange might be a 3000 Kelvin light. That all
[45:08.170 --> 45:16.290]  comes from Wien's law and this shift from the maximum wavelength. When you
[45:16.290 --> 45:19.970]  see those color temperatures and you think through this and anytime it's
[45:19.970 --> 45:26.490]  inversely proportional you have to shift your thinking a little. Hot objects are
[45:26.490 --> 45:36.570]  more blue. Planck's equation. I don't have my picture of Planck here but he's one of
[45:36.570 --> 45:43.370]  the top 25 scientists of all time. This picture he has a tie on and little
[45:43.370 --> 45:48.490]  tiny glasses and he just makes it look like he was a very organized guy and he
[45:48.490 --> 45:53.610]  was. He lived to be 82 years old which is a real accomplishment in the
[45:53.610 --> 46:07.530]  1800s when he lived. We have this refrigerator magnet which everybody's
[46:07.530 --> 46:21.090]  got on their filing cabinet now. We're showing this both in photons and energy
[46:21.090 --> 46:28.690]  and the shape of the curve. The photon flux is all the physiologists that
[46:28.690 --> 46:33.490]  are modeling and predicting photosynthesis and the energy flux is
[46:33.850 --> 46:38.730]  all the meteorologists that are modeling temperature and the differences in
[46:38.730 --> 46:43.290]  temperature. They're obviously both important and they're different shapes.
[46:43.290 --> 46:51.850]  Is there any way to go back and forth between joules, this is per meter
[46:51.850 --> 46:56.210]  squared per second per nanometer, this is meter squared per second nanometer. Is there any
[46:56.210 --> 47:02.410]  way to go back and forth between joules and moles of photons? The answer is
[47:02.530 --> 47:10.530]  thanks to Max Planck.
[47:10.530 --> 47:18.690]  Thanks to Max Planck. I'm going to erase some of this to give Planck lots of room for his
[47:18.690 --> 47:38.550]  for his equation. Another very simple equation. Energy per photon is
[47:38.550 --> 47:47.830]  proportional to 1 over the wavelength. Real similar to this only this is
[47:47.830 --> 47:55.150]  temperature and quality of the light. This is allowing us to go
[47:55.150 --> 48:04.750]  back and forth between joules or watts of energy and photons. Energy drives
[48:04.750 --> 48:10.990]  thermal reactions and photons drive a whole other set of reactions like
[48:10.990 --> 48:17.990]  photosynthesis. We know that one photon excites one electron. That's
[48:17.990 --> 48:24.070]  called the Stark-Einstein law and that's what causes photosynthesis. That is
[48:24.070 --> 48:29.950]  exactly what causes electricity in a solar photovoltaic cell. One photon
[48:29.950 --> 48:35.390]  excites one electron and we get electricity. Those solar voltaic cells
[48:35.390 --> 48:39.390]  aren't running off of thermal radiation. They need shortwave radiation and we
[48:39.510 --> 48:45.150]  need to count photons to determine electricity. We get Planck's equation
[48:45.150 --> 48:56.630]  inversely proportional to wavelength. Now if we change this to equals, this one
[48:56.630 --> 49:08.550]  becomes H and C. C is the speed of light. H is Planck's constant. I don't
[49:08.550 --> 49:15.990]  have these two numbers memorized but they're big numbers. This is
[49:15.990 --> 49:25.630]  joules per photon here. If we put numbers in this, and this is how I remember it
[49:25.630 --> 49:30.430]  because it's like a lot of things, you work it out for one value and then you
[49:30.430 --> 49:42.310]  can forever ratio things to that value. If we do HC over 550 nanometers,
[49:42.310 --> 49:50.230]  now this is right in the middle between 400 and 700. 550 is the average wavelength
[49:50.230 --> 49:55.390]  of light from the Sun. It's green light, it's average light. Right in the middle
[49:55.510 --> 50:10.370]  this comes out to be 217 kilojoules per mole of photons. Putting these numbers in.
[50:10.370 --> 50:15.890]  I'll work out a page with the step-by-step math worked out on this and
[50:15.890 --> 50:22.210]  all the numbers in it. There's a relationship. Now if you say what
[50:22.210 --> 50:28.250]  would the energy, what would this number be at 600? Well you can easily ratio this
[50:28.250 --> 50:38.370]  and you get this relationship here. Planck's equation allows us to go
[50:38.370 --> 50:44.690]  back and forth between energy and moles. You can keep going with this
[50:44.690 --> 50:51.690]  equation like we have here to 800, 900, 1000. Here's the photon flux. These
[50:51.810 --> 50:57.930]  photons are longer, associated with longer wavelength. They have less energy.
[50:57.930 --> 51:05.330]  I like to think of the UV photons are really high energy. If this was
[51:05.330 --> 51:13.890]  315 nanometers, this thing would be, let me see, if we took half of this, 275, this
[51:13.890 --> 51:18.850]  would be over 400 kilojoules per mole. That's ultraviolet light.
[51:18.890 --> 51:24.130]  That's high energy photons, which is why ultraviolet photons are so degrading to
[51:24.130 --> 51:27.490]  everything. They're super high energy. They're just, I don't know, they're like
[51:27.490 --> 51:32.690]  third graders. They just got a lot of energy. Then you get out here to 900 and
[51:32.690 --> 51:36.690]  it's the people with canes and there's low energy. There's still one person but
[51:36.690 --> 51:45.250]  they're low energy. These photons past 700 no longer have enough energy to
[51:45.250 --> 51:53.050]  excite electrons for photosynthesis, so we don't count them. Down here they're
[51:53.050 --> 51:57.410]  too high of energy for photosynthesis. They're damaging. There's not that
[51:57.410 --> 52:04.530]  much down here either, so it's got to be just in this right range. It leads
[52:04.530 --> 52:12.970]  to the shapes of these curves. Incidentally, solar photovoltaics are in
[52:13.050 --> 52:20.530]  the laboratory similar efficiency to photosynthesis. In a good solar voltetics,
[52:20.530 --> 52:26.050]  now you get up 30-40 percent efficiency. Photosynthesis can be 30-40
[52:26.050 --> 52:30.930]  percent too in the lab. They're both going off of one photon excites one
[52:30.930 --> 52:38.410]  electron. One makes carbohydrates and the other one makes electricity. Solar panels
[52:38.410 --> 52:44.410]  can use these photons. They keep absorbing out to a thousand, even
[52:44.410 --> 52:50.130]  eleven hundred out here. So solar panels can use some of this longer wave
[52:50.130 --> 52:55.890]  radiation. Photosynthesis can't. It's generally why solar photovoltaics are
[52:55.890 --> 52:58.890]  more efficient than photosynthesis.
[53:09.410 --> 53:16.970]  Yes, so the question is how come plants are green? If there's so much green light
[53:16.970 --> 53:25.650]  wouldn't they want to capture that? Two answers. One, this is a
[53:25.650 --> 53:33.850]  fairly flat curve, so it's not that much different green light. Still, why
[53:33.850 --> 53:38.010]  don't they absorb everything? Why do they have a dip at all in green light?
[53:38.010 --> 53:43.490]  If they could capture that green light too, they'd be more efficient.
[53:43.490 --> 53:48.370]  You could say, well chlorophyll just doesn't absorb green light, that
[53:48.370 --> 53:52.730]  molecule. Well then it's a bad molecule. They should have got something else.
[53:52.730 --> 54:02.040]  The way I like to think of it is animals came along and they eat plants.
[54:02.040 --> 54:07.600]  Our eyes can see green light better than any other wavelength. If we drew our
[54:07.600 --> 54:10.600]  eyes on here, I can put it on here.
[54:10.600 --> 54:18.040]  Green, put it on here, and black, blue. Here's our eyes. This is a little thing.
[54:18.040 --> 54:24.040]  Our eyes look like that. We see green really well. We don't see blues and reds
[54:24.040 --> 54:30.840]  very well. So animals evolved to be able to see plants. Plants reflected the
[54:30.840 --> 54:37.120]  green light and the animals that could see that green light found the
[54:37.120 --> 54:42.200]  plants better and got more food. I never heard anyone else say that, but
[54:42.200 --> 54:47.120]  that's a good sounding hypothesis. It's interesting that wavelengths of light
[54:47.120 --> 54:54.600]  reflected by plants are the ones that we see the best. You could also
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.520]  ask, couldn't we invent a better molecule for plants that captured all
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.720]  this? Now we know there's lots of pigments in plants besides chlorophyll.
[55:04.720 --> 55:09.280]  If you look at older plant physiology textbooks, they say, well plants don't
[55:09.280 --> 55:15.960]  absorb much green light. Look at chlorophyll. In fact, let me answer that.
[55:15.960 --> 55:24.160]  Let's see. Let's put this right here. We got this done with this. Here's our 400 to
[55:24.160 --> 55:35.600]  700 blown up big. If you look at a plant physiology textbook, chlorophyll looks
[55:35.600 --> 55:41.240]  like that. It absorbs blues. There's chlorophyll A and B, but they look
[55:41.240 --> 55:46.720]  like this. They absorb blues and reds, but the chlorophyll hardly absorbs any green.
[55:46.720 --> 55:52.440]  All the plant physiology textbooks said, well chlorophyll doesn't absorb
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.200]  much green. Guess what? When we invented efficient LEDs that were blues and reds,
[55:57.200 --> 56:02.840]  a whole bunch of people went, wow these are perfect for plants because they
[56:02.840 --> 56:06.240]  match the absorption of chlorophyll. There still are no
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.200]  efficient green LEDs. We have them, but they're not efficient at
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.720]  all. They said the LEDs are perfect for plants. They match the absorption of
[56:15.720 --> 56:21.000]  chlorophyll. Then we found out they really don't work very well through 10-20
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.160]  years of work. How come? Well now we know, and if you take a modern plant
[56:27.160 --> 56:33.240]  physiology textbook, they have curves in here like this and like this, and they're
[56:33.240 --> 56:38.760]  all colors. I'm out of colors, but you get the idea. There's a whole bunch
[56:38.760 --> 56:43.800]  of curves in those now, and they say multiple pigments absorb all the light.
[56:43.800 --> 56:50.680]  There's a new pigment, psychorethrin, is discovered in algae. I don't
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.280]  know about discovered. It was clarified in algae just a few years ago. It's peak
[56:55.280 --> 57:00.760]  absorptions in green light. There's the potential to genetically engineer to
[57:00.760 --> 57:03.840]  put more psychorethrin in plants, and then they will get that green light.
[57:03.840 --> 57:09.640]  They won't look green anymore, I guess. They'll look black.
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.280]  This is a long answer to an interesting question. How come they don't
[57:13.280 --> 57:19.480]  get pigments to capture every speck of it? What I would like to see is pigments
[57:19.600 --> 57:24.600]  so they could use some of this. There's a lot of energy right in here, and if we
[57:24.600 --> 57:30.640]  could just get pigments to get up to 800, wow, we could feed the world.
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.560]  We don't have them. Chlorophyll ends at 700 and then nothing. Yes, they would
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.280]  absorb more heat too, but will precision irrigate and save water and get more
[57:41.280 --> 57:48.920]  yield. Why do pigments do what they do? How do they evolve?
[57:48.920 --> 58:03.250]  They're interesting questions. So the question is, is the limiting factor
[58:03.250 --> 58:17.090]  absorbing radiation for yield? Yes, it is a limiting factor.
[58:17.090 --> 58:22.690]  When you plant in the spring, you got beautiful light. It's May and early
[58:22.690 --> 58:27.410]  June. There's a lot of light. 90% of it's wasted as it hits the ground.
[58:27.410 --> 58:32.970]  Here's the little nice green plants, but 90% is wasted. Finally, they fill in
[58:33.170 --> 58:39.490]  and yield takes off. There's an example of absorbed radiation. What we're
[58:39.490 --> 58:46.570]  talking about here is after it fills in, couldn't we get it? Here's one
[58:46.570 --> 58:51.250]  answer to the question, kind of a smart-ass answer. What do you mean? They
[58:51.250 --> 58:56.410]  already absorbed 95% and you're complaining? Couldn't we get this to 98%?
[58:56.410 --> 59:09.850]  That would be a 3% and every little bit helps. I'm going to stop here and
[59:09.850 --> 59:19.370]  we'll take a break. This is the end of radiation lectures. When we come back in
[59:19.370 --> 59:27.530]  a few minutes, we will talk about transpiration. All of this is we're
[59:27.530 --> 59:30.530]  going to get transpiration by subtraction.
[59:30.530 --> 59:38.570]  Can't we just measure it directly? The answer is sort of. Let's take a
[59:38.570 --> 59:39.410]  break.
