[00:00.570 --> 00:09.410]  Welcome to lecture 6 in this series. Now we are up to conduction and
[00:09.410 --> 00:17.890]  convection, the final component of this energy balance analysis. Because
[00:17.890 --> 00:26.730]  this follows the same principles as transpiration, it
[00:26.730 --> 00:31.690]  takes less time to explain these principles because it's also flux is the
[00:31.690 --> 00:37.370]  driving gradient divided by the resistance, that ratio. Remember in the
[00:37.370 --> 00:43.650]  case of the psychometric chart we spent a lot of time talking about how to
[00:43.650 --> 00:50.410]  calculate the driving gradient, the leaf to air vapor pressure difference. That
[00:50.410 --> 00:56.970]  requires some calculations. In the case of conduction and convection, however,
[00:56.970 --> 01:03.410]  this is real simple because the numerator is just the delta T, the delta
[01:03.410 --> 01:09.570]  temperature between the object and the air. If you know air temperature
[01:09.570 --> 01:14.650]  and you know the surface temperature, both of which we measure, we know the
[01:14.650 --> 01:23.330]  numerator for sensible heat. In a minute I'm going to talk about how we
[01:23.330 --> 01:30.330]  calculate the resistance. Now this is much more complex in conduction and
[01:30.330 --> 01:34.370]  convection. It's complex in transpiration too because this is
[01:34.370 --> 01:40.450]  stomatal opening, a biological phenomena. But here it's physical
[01:40.450 --> 01:45.370]  phenomena that determine that. So let me take a tiny sidebar before I talk about
[01:45.370 --> 01:52.210]  that. We've pulled up here the Environmental Observatory on the Utah
[01:52.210 --> 01:58.210]  State University campus, and here's a live camera showing it. If we watch
[01:58.210 --> 02:04.690]  this long enough some student will walk through the picture right here. This has
[02:04.690 --> 02:10.010]  a whole series of graphs that demonstrate all of these principles. It's
[02:10.070 --> 02:15.530]  got net radiometers, long wave, we talked about this in a previous lecture.
[02:15.530 --> 02:20.890]  Here's the current past two days of temperature. There's some people
[02:20.890 --> 02:29.010]  coming by. What's fascinating around here is this blue line is campus. The
[02:29.010 --> 02:36.530]  red line is where we're at right now, which is the middle of the valley.
[02:36.530 --> 02:42.770]  The red line is Airport CSI. If we tell people Campbell Scientific, not
[02:42.770 --> 02:46.650]  everyone in the valley knows where Campbell Scientific is. So we put
[02:46.650 --> 02:52.770]  airport slash CSI, but the data from CSI is far superior to the airport data. So
[02:52.770 --> 02:57.410]  we don't actually use the airport data, we use the CSI data, but we tell them
[02:57.410 --> 03:04.090]  it's the airport. That's why it says airport CSI. But this night, like so many
[03:04.170 --> 03:07.930]  other nights around here, is just everything. Our weather, because of our
[03:07.930 --> 03:12.130]  changes in elevation in our valley, are just fascinating. Here's the green line
[03:12.130 --> 03:16.850]  which is the top of Logan Peak. Anyone can walk outside and see this
[03:16.850 --> 03:22.450]  weather station up there. We're in July. It's finally getting warmer on Logan
[03:22.450 --> 03:28.730]  Peak. But look at the difference between campus and Campbell Scientific. We're
[03:28.730 --> 03:35.410]  at maybe four degrees C colder in the middle of the valley last night. And look
[03:35.410 --> 03:43.010]  at this night. Last night we got to nine degrees C here at Apogee and Campbell
[03:43.010 --> 03:51.570]  Scientific, which are right together. And campus only got to 16. There
[03:51.570 --> 03:57.490]  was a nine degree Celsius difference in temperature last night, which is an
[03:57.530 --> 04:03.570]  inversion. And it was colder here. An inversion would trap the air and
[04:03.570 --> 04:08.450]  potentially we'd have polluted air. But the sun came up and it warmed it right
[04:08.450 --> 04:13.730]  up and a few hours later the inversion went away. And this is the summer. In the
[04:13.730 --> 04:19.170]  winter, these red and blue lines get below the green line and stay there for
[04:19.170 --> 04:24.690]  days at a time. But this is a fascinating difference. And what happens up in the
[04:24.690 --> 04:29.290]  top of Mount Logan is it just never warms up. Here we warm up to 30 in the
[04:29.290 --> 04:34.330]  day and there they're barely warming up to 16 or 18 in the day. That's just the
[04:34.330 --> 04:41.730]  temperature. This shows wind speed, barometric pressure, and then solar
[04:41.730 --> 04:46.890]  radiation. These are nice clear days. You can see this is getting to a thousand. It
[04:46.890 --> 04:50.530]  looks like we looked out the window. I guess there ought to be a few clouds and
[04:50.530 --> 04:54.290]  there's a few clouds. If you have this you actually don't have to look out the
[04:54.290 --> 04:58.890]  window. You can just see what's going on outside by looking at the graph. Here,
[04:58.890 --> 05:04.410]  clouds. Now we're at 1116. There's some reflection off the clouds. We're going
[05:04.410 --> 05:10.010]  above our thousand watts per meter squared. This is where it's located on
[05:10.010 --> 05:16.050]  the campus. Let's look at a few of these because they demonstrate some of
[05:16.050 --> 05:22.850]  these principles so well. Dew point and humidity. There's the air temperature and
[05:22.930 --> 05:27.970]  dew point temperature. We have dry air so the dew point actually is below zero
[05:27.970 --> 05:34.290]  some of the time. Look at this. Absolute humidity, relative humidity. Absolute
[05:34.290 --> 05:39.570]  humidity has a few fluctuations but day and night it's generally a flat line at
[05:39.570 --> 05:45.890]  about five or six grams per cubic meter. Relative humidity down in the day, up at
[05:45.890 --> 05:52.210]  night down cycles because of air temperature. After you get these
[05:52.210 --> 05:56.970]  principles you just love seeing how they work and interpreting the data on this
[05:56.970 --> 06:03.450]  thing. All of these graphs have one day and then you can call up the past seven
[06:03.450 --> 06:09.490]  days. We're working on a new revision of this that's a lot more sophisticated.
[06:09.570 --> 06:17.210]  The whole campus is going to a better internet display that will
[06:17.210 --> 06:23.530]  automatically scale to fill people's screens much nicer. We talked about
[06:23.530 --> 06:30.290]  barometric pressure, how much that varies. Let's call that up. One day
[06:30.290 --> 06:35.730]  this is adjusted to sea level. Everybody adjusts to sea level so we can make maps
[06:35.930 --> 06:41.050]  of the pressures, highs and lows. Even though this is here it's corrected to sea
[06:41.050 --> 06:45.890]  level so the barometric pressure is going down. This is more interesting in seven days.
[06:45.890 --> 06:50.970]  These are electronic barometers so it goes up. We're at a real high pressure.
[06:50.970 --> 06:56.370]  Now we're going down for the past seven days as those fronts come through. One of
[06:56.370 --> 07:02.810]  the most interesting things about this station is carbon dioxide concentration.
[07:03.330 --> 07:06.690]  That's wind. There we go.
[07:07.250 --> 07:18.290]  Here's CO2 on campus. We're coming along here, low 400 ppm and a big spike here
[07:18.290 --> 07:23.450]  and another big spike here. Is that people breathing on this sensor? People
[07:23.450 --> 07:32.570]  driving their cars by the sensor? No. This is canyon winds. The canyon winds come
[07:32.570 --> 07:36.570]  out of the canyon and they have clean air right out of the Cache National
[07:36.570 --> 07:41.290]  Forest. All that photosynthesis cleans the air and look what happened here.
[07:41.290 --> 07:51.250]  9 p.m. the wind, this is, the wind shifted. Right here is canyon wind. 90
[07:51.250 --> 07:57.490]  degrees is coming out of the canyon. That canyon wind died about 730 this morning
[07:57.490 --> 08:04.050]  and it shifted and we got a puff of wind from downtown Logan and it spiked
[08:04.050 --> 08:10.050]  the CO2. We got another spike here and now finally it's all the valleys
[08:10.050 --> 08:15.730]  clearing out. We see this every day. The canyon wind is low CO2 because of
[08:15.730 --> 08:20.410]  photosynthesis in the summer and then the canyon wind dies and the valley air
[08:20.410 --> 08:28.050]  shifts up and we get a spike in CO2. Partly that's governed by photosynthesis.
[08:28.050 --> 08:33.450]  Here's the photosynthetic photon flux that drives that and then wind speed.
[08:33.450 --> 08:44.930]  Surface temperature. We talk about calculating surface temperature. Most
[08:44.930 --> 08:48.370]  people don't realize how different surface temperatures can be than air
[08:48.370 --> 08:53.850]  temperatures. We're talking about Delta T right here for driving conduction and
[08:53.850 --> 09:00.530]  convection. This is two replicate apogee infrared sensors in the red and green
[09:00.530 --> 09:11.010]  line pointing east and west. The ground surface, grass. Yes, this is
[09:11.010 --> 09:20.250]  irrigated turf. Let's jump back and we'll come back to this. It should call up
[09:20.250 --> 09:23.450]  here in a second and I can show you exactly what they're pointing at.
[09:23.450 --> 09:33.530]  Not coming up, but they're pointing at the irrigated turf. Surface
[09:33.530 --> 09:39.610]  temperature. Last night, and we're going to talk about this in a minute, way
[09:39.730 --> 09:45.170]  below air temperature. Several degrees C below air temperature. It was a clear
[09:45.170 --> 09:50.010]  night. They're radiating to outer space so they get cold. The sun comes up and
[09:50.010 --> 09:57.210]  suddenly they're warmer. Today we're only getting four degrees C above air
[09:57.210 --> 10:03.970]  temperature, but I have seen this go as high as 10 degrees C above air
[10:03.970 --> 10:09.650]  temperature. The turf grass surface compared to the air temperature. It
[10:09.650 --> 10:15.090]  tells you how big these surface temperature fluxes can be. This is
[10:15.090 --> 10:20.090]  irrigated too. It's lush and irrigated.
[10:23.970 --> 10:32.130]  One of the comparisons that we do up there is between shields. This is a graph
[10:32.290 --> 10:39.370]  of replicate matching tiny yellow bead thermistors. One of them is in a
[10:39.370 --> 10:45.210]  traditional gill shield and one of them is in an apogee aspirated shield. This
[10:45.210 --> 10:52.290]  is the last 24 hours. You can see at night they're virtually identical and
[10:52.290 --> 10:58.370]  there's no flux. Here's the temperature differences in the day. Yesterday,
[10:58.370 --> 11:02.330]  for a little bit, we had three degrees C difference, but most of the time it was
[11:02.330 --> 11:07.410]  down around to one degree C difference. This is a small sensor inside that
[11:07.410 --> 11:16.130]  shield so you can track that, see the differences. Net radiation, we already
[11:16.130 --> 11:21.090]  talked about this. This is all the principles and all the calculations. This
[11:21.090 --> 11:27.290]  is intermittent clouds going on right here. Here's albedo of that grass up
[11:27.330 --> 11:33.850]  there through the day. What did we say, 0.23 about for albedos. This is
[11:33.850 --> 11:38.410]  just a hair above two. It's slightly higher in the morning and it goes down
[11:38.410 --> 11:43.850]  slightly in the afternoon. Right now it's 0.21 albedo of that turfgrass.
[11:43.850 --> 11:49.730]  What else do you want to look at? One of the unique features of this is
[11:49.730 --> 11:54.970]  atmospheric visibility. This is a Campbell Scientific sensor. Most of the time it's
[11:54.970 --> 12:00.810]  very clear. A fleck of something got in there for these downward spikes.
[12:00.810 --> 12:06.010]  32 kilometers is the max. That's real clean air. This is something that we
[12:06.010 --> 12:11.170]  watch a lot in the winter when we have inversions. How low does the visibility
[12:11.170 --> 12:17.690]  go? I've seen this in the worst days of winter to go down here to 5 and 10.
[12:17.690 --> 12:22.450]  Then the inversion blows out and it's clear again.
[12:30.250 --> 12:35.810]  Well this one is the reflection of light. The question is, these are
[12:35.810 --> 12:40.890]  tuned for water and would they affect other things? This one's the reflection
[12:40.890 --> 12:47.010]  of light off of particles, which is highly correlated with human vision.
[12:47.010 --> 12:54.730]  The Campbell Scientific England people are expected to pick up particles in the
[12:54.730 --> 13:00.250]  air, not just water vapor, any kind of particles. It's not too interesting
[13:00.250 --> 13:04.730]  because it's summer. Here's seven days, there's a few spikes. It's summer but it's
[13:04.730 --> 13:14.730]  pretty constant. Temperature, thermistor shields, solar radiation. That's just the
[13:14.730 --> 13:19.050]  shortwave radiation. I think we looked at that. This is multiple replicate sensors
[13:19.050 --> 13:24.410]  on here and they're all reading very close to the same thing. It's comparison
[13:24.410 --> 13:31.930]  of technologies. This also shows power budget. I won't go through this thing, but
[13:31.930 --> 13:37.450]  for people understanding solar-powered stations that take a lot of power, it
[13:37.450 --> 13:41.010]  shows the energy going into the battery and coming out of the battery, the
[13:41.010 --> 13:45.570]  battery flux night and day. This station has a lot of sensors that take a lot of
[13:45.570 --> 13:50.290]  power. Power management is a big deal and it's full of algorithms to turn
[13:50.290 --> 13:56.010]  stuff on and off depending on power availability. This is made possible
[13:56.490 --> 14:03.090]  by the Campbell Scientific CH200 power management system. That gives us a lot
[14:03.090 --> 14:09.290]  more data than we ever used to have. ET and VPD, which is what we're talking
[14:09.290 --> 14:17.090]  about. Here's calculated. Here's the vapor pressure deficit between just the air
[14:17.090 --> 14:22.850]  and then between the surface and the air, the turf surface. We get down to less
[14:22.850 --> 14:28.090]  than one at night and get up to four in the day. Then we run the Penman-Monteith
[14:28.090 --> 14:35.170]  equation. Here's evapotranspiration calculated through the day, yesterday
[14:35.170 --> 14:42.130]  and today. Then a long discussion about ET right there. This shows
[14:42.130 --> 14:48.650]  historical data. There's a lot of graphs on here. Here's air
[14:48.650 --> 14:55.090]  temperatures the last two years. Summer, winter, summer, winter. The min and max for
[14:55.090 --> 15:08.330]  each day. Lots of data and combined climate data and data that the goal is
[15:08.330 --> 15:14.090]  to help educate the campus community for weather data. People get
[15:14.090 --> 15:22.490]  interested in this. Because this has a camera, you can see when somebody
[15:22.490 --> 15:27.010]  stands there. This is a touchscreen kiosk now in front of this which has its own
[15:27.010 --> 15:32.730]  set of graphs. It's particularly edifying to see students come and look
[15:32.730 --> 15:38.930]  at that and study the graphs and look at the sensors. It's a great educational
[15:38.970 --> 15:48.890]  opportunity to teach people about weather. Back to sensible heat.
[15:48.890 --> 16:02.130]  The numerator is delta T. The resistance is determined by the
[16:02.130 --> 16:10.530]  thickness of a tiny layer of dead air right next to all surfaces. Everything
[16:10.530 --> 16:17.930]  has that. This board has that. Our skin has that. That dead air is just
[16:17.930 --> 16:26.170]  like a thermal pane window. A tiny layer that resists the movement of heat. If
[16:26.170 --> 16:34.530]  that layer was gone completely and the resistance approached zero, things would
[16:34.530 --> 16:39.530]  immediately equilibrate with the air. But they never do immediately equilibrate
[16:39.530 --> 16:49.170]  because of this little resistance layer. If we take just the resistance, now
[16:49.170 --> 16:57.130]  this is called resistance BL. Boundary layer because it's a thickness. What
[16:57.130 --> 17:03.410]  we're going to calculate is how thick this airspace is. It's on the order of
[17:03.410 --> 17:09.730]  millimeters. A thermal pane window might be one to two centimeters to
[17:09.730 --> 17:16.210]  trap dead air. This is more like one millimeter, less than a millimeter.
[17:16.210 --> 17:24.690]  Not surprisingly, this is inversely proportional to wind. That's wind speed.
[17:24.690 --> 17:31.370]  There's the fundamental concept. It's proportional to the wind.
[17:31.370 --> 17:38.770]  Lots of heat transfer and a lot of principles of wind, it's not directly
[17:38.770 --> 17:43.690]  proportional. It's proportional to the square root of wind. If the wind
[17:43.690 --> 17:48.490]  doubles, heat transfer doesn't double. It goes up by the square root. It's a
[17:48.490 --> 17:55.050]  nonlinear function of wind. There's one other parameter along with wind that's
[17:55.050 --> 18:04.530]  equally important in here. That's in the numerator. If I put inversely
[18:04.530 --> 18:16.910]  proportional to wind, this is width. The width of the object that the wind is
[18:16.910 --> 18:22.230]  blowing over. In this analysis it's a flat object. We can do this for
[18:22.230 --> 18:26.870]  cylinders and ovals and different shapes, but for a flat object it's
[18:26.870 --> 18:33.550]  proportional to the width. If the width gets bigger, the heat transfer gets
[18:33.550 --> 18:40.870]  less. You can imagine a pine needle would have very efficient heat transfer
[18:40.870 --> 18:45.990]  because it's thin and little. A banana leaf that's a meter wide would have
[18:45.990 --> 18:53.230]  very bad, very poor heat transfer because of width. Now, same thing as wind.
[18:53.230 --> 19:01.630]  It's also proportional to the square root of width. These are the two
[19:01.630 --> 19:06.710]  variables in this that determine the heat transfer. They're both square roots
[19:06.710 --> 19:16.670]  width and wind. Because it's proportional to width, now we look at shapes of leaves.
[19:16.670 --> 19:22.750]  The textbook has some examples of shapes of leaves, but imagine, I'm
[19:22.750 --> 19:31.710]  going to put this up here, some giant banana leaf which would have poor heat
[19:31.710 --> 19:40.830]  transfer characteristics versus some leaf that might look like that. This has
[19:40.830 --> 19:45.070]  much better heat transfer characteristics. In fact, how about a
[19:45.070 --> 19:51.870]  grass leaf? I guess grass would do grasses vertically. Grasses are thin and
[19:51.870 --> 19:57.390]  thin grass leaves have better heat transfer characteristics than wide
[19:57.390 --> 20:05.670]  dicot leaves. Grasses grow more commonly in arid places. You don't see big
[20:05.670 --> 20:12.950]  tropical leaves like this in deserts. You see very thin leaves because they're
[20:12.950 --> 20:16.910]  out of water and they don't want to heat up. They want to be able to
[20:16.910 --> 20:24.270]  blow the heat away. This becomes really fascinating to think about the
[20:24.270 --> 20:29.750]  shapes of leaves and how well they avoid getting hot. If they can avoid
[20:29.750 --> 20:37.590]  getting hot, they can avoid using water too. If they can blow heat away. We have
[20:37.590 --> 20:49.150]  width and wind in this. The rest of this is coefficients to put units on these.
[20:49.150 --> 20:56.310]  After we get the concepts, then you look up these coefficients in a book.
[20:56.310 --> 21:01.990]  To do this to be equal, now we have a coefficient right here.
[21:01.990 --> 21:16.990]  Make sure I got following my notes. I am 0.04 times and because of the rules of
[21:16.990 --> 21:24.990]  algebra we can do width and wind right here. There's boundary layer
[21:24.990 --> 21:40.070]  thickness. In these units, this is boundary layers thickness in meters.
[21:40.070 --> 21:46.510]  It's going to be a small number, a real fraction of the meter. Width has to
[21:46.510 --> 21:54.950]  have units of meters and wind is meters per second, which are the standard units
[21:54.990 --> 22:02.230]  you put those in. This has units to make this all cancel to get to meters.
[22:02.230 --> 22:09.590]  What's this number right here? Why is that 0.004? This is a coefficient
[22:09.590 --> 22:18.910]  that a variable coefficient depending on surface roughness of the object. If it's
[22:18.910 --> 22:27.750]  some polished metal, it's a different coefficient. This can vary from over a
[22:27.750 --> 22:35.070]  factor of two, 0.002 to 0.008 even, depending on how rough the surface is.
[22:35.070 --> 22:40.950]  You can imagine if a leaf is hairy, we call that pubescent and some leaves are
[22:40.950 --> 22:45.910]  really pubescent. They look like they have fur on them. In those leaves, this
[22:45.950 --> 22:51.710]  might be 0.008 because of trapping air. Some furry animal, this might be
[22:51.710 --> 22:56.590]  0.008. I don't know how high a furry animal can get, but dang high I'm sure,
[22:56.590 --> 23:03.590]  versus a real smooth surface where it might be lower. The textbook uses this
[23:03.590 --> 23:08.590]  number and it's a general number for typical leaves. It's higher in hairy
[23:08.590 --> 23:14.470]  leaves and it's a little lower in real smooth glossy leaves. But for these
[23:14.510 --> 23:23.310]  purposes we use 0.004. Now we get a thickness of the leaf in meters.
[23:23.310 --> 23:31.110]  Let me keep going and I'll come back to some filled in examples of this. But we
[23:31.110 --> 23:36.910]  still don't have, we still haven't solved this whole thing because what we want to
[23:36.910 --> 23:43.870]  know up here, I'm going to erase. Now let's leave light and insensible. What we
[23:43.910 --> 23:51.350]  want to get to up here is watts per meter squared. So far all we know is a
[23:51.350 --> 23:58.710]  thickness of the boundary layer. So to put this whole thing in perspective, I'll
[23:58.710 --> 24:01.830]  erase these leaves.
[24:02.270 --> 24:12.150]  We get C squared, I could write this anywhere,
[24:14.710 --> 24:24.350]  delta T over boundary layer thickness in meters. Delta T in degrees Kelvin or
[24:24.350 --> 24:36.190]  degrees C, it doesn't matter, it's the same number. Now we have 0.026 in here.
[24:36.190 --> 24:45.310]  This is the thermal conductivity of air. What's the resistance to heat flow
[24:45.310 --> 24:50.710]  for air? So this has units to make all the rest of this cancel and I'll give
[24:50.710 --> 24:59.510]  you a handout with worked out units. But if the air density was really low, almost
[24:59.510 --> 25:04.390]  a vacuum, this number would get bigger. And if it was more dense it would get
[25:04.390 --> 25:09.150]  higher. This number varies slightly with humidity of the air and
[25:09.150 --> 25:18.910]  temperature, but not very much. It's close to this number. So now we can put
[25:18.910 --> 25:25.830]  numbers and solve this, but there's one final coefficient. Remember for net
[25:25.830 --> 25:31.830]  radiation we had two sides of the leaf. That long wave can go up and it go down
[25:31.830 --> 25:36.550]  and that's a good thing because it helps leaves cool off. If we brand these
[25:36.550 --> 25:42.110]  numbers for the parking lot outside, now we don't get to have two sides of the
[25:42.110 --> 25:46.870]  leaf because the parking lot can only go up. The parking lot would have a big storage
[25:46.950 --> 25:51.030]  component below. But in the case of a leaf there's two sides. Guess what? For
[25:51.030 --> 26:00.150]  conduction and convection, two sides of the leaf. So right here, I'm running out of room,
[26:00.150 --> 26:08.150]  2 times thermal conductivity of air times the delta T times the boundary
[26:08.150 --> 26:14.430]  there. And now we get watts per meter squared of heat transfer from that leaf.
[26:14.790 --> 26:20.110]  And the beauty of this is now we have everything in watts per meter squared.
[26:20.110 --> 26:25.310]  Watts per meter squared, watts per meter squared, watts per meter squared. And now
[26:25.310 --> 26:34.670]  we can look at balancing the energy, what the leaf is doing. So I have a
[26:34.670 --> 26:39.550]  handout of this. It's adapted from the book.
[26:39.550 --> 26:50.670]  This is the same thing I wrote on the board.
[26:50.670 --> 26:59.310]  My goal is to show it and then follow up with the written
[26:59.310 --> 27:07.110]  difference for this. So this is the equation and on the bottom of this,
[27:07.110 --> 27:20.230]  actually not the bottom, it's a page 2, this is a few examples I've written on
[27:20.230 --> 27:26.630]  here. Just a worked out table, leaf width or length. Now what this really is is the
[27:26.630 --> 27:31.270]  shortest dimension. People talk about length, but a grass leaf, it's the
[27:31.270 --> 27:37.070]  shortest dimension because it's generally blown sideways. So here's a
[27:37.070 --> 27:44.350]  banana leaf, 0.5 meters. That's a big leaf. This table is
[27:44.350 --> 27:51.830]  boundary layer thickness in millimeters. A banana leaf with really low wind,
[27:51.830 --> 27:58.190]  almost a centimeter. This is almost like having a thermal
[27:58.190 --> 28:04.430]  pane window around the banana leaf. A centimeter of 8.9 millimeters is
[28:04.430 --> 28:11.190]  pretty thick. So that would not stay in equilibrium with the air very well
[28:11.190 --> 28:16.590]  at all. It would heat up and it would have to evaporate water to balance the
[28:16.590 --> 28:23.470]  energy because it's so well insulated. Now we go up this way and a real thin
[28:23.470 --> 28:29.990]  leaf, 0.002. This is meters. So now this is like a pine needle up here. Now
[28:29.990 --> 28:36.870]  that boundary layer is real tiny. We go this way and these are very still air.
[28:36.870 --> 28:44.230]  This is meters per second. One meter per second is down in here. Smoke would rise
[28:44.350 --> 28:51.990]  vertically. One meter per second is, well, cup anemometers. As you all know, it
[28:51.990 --> 28:57.750]  takes somewhere around 0.4 meters per second to start turning the cups on a
[28:57.750 --> 29:02.830]  cup anemometer. It depends on the instrument. This is very still air.
[29:02.830 --> 29:08.070]  Now we get up to 10 and it's really breezy and all these numbers are
[29:08.070 --> 29:12.950]  small. Leaves are going to always be very close to the air temperature when the
[29:12.950 --> 29:18.150]  wind is blowing because of this gets tiny. Now let's look at this example.
[29:18.150 --> 29:28.670]  It's just one where I've put in the numbers and worked this out. I
[29:28.670 --> 29:34.270]  assumed a delta T of 2. That's pretty typical in the middle of the day. A five
[29:34.270 --> 29:39.430]  centimeter width. So how long is that? Three fingers. It's just some average
[29:39.510 --> 29:45.590]  di-cot leaf. Somewhat still air. The wind is blowing but not very fast. Now we
[29:45.590 --> 29:50.950]  plug in the numbers and there's the boundary layer thickness and here's the
[29:50.950 --> 29:58.750]  rest of it. We get a 116 watts per meter squared transferred by conduction and
[29:58.750 --> 30:05.830]  convection in this example. Just to put this in perspective now,
[30:05.830 --> 30:22.560]  we got this. I'm going to erase this. I'm going to erase this. Let's try red.
[30:22.560 --> 30:30.240]  Remember from a few lectures ago we put some typical numbers in here and this
[30:30.320 --> 30:40.640]  was from the handout. This is 375 watts per meter squared. We don't know this.
[30:40.640 --> 30:52.720]  We're trying to solve for this. 116. So it's pretty easy arithmetic now. 275, 265,
[30:52.720 --> 31:02.440]  would this be 259? I think that balances the equation. This would have to
[31:02.440 --> 31:09.280]  open its stomates and evaporate 259 watts per meter squared to balance this.
[31:09.280 --> 31:16.200]  Assuming there's not storage and all the other stuff. Example of balancing this
[31:16.320 --> 31:29.120]  after we've put the numbers in for conduction and convection. Now I want to
[31:29.120 --> 31:44.800]  show. Yes, now that we've solved this and we know this has to be this.
[31:44.800 --> 31:51.840]  Could you then use this to calculate stomatal resistance or stomatal
[31:51.840 --> 31:57.040]  conductance? The answer is absolutely. That's how we do it. We get the
[31:57.040 --> 32:01.240]  driving gradient for this and the only variable left in this whole thing is
[32:01.240 --> 32:10.680]  stomates. The stomates had to be this open to be able to balance the
[32:10.720 --> 32:15.840]  energy. Once we do that of course then we make models and say in this
[32:15.840 --> 32:21.760]  condition the stomates were like this. Then we try to take our models and put
[32:21.760 --> 32:25.200]  them in and see if the whole thing balances. But that's the beauty of
[32:25.200 --> 32:30.920]  energy balance is we calculate these three numbers and balance the energy.
[32:30.920 --> 32:52.440]  I have another handout. This is a two-sided handout. This is entitled a
[32:52.440 --> 32:59.480]  six-step procedure to determine energy balance components in a leaf.
[32:59.480 --> 33:06.040]  It's all in one page. Just do this, this, this, condensed. Incident is
[33:06.040 --> 33:11.480]  dependent on shortwave. By the way, we often use the Greek letter phi to mean
[33:11.480 --> 33:16.960]  radiation. I always use a capital R but it's the same thing. Phi is radiation.
[33:16.960 --> 33:22.560]  That's shortwave in plus shortwave reflected plus longwave from the sky
[33:22.560 --> 33:27.800]  plus longwave ground. Those are the four components. The sky component we
[33:27.840 --> 33:35.040]  measure directly. The reflected we calculate times the, this is one minus
[33:35.040 --> 33:40.920]  the albedo of the ground. The sky, I had, see how I've crossed this out?
[33:41.480 --> 33:48.080]  Well, we used to calculate the sky but now it's becoming way more common to use
[33:48.080 --> 33:52.480]  an instrument and just measure it directly because we don't have to try
[33:52.480 --> 34:02.160]  and model the sky. Here is an example of a new model instrument to do this.
[34:02.160 --> 34:08.200]  There are several companies that build these. This is one more compact one.
[34:08.200 --> 34:14.200]  You can see this has four sensors, two on the top, two on the bottom. This does all
[34:14.200 --> 34:21.280]  of these components of net radiation. This sensor outputs this number.
[34:21.280 --> 34:27.680]  All in one, you get this number from a single sensor. Shortwave in, shortwave out,
[34:27.680 --> 34:35.800]  longwave in, longwave out. This one's called a four-way radiometer.
[34:35.800 --> 34:42.000]  If these instruments are accurate, wow, we've skipped a lot of modeling to do this.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.560]  See how even here I have calculated the ground based on ground temperature.
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.960]  Now we could cross that out and we could put measure. If you have an instrument
[34:52.960 --> 34:57.160]  to measure it, great. If you don't, you have to calculate it. We keep going down
[34:57.160 --> 35:07.040]  on this. Step two, now we do absorbed radiation. Then we do emitted longwave.
[35:07.040 --> 35:13.640]  Again, following the same. Step four, the permanent radiation. On the first page
[35:13.640 --> 35:21.840]  we got to 375. This doesn't have an example numbers, it's just a summary.
[35:21.840 --> 35:31.040]  Now flip it over. Step five is what we did in the previous lecture. Energy transfer from
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.400]  transpiration. Here's the equation. It's either divided by resistance or times
[35:36.400 --> 35:45.000]  conductance. Now I did an example here. I didn't do an example, I just put the
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.800]  equation. I had to cross these out because this is the latent heat of
[35:51.800 --> 35:59.640]  evaporation right at air temperature. This is not incorrect, it's just a
[35:59.640 --> 36:10.400]  more detailed equation. Let me see if I've got my example of that.
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.880]  I'm not sure I can find that quickly. It's just a chart. Let me show you
[36:15.880 --> 36:18.880]  what this chart looks like. It's the latent heat of evaporation.
[36:18.880 --> 36:56.420]  This is 2.45 megajoules per liter latent heat of evaporation.
[36:56.420 --> 37:07.180]  What does this line look like as water heats up between 0 and 100 degrees C?
[37:07.180 --> 37:18.020]  At 0 this is 2.25 degrees all the way from freezing and at 100 degrees C,
[37:18.020 --> 37:29.660]  2.25 at 100 degrees C and at 0 degrees C,
[37:29.660 --> 37:46.660]  it's about 2.55.
[37:47.020 --> 37:52.700]  The point is latent heat of evaporation varies very little with the initial
[37:52.700 --> 37:59.860]  temperature of the water. It varies a lot with the change of state of water.
[37:59.860 --> 38:06.500]  If we connected our dots, this would be our graph of the effect of water temperature
[38:06.500 --> 38:18.460]  on this coefficient latent heat. Because our measurements are all right in
[38:18.460 --> 38:30.940]  here somewhere, for sure they're all 2.46, 2.43. I simplified this to 2.45.
[38:30.940 --> 38:38.980]  I'm going to come back to this now in just a minute with application at night.
[38:38.980 --> 38:44.580]  We do conduction and convection and here's the rest of the...
[38:44.580 --> 38:50.620]  It's just a one-page summary of this whole thing with delta T.
[38:50.620 --> 39:05.320]  Let's take these principles now. I'm going to show a couple more things on this.
[39:05.320 --> 39:16.120]  These are just examples out of the textbook that are useful examples.
[39:16.120 --> 39:23.040]  Here is the length or diameter of an object and boundary layer thickness.
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.560]  Millimeters, you know, I always think I'm a ruler and looking at the ticks on a
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.680]  ruler. I can conceptualize a millimeter. Don't ask me to conceptualize a
[39:31.680 --> 39:37.320]  micrometer. Those are too small to see. One to three millimeters. Now look at
[39:37.320 --> 39:42.360]  how this curve changes with shape. A flat leaf is different than a sphere and
[39:42.360 --> 39:47.520]  that's different than a cylinder. We can use the same equations to model all
[39:47.520 --> 39:52.520]  kinds of things. Cylinders and different shapes, different roughnesses, but this is
[39:52.520 --> 39:59.480]  how those shapes affected. Then here's just wind speed examples for
[39:59.680 --> 40:07.960]  examples of that. Here's a good example of why
[40:13.240 --> 40:19.080]  width matters. Here's the wind. We have laminar flow in the beginning. It goes
[40:19.080 --> 40:24.600]  turbulent at the end and the heat transfer is better in this first section
[40:24.840 --> 40:31.080]  than it is down here at the end. That's just a illustration of that. I'm
[40:31.080 --> 40:36.480]  sure in a heat transfer class you go over all this stuff in great
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.680]  detail. All this stuff is done in wind tunnels to calculate the heat
[40:41.680 --> 40:48.120]  transfer characteristics of things. We put leaves in wind tunnels to do that.
[40:48.120 --> 41:06.600]  Now I want to go to this little diagram here. I'm going to blow this up big. It's a
[41:06.600 --> 41:15.720]  simple diagram. I'm going to have white underneath it. Make it big. I'm pretty
[41:15.720 --> 41:21.480]  convinced that if you make everything big it gets easier to understand and I
[41:21.600 --> 41:26.640]  think that's why that guy McCulley, he writes those books and he takes, how does
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.280]  this work? He makes it big and then you can understand it. I'm pretty sure
[41:31.280 --> 41:35.080]  if you just can make the diagram big enough it's like a kid's book and you
[41:35.080 --> 41:41.440]  can understand complex things just by making them bigger. Here's big. Here's an
[41:41.440 --> 41:48.560]  example out of the book. Daytime. Net radiation. Here's the conditions here
[41:48.560 --> 41:55.320]  that we've measured with our instruments. 370 in. Well coincidentally we got 375 but
[41:55.320 --> 42:00.320]  they're similar numbers in the day. By the way, this number in the day
[42:00.320 --> 42:08.680]  probably goes from 300 to 500. It depends on the conditions but it's
[42:08.680 --> 42:16.520]  in that general ballpark. Obviously if it's cloudy it's a lot lower and it
[42:16.680 --> 42:23.600]  depends on the surface it's over. It's in the neighborhood of 300.
[42:23.600 --> 42:29.720]  It has to balance. In this example the leaf here is five degrees above the air.
[42:29.720 --> 42:37.560]  This is 180 and we did 116 because the wind wasn't blowing very much.
[42:37.560 --> 42:48.920]  190 for transpiration for the leaf. We can put in water flux density 4 millimoles.
[42:48.920 --> 42:56.120]  I don't know if I want to take the time to work that out but
[42:56.120 --> 43:03.360]  4 millimoles of water. This is a transpiration rate measured of the leaf.
[43:03.360 --> 43:13.680]  That would have to be measured to get this. Times 18 grams per mole.
[43:13.680 --> 43:27.440]  18 grams so 64 milligrams of water.
[43:27.440 --> 43:36.640]  72 milligrams per meter. Everything's per meter squared per second of water.
[43:37.040 --> 43:51.520]  Now times 2.45 and this is a milligram. We're going to have to scale this way down.
[43:51.520 --> 44:04.800]  It's a milliliter. It's not a milliliter, it's a microliter of water.
[44:04.800 --> 44:15.600]  Now we have 2.45 and I'm going to do kilojoules per milliliter.
[44:15.600 --> 44:27.680]  Or to get the microliters, let's get rid of the kilo.
[44:27.680 --> 44:33.720]  This is going to become microliters. The latent heat of evaporation conversion of units
[44:33.840 --> 44:40.160]  2.45 joules per microliter of water. This is the measured transpiration rate.
[44:40.160 --> 44:57.760]  Now what do we get here for joules? 140 joules per meter squared per second.
[44:57.760 --> 45:07.200]  Probably maybe exactly 190. We just did an example of taking a
[45:07.200 --> 45:12.040]  transpiration rate in moles of water, converting it to weight of water,
[45:12.040 --> 45:18.160]  multiplying by latent heat of evaporation to get this number.
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.880]  It's a good thing that worked out. I just thought of doing that right now.
[45:21.920 --> 45:31.200]  This is typical. If the plant is well watered, this can get to 370 and this one
[45:31.200 --> 45:38.200]  can go to zero. When that happens, the leaf is at the exact same temperature as the air.
[45:38.200 --> 45:44.240]  As the plant runs out of water, this has to get bigger until, if the
[45:44.240 --> 45:49.720]  transpiration went to zero, this would have to roughly double.
[45:49.720 --> 45:55.840]  The leaf temperature might be 10 degrees C. The leaf to air delta T to make the energy balance.
[45:55.840 --> 46:02.000]  A little bit more radiation is lost if the leaf gets hot, but not much.
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.320]  You can see how these numbers go back and forth constantly, depending on how
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.360]  well watered the plant is. This is why, if we put infrared sensors on
[46:12.360 --> 46:17.040]  this to get leaf temperature, we can tell the water status of the plant.
[46:17.040 --> 46:24.480]  We can tell how out of water the plant is. Here's the next big thing.
[46:24.480 --> 46:32.720]  Radiation frost, taking these things at night. Here's the moon. He didn't get that
[46:32.720 --> 46:39.760]  Sun anatomically correct. We could fix that right here. I don't really
[46:39.760 --> 46:49.000]  want to draw on the board. You've got to be happy when the Sun's out.
[46:49.000 --> 46:55.280]  Here's the moon at night. Well guess what? This net radiation goes to zero and the
[46:55.280 --> 47:02.560]  sky is cold. On a clear night, net radiation is always a negative number.
[47:02.560 --> 47:09.560]  Assuming the ground is colder than the very cold sky, it's always a
[47:09.560 --> 47:16.680]  negative number. Energy still has to balance. Now these numbers that were
[47:16.680 --> 47:22.760]  going out of the leaf in the day are coming in to make the energy balance.
[47:22.760 --> 47:29.080]  This one's easy. It cools off below air temperature, so it's gaining some heat.
[47:29.080 --> 47:35.120]  Everything reverses itself at night. What's going on here? A negative number.
[47:35.120 --> 47:42.640]  In this case, C is transpiration. I'm not sure why I use the symbol C, but this is
[47:42.640 --> 47:45.640]  transpiration. It's a negative number.
[47:45.640 --> 47:49.480]  Thank you. Thank you Mark.
[47:49.480 --> 47:56.240]  Yep, so L is latent heat and C is conduction and convection. Here's a
[47:56.240 --> 48:04.480]  negative number. What's going on here? It's evaporating water. It's cooling. It
[48:04.480 --> 48:13.120]  could go to zero if the stomates are shut. How'd this go negative? Condensation.
[48:13.120 --> 48:20.880]  Frost. This is a cold night. The air temperature was plus one. The leaf cooled
[48:20.880 --> 48:28.280]  to minus one and the water condensed on it and it was below zero, so it became
[48:28.320 --> 48:36.680]  frost. This is exactly what makes frost form. What happens here is the leaf
[48:36.680 --> 48:47.760]  gains heat by change of state in water. I have a handout right here.
[48:47.760 --> 49:00.320]  This is a whole page handout, but again to make it easy it's big.
[49:00.320 --> 49:10.400]  Here we go. Change of state of water. Once you get this, you have it forever, but
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.000]  it's counterintuitive to people when you first think about it.
[49:14.320 --> 49:20.320]  Heating up water really doesn't take all that much energy. The energy is in
[49:20.320 --> 49:28.280]  change of state of the water. The energy required, mega joules per kilogram, to
[49:28.280 --> 49:35.720]  heat water from zero to a hundred is 0.42. No change of state. There's a big
[49:35.720 --> 49:43.160]  change of temperature, but no change of state. To evaporate, here let's do
[49:43.320 --> 49:49.680]  the liquid to gas. To evaporate it here, after it's at a hundred degrees, 2.25
[49:49.680 --> 49:56.440]  mega joules per kilogram to evaporate it. It takes more energy to evaporate
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.800]  the water than it did to heat it from zero to a hundred. A lot more. What's that?
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.400]  Five times as much to evaporate the water. The big cooling is when the
[50:06.400 --> 50:18.200]  water evaporates. Now I can fix my graph. At zero, no this is a hundred.
[50:18.200 --> 50:28.240]  Nope, I got it right. At a hundred degrees, it's 2.25 to evaporate the water.
[50:28.240 --> 50:32.960]  Now we go the other way. Same thing happens with ice. Now it's going change of
[50:32.960 --> 50:38.960]  state from a solid to a liquid back and forth. Ice, it also takes more energy to
[50:38.960 --> 50:44.160]  freeze the water than it, almost as much to freeze it as it did to cool it from
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.720]  a hundred to zero. When I saw this many years ago, and I'm thinking
[50:49.720 --> 50:54.120]  about it, and I think about every time now I have a fridge that automatically makes
[50:54.120 --> 50:58.160]  ice, but you put ice in your ice cubes and you put them in the fridge,
[50:58.160 --> 51:03.040]  you're waiting and waiting and they're cold but they're not freezing.
[51:03.040 --> 51:06.280]  Then you wait and you wait and BAM! They all freeze at once. That's
[51:06.280 --> 51:11.880]  because this went fast and that final thing took forever to change the
[51:11.880 --> 51:19.400]  state of the ice cubes. In fact, speaking of that, there's a famous question. I've never
[51:19.400 --> 51:23.520]  actually done this experiment. You make ice cubes out of hot water and cold
[51:23.520 --> 51:31.360]  water and put them in your fridge, which one freezes first? That's what you would
[51:31.360 --> 51:38.360]  expect. Which one freezes first? Cold?
[51:38.360 --> 51:48.640]  That's right. Intuitively, the cold water is a lot closer to starting, but what can
[51:48.640 --> 51:53.480]  happen? This is the little trick in this question. You put that hot water in there
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.280]  and it can evaporate like crazy. You put a couple centimeters thick ice
[52:00.280 --> 52:05.160]  cube in the hot water in the process of cooling, it loses energy like crazy. Now
[52:05.160 --> 52:09.040]  your ice cube is only a quarter of an inch thick and you only have to freeze a
[52:09.040 --> 52:14.080]  quarter of an inch. Supposedly you can make ice with hot water and it'll
[52:14.080 --> 52:17.320]  freeze faster, but you won't get much of an ice cube because all the water
[52:17.320 --> 52:23.800]  evaporated. It was all the energy is going here. The goal is to have big
[52:23.800 --> 52:28.480]  ice cubes, so you always start with cold water. There's the
[52:28.480 --> 52:36.280]  principles back and forth. The bottom of this has the... This, by the way,
[52:36.280 --> 52:42.360]  when it goes this way, this is called the latent heat of condensation.
[52:42.880 --> 52:48.000]  This is latent heat of evaporation. We get dew on leaves, heat them up, that goes
[52:48.000 --> 53:04.720]  back and forth. Now we can go from this to one table in the book that I'll go
[53:04.720 --> 53:15.190]  over a bit quickly here. This is the same diagram that I just showed you big.
[53:15.190 --> 53:23.990]  This is page 332, figure 710. Nobel works out four examples with inputs and
[53:23.990 --> 53:29.830]  outputs from leaves. Here's his assumptions down here. It's his first one,
[53:29.830 --> 53:36.990]  sea level, cloudless day, 840 coming in. This isn't quite a thousand, not quite
[53:36.990 --> 53:43.830]  full sunlight, but he ends up with net radiation of 370, which he uses up here. He's got
[53:43.830 --> 53:50.030]  the components of all the things in and out on here. Then he goes to 2,000 meters.
[53:50.030 --> 54:00.350]  Now the incoming radiation is a bit more. The sky is slightly colder.
[54:00.350 --> 54:07.750]  Net radiation is the same. Here's the key, leaf temperature. This is plus 5, but at
[54:07.750 --> 54:11.990]  2,000 meters the leaf temperature is a little bit colder. The sky is a little
[54:11.990 --> 54:17.710]  bit colder and the leaf is a little bit colder. Then he does, and these
[54:17.710 --> 54:22.190]  lead to thousands of interesting test questions, then he does a silvery leaf
[54:22.190 --> 54:30.950]  where the emissivity and absorptivity changes and the albedo
[54:30.950 --> 54:38.310]  changes because of a silvery leaf. All of a sudden, this is on a 2,000 meters,
[54:38.310 --> 54:44.670]  10 degrees and the leaf still heats up three above the air temperature, but the
[54:44.670 --> 54:48.990]  heating is less because the leaf is a different color, more silvery.
[54:48.990 --> 54:56.070]  The last two are really interesting. Sea level, cloudy night. Now it's all
[54:56.070 --> 55:01.190]  zeros here because it's night. Temperature here is 1. This is an example he worked out up
[55:01.190 --> 55:13.150]  here. When there is wind, a light wind, the leaf still froze, minus 1.
[55:13.270 --> 55:18.510]  Then he works out an example right under it with no wind or minimal wind,
[55:18.510 --> 55:26.350]  and the leaf went to minus 9 below the air temperature. That is the
[55:26.350 --> 55:35.070]  definition of a radiation frost, which I put right here. When a surface goes below
[55:35.070 --> 55:43.710]  the air temperature and below freezing, frost forms on it. It happens
[55:43.710 --> 55:47.350]  all the time on clear nights because they get below the air temperature,
[55:47.350 --> 55:51.270]  there's condensation, and the condensation freezes. That's what
[55:51.270 --> 55:57.950]  frost is. If it happens all night long, the frost can get enormously long.
[55:57.950 --> 56:05.110]  It's all because of this radiant cooling at night. This is so profound
[56:05.110 --> 56:33.040]  that fruit growers in the spring have to be
[56:33.040 --> 56:38.720]  continuously worried about radiation frost. In the past, they've just looked at
[56:38.720 --> 56:43.120]  air temperature, and in one night they can lose a million dollars worth of
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.920]  fruit because their young flowers get cold and they freeze and they're done.
[56:47.920 --> 56:55.080]  Their yield is done for the year. They cannot afford to just do frost
[56:55.080 --> 57:00.120]  protection based on air temperature. They have to do it based on surface
[57:00.120 --> 57:07.960]  temperature, and particularly in their case of the flower buds.
[57:07.960 --> 57:13.560]  You can buy an instrument that's a black flat plate that simulates a leaf at
[57:13.560 --> 57:19.840]  night and put it out, and that flat plate gets colder than the air and attach a
[57:19.840 --> 57:26.720]  sensor to it. Then also a single black sensor that in a sensor
[57:26.720 --> 57:32.000]  give a grower a sense of the radiation frost from a direct measurement, as
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.320]  opposed to calculating it with all the other parameters of a weather station.
[57:36.320 --> 57:43.200]  Fruit crops in Utah are a much bigger agricultural sector than most people
[57:43.200 --> 57:47.800]  realize. Michigan and Utah are the two top producers in the nation for
[57:47.800 --> 57:53.360]  tart cherries. It's a multi-million dollar industry, and it's all
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.520]  concentrated here in the northern part of Utah. In recent years we've done a
[57:58.520 --> 58:05.240]  lot to help fruit growers tell when to protect against radiation frost.
[58:05.240 --> 58:10.640]  I'm going to stop here with this section, especially since I made it to the end of
[58:10.640 --> 58:21.200]  my list. After break we'll pick this up and talk about the applications of
[58:21.200 --> 58:28.920]  radiation frost and summarize all of the lectures with examples of this.
