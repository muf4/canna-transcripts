[00:01.660 --> 00:26.850]  The next topic, I'm going to do two at once or they're real short, leaf
[00:26.850 --> 00:33.250]  chlorophyll. We have a chlorophyll meter here. This is the instrument,
[00:33.250 --> 00:40.130]  self-contained digital readout. Clamp on a leaf and this tells you the amount of
[00:40.130 --> 00:45.570]  chlorophyll in the leaf, which is particularly useful for assessing plant
[00:45.570 --> 00:52.730]  health. Because it's self-contained, pretty easy to use. It's a useful
[00:52.730 --> 01:00.930]  instrument. This isn't going to read much right now because that's, I don't know, I
[01:00.930 --> 01:04.450]  can pass it around. Didn't get to read much right now because we don't have a
[01:04.450 --> 01:11.250]  leaf here. How does this work to measure chlorophyll? Let's install the power
[01:11.250 --> 01:19.290]  buttons. If you hold the leaf up and look at it, you can tell how green it is.
[01:19.290 --> 01:23.010]  If it's a thicker leaf and darker green, it's got more chlorophyll. Just by
[01:23.010 --> 01:28.970]  looking at it, you get a sense of that. You shine a beam of red light through
[01:28.970 --> 01:35.250]  the leaf and if most of that's absorbed, that indicates high chlorophyll in the
[01:35.250 --> 01:40.250]  leaf. If that was the case, we'd be done. We just shine a light through it and
[01:40.250 --> 01:46.570]  red is a wavelength highly absorbed by chlorophyll. We could relate the
[01:46.570 --> 01:52.770]  transmission of red light to the amount of chlorophyll, but cell walls and all
[01:52.770 --> 01:59.810]  the cellulose in a leaf also absorb light. A leaf with not too much
[01:59.810 --> 02:06.290]  chlorophyll but thick and a lot of cell wall material would not transmit light.
[02:06.290 --> 02:13.770]  We shine two beams of light through it, one at 930 nanometers, a
[02:13.770 --> 02:17.570]  wavelength that chlorophyll doesn't absorb bad and the other one that it
[02:17.570 --> 02:22.450]  does. By ratioing the wavelengths, we can separate out the amount of
[02:22.450 --> 02:28.250]  chlorophyll from all the other material in the leaf, the structural material.
[02:28.250 --> 02:34.610]  It shines through and hits a detector and then the leaf gives us a
[02:34.610 --> 02:42.170]  reading of the ratio of those two wavelengths. This is a fairly old
[02:42.170 --> 02:52.810]  technology. These meters are sold by a couple of companies, but it only gives
[02:52.810 --> 02:59.290]  you a relative index of chlorophyll. This would be great if we
[02:59.290 --> 03:02.450]  walked outside. If this doesn't need sunlight, it's got its own lights. If we
[03:02.450 --> 03:06.450]  had a leaf you could measure it. We can play around with it at the break.
[03:06.450 --> 03:11.930]  We can measure some of those leaves out there. It only gives you an index of
[03:11.930 --> 03:18.050]  chlorophyll. If the reading says 10 and another leaf says 5, you conclude that
[03:18.050 --> 03:23.130]  one has doubled the chlorophyll. That's not true. It's incorrect because it's an
[03:23.130 --> 03:30.130]  index and it's non-linearly related to chlorophyll.
[03:30.610 --> 03:35.770]  Here's the wavelengths. I'll show you a couple. This is the classic
[03:35.770 --> 03:41.850]  transmission and reflectance signature of any plant. A little hump right here in
[03:41.850 --> 03:47.090]  the green, a dip in the red and up where all the pigments are gone now over here.
[03:47.090 --> 03:56.450]  That's just transmission of the non-pigmented wavelengths, the cellulose.
[03:56.570 --> 04:02.970]  Every time we do reflectance we're looking for subtle changes in the
[04:02.970 --> 04:14.770]  slopes of these lines. This just measures 991, 653 and the ratio of these
[04:14.770 --> 04:21.130]  is called the chlorophyll concentration index. That's not in this
[04:21.130 --> 04:27.250]  meter yet, but this is 7.5 and the bigger the number the more chlorophyll.
[04:27.250 --> 04:36.290]  Now we look at the index for chlorophyll measured by this meter and the actual
[04:36.290 --> 04:40.570]  chlorophyll. You take a sample of the leaf, extract the chlorophyll, measure it
[04:40.570 --> 04:45.570]  in a spectrophotometer in the lab with the cellulose gone. These are curved
[04:45.570 --> 04:59.520]  lines, they're always curved for all species. There's 7.5, here's a
[04:59.520 --> 05:05.360]  difference of 10. This is SPAD units, maybe you haven't
[05:05.360 --> 05:09.160]  ever heard of a SPAD meter down here, but that's another chlorophyll meter.
[05:09.160 --> 05:14.800]  Here's the index, but the apparent difference is 4 and the real difference
[05:14.920 --> 05:21.000]  is only 3. These are reproducible differences. We programmed that meter
[05:21.000 --> 05:29.320]  in software with equations for multiple species to linearize this line.
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.720]  That meter reads out in moles of chlorophyll per meter squared of leaf,
[05:33.720 --> 05:40.480]  the real chlorophyll on leaf not an index for it. This is a recently released
[05:40.480 --> 05:46.920]  product to do chlorophyll and that's how it works with equations in software.
[05:46.920 --> 05:53.440]  These are the species that are programmed in and
[05:53.440 --> 05:59.000]  not surprisingly lots of economic agricultural species. It also has a
[05:59.000 --> 06:05.960]  generic index for species that haven't been precisely characterized yet.
[06:05.960 --> 06:11.760]  The difference is reading out in a physiological unit amount of chlorophyll
[06:11.760 --> 06:17.040]  per meter squared rather than just some index. For physiological studies we're
[06:17.040 --> 06:26.720]  really interested in that. Interpretation of the data is interesting because high
[06:26.720 --> 06:34.440]  chlorophyll doesn't always mean high plant health. In low-light plants can
[06:34.520 --> 06:38.720]  make a lot of chlorophyll to have dark green leaves to capture every photon
[06:38.720 --> 06:46.800]  they can. Its single biggest use in agriculture is to look at nitrogen
[06:46.800 --> 06:54.760]  status of plants. When plants start to get incipient nitrogen stress, chlorophyll
[06:54.760 --> 06:59.160]  is one of the first things to go. The leaves start to get slightly less
[06:59.160 --> 07:04.680]  dark green and this meter can detect those and tell people it's time to
[07:04.680 --> 07:13.280]  fertilize your crop. Our eyes are so keenly attuned to color that our eyes
[07:13.280 --> 07:20.560]  are great monitors of color. Anyone of us could walk outside and say these plants
[07:20.560 --> 07:24.640]  are a little bit more green than these, just barely, but I can see it and we
[07:24.640 --> 07:30.160]  would all agree. If we pick two leaves and we said this one is greener than
[07:30.160 --> 07:38.920]  this, why would we need a meter if we can see the difference in color?
[07:38.920 --> 07:41.880]  Put them behind your back.
[07:44.880 --> 07:49.840]  You literally can do this. You put them behind your back.
[07:49.840 --> 07:54.040]  Now which leaf is that? I can't remember, give me the other one to
[07:54.040 --> 07:59.800]  compare it to. We have no memory for color, we just have an exquisite ability
[07:59.800 --> 08:04.440]  to compare it. Especially day after day you're measuring this and you see
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.840]  the chlorophyll getting slightly downhill. That's the value of a
[08:09.840 --> 08:15.080]  chlorophyll meter. Not only does it digitize it so anybody anywhere
[08:15.200 --> 08:22.600]  could use the number, but it also has memory for tracking it over time.
[08:25.280 --> 08:37.580]  I might go back to this slide, this one here, even this picture
[08:37.580 --> 08:44.540]  without all this. This is related to remote sensing because even though this
[08:44.540 --> 08:48.140]  is the transmission of light going through a leaf, when you think of the
[08:48.140 --> 08:55.100]  optics of what happens to light hitting a leaf, if we draw it here.
[08:57.620 --> 09:04.220]  Here's the cross-section of a leaf with a bunch of cells in here. Here's some
[09:04.540 --> 09:14.980]  light coming in. The wavelengths, and I might draw this this way, the wavelengths
[09:14.980 --> 09:21.180]  that are transmitted are the same ones that are reflected. Reflectance and
[09:21.180 --> 09:26.740]  transmission of lights are basically the same process. Once that photon bounces
[09:26.740 --> 09:36.180]  off a surface, some bounces up and some bounces down. The signature for
[09:36.180 --> 09:41.460]  reflected light is the same for reflectance as it is for transmission.
[09:41.460 --> 09:50.620]  They're like mirror images of each other. If you use a spectroradiometer and put
[09:50.620 --> 09:56.260]  it on top, you get this exact same shape of occurred for reflected light. This one
[09:56.340 --> 10:01.020]  just works a little bit better by doing transmitted light. That principle is
[10:01.020 --> 10:12.030]  helpful in remote sensing for measuring reflectance and transmission.
[10:12.030 --> 10:22.110]  I think that's all I want to say about leaf chlorophyll. It's a simple
[10:22.110 --> 10:27.550]  process, I guess because it's simple, you don't have a big learning
[10:27.590 --> 10:35.510]  curve to learn to use the meters. Like I say, fertilizer companies sometimes
[10:35.510 --> 10:41.350]  have sold this meter to growers to help them tell when to fertilize. Have any of
[10:41.350 --> 10:49.030]  you used this meter here in crop production? They're fairly widely
[10:49.030 --> 10:57.030]  used commercially and mostly for fertilization scheduling of nitrogen.
[10:57.550 --> 11:01.550]  How is used to measure the greenness of the turf?
[11:06.550 --> 11:10.950]  Well, turf is almost always doing reflectance. It's pretty hard to do
[11:10.950 --> 11:15.790]  transmission and turf leaves are real tiny, but it's the same concept.
[11:15.790 --> 11:24.790]  If it's changing color, it can change color because of moisture stress too.
[11:27.990 --> 11:35.750]  Yes, I agree, but it's mostly because the instrument can remember. It's a tiny bit
[11:35.750 --> 11:41.230]  less green than it was yesterday. Like I said, we had no memory for
[11:41.230 --> 11:44.230]  color.
