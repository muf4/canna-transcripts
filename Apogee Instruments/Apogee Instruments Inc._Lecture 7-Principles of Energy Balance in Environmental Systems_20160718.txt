[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Summarize this and I
[00:02.960 --> 00:05.780]  Remember to get my space blanket out of my car
[00:06.640 --> 00:08.280]  so
[00:08.280 --> 00:10.280]  You can all understand
[00:15.400 --> 00:20.560]  Everyone should carry one of these for emergencies like in their back pocket
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.680]  They might become more important than your cell phone right there, but
[00:26.680 --> 00:30.160]  And I think mostly you can buy these at camping
[00:31.560 --> 00:33.520]  That's where people end up using them
[00:33.520 --> 00:34.680]  but I
[00:34.680 --> 00:36.680]  Think these are so good car
[00:36.840 --> 00:42.020]  Manufacturers should all have a be required to have a little pocket in the door and they're one of these comes with the car in
[00:42.020 --> 00:46.000]  The pocket and if you ever get stranded in a cold place and you
[00:47.320 --> 00:49.320]  Can use it
[00:49.480 --> 00:55.200]  We ended the last lecture talking about radiation for us. So I'm gonna give some examples of that
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.400]  Here's a picture of a radiation frost detector just a flat black disk
[01:00.640 --> 01:08.160]  So you can see how nicely that radiates to space doesn't work at all in the day because it keeps way up above air
[01:08.200 --> 01:10.200]  Temperature but it's designed to only do at night
[01:10.880 --> 01:12.880]  So here's an example graph
[01:13.800 --> 01:15.800]  of what this looks like
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.720]  at night and
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.440]  This was a few years ago air temperature
[01:22.360 --> 01:28.800]  Bud and leaf now bud temperature is a single little sensor about the size of a fruit bud and
[01:29.640 --> 01:34.560]  Here's a classic example of this. The air is everybody's above the
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.840]  Zero Celsius, so we're all happy but right here. The air temperature is plus three and
[01:42.560 --> 01:44.080]  the wind
[01:44.080 --> 01:47.040]  This is here's wind speed the wind died. Oh
[01:48.280 --> 01:50.280]  Can I go back?
[01:52.280 --> 01:54.280]  I
[01:59.840 --> 02:03.280]  Am going backwards here, let's see
[02:04.720 --> 02:06.720]  We got it
[02:06.760 --> 02:08.760]  We got to get back to that page
[02:20.430 --> 02:22.590]  We were close to there
[02:23.190 --> 02:26.470]  And we got to start now around the way back, okay
[02:31.510 --> 02:33.510]  There we go
[02:37.190 --> 02:39.190]  There we go, thank you
[02:39.790 --> 02:41.790]  the wind dies and
[02:42.110 --> 02:47.070]  The temperature separate and we have the beginning of a leaf starting to freeze
[02:47.830 --> 02:49.830]  Because it's below air temperature
[02:50.070 --> 02:53.030]  So now the wind picks up and not enough
[02:53.030 --> 03:00.150]  It's still calm wind and then the wind dies here and these separate and now clear these leaf has been below freezing for several
[03:00.150 --> 03:05.030]  Hours and then the finally the little tiny bud even goes below freezing
[03:05.470 --> 03:11.270]  So the blue line or at least the red line is what a grower ought to be after not just the
[03:11.710 --> 03:15.230]  Black line and historically they've used the black line
[03:15.270 --> 03:20.830]  So now we can go back to our our camera
[03:22.350 --> 03:27.550]  What do growers do to protect against frost this is a huge
[03:28.430 --> 03:32.590]  Industry and it's common to have problems. That's why fruit
[03:33.270 --> 03:39.630]  Orchards are located on this tops of valleys on the edges because the cold air drains to the middle
[03:39.670 --> 03:46.910]  Located on this tops of valleys on the edges because the cold air drains to the middle and they're somewhat protected by elevation
[03:47.630 --> 03:53.350]  We don't have fruit orchards in the middle of the valley. They're up along the benches to for tip for that reason
[03:55.630 --> 04:01.070]  Many years ago, and I remember this as a kid grew up in, Minnesota
[04:02.070 --> 04:09.630]  Reading about the Florida fruit growers oranges in Florida and they would get these frosts late spring frosts
[04:09.630 --> 04:13.550]  There's tender buds are out. So here is a picture of
[04:16.230 --> 04:18.230]  Some fruit trees
[04:21.890 --> 04:23.570]  Somewhere
[04:23.570 --> 04:25.570]  Don't have to be in Florida
[04:26.010 --> 04:29.850]  The most common way to protect your fruit trees
[04:30.370 --> 04:34.290]  Was to light this thing called a smudge pot
[04:37.570 --> 04:44.810]  And it was designed to burn really inefficiently and make a whole bunch of black smoke and they never got all that hot
[04:45.410 --> 04:47.410]  But this black smoke
[04:48.570 --> 04:50.570]  Would go up like this and
[04:50.890 --> 04:51.630]  Guess what?
[04:51.630 --> 04:58.570]  They've just blocked the cold night sky and this was effective for protecting trees against this radiation frost
[04:59.170 --> 05:00.490]  Because that
[05:00.490 --> 05:05.850]  emissivity was blocked and these were used for decades by fruit growers and they'd
[05:06.050 --> 05:10.650]  have them all over their orchards and they'd go out and light the smudge pots and
[05:11.250 --> 05:14.650]  Well, they really make bad air pollution
[05:14.930 --> 05:20.450]  So they were banned and now what are the growers going to do to?
[05:21.650 --> 05:23.650]  Keep their fruit crops alive
[05:24.290 --> 05:25.650]  well
[05:25.650 --> 05:28.010]  If they could increase the wind
[05:29.010 --> 05:35.690]  That would help them. So I don't have a picture here, but they're not hard to find the smudge pots go away
[05:36.410 --> 05:38.410]  and
[05:38.770 --> 05:43.930]  There are pictures on the internet of huge towers they look like
[05:45.650 --> 05:48.050]  Reverse electric wind generators
[05:48.970 --> 05:52.730]  Blown wind over their crops all through the orchard
[05:53.130 --> 05:58.450]  To mix the air and these are cooling by radiation, but they're warming them back up by wind
[05:58.450 --> 06:01.090]  So they both prevent inversions because of the wind
[06:01.610 --> 06:04.970]  but they also mix the air so that they
[06:05.370 --> 06:10.010]  The airflow over the leaves warms them up and they don't have a radiation frost
[06:10.010 --> 06:12.610]  They just have leaves similar temperature of the air
[06:13.170 --> 06:14.690]  so
[06:14.690 --> 06:16.690]  wind is is a
[06:17.450 --> 06:23.170]  Solution but these wind generators and I've talked to some of the fruit growers in Utah
[06:24.410 --> 06:26.410]  They tell me they cost
[06:26.970 --> 06:28.970]  $10,000 per hour
[06:29.730 --> 06:35.010]  To run that these are big wind generators and if they're super expensive
[06:35.890 --> 06:38.610]  And of course I'm going geez, you know
[06:38.610 --> 06:42.130]  Wouldn't you like to just put a few thousand into a lot of really careful?
[06:42.250 --> 06:47.190]  Monitoring because if you could just not run this for an hour you paid for your whole weather station
[06:47.690 --> 06:53.050]  So we're getting there but better better monitoring so they can pinpoint when they have to turn these on
[06:53.570 --> 06:57.590]  But this is they pay for themselves the value of the fruit so much but now
[06:58.410 --> 07:01.890]  There's the third technique that's getting more and more popular
[07:02.650 --> 07:04.650]  and you're gonna
[07:04.770 --> 07:07.570]  Love this picture. This was the cover of
[07:08.250 --> 07:12.810]  The American Society for horticultural science a few years ago
[07:15.610 --> 07:19.770]  And this is a fruit tree crop, I think this was in Florida
[07:20.730 --> 07:23.210]  dwarf fruit trees are in pots and
[07:23.890 --> 07:29.370]  It's the first thing in the morning and you would go. Oh, what a bummer, you know, his crop is ruined
[07:30.330 --> 07:32.330]  But this grower is so happy
[07:33.610 --> 07:36.450]  And you see that sprinkler right there
[07:38.130 --> 07:43.930]  This is using latent heat of condensation to keep his trees warm
[07:44.810 --> 07:48.370]  They go below freezing. He turns on the sprinkler and
[07:49.090 --> 07:50.970]  This is cold water
[07:50.970 --> 07:54.290]  but when that water freezes it releases heat and
[07:55.370 --> 07:57.370]  It warms the leaves
[07:57.690 --> 08:01.810]  Only once you start this you have to keep going all night long because it can't stop
[08:01.890 --> 08:05.010]  But he keeps running the sprinklers the water keeps freezing
[08:05.730 --> 08:07.650]  Doesn't pollute the air
[08:07.650 --> 08:09.770]  Doesn't cost ten thousand dollars an hour
[08:09.770 --> 08:16.650]  he's just running his sprinklers, but it's using physical principles to prevent frost in his crops and
[08:18.090 --> 08:23.650]  This is now the most widely used method of frost protection. It makes a mess
[08:23.650 --> 08:28.170]  There's mud everywhere and a yacht uses water, but he uses water in the early spring
[08:28.170 --> 08:33.770]  There's usually more water and it's way way cheaper than running these fans. So it depends on the orchard
[08:33.970 --> 08:36.730]  This is harder to do. Of course if the trees are big
[08:37.570 --> 08:40.690]  but it's a great principle and when I
[08:42.170 --> 08:44.850]  Saw this and started thinking about this. I
[08:46.250 --> 08:48.850]  Think I have a data logger in my house
[08:49.490 --> 08:56.010]  And I run a wire out in my yard at the thermocouple and put it next to my garden
[08:56.810 --> 09:02.950]  And I didn't want to automate this because why miss all the fun. I had to turn on a radio when the
[09:03.810 --> 09:05.810]  temperature got below freezing
[09:05.890 --> 09:10.730]  So I get up and put on my slippers and go turn on my irrigation controller
[09:10.730 --> 09:13.850]  And this is a picture of my garden in
[09:14.690 --> 09:18.330]  82 Crockett Avenue on one morning after a radiation frost
[09:18.330 --> 09:22.130]  It's a little glary, but this looks like those orchards all covered with ice
[09:22.770 --> 09:25.810]  Nothing froze. I had tomatoes that made it through the night
[09:27.290 --> 09:32.650]  It was a great achievement and of course, I'm monitoring how the temperature went with thermocouples out in my garden
[09:32.650 --> 09:34.730]  So this isn't just a theoretical thing
[09:34.730 --> 09:38.570]  You can do this in your yard to keep your tomatoes going longer in the fall
[09:38.570 --> 09:40.810]  And all you have to do is pay for the water bill
[09:42.890 --> 09:47.570]  No, it just it just sits there and freezes and protects them
[09:47.930 --> 09:54.330]  It doesn't it it could I suppose but it's if it if it got a heavy and a branch broke off
[09:54.330 --> 10:01.450]  It could damage the plant but but it doesn't happen all at once. It's just a little tiny freezing and it gradually
[10:01.890 --> 10:03.890]  builds up
[10:14.570 --> 10:19.490]  So this our frosts are depends exactly where you live when the frosts are there they're later
[10:20.290 --> 10:23.770]  Campus than they are in the middle of the valley, but in the middle of valley
[10:23.770 --> 10:27.890]  We're sometime in September and into early October
[10:28.330 --> 10:34.450]  But the problem is you get one frost and then you might get where you call that Indian summer two or three weeks of nice
[10:34.450 --> 10:37.050]  weather you can take advantage of that if you
[10:37.570 --> 10:39.570]  If your plants weren't didn't freeze
[10:41.130 --> 10:43.250]  Yeah late September
[10:49.330 --> 10:52.570]  Yes, so that so the question is what happens in the day
[10:52.970 --> 11:00.130]  Well now the Sun comes up and the radiations more favorable and the Sun shines on it and it melts the ice and they're fine
[11:00.850 --> 11:05.650]  Yeah, you could you could probably keep irrigating and and melt it off or something
[11:05.650 --> 11:10.290]  But but if the Sun melts it off and that's actually kind of important that it doesn't
[11:11.010 --> 11:12.850]  thaw of immediately
[11:12.850 --> 11:14.530]  but it's
[11:14.530 --> 11:19.810]  Typically a cold clear night is followed by a sunny day
[11:20.250 --> 11:25.850]  It's clear at night. It's clear the next morning. So it warms up and you can melt all the ice and
[11:26.690 --> 11:30.810]  The temperature swings are big so and it just barely went below freezing
[11:30.810 --> 11:35.510]  So the next day is it pretty easily melts all the ice the next day
[11:37.850 --> 11:43.290]  So this is one of those things you ought to try this at home because it works and you just need a little
[11:43.450 --> 11:48.090]  Controller to tell when it turn the sprinklers on you need to know when to turn them on
[11:48.730 --> 11:52.450]  Because you make it worse if you turn them on too early, it's not freezing now
[11:52.450 --> 11:58.650]  It's wet and now it makes them colder. It only makes a more when there really are a below freezing
[11:59.130 --> 12:04.650]  So you want to get the timing just right and calculate the leaf surface temperatures and when they're freezing
[12:04.730 --> 12:08.490]  Then you start and then they have the plants can take
[12:09.690 --> 12:11.690]  minus one below freezing
[12:12.410 --> 12:18.130]  But they can't take minus two or three and this keeps them right close to freezing
[12:19.610 --> 12:21.610]  so a
[12:23.410 --> 12:25.850]  Couple other follow-up things on
[12:31.250 --> 12:33.250]  Conduction and convection
[12:33.450 --> 12:35.530]  This is an article
[12:36.130 --> 12:42.090]  From a few years ago a newspaper article nice concise summary
[12:42.890 --> 12:46.730]  but many people know everybody knows about windchill and
[12:47.650 --> 12:49.650]  if you grow up in a really
[12:50.130 --> 12:55.770]  Cold place and it's windy in the winter. The wind shows way colder than the air temperature and
[12:56.290 --> 13:00.890]  When I was a kid growing up, they closed schools because the wind show got so cold that
[13:01.410 --> 13:03.170]  They just closed the school
[13:03.170 --> 13:09.770]  Well, it turns out the wind chill factor was initially a really crude factor by a guy in
[13:10.090 --> 13:15.490]  Antarctica putting a can of water out and then looking at wind and how long it took the water to freeze
[13:15.690 --> 13:17.690]  And he made this crude index
[13:18.170 --> 13:20.970]  so much later people came along with
[13:22.370 --> 13:29.970]  biophysical principles of heat transfer and made a new wind chill factor and what they found was this guy
[13:30.570 --> 13:37.850]  Overestimated it and so it's really not as cold as it seems when we have the corrected index and
[13:39.650 --> 13:45.170]  People were slow to use the new one because everyone likes to brag about how cold it is and it's really not as bad
[13:45.170 --> 13:47.970]  as it seems but this is a short summary of this and
[13:49.690 --> 13:52.830]  Calculating the the wind chill we do that by the way on campus
[13:52.830 --> 13:56.090]  We have a line for wind chill and the winter how cold it gets
[13:56.530 --> 14:02.010]  But it's it's a great and now this is widely used I mean now people when they do the school closings
[14:02.010 --> 14:08.050]  They don't use the embellished wind chill factor. They use the real one and it's a nice summary of that
[14:20.230 --> 14:22.230]  So
[14:23.550 --> 14:25.190]  I've had these
[14:25.190 --> 14:27.070]  beads up here
[14:27.070 --> 14:32.190]  For a for a couple of days. Can you see those Chris and this and this thing?
[14:32.630 --> 14:35.190]  And I forgot to show these to you the other day
[14:37.350 --> 14:38.030]  I
[14:38.030 --> 14:43.990]  Had occurred to me to make this a couple years ago when I was asked to do a TED talk on water
[14:43.990 --> 14:48.470]  and I wanted to find ways to emphasize what's in the air and
[14:49.350 --> 14:50.750]  So we went to
[14:50.750 --> 14:57.350]  Al sporting goods and bought a bunch of these little white pellets and then we had to paint them colors to get this
[14:57.830 --> 14:59.750]  But this big jar
[14:59.790 --> 15:01.950]  Represents the nitrogen in the air
[15:05.510 --> 15:09.630]  20.95% this is the oxygen in the air
[15:11.430 --> 15:13.630]  This one is the carbon dioxide
[15:14.710 --> 15:16.710]  There's 10,000 of these
[15:18.270 --> 15:19.430]  BBs
[15:19.430 --> 15:21.430]  to every four and
[15:21.590 --> 15:23.910]  And the point is wow
[15:24.710 --> 15:28.910]  The plants have to find those four molecules to for photosynthesis
[15:28.910 --> 15:36.390]  That's just remarkable and here's what we get to work with we have 20.95% for our breathing, but here's the other thing
[15:37.710 --> 15:38.870]  water
[15:38.870 --> 15:41.950]  You look at what's in the air and nobody ever mentions water
[15:42.470 --> 15:48.030]  Because water is so variable these are other ones are very constant. So now we add water to this
[15:49.670 --> 15:53.510]  So if you counted these I made this example
[15:54.590 --> 15:57.350]  3% water which is
[15:58.670 --> 16:00.670]  a
[16:00.670 --> 16:05.070]  Typical day in the summer if this was air in the winter
[16:05.070 --> 16:09.950]  And if this was a real thing I could take this and I would just pour a bunch of these out
[16:09.950 --> 16:11.950]  So there's just a few left
[16:11.990 --> 16:16.550]  Winter air hardly has any water in it. It is so cold the water can't hold anything
[16:16.550 --> 16:22.870]  So this jar would just have a few water molecules in it if we made hot humid air
[16:23.550 --> 16:26.910]  This could get this could double this
[16:27.550 --> 16:35.350]  Amount of water vapor in the air, but I've always liked this because it's a nice concise visual demonstration of nitrogen
[16:35.910 --> 16:38.030]  oxygen water vapor and
[16:38.670 --> 16:44.510]  CO2 and all the other stuff like there's a little argon and the other stuff we can ignore
[16:45.350 --> 16:48.150]  But we certainly can't ignore these four co2
[16:48.230 --> 16:53.910]  When I was a kid there's a there would have been three in this jar
[16:54.390 --> 16:58.430]  Now you know how old I am but old enough to remember when there was three in this jar
[16:58.430 --> 17:01.230]  And now we got this up to four and we're working
[17:01.950 --> 17:07.110]  Another 20 30 years we might get it up to five in the jar. That's that
[17:07.950 --> 17:14.830]  400 parts per million four in that jar, but it's a great visual demonstration of what's in them air I
[17:15.830 --> 17:20.870]  Suppose I could do this with some leaf and have these inside the leaf and in the air and
[17:21.190 --> 17:26.990]  Then you could even have them kind of falling out of the leaf to show transpiration rate, and it's probably a lot you could do with
[17:27.950 --> 17:32.430]  BBs from L's trophy or L's sporting goods. It's a great thing
[17:35.470 --> 17:41.230]  Now we want to switch a bit. Oh, let me another miscellaneous couple other miscellaneous things
[17:41.230 --> 17:44.310]  They're interesting this came up the other day a little bit
[17:46.150 --> 17:52.950]  Comfort box on a psychometric table. I'll look this up this here's the same psychometric chart. This is for the space station
[17:53.710 --> 17:59.270]  Humidity and temperature interact so they say we try to get in this box, and then people are comfortable
[17:59.790 --> 18:04.870]  And it varies a little bit with humidity so when when you do building control
[18:04.870 --> 18:09.550]  You try to arrange your humidity and temperature to be in the comfort box for the room
[18:10.430 --> 18:12.430]  It also came up the
[18:14.590 --> 18:16.590]  Effective pressure on
[18:17.870 --> 18:19.870]  This psychometric chart
[18:20.430 --> 18:22.430]  So I thought of a way to show this
[18:23.350 --> 18:25.350]  This is a psychometric chart
[18:25.950 --> 18:33.070]  For sea level I probably can zoom in just slightly on this and it looks exactly like the ones we handed out now
[18:33.070 --> 18:39.030]  This has other factors in here has enthalpy and things, but this is the chart for sea level now
[18:40.030 --> 18:41.790]  I made a
[18:41.790 --> 18:43.310]  transparency
[18:43.310 --> 18:45.310]  of the exact same chart
[18:45.910 --> 18:50.150]  For our elevation. I didn't make it. I looked it up and printed it
[18:50.670 --> 18:55.630]  so I'm gonna lay this on top of this and trying to line up the zeros and
[18:56.470 --> 19:01.310]  They look pretty close. They're not exact, but they're pretty close
[19:02.270 --> 19:04.270]  So when you look at these
[19:04.870 --> 19:08.460]  The
[19:09.060 --> 19:14.220]  Shift is like this as you go to high elevation
[19:15.300 --> 19:18.060]  this saturation curve shifts up and
[19:19.060 --> 19:25.900]  Here's 1500 meters, and here's sea level and I looked at the numbers for 28 C and
[19:27.100 --> 19:32.900]  the absolute humidity for 100% at 28 C at sea levels
[19:33.620 --> 19:34.940]  24.6 and
[19:35.020 --> 19:39.060]  In in Logan, it's 29 now. That's a big difference
[19:39.860 --> 19:41.860]  but after you
[19:42.540 --> 19:44.540]  divide for air pressure
[19:45.220 --> 19:52.980]  This number is 86% of that number and our pressure is 86% of sea level
[19:53.460 --> 19:54.500]  so
[19:54.500 --> 19:57.060]  When this chart is per kilogram
[19:57.420 --> 20:01.660]  It's a different chart everything shifted if this chart is
[20:02.540 --> 20:04.540]  saturation vapor pressure
[20:04.940 --> 20:06.940]  And you divide by pressure
[20:07.060 --> 20:12.220]  It's then it's the same chart. You don't need charts for elevation. They only differ when you have
[20:12.860 --> 20:15.420]  amount of water per weight of air
[20:16.260 --> 20:17.780]  not per
[20:17.780 --> 20:19.780]  volume of air
[20:19.820 --> 20:25.900]  You could see when the when the pressure is less that the air dilutes and it's the same amount of water.
[20:25.900 --> 20:27.900]  So
[20:27.900 --> 20:35.020]  That's why we simplify that whole chart to just do that saturation vapor pressure curve
[20:37.820 --> 20:39.820]  Now I want to talk about
[20:41.060 --> 20:43.060]  in closing
[20:44.460 --> 20:47.660]  Implementation of all of these principles we've been talking about in
[20:48.340 --> 20:50.340]  What's called the Penman-Monteith equation?
[20:51.340 --> 20:58.980]  We use this equation all the time to calculate evapotranspiration
[21:00.700 --> 21:07.140]  And I'm going to show you the equation and say how do these principles go into this equation to do this
[21:08.460 --> 21:09.940]  perhaps the
[21:09.940 --> 21:13.500]  best book for this is this book called
[21:14.700 --> 21:16.700]  Food and Agriculture
[21:16.820 --> 21:19.020]  Organization FAO 56
[21:20.020 --> 21:24.540]  Crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water
[21:25.340 --> 21:27.340]  requirements, so this is full of
[21:28.020 --> 21:31.660]  Step by step implementation of these principles. I can probably put this
[21:32.580 --> 21:34.580]  right here
[21:34.580 --> 21:37.140]  And it occurs to me that with this thing
[21:37.140 --> 21:44.540]  I could just open the pages and and show the pages instead I made some I copied some of the key graphs out of this
[21:46.700 --> 21:48.340]  Yes
[21:48.380 --> 21:55.260]  That this thank you and this the question is there's a website for this and and you can get the whole book on the web
[21:55.260 --> 22:01.100]  I think the book of paper copy costs quite a bit, but the website's free and yeah
[22:02.540 --> 22:04.540]  so
[22:04.940 --> 22:06.940]  Let's
[22:07.900 --> 22:09.900]  Jump right here to
[22:14.260 --> 22:16.260]  The Penman-Monteith
[22:19.340 --> 22:25.140]  Here it is I have to fold this to make it fit
[22:27.380 --> 22:29.540]  And I'm gonna zoom in just a bit
[22:32.500 --> 22:34.500]  So now we can I
[22:36.860 --> 22:39.580]  Could probably zoom in even more get this big
[22:41.260 --> 22:43.260]  So here's the Penman-Monteith
[22:43.980 --> 22:50.380]  Now this varies the coefficients vary depending on the units everything has units and
[22:51.100 --> 22:57.780]  In a rough sense if we took all these energy balance principles and rearrange the equation
[22:58.460 --> 23:00.460]  They would have a lot of
[23:00.620 --> 23:05.340]  Coefficients like this, but let's look at the difference so first of all this is with the units in here
[23:06.220 --> 23:08.220]  reference evapotranspiration
[23:08.260 --> 23:12.460]  Now what this means is the maximum you could get for the conditions
[23:12.860 --> 23:17.100]  In millimeters a day, so you could do that with this
[23:17.780 --> 23:20.700]  Then look at the next components net radiation
[23:21.500 --> 23:24.700]  Minus soil heat flux now we didn't put soil heat flux in here
[23:24.700 --> 23:30.620]  But it wouldn't be hard we could just say sums disappearing in the ground and sums coming back out of the ground
[23:31.340 --> 23:33.340]  So there's net radiation
[23:33.380 --> 23:36.420]  right front and center in this equation
[23:37.900 --> 23:41.360]  Then we go air temperature. That's let's jump to
[23:43.140 --> 23:47.180]  E-saturation minus E air so there's our leaf to air
[23:48.220 --> 23:54.260]  difference in this equation the rest of these coefficients without going into this in detail are
[23:55.140 --> 23:57.140]  units conversion to
[23:57.700 --> 24:00.220]  get this to net radiation and
[24:02.460 --> 24:09.820]  Resistance to water flow here's another key thing that people don't think about in this
[24:10.340 --> 24:15.140]  U is wind speed that's a universal symbol for wind speed
[24:16.220 --> 24:18.220]  This is in the numerator
[24:18.220 --> 24:20.660]  This is in the numerator as these get bigger
[24:21.140 --> 24:26.100]  Transpiration gets bigger look at wind speed. It's in both the numerator and the denominator
[24:27.180 --> 24:34.420]  Of this now we have wind speed is just up here. How's wind speed in the numerator and denominator?
[24:34.740 --> 24:36.740]  If
[24:37.060 --> 24:39.300]  You ask the question does wind
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.220]  increase
[24:41.220 --> 24:45.100]  Transpiration does wind increase transpiration true or false
[24:47.500 --> 24:49.500]  It depends
[24:51.220 --> 24:53.220]  There could be no change to
[24:53.500 --> 24:56.380]  That's a tricky question and in fact it turns out
[24:56.380 --> 25:03.140]  I've heard this was a part of a law case once with somebody suing somebody else over water rights and the wind
[25:05.300 --> 25:12.500]  If the leaf is already well watered and it's close to air temperature
[25:13.620 --> 25:15.620]  the wind will
[25:15.740 --> 25:19.980]  And it or if it's especially below air temperature the wind will definitely increase
[25:20.660 --> 25:26.060]  Transpiration by a lot because it's warm and the wind warms the leaf up because it's below air temperature
[25:26.780 --> 25:34.100]  And most of the time when we use this it's for well watered crops, and then wind does increase it, but now imagine
[25:34.500 --> 25:36.500]  a
[25:36.500 --> 25:43.180]  Cactus or some plant that's water stressed the leaves are 10 degrees C above air temperature
[25:43.820 --> 25:45.140]  transpirations
[25:45.140 --> 25:47.060]  minimal
[25:47.060 --> 25:52.220]  But the wind starts to blow the leaves cool off. There's a case where the wind could decrease
[25:52.900 --> 25:58.500]  Transpiration if the plants water stressed and and the wind helps cool the leaves down
[25:58.580 --> 26:03.340]  That's an exception, but it could happen and in intermediate cases
[26:03.340 --> 26:06.340]  You can kind of see that from here with a numerator and denominator
[26:07.140 --> 26:11.260]  Wind doesn't have as big of an effect on transpiration as most people think
[26:12.580 --> 26:15.420]  It it cools our skin
[26:15.900 --> 26:22.620]  Well, we're benefiting from both of these when when we're out, and we're hot and the wind breeze blows we cool off
[26:23.100 --> 26:27.100]  But in the case of water, we're only we're only worried about this
[26:27.260 --> 26:29.260]  So this book
[26:29.500 --> 26:31.500]  FAO 56
[26:32.100 --> 26:33.740]  includes
[26:33.740 --> 26:39.660]  this nice graph here figure 10 effective wind speed on this and
[26:41.060 --> 26:43.620]  Here's increasing wind speeds hot and dry
[26:44.140 --> 26:47.140]  It's helping but as it gets more humid
[26:47.540 --> 26:53.980]  That the effect here's a effective example of no effect of all and even this effect is not all that great
[26:53.980 --> 26:56.220]  This is not a real steep line
[26:57.420 --> 27:03.740]  So this is because wind affects it can cool off the leaves significantly
[27:07.020 --> 27:08.900]  This
[27:08.900 --> 27:11.300]  another useful figure from this
[27:12.340 --> 27:14.340]  here is an
[27:15.060 --> 27:17.060]  example of these components
[27:17.940 --> 27:19.940]  through the day
[27:20.620 --> 27:22.620]  We just talk about
[27:22.860 --> 27:25.340]  calculate examples right here at noon
[27:26.060 --> 27:27.180]  But
[27:27.180 --> 27:29.180]  Here's our evapotranspiration
[27:29.300 --> 27:31.780]  They show lambda for that symbol
[27:32.100 --> 27:39.660]  H is conduction and convection H is a common symbol for that and G is storage in the ground
[27:40.340 --> 27:46.340]  But there's the total and it's partitioned roughly equally into the two parts in this particular example
[27:46.740 --> 27:48.740]  Et was more than this
[27:49.260 --> 27:51.820]  In the mornings when it's cool
[27:52.820 --> 27:55.700]  Et can equal net radiation and then finally
[27:56.340 --> 28:00.820]  Transpiration can't keep up and then sense of then the leaves start to warm up
[28:02.100 --> 28:09.580]  But you can imagine scenarios like this where these the partitioning of these changes all over the place depending on water of the plants
[28:09.580 --> 28:12.740]  But it's a nice diagram of how that changes through the day
[28:13.660 --> 28:15.660]  so
[28:23.180 --> 28:25.180]  We
[28:25.500 --> 28:31.860]  Another important aspect of this that is often overlooked
[28:34.180 --> 28:36.180]  This calculates
[28:37.500 --> 28:40.700]  Et but now we have a
[28:42.380 --> 28:47.740]  Coefficient with this and as we've run these equations, it's et
[28:49.180 --> 28:55.100]  Zero or or o et o and o you can think about as optimum
[28:55.180 --> 28:58.140]  this is the maximum that could run and
[28:58.900 --> 29:05.580]  Everybody runs this equation and they calculate the maximum and they think that's what they got to irrigate with and that's the maximum
[29:05.580 --> 29:07.700]  Not the not the typical
[29:08.380 --> 29:12.860]  So we have all those components that we just showed in this
[29:13.660 --> 29:21.380]  Big honking equation measure with great precision with all of our instruments to get the inputs just right in this
[29:21.980 --> 29:23.980]  and then
[29:24.060 --> 29:26.060]  To estimate actual
[29:26.620 --> 29:28.620]  we multiply this by
[29:29.300 --> 29:35.820]  K and a lot of times it's shown as KC. That's a crop coefficient and it
[29:37.020 --> 29:42.140]  Changes with the amount of ground cover when the plants are little there's not much evapotranspiration
[29:42.460 --> 29:44.460]  They fill in this goes up
[29:44.700 --> 29:51.220]  So this and this number varies from zero and I've seen it as high as one point two
[29:51.340 --> 29:53.340]  And actually can go above one
[29:53.580 --> 30:00.780]  Which says something about whether this is really the optimal because the crop coefficient is even higher than the optimal
[30:02.300 --> 30:09.180]  This is a very coarse estimate of the water so even if we get this
[30:10.020 --> 30:14.220]  To three significant digits with the most precise instruments ever
[30:14.580 --> 30:20.100]  We got to multiply it by this which at best is plus or minus 10 percent maybe 20 percent
[30:20.220 --> 30:22.220]  So this and then this
[30:22.580 --> 30:24.100]  equals
[30:24.100 --> 30:26.100]  ET of
[30:26.100 --> 30:30.740]  the C of the crop of the actual crop
[30:31.940 --> 30:33.540]  and
[30:33.540 --> 30:35.380]  Not many people think about this
[30:35.380 --> 30:42.700]  we take a number that we're trying to get super precise and we multiply it by really kind of a ballpark estimate and
[30:43.100 --> 30:46.460]  That leads to a lot of people really over irrigating
[30:47.220 --> 30:49.220]  in the implementation of this
[30:50.780 --> 30:52.780]  This is
[30:53.140 --> 30:56.900]  This is a here's a diagram of that in this book of the
[30:57.780 --> 31:03.180]  Reference crop ETO and then you multiply by this factor to get ET of the crop
[31:04.740 --> 31:06.660]  And then
[31:06.660 --> 31:12.540]  Because plants aren't always well watered even with all of this. This is still for well watered then we try
[31:14.460 --> 31:17.740]  Might show this down here back out just a bit
[31:18.500 --> 31:24.300]  Then we try to put an adjustment factor in here for how water stress they are
[31:24.500 --> 31:29.220]  So we have two fudge factors on this precisely measured ET
[31:29.420 --> 31:36.300]  The crop coefficient and then the what this is really a water stress coefficient and we get the crop coefficient adjusted
[31:36.300 --> 31:38.780]  Oh boy by the time we get to this one
[31:39.620 --> 31:47.020]  Where it's kind of like spray and pray you're hoping you got it in the ballpark for irrigation and meanwhile. We're running out of water so
[31:48.740 --> 31:52.980]  There's there's a lot of potential to calculate water I
[31:55.780 --> 31:58.140]  Want to talk about another technique of
[32:00.620 --> 32:02.140]  Calculating this
[32:02.140 --> 32:03.500]  that
[32:03.500 --> 32:10.220]  Well first of all there are at least 20 equations in the literature for calculating
[32:10.820 --> 32:12.620]  evapotranspiration
[32:12.660 --> 32:18.020]  From weather variables all over the place and they're in there in this they discussed in this book
[32:19.140 --> 32:21.140]  Blaney Criddle
[32:21.140 --> 32:22.220]  I
[32:22.220 --> 32:26.340]  Forgotten all the names, but many many people have worked on this
[32:27.420 --> 32:32.060]  This is becoming the standard because our weather stations are getting better
[32:32.060 --> 32:37.620]  And we have instruments to measure all the parameters to do this and it is the most
[32:38.180 --> 32:42.980]  Biophysical it's based on physical principles, so we've come to trust this
[32:43.940 --> 32:47.220]  But it lots of people don't have all the instruments to
[32:47.740 --> 32:49.740]  Measure the inputs to this
[32:49.940 --> 32:55.180]  So what are they going to do and what did they do before the Penman Monteith was?
[32:55.740 --> 32:57.740]  was usable
[32:57.780 --> 32:59.540]  here's a
[32:59.540 --> 33:01.540]  one page handout
[33:01.700 --> 33:03.700]  We keep two pages
[33:05.380 --> 33:07.380]  That
[33:07.900 --> 33:09.900]  Wrote this for the
[33:09.900 --> 33:15.500]  Was some of the introduction to this Utah climate book about ways to do ET
[33:16.780 --> 33:21.380]  And I'm it's a hopefully easy to read, but it shows
[33:22.220 --> 33:28.780]  More than 20 equations have been developed to do this. Here's the potential it summarizes all this stuff, then we get to this
[33:29.420 --> 33:31.420]  the Hargraves equation
[33:32.340 --> 33:36.260]  George Hargraves was on the faculty here at Utah State University
[33:36.660 --> 33:40.020]  And of the 20 equations I
[33:40.740 --> 33:43.540]  Would say next to the Penman Monteith
[33:44.300 --> 33:50.060]  His is one of the best it works the best and it is way simpler
[33:50.620 --> 33:52.740]  Than the Penman Monteith to run
[33:53.340 --> 33:55.340]  Here's the equation
[33:55.340 --> 34:01.340]  And I've been told this story by Rick Allen who was on the faculty who has written much
[34:02.820 --> 34:04.820]  He is a
[34:05.140 --> 34:08.180]  Award-winning paper called a Penman for all seasons
[34:08.180 --> 34:15.260]  And it's about the use of the Penman Monteith equation in all conditions all around the world and Rick tells me even
[34:15.460 --> 34:19.860]  He and Hargraves died about two years ago. He lived here in Logan
[34:20.420 --> 34:23.620]  he said Hargraves would come in his office and the
[34:24.540 --> 34:28.420]  Models didn't match the measurements and and he'd say yeah
[34:28.420 --> 34:33.740]  And the two models wouldn't agree that Hargraves and the Penman Monteith and he'd say yeah
[34:33.740 --> 34:37.620]  Well, that's because your model is too complicated and you're gonna get bad data in it
[34:37.620 --> 34:43.740]  And if you just use my model, it's simple and it works and it does work for a wide range of conditions
[34:43.740 --> 34:45.740]  And look at the inputs to this
[34:45.940 --> 34:47.700]  min and max
[34:47.700 --> 34:49.060]  temperature
[34:49.060 --> 34:55.620]  Wow, this was from the days when there were no data loggers. We just had min max thermometers. That was it
[34:55.820 --> 34:57.820]  that's all we had to go on and
[34:58.660 --> 35:02.100]  his his brilliance in developing this was
[35:03.020 --> 35:09.740]  To empirically correlate min and max temperature with pan evaporation and
[35:11.540 --> 35:17.860]  He's got mean right here, but that was the mean was in between min and max so he still had min and max
[35:18.660 --> 35:21.700]  This is the point of five. This is the square root
[35:22.700 --> 35:28.580]  RA you say oh we had to do net radiation. No, I didn't he calculated it based on
[35:29.500 --> 35:31.500]  Radiation above the Earth's atmosphere
[35:31.660 --> 35:33.900]  That was a completely a model based on
[35:34.500 --> 35:37.620]  Latitude he didn't have to measure net radiation. He
[35:38.820 --> 35:46.020]  calculated it from the time of year and the Sun above the atmosphere and then here's a coefficient and
[35:47.060 --> 35:49.060]  This equation for ETO
[35:49.780 --> 35:51.780]  Works remarkably well
[35:51.980 --> 35:53.980]  And it's way
[35:54.500 --> 36:00.860]  Simpler but we we don't use it much anymore because we've got lots of instruments and we can use them far more complex
[36:01.220 --> 36:06.500]  Penman Monteith when you get into the literature on this and you turn the page
[36:09.140 --> 36:16.940]  This is with my colleague Larry hips talking about this this Hargraves tends to under predict under high wind
[36:17.100 --> 36:18.660]  conditions and
[36:18.660 --> 36:21.300]  over-predict in high relative humidity
[36:21.620 --> 36:26.460]  So it's not perfect and then when it gets to minus 17.8 C
[36:26.460 --> 36:33.080]  It goes nuts because it values go negative, but you're not too worried about that because those are super cold days
[36:33.420 --> 36:38.460]  it's it's made for the summer, but I show this just because it's a it's a
[36:39.260 --> 36:43.140]  Brilliant empirical equation then does a pretty good job
[36:43.860 --> 36:46.500]  matching the evapotranspiration data
[36:54.170 --> 36:56.890]  I'm going to close with this picture
[36:58.770 --> 37:00.970]  As we work and work and work to
[37:01.850 --> 37:03.850]  model this and calculate it
[37:04.690 --> 37:07.490]  we keep going back to lysimeters a
[37:08.610 --> 37:14.170]  Big container that we can weigh water is heavy we can accurately measure
[37:15.330 --> 37:16.410]  transpiration
[37:16.410 --> 37:23.230]  Use by weight, but you have to contain the plants in something you can weigh and all of a sudden you're into
[37:23.550 --> 37:29.390]  Ten twenty thousand dollars per container in the field to set up a system to weigh the plants
[37:29.710 --> 37:34.990]  So this is a system in our and the research greenhouses that my students
[37:34.990 --> 37:38.070]  And I built and each one of these has a load cell
[37:38.470 --> 37:44.510]  Underneath it and here's some corn plants in a bucket to get evaporation low we covered them with tinfoil
[37:44.990 --> 37:48.270]  But we can do various levels of water stress in here
[37:49.030 --> 37:55.670]  Using lysimeters and look at these principles and see how well they apply to different kinds of plants
[37:55.750 --> 38:01.990]  We can do precision water stress with this because we can bring them down to a low weight and keep them there
[38:01.990 --> 38:06.590]  Just water enough to keep them there. We can tell it well how well water stress
[38:06.590 --> 38:10.750]  They are we can determine obviously hourly transpiration rates with this
[38:11.390 --> 38:17.430]  This is all hooked up to multiplexers and Campbell scientific data loggers to and that we watch them
[38:18.310 --> 38:21.110]  Transpire on the screen. This has been a really useful
[38:21.950 --> 38:26.910]  Technique of course it constrains the roots, so there's our big interacting factor
[38:26.910 --> 38:32.710]  What would they do in the field if they had more roots and we can get bigger lysimeters we can get bigger load cells
[38:33.230 --> 38:35.230]  but they
[38:35.630 --> 38:42.350]  Don't have the precision so it's all then you can't have as many replicates if you have big load cells
[38:43.510 --> 38:44.550]  so
[38:44.550 --> 38:46.550]  mark question
[38:47.430 --> 38:49.430]  in the class
[38:49.790 --> 38:56.070]  We have a photosynthesis term in the energy balance, but because photosynthesis is small and a lot of our
[38:57.990 --> 38:59.990]  Equations are approximation
[39:00.750 --> 39:02.750]  some photosynthesis manageable
[39:03.430 --> 39:09.150]  This application however you have high precision instruments to very accurately weigh the water
[39:10.350 --> 39:12.350]  You know exactly what?
[39:13.150 --> 39:18.710]  What water loss is but there's going to be a mass gain because of carbon, right?
[39:19.190 --> 39:21.110]  Yes
[39:21.110 --> 39:22.510]  Yes
[39:22.510 --> 39:24.510]  Now we're into the details
[39:24.910 --> 39:26.790]  so
[39:26.790 --> 39:28.790]  the the question is
[39:29.070 --> 39:33.670]  The weight of this will change because the plants are getting bigger and not just the dry weight
[39:33.670 --> 39:36.190]  But the fresh weight of the plants are getting bigger
[39:36.190 --> 39:42.470]  And we do worry about that and in some cases we calculate it out in most cases we calculate it out
[39:43.070 --> 39:49.270]  But this brings up a really interesting opportunity to make a point you would think wow aren't you using this to measure the size of?
[39:49.270 --> 39:51.270]  The plants and not no
[39:51.790 --> 39:53.790]  It's the amount of water in the soil
[39:54.310 --> 40:00.590]  Because the weight of the water down here is several orders of magnitude greater than the fresh weight of the plants
[40:01.470 --> 40:03.470]  and
[40:03.590 --> 40:06.710]  The water use efficiency of these plants
[40:07.270 --> 40:12.950]  Might be one gram of dry weight per thousand grams of water transpired
[40:13.750 --> 40:19.270]  So that says something about and it might be 10 grams of fresh weight per thousand grams of water
[40:19.950 --> 40:21.230]  but the
[40:21.230 --> 40:28.110]  water transpiration and the water flux through this is at least a hundred times bigger than the fresh weight gain and
[40:28.910 --> 40:36.230]  We back calculate the fresh weight gain by the water lost if we've transpired 100 grams of water then
[40:37.510 --> 40:43.830]  0.3 grams of fresh weight is added to the system, so it does matter, but it's small
[40:46.070 --> 40:53.030]  Because of the poor water use efficiency because if water is fluxing through those and the fresh weight gains tiny
[40:58.110 --> 41:00.110]  10 grams of carbon 10 grams
[41:03.270 --> 41:07.470]  Thousand water that's 1% right yes
[41:20.670 --> 41:22.670]  Yes
[41:23.670 --> 41:25.670]  This
[41:27.150 --> 41:28.350]  So
[41:28.350 --> 41:34.870]  1 to 100 it might be fresh weight, but photosynthesis makes dry weight, and that's more like 1 to a thousand
[41:35.830 --> 41:40.830]  You know thousand grams of water lost and 1 gram of dry weight showing up
[41:41.790 --> 41:43.790]  which kind of
[41:43.830 --> 41:45.830]  it's small and
[41:47.590 --> 41:49.590]  Depending on the model
[41:50.590 --> 41:52.510]  It
[41:52.510 --> 41:57.310]  Photosynthesis can be 5% and so now if we're really tweaking this model
[41:57.550 --> 42:02.910]  We can start to put coefficients in for this, but this leads to a larger issue with models
[42:05.270 --> 42:07.270]  At least in my experience
[42:07.550 --> 42:14.110]  We start putting more coefficients into this thing and we forget about the importance of the two big things
[42:14.110 --> 42:19.510]  I love simple models you get the relationships right in your head, and you start to think about it
[42:19.990 --> 42:22.510]  And then we start to add more coefficients
[42:22.510 --> 42:28.230]  and the tendency is to think we've made a better model because we have 14 coefficients instead of two and
[42:28.630 --> 42:33.270]  it gets in the way of people's thinking to have extra coefficients and
[42:33.710 --> 42:34.990]  they're
[42:34.990 --> 42:37.190]  In many cases they don't add
[42:38.110 --> 42:42.950]  they don't fundamentally add to the precision of the model this is obviously a
[42:43.590 --> 42:44.670]  a
[42:44.670 --> 42:50.030]  Big discussion among lots of people is how many coefficients to put and how many are useful?
[42:50.030 --> 42:54.470]  I think it's analogous to how many significant digits you show in a spreadsheet
[42:55.230 --> 42:56.110]  Well great
[42:56.110 --> 43:03.230]  We can calculate a spreadsheet and Excel puts six six or eight significant digits on every number and now you're scanning that
[43:03.630 --> 43:05.830]  spreadsheet looking for patterns in the data and
[43:06.190 --> 43:13.470]  All those extra digits are just noise and they they block our ability to see the big picture patterns
[43:14.710 --> 43:19.110]  these are all sidebars related to your question, but but
[43:21.430 --> 43:23.970]  Photosynthesis is in some of the models
[43:24.470 --> 43:29.150]  And for sure when you apply this to soils now the now you'd have storage
[43:29.190 --> 43:34.470]  we didn't talk about storage at all, but the book goes into storage quite a bit and
[43:35.470 --> 43:42.630]  That's a whole nother subject for getting that storage component right which is why we have heat flux sensors in the soil to try and
[43:42.790 --> 43:48.030]  measure that and it's hard to measure so we model back and forth measure and model and
[43:48.950 --> 43:50.950]  Hope we got that part of it, right?
[43:55.650 --> 43:57.650]  So I'll end there
[43:58.530 --> 44:05.690]  You've been a great audience. Thank you for coming to these lectures and hopefully you find places to apply this stuff
[44:07.210 --> 44:09.210]  Thank you
