[00:00.000 --> 00:07.760]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments and professor at Utah State University.
[00:07.760 --> 00:13.640]  We're honored today to have my colleague, my long-term colleague, Mark Van Ersel, here
[00:13.640 --> 00:20.680]  with us at the Apogee Recording Studio, both to visit at my laboratory at the university
[00:20.680 --> 00:28.880]  to talk about science, but also to talk about commercial implications of all that science.
[00:28.880 --> 00:35.480]  Mark and I have been colleagues for many, many years, many decades even, and we've shared
[00:35.480 --> 00:36.880]  students back and forth.
[00:36.880 --> 00:40.480]  It's been a wonderful collaboration.
[00:40.480 --> 00:47.240]  The thing we want to talk about today is exemplified here on the board, what we call precision
[00:47.240 --> 00:49.800]  photon delivery.
[00:49.800 --> 00:57.680]  So now that we live in an era with LEDs, wow, they give us unprecedented ability to control
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.640]  the delivery of photons, and not just focused photons, but changes in timing of the photon
[01:03.640 --> 01:05.120]  delivery.
[01:05.120 --> 01:11.920]  So in this case, when we say precision delivery, today we're going to mostly talk about precision
[01:11.920 --> 01:15.880]  delivery in time of these photons.
[01:15.880 --> 01:24.200]  So Mark, do you want to start by—how has your university research informed this, and
[01:24.200 --> 01:26.200]  how has that led to your—?
[01:26.200 --> 01:33.960]  Mark has a company called Candidas that makes software and hardware to achieve precision
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.080]  photon delivery, so he's right in the middle of all of this.
[01:38.080 --> 01:42.880]  But do you want to comment on how your university research has informed all this?
[01:42.880 --> 01:46.600]  Yeah, absolutely, and thank you for having me today, Bruce.
[01:46.600 --> 01:54.920]  So I started working on lighting research about eight years ago, and when I decided
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.760]  to do so, what I identified as a niche that nobody else seemed to be paying attention
[01:59.760 --> 02:07.000]  to was, how can we actually control LED light fixtures very precisely to give plants the
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.960]  amount of light that they need at the time that they need it and can use it most efficiently?
[02:12.960 --> 02:14.880]  So that's how we started out.
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.800]  Since then, we have gotten a big USDA grant where we are collaborating with Bruce's Utah
[02:19.800 --> 02:25.560]  State University lab, but we're also collaborating with fantastic electrical engineers and people
[02:25.560 --> 02:30.920]  in energy informatics who have helped me see the bigger picture of how you can actually
[02:30.920 --> 02:36.200]  do this, how you can optimize lighting, and how this can impact society at large, which
[02:36.200 --> 02:39.600]  ultimately makes all of this work much more exciting.
[02:39.600 --> 02:44.480]  So it's been a fascinating evolution over the past eight years where I've learned lots
[02:44.480 --> 02:48.760]  of things from working with lots of people who know things that I do not.
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.640]  It's been great.
[02:51.640 --> 02:59.880]  Just to elaborate on that for our listeners, it's probably close to five years ago now,
[02:59.880 --> 03:11.080]  we've collaborated on a large grant to the USDA to look at optimizing lighting.
[03:11.080 --> 03:16.680]  And this lamp, this project came to be called the Lamp Project, and I think you're the one
[03:16.680 --> 03:25.080]  that coined that phrase, L-A-M-P, Lighting Approaches to Maximize Profits.
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.200]  And of course, the USDA is very interested in optimizing this, and the whole thing is
[03:31.200 --> 03:32.400]  lighting approaches.
[03:32.400 --> 03:40.760]  So now with USDA funds and collaboration of multiple laboratories, we've done a lot with this.
[03:41.760 --> 03:44.040]  Yeah, it's been a great project.
[03:44.080 --> 03:47.920]  So it's not just plant scientists that are involved.
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.880]  So I think the key word actually in the title of the project is profits.
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.040]  And when we think profits, we have to think economics, because Bruce and I typically really
[03:58.040 --> 03:59.560]  tend to focus on the plants.
[03:59.560 --> 04:01.360]  How do we grow plants?
[04:01.360 --> 04:03.160]  And that's really fascinating stuff.
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.720]  But if we don't take into account the cost associated with that, then ultimately we're
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.080]  not serving the controlled environment agriculture industry, plant factories and greenhouses,
[04:14.080 --> 04:15.600]  in the way that we need to.
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.680]  Because yes, they need to grow plants, but more than that, what they have to do is be
[04:19.680 --> 04:23.560]  as profitable as they can be.
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.760]  And that has really required this interdisciplinary work to get these different perspectives on
[04:28.760 --> 04:33.360]  how we can do things beyond just plant science and horticulture.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.080]  Yeah, and this Grant Rial joke, because the currency for us as professors is a bunch of
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.920]  referee journal articles, which as you know, can be pretty egghead journal articles.
[04:45.920 --> 04:50.160]  The USDA doesn't want to see a bunch of egghead referee journal articles.
[04:50.160 --> 04:52.400]  They want to see boots on the ground.
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.400]  They want to see how all of this work is going to help growers.
[04:56.400 --> 05:01.920]  Yeah, and that is actually where my company can also play an important role.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.120]  So as academics, we can develop all these methods.
[05:05.120 --> 05:11.160]  We try them on a relatively small scale, but as academics, we have relatively little incentive
[05:11.160 --> 05:18.080]  from our institutions to try to make sure that these new technologies actually get implemented
[05:18.080 --> 05:21.040]  at scale throughout the industry.
[05:21.040 --> 05:25.400]  But so as candidates, we are very focused, of course, in making sure that we get this
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.280]  technology into commercial facilities.
[05:28.320 --> 05:33.160]  And we have an additional project with a different branch of the USDA, the National Resources
[05:33.160 --> 05:39.600]  Conservation Service, where candidates work with them on not just showing that we can
[05:39.600 --> 05:46.320]  achieve significant energy reductions through better lighting control methods, but what
[05:46.320 --> 05:52.440]  we really are focused on there in the long term is to develop guidelines to inventive
[05:53.080 --> 05:59.920]  to develop incentive or rebate programs for the industry to help them get this technology
[05:59.920 --> 06:01.880]  into their greenhouses.
[06:01.880 --> 06:07.040]  And so I think that is a really exciting long term thing because those incentive programs
[06:07.040 --> 06:10.800]  are going to really help make this technology accessible.
[06:10.800 --> 06:15.960]  And certain utility companies, especially in the northeast of the US, are already providing
[06:15.960 --> 06:21.240]  rebates, not just for better lights, but for better lighting control systems.
[06:21.240 --> 06:26.400]  So we really see this movement happening, and that's a great impact of Project LAMP.
[06:26.400 --> 06:34.800]  And I think most people know now that every passing year, there are fewer and fewer high
[06:34.800 --> 06:43.440]  pressure sodium lamps used and more and more LEDs used as the LEDs get both more reliable
[06:43.440 --> 06:46.120]  and more cost effective.
[06:46.120 --> 06:51.840]  And of course, it's a nice synergism between us because first of all, you got to precisely
[06:51.840 --> 06:57.720]  measure the photons and then you use the software to figure out how to deliver the photons.
[06:57.720 --> 07:04.280]  Yeah, and the change from high pressure sodium fixtures to LED fixtures is really important
[07:04.280 --> 07:06.560]  when you think about controlling lighting.
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.000]  With high pressure sodium, maybe you have some ability to dim them depending on what
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.080]  fixtures you're using.
[07:13.080 --> 07:17.680]  But once they take some time to heat up and give you full light output, once you turn
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.520]  them off, they need time to cool down before you can turn them back on.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.760]  So you can't get real precise control over how much supplemental light you're providing
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.520]  in the greenhouse.
[07:28.520 --> 07:35.200]  With LED fixtures, almost all of those are fully dimmable at this point in time.
[07:35.200 --> 07:41.880]  And that dimmability allows us to very precisely control exactly how much supplemental light
[07:41.880 --> 07:48.780]  we provide in response to how much sunlight is available at that particular point in time.
[07:48.780 --> 07:55.640]  So LEDs have really opened up a whole new area to make this lighting control much more
[07:55.640 --> 07:58.280]  beneficial for the industry.
[07:58.280 --> 08:03.520]  Yeah, all of us at our research greenhouses, we're pushing the envelope with high pressure
[08:03.520 --> 08:08.880]  sodium, trying to cycle them faster to get this variable control.
[08:08.880 --> 08:13.800]  And we burned up a lot of capacitors and a lot of high pressure sodium lights, trying
[08:13.800 --> 08:16.320]  to push them to the edge.
[08:16.320 --> 08:21.360]  And that was expensive, having to rebuild these lights all the time.
[08:21.360 --> 08:26.000]  So this is something that people don't think about much with LEDs.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.080]  They think, OK, great, they're more efficient.
[08:28.080 --> 08:31.540]  But man, they're so much more controllable.
[08:31.560 --> 08:34.980]  We're just on the threshold of taking advantage of that.
[08:34.980 --> 08:37.700]  Yeah, I really think that it is the next frontier.
[08:37.700 --> 08:43.140]  And when I would talk to the industry about this topic two or three years ago, people
[08:43.140 --> 08:46.860]  would go, that's pretty interesting, never thought about this.
[08:46.860 --> 08:52.480]  But I was at a trade show just two months ago, and it's really satisfying to see that
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.300]  we have to explain much less what we're doing, because people are getting the concept.
[08:57.340 --> 09:03.500]  And I think when it comes to lighting, control of how many photons we deliver when is really
[09:03.500 --> 09:04.500]  the next frontier.
[09:04.500 --> 09:09.300]  LED fixtures are great, but they're starting to push to the theoretical limit of how good
[09:09.300 --> 09:10.620]  they can be.
[09:10.620 --> 09:16.260]  And advances in the efficacy of LED fixtures, they're going to slow down.
[09:16.260 --> 09:22.460]  But we can still make big improvements on actually how we use those fixtures in commercial
[09:22.460 --> 09:25.900]  facilities and in research facilities as well.
[09:25.900 --> 09:31.260]  An analogy, I guess as teachers we're always trying to think of analogies that help explain
[09:31.260 --> 09:32.260]  things.
[09:32.260 --> 09:37.780]  But an analogy for me is being like a high performance athlete, where when you eat and
[09:37.780 --> 09:41.780]  what you eat makes a big difference in your performance.
[09:41.780 --> 09:47.820]  And here with HBS, well, you can have a steak dinner or not a steak dinner.
[09:47.820 --> 09:54.660]  And now we could have almost the equivalent of precision intravenous feeding to deliver
[09:54.700 --> 09:58.540]  the photons at just the right time for maximum performance.
[09:58.540 --> 10:01.140]  Yeah, and that's absolutely correct.
[10:01.140 --> 10:05.740]  There are really good quantum sensors available, of course, including from Apogee.
[10:05.740 --> 10:11.140]  That information is really critical, but you can interface those with really cheap microcomputers
[10:11.140 --> 10:17.860]  that can take those readings, apply really advanced algorithms to that real-time data
[10:17.860 --> 10:23.580]  that feeds in, and then those microcomputers can send the signal back to the light fixtures
[10:23.700 --> 10:27.380]  and tell those light fixtures exactly what they need to do.
[10:27.380 --> 10:32.780]  And at Candidas, we tell light fixtures every 15 seconds what change we want to make to
[10:32.780 --> 10:37.740]  make sure that by the end of the day or by the end of the growing cycle, that crop has
[10:37.740 --> 10:46.260]  received just enough light to grow exactly how it needs to grow, but without providing
[10:46.260 --> 10:49.580]  more light than is really required.
[10:49.580 --> 10:54.620]  And that excess light that is often provided in greenhouses is really expensive, and in
[10:54.620 --> 10:59.860]  some cases, I think, that can make the difference between a greenhouse being profitable versus
[10:59.860 --> 11:01.340]  losing money.
[11:01.340 --> 11:05.940]  And so we really want to push those facilities towards profitability.
[11:05.940 --> 11:11.420]  It's pretty intuitive that on a partly cloudy day, when the sun comes out, you can turn
[11:11.420 --> 11:14.820]  your lights down because you've got sunlight.
[11:14.820 --> 11:19.300]  But five minutes later, sun goes behind a cloud, and now you need to turn them back
[11:19.300 --> 11:20.300]  up.
[11:20.300 --> 11:25.820]  And of course, this is what we're talking about, that level of controllability.
[11:25.820 --> 11:32.220]  But first of all, Mark just gave an invited talk at a controlled environments conference.
[11:32.220 --> 11:37.340]  It was a conference in Tucson that we both were at.
[11:37.340 --> 11:43.300]  But he gave a talk about this, and I wonder if you could talk about, elaborate a bit more
[11:43.300 --> 11:48.580]  on the variable price of electricity and how that enters into this.
[11:48.580 --> 11:52.220]  Yeah, I think that is a really fascinating topic.
[11:52.220 --> 11:57.980]  And the reason that we are working on this topic at the University of Georgia is because
[11:57.980 --> 12:02.300]  I have colleagues in engineering and energy informatics who understand these things much
[12:02.300 --> 12:04.500]  better than I do.
[12:04.500 --> 12:08.940]  But it seems pretty intuitive that if you have variable electricity prices over the
[12:08.940 --> 12:14.220]  course of a day, you want to provide as much supplemental light as possible during times
[12:14.220 --> 12:19.300]  of the day that that electricity is relatively cheap.
[12:19.300 --> 12:25.700]  And so my colleagues in engineering have developed algorithms that can take advantage of that
[12:25.700 --> 12:27.260]  variable electricity price.
[12:27.260 --> 12:33.700]  And now the goal is no longer to minimize the amount of supplemental light that we provide
[12:33.700 --> 12:37.360]  to meet a crop's need, and that's what I did in the past.
[12:37.360 --> 12:44.160]  We are now able to actually control lights based on how can we minimize the cost of that
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.160]  electricity.
[12:45.160 --> 12:49.440]  And of course, when you think about that from a commercial perspective, that is really what
[12:49.440 --> 12:51.000]  they need to do.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.200]  And so we have developed algorithms that can do this really well.
[12:55.200 --> 13:02.360]  And those algorithms reduce the cost of electricity use by about 35% over less sophisticated methods
[13:02.520 --> 13:07.800]  that are actually probably still better than what is commonly used in the industry.
[13:07.800 --> 13:14.800]  Likewise, at Candidus, we have done a number of trials in commercial greenhouses with our
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.880]  proprietary lighting control approach, and we typically reduce electricity use by about
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.280]  30% without a notable impact on the crop.
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.440]  The plants grow just as well, but that is a lot of money that you end up saving because
[13:30.480 --> 13:37.480]  the cost of providing supplemental light in a greenhouse can easily be $60,000, $70,000
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.240]  per acre over the course of a lettuce growing cycle.
[13:43.240 --> 13:50.240]  So if you can cut that by about a third, that's, in my book, quite a bit of money.
[13:53.880 --> 13:59.640]  Not everybody understands the issues of variable electricity pricing, other than we know they
[13:59.640 --> 14:01.360]  often vary.
[14:01.360 --> 14:08.360]  But when a utility company gets the infrastructure to provide electricity, if they don't use
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.780]  it, it's hard to store electricity.
[14:11.780 --> 14:17.900]  And so they end up purchasing electricity that they can't use certain times of the day.
[14:17.900 --> 14:22.800]  And they would love to have customers use that surplus electricity.
[14:22.800 --> 14:28.080]  And then the opposite, the common thing is late in the afternoon, everybody's air conditioners
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.480]  come on, and now the cost of electricity is just enormous.
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.640]  Well, we could just turn the lights off during those periods of peak demand.
[14:37.640 --> 14:44.400]  So this interface between big greenhouse growers and utility companies has a lot of potential
[14:44.400 --> 14:51.400]  to help the utility companies efficiently utilize their capacity.
[14:52.400 --> 14:58.600]  Yeah, and what we have actually seen in the past weeks in the United States is that people
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.080]  in California have been asked to turn off their air conditioning units or turn up the
[15:03.080 --> 15:06.080]  AC to maybe 78 degrees.
[15:06.080 --> 15:12.360]  Texas has massive problems with their utility network not being able to provide enough power
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.080]  for all of their customers during peak times.
[15:16.160 --> 15:21.800]  So actually at Candidus, we have collaborated quite a bit with utility companies to try
[15:21.800 --> 15:28.800]  to help them shift the electricity use in greenhouses away from those peak hours.
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.220]  And this is a really important topic for utility companies.
[15:33.220 --> 15:38.680]  And that's why I think ultimately, we need to get the controlled environment ag industry
[15:38.680 --> 15:43.800]  hooked up with the utility industry so that we can come up with solutions that are actually
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.960]  beneficial for everybody.
[15:45.960 --> 15:49.560]  And then hopefully we can have a positive impact on society as well.
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.480]  So we're really focused on creating a win-win-win scenario there.
[15:54.480 --> 16:01.120]  So if you tell people, just suffer, turn your AC up, they're not very happy about that.
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.160]  But we don't usually consider the plants get happy or sad.
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.280]  If we just tell them we're going to give you the photons a little later, the plants grow
[16:09.280 --> 16:11.000]  just as well.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.160]  And that's the issue here.
[16:13.360 --> 16:18.600]  That's actually an interesting topic because the conventional wisdom and what we tend to
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.360]  do in controlled environment agriculture is we want to control everything really precisely.
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.760]  I think those of us who are working in controlled environment agriculture, we tend to be, as
[16:28.760 --> 16:31.440]  I like to say, control freaks.
[16:31.440 --> 16:37.280]  But we've actually done quite a bit of research at the university that has shown that plants
[16:37.280 --> 16:41.000]  actually don't really care about that precision control.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.320]  They're perfectly happy if you give them more light now, less light later, maybe more
[16:45.320 --> 16:48.400]  light today, less light tomorrow.
[16:48.400 --> 16:51.680]  And that was, first of all, was really surprising to us.
[16:51.680 --> 16:57.600]  But it was also really exciting because that now allows us to really take advantage of
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.240]  time periods that electricity is relatively cheap.
[17:01.240 --> 17:08.120]  And it's provide a whole new frontier for this precision photon delivery because we
[17:08.440 --> 17:15.080]  don't have to keep the light levels in a greenhouse as stable as we possibly can.
[17:15.080 --> 17:19.280]  So that can be really beneficial for the industry.
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.920]  So just to switch topics a little bit, I want to ask you about how did you choose the name
[17:24.920 --> 17:28.360]  Candidas for your company?
[17:28.360 --> 17:30.080]  People ask me, how did you choose Apogee?
[17:30.080 --> 17:33.320]  Well, it's the point in an orbit farthest from the earth.
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.280]  And I was doing a lot of work with NASA, so that was kind of a no-brainer.
[17:37.440 --> 17:39.360]  Candidas, that's an unusual name.
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.800]  How did you come up with that?
[17:40.800 --> 17:43.360]  It's kind of an interesting and maybe funny story.
[17:43.360 --> 17:50.000]  So my co-founder, Erico Matas, asked me if I was willing to co-found a company with him
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.040]  to work on lighting control systems.
[17:52.040 --> 17:56.200]  And I said, yes, I'd be excited to work on that.
[17:56.200 --> 18:00.360]  And of course, the very first thing we needed to do was figure out, well, what is the name
[18:00.360 --> 18:01.800]  of that company going to be?
[18:01.800 --> 18:06.320]  So I spent an evening on the internet, and I was interested in either Greek or Latin
[18:06.360 --> 18:12.400]  words that had some connection to light, because our focus, of course, is on light.
[18:12.400 --> 18:18.120]  And so I found all kinds of terms, but most of those were already in use by lots of other
[18:18.120 --> 18:19.120]  companies.
[18:19.120 --> 18:28.200]  And I finally came across Candidas, and one of the meanings in Latin is light.
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.560]  But an other meaning that pushed it over the edge is grey-haired.
[18:33.560 --> 18:35.840]  And I said, that's it.
[18:35.840 --> 18:37.080]  That's what we're going with.
[18:37.080 --> 18:38.600]  I sent an email to Erico.
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.120]  I explained it.
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.760]  He laughed at the greet, and here we are.
[18:44.760 --> 18:48.880]  So I'm the official spokesperson for the company.
[18:48.880 --> 18:55.040]  Wise elders helping you better utilize your photons.
[18:56.040 --> 19:03.240]  Well, Mark, it's been a great run that we've had back and forth over the years.
[19:03.240 --> 19:11.680]  And it's so exciting to be working in an area that has both lots of opportunities, profound
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.200]  scientific discoveries, but commercial opportunities, too.
[19:17.200 --> 19:19.680]  They're very synergistic for both of us.
[19:19.680 --> 19:20.680]  Yeah.
[19:21.320 --> 19:25.280]  As you well know, it's really exciting if you can take the work that you do at a university
[19:25.280 --> 19:32.440]  and through a company really help to scale the work that we do in an academic setting.
[19:32.440 --> 19:37.760]  And there are lots of things in my career that have been rewarding.
[19:37.760 --> 19:40.840]  Perhaps the most important thing is all the people that I've worked with, the graduate
[19:40.840 --> 19:42.840]  students that I have trained.
[19:42.840 --> 19:49.320]  But I think now seeing this technology spread through the industry, that is really rewarding
[19:49.320 --> 19:54.120]  in a different way, because I can tell that we're making a positive impact, not just on
[19:54.120 --> 19:58.720]  the industry, but I think we're having a positive impact on society, too.
[19:58.720 --> 20:01.280]  So it's really exciting to be involved.
[20:01.280 --> 20:07.100]  This meeting, it was just last week that we were together in Tucson.
[20:07.100 --> 20:10.280]  It's a controlled environments conference.
[20:10.280 --> 20:16.120]  And when that first started a long time ago, back when we were much younger, it was a bunch
[20:16.120 --> 20:21.320]  of academics sitting around a small table discussing science.
[20:21.320 --> 20:23.480]  And that was the whole meeting.
[20:23.480 --> 20:30.520]  And as the basic science found applications, commercial people started to want to come
[20:30.520 --> 20:31.960]  to the meeting.
[20:31.960 --> 20:34.080]  And sure, come to the meeting.
[20:34.080 --> 20:36.040]  And the group grew.
[20:36.040 --> 20:37.040]  And it grew.
[20:37.040 --> 20:38.040]  And it grew.
[20:38.040 --> 20:40.040]  And the growth chamber people come.
[20:40.040 --> 20:42.920]  Lots of LED people come to this.
[20:42.920 --> 20:45.400]  Instrument companies come to this meeting now.
[20:45.720 --> 20:51.320]  So now we had over 200 people at our last meeting, which started out with a bunch of
[20:51.320 --> 20:57.000]  egghead people discussing some pretty refined points of science.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.640]  It's just a remarkable transformation.
[20:59.640 --> 21:00.640]  Yeah.
[21:00.640 --> 21:05.840]  Well, as you commented on during that meeting, well, you've probably been part of it for
[21:05.840 --> 21:09.040]  about 30, maybe a little bit longer years.
[21:09.040 --> 21:10.360]  Over 30, yeah.
[21:10.400 --> 21:15.280]  And controlled environment was really just a research tool where we could do research
[21:15.280 --> 21:19.120]  that then might or might not have practical applications.
[21:19.120 --> 21:24.280]  A lot of it was pretty basic research that was done in growth chambers, basically.
[21:24.280 --> 21:29.360]  But when you now think about controlled environments, that is a very large controlled environment
[21:29.360 --> 21:32.000]  agriculture industry.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.920]  We have a number of large vertical farms, and they keep growing.
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.960]  And on the greenhouse side, the greenhouse vegetable industry is just exploding.
[21:43.960 --> 21:49.880]  So I think that is, at least to some extent, really a long-term result of the work that
[21:49.880 --> 21:53.280]  people like you were doing 30 years ago already.
[21:53.280 --> 21:59.480]  And now we see a real transformation of how we actually grow vegetables.
[21:59.480 --> 22:03.360]  The earliest stuff was mostly NASA funded.
[22:03.360 --> 22:04.600]  We got NASA funding.
[22:05.360 --> 22:09.000]  NASA can't really have a greenhouse on the moon or Mars.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  There's no atmosphere.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  It has to be pressurized.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.800]  It had meteorites that would break it.
[22:13.800 --> 22:18.440]  NASA has to use electric lights in a closed system.
[22:18.440 --> 22:20.600]  Those were the early days.
[22:20.600 --> 22:26.600]  But boy, as soon as LEDs came along, it just exploded for commercial opportunities.
[22:26.600 --> 22:31.320]  Yeah, although I remember some of the first talks at this very meeting about growing plants
[22:31.320 --> 22:33.320]  on LEDs, and it was really interesting.
[22:33.520 --> 22:38.920]  You saw beautiful pictures, but only NASA could actually afford to buy LEDs because
[22:38.920 --> 22:39.920]  they were so expensive.
[22:39.920 --> 22:46.160]  And quite frankly, they were very, very bad compared to what we have now.
[22:46.160 --> 22:51.000]  And for a long time, I was not convinced that this would be something that would ever become
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.760]  commercially viable.
[22:52.760 --> 22:59.320]  But of course, by now, it has completely changed, and LEDs are really efficient.
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.320]  There's probably never going to be a different kind of light that is going to come along
[23:04.320 --> 23:10.760]  that is going to replace LEDs because LEDs are so good, and they will be the choice for
[23:10.760 --> 23:15.080]  growing plants, whether it's indoors or in greenhouses.
[23:15.080 --> 23:16.080]  Yeah.
[23:16.080 --> 23:22.240]  Well, we talk about this all the time, but if we look at the history of electric lighting,
[23:22.240 --> 23:28.120]  if we go back far enough, it was monks with kerosene lamps walking from room to room.
[23:28.120 --> 23:29.960]  What's the energy efficiency of that?
[23:29.960 --> 23:30.960]  It's teeny.
[23:30.960 --> 23:35.960]  It's tenths of a percent turning energy into light.
[23:35.960 --> 23:40.840]  And then Edison invents the incandescent bulb, and it's a huge breakthrough.
[23:40.840 --> 23:47.000]  And we got up to like 5% efficiency, and at the time, massive breakthrough.
[23:47.000 --> 23:55.960]  Then after World War II, we went to fluorescence, and we got into the 15% efficiency with fluorescent
[23:55.960 --> 23:58.360]  lights, another big breakthrough.
[23:58.360 --> 24:03.780]  Then we went to high-intensity discharge, high-pressure sodium, another big breakthrough.
[24:03.780 --> 24:08.680]  We got into the 30% efficiency of electric lighting, and we thought, oh my God, this
[24:08.680 --> 24:09.680]  is incredible.
[24:09.680 --> 24:10.680]  Guess what?
[24:10.680 --> 24:16.040]  Now, we are at LEDs that are 80% efficient.
[24:16.040 --> 24:18.040]  That's why it's the end of the road.
[24:18.040 --> 24:23.200]  You can't get past 100, and the LEDs are going to creep up toward 100.
[24:23.200 --> 24:24.200]  It's just amazing.
[24:24.440 --> 24:28.360]  Yeah, theoretically, LEDs can become 100% efficient.
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.040]  We'll never get to 100, but at some point, we'll be at 95% efficiency.
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.160]  And that's why I think it's pretty easy to predict that there's not going to be something
[24:37.160 --> 24:41.880]  else that comes along that is going to be even better than LEDs.
[24:41.880 --> 24:45.720]  We talk a lot about the light-to-heat ratios of things.
[24:45.720 --> 24:48.720]  Light is good, heat is bad.
[24:48.720 --> 24:57.440]  And LEDs, interestingly enough, when you calculate the light-to-heat ratio of sunlight,
[24:57.440 --> 25:06.080]  that the energy in the photons versus the total energy of the sun, you get about 2 micromoles
[25:06.080 --> 25:09.160]  per joule from the sunlight.
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.400]  And this is the photosynthetic photon flux divided by total energy.
[25:14.400 --> 25:18.880]  And LEDs now, we're past 3 micromoles per joule.
[25:18.880 --> 25:19.880]  It's amazing.
[25:19.880 --> 25:25.040]  LEDs have caught up and passed the sun for efficiency.
[25:25.040 --> 25:26.040]  That's a fun stat.
[25:26.040 --> 25:29.720]  I've never really thought about the efficiency of the sun, but that makes sense.
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.240]  And it is a really good indication of how good these LEDs are now.
[25:33.240 --> 25:37.480]  And then the other exciting thing, of course, is that with these LEDs, unlike the high-intensity
[25:37.480 --> 25:40.880]  discharged lights, we can get that precision control.
[25:40.880 --> 25:45.280]  That was never going to be possible with HID lights.
[25:45.280 --> 25:51.600]  So it's not just the efficiency, it's also the controllability of these LED fixtures
[25:51.600 --> 25:53.200]  that is going to be really beneficial.
[25:53.200 --> 25:58.520]  When you think about commercial buildings, in many cases, those lights are already dimming
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.280]  automatically in response to how much light is coming into the building.
[26:02.280 --> 26:06.640]  You don't notice it because it is gradual and your eyes adjust to it.
[26:06.640 --> 26:12.400]  But it is one other way in which we can use these LEDs to be really energy efficient.
[26:12.400 --> 26:13.400]  Yeah.
[26:13.400 --> 26:19.400]  Well, that's why we wanted to have this discussion about precision timing of delivery, because
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.640]  when people think about LEDs, they're all about, okay, what's the optimum spectra and
[26:23.640 --> 26:26.360]  what colors should I use?
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.200]  That's a huge subject, which we've talked about many times.
[26:30.200 --> 26:34.200]  But in addition to that, there's this timing of delivery, which is great.
[26:34.200 --> 26:36.200]  It's a new frontier.
[26:36.760 --> 26:43.360]  And I think that's going to be the next big advance in lighting control in controlled
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.440]  environment agriculture.
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.680]  And it is really important.
[26:47.680 --> 26:51.640]  You think about it, it's obvious in greenhouses where you have the sunlight that is constantly
[26:51.640 --> 26:52.640]  changing.
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.320]  When you think about a plant factory where the cost of electricity is an even bigger
[26:57.320 --> 27:00.120]  part of the overall production cost, right?
[27:00.120 --> 27:06.000]  If they can respond to those real-time pricing changes that are happening, they could substantially
[27:06.800 --> 27:08.080]  reduce our electricity cost.
[27:08.080 --> 27:13.840]  That is going to require collaboration, I think, between utility companies and those
[27:13.840 --> 27:19.640]  plant factories, because I think utility companies are going to have to provide incentives for
[27:19.640 --> 27:26.240]  vertical farming companies to implement some of that better approach that can help the
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.200]  utility companies in a big time.
[27:29.200 --> 27:30.200]  Yeah.
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.480]  You know, one of the things that comes to mind for greenhouses is, as you mentioned
[27:35.480 --> 27:40.640]  recently, if you run your lights late at night, people complain about the light pollution.
[27:40.640 --> 27:42.200]  Well, so shift it.
[27:42.200 --> 27:45.880]  So let's turn them on early in the morning and off earlier.
[27:45.880 --> 27:48.080]  Then people don't complain about light pollution.
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.520]  If the lights come on at 4 a.m., but boy, if they don't go off till 10 p.m., there's
[27:53.520 --> 27:55.440]  a lot of heartburn about that.
[27:55.440 --> 27:56.440]  So shift it.
[27:56.440 --> 28:01.200]  Lights are fine doing something like that, something simple like that.
[28:01.200 --> 28:02.200]  Yeah.
[28:02.200 --> 28:04.640]  It's simple for a greenhouse to just shift that light.
[28:04.640 --> 28:08.960]  It actually creates some interesting challenges from a control perspective, because if we
[28:08.960 --> 28:14.880]  provide a lot of light later in the day, we have already measured how much sunlight that
[28:14.880 --> 28:16.680]  greenhouse got during the day.
[28:16.680 --> 28:21.200]  And so we know exactly how much more light we need to provide during that evening.
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.520]  The challenge is, if we provide light early in the morning, we don't know how much light
[28:26.520 --> 28:29.160]  those plants are going to get later in the day.
[28:29.160 --> 28:34.800]  And so another thing that we need to incorporate, I think, in these lighting control algorithms
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.160]  is forecasts of how much solar radiation or how much light is going to be available during
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.160]  the day.
[28:41.160 --> 28:46.240]  And then we can start taking that into account at 3 a.m. when there is no sunlight yet.
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.040]  And luckily enough, those forecasts are readily available because the photovoltaic or solar
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.400]  energy industry is heavily dependent on those forecasts.
[28:54.400 --> 28:58.400]  So they can simply be purchased from a variety of companies.
[28:58.400 --> 29:00.440]  That's the next thing that we want to look at.
[29:00.440 --> 29:01.440]  Yeah.
[29:01.440 --> 29:02.480]  Yeah, no, that's a really good point.
[29:02.480 --> 29:09.760]  As we do more solar PV, this forecasting gets super important for them, too, to match supply
[29:09.760 --> 29:10.760]  with demand.
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.040]  Yeah, we're just lucky that that industry is so dependent on that forecasting, because
[29:16.040 --> 29:21.020]  if it was just the greenhouse industry, I don't think anyone would bother actually developing
[29:21.020 --> 29:22.020]  these forecasts.
[29:22.020 --> 29:23.020]  Yeah.
[29:23.020 --> 29:26.740]  But they're readily available and we can take advantage of them.
[29:26.740 --> 29:28.740]  Well, thanks.
[29:28.740 --> 29:31.260]  This has been a great discussion.
[29:31.260 --> 29:33.100]  As we always say, stay tuned.
[29:33.100 --> 29:35.400]  This is an evolving thing.
[29:35.400 --> 29:37.420]  We keep getting new research data.
[29:37.420 --> 29:39.140]  Things change.
[29:39.140 --> 29:45.260]  We're always looking for ways to explain the basic science and find ways to use the basic
[29:45.260 --> 29:50.300]  science to commercialize it and help a lot of people.
[29:50.580 --> 29:57.620]  Well, thank you, Bruce, for having me and thank you for watching our conversation today.
[29:57.620 --> 29:58.620]  Stay tuned.
[29:58.620 --> 29:59.620]  We'll be in touch.
[29:59.620 --> 30:00.120]  Bye now.
