[00:01.470 --> 00:11.150]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and I wanted to record a video to discuss
[00:11.150 --> 00:16.550]  terminology for measuring photosynthetic radiation.
[00:16.550 --> 00:24.030]  This is real confusing to people, and the terms have evolved over the last 20 or 30
[00:24.030 --> 00:25.030]  years.
[00:25.030 --> 00:30.830]  So, since Apogee is in the business of helping people make excellent measurements of this,
[00:30.830 --> 00:35.070]  we want to make sure the terminology is also clear.
[00:35.070 --> 00:43.990]  So this is going to be a short video, but I want to take you back to the 1960s when
[00:43.990 --> 00:50.790]  we used to measure radiation only with a pyranometer.
[00:50.790 --> 00:53.190]  Now this is going way back.
[00:53.190 --> 00:56.590]  And let me put this curve over here.
[00:56.590 --> 01:04.230]  Here's wavelength, and this is all shortwave radiation, and this curve looks something
[01:04.230 --> 01:05.230]  like this.
[01:05.230 --> 01:08.950]  I'll fill in that spot right there.
[01:08.950 --> 01:20.270]  This is 2,800 nanometers out here, and this is about 280 nanometers right here.
[01:20.270 --> 01:25.830]  This is all shortwave radiation from the sun.
[01:25.830 --> 01:30.750]  Only this part right here causes photosynthesis.
[01:30.750 --> 01:34.190]  This is this part right in here.
[01:34.190 --> 01:40.430]  And you have to remember what the instruments were like in the 1960s.
[01:40.430 --> 01:45.230]  We measured all of this and used it to predict plant growth.
[01:45.230 --> 01:50.710]  But we also knew that this part over here is near infrared.
[01:50.710 --> 01:54.670]  I'm going to put NIR.
[01:54.670 --> 01:59.790]  And our instruments that included this, it was not a good prediction of plant growth.
[01:59.790 --> 02:10.070]  So with this, this is PAR right here, photosynthetically active radiation.
[02:10.070 --> 02:18.810]  This was the first term that we evolved to to say we're only counting PAR as the radiation.
[02:18.910 --> 02:24.090]  So this is in the 1960s and even into the 1970s.
[02:24.090 --> 02:27.090]  This was everywhere in the literature.
[02:27.090 --> 02:29.730]  PAR, that's what we're measuring.
[02:29.730 --> 02:33.330]  But what were the units people used?
[02:33.330 --> 02:42.010]  The units we use for all of this are watts per meter squared.
[02:42.010 --> 02:43.130]  Total energy.
[02:43.130 --> 02:49.410]  This is what drives transpiration, but it's not what drives photosynthesis.
[02:49.410 --> 02:52.090]  This part drives photosynthesis.
[02:52.090 --> 02:58.870]  So we developed this term PAR, but we kept the units the same.
[02:58.870 --> 03:05.650]  We said PAR was watts per meter squared, and it was an improvement over the whole thing.
[03:05.650 --> 03:06.650]  Time passes.
[03:06.650 --> 03:12.570]  Keith McCree comes out in the early 1970s and says, no, it's not the energy.
[03:12.570 --> 03:17.130]  It's the number of photons that cause photosynthesis.
[03:17.130 --> 03:21.250]  We need to start counting photons, not energy.
[03:21.250 --> 03:33.760]  So we evolved from the term PAR to measure, this stands for photosynthetically active
[03:33.760 --> 03:43.200]  radiation, to a term called PPF.
[03:43.200 --> 03:47.780]  Now this is an easy term to remember, photosynthetically active radiation.
[03:47.780 --> 03:55.480]  This stands for photosynthetic photon flux, and it's a more rigorous term.
[03:55.480 --> 04:05.120]  And this, in the 1960s and 70s, this often meant watts per meter squared, which was not
[04:05.120 --> 04:07.940]  very accurate.
[04:07.940 --> 04:17.740]  This specifically meant micromoles of photons per meter squared per second.
[04:17.740 --> 04:20.160]  The story would end here.
[04:20.160 --> 04:26.740]  This is a more rigorous term for moles of photons than the old term PAR, but language
[04:26.740 --> 04:28.640]  evolves.
[04:28.640 --> 04:40.320]  People kept using PAR to mean micromoles per meter squared per second.
[04:40.320 --> 04:41.680]  So it got confusing.
[04:41.680 --> 04:47.480]  These terms were used interchangeably, and they are used interchangeably to this day,
[04:47.480 --> 04:52.760]  but we try to use a more rigorous term for just the photon flux.
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.280]  Now the P stands for photosynthetic.
[04:56.280 --> 04:59.080]  That means 400 to 700.
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.720]  I'll write this down here.
[05:00.720 --> 05:09.040]  If you're going to get a degree in plant science, you got to measure 400, you got to remember
[05:09.040 --> 05:12.240]  400 to 700.
[05:12.240 --> 05:14.800]  Both of these are photosynthetic.
[05:14.800 --> 05:16.840]  This is a photon flux.
[05:16.840 --> 05:25.200]  Now what about P, P, F, D?
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.440]  Is that different?
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.560]  It depends on what part of the literature you read.
[05:31.560 --> 05:38.480]  These two terms have been used interchangeably for 50 years in the literature, and they are
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.100]  still used interchangeably today.
[05:42.100 --> 05:51.500]  And even during my career as a researcher, we have used these interchangeably, but we
[05:51.500 --> 05:57.260]  are evolving now to different definitions.
[05:57.260 --> 06:01.740]  How can this, the D stands for density.
[06:01.740 --> 06:07.560]  If you look up on the internet the word flux, now let me see if we can do this.
[06:07.560 --> 06:09.420]  We go to a next screen.
[06:09.460 --> 06:12.900]  I'll come back to that screen.
[06:12.900 --> 06:17.560]  Flux.
[06:17.560 --> 06:20.520]  What's the definition of a flux?
[06:20.520 --> 06:28.780]  If you type it in, do a Google search, you come to the Wikipedia page and it says flux
[06:28.780 --> 06:46.340]  equals an amount per area per time.
[06:46.340 --> 06:51.920]  This is micromoles per meter squared per second.
[06:51.920 --> 07:07.090]  If you look up flux density, this is also micromoles per meter squared per second, but
[07:07.090 --> 07:13.410]  it turns out physicists have trouble with the word flux.
[07:13.410 --> 07:25.160]  Many people define flux as just an amount, I'm going to abbreviate amount, per time.
[07:25.160 --> 07:32.300]  And if flux means an amount per time, let me put something like about.
[07:32.300 --> 07:35.560]  These terms are used interchangeably.
[07:35.560 --> 07:44.640]  If flux means an amount per time, then we reserve flux density for amount per area per
[07:44.640 --> 07:56.370]  time, AMT, amount area time.
[07:56.370 --> 08:12.530]  So in my publications, starting about three years ago, we started to use PPFD instead
[08:12.530 --> 08:18.250]  of PPF.
[08:18.250 --> 08:24.190]  When we use PPF, the argument was that the D is redundant, and that's the worst case
[08:24.190 --> 08:28.110]  in writing to put redundant things in your writing.
[08:28.110 --> 08:32.050]  The PPF was adequate.
[08:32.050 --> 08:36.470]  But some people were using PPFD separately.
[08:36.470 --> 08:45.310]  I did a big literature survey, and it turns out people in plant ecology were using PPFD.
[08:45.310 --> 08:51.210]  People in horticulture and agronomy were mostly using PPF.
[08:51.230 --> 08:55.850]  So different disciplines use this acronym slightly differently.
[08:55.850 --> 09:02.250]  You would think that's horribly confusing, but both of them always showed the units after
[09:02.250 --> 09:03.250]  this.
[09:03.250 --> 09:07.150]  And as long as you show the units, you know what people are talking about.
[09:07.150 --> 09:16.750]  About three years ago, I started using PPFD, and what that means is now we can use PPF
[09:16.750 --> 09:28.730]  to mean just, I'm going to see if I can put it right here, micromoles per second.
[09:28.730 --> 09:31.150]  No area in this.
[09:31.150 --> 09:33.770]  This one for sure has the area.
[09:33.770 --> 09:37.910]  This is area times time.
[09:37.910 --> 09:47.830]  So historically, these have been used interchangeably, but we're trying to shift the terminology
[09:47.830 --> 09:48.830]  in the literature.
[09:48.830 --> 09:54.910]  This is papers that I review as a scientist in both my own writing to use PPFD.
[09:54.910 --> 10:02.870]  The argument now is it's better to be redundant than it is to risk being unclear, because
[10:02.870 --> 10:05.110]  D always means area.
[10:05.110 --> 10:13.470]  So now we're starting to evolve a definition where this just means per second, no area
[10:13.470 --> 10:15.030]  in it.
[10:15.030 --> 10:17.410]  That's the difference between these terms.
[10:17.410 --> 10:27.710]  So if we go back to this, PAR is still used by lots of people in just common speech to
[10:27.710 --> 10:36.590]  refer to a photon flux density, but technically we try and reserve the term PAR for a generic
[10:36.590 --> 10:41.950]  term that could mean energy flux, it could mean photon flux.
[10:41.950 --> 10:52.630]  PPFD we try and reserve for an amount per area per time, and then now we're starting
[10:52.630 --> 11:00.030]  to use PPF, no meter squared, just micromoles per second.
[11:00.030 --> 11:10.270]  So in our literature at Apogee, you will see when we talk about a flux, we will say PPFD.
[11:10.270 --> 11:16.110]  Maybe it's redundant to some people, but it's absolutely clear to have all four of those
[11:16.110 --> 11:17.910]  letters in there.
[11:17.910 --> 11:28.390]  An example of this would be, let's take a light, let me see if we can go, one more screen.
[11:28.390 --> 11:39.990]  If we're testing some light, and this has photons coming out of it, if we want to know
[11:39.990 --> 11:52.390]  the total number of photons out of this light, we would do a PPF in micromoles per second.
[11:52.390 --> 11:55.070]  There's no area, it's a total.
[11:55.070 --> 12:00.810]  It doesn't matter if the photons way over here or in the middle, it's a total number
[12:00.810 --> 12:01.810]  of photons.
[12:01.810 --> 12:07.230]  This is important when we're testing an efficacy of a light.
[12:07.230 --> 12:13.110]  But if we want to know the intensity at any given place, now we have to put the meter
[12:13.110 --> 12:18.030]  squared in here and say this is the intensity.
[12:18.030 --> 12:24.550]  Because if you don't know the area, you don't know the amount of light for plant growth,
[12:24.550 --> 12:29.670]  and now when we put that area in there, it becomes PPFD.
[12:29.670 --> 12:33.950]  And the D stands for density, and that stands for meter squared.
[12:33.950 --> 12:38.910]  A way to think about this, let's try one more screen.
[12:38.910 --> 12:48.550]  If we have a box right here, oh man, that's a bad box.
[12:48.550 --> 12:52.510]  Let's see if we can erase that.
[12:52.510 --> 12:59.380]  There.
[12:59.380 --> 13:04.780]  Here's a three-dimensional box, like a giant cookie sheet.
[13:04.780 --> 13:18.740]  Here's our photons coming in like raindrops into this box, falling into it.
[13:18.740 --> 13:25.980]  If we want to know the number of photons we get, we want to know amount of raindrops per
[13:25.980 --> 13:28.420]  meter squared of box per unit time.
[13:28.420 --> 13:33.660]  We've defined all three things, and now we know the intensity of the rainfall.
[13:33.660 --> 13:42.100]  If we just said the photons, there was 10,000 photons per second, it's not helpful because
[13:42.100 --> 13:44.140]  we need to know the intensity.
[13:44.140 --> 13:47.540]  We always need to have the meters squared in there.
[13:47.540 --> 13:51.300]  So when you read literature, look for the units.
[13:51.300 --> 13:56.740]  If the units are correct, and they should be micromoles per meter squared per second,
[13:56.740 --> 14:00.980]  you will see the older literature used to call that PPF, and that's fine as long as
[14:00.980 --> 14:03.200]  they've defined it.
[14:03.240 --> 14:10.160]  But we're trying to change this to PPFD, and we have begun using that, Adapogee, we've
[14:10.160 --> 14:18.240]  begun using it in science, and that's the evolution of language from one term that we
[14:18.240 --> 14:24.440]  thought was adequate to a new term that has more letters in it to be more precise.
[14:24.440 --> 14:26.560]  Thanks for listening.
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.480]  Look forward to talking to you again soon.
[14:32.520 --> 14:35.320]  And one more thing.
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.200]  There's a new term that we have started to use in our research.
[14:40.200 --> 14:48.680]  Remember that this P stands for photosynthetic, and that means 400 to 700, but we now know
[14:48.680 --> 14:50.320]  these photons out here.
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.440]  Let's see if we can put this in red.
[14:54.440 --> 15:02.440]  There's photons right here that we call far-red radiation that actually cause some photosynthesis.
[15:02.560 --> 15:10.280]  So we're calling into question this whole definition of 400 to 700, and even more than
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.480]  that down here, let's see if we can do this in blue.
[15:15.480 --> 15:23.000]  This is ultraviolet, and these have some effect both on photosynthesis and on plant growth.
[15:23.000 --> 15:31.760]  But if we say the PPFD, that automatically excludes these because the P means photosynthetic
[15:32.080 --> 15:36.800]  and for 30, 40, 50 years we've said that's 400 to 700.
[15:36.800 --> 15:43.080]  So now we're looking into the future evolution of language and terminology more than language.
[15:43.080 --> 15:52.000]  So we have a new term, the PFD.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.720]  Just when you thought you had it right, here's a new term.
[15:55.720 --> 15:59.320]  This P stands for photons, not photosynthetic.
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.280]  The photon flux density.
[16:03.280 --> 16:09.440]  And when we use this term, we are not constrained by 400 to 700.
[16:09.440 --> 16:21.970]  So when we do research, the PFD, when we're using it, can mean 300 to 800.
[16:21.970 --> 16:28.570]  So here's a new emerging term that counts these photons at the edges.
[16:28.570 --> 16:31.850]  Doesn't have the extra P in it, which means photosynthetic.
[16:31.850 --> 16:35.010]  It's just the total number of photons.
[16:35.010 --> 16:37.850]  Watch for it in the literature.
[16:37.850 --> 16:39.330]  It's going to be a useful term.
[16:39.330 --> 16:39.850]  Thanks.
