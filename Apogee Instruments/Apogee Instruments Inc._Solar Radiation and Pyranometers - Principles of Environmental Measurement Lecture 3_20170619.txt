[00:01.660 --> 00:32.360]  One of the other very key measurements is solar radiation to any input.
[00:32.360 --> 00:38.720]  For decades the only instruments available were expensive blackbody pyranometers.
[00:38.720 --> 00:46.520]  Then silicon cell pyranometers became available. I think we have some
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.720]  here they're in the catalogs. Let's see if I can, we got one sitting here. Well
[00:52.720 --> 01:00.140]  this is close. This is actually a quantum sensor but they're this
[01:00.140 --> 01:08.800]  size. They're tiny and now silicon cell pyranometers are almost an order of
[01:08.920 --> 01:16.800]  magnitude cheaper than blackbody pyranometers. All of us use silicon
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.340]  cell pyranometers on weather stations to get solar radiation for our Penman
[01:21.340 --> 01:27.760]  Monteith models and everything else. We just say great we've just saved a
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.480]  lot of money. What I want to show you is the differences and the errors that
[01:32.480 --> 01:40.240]  you get with silicon cell pyranometers. These are not widely
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.200]  appreciated, it's only our work comparing them rigorously back and forth that
[01:45.200 --> 01:55.920]  we've seen these things. This comes from the fact that blackbody pyranometers, and
[01:55.920 --> 02:02.600]  you look at them there's a glass dome and a black disk, record all of the
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.640]  wavelength, all of the radiation over this whole solar spectrum. This is the
[02:07.640 --> 02:16.360]  entire solar spectrum and on a typical sunny day. They measure all of this, these
[02:16.360 --> 02:22.720]  are all giant bands of absorption of water vapor in the spectrum. Outside the
[02:22.720 --> 02:28.880]  atmosphere it's a smooth curve, but silicon cells pyranometers subsample
[02:28.880 --> 02:36.560]  this spectra and predict the rest. We do that all the time in science, we
[02:36.560 --> 02:44.120]  subsample things and then we predict the whole and that's fine, but subsampling
[02:44.120 --> 02:51.360]  changes the spectra changes with atmospheric humidity. What I'll show
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.680]  you is the data on how does atmospheric humidity affect this spectra and how
[02:56.680 --> 03:08.440]  does it affect the accuracy of our silicon cell pyranometers. I don't
[03:08.440 --> 03:16.040]  know how many of these I need, but this curve, this will relate to the next
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.520]  talk in photosynthetic radiation. There's so many things you can see from this
[03:20.600 --> 03:27.200]  curve and we made a refrigerator magnet. Nowadays not everybody puts these on
[03:27.200 --> 03:31.040]  refrigerators, but I go around and people have these on their filing
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.200]  cabinets so they can see the curve. Here's a magnet you could pass around
[03:35.200 --> 03:42.000]  and take one and don't put it by a disk, it might demagnetize it or it
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.560]  might change it. This is just a curve showing this in a couple different
[03:45.760 --> 03:53.200]  units. Here's watts per meter squared. What happens on cloudy days?
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.240]  Here's the whole spectrum as an introduction to radiation measurements.
[03:57.240 --> 04:02.120]  Radiation was what Apogee has cut its teeth on, quantum sensors and
[04:02.120 --> 04:08.800]  that's were known as a radiation sensor company. That's the whole curve. Now we
[04:08.800 --> 04:14.720]  get photosynthetically active, which is most people in this room we've got four
[04:14.760 --> 04:19.640]  hundred and seven hundred memorized. That's the range of wavelengths that
[04:19.640 --> 04:23.800]  cause photosynthesis. It's also really close to the range of wavelengths for
[04:23.800 --> 04:31.320]  human vision. Then finally down here UV. There's times when we just want to
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.780]  measure this, but with pyranometers we're measuring the whole thing. It's all
[04:35.780 --> 04:41.240]  thermal radiation that's what drives the change of state of water from liquid to
[04:41.240 --> 04:48.200]  gas. Here's blackbody and silicon cells. Now look at how this curve changes on a
[04:48.200 --> 04:55.040]  cloudy day. Atmospheric water vapor not only takes out these bands but it
[04:55.040 --> 05:02.120]  greatly reduces these bands of radiation. If you measure the whole thing with a
[05:02.120 --> 05:07.240]  blackbody pyranometer you accurately measure this, but if you're only
[05:07.440 --> 05:14.040]  sub-sampling it, look at this. This spectra is hardly changed in the short
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.880]  wavelengths on a cloudy day. It selectively shifts the wavelengths this
[05:18.880 --> 05:27.240]  direction and this is the spectral response of a silicon cell. These smaller
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.400]  silicon cell pyranometers that we all use,
[05:35.920 --> 05:41.000]  and it selectively measures this, it doesn't measure this. What happens is
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.400]  they over measure on cloudy days because they're sub-sampling the part that's
[05:46.400 --> 05:54.280]  transmitted more. How bad is this effect of over sampling? Almost 10%
[05:54.280 --> 06:00.640]  depending on how much cloudy sky there is, but that's a big error on cloudy
[06:00.640 --> 06:07.240]  days. Let's take a look at a couple of cloudy days in here. Here happens to be
[06:07.240 --> 06:15.400]  three days when we had full Sun which is what these sensors are calibrated to and
[06:15.400 --> 06:20.680]  then partly cloudy and then a significantly cloudy here. If you just
[06:20.680 --> 06:25.920]  look at this, it looks like the curves are really pretty close. The blackbody
[06:25.920 --> 06:33.200]  and silicon cell, but when you calculate the errors, almost none here and it just
[06:33.200 --> 06:38.960]  gets bigger here. Here's where we're 9, 10, even times it's greater than a
[06:38.960 --> 06:46.320]  10% error. You can of course correct for this if you know the effect and you
[06:46.320 --> 06:52.320]  know the fraction of clouds, but rarely do people do this. They just assume
[06:52.320 --> 06:57.840]  the silicon cell is correct at all times. There's a bottom line, there's a
[06:57.840 --> 07:05.560]  humidity effect on this measurement. Here's the magnitude of
[07:05.560 --> 07:10.240]  the effect here. Again, they're accurate in full Sun because they're
[07:10.240 --> 07:20.840]  calibrated to full Sun. This is a same thing data ratio of clear sky to actual
[07:20.840 --> 07:25.320]  and the error always goes high in these conditions. This is also probably a
[07:25.320 --> 07:31.360]  pretty good example of models. This is an average of these, but this
[07:31.360 --> 07:35.320]  should taper down to zero and there's just a few data points. If you fit
[07:35.320 --> 07:39.800]  this with the model, that red line is really not very representative up here
[07:39.860 --> 07:45.200]  because we don't have enough data to make that. It's an example of how we take
[07:45.200 --> 07:51.000]  data and make a model of it. On severely cloudy days or significantly cloudy
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.200]  days, it's a pretty big error from silicon cell pyranometers. The good news
[07:57.200 --> 08:04.440]  about this is the cost of blackbody pyranometers continues to come down and
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.280]  because of these errors, we've sold a silicon cell pyranometer for a long
[08:09.280 --> 08:14.520]  long time and we just tell people about these errors. Because of this and
[08:14.520 --> 08:18.520]  because of the need to make accurate solar radiation measurements and all the
[08:18.520 --> 08:24.880]  days, Apogee has now developed a blackbody pyranometer that looks
[08:24.880 --> 08:31.640]  like this and it doesn't have these kinds of errors because of the
[08:31.640 --> 08:40.800]  spectra that it measures. The second source of error among instruments is
[08:40.800 --> 08:47.040]  called cosine error and that refers to how accurately does the sensor measure
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.040]  all the angles of radiation. You can put any light sensor out there and get some
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.680]  relative indication of light, but it is really difficult to calibrate it for
[08:58.680 --> 09:03.200]  light coming right straight down and have it also be accurate when the light
[09:03.200 --> 09:09.360]  comes in at a low angle. Or same thing on a cloudy day where there's equal
[09:09.360 --> 09:15.080]  radiation from all angles, the sensor has to accurately integrate all those angles.
[09:15.080 --> 09:24.240]  Here's an example of low angle radiation and coming in at this and that's
[09:24.240 --> 09:29.920]  why we call this cosine correction because if it's coming in this angle the
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.720]  sensor should read 500. It's not supposed to read a thousand, that's cosine
[09:34.720 --> 09:41.880]  correction. Does it really read 500 if it's at that angle? You have to get
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.560]  that correction with the optics of the sensor and all radiation manufacturers
[09:46.560 --> 09:53.480]  work hard to get cosine correction. At least the ones selling what we call
[09:53.520 --> 09:57.160]  research-grade instruments. There's plenty of pyranometers out there that are
[09:57.160 --> 10:06.200]  really cheap and boy they do a terrible job of this. I worry about
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.040]  people selling cheap instruments and getting the cosine really
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.640]  wrong. If you know what you're doing you can test this compared to a
[10:15.640 --> 10:21.200]  better instrument, but this cosine is one of the things that people forget when
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.000]  lower-cost manufacturers sometimes forget. Here's all the angles coming
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.440]  into this thing. This is a graph of the angle and the error. In this case this
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.760]  is a bunch of pyranometers and the standard deviations. The morning and
[10:38.760 --> 10:42.640]  evening are slightly different so they're really close until we get out to
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.920]  75 degrees and then the errors get bigger. This means they're not as accurate
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.840]  at dawn and dusk for those measurements, but there's not very much radiation out
[10:53.840 --> 11:00.400]  here either. It's low light so a 5% error in low light is not that big of an
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.560]  error in absolute terms. You would like these instruments to be accurate
[11:05.560 --> 11:12.400]  all day long and summer and winter. How about changing sun angles? We get summer
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.480]  angles in here and then we get winter angles over here. If it's not cosine
[11:17.520 --> 11:21.400]  corrected it can have a big seasonal error because they're typically
[11:21.400 --> 11:33.600]  calibrated for summer sunlight angles. We specify these often by the error
[11:33.600 --> 11:41.040]  out here at 75 degrees. This is an example of how companies write
[11:41.040 --> 11:47.040]  specifications to how accurate are they out there. You can't just test one sensor
[11:47.120 --> 11:52.000]  you got to take your entire pool of sensors with replicates and you want to
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.720]  make sure your specification matches all your instruments not just your best
[11:57.720 --> 12:07.560]  sensors. We specify 5% at 75 degrees and this is two times the standard
[12:07.560 --> 12:16.080]  deviation which is 96% of the tested sensors. Stability, this is
[12:16.080 --> 12:22.440]  characteristic of all instruments. How stable are they long-term? Humidity
[12:22.440 --> 12:27.600]  companies have said everybody can build a humidity sensor and it's accurate on
[12:27.600 --> 12:34.520]  day one. Now check it two years later, three years later. All sensors drift but
[12:34.520 --> 12:42.600]  companies work hard to minimize that drift. This is some tests of silicon
[12:42.600 --> 12:48.900]  pyranometers for long-term drift compared to high-end blackbody. Now Kipp &
[12:48.900 --> 12:53.460]  Zonen sells very expensive high-end blackbodies. This is on the roof of our
[12:53.460 --> 12:59.440]  building in Logan Utah. Multiple replicate high-end instruments to get a
[12:59.440 --> 13:06.980]  very accurate reference point. You can see there's two glass domes inside of
[13:06.980 --> 13:16.820]  these to make a primary standard instrument. Here's data. Now we don't
[13:16.820 --> 13:21.300]  show the hundred pyranometers next to these but it's a big table of
[13:21.300 --> 13:28.140]  checking them. This is some data that were compared. The mean change was
[13:28.140 --> 13:35.020]  only 0.1% per year. On average these are very stable. It's a very hard
[13:35.060 --> 13:39.540]  number to even measure. You have to go 10 years before you even see a 1%
[13:39.540 --> 13:46.460]  drift. There's some variability in these so we had some that drifted as
[13:46.460 --> 13:52.140]  much as 1.8%. Now oddly enough some went up too. They don't always drift
[13:52.140 --> 13:57.520]  down. There's tiny changes in the optics that affect the stability of the
[13:57.520 --> 14:05.360]  instruments. Because of this we write our spec at 2% a year drift.
[14:05.360 --> 14:12.120]  All of the sensors should drift less than that even though the
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.840]  mean is less than a tenth of a percent a year. Again I talked about this
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.440]  accelerated aging before but to really be sure you've got quality instruments
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.920]  you need to check long-term stability. It's one of the troubles with new
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.640]  instruments. Everybody gets excited with new instruments. How much did the
[14:31.640 --> 14:37.440]  manufacturer test those for long-term stability? You can't put them in an
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.120]  environment for 10 years you're depriving people of that new technology
[14:41.120 --> 14:46.560]  but you can run accelerated aging tests to try and make them fail to get better
[14:46.560 --> 14:52.400]  confidence that they're going to work in a range of environments. The tropics and
[14:52.400 --> 14:59.480]  the cold places, warm places, that's a critical thing with research-grade
[14:59.480 --> 15:07.280]  instruments. Another little point on these, here's some frost. Now here we
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.800]  are in Sydney you don't get frost here right but you get dew, you get
[15:12.800 --> 15:19.720]  condensation here. Here was a morning where we had cold morning with frost
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.880]  and actually this might be a radiation frost which we'll talk about in a little
[15:23.880 --> 15:31.000]  bit. These two sensors right here are clear. They're clear because they're
[15:31.000 --> 15:38.120]  heated and with this little sensor we can put a tiny little resistance heater
[15:38.120 --> 15:44.360]  in this and warm it up just slightly to keep condensation off the sensor and to
[15:44.360 --> 15:50.640]  keep dew off the sensor. We call that occlusion of the optical path. If
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.920]  there's anything on that sensor it's going to read incorrectly and frost is
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.760]  huge. I got some pictures in here of snow on sensors that's also huge. It
[16:01.760 --> 16:08.560]  blocks it sits on the sensor. You can buy heaters for those primary standard
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.840]  pyranometers but now we're talking five to ten thousand dollars for one
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.520]  instrument that's heated and ventilated to make an accurate measurement versus a
[16:19.520 --> 16:26.600]  few hundred dollars for a tiny sensor that has a heater in it. Those heaters
[16:26.600 --> 16:31.440]  have helped quite a bit to help people make more accurate measurements in
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.320]  places that get condensation or in places that get snow and frost. Here's
[16:36.320 --> 16:43.840]  some example of snow buried under snow here and and above the snow there. It's
[16:43.840 --> 16:52.440]  also on a pedestal to keep it above so snow can't stick to it. Temperature
[16:52.440 --> 16:58.400]  affects radiation sensors. This is an example of a comparative test that we've
[16:58.400 --> 17:04.520]  done with LiCOR silicon pyranometers and ours. There's a tiny temperature
[17:04.520 --> 17:11.440]  effect in here. Most research grade sensors this is a small effect. Look at
[17:11.440 --> 17:17.200]  this goes from minus 10 to plus 40 and the effect is only 1%. Again for
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.040]  precision measurements this is repeatable so you can measure and
[17:21.040 --> 17:27.920]  correct for the temperature effect on the sensor. It depends on how accurate
[17:27.920 --> 17:39.060]  you need the solar radiation. I think this might be my last slide in this.
[17:39.060 --> 17:52.380]  This relates to that. Remember how we
[17:52.380 --> 17:57.940]  sub-sampled the solar radiation? We often want to know, turn them upside down
[17:57.940 --> 18:04.460]  and know reflected radiation from the ground and that's net shortwave
[18:04.460 --> 18:10.540]  radiation. We take a carefully calibrated silicon cell sensor and
[18:10.540 --> 18:15.980]  turn it upside down and we say great now we know incoming and we'll subtract
[18:15.980 --> 18:23.620]  outgoing and we have net shortwave radiation. That would be wrong because
[18:23.980 --> 18:29.300]  this sub-samples you turn it upside down and the reflected radiation is different.
[18:29.300 --> 18:35.460]  You can get significant errors if you turn this upside down to do reflected
[18:35.460 --> 18:41.420]  radiation. Here's the magnitude of the errors 14% error over a grass canopy.
[18:41.420 --> 18:49.260]  You can see almost 20% errors. You should never use a silicon cell
[18:49.260 --> 18:53.860]  pyranometer upside down to get reflected radiation. They are not
[18:53.860 --> 19:01.100]  calibrated for that. You have to go to a blackbody pyranometer which doesn't have
[19:01.100 --> 19:06.740]  this source of radiation. These are so inexpensive, hold your question, these are
[19:06.740 --> 19:13.860]  so inexpensive everybody gets tempted to do this. If you know this and
[19:13.860 --> 19:20.260]  you're confident and you could correct for it in software, but man you get
[19:20.260 --> 19:26.500]  really nervous about all these fudge factors. Sometimes they can
[19:26.500 --> 19:34.900]  make measurements worse. Yes? What about if you use it in vertical position?
[19:34.900 --> 19:42.340]  You said upside down, but if you have it 90 degrees.
[19:42.340 --> 19:47.740]  That's how you carefully level these. They're on a leveling
[19:47.740 --> 19:53.260]  plate so the standard position is perfectly vertical. It would be a big error if you use it
[19:53.260 --> 20:02.460]  vertical like in a wall. Oh like this? Yes, there is. Same thing because
[20:02.540 --> 20:08.060]  now you're not measuring the sky, it's reflected. The errors would be
[20:08.060 --> 20:16.100]  similar to this because we're sub sampling and the
[20:16.100 --> 20:22.940]  spectra changes. Same thing as clouds. I spent some time in this because
[20:22.940 --> 20:27.180]  lots of people use these this way and you tell them not to and they still do.
[20:27.180 --> 20:34.980]  People don't read the owner's manual, they just say I like this
[20:34.980 --> 20:44.780]  sensor and I'm going to use it. This is something we've done a bunch of
[20:44.780 --> 20:48.860]  work on to characterize these errors and try and make people aware of them. Through
[20:48.860 --> 20:54.900]  workshops like this, through videos online, if you know what you're doing as
[20:55.100 --> 21:00.020]  a research scientist, you can often get away with a lower cost sensor because
[21:00.020 --> 21:05.020]  you know its limitations. Pretty often it's people that don't know what
[21:05.020 --> 21:08.980]  they're doing that get tempted to buy low-cost sensors and then they misuse
[21:08.980 --> 21:15.060]  them and they have big errors. It's sad because you see it all too
[21:15.060 --> 21:21.460]  often. Part of what we want to help you do is evaluate specifications of
[21:21.460 --> 21:27.260]  instruments. You don't need to overbuy expensive instruments, but if you
[21:27.260 --> 21:33.500]  understand the specs sometimes you can get away with less than the
[21:33.500 --> 21:38.780]  the highest cost instruments if you really know what you're doing and the
[21:38.780 --> 21:46.820]  limitations of the sensors. Leveling is a big source of error. Sensors drift
[21:46.980 --> 21:52.420]  they become unleveled. People don't check that often enough. What if
[21:52.420 --> 21:57.740]  the sensor starts to tilt very slightly to the Sun or away from the Sun? You can
[21:57.740 --> 22:02.900]  quickly get big errors from leveling. We spend a lot of time making really
[22:02.900 --> 22:07.060]  rigorous leveling mounts and they all have a bubble level, but now you got to
[22:07.060 --> 22:10.460]  climb in your tower and look at that bubble level to see that it's
[22:10.460 --> 22:18.900]  staying level. Occlusion of the sensor of the dome is a problem. Some sensors
[22:18.900 --> 22:24.740]  that are flat trap debris, they trap water, they trap dew. That's an error and of
[22:24.740 --> 22:29.340]  course you can clean the sensors, but how many of us do? We don't. Now
[22:29.340 --> 22:33.980]  they read 10% low maybe until you get a rainstorm
[22:33.980 --> 22:40.220]  and it flushes the sensor clean. Sensors that have a dome top help.
[22:40.460 --> 22:45.740]  A lot. The water is self-cleaning and the water tends to run off.
[22:45.740 --> 22:53.060]  Dome tops help keep the sensor clean. It also helps keep it dry. That's
[22:53.060 --> 22:57.820]  another nemesis of all instrument manufacturers is moisture getting in
[22:57.820 --> 23:05.260]  their sensors causing drift or even the sensor to fail.
[23:05.260 --> 23:19.390]  If you look at
[23:19.390 --> 23:23.470]  high-end sensors, and now unfortunately we can't quite see them in this picture
[23:23.470 --> 23:28.310]  because these are all shield and aspirated to get peak
[23:28.310 --> 23:34.990]  accuracy, but you see a little side port with desiccant in the port and
[23:35.150 --> 23:40.270]  often it changes design to change color. If water vapor gets inside the
[23:40.270 --> 23:48.070]  sensor you change that. We go to a conference in Brussels
[23:48.070 --> 23:53.070]  each year, a world meteorological conference. Kipp and Sonen doesn't have
[23:53.070 --> 23:58.990]  that little disc with desiccant anymore on their sensors. Doesn't that keep
[23:58.990 --> 24:03.070]  your sensor dry internally? Keep this perfectly dry so you never have
[24:03.150 --> 24:08.310]  condensation. They said the biggest source of leaks in our sensor was that
[24:08.310 --> 24:13.790]  port, that little desiccant port. We just took it out and now we have a
[24:13.790 --> 24:17.910]  better sealing and it's dry when it's manufactured. We hope it's going to stay
[24:17.910 --> 24:21.950]  dry for many years. It's an interesting change in the development of
[24:21.950 --> 24:27.230]  sensors. They felt like taking that out helped people make better
[24:27.230 --> 24:31.030]  measurements than leaving it in and making them go and change the desiccant
[24:31.030 --> 24:37.390]  in the sensor. Because of that we've worked hard. We pot our sensors solid so
[24:37.390 --> 24:43.510]  there's no in the pyranometers there's not airspace so moisture can't get
[24:43.510 --> 24:49.230]  in and cause problems at the measurement. Yes, Ben.
[24:49.230 --> 25:01.990]  A couple things, the fundamental physics of the detector change. Solar panels
[25:01.990 --> 25:07.590]  degrade over time and this is basically a solar panel on a silicon cell that
[25:07.590 --> 25:15.110]  that's becoming less efficient at taking sunlight and making a voltage. Changes in
[25:15.110 --> 25:21.230]  the optical path, tiny changes in deterioration of the diffusing material
[25:21.230 --> 25:26.310]  over it that can become less transparent. Those are the
[25:26.310 --> 25:32.630]  biggest fundamental things. In blackbody pyranometers, it's changes in this black
[25:32.630 --> 25:37.230]  surface. Mark just talked about emissivity. Boy, they work hard to make
[25:37.230 --> 25:43.550]  that emissivity as close to 1.00 as possible, but as that ages it starts to
[25:43.550 --> 25:50.310]  turn gray. If it gets from 1.00 to 0.99, there's a 1% error.
[25:50.310 --> 25:56.470]  It's not fully absorbing the radiation.
[25:56.470 --> 26:03.750]  All sensors have just the fundamental physics of aging of the
[26:03.750 --> 26:10.950]  detector. Solar radiation sensors are particularly subject to drift, aging
[26:10.950 --> 26:14.230]  caused drift.
[26:14.230 --> 26:25.710]  Did you say what happens with artificial light?
[26:25.710 --> 26:27.710]  Yes, do you get any oversampling?
[26:27.710 --> 26:34.990]  You bet you do. These are calibrated for
[26:34.990 --> 26:40.070]  sunlight based on that first slide. Now if you want, and lots of people do
[26:40.070 --> 26:44.470]  this, put them under electric lights which have a very different spectra
[26:44.470 --> 26:51.150]  than sunlight. Silicon pyranometers can be way off with 50%
[26:51.150 --> 26:57.190]  errors under electric lights because of the change in the spectra.
[26:57.190 --> 26:59.190]  What about ones specifically calibrated?
[26:59.190 --> 27:05.710]  Yes, exactly. It's possible to calibrate them and they're fine as long as
[27:05.710 --> 27:10.070]  you don't have a mix of sunlight and electric. They just need to be
[27:10.070 --> 27:15.510]  calibrated against a blackbody pyranometer for that light source and
[27:15.510 --> 27:18.790]  then they're fine because you know the spectra and you can subsample and
[27:18.790 --> 27:25.030]  predict all of it. I want to say one other thing that is not on the list but
[27:25.030 --> 27:35.430]  I'll use this sensor as an example. The cable leading to sensors, different
[27:35.470 --> 27:41.150]  companies use different cables. You've got to get the signal from the sensor to
[27:41.150 --> 27:49.190]  the data logger and higher quality sensors have higher quality cables
[27:49.190 --> 27:54.630]  coming out of them. Usually people write specifications for the cable
[27:54.630 --> 27:58.710]  and the first dead obvious one is you want this thing to be as waterproof as
[27:58.710 --> 28:03.430]  possible so moisture starts to get in this. The signal even though this is
[28:03.430 --> 28:09.950]  perfect it's not getting accurately to the data logger. The other specification
[28:09.950 --> 28:17.590]  that's good to look for in sensors is shielding for electromagnetic radiation
[28:17.590 --> 28:22.270]  and that's just wrapped with tinfoil and grounded at the other end so that you
[28:22.270 --> 28:25.990]  don't get electrical interference inside in greenhouses. This can be a
[28:25.990 --> 28:30.750]  particular problem if they're near fluorescent lights, if they're near equipment,
[28:30.750 --> 28:42.590]  you get electromagnetic noise picked up by the cable so we shield them. That further minimizes any antenna effect of the sensor and so the
[28:42.590 --> 28:48.310]  signal gets cleanly and clearly back to the detector. It's shielded twisted
[28:48.310 --> 28:54.590]  pair cable is the highest quality cable you can get to get the signal back to
[28:54.590 --> 29:04.990]  the detector. In the recent past we used analog sensors. They took an
[29:04.990 --> 29:09.190]  environmental change, they make a voltage, you measure the voltage at the data
[29:09.190 --> 29:14.950]  logger and you convert it to our units that we want. Sensors are rapidly
[29:14.950 --> 29:21.750]  changing to digital sensors. We have microprocessors in the sensors so the
[29:21.750 --> 29:26.750]  measurement is made right in the head of the sensor and a digital signal is
[29:26.750 --> 29:35.030]  sent back to the data logger. All companies are moving to more digital
[29:35.030 --> 29:38.510]  sensors. It changes the nature of the data logger that you measure it with,
[29:38.510 --> 29:46.430]  changes this whole thing because of a digital signal. That's generally a good
[29:46.430 --> 29:51.590]  thing and the cost of that technology is coming down with digital sensors. The
[29:51.590 --> 29:59.630]  three big signals are SDI 12, serial digital interface 12 is common in
[29:59.630 --> 30:10.070]  sensors. Modbus is a second common one and now USB. This one happens to be a USB
[30:10.070 --> 30:15.230]  port, no data logger needed. You buy the sensors and plug it into your laptop and
[30:15.230 --> 30:18.550]  then you use the software and you can show the results on the screen.
[30:18.550 --> 30:27.030]  The interface is changing fast in sensors and the nature of the
[30:27.030 --> 30:33.950]  meter that you use to the sensor is changing because of that. It used to be
[30:33.950 --> 30:37.870]  digital sensors were quite a bit more expensive but now that's much less true.
[30:37.870 --> 30:45.190]  In general, digital sensors are better because of this signal effect.
[30:45.190 --> 30:52.910]  It's easier to send a digital signal over a wire than an analog
[30:52.910 --> 30:58.790]  signal and puts the burden of measurement right in the sensor head.
[30:58.790 --> 31:05.310]  I don't know if you've seen that these options in sensors, it's really just in
[31:05.310 --> 31:10.390]  the last few years that more digital sensors have become available. They're
[31:10.390 --> 31:16.590]  the same sensors, same optics, it's just a little microprocessor in the head.
