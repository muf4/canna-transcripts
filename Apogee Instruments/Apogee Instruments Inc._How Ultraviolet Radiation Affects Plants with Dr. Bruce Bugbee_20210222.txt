[00:00.000 --> 00:07.500]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments and professor of crop physiology at Utah State University.
[00:07.500 --> 00:14.800]  In this short video, we're going to talk just about UV photons and what they do to plants.
[00:14.800 --> 00:22.700]  Apogee makes a couple different sensors for UV. It makes a SU-200, which is just for UV.
[00:23.400 --> 00:27.000]  Some of the extended range now start to measure UV.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  And most importantly for UV is a spectral radiometer.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.800]  And they're more expensive, but if you're really doing UV research, you really need to buy the more expensive instrument.
[00:40.800 --> 00:47.000]  Now, let's take a look at this because it's very confusing to people.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  Here's what we call the electromagnetic spectrum.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  And the two key points are 400 and 700 nanometers.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  And this is visible light and it's been well discussed in previous videos.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  So we'll just draw a box for this.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.500]  Now, as everybody knows, these colors have different effects on plants.
[01:10.500 --> 01:15.000]  They're not all equal, but for photosynthesis, they're close to equal.
[01:16.000 --> 01:25.000]  Suddenly, right at 400, we call this UV light, but the wavelengths of UV are very different.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  And so we give letters to them.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  And let's put UV in blue.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  So if we go to 320.
[01:37.000 --> 01:51.000]  Now, some people say this is 315 nanometers, but the transition right here, this is called UVA.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  And it's just A, the letter A, because it's close to the visible.
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.000]  This radiation is LEDs can produce this UV radiation pretty effectively,
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  but it is much less powerful to a plant than the next group of wavelengths.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  And now I'll show these in blue.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  There's a band right here.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  This is B, UVB radiation.
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.000]  And then finally, we get a band down here, which is UVC.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  So this is pretty much review for people that study UV.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  A is fairly benign.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  B is a lot more powerful.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  And C is really powerful, very damaging.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Let's take a look at two things.
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  How much of these wavelengths are in sunlight, and how do those photons cause sunburn?
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  Because we know that sunburn in people is caused by these.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  So let's take a look at sunlight first.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  I'll put that in yellow.
[03:06.000 --> 03:15.000]  Sunlight starts, this wavelength right here, by the way, is 280.
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  Below 280, we get all of the radiation from the sun is filtered by our atmosphere.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  The sunlight starts here, and if we're going to make a curve for sunlight, it's vanishingly small.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  Get this in yellow here.
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.000]  It's vanishingly small, and then right about 380 starts to go up,
[03:42.000 --> 03:53.340]  and then there's a big jump right at 400, and it curves, starts to look like that sunlight.
[03:53.340 --> 04:01.340]  So this little tiny curve on a graph like this looks like there's hardly anything there,
[04:01.340 --> 04:07.340]  but these photons are hundreds and thousands of times more powerful than these photons.
[04:07.340 --> 04:11.340]  So the trace of radiation here is a very big deal for light.
[04:11.340 --> 04:13.340]  Then it starts to jump up.
[04:13.340 --> 04:15.340]  How about sunburn?
[04:15.340 --> 04:24.340]  We have weighting factors for sunburn, and let's put those in white.
[04:24.340 --> 04:34.340]  The weighting factors for sunburn start very high here, and they look like that.
[04:34.340 --> 04:50.280]  This is called the erythema response curve, and a huge weighting factors.
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.280]  One photon in UVB is equal to a hundred of UVA.
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.280]  It's tremendously powerful for causing sunburn.
[05:00.280 --> 05:07.280]  The glass in greenhouses filters out pretty much all of the UVB.
[05:07.280 --> 05:18.280]  So if you worked all day inside a glass greenhouse, the glass is kind of like SPF 60 in terms of the sunscreen effect.
[05:18.280 --> 05:24.280]  You could get a sunburn inside a greenhouse, but you'd have to be working a long, long time to get it.
[05:24.280 --> 05:29.280]  So these photons are not at all the same big weighting factors,
[05:29.280 --> 05:31.280]  and you can see why you need to know.
[05:31.280 --> 05:39.280]  Are you on this curve? Are you right here on the curve? Are you right there? Are you right there?
[05:39.280 --> 05:41.280]  Enormously different.
[05:41.280 --> 05:44.280]  How does this look for plants?
[05:44.280 --> 05:47.280]  This is the erythema response curve.
[05:47.280 --> 05:56.280]  When we graph this for plants, the curves look really similar to sunburn curves.
[05:56.280 --> 06:01.280]  There's a series of plant growth curves depending on what we're interested in.
[06:01.280 --> 06:07.280]  Some are DNA damage, but they all come down something like this.
[06:07.280 --> 06:14.280]  And the exact shape is important, but they all exponentially decrease.
[06:14.280 --> 06:22.280]  UV is so damaging down here, we want to use it very sparingly.
[06:22.280 --> 06:27.280]  But up here it can have some beneficial effects.
[06:27.280 --> 06:30.280]  It can help make plants tougher.
[06:30.280 --> 06:33.280]  Plants make their own sunscreen.
[06:33.280 --> 06:37.280]  So you give them some UV, they synthesize pigments in the leaves,
[06:37.280 --> 06:40.280]  and they protect themselves against UV photons.
[06:40.280 --> 06:43.280]  So that's a beneficial effect.
[06:43.280 --> 06:50.280]  But these photons in here that are close to the visible light can be beneficial to plants,
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.280]  and we can use them in various ways.
[06:53.280 --> 07:01.280]  Help keep plants short, help make the cuticles thicker, make the layers on the plants thicker.
[07:01.280 --> 07:09.280]  The same thing happens here, but when we get into these, we need to have extremely small doses.
[07:09.280 --> 07:12.280]  We have done research on UVC in our laboratory,
[07:12.280 --> 07:18.280]  and oh my, you only have to turn that on for seconds per day, and you hope you don't burn the plants.
[07:19.280 --> 07:24.280]  The B, we've also studied, and we've burned our share of plants with UVB
[07:24.280 --> 07:27.280]  by turning them on one hour, two hours, three hours a day,
[07:27.280 --> 07:35.280]  and then you start to see burned parts of leaves because the plants couldn't adapt to that much.
[07:35.280 --> 07:41.280]  A is far less powerful, and we can give them a lot more UVA.
[07:41.280 --> 07:47.280]  So all three of these are potentially beneficial depending on the dose.
[07:47.280 --> 07:54.280]  The rule of thumb is some UV is good for people, it's just the right amount,
[07:54.280 --> 07:59.280]  and some UV is good for plants, it's just the right amount.
[08:00.280 --> 08:06.280]  We get so concerned worldwide about skin cancer and sunburn.
[08:06.280 --> 08:09.280]  Everyone's using sunscreen.
[08:09.280 --> 08:14.280]  Guess what? The incidence of vitamin D went up in the population
[08:14.280 --> 08:21.280]  because people were blocking all the UV, and we need UV light, UV photons to synthesize vitamin D.
[08:21.280 --> 08:26.280]  So it's a powerful example of some UV is beneficial for people.
[08:26.280 --> 08:29.280]  It's just not too much. Same thing for plants.
[08:31.280 --> 08:36.280]  The... let's go to one other screen.
[08:36.280 --> 08:39.280]  Can I get to another screen? There.
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.280]  Let's take another screen, and just to get a clean screen.
[08:43.280 --> 08:48.280]  Here's 400, here's 700, same graph.
[08:48.280 --> 08:56.280]  The Apogee makes the meter quantum...
[08:56.280 --> 08:59.280]  Sorry, this is not right.
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.280]  I'm getting the wrong model number on here.
[09:07.280 --> 09:11.280]  This is a visible meter.
[09:11.280 --> 09:16.280]  The sensor UV 200.
[09:16.280 --> 09:24.280]  This is just a UV sensor, and its response curve looks something like this.
[09:24.280 --> 09:27.280]  It gets mostly UV A.
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.280]  It doesn't get any visible, it cuts off in here.
[09:31.280 --> 09:39.280]  This is a useful sensor, but you've got to couple it with what types of UV that it measures.
[09:40.280 --> 09:47.280]  To be able to separately get UV B, UV C, UV A, and all the weighting factors,
[09:47.280 --> 09:52.280]  then you need a spectral radiometer, which is a powerful tool in this.
[09:52.280 --> 09:54.280]  It's just more expensive.
[09:54.280 --> 10:00.280]  So this sensor is good, but it doesn't tell you the exact wavelengths.
[10:00.280 --> 10:07.280]  And of course, the other E PAR sensors now get some of this in here,
[10:07.280 --> 10:13.280]  because this is beneficial radiation right below 400 that causes photosynthesis.
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.280]  So I hope this helps as a summary of UV light in plants.
[10:20.280 --> 10:28.280]  We really need to know the wavelengths to be able to tell whether we can have big doses of a fairly safe wavelength,
[10:28.280 --> 10:32.280]  or tiny doses of a really powerful wavelength.
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.280]  But we have electric lights to give all of these different wavelengths.
[10:37.280 --> 10:45.280]  And we are actively studying these now in my laboratory at the university, these effects of UV.
[10:45.280 --> 10:53.280]  I can tell you our early research is tricky to get the doses just right,
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.280]  because these are damaging wavelengths.
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.280]  But the goal is to use them to improve product quality.
[11:03.280 --> 11:10.280]  One of the things plants do when they get UV photons is make what we call secondary metabolites.
[11:10.280 --> 11:16.280]  Secondary metabolites includes cannabinoids, it includes terpenes, it includes vitamins,
[11:16.280 --> 11:19.280]  a lot of beneficial things for people.
[11:19.280 --> 11:26.280]  So if we can get the doses of UV just right, we have a potential to improve product quality.
[11:26.280 --> 11:30.280]  Thanks for listening. We'll talk to you again in another video.
