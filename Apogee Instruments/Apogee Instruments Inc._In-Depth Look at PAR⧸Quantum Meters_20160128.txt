[00:02.110 --> 00:07.630]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments and this is a series of
[00:07.630 --> 00:13.630]  seminars on principles of environmental measurement. I'm not sure what number
[00:13.630 --> 00:18.510]  we're on but today we're going to talk about photosynthetically active
[00:18.510 --> 00:24.190]  radiation. To me every single component to this is critical to
[00:24.190 --> 00:28.950]  understanding plant growth. This is one that I've been particularly involved
[00:28.950 --> 00:34.510]  with for a long time in my career and I want to give credit to Mark Blomquist
[00:34.510 --> 00:38.630]  who is the chief scientist at Apogee. He and I have worked on this
[00:38.630 --> 00:45.190]  together for more than 10 years refining this measurement and understanding its
[00:45.190 --> 00:52.870]  effects on plant growth. So let's get started with this. The first thing we
[00:52.870 --> 00:58.830]  want to look at is what I consider to be the eight cardinal parameters for
[00:58.830 --> 01:03.430]  plant growth. So what are these eight parameters? Here we have a plant
[01:03.430 --> 01:10.350]  and we always want to show the anatomically correct roots of this plant.
[01:10.350 --> 01:15.790]  Well let's take the below ground parameters. First of all we have
[01:15.790 --> 01:36.250]  nutrients. That's one. Second we have water. Third we have oxygen. Three
[01:36.250 --> 01:40.930]  parameters below ground that are critical to excellent plant growth. How
[01:40.930 --> 01:46.410]  about the ones above ground? Well we have temperature and I'm going to abbreviate
[01:46.410 --> 01:58.560]  that temp. We have humidity. So one, two, three, four, five, not necessarily in order of
[01:58.560 --> 02:14.420]  importance. Carbon dioxide, critical parameter. Seven, wind. We got eight, we're
[02:14.420 --> 02:26.640]  missing one. The elephant in the room is radiation. I'll put that in a giant box
[02:26.640 --> 02:34.600]  up here. We can measure all of these parameters better than the plants can
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.680]  sense them, but in the case of radiation the plant is so exquisitely sensitive to
[02:40.680 --> 02:45.360]  that that our best sensors are only equal to what the plant sees. So I should
[02:45.360 --> 02:52.480]  put some arrows here for radiation coming in and specifically today we're
[02:52.480 --> 02:58.760]  going to talk about photosynthetic radiation, a subset of this. But I put
[02:58.760 --> 03:06.200]  this slide in here to really emphasize how critical it is to do radiation. All
[03:06.200 --> 03:12.080]  of these sensors, we can tell temperature by what's cold, it's warm. We can feel the
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.800]  soil through water. We can tell if it's high humidity. We think we can tell
[03:17.800 --> 03:24.040]  temperature, we can tell radiation, but our eyes are a terrible light meter. Our
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.640]  irises contract when we go out in bright sunlight and we don't realize how bright
[03:29.640 --> 03:36.640]  it is. They come back inside, they expand. We have a very poor ability to tell the
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.120]  amount of light and the result of that is, I'm going to draw another little
[03:41.160 --> 03:47.240]  figure here. Here's our plant outside. Now we get that same plant. It looks like
[03:47.240 --> 03:57.720]  this. Tiny leaves. People say, oh your plant must be low on potassium. It is low
[03:57.720 --> 04:03.760]  on light and anytime you have indoor plants you really need to understand
[04:03.760 --> 04:09.520]  radiation. So I can't emphasize more the importance of really understanding that.
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.720]  So let's take a look at this. Multiple sources of lights to measure plants.
[04:15.720 --> 04:20.880]  We have the Sun here. These are different types of electric lights. High
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.480]  pressure sodium, ceramic, metal, metal hydride, compact fluorescent, all with
[04:26.480 --> 04:31.120]  different colors of light. There's a whole body of studies about what's the
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.040]  right color of light for plants. We're not going to go into that but our research
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.560]  says there's not as much difference as you might think among colors of light.
[04:39.560 --> 04:51.040]  But we're missing one key color on here and that is LEDs, light-emitting diodes.
[04:51.040 --> 04:57.160]  This is a picture of some plant growth chambers with different colors of LEDs.
[04:57.160 --> 05:03.200]  There's a tremendous amount of research going on with colors of LEDs and people
[05:03.200 --> 05:08.440]  are using them for plant growth. So now look at a sensor that has to integrate all
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.040]  these different types of light and accurately predict radiation for plant
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.200]  growth. And that's the focus of this seminar. How do we do that? What are the
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.840]  options for doing that and making accurate measurements of this so we can
[05:21.840 --> 05:24.280]  predict the rate of plant growth?
[05:24.280 --> 05:31.400]  Alright, so a couple of definitions. First, and these are confusing to a lot of
[05:31.400 --> 05:38.000]  people, PAR is photosynthetically active radiation and that just means the
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.920]  radiation that drives photosynthesis. UV light, that's radiation but it doesn't,
[05:44.920 --> 05:50.360]  plants filter that out, it doesn't result in photosynthesis. Near-infrared light
[05:50.360 --> 05:55.560]  doesn't have high enough energy for photosynthesis. This is the radiation for
[05:55.560 --> 06:04.760]  photosynthesis and we'll come back to this again. It's 400 to 700 nanometers.
[06:04.760 --> 06:12.040]  This is close to the visible range as well, what our eyes see. That's the
[06:12.040 --> 06:17.320]  radiation that drives photosynthesis. Alright, second definition. Photosynthetic
[06:17.320 --> 06:24.400]  photon flux or photosynthetic photon flux density. Now these two things
[06:24.720 --> 06:31.400]  refer to the same thing. In the next slide I'll explain the use of these two
[06:31.400 --> 06:37.240]  terms. This is the whole amount of radiation, again between 400 and 700
[06:37.240 --> 06:42.920]  nanometers. So really all of these terms refer to the same thing. They're all this
[06:42.920 --> 06:48.640]  radiation that drives photosynthesis. These terms here are technically a
[06:48.640 --> 06:59.440]  little more exact. PPF and PPFD. We get then to what's a quantum and this
[06:59.440 --> 07:06.200]  gets back to Einstein and quantum physics. A quantum is a mole of photons
[07:06.200 --> 07:12.120]  and this mole is Avogadro's number of photons. So it's these particles coming
[07:12.120 --> 07:19.560]  in and we know from the Stark-Einstein law that one photon excites one electron
[07:19.560 --> 07:23.400]  and that's the first step in photosynthesis. So we're really
[07:23.400 --> 07:28.760]  interested in measuring with these moles of photons and that's what the sensors
[07:28.760 --> 07:35.160]  measure. We'll talk about that in the next slide. But quantum sensor then is a
[07:35.160 --> 07:40.560]  sensor to measure all this stuff. That's when we say quantum sensor we could say
[07:40.560 --> 07:46.400]  a PAR sensor, we could say a PPF sensor, PPFD. They're all the same thing but
[07:46.400 --> 07:51.320]  that's where this word comes from. A quantum sensor or if the sensor is
[07:51.320 --> 07:57.400]  connected to a meter then it's a quantum meter. I'll show you some examples of
[07:57.400 --> 08:07.240]  that. In fact let me show you an example right now. Here is a quantum meter sensor
[08:07.360 --> 08:13.640]  plus the meter and reads out all by itself. You can buy just the sensor and
[08:13.640 --> 08:17.880]  hook it up to a data logger and then it's a quantum sensor. That's all it
[08:17.880 --> 08:25.400]  means between the two of those definitions. Now I want to talk
[08:25.400 --> 08:29.680]  about this issue of flux and I've given myself a nice whiteboard to do this.
[08:29.680 --> 08:40.720]  If we talk to our physicist colleagues, flux has two definitions and you
[08:40.720 --> 08:45.120]  would think by this time in the evolution of science we'd have this term all worked
[08:45.120 --> 08:57.920]  out. One definition is per time and in the case of photosynthesis this would be
[08:58.040 --> 09:08.280]  moles, M-O-L-E-S, per second. That's one definition of flux, moles of photons per
[09:08.280 --> 09:28.750]  second. But equally valid is per area and time together and this means moles per
[09:28.750 --> 09:36.950]  meter squared per second. Even in physics these two things are used
[09:36.950 --> 09:46.990]  interchangeably. If we use this definition per time we would have PPF
[09:46.990 --> 09:50.030]  and then where's the area in here?
[09:50.030 --> 09:56.710]  Oh, we better add D for density to this definition to make sure we've got the
[09:56.710 --> 10:08.030]  area. If we use this definition and we said PPFD, well wait a minute, we've got
[10:08.030 --> 10:15.030]  per area and per area again so this D could be redundant and we wouldn't need
[10:15.030 --> 10:23.230]  it. If you look through the literature on this, half of the people say PPF and the
[10:23.230 --> 10:31.830]  other half say PPFD. The terms are used interchangeably. They mean the exact
[10:31.830 --> 10:36.430]  same thing but it's been confusing to people just as it's confusing to
[10:36.430 --> 10:42.070]  physicists. Is a flux only per unit time or does it mean per unit area and
[10:42.070 --> 10:46.510]  time? There's the difference. For the purposes of this we don't need to worry
[10:46.510 --> 10:53.510]  about it. PPF and PPFD are equal. Now let's go to what we're looking at.
[10:53.510 --> 10:58.750]  Here's photosynthetically active, photosynthetic photon flux, photosynthetic
[10:58.750 --> 11:07.150]  photon flux density. It means radiation between 400 and 700. Sharp cutoffs. Now
[11:07.150 --> 11:11.590]  remember that Stark-Einstein law that you're remembering for the test? Equal
[11:11.590 --> 11:17.270]  weighting of all photons. One photon excites one electron. Every photon coming
[11:17.270 --> 11:23.790]  in up here gets equal weighting on this chart. These are blue down here. This is
[11:23.790 --> 11:32.030]  ultraviolet. This is blue. This is green in the middle and then red and
[11:32.030 --> 11:38.310]  then right after 700 it's infrared IR. Thermal radiation doesn't cause
[11:38.310 --> 11:43.390]  photosynthesis. It's just this here with equal weighting of photons. This is what
[11:43.390 --> 11:49.150]  we're after, a sensor that can get this. Sharp cutoffs on the end so we can
[11:49.150 --> 11:54.430]  predict photosynthesis and plant growth by measuring this. Let's take a
[11:54.430 --> 12:00.870]  look at how we do this. Here is our quantum sensor that we just talked about.
[12:01.030 --> 12:08.510]  Very simple. One detector right here, one filter and one output if we ran it over
[12:08.510 --> 12:15.350]  here to a meter. This is a quantum sensor but this has to be designed with filters
[12:15.350 --> 12:20.350]  to get all of these colors exactly right and that's a tricky business. Very hard
[12:20.350 --> 12:27.030]  to do. If we make the jump to light speed now we have a spectroradiometer and a
[12:27.030 --> 12:32.110]  prism. It breaks up the light and we have lots of arrays down here and this
[12:32.110 --> 12:39.030]  goes off to a meter. This is more accurate. It's also more than 10 times
[12:39.030 --> 12:44.030]  the cost. We're going to look at these, how accurate are these compared to a
[12:44.030 --> 12:48.430]  spectroradiometer and compare them back and forth. This is two options to do this.
[12:48.430 --> 12:54.510]  Quantum sensor, spectroradiometer. Here is what they look like. These are
[12:54.510 --> 13:02.030]  quantum sensors, one from LiCOR, one from Apogee and the Apogee spectroradiometer.
[13:02.030 --> 13:07.510]  A little bigger, a lot more stuff going on in here. If we did
[13:07.510 --> 13:14.630]  x-ray vision we'd have a prism in here. The light comes in, it breaks the light
[13:14.630 --> 13:22.590]  up into multiple detectors down here and these have a single filter. By the
[13:22.590 --> 13:28.750]  way, these are the most widely sold in North America, LiCOR and Apogee. LiCOR
[13:28.750 --> 13:34.230]  came out with a new sensor. They have a better head. It sheds water better now
[13:34.230 --> 13:43.310]  than this one which tended to trap water. It has a nicer cable, has a
[13:43.310 --> 13:47.310]  cable like this. I'll talk about the new sensor and the old sensor.
[13:47.510 --> 13:53.230]  They're both equally accurate. It's just how it sheds water and how rugged it
[13:53.230 --> 14:02.590]  is for outside. There's the comparison. About ten times the cost for this.
[14:02.590 --> 14:06.590]  If you need very accurate measurements this is the instrument of choice but
[14:06.590 --> 14:12.030]  let's talk about how close we can get with these. Here's our box again.
[14:12.030 --> 14:19.710]  Equal weighting of photons. Kip and Zonen is widely sold in Europe. Here's the
[14:19.710 --> 14:27.030]  LiCOR and look at how closely they match this curve. This is really good. Sharp
[14:27.030 --> 14:32.490]  cutoffs because there's multiple colors of light. It's real important to have a
[14:32.490 --> 14:38.990]  sharp cutoff here. These are their two model numbers. The new LiCOR looks
[14:39.070 --> 14:44.190]  a lot like the old LiCOR and it's equally accurate to this. Now let's look
[14:44.190 --> 14:50.830]  at the original Apogee sensor that Apogee has sold for some time. Here's the
[14:50.830 --> 14:57.190]  curve. It comes up a little slow in the blue and look how it cuts off here at
[14:57.190 --> 15:04.430]  about 660. It misses this radiation. That's not serious because it's
[15:04.430 --> 15:10.190]  calibrated to light sources unless you get a light source with a lot of
[15:10.190 --> 15:17.550]  radiation. Now let's take a look at an example of that. LEDs. They come into the
[15:17.550 --> 15:25.270]  picture. This is a red LED and it's called deep red because it's
[15:25.270 --> 15:31.950]  very close to this cutoff. I'm going to put deep red here but this is common in
[15:31.950 --> 15:38.070]  some LEDs and of course this is a blue LED but look at the problem. It cuts off
[15:38.070 --> 15:45.310]  before it can capture that deep red LED. This is an excellent sensor for all
[15:45.310 --> 15:51.110]  types of light sources except when there's a deep red LED in the light
[15:51.110 --> 15:56.830]  source. What can we do about that? Let's take a look. This is the original
[15:56.830 --> 16:08.350]  Apogee. That blue line that we just looked at, Apogee developed a full
[16:08.350 --> 16:23.780]  spectrum quantum sensor. That's this gold line right here that cuts off
[16:23.780 --> 16:29.300]  here. You can see the gold, the green, and the blue lines are all very similar.
[16:29.300 --> 16:36.780]  It comes up better here. If you need to measure red LEDs or LED spectra, this is
[16:36.780 --> 16:43.140]  better than the original but the difference in cost for the full
[16:43.140 --> 16:49.980]  spectrum is about two times as expensive. All of these are quite a bit more
[16:49.980 --> 16:54.780]  expensive than this but if you measure LEDs you need them. Let's take a
[16:54.780 --> 17:02.620]  look at this. Here's the original black sensor. Many people have this. Here's the
[17:02.620 --> 17:07.460]  new one. It's slightly taller, slightly bigger head. Because it's a higher end
[17:07.460 --> 17:11.580]  sensor it's a gold color instead of a black color. That's what the two sensors
[17:11.580 --> 17:16.620]  look like, original and full spectrum. Now let's go back to that graph and here's
[17:16.620 --> 17:21.340]  the difference again right here. Now let's take a close look at the accuracy
[17:21.340 --> 17:27.580]  of all of these sensors and to do that we need to use this fancy integrated
[17:27.580 --> 17:32.380]  method originally developed in 1966 where it takes all the colors of light
[17:32.380 --> 17:38.380]  and it multiplies this by the spectral accuracy of these. This is
[17:38.380 --> 17:44.300]  something that Mark Bonquist has done in great detail for all of these. This is
[17:44.300 --> 17:48.060]  the equation to do it. I'm not going to go into that now except let's look at the
[17:48.060 --> 17:57.980]  results. How close do we get? Kipp and Zonen, LiCOR, and this is also the 190R, is
[17:57.980 --> 18:08.300]  very close to this, and then the original ORIG, Apogee, and the new.
[18:08.300 --> 18:16.940]  I'll put new right here, Apogee. Sunlight and cloudy, these are all tiny errors so
[18:16.940 --> 18:20.260]  you really don't need the full spectrum to be accurate if you're just doing
[18:20.260 --> 18:28.300]  sunlight measurements. Any errors less than certainly 1% are very tiny,
[18:28.300 --> 18:35.260]  even 2% errors are fairly small for these. Now we take cool white
[18:35.260 --> 18:42.060]  fluorescent lights, all these errors less than 2%, this is calibrated
[18:42.060 --> 18:48.620]  here, they're all calibrated to be zero. Small errors, small errors. Now look at
[18:48.620 --> 18:55.620]  the original Apogee. Here's LEDs, red and blue LEDs. Remember it didn't capture
[18:55.620 --> 19:01.220]  that red peak? Big errors. If you're not using it under there it's fine,
[19:01.220 --> 19:05.620]  but if you need these you need full spectrum and we jump to full spectrum
[19:05.620 --> 19:10.500]  everything gets better. Metal halide a little better, high pressure sodium
[19:10.740 --> 19:15.860]  better, but these errors here in particular are small. If you take a
[19:15.860 --> 19:21.580]  close look at this and pause this video and study it you can see that the errors
[19:21.580 --> 19:27.500]  between Kippenzoan and LiCOR and the full spectrum Apogee are all really
[19:27.500 --> 19:34.660]  small under all of these different types of light sources. This one is an asterisk
[19:34.660 --> 19:39.820]  because it has separate calibrations for sun and electric lights. That's explained
[19:39.860 --> 19:44.900]  on the Apogee website. Let's take a look at the next slide here.
[19:44.900 --> 19:54.460]  Spectroradiometer, remember the 10 times big more expensive? It nails every
[19:54.460 --> 20:01.300]  single source. Zero errors because it's measuring every color individually. If
[20:01.300 --> 20:09.420]  you really need excellent accuracy you need a spectroradiometer to do this, but
[20:09.540 --> 20:15.660]  most people if they have two or three percent accuracy that's good enough for
[20:15.660 --> 20:24.940]  their applications. I'm going to conclude on this slide. Apogee also makes a
[20:24.940 --> 20:32.460]  line quantum sensor and it looks like this. When we want to measure radiation
[20:32.460 --> 20:37.820]  underneath the canopy it's really variable. There's bright light and
[20:37.820 --> 20:45.020]  shadows so this sensor averages the light over the whole length of this.
[20:45.020 --> 20:50.180]  If you start to cover some of these it gives you a proportionately reduced
[20:50.180 --> 20:57.540]  reading. This is something that is helpful for people for transmitted light.
[20:57.540 --> 21:04.620]  Of course I have examples here hooked up to meters. I guess I should
[21:04.620 --> 21:13.540]  put them in the same order as this, but the old and the new sensors. Again the
[21:13.540 --> 21:19.300]  new one is full spectrum and more accurate under all the different colors
[21:19.300 --> 21:25.500]  of light. I hope this overview of some terminology and some differences among
[21:25.500 --> 21:31.740]  meters is helpful to understand and make more accurate measurements of
[21:32.220 --> 21:39.660]  photosynthetically active radiation. I look forward to another session on other
[21:39.660 --> 21:42.780]  topics in environmental biophysics. Thanks for listening.
