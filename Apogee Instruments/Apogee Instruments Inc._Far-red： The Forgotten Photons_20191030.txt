[00:00.700 --> 00:06.620]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, professor of crop physiology at Utah State University and
[00:06.620 --> 00:12.940]  also president of Apogee Instruments. I'm here today at the Apogee Instruments
[00:12.940 --> 00:22.500]  studio to talk about our recent research on far-red photon effects on plant
[00:22.500 --> 00:30.140]  growth and development. This is a emerging field that's red-hot right now.
[00:30.140 --> 00:37.780]  Companies are putting far-red LEDs into fixtures and it's based on our work and
[00:37.780 --> 00:42.860]  that of some other laboratories that have clearly shown some value of far-red.
[00:42.860 --> 00:51.620]  So in this seminar I'm calling this far-red the forgotten photons. We can't
[00:51.620 --> 00:58.060]  see them. They're barely visible to the human eye and yet they have powerful
[00:58.060 --> 01:03.380]  effects on plant growth that we're just discovering. We missed these effects for
[01:03.380 --> 01:08.500]  so many years because electric lights don't have far-red. There's no reason to
[01:08.500 --> 01:14.060]  put them in there. Sunlight is loaded with far-red photons but it wasn't until
[01:15.020 --> 01:23.620]  we got LEDs and especially a far-red LED that's very efficient that can be added
[01:23.620 --> 01:30.060]  to electric lights. So this work is both fascinating from the standpoint of
[01:30.060 --> 01:36.100]  fundamental photobiology and also has immediate significant commercial
[01:36.100 --> 01:43.460]  implications because we can manipulate both photosynthesis and plant shape with
[01:43.580 --> 01:49.820]  these far-red photons. So I'd love to show this prism breaking up the colors of
[01:49.820 --> 01:55.300]  light. Those of you know Pink Floyd, you know where this came from. So the far-red,
[01:55.300 --> 02:01.460]  I like to show this. It's right on this edge right here of just the edge of
[02:01.460 --> 02:06.340]  visible light and that's what we're going to talk about in this. I want to
[02:06.340 --> 02:11.460]  acknowledge two of my colleagues that have done this research. They're in the
[02:11.460 --> 02:16.060]  trenches day-to-day making the measurements and we meet every single
[02:16.060 --> 02:21.060]  day, discuss the data, what the next studies we're going to do. The first one
[02:21.060 --> 02:27.180]  is Shu-Yung Zhen who started as a postdoc. She's now a research scientist in
[02:27.180 --> 02:33.620]  the lab. She has done the measurements on photosynthesis and especially canopy
[02:33.620 --> 02:38.580]  photosynthesis. And then also Paul Kusuma who came to us from the University of
[02:38.620 --> 02:46.180]  Florida, Kevin Foltis lab there. He's done the research on plant shape from far-red
[02:46.180 --> 02:54.140]  photons. Our work has been funded primarily by NASA. They've funded the
[02:54.140 --> 02:59.060]  lab for over 30 years for some very basic studies and now more recently the
[02:59.060 --> 03:04.460]  USDA has funded our research through what's called the LAMP project, Lighting
[03:04.540 --> 03:10.700]  Approaches to Maximize Profits. Basic funding agency, applied funding agency,
[03:10.700 --> 03:15.700]  and the interaction between those has really helped us understand the value of
[03:15.700 --> 03:22.620]  far-red photons. Let me show you another graph of where the far-red photons lie.
[03:22.620 --> 03:29.100]  Here's the colors of light all the way from blue to far-red and you can see,
[03:29.260 --> 03:35.700]  let's put some dotted lines on here, the cutoffs. Now our traditional definition
[03:35.700 --> 03:43.700]  of photosynthesis doesn't start counting photons until, let's get some black, until
[03:43.700 --> 03:48.540]  right here. Right at 400 we start counting them. We have evidence these
[03:48.540 --> 03:53.380]  photons are useful too but for now we're going to talk about just the far-red. So
[03:53.540 --> 03:59.060]  here on the edge of our vision we're talking about these photons right in
[03:59.060 --> 04:05.380]  this area right here. What's the effect on plant growth? Just to review, we
[04:05.380 --> 04:20.240]  typically break up light into three categories. Blue, green, and red. And I'll
[04:20.240 --> 04:23.760]  be talking about the effects of those. It turns out this is, these are 100
[04:23.760 --> 04:28.920]  nanometer increments, but it really works well to break them up into this.
[04:28.920 --> 04:34.960]  We're currently studying different wavings of blue, but the green, look
[04:34.960 --> 04:38.400]  at the green includes yellow transitioning to orange. We call that
[04:38.400 --> 04:43.080]  whole thing green. But it turns out it works really well to break the light up
[04:43.080 --> 04:49.320]  into this. So what I'm going to start with is a story. And it's a story of a
[04:49.320 --> 04:55.160]  study that Shu Yong did with four growth chambers where we did canopy
[04:55.160 --> 04:59.360]  photosynthesis on the plants and gave them different colors of light. So let's
[04:59.360 --> 05:05.520]  go to that story. Here's the four chambers. Two of them had white light
[05:05.520 --> 05:15.320]  from white LEDs. Two of them had magenta or purple light from red and blue LEDs.
[05:15.320 --> 05:26.040]  Here is the input of photons to each. 300, 350, 300, 350. So if we looked at this
[05:26.040 --> 05:34.600]  chart without prior knowledge of far-red photons, how would you say the lettuce
[05:34.600 --> 05:39.200]  grew? This is a study with lettuce. The first thing you'd say, let's see if we
[05:39.200 --> 05:47.760]  can show this in red, is that these, by virtue of having higher light, would have
[05:47.760 --> 05:55.680]  higher yield. And these would be less. And if you were a believer in red and blue
[05:55.680 --> 06:01.960]  photons for photosynthesis, you would say that this would grow the best, and this
[06:01.960 --> 06:07.720]  would be second, and these would be third, and fourth. Now let's look how the data
[06:07.840 --> 06:16.760]  comes out for this. These two were exactly equal. Now I've normalized the
[06:16.760 --> 06:21.240]  fresh weight and the dry weight to a hundred for these to make the point.
[06:21.240 --> 06:28.800]  There was no difference in growth when we went from purple or magenta light to
[06:28.800 --> 06:33.400]  white light. That should not be a surprise because now we know that green
[06:33.400 --> 06:39.280]  photons are just as good as any other color for photosynthesis. And I'm going to
[06:39.280 --> 06:47.040]  discuss that more in a bit. Let's take a look just at those two chambers and
[06:47.040 --> 06:54.560]  the difference. These two chambers grew even better in this experiment. So
[06:54.560 --> 07:01.160]  suddenly, look at the difference. 27% better, 35% better. This is just opposite
[07:01.320 --> 07:05.640]  of our intuition where we thought this would be the best and this would be the
[07:05.640 --> 07:12.000]  worst. It's completely flipped. Let's take a look at what's going on here. Is there
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.920]  a mechanism for why this should be the best and grew better than that?
[07:16.920 --> 07:25.200]  What I didn't tell you is that these two chambers had 50 micromoles per meter
[07:25.200 --> 07:32.920]  squared per second of far-red photons. That's a big deal. So 350, 300 plus 50,
[07:32.920 --> 07:42.480]  this got 350. The total here is 350. All four chambers had the exact same photon
[07:42.480 --> 07:50.080]  flux if you count the far-red photons. So what's up with that? Do far-red photons
[07:50.080 --> 07:55.480]  cause photosynthesis? Let's take a look at this. First, let's take a look at these
[07:55.480 --> 08:02.040]  two chambers. Is this right? Do white lights grow plants equally well to
[08:02.040 --> 08:07.040]  magenta lights? We have a long history of now of people saying pink houses with
[08:07.040 --> 08:12.480]  this blue. People say this is a plant growth light. This is not efficient for
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.880]  photosynthesis because the green photons just bounce off. Let's take a look at
[08:16.880 --> 08:27.800]  that. This is a 2002 edition of the plant physiology book that I use in
[08:27.800 --> 08:36.480]  class. What does this book say about red and blue and green light? 2002, that's 17
[08:36.480 --> 08:42.440]  years ago. Here's the graph. Here's what it says. This is absorption of chlorophyll.
[08:42.440 --> 08:48.360]  Really strong absorption in blue. Less in the green. Strong absorption in the red.
[08:48.360 --> 08:53.880]  It says chlorophyll absorbs minimum green light. That's a true statement and that
[08:53.880 --> 08:58.040]  resulted in people making lights with just red and blue because of this
[08:58.040 --> 09:05.600]  powerful absorption by chlorophyll. But sunlight is loaded with green light. Is
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.720]  that really wasted? Let's jump ahead to the 2015 version of this book, which is
[09:12.720 --> 09:18.920]  the current version. This is Thies and Zeiger. Now it's on the sixth edition. Now we
[09:18.920 --> 09:24.400]  turn to the exact same page of chlorophyll. Look at this graph. There's
[09:24.400 --> 09:30.280]  new pigments in here. Now it says multiple pigments absorb radiation from
[09:30.280 --> 09:35.280]  400 to 700. Now this is still a little misleading because this pigment,
[09:35.280 --> 09:41.040]  phycorethrin, is only found in algae. But the chlorophyll absorption, even though
[09:41.040 --> 09:46.800]  it's low in here on this graph, is enough to penetrate the leaves and cause
[09:46.800 --> 09:54.720]  excellent photosynthesis. So what I'd like to show you briefly is the effects of
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.880]  these colors of light. This summarizes a big part of my career to categorize these.
[10:00.880 --> 10:06.400]  Remember we got blue, green, red, and now far red. Summary of spectral effects. Here's our
[10:06.400 --> 10:14.480]  dark side of the moon spectra. Blue photons inhibit cell expansion. That
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.360]  sounds terrible, but when it's stem elongation, it's a good thing. More blue,
[10:19.360 --> 10:27.400]  shorter plants. And that's tremendous. Now if it's smaller leaves, that's bad. But
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.320]  that's the most fundamental effect of blue photons is to inhibit stem
[10:33.320 --> 10:39.800]  elongation, but they also inhibit leaf expansion. Green are far more valuable
[10:39.800 --> 10:44.280]  than we once thought because they are very effective for photosynthesis and
[10:44.280 --> 10:52.360]  they facilitate human vision. Let's go to this slide right here. This is cannabis
[10:52.360 --> 11:00.560]  grown under red and blue LEDs and white LEDs. Our experience working in the lab
[11:00.560 --> 11:05.680]  is that these are tremendously valuable for diagnosing the plants. Get in there
[11:05.680 --> 11:11.120]  to see microscopic insects, subtle nutritional disorders. They penetrate
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.760]  deep in the canopy. We can see these dark areas. This is very difficult to
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.200]  understand the health of the plants. Now you can turn those off and turn on
[11:22.200 --> 11:27.600]  whites, but you don't see surgeons working under dim white light. They have
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.760]  bright white light and we have found that really helps diagnose subtle
[11:32.760 --> 11:40.320]  disorders on the plants. This is still slightly more efficient electrically,
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.560]  but the difference is getting smaller. This is maybe 10% more
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.880]  electrically efficient than this, but this has the clear advantage for being
[11:50.880 --> 11:57.080]  able to diagnose the plants. This is a little sidebar from our quest to
[11:57.080 --> 12:04.080]  understand far-red photons, but it's an important sidebar. Back to this. Inhibit
[12:04.080 --> 12:11.880]  cell expansion. Look at far-red photons. Wow. They do the opposite of blue. They
[12:11.880 --> 12:18.840]  enhance cell expansion and that effect is so powerful. Here's LED lettuce
[12:18.840 --> 12:25.400]  with white light, with no far-red, and with 10% far-red. Now I just jumped ahead
[12:25.400 --> 12:31.680]  of myself to show you what's going on in our study with those far-red photons, but
[12:31.680 --> 12:37.040]  this enhancement of cell expansion is a very big thing. It's a very powerful tool.
[12:37.040 --> 12:43.200]  Look at how well photons penetrate leaves. This is a beautiful study by
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.200]  Brodessen and Volgoman, 2010. They looked at a side view of a leaf. Here's blue.
[12:49.200 --> 12:53.600]  There's so much absorption by chlorophyll it doesn't penetrate. Here's
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.640]  green. Penetrates the whole leaf. There's the top of the leaf. Let me get a green
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.480]  color here. There's the top of the leaf right there. Here's the bottom of the leaf.
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.160]  Green beautifully penetrates the leaf through the spongy mesophyll all the way
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.600]  through the leaf. That's a big value of green light. Red, similar to blue. Absorbed
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.440]  by chlorophyll, absorbed in the top layers. Look at far-red. That also penetrates the
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.000]  leaf. So these effects only become apparent when we study whole plants and
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.560]  especially plant communities. But this is a nice slide showing the penetrating
[13:29.560 --> 13:37.600]  effects of these colors of light. Back to our study. Better growth here. Better
[13:37.600 --> 13:45.360]  growth here. What caused that better growth? When we get a result like this,
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.000]  that's sort of unbelievable because if these don't cause photosynthesis, what's
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.880]  going on, we need to know the mechanism. And this, by the way, this is fresh mass
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.840]  and dry mass both in this study. We very carefully measure this. We've done it
[14:02.840 --> 14:10.440]  more than once. We get the same result. Now let's go back to Carl Sagan who
[14:10.440 --> 14:15.960]  popularized a phrase that I think all of us would be good to remember when we're
[14:15.960 --> 14:24.600]  doing these studies. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. With
[14:24.600 --> 14:30.520]  far-red enhances lettuce growth, we need extraordinary proof to begin to
[14:30.520 --> 14:39.480]  understand it. So this comes from, first of all, the McCree curve. Here's a picture
[14:39.480 --> 14:47.920]  of Keith McCree. He died five years ago. Here's his famous curve. Here's 700. And in
[14:47.920 --> 14:53.040]  the McCree curve, he shows these cutting off so fast that these photons are of
[14:53.040 --> 15:00.320]  minimal value. But as terrific as a scientist as McCree was, and I got to
[15:00.320 --> 15:05.960]  know him personally early in my career, he was a physicist that came across to
[15:05.960 --> 15:14.960]  help biology, he was a great guy. He only had primitive tools to make this curve.
[15:14.960 --> 15:22.440]  He didn't have the LEDs we have now. He had prisms and filters. So we had low
[15:22.440 --> 15:28.280]  light levels and he only could study one color at a time and on a single leaf.
[15:28.280 --> 15:34.920]  It's a terrific piece of work and his papers are a masterpiece of writing, but
[15:34.920 --> 15:40.520]  they're limited because he couldn't study synergistic effects of multiple
[15:40.520 --> 15:47.920]  colors of light at once on the leaf. So let's look at what happens. There's our
[15:47.920 --> 15:58.560]  far-red. This is a diagram of what happens with photons flowing through the
[15:58.560 --> 16:03.640]  light reactions of photosynthesis. Now usually this is shown with a lot of
[16:03.640 --> 16:13.880]  biochemistry, but I really like physical diagrams. So here's a person, it's a man-wife
[16:13.880 --> 16:21.520]  team I guess, moving photons through what we call photosystem I and photosystem II.
[16:21.520 --> 16:31.280]  They first come in. It takes four photons to excite these four electrons to a
[16:31.280 --> 16:36.800]  higher energy state. This is where water is split in photosynthesis. Now they get
[16:36.800 --> 16:44.240]  this photon, roll it down this platform, and this mill turns and it makes ATP. So
[16:44.240 --> 16:51.320]  that's the first step, really valuable. Now they get to another platform and we
[16:51.320 --> 16:57.720]  need four more photons to excite four electrons up here to this guy. There's
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.760]  four electrons in a very high state and now we put them in a bucket and this
[17:02.760 --> 17:10.080]  makes NADPH. So the combination of ATP and NADPH, very high energy compounds, are
[17:10.080 --> 17:14.880]  what causes photosynthesis. Interestingly enough, because of the way we discovered
[17:14.880 --> 17:21.480]  these, photosystem II comes first and then photosystem I. That's a trick
[17:21.480 --> 17:27.560]  question for students on plant physiology exams. Two comes first. However,
[17:27.560 --> 17:36.520]  we have known since the 1950s and the time of Emerson that far-red photons
[17:36.520 --> 17:44.000]  also are effective right here. And in fact that work helped us understand
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.560]  there's two photosystems. So the far-red photons can substitute for the
[17:50.640 --> 17:58.040]  traditionally photosynthetic photons here, but only if we have, we'll call it
[17:58.040 --> 18:02.920]  white light photons on this side. Far-red photons all by themselves are not
[18:02.920 --> 18:09.440]  effective. We know that, but it's easy to give far-red photons synergistically
[18:09.440 --> 18:15.480]  with all the rest of the photons. So this is a nice easy to remember diagram of
[18:15.520 --> 18:21.160]  how photons turn into energy and then all this energy is used to fix CO2 into
[18:21.160 --> 18:27.920]  sucrose in plants. But the point is far-red photons. Now there's a very
[18:27.920 --> 18:34.160]  fundamental law that underlies all of this and this law relates not only to
[18:34.160 --> 18:40.120]  photosynthesis, but it relates to solar panels and for that matter it relates to
[18:40.120 --> 18:47.120]  human vision in our the retina of our eyes. And that law, this is the Emerson
[18:47.120 --> 18:55.600]  enhancement effect, this law is called the Stark-Einstein law. Stark
[18:55.600 --> 19:00.520]  helped explain Einstein's work. They both get credit for it and here it is. One
[19:00.520 --> 19:07.760]  photon excites one electron. A simple law. We have four photons here. We get four
[19:07.800 --> 19:14.160]  electrons here. Four more photons here. We get four more electrons up there. That's
[19:14.160 --> 19:20.200]  a remarkable law and it links the photosynthetic value of photons to human
[19:20.200 --> 19:26.320]  vision and to solar cells and really all of biology. This is how the system works
[19:26.320 --> 19:32.080]  and this is why far-red photons can act synergistically with white. Now let's
[19:32.120 --> 19:39.720]  take a closer look at this. Is our definition of photosynthetic photons
[19:39.720 --> 19:45.360]  correct? To do this work we put lettuce in those gas exchange chambers that I
[19:45.360 --> 19:50.800]  talked about and gave them supplemental far-red light. This is just exactly how
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.760]  we did the study we're talking about. Here's the traditional photons. Here's
[19:55.760 --> 20:00.720]  the far-red right there. We normally wouldn't count them for photosynthesis.
[20:00.760 --> 20:09.880]  What happened? This is 400 to 700. There's the far-red. When we gave them only white
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.960]  light we get this kind of curve for photosynthesis. This is gross
[20:13.960 --> 20:20.160]  photosynthesis. A curve that's slightly nonlinear because we're getting up to
[20:20.160 --> 20:25.200]  high light levels. Now we start adding far-red photons to this. What happens?
[20:25.640 --> 20:32.440]  Look at this. They go up. We're not counting them but they made photosynthesis
[20:32.440 --> 20:37.240]  go up and we're not counting them as photosynthetic. How do you explain
[20:37.240 --> 20:44.280]  that? We need another graph. Here is the graph where we count photons all the way
[20:44.280 --> 20:52.320]  to 750 and now those photons fall perfectly on the line. This is powerful
[20:52.440 --> 20:58.840]  evidence that our definition of photosynthetic photons needs revision to
[20:58.840 --> 21:05.520]  count far-red photons, particularly in canopy photosynthesis where they
[21:05.520 --> 21:10.080]  penetrate the canopy and they have a bigger effect than they might have in a
[21:10.080 --> 21:19.080]  single leaf. Let's take a look now at does this happen in all species. Remember
[21:19.080 --> 21:24.440]  we want convincing evidence. We want extraordinary proof. Maybe that only
[21:24.440 --> 21:31.080]  works in lettuce. Shu Yong Zhen has now done this in something like 20 species,
[21:31.080 --> 21:37.160]  spinach, basil, kale, different kinds of lettuce, C4 crops like corn, sunflower,
[21:37.160 --> 21:44.760]  wheat. It happens the same in every species. Every single species those far-red
[21:44.760 --> 21:51.160]  photons are equally valuable to traditionally photosynthetic photons.
[21:52.920 --> 21:59.640]  Here's the commercial implications. We did a paper end of last year. It got
[21:59.640 --> 22:05.880]  published in the journal Nature. Most people show the flux of photons like
[22:05.880 --> 22:13.800]  this in an energy basis. And here's far-red right here. Not very good. But
[22:14.040 --> 22:19.640]  energy doesn't cause photosynthesis. Energy doesn't cause plant shape. It's
[22:19.640 --> 22:26.760]  photons. And these are low energy photons. So when we take this data and re-graph it
[22:26.760 --> 22:33.800]  for photon flux, look at this. The far-red photons are almost equal to the reds and
[22:33.800 --> 22:38.120]  the blues. These violets are coming on fast too. That's a subject of another
[22:38.120 --> 22:42.920]  talk. But the far-red photons are very effective. So now we can use those
[22:42.920 --> 22:46.760]  commercially. Not only can we use them for photobiology, but we can use them
[22:46.760 --> 22:52.840]  commercially to manipulate plants. Back to the study. Now this shows, if they're
[22:52.840 --> 22:57.960]  photosynthetic, this shows why these should all be equal because they cause
[22:57.960 --> 23:02.440]  photosynthesis. But they weren't equal. These two are even better than those two.
[23:03.480 --> 23:12.120]  This gets us in to plant shape. This is Paul Kasuma's work now. And this is the
[23:12.120 --> 23:18.680]  response of plants to shade. When the plants are in the bright sun, they have
[23:20.280 --> 23:26.280]  plenty of visible photons. Blue, green, and red. They know they're in the sun. But when
[23:26.280 --> 23:35.080]  they're in the shade, over here underneath this tree, they have a lot of far-red photons.
[23:35.080 --> 23:41.480]  This is the graph of the shade. They're very enriched. When plants perceive a high amount
[23:41.480 --> 23:48.520]  of far-red, they panic. We're under shade. They need to do one of two things. Get tall
[23:48.520 --> 23:56.200]  fast to get into the light, or get bigger to capture more light. So there's two types of
[23:56.200 --> 24:03.800]  plants. Here they come. One's growing fast. This is called a shade avoider plant because
[24:03.800 --> 24:09.640]  it's getting tall. This plant is called a shade tolerator plant because it's getting big.
[24:10.600 --> 24:16.280]  If we can trick plants that are not in the shade to think that, we could make them like this. This
[24:16.280 --> 24:23.560]  is a traditional plant in the sun. This is exactly what happens with lettuce. That the lettuce gets
[24:23.560 --> 24:31.400]  big like this because of it being tricked by far-red photons. Let's take a look at this.
[24:32.040 --> 24:34.360]  Shade avoidance, shade tolerance.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.760]  There's a big picture of that lettuce and the value of far-red. This was with just a little
[24:44.760 --> 24:51.000]  bit more far-red. We tricked this lettuce plant into thinking it was in the shade. It got enormous.
[24:51.960 --> 24:59.800]  This is a powerful picture. We're all anxious to use far-red for indoor agriculture on lettuce to
[24:59.800 --> 25:07.080]  get the plants bigger. Many people have said this is incredible. We need to be giving far-red
[25:07.080 --> 25:20.600]  to everything. But remember that far-red also increases stem elongation. Some plants could be
[25:21.560 --> 25:30.920]  shade avoiders. Let's look at the results from multiple species. Here's a top view of these
[25:30.920 --> 25:38.040]  plants. No far-red, far-red. It's the same slide as the last one. It only shows you the dramatic
[25:38.040 --> 25:44.200]  benefit of far-red photons. Both because of photosynthesis and because of expansion. But look,
[25:45.160 --> 25:50.360]  the photosynthetic photons were less. So we needed those for photosynthesis,
[25:50.360 --> 25:57.640]  but they not only grew equally, they grew better. Here's the problem. We give the same amount of
[25:57.640 --> 26:04.680]  far-red photons to tomatoes. Look what happens. More stem elongation. This is very undesirable
[26:04.680 --> 26:10.040]  in tomatoes. I know we don't grow soybeans in controlled environments, but they're a great
[26:10.040 --> 26:17.400]  test species. It made soybeans panic. They get tall. This is not a good effect. Cucumbers. Makes
[26:17.400 --> 26:23.000]  cucumbers tall. This is not a good effect. Spinach. We have some evidence as leafy greens. This can
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.800]  help with leaf expansion in spinach too. So for leafy greens, the addition of far-red is great.
[26:30.840 --> 26:36.520]  But it's a powerful tool because we could use it a little bit when the plants are young. We can
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.640]  use it at different times. Look at this flower right there. Let me see if I can highlight this.
[26:42.760 --> 26:50.120]  We'll put that one in red. There's evidence that far-red light can help plants flower sooner.
[26:51.080 --> 26:58.840]  So I hope this seminar has helped explain from our results the tremendous value of far-red photons.
[26:59.480 --> 27:08.200]  So historically, we have quantum sensors to measure photosynthetic photons, but those quantum sensors
[27:08.200 --> 27:15.240]  don't measure this far-red. In order to measure it, you need a spectral radiometer, which is terrific,
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.480]  but that jumps up the price and complexity considerably in making those measurements.
[27:22.280 --> 27:31.880]  Because of this, Apogee has developed a sensor that has both red and far-red detectors
[27:31.880 --> 27:41.080]  in the same sensor. So this helps us measure traditionally photosynthetic photons and in a
[27:41.080 --> 27:50.200]  separate measurement, far-red photons. That's it. Thanks for listening. We'll talk to you again in
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.880]  another video.
