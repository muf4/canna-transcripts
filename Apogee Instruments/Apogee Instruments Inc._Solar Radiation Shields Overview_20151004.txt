[00:01.920 --> 00:09.840]  I'm Bruce Bugbee and this is a continuing series of seminars on principles of
[00:09.840 --> 00:15.720]  environmental measurement. In this next mini seminar we're going to talk about
[00:15.720 --> 00:22.400]  radiation shields. How do you protect a sensor from solar radiation to shade it
[00:22.400 --> 00:27.560]  to get it to more accurately measure true air temperature. Now this is
[00:27.560 --> 00:31.880]  something like many things that we thought we knew how to do ten years ago
[00:31.880 --> 00:36.160]  and we start to do more rigorous tests and we start to find out the things we
[00:36.160 --> 00:41.800]  don't know. So we're going to talk about the past eight years of research on
[00:41.800 --> 00:47.400]  radiation shields and how we've modified shields and come up with a new type of
[00:47.400 --> 00:53.520]  shield that uses less power and is more accurate than the traditional things. I'm
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.640]  joined in this effort by Mark Blonquist, the chief scientist at Apogee. He and I
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.480]  have been doing tests on this in many places over a lot of time to get this
[01:02.480 --> 01:09.800]  data. So let's take a look at the types of shields. Now here's a great picture of
[01:09.800 --> 01:16.520]  these shields against the sky and it summarizes the five types of shields I'm
[01:16.520 --> 01:20.960]  going to talk about in here. This is at an angle so there's a little bit of
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.960]  wide-angle distortion here but let's go through them. Here's the shields that
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.640]  everybody is familiar with. We call these multi-plate shields. They're also called
[01:31.640 --> 01:37.800]  passive shields or static shields. There's no moving parts. They rely on the
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.120]  wind to cool it off. The wind is supposed to go through them and it's supposed to shade
[01:43.120 --> 01:49.040]  the sun. They've been used on hundreds of thousands of weather stations over many
[01:49.040 --> 01:54.720]  decades. Now let's look at how accurate they are compared to improvements. There's
[01:54.720 --> 02:01.320]  one type, this is one made by MetSpec in England. Here's a second type right here
[02:01.320 --> 02:07.360]  which is made by RM Young. These come in multiple heights. We used ones that are
[02:07.360 --> 02:15.040]  tall so the very best of this technology but we compared it to three active
[02:15.040 --> 02:21.160]  shields that have a fan in them. It's pretty simple. If you have a fan blowing
[02:21.160 --> 02:26.800]  over something it doesn't heat up in the sun the way a static shield does. So as
[02:26.800 --> 02:33.960]  you can imagine if the sun is bright and the wind is not blowing these heat up
[02:33.960 --> 02:40.880]  above air temperature and with the fan the problem is greatly diminished. So in
[02:40.880 --> 02:47.760]  this series of tests I'm going to show you we looked at the Met One shield which is a
[02:47.760 --> 02:53.560]  long tube. It's actually the biggest of the three shields and the inlet to the
[02:53.560 --> 02:58.480]  air comes in the bottom right there and then the outlet of the air comes out the
[02:58.480 --> 03:06.320]  top up here. The second shield we looked at is the RM Young shield. Again the air is
[03:06.320 --> 03:13.720]  coming in the bottom blowing out the top and the third shield we looked at is
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.160]  an Apogee fan aspirated shield. Same thing, air is coming in the bottom and out the
[03:20.160 --> 03:23.520]  top. So we'll look at the data and then we'll look at some of the physical
[03:23.520 --> 03:30.480]  principles that result in air temperature. So after years of work and
[03:30.480 --> 03:35.360]  refining that design the next step is field testing and we've tested these now
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.320]  in multiple locations. So before I show you the data let's look at the locations.
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.720]  One of the first test sites is at Campbell Scientific here in Logan, Utah
[03:45.720 --> 03:50.840]  and here's the multiple replicate shields you can see on this screen.
[03:50.840 --> 03:57.080]  Met spec shields, small multi plates, big multi plates. Here's the Apogee shield
[03:57.080 --> 04:03.440]  right there. Here's an RM Young shield there compared to all these other shields.
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.320]  Here's the anemometer for wind speed. So this is one of the test sites run over
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.880]  an extended period of time to look at differences in measurement accuracy
[04:13.880 --> 04:19.040]  caused by shields. These all have accurate temperature sensors inside them
[04:19.040 --> 04:28.000]  to make this a fair comparison. Next site is Apogee's backyard which is a more
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.640]  extensive test. You can see all these along a plane. Here's replicate Apogee
[04:32.680 --> 04:40.040]  shields. There's many of them. Here's the Met One shield. Here's the RM Young shield.
[04:40.040 --> 04:44.760]  There's many replicate shields in this. This is in a line but we filtered the
[04:44.760 --> 04:51.000]  data for only when it was crosswinds to get more precise data out of this test.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.640]  All run off a single weather station. It's an example of some of the testing we've done.
[04:55.640 --> 05:01.840]  Third site is Campbell Scientific England. Same thing. Here's the RM Young.
[05:02.240 --> 05:08.360]  Here's the Apogee. Whole bunch of static shields in this test all hooked up to a
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.520]  common data logger run over a long period of time to test for differences
[05:12.520 --> 05:18.600]  among shields. Another site is the Utah State University campus environmental
[05:18.600 --> 05:22.800]  observatory which is a solar-powered station right in the middle of campus.
[05:22.800 --> 05:27.640]  Here's a static shield and here's an Apogee shield in comparison.
[05:28.360 --> 05:35.320]  Typically we have the inlets of these at the exact same height. They're not quite
[05:35.320 --> 05:40.240]  that way here because the ground is warm and the higher you go the cooler it is.
[05:40.240 --> 05:46.360]  So this test would slightly favor the static shield over this because this is
[05:46.360 --> 05:51.240]  lower and this is higher. But typically in all the other tests the inlets were
[05:51.240 --> 05:57.160]  at the exact same height. Now let's look at some of the data from these tests.
[05:57.160 --> 06:02.920]  We're going to summarize a lot of data in a few slides. Here's the raw data. These two
[06:02.920 --> 06:08.040]  slides. Here's the summarized data. So let's look at the summarized data first
[06:08.040 --> 06:16.120]  without all these data points in it. This is the temperature rise above the active
[06:16.120 --> 06:22.200]  radiation shield. Now all three of the active shields were very close to each
[06:22.320 --> 06:29.560]  other. So they're very close to zero. And if the wind is blowing, now let's look at
[06:29.560 --> 06:36.400]  two things. Here's a small thermistor right here, the blue line. Here is a
[06:36.400 --> 06:41.440]  larger humidity probe. How do people measure temperature in these? A humidity
[06:41.440 --> 06:50.080]  probe. So if you have a larger humidity probe you can have 1 degree C errors in
[06:50.080 --> 06:57.880]  still wind. If the sun is out, if the wind is three meters a second, a gentle
[06:57.880 --> 07:05.720]  breeze, you still have, you can see about 0.3 degree C error, all the way up to a
[07:05.720 --> 07:11.680]  rigorous breeze. Flags would be standing straight out at wind speeds like this.
[07:12.280 --> 07:21.120]  The humidity probe still didn't get quite to zero. So the small thermistor was
[07:21.120 --> 07:29.600]  better. Let's see here if we can erase some of this. This is our new board. It's just like a
[07:29.600 --> 07:39.000]  blackboard, only no chalk. So now we go to this, get back to green. Now let's look at
[07:39.120 --> 07:44.160]  this small thermistor. Much better because it's small. This is a tiny yellow bead
[07:44.160 --> 07:52.160]  thermistor made by Apogee Instruments. Very tiny. At three meters a second, now the error
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.680]  gets less than a tenth of a degree C, but it's a pretty big error below that. And
[07:56.680 --> 08:03.000]  finally this gets very close to zero out here at high wind speeds. This is just
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.640]  the raw data because these are short time intervals. There's little puffs of
[08:07.640 --> 08:14.800]  wind, but the key is that summary there. Small thermistors are more accurate than
[08:14.800 --> 08:19.640]  larger humidity sensors and we'll get back to that, but that's a key
[08:19.640 --> 08:26.040]  distinction because people often just use the humidity sensor to measure these
[08:26.040 --> 08:34.560]  and they use it in a static shield. So what's the next data look like? This is
[08:34.560 --> 08:41.960]  differences in the static shields. This is the RM Yong shield, which is a very
[08:41.960 --> 08:48.200]  widely used shield on weather stations. That had the greatest temperature
[08:48.200 --> 08:53.760]  increases in our tests, greater increases compared to the Metzbeck
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.800]  shields. Metzbeck has two models. Here's the one shown in green. Here's the two
[09:00.160 --> 09:06.600]  shown in blue. That MK1 was slightly better, but still they didn't get down to
[09:06.600 --> 09:14.720]  zero until there was a reasonable breeze blowing to cool it off. These three show
[09:14.720 --> 09:22.840]  the raw data all feeding into this summary. So shields vary a little bit, but
[09:22.840 --> 09:31.000]  even the best shields had errors in temperature. So what happens in the
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.880]  winter? Winter is a killer. There's snow on the ground, there's low angle light
[09:36.880 --> 09:42.680]  reflecting up on these shields so that radiation intensity is focused on the
[09:42.680 --> 09:49.000]  shield. They're not designed to block low angle radiation. Remember the shields have
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.840]  a design that looks like this. What happens when the sun comes in like that?
[09:54.840 --> 10:03.800]  It heats it up, gets right inside. Here's the data for no snow on the ground. This
[10:03.800 --> 10:10.400]  is over vegetative surface. Once the sun comes out the errors start to approach
[10:10.400 --> 10:17.080]  2 degrees C with no wind and they don't go to zero until we get a very stiff
[10:17.080 --> 10:23.920]  breeze blowing on these. So the errors are much worse over snow. Let's take a
[10:23.920 --> 10:29.840]  look now at the small differences between these three types of aspirated
[10:29.840 --> 10:41.760]  shields. These are the RM Young shield and the Apogee shield compared to the
[10:41.760 --> 10:49.360]  Met One shield. In our tests the Met One shield is slightly cooler so we use that as
[10:49.360 --> 10:56.480]  the reference here. There is no official reference for this. At zero things heat
[10:56.480 --> 11:03.080]  up as the radiation gets bigger. So here's temperature errors in the summer
[11:03.080 --> 11:14.680]  and they're less than 0.05 degrees C. The Apogee shield was slightly better than the RM
[11:14.680 --> 11:21.680]  Young shield for accuracy in these tests. But now look at the winter. Much worse.
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.680]  Remember the static shields were more than 1 degree C above air temperature.
[11:28.080 --> 11:34.400]  Now we've reduced that error to less than 0.1 degrees C even in the winter with the
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.880]  reflected light. And of course when it's dark there's no error at all.
[11:40.880 --> 11:48.400]  So these are all close. The Apogee shield in these tests outperformed the RM Young
[11:48.400 --> 11:55.480]  shield and was very close to the Met One shield. So how does this Apogee shield
[11:55.480 --> 12:02.800]  work? One of the design goals of this was to dramatically reduce the power to the
[12:02.800 --> 12:09.400]  shield. And let's take a side view look at this thing. Because if you're going to run
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.480]  these from a solar-powered system you either need an enormous solar panel or a
[12:14.480 --> 12:20.840]  more efficient design. This is the Apogee design right here in side view filled
[12:20.960 --> 12:27.640]  with foam, sensor port adapter right here going to the sensor. Now this is what's
[12:27.640 --> 12:36.240]  called a Coanda inlet. And it looks like a jet engine inlet so that when the wind
[12:36.240 --> 12:41.560]  is blowing sideways it can more easily change direction and go up here in the
[12:41.560 --> 12:49.600]  fan and blow out the top of the shield. If this was a square edge like it was in
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.040]  all of our early tests, anytime there was a crosswind we had problems. So we had to
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.980]  go to this specialized Coanda inlet coupled with a small sensor in just the
[12:58.980 --> 13:04.320]  right place. Notice the taper here. That's a rocket nozzle contour to get the wind
[13:04.320 --> 13:10.240]  going faster and faster over this shield right here. These are all critical to the
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.520]  design and critical to the use of a small fan. Here's the whole thing sealed
[13:15.520 --> 13:23.320]  up. It's G-Loy plastic, Venturi contour inlet. Now that we're here let me show you some of the
[13:23.320 --> 13:33.160]  component parts. Here's the fan. This is an IP55 rated fan that's custom-built for Apogee.
[13:33.160 --> 13:39.560]  IP55 is a measure of the resistance to water and dust. You can spray this fan
[13:39.560 --> 13:44.120]  with water and it doesn't hurt it. We have yet to have, in spite of now having
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.960]  several hundred of these in the field in very rugged environments, we have yet to
[13:48.960 --> 13:55.120]  ever have a fan fail. Some of them have been out for four years. It's rated for at
[13:55.120 --> 14:01.600]  least 50,000 hours. So this is an exceptionally rugged small low-power
[14:01.600 --> 14:11.280]  fan. This Coanda radius, we got it right here. Here it is. There's the Coanda radius so the air can
[14:11.480 --> 14:17.800]  come right up in here and the fan sits right in here and blow out. Now this whole thing is
[14:17.800 --> 14:27.880]  covered by a hat so that we can shield it from the sun and water. It's a
[14:27.880 --> 14:38.240]  simple yet elegant design. Let's take a look at some performance data. Here's the
[14:38.240 --> 14:50.520]  Coanda. You can see the difference in fan size. R.M. Young 400mA, Apogee 80mA. This is a
[14:50.520 --> 14:57.640]  five-fold reduction in power for the fan. So much smaller battery, much smaller
[14:57.640 --> 15:05.200]  solar panel. It gets better. At night you don't need to run the fan full blast. So
[15:05.320 --> 15:10.880]  Apogee has put in a variable speed fan, which I'm going to talk about in the next
[15:10.880 --> 15:18.400]  slide. But this is the difference in the Coanda radius. When the wind is blowing
[15:18.400 --> 15:24.560]  sideways, the R.M. Young got worse and because of that radius, the Apogee gets
[15:24.560 --> 15:31.440]  better, slightly better with high wind in spite of a five-fold reduction in speed.
[15:31.440 --> 15:40.480]  Now let's look at the variable speed fan. Here it is running full blast, 80mA
[15:40.480 --> 15:48.160]  with the ratio of one. At night or on cloudy days with a PWM component, we can slow
[15:48.160 --> 15:55.320]  the fan down all the way to 25mA and now the wind speed is less but
[15:55.320 --> 16:00.160]  the power consumption is much less. So it's already a small fan and we can
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.480]  further optimize it by slowing it down at night and on cloudy days or on days
[16:05.480 --> 16:11.000]  when the wind is already high. Don't need a fan. Here's the IP55 rating,
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.680]  tachometer output. So this is a separate wire to the data logger telling the
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.760]  RPMs of this fan. If anything gets in there and the fan is not working right,
[16:22.760 --> 16:29.240]  we'll slow it. It will show up and raise a red flag. This is how we save
[16:29.240 --> 16:35.520]  power, pulse width modulation from the data acquisition system. So there's a top
[16:35.520 --> 16:43.080]  view of the fan right there. How do you get the sensors in this? Other shields,
[16:43.080 --> 16:48.160]  they're big, you put them in from the top, you clamp them in. After lots of testing, we
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.400]  found the best way is put them in the side. Here's the picture, here's the
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.360]  shield, the sensors go right in the side like this. It's simple, it's elegant, you
[16:58.480 --> 17:04.880]  can take out sensors and change them, you can put in multiple sensors. Here's a
[17:04.880 --> 17:10.520]  bunch of pictures of what we call sensor port adapters. So if you need one
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.840]  thermistor, this is the sensor of choice. If you want to have replicates, there's
[17:15.840 --> 17:21.280]  two replicates, three replicates, four replicate thermistors for super
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.520]  precision work. It's easy to do, these are cheap and easy to make. Now if you want a
[17:26.520 --> 17:30.760]  humidity probe with it like everybody does, here we go. You buy the model with
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.760]  the humidity probe adapter and that looks like this. Here's a picture of that
[17:35.760 --> 17:42.320]  adapter, clips right in here, quarter turn, snaps into place, O-rings to hold the
[17:42.320 --> 17:48.160]  humidity probe in place. So these come in all shapes and sizes to hold a wide range
[17:48.160 --> 17:54.560]  of sensors. Here is a picture of one in action. It would sit like this in the
[17:54.560 --> 17:59.400]  shield. The air is coming up like this, we accurately measure the temperature
[17:59.400 --> 18:06.640]  there and then the humidity here. This is a HMP 110 shown as how this would go
[18:06.640 --> 18:13.800]  right into the adapter. So this is easy to do for a wide range of sensors and
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.400]  they're easy to take out and clean. That's another thing, these eventually get dirty
[18:18.400 --> 18:22.240]  and other shields take the whole shield apart. Here you just pop the sensors out,
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.120]  wipe them clean, put them right back in. That was another design feature that we
[18:26.120 --> 18:35.920]  put into this. There's a picture of that in the field. So these are the air
[18:35.920 --> 18:43.200]  temperature options for this. The Apogee ST-110 is that yellow bead thermistor. Now
[18:43.200 --> 18:49.760]  many places call for more precise data with the platinum resistance thermometer
[18:50.480 --> 18:57.440]  and here is an example of that with a four wire PRT in that sensor port
[18:57.440 --> 19:04.600]  adapter for places that require PRT accuracy measurements. This is another
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.480]  probe that works fine with it, the Campbell Scientific 109. A wide range of
[19:10.480 --> 19:12.600]  temperature sensors work fine.
[19:12.600 --> 19:19.680]  Visela, Campbell Scientific, Rotronics, EE Electronics, it works fine with a
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.640]  wide range of sensors just with the right sensor port adapter. Of course many
[19:23.640 --> 19:30.000]  people buy more than one sensor port adapter for future expansion. Here's a
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.760]  couple case studies in the field where this has been used. This is what's
[19:35.760 --> 19:46.040]  called the I Utah project and they use a lowercase i to be high-tech. There's
[19:46.120 --> 19:53.320]  many of these stations in the mountains of Utah monitoring snow melt where
[19:53.320 --> 19:57.720]  accuracy of air temperature is everything. How fast is the snow melt in
[19:57.720 --> 20:01.920]  the spring? How fast is the water run down in the valley? If we're off a tenth
[20:01.920 --> 20:07.480]  of a degree C, the models are wrong. We have to have accuracy. There's the Apogee
[20:07.480 --> 20:12.880]  shield. This by the way is Apogee heated pyranometer which they've selected for
[20:12.880 --> 20:18.560]  use on this for extreme winter conditions. This is just an example. Up in the
[20:18.560 --> 20:24.600]  mountains the snow gets deep so this stuff has to be high up. One more example
[20:24.600 --> 20:30.240]  is a greenhouse environment. This one happens to be Roberto Lopez's greenhouse
[20:30.240 --> 20:35.480]  at Purdue University. He ordered multiple Apogee sensors for precision air
[20:35.480 --> 20:39.640]  temperature measurement over his experimental plots. So here they are with
[20:39.720 --> 20:44.760]  the precision thermistor coming out and the shields, multiple replicate shields
[20:44.760 --> 20:52.440]  hanging in a greenhouse. So in summary the Apogee shield has been optimized for
[20:52.440 --> 20:59.160]  accuracy and low power and low cost. Those three things we think make it a
[20:59.160 --> 21:06.160]  very favorable choice for weather stations. When precision air temperature
[21:06.160 --> 21:12.920]  measurements are important, this can replace the old static shields for
[21:12.920 --> 21:18.920]  precision air temperature measurement. I'll stop there. That's the final slide
[21:18.920 --> 21:24.880]  in the shield measurement series. We hope to see you again in another measurement
[21:24.880 --> 21:26.360]  seminar. Thank you.
