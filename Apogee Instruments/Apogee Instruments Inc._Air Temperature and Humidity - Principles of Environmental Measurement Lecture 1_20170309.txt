[00:01.660 --> 00:27.150]  I'm Bruce Bugbee. We are here because I
[00:27.150 --> 00:28.890]  got asked to give a talk at a conference
[00:28.890 --> 00:31.690]  next week in Canberra. It's a controlled
[00:31.690 --> 00:35.730]  environments conference and that brought
[00:35.730 --> 00:38.770]  us over here and Apogee along with
[00:38.770 --> 00:41.930]  Peter has got a booth there, but we took
[00:41.930 --> 00:44.370]  the opportunity to come early to talk
[00:44.370 --> 00:47.890]  about environmental instrumentation. What
[00:47.890 --> 00:49.650]  we're going to talk about is really some
[00:49.650 --> 00:52.130]  basic stuff and I can see lots of you
[00:52.130 --> 00:53.970]  are interested in remote sensing and
[00:53.970 --> 00:57.170]  that's on the list toward the end, the
[00:57.170 --> 00:59.810]  hyperspectral imaging, those techniques.
[00:59.810 --> 01:02.330]  But of course as you all know that stuff
[01:02.330 --> 01:05.290]  has to be ground truth and how well do
[01:05.290 --> 01:06.850]  we make the measurements on the ground
[01:06.850 --> 01:09.050]  to do that. Now some of you do modeling
[01:09.050 --> 01:12.490]  and models need good data and boy it's
[01:12.490 --> 01:15.010]  no surprise to know that a lot of the
[01:15.010 --> 01:16.930]  data we put in models is not the highest
[01:17.010 --> 01:20.090]  quality data, so it leads to some
[01:20.090 --> 01:23.890]  problems. Mark and I have worked
[01:23.890 --> 01:30.010]  together for a long time on making better
[01:30.010 --> 01:33.250]  environmental measurements and along the
[01:33.250 --> 01:36.770]  way we develop better instruments.
[01:36.770 --> 01:39.690]  I teach a class in environmental
[01:39.690 --> 01:42.570]  instrumentation at the University, Utah
[01:42.570 --> 01:45.530]  State University, and we've done other
[01:45.570 --> 01:49.410]  workshops on this, on these instruments
[01:49.410 --> 01:50.930]  and that's what we're going to try and
[01:50.930 --> 01:52.930]  get through today. We're going to
[01:52.930 --> 01:54.570]  make it up a little as we go because of
[01:54.570 --> 01:58.330]  the timing of trying to get through as
[01:58.330 --> 02:01.570]  much as we can and leave you with the
[02:01.570 --> 02:03.850]  resources to pursue everything in more
[02:03.850 --> 02:07.170]  detail at the end of this. I want to
[02:07.170 --> 02:10.730]  set some of the stage.
[02:10.730 --> 02:13.530]  We're going to treat
[02:13.530 --> 02:16.930]  this a little like a class and we have
[02:16.930 --> 02:19.250]  plenty of these. We got our first
[02:19.250 --> 02:22.370]  handout and this is just a
[02:22.370 --> 02:25.050]  what you see on the
[02:25.050 --> 02:31.850]  screen. We'll do our best to get to
[02:31.850 --> 02:34.530]  everything in here. I really appreciate
[02:34.530 --> 02:37.090]  Marcus and the University. This is a
[02:37.090 --> 02:41.890]  great classroom. All the high-tech
[02:41.930 --> 02:47.010]  imaging stuff to present for you.
[02:47.010 --> 02:48.890]  Some of you may have seen this quote before,
[02:48.890 --> 02:52.610]  but it's meant as a joke, but
[02:52.610 --> 02:54.650]  boy there's a lot of truth in this
[02:54.650 --> 02:57.610]  statement. Everybody believes a
[02:57.610 --> 02:59.290]  measurement except the guy who made it
[02:59.290 --> 03:01.690]  and nobody believes a model except the
[03:01.690 --> 03:04.130]  guy who came up with the model.
[03:04.130 --> 03:07.570]  The gist of this is we ought to be pretty
[03:07.570 --> 03:10.130]  skeptical of measurements. Some of these
[03:10.130 --> 03:11.530]  measurements we're talking about are
[03:11.690 --> 03:14.170]  hard to make and when you're the guy
[03:14.170 --> 03:15.930]  making them you realize how hard they
[03:15.930 --> 03:17.650]  are to make and then a modeler grabs the
[03:17.650 --> 03:19.450]  numbers and well it's been shown that
[03:19.450 --> 03:23.370]  this and this. This is a great
[03:23.370 --> 03:25.570]  quote to keep coming back to as a
[03:25.570 --> 03:30.570]  reference point. Then this quote,
[03:30.570 --> 03:36.050]  let me put these halfway
[03:36.050 --> 03:39.570]  down so that we can see the screen just
[03:39.610 --> 03:42.650]  a bit better. Let me couple this quote
[03:42.650 --> 03:49.960]  with a parallel quote. Never believe an
[03:49.960 --> 03:52.360]  observation unless it can be
[03:52.360 --> 04:01.440]  substantiated with theory.
[04:01.440 --> 04:03.360]  You can see that fine
[04:03.360 --> 04:07.600]  dark wise. Really our
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.680]  measurements alone aren't going to
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.320]  get us where we need to be and models
[04:12.320 --> 04:14.000]  alone aren't going to get us to where we
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.520]  need to be. We're going back and forth
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.720]  constantly and people making measurements
[04:19.720 --> 04:21.840]  need to be aware of the theory behind
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.000]  the measurements so you can tell when
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.520]  you're collecting bad data. People making
[04:27.520 --> 04:30.040]  models need to work closely with people
[04:30.040 --> 04:32.240]  making measurements so they can assess
[04:32.240 --> 04:35.520]  the quality of the data. Model
[04:35.520 --> 04:37.680]  skills and measurement skills for
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.240]  starters have been largely neglected.
[04:41.240 --> 04:43.560]  We talk about the Internet of
[04:43.560 --> 04:45.240]  things, we just throw thousands of
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.240]  low-cost sensors out there and oh great
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.920]  what a recipe for disaster to collect a
[04:49.920 --> 04:52.720]  lot of bad data fast. If you
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.720]  understand the principles which we hope
[04:54.720 --> 04:57.320]  to review, you can tell when the
[04:57.320 --> 05:00.080]  measurements aren't of the highest
[05:00.080 --> 05:02.640]  quality and when you should be skeptical
[05:02.640 --> 05:05.640]  and hopefully prevent proliferation of
[05:05.640 --> 05:08.800]  bad stuff. These are two general
[05:08.800 --> 05:13.440]  principles leading to this. We're
[05:13.440 --> 05:15.200]  starting with measurement of air
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.440]  temperature, just the most fundamental
[05:17.440 --> 05:20.400]  thing. Everybody puts air
[05:20.400 --> 05:22.080]  temperature in the models, it's a basis
[05:22.080 --> 05:26.360]  for all kinds of things. As you'll
[05:26.360 --> 05:28.840]  see one of the key measurements that's
[05:28.840 --> 05:31.880]  very powerful is surface to air
[05:31.880 --> 05:35.400]  temperature difference and leaf to air
[05:35.440 --> 05:37.480]  temperature difference. That's a
[05:37.480 --> 05:39.200]  powerful measurement because we can tell
[05:39.200 --> 05:41.160]  how fast the plants are transpiring
[05:41.160 --> 05:43.560]  water. Mark is going to talk about
[05:43.560 --> 05:45.920]  infrared measurements of surface in just
[05:45.920 --> 05:49.520]  a few minutes. What we found as we
[05:49.520 --> 05:52.520]  pursued this more and more for irrigation
[05:52.520 --> 05:55.640]  scheduling and for hydration of plants
[05:55.640 --> 05:58.280]  is our measurements of the surface
[05:58.280 --> 06:00.680]  temperature were often better than
[06:00.680 --> 06:02.440]  our measurements of the air temperature.
[06:02.440 --> 06:05.440]  As a company that led us to come
[06:05.440 --> 06:07.480]  back to air temperature measurements
[06:07.480 --> 06:10.040]  and look at challenges with doing that.
[06:10.040 --> 06:13.040]  This is many years. I'm going to start
[06:13.040 --> 06:16.280]  with air temperature measurement and
[06:16.280 --> 06:23.920]  with luck, single screen, external video.
[06:23.920 --> 06:35.070]  If we can pull this up,
[06:39.350 --> 06:43.830]  it should be external video.
[06:43.830 --> 06:46.390]  I may have to push the HDMI
[06:46.390 --> 06:51.710]  again. There it is. This is the first
[06:51.710 --> 06:53.830]  slide from a talk of this, just
[06:53.830 --> 06:57.150]  principles of measuring air temperature.
[06:57.270 --> 07:00.310]  We're going to talk about two things.
[07:00.310 --> 07:02.870]  The type of sensor that we do use to
[07:02.870 --> 07:05.430]  measure air temperature and then how we
[07:05.430 --> 07:09.510]  shield that sensor from radiation. You
[07:09.510 --> 07:11.510]  think how hard can it be to measure air
[07:11.510 --> 07:13.390]  temperature, but if you put a thermometer
[07:13.390 --> 07:17.790]  out and they almost always read high. If
[07:17.790 --> 07:20.350]  there's any radiation coming into that
[07:20.350 --> 07:22.870]  sensor it goes high. It's not the correct
[07:22.990 --> 07:27.590]  air temperature. Now we're talking
[07:27.590 --> 07:29.510]  about automated measurements. Everything
[07:29.510 --> 07:31.470]  we talk about is automated, hooked up to
[07:31.470 --> 07:33.550]  a data acquisition system. Now we got
[07:33.550 --> 07:38.070]  electronic temperature sensors. In
[07:38.070 --> 07:40.310]  the history of weather measurement we
[07:40.310 --> 07:42.150]  have collected a lot of bad data with
[07:42.150 --> 07:45.030]  higher air temperatures than really
[07:45.030 --> 07:47.830]  exist because of radiation hitting the
[07:47.830 --> 07:51.270]  sensor and going above air temperature.
[07:51.390 --> 07:55.870]  Let's take a look at some radiation
[07:55.870 --> 07:59.910]  shields. This is very basic stuff. You
[07:59.910 --> 08:01.510]  look at all the weather stations out
[08:01.510 --> 08:03.710]  there collecting data and the vast
[08:03.710 --> 08:06.150]  majority have one of these multi-plate
[08:06.150 --> 08:09.510]  shields on them. We all pat ourselves
[08:09.510 --> 08:11.950]  in the back and say yes that's shielded.
[08:11.950 --> 08:14.910]  The sensors up inside this and the sun
[08:14.910 --> 08:18.030]  can't hit it and the wind blows and
[08:18.030 --> 08:20.310]  cools it off and we've got a great
[08:20.350 --> 08:23.270]  measurement of air temperature. That's
[08:23.270 --> 08:26.510]  true if the wind is blowing and the sun
[08:26.510 --> 08:29.070]  is not shining too brightly, but what
[08:29.070 --> 08:31.790]  happens if the wind is not blowing fast
[08:31.790 --> 08:34.910]  and the sun is shining right on it or if
[08:34.910 --> 08:37.170]  the sun is coming at somewhat of a low
[08:37.170 --> 08:39.590]  angle and it comes right into this thing.
[08:39.590 --> 08:44.870]  These we have shown in publications can
[08:44.870 --> 08:49.110]  have errors of 3 degrees C for air
[08:49.110 --> 08:51.470]  temperature. This is not a trivial error.
[08:51.470 --> 08:52.990]  It doesn't happen all the time, but they
[08:52.990 --> 08:57.070]  can have errors this big. A record was a
[08:57.070 --> 08:59.950]  place over snow in the mountains of Utah
[08:59.950 --> 09:02.190]  in the winter where the sun reflected
[09:02.190 --> 09:04.590]  off the snow and hit these things. We
[09:04.590 --> 09:07.390]  measured a 13 degree C temperature
[09:07.390 --> 09:12.110]  error with a static shield like this.
[09:12.110 --> 09:14.390]  Now we're people working on models of
[09:14.390 --> 09:17.030]  snow melt. If they use that data
[09:17.030 --> 09:19.390]  their models are way off. There are huge
[09:19.390 --> 09:22.470]  errors with this. What's the solution?
[09:22.470 --> 09:24.790]  Well manufacturers of static shields
[09:24.790 --> 09:27.510]  work on different plate configurations
[09:27.510 --> 09:29.990]  and different designs, but they still
[09:29.990 --> 09:33.150]  have problems when the wind isn't
[09:33.150 --> 09:36.350]  blowing. Wind blowing means three
[09:36.350 --> 09:41.030]  meters a second is enough to minimize
[09:41.030 --> 09:43.510]  the errors, but that's a reasonable
[09:43.510 --> 09:45.790]  breeze. What about all the data collect
[09:45.830 --> 09:48.710]  when the wind isn't blowing? The next
[09:48.710 --> 09:52.270]  level up from this is to go with one of
[09:52.270 --> 09:55.230]  these kinds of sensors, shields rather,
[09:55.230 --> 09:58.070]  which has a fan in it. It's an
[09:58.070 --> 10:01.950]  aspirated shield and now the wind is
[10:01.950 --> 10:04.750]  blowing all the time. The sensors inside
[10:04.750 --> 10:07.710]  and protected, those are far more
[10:07.710 --> 10:11.150]  accurate. They greatly minimize these
[10:11.150 --> 10:14.150]  errors. Now we're talking errors of a few
[10:14.190 --> 10:16.470]  tenths of a degree C instead of whole
[10:16.470 --> 10:21.670]  degree C. Why don't we just all
[10:21.670 --> 10:24.190]  switch to these if they're
[10:24.190 --> 10:27.270]  demonstrably more accurate. The problem
[10:27.270 --> 10:30.910]  is they're expensive and they require
[10:30.910 --> 10:34.070]  power. If you're at a remote station
[10:34.070 --> 10:37.830]  with solar power, some of these shields
[10:37.830 --> 10:42.670]  take somewhere between 250 to 400
[10:42.710 --> 10:44.750]  milliamps and you start to do the
[10:44.750 --> 10:47.550]  calculations, you need a really big panel
[10:47.550 --> 10:50.150]  and a really big battery to run those or
[10:50.150 --> 10:54.710]  you need AC power. We don't have AC
[10:54.710 --> 10:57.950]  power so this was the state several
[10:57.950 --> 11:00.670]  years ago and we said we got to have
[11:00.670 --> 11:02.150]  better measurements of air temperature.
[11:02.150 --> 11:04.710]  We started a research project to
[11:04.710 --> 11:07.390]  design a better shield and that resulted
[11:07.390 --> 11:10.150]  in this shield here which has a
[11:10.190 --> 11:13.990]  Qanda radius inlet and we were able to
[11:13.990 --> 11:17.670]  get a shield that takes 30 to 80
[11:17.670 --> 11:20.950]  milliamps of power. It's got a
[11:20.950 --> 11:23.830]  variable speed fan that can slow down.
[11:23.830 --> 11:25.750]  If you don't need the high-speed fan you
[11:25.750 --> 11:29.270]  can slow it down. The sun isn't shining,
[11:29.270 --> 11:30.630]  you don't have to have the fan on so
[11:30.630 --> 11:34.870]  high. We made this aspirated shield
[11:34.870 --> 11:37.110]  with much lower power and it can be now
[11:37.110 --> 11:42.270]  used on solar-powered stations.
[11:42.270 --> 11:46.270]  The cost is less, considerably less than
[11:46.270 --> 11:51.870]  these. That's the shield story. Anytime
[11:51.870 --> 11:53.910]  you look at temperature data depending
[11:53.910 --> 11:56.630]  on what you're doing, we ought to be
[11:56.630 --> 11:59.710]  skeptical about the wind speed at the
[11:59.710 --> 12:01.710]  site. If it's a site with high wind
[12:01.710 --> 12:04.510]  speeds we're probably fine with the
[12:04.510 --> 12:07.110]  static shields, but if it's a site that
[12:07.110 --> 12:09.830]  doesn't always have high wind speeds be
[12:09.830 --> 12:15.350]  careful of the temperature data.
[12:15.350 --> 12:20.510]  We can have greater confidence in temperature data taken at night time than in day time.
[12:20.510 --> 12:23.310]  Absolutely, good point. At night time
[12:23.310 --> 12:26.230]  there's no radiation coming in and that
[12:26.230 --> 12:31.270]  data should be accurate. We're interested in minimum temperature.
[12:31.270 --> 12:34.950]  Yes, and it's even better if there's
[12:34.950 --> 12:37.190]  some breeze at night, but the problem is
[12:37.190 --> 12:41.630]  greatly diminished at night. In fact
[12:41.630 --> 12:43.750]  that's somehow when we're doing rigorous
[12:43.750 --> 12:45.830]  tests at these we check to see that
[12:45.830 --> 12:48.430]  everything lines up at night and that's
[12:48.430 --> 12:50.830]  our reference. Now we wait for the
[12:50.830 --> 12:54.430]  next day with the sun.
[12:54.430 --> 12:57.350]  Minimum temperatures, which almost
[12:57.350 --> 12:59.670]  always occur at night, are much more
[12:59.670 --> 13:01.830]  accurate than maximum. Think of how many
[13:01.830 --> 13:03.630]  models we have that are min-max
[13:03.630 --> 13:06.270]  temperature from old data stations. The
[13:06.270 --> 13:09.150]  min's fine and the max is the daily max
[13:09.150 --> 13:11.510]  every day is one or two degrees too high.
[13:11.510 --> 13:16.030]  That's a big error and that's our data
[13:16.030 --> 13:17.750]  set that we're working with, historic
[13:17.750 --> 13:20.990]  data set, but now we know, yikes, some of
[13:20.990 --> 13:27.750]  our predictions are based on data that
[13:27.750 --> 13:30.430]  has trouble. A couple other slides of
[13:30.430 --> 13:33.310]  this, most widely measured variable.
[13:33.310 --> 13:36.950]  Lots of people are studying this problem.
[13:36.950 --> 13:40.990]  20 peer-reviewed papers in the last 14
[13:40.990 --> 13:42.230]  years, there's a bunch of them here,
[13:42.230 --> 13:45.270]  that's just example. We're going to make
[13:45.270 --> 13:47.710]  these slides available as PDFs so you
[13:47.710 --> 13:49.990]  can sit and study this stuff in great
[13:49.990 --> 13:54.750]  detail. This problem is not trivial
[13:54.750 --> 13:56.430]  as evidenced by the number of people
[13:56.550 --> 13:59.150]  studying it. Most of these are on shield
[13:59.150 --> 14:00.910]  designs and they're academic studies.
[14:00.910 --> 14:02.390]  They built a shield to tell you the
[14:02.390 --> 14:06.230]  errors of other stuff, but they're not
[14:06.230 --> 14:10.950]  designed to yield
[14:10.950 --> 14:14.150]  commercial solutions.
[14:14.150 --> 14:17.390]  Ross is it?
[14:17.390 --> 14:27.910]  Thank you for asking that. If we
[14:27.910 --> 14:31.110]  go back to those shields, as soon as you
[14:31.110 --> 14:35.230]  get, and now I'm not sure how well I can
[14:35.230 --> 14:37.390]  go back, but as soon as you get moisture
[14:37.390 --> 14:39.150]  on a static shield, which happens a lot
[14:39.150 --> 14:41.470]  if it's raining or misting or fogging or
[14:41.470 --> 14:44.790]  even at night condensation on the shield,
[14:44.790 --> 14:47.390]  now it reads too low because they've got
[14:47.390 --> 14:50.190]  evaporative cooling and it's below the
[14:50.190 --> 14:53.510]  true air temperature. That problem is
[14:53.510 --> 14:56.030]  also diminished by an aspirated shield
[14:56.030 --> 14:59.470]  which is drawing the air through it.
[14:59.470 --> 15:02.110]  We've seen that a lot when there's any
[15:02.110 --> 15:03.550]  kind of moisture on the shield you
[15:03.550 --> 15:08.070]  always get evaporative cooling.
[15:08.070 --> 15:09.910]  By the way, now that Peter's got my coffee, I
[15:09.910 --> 15:11.710]  got to tell you how fun it is to come to
[15:11.710 --> 15:13.510]  Australia and drink your coffee. It's
[15:13.550 --> 15:18.910]  terrific. I love good coffee and this
[15:18.910 --> 15:21.270]  morning at the hotel I'm complimenting
[15:21.270 --> 15:22.710]  them on the great coffee and they said
[15:22.710 --> 15:24.470]  yeah we visited the United States and
[15:24.470 --> 15:28.270]  your coffee is for shit, they said.
[15:28.270 --> 15:31.870]  It is. What a joy to come here and
[15:31.870 --> 15:36.190]  have a coffee. I did reverse order.
[15:36.190 --> 15:37.670]  There's shields, now we're going to talk a
[15:37.670 --> 15:41.550]  little bit about sensors. There's
[15:41.550 --> 15:44.310]  three kinds of sensors that people can
[15:44.310 --> 15:48.950]  put in shields and here they are.
[15:48.950 --> 15:52.270]  Thermocouples, time-honored thermocouples.
[15:52.270 --> 15:55.390]  They're cheap, you can run dozens of them,
[15:55.390 --> 15:59.190]  hook them up to a datalogger. Thermistors
[15:59.190 --> 16:04.350]  and platinum resistance thermometers or
[16:04.350 --> 16:07.230]  platinum resistance thermistors. These
[16:07.230 --> 16:09.070]  are the three categories that are
[16:09.270 --> 16:12.830]  fundamentally used. This is a thermistor
[16:12.830 --> 16:15.790]  that's super tiny. The first point
[16:15.790 --> 16:20.110]  here is small is always better with a
[16:20.110 --> 16:24.190]  temperature sensor because it stays in
[16:24.190 --> 16:26.230]  better equilibrium with the air
[16:26.230 --> 16:29.390]  temperature. All of these
[16:29.390 --> 16:31.670]  are pretty tiny sensors. This is only
[16:31.670 --> 16:33.870]  three millimeters. We have to put the old
[16:33.870 --> 16:36.030]  units for people in the United States on
[16:36.030 --> 16:40.030]  the screen. These are all pretty
[16:40.030 --> 16:43.470]  small sensors. Platinum resistance
[16:43.470 --> 16:45.790]  thermometers have long been
[16:45.790 --> 16:47.990]  thought to be the gold standard for
[16:47.990 --> 16:50.630]  temperature measurement. They're very
[16:50.630 --> 16:52.710]  small signal but they're rugged,
[16:52.710 --> 16:56.190]  they're stable, they're expensive, and
[16:56.190 --> 16:59.270]  they're slightly bigger. Now I want
[16:59.270 --> 17:01.790]  to show you the problems with platinum
[17:01.790 --> 17:05.430]  resistance thermometers. Thermistors,
[17:05.830 --> 17:10.110]  in our experience, are very underrated as
[17:10.110 --> 17:12.470]  a technology for measuring air
[17:12.470 --> 17:16.110]  temperature. They got a bad rap years ago
[17:16.110 --> 17:18.430]  because if moisture gets in a thermistor
[17:18.430 --> 17:21.310]  it can cause drift, but if you can
[17:21.310 --> 17:23.990]  prevent moisture from getting inside
[17:23.990 --> 17:28.110]  the sensor, not water but humidity, then
[17:28.110 --> 17:30.710]  thermistors are very very stable.
[17:30.710 --> 17:33.550]  This is an epoxy coated thermistor
[17:33.550 --> 17:37.670]  that we found to be very stable in very
[17:37.670 --> 17:40.670]  rugged environments and it's a much
[17:40.670 --> 17:45.910]  bigger signal. In our experience this is
[17:45.910 --> 17:49.390]  a sensor of choice compared to PRTs.
[17:49.390 --> 17:52.470]  Even if cost was no object it's a sensor
[17:52.470 --> 17:56.150]  of choice. Thermocouples are the least
[17:56.150 --> 17:58.110]  accurate of the three. They require
[17:58.110 --> 18:00.630]  reference temperatures and they're
[18:00.630 --> 18:02.430]  just the least accurate of the three
[18:02.430 --> 18:04.430]  although they're cheap you can
[18:04.430 --> 18:09.150]  make a lot of thermocouples.
[18:09.150 --> 18:11.790]  Small is better.
[18:11.790 --> 18:16.950]  PRTs are not all the same. People think
[18:16.950 --> 18:19.350]  oh I have a PRT, yeah well what kind of
[18:19.350 --> 18:22.270]  a PRT? You can study this a bit
[18:22.270 --> 18:25.270]  later. There's class C, B, A, 1 3rd, 1 10th,
[18:25.270 --> 18:28.430]  DIN, and here's the accuracy specs.
[18:28.430 --> 18:31.190]  Here's this yellow bead that we've
[18:31.190 --> 18:33.710]  really liked and we sell this with the
[18:33.710 --> 18:37.750]  shields. 0.1 degree C accuracy, these are
[18:37.750 --> 18:41.670]  the relative cost of these. Now we did it.
[18:41.670 --> 18:43.390]  I'm going to show you a tiny bit of data
[18:43.390 --> 18:46.750]  in which we compared these two sensors.
[18:46.750 --> 18:50.870]  A class A with an epoxy bead. You
[18:50.870 --> 18:53.110]  can see they have similar specifications.
[18:53.110 --> 18:56.230]  How did this come out? What we did was put
[18:56.230 --> 18:58.190]  them in an accelerated aging chamber
[18:58.190 --> 19:00.510]  where we cycle the temperature up and
[19:00.510 --> 19:03.030]  down, up and down, in high humidity to
[19:03.030 --> 19:05.350]  try and cause failures of the sensor.
[19:05.350 --> 19:07.390]  Accelerated aging is one of the
[19:07.390 --> 19:10.110]  tests that any good instrument company
[19:10.110 --> 19:12.190]  runs in all their sensors. We always try
[19:12.190 --> 19:13.710]  to build stuff and then we try to make
[19:13.710 --> 19:16.390]  it fail and we test it and test it until
[19:16.390 --> 19:20.070]  we see what its limits are. We do
[19:20.070 --> 19:23.990]  that. Here's the comparison 96 cycles
[19:23.990 --> 19:26.630]  minus 20 to plus 60. The water is
[19:26.630 --> 19:29.910]  condensing and freezing and bad. There's
[19:29.910 --> 19:32.830]  the data over the number of cycles. Take
[19:32.830 --> 19:34.750]  them out and check them. The red lines are
[19:34.750 --> 19:37.270]  the PRTs and the blue lines are the
[19:37.270 --> 19:39.590]  thermistors. If you look at this data
[19:39.590 --> 19:42.910]  you say well let's normalize it to zero
[19:42.910 --> 19:46.190]  on day one and those thermistors were
[19:46.190 --> 19:49.790]  more stable than the PRTs. It's an
[19:49.790 --> 19:52.150]  example of the kind of testing that we
[19:52.150 --> 19:55.790]  do on sensors and that's led us to use
[19:55.790 --> 19:58.030]  this specific thermistor for air
[19:58.070 --> 20:07.800]  temperature. This is the story of
[20:07.800 --> 20:11.640]  radiation sensors and there's lots of
[20:11.640 --> 20:14.160]  data and lots of tests and lots of sites.
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.760]  I think what I'd like to do next for a
[20:18.760 --> 20:22.760]  few minutes is talk about humidity.
[20:22.760 --> 20:24.160]  Along with temperature we're doing
[20:24.160 --> 20:25.960]  humidity and whether it's fire
[20:25.960 --> 20:31.240]  forecasting. We don't specifically
[20:31.240 --> 20:34.040]  sell a humidity probe but there's many
[20:34.040 --> 20:36.520]  available. They're getting better all the
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.560]  time. We've got our favorite sensors and
[20:39.560 --> 20:41.560]  we've done a lot of accelerated aging
[20:41.560 --> 20:45.200]  testing with humidity probes too. I'm not
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.400]  so much going to talk about choices
[20:47.400 --> 20:51.840]  among humidity sensors as I am with the
[20:51.840 --> 20:55.560]  principles of psychometrics, which means
[20:56.160 --> 21:00.280]  what's the difference between relative
[21:00.280 --> 21:03.800]  humidity and absolute humidity? Now I
[21:03.800 --> 21:07.680]  suspect many of you in here could write
[21:07.680 --> 21:10.760]  a really nice test question answer to
[21:10.760 --> 21:14.640]  that question, but absolute humidity is
[21:14.640 --> 21:19.680]  what drives pretty much all environmental
[21:19.680 --> 21:24.120]  responses. Stomatal responses and
[21:24.160 --> 21:26.520]  atmospheric humidity responses and yet
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.120]  what we measure is relative humidity.
[21:30.120 --> 21:32.840]  I'm going to take a minute to go through
[21:32.840 --> 21:39.880]  this and I've taught this several times
[21:39.880 --> 21:46.200]  and nowadays we're going to have, I got
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.760]  plenty of these, so in the end we'll
[21:48.760 --> 21:53.960]  stack them up at the end.
[21:53.960 --> 22:17.670]  Hopefully this will switch.
[22:17.670 --> 22:24.390]  This is the time-honored psychometric
[22:24.390 --> 22:28.990]  chart and what I find is modern students
[22:29.030 --> 22:30.950]  never seen this chart, they do these all
[22:30.950 --> 22:32.590]  the time, but they just type a number in
[22:32.590 --> 22:34.310]  a computer and it gives them an output
[22:34.310 --> 22:36.950]  and you ask them about the relationships
[22:36.950 --> 22:38.550]  and they just don't know. I don't know,
[22:38.550 --> 22:41.550]  the computer calculated it for me. I find
[22:41.550 --> 22:46.230]  that really dangerous. If you type
[22:46.230 --> 22:47.870]  psychometric chart on the internet you
[22:47.870 --> 22:50.670]  get thousands of images of this for
[22:50.670 --> 22:53.390]  different elevations. There's a chart for
[22:53.390 --> 22:55.230]  low temperature and high temperature.
[22:55.230 --> 22:59.110]  We're at 1500 meters in
[22:59.110 --> 23:02.870]  Logan, Utah. This is a 1500 meter
[23:02.870 --> 23:04.630]  chart which is the one I happen to have,
[23:04.630 --> 23:09.630]  but the one for sea level is very
[23:09.630 --> 23:12.390]  similar. The principles are identical and
[23:12.390 --> 23:14.990]  if you overlay them there's a
[23:14.990 --> 23:17.950]  small difference.
[23:17.950 --> 23:21.910]  We use this for an example. There are
[23:21.910 --> 23:28.270]  five cardinal humidity parameters and
[23:28.270 --> 23:30.870]  if you know any two of those you can
[23:30.870 --> 23:34.310]  calculate the other three. In a computer
[23:34.310 --> 23:36.110]  you can type them in, but what I want to show
[23:36.110 --> 23:38.830]  you is how to do that on a chart. This
[23:38.830 --> 23:43.470]  bottom axis right here, dry bulb, that's a
[23:43.470 --> 23:45.390]  manual thermometer. We don't do this
[23:45.390 --> 23:47.430]  anymore, we use electronic measurements
[23:47.430 --> 23:49.510]  but all the charts still say dry bulb
[23:49.510 --> 23:51.910]  and that just means air temperature
[23:51.910 --> 23:53.390]  with measured with something that's not
[23:53.390 --> 23:56.470]  wet. Air temperature is the bottom.
[23:56.470 --> 23:59.470]  The next thing before we had fancy
[23:59.470 --> 24:02.670]  electronic instruments, the second thing
[24:02.670 --> 24:05.990]  we measured was wet bulb. This is a
[24:05.990 --> 24:08.470]  sling psychrometer and if you're older
[24:08.470 --> 24:10.390]  you know these things and people
[24:10.390 --> 24:12.430]  like slide rules whip them out. You
[24:12.430 --> 24:14.110]  need to know the humidity and swing it.
[24:14.110 --> 24:18.030]  One of these gets wet and one's
[24:18.030 --> 24:19.590]  dry and you have to swing this pretty
[24:19.590 --> 24:21.470]  good for a couple minutes. What do you
[24:21.470 --> 24:27.440]  think the humidity is in here? Relative
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.680]  because this can't calculate absolute
[24:30.680 --> 24:33.880]  right? This is going to be a little
[24:33.880 --> 24:36.320]  tricky, but guess what this is an old
[24:36.320 --> 24:38.000]  one and it reads out in those ancient
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.680]  units called Fahrenheit. We're at
[24:42.680 --> 24:47.840]  64 Fahrenheit, this chart is in
[24:47.840 --> 24:50.760]  Celsius. We're going to convert. We're at
[24:50.760 --> 24:58.480]  75 so we're 24 Celsius in this room, 23
[24:58.480 --> 25:10.800]  Celsius and we are at 17 wet bulb 17.
[25:10.800 --> 25:12.720]  Let's calculate the humidity with this.
[25:12.720 --> 25:15.400]  By the way, see these are so slick, this is
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.560]  see how nonlinear this chart is. The old
[25:19.560 --> 25:21.320]  guys know how to use slide rules, that's
[25:21.320 --> 25:22.720]  you're getting really old if you still
[25:22.720 --> 25:25.200]  know that. This is an example of a slide
[25:25.200 --> 25:26.720]  rule because you put the wet and dry
[25:26.720 --> 25:28.200]  bulb in here and slide it and it will
[25:28.200 --> 25:30.800]  tell you the humidity. No batteries, no
[25:30.800 --> 25:32.800]  computer, I just love these old
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.200]  instruments. How do we find this
[25:36.200 --> 25:43.320]  on a chart? The wet bulb temperature is
[25:43.320 --> 25:46.880]  read up here on this line and what did
[25:46.880 --> 25:50.960]  we just say? Let's find it. 24, so right
[25:50.960 --> 25:58.040]  there is 24 and 17, here's 15, 16, here's
[25:58.040 --> 26:05.120]  17 wet bulb. From this line, I keep
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.760]  wanting to draw it on the board, we go up
[26:07.760 --> 26:13.360]  straight up from this here, we come in
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.520]  at a diagonal here.
[26:19.520 --> 26:34.800]  There's our point on the graph for what we just measure.
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.160]  We're getting 52% humidity.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.120]  If I would have swung this longer
[26:40.120 --> 26:41.640]  this probably would have come down and
[26:41.640 --> 26:44.680]  but you get the idea. It's the
[26:44.680 --> 26:47.400]  intersection of those two points for
[26:47.400 --> 26:50.080]  humidity. Now we've entered two things,
[26:50.080 --> 26:52.800]  wet bulb and dry bulb and we calculated
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.320]  a third thing that relative humidity is
[26:55.320 --> 26:56.680]  these curved lines. That's where I'm
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.760]  getting 52%. Now what else can we
[26:58.760 --> 27:02.920]  tell from this? Dew point temperature, the
[27:02.920 --> 27:05.720]  temperature at which water condenses on
[27:05.720 --> 27:08.960]  a surface on a leaf, anything. You pull a
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.200]  can of beer out of your fridge and put
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.360]  it in your room and water condenses on it
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.920]  because it's below the dew point. Dew
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.760]  point on this chart is red sideways
[27:20.760 --> 27:27.440]  going over here and it's the second
[27:27.440 --> 27:32.040]  scale or it's red this way.
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.520]  How did that happen? I put my hand on
[27:36.640 --> 27:56.260]  something. Dew points red
[27:56.260 --> 27:58.740]  sideways. Dew point right here, the dew
[27:58.740 --> 28:03.220]  point in this room 10, 11, 12, 13.5
[28:03.220 --> 28:05.380]  degrees. Any temperature below that
[28:05.380 --> 28:07.540]  water will change state and condense.
[28:07.540 --> 28:10.380]  Above it, it'll never happen and you can
[28:10.380 --> 28:13.860]  read it either direction. Now we have
[28:13.860 --> 28:17.900]  dry bulb, wet bulb, relative humidity,
[28:17.980 --> 28:26.220]  dew point temperature, and the final
[28:26.220 --> 28:30.980]  parameter that we want to know on this
[28:30.980 --> 28:36.500]  is the absolute humidity of the air and
[28:36.500 --> 28:40.180]  that's also read on this on this scale
[28:40.180 --> 28:42.940]  here. It says absolute humidity, this
[28:42.940 --> 28:46.060]  is in grams per kilogram and it's 12
[28:46.180 --> 28:49.380]  grams per little less than 12.
[28:49.380 --> 28:54.540]  I hit that again right there. I'm going to
[28:54.540 --> 28:56.580]  move this over and I won't hit it so
[28:56.580 --> 29:00.820]  much. There's an example of two inputs
[29:00.820 --> 29:02.500]  and you can tell how any two of these
[29:02.500 --> 29:04.740]  you always get a point and then you
[29:04.740 --> 29:06.280]  calculate the spread out you get the
[29:06.280 --> 29:09.940]  other three parameters from this. Here's
[29:09.940 --> 29:12.700]  the key thing. Now we just did absolute
[29:12.700 --> 29:16.660]  humidity, it's the mass or the moles of
[29:16.660 --> 29:19.900]  water vapor and air, the absolute density
[29:19.900 --> 29:22.980]  not the relative. Here's the key
[29:22.980 --> 29:26.140]  thing with this. If we're calculating
[29:26.140 --> 29:29.380]  rates of evaporation from a surface, what
[29:29.380 --> 29:34.180]  we want to know is the absolute humidity
[29:34.180 --> 29:38.260]  deficit or the vapor pressure deficit.
[29:38.260 --> 29:41.260]  We calculate that in computers and
[29:41.260 --> 29:43.420]  models all the time. We can get that
[29:43.420 --> 29:47.100]  from this chart. In this room at this
[29:47.100 --> 29:50.180]  temperature we keep going up here to
[29:50.180 --> 29:55.340]  this line. This is a hundred percent
[29:55.340 --> 30:00.660]  humidity in this room. This is the actual
[30:00.660 --> 30:03.820]  humidity. Now let's take that sideways to
[30:03.820 --> 30:10.800]  get the absolute humidity and it's a
[30:10.800 --> 30:12.920]  point right there and it looks like this
[30:12.960 --> 30:17.800]  is 23 and I'm going to round this off to
[30:17.800 --> 30:22.160]  12. The deficit in this room is 23
[30:22.160 --> 30:26.120]  minus 12 and it's this line right
[30:26.120 --> 30:31.880]  here. That's the absolute humidity
[30:31.880 --> 30:34.600]  deficit in this room or out wherever you
[30:34.600 --> 30:37.400]  measure this thing. This is what drives
[30:37.400 --> 30:40.920]  evaporation and transpiration. It is not
[30:40.920 --> 30:44.400]  relative humidity. You can ask the
[30:44.400 --> 30:47.320]  question if we had a wet dish rag here
[30:47.320 --> 30:50.520]  and we wanted to calculate how long it
[30:50.520 --> 30:53.480]  would take to dry. This is one of my
[30:53.480 --> 30:55.320]  favorite test questions because you can
[30:55.320 --> 30:58.200]  trip students up all the time. In one
[30:58.200 --> 31:01.120]  case we're going to put it at eighty
[31:01.120 --> 31:05.680]  percent humidity but 30 degrees C and
[31:05.680 --> 31:09.400]  the other case the other way around.
[31:09.400 --> 31:11.840]  You have the eighty percent humidity and 30
[31:11.840 --> 31:15.280]  degrees C or we're going to put it at
[31:15.280 --> 31:20.600]  sixty percent humidity and 15 degrees C.
[31:20.600 --> 31:23.480]  They said well it will dry faster in
[31:23.480 --> 31:26.680]  the lower humidity. No it won't. Sixty
[31:26.680 --> 31:29.120]  percent humidity down here is this
[31:29.120 --> 31:32.160]  big of a deficit and over here eighty
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.280]  percent humidity is a bigger deficit.
[31:35.280 --> 31:37.840]  Humidity interacts with temperature to
[31:37.880 --> 31:42.000]  create this vapor pressure deficit which
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.480]  you can see from this chart. You don't
[31:45.480 --> 31:47.680]  need the whole chart that's why this
[31:47.680 --> 31:50.680]  subset is in here. Here's the curve and
[31:50.680 --> 31:54.360]  the equation for a hundred percent and
[31:54.360 --> 31:56.440]  if you know relative humidity which is
[31:56.440 --> 31:59.120]  what we usually measure you can multiply
[31:59.120 --> 32:01.640]  the saturation by the relative humidity
[32:01.640 --> 32:04.600]  and then you can easily calculate this
[32:04.600 --> 32:06.240]  without the chart because you got you
[32:06.240 --> 32:10.000]  always got a point on this chart.
[32:10.000 --> 32:12.440]  Here's digital values for that line.
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.520]  That's psychometrics in 10 minutes or so
[32:16.520 --> 32:20.440]  and I find that useful to have a good
[32:20.440 --> 32:22.400]  understanding of that, intuitive
[32:22.400 --> 32:24.440]  understanding so you can get a sense of
[32:24.440 --> 32:27.080]  when people collect bad data and how to
[32:27.080 --> 32:30.000]  use humidity data to put it in
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  units that we want to understand.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.720]  I'll stop here except for one
[32:38.720 --> 32:44.400]  brief comment. We put wind on here in
[32:44.400 --> 32:47.280]  the first section and this is a separate
[32:47.280 --> 32:53.080]  category of measurements. We all measure
[32:53.080 --> 32:55.920]  wind with cup anemometers. That's so
[32:55.920 --> 32:59.920]  common but an emerging technology is
[32:59.920 --> 33:03.960]  sonic anemometers which I don't have
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.320]  a picture of them here, but they measure
[33:08.320 --> 33:10.680]  wind speed by the speed of sound and
[33:10.680 --> 33:13.720]  historically those have been about a
[33:13.720 --> 33:16.480]  thousand dollars for the instrument and
[33:16.480 --> 33:19.360]  the cup anemometers are 300 to 500 US
[33:19.360 --> 33:21.000]  dollars and that's about half the price
[33:21.000 --> 33:26.080]  relative. Sonic anemometers are getting
[33:26.080 --> 33:29.280]  cheaper and they're more accurate and
[33:29.280 --> 33:31.040]  they're particularly more accurate
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.280]  because at wind speeds below a half a
[33:33.400 --> 33:35.760]  meter per second the cup stop turning
[33:35.760 --> 33:39.400]  and that just reads a zero and it's
[33:39.400 --> 33:42.000]  never really zero. Sonic
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.760]  anemometers go all the way down to zero.
[33:44.760 --> 33:48.080]  This is another example of the march
[33:48.080 --> 33:50.480]  of technology making measurements more
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.200]  accurate and prices are coming down. I
[33:54.200 --> 33:56.760]  don't think we're going to see a switch
[33:56.760 --> 33:59.200]  overnight to sonic anemometers but in
[33:59.200 --> 34:02.000]  some locations with low wind speeds
[34:02.120 --> 34:05.040]  sonic anemometers are the instrument
[34:05.040 --> 34:07.320]  measurement of choice if you need to
[34:07.320 --> 34:09.440]  build models in places where there's
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.560]  not high winds. That's about all I
[34:12.560 --> 34:17.440]  want to say about wind speed. Any
[34:17.440 --> 34:19.360]  questions? Some of you have been asking
[34:19.360 --> 34:22.160]  questions. Yes? You mentioned the types of
[34:22.160 --> 34:26.760]  instruments that measure temperature
[34:26.760 --> 34:29.280]  with but how about humidity because
[34:29.600 --> 34:32.600]  some things are done, it's always related
[34:32.600 --> 34:37.120]  to the humidity measurement. It's
[34:37.120 --> 34:40.000]  related to the temperature. What is what
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.320]  exactly measures the humidity? What
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.320]  is the device or material? Good question.
[34:46.320 --> 34:48.960]  There's different ways to measure
[34:48.960 --> 34:51.160]  humidity but by far the most common one
[34:51.160 --> 34:53.120]  is what's called a capacitance probe.
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.840]  Looks like a like a fat sharpie.
[34:56.840 --> 35:00.840]  They're roughly this size. In the end of
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.200]  this is a chip that changes the
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.320]  capacitance based on the adsorption and
[35:09.320 --> 35:11.760]  desorption of water vapor molecules.
[35:11.760 --> 35:14.120]  That's the fundamental physics of how it
[35:14.120 --> 35:20.400]  measures humidity. It's
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.040]  been around for 20 years, 30 years and
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.320]  they've gotten better and better.
[35:27.320 --> 35:29.160]  Then alongside of that is a
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.520]  temperature sensor. Those two
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.120]  things, that's why I did psychometrics,
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.520]  temperature and humidity together give
[35:37.520 --> 35:40.200]  you the whole package for this deficit.
[35:40.200 --> 35:43.520]  Remember I said small is better? Look how
[35:43.520 --> 35:46.600]  big that is. These can have bigger errors
[35:46.600 --> 35:49.760]  in a static shield because there's not
[35:49.760 --> 35:52.640]  the wind cooling off the sensor. We
[35:52.720 --> 35:55.280]  like to have a separate temperature
[35:55.280 --> 35:57.800]  sensor and then calculate the humidity
[35:57.800 --> 36:06.440]  from this. This heats up because of
[36:06.440 --> 36:08.480]  the radiation hitting it even inside a
[36:08.480 --> 36:11.920]  shield. You would go man you know my
[36:11.920 --> 36:14.480]  humidity is not right because that the
[36:14.480 --> 36:16.360]  sensor is a little hotter than it should be.
[36:16.360 --> 36:18.680]  Here's something you can see from a
[36:18.680 --> 36:22.360]  psychometric chart. These errors of
[36:22.400 --> 36:25.000]  heating this tend to be self-correcting.
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.040]  Let's say the humidity is 52 and this
[36:30.040 --> 36:32.280]  the true humidity is 52 in this room and
[36:32.280 --> 36:33.720]  we're measuring this and the sun
[36:33.720 --> 36:36.960]  shining on it and it heats up. As it
[36:36.960 --> 36:40.000]  heats up it goes this way, but the
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.280]  humidity goes down, automatically goes
[36:42.280 --> 36:45.160]  down because it's heating up and
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.240]  the absolute humidity tends to
[36:48.240 --> 36:51.200]  be self-correcting. The humidity is wrong,
[36:51.240 --> 36:53.240]  the temperature is wrong, but they're
[36:53.240 --> 36:55.400]  wrong in the same direction and this
[36:55.400 --> 36:57.680]  data point moves horizontally on this
[36:57.680 --> 36:59.680]  graph somewhere over in here because
[36:59.680 --> 37:01.280]  most of the time what we want to know is
[37:01.280 --> 37:04.240]  that absolute humidity. Not sure if this
[37:04.240 --> 37:06.560]  is exactly your question.
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.640]  I have had this problem
[37:08.640 --> 37:11.240]  because the temperature is not calibrated
[37:11.240 --> 37:14.400]  well so the humidity is wrong.
[37:14.400 --> 37:16.320]  Then I wonder if there were different
[37:16.320 --> 37:17.880]  types in the same way there are
[37:17.920 --> 37:22.320]  different types of materials that you
[37:22.320 --> 37:24.000]  use for the temperature if there are
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.040]  different things. So I understand that
[37:26.040 --> 37:29.800]  most of the humidity sensors will use
[37:29.800 --> 37:37.400]  this chip? Yes. There is no other...
[37:37.400 --> 37:40.000]  No, there are other ways.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.240]  You can do absorption and some
[37:43.240 --> 37:45.440]  really expensive ways to do humidity.
[37:45.440 --> 37:47.280]  Something like average and commercial.
[37:47.280 --> 37:50.800]  This is by far the dominant way.
[37:50.800 --> 37:54.360]  We can talk later about differences
[37:54.360 --> 37:57.040]  among brands. The biggest thing we see is
[37:57.040 --> 37:59.880]  stability of these. You know you get
[37:59.880 --> 38:01.640]  them out of a box and all of them are
[38:01.640 --> 38:04.200]  good and now you check them again a year
[38:04.200 --> 38:07.040]  or two later for drift and that's
[38:07.040 --> 38:12.680]  where we see differences among types.
[38:12.680 --> 38:16.600]  It's a combination of this
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.320]  and this. It's another reason I like this
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.080]  chart because you can see what happens
[38:21.080 --> 38:22.280]  if you go this way.
[38:22.280 --> 38:24.640]  That's self-correcting error. John?
[38:24.640 --> 38:28.880]  You said there's what drives transpiration and evaporation
[38:28.880 --> 38:31.160]  is more absolute humidity. Yes.
[38:31.160 --> 38:35.160]  Peter would know this better than me, but I think in the Penman-Monteith equation
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.160]  they use relative humidity in that equation.
[38:39.160 --> 38:43.160]  Does that make any difference?
[38:43.720 --> 38:45.720]  Do you remember that Mark?
[38:45.720 --> 38:48.720]  Yeah, I can answer this question.
[38:48.720 --> 38:50.720]  What they're doing in Penman-Monteith is
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.720]  a routine application like in a data logger
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.120]  for example. I know Campbell
[38:58.120 --> 39:00.120]  Scientific data loggers really well so
[39:00.120 --> 39:02.880]  I'll use that as an example. You just go
[39:02.880 --> 39:04.920]  input the weather measurements that are
[39:04.920 --> 39:06.720]  necessary into an instruction that
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.400]  they've already pre-programmed into
[39:08.400 --> 39:11.120]  Campbell Scientific software and the
[39:11.120 --> 39:13.320]  input there is relative humidity and
[39:13.320 --> 39:16.080]  temperature. In actuality the
[39:16.080 --> 39:18.040]  pre-programmed instruction has some
[39:18.040 --> 39:20.880]  code running in the background that's
[39:20.880 --> 39:23.000]  calculating the absolute humidity just
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.800]  like Bruce explained. So the Penman-Monteith
[39:25.800 --> 39:28.560]  equation itself uses the vapor
[39:28.560 --> 39:31.120]  pressure deficit which is absolute
[39:31.120 --> 39:33.520]  humidity minus the actual humidity of the air.
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.280]  There's a difference here. But a lot of times when
[39:35.280 --> 39:37.960]  you see the equation in a data
[39:37.960 --> 39:40.880]  logger instruction or sometimes as it's
[39:40.880 --> 39:43.120]  explained maybe in a textbook they always
[39:43.120 --> 39:44.520]  talk about the measurement you're making
[39:44.520 --> 39:46.160]  is relative humidity and that's because
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.120]  the sensors that we have measure relative humidity.
[39:51.120 --> 39:53.440]  We don't have sensors to do absolute
[39:53.440 --> 39:56.080]  humidity. We always calculate it from
[39:56.080 --> 39:59.280]  the data and sometimes it just
[39:59.280 --> 40:02.520]  shows up on the screen. But the
[40:02.520 --> 40:05.080]  fundamental physics is the absolute
[40:05.080 --> 40:06.800]  humidity.
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.360]  Just a quick comment, less modern glasshouse
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.600]  climate control systems control the
[40:13.600 --> 40:14.960]  humidity deficit.
[40:14.960 --> 40:18.680]  Yeah, excellent. It's
[40:18.680 --> 40:20.360]  calculated in the background by the
[40:20.360 --> 40:22.200]  microprocessors in the
[40:22.200 --> 40:23.920]  greenhouse. That's one of the
[40:23.920 --> 40:25.920]  wonderful advances of the march of
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.960]  technology to do that.
