[00:01.020 --> 00:08.840]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, professor of crop physiology at Utah State University, and we have been
[00:08.840 --> 00:17.060]  asked so often by home growers, what are the optimal conditions to grow cannabis at home?
[00:17.060 --> 00:23.800]  So in this video, I'm going to go through all of the environmental, all of the key environmental
[00:23.800 --> 00:30.460]  parameters and the ways that we measure them here in a research laboratory and ways that
[00:30.460 --> 00:38.380]  you can measure them at home to get optimal conditions for cannabis.
[00:38.380 --> 00:44.580]  We have a license to study medical hemp here at Utah State University, so we're going to
[00:44.580 --> 00:50.060]  take those principles and now scale them down for home use.
[00:50.060 --> 00:58.420]  So one of the things that we often talk about are the nine cardinal parameters for plant
[00:58.420 --> 00:59.960]  growth.
[00:59.960 --> 01:05.300]  And I drew a little plant here to give you a sense of this.
[01:05.300 --> 01:10.980]  Let me put the parameters on here and then we'll talk about each of them in turn.
[01:10.980 --> 01:12.820]  Let's start with temperature.
[01:12.820 --> 01:16.640]  I'm going to just put temp over here.
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.780]  Then we'll put humidity.
[01:21.780 --> 01:28.220]  Then we'll put wind and inside we usually call that air velocity.
[01:28.220 --> 01:34.500]  CO2, and we put brackets around that to show CO2 concentration.
[01:34.500 --> 01:35.600]  How do we measure it?
[01:35.600 --> 01:36.980]  What are optimum levels?
[01:36.980 --> 01:42.120]  And now we go underground and to get this just right, we go to ground.
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.740]  So we have temperature down here in the root zone.
[01:46.740 --> 01:51.060]  We certainly have water in the root zone.
[01:51.060 --> 02:03.210]  Wind and then finally oxygen.
[02:03.210 --> 02:06.750]  So here's our parameters.
[02:06.750 --> 02:10.050]  You can pretty quickly see that's only eight parameters.
[02:10.050 --> 02:12.370]  I want to start with light.
[02:12.370 --> 02:16.810]  Light we put up here, L-I-G-H-T.
[02:16.810 --> 02:17.810]  It's enormous.
[02:17.810 --> 02:19.890]  It's coming from all directions.
[02:19.890 --> 02:22.530]  It affects everything in here.
[02:22.530 --> 02:27.250]  When we turn up the light, the water flux through the plant goes up.
[02:27.250 --> 02:30.410]  The optimum levels of other things change.
[02:30.410 --> 02:37.290]  So to optimize growth, we have to start by optimizing light.
[02:37.290 --> 02:42.010]  Now this same diagram is over here.
[02:42.010 --> 02:45.490]  I've shown this many times in talks.
[02:45.650 --> 02:56.330]  What I want to show you is a little bit of data from our laboratory on a couple of cultivars.
[02:56.330 --> 02:58.450]  Here we can zoom in on this baby.
[02:58.450 --> 03:02.010]  Get it big.
[03:02.010 --> 03:04.810]  A couple of cultivars.
[03:04.810 --> 03:13.930]  This is yield and this is an input parameter called DLI, daily light integral.
[03:14.050 --> 03:20.930]  What I'm going to show you right now is how to measure this because the higher the number,
[03:20.930 --> 03:22.370]  the higher the yield.
[03:22.370 --> 03:30.290]  This is a curved line, but look at these numbers are still going up as we approach 60.
[03:30.290 --> 03:39.170]  Now 60 is a sunny summer day, no clouds at all in the middle of summer.
[03:39.210 --> 03:44.530]  That's the brightest day of the year and hemp benefits from that.
[03:44.530 --> 03:46.450]  You don't always have to grow it here.
[03:46.450 --> 03:52.330]  It'll grow fine down around 30, but if you want to get maximum yield, we need to push
[03:52.330 --> 03:55.370]  it hard with light.
[03:55.370 --> 04:00.450]  And if we push it hard with light, we have to optimize everything else.
[04:00.450 --> 04:05.530]  So let's look at the calculations for this.
[04:05.530 --> 04:11.970]  When we measure light, we take an ordinary quantum sensor and measure it.
[04:11.970 --> 04:27.690]  And if you just have a quantum sensor with a meter, you're going to get a unit of micromoles
[04:27.690 --> 04:36.970]  of photons per meter squared of area per second.
[04:36.970 --> 04:41.650]  This is the standard unit from quantum sensors.
[04:41.650 --> 04:49.810]  And what the I in integral means is add this up over a whole day.
[04:49.810 --> 04:56.050]  So if we take a quantum sensor and we measure 1,000.
[04:56.210 --> 04:58.010]  Now this is bright, bright light.
[04:58.010 --> 05:03.210]  This is pushing the plant hard with light.
[05:03.210 --> 05:14.970]  To get to over here, we're going to get to moles per meter squared per day.
[05:14.970 --> 05:19.130]  And this is what's called daily light integral.
[05:19.130 --> 05:21.770]  And the way we get there is just add up the seconds.
[05:21.930 --> 05:26.530]  So here's 3,600 seconds per hour.
[05:26.530 --> 05:31.290]  And so we multiply those together and you can see 1,000 times 3,000.
[05:31.290 --> 05:42.410]  We get 3.6 times 10 to the sixth micromoles per meter squared per second.
[05:42.410 --> 05:46.450]  Now 10 to the six micromoles is one mole.
[05:46.450 --> 05:48.730]  Micro is 10 to the minus sixth.
[05:48.770 --> 05:51.690]  So this is 3.6.
[05:51.690 --> 05:56.050]  Sorry, this is per hour right here.
[05:56.050 --> 05:58.170]  The seconds canceled.
[05:58.170 --> 06:05.610]  3.6 moles per meter squared per hour.
[06:05.610 --> 06:13.570]  In the world of cannabis, we need short days to get the plants to flower and make good
[06:13.570 --> 06:15.170]  flower buds.
[06:15.170 --> 06:22.690]  And to do that, I think most people know to be safe, we go with 12 hour photo period.
[06:22.690 --> 06:26.970]  So now we multiply these together, 12 hours.
[06:26.970 --> 06:38.810]  12 times 3.6 is 43.2 moles per meter squared per day.
[06:38.810 --> 06:44.410]  This is how you get the daily light integral after you measure this.
[06:44.410 --> 06:51.770]  Now used to be you had to do some math after you did this to calculate this.
[06:51.770 --> 07:01.450]  But because this is so important, companies have developed instruments to add it up continuously.
[07:01.450 --> 07:05.390]  And here's one made by Apogee Instruments.
[07:05.390 --> 07:06.890]  It's connected to this device.
[07:06.890 --> 07:09.250]  This is a quantum sensor.
[07:09.250 --> 07:13.970]  And this adds up, measures the light and adds it up.
[07:14.210 --> 07:17.010]  Because it's Bluetooth, shows it on your phone.
[07:17.010 --> 07:24.730]  And what this is showing is the daily light integral each day.
[07:24.730 --> 07:28.030]  And this was outside recently.
[07:28.030 --> 07:30.850]  So you can see we got up to 35.
[07:30.850 --> 07:35.050]  This is in the spring of the year, cloudy days are five.
[07:35.050 --> 07:41.450]  Inside, we'd have constant light.
[07:41.450 --> 07:43.610]  It also does photo period.
[07:43.610 --> 07:49.770]  Now this is really critical because we want 12 hours.
[07:49.770 --> 07:54.050]  And at night, we don't want any light pollution.
[07:54.050 --> 08:02.710]  A little bit of light leaking in can cause cannabis to not flower at all or flower poorly.
[08:02.710 --> 08:06.210]  So this instrument is like a silent sentinel.
[08:06.210 --> 08:10.850]  It's watching all the time, make sure the light is correct in the day and make sure
[08:11.090 --> 08:14.610]  it's off and dark at night.
[08:14.610 --> 08:17.450]  So this shows a whole bunch of screens.
[08:17.450 --> 08:24.810]  I'm not going to go through them all, but it collects data and summarizes it for you.
[08:24.810 --> 08:32.770]  So this is, in addition to this instrument, how hard can we push the plants?
[08:32.770 --> 08:35.770]  A thousand gave us 43.
[08:35.770 --> 08:36.770]  Now that's fine.
[08:36.770 --> 08:39.250]  We can grow fine cannabis with that.
[08:39.250 --> 08:44.570]  But if we want to push it, we're going to need to go up to 60.
[08:44.570 --> 08:46.530]  Now look what happens.
[08:46.530 --> 08:57.130]  If we increase this to 1500 micromoles, everything increases by 1.5.
[08:57.130 --> 09:05.770]  We take this times 1.5 and that's, let's see, that's going to be 43 plus 22.
[09:05.770 --> 09:15.330]  It's going to be 62, about 62 micromoles per meter squared per second.
[09:15.330 --> 09:22.090]  Now we're up to where we're pushing it hard and we get very high yields, but boy, the
[09:22.090 --> 09:26.010]  other inputs also have to be optimal.
[09:26.010 --> 09:29.230]  That's why the rest of these parameters are so important.
[09:29.230 --> 09:42.340]  So I'm going to put near maximum.
[09:42.340 --> 09:48.740]  Now we've done studies in the laboratory at 2000 and yield keeps going up at 2000, but
[09:48.740 --> 09:49.740]  that's getting really high.
[09:49.740 --> 09:54.460]  It's hard to keep everything watered.
[09:54.460 --> 09:56.220]  So here's the light level.
[09:56.220 --> 09:59.580]  You want to pinpoint this to make sure it's there.
[09:59.580 --> 10:01.900]  The light level is a lot like a speedometer in the car.
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.780]  If you're going to take this car out for a fast drive, you sure as heck want an accurate
[10:05.780 --> 10:09.660]  speedometer in it to know exactly how fast you're going.
[10:09.660 --> 10:14.820]  Of course, you've got a lot of other gauges too, but it starts with getting the light
[10:14.820 --> 10:16.900]  exactly right.
[10:16.900 --> 10:23.780]  It's possible to measure light with a foot candle meter or a lux meter, but those can
[10:23.780 --> 10:27.140]  lead to big errors.
[10:27.140 --> 10:32.220]  You need to calibrate them against a good quantum sensor.
[10:32.220 --> 10:41.180]  There's a lot of stories of people having troubles with lux meters and it can lead to
[10:41.180 --> 10:45.380]  a difficulty in the crop.
[10:45.380 --> 10:47.260]  Let's go through the other parameters here.
[10:47.260 --> 10:51.780]  If we're going to push this crop hard with a lot of light.
[10:51.780 --> 10:54.620]  Temperature.
[10:54.620 --> 11:07.420]  The temperature curve is about, I'm going to put 26 to 29 Celsius, and now I have to
[11:07.420 --> 11:09.340]  convert this.
[11:09.340 --> 11:13.580]  This is going to, let me change this a little bit here.
[11:13.580 --> 11:17.580]  Make it round numbers.
[11:17.580 --> 11:31.220]  Let's do 25 to 30 degrees C, and in Fahrenheit that's 77 to 86 F.
[11:31.220 --> 11:41.940]  This is a broad range, and in this range you're going to have pretty optimal conditions.
[11:41.940 --> 11:46.220]  When you have a lot of light, you're going to have some cooling or you're going to go
[11:46.220 --> 11:51.980]  hotter than 86, and that's definitely not good.
[11:51.980 --> 11:55.300]  Now let's look at humidity in these conditions.
[11:55.300 --> 12:01.660]  The plants produce a lot of humidity, and the key for the humidity is blowing the humidity
[12:01.660 --> 12:02.660]  out.
[12:02.660 --> 12:09.100]  If we were to draw, I could probably put this up here, but here's a light box.
[12:09.100 --> 12:10.500]  Here's our plant down here.
[12:10.500 --> 12:13.460]  I'm going to put the plant on this in green.
[12:13.700 --> 12:14.700]  Growing.
[12:14.700 --> 12:17.580]  It's a big plant.
[12:17.580 --> 12:22.940]  This plant's putting an enormous amount of water into the air when the lights, I'm going
[12:22.940 --> 12:26.180]  to put H2O here, H2O.
[12:26.180 --> 12:36.040]  So you want to have some kind of a vent like this to have the air come in and blow out.
[12:36.040 --> 12:41.660]  Most of the time the humidity is too high, and that leads to powdery mildew, leads to
[12:41.660 --> 12:42.860]  diseases.
[12:42.860 --> 12:52.880]  So the optimal humidity is really, exactly optimal, might be 60%, but that's a pretty
[12:52.880 --> 12:53.880]  broad optimal.
[12:53.880 --> 13:02.260]  You can grow fine plants from 40 to maybe 70% as long as you don't get disease up at
[13:02.260 --> 13:04.660]  the high end of this.
[13:04.660 --> 13:09.700]  So that's humidity, and we're venting this to blow it out.
[13:09.700 --> 13:16.340]  At the same time we're venting this, number one, it's cooling the plant by venting, which
[13:16.340 --> 13:21.000]  is important with all this light to have lots of ventilation.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.680]  And one way to tell the ventilation is put your plant in and measure the temperature
[13:26.840 --> 13:34.400]  and keep enough ventilation so you don't get above 30 Celsius or 85 Fahrenheit, and
[13:34.400 --> 13:35.400]  humidity.
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.720]  Same thing, get a humidity meter, put them by the vent, make sure you don't get too high
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.800]  humidity.
[13:42.800 --> 13:49.200]  Wind is, you can get anemometers to measure wind, but generally you just want plenty of
[13:49.200 --> 13:50.240]  air flow.
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.600]  If the leaves are moving slightly, that's a good air flow.
[13:54.600 --> 14:00.520]  That's around a meter a second wind speed, and that's what you want to maintain for this.
[14:00.520 --> 14:11.040]  CO2, we've known for, since photosynthesis was discovered, that CO2 improves crop growth.
[14:11.040 --> 14:17.800]  In the laboratory we can enrich CO2, in big commercial operations we enrich CO2.
[14:17.800 --> 14:20.560]  It's complicated to enrich at home.
[14:20.560 --> 14:30.400]  So we rarely enrich at home, but we're breathing out a lot of CO2 in the house anyway.
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.440]  And the pilot light in a water heater gives out a lot of CO2.
[14:34.440 --> 14:40.500]  I measured CO2, carbon dioxide, in my house, and some years ago I found the house never
[14:40.500 --> 14:46.400]  went down to ambient CO2, and after a lot of testing I finally found out it was the
[14:46.480 --> 14:52.520]  pilot light in my water heater that was enriching CO2 in the entire house.
[14:52.520 --> 15:00.600]  It's beneficial to enrich with CO2, but it's certainly not necessary to grow a great crop.
[15:00.600 --> 15:08.200]  Ambient CO2 is now about 400 parts per million.
[15:08.200 --> 15:15.640]  And the challenge with CO2 is to keep it from going below 400.
[15:15.640 --> 15:24.280]  And again, if the ventilation is not adequate, the CO2 for a plant is like oxygen for people.
[15:24.280 --> 15:27.240]  So the water vapor is coming out.
[15:27.240 --> 15:30.840]  Let's put CO2 as black in chemistry.
[15:30.840 --> 15:33.920]  So we're going to put CO2, carbon as black.
[15:33.920 --> 15:36.000]  The CO2 is going in.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.560]  If you don't have enough ventilation, you deplete the CO2 and the plant's basically
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.720]  suffocating.
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.360]  So make sure we get plenty of ventilation to keep the humidity low, the temperature
[15:46.360 --> 15:55.720]  low, and then the CO2 will automatically be close to 400, and that's adequate.
[15:55.720 --> 16:03.480]  Some years ago I did a TED talk called Turning Water into Food, and that TED talk was about
[16:03.480 --> 16:06.780]  how much water plants really need.
[16:06.780 --> 16:08.920]  Now TED talks are 15 minutes long.
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.440]  I had to take a lot of stuff out to make it fit, but I'm going to show you something that
[16:13.440 --> 16:17.040]  got cut from that TED talk.
[16:17.040 --> 16:23.080]  This is back from high school or beginning college chemistry.
[16:23.080 --> 16:29.840]  These beads represent the ratio of gases in our atmosphere.
[16:29.840 --> 16:33.960]  And if you know a little bit about the atmosphere, most of it's nitrogen.
[16:33.960 --> 16:38.380]  So this one is 80% nitrogen.
[16:38.380 --> 16:40.980]  This is an inert gas.
[16:40.980 --> 16:44.500]  It's 79, 80% of our atmosphere.
[16:44.500 --> 16:46.740]  What's the next biggest gas?
[16:46.740 --> 16:48.300]  Oxygen.
[16:48.300 --> 16:54.100]  So 20% of the air is oxygen, shown here in red.
[16:54.100 --> 16:59.980]  Then we go, let's take this one out for a minute.
[16:59.980 --> 17:04.480]  These four beads, this one there's 10,000 beads here.
[17:04.480 --> 17:07.260]  This is carbon dioxide.
[17:07.260 --> 17:12.140]  This is what the plants have to work with to grow.
[17:12.140 --> 17:16.460]  If these four beads go to three beads, the plant growth suffers.
[17:16.460 --> 17:23.340]  You want plenty of aeration going through your grow tent to make sure it's adequate.
[17:23.340 --> 17:27.360]  This one's water vapor, blue.
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.620]  There's quite a bit more water vapor than CO2, but here's the key point.
[17:32.620 --> 17:36.580]  Humans need oxygen, and we got a lot of oxygen for us.
[17:36.900 --> 17:39.140]  Plants need CO2, and they hardly have any.
[17:39.140 --> 17:47.300]  And that's the whole reason that good supply of air is critical to that plant.
[17:47.300 --> 17:51.480]  It's almost like you can't have a fan that's too big in here.
[17:51.480 --> 17:55.060]  But at some point, it's a waste of electricity.
[17:55.060 --> 18:01.580]  I would just measure temperature and humidity and keep those down because, drawing a scale
[18:01.580 --> 18:06.700]  drawing here, here's the lights.
[18:06.700 --> 18:11.320]  And in this box, all day long, they're putting a lot of light in.
[18:11.320 --> 18:14.580]  That's driving the water, driving the temperature.
[18:14.580 --> 18:18.260]  You want to blow those out.
[18:18.260 --> 18:23.580]  One key thing about light, the plants need to be dark at night.
[18:23.580 --> 18:31.100]  Now most people line this with silver or mylar, let the light reflect in, black on the outside.
[18:31.700 --> 18:35.380]  You want to make sure this is dark at night.
[18:35.380 --> 18:40.500]  If there's light pollution, somebody turns on a light and it leaks in, your plants could
[18:40.500 --> 18:45.580]  not, they might not flower properly, or they might not have good yield.
[18:45.580 --> 18:52.220]  For this reason, another thing Apogee developed, it's this sensor here, was a light pollution
[18:52.220 --> 18:53.300]  detector.
[18:53.300 --> 18:55.900]  And it's really sensitive to low levels of light.
[18:56.220 --> 19:01.980]  The same as the other one, only it detects trace amounts of light contamination.
[19:01.980 --> 19:07.340]  That's to keep it good and dark because here's 12 hours of light.
[19:07.340 --> 19:11.540]  That means 12 hours of dark.
[19:11.540 --> 19:16.980]  Now by the way, we're studying lines that might take 13 hours, maybe 14 hours of light.
[19:16.980 --> 19:23.420]  But for now, to be on the safe side, 12 hours of light and dark.
[19:23.420 --> 19:29.980]  To optimize yield, you want to decide, you want to make a good decision about when to
[19:29.980 --> 19:39.940]  go from vegetative growth, or what we call veg, to reproductive growth.
[19:39.940 --> 19:46.660]  And typically this is 18, up to 24 hours.
[19:46.660 --> 19:51.940]  24 hours doesn't hurt the plants, it might not be used quite as efficiently, but you
[19:51.940 --> 20:02.380]  want a long photo period until you get a big plant, and then you go into reproductive.
[20:02.380 --> 20:12.540]  And after that point, it's about, not 12 weeks, it's about 8 weeks till harvest.
[20:12.540 --> 20:16.500]  So I brought a couple of plants in here to show you.
[20:16.500 --> 20:19.740]  These are some that we're doing research on.
[20:19.740 --> 20:25.180]  Here's a young plant, this gets this big, and that depends on again, on the light level.
[20:25.180 --> 20:31.580]  But it could get this big two weeks after, depending on what you start from, but after
[20:31.580 --> 20:35.300]  you start from a rooted cutting.
[20:35.300 --> 20:40.420]  If we gave this plant 12 hours right now, it would start to flower and it would never
[20:40.420 --> 20:41.420]  get very big.
[20:41.420 --> 20:44.380]  It would have a fine yield, it would just never get very big.
[20:44.380 --> 20:54.500]  So what we do is keep it on 18 hour long days and boom, now it gets big and now if
[20:54.500 --> 21:00.660]  we give it short days at this point, we're going to have a lot of yield on one single
[21:00.660 --> 21:01.660]  plant.
[21:01.660 --> 21:09.820]  The point here is gauge when to switch to short days, to short 12 hour days.
[21:09.820 --> 21:14.380]  Make sure your plant's big enough to fill the space.
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.100]  If you switch too early, you'll reduce yield.
[21:17.100 --> 21:23.620]  If you switch too late, the plant just gets too enormous, bigger than you can handle.
[21:23.620 --> 21:28.820]  Most plants increase in size about 30% after switch.
[21:28.820 --> 21:34.780]  So this one, maybe even double in size.
[21:34.780 --> 21:36.900]  This one might get this big when it's done.
[21:36.980 --> 21:39.980]  This one would be enormous when it flowers.
[21:39.980 --> 21:46.540]  All right, that's photo period.
[21:46.540 --> 21:48.980]  We talked about light intensity.
[21:48.980 --> 21:52.980]  There's lots of choices for lights to get the intensity high.
[21:52.980 --> 21:59.700]  You absolutely have to measure it so you know what you're dealing with.
[21:59.700 --> 22:06.140]  We've already talked about all the blue labels in the foliar environment, but if you do not
[22:06.380 --> 22:12.500]  have an optimal root zone environment, you're going to have yellow leaves, discolored leaves,
[22:12.500 --> 22:21.300]  purple leaves, and that's why I want to focus a bit on the root zone here.
[22:21.300 --> 22:26.580]  Temperature in the root zone, about the same as the top.
[22:26.580 --> 22:32.700]  It's really 26 to 30 degrees C for temperature.
[22:33.260 --> 22:41.260]  Oxygen, nutrients, and water all have to be optimal, particularly if we're driving the plant hard.
[22:41.260 --> 22:51.060]  Now, let's go over here and I'll show you the media that we use in the research laboratory.
[22:51.060 --> 22:54.340]  These are some media components.
[22:54.340 --> 23:01.620]  Lots of people sell media for cannabis and lots of people claim they have a special media.
[23:01.620 --> 23:12.220]  We make our own from simple ingredients and we have done 30 years of study on media components now.
[23:12.220 --> 23:18.700]  This is the media we use here in the research laboratory and I'm going to put it up here
[23:18.700 --> 23:22.340]  and then I'll talk about options for that.
[23:22.340 --> 23:25.060]  Let's see, we'll put that in brown.
[23:25.060 --> 23:41.900]  It is 50% peat, 50% vermiculite.
[23:41.900 --> 23:45.540]  So I think most people know what peat looks like.
[23:45.540 --> 23:48.140]  Not everybody knows what vermiculite looks like.
[23:48.140 --> 23:52.020]  There's some other additives, we'll get to those, but these are the primary ingredients.
[23:52.020 --> 23:53.020]  Here's peat.
[23:53.340 --> 23:56.060]  Same, you can buy this at any hardware store.
[23:56.060 --> 23:59.300]  In North America, it almost always comes from Canada.
[23:59.300 --> 24:01.860]  This is a great media.
[24:01.860 --> 24:07.540]  In the United Kingdom, they're really trying to crack down on minimal use of peat and they
[24:07.540 --> 24:16.780]  go on to many other things, but in North America, growers typically start with peat in the media.
[24:16.780 --> 24:21.460]  Some substitutes for peat are ground-up wood.
[24:21.460 --> 24:28.220]  This is a product called Hydrafiber, which is a shredded wood product and this can be
[24:28.220 --> 24:35.180]  used as a substitute for peat or as an additive to peat.
[24:35.180 --> 24:36.660]  Here's vermiculite.
[24:36.660 --> 24:37.660]  Here's the container.
[24:37.660 --> 24:41.300]  I could put this on a slope.
[24:41.300 --> 24:48.100]  This was and still is sometimes widely used for building insulation, but this is mica
[24:48.100 --> 24:51.140]  that's mined and heated and puffed up.
[24:51.820 --> 24:59.740]  It's not widely used by commercial growers of ornamental plants because it's expensive.
[24:59.740 --> 25:06.060]  They used to use it years ago, but as it became expensive, they switched to perlite, which
[25:06.060 --> 25:10.980]  is also widely available in stores.
[25:10.980 --> 25:15.780]  You can also use perlite, but peat is a little better.
[25:15.820 --> 25:21.980]  When you're pushing plants for optimal yields, we like to use peat and perlite.
[25:21.980 --> 25:41.510]  Let me put vermiculite or perlite or shredded wood.
[25:41.510 --> 25:49.470]  The brand name that's widely available is called Hydrafiber.
[25:49.470 --> 25:55.110]  We've done a lot of research on that in this lab and it's a good product.
[25:55.110 --> 25:59.870]  But again, peat is the base and we've got a lot of additives to it.
[25:59.870 --> 26:06.390]  I should mention, it's not a tray, coconut coir.
[26:06.390 --> 26:14.110]  It's a strange name that spells coconut, C-O-I-R.
[26:14.110 --> 26:17.390]  Some people pronounce it coir, some people pronounce it coir.
[26:17.390 --> 26:20.510]  It's shredded coconuts.
[26:20.510 --> 26:22.870]  This used to have a lot of problems.
[26:22.870 --> 26:25.270]  Twenty years ago, we did a lot of research on this.
[26:25.270 --> 26:29.550]  The companies that make it have really done a good job cleaning it up and the quality
[26:29.550 --> 26:33.430]  is much higher than it was.
[26:33.470 --> 26:43.710]  Coconut coir is a fine additive for a media as well, but we use peat and vermiculite because
[26:43.710 --> 26:48.110]  we want the absolute premium media.
[26:48.110 --> 26:51.950]  Vermiculite has exceptionally good water holding capacity.
[26:51.950 --> 26:55.630]  It has exceptionally good cation exchange capacity.
[26:55.630 --> 26:58.430]  That means ability to hold nutrients.
[26:58.430 --> 27:10.030]  It provides, this is huge for cannabis, S-I-L-I-C-A, silica.
[27:10.030 --> 27:16.830]  All those little trichomes in cannabis are full of silica on the leaves and more than
[27:16.830 --> 27:21.750]  other crops, cannabis benefits from silica.
[27:21.750 --> 27:26.950]  If you use vermiculite, you automatically get lots of silica.
[27:26.950 --> 27:30.990]  These other products don't have any silica.
[27:30.990 --> 27:35.510]  So if you use one of these other products, you should find an additive of silica and
[27:35.510 --> 27:39.430]  add it to the media or just use vermiculite.
[27:39.430 --> 27:44.950]  There's several sources of silica products to add.
[27:44.950 --> 27:48.790]  Now let's talk about what we add to this media.
[27:48.790 --> 27:56.750]  Here in our research lab, and again, this is the result of lots of studies, peat comes
[27:57.190 --> 27:59.190]  pretty acid.
[27:59.190 --> 28:08.110]  The pH of peat is about, it depends on the peat, but I'm going to put 3.8.
[28:08.110 --> 28:09.910]  That's pretty acid peat.
[28:09.910 --> 28:17.390]  Another benefit of vermiculite is it's alkaline and you mix them together and this automatically,
[28:17.670 --> 28:27.470]  plus V-E-R-M, vermiculite, this goes to about 4.5.
[28:27.470 --> 28:31.950]  It's still acid, but it's a lot better than straight peat.
[28:31.950 --> 28:42.830]  So to help get this in the optimal range, we add, it's hard to see this, lime.
[28:42.830 --> 28:45.790]  This is just a powder.
[28:45.790 --> 28:47.730]  It's added east of the Mississippi.
[28:47.730 --> 28:51.030]  It's added to fields all the time.
[28:51.030 --> 29:02.950]  And in particular, we add dolomitic lime, which gives us some magnesium.
[29:02.950 --> 29:05.990]  I'm running out of room.
[29:05.990 --> 29:21.440]  Let's put this, plus lime, and I'm going to put comma dolomitic.
[29:21.440 --> 29:27.760]  And dolomitic is a unique kind of lime that has both calcium and magnesium.
[29:27.760 --> 29:28.760]  We add that.
[29:28.760 --> 29:33.280]  I've got to look at this to make sure I got my notes right.
[29:33.280 --> 29:41.360]  We've got 40 grams per cubic foot.
[29:41.360 --> 29:48.280]  Now I know this is mixed units, metric and feet, but grams is easy to measure.
[29:48.280 --> 29:50.240]  I brought in my household scale.
[29:50.240 --> 29:53.040]  If you don't own one of these, buy one.
[29:53.040 --> 29:54.040]  Buy two or three.
[29:54.040 --> 29:55.040]  They're cheap.
[29:55.040 --> 29:59.560]  It's easy to measure the weight of your fertilizer on this.
[29:59.560 --> 30:06.480]  Here's a little jar, one that I brought from home of the blue powder fertilizer.
[30:06.480 --> 30:09.600]  You weigh everything out on this.
[30:09.600 --> 30:11.200]  Forty grams of lime.
[30:11.200 --> 30:21.480]  This brings the pH up to about 5.5, and that's near optimum.
[30:21.480 --> 30:24.200]  And it adds calcium and magnesium to the mix.
[30:24.200 --> 30:29.320]  And just mix it in, into the meaty as you make it.
[30:30.080 --> 30:32.680]  There's one other thing we add.
[30:32.680 --> 30:34.360]  I'm running out of room.
[30:34.360 --> 30:38.440]  I put it down here.
[30:38.440 --> 30:42.760]  Gypsum.
[30:42.760 --> 30:53.600]  Gypsum is a common agricultural product, and it is calcium sulfate, CaSO4, if you had chemistry.
[30:53.600 --> 30:57.280]  This adds additional calcium, which is good.
[30:57.280 --> 31:01.320]  Many places have inadequate calcium in the tap water.
[31:01.320 --> 31:03.360]  And it adds sulfur.
[31:03.360 --> 31:09.360]  Here in Utah, we have low sulfur in our water, so we put gypsum into the media.
[31:09.360 --> 31:12.000]  And again, you can buy this in many places.
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.680]  And we use a pelletized gypsum.
[31:13.680 --> 31:16.200]  It looks like this.
[31:16.200 --> 31:22.800]  Add that to the media, and it's really slow release over a period of many months.
[31:22.800 --> 31:26.560]  And you don't need nearly as much gypsum.
[31:26.960 --> 31:32.560]  10 grams per cubic foot.
[31:32.560 --> 31:33.560]  And I think you can...
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.560]  It doesn't...
[31:34.560 --> 31:35.560]  These are not precise.
[31:35.560 --> 31:38.880]  You can be off 10%, and it's just fine.
[31:38.880 --> 31:41.600]  I think you can visualize a cubic foot.
[31:41.600 --> 31:51.320]  If we wanted to do this all metric, a cubic foot is 28.3 liters per cubic foot.
[31:51.320 --> 31:54.760]  And now you can convert to all metric.
[31:54.760 --> 31:59.720]  So, there's a lot of options.
[31:59.720 --> 32:07.000]  The one we like the best for an absolute premium media is peat vermiculite with 40 grams per
[32:07.000 --> 32:13.640]  cubic foot of lime and 10 grams per cubic foot of gypsum.
[32:13.640 --> 32:14.880]  Now we're ready to go.
[32:14.880 --> 32:16.360]  We got our container.
[32:16.360 --> 32:21.680]  Let's put the container down here.
[32:21.680 --> 32:24.400]  Something like this.
[32:24.400 --> 32:32.440]  You can see these containers over here that we use to grow the plants.
[32:32.440 --> 32:38.960]  Here's our container with our media in it.
[32:38.960 --> 32:45.360]  We keep this pretty fluffy to get plenty of oxygen.
[32:45.360 --> 32:53.040]  To be sure you have enough oxygen, you can buy an oxygen sensor.
[32:53.280 --> 32:57.840]  Apogee Instruments sells an oxygen sensor to put in here.
[32:57.840 --> 33:04.440]  That helps you make sure you got plenty of oxygen in your growth media.
[33:04.440 --> 33:09.340]  This media is so fluffy that it's hard to overwater it.
[33:09.340 --> 33:11.220]  The water will drain out.
[33:11.220 --> 33:17.940]  You want to be sure you have a tray under this because we're going to want to flush
[33:17.940 --> 33:22.560]  some of the nutrient solution through this.
[33:23.080 --> 33:31.600]  Now let's put in red nutrients.
[33:31.600 --> 33:34.120]  We're going to put nutrients in here.
[33:34.120 --> 33:37.880]  What do we use for nutrients?
[33:37.880 --> 33:40.480]  Many companies sell special nutrients.
[33:40.480 --> 33:43.520]  We have tested many things over the years.
[33:43.520 --> 33:47.240]  I teach a class in principles of plant nutrition.
[33:47.240 --> 33:52.240]  It uses this big heavy textbook, mineral nutrition of higher plants.
[33:52.920 --> 33:59.640]  We've analyzed nutrients a lot and we've done many tests here.
[33:59.640 --> 34:07.520]  We have found we use the same fertilizer that we use for all of our other plants.
[34:07.520 --> 34:12.120]  Wheat plants, corn plants, tomato plants.
[34:12.120 --> 34:18.320]  We can recommend a general fertilizer that works well for this.
[34:18.400 --> 34:24.080]  Fertilizers come with three numbers, N, P, and K.
[34:24.080 --> 34:30.760]  The one we use is 20-10-20.
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.200]  Has less phosphorus.
[34:32.200 --> 34:36.880]  Plants need less phosphorus than nitrogen and potassium.
[34:36.880 --> 34:45.320]  This ratio gives us ample nutrients provided we're slightly overwatering.
[34:45.320 --> 34:52.320]  What it really means is about 10% of the water comes out the bottom and you want to
[34:52.320 --> 34:56.520]  catch it and put it on your lawn, put it somewhere else.
[34:56.520 --> 35:01.240]  It's still fine fertilizer, but when this fertilizer is running through, it helps to
[35:01.240 --> 35:04.160]  ensure that there's plenty of nutrients.
[35:04.160 --> 35:06.680]  It's possible to do this with no leaching.
[35:06.680 --> 35:09.480]  It just gets trickier.
[35:09.480 --> 35:14.440]  So how much of this do we put in to the mix?
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.640]  Here's another instrument that you really benefit from.
[35:20.640 --> 35:23.800]  This is an electrical conductivity meter.
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.800]  This particular one sold by Hanna Instruments.
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.300]  We use these a lot.
[35:30.300 --> 35:35.160]  The more salt in the water, the higher the electrical conductivity.
[35:35.160 --> 35:43.760]  You can tell if your nutrient solution is optimal by measuring this.
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.720]  Let me do a little demo for you.
[35:46.720 --> 35:48.720]  Turn it on.
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.840]  I made two beakers.
[35:50.840 --> 35:56.880]  Let's put them right in the front.
[35:56.880 --> 36:03.160]  In fact, I want to put these on a piece of white paper because we're going to make a
[36:03.160 --> 36:09.950]  little demo.
[36:09.950 --> 36:13.170]  See the difference in color?
[36:13.170 --> 36:19.730]  This is tap water and this is our nutrient solution.
[36:19.730 --> 36:23.330]  It has a blue dye in it so you can tell when it's there.
[36:23.330 --> 36:27.090]  It should be just perceptible, very light blue.
[36:27.090 --> 36:31.650]  So we put this in tap water.
[36:31.650 --> 36:35.210]  Depends on what part of the country, what part of the world you live in.
[36:35.330 --> 36:41.250]  But tap water is about 0.4.
[36:41.250 --> 36:44.650]  Tap water.
[36:44.650 --> 36:49.170]  0.4.
[36:49.170 --> 36:54.730]  And the units on this are millisiemens per meter.
[36:54.730 --> 37:01.010]  Now units are a little bit messy in this because different meters have different units.
[37:01.010 --> 37:03.370]  But here's tap water.
[37:03.370 --> 37:05.490]  Now look what happens with the fertilizer.
[37:05.490 --> 37:08.610]  This is very dilute fertilizer.
[37:08.610 --> 37:09.610]  Put this in here.
[37:09.610 --> 37:10.610]  Stir it a second.
[37:10.610 --> 37:13.650]  I don't know if you can see it on the screen.
[37:13.650 --> 37:16.810]  1.27.
[37:16.810 --> 37:18.870]  This is 0.4.
[37:18.870 --> 37:19.870]  This is 1.27.
[37:19.870 --> 37:29.250]  And I'm going to put about 1.3 nutrient solution.
[37:29.250 --> 37:35.970]  The reason this is important is you can measure the electrical conductivity of this water
[37:35.970 --> 37:37.690]  that you collect.
[37:37.690 --> 37:45.130]  And if this water is between 1 and 1.5, you know your plants are doing well.
[37:45.130 --> 37:46.430]  They're doing great.
[37:46.430 --> 37:53.890]  If you don't water enough, this gets too high and they have too many nutrients.
[37:53.890 --> 37:57.170]  Or if it's a big plant, it could be too low too.
[37:57.170 --> 38:09.050]  So you want to put 1.3 in the top and water enough so this is about 1.3 coming out the
[38:09.050 --> 38:10.050]  bottom.
[38:10.050 --> 38:16.250]  And you measure that with an electrical conductivity meter.
[38:16.250 --> 38:24.170]  This is the fertilizer ratio to get this.
[38:24.170 --> 38:26.690]  I'm running out of room.
[38:27.210 --> 38:30.370]  I'm going to have to calculate it because I can't remember the number off the top of
[38:30.370 --> 38:31.470]  my head.
[38:31.470 --> 38:43.290]  This is 20% N and we're going to want to get about 120 ppm N.
[38:43.290 --> 38:47.810]  This is the optimum level of fertilizer.
[38:47.810 --> 38:58.890]  So 120 ppm is 120 milligrams of N per liter.
[38:58.890 --> 39:03.770]  A part per million is exactly the same as a milligram per liter.
[39:03.770 --> 39:08.250]  If you do this, you're going to end up with an honorary degree in horticulture if you
[39:08.250 --> 39:10.090]  learn to do this math.
[39:10.090 --> 39:16.010]  The fertilizer is only 20%.
[39:16.010 --> 39:28.730]  So this is 0.2 grams of N per one gram.
[39:28.730 --> 39:33.690]  I'm going to call this blue because it's the blue fertilizer.
[39:33.690 --> 39:46.490]  So 120 over 0.2 is 600 milligrams per liter.
[39:46.490 --> 39:53.210]  You can see here that, take this times 5.
[39:53.210 --> 40:02.410]  So 600 milligrams per liter equals 6.
[40:02.410 --> 40:03.410]  Hold on.
[40:03.410 --> 40:13.660]  120 ppm.
[40:13.660 --> 40:20.460]  This is 0.6 grams per liter.
[40:20.460 --> 40:27.900]  This is grams of blue powder, blue fertilizer.
[40:27.900 --> 40:29.460]  There's the optimum rate.
[40:29.460 --> 40:31.140]  Now it doesn't have to be exact.
[40:31.140 --> 40:32.140]  It's close to this.
[40:32.140 --> 40:39.740]  But when I did this study over there with EC, I put in 0.6 grams per liter of blue powder.
[40:39.740 --> 40:42.020]  You don't need to know how to derive it.
[40:42.020 --> 40:43.620]  Just write down that number.
[40:43.620 --> 40:48.220]  But the instructions come with that on the fertilizer.
[40:48.220 --> 40:56.620]  Let me show you briefly the vast array of fertilizers that commercial growers use.
[40:56.620 --> 40:57.620]  This is my folder.
[40:57.620 --> 41:01.640]  Now I know everybody looks this stuff up on the internet, but I grew up in a time before
[41:01.640 --> 41:02.940]  the internet.
[41:02.940 --> 41:05.020]  So I still use paper.
[41:05.020 --> 41:08.820]  Here's one of the charts with all the fertilizers used.
[41:08.820 --> 41:10.980]  These are called Jack's fertilizers.
[41:10.980 --> 41:13.060]  There's Peter's fertilizers.
[41:13.060 --> 41:18.500]  These are all specialty fertilizers for specialty applications.
[41:18.500 --> 41:23.180]  To my knowledge, these guys aren't marketing a special cannabis fertilizer at the moment.
[41:23.180 --> 41:26.580]  But if they did, they should be selling 2010-20.
[41:26.580 --> 41:32.860]  Because after a lot of analysis, this is what we've gone to here.
[41:32.860 --> 41:36.940]  These are sold by many companies.
[41:36.940 --> 41:39.420]  Peter's fertilizer is a famous brand name.
[41:39.420 --> 41:42.580]  Jack's is essentially the same thing.
[41:43.260 --> 41:45.220]  They're available in stores.
[41:45.220 --> 41:48.220]  You can buy these in small packets.
[41:48.220 --> 41:52.900]  We buy them in 25-pound bags, a whole pallet load of them, because we're going through
[41:52.900 --> 41:53.900]  a lot of them.
[41:53.900 --> 42:01.700]  But this is the ratio of fertilizer applied at this concentration to get, and you're going
[42:01.700 --> 42:09.180]  to buy an EC meter to make sure you didn't make a math error, to get about 1.2 to 1.3
[42:09.180 --> 42:10.740]  of your EC.
[42:10.900 --> 42:13.620]  And a very slight blue color.
[42:13.620 --> 42:19.940]  After a while, you get so good, you can tell the EC from looking at the color.
[42:19.940 --> 42:27.540]  If you don't want to fertilize daily, it is possible to put in a slow-release fertilizer.
[42:27.540 --> 42:28.540]  Here's some pellets.
[42:28.540 --> 42:31.300]  This is a product called Nutri-Coat.
[42:31.300 --> 42:36.780]  You can put these, and these come in various release rates.
[42:36.820 --> 42:42.500]  They're not as precise as watering each day with fertilizer like this.
[42:42.500 --> 42:47.580]  But for some kinds of studies, if there's reasons you can't do a liquid feed or a straight
[42:47.580 --> 42:55.010]  hydroponics, you can put slow-release fertilizer in the bucket.
[42:55.010 --> 42:56.410]  Water.
[42:59.530 --> 43:04.330]  You got to learn how often you have to water.
[43:04.370 --> 43:08.010]  When the plant gets big, let's go back to these plants.
[43:08.010 --> 43:10.530]  It depends on the light.
[43:10.530 --> 43:13.630]  The higher the light, the more you have to water.
[43:13.630 --> 43:18.730]  This plant, at 1,000 micromoles per meter squared per second, we could probably water
[43:18.730 --> 43:22.770]  it once every three days.
[43:22.770 --> 43:27.170]  How often do you think we need to water this plant if there's 1,000 micromoles?
[43:27.170 --> 43:28.610]  Twice a day.
[43:28.610 --> 43:30.910]  That's a big plant in a small pot.
[43:30.910 --> 43:36.270]  That means you really benefit from having some kind of automated system or a bigger
[43:36.270 --> 43:37.270]  container.
[43:37.270 --> 43:43.270]  Lots of people go to quite a large container, so they only have to water once a day.
[43:43.270 --> 43:46.030]  But it really depends on how big the plant is.
[43:46.030 --> 43:50.190]  Then you get to develop the skill of lifting the pot.
[43:50.190 --> 43:51.850]  This pot feels heavy.
[43:51.850 --> 43:53.510]  That means it's full of water.
[43:53.510 --> 43:56.150]  When it runs out of water, it'll feel light.
[43:56.150 --> 43:57.470]  That's a tremendous skill.
[43:57.470 --> 44:02.750]  Keep lifting your pots and gauge how much water is in them.
[44:02.750 --> 44:06.030]  There's many products you can poke in here to get water.
[44:06.030 --> 44:11.070]  In my experience, it all comes back to calibrating yourself.
[44:11.070 --> 44:14.630]  You can do much better by lifting the pot.
[44:14.630 --> 44:22.350]  We've covered all of these cardinal parameters for plants.
[44:22.350 --> 44:26.310]  Nutrients and media are big, and light is big.
[44:26.310 --> 44:28.270]  You want to get these correct.
[44:28.270 --> 44:32.610]  You want to make sure you want to do temperature and humidity in your box.
[44:32.610 --> 44:37.750]  If you have plenty of wind, you're going to be fine with ambient CO2.
[44:37.750 --> 44:39.790]  I want to conclude on one thing.
[44:39.790 --> 44:45.970]  Lots of cannabis gets yellow leaves, purple leaves, discolored leaves, burned leaf edges.
[44:45.970 --> 44:52.910]  In our research here, most of the time, that's from too much fertilizer.
[44:52.910 --> 44:55.450]  People panic and they think they don't have enough.
[44:55.590 --> 45:01.290]  It's often from too much, which is why that EC meter is so important.
[45:01.290 --> 45:08.370]  Why flushing it like this keeps it from being either deficient or toxic because you're flushing
[45:08.370 --> 45:12.710]  the pot a little bit each time you water.
[45:12.710 --> 45:15.930]  If you get these parameters right, your plants look just like that.
[45:15.930 --> 45:20.770]  They'll be healthy, green, and at high light.
[45:20.770 --> 45:24.570]  You can push them hard and get high growth.
[45:24.690 --> 45:26.090]  Thanks for listening.
[45:26.090 --> 45:29.690]  We'll join you again on another video.
[45:29.690 --> 45:33.050]  Two more things.
[45:33.050 --> 45:37.490]  We already got two questions from the audience that I want to make really clear in this.
[45:37.490 --> 45:42.410]  Number one, water with nutrient solution every time you water.
[45:42.410 --> 45:44.090]  Don't give them tap water.
[45:44.090 --> 45:45.790]  It's very dilute.
[45:45.790 --> 45:48.370]  It's made to be watered every single time.
[45:48.370 --> 45:53.090]  No matter if you water once every three days, three times a day, always water with nutrient
[45:53.090 --> 45:54.090]  solution.
[45:54.610 --> 45:55.610]  That's thing one.
[45:55.610 --> 45:58.050]  Thing two, color of light.
[45:58.050 --> 46:03.610]  This is a huge question and many people have strong opinions about colors of light.
[46:03.610 --> 46:06.730]  We've done a lot of studies on this.
[46:06.730 --> 46:10.290]  Here's what it comes down to for homeowners.
[46:10.290 --> 46:17.970]  White, W-H-I-T-E, white light.
[46:17.970 --> 46:23.890]  The reason I recommend that is you can see the plants.
[46:24.690 --> 46:28.170]  You could diagnose subtle differences in color of the plants.
[46:28.170 --> 46:33.050]  You can diagnose tiny insects in the plants.
[46:33.050 --> 46:34.430]  It's aesthetically pleasing.
[46:34.430 --> 46:35.690]  You want to look at the plants.
[46:35.690 --> 46:39.930]  There's this old Chinese saying, the best fertilizer is the footsteps of the farmer.
[46:39.930 --> 46:43.330]  Well, if the plants are in white light, you're going to want to look at them and you're going
[46:43.330 --> 46:45.210]  to tell.
[46:45.210 --> 46:50.970]  Purple lights are slightly more efficient, but white lights have come a long ways.
[46:50.970 --> 46:53.130]  Now they can be white plus red.
[46:53.370 --> 46:57.370]  That's good, but something that makes the plants look green.
[46:57.370 --> 46:58.370]  That's the key.
[46:58.370 --> 46:59.370]  Thanks.
