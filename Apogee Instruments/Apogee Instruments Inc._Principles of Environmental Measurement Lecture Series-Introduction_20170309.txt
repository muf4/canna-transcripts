[00:01.400 --> 00:28.160]  Hi, I'm Beng O'Malley. I'm an application scientist at ICT International. I'm excited
[00:28.160 --> 00:34.800]  to meet Professor Bruce Bugbee and Chief Scientist Mark Blomquist. We've been using Apogee instruments
[00:34.800 --> 00:39.280]  for a long time now. Being able to meet them and learn more about their instrument is really
[00:39.280 --> 00:46.500]  exciting.
[00:46.500 --> 00:53.000]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, Professor of Crop Physiology at Utah State University and President of
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.040]  Apogee Instruments. We're here at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney
[01:00.040 --> 01:07.520]  University to do an all-day workshop on principles of environmental measurements. We've done
[01:07.520 --> 01:14.320]  some workshops together before, but this is the first in Australia. We're thrilled to
[01:14.320 --> 01:19.480]  be here. This country is coming into spring. As part of that, we want to talk about a couple
[01:19.480 --> 01:25.560]  instruments that we have been working on for several years. We're introducing these
[01:25.560 --> 01:33.520]  instruments in this workshop. One of them is a spectroradiometer. It's small, compact,
[01:33.520 --> 01:40.800]  rugged. It's made for continuous monitoring outside. Like any spectroradiometer, it can
[01:40.800 --> 01:47.560]  be mounted this way and a second one can be mounted up and down. So you get reflectance
[01:47.560 --> 01:54.560]  signatures from plant canopies. This is small and lightweight. It can be flown on a drone.
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.600]  We've been working on this for several years and we're excited to be introducing it at
[02:00.600 --> 02:07.960]  this workshop. Tomorrow, the videos will show in detail the characteristics of this sensor
[02:07.960 --> 02:10.960]  and what it can do in applications.
[02:10.960 --> 02:22.600]  I'm holding a net radiometer. Like the spectroradiometer, we've been developing this one for quite some
[02:22.600 --> 02:29.040]  time. The design goals when we started were to build a small, compact, lightweight instrument
[02:29.040 --> 02:33.840]  to facilitate mounting. At the same time, we wanted to build a four-component instrument
[02:33.840 --> 02:41.520]  that was lower cost but still performed with regards to accuracy, compared well and favorably
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.200]  to the four-component instruments already on the market. A couple of the design features
[02:47.200 --> 02:53.120]  is all of the signals come into a central analog-to-digital converter. Then all of the
[02:53.120 --> 02:59.920]  signals are output as SDI-12 so it doesn't use a number of data logger channels in order
[02:59.920 --> 03:07.320]  to make the measurement. Also, each individual sensor has a heater to try to keep dew and
[03:07.320 --> 03:14.600]  frost off of the detectors and facilitate accurate measurements in all conditions. Like
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.960]  Bruce said, we're happy to be here in Australia to teach the workshop and discuss these new
[03:20.960 --> 03:23.720]  instruments as part of our time.
[03:24.720 --> 03:32.720]  Quite a few of the participants in this workshop are PhD candidates. So this is a workshop
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.720]  for scientists looking for new technologies in emerging instrumentation.
[03:39.720 --> 03:49.490]  My name is Dr. Peter Cole. I'm the director of ICT International. We're proud to be the
[03:49.490 --> 03:55.210]  distributors of Apogee instruments in Australia. In regard to the principles of environmental
[03:55.210 --> 04:00.610]  measurement, this is truly exciting because these principles are really very important
[04:00.610 --> 04:06.050]  things to understand because they enable you to deploy the instruments in the right way,
[04:06.050 --> 04:11.770]  collect the right data and provide the correct data interpretation. And this is really very
[04:11.770 --> 04:12.770]  important.
