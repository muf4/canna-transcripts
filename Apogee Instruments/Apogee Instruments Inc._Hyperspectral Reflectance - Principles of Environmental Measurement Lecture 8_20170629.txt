[00:01.660 --> 00:23.020]  Bruce kind of introduced my topic at the
[00:23.020 --> 00:25.060]  end of his last presentation. I'm going to
[00:25.060 --> 00:27.020]  talk a bit about spectral reflectance.
[00:27.020 --> 00:30.620]  I put all of these pictures and the
[00:30.620 --> 00:33.940]  different scales on my introductory
[00:33.940 --> 00:36.940]  slide because there's lots of different
[00:36.940 --> 00:38.780]  scales that you can consider when
[00:38.780 --> 00:41.060]  measuring reflectance everywhere from a
[00:41.060 --> 00:43.460]  single leaf measurement all the way up
[00:43.460 --> 00:46.220]  to satellite measurements of the Earth
[00:46.220 --> 00:49.420]  surface. I think mostly what I'm going
[00:49.420 --> 00:51.220]  to talk about is more reflectance
[00:51.220 --> 00:54.900]  principles but we'll be down and more of
[00:54.900 --> 00:59.260]  this range of scale but some of or most
[00:59.260 --> 01:01.980]  of what I will say will apply to all of
[01:01.980 --> 01:04.780]  the scales. Again if you have any
[01:04.780 --> 01:08.460]  questions feel free to ask while I'm
[01:08.460 --> 01:12.540]  going through the slides. Reflectance is
[01:12.540 --> 01:15.900]  a pretty simple concept. We just divide
[01:15.900 --> 01:19.800]  the reflected radiation so everything
[01:19.800 --> 01:22.140]  that's bouncing off the surface and
[01:22.140 --> 01:25.500]  coming back by the radiation that's
[01:25.500 --> 01:28.700]  incident on the surface. It's
[01:28.700 --> 01:32.220]  powerful, simple but powerful because we
[01:32.220 --> 01:35.180]  can learn a lot about surface properties,
[01:35.180 --> 01:38.580]  surface conditions based on how the
[01:38.580 --> 01:42.420]  reflectance signal changes. We've already
[01:42.420 --> 01:44.860]  seen this plot more than one time today
[01:44.860 --> 01:46.780]  so I won't spend too much time on it
[01:46.780 --> 01:48.860]  but it shows the shortwave radiation
[01:48.860 --> 01:54.540]  spectrum at Earth's surface. In most
[01:54.540 --> 01:57.580]  applications, not all because we can do
[01:57.580 --> 01:59.380]  this in the laboratory and we can also
[01:59.380 --> 02:02.500]  do it on small leaf samples where we
[02:02.500 --> 02:05.140]  often use artificial lights, but we're
[02:05.140 --> 02:07.380]  talking about the scales of plant
[02:07.380 --> 02:10.260]  canopies and flux towers things like
[02:10.260 --> 02:13.140]  that. Typically the light
[02:13.140 --> 02:17.100]  source is the Sun and so incident
[02:17.100 --> 02:20.660]  radiation is these data that you see
[02:20.660 --> 02:23.140]  right here. Then we have to invert our
[02:23.140 --> 02:25.620]  sensor and measure the reflected signal
[02:25.620 --> 02:28.060]  and that goes in the numerator of our
[02:28.060 --> 02:32.980]  equation. When we do that it looks like
[02:32.980 --> 02:36.340]  this for some surfaces that we're all
[02:36.340 --> 02:39.980]  familiar with. I have water, soil, a plant
[02:40.020 --> 02:45.940]  canopy, and snow. You can see one thing
[02:45.940 --> 02:47.620]  that sticks out immediately from this
[02:47.620 --> 02:51.980]  slide is we can use reflectance to
[02:51.980 --> 02:55.700]  characterize what it is at the surface. I
[02:55.700 --> 02:57.820]  don't know that that's necessarily a
[02:57.820 --> 03:00.100]  major application because there's other
[03:00.100 --> 03:02.140]  ways of characterizing what's going on
[03:02.140 --> 03:05.340]  at the surface, but the reflectance
[03:05.340 --> 03:08.900]  signatures are very very different when
[03:08.900 --> 03:16.040]  we move from one surface to the next.
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.440]  This gives you an idea of how much it
[03:18.440 --> 03:21.080]  costs to measure the different wavelength
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.200]  ranges. To get the visible spectrum
[03:25.200 --> 03:26.360]  and a little bit of the near-infrared
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.800]  maybe 350 or 400 nanometers up to about
[03:30.800 --> 03:35.000]  a thousand nanometers or so is a
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.920]  reasonable price tag. Then to get that
[03:38.920 --> 03:41.320]  same wavelength range plus more of the
[03:41.320 --> 03:43.080]  near-infrared, now we're talking about
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.360]  maybe half of the solar spectrum, we're
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.080]  getting a bigger price tag. To get
[03:51.080 --> 03:53.080]  the whole spectrum we're talking about a
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.240]  lot more money. The price scales
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.200]  with the amount of information that
[03:59.200 --> 04:03.480]  you're measuring. I'm mostly going to
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.360]  talk about this range of 350 or 400 up
[04:08.360 --> 04:11.960]  into the a thousand range, largely
[04:11.960 --> 04:16.120]  because that's the more affordable range
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.640]  and that's the type of instruments that
[04:17.640 --> 04:20.880]  we typically deal with, at least at
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.480]  Apogee instruments. I want to focus on
[04:26.480 --> 04:28.800]  the reflectance spectrum for a plant
[04:28.800 --> 04:30.600]  canopy for a minute. You can see there are
[04:30.600 --> 04:35.000]  a lot of unique features here. One that
[04:35.000 --> 04:36.920]  we already talked about earlier is the
[04:36.960 --> 04:39.280]  photosynthetically active radiation
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.280]  range which is 400 to 700 nanometers. The
[04:43.280 --> 04:45.920]  reason that it's so much lower than a
[04:45.920 --> 04:48.600]  lot of the other parts of the reflectance
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.440]  spectrum is because green leaves have a
[04:51.440 --> 04:53.680]  lot of chlorophyll in them and the
[04:53.680 --> 04:55.360]  chlorophyll is absorbing all of the
[04:55.360 --> 04:57.880]  photosynthetic photons for photosynthesis.
[04:57.880 --> 05:00.920]  This whole portion of the spectrum
[05:00.920 --> 05:03.960]  is depressed small values because all
[05:03.960 --> 05:05.760]  those photons are being absorbed for
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.400]  photosynthesis. Within that range we
[05:10.400 --> 05:12.080]  have this little green peak. We're all
[05:12.080 --> 05:13.920]  familiar with it, we can see it, that's
[05:13.920 --> 05:17.280]  why plants are green. There's the red
[05:17.280 --> 05:19.560]  edge, so the point where we transition
[05:19.560 --> 05:21.400]  from the photosynthetically active range
[05:21.400 --> 05:24.840]  to the near infrared range. It jumps up
[05:24.840 --> 05:26.640]  here because everything beyond about
[05:26.640 --> 05:29.520]  700 are non photosynthetic photons. A
[05:29.520 --> 05:31.720]  high percentage of them are being
[05:31.720 --> 05:34.760]  reflected. Then all these dips here
[05:34.760 --> 05:40.840]  are water absorption bands. Healthy
[05:40.840 --> 05:42.680]  plant leaves tend to have a lot of water
[05:42.680 --> 05:44.840]  in them and once you get out into the
[05:44.840 --> 05:47.360]  near infrared range water is a pretty
[05:47.360 --> 05:49.520]  good absorber of certain wavelengths.
[05:49.520 --> 05:54.160]  There's a water band about 970 or 980,
[05:54.160 --> 05:58.960]  another one around 11 to 1200, another
[05:58.960 --> 06:01.120]  one about 1400, and then another one
[06:01.120 --> 06:04.960]  about 1900 nanometers. We can learn
[06:04.960 --> 06:07.600]  something about potentially about
[06:07.600 --> 06:11.920]  photosynthesis, about water, different
[06:11.920 --> 06:16.000]  variables based on measurements of plant
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.250]  reflectance. This slide illustrates how
[06:22.250 --> 06:25.210]  you would do it for a single leaf.
[06:25.210 --> 06:28.850]  Typically this is done in the
[06:28.850 --> 06:31.610]  laboratory and it requires an artificial
[06:31.610 --> 06:35.290]  light source. Here's a fiber optic cable
[06:35.290 --> 06:39.530]  that's going to absorb the light, take it
[06:39.530 --> 06:42.010]  back to a spectroradiometer which
[06:42.010 --> 06:44.530]  actually makes the measurement. When we
[06:44.530 --> 06:46.450]  start we have to have a reflectance
[06:46.450 --> 06:50.210]  spectrum, a reference reflectance spectrum.
[06:50.210 --> 06:54.490]  We use a small highly reflective white
[06:54.490 --> 06:57.970]  surface to give us a reference spectrum.
[06:57.970 --> 07:00.770]  Essentially this would represent the
[07:00.930 --> 07:03.650]  denominator in the equation when we
[07:03.650 --> 07:06.170]  make this measurement. This would
[07:06.170 --> 07:08.290]  represent all of the incident radiation
[07:08.290 --> 07:11.010]  assuming our reflectance panel has a
[07:11.010 --> 07:14.050]  high reflectivity something near 100%.
[07:14.050 --> 07:19.170]  Then after we make our
[07:19.170 --> 07:21.490]  measurement on a reflectance panel, and
[07:21.490 --> 07:23.730]  often this is made out of spectral on or
[07:23.730 --> 07:27.490]  PTFE, some material that has really high
[07:27.490 --> 07:31.490]  reflectivity near 100%. Once we get our
[07:31.490 --> 07:34.090]  reference measurement, the denominator of
[07:34.090 --> 07:37.890]  the reflectance equation, then we can put
[07:37.890 --> 07:41.890]  the sample under the light source and
[07:41.890 --> 07:43.410]  measure the reflectance from the sample.
[07:43.410 --> 07:46.090]  You'll notice we have to have some kind
[07:46.090 --> 07:49.450]  of flat black background behind the
[07:49.450 --> 07:53.250]  sample. Bruce talked a little bit ago
[07:53.250 --> 07:55.650]  about how reflectance and transmission
[07:55.690 --> 07:57.610]  spectra look very similar. They are kind
[07:57.610 --> 08:00.450]  of analogs of each other. If you have
[08:00.450 --> 08:02.530]  some photons that are being transmitted
[08:02.530 --> 08:05.090]  through the leaf and you have a highly
[08:05.090 --> 08:06.930]  reflective background like if we put
[08:06.930 --> 08:08.770]  the leaf over top of our reflectance
[08:08.770 --> 08:12.130]  panel, some of those transmitted photons
[08:12.130 --> 08:14.010]  would reflect off the white background,
[08:14.010 --> 08:16.490]  be transmitted back through the leaf, and
[08:16.490 --> 08:19.210]  actually get measured as reflected
[08:19.210 --> 08:22.290]  photons rather than photons that were
[08:22.290 --> 08:23.650]  transmitted all the way through the
[08:23.650 --> 08:26.370]  leaf, reflected off the back, and then
[08:26.370 --> 08:28.690]  transmitted back through the leaf.
[08:28.690 --> 08:31.690]  When you measure your sample you put
[08:31.690 --> 08:34.650]  it on top of some kind of flat black
[08:34.650 --> 08:36.570]  background that has a very low
[08:36.570 --> 08:39.370]  reflectivity so we can assume that all
[08:39.370 --> 08:41.770]  the reflection comes from the sample
[08:41.770 --> 08:45.770]  itself, in this case a leaf. This
[08:45.770 --> 08:48.010]  measurement, as I mentioned, represents
[08:48.010 --> 08:50.690]  the denominator of our equation. This
[08:50.690 --> 08:52.530]  measurement over here represents the
[08:52.610 --> 08:55.650]  numerator of the equation. This is how
[08:55.650 --> 08:58.490]  you would make a laboratory measurement
[08:58.490 --> 09:01.290]  of a single leaf sample. When we move to
[09:01.290 --> 09:04.770]  the field to do it for a plant canopy,
[09:04.770 --> 09:09.170]  for example, the actual method isn't
[09:09.170 --> 09:11.130]  that much different and I'll explain it
[09:11.130 --> 09:15.770]  when we get there. Just to give you an
[09:15.770 --> 09:18.530]  idea of the kind of information that
[09:18.530 --> 09:21.930]  leaf reflectance might indicate, we have
[09:22.050 --> 09:25.690]  two reflectance spectra here. One where
[09:25.690 --> 09:28.610]  the peak in the green and then some of
[09:28.610 --> 09:30.850]  this radiation in the red is more
[09:30.850 --> 09:33.410]  reflected than the other. The reflectance
[09:33.410 --> 09:37.050]  is higher I should say. This would
[09:37.050 --> 09:40.450]  represent a well fertilized leaf, a high
[09:40.450 --> 09:43.090]  nitrogen content. This one would
[09:43.090 --> 09:45.970]  represent potential of nitrogen deficit.
[09:45.970 --> 09:49.210]  You get changes in the spectrum as a
[09:49.210 --> 09:51.210]  function of properties of the leaf.
[09:51.290 --> 09:54.450]  Here it's related to nitrogen but there
[09:54.450 --> 09:59.010]  could be other properties that we
[09:59.010 --> 10:02.370]  can measure by analyzing the
[10:02.370 --> 10:09.760]  changes in the reflectance spectrum.
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.000]  When we move to the field the reflectance
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.880]  for a plant canopy looks similar to the
[10:15.880 --> 10:18.120]  reflectance of a single leaf. The
[10:18.120 --> 10:20.600]  previous data were for a single leaf.
[10:20.600 --> 10:22.720]  This is actually a reflectance spectrum
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.240]  that we measured on a plant canopy.
[10:26.240 --> 10:31.800]  In times past we're interested in very
[10:31.800 --> 10:34.680]  specific portions of the of the spectrum.
[10:34.680 --> 10:37.440]  One that everybody I think is familiar
[10:37.440 --> 10:41.520]  with is the difference between red
[10:41.520 --> 10:44.200]  reflectance and near-infrared reflectance.
[10:44.200 --> 10:48.520]  I highlighted them here. For a long
[10:48.520 --> 10:51.400]  time we've used reflectance measurements
[10:51.440 --> 10:54.280]  of these two wavelengths somewhere in
[10:54.280 --> 10:55.520]  the red and somewhere in the near
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.120]  infrared to quantify NDVI. You've
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.960]  probably heard this acronym before. It's
[11:03.960 --> 11:06.120]  the normalized difference vegetation
[11:06.120 --> 11:08.480]  index where we take near-infrared
[11:08.480 --> 11:10.880]  reflectance minus red reflectance in the
[11:10.880 --> 11:13.280]  numerator and then we take the sum of
[11:13.280 --> 11:17.320]  the two in the denominator. Because we
[11:17.320 --> 11:20.480]  have strong absorption of photons and
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.960]  low reflection in the red and high
[11:22.960 --> 11:24.000]  reflection in the near-infrared
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.960]  essentially NDVI is a greenness index.
[11:26.960 --> 11:30.440]  We can measure it and it tells us about
[11:30.440 --> 11:33.680]  how much leaf area is covering the
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.840]  surface or how green the surface is.
[11:37.840 --> 11:40.480]  There are small devices, this is an
[11:40.480 --> 11:43.120]  instrument from from decagon devices,
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.040]  that we can use to measure specific
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.440]  indices like NDVI. This small sensor
[11:51.440 --> 11:52.840]  that I've shown here is essentially a
[11:52.840 --> 11:56.200]  two channel or a two band radiometer. It
[11:56.200 --> 11:59.120]  has one sensor in it that measures the
[11:59.120 --> 12:02.360]  red range and another sensor in it that
[12:02.360 --> 12:05.600]  measures the near-infrared range. It
[12:05.600 --> 12:08.080]  makes those measurements, does this
[12:08.080 --> 12:11.360]  calculation internally and outputs an
[12:11.360 --> 12:14.480]  NDVI value. If we're only interested
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.440]  in specific indices like NDVI
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.280]  then small low-cost radiometers like
[12:23.280 --> 12:25.880]  this can be very useful. I showed some
[12:25.880 --> 12:28.040]  prices earlier of spectroradiometers
[12:28.040 --> 12:31.520]  and you know 3000 to 6000 was a rough
[12:31.520 --> 12:33.760]  estimate of an instrument that would
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.160]  give you this reflectance spectrum. This
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.880]  two channel radiometer is about an order
[12:40.880 --> 12:42.560]  of magnitude lower this would be maybe
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.520]  a $300 instrument somewhere in in that
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.840]  ballpark. Red and near-infrared
[12:50.840 --> 12:53.360]  reflectance aren't the only wavelengths
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.320]  of interest. The red edge can be very
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.200]  informative, often we're interested in
[12:59.200 --> 13:02.400]  blue reflectance. There's a another
[13:02.400 --> 13:05.400]  index kind of like NDVI, the
[13:05.400 --> 13:07.560]  mathematical form is exactly the same
[13:07.560 --> 13:09.760]  you'll see in just a second that uses
[13:09.760 --> 13:13.560]  reflectance at 531 nanometers, a green
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.280]  wavelength, and reflectance at 570
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.720]  nanometers, kind of a yellow wavelength.
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.360]  It's called PRI, this means photochemical
[13:25.360 --> 13:28.880]  reflectance index. We take the
[13:28.880 --> 13:31.640]  reflectance at 570 and minus the
[13:31.640 --> 13:34.520]  reflectance at 531 and divide that by
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.120]  the sum of the two and we get this PRI
[13:38.200 --> 13:42.620]  and it's still being studied. There's a
[13:42.620 --> 13:46.240]  lot of work going on to better understand
[13:46.240 --> 13:49.040]  what PRI is actually measuring but it
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.200]  seems to be closely related to light use
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.800]  efficiency of plants. So PRI and NDVI
[13:57.800 --> 14:00.720]  we can measure again with these
[14:00.720 --> 14:03.680]  small low-cost devices like this and I
[14:03.680 --> 14:06.160]  will say that Decagon also has a PRI
[14:06.200 --> 14:08.400]  instrument in addition to the NDVI
[14:08.400 --> 14:11.200]  instrument. There turns out there
[14:11.200 --> 14:14.680]  are a whole host of fairly simple
[14:14.680 --> 14:17.000]  reflectance indices that have been
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.360]  published in the literature. Here's a
[14:19.360 --> 14:21.920]  relatively recent review paper, this is
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.960]  actually a table from that paper, where
[14:25.960 --> 14:29.360]  20 different, I think there's 20 of them
[14:29.360 --> 14:32.640]  on there, relatively simple reflectance
[14:32.640 --> 14:34.880]  indices are shown here that are all
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.800]  attempting to quantify different things.
[14:37.800 --> 14:40.840]  We've got chlorophyll content,
[14:40.840 --> 14:44.720]  photosynthetic activity, liquid water
[14:44.720 --> 14:47.400]  content, carotenoids and xanthophyll
[14:47.400 --> 14:51.360]  cycle, anthocyanin, canopy water content.
[14:51.360 --> 14:53.640]  There's lots of different plant
[14:53.640 --> 14:55.600]  properties that people have attempted to
[14:55.600 --> 15:01.600]  estimate using reflectance indices or
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.800]  learn about using reflectance indices.
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.160]  I actually got a list from a colleague
[15:07.160 --> 15:10.920]  one time, it's unpublished but the list
[15:10.920 --> 15:13.280]  that she had compiled had 62 different
[15:13.280 --> 15:16.760]  reflectance indices in it. There's a
[15:16.760 --> 15:19.520]  lot of these things out there. I guess
[15:19.520 --> 15:21.000]  the point that I want to make is if
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.240]  again if you're interested in one
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.080]  index like just NDVI or just PRI, these
[15:29.080 --> 15:31.960]  relatively simple two band and sometimes
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.120]  I've seen three or four band radiometers
[15:34.120 --> 15:36.840]  are available to give you information on
[15:36.840 --> 15:39.680]  a single index. It makes sense that
[15:39.680 --> 15:43.760]  why not use the the whole spectrum if we
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.080]  can rather than trying to just build
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.200]  sensors for specific indexes only.
[15:51.200 --> 15:53.200]  That's what a spectroradiometer gives
[15:53.200 --> 15:56.320]  you is the measurement of the entire
[15:56.320 --> 16:00.400]  spectrum. One of the reasons I think
[16:00.440 --> 16:03.240]  that maybe this hasn't been more widely
[16:03.240 --> 16:10.360]  used or is maybe just starting to be to
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.640]  be more and more applied in in research
[16:12.640 --> 16:14.880]  and especially in commercial operations
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.000]  is in the past spectroradiometers tended
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.040]  to be expensive. Oftentimes they're large
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.880]  and heavy and they require
[16:25.880 --> 16:27.880]  operator or computer and so they're not
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.200]  necessarily easy instruments to take
[16:32.200 --> 16:34.960]  from the laboratory and use routinely
[16:34.960 --> 16:37.280]  in the field. It can be a little bit
[16:37.280 --> 16:40.200]  challenging so hence there is a lot of
[16:40.200 --> 16:43.960]  use of these small narrowband single or
[16:43.960 --> 16:46.760]  dual or three channel radiometers.
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.840]  The Apogee spectroradiometer we
[16:51.840 --> 16:54.280]  tried to design it to overcome some of
[16:54.280 --> 16:56.600]  these challenges and limitations.
[16:56.600 --> 17:00.760]  Make it more of a field instrument
[17:00.760 --> 17:03.520]  in addition to a lab instrument if you
[17:03.520 --> 17:07.400]  wanted to use it in the laboratory. Some
[17:07.400 --> 17:10.800]  of the the features are highlighted here
[17:10.800 --> 17:12.360]  but really we wanted to try to make
[17:12.360 --> 17:18.120]  something low-cost, small, lightweight and
[17:18.120 --> 17:21.200]  there it is compared to a couple quantum
[17:21.200 --> 17:23.160]  sensors just so you can get an idea of
[17:23.200 --> 17:29.250]  the size. Some applications and I
[17:29.250 --> 17:32.090]  won't go into a ton of detail here but
[17:32.090 --> 17:33.770]  this is the kind of thing that you could
[17:33.770 --> 17:36.930]  do with a unit like this. Continuous
[17:36.930 --> 17:39.250]  automated measurement of plant canopies.
[17:39.250 --> 17:43.810]  Often we're interested in plant response
[17:43.810 --> 17:46.010]  to environmental change and this might
[17:46.010 --> 17:48.490]  be one way to quantify that measuring
[17:48.490 --> 17:51.730]  reflectance spectra. Another potential
[17:51.730 --> 17:54.250]  application is precision agriculture.
[17:54.810 --> 17:57.170]  Rapid field phenotyping of crop
[17:57.170 --> 17:59.530]  plants looking for differences in
[17:59.530 --> 18:03.730]  genetic lines, differences in different
[18:03.730 --> 18:07.770]  treatments. We can mount them on mobile
[18:07.770 --> 18:09.890]  instruments and collect high-frequency
[18:09.890 --> 18:18.810]  data for precision ag. I said a few
[18:18.810 --> 18:20.370]  minutes ago when I was explaining how to
[18:20.370 --> 18:22.050]  make the reflectance measurement in the
[18:22.050 --> 18:25.610]  lab that the procedure was relatively
[18:25.610 --> 18:27.690]  similar for making measurements in the
[18:27.690 --> 18:30.210]  field. There's a couple of different
[18:30.210 --> 18:32.770]  approaches that you can take. One would
[18:32.770 --> 18:36.210]  be to mount one instrument level and
[18:36.210 --> 18:38.610]  looking up and another instrument
[18:38.610 --> 18:42.450]  pointing down at the plant canopies.
[18:42.450 --> 18:44.850]  This gives you the reflected spectrum,
[18:44.850 --> 18:47.770]  this gives you the incoming spectrum, the
[18:47.770 --> 18:50.610]  ratio of the two is a reflectance
[18:50.650 --> 18:55.130]  measurement. Using an approach like
[18:55.130 --> 18:56.970]  this you actually have to match the
[18:56.970 --> 18:59.570]  spectroradiometer. In essence it's a
[18:59.570 --> 19:02.610]  field calibration. We want we want the
[19:02.610 --> 19:06.610]  data for this one to match this one when
[19:06.610 --> 19:11.050]  we have a hundred percent reflectance.
[19:11.050 --> 19:14.770]  What that means is you have to use a
[19:14.770 --> 19:17.410]  reflectance panel which is a diffused
[19:17.410 --> 19:19.730]  reflector with reflectance near a hundred
[19:19.850 --> 19:22.810]  percent to match the spectroradiometer.
[19:22.810 --> 19:26.810]  Before you start it essentially means
[19:26.810 --> 19:30.770]  you have to put your reference panel,
[19:30.770 --> 19:33.930]  your reflectance panel underneath the
[19:33.930 --> 19:36.130]  downward looking instrument and then
[19:36.130 --> 19:39.610]  calibrate this one to match the output
[19:39.610 --> 19:42.170]  from that one. Then when you remove
[19:42.170 --> 19:44.970]  the reflectance panel you can take the
[19:44.970 --> 19:46.730]  ratio directly and it will be a
[19:46.930 --> 19:50.970]  measurement of reflectance. There is
[19:50.970 --> 19:57.090]  some requirements of users being in
[19:57.090 --> 19:59.090]  the field to make the system work
[19:59.090 --> 20:01.490]  before you start. We have to match the
[20:01.490 --> 20:04.690]  spectroradiometers. Another option is you
[20:04.690 --> 20:07.290]  could make measurements with
[20:07.290 --> 20:09.610]  the single downward looking instrument.
[20:09.610 --> 20:12.810]  If we take this one away we can make
[20:12.810 --> 20:16.410]  measurements with this one by saving the
[20:16.410 --> 20:18.250]  measurement when we've got a reflectance
[20:18.250 --> 20:20.890]  panel here. This becomes the denominator
[20:20.890 --> 20:22.810]  in our equation and then when we remove
[20:22.810 --> 20:25.090]  the reflectance panel subsequent
[20:25.090 --> 20:27.170]  measurements become the numerator in
[20:27.170 --> 20:28.810]  the equation. We just take the ratio of
[20:28.810 --> 20:31.290]  the two. The challenge with doing it this
[20:31.290 --> 20:33.530]  way is every time the sky conditions
[20:33.530 --> 20:36.410]  change we have to make a new measurement
[20:36.410 --> 20:39.090]  of the the background radiation with the
[20:39.090 --> 20:42.810]  reflectance panel because if the sky
[20:42.810 --> 20:44.370]  conditions change that means the
[20:44.370 --> 20:46.050]  denominator and the reflectance equation
[20:46.410 --> 20:48.450]  changed and we have to account for that.
[20:48.450 --> 20:51.090]  There's multiple ways to do it using
[20:51.090 --> 20:54.210]  two instruments like this would be the
[20:54.210 --> 20:57.890]  way to do it for long-term unattended
[20:57.890 --> 21:00.090]  measurements. If you only had a single
[21:00.090 --> 21:01.890]  measurement that'd be the way to do it
[21:01.890 --> 21:05.650]  if it's more of an on-the-fly mobile
[21:05.650 --> 21:07.930]  measurement where it's convenient to
[21:07.930 --> 21:12.130]  make the reflectance measurement, the
[21:12.130 --> 21:14.050]  background measurement periodically as
[21:14.050 --> 21:17.690]  the sky conditions change. We actually
[21:17.690 --> 21:21.850]  made some measurements. We're
[21:21.850 --> 21:24.930]  still in the process of beta testing
[21:24.930 --> 21:28.610]  and this instrument. We actually made
[21:28.610 --> 21:30.170]  some measurements in the backyard of our
[21:30.170 --> 21:32.210]  facility at Apogee Instruments in Logan,
[21:32.210 --> 21:36.290]  Utah just over a turf grass surface.
[21:36.290 --> 21:38.090]  Our configuration essentially looks like
[21:38.090 --> 21:41.130]  this. We have an upward facing instrument
[21:41.130 --> 21:44.330]  and a downward facing instrument. We use
[21:44.330 --> 21:47.570]  a spectral on panel to match the
[21:47.570 --> 21:50.010]  downward instrument to the upward
[21:50.010 --> 21:53.730]  instrument. This gives you some
[21:53.730 --> 21:56.890]  sample data. As I mentioned this was over
[21:56.890 --> 22:00.530]  turf grass. To make it a bit more
[22:00.530 --> 22:04.210]  interesting we intentionally stopped
[22:04.210 --> 22:07.730]  irrigating the turf grass. This is
[22:07.730 --> 22:10.970]  the reflectance measurement on the last
[22:11.050 --> 22:13.930]  day that the irrigation system was on.
[22:13.930 --> 22:18.170]  Then we turned off the water about
[22:18.170 --> 22:21.010]  three days later on August 24th the
[22:21.010 --> 22:25.090]  reflectance spectrum was here. Five days
[22:25.090 --> 22:28.610]  later on August 29th it was here and
[22:28.610 --> 22:32.690]  then four days later on September 2nd
[22:32.690 --> 22:36.010]  it was here. You can see there's
[22:36.010 --> 22:38.330]  some pretty substantial changes in the
[22:38.330 --> 22:41.290]  reflectance spectrum as the grass dries
[22:41.290 --> 22:44.330]  out going from well watered to water
[22:44.330 --> 22:48.130]  stressed. This is the kind of the kind of
[22:48.130 --> 22:53.370]  data that spectroradiometers yield.
[22:53.370 --> 22:58.370]  The changes in plant responses to
[22:58.370 --> 23:05.470]  environmental change. We could
[23:05.470 --> 23:09.310]  potentially learn a lot about plants
[23:09.310 --> 23:12.070]  without having to sample them and
[23:12.070 --> 23:13.870]  take them back to the lab for analysis
[23:13.870 --> 23:16.270]  because now we have a way to measure
[23:16.270 --> 23:18.910]  the light reflectance as a function of
[23:18.910 --> 23:21.630]  changes in the environment.
