[00:00.190 --> 00:05.350]  I'm Bruce Bugbee, president of Apogee Instruments, and this is part of an
[00:05.350 --> 00:09.270]  ongoing series of principles of environmental measurement. Today we're
[00:09.270 --> 00:13.790]  going to talk about measuring light for plant growth in just a short talk, and in
[00:13.790 --> 00:19.030]  particular in this talk we're going to focus on measurements of light for
[00:19.030 --> 00:25.350]  humans or for people and measurement of light for plants. Now meters to measure
[00:25.350 --> 00:31.110]  light for plants are more expensive than meters to measure light for people, so
[00:31.110 --> 00:37.430]  people often buy the lower cost meters to measure light for people and then use
[00:37.430 --> 00:43.710]  them to measure light for plants. This can result in significant errors if you
[00:43.710 --> 00:47.390]  don't understand the principles and we're going to go through these. Here's
[00:47.390 --> 00:52.110]  an example. This is a meter to measure light for people. Foot candle meter reads
[00:52.110 --> 00:58.190]  out in foot candles. Here's an Apogee meter. Looks similar to measure light for
[00:58.190 --> 01:02.390]  plants and then of course you can buy these with separate sensors. There's a lot
[01:02.390 --> 01:09.270]  of variations, but we're going to focus on the key differences in these. There's a
[01:09.270 --> 01:16.030]  lot of terms for this, but let's go right to the next slide. First,
[01:16.030 --> 01:28.790]  I'm going to draw a line and we're going to put 400 and 700 nanometers on this line. In between this
[01:28.790 --> 01:35.910]  region are all the colors of light. We go from over here is UV and then we go to
[01:35.910 --> 01:52.790]  blue, green, GRN, red, and then right after this is infrared and we can't see infrared and
[01:52.790 --> 01:58.470]  plants can't see it. So both plants and people see blue, green, and red light.
[01:58.470 --> 02:05.950]  Here's the difference. If we draw a curve of how well we can see the different
[02:05.950 --> 02:20.070]  colors of light, it looks like this. It's a bell-shaped curve like this. We see
[02:20.070 --> 02:27.390]  green light more than ten times better than either blue or red light. Now this
[02:27.550 --> 02:33.990]  is designed with people looking in a box at dim light and it's not
[02:33.990 --> 02:38.590]  intuitive, but green light looks very bright to us and blue and red we have to
[02:38.590 --> 02:44.670]  turn up the intensity so we can see them. So it's a big difference. Now plants see
[02:44.670 --> 02:56.100]  all these colors equally. So here's plants and here's people, humans right
[02:56.100 --> 03:05.180]  here. Now this is lux and foot candles, FC. These are all the same thing for people.
[03:05.180 --> 03:11.660]  Very different shapes of curves. As long as the colors didn't change you could
[03:11.660 --> 03:17.620]  measure one and predict the other from it, but the colors do change when we go
[03:17.620 --> 03:24.380]  from different kinds of light sources. Light for plants is also the same light
[03:24.380 --> 03:29.980]  for any photosynthetic organism. That includes coral in an aquarium. We're not
[03:29.980 --> 03:34.340]  interested in the colors of light that humans see. We are interested in the
[03:34.340 --> 03:43.140]  colors of light that plants see. So as a dramatic demonstration of this we went
[03:43.140 --> 03:48.780]  to my laboratory at Utah State University where we're doing research on
[03:48.780 --> 03:53.740]  multiple colors of light for plant growth and we're going to compare
[03:53.740 --> 04:00.900]  quantum meters that measure light for plants with foot candle meters that
[04:00.900 --> 04:07.540]  measure light for people and see the extent to which we can convert back and
[04:07.540 --> 04:15.340]  forth. So let's take a trip to the lab with this next video and see what this
[04:15.380 --> 04:23.780]  looks like. You can see all the chambers there. These are all
[04:23.780 --> 04:28.420]  chambers that we used for plants in space. There's a picture of an astronaut
[04:28.420 --> 04:31.980]  that's holding the plants. These little chambers are on the space
[04:31.980 --> 04:36.940]  station where we use LEDs. So we want to measure light for plants. Now let's
[04:36.940 --> 04:43.140]  take the first and here's a quantum sensor, an Apogee quantum sensor. This is
[04:43.140 --> 04:48.500]  a research grade foot candle sensor. This is a thousand dollar foot candle
[04:48.500 --> 04:53.140]  sensor to measure light. So we got that with perfect accuracy and excellent
[04:53.140 --> 04:58.300]  accuracy. And then the foot candle meter here. Now let's take a look at what we
[04:58.300 --> 05:04.700]  get in the first chamber with cool white fluorescence. Every chamber is designed
[05:04.700 --> 05:12.500]  to have 200, we can take a stop right there, 200 for quantum flux,
[05:12.740 --> 05:18.260]  photosynthetic radiation, and then this is what the foot candles is. Now that
[05:18.260 --> 05:24.100]  first chamber, this was about 1200 and this is about 200. So this is
[05:24.100 --> 05:28.500]  about six times as much as this. And at the end of this we'll come back to these
[05:28.500 --> 05:33.500]  numbers and compare these ratios. Now let's go to the next chamber. Remember
[05:33.500 --> 05:45.340]  there was a six to one ratio there. Now we close the door. About 200. This is
[05:45.340 --> 05:53.740]  almost an eight times ratio in this chamber. So this has equal light for
[05:53.740 --> 05:57.860]  plants but if you measured it for this you'd be way off. You'd think this one
[05:57.860 --> 06:02.420]  should grow better plants and it does not because the ratio changes. Let's keep
[06:02.420 --> 06:11.140]  going with chambers. Now we'll go from a neutral white LEDs. You can see the color
[06:11.140 --> 06:19.900]  of the warm white LEDs. Close the door. Keep going just a bit. We get there. 200. Now
[06:19.900 --> 06:25.260]  look at this. 1300 here. So yet a different ratio even though the light
[06:25.260 --> 06:31.460]  for the plants is the same. And now let's take one more chamber. Now there was
[06:31.540 --> 06:40.620]  200 and 1300. Now we're going to take this sensor out of this chamber. You can see the
[06:40.620 --> 06:48.140]  ratio of the two there. And now we're going to go to an LED chamber. This is red and
[06:48.140 --> 06:57.380]  blue LEDs. Very commonly used for plants. Now look at the ratio. 200. Whoa! The other ones
[06:57.500 --> 07:07.060]  were 1200 to 1600. This is only 649. A foot candle meter dramatically under measures
[07:07.060 --> 07:11.780]  LED lights and they're blue and red LEDs and that shouldn't be surprising
[07:11.780 --> 07:18.460]  because humans don't see red and blue light very efficiently. What we see is
[07:18.460 --> 07:24.980]  green light. So particularly if there's any LEDs, foot candle meters have huge
[07:25.020 --> 07:31.060]  errors. So this is an example of these measurements very quickly made under
[07:31.060 --> 07:36.820]  different types of lights. Now let's go back to our slide and summarize this
[07:36.820 --> 07:42.500]  data. Now we've watched this video many times to get these numbers. Here's a
[07:42.500 --> 07:53.740]  summary of the data. First, cool white. The PPF was 200. The foot candles was 1728.
[07:53.740 --> 08:03.220]  And the ratio is 6.4. Now this would be okay if it's always a 6.4 ratio. We could
[08:03.220 --> 08:07.660]  just measure this and divide by 6.4 and predict plant growth. Now let's look what
[08:07.660 --> 08:16.900]  happens when we do neutral white. PPF 200. Boom! This jumps way up 7.9x. This
[08:16.900 --> 08:27.700]  difference right here is 23%. So using a foot candle meter just with cool white
[08:27.700 --> 08:34.100]  and neutral light, 23% error. That's pretty significant. Let's keep going. Warm
[08:34.100 --> 08:41.540]  white. That's in between 12, 15, 13. All with the exact same light for plants.
[08:42.100 --> 08:50.940]  Different ratios here. So if 20% accuracy is good enough, you could get away with
[08:50.940 --> 08:56.260]  the foot candle meter. But let's look at LEDs. Remember how low that number was?
[08:56.260 --> 09:05.300]  620. 3.1x. This is off by like a hundred percent compared to these other meters
[09:05.420 --> 09:11.700]  even though this would grow excellent plants. So for any kind of precision work
[09:11.700 --> 09:17.980]  for plants you really need to buy a photosynthetically active radiation
[09:17.980 --> 09:24.540]  meter. They're called quantum meters. They're calibrated and designed to
[09:24.540 --> 09:29.460]  measure light for plants. Think of the investment that people make in growing
[09:29.460 --> 09:35.620]  indoor plants. They spend hundreds of dollars on the lights and without a
[09:35.620 --> 09:39.860]  meter to measure the lights you can't tell if your lights are aging. You can't
[09:39.860 --> 09:43.660]  tell why the plants are growing in one place, better in one place than another.
[09:43.660 --> 09:52.580]  You really need a quantum sensor or a PPF meter. Thanks for listening. We'll
[09:52.580 --> 09:55.460]  talk to you again soon. Bye.
