[01:08.990 --> 01:09.990]  I'm Rasta Jeff.
[01:09.990 --> 01:10.990]  I'm Rasta Jeff.
[01:11.030 --> 01:13.570]  Like I said, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[01:13.570 --> 01:17.630]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[01:17.630 --> 01:21.590]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:21.590 --> 01:22.590]  I'm your host.
[01:22.590 --> 01:24.110]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:24.110 --> 01:26.590]  Sitting across the table from me today is our good buddy White Mike.
[01:26.590 --> 01:27.590]  How you doing bro?
[01:27.590 --> 01:28.590]  I'm doing well man.
[01:28.590 --> 01:29.590]  How are you?
[01:29.590 --> 01:30.590]  I am great dude.
[01:30.590 --> 01:32.470]  I may have fallen asleep on the couch for a couple hours.
[01:32.470 --> 01:35.570]  When you got here, I may have been a little bit groggy, but I think I've got my shit together
[01:35.570 --> 01:36.570]  by now.
[01:36.570 --> 01:37.570]  Naps are good for your health.
[01:37.570 --> 01:38.570]  Naps are really good for you.
[01:38.570 --> 01:41.950]  a bunch of dabs, eat a bunch of food and then you wake up on the couch wondering where time
[01:41.950 --> 01:47.350]  went right feeling all refreshed. We're good. We're back in the game. So I'm doing great,
[01:47.350 --> 01:50.930]  man. Thanks for coming today, bro. Yeah, happy to happy to. It's I think the listeners like
[01:50.930 --> 01:54.570]  having you on because we get a lot of listens when you're here. Nice. You guys before we
[01:54.570 --> 01:58.270]  get too far. I wanted to give a big thank you shout out to the mystic roots band. Big
[01:58.270 --> 02:02.610]  thanks to cat coot and the entire mystic roots crew. They let me play their music on my show.
[02:02.610 --> 02:05.690]  They don't ask me for anything in return. That's super kind of them. Make sure you guys
[02:05.690 --> 02:11.690]  support mystic roots. In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez is the most beautiful woman in reggae.
[02:11.690 --> 02:14.930]  So make sure you check that out. Big shout out to the coot or the mystic roots cat and
[02:14.930 --> 02:19.250]  coot from the mystic roots band. Shout out. So we've got some cool shit lined up today
[02:19.250 --> 02:25.250]  to talk about. But first, I want to kind of brag about my good ass weekend. Thursday,
[02:25.250 --> 02:29.130]  I think I recorded since this Thursday. I saw Israel vibration, right? Yeah, we talked
[02:29.130 --> 02:33.970]  about that. So Saturday, my phone is too close to the recording equipment. It's making weird
[02:33.970 --> 02:38.610]  noises. Just go and throw that across the damn room. There we go. Saturday. Yeah, by
[02:38.610 --> 02:44.250]  phone. Get out of here. We don't need you for a minute. Saturday, we I went up to comedy
[02:44.250 --> 02:50.410]  works to go see our good friend Doug Benson again for probably the 15th or 20th ish time.
[02:50.410 --> 02:55.010]  I went to work full disclosure. Well, thanks for keeping the shop on lock and holding everything
[02:55.010 --> 03:00.090]  down while Rasta Jeff was up seeing Doug Benson. Somebody got a hustle. Yeah, this is the truth.
[03:00.090 --> 03:03.690]  So I didn't have anybody to go with me Saturday. I thought I had some plans. They didn't work
[03:04.410 --> 03:08.450]  out. The person I wanted to go with me was unable to go Saturday. So I went up there
[03:08.450 --> 03:13.250]  and I had two tickets. And I walked up to the line and there was another dude by himself
[03:13.250 --> 03:17.490]  walking up to the line looked kind of confused, holding like his printed ticket and shit.
[03:17.490 --> 03:20.250]  I could tell he was a noob to comedy works that he'd never been there and he was trying
[03:20.250 --> 03:24.410]  to figure out the comedy works lifestyle. So I watched him fumble around and I started
[03:24.410 --> 03:27.610]  conversation with him. He lit up a blunt. We smoked a blunt there in the part in the
[03:27.610 --> 03:32.170]  line at comedy works. And then he goes, man, he asked me a question about comedy works.
[03:32.170 --> 03:35.010]  I don't remember what he said specifically. And I go, Oh, no worries, man. You can totally
[03:35.010 --> 03:39.530]  do that here. You'll be just fine. And as we walked in, he went to get his ticket. And
[03:39.530 --> 03:41.810]  I go, man, you don't even need your ticket. You're going to sit with me tonight. He goes,
[03:41.810 --> 03:44.770]  what? And I go, you want to sit front row, bro? And he goes, no, you're shitting me.
[03:44.770 --> 03:48.930]  And I go, yeah, man, I got two front row passes. Let's go sit in the front row. And so anybody
[03:48.930 --> 03:53.330]  that knows me that listens to the show, I'm going to brag a little bit. I've got two lifetime
[03:53.330 --> 03:56.450]  preferred seating passes for comedy works in downtown Denver. All I've got to do is
[03:56.450 --> 04:00.730]  let them know that I'm coming and I will be seated in seat 12, which is the front two
[04:00.810 --> 04:04.730]  seats right there in front of the stage, right where the comedians are spitting and drooling
[04:04.730 --> 04:07.610]  and sweating and staring you in the face and making fun of you and putting you in part
[04:07.610 --> 04:08.610]  of the show.
[04:08.610 --> 04:11.370]  To be part of the show section is how I like to think of it.
[04:11.370 --> 04:15.130]  Yeah. I get, I get made fun of every time I sit there. If it can be, if I sit there,
[04:15.130 --> 04:18.530]  so it's great. So I take this brand new stranger.
[04:18.530 --> 04:20.050]  Tall Wookiee in the front row.
[04:20.050 --> 04:24.250]  With huge dreadlocks and a huge cheesy smile. Yeah. They love me down there in the front.
[04:24.250 --> 04:27.370]  They'll love to make fun of me. So I took this new dude that I'd never met until that
[04:27.370 --> 04:30.610]  day. He was having kind of a bad day up until then. I was like, bro, just come with me.
[04:31.490 --> 04:33.690]  And we'll go sit front row. And he sat front row and he had the time of his fucking life,
[04:33.690 --> 04:36.690]  dude. He laughed his ass off. He gave me a hug and shit at the end of the night. He's
[04:36.690 --> 04:38.290]  like, bro, that was so cool. Thank you.
[04:38.290 --> 04:41.850]  A shout out to my buddy Merlin. If you're listening, bro, it was good meeting you, man.
[04:41.850 --> 04:46.050]  That was a good time. So after the show, we go meet Doug Benson. I get stoned.
[04:46.050 --> 04:49.770]  I hang out with Doug Benson. Actually, it was really cool because it was a Doug loves
[04:49.770 --> 04:54.690]  movies podcast and Harlan Williams was a fucking guest. Harlan is one of my favorite comedians.
[04:54.690 --> 04:59.890]  That was fucking awesome. Pete Davidson or Davison from Saturday night live was another
[04:59.890 --> 05:04.210]  guest and Doug's friend and a comedian I've seen several times. Jeff Tate was the third
[05:04.210 --> 05:09.650]  guest. Nice. So I got stoned with Jeff Tate doesn't smoke pot, but he hung out with us
[05:09.650 --> 05:13.530]  and Doug Benson definitely smoked. I got stoned with a whole bunch of cool ass people in the
[05:13.530 --> 05:17.130]  crowd and then I drove back to Pueblo. Actually, the mellow mushroom. And then I was still
[05:17.130 --> 05:21.610]  hungry. So I also ate at the Chiba Hut because I'm a pothead and I'm a fat fuck. So that
[05:21.610 --> 05:25.610]  shit was delicious. Drove home. And when you're in food country, you got to stop and get some.
[05:25.610 --> 05:28.690]  Yeah. When you drive past both of those restaurants, you're like, well, I'm eating here. There's
[05:28.690 --> 05:32.170]  just no stopping it. Shout out to my friend Tiffany over at the mellow mushroom. Thanks
[05:32.170 --> 05:35.530]  for a delicious meal. That was awesome. He took good care of me. Great waitressing. I
[05:35.530 --> 05:40.610]  like it. So Saturday, Sunday, did it all over again. I had a beautiful date Sunday. She
[05:40.610 --> 05:44.610]  was able to go with me Sunday. Went up there and saw Doug Benson do standup comedy. He
[05:44.610 --> 05:49.290]  tore it the fuck up. That was amazing. He made fun of me a little bit both nights. So
[05:49.290 --> 05:55.130]  that was cool. Two days of Doug Benson hanging out with Doug Benson the second night he treated
[05:55.130 --> 06:01.330]  me. It was not even like some celebrity and his fan hanging out. Jeff Tate walked up to
[06:01.330 --> 06:06.090]  me and asked me a question. He had a question for me because I, I was part of the show at
[06:06.090 --> 06:10.330]  the end of the show. They play games and they play a game called the last man. Stanton.
[06:10.330 --> 06:14.970]  The thing is somebody in the audience names an actor and then the participants in the
[06:14.970 --> 06:18.730]  game have to name movies that that actor has been in until they run out.
[06:18.730 --> 06:23.290]  And we just keep going back and forth until one of us can't do no more. And so Doug knew
[06:23.450 --> 06:26.890]  that I listened to the podcast. So he's like, Ross did Jeff will definitely have a name for us.
[06:26.890 --> 06:30.410]  We'll go to him for a name in just a minute. So he let me give him the name. And when it came
[06:30.410 --> 06:33.050]  time to it, I said, I have two names in my head. Do you want me to give you two of them? And he
[06:33.050 --> 06:36.170]  pick one? He goes, Nope, just give me one and we'll do it. And I was like, all right. So the
[06:36.170 --> 06:41.370]  name I gave them for the game was a Philip Seymour Hoffman, because I mean, he's got a lot of
[06:41.370 --> 06:44.890]  fucking movies and they should know a lot of them. So it was really good. They liked it. They had a
[06:44.890 --> 06:49.050]  lot of fun with it. So after the show, Jeff Tate walked up and he's like, who was your other name,
[06:49.050 --> 06:53.210]  bro? And it's funny because I always forget the guy's fucking name. And I had it like in my head
[06:53.210 --> 06:56.810]  right at that moment for when he asked what I'd forgotten it because I knew my time was up and I
[06:56.810 --> 07:00.570]  go, I forgot, dude. And he goes, Oh, you know, and I go, yeah, but I always forget his name.
[07:00.570 --> 07:04.570]  And I said, he played the president in mocking. And before I could say mocking,
[07:04.570 --> 07:08.810]  Jay goes, Oh, fucking Donald Sutherland, dude. And hit me on the shoulder. So that dude knows
[07:08.810 --> 07:12.330]  his fucking movies. Jeff Tate knows his movies real well. Shout out to Jeff Tate. They made me
[07:12.330 --> 07:17.130]  feel like a friend. Like those guys treat me like I am a homie now. When I walk through comedy works,
[07:17.130 --> 07:20.490]  I get high fives. Uh, they don't even walk me to my seat anymore. They're like, you're,
[07:20.490 --> 07:24.090]  you know where your fucking seat is. Go have a seat. Enjoy your night. Right. Yeah.
[07:24.090 --> 07:26.890]  Dude. Comedy works is awesome. I used to go there a lot in college.
[07:26.890 --> 07:34.810]  That's uh, I'm, I love going to music shows, but some music crowds are assholes. Yep. The crowds
[07:34.810 --> 07:38.410]  have evolved into assholes that want to shove their way to the front and spill their beer on
[07:38.410 --> 07:41.530]  you and just be a disrespectful dick and don't appreciate the show. And they kind of ruined
[07:41.530 --> 07:46.010]  some concerts for me. I started enjoying sitting in the back and getting high as shit a long time
[07:46.010 --> 07:50.010]  ago. Right. Yeah. Concerts are getting different as I'm getting older, but comedy shows, they don't
[07:50.010 --> 07:53.770]  allow any of that pushing and shoving bullshit. They'll kick you right out if you heckle. So
[07:53.770 --> 07:57.450]  you're sitting down the whole time and you can order food and they bring it to you. So comedy
[07:57.450 --> 08:01.850]  shows have been kind of my new go-to thing for a date or for some fun. It's really great to take
[08:01.850 --> 08:05.050]  a girl out and see a pretty girl smile at a comedy show. Shout out to my date. I don't think you
[08:05.050 --> 08:08.570]  listen to the show, but you know who you are. I had a great time with you. All right. That's
[08:08.570 --> 08:12.810]  another local comedy. Do support local comedy. Shout out to the, uh, wild cousins comedy. Shout
[08:12.890 --> 08:16.650]  out to all the Pueblo comedy crew. Much love, much respect. All right. We've been talking about
[08:16.650 --> 08:20.970]  everything, but cannabis on this podcast for the past 10 minutes. Time for some weed. Let's talk
[08:20.970 --> 08:25.210]  about cannabis. Actually. Let's not talk about weed. Let's fucking smoke some hash. You want to
[08:25.210 --> 08:30.890]  take a dab with me, bro? I would love a dab. Uh, Gorilla glue or girl scout cookies. Now let's,
[08:30.890 --> 08:35.690]  let's take a quick second here. Do you realize what I just asked you? I do. There are people
[08:35.690 --> 08:42.090]  in places that are probably just smacking their SMDH smack my damn head right now. I know it's
[08:42.090 --> 08:45.610]  shake my damn head, but I always, I thought of it as smack my damn head. Yeah. Smack myself.
[08:46.490 --> 08:49.930]  Yeah. That's what I thought of it when I first saw it. But, uh, there's somebody just went,
[08:49.930 --> 08:54.490]  this motherfucker has got girl scout cookies and Gorilla glue just sitting there ready to smoke.
[08:54.490 --> 08:58.890]  Yes. You guys. And it's not even flowers. It's the most beautiful hash you've ever seen.
[08:58.890 --> 09:04.010]  We're we're kind of spoiled here. We are spoiled here. Anyway, Mike, yes. For legalization while
[09:04.010 --> 09:09.850]  we're on it. Yes. But when you do make sure that you include some sort of law or paragraph,
[09:10.810 --> 09:15.690]  if it allows you to have some sort of consumption place where everybody can gather and smoke
[09:15.690 --> 09:19.050]  cannabis, cause that's what we missed here in Colorado. And right now we're struggling to get
[09:19.050 --> 09:22.570]  those types of rules in place. Would you like some wonderful news? I would like the yes,
[09:22.570 --> 09:26.010]  dude, enlighten me. But before you do, uh, let's make a decision here. Would you like the girl
[09:26.010 --> 09:29.450]  scout cookies or would you like the Gorilla glue? I was going to go with the Gorilla glue only
[09:29.450 --> 09:34.010]  because right before we started recording, we did sample the girl scout cookies. Yes, we did. All
[09:34.010 --> 09:39.690]  right. So it was quite wonderful. But I coughed for quite a bit. So I'm hoping the gorilla glue
[09:39.690 --> 09:43.290]  will be slightly less choky for me. I'm going to give you a little dab. Mike's kind of Mike.
[09:44.650 --> 09:49.850]  Why don't I no shame people take the dab you want. You've got somebody else's taking. That's
[09:49.850 --> 09:53.370]  the truth. You guys. Yeah. You don't have to dab like I do take a dab. That's comfortable for you.
[09:54.250 --> 09:58.570]  Mike just said that he had some news to share. I'm going to make Mike share his news before he
[09:58.570 --> 10:02.810]  takes this dab because like we just talked about, he's going to cough for 30 seconds and then this
[10:02.810 --> 10:07.290]  dab will be your reward for a quick cough. Just thinking about it. Yeah. This dab is your reward
[10:07.290 --> 10:10.730]  that is waiting for you. And I'm going to dab while you tell us about your news. So I got a
[10:10.730 --> 10:17.610]  text a few days ago from a local friend of mine in the industry down here. Um, he's always been
[10:17.610 --> 10:22.410]  kind of a step removed. Um, he's like, he's not an owner of a dispenser or anything like that,
[10:23.210 --> 10:28.410]  but, uh, he got me a text saying he had a licensing hearing. He needed, he wanted me to attend
[10:29.130 --> 10:37.610]  and, uh, he received his, uh, special use permit to open a cannabis museum slash consumption
[10:37.610 --> 10:42.970]  location here in Pueblo County. Is this somebody that I know? Yep. Cool. Is it the person I think
[10:42.970 --> 10:46.730]  I know? Probably. Okay, cool. I think I know who you're talking about. We'll talk about specifics
[10:46.730 --> 10:50.490]  off the air. Shout out greener side empire. Yeah, I totally know who you're talking about. Yeah.
[10:50.490 --> 10:53.690]  Shout out old school greener side empire. What up Hanky B hope you're doing well, homie.
[10:54.010 --> 10:58.570]  Yep. Uh, it's not, it's not Hanky. No, no. But when you say greener side empire, that's,
[10:58.570 --> 11:02.890]  yeah, that's, that is the King of the greener side. Yeah. What up shorter dude with curly hair
[11:05.690 --> 11:12.570]  So look for that comment. Um, so a cannabis museum, uh, during the licensing hearing,
[11:12.570 --> 11:19.210]  his description of it would be a marijuana themed hard rock cafe would be the closest,
[11:19.210 --> 11:24.410]  um, business that he could relate it to that everyone's familiar with. So when you sit down
[11:24.410 --> 11:29.850]  at your, your booth with, uh, the marijuana product, you bring yourself, there'll be stuff
[11:29.850 --> 11:34.410]  on the wall. That's like marijuana was originally outlawed and da da da da da da, like historical
[11:34.410 --> 11:39.290]  stuff. And they've hired local historians, like professional historians that do this for a living
[11:39.290 --> 11:44.250]  and are currently researching cannabis because there isn't a local historian who expert, uh,
[11:44.810 --> 11:52.890]  word lost in the mind who focuses, who focuses, specializes in cannabis history. I suppose I
[11:52.890 --> 11:57.610]  could have qualified, but I didn't know that was a job I could have had. They need to come to
[11:57.610 --> 12:01.050]  somebody, all of the schooling will be great and useful, but then they need to come to somebody
[12:01.050 --> 12:05.050]  involved in it, right. To get it. I'm sure they've got a couple of people like us on the team. And
[12:05.050 --> 12:09.610]  if they don't, I'm going to be that person on the team for them. Uh, if at all possible,
[12:10.570 --> 12:16.250]  the dab rock cafe, if you will. Um, I I'm sure it's got a name, but I don't, I don't honestly
[12:16.250 --> 12:22.410]  remember it, but yeah, that should be coming here. Um, earliest estimates, first of the year,
[12:22.410 --> 12:28.410]  um, knowing how these things go sometimes I'm going to say by end of spring, we should have
[12:28.410 --> 12:34.570]  a place to go and, uh, enjoy some cannabis out in the public. You know what? Well, it was in a
[12:34.570 --> 12:39.130]  business that's private members only, but will that be in the city of Pueblo or in the County
[12:39.370 --> 12:43.210]  just into the County, just into the County. All right, come on city of Pueblo. You guys want that
[12:43.210 --> 12:47.930]  damn tax money, but you won't let us have anything in the city. Yup. They, uh, Pueblo County passed
[12:47.930 --> 12:54.330]  rules and regs for public consumption shops. A while ago, there's only been one other applicant
[12:54.330 --> 12:59.690]  that I know of to try and they fucked it up so hard. It was painful to watch. I think I remember
[12:59.690 --> 13:03.930]  hearing about that. I was really pissed that they did it because that set everybody back.
[13:03.930 --> 13:08.810]  It's like six months. Ouch. All right, guys. So you heard it here first, our buddy Mike reported
[13:08.810 --> 13:13.850]  on it. Mike is our correspondent. Now, suddenly reporter Mike live from the field, Mike, you went
[13:13.850 --> 13:19.530]  a dab, you went a free dab for such a wonderful report on the show here. Uh, there will be a
[13:19.530 --> 13:24.890]  marijuana. I like the word cannabis. There will be a cannabis museum in the County of Pueblo here
[13:24.890 --> 13:29.130]  before too long. That is really cool. Um, Mike said something about public consumption. I am
[13:29.130 --> 13:33.610]  going to humble myself. I'm going to eat a little bit of crow. If you will, on this show, never said
[13:33.610 --> 13:38.250]  eat crow before. Uh, I get the phrase now that I've said it, I understand where it comes in perfectly.
[13:38.250 --> 13:40.810]  I've never said that I've heard it and thought that's a weird phrase, but it just came in
[13:40.810 --> 13:46.490]  perfectly. So shout out to the phrase, eat some crow. It's got its place. Um, why are you grubbing
[13:46.490 --> 13:52.810]  buddy? Well, recently I've had, I've had beef with a couple of people, uh, personal issues,
[13:53.530 --> 14:00.810]  uh, childish bullshit that's stuck in my mind. Uh, and they recently threw a harvest festival
[14:00.810 --> 14:05.850]  here in Pueblo, Colorado, and their event was completely fucking successful. Uh, they crushed
[14:05.850 --> 14:10.810]  it. They had a public consumption event, three blocks from my house on the main street of our
[14:10.810 --> 14:16.250]  town. Our town is called Pueblo. This shit happened on Pueblo Boulevard. Uh, they smoked
[14:16.890 --> 14:22.250]  hash and weed and had a miniature cannabis cup basically in their parking lot, four minutes from
[14:22.250 --> 14:25.850]  my house. I did not attend it because like I said, I was seeing Doug Benson and that was my priority.
[14:26.410 --> 14:32.410]  I was working, but a number of people, um, that I know were there, they said it went off huge.
[14:32.410 --> 14:37.290]  Uh, Spence and Jesse cleaned house. Spence won six awards and Jesse won first place. Jesse's
[14:37.290 --> 14:41.370]  outdoor grape OG beat. I don't know if I'm supposed to say that that shit was outdoor,
[14:41.370 --> 14:48.410]  but Jesse's possibly outdoor grape OG greenhouse beat a greenhouse properly beat a bunch of indoor
[14:48.410 --> 14:52.570]  weeds. So shout out to Jesse for his victory. Shout out to Spence for six fucking awards,
[14:52.570 --> 14:57.530]  dude. Home runs boys. Nice. But you know what? I've got, uh, I've had personal issues with those
[14:57.530 --> 15:04.410]  people and it's my choice over possibly business issues, uh, that were legal involving a store.
[15:04.410 --> 15:08.090]  Uh, but, uh, even though we've got a little bit of beef, we don't get along. We don't see eye to
[15:08.090 --> 15:12.250]  eye on fucking everything. We're all in the same community. Uh, they pulled it off. I'm proud of
[15:12.250 --> 15:15.690]  them. I'm going to give them a shout out right here. Shout out to Terry. Shout out to fucking
[15:15.690 --> 15:20.010]  Ryan. You guys did it. You see that big old fucking plate of crow right here at the fucking
[15:20.010 --> 15:23.850]  grow from your heart podcast. I'm fucking feasting on it. You guys, I'm saying it out loud. They did
[15:23.850 --> 15:28.970]  it. I'm proud of them. Nice work. You guys, no sarcasm. Like I'm a smart ass and I'm fucking,
[15:28.970 --> 15:34.090]  I'm straight face right here. Good work. You guys. I hear that turnout was way bigger than
[15:34.090 --> 15:37.690]  they were expecting and that they've had a previous events and I'm going to go to the
[15:37.690 --> 15:40.890]  next event that they throw. Like I've never gone to one of their events for personal,
[15:41.530 --> 15:46.090]  personal, stupid shit. Uh, and I'm a stubborn asshole, uh, something in me. If I don't like
[15:46.090 --> 15:49.290]  you for something you've done in the past, I'm probably not going to like you in the future,
[15:49.290 --> 15:53.290]  but I see them trying to make progress. I've tried to work with those people before and we
[15:53.290 --> 15:57.450]  just butt heads and so I've kind of separated myself, but I'm going to get over it and I'm
[15:57.450 --> 16:01.290]  going to go to their next event cause they crushed it this time. All right. So I had to man up there
[16:01.290 --> 16:05.850]  for a minute. I feel better. All right. Uh, Mike, you look perplexed. You've got a weird look on
[16:05.850 --> 16:12.970]  your face. No, I just, um, I wish I would've gone to that. Like when I heard how well it went,
[16:12.970 --> 16:16.170]  I was bummed that I had to work all weekend. Right? Yeah. I kind of wish that I would've gone.
[16:16.170 --> 16:20.810]  And that's fully the first time I felt about one of their events and they finally did it right from
[16:20.810 --> 16:24.650]  what I hear. I'm going to try. I haven't heard about any blowback from it either. Nothing
[16:24.650 --> 16:28.250]  happens. Really nothing went, nothing wrong went on. Yeah. It went smoothly without a,
[16:28.250 --> 16:33.530]  with like, yeah, yeah. Well it's been several days. It's Wednesday now. Uh, it's about to be
[16:33.530 --> 16:38.090]  Thursday, so nothing's going to happen. I'm probably Saturday. If it's not in the Saturday
[16:38.090 --> 16:44.250]  morning paper then Sunday paper. All right. Um, so I was going to say I was going to try not to
[16:44.250 --> 16:49.130]  miss any Doug Benson shows at comedy works. I'm gonna try to get as many as I can because, uh,
[16:49.130 --> 16:52.730]  if you tweet Doug Benson, he will read your tweets during the first 20 minutes of his show.
[16:52.730 --> 16:56.890]  That's what he does. He just reads tweets and makes fun of people. And so, uh, I just tweeted
[16:56.890 --> 17:01.850]  at him, Hey Doug front row again, feels like home. And so he read a bunch of tweets and he goes, uh,
[17:01.850 --> 17:05.930]  this guy back here says, where's whatever my tweeter name. And he's like, I'm over here.
[17:05.930 --> 17:10.730]  And he goes, his tweet says I'm way too high. Ha ha ha. And he goes, speaking of way too high
[17:10.730 --> 17:16.570]  Rasta Jeff's in the front row again. And people fucking cheered, dude, they clapped and shit.
[17:16.650 --> 17:21.610]  And he goes, Rasta Jeff's been in the front row in that seat for the last 18 Doug Benson shows.
[17:21.610 --> 17:24.890]  He hasn't missed a show yet. That was so funny. I'm going to try not to miss any,
[17:24.890 --> 17:28.410]  dude. It's going to be a good time. If the listeners out there want this experience,
[17:28.410 --> 17:32.570]  the way to do it is amazing. We don't tell them every Doug Benson show. It's just the
[17:32.570 --> 17:38.330]  gut. The slot in Denver is taken. If your ass lives in Cincinnati, like there's a way to do this,
[17:38.330 --> 17:42.810]  uh, go bananas. I think that's the club in Cincinnati. Maybe dude, if that's,
[17:42.810 --> 17:46.090]  see, like, I almost want to Google that shit. Let's I'm going to take fucking 30 seconds.
[17:46.810 --> 17:49.610]  We might pause it. We might not. Let's see. We're going to have Siri do it.
[17:50.730 --> 17:54.810]  Yeah. I've been a Doug fan for a long time. I got to start scheduling some of these off work.
[17:56.570 --> 17:59.050]  We'll see. I just asked Siri, where's the club go bananas.
[18:00.170 --> 18:06.090]  Live stand up since a fucking natty, bro. I'm such a comedy geek. Go bananas. You've listened
[18:06.090 --> 18:10.410]  to a lot of podcasts. I do. I love comedy. Comedy is one of my favorite fucking things. I, all right.
[18:10.410 --> 18:14.170]  Cause we've been rambling on for like 20 minutes. Let's get onto a topic here. We've got a couple
[18:14.170 --> 18:19.530]  of things in the news that we can talk about. Um, I read an article. I'm not going to read you the
[18:19.530 --> 18:25.610]  article cause it's forever long. It's way too many words long, but I found this article on a website
[18:25.610 --> 18:30.090]  called the guardian. Mike also read it. So we'll, we'll be able to discuss it without reading it
[18:30.090 --> 18:33.050]  here on the show. And we'll be able to paraphrase a little bit for you guys and tell you what it's
[18:33.050 --> 18:40.490]  about. Essentially. Um, they're talking about an influx of people coming from across the country
[18:40.490 --> 18:47.850]  to Pueblo, Colorado, because Pueblo, Colorado for the size of the city that we are and for, uh,
[18:47.850 --> 18:53.290]  our economic development and the amount of cannabis jobs available, we are, uh, the most
[18:53.290 --> 18:58.010]  affordable place to land when you come from out of state. Would you agree with that? Mike?
[18:58.890 --> 19:05.770]  Um, we're routinely ranked as like the cheapest city in Colorado, um, for our size and for our
[19:05.770 --> 19:09.370]  size. Yeah. Right. If you went to anywhere smaller, you're pretty much fucked. Like the next
[19:09.370 --> 19:14.970]  smaller town, like you have to have a shitload of money to live in nowhere land. And this is,
[19:15.530 --> 19:19.610]  there's, there's a hundred thousand people here, which is just about perfect for coming to a city.
[19:19.610 --> 19:24.330]  That's not too expensive. Trying to get a new start. It's not too big. It's one of the cheapest
[19:24.650 --> 19:28.250]  cities in the U S recently. It's it's yeah. We're going to bring that up later.
[19:28.250 --> 19:31.610]  Denver can spit some people out. Denver can chew you up and spit you out. Well,
[19:31.610 --> 19:36.330]  there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff. A lot of reasons people are moving to Pueblo right now.
[19:36.330 --> 19:40.650]  Um, legal marijuana is definitely one of them. Yes. But, uh, let's dive into the story. Cause
[19:40.650 --> 19:44.890]  I'm about to talk about a bunch of shit. We should get you fired up. I want to get you.
[19:44.890 --> 19:50.730]  It's like a pull on the fucking, on the chainsaw. I've been a part of this. I was a part of this
[19:50.730 --> 19:55.770]  story in like a backroom sense. I've met with all the players about this topic, but don't
[19:55.770 --> 20:00.330]  spill too many of those beans. I won't read away. Uh, we're not going to read it, but we'll talk
[20:00.330 --> 20:04.650]  about it. So they're saying that, uh, all of these people moving to Pueblo, Colorado,
[20:04.650 --> 20:10.490]  uh, are beginning to put a burden on our resources here. Uh, we have a resource called Posada,
[20:10.490 --> 20:15.450]  which is a nonprofit organization that helps families, uh, uh, get their, their selves on
[20:15.450 --> 20:20.330]  their feet. If something happens to somebody here in Pueblo, they can go to Posada. Uh, for example,
[20:20.330 --> 20:23.930]  there's a guy in this news article that hurt his foot. Something fell on him and broke his foot and
[20:23.930 --> 20:27.770]  he can't work for a little bit. So he's going to Posada to get a little bit of help. Maybe,
[20:27.770 --> 20:30.650]  I don't know what they're giving him, possibly some food, probably some cheese, you know what
[20:30.650 --> 20:35.290]  I'm saying? Just to keep him on his feet while he's unable to work. But they're saying that those,
[20:35.290 --> 20:41.210]  uh, resources at Posada are being strained and that people are coming from all over the nation
[20:41.210 --> 20:44.570]  to come work here. And they're not prepared. Mike, you look like you got something on your
[20:44.570 --> 20:48.570]  mind already. You're stewing. No, it's, um, so what they're getting at is that, uh,
[20:49.290 --> 20:56.810]  legal marijuana is creating a huge homeless problem in Pueblo, Colorado. Right. Um, and it's
[20:56.810 --> 21:02.570]  not like causing good, hardworking Americans who got hooked on marijuana to become homeless. It's
[21:02.570 --> 21:08.730]  attracting homeless people in other areas to Pueblo apparently. Um, and the article goes on
[21:08.730 --> 21:16.970]  to cite people that work, um, at Posada and a couple other agencies in town, um, saying that
[21:16.970 --> 21:23.770]  they've had huge increases in people seeking services from them, whether it's a housing
[21:23.770 --> 21:32.170]  vouchers or, um, food stamps or from medicine bank, um, medicine vouchers or help with medical,
[21:32.170 --> 21:40.730]  uh, problems. Um, Posada especially has been pretty vocal with the press down here in Pueblo.
[21:40.730 --> 21:45.850]  And then it's spiraled nationally, uh, when the anti-pot groups picked it up and started pushing
[21:45.930 --> 21:52.490]  other newspapers, started picking it up. Um, that one of the problems caused by amendment 64 is more
[21:52.490 --> 22:00.010]  homeless people, um, coming to Colorado because of our marijuana laws. And just that idea never
[22:00.010 --> 22:05.930]  really made sense to me until I realized that it's not illegal to be homeless most places,
[22:05.930 --> 22:12.410]  but it is illegal to have pop most places. And homeless people have huge rates of substance
[22:12.410 --> 22:18.890]  abuse. And if, um, if you're homeless consuming substances as a way to deal with some of the
[22:18.890 --> 22:25.610]  miserable conditions in that lifestyle. Absolutely. Um, so if you can move to a place where they're
[22:25.610 --> 22:30.490]  not going to chase you around and throw you in jail for having some weed, why not be there?
[22:31.290 --> 22:36.170]  And when that's combined with a number of other things that are happening at the same time,
[22:36.170 --> 22:41.930]  like legal marijuana here, everybody's talking about how many thousands of people are working
[22:41.930 --> 22:46.570]  in the industry and how much money it's making. No one's talking about what it takes to get an
[22:46.570 --> 22:51.930]  MED badge. So that's something I was going to touch on in a few minutes when you're homeless
[22:51.930 --> 22:56.650]  and there's a new booming industry. I mean, it's humans have been doing it since
[22:56.650 --> 23:01.930]  humans started doing anything. We move forward to where there's work, um, especially when there's no
[23:01.930 --> 23:07.610]  work and we're just coming out of a depression, like a national depression where works hard to
[23:07.610 --> 23:13.930]  come by everywhere, especially in our age demographic. Do you remember all those articles
[23:13.930 --> 23:19.530]  about people in their thirties that moved home after college? Right. Oh, fuck load of them.
[23:20.570 --> 23:24.890]  We all got degrees. How to not, I'm not saying me, but a lot of them got degrees on like internet
[23:24.890 --> 23:28.810]  stuff. And now those jobs are all taken up. That shit kind of failed, but not failed. But I mean,
[23:28.810 --> 23:32.330]  it's just gotten so much easier to make a webpage that that guy that used to know how to do it.
[23:33.130 --> 23:36.410]  And I have, I have a theory that that's going to happen to the weed grower too. I'm going to do a
[23:36.410 --> 23:40.890]  whole report on that here on the podcast in the future. So yeah, those, those people are now in
[23:40.890 --> 23:48.730]  the weed industry, making a pretty solid living. Yeah. Um, so there's a lot of reasons homeless
[23:48.730 --> 23:55.290]  people are, or people on the brink of being homeless or moving to Colorado. And I mean,
[23:55.290 --> 24:00.010]  I've said it countless times, like, if you want to come here, that's great, but come prepared.
[24:00.010 --> 24:03.930]  Right. That's like, look what I wrote. Come prepared is one of the, seriously,
[24:03.930 --> 24:07.690]  that's writing on this fucking paper. Come prepared. Um, that's huge. And a lot of people
[24:07.690 --> 24:15.050]  didn't like when you're kind of at the end of your road financially in opportunity wise, wherever you
[24:15.050 --> 24:21.130]  live and you hear about Colorado and everything that's going on here, all the stores, all the
[24:21.130 --> 24:27.770]  grows. I mean, you figure at least I can get a job trimming. Right. Um, I can sit in a room and cut
[24:27.770 --> 24:33.130]  leaves off buds all day. I can surely do it in scrubs. Like I'll move there and do it, but no one
[24:33.130 --> 24:38.730]  knows what that takes. Right. You guys, if you're going to cut and, uh, come prepared, that's
[24:38.730 --> 24:42.410]  definitely the thing. Come here with a little bit of money. Cause it's going to take a minute to get
[24:42.410 --> 24:47.930]  a job in the weed industry. You have to get before you even come here, research a Colorado
[24:47.930 --> 24:52.970]  marijuana enforcement division support badge. Yeah. If you're coming here for work in the
[24:52.970 --> 24:56.490]  industry, definitely know what it takes to get a job in the industry. You're not going to get a
[24:56.490 --> 25:01.210]  job trimming for your, you may get a job trimming for your cousin or whatever, but that shit's not
[25:01.210 --> 25:05.770]  going to last long. That's not going to, that's not going to sustain you. It may sound fruitful
[25:05.770 --> 25:10.890]  right now, but trimming for your buddy or trimming for whoever's got this girl option, option, uh,
[25:10.890 --> 25:15.130]  for you, it's not going to work unless it's a legal, like unless they own a business.
[25:15.130 --> 25:20.250]  There's a lot of, a lot of people that have lived here or have recently moved here with kind of a
[25:20.250 --> 25:25.690]  plan and gotten a job that are growing their legal six plants and they need help trimming. And they'll
[25:25.690 --> 25:31.690]  call you and you can trim for them for like 10 hours once every 90 days. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And
[25:31.690 --> 25:36.010]  it's unreliable. You need to, you need to work for like five of those people if you want to try to
[25:36.010 --> 25:40.890]  pay rent that way. Right. And you're not going to find four others right when you move here.
[25:40.890 --> 25:44.570]  I hate it that the trimmers I use go trim for other people, but I mean, it's expected, but I
[25:44.570 --> 25:49.770]  hate that shit. I hate it. That's like them seeing under my skirt or something, but, and then go tell
[25:49.770 --> 25:53.690]  everybody else what was under there. But yeah, if you're not trimming, if you don't need a med
[25:53.690 --> 25:57.690]  badge, that's probably not a job that's going to last for very long right now. They're cleaning up
[25:57.690 --> 26:01.930]  illegal grow operations. They're getting rid of all of that shit here in Colorado. It's going away.
[26:01.930 --> 26:06.730]  So when things are legal, the illegal stands out like a sore thumb. True. Very true. That's
[26:06.730 --> 26:10.490]  something we've talked about on the show. So research, getting your marijuana enforcement
[26:10.490 --> 26:14.650]  division support badge. If you've got any drug felonies in the last 10 years, don't even think
[26:14.650 --> 26:18.090]  about coming to Colorado to get a job in the industry. They're not going to give you a badge.
[26:18.090 --> 26:21.690]  If you don't have the badge, you can't walk in the door. We can't let you behind the counter.
[26:21.690 --> 26:27.130]  You can't go in the grow space. You can't trim. You can't deliver. You can't sweep the parking lot.
[26:27.130 --> 26:34.810]  Like I swear to God, get on the website. It takes two seconds. Google Colorado med badge,
[26:35.610 --> 26:42.090]  and it'll come right up. Our security guards are badged with their security service, like trained
[26:42.090 --> 26:45.850]  with their security. They wear their security guard badge and their shirts for their security
[26:45.850 --> 26:50.890]  and their gun all day long. But they are also wearing a marijuana enforcement division badge.
[26:50.890 --> 26:56.170]  They have to have that shit to work there. So they had to go spend an extra, it's like 150 bucks for
[26:56.170 --> 27:01.690]  that badge just to work there. So you guys, if you can't afford $150 badge, and if you can't qualify
[27:01.690 --> 27:06.090]  for that badge, don't come here, please. Because I'm not talking shit to you. I'm not saying don't
[27:06.090 --> 27:08.970]  come here. You're just going to be stuck. You're not going to be able to get in the industry.
[27:08.970 --> 27:11.930]  You're going to be relying on resources here and you're going to make it, it just kind of makes
[27:11.930 --> 27:15.610]  it look shitty. And if you can come here and do something, you're invited. Come on. If you're,
[27:15.610 --> 27:19.210]  if you're able, if you're willing, if you're ready, if you can trim, if you're able to get
[27:19.210 --> 27:23.530]  the badge, we'll take you. But honestly, I'm going to sound like an asshole here.
[27:23.530 --> 27:29.610]  While we're on it, the big four requirements are no drug felonies in 10 years, no felonies,
[27:29.610 --> 27:34.170]  period, in five. It's kind of fucked up that you could have like killed someone and like with your
[27:34.170 --> 27:39.050]  car or something. Five years ago. Yeah. Five years ago and get your badge before the guy who got
[27:39.050 --> 27:44.170]  busted with an out or what is it? Two grams of concentrate in most places. Yeah. Um,
[27:44.730 --> 27:50.250]  it's fucked up world. Uh, yeah, it really is. But so no drug felonies in 10 years,
[27:50.250 --> 27:54.650]  no felonies in five and your student loans and your child support need to be in order.
[27:54.650 --> 27:59.690]  Yes. Now what in order means is you, you means you have to call them and set up a payment plan
[27:59.690 --> 28:03.130]  and make one payment. If you're already paying on it, you're legit. They won't even say you're
[28:03.130 --> 28:07.450]  already paying, paying on it and everything's in good, good order. You're fine. But if you've
[28:07.450 --> 28:13.130]  been ducking child support for, or student loans for awhile, you got to stand up, call Sally May
[28:13.130 --> 28:17.610]  and start making payments. Yep. All they want is a receipt and proof that you're paying. I had to
[28:17.610 --> 28:22.170]  do it. Like I had to go show them that my student loans were in good order. All I had to do is get
[28:22.170 --> 28:25.930]  a thing from both loan companies. It was really easy. I filled out, I printed the application,
[28:25.930 --> 28:29.210]  uh, online. I printed it at home. I filled it out. It took me like 30 minutes to do it,
[28:29.210 --> 28:33.770]  whatever, you know, it's just like a thick job application, but really thorough. Yeah. And then
[28:33.770 --> 28:39.210]  they give it to the FBI who checks it. So you can't just lie. And while they're checking,
[28:39.210 --> 28:43.450]  they're smart as fuck. They take your paperwork and start running it. Then they call you back
[28:43.450 --> 28:48.090]  while it's being ran and they fingerprint you and they take their sweet fucking time fingerprinting
[28:48.090 --> 28:52.410]  you so that if there is anything wrong with your paperwork, if you're illegal, if you've got
[28:52.410 --> 28:57.210]  warrants, they'll come and get your ass right there. I wondered why it took so long. It seemed
[28:57.210 --> 29:02.970]  like the tech was brand new and yet it took her 74 tries to get my index finger. Oh yeah. That
[29:02.970 --> 29:06.970]  fingerprinting thing, that laser reading fingerprinter is hard. It feels like this is
[29:07.690 --> 29:11.610]  after like six tries, right? Yeah. They've actually come and arrested people who've had
[29:12.730 --> 29:16.410]  while they were there. Yeah. They don't fuck around. So one thing I was going to say,
[29:16.410 --> 29:20.730]  and this is going to sound like really rude as fuck. Oh, and take cash when you go to the
[29:20.730 --> 29:24.570]  license place. Oh yeah. They do not take a check or a money order. You got to go to, if you go to
[29:24.570 --> 29:29.530]  the credit card, it's one 50. I don't even want to quote the prices right now because they change
[29:29.530 --> 29:34.570]  all the fucking time. I paid one 50 for mine. Was that a big echo? I didn't hear it. Okay.
[29:34.570 --> 29:37.770]  I've got these headphones on. I just thought I heard echo. As long as we're not echoing in the
[29:37.770 --> 29:43.850]  recording. Oh, you guys, I know it sounds great to pack up your whole life and come to Colorado
[29:43.850 --> 29:48.650]  and enjoy the dispensary and smoke some legal cannabis. And it is, it's amazing. I have a plan,
[29:48.650 --> 29:54.330]  have a plan. It's not as complicated as it sounds. I'm going to use Adam as an example. Unless you're
[29:54.330 --> 29:57.850]  a deep sea fisherman, we've got your fucking job here too. Adam thought he was going to come here
[29:57.850 --> 30:02.250]  and grow some pot and be the king shit of the fucking world. And I'm not talking to shit about
[30:02.250 --> 30:08.010]  Adam. Adam is making it, but Adam is not buying whatever CD came out last week. He's Adam is not
[30:08.010 --> 30:13.210]  going with us to dinner. I work construction with an all winter. Yeah, exactly. See? Yeah. And I'm
[30:13.210 --> 30:16.170]  not trying to add them. I love you, bro. I'm not talking to you. I'm just showed up, realized that
[30:16.170 --> 30:19.690]  that wasn't going to be how it was going to play out and immediately got to work. Yeah. He thought
[30:19.690 --> 30:25.690]  he was going to come here and survive and it was, you can make it. Yeah. If you fight for it,
[30:25.690 --> 30:32.650]  you can make it, but come here with a plan, save up some money, find a job, find a place or two
[30:32.650 --> 30:38.810]  that you want to see to rent. Like have a plan. Yes. Or don't just show up here with a U-Haul
[30:38.810 --> 30:44.890]  truck and $300 in your pocket. Cause you will be homeless in like four days or my, my option for
[30:44.890 --> 30:49.770]  you, which I recommend, which you're going to think I'm a dick, but, uh, save the energy that
[30:49.770 --> 30:54.330]  you were going to use to move here and use that energy to fight for legalization where you are.
[30:54.330 --> 30:58.650]  Just push that over. Yeah. Just do that right where you are. Just gather a bunch of people,
[30:58.650 --> 31:02.890]  uh, get a bunch of like-minded folk. It'd be cool if you can get all the smokers around,
[31:02.890 --> 31:06.650]  but I understand a bunch of potheads. Sometimes you don't want the potheads to go to city council
[31:06.650 --> 31:10.090]  with you. There's a couple of guys you just want to leave behind. We've definitely had more than
[31:10.090 --> 31:14.410]  one walk up and shoot themselves and everybody else in the foot and it sucked. Yeah. Some of
[31:14.410 --> 31:18.890]  those guys, you can just leave them behind, but try to get a, uh, an intelligent group of people,
[31:18.890 --> 31:22.970]  put an ad on Craigslist in your area, say, Hey, I want to fight to legalize cannabis. Let's start a
[31:22.970 --> 31:29.850]  legalization group. And you guys get together and you, uh, make a, uh, a petition and you make a
[31:29.850 --> 31:34.490]  petition and you try to get it put on the ballot for your community that, Hey, we want to make a
[31:34.490 --> 31:39.690]  medical marijuana legalization movement. It's even easier than that. There's already three groups.
[31:39.690 --> 31:44.410]  If you're listening to this in the U S there's already three groups in your state, town and city
[31:44.410 --> 31:49.530]  working on it. You just have to find them normal, find normal, the national organization for the
[31:49.530 --> 31:56.170]  reform of marijuana laws, the project policy, the marijuana policy project. Yes. See, I think I know
[31:56.170 --> 31:59.530]  who I'm reaching for. I just fucking, I have that ADD and then who's our third friend.
[32:00.970 --> 32:05.770]  You said there's three of them. Oh, there's three of them. No, I wasn't thinking of three
[32:05.770 --> 32:13.370]  specific. There's three responsible Ohio and there's fucking one in Maine. Google cannibal
[32:13.770 --> 32:20.330]  cannibal. No, don't Google. The dozen States are voting on marijuana legalization next year.
[32:20.330 --> 32:25.530]  Cannabis advocacy groups for your area is what you want to find and then join that shit and then do
[32:25.530 --> 32:29.930]  what you can. Uh, everybody's got their own gift in life. And if you want to fight for legalization,
[32:29.930 --> 32:34.490]  you have to find where you fit in, find what you can do. My niche is this podcast. My niche is
[32:34.490 --> 32:38.170]  making seeds. My niche is growing like a motherfucker. My niche is taking care of my
[32:38.170 --> 32:43.130]  patients and paying attention to what works for them medicinally and adjusting my gross schedule
[32:43.130 --> 32:48.570]  and my grow nutrients and my gross strains to work for my individual patients, medical needs,
[32:48.570 --> 32:52.810]  which is an art to tell you the fucking truth, to grow enough weed for Mike and enough weed for Doug
[32:52.810 --> 32:57.770]  and the other people that I supply and have the right strains at the right times for these people.
[32:57.770 --> 33:02.410]  It takes a little bit of scheduling and a little bit of foresight. So, uh, whatever you do,
[33:03.370 --> 33:07.850]  if you're a construction worker and you're looking to move here and do construction and smoke weed
[33:07.850 --> 33:12.250]  in the evenings, have as much of a fucking plan about what you're going to do in life as Jeff
[33:12.330 --> 33:18.010]  just laid out right there is like what he does is his niche. Like at least that much you should be
[33:18.010 --> 33:24.490]  getting online and like, Oh, I, you know, I'm a car salesman, find a dozen car dealerships looking
[33:24.490 --> 33:30.250]  for employees before you even consider moving out here. Yeah. Call them, contact them, send them your
[33:30.250 --> 33:35.690]  information, let them know you'll be here whenever looking for a job long before you move out here.
[33:35.690 --> 33:41.370]  The people that moved out here with just a hope and a prayer, most of them have had to beg people
[33:41.370 --> 33:47.690]  for money so that they can haul their ass back home. Um, and that has to suck. Unfortunately,
[33:48.570 --> 33:52.250]  Colorado has become the, not what you know, but who, you know, state,
[33:53.370 --> 33:57.930]  if you want to be in the cannabis industry right now, there's just so many rules and regulations
[33:57.930 --> 34:02.970]  and the tiniest fuck up can cost the shop 10,000 to a hundred thousand bucks that you can lose
[34:02.970 --> 34:07.770]  their licensing. Um, because you did something that half the people that walk in our doors
[34:07.770 --> 34:16.250]  every day, I assume we're doing constantly. Um, so gaining that level of trust in a job
[34:16.250 --> 34:22.970]  interview is a motherfucker. Um, and if your main sales pitch is that you've been high as
[34:22.970 --> 34:28.890]  shit for a decade, like just don't try, like come here and do whatever you've been doing to make a
[34:28.890 --> 34:34.090]  living. If it's selling weed, don't move here. Cause we got stores that do that now. Um, I get
[34:34.090 --> 34:38.090]  to look at a lot of job applications because, uh, anything that goes for the grow department,
[34:38.090 --> 34:44.410]  the job applications get passed to myself and another guy. You would not believe some of the
[34:45.610 --> 34:51.850]  verbiage that I see in job applications, like list your skills, dog. I could grow the sticky,
[34:51.850 --> 34:57.290]  icky fire dog. I got hydro skills with the Z and shit. And we, we honestly, we throw those
[34:57.290 --> 35:02.810]  applications away. Uh, bring a resume, look professional. It is the weed industry, but it
[35:02.810 --> 35:07.530]  is called industry. It's business. We're trying to better our business. We need to make money so
[35:07.530 --> 35:11.930]  we can improve our business. We can open more stores. It's just how business fucking works.
[35:11.930 --> 35:16.090]  Don't come trying to talk like you're a cool gangster and try to impress us. Be professional.
[35:16.090 --> 35:20.570]  Yeah. Legal comes with rules, regulations, and expectations. You're going to be wearing a lab
[35:20.570 --> 35:24.250]  coat. If you work next to me in the grow, I know that sounds ridiculous. We were to lab coats, bro.
[35:24.250 --> 35:27.930]  We've got a different lab coat for each room. I need to know that you're responsible enough to
[35:27.930 --> 35:32.410]  wear this lab coat in room a and know that you need to take that son of a bitch off and put on
[35:32.410 --> 35:37.210]  another lab coat before you enter room B or you need to be aware enough to actually care about
[35:37.210 --> 35:41.130]  cross-contamination. Yeah. Yeah. We need to know that you can read the warning signs when we use
[35:41.130 --> 35:46.090]  a pesticide and we put up a certain do not enter sign or whatever gear is required to enter this
[35:46.090 --> 35:50.410]  room. We do know that you can read that kind of stuff. Even the salespeople, if I make a real
[35:50.410 --> 35:56.810]  simple mistake, I can get the shop shut down. Yeah. Oh yeah. Um, anybody, anybody that works
[35:56.810 --> 36:01.130]  there pretty much with the badge. If we do the right, if we say the wrong shit, the store can
[36:01.130 --> 36:06.490]  be closed at any minute. Yeah. And we're under camera. You guys, you guys think we can hang out
[36:06.490 --> 36:11.130]  and smoke pot and be chill? No, it's busy as fuck all the time. There's no chairs where I work.
[36:11.130 --> 36:16.650]  There are no chairs in my work area. I'm always standing up. Uh, but also we're under camera
[36:17.290 --> 36:21.930]  from every angle at all times. You're on two cameras, no matter where you are in that building,
[36:21.930 --> 36:26.010]  there are two cameras covering that area. I cannot scratch my ass in that building without
[36:26.010 --> 36:31.050]  being seen. If you do something really funny, you can go to the office and ask for the footage.
[36:31.530 --> 36:37.210]  Immediately. Cause it's available. I've had security that was three rooms away. Make fun
[36:37.210 --> 36:43.050]  of me for butt crack. Yeah. And the cameras, everything is on camera to the point where they
[36:43.050 --> 36:50.810]  can read. I driver's licenses. They read the number on my car outside in the parking lot with
[36:50.810 --> 36:54.730]  the camera. Yeah. That's how fucking smooth those cameras were. They were reading VIN numbers on
[36:54.730 --> 37:00.010]  cars. Like people really don't understand the level of regulation and scrutiny that the industry's
[37:00.170 --> 37:04.090]  those cameras go about a hundred feet all the way around the perimeter of the building,
[37:04.090 --> 37:06.890]  all the way, like a hundred feet. Seriously. I'm not even kidding. They go all the way to
[37:06.890 --> 37:10.170]  the street and shit. That's why when you hear about a dispenser, you're getting robbed in
[37:10.170 --> 37:14.170]  Colorado. You hear about the arrest of the guy who did it like an hour and a half later. Right? Yeah.
[37:14.810 --> 37:20.010]  A boy. And it's funny. Cause if somebody smokes anywhere near the building, our security guards
[37:20.010 --> 37:23.930]  damn near run outside with our gun in their hand. You cannot smoke on our premises. You guys,
[37:24.410 --> 37:29.770]  nobody can smoke, but yeah, you can't. He really wants to take, I'm exaggerating. I'm exaggerating.
[37:29.770 --> 37:36.650]  Yes. Uh, but if you cannot smoke anything anywhere near our dispensary, you guys, we can't have,
[37:37.290 --> 37:41.290]  I've mentioned this before, excuse my burping. We cannot have, I'm a medical marijuana patient
[37:41.290 --> 37:47.290]  and I cannot have my, any of my medical marijuana products in my private vehicle on my work shift in
[37:47.290 --> 37:51.690]  my car, parked in the parking lot at the dispensary. I have, I have to wait until I get
[37:51.690 --> 37:56.810]  home. I have to drive home and dab hard after work because I can't have the shit there. Anything
[37:56.810 --> 38:02.730]  that might be seen as on-site consumption could cost the shop its license, right? We can't carry
[38:02.730 --> 38:10.250]  our beverages. Uh, I can't as a, as a guy that works in the back, I can take my bottle, my,
[38:10.250 --> 38:14.250]  my Dr. Pepper after lunch, I can take that back to the back of the building, but they will not
[38:14.250 --> 38:18.890]  let me take my drink into the bud room. When I go visit Mike, when I'm chatting him up, when I'm
[38:18.890 --> 38:24.250]  taking a pee break, like if Mike's, uh, Mike and I hardly ever see each other at work, but when we
[38:24.250 --> 38:29.290]  do, it's like, Hey buddy, no open containers in the bedroom. If you say you were a customer and
[38:29.290 --> 38:34.570]  you spilled that shit in a jar of weed, I couldn't even charge you for what you just ruined. Um,
[38:34.570 --> 38:39.450]  because I can legally only sell you a quarter of an ounce or an ounce depending on where your
[38:39.450 --> 38:46.410]  license says you're from. Um, and so if you're from Texas and you spill your, your water into a
[38:46.490 --> 38:51.850]  jar of weed, the Scotty announces a weed in it. Um, the shop's gotta eat a lot of money.
[38:52.810 --> 38:58.090]  That's my job. Ouch. So can you take your water bottle back there or anything? Only if it's got a
[38:58.090 --> 39:03.210]  lid. Okay. Just a water bottle. And then like, keep it well the fuck away from the bug. That's
[39:03.210 --> 39:06.410]  why I was asking. I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple of water bottles back by that window. Well,
[39:06.410 --> 39:10.970]  it's like the window ledges where they go. That's where they're safe. Yeah. The window ledge. All
[39:10.970 --> 39:14.490]  right, cool. So yeah, that it's strict. You guys, what I'm getting at is there is no hanging out,
[39:14.490 --> 39:19.210]  smoking pot, being lazy, having fun. Uh, the only time I get to groove and have a good time
[39:19.210 --> 39:23.770]  is when I'm pushing a broom or a mop. Like I will catch myself shaking my ass because I got me, we
[39:23.770 --> 39:28.250]  play, we play loud music in the back and there's good music up front most of the time. Uh, so
[39:28.250 --> 39:32.090]  there's good music going on as one of the best parts, but the only time you get to chill out and
[39:32.090 --> 39:37.050]  have fun is on lunch breaks or sometimes we have a little team meetings and shit, which are fun,
[39:37.050 --> 39:40.810]  but it's hard work working in a dispensary. You guys, if you're coming here to work in the
[39:40.810 --> 39:45.530]  industry, be ready to put in work, put in work. Yeah. Don't you guys, I'm serious. If like all
[39:45.530 --> 39:51.770]  day, every day, it never stops. Yeah. Uh, should I go in and nine ish just depends on the day.
[39:51.770 --> 39:55.130]  Some more between eight and 10 just depends on honestly how busy we're going to be. What I've
[39:55.130 --> 39:58.010]  got to do. I know what I've got to do today. I know how much time it's going to take, but sometimes
[39:58.010 --> 40:01.530]  we don't leave there. We've left at seven o'clock before we've gone in at nine in the morning and
[40:01.530 --> 40:06.010]  not we've gone at eight and left at seven. Oh, I've worked several 12 hour days there before.
[40:06.010 --> 40:10.570]  Yeah. You're you guys up front have to work longer shifts because you can't close up there until the
[40:10.570 --> 40:13.850]  time in the back. We can pretty much where, but we just got to finish the job. There's a lot of
[40:13.850 --> 40:18.730]  shit to do in the back. Sometimes it's just what happens in the legal industry. Like there's work
[40:18.730 --> 40:25.610]  to be done and it's got to get done by somebody. And pot takes a lot of work, a lot of planning,
[40:26.410 --> 40:31.850]  a lot of planning for us in the back. People come here with just the craziest expectations.
[40:31.850 --> 40:35.370]  And it's fucked a lot of people. If you're one of those guys that quits a job all the time,
[40:35.370 --> 40:38.010]  if you're one of those guys that can't show up on time, if you're one of the guys that makes
[40:38.010 --> 40:42.650]  excuses, you're not going to make it in the marijuana industry. Come dinner time. Like,
[40:44.570 --> 40:47.530]  yeah, yeah. You got to look professional. You got to take care of yourself here.
[40:48.570 --> 40:54.410]  You guys, this may sound like shit, but this is the truth. For every one dude that is hireable,
[40:54.410 --> 40:59.210]  there are seven women that are hireable that are way more attractive than you. So if you're a dude
[40:59.210 --> 41:03.370]  and you're trying to get a job in the industry, you got to get your shit together because you put
[41:03.370 --> 41:09.370]  a real resume together. Beautiful women sell more weed. So there's already an uphill battle
[41:09.370 --> 41:15.850]  for a lot of you dudes. Clean up. Yeah. Always resume. Resume. All right. Do your shit.
[41:17.290 --> 41:22.650]  Let's see. We've been going for 40 minutes. Holy crap. We're so vague. This is like the
[41:22.650 --> 41:27.050]  longest news article summation. We didn't even read the news articles. We've gone so
[41:27.050 --> 41:30.330]  many different places with this. I like this podcast. It felt right.
[41:32.970 --> 41:39.530]  So just to get slightly back on topic, the thing that pisses me off the most about this whole
[41:39.530 --> 41:46.410]  legal pot causes an increase in homelessness nonsense is like one of the big reasons Pueblo
[41:46.410 --> 41:51.130]  is experiencing a lot more homeless people right now looking for services or people on the brink
[41:51.130 --> 41:56.890]  of being homeless, looking for services is because all of the cities around us currently bus homeless
[41:56.890 --> 42:02.010]  people out of their area. That's the only way they've got to deal with it. If Posada could have
[42:02.010 --> 42:07.050]  anything they wanted right now, it would be millions more funding so that they could send
[42:07.050 --> 42:12.650]  everybody back home. And there's a small reason for that. Like if you send everybody home,
[42:13.450 --> 42:17.370]  hopefully they've got family, friends, people in the community that they know and can make
[42:17.370 --> 42:22.010]  contact with to help them get back on their feet, like somewhere where they're tied to the community
[42:22.010 --> 42:28.650]  a little bit rather than here where they're strangers to everybody. But most places are just
[42:28.650 --> 42:33.610]  like, Hey, guess what? I hear this place up the way that you probably can't get back to without
[42:33.610 --> 42:40.490]  a lot of help is banging. You should go there. Here's a bus ticket there for free, bro. They've
[42:40.490 --> 42:47.850]  got like everything you need. I had a guy ask me for a ride that one day, and I probably would
[42:47.850 --> 42:51.450]  have told him no, except the place he was asking to go was like a block and a half from where I was
[42:51.450 --> 42:58.650]  headed. And I took a look at him and he looked totally fucked. But like recently, like his clothes
[42:58.650 --> 43:04.490]  were clean, but he looked like he had the worst day after the worst month ever. And I was like,
[43:04.490 --> 43:08.730]  all right, dude, I can give you a ride to where I'm already going. I've like got like 150 pounds
[43:08.730 --> 43:13.770]  on you. Even if you pull like a real fucking loaded weapon on me, I've got this, especially
[43:13.770 --> 43:21.050]  in a car. Like if I can reach you, it's I win. And his little story just wrecked me. Like he had a
[43:21.050 --> 43:29.450]  serious medical condition. Um, he was in Albuquerque and they were like, dude, didn't you hear Pueblo's
[43:29.450 --> 43:35.370]  got it for you. They've got like free services for you with your shit and they'll take real good care
[43:35.370 --> 43:40.490]  of you and the community is going to love you and they'll get you a house and a job and fucking get
[43:40.490 --> 43:46.090]  you on your feet. And this is Pueblo they're talking about. We don't got fuck off for anybody.
[43:46.330 --> 43:53.770]  Um, unless you're looking to invest a couple of million dollars in a new marijuana farm,
[43:53.770 --> 44:00.250]  like Pueblo don't got what you're looking for. Uh, it's cheap to live. And I bet nobody told
[44:00.250 --> 44:04.970]  him that he got the highest unemployment in Colorado. Yeah. We've got the Colorado unemployment
[44:04.970 --> 44:09.610]  rates, like four points. Something it's one of the lower than lowest in the nation, but
[44:09.610 --> 44:15.690]  Pueblo's unemployment rate is like five and a half or six, like a good point and a half higher than
[44:15.690 --> 44:20.410]  the rest of the state. And when you magnify that times, the amount of people that are in the state,
[44:20.410 --> 44:26.970]  like it's a huge, huge chunk of the jobs. Like there's a lot of people that came here looking
[44:26.970 --> 44:32.410]  for work that are just fucking shit out of luck now because they came with no plan, but we're
[44:32.410 --> 44:38.250]  trying to pin it on legal pot when there's like 30 different reasons, homeless people and people
[44:38.250 --> 44:43.690]  about to be homeless. We had a, to Pueblo, you can't rank us the cheapest, like the third cheapest
[44:43.690 --> 44:48.730]  city in the U S and expect that shit not to have consequences, which is in every newspaper in the
[44:48.730 --> 44:53.610]  country. You know what I did not plan poorly. Huh? This dab. Nope. Get it. Let's do this. You guys,
[44:53.610 --> 44:59.450]  I'm going to hit the dab. I'm hitting that fucking hit man. The Samson hit man combo collab rig
[44:59.450 --> 45:04.810]  with a highly educated D nail on it. That runs to the, uh, G nail from emo tech. Shout out to
[45:04.810 --> 45:09.370]  giddy up the shot at the Dougie. I like shout out to task. Let's do this. Keep going, Mike. Keep
[45:09.370 --> 45:16.490]  going. While I dab tell me more about Posada. Oh, Posada is, I don't have anything against Posada,
[45:16.490 --> 45:21.770]  except they're being nuts on this issue. They're getting national press talking about how it's all
[45:21.770 --> 45:25.850]  marijuana's fault. And then if you read the article, you'll get about three quarters of the
[45:25.850 --> 45:31.130]  way through when they mentioned like other cities, bus and homeless people here in straight line to
[45:31.130 --> 45:35.690]  them when they're putting them on the bus, telling them Pueblo is great. And, uh, Pueblo being ranked
[45:35.690 --> 45:42.730]  the cheapest city in the U S um, tons of people moving here. Sure. That three or four of them are
[45:42.730 --> 45:46.490]  going to get jobs in the marijuana industry only to find out that we don't take felons.
[45:49.130 --> 45:56.330]  Uh, I mean, multiple, multiple, they just don't publicize any of the requirements anywhere outside
[45:56.330 --> 46:01.050]  of this podcast basically. Right? Yeah. So that's your public service announcement. You guys make
[46:01.050 --> 46:04.650]  sure you Google that shit. Make sure you can find out if you're even qualified to work in our
[46:04.650 --> 46:09.370]  industry. And if you're going, if you're coming here to run an illegal industry, I'm not even
[46:09.370 --> 46:15.850]  trying to be a smart ass. Uh, I was deep shit into the illegal cannabis industry. I can admit it. Now
[46:15.850 --> 46:20.250]  I can talk about that. You know what? I had to get away from it because it wasn't going to work
[46:20.250 --> 46:25.290]  much longer. I was going to go downhill trying to stay on that side of the world. Now I've got a
[46:25.290 --> 46:29.930]  steady job. Everything is legit. Uh, it's much easier. You guys, it's much easier. And the
[46:30.010 --> 46:34.330]  legal industry is going away. You can see it crumbling here. Those people that are
[46:34.330 --> 46:39.130]  too stubborn to come to the light, you can see them struggling and dwindling and falling off.
[46:40.250 --> 46:45.210]  I saw it a couple of years ago. The people I knew that were living right on the, the edge
[46:46.090 --> 46:50.690]  between the black and the white market, like the, what you'd call the gray market. Um,
[46:52.810 --> 46:57.370]  the more stores that opened up, the harder it was to compete with them. I mean,
[46:58.330 --> 47:05.610]  the guy that had one strain for you in March come July would show up a seven by December.
[47:05.610 --> 47:11.690]  There was a selection of hash in his bag too. Um, and by January it was just too much of a
[47:11.690 --> 47:15.770]  fucking hassle regardless of the selection, because you could just go to a store and pick,
[47:15.770 --> 47:20.970]  right? Like you never had to hang out and not seem like foot traffic or any of that meet somebody
[47:21.050 --> 47:25.450]  somewhere. How much, how many episodes of how it's made would never have been watched
[47:26.970 --> 47:31.530]  if we could just buy weed in stores, deadliest catch would have never been viewed. Yeah. Right.
[47:31.530 --> 47:35.290]  Viewership on a lot of shit would go way down if you didn't have to hang out with your weed dealer
[47:35.290 --> 47:40.890]  for two hours. So you didn't seem like you were there buying weed. Um, this dude's just really,
[47:40.890 --> 47:44.650]  really bored. And a lot of his friends come to visit for two hours at a chunk, I guess. Yeah.
[47:44.650 --> 47:49.610]  We just play Xbox all day. Like it's just so much more convenient even when you get to the shop and
[47:49.610 --> 47:55.450]  you're like, really, that's the price fucking taxes. Like you start wondering how much your
[47:55.450 --> 47:59.690]  time's worth. Like how many hours did I spend sitting on the couch listening to bullshit?
[47:59.690 --> 48:03.690]  Because I was there to buy a bag of weed and that was the best weed in town. Yeah. Cause every weed
[48:03.690 --> 48:09.290]  dealer wants to show you his new thing that he bought with your money that you said, dude,
[48:09.290 --> 48:14.570]  I'm not into ukuleles, but all right, I'll see you. Look at my new didgeridoo man. Anything,
[48:14.570 --> 48:18.170]  but more fucking deadly is catch. Listen to this song. I don't know why I'm kicking that show. I
[48:18.170 --> 48:21.530]  like that. Yeah. I don't know why I used to get stoned and watch the fuck out of some deadly as
[48:21.530 --> 48:25.050]  catch. That's really weird. Hey, it's, it's fun. Wonder which one's going to get squashed by a
[48:25.050 --> 48:29.210]  crab cage next. I'm going to write myself a note here. This is not show related.
[48:31.130 --> 48:35.770]  Watch more deadly as catch. No, I record another podcast and have a deadly as catch
[48:35.770 --> 48:40.410]  story that I want to tell on that podcast. There's an episode where Jeff's in it. People.
[48:40.410 --> 48:45.050]  No, no. I'm kidding. Do you want to tell this weird ass dream story on this podcast? I mean,
[48:45.050 --> 48:49.210]  this show is almost a fucking hour long here. Just read all these people. So let's talk about
[48:49.210 --> 48:52.970]  this. One time I got my wisdom teeth removed and they gave me Vicodin and I took too many of them
[48:52.970 --> 48:56.570]  and I fell asleep watching deadly as catch. Okay. That's like the main setup here.
[48:56.570 --> 49:02.490]  I woke up in a dream that I would caught somebody trying to kill people on the deadliest catch boat.
[49:02.490 --> 49:06.250]  And I murdered him because he was trying to kill me. And in self-defense, I killed the
[49:06.250 --> 49:09.450]  motherfucker because he killed everybody else on the boat. But then I realized everybody on
[49:09.450 --> 49:12.970]  the boat is dead, but me, and they're going to think I did this shit and I'm all covered in
[49:12.970 --> 49:16.490]  blood and the boat's all covered in blood. So I got to get the fuck out of here. And then I wake up.
[49:16.490 --> 49:20.810]  And since I took too many Vicodin before I fell asleep, when I woke up, I didn't really wake up.
[49:20.810 --> 49:24.090]  I was still dreaming, but I was physically sitting up in real life. But in dream life,
[49:24.090 --> 49:28.010]  I was still in my boat and I saw blood all over my house. And it took me a good,
[49:28.730 --> 49:31.690]  I don't really know, but I'm going to say like three or four minutes of like shaking my head
[49:31.690 --> 49:35.370]  around and walking around my bedroom going, why is there blood everywhere? What the fuck is
[49:35.370 --> 49:40.890]  happening? And then finally the blood faded away and I woke up. Don't do too many Vicodin kids.
[49:40.890 --> 49:44.490]  That's my, that's my fucking theory, but I had my wisdom teeth taken out and they fucking hurt,
[49:44.490 --> 49:49.530]  dude. That shit sucks. Okay. I was kind of listening, but while I was listening, I had a
[49:49.530 --> 49:54.330]  thought. Okay. Let's hear your thoughts. This has been rambly as fuck. So if you're still listening,

[52:43.370 --> 52:46.650]  if you want us to keep it sure as fuck, we'll don't worry, but I'd like you to send us some
[52:46.650 --> 52:50.810]  products. Mike and I will unbox it here on the show. We will review it and we'll talk about it
[52:50.810 --> 52:55.450]  on the show. We'll be honest. Uh, we'll check it out. We'll smoke ash through it. We'll smoke weed
[52:55.450 --> 53:00.330]  through it. We'll, we'll read the instructions. That is the truth. We'll, and we'll let the world
[53:00.330 --> 53:06.090]  know what we think. And then we'll send it back to you. If you want to know how big and wide this
[53:06.090 --> 53:11.210]  audience ranges, you get some really random shit on this show. It could be fun to review, right?
[53:11.210 --> 53:15.050]  That could be neat. Send us your products guys. We're mostly looking for cannabis related stuff,
[53:15.050 --> 53:20.490]  but we'll pretty much review anything you want to send us. That is true. That is true. We like hats
[53:20.490 --> 53:24.010]  and shirts and shit too. Oh, I will definitely. If you've got some pennies that you need worn
[53:24.010 --> 53:28.570]  and seen on Instagram, a shout out to ghost cat glass. This just became the fucking shout out.
[53:29.370 --> 53:34.090]  Sounds like fucking the BET awards over here. Remember I like it when you ramble.

[54:04.970 --> 54:09.210]  Let me apologize about the quality of I read genetics, colorado.com. That is under construction.
[54:09.210 --> 54:13.610]  My friend is a college student. We work on that when he's not in college. Uh, let the man get an
[54:13.610 --> 54:17.450]  education that's first. And when he's not there, he'll come over and we'll work on the website.
[54:17.450 --> 54:20.090]  Go to school, Tony, do your thing. Don't worry about it. We got your back, bro.
[54:20.090 --> 54:24.090]  While we're on it, if you're in a position to hire somebody who needs to work like a couple
[54:24.090 --> 54:27.930]  of weeks a year, hire a college student who needs a little help getting through school.
[54:27.930 --> 54:32.250]  I like it when you ramble. Yep. All right, you guys, I'm gonna wrap up this show. Thanks again
[54:32.250 --> 54:35.770]  to Mike for coming. Thanks to everybody for listening. What the hell just tickled my arm?
[54:35.770 --> 54:38.970]  That's a spider or something. God, that scared the shit out of me as a drug.
[54:38.970 --> 54:43.050]  Like bitch, your buddy is a drug. Not used to that. How does that one reach over there? That
[54:43.050 --> 54:47.690]  was weird. So high. Your body cares about your dreadlocks again. Just tickled. That was strange.
[54:47.690 --> 54:51.930]  Anyway, you guys, uh, we're dabbed the fuck out. I hope you had a lot of fun with us.
[54:51.930 --> 54:55.610]  Hashtag. I like it when you ramble, get your sticker pack. Wasn't that a good idea?
[54:55.610 --> 54:58.650]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence. Thanks again for listening guys. Until next time,
[54:58.650 --> 55:01.210]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[55:25.610 --> 55:27.210]  Your pleasure.
[56:05.750 --> 56:08.750]  Bush, Bush, we never ever give up pleasure.
[56:08.750 --> 56:11.750]  High grade, make it ever quality, we be forever.
[56:11.750 --> 56:13.750]  Say, ma, why create forever?
[56:13.750 --> 56:15.750]  And no, Bush, we never ever create forever.
[56:15.750 --> 56:18.750]  Bush, Bush, we never ever give up pleasure.
[56:18.750 --> 56:21.750]  High grade, make it ever quality, we be forever.
[56:21.750 --> 56:24.750]  Package of weed, flies, cigarettes, ship it overseas.
[56:24.750 --> 56:26.750]  We're mounting revenues, poor people will receive.
[56:26.750 --> 56:29.750]  Why me can't afford to export me weed to delis?
[56:29.750 --> 56:31.750]  Dianese, Los Angeles, Greater Angeles.
[56:31.750 --> 56:37.500]  Send the lost to gunnery, prescribe it to your disease.
[56:37.500 --> 56:39.500]  Down up in the trees and lose the bird and the bees.
[56:39.500 --> 56:42.500]  My coca make your brains leak out and your nose when you sneeze.
[56:42.500 --> 56:44.500]  The weed that make me of them, girl, weak in the knees.
[56:44.500 --> 56:47.500]  The weed that make me high, now when I catch a punish.
[56:47.500 --> 56:53.740]  Plus the weed that make me...
[56:53.740 --> 56:56.740]  Never, no, Bush, we never ever create ever.
[56:56.740 --> 56:59.740]  Bush, Bush, we never ever give up pleasure.
[56:59.740 --> 57:02.740]  High grade, make it ever quality, we be forever.
[57:02.740 --> 57:04.740]  Say, ma, why create forever?
[57:04.740 --> 57:06.740]  And no, Bush, we never ever create ever.
[57:06.740 --> 57:09.740]  Bush, Bush, we never ever give up pleasure.
[57:09.740 --> 57:12.740]  High grade, make it ever quality, we be forever.
[57:12.740 --> 57:15.740]  Throw the weed between the rizzle, make me feel charismatic.
[57:15.740 --> 57:17.740]  I personally recommend it if you have smartie.
[57:17.740 --> 57:20.740]  Give me the cumber, it make me panic, can't I coke a day?
[57:20.740 --> 57:22.740]  Give me all the queen all day, give me all the cope all day.
[57:22.740 --> 57:25.740]  The way I love to weed is like the farmer throw honey pon the.
[57:25.740 --> 57:28.740]  Go back to Sodom and Grave, you'll find the dodger hitter grow pon the.
[57:28.740 --> 57:30.740]  13 half is rope pon the, dodger is a bloke pon the.
[57:30.740 --> 57:34.390]  Dodger man don't know how but the truth is I can't cope pon the.
[57:34.390 --> 57:40.650]  Animals in the hood are late, what in the earth they give?
[57:40.650 --> 57:42.650]  That's the last I hit, city smoke they lock me forever.
[57:42.650 --> 57:47.820]  I know Bush, we never ever create ever.
[57:47.820 --> 57:50.820]  Bush, Bush, we never ever give up pleasure.
[57:50.820 --> 57:53.820]  High grade, make it ever quality, we be forever.
[57:53.820 --> 57:54.820]  Say what?
[57:54.820 --> 57:55.820]  High grade forever.
[57:55.820 --> 57:57.820]  I know Bush, we never ever create ever.
[57:57.820 --> 58:00.820]  I know Bush, Bush, we never ever give up pleasure.
[58:00.820 --> 58:03.820]  High grade, make it ever quality, we be forever.
[58:03.820 --> 58:05.820]  Tell them say high grade forever.
[58:05.820 --> 58:08.820]  I know Bush, we never ever create ever.
[58:08.820 --> 58:09.820]  Yeah, what's up, podcast world?
[58:09.820 --> 58:13.820]  It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you live from the car on Interstate 25.
[58:13.820 --> 58:14.820]  That's right.
[58:14.820 --> 58:16.820]  I just left the Champs trade show.
[58:16.820 --> 58:23.820]  I thought it'd be a good idea to jump on the microphone and do a little bit of recording while it's still fresh in my mind.
[58:23.820 --> 58:26.820]  So today I went to the Champs trade show in Denver.
[58:26.820 --> 58:27.820]  It was a beautiful drive.
[58:27.820 --> 58:30.820]  It takes me about two hours to get up to Denver.
[58:30.820 --> 58:34.820]  It took me about another 20 minutes to find a good parking spot.
[58:34.820 --> 58:36.820]  Anyway, I got a good parking spot.
[58:36.820 --> 58:39.820]  I messaged a good friend of mine who had a pass for me.
[58:39.820 --> 58:42.820]  We met up and he got me a pass for Champs.
[58:42.820 --> 58:44.820]  He gave me a high five and told me to have a good time.
[58:44.820 --> 58:45.820]  He had shit to do.
[58:45.820 --> 58:50.820]  So he sent me on my way and I headed into the Champs trade show.
[58:50.820 --> 58:55.820]  You guys, I am failing you right now because I seriously don't know what Champs stands for.
[58:55.820 --> 58:57.820]  Champs is an acronym for something.
[58:57.820 --> 58:58.820]  I don't know what it means.
[58:58.820 --> 58:59.820]  C-H-A-M-P-S.
[58:59.820 --> 59:08.820]  It means something about glass and trade show because what it was was a trade show based on glass, cannabis.
[59:08.820 --> 59:11.820]  And some of that shit said for tobacco use only.
[59:11.820 --> 59:14.820]  But tobacco and cannabis smoking accessories.
[59:14.820 --> 59:24.820]  I saw so basically it's all your shit that is available at all the head shops that you go to depending on the quality of your head shop.
[59:24.820 --> 59:25.820]  But it was all there.
[59:25.820 --> 59:30.820]  All that plastic shitty Chinese smoking accessory stuff was all there.
[59:30.820 --> 59:33.820]  All the shitty Chinese knockoff glass was there.
[59:33.820 --> 59:37.820]  All of the shitty knockoff nail companies were there.
[59:37.820 --> 59:40.820]  But also some of our good friends were there, you guys.
[59:40.820 --> 59:42.820]  I got to visit the Hitman booth.
[59:42.820 --> 59:49.820]  If I was, man, if I didn't walk away from the Hitman booth today, I was going to spend a lot of money with Hitman.
[59:49.820 --> 59:51.820]  They had two rigs that I was really interested in.
[59:51.820 --> 59:52.820]  They had the mini.
[59:52.820 --> 59:55.820]  They have the new, I forget what they call them.
[59:55.820 --> 59:57.820]  They call them a Sunday stack or something like that.
[59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.820]  It's not the Sunday cup, but it's this little stack thing, the mini stack.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.820]  Holy shit.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820]  They had water in it.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.820]  They let me pull through it.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.820]  That thing felt like it would hit like a champ.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.820]  Unfortunately, you guys, there was no consumption in this venue.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.820]  We were not allowed to smoke any type of cannabis.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.820]  We couldn't dab.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.820]  There was actually somebody pressing out rosin dabs.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.820]  He had a rosin press.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:26.820]  If you know about rosin, it's made by squishing your buds between two heated surfaces using parchment in the middle as a way to catch your hash.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:32.820]  He was pressing out rosin right there for you so you could bring your nugs and get them squished is what they were calling it.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.820]  Some people were taking dabs of that right after they would squish it, although it was frowned upon.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.820]  If you got caught, they would escort you out of the building.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.820]  Anyway, I met up with the Hitman crew.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.820]  I fell in love with a couple of rigs.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.820]  They had a mini sidecar rig with a blue label.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.820]  The blue label was beautiful.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.820]  It's my favorite color, my exact favorite color blue.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:01:01.820]  Unfortunately, I just bought the same rig with a yellow label, so I could not bring myself to spend another $150 on a rig, although $150 on that rig was a steal.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.820]  I just didn't want to buy a copy of a rig that I have already got.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.820]  It did not make sense to me.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.820]  Anyway, so I had to walk away before I bought the Sunday Stack and before I bought the blue mini sidecar.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.820]  They had a bunch of great rigs at the Hitman booth.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:19.820]  Also, I made friends with a bunch of people.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.820]  I also got to bump into our crew with Oil Slick.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.820]  Josh from Oil Slick and the Oil Slick crew was there in full force.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.820]  They sent me home with a sample of the—I forget the official name of it.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.820]  I've been calling it the Bong condom.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:44.820]  It's basically a condom you put on the mouthpiece of your bong so that if you're at a large party or an event, you can swap those out so that not everybody has to get the—we call it the cup cough or the wook flu.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.820]  They gave me a couple of those to check out.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.820]  Right across from our friends at Oil Slick was our good friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.820]  Big shout out to the entire Handmade and Oil Slick family.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.820]  Thanks for coming out to Colorado.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.820]  Thanks for showing everybody how to run a booth at Champs because you guys do it right.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.820]  You guys are great people, great people in the industry, great service.
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:06.820]  So you guys, make sure you support Oil Slick and Handmade Apparel and also Hitman Glass.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:15.820]  Also, I made a little stop at the Highly Educated Titanium little booth there, and I picked up a couple of Highly Educated Titanium products.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.820]  Taskz was not in the building, but he had his cronies working for him.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.820]  They do a great job, so shout out to those guys.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.820]  Make sure you support Highly Educated Titanium.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:30.820]  I know it sounds like a big bunch of shout outs, but I was at an event where there were a bunch of vendors, you guys, so these guys took care of me.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.820]  They're products that I support, so shout out to all of them.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:39.820]  So it's basically, you guys, it's a big swap meet of supplies for your head shop.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:46.820]  I saw every kind of pipe and bong and hash rig and nail you could imagine, every type of hash container you could imagine.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.820]  There was not a lot of growing accessories or gross supplies or anything like that.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:56.820]  It was all basically aimed at supplying your head shop with good quality glass.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.820]  So I've got a list of people here that I got to hang out with today.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.820]  Before I even open up the list, I don't even need to think about it.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:10.820]  As I walked out of my car, I walked up to, no, as soon as I walked into the event, I was greeted by a guy by the name of Scott Reach.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.820]  He walked up to me and shook my hand, asked how I was doing.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.820]  You guys, that is Rare Dankness, one of the most popular seed companies in the world right now.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.820]  For Scott to walk up and know who I was kind of blew my mind, to tell you the truth.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:30.820]  I got a few feet into the building and then I ran into the man himself, the kosher stoner, Adam Macadoshus, our good friend Adam Ill.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.820]  Big shout out to Adam Ill. It was good seeing Adam Ill.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.820]  I got to hang out with Adam for a few minutes, have a quick conversation.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.820]  Adam was hungry, so he took off. We were supposed to link up for Terps later.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.820]  We'll talk more about that. I ended up having to drive home.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:47.820]  I didn't have to drive home. Dinner was at 7. It was 7 o'clock.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:52.820]  We were still at Hunt's house taking dabs. I figured we weren't going to dinner until 7.30, which means I would have been there until 8.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:56.820]  Or no, I would have been there until 9, maybe 9.30. It's a two-hour drive from there.
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.820]  That would have put me home around 11.30 or midnight. I couldn't deal with that.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.820]  I've got to work in the morning, so I had to split out from dinner.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.820]  But anyway, shout out to John Hunt. Shout out to Adam Ill. Shout out to Carly.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:13.820]  Big shout out to everybody who invited me to dinner. I apologize for not being able to make it next time, guys, for sure.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.820]  I went to Champs today on a whim. I wasn't even supposed to go to Champs.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:20.820]  This was a poorly planned trip, but I'm going to call it a hell of a success, you guys.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:28.820]  So I was walking through Champs, and I spied one of the most beautiful women I have ever laid my eyes upon.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:39.820]  The lovely Miss Charlotte Green was in the building. If you guys don't know who Charlotte Green is, she is a cannabis activist from Alaska.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.820]  And she's actually the lady who is known for saying, fuck it, I quit on the news.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:50.820]  She was at Champs. She was here in Denver. Oh my gosh, you guys. Usually, I am cool, calm, and collected.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.820]  I am a smooth motherfucker. I'm not afraid to talk to anybody. I'll walk up to anybody and say hello.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:01.820]  I'll walk into the restricted access area and act like I own that shit. I'm not a shy guy.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.820]  But for some reason, when I saw Miss Charlotte Green, something inside of me fucking melted.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:17.820]  You guys, Charlotte is more beautiful in person than she has ever looked online, on Facebook, on the internet, on Twitter, on Instagram, whatever you saw her on.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.820]  She is even more beautiful in person, and her personality is sassy and stunning.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:29.820]  So I'm walking toward her, and she spotted me, and she reached out and put her hand on my shoulder and said, hey, you.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.820]  And she knew who I was, which was kind of weird.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.820]  I've stalked her on Facebook and said hello, but she has no reason to know who Rasta Jeff is.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.820]  So I was a little excited by that. That made me a little spellbound. It made me feel like a high school boy.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:45.820]  So I stopped, and I asked her if I could give her a hug, and she said, oh, of course.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.820]  And we talked for a couple of minutes, and you guys, I went stupid.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.820]  I did not have shit proper to say to that beautiful lady.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:06:00.820]  I couldn't decide if I wanted to just be like a normal dude and talk to her, or if I wanted to go into like business guy mode, or if I wanted to be podcast guy.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.820]  My brain fluttered. That woman is beautiful. Oh, my God.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.820]  So big shout out to Charlo Greene if you listen to this. Yes, I'm gushing over you.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:13.820]  You're the most beautiful damn woman I have seen in a long time. Holy shit. Blew my mind, honey.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.820]  She's tall, you guys. I'm 6'5". Of course, she was wearing some heels, but she is tall.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.820]  Hold on. There's a cop right next to me. He might pull me over.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.820]  Yes, I am talking into a microphone while driving down the interstate.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.820]  This cop is right next to me, you guys. He's like staring at me. He's like, what are you doing?
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.820]  Oh, he didn't pull me over. That was awesome.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:35.820]  Okay. Anyway, Charlo Greene. I'm 6'5". Charlo Greene, of course, was wearing some heels, but she was nearly as tall as me.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.820]  I posted a selfie to Instagram, and you guys will be able to see if you check that out.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.820]  Check it out. It's at I read genetics on Instagram.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.820]  She is tall, and I said, damn, honey, you are tall.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.820]  And I put my arm around her. We took a selfie, and she goes, I'm a big girl, and I love it.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:50.820]  And I said, me too. And I went silent.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.820]  I was like, well, I've got a shop down in Pueblo. You should come check that out.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.820]  And if I see you at the party later tonight, we'll dab.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.820]  And of course, I'm not going to the party because I do have to work in the morning.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.820]  I was really thinking about going to the party, but I can't. It'll kill me.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.820]  I will hate life tomorrow, and I've got to be a productive dude.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.820]  I've got shit to handle. Trying to be a grown ass man.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:13.820]  So let's see. I've got a list of people that I wanted to make sure I gave a shout out to.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.820]  We covered Hunt. Hunt, John Hunt, you're a bad motherfucker.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:21.820]  You are the Terp Gatherer. You are, man, you're the brother, dude. You're the man. I like it.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.820]  Big shout out. Much respect to John Hunt, the Grammy Gatsby.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:29.820]  That's my boy. That's my partner in crime. I like hanging out with that dude.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.820]  He kind of encouraged me to come up to Champs. He let me hang out.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.820]  He kind of encouraged me. He kind of made it happen. It's your fault.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.820]  He let me hang out at the house afterward and stop and take some dabs at the Terp Station.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.820]  Thanks for letting me come to the dojo, bro. I appreciate it. Shout out to Hunt.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.820]  Also, shout out to Adam Ill. If you guys don't know Adam Ill, you've got to learn about Adam Ill.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.820]  Adam Ill, he had a podcast. I don't think he's doing that.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.820]  He's now working with Be Real on Be Real TV. So Adam Ill, the guy that goes, what?
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.820]  Make sure you check him out. He's cool. That's my homie. Shout out to Adam Ill.
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.820]  Terp Champ. Who else do we got on the list? I am driving, you guys.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.820]  We got Hitman. We got Oil Slick. We got Handmade Apparel.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:10.820]  We got Highly Educated Titanium. We gave a big shout out to Charlo Green.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.820]  God, I just want to take a second to think about that one. Shout out, Charlo.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:19.820]  All right. Also, big shout out to Tim and Zach and the entire crew from New Mexico, you guys.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.820]  My friend Tim is from New Mexico. He's part of the New Mexico medical marijuana movement.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.820]  My friend Zach is a patient. Today I met their grower and another one of their friends.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.820]  I can't remember both of their names. One dude was named Cedar. The other guy, his name has left my head.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.820]  It was a normal guy name. I want to say possibly Tyler.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.820]  But it's been a while, and I've taken a few dabs. His name has left my head. I apologize. It's fucking rude.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.820]  But shout out to those guys. They were a lot of fun to hang out with.
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.820]  They got me into the event. We got to hang out for a little bit.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.820]  I will probably see them on their way home because I live between Denver and New Mexico.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.820]  So stop in and take some dabs, you guys. I can't wait.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.820]  Let's see. Dude, I bumped into a young man by the name of Tim Martin.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.820]  Tim Martin is the host of the John Doe Radio Show.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:05.820]  If you don't listen to the JDR John Doe Radio Show, give that a listen.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:09.820]  Yes, I am shouting out another cannabis podcast, but we are not competing. We are friends.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.820]  We do totally different shows. They're from Denver. I'm from Pueblo. We have different views on things.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.820]  We agree on a lot of things, but I'm just saying it's two totally different shows.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.820]  So there's no competition. I fully support what Tim Martin is doing.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:24.820]  Tim Martin is a great dude. Tim and I actually talked about doing a couple of shows together.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.820]  So in the very near future, I will be traveling back to Denver.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:31.820]  I will be on the John Doe Radio Show. Stay tuned for that. I'll let you know when it happens.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:36.820]  You can listen. Also, we will get Tim Martin to come be on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:40.820]  You guys, now that I've got the Zoom H6, I feel like I can take the show anywhere.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:47.820]  I did not record anything today. It felt rude. I didn't even think about taking my gear in there because it felt rude walking around.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.820]  I just wanted to say hi to my friends and hang out and not be that interview guy.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:56.820]  In the future, I will do that. If there's a two-day event, I'll walk around one day and be friendly.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.820]  I'll walk around the next day with a microphone. It was more fun just catching up with the crew this time, you guys.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:05.820]  So big shout out to Tim Martin. Make sure you guys support John Doe Radio.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.820]  I don't know where to tell you to go look for that. It's probably on iTunes.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:15.820]  The conversation that him and I had today leads me to believe that his podcast is on iTunes.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:20.820]  Who else do we owe a shout out to? You guys, I bumped into a glassblower.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.820]  He's my friend. He's from North Carolina. He now resides in the great city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:30.820]  He's a glassblower that is on the rise. On Instagram, he is known as at Barefoot Glass.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.820]  His name is Will. He's a great dude. Make sure you support that guy.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:36.820]  I am going to get him and his friend Blake on the podcast.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.820]  We are going to talk about glassblowing, the glassblowing industry.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.820]  I plan on having that dude on the show. That is going to be great.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.820]  So big shout out to my buddy Will at Barefoot Glass for hanging out with me, entertaining me for a few minutes at the event.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.820]  That was a good time. Always good to see Will. What up, Will? I hope you listen, bro. Shout out.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:55.820]  Shout out to your bro that I met also. I want to remember that his name was Blake.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.820]  But like I said earlier, that was several hours and several dabs ago.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.820]  I'm trying to get you guys my review of Champs. Well, it's a little bit fresh in my head.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.820]  And it's also filled with shout outs. One more important shout out.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:13.820]  I was walking through the event and I came across a young man who calls himself Fox Extracts.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.820]  What up, Fox? I hope you listen to the podcast. It was great meeting you and your lovely girlfriend and your puppy.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.820]  Big scratch to the puppy on their tummy. Scratch that dog.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.820]  Fox has a lot of great shit coming up with CBD, you guys.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.820]  We talked about something for about a minute and it had me completely intrigued.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.820]  Fox is now in Colorado. He's in Colorado Springs one time this week.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:39.820]  And I am going to do my best to link up with him and get him to talk into a microphone for you and share you some ideas that he's got.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:43.820]  He's got some amazing shit happening. I cannot wait for you guys to get to hear it.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:46.820]  So I think that's all of the shout outs I've got.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:54.820]  A guy gave me an edible to try, but I'm not going to do a shout out on that or any review until I'm able to sit down and look at the packaging and eat it.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.820]  Right now I'm driving on Interstate 25 going about 70 miles an hour.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.820]  There's nobody else out on the interstate. It's just me.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.820]  It's a Wednesday night. It's pretty mellow. I'm actually driving through Monument right now.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.820]  Shout out to the city of Monument.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.820]  And shout out to that cop that didn't pull me over a few miles back.
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.820]  I'm full on talking into a microphone and that cop did not pull me over. That's pretty killer.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:17.820]  So let's see. I think I've done all these shout outs.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.820]  I apologize if I missed anybody. It's nothing personal.
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.820]  Big shout out to Adam Hand for throwing me a pin.
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:28.820]  Big shout out to everybody that I hung out with today. I apologize if I skipped you.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.820]  I want to move on to this next part.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.820]  You guys, I was gifted from a vendor a G-Pen mini disposable.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.820]  It's called the G-Pen disposable vaporizer.
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.820]  It's got a battery already in it.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:44.820]  You're supposed to use it until it dies and then you're supposed to throw it away.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.820]  So it's got instructions of press the button five times to turn it on.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:55.820]  Unscrew the mouthpiece. Load with your desired, I think it said essential oil is what it said on the packaging.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.820]  And then it said screw on the cap and then it said press the button and inhale.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.820]  So I was gifted this. It's a yellow G-Pen disposable.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.820]  It's the concentrate version.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.820]  I have followed the instructions. I unscrewed. I loaded.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.820]  I turned it on. I screwed it back together.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.820]  Now you guys, we are going to press the button and we're going to inhale.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:18.820]  And we're going to see what kind of draws we get off of the G-Pen disposable.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.820]  Let's check it out right now. Here we go.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:41.830]  So it's dead silent. I know it's shitty for podcasting, but I loaded it with New York City diesel live resin that I got from Spence from the Garden of Wheaton.
[01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:42.830]  Big shout out to Spence.
[01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.830]  And it tastes really good, but honestly, I didn't get a bit of smoke.
[01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:48.830]  It's lighting up like it should. Let's try this again.
[01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:49.830]  Let's give it another pull.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:06.740]  So honestly, I just got some hash in my mouth, which tastes really good, but there's no smoke.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.740]  And it's not working the way that you would really expect a hash pen to work.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:15.740]  I packed it down properly. It comes with a little poker so you can...
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.740]  Oh, I got live resin in my mouth.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.740]  It came with a little poker so that you could pack it down in there.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.740]  And it's packed down in there. It's pressed against the coil.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.740]  I've used plenty of hash pens in my day.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:29.740]  And this one so far, two hits in, I'm ready to throw it out the fucking window.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:34.740]  If I hadn't loaded it up with some decent New York City live resin, it would be out the window of the car by now.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:40.740]  So what I'm going to do, I'm going to hold it upright to where the hash will melt into the coil when I press the button.
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.740]  And I'm going to let it melt for a couple of seconds.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.740]  I'm doing that. It's lit up. It seems to be doing its thing.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.740]  So now I'm hoping that I've melted the hash down gravity-wise into the coil.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:56.740]  And I'm going to hold it to where the hash is melting into the coil while I hit it.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.740]  And I'm going to give it a third try.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:00.740]  And we're going to see how this goes.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.740]  So excuse me for one second. You'll get more silence.
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.740]  But I'm going to try this. Hopefully we don't end up with hash down my throat while I'm driving.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.720]  No smoke and a little more hash in my mouth.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.720]  So we will try this again on an episode at home when we're in the house to where we're not driving in the car trying to do this.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:34.720]  But so far the disposable G-Pin, I find it to be a fail.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.720]  I think you press it five times to turn it off.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.720]  Let's see. One, two, three, four, five.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.720]  It flashed and went off.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.720]  I'm going to set that in the seat next to me, next to the microphone case.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.720]  And we're going to say fail on that for now.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.720]  You guys, I've got to take a quick drink because I have a bunch of chunks of wax stuck in my teeth.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.720]  I've got a live resident in my mouth.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720]  So we've been going for a few minutes. Give me just one second.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.720]  I'm going to set down the microphone. I'll edit this out.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.720]  But I need to take a drink. Hold on.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.720]  Because of that pin, I've got melted wax in my teeth.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.720]  Hold on. Here we go.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:17.580]  All right. I might edit a few seconds of that out.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.580]  I apologize, guys. I had to take a drink.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.580]  There's nothing like having hash smeared across your two front teeth.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.580]  That was weird.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580]  All right. So where was I?
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.580]  I was talking about the Champs Trade Show, right?
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.580]  You guys, Champs Trade Show was at the Denver Convention Center.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.580]  It was free.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:39.580]  They make it seem like you need to be some sort of a vendor or have some sort of a license to get in there.
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.580]  But honestly, I don't have – well, I do. I have an LLC and shit.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.580]  But I walked up and said, hey, I'm here.
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.580]  And they said, what company are you with?
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.580]  And I said, I was with my buddy Tim.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.580]  And he didn't even say anything.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.580]  I said, I'm with Organica.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.580]  And they looked at Tim, and Tim's with Organica.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.580]  And so they said, what's your name?
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.580]  And I said, Rasta Jeff.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.580]  And she wrote my name on a little tag and handed it to me.
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.580]  It didn't cost me anything.
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.580]  Champs is a free event if you're in the industry.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.580]  If not, all you got to do is have a good reason to be there and tell them that that's why you're there.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.580]  If you have like a wholesale license or something like that, you can definitely get in.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.580]  If not, you've got a friend that has a way to get you into Champs if you want to go.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:23.580]  It's free, which is a good thing because it's not really worth a whole bunch of money to walk through there.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.580]  If it was like a $5 ticket, I wouldn't complain.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.580]  It was a cool event.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.580]  There's nowhere to sit down.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580]  It's illegal to consume cannabis in the building.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.580]  You can't even hit a vape pen.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.580]  They did not like that.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.580]  Of course, like I said, there were a couple of people taking a couple of razz and dabs.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.580]  But they would have been escorted out had they been caught.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.580]  It was a great event.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.580]  It was fun.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.580]  I had a good time.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.580]  The best part for me, honestly, was linking up with a bunch of people from the industry.
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.580]  What up, Anthony?
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.580]  What up, Johnny B?
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:53.580]  Sorry, I forgot you guys.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.580]  I did not mean to skip you.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.580]  I apologize.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580]  It was just a good conversation.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.580]  It was not something that had to be documented.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.580]  It was just a good conversation, which I love.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.580]  Shout out to also Jonathan.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.580]  Yeah, Jonathan, dude.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.580]  And Dan.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.580]  That's who was with John.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.580]  A whole bunch of people saw me.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.580]  I saw them.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.580]  It was fun hanging out.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.580]  That was my favorite part was meeting up with people and shaking hands and seeing everybody.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.580]  It was a really, really good time.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.580]  It's a great place to go if you're in the industry and you know a few people.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.580]  You can buy a lot of great glass at very great discounted prices.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.580]  I saw some beautiful, beautiful glass.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.580]  But you guys, honestly, I'm not into buying really artful glass lately.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.580]  I've been buying what they call production work and functional glass that's just clear and hits like a champ.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.580]  I hate it when I spend hundreds to $1,000 on a nice rig.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.580]  Hold on.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.580]  I've got to put the microphone down.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.580]  Here goes a car.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.580]  Just give me one second.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.580]  All right.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.580]  I just didn't want that car to see me talking into the mic.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.580]  I hate it when you spend a lot of money or your friends spend a lot of money on a rig and you're like,
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.580]  I'm going to buy a car.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.580]  I'm going to buy a car.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.580]  I'm going to buy a car.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.580]  But with clear, your friends spend a lot of money on a rig and you
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.580]  can only put like a really
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.580]  certain amount of water in there because one drop
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.580]  more it splashes in your mouth and one drop
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.580]  less it doesn't perk right.
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.580]  I find that to be really annoying on a custom-made piece.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.580]  So I buy production pieces that are
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.580]  clear and I think they hit like a
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580]  fucking champ, you guys.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.580]  I think there's nothing wrong with having a clear rig.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.580]  You don't even need to spend a lot of money on a rig.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.580]  You guys, you could have spent 40 bucks on a really nice rig today
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.580]  and been set up.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.580]  You could have got a highly educated titanium nail and a carb cap
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.780]  really good price.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.560]  Champs is a great place if you're looking to come up
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.940]  on a rig or two.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.300]  Or if you've got a wholesale license,
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.020]  it was really the place to buy a whole bunch of shit.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.700]  All right, so also shout out to Grassroots.
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.920]  Grassroots was there, set up in style.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.180]  Yeah, so for a free event, it was really a good time.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.460]  It was a great day in Denver, it rained a little bit,
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.460]  but that didn't slow anybody down.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:47.180]  Most of the vendors that I really appreciated seeing
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.260]  will be at the Cannabis Cup in Denver or,
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.900]  excuse me, I'm burping.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.800]  They'll be at the Cannabis Cup in Denver in April,
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:54.640]  if that happens.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.180]  There's rumors that that may not happen.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.900]  I'm not gonna start talking shit about it on the show,
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.820]  but there have been rumors that that won't happen.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.160]  Let's hope that it does.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.620]  Most of those vendors will be available and present
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.620]  at the Cannabis Cup in full force.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.400]  If there's a Cannabis Cup in your area,
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.900]  I bet those vendors will be there.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.900]  Make sure you look out for Oil Slick.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.000]  Get an Oil Slick pad,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.120]  keep your table from getting all fucking sticky.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.780]  Check out Hitman Glass.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.380]  Hitman makes really good glass that hits like a truck
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.740]  every fucking time.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.180]  When you get new glass, what do you need?
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.020]  You need a new nail.
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.420]  Who do you go for for that?
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.300]  You go to Highly Educated Titanium.
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.540]  You get yourself a nail.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.340]  I like a domeless nail and a carb cap.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.440]  I think that's the way to go.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.180]  Then you need some cool ass T-shirts.
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.900]  Who do you get your T-shirts printed through?
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.540]  You go to Handmade Apparel.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.780]  There's another car on the highway.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.860]  Let's just get behind them and cruise for a little while
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.860]  so they don't see me talking into a microphone.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.500]  Yeah, guys, I am driving on the interstate.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.060]  We're now approaching Woodman Road
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.860]  in the beautiful city of Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.580]  Let's see, I've been recording for 22 minutes.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.000]  I should pay attention more to the road than the recording,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.140]  but I'm the only one out here
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.900]  other than this guy in front of me.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.860]  I'm gonna get passed by a truck.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:58.700]  Here we go.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.340]  All right.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.900]  So yeah, I've got a bunch of great shit planned
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:09.740]  for more episodes, you guys.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.540]  I'm just gonna put this out as a Thursday episode
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.100]  or a bonus Thursday episode.
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.660]  This will not be your Monday primary episode.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.140]  I just wanted to ramble for a little bit
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:17.980]  while I was driving,
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.460]  see if I could actually do a car podcast.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.260]  Never thought of that before.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.660]  Now that I've got this nice gear,
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.380]  I felt it would be necessary.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.420]  You guys, I've got an episode coming up Monday.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:32.260]  I think Monday we are going to talk about ways,
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.620]  reasons why your cannabis is not top shelf
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.420]  and ways that you can improve your cannabis
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.420]  and make it top shelf.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.220]  Wouldn't take a whole lot for most of you guys
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.260]  just to upgrade your grow just a little bit.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:43.220]  It won't cost you money.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.980]  It will cost you more time, energy, effort, and attention,
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:47.940]  which we all should have.
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:50.660]  I've got an episode about CBD planned.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.460]  I think I have an episode with Fox planned.
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.260]  I have an episode about blowing glass
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:57.900]  and the glass industry coming up with our friend Will.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:59.820]  And I am going to try to get a whole bunch
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.580]  of grow lessons planned out.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.060]  I've got some great shit in my mind.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.580]  You guys are gonna love it.
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.980]  I wanna thank you guys for listening
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.780]  to this short car episode.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.100]  I'm gonna get off the microphone.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.340]  I don't have anything else left to say.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.420]  I appreciate you guys.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:15.020]  I love you guys every day like my own adopted children.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.460]  I will be back Monday with the full episode.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.300]  Don't judge me by the quality of this episode.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.020]  I'm gonna be back with the full episode.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.860]  I love you guys.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.900]  I recorded this in the car while driving
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.980]  after the Champs trade show in Denver.
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:29.100]  So until next time, take a fat dab
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:43.640]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.680]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.280]  It's time for episode number 104
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.080]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.080]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.400]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.960]  if you're a professional grower,
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.280]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.720]  if you're a cannabis activist
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.960]  or you're in the state of cannabis,
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.840]  this my friend is the podcast for you.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.800]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.840]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.320]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.480]  to the Mystic Roots band
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.440]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.960]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.400]  I'm back in the studio, you guys,
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.800]  and I'm putting this episode out
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.360]  as a regular Monday episode.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.000]  So good morning, hope you're having a great Monday.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.520]  Sometimes Mondays can be a real bitch,
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.280]  so I hope I make it a little bit better
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.480]  with a fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.720]  If it's not Monday for you,
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.760]  whenever you're listening to this,
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.480]  I hope you're having a great day.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.000]  I hope you've got a fat joint rolled,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.320]  I hope you got a blunt rolled,
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.440]  I hope you got a dab ready,
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.600]  I hope you got a bowl packed,
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.720]  I hope you got the vaporizer filled up.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.840]  I hope you got something going on,
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.400]  maybe you're eating some edibles,
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.440]  maybe you're using some cannabis lubrication
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.280]  or possibly a cannabis suppository, whatever it is,
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.520]  I hope it's working great for you.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.600]  I hope you're working in the garden,
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.120]  I hope you're driving in the car.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.240]  Whatever you're doing, I'm hoping
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.400]  that I'm making your day a little bit better.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.640]  Thanks for joining me, you guys.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.400]  I'm back in the studio.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.000]  Last time I was on, I did an episode from the car
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.760]  and I did a review on the G-Pen Slim disposable vaporizer.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.760]  I used the concentrate version.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.520]  You know, when I was in the car,
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.000]  I gave this thing kind of a shitty review,
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.500]  but let me tell you, that was a preemptive strike.
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.400]  I got home and I looked at it a little bit.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.040]  All I had to do was pack the hash in a little bit harder,
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.900]  press it down and heat it up a little bit,
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.520]  and it actually gave me quite a few fat rips.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.440]  So I'm going to, what is it called,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.440]  withdraw my shitty review of this product
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.840]  and I'm going to update it.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.040]  I'm going to give it like four out of five stars.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.560]  For a vape pen that's disposable,
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.840]  this is probably the best quality we're gonna find.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.280]  So like four out of five stars,
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.360]  because for a dab or a wax hit or a concentrate hit,
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.280]  I prefer a rig.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.000]  You need a rig for five stars, but it's a good product.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.800]  If you're in Colorado and you're picking up some concentrates
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.560]  and you need something to smoke it through,
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.160]  these little yellow vape pens
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.920]  that you're going to throw away when you're done,
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.440]  I think these are an affordable and economical deal.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.760]  So I apologize for the shitty review.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.480]  My updated review says it's a quality product.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.520]  All right.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.720]  So I want to give the whole nation a shout out.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.920]  Everybody in America, this is for you, you guys.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.560]  Halloween just passed and guess how many people reported
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.280]  finding cannabis laced candy
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.600]  in their children's Halloween basket?
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.440]  Nobody.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.160]  That's right, there were zero reports
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.840]  of cannabis laced candy given out for Halloween this year.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.880]  So a big shout out.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.600]  We did the same shout out last year,
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.600]  but I wanted to do it again
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.880]  because you're doing a good job.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.320]  You guys, please don't ever give children, animals,
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.520]  anybody cannabis infused candy without their knowledge.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.440]  If your pet's using it for medicine,
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.360]  do that with discretion.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.280]  I can't judge you there.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.120]  They do make medicine for your dog now.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120]  It's infused with cannabis,
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.000]  but don't do it just to get your dog fucked up.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:44.840]  That's rude.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.120]  You guys keep us on a good streak.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.000]  Keep the recreational cannabis going well for us.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.200]  All right, so shout out.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.960]  So you guys, I was at the Champs Trade Show.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.080]  If you listened to the other episode,
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.440]  I'm sure you heard about that.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.840]  But I was at the Champs Trade Show over the weekend,
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.520]  or it was actually during the week.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.200]  And I noticed something.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.880]  There is a really tight knit,
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.440]  really close little community
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:09.520]  that travels around to all of the cannabis shows
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.640]  and they set up their booths
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.320]  and they take great care of the customers and the community.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.400]  And they really represent the cannabis movement,
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.000]  the cannabis product movement,
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.720]  the cannabis industry in a positive light.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.240]  And I just wanna give a big shout out to all those people.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.160]  They know who they are.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.240]  I don't need to point them out specifically.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.040]  If you were part of that cannabis movement
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.040]  that comes to the events,
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.500]  that goes to the events,
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.240]  that is part of the product development,
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.360]  the advancement of the products,
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.600]  if you're there, show on your face.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.480]  If we see each other and high five each other
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.520]  and don't even have to talk,
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.320]  you're part of the crew that I'm talking about.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.320]  If we see each other and just nod at each other,
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.040]  because we've seen each other so many times,
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.140]  you're part of the crew I'm talking about.
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.740]  You guys make these events happen.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.300]  And we kind of rely on you.
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.020]  I've noticed that I find myself hovering and lingering
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.220]  at those booths that you're there all the time,
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.620]  because we've become comfortable, we've become friends.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.980]  And you guys are also leaders
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.420]  and you're teaching the other booths
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:03.900]  and the other vendors how to do it.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.740]  So big shout out, much respect to the family
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.040]  that travels around and does all of the events
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.860]  and supports each other, supports the movement.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.180]  It's really great to see you guys every time you show up.
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.820]  You're welcome in Colorado all the time.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:17.860]  If you ever need anything when you're in Colorado,
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:19.380]  let me know and I will do my best
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.860]  to accommodate you fully.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.120]  Much love and respect to the whole cannabis community
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.460]  and industry.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:25.980]  And also big shout out to all the people that come
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:29.060]  and learn and meet me and greet me and shake my hand
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.280]  and high five me and ask me questions
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.220]  and thank me for my breeding.
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.260]  Big shout out to all those people.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.180]  I really enjoy going to those events.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.740]  It's really a refreshing time.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.860]  All right, so you guys, let's get down to business.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.700]  Here is the topic for the show today.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.820]  I've been bumping into people
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:47.100]  and they've been talking about why some people
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.380]  are able to take their cannabis to the next level
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:52.840]  and some people are stuck growing.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.020]  It's not mid-grade, but it's still not stellar cannabis.
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.700]  So I thought that I would write down some of the reasons
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:01.560]  why your herb, not yours, but some herb
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.020]  is not what we would consider top shelf product.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.060]  And then we can talk about a few ways on how to improve that
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.100]  and get your herb up to the top shelf.
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:12.020]  So let me work on my list here.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.580]  I got a couple of things written down.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.700]  All right, you guys, the main reason I find
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.660]  that cannabis is not able to be considered
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.500]  top shelf product is because it has been over fertilized.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.580]  A lot of people are thinking that they can add more
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.220]  fertilizer and feed it more
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.620]  and you're gonna get better product.
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:29.860]  But actually what you're doing is you are pumping it full
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.980]  of nutrients that are gonna affect the flavor.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.580]  It's gonna be harder to flush that stuff out in the end.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.020]  Everything that you put into your plants
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:38.340]  will affect the flavor.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.880]  Another big reason that I find a lot of cannabis
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.940]  is not able to be considered top shelf product
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.520]  is that it was not properly flushed.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.960]  Your cannabis plants need to be flushed
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.200]  for a minimum of 10 days,
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.200]  preferably two full weeks before harvest.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.600]  So 10 to 14 days before you plan
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.860]  on cutting down your plants,
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.860]  you need to start watering it with just clean water,
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.520]  pH at about six, five,
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.460]  get in there and just fill every pot,
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.880]  fill the whole pot with water
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.260]  so that it's dripping out of the drain holes a little bit.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:11.720]  Do that 14 days before harvest and then let it dry up
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.760]  just like it normally would.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:13.940]  And when you're gonna water again,
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:16.180]  make sure you water it until it drips out of the pot
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.020]  a little bit.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.900]  And you don't wanna give it any nutrients
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.740]  for the last 14 days.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.940]  If you're an experienced grower,
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.100]  there are a few things you can add at the end there,
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.900]  but I wouldn't recommend too many things
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.220]  unless you really know what you're doing.
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:29.860]  This is where you're really going to start
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.380]  affecting your flavor.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.860]  So be careful at the end,
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:36.060]  make sure you flush for at least 14 days.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.380]  You can go longer.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.860]  I don't think you can over flush.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.140]  If you feel like you start flushing about 14 days
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.720]  before you think you're gonna harvest
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.120]  and you feel like those plants can go a few more days,
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.860]  don't worry, let them go a few more days.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.160]  They'll be just fine and they will taste even better.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.280]  Let them finish up, let them ripen up,
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.120]  let them flush out,
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.320]  let all the nutrients come out and you'll be okay.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.680]  Now you guys, you may see some yellowing.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.720]  Hope for some yellowing.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.160]  That means you're flushing it properly.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.740]  That means that you're getting all the excess nutrients
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:04.640]  out of the leaves that are stored in the plants
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.320]  and you're gonna flush that right on out.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.120]  That means that there aren't extra nutrients left
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:09.520]  in the soil that the plant's eating.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.360]  It means it's eaten all of its food
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.340]  and it's getting cleaned up
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.560]  and it's almost time for harvest.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.120]  Now, I wanna take a step back and say over fertilization
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.800]  and not flushing are both possible.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.120]  Even when you are using organics, you guys,
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:26.200]  organic nutrients can still burn your plants.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.320]  Organic nutrients can over fertilize your plants.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.360]  Be careful when using organics.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:32.540]  You can add the wrong,
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.380]  I mean, think about the way that stuff smells.
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:35.780]  When you're working with some organics,
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.280]  it literally smells like a pile of shit.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.640]  If you over fertilize it,
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.520]  they can make your buds taste like a pile of shit.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.160]  It is very possible.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.960]  Also, not flushing.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.920]  I hear a lot of people say they don't have to flush
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.440]  because they used organic nutrients.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.640]  You need to flush.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.800]  If you're using your own like super soil
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.360]  and you know that you don't need to flush
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.600]  because you've been flushing the whole time,
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.680]  you're an experienced grower and you understand that.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.120]  But if you're using a bottled nutrient
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.960]  or some sort of organics or most amended soils,
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.680]  you're going to need to flush, you guys.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.520]  Make sure you flush even with organics.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.480]  Make sure you don't over fertilize even with organics.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.520]  This can make your cannabis better.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.040]  If you're using a bottled nutrient,
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.840]  start with about half of what they recommend on the bottle,
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.200]  about half of the dosage rate.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.200]  Then if you see that you have a deficiency, move up.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.000]  You can correct, you can always add,
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.200]  but you can never subtract from what you fed your plants.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.160]  All right.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.040]  Don't over fertilize and do flush.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.160]  The next thing that I see
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.480]  that makes cannabis not able to be top shelf
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.800]  is a really poor trim job.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.440]  You would not believe how much very well-grown cannabis
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.960]  I've seen that would have been top shelf
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.280]  if the grower would have taken just a little bit more time
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.040]  to make sure to take all those little tiny leaves off.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.520]  Because we don't want to see any leaves
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.640]  when we're looking at the buds.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.360]  We want to see trichomes, we want to see resin,
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.120]  we want to see just buds.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.880]  We don't even want to see any stick at all.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.480]  Just the little tiny stick that sticks out
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.560]  at the bottom of the bud, that's all that we need.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:07.920]  So when you're trimming,
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.160]  make sure you take off all those little tiny pointy leaves,
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.120]  get in there and clean that shit up.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.280]  Cut all the little sticks out,
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.240]  cut your sticks off of the big gigantic buds
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.920]  and trim your weed to look like just buds.
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.440]  Look at a magazine, look online,
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.160]  look what good quality bud looks like
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.520]  and trim it up like that.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.320]  If you can see an obvious leaf on there,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.400]  get in there with your scissors and clip it off.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.760]  Get in there with your thumbnail and knock that off.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.240]  Trim your weed like connoisseur grade weed
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.160]  and it will be top shelf.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.120]  All right.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.920]  And also wear rubber gloves, you guys.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.880]  When you're trimming your cannabis,
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.600]  make sure that you wear rubber gloves.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.720]  And in my opinion,
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.720]  top shelf herb is hand trimmed and not machine trimmed.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.040]  If you've got machine trimmed bud
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.640]  that won a cannabis cup, I'm impressed.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.600]  Let's see.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.440]  Wear rubber gloves, you guys.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.560]  Whenever you're touching these buds,
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.640]  whenever you're touching a product
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.760]  that somebody's going to smoke,
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.320]  make sure you wear rubber gloves.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.440]  We do not want to smoke your skin oils.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.200]  I don't want to hear your skin oil or your skin moisture
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.600]  sizzle in my dab.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.480]  That's just so gross.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.000]  So trim your weed, wear gloves,
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.560]  and use scissors, not a trim machine
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.360]  is something I want to stress.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.200]  All right.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:14.200]  So another thing that quite often deters people's cannabis
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:19.440]  from being top shelf product is a very poor cure.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.440]  A lot of people are trying to speed dry their cannabis.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.960]  You guys, the slower your buds dry,
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.120]  the better they are going to taste,
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.160]  the better they are going to smoke.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:31.200]  Think about your goal.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.920]  Your goal is to eventually grind up this bud
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.400]  and either roll a joint out of it or pack a bowl
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.800]  or stuff it in your vaporizer.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.040]  Or most of us nowadays are going to stuff it into a tube
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.880]  and turn it into BHO,
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.200]  or a lot of you are going to freeze it
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.000]  and turn it into ice wax or something.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.880]  But anyway, let's think about what we're trying to do.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.640]  Eventually, most of us are going to grind up this herb
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.440]  and roll a fat joint out of it.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.320]  Now, when you smoke your joint, you want it to smell good.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.240]  You want it to taste good.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.480]  You want it to get you nice and stoned.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.080]  But something that you really want it to do
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.080]  that you don't think about
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.800]  is that you want it to burn nice and smoothly.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.600]  You want it to burn evenly.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.160]  You want it to burn and make a nice white ash.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.200]  You don't want it to burn
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.280]  into this hard black charcoal looking thing.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.560]  That hard black charcoal
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.640]  that's in the bottom of your bowl when you're done
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.840]  or that your joint turns into,
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.600]  that's nutrients that weren't flushed out of the plant.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.320]  Anyway, I'm backing up a little bit,
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.000]  but a lot of times a bad cure
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.400]  will make your buds not burn properly.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.920]  When you're curing your buds,
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.680]  you are removing excess chlorophyll from the plants.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.080]  You are removing a water molecule from the THC,
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.880]  which makes the THC more psychoactive.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880]  You are also pulling chlorophyll,
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.400]  which is making the plants taste better,
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.160]  making your buds taste better.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.600]  So a proper cure and not a speed dry is very important.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.200]  A proper cure will definitely affect
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.960]  the way that your buds burn.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:02.680]  Slowly drying your buds will suck out all of that chlorophyll
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.120]  and it will suck the moisture out slowly
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.400]  and your buds will burn very nice and smoothly.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.160]  They'll be nice and sticky
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.000]  and they will burn very, very well.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.560]  I've got an episode all about drying and curing.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.760]  I'm gonna pause right now
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.360]  and go see exactly which number it is.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.800]  It's either 35 or 36.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.720]  Let me pause for one second and go see what it is
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.040]  so that I can tell you to listen.
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:23.880]  Here we go.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.560]  Okay, you guys, it's episode number 35.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.920]  Go listen to episode number 35
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.640]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.880]  and learn all about properly drying
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.320]  and curing your cannabis.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.600]  Actually, when it was episode 35,
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.480]  it was called I Grow Culture,
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.880]  but it's still on the same feed, you guys.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.000]  It's episode number 35
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.440]  and it's titled number 35, Drying and Curing.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.720]  So go check it out.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.680]  It's the formerly known as I Grow Culture podcast,
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.440]  the now known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.720]  It's in the same feed.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.760]  Go check it out.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.920]  I feel like I'm way off topic.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.920]  Let's get back in the game here.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.160]  We are talking about a poor cure
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.920]  is what makes your buds not top shelf
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.200]  because they don't taste good
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.680]  and they do not burn properly.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.400]  You guys, it is very possible to have nice sticky buds
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.800]  that are properly dried and cured
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.360]  that will burn like a champ,
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.400]  stink up the whole fucking neighborhood
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.440]  and get you high as shit.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.280]  That's your goal.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.640]  So listen to the episode,
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.920]  learn how to properly dry and cure the buds.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:21.040]  Another thing, don't try to speed dry your weed, you guys.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.320]  Do not speed dry it.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.720]  Cut it down, hang it upside down
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:25.320]  and let it dry properly.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.920]  That's gonna give you a huge advantage.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.080]  Also, here is a major contributing factor
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.760]  to why I feel like a lot of people's buds
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.400]  are not top shelf.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.720]  You guys, people really love to cut their buds
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.600]  way too early.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.920]  Let that shit grow.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.560]  Let it finish.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.960]  Just because the packaging on your seed package
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.120]  says that those seeds will be done in 60 days
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.160]  does not mean that you have to cut them down in 60 days.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160]  Get yourself a nice scope.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.280]  Get some sort of a scope
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.480]  where you can magnify the size of your trichomes
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:02.040]  to where you can see how many of them have turned opaque,
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.760]  how many of them have gone cloudy,
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.540]  and how many of them are amber.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.280]  When you start seeing about 30% amber trichomes
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.040]  is when it's time to harvest, you guys.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.400]  A lot of people are just cutting weed down way too early.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.040]  They're trimming it like shit.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.880]  They're speed drying it.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.480]  And then they're trying to get top shelf prices for it.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.400]  And they feel bad and they feel let down
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.040]  when they're not able to sell their product
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.160]  for a top shelf price.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:28.040]  You've got to let it finish.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.360]  You've really got to let it finish.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.480]  It doesn't even taste right.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.040]  It doesn't get you high enough.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.400]  And you're not even getting the right weight
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.520]  if you don't let it finish.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.480]  That last week or two is really where it starts
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.400]  packing on weight on a lot of strains.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.720]  So let the weed grow longer.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.640]  Quit cutting it too early.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.200]  And it will really improve the quality of your buds.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.400]  Like I said, get a scope.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.720]  Start watching the trichomes.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.960]  Quit paying so much attention to your calendar
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.200]  and pay a little bit more attention to the plants.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.840]  I understand you're on a schedule,
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.920]  but the plants are the boss here.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.840]  And if you want A plus top shelf buds,
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.840]  this is what you're gonna have to do.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.280]  All right, so don't cut too early.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.200]  Now also, you're going to have to pay
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.920]  a lot more attention to the room.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.000]  We can tell, I can tell by looking at the finished product
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.360]  if the room got too hot or if the room got too humid
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.840]  or if you had some sort of bug infestation
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.800]  or if there was some sort of struggle.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.200]  A professional grower can tell
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.680]  by looking at your finished buds what the problem was.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:25.720]  If your buds are airy and fluffy,
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.600]  you probably got too hot in there.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.800]  If the buds have this weird texture to them,
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.840]  it probably got too humid in there.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.880]  I can spot bug damage on those leaves
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.080]  that you're not cutting off.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:38.440]  I can see the spider mite marks on those leaves, you guys.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.720]  So pay a lot of attention to the room.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.440]  Get good control of your rooms.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.640]  It's all about the environment.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.000]  You have to set up that room to have proper airflow.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.720]  You need air exchange.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.280]  You need to get the old, stale air out of there
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.800]  and you need to get fresh air in
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.240]  so that that plant can breathe.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.200]  You don't want to be trapped
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.480]  in a stale, humid-ass closet all day.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.800]  Neither do your plants.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:02.500]  So, and they also don't want to be too hot.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:05.000]  If you get the plants too hot, they start foxtailing,
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.160]  the buds start getting wispy.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.920]  It's just like in the summertime, you guys.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.040]  You guys, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.920]  When it gets all hot, your junk starts swinging down all low.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.480]  It's just trying to cool itself down.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.280]  The plants will do the same thing.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.040]  It starts spreading its legs all far
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.400]  so that it can get some air and it starts foxtailing.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.640]  That's from too much heat, you guys.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.360]  So if you get your grow room under control,
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:29.160]  you will be able to produce better cannabis.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.720]  Get the bugs under control, you guys.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.220]  If you don't have bugs on your plants,
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.180]  your plants don't have to spend all of their energy
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.880]  fighting off these predators
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.800]  and they're able to use all of their energy
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.720]  into producing delicious, tasty trichomes
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.960]  and resin and terpenes.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.760]  Let the plants focus on what they're supposed to do.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.920]  All right, so pay attention to the room.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.120]  Get the room under control
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.520]  is the point of that part right there.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.760]  So another reason why a lot of cannabis that I see
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.360]  cannot be considered top shelf cannabis
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.440]  is because the grower basically forgot
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.880]  the general rules of growing.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.240]  He forgot to think about his lights, his air,
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.040]  his water, or his soil.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.280]  He just kind of got, sometimes as growers,
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.600]  we get complacent, we get cocky, we get egotistical,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.100]  we get overconfident, we get ahead of ourselves.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.520]  That shit happens.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.640]  And sometimes that's when you start worrying
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:27.560]  about something that is really obscure
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.000]  and then you forget about something that was really basic.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.120]  You're trying some new trick
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.720]  that's really gonna improve the crop, right?
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:35.200]  This new trick is gonna make everything fucking magical.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.700]  It's gonna be amazing.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:40.400]  But as I did that, I forgot to pH the nutrient solution
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.660]  before I watered it.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:43.120]  Something stupid like that, you guys.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.080]  Just pay attention to the basics.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.680]  Pay attention to your lights.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:47.840]  Pay attention to the air.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.320]  Pay attention to your water.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.880]  And pay attention to your soil.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.920]  And everything should be cool.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.640]  Of course, pay attention to the plants.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.840]  Look at the leaves every day for bugs.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.680]  Do all that stuff.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.280]  But remember the basics.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.560]  You need good lighting.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.160]  If you don't have good lighting,
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.520]  you can't grow quality buds.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.900]  You can grow quality bud under a small lamp.
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.600]  I wouldn't go, you know, you can use a 250.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.480]  You're not gonna grow cannabis cup winning buds
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.700]  underneath a 250 watt light.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.460]  You may do okay under a four.
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.240]  You've got potential under a six.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.300]  But I really think if you're gonna grow
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:20.860]  cannabis cup winning, top shelf, A grade buds,
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.340]  you need at least a thousand watt light.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.060]  At least 1,000 watt light.
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:27.420]  And you don't wanna try to put more than about
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:30.580]  a four by four or a five by five floor pattern
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.660]  worth of plants underneath there.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.780]  You want your canopy to be nice and tight
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:35.580]  under that thousand watt light.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.300]  The light is the main nutrient for your plants.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.700]  That's what the plants want more than anything.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.180]  So have enough lighting.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.820]  And also make sure you have the right spectrum.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.980]  That's super important.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.300]  Don't forget about that.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:49.560]  Air, we sort of discussed air before.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.860]  Don't have too much humidity.
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:53.300]  Don't have too much heat.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.500]  Try to find a way to replenish the CO2
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.860]  by replacing the air in the room very often.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.000]  Your water.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.100]  I've mentioned this.
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.340]  Make sure you're pH and your nutrient solution
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.260]  before you're feeding it to your plants.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:07.700]  Make sure you're checking your PPMs.
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:09.700]  Make sure you're using good quality water.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.100]  If you can start with reverse osmosis water,
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:13.780]  that would be ideal.
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:16.300]  Make sure you remember to check the pH, you guys.
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.140]  A lot of people simply have overlooked pH
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:20.940]  balancing their water before they add it
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.580]  to the plants.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.180]  You want that about six, five-ish,
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.700]  depending on what strains you're running.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:27.820]  Depends on how far into flower you are.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.660]  But make sure you've got your nutrients measured properly.
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:31.940]  You're not overfeeding the plants
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.920]  and you've got them pH adjusted.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.600]  Your soil, you guys.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.980]  You gotta use a good quality soil.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:38.660]  You can't be packing your dirt too tight.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.900]  You need some aeration.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.280]  You need some air in there.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.280]  You need some drainage in there.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.400]  Use good soil.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.040]  Don't overlook that type of stuff.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.120]  Those are the basics that you guys need to pay attention to
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.080]  that you may have forgotten, that sometimes I forget.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.860]  I'm guilty of this as well.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:57.160]  This is all small things that I'm trying to remind you about.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.400]  So don't forget the basics of growing.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.960]  And we can always refer to the old rule called laws.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:04.120]  Lights, air, water, and soil.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.840]  Never forget those.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.440]  And then of course you gotta add love in there
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.320]  because I think plants grow with a lot of love.
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.560]  You gotta love the plants.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.840]  Another way to improve your cannabis,
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.240]  and this is gonna sound like I'm just trying
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.640]  to make a sales pitch here,
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.800]  but you need good quality genetics, you guys,
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.000]  unless you've got a top shelf cultivar.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.760]  And I'm gonna branch here.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.120]  You guys, quit saying strands.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.200]  It's not a strand.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.560]  We don't smoke different strands.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.960]  We don't grow different strands.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.940]  We grow different strains.
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.320]  And if you really wanna be difficult and technical,
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.240]  they're known as varietals.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.200]  And then if you really wanna be an asshole,
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.960]  you would call it a cultivar.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.880]  So a specific phenotype of a specific strain
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.520]  would be a cultivar.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.440]  But I digress.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.520]  Use good genetics, you guys.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:50.360]  Grow a good strain.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.400]  If you're stuck on growing that strain
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.800]  and you can't get it to be what you want it to be,
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.840]  maybe it's time to buy a pack of seeds
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.960]  and run those seeds and find the one in there
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.880]  that does what you need.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.160]  Maybe you're simply held back
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.240]  by the quality of the clones you've got.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.760]  That could be your issue.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.920]  So use good genetics.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.260]  Do some research.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.420]  Get some seeds from a reputable breeder.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:13.180]  I am not sponsored by thedankteam.com currently.
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.940]  They do not pay for any ads.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.660]  But I can fully recommend my friends at thedankteam.com.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.620]  They have reliable seeds.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:22.000]  I used to say it all the time.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.140]  You can get Rare Dankness, Mile High, Canaventure,
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:27.980]  Sin City, Sour Seeds.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:29.900]  Those are just a few of the people that I would recommend.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:32.560]  Of course, I read genetics if you can get your hands on it.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.540]  Get yourself some good quality seeds
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.540]  from a reputable breeder.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:37.940]  Do a pheno hunt.
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:40.820]  Find the best one out of there for you.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.940]  And maybe that will help you improve
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.140]  the quality of your cannabis.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:46.260]  Maybe it's just that clone that you're growing
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:47.620]  isn't going to get any better.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:51.460]  Maybe it's got, maybe its potential is only 17% THC
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.700]  no matter what you do to it.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.460]  It's just a genetic thing.
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.220]  My genetics say that I'm not gonna be able
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.820]  to jump six feet high no matter what I do.
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.660]  I can't jump high.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.420]  I'm a white man that can't jump.
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:02.900]  It's just my genetics.
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:05.180]  Sometimes these plants aren't gonna go
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.140]  much further than their potential.
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:09.220]  So get good genetics.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.820]  Now you guys, we talked about lights, air, water, and soil,
[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:14.680]  but what we gotta think about is do not overlook
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.500]  the vegetative stage of growth.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.660]  From day one, when you get those clones,
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.740]  when you crack those seeds,
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:24.020]  from the very beginning of the grow,
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.860]  you are working on the quality of that cannabis.
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.540]  You may just say, hey, it's a veg.
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:31.320]  I can just put it under these weak lights.
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.980]  I don't need a lot of good air.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:35.500]  I don't need to feed it good nutrients.
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:40.340]  But really, good teenagers and good kids make good adults.
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.460]  So why doesn't the same shit work with plants?
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.460]  I think you need to take really good care
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.100]  of those baby plants because that is
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:47.780]  the beginning of everything.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.800]  You need to create a nice root zone.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.860]  You need to create a nice thick stalk.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.780]  You need a nice node structure.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.300]  You need nice, strong, supported branches.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:59.260]  You need nice topping.
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.300]  You need a nice canopy.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:02.940]  You need nice pruning.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.820]  Just take very good care of the plants in the veg phase
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:08.860]  and you will be very prepared for happy, healthy plants
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.760]  when you go into the flowering stage.
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.780]  So pay more attention to the veg phase.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:14.260]  I think a lot of people overlook
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:17.340]  the vegetative stage of cannabis growing.
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:19.820]  So that's a way that you could definitely improve
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.880]  the quality of your cannabis.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.620]  All right, guys, I've got one more thing
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.060]  that I really think would help improve
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.060]  the quality of your finished product.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.180]  And it will also help improve the quality
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:33.020]  of your concentrates if you're a hash maker.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:36.900]  Something you really need to do is clean your grow room.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.380]  Okay, make sure that the floor is clean.
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:41.420]  Make sure that the tops of your light reflectors
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:42.260]  are dusted off.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:44.240]  Make sure that the air conditioner gets cleaned.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.760]  Make sure that all the blowers and the carbon filters,
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:49.020]  the tops of them, sometimes they collect a little dust.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.140]  Clean those.
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:51.940]  Make sure that your carbon filter covers
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.980]  get cleaned occasionally.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:56.620]  Hey guys, you gotta go in there and clean up.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:59.360]  If you've got a shop vac with a good filter on it,
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.600]  get in there and shop vac the corners,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.040]  clean the fuck out of that grow room
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.540]  because every piece of dust and particulate
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:08.640]  that is in the air will end up sticking to your plants.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.200]  If you've ever taken a picture of a cannabis plant
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:13.320]  and there's a little hair in there,
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.120]  you understand exactly how bad anything and everything
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.640]  will stick to your cannabis plants while they're growing.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.280]  You'll never be able to get the hair out of it.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.120]  You'll never be able to get the dust out.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:24.000]  So clean up the grow room.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.640]  If you've got long hair, if you've got a beard,
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.720]  think about keeping that shit out of the plants too.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:29.920]  Do what you can.
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.800]  I can't talk too much shit.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.300]  I've got dreadlocks that go almost to my knees.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:36.080]  I've gotta wear a big ass hat just to go in the grow room.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:39.720]  So try to be sanitary, try to be clean,
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.280]  try to be dust free, try to clean up all that shit.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.800]  All of that stuff is going to stick to your buds.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.760]  All that stuff is going to end up in your finished product.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.960]  All that stuff is going to end up in your concentrate.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.640]  So just think about all the dust
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.260]  and whatever that is that's soil
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:55.900]  and whatever else you're dragging around in the grow room.
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:00.060]  That's all going to end up in your finished product.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:01.700]  All right, you guys, so I'm gonna do a quick recap.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.100]  I've gone through my list.
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:04.020]  Let's go real quickly.
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.500]  If you want your buds to be a little bit better
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:10.080]  than they are, maybe you could pay more attention
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:10.940]  to your feeding.
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.260]  Maybe you could flush a little bit better.
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.940]  You could possibly trim up your buds a little bit better.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.380]  You could probably improve the quality
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.980]  of your drying and curing method,
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:22.620]  which all you'd have to do is listen to episode number 35
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.820]  and that'll give you huge steps on how to do that.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:27.820]  You could probably let your plants grow a little bit longer.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:29.180]  Pay attention to the harvest date.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:30.660]  That would help you out.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:33.300]  You could probably pay more attention to the room
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:34.940]  and dial the room in a little bit better.
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:37.480]  You could probably work on not having bugs.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.060]  Another good way to improve the quality of your cannabis
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.700]  is to remember the basics,
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.940]  remember the fundamentals of growing.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.220]  Another huge way to improve the quality of your grow
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:52.020]  is to use quality genetics from a reputable breeder.
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:55.180]  Another good way is to not overlook your veg phase
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:58.340]  and of course, clean up the grow room.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:00.060]  And then of course, we've got a little side note here
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:01.660]  that says good lighting.
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.760]  So make sure you're using proper lighting
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:05.280]  and also you guys, good nutrients,
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.300]  good quality nutrients will get you a long way.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:09.300]  Make sure your plants are properly fed.
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:12.180]  There are a few things that I think would work
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:13.860]  with every feed regimen.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.860]  If you wanted to add dehydrated coconut water
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:19.160]  and also yucca extract,
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.700]  those things will definitely improve your cannabis
[01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.020]  with almost any feed regimen.
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:24.860]  If you're going hydro,
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:26.320]  you're gonna have to figure out how to add those
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.700]  to your hydro regimen.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:28.680]  It's a little bit different,
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.460]  but if you got a soil mix going on,
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.980]  those things will definitely make your plants taste better.
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:35.060]  If your plants are burning and making black ashes,
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:37.700]  you're probably over-nutrienting, over-nutrienting,
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.380]  over-feeding, over-fertilizing
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:40.720]  is what I think I'm trying to say,
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.020]  and you're not flushing properly.
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:44.120]  So work on those things.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.620]  You guys, that's all I've got for this episode.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:48.420]  I'm gonna start wrapping up the show.
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:50.140]  I will be back in about,
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:51.700]  I'm not gonna do a midweek episode,
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.340]  so I will be back Monday for you.
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:54.760]  I've got a couple of few things planned.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:56.620]  I'm trying to link up with our friend Fox.
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:58.140]  He's in Colorado right now.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.260]  He is a busy man.
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:00.080]  He is elusive.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:01.260]  I've chased him down for a day,
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:02.720]  and it was hard to find him.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:04.700]  So I did not record with him yet,
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:09.500]  but we will in the future if everything goes my way.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.060]  You guys, I'd love it if you found me on the social media.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:12.900]  I am on Twitter.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.960]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:15.980]  We are on Facebook.
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:17.300]  It's Grow From Your Heart.
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.620]  On Instagram, I use the I Read Genetics Instagram page.
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:23.020]  We're almost at 19,000 followers.
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:24.860]  It'd be really cool if you clicked on that
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.160]  and put me up there at 19,000 followers.
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:28.540]  That'd be really cool.
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.460]  So follow I Read Genetics on Instagram.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.740]  You guys, I think that's all I have got for you this week.
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:35.580]  I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:39.220]  I wanna give a big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.220]  Until next time, you guys,
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.700]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.

[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.140]  Yeah, welcome back Cannabis Community.
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:10.140]  It's time for episode number 105 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.140]  God, I'm already coughing through the intro.
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.140]  I want to thank everybody for joining me, you guys.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.140]  Sitting across the table from me is my good buddy, Will.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:18.140]  How you doing, bro?
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.140]  Good, man. How you doing?
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.140]  Dude, I'm doing great. Thanks for joining me.
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.140]  You guys, I apologize for coughing right away on the intro.
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:24.140]  I blew the intro, but it's alright.
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:25.140]  We're going to have a great show.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:27.140]  You guys, my buddy Will is here.
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.140]  He's a glassblower.
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.140]  He's also known as atbarefootglass on Instagram.
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.140]  Are you on Twitter?
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.140]  Not on Twitter.
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:33.140]  He's on Instagram.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:35.140]  You guys, make sure you check him out on Instagram.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.140]  Go look at his posts while you're listening to this podcast.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:39.140]  It's atbarefootglass.
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:42.140]  He's kind of an up-and-coming glass artist.
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:43.140]  You're kind of a new guy.
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.140]  How long have you been blowing glass, bro?
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:46.140]  Yeah, I started in July, so late July.
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:47.140]  Oh, so you're really new there.
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:48.140]  Yeah, coming up on four months now.
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:49.140]  Holy shit, right on.
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:50.140]  Well, congratulations.
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:51.140]  Thank you.
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.140]  You're doing hella good.
[01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:53.140]  Well, appreciate it, man.
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:56.140]  You gave me a dabber several months ago.
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.140]  Yep, right when I first started.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.140]  It's taken a couple of tumbles, and it has not broken yet.
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:01.140]  Sweet, nice.
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.140]  That's a sign of a glass blower that kind of knows what he's doing.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.140]  Well, thank you, man.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.140]  Oh, for sure, man.
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:06.140]  I appreciate you being on the show.
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:10.140]  I'm looking for the news article that I had tagged here, but of course, I refreshed, and now it's gone.
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:12.140]  So it'll come back up here.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:15.140]  Yeah, dude, technically, it can be the best, and it can be the worst thing on the planet.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:17.140]  Well, dude, thanks for coming to the show.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:18.140]  I've got a news article.
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:19.140]  I can't find it on my computer.
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:22.140]  I'm getting it going here, I promise you, but I don't even need the news article.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.140]  Talk about it.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:25.140]  Something weird happened here recently in Colorado.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:37.140]  Snoop Dogg has signed a deal with Live Well, a dispensary here in Colorado, to produce a strain of cannabis and market this cannabis under the Snoop Dogg name at Live Well.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:43.140]  Now, that sounds like a really cool thing, but Will's looking at me and shaking his head kind of to the side, kind of like, eh.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:50.140]  If you guys have heard the show in the past, we've reported about Live Well putting a whole bunch of shitty-ass pesticides in their cannabis.
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:57:02.140]  If you come to Colorado and you shop at Live Well, you'll be disappointed because it's pretty much like going to the shittiest street dealer you can ever find and buying the shittiest dirt weed you can find for way too much money.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:04.140]  And it always seems old, like old weed.
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:11.140]  Yeah, just old, and it's probably because they're using pesticides in low-quality grow conditions.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.140]  I've only been there a couple times.
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:13.140]  Not my cup of tea.
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:14.140]  Not your cup of tea?
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:15.140]  No, not at all.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:23.140]  So, I think it's really weird that Snoop has come and done a deal with the shittiest, like they've got the reputation for being the shittiest dispensary in Colorado.
[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:28.140]  Snoop's publicist or publishing or public people should have done a lot more research on this shit.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:30.140]  This is a big fail on Snoop's publicists.
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:31.140]  I think that's what you call them.
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:32.140]  Publicists?
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.140]  Publicists.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:34.140]  Yeah, it's their fault.
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:35.140]  That guy failed.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.140]  They should have done a little more work.
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:40.140]  And I'm also curious, I am not a law expert, but Snoop is not a Colorado resident.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:44.140]  How is Snoop able to participate in a Colorado cannabis business?
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.140]  I'm very curious about that.
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:52.140]  So, if you guys have some insight on that, Mike, if you're listening, please tweet me or come be on the show, and we will talk about how Snoop's able to do this.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.140]  This is kind of wacky, guys.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:57.140]  Snoop signed up with the shittiest dispensary here in Colorado, and I'm not just talking shit.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:09.140]  If you're in Colorado and you go to Live Well and then go to almost any other dispensary, go to the Spot dispensary, go to Green and Healthy Wellness when they reopen here in about two weeks, you will see quality products prepared to live well.
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:10.140]  Very quality.
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:11.140]  Very quality.
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:12.140]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:14.140]  And, by the way, Terp Station is only medical, so I apologize.
[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.140]  You got to be medical.
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:16.140]  All right.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:17.140]  So, I wanted to talk about that for a second.
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:18.140]  We got past the Snoop Dogg part.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:22.140]  We did not even need any help from the news article.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.140]  Snoop, big fail, bro.
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:26.140]  If you need some good weed, come hit me up.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:31.140]  I'll hook you up with a dispensary, and I'll show you how to grow, and I'll show you how I grow, and we'll produce some quality buds for you.
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:32.140]  We'll do it.
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:34.140]  We'll make a strain for you called Doggy Style.
[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:35.140]  We'll do it.
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:36.140]  All right.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:37.140]  So, Will's a glass blower.
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:39.140]  Let's talk a little bit about blowing glass.
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:41.140]  Dude, you brought some great-looking pieces with you.
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.140]  Oh, I appreciate it, man.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:45.140]  The piece right in front of me is that called Illuminati or is that Slime?
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.140]  This is Haterade, actually.
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:47.140]  Haterade.
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:48.140]  Oh, shit.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:49.140]  It's very similar.
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:50.140]  Yeah.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.140]  It's Haterade.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:52.140]  All right.
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:53.140]  Very specific.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.140]  Okay, that's a good random question.
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:55.140]  Where did these names come from?
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:56.140]  The glass name, the color of the glass?
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.140]  Yeah.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:58.140]  Whoever the company that makes it or the person that pulls it.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.140]  Okay.
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:00.140]  There's each one.
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:07.140]  There's like Glass Alchemy, Mountain Glass Arts, and then Taffy Tubes, D&L Borough here in Denver.
[01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:08.140]  Okay.
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:12.140]  Just a bunch of different companies that pull different colors and they name it whatever they want.
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:16.140]  There's a few that go across the board like Blue Stardust is one that every company most likely has.
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:17.140]  Okay.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:22.140]  But then there's a few, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but that are just specifically a company made them.
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:23.140]  Okay.
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:24.140]  All right.
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:25.140]  So, is this a common color or is this one?
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:26.140]  Haterade's a pretty common one, yeah.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:27.140]  All right.
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.140]  All right.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.140]  So, what's the difference between Haterade, Slime, and Illuminati?
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.140]  Illuminati is UV reactive.
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:34.140]  Illuminati looks just like Haterade pretty much.
[01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:39.140]  A little bit more on the yellow side probably, but it's UV reactive, so when you hit it with the UV light, it glows.
[01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:40.140]  It's pretty neat.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:43.140]  I've got a little Pendi from shout out to Ghost Cat Glass with some UV in it.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.140]  All right.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:46.140]  And then Slime, of course, is a little.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:50.140]  Slime has that kind of, yeah, it's not as transparent as this, a little more opaque.
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.140]  Okay.
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:54.140]  It's got a little bit of white in it sometimes depending on how you stretch it and pull it.
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:55.140]  All right.
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:56.140]  So, you guys were already learning.
[01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.140]  We learned the difference.
[01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:58.140]  Illuminati Glass is really cool, you guys.
[01:59:58.140 --> 01:59:59.140]  It's real hip.
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:03.140]  If you're not in the glass scene, some of this episode may go over your head, but you're going to learn a whole bunch today.
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.140]  Oh, yeah.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:06.140]  The glass scene has got its own scene happening here in Colorado.
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:09.140]  It's got its own glass scene in California.
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:10.140]  It's everywhere.
[02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:11.140]  Florida.
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:12.140]  Yeah, the East Coast has got a glass scene popping up.
[02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:13.140]  It's everywhere.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.140]  There are now glass galleries all over the place.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:16.140]  It's really funny.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:19.140]  I go to glass events, and I don't even, Will and I hang out.
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.140]  We are friends through the Garden of Weeden.
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:27.140]  We don't really hang out on our own, but we always bump into each other at Illusion's Glass Galleries.
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:28.140]  We ran into each other at Champs.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:31.140]  All the, who's calling you now?
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:32.140]  Matty Good.
[02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:33.140]  You miss Matty?
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:34.140]  Shut up.
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:35.140]  That's the best person they could call right now.
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.140]  Hey, Matty, come be on the podcast again.
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:38.140]  We get so many listens when you're here.
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:44.140]  But we run into each other at glass places, glass events all the time, so we're both huge glass enthusiasts, which is kind of great.
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:45.140]  So does this rig have a name?
[02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:46.140]  Who blew this one?
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:47.140]  This is Whitey Glass.
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:48.140]  Whitey Glass.
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.140]  Yeah, Whitey Glass is his name.
[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:50.140]  I don't know his actual name.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.140]  I feel kind of bad about that, but Whitey Glass is his Instagram.
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:56.140]  Whitey, I don't even know if there's an underscore or anything, but if you look up Whitey Glass, you'll find him.
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:57.140]  He's real good.
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.140]  He's killing the Klein game right now.
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:00:59.140]  Maybe you'll see this Klein game.
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:00.140]  Klein game.
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:03.140]  Yeah, so these pieces with this weird spout on the back, that's called the Klein, right?
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:04.140]  Yeah, this is the Klein.
[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:05.140]  Klein is like a recycler.
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:11.140]  It's the new kind of cool recycler that everyone is liking as opposed to the old triangular-shaped recycler.
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:16.140]  This is more of an internal one, even though it's not technically internal with the drains and the drain in the back, everything.
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:18.140]  I really like the way those types of rigs hit.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:20.140]  I've got a little Klein, and I love the way that they hit.
[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:21.140]  They're awesome.
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:22.140]  They're awesome.
[02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:23.140]  All right, so shout out to Whitey Glass.
[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:24.140]  That's a sexy piece, dude.
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:25.140]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.140]  Tell me more about this rubber ducky-looking thing you've got.
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:30.140]  This little birdie right here, this is a Calm Birdling.
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.140]  This is number 38 in the series.
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:34.140]  Just kind of a little—
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:35.140]  Of how many?
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:37.140]  I'm not sure on that, what I want to say.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:38.140]  Maybe he's not done.
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:39.140]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:40.140]  Maybe he'll keep going.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:41.140]  I know I've got number 38.
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:42.140]  Sweet.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:43.140]  It came with a little tin that you can see over there.
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:46.140]  It's got a little drawing on the top that he did, signed and everything.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.140]  That's fresh.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.140]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.140]  But yeah, it's a little series.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:51.140]  Calvin Mickle is his name.
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:54.140]  Calm, Calmbo on Instagram.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.140]  He's one of my favorites.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.140]  Oh, I follow Calmbo.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.140]  Yeah, he makes really cool birds.
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:00.140]  This is more of one of the simpler ones, kind of a production series.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.140]  So it's kind of a puck-type base, which is hollow and functional.
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:05.140]  That's where the perk is sitting.
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:06.140]  Yeah, it's a little—
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:11.140]  He's got a donut, which functions as basically the head of the bird.
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:13.140]  It's got a beak.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:14.140]  What color is the beak?
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.140]  The beak looks like green stardust, I think is what this one is.
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:17.140]  Green stardust, all right.
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:20.140]  And then he's got a couple of white wings that are attached to the base.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:23.140]  And then you've got a little club banger on there.
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:25.140]  Yeah, just a little—I got this at Illusions.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:26.140]  Nice.
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:27.140]  Yeah, a little banger.
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:28.140]  A little quartz banger.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:30.140]  We're going to talk more about the bangers here in just a few minutes.
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:32.140]  One of my notes is all about the banger.
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:34.140]  Remind me the artist on that one.
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:36.140]  That is Calmbo.
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.140]  Calmbo, all right.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.140]  So shout-out to Calmbo Glass.
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:39.140]  You guys, make sure you check out all these artists on Instagram.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.140]  We're going to talk a lot about artists.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:41.140]  Make sure you go check them out.
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:42.140]  Definitely.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:44.140]  I'll list off some of my favorite artists towards the end of the episode.
[02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:46.140]  I'm going to ask Will some of his favorites also.
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:49.140]  So we will definitely give you some shit to look at.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:52.140]  So next up is a glorious piece.
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:55.140]  What is this piece here on the front called?
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:57.140]  It would be called a cab when it's connected like this.
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:58.140]  It's called a cab.
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:01.140]  It's a little Dykro Iguana cab.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.140]  This piece is made by Mongrel Glass.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:07.140]  His name is Jack Albershart.
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:10.140]  Good friend of mine from actually back in North Carolina.
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:12.140]  Shout-out to North Carolina.
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:13.140]  So there are people left?
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:15.140]  You guys didn't bring everybody from North Carolina out?
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:16.140]  No, he's out here.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:17.140]  He lives out here.
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.140]  Holy shit.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:21.140]  You guys, that's funny because Maddie and Spence moved out here close to two years ago.
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:24.140]  And then everybody else from the town of Dixie came out here.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.140]  And then all the surrounding areas, all the cool stoners are just moving to Colorado.
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:31.140]  Everybody from North Carolina is coming out here.
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:32.140]  And it's really funny to see.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.140]  But I love it.
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:36.140]  You guys are so – the North Carolina people are some of my favorite friends to hang out with.
[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:38.140]  They're a different breed of folk.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:39.140]  They're more open.
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.140]  They're kinder.
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:41.140]  They're more polite.
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:42.140]  They got more time.
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:45.140]  Yeah, we got that southern charm but not that southern – I don't know.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.140]  Yeah, the southern charm without the trailer park vibe.
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:49.140]  Exactly.
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:50.140]  I can say that because I'm not one of you.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:51.140]  Exactly.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.140]  There you go.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:53.140]  I see it.
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.140]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.140]  All right.
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:56.140]  Dude, this piece, what is going on with the piece you're telling us about?
[02:03:56.140 --> 02:03:57.140]  Yeah, this is sweet.
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:58.140]  This is one of my favorites.
[02:03:58.140 --> 02:03:59.140]  This is called the Safari Special.
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:00.140]  Okay.
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:03.140]  It's a really big, really big base with a tiny little mouthpiece.
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.140]  It's got the tiny little bamboo.
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:05.140]  Okay, that is pretty tiny.
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:06.140]  But we'll try it out in a minute.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:07.140]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:12.140]  He did – it's kind of hard to talk about it over the microphone without you people seeing it.
[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:15.140]  But it's got this giant basically showerhead perk in it.
[02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:17.140]  It's got like seven holes.
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:19.140]  It fucking froths like –
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:21.140]  Oh, they can hear that.
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:22.140]  Yeah.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:28.140]  Yeah, it's got a nice function, a couple of leaves on the inside with some flower implosions attached to the perk.
[02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:31.140]  It looks like somewhere that Ariel the Little Mermaid would want to kick it.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.140]  Exactly.
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:37.140]  It totally looks like – it's got some – so is this a banger hanger?
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:39.140]  Would this officially be called –
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:40.140]  This I would call a banger hanger.
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:41.140]  Okay, all right.
[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:45.140]  And while we're on that subject about banger hangers, I want to give another shout out to Mongo Glass here
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:48.140]  because he was one of the first, in my opinion, to start using this.
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:50.140]  And he even posted about it a while ago.
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:52.140]  It was before even bangers were a thing.
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:53.140]  It was e-nails.
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:58.140]  When e-nails were a big thing, he was one of the first people to start going back to the original female joint
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:00.140]  as opposed to the male joint that people were using for dabbing
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:06.140]  because he noticed the trend of people using attachments and e-nails and stuff and everything.
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:09.140]  So I remember him making a post about it and everything about,
[02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:12.140]  I'm thinking about making the transition back to just this, blah, blah, blah.
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:15.140]  And he was one of the first people, in my opinion, to really –
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.140]  I was confused when I first saw him going back to e-nails.
[02:05:17.140 --> 02:05:20.140]  When I first saw him going back to the female joints, I was like, what's happening here?
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:22.140]  How do I put my nail in this bitch now?
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.140]  This is new.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.140]  And when I saw the bangers, the club bangers, we're going to have to talk about bangers in a minute.
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:28.140]  We're going to have to define those and write that down.
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:29.140]  People are like, what's a banger?
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:31.140]  What are they talking about?
[02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:34.140]  I wrote down the word banger just so we remember to talk about that a little bit.
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:38.140]  So this piece we're talking about, you guys, I know we've been talking about this piece for a long time.
[02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:41.140]  It's got a really fat base, and then it's got – what did you call this one again?
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:42.140]  It's a cab, Dycro.
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:46.140]  Dycro cab with an iguana, a super colorful iguana on the front.
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:47.140]  Seat of life in the back of that.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:51.140]  Seat of life, sacred geometry in the background.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:55.140]  Then when you spin it around in the back, there's like a mid with a flower and two leaves around it.
[02:05:55.140 --> 02:06:00.140]  And then it seals up, and coming out of the clear sealed part is three pieces of bamboo.
[02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:04.140]  The taller piece is the mouthpiece, and then it's got two beautifully detailed leaves.
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.140]  Oh, just one.
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:08.140]  One beautifully detailed leaf coming up the side.
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:09.140]  It's a pretty fresh-looking piece.
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:10.140]  That's a really stylish-looking rig.
[02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:12.140]  Yeah, it's one of my favorites for sure.
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:13.140]  I can see why.
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.140]  Yeah.
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:15.140]  Does it hit well with that skinny mouthpiece?
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:16.140]  Yeah, phenomenally.
[02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:17.140]  Cool.
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:18.140]  Phenomenally.
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:19.140]  Yeah, I heard you pull on it.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:20.140]  It chugs like a champ.
[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:21.140]  All right.
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.140]  So we got to give shout-outs to Mongrel, to Combo, and I forgot this guy, Whitey.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.140]  Whitey Glass.
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:25.140]  How do I forget Whitey Glass?
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:27.140]  People have called me Whitey all the time.
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:31.140]  I'm writing these names down so that we can give a huge shout-out at the end and make
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.140]  sure all these glassblowers get a bunch of love.
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:34.140]  Nice.
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:35.140]  All right.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:36.140]  So are these three of your favorites?
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:37.140]  In my collection?
[02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:38.140]  Yeah.
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:39.140]  Oh, yeah.
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:40.140]  These are probably three of my favorites in my collection for sure.
[02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.140]  I've got a couple more Kleins.
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:43.140]  I've got a couple more pieces by him.
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:48.140]  I've got the Wyoming Angler, but these are like my daily drivers for sure.
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:49.140]  Oh, you've got one of the Anglers?
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.140]  Yeah, I've got one of the Anglers.
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:51.140]  You guys check those out on Instagram.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.140]  Those are crazy.
[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:54.140]  Some of the teeth make me nervous about them.
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.140]  They're sharp.
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.140]  Yeah, you can just bust those off and it scares me.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:00.140]  I've worked with more of the functional, clear prototype glass for myself.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.140]  It's more my thing.
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:04.140]  So since we're talking about your glass, I'm going to brag about my new rig.
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:05.140]  I've got this Hitman over here.
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:07.140]  It's actually a Hitman-Samson collab.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:09.140]  It's got basic Hitman.
[02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:10.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:12.140]  It's got a basic Hitman sidecar design, but then it's got this sweet,
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:14.140]  what do you call that color?
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:15.140]  Greenish, turquoise, blue.
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:16.140]  I don't even know.
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:17.140]  That's a nice mix.
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:19.140]  It looks like a custom pool to be honest.
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:21.140]  It's definitely a custom sort of thing because I've never seen anything like that.
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:23.140]  So that's the one I've been pulling on lately.
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.140]  I really love that rig.
[02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:25.140]  So shout out to Hitman Glass.
[02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:26.140]  Shout out to Dougie.
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:31.140]  I like the clear glass that's made by like a brand that's known like Hitman
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:36.140]  because I have nothing against these rigs, but when you buy one of these,
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:38.140]  the function sometimes is questionable.
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.140]  Definitely.
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:42.140]  I have friends of ours spend thousands of dollars on a rig,
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:45.140]  and if you put four milliliters too much water in it,
[02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:46.140]  you're going to get it in your mouth.
[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:49.140]  And if you put five milliliters too short,
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:51.140]  you get a dry dab and you choke for days.
[02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:54.140]  And I love that these production rigs that are made the same all the time,
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:56.140]  I love that I know what I'm getting when I buy them.
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:59.140]  And if I break it, I don't want to break it, but if I do,
[02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:01.140]  I can replace that fairly easily.
[02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:04.140]  Just go to the Hitman store, which is illusions around here,
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.140]  and just go grab one off the shelf.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:07.140]  Exactly.
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:08.140]  You're not out of $1,000.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.140]  Right. And if you break this, this is artwork.
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:12.140]  I mean, this is art as well, but this took much.
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.140]  This is a proto artwork.
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:17.140]  Yeah, like this one, this is the only safari special that's out there.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:18.140]  And it's gorgeous.
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:19.140]  It is gorgeous.
[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:20.140]  That's a great piece.
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:22.140]  You guys, I'll take a picture of it and I'll put it on my Instagram.
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:24.140]  I just promised that, so I have to do it,
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:26.140]  which means you guys need to check out my Instagram.
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:28.140]  I'm writing down Insta.
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:30.140]  So you guys got to check out my Instagram,
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:34.140]  at I read genetics that are pictures of these rigs on there.
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:35.140]  Why am I ringing?
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:38.140]  That's so weird that the MacBook is ringing.
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:40.140]  We're just going to decline that shit.
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:41.140]  All right.
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:43.140]  So if you're on a podcast, put all your shit on airplane mode.
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.140]  That's my advice to you.
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:48.140]  Where the shits were wise, talking about rigs, right?
[02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:51.140]  All right, dude, right on for bringing thousands of dollars worth of glass.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:52.140]  That is freaking awesome.
[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:54.140]  We're going to have to grab a torture in just a second.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.140]  Some of these bangers.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:57.140]  Let's talk about the banger.
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:08:59.140]  So everybody, I talk about dabbing off the nail.
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.140]  You guys, I like the nail because I can hook the titanium nail up to the email.
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.140]  The nails that I use are usually titanium.
[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:08.140]  They go onto a male joint that points up.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:12.140]  You drop the nail onto there or you put your other dome type nail inside there.
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:14.140]  Like our buddy was talking about,
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:18.140]  this dude decided to flip back to the female joint because he saw the trend of
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:22.140]  accessories and what we're calling bangers coming out.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:25.140]  So there's a guy, everyone calls him quave,
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:27.140]  but I think it's actually pronounced quav.
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:28.140]  I'm not even sure.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.140]  I go back and forth on it.
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:31.140]  Honestly, potato, potato,
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:34.140]  how I hear you say it's how I say it in conversation.
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.140]  It's like the truth.
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:37.140]  So quave is more comfortable.
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:38.140]  Quav sounds a little fancier.
[02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:39.140]  It's a little weird.
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:40.140]  Yeah.
[02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:41.140]  So anyway,
[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:43.140]  there was a guy named quav who made what we call the banger.
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:46.140]  It's got a male joint that goes into your rig.
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:50.140]  That's got a female joint and then it comes straight up and then it curves out
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:52.140]  to, there are multiple different angles available.
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:54.140]  You can get it at 90 or 45,
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:56.140]  probably other angles as well,
[02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.140]  but then it's got just a basic,
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:00.140]  it looks like a small,
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:02.140]  it looks like the lid to your chapstick.
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:03.140]  Good.
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:04.140]  Nice.
[02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:05.140]  You like that?
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:07.140]  But it's clear it's made out of quartz.
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:11.140]  And so you heat that shit up and then you let it cool and then you drop your
[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:12.140]  dab in there.
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:13.140]  And the theory,
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:16.140]  and I believe it is that the quartz is giving a much cleaner,
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:20.140]  more flavorful hit from your dab compared to the titanium.
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:22.140]  And I really agree with it.
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:25.140]  My problem is I'm a little clumsy and I would,
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:26.140]  I'm going to break that.
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:28.140]  And you got to keep that a little bit cleaner.
[02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:32.140]  It's definitely more high maintenance having the banger with the tie,
[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:33.140]  you know,
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:36.140]  you can get it real dirty and then just get it hot and hit it with a,
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:39.140]  one of those little brushes for the grill,
[02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:40.140]  even almost as little steel wool,
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.140]  steel wool type things and get it fresh and clean.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.140]  But with the banger,
[02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:44.140]  once it gets dirty,
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:45.140]  it's it's dirty.
[02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:46.140]  And if you want to keep it clean,
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:47.140]  you got to do the,
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:50.140]  you just got to keep Q-tipping it every day for every use and all that stuff.
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:51.140]  Yeah.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:52.140]  He did it all the time.
[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:53.140]  Q-tip tech.
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.140]  You want to go down that route?
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:55.140]  Oh,
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:56.140]  I was going to say,
[02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:57.140]  let's talk about the Q-tip tech.
[02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:58.140]  Are they ready for the Q-tip tech yet?
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.140]  Well,
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:00.140]  Q-tip tech since we're on.
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:01.140]  So that's a banger.
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:03.140]  You guys basically a banger is made out of quartz.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:04.140]  A lot of them are made out of glass.
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:06.140]  I don't see a problem with dabbing out of the glass piece,
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:07.140]  but it's not going to taste as good.
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:08.140]  It's not going to last as long.
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:10.140]  It's going to break after heating and cooling.
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:12.140]  So long the quartz is better quality.
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:13.140]  If you're going to use anything,
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:14.140]  courts are tied.
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:15.140]  Definitely one of the two.
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:16.140]  Yeah.
[02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:17.140]  And if you're going to maybe ceramic,
[02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:18.140]  the Halen honey holes are great.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:20.140]  If you're going for something made out of quartz,
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:21.140]  the Halen troughs are amazing.
[02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:22.140]  Those are awesome.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.140]  The Kov banger,
[02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:24.140]  the banger knockoffs are cool.
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:26.140]  If you trust your artist and your vendor,
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:28.140]  trust where your stuff is coming from.
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.140]  Try not to buy some china.
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.140]  That's where I was heading up.
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:31.140]  No China glass.
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:33.140]  It's made by little kids that aren't using proper protection.
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:35.140]  Is there a difference in the glass?
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:37.140]  It's really hard to tell,
[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:38.140]  but yeah,
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:44.140]  there is definitely a difference in there's quartz qualities and the Chinese manufacturers are definitely going to be using much lower quality courts.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:45.140]  Cheap as they can find.
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:46.140]  As cheap as they can find,
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.140]  because it's just some douche over here trying to make money,
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:51.140]  just exploiting the market.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:52.140]  Right.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:54.140]  And you're definitely going to find lower grade.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:57.140]  Chinese made quartz is going to be much lower grade than American made.
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:58.140]  Just like titanium.
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:11:59.140]  Exactly.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:03.140]  I know we sound like a bunch of snobby douches when we talk about getting a quality nail,
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:04.140]  but that's your health.
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:06.140]  You're heating this product up to,
[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.140]  I don't even know how many degrees,
[02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:09.140]  hot enough to burn the shit out of yourself.
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:11.140]  And you're putting your medicine on there.
[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:14.140]  You're putting your hash on there and you're smoking directly into your lungs.
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:16.140]  So whatever's in that,
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:17.140]  you're going to dab it.
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:21.140]  If it's something that puts off some sort of gas or has an oil on it or some kind of shit,
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.140]  you're going to dab that right along with your Earl.
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:25.140]  So get a quality nail.
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:26.140]  That's super important to me.
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:27.140]  Definitely.
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:28.140]  Yeah.
[02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.140]  So Q-tip tech,
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:31.140]  after you're done dabbing with your banger,
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:33.140]  you got to heat that bitch up and clean it out with a Q-tip.
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:34.140]  Right?
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:35.140]  Well,
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:36.140]  you don't even heat it.
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:37.140]  In theory is that if you get the good,
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.140]  you get a good temperature where it's not too hot.
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.140]  So you're done dabbing,
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:41.140]  you get your good temperature.
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:44.140]  You got to do it pretty much immediately after you grab a Q-tip,
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:45.140]  you wipe the inside.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:46.140]  There should be like a little bit of a,
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.140]  not a puddle,
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:48.140]  but some wetness in there.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.140]  You get it quick enough.
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:50.140]  It'll clean it out.
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:51.140]  Look good as new.
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:52.140]  You're good to go.
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:53.140]  You don't even got to heat it up.
[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:54.140]  Like this nail,
[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:55.140]  for example,
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:12:56.140]  I was trying to do it.
[02:12:56.140 --> 02:12:57.140]  This is a couple of weeks old now,
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:58.140]  but you know,
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:12:59.140]  it still looks pretty decent.
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:00.140]  Yeah,
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:01.140]  I see it working.
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:03.140]  But on this one you can see I haven't done the Q-tip tech as well and it's like at the
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:04.140]  darkness.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:05.140]  Starting to look ashy.
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:06.140]  Exactly.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.140]  All right.
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:08.140]  So keep it clean.
[02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:09.140]  That's kind of what you're saying.
[02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:10.140]  Yeah,
[02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:11.140]  definitely.
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:12.140]  That's why Spitz is always in there heating that shit.
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.140]  Right?
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.140]  Yeah.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.140]  So that's going to burn it,
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.140]  but that's not gonna,
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:17.140]  that's also going to like burn it and heat it.
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:18.140]  Like it burns it a little bit.
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.140]  So the Q-tip tech is definitely like the ideal,
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:20.140]  I guess.
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:21.140]  It's just,
[02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:22.140]  it's definitely catching on.
[02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:23.140]  I saw you saying something on Facebook about Q-tip tech.
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:24.140]  The Q-tip tech,
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:25.140]  I don't have a problem with the Q-tip tech.
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:26.140]  It's these new Q-tip holders is what I find hilarious.
[02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:27.140]  $300 glass Q-tip holders.
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:28.140]  There's,
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:29.140]  there's some janky ones that you'll see go on for like $150 and it's literally,
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:30.140]  it's literally a shot glass for you people.
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.140]  It's a shot glass that a glass blower made and put some color on and some of these guys
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:32.140]  are like,
[02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:33.140]  Oh,
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:44.140]  it's just $150 is blue,
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:45.140]  you know,
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:46.140]  and there's these little guys.
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:47.140]  They're putting absolutely no time into it.
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:48.140]  You can tell and they put them up for auctions and they go for like 150.
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.140]  There was one,
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:51.360]  I will say the one that started the whole hype on it was,
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:52.360]  uh,
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:58.040]  a two stroke and sleek lab that they posted and I think they kind of posted it as a joke
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:13:59.040]  originally and then they,
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:02.660]  and then they got a ton of hype behind it and so they decided to auction it off and
[02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:05.220]  they went for $2,200 shit and I'm not,
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:06.220]  don't get me wrong.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:07.220]  I mean this shit was amazing.
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.500]  These are two stroke and sleek or phenomenal glass artists and their work goes,
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:12.020]  I mean their work is expensive,
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:14.380]  but at the end of the day it was a shot glass,
[02:14:14.380 --> 02:14:15.700]  Q-tip holder is what they were selling.
[02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:17.540]  It's a thing to hold Q-tips, you know what I'm saying?
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.380]  And yeah.
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:19.700]  So that you can dab.
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.700]  Exactly.
[02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:23.860]  But this whole Q-tip holder thing blew up overnight
[02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:24.700]  and it's insane.
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:26.500]  You can do something with that kind of money.
[02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:27.340]  You can do a lot of stuff with that kind of money.
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:29.940]  You can change communities with $22,000.
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:30.780]  No, 2200.
[02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:31.600]  22, okay.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:33.100]  Yeah, 22,000, that'd be insane.
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:33.940]  2200 though.
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:34.780]  You can still change some communities.
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:35.620]  Still, 2200 is.
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.820]  2200 would change your day.
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:38.340]  Oh, 2200 would change a week.
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:39.620]  A lot of people listening right now,
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:41.220]  that would fix their whole damn car.
[02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:42.660]  Their car would not be falling apart.
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:44.380]  If I had 2200, I'd be straight right now.
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:45.420]  Right, oh yeah.
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:47.060]  I'm doing okay and I'd take 2200.
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:49.420]  Damn.
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:51.580]  All right, so how long ago did you make
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:53.980]  your first Q-tip holder before it got popular?
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:56.700]  I honestly, like I didn't make it as a Q-tip holder
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:58.380]  when I first started,
[02:14:58.380 --> 02:14:59.500]  probably one of my first,
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:00.740]  after a month about being on the torch,
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:02.740]  I was working with shaping to make mini tubes
[02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:04.580]  and I started making shot glasses,
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:05.720]  last little nug jar things.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:07.620]  That was what I was calling them
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:08.460]  and my shopmate was calling them,
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.340]  he was like, yeah, nug jars, you know?
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:12.180]  Which is what they are.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:13.500]  And then I took it home and I was like,
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:15.460]  oh look, I can put Q-tips in these, ha ha.
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:17.860]  It's a Q-tip holder, it's a Hedi Q-tip holder.
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:19.020]  And I had a buddy come in town
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:19.860]  and I was showing him, I was like,
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:21.620]  hey dude, Hedi Q-tip holder, ha ha.
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:22.460]  And we joked about it.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:24.560]  And this was a solid two months ago,
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.580]  maybe a month and a half even.
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.260]  And I have a, there's a picture on my Instagram,
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:29.500]  five weeks old on my Instagram,
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:30.820]  you can see it on the table.
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:31.660]  It's, I'm not lying.
[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:32.500]  It's full of Q-tips.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.860]  I'm not trying to be that guy, but you know.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:36.420]  And me and my buddy joked about it,
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:37.700]  like oh, that's so stupid, like ha ha.
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.280]  Like Hedi Q-tip holder, that would never sell.
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.480]  Like that's just another like, if it did, ha ha.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.580]  And sure as shit, here we are a month and a half later
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:45.700]  with $2,200 Q-tip holders.
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:47.460]  Man, talking about it on the podcast.
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:48.300]  Yep.
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.220]  God.
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:50.060]  But whatever.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:51.340]  Yeah, well now you could still make them.
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:52.420]  Yeah, I mean, it's never too late.
[02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:53.260]  People are doing it.
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:55.300]  I just, I hate jumping on the hype train like that.
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:56.140]  Right.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:57.500]  I'm just not, I don't like doing that.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.340]  Yeah.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.100]  But it's, ugh, whatever.
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.180]  Hashtag Q-tip tech.
[02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:05.060]  Hashtag Q-tip holder tech, $2,200.
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:07.580]  Oh man, you guys are gonna have to go YouTube-ing
[02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:10.500]  and Instagram-ing so much shit after this.
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:11.700]  So much stuff.
[02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:14.620]  All right, so we talked about Q-tip tech.
[02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:16.020]  I should have asked you way long time ago,
[02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:17.340]  but the conversation was fun.
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:19.580]  Who are some of the glass blowers that inspired you
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:21.540]  that got you into glass blowing?
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.020]  This guy right here, Mongrelass.
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:23.860]  Okay.
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:26.100]  Definitely like my biggest,
[02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.100]  he was my biggest help getting involved in everything.
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:28.940]  So you know him personally and you can't do anything?
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:29.780]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:31.940]  We're from, he went to high school.
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:33.180]  We didn't go to the same high school,
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:35.020]  but we are in the same county.
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:36.940]  And I had a lot of mutual friends in high school,
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:38.220]  didn't know each other in high school.
[02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:40.900]  We both ended up living in Asheville after high school.
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.660]  And I hit him up, so I knew he was blowing glass.
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:43.580]  And I was like, hey man,
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:45.020]  I'd love to come check out the studio.
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:45.860]  Would it be cool?
[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:46.700]  You know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:47.700]  And he was like, yeah, sure.
[02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:48.940]  Went down to the studio a couple times,
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:50.260]  hung out with him, hung out with him at his house
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:51.260]  a couple times, you know.
[02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:53.380]  Got to become pretty decent friends with him.
[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:54.420]  Bought some glass from him.
[02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:56.940]  And then he ended up moving out to Gunnison
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:59.980]  to work with Brian's, I don't know his last name,
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:01.060]  Berserker Glass.
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:02.060]  Is Berserker Glass.
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:04.700]  So he was working with Berserker, who's phenomenal.
[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:06.540]  He's a beast.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:08.180]  You guys definitely gotta look up Berserker.
[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:10.380]  Check out the dogs that he makes, the balloon animals.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:11.220]  They're so sweet.
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.060]  That's Blitzkrieg.
[02:17:12.060 --> 02:17:12.900]  Blitzkrieg, fuck you're right.
[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:13.820]  Really close, my bad.
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:14.660]  Yeah, it's okay.
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:16.580]  It's the same Blitzkrieg, Berserker.
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:18.220]  Bees and crazy noises.
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.940]  But he, Jack showed me a bunch of things on the torch
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:21.780]  a couple years ago.
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:24.340]  This is about probably three or four years ago now, I guess.
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:25.420]  Kept in touch with him over the years.
[02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:26.780]  And then I wanted to start doing it.
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:29.220]  And he gave me all the information I needed to do.
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:32.820]  Has let me come out to his studio here, check him out.
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:33.700]  So he's definitely my biggest,
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:35.940]  he sold me my first torch actually.
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:37.100]  Biggest, he was definitely my biggest help
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:39.460]  getting into glassblowing.
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.380]  And as far as guys that like,
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.140]  inspire me and motivate me and everything.
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:45.700]  I mean, Eushine Goings, definitely one of that.
[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:47.140]  He's definitely, he's phenomenal.
[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:48.660]  He's one of my favorites.
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:49.900]  Calm right here.
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:51.500]  Definitely one of my favorite like sculpture artists,
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:53.620]  or I guess he's sort of sculptural artist,
[02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:55.020]  but his birds are just phenomenal.
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:56.220]  I love him.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:58.060]  I was real big into elbow for a while.
[02:17:58.060 --> 02:17:59.580]  When the elbow, I mean,
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:01.060]  I was on the elbow bubble for a while,
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:02.940]  but then everybody was, it's huge.
[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:04.460]  And it definitely, I don't wanna say it popped,
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:06.580]  but it definitely deflated a little bit.
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:10.420]  Salt, of course, he was one of my favorites back in the day.
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:11.380]  You guys check out Salt.
[02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:12.860]  That's some crazy dirty shit.
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:13.700]  Yeah.
[02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:16.420]  And then one of the books,
[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:18.420]  oh my gosh, I cannot remember the name of them right now.
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:20.700]  I'm tripping, slipping.
[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:22.140]  These two books, they're,
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.900]  yeah, it was really before glass was a thing.
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:26.100]  They're these books, Smoked.
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:28.660]  Smoked Volume One and Two.
[02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:30.300]  They're books full of glass artists and everything.
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:31.180]  And it was before there was really
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:33.100]  a glass scene type of thing.
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:34.940]  It was just kind of like, this was how you found,
[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:36.220]  there was no Instagram.
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.500]  This was like, these were the heady artists at the time.
[02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:39.660]  And anybody in that book too,
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:40.980]  I can't really remember anyone specific
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:42.060]  because it was a while ago,
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:44.740]  but those books definitely were like, whoa,
[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:45.580]  this is kind of cool.
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.700]  It sparked you a little bit, stuck in your mind.
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:47.540]  All right.
[02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:48.380]  Yeah.
[02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:49.220]  All right.
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:51.220]  And Degenerate Art, the documentary.
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.940]  That was the biggest, I think,
[02:18:52.940 --> 02:18:55.420]  I watched that my freshman year in college.
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:56.540]  And I was already into glass.
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:57.380]  That's why we watched it,
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:58.220]  but we were more into,
[02:18:58.220 --> 02:18:59.980]  me and my roommate had a bunch of Roars.
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:02.580]  We had like Roars and 5150 AMGs,
[02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:04.300]  a bunch of straight tube rippers.
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:05.140]  Yeah.
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:07.300]  Exactly what it was.
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:08.140]  And then we were like,
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:09.580]  oh dude, there's this movie about glass on here.
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:10.420]  Let's watch it.
[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:12.020]  And that movie, honestly,
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:13.340]  I would say that movie changed my life.
[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:15.500]  It opened me up to my eyes to this scene of glass
[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:17.580]  that I had no idea even existed.
[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:19.060]  I was like, holy hell, this is crazy.
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:20.420]  Like, this is nuts.
[02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:22.340]  Did you get to meet Bob Snodgrass at Champs?
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:23.180]  I did.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:24.020]  I did meet Bob Snodgrass.
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:25.700]  That was really cool for me.
[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:26.540]  Shout out Bob Snodgrass.
[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:27.700]  Bob Snodgrass, man.
[02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:28.820]  He's the man.
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:33.340]  He's the OG godfather of modern day glass blowing for sure.
[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:34.740]  He kind of did it on accident too.
[02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:35.580]  Oh yeah.
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:36.420]  If you know how he did it.
[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:37.260]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:38.500]  Yeah, definitely check out Degenerate Art
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:41.900]  if you have any interest in glass or art
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.420]  or just culture in general.
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:44.260]  The culture, yeah.
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:45.380]  It's just a really,
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:46.900]  it's just a great, great film.
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:48.140]  If you're into cannabis culture
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:49.860]  and you're looking for something that you want to watch
[02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:50.820]  that's not just weed,
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:52.020]  like if your girlfriend's coming over
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:53.340]  and you want to watch something else,
[02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:54.540]  that's a good one to watch.
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:55.980]  She might be entertained by that too.
[02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:57.540]  It's not just another weed movie.
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:58.380]  It's awesome.
[02:19:58.900 --> 02:19:59.740]  It's really cool with that one
[02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:00.660]  because that was only four years ago
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:04.140]  that that documentary was produced and made and let out.
[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:06.820]  And it's just crazy to see how far
[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.660]  the glass industry and the market has come
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:10.460]  from 2011 to 2015.
[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:12.140]  Where in 2011,
[02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:14.660]  kind of this underground scene that like,
[02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:15.740]  there was nothing on it really
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.100]  until this documentary came out.
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.780]  And then at the time,
[02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:20.020]  in the documentary, I believe,
[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:21.980]  Scott Deppie, his most expensive piece at the time
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.060]  was $18,000.
[02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:26.740]  And that's a crazy amount of money obviously for a piece.
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:29.500]  But now Scott Deppie is selling pieces for,
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:31.100]  I mean 18 to 23,000 is,
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:32.260]  I mean that's nothing these days.
[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:33.100]  That's every day.
[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:35.580]  Yeah, he's got the $100,000 pieces going out.
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.740]  So what, I wanted to ask you,
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:38.380]  what makes the market do that kind of shit?
[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:41.140]  What makes an artist and the market jump up and down?
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.940]  And then like we said earlier,
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:44.740]  Elbow, the guy that makes the dino rigs,
[02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:46.620]  he shot up huge for a little while.
[02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:49.340]  And then one day everyone's just selling their elbows
[02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:51.420]  on Instagram for stupid cheap.
[02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:53.460]  What makes shit go like that in the glass market?
[02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:55.020]  Well, I definitely think what happened,
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:56.540]  what Instagram definitely helps.
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:59.620]  I mean, Instagram is a huge part of like who's doing,
[02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:02.620]  you know, who's what in the glass world, I guess.
[02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:05.900]  If they've got, you know, lots of followers on there,
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:07.340]  people are gonna think they're like,
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:09.660]  Oil Brothers, for example, Matt Boglen.
[02:21:09.660 --> 02:21:11.780]  He's good, he's really good.
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:14.300]  But his first rig that he put up for sale,
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:16.140]  it was a little coil potted green mini rig
[02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:18.180]  and it sold for like $800 at auction.
[02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:19.780]  And it was like his first rig that he ever sold
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:21.820]  just because, yeah, it was a hype thing.
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:23.700]  But I guess with the market,
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.580]  what happened was like everybody all of a sudden
[02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:28.620]  started getting into it and it built really fast.
[02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:30.900]  Like it went from nothing to something like in a year,
[02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:33.660]  mothership prices were quadrupling just because,
[02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:35.740]  I really don't know what it was.
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:36.660]  It just be kind of like,
[02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:38.100]  people started finding out about it.
[02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:40.500]  I guess it wasn't all of a sudden an underground thing
[02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:42.700]  that it was like, you know, people had Instagrams,
[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:43.540]  they get to show their stuff,
[02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:45.260]  so people were buying more stuff.
[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:47.660]  And then everyone, when the market peaked,
[02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:48.780]  everyone was like, oh man,
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:50.220]  like kind of like a stock market almost.
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:51.300]  It's like a stock market crash
[02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:52.740]  if you wanna think about it like that.
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:53.940]  Where, you know, everyone's like,
[02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:55.860]  oh, I gotta sell, sell, sell, buy, buy, buy.
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.980]  And you know, when mothership is like,
[02:21:57.980 --> 02:21:59.420]  now's the time to sell the motherships.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:00.820]  And so everybody sells their ships
[02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:02.540]  or I guess Elbow in this example,
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:05.020]  everybody had the Brontos and they were like buying them for,
[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:06.820]  I bought mine for $2,000 for example.
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:09.620]  I bought it from Illusion, $2,000 brand new.
[02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:14.620]  Sold it about six months later for $1,700.
[02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:16.700]  And I struggled selling it for that, you know what I'm saying?
[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:19.500]  Yeah, and it was usually like before that had no problem.
[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:22.340]  I definitely bought mine at the peak of the hype.
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:23.220]  I remember when you got it.
[02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.900]  Yeah, it was like right when I came down for vacation
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:25.740]  for the first time before I moved.
[02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:26.860]  It was a great little rig.
[02:22:26.860 --> 02:22:27.700]  Yeah, it was sweet.
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:28.540]  I definitely love that thing.
[02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:30.700]  But I think definitely people,
[02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:33.660]  they see what the rigs are going for retail wise.
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:34.980]  And so they're like, okay, that's retail.
[02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:36.860]  I'm gonna, they put a hype price on it
[02:22:36.860 --> 02:22:37.900]  and it goes for a little bit more.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:39.380]  And then eventually it's gonna build up to a point
[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:40.700]  and then people are gonna be like, fuck that.
[02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:42.300]  I'm not paying that anymore.
[02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:43.460]  So the price will start going down.
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:45.820]  And then all of a sudden everybody starts to sell their rigs
[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.380]  trying to, oh, should I get rid of this now
[02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:49.340]  while they're still worth something?
[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:53.340]  And then that in itself depreciates the value a little bit.
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:55.060]  So a little interesting.
[02:22:55.060 --> 02:22:56.500]  It's funny to see the mothership hype.
[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:57.340]  I saw the motherships go.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:22:59.060]  That's just a rollercoaster, man.
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:04.060]  The same rig went from 12 to 18 to 24 to 28 to 32.
[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:05.940]  And now they're about 18.
[02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:07.340]  Dude, there was a time when you could get,
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:10.740]  I mean, clear ships were going for like 9K at one point,
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:11.780]  5K, some shit.
[02:23:11.780 --> 02:23:13.900]  I was like, holy hell, are you kidding me?
[02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:14.740]  There are new ships.
[02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:18.820]  One just sold for $35,000 for the new Trifecta.
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:21.820]  So mothership is known for the Klein,
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:24.700]  the Taurus and the Fab Egg.
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:28.020]  And they combined all three into one rig.
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:32.020]  Sandblasted it and put some crazy logos on it.
[02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:33.660]  Sold it for $35,000.
[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:35.020]  So shout out to Scott Deppie.
[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:37.140]  He's doing all right over there.
[02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:38.180]  Big shout out to the mothership.
[02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:40.780]  If you want to see some crazy glass, you guys,
[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:41.780]  excuse me, I'm all choked up.
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:43.380]  I'm getting something in my throat here.
[02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:45.180]  If you want to see some nice, crazy glass,
[02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:46.740]  some high quality glass,
[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:49.620]  just hit hashtag mothership,

[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:11.660]  Yeah, just the mini with the little swing on it.
[02:24:11.660 --> 02:24:14.060]  Yeah, but if you want, yeah.
[02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:15.340]  Anything that's not a fixie,
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:17.260]  you're looking at $2,800.
[02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:19.740]  1800 minimum and up.
[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:20.580]  Yeah, so.
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:22.300]  Yeah, and that's like 1800 for just the rig.
[02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:24.460]  No bucket swing cap, nothing like that.
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:26.420]  And it's just all hype on names too.
[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:28.300]  Oh man, holy crap.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:29.820]  So how long is it going to take for you
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.860]  to climb your way up to the top there?
[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:33.260]  Oh, I don't even know.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:36.300]  That's like, if I ever get up there, that'd be awesome.
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:38.580]  But it's just really a matter of,
[02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:40.060]  I mean, with the glass,
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.020]  it's kind of one of those who you know,
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:44.580]  it's definitely a lot of what you know,
[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:47.060]  but it is a little bit of who you know too
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:48.620]  and who you can sell to.
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:51.540]  And I'm lucky enough where starting out,
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:52.940]  I have friends from like,
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:56.020]  cause I used to manage a shop back in North Carolina,
[02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:57.900]  a head shop back in North Carolina for a little bit.
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:00.420]  And so I've made a little bit of connections through that.
[02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:02.340]  And I have a friend who just opened up a shop
[02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:05.460]  in North Carolina, Transparent Dreams on Instagram.
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:06.300]  Check them out, you guys.
[02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:09.220]  Grew up in North Carolina, if anyone wants to check it out.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:11.820]  And then some of my old coworkers have opened up shops.
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.780]  So I've had outlets to put my glass into.
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:16.860]  From the get go, which is really nice.
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:19.220]  Cause I've had one of my shopmates,
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:20.220]  you know, he's definitely,
[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:22.460]  he's had some ex shopmates, not shopmates anymore.
[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:23.780]  He had some trouble selling his glasses
[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:24.740]  and he's been doing it for two years.
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:27.060]  And he's like, you know, he struggled selling cases.
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:28.700]  And I'm here like two months in,
[02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:30.980]  I was flipping mini tubes out the door.
[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:33.660]  And he just, yeah, it's just a lot of
[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:35.460]  getting networking and marketing for sure.
[02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:37.340]  I got to hit one of your mini tube banger hangers
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:38.180]  the other day.
[02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:39.020]  It hits very well.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:39.860]  Yeah, good work.
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:40.700]  I appreciate it, you had little shredders.
[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:41.540]  Yeah, one of the first ones you made I think.
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:42.940]  Yeah, the one I gave Mike over there.
[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:44.540]  Big shout out to Mike.
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:45.380]  What's his new Instagram name?
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:46.220]  He's got a new name on Instagram.
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:48.060]  I think he's team Weedon 710 now.
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:48.940]  Yeah, check him out you guys.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.980]  Team Weedon 710, that's our buddy, big Mike.
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:51.820]  He's a good dude.
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:53.020]  Make sure you follow him on Instagram.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:55.540]  Shout out to the whole Garden of Weedon crew.
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:56.740]  Through team Weedon I made,
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:58.260]  yeah, that's a nice shirt bro, I like that.
[02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:00.140]  Through team Weedon I made so many good friends.
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:00.980]  Oh yeah.
[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:02.100]  So much family.
[02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:03.460]  I mean, that's how I met you, down here.
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:04.300]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:06.060]  Nice, nice.
[02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:09.460]  All right guys, we've been going for over 30 minutes now.
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:11.020]  Dude, thank you for taking some time out of your day
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:11.980]  to come hang out.
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:12.900]  Let's start wrapping this up
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:14.820]  and then we're gonna take some dabs you guys.
[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:16.380]  Before we go, let's give some shout outs
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:18.780]  and talk about some of my favorite glass blowers.
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:21.500]  I don't buy it, I like to look at it.
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:22.420]  Let me be clear about that.
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:25.300]  I don't pay the money, but I do appreciate the art.
[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:27.660]  Coil, coil condenser.
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:28.500]  Holy shit.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:29.940]  He is definitely one of my favorites.
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:32.660]  There's his monkeys and his little bananas
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:33.540]  and that whole little series.
[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:34.980]  It's just very, very cool.
[02:26:34.980 --> 02:26:36.740]  Very, I don't wanna say simplistic,
[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:39.300]  but some of the more simplistic stuff that he does
[02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:40.500]  is some of my favorite stuff.
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:41.340]  It's awesome.
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:43.020]  Also, if you're into that simplistic shit,
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:45.260]  if you like that real, it's real stylish,
[02:26:45.260 --> 02:26:47.340]  but real simple, SD Rhino or Rhino.
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:48.180]  Rhino dude, he killed it.
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:50.300]  He's one of my favorites too, definitely.
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:52.060]  Check out coil condenser on Instagram.
[02:26:52.060 --> 02:26:54.660]  Check out SD, it's at SD Rhino on Instagram.
[02:26:54.660 --> 02:26:56.900]  One of my favorites and also Bertone.
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:26:58.260]  Bertone, there you go.
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:26:59.100]  Yeah, I like this.
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:26:59.940]  Laurel Hustler.
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:01.660]  Yeah, you can tell I like that real bold color,
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:02.540]  real thick work.
[02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:03.660]  That's the kind of stuff that I like.
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:05.660]  And of course there's Darby Holm and people like that.
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:07.060]  That's really appreciate.
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:08.140]  So I'm gonna go back down this list.
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:10.660]  We gotta give a shout out to Mongrel Glass.
[02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:11.700]  Is there's Mongrel, at Mongrel?
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:13.420]  I think it's Mongrel Glass on Instagram.
[02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:14.260]  All right. Mongrel Glass on Instagram.
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:15.100]  There you go.
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:16.500]  And then Combo.
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:18.420]  Is it just Combo or there are underscores in there?
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:19.620]  As far as I know, it's just Combo.
[02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:20.460]  I think it is.
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:22.020]  And then Whitey Glass.
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:23.260]  And then if we're gonna talk about glass,
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:26.420]  you guys make sure you check out Hitman Glass Dougie.
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:27.340]  Support Hitman Glass.
[02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:29.060]  Those are some homies of mine.
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:34.060]  Berserker, Blitzkrieg, Yushin, Elbow, Salt,
[02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:35.740]  and of course Bobby Snodgrass.
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:37.780]  You guys check out Bob Snodgrass.
[02:27:37.780 --> 02:27:39.220]  Bob Snodgrass started it all.
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:40.180]  If you wanna blow glass,
[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:41.660]  if you wanna be a glass blower,
[02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:45.140]  you need to go check out anything to do with Bob Snodgrass.
[02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:47.100]  Make sure you check out the movie.
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:48.460]  The name is leaving my head right now.
[02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:49.300]  Degenerate Art.
[02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:50.140]  Degenerate Art.
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:50.980]  See, I knew that.
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:52.020]  I wanted to say Boral Hustler for some reason,
[02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:53.620]  but I knew that that was not it.
[02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:54.460]  I was like, what?
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:55.860]  You should also check out the Pipe Classic movies
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:56.860]  on YouTube too.
[02:27:56.860 --> 02:27:58.500]  Pipe Classic on YouTube, you guys.
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:27:59.580]  Yeah, Pipe Classics.
[02:27:59.580 --> 02:28:01.260]  Is there a good YouTube channel
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:03.780]  or a way for people to go learn how to blow glass?
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:06.140]  There's a great one, Revere Glass on Instagram.
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:07.740]  Oh, no, sorry, on YouTube.
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:09.300]  They have a whole channel
[02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:10.700]  and that is how I got my start into it.
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.500]  That's how most people these days are getting started
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:15.620]  because they have like 50 something videos
[02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:17.780]  and each one's a little how-to video
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:20.620]  to do a different little technique or something.
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:23.460]  And they're pretty cool dudes, Dustin Revere and Kevin Foote.
[02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:25.060]  I've actually heard of the channel.
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:26.420]  I didn't realize that that's what they did.
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:27.780]  Yeah, they have a couple of different little things
[02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:28.620]  they do on there.
[02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:29.460]  It's pretty cool.
[02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:30.300]  Big shout out.
[02:28:30.300 --> 02:28:31.140]  Thanks to those guys for teaching people
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:31.980]  all the shit that they know
[02:28:31.980 --> 02:28:33.100]  because that is a huge art.
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:33.940]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:35.180]  I wanna give a big shout out to somebody
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:36.020]  who will never hear this,
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:37.020]  but my buddy Ian,
[02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:39.140]  I'm not even gonna say his real name,
[02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:40.820]  but he's Ian, he's a glass blower.
[02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:41.660]  He's not on Instagram.
[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:42.500]  He's not even like that.
[02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:43.980]  He's kinda, he doesn't want notoriety.
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:46.380]  He just wants to make glass and be a glass artist.
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:48.940]  But that dude tried to teach me how to blow glass
[02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:50.380]  and it wasn't his fault that I couldn't learn.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:51.980]  It was totally my fault.
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:53.140]  I'm good at several things
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:55.940]  and blowing glass is definitely not one of them.
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:57.920]  I got a fiber optic burn.
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:28:58.860]  I burned my foot.
[02:28:58.860 --> 02:29:00.420]  I don't know how I burned my foot.
[02:29:00.420 --> 02:29:01.660]  I don't know what burned me,
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:03.420]  but something burned my damn foot.
[02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:05.860]  I am not meant to blow glass.
[02:29:05.860 --> 02:29:07.140]  Shout out to all the people that can
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:08.780]  and shout out to Ian for trying to teach me
[02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:10.380]  and shout out to the raging glass crew
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:12.980]  that tried to tolerate my dumb ass in their studio
[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:14.340]  for a couple of nights.
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:15.420]  It only took me like two attempts
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:17.340]  to realize this is not for me.
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:18.180]  That's funny.
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:19.000]  Yeah, it's hot.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:19.840]  You guys, if you wanna blow glass,
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:21.060]  you better be prepared for some heat.
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:21.900]  Yeah.
[02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:22.740]  Yeah.
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:23.560]  And you gotta get in that fire.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:24.400]  Yep.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:25.240]  You gotta just get in there.
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:26.140]  You gotta get just, there's no,
[02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:27.620]  you can't hesitate, no stopping.
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:28.460]  You just gotta keep going.
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:29.300]  And keep that shit spinning.
[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:30.140]  Keep it spinning, keep it moving.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:31.060]  Your fingers get sweaty.
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:31.900]  Keep it hot.
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.420]  Oh my, yeah, it's not so much respect.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:35.260]  I understand why glass is so expensive.
[02:29:35.260 --> 02:29:36.100]  Mm-hmm.
[02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:36.940]  To an extent.
[02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:37.760]  Yeah.
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:38.600]  To an extent.
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:40.260]  And the work itself is expensive too.
[02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:41.080]  That's a big thing that people,
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:42.200]  I think a lot of people don't think about
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:44.600]  is sometimes you can get a rod of slime,
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:46.600]  like just a couple ounces of slime,
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.000]  just a single little color rod,
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.760]  can cost like 15 bucks for just a little rod.
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:51.600]  Oh shit, okay.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:52.420]  Yeah.
[02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:53.260]  And then how many,
[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:54.160]  I know they break in the kiln sometimes
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:55.000]  when you make a rig.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:55.840]  Oh, that sucks.
[02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:57.680]  So how many, what percentage of your work
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.760]  will break in the kiln?
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.120]  You know, on a good day,
[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:03.520]  like I'll get like 20% breakage,
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:06.200]  but on an average day, it's like 50%.
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:07.040]  Oh shit.
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:07.920]  So it'll just be like,
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:08.880]  not necessarily in the kiln,
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:10.560]  but it'll break while I'm making it
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:12.040]  or a piece of it will break,
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:12.920]  I'll have to make a new piece,
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:13.880]  like my base will break
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:16.120]  because acute angles will kill you.
[02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:17.600]  If you have an acute angle on glass,
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:19.800]  when it cools down, it cracks.
[02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:21.800]  If the seal's not perfect, there's air pockets.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:24.320]  There's just so many little, little things that go into it.
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:25.160]  All right.
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:26.120]  If it cools down quicker than one piece,
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:27.560]  if it's too thick, it's crazy.
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:29.160]  Those little details are the things
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:31.680]  that the china glass are not gonna pay attention to, right?
[02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:32.520]  Yes, exactly.
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:33.340]  The seals.
[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:34.180]  They're seals, they don't anneal.
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:35.000]  They're making sure that your perks work.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:35.960]  Exactly, they don't have proper anneal cycles,
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:37.040]  they don't use proper seals.
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:39.000]  So you could, you know, some of their seals,
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.880]  you could just push it with your thumb and it'll fall off.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:41.720]  Oh shit.
[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:42.540]  Yeah.
[02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:43.380]  I don't wanna do that.
[02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:44.200]  No, not at all.
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:45.040]  All right, buy American Glass, you guys.
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:45.880]  If you can. Please.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:46.700]  Support American Glass.
[02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:48.560]  If you can support a local artist, support a local artist.
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:51.160]  I know I buy Hitman Glass, but there's a reason for that.
[02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:52.680]  Dougie is my homie.
[02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:53.600]  They kind of support what I do.
[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:54.840]  I support what they do.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:55.920]  And they support the community.
[02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:56.760]  Yes.
[02:30:56.760 --> 02:30:58.160]  He puts back in the community, so.
[02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:59.000]  Yeah, he does.
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:30:59.960]  Support the Chalice Fest.
[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.780]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:02.200]  No one's paid me to say that, but support Chalice Fest.
[02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:03.640]  It's gonna be freaking huge this year.
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:04.560]  It's gonna be awesome.
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:05.960]  Shout out to Doug for everything he's been doing
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:06.800]  for the community.
[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:07.640]  I love it.
[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:08.460]  I support it.
[02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:09.300]  Doug supports us.
[02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:10.140]  It's awesome, dude.
[02:31:10.140 --> 02:31:10.960]  Cool.
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:11.800]  Ah, man.
[02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:12.640]  So let's wrap up the show.
[02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:13.560]  Dude, I wanna thank you again for coming.
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:15.080]  Do you have anybody you wanna give a shout out to?
[02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:17.080]  Anything you wanna say while you're being recorded
[02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:18.520]  and being put on the world?
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:23.920]  Sloppy told me to tell you to give his mom a hug.
[02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:24.840]  Or give your mom a hug.
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:25.680]  Something like that.
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.880]  So there's that for Sloppy.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:28.640]  He said, he told me to tell you that one.
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:29.720]  Big shout out to Sloppy.
[02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:30.560]  What up, big homie?
[02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:31.640]  Come be back on the podcast, bro.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:35.160]  Make sure you guys follow Oil Olympian Glass Arts
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:37.280]  on Facebook and Instagram.
[02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:38.120]  Nice.
[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:42.520]  Sloppy is now taking a business venture in the glass game.
[02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:43.360]  So if you need some-
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:44.180]  Doing quite well, too.
[02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:46.200]  He's got a solid little bit of headies for sale.
[02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:47.040]  Nice.
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:47.880]  Yeah.
[02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:48.700]  So if you need some new glass, you guys,
[02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:49.540]  check out our buddy Slop.
[02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:50.360]  Support the community.
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:51.200]  Definitely.
[02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:52.040]  Tell him that you heard about him
[02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:52.960]  through the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:55.600]  and see if I can earn some commission or something on that.
[02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:56.440]  What up, Slop?
[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:58.040]  Hook a brother up.
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:31:59.360]  Yeah, but shout out to,
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:01.200]  I guess I'll give a shout out to my buddy Blake,
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:03.240]  staycheesyglass on Instagram.
[02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:04.480]  He's been a huge, huge help
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:05.560]  ever since I started blowing glass.
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:07.000]  Guess I should have talked about him earlier,
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.160]  but he's taught me a good bit
[02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:10.600]  ever since I got into the studio here in Pueblo.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:11.420]  Nice.
[02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:12.260]  Big shout out, Blake.
[02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:13.080]  I met you at Champs.
[02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:13.920]  You seem like a cool bro.
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:14.760]  I wish you could have been here,
[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:15.880]  but it sounds like you're having fun anyway.
[02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:16.720]  He's doing some fun shit.
[02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:17.560]  Enjoy that.
[02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:18.380]  Yeah.
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:19.220]  Enjoy that.
[02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:20.440]  I heard all about what you're doing, bro.
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:21.280]  I heard it.
[02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:22.100]  I love it.
[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:22.940]  Awesome.
[02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:23.760]  All right, man.
[02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:24.800]  Well, dude, thanks a lot for coming to talk about glass.
[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:25.720]  Next time we'll get you on,
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:27.920]  and maybe you'll be able to tell us a little bit
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:29.200]  about how to blow glass.
[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:30.040]  Yeah, definitely, man.
[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.440]  When I adapt, I'd love to do that.
[02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:32.280]  Nice, nice.
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:33.320]  You heard it from him, you guys.
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.700]  So we'll get him back here in a couple of weeks.
[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:36.600]  We'll set up another podcast here in two or three weeks.
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:38.560]  We'll have him come talk about how to blow glass.
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:39.720]  Just 30 minutes basics.
[02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.120]  You know, we're not gonna get too in-depth.
[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:43.240]  You guys, if you burn yourselves, I'm not responsible.
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:44.400]  Either is well.
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.240]  Either is well.
[02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:46.120]  Just make sure you know that shit.
[02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:47.480]  Get the burn cream out.
[02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:48.320]  Get a fire extinguisher.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:49.140]  Some aloe.
[02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:49.980]  Some aloe, there you go.
[02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:52.200]  A chef told me to rub mustard on it.
[02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:53.640]  That, I guess that would work.
[02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:54.480]  Yeah, sure.
[02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:56.160]  Maybe it's just a, what's that called?
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.640]  A fucking placebo effect?
[02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:59.440]  If you think it works, then it works.
[02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:00.480]  Fuck it, if it works, it works.
[02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:01.320]  There you go.
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:02.560]  Rub some mustard on it, you guys.
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:04.380]  I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:06.360]  Make sure you support all of the social media stuff.
[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:09.120]  Make sure you find me on Instagram under Ireadgenetics.
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:11.280]  Make sure you follow at Barefoot Glass.
[02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:13.200]  Guys, if you wanna see a whole bunch of great glass,
[02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:14.760]  go follow all the people I mentioned before.
[02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:15.920]  I'm sure I said it several times.
[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:18.040]  You're probably done hearing it.
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:20.800]  I'm not gonna read all that stuff that I normally read
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:22.600]  because you're probably tired of hearing it
[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:24.840]  and you probably know it all by now.
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:26.800]  So I'm just gonna wrap it up like this, you guys.
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:27.760]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:29.880]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:31.200]  Shout out to my guests for joining me.
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.120]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.740]  and give your mom a hug for me.

[02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:06.780]  coming to you with episode number 106 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:10.780]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:13.780]  You guys, I'm coming to you with another show from the car.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:17.780]  You guys, I've been traveling back and forth between Colorado Springs and Pueblo quite a bit lately,
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:21.780]  and it's an hour drive each direction, so I have had a lot of time to think,
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:23.780]  and I have definitely had some time to do some recording.
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:26.780]  So here I am on the microphone, traveling on the interstate.
[02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:31.780]  It is Wednesday, November 18th. I plan on putting this episode out on Thursday the 19th,
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:35.780]  so this is just going to be a bonus episode, and I hope you guys enjoy it.
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:38.780]  I want to make a very special announcement while I'm here.
[02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:44.780]  You guys, as of yesterday, around noon, I am no longer involved with the Spot Dispensary.
[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:47.780]  I have severed all ties with the Spot Dispensary. I am not employed by them,
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:52.780]  I am not affiliated with them, and I am not advertising for the spot in any way any longer.
[02:37:52.780 --> 02:37:55.780]  So I want to say goodbye to the Spot Dispensary.
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:59.780]  I don't work there anymore. It was fun, but I've got to do other things with myself.
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:04.780]  I have no hard feelings or ill will or any hatred or anything toward the spot.
[02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:10.780]  I just need to move on. Sometimes there are other options in life that you need to follow or need to pursue,
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:12.780]  and that's what I'm going to do with myself.
[02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:17.780]  So that being said, let me make one more huge announcement.
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:26.780]  As of today, around noon, I am officially the lead cultivator at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:30.780]  That's right, you guys. I quit a job yesterday, and I've got a new job today.
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:36.780]  So big shout out to Hunt and the Grammy Gatsby and the Green and Healthy Wellness crew.
[02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:41.780]  A few weeks ago, it was about two weeks ago, when the owner of Green and Healthy Wellness gave me a call,
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:46.780]  and he said, hey bro, do you know anybody that would be qualified to run a large grow?
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:50.780]  And I said, yeah, what do you need? And he gave me a nice description of the job,
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:52.780]  and he told me what would be required.
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:55.780]  And I said, you know, I think I want that job.
[02:38:55.780 --> 02:38:59.780]  And he was like, no way. And I was like, no, for real, I want the job because I'm not happy with what I'm doing.
[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:02.780]  So we talked about it for a couple of weeks. I drove up and checked out the grow.
[02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:05.780]  I've spent a lot of time in the grow. I've spent a lot of time with the crew.
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:08.780]  And it is a go, you guys. This is where I need to be.
[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:14.780]  I need to be working at Green and Healthy Wellness with Hunt, with Damsel, with Randall's.
[02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:18.780]  I need to be there. It's part of the team. So Team Dreadlocks is getting a little bit stronger.
[02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:24.780]  Shout out to Green and Healthy Wellness for having faith in me and giving me the opportunity to be the lead grower, you guys.
[02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:29.780]  I'm going to be the one producing all of the medicine for their medical marijuana shop in Colorado Springs.
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:38.780]  So if you're a medical patient, look forward to, we should have a harvest coming down mid-February-ish is what I have planned in my vision.
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:51.780]  So around March, around March 1st to St. Patrick's Day-ish, we should have some Rasta Jeff grown flowers available for the medical patients at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:56.780]  Now I want to kind of elaborate here, you guys. I want to let you know why I quit the spot and let you know what's going on.
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:00.780]  Because I don't want you to think that I hate the spot or that anything shitty happened.
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:07.780]  I've been at the spot since the middle of July. And we have been building and getting things finalized.
[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:12.780]  And there is no sign of having plants in that building for at least another month or two.
[02:40:12.780 --> 02:40:18.780]  And I am not a plumber. I'm not a construction worker. I can do basic things.
[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:23.780]  But I've been trying to find stuff to keep me busy for 40 hours a week in the spot for the past month.
[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:28.780]  And there's nothing to do. And without plants in there, I've been going crazy, you guys.
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:31.780]  The building is not ready for plants. They're not ready to cultivate.
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:38.780]  I was expected to be there and perform. So it was hard to be there every day with nothing to do.
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:44.780]  It was making me super anxious. I was making me bored. I was spending way too much time on social media because I was bored at the shop.
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:53.780]  So when my buddy Hunt called and said, hey, we need help here at Green and Healthy, it felt like the right thing to do to jump on and be part of the team.
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:41:00.780]  At this spot, they run hydro. It's a big, huge hydro setup. I am not a hydro grower. I am a soil farmer.
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:09.780]  At the Green and Healthy grow, we're running three-gallon pots of soilless mix with plants already in the building.
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:18.780]  There are plants there waiting for me. So Friday, I'm going to move plants to the flowering room and I'm going to give them a little bit of time to veg in the flower room in their new home.
[02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:23.780]  And about 10 to 14 days after that, I plan to flower the first crop for Green and Healthy Wellness.
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:31.780]  So I'm leaving a facility that will not have plants until my first harvest at my new facility is finished is what it feels like.
[02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:36.780]  And I'm in it to grow, you guys. That's what I'm here for. I want to grow and produce quality cannabis.
[02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:42.780]  So I had to make a move. I had to make a huge move. This is an hour drive to and from work every single day.
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:48.780]  But you know what? It's a soil garden with my homies, the Grimey Gatsby and Duditz Damsel and John Randles Jr.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:51.780]  So in my mind, this is the right decision.
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:56.780]  Sometimes you got to just, you got to make a move that scares you. You got to make a move that puts you on the spot.
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:41:59.780]  You got to make a move that breaks you out of your routine.
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:06.780]  And I feel like my life has really been routine for the past couple of years and shaking myself up like this really puts,
[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:12.780]  it lights a new fire under my ass, so to speak. It puts fresh ideas in my head. I find new inspiration.
[02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:17.780]  I meet new people. I go new places. It really improves my life overall.
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:26.780]  When I put myself in an uncomfortable position, when I break out of my comfort bubble and put myself in a position where I'm not exactly sure how this is going to play out.
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:33.780]  It always works very well for myself. So if you guys are scared to do something, if there's something you're thinking about doing,
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:38.780]  if there's a big change in your life that you're thinking about making, all I can say is grab your balls and do it.
[02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:45.780]  Just do it. Don't be afraid. Success is scary. But once you succeed and you see what it's like to succeed and not fall down from that,
[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:49.780]  all you're going to do is want to succeed more and more and more. Your goals are going to get bigger.
[02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:55.780]  Your dreams are going to get bigger. Your abilities to reach those dreams will get bigger right alongside all of that.
[02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:59.780]  So if you're afraid of something, don't be scared, you guys. You can fucking do it.
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:03.780]  And what's going to happen? You're going to try and you're either going to succeed or you're going to fail.
[02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:09.780]  If you fail, you're going to be right where you are. You're not going to go backwards by failing because trying something is going to give you skills.
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:15.780]  You're going to at least be trying something. You're going to feel better. And if you succeed, holy shit, you just succeeded at something.
[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:20.780]  You just opened a new door to your life. You just have a new thing you can do or somewhere else you can go.
[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:26.780]  And what is that going to do? That's going to be a building block for the next places you can go and the next things you can do.
[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:34.780]  So if you're scared, if you're stuck in your comfort zone, if you're stuck in your little bubble, you guys, all I can say is step out of that and try to do some new things.
[02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:38.780]  Have some faith in the world. Have some faith in yourself. Have some faith in life.
[02:43:38.780 --> 02:43:42.780]  Even if you're not a spiritual or a religious person, you can have some confidence.
[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:49.780]  You can have some, I guess, faith is what you need to have and don't have fear of failing.
[02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:55.780]  If your life is good right now and you try something and you fail, you're still going to have the life you've got.
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:59.780]  Nobody's going to take it away from you because you messed up trying something new.
[02:43:59.780 --> 02:44:05.780]  And anybody that does talk shit to you and disrespects you because you tried something new and you failed, they are not your friend.
[02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:07.780]  Your friends are going to support you through your failures.
[02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:14.780]  Your friends are going to say, man, that looks like a challenging task to try to do and I'm proud of you just for getting off your ass and trying it.
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:19.780]  Because 75% of the people that are out there wouldn't even have gotten off their asses to attempt what you just failed at.
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:22.780]  So don't be afraid to fail. You got to try some shit, you guys.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:26.780]  I guess that's my inspirational talk for the day. That was my announcement for the day.
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:31.780]  I am driving down I-25 on a beautiful damn Wednesday. It is so gorgeous out here.
[02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:37.780]  There's not a cloud in the sky. I can see for a hundred miles. I can see Pikes Peak. I can see the wet mountains.
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:42.780]  It is such a gorgeous day. So guys, get outside, suck up some sunshine. The winter is coming.
[02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:47.780]  We should talk about how to prepare your growth for the winter, I guess, pretty soon here.
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:49.780]  So that's some good shit to talk about.
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:52.780]  You guys, I'm getting out of here. I feel like I'm rambling into this microphone.
[02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:56.780]  I hope everybody has a wonderful day. Smoke some great cannabis. Smoke some good hash.
[02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:58.780]  Love one another. Don't be afraid to reach your goals.
[02:44:58.780 --> 02:45:02.780]  And until next time, you guys, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:14.320]  Summer time, we get them when they got symptoms.
[02:47:28.770 --> 02:47:33.770]  Lord, I got the drugs and where they never know when I'm.
[02:47:34.770 --> 02:47:37.770]  Oh, Lord, I got the drugs and where they never know when I'm.
[02:47:37.770 --> 02:47:44.380]  Oh, Lord, I got the drugs and where they never know when I'm.
[02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:49.380]  I wish I could scoop them up when I smoke them, but no way.
[02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:51.380]  You just made me scoop them up, baby.
[02:47:51.380 --> 02:47:52.380]  Hey!
[02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:56.060]  Ayy!

[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:37.080]  Ayy!
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:38.080]  Ayy!
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:42.420]  If you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:44.420]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:46.580]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:48.300]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:51.500]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:52.500]  band.
[02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:55.340]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:56.340]  What's up everybody?
[02:48:56.340 --> 02:48:59.340]  I hope you guys are having a wonderful evening, a wonderful morning, a wonderful afternoon,
[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:02.220]  whatever time it is, no matter what, no matter where you are, no matter what you're doing,
[02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:03.380]  I hope you're smoking something tasty.
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:04.380]  I hope you got a fat dab.
[02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:05.380]  I hope you got a joint rolled.
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:07.420]  I hope you got something like that going on.
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:09.340]  We're coming to you on November 19th.
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:12.220]  Sitting across the table from me, joining us again is our good buddy, White Mike.
[02:49:12.220 --> 02:49:13.220]  How you doing today, bro?
[02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:14.220]  Doing all right.
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:15.220]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:16.220]  Doing good, man.
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:17.220]  Doing good.
[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:18.220]  Thanks for asking.
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:19.220]  I'm going to point this microphone a little more at your face.
[02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:20.220]  There you go.
[02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:21.220]  Just get the words into it a little more.
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:22.220]  Get back in our rhythm.
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:23.220]  Yes, yes.
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:24.220]  I'm going to drop this music out a little bit and we will get down to business.
[02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:25.220]  How you doing today, bro?
[02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:26.220]  Doing all right.
[02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:27.220]  Right on, man.
[02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:28.220]  Thanks for coming.
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:30.020]  Thanks for taking time away from the new youngster to come see me.
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:31.020]  Yep.
[02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:33.780]  He's sleeping right now, so I get some away time.
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:36.900]  I hear he's had a little head cold, so I hope the little dude gets better really soon.
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:37.900]  Yeah, he's on the mend.
[02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:38.900]  I hope he didn't share it with everybody.
[02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:39.900]  Nope.
[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:40.900]  Not yet, but we can feel it coming.
[02:49:40.900 --> 02:49:41.900]  Oh, gosh.
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:42.900]  All right.
[02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:43.900]  I'm going to take my vitamins.
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:44.900]  You guys, if you're listening, take your vitamins so that you don't catch Mike's skits cold.
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:45.900]  Take your vitamins, people.
[02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:46.900]  Take your vitamins.
[02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:47.900]  Take some emergency.
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:48.900]  Wait, nobody pays me.
[02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:49.900]  Just take whatever vitamins you take.
[02:49:49.900 --> 02:49:50.900]  Take those.
[02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:51.900]  Yeah.
[02:49:51.900 --> 02:49:52.900]  If you have a vitamin company that would like to sponsor a podcast, you know how to find
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:53.900]  me.
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:54.900]  Shout out to not getting sick.
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:49:55.900]  Yes.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:56.900]  Shout out to good health, you guys.
[02:49:56.900 --> 02:49:57.900]  Take good care of yourself.
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:49:58.900]  Make sure you hydrate.
[02:49:58.900 --> 02:50:05.020]  If you're dabbing and smoking a bunch of cannabis or a bunch of hash or eating edibles or whatever
[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:06.380]  you're doing, you need to hydrate.
[02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:07.380]  Drink more water.
[02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:08.980]  Most of us are dehydrated anyway.
[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:09.980]  Skip that soda.
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:10.980]  Drink a bottle of water.
[02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:11.980]  I know it sounds crazy.
[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:12.980]  It's ludicrous.
[02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:13.980]  But hydrate.
[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:14.980]  It's good for you.
[02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:15.980]  It's really good for you.
[02:50:15.980 --> 02:50:16.980]  All right.
[02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:18.340]  You guys, I need to mention something.
[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:22.700]  I put out an episode, number 106, went up on Stitcher on Thursday.
[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:25.320]  It actually went up today, Thursday the 19th.
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:27.900]  And for some reason, Stitcher is failing on picking it up.
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:30.180]  It's only got one second of the show posted.
[02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:33.660]  So I've emailed Stitcher and let them know that there is an issue.
[02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:35.740]  Usually Stitcher just goes and corrects it really quickly.
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:37.900]  The show is available on iTunes.
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:42.500]  It's available on my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:44.980]  For some reason, it did not work on Stitcher.
[02:50:44.980 --> 02:50:47.560]  It's Stitcher's problem, I can tell, because it's playing on my iPhone.
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:48.560]  It's playing on my computer.
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:50.980]  It just will not play through Stitcher.
[02:50:50.980 --> 02:50:52.060]  So I apologize.
[02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:56.540]  If you guys did not get to hear episode 106, I made a very special and a very important
[02:50:56.540 --> 02:50:57.540]  announcement.
[02:50:58.180 --> 02:51:00.180]  I recorded the podcast from my car while I was driving.
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:01.180]  So it's one of those.
[02:51:01.180 --> 02:51:02.460]  And you do want to listen to it.
[02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:06.740]  So if you're a Stitcher listener and you have not gotten to hear episode number 106 with
[02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:12.340]  a very special announcement, I encourage you to either go to my website or go to iTunes
[02:51:12.340 --> 02:51:14.180]  and check out episode number 106.
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:16.600]  It's iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:20.540]  Click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab and it'll be right there, number 106, very
[02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:21.540]  special announcement.
[02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:22.540]  Give that a listen.
[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:25.180]  I think you will appreciate what I had to say.
[02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:27.500]  I do apologize for Stitcher not picking up the episode.
[02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:28.500]  I've emailed them.
[02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:30.620]  I just got to wait for them to fix it.
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:32.260]  That's pretty much what we can do.
[02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:34.860]  All right, I got to reach for my phone.
[02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:37.940]  I've got one more thing I want to talk about before we start getting down to the heart
[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:38.940]  of the show.
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:40.980]  I'm going to unlock the phone here, you guys.
[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:43.980]  I got a screenshot of something.
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:46.620]  So we put a lot of work into this podcast.
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:47.620]  I take time out of my day.
[02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:48.620]  I take time out of my life.
[02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:51.420]  Mike takes time away from his family to come over here and record.
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:53.820]  Mike works 40 something hours a week in the spot.
[02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:56.860]  So getting him to come over for an hour is actually a little effort.
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:52:00.940]  I got an email that makes all of our time, all of our effort worthwhile.
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:03.900]  These are the emails that really make it worth putting in the energy.
[02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:07.060]  So this came from somebody, we'll just call him Mike O.
[02:52:07.060 --> 02:52:09.580]  And he says, the podcast is great.
[02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:12.260]  Best show I've listened, best show and I've listened to them all.
[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:15.780]  Hoping you will do more shows with longer content like the earlier episodes.
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:19.860]  I would like to see a pest management episode and more BHO shows.
[02:52:19.860 --> 02:52:23.620]  I'm in Michigan and took a 10 year hiatus from growing after cloning the shit out of
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:26.980]  a super skunk seed smuggled back from Amsterdam in 93.
[02:52:26.980 --> 02:52:29.060]  Shit sure changed since 04.
[02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:31.940]  Had to learn about, he lists a bunch of stuff he had to learn about.
[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:35.540]  And then he keeps it going for a minute and he says, I've listened to all the grow shows.
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:37.380]  Adam Dunn, Dude Grows, Kyle Cushman.
[02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:39.500]  And then he says, yours is the best by far.
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:43.980]  Great mix of knowledge, humor and irreverence in a very easy to listen to style.
[02:52:43.980 --> 02:52:47.860]  I'm almost done re-listening to the entire series again.
[02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:48.940]  Great job, brother man.
[02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:50.180]  I'll do a dab for you.
[02:52:50.180 --> 02:52:52.060]  Signed, Mike.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:52.900]  Dude.
[02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:53.900]  Thanks Mike.
[02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:54.900]  That's awesome.
[02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:55.900]  That is awesome.
[02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:56.900]  He says we are the best podcast.
[02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:00.540]  I'm not trying to compete with anybody, but if I'm being called the best, then that is
[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:01.540]  fucking awesome.
[02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:02.540]  I appreciate that, Mike.
[02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:05.180]  Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:06.540]  The email is turned off over here.
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:08.220]  This email coil needs to be replaced.
[02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:11.300]  But when we do a dab, the next step that we do is for Mike.
[02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:14.540]  And I've got, I get plenty of emails like that, but it was time to read one on the air
[02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:15.980]  and say, dude, check this out.
[02:53:15.980 --> 02:53:16.980]  This is what comes.
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:21.420]  I probably get an email or a text message or an Instagram message or a Facebook message
[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:23.540]  once a day saying thanks for the podcast.
[02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:28.380]  So that kind of stuff makes it all worth the time and energy and effort that we do to put
[02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:29.380]  in this podcast.
[02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:30.380]  Thank you guys for listening.
[02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:31.380]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:32.380]  Thanks for the email.
[02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:33.380]  If you want to send me an email, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:36.240]  I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:40.060]  What I would really appreciate is if you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search
[02:53:40.060 --> 02:53:44.620]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, find the review section, give me a five-star review
[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:46.940]  and type in a comment, let me know what you think of the show.
[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:47.940]  That would be really cool.
[02:53:47.940 --> 02:53:52.460]  What that does is moves us up in the ranks in iTunes and that exposes us to more listeners
[02:53:52.460 --> 02:53:55.660]  and then more listeners will grow better ganja.
[02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:58.000]  More people will help us liberate cannabis.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  It's a good thing.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.000]  So give me a little review.
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  Let me know what you think.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:02.000]  I would appreciate that.
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  I'm going to sneeze.
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.100]  Oh, it didn't happen.
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:05.820]  We talked about it and scared it away.
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:06.820]  All right.
[02:54:06.820 --> 02:54:09.500]  So we do have a real topic we want to talk about here, but I want to talk about one more
[02:54:09.500 --> 02:54:13.820]  thing since Mike is a little familiar with this region of life.
[02:54:13.820 --> 02:54:20.700]  I got the privilege on Monday morning of going to jury duty at 8 a.m. on a cold ass
[02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:21.700]  Monday.
[02:54:21.700 --> 02:54:22.700]  Yup.
[02:54:22.700 --> 02:54:24.740]  I got lucky the last time I had to do it was during the summer.
[02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:25.740]  At least I wasn't cold.
[02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:26.740]  Right.
[02:54:26.740 --> 02:54:27.740]  Yeah.
[02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:30.860]  You got to be there bright and early and it's fucking cold and it was so windy.
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:32.660]  It was one of the windiest days of the year.
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:33.660]  It was crazy.
[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:34.660]  Yeah.
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:36.100]  You had jury duty on a really nasty day.
[02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:37.100]  Yeah.
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:42.380]  It was weird because the courtroom has skylight sort of windows that are kind of tinted behind
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:47.940]  the judge and they were changing from black to baby blue to black to baby blue with the
[02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:49.340]  weather every like 10 minutes.
[02:54:49.340 --> 02:54:51.500]  I was like, holy shit, what's going on outside?
[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:52.940]  That was crazy.
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:55.580]  So I had jury duty and obviously I was not selected.
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:57.900]  I am never selected to be a part of the jury.
[02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:02.580]  I get down to when they start asking questions and then like, oh, you can go home.
[02:55:02.580 --> 02:55:07.500]  But I went in there with a certain thing in mind of what I was going to see and experience
[02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:09.700]  and how I was going to handle shit.
[02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:11.700]  And it was nothing like what I expected.
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:14.980]  No, it's not at all like it appears on television.
[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:15.980]  Exactly.
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:20.540]  And the chairs are just as uncomfortable as they appear on television, if not significantly
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:21.540]  more so.
[02:55:21.540 --> 02:55:23.020]  But other than that, very few similarities.
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:28.300]  It was like they were mad at us and made us sit in shitty church pews.
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:31.940]  When you're in them, it feels like it was designed to punish everyone that was selected
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:32.940]  significantly.
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:33.940]  Yes.
[02:55:33.940 --> 02:55:37.900]  So the thing that stood out the most to me, I'm afraid of judges.
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:42.980]  Straight up, a judge can say you are going to jail and you get to do some time in jail.
[02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:47.340]  You get to go get butt poked for a little bit and there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:52.180]  The judge that resided over that courtroom was cool as fuck.
[02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:57.180]  Like I don't know the judge personally, but he presented himself fairly.
[02:55:57.180 --> 02:56:00.860]  I didn't feel like he was passing judgment on anybody by the way they looked.
[02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:05.580]  He treated the guys in suits and the lady in her sweatpants exactly the same.
[02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:06.580]  He was kind to everybody.
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:09.820]  He was respectful and he was a human about things.
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:14.060]  I figured it was going to be rigorous and everything would be on a certain time schedule
[02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:15.060]  and stuff.
[02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:17.380]  And he went for a little bit of time and he goes, does anybody need to use the restroom
[02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:18.380]  or anything?
[02:56:18.380 --> 02:56:19.380]  Can we wait another 15 minutes?
[02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:20.940]  And everyone's like, I can wait 15.
[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:22.380]  And he's like, okay, we'll go in 15 minutes.
[02:56:22.380 --> 02:56:23.380]  You guys don't worry.
[02:56:23.380 --> 02:56:25.300]  And he looked up the clock and he was, oh, sorry, it's been about 20 minutes.
[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:26.460]  You guys, let's go use the restroom.
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:27.460]  We'll take 15.
[02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:31.340]  And he was actually pretty cool.
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:35.060]  At this point, for the most part, it runs like it should.
[02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:41.260]  Like it's much more functional in, I don't know, human than a lot of people assume.
[02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:43.540]  I know judges like I've met many of them.
[02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:44.540]  They're people too.
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:45.540]  And that's what I said.
[02:56:45.540 --> 02:56:47.420]  Mike's a little more in that realm.
[02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:49.580]  Mike has experience in that side of life.
[02:56:49.580 --> 02:56:51.180]  And I, uh, I'm the dreadlock.
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:52.740]  I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:53.740]  I got red eyes.
[02:56:53.740 --> 02:56:57.300]  I smell like cannabis most of the time.
[02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:01.020]  I try to avoid those types of folks, but you know, now that things are changing, I'm going
[02:57:01.700 --> 02:57:03.700]  to have to mingle and rub some elbows with those types of people.
[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:05.500]  But the judge was very fair.
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:06.500]  I did not feel intimidated.
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:07.500]  I didn't feel afraid.
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:09.180]  Uh, it was really cool.
[02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:15.100]  It may have given me a touch of faith in our system, maybe a touch more.
[02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:17.900]  It's nice to know that there's at least humans involved.
[02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:21.580]  Like we're seeing it from just the juror selection part.
[02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:22.940]  They didn't kick us out.
[02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:27.620]  They didn't kick out the rejected jurors until all of the jurors had been chosen so that
[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:30.100]  they knew that there were enough in the pool.
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:34.500]  And I got to watch the selection process and I got to watch all of the jurors be interviewed.
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:39.380]  And then at the end of that, the two, uh, lawyers, the prosecution, the prosecution
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:43.380]  and the defense pass back and forth a piece of paper and they agree on which people are
[02:57:43.380 --> 02:57:44.780]  going to be the jurors.
[02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:45.780]  And I was laughing.
[02:57:45.780 --> 02:57:48.940]  I was like, it's like fantasy football for the lawyers or something.
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:52.180]  And they're like, I'll trade you the angry white guy for the passive white lady.
[02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:53.900]  And like, I could just see him negotiating.
[02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:54.900]  I knew who was going to go home.
[02:57:54.900 --> 02:57:56.500]  I was like, they're going to get rid of that guy.
[02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:58.500]  Like, he's too angry and he's too mad.
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:01.780]  He wants this guy to go to jail before he's even heard the case.
[02:58:01.780 --> 02:58:06.900]  The last two times I went, the first time I got let go before any of that started, even
[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:08.780]  I never even made it to the courtroom.
[02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:13.380]  They called all but like 20 of us and was like, the rest of you can go home.
[02:58:13.380 --> 02:58:14.820]  Like just no ceremony about it.
[02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:16.100]  We didn't have to sign out or nothing.
[02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:17.100]  They didn't care.
[02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:18.580]  The first time I went, that's what happened.
[02:58:18.580 --> 02:58:20.940]  There was a case that we were going to see that day.
[02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:24.820]  And the lady that was supposed to be in that case committed another crime and had been
[02:58:24.820 --> 02:58:28.420]  re-arrested and was going to jail and was going to be retried for all of her shit.
[02:58:28.420 --> 02:58:31.540]  So yeah, she got me out of jury duty that day, but she fucked up her life.
[02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:38.860]  And then the last time they, uh, they got down to like 30 people that they liked and
[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:42.140]  they just waved that the rest of us want to go home.
[02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:46.420]  And so we all got to go home at lunch, which was nice, but I've had friends that have selected
[02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:49.900]  and served on juries and it's a hell of an experience.
[02:58:49.900 --> 02:58:54.040]  You know, since, uh, you guys, if you did not listen to episode number 106, I no longer
[02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:55.040]  work at the spot dispensary.
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:56.280]  I just wanted to put that out there.
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:57.280]  I quit the spot.
[02:58:57.280 --> 02:58:59.240]  I now work at green and healthy wellness in Colorado Springs.
[02:58:59.240 --> 02:59:00.240]  Quick update.
[02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:01.240]  Yeah.
[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:02.240]  Quick update.
[02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:03.240]  Just since 106 may have been unlistenable on some devices.
[02:59:03.240 --> 02:59:04.960]  Um, yeah, I quit the spot guys.
[02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:05.960]  I'm sorry.
[02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:06.960]  I had to do that.
[02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:07.960]  Uh, I work at green and healthy wellness.
[02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:08.960]  I'm now the grower there.
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:09.960]  It's in Colorado Springs.
[02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:10.960]  We're going to crush it.
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:11.960]  Shout out to hunt.
[02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:15.160]  But, uh, I was in jury duty and I'm sitting here thinking, I don't have to work tomorrow.
[02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:16.560]  I ain't got shit to do.
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:18.880]  I wouldn't mind being selected for a case.
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:19.920]  It would have been kind of fun.
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:22.720]  It would have been a very learning experience for myself.
[02:59:22.720 --> 02:59:23.720]  Yeah.
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:27.840]  I hate to imagine it, but now if I'm ever in court, I know how it goes.
[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:28.840]  Yep.
[02:59:28.840 --> 02:59:29.840]  And I've got a little experience.
[02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:31.280]  It's, I'm not going to shit my pants the first time.
[02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:34.800]  Um, I want to invite Mike while he's sitting here in front of me, we'll get a commitment
[02:59:34.800 --> 02:59:35.800]  out of them.
[02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:38.640]  You guys, I want you to come do an episode with me about how to deal with you, how to
[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:40.360]  conduct yourself with law enforcement.
[02:59:40.360 --> 02:59:41.360]  Oh, sure.
[02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:44.200]  Whether you're being pulled over, whether they're coming to your home, whether you're
[02:59:44.200 --> 02:59:49.520]  in public, whether you're at a smoking event, I'd like to get you and, uh, we'll get somebody
[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:50.520]  else on the show too.
[02:59:50.520 --> 02:59:51.520]  I have a good idea of who we're going to get on the show.
[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:52.520]  I have a good idea.
[02:59:53.320 --> 02:59:57.680]  I think we're going to get sloppy and you on the show because that's, that'll, that'll
[02:59:57.680 --> 02:59:59.200]  make for a really interesting show.
[02:59:59.200 --> 03:00:00.200]  That's for sure.
[03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:01.200]  Yes.
[03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:02.200]  Sloppy.
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:03.200]  You're invited.
[03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:05.200]  We got such different experiences with law enforcement.
[03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:06.200]  Yes.
[03:00:06.200 --> 03:00:07.200]  Yeah.
[03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:08.200]  Yeah.
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:09.200]  And I want to get both you guys on the show and we can talk about how to deal.
[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:12.080]  Uh, we'll talk about how to deal with law enforcement and not get your ass thrown in
[03:00:12.080 --> 03:00:13.080]  jail.
[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:14.080]  All right guys.
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:16.840]  So I must've blown a couple of dabs into the computer because as I was saying that part
[03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:19.080]  about the judge, it totally just quit recording here.
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:20.080]  Computer got too high.
[03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:21.560]  The computer is too dabbed out.
[03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:22.600]  Something went wrong.
[03:00:22.600 --> 03:00:26.400]  Uh, that means that we're going to have to start running an auxiliary output from the,
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:32.520]  uh, the USB down here or the mixer into the H six and dual record this bitch in case that
[03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:33.520]  happens again.
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:34.520]  And then I can just keep recording the age.
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:35.520]  Six would have kept going.
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:36.520]  Nice.
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:37.520]  Yeah.
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:41.920]  Or we'll go get a little Roland handheld recorder and use the headphone out on the mixer and
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:45.760]  then just run that into the handheld recorder and that just records onto an SD card.
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:46.760]  So there's no failure.
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:48.120]  The age six would work.
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:49.200]  The handheld would work.
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:51.280]  We'll do something like that as a backup plan.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:55.640]  Or we can just, uh, take a dab when it fails and come back a couple of minutes later and
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:58.080]  explain that we just had a major technical failure here.
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:59.080]  Yeah.
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:00.840]  I like the third option and that seems simplest.
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:01.840]  It's the cheapest.
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:04.640]  Y'all were wondering like what kind of equipment we're doing the show with.
[03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:08.040]  Just got a pile of equipment that's larger than your car.
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:10.200]  Uh, well this is the home setup.
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:14.000]  This is where this is so that you can get the voice like there is a go cast.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  That's what that's for.
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  That's for all this.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:17.760]  But the home base version is pretty elaborate.
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:18.760]  Yeah.
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:19.760]  Yeah.
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:21.760]  I mean, I think it's the size of a big cell phone basically.
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  Yeah.
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:25.040]  When you hear me recording in the car, it's the cell phone.
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:26.040]  Maybe.
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:27.040]  Yeah.
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:28.040]  Zach Morris's older cell phone.
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:29.040]  That's the truth.
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:30.520]  We just went fucking saved by the bell on this shit.
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:32.640]  All right, you guys, the program crashed.
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:33.640]  We had to restart it.
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:36.080]  I just give you, given a shout out and had to restart.
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:37.080]  That's the truth.
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:38.080]  That is the truth.
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:40.280]  I just given a shout out to the judge that resided over that courtroom.
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:41.280]  I felt that it was fair.
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:42.280]  I liked the way he treated people.
[03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:45.640]  I don't know how much of that got recorded, but I went to jury duty.
[03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:46.640]  You guys, it wasn't that bad.
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:47.640]  The judge was cool.
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:48.640]  It was fair.
[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:52.880]  So, before we move on from that and keep going while the computer is working, that email
[03:01:52.880 --> 03:01:56.480]  said that they wish I'd do more grow lessons.
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:01:57.480]  That'll come, you guys.
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:01:58.480]  I'm working on it.
[03:01:58.480 --> 03:02:01.440]  I don't know if that got recorded in the part before, so we may have just double talked
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:02.440]  that part.
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:03.440]  Yep.
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:04.440]  More grow lessons are coming.
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:05.440]  Yes.
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:06.440]  So, let's get to the meat of the show.
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:07.440]  Email us and ask us what you want us to talk about or him to talk about.
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:08.440]  Yeah.
[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:09.440]  We may have said that before.
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:10.440]  I don't know.
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:11.440]  Or recruit the appropriate people.
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:13.600]  I don't know if we're double talking, because I don't know how much of that made it to the
[03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:14.600]  recording, but that's the truth.
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:15.600]  You guys are going to find out.
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:17.640]  If you want more grow lessons, all you got to do is let me know what you want to learn
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:18.640]  about.
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:19.640]  Send me an email.
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:20.640]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:21.640]  You can tweet me.
[03:02:21.640 --> 03:02:22.640]  It's at GFYHpodcast.
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:23.640]  You can find me on Facebook.
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:25.180]  You can send me a text message.
[03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:27.560]  You can- That's all one memory file.
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:28.560]  That was funny.
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:29.560]  Did you like how that went?
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:30.560]  Yeah.
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:31.560]  Yeah.
[03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:32.560]  That's a lot of- It was almost like a Tourette's spasm.
[03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:33.560]  Tweet, tweet.
[03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:34.560]  Tweet, tweet.
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:35.560]  Sorry, I didn't mean to make fun of Tourette's people.
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:36.560]  That was rude.
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:37.560]  So, I've got...
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:41.560]  You guys want more grow lessons and shit.
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:42.560]  I understand.
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:43.560]  You guys would like...
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:46.400]  I've got a listener that sent me the email, said that he would like more lessons on BHO
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:49.280]  and he would like a pesticide issue or episode.
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:53.000]  We will get our friend Sean over here as soon as I can get him back and we will do an organic
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:54.520]  pesticide management episode.
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:59.160]  And then I need to find ourselves some hash experts and we will do some hash episodes.
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:00.400]  I'm not a hash expert, you guys.
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:01.400]  That is not me.
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:04.120]  Spence is a busy motherfucker, so getting him to come over here is going to cost me
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:07.040]  like 50 bucks an hour to get him to come record all the time.
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:08.040]  But we'll get a hash expert.
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:09.600]  We'll get him to come on the show.
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:11.400]  Let's get down to the point of the show, you guys.
[03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:15.960]  We've been going for 15 minutes and all we've done is talk a bunch of nonsense.
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:17.560]  We've been covering this a little bit lately.
[03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:20.800]  I've got three news articles I'm going to read the headline to, and then we're going
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:23.960]  to skip all of that, and then we're going to go to the main article that I want to talk
[03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:24.960]  about.
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:27.520]  But this is kind of a little bit of a buildup.
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:30.440]  On the website called The Cannabis, which is where I find a lot of my news, big shout
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:34.840]  out to David Magoya and Ricardo Baca for supplying the world with up-to-date cannabis news from
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:35.840]  Colorado.
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:37.160]  I found an article.
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:39.960]  This one was written on November 13th, and it says,
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:43.360]  Pesticide edict ensures fate of recalled Denver pot products.
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:47.980]  The byline is, nearly 30,000 marijuana-infused products recalled over pesticide concerns
[03:03:47.980 --> 03:03:53.720]  will likely be destroyed after Hickenlooper says they're public safety risk.
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:57.260]  Here's another article just to the headline, you guys, is all I'm going to read.
[03:03:57.260 --> 03:03:58.760]  This one, once again, was in The Cannabis.
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:04.320]  It says, Denver-based Lab 710 recalls pot products over pesticides.
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:09.840]  The byline is, in the state's eighth pot recall in 10 months, Lab 710 concentrates calls back
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:15.760]  2,362 packages of marijuana concentrates.
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:18.080]  Here is the third one that I want to read the headline to.
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.440]  It says, Denver issues ... This one was written on November 18th, once again, by Ricardo Baca
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:24.040]  and David Magoya of The Cannabis.
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:28.600]  It says, Denver issues ninth pot product recall in 10 weeks.
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:33.760]  The byline is, edibles company Guy's Garden issues its second voluntary recall in as many
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:37.440]  weeks after banned pesticides are detected in products.
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:42.600]  You guys, this is an upsetting trend we've been seeing here in Colorado in the commercial
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:43.600]  growing industry.
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:44.600]  I do not ...
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:45.600]  It depends on your perspective.
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:46.600]  Okay.
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:55.720]  I really hate that we're finding pesticides in final product, but I'm so thrilled that
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:57.960]  we're finding pesticides in final product.
[03:04:57.960 --> 03:05:00.400]  It's this weird duality.
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:02.080]  This is regulation working.
[03:05:02.720 --> 03:05:08.800]  When you go to the store and you buy a product, you know there's not pesticides in it.
[03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:13.600]  Now that cannabis is legal, we're a year or so from having all of that testing in place
[03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:19.400]  so that you know there's no bug shit, there's no pesticide, there's no mold or mildew.
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:21.440]  You're just getting delicious concentrates.
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:25.280]  It sucks that they're finding it, but it's awesome that they're finding it because now
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:26.280]  we can stop it.
[03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:31.440]  We can start teaching the growers and the grow facilities how to stop using these products.
[03:05:32.200 --> 03:05:36.120]  I pretty much in the future, I predict that the Department of Agriculture is going to
[03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:39.240]  create a pesticide class for the cannabis industry.
[03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:40.240]  They're going to have to do it.
[03:05:40.240 --> 03:05:41.240]  Yep.
[03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:42.240]  It's going to have to happen.
[03:05:42.240 --> 03:05:44.280]  They're going to have to make their own regulations because that's who's doing this.
[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:46.040]  They're going to have to tell us what we can and can't do.
[03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:47.040]  They kind of are now, but they're going to have to do a class.
[03:05:47.040 --> 03:05:50.120]  We're creating all of that stuff from the ground up.
[03:05:50.120 --> 03:05:55.120]  It exists in every other industry, but we're not allowed to access any of the components
[03:05:55.120 --> 03:05:59.960]  that do this for cantaloupe or tobacco or beer.
[03:05:59.960 --> 03:06:03.120]  Because cannabis is federally illegal, so we're not allowed to federally test.
[03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:04.120]  So now we can't find-
[03:06:04.120 --> 03:06:09.480]  All of the labs that are doing the testing were created by the demand the medical industry
[03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:11.560]  created here.
[03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:15.400]  All of the labs that are up and running around the state came from the medical marijuana
[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:17.600]  days and they weren't state mandated.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:21.480]  The industry demanded them and created them on their own.
[03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:26.480]  And when the testing labs went to apply for DEA licensing like they should, they all got
[03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:27.480]  raided.
[03:06:27.480 --> 03:06:28.480]  Ouch.
[03:06:28.480 --> 03:06:33.080]  They all got raided by the DEA licensing and just ran a testing lab anyway, just without
[03:06:33.080 --> 03:06:34.960]  that federal certification.
[03:06:34.960 --> 03:06:39.080]  Meaning that they can't do like organics testing or certifying or anything like that because
[03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:40.080]  that's all federal.
[03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:41.080]  Right.
[03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:42.080]  Shout out to Steve Hill Halen Labs.
[03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:43.080]  Yep.
[03:06:43.080 --> 03:06:45.880]  Actually, I don't think organic testing is actually federal.
[03:06:45.880 --> 03:06:46.880]  I mean-
[03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:48.200]  The regulations for using that word are.
[03:06:48.200 --> 03:06:49.200]  Okay.
[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:50.200]  That makes sense.
[03:06:50.200 --> 03:06:53.240]  Recently, if you're a legal marijuana business and you had organics in your name, you had
[03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:54.240]  to change that shit.
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:55.400]  We talked about that on the show a little bit.
[03:06:55.400 --> 03:06:56.400]  Yep.
[03:06:56.400 --> 03:06:57.400]  Shout out to Three Rivers Organics.
[03:06:57.400 --> 03:06:58.400]  Because of that.
[03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:00.320]  What you guys going to do?
[03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:01.320]  All right.
[03:07:01.320 --> 03:07:03.280]  So let's talk about this article a little bit, you guys.
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:07.400]  It seems to be a trend in Colorado that a lot of the commercial growers are using pesticides
[03:07:07.400 --> 03:07:09.000]  that have been banned.
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:13.360]  And that sounds ridiculous, but oftentimes these products were sprayed on the plants
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:17.140]  70 days ago and these rules came into effect 20 days ago.
[03:07:17.140 --> 03:07:19.680]  So you can't retroactively unspray your plants.
[03:07:19.680 --> 03:07:20.680]  You can't go back and-
[03:07:20.680 --> 03:07:22.840]  That's basically what we're seeing.
[03:07:22.840 --> 03:07:27.420]  Plants that were harvested six months ago and turned into other or sold off and turned
[03:07:27.420 --> 03:07:30.300]  into other products like edibles and concentrates.
[03:07:30.300 --> 03:07:31.300]  You know, I didn't put into-
[03:07:31.300 --> 03:07:32.300]  Four months ago.
[03:07:32.300 --> 03:07:34.500]  I didn't account for the time from...
[03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:35.980]  So you've got to grow these plants.
[03:07:35.980 --> 03:07:36.980]  They've got to veg.
[03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:37.980]  They've got to flower.
[03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:40.300]  You're looking at 90 to 120 days there.
[03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:41.300]  They've got to be harvested.
[03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:43.140]  They've got to be trimmed and dried and cured.
[03:07:43.140 --> 03:07:44.620]  You're looking at another two weeks there.
[03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:47.260]  So you're what, 140 days-ish?
[03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:49.780]  Somewhere between 120 and 150 days by now.
[03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:50.780]  Yep.
[03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:51.780]  Right?
[03:07:51.780 --> 03:07:52.780]  That's engineer math, right?
[03:07:52.780 --> 03:07:57.660]  So the product has to be picked up by the infusion company, the MIPS, whoever's going
[03:07:57.660 --> 03:07:59.700]  to turn it into something, the processing facility?
[03:07:59.700 --> 03:08:02.060]  I mean, then you've got drying and curing too.
[03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:03.060]  So that's another-
[03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:04.060]  Right.
[03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:05.060]  That's what got us to about 150.
[03:08:05.060 --> 03:08:09.980]  But like, yeah, we're still rolling on almost 200 days, 250 days between-
[03:08:09.980 --> 03:08:10.980]  Before it's even processed.
[03:08:10.980 --> 03:08:12.980]  Yeah, before it's even processed.
[03:08:12.980 --> 03:08:13.980]  Okay.
[03:08:13.980 --> 03:08:19.540]  But I mean, it wasn't standard practice for the company buying the product to lab test
[03:08:19.540 --> 03:08:20.540]  it again.
[03:08:20.540 --> 03:08:21.540]  Right.
[03:08:21.540 --> 03:08:25.820]  And that's one of the things that these recalls are starting to create is the first company
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:27.320]  to really fail.
[03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:31.380]  That was the first big policy change they announced was we're going to test everything
[03:08:31.380 --> 03:08:34.260]  that comes in now because that's how this happened.
[03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:38.020]  They process really nasty stuff.
[03:08:38.020 --> 03:08:40.940]  And we probably dabbed some of it.
[03:08:40.940 --> 03:08:41.940]  It could have happened.
[03:08:41.940 --> 03:08:42.940]  And you guys-
[03:08:42.940 --> 03:08:44.940]  A lot of people did.
[03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:48.620]  None of these recalls have been issued because people got sick or anything like that.
[03:08:48.620 --> 03:08:49.620]  It's-
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:50.620]  Right.
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:53.740]  It's just voluntary when they're going through and doing lab testing.
[03:08:53.740 --> 03:08:57.180]  When one of their products fails, they just do a massive recall on anything with that
[03:08:57.180 --> 03:08:58.180]  serial number.
[03:08:58.180 --> 03:09:01.180]  Which is admirable because that's a lot of money that these guys are losing.
[03:09:01.180 --> 03:09:02.180]  That's tons of money.
[03:09:02.180 --> 03:09:03.180]  Tons of money.
[03:09:03.180 --> 03:09:05.300]  I just measured money in weight.
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:06.300]  Tons of money.
[03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:07.300]  Yes.
[03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:08.300]  Dollar amounts in weight.
[03:09:08.300 --> 03:09:12.300]  So these plants could have been sprayed 200 days ago and these rules just were put into
[03:09:12.300 --> 03:09:15.460]  effect whenever, 30 days ago, 45 days ago.
[03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:17.860]  And so it's not like people are fucking up on purpose.
[03:09:17.860 --> 03:09:18.860]  It's not like it's ignorance.
[03:09:19.660 --> 03:09:22.580]  It's just timing of laws in a lot of the places.
[03:09:22.580 --> 03:09:26.900]  Something that I want to mention is all that weed you used to smoke back in the day before
[03:09:26.900 --> 03:09:30.140]  we had dispensaries, it was being sprayed with some shit.
[03:09:30.140 --> 03:09:33.980]  There was something worse than what's happening in these dispensaries on your weed.
[03:09:33.980 --> 03:09:34.980]  You've smoked it before.
[03:09:34.980 --> 03:09:40.420]  It's quality control is one of the first things legal marijuana created as a side industry.
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:42.060]  And it's been a beautiful thing.
[03:09:42.060 --> 03:09:49.300]  I saw quality go, when medical came real popular around 2010, quality skyrocketed.
[03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:52.020]  There was a huge competition for quality buds.
[03:09:52.020 --> 03:09:58.060]  And then around 2013, 2014, the quality started going away and the quantity started popping
[03:09:58.060 --> 03:09:59.060]  up.
[03:09:59.060 --> 03:10:00.180]  Now everything looks the same.
[03:10:00.180 --> 03:10:01.980]  Everything looks real similar.
[03:10:01.980 --> 03:10:07.220]  I'm going to try to make that different at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[03:10:07.220 --> 03:10:09.420]  We got fire genetics and I know how to grow.
[03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:12.060]  So I'm going to try to bring that quality back to the shelf.
[03:10:12.060 --> 03:10:13.060]  Green and Healthy Wellness.
[03:10:13.060 --> 03:10:14.060]  I can't wait to see it.
[03:10:14.060 --> 03:10:15.060]  Yeah.
[03:10:15.060 --> 03:10:17.420]  I keep looking back at the recording software to make sure we're getting what we're saying
[03:10:17.420 --> 03:10:19.740]  because we can't afford to try to do this all over again.
[03:10:19.740 --> 03:10:20.740]  That was weird.
[03:10:20.740 --> 03:10:21.740]  Right.
[03:10:21.740 --> 03:10:22.740]  All right.
[03:10:22.740 --> 03:10:23.740]  So we're talking a lot about these tainted products.
[03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:26.460]  This brings me to an email or an email, a news article.
[03:10:26.460 --> 03:10:27.460]  I wish there was an email.
[03:10:27.460 --> 03:10:28.660]  That would have been great.
[03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:32.300]  This one, Mike sent this to me from the Denver Post.
[03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:34.140]  Right on Mike for finding us the good news.
[03:10:34.140 --> 03:10:38.940]  The headline is, Hickenlooper issues executive order to declare tainted pot a threat to the
[03:10:39.460 --> 03:10:40.460]  public.
[03:10:40.460 --> 03:10:44.500]  The byline is any marijuana grown with unapproved pesticides would be removed from commerce
[03:10:44.500 --> 03:10:45.500]  and destroyed.
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:49.980]  Once again, the article is from David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[03:10:49.980 --> 03:10:51.060]  And it goes a little bit like this.
[03:10:51.060 --> 03:10:52.740]  I need to take a drink because I am dried up.
[03:10:52.740 --> 03:10:53.740]  Then I'll read you the article.
[03:10:53.740 --> 03:10:55.540]  Mike, say something impressive.
[03:10:55.540 --> 03:10:56.540]  Okay.
[03:10:56.540 --> 03:11:04.020]  Basically, this story, just to save Jeff the effort of reading a long letter from the governor,
[03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:10.100]  any marijuana grown with an unapproved pesticide is now a threat to public safety, just sort
[03:11:10.100 --> 03:11:12.020]  of by default.
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:20.660]  So any grow that's got an unapproved pesticide use going on in their grow is currently scrambling
[03:11:20.660 --> 03:11:23.700]  to figure out new pest management protocols.
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:30.940]  Because the rule in this that's going to really throw shockwaves through the industry is right
[03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:33.300]  now, cannabis is federally illegal.
[03:11:33.300 --> 03:11:39.340]  And to sell a pesticide in the United States, you need a federal certification and approval.
[03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:44.460]  And your product has to be tested for all kinds of stuff because it's being sprayed
[03:11:44.460 --> 03:11:47.340]  on God knows what around God knows who.
[03:11:47.340 --> 03:11:52.500]  So every pesticide comes with a lot of really specific rules about how they can and can't
[03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:56.020]  be used and what they can and can't be used on.
[03:11:56.020 --> 03:12:00.140]  And cannabis right now isn't on any of those labels.
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:05.020]  What the governor just said was if cannabis isn't on the label specifically, you can't
[03:12:05.020 --> 03:12:08.940]  use it to grow marijuana legally in Colorado.
[03:12:08.940 --> 03:12:15.020]  And nobody's going to put marijuana on there or cannabis or ganja because it's illegal.
[03:12:15.020 --> 03:12:17.700]  There is a caveat.
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:21.460]  Some pesticides have, they're super safe.
[03:12:21.460 --> 03:12:25.740]  You can use them on anything and they have a standardized phrase for that that'll be
[03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:26.740]  on the label.
[03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:33.780]  And if the pesticide carries that specific use designation, then it can be used on cannabis.
[03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:39.700]  So it's not like we can't use anything in this industry, but I guarantee there are countless
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:44.900]  grows around Colorado that have been using stuff that's perfectly acceptable for tobacco
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:52.740]  or flowers or food and has been used on cannabis for a decade or more around the country, everywhere,
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:54.700]  just as common practice.
[03:12:54.700 --> 03:12:58.220]  They're scrambling right now to figure out what they're going to replace that product with.
[03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:01.100]  It's going to make a huge difference for a lot of growers.
[03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:04.060]  So there's a timeline here and I will read part of the article, you guys.
[03:13:04.060 --> 03:13:06.460]  Mike tried to sum it up for us, but I'll read a bunch of it.
[03:13:06.460 --> 03:13:08.100]  There's a timeline off to the right of the article.
[03:13:08.100 --> 03:13:09.420]  That's what I was thinking about.
[03:13:09.420 --> 03:13:10.420]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:13:10.420 --> 03:13:11.420]  Thank you.
[03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:13.220]  I needed a little bit of hydration, so that helped out.
[03:13:13.220 --> 03:13:19.300]  There's a timeline here and it says on September 7th, months after marijuana holds, post test,
[03:13:19.300 --> 03:13:20.860]  find pesticides in products.
[03:13:20.860 --> 03:13:23.100]  And that was on September 7th.
[03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:27.900]  September 8th, Denver recalls Mahatma pot extracts containing unapproved pesticides.
[03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:33.140]  And then on the 18th, Denver issues two more recalls and it keeps going.
[03:13:33.140 --> 03:13:34.140]  Let's see.
[03:13:34.140 --> 03:13:35.820]  Colorado proposes stricter rules.
[03:13:35.820 --> 03:13:38.620]  Pot products made with unapproved pesticides recalled.
[03:13:38.620 --> 03:13:40.980]  On October 18th, Colorado puts...
[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:41.980]  What?
[03:13:41.980 --> 03:13:43.900]  That's not a real word.
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:45.420]  It's just abbreviated stuff.
[03:13:45.420 --> 03:13:47.580]  On industry to use pesticides that are safe on pot.
[03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:51.860]  And then on the 21st, Nature's Cure of Denver recalls pot products containing pesticides
[03:13:51.860 --> 03:13:52.860]  and it just keeps going, you guys.
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:55.900]  So there are a bunch of incidents of these pesticides on cannabis.
[03:13:55.900 --> 03:13:56.900]  We're going to keep seeing it.
[03:13:56.900 --> 03:13:59.940]  And then I think it'll taper off in the middle of next year.
[03:13:59.940 --> 03:14:04.380]  It should by summer of next year, by spring of next year, all this shit should be settled.
[03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:06.740]  Everybody should be well-educated on what they can and can't use.
[03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:09.300]  All the tainted herbs should be gone.
[03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:13.420]  Some of the problem here is we don't have enough testing labs.
[03:14:13.420 --> 03:14:17.860]  So if you're looking to invest in a fun side business, call us.
[03:14:17.860 --> 03:14:20.580]  We'll show you how to set up a testing lab.
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:23.140]  We want you to be able to test for residual solvents and hash.
[03:14:23.140 --> 03:14:25.460]  We need you to be able to test for pesticides and flowers.
[03:14:25.460 --> 03:14:28.900]  We need you to be able to test for molds and pathogens in our flowers.
[03:14:28.900 --> 03:14:32.300]  We need E. coli testing in the buds.
[03:14:32.300 --> 03:14:36.140]  We need all the potency testing, reliable potency testing.
[03:14:36.140 --> 03:14:37.140]  We need it all.
[03:14:37.140 --> 03:14:38.140]  All right.
[03:14:38.140 --> 03:14:39.140]  Let's read part of the article.
[03:14:39.140 --> 03:14:41.580]  I know Mike tried to sum it up, but it goes like this.
[03:14:41.580 --> 03:14:45.260]  Governor John Hickenlooper on Thursday issued an executive order telling state agencies
[03:14:45.260 --> 03:14:49.180]  that any marijuana grown with unapproved pesticides is a threat to public safety and should be
[03:14:49.180 --> 03:14:51.620]  removed from commerce and destroyed.
[03:14:51.620 --> 03:14:56.020]  The order is Hickenlooper's first word on a months old controversy over pesticide used
[03:14:56.020 --> 03:15:02.140]  to grow cannabis and a more aggressive approach than half the dozen recalls by Denver health
[03:15:02.140 --> 03:15:05.620]  officials have put on thousands of contaminated products.
[03:15:05.620 --> 03:15:08.020]  Some of it later allowed back into commerce.
[03:15:08.020 --> 03:15:09.020]  Sorry, you guys.
[03:15:09.020 --> 03:15:10.020]  That was hard to read.
[03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:11.020]  That was a really long sentence.
[03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:13.540]  That whole paragraph is one sentence and I didn't have a good rhythm.
[03:15:13.540 --> 03:15:15.180]  Sorry I made it wonky for you.
[03:15:15.180 --> 03:15:16.860]  Damn, that was a lot of breath.
[03:15:16.860 --> 03:15:17.980]  It's technical issues.
[03:15:17.980 --> 03:15:18.980]  We lost our rhythm.
[03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:19.980]  So sorry guys.
[03:15:19.980 --> 03:15:23.740]  I don't know if it's the tech issues or the dabs after, but it definitely fucked with
[03:15:23.740 --> 03:15:24.740]  my rhythm.
[03:15:24.740 --> 03:15:26.540]  A little from column A, a little from column B.
[03:15:26.540 --> 03:15:27.540]  That's the truth.
[03:15:27.540 --> 03:15:31.940]  The article goes on to say the order effective immediately was a result of a collaboration
[03:15:31.940 --> 03:15:36.420]  with officials from several state agencies, the department of agriculture, revenue and
[03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:41.900]  public health and environment among them and provides much needed clarity on the use of
[03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:45.980]  pesticides and how agencies should treat them according to a joint announcement, a
[03:15:45.980 --> 03:15:46.980]  joint announcement, right?
[03:15:46.980 --> 03:15:47.980]  Uh huh.
[03:15:47.980 --> 03:15:48.980]  All right.
[03:15:48.980 --> 03:15:52.660]  It says when a pesticide is applied to a crop in a manner that is inconsistent with the
[03:15:52.660 --> 03:15:57.500]  pesticides label and the crop is contaminated by that pesticide, it constitutes a threat
[03:15:57.500 --> 03:15:58.700]  to public safety.
[03:15:58.700 --> 03:16:04.540]  The order says the order says agencies agencies should use all investigative and enforcement
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:09.060]  authority to end the threat, including but not limited to placing contaminated marijuana
[03:16:09.060 --> 03:16:14.900]  on administrative hold and destroying contaminated marijuana pursuant to existing law.
[03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:18.860]  Industry spokepersons, spokespersons, God, my words are hard.
[03:16:18.860 --> 03:16:21.540]  Industry spokespersons could not be immediately reached for comment.
[03:16:21.540 --> 03:16:25.360]  Late Thursday, the order comes from Denver post stories that showed how potentially harmful
[03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:30.260]  pesticides barred for use on cannabis were still being applied and fought at high concentrations
[03:16:30.260 --> 03:16:33.340]  in products sold to customers.
[03:16:33.340 --> 03:16:38.180]  The Denver post is taking full credit for this executive order.
[03:16:38.300 --> 03:16:39.700]  Yeah, that's what, yeah, that's what that sounded like.
[03:16:39.700 --> 03:16:40.700]  Thanks for pointing that out.
[03:16:40.700 --> 03:16:44.780]  Newspapers love it when they can say we reported something and then change happened at a state
[03:16:44.780 --> 03:16:45.780]  level because of it.
[03:16:45.780 --> 03:16:48.580]  And so this is a huge feather in their cap.
[03:16:48.580 --> 03:16:53.340]  They've just been buying up random product to dispensaries and taking it to testing labs.
[03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:56.100]  I was going to say the Westward started that part of it.
[03:16:56.100 --> 03:17:00.540]  They, uh, the Westward and the Denver post both hammered the edibles industry a couple
[03:17:00.540 --> 03:17:04.340]  of years ago over potency issues.
[03:17:04.340 --> 03:17:07.600]  And then they started doing contaminants tests or the post started doing contaminants
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:11.380]  testing and it's definitely sent shockwaves through the industry.
[03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:13.380]  It's definitely caused change at a state level.
[03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:17.500]  So they're running around like they scored cause they fucking scored.
[03:17:17.500 --> 03:17:18.500]  They kind of did.
[03:17:18.500 --> 03:17:21.420]  Um, and it's been a good smack for the legal industry.
[03:17:21.420 --> 03:17:26.620]  I think like there was a little bit of shenanigans.
[03:17:26.620 --> 03:17:32.380]  Like we brought a lot of the black market stuff with us and eventually we were going
[03:17:32.380 --> 03:17:36.860]  to step up enough to where we had to play by the same rules everybody else did.
[03:17:36.860 --> 03:17:40.820]  And we've passed that point in Colorado now significantly.
[03:17:40.820 --> 03:17:44.900]  And so a lot of the things that happen at every employer are now going to be happening
[03:17:44.900 --> 03:17:47.260]  throughout the marijuana industry.
[03:17:47.260 --> 03:17:52.900]  And some of that's lab testing, some of that's recalls and it's about time it happened.
[03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:53.900]  It is, it is.
[03:17:53.900 --> 03:17:55.500]  All right, I'll keep going with the article.
[03:17:55.500 --> 03:17:57.180]  It says, uh, where was I?
[03:17:57.180 --> 03:17:59.700]  Uh, I wanted to give a shout out to Claude the candy man.
[03:17:59.700 --> 03:18:00.700]  We're talking about edibles.
[03:18:00.700 --> 03:18:01.980]  Uh, shout out to Claude the candy man.
[03:18:02.580 --> 03:18:06.300]  If you're on an adventure of a lifetime, you're probably not going to hear this podcast, but
[03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:11.700]  uh, Claude is taking a personal vacation and I've seen his Facebook pictures.
[03:18:11.700 --> 03:18:13.420]  The dude has never had a bigger smile.
[03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:14.420]  I'm jealous.
[03:18:14.420 --> 03:18:15.660]  He's making a life change and Claude.
[03:18:15.660 --> 03:18:16.660]  I'm proud of you, bro.
[03:18:16.660 --> 03:18:18.500]  Big shout out, uh, support sweet stone candy.
[03:18:18.500 --> 03:18:19.500]  That's what made me think of Claude.
[03:18:19.500 --> 03:18:20.500]  Yeah.
[03:18:20.500 --> 03:18:21.660]  He needs a shout out on the show.
[03:18:21.660 --> 03:18:25.420]  So it goes on to say the post also identified how state laws that barred the use of certain
[03:18:25.420 --> 03:18:29.580]  pesticides were not enforced and that testing requirements for pesticide residues were set
[03:18:29.580 --> 03:18:30.580]  aside.
[03:18:31.180 --> 03:18:33.300]  And then it says a threat to safety.
[03:18:33.300 --> 03:18:37.500]  Uh, Thursday's bulletin specifically mandates state agencies to determine any off label
[03:18:37.500 --> 03:18:42.620]  use of a pesticides, a threat to public safety and ensure that the contaminated products
[03:18:42.620 --> 03:18:44.700]  are quarantined and destroyed.
[03:18:44.700 --> 03:18:47.140]  Oh, that's a bunch of hash and pot.
[03:18:47.140 --> 03:18:48.140]  You just got to watch.
[03:18:48.140 --> 03:18:49.260]  Get just destroyed.
[03:18:49.260 --> 03:18:52.900]  I'm wondering how high the animals, the landfill, you're going to end up.
[03:18:52.900 --> 03:18:56.660]  Are they just going to burn it like back in the day when the fire department used to just
[03:18:56.660 --> 03:18:58.140]  put all the bales of weed in the fire?
[03:18:58.140 --> 03:19:01.540]  They still do that all over the place and every now and then they fuck it up and get
[03:19:01.540 --> 03:19:03.300]  the whole town really high.
[03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:08.060]  Yeah, but I, I don't know, maybe I think it's just going to get blended with dirt is what
[03:19:08.060 --> 03:19:10.180]  it's probably going to happen with it.
[03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:11.740]  That's kind of what happens at a dispensary.
[03:19:11.740 --> 03:19:16.020]  Uh, if you run a soil grow and you got to throw leaves away, you do like lasagna, you
[03:19:16.020 --> 03:19:18.900]  do leaves, dirt, leaves, dirt, just mash it up.
[03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:19.900]  Yep.
[03:19:19.900 --> 03:19:20.900]  All right.
[03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:22.500]  The article goes on to say Thursday's bulletin specifically meant no way.
[03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:23.500]  I just read that part.
[03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:27.460]  Uh, that is, uh, that is a stiffer approach than the quantity quarantines and recalls.
[03:19:27.460 --> 03:19:31.700]  Denver health officials have put on marijuana products contaminated with unapproved pesticides.
[03:19:31.700 --> 03:19:34.100]  In most cases, the products were allowed back into commerce.
[03:19:34.100 --> 03:19:38.420]  Once test confirmed, pesticide residues were at levels lower than what's allowed on other
[03:19:38.420 --> 03:19:40.340]  consumable crops.
[03:19:40.340 --> 03:19:44.220]  Pick and Looper's order appears to leave no room for trace amounts and recalls for the
[03:19:44.220 --> 03:19:48.220]  destruction of the affected plants and any derivative products.
[03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:50.720]  Zero, no trace elements.
[03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:54.940]  So if they used any pesticide and they find it on there pretty much bye bye to your whole
[03:19:54.940 --> 03:19:55.940]  product line.
[03:19:56.420 --> 03:20:01.500]  If they use some of this stuff, I mean, in years ago they could be destroying breeding
[03:20:01.500 --> 03:20:07.980]  stock or I mean how many, this is most of the recalls are stemmed from a couple of bigger
[03:20:07.980 --> 03:20:14.580]  grows that wholesale off, um, dried flour to other companies to make edibles or hash
[03:20:14.580 --> 03:20:15.580]  with.
[03:20:15.580 --> 03:20:20.420]  And so that's, it's the people that bought it that are now issuing recalls is they go
[03:20:20.420 --> 03:20:25.460]  through and they're like, wait, fuck, we bought 80 pounds of that and we make chocolate bars.
[03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:29.660]  So we threw that 80 pounds in with a thousand other pounds we bought and we made butter
[03:20:29.660 --> 03:20:34.580]  out of that and then we made edibles and now we've got to recall all the edible batches
[03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:36.420]  with those serial numbers on it.
[03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:39.220]  It's huge ripples to the industry.
[03:20:39.220 --> 03:20:41.220]  We're going to see lab testing at every level.
[03:20:41.220 --> 03:20:45.860]  We're going to see the labs triple or quadruple the number across the state to handle all
[03:20:45.860 --> 03:20:48.980]  the testing that's going to have to take place.
[03:20:48.980 --> 03:20:55.700]  I wouldn't be surprised to see a little spike in price of a buck or two per whatever to
[03:20:55.700 --> 03:20:59.660]  help cover all this fucking cost because yeah, it's going to play into it.
[03:20:59.660 --> 03:21:05.700]  But at the same time, I'm happy to buy stuff in the legal industry cause I know that it's
[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:06.940]  clean stuff's coming out.
[03:21:06.940 --> 03:21:07.940]  Yeah.
[03:21:07.940 --> 03:21:10.740]  I don't have to worry about what's being sprayed on it or what's still in it.
[03:21:10.740 --> 03:21:13.460]  Man, you just made the greatest argument for legal prostitution.
[03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:14.460]  Yup.
[03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:15.460]  Yup.
[03:21:15.460 --> 03:21:16.460]  That applies.
[03:21:16.460 --> 03:21:19.740]  I didn't just study legalizing weed in college, dude.
[03:21:19.740 --> 03:21:21.940]  We studied legalizing other stuff too.
[03:21:21.940 --> 03:21:22.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:21:22.940 --> 03:21:26.700]  Well, if the hookers are tested and clean, then it's better than getting some dirty hookers.
[03:21:26.700 --> 03:21:27.700]  All right.
[03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:28.700]  We've gotten sidetracked.
[03:21:28.700 --> 03:21:30.540]  I'm going to continue with the article here.
[03:21:30.540 --> 03:21:34.020]  It goes on to say, a company could destroy any affected marijuana voluntarily or face
[03:21:34.020 --> 03:21:38.100]  administrative actions by the state to force the destruction according to a policy statement
[03:21:38.100 --> 03:21:42.100]  issued by the chiefs of the three state agencies involved.
[03:21:42.100 --> 03:21:46.000]  There is no pesticide specifically approved for use on marijuana because the chemicals
[03:21:46.540 --> 03:21:50.880]  are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency and cannabis is illegal under federal
[03:21:50.880 --> 03:21:51.880]  law.
[03:21:51.880 --> 03:21:55.600]  As a result, there have been no tests to show how pesticides used on marijuana could affect
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:59.320]  consumers or whether their use is safe.
[03:21:59.320 --> 03:22:03.760]  But state agricultural officials have allowed certain pesticides to be used on marijuana
[03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:07.320]  crops only if it would not violate the restriction on the product's label.
[03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:11.280]  It is a violation of federal law to use a pesticide contrary to its label.
[03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:13.320]  Hey guys, this applies to you and your home grow.
[03:22:13.320 --> 03:22:15.680]  This applies to you and your greenhouse grow.
[03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:19.480]  If the cop wants to be a dick, it can be an extra charge.
[03:22:19.480 --> 03:22:20.480]  Yep.
[03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:24.600]  All you got to do when you buy your spray products, your pesticides, peel off that little
[03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:26.480]  booklet that's on the back and read it.
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:28.400]  There will be rules on there.
[03:22:28.400 --> 03:22:33.640]  There will be, what you should really pay attention to is the interval of re-entry.
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:37.400]  If it says not to go in the sprayed area for four hours, you should probably stay out of
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:38.800]  there for four hours.
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:39.800]  Take that seriously.
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:42.880]  You're not going to notice that you're getting sick from a pesticide until you start twitching
[03:22:42.880 --> 03:22:43.880]  in five years.
[03:22:43.880 --> 03:22:44.880]  Right.
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:46.800]  I really want to read those labels.
[03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:47.800]  Yeah.
[03:22:47.800 --> 03:22:50.000]  So where the heck was I?
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:53.760]  Despite the prohibitions, the post revealed in its own testing that a number of marijuana
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:59.240]  infused products contained high levels of pesticides not allowed for use on cannabis.
[03:22:59.240 --> 03:23:02.680]  What followed were a number of recalls issued by the Denver Department of Environmental
[03:23:02.680 --> 03:23:07.800]  Health after investigations into businesses connected with the post's findings.
[03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:08.800]  We're at the last paragraph.
[03:23:08.800 --> 03:23:09.800]  You guys go ahead, Mike.
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:10.800]  You had something to say.
[03:23:10.800 --> 03:23:11.920]  They downplayed the other half of their findings.
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:14.240]  They found, they tested eight samples.
[03:23:14.600 --> 03:23:20.240]  Two of them came back pretty dirty, but the other six came back cleaner than the lab testing
[03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:22.600]  dude had seen anything in a while.
[03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:23.600]  Nice.
[03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:24.840]  So, but that's not news.
[03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:26.520]  Well, it should be.
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:29.720]  It should be, but I mean, there's no scare tactic involved in that.
[03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:30.720]  Right.
[03:23:30.720 --> 03:23:34.920]  Like it's, it's really unfortunate that there's dirty product out on store shelves, but at
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:40.480]  the same time it's all being recalled because we've got testing labs no one else has.
[03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:43.840]  It's kind of a beautiful thing in such a fucked up way though.
[03:23:44.440 --> 03:23:45.440]  All right.
[03:23:45.440 --> 03:23:46.440]  You guys, I will try.
[03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:47.440]  I'm going to make myself a note.
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:50.440]  A list of approved.
[03:23:50.440 --> 03:23:51.440]  All right.
[03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:54.720]  I want to find a list of approved pesticides, which I need anyway for the shop.
[03:23:54.720 --> 03:23:57.080]  We just, we use basically one or two products at the shop.
[03:23:57.080 --> 03:24:01.480]  We've got a pretty good pesticide regiment going on there, but I will get a list of approved
[03:24:01.480 --> 03:24:06.400]  pesticides and we'll talk about that on the show when we do the pest management episode
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:08.120]  that I need to work on.
[03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:10.240]  I've got a lot of episodes that are like halfway written, you guys.
[03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:11.880]  I just need to put them together.
[03:24:11.880 --> 03:24:14.480]  Things have been really chaotic in my world.
[03:24:14.480 --> 03:24:17.600]  I've been driving to Springs like three times a week to talk about getting a job and now
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:19.960]  I've got the job, so it's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:23.800]  Let's get onto the last paragraph of this news article so that we can get Mike home
[03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:25.320]  to his little baby.
[03:24:25.320 --> 03:24:29.040]  It says, although state officials had been battling around pesticide rules for more than
[03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:33.200]  a year, there was no enforcement until Denver health officials quarantined more than a hundred
[03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:34.360]  thousand plants.
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:36.880]  It said were improperly grown with pesticides.
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:39.440]  The state said could not be used.
[03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:43.360]  The quarantines came after Denver fire inspectors found potentially hazardous pesticides and
[03:24:43.360 --> 03:24:47.560]  marijuana growing facilities during routine inspections this year and reported it to health
[03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:48.560]  officials.
[03:24:48.560 --> 03:24:50.560]  You guys, I mentioned this on the show.
[03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:55.240]  They found a Eagle 20 in there and when Eagle 20, is it Eagle 20 or fluoromite?
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:24:56.240]  It's Eagle 20.
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:25:01.280]  When Eagle 20 catches on fire and burns, the off gas that comes from Eagle 20 is cyanide.
[03:25:01.280 --> 03:25:05.840]  So that's why the fire department doesn't want that in your grow because when it catches
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:06.840]  on fire-
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:08.840]  They really read the fucking label, people.
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:10.240]  Yeah.
[03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:13.240]  Like know what you've got in your grow, know what you've got in your house.
[03:25:13.240 --> 03:25:15.240]  This is all going into your lungs.
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:18.240]  You should read the label on any product you're using anyway, all the time.
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:20.920]  You should kind of be aware of what you're putting into yourself, into your plants, into
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:23.040]  your food, feeding your dog.
[03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:24.040]  Read the label.
[03:25:24.040 --> 03:25:25.080]  All right.
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:26.360]  Last paragraph, you guys.
[03:25:26.360 --> 03:25:28.760]  Last small sentence in the paragraph.
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:32.000]  The state has a made rulemaking that would strictly limit the pesticides that can be
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  used on marijuana only to those whose labels allow for unspecified crops that can be used
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:41.280]  in greenhouses and that are not prohibited from human consumption.
[03:25:41.280 --> 03:25:45.080]  Pesticides allowed in tobacco cultivation also would be approved.
[03:25:45.080 --> 03:25:46.560]  All right.
[03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:52.840]  So any pesticides found in any tested cannabis equals your cannabis is now being destroyed.
[03:25:52.840 --> 03:25:53.840]  Yep.
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:55.800]  That's a huge move.
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:25:56.800]  Mike said it a minute ago.
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:25:58.080]  It's going to make prices go up.
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:02.040]  I mean, it's going to send big ripples through the industry.
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:06.680]  Not everybody was growing with the stuff that's being banned or was banned a couple
[03:26:06.680 --> 03:26:08.000]  months back.
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:15.800]  So it's not like everyone has to change up, but every company that buys product does.
[03:26:15.800 --> 03:26:21.360]  It's only a matter of time before shops are lab testing everything that comes in just
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:26.680]  as a matter of policy, let alone extract companies, edible companies.
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:29.080]  Just think of a product like Chibu Chu or Dixie Lixier.
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:30.480]  I'm thinking of the new Snoop Dogg products.
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:32.600]  How much stuff they buy and process, right?
[03:26:32.600 --> 03:26:34.680]  Or Snoop's new line or Rihanna's new line.
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:35.680]  They're like, there's fucking every-
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:36.680]  Wait, Rihanna's new line?
[03:26:36.680 --> 03:26:37.680]  Yep.
[03:26:37.680 --> 03:26:38.680]  What did I miss?
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:39.680]  That might've just been a meme on Facebook.
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:40.680]  I don't know.
[03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:41.680]  I'm high and I scroll through a lot of news.
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:42.680]  Yeah.
[03:26:42.680 --> 03:26:45.720]  But Willie's got a brand coming out.
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:46.720]  Just came out a couple days ago.
[03:26:46.720 --> 03:26:52.240]  If you're mildly famous for marijuana, you've got a fucking brand of marijuana coming out.
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:54.080]  Well, since we're on the topic-
[03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:55.080]  Chong store.
[03:26:55.080 --> 03:26:58.680]  You know what I was going to say is I want to see, since Snoop, and I'm not dissing you
[03:26:58.680 --> 03:26:59.680]  Snoop.
[03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:00.880]  I fucking love you, bro.
[03:27:00.880 --> 03:27:01.880]  Snoop Dogg.
[03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:02.880]  I'm from California, bro.
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:04.080]  I grew up, my cousin lived in Long Beach.
[03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:06.720]  I spent a lot of time in the LBC.
[03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:08.880]  Snoop Dogg actually went to school with my cousin.
[03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:10.880]  I think it was like Metsanka.
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:11.880]  Anyway, Snoop Dogg.
[03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:13.360]  I'm not dissing Snoop Dogg.
[03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:14.360]  He might be.
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:16.480]  How do you know Snoop ain't smoking a blunt listening to the grow from your heart?
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:17.640]  I listen to the GGN.
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:18.920]  He should listen to the grow from your heart.
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:19.920]  I'm really surprised.
[03:27:19.920 --> 03:27:20.920]  It's nice, but-
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:26.360]  Yeah, but Snoop, bro, you signed up with the shittiest fucking dispensary in Colorado.
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:29.360]  They are known to be the shittiest, the most low quality.
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:30.360]  The slow blow, right?
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:31.360]  Yeah.
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:32.360]  Yeah.
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:36.680]  They're that fucking dispensary that got, or is accused of handing out fucking potent
[03:27:36.680 --> 03:27:38.320]  edibles at the goddamn state fair.
[03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:40.360]  Yeah, they just keep fucking up left and right.
[03:27:40.360 --> 03:27:43.360]  So, and they also had a lot of pesticide issues in the past.
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:47.240]  So, I'm curious to see if Snoop's products have residual pesticides from when they were
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:48.240]  made back in the day.
[03:27:48.240 --> 03:27:49.240]  Who knows?
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:50.240]  Yeah.
[03:27:50.240 --> 03:27:51.240]  Yeah.
[03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:52.240]  Who do knows?
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:53.240]  Money, money, money, money.
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:54.240]  Wow.
[03:27:54.240 --> 03:27:55.240]  Yeah, I said it.
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:56.240]  You did that.
[03:27:56.320 --> 03:27:58.720]  So, we're talking about like celebrities and things that are going to have strains coming
[03:27:58.720 --> 03:27:59.720]  out.
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:02.160]  Let's go ahead and toot some iRegenetics horns here.
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:09.360]  Over the past two nights, I have been harvesting the lovely Damsel's Dank.
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:10.720]  It actually got harvested a few nights ago.
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:14.120]  It was finally dry enough to finish, do the final trim.
[03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:19.120]  So, Damsel's Dank, you guys, is jarred up and the curing process has begun.
[03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:23.320]  There will be a tasting party the first weekend of December.
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:24.320]  It's a private party.
[03:28:24.400 --> 03:28:27.400]  I would invite you, but I can't have all you guys showing up.
[03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:28.400]  Seat's taken.
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:29.400]  Yeah.
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:31.680]  All the seats are full, you guys.
[03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:32.680]  But I will let you know how it goes.
[03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:36.560]  I'll try to get Damsel on the show shortly after that so that she can talk about her
[03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:38.400]  new strain that I made for her.
[03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:40.280]  I hope she likes it.
[03:28:40.280 --> 03:28:45.240]  I can't wait till this process is over so I can finally get some details because all
[03:28:45.240 --> 03:28:49.920]  I've seen is three jar samples flashing in front of my nose earlier tonight.
[03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:54.200]  Yeah, a bunch of Instagram pictures and some jar samples is pretty much what I've shown
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:55.280]  anybody.
[03:28:55.280 --> 03:28:56.280]  Right.
[03:28:56.280 --> 03:28:58.680]  And I want to dig through all of those jars and there's a whole bunch of them over there.
[03:28:58.680 --> 03:29:02.680]  There are 10 that made it to the final round for Damsel to choose from.
[03:29:02.680 --> 03:29:07.200]  So whichever one of those 10 she likes the best, we will work with.
[03:29:07.200 --> 03:29:09.120]  She's human and she may reject all 10 of them.
[03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:10.960]  That may not be what she wants.
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:12.440]  This might just be round one.
[03:29:12.440 --> 03:29:13.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:29:13.440 --> 03:29:16.480]  And if that's the case, then I just did a really cool pheno hunt and I found at least
[03:29:16.480 --> 03:29:18.240]  three keepers out of that shit.
[03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:20.640]  Like there's some stank and there's some dank over there.
[03:29:20.640 --> 03:29:23.200]  You never end up bussed after a good pheno hunt.
[03:29:23.200 --> 03:29:24.200]  That's the truth.
[03:29:24.200 --> 03:29:25.200]  A pheno hunt.
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:26.200]  You guys listen to the episode I did about pheno hunting.
[03:29:26.200 --> 03:29:29.200]  I don't remember which number it is, but make sure you check out the website.
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:30.200]  Look it up.
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:31.200]  There you go.
[03:29:31.200 --> 03:29:32.200]  It's super easy to do.
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:33.200]  Yep.
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:34.200]  Go to iTunes.
[03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:35.200]  Go to iReadGeneticsColorado.com.
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:37.080]  Look for the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[03:29:37.080 --> 03:29:38.320]  Scroll through every episode is there.
[03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:40.460]  You'll find it, you guys.
[03:29:40.460 --> 03:29:42.000]  So we've covered the Hickenlooper article.
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:46.280]  You got anything else you want to say while we're on the air, bro?
[03:29:46.280 --> 03:29:47.280]  Not especially.
[03:29:47.280 --> 03:29:48.280]  You just like...
[03:29:48.280 --> 03:29:49.280]  Shout out to everybody.
[03:29:49.280 --> 03:29:51.480]  There's a lot of changes with people in my life this week.
[03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:54.920]  You change jobs, but you're not alone there.
[03:29:54.920 --> 03:29:57.760]  I've talked to a whole bunch of people that are going through big change right now.
[03:29:57.760 --> 03:30:01.800]  So shout out for people trying to do something that's going to make them happy.
[03:30:01.800 --> 03:30:02.800]  Yeah, that's the truth.
[03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:04.320]  Don't be afraid of a little bit of success.
[03:30:04.320 --> 03:30:08.400]  That's what I said on episode number 106 that nobody got to listen to because Stitcher failed
[03:30:08.400 --> 03:30:09.400]  us.
[03:30:09.400 --> 03:30:10.400]  I apologize.
[03:30:10.400 --> 03:30:11.400]  Yeah.
[03:30:11.400 --> 03:30:13.080]  So let's start wrapping up the show.
[03:30:13.080 --> 03:30:16.480]  It's been 40 something minutes minus whatever I have to edit out because of a little tech
[03:30:16.480 --> 03:30:17.480]  issue in the middle.
[03:30:17.480 --> 03:30:19.640]  Email us specific Grow questions.
[03:30:19.640 --> 03:30:20.640]  Yes.
[03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:21.800]  I love that.
[03:30:21.800 --> 03:30:24.080]  If you want to learn stuff about anything, email it to me.

[03:30:28.640 --> 03:30:30.960]  Find me on Facebook.
[03:30:30.960 --> 03:30:32.280]  Check out the Instagram, you guys.
[03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:34.240]  I use IryGenetics on Instagram.
[03:30:34.240 --> 03:30:35.240]  We've got 19,000 followers.
[03:30:35.240 --> 03:30:39.000]  When I get to 20,000, I'm going to start doing some giveaways.
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:40.320]  So get on there.
[03:30:40.320 --> 03:30:41.320]  Follow me.
[03:30:41.320 --> 03:30:42.320]  Join that shit.
[03:30:42.320 --> 03:30:43.320]  Do it.
[03:30:43.320 --> 03:30:44.320]  Do it.
[03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:45.320]  I like it.
[03:30:45.320 --> 03:30:46.320]  I like it when you ramble, people.
[03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:47.320]  We'll get you here next week.
[03:30:47.320 --> 03:30:48.320]  Yeah.
[03:30:48.640 --> 03:30:52.640]  Since I've got Mike here, Mike, you have got to scroll through Twitter and find the hashtag.
[03:30:52.640 --> 03:30:53.640]  I've got it.
[03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:58.360]  There were like four people who hashtagged this appropriately within the timeline.
[03:30:58.360 --> 03:31:00.360]  So we'll get them taken care of.
[03:31:00.360 --> 03:31:03.840]  If you count how many people there are, we'll put envelopes on the table and then we'll
[03:31:03.840 --> 03:31:07.720]  email them or they need to send us their addresses so that we can mail them stickers.
[03:31:07.720 --> 03:31:08.720]  Yeah.
[03:31:08.720 --> 03:31:10.520]  If you're listening again tonight, you know who you are.
[03:31:10.520 --> 03:31:17.080]  Direct message me or at NemoPunk15 or Jeff here at GrowFromYourHeart.
[03:31:17.240 --> 03:31:19.240]  Send it to at RastaJeff420.
[03:31:19.240 --> 03:31:20.240]  Yep.
[03:31:20.240 --> 03:31:24.480]  Just direct message that in Twitter or over Facebook or whatever and we'll get you your
[03:31:24.480 --> 03:31:25.480]  sticker pack mailed out.
[03:31:25.480 --> 03:31:26.480]  Yeah.
[03:31:26.480 --> 03:31:27.480]  We'll get your stickers to you.
[03:31:27.480 --> 03:31:28.480]  We did not forget.
[03:31:28.480 --> 03:31:29.480]  You guys are awesome.
[03:31:29.480 --> 03:31:31.200]  I got such a big grin every time one of those came through.
[03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:33.400]  It was a good hour of just smiling.
[03:31:33.400 --> 03:31:34.960]  Hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
[03:31:34.960 --> 03:31:35.960]  Yep.
[03:31:35.960 --> 03:31:36.960]  We love you guys too.
[03:31:36.960 --> 03:31:39.920]  Let's put an end to that now so that people can't jump on.
[03:31:39.920 --> 03:31:40.920]  No mas.
[03:31:40.920 --> 03:31:41.920]  No mas.
[03:31:41.920 --> 03:31:42.920]  That is over, you guys.
[03:31:42.920 --> 03:31:44.000]  When's this dropping?
[03:31:44.000 --> 03:31:48.560]  This will come out Monday, which will be the 23rd-ish.
[03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:51.040]  Monday the something something.
[03:31:51.040 --> 03:31:52.040]  Yeah.
[03:31:52.040 --> 03:31:53.040]  Monday.
[03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:54.040]  Come on, calendar.
[03:31:54.040 --> 03:31:55.040]  You got to go faster.
[03:31:55.040 --> 03:31:56.040]  23rd.
[03:31:56.040 --> 03:31:57.040]  I was correct.
[03:31:57.040 --> 03:32:00.560]  So Monday the 23rd, the hashtag, I like it when you ramble sticker pack.
[03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:01.560]  Sweepstakes.
[03:32:01.560 --> 03:32:02.560]  Sweepstakes.
[03:32:02.560 --> 03:32:03.560]  That is expired, you guys.
[03:32:03.560 --> 03:32:05.600]  That is no longer an offer.
[03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:09.040]  But if you really want some stickers, send me a tweet.
[03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:10.200]  Send the tweet to...
[03:32:10.200 --> 03:32:13.980]  I'm giving you so many different Twitter addresses to talk about now.
[03:32:13.980 --> 03:32:16.420]  Send the tweet to at GFYH podcast.
[03:32:16.420 --> 03:32:17.420]  Follow the podcast.
[03:32:17.420 --> 03:32:20.220]  We'll figure out how to get you some stickers one way or another.
[03:32:20.220 --> 03:32:23.380]  I may make you do something for them, but it won't be anything real crazy.
[03:32:23.380 --> 03:32:25.420]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for them.
[03:32:25.420 --> 03:32:26.420]  Something like that.
[03:32:26.420 --> 03:32:27.420]  Yeah.
[03:32:27.420 --> 03:32:30.020]  I'll probably make you follow me on Instagram and all seven of my Twitter accounts or something
[03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:31.020]  like that.
[03:32:31.020 --> 03:32:32.020]  I don't really have seven Twitters.
[03:32:32.020 --> 03:32:33.020]  That's an exaggeration.
[03:32:33.020 --> 03:32:34.020]  Social media challenge.
[03:32:34.020 --> 03:32:35.020]  Sometimes it feels like I do.
[03:32:35.020 --> 03:32:36.020]  All right.
[03:32:36.020 --> 03:32:37.020]  We're just rambling.
[03:32:37.020 --> 03:32:38.020]  Hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
[03:32:38.020 --> 03:32:39.020]  Speaking of being...
[03:32:39.020 --> 03:32:41.300]  I don't think that one's going to stick around.
[03:32:41.300 --> 03:32:42.300]  November 19th.
[03:32:42.300 --> 03:32:43.300]  Tomorrow is my mom's birthday.
[03:32:43.300 --> 03:32:44.300]  My mom does not listen to the podcast.
[03:32:44.300 --> 03:32:45.300]  My mom doesn't grow weed, but happy birthday, mom.
[03:32:45.300 --> 03:32:46.300]  You got to send her love either way.
[03:32:46.300 --> 03:32:47.300]  I guess that's a good way to wrap up the show, right?
[03:32:47.300 --> 03:32:48.300]  Yeah.
[03:32:48.300 --> 03:32:49.300]  You guys, make sure you follow us on all the social media.
[03:32:49.300 --> 03:32:50.300]  I'm sure you've caught all the names and places by now.
[03:32:50.300 --> 03:32:51.300]  Make sure you follow Mike.
[03:32:51.300 --> 03:32:52.300]  It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[03:32:52.300 --> 03:32:53.300]  Search him out.
[03:32:53.300 --> 03:32:54.300]  Follow him.
[03:32:54.300 --> 03:32:55.300]  Do you want to advertise your Facebook group while we're here?
[03:32:55.300 --> 03:32:56.300]  Yeah, I might as well.
[03:32:56.300 --> 03:32:57.300]  I haven't mentioned it until now, but fuck it.
[03:32:57.300 --> 03:32:58.300]  Follow me on Facebook if you like.
[03:32:58.300 --> 03:32:59.300]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[03:32:59.300 --> 03:33:00.300]  Just punch that in.
[03:33:00.300 --> 03:33:01.300]  I'm going to be doing a podcast.
[03:33:01.300 --> 03:33:02.300]  I'm going to be doing a podcast.
[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:18.820]  I have been getting a lot of feedback on that lately.
[03:33:18.820 --> 03:33:23.960]  Shit has been blowing up lately, because, anti-pop people have taken notice and are
[03:33:23.960 --> 03:33:26.860]  starting to get really pissed when I link their stuff and debunk it.
[03:33:26.860 --> 03:33:35.280]  It's led to some really hilarious little prohibitionist attempt to trolling, I suppose, is a good
[03:33:35.280 --> 03:33:36.860]  way to describe it.
[03:33:36.860 --> 03:33:42.180]  It's funny, because it's sort of like if a small child decided to lecture calculus at
[03:33:42.180 --> 03:33:45.260]  Like, it doesn't matter how passionate they are.
[03:33:45.260 --> 03:33:47.900]  Like, they're never going to get it right.
[03:33:47.900 --> 03:33:51.380]  You're not going to learn anything useful.
[03:33:51.380 --> 03:33:55.980]  It's just this weird thing that, I mean, to be against POD at this point in history is
[03:33:55.980 --> 03:33:59.300]  to have failed to do your homework.
[03:33:59.300 --> 03:34:01.500]  And that's just where the argument starts.
[03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:02.500]  Yeah.
[03:34:02.500 --> 03:34:03.500]  Poor Randy.
[03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:04.500]  Oh, poor Randy.
[03:34:04.500 --> 03:34:05.500]  Poor Randy.
[03:34:05.500 --> 03:34:06.500]  Randy, I slayed you.
[03:34:06.500 --> 03:34:09.380]  So much, so much passion, so little information.
[03:34:09.380 --> 03:34:10.380]  You're a poor little troll, Randy.
[03:34:10.580 --> 03:34:13.540]  And I done slayed you so many times and you just keep coming back for more.
[03:34:13.540 --> 03:34:15.300]  I need someone who likes to make memes.
[03:34:15.300 --> 03:34:17.940]  I don't have time to do this shit all the time.
[03:34:17.940 --> 03:34:19.860]  I need somebody to help me reply meme.
[03:34:19.860 --> 03:34:23.300]  We have got trolls on this podcast that listen religiously.
[03:34:23.300 --> 03:34:27.580]  So if you need a meme, you call them to action and we will get you some memes.
[03:34:27.580 --> 03:34:28.580]  Right.
[03:34:28.580 --> 03:34:29.580]  Yeah.
[03:34:29.580 --> 03:34:33.300]  The anti-POD community learned a meme like a week ago.
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:36.380]  And it's stuff that makes you want to put your head through a wall.
[03:34:36.380 --> 03:34:37.380]  All right.
[03:34:37.380 --> 03:34:42.140]  You guys are going to have to follow Mike so that you can help him with the meme more.
[03:34:42.140 --> 03:34:45.780]  I just don't have the energy all the time to fucking debunk nonsense because there's
[03:34:45.780 --> 03:34:47.340]  a lot of nonsense.
[03:34:47.340 --> 03:34:50.540]  This is way off topic, you guys, but I hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[03:34:50.540 --> 03:34:52.180]  And I hope you guys are listening still.
[03:34:52.180 --> 03:34:53.180]  Shout out if you are.
[03:34:53.180 --> 03:34:54.180]  Word of Ramlin.
[03:34:54.180 --> 03:34:59.380]  Facebook has murdered me over the past week with all of the change your profile picture
[03:34:59.380 --> 03:35:03.620]  to a French flag and all of this and everybody talking about who's a terrorist and who is
[03:35:03.620 --> 03:35:04.620]  not.
[03:35:04.620 --> 03:35:06.180]  That has burnt me the shit out, dude.
[03:35:06.980 --> 03:35:09.060]  I can't even look at Facebook the past week.
[03:35:09.060 --> 03:35:14.420]  I find myself shunning news and social media after events like this just because of all
[03:35:14.420 --> 03:35:15.420]  that.
[03:35:15.420 --> 03:35:17.420]  Like the event itself is bad enough.
[03:35:17.420 --> 03:35:21.620]  All the hate and the fear and the idiocy and the ignorance that led up to it's bad enough.
[03:35:21.620 --> 03:35:24.420]  But then the shit that comes after is just so much worse.
[03:35:24.420 --> 03:35:25.420]  Right.
[03:35:25.420 --> 03:35:26.420]  Yeah.
[03:35:26.420 --> 03:35:27.420]  Yeah.
[03:35:27.420 --> 03:35:28.420]  Facebook just makes me want to smash my head into the wall lately.
[03:35:28.420 --> 03:35:29.420]  So I've been avoiding that.
[03:35:29.420 --> 03:35:32.380]  Sorry if I haven't been returning your Facebook messages and all that stuff for the past week,
[03:35:32.380 --> 03:35:33.380]  you guys.
[03:35:33.380 --> 03:35:34.380]  I'm going to go ahead and get rid of all of this stuff.
[03:35:34.380 --> 03:35:35.380]  Stops on Facebook.
[03:35:35.380 --> 03:35:38.820]  Once we go back to talking about football games and stupid shit, I'll be back.
[03:35:38.820 --> 03:35:41.340]  Yeah, it's a little too intense right now.
[03:35:41.340 --> 03:35:44.500]  I have to go unfriend people because of some of the shit that I see.
[03:35:44.500 --> 03:35:46.220]  I'm not going to tolerate some of it.
[03:35:46.220 --> 03:35:49.180]  Like I'm not going to get all political and get my opinion going too much on here.
[03:35:49.180 --> 03:35:50.180]  This is weed podcast.
[03:35:50.180 --> 03:35:55.260]  But God damn, some people get really, really ridiculous really, really quickly when people
[03:35:55.260 --> 03:35:56.260]  are afraid.
[03:35:56.260 --> 03:35:58.420]  They do really, really crazy, insane things.
[03:35:58.420 --> 03:36:02.780]  And that's what's going on right now is there's a lot of fear out there and people are just
[03:36:02.780 --> 03:36:04.500]  diving into it because it's easy.
[03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:05.500]  There is a lot of fear.
[03:36:05.500 --> 03:36:06.780]  You guys don't buy into the fear.
[03:36:06.780 --> 03:36:07.780]  Find the truth.
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:10.140]  I know that's hard to do in the world right now.
[03:36:10.140 --> 03:36:13.380]  There are a lot of clouds plus the ones we're blowing, but you got to try to find the truth.
[03:36:13.380 --> 03:36:14.380]  Search for the truth.
[03:36:14.380 --> 03:36:16.020]  The truth will set you free.
[03:36:16.020 --> 03:36:17.020]  Yeah.
[03:36:17.020 --> 03:36:18.020]  All right.
[03:36:18.020 --> 03:36:19.020]  And calm the fuck down.
[03:36:19.020 --> 03:36:21.020]  Take some tabs and calm the fuck down.
[03:36:21.020 --> 03:36:23.820]  Like God, that's how I feel that way about half of the people that I see.
[03:36:23.820 --> 03:36:25.980]  I'm like, you need a dab and a fucking chill pill.
[03:36:25.980 --> 03:36:30.460]  Then the main thought going through my head the last two weeks is just like, dude, calm
[03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:31.460]  the fuck down.
[03:36:31.460 --> 03:36:32.460]  Yeah.
[03:36:33.140 --> 03:36:34.140]  I'm like, I need two dabs and a nappy nap.
[03:36:34.140 --> 03:36:35.140]  Like that's what your life needs.
[03:36:35.140 --> 03:36:38.140]  Hey Bernie, if you're listening to the podcast, bro, we're still friends.
[03:36:38.140 --> 03:36:41.780]  Bernie, you need a dab and a nap, but we're still friends, bro.
[03:36:41.780 --> 03:36:42.780]  Even though we had a heated conversation.
[03:36:42.780 --> 03:36:43.780]  That's so funny.
[03:36:43.780 --> 03:36:45.780]  I gave him a dab and a nap the other day and it worked out pretty well.
[03:36:45.780 --> 03:36:46.780]  Did you tuck him in?
[03:36:46.780 --> 03:36:51.340]  No, I just gave him a couple of dabs and sent him home and he replied or sent me a message
[03:36:51.340 --> 03:36:54.140]  like 12 hours later that was like, got super high and went home and went to sleep.
[03:36:54.140 --> 03:36:56.940]  Did you drive him around in your kid's new car seat?
[03:36:56.940 --> 03:36:57.940]  Nope.
[03:36:57.940 --> 03:36:58.940]  Sorry, Bernie.
[03:36:58.940 --> 03:36:59.940]  I had to, bro.
[03:37:00.420 --> 03:37:03.420]  If you guys didn't catch on, Bernie's about three foot two, I think.
[03:37:03.420 --> 03:37:04.420]  That's what his boots are.
[03:37:04.420 --> 03:37:05.420]  Nah, he's like five foot nothing.
[03:37:05.420 --> 03:37:06.420]  He's a great guy.
[03:37:06.420 --> 03:37:07.420]  That's why I don't feel bad picking on him because he's actually a good dude.
[03:37:07.420 --> 03:37:08.420]  And that's why I'm giving him a shout out and saying, even though we had a heated conversation
[03:37:08.420 --> 03:37:09.420]  on Facebook and we totally disagree on some shit, I agree that we disagree and you're
[03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:10.420]  still my bro.
[03:37:10.420 --> 03:37:11.420]  Right?
[03:37:11.420 --> 03:37:12.420]  Yeah.
[03:37:12.420 --> 03:37:13.420]  We just can't.
[03:37:13.420 --> 03:37:14.420]  He's a politics.
[03:37:14.420 --> 03:37:15.420]  He's a Marine.
[03:37:15.420 --> 03:37:16.420]  And so he's done shit.
[03:37:16.420 --> 03:37:17.420]  And a combat vet.
[03:37:17.420 --> 03:37:18.420]  Yeah.
[03:37:18.420 --> 03:37:19.420]  Thank you.
[03:37:19.420 --> 03:37:20.420]  Thank you.
[03:37:20.420 --> 03:37:21.420]  And all the combat vets.
[03:37:21.420 --> 03:37:22.420]  Because if you're not a combat vet, you're not a Marine.
[03:37:22.420 --> 03:37:23.420]  You're not a Marine.
[03:37:23.420 --> 03:37:24.420]  You're not a Marine.
[03:37:24.420 --> 03:37:25.420]  I've thought about that a lot.
[03:37:25.420 --> 03:37:26.420]  Like even when I was a teenager and I had friends that were like, I think I'm going
[03:37:26.420 --> 03:37:27.420]  to go sign up for the Air Force.
[03:37:27.420 --> 03:37:28.420]  I was like, I would die twice.
[03:37:28.420 --> 03:37:29.420]  Like, that's so not me.
[03:37:29.420 --> 03:37:30.420]  Bro, you've played black ops with me.
[03:37:30.420 --> 03:37:31.420]  You want to be in the military with me?
[03:37:31.420 --> 03:37:32.420]  No, I'm not.
[03:37:32.420 --> 03:37:33.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:33.420 --> 03:37:34.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:34.420 --> 03:37:35.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:35.420 --> 03:37:36.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:36.420 --> 03:37:37.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:37.420 --> 03:37:38.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:38.420 --> 03:37:39.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:39.420 --> 03:37:40.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:40.420 --> 03:37:41.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:41.420 --> 03:37:42.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:42.420 --> 03:37:43.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:43.420 --> 03:37:44.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:44.420 --> 03:37:45.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:45.420 --> 03:37:46.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:46.420 --> 03:37:47.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:47.420 --> 03:37:48.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:48.420 --> 03:37:49.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:49.420 --> 03:37:50.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:50.420 --> 03:37:51.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:51.420 --> 03:37:52.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:52.420 --> 03:37:53.420]  I'm not.
[03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:55.480]  Nope, if I throw it.
[03:37:55.480 --> 03:37:58.080]  If I get flash-banged, 90% of the time it's because I threw the flash-bang.
[03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:00.860]  Tight pants, lots of running.
[03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:01.860]  That's so not me.
[03:38:01.860 --> 03:38:02.860]  The desert?
[03:38:02.860 --> 03:38:03.860]  The desert.
[03:38:03.860 --> 03:38:04.860]  Nope, not me.
[03:38:04.860 --> 03:38:05.980]  I don't look good with camo.
[03:38:05.980 --> 03:38:06.980]  Your weapons are loud.
[03:38:06.980 --> 03:38:08.520]  I'd miss everybody on purpose, bro.
[03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:12.420]  You'd be like, they're the terrorists and I'd be like, just kind of fake aiming at them.
[03:38:12.420 --> 03:38:13.420]  Tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a tick-a-dick-a-did.
[03:38:13.420 --> 03:38:14.420]  Shooting next to them to scare them away.
[03:38:14.420 --> 03:38:15.680]  Did you hear the sirens just now?
[03:38:15.680 --> 03:38:16.680]  I did.
[03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:17.680]  That was crazy.
[03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:18.680]  It came through my headphones.
[03:38:18.680 --> 03:38:20.320]  All right, you guys, we are totally rambly.
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:21.360]  We're totally off topic.
[03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:22.640]  I said happy birthday to my mom.
[03:38:22.640 --> 03:38:24.040]  That was the last note that I had.
[03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:25.080]  We're gonna start wrapping up the show.
[03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:26.120]  I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:27.440]  Mike, dude, thanks for coming.
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:28.720]  Hey, Jen, if you listen to the show,
[03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:29.880]  thanks for letting me borrow your husband
[03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:30.720]  for an hour or two.
[03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:32.320]  Sorry I sent him home high as fuck.
[03:38:32.320 --> 03:38:35.600]  But I appreciate you letting him come over
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:37.200]  and spend some time with me and record a podcast.
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:39.200]  The listeners really appreciate him on here.
[03:38:39.200 --> 03:38:40.360]  Hey, Davey, if you're listening, bro,
[03:38:40.360 --> 03:38:42.360]  I hope you're feeling better.
[03:38:42.360 --> 03:38:43.200]  Get well, little man.
[03:38:43.200 --> 03:38:44.040]  Have a good night, buddy.
[03:38:44.040 --> 03:38:44.860]  Yeah.
[03:38:44.860 --> 03:38:46.320]  All right, so we're wrapping up the show, you guys.
[03:38:46.320 --> 03:38:47.360]  If you wanna visit the website
[03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:48.760]  and hit the PayPal donation button,
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:49.600]  that would be super awesome,
[03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:50.640]  but I'm not gonna beg you for it.
[03:38:50.640 --> 03:38:52.680]  What I'd really rather you do is follow me on Instagram.
[03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:53.520]  It's iRegenetics.
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:55.960]  A vital piece of equipment is down right now, y'all.
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:38:58.160]  We need you to step up and help out the show.
[03:38:58.160 --> 03:39:01.880]  Yes, the coil on the Gmail has taken a shit.
[03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:03.200]  So if you wanna send a donation,
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:05.520]  go to iRegeneticsColorado.com,
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:07.320]  click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:09.360]  On the top right, there's a PayPal logo.
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:10.840]  Click on that PayPal logo.
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:11.840]  It'll take you to PayPal.
[03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:13.680]  You can throw a donation my direction.
[03:39:13.680 --> 03:39:14.720]  I would totally appreciate it.
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:16.040]  I'd give you a shout on the show.
[03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:17.240]  It's not necessary.
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:18.960]  This show is always going to be free.
[03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:19.880]  Free, free, freedom.
[03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:21.640]  I wanna share my knowledge and my love for cannabis
[03:39:21.640 --> 03:39:22.560]  with you for free.
[03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:23.760]  But if you wanna make a donation,
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:25.240]  I'd love the fuck out of you.
[03:39:25.240 --> 03:39:26.760]  We would buy a new coil for the Gmail.
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:27.880]  Things would work out.
[03:39:27.880 --> 03:39:29.200]  And you'll never have to hear the torch
[03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:30.160]  coming through the microphone.
[03:39:30.160 --> 03:39:33.200]  You notice we didn't dab because the torch is just,
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:34.600]  so this is what it sounds like when you dab
[03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:35.440]  with the torch.
[03:39:35.440 --> 03:39:36.440]  When you're taking off.
[03:39:36.440 --> 03:39:37.520]  That's what you guys are missing.
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:39.440]  Sounds like a plane taking off, exactly.
[03:39:39.440 --> 03:39:41.160]  All right, we're on ramble the fuck mode.
[03:39:41.160 --> 03:39:42.200]  So we're gonna turn off the mics.
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:43.280]  We're gonna take some more dabs.
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:45.280]  We're gonna hang out and be bros for a few minutes.
[03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:47.120]  I wanna thank everybody for listening to this super long.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:49.480]  I wanna give a shout out to Danielle.
[03:39:49.480 --> 03:39:50.360]  Good luck in Denver.
[03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:51.760]  I hope everything goes your way.
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:52.600]  Good luck, girl.
[03:39:52.600 --> 03:39:53.440]  Yeah, good luck.
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:54.280]  I wanna give a shout out to,
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:39:55.600]  hey, shout out to Spence and Maddie.
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:56.600]  They hit me up this afternoon.
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:39:57.680]  They're like, what you doing, fool?
[03:39:57.680 --> 03:39:58.520]  And I was like, I'm gardening.
[03:39:58.520 --> 03:39:59.520]  And they're like, you wanna go to lunch?
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:00.360]  And I was like, you know what?
[03:40:00.360 --> 03:40:01.200]  I wanna go to lunch.
[03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:02.040]  So we went and had pho.
[03:40:03.080 --> 03:40:04.080]  It was fucking delicious.
[03:40:04.080 --> 03:40:04.920]  Quality local food.
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:06.400]  So shout out to, yeah, shout out to Spence and Maddie
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:07.240]  and shout out to Pho.
[03:40:07.240 --> 03:40:08.280]  It was really good.
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:11.160]  On that note, big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:12.320]  Until next time, you guys,
[03:40:12.320 --> 03:40:14.680]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
