[00:00.000 --> 00:06.120]  What's up, podcast world? It is time for episode 465 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Yes,
[00:06.120 --> 00:11.600]  in the last episode I said 465, it was 464. Stop sending me emails. This episode of the
[00:11.600 --> 00:15.720]  show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now. If you need new regular, feminized,

[00:28.560 --> 00:31.160]  our favorite guest, White Mike. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:31.160 --> 00:33.760]  Thanks, man. What's up, everybody? How are you doing today, Mike?
[00:33.760 --> 00:37.120]  Doing pretty good, man. It is a nice, sunshiny day. It's fucking warm
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.120]  out there. It is beautiful. Gotta love it right now.
[00:40.120 --> 00:43.040]  We just took some dabs, and then Mike had to go have a cigarette. We were watching the
[00:43.040 --> 00:46.320]  clouds. I took so many dabs, I saw a dragon in the clouds.
[00:46.320 --> 00:49.720]  Yeah, we were starting to see stuff in the clouds and thought, you know what? We're in
[00:49.720 --> 00:53.480]  the right headspace to hit record. That is a good day. We like to start the show
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.160]  off by talking about what we're smoking. We took some dabs of Copper Chem full spectrum
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.440]  extract from our friends at Green Dot Labs. It is tremendously tasty. It is a blend. This
[01:02.440 --> 01:09.080]  is actually a cross of Chem 4 and Star Dog. The aroma and flavors are described as described.
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.000]  I'm having a hard time with words lately. The flavors are described as guava juice and
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.320]  watermelon. I would give the watermelon absolutely a thumbs up. I don't know if I know what guava
[01:19.320 --> 01:25.240]  juice smells like. There's also a hint of gassy stuff going on in there.
[01:25.400 --> 01:27.000]  I got the gassy in the watermelon.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.600]  Yeah, gassy watermelon. It's a great cross. I like the flavor. The label says 67.9% THC.
[01:33.600 --> 01:37.920]  I do approve of the buzz. Like I said, I saw a fucking dragon in the clouds. It's a good
[01:37.920 --> 01:38.920]  concentrate, dude.
[01:38.920 --> 01:40.920]  It's tasty. Thank you, Green Dot Boys.
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.400]  Yes. Big shout out to our friends at Ladies and Gentlemen at Green Dot Labs. I do have
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.760]  some fun stuff to talk about, but we have to stick to the script. Let's not get carried
[01:49.760 --> 01:54.840]  away. Let's do a shout out to some of our friends from Patreon. Let's start off with
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.080]  a big giant shout out and a thank you to our friends at Hogan's Farms. How about a big
[01:59.080 --> 02:04.080]  giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to Know Me By My Guacamole.
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.040]  You will know him by his guacamole. Don't worry. Maybe her by her guacamole. We don't
[02:08.040 --> 02:12.040]  want to single anybody out. Big shout out to Ryan S. How about a big giant Grow From
[02:12.040 --> 02:17.480]  Your Heart podcast shout out to Squirrel Tactics. Of course, a big giant Grow From Your Heart
[02:17.480 --> 02:22.320]  podcast shout out. Thank you. And a fist bump to my friend, Bafsta. I want to send
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.120]  a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you to each and everybody. Each and everybody.
[02:27.120 --> 02:30.760]  What's up with my words, bro? I'm going to blame it on the Green Dot. Anyway, big thank
[02:30.760 --> 02:34.840]  you to everybody who supports the show on Patreon. If you would like to learn how to

[02:42.800 --> 02:47.800]  all of the information that you need will be right there on the screen. Man, I'm glad
[02:47.800 --> 02:52.400]  we're through the business. I am stumbling with my face today. Got through the required.
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.720]  Today, what is the date? I need to look at my phone and see the actual real date. Today
[02:56.720 --> 03:04.480]  is Friday, September 20th. When I woke up today, I was oddly excited to check my news
[03:04.480 --> 03:11.520]  feed and to see what was going on in the world because today is the start of the raid on
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.640]  Area 51. There's a lot we could talk about here. I don't want to go too long on this
[03:16.640 --> 03:23.440]  because this is just a beautiful story. It's fun. It's entertaining. So there is a raid
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.800]  on Area 51. Let's talk briefly about Area 51. A long time ago, I don't know the year,
[03:27.800 --> 03:33.000]  I didn't do any research. Maybe, possibly some aliens crashed in Roswell, New Mexico.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.120]  Maybe, I don't know. Allegedly. I'm not even going to fucking go down that path. We'll
[03:37.120 --> 03:43.520]  ask Eddie Bravo about that shit. So maybe some aliens crashed. There was a museum and
[03:43.520 --> 03:49.840]  also a base made based on this discovery or these findings of these alien parts. Area
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.560]  51 is where the spacecraft and all the shit was taken. The crime scene was moved to Area
[03:55.560 --> 04:03.360]  51. Capital, allegedly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if that isn't the story, then none of
[04:03.360 --> 04:07.120]  the other part adds up. So a lot of people think there are aliens there. They've moved
[04:07.120 --> 04:11.680]  all the alien stuff, the crafts, the bodies, all that shit is there. The iPhone was made
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.920]  there. I'm just joking with that part. So alien UFO crash, all the stuff gets moved
[04:16.920 --> 04:25.800]  to Area 51. Area 51 is a real US military base. 100% for sure. It's a real military
[04:25.800 --> 04:32.040]  installation and research facility. It absolutely is there. It exists. It's on the map. So much
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.680]  that people are there now. Fences, guards, gates, guns and dogs. So dogs. One day, not
[04:38.680 --> 04:44.160]  so long ago, a guy who I won't say his name went to the bar and had just the right amount
[04:44.160 --> 04:50.200]  of drinks. The exact right number of drinks. And he's already kind of made history. He
[04:50.200 --> 04:54.360]  went home. Yeah, just the right amount of fucking drinks. He went home and he posted
[04:54.360 --> 05:03.640]  to a social media platform that we should raid Area 51 and clap some alien butt cheeks.
[05:03.640 --> 05:07.520]  If we all show up at once, they can't stop us all, right? It's the same theory behind
[05:07.520 --> 05:15.320]  like HempFest. All right. Maybe slightly different, but yes. Okay. If 100,000 people show up to
[05:15.320 --> 05:22.200]  do one, do something together. There's almost nothing that authorities can do to stop that
[05:22.280 --> 05:26.200]  thing from happening. Right. Except this is a military base. I bet there's shit they can do.
[05:26.200 --> 05:31.000]  So they have ways of stopping this. This guy goes online and he decides that he wants to
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.400]  clap some alien butt cheeks. And like Mike said, if I think he said a million people,
[05:35.400 --> 05:41.480]  if we can get a million people, they can't stop us. And so he started what was known as the raid
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.840]  on Area 51. And it was meant to be a joke. It started as just a funny little internet joke.
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.240]  Dude had a funny drunk thought on his way to passing out. And decided to actually share it.
[05:51.240 --> 05:54.680]  Two more beers. He would've got to Pornhub. Four more beers. He wouldn't have made it home from
[05:54.680 --> 05:59.880]  the bar. Three less beers. And he probably would've tried to watch TV instead of Facebook that night.
[05:59.880 --> 06:02.440]  And none of this shit would have happened. Just the right amount of-
[06:02.440 --> 06:04.520]  It's fake. ... beer and burritos.
[06:04.520 --> 06:08.760]  Perfect. Yeah. It all came out just right. So this dude posts this post and it actually caught on.
[06:08.760 --> 06:13.720]  People were like, fuck yeah. The social media network era that we live in.
[06:13.720 --> 06:17.880]  If you don't know what we're talking about, get off and under that fucking rock you've been under.
[06:17.880 --> 06:19.560]  Yeah. Because this has been everywhere for months.
[06:19.560 --> 06:23.000]  So today is the day. He said, let's all gather up-
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.560]  Today's the day. ... at Area 51 and raid Area 51.
[06:27.560 --> 06:31.560]  So eventually the government said, hey fuckers-
[06:31.560 --> 06:35.800]  It happened pretty quick. This blew up fast and the government came out right away and said,
[06:36.600 --> 06:42.600]  by the way folks, this is a real government installation with real rules. And if you try
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.240]  to rush past the gates, we really will use lethal force to stop you.
[06:47.240 --> 06:52.680]  They went so far in their statement as to saying, we don't have rubber bullets here.
[06:52.680 --> 06:56.040]  Yeah. We shoot you with live ammo and you die.
[06:56.040 --> 06:59.800]  They don't use crowd control toys to keep people from rushing onto military installations.
[06:59.800 --> 07:05.400]  Yeah. It's military. This is not a civilian control thing. This is an attack. And you have
[07:05.400 --> 07:10.920]  said raid and attack, we will defend. And they don't fuck around. They got-
[07:10.920 --> 07:13.800]  They don't fuck around at all. Yeah. They will put holes in you.
[07:14.360 --> 07:19.480]  Who knows what they've got there? If this is really the alien storage, whatever,
[07:20.360 --> 07:23.400]  what the fuck do they have there to protect that? They might have a button that they go,
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.520]  doink. At minimum,
[07:24.520 --> 07:28.280]  they've got lots of big guns and a whole lot of medium-sized guns.
[07:28.280 --> 07:33.160]  What I've seen in the press, the dogs that I've seen are enough to keep me the fuck out of there,
[07:33.160 --> 07:34.920]  bro. The dogs are bigger than most of the people that are there right now.
[07:34.920 --> 07:39.880]  The one dog that they showed in the video, the popular one, weighs as much as me. That dog weighs
[07:39.880 --> 07:42.600]  as much as I do. That dog can run- Way bigger teeth.
[07:42.600 --> 07:47.640]  Tackle, destroy. Yeah. I told Mike, I'd rather get shot eight or six times by that fucking gun
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.120]  than take one good lashing from that dog. At least he shoot me with that gun, I'm done. That dog's
[07:52.120 --> 07:55.720]  just going to chew me up and I'm going to cry for a few minutes and I'm going to need stitches and
[07:55.720 --> 07:58.920]  I'm going to bleed and I'm going to be fucking mangled. Just fucking shoot me, please.
[08:00.440 --> 08:04.200]  Anyway, well, let's try to get my high ass a little bit back on track here. Today is the day.
[08:04.760 --> 08:08.600]  Today is the day. They're all gathered up. The government knew we were coming.
[08:08.600 --> 08:13.080]  Yeah, there's like 1500 people is what I was reading in the two little towns closest to Area
[08:13.080 --> 08:20.040]  51 and like 150 or 200 people have made their way down the little dirt ass back roads.
[08:20.040 --> 08:24.600]  So that's another side thing we should touch on. This guy finally realized after the government
[08:24.600 --> 08:30.440]  came out and said, we'll fucking kill you. He went, oh yeah, maybe we shouldn't do that.
[08:30.440 --> 08:37.080]  And so he decided to be a capitalist in a modern day world and turn his prank into
[08:37.080 --> 08:41.480]  a profitable business. And he tried to create a festival out of it. He actually tried to turn
[08:41.480 --> 08:47.000]  it into a music festival. Unfortunately, he was just a drunk dude that posted some shit. So he
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.440]  had no ability to throw a festival. If you build it, sometimes they don't come.
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.400]  Yeah. He did not want to fire everybody up. I haven't read it. You get my fire pun. He didn't
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.360]  want to fire everybody up. Yeah. So he did not do his fire festival. I know, I know. But some
[09:00.360 --> 09:06.360]  other people took it upon themselves to do small local things. This is like 5% of a burning man.
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.160]  Yeah. It's a bunch of, yeah, basically it looks like a bunch of small fish concerts,
[09:11.160 --> 09:15.640]  parking lots happening, little mini burning men's and everybody's got all their alien gear on.
[09:16.200 --> 09:19.800]  Everyone's got blow up alien dolls they're dancing with. It's just all alien to the
[09:19.800 --> 09:26.120]  fuck out or all these places. So they're having a good time. Nobody knows what the plan is.
[09:26.120 --> 09:29.480]  All these people are, yeah, we're here to raid area 51. I'm like, so what are you going to do?
[09:29.480 --> 09:32.040]  Like, I don't know. I don't want to cross that gate. I'm going to get shot.
[09:32.120 --> 09:37.160]  The original internet joke was they were going to rush the buildings at like three in the morning.
[09:37.160 --> 09:44.280]  So we'll wake up tomorrow to either mass casualties as morons rush area 51 or yeah,
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.600]  they didn't do anything other than get a tan. Right. A bunch of tripping hippies get tickets
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.920]  for illegal possession. I saw one guy has already been arrested for peeing near the gate.
[09:54.200 --> 09:58.280]  So, so far at this point, don't pee towards soldiers. It will get you arrested. And about
[09:58.920 --> 10:02.280]  three o'clock in the morning, people started showing up and gathering around the gate.
[10:02.280 --> 10:05.640]  And they were greeted by armed guards who were like, yeah, we know you're coming. Just don't
[10:05.640 --> 10:10.920]  cross this line. You'll be okay. One guy started recording and politely asked one of the guards
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.440]  with the dog, I'm watching on a YouTube live video, like three in the morning. He goes,
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.160]  sir, I'm not going to do it. I just want to know what happens if I cross the line.
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.760]  And the guys weren't like a ninja mask because he's a federal agent. He's all covered up.
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.840]  He removed the mask just far enough to see his mouth clearly. And he smiled and he said,
[10:26.840 --> 10:32.360]  I get to release my dog. And he put his mask up and it wasn't like a, sir, I will be forced
[10:32.360 --> 10:37.640]  to release my animal, sir. I'll be forced to detain you as I get to let my dog eat you.
[10:37.640 --> 10:40.920]  Like he was kind of excited about it. He was like, cross the line, motherfucker. I would
[10:40.920 --> 10:45.480]  really like to let this dog go. We don't train those guys to hand out hugs. Oh no,
[10:45.480 --> 10:50.120]  no. They're not there to be gentle. Like there's one dude in every group that's trying to get
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.720]  first aid, but the rest of them are trying to tear shit into little itty bitty pieces.
[10:56.120 --> 11:02.760]  Yeah. Well, if I told just about any adult male, your job now is to protect the perimeter of this
[11:02.760 --> 11:06.760]  with your life. Most guys take that as like a fun assignment. There's something in you that is like,
[11:06.760 --> 11:12.040]  I'm protective now. I'm primal. This is my property. The thing about guard duty is it's
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.840]  99.9% wishing shit would happen because you're skull fucked board.
[11:18.200 --> 11:22.760]  These guards that I saw, the guards, which I saw in the video were very polite. They were
[11:22.760 --> 11:25.800]  actually friendly and interacting. Some of them, there were different, you can tell,
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.040]  you can tell there were different levels. Well, I'm sure there's a whole bunch of extra people
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.920]  on duty. And so there's gotta be a percentage of them that are just livid, but they've gotta be
[11:34.920 --> 11:37.400]  pulling fucking middle of the night guard duty because of morons on the internet.
[11:37.400 --> 11:41.480]  Funny you said that. The one kid in the interview, he said, sir, what would you rather be
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.000]  doing right now? And he goes, I would've gotten off work about 15 minutes ago. So I'd be getting
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.360]  home to eat dinner and go to bed, man. And he's like, oh, sorry to keep you up. And he goes,
[11:48.360 --> 11:54.040]  it's all right. It's our job. And so there was like four or five agents, whatever in this group,
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.840]  two of them are talkative. The other two stood there like, we don't talk. We're like,
[11:58.840 --> 12:04.040]  we're just looking. You guys talk and look like the reality is that people are idiots.
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.520]  And there's a perfectly reasonable chance that tonight a bunch of people get drunk and like
[12:10.520 --> 12:18.120]  six of them are like, and go fucking tequila running at the gate. Very true. The, the dude
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.920]  who was chummy and talking to people this morning might have to kill like eight idiots tonight.
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.920]  So you never fucking know when you're that guy. I think when he goes for eight, I think once he
[12:28.920 --> 12:33.960]  crosses like the four to five, maybe six threshold, I think it's just happy fire after that, dude.
[12:33.960 --> 12:36.760]  I think he just turned it into the end of fucking true romance at that point.
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.280]  No. Yeah, but you don't, you don't have an assault rifle and you didn't just cross the line. I think
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.040]  there might be something in that man's head that might just accidentally go. They were all coming
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.560]  at me. They, everybody looks like to come in at you. Once you start firing, it's like, once you
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.040]  got a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I think that guy may just enjoy it. So, so far,
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.000]  nothing has happened, but yeah. Like I hope nothing happens tonight. I have no faith tonight.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.920]  It could be the night. Yeah. Tonight could be the night that a bunch of stupid people scratch
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.320]  themselves out of the gene pool. A bunch of people from all across the country, possibly the world
[13:07.320 --> 13:11.560]  who have never been to the desert where it was fucking like 30 degrees last night. And it's
[13:11.560 --> 13:15.880]  going to be 104 today and they're partying and they're not prepared. They're going to be not
[13:15.880 --> 13:19.480]  in their right fucking minds and they're going to be bored and restless by the end of tonight.
[13:19.480 --> 13:25.320]  Some shit could go down by sunrise. The sick part of me is excited. The good wholesome part of me is
[13:25.320 --> 13:30.600]  like, Oh, nothing goes wrong. I could go either way, dude. I like to report good news and I like
[13:30.600 --> 13:36.200]  to see shit happen. So yeah, my kid ain't there. If nothing else, we have some wonderful memes
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.920]  because of it. That is the truth, dude. The past few months of just alien memes, going to collapse
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.400]  some alien butt cheeks have been some funny fucking memes. I don't even drink and I laugh my
[13:45.400 --> 13:51.240]  ass off at them. Yeah, it's all good shit. So there is one good time in my life that alcohol
[13:51.240 --> 13:55.960]  did some good shit. That's all fine. Gave some stupid people running a gunfire. It's not in my
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.600]  life, but this guy nailed it, dude. Shout out to all the people that made the trek to area 51.
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.960]  Next time, make a plan before you drive. It's funny to see everybody just showed up and like,
[14:03.960 --> 14:10.600]  so we're here. Now, why don't we check in? Yeah, exactly. Like, is there a leader? Do we have like
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.960]  a leader and there's no internet service out there? So nobody can, they don't know what to do.
[14:15.960 --> 14:19.240]  It's a bunch of millennials. Honestly, if you and I went out there, we didn't have service. We'd be
[14:19.240 --> 14:23.800]  like, well, now what? Like, what's the next step? Like my phone doesn't work. Usually I go to my
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.640]  phone to find my next move and it's not available. Yeah. It's going to be plenty of funny coming down
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.880]  the pipe from this, as long as a bunch of people don't rush the gates and then an entirely different
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.800]  sort of funny happens. Yeah. I'm the, I was the part of the sick, twisted part of me was going to
[14:39.800 --> 14:45.400]  say, I don't know, Mike, that's when the funny really begins. You just nodded in silence. All
[14:45.400 --> 14:53.080]  right, let's move on from the alien butt cheeks. Let's talk about some real cannabis related stuff.
[14:54.760 --> 14:57.640]  That has to be a cannabis related story, at least tangentially.
[14:58.200 --> 15:01.800]  Yeah. There are people out there smoking weed, smoking some alien OG.
[15:01.800 --> 15:06.040]  Half those memes were inspired by cannabis. The aliens brought us the weed, but no, I'm just
[15:06.040 --> 15:14.040]  kidding. So here's something that has been popping up in the news. Again, I've been avoiding
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.520]  talking about this subject because I am not a doctor. I'm not a scientist, but I've done some
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.440]  reading. Mike brought this up and said, we should talk about this on the show. There is a syndrome,
[15:24.440 --> 15:29.880]  a thing that is happening. It is known, and I'm going to pronounce it incorrectly, but that's okay
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.080]  because if you've never heard the word before, it doesn't matter if I'm saying it wrong or not.
[15:33.160 --> 15:36.680]  It only matters that we're talking about this and giving you the information. I've heard it
[15:36.680 --> 15:41.480]  said a couple of different ways. We're going to talk about a syndrome called Cannabis Hyperemesis
[15:41.480 --> 15:45.960]  Syndrome. I've also heard it pronounced Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome. However you want to say it,
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.600]  we're going to call it CHS for this episode. It's much easier. We'll get much less criticism.
[15:51.480 --> 15:58.360]  There is a syndrome that is being labeled CHS. It is popping up all over the country, but
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.320]  most commonly in places where we have done some sort of cannabis decriminalization and
[16:05.320 --> 16:10.520]  made cannabis available to people. I believe part of that, we're going to get into that.
[16:11.560 --> 16:17.160]  It's not so much localized around legalization. It's just, that's where you read about it.
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.480]  Right. Because the people there can say they consume cannabis.
[16:22.200 --> 16:27.160]  Well, in any place that's legalized, it's invoked to blame every problem you stumble
[16:27.160 --> 16:30.200]  across on legal weed. Lazy docs is my third note.
[16:30.920 --> 16:36.280]  Yeah. But yeah, it's also, we can say, yeah, we do smoke a lot of weed here because you can't say
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.800]  that if you live in some other place. Then also doctors are lazy. They go, you got dreadlocks and
[16:41.800 --> 16:47.960]  smoke a lot of weed. You've got CHS, that's your problem. The symptoms, a lot of times the symptoms
[16:47.960 --> 16:55.000]  include a very crampy stomach and nausea and vomiting and muscle tension and a headache
[16:55.000 --> 17:01.880]  and a burning sensation in your skin or in your body. There are other random symptoms that some
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.320]  patients do report and some patients do not report. Some people feel itchy. Some people
[17:07.320 --> 17:13.160]  feel like their skin is crawly, but the main complaints are stomach problems and an uneasy-
[17:13.160 --> 17:20.440]  Stomach cramps, nausea, repeated bouts of vomiting. And the kicker that the doctors
[17:20.440 --> 17:25.400]  are looking for is if the symptoms are relieved or abated with hot showers.
[17:25.400 --> 17:29.720]  Right. For some reason, it gives you the urge to take a hot shower and the hot showers will help
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.160]  it, which is really weird because one of my favorite things, I just go randomly take a hot
[17:33.160 --> 17:36.040]  shower. I've done that since I was a kid. So I'm like, huh, this is strange.
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.760]  They came across that because when you're writhing in agony or whatever, your mind starts going
[17:40.760 --> 17:45.480]  through the Rolodex. Oh fuck, how do we get this to stop? And one of the things that people have
[17:45.480 --> 17:50.280]  reported that works is hot showers. And so they're doing a couple of different things to
[17:50.280 --> 17:55.080]  treat it. They're doing something with capsaicin and mainly it's just hydrate you and tell you to
[17:55.080 --> 17:59.240]  lay off whatever you've been smoking until the symptoms abate is all anybody's doing.
[17:59.960 --> 18:05.400]  Right. There's not a drug that they found that makes it better or anything like that,
[18:05.400 --> 18:10.120]  that they can give you. It's just, you have to stop consuming cannabis and
[18:10.520 --> 18:14.600]  hydrate and just give it time. And as whatever's in your system passes,
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.520]  they're blaming THC right now, but I really highly doubt that.
[18:20.520 --> 18:26.040]  That's my next note. So pause. Fuck, I forgot what I was going to say because I told you to
[18:26.040 --> 18:31.000]  pause. Where was I, Mike? That's what's up with the syndrome. If you're not familiar with it,
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.120]  you can look CHS up. We're talking about it right now because Jeff said, what do you want to do a
[18:36.680 --> 18:42.200]  show about today? And I said, I remember where I was CHS is in the news. So you'll be able to find
[18:42.200 --> 18:47.480]  out more specific information about it if you'd like. So it's popping up. People are getting CHS,
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.560]  people that have smoked for a long time are suddenly developing CHS. Like they've been,
[18:51.560 --> 18:56.120]  like folks like myself who have smoked for years and years. It's not like 16 year old
[18:56.120 --> 19:01.560]  sneaks out of house, smokes first joint with friends, comes home and has CHS. Right. Well,
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.120]  it could be that could occur as well, but that's a different story.
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.200]  That could occur as well, but that's not as common. No one's reporting that yet.
[19:08.200 --> 19:12.280]  Right. Because they're probably just thinking if that does happen, they also just think I'm
[19:12.280 --> 19:15.880]  just too fucking high for my first time. And it's probably what they attribute that to.
[19:15.880 --> 19:20.680]  So yeah, it is popping up in folks that smoke like myself and Mike's level, like a daily
[19:20.680 --> 19:28.200]  or a frequent or a regular consumer, somebody that smokes a lot. So it's popping up in random places.
[19:28.200 --> 19:33.160]  And the only way to stop it for a short time is these hot showers and then quit smoking and
[19:33.400 --> 19:38.120]  clean out your system. Some people report that it comes back immediately. Some people say that
[19:38.120 --> 19:43.400]  it doesn't come back. Some people say that it will come back later on. So it's strange and random at
[19:43.400 --> 19:48.760]  that sort of a thing. Now, the next thing that we should be, that's part of the reason this has been
[19:48.760 --> 19:56.440]  so hard to nail down and describe is a specific illness or something that's being caused by
[19:56.440 --> 20:03.880]  whatever is because it's characterized by the symptoms we've said. But to get a diagnosis,
[20:04.520 --> 20:08.120]  the people have to go back to the ER over and over and over again with,
[20:08.760 --> 20:12.760]  they showed up because it presents like extreme food poisoning and stomach cramps,
[20:14.280 --> 20:18.120]  which is typically those symptoms are alleviated with hot showers too.
[20:18.840 --> 20:26.680]  It's not until you've come back to the ER three or four times and they start asking about your
[20:26.680 --> 20:33.240]  cannabis use that they decided to diagnose it as CHS and recommend stopping all cannabis
[20:33.240 --> 20:40.520]  consumption to see what that does for several weeks. Oh, excuse that. That was terrible. I'm
[20:40.520 --> 20:46.840]  sorry. I think that a lot of that is a doctor getting lazy and getting tired of seeing you
[20:46.840 --> 20:51.640]  and being like, we don't have a real diagnosis for you. It would be easy just to slap this CHS
[20:51.640 --> 20:55.720]  label on there. So there you go. You say you smoke, that's probably what's doing it.
[20:55.720 --> 21:02.680]  So I think part of that is laziness. What I really think is, excuse my throat, you guys,
[21:02.680 --> 21:08.600]  I apologize for that. That's rude podcaster throat. What I really think is the root cause of
[21:08.600 --> 21:17.320]  CHS is honestly a pesticide exposure. I've got worker protection safety training from the
[21:17.320 --> 21:22.360]  department, the Colorado Department of Agriculture and the Colorado State University of Pueblo.
[21:22.360 --> 21:28.840]  I am train the trainer certified. I am certified in going to anywhere that uses pesticides,
[21:28.840 --> 21:36.120]  any sort of agricultural facility. I can train the staff on pesticide handling and pesticide
[21:36.120 --> 21:42.440]  application and pesticide safety on a professional commercial horticulture level. I understand
[21:42.440 --> 21:47.800]  pesticides. I understand pesticide application. I think I made my point. I've read a lot about
[21:47.800 --> 21:54.440]  pesticides and what happens when you're exposed to them. I think that the symptoms of CHS directly
[21:54.440 --> 22:01.320]  match the symptoms of azadirachtin poisoning and azadirachtin exposure. They're very much
[22:01.320 --> 22:05.160]  the same symptoms. They're parallel. And I think people- How common is this
[22:05.160 --> 22:10.120]  product used in cannabis cultivation? It is one of the most common pesticides.
[22:10.120 --> 22:17.240]  And that's when I first started reading about these cases, I thought, well, it's not the THC
[22:17.240 --> 22:23.480]  because humans have been using THC in concentrated forms. If you don't know the history of cannabis
[22:23.480 --> 22:31.800]  and hash, you can look this shit up. But before the 1920s, eating hash was wildly popular. There's
[22:31.800 --> 22:37.480]  a book called The Hash Eaters. It's even in the Count of Monte Cristo. Eating hash is one of the
[22:37.480 --> 22:47.720]  subplots. And so the odds that there's an illness with symptoms this severe that's caused directly
[22:47.720 --> 22:54.680]  by THC or CBD or one of the other cannabinoids is highly unlikely. What is extremely likely is that
[22:54.680 --> 23:02.680]  there's something that's in common use like neem oil or something else that fucking everybody uses
[23:02.680 --> 23:07.960]  at least for a while. Neem oil is not super popular now, but for a minute, everyone and
[23:07.960 --> 23:13.480]  their brother had neem in their fucking garage. A lot of other folks are attributing neem oil
[23:13.480 --> 23:19.080]  to this syndrome. I think they're attached. I think neem and azadirachtin are the same,
[23:19.080 --> 23:22.360]  if not similar. I should read that before I say that, but they're attached somehow.
[23:25.560 --> 23:30.200]  That's a lot of people's suspect or a lot of people in the cannabis community's
[23:31.160 --> 23:36.680]  prime suspects is something that we're adding to cannabis for one reason or another.
[23:38.840 --> 23:45.160]  This ties in with the vaping story that's going on right now too. There's a concerted effort by
[23:45.160 --> 23:51.800]  people in the media and people in the anti-marijuana world to pin the vaping stuff on
[23:51.880 --> 23:58.120]  THC or vaping period. That's clearly nonsense. It's clearly an additive that's causing this.
[24:00.600 --> 24:04.200]  Not focusing on that's going to cause us problems. Everyone in the community needs
[24:04.200 --> 24:08.600]  to be aware that we're talking about stuff that's being added to our cannabis, not cannabis.
[24:08.600 --> 24:11.560]  I don't want to say added. That's going to sound like it's being added-
[24:12.200 --> 24:14.360]  Sprayed, applied, fed to-
[24:14.360 --> 24:19.960]  It's being sprayed as an intention as a pest preventative or a pest deterrent.
[24:20.520 --> 24:26.440]  And it's being applied too late or too heavily. And it's being applied improperly is basically
[24:26.440 --> 24:30.200]  what's happening. I did a quick Google search. The two main active ingredients derived from the
[24:30.200 --> 24:36.440]  neem tree seeds are azadirachtin and clarified hydrophobic extractive neem oil, also referred to
[24:36.440 --> 24:42.360]  simply as neem oil. So yes, neem and azadirachtin are one and the same, just an extract of the other
[24:42.360 --> 24:47.640]  one. So that's what the symptoms are coming from. When I typed in the word azadirachtin,
[24:47.640 --> 24:51.880]  the first thing that came up were poisoning symptoms. And if you look, it is very similar
[24:51.880 --> 24:58.040]  to what we're looking at with CHS. And then you asked if that is a product that is used-
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.160]  It's used fucking everywhere.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.720]  Everything with AZA at the start of it. And I feel bad mentioning the products,
[25:03.720 --> 25:11.560]  but as a whatever is made with azadirachtin. Yeah. And one of them, two of them, I'm thinking
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.440]  quickly, I can think of at least three azadirachtin derived products that are
[25:17.240 --> 25:21.560]  allowed by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division and the Colorado Department of
[25:21.560 --> 25:25.160]  Agriculture. So I'm going to loop back to something I was talking about a minute ago
[25:25.160 --> 25:31.960]  about improper pesticide application. There is what is known as a re-entry interval when you
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.800]  apply a pesticide. If I spray, most products have a four or an eight hour. Most of the things that
[25:37.800 --> 25:42.280]  I would use have got a four or an eight hour re-entry interval. If I spray that product in
[25:42.280 --> 25:47.640]  my garden, I have to leave. And unless you are in the proper protective equipment, you should not
[25:47.640 --> 25:52.280]  enter that grow room for four to eight hours because that pesticide is active in there.
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.760]  If you touch the plants, you risk getting a pesticide contamination on your skin. If it is
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.240]  still in there, if it was sprayed and micronized bubbles, you can still inhale that into your
[26:01.240 --> 26:08.760]  lungs. You can get exposure. That re-entry interval needs to be lengthened in our indoor
[26:08.760 --> 26:13.400]  grow environments because we don't have wind and we don't have sun. Those pesticides are not getting
[26:13.400 --> 26:19.800]  broken down by the natural environment. It's just hanging out on the plants. So people are spraying
[26:19.800 --> 26:26.200]  too often. When you're spraying outside, shit drips onto the soil, it's going to absorb and
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.680]  diffuse into the topsoil. The sun's going to break it down. The sun is going to destroy most of what
[26:30.680 --> 26:34.120]  we're putting out there. It's going to break it down. Then the rain is going to come, the dew is
[26:34.120 --> 26:40.200]  going to come. The drips gather in the little rain gutters and they just pool. There's no absorption.
[26:40.200 --> 26:45.720]  There's nothing. It just sits. And there's no wind. It's just gathered up. And then we apply
[26:45.720 --> 26:52.440]  again and we apply again and we apply again. And that is where there is too much pesticide
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.880]  gathered up on our flower. Or I've talked about this also in a previous episode. We're taking
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.760]  plants that have been sprayed a little bit too late. Then we're like, shit, man, this crop's got
[27:02.760 --> 27:07.160]  bugs on it and I've been spraying it and I can't get rid of the bugs. And then you make an executive
[27:07.160 --> 27:11.640]  decision around week eight. Man, this can't go 10 weeks. These bugs are going to eat this shit.
[27:11.640 --> 27:12.680]  Got to break it down early.
[27:12.680 --> 27:15.240]  Got to get, but then you know what else we got to do with it? Because it came down early.
[27:15.240 --> 27:16.200]  Turn it into oil.
[27:16.200 --> 27:21.000]  Turn it into oil. But also we just sprayed it four weeks ago, three weeks ago. So now what
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.200]  are we going to do? We're also going to make concentrated azadirachtin in my oil.
[27:26.200 --> 27:26.680]  Yep.
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.720]  Yeah. Sometimes I can see it in some concentrates. I can identify the floaty pesticide.
[27:31.720 --> 27:36.360]  But so you apply that pesticide, you take down the crop a little bit early because it wasn't a plan.
[27:36.360 --> 27:41.000]  You've got bugs. It's got to come down. You've got early flowers. Nobody wants to buy premature
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.560]  flowers. You turn it into concentrate. You've just made concentrate with contaminated flowers.
[27:45.560 --> 27:51.000]  Now you're going to get cannabis hyperemesis syndrome from consuming that azadirachtin
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.680]  laden concentrate. I think that is what's making people sick to tell you the truth.
[27:55.320 --> 28:03.720]  The part of this whole topic that drives me just up the wall is when it's cantaloupe that's making
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.320]  people sick, seven, eight people get sick and we're like, it's Billy's Cantaloupe Farm in
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.840]  Billy, Carolina that produced it and sold it and they fucked up step seven and these people got
[28:16.840 --> 28:23.800]  sick and those families sue the company and life goes on. Because it's a legal regulated product
[28:23.800 --> 28:31.320]  that goes through standard testing and inspections. When stuff sold like that,
[28:31.320 --> 28:37.800]  they can track it back right away. When they had scares in the 80s and the 90s where people
[28:37.800 --> 28:43.240]  fucking with Tylenol bottles and shit on the shelf, when somebody would buy a bottle of
[28:43.240 --> 28:48.840]  Tylenol that had been tampered with, they were immediately able to say that bottle of Tylenol
[28:48.840 --> 28:53.880]  came from Billy's Drugstore. Billy's Drugstore got their shipment of Tylenol from Timmy's
[28:53.880 --> 28:59.240]  Warehouse. Timmy's Warehouse got their shit from Tylenol Factory 17. That's right here.
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.560]  They go to Tylenol Factory 17. They talk to the 15 guys that were working the day that bottle
[29:03.560 --> 29:10.520]  went through the line. That's what legal and regulated means. And as cannabis moves all the
[29:10.520 --> 29:15.320]  way into that market, we're finally going to get the protections that should have fucking been there
[29:15.320 --> 29:20.360]  our whole lives. I've grabbed this concentrate container here on the back of this one. I've got,
[29:20.360 --> 29:26.120]  I'm not going to read the numbers exactly, but I've got an RMCF, an RMIP, and then a couple of
[29:26.120 --> 29:32.600]  other numbers. One of these numbers was the cultivation facility. The RMCF is the recreational
[29:32.600 --> 29:37.240]  marijuana cultivation facility. I've got a number there. So I know where this was cultivated. I know
[29:37.560 --> 29:44.840]  which grow these flowers came from. Then I've got an RMIP, a recreational marijuana infused
[29:44.840 --> 29:49.160]  product facility. Wow. I'm proud of myself for that one. I've got a number there. So I know who
[29:49.160 --> 29:57.640]  grew this and I knew who extracted it. With this RMCF number, if I wanted to, I could request their
[29:57.640 --> 30:03.240]  pesticide application logs, which they're required to keep for a minimum of two years.
[30:03.880 --> 30:09.480]  So if a problem occurred from this batch of concentrate, I could tell you what was applied
[30:09.480 --> 30:15.800]  to their garden for the past two years if they were honest. They're supposed to write all of
[30:15.800 --> 30:21.800]  that shit down. The trick there is just apply some shit and don't write it down. How do we
[30:21.800 --> 30:26.920]  defeat that, Mike? More regs and inspections. More regs, lab testing, and inspections.
[30:27.960 --> 30:32.120]  Now the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division has a couple of new machines that they're just
[30:32.120 --> 30:37.400]  loving to fucking use. They show up to your grow and they dress up like their goddamn CSI,
[30:37.400 --> 30:42.600]  and they go in the grow and they cut off a leaf from one or two plants and they denote plant
[30:42.600 --> 30:47.000]  number six. The numbers are way longer. Yeah, the plants are all tagged with a specific number
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.040]  already. So they just write that number down. Plant number six, the bottom third main branch
[30:52.040 --> 30:56.360]  of the plant. We took this leaf. They put it in a little evidence bag. It says evidence. It looks
[30:56.360 --> 31:01.320]  like a fucking crime bag. They take a few samples throughout the entire grow. They'll just pick
[31:01.320 --> 31:05.880]  random places and they'll take samples and they'll write it down. They get all of the grower
[31:05.880 --> 31:10.760]  information, the owner information. They check so much stuff. Then they take those samples back to
[31:10.760 --> 31:16.280]  a lab and they test them for pesticide contamination. If those plants are tested for improper
[31:16.280 --> 31:21.800]  pesticide application, there are repercussions for that garden. It could be destroyed. The entire
[31:21.800 --> 31:27.720]  garden can be taken down. Yep. Yeah. They'll send people down to watch you shred your shit.
[31:27.720 --> 31:31.160]  They'll help you do it. They'll fucking help you shred those plants.
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.880]  The two people I know that have been through that process,
[31:35.960 --> 31:40.040]  the guys they sent to watch everything get shredded were just asking stupid questions
[31:40.040 --> 31:42.360]  the whole time, making it worse on the people that had to shred it.
[31:42.360 --> 31:46.360]  I bet. Oh man, the MED is a fun group of people. I love you guys at the MED.
[31:46.360 --> 31:53.000]  This is what happens. This is what we mean when we say legal cannabis. Legal beer don't make
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.080]  people sick. If you know the history of prohibition, one of the really fucked up
[31:57.080 --> 32:01.320]  things that happened was a lot of the alcohol people were drinking during prohibition was
[32:01.320 --> 32:09.000]  fucking poison. Why is it poison? Because the black market cares about profit. I get it. I was
[32:11.400 --> 32:15.640]  part of the black market tangentially, fundamentally. That's where I came from.
[32:15.640 --> 32:19.080]  That's why sometimes I try to stand up for the black market. I understand that. I've got
[32:19.080 --> 32:23.240]  compassion for the black market. Without the black market in some places, there is no market.
[32:24.200 --> 32:34.440]  That's 100% true. For the cannabis community, for so long, we had no other option. We made
[32:35.240 --> 32:43.240]  the best black market we could. Everybody trusts and respects their dealer for the most part when
[32:43.240 --> 32:47.080]  it comes to cannabis. I don't think that's necessarily true for a lot of other harder drugs.
[32:49.240 --> 32:53.960]  But a lot of the smokers I know, especially in the black market days, had a fun relationship
[32:53.960 --> 32:59.160]  with whoever their guy was and always went back to that one spot. We've really carried some of
[32:59.160 --> 33:05.480]  that through into the legal market where we pick a dispensary and we stay with that chain or that
[33:05.480 --> 33:11.960]  outfit for as long as we can before changing it up. I think some of that's making some of
[33:11.960 --> 33:18.360]  these little epidemics worse. The CHS thing, if you're buying a product that's tainted with a
[33:18.360 --> 33:25.640]  pesticide from shop A, odds are strong that their whole grow is treated with whatever's making you
[33:25.640 --> 33:30.360]  sick. As you move from flower to flower, concentrate to concentrate, as long as you're
[33:30.360 --> 33:35.720]  going back and buying from that specific store, whatever's in their supply chain that's fucking
[33:35.720 --> 33:41.320]  with you is going to keep fucking with you. Right now, odds are pretty good that it's something that
[33:41.320 --> 33:47.400]  the whole industry is using, legal and illegal. I believe strongly that the whole industry is
[33:47.400 --> 33:52.600]  using azadirachtin-based and neem-based products. Dude, I can be such a strong testament to your
[33:52.600 --> 33:58.360]  loyalty is what you're talking about. Once you do find a shop or a weed guy, you keep going there.
[33:58.360 --> 34:02.440]  If you look at my table, there are two brands all over the table. That's why I stick with them.
[34:02.440 --> 34:09.160]  They've never done me wrong. Shit's always proper and I don't feel sick from it. I've never felt.
[34:10.760 --> 34:14.520]  There are going to be 100 people now that get fucking paranoid from this podcast.
[34:14.520 --> 34:17.560]  I've got this syndrome now. Sorry we did that to you guys. You don't have it. It's okay. Chill out.
[34:17.560 --> 34:25.000]  I am really, really rough on my lungs. I smoke tobacco. Bong hits are my favorite method of
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.880]  consuming cannabis. You've got a reputation for coughing like a fucking savage on the show.
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.760]  I haven't even converted over to concentrates, which if you haven't figured out that vaping
[34:34.760 --> 34:39.400]  concentrates is a lot less wear and tear on your lungs than smoking a joint for the same
[34:40.200 --> 34:42.840]  amount of stone. You're just having to think about it.
[34:44.440 --> 34:49.320]  Still, I prefer bong hits. I don't know why. It's too perfect to give up.
[34:51.080 --> 34:57.800]  I've had vape pens where I take a couple of puffs on it and I just feel like my lungs feel soggy or
[34:57.800 --> 35:04.760]  squishy for the next hour, day and a half. I didn't mind losing those carts. I'm fucking
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.440]  terrible with carts. That's why I don't do them. Oh, the vape pen cartridges? You lose those too?
[35:08.440 --> 35:11.640]  I know a couple other people that are like that. I can keep on doing them.
[35:11.640 --> 35:15.640]  I got seven batteries at home, no carts. I haven't finished a cart in four years.
[35:17.320 --> 35:25.000]  But immediately I knew that that was a product where an industry on the margins or an industry
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.800]  that's squeezed as hard as the legal cannabis industry is, a lot of the carts are where their
[35:31.800 --> 35:38.440]  D minus and failed product ends up. In the black market, who the fuck knows what's in those things?
[35:38.440 --> 35:47.560]  They're finding carts with K2 and spice in it. They found that shit in CBD carts in fucking Texas.
[35:48.360 --> 35:54.760]  They found K2 in the carts. They found that shit in Mass too, I think.
[35:56.200 --> 36:00.520]  Just know if you're buying black market, stick to flower. You can look at flower,
[36:00.520 --> 36:05.800]  you can smell flower, you can see problems with the flower through the bag in a quick transaction.
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.120]  There are ways that we've all learned to protect ourselves buying flower in the black market.
[36:11.640 --> 36:19.320]  Concentrates, if you're buying legit hash, you can look and see quality versus not quality.
[36:19.960 --> 36:24.440]  Once it's in a cart, who the fuck knows? Yeah, that could be piss in there.
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.920]  Now with the dispensaries, they are now... Before I get to the dispensary part,
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.800]  they're now doing concentrate tests. Until recently, I think it may have been September 1st,
[36:33.800 --> 36:37.080]  they did not have to test the concentrates. They were just testing the flower.
[36:37.080 --> 36:42.440]  Just the flower. Now they're also testing a sample of the concentrate. If the concentrate does
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.280]  happen to get an abundance of pesticide concentrated, it'll get noticed now.
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.360]  They're testing for that as well. Another thing that is happening to keep us safer,
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.520]  they are doing random dispensary tests. They're going to dispensaries now.
[36:54.520 --> 36:55.880]  Doing spot check buys? They're doing spot checks.
[36:55.880 --> 36:57.160]  Should have been fucking doing that all along.
[36:57.160 --> 37:03.080]  Not buys. They're going in like health department and checking the flower. They're pulling flower
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.160]  out of the jar and testing it for microbes and pesticides. Yeah, they're doing checks on the
[37:07.160 --> 37:12.360]  actual flower that is in the jar on the shelf now. I see what's happening because shit can happen.
[37:12.360 --> 37:17.800]  You and I know what can happen from the grow because it gets sealed up. Depends on how your
[37:17.800 --> 37:22.840]  grow is. It probably goes in a fucking turkey bag and it gets sealed up in a turkey bag and driven
[37:22.840 --> 37:28.920]  in the back of Mike's car from the grow facility to the dispensary. Then somebody at the dispensary
[37:28.920 --> 37:32.120]  checks it in and puts it into a different container. Then I don't know if it gets sealed
[37:32.120 --> 37:34.200]  airtight, if it gets left open. I don't know what happens.
[37:34.200 --> 37:36.520]  Did that container get washed from the last batch?
[37:36.520 --> 37:37.400]  Did somebody sneeze in it?
[37:37.400 --> 37:41.880]  10 batches before? Did somebody wash their hands after using the shitter before they
[37:42.520 --> 37:50.200]  dumped that bag? All of that. The shit we've seen or talking about in the legal market,
[37:50.200 --> 37:55.480]  has your ears perked up or your gag reflex kicking in? Just imagine the shit we've seen
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.640]  in the purely illegal market. Some dispensaries have a dry it and cure it in the jar sort of a
[38:01.640 --> 38:06.520]  theory. I've been asked to take my shoes off and grind the plant material that was stuck to the
[38:06.520 --> 38:16.360]  bottom of them over a plate, just zero regs for quality control. Everybody I know that's been
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.240]  involved in the black market long enough to do with brick weed has stories about insane shit
[38:21.240 --> 38:25.320]  they found in their brick. Nuts, bolts, a fucking bird.
[38:25.320 --> 38:26.120]  Pine cones.
[38:26.840 --> 38:33.800]  Anything to make it weigh, anything to make it look right. Stuff had soda dumped out over it
[38:33.800 --> 38:38.120]  and then dried in the sun to give it more sticky. That's how they used to compress it. They'd pour
[38:38.120 --> 38:40.840]  sugar water over it and put it in a trash compactor. That's how they used to compress
[38:40.840 --> 38:46.120]  all the Mexican brick weed. There's endless nasty that we've just been like,
[38:46.440 --> 38:53.240]  but it's that or no herb. As legalization takes hold, we can finally get away from some of this
[38:53.240 --> 38:59.400]  shit, but it's always a struggle. It's always a struggle. This vape thing's really going to
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.320]  fucking, everybody's going to take three steps back. Hopefully. There are some people that will
[39:03.320 --> 39:11.400]  not. There are a lot of people pushing, that have just been salivating for their next opportunity.
[39:11.960 --> 39:16.840]  The people who are just livid that we can't arrest anybody who's a minority for smelling like weed
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.880]  right now are fucking thrilled that once this flavored vape thing passed, they could be like,
[39:21.880 --> 39:27.320]  I fucking smelled cupcakes from the sidewalk. So we kicked the door in and arrested everybody.
[39:27.320 --> 39:34.200]  Yeah. That's a little wacky. We just need to, I don't know the solution, but you just got to be
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.880]  careful. We have to educate consumers. You can't bust people for doing something they enjoy.
[39:38.360 --> 39:44.040]  Well, that's it's rethinking a lot of stuff is how we fix that. Like everything about
[39:44.040 --> 39:49.080]  arresting people for consuming substances that makes them happy is fucking just moronic. That's
[39:49.080 --> 39:54.280]  not how cops were designed to work. Cops protect you from me. They can't protect you from you.
[39:54.280 --> 39:57.800]  Absolutely. I agree with that. I just passed Mike a green dot labs,
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.560]  baked pin. I'm not sure what the flavor is of that, but it'll be delicious.
[40:01.960 --> 40:07.240]  So I do preach that we don't need to pay attention to the numbers on the lab test because
[40:07.240 --> 40:11.400]  your nose knows your nose knows what turps and flavors you like and how you're going to get
[40:11.400 --> 40:17.080]  affected by that properly. Your nose knows which product to buy. What I do like about the lab test
[40:17.080 --> 40:21.080]  is that assures me that that product has been through a lab. It has been produced in a quality
[40:21.080 --> 40:26.040]  facility, hopefully by an educated grower, somebody that cares and knows, but most of all,
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.440]  it's been tested. I know it has been through the market. Hopefully it's not super contaminated.
[40:31.560 --> 40:35.400]  If it's in a vape pen, you know that you're getting probably a quality product if it came
[40:35.400 --> 40:39.320]  from the dispensary on the black and white there. And of course, dude, there are going to be bad
[40:39.320 --> 40:46.280]  products that come from the dispensary. Honestly, right now, because we're still
[40:46.280 --> 40:52.200]  operating in a federal gray area and we don't have access to the resources that every other
[40:52.200 --> 40:56.920]  industry has, like Juul knows for a fucking fact that their heating element isn't causing
[40:56.920 --> 41:05.560]  the vaping crisis. Openn is pretty sure. I doubt the people at Green Dot have had that tested.
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.280]  That's just straight up my guess. I could be wrong, but that's my guess.
[41:10.280 --> 41:14.760]  I do not know. I can't speak on that. The smaller the company is, the lower the
[41:14.760 --> 41:21.640]  odds are that they have access to the resources to run the testing to be sure.
[41:22.280 --> 41:26.200]  Now, that doesn't mean that that shit's all that much safer than anything else. It just means they've
[41:26.200 --> 41:30.600]  run more. Are we going to get sued because of this type testing before shit hits the market?
[41:30.600 --> 41:37.640]  I've watched vape pens evolve since they first hit the market here, and
[41:40.120 --> 41:46.120]  their existence now makes me more comfortable than their previous iterations.
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.440]  Right. I knew they were putting the crap in them before.
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.560]  The original vaporizers, the tabletops, the volcanoes, those have been around since the
[41:53.560 --> 41:59.320]  late 90s. If they were making people sick, we'd fucking know it. Some of the medical studies have
[41:59.320 --> 42:04.840]  been done on volcano vaporizers with people sitting in hospital rooms vaping specific
[42:04.840 --> 42:09.880]  amounts of product through volcanoes. We would be fucking sure if the act of heating cannabis to
[42:09.880 --> 42:16.440]  the vaporization point caused lung problems. But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[42:16.440 --> 42:24.040]  Lung problems. But as soon as we went to the carts, batteries started exploding.
[42:25.720 --> 42:30.680]  What's going into the cart was a big question. Carts melting and leaking everywhere.
[42:30.680 --> 42:31.000]  Dude, we worked with a guy.
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.040]  Or not heating up enough to cook what's in them.
[42:34.040 --> 42:38.680]  We used to work with a good friend who smoked the, I called it the robot dick. It was just
[42:38.680 --> 42:42.520]  a nicotine vape. I'll turn you down a little bit. Go ahead and choke to death. I would watch him,
[42:43.480 --> 42:49.000]  and I'm not against your vape. If that's what you want to do, vape away, brah, or lady, brah.
[42:49.000 --> 42:55.080]  He would get his vape thing and he had this, looked like a piece of fucking a cut up sock.
[42:55.080 --> 42:59.640]  And he would just pour this liquid fucking syrupy shit into there and then close it up.
[42:59.640 --> 43:03.240]  And he would push the battery on it and it would fucking sparkle and crackle and fireworks would
[43:03.240 --> 43:07.480]  come out of it. And he'd go, just right, bro. And he would hit it. And he would take these big old
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.160]  cloudy rips out of it. And he'd make this face like it was heaven. And he would blow out. I hated
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.680]  how good it smelled, bro. It smelled like, well, dude, nicotine's a hell of a drug. But it also
[43:18.680 --> 43:24.040]  smelled like cupcakes and fucking cotton candy and fucking heaven. And I was like, God, how did
[43:24.040 --> 43:30.120]  you just smoke that? But it worried, I was thinking like, bro, you're pouring some liquid
[43:30.120 --> 43:36.760]  juice from China that just says like fizzy cupcake e-juice. How do we know what's in there?
[43:36.760 --> 43:40.920]  And then he would just rip it and it would smell so strong. And I'm like, how many chemicals did
[43:40.920 --> 43:47.480]  it take to smell? Right. If it smells good over here, five minutes later, what went through that
[43:47.480 --> 43:51.000]  lung tissue? The bottle said strawberry cheesecake. And when he hit it, I went,
[43:51.560 --> 43:54.520]  bro, is that strawberry cheesecake? And he goes, exactly. And I'm like,
[43:54.520 --> 43:57.960]  what kind of chemicals are in there? Like what kind of science shit? Like you're going to die
[43:57.960 --> 44:03.240]  from that. It was the, it was toast with butter and jam was the one that was, I was like, dude,
[44:03.240 --> 44:07.080]  it's got multiple flavors. There's who knows what the fuck is in all that mess.
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.160]  But I don't think it's that shit that's making people sick. It's something that it looks like
[44:13.160 --> 44:20.280]  it's specifically something they're using to cut down cannabis oil because in its pure form,
[44:20.920 --> 44:31.080]  if you get 90%, 95% pure THC oil, that's just like cold honey. It just doesn't work in a car.
[44:31.080 --> 44:34.440]  Proving that some of those were done, some of the damage and the harm and the
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.120]  problems with the hospitalizations were caused by a vitamin E cut.
[44:38.120 --> 44:43.880]  They think, but they're still not sure. Because this is all, well, one of the first things they
[44:43.880 --> 44:50.120]  realized was the people that are getting sick aren't buying regulated shit. Because if it was,
[44:51.960 --> 44:55.960]  I say Juul, because they're the most popular one, but if it was like Juul's blackberry flavor,
[44:56.920 --> 45:01.000]  that would have come to light a long fucking time ago, just like it does with the cantaloupe.
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.880]  You never see a food outbreak with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sick people,
[45:05.880 --> 45:13.560]  even though they're recalling tons of food. You'll see a million pounds of hamburger got recalled.
[45:13.560 --> 45:20.360]  One guy got sick. Three guys got sick. They got a recall 200 million pounds of fucking cantaloupe,
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.000]  like cantaloupe from an entire region because the factory they went through it failed the test.
[45:26.920 --> 45:33.240]  If what was causing these products was coming from the legal market, it would have been traced
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.760]  back already. It's something that people are buying online to cut in their garage before they
[45:38.760 --> 45:43.320]  sell black market cards. It's fucking cheap and nasty. I'm glad we don't have to deal with that
[45:43.320 --> 45:49.160]  shit. Yeah. If I didn't have these pens, there's one other brand I would probably trust. But if I
[45:49.160 --> 45:52.520]  didn't have these, I wouldn't even be smoking them, dude. I mainly bought these for a concert.
[45:52.840 --> 45:58.440]  Yep. And big shout out to the concerts for just not even giving a shit. I set multiple vape pins
[45:58.440 --> 46:01.400]  in that little basket because you got to walk through a metal detector and they give you the
[46:01.400 --> 46:05.960]  little basket like you're going on a plane and you put your wallet and your keys and your phone
[46:05.960 --> 46:08.360]  in this little basket. I just set them right in there. And the guy looked at me like three of
[46:08.360 --> 46:12.120]  them. Yeah, it's going to be a long night. And he's like, okay, just give me my shit.
[46:13.080 --> 46:16.920]  One of the things that always makes me laugh when I see people ranting and raving about how
[46:16.920 --> 46:22.440]  marijuana causes violence, it's like security guards and the cops would fucking be aware by
[46:22.440 --> 46:28.200]  now. When they see a bunch of joints or a vape pen, they just kind of nod and smile.
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.000]  I'm a big dude. You're a big dude. We both tell each other stories of when I used to drink,
[46:33.000 --> 46:38.600]  some of our favorite stories to tell. The reason I don't drink and I have shame in this, but I'm an
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.560]  adult now so I can talk about it. I like to fucking beat people up when I drink. I don't know
[46:43.560 --> 46:49.560]  why. There's something about alcohol that I can drink a few beers, but then there's one, and I
[46:49.560 --> 46:54.280]  don't know if it's going to be the seventh or the 31st beer, but one of them, I'll take a drink of
[46:54.280 --> 46:59.160]  it and I'll just decide, let's go fight somebody. I don't know who, I don't know why, but something
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.480]  in my brain decides- You're definitely not alone in this.
[47:01.480 --> 47:02.920]  Punching stuff. Yeah, yeah. So that's why I've chosen-
[47:02.920 --> 47:05.960]  Lots of people feel that way. No alcohol for me. Dude, I'm six, five,
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.680]  and 200 pounds and you're fucking six, four, and a lot of pounds.
[47:10.680 --> 47:12.840]  Big enough to accidentally really hurt somebody.
[47:12.840 --> 47:16.680]  Yeah, yeah. And us together drinking and causing problems would be fucking chaos. I'm not trying to
[47:16.680 --> 47:19.800]  say I'm tough or anything. I'm just saying I know that I could cause a problem for myself and others
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.840]  with alcohol in my life. When I smoke cannabis, I produce a quality podcast that teaches others
[47:24.840 --> 47:28.840]  how to improve their lives and grow better with cannabis. And fucking my friends all like me.
[47:28.840 --> 47:33.880]  I don't wake up in the morning wondering, oh, where's my car? How did I get home? Where's my
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.960]  wallet? How much money is left in my wallet? I don't have to go through my phone and see what
[47:37.960 --> 47:41.240]  kind of stupid ass text messages I sent to anybody last night. It's so much easier.
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.480]  Yeah, I've never woken up the next morning and discovered I spent all the money for the rest of
[47:45.480 --> 47:52.040]  the week on weed. I knew that the day I bought the weed going into the transaction, it wasn't
[47:52.040 --> 47:55.800]  something that surprised the fuck out of me the next morning when I was trying to buy breakfast.
[47:55.800 --> 48:01.640]  I like waking up from the bar the next morning going, where the fuck is my everything?
[48:02.920 --> 48:05.640]  Oh, shit. See, I really didn't like that. That's why I quit.
[48:05.640 --> 48:08.840]  No, I didn't. I didn't like that feeling at all. I was just kind of being a smart ass there.
[48:09.080 --> 48:14.920]  But I've never seen a security guard freak out over herb unless they came up to you and were
[48:14.920 --> 48:22.440]  like, quit smoking it in here, like two or three times in a row during one set. Then maybe.
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.080]  There were some kids at Red Rocks one year, some younger security guards that were younger than me
[48:27.080 --> 48:30.760]  that told me, you got to put your weed out. And I was like, bro, it's Red Rocks. And this was
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.560]  before they got all... Red Rocks is different now. Now you got to put your weed out. They'll
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.560]  fuck with you now. Back in the day, I was like, bro, this is Red Rocks. And he goes, you just got
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.960]  to put it out, man, or put it in the bag. And he had a trash bag. He was taking shit from people.
[48:41.960 --> 48:45.560]  And I go, here, bro. And I just gave him a joint. I go, leave me alone. He goes, okay. And he let
[48:45.560 --> 48:49.560]  me smoke after that. He just wanted some weed from people. He didn't give a shit. He was just
[48:49.560 --> 48:53.960]  trying to be a tough ass, tell me to put it out or take it from me so that he could get some weed.
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.120]  I gave him a joint and he let us smoke all night. Didn't say shit. They aren't worried. We're
[48:58.120 --> 49:02.360]  peaceful folk, most of us. There's an asshole in every group. Don't get me wrong. No, just be
[49:02.440 --> 49:11.400]  smart when you're buying shit, people. As this stuff develops, follow the stories and watch.
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.760]  Cannabis, CHS, Cannabis Hypermesis Syndrome is going to get tracked back to something we're
[49:16.760 --> 49:23.480]  spraying. The vaping issue and the CHS issue are two different stories, by the way. We talked about
[49:23.480 --> 49:29.960]  both of them, two different things. It's the same cause. Bullshit is the cause. It's improper
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.200]  cannabis procedures. Black market shadiness and lazy, stupid reporters.
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.200]  The CHS and the vape pins are not related. Those are two separate stories that we may
[49:38.200 --> 49:40.600]  have blended together here at the end of the high part of the talk.
[49:40.600 --> 49:45.320]  They have a lot to do with each other. Also, big, giant shout out and thank you
[49:45.320 --> 49:51.560]  for all of the feedback on the vape episode. I got a lot of great response to that. You gave
[49:51.560 --> 49:54.680]  me positive feedback. You're like, I wish you would have said more of this, but good job.
[49:55.960 --> 49:59.880]  There's a lot of stuff I wish I would have said. You can see how many notes I take. I write down
[49:59.960 --> 50:06.520]  four words for notes on this podcast. I like to make it feel like we're just talking. I used to
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.920]  type it out and fucking, today on the podcast, we will talk about growing cannabis. The basics of
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.040]  growing cannabis come from, that's so boring and it feels so stale. If that's what you're looking
[50:14.040 --> 50:17.560]  for, there's a couple of people doing it, I'm sure. Yeah. I want to have a conversation with
[50:17.560 --> 50:22.760]  you. Sometimes I miss some things. Sometimes I talk way too long on other things, but I got a
[50:22.760 --> 50:26.680]  lot of great feedback. A lot of people said that I missed a couple of things. A lot of people said
[50:26.680 --> 50:33.480]  I got great shit. The main thing people wanted me to make sure that I mentioned was that it is all
[50:33.480 --> 50:39.320]  black market shit and they don't think that any of it is vape, pen or e-juice. It's all black market,
[50:39.320 --> 50:43.800]  concentrate pens is what most of the information that I got back was. They wanted me to make sure
[50:43.800 --> 50:47.400]  to stand up for the nicotine side of it is what I think most people were saying.
[50:47.400 --> 50:51.640]  But I got a lot of great feedback. The YouTube comments were great. The emails were great.
[50:51.640 --> 50:56.440]  Thank you guys. The support, the feedback, just know you guys are listening. It's fucking cool.
[50:57.240 --> 51:02.040]  Yeah. We're growing, bro. The podcast is getting huge. Our listens on YouTube are multiplying.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.320]  If social media would be nicer to us cannabis folks, we could really blow it up a little more.
[51:07.320 --> 51:13.000]  Social media is evil. Evil. I've got mixed feelings on that. See, a lot of people think
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.920]  we should be able to post whatever we want. I understand that social media platforms are owned
[51:16.920 --> 51:20.680]  by other people who have a lot of fucking lawyers and they can say, oh, you don't like the rules
[51:20.680 --> 51:25.400]  here? Don't play here. It's that simple. If I went to the UFC and I was like, hey,
[51:26.040 --> 51:30.520]  I'm pretty and skinny. So no punches to the face for this fight. Dana White would look at me and
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.520]  punch me straight in the face. He'd go, bro, that's the UFC. Smack. And I'd go, oh yeah,
[51:34.520 --> 51:38.200]  I don't get to make the rules here. That's how it is. That's how social media platforms are.
[51:38.200 --> 51:41.160]  You signed a little thing. You don't sign it. You clicked a little thing when you signed up that
[51:41.160 --> 51:45.400]  said, I won't post dumb shit. And they get to decide what dumb shit is. And if they decide
[51:45.400 --> 51:48.600]  that your picture of your puppy is dumb shit or your picture of your weed is dumb shit,
[51:48.600 --> 51:53.560]  that's up to them. You can't do shit about it. So I understand that aspect. Also, I come from
[51:53.560 --> 51:57.400]  the black market we spoke of earlier. I'm not even supposed to be able to post fucking pictures
[51:57.400 --> 52:01.240]  of my weed. I'm supposed to hide in the shadows and nobody should know who I am. Nobody should
[52:01.240 --> 52:05.080]  know that I'm growing. Yeah. We're posting pictures of weed. Shut the fuck up and be happy
[52:05.080 --> 52:09.800]  about it. And if you really want to post your cannabis and you're afraid of your account getting
[52:09.800 --> 52:15.320]  taken down by any sort of social media police, join me on Cannabuzz. Cannabuzz-
[52:15.320 --> 52:19.000]  Where you can get away with that. Yeah. We encourage you. We promote your cannabis
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.440]  photos. You can't buy or sell or trade cannabis there, but if you post the photos,

[52:26.680 --> 52:30.440]  community happening on Cannabuzz. It's a free social media application available on your
[52:30.440 --> 52:35.480]  Android or Apple device. That was a smooth segue for a great commercial. Big shout out to my buddy
[52:35.480 --> 52:41.480]  Q Grows. Support Cannabuzz. It's fun. I'm on there a lot. Find us, Cannabuzz. All right. I just
[52:41.480 --> 52:46.520]  stirred that a whole weird direction. Just don't assume when social media is the same as news.
[52:47.240 --> 52:50.120]  Oh, thank you, Mike. Social media is not news. There's-
[52:50.680 --> 52:55.000]  When I say social media is evil, it's not because it won't let you post weed photos. It's because
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.920]  it's making society fucking dumber. It is. It's making us that R word we're not supposed to
[53:00.920 --> 53:06.760]  fucking say. It is retarding us from actually learning the truth because we are so distracted
[53:06.760 --> 53:12.280]  by memes and just fucking headlines that we don't read any articles anymore. Or nobody-
[53:12.520 --> 53:19.000]  When we were little, there was a bright, clear line between news and opinion.
[53:21.000 --> 53:29.400]  The news is Yankees 4, Red Sox 6. The opinion is Yankees suck, Red Sox suck.
[53:30.680 --> 53:35.160]  Both of those are fun and interesting and important and both have a place.
[53:36.040 --> 53:44.680]  But when you confuse A for B and B for A, bad shit happens. Really bad shit. Even when we're
[53:44.680 --> 53:50.840]  just talking baseball. We brought fucking smallpox in the play bag, people. We're like
[53:51.640 --> 53:54.840]  five years from shitting on our own drinking water again if we don't turn this shit around.
[53:56.280 --> 53:58.840]  You heard it here first. Do you feel better?
[53:59.400 --> 54:01.480]  I do. Is this the section that we call,
[54:01.480 --> 54:07.160]  what really grinds Mike's gears? Sure. I love social media, but fuck people are stupid.
[54:07.160 --> 54:10.520]  Well, I've got a huge love hate. I can't stay there for too long. It's something to do when
[54:10.520 --> 54:14.280]  you're pooping. You just get in there and you fucking release some shit and fill right back
[54:14.280 --> 54:17.960]  up with more shit from the social media and then you get out of there. It's just a trade.
[54:18.680 --> 54:21.320]  I like to post and get out. Trading actual shit for digital shit.
[54:21.320 --> 54:24.760]  And if I don't reply to all your social media nonsense, it's because I'm living.
[54:24.760 --> 54:27.960]  Yeah. If you don't agree with me, you can find me on social media.
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.760]  All right, Mike, we've given the people a good solid hour of podcasting.
[54:32.760 --> 54:35.640]  You're welcome. Dude, thanks for coming and hanging out in the afternoon.
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.480]  Oh yeah. This was random. We did not get interrupted by the UPS guy.
[54:39.480 --> 54:43.480]  We made it. We dodged both our possible distractions. Now let's put that out there.
[54:43.480 --> 54:49.560]  UPS guy or and or gal, please deliver my new stuff that I ordered. Thank you.
[54:50.360 --> 54:54.360]  Thank you world. Thanks for having me, bud. Hey dude, anytime. Come and do more shows.
[54:54.360 --> 54:57.560]  The world likes having you or if they not, if they don't like it, we're going to hear from
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.000]  pretty soon because I'm going to request that they leave us comments on the YouTube channel.

[55:41.320 --> 55:45.480]  this microphone cover that I was pretty fucking disgusted by. So as soon as we're done with this
[55:45.480 --> 55:48.920]  episode, it's coming off and it's getting a new cover. That was gross. I'm glad I shared that with
