[00:01.850 --> 00:24.850]  It's time for episode number 179 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.850 --> 00:25.850]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.850 --> 00:26.850]  That's right.
[00:26.850 --> 00:31.610]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:31.610 --> 00:35.650]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current
[00:35.650 --> 00:39.690]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.690 --> 00:40.690]  I'm your host.
[00:40.690 --> 00:41.690]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[00:41.690 --> 00:43.570]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.570 --> 00:46.890]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.890 --> 00:49.690]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.690 --> 00:53.370]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.370 --> 00:54.370]  Yeah.
[00:54.370 --> 00:57.610]  I hope you guys are joining me on a smoke session right now.
[00:57.610 --> 01:01.290]  I just got done smoking some huge dabs of Cascade Shatter.
[01:01.290 --> 01:03.290]  The Cascade was grown by me.
[01:03.290 --> 01:07.210]  The extraction was done by our friend, the Barefoot Grower, and I'm smoking through my
[01:07.210 --> 01:12.930]  Hitman Hammerhead Rig with a brand new Quartz Banger from our friends at Elevate Glass.
[01:12.930 --> 01:13.930]  Big shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[01:13.930 --> 01:15.250]  I stopped by Elevate today.
[01:15.250 --> 01:18.490]  I had to replace a few nails and carb caps and such.
[01:18.490 --> 01:21.690]  I went in there thinking I was going to buy two things and I walked out there with a whole
[01:21.690 --> 01:22.690]  bag of goodies.
[01:22.690 --> 01:23.690]  Nice work, you guys.
[01:23.690 --> 01:25.970]  I took all my money today.
[01:25.970 --> 01:29.610]  Big shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass at 517 South Dahoan.
[01:29.610 --> 01:30.610]  Go visit them.
[01:30.610 --> 01:33.610]  If you need a new rig, if you need a carb cap, if you need a nail, if you need an e-nail,
[01:33.610 --> 01:35.490]  they had all kinds of great new shit in there today.
[01:35.490 --> 01:38.210]  You can make that an e-nail that you can operate with your iPhone.
[01:38.210 --> 01:39.410]  You can change the lighting scheme.
[01:39.410 --> 01:41.450]  It had a light of every color on top of it.
[01:41.450 --> 01:44.370]  You can open up this app on your phone and you can make that thing look like a damn light
[01:44.370 --> 01:45.370]  show at a Phish concert.
[01:45.370 --> 01:46.370]  It's pretty awesome.
[01:46.370 --> 01:48.370]  Shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[01:48.370 --> 01:49.370]  Go check them out.
[01:49.370 --> 01:51.010]  517 South Dahoan in Colorado Springs.
[01:51.010 --> 01:55.490]  Also, since we're doing shout outs, huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:55.490 --> 01:59.590]  You guys, I'm wearing this Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie and I am nice and warm.
[01:59.590 --> 02:02.890]  It is super cold here in Colorado, but I am not shivering at all.
[02:02.890 --> 02:03.890]  These hoodies look great.
[02:03.890 --> 02:07.210]  If you need some artwork done, if you need shirts, if you need hoodies, if you need stickers,
[02:07.210 --> 02:11.090]  if you need hat pins, I highly recommend my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:11.090 --> 02:14.370]  That's right, HandmadeApparel.biz for all your custom printing needs.
[02:14.370 --> 02:15.370]  Check them out.
[02:15.370 --> 02:17.610]  Let them know that you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and tell them Rasta
[02:17.610 --> 02:18.610]  Jeff sent you.
[02:18.610 --> 02:22.850]  They will take very good care of you getting all of your printing work done.
[02:22.850 --> 02:27.330]  Also, since we're doing shout outs, holy crap, you guys, I've been talking about Patreon
[02:27.330 --> 02:28.930]  for the past few weeks on the podcast.
[02:28.930 --> 02:30.250]  I've got a Patreon account.
[02:30.250 --> 02:32.770]  Let me explain Patreon really quickly.
[02:32.770 --> 02:37.330]  Patreon is a website where people can go and they can sign up to financially contribute
[02:37.330 --> 02:38.330]  to the podcast.
[02:38.330 --> 02:44.010]  You sign up, you put in your credit card info, and once a month it will pay me the amount
[02:44.010 --> 02:49.130]  that you have decided to give me or donate to me or contribute to me.
[02:49.130 --> 02:50.410]  Yesterday I got an email.
[02:50.410 --> 02:54.250]  Somebody has decided that every month they are going to contribute $10 to the Grow From
[02:54.250 --> 02:55.650]  Your Heart podcast.
[02:55.650 --> 02:57.910]  One person is throwing down $10 every month.
[02:57.910 --> 02:58.910]  That is awesome.
[02:58.910 --> 02:59.910]  Huge shout out to that person.
[02:59.910 --> 03:02.910]  I don't know if you want your name said on the show, so I'm not going to call you out.
[03:02.910 --> 03:04.430]  If you'd like your name said on the show, let me know.
[03:04.430 --> 03:07.630]  I will certainly say it for you because I appreciate that.
[03:07.630 --> 03:11.870]  Huge shout out to everybody that has thrown down a Patreon contribution.
[03:11.870 --> 03:13.510]  Those roll through on the first of the month.
[03:13.510 --> 03:15.870]  I get them around the third into my PayPal account.
[03:15.870 --> 03:17.150]  I truly appreciate that.
[03:17.150 --> 03:19.030]  You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast.
[03:19.030 --> 03:24.350]  Like I've said many times, I'm using the Patreon contributions to cover the cost of my website
[03:24.350 --> 03:26.870]  and it will also replace some recording equipment.
[03:26.870 --> 03:31.270]  My SD card from my Zoom H6 took a shit, so I will use the funds to replace that.
[03:31.270 --> 03:33.310]  We can do more podcasts on the road.
[03:33.310 --> 03:34.710]  I buy these little microphone covers.
[03:34.710 --> 03:35.710]  I'm going to rub it.
[03:35.710 --> 03:37.670]  This little foam microphone cover here.
[03:37.670 --> 03:41.470]  I buy a lot of those because I try to give a fresh foamy cover.
[03:41.470 --> 03:44.810]  When the guests come over, I try to have a fresh foam cover on there because people cough
[03:44.810 --> 03:48.630]  into it and people rub their faces on it on accident because they forget the mics there
[03:48.630 --> 03:49.630]  and they bump into it like that.
[03:49.630 --> 03:53.390]  I spend the money on these little foam covers and stuff like that.
[03:53.390 --> 03:54.390]  Eventually I'm going to need a new MacBook.
[03:54.390 --> 03:56.550]  I feel this one's starting to slow down and glitch out.
[03:57.230 --> 03:59.190]  That's where that funding will go, you guys.
[03:59.190 --> 04:01.110]  Huge thank you to those people that contributed to Patreon.
[04:01.110 --> 04:02.350]  I truly appreciate it.
[04:02.350 --> 04:06.190]  The person that just threw down $10 per month, that is super amazing.
[04:06.190 --> 04:07.190]  Thank you.
[04:07.190 --> 04:13.210]  If you want more information on Patreon, go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[04:13.210 --> 04:15.590]  All the information you want is right there on the screen.
[04:15.590 --> 04:17.470]  All right, you guys.
[04:17.470 --> 04:21.350]  Let's get down to the ... Music won't turn down.
[04:21.350 --> 04:22.350]  The mixer's down.
[04:22.350 --> 04:23.350]  There we go.
[04:23.350 --> 04:24.350]  Let's get down to business, you guys.
[04:24.590 --> 04:28.030]  Today we are going to talk about proper mixing and watering techniques.
[04:28.030 --> 04:31.790]  Somebody was asking me questions about mixing their nutrients and mixing their water.
[04:31.790 --> 04:34.750]  Then I got a tweet about mixing nutrients and mixing water.
[04:34.750 --> 04:37.470]  I thought this would be a great episode to do.
[04:37.470 --> 04:42.030]  I also have a friend starting a brand new hydro setup and he needed some advice.
[04:42.030 --> 04:45.470]  Since I was going to talk about it, I figured let's put a microphone in front of my face
[04:45.470 --> 04:46.470]  and do it properly.
[04:46.470 --> 04:51.110]  Today's podcast is going to be about properly mixing your nutrients.
[04:51.110 --> 04:54.470]  Then we're going to talk a little bit about properly watering your plants.
[04:54.470 --> 04:56.230]  All right, you guys.
[04:56.230 --> 05:00.750]  Before I get too far into this, I want to say that this advice should work for small
[05:00.750 --> 05:02.190]  gardens, large gardens.
[05:02.190 --> 05:05.310]  This should work for soilless and soil gardens.
[05:05.310 --> 05:07.310]  This also should work for hydro gardens.
[05:07.310 --> 05:11.070]  Of course, there will be some adjusting to be done for different applications, but most
[05:11.070 --> 05:13.630]  of this will apply to most gardens.
[05:13.630 --> 05:19.470]  If you're running a TLO or a no-till or a living soil, this probably won't work for
[05:19.470 --> 05:20.470]  you.
[05:20.830 --> 05:23.990]  If you're running a no-till and TLO guys, we'll get Frosty Organics back, we'll get
[05:23.990 --> 05:27.350]  Barefoot back, and we'll do another show about that organic stuff.
[05:27.350 --> 05:30.990]  For now, we're going to talk about mixing with bottles and such.
[05:30.990 --> 05:33.270]  My first point will be clean water.
[05:33.270 --> 05:35.030]  Good water is very important.
[05:35.030 --> 05:38.110]  Reverse osmosis water, RO water is ideal.
[05:38.110 --> 05:41.790]  I understand that not everybody can get an RO machine and install it in their bathroom
[05:41.790 --> 05:43.550]  or in their kitchen for their home grow.
[05:43.550 --> 05:44.550]  I do get it.
[05:44.550 --> 05:48.430]  If you can't do RO water, tap water is okay.
[05:48.430 --> 05:53.110]  If you're using tap water, I would recommend that you go to either the pet store like the
[05:53.110 --> 05:58.470]  fish tank store or either the hydroponic store and get yourself an aquarium air pump.
[05:58.470 --> 06:00.750]  This is a pump that sits outside of the water.
[06:00.750 --> 06:01.990]  It does not go in the water.
[06:01.990 --> 06:02.990]  Don't put it in the water.
[06:02.990 --> 06:03.990]  It will kill it.
[06:03.990 --> 06:04.990]  You might electrocute yourself.
[06:04.990 --> 06:05.990]  It'll be bad.
[06:05.990 --> 06:06.990]  Don't do that.
[06:06.990 --> 06:10.230]  It's a pump that goes outside of the water, and it's got a line that runs to an air stone.
[06:10.230 --> 06:13.550]  You'll need to buy some clear line, some flex hose, or some clear line.
[06:13.550 --> 06:15.670]  They'll have the right size line sitting right next to the pump.
[06:15.670 --> 06:16.670]  Don't worry.
[06:16.790 --> 06:20.870]  Then you'll need air stones to put in the bottom of your reservoir.
[06:20.870 --> 06:22.430]  You'll fill up your container.
[06:22.430 --> 06:24.590]  You put the aquarium air pump next to it.
[06:24.590 --> 06:28.470]  It's a good idea to have the aquarium air pump higher than your water because if the
[06:28.470 --> 06:32.750]  power does go out, you don't want water siphoning down the line and coming out at the other
[06:32.750 --> 06:33.750]  end.
[06:33.750 --> 06:34.750]  That has happened before.
[06:34.750 --> 06:36.790]  Keep the pump higher than the water.
[06:36.790 --> 06:37.790]  Get it on a shelf.
[06:37.790 --> 06:41.710]  Don't put it on the ground because it can work as a siphon if the power goes out.
[06:41.710 --> 06:43.310]  You've got your filled container.
[06:43.310 --> 06:44.830]  You've got your aquarium air pump.
[06:44.990 --> 06:48.310]  You've got your plastic line going to some air stones.
[06:48.310 --> 06:52.390]  Those air stones go in the bottom of that container that's filled with water.
[06:52.390 --> 06:53.870]  You plug it in, and it simply bubbles.
[06:53.870 --> 06:54.870]  I turn it up all the way.
[06:54.870 --> 06:55.870]  It might get loud.
[06:55.870 --> 06:58.470]  It'll just be like, just turn it up.
[06:58.470 --> 07:02.550]  It'll bubble, and it'll bubble, bubble, bubble that chlorine out of your water.
[07:02.550 --> 07:06.830]  Hopefully, within 24 to 48 hours, you'll get rid of most of that chlorine.
[07:06.830 --> 07:12.390]  There are some things that can only be taken out by reverse osmosis, but honestly, if you
[07:12.390 --> 07:16.870]  are running a home grow, and your grow is not large enough to where you've got extra
[07:16.870 --> 07:21.910]  money to invest in an RO machine, you're probably going to be okay using tap water.
[07:21.910 --> 07:24.270]  It's not that major of a deal.
[07:24.270 --> 07:29.270]  One thing I should mention is if you're using tap water, you can use less CalMag than if
[07:29.270 --> 07:31.670]  you're using reverse osmosis water.
[07:31.670 --> 07:35.590]  The tap water already has plenty of calcium in it, so you can reduce that.
[07:35.590 --> 07:39.850]  If you're using RO, you need to use the recommended amount or pretty close to it.
[07:39.850 --> 07:41.890]  That's the major difference.
[07:41.890 --> 07:46.770]  You should be okay if you can't use reverse osmosis water is what I'm getting at.
[07:46.770 --> 07:49.490]  Now let's talk about the temperature of your water.
[07:49.490 --> 07:53.490]  It's very important that when you're mixing your nutrients, you have your water between
[07:53.490 --> 07:56.170]  65 and 75 degrees.
[07:56.170 --> 07:58.730]  That's best for your pH and for your nutrients.
[07:58.730 --> 08:03.890]  If you're going hydro, I can say that if you go anywhere above 70, you do encourage algae
[08:03.890 --> 08:05.050]  growth.
[08:05.050 --> 08:08.530]  If you're going hydro, try to keep your water around 70 degrees.
[08:08.530 --> 08:10.850]  If you're going soil, soil is mixed.
[08:10.850 --> 08:12.970]  65 to 75 works.
[08:12.970 --> 08:14.450]  70 is about ideal.
[08:14.450 --> 08:15.690]  65 is a little low.
[08:15.690 --> 08:17.970]  I would never go lower than 65.
[08:17.970 --> 08:22.010]  If you water your plants with water that's cooler than 65, they will start to make this
[08:22.010 --> 08:26.250]  claw-like shape in the leaves and they will stop growing.
[08:26.250 --> 08:27.510]  They basically freeze.
[08:27.510 --> 08:28.510]  They chill out.
[08:28.510 --> 08:29.510]  They don't do shit.
[08:29.510 --> 08:32.770]  You don't like sticking your feet or your hands in cold water, so don't do that to your
[08:32.770 --> 08:33.770]  plants.
[08:33.770 --> 08:34.770]  That's my recommendation.
[08:34.850 --> 08:40.330]  If the water is coming out of your spigot or your spout, wherever your water is coming
[08:40.330 --> 08:46.330]  from, if the source is too warm or too cold, for example, right now in Colorado it has
[08:46.330 --> 08:47.810]  been ridiculously cold.
[08:47.810 --> 08:53.030]  It was 17 degrees the other day when I went to work at 7 in the morning.
[08:53.030 --> 08:57.890]  We filled the containers with water from the RO machine and that water was 62 degrees.
[08:57.890 --> 09:02.850]  There was no chance I was going to feed that water to the plants, so we use bucket heaters
[09:02.850 --> 09:04.050]  to heat the water.
[09:04.050 --> 09:06.150]  If it's too cold, you can use chillers.
[09:06.150 --> 09:11.290]  If you're not looking to invest money and items to keep your water at the right temperature,
[09:11.290 --> 09:13.930]  you can use the lights in your grow room.
[09:13.930 --> 09:19.670]  If you are filling your reservoir and putting your bubblers in there, you can move that
[09:19.670 --> 09:20.850]  to the grow room.
[09:20.850 --> 09:25.290]  You may deal with a little bit more humidity, but the grow lights in that grow room will
[09:25.290 --> 09:27.890]  get your water to the correct temperature.
[09:27.890 --> 09:32.330]  It may take a little while, but that will get it to the right temperature.
[09:32.330 --> 09:34.410]  This may also have the opposite effect.
[09:34.410 --> 09:38.850]  If you're running a hydro grow and you've got the hydro reservoir in the room, perhaps
[09:38.850 --> 09:43.010]  you're running a flood and drain table and the reservoir is underneath the table, maybe
[09:43.010 --> 09:46.410]  the room is heating up the water too much and that's when you're going to need a chiller.
[09:46.410 --> 09:50.250]  I actually realized that I said something wrong a couple of minutes ago.
[09:50.250 --> 09:55.810]  If your water is too cold, you need a bucket heater, and if your water is too warm, that's
[09:55.810 --> 09:56.810]  when you need a chiller.
[09:56.810 --> 09:59.890]  I realized as I was saying it that I said that backwards.
[09:59.890 --> 10:03.570]  We've covered the basics of getting your water to the appropriate temperature.
[10:03.570 --> 10:08.850]  Now it's time to talk about measuring and mixing your nutrients into your water.
[10:08.850 --> 10:13.370]  The first thing you need for this is a clean and accurate measuring device.
[10:13.370 --> 10:14.970]  Maybe you have some measuring cups.
[10:14.970 --> 10:19.010]  I like the shot glass and the beer glass looking style cups.
[10:19.010 --> 10:20.770]  They're really easy to clean.
[10:20.770 --> 10:22.410]  The downfall with them is they are glass.
[10:22.410 --> 10:26.130]  If you're clumsy like me, it may be better for you to get the plastic style.
[10:26.130 --> 10:27.370]  There are a lot of options.
[10:27.370 --> 10:32.750]  Get something with milliliters, with tablespoons and teaspoons, with ounces because each brand
[10:32.750 --> 10:34.690]  of nutrients is going to ask for different stuff.
[10:34.690 --> 10:38.010]  I like brands that go by milliliters.
[10:38.010 --> 10:42.490]  Milliliters per gallon is my favorite, but each brand does their own thing.
[10:42.490 --> 10:45.850]  You'll need a measuring cup or a measuring device.
[10:45.850 --> 10:49.770]  If you're using dry nutrients like veg bloom, you may need a scale.
[10:49.770 --> 10:58.210]  I recommend that you have a pH meter, a PPM meter, and possibly an EC meter and a thermometer.
[10:58.210 --> 11:01.530]  I can highly recommend the Bluelab Combo Meter.
[11:01.530 --> 11:03.050]  It's got all of the above on there.
[11:03.050 --> 11:08.050]  It's got the PPM, the EC, the pH, and a thermometer all in one unit.
[11:08.050 --> 11:09.170]  I really love the device.
[11:09.170 --> 11:11.310]  It's a little expensive.
[11:11.310 --> 11:16.010]  One thing that I can recommend if you, with any pH meter, keep the probe wet.
[11:16.010 --> 11:22.010]  Fill it up somehow with some pH 7 solution in there and keep that probe wet as long as
[11:22.010 --> 11:24.010]  you can because that will keep it alive.
[11:24.010 --> 11:27.050]  They say about pH probes, if it dries, it dies.
[11:27.050 --> 11:28.610]  Keep that fucker wet.
[11:28.610 --> 11:33.050]  Also, calibrate your equipment frequently, at least once a month.
[11:33.050 --> 11:36.930]  If you're working with it a lot, do it once a week, but at least once a month.
[11:36.930 --> 11:40.650]  At the big grow, if I'm working in a big grow, you guys, you know I bounce around from large
[11:40.650 --> 11:42.210]  grow to large grow.
[11:42.210 --> 11:47.290]  If it's up to me, when I'm using those pH meters, about once every two weeks, I catch
[11:47.290 --> 11:48.290]  myself.
[11:48.290 --> 11:49.290]  Just go into some solution.
[11:49.290 --> 11:51.850]  You dump the pH solution into a container.
[11:51.850 --> 11:54.770]  There's one that's four and then one that's probably seven or 10.
[11:54.770 --> 11:55.770]  Just check them and see.
[11:55.770 --> 12:00.010]  If they don't come out perfectly accurate, take a minute and fix the pH meter.
[12:00.010 --> 12:01.090]  It can't take that long.
[12:01.090 --> 12:04.530]  Maybe five, maybe 10 minutes at the absolute most if it's frustrating and giving you a
[12:04.530 --> 12:05.530]  hard time.
[12:05.530 --> 12:06.730]  It'll get quicker.
[12:06.730 --> 12:09.570]  Just adjust the calibration on your pH meter.
[12:09.570 --> 12:10.570]  That's super important.
[12:10.570 --> 12:12.050]  Sorry, I went off on a rant there.
[12:12.890 --> 12:18.690]  You're going to need a bucket or a reservoir with a clearly marked measurement area, either
[12:18.690 --> 12:24.730]  like a reservoir from the hydro shop that is already a predetermined volume, or what
[12:24.730 --> 12:31.850]  I like to use is the, I think they're 32 and 55 gallon Rubbermaid trash cans.
[12:31.850 --> 12:36.290]  By the trash can it lows, and I also get the little wheels that go underneath it so that
[12:36.290 --> 12:38.690]  you can roll that sucker around.
[12:38.690 --> 12:43.570]  Then I will get a five gallon bucket or one of those five gallon, like the deep rock water
[12:43.570 --> 12:47.290]  bottles or whatever brand water bottle, the five gallon kind that gets delivered.
[12:47.290 --> 12:52.330]  I'll go buy one of those and I will use it to measure out five gallons and I'll mark
[12:52.330 --> 12:55.050]  it on the inside and the outside of my trash can.
[12:55.050 --> 12:58.970]  And then I'll measure to 10 gallons and market on the inside and outside of my trash can.
[12:58.970 --> 13:03.970]  And then I'll do 15 and I'll do it in increments of five all the way up to 25 or 30 or 50 or
[13:03.970 --> 13:05.810]  however big my container is.
[13:05.810 --> 13:10.770]  So that way I can see five, 10, 15 or however many gallons I've got and I can be accurate.
[13:10.770 --> 13:11.770]  That's important to me.
[13:11.770 --> 13:16.690]  So you need a clean marked container that you could put water in.
[13:16.690 --> 13:18.210]  It may need to be movable.
[13:18.210 --> 13:21.130]  You may need to get it from your water to your grow.
[13:21.130 --> 13:22.490]  So think about wheels.
[13:22.490 --> 13:24.450]  Think about how you're going to carry it.
[13:24.450 --> 13:26.930]  Most of you guys are probably just going to be mixing in a five gallon bucket.
[13:26.930 --> 13:30.070]  I like the Lowe's bucket, the Home Depot bucket.
[13:30.070 --> 13:31.070]  Keep it simple.
[13:31.070 --> 13:32.070]  Keep it affordable.
[13:32.070 --> 13:36.110]  If you want to buy one of those fancy reservoirs from the grow store, go for it.
[13:36.110 --> 13:37.110]  Be my guest.
[13:37.110 --> 13:38.110]  It looks great.
[13:38.110 --> 13:41.890]  It looks great in pictures and it's already marked for the volume.
[13:41.890 --> 13:45.950]  Just keep in mind as soon as you pull up to the house and carry that thing in the house,
[13:45.950 --> 13:47.350]  everybody knows you grow weed now.
[13:47.350 --> 13:48.350]  All right.
[13:48.350 --> 13:50.310]  So you've got a chosen reservoir, a chosen container.
[13:50.310 --> 13:53.270]  One thing I should mention is that you need to clean this occasionally.
[13:53.270 --> 13:56.350]  I would clean it probably every use if you can.
[13:56.350 --> 13:59.310]  If it's a big trash can, I understand that's kind of a pain in the ass if you don't have
[13:59.310 --> 14:01.270]  a place to rinse it out and hose it out.
[14:01.470 --> 14:03.030]  Try to get to it as frequently as you can.
[14:03.030 --> 14:04.950]  You'll see some biofilm buildup on it.
[14:04.950 --> 14:05.950]  It'll get funky.
[14:05.950 --> 14:09.710]  That will start to mess with your EC, your PPM and your pH.
[14:09.710 --> 14:10.710]  Clean your shit.
[14:10.710 --> 14:13.110]  It only takes a few extra minutes to just clean stuff up.
[14:13.110 --> 14:14.110]  Take it out.
[14:14.110 --> 14:16.630]  If it's a trash can, you could probably sneak it out to the backyard and hose it out.
[14:16.630 --> 14:18.630]  People won't wonder too much what's going on.
[14:18.630 --> 14:22.150]  If you've got that reservoir from the hydro store, everyone's like, oh, he's cleaning
[14:22.150 --> 14:23.250]  his weed reservoir.
[14:23.250 --> 14:25.670]  So that's when you might want to think about what you're going to buy.
[14:25.670 --> 14:27.490]  Hosing out a five gallon bucket is really easy.
[14:27.490 --> 14:28.490]  You can do that in the bathtub.
[14:28.490 --> 14:29.790]  You can do that in the shower.
[14:30.310 --> 14:32.270]  Just think about cleaning your container.
[14:32.270 --> 14:33.270]  Do that frequently.
[14:33.270 --> 14:34.790]  Please clean everything very frequently.
[14:34.790 --> 14:37.150]  All right, so you've got a clean container.
[14:37.150 --> 14:39.150]  Now the next step is to fill it up.
[14:39.150 --> 14:41.790]  You're either using your RO water or your tap water.
[14:41.790 --> 14:42.910]  Fill your container.
[14:42.910 --> 14:46.870]  Fill it up to if you need 15 gallons, if you need 20 gallons, fill it to where you need
[14:46.870 --> 14:47.990]  it to that gallon amount.
[14:47.990 --> 14:51.270]  If you're using a five gallon bucket, fill it up to the five gallon point.
[14:51.270 --> 14:54.550]  In a five gallon bucket, there will be some extra space.
[14:54.550 --> 14:56.710]  You will not fill it all the way to the top.
[14:56.710 --> 15:00.990]  There's probably like an inch or two of extra space in there, maybe three inches of extra
[15:00.990 --> 15:02.370]  space.
[15:02.370 --> 15:03.850]  Don't fill it all the way to the top.
[15:03.850 --> 15:08.070]  If you're making a reservoir, try to have a little extra room in your reservoir as well.
[15:08.070 --> 15:11.510]  We're going to talk about why here in just a couple of seconds.
[15:11.510 --> 15:14.050]  So you fill up your container and you check the temperature.
[15:14.050 --> 15:17.590]  The first thing I would do is check the temperature.
[15:17.590 --> 15:21.630]  If the temperature is too high or too low, we're going to use the proper tool, either
[15:21.790 --> 15:27.510]  the bucket heater or maybe an aquarium heater or a chiller, or we're going to use the heat
[15:27.510 --> 15:29.950]  from the grow room or we're going to use whatever.
[15:29.950 --> 15:31.470]  However, you got to do it.
[15:31.470 --> 15:34.950]  Get that water to the appropriate temperature.
[15:34.950 --> 15:39.150]  If you're using tap water, you may have wanted to fill this up 24 to 48 hours in advance
[15:39.150 --> 15:40.870]  so that you could start bubbling it.
[15:40.870 --> 15:44.990]  And then you can also get your temperature correction device in there at that time.
[15:44.990 --> 15:48.870]  So that when it comes time to mix the nutrients, you're already at the right temperature.
[15:48.870 --> 15:52.590]  So if you're running a commercial grow, before you leave tonight, fill up your containers
[15:52.590 --> 15:56.830]  with water, put your chillers or your bucket heaters in there and let them run for a little
[15:56.830 --> 16:01.410]  while, set them on a timer maybe to click on three hours before you come in in the morning.
[16:01.410 --> 16:02.630]  That shit might start getting right.
[16:02.630 --> 16:05.030]  It'll be correct by the time you get there.
[16:05.030 --> 16:06.030]  Think ahead, you guys.
[16:06.030 --> 16:07.550]  Thinking ahead and growing is very important.
[16:07.550 --> 16:11.490]  So fill your container, get the temperature of that water correct.
[16:11.490 --> 16:13.890]  Now it's time to mix up your nutrients.
[16:13.890 --> 16:19.370]  Now it's when you need that clean mixing container, that clean measuring device.
[16:19.370 --> 16:22.810]  So when you're mixing, be accurate, you guys.
[16:22.810 --> 16:24.890]  If the bottle says, okay, this is a side rant.
[16:24.890 --> 16:30.250]  If the bottle says 50 mils per gallon, you can probably get away with 25 to 30 mils per
[16:30.250 --> 16:31.250]  gallon.
[16:31.250 --> 16:34.730]  But whatever you decide to mix, be accurate.
[16:34.730 --> 16:40.810]  If you wrote down that your mix is 30 milliliters, put 30 milliliters in that bucket.
[16:40.810 --> 16:41.930]  Don't do 29.
[16:41.930 --> 16:43.210]  Don't do 32.
[16:43.210 --> 16:46.690]  Be as accurate as you can and your plants will love you.
[16:46.690 --> 16:47.690]  You will like it.
[16:47.690 --> 16:48.770]  You'll be able to take better notes.
[16:48.770 --> 16:51.290]  You'll be able to correct things in the future if you see problems.
[16:51.290 --> 16:56.890]  So when you're mixing your nutrients, be as accurate as you possibly can.
[16:56.890 --> 17:02.610]  Also, never mix your bottle nutrients together without mixing them into a large container
[17:02.610 --> 17:03.810]  of water.
[17:03.810 --> 17:06.850]  Those nutrients are in separate bottles for a reason.
[17:06.850 --> 17:09.370]  It's not just because they want to sell you two bottles.
[17:09.370 --> 17:13.690]  There are elements in each bottle that if they were sold together would bind and it
[17:13.690 --> 17:17.570]  would deactivate basically the ingredients that are in each bottle.
[17:17.570 --> 17:18.570]  So they keep them separate.
[17:18.570 --> 17:24.410]  And when you pour bottle A into this much water, it dilutes it strong enough to where
[17:24.410 --> 17:28.730]  when you pour bottle B into that much water, they will not create a chemical bond and it
[17:28.730 --> 17:31.130]  will not disrupt your solution.
[17:31.130 --> 17:37.330]  So never mix your nutrients together without plenty of water in the container.
[17:37.330 --> 17:39.530]  Now let's move into actually doing the mix.
[17:39.530 --> 17:41.450]  The actual mix of the nutrients.
[17:41.450 --> 17:43.010]  Making the soup.
[17:43.010 --> 17:46.730]  Something I should talk about is wear gloves.
[17:46.730 --> 17:50.250]  Put on some nitrile gloves, some rubber gloves, some hand protection.
[17:50.250 --> 17:54.210]  Some of the things you're going to be touching, pH down is bad for your skin.
[17:54.210 --> 17:55.930]  My skin reacts funky to cow mag.
[17:55.930 --> 17:59.410]  From some brands of cow mag, my skin will get splotchy if I touch it.
[17:59.410 --> 18:03.250]  A lot of the things that we play with in the grow are not really good for our skin.
[18:03.250 --> 18:07.130]  So I recommend that when you walk into the grow, you're just wearing rubber gloves all
[18:07.130 --> 18:08.130]  the time.
[18:08.130 --> 18:09.130]  Have some gloves.
[18:09.130 --> 18:10.130]  The black nitriles are my favorite.
[18:10.130 --> 18:12.130]  They fit the best of the shape, the best shape.
[18:12.130 --> 18:14.610]  They don't make my hands smell super funky.
[18:14.610 --> 18:15.610]  That's what I would recommend.
[18:15.610 --> 18:16.610]  So wear gloves.
[18:16.610 --> 18:20.970]  Also, when you're mixing nutrients, you guys, wear eye protection.
[18:20.970 --> 18:21.970]  You might feel nerdy.
[18:21.970 --> 18:22.970]  Who cares?
[18:22.970 --> 18:24.650]  You're not in there to be stylish.
[18:24.650 --> 18:26.050]  Nobody's looking at you.
[18:26.050 --> 18:27.630]  Wear some sort of protective eyewear.
[18:27.630 --> 18:32.390]  If it's those goggles, the Science Lab goggles, that's probably what I would recommend because
[18:32.530 --> 18:36.390]  I've heard a story of a friend who actually listens to this podcast.
[18:36.390 --> 18:41.830]  He was mixing nutrients in his private grow and he splashed maybe one drop of pH down
[18:41.830 --> 18:47.430]  in his eye and he had to pull his phone out of his pocket and he had to use Siri to call
[18:47.430 --> 18:50.210]  911 for himself because he could not see.
[18:50.210 --> 18:54.830]  He went into full panic mode because it hurt so bad and he had to call the police and the
[18:54.830 --> 19:00.030]  paramedics to come to his grow to rescue him because he got products in his eye.
[19:00.030 --> 19:02.110]  So you guys, wear eye protection.
[19:02.110 --> 19:03.150]  You only get one set of eyes.
[19:03.150 --> 19:04.530]  You don't want to fuck them up.
[19:04.530 --> 19:08.190]  Be very careful in the grow, please, with your eyes, with your fingers, with your hands.
[19:08.190 --> 19:10.790]  We're going to talk about grow room safety in another episode.
[19:10.790 --> 19:12.110]  That's a really good idea.
[19:12.110 --> 19:17.470]  So put on some nitrile gloves, put on some eye protection, and then grab your clean and
[19:17.470 --> 19:21.950]  trusty measuring device and we're going to talk about actually mixing nutrients.
[19:21.950 --> 19:26.990]  Now I asked our Facebook friends and my Instagram friends for guidance on this and nine out
[19:26.990 --> 19:30.950]  of 10 people said mix your potassium silicates first.
[19:30.950 --> 19:35.430]  So if you're using some sort of potassium silicate product, if you're using Botanicare,
[19:35.430 --> 19:37.710]  it's just called potassium silicate.
[19:37.710 --> 19:41.230]  If you're using Osa 90, is it Osa 90 or 28?
[19:41.230 --> 19:45.330]  Whichever Osa product you're using, if you're using Osa for potassium silicates, everybody
[19:45.330 --> 19:47.830]  says to put that in first.
[19:47.830 --> 19:54.190]  So potassium silicates first, stir that for a few minutes, get it emulsified.
[19:54.190 --> 19:55.190]  That's the word I'm looking for.
[19:55.190 --> 19:57.030]  Get it fully emulsified into your water.
[19:57.030 --> 19:59.750]  If you can see it in there, you need to stir longer.
[19:59.750 --> 20:04.710]  After the potassium silicates, everybody recommends that you add CalMag.
[20:04.710 --> 20:10.130]  Add in the recommended or appropriate amount of CalMag, stir again, and then after that,
[20:10.130 --> 20:13.670]  if you're using micro, that's when you would add in your micro.
[20:13.670 --> 20:17.350]  If you're not using micro, you might want to read about it.
[20:17.350 --> 20:20.710]  Maybe your nutrient line has something else that is covering the micro.
[20:20.710 --> 20:22.510]  Check and see what you're missing.
[20:22.510 --> 20:26.150]  After that, everybody would recommend that you use your base nutrients.
[20:26.150 --> 20:30.410]  If you're using a brand that only has one bottle of base nutrients, add in your base
[20:30.410 --> 20:32.350]  nutrients at the appropriate amount.
[20:32.350 --> 20:36.370]  If you're using something like Advanced Nutrients that has an A and a B, you would definitely
[20:36.370 --> 20:41.630]  do A first, give it a little stir, then put in B and give it a little stir.
[20:41.630 --> 20:44.390]  Again, this is all about chemical bonds.
[20:44.390 --> 20:49.790]  We're doing things in this order so that things do not bond in specific ways.
[20:49.790 --> 20:54.910]  So mix in your potassium silicate, your CalMag, your micro, your base, your A and B if you
[20:54.910 --> 20:56.190]  have a two-part.
[20:56.190 --> 20:59.910]  And now is when you would add in any other additives that you've got.
[20:59.910 --> 21:05.070]  If you're adding a bloom booster, if you're adding any sweeteners or bud hardeners, those
[21:05.070 --> 21:06.710]  would all get mixed in last.
[21:06.710 --> 21:11.630]  Now, something that somebody recommended to me, and I checked on this and it makes sense,
[21:11.630 --> 21:13.390]  stir counterclockwise.
[21:13.390 --> 21:18.710]  Again, this is all about bonding of certain molecules.
[21:18.710 --> 21:22.270]  So I know it sounds crazy, you guys, but do research on that if you'd like to.
[21:22.270 --> 21:27.150]  Stirring your solution counterclockwise will have a difference in bonding of molecules
[21:27.150 --> 21:28.150]  in your solution.
[21:28.150 --> 21:30.030]  If you're interested, read about that.
[21:30.030 --> 21:31.030]  It's very interesting.
[21:31.030 --> 21:36.470]  All right, so we've got all of our products stirred into our water.
[21:36.470 --> 21:38.430]  It has all been stirred counterclockwise.
[21:38.430 --> 21:39.870]  It's all at the appropriate temperature.
[21:39.870 --> 21:42.630]  It's hanging out for a couple of seconds, getting all mixed in together.
[21:42.630 --> 21:46.090]  Now it's time to check the PPMs.
[21:46.090 --> 21:47.870]  Why do we want to check the PPMs?
[21:47.870 --> 21:52.310]  The particles per million tells us how much stuff is in our water.
[21:52.310 --> 21:55.990]  If you feed your plants too much stuff, they're going to choke.
[21:55.990 --> 21:57.350]  They're going to get nutrient lockout.
[21:57.350 --> 21:58.350]  They're going to get burnt.
[21:58.350 --> 21:59.710]  They're going to look funky.
[21:59.710 --> 22:03.470]  So we want to make sure that there's not too much stuff in there, not too many particles,
[22:03.470 --> 22:05.750]  not too many nutrients, not too many elements.
[22:05.750 --> 22:09.270]  So how many PPMs do we want to get our water to?
[22:09.270 --> 22:14.790]  That kind of depends on what phase of growth or bloom you are in.
[22:14.790 --> 22:17.390]  So seedlings and small plants don't need a lot of nutrients.
[22:17.910 --> 22:19.630]  They don't need a lot of PPMs.
[22:19.630 --> 22:26.070]  I try to start off at a lower PPM for my smaller plants, somewhere around 600 to 900 PPMs for
[22:26.070 --> 22:30.330]  the small stuff, like the small veg plants in cups and small pots.
[22:30.330 --> 22:32.750]  As they get bigger, I do increase.
[22:32.750 --> 22:37.110]  By week four, I'm usually up to about 1500 PPMs.
[22:37.110 --> 22:39.270]  In veg, I don't really go too hard with the nutrients.
[22:39.270 --> 22:42.550]  I give them base nutrients, potassium silicates, cow mag.
[22:42.550 --> 22:45.670]  I'll give them some stuff to keep them moving root wise.
[22:45.670 --> 22:48.750]  But they really don't get a whole lot of nutrients in the veg phase.
[22:48.750 --> 22:49.750]  I just want them to grow.
[22:49.750 --> 22:51.270]  I want them to get stout.
[22:51.270 --> 22:52.950]  I want them to be healthy.
[22:52.950 --> 22:57.030]  So once we start flowering, that's when I kind of start boosting it up.
[22:57.030 --> 23:03.590]  I week one of flowering, I'll probably start off right about maybe 1000 or 1300 PPMs.
[23:03.590 --> 23:09.190]  And then I will increase until I hit, honestly, I'll get close to 1900 PPMs.
[23:09.190 --> 23:13.590]  But honestly, I would not recommend if you're using bottled nutrients and you're not a very
[23:13.590 --> 23:14.970]  experienced grower.
[23:14.970 --> 23:20.250]  You probably shouldn't get over 1700 or 1800 particles per million in your solution or
[23:20.250 --> 23:22.230]  you'll start burning your plants.
[23:22.230 --> 23:25.850]  If you think you know what you're doing and you can mix and match nutrients to where you're
[23:25.850 --> 23:30.050]  not giving it too much of one thing, but you're supplementing what's missing by adding more
[23:30.050 --> 23:32.950]  PPMs, then you may be able to get away with it.
[23:32.950 --> 23:36.970]  But be very careful because once you've burnt the plants, you can't take that back.
[23:36.970 --> 23:40.010]  You can give more, but you can't take anything out.
[23:40.010 --> 23:44.130]  Honestly, most of the feed charts that come with bottled nutrients these days, most of
[23:44.130 --> 23:45.370]  them are pretty accurate.
[23:45.370 --> 23:50.210]  If you follow that feed chart, maybe reduce it, maybe use about 75% of what the bottle
[23:50.210 --> 23:51.290]  says.
[23:51.290 --> 23:52.570]  Most of the companies will make a feature.
[23:52.570 --> 23:58.170]  You can find it online, follow that and it won't get you over 1700 or 1800 PPMs and then
[23:58.170 --> 24:00.410]  see what that chart does and adjust from there.
[24:00.410 --> 24:02.390]  If you want to go a little harder, go for it.
[24:02.390 --> 24:05.110]  If you realize you need to go a little lighter, go for it.
[24:05.110 --> 24:06.170]  That's something that you could do.
[24:06.170 --> 24:08.170]  So you've got your solution mixed up.
[24:08.170 --> 24:09.410]  You're checking your PPMs.
[24:09.410 --> 24:11.690]  If you feel like it's right where you want it.
[24:11.690 --> 24:13.410]  Now you need to adjust the pH.
[24:13.410 --> 24:17.850]  If you feel like the PPMs are too high, if you feel like it's too hot for your plants,
[24:17.850 --> 24:19.790]  you can simply add water.
[24:19.790 --> 24:23.430]  If you've got everything mixed up and the PPMs are hitting more than you want for that
[24:23.430 --> 24:26.850]  week and you feel like it's too hot for the plants, add a little bit of water.
[24:26.850 --> 24:29.650]  If you're using RO water, put RO water in there.
[24:29.650 --> 24:31.910]  If you're using tap water, add more tap water.
[24:31.910 --> 24:36.170]  Get your PPM meter and put it in your solution that's mixed up and then get your regular
[24:36.170 --> 24:40.810]  water and just slowly add it and watch the numbers on your PPM meter go down.
[24:40.810 --> 24:44.650]  And then once you get it to the acceptable appropriate number, then you can stop.
[24:44.650 --> 24:46.730]  And that's when it's time to adjust your pH.
[24:46.730 --> 24:50.250]  The last thing you do is adjust your pH.
[24:50.250 --> 24:51.930]  Now you need your pH meter.
[24:51.930 --> 24:55.010]  You want to put it in the water, give it a little stir around, give it a couple seconds
[24:55.010 --> 24:57.090]  to adjust and see where you are.
[24:57.090 --> 25:00.530]  If it's up too high, you need to put some pH down in there.
[25:00.530 --> 25:04.210]  If you're too low, you need to put some pH up in there.
[25:04.210 --> 25:08.970]  A good area for your plants, for most plants to be is 6.2.
[25:08.970 --> 25:12.490]  Get your solution to 6.2 and you should be just fine.
[25:12.490 --> 25:14.330]  My smaller plants, I go a little lower.
[25:14.330 --> 25:19.970]  My larger plants may get a little higher, but 6.2 is a good general range of pH for
[25:19.970 --> 25:21.770]  most cannabis plants.
[25:21.770 --> 25:24.410]  I did a whole episode about the importance of pH.
[25:24.410 --> 25:27.690]  I recorded that episode on August 10th of 2015.
[25:27.690 --> 25:32.130]  It's actually episode number 88 and it is called The Importance of pH.
[25:32.130 --> 25:36.030]  If you want to check that out, it is still in the feed on iTunes and Stitcher and it's
[25:36.030 --> 25:39.830]  on the website, iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[25:39.830 --> 25:41.990]  There are 100 episodes available there.
[25:41.990 --> 25:44.670]  If you want to go back in history, check those out.
[25:44.670 --> 25:47.150]  Again, it's episode number 88.
[25:47.150 --> 25:49.390]  It's called The Importance of pH.
[25:49.390 --> 25:51.270]  All right, you guys.
[25:51.270 --> 25:52.590]  We've got our reservoir filled.
[25:52.590 --> 25:54.270]  We've got our nutrients mixed in there.
[25:54.270 --> 25:58.070]  We've got our PPMs adjusted to the appropriate PPMs to where it won't be too strong of a
[25:58.070 --> 25:59.910]  solution for our plants.
[25:59.910 --> 26:05.070]  We've got our pH adjusted to approximately 6.2 or whatever you're finding appropriate
[26:05.110 --> 26:07.870]  for your garden at this stage of its life.
[26:07.870 --> 26:10.550]  Now let's talk about actually physically feeding the plants.
[26:10.550 --> 26:15.330]  If you're running an auto hydro system or a soil or soilless or cocoa system that's
[26:15.330 --> 26:20.830]  on a drip system, make sure that the plants get ... that the root zone, that the soil
[26:20.830 --> 26:25.670]  gets fully saturated when you water those plants with your automation system.
[26:25.670 --> 26:29.710]  You have to figure out how long it comes on and how frequently that watering system comes
[26:29.710 --> 26:30.710]  on.
[26:30.710 --> 26:34.870]  I am going to do an entire episode about building a watering system and getting that set up
[26:34.910 --> 26:37.550]  so that will be probably two or three episodes from now.
[26:37.550 --> 26:42.390]  I may put that one out as a Thursday bonus episode.
[26:42.390 --> 26:47.230]  If you're running an automated system, mainly focus on getting everything saturated, let
[26:47.230 --> 26:50.530]  it dry kind of, and then saturate it again.
[26:50.530 --> 26:52.110]  You need a timer.
[26:52.110 --> 26:55.510]  You'll have to run the timer and see how long it takes to saturate the plants and then you'll
[26:55.510 --> 26:58.750]  have to pay attention to how long it takes them to dry and then you'll have to make that
[26:58.750 --> 27:00.230]  timer run again.
[27:00.230 --> 27:03.210]  It's duration and interval is what you're going to have to figure out.
[27:03.210 --> 27:04.210]  It's not too hard.
[27:04.210 --> 27:05.850]  It just takes a day to do it.
[27:05.850 --> 27:08.610]  That's pretty much how you're going to have to set up any drip system with any sort of
[27:08.610 --> 27:12.910]  hydro or cocoa or soilless mix.
[27:12.910 --> 27:16.130]  Just make sure that if you're using cubes or whatever you're using, make sure that they
[27:16.130 --> 27:20.270]  get fully saturated and that they've got the appropriate dry time and then just repeat
[27:20.270 --> 27:21.810]  that cycle over and over.
[27:21.810 --> 27:26.010]  As the plants get larger and further into the flower phase, you may have to increase
[27:26.010 --> 27:31.650]  either the duration of watering or the less interval between waterings is something you'll
[27:31.650 --> 27:32.650]  have to think about.
[27:32.650 --> 27:35.410]  You'll see that happening as it grows and we're going to talk more about that in that
[27:35.410 --> 27:37.770]  auto watering episode that's coming up.
[27:37.770 --> 27:44.930]  Let's talk about watering your soil or cocoa or soilless mix plants that are in pots.
[27:44.930 --> 27:47.330]  Maybe you're watering with a pitcher.
[27:47.330 --> 27:49.490]  Maybe you're going to the reservoir and just getting a pitcher.
[27:49.490 --> 27:52.570]  I use in my personal grow, I use a Kool-Aid pitcher.
[27:52.570 --> 27:54.530]  I use a one gallon plastic pitcher.
[27:54.530 --> 27:57.450]  I use two of them so that I could scoop water with both hands.
[27:57.450 --> 28:02.050]  My plants are in seven gallon pots so they're not too low.
[28:02.050 --> 28:05.050]  I can reach them just by doing a short bend.
[28:05.050 --> 28:07.530]  I can walk down the middle of the row and water two plants at a time.
[28:07.530 --> 28:11.330]  I scoop water out of the res, turn a little bit, water two plants.
[28:11.330 --> 28:13.410]  I use the Kool-Aid pitcher.
[28:13.410 --> 28:15.370]  At the commercial grow, I use a water wand.
[28:15.370 --> 28:19.210]  I put a pump in a trash can, which is the reservoir.
[28:19.210 --> 28:20.650]  The trash can's on wheels.
[28:20.650 --> 28:21.650]  I put a pump.
[28:21.650 --> 28:23.930]  It's like a sump pump that plugs into the wall.
[28:23.930 --> 28:26.610]  That runs to a hose, which runs to a water wand.
[28:26.610 --> 28:29.610]  That water wand, I basically squeeze a trigger and the water comes out.
[28:29.610 --> 28:33.770]  It's got about a two foot attachment extension on it so that I can get to the plants that
[28:33.770 --> 28:34.930]  are at the end of the rows.
[28:34.930 --> 28:36.930]  That's why I like the water wand for the commercial grow.
[28:36.930 --> 28:40.450]  I either use the pitcher or a water wand.
[28:40.450 --> 28:42.090]  However you want to do it is find the water wand.
[28:42.090 --> 28:44.290]  You tend to make a little bit of a mess.
[28:44.290 --> 28:46.690]  With the pitcher, you can put the water where you want it.
[28:46.690 --> 28:52.010]  I feel like the pitcher is more time efficient because I can grab water and pour it, grab
[28:52.010 --> 28:53.290]  water and pour it.
[28:53.290 --> 28:54.690]  There's no time for it to come out.
[28:54.690 --> 28:55.850]  It just pours out of the pitcher.
[28:55.850 --> 29:01.330]  With the water wand, with the five gallon pot at the commercial grow, I count to 70
[29:01.330 --> 29:02.330]  as I water.
[29:02.330 --> 29:05.330]  I count one, two, three, four, five.
[29:05.330 --> 29:09.850]  It takes me to 70 to water a five gallon pot appropriately.
[29:09.850 --> 29:12.370]  That's probably 50 seconds of me counting to 70.
[29:12.370 --> 29:14.930]  That's how fast I just probably over count time.
[29:14.930 --> 29:15.930]  That's a lot of time.
[29:15.930 --> 29:17.730]  I prefer the pitcher method.
[29:17.730 --> 29:20.090]  Any way you do it, soak the plant.
[29:20.090 --> 29:23.930]  When you're watering the plants, make sure you fully saturate that root zone.
[29:23.930 --> 29:26.570]  All that soil needs to get wet.
[29:26.570 --> 29:28.050]  You want to see some runoff.
[29:28.050 --> 29:29.770]  You want at least a little bit of runoff.
[29:29.770 --> 29:33.290]  If you've got catch trays underneath your plants, if they're in the table, you want
[29:33.290 --> 29:35.850]  to see runoff from every single plant.
[29:35.850 --> 29:39.730]  I like to know that every inch of soil inside that pot got saturated with nutrients and
[29:39.730 --> 29:43.810]  water so that when those roots, when it does start to dry out and those roots go growing
[29:43.810 --> 29:46.690]  in there, they find those nutrients in that soil.
[29:46.690 --> 29:49.670]  It's like, hey, there's some more stuff for me to eat.
[29:49.670 --> 29:52.970]  It's really good to saturate the whole thing, I think.
[29:53.010 --> 29:57.650]  Make sure you saturate your entire root ball, get a little bit of runoff, and then let them
[29:57.650 --> 29:59.890]  start to dry out over the next few days.
[29:59.890 --> 30:03.250]  I don't water until they get kind of dry.
[30:03.250 --> 30:05.370]  I like to pick them up and see how light they are.
[30:05.370 --> 30:07.930]  Once they start getting light, that's when they need water.
[30:07.930 --> 30:08.930]  You'll know the difference.
[30:08.930 --> 30:11.090]  You'll start learning the difference.
[30:11.090 --> 30:15.410]  I also like to watch for when the leaves start to droop just a little bit.
[30:15.410 --> 30:19.290]  Normally, if you're doing it right, your leaves are facing up just a little bit.
[30:19.290 --> 30:20.290]  They're praying.
[30:20.290 --> 30:22.330]  If you're doing a good job, the leaves are horizontal.
[30:22.690 --> 30:26.730]  When they start getting thirsty, they'll start to curl down and hang and droop just a little
[30:26.730 --> 30:27.730]  bit.
[30:27.730 --> 30:30.890]  As soon as you see that droop is when those plants want water.
[30:30.890 --> 30:33.810]  That is the most ideal time to water those plants.
[30:33.810 --> 30:38.650]  If you can figure out that timing from when you water them to when that droop barely starts
[30:38.650 --> 30:44.210]  and water them right then, every time, your plants will be as happy as they can be.
[30:44.210 --> 30:47.770]  Try to find that timing, that sweet spot of right before they droop and when they get
[30:47.770 --> 30:50.410]  super light and then water them right then.
[30:50.410 --> 30:52.930]  It will get easier the more you go.
[30:52.930 --> 30:56.690]  The more you grow, the less these things will seem like a challenge to you.
[30:56.690 --> 30:59.170]  You'll walk in the grow room and you'll be able to see, you'll go, oh, I can tell by
[30:59.170 --> 31:02.450]  looking at the top of the soil that that plant needs water.
[31:02.450 --> 31:03.450]  You'll get good at it.
[31:03.450 --> 31:04.450]  Don't worry.
[31:04.450 --> 31:05.450]  Just keep practicing.
[31:05.450 --> 31:06.450]  Soak the entire plant.
[31:06.450 --> 31:07.530]  Give it some time to dry.
[31:07.530 --> 31:09.930]  Then re-soak it.
[31:09.930 --> 31:12.690]  Watch the leaves for indicators of issues.
[31:12.690 --> 31:16.010]  If your leaves start doing funny shit, that tells you that there's something wrong with
[31:16.010 --> 31:17.370]  the feeding.
[31:17.370 --> 31:19.650]  Your leaves are going to tell you if the plants were over watered.
[31:19.650 --> 31:23.290]  If the plants are over watered, they're going to start making a claw.
[31:23.290 --> 31:26.650]  If it's over watered or too cold, it will look very similar.
[31:26.650 --> 31:30.550]  The leaves will still be horizontal and they won't droop, but they will claw up.
[31:30.550 --> 31:34.010]  It will start to look like, just hold your hand out straight and then make a claw like
[31:34.010 --> 31:35.850]  you're a monster, that claw shape.
[31:35.850 --> 31:39.070]  That's what your leaves will start doing if they are over watered.
[31:39.070 --> 31:41.410]  If they are under watered, they'll just start drooping.
[31:41.410 --> 31:43.750]  They'll just go limp and start hanging down.
[31:43.750 --> 31:47.730]  If they get severely under watered, the tops of your plants will just start drooping over
[31:47.730 --> 31:48.970]  and they'll look dead.
[31:48.970 --> 31:49.970]  You'll be able to see it.
[31:49.970 --> 31:50.970]  It's sad.
[31:50.970 --> 31:52.130]  You'll be scared as shit.
[31:52.130 --> 31:56.930]  If your plants do get to that sort of a dryness, I recommend that you don't water them with
[31:56.930 --> 31:58.930]  full strength nutrients right away.
[31:58.930 --> 32:03.330]  I would water them with light nutrients just to get them alive and back to life and woken
[32:03.330 --> 32:06.930]  up and then feed them with nutrients later on.
[32:06.930 --> 32:11.010]  Because the way I see it is I don't want to get woken up to a big gigantic meal.
[32:11.010 --> 32:14.650]  I don't want to eat spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread first thing in the morning.
[32:14.650 --> 32:18.730]  I'd rather have maybe some oatmeal and some OJ to get myself started, maybe some fruit.
[32:19.170 --> 32:20.810]  I feel plants are the same way.
[32:20.810 --> 32:23.550]  When they're that droopy, you just want to hydrate them and get them moving.
[32:23.550 --> 32:26.050]  You don't want to clog them up with more food.
[32:26.050 --> 32:27.050]  I don't know.
[32:27.050 --> 32:29.810]  Maybe some of you guys want to wake up and eat a steak right away, but that is not how
[32:29.810 --> 32:30.810]  I'm going to roll.
[32:30.810 --> 32:33.850]  Okay, so underwater, we talked about that burn.
[32:33.850 --> 32:37.730]  If the plants start looking like they are getting crispy or if they're getting funky
[32:37.730 --> 32:41.750]  on the edges or if they have rust looking spots on them, you may be giving them too
[32:41.750 --> 32:43.250]  much nutrients.
[32:43.250 --> 32:46.970]  If the edges of your leaves are starting to get crispy and over sharp, you may be using
[32:46.970 --> 32:48.130]  too much cow mag.
[32:49.250 --> 32:50.850]  Pay attention to the leaves.
[32:50.850 --> 32:55.330]  If you need to reduce your nutrients, you can do that, but that burn is probably not
[32:55.330 --> 32:56.770]  going to go away.
[32:56.770 --> 33:00.170]  Keep an eye on the new growth and make sure that you're not burning the new growth.
[33:00.170 --> 33:02.170]  It is okay if leaves get funky.
[33:02.170 --> 33:04.970]  It is okay to go ahead and remove a leaf.
[33:04.970 --> 33:05.970]  Don't be worried.
[33:05.970 --> 33:08.730]  Just cut it right off or pull it off with your fingers.
[33:08.730 --> 33:11.250]  There are probably more leaves coming to back that one up.
[33:11.250 --> 33:14.410]  One thing I've noticed is when you take off leaves, the plants will just replace it if
[33:14.410 --> 33:15.570]  it needs it.
[33:15.730 --> 33:19.210]  Also, the leaves are going to tell you if you have any sort of deficiency.
[33:19.210 --> 33:23.350]  If your leaves start getting pale yellow, if the plants are going slow and not growing
[33:23.350 --> 33:27.570]  fast enough, you probably are missing some nutrients and you could probably increase
[33:27.570 --> 33:28.890]  your PPMs.
[33:28.890 --> 33:31.250]  Also, that could be a pH issue.
[33:31.250 --> 33:34.050]  You could have a lot of problems if you're showing deficiencies.
[33:34.050 --> 33:36.970]  Quite often pH issues disguise themselves as deficiencies.
[33:36.970 --> 33:40.010]  I talk a lot about that in episode 88.
[33:40.010 --> 33:42.810]  Pay a lot of attention to the leaves, you guys.
[33:42.810 --> 33:46.370]  Paying attention to the leaves will really help, but also keep notes.
[33:46.370 --> 33:52.330]  If you keep notes of what you mixed into the solution and what you fed, try to write down
[33:52.330 --> 33:53.330]  what you mixed.
[33:53.330 --> 33:57.210]  Try to write down the pH and try to write down the PPMs of every feeding.
[33:57.210 --> 34:01.370]  Write down the date and time and also take notes of anything you saw in the grow room
[34:01.370 --> 34:05.570]  that day so that you can look back and you can have a chart and some history.
[34:05.570 --> 34:10.290]  You can say, oh look, on this day, my pH was a little high and now this plant is acting
[34:10.290 --> 34:14.130]  funky and now I know that I need to make the pH lower.
[34:14.130 --> 34:19.210]  That's how I've learned that OG Kush plants, the cushier the plant, the more cow maggot
[34:19.210 --> 34:20.210]  wants.
[34:20.210 --> 34:23.050]  Just stuff like golden goat is always macro deficient.
[34:23.050 --> 34:27.530]  There's just stuff like that that you learn and you can really boost up the macro nutrients
[34:27.530 --> 34:28.530]  with golden goat.
[34:28.530 --> 34:32.850]  It's just stuff you learn from growing specific plants over and over again.
[34:32.850 --> 34:33.930]  Learn from each watering.
[34:33.930 --> 34:35.610]  Learn from your notes.
[34:35.610 --> 34:37.170]  I think that will be beneficial.
[34:37.170 --> 34:38.170]  Take a lot of notes, you guys.
[34:38.170 --> 34:39.170]  Take a lot of notes.
[34:39.170 --> 34:42.730]  That is definitely a huge part of what makes me a better grower.
[34:42.730 --> 34:47.290]  All right, I feel like I have covered the basics and maybe a little bit of more than
[34:47.290 --> 34:53.170]  the basics of mixing your nutrients and properly watering your plants to properly saturate
[34:53.170 --> 34:55.770]  the soil and give them some time to dry out.
[34:55.770 --> 35:00.130]  Now I posted to Facebook that I was seeking help and guidance for this episode because
[35:00.130 --> 35:02.090]  I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything.
[35:02.090 --> 35:06.970]  When I posted to Instagram, I got a couple of replies that I felt I wanted to share with
[35:06.970 --> 35:07.970]  you.
[35:08.770 --> 35:10.250]  The first one comes from Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[35:10.250 --> 35:14.470]  The question that I posted to Instagram basically said, hey, I'm writing a podcast about growing
[35:14.470 --> 35:15.570]  with bottled nutrients.
[35:15.570 --> 35:17.330]  Does anybody have any guidance?
[35:17.330 --> 35:21.930]  The folks at Dragonfly Earth Medicine said, more importantly, what bottled nutrients?
[35:21.930 --> 35:26.770]  Make sure you read ingredients and make sure it is healthy for mind, body, and soil.
[35:26.770 --> 35:31.410]  Let's also remember there are only six companies that sell synthetics and all fertilizer companies
[35:31.410 --> 35:32.890]  are from those six companies.
[35:32.890 --> 35:36.890]  Then they also say that brewing is only expanding your microbiology.
[35:36.890 --> 35:39.210]  If you're brewing synthetics, you're wasting your time.
[35:39.210 --> 35:41.730]  It is counterintuitive to brew synthetics.
[35:41.730 --> 35:46.610]  It is like treating your body herbally and doing a round of antibiotics at the end.
[35:46.610 --> 35:51.610]  The important part here was that we need to pay a little bit of attention to where our
[35:51.610 --> 35:56.490]  products are coming from and what we're putting into the products that we are calling medicine.
[35:56.490 --> 36:01.090]  Pay attention, make sure that what you're using is healthy for your mind, body, and
[36:01.090 --> 36:02.090]  your soil.
[36:02.090 --> 36:04.590]  I also got another message on Instagram.
[36:04.590 --> 36:11.390]  This one says, if you add a form of high quality fulvic acid to your guys water before anything
[36:11.390 --> 36:16.990]  else, it helps buffer pH of your solution and provide a natural form of chelation without
[36:16.990 --> 36:21.190]  adding any NPK or PPMs to your water.
[36:21.190 --> 36:25.790]  It works in any type of setup, super cost efficient, and it helps your plants to naturally
[36:25.790 --> 36:30.550]  and easily uptake the nutrients and minerals you give them, especially the hard ones such
[36:30.550 --> 36:32.430]  as iron.
[36:32.430 --> 36:37.190]  This guy recommends that we add a form of high quality fulvic acid and he recommends
[36:37.190 --> 36:42.390]  Full Power or Shilajit as the brand he uses.
[36:42.390 --> 36:48.030]  He says to add that before adding anything else and it will help buffer your pH and it
[36:48.030 --> 36:50.710]  will help your plants uptake your nutrients better.
[36:50.710 --> 36:51.710]  That's always helpful.
[36:51.710 --> 36:53.230]  Then here's the part that really got my attention.
[36:53.230 --> 36:57.670]  He said also, we should completely move away from harmful and non-regenerative farming
[36:57.670 --> 37:02.270]  practices such as synthetic fertilizer programs that aren't sustainable and do more harm
[37:02.310 --> 37:07.310]  than good to our gardens, planet, and its limited natural life sustaining resources
[37:07.310 --> 37:10.710]  of life such as water, land, and clean air.
[37:10.710 --> 37:13.710]  He goes on to say there's nothing wrong with using bottled nutrients or other forms of
[37:13.710 --> 37:17.870]  farming but we must still be aware of the effects we have on our planet and fellow man
[37:17.870 --> 37:20.310]  through our action or worse yet inaction.
[37:20.310 --> 37:26.550]  He said I figured I'd touch on that last part, my shameless alternative techniques promoting.
[37:26.550 --> 37:29.910]  That came from a guy who calls himself LOS Gardens on Instagram.
[37:29.910 --> 37:31.710]  LOS underscore gardens.
[37:31.710 --> 37:35.550]  I appreciate it because we all need to be reminded occasionally to pay attention to
[37:35.550 --> 37:39.870]  where our products are coming from and what we're putting into ourselves and our gardens.
[37:39.870 --> 37:44.510]  I appreciate the insight and I appreciate the help and advice.
[37:44.510 --> 37:47.670]  You guys I understand that not everybody is able to grow organically.
[37:47.670 --> 37:50.030]  Not everybody lives in a farm area.
[37:50.030 --> 37:52.230]  I understand that a lot of us live in cities.
[37:52.230 --> 37:54.150]  A lot of us have our neighbors right next door.
[37:54.150 --> 37:57.530]  I can almost reach out one of my windows and touch my neighbor's house is how close we
[37:57.530 --> 37:58.530]  are.
[37:58.530 --> 38:02.450]  I completely understand that we don't all have space to do organic farming practices.
[38:02.450 --> 38:06.370]  I understand that we can all conceal the odors and the extra ingredients and the extra steps.
[38:06.370 --> 38:09.030]  I understand that I'm not judging you.
[38:09.030 --> 38:11.250]  If you need to use bottled nutrients, let's do it.
[38:11.250 --> 38:13.010]  I use bottled nutrients myself.
[38:13.010 --> 38:14.650]  Let's just think a little bit while we're doing it.
[38:14.650 --> 38:18.570]  Let's not try to support companies that don't support us and companies that don't support
[38:18.570 --> 38:19.690]  the environment.
[38:19.690 --> 38:21.170]  You get to choose where your money goes.
[38:21.170 --> 38:22.170]  So choose wisely.
[38:22.170 --> 38:27.450]  I want to thank everybody who commented and replied on my Facebook and Instagram post
[38:27.450 --> 38:28.890]  that helped me put this episode together.
[38:28.890 --> 38:30.410]  I truly do appreciate it.
[38:30.410 --> 38:34.810]  I also want to thank everybody that listened to the bonus episode that I put out Thursday.
[38:34.810 --> 38:39.170]  You guys, if you did not listen to the episode that I put out Thursday about seasonal affective
[38:39.170 --> 38:43.170]  disorder, you may want to go give that a listen, especially if you live in one of the colder
[38:43.170 --> 38:46.810]  winter climates where we're freezing our asses off for the past few weeks.
[38:46.810 --> 38:49.530]  It may be a good episode for you to listen to.
[38:49.530 --> 38:55.450]  Also, I have found two solutions for the folks that have been asking for old podcast episodes.
[38:55.450 --> 38:58.970]  I have got a short-term solution and a long-term solution.
[38:58.970 --> 38:59.970]  They are underway.
[38:59.970 --> 39:03.330]  I am not going to tell you what I'm going to do because they are not there yet.
[39:03.330 --> 39:05.530]  Once they are out, I will tell you all about it.
[39:05.530 --> 39:07.770]  You guys will be able to give it a listen.
[39:07.770 --> 39:12.130]  I truly appreciate how interested everybody is in hearing the old episodes.
[39:12.130 --> 39:13.610]  They really lit a fire under my ass.
[39:13.610 --> 39:15.730]  I will get those episodes out to you.
[39:15.730 --> 39:17.450]  The first 22 are ready.
[39:17.450 --> 39:18.450]  I'm working on...
[39:18.450 --> 39:20.290]  There are 179 episodes, you guys.
[39:20.290 --> 39:24.490]  It's going to take me a minute to catch up, but I will get every episode listenable very
[39:24.530 --> 39:25.530]  soon.
[39:25.530 --> 39:26.530]  22 are ready.
[39:26.530 --> 39:29.650]  I will make an announcement where they are very soon.
[39:29.650 --> 39:33.210]  If you're proactive, you may be able to go find them on your own.
[39:33.210 --> 39:34.450]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[39:34.450 --> 39:35.890]  It's been 179 episodes.
[39:35.890 --> 39:39.410]  I truly appreciate everybody for following me this far.
[39:39.410 --> 39:41.850]  I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[39:41.850 --> 39:46.010]  Once again, if you need some shirts or hoodies or stickers or hat pins made, I fully endorse
[39:46.010 --> 39:48.030]  and recommend my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[39:48.030 --> 39:50.650]  Check them out, handmadeapparel.biz.
[39:50.650 --> 39:52.610]  I would love it if you guys follow me on the social media.
[39:52.610 --> 39:55.450]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[39:55.450 --> 39:57.830]  On Facebook, it's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[39:57.830 --> 40:00.650]  If you want to say something and you're not into the social media, you can send me an
[40:00.650 --> 40:01.650]  email.
[40:01.650 --> 40:02.650]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[40:02.650 --> 40:05.650]  I talked at the start of the show about Patreon.
[40:05.650 --> 40:07.930]  I would love it if you could support me on Patreon.
[40:07.930 --> 40:10.130]  If you cannot contribute to Patreon, I still love you.
[40:10.130 --> 40:12.210]  I still want you to listen to the podcast.
[40:12.210 --> 40:14.770]  Those of you that can help out, I truly do appreciate it.
[40:14.770 --> 40:18.530]  If you can't contribute to Patreon and you want to help me out, it'd be great if you
[40:18.530 --> 40:19.570]  go to iTunes.
[40:19.570 --> 40:20.570]  Find the iTunes store.
[40:20.570 --> 40:22.290]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[40:22.290 --> 40:24.050]  Find the ratings and review section.
[40:24.050 --> 40:25.050]  Type in a comment.
[40:25.050 --> 40:26.290]  Let me know what you think about the show.
[40:26.290 --> 40:29.290]  I will read your review on a future episode.
[40:29.290 --> 40:32.190]  So far, you guys, everybody has given me a five-star rating.
[40:32.190 --> 40:36.010]  Type in, punch in as many stars as you feel I deserve, and I will appreciate it.
[40:36.010 --> 40:37.810]  You guys, I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[40:37.810 --> 40:40.130]  I want to thank you for joining me for 179 episodes.
[40:40.130 --> 40:43.850]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[40:43.850 --> 40:47.210]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
