[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Hey everyone, this is Dab and Branny and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Before you going back.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Hit it.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.000]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado,
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:02.000 --> 01:21.160]  Back Cannabis Community, it's time for episode number 158 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.160]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.160 --> 01:30.160]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.160 --> 01:35.160]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:35.160 --> 01:38.160]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:38.160 --> 01:40.160]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:40.160 --> 01:42.160]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.160]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.160]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me once again is our buddy White Mike.
[01:56.160 --> 01:57.160]  How are you doing today, bro?
[01:57.160 --> 01:58.160]  Doing good, man. How are you?
[01:58.160 --> 02:01.160]  I'm good, bro. I'm glad you recovered from that dab. You're not quite so purple anymore.
[02:01.160 --> 02:04.160]  Yeah, I caught my breath. Doing good.
[02:05.160 --> 02:11.160]  Shout out to our friends at TR Concentrate, smoking on some Star Dog Shatter.
[02:11.160 --> 02:14.160]  What's the dab that you just gave me a dab of? The Candy Kush?
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.160]  The Botanico's Live Resin Candy Kush.
[02:16.160 --> 02:18.160]  That was pretty tasty. Shout out to those guys as well.
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.160]  Absolutely delicious. Botanico does a hell of a job.
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.160]  I'm about 200 milligrams deep on some edibles right now. We've been taking plenty of dabs.
[02:27.160 --> 02:30.160]  We're going to bring you an amazing podcast. I promise you.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.160]  In this episode, we're going to talk about an email that I was sent.
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.160]  A friend of ours in, I think he's in Michigan. We'll verify that in the email.
[02:36.160 --> 02:42.160]  He is awaiting and anticipating the legalization of cannabis in his area.
[02:42.160 --> 02:47.160]  He wants to be properly prepared and he wants to know how to get a jump on things basically.
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.160]  He's got a legislation question lined up for Mike and then he's got a grow question lined up for me.
[02:52.160 --> 02:54.160]  That'll probably take up most of the episode.
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.160]  I'm also going to read a Facebook post from somebody in the cannabis community.
[02:58.160 --> 03:03.160]  I also hope to get to an email. We'll start with that one because it'll be quick.
[03:03.160 --> 03:06.160]  I hope to get to an email, a message that we received from Instagram.
[03:06.160 --> 03:08.160]  We'll probably start with that.
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.160]  Before we get that far, hey Mike, let everybody on that's listening,
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.160]  let everybody know how they can stalk you on social media so that they can check you out while they're listening to your handsome voice.
[03:17.160 --> 03:25.160]  You can find me on Twitter at Nemopunk15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[03:25.160 --> 03:28.160]  Make sure you support Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.160]  You guys, he posts a lot of great stuff there.
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.160]  Give us a like. If you see something you like, give us a share. We'd appreciate it.
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.160]  Help us build the cannabis army.
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.160]  All right, dude, thanks for coming.
[03:38.160 --> 03:46.160]  Yeah, man. I got pumped when you said you had an email that specifically requested you and me to answer some stuff.
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.160]  This is going to be an awesome question for anybody who's moving forward with their marijuana laws.
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.160]  They called you White Mike specifically, so I knew I needed you for this.
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.160]  Yep. No, it's a good question, you guys. You're going to want to listen to this, especially if you're in Michigan,
[03:59.160 --> 04:03.160]  but also if your state's just looking to go medical or even recreational.
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.160]  Yes, everywhere that is getting ready or has not yet, this could be informative for you.
[04:08.160 --> 04:11.160]  There's a lot of listeners, I'm betting, that could use the information we're about to cover today.
[04:11.160 --> 04:16.160]  Yeah. All right, before we get there, I want to talk about the breeding project that I keep telling everybody about.
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.160]  I've got an Arise mail, if you haven't been updated yet, if you don't listen to the show regularly.
[04:21.160 --> 04:24.160]  I am breeding. I'm iRegionetics.
[04:24.160 --> 04:25.160]  He's breeding cannabis plants.
[04:25.160 --> 04:27.160]  Yes, I'm breeding cannabis plants. Sorry.
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.160]  We should be specific here.
[04:28.160 --> 04:29.160]  They're not goats or children.
[04:29.160 --> 04:31.160]  If you haven't been listening, let's catch you all the way up.
[04:31.160 --> 04:34.160]  I'm not breeding piranha. I'm breeding cannabis plants.
[04:34.160 --> 04:40.160]  I made the Arise. Arise is a strain that I made. It recently tested at 31% THCA.
[04:40.160 --> 04:46.160]  It is a cross of Golden Goat and Daybreaker. It is a regular seed. It is not feminized.
[04:46.160 --> 04:53.160]  I just tested 31% THC. I searched through about 100 seeds, maybe more than 100, to find the male plant that I want.
[04:53.160 --> 05:01.160]  I've got a really killer male. I've also got a few phenotypes of females of the same strain.
[05:01.160 --> 05:03.160]  Those are all in a room together.
[05:03.160 --> 05:07.160]  The male has been removed. His pollen did its thing. The male has been pulled out of there.
[05:07.160 --> 05:09.160]  There's also a Lemon Skunk plant in there.
[05:09.160 --> 05:12.160]  There's a Golden Goat plant in there for experimental reasons.
[05:13.160 --> 05:18.160]  There's also a Grateful Dog plant in there because I wanted to make the Arise cross to Grateful Dog.
[05:18.160 --> 05:21.160]  Those are my two flagship that I'm known for right now.
[05:21.160 --> 05:22.160]  Two of my favorite.
[05:22.160 --> 05:25.160]  Yes. Two of a lot of people's favorites. I put them together. We'll see what happens to that.
[05:25.160 --> 05:29.160]  There will not be any retail Grateful Dog to Arise seeds for a long time.
[05:29.160 --> 05:31.160]  I made a very small batch. I'm going to grow them all myself.
[05:31.160 --> 05:33.160]  This is the beginning of the project, folks.
[05:33.160 --> 05:35.160]  Yes. The Arise, however, I just made F2.
[05:35.160 --> 05:38.160]  The Arise male hit the Arise females, and I made F2.
[05:38.160 --> 05:46.160]  By hitting multiple phenotypes of the females, I have made a nice option for selection for variation for my F3s.
[05:46.160 --> 05:51.160]  I'll get to see what that plant expresses in a lot of different ways.
[05:51.160 --> 05:57.160]  I'll be able to pick a very good male and a very good female to make the F3.
[05:57.160 --> 06:00.160]  Actually, my goal is to take this to F5. I'm trying not to rush it.
[06:00.160 --> 06:02.160]  I want to go through and find the exact plants I need.
[06:02.160 --> 06:07.160]  The more time and the more plants is the better is the rule of thumb in these projects.
[06:07.160 --> 06:08.160]  Yes.
[06:08.160 --> 06:11.160]  You know my encouragement is to go slow and as big as possible.
[06:11.160 --> 06:13.160]  Selection is key when it comes to this.
[06:13.160 --> 06:14.160]  Yep.
[06:14.160 --> 06:24.160]  I believe that if I hit multiple females with one male, and then I pull seeds and I keep them separate, and then I find that golden male, I don't have to use…
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.160]  Say I've got the females are labeled.
[06:26.160 --> 06:29.160]  Actually, what they actually are is there's number four.
[06:29.160 --> 06:36.160]  Okay, the keepers, the ones that are going to survive to another run are four, eight, and one that was lettered E from a previous run.
[06:36.160 --> 06:39.160]  Those are the three that are amazing phenotypes of a rise.
[06:39.160 --> 06:41.160]  Okay, so those are your ladies?
[06:41.160 --> 06:43.160]  Yeah, those will stick around for a while.
[06:43.160 --> 06:45.160]  Those are the I3, the I-R-E-3.
[06:45.160 --> 06:47.160]  Those will stick around for a little bit.
[06:47.160 --> 06:48.160]  The male I call him Solomon.
[06:48.160 --> 06:49.160]  It's a rise.
[06:49.160 --> 06:50.160]  He's a male.
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.160]  His name is Solomon.
[06:51.160 --> 06:55.160]  I feel that I'll see diversity.
[06:55.160 --> 07:04.160]  I may pick a male from number three or E, and then I may pick a female from number four, and I may breed that way,
[07:04.160 --> 07:11.160]  which it's still the same finial generation and it's still the same genetics, so I'm still making F3s, but it'll show a lot of variation and a lot of phenotypical expression.
[07:11.160 --> 07:16.160]  In the next run, you're going to have a lot more options than you would have otherwise because you're going as big as you are right now.
[07:16.160 --> 07:21.160]  I'm trying to narrow it down to where it almost looks like clones when you grow these seeds.
[07:21.160 --> 07:26.160]  By the time I get to F5, I want to be able to say, yeah, it's going to look like this, and it's basically a clone.
[07:26.160 --> 07:27.160]  That's my goal.
[07:27.160 --> 07:29.160]  That's where I'm taking that.
[07:30.160 --> 07:39.160]  If you're not quite as nerdy as we are, the long and the short of what we're getting at here, the goal of all of this is to find the best of the best of the best.
[07:39.160 --> 07:40.160]  Yes.
[07:40.160 --> 07:47.160]  Basically, what that takes is a lot of trial and error and a lot of willingness to kill off plants.
[07:48.160 --> 08:00.160]  Towards the end or at the end, the goal is you'll be able to put a 10-pack of seeds in the ground and have all of them come up very, very, very similar, very stable.
[08:02.160 --> 08:05.160]  That's what you're looking for for a market-ready product.
[08:05.160 --> 08:08.160]  That's not often what you get when you're buying seeds.
[08:08.160 --> 08:09.160]  A lot of what's available-
[08:09.160 --> 08:10.160]  Is that fair?
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.160]  I'll say that that's fair.
[08:11.160 --> 08:22.160]  A lot of what is available and even a lot of what I am making and what is available for myself are F1s, which means that they have not been F2ed, which means they have not been stabilized.
[08:22.160 --> 08:23.160]  They haven't even gotten this far.
[08:23.160 --> 08:28.160]  I took a male of one strain and a female of another, and I put pollen on it, and it made seeds.
[08:28.160 --> 08:30.160]  I tested them plenty before they were released.
[08:30.160 --> 08:34.160]  There are a lot of seed companies that do that, but that's what a lot of my stuff is.
[08:34.160 --> 08:35.160]  Guys like DJ Short-
[08:35.160 --> 08:37.160]  That's the market standard right there, basically.
[08:37.160 --> 08:39.160]  Yeah, that's how Gage Green Genetics does it.
[08:39.160 --> 08:40.160]  That's sort of how Sunco does it.
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.160]  I shake my head at a 10-pack that's one of each strain, and it's like, boy.
[08:46.160 --> 08:48.160]  Oh, like how Greenhouse will sell you-
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.160]  I've seen it from a number of the major companies where you'll get it in one form or another.
[08:53.160 --> 08:55.160]  I've seen it as 10 little plastic baggies stapled together.
[08:55.160 --> 08:59.160]  Right. Here's one OG Kush. Here's one Sauer Diesel. Here's one Northern Lights.
[08:59.160 --> 09:00.160]  Yeah.
[09:00.160 --> 09:01.160]  You're like, I get one seed of that?
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.160]  I mean, just trial and error with germination alone makes that silly.
[09:06.160 --> 09:07.160]  Yeah.
[09:07.160 --> 09:13.160]  But when you know as much as we do about phenotypical expression and plant stabilization,
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.160]  and that this is likely an F1, or maybe if I'm lucky an F2, God only knows what I'm getting.
[09:19.160 --> 09:21.160]  You know, if I've only got one seed, I'll make shit work.
[09:21.160 --> 09:23.160]  Well, I've seen people bank on it.
[09:23.160 --> 09:30.160]  My lemon skunk that I have came as a gift seed from somebody else, and I got one of them.
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.160]  It was a gift from somebody else, and they got it from Greenhouse Seeds, and they got one.
[09:35.160 --> 09:38.160]  I've grown a few killer one-offs in my day as well.
[09:38.160 --> 09:44.160]  And that one that I have is what I have bred the Lemon Jeffrey and Cascade from.
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.160]  One of your first big breeding projects had a plant.
[09:48.160 --> 09:51.160]  I can never remember if it was the bubblegum or the grapefruit.
[09:51.160 --> 09:53.160]  Some of the best stuff I've smoked to this day.
[09:53.160 --> 09:56.160]  And it was just the one-off that we couldn't find again.
[09:56.160 --> 09:59.160]  Right. Yeah. Sometimes if I don't like the way stuff grows or whatever, I just don't.
[09:59.160 --> 10:04.160]  I remember it grew atrociously, but the flavor of it was just, oh, it was so up my alley.
[10:04.160 --> 10:06.160]  Oh, it was the grapefruit. Yeah. I remember that one.
[10:06.160 --> 10:08.160]  I didn't like the way it did its thing.
[10:08.160 --> 10:13.160]  If I don't like the way a plant grows, I'll just get rid of it because, like we were saying, I've got so many seeds.
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.160]  Why not just run more seeds to replace that and have the best of the best?
[10:17.160 --> 10:21.160]  You don't want something that does—if you can find a 10, you don't want a bunch of 7s around.
[10:21.160 --> 10:23.160]  Very, very true.
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.160]  Yeah. All right. So the breeding project I am speaking of is approximately 62-ish days.
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.160]  Tomorrow will be the start of week 10.
[10:33.160 --> 10:37.160]  So it's 63 days. It's nine weeks in, which means it's just about done.
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.160]  I've been taking out one—I've taken out three. I've taken out four seeds now.
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.160]  The fourth seed looked completely ready, so I'm letting it ripen up.
[10:45.160 --> 10:47.160]  And then tomorrow is Monday.
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.160]  Hopefully, if I get all of my work done at a reasonable hour by the end of Monday,
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.160]  I may go in there and start chopping down plants of the new Arise F2 project.
[10:57.160 --> 10:59.160]  I'm loving it. I'm excited for it.
[10:59.160 --> 11:02.160]  It's just a small run. It won't take me a lot of trimming.
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.160]  The way I'll do it is I'm going to cut down one plant and then—
[11:06.160 --> 11:09.160]  These are the ones I saw a week ago, a few days ago.
[11:09.160 --> 11:11.160]  Yeah. Yeah. The little tiny—they're pretty small plants.
[11:11.160 --> 11:12.160]  Yep.
[11:12.160 --> 11:15.160]  So I'll cut them down, take off all the big leaves, hang them upside down,
[11:15.160 --> 11:20.160]  let them dry until they're fairly crispy, basically, and then just cut off a branch,
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.160]  hold it over either a Tupperware dish or a pie plate, and crumble it up, just like a—
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.160]  Just like you're going to—
[11:26.160 --> 11:27.160]  They're pretty crispy when you're harvesting seed.
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.160]  Yeah. Just like you're going to roll up old-school weed and just crunch it up
[11:31.160 --> 11:34.160]  and let the seeds fall out, and then pull out the seeds, pull out the material.
[11:34.160 --> 11:36.160]  We may roll some joints with the dried material,
[11:36.160 --> 11:38.160]  but then a lot of it's going to get turned into concentrates.
[11:38.160 --> 11:41.160]  We'll have some VHO coming up here in just a little while,
[11:41.160 --> 11:45.160]  but then I'll set the seeds aside, let them dry out real well, get them nice and hard,
[11:45.160 --> 11:47.160]  and then I will put them into little packages.
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.160]  I need to get some packages from lecontainers.com, and then get those lined up,
[11:51.160 --> 11:54.160]  get a few of them into some packages, and get them out to my friends that test them out for me,
[11:54.160 --> 11:57.160]  and then I will grow a shit ton of them myself,
[11:57.160 --> 12:02.160]  and I will see if the Arise F2s are worth growing, worth making more of,
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.160]  or if I selected the wrong male, then I'll go back and find another boy of that shit and try again.
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.160]  But since I've used multiple females, I'll keep all the females separate,
[12:10.160 --> 12:15.160]  keep the seeds separated, and I will run comparisons of batch A, batch B, batch C,
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.160]  and I will see which ones I like better so that I can find my breeders.
[12:19.160 --> 12:22.160]  I'm going to do a lot of research and a lot of work and a lot of looking
[12:22.160 --> 12:25.160]  before I even continue—before I even think about making an F2.
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.160]  I want to really see what the F—or before I make an F3, I want to see what the F2s really, really do.
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.160]  So it's almost time to take those down, probably tomorrow night when I get done doing all my work.
[12:33.160 --> 12:36.160]  Then I'll let you guys know how they grow.
[12:36.160 --> 12:38.160]  You know I'll talk about that on the show.
[12:38.160 --> 12:39.160]  So anyone that's been—
[12:39.160 --> 12:40.160]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[12:40.160 --> 12:42.160]  Me too. Me too. I'm really excited about this.
[12:42.160 --> 12:44.160]  If you can't tell, I've been talking about it for a long time.
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.160]  So I want to talk about one more thing before we get into some of the main topics.
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.160]  A couple of—so let me go way far back.
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.160]  About a year and a half ago—we're coming up on two years almost—a year and three quarters ago,
[12:58.160 --> 13:01.160]  I hit my head. I hit the fuck out of my head.
[13:01.160 --> 13:04.160]  Long story short, I hit my head on a low doorway.
[13:04.160 --> 13:07.160]  I'm 6'5". The doorway was probably 6'3".
[13:07.160 --> 13:11.160]  I was walking fast enough to where when I hit the top of my head on this doorway,
[13:11.160 --> 13:13.160]  it knocked me clean the fuck out.
[13:13.160 --> 13:15.160]  I was walking to some stairs.
[13:15.160 --> 13:18.160]  I hit my head, knocked myself out, completely unconscious.
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.160]  I went spaghetti and fell down the stairs while I was completely unconscious.
[13:21.160 --> 13:25.160]  I had to have a couple of friends wake me up, carry me up the stairs, get me in a chair,
[13:25.160 --> 13:27.160]  try to get my shit back together.
[13:27.160 --> 13:29.160]  I was broken, you guys. I had a traumatic brain injury.
[13:29.160 --> 13:31.160]  I had some serious problems.
[13:31.160 --> 13:33.160]  My vision was not right. My brain was not right.
[13:33.160 --> 13:36.160]  My word association wasn't happening properly.
[13:36.160 --> 13:39.160]  My names—I couldn't remember people's names.
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.160]  Like my best friends would be sitting at the table, and I couldn't tell you what the fuck their names were.
[13:42.160 --> 13:44.160]  I was broken. I was having problems.
[13:44.160 --> 13:47.160]  I was having physical problems related to it.
[13:47.160 --> 13:49.160]  Like my body would not regulate its temperature.
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.160]  It was wintertime, and I was running around in just like a t-shirt,
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.160]  and everyone's in coats and shit, and they're looking at me like,
[13:55.160 --> 13:56.160]  do what kind of drugs are you on?
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.160]  I was like, head injury. No drugs.
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.160]  I'm just fucking sweaty all the time now.
[14:00.160 --> 14:02.160]  Like it would not stop being overheated.
[14:02.160 --> 14:04.160]  But something that was also funky was my vision.
[14:04.160 --> 14:06.160]  My vision would get wobbly sometimes.
[14:06.160 --> 14:11.160]  Like if I would watch certain like animated shit or certain TV shows filmed a certain way,
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.160]  my vision would get weird, and I'd just have to quit watching it.
[14:13.160 --> 14:15.160]  Certain video games would fuck with my head.
[14:15.160 --> 14:17.160]  I don't really play video games, but if I watch other people play,
[14:17.160 --> 14:20.160]  some games would mess with my head.
[14:20.160 --> 14:22.160]  Nothing's really messed with me for a little while.
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.160]  I was having dizzy spells for a little while, but everything's pretty much back to normal.
[14:27.160 --> 14:32.160]  I think I'm back on track from all that until I recorded that episode at Elevate a couple of weeks ago.
[14:32.160 --> 14:35.160]  If you guys listen to the podcast, I went to Elevate and recorded a show.
[14:35.160 --> 14:38.160]  There is a rig there by an artist named Matt Cameron.
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.160]  No, it's not Matt. Why do I call him Matt Cameron?
[14:40.160 --> 14:42.160]  I saw the social media posts about this. Now I know where you're going.
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.160]  Yeah, his name is Cameron Reed. Let me correct myself.
[14:45.160 --> 14:47.160]  I think Matt Cameron is a drummer that I watched a video from the other day,
[14:47.160 --> 14:50.160]  but the dude's name is Cameron Reed. Cameron Reed Glass on Instagram.
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.160]  This dude made a rig, and the work is called redicello or ready work is what they call it.
[14:55.160 --> 14:59.160]  And it's just clear glass with white lines through it, and it's fucking beautiful.
[14:59.160 --> 15:02.160]  So I saw this rig, and when I stared at the rig, it started moving.
[15:02.160 --> 15:09.160]  It had kind of a Christmas ornament glass kind of quality to it, if that helps describe it for the listeners.
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.160]  It's trippy to my brain, dude. It makes my brain do weird shit.
[15:13.160 --> 15:18.160]  When I look at it, it looks like it's moving. All of those lines look like they're spinning around like Tron.
[15:18.160 --> 15:20.160]  It's like wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[15:20.160 --> 15:23.160]  And when I stared at it, everybody kind of looked at me like I was crazy.
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.160]  And I was like, oh, you got to quit looking at that because you're the only one seeing that, dude.
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.160]  You got to stop. I was like, okay, I'm going to walk away from this.
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.160]  But then I posted on Facebook basically my experiences.
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.160]  I fell in love with this rig. Unfortunately, you guys, this rig is—
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.160]  I looked at the price tag from underneath because the price tag is on the bottom,
[15:39.160 --> 15:42.160]  and the shelf that's sitting on is glass, so I could see through it.
[15:42.160 --> 15:47.160]  It's either $2,100 or $2,400. I couldn't read if that was a one or a four.
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.160]  That's not in my budget to spend on a glass rig, to tell you the damn truth.
[15:51.160 --> 15:56.160]  It would be awesome to have. I would just stare at it and take dabs out of it and then stare at it some more.
[15:56.160 --> 15:59.160]  So I mentioned this on Facebook. I posted up to Facebook and to Instagram.
[15:59.160 --> 16:01.160]  I pretty much told the same story.
[16:01.160 --> 16:06.160]  Hit my head, my eyes were fucked up, and then I saw this rig, and I was mesmerized, and then I'm in love with it.
[16:06.160 --> 16:14.160]  I posted a picture of the rig, and the artist that made the rig contacted me and sent me a sweet pendant.
[16:14.160 --> 16:19.160]  He sent me a disc pendant. It's probably the size—it's bigger than a silver dollar.
[16:19.160 --> 16:23.160]  It's just a little bit bigger than a silver dollar or—yeah, a little bigger than a silver dollar.
[16:23.160 --> 16:29.160]  It's got some great ready work. It's got a fucking—it's got an opal in the middle of it.
[16:29.160 --> 16:32.160]  I always forget the name of the opals. It's got an opal in the middle of it.
[16:32.160 --> 16:37.160]  I wore it on a chain to the secret sesh the other night, and everybody told me how dope my pendee was.
[16:37.160 --> 16:44.160]  You know what? Guys with blue eyes, all of my friends with blue eyes and blonde hair, or close to the ginger side of life,
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.160]  all of them would look at it, and they would make the same fucking mesmerized face that I make.
[16:50.160 --> 16:53.160]  It's something with blue eyes.
[16:53.160 --> 16:59.160]  A friend of mine, she does eye stuff. I always say the name of her career wrong, but she does eye stuff.
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.160]  She's like, well, I can teach you why. I was like, no, I don't want to learn about my eyes,
[17:02.160 --> 17:07.160]  because if you tell me what my eyes are doing, I'll start feeling it, and it'll fuck with me. I don't want to know.
[17:07.160 --> 17:12.160]  When you say eye stuff, are we talking like American Medical Association certified ophthalmologist?
[17:12.160 --> 17:15.160]  Are we talking like blow sage smoke?
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.160]  No, no. She works at a—she wears scrubs and goes to an eye place every day.
[17:19.160 --> 17:20.160]  She's professional.
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.160]  We know both types of people.
[17:21.160 --> 17:22.160]  Yeah, we do.
[17:22.160 --> 17:24.160]  Eye stuff isn't real clear.
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.160]  I got friends that can fucking rub some Nag Champa on your face and tell you you're going to be okay.
[17:29.160 --> 17:31.160]  Tell me which crystal you carry to keep my bifocals from fucking me up.
[17:31.160 --> 17:34.160]  Nah, nah. She works with a very well-known doctor here in the area.
[17:34.160 --> 17:35.160]  Good. Just double-check it.
[17:35.160 --> 17:38.160]  Yes, she's professional. She's bad as shit at what she does.
[17:38.160 --> 17:41.160]  You can tell she's good at it, because she comes home, and you can tell that she's proud of what she did.
[17:41.160 --> 17:42.160]  So, shout out. Good work.
[17:42.160 --> 17:47.160]  So, I love that there's a style of art that only mesmerizes gingers.
[17:47.160 --> 17:50.160]  Yeah, but she—my friend knows why.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.160]  Or blondes.
[17:51.160 --> 17:53.160]  Yeah, she knows. She can explain why.
[17:53.160 --> 17:55.160]  It's something with the rods and cones and my blue eyes that do it.
[17:55.160 --> 17:59.160]  But Cameron Reed Glass, dude, thank you for the sweet pendant.
[17:59.160 --> 18:01.160]  I love it. I thought it was dope as shit.
[18:01.160 --> 18:02.160]  It does move.
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.160]  It spins around just like that rig that you made, bro.
[18:05.160 --> 18:06.160]  So, it's awesome.
[18:06.160 --> 18:10.160]  If I hold it still in the palm of my hand, it looks like it's fucking spinning, and it's so awesome.
[18:10.160 --> 18:12.160]  I love it. Thank you.
[18:12.160 --> 18:13.160]  Thank you a lot.
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.160]  I hope you hear this.
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.160]  I hope somebody tags you.
[18:15.160 --> 18:16.160]  That's really dope.
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.160]  Or tells you to listen to this podcast somehow.
[18:17.160 --> 18:18.160]  I appreciate it.
[18:18.160 --> 18:20.160]  Also, shout out to all my friends at Elevate Glass, because that's where I saw it.
[18:20.160 --> 18:22.160]  Make sure you guys follow Cameron Reed Glass.
[18:22.160 --> 18:25.160]  He makes sweet glass, and he's a cool-ass dude.
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.160]  So, shout out.
[18:26.160 --> 18:27.160]  I appreciate it. That was a cool fucking gift.
[18:27.160 --> 18:29.160]  Open up the mailbox one day and find this cool-ass pendant.
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.160]  That's killer.
[18:30.160 --> 18:32.160]  All my friends loved it, too, at the secret sesh.
[18:32.160 --> 18:34.160]  So, I had the dopest pen at the sesh.
[18:34.160 --> 18:35.160]  All right.
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.160]  Let's get to the main topic of this podcast now.
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.160]  I've got a couple of screenshots here, because I like to screenshot the messages.
[18:42.160 --> 18:44.160]  It makes it much easier for me to find them.
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.160]  It really does.
[18:45.160 --> 18:46.160]  We've got a really quick message.
[18:46.160 --> 18:48.160]  This one came from Instagram.
[18:49.160 --> 18:52.160]  Usually, I don't say the names, but this dude, he's from North Carolina,
[18:52.160 --> 18:54.160]  and his name is Carolina Cannabis.
[18:54.160 --> 18:55.160]  So, follow him on Instagram.
[18:55.160 --> 19:01.160]  He says, what's something I can use for food for plants besides buying nutrients in a bottle?
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.160]  Growing outdoors in North Carolina, only a few weeks of flowering left.
[19:05.160 --> 19:10.160]  Surprisingly, buds are decently fat, but I know she's probably hungry for something.
[19:10.160 --> 19:13.160]  I'm going to try to get this episode out to you as soon as we can,
[19:13.160 --> 19:16.160]  because you need this information pretty quickly.
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.160]  Pronto on the coast.
[19:18.160 --> 19:22.160]  You say only a few weeks left of flowering.
[19:22.160 --> 19:26.160]  You can't do anything in a bottle, so you're looking for like around the house style?
[19:26.160 --> 19:27.160]  Probably.
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.160]  Okay.
[19:28.160 --> 19:32.160]  But then the grower in me says, where's Jesse when we need him?
[19:32.160 --> 19:34.160]  Jesse is on the coast right now having a good time.
[19:34.160 --> 19:36.160]  I think Jesse's in Portland is where I think he is.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.160]  That a boy?
[19:37.160 --> 19:38.160]  Shout out, bro.
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.160]  Hope you're having a good time.
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.160]  Hashtag earned it.
[19:40.160 --> 19:41.160]  Yeah.
[19:41.160 --> 19:42.160]  Yeah, we can.
[19:42.160 --> 19:43.160]  Yeah.
[19:43.160 --> 19:44.160]  You cut off his ponytail?
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.160]  He looks so handsome now.
[19:45.160 --> 19:46.160]  He's got himself cleaned up.
[19:46.160 --> 19:49.160]  So Mike nailed what I thought most people would say.
[19:49.160 --> 19:51.160]  You want to use some guanos.
[19:51.160 --> 19:53.160]  You're going to want to use some alpha meal.
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.160]  You're going to want to use something like that.
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.160]  But you've only got a couple of weeks left,
[19:57.160 --> 19:59.160]  so you don't want to pump a whole bunch of stuff into the plants.
[19:59.160 --> 20:04.160]  And most of those organic products are going to take at least two weeks to four weeks
[20:04.160 --> 20:07.160]  to closer to six or eight weeks to even break down and be available.
[20:07.160 --> 20:09.160]  I was going to say, it sounds like you missed your shot.
[20:09.160 --> 20:10.160]  Yeah.
[20:10.160 --> 20:11.160]  There are a few things.
[20:11.160 --> 20:12.160]  There's some good news, though.
[20:13.160 --> 20:17.160]  Nature-wise, the plants are supposed to have used up most of what's around it by now.
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.160]  Yes.
[20:18.160 --> 20:19.160]  That's as intended.
[20:19.160 --> 20:22.160]  But there are a couple of things that you can do if you don't want to go buy bottles.
[20:22.160 --> 20:26.160]  You've only got a few weeks left, so keep in mind that you're going to want to flush.
[20:26.160 --> 20:27.160]  Even outdoors, you need to flush your plants.
[20:27.160 --> 20:30.160]  You need a time period where they're not receiving any nutrients
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.160]  so that they can start to get rid of the shit that's stored up in them
[20:33.160 --> 20:37.160]  so that your buds burn and taste and smell perfectly at the right time.
[20:37.160 --> 20:39.160]  So keep that in mind.
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.160]  Give yourself hopefully 10 to 14, maybe 15 to 16, maybe 20 days.
[20:43.160 --> 20:45.160]  I like to flush for a long time.
[20:45.160 --> 20:47.160]  Well, if you haven't been feeding up to this point either,
[20:47.160 --> 20:49.160]  you don't want to hit them with too much now.
[20:49.160 --> 20:50.160]  You'll shock the hell out of them.
[20:50.160 --> 20:53.160]  He says he knows they're probably hungry for something.
[20:53.160 --> 20:56.160]  If he hasn't boosted them up, they probably are.
[20:56.160 --> 21:01.160]  What I would recommend, if you want to feed them something, like I said earlier,
[21:01.160 --> 21:02.160]  some guanos would be cool.
[21:02.160 --> 21:04.160]  Some stuff like that would be cool.
[21:04.160 --> 21:05.160]  But some comfrey would be nice.
[21:05.160 --> 21:07.160]  Maybe make up a nice tea.
[21:07.160 --> 21:08.160]  That's probably your best bet.
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.160]  Make a tea.
[21:10.160 --> 21:15.160]  A tea with some worm castings, some alfalfa meal in there.
[21:15.160 --> 21:19.160]  Maybe put a little tiny bit of molasses in there just to keep it moving.
[21:19.160 --> 21:22.160]  And then any sort of kelp meal or something, make a tea out of that.
[21:22.160 --> 21:26.160]  And this is just coming to me, so I'm trying to go as smoothly as I can here.
[21:26.160 --> 21:30.160]  Maybe put some, I'm not sure what all you are willing to use either,
[21:30.160 --> 21:34.160]  but kelp meal would definitely help you get some bulk and some flavor.
[21:34.160 --> 21:36.160]  Maybe put some fish hydrosolates in there.
[21:36.160 --> 21:38.160]  That would help you out with some nitrogen.
[21:38.160 --> 21:43.160]  If you make a tea like this, brew it up for just a couple of few days.
[21:43.160 --> 21:45.160]  And if you need instructions on making a tea, send me an email,
[21:45.160 --> 21:47.160]  and we'll try to get Jesse on here to help us with that.
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.160]  But I'll answer you.
[21:48.160 --> 21:51.160]  You sent me this message on Instagram, so send me a message on Instagram,
[21:51.160 --> 21:53.160]  and hopefully I can run you through making a tea.
[21:53.160 --> 21:54.160]  It's really easy.
[21:54.160 --> 21:55.160]  But make a tea.
[21:55.160 --> 21:56.160]  Feed the plants the tea.
[21:56.160 --> 22:02.160]  If you can't make a tea, then some basic fish hydrosolates in a bottle would work.
[22:02.160 --> 22:03.160]  Pour that.
[22:03.160 --> 22:04.160]  Put some water into a five-gallon bucket.
[22:04.160 --> 22:07.160]  Put a little more than what the label says of fish hydrosolates in there.
[22:07.160 --> 22:08.160]  Mix it up real well.
[22:08.160 --> 22:09.160]  Put some molasses in there.
[22:09.160 --> 22:11.160]  Mix that up.
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.160]  And then maybe some kelp.
[22:12.160 --> 22:14.160]  Any sort of kelp product that you can put in there.
[22:14.160 --> 22:17.160]  Liquid kelp would be more available, but that's a bottled product.
[22:17.160 --> 22:21.160]  If you don't want to do that, I think a tea would be your best way to go.
[22:21.160 --> 22:23.160]  Jesse and I have done episodes about making teas.
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.160]  That is a thing that's available.
[22:26.160 --> 22:27.160]  If you don't want to search for that, send me a message.
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.160]  I'll either find it for you, or I will reply to you on Instagram.
[22:31.160 --> 22:33.160]  I was just doing the math in my head.
[22:33.160 --> 22:35.160]  This is going to come out.
[22:35.160 --> 22:46.160]  If this show doesn't come out immediately, he's only got three weeks from when we're recording it at most of grow time left.
[22:46.160 --> 22:49.160]  If he's on the East Coast, if I've got my numbers right in my head.
[22:49.160 --> 22:52.160]  Some of our friends in Colorado are actually harvesting this weekend.
[22:52.160 --> 23:00.160]  I talked to people higher up in elevation than we are down here in Pueblo that are a little further up into the foothills.
[23:00.160 --> 23:02.160]  Harvest began last week.
[23:03.160 --> 23:06.160]  They're dipping below 50 at night.
[23:06.160 --> 23:07.160]  It's just what's up.
[23:07.160 --> 23:08.160]  The plants are done.
[23:08.160 --> 23:09.160]  You should see them.
[23:09.160 --> 23:10.160]  They're huge.
[23:10.160 --> 23:15.160]  I actually went to two different grows, one that was about 700 feet higher up in elevation than the other.
[23:15.160 --> 23:18.160]  I went to the higher one first.
[23:18.160 --> 23:20.160]  Buds were almost done.
[23:20.160 --> 23:23.160]  They were going to give them three more days at harvest.
[23:23.160 --> 23:28.160]  I drove down the road a few hundred feet, and buds were three weeks from harvest.
[23:28.160 --> 23:29.160]  Wow.
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.160]  Just a little bit closer to the sun.
[23:30.160 --> 23:31.160]  Yep.
[23:31.160 --> 23:32.160]  Which side of the mountain?
[23:32.160 --> 23:33.160]  Our side.
[23:33.160 --> 23:34.160]  Okay.
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.160]  What are we, east of the Rockies?
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.160]  We both had to think about that.
[23:39.160 --> 23:43.160]  The mountains are west, and so I had to quick do the where on the…
[23:43.160 --> 23:44.160]  I know which direction I'm going.
[23:44.160 --> 23:46.160]  People are like, how do you always know where you're going?
[23:46.160 --> 23:47.160]  The mountains are right over there all the time.
[23:47.160 --> 23:51.160]  If you've been in Colorado more than a year, you know how to get to wherever you're going because of that.
[23:51.160 --> 23:52.160]  Check it out.
[23:52.160 --> 23:54.160]  Since Mike was talking for a second, I got a chance to write this down.
[23:54.160 --> 23:57.160]  If you need to make a tea, get yourself a five-gallon bucket.
[23:57.160 --> 23:58.160]  Get a clean bucket.
[23:58.160 --> 23:59.160]  Go to Lowe's.
[23:59.160 --> 24:00.160]  Pay a couple bucks.
[24:00.160 --> 24:01.160]  Get a clean bucket.
[24:01.160 --> 24:02.160]  Get yourself…
[24:02.160 --> 24:04.160]  Go to the hydro store or the fish store.
[24:04.160 --> 24:07.160]  Get an air pump that pumps out quite a bit of air.
[24:07.160 --> 24:09.160]  Get yourself one of those air stones.
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.160]  Put the air stone in the bucket to where…
[24:11.160 --> 24:12.160]  Fill the bucket with water.
[24:12.160 --> 24:19.160]  If you can, put the air stone in there and get that air stone pumping that water with a lot of oxygen for 24 hours before you do anything.
[24:19.160 --> 24:22.160]  Your goal here is to get the chlorine out of that water.
[24:22.160 --> 24:23.160]  That's what you're trying to do.
[24:23.160 --> 24:24.160]  So, bubble that.
[24:24.160 --> 24:25.160]  Get the chlorine out.
[24:25.160 --> 24:27.160]  The next day, add some worm castings.
[24:27.160 --> 24:29.160]  Add some alfalfa sprouts.
[24:29.160 --> 24:32.160]  Add some kelp meal and add a little tiny bit of molasses.
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.160]  Let that bubble for like 24 hours.
[24:35.160 --> 24:37.160]  It's going to get foamy.
[24:37.160 --> 24:38.160]  Expect it to get foamy.
[24:38.160 --> 24:43.160]  It will foam up like a beer and go everywhere if you're not careful.
[24:43.160 --> 24:44.160]  It may or may not.
[24:44.160 --> 24:46.160]  It depends on your witch's brew.
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.160]  The proteins in the fish hydrosolates…
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.160]  I didn't write fish hydrosolates.
[24:49.160 --> 24:50.160]  Put fish hydrosolates in there.
[24:50.160 --> 24:51.160]  The proteins in the fish hydrosolates…
[24:51.160 --> 24:54.160]  I helped a guy shampoo the smell out of his carpet one time.
[24:54.160 --> 24:55.160]  Fair warning, listeners.
[24:55.160 --> 24:59.160]  Be careful what your witch's brew does the first time you make it because sometimes it foams up like a song.
[24:59.160 --> 25:00.160]  Yes.
[25:00.160 --> 25:01.160]  What I would recommend…
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.160]  This will make enough…
[25:03.160 --> 25:06.160]  If you use this five-gallon bucket, you could probably cut this in half.
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.160]  Or if you're going outdoor, you can just pour the whole five-gallon bucket on there if you want to.
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.160]  But it's getting toward the end of the season.
[25:12.160 --> 25:13.160]  Keep that in mind.
[25:13.160 --> 25:14.160]  It's almost time to harvest.
[25:14.160 --> 25:15.160]  You don't want to go huge.
[25:15.160 --> 25:16.160]  So, take your five-gallon bucket.
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.160]  Fill it with water.
[25:18.160 --> 25:19.160]  Put the bubble in there.
[25:19.160 --> 25:20.160]  Bubble it long enough to get the chlorine off.
[25:20.160 --> 25:23.160]  Then you pour in the fish hydrosolates, worm castings.
[25:23.160 --> 25:24.160]  Alfalfa sprouts.
[25:24.160 --> 25:25.160]  Is that the right one?
[25:25.160 --> 25:26.160]  Is that what I want to use?
[25:26.160 --> 25:27.160]  I think that's what you want.
[25:27.160 --> 25:28.160]  Kelp meal and molasses.
[25:28.160 --> 25:29.160]  Pour those things in there.
[25:29.160 --> 25:31.160]  There are more things that you could use.
[25:31.160 --> 25:32.160]  You could use crab meal.
[25:32.160 --> 25:33.160]  You could use bone meal.
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.160]  You could use fish meal if you want to.
[25:35.160 --> 25:36.160]  Those things are not all necessary.
[25:36.160 --> 25:37.160]  Put that in there.
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.160]  Let that shit stew around in that bubbles for like 12 to 24 hours.
[25:41.160 --> 25:42.160]  It's going to make a bunch of foam.
[25:42.160 --> 25:44.160]  Do it in the garage if you have to.
[25:44.160 --> 25:47.160]  Do it somewhere where it's easy to clean up, where you're not worried about a bunch of foam.
[25:47.160 --> 25:50.160]  If it does not foam up, that does not mean it's bad.
[25:50.160 --> 25:51.160]  Let it bubble up.
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.160]  Then go outside and pour it on your plants.
[25:54.160 --> 25:56.160]  Not on the plants, near the root zone.
[25:56.160 --> 25:58.160]  Water your plants with it.
[25:58.160 --> 25:59.160]  Don't go near the stalk.
[25:59.160 --> 26:06.160]  Go out because your roots that eat the most and drink the most are the ones that are on the outer perimeter of the plant, not right there at the stalk.
[26:06.160 --> 26:09.160]  The part of the stalk is always going to have some moisture down there at the bottom.
[26:09.160 --> 26:10.160]  Go on the outer edge.
[26:10.160 --> 26:11.160]  That's where your growing roots are.
[26:11.160 --> 26:13.160]  The plants are reaching out for stuff.
[26:13.160 --> 26:15.160]  Go out there a little bit.
[26:15.160 --> 26:17.160]  Your best bet is to make a tea.
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.160]  Water with this tea.
[26:19.160 --> 26:21.160]  Hopefully you'll see a little bit of boost in there.
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.160]  The fish hydroslates are going to give you a little bit of nitrogen.
[26:23.160 --> 26:26.160]  The worm castings are going to give you microbes.
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.160]  It's going to help everything.
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.160]  The worm castings will provide a little tiny bit of nitrogen, but they'll also speed everything up.
[26:31.160 --> 26:35.160]  The alfalfa meal is going to give you nitrogen that's readily available.
[26:35.160 --> 26:38.160]  The kelp meal, I just think that that makes everything stink.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.160]  It makes it smell better.
[26:40.160 --> 26:41.160]  It makes it taste better.
[26:41.160 --> 26:42.160]  It adds to density.
[26:42.160 --> 26:45.160]  When I talk to organic growers, one of the first things that comes up is kelp.
[26:45.160 --> 26:49.160]  The ocean products are always going to make your stuff taste better, in my opinion.
[26:49.160 --> 26:50.160]  Then molasses.
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.160]  Molasses will actually feed all of the worm casting microbes.
[26:54.160 --> 26:57.160]  It will also feed your plants a little bit as well.
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.160]  That's what you can do outdoors, but also keep in mind, bro, it's time to start flushing.
[27:01.160 --> 27:04.160]  You're right at the end of your clock, bud.
[27:04.160 --> 27:07.160]  Sorry we didn't get this question sooner and out to you sooner.
[27:07.160 --> 27:12.160]  I'm not blaming anything on Jesse, but man, Jesse was busy as shit this year, so we didn't do many outdoor episodes.
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.160]  Jesse, next year, Jesse, let's just sit down and record a whole season of outdoor.
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.160]  Get him once and do 11 episodes in one little day.
[27:19.160 --> 27:20.160]  He's hard to nail down.
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.160]  He came by the other day and smoked me down with some distillate that his company's making, and it was delicious.
[27:24.160 --> 27:27.160]  The last time I saw him in person, I asked him, how's this going?
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.160]  He went on for like 45 minutes about projects he's currently working on.
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.160]  He's easily one of the three busiest people I know.
[27:34.160 --> 27:35.160]  Yes.
[27:35.160 --> 27:37.160]  Shout out to our friend, Carolina Cannabis on Instagram.
[27:37.160 --> 27:38.160]  Make sure you guys follow him.
[27:38.160 --> 27:41.160]  I got his beautiful cannabis growing skills and photography.
[27:41.160 --> 27:43.160]  Dude, thank you for the message.
[27:43.160 --> 27:45.160]  Feel free to send me more messages.
[27:45.160 --> 27:47.160]  I want to see how your grow comes out.
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.160]  I want to know if I answered your question in the way you needed to answer it.
[27:49.160 --> 27:51.160]  Anybody else that has a message, please send it to me.
[27:51.160 --> 27:59.160]  It would be easiest if you initiate a conversation by sending me an email to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:59.160 --> 28:02.160]  If we're already corresponding on another social media platform, keep it going.
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.160]  It's easiest just to keep one conversation happening because if you jump to another platform, I'm going to fucking get confused.
[28:07.160 --> 28:09.160]  If you're new, go to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.160]  That's the best way to get in touch with me.
[28:11.160 --> 28:14.160]  I'll get your questions on an upcoming episode.
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.160]  I'm trying to get through the questions quickly because I know some of the questions are urgent because you got plants growing and you need shit to happen.
[28:19.160 --> 28:21.160]  I'm trying to get on it.
[28:21.160 --> 28:23.160]  I'm trying to do more episodes for you.
[28:23.160 --> 28:30.160]  I've got another thing I want to read before I get to the basement and legislation question that I've got.
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.160]  I saw something on Facebook the other day, and I thought it was very entertaining.
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.160]  Right after I did an episode about trim machines, in a recent episode, we talked about trim machines, and I kind of bashed the shit out of them.
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.160]  Somebody said, which trim machine to buy, and I said, don't buy a bunch of fucking scissors and get your friends over.
[28:43.160 --> 28:46.160]  That's basically what I told them because that's really what I think you should do.
[28:46.160 --> 28:48.160]  No, preach it, brother.
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.160]  Somebody on Facebook, I don't know if he wants to be named or not.
[28:52.160 --> 28:54.160]  He's known as Soda Pop.
[28:54.160 --> 28:58.160]  He says, upcoming Croptober helpful hints, and we call it Croptober.
[28:58.160 --> 29:00.160]  Yes, October is Croptober in Colorado.
[29:00.160 --> 29:02.160]  Everybody needs a trimmer.
[29:02.160 --> 29:04.160]  Everybody needs to get some shit trimmed.
[29:04.160 --> 29:07.160]  Yeah, every California, the whole coast, but okay.
[29:07.160 --> 29:12.160]  I've seen trim-agrant memes recently, so it's a thing in lots of places.
[29:12.160 --> 29:14.160]  Trim-agrants are coming.
[29:14.160 --> 29:25.160]  So helpful, Croptober, or upcoming Croptober helpful hints, and this dude says, number one, if you want to process your trim into quality meds, please do not use a machine trimmer.
[29:25.160 --> 29:30.160]  There's oils from machine, and the beaten trim lead to unsightly slabs.
[29:30.160 --> 29:37.160]  So he's saying that there's oils actually in the trim machine, on the blades of the trim machine, on the metal parts of the trim machine.
[29:37.160 --> 29:39.160]  That shit's got to be lubricated somewhere.
[29:39.160 --> 29:43.160]  Every auto trimmer I have ever used had moving parts, which require lubrication.
[29:43.160 --> 29:50.160]  Yep, so those oils will end up on your trim, and that beaten up trim, like I said before, it turns into basically mulch.
[29:51.160 --> 29:55.160]  When the trim is cut into so many pieces, when you cut it with scissors, you cut it one time.
[29:55.160 --> 29:56.160]  You cut that leaf off the plant.
[29:56.160 --> 29:58.160]  I mean, maybe three or four.
[29:58.160 --> 30:01.160]  But you're not making mulch.
[30:01.160 --> 30:03.160]  You're not turning it into, you're not lawnmowering it.
[30:03.160 --> 30:14.160]  Yeah, this trim machine's hitting it, and just mulching all your little pieces, and that leaves that many spots for moisture, that much surface area for moisture, and that many spots for chlorophyll to come out.
[30:14.160 --> 30:16.160]  You want to hit it with scissors.
[30:17.160 --> 30:20.160]  You're like half-juicing the product into the final.
[30:20.160 --> 30:21.160]  Exactly.
[30:21.160 --> 30:22.160]  I mean, it's not good.
[30:22.160 --> 30:26.160]  It does juice it, and then that juice ends up in your hash, and it tastes like shit and looks like shit.
[30:26.160 --> 30:35.160]  And then number two, he says, if you plan to process the nug, please flush correctly and no spraying or pesticides whatsoever.
[30:35.160 --> 30:43.160]  These chemicals and nutrients tend to leach into concentration and lead to unsightly slabs.
[30:43.160 --> 30:46.160]  So, he's saying flush properly, flush correctly.
[30:46.160 --> 30:51.160]  Well, he's using unsightly, and there's a lot implied there, especially in a market like Colorado's.
[30:51.160 --> 30:52.160]  Yes.
[30:52.160 --> 31:03.160]  If you've sprayed your plants with just about anything while they're in flower, and it's processed into a concentrate, that concentrate's not going to pass testing and make it onto the market.
[31:03.160 --> 31:07.160]  Most of the people he's talking about, I think he's talking about these black market street growers.
[31:07.160 --> 31:09.160]  Well, yeah, it's, I mean, unsightly.
[31:09.160 --> 31:11.160]  Because most of us in a warehouse environment know this.
[31:12.160 --> 31:14.160]  None of this is going to make it onto a-
[31:14.160 --> 31:15.160]  Right.
[31:15.160 --> 31:16.160]  No spraying.
[31:16.160 --> 31:17.160]  Absolutely.
[31:17.160 --> 31:18.160]  If you're going to make concentrates, think about this.
[31:18.160 --> 31:20.160]  You guys, you're going to spray some shit.
[31:20.160 --> 31:21.160]  Okay, you're spraying.
[31:21.160 --> 31:23.160]  What is everybody using?
[31:23.160 --> 31:25.160]  Azomax is probably one of the most popular things.
[31:25.160 --> 31:31.160]  When I worked in the dispensary area, I've toured a couple of dispensaries, and all of them have Azomax on the shelf.
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.160]  That's the most common spray.
[31:33.160 --> 31:38.160]  And we're going to talk about something that Azomax is going to do in a future episode that I've got written down.
[31:38.160 --> 31:40.160]  But everyone's got the Azomax.
[31:41.160 --> 31:44.160]  I'm sure, and now you spray, it's kind of waxy, it's kind of oily.
[31:44.160 --> 31:48.160]  You spray Azomax onto your plants at like probably, I don't know, week two, week three.
[31:48.160 --> 31:51.160]  That shit's in the middle of your buds as your bud grows around it.
[31:51.160 --> 31:56.160]  That waxy, oily concentration is still there, and the buds just grow around it, and it's still inside there.
[31:56.160 --> 32:01.160]  Then the buds dry, and you grind it up, and you run it through an extraction machine and wash it off.
[32:01.160 --> 32:07.160]  You can actually see that little layer of Azomax right on top of your concentrate sometimes.
[32:07.160 --> 32:08.160]  I've seen it.
[32:08.160 --> 32:09.160]  I've seen it float to the top.
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.160]  I have fucking tasted it.
[32:11.160 --> 32:15.160]  I've been in rooms that have, I have sprayed, I didn't know any better when I started growing.
[32:15.160 --> 32:19.160]  But remember back in the day when we did not know any better, we would spray whatever the fuck to do to the hydro.
[32:19.160 --> 32:20.160]  I've got this problem.
[32:20.160 --> 32:21.160]  Spray this.
[32:21.160 --> 32:22.160]  Okay.
[32:22.160 --> 32:26.160]  And then you read five years later, like, this causes immediate blindness if you touch it.
[32:26.160 --> 32:28.160]  You're like, oh, fuck, I used to spray that.
[32:28.160 --> 32:30.160]  I've sprayed these things.
[32:30.160 --> 32:32.160]  So I have also smelled them.
[32:32.160 --> 32:37.160]  I'm glad I did because now I can smell them and taste them in other people's products.
[32:37.160 --> 32:38.160]  Neem oil is a big one.
[32:38.160 --> 32:39.160]  Oh, God.
[32:39.160 --> 32:45.160]  It's something a lot of the organic or the natural people like to use at one point or another.
[32:45.160 --> 32:47.160]  And if you use that shit in flour.
[32:47.160 --> 32:49.160]  My face puckered up a little when you said neem.
[32:49.160 --> 32:57.160]  It's everybody that consumes cannabis at one point or another has hit a bowl, and all they tasted for the next hour was neem.
[32:57.160 --> 33:00.160]  They might not have known what it was.
[33:00.160 --> 33:03.160]  But it's, I mean, that's incredibly common.
[33:03.160 --> 33:05.160]  Just quit spraying shit that's in flour.
[33:05.160 --> 33:06.160]  Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[33:06.160 --> 33:07.160]  Man's environment.
[33:07.160 --> 33:08.160]  Yeah.
[33:08.160 --> 33:13.160]  So flush correctly and don't spray bullshit on your plants if you're trying to make concentrates out of it.
[33:13.160 --> 33:14.160]  You know, that's a general rule.
[33:14.160 --> 33:22.160]  If you're going to use, if you're making medicine or something you want other people to consume, flush properly and don't spray shit on your plants.
[33:22.160 --> 33:27.160]  Number three, take proper care of nug and trim that would be for use in extracts.
[33:27.160 --> 33:33.160]  Proper cure, care, cleaning, and basic hygiene of the plant and material are critical for quality meds.
[33:34.160 --> 33:39.160]  You guys, one thing that I don't see enough of is people wearing nitrile or rubber gloves.
[33:39.160 --> 33:40.160]  Wear some gloves.
[33:40.160 --> 33:45.160]  You don't want all your finger skin in my concentrates or on my flowers.
[33:45.160 --> 33:47.160]  When you're trimming that shit, it's sticky.
[33:47.160 --> 33:48.160]  Wear some gloves, please.
[33:48.160 --> 33:49.160]  I don't want to smoke your skin flakes.
[33:49.160 --> 33:50.160]  We're bros.
[33:50.160 --> 33:51.160]  We're friends.
[33:51.160 --> 33:52.160]  I love you.
[33:52.160 --> 33:54.160]  I do not want to smoke your fucking hands.
[33:54.160 --> 33:56.160]  Also, take care of stuff.
[33:56.160 --> 34:05.160]  Just because it's going to get turned into hash doesn't mean you can trim your leaves into a tarp on the floor and have the whole crew walk on them during trim time and then sweep them up and make hash out of them.
[34:05.160 --> 34:06.160]  That's fucking gross.
[34:06.160 --> 34:07.160]  Trim that into a container.
[34:07.160 --> 34:08.160]  Take care of it.
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.160]  That's somebody's medicine.
[34:09.160 --> 34:11.160]  You may make edibles out of it.
[34:11.160 --> 34:15.160]  Think about, like, look at it all as something that you're going to put into your mouth.
[34:15.160 --> 34:22.160]  And if you're one of them dirty fucking people that lays shit off the floor, look at it as something that a princess has to put in their mouth because it's got to be clean products.
[34:23.160 --> 34:25.160]  Also, cure your shit.
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.160]  Just because you're going to blast it, I understand.
[34:27.160 --> 34:28.160]  Live resin.
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.160]  Let's get it on.
[34:29.160 --> 34:38.160]  Well, there was that weird thing at the beginning of the butane hash days where you made BHO with this stuff you couldn't use, the stuff that was trash.
[34:38.160 --> 34:39.160]  Right.
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.160]  I remember people saying some crazy shit like, oh, if it's moldy, just blast it.
[34:42.160 --> 34:45.160]  Yeah, powdery mildew doesn't exist anymore since we have BHO.
[34:45.160 --> 34:46.160]  Right.
[34:47.160 --> 34:55.160]  But if you want to make good concentrates, you really have to produce bud that's ready to go on a store shelf.
[34:55.160 --> 34:56.160]  Yes.
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.160]  And then make concentrates from that.
[34:57.160 --> 34:58.160]  Out of that bud.
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.160]  And I see so many people that fuck up that last step.
[35:02.160 --> 35:05.160]  And it's like buying a Lamborghini and wrecking it, like, in the lot.
[35:05.160 --> 35:08.160]  You're not even off the lot yet, and you wreck it.
[35:08.160 --> 35:12.160]  You spent nine weeks flowering, and then you just spent a week harvesting, and now you're just going to fuck it up.
[35:12.160 --> 35:13.160]  Yeah.
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.160]  You might as well throw it in the trash.
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.160]  Once you flush that plant, you can cut it down and knock off most of the big leaves.
[35:20.160 --> 35:25.160]  And if you plan on blasting the entire plant, hang it up, let it – oh, excuse me, I'm burping up some Dr. Pepper.
[35:25.160 --> 35:31.160]  Hang it upside down, let it dry and cure, cut it off the sticks, take the sticks out of there, and then you've pretty much got blastable material.
[35:31.160 --> 35:33.160]  You can't really fuck that up.
[35:33.160 --> 35:36.160]  So just take care of it, keep it clean, wear gloves.
[35:36.160 --> 35:44.160]  You wouldn't believe some of the stuff that I have seen and heard of coming in from, like, grows coming into extraction labs.
[35:44.160 --> 35:53.160]  People have found cigarette butts, scissors, razor blades, forks from lunch, like, all kinds of shit in the material.
[35:53.160 --> 36:09.160]  It was so bad two years ago when we started implementing lab testing that a number of extract companies just went out and bought the 100,000 or 200,000 or 300,000 pieces of equipment so that they could in-house lab test shit as it came in.
[36:09.160 --> 36:15.160]  Because it was – some of the stuff they were processing was so nasty, it was fucking up their machines.
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.160]  And so they processed the dude for the first guy – or the material for the first guy in the morning.
[36:20.160 --> 36:22.160]  It dirties up the machine.
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.160]  Everybody else that gets run that day is taking home a piece of that trash that came through in the morning.
[36:28.160 --> 36:30.160]  Just a little residual hazmatics or whatever on there.
[36:30.160 --> 36:36.160]  And so now they're testing it all before it goes into their machinery so that none of that's possible anymore.
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.160]  That's disgusting, thinking about somebody – another farm running some stuff and throwing some hazmatics in there.
[36:41.160 --> 36:45.160]  And then my farm running this clean organic product in there and just mixing it up.
[36:45.160 --> 36:47.160]  And now I've got your hazmatics residuals.
[36:47.160 --> 36:48.160]  That's kind of gross.
[36:48.160 --> 36:54.160]  I cringe when I see stuff like black market stuff where they're like, just got some awesome sap.
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.160]  And you look at it and it's black and soupy.
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.160]  And God only knows what's in it.
[37:00.160 --> 37:03.160]  I mean, we're so lucky here that we've got lab testing.
[37:03.160 --> 37:04.160]  So lucky.
[37:04.160 --> 37:07.160]  We've got some regulation that we can get away from that.
[37:07.160 --> 37:10.160]  I wish it was more available to the recreational grower.
[37:10.160 --> 37:13.160]  Lab testing is not as available, but in the future it will be.
[37:13.160 --> 37:18.160]  Yep, that's one of the things that I'm going to hit coming up in this last question.
[37:18.160 --> 37:23.160]  All right, so speaking of perfect timing, we're 36 minutes into this podcast and we have not gotten to the main topic.
[37:23.160 --> 37:27.160]  So shout out to Soda Pop for the cool Facebook post.
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.160]  At the end, he hashtagged that, the machine knows the truth.
[37:31.160 --> 37:32.160]  Yep.
[37:32.160 --> 37:34.160]  So supports my claims that trim machines suck.
[37:34.160 --> 37:35.160]  Don't use a trim machine.
[37:35.160 --> 37:39.160]  Take care of your plants and take care of the trim and nug if you plan to make extractions.
[37:39.160 --> 37:41.160]  Good luck out there this croptober season.
[37:41.160 --> 37:42.160]  I hope your plants made it.
[37:42.160 --> 37:44.160]  I hope none of them got stolen.
[37:44.160 --> 37:46.160]  I hope that if thieves did take your shit.
[37:46.160 --> 37:47.160]  Well, that's one of the things I want to say is be safe.
[37:47.160 --> 37:48.160]  Yeah.
[37:48.160 --> 37:49.160]  It's that time of year.
[37:49.160 --> 37:50.160]  We call it croptober.
[37:50.160 --> 37:52.160]  We also call it homie season.
[37:52.160 --> 37:54.160]  Stuff goes missing right now.
[37:54.160 --> 37:56.160]  Yeah, ripper season.
[37:56.160 --> 37:58.160]  I've seen some social media stuff already.
[37:58.160 --> 38:00.160]  Because if they took your shit, they're not your homie.
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.160]  Well, right now it's getting close to harvest.
[38:04.160 --> 38:07.160]  If you're growing outdoors in any way, shape or form, it's smelling.
[38:07.160 --> 38:09.160]  It's probably sleeping out there.
[38:09.160 --> 38:10.160]  Yep.
[38:10.160 --> 38:13.160]  Anybody who's been out for the last six months knows it's there.
[38:13.160 --> 38:14.160]  You're freaking out.
[38:14.160 --> 38:15.160]  Just take some deep breaths.
[38:15.160 --> 38:16.160]  Relax.
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.160]  Your shit getting stolen is not the worst thing that can happen to you.
[38:20.160 --> 38:23.160]  And if they did take your shit, I hope they left part of it for you.
[38:23.160 --> 38:24.160]  I hope they were a cool thief.
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.160]  And if you had four plants, I hope they only took one.
[38:27.160 --> 38:30.160]  It's just unfortunate that we still have to deal with this.
[38:30.160 --> 38:31.160]  Yes.
[38:31.160 --> 38:32.160]  All right.
[38:32.160 --> 38:33.160]  So I wish we could just grow out.
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.160]  Nobody comes to steal the tomatoes in the backyard.
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.160]  Why are they stealing cannabis when cannabis is somebody's cancer medicine?
[38:38.160 --> 38:39.160]  That's shitty.
[38:39.160 --> 38:42.160]  It's just worth so much in certain places.
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.160]  I mean, it's like leaving your bank account in the backyard in some places.
[38:46.160 --> 38:47.160]  Yeah.
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.160]  Nobody that listens to this show would steal any plants.
[38:49.160 --> 38:52.160]  Let's jump into this email that I got.
[38:52.160 --> 38:54.160]  This email, this dude signed his name, Dab Smiths.
[38:54.160 --> 38:56.160]  And he says, Hey, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[38:56.160 --> 38:58.160]  Huge fan of the podcast, as I've said before.
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.160]  He said, I had a few questions I thought could be a podcast.
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.160]  I'm in Michigan and we just passed three bills pushing us into a seed to
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.160]  sale system based on Colorado system.
[39:08.160 --> 39:11.160]  I'm going to quickly talk about that in Colorado.
[39:11.160 --> 39:12.160]  We have a seed to sale system.
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.160]  Everything that is for sale recreational or medically in the state of
[39:16.160 --> 39:23.160]  Colorado has been grown from seed or a clone underneath a Colorado marijuana
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.160]  enforcement division camera inside of a Colorado marijuana enforcement
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.160]  division regulated facility, also known as an optional premises cultivation
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.160]  facility, everything that happens in there, every square fucking inch of
[39:35.160 --> 39:37.160]  this facility is on camera.
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.160]  They have it set up to where if you can be in that building and there is a
[39:41.160 --> 39:44.160]  spot where you're not on camera, you have to put another camera.
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.160]  If you can hide around this little partition or behind this door, they want
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.160]  another camera in there so that you cannot hide anywhere.
[39:51.160 --> 39:54.160]  So everything that happens in there is on camera, which that's where the
[39:54.160 --> 39:55.160]  seed part starts.
[39:55.160 --> 39:57.160]  If you grow a seed, it's on camera.
[39:57.160 --> 39:59.160]  If you grow a clone, it is on camera.
[39:59.160 --> 40:02.160]  It is a given an RFID tag.
[40:02.160 --> 40:03.160]  We call those a med tag.
[40:03.160 --> 40:07.160]  You have to tag every single plant and put it into a system known as metric.
[40:07.160 --> 40:08.160]  Then they are tagged.
[40:08.160 --> 40:09.160]  They are accounted for.
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.160]  They're part of your plant count that you're allowed to have.
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.160]  When a regular walks into a room, they've got a tool that they can just
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.160]  hold up and press a button and it tells them exactly how many plants are in
[40:19.160 --> 40:20.160]  that room.
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.160]  Yes, because of the RFID on those plant tags.
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.160]  I mean, everything is tracked down ridiculously in Colorado.
[40:26.160 --> 40:27.160]  Ridiculously.
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.160]  So as those plants grow, they are now clones in my computer system.
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.160]  When I put them into bigger pots, now they have to be clicked into veg.
[40:34.160 --> 40:38.160]  If I move them to another room, they have to be marked in this little tab on
[40:38.160 --> 40:40.160]  the computer what room they move into.
[40:40.160 --> 40:43.160]  When I move them into flower, I have to move them.
[40:43.160 --> 40:44.160]  I have to change their room.
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.160]  I have to change their status.
[40:46.160 --> 40:49.160]  And I have to mark that all the tags are still the same numbers.
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.160]  Everything stays on camera.
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.160]  When it's harvested, all of the trimmers are in a room.
[40:54.160 --> 40:55.160]  Guess what?
[40:55.160 --> 40:56.160]  They're all on camera.
[40:56.160 --> 40:58.160]  Everything is done on camera.
[40:58.160 --> 40:59.160]  It's trimmed.
[40:59.160 --> 41:01.160]  The trim is kept in one area.
[41:01.160 --> 41:02.160]  The trash is weighed.
[41:02.160 --> 41:05.160]  All of the trash is weighed before it's thrown away so that we know.
[41:05.160 --> 41:06.160]  And everything is weighed.
[41:06.160 --> 41:09.160]  I cut down the plant, put it on a scale, hand it to the trimmers.
[41:09.160 --> 41:12.160]  They separate buds and sticks and trim.
[41:12.160 --> 41:13.160]  We weigh the buds.
[41:13.160 --> 41:14.160]  We weigh the trim.
[41:14.160 --> 41:15.160]  We weigh the trash.
[41:15.160 --> 41:16.160]  We throw the trash away.
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.160]  The weight of the trash is documented in the Marijuana Enforcement Division
[41:19.160 --> 41:21.160]  computer, which is known as metric.
[41:21.160 --> 41:23.160]  So everything is on camera.
[41:23.160 --> 41:27.160]  Then it is put into specific weight packages.
[41:27.160 --> 41:30.160]  The packages are documented in a computer with a tag number on it.
[41:30.160 --> 41:33.160]  That tag, again, has an RFID code on it.
[41:33.160 --> 41:39.160]  Then they are put into what's called a manifest, a transfer manifest.
[41:39.160 --> 41:43.160]  Then that transfer manifest has the vehicle operator's name,
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.160]  driver's license number, license plate number, vehicle make, model, description.
[41:47.160 --> 41:50.160]  Then you have to type in the exact route that you are traveling,
[41:50.160 --> 41:53.160]  leaving this street, turning left on this street,
[41:53.160 --> 41:55.160]  right onto this street to the destination.
[41:55.160 --> 41:58.160]  Then once you get there, it is unpacked and checked on camera
[41:58.160 --> 42:00.160]  by the dispensary that it's taken to.
[42:00.160 --> 42:02.160]  Then it's put on a shelf all under camera.
[42:02.160 --> 42:04.160]  Then it is sold all under this.
[42:04.160 --> 42:11.160]  Everything is recorded and covered, and there's absolutely no room for leakage.
[42:11.160 --> 42:14.160]  The only time that anything could happen is in a vehicle.
[42:14.160 --> 42:17.160]  But if you're following Marijuana Enforcement Division rules,
[42:17.160 --> 42:22.160]  every package that leaves the Grove facility is vacuum sealed in a vacuum bag
[42:22.160 --> 42:25.160]  with a Marijuana Enforcement Division sticker on it
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.160]  that has a specific weight written on it with a string name on it.
[42:29.160 --> 42:32.160]  Then that is also on a paper that matches that tag number
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.160]  that has the corresponding weight.
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.160]  I can't even tell you how many hundreds of shipments in my day,
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.160]  and not one of them was off by anything ever.
[42:40.160 --> 42:41.160]  Right. Yeah.
[42:41.160 --> 42:42.160]  Well, you can't.
[42:42.160 --> 42:45.160]  If they're in those vacuum sealed bags and I open it in the car while I'm driving,
[42:45.160 --> 42:46.160]  there's no way for me to fucking seal that.
[42:46.160 --> 42:48.160]  It's like, yeah, why is this razor knife to open?
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.160]  Yeah. And that's the only opportunity, really, and that's not going to happen.
[42:52.160 --> 42:53.160]  Nobody's going to get away with it.
[42:53.160 --> 42:55.160]  You're going to get caught if you do that stupid shit.
[42:55.160 --> 42:56.160]  Yep.
[42:56.160 --> 42:59.160]  Highly, highly, highly, highly regulated is what we're getting at.
[42:59.160 --> 43:01.160]  Yes. So that is the seat to sail system.
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.160]  And Michigan is now, that was one of the three bills they just passed,
[43:04.160 --> 43:06.160]  is a seat to sail regulatory system.
[43:06.160 --> 43:08.160]  And it works. It actually works.
[43:08.160 --> 43:09.160]  It works really well.
[43:09.160 --> 43:11.160]  And I know this, it sounds stringent and it sounds ridiculous,
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.160]  but when we have problems like we've recently talked about on the show,
[43:15.160 --> 43:18.160]  there have been batches of concentrates that have been made with flowers
[43:18.160 --> 43:23.160]  that were sprayed with pesticides that were not allowed since each plant was tracked.
[43:23.160 --> 43:28.160]  And when we apply a pesticide, we write down every tag number that that pesticide is applied to
[43:28.160 --> 43:31.160]  or a foliar spray or any type of soil treatment.
[43:31.160 --> 43:34.160]  Yeah, all that soil treatment, everything that happens to the plant is tracked.
[43:34.160 --> 43:41.160]  And you can see that everything grown in facility number 403 extracted by extraction company 402,
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.160]  and there's B dashes at the end of those, everything from that batch was contaminated.
[43:46.160 --> 43:51.160]  Plant tag number 1,000, 6,555 through 1,000 fucking whatever.
[43:51.160 --> 43:55.160]  Yeah, the state just releases a list, retailers check the serial numbers on their product,
[43:55.160 --> 43:59.160]  and you know instantly if you're carrying some tainted product.
[43:59.160 --> 44:02.160]  If it's cannabis or hash or edibles or topicals,
[44:02.160 --> 44:04.160]  you can pull all of that off the shelf safely.
[44:04.160 --> 44:09.160]  For sale in the legal market in Colorado, you can follow all of it from origin to retail and back.
[44:09.160 --> 44:13.160]  So it's absolutely helpful even though it seems really, when you're doing it, it seems obnoxious.
[44:13.160 --> 44:15.160]  It's a huge pain in the ass getting it implemented.
[44:15.160 --> 44:18.160]  You know, it took me a couple of months of working with,
[44:18.160 --> 44:22.160]  but after like a month or two of doing metric every single day, I was like, oh, this is easy.
[44:22.160 --> 44:24.160]  It's just what you do, it becomes part of your routine.
[44:24.160 --> 44:27.160]  You just treat your workday like chess moves.
[44:27.160 --> 44:28.160]  Yeah.
[44:28.160 --> 44:30.160]  And as soon as you accept that, you're good to go.
[44:30.160 --> 44:35.160]  I would make notes on a little piece of paper of things that I needed to do in metric as I did it.
[44:35.160 --> 44:38.160]  And then I would go to the office and just catch up metric right before lunch
[44:38.160 --> 44:41.160]  and then go back and catch up metric right before I leave at the end of the day.
[44:41.160 --> 44:45.160]  Or when it got down to cutting clones and doing things that needed a lot of metric attention,
[44:45.160 --> 44:50.160]  I had a little cart and I would just take my MacBook to work and sign into metric right there and just do it on the cart.
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.160]  It was second nature by the time I was done there.
[44:53.160 --> 44:55.160]  So the seed to sale system is definitely helpful.
[44:55.160 --> 44:56.160]  I think it's going to work.
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.160]  I'm going to continue with the email because this is going to be a long damn podcast if I don't.
[45:00.160 --> 45:06.160]  He said, Michigan, we passed three bills pushing us into a seed to sale system based on Colorado system.
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.160]  I was wondering if you and White Mike could touch on the subject.
[45:10.160 --> 45:17.160]  Like, how do I go about finding out information from the city about how many licensed facilities they will allow?
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.160]  And then he also says, what's the biggest hurdle going from a basement grow to a warehouse,
[45:21.160 --> 45:23.160]  which I think is more directed at me.
[45:23.160 --> 45:29.160]  Then he continues to say, I know you have recently made the switch from soil to cocoa and any advice on that transition.
[45:29.160 --> 45:32.160]  I am planning on running Veg Bloom and I'm already in a basement.
[45:32.160 --> 45:35.160]  But do you add anything else to the line as well?
[45:35.160 --> 45:44.160]  What are some things you didn't expect going to such a large scale and any other advice you may think one would need to know about taking a leap into the big leagues?
[45:44.160 --> 45:45.160]  Thanks again for such a great podcast.
[45:45.160 --> 45:52.160]  I hope you can answer some questions for me and other questions.
[45:52.160 --> 45:55.160]  Others, I'm not sure how you wanted to end that, but yes, we'll answer your question, bro.
[45:55.160 --> 45:58.160]  I'll let Mike go with the first part because I've got a lot of stuff to say.
[45:58.160 --> 46:00.160]  First of all, lawyer up.
[46:00.160 --> 46:04.160]  If you're going to get into the cannabis industry, lawyer up.
[46:04.160 --> 46:07.160]  Get a lawyer and then get another lawyer to make sure that that lawyer is not fucking with you.
[46:07.160 --> 46:09.160]  And then get a lawyer to keep an eye on your account.
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.160]  Get two lawyers and an accountant to make sure they're all fucking keeping an eye on each other.
[46:13.160 --> 46:15.160]  That's my first bit of advice.
[46:15.160 --> 46:20.160]  That should really be like the first half of like every business school 101 class.
[46:20.160 --> 46:21.160]  Yes.
[46:21.160 --> 46:22.160]  Yeah.
[46:22.160 --> 46:24.160]  Make sure your lawyer and don't want to be too good a friend.
[46:24.160 --> 46:28.160]  Hopefully your lawyer and your accountant don't seem like they like each other because then they can't team up on you.
[46:28.160 --> 46:30.160]  They don't you don't want them embezzling from you.
[46:30.160 --> 46:31.160]  Just keep them watching each other.
[46:31.160 --> 46:32.160]  I think he's stealing from me.
[46:32.160 --> 46:33.160]  I think he's stealing from you.
[46:33.160 --> 46:34.160]  Just keep him like that.
[46:34.160 --> 46:36.160]  Keep him watching.
[46:36.160 --> 46:45.160]  So, Mike, the first question, how do we go about finding out information from the city about how many licensed facilities they will allow?
[46:45.160 --> 46:48.160]  Before we before we hit record, we I jumped online.
[46:48.160 --> 46:54.160]  We jumped online and checked out some of the stuff about your law in Michigan.
[46:54.160 --> 46:56.160]  Local control is part of it.
[46:56.160 --> 47:02.160]  And so this is from the cannabis surprise, surprise reported here in Colorado.
[47:03.160 --> 47:22.160]  But according to the cannabis, the local control part in Michigan's law is growers, processors, shippers, testing facilities and dispensaries could not obtain a state license unless their local government adopts an authorizing ordinance.
[47:22.160 --> 47:29.160]  Municipalities could cap the number of licenses within their borders and assess no more than a five thousand dollar fee per license.
[47:29.160 --> 47:35.160]  A state board would charge application and renewal fees to cover costs, including for substance abuse programs and law enforcement.
[47:35.160 --> 47:42.160]  So basically what that means is you're going to need two licenses to open any sort of marijuana business in Michigan.
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.160]  And we're talking about medical marijuana businesses here.
[47:45.160 --> 47:48.160]  Recreational is not quite legal in Michigan yet, I don't think.
[47:49.160 --> 48:00.160]  So if your local area does not create some sort of licensing process for these businesses, you can't get a state license to operate in that area.
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.160]  So how do you find out what those rules are in your area?
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.160]  The first step is head to your local planning and zoning.
[48:12.160 --> 48:20.160]  Hop online, spend a few seconds with Google, figure out where your planning and zoning department is.
[48:20.160 --> 48:32.160]  And while you're there, you can want to look up city council or county commissioner, whichever sort of governing body decides the land use rules for your area.
[48:32.160 --> 48:38.160]  So for example, here in Pueblo, Colorado, in the city we have a city council who makes those decisions.
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.160]  And then in the county of Pueblo, we have a board of county commissioners.
[48:42.160 --> 48:50.160]  These people are totally separate and have totally different rules for marijuana businesses because they're totally separate governmental entities.
[48:50.160 --> 48:52.160]  I assume it's very similar in Michigan.
[48:52.160 --> 49:00.160]  So first step is figure out which municipality, city, county, whatever you want to have your marijuana businesses in.
[49:00.160 --> 49:07.160]  Head down to planning and zoning or city council or whatever and ask is your first step.
[49:07.160 --> 49:15.160]  And because this is brand new, you're likely to be met with a confused look, which means you've got some work ahead of you.
[49:16.160 --> 49:34.160]  If you're lucky, the area you're in has favorable government officials who saw this coming and have already crafted some sort of land use code specifying which zoning designations the property for these businesses have to carry.
[49:34.160 --> 49:39.160]  Distances from schools, libraries, churches, those kinds of rules.
[49:40.160 --> 49:47.160]  If they haven't gotten that far yet, you're looking at a year or more of public hearings while these rules get hashed out.
[49:47.160 --> 49:50.160]  So like I said, you've got some work ahead of you.
[49:50.160 --> 49:56.160]  This is where I sort of got my activist credentials in Pueblo was helping Pueblo do all of this.
[49:57.160 --> 50:05.160]  So when you've checked with planning and zoning to see a if your area has these rules yet and if not, how they're being created.
[50:05.160 --> 50:09.160]  The next thing to do is get yourself involved in that conversation.
[50:09.160 --> 50:15.160]  It's really easy to do, especially as these rules are being crafted.
[50:16.160 --> 50:26.160]  Whatever governmental agencies crafting this rules will take a lot of public comment to get the community's input, how far they want them from schools, how high the licensing fee should be.
[50:26.160 --> 50:30.160]  If they want to add any sort of other rules and regulations.
[50:30.160 --> 50:39.160]  For example, there's an area in Colorado that requires marijuana businesses to be 100% energy neutral, which means they can't consume electricity.
[50:39.160 --> 50:44.160]  They don't also generate wrap your head around that one in a county that doesn't allow outdoor growing.
[50:45.160 --> 50:49.160]  But get involved with these in this conversation now.
[50:49.160 --> 50:57.160]  And that way you can help nudge or guide the regulators as they write the rules for your area.
[51:00.160 --> 51:07.160]  If you're smart, you'll help them steer clear of business number caps and things like that.
[51:07.160 --> 51:09.160]  That's really, really, really bad for business.
[51:09.160 --> 51:11.160]  It just creates monopolies, right?
[51:11.160 --> 51:14.160]  It immediately creates a monopoly.
[51:14.160 --> 51:24.160]  It forces the local municipality to do a bunch of obnoxious things like having a license lottery and some sort of review process for applicants.
[51:24.160 --> 51:27.160]  That's additionally unnecessary.
[51:27.160 --> 51:35.160]  I mean, it creates a real legislative and practical nightmare for the government agency trying to do it.
[51:35.160 --> 51:40.160]  And yet in Colorado, they continue to do it all over and over and over again.
[51:41.160 --> 51:43.160]  But just get involved with this conversation now.
[51:43.160 --> 51:57.160]  And in all likelihood, you'll be able to steer whatever local government agency that's writing these rules into crafting smart rules for your agency so that you're not looking at huge licensing fees.
[51:57.160 --> 52:01.160]  I like that they have a cap in the state rules at five grand.
[52:01.160 --> 52:06.160]  I've seen it as high as 50 here in counties and cities.
[52:06.160 --> 52:10.160]  The state only charges five or seven or ten, depending on the size of your license.
[52:10.160 --> 52:13.160]  But I've seen individual counties charge much, much more than that.
[52:15.160 --> 52:18.160]  So he's going to need a ton of money, a lawyer, an accountant.
[52:18.160 --> 52:21.160]  Now, you said planning and zoning and city council.
[52:21.160 --> 52:25.160]  Should he also join forces with his local marijuana activist groups?
[52:25.160 --> 52:28.160]  That depends on the climate in your area.
[52:28.160 --> 52:41.160]  If you go down to planning and zoning and are greeted by a really friendly person who hands you a printout of the rules they've already crafted, and all you have to do is fill out the application and find a piece of property that's zoned appropriately and get a rental agreement.
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.160]  Well, congrats, bro.
[52:43.160 --> 52:45.160]  You live in a really enlightened area.
[52:45.160 --> 52:54.160]  But what's likely to happen is you're going to be met with a confused look, and they're only going to just be creating these rules now.
[52:55.160 --> 53:05.160]  And so if that's the case, your best bet is to start attending county meetings, zoning meetings, just watching how those meetings take place.
[53:05.160 --> 53:13.160]  Getting a feel for the people in charge of those meetings, who's on your city council, who's on your board of county commissioners or your zoning board.
[53:13.160 --> 53:15.160]  What do they like and dislike?
[53:15.160 --> 53:19.160]  And basically, it just takes a lot of sitting and watching.
[53:19.160 --> 53:23.160]  I mean, watching laws get made is incredibly boring.
[53:23.160 --> 53:27.160]  But they're legalizing marijuana across the country.
[53:27.160 --> 53:29.160]  We have to write all those laws.
[53:29.160 --> 53:38.160]  If you don't want really, really messed up laws written by people who don't understand what we're doing and what we're working with, stand back and wait for somebody else to do it.
[53:38.160 --> 53:43.160]  I mean, some of the rules that were proposed here in Colorado during this process were asinine.
[53:43.160 --> 53:51.160]  And it took a while for people like myself to explain to legislatures why it was asinine.
[53:51.160 --> 53:55.160]  Because at face value, a lot of them seemed like a good idea.
[53:55.160 --> 54:00.160]  But when you take it into practice, like the last episode, we talked about edibles labeling.
[54:00.160 --> 54:03.160]  They were ready to get rid of all drinks.
[54:03.160 --> 54:05.160]  We'll get rid of them, period.
[54:05.160 --> 54:13.160]  It's never been a problem anywhere, but we're going to cut out a massive section of the edibles industry just for no reason at all.
[54:13.160 --> 54:16.160]  But the people that are making these rules are not consumers.
[54:16.160 --> 54:17.160]  They are not producers.
[54:17.160 --> 54:18.160]  They're just people.
[54:18.160 --> 54:19.160]  They're council members.
[54:19.160 --> 54:21.160]  Sometimes they don't know anything about it.
[54:21.160 --> 54:25.160]  Their background is in finance, and they were a dentist for 20 years or some shit.
[54:25.160 --> 54:39.160]  They don't know anything about mass production of cannabis, retail rules, what those rules might be for alcohol and tobacco retailers, why little tweaks to those rules are appropriate for cannabis.
[54:39.160 --> 54:43.160]  I mean, getting them to understand all that can be quite a bit of work.
[54:43.160 --> 54:46.160]  And they've probably got some fear in them also.
[54:46.160 --> 54:54.160]  Yeah, you have to go into this knowing that most of the people you talk to were the hall monitor.
[54:54.160 --> 55:03.160]  Not to be a dick about it, but when you start going to city government meetings, you're like, that's what happened to all those people from high school.
[55:03.160 --> 55:06.160]  They just disappeared from my world after graduate.
[55:06.160 --> 55:07.160]  They've got jobs in city government.
[55:07.160 --> 55:08.160]  That's where they all went.
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.160]  Yep, they're all.
[55:09.160 --> 55:10.160]  Jeff went on tour.
[55:10.160 --> 55:18.160]  All these people got jobs at their local zoning department and have worked their way through the ranks of city bureaucracy for 20 years.
[55:18.160 --> 55:20.160]  Those are the people you're dealing with, and they're not bad people.
[55:20.160 --> 55:25.160]  Most of them are wonderful, but they don't really know anything about marijuana.
[55:25.160 --> 55:26.160]  They don't know why we consume it.
[55:26.160 --> 55:28.160]  They don't know why it's fun at concerts.
[55:28.160 --> 55:31.160]  They just know it gives them a headache when they go see popular music.
[55:31.160 --> 55:34.160]  And that's really the extent of their education.
[55:34.160 --> 55:48.160]  So, getting them to understand that moving all marijuana production indoors is incredibly bad for the environment, especially when cannabis can be grown so effectively outdoors.
[55:48.160 --> 55:58.160]  That conversation, we failed at having a lot of places in Colorado, which is why Pueblo County is so popular with production facilities right now.
[55:58.160 --> 55:59.160]  We're loaded.
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.160]  Yep, we're one of the few places you can grow outdoors.
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.160]  And we're one of the few places you can grow in greenhouses.
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.160]  And we're one of the few places where land isn't ridiculously expensive.
[56:09.160 --> 56:13.160]  I mean, we've got the trifecta down here, and that's why we have so many companies located down here.
[56:13.160 --> 56:16.160]  And it's changing the whole landscape here.
[56:16.160 --> 56:17.160]  You can tell that there's some money here now.
[56:17.160 --> 56:21.160]  We didn't have any money here before, and you can tell that there's actually some future for this place.
[56:22.160 --> 56:42.160]  Had our county commissioners followed suit with Denver and Aurora and Boulder and Longmont and Lakewood and banned outdoor growing, banned greenhouse growing, pushed it all indoors, the economic recovery we have enjoyed has been very, or would have been very different.
[56:43.160 --> 56:52.160]  And so in Michigan, I know you guys have been taking economic hit after economic hit for the last, my whole life, sorry.
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.160]  This can really be an economic engine for growth and prosperity.
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.160]  And it's not a tidal wave of money that's going to fix everything.
[57:07.160 --> 57:13.160]  I watched the video on Detroit not too long ago where people were disassembling skyscrapers and selling parts of scrap.
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.160]  Like active skyscrapers or old skyscrapers?
[57:18.160 --> 57:19.160]  Like old ones.
[57:19.160 --> 57:20.160]  Okay, as long as there are still people in them.
[57:20.160 --> 57:26.160]  The amount of recession in Detroit is significantly different than what we see here.
[57:26.160 --> 57:34.160]  Even though we've got, Pueblo and Detroit have gone through similar things, the scale is very different.
[57:37.160 --> 57:45.160]  In a state like Michigan, marijuana really could be two or three or 20 or 30,000 jobs.
[57:45.160 --> 57:47.160]  Oh yeah, it could bring it back.
[57:47.160 --> 57:50.160]  Now these people aren't all going to be making 75,000 a year.
[57:50.160 --> 57:56.160]  A lot of them are going to be making 10, 50 an hour, 12, 50 an hour, 14 an hour.
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.160]  But that's still thousands of jobs.
[58:01.160 --> 58:07.160]  You're still talking about hundreds of millions of dollars into improving properties and bringing them up to code.
[58:07.160 --> 58:13.160]  And when Jeff starts talking about is what do you need to know going from greenhouse to warehouse?
[58:13.160 --> 58:21.160]  The improvements that are required in a lot of the warehouses to get them up to where he's going to get at, that costs a lot of money.
[58:21.160 --> 58:24.160]  And that improvement is massive for the area.
[58:24.160 --> 58:29.160]  We had a, excuse me, we needed to upgrade our airflow system a little bit at Green and Healthy.
[58:29.160 --> 58:31.160]  And I was getting some estimates.
[58:31.160 --> 58:38.160]  We're trying to connect two rooms, two sides of a building and just run it through one air conditioning thing and handle some humidity and some air control through one thing.
[58:38.160 --> 58:41.160]  Then he goes, oh yeah, probably six to 8,000 each side to make that happen.
[58:41.160 --> 58:44.160]  It's just for a small air exchange setup.
[58:44.160 --> 58:47.160]  So just it's going from the home to the commercial.
[58:47.160 --> 58:52.160]  When he said 8,000 each side, I was like, oh, this is going to take a second.
[58:54.160 --> 59:01.160]  Just the economic boom a state can feel if this is done correctly, if it's done smartly.
[59:01.160 --> 59:17.160]  And to have it done correctly really takes people willing to do the legwork, to go to city council meetings, to go to state legislature meetings and make sure that they don't do thousand foot from everywhere rules.
[59:18.160 --> 59:26.160]  I remember here in Pueblo, the first proposal I saw for buffer zones, the distance your marijuana business has to be from other stuff.
[59:26.160 --> 59:32.160]  There were like 25 different businesses on there, like nursing homes, all kinds of different stuff.
[59:32.160 --> 59:34.160]  Schools, churches, liquor stores, pharmacies, nursing homes.
[59:34.160 --> 59:45.160]  There was a specific business name because they specifically seek out adults with developmental disabilities as employees.
[59:46.160 --> 59:52.160]  That's that company's kind of niche is giving that whole segment of the population a great job.
[59:52.160 --> 59:58.160]  And our original legislation had a thousand feet from their property.
[59:58.160 --> 01:00:04.160]  And then in the middle of all of this, Colorado redefined what a thousand feet from a school meant.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.160]  They changed how it's measured halfway in through the game.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:18.160]  And it wasn't like feet to inches kind of distance, but it was what they call as the crow flies versus walking.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:31.160]  And so originally dispensary owners walked out their front door and took the street on foot version to the nearest school and then applied that way, saying that they were a thousand three hundred feet from a school.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.160]  And then they changed the rule to ask the crow flies.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:42.160]  And it turns out the nearest pieces of their property lines are only six hundred feet apart because of it.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:49.160]  And that was literally the only mass shutdown of businesses we had in Colorado is because that rule changed.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:57.160]  And so, I mean, for you, when Jeff first told me this was a question, I was like, dude, that's a whole podcast.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.160]  We can't do that as part of a thing because where your state is right now.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:11.160]  And honestly, this applies to like 14 different states across the country, depending on what happens in November's election.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:18.160]  14 different states will be going through the process we're talking about right now or are about to be, depending on how the election goes.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.160]  So a lot of you need to start thinking about this. Who makes these decisions in your area?
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.160]  What kind of process is that? What does it look like? How do I get involved in that?
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.160]  If you don't make those decisions and start writing those rules, somebody will write them for you.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:41.160]  Yep. And unfortunately for you, this wasn't as bad when Colorado was doing this.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.160]  The anti-pop movement is very vocal now.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:54.160]  It was just the DEA and the police and law enforcement in the prisons and police unions when Colorado was doing this.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.160]  Now there are parents groups who are freaked out.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:04.160]  And when you get into this, mainly you'll find that the anti-pop groups are just people who didn't have anything in their world and needed a something.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:11.160]  And trying to remind us all that in eighth grade, we learned that pot is bad has become their goal in life.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:19.160]  And they're not very good at research or arguments.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160]  We just got a mailer or a flyer in the mail.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.160]  Yeah, we're dealing with a nasty one of these down here in Pueblo.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:30.160]  But the one thing they really, really are is vocal.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160]  Yes.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:40.160]  And when you do get involved in this process in your area, one of the first things you're going to realize is that the old dude who shows up to every meeting and won't shut up about whatever their topic is,
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.160]  everybody that's involved in city government knows that asshole's topic intimately.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:53.160]  They know every in and out of it and they're sick of hearing about it for one reason, because that dude shows up and makes a lot of noise.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.160]  And that's what the anti-pop people do.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.160]  They'll rally 35 or 40 church moms.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.160]  They'll show up in force to two or three hearings.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:07.160]  And all of a sudden, your city doesn't get to enjoy any of the economic benefits of legalization.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:20.160]  And every marijuana consumer in that geographic area that wants to participate in the legal market has to drive to the next county to do so because of who showed up at a meeting.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:27.160]  You really, really, really need to start taking a look at this, especially if you want to be part of the industry as an owner.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  You've got a chance to get in on the ground floor right now if you're willing to put in serious legislative legwork.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.160]  That's my half of the question.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.160]  I just glanced over a second.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.160]  I was like, we're in an hour and two minutes.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.160]  I'm almost tempted to make this a two-part question and cut this dude off now and make another episode out of this.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.160]  Your half of the question is huge because there's a lot of stuff.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.160]  I mean, we can give them the glance over if you want.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.160]  No, I think we would.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160]  There's enough.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.160]  I mean, he asked like four questions in here, so I think we're going to make this a two-parter.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.160]  Are you down to record a little bit more with me?
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.160]  I totally am, and I could use like a two-minute break.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.160]  I knew you needed a stretch break, a cigarette break.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.160]  I could use a fresh drink and a couple of dabs.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:14.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this podcast is gone just over an hour.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.160]  I would rather record two episodes out of this.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  Mike and I are going to take some dabs.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160]  Let's do this.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  If you have more questions.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.160]  I'll do this for you, listeners, because we kind of do this on the fly.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.160]  Can I twist your arm and make this a Thursday episode or a Wednesday episode?
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.160]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160]  We're going to put these out.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160]  One is going to be a Monday.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.160]  One is going to be a Thursday, so that way they're close together.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:34.160]  I don't know if this is, for me, this is more than interesting enough to do a week teaser,
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.160]  and I think our listeners are that dedicated, but I want to hook them up and do it closer if we can.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.160]  I've been trying.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.160]  A lot of times I try to do two episodes a week, but I can't commit to that.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  I can't dedicate to that, so I haven't made the promise.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.160]  We have trouble getting one of these together a month now just because we're both busy adults.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.160]  Right, but we're going to make sure that these two episodes come out on a Monday and a Thursday,
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.160]  back-to-back, quick like that.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.160]  You guys, if you like this content that comes from listeners and listener-generated material, send me an email.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160]  It's growfromyourheart.com.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]  I'm going to wrap it up quickly.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.160]  Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.160]  It's NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]  Follow the podcast.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.160]  It's at GFYH Podcast on Twitter.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.160]  I've got a Facebook page.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.160]  It's Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.160]  I think that's all we're going to do for this week.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160]  Mike's sneaking away to go use the men's room.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160]  He's going to grab a cigarette.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160]  I'm going to take some dabs, and then we're going to record another episode.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:10:00.860]  It's time for episode number 159 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.860]  That's right.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.860]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:09.860]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.860]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:13.860]  I'm your host.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:14.860]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.860]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:22.860]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout-out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.860]  Big shout-out to Kat, Toot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of the last episode.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:35.860]  I almost said last week's episode, but it'll still be this week because I'm going to put these out back-to-back.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.860]  I won't make you wait too long, just a couple, maybe three days.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.860]  A little wait.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.860]  Yeah. Mike is back sitting across the table from me.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:42.860]  We just stepped outside for a minute.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.860]  What's up, everybody?
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:44.860]  Mike had a couple of cigarettes.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:45.860]  I had one.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.860]  A cigarette.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:47.860]  That was pretty quick.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.860]  Keeping it quick.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.860]  Pretty quick.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]  So welcome back.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.860]  It's 158.5, but we're going to call it 159 to keep the feed going.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.860]  158.5, part two, some shit like that.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.860]  Part deer.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.860]  Yeah.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.860]  So, dude, welcome back.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.860]  Man, it's getting a little bit chilly out there.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.860]  Mike and I just hung outside while Mike had a cigarette.
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.860]  It's getting a little bit crispy.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.860]  I wish I had a hoodie while I was out there.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.860]  All you outdoor growers, your shit's going to get purple.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.860]  It's that time of year.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.860]  Everybody's going to be carrying a jacket around.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.860]  All my friends that are sleeping outside, they're outdoor, girl.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.860]  I feel for you right now.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.860]  Yep.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.860]  It's not as comfortable as it was last week.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.860]  Get the heavy bag out.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.860]  Yeah, you're going to have to start a campfire or some shit.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.860]  I hope you got your dog out there keeping you warm.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.860]  No campfire.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.860]  No campfire?
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:28.860]  Light.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:29.860]  Light.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860]  Plants.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.860]  I don't know.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.860]  I don't know.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.860]  I don't know.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.860]  Is that light?
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.860]  It's light.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.860]  Is that the right kind of light?
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.860]  It's the right kind of light.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.860]  I really don't know.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.860]  All right.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860]  So, yeah, hopefully you're warm outside.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.860]  Hopefully you're listening to this while you're trimming down your outdoor crops.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.860]  It's just about croptober.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.860]  It's outdoor season.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860]  It's time to harvest.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.860]  It's dependent on where you're living.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.860]  They're coming down now.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:49.860]  And what strain you're growing.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.860]  If you've got some flow or some blueberry, it might be a time.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:54.860]  If they're not coming down while you're listening to this, you better be flushing.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.860]  Or watching.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.860]  Yeah, flushing for sure.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.860]  All right, let's put this train wreck of a podcast back on some rails.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.860]  We're only two minutes and 30 seconds in and we're already rambling.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of an episode that we did a few...
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:05.860]  Actually, we recorded it like an hour ago.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.860]  You heard it a few days ago.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.860]  There was an email and it started off with questions for Mike, and then there was a part
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:16.860]  two that had questions about going from a basement grow into a large facility.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.860]  So let me catch you up on the email.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.860]  I'll read it all the way from the beginning.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.860]  It says, hey, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860]  Huge fan of the podcast, as I've said before.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.860]  I had a few questions I thought could be a podcast.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.860]  I'm in Michigan.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.860]  We just passed three bills pushing us into a seed to sale system based on Colorado system.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.860]  I was wondering if you and White Mike could touch on the subject.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.860]  Like, how do I go about finding out information from the city about how many licensed facilities
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.860]  they will allow?
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.860]  That part we handled on the last episode.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:43.860]  I hope you listened to it.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.860]  If not, press pause, go back, listen to number 158 and check it out.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.860]  Then come back and see us.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:55.860]  So the second part of the question, what we are going to address today, he says, what is the biggest hurdle
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.860]  going from a basement grow to a warehouse?
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.860]  I know you've recently made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:01.860]  Any advice on that transition?
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.860]  Then he also says, I'm planning on using VegBloom.
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.860]  I'm already in the basement, but do you add anything else to their line as well?
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:14.860]  What are some things you didn't expect going to a large scale and any other advice you think one would need
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.860]  to know about taking the leap into the big leagues?
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.860]  And he says, thanks for such a great podcast.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.860]  I hope you can answer some questions for me.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.860]  We already answered half of it.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.860]  Let's get into the second half of it.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:26.860]  The part where I need to jump in.
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.860]  Hey, Mike, thanks for doing such a great job with the first half of this dude's question.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:30.860]  You really fucking nailed it for him.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.860]  Thanks, man.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]  Awesome.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.860]  And I hope I, I hope I answered your question.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.860]  If you need further elaboration on any point, hit me up on social media.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:39.860]  Please do.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:40.860]  We love hearing from all of you, from everybody.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.860]  I love listener generated content.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.860]  This is an amazing question.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.860]  So we had to do a two-parter episode to answer it.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860]  You can send me your emails.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.860]  You guys, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860]  I'm going to get into the question.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.860]  It goes, if I didn't say like last episode, thanks again for the killer question.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.860]  Yes.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.860]  Thanks.
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860]  Yeah, this is a great question.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860]  We've, we've gotten normal.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.860]  We're going to get two hours worth of content out of this question.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.860]  He says, um, where is it?
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.860]  What is the biggest hurdle going from a basement grow to a warehouse?
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.860]  There are a lot of things to think about there.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.860]  One of the biggest things that I noticed was different was the airflow.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.860]  Um, a large building, the air doesn't flow like it does in a small room.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.860]  You can change the air out in a small bedroom in a matter of minutes with a
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.860]  small blower, a large room, you're going to have hot spots.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.860]  You're going to have cool spots.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:25.860]  You're going to find humid spots.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:29.860]  You're going to need to learn how to control that temperature and that
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.860]  humidity all throughout a large room.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:37.860]  It's the scale of the increases where every, I mean, many legal retailers and
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:42.860]  production facilities are still problem shooting their, their multimillion
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:47.860]  dollar grows because the difference in scope from a basement grow or a smaller
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.860]  grow to a huge warehouse is, is monumental.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:54.860]  A good, reliable HVAC company in Colorado that will come work on a grow
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.860]  and knows what they're doing.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.860]  Uh, we'll make you wait three months just to come give you an estimate
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.860]  because they are so backed up with cannabis grows right now.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:06.860]  Um, if, if I had enough money to do anything I wanted cannabis business wise,
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:11.860]  I would build from the ground up, um, because I've seen what so many companies
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:17.860]  have had to go through attempting to improve an existing structure, um, to,
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.860]  to where it's not giving them problems.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:23.860]  I know so many people that, I mean, they thought they had everything under
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.860]  control.
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.860]  And then as the season started to change, one whole wall was, uh, the
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:34.860]  temperature change in that wall was causing major problems in a grow.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.860]  Um, I mean, and that's not a unique problem that happened to a lot of people.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.860]  If you're one wall, you're whichever, whichever side gets the most sun or the
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.860]  least sun, it just kind of depends on your environment.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.860]  When the seasons change in Colorado, you'll usually see in a grow that you've
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:50.860]  never been in before.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.860]  You have to find out where the powdery mildew is going to happen when the first
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.860]  winter comes.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.860]  You just got to find out where it's going to happen because it probably will.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.860]  If you, if you haven't designed your room flawlessly, you're on one wall,
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.860]  you're probably going to get, if you've got an exterior wall,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.860]  you're going to get powdery mildew there when the season.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.860]  You and I can problem shoe a basement grow or a bedroom grow in like 20
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:13.860]  minutes, an hour or two.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.860]  Uh, I mean, and by troubleshooting,
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.860]  I mean like find the problems and suggest easy ways to fix them.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.860]  I can walk into like a basement grow and point out 10 things in 10 seconds that
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.860]  we can improve your grow and make it more efficient.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.860]  In a warehouse grow part of it's just putting in the time, right?
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.860]  Um, to get through the cycle,
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.860]  where your huge heating and cooling,
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.860]  a lot of people don't aim for enough cooling.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.860]  They don't think they're going to need enough cooling and then they put plenty
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.860]  of cooling or they don't think about enough airflow.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.860]  You have to evacuate humidity out of there.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:47.860]  So those are things I spent more on AC units than they did on building.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.860]  I know that on the building. No, I know that place. Yeah, I know.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.860]  I know where you're at. Yeah, I know that place.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:54.860]  It's not one outfit in Colorado.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.860]  I'm sure that's true for a half dozen or more.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:57.860]  I just happen to know the one.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.860]  So the airflow is going to be a huge thing.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.860]  Also, you're going to be feeding on a much larger scale.
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.860]  Are you going to build a drip system? Are you going to be watering by hand?
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.860]  Every time you run that drip system,
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.860]  you're creating more humidity in the room that you're going to have to deal
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.860]  with. Every time you water by hand, there's going to be more humidity.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.860]  Do you have a drain? Do you have a floor drain?
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]  That's something I would definitely look for.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.860]  If you're moving into a new building, a floor drain,
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.860]  treating water is a huge deal.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:24.860]  Treating water. You're going to have, if you're moving into a warehouse.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.860]  At the, at the green and healthy warehouse,
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:29.860]  we used about a thousand gallons of water every other day ish.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.860]  You're going to need to treat that somehow.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.860]  I would recommend a really nice reverse osmosis machine because something I
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.860]  noticed was we were using the water. They came from the municipality.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.860]  More buckets and bubblers. Oh my gosh.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:47.860]  The scale is what we're getting at here guys is when you're talking about a
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:52.860]  basement grow, um, you're, you're talking about one employee.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.860]  You're talking about a thousand dollars worth of equipment, a little warehouse.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:00.860]  You multiply those numbers by a hundred. Right. Well, we were using, well,
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.860]  let me, let me get back into this part.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.860]  We were using the municipal water from Colorado Springs and as the temperature
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.860]  would change, the smell of the water would change.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.860]  I could smell chlorine in it on some days I could smell other things on some
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.860]  days and I would do a simple pH test and on some days the pH would be seven.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.860]  Some days it would be nine and it would just be days apart from that.
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.860]  And then I would do PPM tests and sometimes it'd be really high.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.860]  Sometimes it would be really, really low and we're feeding cocoa.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.860]  Our plants are in cocoa.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.860]  So it was really hard to predict what water you're going to get tomorrow or the
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.860]  next day or the next day.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:38.860]  So an RO machine would really be really helpful in a large grow.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:41.860]  That's something I would highly recommend because you're going to need clean
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:42.860]  water. You're going to need a lot of it.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:47.860]  Have more RO water than you think you're going to need available because if you
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:48.860]  get too much heat,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:52.860]  that's anywhere in the country guaranteed there's stuff in your municipal water
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.860]  that you do not want to feed to your plants and through your,
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.860]  your watering system, uh, bugs.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.860]  If you get a problem like bugs or powdery mildew, uh,
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.860]  you're going to have a larger problem than you have ever thought of having
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.860]  because hopefully you're running a perpetual growth.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:08.860]  You've got a large system and you're going to have plants that are in full
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.860]  flower at the end of flower. And you can't treat those for bugs.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:16.860]  So be highly prepared for pests and pathogens and powdery mildew.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.860]  Be on the lookout, be ahead of that. Uh,
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.860]  don't bring anybody into that grow unless it is absolutely necessary. Uh,
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.860]  it's you have to get clones from somewhere, but when clones come in,
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.860]  quarantine them, treat the shit out of them, almost kill them.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.860]  You're treating them so hard for pests and mold,
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.860]  because you don't want to bring any of that stuff in.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.860]  I know a lot of facilities that have just,
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.860]  they've given up trying to treat clones and they're seed only now. Wow. Um,
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.860]  I know a few outfits that have just given up entirely.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:46.860]  And I know a lot of home growers that are,
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:50.860]  that that's been their policies since the last time they got a gift clone.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:57.860]  Scheduling and getting everything on track in a big grow is a challenge in the
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.860]  beginning, unless you're a guy like myself, that is kind of OCD.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:03.860]  So you're going to need to get a good schedule happening.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.860]  You're going to need to get veg plants.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:07.860]  Then you're going to need flowering plants.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.860]  Then you're going to need clones and you're going to need to keep in mind that
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.860]  these flowering plants are going to be done in this amount of time.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.860]  And I need this many veg plants to replace them immediately because you do not
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:18.860]  want downtime.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:22.860]  And that's going to kind of segue me into something that I can really rant
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.860]  about personally.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.860]  The hugest caveat of going from the basement to a warehouse grow is often the
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.860]  relationship between the money person and the actual grower.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.860]  Or there's oftentimes there's a middleman.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.860]  You're going to have an investor.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.860]  You're going to have an owner and you're going to have a grower.
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.860]  I'm not sure which position you're planning on taking.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:45.860]  Please get all of those people on the same page because I see a lot of grows
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:51.860]  fail because an investor throws down money and he wants money back in fucking
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.860]  60 days because you're growing weed.
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:54.860]  Where's my money?
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:59.860]  And then you've got an owner that's rubbing his balls to keep him off you for
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.860]  a little while.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:01.860]  And he's like, give me 120 days.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:05.860]  And so now the owner will say, how long do you need to grow this crop?
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.860]  And I know that the crops that I'm trying to grow take me,
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:09.860]  I'm going to say 150 days.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.860]  This is hypothetical.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.860]  I need 150 days to make this crop happen.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.860]  The owner of that facility is going to look you dead in the face and go,
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.860]  cool, I'll see you in 120 days and it should be done.
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.860]  And now you're saying to yourself, these are fucking plants.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:23.860]  I can't cut 30 days off of this cycle.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:24.860]  There's no way it's going to happen.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.860]  So you've got an owner bitching or a investor bitching in an owner,
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:29.860]  an owner yelling at a grower,
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:32.860]  a grower that wants to do the absolute best he can for these plants because
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.860]  that's where the passion is.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.860]  But the owner has got to make money.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.860]  He's got to return the investment.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.860]  And then you've got an investor that only cares about the money.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:44.860]  So the hardest part of a commercial grow is getting all of your people on the
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:45.860]  same page.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.860]  You need your owner, your investor, your master grower.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.860]  Then you need whoever else you've got in there.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.860]  If you've got somebody working the bedroom and the flower room,
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.860]  those two people need to have a meeting every couple of days.
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.860]  If you've got a trim crew,
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.860]  your master grower and your assistant grower and your trim crew leader all
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.860]  need to communicate.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.860]  You need to know what plants are coming down.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:09.860]  You need to know how long you have to trim this until there's more plants so
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.860]  that you can schedule for the trimmers to be there.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.860]  Those are some of the things that you may overlook.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:17.860]  It's just so the scale and the scope are so much more complicated than
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:19.860]  a basement grow.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.860]  I mean, with a basement grow, you're getting ready to harvest.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:27.860]  You check out your plants every, every couple of days for a week.
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.860]  When they get to where you want them, you just start harvesting.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.860]  Maybe you call a buddy.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:35.860]  Maybe you make a little plan and have two friends coming over.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.860]  When you're talking about an industrial scale,
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.860]  you're talking about like 15 or 20 people that need to be scheduled,
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.860]  paid, W2, trained.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.860]  I believe two or three people could run.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:50.860]  One or two people can run a hundred light gross efficiently.
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.860]  Two or three people.
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.860]  Right.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.860]  But when it comes time to trim, then you need a small trim crew.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.860]  You need five or six people.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.860]  That's when you need that trim crew manager.
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.860]  Maybe that assistant grower now becomes also the trim crew manager,
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:06.860]  but you're going to need somebody that can delegate somebody that can manage.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.860]  You need a director that can direct the facility that can direct the
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.860]  employees that knows about the plants that knows about people that know.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.860]  And then you need, like I said in the last episode, a lawyer and an accountant.
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:16.860]  Yep.
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.860]  Those are some things that you're definitely going to need in a larger grow
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.860]  that you didn't think as much about in the other grow.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:27.860]  Also, shit goes wrong every day in a large scale grow.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:32.860]  Well, a lot of times investors don't necessarily know any of that,
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:37.860]  which is where a lot of headaches and a lot of partnerships break up is the
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.860]  money man doesn't know anything about marijuana.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:45.860]  And so he doesn't realize that something so simple is when we're doing trimmer
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:49.860]  interviews, we walked like a dude through the grow and we think he gave us thrips.
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.860]  And that's why this crop is a third smaller than it should be.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:02.860]  Like there's stuff that comes up because you're dealing with plant growth and
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:08.860]  you're dealing with a live plant in a medium where mistakes can mean millions
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.860]  in lost revenue or delays.
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.860]  We really can't get it out enough.
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.860]  The scope is so much different.
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:20.860]  The attitude and the skill sets are different.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.860]  One of the biggest traits for a basement grower is secrecy.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:27.860]  The ability to hide and stay hidden.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.860]  That keeps people with shotguns away from your door,
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.860]  whether they be law enforcement or rippers.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.860]  That's one of the biggest skill sets you can have as a basement grower.
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.860]  As a legal marijuana business owner,
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:44.860]  you need to be very out front loud and proud about what you do,
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.860]  how you do it.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:47.860]  And the fact that you love to follow the rules.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:52.860]  I love to follow the rules and I make sure all of my employees love to follow
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.860]  the rules needs to become your mantra and you need to get used to saying in
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.860]  front of TV cameras,
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.860]  especially if you want to be one of the first marijuana business owners in your
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:02.860]  area.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.860]  In Colorado, we have somebody that's known as a compliance officer.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.860]  And his only job is to make sure that you're following all of the rules.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.860]  He gets emails from here. We have the MED,
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.860]  the marijuana enforcement division.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.860]  He gets emails from them every day saying that, you know,
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:17.860]  that this is a new rule. This is a new rule.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.860]  And it's his job to go, whether it's the retail or the grow or the extraction
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:24.860]  facility, it's his job to get the employees together and say,
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:27.860]  this is the rule. And he has to oversee that that happens.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:32.860]  Rule changes like that are frequent here in Colorado and until
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:37.860]  nationwide, we really get legalization handed out or hammered out.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.860]  And there'll be common in your area too. So yeah, be ready.
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.860]  So I did in the past,
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:48.860]  I'm sure that we did an entire episode on going from a basement grow to a
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:51.860]  large scale grow. I'm pretty sure that we did an entire episode on that.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.860]  I will leave that in the show notes.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.860]  There'll be a link to that in the show notes, or if you go to the website,
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.860]  I read genetics, colorado.com and scroll through the shows.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.860]  I'm sure you'll be able to find it on there.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.860]  I cannot recall the episode number right now.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.860]  And I do not want to scroll through old episodes while we're recording.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:07.860]  So look for that.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.860]  It's a whole episode about moving from a basement grow to a large scale.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.860]  One of the things that we haven't really hit that you have available now
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:18.860]  that wasn't available to us when we started this is you,
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:24.860]  you can come to Colorado now and hire a consultant or go visit a couple of
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.860]  legal businesses and see how they do it.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:33.860]  And get an idea of what's going to be required of you and where you want to go.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:40.860]  And I know a number of people out here in Colorado have been hired to travel
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.860]  out to other States and help people navigate some of the things like
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.860]  planning out warehouse grows.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.860]  I mean, just the logistics that go into these things will blow your mind.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:53.860]  The amount of cooling that's required for a one story warehouse grow is
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.860]  typically greater than like a 30 story office building.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.860]  I mean, the amount of equipment that's necessary is just insane.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.860]  Learning how to maintain all of that equipment.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.860]  Like we're talking about pot growers.
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.860]  They know how to grow pot.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:11.860]  The amount of information that needs to be learned and adapted to is monumental.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.860]  That's something that I quickly learned is I'm not just a pot grower anymore.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.860]  I learned how to build drip systems with PVC.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.860]  I learned how to work on pumps.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:21.860]  I learned how to work on air conditioning.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:23.860]  I learned how to work on dehumidifiers.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.860]  Now I know how to work on the security camera system.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.860]  Now I know how to build shit that I never thought I would.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.860]  And it's just all because I went and helped with a giant commercial facility
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:32.860]  and I learned a ton of things.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.860]  Well, and it's, you need such a varied skillset because little things that
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:41.860]  don't have anything to do with growing marijuana can affect your legal ability
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.860]  to do so.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:48.860]  If you see a camera down in the grow and you ignore it, you might get hit with
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.860]  a compliance violation because that camera was down for an extra half day.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860]  And have your business shut down.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:56.860]  Quickly.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:57.860]  Quickly.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:58.860]  All right.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:27:59.860]  So he's got more parts to this question.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.860]  I don't want to harp on the one part for too long because the last episode got
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.860]  long that way.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860]  Did I just say harp on it?
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.860]  Jeez, how old am I getting?
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.860]  So he also said, I know you've recently made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:12.860]  Any advice on that transition?
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.860]  He also says, I'm planning on running Veg Bloom and I'm already in a basement,
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:19.860]  but do you add anything else to the Veg Bloom line as well?
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.860]  So that's kind of a multi-part question there.
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.860]  I've made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.860]  Any advice on that transition?
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.860]  Yes.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.860]  I use an easy cloner and I take my clones from the easy cloner and I put them
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:31.860]  into solo cups.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.860]  The solo cups have got holes in the bottom of them so that they can drain
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.860]  plenty of water and the water doesn't get stuck in there.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.860]  I usually fill the cups with an aerated soil, something like Fox Farms, either
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:43.860]  Ocean Forest or the Happy Frog.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.860]  And then I put the clones into there and then I water them.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:47.860]  With my desired nutrient solution.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.860]  I did so this time, but I used cocoa instead of the aerated soil and 50% of my
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:54.860]  clones died.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.860]  They fucking hated going into cocoa.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:58.860]  They were not happy about that.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:01.860]  The cocoa seems to have compressed and smothered them.
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:04.860]  They did not get a chance to get their legs and they got crushed and killed.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:08.860]  So my thought on that is put your clones into soil if that's what you're doing
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.860]  because they did not like the cocoa.
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.860]  Go into cups of dirt, put those cups of dirt into the cocoa in the future.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.860]  That's what I've learned because my plants were really, really pissed off.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:19.860]  You can go dirt clones to cocoa plants easy enough.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:21.860]  Oh yeah, they just drop right in there.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860]  They love it.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.860]  You just got to give it a time.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]  They don't mind the transition once those roots strengthen up a bit.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:28.860]  Right?
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:29.860]  Yeah.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.860]  Well, I know all the weight of the water in that cocoa compressed the cocoa
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.860]  real tight on those new roots and they just got crushed in there.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.860]  So that's one thing that I learned.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:39.860]  Also, you can water a whole heck of a lot more.
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.860]  More than you can water a whole lot of plants.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.860]  You can feed more frequently is what I think I'm trying to say.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:47.860]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:48.860]  You can't water a lot more.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:49.860]  You can feed a heck of a lot more.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.860]  When I was running soil, I would feed maybe twice a week.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:56.860]  Now, every time I am watering the plants, they are getting nutrients.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:00.860]  So three, maybe four times a week, these plants are getting nutrients and they
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.860]  don't show any signs of burn and they are growing vigorously.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:05.860]  Is that the cocoa not holding their newts as well?
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:07.860]  Right.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.860]  The cocoa, it doesn't hold on at all.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:10.860]  The nutrients just slide right out of there.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.860]  Yeah.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.860]  So then you don't get as much burn and you can feed more frequently.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:15.860]  It'll eat what it wants.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.860]  Better for your plants, but not your wallet.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:19.860]  Well, maybe in the end it'll pay for it.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:22.860]  I'm thinking if it's going to eat that much, there's going to be that much more
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:24.860]  weight that'll make up for it, which isn't a bad thing.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:26.860]  Time to do some math.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.860]  Something I'm thinking, I don't know if I'm convinced on 100% cocoa.
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:37.860]  I may start doing a 50% soilless mix, like a honestly not an expensive soil,
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.860]  something like Roots Organic or maybe even Tupper or the Fox Farm Ocean Forest
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:42.860]  wouldn't hurt my feelings.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.860]  A 50% mix with the soilless mix and cocoa.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:47.860]  Put the cocoa in there.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.860]  I know a couple of people that started doing that a while ago and they all
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.860]  seem to rave about it.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:54.860]  Yeah.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:55.860]  I'm going to try that next.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.860]  I'll run one light with the cocoa, one light with the soil, and then one light
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:00.860]  with the cocoa soil mix and we'll see what happens.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.860]  So that's something I feel about the soil to cocoa switch.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.860]  And also I've noticed if I overwater, they take really long to dry out and the
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:12.860]  plants will kind of slow down.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.860]  I thought that I could water the shit out of them with the cocoa, but I've
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:17.860]  noticed that I want some aeration in there.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:19.860]  If I overwater them, they really start to get stagnant.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:21.860]  Plants really like that aeration.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:23.860]  They do.
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:25.860]  They like air.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:27.860]  I've noticed that right when they start to dry out is when they really take off
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:29.860]  with the most explosive growth.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:31.860]  They're getting kind of dry.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.860]  I've only ever seen one good aeroponic system in motion and I was blown away.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.860]  With the students timelines.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.860]  The next part of his question, he said, I'm planning on running VegBloom.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:44.860]  And then he said, do you add anything else to their line as well?
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860]  Yes.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:49.860]  Actually, I've got a screenshot here of a conversation I had with a rep from
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:53.860]  VegBloom and he says, this is what we are recommended to use.
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:32:00.860]  He said four to five grams of base nutrient per gallon in veg, five grams
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:02.860]  per gallon in flour.
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:03.860]  You've got your base nutrient.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.860]  It's probably the HD or the RO or the dirty, whichever one they selected for
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:09.860]  you.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.860]  Hopefully you had a consultation with them and had your water checked out.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:13.860]  If you get your water tested, send them water test results.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:15.860]  They will recommend a base nutrient for you.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:20.860]  But four to five grams of base per veg or per gallon in veg, five grams per
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:22.860]  gallon in your flowering stage.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:26.860]  Then he says a half of gram per gallon of Plus Life once a week.
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:28.860]  And that's their rooting inoculate, the Plus Life.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.860]  I really like that stuff.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:36.860]  Half a gram per gallon of Plus Life once a week through veg and flour and then
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:38.860]  taper that off in late flower.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.860]  So like around week four or five, you can start pulling that back.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:45.860]  And then he says shine starting in week three.
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:50.860]  So at the beginning of week three, add shine, put one gram, one to two grams
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:52.860]  per gallon of water is what he says.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.860]  The shine starting in week three, one gram to two grams per gallon of water.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:01.860]  And then you can kind of increase that a little bit as time goes on from what
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.860]  I've seen.
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:04.860]  So week three, do a gram to two.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.860]  Week four, increase it a little bit.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:08.860]  Week five, increase it a little bit.
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860]  Six and seven, increase it a little bit and then start flushing from there.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.860]  And then he says push foliar feed every five to six days.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:18.860]  Honestly, I would cut out the push foliar feed, maybe spray it one time at
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:20.860]  the beginning of week five and then pull off of that.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:26.860]  And he says the push foliar to spray 50 milliliters per gallon of water.
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.860]  So maybe if you've got a small crop, just mix up a half gallon and put 25
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:32.860]  mils in there.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.860]  I also think that pH-ing that water before you spray it may help you, but be
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.860]  careful what you use to pH because you don't want to go killing off the live.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.860]  There's silic acid, there's calcium and there's sea kelp in there.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:46.860]  So be careful what you're using to adjust the pH.
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.860]  Also, you asked if I add anything to that mix.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.860]  Yes, I put a little bit of OSA-28 in there.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:55.860]  I like to add some potassium silicates to the mix.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:59.860]  I think that gives the plants more vigor and makes them a little bit more robust.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:05.860]  And then once a week, once every 10 days-ish, I'll hit them with either
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:10.860]  hybrics or carbo load just to speed up some carbohydrates in there, put a little
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.860]  bit of a boost in there.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:14.860]  So that's what I add to the Veg Bloom mix.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:17.860]  It's not too expensive that way and it is highly efficient.
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:19.860]  It'll put some shine on your plants.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:21.860]  It'll make them beefy.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:22.860]  They'll taste good.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.860]  They'll be high in THC.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.860]  They'll have quality flowers.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.860]  So that's what I add to the Veg Bloom.
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.860]  You also said you're already there in a basement.
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.860]  What else?
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:33.860]  What are some things you didn't expect going into such a large scale?
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.860]  Honestly, the demand.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:42.860]  I was expected to put out a specific amount of cannabis in a specific amount
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.860]  of time and I didn't know that there would be obstacles.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.860]  I didn't expect that there'd be a problem every day.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.860]  When you walk into a large commercial grow, when I would train new people, we
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.860]  trained a few new guys and they said, so what's the first thing we do when we get
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:55.860]  in here?
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:56.860]  Because everyone's excited.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:58.860]  The first thing we got to do is find what fucked up last night.
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:00.860]  And they're always like, what?
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:04.860]  And I was like, there's so many moving parts that something in here just broke.
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.860]  And it's funny how-
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:08.860]  And that's the size and scope thing I was hitting at earlier.
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:14.860]  It's in any grow, you need to keep an eye on the moving parts, your timers, your
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.860]  plugs, your pumps, your hoses, connections, all of it.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:21.860]  The bigger you grow, the more those equipment checks eat up into your time.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:28.860]  When you're talking about a hundred light or a 500 light massive warehouse, checking
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:32.860]  to make sure none of your drip system plugs have come loose and you're spraying
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:34.860]  water towards your ballast wall.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.860]  That takes half a day sometimes.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.860]  I spent honestly the first half of my shift when I would walk into the grow, the
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:45.860]  first hour would just be making sure that none of the cloners are clogged, none of
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.860]  the sprinkler system is clogged, none of the pumps are clogged, none of the breakers
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.860]  have flipped, all of the fans are on, all of the dehumidifiers are running and none
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:56.860]  of the filters were clogged up.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.860]  I would seriously spend an hour checking all of that equipment just like that.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:04.860]  I got a text message back from a buddy of mine maybe a month ago that read, can't
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:06.860]  talk, half the lights didn't come on this morning.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.860]  Ouch.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.860]  And it was just that two sentence way to let me know he can't talk right now and
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.860]  he's going to be busy all goddamn day.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.860]  He figures this shit out.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:16.860]  Yeah, I mean that's a game changer.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.860]  You've got a half million dollars and the fire's getting closer.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:21.860]  It's really neat in our industry.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:27.860]  We run multimillion dollar grow facilities that are responsible for, I'm not bragging,
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.860]  on Facebook, the owner of the facility I was growing for posted one time that I
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:38.860]  pulled 320 something and a fraction pounds of cannabis from 85 lights, which is
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:40.860]  three point something pounds per light.
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860]  I don't even remember where the hell I was headed with.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.860]  What was I saying?
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:48.860]  Okay, so there's that much product being grown, 300 and something pounds at
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:52.860]  somewhere between 18 and $2,200 a pound, approximately $2,000 a pound.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.860]  I had 300 of them times $2,000.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:01.860]  I produced that and we rely on like 10 and $12 timers that could fuck everything.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.860]  I find it really funny that we've got like this $8 timer from Lowe's that
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:07.860]  makes all of this get fed.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:10.860]  If that one timer fucks up, the whole facility does not get water for a day.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:16.860]  In a basement, your timer screws up, you don't notice it for three days.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:25.860]  One grower's out, you know, 6,000, 8,000, depending on how bad the problem got
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:27.860]  before it got found.
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.860]  Same thing happens in an industrial grow.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.860]  Someone's out several million and everybody getting fired.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:37.860]  Yeah, there's a whole dispensary that now has to go buy retail weed.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:40.860]  Well, no, and take this a step further.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:44.860]  There's 365 days in a year and a shitload of them are fucking holidays.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:46.860]  You want to be with your home, with your family.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.860]  Somebody's got to be at the grow every day to make sure all your lights went off.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:55.860]  When I started at Green and Healthy Wellness-
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860]  Pumps are spraying everywhere.
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.860]  I'm no longer there.
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:01.860]  I don't know if everybody listens to every episode, but I no longer work at
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.860]  Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860]  I'm pursuing my own endeavors right now.
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:11.860]  When I was at Green and Healthy Wellness, for the first crop, I did not take a day off.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.860]  The first harvest was we were in flower for nine or 10 weeks.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:18.860]  There were some strains.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.860]  The lemon gee went for 11 weeks.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:22.860]  Then there was a little bit of veg time before that.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:30.860]  I did not take a day off for 79 or 84-ish days because somebody had to be there.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:34.860]  That's something that I did not expect, but I was willing to do.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:40.860]  You can't be even tangentially involved with the legal industry before the lazy
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:42.860]  stoner stereotype evaporates.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.860]  The amount of work put in, the industrial grows.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.860]  The legal industry in Colorado, we did a billion in sales last year.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:53.860]  We're going to do 1.2 this year, maybe more.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:39:01.860]  The amount of days, 12, 15-hour days that people around the state put in to make
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:03.860]  that true is just astronomical.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.860]  Can I spend a billion dollars in my lifetime?
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.860]  I have to buy a country and people are running.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:10.860]  I could do it in six hours on Hash.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:12.860]  Okay.
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:14.860]  You could do it in four minutes on Drum Gear.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:16.860]  Can I come to that party?
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:18.860]  Yeah, imagine the drum kit I'd build.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:20.860]  Oh, man, I can't decide which color.
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:21.860]  Okay, all right.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:30.860]  When you make that step from gray market or the basement up into the legal industry,
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:36.860]  everything changes in ways that you can't predict or imagine.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:39.860]  You guys that are listening to this are lucky.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.860]  You know this is going in.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.860]  We learned this shit the hard way.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860]  Something I got to jump in and talk about, an ad.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:49.860]  Something I did not expect that was overwhelming, harvesting, drying, and curing.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.860]  I wasn't fucking prepared for that.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.860]  You need space for however much bud you've got growing.
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:57.860]  You need that much room for hanging buds, basically.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.860]  Because you can't just crush it all together because it's going to get funky.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:04.860]  You need a climate-controlled room for drying and curing that much.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:08.860]  That is something I totally did not plan properly for when I was at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:16.860]  I've seen people try to put a football field-size grow room into a bathroom-size drying area.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:18.860]  It's like, dude, you're not going to do it.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:19.860]  That air is going to get stuck in there.
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:21.860]  All the humidity is stuck in there.
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:23.860]  It's not going to go anywhere.
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:25.860]  You need somewhere for the freshly cut buds to be, for the older buds to be.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:30.860]  You need a drying and curing, hanging, trimming system that is sufficient for your space.
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:32.860]  Make sure you work on that.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.860]  The amount of...
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:41.860]  When you're doing any-size grow, the best thing you can do to ensure success is to plan up front.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:48.860]  When you're talking about the size and scope in the legal industry, that's astronomically important.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:57.860]  I've seen little oversights lead to multimillion-dollar fuck-ups and businesses collapsing.
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:04.860]  I mean, just silly, stupid decisions or little things that people overlook.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.860]  The cooling thing, I've seen multimillion-dollar grows sit idle half the year
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:16.860]  because there isn't physically enough cooling on-site to run during the hottest months of the year.
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:23.860]  The business just needs to make another 300 grand before they can buy an air conditioner big enough to cool their whole...
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:28.860]  Oh, man, that's like having a dope Ferrari or a rocket or a Tesla, but missing parts.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:30.860]  You just got to keep working.
[01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:35.860]  I've seen other grows just say, fuck it, and grow when it's way too hot and put out a super-airy product,
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.860]  and then they just have it all blasted into ash.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:40.860]  I'm so excited that the winter is coming. We get free air cooling.
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:42.860]  Just filter that air that comes in, you guys.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:47.860]  You don't want to bring in ice crystals and fungus from outside, but filter that air.
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:53.860]  The temperature swing and the giant concrete wall that you didn't think about once while you were planning
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:58.860]  causing massive powdery mildew and mold growth because of the temperature swing.
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.860]  I mean, how many people didn't see that coming in their original plans?
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:05.860]  And how do you heat a foot-and-a-half thick concrete wall?
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.860]  I moved into one house that had a basement with one concrete exterior wall,
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:12.860]  and the first time that I grew in that basement in the winter, guess what?
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:16.860]  White rhino plant, like a five-ounce plant. It looked like a frosted Christmas tree.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.860]  It got all funked up with powdery mildew. It went buh-bye.
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:24.860]  I watched another guy, what he thought were the best plants in the harvest.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:30.860]  When we finally got back to him, the section of wall that they were up against was ice cold.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:32.860]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:35.860]  And they were, I mean, it was the craziest looking pink mold I've ever seen.
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.860]  But I mean, just foulness.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.860]  And it was because of the temperature swing. When you multiply that, I mean,
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:44.860]  that was like maybe a $400 loss to that grower.
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:47.860]  But if that was in an industrial setting, it'd be $400,000.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.860]  Yeah, it would have just kept going right down that row.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:53.860]  All right, so those are a lot of things that you can look out for and you can expect.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:43:00.860]  He also said, any other advice you may think one would need knowing about taking a leap into the big leagues?
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.860]  Keep a positive attitude. Shit's gonna happen.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:06.860]  Like I said, every day you're gonna walk into that grow and you're gonna find some bullshit.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:09.860]  And you can either freak out, you can throw your arms up in the air and you can be like,
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:13.860]  ah, what the fuck happened in here? And you can kick some buckets and you can throw some shit around and make more of a mess.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.860]  Or you can go get the fucking mop. You can mop it up.
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:22.860]  Figure out where that pump broke. Go get some PVC pipe and a saw and fix all that shit that you gotta fix
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:24.860]  and just put some glue on it and hope it doesn't break again.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:27.860]  Because you still got work to do. Plants need to be grown.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.860]  Shit's gonna keep going. So that's what I can say. Keep a positive attitude. Keep your head up.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:36.860]  Also, pay attention. Make sure you're getting paid what you deserve to be paid.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.860]  And if there's some shit in the grow that can be done today, do it.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.860]  Don't wait until tomorrow. Just fucking do it.
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:47.860]  Never in the grow. I mean, little things that you can get away with at home.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:51.860]  I mean, sometimes for weeks at a time, you can get away with at home.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:53.860]  Do not fly in an industrial setting.
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.860]  There's just so much less room for error.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.860]  And things are gonna stack up. You're gonna think, I've got eight hours worth of work to do today.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:04.860]  I'll knock that out. I'll do eight hours worth of work tomorrow.
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.860]  While you're doing eight hours worth of work today, something's gonna fuck up.
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:10.860]  No one's prepared for the level of work at Harvest.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.860]  You're gonna have to go and clean up something.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:14.860]  And now you've got nine hours worth of work to do today.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.860]  So you're gonna say, I'm not gonna get this last part done. I'll do it tomorrow.
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.860]  Now, tomorrow you've got nine hours worth of work to do.
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:22.860]  Something else is gonna go wrong. Somebody's gonna interrupt you.
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:24.860]  Somebody's gonna call. A piece of equipment's gonna break.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:26.860]  You're gonna have to take a poop.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.860]  Something's gonna take a little extra time. You're gonna have to go to the store and pick up a part.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:32.860]  Now, your nine-hour day just turned into a 10-hour day,
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:35.860]  and you don't even get a lunch break, and now you're hungry and grouchy.
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:37.860]  And so when you go home and try to take care of your plants, they're gonna look like shit,
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.860]  and it's just gonna keep catching up with you.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:41.860]  So if there's some shit you can do today, do it today.
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:44.860]  Sweep that shit up. Spray whatever you gotta spray.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.860]  Clean up that dirt. Be looking out for pests.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:49.860]  Look out for mildew every day, and just be prepared.
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:51.860]  Get you some Method 7 so you don't go blind.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:52.860]  That's probably one of the best things I could say.
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:54.860]  Good sunglasses and sleep.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:57.860]  Yeah, some Method 7s. Keep your skin covered.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:44:59.860]  I think that covers a whole bunch, man.
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:01.860]  This guy asked a whole bunch of great stuff.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:05.860]  We basically gave you, like, the $5,000 console fee in an episode and a half.
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:09.860]  There you go. You can send donations to my email. No, I'm just kidding.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:11.860]  Man, I think that's all that we've got for you.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:13.860]  You said, I hope you can answer some questions.
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:15.860]  Well, I think we handled that for you.
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:19.860]  Yeah, if you want more information on any part of that, there was a lot of information,
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.860]  and I know this applies to a lot more than just the guy asking the questions.
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:26.860]  So feel free to shoot us further questions that the email Jeff keeps giving you.
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:28.860]  Yeah, everybody. I want to hear. I love generating.
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:30.860]  I love creating listener-generated content.
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:32.860]  That's how I know I'm giving you what you want.
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:34.860]  It's like you went to the restaurant and you ordered exactly what you wanted,
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.860]  and I was able to whip that up like the chef and bring it out to you and serve it hot.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:39.860]  It's super fresh for you.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.860]  So send me an email. GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:43.860]  It's really easy to get in touch with me.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:45.860]  I check that email very frequently.
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:47.860]  It goes to my phone. It jingles in my pocket when you send me an email.
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:48.860]  I like it. So send me a message.
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:50.860]  I would love to hear from you there.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:54.860]  Mike, tell everyone how they can find you on social media so that they can go stalk you.
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.860]  You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws,
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.860]  or on Twitter at at Nemo Punk 15.
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:03.860]  Nemo Punk 15. How'd you come up with that, bro?
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:05.860]  I've always been curious.
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:07.860]  No one. I've literally had it since 15.
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:09.860]  That's what the 15, since I was 15.
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:11.860]  That's where the 15 comes from.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:15.860]  Nemo is just no one, and I liked that when I was 15.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.860]  And then punk because I was 15 and I thought it was cute.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:19.860]  Because you were a little punk when you were 15?
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:23.860]  And then six years later, Finding Nemo comes out, and I was like,
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:25.860]  I just never got around to changing it.
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:27.860]  When I went to create a Twitter handle, it was like,
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:30.860]  do you want to use the Hotmail account you've had since you were 15?
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:32.860]  I clicked sure.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:34.860]  Why not? Let's do it.
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.860]  And now we're at 159 episodes in, and I'm stuck with it.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.860]  It works. Nemo Punk 15. Follow me, guys.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.860]  I am at GFYH Podcast on Twitter.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:44.860]  You can also find me at Rasta Jeff 420.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.860]  You guys, I just hit 8,000 followers on Instagram.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:49.860]  It'd be really cool if you follow me on Instagram.

[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:55.860]  I had an account. I was about 20,000, and they deleted me.
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:57.860]  They took me down, but you know what?
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.860]  I like it because now none of my, no, I can't say none,
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:02.860]  but my followers are not bots, and I'm not following a bunch of bullshit accounts.
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:04.860]  So I kind of got to refresh or restart.
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:06.860]  It's cleaner. I get more.
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:08.860]  I get more likes now than I did before.

[01:53:07.410 --> 01:53:14.130]  Big shout out to Kat and the entire mystic roots crew. I hope everybody's having a great week.
[01:53:14.130 --> 01:53:18.690]  I've had a fairly uneventful week. Let's talk about one thing that happened. I had to go to
[01:53:18.690 --> 01:53:21.810]  the hospital you guys had a little tiny don't don't even worry it's not that big a deal. I
[01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:27.170]  had a little tiny poke on my finger. So I had a little boo boo by my fingernail right right on my
[01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:32.290]  fingernail bed. And I worked in the garden. And I think from working in the garden, you guys I got
[01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:36.690]  an infection in my fingernail bed. Because I woke up one morning and my finger was a little bit
[01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:41.170]  swollen had a little little kind of a dot purple mark right there by my fingernails like that might
[01:53:41.170 --> 01:53:44.850]  begin infected. I'm gonna have to keep an eye on that. It's a little bit swollen. I went throughout
[01:53:44.850 --> 01:53:49.170]  the day by the end of the day it was fucking swollen. I woke up the next day and it was puffy
[01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:53.170]  it was huge you guys and it hurt like a son of a bitch but I had something I had to do. So I went
[01:53:53.170 --> 01:53:57.490]  did what I was doing that day and while I was doing it I bought my finger on a guardrail and
[01:53:57.490 --> 01:54:03.410]  when I hit it on the guardrail I'd let out a few really prime words. There were children around
[01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:08.290]  that should have not heard what I said but that was I was prompted to go to the hospital when I
[01:54:08.290 --> 01:54:14.210]  released those words. So I went to the hospital later that evening. It took them about less than
[01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:18.210]  an hour to deal with my situation. But I was in the hospital I was at the hospital for like
[01:54:18.210 --> 01:54:21.650]  probably three hours. So let me talk about what happened. I had a little tiny infection
[01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:28.210]  on my ring finger on my right hand on the right side of that finger on the fingernail bed. There
[01:54:28.210 --> 01:54:31.810]  was a little dot of something I was like that looks funky and then it swelled up and swelled
[01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:35.810]  up and swelled up and turned purple you guys it turned red and purple and it hurt like mother
[01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:39.490]  you could barely touch it without me screaming. So I went to the emergency room and like oh yeah
[01:54:39.490 --> 01:54:44.690]  you got a little booboo a little infection we can fix this. What they did they gave me a shot
[01:54:45.330 --> 01:54:50.930]  on the right side and the left side of my finger right between the first knuckle and like my hand
[01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:53.810]  you know like you get your first knuckle where your hand bends and then your knuckle where your
[01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:57.570]  finger bends. They gave me a shot between those two on either side and then that numbed up the
[01:54:57.570 --> 01:55:02.610]  whole finger. It numbed up my finger it numbed up most of my hand. Yeah it was pretty that that
[01:55:02.610 --> 01:55:06.770]  made all the pain was pretty much gone at that point. It hurt like a son of a bitch until then.
[01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:12.050]  And then once the numbing kicked in pretty good the doctor came back in and he took a scalpel
[01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:16.370]  and just cut a little tiny like a he made a plus sign just a little plus plus sign so that it would
[01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:21.570]  open up and then when he opened it you guys I could it was just like and so I made a little pop
[01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:25.090]  noise I don't know if the mic picked it up but it was a you could you could hear it and you could
[01:55:25.090 --> 01:55:30.370]  feel it and all kinds of shit came out of it and he squeezed a bunch of stuff out of it and uh oh
[01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:34.850]  he got so much stuff out of there but I could feel almost as soon as he cut it open I could feel
[01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:38.690]  relief. I could just feel the pressure just come off of my skin and off my finger I was like oh
[01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:44.850]  it felt so much better. So he stuck a bunch of gauze inside of there a bunch of wadding to suck
[01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:49.010]  up all the pus and goo that would be coming out of my finger and then he wrapped it up for a little
[01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:52.370]  bit or put some medicine on there and wrapped it up a little bit and he told me to change that in
[01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:57.890]  24 hours. So 24 hours later I had to take off the wrapping that he put on it and I had to pull
[01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:03.250]  that gauzey stuff out of my finger you guys that was one of the funkiest experiences ever there was
[01:56:03.250 --> 01:56:08.290]  a lot of shit tucked into my finger holy crap. So then I put more medicine on there actually JB
[01:56:08.290 --> 01:56:11.490]  helped me shout out to JB for helping me do that she put some medicine on my finger
[01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:17.490]  um and then I wrapped we wrapped it up again and uh been going about my business and I've
[01:56:17.490 --> 01:56:23.090]  been rewrapping it putting medicine on it about every 24 hours uh it's looking really good now
[01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:28.450]  today it's been uh let's see I'm gonna count days it's been four or five days and it's basically
[01:56:28.450 --> 01:56:33.250]  fine by now uh there's still a little bit of bit of scabbing on there it doesn't bleed anymore
[01:56:33.250 --> 01:56:37.330]  but they put me on these antibiotics you guys these antibiotics make me feel so terrible they
[01:56:37.330 --> 01:56:41.570]  make me nauseous as shit give me some stomach problems you don't want to be around when I take
[01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:46.930]  these things for like two hours after I take them I'm just miserable but I feel much better my finger
[01:56:46.930 --> 01:56:50.770]  doesn't hurt anymore I've only got a few more of the antibiotics to take this whole fucking
[01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:55.090]  situation will be over pretty soon so my guidance to you guys wear some rubber gloves when you're
[01:56:55.090 --> 01:56:59.090]  working in the garden or be sure to wash your hands really really well with some antibacterial
[01:56:59.090 --> 01:57:03.170]  soap because I didn't do either one of those apparently I don't wear gloves unless I'm
[01:57:03.170 --> 01:57:07.730]  getting into some shit that I know is going to be funky and I'm pretty sure that working in the
[01:57:07.730 --> 01:57:13.410]  gardens did not help with this infection I can't blame it on gardening but I'm like 95 sure that
[01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:18.530]  this funky shit under my fingernail came from working in the garden so wear some gloves cut
[01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:23.730]  your fingernails take care of your hands I'm usually I'm if you know me like I do have dreadlocks and I
[01:57:23.730 --> 01:57:29.170]  grow weed but I am kind of OCD I am kind of a clean dude I wash my hands constantly it's amazing
[01:57:29.170 --> 01:57:33.330]  that I'm the dude that got a fingernail infection so if it can happen to me it can happen to anybody
[01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:37.010]  you guys wash your hands wear some gloves that's my point sorry about rambling the finger's fine
[01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:39.890]  it's gonna be cool I told him at first just to cut it off because it hurts so bad I was like
[01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:43.730]  just cut it at the fucking knuckle man it hurts they laughed at me they gave me a couple shots
[01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:48.610]  they made it sound like these shots you guys they're like these shots really hurt so please
[01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:52.850]  keep your hand very still and the guy was like holding the doctor was holding my hand in place
[01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:56.690]  like please don't wiggle because I don't want to hurt you with this needle please stay still it's
[01:57:56.690 --> 01:58:01.010]  gonna hurt a lot when he stuck that needle in me I was like oh dude what why did you hype me up on
[01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:05.570]  how bad that was gonna hurt because it didn't fucking hurt like he had everybody had me more
[01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:09.810]  scared than anything it was kind of weird I was like why did you do that to me you just it barely
[01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:14.290]  poked and kind of burns it itched like I wanted to reach over and scratch it like I'm scratching
[01:58:14.290 --> 01:58:17.890]  my hand right now just thinking about the feeling all right you guys I'm gonna get to the point of
[01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:24.130]  this podcast there is a point I do have a purpose today um it is the season you guys it is harvest
[01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:28.770]  time um in Colorado most of California is probably working through their harvest but
[01:58:28.770 --> 01:58:34.130]  I got an email from a listener and he asked us oh this phone is trying to make me update right now
[01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:37.330]  and I don't want to update this is the worst timing ever here we go the iPhone wants me to
[01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:42.370]  update to the new operating system I'm not ready to do it so here we go let me find this email it
[01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:48.850]  says happy cropped over and he says happy cropped over Jeff then I'm gonna skip his name he says my
[01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:53.170]  name is blank and he says I'm a long time listener and have used so much of your information here
[01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:59.010]  legally in Michigan could you repost your curing episode I figured tis the season and I'm sure
[01:58:59.010 --> 01:59:05.090]  people could use a curing refresher I'm absolutely going to give you a curing refresher I'm not going
[01:59:05.090 --> 01:59:09.090]  to repost the old episode I feel like that would be cheap I'm just going to go ahead and redo a
[01:59:09.090 --> 01:59:14.210]  fresh episode on how to cure your freshly harvested buds before I get to that though
[01:59:14.210 --> 01:59:17.570]  uh there is a second half to this email that was kind of just written to me that I don't think
[01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:22.290]  needs to be read on the air I'll respond to the email personally but on the air let me say that
[01:59:22.290 --> 01:59:26.610]  I'm glad that I could be there to help you when things are rough and I truly appreciate the email
[01:59:26.610 --> 01:59:31.010]  like this and I'm sorry for your uh your troubles but I'm glad that I could be there to help you out
[01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:35.250]  the little bit that I could I appreciate that I love the email thank you so let's get to the point
[01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:39.570]  our friend asked us to do a drying and curing episode you guys my throat's already clogged up
[01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:43.330]  I feel like I could use a dab so I'm gonna press pause for one second I'm gonna sip on some frosty
[01:59:43.330 --> 01:59:47.650]  cold dr pepper and I'm gonna take a fat dab and when I get back we're gonna do a quick lesson
[01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:50.370]  on drying and curing your freshly harvested cannabis
[02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:12.590]  all right you guys I am freshly medicated I am freshly hydrated let's talk about drying and
[02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:16.990]  curing your freshly harvested cannabis I'm gonna back up a little bit I'm gonna go to something
[02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:21.310]  that is super important that I know I talk about a lot but I find it to be real important about
[02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:27.630]  14 10 to 14 days before you plan on harvesting your plants flush your plants it's free all you
[02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:32.910]  need is clean water you're watering your plants anyway or they're going to die so about two weeks
[02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:37.150]  before harvest time and if you can't predict it that well 10 days is cool but try to go 10 full
[02:00:37.150 --> 02:00:43.870]  days at minimum I'd rather go 10 to 14 14 is what I prefer but if you're in cocoa 10 days is plenty
[02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:50.110]  if you're in some soil soilless mix you're gonna want to go 14 days so what you got to do the first
[02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:55.070]  day that you decide to flush just fill that pot with get some if you really want to pH the water
[02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:59.230]  you can if you got a small crop pH it but if you're using a large crop like I run seven gallon
[02:00:59.230 --> 02:01:03.630]  pots so it takes a lot of water to flush my plants I don't pH all of that water to be on it to be
[02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:08.910]  honest with you to tell you the honest truth so what I do just fill up your reservoir and water
[02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:13.150]  your plant heavily a little more than usual to where you're getting a little extra runoff like
[02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:17.790]  if you've got saucers underneath your plants water until there's runoff in those saucers for sure
[02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:22.670]  like some extra more than usual because you're trying to wash that dirt out a little bit so for
[02:01:22.670 --> 02:01:28.510]  the next 10 to 14 days don't feed it anything but clean water just water if you want to pH it go
[02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:34.670]  ahead but just give it water clean those plants out that's going to make your plants burn better
[02:01:34.670 --> 02:01:39.710]  they're going to smoke better they'll taste better your ashes will be nice and white your joints will
[02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:44.430]  burn more smoothly have you ever gone to the dispensary and bought weed and he grinded up in
[02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:48.110]  the grinder and he started smoking it and your ashes burn and they're kind of black and the
[02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:52.910]  joint doesn't burn right and it tastes a little funky that's because that cannabis was probably
[02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:57.710]  not flushed properly and it's still got funky shit in it that you don't really want to smoke
[02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:02.350]  and it could have been a lot better had it been flushed it also probably could have been better
[02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:07.550]  had it been trimmed and cured dried and cured properly so we're going to get to that point
[02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:13.470]  so flush your plants it's free and it's so frustrating that people will spend so long on
[02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:19.390]  plants and then they don't flush properly you get 14 days of not having to spend money on nutrients
[02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:24.350]  and it's just water you're going to water anyway so water heavily let them dry out when they get
[02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:28.270]  a little bit dry you'll see them when the leaves start going warm you can see them do it all over
[02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:33.310]  again water the shit out of them and do that for the next 14 days let them water them dry them
[02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:39.470]  water them dry them you should be able to get at least four good flush cycles in there like the
[02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:45.310]  first day the big heavy one on the first day of the two-week cycle but maybe monday thursday monday
[02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:49.070]  and thursday that's four good waters that you can get in there and then i like to actually let the
[02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:54.110]  plants dry out a little bit before i harvest them so right before you harvest just kind of just let
[02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:59.310]  them chill out let them dry a little bit so flush your plants that's super important then a few days
[02:02:59.310 --> 02:03:04.270]  before harvest maybe two or three days before harvest i like to go in there and take off all
[02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:09.390]  of the large leaves the leaves that are just going to end up being thrown away or that are in the
[02:03:09.390 --> 02:03:13.470]  way if they've got a large petiole and i can get to them and they don't have resin on them i will
[02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:17.070]  cut those leaves off now while the plants are standing and they're healthy and those leaves are
[02:03:17.070 --> 02:03:24.750]  sticking out i cut all those leaves off this makes harvesting so much easier when it comes down to
[02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:29.230]  cutting down the entire plant they don't have all those leaves hanging in the way you've already
[02:03:29.230 --> 02:03:32.910]  gotten rid of them and you're a step ahead of yourself because harvest can get overwhelming
[02:03:33.630 --> 02:03:38.910]  if you've got one light if you've got four lights if you've got 10 lights it will get overwhelming
[02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:42.430]  even with that one light that one pound of weed is going to take you if it's your first harvest
[02:03:43.150 --> 02:03:47.470]  you're going to be sticky you're going to it's going to be overwhelming so cut off those extra
[02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:50.830]  leaves they're just going to be in the way they're going to end up on the floor the plants are going
[02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:55.790]  to be just fine without those leaves for a couple of days if you're one of the growers that does the
[02:03:55.790 --> 02:04:01.310]  extended dark period like 24 or 48 hours of darkness before harvest chop all these extra
[02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:05.470]  leaves off right before you do the dark phase and it will really increase what you're doing
[02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:10.430]  if you don't know what i'm talking about you guys a lot of people a lot of growers and this is up to
[02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:14.590]  you and it's up to your strain it's more up to the plants you're growing certain strains love it some
[02:04:14.590 --> 02:04:21.150]  strains fucking hate it so like blueberry and flow really love it some silver haze varietal i tried
[02:04:21.150 --> 02:04:25.390]  it with hated it lemon jeffrey doesn't seem to approve it so what a lot of people do they will
[02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:31.070]  take a plant and 24 to 48 hours before harvest they will put it in total darkness and let it
[02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:36.430]  sit in the darkness and this plant this puts the plant on panic mode and it basically makes it
[02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:40.590]  finish more quickly it'll kind of bulk up a little bit it'll start using the last of its energy
[02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:46.910]  what would you do if the sun didn't come up you would kind of freak out that plant's whole purpose
[02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:52.590]  in life is to reproduce that plant's goal is to get pollinated make seeds and die so that those
[02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:57.630]  seeds fall on the ground and grow again it just wants to reproduce what its job is to do that is
[02:04:57.630 --> 02:05:01.630]  to swell up to get bigger so that it can receive more pollen it's freaking out it's like i better
[02:05:01.630 --> 02:05:06.750]  get some pollen soon because i'm gonna die so it starts swelling up it starts getting bigger and
[02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:12.110]  you'll get a little more density and a little more resin production i'm not certain how true the resin
[02:05:12.110 --> 02:05:17.070]  production is but i've seen more density i've seen it happen if you put it in there for like 36 48
[02:05:17.070 --> 02:05:21.550]  hours you'll get a little production but it's strain dependent uh the more indica dominant
[02:05:21.550 --> 02:05:26.670]  strains will like this better so take off the big leaves you can throw in the dark if you want to
[02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:30.270]  that's up to you that's up to your plants it's up to your situation we can't do that in a large
[02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:34.430]  cultivation facility because we're running a perpetual grow and so we've just always got the
[02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:39.710]  12 12 happening because it's easier that way and i prefer the 12 12 over the 11 13 that we've talked
[02:05:39.710 --> 02:05:46.270]  about on the show we've talked about running your lights on uh 11 on and 13 off because it does show
[02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:52.990]  a little better phenotypical expression in a pheno hunt and it will also save you i guess if you're
[02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:58.270]  running for 63 days a nine week flower cycle that's 63 hours of lights that you're going to
[02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:05.230]  save that you don't have to pay for electricity cooling and also your gear doesn't get used that
[02:06:05.230 --> 02:06:09.950]  extra time so you're going to save that much mileage so if you want to do that that works too
[02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:14.190]  so let me get back to where we are take off the big leaves you don't want those in the way
[02:06:15.390 --> 02:06:20.670]  let the plants stay in the dark if you want to now it's time to harvest so if you have little
[02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:24.830]  plants you can chop down the whole thing if you have larger plants it's probably easier to cut it
[02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:31.790]  down in sections so what i do i honestly use a coat hanger and i will take a large plant and i
[02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:36.430]  will go from the top cola i will start from the top and work my way down and what i do i go from
[02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:42.670]  the top and i usually try to cut off about maybe uh somewhere between 8 and 12 inch long sections
[02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:48.030]  so i'll take the top cola and i'll go down to where i can find the first little uh branch of nodes that
[02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:54.430]  i think will support that and i cut below that to where i can use that branching as its own hanger
[02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:58.830]  i will cut the bud and then it will hang it upside down on the coat hanger that i plan to use and i
[02:06:58.830 --> 02:07:02.510]  hang that coat hanger somewhere else i've got a drying area that's got little racks for a coat
[02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:06.110]  hanger you can hang it wherever works best for you we'll talk about the temperature and the
[02:07:06.110 --> 02:07:10.910]  humidity here in just a few minutes so you cut your buds you hang them on a coat hanger you
[02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:15.070]  continue to work your way down the plant you've now you've got a couple of v's sticking off and
[02:07:15.070 --> 02:07:19.230]  you'll start seeing these little v's intersections they'll just come naturally go down the plant cut
[02:07:19.230 --> 02:07:23.310]  a couple of those so you chop one hang it up chop another one hang it up until you got your hanger
[02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:30.030]  full uh leave plenty of space on these hangers only put let's see one two three four maybe put
[02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:34.350]  like seven or eight maybe not a whole lot of stuff stuffed together on these hangers you want some
[02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:38.750]  airflow you want air to be able to get between your buds that's how they're going to dry properly
[02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:42.510]  so put them on those hangers and hang them somewhere now let's talk about where to hang
[02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:46.190]  the plants and then we're going to talk about wet trimming and dry trimming because that's what's
[02:07:46.190 --> 02:07:52.750]  next you want to ideally hang these plants in a room that is approximately 65 to 75 degrees
[02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:59.630]  you also want to have approximately 45 to 55 percent humidity in that room you may need an
[02:07:59.630 --> 02:08:05.070]  air conditioner you may need a heater you may need a dehumidifier or you may need a humidifier in
[02:08:05.070 --> 02:08:10.110]  there those are things that you may need to properly dry and cure this product to be top
[02:08:10.110 --> 02:08:17.070]  shelf 100 grade a dried and cured cannabis so you may need a dehumidifier if you're in Colorado
[02:08:17.070 --> 02:08:22.110]  you need a humidifier it gets so dry here so quickly that our buds dry in like four days
[02:08:22.110 --> 02:08:26.270]  people make fun of us they call our dispensary weed the Colorado crunch because it is crunchy
[02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:31.870]  by the time it gets to you it gets grown it gets trimmed up by a trim crew it gets dried and cured
[02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:36.830]  gets put in a bag it gets sent to a dispensary it gets put in a jar the jar gets open and closed
[02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:42.030]  all day every day and by the time it gets to you guys it is just super crunchy the way to prevent
[02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:46.910]  that is to dry it nice and slowly it will retain some of that moisture it'll retain some of that
[02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:52.190]  stickiness and it'll still be dense and flavorful and it'll still burn properly so you want your
[02:08:52.190 --> 02:09:00.030]  drying area to be 65 to 75 degrees 45 to 55 percent humidity we also need it dark in there you want
[02:09:00.030 --> 02:09:06.590]  it to be dark uh light degrades trichomes uh light breaks down thc light is not what you want you want
[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:11.710]  it dark in there also you would like to have a fan in there have some air circulation you don't
[02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:16.190]  want to leave that old air sitting on the buds you want to at least move the air around if you can
[02:09:16.190 --> 02:09:21.470]  have a blower blowing air out of the room and exchanging the air having fresh air coming in
[02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:26.110]  and old air going out that would be ideal i understand we don't all have that type of stuff
[02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:32.030]  so if you're using a closet or whatever make sure you open it the water that comes out of your buds
[02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:37.070]  is water that needs to go into that will go into the air and that's just going to be trapped in the
[02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:40.670]  closet you're just going to raise the humidity in your closet it's got to come out of there so open
[02:09:40.670 --> 02:09:44.750]  that door occasionally the more buds you have tucked in the space the more moisture there will
[02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:49.950]  be the more water you fed the plants right before harvest time the more moisture there will be so
[02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:54.190]  make sure you're getting rid of the moisture in that room also a good idea you guys would be a
[02:09:54.190 --> 02:09:59.230]  carbon filter if you can put a carbon filter and a blower in your drying area it would really help
[02:09:59.230 --> 02:10:04.430]  you out it would minimize the smell it would help keep you discreet a lot of people are going to
[02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:09.390]  make concentrates out of their buds so a carbon filter would also help you keep dust and contaminants
[02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:13.790]  out of the room one thing that i see a lot of people do they actually use the hut if you're
[02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:18.110]  growing in a hydro hut or a small room you can use that room as your drying and carrying space
[02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:21.390]  you should already have a blower in there you should already have climate controls in there
[02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:28.430]  i know people that have actually purchased specific three by three or five by five grow tents and they
[02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:32.510]  don't put a light in it but they do put the blower up top and they put a little fan in there
[02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:36.510]  and then they just hang the plants upside down in there so they've got one that's one hut that's
[02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:40.990]  being harvested all the time they've got a perpetual grow it's where like every two or four weeks one
[02:10:40.990 --> 02:10:45.470]  of their huts comes down and then it goes into that hut which is actually part of their flow
[02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:50.990]  it goes into this other hut which is their drying hut so those grow huts are good for that so you
[02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:55.550]  want a room that's very well controlled if you can i understand that's not always possible for
[02:10:55.550 --> 02:11:00.270]  everybody i said we would talk about wet trimming and dry trimming you've chopped on your plant
[02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:04.830]  you've got it on these coat hangers you've got it hanging up in a place now you can decide do i want
[02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:10.110]  to wet trim this stuff or do i want to dry trim it there are benefits to both uh you get super sticky
[02:11:10.110 --> 02:11:14.750]  it makes a hell of a mess and it takes a long time to wet trim i think wet trimming takes longer
[02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:20.510]  you may be able to do a little bit neater of a trim but in my opinion i am better at a dry trim
[02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:27.470]  and i think it's more time uh time efficient so wet trim uh take those buds that are hanging on
[02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:32.270]  the hanger take them off the hanger trim them up leave them on the hanger or leave them on the stick
[02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:35.710]  don't cut the buds off the stick just trim up all those leaves all those funky leaves that are
[02:11:35.710 --> 02:11:39.950]  sticking off trim them real close to the buds when they dry it's going to look even tighter those
[02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:43.870]  little little tiny pieces you can't get to those will sink into the bud those will disappear when
[02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:48.270]  it dries up you won't be able to tell they're there put them back on the hanger hang them up
[02:11:48.270 --> 02:11:54.910]  in your dry dry area and leave them there until the sticks snap now if you want to do a dry trim
[02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:59.470]  those plants that you've cut down and you've got them got them on the hanger just leave them in
[02:11:59.470 --> 02:12:04.590]  your drying area until the sticks snap and once the sticks snap that's when we catch up with your
[02:12:04.590 --> 02:12:09.150]  wet trim and dry trim so i keep saying when the sticks snap and i'm sure some people are saying
[02:12:09.150 --> 02:12:13.870]  what does that mean you've got your plants uh they've been cut down they're hanging upside down
[02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:18.430]  they've either been wet trimmed to where now you've just got beautiful branches with beautiful
[02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:24.030]  buds hanging off of them hanging on a hanger in your climate controlled area or you've got these
[02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:27.950]  furry looking plants with just the little leaves left on them because earlier at pre-harvest we
[02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:32.510]  cut off all the big leaves so you got these plants and they've just got little fuzzy leaves they need
[02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:38.030]  a haircut hanging off of those those are hanging up in your dry area now every about 12 hours i
[02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:42.910]  would recommend go to those plants and pick a branch and just give it a bend now at first you're
[02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:46.990]  going to feel those plants just bend they're real flexible they're not going to pop they're not
[02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:50.590]  going to break they're just going to bend and it's going to be real flexy it's not going to cause any
[02:12:50.590 --> 02:12:55.150]  problems over time you'll notice that those branches become a little more brittle and a
[02:12:55.150 --> 02:13:01.550]  little harder eventually those branches are going to snap when you bend them the thicker ones are
[02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:05.550]  going to take a little longer the thinner ones are going to go a little sooner so pay attention
[02:13:05.550 --> 02:13:10.270]  maybe check two or three buds every time you check uh when it gets close don't don't pay
[02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:14.190]  attention don't worry too much at the beginning but once you get closer start paying more attention
[02:13:14.190 --> 02:13:19.870]  to this different size buds and then once you feel those stems pop once you bend it and it goes click
[02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:24.670]  or pop or crunch you will know it when you feel it the first time you go that's what he meant
[02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:30.430]  that's when it is time if you've got trimmed buds that are already trimmed that's when it's time to
[02:13:30.430 --> 02:13:36.270]  pop those buds off of the sticks and we'll start the curing process there if you have got buds that
[02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:40.990]  were going to be dry trimmed now is the time to dry trim those and we'll talk about that a little
[02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:45.710]  bit all right dry trimming you've got your buds they're hanging on the hanger and they're a little
[02:13:45.710 --> 02:13:51.790]  bit furry so you just take a bud off that take a branch off the hanger and you can cut these buds
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:56.110]  off of the sticks because they are about to go into the curing bin so you don't have to worry
[02:13:56.110 --> 02:14:02.350]  about hanging them up anymore if the buds pop it is fine to take them off the stick yes so you've
[02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:06.990]  got your buds the stems pop you can take those down and if it's easier for you to trim it while
[02:14:06.990 --> 02:14:12.030]  it's on the stick go for it if it's easier for you to trim it after you cut it off the stick go
[02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:16.190]  for it in my opinion although i am not your trim boss this is for your garden if you're working for
[02:14:16.190 --> 02:14:20.030]  someone else you got to do it how they tell you follow their rules especially if they're paying
[02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:24.110]  you especially if they're getting you high follow their rules they're the they're the leader of that
[02:14:24.110 --> 02:14:28.110]  grow you got to adjust to their shit but check it out when they come to your house to help you grow
[02:14:28.110 --> 02:14:31.790]  you get to make the rules also so that's how it goes the leader of the grow gets to make the trim
[02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:36.670]  rules it's their product they get to make the rules one thing i have not mentioned almost this
[02:14:36.670 --> 02:14:41.070]  entire process wear rubber gloves i talked about that at the beginning of the show just wear rubber
[02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:44.430]  gloves all the time when you're in the garden put on rubber gloves you don't want that shit in your
[02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:49.550]  hands and the plants don't want your hands on them so just wear gloves so now you're wearing gloves
[02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:53.230]  and you cut your buds and they're cut off the sticks or they're on the sticks and they're fairly
[02:14:53.230 --> 02:14:59.390]  dry you can either use scissors or i use my thumbs you guys i will take basically a stick with buds
[02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:04.190]  on it and i will just take my thumb and kind of just twiddle my thumb around these buds i just
[02:15:04.190 --> 02:15:08.350]  make a little up and down motion and i knock the leaves right off the bud without disturbing the
[02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:12.990]  bud too much you'll catch on to what i mean once you do it a couple times just hold the bud almost
[02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:17.310]  like a video game controller now that i'm looking at my hands and use your thumbs just to knock off
[02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:22.270]  the leaves you'll find where the the perfect angle to use your thumb i have a little thumbnail in my
[02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:26.270]  right hand that i use so beautifully i can use it even through a glove just chop chop chop chop chop
[02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:30.030]  and the plants are fairly dry at this point and the leaves are already crispy because they've
[02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:34.990]  been hanging up for so long that you're just going ahead and knocking off those crispy leaves it'll
[02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:39.310]  be really easy if you need scissors get scissors and get in there and cut off all those funky
[02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:43.310]  leaves you'll be able to tell what needs to come off you guys you just want clean looking buds that
[02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:48.110]  aren't leafy please trim your buds you guys and you can save all if you're wet trimming or dry
[02:15:48.110 --> 02:15:53.470]  trimming you can save all of your material and you can make concentrates out of it if you i cannot
[02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:57.150]  recommend anybody to make their own bho if they're not experienced but if you know somebody
[02:15:57.150 --> 02:16:02.830]  that is a qualified expert at making butane honey oil you can make some bho if you want to make
[02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:06.750]  bubble hash out of it you can if you want to make edibles that's available if you want to make some
[02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:10.990]  topicals if you want to put it in coconut oil you can do all of that with your trim that is a
[02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:15.630]  possibility so you got your dry buds your dry trim in them with your thumb once those are dry once
[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:22.030]  those are all trimmed i feel like the buds that we dry wet trimmed earlier that we just cut off
[02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:27.790]  the sticks in the last part i talked about and these uh dry trimmed buds that we just trimmed
[02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:31.950]  with our thumbs i think we're at the same point with those in the same story so our two characters
[02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:37.550]  have caught up now you've got either way you've got a pile of beautifully trimmed and maybe you
[02:16:37.550 --> 02:16:42.590]  need to go back and hand trim uh those other buds that you did before also a little bit now that
[02:16:42.590 --> 02:16:45.950]  they've dried you may notice some stuff you missed you may need to go back and kind of clip them up
[02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:51.070]  a little bit get in there with some scissors either way you got a pile of beautifully trimmed
[02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:55.950]  perfectly grown buds right there just where the sticks snap it's perfect now this is where the
[02:16:55.950 --> 02:17:00.430]  curing process actually begins and i know we're 25 minutes into the episode but i wanted to get
[02:17:00.430 --> 02:17:04.670]  you here properly because you can't you can't get your black belt until you got all the belts in
[02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:09.550]  front of it so now we're going to talk about curing this perfectly dried and trimmed cannabis
[02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:14.510]  all right you guys i am not a scientist i hope that's obvious i have not referred to any notes
[02:17:14.510 --> 02:17:19.790]  in this whole episode and i'm not going to pull up any notes to uh actually tell you this part about
[02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:25.550]  why we want to cure our cannabis here's basically my understanding of why uh curing slowly is
[02:17:25.550 --> 02:17:30.030]  important chlorophyll tastes like shit that's basically the main part there's another reason
[02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:34.190]  to it also but mainly chlorophyll tastes like crap chlorophyll is a part of your plants that
[02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:39.150]  makes them green we want to get rid of as much chlorophyll as we can from the buds we don't want
[02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:44.670]  to smoke that so the only way that you can get rid of chlorophyll the only way it can evaporate is by
[02:17:44.670 --> 02:17:49.470]  evaporating with moisture moisture is the only way it can go away but it's got to break down
[02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:54.590]  before it can evaporate with moisture so it's got to happen slowly and that's why we try to cure
[02:17:54.590 --> 02:18:03.070]  slowly also another thing that happens is the thc transfers uh from or it changes for it transforms
[02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:09.790]  from thc to thca is my understanding and by dropping a water molecule which is what happens
[02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:14.750]  when the water slowly evaporates it becomes much more psychoactive and much more available to us
[02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:20.270]  when we smoke it now if i said that wrong i would love to hear your correction because that is just
[02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:26.830]  off the top of my head and that is my uh my little mental library of science of why we cure cannabis
[02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:31.390]  mainly the reason i cure cannabis because it makes it taste better it makes it burn better
[02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:37.550]  and it gets me higher and it just makes it better overall so if you want a basic reason or a science
[02:18:37.550 --> 02:18:43.630]  reason that is why we want to cure our cannabis properly and slowly so you've got your flush phase
[02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:47.310]  done you've got your pre-harvest done where you chopped off all those extra leaves then we cut
[02:18:47.310 --> 02:18:51.390]  down the plants and then we either wet trimmed them or we cut off all the leaves and now they're
[02:18:51.390 --> 02:18:55.790]  hanging up they're pretty or we dry trimmed them uh which we let them hang for a while and they
[02:18:55.790 --> 02:19:00.510]  looked ugly as shit and then when the stems cracked but the buds were not brittle you still want those
[02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:04.350]  buds nice and moist so they're fluffy and sticky you guys that's what we're aiming for fluffy and
[02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:08.830]  sticky buds that's that's right what we're aiming for so you got those cleaned up and now we've got
[02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:14.030]  these pile or this pile of beautiful whatever you grew you got this beautiful pile of lemon
[02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:21.070]  jeffrey it's perfectly trimmed it's sticky it's fluffy the stems were popping beautifully now
[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:26.110]  here's what we're gonna do we're gonna get some glass jars you want like either cur or ball
[02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:33.310]  glass jars i like the larger ones with the wide mouth i like those a lot i like to put just gently
[02:19:33.310 --> 02:19:37.390]  drop the buds into the jar don't pack them in there just drop buds into the jar let them sit
[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:42.590]  on their own fill it up about 75 to 90 percent of the way you don't want to stuff them in there
[02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:48.110]  you don't want it only halfway full you want it like 75 to 90 percent of the way full then you
[02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:53.230]  want to put the lid on that jar and repeat put all your buds in jars just keep going until you're out
[02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:57.710]  hopefully you have a lot of jars hopefully you get tired of filling jars with weed that's my
[02:19:57.710 --> 02:20:04.430]  goal for you so fill all your jars with buds then put those jars in a cool dry dark place
[02:20:04.430 --> 02:20:08.430]  hopefully the same environment similar to the environment that we had the buds in while they
[02:20:08.430 --> 02:20:12.750]  were drying i know they're in a jar but we still want to keep them cool and dry and we want to keep
[02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:16.670]  them dark they're still doing their thing there's still science happening in there so we want to
[02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:22.350]  keep them dark now i'm kind of weird and i have a lot of time to dedicate to my buds in my projects
[02:20:22.350 --> 02:20:28.430]  you may not be able to do this this will this is adjustable okay i like to go back about two hours
[02:20:28.430 --> 02:20:33.310]  later and open that jar for just a couple of minutes you know like maybe five minutes i want
[02:20:33.310 --> 02:20:38.510]  the air to move around in that jar just let it fluff around and then i close it up and then i'll
[02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:43.550]  come back about four hours later and do it again and then before i go to bed i will actually dump
[02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:48.430]  out all of the buds out of the jar and i will rearrange them and i'll put them back in the jar
[02:20:48.430 --> 02:20:51.790]  and i'll leave the jar open for like a good i don't know three or four or four or five minutes
[02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:56.910]  because i want i want fresh air around that i want anything that like any stagnant spot where they've
[02:20:56.910 --> 02:21:00.350]  been pressed together where they've been sweating on each other i want to give them some breathing
[02:21:00.350 --> 02:21:05.630]  room i don't want any mold to happen inside that jar is what i'm getting at so i'll crack it open
[02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:10.110]  at like two hours and then four hours and then six hours and then maybe eight hours and then i'll try
[02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:13.630]  to go to bed for a few hours and ignore it but the first thing you know i'm gonna do when i wake up
[02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:18.030]  is go crack open those jars and smell them and at first they're gonna smell wet they're gonna smell
[02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:23.070]  like damp weed if you're getting like a hay smell or an ammonia smell you done fucked up it's gonna
[02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:27.790]  be hard to fix that you left it closed for too long or you put it in there too early so pay attention
[02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:32.750]  you don't want it super wet if it's super wet leave it open a little longer let some of that
[02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:39.070]  water come out or open it more frequently you do not want mold starting in there so open up the jar
[02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:46.350]  like i'm weird so four hours six hours eight hours 12 hours and then start the more it dries the more
[02:21:46.350 --> 02:21:51.310]  slowly the more less frequently you can open it but you want to be opening that jar once or twice
[02:21:51.310 --> 02:21:56.350]  a day we call it burping the jar so you want to burp that jar once or twice every day and then
[02:21:56.510 --> 02:22:02.430]  after about five to seven days you're going to notice the buds are dry but they're still spongy
[02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:06.750]  you'll squeeze them and they'll kind of compress and then they'll fluff back up and then you'll
[02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:11.550]  break them open in the middle there'll be a little bit of moisture still but they'll smell real dank
[02:22:11.550 --> 02:22:16.030]  they'll have a really good smell and when you smoke it it's gonna burn beautifully and then
[02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:19.790]  keep doing that just lock them into that jar and leave it in there and only open it once a day
[02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:23.150]  after the first week you know what i mean once they're getting where they're smokable just leave
[02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:28.110]  them in there and only open that jar once a day i recommend that you take out if you think you're
[02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:31.950]  gonna smoke that'd be ridiculous maybe you're gonna smoke seven grams of weed a day pull out
[02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:35.950]  seven grams for yourself put that in your head stash jar and leave the rest in the cure jar so
[02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:40.590]  that you just leave it sealed up and then every day or other day go pull out how much you're gonna
[02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:43.870]  smoke for the next couple days and leave the rest of that stuff in there to cure and it's going to
[02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:50.430]  be a lot better so you got your buds they're they're still damp but they're dry you know what
[02:22:50.430 --> 02:22:55.710]  i mean you want plenty of moisture in there but you don't want them too moist if they're juicy you
[02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:59.230]  don't want to put them in there so when they're kind of as soon as those stems pop you should be
[02:22:59.230 --> 02:23:04.910]  cool put them in the jar seal that jar up put it in a dark place and then every just increase your
[02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:09.950]  time frame and pay attention to those if you've got multiple jars experiment open one up every
[02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:14.430]  four hours and see what it's like and then leave a couple of them closed and then but don't go too
[02:23:14.430 --> 02:23:18.510]  long with it you don't ever want to go like right away i would say check them every four to six
[02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:23.150]  hours in the beginning and then increase that time until you can go every 12. it's going to be up to
[02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:28.510]  you to judge how often your jars need to be open and i'm trying to give you time frames but i don't
[02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:31.790]  want it i don't want you to mess up your buds because if you have different temperatures if
[02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:38.670]  you have different humidity problems if you may if you leave it closed too long you may cause a mildew
[02:23:38.670 --> 02:23:45.230]  issue so it's an art every art there's some trial and error try not to fuck up and try not to make
[02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:49.950]  errors that's my best advice to you pay attention don't be afraid to mess up a little bit but don't
[02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:53.790]  mess up a whole bunch you got to mess up once or twice you didn't learn how to ride that bike really
[02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:59.310]  cool until you crashed a couple times and then you learned what you could do so that's my my quick
[02:23:59.310 --> 02:24:04.990]  crash course on how to dry and cure your cannabis i feel like once your cannabis is properly dried
[02:24:04.990 --> 02:24:09.950]  and cured it can be stored for i don't i've had some weed for three to six months before i've
[02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:14.030]  stored weed for a year before if you keep it in the proper conditions in the proper environment
[02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:18.350]  different strains will keep for a different amount of times um i've had some stuff that i
[02:24:18.350 --> 02:24:23.870]  kept in a refrigerator in the back for a very long time it was okay i remember a long time ago i hid
[02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:27.630]  some weed for myself in a freezer and i forgot about it and i found it when i moved out of that
[02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:32.430]  house that weed tasted really terrible putting it in the freezer did something weird to it i don't
[02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:36.750]  know what went wrong like i said a little bit ago i gave a disclaimer i'm not a scientist i'm just a

[02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:31.990]  long time to get it in stock it took like three weeks to order that thing it was kind of pricey
[02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:35.910]  you know it wasn't the cheapest costume anybody's ever bought but it was well worth it because i've
[02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:40.470]  had it for i think i've had it for four or five years and i wear it every other year and every
[02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:46.630]  year i win at least one costume contest in it so it is paid for itself at the elevate party i won a

[02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:45.590]  not be a fix it was based on crowd applause and it was clear that they liked my costume so big

[02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:48.390]  anybody would recognize me by so you won't find me on there i'm also in a bunch of facebook groups
[02:39:48.390 --> 02:39:54.390]  but i've uh i've had to check out of a bunch of the facebook groups because honestly i see so
[02:39:55.430 --> 02:39:58.550]  i apologize for all the throat clearing you guys i was taking some fat dabs of some live
[02:39:58.550 --> 02:40:01.910]  resonance just got me all clogged up but we'll deal with it we'll get through a podcast it'll
[02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:06.230]  quit right about the time the show ends i see a bunch of bullshit in facebook groups you guys
[02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:10.630]  i see people recommending the shittiest advice and then i go look at the person that gave that
[02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:14.390]  advice i look at their pictures of their grow and i can see why their girl looks the way it does
[02:40:14.390 --> 02:40:18.630]  and why they're giving the advice that they are giving they're not qualified and it kind of
[02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:24.710]  frustrates me so i had to leave a bunch of facebook groups i'm not in a lot of them um i but i do go
[02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:29.670]  troll around and browse around the forums so i see what's going on and lately a topic i've seen more
[02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:35.190]  than once or twice is people were talking about ways to determine flowering times of new seeds
[02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:39.670]  and new clones that they've gotten that they don't have any information on maybe somebody got some
[02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:44.070]  bag seed and they don't know how long to let that bag seed flower or maybe somebody was gifted a
[02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:48.070]  clone and they don't know anything about the clone from the friend that gave it to them so they were
[02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:53.830]  like hey rasta jeff how do i determine how long to let these plants flower so that i don't fuck
[02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:57.350]  up my crop so you guys i'm gonna get some water here and fix up my throat you know i'm gonna take
[02:40:57.350 --> 02:41:01.510]  a couple more dabs and then after that we're gonna talk about how to determine flowering time of new
[02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:07.990]  cultivars let me clear my throat all right you guys i am back i promised we would talk about ways to
[02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:13.270]  determine flowering time of new cultivars so maybe you got some seeds and you don't know how
[02:41:13.270 --> 02:41:17.270]  long those seeds are supposed to take maybe you maybe you had a bunch of packs of seeds and these
[02:41:17.270 --> 02:41:21.270]  got mixed up or mislabeled or weren't labeled at all or maybe they came out of a bag maybe you've
[02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:25.110]  got seeds that you're running you have no idea what they are you're gonna need to know how long
[02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:29.910]  to let those plants flower maybe your buddy gave you clones maybe you bought clones at the dispensary
[02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:34.310]  maybe you cut clones and you don't know which clone that is you need to determine how long to
[02:41:34.310 --> 02:41:40.630]  let that plant flower so obviously the way to the easiest way to do that would to be flower that
[02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:46.310]  plant out and then around week seven or eight maybe eight or nine i have to say about week seven get
[02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:52.150]  in there and start looking at that plant with a loop or a magnifier of some sort of a magnifying
[02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:58.470]  glass some sort of an eye you need at least a 60 to 100 times magnifying glass to look at these
[02:41:58.470 --> 02:42:03.990]  plants you want to see the trichomes that are on your buds and look in a few different places on
[02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:10.150]  the plant don't just look in one spot so what i use hooks up to my computer i've got a let me see
[02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:15.270]  i can go right here on my computer it'll remind me the brand it's from dynoscope i've got a dynoscope
[02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:19.030]  a little it's a scope that hooks up it's a magnifying scope that hooks up it's a usb
[02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:23.350]  port goes right into my computer it works with a mac it works with a windows machine i use it
[02:42:23.350 --> 02:42:26.950]  on a mac so i promise it works it was a bitch to get it started but once i downloaded the driver
[02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:31.670]  and got it working it works beautifully every time now i can take screenshots of what i'm seeing
[02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:38.230]  uh but this little scope i basically i can take i take my chair because it rolls and has wheels
[02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:42.150]  and i put the macbook on the chair because i'm clumsy and i like to drop shit so i leave the
[02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:46.790]  macbook on the chair and i roll it around and then i use the scope it's got a nice long cord
[02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:50.710]  and then i use that scope to go find the spots that i want on the plant and then i look at the
[02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:57.030]  screen and i can see if the trichomes are amber or if the trichomes are clear or if they're milky
[02:42:57.030 --> 02:43:02.390]  or if they're busted ruptured open and got shit dripping out of them i can see that clearly with
[02:43:02.390 --> 02:43:08.550]  the scope i've got i can see bug shit if there's bug shit in my plants i can see any insect in the
[02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:12.390]  world with this scope that i've got so i like to pull a leaf off randomly and look at the underside
[02:43:12.390 --> 02:43:17.270]  of the leaf and see what's going on look for eggs looks for bugs look for bug shit look for signs of
[02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:24.790]  bugs so what you need if you can't get that type of a thing for your computer uh they sell the 420
[02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:29.750]  scope is okay i think they call it the dope scope or the 420 scope that's okay there's one sold at
[02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:34.790]  the growth store uh that is made by hydra farm which is the one that i like i have the 100x
[02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:40.070]  little scope it takes a double a battery at fault it may take two batteries but it folds uh it folds
[02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:44.150]  together real nicely when you unfold it it lights up and then you can see through it real well
[02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:48.390]  uh that one i really like but get yourself a scope so that you can look at the trichomes
[02:43:48.390 --> 02:43:53.990]  at least 60x 100x magnification is better uh it's the most obvious way to tell when plants are done
[02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:59.030]  when within your view you're probably going to see a certain amount of trichomes it's going to
[02:43:59.030 --> 02:44:04.870]  be hard to count them but you want about 25 to 30 percent of those 20 to 30 percent of those you want
[02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:09.190]  them turning amber you want it to kind of look like the color like maybe you dipped them in dr
[02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:14.790]  pepper or maybe they got a little they're just you could see it it turns the amber orangish color
[02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:20.310]  they'll start off clear then they'll get milky and then they get like a silvery color and then
[02:44:20.310 --> 02:44:24.710]  from silver that's when they start turning amber and when 30 percent of your trichomes are amber
[02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:29.910]  that's usually when you want to harvest most strains so it's kind of up to you you can go a
[02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:34.950]  little early you can go a little late it's not that huge of a deal a lot of people way over stress
[02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:40.870]  the harvest window in a production facility we say this string gets this many days and then we're
[02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:45.430]  cutting it the fuck down because we have another crop coming up right behind it so and the weed
[02:44:45.430 --> 02:44:51.190]  comes out pretty fabulous in most of the production facilities and we just pick something like 60 days
[02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:56.550]  or 70 days i like to say 63 days because that's nine full weeks of flower and most of the strains
[02:44:56.550 --> 02:45:02.390]  we're running nowadays nine weeks is perfect but let's talk a little more because this scope uh
[02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:07.670]  the looking at the trichomes is really going to help you out but you're going to need to know a
[02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:13.990]  little earlier in the game when to harvest because you're going to need to flush your plants about 10
[02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:19.990]  to 14 days before you start cutting down i heavily stress flushing your plants it's free and you've
[02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:25.830]  got to water the plants anyway so why not just pour a bunch of water in there and clean the plants out
[02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:31.430]  so let's talk about some ways to determine how long those plants are going to take
[02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:36.790]  you need to figure out how indica or sativa dominant those plants are and a huge indicator
[02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:44.870]  of that is leaf shape and size if your leaf has really long slender fingers it's probably sativa
[02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:49.670]  dominant and you're going to lead more toward the nine to ten week range maybe even longer
[02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:57.190]  if your plants have big fat broad leaves if they're real wide if the the wider the leaf probably the
[02:45:57.190 --> 02:46:01.430]  shorter the flowering period is something that i've learned that's not always true but it's
[02:46:01.430 --> 02:46:06.150]  usually a good thing to follow so if you've got good wide leaves you're looking at eight to nine
[02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:13.030]  weeks now if you've got a eight or nine week plant the first time you run it i recommend going
[02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:17.830]  nine weeks why not try that extra week to see what happens you may get more bulk right at the end you
[02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:23.350]  may get more resin right at the end it may harden up it may do a lot of good shit in that last one
[02:46:23.350 --> 02:46:27.830]  week so let that happen it's not going to over ripen too much but it don't worry about a little
[02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:30.950]  over ripening it's not that huge of a game especially if it's your first time that's
[02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:35.590]  something i wrote down that i wanted to wait a little while to mention but this is hopefully
[02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:40.390]  not your last time running this strain this is your first time running this strain which means
[02:46:40.390 --> 02:46:45.190]  you can fuck it up because you have another time and another time and another time after that to
[02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:49.430]  run it hopefully if this is a good genetic a good cultivar and you can keep it around you're going
[02:46:49.430 --> 02:46:53.670]  to be running it a bunch of times so this is just your test run this is your first date you'll be
[02:46:53.670 --> 02:47:01.030]  okay so uh leaf size and leaf shape will give you a big hint on how long those plants are going to
[02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:04.790]  take if you've got an eight or nine week plant like i just said like the eight or nine week indica
[02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:08.870]  let it go nine weeks because you want it to go to full maturity if you've got a plant with long
[02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:12.790]  skinny leaves that's a nine to ten week plant i would recommend letting that plant go 10 weeks
[02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:17.510]  the first time why not you want to see what the potential of that plant is a lot of those sativa
[02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:21.670]  plants really do magical shit toward the end of their growth phase or at the end of their flowering
[02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:27.190]  phase they bulk up they resin up they really put on some flavor they get better at the end they're
[02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:31.030]  probably swelling up because they want to be bred to and you're not giving them any pollen so they're
[02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:35.030]  just getting bigger and bigger and stickier and fatter so sometimes it's better to let those
[02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:41.430]  sativa strains go longer i like an 11 week sativa it doesn't scare me to run a 77 day sativa dominant
[02:47:41.430 --> 02:47:46.230]  plant flower it when it's real short be ready to have some sticks and supports available and get
[02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:51.030]  that sucker going don't be afraid to grow something that takes 77 days or even maybe a little bit
[02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:55.670]  longer it's well worth it you're going to get more potency you usually get more weight and everybody
[02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:59.750]  loves that good sativa buzz and it's harder to find everyone's growing those shorter indicas
[02:48:00.310 --> 02:48:04.150]  so if you're growing a heady sativa you're going to stand out from the crowd medical users are
[02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:07.670]  going to appreciate it they're going to want more recreational users are going to love it they're
[02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:13.350]  going to want more so that's going to help everybody out so the basic leaf size is a good indicator of
[02:48:13.350 --> 02:48:16.870]  how long your strain may take from the very beginning if it's real broad you're looking at
[02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:21.590]  eight to nine weeks if you got some skinny leaves go nine or ten weeks maybe even a little bit
[02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:27.030]  longer the thing is if you start flushing a little bit too early that's okay if you start flushing
[02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:31.190]  too late that's when you start overdoing things you'll be okay so if you've got these plants that
[02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:35.830]  are going to end up taking 13 or 14 weeks and you've already started flushing to be prepared
[02:48:35.830 --> 02:48:39.590]  for week 11 you'll be okay they're just going to start looking a little ragged they're going to
[02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:44.710]  turn a little bit yellow but they'll keep going if you're growing a really long sativa something
[02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:48.950]  that i should mention if you're a new grower and you're growing a long sativa longer than 11 weeks
[02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:55.030]  you will be lucky if by the end of that grow that plant has any big leaves left those plants like
[02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:59.350]  to they're they're finicky and they will lose a lot of leaves they'll look like shit but you'll
[02:48:59.350 --> 02:49:04.230]  have amazing medicine still because they're hardy and a plant that goes that long is meant to survive
[02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:09.110]  a lot of experienced growers have a lot a hard time with a longer flowering plant because the
[02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:13.830]  feeding regimen is kind of confusing you're not sure when to phase certain nutrients out and when
[02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:18.710]  to phase certain nutrients in because everything happens at a different time than what we're all
[02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:23.110]  taught about these nine week plants everybody all the nutrient companies that sell you stuff most of
[02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:27.350]  the stuff you see online when they're recommending feeding they're basing that on about an eight to
[02:49:27.350 --> 02:49:31.590]  nine week flowering phase and most of them don't even give you enough time to flush most tell you
[02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:35.270]  to flush for one week because they want you to keep pumping fucking product into your plants
[02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:40.790]  so my point to all this is that you can't really over flush so be be prepared to flush flush like
[02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:45.670]  normal and if the plants look like they want longer let them go longer you can tell if they
[02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:49.190]  want to go longer by using the scope that's pretty much the only way you can get in there and tell
[02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:54.070]  also something that will give you a hint of how long the plants are going to take
[02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:59.750]  is the basic structure structure my words are hard to say today i apologize the basic structure of
[02:49:59.750 --> 02:50:05.510]  your plants how uh how tall they get how quickly how much they branch out how bushy the plant is
[02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:10.470]  is it growing straight up if that plant's going straight up and not making a lot of side branches
[02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:15.110]  you've probably got yourself a sativa dominant plant that's going to take a little longer to
[02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:19.830]  flower it's just going to keep going straight up if you've got a plant that is growing really long
[02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:25.110]  lanky branches and it's just going really really fast that plant may take a little longer to flower
[02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:30.150]  if your plant is staying short and stocky and real squatty and just getting wider and wider as it
[02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:35.030]  grows you've probably got an indica dominant plant which is also you're going to have to put that
[02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:40.070]  trait together with your leaf size and kind of put those two together and let those two things kind
[02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:43.990]  of give you hints of how much indica and how much sativa are in those plants and how long you should
[02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:48.550]  let them go if you've got seeds and the breeder pack says that they're done in eight to nine weeks
[02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:53.190]  i recommend you let them go nine weeks uh maybe even let them go a little bit longer if you can
[02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:57.270]  i like to let stuff go i'm kind of weird i let i like things to go nine ten or eleven weeks just
[02:50:57.270 --> 02:51:02.950]  because i it's easier to remember i know a lot of strains that i run 63 days is perfect for most of
[02:51:02.950 --> 02:51:09.190]  them all right you guys so that is basically ways to figure out flowering times of new seeds and
[02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:13.990]  new clones that you've got uh check the trichomes if you've got a scope if you can hook your scope
[02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:19.910]  up to your computer i recommend you check in three places check at the top of the plant that big top
[02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:24.230]  bud check that one check in the middle of the plant so you know how you got the top and if you
[02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:28.550]  didn't do any topping you got a top and then there's buds that come up right underneath that
[02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:33.110]  the next part of the crown the next part of the bouquet check some of those check like right
[02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:37.350]  around that ring there and then go down a little bit further in the plant and check down there
[02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:41.590]  and see how the difference is going you may be really amber down at the bottom you may be really
[02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:47.510]  clear at the top i like to harvest when about 30 percent of the total trichomes have started to show
[02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:51.590]  amber so it kind of looks like you got a little bit of dr pepper on them or a little bit of root
[02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:55.670]  beer or something and they're just starting to turn a little bit brownish if you wait too long
[02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:59.350]  they all start turning that color i feel like they kind of the plants lose their flavor
[02:51:59.350 --> 02:52:02.390]  you can cut them a little bit earlier they're going to taste better here's here's part of the
[02:52:02.390 --> 02:52:06.550]  deal you cut them sooner they taste better you cut them a little bit later they probably get
[02:52:06.550 --> 02:52:11.030]  heavier and more potent so that's that's something you want to balance on yourself
[02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:15.590]  most people are focused on getting as much as they can from each light or each square foot or each
[02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:19.590]  square meter or each table however you're growing nowadays and however you're doing the measurement
[02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:24.230]  for your own business plan so most people want to let it go that extra few days and add on that
[02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:29.190]  extra bulk and i mean you can they just get more potent in my opinion as you let them go so guys
[02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:34.790]  that's mostly ways to uh kind of predetermine how long to let your plants flower all right you guys
[02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:39.590]  i wrote down a couple more notes that i want to talk about that i was inspired to rant on because
[02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:43.590]  of this topic but before i get that far i need a dab i don't need a dab it makes me sound weird
[02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:48.070]  when i say that i need a dab i felt weird i would love to take a dab with you guys so if you were in
[02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:54.150]  a safe place where you can smoke uh start getting a dab ready i'm taking the lid off of some golden
[02:52:54.150 --> 02:53:00.870]  goat shatter from tr concentrate uh this golden goat shatter is amazing there's very little left
[02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:06.550]  because i really like it i keep uh i keep coming up to the to the table where the email is and i'm
[02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:10.230]  like i'm gonna take a little dab of that golden goat and i just get a little dab of it and i take
[02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:14.150]  a dab and i get the flavor on my mouth but i take just such a little dab that it doesn't really get
[02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:17.590]  me high because i take a lot of dabs you guys i take a lot of big dabs so i'll be like shit i'm
[02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:20.550]  gonna take another little dab i'll take another little dab and after like two or three of those
[02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:23.750]  i'll be like you know what fuck it i'm just gonna take a big dab and i'll take a big dab that i
[02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:28.070]  should have just started with and then i end up really high it's funny i like it so this gram
[02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:33.110]  of golden goat shatter has not lasted very long at all good job to whoever grew the material and
[02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:39.270]  then a really good job to our friends at tr concentrates this came out wonderfully it is
[02:53:39.270 --> 02:53:44.230]  just straight shatter i talk about different consistencies of hash this is like a little
[02:53:44.230 --> 02:53:49.190]  pane of glass wrapped in parchment it's not that sharp because it's more like jolly ranchers
[02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:53.750]  it's like if you had a sheet of jolly rancher it would just be snappy like this i'm trying to fold
[02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:58.230]  it back up so that i can put this away all right i've got the hash onto the dabber i've got the
[02:53:58.230 --> 02:54:04.310]  hash put away putting it back in my child proof child safe container i just like keeping it in
[02:54:04.310 --> 02:54:09.670]  that container because it's labeled i got a couple of the flavors over here all right so we got me a
[02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:16.150]  dab i'm gonna heat up the nail right now i'm smoking on a quartz banger uh so let's talk about
[02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:19.590]  some different nails a lot of times you see me using the email if you've ever watched me on
[02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:23.350]  instagram it's a nail it's made out of titanium and it's got a cord attached to it and actually
[02:54:23.350 --> 02:54:28.070]  attaches to a box and that box keeps the nail at the appropriate temperature for taking dabs all
[02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:33.270]  the time i'm not using that right now it is right here next to me it's turned on but i want to use
[02:54:33.270 --> 02:54:39.430]  this rig that i was uh that i won so i've got a quartz banger it kind of looks like a normal bowl
[02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:46.630]  like a pipe bowl or it's so it's basically just a little dish it's a quartz dish uh it's pinky deep
[02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:52.390]  it looks like a thimble it's almost like a thimble you guys but it's quartz and uh so it's
[02:54:52.390 --> 02:54:55.750]  quartz it's got of course it's got a little piece that goes into the rig and it goes into the rig
[02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:59.830]  just kind of like where a bong bowl would go and then of course i'm using the rig i won from
[02:54:59.830 --> 02:55:04.630]  elevate it's a pumpkin looking rig so with a little pumpkin on the back which is the coolest part
[02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:08.550]  so i'm gonna hit the banger it's gonna be hard to hear me probably while i do that
[02:55:08.550 --> 02:55:11.350]  i got a lot of compression going on here but i don't think it'll cut this out
[02:55:12.550 --> 02:55:17.670]  but while i heat it make sure you check out the dank team.com they've got a fresh drop of
[02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:23.670]  iRI genetics in stock so make sure you check them out for feminized and regular cannabis seeds needs
[02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:26.630]  all right you guys here in just a couple of seconds i'm gonna take a dab of this golden goat
[02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:30.230]  and then we'll get on with this podcast i do appreciate you dabbing with me i hope you're
[02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:33.910]  heating the nail right now my nail has got to cool because i just way overheated it it's kind
[02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:38.790]  of cleaning off some funk so i'll let the nail cool all right you guys let's dab together
[02:55:41.810 --> 02:55:43.810]  here we go feels cool let's do this
[02:55:43.890 --> 02:56:03.790]  that's a pretty big dab maybe bigger than i needed for a podcast but what could go wrong
[02:56:03.790 --> 02:56:05.630]  right i just got to sit here and talk into a microphone
[02:56:07.310 --> 02:56:12.830]  oh yeah yes excellent work to my friends at tr concentrates this golden goat shatter
[02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:18.510]  is amaze balls i approve all right my head will quit spinning here in just a couple of seconds
[02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:22.190]  and we're going to move on with the parts that i wrote down glad i wrote them down because i would
[02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:26.510]  have forgotten by now all right so i'm gonna take a little bit of this gold and go to the
[02:56:26.510 --> 02:56:30.270]  i would have forgotten by now i'll take one last drink here and then we'll get on with this
[02:56:30.270 --> 02:56:34.110]  guys i hope you took a fat dab with me if you're dabbing with me while we're on while you're
[02:56:34.110 --> 02:56:38.990]  listening to the show send me a tweet let me know what you're smoking on tweet me at gfyh podcast
[02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:44.190]  on twitter at gfyh podcast i'd love to know that you're smoking with me and i'd love to know what
[02:56:44.190 --> 02:56:50.510]  you're smoking on all right so let's get to the notes that i wrote down i wrote down that phenotype
[02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:57.070]  variations will take different times to flower which means if you buy a package of seeds not
[02:56:57.070 --> 02:57:02.430]  every seed in that package is going to take the same amount of time to flower you may get one
[02:57:02.430 --> 02:57:07.790]  strain that takes or one phenotype that takes nine weeks and you may get one phenotype that
[02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:12.750]  takes 10 weeks to flower out of the same package now the reason for that i'll explain a little bit
[02:57:12.750 --> 02:57:20.270]  why that comes to do when i talk about f1 and f2 breeding and f3 and f4 when you make an f1
[02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:27.630]  it's got a very wide variety of traits it'll bring out traits from the mother plant and the father
[02:57:27.630 --> 02:57:31.630]  plant that were used the female and the males so the girl plant that received the pollen and the
[02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:38.190]  male plant that threw pollen those traits are going to show but also the grandparents so whatever
[02:57:38.190 --> 02:57:44.110]  female you used the male and female used for that are going to show up in your f1s and whatever
[02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:50.270]  you used for the male the male and female used to make that is gonna show up in your f1 seeds so
[02:57:50.270 --> 02:57:55.710]  you're gonna see grandma you're gonna see grandpa and then you're also gonna see grandma and grandpa
[02:57:55.710 --> 02:58:00.350]  on the other side and then you're also gonna see mommy and you're also gonna see daddy so you're
[02:58:00.350 --> 02:58:05.790]  gonna have a lot of different phenotypes popping up from some f1s this is a possibility so you may
[02:58:05.790 --> 02:58:11.030]  get one that takes eight weeks. You may get one that takes 10 weeks, and this is very
[02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:16.550]  possible. So when you make those F1s, there's a lot of variation. So what we do as breeders,
[02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:23.110]  we find the most desirable female that you can find out of all of your seeds, out of
[02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:26.870]  the F1s. You want the one that is whatever you're looking for, the best stink or the
[02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:30.970]  best growth or the best resin. You want the best all around girl. And then you want to
[02:58:30.970 --> 02:58:36.390]  take pollen from the male from the same generation and throw that pollen onto that girl. And
[02:58:36.390 --> 02:58:41.530]  the seeds that come from there will be called F2. F2s will be a little bit more stabilized,
[02:58:41.530 --> 02:58:46.330]  meaning you're not going to see as much representation of the grandparents pop up in the seeds, but
[02:58:46.330 --> 02:58:49.450]  you're going to see a little bit closer to the mommy and daddy. And you're going to start
[02:58:49.450 --> 02:58:55.130]  narrowing it down a little bit more closely to what you're trying to make with that seed
[02:58:55.130 --> 02:59:01.090]  line. Something interesting that happens with an F2 cross is called transgressive segregation.
[02:59:01.090 --> 02:59:09.750]  You actually see the kids outperform the parents is generally what happens. It'll also go the
[02:59:09.750 --> 02:59:14.850]  other way also. You'll see weaker traits also, but we call those as breeders, hopefully.
[02:59:14.850 --> 02:59:21.570]  So you'll see if you put a gigantic male and a gigantic female, and the male makes super
[02:59:21.570 --> 02:59:26.650]  stank and the female makes super resin, you put them together, you just may make the super
[02:59:26.650 --> 02:59:31.290]  Hulk on your F2s because you're going to see that transgressive segregation come through
[02:59:31.290 --> 02:59:37.770]  mostly in the F2 generation is where I find that. So then I would find my favorite F2,
[02:59:37.770 --> 02:59:42.090]  the best looking girl of that F2 that's got the traits I'm going after. Hopefully it was
[02:59:42.090 --> 02:59:45.370]  very similar to the F1s. You know what I mean? You found the one that looks like you were
[02:59:45.370 --> 02:59:48.610]  going after, and then you go find another one that looks like that, that's an F2 or
[02:59:48.610 --> 02:59:52.370]  that's improved. And then you hit it with the pollen from the F2 male. Now you have
[02:59:52.370 --> 02:59:57.330]  to find a male and a female, and then you hit the female with the male pollen. And when
[02:59:57.330 --> 03:00:01.570]  those seeds come out, you've now made F3. Now what I'm getting at is every time you
[03:00:01.570 --> 03:00:06.170]  do that, if you do it correctly, sometimes you have to go back. You got to keep a bag
[03:00:06.170 --> 03:00:09.850]  of seeds from the old ones that go back and re-hunt. But if you do it correctly, when
[03:00:09.850 --> 03:00:14.610]  you go through each time, you're going to make that strain more stable and more stable.
[03:00:14.610 --> 03:00:18.290]  So you'll start off with like five different phenotypes and you breed it again. And now
[03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:22.770]  hopefully you just worked it down to like three solid phenotypes and then you breed
[03:00:22.770 --> 03:00:27.810]  it again. And then you got two solid phenotypes to where when you grow these plants, you're
[03:00:27.810 --> 03:00:30.890]  50, 50 going to get this one or this one. You know what I mean? That's what it's going
[03:00:30.890 --> 03:00:35.290]  to be kind of like. And then hopefully you can breed it down to where by the time you
[03:00:35.290 --> 03:00:40.490]  get to F5, which takes a long time, you guys, that is years of breeding and years of developing
[03:00:40.490 --> 03:00:44.610]  because you got to find the males and the females. And then sometimes you don't find
[03:00:44.610 --> 03:00:48.610]  what you're looking for. So you finish a crop and you just start over. And I actually searched
[03:00:48.610 --> 03:00:54.970]  through I'd say 250 seeds to find an arise male. And I threw away a good portion of the
[03:00:54.970 --> 03:00:59.450]  females that popped up because it wasn't what I needed at the time. So by the time you get
[03:00:59.450 --> 03:01:04.370]  to F5, you'll be growing out these seeds and they will look like clones if you do it correctly.
[03:01:04.370 --> 03:01:10.090]  Five or six. I think F5 is about where they'll come out really close. F6 will look like clones.
[03:01:10.690 --> 03:01:13.970]  But I wouldn't want to take it that far because then nobody else could breed to it. It would
[03:01:13.970 --> 03:01:17.730]  just be whatever you bred to it would come out looking like that all the time. It'd just
[03:01:17.730 --> 03:01:22.410]  be real dominant genes. So every time you breed to it, if you do it correctly, it makes
[03:01:22.410 --> 03:01:26.970]  it more stable. So what I'm getting at is a lot of the breeders on the market right
[03:01:26.970 --> 03:01:34.350]  now are selling you F1s, which is not a bad thing. I appreciate it. Gage Green sells F1s.
[03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:38.650]  And one of my favorite brands to buy is Gage Green Genetics because I love the variation
[03:01:38.650 --> 03:01:42.530]  that comes in the F1. I get to see a lot of neat stuff. I actually had the honor of
[03:01:42.530 --> 03:01:46.490]  being a tester for Gage Green. So I got to see a lot of great shit come out of their
[03:01:46.490 --> 03:01:51.930]  garden. I got to test a lot of great seeds. I love F1s because of that. So you may get
[03:01:51.930 --> 03:01:56.330]  an F1 that takes eight weeks. You may get an F1 that takes nine weeks from the same
[03:01:56.330 --> 03:01:59.930]  exact pack of seeds. Now you've got a decision to make. Do you want to cut that one down
[03:01:59.930 --> 03:02:03.570]  early and change your feeding regimen and have two different plants that you've got
[03:02:03.570 --> 03:02:10.810]  to feed? Or do you just want to let them all go 60 days, 64 days, 56 days? It's up
[03:02:10.810 --> 03:02:14.610]  to you. You get to decide that stuff, but that's a decision you've got to make. If you
[03:02:14.610 --> 03:02:19.690]  can tell early on in flower that one is kind of taken off and getting a little bit taller
[03:02:19.690 --> 03:02:23.190]  than the others, I mean, you may have some thinking to do right at the beginning there.
[03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:28.570]  That may give you a hint. So different seeds are the same seed pack, different phenotypes.
[03:02:28.570 --> 03:02:32.270]  You may have different flowering times. I really love searching through seed packs and
[03:02:32.270 --> 03:02:36.030]  finding the phenotypes because depending on what you're working with, you may find
[03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:40.070]  some really great shit. You may also find some ridiculous stuff. But in the same pack,
[03:02:40.070 --> 03:02:44.830]  I found completely purple buds that were short and compact and plants make purple, bright
[03:02:44.830 --> 03:02:51.190]  purple buds. And then I've also had plants that make tall, velvety, bright green buds
[03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:54.830]  and I couldn't decide which phenotype to keep. So I kept them both and I called them just
[03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:59.550]  different phenotypes. So pheno hunting is fun. I really love it. That's one of my favorite
[03:02:59.550 --> 03:03:05.350]  things to do. So expect some variation. Also, something I wrote down is different flowering
[03:03:05.350 --> 03:03:11.710]  times in different rooms and environments. So if I gave you clones, if I gave you clones
[03:03:11.710 --> 03:03:14.790]  and I gave one of your other friends clones and I gave a couple other guys clones and
[03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:22.010]  you guys all took it to your grow room, you may see that your room wants these plants
[03:03:22.010 --> 03:03:28.350]  to flower in 58 days. They may be perfectly finished in 58 days. If I give somebody else
[03:03:28.350 --> 03:03:34.030]  they may need 63 days if we're getting right down to it. So environmental can have a lot
[03:03:34.030 --> 03:03:39.950]  to do with it. You guys also indoors and outdoors, you're going to see huge differences in different
[03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:43.990]  areas. Our buds are going to look completely different if we're growing them in California.
[03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:48.530]  If we're growing them in Colorado, altitudes make a huge difference. Environmental factors
[03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:53.830]  like that will play a huge difference in your flowering times. Yeah. All right. I think
[03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:57.070]  I've gone on for long enough. You guys, we're at 32 minutes now. So I think I'm going to
[03:03:57.070 --> 03:04:00.350]  wrap up the recording. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for listening to this long
[03:04:00.350 --> 03:04:03.350]  of an episode of just me ranting. It feels like I'm talking for a long time when I do
[03:04:03.350 --> 03:04:07.870]  a 30 minute episode by myself. So I truly appreciate you guys hanging on for it. If
[03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:10.790]  you've got anything you'd like me to talk about on the podcast, I would love to hear
