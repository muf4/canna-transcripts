[00:28.110 --> 00:30.550]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.550 --> 00:32.510]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:32.510 --> 00:35.190]  who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.190 --> 00:38.070]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.070 --> 00:39.910]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.910 --> 00:41.790]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.790 --> 00:43.910]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.910 --> 00:45.510]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.510 --> 00:47.950]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.

[01:00.150 --> 01:02.230]  regular or feminized cannabis seeds,

[01:12.490 --> 01:14.470]  and a lot of other brands that you know and trust.
[01:14.510 --> 01:15.870]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're looking to add

[01:18.950 --> 01:23.950]  regular or feminized, I highly recommend thedankteam.com.
[01:24.550 --> 01:26.310]  All right, now that the ads are out of the way,
[01:26.310 --> 01:28.430]  let's talk a little bit about what I'm dabbing on.
[01:28.430 --> 01:30.990]  Just a minute ago, I took a giant dab of some,
[01:30.990 --> 01:32.550]  it's called True Kush.
[01:32.550 --> 01:35.550]  It was a super kush flavor, it was delicious.
[01:35.550 --> 01:38.030]  But now I am dabbing on some Bordello.
[01:38.030 --> 01:40.470]  The Bordello has a really, I don't know,
[01:40.470 --> 01:43.270]  kind of a cheesy, fruity sort of a thing to it.
[01:43.270 --> 01:44.510]  It doesn't get me super head high,
[01:44.510 --> 01:46.630]  but it really makes my body feel nice.
[01:46.630 --> 01:47.790]  So a big shout out to our friends at
[01:47.790 --> 01:51.990]  Concentrate Supply Company for the quality dabs.
[01:51.990 --> 01:53.510]  You guys, let me know what you're dabbing on.
[01:53.510 --> 01:55.050]  I always wanna know what people are smoking with me.
[01:55.050 --> 01:56.830]  I get to tell you guys what I'm dabbing on.
[01:56.830 --> 01:59.470]  I wanna know what you're smoking, what you're consuming.
[01:59.470 --> 02:00.790]  Let me know where you're located,
[02:00.790 --> 02:03.110]  that way I know if you're in a legal or a non-legal state,
[02:03.110 --> 02:05.510]  a medical or a recreational state.
[02:05.510 --> 02:07.550]  Let me know what you're smoking and how you're smoking it.
[02:07.550 --> 02:09.790]  Are you smoking a joint, are you smoking a dab?
[02:09.790 --> 02:12.270]  Are you smoking an indica, are you smoking a sativa?
[02:12.270 --> 02:14.870]  Are you smoking some Jack Flash,
[02:14.870 --> 02:16.370]  are you smoking some OG Kush?
[02:16.370 --> 02:18.910]  Let me know what you got going on in your location.
[02:18.910 --> 02:20.790]  I always like to know what other people are smoking.
[02:20.790 --> 02:24.350]  You can tweet me, simply send a tweet to at GFYH podcast,
[02:24.350 --> 02:28.790]  or send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:29.830 --> 02:31.350]  All right, you guys, I wanna start off the podcast
[02:31.350 --> 02:33.870]  by giving everybody a huge thank you
[02:33.870 --> 02:36.190]  for the huge response to episode number 250.
[02:36.190 --> 02:38.630]  I have gotten so many emails, so many tweets,
[02:38.630 --> 02:42.210]  so many Facebook messages, so much Instagram interaction.
[02:43.050 --> 02:43.890]  I'm a little bit overwhelmed,
[02:43.890 --> 02:45.290]  I'm trying to catch up to all of the messages,
[02:45.290 --> 02:48.530]  but huge thank you to everybody that listened to episode 250.
[02:48.530 --> 02:50.770]  Thanks to everybody that retweeted the episode,
[02:50.770 --> 02:52.370]  that has shared the episode.
[02:52.370 --> 02:54.290]  Thanks to everybody that has left iTunes comments
[02:54.290 --> 02:55.450]  and iTunes reviews.
[02:55.450 --> 02:58.670]  I truly appreciate all of the interaction.
[02:58.670 --> 03:01.030]  Also, while I'm thanking people, I owe Mike a huge thanks.
[03:01.030 --> 03:03.770]  Dude, Mike, thanks for coming and being on episode number 250
[03:03.770 --> 03:05.770]  you're a great contribution to the show,
[03:05.770 --> 03:07.250]  and it looks like people are missing you
[03:07.250 --> 03:09.150]  because we got a lot of tweets about having you back.
[03:09.150 --> 03:11.750]  So dude, thanks for coming and being on the podcast.
[03:12.270 --> 03:14.470]  I'll look for more episodes with Mike coming up pretty soon.
[03:14.470 --> 03:15.830]  He brings a new energy to the show
[03:15.830 --> 03:17.070]  and it keeps it moving a little better
[03:17.070 --> 03:18.870]  than just me here by myself.
[03:18.870 --> 03:20.910]  So yeah, look forward to more of Mike coming on the show.
[03:20.910 --> 03:22.090]  Mike, you're invited, bro.
[03:22.090 --> 03:24.950]  Put some podcasts together, come do a show with me.
[03:24.950 --> 03:29.190]  All right, on episode 250, I did a little bit of a contest.
[03:29.190 --> 03:31.910]  I've been doing Throwback Thursday episodes.
[03:31.910 --> 03:33.590]  I've been putting some really creative music
[03:33.590 --> 03:34.430]  at the beginning of those.
[03:34.430 --> 03:36.030]  That's just me killing time with my computer here
[03:36.030 --> 03:37.750]  when I'm waiting for something else.
[03:37.750 --> 03:40.030]  But in some of that creative intro music,
[03:40.030 --> 03:42.630]  I think it's episode number 248,
[03:42.630 --> 03:43.830]  there is a voice and it says,
[03:43.830 --> 03:45.870]  oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[03:45.870 --> 03:47.950]  In episode 250, I offered a prize
[03:47.950 --> 03:50.750]  to anybody who can identify that voice.
[03:50.750 --> 03:55.130]  So far, nobody has identified who said that little clip.
[03:55.130 --> 03:58.150]  They simply say, oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[03:58.150 --> 04:00.310]  If you can identify who that person is,
[04:00.310 --> 04:01.910]  you will win a prize.
[04:01.910 --> 04:03.670]  There's also another contest with a prize
[04:03.670 --> 04:05.990]  available at the start of that episode.
[04:05.990 --> 04:07.430]  There's a backwards clip.
[04:07.430 --> 04:09.050]  I played a clip backwards,
[04:09.050 --> 04:11.150]  and it's a person saying something.
[04:11.150 --> 04:14.010]  If you can identify the person, you win one prize.
[04:14.010 --> 04:16.810]  If you can identify what that person says,
[04:16.810 --> 04:18.650]  you will win a second prize.
[04:18.650 --> 04:21.030]  So there are three options for prizes.
[04:21.030 --> 04:22.570]  I can't tell you what the prizes are
[04:22.570 --> 04:25.370]  because it will vary depending on your location and age.
[04:25.370 --> 04:27.410]  If you're here in Colorado and you're over 21,
[04:27.410 --> 04:30.490]  the prizes will be much cooler than if you're anywhere else.
[04:30.490 --> 04:32.010]  So three options.
[04:32.010 --> 04:33.850]  Listen again, episode 248.
[04:33.850 --> 04:36.650]  See if you can identify those voices.
[04:36.650 --> 04:38.410]  So far, everybody has been wrong.
[04:38.410 --> 04:40.050]  It is not Doug Benson.
[04:40.050 --> 04:42.130]  A lot of people keep guessing Doug Benson.
[04:42.130 --> 04:43.490]  It is not Doug Benson.
[04:43.490 --> 04:46.290]  Let me just say that because all of my inboxes
[04:46.290 --> 04:48.770]  are getting stuffed with guesses that it's Doug Benson.
[04:48.770 --> 04:51.290]  My email, my Instagram box, my Twitter.
[04:51.290 --> 04:52.950]  It is not Doug Benson, you guys.
[04:52.950 --> 04:54.810]  So don't guess Doug Benson.
[04:54.810 --> 04:55.850]  That is a wrong guess.
[04:55.850 --> 04:57.090]  It's somebody else.
[04:57.090 --> 04:58.250]  And it was not Ralphie Mae.
[04:58.250 --> 05:00.970]  Somebody else guessed Ralphie Mae, not Ralphie Mae.
[05:00.970 --> 05:02.810]  Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity
[05:02.810 --> 05:04.450]  to meet or hang out with Ralphie Mae.
[05:04.450 --> 05:06.170]  I've hung out and met and smoked
[05:06.170 --> 05:08.970]  and dabbed with a lot of my favorite comedians,
[05:08.970 --> 05:10.930]  but Ralphie Mae was just never available.
[05:10.930 --> 05:13.570]  He always did, he did the bigger shows.
[05:13.570 --> 05:14.930]  And the bigger shows, it's a little harder
[05:14.930 --> 05:17.050]  to meet those people that are on that level.
[05:17.050 --> 05:19.010]  There are certain levels of fame and success
[05:19.010 --> 05:20.730]  that these comedians get to.
[05:20.730 --> 05:23.650]  And it works if I meet them and discover them
[05:23.650 --> 05:25.130]  and make a presence with them
[05:25.130 --> 05:27.090]  right before they do the break.
[05:27.090 --> 05:28.170]  I missed Rogan.
[05:28.170 --> 05:30.890]  I don't interact with Joe Rogan,
[05:30.890 --> 05:32.690]  but I have smoked with Ari Shafir
[05:32.690 --> 05:34.490]  and I've smoked with Joey Diaz
[05:34.490 --> 05:36.890]  and I've smoked with a few of Rogan's buddies.
[05:36.890 --> 05:39.650]  And I am actual friends with Doug Benson
[05:39.650 --> 05:42.050]  and Jeff Tate and Guy O'Beelem
[05:42.050 --> 05:43.170]  and a few people on that level.
[05:43.170 --> 05:45.050]  So there are just certain levels to it.
[05:45.050 --> 05:47.010]  And now that I made friends with Doug Benson
[05:47.010 --> 05:49.410]  right before he got to the break that he's getting,
[05:49.410 --> 05:51.370]  he's on TV now and stuff like that.
[05:51.370 --> 05:53.770]  So I've gotta meet them right before they get there
[05:53.770 --> 05:56.170]  or before they get there or it's too late for me.
[05:56.170 --> 05:57.770]  So I never got to meet Ralphie.
[05:57.770 --> 06:01.010]  He was already super famous before I became a comedy nerd
[06:01.010 --> 06:03.190]  and started frequenting comedy shows.
[06:03.190 --> 06:04.590]  I did get to see Ralphie Mae
[06:04.590 --> 06:06.830]  at the Comedy Works South location.
[06:06.830 --> 06:08.510]  They call it the landmark location
[06:08.510 --> 06:10.030]  down at the Denver Tech Center.
[06:10.030 --> 06:13.090]  I got to see Ralphie there and he did an amazing show.
[06:13.090 --> 06:14.990]  There was a heckler that said something
[06:14.990 --> 06:15.910]  and Ralphie Mae told him,
[06:15.910 --> 06:17.830]  look motherfucker, there are four exit signs.
[06:17.830 --> 06:19.390]  They all show you how to get the fuck out of here.
[06:19.390 --> 06:21.650]  If you're not happy, get the fuck up and leave.
[06:21.650 --> 06:23.170]  And just the way he did it was so smooth.
[06:23.170 --> 06:25.310]  He did not miss a beat in his act.
[06:25.310 --> 06:27.190]  He just roasted that heckler.
[06:27.190 --> 06:28.350]  Anyway, not Ralphie Mae.
[06:28.350 --> 06:30.830]  I'm not sure why I went off on such a long rant about comedy.
[06:30.830 --> 06:34.210]  Maybe it's because I love dabs and comedy.
[06:34.210 --> 06:37.270]  My point was, it's not Doug Benson, it's not Ralphie Mae.
[06:37.270 --> 06:38.670]  So I would love it if you keep guessing.
[06:38.670 --> 06:40.190]  Send your guesses to me.
[06:40.190 --> 06:41.670]  Your best bet is to email me
[06:41.670 --> 06:43.630]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:43.630 --> 06:46.990]  You can always tweet the guesses to me at GFYH podcast.
[06:46.990 --> 06:48.230]  You can find me on Facebook.
[06:48.230 --> 06:50.750]  I will take your guesses however you can get them.
[06:50.750 --> 06:52.590]  But the best way to get them to me
[06:52.590 --> 06:53.790]  to where I'll find them the easiest
[06:53.790 --> 06:55.390]  is to send them to me via email
[06:55.390 --> 06:59.310]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:59.310 --> 07:01.330]  All right, now that I've got all the business caught up
[07:01.330 --> 07:02.430]  and all that stuff out of the way,
[07:02.430 --> 07:05.190]  let's get into some listener emails.
[07:05.190 --> 07:07.230]  I love it when you guys email me with questions
[07:07.230 --> 07:08.710]  and when you need help and guidance.
[07:08.710 --> 07:11.070]  It lets me know that I'm hitting my target audience
[07:11.070 --> 07:13.430]  because at least one person needed help with this.
[07:13.430 --> 07:15.150]  And I figured that if one person needed help,
[07:15.150 --> 07:16.550]  there's probably a lot more out there
[07:16.550 --> 07:18.710]  that haven't bothered to send me an email about it.
[07:18.710 --> 07:20.470]  So let's get into this email.
[07:20.470 --> 07:21.550]  I'm just gonna pull the first one
[07:21.550 --> 07:22.630]  off the stack of emails here.
[07:22.630 --> 07:23.870]  I've got quite a few.
[07:23.870 --> 07:26.750]  This one, let's see, do they want me to use their name?
[07:26.750 --> 07:27.750]  I'm gonna go quick.
[07:27.750 --> 07:28.570]  All right, they don't say.
[07:28.570 --> 07:30.690]  It goes like this, hey Rasta, it's me again,
[07:30.690 --> 07:32.510]  the guy who asked about the trellis,
[07:32.510 --> 07:33.930]  but most call me low lids.
[07:33.930 --> 07:36.430]  I had two questions I was wanting to run by you.
[07:37.450 --> 07:38.930]  When should I top a plant?
[07:38.930 --> 07:40.890]  Been thinking of doing it in one of my grows,
[07:40.890 --> 07:42.850]  wasn't sure when the best time would be.
[07:42.850 --> 07:45.570]  And second, I know you don't personally grow with DWC,
[07:45.570 --> 07:47.590]  which is deep water culture, you guys,
[07:47.590 --> 07:49.170]  but I'm currently going with that method
[07:49.170 --> 07:50.810]  and I wasn't sure if you knew anyone
[07:50.810 --> 07:53.810]  that could come on the show and give some advice and tips.
[07:53.810 --> 07:55.890]  Loving the show, man, getting closer to getting caught up
[07:55.890 --> 07:57.930]  and thanks for the info and knowledge.
[07:57.930 --> 08:02.330]  Take it easy and take a gnarly dab for me, brother.
[08:02.330 --> 08:04.330]  All right, first off, let me say thanks for the great email.
[08:04.330 --> 08:06.810]  This gives me a lot of opportunity to talk about topping.
[08:06.810 --> 08:09.090]  Topping is a very useful trick
[08:09.090 --> 08:10.370]  that you can do in your garden.
[08:10.370 --> 08:14.370]  So also this guy said, take a gnarly dab for me.
[08:14.370 --> 08:15.650]  So I'm gonna press pause here, you guys.
[08:15.650 --> 08:17.210]  I feel like I'm talking kind of fast.
[08:17.210 --> 08:18.690]  I know you guys don't wanna listen to me dab
[08:18.690 --> 08:19.930]  and cough into the microphone.
[08:19.930 --> 08:22.130]  So I'm going to follow listener instructions.
[08:22.130 --> 08:25.210]  I'm gonna take a gnarly dab and then I'll be right back
[08:25.210 --> 08:27.050]  and I will talk about topping plants
[08:27.050 --> 08:29.250]  and then I will talk about my minimal experience
[08:29.250 --> 08:31.210]  with deep water culture.
[08:31.210 --> 08:32.850]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[08:32.850 --> 08:35.730]  I just took some gigantic dabs of lemon OG haze.
[08:35.730 --> 08:38.350]  It was bred by Colin at the Ethos Collective.
[08:38.350 --> 08:40.810]  It was grown by the crew at Three Rivers
[08:40.810 --> 08:43.770]  and it was processed by our friends over at The Craft.
[08:43.770 --> 08:46.170]  Great work to everybody involved.
[08:46.170 --> 08:47.490]  I really liked the flavor of that.
[08:47.490 --> 08:50.410]  It was like a, like sort of a lemon,
[08:50.410 --> 08:52.570]  like a lemon candy, but not real overwhelming,
[08:52.570 --> 08:53.930]  like a light lemon candy,
[08:53.930 --> 08:56.710]  like a diluted lemon candy almost, but in a good way.
[08:57.250 --> 08:59.290]  Sometimes too much lemon can be too much lemon,
[08:59.290 --> 09:00.130]  if you know what I mean.
[09:00.130 --> 09:01.290]  It was really delicious.
[09:01.290 --> 09:02.850]  I think the next time I take a dab of it,
[09:02.850 --> 09:05.870]  I'm going to dunk it into these Lemon Jeffrey Terps.
[09:05.870 --> 09:07.730]  I've got some Lemon Jeffrey High Terpene
[09:07.730 --> 09:10.650]  full spectrum extract that I have not finished.
[09:10.650 --> 09:12.110]  So I think I'm gonna drop a little bit of that
[09:12.110 --> 09:14.050]  on there next time, really lemon it up.
[09:14.050 --> 09:16.910]  And that way it'll be too much lemon in a good way.
[09:17.790 --> 09:19.970]  All right, I think I'm back.
[09:19.970 --> 09:21.990]  I think I can answer a question.
[09:21.990 --> 09:24.610]  Our listener sent an email asking about topping.
[09:24.610 --> 09:26.530]  Let's talk about topping.
[09:26.530 --> 09:28.730]  I could go on and on about topping cannabis plants,
[09:28.730 --> 09:32.010]  but I will try to keep it concise and stick to the point.
[09:32.010 --> 09:32.850]  Topping.
[09:32.850 --> 09:35.770]  Our listener asked about the best time for topping.
[09:35.770 --> 09:37.990]  The time to top depends on your goal.
[09:37.990 --> 09:39.210]  Why are you topping?
[09:40.570 --> 09:43.090]  A lot of us are topping to create a wider canopy.
[09:43.090 --> 09:44.770]  That's what I'm topping for.
[09:44.770 --> 09:46.650]  When you grow cannabis plants,
[09:46.650 --> 09:48.770]  once it starts branching out a little bit,
[09:48.770 --> 09:50.970]  one branch in the middle will take off
[09:50.970 --> 09:52.110]  way higher than the others.
[09:52.110 --> 09:53.810]  That's called apical dominance.
[09:53.810 --> 09:56.730]  That one plant, that one branch wants to be on top.
[09:56.730 --> 09:58.170]  That is so when the pollen comes
[09:58.170 --> 10:00.270]  that that one branch is certain to get pollinated
[10:00.270 --> 10:02.190]  so that it can make seeds for the future.
[10:02.190 --> 10:04.910]  That's why you notice your male plants tend to be taller.
[10:04.910 --> 10:06.990]  They're trying to shoot up top so that when they pollinate,
[10:06.990 --> 10:09.810]  they can drop their pollen down onto the girls below them.
[10:09.810 --> 10:11.870]  So the tall parts, they're shooting up there
[10:11.870 --> 10:14.770]  so that they can get pollen or drop the pollen.
[10:14.770 --> 10:17.850]  So you top them to take out that top main node
[10:17.850 --> 10:20.010]  and then all of the leftover nodes
[10:20.010 --> 10:21.890]  will compete for top space.
[10:21.890 --> 10:23.810]  But since you've taken out that top,
[10:23.810 --> 10:26.370]  if you do it right, you've already created sort of a canopy,
[10:26.370 --> 10:29.610]  a level, an even layer of tops
[10:29.610 --> 10:32.010]  and they will all become your main tops.
[10:32.010 --> 10:34.850]  And then if you want to do it again, you can top those also.
[10:34.850 --> 10:37.570]  So let's talk about timing of topping.
[10:37.570 --> 10:40.510]  It kind of depends on what you're trying to do
[10:40.510 --> 10:42.330]  based on when you want to top the plant.
[10:42.330 --> 10:44.890]  So what I like to do is let the plant grow
[10:44.890 --> 10:46.370]  in about a four inch pot
[10:46.370 --> 10:48.450]  and then once it starts getting tight into that,
[10:48.450 --> 10:51.770]  I put it into a three gallon pot with a soilless mix.
[10:52.610 --> 10:54.330]  It's usually a lot of cocoa, a lot of perlite in there
[10:54.330 --> 10:55.710]  and then it kind of depends on where I am
[10:55.710 --> 10:57.290]  and where I'm working.
[10:57.290 --> 10:58.690]  It depends on what I'm doing.
[10:58.690 --> 11:00.650]  But when I put it into that three gallon pot,
[11:00.650 --> 11:02.210]  it's starting to branch out.
[11:02.210 --> 11:03.810]  While I'm transplanting all of them,
[11:03.810 --> 11:06.370]  I'll go through and cut the top out of all of them.
[11:06.370 --> 11:07.930]  So the plant should be,
[11:07.930 --> 11:09.330]  I'm trying to measure with my hands,
[11:09.330 --> 11:10.770]  that's about 12 to 18 inches tall.
[11:10.770 --> 11:11.770]  It's about 16 inches.
[11:11.770 --> 11:13.170]  It's a little longer than a drumstick.
[11:13.170 --> 11:15.090]  So it's about 18 inches, I guess.
[11:15.090 --> 11:18.850]  About the top, usually four to six inches of that
[11:18.850 --> 11:20.850]  is going to be that main top node
[11:20.850 --> 11:22.490]  that I'm talking about cutting out.
[11:22.490 --> 11:24.210]  So I like to grab that top branch
[11:24.210 --> 11:25.730]  and just work my way down
[11:25.730 --> 11:26.810]  and just run your hand down it
[11:26.810 --> 11:28.310]  and you can see where to cut.
[11:28.310 --> 11:29.690]  Just kind of tip it over at a spot
[11:29.690 --> 11:31.370]  and say, would that make me even?
[11:31.370 --> 11:32.930]  And you want to make all the other tops,
[11:32.930 --> 11:33.810]  you want to even them out.
[11:33.810 --> 11:35.570]  You can see where the other tops are.
[11:35.570 --> 11:37.990]  You've got like a crown, like a little menorah coming out.
[11:37.990 --> 11:40.090]  You've got a bunch of branches that even up.
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.650]  Maybe if you've got a more stretchy plant,
[11:41.650 --> 11:43.730]  you've only got two of those coming up, right?
[11:43.730 --> 11:45.730]  So there's going to be the top one
[11:45.730 --> 11:47.450]  and then there's a node coming off the left
[11:47.450 --> 11:49.070]  and a node coming off the right.
[11:49.070 --> 11:51.190]  Take off right before that left node,
[11:51.190 --> 11:52.590]  just leave that left and right node.
[11:52.590 --> 11:54.830]  If you take out that top piece right out of the middle,
[11:54.830 --> 11:56.390]  you've officially topped that.
[11:56.390 --> 11:58.190]  If you've got a branchier plant,
[11:58.190 --> 12:00.110]  you can go down lower and cut out
[12:00.110 --> 12:01.330]  until you make them all even.
[12:01.330 --> 12:03.310]  Just keep cutting out that center one.
[12:03.310 --> 12:05.950]  Now, there are a lot of different ways to do it.
[12:05.950 --> 12:07.630]  I like to leave some space.
[12:07.630 --> 12:09.670]  I recently, I used to top two close together.
[12:09.670 --> 12:11.470]  I would top two of those two branches
[12:11.470 --> 12:13.550]  or just V-in out real close together.
[12:13.550 --> 12:15.230]  You can do that if you're not going to grow
[12:15.230 --> 12:16.750]  a lot of plants in a tight space.
[12:16.750 --> 12:19.150]  I'm growing a lot of plants in a tight space.
[12:19.150 --> 12:22.110]  I go a little bit lower to create a little more space
[12:22.110 --> 12:23.710]  between my new tops.
[12:23.710 --> 12:25.750]  So you're mainly asking about timing.
[12:25.750 --> 12:27.390]  When do you want to top?
[12:27.390 --> 12:31.830]  If you let that top branch start to show itself,
[12:31.830 --> 12:33.310]  that's when I top.
[12:33.310 --> 12:34.950]  What my friend Subcool does,
[12:34.950 --> 12:37.110]  as soon as the plant is big enough, he tops.
[12:37.110 --> 12:39.670]  As soon as it starts showing its first Y section,
[12:39.670 --> 12:41.270]  like this branch is going to go off this way,
[12:41.270 --> 12:43.030]  this branch is going to go off this way,
[12:43.030 --> 12:45.090]  and the plant's gotten nice and sturdy now,
[12:45.090 --> 12:46.250]  as soon as it looks sexy,
[12:46.250 --> 12:48.290]  Sub goes in there and takes the top out of it.
[12:48.290 --> 12:50.450]  It's kind of shocking, it's a little bit brutal,
[12:50.450 --> 12:53.850]  but Subcool pulls mad weight off of his plants.
[12:53.850 --> 12:57.770]  Two, his plants look like two of everybody else's plants
[12:57.770 --> 12:59.930]  because he topped them so early.
[12:59.930 --> 13:03.050]  Now, if I did that method, I would top them very small
[13:03.050 --> 13:06.090]  and I would let them grow and I would re-top them.
[13:06.090 --> 13:07.970]  So now you've made two branches, right?
[13:07.970 --> 13:09.530]  Now, if you go back a little later
[13:09.530 --> 13:12.010]  and top the tops of those, those will branch into two.
[13:12.010 --> 13:13.790]  And now you've got four main tops.
[13:15.290 --> 13:16.810]  It depends on what you want to do.
[13:16.810 --> 13:18.130]  I'm pretty sure you're going to be
[13:18.130 --> 13:19.890]  scrogging with the trellis.
[13:19.890 --> 13:21.690]  So I would do the method where they grow out
[13:21.690 --> 13:24.370]  into a nice bush and then just take that main top
[13:24.370 --> 13:26.450]  out of there to where they're all even.
[13:26.450 --> 13:27.690]  I experiment a little.
[13:27.690 --> 13:29.870]  Go high, cut out the top kind of high.
[13:29.870 --> 13:31.950]  Decide you want to cut lower, go a little lower.
[13:31.950 --> 13:34.810]  You can always cut more off, but you can't put any back
[13:34.810 --> 13:36.850]  is something you should always remember.
[13:36.850 --> 13:40.610]  So when I'm topping, I'm topping to create an even canopy.
[13:40.610 --> 13:42.330]  If I've got 12 golden goat plants
[13:42.330 --> 13:44.090]  that have all vegged the same length and time,
[13:44.090 --> 13:46.370]  they should all be about the same amount of bushiness.
[13:46.370 --> 13:47.970]  There's always that one damn branch
[13:47.970 --> 13:49.270]  that sticks out of the top.
[13:49.270 --> 13:51.770]  I go through and cut her out and I cut a little bit lower
[13:51.770 --> 13:54.210]  than you would imagine to make some space in my top
[13:54.210 --> 13:55.970]  so that when I put the trellis on them,
[13:55.970 --> 13:57.290]  it's spread out nice and evenly
[13:57.290 --> 14:00.370]  and I don't have that one goofy one sticking up real bad.
[14:00.370 --> 14:02.370]  You said that you were the trellis guy in the email,
[14:02.370 --> 14:03.850]  so you're going to be trellising.
[14:03.850 --> 14:05.530]  That's how I would do it for you.
[14:05.530 --> 14:07.070]  So spread them out to create a canopy.
[14:07.070 --> 14:09.310]  This will give you a better yield.
[14:09.310 --> 14:13.010]  So if you top early, you're going to get these huge
[14:13.010 --> 14:14.850]  two branches and then you're going to get,
[14:14.850 --> 14:17.290]  you could top those again, you're going to have four branches.
[14:17.290 --> 14:18.810]  If you wait till it grows up a little bit
[14:18.810 --> 14:20.370]  till you get that crown, that menorah,
[14:20.370 --> 14:23.090]  and make that top one come out, you create a little bush.
[14:23.090 --> 14:24.250]  That's what I prefer.
[14:24.250 --> 14:27.250]  So do the little bushy thing, then put it under your scrog,
[14:27.250 --> 14:29.770]  pull one of those branches through every square
[14:29.770 --> 14:31.530]  of your scrog, and now you've started
[14:31.530 --> 14:32.490]  a nice little canopy.
[14:32.490 --> 14:35.330]  A nice little canopy will give you a nice yield.
[14:35.330 --> 14:37.610]  One thing you're doing, by topping,
[14:37.610 --> 14:39.510]  you're taking out that main top.
[14:39.510 --> 14:41.350]  A lot of people say there goes your main cola.
[14:41.350 --> 14:43.230]  Yeah, that thing was going to grow up into the light
[14:43.230 --> 14:44.230]  and get burnt.
[14:44.230 --> 14:46.030]  It was going to prevent you from lowering the lights
[14:46.030 --> 14:48.470]  to get all of those other buds a whole bunch of light.
[14:48.470 --> 14:50.350]  Now, you spread it out with the screen,
[14:50.350 --> 14:51.830]  you take out that main top,
[14:51.830 --> 14:54.670]  and you've got this nice little layer of buds
[14:54.670 --> 14:55.670]  all over the place.
[14:55.670 --> 14:57.650]  Instead of having one giant cola,
[14:57.650 --> 14:59.270]  if you've got a five by five space,
[14:59.270 --> 15:02.110]  you've probably got five by five space
[15:02.110 --> 15:04.330]  worth of nice little buds that are all the same size,
[15:04.330 --> 15:06.310]  they look uniform, and they're beautiful.
[15:06.310 --> 15:09.390]  So top it, throw down one screen,
[15:09.390 --> 15:11.270]  let it grow for a few days into the other screen,
[15:12.070 --> 15:13.150]  depending on your space,
[15:13.150 --> 15:16.230]  somewhere between, sometimes we go only six inches apart
[15:16.230 --> 15:17.830]  with the screens, depending on what strain.
[15:17.830 --> 15:19.990]  Sometimes we go 10 to 12 inches apart,
[15:19.990 --> 15:21.270]  depending on what strain it is.
[15:21.270 --> 15:23.530]  Jack Flash is a floppy little bitch.
[15:23.530 --> 15:26.950]  Jack Flash, you could put Scrognettes up every six inches,
[15:26.950 --> 15:28.910]  all the way through the whole canopy with Jack Flash.
[15:28.910 --> 15:30.230]  He's just so floppy.
[15:30.230 --> 15:32.890]  So, top it, get it under the screen,
[15:32.890 --> 15:33.970]  top it multiple times.
[15:33.970 --> 15:37.030]  Now, here's something that really matters a lot.
[15:37.030 --> 15:38.190]  After you've topped your plants,
[15:38.190 --> 15:40.910]  give yourself at least 10 to 14 days
[15:41.550 --> 15:43.510]  to veg those plants before you put them into flower.
[15:43.510 --> 15:45.650]  You just took out the main top of those plants
[15:45.650 --> 15:48.030]  that held the main hormones in that plant.
[15:48.030 --> 15:49.790]  All of those branches have to re-decide
[15:49.790 --> 15:50.930]  who's gonna be the top now.
[15:50.930 --> 15:52.070]  They're all gonna start growing up,
[15:52.070 --> 15:53.790]  acting like they're gonna be the tops.
[15:53.790 --> 15:54.830]  It's gonna work beautifully,
[15:54.830 --> 15:57.250]  because now you've got a nice, even canopy.
[15:57.250 --> 15:58.950]  So, after you've topped your plants,
[15:58.950 --> 16:01.650]  give them at least 10 to 14 days to recover
[16:01.650 --> 16:03.510]  from the shock you just put them into
[16:03.510 --> 16:04.930]  before you put them into flower.
[16:04.930 --> 16:06.750]  If you don't, you're only gonna grow
[16:06.750 --> 16:09.090]  little tiny buds out of all those top sites.
[16:09.130 --> 16:11.850]  They're not gonna perform the way you wish they would.
[16:11.850 --> 16:14.370]  That's the guy who says you just cut out your main cola.
[16:14.370 --> 16:17.490]  Yeah, he probably didn't give his plants time to recover
[16:17.490 --> 16:19.530]  after he did it and he got little shitty buds.
[16:19.530 --> 16:21.050]  So, if you're gonna top your plants,
[16:21.050 --> 16:22.990]  give yourself at least 10 days.
[16:22.990 --> 16:26.510]  I would prefer 14 days before you put them into flower.
[16:26.510 --> 16:28.590]  Now, your main question was when to top them.
[16:28.590 --> 16:29.970]  That's kind of up to you.
[16:29.970 --> 16:31.290]  When you see them branching out
[16:31.290 --> 16:32.650]  the way that you want them to branch out,
[16:32.650 --> 16:35.290]  once they've got like four or five branches
[16:35.290 --> 16:37.170]  coming off of them that are competing to be the tops
[16:37.170 --> 16:38.290]  and you take out that main top,
[16:38.290 --> 16:39.730]  they'll really start branching.
[16:39.730 --> 16:40.930]  So, you can top them early
[16:40.930 --> 16:42.530]  when they're still in little pots.
[16:42.530 --> 16:44.210]  I like to do it when they start getting
[16:44.210 --> 16:46.490]  a lot of branches and a nice root ball.
[16:46.490 --> 16:47.810]  I like to do it when they're probably,
[16:47.810 --> 16:50.570]  like I said, about 16, maybe 18 inches tall.
[16:50.570 --> 16:51.630]  Take out that main top,
[16:51.630 --> 16:53.970]  bring them back down to about 12 inches.
[16:53.970 --> 16:55.450]  They look really sexy when you do it too.
[16:55.450 --> 16:56.490]  They look all nice and even.
[16:56.490 --> 16:58.850]  It looks like you gave everybody a nice flat top.
[16:58.850 --> 17:01.410]  So, I don't know how fast your plants are going to grow.
[17:01.410 --> 17:03.210]  I don't know how they're going to perform in your garden.
[17:03.210 --> 17:04.770]  I don't know what kind of lights you've got.
[17:04.770 --> 17:07.430]  I don't know what kind of genetics you're using.
[17:07.430 --> 17:09.430]  All I really know is that you're using deep water culture
[17:09.430 --> 17:10.690]  and you're scrugging it.
[17:10.690 --> 17:14.250]  So, top it when it starts to get kind of branchy.
[17:14.250 --> 17:17.390]  And I usually do it right about the time I up-pot
[17:17.390 --> 17:20.070]  from a small pot to my finishing pot.
[17:20.070 --> 17:22.950]  Which like I said, is usually a four by four square pot
[17:22.950 --> 17:26.030]  or a six inch net pot into a three gallon pot.
[17:26.030 --> 17:29.110]  I'm always using a bunch of cocoa, a bunch of perlite,
[17:29.110 --> 17:30.510]  maybe a soilless mix.
[17:30.510 --> 17:32.530]  Just depends on what facility I'm growing in.
[17:32.530 --> 17:34.510]  If I'm at a commercial facility, if I'm at home,
[17:34.510 --> 17:38.070]  if I'm breeding, that's usually just why it varies.
[17:38.070 --> 17:39.990]  So, that's what I would talk you guys.
[17:39.990 --> 17:41.230]  I hope that answers your question.
[17:41.230 --> 17:43.310]  I said I was going to keep it short and concise
[17:43.310 --> 17:44.750]  and I lied to you.
[17:44.750 --> 17:46.710]  I apologize for that.
[17:46.710 --> 17:48.530]  All right, now the next part of your question
[17:48.530 --> 17:50.930]  was for tips on deep water culture.
[17:50.930 --> 17:52.450]  And you know that I don't personally grow
[17:52.450 --> 17:53.290]  deep water culture.
[17:53.290 --> 17:55.710]  So, thanks for being gentle on me with that.
[17:55.710 --> 17:58.350]  The couple of things I do know about deep water culture
[17:58.350 --> 17:59.430]  really do matter.
[17:59.430 --> 18:00.910]  One of them is pH.
[18:00.910 --> 18:03.230]  You have got to keep that pH under control.
[18:03.270 --> 18:05.270]  The pH gets too high or too low,
[18:05.270 --> 18:07.730]  things can go wrong very quickly
[18:07.730 --> 18:09.790]  with your deep water culture system.
[18:09.790 --> 18:11.870]  Maybe I should talk about what a deep water culture system
[18:11.870 --> 18:13.070]  is real quick.
[18:13.070 --> 18:14.190]  There are different ways to do it,
[18:14.190 --> 18:18.310]  but mostly you've got a plant that is suspended in a medium.
[18:18.310 --> 18:20.050]  Most of the time it starts off with those little
[18:20.050 --> 18:22.590]  hydroton pebbles in a small net pot.
[18:22.590 --> 18:25.030]  And that sits in another bucket usually.
[18:25.030 --> 18:27.870]  And that bucket has a sprayer on the bottom of it
[18:27.870 --> 18:31.790]  that sprays a continuous spray to the bottom of the roots
[18:31.790 --> 18:33.550]  to keep them alive just through a spray.
[18:33.550 --> 18:35.470]  Instead of constantly sitting in water
[18:35.470 --> 18:37.110]  or instead of sitting in a soil,
[18:37.110 --> 18:39.630]  they're getting oxygenated water all the time
[18:39.630 --> 18:42.190]  spraying up to them with nutrients in it as well.
[18:42.190 --> 18:43.190]  So they're getting oxygen,
[18:43.190 --> 18:45.190]  they're getting plenty of nutrients.
[18:45.190 --> 18:47.570]  The roots grow fucking rapidly
[18:47.570 --> 18:48.870]  in a deep water culture system.
[18:48.870 --> 18:49.950]  There are a lot of ways to do it.
[18:49.950 --> 18:51.930]  My explanation was very brief,
[18:51.930 --> 18:55.270]  but you're basically hanging the roots over a sprayer.
[18:55.270 --> 18:56.490]  The little easy cloners,
[18:56.490 --> 18:58.610]  that is basically the start of deep water culture.
[18:58.610 --> 19:01.350]  Deep water culture is that you just go bigger.
[19:02.190 --> 19:04.310]  You can do it with multiple plants in one thing.
[19:04.310 --> 19:07.750]  The most common way I've seen it is one plant in one bucket.
[19:07.750 --> 19:09.430]  Like I said, you've got a five gallon bucket,
[19:09.430 --> 19:11.510]  maybe a seven gallon bucket with a lid
[19:11.510 --> 19:13.550]  with a little modified hole into it.
[19:13.550 --> 19:15.150]  And then a net pot sits in that
[19:15.150 --> 19:18.990]  and you put your hydroton or your pebbles into that net pot.
[19:18.990 --> 19:20.290]  And then you set a clone inside of there.
[19:20.290 --> 19:22.710]  It's usually the clone starts off in a rockwool cube
[19:22.710 --> 19:23.910]  or something to keep it balanced.
[19:23.910 --> 19:25.350]  You set that in there.
[19:25.350 --> 19:27.270]  You put a sprayer in there.
[19:27.270 --> 19:28.430]  It sprays up from the bottom
[19:28.430 --> 19:30.230]  and keeps the roots wet at all times.
[19:30.230 --> 19:31.750]  And those roots just grow.
[19:31.750 --> 19:33.030]  The roots grow like crazy.
[19:33.030 --> 19:35.830]  So what really matters in there is the pH.
[19:35.830 --> 19:38.950]  The pH in deep water culture is super important.
[19:38.950 --> 19:41.710]  When you're growing in hydroponic mediums and methods,
[19:41.710 --> 19:45.110]  the pH and PPMs and temps are much more important
[19:45.110 --> 19:47.910]  than when you're growing in like a soilless mix or in soil.
[19:47.910 --> 19:49.470]  So it's much more critical.
[19:49.470 --> 19:51.270]  In a deep water culture, like everything else,
[19:51.270 --> 19:54.670]  you've got to keep the pH of your solution around,
[19:55.510 --> 19:59.230]  the books all say, the internet all says 5.5 to 6.5.
[19:59.230 --> 20:02.070]  It's gonna be very plant specific.
[20:02.070 --> 20:04.830]  You'll notice that if you've got OG Cush in one pot
[20:04.830 --> 20:06.790]  and Super Silver Haze in another pot,
[20:06.790 --> 20:09.190]  that they're going to want different pHs.
[20:09.190 --> 20:12.150]  And you're going to have to learn that about each plant.
[20:12.150 --> 20:14.710]  It depends on, it just depends on your plant, you guys.
[20:14.710 --> 20:17.910]  So I would start off, maybe start off around 6.3
[20:17.910 --> 20:19.310]  and maybe work your way down.
[20:19.310 --> 20:21.630]  And if that doesn't seem to do it, go back up.
[20:21.630 --> 20:24.650]  You'll have to learn how to identify pH issues
[20:24.650 --> 20:25.830]  in your plants.
[20:25.830 --> 20:28.050]  Hopefully if you start off around 6.3,
[20:28.050 --> 20:29.410]  you won't have any problems.
[20:29.410 --> 20:31.130]  I run a large commercial grow.
[20:31.130 --> 20:34.290]  We usually go about 6.2, 6.3 on the pH.
[20:34.290 --> 20:37.130]  And that keeps, we've got 43 different strains,
[20:37.130 --> 20:39.570]  somewhere between 40 and 50, about 40,
[20:39.570 --> 20:41.530]  I'm gonna say 43, I'm guessing.
[20:41.530 --> 20:43.410]  There's about 40, 43 different strains
[20:43.410 --> 20:44.770]  on our shelves right now.
[20:44.770 --> 20:49.030]  And 6.2, 6.3 keeps them all fairly happy.
[20:49.030 --> 20:50.890]  I can tell that a couple, like some of the other things
[20:50.890 --> 20:52.870]  would like a little lower, but I can't do it
[20:52.870 --> 20:55.050]  because the other plants would probably get pissed off.
[20:55.050 --> 20:57.290]  So make sure you get your pH dialed in.
[20:57.290 --> 20:59.250]  Also your temperatures.
[20:59.250 --> 21:03.290]  You wanna be somewhere between like 67 and 72 degrees.
[21:03.290 --> 21:05.450]  Maybe just a little bit higher would be okay,
[21:05.450 --> 21:07.330]  but that's when you start getting problems.
[21:07.330 --> 21:08.330]  You don't wanna go too cold
[21:08.330 --> 21:09.370]  because the roots will get shocked.
[21:09.370 --> 21:12.850]  You don't wanna go too high, you'll start getting mildews.
[21:12.850 --> 21:15.970]  So somewhere between like 67 and 72 degrees
[21:15.970 --> 21:19.170]  is ideal for your water temperature, the water temperature.
[21:19.170 --> 21:21.010]  You've gotta keep the air around the plant
[21:21.010 --> 21:24.050]  a different temperature than the water temperature.
[21:24.050 --> 21:26.490]  Also the PPMs are very important.
[21:26.490 --> 21:28.370]  That's something you're going to have to learn
[21:28.370 --> 21:29.730]  on a plant basis.
[21:29.730 --> 21:33.850]  It'll be a strain specific, plant by plant specific basis
[21:33.850 --> 21:36.010]  on how many PPMs to feed your plant.
[21:36.010 --> 21:37.330]  Never go too high.
[21:37.330 --> 21:40.130]  I read often that like 1800 is too high,
[21:40.130 --> 21:43.070]  but if you know what you're doing, you can push the limits.
[21:43.070 --> 21:44.610]  I'm not telling you to go crazy.
[21:44.610 --> 21:47.250]  Don't feed them rocket fuel, they will burn.
[21:47.250 --> 21:49.850]  Another thing we should talk about is water quality.
[21:49.850 --> 21:51.950]  Check the quality of the water you're starting with.
[21:51.950 --> 21:56.130]  If you've got a PPM meter, an EC meter, a pH meter,
[21:56.770 --> 21:57.610]  why don't you ever check the water
[21:57.610 --> 21:58.530]  that you're starting with?
[21:58.530 --> 22:00.130]  See what you are working with.
[22:00.130 --> 22:02.650]  I would recommend in a deep water culture system,
[22:02.650 --> 22:04.570]  I would recommend RO water.
[22:04.570 --> 22:08.370]  I would buy an RO system, a reverse osmosis system
[22:08.370 --> 22:10.650]  that would give you enough water that you're gonna need
[22:10.650 --> 22:13.290]  however often you're gonna change these buckets.
[22:13.290 --> 22:15.010]  So quality of the water is important.
[22:15.010 --> 22:16.490]  Start off with good water.
[22:16.490 --> 22:17.610]  Find out your PPMs.
[22:17.610 --> 22:19.950]  Find out how much shit is in that water before you start
[22:19.950 --> 22:21.210]  so that you can kind of do the math
[22:21.210 --> 22:23.310]  on what you're putting in also.
[22:23.310 --> 22:24.910]  Now another thing that I kind of mentioned
[22:24.910 --> 22:26.550]  is changing the water.
[22:26.550 --> 22:28.270]  You're going to need to change the water
[22:28.270 --> 22:31.630]  and clean out that deep water culture bucket every so often.
[22:31.630 --> 22:33.550]  I'm not sure how much funk is going to build up
[22:33.550 --> 22:35.270]  in your buckets, but I would recommend
[22:35.270 --> 22:38.150]  you change that water out at least once a week
[22:38.150 --> 22:40.710]  or every 10 days at minimum.
[22:40.710 --> 22:43.790]  The way I would do it, the way I have seen it done,
[22:43.790 --> 22:46.190]  instead of having just one five or seven gallon bucket
[22:46.190 --> 22:48.890]  as your base, it's really easy to have two of those
[22:48.890 --> 22:49.910]  as your base.
[22:49.910 --> 22:52.670]  So take the one that's got the pump and shit in there,
[22:52.670 --> 22:54.550]  take that lid right off, set your plant
[22:55.190 --> 22:56.430]  and root ball right inside that other bucket
[22:56.430 --> 22:57.670]  as a base for a little bit.
[22:57.670 --> 22:59.490]  You're going to need to put some water in there
[22:59.490 --> 23:01.750]  because you need weight to hold that plant up.
[23:01.750 --> 23:03.030]  I don't know if your roots are going to get
[23:03.030 --> 23:04.110]  into that water or not.
[23:04.110 --> 23:07.510]  If they do get into that water, pH that water.
[23:07.510 --> 23:09.990]  If the roots are going to hang into it, adjust the pH.
[23:09.990 --> 23:11.830]  If the roots aren't going to touch it, you'll be just fine.
[23:11.830 --> 23:13.470]  It's acting as a base.
[23:13.470 --> 23:15.790]  It's in there for weight, for support to hold that plant
[23:15.790 --> 23:16.990]  because you're putting weight at the top.
[23:16.990 --> 23:17.910]  You don't want it top heavy.
[23:17.910 --> 23:19.290]  That's why the water's there.
[23:19.290 --> 23:21.230]  That's a pro tip for you right before you fuck up.
[23:21.230 --> 23:23.350]  So take the other five gallon bucket with some water,
[23:23.350 --> 23:24.530]  set the plant right inside there.
[23:25.370 --> 23:27.370]  Then take the one that you've been using and clean it.
[23:27.370 --> 23:29.370]  Get a sponge or something and clean that shit out.
[23:29.370 --> 23:30.530]  Just wipe it down real good.
[23:30.530 --> 23:32.210]  Get a hose and hose it out if you can.
[23:32.210 --> 23:34.090]  I understand a lot of you live in apartments or whatever.
[23:34.090 --> 23:35.290]  You can't do that.
[23:35.290 --> 23:37.230]  Just clean it out the best that you can.
[23:37.230 --> 23:38.510]  You want this clean.
[23:38.510 --> 23:40.570]  If you can take some Fizan to it and scrub it out
[23:40.570 --> 23:42.370]  with Fizan, I would do that.
[23:42.370 --> 23:44.730]  So get your bucket, get anything that goes inside the bucket.
[23:44.730 --> 23:45.990]  Get it nice and clean.
[23:45.990 --> 23:48.890]  Fill it back up with the appropriate amount of water
[23:48.890 --> 23:50.610]  so that when you plug in your pump that it sprays
[23:50.610 --> 23:52.030]  to the bottom of the roots.
[23:52.030 --> 23:53.690]  Fill it up with the appropriate amount of water.
[23:53.690 --> 23:54.890]  Now put your nutrients in there.
[23:54.890 --> 23:57.970]  Put your, if you're using a potassium silicate,
[23:57.970 --> 24:01.370]  add that first, add your base, then add all your microbes.
[24:01.370 --> 24:03.490]  Then adjust the pH if you need to.
[24:03.490 --> 24:05.750]  Then put that plant right back into that main bucket
[24:05.750 --> 24:06.590]  that you started with.
[24:06.590 --> 24:07.810]  It's all clean, it's all brand new.
[24:07.810 --> 24:10.010]  It's got all fresh nutrients into it.
[24:10.010 --> 24:12.110]  Make sure the pH is cool, the PPMs are cool.
[24:12.110 --> 24:13.450]  Make sure the temperature's cool.
[24:13.450 --> 24:15.610]  Plug that bitch back in and get her growing.
[24:15.610 --> 24:17.250]  Now another thing you're gonna have to watch out for
[24:17.250 --> 24:19.650]  with deep water culture is those plants are growing
[24:19.650 --> 24:21.350]  to grow very quickly.
[24:21.350 --> 24:23.590]  So make sure you don't wait too long to flower
[24:24.490 --> 24:25.750]  before you're going to run out of sealing space.
[24:25.750 --> 24:27.710]  They're gonna go crazy.
[24:27.710 --> 24:29.670]  All right, so just a couple of more quick small tips
[24:29.670 --> 24:32.550]  before we wrap up the discussion on deep water culture.
[24:32.550 --> 24:34.750]  If you do buy those pebbles that they use,
[24:34.750 --> 24:36.110]  the hydroton clay pebbles,
[24:36.110 --> 24:37.690]  rinse the shit out of those things.
[24:37.690 --> 24:39.590]  They're gross, they're filthy.
[24:39.590 --> 24:41.510]  Put them in like a colander or something
[24:41.510 --> 24:43.190]  and just run water through them and shake them
[24:43.190 --> 24:44.470]  and rinse the shit out of them.
[24:44.470 --> 24:46.030]  They're really dirty, they're really dusty.
[24:46.030 --> 24:46.910]  If you start running those
[24:46.910 --> 24:48.570]  in your deep water culture buckets,
[24:48.570 --> 24:50.330]  it's going to start mucking up your stuff.
[24:50.330 --> 24:51.430]  It'll mess up your pH.
[24:51.430 --> 24:54.070]  It'll mess with all of your PPM readings.
[24:54.070 --> 24:55.490]  Clean that shit out of there.
[24:55.490 --> 24:57.450]  Also check everything daily.
[24:57.450 --> 24:58.870]  You're gonna have to check everything,
[24:58.870 --> 25:00.510]  the equipment, your pumps.
[25:00.510 --> 25:02.870]  Also check the pH and the PPMs.
[25:02.870 --> 25:04.390]  Make sure you get your temperatures in there
[25:04.390 --> 25:05.630]  dialed in every day.
[25:05.630 --> 25:08.110]  It doesn't need to change too much.
[25:08.110 --> 25:10.350]  If you notice that the water's getting low,
[25:10.350 --> 25:13.550]  add some water and make sure that you readjust the pH
[25:13.550 --> 25:14.390]  at that point.
[25:14.390 --> 25:17.150]  If your PPMs get too high because the water does evaporate,
[25:17.150 --> 25:18.830]  just add a little bit of water in there
[25:18.830 --> 25:20.910]  until you get the PPMs back to where you want them.
[25:21.390 --> 25:22.230]  Don't go too high.
[25:22.230 --> 25:25.790]  1600, 1800, that's pretty high on PPM levels.
[25:25.790 --> 25:27.310]  Make sure you check that.
[25:27.310 --> 25:29.590]  You don't want to burn your plants.
[25:29.590 --> 25:32.270]  Speaking of all of your pH and PPM and EC levels
[25:32.270 --> 25:34.270]  and all that good stuff and your temperatures,
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.530]  calibrate your tools.
[25:35.530 --> 25:37.470]  I don't know what kind of meters you're using.
[25:37.470 --> 25:38.830]  If you're using Blue Lab meters,
[25:38.830 --> 25:40.590]  if you're using Milwaukee meters,
[25:40.590 --> 25:43.870]  I highly suggest you invest in quality equipment.
[25:43.870 --> 25:46.610]  pH meters, EC meters, all that stuff,
[25:46.610 --> 25:49.270]  you're going to use it on a daily basis.
[25:49.270 --> 25:51.790]  These are things that help you ensure
[25:51.790 --> 25:53.710]  healthy and happy plants.
[25:53.710 --> 25:56.870]  So invest in quality meters, use them daily,
[25:56.870 --> 26:00.390]  check them very often, calibrate them as needed,
[26:00.390 --> 26:01.350]  and keep them clean.
[26:01.350 --> 26:04.110]  Also, with a pH meter, you guys always remember the rule,
[26:04.110 --> 26:05.710]  if it dries, it dies.
[26:05.710 --> 26:09.350]  So keep the probe on your pH meter wet at all times.
[26:09.350 --> 26:10.270]  Store it properly.
[26:10.270 --> 26:12.990]  I see so many people fucking ruin their pH meters
[26:12.990 --> 26:14.990]  by not keeping it wet.
[26:14.990 --> 26:16.990]  All right, I hope I gave you some useful advice there
[26:16.990 --> 26:18.310]  on deep water culture.
[26:18.310 --> 26:19.710]  I think I got some nuggets in there.
[26:19.710 --> 26:22.750]  Rinse those pebbles was probably a good trick to teach you.
[26:22.750 --> 26:24.290]  And everybody needs to be reminded
[26:24.290 --> 26:26.470]  to calibrate their meters occasionally.
[26:26.470 --> 26:28.310]  Also, while you're calibrating your meters,
[26:28.310 --> 26:29.530]  get in there and clean out the filters
[26:29.530 --> 26:31.470]  on your air conditioners if you've got one.
[26:31.470 --> 26:34.750]  That's something that people quite often forget about.
[26:34.750 --> 26:35.910]  All right, you guys, I'm going to start
[26:35.910 --> 26:36.910]  wrapping up this podcast.
[26:36.910 --> 26:38.050]  Thanks for the great email.
[26:38.050 --> 26:40.550]  If anybody else out there has a question for the podcast,

[26:43.110 --> 26:45.550]  That is the best way to get your questions answered.
[26:45.550 --> 26:47.630]  An even better way to get your question answered
[26:47.630 --> 26:49.290]  is to remind me that you contributed
[26:49.290 --> 26:50.510]  to the Patreon campaign.
[26:50.510 --> 26:52.210]  If you're not sure what Patreon is,
[26:52.210 --> 26:55.630]  make sure you check out patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[26:55.630 --> 26:58.510]  Patreon is a way that lets you as a podcast listener

[27:00.550 --> 27:03.630]  to help me to keep the podcast up on the website for free
[27:03.630 --> 27:05.270]  so that everybody else can listen.
[27:05.270 --> 27:07.390]  I'm not asking everybody to contribute,
[27:07.390 --> 27:09.750]  but there are some who can, and I would appreciate it.
[27:09.750 --> 27:10.910]  Big shout out again to the person
[27:10.910 --> 27:14.550]  who threw down a $4.20 contribution recently.
[27:14.550 --> 27:15.630]  That stands out.
[27:15.630 --> 27:17.510]  Their question got answered right away.
[27:18.350 --> 27:19.190]  I appreciate it.
[27:19.190 --> 27:20.750]  All right, I would love it if you follow me on social media.

[27:21.790 --> 27:23.590]  Simply search for the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[27:23.590 --> 27:24.730]  I'm on Twitter.
[27:24.730 --> 27:26.790]  You can find me at GFYH Podcast.
[27:26.790 --> 27:29.190]  And on Instagram, I use my other company name.
[27:29.190 --> 27:30.670]  It's Irie Genetics.
[27:30.670 --> 27:35.230]  Search for Irie, I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S,
[27:35.230 --> 27:37.870]  Irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[27:37.870 --> 27:40.590]  Irie is a word that means feeling the most blessed
[27:40.590 --> 27:43.230]  you could feel, feeling the best you could possibly feel.
[27:43.230 --> 27:45.030]  It's pleasing and powerful.
[27:45.030 --> 27:46.050]  It's Irie.
[27:47.050 --> 27:50.050]  Maybe for me, it's like sitting on a grassy hill
[27:50.050 --> 27:51.970]  underneath a tree, got some sunshine,
[27:51.970 --> 27:54.110]  just a little bit of wind, maybe got my lady
[27:54.110 --> 27:56.690]  or my dog with me, or maybe both,
[27:56.690 --> 27:58.650]  and it's not too bright and it's not too cold
[27:58.650 --> 28:00.710]  and it's just perfect and the grass is kinda cool
[28:00.710 --> 28:03.730]  on your butt and the grass feels nice on your toes
[28:03.730 --> 28:05.010]  and there's nothing to worry about
[28:05.010 --> 28:06.550]  and there's a little breeze going on
[28:06.550 --> 28:10.210]  and you're like, ah, and everything just feels all right.
[28:10.210 --> 28:11.130]  That's Irie.
[28:11.130 --> 28:12.770]  That's when you're feeling Irie.
[28:12.770 --> 28:15.130]  Everyone's got their own Irie space.
[28:15.170 --> 28:17.250]  My Irie spaces are behind a drum set.
[28:17.250 --> 28:18.330]  I love playing some drums.
[28:18.330 --> 28:19.870]  That's when I get that ah feeling
[28:19.870 --> 28:21.050]  when everything just falls together,
[28:21.050 --> 28:22.650]  when the bass guitar is playing,
[28:22.650 --> 28:24.610]  the guitar starts strumming and the drums are right there
[28:24.610 --> 28:25.930]  and everything is just in the pocket
[28:25.930 --> 28:27.730]  and all the people are dancing and loving it.
[28:27.730 --> 28:29.730]  That's such an Irie feeling for me.
[28:29.730 --> 28:32.650]  And then also growing, breeding, experiencing,
[28:32.650 --> 28:34.390]  teaching, loving cannabis,
[28:34.390 --> 28:36.310]  that's always been an Irie feeling for me.
[28:36.310 --> 28:39.170]  So it goes hand in hand, Irie genetics.
[28:39.170 --> 28:40.310]  See, I did wrap it all around.
[28:40.310 --> 28:41.910]  I wasn't just off on a random rant.
[28:41.910 --> 28:43.250]  Irie genetics on Instagram.
[28:43.250 --> 28:45.610]  I post a lot of cannabis photography up there, you guys.
[28:45.610 --> 28:47.390]  I post probably two or three photos a day,
[28:47.390 --> 28:49.510]  depending on how hectic my day is.
[28:49.510 --> 28:52.530]  I think that if you're into cannabis and cannabis photography
[28:52.530 --> 28:55.670]  there's something there that you would enjoy looking at.
[28:55.670 --> 28:57.210]  If there's something you'd like to say,
[28:57.210 --> 28:58.770]  if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[28:58.770 --> 29:00.930]  if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[29:00.930 --> 29:02.370]  you can simply send me an email
[29:02.370 --> 29:04.290]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:04.290 --> 29:06.130]  I would love to hear from you.
[29:06.130 --> 29:08.570]  I'll be back Thursday with the Throwback Thursday episode.
[29:08.570 --> 29:10.650]  And of course I'll be back Monday with the Freshie.
[29:10.650 --> 29:12.610]  I wanna give a huge shout out to Amber B.
[29:12.610 --> 29:14.930]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[29:14.930 --> 29:16.490]  and give your mom a hug for me.
