[01:02.100 --> 01:07.860]  I'm smoking. Today. I've been taking dabs of fat so number one full spectrum extract from
[01:07.860 --> 01:14.780]  green dot labs. This is a blend of GMO and legend og on the package. The flavor is described
[01:14.780 --> 01:21.020]  as dark roast, garlic and fuel. I think there is also a hint of bar trash can in here, which
[01:21.020 --> 01:26.980]  may sound disgusting, but I honestly love this gross, funky aroma that comes from the
[01:26.980 --> 01:31.980]  fat zone. There is definitely a dark roast aroma. There's a garlic there's a fuel, but
[01:31.980 --> 01:37.340]  then there is also I keep saying it a hint of funky bar trash can and I really can't
[01:37.340 --> 01:41.340]  get enough of it. I'm showing the diamonds to the camera there on the back of the package.
[01:41.340 --> 01:48.380]  It says it contains 82.68% THC and non detectable amounts of CBD. I'm sure you can tell by the
[01:48.380 --> 01:53.500]  intro of this podcast that the dab I just took fucked me up. My chest is caving in my
[01:53.500 --> 01:57.140]  lungs feel a little bit heavy. I'm over here trying to catch my breath. I'm sure you can
[01:57.140 --> 02:02.780]  hear it into the microphone. Big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the delicious
[02:02.780 --> 02:08.380]  fat zone number one full spectrum extract. I am heavily medicated. My eyes are nice and low.
[02:08.380 --> 02:11.580]  I'm chilling out in the new chair. If you're watching on the video, I'm sure you've noticed
[02:11.580 --> 02:16.940]  by now I am recording from a brand new recording area. That's right. I've set up a new little
[02:16.940 --> 02:21.740]  office space slash recording area. I will be getting the equipment dialed in I'll be getting
[02:21.740 --> 02:27.820]  the office recording space dialed in. Something I could use is a studio name. Every recording
[02:27.820 --> 02:32.940]  studio has got a cool studio name. I need a studio name. So you guys send me your submissions.
[02:32.940 --> 02:38.060]  I'd love to hear from you. You can send me a tweet on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast.
[02:38.060 --> 02:42.460]  You can send me a message on Facebook find the grow from your heart podcast. You can find me
[02:42.460 --> 02:47.340]  on Instagram. It's the grow from your heart podcast on Instagram or of course send me an email
[02:47.340 --> 02:54.380]  grow from your heart at hotmail.com I would love to hear from you help me name my brand new studio.
[02:54.380 --> 02:59.180]  Also, I've got a very important thing I want to talk about. I want to say happy birthday
[02:59.180 --> 03:04.140]  to motherfucking sub cool. I am recording on sub cools birthday. Happy birthday you bad
[03:04.140 --> 03:08.220]  motherfucker rest in peace sub cool. If you've been following me for a while you know that I
[03:08.220 --> 03:13.580]  learned a lot from sub cool. I know sub cool is a very controversial figure in the cannabis industry.
[03:13.580 --> 03:17.260]  You either love them or hate them. I've got nothing but love and respect for the dude.
[03:17.260 --> 03:23.340]  He taught me a lot. He taught me what to do and I keep saying it. He also taught me what not to do
[03:23.420 --> 03:28.940]  in the cannabis industry. Sub cool was a pioneer. He was way ahead of me in the game without his
[03:28.940 --> 03:33.900]  template his guideline his guidance his input his friendship and advice. I would not be the grower
[03:33.900 --> 03:39.980]  the breeder the podcaster that I am today. So happy birthday motherfucking sub cool. Miss you bro. Wish
[03:39.980 --> 03:44.060]  you were still here. Wish I could send you a message and you reply with some fucking off the
[03:44.060 --> 03:49.260]  wall crazy shit that I did not expect. But you're gone still love you. I'm going to keep growing in
[03:49.260 --> 03:54.780]  your honor. I did cross your jack the ripper to a bunch of my stuff. So we collabed sub cool and I
[03:54.780 --> 04:00.540]  talked about collabing quite often. But he always had so much going on and we were so far away and
[04:00.540 --> 04:05.660]  I always had a lot going on so we never did it. And I took the liberty of crossing his jack the
[04:05.660 --> 04:11.180]  ripper. I found a jack the ripper male. I pollinated a bunch of my elite females and some of my favorite
[04:11.180 --> 04:15.500]  female cuts with that jack the ripper. There are a bunch of seeds people are going to start asking
[04:15.500 --> 04:19.660]  for them again. They are not ready yet. They're getting sorted. They're getting counted. They'll be
[04:19.660 --> 04:25.660]  sent out to testers. Very soon. I'll grow a bunch out myself. Anyway, wanted to send love to sub cool.
[04:25.660 --> 04:30.060]  That's my whole point of that big rant. Big shout out. Happy motherfucking birthday to sub cool.
[04:30.060 --> 04:34.620]  Rest in peace, big man. Wish you were here. I fucking miss you. We celebrated sub cool today
[04:34.620 --> 04:40.380]  on Instagram a little bit. Queen V and will went on and did a one hour live session where they smoked
[04:40.380 --> 04:45.020]  a joint that was about the size of a small baseball bat. They were normal people at the
[04:45.020 --> 04:49.900]  start by the end. They were talking funny. They were pale and red faced at the same time. They
[04:49.900 --> 04:54.380]  were drooling and dizzy. It was fun to watch. Great times. Big shout out to those folks for
[04:54.380 --> 04:59.180]  keeping sub cool spirit alive today. Alright, you guys, I'm super rambly. This is the part of the

[06:10.860 --> 06:17.020]  to make it nice and easy for all of my stoner friends. All right. I'm looking at my notes to
[06:17.020 --> 06:21.260]  see where we are next. I feel like I've caught up on all the business. That was the business.
[06:21.260 --> 06:28.140]  That part's been handled. Let's talk about the main topic of today's podcast. I keep seeing a
[06:28.140 --> 06:33.020]  bunch of bullshit on the internet. You guys, people think that they can identify the sex of
[06:33.020 --> 06:38.460]  a seed by looking at the seed. People think that they've got gorilla glue for seeds. Let's talk
[06:38.460 --> 06:43.020]  about some bullshit that I keep reading on the internet. One of my favorite things that I've been
[06:43.020 --> 06:49.900]  seeing, and this is a long old school myth that I'm here to dispel today. If you plant your cannabis
[06:49.900 --> 06:56.220]  plants near blueberries or near strawberries, I don't think that's going to make your plants taste
[06:56.220 --> 07:00.460]  like fucking blueberries or strawberries. That is not the trick to get blueberry or strawberry
[07:00.460 --> 07:06.300]  flavored or scented cannabis. That is genetics. That is bread, selectively bread into the cannabis.
[07:06.300 --> 07:10.380]  We find a strain that tastes like strawberries a little bit. We breed that to something else. We
[07:10.380 --> 07:15.020]  find a phenotype that tastes a little bit more strawberry than last time. Then we use that plant
[07:15.020 --> 07:19.340]  and possibly the old strawberry phenotype and breed that. And we get rid of all of the phenotypes
[07:19.340 --> 07:24.700]  that aren't even more strawberry. So we breed that flavor in, or maybe we're breeding it out. We're
[07:24.700 --> 07:30.060]  bringing it out and breeding that for you to have your strawberry or blueberry flavored cannabis.
[07:30.060 --> 07:35.660]  You say that 10 times fast, you'll fuck it up too. It's okay. So the rumor that you can make your herb
[07:35.660 --> 07:40.700]  taste like strawberries or blueberries or apples by growing it near strawberries, blueberries,
[07:40.700 --> 07:46.540]  or apples is very unlikely. It may get a hint of it, maybe possibly, but I don't think it's going
[07:46.540 --> 07:51.900]  to make it have that bold blueberry, strawberry aroma flavor that people want it to have.
[07:51.900 --> 07:56.700]  Also, I don't think feeding your plants juices and shit are going to have the same effect.
[07:56.700 --> 08:00.860]  You're not going to get, if you feed your plants blueberry juice, you're not going to get blueberry
[08:00.860 --> 08:06.380]  flavored buds. That's not a real thing. And here is some evidence to support that. A lot of us feed
[08:06.380 --> 08:12.940]  our plants a lot of really funky flavored and smelling things. People that are running the KNF,
[08:12.940 --> 08:17.900]  the Korean Natural Farming, doing the fermented fruit juices, that stuff doesn't smell like berries
[08:17.900 --> 08:22.860]  and bubble gum. But when they grow their herb, it smells like berries and bubble gum. A lot of
[08:22.860 --> 08:28.620]  people put bat shit, cow shit, horse shit, chicken shit into their herb. It doesn't smell and taste
[08:28.620 --> 08:34.300]  like bat shit, cow shit, goat shit, or chicken shit. So the rumor, the idea, the myth that
[08:34.300 --> 08:39.980]  cannabis will taste like berries should you plant it near berries has just been debunked. Quit saying
[08:39.980 --> 08:45.580]  that shit. All right. The next one I want to debunk today is that you can judge the ripeness
[08:45.580 --> 08:51.900]  of your cannabis plants by the pistils. I hear people, I see people on social media say that you
[08:51.900 --> 08:56.940]  can tell if your plant is done by the hairs. First of all, if you're saying hairs, you're already off
[08:56.940 --> 09:02.620]  on the wrong foot. Those are pistils. Also, those pistils do not indicate ripeness of your cannabis
[09:02.620 --> 09:09.820]  plants in any way. Those are the sex glands of your female plant. Those are there to pick up pollen.
[09:09.820 --> 09:14.940]  They're flapping in the wind. The pollen lands on that, slides down that, ends up in the ovule, then
[09:14.940 --> 09:20.620]  a seed forms inside of there. That has nothing to do, we're not smoking pistils, are we? You don't
[09:20.620 --> 09:25.660]  look at the pistils and go, those are great for smoking. We are smoking trichomes. Why not measure
[09:25.660 --> 09:30.460]  the ripeness of our plant by the thing we are going to consume, the part that contains the
[09:30.460 --> 09:37.740]  active ingredient that we want to consume? We want THC. Why not judge the trichomes by the amount of
[09:37.740 --> 09:45.260]  THC, the ripeness of the THC? In my opinion, judging your plant's ripeness by the pistils or
[09:45.260 --> 09:51.180]  the hairs is like judging the ripeness of an apple by looking at the dirt underneath the tree. It does
[09:51.180 --> 09:56.940]  not do you a bit of fucking good. So you cannot determine the ripeness of your cannabis plants by
[09:56.940 --> 10:01.500]  looking at the pistils. The pistils will change colors if they get sprayed with something. The
[10:01.500 --> 10:06.860]  pistils will change colors if they get too dry. The pistils can change brown and wither up if they
[10:06.860 --> 10:11.500]  get pollinated. The pistils will wither up and dry if you touch them too much. Maybe an insect
[10:11.500 --> 10:18.380]  damaged them. Maybe they got too much sun exposure. Maybe that plant has passed its pollination point
[10:18.380 --> 10:24.060]  and it is no longer able to receive pollen. Those plants only want pollen up till about day 40,
[10:24.060 --> 10:31.660]  but we flower them until about day 65 or 70. So judging by those pistils is a failure to begin
[10:31.660 --> 10:36.700]  with. Stop doing that. You're fucking up. All right. I'm going really fast, but I'm kind of
[10:36.700 --> 10:40.460]  just trying out this new gear. I want to keep moving because what if this doesn't sound really
[10:40.460 --> 10:46.860]  good and I record a really long podcast. So I'm going to move on to the next motherfucking rumor
[10:46.860 --> 10:52.060]  I would like to dispel today on this episode. I'm moving to another page. I've got a couple that I'm
[10:52.060 --> 10:58.700]  trying to save here because I'm doing them in a certain order. You cannot, can not, not, cannot,
[10:58.700 --> 11:08.300]  impossible to visually identify the sex of a cannabis seed by looking at that seed. If that
[11:08.300 --> 11:13.500]  were possible, I would pay you to come sort out all of the male and female seeds from my seed
[11:13.500 --> 11:18.380]  batches. I would keep the males so I could grow nothing but elite males for myself and have killer
[11:18.380 --> 11:22.940]  breeding projects. Then we would sell all of the female seeds. I can guarantee you they were
[11:22.940 --> 11:29.260]  females. Female seeds cost twice as much as non-female seeds, non-feminized seeds. So if you
[11:29.260 --> 11:34.460]  could do that magic trick for me, I would hire you. Unfortunately, that little chart that you
[11:34.460 --> 11:40.060]  see on social media that says if it's got this shape to it or this pointy tip here, this volcano
[11:40.060 --> 11:47.660]  shape here, or an acorn shaped here, that is complete and total motherfucking bullshit,
[11:47.660 --> 11:53.900]  debunked, Rasta Jeff calls bullshit. If you can do it, if you can prove it, come to my spot. I
[11:53.900 --> 11:58.860]  will give you a hundred seeds. I will let you number them. We will label them. We will plant
[11:58.860 --> 12:04.220]  them one through 100. We will veg them until they're two inches tall. Is that two inches? I
[12:04.220 --> 12:07.580]  don't know. We'll veg them until they're three and a half inches tall. That's how tall GI Joe is. Three
[12:07.580 --> 12:11.420]  and three quarters, that's this tall. Judge them till they're as tall as, veg them till they're as
[12:11.420 --> 12:17.260]  tall as GI Joe. Then we're going to flower them. We're going to remember everyone you marked,
[12:17.260 --> 12:20.780]  male and female. We're going to write it down on the container in which that seed is in. We're
[12:20.780 --> 12:26.220]  going to know. I'm going to have documentation. If you're 90% right, I'll be fucking amazed. If
[12:26.220 --> 12:31.660]  you're 70% right, I might still be impressed. 50% is just fucking lucky guesses. You got to be more
[12:31.660 --> 12:37.020]  than 60 or 70%. I doubt you're going to get it right. I have never seen anybody accurately do
[12:37.020 --> 12:41.900]  that. I don't fucking believe it one bit. If you can do it, come on over. I'll fucking pay you.
[12:41.900 --> 12:47.740]  There's a prize involved. You cannot visually identify the sex of seeds by looking at them.
[12:47.740 --> 12:51.260]  People are going to say, what about feminized seeds? That's fucking cheating. I know they're
[12:51.260 --> 12:55.420]  female seeds because I made them. They're feminized. I did that. What if I fuck with
[12:55.420 --> 12:59.500]  you? What if I give you a bunch of seeds and tell you to sex them for me and I put some female seeds
[12:59.500 --> 13:04.380]  in there that I know are fems? The minute I see you say, this one's a boy, you're already wrong.
[13:04.380 --> 13:09.900]  We already know that your whole fucking theory is all fucked up. You cannot identify seeds by
[13:09.900 --> 13:13.900]  looking at them. Where are we? What do we want to go with next? I've got two more big ones that I
[13:13.900 --> 13:18.300]  know are going to let me rant for a couple of seconds. I'm not too far into this podcast.
[13:19.420 --> 13:25.340]  Let's talk about this one. This one just drives me nuts professionally. As an industry, as a
[13:25.340 --> 13:31.100]  community, as a movement, we need to work toward more professionalism. A way we can do that is by
[13:31.100 --> 13:35.980]  using proper terminology. Like I said before, those hairs are called pistols. You already
[13:35.980 --> 13:40.140]  sound more credible, more educated, more advanced if you say pistols and quit saying hairs.
[13:41.260 --> 13:46.140]  Let's work on another word that drives me fucking crazy. If you don't care, that's cool. I just want
[13:46.140 --> 13:49.900]  to give you a heads up if you want to sound a little bit more educated and be taken a little
[13:49.900 --> 13:55.820]  more seriously in the group. Let's talk about the word hermy. Hermy drives me nuts. Hermy's not a
[13:55.820 --> 14:00.780]  fucking word. Hermaphrodite is the word. If you're going to say hermy, just say herm. Don't put the
[14:00.860 --> 14:06.460]  me on there. For some reason, it sounds very juvenile, very elementary school, very playground-ish.
[14:06.460 --> 14:11.500]  Hermy. I don't know. It bothers the fuck out of me. Also, the word isn't hermaphrodite. The word
[14:11.500 --> 14:17.820]  is intersex. If a plant shows male and female sex parts, that plant carries intersex traits.
[14:17.820 --> 14:24.860]  Let's wipe the word hermy out of our vocabulary. No more hermy. Maybe hermaphrodite. Maybe herm
[14:24.860 --> 14:30.860]  if you're typing fast. Let's work on intersex. This plant shows intersex traits. It didn't go
[14:30.860 --> 14:35.740]  herm on you. It showed intersex traits. Now, another thing I want to address that falls
[14:35.740 --> 14:42.700]  right into this category, maybe a subnote of this category, I see people saying that there was a
[14:42.700 --> 14:51.180]  male plant near their plants, and it made their females turn hermaphroditic and seed up. You guys,
[14:52.060 --> 14:57.820]  that is not what's happening. Let's think about basic biology. You've got a male plant. He's got
[14:58.460 --> 15:03.820]  male pollen sacks. You've got a female plant. She's got, what did we talk about earlier, pistils
[15:03.820 --> 15:09.980]  and ovules. Now, how does nature work? What do boys and girls do? They fuck. How does that happen?
[15:09.980 --> 15:16.220]  The pollen, which is basically the sperm, hits the pistil, which takes that pistil to the ovule,
[15:16.220 --> 15:20.140]  which is where babies are made. Just like in nature, bro, it's sperming up the egg.
[15:21.260 --> 15:25.020]  Those plants that you were saying that some people on social media keep saying,
[15:25.020 --> 15:30.300]  my plants were near a male plant and they hermed. Nah, bro. They fucked and your plant's pregnant.
[15:30.300 --> 15:37.500]  It's seeded up. No herming happened. You let a male go, and that male pollinated that female
[15:37.500 --> 15:43.660]  plant. It wasn't a herm. That's nature. That's biology 101. They fucked. All right. I'm going
[15:43.660 --> 15:47.340]  to move on from talking about plants fucking. I'm going to quit saying like that. I'm sure a couple
[15:47.340 --> 15:51.020]  of people threw up in their mouths every time I said that. Let's talk about another thing.
[15:52.780 --> 15:58.460]  The phrase clone only. Now, a lot of people don't even understand what I'm talking about when I say
[15:58.460 --> 16:04.060]  clone only. Let's pick the strain, Gorilla Glue number four. Gorilla Glue number four is a plant
[16:04.060 --> 16:09.340]  that is a clone only. Gorilla Glue four was bred by Josie Wells. Rest in peace, brother Josie
[16:09.340 --> 16:15.660]  Wells. He's no longer with us, but his work lives on forever. Gorilla Glue four is known as number
[16:15.660 --> 16:22.380]  four because there was a batch of seeds. Number four was the prize seedling out of that batch.
[16:22.380 --> 16:27.100]  He probably had, I'm going to assume, since I've seen Gorilla Glue seven, I'm going to assume there
[16:27.100 --> 16:32.460]  were 10 plants. Just guessing, hypothetically, follow me here. We've got 10 plants. Our friend
[16:32.460 --> 16:35.980]  has named them Gorilla Glue. He probably didn't name them until after he smoked them and smelled
[16:35.980 --> 16:42.620]  it. Either way, let's focus on the story. 10 seedlings, grew them out. He realized number four
[16:42.620 --> 16:48.380]  and number seven are the fucking keepers. He smokes them. I'm assuming and making this up,
[16:48.380 --> 16:52.620]  this is my assumption here. Don't fucking criticize me too much, but this is how this works.
[16:53.260 --> 16:58.700]  He smokes them. He realizes this smells or tastes like Gorilla Glue, names it Gorilla Glue,
[16:58.700 --> 17:04.700]  but there are 10 seedlings. They all got numbered Gorilla Glue one through 10. The boys probably
[17:04.700 --> 17:09.340]  got removed. I don't know. They got put in another room. The females got to flower. There's probably
[17:09.340 --> 17:15.260]  five girls, five boys. Just hypothetically, that's how breeding and selecting works. Of those five,
[17:15.260 --> 17:22.300]  there was number four and number seven amongst that five, hypothetically. They got their numbers,
[17:22.300 --> 17:27.820]  their number indications because of the specific phenotype that those plants were from that cross.
[17:28.380 --> 17:37.020]  So, number four, Gorilla Glue number four is a selected cut, which was selected by Josie Wales.
[17:37.020 --> 17:41.900]  It was named Gorilla Glue and the cut was number four because it was probably the fourth plant in
[17:41.900 --> 17:50.860]  the tray. Hence, Gorilla Glue number four. Now, why is it a clone only? Because Josie never put out
[17:50.860 --> 17:57.500]  a male plant of the Gorilla Glue number four. He never released a male. So, it is clone only. There
[17:57.500 --> 18:04.700]  are no unadulterated seeds of Gorilla Glue number four available on the market unless Josie put them
[18:04.700 --> 18:10.940]  out and he did not. And let's talk about that. If he did breed to it, they wouldn't be Gorilla Glue
[18:10.940 --> 18:16.700]  number four seeds. They would be Gorilla Glue number four crossed to something, which would
[18:16.700 --> 18:22.780]  lose the name Gorilla Glue number four. So, let's talk about this in a couple of other terms.
[18:22.780 --> 18:27.660]  If he took a Gorilla Glue, if anybody took a Gorilla Glue number four plant and bred to it,
[18:27.660 --> 18:33.500]  you can make seeds, but they are not Gorilla Glue four. They are now adulterated Gorilla Glue four
[18:33.500 --> 18:40.700]  seeds bred to something. It's Gorilla Glue four X other plant crossed to another plant. The only
[18:40.700 --> 18:48.940]  way it is possible to have pure Gorilla Glue number four seeds is to have S1 feminized Gorilla
[18:48.940 --> 18:54.700]  Glue number four seeds. What that means is we took a Gorilla Glue number four plant, the official
[18:54.700 --> 19:00.940]  clone only plant, the selection that Josie Wales selected himself and labeled number four. You have
[19:00.940 --> 19:06.140]  to take that plant, take two clones of that same plant, treat one with the solution. There are
[19:06.140 --> 19:11.180]  multiple ways to reverse a plant. Of course, I recommend silver thiosulfate. Apply silver
[19:11.180 --> 19:17.020]  thiosulfate to the one plant. It will create pollen sacs. Apply that pollen to the female
[19:17.020 --> 19:25.020]  plant at the right time. Now you have produced Gorilla Glue number four S1 seeds. You have selfed
[19:25.020 --> 19:32.300]  the Gorilla Glue. It is not adulterated. There are no other genetics within that cross. The only way
[19:32.300 --> 19:39.420]  that you can have Gorilla Glue number four seeds is if they are feminized S1s. Otherwise, those
[19:39.420 --> 19:44.540]  seeds people are selling you, giving you, trading to you, offering you are bullshit. That is not
[19:44.540 --> 19:51.500]  Gorilla Glue number four, unless they reversed it and made feminized seeds. Let's talk about this
[19:51.500 --> 19:55.900]  in other terms that may make it more clear for other people. Let's talk about an animal that is
[19:55.900 --> 20:01.580]  nearly extinct. I'm going to create an animal. We're going to call it the purple wombat. There's
[20:01.580 --> 20:07.580]  only one female purple wombat left on the planet. Just one. How are we going to make more?
[20:07.580 --> 20:15.180]  We're not. Because there's only one fucking female. There's no sperm. One purple wombat on the planet.
[20:15.180 --> 20:20.220]  It's a girl. Where are we going to get some sperm from? There are no dudes around. We're not. We're not
[20:20.220 --> 20:26.380]  going to make more purple wombats. That is how biology and breeding work. There's only one female
[20:26.380 --> 20:31.740]  of Gorilla Glue number four. There was never a male released. Josie didn't put out the male. You can't
[20:31.740 --> 20:39.020]  make more unadulterated crosses without the male. That is my rant on clone only. Clone only means
[20:39.020 --> 20:45.500]  that there was never seeds or a male released to make seeds with. Of course, breeders like myself
[20:45.500 --> 20:50.140]  have kind of fucked this all up and started making feminized seeds. Let's talk about golden goat.
[20:50.140 --> 20:55.900]  I did not make golden goat. I need to give a shout out to Dr. Dank, who made the golden goat. Mr. Dank,
[20:55.900 --> 21:01.020]  Dr. Dank. I apologize for getting it wrong on a podcast. Big respect either way. I'm live on the
[21:01.020 --> 21:06.540]  spot trying to keep up with my own brain. Mr. Dank made golden goat. I acquired the golden goat clone.
[21:06.540 --> 21:12.300]  It was a clone only. There is no male of golden goat available. This guy put out the clone of
[21:12.300 --> 21:18.940]  golden goat. Clone only. No seeds, no male plant until I got a hold of it and made that S1. My
[21:18.940 --> 21:23.900]  purpose for making the S1 is because people in other places were seeing my pictures of golden goat
[21:23.900 --> 21:28.540]  and saying, that's fucking amazing. Can I have some of that? I can't really easily ship clones all
[21:28.540 --> 21:34.460]  over the place, but allegedly we can get you seeds all over the world. I made golden goat seeds
[21:34.460 --> 21:39.580]  from a golden goat plant. I took a golden goat, took two clones of it, treated one with silver
[21:39.580 --> 21:44.780]  thiosulfate. It made pollen. I applied that pollen onto a female golden goat, the same plant,
[21:44.780 --> 21:50.860]  just two clones. It's clone only. I'm using the clone. Then I made seeds from that. Those seeds
[21:50.860 --> 21:58.140]  are golden goat S1 feminized seeds. That is the only way you can get pure unadulterated golden
[21:58.140 --> 22:04.300]  goat. Also, I've made a golden goat back cross, which means I took a plant that was very similar
[22:04.300 --> 22:09.100]  to golden goat and crossed it to the golden goat. The offspring looks very much like golden goat.
[22:09.100 --> 22:14.860]  I've talked about my process in that in depth in a couple of episodes, but that is a back cross.
[22:15.260 --> 22:20.620]  Since there is not a male of golden goat available, I had to use a different male to put pollen on
[22:20.620 --> 22:26.940]  that plant to make seeds. That is not pure golden goat. That is a back cross. It's been adulterated.
[22:26.940 --> 22:34.220]  It is my responsibility as a responsible breeder to label that as the back cross, which it is.
[22:34.220 --> 22:40.780]  That is my rant on clone only. That is my rant and my reasoning on why there is no gorilla glue
[22:41.420 --> 22:46.700]  fucking seeds that are not S1s. That's my rant on why there's no golden goat. That's my rant on why
[22:46.700 --> 22:52.860]  there are no Girl Scout cookies. Many of these plants were clone only and there were no options
[22:52.860 --> 22:56.220]  for other seeds. The only person that had the seeds were the guys that made it.
[22:58.140 --> 23:02.540]  Let's say I make a cross. Let's talk about something I'm not going to release. I don't
[23:02.540 --> 23:05.580]  even want to tell you some shit that I've got going on that I'm not going to release.
[23:05.580 --> 23:10.220]  Let's just say that I took a rise and I crossed it to this new blue kombucha bottle. There's a
[23:10.220 --> 23:14.460]  blue kombucha bottle in front of me. That's a new fucking strange name. A rise to blue kombucha
[23:14.460 --> 23:19.420]  bottle. I'm going to grow out 25 seeds of it. I'm going to find the fucking champion female out of
[23:19.420 --> 23:24.380]  there. I've got this amazing arise to blue kombucha female. We're going to call it kombucha rise.
[23:24.380 --> 23:29.740]  That's how my brain works. Kombucha rise. I'm never going to give anybody a seed. I'm going
[23:29.740 --> 23:35.020]  to hoard these seeds. These are mine. Blue kombucha rise seeds all go in my safe. They're locked away.
[23:35.020 --> 23:39.740]  I'm going to forget about them. Maybe I'll lose them. I don't know. They won't germinate. That's
[23:39.740 --> 23:44.700]  it. There's this one plant that I grew. This blue kombucha rise that I selected. I got rid of all
[23:44.700 --> 23:49.740]  the others. They weren't fucking elites. I've got one blue kombucha rise. Make more of that.
[23:50.300 --> 23:55.100]  You can't do it because there's no male. I didn't give anybody any seeds. Maybe I gave you the clone,
[23:55.100 --> 23:59.820]  but I will never give you the seeds. You've got that clone. You can't make more of that unless
[23:59.820 --> 24:07.180]  you adulterate it with other pollen or you self it. That's my rant on clone only Gorilla Glue 4,
[24:07.180 --> 24:12.140]  Girl Scout Cookies. There are a lot of other things out there that are clone only. Blue
[24:12.140 --> 24:16.860]  Dream is clone only. A lot of that popular shit that you guys are really seeking is clone only.
[24:17.660 --> 24:21.980]  Part of why I'm doing this rant is to let you know to be careful. I need to educate you. I want to
[24:21.980 --> 24:26.540]  educate you. Be careful in your quest for seeds. Don't get duped. Don't get ripped off. Don't fall
[24:26.540 --> 24:31.260]  for false labeling. Look for a seed brand, a seed vendor that's been around for a while.
[24:31.260 --> 24:35.660]  I'm not saying only shop with me. There are a lot of people that have been around a lot longer than
[24:35.660 --> 24:40.540]  me that have a lot of other things to offer that I don't offer, but be very careful when you're
[24:40.540 --> 24:46.060]  shopping. If they've got Blue Dream, if they've got Gorilla Glue, if they've got Girl Scout Cookies,
[24:46.060 --> 24:52.060]  and it just says regular seeds and doesn't tell you what it's crossed with, be very leery of those
[24:52.060 --> 24:57.260]  seeds. All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[24:57.260 --> 25:01.900]  smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, skateboarders, seed hoarders,
[25:01.900 --> 25:05.900]  all you bad motherfuckers out there in the cannabis community, a special shout out to all
