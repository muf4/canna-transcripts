[01:39.460 --> 01:41.020]  Where do we go from there?
[01:41.020 --> 01:42.980]  Let's talk about what I got to do this weekend.
[01:42.980 --> 01:46.220]  I went to the museum and it was awesome.
[01:46.220 --> 01:49.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, if you are cannabis consumers, if you'd like to go
[01:49.660 --> 01:52.740]  see cool shit, get blazed and go to the museum.
[01:52.740 --> 01:55.100]  I went to the Museum of Natural Art and Science.
[01:55.100 --> 01:56.300]  I think that's where we went.
[01:56.300 --> 01:58.180]  Museum of Art and Science, some shit like that.
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.300]  It was fucking rad, dude.
[01:59.300 --> 02:00.700]  Go there, go check it out.
[02:00.700 --> 02:04.060]  Go get educated, go get blazed and go see some really great shit.
[02:04.100 --> 02:05.660]  That is my recommendation for the week.
[02:05.660 --> 02:10.540]  All right, I want to focus on talking about the main topic of the podcast, which is one
[02:10.540 --> 02:12.820]  of my new strains called the moon tower.
[02:12.820 --> 02:16.420]  A lot of people know that I am a podcaster, but many people may not know that I am also
[02:16.420 --> 02:17.780]  a seed breeder.
[02:17.780 --> 02:22.980]  I am the head breeder, the sole proprietor for Irie Genetics premium seeds.
[02:22.980 --> 02:25.180]  We make great regular and feminized seeds.
[02:25.180 --> 02:29.940]  We do not make auto flowers, but we are doing a collab with a friend at Night Owl, big up
[02:29.940 --> 02:31.600]  to my buddy, Daz.
[02:31.600 --> 02:32.600]  But we do make seeds.
[02:32.600 --> 02:33.600]  I make seeds.
[02:33.600 --> 02:35.000]  We make a lot of great seeds.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.620]  One of the things I have recently been releasing that went through testing that is now being
[02:38.620 --> 02:42.440]  released to the public is something called the moon tower.
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.060]  Let's focus on the moon tower.
[02:44.060 --> 02:45.160]  What is the moon tower?
[02:45.160 --> 02:52.640]  The parents of the moon tower are a pre-98 Bubba Kush female pollinated by my Arise male,
[02:52.640 --> 02:54.920]  who is also known as King Solomon.
[02:54.920 --> 02:57.240]  Let's talk briefly about the Bubba Kush.
[02:57.240 --> 02:59.080]  Then we'll focus a little bit on Solomon.
[02:59.080 --> 03:02.520]  Then we will move deeply into talking about the moon tower.
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.520]  The pre-98 Bubba Kush, the female plant that makes up this cross, I like that plant.
[03:07.520 --> 03:11.560]  I've loved that plant for a long time since medical cannabis got popular.
[03:11.560 --> 03:17.200]  I've been buying Bubba Kush, pre-98 Bubba Kush from dispensaries, from friends, from
[03:17.200 --> 03:19.760]  any type of grower I can find it from forever.
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.800]  I've had the clone a few times.
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.080]  When I get clones, sometimes I work with them, I breed to them, then I let them go or I grow
[03:25.080 --> 03:27.400]  them for my own personal consumption.
[03:27.400 --> 03:29.220]  Then I'm limited to so many plants.
[03:29.220 --> 03:30.440]  Sometimes I'll just let things go.
[03:30.440 --> 03:34.800]  Over the years, I've gotten my hands on Bubba several times and I've let it go.
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.260]  I've always loved the coffee flavors, the earthy, the dirty kind of notes and tones
[03:40.260 --> 03:42.000]  and flavors and aromas that it creates.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  I love that.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.400]  I also love the buzz.
[03:44.400 --> 03:47.400]  It gives me a really nice heavy eyed buzz.
[03:47.400 --> 03:51.200]  A lot of strains now that I smoke give me like an open bug eyed kind of a thing.
[03:51.200 --> 03:53.400]  The Bubba Kush makes my eyes a little bit heavy.
[03:53.400 --> 03:54.640]  It makes me a little bit lazy.
[03:54.640 --> 03:56.840]  It makes my shoulders kind of relax a little bit.
[03:56.840 --> 03:59.780]  It makes me sit back in the chair instead of the edge of the chair, which is where I
[03:59.780 --> 04:00.780]  usually am.
[04:00.780 --> 04:04.540]  I love the Bubba Kush because it's got that kind of couch lock feeling.
[04:04.540 --> 04:05.540]  It almost sits me down.
[04:05.540 --> 04:06.620]  I'm a hyperactive dude.
[04:06.620 --> 04:09.740]  You can tell by the way I'm talking fucking a million miles an hour right here into the
[04:09.740 --> 04:11.100]  microphone.
[04:11.100 --> 04:12.300]  I go super quickly.
[04:12.300 --> 04:14.780]  When I smoke the Bubba Kush, it will chill me out.
[04:14.780 --> 04:16.380]  It's good for nighttime smoke for me.
[04:16.380 --> 04:19.020]  It's good for if I'm hanging out with the lady and I'm too talkative and she wants to
[04:19.020 --> 04:21.100]  watch a movie, smoke that Bubba Kush.
[04:21.100 --> 04:23.300]  It'll calm me right down, get into the mode for a movie.
[04:23.300 --> 04:27.420]  If I got to do some emails or some work and I'm too hyper, that will chill me out.
[04:27.420 --> 04:28.500]  I love the Bubba Kush.
[04:28.500 --> 04:33.220]  Couch lock, relaxation, plus the coffee, the dirt, the earthy tones.
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.700]  Beautiful, beautiful cannabis.
[04:34.700 --> 04:35.700]  It grows very well.
[04:35.700 --> 04:37.540]  There's not a problem with the way it grows.
[04:37.540 --> 04:38.540]  It grows like a Kush.
[04:38.540 --> 04:39.740]  It grows a little bit stretchy.
[04:39.740 --> 04:43.900]  It could be better, but there's not a huge problem with the way that it grows.
[04:43.900 --> 04:46.660]  Now let's talk about King Solomon.
[04:46.660 --> 04:50.580]  King Solomon, again, is an F1 male.
[04:50.580 --> 04:51.580]  Let's say that again.
[04:51.580 --> 04:54.380]  King Solomon is an Arise F1 male.
[04:54.380 --> 04:56.380]  So I crossed the Golden Goat and Daybreaker.
[04:56.620 --> 04:59.340]  It was a Golden Goat female, a Daybreaker male.
[04:59.340 --> 05:01.860]  Put that Daybreaker male pollen on the Golden Goat.
[05:01.860 --> 05:03.500]  That made my Arise.
[05:03.500 --> 05:07.820]  From that first batch of seeds, I found a dude that is ... He's a stud.
[05:07.820 --> 05:08.820]  He's a winner.
[05:08.820 --> 05:09.820]  He's a champion.
[05:09.820 --> 05:13.820]  He's proven himself to be a winner because I've crossed him to hundreds of females probably.
[05:13.820 --> 05:15.700]  We'll say at least 100 females.
[05:15.700 --> 05:19.140]  I've grown probably 70 of them or somebody's grown 70 of them.
[05:19.140 --> 05:23.780]  They all probably say 60 to 65 of them were quite stellar.
[05:23.780 --> 05:25.100]  They do perform quite well.
[05:25.140 --> 05:26.900]  King Solomon is a stud.
[05:26.900 --> 05:28.500]  There are a few that don't work super great.
[05:28.500 --> 05:29.700]  Some of those won't be released.
[05:29.700 --> 05:32.100]  Some of them aren't amazing, but that's not the point here.
[05:32.100 --> 05:34.180]  Let's focus on King Solomon.
[05:34.180 --> 05:39.080]  When I breed with King Solomon, I know that he is going to improve anything that I put
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.080]  his pollen on.
[05:40.080 --> 05:42.080]  He will make things more potent.
[05:42.080 --> 05:44.000]  He will make things grow with more vigor.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.140]  He seems to be the improver or the fixer plant is what I know him as.
[05:48.140 --> 05:52.200]  Once again, he is a Golden Goat female pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[05:52.300 --> 05:56.000]  Let's talk briefly about Daybreaker because that will come into play here.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.800]  Daybreaker is a Chem D to Joseph OG cross.
[05:59.800 --> 06:05.720]  You got that Chem Dog, the Chem D, that cushy chemical sort of a smell over here, and Joseph
[06:05.720 --> 06:08.640]  OG, which is swampy, just cushy.
[06:08.640 --> 06:10.760]  If you know what cush smells like, it's straight up cush.
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.440]  That is what cush smells like.
[06:12.440 --> 06:15.760]  You got Joseph, you got Chem, and then they cross that.
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.580]  Then I put that to the Golden Goat.
[06:17.580 --> 06:23.460]  That gave us kind of a sweet, cushy, Chem, dirty feet, sweet feet sort of a flavor.
[06:23.460 --> 06:26.940]  Somebody took the Chem D and crossed it to the Joseph OG.
[06:26.940 --> 06:28.180]  That made the Daybreaker.
[06:28.180 --> 06:32.020]  I took the Daybreaker male, pollinated the Golden Goat female.
[06:32.020 --> 06:37.700]  That made sort of a tropical fruit, sweet, cushy, dirty feet aroma sort of a plant.
[06:37.700 --> 06:39.940]  Those plants were labeled Arise.
[06:39.940 --> 06:43.800]  From that batch of seeds was a male who has been labeled Solomon.
[06:43.800 --> 06:44.800]  That is King Solomon.
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.480]  He grows with those sweet, Chem-y flavors, aromas, hyper vigor, super potency, and he's
[06:50.480 --> 06:52.360]  also resistant to problems.
[06:52.360 --> 06:54.820]  He can handle a lot of stress.
[06:54.820 --> 06:57.060]  Why did I want to cross these two plants?
[06:57.060 --> 06:58.060]  That's always important.
[06:58.060 --> 07:01.840]  I say when you're breeding, have a goal, have something in mind.
[07:01.840 --> 07:07.040]  Honestly, the thing that really got me excited about this was these are two of my favorite
[07:07.040 --> 07:08.040]  strains.
[07:08.040 --> 07:09.040]  I've always loved the Bubba Cush.
[07:09.040 --> 07:10.640]  It's been a favorite of mine for quite a while.
[07:10.640 --> 07:12.160]  I've always loved King Solomon.
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.200]  Obviously, he's done a lot of great work for me.
[07:14.600 --> 07:18.000]  I had an opportunity to put them both in the same area and breed to them.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.920]  I thought, why would I miss this opportunity?
[07:20.920 --> 07:23.280]  As I was doing it, I thought, what am I going to create here?
[07:23.280 --> 07:25.120]  I thought I wanted to create that.
[07:25.120 --> 07:29.800]  I wanted to keep the coffee and earth flavor, add some sweetener to it, just a little bit
[07:29.800 --> 07:34.680]  of sweetness to it, but then try to hype up the growth time because the Arise grows super
[07:34.680 --> 07:37.280]  quickly to where it cuts down the veg time of some plants.
[07:37.280 --> 07:39.720]  When I breed it to things, it vegs more quickly.
[07:39.720 --> 07:44.920]  I was hoping to make the Bubba Cush veg more quickly and keep that sweet Cush flavor, add
[07:44.920 --> 07:48.320]  a little sweetness to it, at the same time, add a little bit of potency.
[07:48.320 --> 07:53.880]  It was honestly my main goal, the main idea when making this cross.
[07:53.880 --> 07:59.440]  The results actually were, I wrote this down, coffee, earth, fuel, and funk flavors.
[07:59.440 --> 08:05.640]  Then we get medium height plants with tight internodal spacing and long lateral branching.
[08:05.640 --> 08:09.800]  That means that the plants, in my opinion, in my experience, what I've seen from testers
[08:09.800 --> 08:14.520]  is the plants, they'll grow tall, but the internodal spacing will be tight together.
[08:14.520 --> 08:18.480]  Those branches that come from those nodes get really, really long is something that
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.280]  I'm noticing.
[08:20.280 --> 08:25.440]  We've got medium height plants with tight internodal spacing and long lateral branching.
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.560]  We're talking about how it grows and its growth structures and features.
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.400]  Moved on from that flavor and aroma profile, talking more about the growth features.
[08:33.400 --> 08:37.960]  If you don't top these plants, or yeah, if you don't top them, they will make one giant
[08:37.960 --> 08:38.960]  cola.
[08:38.960 --> 08:39.960]  They'll make one big bud.
[08:39.960 --> 08:40.960]  You'll get a lot of branching coming up.
[08:40.960 --> 08:45.440]  It'll make a lot of nice side buds, but then you'll get one big donkey dick bud right up
[08:45.440 --> 08:47.320]  the middle if you don't top it.
[08:47.320 --> 08:49.160]  If you do top it, it'll make it spread out.
[08:49.160 --> 08:51.040]  I recommend topping low.
[08:51.040 --> 08:54.980]  A lot of people top when there's that one V section that's only a few inches apart.
[08:54.980 --> 09:00.600]  Go down one or two more nodes lower, top it there, veg a little bit longer, let it recover,
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.560]  let it kind of even out a little bit, then you'll get a lot more from it, in my experience
[09:04.560 --> 09:05.960]  with this plant.
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.840]  So they take off, they stretch early in flower.
[09:09.840 --> 09:14.080]  Some phenotypes will double in height before they are done.
[09:14.080 --> 09:18.520]  A lot of phenotypes have the potential to become double in height before they are done
[09:18.520 --> 09:19.520]  flowering.
[09:19.520 --> 09:22.040]  So if you've got a two-foot flowering space, flower at a foot.
[09:22.040 --> 09:25.200]  Allow for pot space, allow for light space, but you understand what I'm saying.
[09:25.200 --> 09:28.600]  If you flower at 12 inches, they will finish at 24 inches.
[09:28.600 --> 09:30.880]  So be prepared for that sort of a thing.
[09:30.880 --> 09:34.560]  They do take off and stretch a little bit in early flower.
[09:34.560 --> 09:36.600]  That is something I recommend you be prepared for.
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.020]  If you were growing the moon tower, it will get stretchy for you early in flower.
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.020]  So be prepared.
[09:43.020 --> 09:44.520]  Some of those phenotypes are going to get tall.
[09:44.520 --> 09:46.880]  We'll talk about how to take care of that here in just a little bit.
[09:46.880 --> 09:49.840]  I do have some notes I should try to stay on track of.
[09:49.840 --> 09:51.040]  Let's talk about phenotypes.
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.200]  Let's see some of the phenotypes that I'm experiencing and that test growers have seen
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.400]  through the populations of moon tower.
[09:59.200 --> 10:01.600]  I see a structure, the same structure across most of these plants.
[10:01.600 --> 10:05.560]  It is the same shape, the same structure that is happening in most environments and from
[10:05.560 --> 10:07.440]  most phenotypes.
[10:07.440 --> 10:11.000]  They get tall and they've got that long branchy structure.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.360]  The main difference in structure that I'm seeing is depending on your light, depending
[10:16.360 --> 10:21.720]  on your environment, people are getting different stretch space in that inner node spacing.
[10:21.720 --> 10:25.880]  If you don't have a lot of light, if you pack the plants in too closely, also if you put
[10:25.880 --> 10:29.760]  them in too small of a pot and they get root bound, they do get a little more stretchy.
[10:29.760 --> 10:34.700]  But when all things are good, when the lights, the air, water, soil, the spacing is all correct,
[10:34.700 --> 10:38.320]  they do stay pretty squat, not squat, they stay tight, not squat.
[10:38.320 --> 10:39.320]  Tight is the word.
[10:39.320 --> 10:40.640]  The node spacing is tight.
[10:40.640 --> 10:42.560]  So that's something I've noticed.
[10:42.560 --> 10:44.920]  That one tall structure is very common.
[10:44.920 --> 10:46.440]  They get long branches.
[10:46.440 --> 10:49.740]  The long branches, however, do fill in with giant colas.
[10:49.740 --> 10:51.320]  They will also need support.
[10:51.320 --> 10:53.020]  I recommend a support for the top.
[10:53.020 --> 10:55.380]  If you leave it there, a lot of people are going to cut it out.
[10:55.380 --> 10:57.960]  But I do recommend supports for the taller branches.
[10:57.960 --> 10:59.820]  I like a trellis net.
[10:59.820 --> 11:03.240]  Trellis makes it super easy for me to do what I like to do in the grow.
[11:03.240 --> 11:04.860]  Some of you like to move the plants around.
[11:04.860 --> 11:06.100]  That may not work for you.
[11:06.100 --> 11:08.000]  I may recommend sticks, but be careful.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.700]  The sticks will get in your eye.
[11:09.700 --> 11:10.700]  Those are dangerous.
[11:10.700 --> 11:12.220]  Maybe a tomato cage is better for you.
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.700]  There are a lot of ways to do that.
[11:13.700 --> 11:17.160]  But a trellis net is my ideal situation.
[11:17.160 --> 11:20.900]  Sometimes I use three nets of trellis in a commercial environment.
[11:20.900 --> 11:22.140]  So the plants start growing up.
[11:22.140 --> 11:25.860]  As soon as they start growing toward that trellis, I'll top them and then spread them
[11:25.860 --> 11:27.180]  out and let them grow into it.
[11:27.180 --> 11:28.500]  They'll get a little bit taller up.
[11:28.500 --> 11:30.300]  I'll spread them out a little bit more.
[11:30.300 --> 11:33.540]  That third one is just to guide those buds straight up to the sky to where they know
[11:33.540 --> 11:34.540]  where to go.
[11:34.540 --> 11:38.520]  Then I defoliate everything below that first net of trellis.
[11:38.520 --> 11:40.300]  Three layers in a commercial grow.
[11:40.300 --> 11:45.700]  The main things you guys will see in my experience of differences in phenotypes is going to be
[11:45.700 --> 11:49.060]  leaf, shape, and bud structure.
[11:49.060 --> 11:53.180]  It's going to be the most obvious visual determination of different phenotypes.
[11:53.180 --> 11:57.640]  Now that skinnier leaf pheno, in my opinion, is like cush and coffee.
[11:57.640 --> 11:59.460]  That's kind of what I was breeding for.
[11:59.460 --> 12:05.460]  It's got that cush, earthy coffee flavor, but then it's also got that cush buzz that
[12:05.460 --> 12:07.420]  like sits you down, chills you out.
[12:07.420 --> 12:11.100]  But then there's also something in it that's got some caffeine or some energy to it.
[12:11.100 --> 12:15.260]  It's like, I'd like to sit here and fuck around, but I got to go do something, but I'm so high,
[12:15.260 --> 12:17.420]  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
[12:17.420 --> 12:18.420]  Kind of gives me that feeling.
[12:18.780 --> 12:19.780]  I like it.
[12:19.780 --> 12:21.060]  A lot of people, it may drive you crazy.
[12:21.060 --> 12:22.380]  It's got some motivation to it.
[12:22.380 --> 12:25.700]  It's got some kick and some arise intensity to it.
[12:25.700 --> 12:28.100]  The cush buzz comes through most of the phenotypes.
[12:28.100 --> 12:32.020]  You're going to get that cushy feeling, that like chilled out, relaxed sort of a feeling
[12:32.020 --> 12:33.940]  that's going to come through most of the phenotypes.
[12:33.940 --> 12:37.540]  Those skinnier leaf phenotypes, however, are going to have a little bit of a head ring
[12:37.540 --> 12:41.000]  to them, possibly a little bit of a caffeinated feeling to it.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.700]  That does come from the golden goat side of things.
[12:44.700 --> 12:47.520]  Now the bud structure on some will be tighter than others.
[12:47.620 --> 12:53.920]  In my opinion, the less dense phenotypes are excellent for concentrate makers.
[12:53.920 --> 12:57.480]  If you don't have that super tight bud, I think you can make a better concentrate.
[12:57.480 --> 13:01.600]  I believe the dense buds are great for bag appeal and smoking, but extracting, in my
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.560]  opinion, my experience from what my friends tell me, extracting a less dense product is
[13:06.560 --> 13:08.000]  easier.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.600]  There's more room for trichomes on that.
[13:09.600 --> 13:13.400]  If you've got like a bud that's kind of airy, kind of fingery, imagine if we took a cush
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.120]  nugget that's super tight and like a haze nugget that's got fingers and we rolled them
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.760]  both around in powdered sugar.
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.000]  I'm showing my hands to the camera for everybody that's listening on Spotify or anywhere else.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.760]  If you look at my two hands, I got a fist.
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.600]  How much I can cover my fist, the outer of my fist with powdered sugar if I'm sweaty.
[13:30.600 --> 13:34.280]  If I open up my hand, I got the inside of my hand between my fingers, all of this I
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.000]  can coat in powdered sugar or trichomes if that were a nugget.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.320]  So I believe sometimes if you're going for concentrate, sometimes those more airy, fingery
[13:42.320 --> 13:45.460]  buds are good for the concentrate making.
[13:45.500 --> 13:48.980]  So the tighter buds obviously are more cush leaning.
[13:48.980 --> 13:52.500]  Those come from more of the cush chem side of the genetics.
[13:52.500 --> 13:58.380]  The more fingery buds are more from the golden goat, the Romulan, the Hawaiian sativa side
[13:58.380 --> 14:00.500]  of the genetics in there.
[14:00.500 --> 14:06.420]  Those are going to be more of the head ringer, the head buzz, the psychedelic feeling, the
[14:06.420 --> 14:08.660]  where the hell are my keys while I'm driving my car?
[14:08.660 --> 14:10.940]  Where are my sunglasses while they're on my face?
[14:10.940 --> 14:15.320]  I lost my phone while I'm playing on Instagram, that kind of a buzz.
[14:16.180 --> 14:19.360]  Those come from the skinnier leaf shape buds.
[14:19.360 --> 14:23.200]  That feeling is going to come from those long skinny leaves and kind of even the more airy
[14:23.200 --> 14:24.200]  buds.
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.360]  So the longer and skinnier the leaf, the more airy the bud, of course, the more head ringer
[14:28.360 --> 14:32.900]  of a buzz I believe you're going to get from those plants.
[14:32.900 --> 14:37.520]  So use that leaf shape, use that leaf, that bud density to help you determine kind of
[14:37.520 --> 14:39.700]  which phenotype that you have got.
[14:39.700 --> 14:44.200]  But most importantly, the most important part when it comes to phenotype selection, I talk
[14:44.200 --> 14:46.040]  a lot about which phenotypes you will see.
[14:46.040 --> 14:49.040]  I'm telling you, you're going to see one with long skinny leaves, one with a little bit
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.120]  wider leaf, one with tight, tight buds, one that's a little bit fluffier.
[14:53.120 --> 14:56.880]  Then you're going to get different combos of those buds and leaves together.
[14:56.880 --> 15:00.040]  But it doesn't matter to me which phenotype you find.
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.840]  That may sound rude, as long as you find the one that works the best for you.
[15:03.840 --> 15:06.320]  I've described a lot of phenos and then people email me.
[15:06.320 --> 15:09.440]  They're like, how do I find the phenotype that you call the mean girl?
[15:09.440 --> 15:11.800]  How do I find the phenotype that you called the fat girl?
[15:11.800 --> 15:12.800]  How do I find that?
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.720]  And I say just grow it and honestly look for the best phenotype in your garden.
[15:16.720 --> 15:18.880]  You don't have to have the one that I like the most.
[15:18.880 --> 15:23.400]  I like weed that makes me fucking panic attack while I'm sitting at a table by myself.
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.240]  I like to just freak myself out by taking a dab like, oh shit, what's going on?
[15:27.240 --> 15:28.240]  That's my favorite feeling.
[15:28.240 --> 15:29.680]  That might not be for you.
[15:29.680 --> 15:31.640]  You might want to smoke and lay down and take a nap.
[15:31.640 --> 15:32.820]  That's not what I'm trying to do.
[15:32.820 --> 15:36.720]  So find the phenotype that does the thing that you need done from it.
[15:36.720 --> 15:38.960]  The one that grows the best in your garden.
[15:38.960 --> 15:39.960]  You've got to grow it.
[15:39.960 --> 15:40.960]  You've got to manage it.
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.600]  You're going to have it for nine weeks in flower, four ish, six ish weeks in veg, two
[15:45.600 --> 15:47.040]  weeks as a clone.
[15:47.040 --> 15:52.040]  You're dealing with this plant for fucking 15, 16, 20 weeks, 120 days ish.
[15:52.040 --> 15:54.640]  Make sure it's something you want to grow again.
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.360]  Also find the phenotype that is something you want to smoke or if you're selling it
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.680]  or profiting from it or using it as medicine, make sure it's the thing that works for that.
[16:02.680 --> 16:07.280]  So choose the one that works for you in your environment, for your wallet, for your budget,
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.360]  for your clientele, whatever you need it to.
[16:09.360 --> 16:11.200]  There may be a totally different phenotype than me.
[16:11.200 --> 16:14.080]  I'm not worried about making money off of the flowers I grow.
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.520]  I'm going to smoke all of them or I'm going to pollinate them and make seeds.
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.340]  So my grow and your grow are focused on two totally different things.
[16:21.340 --> 16:24.920]  Find the phenotype that works the best for you.
[16:24.920 --> 16:29.600]  Now I'm going to go back talking about phenotypes because there is one, one anomaly out of,
[16:29.600 --> 16:31.720]  I talk about most of them are going to get tall.
[16:31.720 --> 16:33.380]  Most of them have that long branching.
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.600]  Most of them have tight internodal spacing.
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.880]  There is one however that just loves to fuck with you because that's how genetics work.
[16:39.880 --> 16:43.140]  That is a short squat, runt looking plant.
[16:43.140 --> 16:44.260]  It doesn't look desirable.
[16:44.260 --> 16:46.380]  It doesn't look like it's going to be any good.
[16:46.380 --> 16:47.960]  It looks like it's going to suck.
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.560]  But if you finish that plant out and flower it and let it go, it's full 67, 72 ish day
[16:53.560 --> 16:55.560]  term that it needs to go.
[16:55.560 --> 16:59.080]  That plant will punch you in the face like Mike Tyson.
[16:59.080 --> 17:01.100]  It is like cinder blocks to the head.
[17:01.100 --> 17:02.880]  It is like cement shoes.
[17:02.880 --> 17:03.880]  It's like, I don't know.
[17:03.880 --> 17:05.000]  It's like some sort of medicine.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.280]  It will put you down.
[17:06.280 --> 17:08.700]  That shit will just lay you out.
[17:08.700 --> 17:11.740]  It is such good medicine, but you don't get a lot of it.
[17:11.740 --> 17:13.180]  It doesn't look pretty.
[17:13.180 --> 17:18.240]  It smells like dirty ass skunks and it takes you two hits to go full retard from smoking
[17:18.240 --> 17:19.240]  it.
[17:19.240 --> 17:21.840]  But you don't get a lot of it and it doesn't look super good.
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.700]  So if you're growing it just for yourself, if you just want to smoke it for you, there's
[17:25.700 --> 17:29.120]  a little shitty rump plant that may pop up in a pack of, I don't know.
[17:29.120 --> 17:32.000]  I found it like two or three times out of a lot of seeds.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.960]  Not a lot of the testers have reported it.
[17:33.960 --> 17:37.080]  But if you get that one, finish it out, get a clone of it.
[17:37.080 --> 17:38.800]  It's hard to get a clone because it stays so little.
[17:38.800 --> 17:40.240]  It doesn't grow very big.
[17:40.240 --> 17:42.800]  You got to veg it for a real long time and treat it like a baby.
[17:42.800 --> 17:47.000]  But the medicine that comes from that, the buds from that, it is worth the extra effort
[17:47.000 --> 17:48.000]  and the work.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.720]  If you're going to sell it, if you're doing a commercial grow, that's not the one for
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  you.
[17:51.720 --> 17:54.080]  If it's for your bag, for your head, for your jar, grow that one.
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.360]  If you've got it just over there in the corner of the room, finish that bad bitch out because
[17:57.360 --> 17:59.280]  it is worth it one time.
[17:59.280 --> 18:00.580]  Maybe don't take a clone.
[18:00.580 --> 18:02.760]  Maybe just growing it the one time, see what it does.
[18:02.760 --> 18:03.760]  All right.
[18:04.560 --> 18:05.560]  So we've talked about the phenotypes.
[18:05.560 --> 18:06.560]  We've talked about terps, flavors.
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.000]  I've talked a lot about the feelings and buzz that this plant gives me.
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.800]  Let's talk about a few of the grow features and tips that I can give you for this plant.
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.880]  I really think that the Moontower works very good in a screen of green environment when
[18:19.880 --> 18:21.360]  you trellis them down with the net.
[18:21.360 --> 18:22.600]  They enjoy that.
[18:22.600 --> 18:27.080]  They also work well in a sea of green environment because they grow that one big, tall, apical
[18:27.080 --> 18:28.440]  dominant cola.
[18:28.440 --> 18:30.600]  If you veg them until they're, what is this?
[18:30.600 --> 18:31.600]  What is it?
[18:31.600 --> 18:32.600]  Eight, 10 inches tall.
[18:32.600 --> 18:35.920]  So you veg them until about 10 inches tall, cut off all the bottom branching and flip
[18:35.920 --> 18:36.920]  them.
[18:36.920 --> 18:38.920]  You'll just end up with a bunch of nice main colas.
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.920]  You got to run a lot of them real close together.
[18:40.920 --> 18:44.800]  Of course, if you're going to do that method, don't expect a huge harvest from each one.
[18:44.800 --> 18:46.500]  That's when we do a sea of green.
[18:46.500 --> 18:50.520]  That's when you do like 64 of them on a three by three table and eight by eight square on
[18:50.520 --> 18:51.720]  a three by three table.
[18:51.720 --> 18:52.860]  Lots of plants.
[18:52.860 --> 18:56.360]  If you're in a state where your numbers are regulated, that is not the way to go, but
[18:56.360 --> 18:58.480]  the plants will enjoy doing that.
[18:58.480 --> 19:05.360]  I always recommend with the moon tower, cleaning up the branches, but not completely removing
[19:05.360 --> 19:06.400]  the entire branch.
[19:06.400 --> 19:08.280]  We do a lot of lollipopping.
[19:08.280 --> 19:12.160]  We do a lot of leg shaving, a lot of cleaning up of the bottom of the plant in my school
[19:12.160 --> 19:15.360]  of thought, in my training camp, in my facilities, in my grow.
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.680]  However, I wouldn't cut off all of the branching at the bottom of the moon tower.
[19:19.680 --> 19:24.160]  I may leave more branching than usual and instead of cutting that off, I would kind
[19:24.160 --> 19:27.800]  of strip the bottom half or two thirds of that branch.
[19:28.120 --> 19:30.280]  Clean that right up to where the bottom is naked.
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.280]  You can see their legs for a far way up, but when you get up to the top of the skirt, you're
[19:34.280 --> 19:36.800]  just going to grow big long buds.
[19:36.800 --> 19:42.560]  Leave a nice section up at the top and have a naked tip or a naked leg, nice tip, and
[19:42.560 --> 19:45.200]  that'll grow nice big donkey buds at the end of that.
[19:45.200 --> 19:50.360]  Clean it up and then leave the end of it, enough at the end to make you a nice fat cola.
[19:50.360 --> 19:52.000]  All that space should fill in.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.800]  Generally a cush plant is going to make a bunch of golf balls, but what the Arise has
[19:55.800 --> 20:00.280]  done, the Arise makes that bud stack up a little bit better and fill in all of that
[20:00.280 --> 20:01.280]  space.
[20:01.280 --> 20:04.920]  Another thing I should mention, don't overwater the moon tower plants.
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.960]  They don't like being overwatered.
[20:06.960 --> 20:11.240]  They may survive better if you underwater them than they would if you overwater them.
[20:11.240 --> 20:13.000]  That has been my experience.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.280]  That's what I have noticed.
[20:14.280 --> 20:16.780]  They do eat moderately heavy.
[20:16.780 --> 20:21.960]  So if you are used to feeding a plant a certain diet, maybe step it up just a little bit higher.
[20:21.960 --> 20:25.080]  Now let's talk about some of the things you may want to feed them.
[20:25.080 --> 20:27.280]  They do love the cow mag.
[20:27.280 --> 20:30.840]  And when you feed a cow mag, it makes the leaves kind of get the serrations.
[20:30.840 --> 20:32.400]  They pop up a little bit.
[20:32.400 --> 20:35.080]  They love that and they look super good for photos.
[20:35.080 --> 20:38.220]  The plants do like a low pH toward the end of flower.
[20:38.220 --> 20:39.480]  That will increase your colors.
[20:39.480 --> 20:41.360]  Once again, help you for photos.
[20:41.360 --> 20:45.240]  Low temps at night will help your photos make a change a little bit of color.
[20:45.240 --> 20:47.640]  They will tolerate that cold quite well.
[20:47.640 --> 20:49.680]  They do like kelp products.
[20:49.680 --> 20:54.260]  Kelp products will help your flavors, aromas, and bud density.
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.380]  One thing I noticed, they responded very well to a product called BudSwell.
[20:58.380 --> 20:59.820]  I fed them BudSwell.
[20:59.820 --> 21:00.980]  They did exactly that.
[21:00.980 --> 21:01.980]  They swole up.
[21:01.980 --> 21:02.980]  They got fat.
[21:02.980 --> 21:03.980]  They got beefy.
[21:03.980 --> 21:05.540]  So that seemed to work.
[21:05.540 --> 21:10.700]  One thing I want to mention, these plants do have a tendency to just go yellow around
[21:10.700 --> 21:15.740]  week eight, right around the end of week eight, day 56, day 59, day 60.
[21:15.740 --> 21:18.620]  They're just going to go wonk and turn yellow on you.
[21:18.620 --> 21:19.620]  Don't be afraid.
[21:19.620 --> 21:20.620]  That is not a problem.
[21:20.620 --> 21:23.000]  That is just a sign of, hey, we're done.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.020]  It's almost time to harvest.
[21:24.780 --> 21:27.940]  If you haven't started flushing, if you do that, now it may be time to flush.
[21:27.940 --> 21:31.340]  If you do the 18-6 light switch, now it may be time to do that.
[21:31.340 --> 21:32.420]  These plants are very cool.
[21:32.420 --> 21:35.060]  They let you know, they're like, hey, bro, we're almost done.
[21:35.060 --> 21:37.940]  It's time to go ahead and start wrapping it up, get ready for harvest time.
[21:37.940 --> 21:39.420]  So if they turn yellow, that is fine.
[21:39.420 --> 21:41.320]  I don't think you did anything wrong.
[21:41.320 --> 21:43.260]  That is a common issue that happens with these plants.
[21:43.260 --> 21:45.040]  I don't even guess it's an issue.
[21:45.040 --> 21:46.900]  It's just a trait that happens within these plants.
[21:46.900 --> 21:48.620]  It goes, hey, bro, time to cut us down.
[21:48.620 --> 21:49.620]  And they let you know.
[21:49.620 --> 21:50.620]  The leaves will just turn yellow.
[21:50.620 --> 21:52.300]  Some of the big leaves will fall right off for you.
[21:52.300 --> 21:54.060]  They start pre-trimming themselves.
[21:54.060 --> 21:56.140]  I've gotten that report from a lot of test growers.
[21:56.140 --> 21:59.780]  I've seen it amongst a lot of phenotypes that I grew.
[21:59.780 --> 22:00.780]  Don't freak out.
[22:00.780 --> 22:05.100]  They're almost done, and they're just letting you know that it is almost time for their
[22:05.100 --> 22:06.100]  haircut.
[22:06.100 --> 22:09.140]  I'm scrolling through my notes to see where I am.
[22:09.140 --> 22:10.260]  They did like the bud swell.
[22:10.260 --> 22:11.260]  I mentioned that.
[22:11.260 --> 22:12.780]  They liked bud swell a lot.
[22:12.780 --> 22:17.100]  They really seemed to take well to that bud swell, that organic bat guano liquid nutrient
[22:17.100 --> 22:19.260]  made them swell up, made them get super beefy.
[22:19.260 --> 22:20.780]  I watched them swell.
[22:20.780 --> 22:22.220]  I've grown a couple of batches of this.
[22:22.260 --> 22:23.940]  I've seen other people grow it.
[22:23.940 --> 22:28.940]  People that did not use bud swell did not get the swell that I saw my plants get.
[22:28.940 --> 22:29.940]  Where are we?
[22:29.940 --> 22:31.380]  Some of these plants can be challenging to clone.
[22:31.380 --> 22:33.180]  I'm not sure why they don't like to clone well.
[22:33.180 --> 22:34.980]  The pre-98 Bubba Kush clones well.
[22:34.980 --> 22:36.420]  King Solomon clones well.
[22:36.420 --> 22:39.100]  I don't know where the problematic cloning came from.
[22:39.100 --> 22:42.980]  What I've discovered, what I've learned to realize is if you don't feed these plants
[22:42.980 --> 22:45.580]  for three to four days, they will clone better.
[22:45.580 --> 22:49.460]  So when you're going to take clones of the moon tower, make sure the mother plant has
[22:49.460 --> 22:51.360]  been starved for a couple of days.
[22:51.500 --> 22:53.600]  This is common amongst most cannabis plants.
[22:53.600 --> 22:57.880]  If you overfeed them nitrogen, if they're high in nitrogen when you cut clones, it does
[22:57.880 --> 22:59.400]  slow down the rooting time.
[22:59.400 --> 23:00.880]  So make them a little bit hungry.
[23:00.880 --> 23:03.680]  That will speed up your rooting process.
[23:03.680 --> 23:05.000]  Everything else is fairly easy.
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  They root well.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.200]  They'll get kind of tall.
[23:07.200 --> 23:08.800]  It's going to be your main thing to think about.
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.280]  You're going to have to be prepared for tall plants, but they should be fairly easy for
[23:13.280 --> 23:14.280]  most growers.
[23:14.280 --> 23:16.040]  You shouldn't experience too much problems.
[23:16.040 --> 23:17.440]  You shouldn't get too much trouble.
[23:17.440 --> 23:18.840]  Don't overwater.
[23:18.840 --> 23:20.000]  Keep an eye on the feeding.
[23:20.040 --> 23:24.080]  The next thing should be Cool Feeder, a moderately high nitrogen diet.
[23:24.080 --> 23:29.840]  So if you feed your plants however many ppms of nitrogen now, maybe increase that by 10%,
[23:29.840 --> 23:32.120]  20% and pay attention to these plants.
[23:32.120 --> 23:34.400]  These plants are hungry bitches and they will eat.
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.280]  I don't want to tell you to super feed it because then you're going to go pounding it
[23:37.280 --> 23:38.920]  with too much nutrients.
[23:38.920 --> 23:42.180]  Here's something I would recommend that you do consider.
[23:42.180 --> 23:43.240]  This is not instruction.
[23:43.240 --> 23:44.360]  None of this is instruction.
[23:44.360 --> 23:46.520]  This is all recommendation from a friend here.
[23:46.520 --> 23:52.160]  I would consider when you flip to flower, so you go from your veg phase, you turn your
[23:52.160 --> 23:54.360]  lights to 12, 12, you are now in flower.
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.720]  Day one starts when you flip the lights.
[23:56.720 --> 24:00.960]  Most people will now switch from their vegetative to their flowering nutrients.
[24:00.960 --> 24:05.840]  At this time, I would recommend you go two more weeks with your vegetative nutrients
[24:05.840 --> 24:10.680]  with this strain because these plants do eat a lot of nitrogen and they will need that
[24:10.680 --> 24:12.200]  extra nitrogen built up.
[24:12.200 --> 24:14.040]  This will help you out in my opinion.
[24:14.040 --> 24:16.120]  This works for a lot of plants.
[24:16.120 --> 24:21.400]  Maybe taper off that veg feed into your bloom feed over the next two week period, but adjust
[24:21.400 --> 24:22.400]  that slowly.
[24:22.400 --> 24:24.680]  Don't just drop off that nitrogen completely.
[24:24.680 --> 24:27.640]  That's when you will see problems.
[24:27.640 --> 24:31.920]  The moon tower does enjoy moderate defoliation, but don't overdo it.
[24:31.920 --> 24:33.520]  I like to defoliate plants.
[24:33.520 --> 24:37.360]  I've learned that if you over defoliate the moon tower, she will get a little bit pissy
[24:37.360 --> 24:39.660]  with you, so don't overdo it.
[24:39.660 --> 24:40.660]  Go lightly.
[24:40.660 --> 24:46.140]  Instead of doing one fat defoliation, over a couple of weeks, do a couple of light defoliates.
[24:46.140 --> 24:47.940]  It will work better for you.
[24:47.940 --> 24:52.980]  I usually suggest popping and twisting these plants to build structure and mitigate stretch.
[24:52.980 --> 24:55.100]  That is something I recommend on most of my plants.
[24:55.100 --> 25:00.020]  I've got a few cultivars that don't react well to it, but the moon tower responds well.
[25:00.020 --> 25:03.380]  If you don't know what I'm talking about, I've done a full episode on popping and twisting.
[25:03.380 --> 25:06.820]  I basically grab the plant with two hands and give it a twist in different directions
[25:06.820 --> 25:09.380]  and it goes like popping a knuckle.
[25:09.380 --> 25:13.900]  It makes the plant break the cellulose fiber right there and it will rebuild a little knuckle.
[25:13.900 --> 25:15.980]  It looks a little bit knurled might be the word.
[25:15.980 --> 25:16.980]  It makes it stronger.
[25:16.980 --> 25:18.500]  It also slows down.
[25:18.500 --> 25:19.660]  It's going to make it stronger right there.
[25:19.660 --> 25:21.780]  It can support itself a little bit better.
[25:21.780 --> 25:24.060]  More nutrients can flow through a thicker stem.
[25:24.060 --> 25:28.420]  Also that will slow down the vertical stretch so they're not growing as quickly through
[25:28.420 --> 25:29.420]  that phase.
[25:29.420 --> 25:31.620]  It'll slow that down and make them stronger.
[25:31.620 --> 25:34.860]  One thing I think really helps with these plants is keep the pH consistent.
[25:34.860 --> 25:36.780]  They seem to like that consistent pH.
[25:36.780 --> 25:39.940]  pH swings, pH jumps, they get a little bit out of control.
[25:39.940 --> 25:42.140]  Of course, medium does matter.
[25:42.140 --> 25:44.700]  They really will like consistent pH.
[25:44.700 --> 25:46.900]  I mentioned before they like cow mag.
[25:46.900 --> 25:50.140]  They really enjoy kelp and these plants responded.
[25:50.140 --> 25:51.980]  Week six we hit them with bud swell.
[25:51.980 --> 25:52.980]  They went fucking kaboom.
[25:52.980 --> 25:54.340]  So hit them with that bud swell.
[25:54.340 --> 25:55.620]  They should be happy.
[25:55.620 --> 25:59.260]  I'd want to remind you don't panic if they turn yellow close to the end.
[25:59.260 --> 26:00.380]  That is called senescence.
[26:00.380 --> 26:03.260]  They're starting to, they're just dying, but they're still living.
[26:03.260 --> 26:04.380]  Keep the buds going.
[26:04.380 --> 26:05.380]  The leaves are going to die.
[26:05.380 --> 26:07.420]  We're going to cut off the leaves anyway.
[26:07.420 --> 26:08.940]  That is okay.
[26:08.940 --> 26:13.620]  Harvest of these plants will generally be ready around day 63 to day 67.
[26:13.620 --> 26:17.180]  I always recommend going long for your first couple of runs.
[26:17.180 --> 26:18.180]  See what they do.
[26:18.180 --> 26:21.260]  I told you when I hit them with bud swell, they really swelled up.
[26:21.260 --> 26:26.140]  Maybe if you let them go 74, 75 days, they really might beef up at the end there.
[26:26.140 --> 26:27.420]  Pay attention to the trichomes.
[26:27.420 --> 26:28.780]  That's really what matters.
[26:28.780 --> 26:30.460]  Let the plants finish.
[26:30.460 --> 26:31.460]  Let the plants finish.
[26:31.540 --> 26:36.020]  I do recommend though at least 70 days, 63, 70 days is ideal.
[26:36.020 --> 26:37.020]  You will get outliers.
[26:37.020 --> 26:39.220]  Of course there will be 60 day finishers.
[26:39.220 --> 26:42.780]  I believe that if you've got the right setup for the moon tower, you can get pretty fat
[26:42.780 --> 26:43.980]  harvest from her.
[26:43.980 --> 26:46.940]  If you clean up the bottom of her, give her that attention she deserves.
[26:46.940 --> 26:50.020]  Make sure there's no junk on the bottom, no larv, none of that fluffy stuff, none of that
[26:50.020 --> 26:52.420]  wasted buds, none of those mini shoots.
[26:52.420 --> 26:56.460]  Clean all that shit up, send all that energy up to the top, spread it out, get plenty of
[26:56.460 --> 27:00.660]  light down into the canopy with a good light, with the proper care, with the right airflow.
[27:00.860 --> 27:05.060]  I predict that you could get pretty fat harvest from the moon tower.
[27:05.060 --> 27:06.060]  I don't want to give you numbers.
[27:06.060 --> 27:07.060]  I don't want to set expectations.
[27:07.060 --> 27:11.660]  I'm going to say if you do it right and you put in the work, a new grower can get fatty
[27:11.660 --> 27:14.660]  harvest from these plants.
[27:14.660 --> 27:17.620]  I do want to take a moment to give a shout out to my friend Lefty.
[27:17.620 --> 27:20.780]  I was throwing around a strain name ideas.
[27:20.780 --> 27:21.900]  It's really hard to name strains.
[27:21.900 --> 27:24.020]  All the cool shit is taken, all the things in my head.
[27:24.020 --> 27:28.420]  As soon as I come up with it, I feel like I telegraph it out to other people and they
[27:28.420 --> 27:29.700]  take the strain name.
[27:29.740 --> 27:31.940]  I've had a bunch of cool names in my head.
[27:31.940 --> 27:32.940]  I'm a big fan.
[27:32.940 --> 27:35.980]  If you've been listening this far, now is the time that I'm going to reveal how the
[27:35.980 --> 27:37.260]  strain got named.
[27:37.260 --> 27:40.340]  I'm a big fan of the movie Dazed and Confused.
[27:40.340 --> 27:42.940]  I try to name stuff after Dazed and Confused.
[27:42.940 --> 27:46.380]  My buddy Lefty's got a strain known as Wooderson.
[27:46.380 --> 27:48.260]  That is banana cush to a rise.
[27:48.260 --> 27:52.500]  I've had moon tower written on a strain name list for a long time.
[27:52.500 --> 27:53.900]  I got a document in my phone.
[27:53.900 --> 27:55.300]  It is just strain names.
[27:55.300 --> 27:56.300]  That's all it is.
[27:56.300 --> 27:57.300]  I watch a movie or whatever.
[27:57.300 --> 28:00.380]  I get a strain name idea, type it down in the list.
[28:00.380 --> 28:03.540]  When new strains come up, we scroll through and see if anything matches and if it works
[28:03.540 --> 28:04.540]  out in my head.
[28:04.540 --> 28:06.460]  Moon tower was on the list for a long time.
[28:06.460 --> 28:07.460]  I was in a chat.
[28:07.460 --> 28:09.620]  I said, what do we name the bubba cush to a rise?
[28:09.620 --> 28:11.700]  My buddy Lefty said the moon tower.
[28:11.700 --> 28:12.700]  I just saw that movie.
[28:12.700 --> 28:14.460]  I just watched it with my girlfriend.
[28:14.460 --> 28:15.460]  She'd never seen it before.
[28:15.460 --> 28:16.460]  She's from Sweden.
[28:16.460 --> 28:17.740]  I introduced her to that movie.
[28:17.740 --> 28:18.740]  She laughed.
[28:18.740 --> 28:19.740]  She liked it.
[28:19.740 --> 28:21.380]  Lefty said moon tower.
[28:21.380 --> 28:23.900]  I just talked about banana cush to a rise a moment ago.
[28:23.900 --> 28:24.900]  I was like, that's going to work.
[28:24.900 --> 28:26.260]  It became the moon tower.
[28:26.260 --> 28:29.940]  It came from the movie dazed and confused, the party at the moon tower.
[28:29.940 --> 28:33.620]  That was a good movie that came out right around the time that I was partying at the
[28:33.620 --> 28:34.620]  moon tower, bro.
[28:34.620 --> 28:36.340]  Not really at the moon tower, but you get it.
[28:36.340 --> 28:37.540]  We were at different places.
[28:37.540 --> 28:38.700]  Anyway, that doesn't matter.
[28:38.700 --> 28:39.700]  That's where the name came from.
[28:39.700 --> 28:40.700]  Shout out to my buddy Lefty.
[28:40.700 --> 28:43.060]  Lefty, bro, I hope you and the wife are well.
[28:43.060 --> 28:44.260]  Hope you're killing it down there.
[28:44.260 --> 28:48.020]  Thanks for all the good work that you do for me and great job with those testers, dude.
[28:48.020 --> 28:49.020]  You did so good.
[28:49.020 --> 28:53.540]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[28:53.540 --> 28:58.300]  lawn cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you wonderful, amazing cannabis enthusiasts and
[28:58.300 --> 28:59.300]  growers out there.
[28:59.300 --> 29:02.820]  Thank you once again for listening to my report on the moon tower.
[29:02.820 --> 29:07.060]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, concerns, positive feedback, constructive
[29:07.060 --> 29:09.580]  criticism, maybe I left some shit out.
[29:09.580 --> 29:10.580]  Maybe you got more questions.
[29:10.580 --> 29:11.580]  I would love to hear from you.
[29:11.580 --> 29:14.780]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:14.780 --> 29:15.780]  Don't be shy.
[29:15.780 --> 29:16.780]  Send me those messages.
[29:16.780 --> 29:21.220]  I do check that email quite often looking for your constructive criticism.
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.740]  Anything else may be on the website.
[29:22.940 --> 29:25.620]  Check out my website, ieregenetics.com.
[29:25.620 --> 29:26.620]  That's real easy to find.
[29:26.620 --> 29:32.940]  I-R-I-E-G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S, ieregenetics.com.
[29:32.940 --> 29:34.700]  Check that out on the interwebs there.
[29:34.700 --> 29:37.300]  All the information you need will be right there on the website.
[29:37.300 --> 29:40.620]  If you're looking for the Discord link, if you're looking for seed vendors, if you're
[29:40.620 --> 29:44.340]  looking for merchandise, I recommend while you're there you sign up for the newsletter.
[29:44.340 --> 29:47.780]  There's a little spot about halfway down that you can join the newsletter.
[29:47.780 --> 29:49.060]  Sign up right there.
[29:49.060 --> 29:52.100]  Very shortly I will be sending out a great newsletter.
[29:52.100 --> 29:54.980]  Those of you who have signed up for the MailChimp, I haven't been sending out a bunch of stuff
[29:54.980 --> 29:56.340]  because I haven't had a lot to report.
[29:56.340 --> 29:58.540]  I say most of it here on the show.
[29:58.540 --> 30:02.420]  I don't want to spam you and bombard you, but I do have something coming up very soon.
[30:02.420 --> 30:06.780]  If you're not already signed up to the newsletter, I do recommend you sign up to that because
[30:06.780 --> 30:09.060]  there's a cool announcement coming very soon.
[30:09.060 --> 30:13.860]  The newsletter, the Discord, and the Patreon will be the first places to hear about that
[30:13.860 --> 30:16.500]  cool new thing that is being built.
[30:16.500 --> 30:18.940]  Big shout out to my buddy Ben for the help.
[30:18.940 --> 30:21.900]  The newsletter, the website, I think that's all I've got for you guys.
[30:21.900 --> 30:23.620]  Thanks again for watching and listening.
[30:23.620 --> 30:29.260]  If you are only watching the show on Spotify or Apple Podcasts or Stitcher Radio, I do
[30:29.260 --> 30:31.580]  invite you to come join us on the YouTube channel.
[30:31.580 --> 30:33.940]  There's a 4K YouTube video going on.
[30:33.940 --> 30:37.980]  I'm pointing at you right now, inviting you, you, come hang out with us.
[30:37.980 --> 30:39.740]  At least subscribe to the show on YouTube.
[30:39.740 --> 30:40.740]  I would appreciate that.
[30:40.740 --> 30:42.980]  I'm trying to get up to 10,000 subscribers.
[30:42.980 --> 30:44.900]  Please subscribe on the YouTube server.
[30:44.900 --> 30:45.900]  That's enough begging.
[30:45.900 --> 30:48.180]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for this episode.
[30:48.180 --> 30:50.740]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[30:50.780 --> 30:53.820]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy Pedro's Grow Room.
[30:53.820 --> 30:57.300]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
