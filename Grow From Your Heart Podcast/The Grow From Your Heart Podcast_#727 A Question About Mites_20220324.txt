[00:05.950 --> 00:27.050]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:27.050 --> 00:28.050]  I'm your host.
[00:28.050 --> 00:29.810]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.810 --> 00:35.330]  This is episode 727 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.330 --> 00:40.090]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a listener email before I get to that part of the show.
[00:40.090 --> 00:44.690]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[00:44.690 --> 00:46.430]  on Patreon.
[00:46.430 --> 00:49.070]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:09.670 --> 01:11.870]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Kip.
[01:11.870 --> 01:14.950]  Then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:14.950 --> 01:15.950]  Thank you.
[01:15.950 --> 01:18.630]  Shout out to Operation High Vibes.
[01:18.630 --> 01:23.550]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:23.550 --> 01:27.190]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:27.190 --> 01:33.550]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:33.550 --> 01:35.990]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:35.990 --> 01:40.350]  And you know, I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:40.350 --> 01:44.510]  it nice and easy for all of my friends to support the show.
[01:44.510 --> 01:48.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am recording on what I think may be the windiest day of the year.
[01:48.990 --> 01:50.630]  I can hear all kinds of chaos outside.
[01:50.630 --> 01:52.270]  I'm not sure if it's coming through the microphone.
[01:52.270 --> 01:55.710]  I do have a lot of software and toys and gadgetry working here.
[01:55.710 --> 01:58.150]  There will be some post production fixing.
[01:58.150 --> 02:02.070]  I do apologize if you hear the chaos that is ensuing in my neighborhood.
[02:02.070 --> 02:06.230]  I did the thing where I just say that occasionally here, we just trade trash cans.
[02:06.230 --> 02:10.350]  Usually it's that neighbor gets my trash cans and I get that neighbor's trash can.
[02:10.350 --> 02:11.350]  We just do the trash cans.
[02:11.350 --> 02:13.230]  We all shift trash cans to the left.
[02:13.230 --> 02:17.070]  It feels like this week we're shifting two or three trash cans to the left.
[02:17.070 --> 02:18.590]  Just exchanging of the cans is happening.
[02:18.590 --> 02:20.190]  I apologize if you hear it.
[02:20.190 --> 02:21.390]  That's enough rambling about that.
[02:21.390 --> 02:27.990]  However, if you do hear thuds, pops, bumps, bangs, there, well, probably there's nobody
[02:27.990 --> 02:28.990]  tied up.
[02:28.990 --> 02:30.870]  Nobody detained here against their will.
[02:30.870 --> 02:34.550]  Maybe, but most likely what you're hearing is the wind and debris pounding against the
[02:34.550 --> 02:35.550]  house.
[02:35.550 --> 02:36.750]  The trash cans are going crazy.
[02:36.750 --> 02:37.750]  Lots of shit going on.
[02:37.750 --> 02:38.750]  The trees are hitting the roof.
[02:38.750 --> 02:40.110]  Anyway, that's enough of that.
[02:40.110 --> 02:41.350]  Let's talk about some fun shit, dude.
[02:41.350 --> 02:42.710]  I got a new rig.
[02:42.710 --> 02:44.470]  I got a new rig and I like it.
[02:44.470 --> 02:45.510]  My birthday was recently.
[02:45.510 --> 02:48.830]  I did allow myself a little budget for a brand new birthday rig.
[02:48.830 --> 02:50.310]  I guess I should have it right here.
[02:50.310 --> 02:51.310]  Hang on, watch.
[02:51.310 --> 02:52.310]  We'll do some magical editing.
[02:52.310 --> 02:54.030]  Uh, you may have been paying attention recently.
[02:54.030 --> 02:56.430]  You may have heard me talk about it being my birthday.
[02:56.430 --> 02:57.830]  That's right for my birthday.
[02:57.830 --> 02:59.950]  I did buy myself a brand new rig.
[02:59.950 --> 03:01.630]  I left myself a nice budget.
[03:01.630 --> 03:03.470]  I went to a, one of my favorite glass shops.
[03:03.470 --> 03:04.630]  I went to a few glass shops.
[03:04.630 --> 03:08.910]  I looked around for a little bit and I saw a rig that was not super expensive, but it's
[03:08.910 --> 03:10.430]  super caught my eye.
[03:10.430 --> 03:12.270]  I do like a rig that is super functional.
[03:12.830 --> 03:15.950]  I like a rig that hits more than a lots of water flow and lots of movement.
[03:15.950 --> 03:20.710]  I want the smoke to hit the banger and then go through some water to cool down.
[03:20.710 --> 03:23.150]  Then I want it to go to my lungs, to my brain.
[03:23.150 --> 03:25.710]  I don't need a lot of movement, not a lot of fanciness.
[03:25.710 --> 03:27.630]  I prefer a rig that functions super well.
[03:27.630 --> 03:31.430]  So I will show you now I will debut for the show, the rig that I have chosen.
[03:31.430 --> 03:32.550]  This is the color here.
[03:32.550 --> 03:33.750]  It doesn't show up super great.
[03:33.750 --> 03:36.710]  I can't tell if the color is coming up on the camera with the weird lighting in the
[03:36.710 --> 03:37.710]  room.
[03:37.710 --> 03:38.710]  I'll try to correct it.
[03:39.270 --> 03:44.390]  In the post production here, also may post a photograph of this in the video feed.
[03:44.390 --> 03:46.870]  But if you're watching the video, this color is called ghost.
[03:46.870 --> 03:50.750]  It's kind of a light baby blue, kind of close to the UNC blue.
[03:50.750 --> 03:53.430]  If you're a sneaker head, I really love it.
[03:53.430 --> 03:57.750]  It is a, it's a bottle shape with a, it's got kind of a donut in the middle here.
[03:57.750 --> 04:01.590]  This donut, the piece where it separates here actually works as a splash guard.
[04:01.590 --> 04:03.430]  So if I pull real hard, I'll give you an example here.
[04:03.430 --> 04:08.190]  If I dab real hard, that water will not splash up into my face.
[04:08.190 --> 04:10.030]  I do like that.
[04:10.030 --> 04:11.870]  So we've got a glass rig here.
[04:11.870 --> 04:14.550]  It is a 10 millimeter joint on this rig.
[04:14.550 --> 04:17.450]  The rig itself is by Brody glass.
[04:17.450 --> 04:22.150]  The banger here is from DCS courts.
[04:22.150 --> 04:23.350]  It's really super deep.
[04:23.350 --> 04:24.350]  It holds heat real well.
[04:24.350 --> 04:25.350]  I like this.
[04:25.350 --> 04:29.630]  I'm going to do my best to keep this cleaner than I have most of my glass from the past.
[04:29.630 --> 04:31.910]  And also we've got a beautiful carb cap here.
[04:31.910 --> 04:33.270]  This one came from Bowman glass.
[04:33.270 --> 04:35.030]  I really like this carb cap.
[04:35.030 --> 04:36.990]  Funny as I pick it up, I noticed there's a hair stuck to it.
[04:36.990 --> 04:39.270]  I just said I was going to keep things cleaner.
[04:39.270 --> 04:41.190]  That happened when I set it in here.
[04:41.190 --> 04:42.470]  This carb cap, I really like this.
[04:42.470 --> 04:43.470]  It's a bubble cap.
[04:43.470 --> 04:44.470]  It's got a hole here.
[04:44.470 --> 04:45.670]  The air would travel through here.
[04:45.670 --> 04:46.670]  You'd cap the banger.
[04:46.670 --> 04:47.830]  Let me just show you where it goes.
[04:47.830 --> 04:51.630]  It goes here so that the air can travel through here, restrict the movement of the air through
[04:51.630 --> 04:53.030]  here, give you a better rip.
[04:53.030 --> 04:54.230]  It's got this nice handle on it.
[04:54.230 --> 04:58.070]  I tend to hold it with these fingers, put my middle finger over the hole to kind of
[04:58.070 --> 05:00.950]  restrict the air a little bit better, spin it around a little bit.
[05:00.950 --> 05:01.950]  These are both just a touchstick.
[05:01.950 --> 05:02.990]  You need to be cleaned up.
[05:02.990 --> 05:04.910]  I'm a bad wook, a bad dabber.
[05:04.910 --> 05:06.830]  I should be cleaning this much better.
[05:06.830 --> 05:12.190]  Speaking of cleaning things better, I did invite our friend Pedro, Mr. Rosen's Neighborhood,
[05:12.190 --> 05:15.630]  Pedro's Grow Room, Rosen is Legal Fuckers, whatever you want to call him.
[05:15.630 --> 05:16.630]  I call him my friend Pedro.
[05:16.630 --> 05:17.630]  What up, bro?
[05:17.630 --> 05:18.630]  Hope you're watching this.
[05:18.630 --> 05:23.990]  I did ask Pedro to make us a quick video on how to keep our banger clean because I did
[05:23.990 --> 05:29.190]  see Pedro complain on social media, rightly so, that somebody hit his expensive banger,
[05:29.190 --> 05:30.710]  stained it, left it dirty.
[05:30.710 --> 05:34.070]  So I politely said, hey, Pedro, would you like to do a quick video that I can play on
[05:34.070 --> 05:37.390]  the podcast to show people how to care for our expensive bangers?
[05:37.390 --> 05:40.310]  Because those bangers are not cheap if you get the good quality stuff.
[05:40.310 --> 05:41.310]  Pedro will do us a video.
[05:41.310 --> 05:43.910]  Anyway, my point was I wanted to show off this sweet new rig.
[05:43.910 --> 05:44.910]  I got a new rig.
[05:44.910 --> 05:47.070]  I wanted to shout out the glass makers that make all this great stuff.
[05:47.070 --> 05:48.930]  They don't get enough love, enough credit.
[05:48.930 --> 05:53.190]  So once again, big shout out to Brody Glass, big shout out to Bowman Glass, and of course,
[05:53.190 --> 05:56.790]  big shout out to DCS Quartz for the awesome banger setup there.
[05:56.790 --> 06:00.830]  Then most of all, big shout out to our friends at Positively Vibes for the great love and
[06:00.830 --> 06:02.590]  respect and the good deals on the glass.
[06:02.590 --> 06:03.950]  I got a nice case.
[06:04.030 --> 06:05.030]  I got a bunch of glob mops.
[06:05.030 --> 06:06.990]  I got some other accessories.
[06:06.990 --> 06:08.590]  Also had a great time in the shop.
[06:08.590 --> 06:09.910]  They treat myself like royalty.
[06:09.910 --> 06:12.790]  They treat my queen like royalty in there as well.
[06:12.790 --> 06:15.430]  Sometimes when you take your girlfriend to places, they don't talk to her.
[06:15.430 --> 06:17.590]  They only talk to me and they kind of ignore her.
[06:17.590 --> 06:18.590]  They're really cool.
[06:18.590 --> 06:23.150]  They make sure to include her and make her feel included, which is important to me.
[06:23.150 --> 06:25.510]  So speaking of the new rig, I bought a couple of new bangers.
[06:25.510 --> 06:26.910]  I got a Terp Slurper.
[06:26.910 --> 06:28.310]  I got a different style banger.
[06:28.310 --> 06:30.110]  I got a taller banger, a shorter banger.
[06:30.110 --> 06:31.390]  I got a banger with some...
[06:31.390 --> 06:32.650]  I got some Terp Pearls.
[06:32.650 --> 06:34.170]  I got a different carb cap.
[06:34.170 --> 06:37.610]  I am still experimenting to see what kind of banger I like best on here.
[06:37.610 --> 06:38.690]  I like this banger a lot.
[06:38.690 --> 06:40.530]  However, it's a little bit deep.
[06:40.530 --> 06:42.730]  So I do have to get a different carb cap.
[06:42.730 --> 06:43.730]  I ordered it.
[06:43.730 --> 06:44.730]  It's on the way.
[06:44.730 --> 06:45.730]  It should show up.
[06:45.730 --> 06:46.730]  You may hear the doorbell ringing while we're recording.
[06:46.730 --> 06:48.370]  Apparently, it's out for delivery today.
[06:48.370 --> 06:49.370]  I should get that.
[06:49.370 --> 06:50.370]  But I'm learning.
[06:50.370 --> 06:51.530]  I'm adjusting.
[06:51.530 --> 06:56.010]  What I've noticed is with the new banger and the new Terp Slurper and everything, my heating
[06:56.010 --> 06:57.410]  and timing is a little bit off.
[06:57.410 --> 07:02.410]  I'm relearning how long to heat, how long to cool, how long I need each banger before
[07:03.170 --> 07:04.170]  I hit it.
[07:04.170 --> 07:05.170]  That's a new...
[07:05.170 --> 07:06.170]  What is it?
[07:06.170 --> 07:07.170]  A learning curve that I'm going through there.
[07:07.170 --> 07:10.610]  Also, I don't know that I like the Terp Slurper.
[07:10.610 --> 07:12.250]  I feel like the Terp Slurper...
[07:12.250 --> 07:15.370]  I'll put a picture of a Terp Slurper and a normal banger up on the screen so you can
[07:15.370 --> 07:16.730]  tell the difference.
[07:16.730 --> 07:18.250]  I'm not sure I'm enjoying the Terp Slurper.
[07:18.250 --> 07:22.370]  I like the restriction of the carb cap on top of the bucket or banger.
[07:22.370 --> 07:24.370]  The Terp Slurper seems to...
[07:24.370 --> 07:27.130]  Since the holes are down there at the bottom, there's no way to restrict them.
[07:27.130 --> 07:30.490]  I don't feel like I can restrict it and get the dab flow that I want.
[07:30.570 --> 07:33.770]  That is just my personal experience, personal preference.
[07:33.770 --> 07:38.370]  I think I'm going to be sticking with the bucket banger type style.
[07:38.370 --> 07:42.050]  I'm not sure if I like the Terp Pearls inside the banger or not.
[07:42.050 --> 07:46.730]  My new banger is a little deeper, so it will require a spinner cap and Terp Pearls for
[07:46.730 --> 07:48.170]  this to work properly.
[07:48.170 --> 07:50.410]  I've been putting the pearls in there and using a normal cap.
[07:50.410 --> 07:51.770]  It works pretty good.
[07:51.770 --> 07:53.610]  When this new cap gets here, I will give you an update.
[07:53.610 --> 07:55.170]  I bet you it's going to freaking rock.
[07:55.170 --> 07:56.170]  It's going to rip.
[07:56.170 --> 07:57.170]  It's going to shred.
[07:57.170 --> 08:00.330]  I'm still learning how to heat it, how long to heat it, how long to let it cool.
[08:01.170 --> 08:02.170]  It's a learning process.
[08:02.170 --> 08:05.770]  I've been talking for a long time about just heat it and hit it, and you'll figure it out.
[08:05.770 --> 08:07.850]  What I'm learning is you're going to have to waste a couple of dabs.
[08:07.850 --> 08:09.930]  You're going to let a couple not get hot enough.
[08:09.930 --> 08:11.410]  You're going to make a couple of too hot dabs.
[08:11.410 --> 08:12.410]  You're going to burn your lungs.
[08:12.410 --> 08:13.850]  You're going to roast your throat.
[08:13.850 --> 08:14.850]  Have fun.
[08:14.850 --> 08:16.290]  Figure it out, and then take a lot of notes.
[08:16.290 --> 08:20.530]  Also, if you really want to get critical, they do sell some devices that you can measure
[08:20.530 --> 08:22.310]  the temperature of your banger.
[08:22.310 --> 08:24.050]  You can get it to the right temp.
[08:24.050 --> 08:25.570]  People will make recommendations for you.
[08:25.570 --> 08:27.650]  You can get your banger to the perfect temp every time.
[08:27.650 --> 08:29.050]  Make a note of what that is.
[08:29.050 --> 08:30.050]  Repeat that.
[08:30.050 --> 08:31.050]  I'm going to do a SOP for taking dabs.
[08:31.050 --> 08:32.050]  That'll be beautiful.
[08:32.050 --> 08:34.930]  Where am I in my notes?
[08:34.930 --> 08:37.530]  I'm not sure I'm convinced over the Terp Slurper.
[08:37.530 --> 08:38.730]  That's one of the things I wanted to mention.
[08:38.730 --> 08:39.730]  I'm not sure.
[08:39.730 --> 08:41.890]  I don't like that airflow.
[08:41.890 --> 08:43.970]  Things are really expensive to do a lot of testing.
[08:43.970 --> 08:48.130]  Buying a couple of bangers, a Terp Slurper, some pearls, a couple of different carb caps,
[08:48.130 --> 08:51.890]  that really did add up quickly, but it was worth it for the show, worth it for the experiment,
[08:51.890 --> 08:53.170]  for the experience.
[08:53.170 --> 08:57.570]  I will let you know what I learn, and once I get more things figured out, I will do sort
[08:57.570 --> 08:58.730]  of an updated video.
[08:58.730 --> 09:00.930]  I know I've done a dabbing video.
[09:00.930 --> 09:03.570]  We've talked about taking dabs, but we did miss a few things.
[09:03.570 --> 09:06.690]  I'm going to continue because that will bring me back to what I'm going to talk about here.
[09:06.690 --> 09:08.330]  This is going to loop around.
[09:08.330 --> 09:10.490]  Also, why am I so rambly?
[09:10.490 --> 09:11.770]  Why am I so stoned?
[09:11.770 --> 09:16.650]  Because one of my friends met me somewhere recently, and he passed me a three gram jar
[09:16.650 --> 09:20.010]  of Lemon Jeffrey Live Rosin.
[09:20.010 --> 09:24.410]  And my day, my life has not been the same since I got that concentrate.
[09:24.410 --> 09:30.490]  I got the new rig, I got the new rosin, and I have just been slightly silly since that
[09:30.490 --> 09:31.490]  happened.
[09:31.490 --> 09:35.130]  So big shout out to my friend for hooking me up with the Lemon Jeffrey Live Rosin.
[09:35.130 --> 09:37.210]  That shit is delicious.
[09:37.210 --> 09:41.330]  The amazing aromas and flavors that I love in the Lemon Jeffrey were right there.
[09:41.330 --> 09:42.570]  The potency is perfect.
[09:42.570 --> 09:43.570]  It's beautiful.
[09:43.570 --> 09:45.210]  The color, the texture, the consistency.
[09:45.210 --> 09:46.210]  I was amazed.
[09:46.210 --> 09:47.210]  I love this rosin.
[09:47.210 --> 09:48.530]  It is delicious.
[09:48.530 --> 09:51.170]  It was so deliciously smelling.
[09:51.170 --> 09:54.850]  It smelled so good that my girlfriend doesn't take dabs.
[09:54.850 --> 09:56.770]  She rarely smokes ganja.
[09:56.770 --> 09:58.290]  That's just not her thing.
[09:58.290 --> 10:00.950]  She'll hit a vape pen occasionally.
[10:00.950 --> 10:05.970]  She decided that it smelled so good that she had to take a little dab of the Lemon Jeffrey,
[10:05.970 --> 10:08.070]  and she really enjoyed her buzz.
[10:08.070 --> 10:11.090]  She giggled, she smiled, she laughed for a couple hours.
[10:11.090 --> 10:12.090]  That was a good time.
[10:12.090 --> 10:14.090]  So that's how good that shit smelled.
[10:14.090 --> 10:15.490]  She had to take a dab.
[10:15.490 --> 10:18.530]  Anyway, let me loop back to where I was.
[10:18.530 --> 10:20.890]  I was at a store yesterday.
[10:21.610 --> 10:24.970]  I went to go pick up some other smoking accessories at a local shop.
[10:24.970 --> 10:29.770]  There was a couple in there that was asking the person in the shop, the clerk, I guess,
[10:29.770 --> 10:34.490]  the person working, asking a lot of questions about dabbing, about how long to heat things,
[10:34.490 --> 10:38.650]  how to let it cool, how much to dab, how to get the dab into the banger.
[10:38.650 --> 10:43.010]  They were asking a lot of questions, and it made me realize how much more I could be teaching.
[10:43.010 --> 10:46.290]  I need to just pop in randomly to these head shops and dispensaries and just listen to
[10:46.290 --> 10:48.290]  the questions that people are asking.
[10:48.290 --> 10:52.850]  It gave me some ideas of things that I could teach you guys.
[10:52.850 --> 10:56.010]  One thing that I want to recommend, I am going to do another dabbing video.
[10:56.010 --> 10:57.290]  I've said this just a moment ago.
[10:57.290 --> 11:00.330]  I'm going to do another video where I teach you about different bangers.
[11:00.330 --> 11:04.250]  I'm going to put a Terp Slurper in there because I didn't have a Slurper in the last video.
[11:04.250 --> 11:06.370]  We'll put some Terp Pearls in the banger.
[11:06.370 --> 11:07.410]  We'll use a spinner cap.
[11:07.410 --> 11:08.450]  We'll do different things like that.
[11:08.450 --> 11:09.610]  We'll talk about heat.
[11:09.610 --> 11:11.290]  We may even buy a dab right.
[11:11.290 --> 11:14.450]  Maybe we could use that as a, if I buy it for the podcast, maybe it's a tax write-off.
[11:14.450 --> 11:16.130]  We could get a dab right.
[11:16.130 --> 11:20.650]  Or maybe somebody from Dab Right or Positively Vibe wants to sponsor the show and send us
[11:20.650 --> 11:24.810]  a dab right or some sort of a Terp thermometer so we could take dabs with that.
[11:24.810 --> 11:28.410]  We'll teach you guys how to use that also so you can get that perfect dab every time.
[11:28.410 --> 11:33.010]  Then also we're going to talk about things like nectar collectors and puff cos and dab
[11:33.010 --> 11:35.410]  straws and new things that are coming out.
[11:35.410 --> 11:39.650]  Also, there's other tech and other things, other toys and other tools that I've seen
[11:39.650 --> 11:43.890]  now at the shops that I've never talked about, some things I've never even experienced.
[11:43.890 --> 11:47.930]  Being there yesterday and having to wait on the clerk to help that couple before me
[11:47.930 --> 11:50.770]  really showed me there's some things that I'm slacking on teaching you on.
[11:50.770 --> 11:54.410]  So that will inspire a new dab episode to come out in the future.
[11:54.410 --> 11:55.410]  I'll learn a lot more.
[11:55.410 --> 11:56.410]  We'll do a lot more stuff.
[11:56.410 --> 12:00.450]  I'll try not to make you wait until 7-10 for that, but that could be what happens.
[12:00.450 --> 12:04.410]  Honestly, the episodes go by so quickly and time travels really quickly right now.
[12:04.410 --> 12:07.530]  Anyway, what I'm saying is I owe you another episode about dabbing.
[12:07.530 --> 12:12.690]  The one thing I want to make sure to say right now is if you're buying a device, if it's
[12:12.690 --> 12:19.450]  a dab rig, if it's a nectar collector, whatever you intend on smoking your concentrates through,
[12:19.450 --> 12:23.210]  I highly recommend that it's got water in it to make some bubbles.
[12:23.210 --> 12:26.490]  Water and bubbles are your friend when you are smoking concentrates.
[12:26.490 --> 12:30.570]  We're going to heat these concentrates up, whether it's your nectar collector or your
[12:30.570 --> 12:33.530]  dab rig, if you're hitting a nail, a banger, a nectar collector.
[12:33.530 --> 12:34.530]  I said that one already.
[12:34.530 --> 12:37.530]  A Terpslurper is what I'm trying to say, the word that won't come to my brain.
[12:37.530 --> 12:40.010]  Whatever you're hitting, you got to heat it up quite hot.
[12:40.010 --> 12:43.690]  If it doesn't go through some water and some filtration, it's going to kind of roast your
[12:43.690 --> 12:45.370]  lungs, your throat, your esophagus.
[12:45.370 --> 12:46.890]  It's not going to feel super pleasant.
[12:46.890 --> 12:49.090]  You're not going to enjoy it as much as you could.
[12:49.090 --> 12:53.850]  My first recommendation, my number one advice is when you're buying any sort of smoking
[12:53.850 --> 12:58.610]  apparatus for concentrates is that it does pass through water.
[12:58.610 --> 13:01.410]  This rig right here, it doesn't have a lot of water and it's got this little tiny down
[13:01.410 --> 13:07.890]  stem, but this little bit of water that really saves your throat, saves your lungs, your
[13:07.890 --> 13:09.770]  esophagus, everything in between there.
[13:09.810 --> 13:12.170]  I think it makes a much more enjoyable experience.
[13:13.370 --> 13:16.650]  Also, when it comes to smoking devices, I don't want a big bong.
[13:16.650 --> 13:19.370]  I don't want a giant smoking device for concentrates.
[13:19.370 --> 13:20.210]  I want a little piece.
[13:20.210 --> 13:20.770]  I don't need.
[13:20.970 --> 13:24.370]  So the idea with the bong, you'd fill the whole bong with all that smoke and you pull
[13:24.370 --> 13:27.570]  the carb and then the fucking smoke all goes to your head and you get a big rip.
[13:27.570 --> 13:27.730]  Right.
[13:27.730 --> 13:30.690]  With the dab, you don't have to carve it that way necessarily.
[13:30.690 --> 13:31.650]  You don't fill it as much.
[13:31.850 --> 13:35.250]  I do a little carb work with the carb cap, but I'm not trying to get fill it, fill it,
[13:35.250 --> 13:36.490]  clear it, fill it, fill it, clear it.
[13:36.490 --> 13:37.810]  I'm just going straight to the dome.
[13:37.810 --> 13:39.570]  We got the carb cap work in that action.
[13:39.770 --> 13:41.010]  I don't need such a big device.
[13:41.010 --> 13:45.650]  A smaller device is better for dabs in my humble opinion.
[13:45.650 --> 13:48.690]  All right, let me check my notes and see where we are talking about the dab rig.
[13:48.690 --> 13:52.210]  And then we're going to jump into a couple of these emails that I've got here in front
[13:52.210 --> 13:52.370]  of me.
[13:52.370 --> 13:53.850]  Let me make sure I covered everything.
[13:54.250 --> 13:56.530]  Uh, had to get new stuff.
[13:56.690 --> 13:59.130]  Uh, had to get some turt pearls cause the banger was too deep.
[13:59.130 --> 14:00.210]  Had to get a spinner cap.
[14:00.210 --> 14:02.810]  We're going to talk about spinner caps and slurpers in the future.
[14:03.210 --> 14:06.930]  Uh, I do understand how quickly things can add up, how quickly it gets expensive.
[14:07.130 --> 14:09.970]  So let me go spend some money, do some experiments and then I'll teach you about
[14:09.970 --> 14:12.290]  it so you guys don't have to waste all the money is what I'm trying to do.
[14:12.770 --> 14:17.050]  Um, always use water for filtration and in the future we'll do an episode talking
[14:17.050 --> 14:21.050]  about nectar collectors, dab straws, puff co's, all that cool shit.
[14:21.090 --> 14:22.690]  I'll write that episode and get it out soon.
[14:22.730 --> 14:25.170]  Also, here's the last part that I almost forgot to tell you.
[14:25.890 --> 14:31.410]  Um, solvent list episode part two, big shout out to, uh, Pedro.
[14:31.410 --> 14:33.090]  Once again, shout out to my bro Pedro.
[14:33.250 --> 14:35.770]  Also extra big shout out to my buddy, Ross and Ryan.
[14:35.770 --> 14:39.890]  That was Ross and Ryan's, uh, premier debut on a video podcast.
[14:40.090 --> 14:43.810]  So what I'm getting at is we did a solvent list podcast episode, how to make
[14:43.810 --> 14:48.250]  Rosin at home where Pedro and Ross and Ryan and myself discussed, it was mainly
[14:48.250 --> 14:50.170]  Pedro and Ross and Ryan talking about it.
[14:50.410 --> 14:51.690]  Talked about making Rosin.
[14:51.890 --> 14:54.730]  We are going to do part two of that episode.
[14:54.930 --> 14:58.050]  What I would like from you is questions for that show.
[14:58.330 --> 15:02.370]  Watch the Rosin episode and whatever we did not cover the questions that
[15:02.370 --> 15:03.570]  are still on your mind.
[15:03.890 --> 15:05.810]  Please do send me those questions.
[15:05.810 --> 15:09.650]  You can email me at grow from your heart at hotmail.com is the best way to get
[15:09.650 --> 15:10.250]  them to me.
[15:10.610 --> 15:14.410]  Or if you're not going to email me, if you want to be lazy about it, throw the
[15:14.410 --> 15:16.130]  questions on the YouTube video.
[15:16.130 --> 15:19.770]  I usually don't take questions from YouTube, but it's a, it's a quick way to
[15:19.770 --> 15:20.010]  do it.
[15:20.010 --> 15:20.530]  It's right there.
[15:20.530 --> 15:21.490]  You're already there.
[15:21.690 --> 15:25.970]  Leave your followup questions on the Rosin video that is already on YouTube.
[15:26.170 --> 15:29.090]  And I will get Pedro to help us answer more questions.
[15:29.090 --> 15:31.970]  I'll get Ross and Ryan on to help us more answer more questions.
[15:32.210 --> 15:34.330]  We will do solventless part two.
[15:34.330 --> 15:37.970]  So please send me your concentrate making questions to my email address.
[15:37.970 --> 15:39.730]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[15:39.970 --> 15:40.770]  Disclaimer.
[15:40.850 --> 15:44.410]  We will not talk about a butane extraction.
[15:44.410 --> 15:48.930]  There will be no carb hydrocarbon extraction discussion on the podcast in
[15:48.930 --> 15:49.490]  that episode.
[15:49.490 --> 15:52.090]  I don't want to teach you how to hurt yourself, how to blow anything up.
[15:52.330 --> 15:56.170]  We've got to teach you how to do it solventless with water, with pressure,
[15:56.210 --> 15:56.770]  with heat.
[15:56.890 --> 15:57.850]  We'll do it that way.
[15:58.050 --> 16:01.730]  A little bit safer in my opinion, also probably more legal.
[16:01.850 --> 16:04.130]  And I won't get any trouble for teaching you how to do that.
[16:04.450 --> 16:05.330]  Where are we now?
[16:05.330 --> 16:10.210]  This is the part of the show where I dig into this beautiful pile of emails.
[16:10.210 --> 16:12.690]  Yes, I do get a lot of emails, a lot of grow questions.
[16:12.970 --> 16:16.050]  Once again, the email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[16:16.050 --> 16:20.170]  There's also a grow help tab on the website at ireenetics.com.
[16:20.370 --> 16:21.490]  Click on the grow help tab.
[16:21.490 --> 16:23.690]  We do ask you several preliminary questions.
[16:23.970 --> 16:24.770]  What are you growing?
[16:24.770 --> 16:25.610]  Are you growing indoors?
[16:25.610 --> 16:26.410]  You're growing outdoors.
[16:26.410 --> 16:27.610]  What is your VPD?
[16:27.810 --> 16:30.330]  Then we give you an opportunity to ask your grow question.
[16:30.530 --> 16:33.850]  If you've got a question that is not grow based, skip all that stuff up there at the
[16:33.850 --> 16:36.170]  top, type in your question at the bottom, hit send.
[16:36.330 --> 16:39.930]  All of those questions do go to my email inbox and I do get to them.
[16:40.170 --> 16:43.810]  Ah, there are a lot of questions and there's only one of me and there are only two
[16:43.810 --> 16:44.650]  episodes a week.
[16:44.850 --> 16:46.890]  If I haven't answered your question, please be patient.
[16:47.170 --> 16:47.770]  I'll get to it.
[16:47.770 --> 16:48.370]  It's coming up.
[16:48.410 --> 16:50.130]  I will answer your stuff on the show.
[16:50.610 --> 16:51.570]  Let's get right to the point.
[16:51.570 --> 16:53.210]  I do have a good question here in front of me.
[16:53.490 --> 16:55.570]  This one goes a little bit like this.
[16:55.570 --> 16:59.050]  This one came from our friend Jamie and it even says, it's cool to mention my name.
[16:59.050 --> 16:59.810]  That makes it easy.
[16:59.810 --> 17:03.290]  It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I hope all is well with you, bro.
[17:03.290 --> 17:04.090]  Things are great.
[17:04.330 --> 17:05.770]  I'm smoking dabs out of it.
[17:05.770 --> 17:08.490]  I'm smoking lemon Jeffrey dabs out of a brand new rig.
[17:08.770 --> 17:10.570]  Uh, life could not get much better.
[17:10.770 --> 17:11.450]  Uh, feel good.
[17:11.450 --> 17:11.890]  Look good.
[17:11.890 --> 17:12.970]  Hanging out with you guys.
[17:13.170 --> 17:14.050]  I'm well hydrated.
[17:14.050 --> 17:15.050]  I'm drinking kombucha, dude.
[17:15.050 --> 17:16.370]  I cannot complain.
[17:16.690 --> 17:18.570]  It says, thanks for everything you do.
[17:18.570 --> 17:19.810]  You are very welcome, my friend.
[17:19.810 --> 17:20.890]  Thank you for the support.
[17:21.490 --> 17:22.970]  Thank you for the compliment.
[17:22.970 --> 17:27.530]  It says you've been a great help in the garden and a cure for boredom at a very
[17:27.570 --> 17:29.930]  tedious job at a, I'm not going to say where your job is.
[17:29.930 --> 17:30.450]  We'll skip that.
[17:30.450 --> 17:31.410]  We'll keep you a little bit safe.
[17:31.690 --> 17:33.290]  Uh, the dude's got a boring job.
[17:33.290 --> 17:34.170]  I understand that.
[17:34.410 --> 17:37.970]  Uh, I've worked in commercial cultivation facilities where, uh, the whole
[17:37.970 --> 17:39.730]  day our job is to defoliate.
[17:39.730 --> 17:40.090]  Yes.
[17:40.330 --> 17:43.250]  A lot of times I am the manager, I'm the consultant, but guess what?
[17:43.450 --> 17:44.170]  I got hands.
[17:44.170 --> 17:44.730]  I got eyes.
[17:44.730 --> 17:45.450]  I got gloves.
[17:45.450 --> 17:46.610]  I'll defoliate with the crew.
[17:46.610 --> 17:49.290]  I'll get on there and fucking try to go faster than everybody
[17:49.290 --> 17:50.290]  else and challenge people.
[17:50.290 --> 17:51.570]  So they try to go faster than me.
[17:51.570 --> 17:52.170]  Then guess what?
[17:52.530 --> 17:53.730]  Work gets done more quickly.
[17:53.730 --> 17:54.770]  We all feel good about it.
[17:54.770 --> 17:57.410]  So, um, I do understand that a tedious day can happen.
[17:57.410 --> 18:01.530]  I would put on a podcast, listen to some, uh, Joey Diaz, some dude grows,
[18:01.770 --> 18:04.970]  uh, maybe some Rogan back in the day and just let them ramble right now.
[18:04.970 --> 18:08.770]  I really love to listen to, uh, the Anthony Jeselnik, uh, it's the, uh,
[18:08.810 --> 18:11.010]  Jeselnik Rosenthal vanity project.
[18:11.050 --> 18:11.930]  J RVP.
[18:12.250 --> 18:13.490]  Uh, if you listen to it, you know what I'm talking about?
[18:13.490 --> 18:13.930]  It's a good show.
[18:13.930 --> 18:14.610]  I enjoy that one.
[18:14.610 --> 18:17.210]  Also anything with fucking Mark Norman and Chris DeStefano.
[18:17.490 --> 18:19.170]  I can listen to all day to those.
[18:19.370 --> 18:22.130]  Anyway, our friend does listen to podcast to cure boredom.
[18:22.130 --> 18:22.530]  Thank you.
[18:22.530 --> 18:25.450]  I'm glad that I'm getting you through a long day in your factory job.
[18:26.130 --> 18:28.490]  I listen Monday through Friday, bro.
[18:28.490 --> 18:30.610]  You're probably way caught up right now.
[18:31.290 --> 18:35.850]  It says, I feel your podcast is, uh, two above the rest.
[18:35.850 --> 18:38.090]  I may, I'm not sure what the two means, but it's a man.
[18:38.090 --> 18:39.370]  It says two above the rest.
[18:39.610 --> 18:40.090]  Uh, thank you.
[18:40.090 --> 18:41.250]  I like being two above the rest.
[18:41.250 --> 18:44.570]  I'm not sure if that's a typo or if that, uh, if I'm really two above the rest,
[18:44.850 --> 18:48.450]  it says being in a newly legal state, I've been mentioning you to all of my
[18:48.450 --> 18:51.090]  friends that are growers and they love the show, bro.
[18:51.090 --> 18:51.530]  Thank you.
[18:51.530 --> 18:53.930]  I love the organic growth of the show.
[18:54.210 --> 18:55.810]  I don't spend money on advertising.
[18:55.810 --> 18:58.090]  I don't put myself in magazines or anything like that.
[18:58.090 --> 18:59.130]  I don't pay for ads.
[18:59.370 --> 19:02.410]  The way that the show grows is through word of mouth from listeners.
[19:02.410 --> 19:03.130]  So thank you.
[19:03.130 --> 19:04.330]  That means a lot to me.
[19:04.690 --> 19:08.890]  Uh, hopefully you told 10 people, maybe two of those 10 people will tell two more
[19:08.890 --> 19:09.410]  people.
[19:09.610 --> 19:10.770]  Then you see how it goes.
[19:10.770 --> 19:12.610]  It's a snowball and avalanche effect.
[19:12.850 --> 19:14.050]  I hope more people are listening.
[19:14.050 --> 19:16.450]  Thank you for being that catalyst right there.
[19:16.450 --> 19:19.130]  It goes on to say, uh, all of my friends love the show.
[19:19.130 --> 19:22.410]  I've been in grow shops where brand new growers come in, very confused on what to
[19:22.410 --> 19:22.930]  do.
[19:23.090 --> 19:26.170]  And me and the store owner direct them to your grow series.
[19:26.170 --> 19:26.690]  Thank you, bro.
[19:26.690 --> 19:27.570]  That is awesome.
[19:27.850 --> 19:29.290]  Then he said enough of this.
[19:29.530 --> 19:32.810]  Uh, then he says my friend that owns the grow store, bro, thank you for the huge
[19:32.810 --> 19:35.290]  compliments, by the way, I'm not going to glaze over that.
[19:35.370 --> 19:35.850]  Thank you.
[19:35.850 --> 19:39.930]  And now the question says, my friend that owns a grow store is having major issues
[19:39.930 --> 19:41.250]  with spider mites.
[19:41.530 --> 19:44.570]  I come and visit him a few times a month, maybe more.
[19:44.810 --> 19:49.130]  And now I am apprehensive to do so because I do not want to drag them into my grow.
[19:49.130 --> 19:52.010]  He is my friend and I don't think it's the coolest thing to do to him.
[19:52.010 --> 19:53.210]  And I don't want to do that.
[19:53.210 --> 19:56.610]  I thought about this today when I saw a leaf all beat up while full of your
[19:56.610 --> 19:57.090]  feeding.
[19:57.410 --> 20:01.450]  Um, it's not spider mites, but it got me thinking there are obvious precautions I
[20:01.450 --> 20:05.450]  can take, but being a new grower, there might be some not so obvious precautions
[20:05.450 --> 20:05.890]  I can take.
[20:05.890 --> 20:09.250]  And I wanted to ask for your great advice.
[20:09.250 --> 20:09.810]  Thanks again.
[20:09.810 --> 20:10.650]  Keep it going.
[20:10.850 --> 20:11.610]  You're doing great.
[20:11.610 --> 20:14.370]  It is cool to mention my name from your friend, Jamie.
[20:14.370 --> 20:15.850]  Jamie, this is a great question.
[20:16.250 --> 20:18.130]  Uh, how do we not trade spider mites?
[20:18.130 --> 20:20.890]  Your friend that owns the grow store is having a major issue with spider mites.
[20:20.890 --> 20:25.730]  Isn't that funny that the guy that owns the store that has every single product
[20:25.730 --> 20:30.570]  available to him that has every single vendor on speed dial has not figured out
[20:30.570 --> 20:32.010]  how do we eradicate the spider mites?
[20:32.010 --> 20:32.810]  That's really funny.
[20:32.810 --> 20:35.930]  Every product that he could imagine, he can order it and he could get it.
[20:35.930 --> 20:37.610]  And he could probably reach right there.
[20:37.610 --> 20:38.570]  It's probably right there.
[20:38.650 --> 20:39.730]  You could read the instructions.
[20:39.730 --> 20:40.770]  He could apply everything.
[20:40.890 --> 20:42.770]  You could do something every other day if you wanted to.
[20:42.770 --> 20:44.170]  And he still hasn't beat the spider mites.
[20:44.650 --> 20:45.690]  That to me is funny.
[20:45.690 --> 20:48.730]  That's like when they say that the mechanics car is always the last one to get
[20:48.730 --> 20:49.170]  the work.
[20:49.170 --> 20:50.530]  Isn't that the damn truth?
[20:50.770 --> 20:51.050]  All right.
[20:51.050 --> 20:54.570]  So your buddy's got a major issue with spider mites and you are apprehensive to
[20:54.570 --> 20:55.250]  go over there.
[20:55.250 --> 20:58.690]  That is, um, that's, that's not a problem.
[20:58.690 --> 20:59.850]  That's a very wise move.
[20:59.850 --> 21:01.290]  That's a very smart thing to think.
[21:01.570 --> 21:04.410]  Uh, you don't want to put your crop at risk by hanging out with your friend who's
[21:04.410 --> 21:05.650]  got a problematic crop.
[21:06.090 --> 21:10.530]  I would first of all, be a bro and kind of encourage your friend to get those mites
[21:10.530 --> 21:11.210]  under control.
[21:11.210 --> 21:12.490]  I would think of a strategy.
[21:12.490 --> 21:14.370]  I'd be like, bro, we've got to fix this.
[21:14.650 --> 21:16.690]  Uh, you own the store.
[21:16.690 --> 21:17.530]  You're better than this.
[21:17.530 --> 21:18.410]  We're better than this.
[21:18.410 --> 21:19.450]  It's 2022.
[21:19.490 --> 21:20.610]  We've got better tools.
[21:20.610 --> 21:21.530]  We can do research.
[21:21.530 --> 21:22.650]  We've got to beat this.
[21:22.930 --> 21:26.370]  I'd help him develop an integrated pest management strategy that will get rid of
[21:26.370 --> 21:27.090]  those bugs.
[21:27.370 --> 21:28.290]  He works at the store.
[21:28.290 --> 21:31.730]  There are probably 82 different products there that he could use in a rotation in
[21:31.730 --> 21:35.250]  conjunction to knock out any fucking problem really quickly.
[21:35.250 --> 21:38.370]  So let's encourage him to get a strategy to beat those bugs.
[21:38.690 --> 21:42.250]  Now, the hardest part in life is making other people do what we want and that's
[21:42.250 --> 21:43.290]  not even cool anyway.
[21:43.410 --> 21:45.970]  So let's talk about what you can do.
[21:46.050 --> 21:49.370]  Um, I would just have, this is what you should do.
[21:49.370 --> 21:51.930]  You should have a, not should, this is what I would recommend.
[21:52.050 --> 21:53.050]  I can't tell you what you should do.
[21:53.050 --> 21:54.170]  I can tell you what you could do.
[21:54.490 --> 21:59.130]  Uh, you could set up an integrated pest management strategy that will outpower
[21:59.210 --> 22:00.650]  his pest problem.
[22:00.650 --> 22:02.290]  That's what you're probably going to need to do.
[22:02.730 --> 22:06.210]  Uh, when you go to his place, if you go to his place, when you come back home,
[22:06.490 --> 22:09.970]  uh, change your clothes before you go into your grow space, change everything.
[22:10.250 --> 22:13.290]  Uh, the shoes, socks, pants, undies, if you can.
[22:13.410 --> 22:13.810]  Sure.
[22:13.850 --> 22:14.330]  Hoodie.
[22:14.450 --> 22:15.450]  I've got dreadlocks, bro.
[22:15.450 --> 22:17.450]  So I'd be in there fucking shaking my dreads out.
[22:17.650 --> 22:18.890]  I'd wrap the dreads up in a hat.
[22:18.890 --> 22:23.410]  When I go to that crow or his house, I'd come home, take off that hat, shake
[22:23.410 --> 22:26.330]  that dreads out, put them in a different hat, put on different clothes.
[22:26.330 --> 22:29.290]  If you can rinse everything off and take a shower, I would do that.
[22:29.290 --> 22:33.370]  Put on different clothes before you go into your grow space at this time, all
[22:33.370 --> 22:37.090]  those clothes with the bugs should be in the laundry room and a dirty clothes
[22:37.090 --> 22:39.170]  area, maybe already in the washer.
[22:39.170 --> 22:41.490]  Maybe you dropped them in the dryer so you could heat them up and cook all the
[22:41.490 --> 22:41.970]  bugs.
[22:42.370 --> 22:45.690]  Uh, get rid of those clothes and put on fresh clothes before you go into the
[22:45.690 --> 22:46.450]  grow space.
[22:46.890 --> 22:48.530]  Don't take anything to his place.
[22:48.530 --> 22:51.170]  That's going to go into your grow is what I think I'm trying to say.
[22:51.570 --> 22:55.330]  Then the next step is a responsible farmer is to have an integrated pest
[22:55.330 --> 22:56.530]  management strategy.
[22:57.490 --> 22:59.130]  I don't know if you're an organic grower.
[22:59.130 --> 23:00.410]  I don't know if you're a salt grower.
[23:00.410 --> 23:02.250]  I don't know if you're a guy doing both.
[23:02.530 --> 23:06.050]  Uh, if you're a hybrid style grower, I don't know what you're doing, but I
[23:06.050 --> 23:09.090]  would work on a strategy to make sure you don't get those bugs.
[23:09.090 --> 23:13.770]  It can be a pesticide rotation, a sprayed pesticide application rotation.
[23:14.210 --> 23:17.050]  I would choose two or three, three or four different products.
[23:17.050 --> 23:20.730]  Maybe find a few things you can mix, uh, apply those every Monday.
[23:20.930 --> 23:24.730]  Uh, if you start seeing a problem, step up your game and apply every Monday and
[23:24.730 --> 23:25.930]  Thursday, I would rotate.
[23:26.170 --> 23:29.330]  I would do one product on Monday, a different product on Thursday, a
[23:29.330 --> 23:30.450]  different product on Monday.
[23:30.450 --> 23:32.770]  And if you only have three, start the rotation over.
[23:32.770 --> 23:36.370]  If you can mix a couple of things, mix two things, hit them on Monday, hit them
[23:36.370 --> 23:37.930]  with a third product on Thursday.
[23:37.930 --> 23:41.610]  If you can do what I'm saying is they will build resistance to the same
[23:41.610 --> 23:42.010]  product.
[23:42.010 --> 23:45.170]  If you hit them more than two or three times with the same product, they'll
[23:45.170 --> 23:46.850]  start saying, Oh, I know how to take that.
[23:47.010 --> 23:47.890]  You throw a left hook.
[23:47.890 --> 23:49.090]  They know how to block the left hook.
[23:49.090 --> 23:53.130]  You got to go left hook, right cross, uppercut, or some shit, mix them up.
[23:53.290 --> 23:54.890]  So they don't know how to block you every day.
[23:54.890 --> 23:56.130]  They will build resistance.
[23:56.410 --> 24:00.130]  Uh, get in there with multiple modes of attack, um, different products,
[24:00.130 --> 24:03.650]  different plans, different strategies for different bugs, but have a plan,
[24:03.650 --> 24:06.170]  have a strategy, have a rotation of pesticides.
[24:06.490 --> 24:10.090]  Uh, keep your room clean, keep your clothes clean, keep your tools clean,
[24:10.490 --> 24:12.010]  all of your equipment when you're done.
[24:12.290 --> 24:14.330]  Um, let's talk about, you're talking about bugs.
[24:14.330 --> 24:15.810]  Let's talk about viruses right now.
[24:15.810 --> 24:19.690]  Everybody's getting the, the dreaded tobacco mosaic virus.
[24:19.690 --> 24:21.930]  There's another hop late and viroid is also out there.
[24:22.090 --> 24:23.090]  Everybody's getting that.
[24:23.330 --> 24:27.050]  Let's talk about how to prevent the spread of the virus in our room between.
[24:27.410 --> 24:28.850]  Uh, it's really hard to do it.
[24:28.850 --> 24:33.330]  If you can clean your scissors between every single plant, I recommend cleaning
[24:33.330 --> 24:37.810]  scissors with ISO, uh, with rubbing alcohol between every single plant, if
[24:37.810 --> 24:41.090]  possible. If you've got a mom plant, you're cutting clones off of it.
[24:41.250 --> 24:44.010]  You're going to move to another plant, clean your scissors.
[24:44.170 --> 24:48.450]  That way we don't take the virus from plant a to plant B clean the plants
[24:48.450 --> 24:52.530]  between clean the scissors between every plant, if possible, it's going to slow
[24:52.530 --> 24:56.690]  you down. It's going to take time, but viruses will take a lot more time and
[24:56.690 --> 24:58.930]  slow you down a lot more. So do the preventative work.
[24:59.330 --> 25:02.450]  Uh, if you're working in rows, if you're doing long rows, if you're in a
[25:02.450 --> 25:05.770]  commercial grow, maybe, maybe change your scissors, clean your scissors after
[25:05.770 --> 25:08.130]  every row. I understand the boss is going to get crazy.
[25:08.130 --> 25:11.010]  If you're fucking cutting a plant, clean your scissors, cut a plant, clean your
[25:11.010 --> 25:14.410]  scissors. I get it. It takes time, but we don't want to ruin crops.
[25:14.410 --> 25:18.530]  So clean up after yourself and get a pest management strategy.
[25:18.770 --> 25:23.410]  Clean up after yourself, clean yourself before you go in there and seal up the
[25:23.410 --> 25:25.890]  room. Where are the bugs going to come in into that room?
[25:25.890 --> 25:28.650]  Have you sealed all the cracks, the crevices, the nooks and crannies?
[25:29.010 --> 25:31.890]  Uh, is there debris? Is there junk? Is there trash in the grow space?
[25:31.930 --> 25:35.570]  That will really encourage bugs to be around. How about, uh,
[25:35.570 --> 25:39.530]  if let's hypothetically save it on the other side of this, that's a backyard
[25:39.530 --> 25:41.130]  back there behind that just full disclosure.
[25:41.130 --> 25:43.810]  Nobody probably knows what's behind that curtain. That's the backyard.
[25:43.810 --> 25:46.730]  Let's hypothetically say that's a grow room. Just it's not,
[25:46.730 --> 25:48.650]  but we're going to invent a grow room back there.
[25:48.970 --> 25:52.090]  Let's just say that's a grow space. I would clean up all of right here as well.
[25:52.090 --> 25:56.010]  There would be no junk, no debris, no boxes, no trash, no paper.
[25:56.370 --> 25:58.490]  I wouldn't have it looking like the garage.
[25:58.490 --> 26:01.690]  I wouldn't have it looking like the basement where you got shit stored or the
[26:01.690 --> 26:05.810]  old drum sets are sitting where there's especially like clothing and blankets
[26:05.810 --> 26:09.970]  and trinkets and shit like that. Soft things where bugs like to hide, um,
[26:10.170 --> 26:12.490]  wood things that smell good. Some wood doesn't smell good.
[26:12.490 --> 26:15.570]  Some wood is inviting to bugs, things like dirt and things like that.
[26:15.570 --> 26:19.250]  Places where bugs and spiders want to go. Don't have that type of environment.
[26:19.250 --> 26:22.930]  Have a clean, organized, swept environment that you can clean up and make sure
[26:22.930 --> 26:24.250]  there's no bugs, no pests.
[26:24.570 --> 26:28.650]  Every little nook and cranny and hiding spot is a place for a bug to hide.
[26:28.930 --> 26:31.010]  Uh, they'll make a party. If you got leaves on the floor,
[26:31.010 --> 26:33.410]  they're going to go eat up those leaves on the floor. They're going to breed.
[26:33.730 --> 26:35.330]  Then as soon as you disrupt those leaves,
[26:35.490 --> 26:37.730]  they're going to go scattering in the room. Guess where they're going?
[26:38.010 --> 26:40.690]  Your plants are going to go right to those fresh green plants.
[26:40.970 --> 26:42.250]  They're going to head to the weakest leaves.
[26:42.250 --> 26:44.450]  They're going to start chewing up those weak leaves on your plants.
[26:44.690 --> 26:46.570]  Then they're going to breed. They're going to have a party.
[26:46.570 --> 26:50.970]  So the main thing you should do is when you go to that house or that friends
[26:50.970 --> 26:55.490]  grow, or even that grow store where he is, um, remember he's infected,
[26:55.490 --> 26:57.370]  he's contaminated. When you leave,
[26:57.370 --> 26:59.690]  don't take clothes there that you're going to wear into your grow.
[26:59.690 --> 27:03.210]  I would maybe have a separate set of clothes to go see that person. Uh,
[27:03.250 --> 27:06.770]  then when you go see that person change clothes, right after take a shower,
[27:06.770 --> 27:11.490]  before you go into your grow space, maybe have dedicated shoes, pants, a shirt,
[27:11.530 --> 27:13.890]  a hoodie, a hat, glasses, and gloves,
[27:13.890 --> 27:16.370]  and whatever else you need for your grow space.
[27:16.370 --> 27:19.570]  Don't take that other stuff into there have dedicated tools.
[27:19.570 --> 27:23.850]  Don't move tools from that grow area to another grow area, to the outdoor,
[27:23.850 --> 27:27.250]  to the indoor, just buy the extra, buy one tool for every space.
[27:27.290 --> 27:30.610]  You need scissors and that grow, that grow, that grow a pH pin for every grow.
[27:30.890 --> 27:34.130]  Don't move the shit around. You're just moving problems around that way. Uh,
[27:34.170 --> 27:39.250]  and then think about like just basic pest management, seal the room. Uh,
[27:39.290 --> 27:41.650]  don't go on a hike and then walk into the grow space.
[27:41.890 --> 27:44.930]  Basic pest management will get you a long way.
[27:45.090 --> 27:48.130]  Let me see if I've covered your question because you basically asked how not to
[27:48.130 --> 27:52.890]  bring home those mites. Um, just, uh, protect yourself just like, uh,
[27:53.170 --> 27:55.810]  just like any other way of life. I'm trying not to say it,
[27:55.810 --> 27:58.570]  but just like you don't want to get an STD. Think about the precautions,
[27:58.770 --> 28:01.170]  things you need to do so that you don't bring that stuff home.
[28:01.170 --> 28:03.970]  Spider mites are like the herpes of the grow world.
[28:04.130 --> 28:07.530]  Let's not bring that shit home. All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
[28:07.530 --> 28:11.570]  pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen, chuckers,
[28:11.810 --> 28:13.730]  all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[28:13.730 --> 28:17.370]  I feel like I've been rambling long enough to make this a successful podcast.
[28:17.370 --> 28:18.970]  There's no need to ruin it at this point.
