[00:01.150 --> 00:06.270]  Hey everyone, this is Dab and Granny, and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart
[00:06.270 --> 00:07.270]  podcast.
[00:07.270 --> 00:25.160]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:25.160 --> 00:29.680]  It's time for episode number 211 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:29.680 --> 00:31.200]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:31.200 --> 00:35.440]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:35.440 --> 00:39.640]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.800]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:44.800 --> 00:46.600]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:46.600 --> 00:48.760]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.120]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:52.120 --> 00:54.840]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:54.840 --> 01:01.080]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me is White Mike.
[01:03.200 --> 01:04.200]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.200]  You're welcome, man.
[01:05.200 --> 01:06.200]  Thanks for having me.
[01:06.200 --> 01:07.680]  Oh man, thanks for coming, taking some time away from the new kid.
[01:07.680 --> 01:08.680]  Yeah.
[01:08.720 --> 01:09.720]  How's he doing, bro?
[01:09.720 --> 01:10.720]  He's doing so well.
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.720]  Good, good.
[01:11.720 --> 01:14.720]  So, hit a bunch of new milestones this week, so it's been a lot of fun.
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.720]  How old is he this week?
[01:15.720 --> 01:17.200]  He's almost two.
[01:17.200 --> 01:18.200]  Almost two.
[01:18.200 --> 01:19.520]  Is the terrible twos kicking in?
[01:19.520 --> 01:20.520]  Oh, so much.
[01:20.520 --> 01:21.520]  So much.
[01:21.520 --> 01:23.200]  Wait till you get to the fucking terrorizing threes.
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.320]  He think two is bad, three is when it kicks in, dude.
[01:25.320 --> 01:26.320]  Right.
[01:26.320 --> 01:27.800]  All right, we're not going to talk about kids the whole podcast.
[01:27.800 --> 01:28.800]  That was it.
[01:28.800 --> 01:29.800]  I wanted to get it out of the way.
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.600]  I do respect Mike for coming and taking time away from his family.
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.760]  He had to walk away from that little boy who's a handsome little fucker.
[01:35.760 --> 01:36.760]  I'm sure he's fun to play with.
[01:36.760 --> 01:38.440]  Oh, dude, it's so much fun.
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.520]  That's one of the things that I would tell you, dude, being a parent is a lot of fun.
[01:41.520 --> 01:42.520]  It is.
[01:42.520 --> 01:43.520]  It is a lot of fun.
[01:43.520 --> 01:45.640]  My kid's 13 now, and it's a totally different kind of fun.
[01:45.640 --> 01:46.640]  Now she can talk shit to me.
[01:46.640 --> 01:47.640]  Right.
[01:47.640 --> 01:50.080]  We like troll each other a little bit and send each other emojis of elephants farting
[01:50.080 --> 01:51.320]  in monkeys' faces and stuff.
[01:51.320 --> 01:52.320]  Nice.
[01:52.320 --> 01:53.320]  It's a fun relationship with my kid.
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.320]  Shout out to my kiddo if she ever listens to this damn podcast.
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.440]  She has no reason to listen.
[01:56.440 --> 01:58.920]  She doesn't care about cannabis at all.
[01:58.920 --> 01:59.920]  That's enough kid talk.
[01:59.920 --> 02:00.920]  Let's talk about ganja.
[02:00.920 --> 02:02.400]  Bro, are you okay after those dabs?
[02:02.400 --> 02:03.400]  I'm good.
[02:03.400 --> 02:07.280]  Man, shout out to my friends at Apothecary Extracts and also my friends at Elevations,
[02:07.280 --> 02:10.760]  a dispensary in Colorado Springs on Razorback.
[02:10.760 --> 02:15.040]  Today I was at work and I received a text message that there was a secret drop of some
[02:15.040 --> 02:20.200]  Lemon Jeffery high cannabinoid full spectrum extract and also some high terpene full spectrum
[02:20.200 --> 02:22.720]  extract.
[02:22.720 --> 02:27.880]  I zipped up there after work and I bought fucking all of it.
[02:27.880 --> 02:31.800]  Shout out to my friends at Elevations for they didn't even put it on the shelf.
[02:31.800 --> 02:34.620]  They waited for me to get there and I scooped it all up.
[02:34.620 --> 02:36.900]  Just a moment ago I took a dab.
[02:36.900 --> 02:40.980]  So I heated the banger quite hot and I took a dab of THCA.
[02:40.980 --> 02:45.660]  I dumped some THCA crystals on there and then after that I dumped way too much.
[02:45.660 --> 02:48.300]  Way, like half the vial.
[02:48.300 --> 02:49.300]  It wouldn't come out, dude.
[02:49.300 --> 02:53.260]  And then I gave it like a little nudge and it just poured out and I was like, fuck, was
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.260]  the only thing on my brain.
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.260]  But I was like, I'm going to smoke that.
[02:55.260 --> 02:57.540]  Like a dollop of terpenes.
[02:57.540 --> 03:02.140]  I poured a big fat dollop of high terpene full spectrum extract onto the nail.
[03:02.140 --> 03:07.780]  Then on a dabber I had some high cannabinoid full spectrum extract also with some ambrosia
[03:07.780 --> 03:12.100]  and all of it was made from lemon Jeffrey except the THCA was made from another stream.
[03:12.100 --> 03:14.380]  But everything else came from some lemon Jeffrey.
[03:14.380 --> 03:16.420]  It still smells like lemon candy in here.
[03:16.420 --> 03:17.860]  The rig still smells like lemons.
[03:17.860 --> 03:21.660]  You can just pull through the rig and it tastes like lemon candy without any hash on it.
[03:21.660 --> 03:27.380]  I've been talking about the high cannabinoid and high terpene full spectrum extract.
[03:27.380 --> 03:31.540]  Now that I've got some of this high terpene full spectrum extract in my hand, let's talk
[03:31.540 --> 03:33.540]  a little bit about this.
[03:33.540 --> 03:35.700]  Let's describe this little vial of stuff to people.
[03:35.700 --> 03:40.260]  It's a half dram vial is the unit of measure this size would be.
[03:40.260 --> 03:41.540]  If you don't know what that is.
[03:41.540 --> 03:43.860]  How tall is that Mike?
[03:43.860 --> 03:44.860]  Without the lid.
[03:44.860 --> 03:46.900]  And three quarters of an inch.
[03:46.900 --> 03:50.820]  I was going to say half an inch small, but it's a half to three quarters of an inch tall.
[03:50.820 --> 03:55.260]  And the lid is almost a third of the size of the whole bottle.
[03:55.260 --> 04:02.900]  And it holds a gram of terpene, a high terpene, full cannabinoid, a full, this is hard to
[04:02.900 --> 04:06.380]  say high terpene full spectrum extracts in this one container.
[04:06.380 --> 04:09.140]  It was very well, reasonably priced.
[04:09.140 --> 04:12.300]  Does it look like really runny honey possibly?
[04:12.300 --> 04:13.300]  Yeah.
[04:13.300 --> 04:16.500]  Or maybe thick vegetable oil or thin vegetable oil.
[04:16.500 --> 04:20.860]  The runny honey is a good description that hits the color right on the mark.
[04:20.860 --> 04:24.020]  And it's way too runny for, for actual honey.
[04:24.780 --> 04:26.540]  It's got a light motor oil.
[04:26.540 --> 04:29.740]  It's like some five W 30, but real nice and clear.
[04:29.740 --> 04:32.060]  It was funny watching you try to dab it in motion.
[04:32.060 --> 04:36.780]  Well, I poured it out of that container into a banger, a quartz banger, and it puddled
[04:36.780 --> 04:37.780]  in there.
[04:37.780 --> 04:40.380]  And when I, when the dab hit my, I could hear the sizzle across the table.
[04:40.380 --> 04:41.380]  Yeah.
[04:41.380 --> 04:42.380]  Yeah.
[04:42.380 --> 04:44.540]  There's a lot of heat and a lot of liquid happening, but when the dab, when it hit that,
[04:44.540 --> 04:47.300]  it felt, I think effervescent is the word.
[04:47.300 --> 04:50.500]  My face was filled with the flavors of lemon Jeffrey.
[04:50.500 --> 04:53.940]  There was, I reached the maximum of flavor that your face can take.
[04:54.860 --> 04:56.020]  My face was like, that's such a good flavor.
[04:56.020 --> 04:58.340]  And then it went, Oh, that's way too much of it.
[04:58.340 --> 04:59.340]  Yeah.
[04:59.340 --> 05:03.740]  I've seen you take huge dabs before and you don't usually find them like that.
[05:03.740 --> 05:04.740]  Yeah.
[05:04.740 --> 05:07.700]  I had to keep, like, I wanted to finish the dab, but I had to keep forcing my lungs to
[05:07.700 --> 05:08.700]  like inhale that.
[05:08.700 --> 05:12.860]  And they were like, but dude, like, it's like if you put vapor rub on the tip of your nose
[05:12.860 --> 05:15.620]  and then tried to take a dab, you're like, I'm having a hard time.
[05:15.620 --> 05:18.100]  My lungs don't want to breathe that in real heavily.
[05:18.100 --> 05:19.100]  Right.
[05:19.100 --> 05:20.100]  It was a great dab.
[05:20.100 --> 05:21.260]  Then I gave Mike a similar dab.
[05:21.260 --> 05:25.660]  I didn't put as many things on there because I don't want to kill Mike.
[05:25.660 --> 05:29.300]  We're shooting for a tighter, more succinct show tonight.
[05:29.300 --> 05:31.740]  So not getting super baked was part of the goal.
[05:31.740 --> 05:33.260]  Hopefully there aren't as many rambles.
[05:33.260 --> 05:36.820]  Hopefully there's a little, we're already off to a rambly start, but I had to explain
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.820]  these dabs.
[05:37.820 --> 05:38.820]  These dabs were tremendous.
[05:38.820 --> 05:40.620]  We're having so much fun, folks.
[05:40.620 --> 05:41.900]  We're so spoiled here.
[05:41.900 --> 05:45.140]  You should come check out what we got going on in Colorado.
[05:45.140 --> 05:46.140]  Yeah.
[05:46.140 --> 05:47.140]  Come visit Colorado.
[05:47.140 --> 05:48.140]  Take a few dabs and then go home.
[05:48.140 --> 05:49.140]  Don't move here.
[05:49.140 --> 05:50.140]  It's crowded.
[05:50.140 --> 05:51.140]  Everything sucks.
[05:51.140 --> 05:52.420]  I'm going to be with my friends in the Mystic Roots band.
[05:52.420 --> 05:53.420]  Yeah.
[05:53.420 --> 05:54.420]  There's a rule now.
[05:54.420 --> 05:57.340]  If you want to move to Colorado, you have to trick someone into moving somewhere else.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.340]  Yes.
[05:58.340 --> 05:59.340]  Two people.
[05:59.340 --> 06:00.340]  Yep.
[06:00.340 --> 06:01.340]  And don't drive on I-25 or I-70.
[06:01.340 --> 06:05.340]  Promise that you won't go anywhere near I-25 or I-70 because it's already packed.
[06:05.340 --> 06:09.700]  I had to drive up to Springs today to go pick up this hash and it should be a 45 minute
[06:09.700 --> 06:14.820]  drive thanks to the lovely weather and surprise turns and shit traffic in Colorado.
[06:14.820 --> 06:17.540]  It took me closer to an hour and 15.
[06:17.540 --> 06:20.420]  There are rules that you have to be inside the dispensary by a certain time.
[06:20.420 --> 06:22.020]  You have to be rung up by a certain time.
[06:22.020 --> 06:25.380]  I looked like an asshole because I was pushing the fucking limits.
[06:25.380 --> 06:28.340]  If I didn't know what I want already, they might have been mad at me for going in there
[06:28.340 --> 06:30.140]  at that last very second.
[06:30.140 --> 06:31.140]  Right.
[06:31.140 --> 06:32.940]  They've got to be closed all the way up by what, seven?
[06:32.940 --> 06:33.940]  Yes.
[06:33.940 --> 06:38.900]  The last person's got to be out the door locked up by 655, which means if you're not in the
[06:38.900 --> 06:41.100]  building by 620, you're a dick.
[06:41.100 --> 06:42.100]  630-ish.
[06:42.100 --> 06:43.100]  Yeah.
[06:43.100 --> 06:46.100]  It was 632-ish when I was getting out of the car and I got off work at five and just zipped
[06:46.100 --> 06:47.100]  up there.
[06:47.100 --> 06:48.100]  It took me all that time to get there.
[06:48.100 --> 06:49.100]  I didn't stop for gas.
[06:49.100 --> 06:50.100]  I didn't pee.
[06:50.780 --> 06:51.780]  I didn't do anything I needed.
[06:51.780 --> 06:52.780]  It still took me forever.
[06:52.780 --> 06:53.780]  I've made that drive a couple of times.
[06:53.780 --> 06:54.780]  Yeah.
[06:54.780 --> 06:55.780]  That dab is working.
[06:55.780 --> 06:56.780]  It made me sweaty.
[06:56.780 --> 06:59.780]  It made me very euphorically high and it made me chatty.
[06:59.780 --> 07:00.780]  I can still taste it.
[07:00.780 --> 07:03.780]  It's like lemon Starburst.
[07:03.780 --> 07:07.280]  I ate a whole bunch of lemon Starburst earlier and now I've just got that wonderful little
[07:07.280 --> 07:08.280]  after flavor.
[07:08.280 --> 07:11.620]  You know the side of the lemon meringue pie where it's a little more whipped cream and
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.660]  a little less lemon?
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.780]  That's kind of the flavor that it left in my mouth, I think.
[07:14.780 --> 07:15.780]  Nice.
[07:15.780 --> 07:16.780]  Yeah.
[07:16.780 --> 07:17.780]  Lemon meringue dabs.
[07:18.460 --> 07:22.220]  I couldn't have gotten my hash today if I did not get my medical marijuana card renewed
[07:22.220 --> 07:23.220]  yesterday.
[07:23.220 --> 07:26.900]  No, my card hasn't expired yet, but everybody in Colorado has been trained to be very proactive
[07:26.900 --> 07:32.100]  on getting their cards renewed because in the past it has taken fucking 10 to 12 weeks
[07:32.100 --> 07:33.100]  to get your card.
[07:33.100 --> 07:36.340]  When you send in the paperwork, it takes 12 weeks to get your card back.
[07:36.340 --> 07:42.220]  The CDPHE, the state department that sends them out, just got hammered in the press like
[07:42.220 --> 07:46.500]  a month and a half, two months ago because they were backed up again.
[07:46.580 --> 07:48.820]  I'm glad to see that that backlog is gone.
[07:48.820 --> 07:49.860]  Yes, they're catching up.
[07:49.860 --> 07:53.780]  I think they're about two weeks behind right now, but that's not too far.
[07:53.780 --> 07:59.120]  The problem in that is, let's say not everybody has a lot of extra money.
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.120]  You're running out of funds.
[08:00.120 --> 08:01.780]  You can't go to the medical marijuana doc.
[08:01.780 --> 08:03.660]  That's probably the bottom of several people's list.
[08:03.660 --> 08:07.700]  You got lights, you got the fucking car payment, you got the rent, you got whatever food you're
[08:07.700 --> 08:08.880]  going to eat this week.
[08:08.880 --> 08:11.060]  Maybe somewhere on there's the weed doctor at the end of the month.
[08:11.060 --> 08:15.020]  There was a lot of telling information in the order of those items, folks.
[08:15.020 --> 08:16.020]  Yeah, right.
[08:16.020 --> 08:18.020]  I'm just trying to-
[08:18.020 --> 08:21.020]  You got lights, rent.
[08:21.020 --> 08:22.020]  Yeah.
[08:22.020 --> 08:28.140]  Well, sometimes the lights are more expensive than the rent in some instances.
[08:28.140 --> 08:30.500]  Usually people list stuff in the order of personal importance.
[08:30.500 --> 08:32.380]  That was just cracking me up.
[08:32.380 --> 08:34.060]  You're like, man, I could have lights outside.
[08:34.060 --> 08:35.060]  I don't need rent.
[08:35.060 --> 08:38.620]  All right, we got sidetracked already.
[08:38.860 --> 08:39.860]  Dabs.
[08:39.860 --> 08:45.700]  So, if you get your medical marijuana card renewed at the time that it expires, there's
[08:45.700 --> 08:49.060]  going to be a long time waiting before your replacement card comes in.
[08:49.060 --> 08:52.980]  And you're not allowed to renew your card 30 days before it expires.
[08:52.980 --> 08:57.340]  So if it takes 32 days for that card to come in, you're two days without your medical marijuana
[08:57.340 --> 09:01.540]  card, which means if you're growing an elevated count or an increased count, which your doctor
[09:01.540 --> 09:05.700]  can give you if they do choose to do so based on your condition, you are now illegal for
[09:05.700 --> 09:07.220]  a few days until your card comes.
[09:07.220 --> 09:11.260]  You cannot shop in a dispensary if you need medicine until that card comes.
[09:11.260 --> 09:13.780]  It fucks a lot of things up and it was uncool.
[09:13.780 --> 09:14.780]  It was just shitty.
[09:14.780 --> 09:15.780]  It wasn't working.
[09:15.780 --> 09:16.780]  It was un...
[09:16.780 --> 09:17.780]  It wasn't organized.
[09:17.780 --> 09:18.780]  It wasn't right.
[09:18.780 --> 09:22.940]  There was a period of time where the backlog was almost a year, which in practice meant
[09:22.940 --> 09:25.620]  you got a free weed card for a year.
[09:25.620 --> 09:29.940]  But at that time, you were allowed to use the temporary paperwork to shop.
[09:29.940 --> 09:32.620]  They had to have different rules then because of that backlog.
[09:32.620 --> 09:34.420]  Now you can't shop with temporary paperwork.
[09:34.420 --> 09:37.500]  Now they're like, oh, bring that purple card or get the fuck out.
[09:37.500 --> 09:43.580]  The new restrictions on when you can renew and where, like when you can shop if you don't
[09:43.580 --> 09:48.980]  have your active card with you are part of the reason that the CDPHE took heat in the
[09:48.980 --> 09:53.140]  press because lots of people need these cards to buy their medicine.
[09:53.140 --> 09:58.420]  And if the backlog is longer than the allowed period to do it, you're screwing people badly.
[09:58.420 --> 09:59.420]  Absolutely.
[09:59.420 --> 10:00.980]  And people would come into the dispensary.
[10:00.980 --> 10:03.980]  When I was with Green and Healthy, I would take deliveries or I'd be there shopping and
[10:03.980 --> 10:06.260]  people would come in with their paperwork like, Hey, I've been waiting.
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.260]  Can I shop?
[10:07.260 --> 10:10.140]  And the bunt tenders would have to say, sorry, you can't come in here.
[10:10.140 --> 10:11.300]  They don't have to turn them away.
[10:11.300 --> 10:14.020]  And that looks like shit when you have to, they don't come back.
[10:14.020 --> 10:18.220]  Even though it's the state's rule and a rule that the dispensaries have to follow to stay
[10:18.220 --> 10:22.500]  in business, it pisses off the consumer because they don't have their medicine and they have
[10:22.500 --> 10:23.900]  to blame it on somebody.
[10:23.900 --> 10:27.140]  And so they blame that dispensary that won't let them shop there and they don't come back.
[10:27.140 --> 10:30.140]  You lose their business because of their paperwork.
[10:30.140 --> 10:32.900]  So the good thing, there is a positive now.
[10:32.900 --> 10:35.700]  I went to the medical marijuana doctor yesterday.
[10:35.700 --> 10:37.820]  My appointment was at one 20.
[10:37.820 --> 10:38.820]  It's the weed doc.
[10:38.820 --> 10:41.420]  So around three o'clock, I finally saw the fucking doctor.
[10:41.420 --> 10:42.420]  That's the bad.
[10:42.420 --> 10:45.580]  That's the worst part about going to the weed doctor is you make an appointment for, I made
[10:45.580 --> 10:46.980]  my appointment for one.
[10:46.980 --> 10:49.780]  They sent me my reminder saying that it was at one 20.
[10:49.780 --> 10:54.660]  I showed up at one 15 and at about three o'clock I finally saw the doc.
[10:54.660 --> 10:59.300]  The appointment took honestly five or 10 minutes because I've seen this guy 10 times.
[10:59.300 --> 11:00.300]  We have a relationship.
[11:00.300 --> 11:01.300]  We've, he's a bona fide.
[11:01.300 --> 11:02.660]  We've got a bona fide relationship.
[11:03.420 --> 11:04.420]  He's like, how's the paperwork annual?
[11:04.420 --> 11:05.420]  Yeah.
[11:05.420 --> 11:06.420]  Yeah.
[11:06.420 --> 11:07.580]  Basically the paperwork is way different.
[11:07.580 --> 11:10.820]  Now there are way more specific questions.
[11:10.820 --> 11:15.700]  They ask how much cannabis you use, what type you use, how you grow it, how much you yield
[11:15.700 --> 11:18.020]  per plant, how many harvests you get per year.
[11:18.020 --> 11:21.620]  If that's going to be turned into edibles or concentrates, how many of how much of that
[11:21.620 --> 11:23.540]  you're going to use per day, per hour.
[11:23.540 --> 11:25.420]  They ask a lot of shit.
[11:25.420 --> 11:30.020]  And then also there's a caregiver registry that you cannot become a caregiver now on
[11:30.380 --> 11:33.340]  somebody's paperwork unless you have a caregiver registry number.
[11:33.340 --> 11:38.460]  So if you're a caregiver in Colorado, you got to get your ass on the caregiver registry.
[11:38.460 --> 11:39.460]  That's easy.
[11:39.460 --> 11:42.020]  Just go to the Colorado department of public health and environment thing.
[11:42.020 --> 11:45.940]  Type in marijuana or just Google Colorado caregiver registry.
[11:45.940 --> 11:46.940]  All that shit will pop up.
[11:46.940 --> 11:48.540]  Make it really easy to find.
[11:48.540 --> 11:53.460]  So I did the basic paperwork and the lady behind the counter goes, you got enough of
[11:53.460 --> 11:54.460]  that.
[11:54.460 --> 11:55.460]  I can finish that out for you.
[11:55.460 --> 11:56.540]  And cause it's all just a cut and paste.
[11:56.540 --> 11:59.740]  She typed it into the computer from there and then filled out all the rest of the forms
[12:00.460 --> 12:01.940]  for me just by cutting and pasting.
[12:01.940 --> 12:05.700]  And then I pulled out my phone and went to a website that she gave me.
[12:05.700 --> 12:06.900]  I created a username.
[12:06.900 --> 12:08.060]  I got an email.
[12:08.060 --> 12:10.420]  I logged in through my email on my phone.
[12:10.420 --> 12:11.780]  I created a template.
[12:11.780 --> 12:13.660]  There was a draft.
[12:13.660 --> 12:14.700]  I saw the doc.
[12:14.700 --> 12:16.140]  He approved all my stuff.
[12:16.140 --> 12:20.860]  I took my stamped paperwork to a desk with the lady who took my credit card and ran it
[12:20.860 --> 12:25.020]  through the department of public health and public health and environment website.
[12:25.020 --> 12:28.660]  Charged me $16 and 10 cents for the card swiping to the state.
[12:28.660 --> 12:32.980]  I paid the doc a fee to get my doc visit plus my plant count.
[12:32.980 --> 12:37.140]  And then she turned in all of my paperwork by clicking a button on the thing.
[12:37.140 --> 12:39.940]  And then today at one o'clock I got an email saying, thank you.
[12:39.940 --> 12:40.940]  Your new card is activated.
[12:40.940 --> 12:43.580]  So I've got a brand new medical marijuana card today.
[12:43.580 --> 12:47.220]  It took less than 24 hours to have my card renewed and activated.
[12:47.220 --> 12:48.220]  That's impressive.
[12:48.220 --> 12:49.220]  Yeah.
[12:49.220 --> 12:52.380]  I can print it off if I need to, but some dispensaries will take it right off of my
[12:52.380 --> 12:53.380]  phone.
[12:53.380 --> 12:57.100]  They say they should not, but some places will take it right off of my phone.
[12:57.100 --> 12:58.100]  I should print that out.
[12:58.540 --> 12:59.860]  My old one doesn't expire for a month still.
[12:59.860 --> 13:01.620]  I've got three weeks, right?
[13:01.620 --> 13:05.060]  You were on it when I'm at the office one day at work and I think about it, I'm just
[13:05.060 --> 13:07.060]  going to print that shit out and then I've got my new card.
[13:07.060 --> 13:08.060]  Yeah.
[13:08.060 --> 13:12.660]  I, I made sure that I've got a reminder set in my phone for a month before my mind expires.
[13:12.660 --> 13:16.900]  Well, the, the reason you need a month reminder now is because the docs are so busy.
[13:16.900 --> 13:17.900]  Yep.
[13:17.900 --> 13:20.660]  It takes a month just to get into the medical marijuana doc.
[13:20.660 --> 13:24.820]  Especially if you are trying to receive an extended plant count or any sort of special
[13:24.820 --> 13:26.420]  treatment or anything like that.
[13:26.740 --> 13:30.260]  A lot of people ask just cause I'm, I got asked this question today.
[13:30.260 --> 13:36.500]  I've got a friend with a child who is under the age of 18 and is experiencing some conditions
[13:36.500 --> 13:42.220]  and symptoms that would be very easily treated by the use of medical cannabis.
[13:42.220 --> 13:43.760]  And I feel that it's the way to go.
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.380]  And they were like, we're ready to do it.
[13:45.380 --> 13:46.380]  How do we do this?
[13:46.380 --> 13:49.820]  They've been apprehensive for a while because of the law, but with the card, there's no
[13:49.820 --> 13:51.300]  reason not to do it.
[13:51.300 --> 13:55.140]  If you were under the age of 18, you need to be seen by two doctors to get your medical
[13:55.140 --> 13:56.140]  marijuana card.
[13:56.140 --> 13:58.180]  So you're going to have to pay two docs.
[13:58.180 --> 14:01.700]  And I don't know of many places that do two docs at one time.
[14:01.700 --> 14:03.780]  The place I go only has one doc on site.
[14:03.780 --> 14:04.780]  There are places.
[14:04.780 --> 14:08.980]  Uh, send me an email if you really need the info and I'll help you out, but I'm not going
[14:08.980 --> 14:13.940]  to give any companies a shout out on the show like that right now.
[14:13.940 --> 14:16.340]  I think I know two places.
[14:16.340 --> 14:18.700]  The younger, the patient, the more stringent it is.
[14:18.700 --> 14:24.540]  If you've, uh, for the, the really young kids coming to Colorado, um, it's gotta be two
[14:24.540 --> 14:25.540]  specialists.
[14:26.380 --> 14:29.940]  Um, which can be incredibly difficult for a lot of people.
[14:29.940 --> 14:32.660]  There are two people that two places that I think may do it.
[14:32.660 --> 14:33.860]  I just want to make sure.
[14:33.860 --> 14:37.620]  So I'm going to research that after the show, I'll contact them tomorrow or something.
[14:37.620 --> 14:41.420]  It's not too hard to just call them, uh, two local places, findable information.
[14:41.420 --> 14:43.380]  We have ones in Springs, ones in Pueblo.
[14:43.380 --> 14:46.100]  Uh, just ask them if they've got two docs on site.
[14:46.100 --> 14:48.620]  Should I just say the names, dude, I don't want to advertise, but it's helping people.
[14:48.620 --> 14:49.620]  Fuck it.
[14:49.620 --> 14:50.620]  I'm going to say, I'm going to say it just to help people.
[14:50.620 --> 14:51.620]  I don't care.
[14:51.620 --> 14:52.620]  These people aren't paying me.
[14:52.620 --> 14:54.540]  Uh, you can check out relaxed clarity and Pueblo.
[14:54.540 --> 14:59.460]  They may have two doctors on site and a place called Medieval in Colorado Springs often
[14:59.460 --> 15:01.000]  has two docs on site.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  I don't get paid for that.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  I just want to help you guys out.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.860]  If you need fucking, if trying to get a kid, a medical marijuana card, there's no reason
[15:05.860 --> 15:07.060]  to fucking hold anything back.
[15:07.060 --> 15:08.260]  I'll share that info.
[15:08.260 --> 15:11.620]  That's, that's worth the fucking one kid getting their card, right?
[15:11.620 --> 15:13.220]  One little kid not having a seizure.
[15:13.220 --> 15:14.220]  It's worth that shit.
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.220]  Free shout out to those places.
[15:15.220 --> 15:16.300]  Tom Ross to Jeff sent you.
[15:16.300 --> 15:18.300]  Maybe they'll fucking do something.
[15:18.300 --> 15:19.300]  If not, whatever.
[15:19.300 --> 15:23.900]  Uh, but getting your card is it's the process with the doc is just as hard.
[15:24.260 --> 15:25.260]  The extended plant counts are harder.
[15:25.260 --> 15:28.300]  If you're relying on going to the doc for an extended plant count and you don't have
[15:28.300 --> 15:32.440]  a bona fide relationship with your medical marijuana doctor, or you're not getting your
[15:32.440 --> 15:36.060]  medical marijuana card from your regular physician, which is always an option.
[15:36.060 --> 15:39.460]  If you have the balls to ask them and you don't want to lose your patient, a doctor
[15:39.460 --> 15:43.820]  relationship with some people, because some doctors will drop you just for admitting that
[15:43.820 --> 15:45.520]  you use cannabis or the idea.
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.560]  So make sure you have a good doc first.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.620]  But if you want an extended plant count, you need paperwork.
[15:50.620 --> 15:54.460]  You have to have some sort of proof that you've got some sort of condition that, uh,
[15:54.460 --> 15:58.780]  the use of medical cannabis would improve the quality of your life.
[15:58.780 --> 16:01.100]  That's got to fall on the list of qualifying conditions.
[16:01.100 --> 16:06.420]  Uh, so, but once you get that part done, getting it taken care of, like registering with the
[16:06.420 --> 16:10.440]  state and shit, if you know how to point and click on a Facebook page, you can register
[16:10.440 --> 16:11.540]  and get your card done.
[16:11.540 --> 16:12.540]  I'm thrilled.
[16:12.540 --> 16:13.740]  They've streamlined it.
[16:13.740 --> 16:14.740]  It takes a credit card.
[16:14.740 --> 16:20.220]  A couple of processes were, I mean, it was so painfully slow.
[16:20.820 --> 16:26.140]  I remember the first time I waited in line in the snow outside of a building in Denver.
[16:26.140 --> 16:29.260]  It took me about three hours to get there because I drove in the snow and then we waited
[16:29.260 --> 16:32.020]  outside of the building for about another three hours.
[16:32.020 --> 16:34.100]  Saw the doc for seriously seven seconds.
[16:34.100 --> 16:36.580]  He goes, what's your claim to fame was what he asked.
[16:36.580 --> 16:38.260]  He doesn't say what ails you, what hurts you.
[16:38.260 --> 16:39.980]  He goes, what's your claim to fame?
[16:39.980 --> 16:41.180]  And I said, man, my knees are fucked.
[16:41.180 --> 16:42.180]  And he goes, sit down.
[16:42.180 --> 16:45.940]  And he put a hand under my left thigh and he said, may I touch you?
[16:45.940 --> 16:46.940]  And I said, yeah, doc.
[16:46.940 --> 16:49.580]  And he put his hand under my left thigh and he goes, move your leg up.
[16:49.940 --> 16:51.700]  And I moved my leg up and he goes, oh, that's terrible.
[16:51.700 --> 16:52.700]  And he just went to writing.
[16:52.700 --> 16:55.260]  That was my first medical marijuana doctor experience.
[16:55.260 --> 16:57.180]  He was like, yes, is your money green?
[16:57.180 --> 16:58.180]  Yes, sir.
[16:58.180 --> 16:59.180]  My money's green.
[16:59.180 --> 17:00.180]  Oh, I will take your money.
[17:00.180 --> 17:01.180]  Here is your card.
[17:01.180 --> 17:04.580]  And he handed me my paperwork and he goes, the building right there at the green door
[17:04.580 --> 17:05.580]  is a dispensary.
[17:05.580 --> 17:07.460]  You get a 30% discount for shopping here today.
[17:07.460 --> 17:08.460]  Thank you.
[17:08.460 --> 17:09.460]  Have a great day.
[17:09.460 --> 17:10.460]  And just sent me out the fucking way.
[17:10.460 --> 17:13.780]  And then they give you a bundle of papers and you have to figure out which ones to mail,
[17:13.780 --> 17:16.340]  which ones to keep, which ones to post on your garden.
[17:16.780 --> 17:21.300]  Then you mail off shit and then you hope that this little certified mail thing comes back
[17:21.300 --> 17:23.100]  and then it would finally come back.
[17:23.100 --> 17:25.620]  It took for fucking ever for that thing to come back.
[17:25.620 --> 17:30.980]  It would come back and then like fucking six or eight weeks later, you'd get this crinkled
[17:30.980 --> 17:36.220]  up envelope from the state and you'd open it up and it would either say, oh, you wrote
[17:36.220 --> 17:38.300]  your middle initial a little weird.
[17:38.300 --> 17:41.260]  It doesn't look like an M. It looks like a crooked N. So you don't get your card.
[17:41.260 --> 17:45.300]  You have to fill out all this paperwork again, take it to another notary and then send it
[17:45.300 --> 17:46.300]  back and we'll try again.
[17:46.300 --> 17:49.420]  Or one that used to wreck people was used the wrong color ink.
[17:49.420 --> 17:50.420]  Yeah.
[17:50.420 --> 17:52.100]  You could only use black ink.
[17:52.100 --> 17:54.460]  You screw up some or your handshakes a little bit.
[17:54.460 --> 17:57.260]  So you just slap a line through it and finish whatever.
[17:57.260 --> 17:58.260]  Nope.
[17:58.260 --> 18:01.540]  You just voided that whole page or whole application shit.
[18:01.540 --> 18:04.940]  And then you've got to wait to three months for them to open it.
[18:04.940 --> 18:09.300]  The two months for them to process it, the week for it to get mailed back to you to know
[18:09.300 --> 18:11.180]  that, oh no, now you've got to start over.
[18:11.180 --> 18:12.180]  Yeah.
[18:12.180 --> 18:14.580]  Or you would get the card in the mail or your card shows up finally.
[18:14.860 --> 18:16.340]  And then those cards, the ink wore off of them.
[18:16.340 --> 18:18.100]  So a lot of people were just carrying around red cards.
[18:18.100 --> 18:20.540]  They're like, it doesn't even say my name, but I have a card.
[18:20.540 --> 18:22.300]  The first batch was fucking flimsy as hell.
[18:22.300 --> 18:24.380]  They used to be like $120 a pop.
[18:24.380 --> 18:25.820]  That was the original price.
[18:25.820 --> 18:30.340]  Now this, uh, the purple card that you got from the state for the past few years, it's
[18:30.340 --> 18:32.860]  purple and it's real thin and shitty plastic.
[18:32.860 --> 18:34.980]  And the numbers just wipe right off.
[18:34.980 --> 18:38.820]  If you get it warm and your hand is sweaty and you'll just take the numbers right off.
[18:38.820 --> 18:44.260]  I, uh, I've been to, uh, two different shops that give you a protective sleeve when you
[18:44.260 --> 18:48.740]  come in and yours is unprotected because they know it's going to be toast in weeks.
[18:48.740 --> 18:50.620]  And the numbers just stick to that.
[18:50.620 --> 18:55.340]  And good shops know that like if their customer's card dies, they can't let them in and out
[18:55.340 --> 18:56.340]  anymore.
[18:56.340 --> 18:57.340]  Right.
[18:57.340 --> 18:59.060]  And so, yeah, it's just protecting your ability to shop.
[18:59.060 --> 19:00.460]  They give you a free sleeve.
[19:00.460 --> 19:07.060]  I keep my medical marijuana card mostly to shop at three specific stores, like mostly
[19:07.180 --> 19:10.140]  one or two stores, but sometimes it's two or three.
[19:10.140 --> 19:14.220]  I like to be able to stop and shop anywhere I'm at in Colorado.
[19:14.220 --> 19:15.220]  And that helps a lot.
[19:15.220 --> 19:16.220]  It is completely helpful.
[19:16.220 --> 19:23.220]  And the legal protections it provides, I still really not rely on, but it's helpful.
[19:23.220 --> 19:26.900]  It's another, it's good for my mental health to have that in my back pocket.
[19:26.900 --> 19:30.540]  Old Doug gets really, uh, he gets, starts getting like antsy when his card expires.
[19:30.540 --> 19:32.100]  He's like, guy, we got to go get my card.
[19:32.100 --> 19:33.100]  I need my card renewed.
[19:33.100 --> 19:34.100]  And I'm like, bro, it's legal now.
[19:34.100 --> 19:35.340]  And he's like, I just feel better with it.
[19:35.340 --> 19:36.340]  I feel better.
[19:36.620 --> 19:37.620]  I get you Doug.
[19:37.620 --> 19:38.620]  We'll go get it for you, man.
[19:38.620 --> 19:39.620]  Let's do that.
[19:39.620 --> 19:44.980]  I mean, Doug's been around for a lot of that real crazy parts of the drug war that we were
[19:44.980 --> 19:46.260]  just kids during.
[19:46.260 --> 19:47.260]  He's amazed.
[19:47.260 --> 19:48.260]  We got to get Doug back on.
[19:48.260 --> 19:50.940]  He's amazed that, uh, he gets to see this.
[19:50.940 --> 19:54.180]  I don't know that he believed it would happen in his lifetime.
[19:54.180 --> 19:58.140]  That was the fun conversation I had all the time when I was working a sales counter at
[19:58.140 --> 20:03.340]  a dispensary was people that were my parents' age that were just blown away.
[20:03.340 --> 20:06.860]  Like the thing that we're talking about is teenagers finally really happened.
[20:06.860 --> 20:10.060]  Um, and they got to enjoy it before they died.
[20:10.060 --> 20:13.140]  These kids get to smoke weed and we didn't even get to do it.
[20:13.140 --> 20:16.380]  It's totally legal now who to thunk it.
[20:16.380 --> 20:17.380]  I knew it was coming.
[20:17.380 --> 20:18.380]  I saw it.
[20:18.380 --> 20:20.140]  All right, let's move forward a little bit.
[20:20.140 --> 20:22.420]  Mike, uh, we're trying to make a tight show already 20 minutes in.
[20:22.420 --> 20:24.220]  We haven't even gotten really to a topic.
[20:24.220 --> 20:25.220]  We love you guys.
[20:25.220 --> 20:30.220]  Uh, Ben, I feel bad for the recreational shoppers because the recreational dispensaries are kind
[20:30.220 --> 20:31.220]  of tourist traps.
[20:31.220 --> 20:32.220]  I've gone in there.
[20:32.220 --> 20:34.300]  They're set up completely different than medical shops.
[20:34.300 --> 20:35.420]  Their price points are different.
[20:35.420 --> 20:36.420]  It's all geared differently.
[20:36.420 --> 20:37.420]  Everything's geared different.
[20:37.420 --> 20:38.420]  It's getting totally different system.
[20:38.420 --> 20:39.420]  Yeah.
[20:39.420 --> 20:45.020]  If you're, if you're a Colorado resident, just go get that medical marijuana card and
[20:45.020 --> 20:46.020]  shop medically.
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.020]  It'll help you out.
[20:47.020 --> 20:48.020]  All right.
[20:48.020 --> 20:51.260]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend, big gear for the email that they sent me on
[20:51.260 --> 20:52.780]  the last podcast that I read.
[20:52.780 --> 20:55.260]  And also the followup that they sent to me.
[20:55.260 --> 20:56.500]  It's a really long email.
[20:56.500 --> 21:00.140]  It's more personal and to me more than it is to the listeners.
[21:00.140 --> 21:02.260]  So I kept it to myself.
[21:02.260 --> 21:06.380]  But man, this person, uh, you never know who you're talking to when you get an email from
[21:06.380 --> 21:09.340]  somebody and this person knows what the fuck they're talking about.
[21:09.340 --> 21:12.060]  When it comes to breeding, they have earned my respect.
[21:12.060 --> 21:16.820]  I cannot wait to grow some seeds that this person has bred because they have goals.
[21:16.820 --> 21:19.300]  They started a breeding project with the goal in mind.
[21:19.300 --> 21:21.540]  They reached the outcome they were looking for.
[21:21.540 --> 21:26.500]  Uh, the very smart person, well-spoken person, Gary, I'm proud to be friends with you.
[21:26.500 --> 21:27.500]  Thanks for reaching out to me.
[21:27.500 --> 21:28.500]  Thanks for the new email.
[21:28.500 --> 21:31.020]  I'm going to respond to you through email personally.
[21:31.020 --> 21:32.820]  I just wanted to give you a shout out here on the show.
[21:32.820 --> 21:36.060]  It is so nice when you run into people that are good at what they do.
[21:36.060 --> 21:37.220]  He's got pride and heart.
[21:37.220 --> 21:40.940]  He's the one that sent me the email about, uh, breeding that we're getting away from
[21:40.940 --> 21:42.340]  breeding like hardy plants.
[21:42.340 --> 21:44.940]  We're making a bunch of pussies to put in our grow rooms.
[21:44.940 --> 21:47.700]  Uh, the dude grows with heart, dude breeds with love.
[21:47.700 --> 21:49.300]  It's doing it all the way properly.
[21:49.300 --> 21:52.940]  Uh, much love and respect to that dude for the way he grows and breeds.
[21:52.940 --> 21:57.820]  Uh, also I owe a huge shout out to, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say your name.
[21:57.820 --> 22:00.900]  The reason I don't do that is because maybe your wife listens to the show and you're not
[22:00.900 --> 22:02.060]  supposed to be throwing money around.
[22:02.060 --> 22:03.060]  I don't know.
[22:03.060 --> 22:06.820]  I try to respect people's privacy, but somebody contributed to the Patreon account recently.
[22:06.820 --> 22:11.560]  And they also sent me an email and they said, Hey, I would rather send you a lump sum instead
[22:11.560 --> 22:14.100]  of just doing a monthly payment on Patreon.
[22:14.100 --> 22:18.900]  I don't have a method of doing that right now, but if that's what I got to do, I'm not
[22:18.900 --> 22:22.340]  going to deny myself of funding and I'm not going to leave money on the table.
[22:22.340 --> 22:26.860]  So I may create an account to make that an option because the people want to throw money
[22:26.900 --> 22:27.900]  at you.
[22:27.900 --> 22:28.900]  You find a way to catch it, right?
[22:28.900 --> 22:33.740]  Would it be possible to just set up a larger donation on Patreon, set it up for monthly
[22:33.740 --> 22:35.740]  and then just cancel it after one payment?
[22:35.740 --> 22:39.780]  You probably could, but if I just went in, like that seems kind of complicated.
[22:39.780 --> 22:43.740]  They mentioned that I should have a Venmo and they're not the first person to say that.
[22:43.740 --> 22:46.920]  So I should just go set up a Venmo account anyway, and then make a grow from your heart
[22:46.920 --> 22:49.060]  podcast Venmo page.
[22:49.060 --> 22:50.460]  And then people could help us out that way.
[22:50.460 --> 22:51.460]  Also dope, man.
[22:51.460 --> 22:54.740]  I should also do one of those Amazon links and affiliate link on Amazon.
[22:54.740 --> 22:55.740]  I'm busy.
[22:55.740 --> 23:01.340]  I'm sitting here smoking fucking lemon turps all day.
[23:01.340 --> 23:02.740]  You've already got it.
[23:02.740 --> 23:04.740]  How many social media accounts to manage?
[23:04.740 --> 23:05.740]  Right.
[23:05.740 --> 23:06.740]  And I have a full time job.
[23:06.740 --> 23:11.260]  Everybody, they don't all know that I run the semi large garden.
[23:11.260 --> 23:13.180]  That's a small garden for three rivers organics.
[23:13.180 --> 23:18.420]  I don't want to out you too much, but for a minute in the recent past, it was raining
[23:18.420 --> 23:20.180]  in the exact space where we record.
[23:20.180 --> 23:23.260]  No, I talked about on that pod, on the podcast, a lot on the show.
[23:24.020 --> 23:28.220]  This exact spot where the Mac book is sitting is where the puddle of water accumulated on
[23:28.220 --> 23:29.220]  this table.
[23:29.220 --> 23:34.060]  And yeah, so every time I get, when Mike leaves and we get done recording, the iPad will get
[23:34.060 --> 23:38.620]  peeled off the table and the Mac book will get taken to another area.
[23:38.620 --> 23:42.140]  All this gear gets put away to where it's in a waterproof safe place because I don't
[23:42.140 --> 23:44.340]  trust this roof right now until I get it fully repaired.
[23:44.340 --> 23:46.820]  It's patched and it's cool for a minute, but you got lucky.
[23:46.820 --> 23:51.400]  None of the gear got too toasted, but all this travel and rearranging and repacking
[23:51.400 --> 23:53.600]  and restoring is going to add to the wear and tear.
[23:53.600 --> 23:58.680]  It's been a bitch and I say peel the iPad off the table, you guys, because it's got
[23:58.680 --> 24:00.520]  so much hash stuck to the back of it.
[24:00.520 --> 24:01.840]  I was making fun of it for earlier.
[24:01.840 --> 24:03.840]  I could probably stick it to the wall and watch Netflix.
[24:03.840 --> 24:06.640]  I swear to God we could glue it to the wall right now with the loose hash.
[24:06.640 --> 24:07.640]  It's stuck to the back.
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.480]  There's too much glass around and it's an iPad, but watch, I want to try to move it
[24:11.480 --> 24:13.160]  off of the table and see if it makes a noise.
[24:13.160 --> 24:17.320]  I'm going to move the mic a little bit toward it.
[24:17.320 --> 24:19.160]  This is an iPad stuck to the table.
[24:19.160 --> 24:20.160]  Take one.
[24:21.160 --> 24:25.480]  I think you guys probably heard that.
[24:25.480 --> 24:28.960]  That was seriously sounded like that snap was coming through my headphones too.
[24:28.960 --> 24:31.720]  That was the hash sticking my iPad to the table.
[24:31.720 --> 24:33.760]  So yeah, that's my life.
[24:33.760 --> 24:35.560]  You guys, uh, where the heck are we?
[24:35.560 --> 24:39.320]  We're thanking Patreon contributors on possibly making a Venmo.
[24:39.320 --> 24:40.320]  I think that's where we were.
[24:40.320 --> 24:41.320]  We got sidetracked.
[24:41.320 --> 24:42.560]  Thank you to everyone that's contributed.
[24:42.560 --> 24:45.640]  It's so nice to have a clean microphone cover to spit on.
[24:45.640 --> 24:46.800]  You noticed that, huh?
[24:46.800 --> 24:47.800]  These are from China.
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.280]  They came from, uh, from Amazon and they smell like new shoes and weirdness.
[24:52.280 --> 24:56.920]  I remember like episode 12 where the first microphone covers were really starting to
[24:56.920 --> 24:58.520]  smell like a locker room.
[24:58.520 --> 25:02.400]  And I was so happy when we started rotating those out every now and again, but Patreon
[25:02.400 --> 25:06.160]  contributors, you're helping mount Mike's, uh, sanitary conditions over here.
[25:06.160 --> 25:07.360]  I've been talking about Patreon.
[25:07.360 --> 25:10.200]  I want to move on from it, but first I have to tell everybody how to do it.
[25:10.200 --> 25:12.620]  Just go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[25:12.620 --> 25:16.120]  If you'd like to sign up to contribute to the podcast, it's really easy.
[25:16.120 --> 25:17.560]  You type in your name, you type in some info.
[25:18.320 --> 25:19.320]  Of course you put in your credit card information.
[25:19.320 --> 25:20.840]  You type in the amount that you'd like to contribute.
[25:20.840 --> 25:22.720]  It is a monthly subscription service.
[25:22.720 --> 25:27.120]  So whatever amount you put in every month that will be, uh, contributed to the podcast.
[25:27.120 --> 25:29.280]  And it happens on the first of every month.
[25:29.280 --> 25:32.680]  So put in a dollar if you'd like put in however many you're comfortable with.
[25:32.680 --> 25:34.040]  I appreciate it.
[25:34.040 --> 25:35.960]  And if you cannot contribute, I still love you.
[25:35.960 --> 25:37.800]  And I still want you to listen to the show.
[25:37.800 --> 25:39.600]  There are people that can contribute.
[25:39.600 --> 25:40.600]  They're going to cover you.
[25:40.600 --> 25:43.800]  I want this podcast to be free for everybody.
[25:43.800 --> 25:47.200]  It's just an option to contribute if you want to, because I do put time and love into it.
[25:47.840 --> 25:51.440]  And it's a way for people to show some appreciation other than the cool ass fucking tweets, emails,
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.320]  Facebook messages, high fives on the streets, hugs at grow stores, uh, stuff like that.
[25:56.320 --> 25:57.320]  That all counts too.
[25:57.320 --> 25:58.320]  Trust me.
[25:58.320 --> 25:59.320]  I fucking love that.
[25:59.320 --> 26:02.600]  If you can't throw down on Patreon, like we a hundred percent understand if you want,
[26:02.600 --> 26:05.040]  you want to throw down in another way, there's a million ways to do it.
[26:05.040 --> 26:06.040]  Yeah.
[26:06.040 --> 26:08.200]  Just high five me when you see me and tell me, dude, great fucking podcast.
[26:08.200 --> 26:09.720]  That makes me smile all day.
[26:09.720 --> 26:12.560]  So I want to talk about growing cannabis for at least a couple of seconds here.
[26:12.560 --> 26:14.280]  This is a cannabis based podcast.
[26:14.360 --> 26:19.080]  I'm going to talk about something that I got into a conversation with some other people
[26:19.080 --> 26:21.640]  about, and then we will talk.
[26:21.640 --> 26:22.640]  Hopefully we'll read.
[26:22.640 --> 26:24.160]  This dude sent me three emails.
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.200]  I don't know if he thinks I'm really going to answer all three of them on one episode
[26:27.200 --> 26:28.960]  or if I'm going to stretch him out and tease him.
[26:28.960 --> 26:30.600]  I don't know what this dude expected.
[26:30.600 --> 26:31.600]  Send me three emails.
[26:31.600 --> 26:32.600]  Chris, what are you doing, bro?
[26:32.600 --> 26:33.600]  Come on.
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.360]  Anyway, I love it.
[26:37.360 --> 26:38.440]  Keep sending them folks.
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.720]  I was taking a quick step for Chris.
[26:39.720 --> 26:41.840]  Give us a second to respond to your first three.
[26:41.840 --> 26:42.840]  Chris slow down, bro.
[26:42.840 --> 26:43.840]  What the fuck?
[26:44.400 --> 26:46.920]  I'm not going to tell anybody, but Chris, keep you in the grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[26:46.920 --> 26:48.440]  Chris, I got you blocked.
[26:48.440 --> 26:49.440]  No, I'm just kidding.
[26:49.440 --> 26:51.720]  I'm just playing with you, man.
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.400]  Please send me more messages.
[26:53.400 --> 26:56.160]  So I want to talk about when you're transplanting.
[26:56.160 --> 27:01.920]  Let's say you're taking a clone from, uh, at the large grow where I work, we run clones
[27:01.920 --> 27:02.920]  in clone domes.
[27:02.920 --> 27:05.480]  We put rapid routers in a tray.
[27:05.480 --> 27:08.240]  We cut a clone into their dip it in.
[27:08.240 --> 27:09.360]  What's the purple shit?
[27:09.360 --> 27:11.720]  Clone X and stick it into the plug.
[27:11.720 --> 27:14.720]  And then we put the dome over it for like four days, five days and don't even fucking
[27:14.720 --> 27:15.720]  touch it.
[27:15.720 --> 27:18.680]  Um, then we water them lightly as needed.
[27:18.680 --> 27:21.360]  Then we start, I don't want to go over the whole clone thing.
[27:21.360 --> 27:22.360]  That wasn't the idea here.
[27:22.360 --> 27:23.960]  Uh, well then we get roots.
[27:23.960 --> 27:25.880]  Eventually we're going to fast forward to having roots.
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.280]  Fast forward to clones with roots.
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.560]  How much spaghetti are we talking here?
[27:30.560 --> 27:32.960]  Just enough to, uh, man, it works.
[27:32.960 --> 27:37.240]  I've transplanted clones in plugs with just one spaghetti coming out, one noodle, one
[27:37.240 --> 27:38.840]  white healthy noodle.
[27:38.840 --> 27:41.840]  If you got like four or five decent noodles coming out, you're ready to go.
[27:41.840 --> 27:45.120]  You can let them go a little longer if you want them to get like a little bit of hair
[27:45.120 --> 27:46.120]  on it.
[27:46.120 --> 27:47.880]  A little more than that personally, but not too much.
[27:47.880 --> 27:51.640]  I like to put them into a bigger pot and I like to, this is why I like to do it because
[27:51.640 --> 27:57.360]  at that point I will get some sort of root inoculant, a powder, maybe something like
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.200]  great white shark, something like as those there's cheap stuff.
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.760]  Uh, there are like store brand products that you can buy that are probably the same thing.
[28:05.760 --> 28:08.480]  Uh, there's mycos, there's plus life.
[28:08.720 --> 28:10.480]  If you're going to use plus life, go light.
[28:10.480 --> 28:11.480]  That shit's strong.
[28:11.480 --> 28:14.320]  Uh, from veg bloom, read your labels and know what you're using.
[28:14.320 --> 28:16.720]  There's forge, but I believe forge will be discontinued.
[28:16.720 --> 28:21.160]  We've got about 12 bags of forge left at the big grow and we're using them sparingly.
[28:21.160 --> 28:24.960]  But what I like to do with these powdered root inoculants, when you take your clones
[28:24.960 --> 28:29.260]  out of the clone dome and you're putting them into soil, so you get your pot and I like
[28:29.260 --> 28:33.300]  to use a six inch net pot or something, maybe a small one gallon pot to put my clones into
[28:33.300 --> 28:36.920]  so that you don't have to over water too much dirt for a small plant.
[28:36.920 --> 28:40.520]  Save yourself some space, save some water, let that fucker get rooted in there and get
[28:40.520 --> 28:43.200]  kind of, kind of tight in there before you up pot it.
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.400]  But anyway, before it goes in there, put in your dirt, uh, get it packed in semi tight,
[28:48.400 --> 28:50.480]  finger it a little bit to make a hole for the clone.
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.720]  And then I take that rooting powder and just sprinkle it all over the roots.
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.040]  Just rotate the clone a little bit in your hands and just sprinkle that powder.
[28:58.040 --> 28:59.040]  Nice dusting.
[28:59.040 --> 29:00.040]  Yeah.
[29:00.040 --> 29:01.040]  Just dust them real good.
[29:01.040 --> 29:02.960]  And then put that clone in there and cover it up just like normal.
[29:02.960 --> 29:06.520]  And then when you get them all done, water it like normal, like you would put some fulvic
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.240]  acid in there, maybe some kelp extract of some sort, a little bit of nitrogen.
[29:11.240 --> 29:14.160]  If you got any other, if you want to put some plus life or whatever you used back in the
[29:14.160 --> 29:16.320]  water and do it again, go for it.
[29:16.320 --> 29:19.960]  But I really think it's helpful to inoculate the roots at the beginning.
[29:19.960 --> 29:23.480]  Also when you're going to transplant from that small pot to a bigger pot, do it all
[29:23.480 --> 29:24.480]  over again.
[29:24.480 --> 29:26.240]  Fill your pot, put your fist in there.
[29:26.240 --> 29:28.680]  Same process, just a bigger, bigger piece of plant.
[29:28.680 --> 29:32.520]  Where you see those roots on the outside and don't transplant until you see roots on the
[29:32.520 --> 29:33.960]  outside of the smaller pot.
[29:33.960 --> 29:36.500]  When you see them gathering up out there, that's when it's time to go.
[29:36.500 --> 29:40.520]  You want it almost pushing to be like, Oh, it's been in there too long because that's
[29:40.520 --> 29:42.660]  when you put it in the next pot, it's going to explode.
[29:42.660 --> 29:44.180]  It's going to go, Oh, it's time.
[29:44.180 --> 29:45.180]  I'm blah.
[29:45.180 --> 29:46.340]  You just don't wait too long.
[29:46.340 --> 29:47.340]  Right.
[29:47.340 --> 29:51.540]  Cause you'll piss it off if you wait too long, but right when it gets tight, take it out
[29:51.540 --> 29:55.500]  and just turn it in a circle and just sprinkle a root powder, whatever you're using.
[29:55.500 --> 29:58.760]  As those micros great white shark plus life forge.
[29:58.760 --> 29:59.760]  There's a ton of them.
[29:59.760 --> 30:02.600]  You guys, I bet there's a ton that I don't even fucking know about.
[30:02.600 --> 30:06.620]  Just sprinkle it right on there and then pot it just like normal and then feed it with
[30:06.620 --> 30:07.620]  healthy nutrients.
[30:07.620 --> 30:11.320]  Put it under a good light, put a fan on it, let it get some airflow, get it healthy.
[30:11.320 --> 30:15.440]  I think a little dusting of the roots would really improve your growth.
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.920]  That's one small affordable way.
[30:16.920 --> 30:18.800]  Just got to go by and wear a mask.
[30:18.800 --> 30:19.800]  You guys just get one.
[30:19.800 --> 30:23.920]  If nothing else, get one of those cheap, uh, the planter masks, the fucking Asian bird
[30:23.920 --> 30:25.760]  flu mask, uh, dust the roots.
[30:25.760 --> 30:28.960]  It's fucking good for your roots and good for your plants and they will appreciate it
[30:28.960 --> 30:34.880]  and then feed them stuff like plus life throughout their veg phase and their early flower phase.
[30:34.880 --> 30:35.880]  Happy roots will help you out.
[30:35.880 --> 30:36.880]  All right.
[30:36.880 --> 30:37.880]  Roots is the key to have.
[30:37.880 --> 30:39.680]  So, um, we teased Chris's email.
[30:39.680 --> 30:40.680]  We're 30 minutes in.
[30:40.680 --> 30:45.720]  Let's give him at least one email and then, uh, we'll see how much time we've got.
[30:45.720 --> 30:49.580]  Maybe we'll read his other two or we'll, maybe we'll just save time for other listeners to
[30:49.580 --> 30:51.240]  get emails in the show.
[30:51.240 --> 30:55.200]  All right, Chris, I'm going to pick on you till the end of time.
[30:55.200 --> 30:58.840]  All right, Chris, we got to say, Chris sent me an email and it goes like this.
[30:59.220 --> 31:01.520]  Oh, I don't know if we should have been saying his fucking name the whole time because that's
[31:01.520 --> 31:03.520]  not what he signed it as Diablo.
[31:03.520 --> 31:05.000]  Maybe I'll just go put a bleep over it.
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.520]  I'm going to have to do something.
[31:06.520 --> 31:09.120]  37 bleeps now because we said his name a bunch.
[31:09.120 --> 31:10.120]  That's cool.
[31:10.120 --> 31:11.120]  30 minutes in.
[31:11.120 --> 31:12.120]  I can edit the shit out of this.
[31:12.120 --> 31:13.120]  Sorry, dude.
[31:13.120 --> 31:14.720]  Just everybody be cool with it.
[31:14.720 --> 31:16.720]  Yeah, it's not the name I said.
[31:16.720 --> 31:18.680]  I was saying his fake name the whole time.
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.920]  Uh, the email goes like this.
[31:19.920 --> 31:22.800]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, I'm hitting you with a few questions in a row tonight.
[31:22.800 --> 31:26.360]  I was hoping you could talk about your methods for taking down a plant to keep those turps
[31:26.360 --> 31:27.360]  loud.
[31:27.360 --> 31:30.640]  Do you go dark cycle, pre-chop, dry trim or wet trim?
[31:30.640 --> 31:32.720]  We would love to hear how you do it.
[31:32.720 --> 31:33.720]  Big fan of the show.
[31:33.720 --> 31:35.520]  I've been a listener for about a year and a half now.
[31:35.520 --> 31:42.560]  You definitely make my mind numbing 50 plus hour work week, uh, plus hour a week day job.
[31:42.560 --> 31:43.560]  A lot better.
[31:43.560 --> 31:44.560]  Sorry, that was hard to read.
[31:44.560 --> 31:48.480]  A big thanks for putting out a quality podcast and helping people learn something and have
[31:48.480 --> 31:49.960]  a laugh while listening.
[31:49.960 --> 31:52.240]  Uh, much thanks sincerely.
[31:52.240 --> 31:58.320]  So his question was, can we give him any tips on keeping the turps loud at harvest
[31:58.320 --> 31:59.320]  time?
[31:59.320 --> 32:01.200]  Let me start by saying most definitely can.
[32:01.200 --> 32:03.280]  Yes, I've got tips all day.
[32:03.280 --> 32:09.400]  Uh, the first tip, uh, is a little advice that light destroys turpenoids quickly.
[32:09.400 --> 32:11.600]  So dark is always good for your turps.
[32:11.600 --> 32:13.120]  Keep the lights a little bit away.
[32:13.120 --> 32:15.320]  I loved that part of the question.
[32:15.320 --> 32:16.320]  Yes.
[32:16.320 --> 32:23.200]  So the question was, do you do a light, a dark cycle, um, before you harvest?
[32:23.200 --> 32:24.200]  So yes.
[32:24.200 --> 32:27.560]  Uh, if you're going just for loud turps, yes, that will help you out.
[32:27.560 --> 32:30.280]  It will also, in my opinion, add to density.
[32:30.280 --> 32:32.680]  Uh, don't put them in the dark cycle when they're super wet.
[32:32.680 --> 32:36.800]  If you're going to put them in the dark, let them get not dry, but don't put them in there
[32:36.800 --> 32:41.520]  when they're soggy because dark and soggy is never a good thing that will could lead
[32:41.520 --> 32:42.520]  to problems.
[32:42.520 --> 32:45.200]  I'll let them get a little bit dry before you put them in the dark.
[32:45.720 --> 32:46.220]  Yes.
[32:46.220 --> 32:47.220]  Light does.
[32:47.220 --> 32:48.800]  Like I said, light does kind of kill the turps.
[32:48.800 --> 32:50.600]  So they are producing more turps.
[32:50.600 --> 32:51.840]  The turps are getting louder.
[32:51.840 --> 32:53.760]  Like you asked, they're getting richer and stronger.
[32:53.760 --> 32:55.600]  They're developing more in the dark phase.
[32:55.600 --> 33:00.320]  So if you do cut them down in a dark phase, there will be more terpenes present in your
[33:00.320 --> 33:03.640]  trichomes in your plants, in your flowers, in your concentrates.
[33:03.640 --> 33:05.560]  Uh, so a dark phase is always good.
[33:05.560 --> 33:07.600]  I like to get it a little bit cold toward the end.
[33:07.600 --> 33:09.280]  That makes them dense up a little bit.
[33:09.280 --> 33:10.280]  Also make some purple.
[33:10.280 --> 33:11.600]  I think it kind of makes them panic.
[33:11.600 --> 33:13.120]  Uh, make sure you flush.
[33:13.160 --> 33:15.920]  I think you say something about that in another email.
[33:15.920 --> 33:19.480]  So also the less you touch those plants, the better.
[33:19.480 --> 33:20.920]  Uh, cut them down.
[33:20.920 --> 33:22.600]  You ask wet or dry trim.
[33:22.600 --> 33:23.960]  I prefer a dry trim.
[33:23.960 --> 33:26.960]  Cut them down, hang them upside down, touch them very little.
[33:26.960 --> 33:27.960]  Okay.
[33:27.960 --> 33:29.440]  Let me back up a step.
[33:29.440 --> 33:31.280]  Flush cut off all the family.
[33:31.280 --> 33:32.800]  Flush is so important.
[33:32.800 --> 33:34.000]  He's got another email about that.
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.600]  So we're just going to do that one next.
[33:35.600 --> 33:39.920]  The flush cut off all the families when they start getting close to the harvest time, then
[33:39.920 --> 33:42.560]  put them in the dark without those big families on there.
[33:42.560 --> 33:47.920]  Uh, then let them sit for humidity to let them sit for 24 to 48 hours in the dark, cut
[33:47.920 --> 33:51.960]  them down, hang them upside down until the stems begin to pop.
[33:51.960 --> 33:55.520]  And from there you have to listen to the drying cure episodes because now you're drying and
[33:55.520 --> 33:59.200]  curing more than harvesting, but that's where you get it.
[33:59.200 --> 34:00.200]  That's where it starts.
[34:00.200 --> 34:02.160]  Then you have to let it dry until the sticks pop.
[34:02.160 --> 34:07.120]  Then you cut the buds off of the sticks into a container and seal that container and burp
[34:07.120 --> 34:10.120]  it appropriately until the moisture is gone.
[34:10.120 --> 34:15.000]  I like to make it go really slowly if possible in Colorado, weed dries really quickly.
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.400]  It's hard to go slow here.
[34:16.400 --> 34:19.200]  You're trying to get chlorophyll out and keep turpenoids in.
[34:19.200 --> 34:22.920]  So you want to keep the right temperatures and you want to keep light away from it.
[34:22.920 --> 34:26.200]  Try to keep it semi cool, uh, around 72 degrees.
[34:26.200 --> 34:28.760]  74 degrees is probably right around where you want it.
[34:28.760 --> 34:30.980]  Maybe 77 don't go too high.
[34:30.980 --> 34:33.000]  Heat destroys, turps light, destroys turps.
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.520]  So dry and cure it properly.
[34:34.520 --> 34:35.520]  Handle it properly.
[34:35.520 --> 34:36.640]  Don't touch it.
[34:36.640 --> 34:38.440]  It will start causing problems.
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.180]  If you can keep it in glass containers, that's recommended.
[34:42.180 --> 34:44.640]  What else can we recommend you dry trimming?
[34:44.640 --> 34:46.400]  Never use a trim machine.
[34:46.400 --> 34:47.880]  I'm going to get off on a side rant.
[34:47.880 --> 34:49.200]  I fucking hate trim machines.
[34:49.200 --> 34:50.880]  The cannabis industry hates trim machines.
[34:50.880 --> 34:55.920]  The only people that like trim machines are greedy growers and grow a facility owners
[34:55.920 --> 34:57.600]  that want to make a lot of money.
[34:57.600 --> 34:58.800]  Trim machines, mango buds.
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.320]  In my opinion, this is all my opinion.
[35:00.320 --> 35:05.360]  I could be fucking wrong, but I've yet to see one that does what it's supposed to without
[35:05.360 --> 35:08.080]  a serious detriment to the final product.
[35:08.080 --> 35:11.040]  And another thing that a trim machine will never do.
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.600]  I had a trimmer today find issues in buds.
[35:13.600 --> 35:16.920]  If those buds got pulled aside, they will never make it to the public.
[35:16.920 --> 35:21.440]  That whole plant got re-inspected because there was one small issue in one small area.
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.080]  That part got segregated and counted as waste and destroyed.
[35:25.080 --> 35:26.520]  The rest of the plant was okay.
[35:26.520 --> 35:27.800]  I deemed I would smoke it.
[35:27.800 --> 35:29.140]  I would smoke that myself.
[35:29.140 --> 35:32.120]  So it got passed on and trimmed and taken care of.
[35:32.120 --> 35:35.320]  A machine would have never seen that and that shit would have rolled down the line and got
[35:35.320 --> 35:38.680]  put into either our hash or our pipe or a jar to get sold.
[35:38.680 --> 35:39.960]  And it would have embarrassed us.
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.200]  You cannot put a value on that quality control that a good, well-trained, educated trimmer
[35:45.200 --> 35:46.200]  brings to the table.
[35:46.200 --> 35:52.640]  I mean, when you say don't touch it, I've been trimming with people and you look over
[35:52.640 --> 35:55.000]  and their glove is just solid.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  Right.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.720]  That means you're manhandling the fuck out of my buds.
[35:58.720 --> 36:01.000]  Half of what I grew is now on your glove.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  Yeah.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  There's a stick on there.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Just handle that stick.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  Yep.
[36:05.680 --> 36:08.480]  I'm going to have a stick to handle and don't manhandle the buds.
[36:08.480 --> 36:11.160]  I think we kind of answered that.
[36:11.160 --> 36:14.920]  I would recommend you listening to the drying and curing episode also, but for the most
[36:14.920 --> 36:17.960]  part, that's where the harvest turps come in.
[36:17.960 --> 36:19.680]  You cut it down in the dark.
[36:19.680 --> 36:23.200]  You keep it dark, cut it down, keep it in the dark, dry it really slowly.
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.160]  When the sticks pop, then you cut the buds off the sticks, put them into a glass container
[36:27.160 --> 36:28.160]  and burp them.
[36:28.160 --> 36:29.160]  I've got OCD.
[36:29.160 --> 36:33.760]  I like to burp it at four hours, tumble them around a little bit, get air in there because
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.760]  they're going to be a little damp.
[36:35.520 --> 36:38.400]  You might want to pull them apart, put them back in the jar, close it up, burp them at
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.560]  eight hours, do it again at 16 and start doing it like every 12 hour, do it eight, four,
[36:43.560 --> 36:44.560]  eight and then 12.
[36:44.560 --> 36:47.960]  Start doing every 12 hours before when you wake up, before you go to bed every day, burp
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.040]  these buds, give them 15, 20, maybe 30 minutes open.
[36:52.040 --> 36:53.680]  You're not trying to dry them.
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.520]  You're trying to let moisture escape the bud.
[36:58.520 --> 37:01.320]  When you close that jar, a reaction happens.
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.720]  There's oxygen and moisture and darkness and those create the perfect environment for
[37:06.720 --> 37:09.440]  the chlorophyll to start breaking down.
[37:09.440 --> 37:10.480]  You create an acid in there.
[37:10.480 --> 37:12.040]  Is it aerobic or anaerobic acid?
[37:12.040 --> 37:13.040]  It's with oxygen.
[37:13.040 --> 37:14.040]  I'm pretty sure it's anaerobic.
[37:14.040 --> 37:15.720]  Okay, so you treat the anaerobic acid in there.
[37:15.720 --> 37:17.520]  That starts eating out the chlorophyll.
[37:17.520 --> 37:18.920]  I believe you're correct.
[37:18.920 --> 37:21.520]  It starts eating out the chlorophyll and it turns it into a vapor.
[37:21.520 --> 37:26.200]  When you open the jar, the moisture allows that to escape is how I think it goes.
[37:26.200 --> 37:28.680]  I'm just reciting off the top of my head with no notes.
[37:28.680 --> 37:29.680]  That sounds right.
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.800]  You have to have a little moisture in there to dry slowly to pull out that chlorophyll.
[37:33.800 --> 37:36.280]  Chlorophyll is what gives you the rough, harsh taste.
[37:36.280 --> 37:38.440]  Terps are what give you that sweet, delicious taste.
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.280]  That burnt green flavor.
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.200]  That's why rosin always tastes like burnt popcorn if you overheat it and press it too
[37:45.200 --> 37:46.200]  hard.
[37:46.200 --> 37:48.960]  You're just burning the terps right there.
[37:48.960 --> 37:49.960]  There's more to this email.
[37:49.960 --> 37:50.960]  I'm opening up my phone because it locked.
[37:50.960 --> 37:51.960]  Here we go.
[37:51.960 --> 37:57.040]  He goes on to say, my phone is making noise into the mixing equipment.
[37:57.040 --> 37:58.040]  I am sorry.
[37:58.040 --> 37:59.400]  Haha, big fan of the show.
[38:00.120 --> 38:01.120]  I've been a listener for about a year and a half.
[38:01.120 --> 38:02.120]  Dude, thank you.
[38:02.120 --> 38:06.120]  I make his mind numbing 50 plus hour a week day job a lot better.
[38:06.120 --> 38:07.120]  That's right.
[38:07.120 --> 38:10.120]  Dude, what do you do that you're able to listen to that many podcasts all week and what else
[38:10.120 --> 38:11.120]  are you listening to?
[38:11.120 --> 38:15.320]  Send that in your next email and I'll unblock you.
[38:15.320 --> 38:20.040]  Thanks for putting out a quality podcast and helping people learn and have a laugh while
[38:20.040 --> 38:21.040]  listening.
[38:21.040 --> 38:24.480]  Fucking nailing it if that's what I'm doing because I like to laugh.
[38:24.480 --> 38:25.480]  That's the mission statement.
[38:25.480 --> 38:27.200]  I'm a filthy comedian inside.
[38:27.200 --> 38:29.960]  I try to keep it at bay on the show and I love to grow cannabis.
[38:29.960 --> 38:31.440]  So I'm glad that you noticed that.
[38:31.440 --> 38:32.840]  Dude, thank you for the email.
[38:32.840 --> 38:34.680]  I'm going to email you right now.
[38:34.680 --> 38:36.040]  Mike, you talk for a minute.
[38:36.040 --> 38:37.960]  Well, we're waiting for a response.
[38:37.960 --> 38:38.960]  Oh, I don't.
[38:38.960 --> 38:40.320]  We don't need to wait for a response right now.
[38:40.320 --> 38:41.320]  We got days.
[38:41.320 --> 38:42.680]  I was just something to say.
[38:42.680 --> 38:43.680]  Good segue.
[38:43.680 --> 38:44.680]  I killed it.
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.040]  I wanted to say thank you to all the people that sent me messages after the last show
[38:48.040 --> 38:51.480]  where we got super big before we hit record.
[38:51.480 --> 38:52.880]  I appreciate the feedback.
[38:52.880 --> 38:53.880]  That's always nice.
[38:53.880 --> 38:54.880]  Thank you, everybody.
[38:54.880 --> 38:57.440]  As baked as we got, people really enjoyed it.
[38:57.440 --> 39:02.840]  It's got so much feedback today when we were like, let's not get so baked into a tighter
[39:02.840 --> 39:03.840]  show.
[39:03.840 --> 39:06.920]  But my first thought was like, but everybody loved our super baked show.
[39:06.920 --> 39:11.640]  There's one point in the show when I think I purposefully paused to edit.
[39:11.640 --> 39:13.880]  And when I listened to back, I didn't even edit.
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.360]  I was like, right here, I need to edit the show is why I paused at one point.
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.240]  I was like, and here we go with the podcast.
[39:20.240 --> 39:21.800]  And I didn't edit that at all.
[39:21.800 --> 39:25.480]  I was listening back and my friend Elijah's like, I don't think you did that right.
[39:25.480 --> 39:27.560]  And I was like, oops, we recorded it.
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.600]  It like we meant to hit record at like 930.
[39:30.600 --> 39:34.480]  We didn't actually end up recording until at well after 10.
[39:34.480 --> 39:38.780]  The video was or the podcast was posted at midnight.
[39:38.780 --> 39:42.640]  And by 4am I was getting tweets and messages about how good the show was.
[39:42.640 --> 39:43.640]  Nice.
[39:43.640 --> 39:45.000]  It was a quick turnaround on that one.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.600]  That's fun when you post it and people listen as it goes up.
[39:47.600 --> 39:48.600]  Yep.
[39:48.600 --> 39:49.600]  When the alert comes up on your phone.
[39:49.600 --> 39:51.760]  We've got an awesome little community you've built.
[39:52.720 --> 39:53.720]  All right.
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.240]  Do we want to read the next one from the message goes like this.
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.640]  I'm going to read to because I said his fucking full name on the show and we may have to edit
[40:00.640 --> 40:02.120]  a few minutes out anyway.
[40:02.120 --> 40:03.120]  So it goes like this.
[40:03.120 --> 40:04.120]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.380]  I had a question about flushing in cocoa.
[40:06.380 --> 40:07.380]  Do it.
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.380]  That's my advice.
[40:08.380 --> 40:13.320]  Do you do just plain water plus a flushing additive or do you water with a small amount
[40:13.320 --> 40:15.440]  of cow mag added in because of your cocoa?
[40:15.440 --> 40:17.740]  I heard that was given as advice.
[40:17.740 --> 40:22.700]  So wanted to hear your thoughts on behind unpaid water flush or pH in your flush in
[40:22.700 --> 40:26.540]  cocoa as well as soil like a pro mix.
[40:26.540 --> 40:27.540]  All right.
[40:27.540 --> 40:29.940]  There's a couple of things to touch on there.
[40:29.940 --> 40:30.940]  Flushing in cocoa.
[40:30.940 --> 40:32.500]  Do you add just before I go that far?
[40:32.500 --> 40:35.500]  I want to ask and I want to address this.
[40:35.500 --> 40:38.620]  Are you flushing just at the end of flower?
[40:38.620 --> 40:44.300]  Because some people think that they need to flush their cocoa during the flowering cycle,
[40:44.300 --> 40:47.700]  which I find unnecessary when I'm watering with cocoa and I'm growing with cocoa.
[40:47.940 --> 40:52.220]  I add nutrients to every single watering when I'm growing with cocoa.
[40:52.220 --> 40:56.180]  Some people feel the need at the end of week three to just run so much clean water through
[40:56.180 --> 40:57.300]  it and flush out the nutrients.
[40:57.300 --> 40:58.940]  I don't feel the need to do that.
[40:58.940 --> 41:00.500]  I like to have it in there.
[41:00.500 --> 41:05.300]  Cocoa has a low, I don't want to say this wrong because I'm full of shit.
[41:05.300 --> 41:07.220]  There's a low cation exchange.
[41:07.220 --> 41:09.340]  Shit doesn't bind to cocoa.
[41:09.340 --> 41:10.340]  Stuff doesn't stick.
[41:10.340 --> 41:15.060]  I was thinking for the slightly more scientific term for it doesn't hold the nutrients as
[41:15.060 --> 41:16.060]  well as dirt.
[41:16.060 --> 41:17.060]  Right.
[41:17.420 --> 41:20.060]  It doesn't live like the dirt does.
[41:20.060 --> 41:25.060]  It's real slick and it's oily and the nutrients and the salts will slide right off of it essentially.
[41:25.060 --> 41:28.860]  It's more like a sponge that will hold stuff that things can fall out of.
[41:28.860 --> 41:29.860]  And that's the idea.
[41:29.860 --> 41:32.600]  So we're more able to feed more consistently.
[41:32.600 --> 41:37.660]  So when I'm talking about flushing, I am only talking about the final phase of flowering
[41:37.660 --> 41:40.260]  when you were trying to get the nutrients out just before harvest.
[41:40.260 --> 41:42.740]  Right at the end there.
[41:42.740 --> 41:50.300]  In soil or cocoa, I don't recommend a mid-cycle flush of any type unless you're seeing a problem.
[41:50.300 --> 41:56.460]  And then if I do that, I mix up a very specific batch of nutrients that I use and I flush
[41:56.460 --> 41:59.540]  every plant heavily with that until water's running out.
[41:59.540 --> 42:03.660]  And then I know that most of the old nutrients are out and what's in there now is this mix
[42:03.660 --> 42:07.200]  that I trust and I know that's going to make my plants happy.
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.340]  That's what I put in there to fix a problem.
[42:09.340 --> 42:13.580]  So now when I'm talking about flushing, I'm going to go to just the end of flowering right
[42:13.580 --> 42:14.580]  now is what I'm talking about.
[42:14.580 --> 42:15.940]  Mike, you look like you want to jump in.
[42:15.940 --> 42:23.100]  I was going to ask, do you recommend just watering the normal volume of water with clean
[42:23.100 --> 42:24.620]  or clean pH water?
[42:24.620 --> 42:25.620]  Or do you like to...
[42:25.620 --> 42:31.060]  I think of it as flooding the plant where like, say you're going to start flush today,
[42:31.060 --> 42:38.440]  the plant gets six or eight or 10 times its normal volume of water to kind of just force
[42:38.540 --> 42:40.460]  everything out.
[42:40.460 --> 42:44.980]  It would be ideal to know exactly how much you can put through and what it takes, but
[42:44.980 --> 42:48.920]  there are several ways to do it depending on your environment and your situation and
[42:48.920 --> 42:51.380]  your timeframe.
[42:51.380 --> 42:55.860]  Let me write down something with my pen here, which is funny because I'm writing down the
[42:55.860 --> 42:57.540]  word pen.
[42:57.540 --> 43:00.380]  Let me write a note to kind of get back to what you're asking, but then I want to kind
[43:00.380 --> 43:03.980]  of read the email because you've got a side question that's going to kind of put me onto
[43:03.980 --> 43:04.980]  that.
[43:04.980 --> 43:05.980]  Yeah.
[43:05.980 --> 43:09.260]  Do you flush with just plain water or a flushing additive?
[43:09.260 --> 43:11.880]  You can do a flushing additive if you want.
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.360]  If you want to speed up the process, if you only have seven days to flush, put a flushing
[43:16.360 --> 43:17.720]  additive in there in the first day.
[43:17.720 --> 43:20.960]  If you've got 10 days of flush, consider the flushing additive.
[43:20.960 --> 43:23.920]  If you've got 12 to 14 days, it's not necessary.
[43:23.920 --> 43:26.120]  What a flushing additive does, it sugars.
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.700]  When you add the sugars to the water and pour it through your grow medium, sugars will help
[43:30.700 --> 43:35.040]  release bonded salts is basically what happens.
[43:35.100 --> 43:38.820]  It's not a hundred percent what goes on there, but the sugars will help release bonded salts
[43:38.820 --> 43:42.620]  in your rhizosphere, which will help flush your plants and help speed up the metabolism
[43:42.620 --> 43:43.620]  of your plants.
[43:43.620 --> 43:45.100]  That's the part why you would use that.
[43:45.100 --> 43:48.140]  It's not necessary, but it's helpful.
[43:48.140 --> 43:51.780]  If you've got it, go for it.
[43:51.780 --> 43:52.780]  Just plain water works.
[43:52.780 --> 43:57.740]  Then you say, would you water with a small amount of CalMag added in because of the cocoa?
[43:57.740 --> 43:58.740]  No.
[43:58.740 --> 44:02.900]  If I'm flushing, this is why I wasn't sure if you meant flushing at the end or like at
[44:02.920 --> 44:05.440]  the end of week three and five or something like that.
[44:05.440 --> 44:07.000]  No, if I'm flushing, I'm flushing.
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.000]  I want it gone.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.280]  I don't want anything in there.
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.520]  Unless I'm using VegBloom, I will go until the last five or seven days with some Shine,
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.860]  but I never said that out loud.
[44:16.860 --> 44:21.680]  Check out VegBloom tech on Instagram for all the details on how to use Shine properly because
[44:21.680 --> 44:22.680]  it's a great product.
[44:22.680 --> 44:26.360]  They don't pay me to say that, but it helps.
[44:26.360 --> 44:27.720]  Don't put anything in there at the end of flush.
[44:27.720 --> 44:28.720]  I'm flushing.
[44:28.720 --> 44:29.720]  I want it all to go bye-bye.
[44:29.720 --> 44:37.020]  Also, I want to hear your thoughts behind un-pH or pH water during your flush.
[44:37.020 --> 44:41.020]  If you can pH it, if you've got the ability, why not do it?
[44:41.020 --> 44:45.660]  If you are flushing an outdoor plant that you've got a hundred gallon fucking smart
[44:45.660 --> 44:48.360]  pot outside, just put the hose on there and let it run, dude.
[44:48.360 --> 44:50.320]  Don't even try to pH that shit.
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.320]  It's going to take so much pH down.
[44:52.320 --> 44:54.120]  You may not have a reservoir to do it.
[44:54.120 --> 44:55.120]  It's outside.
[44:55.120 --> 44:56.340]  You'll be okay.
[44:56.340 --> 44:57.720]  You don't have to pH.
[44:57.720 --> 44:58.720]  They're done.
[44:58.720 --> 45:02.700]  Nothing too bad is going to happen, but if you can pH it, do it.
[45:02.700 --> 45:03.700]  Why not?
[45:03.700 --> 45:06.900]  In some places, that's going to be crazy important depending on your water.
[45:06.900 --> 45:07.900]  That is true.
[45:07.900 --> 45:10.960]  If your water is completely fucking funky, you are going to need to pH it.
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.260]  If you've got ... We're very lucky here.
[45:13.260 --> 45:14.740]  Our water kind of tastes like shit.
[45:14.740 --> 45:17.780]  It's got a weird flavor, but if you test it, it's really not that bad.
[45:17.780 --> 45:19.460]  The PPMs are low.
[45:19.460 --> 45:20.980]  The pH is all right.
[45:20.980 --> 45:22.380]  It's really not that bad.
[45:22.380 --> 45:23.780]  You can flush with water from here.
[45:23.780 --> 45:27.420]  I don't know where you are, a guy whose name I keep fucking up and shouldn't say that I
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.480]  will set again.
[45:28.480 --> 45:33.200]  I don't know if you can ... If you've got well water, I don't know what you're using.
[45:33.200 --> 45:35.560]  You might want to pH that.
[45:35.560 --> 45:38.420]  Let me recap and make sure I got all your stuff before I go on to the part that Mike
[45:38.420 --> 45:40.720]  made me write down with my brain.
[45:40.720 --> 45:44.360]  Plain water, flushing additive if you're in a hurry, but make sure if you use that flushing
[45:44.360 --> 45:49.900]  additive, make sure you get at least one clean water rinse after that so that your flushing
[45:49.900 --> 45:51.800]  additive isn't what you taste.
[45:51.800 --> 45:54.320]  No, I don't use CalMag in my flush.
[45:54.320 --> 45:59.140]  The only thing I would consider using during my flush would probably be Shine from our
[45:59.140 --> 46:03.820]  friends at Vegbloom, also known as Hydroponic Research.
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.280]  pH it if you can.
[46:05.280 --> 46:06.520]  It's not necessary.
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.300]  Also wanted to know ... It may not be necessary.
[46:09.300 --> 46:10.620]  Sorry, I don't want to mislead you.
[46:10.620 --> 46:11.620]  It's not necessary for me.
[46:11.620 --> 46:17.700]  I wanted to know my thoughts behind un-pH water and flush in soil as well.
[46:17.700 --> 46:18.700]  Soil is much more forgiving.
[46:18.700 --> 46:22.700]  If you've got decent water, you're going to want to run a lot more water through your
[46:22.700 --> 46:25.360]  soil than your cocoa to flush that out.
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.420]  It's going to be a lot harder to get everything out in the soil than it will to cocoa.
[46:30.420 --> 46:34.240]  It depends on how much you're using, honestly, if you want to pH it or not.
[46:34.240 --> 46:38.740]  If you've got a big outdoor fucking grow, you might just want to run the hose.
[46:38.740 --> 46:40.440]  So I wrote down something here.
[46:40.440 --> 46:46.680]  Flushing, either in cocoa or soilless mix or however you want to grow, one thing you
[46:46.680 --> 46:51.340]  can do, elevate your pot off of the ground.
[46:51.340 --> 46:53.500]  You can use a tray under it.
[46:53.500 --> 46:54.500]  This would work too.
[46:54.500 --> 46:56.140]  Put a tray under it, just a little saucer.
[46:56.140 --> 46:58.040]  Catch the water that's coming out of it is my point.
[46:58.040 --> 46:59.220]  Clean your vessel.
[46:59.220 --> 47:02.740]  Set the pot on a vessel of some sort that is going to catch the water.
[47:02.740 --> 47:06.840]  You need a half inch of water, maybe an inch of water coming out of the bottom of your
[47:06.840 --> 47:07.840]  pot.
[47:07.840 --> 47:10.660]  Flush it, flush it, flush it until it's draining a lot, until you see a bunch of water coming
[47:10.660 --> 47:11.660]  out.
[47:11.660 --> 47:12.660]  Go hard.
[47:12.660 --> 47:15.380]  Then catch some of that water and stick an EC pin in there.
[47:15.380 --> 47:19.260]  Stick a PPM pin in there and see how much shit's coming out of the bottom of your plant.
[47:19.260 --> 47:20.660]  See how low you can get it.
[47:20.660 --> 47:23.780]  If you're in cocoa, you can get it really low.
[47:23.780 --> 47:26.780]  Soil it's going to stay up kind of higher just because there's stuff in the soil.
[47:26.780 --> 47:29.060]  You've got natural stuff in your soil.
[47:29.060 --> 47:32.300]  You're not getting it all out until you rinse out all the soil.
[47:32.300 --> 47:35.300]  See how low you can get it in that cocoa.
[47:35.300 --> 47:39.620]  You should be able to get it fairly low.
[47:39.620 --> 47:41.100]  Maybe test the cocoa when you get it.
[47:41.100 --> 47:42.140]  Run some water through it.
[47:42.140 --> 47:44.660]  See what it ECs at before you put nutrients in it.
[47:44.660 --> 47:46.300]  Try to get it back to there before you flush.
[47:46.300 --> 47:47.580]  I don't know if you can.
[47:47.580 --> 47:50.180]  This is all an idea.
[47:51.060 --> 47:54.340]  I'm trying to think an arbitrary number, but I don't want to give you a number of what
[47:54.340 --> 47:57.380]  my ECs come out at the end of the week.
[47:57.380 --> 47:59.660]  We test every day when we water at my grow.
[47:59.660 --> 48:00.940]  We catch the water.
[48:00.940 --> 48:05.020]  Every table gets the EC tested, the pH tested.
[48:05.020 --> 48:08.620]  It should be in a certain range, but I don't know what you're feeding.
[48:08.620 --> 48:09.900]  I don't know what you're collecting in.
[48:09.900 --> 48:15.020]  I don't want to give you a false hope or a fake guideline.
[48:15.020 --> 48:17.580]  So see how low you can get it in your cocoa.
[48:17.660 --> 48:19.660]  See how much you can flush that shit out.
[48:19.660 --> 48:20.660]  See how low you can get it.
[48:20.660 --> 48:25.100]  You got to go get a EC meter or a PPM pen and see how low you can get it.
[48:25.100 --> 48:26.860]  It's all about the right tools.
[48:26.860 --> 48:27.860]  Yeah.
[48:27.860 --> 48:31.180]  So that's my advice on flushing in just about any medium.
[48:31.180 --> 48:36.740]  If you're using rock wool or whatever else type of hydro stuff like that, you can flush
[48:36.740 --> 48:39.180]  about 10 to 14 days.
[48:39.180 --> 48:44.460]  Seven is maybe enough if you use some sort of product and you go really fast, but I like
[48:44.460 --> 48:47.460]  10 to 14 days.
[48:47.460 --> 48:51.580]  This next question should be pretty quick, but I want to proofread it.
[48:51.580 --> 48:56.340]  So he says, Hey, I was just laughing to myself saying the dang team was giving your strains
[48:56.340 --> 48:57.740]  a name that they made up.
[48:57.740 --> 49:00.820]  I definitely don't agree with them doing that for reasons you stated on the show, but I'd
[49:00.820 --> 49:04.380]  love to hear even in a PM what names they added.
[49:04.380 --> 49:07.820]  So it turns out one of them was called depth charge, which was not my seeds.
[49:07.820 --> 49:09.280]  It was another brand.
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.620]  And then the other one that they just put a label on was they just called it Irie and
[49:12.620 --> 49:14.060]  it was the lemon Jeffrey to a rise.
[49:14.060 --> 49:16.980]  They just slapped the name on it and called it Irie, which if they're going to call it
[49:17.500 --> 49:20.340]  Irie is okay, but there are other strains out there called Irie.
[49:20.340 --> 49:26.660]  Another breeder, uh, use the name Irie OG, but, uh, yeah, I, that's all they did.
[49:26.660 --> 49:27.860]  They just called it Irie.
[49:27.860 --> 49:30.300]  So answer all three of your emails.
[49:30.300 --> 49:34.060]  Since I kept saying your real name on the podcast, hopefully let me leave that in so
[49:34.060 --> 49:38.620]  that I don't have to edit too much.
[49:38.620 --> 49:41.620]  Just get in the habit of saying every email is from rusty Shackleford.
[49:41.620 --> 49:42.620]  Yeah.
[49:42.620 --> 49:47.740]  You guys, when you email me, which you can do with, uh, grow from your heart at hotmail.com,
[49:47.740 --> 49:51.620]  that should be like, instead of high Ross to Jeff, it should just be bold letters.
[49:51.620 --> 49:55.180]  You can, or you cannot use my name on the show.
[49:55.180 --> 49:56.180]  There you go.
[49:56.180 --> 49:57.180]  Start your email with what's what's up.
[49:57.180 --> 50:02.500]  Rasta Jeff do or do not say my name on the podcast or just, yeah, cause that would help
[50:02.500 --> 50:03.500]  me out.
[50:03.500 --> 50:04.500]  I apologize.
[50:04.500 --> 50:08.740]  And if I've busted you out before anybody else, sorry, dude.
[50:08.740 --> 50:09.780]  Keep sending emails.
[50:09.780 --> 50:11.340]  We absolutely love the questions.
[50:11.340 --> 50:12.340]  Yes.
[50:12.340 --> 50:13.900]  Send the emails to grow from your heart at a hotmail.com.
[50:13.900 --> 50:15.260]  I would love to hear from you.
[50:15.260 --> 50:19.660]  I love answering listener emails because that lets me know that I'm actually doing something
[50:19.660 --> 50:20.980]  for at least one person.
[50:20.980 --> 50:21.980]  Yep.
[50:21.980 --> 50:24.020]  And not just rambling over here to Mike being all high.
[50:24.020 --> 50:26.420]  Do they like it when we ramble Mike, those dabs were wiring off.
[50:26.420 --> 50:28.380]  You want to wrap up a podcast and take a couple of dabs.
[50:28.380 --> 50:29.900]  Thinking exactly the same thing.
[50:29.900 --> 50:33.300]  We should, uh, high five, wrap this show up and take another dab.
[50:33.300 --> 50:34.540]  Couple more dabs, dude.
[50:34.540 --> 50:35.540]  Couple more dabs.
[50:35.540 --> 50:36.540]  All right.
[50:36.540 --> 50:38.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, please follow myself on Twitter.
[50:38.020 --> 50:40.000]  Uh, it's at Rasta Jeff for 20.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.600]  You can follow the show at GFYH podcast.
[50:42.600 --> 50:45.640]  You can find the show on Facebook, search for the girl from your heart podcast.
[50:45.640 --> 50:49.180]  Once again, you can email me grow from your heart at a hotmail.com.
[50:49.180 --> 50:53.240]  If you want to follow Mike on social media, he is Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.420]  Facebook is also Nemo punk 15 on the Twitters.
[50:57.420 --> 50:59.040]  Are you doing any Instagram stuff lately?
[50:59.040 --> 51:00.040]  Very, very little.
[51:00.040 --> 51:04.760]  I was just, every time we do a social media shout outs on the show, I smile because we
[51:04.760 --> 51:09.280]  never talk about my Instagram account because it barely exists.
[51:09.560 --> 51:10.560]  I think I've got like seven posts.
[51:10.560 --> 51:11.560]  Nice.
[51:11.560 --> 51:12.560]  How many followers?
[51:12.560 --> 51:13.560]  I have no idea.
[51:13.560 --> 51:14.560]  Less than 50.
[51:14.560 --> 51:15.560]  Okay.
[51:15.560 --> 51:17.560]  Like 48 of them are family.
[51:17.560 --> 51:18.560]  Go find it on Instagram.
[51:18.560 --> 51:24.320]  You guys actually, there's a whole bunch of podcast fans follow me on Instagram.
[51:24.320 --> 51:28.880]  And when I get contacted about the podcast, nine times out of 10, it's through Instagram.
[51:28.880 --> 51:29.880]  Nice.
[51:29.880 --> 51:33.640]  Even though we've never announced my Instagram on the show, uh, several people follow, uh,
[51:33.640 --> 51:35.640]  from Instagram, follow the show on my Instagram.
[51:35.640 --> 51:37.200]  Wait, follow my Instagram from the show.
[51:37.200 --> 51:38.200]  That was hard to say.
[51:38.200 --> 51:39.200]  English is hard.
[51:39.200 --> 51:40.400]  You guys, you go for an hour.
[51:40.400 --> 51:41.880]  Don't say some dumb shit occasionally.
[51:41.880 --> 51:45.280]  Uh, but a lot of people follow me on Instagram and they talk about the show.
[51:45.280 --> 51:49.640]  If you want to follow on Instagram, uh, my Instagram is I re underscore genetics.
[51:49.640 --> 51:54.560]  I R I E underscore G E N E T I C S.
[51:54.560 --> 51:56.160]  I would appreciate a follow click.
[51:56.160 --> 51:57.880]  Like check out the cannabis photography.
[51:57.880 --> 52:01.960]  I post, I've been posting photos from, uh, some caregiver grows that I'm involved in
[52:01.960 --> 52:03.200]  those photos of my own grow.
[52:03.200 --> 52:06.280]  I post photos of the grow at three rivers organics.
[52:06.280 --> 52:10.160]  I just posted a bunch of great pictures of this lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid full
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.160]  spectrum extract.
[52:11.160 --> 52:13.920]  Post a lot of great stuff.
[52:13.920 --> 52:14.920]  You might like to follow it.
[52:14.920 --> 52:15.920]  I would appreciate it.
[52:15.920 --> 52:17.220]  I would also remind you about Patreon.
[52:17.220 --> 52:19.880]  Check out patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[52:19.880 --> 52:20.880]  Help us out a little bit.
[52:20.880 --> 52:22.920]  Keep Mike with a fresh microphone cover.
[52:22.920 --> 52:25.920]  So he doesn't have to smell his own breath all the time.
[52:25.920 --> 52:29.920]  Also if you cannot contribute to Patreon and you want to help us out, you can always go
[52:29.920 --> 52:34.100]  to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search for the grow from your heart podcast, click
[52:34.100 --> 52:35.100]  on the little icon.
[52:35.220 --> 52:36.820]  It's got my ugly face on it.
[52:36.820 --> 52:39.560]  In the middle of the screen, there's a part that says ratings and reviews.
[52:39.560 --> 52:41.080]  Click on there, type in a review.
[52:41.080 --> 52:44.100]  Let me know what you think of the show and give me a star rating that you feel like I
[52:44.100 --> 52:45.100]  deserve.
[52:45.100 --> 52:48.200]  I will read your comments on a future episode.
[52:48.200 --> 52:49.200]  That's always the fun part.
[52:49.200 --> 52:52.260]  You get to hear me read how you feel about the show.
[52:52.260 --> 52:53.260]  Let me know what you think.
[52:53.260 --> 52:54.260]  I'd love to hear from you there.
[52:54.260 --> 52:55.660]  Mike, we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[52:55.660 --> 52:59.460]  Do you have anything else you would like to say while you're on the microphone?
[52:59.460 --> 53:00.800]  Have a good night, everybody.
[53:00.800 --> 53:02.320]  I think he said it best.
[53:02.320 --> 53:03.320]  Have whatever time it is.
[53:03.620 --> 53:05.620]  Have a good later.
[53:05.620 --> 53:07.300]  Have a good right the fuck now.
[53:07.300 --> 53:08.300]  Have a good right now.
[53:08.300 --> 53:09.300]  Have a good everything.
[53:09.300 --> 53:12.480]  Whoever you're with, whatever you're doing, whoever you're doing, whatever you're with,
[53:12.480 --> 53:13.480]  have a good time.
[53:13.480 --> 53:14.480]  All right.
[53:14.480 --> 53:16.440]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Victor at Apothecary.
[53:16.440 --> 53:19.520]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
