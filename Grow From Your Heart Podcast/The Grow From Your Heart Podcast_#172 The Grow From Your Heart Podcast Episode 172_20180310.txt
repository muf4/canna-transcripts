[00:58.400 --> 01:00.880]  If you guys want to follow Mike on Twitter, that'd be awesome.
[01:00.880 --> 01:02.840]  He is at NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[01:02.840 --> 01:03.840]  Give him a follow.
[01:03.840 --> 01:07.880]  Let him know that you learned about him through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:07.880 --> 01:09.920]  Also check out Mike's Facebook page.
[01:09.920 --> 01:12.360]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:12.360 --> 01:13.360]  Make sure you check that out.
[01:13.360 --> 01:14.360]  He would appreciate that.
[01:14.360 --> 01:15.360]  I'm all spot on, man.
[01:15.360 --> 01:16.360]  Well done.
[01:16.360 --> 01:17.360]  I've been trying to remember that.
[01:17.360 --> 01:18.360]  It's a lot of words.
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.360]  It's a lot of mouthfuls of words.
[01:19.360 --> 01:20.360]  It is.
[01:20.360 --> 01:23.360]  When I put that name up there, I had two or three people go, like, too many words.
[01:23.360 --> 01:24.720]  It's like, well, I needed it.
[01:24.720 --> 01:25.720]  It's what it is.
[01:25.720 --> 01:26.720]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:26.720 --> 01:28.520]  It's as succinct as I could make it.
[01:28.520 --> 01:29.760]  It's exactly, it's to the point.
[01:29.760 --> 01:33.140]  If you've been listening to this show, you know succinct isn't really my wheelhouse.
[01:33.140 --> 01:37.000]  That's why I say that this show is the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.360]  It's cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:40.360 --> 01:44.240]  Because if you're looking for the Nike Collector podcast, this obviously is the wrong shit.
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.640]  I like to put it right out there, right at the beginning.
[01:45.640 --> 01:46.640]  No, the intro's perfect.
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.600]  It tells you exactly what you're about to get.
[01:48.600 --> 01:49.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49.600 --> 01:50.600]  There's truth in advertising.
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.880]  If you didn't hear something that sounds good in that intro, you might want to find another
[01:53.880 --> 01:54.880]  show.
[01:54.880 --> 01:55.880]  Yes.
[01:55.880 --> 01:58.800]  If you're looking for fun with boats or fun with maps, this might not be the show for
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.800]  you.
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.560]  The look on your face is priceless, bro.
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.160]  None of the examples for shows that went through my head were so family friendly.
[02:08.160 --> 02:10.200]  Well, you know, I'm trying to be family friendly here.
[02:10.200 --> 02:11.200]  I like it.
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.200]  So make sure you support Mike.
[02:12.200 --> 02:15.520]  That's what I'm trying to do is get people to follow Mike here, namopunk15 on Instagram,
[02:15.520 --> 02:18.640]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook, and of course I would love it if you'd follow

[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  I R I E underscore genetics.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.760]  IRI is a Jamaican word.
[02:41.760 --> 02:44.480]  It means to feel as blessed as you could feel.
[02:44.480 --> 02:48.460]  You know that feeling I describe it as like you're sitting under a tree and the weather
[02:48.460 --> 02:49.560]  is just right.
[02:49.560 --> 02:53.160]  It's kind of sunny, but there's a little bit of breeze and that grass is nice and cool.
[02:53.160 --> 02:58.920]  And either your significant other or your best friend or your dog is sitting right next
[02:58.920 --> 03:01.960]  to you and you don't got to worry in the fucking world.
[03:01.960 --> 03:02.960]  Everything is just right.
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.720]  You're feeling IRI.
[03:04.720 --> 03:06.580]  Everything is perfect.
[03:06.580 --> 03:08.960]  So IRI, IRI genetics, it's just feeling good.
[03:08.960 --> 03:12.240]  It's the most pleasing, comfortable feeling you could get.
[03:12.240 --> 03:13.240]  Just feeling all right.
[03:13.240 --> 03:14.240]  Everything be IRI.
[03:14.240 --> 03:15.240]  I'm good.
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.240]  So IRI genetics, you guys follow me there on Instagram.
[03:17.240 --> 03:19.600]  I post a whole bunch of great cannabis photography.
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.600]  I post pictures of myself with famous comedians, post pictures of male plants.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.800]  Not a lot of weed growers and breeders are posting pictures.
[03:25.800 --> 03:26.800]  They're males.
[03:26.800 --> 03:28.840]  I put pictures of King Solomon up there all the time.
[03:29.760 --> 03:30.760]  I think you would appreciate it.
[03:30.760 --> 03:32.120]  It'd be a good time.
[03:32.120 --> 03:34.080]  So I think I covered all of the social media outlets.
[03:34.080 --> 03:35.720]  Oh, if you want to contact me, there you go.
[03:35.720 --> 03:39.960]  You can hit me up at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:39.960 --> 03:43.560]  If you've got questions or comments or concerns, I'd love to hear from you.
[03:43.560 --> 03:44.560]  We'll answer all that stuff.
[03:44.560 --> 03:45.560]  We'll handle it.
[03:45.560 --> 03:46.840]  Mike, you got a shitty grin on your face, bro.
[03:46.840 --> 03:47.840]  What's going on over there?
[03:47.840 --> 03:50.120]  Oh, there's, it's just, there's so much now.
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.480]  Oh, there is a lot of, I just had a little flashback to, it was like, how do you get
[03:54.480 --> 03:55.480]  ahold of me?
[03:55.480 --> 03:57.480]  And you had two options.
[03:57.520 --> 03:59.560]  Are you going to give them your address or your phone number?
[03:59.560 --> 04:00.560]  Right.
[04:00.560 --> 04:05.280]  And now it's like, well, I have 36 different ways you can get ahold of me on social media
[04:05.280 --> 04:08.600]  and the old school ways doesn't don't matter anymore.
[04:08.600 --> 04:11.440]  Well, but now there's no way to duck in anybody.
[04:11.440 --> 04:12.440]  Like right.
[04:12.440 --> 04:13.840]  Cause they can, they can see that you tweeted.
[04:13.840 --> 04:14.840]  Why didn't you call me back?
[04:14.840 --> 04:15.840]  I see you tweeting.
[04:15.840 --> 04:16.840]  Right.
[04:16.840 --> 04:17.840]  If you're tweeting, you had time to text.
[04:17.840 --> 04:20.920]  Like I see you up on Snapchat showing that you're at the mall.
[04:20.920 --> 04:24.520]  You might be in a meeting, but like if you can tweet from the meeting, you can text me
[04:24.520 --> 04:25.520]  back from the meeting.
[04:25.520 --> 04:26.520]  Come on now.
[04:26.560 --> 04:27.880]  I do have a lot of contact.
[04:27.880 --> 04:33.560]  Or if it shows you this message was seen at two 45, like, and it's four 45 now.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.560]  Why haven't I heard back?
[04:34.560 --> 04:36.320]  That was a question, motherfucker.
[04:36.320 --> 04:39.200]  Like you can't duck anybody now.
[04:39.200 --> 04:41.160]  No, the social media has got us on lock.
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.320]  You gotta be accountable if you're on a podcast and if you're on more than one podcast and
[04:45.320 --> 04:48.320]  you're out there like a lot of people are, you are accountable for what you say.
[04:48.320 --> 04:51.040]  Cause people will point out that you've made in discrepancies.
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.400]  You said this and this bro, and you'd be like, God damn, it wasn't a lie.
[04:55.400 --> 04:56.400]  I got the date wrong.
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.400]  Cause I'm high.
[04:57.400 --> 04:58.400]  I'm sorry.
[04:58.400 --> 05:01.400]  The first time it hit me, somebody came up to me in public and was like, are you white
[05:01.400 --> 05:02.400]  Mike?
[05:02.400 --> 05:03.400]  I turned around and was like, huh?
[05:03.400 --> 05:08.320]  And I was like, wait, you recognize me from across the store by my, oh fuck.
[05:08.320 --> 05:09.320]  Oh yeah.
[05:09.320 --> 05:14.760]  Like I need to think before I speak a little bit, a little bit more sometimes, but yeah,
[05:14.760 --> 05:18.480]  I was at one love garden supply one time talking to burn big shout out to burn.
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.440]  And there was a normal shopper in there and he paused and he looked at me and I go, what's
[05:22.440 --> 05:23.440]  up man?
[05:23.440 --> 05:26.120]  Cause he was, he like obviously looked at me and stopped like, what the fuck?
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.120]  And I was like, what dude?
[05:27.120 --> 05:28.120]  And I was cool about it.
[05:28.120 --> 05:29.120]  I was like, what's up man?
[05:29.120 --> 05:30.120]  And he's like, you, do you have a podcast?
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.120]  I was like, that's totally me, bro.
[05:31.120 --> 05:33.400]  And he's like, I recognized you by your voice.
[05:33.400 --> 05:34.720]  And I was like, that's fucking funny.
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.160]  So yeah, it's, there are people listening that recognize us by our marvelous, sexy voices.
[05:39.160 --> 05:43.480]  I ran into someone last night, actually, that recognized me from my city council stuff because
[05:43.480 --> 05:45.640]  that's broadcast on live TV.
[05:45.640 --> 05:47.000]  And she goes, I know you.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.840]  And I was like, Oh, from, and she goes, you were on TV at my grandpa's house.
[05:51.840 --> 05:57.000]  I just started laughing cause there's a whole bunch of that.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.240]  This segment of this, the senior citizens down here in Pueblo that watch a lot of local
[06:02.240 --> 06:04.320]  government public access television.
[06:04.320 --> 06:09.560]  And a lot of them really liked me cause I go and give city council shit.
[06:09.560 --> 06:11.880]  And for a while I was doing it about a whole bunch of issues.
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.400]  And so I've got this weird geriatric fan base that loves me.
[06:15.400 --> 06:16.400]  That's creepy.
[06:16.800 --> 06:20.000]  I wasn't aware of it until I was eating lunch one day and I had two senior citizens come
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.440]  up and be like, are you the guy that goes to city council?
[06:22.440 --> 06:23.440]  You look like the guy.
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.140]  Have you ever gotten, are you the guy on the paper smoking weed?
[06:27.140 --> 06:29.460]  Are you the guy in the news that was smoking weed?
[06:29.460 --> 06:31.560]  Only from family.
[06:31.560 --> 06:37.840]  I have, I'm from Southern Colorado, not quite this Southern, but I have family friends throughout
[06:37.840 --> 06:38.840]  the state.
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.240]  A bunch of people up in Monument, oddly enough.
[06:42.240 --> 06:47.280]  And they see our city government stuff and they see a lot of our press.
[06:47.280 --> 06:51.640]  And so they would call further up North to my parents, like, do you know what your son's
[06:51.640 --> 06:52.640]  doing?
[06:52.640 --> 06:53.640]  And my dad's like, he's in his thirties.
[06:53.640 --> 06:56.000]  What the fuck am I going to do about it?
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.360]  But then I would get the phone call from my folks saying like, Hey, you know, at so and
[07:00.360 --> 07:03.040]  so, yeah, she saw you on the news.
[07:03.040 --> 07:04.480]  What was that you were doing?
[07:04.480 --> 07:05.480]  Dabbing?
[07:05.480 --> 07:06.480]  Yeah.
[07:06.480 --> 07:12.400]  So Mike and I, I happened to be the first person to buy recreational cannabis in the
[07:12.400 --> 07:14.160]  County of Pueblo, Colorado.
[07:14.160 --> 07:17.160]  When we legalized the sale of recreational cannabis.
[07:17.160 --> 07:22.860]  Photos of the line Jeff got to be first in are still used all the time in national press
[07:22.860 --> 07:25.100]  stories about legalization.
[07:25.100 --> 07:28.360]  There's two photos that were taken that day in Pueblo.
[07:28.360 --> 07:32.720]  They're both aerial shots and Jeff is shopping while that photo was being taken.
[07:32.720 --> 07:34.080]  I'm first.
[07:34.080 --> 07:35.840]  So I'm in there buying this stuff.
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.240]  But those are, I mean, this has been years now and I saw it on NBC like a week ago.
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.240]  Nice.
[07:42.240 --> 07:44.320]  That's where I'm headed is I was first.
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.520]  And so I've got a picture of myself actually purchasing cannabis, like the money transaction
[07:49.520 --> 07:50.880]  of handing him money.
[07:50.880 --> 07:53.040]  And then the owner of the dispensary is a good friend of mine.
[07:53.040 --> 07:54.600]  So I shook his hand like, thanks bro.
[07:54.600 --> 07:56.360]  I'm glad that I could be your first customer.
[07:56.360 --> 08:00.520]  I'm proud of you for having this fucking landmark or milestone.
[08:00.520 --> 08:02.360]  I shook his hand, told him, thank you.
[08:02.360 --> 08:04.760]  I turned around to my other friends at work and I said, thanks guys.
[08:04.760 --> 08:05.760]  And I grabbed my stuff and I left.
[08:05.760 --> 08:12.440]  And when I walked outside, I was interviewed by eight news stations and documentary makers
[08:12.440 --> 08:13.920]  and documentarians, I guess.
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.840]  But there were a lot of cameras around me.
[08:15.840 --> 08:17.680]  I'm really glad that I'm a well-spoken dude.
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.520]  Cause that would have been overwhelming for the fucking most normal people.
[08:20.520 --> 08:22.040]  That was crazy.
[08:22.040 --> 08:23.520]  But a lot of that footage.
[08:23.520 --> 08:28.280]  So also that day there was a newscaster there who I ended up making friends with.
[08:28.280 --> 08:33.320]  And she was like, Hey, we're looking for, they actually asked me if I could smoke there.
[08:33.880 --> 08:34.880]  They're like, can you roll a joint?
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.320]  She didn't know what to call it.
[08:36.320 --> 08:39.680]  She's like, can you roll a cigarette and smoke it here with your friends so that we can film
[08:39.680 --> 08:40.680]  that?
[08:40.680 --> 08:42.080]  And I was like, actually, that's highly illegal.
[08:42.080 --> 08:44.920]  I can't smoke in front of my friend's facility.
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.360]  And we put a little plan together and I was like, let's go to my house.
[08:49.360 --> 08:52.160]  Let's all meet at my house at one o'clock and smoke.
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.720]  And so I drove here with Mike joined me and our friend Wade came and we came here and
[08:57.720 --> 09:00.520]  kind of put, uh, we did some prop placing.
[09:00.520 --> 09:01.960]  We put some product placement happened.
[09:02.080 --> 09:04.200]  And there were a couple of packs of irigenetic seeds on the table.
[09:04.200 --> 09:05.200]  We had fun with it.
[09:05.200 --> 09:11.160]  We, we set up some really nice shots for them to get in.
[09:11.160 --> 09:20.720]  We didn't think about the optics of it necessarily from people who aren't from, because we were
[09:20.720 --> 09:23.360]  used to dabbing by then.
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.560]  We were used to the equipment that goes with it.
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.960]  The parts, the process, the people that came over to interview us and see this little session,
[09:32.960 --> 09:35.720]  none of them were familiar with it.
[09:35.720 --> 09:37.560]  Never seen a dab.
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.120]  The one lady there.
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.600]  So there was a cameraman, there was a news reporter who was from the TV news.
[09:43.600 --> 09:50.720]  And then there was a right, a newspaper writer and the newspaper writer hinted, mentioned,
[09:50.720 --> 09:52.920]  talked about cannabis, that she liked cannabis.
[09:52.920 --> 09:57.640]  She wanted to say, she was saying without saying, I'd love to fucking smoke that bull
[09:57.640 --> 10:03.360]  with you guys, but all these assholes right here would snitch on me is what she was saying.
[10:03.360 --> 10:08.800]  And we did our best to completely hot box, basically a suburban home.
[10:08.800 --> 10:09.800]  Yeah.
[10:09.800 --> 10:12.120]  Um, and it didn't take much with three grown men here.
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.120]  Yeah.
[10:13.120 --> 10:16.960]  In the 20, 30 minutes they were here filming and interviewing people.
[10:16.960 --> 10:22.360]  We nonstop had a dab rig and a bowl and a joint going around the table so that it won
[10:22.800 --> 10:23.800]  in any given moment.
[10:23.800 --> 10:25.360]  One of us was hitting everything.
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.280]  I thought that camera was going to touch me.
[10:27.280 --> 10:29.440]  I was taking a dab, a big dab.
[10:29.440 --> 10:33.680]  I was worried about his, his lens at one point he got really, really close to the nail.
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.480]  And I was like, bro, that's like a couple hundred degrees.
[10:37.480 --> 10:39.560]  You really don't want to get any closer.
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.360]  But that, that shot, that actual shot is shown on the news all the time.
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.680]  So frequently when they talk about marijuana, they show me take a big dab and blow it out.
[10:48.680 --> 10:50.440]  Like, Oh, I feel relieved.
[10:50.440 --> 10:51.440]  Yeah.
[10:51.520 --> 10:52.520]  Cool.
[10:52.520 --> 10:54.640]  I'm sure that that is interesting.
[10:54.640 --> 11:00.920]  So luckily they don't use me taking a dab, um, nearly as frequently as they use you,
[11:00.920 --> 11:03.000]  but they still use that footage regularly.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.040]  And it's been years now that footage we saw, we agreed that that footage can be used in
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.040]  anything.
[11:09.040 --> 11:12.440]  It's like either ABC or NBC is what news organization that was for.
[11:12.440 --> 11:14.040]  So it's theirs now.
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.920]  And so it's shown all over the nation when they talk about cannabis and I get messages
[11:17.920 --> 11:20.880]  from people all over like, Hey, I just saw you on my news.
[11:21.320 --> 11:28.240]  I'm like, yeah, task rock actually sent me a gift because his email was on the news.
[11:28.240 --> 11:30.240]  He's like this guy right here, got an email on the news.
[11:30.240 --> 11:32.840]  He's hitting the email on the news and he sent me a gift.
[11:32.840 --> 11:35.840]  I thought it was pretty cool.
[11:35.840 --> 11:36.840]  Yup.
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.960]  Um, Colorado affords us a lot of fun little opportunities like that.
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.400]  I've been on the news taking a dab in my kitchen, my dining room here at this table, at this
[11:45.400 --> 11:46.400]  dab table.
[11:46.400 --> 11:49.520]  This was, I was sitting, I'm sitting now where I was sitting then.
[11:49.520 --> 11:50.520]  I of course am.
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.160]  I've got this, I've got the Sheldon Cooper OCD where this is my seat, but it's where
[11:55.160 --> 11:56.360]  the controls are.
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.360]  It has to be.
[11:57.360 --> 11:59.120]  It's got to, I'd go nuts without it.
[11:59.120 --> 12:01.080]  You guys, there's going to be a point to this podcast.
[12:01.080 --> 12:04.400]  We were 12 minutes in and I haven't even told you what the topic is.
[12:04.400 --> 12:07.880]  Should we mention that the goal was very little rambling for this show.
[12:07.880 --> 12:10.640]  Yeah, I did say it was kind of minutes of intro and rambles.
[12:10.640 --> 12:11.640]  I love you guys.
[12:11.640 --> 12:13.960]  I haven't even done the ad I'm supposed to do.
[12:13.960 --> 12:14.960]  You guys are wonderful.
[12:14.960 --> 12:19.760]  Thank you so much for supporting the podcast and listen to our high asses ramble.
[12:19.760 --> 12:21.760]  We love you and we love that you love us.
[12:21.760 --> 12:23.200]  You know who else I love?
[12:23.200 --> 12:25.920]  I love my friends at handmade apparel, my friends at handmade apparel.
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.600]  They keep me stocked with dope ass t-shirts and dope hoodies.
[12:28.600 --> 12:29.600]  Keep me warm tonight.
[12:29.600 --> 12:30.600]  Thank you handmade.
[12:30.600 --> 12:31.600]  Yeah, right, right.
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.680]  You're the second person I saw leaving here now.
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.320]  Grow from your heart podcast hoodie and another person left here in a red handmade apparel
[12:39.320 --> 12:44.040]  hoodie with a big white logo on it and it looks really good on her.
[12:44.040 --> 12:47.080]  I'm at that age where I don't care what your brand is.
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.920]  If your logo isn't hideous and it's a really good quality item, I'm in.
[12:52.920 --> 12:56.200]  That's what I like about handmade is it's really, really high quality stuff.
[12:56.200 --> 12:58.880]  They get what they get you the best hoodies they can start with.
[12:58.880 --> 13:01.120]  I think they're the gildan.
[13:01.120 --> 13:02.120]  It's snuggly.
[13:02.120 --> 13:03.120]  It's super cozy.
[13:03.120 --> 13:05.480]  Like when you put it on, you're like, oh yeah, it was cozy.
[13:05.480 --> 13:07.960]  It's so snuggly and I'm a big dude and I feel all cozy in it.
[13:07.960 --> 13:08.960]  So that's weird.
[13:08.960 --> 13:11.640]  And then the printing quality that these guys do.
[13:11.640 --> 13:14.080]  My logo of course is red, yellow, green.
[13:14.080 --> 13:15.080]  There's white in there.
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.520]  There's black and then there's like a skin tone and then there's whatever color they
[13:18.520 --> 13:20.480]  call that for my dreadlocks that they use.
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.240]  They're like nine colors and the color of this design that they made for me and every
[13:25.240 --> 13:27.120]  single color pops.
[13:27.120 --> 13:28.120]  It all pops.
[13:28.120 --> 13:29.120]  I got your back bro.
[13:29.120 --> 13:30.120]  You're cool.
[13:30.120 --> 13:32.520]  Mike just freaked out cause he turned to look at the hoodies and I felt the headphone cord
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.000]  snag and then I heard the rig move in that mini heart attack.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  I moved it.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.760]  That's all I was watching out for my rig.
[13:39.760 --> 13:40.760]  I moved it for you.
[13:40.760 --> 13:43.240]  There's no, no glass spillage here, but these hoodies look wonderful.
[13:43.400 --> 13:45.680]  You guys, I'm not just trying to sell you my hoodies.
[13:45.680 --> 13:47.400]  Handmade apparel can make your hoodies.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.440]  Hand Merrill handmade apparel can make your t-shirts handmade.
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.240]  Let me slow down and say this in English you guys, because I want to get this right for
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.080]  my friends because they do a lot of good hard work for me and I owe them the proper ad.
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.320]  My friends at handmade apparel can make your t-shirts and your hoodies and your stickers
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.640]  and your happens.
[14:03.640 --> 14:05.240]  They can help you with the artwork.
[14:05.240 --> 14:07.560]  They can get your stuff to you in a timely manner.
[14:07.560 --> 14:08.560]  They're good people.
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.240]  They support the cannabis industry.
[14:10.240 --> 14:12.080]  They are dab kids.
[14:12.080 --> 14:13.080]  They're my friends.
[14:13.920 --> 14:16.200]  So there's no reason why you should not shop with handmade apparel.
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.240]  All you got to do, all you've got to fucking English is hard to do.
[14:19.240 --> 14:21.840]  You guys, I'm going to either take another dab or something to figure this out.
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.520]  All you've got to do is go to handmade apparel dot biz and check them out.
[14:26.520 --> 14:30.160]  Tell them that Rasta Jeff from the grow from your heart podcast sent you and they will
[14:30.160 --> 14:33.880]  hook you up with the best deal possible to get your products printed.
[14:33.880 --> 14:38.480]  I think they've got a 25 piece minimum, so they'll charge you for 25 pieces plus a small
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.160]  setup fee because they do have to make screens to say, I'm not sure if they're screens anymore.
[14:42.240 --> 14:43.240]  I don't know how that shit happens.
[14:43.240 --> 14:45.440]  I'm not a printer, but they got to get you set up.
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.720]  They do a really decent job with an amazing level of quality.
[14:49.720 --> 14:51.600]  They do a damn good job.
[14:51.600 --> 14:52.600]  Way better than for a really good price.
[14:52.600 --> 14:55.600]  It should be mad decent, yo, but they do a really good job.
[14:55.600 --> 14:57.160]  I love what they do.
[14:57.160 --> 14:58.240]  They've sent me stickers.
[14:58.240 --> 14:59.640]  They've sent me shirts.
[14:59.640 --> 15:01.160]  They've sent me, and it's not just my stuff.
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.720]  I've got shirts that they've printed for other brands that they didn't know were coming to
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.440]  me that I got from those people and all their stuff looks quality also.
[15:08.440 --> 15:10.520]  So much love, much respect to handmade apparel.
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.960]  Let them know that you're listening to the grow from your heart podcast.
[15:12.960 --> 15:16.500]  I love supporting my friends in the industry that are doing stuff for us.
[15:16.500 --> 15:19.760]  If you're interested in one of these hoodies, send me an email to grow from your heart at
[15:19.760 --> 15:20.760]  hotmail.com.
[15:20.760 --> 15:23.240]  Uh, they are very limited on quantity.
[15:23.240 --> 15:24.960]  I got 25 of them printed.
[15:24.960 --> 15:28.280]  Uh, I've got a lot of friends that have been on the show that have already picked them
[15:28.280 --> 15:29.280]  up.
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.640]  Mike's going to leave here today looking stylish as fuck in his new grow from your heart podcast
[15:32.640 --> 15:33.640]  hoodie.
[15:33.640 --> 15:36.600]  It's got the grow from your heart podcast logo above the left breast.
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.520]  It just says grow from your heart and it's got the little EQ bars and red, yellow, and
[15:40.520 --> 15:41.520]  green.
[15:41.520 --> 15:42.800]  It does not have my face.
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.280]  However, on the back, it's got the logo very large and it's got the original logo with
[15:47.280 --> 15:49.280]  my face and the EQ bars on it.
[15:49.280 --> 15:50.280]  It looks sweet.
[15:50.280 --> 15:51.680]  A shout out to a handmade apparel.
[15:51.680 --> 15:53.560]  So I think it was Adam hand that did it himself.
[15:53.560 --> 15:58.640]  I think Adam hand adjusted the art because the art I sent him was a little pixel.
[15:58.640 --> 16:00.880]  Uh, I was made by it up a little.
[16:00.880 --> 16:01.880]  Yeah.
[16:01.880 --> 16:02.880]  Yeah.
[16:02.880 --> 16:03.880]  It was made by somebody else.
[16:03.880 --> 16:06.800]  It was made by an amazing graphic artist, but it was the right idea for what I wanted.
[16:06.800 --> 16:08.160]  Handmade apparel took it and polished it up.
[16:08.160 --> 16:09.160]  It looks super dope.
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.240]  It looks super slick so they can handle your artwork, everything.
[16:12.240 --> 16:14.920]  And he thinks very open-mindedly.
[16:14.920 --> 16:19.840]  So if he describes something to Adam, he can draw it without ruining your idea.
[16:19.840 --> 16:23.920]  He can put your idea into motion if you're not an artist, which is really cool because
[16:23.920 --> 16:29.000]  a lot of artists want to put their idea into your idea and then put it on paper and then
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.000]  there goes your idea.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.560]  And yeah, so yeah.
[16:31.640 --> 16:35.000]  Anyway, uh, much love, mad respect to our friends at handmade apparel.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.400]  Let's tell everybody what this show is going to be about because I feel like we've been
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.960]  going on for a really long time and we haven't really dabbed out in a rambling.
[16:41.960 --> 16:44.880]  That's what life is to be about tonight.
[16:44.880 --> 16:46.880]  There's a today's shows.
[16:46.880 --> 16:50.840]  There's some rule changes that came down the pipe for Colorado concentrate companies.
[16:50.840 --> 16:51.840]  Yes.
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.080]  I found this article on leafly because it was the only place I could find with this
[16:55.080 --> 17:01.520]  article after I did some searching and it says rule changes aren't, they're not sexy.
[17:02.080 --> 17:04.640]  And so they didn't make the press.
[17:04.640 --> 17:06.400]  There's no other way to describe it.
[17:06.400 --> 17:10.400]  It's, it's not, um, it's not something controversial.
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.960]  It's not something that there was big heated debate over.
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.480]  Um, we're like anti-pop people and pro-pop people were fighting in the courthouse or
[17:20.480 --> 17:21.480]  anything.
[17:21.480 --> 17:22.480]  So it didn't make the press a lot.
[17:22.480 --> 17:23.480]  It was quiet.
[17:23.480 --> 17:24.480]  All right, let's read the article.
[17:24.480 --> 17:25.480]  Uh, this is from leafly.
[17:25.480 --> 17:29.720]  I'm looking for the author, Ben Alden, and this was written on December 12th, 2016.
[17:29.720 --> 17:32.080]  Of course, this episode is coming out on December 26th.
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.840]  I hope everybody had a wonderful winter holiday, whichever one that it is you celebrate.
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.200]  We're not going to be inclusive, exclusive, racist, or biased or whatever.
[17:41.200 --> 17:42.200]  We love you all.
[17:42.200 --> 17:47.080]  Whatever gender you have chosen to identify as whatever holiday you are accepting.
[17:47.080 --> 17:48.840]  I'm in a happy holidays.
[17:48.840 --> 17:49.840]  Everybody.
[17:49.840 --> 17:50.840]  That's the truth.
[17:50.840 --> 17:51.840]  All right.
[17:51.840 --> 17:55.240]  Article goes like this on January 1st, 2017, Colorado will raise its state regulated limit
[17:55.240 --> 18:00.240]  on the residual levels of volatile solvents allowed in cannabis concentrates.
[18:00.240 --> 18:04.440]  It's a little noticed rule change that involves dramatically increased levels of allowable
[18:04.440 --> 18:05.440]  solvents.
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.120]  Among the changes, and I'm going to read off some of the changes they list here.
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.200]  The legal threshold for butane, the solvent that puts the B and BHO will increase more
[18:12.200 --> 18:17.880]  than six fold from 800 parts per million to 5,000 parts per million.
[18:17.880 --> 18:21.360]  I think I should slow down and kind of explain what that means.
[18:21.360 --> 18:24.720]  Um, so PPM means parts per million.
[18:24.720 --> 18:27.040]  That means that parts per million, right?
[18:27.040 --> 18:30.680]  That there are, so if there are a million parts in there, you're allowed to have 800
[18:30.680 --> 18:33.760]  parts of butane in there before out of a million, which isn't a lot.
[18:33.760 --> 18:34.920]  You probably wouldn't notice that, right?
[18:34.920 --> 18:37.840]  If I gave you a million something and told you, pick me at 800 of them and give them
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.840]  to me, you wouldn't notice you're missing anything.
[18:39.840 --> 18:40.840]  Nope.
[18:40.840 --> 18:45.120]  Now you're allowed to have 5,000, which may start making a little bit of a difference.
[18:45.120 --> 18:46.480]  You may show that up.
[18:46.480 --> 18:54.120]  5,000 PPMs of residual solvents of butane feels like a whole lot of butane to me.
[18:54.120 --> 19:02.600]  It's a larger number, but without significantly more context, um, it's not helpful information.
[19:02.600 --> 19:10.480]  I know for a fact that given the boiling points, um, I mean even like really, really, really,
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.480]  really high amounts of butane left in final product, all of that cooks off long before
[19:16.480 --> 19:17.480]  dab to face.
[19:17.480 --> 19:18.480]  Right.
[19:18.480 --> 19:21.160]  It comes off at the nail if you're getting that much.
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.560]  If there's anything, if there's much of anything left over in the product, it's gone on the
[19:25.560 --> 19:28.320]  nail long before the dab gets to you.
[19:28.320 --> 19:29.320]  Okay.
[19:29.320 --> 19:31.240]  Um, with, with butane.
[19:31.240 --> 19:35.360]  Um, but if it, if it was harmful, they wouldn't be making these changes.
[19:35.360 --> 19:40.000]  Well, we don't, I don't think we have enough information yet to know how harmful smoking
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.560]  a concentrate made from butane could be.
[19:43.560 --> 19:46.360]  And that's from, and I'm a heavy BHO advocate.
[19:46.360 --> 19:50.040]  I probably smoke more BHO than 90% of the world.
[19:50.040 --> 19:54.400]  Most of the health rules that they haven't been able to research specifically for cannabis,
[19:54.400 --> 19:57.800]  they have already researched specifically for similar items.
[19:57.800 --> 19:58.800]  True.
[19:58.800 --> 20:03.440]  We know a lot about pesticide residual limits because of the tobacco industry.
[20:03.440 --> 20:07.960]  There's already something that's mass produced that's smoked.
[20:07.960 --> 20:11.200]  We know PPM limits from some other things for like inhaled medicines.
[20:11.200 --> 20:12.200]  All right.
[20:12.200 --> 20:14.440]  Let me keep going to the article cause it mentioned stuff like that.
[20:14.440 --> 20:16.760]  I've pre-read, I did some research.
[20:16.760 --> 20:19.940]  This also another rule allowed residuals for heptanes.
[20:19.940 --> 20:23.280]  Another class of solvents will go up by a factor of 10.
[20:23.280 --> 20:27.760]  Xylenes, industrial solvents that technically aren't allowed to be used for cannabis extraction
[20:27.760 --> 20:35.520]  at all will be permitted at concentrations of up to 2,170 particles per million, significantly
[20:35.520 --> 20:39.960]  higher than the premium previous limit of one PPM.
[20:39.960 --> 20:44.600]  The state residual limit on benzene, perhaps the most hazardous chemical of the group will
[20:44.600 --> 20:50.640]  double from less than one PPM to less than two PPMs.
[20:50.640 --> 20:53.720]  There's a little article here that gives you a graph that is way too small to read.
[20:53.720 --> 20:58.120]  Well, I mean, that's a good example of how statistics can sound scary.
[20:58.120 --> 21:01.720]  It's going to more than double from less than one to almost two.
[21:01.720 --> 21:02.720]  To almost two.
[21:02.720 --> 21:07.000]  Like, but depending on how dangerous those chemicals are, that can make a difference.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.600]  And there's something I want to talk about once we get rid of the work done through the
[21:09.600 --> 21:10.600]  article.
[21:10.600 --> 21:14.320]  It goes on to say on the surface, these are staggering increases in chemicals that at
[21:15.040 --> 21:18.480]  some levels have been associated with nausea, irregular heartbeat, increased risk of cancer
[21:18.480 --> 21:20.120]  and even death.
[21:20.120 --> 21:24.880]  Regulators, testing laboratory operators and industry members in other states have expressed
[21:24.880 --> 21:30.280]  surprises at the changes, which will apply to both adult use and medical markets.
[21:30.280 --> 21:35.120]  Mike Van Dyke, chief of the environmental epidemiology, occupational health and toxicology
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.880]  branch at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment will recommend the
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.480]  new limit, acknowledge that, which recommended the new limit, acknowledge that concentrates
[21:43.480 --> 21:47.360]  capable of clearing the regulatory hurdles could be noticeably different from what's
[21:47.360 --> 21:49.400]  currently allowed.
[21:49.400 --> 21:52.160]  Consumers are going to feel like they may taste it.
[21:52.160 --> 21:56.320]  He said of these new allowed butane levels, they might smell it.
[21:56.320 --> 21:59.160]  I'm surprised nobody else has even actually been interested in this.
[21:59.160 --> 22:04.400]  He told me in an interview just last week, the guys making these rules are saying that
[22:04.400 --> 22:09.240]  we are going to taste and smell butane in our concentrates with these.
[22:09.240 --> 22:11.320]  Not possible at those levels.
[22:11.320 --> 22:16.520]  I don't know enough about how much butane that is to know.
[22:16.520 --> 22:23.960]  Just when you break it down per million, if that whole gram of hash is 1 million pieces,
[22:23.960 --> 22:29.760]  the 5,000 that you're talking about aren't visible.
[22:29.760 --> 22:34.200]  They're not visually identifiable as separatable from the whole.
[22:34.200 --> 22:37.840]  We're talking about an incredibly small amount here.
[22:37.840 --> 22:44.480]  It does surprise me that this didn't make the press because it does increase residual
[22:44.480 --> 22:45.480]  solvents.
[22:45.480 --> 22:52.640]  There's no other way to say that to make it sound better or worse, I don't think.
[22:52.640 --> 22:57.000]  It seems like something that would make the press, but it was reported almost nowhere.
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.840]  The only reason I know about this rule change is because of the labeling rules that came
[23:01.840 --> 23:02.840]  along with it.
[23:02.840 --> 23:03.840]  Oh, yeah.
[23:04.840 --> 23:09.840]  A friend of mine was negatively affected by those rules, so I heard about them that way.
[23:09.840 --> 23:10.840]  Oh, yeah.
[23:10.840 --> 23:11.840]  I heard about an incident.
[23:11.840 --> 23:12.840]  Let me continue with the article.
[23:12.840 --> 23:16.800]  It goes on to say, there are a few things Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's
[23:16.800 --> 23:19.240]  Van Dyke wants to make clear about the new rules.
[23:19.240 --> 23:20.240]  Here is one.
[23:20.240 --> 23:23.400]  This change was not a result of any industry pressure.
[23:23.400 --> 23:25.920]  The increase didn't come at the behest.
[23:25.920 --> 23:26.920]  What's that word mean?
[23:26.920 --> 23:27.920]  The behest.
[23:27.920 --> 23:28.920]  I know what the word means.
[23:28.920 --> 23:29.920]  I've never read that word before.
[23:29.920 --> 23:30.920]  Because they requested it.
[23:30.920 --> 23:31.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:31.920 --> 23:32.920]  Or pushed for it.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  You got it.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  The increase did not come at the behest of lobbyists, he told Leafly.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.880]  In fact, in the work groups, if we heard anything from the industry, I think we heard the other
[23:40.880 --> 23:45.240]  side that these were too high, he said, which is an uncommon place to be.
[23:45.240 --> 23:46.560]  So what's going on?
[23:46.560 --> 23:50.120]  The justification for the change, according to Van Dyke, is that the new limits truly
[23:50.120 --> 23:54.540]  follow the best currently available medical and scientific guidance.
[23:54.540 --> 23:58.640]  This was re-evaluated based on trying to make things health-based, he explained.
[23:58.640 --> 24:03.240]  These numbers come from the International Harmonized Guidelines for Residual Solvents
[24:03.240 --> 24:05.080]  and Pharmaceuticals.
[24:05.080 --> 24:11.120]  Van Dyke is referring to a published scientific article he cited in a July letter to Jim Barak,
[24:11.120 --> 24:15.000]  director of the Colorado Department of Revenue's Enforcement Division, which is in charge of
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.080]  enforcing the new standards.
[24:17.080 --> 24:21.800]  Van Dyke provided the letter and spoke at length to Leafly about the coming change.
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.440]  Will these numbers stand the test of time?
[24:23.440 --> 24:24.760]  I don't know, he said.
[24:24.760 --> 24:28.520]  We're open to new data that comes out, but our goal is to make sure that we maintain
[24:28.520 --> 24:34.840]  the best we can, the best evidence-based regulations for health.
[24:34.840 --> 24:38.280]  The agency is trying to do precisely what has been asked, Van Dyke said.
[24:38.280 --> 24:44.600]  Legislation passed this year, then is listed in the House Bill 16-1261, put the Colorado
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.520]  Department of Public Health and Environment in charge of recommending testing standards
[24:48.520 --> 24:51.960]  based on medical reports and published scientific literature.
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.120]  When the Colorado Department of Revenue set the previous limits in the wake of Amendment
[24:56.120 --> 24:59.920]  64's passage, it was a fast and furious process.
[24:59.920 --> 25:03.240]  Van Dyke said, there were times you came up with numbers because that's what you came
[25:03.240 --> 25:04.640]  up with at the time.
[25:04.640 --> 25:09.280]  Despite the eye-popping increases, he said new limits adhere more strictly to the latest
[25:09.280 --> 25:13.240]  available evidence in scientific research.
[25:13.240 --> 25:16.360]  There's a lot more to this, I'm going to skim it real quick.
[25:16.360 --> 25:17.360]  Go ahead, Mike.
[25:18.360 --> 25:25.400]  That model of, we picked a number and we kind of pulled it out of our ass, but we just went
[25:25.400 --> 25:31.520]  with the much more restrictive sounding rule to start off with, and now we're dialing it
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.040]  back to more in line with reality.
[25:35.040 --> 25:40.360]  I think we're going to see that in a lot of different areas of regulation in Colorado.
[25:40.360 --> 25:45.040]  We're realizing that in a lot of ways, we way overdid it in some areas.
[25:45.040 --> 25:48.880]  It doesn't surprise me that this is one.
[25:48.880 --> 25:55.560]  I wouldn't be surprised in the next two years to see a lot of different testing rules and
[25:55.560 --> 26:02.000]  regulations tweaked up and down as we learn more and we finally get around to checking
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.880]  the research.
[26:03.880 --> 26:10.240]  Our driving limit, for example, the five nanograms, that's just a rule another state had in place
[26:10.240 --> 26:13.280]  and they just pulled it out of their ass.
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.440]  There's no research at all to tie it with that, but we made that part of our law here.
[26:17.440 --> 26:22.280]  I wouldn't be allowed near a car on five nanograms, it was a real thing.
[26:22.280 --> 26:28.160]  I tried to have my primary care physician run the test on me after not smoking all night
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.120]  and then going in in the morning and she didn't know which test to run.
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.400]  I had her run three different THC tests and all of them, whatever the test result came
[26:37.400 --> 26:42.120]  back, I was way above five.
[26:42.840 --> 26:44.120]  We're doing that research now.
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.880]  That research just got funded in Colorado.
[26:45.880 --> 26:51.120]  In two years, three years, we'll have more information to change that rule.
[26:51.120 --> 26:52.760]  I think that's going to happen in a lot of places.
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.600]  It doesn't surprise me that it's happening here with PPM limits.
[26:55.600 --> 26:59.360]  Well, the article keeps going and the guy says, actually, frankly, no, he doesn't say
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.480]  actually, he actually says, frankly, we're not saying that extracted marijuana products
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.680]  should have 5,000 PPMs of butane in them in Colorado.
[27:07.680 --> 27:10.880]  He said, what we're saying is 5,000 is a health-based limit.
[27:10.880 --> 27:13.800]  Then it goes on, sorry, I'm reading way too fast.
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.280]  But didn't he just acknowledge the possibility of literally smelling butane in the BHO approved
[27:18.280 --> 27:20.400]  by the state for medical patients?
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.640]  I think there may be a lot of market drivers that push those numbers lower, Van Dyck acknowledged,
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.680]  and smell could certainly be one of them.
[27:27.680 --> 27:32.040]  But he repeated, it's not from a health perspective that those numbers should be lower.
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.680]  But there are residual solvents, but are residual solvents merely a matter of product
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.600]  taste and quality or is scientific research still too limited to inspire consumer confidence?
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.560]  It may be a little bit of both.
[27:45.560 --> 27:51.600]  That's what I'm going to jump in right now because even if we're allowed to put 5,000
[27:51.600 --> 27:56.460]  particles per million to leave that in there and not purge it out properly, most consumers
[27:56.460 --> 27:59.320]  are educated enough to go, I don't want that shit.
[27:59.320 --> 28:00.320]  They would go by.
[28:00.480 --> 28:03.760]  So I've got two different products of shatter on my table right now.
[28:03.760 --> 28:06.600]  One was a gift.
[28:06.600 --> 28:10.160]  One will probably remain on this piece of parchment paper until the end of fucking time
[28:10.160 --> 28:12.320]  because I do not want to dab it.
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.960]  The other, however, was made by an artist who took their time and their energy.
[28:17.960 --> 28:22.080]  Now if you went to the dispensary, Mike, and this dark stuff that looks like squirrel poop
[28:22.080 --> 28:26.040]  was here available for you for $25 a gram plus tax.
[28:26.040 --> 28:28.240]  It looks like a piece of onyx.
[28:28.240 --> 28:29.240]  It is pretty dark.
[28:29.240 --> 28:33.320]  It is pretty damn dark or this golden shiny sparkly stuff here.
[28:33.320 --> 28:35.360]  It's like pancake syrup.
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.240]  It does look like thin maple syrup on nice and it's kind of gold.
[28:39.240 --> 28:43.480]  The syrup that's spilled on the white plate is exactly what it looks like.
[28:43.480 --> 28:45.000]  Which one would you grab all day long?
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.200]  All day long, my honey.
[28:46.200 --> 28:48.600]  And if this was at the store, would you even buy it?
[28:48.600 --> 28:49.600]  Nope.
[28:49.600 --> 28:51.120]  See, so you're an educated consumer like myself.
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.000]  And I even know that a lot of times you get that dark color just because the material
[28:55.000 --> 29:01.200]  wasn't processed quickly enough and it had time to age a little bit before it got processed.
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.360]  I believe that that hash, and if you're listening to my podcast, my friend that makes this hash,
[29:05.360 --> 29:06.360]  you may listen.
[29:06.360 --> 29:08.040]  I did not tell you this when you were here the other day.
[29:08.040 --> 29:10.240]  We were just doing our thing and I didn't want to mention this.
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.940]  I think what's happening is if you're using a closed loop system, the material is sitting
[29:14.940 --> 29:17.480]  in the butane far too long.
[29:17.480 --> 29:22.480]  He was talking about this was his record pool, how they got more hash from the amount of
[29:22.480 --> 29:25.800]  material than they've ever pulled before.
[29:25.800 --> 29:28.280]  It's because you've pulled out a bunch of chlorophyll, my friend.
[29:28.280 --> 29:30.640]  That's why the hash has got this dark greenish color.
[29:30.640 --> 29:36.200]  Yes, there's a lot of THC here, but you lowered your THC quantity by pulling more chlorophyll.
[29:36.200 --> 29:38.920]  You increased your weight, but you lowered your potency.
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.400]  So if you're doing it in a closed loop system, be a little quicker about it.
[29:42.400 --> 29:44.720]  Don't leave it soaking in the soak for so long.
[29:44.720 --> 29:47.560]  It's the hash version of putting a coin in your grinder.
[29:47.560 --> 29:50.760]  It may be time to clean the butane and the machine also.
[29:50.760 --> 29:54.680]  If you're doing this, if this hash was made open blasted, what you did was you ran too
[29:54.680 --> 29:55.680]  many cans.
[29:55.680 --> 29:59.760]  You needed to stop a can before because you're pushing it through the tube.
[29:59.760 --> 30:00.760]  You're pushing it.
[30:00.760 --> 30:02.380]  It's going, pay attention.
[30:02.380 --> 30:04.080]  It should run piss clear.
[30:04.080 --> 30:05.600]  It should look like well hydrated pee.
[30:05.600 --> 30:07.040]  It should be clear coming out of there.
[30:07.040 --> 30:10.920]  As soon as you see it come in dark, stop putting butane through it.
[30:10.920 --> 30:16.320]  I will go as far as to move my can over the grass or over the cement and just drip it
[30:16.320 --> 30:18.560]  right into there and quit putting it into my catch jar.
[30:18.560 --> 30:19.560]  I use a jar.
[30:19.560 --> 30:20.560]  I've seen people do two batch too.
[30:21.360 --> 30:24.960]  When I open a, when I open blast into a open container, I do it into a Mason jar because
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.000]  it's got a smaller opening with a less, I don't do this anymore.
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.240]  Mike, you're looking at me like, don't say that, but I would do it.
[30:31.240 --> 30:34.240]  There's a particular bad idea for a couple of different reasons.
[30:34.240 --> 30:37.400]  Do it into the Mason joy prevents you from getting contaminants into it.
[30:37.400 --> 30:41.880]  If you do it into a big flat Pyrex dish leaves and shit from the trees falling because you
[30:41.880 --> 30:42.880]  got to do it outside.
[30:42.880 --> 30:45.960]  Bugs fly into their fucking butterfly land and then the next one time, the pancake tray
[30:45.960 --> 30:48.400]  or the cookie tray don't make shrapnel though.
[30:48.400 --> 30:49.400]  Yeah.
[30:49.400 --> 30:52.600]  I'm not going to blow anything up the way we, yeah, we, everybody says that.
[30:52.600 --> 30:53.600]  Right.
[30:53.600 --> 30:54.600]  Just don't open blast people.
[30:54.600 --> 30:55.600]  I don't make hash anymore.
[30:55.600 --> 30:57.480]  That's why I feel free talking about it.
[30:57.480 --> 31:01.440]  It's you, it's working with, with butane like that.
[31:01.440 --> 31:07.280]  There's safety precautions that I, it's just one way our community keeps fucking ourselves.
[31:07.280 --> 31:11.520]  Every time I, some idiot blows up their apartment or their house trying to make dabs in the
[31:11.520 --> 31:15.760]  backyard, like just leave it to the fucking professionals.
[31:15.760 --> 31:16.760]  True.
[31:16.760 --> 31:17.760]  I agree with that.
[31:17.760 --> 31:21.560]  I remember reading in history class about bathtub gin and people blowing themselves
[31:21.560 --> 31:23.120]  up trying to make gin in the bathtub.
[31:23.120 --> 31:25.800]  And I thought, how dumb were people back then?
[31:25.800 --> 31:31.080]  And then here I am 35 and my contemporaries are doing the exact same freaking hash.
[31:31.080 --> 31:34.160]  There weren't professionals six years ago.
[31:34.160 --> 31:36.480]  Back then the professionals were us.
[31:36.480 --> 31:37.480]  You know what I mean?
[31:37.480 --> 31:42.960]  Like big D was a professional back then and he was doing it with a fucking, until three
[31:43.080 --> 31:47.560]  years ago he was doing it in a tube in a parking lot or professional business with a license.
[31:47.560 --> 31:49.320]  That's how it, they were okay with that.
[31:49.320 --> 31:53.760]  Like, yeah, now, now you got to have a fucking blast proof building and all kinds of fire
[31:53.760 --> 31:58.140]  equipment and suits and all training and hazmat material.
[31:58.140 --> 32:00.060]  It's a way different world now.
[32:00.060 --> 32:01.740]  So let those professionals do it.
[32:01.740 --> 32:08.600]  And I think that if we legalize cannabis everywhere, well, no, it's definitely a legalization in
[32:08.600 --> 32:09.600]  the market.
[32:09.760 --> 32:17.160]  Because then if a lot of the places where the frequent, um, BHO home cook blowups are
[32:17.160 --> 32:24.680]  happening are in legalization states where it's 65, 75 a gram on the shelf for, um, 75%
[32:24.680 --> 32:26.840]  black shatter where there is no option.
[32:26.840 --> 32:30.040]  And then in places where there's, there's no legal access, you got to me, if you have
[32:30.040 --> 32:34.200]  to grow your own and make your own, you fucking will because people want to get high.
[32:34.200 --> 32:36.880]  They're going to do what they have to get high to get medicated.
[32:36.880 --> 32:37.880]  They're going to do that.
[32:37.880 --> 32:40.400]  And if it's not available, they're going to figure out a way.
[32:40.400 --> 32:43.320]  And since they just grew some shitty weed because they can't get the products to go
[32:43.320 --> 32:45.320]  to proper weed, now they got to do something with it.
[32:45.320 --> 32:49.100]  So let's just go get some butane, run it through some cans and blow up the house and make this
[32:49.100 --> 32:50.100]  look even worse.
[32:50.100 --> 32:54.680]  So the more legalized it is, the more likely you are to screw up the safety precautions
[32:54.680 --> 32:55.680]  you need to take.
[32:55.680 --> 32:58.840]  If, if it's just legal, then you can just go to the store and get it on the shelf in
[32:58.840 --> 32:59.840]  Colorado.
[32:59.840 --> 33:02.520]  You can go, I can think of four places I can go right now.
[33:02.520 --> 33:07.640]  I've never made it for 20, 25, 35 a gram for good fire.
[33:07.680 --> 33:08.680]  Yep.
[33:08.680 --> 33:09.680]  Yep.
[33:09.680 --> 33:11.160]  And there's no reason to risk blowing your house up.
[33:11.160 --> 33:12.600]  I'm going to keep reading this article.
[33:12.600 --> 33:15.360]  I feel like we've gotten through the gist of the article, but I'm going to keep reading
[33:15.360 --> 33:17.120]  it anyway, just because it feels like there's more.
[33:17.120 --> 33:18.880]  It says a knowledge problem.
[33:18.880 --> 33:23.260]  A lot of eyes widened when I talked to people who weren't aware of Colorado's new standards.
[33:23.260 --> 33:26.920]  Some consumers believe that industrial solvents are inherently hazardous to their health and
[33:26.920 --> 33:29.760]  should be avoided at virtually any level.
[33:29.760 --> 33:34.600]  Many concentrate consumers now opt for solventless extracts such as Rosin or bubble hash.
[33:34.600 --> 33:38.360]  Others don't worry as much pointing out, uh, then it says accurately, according to
[33:38.360 --> 33:42.600]  most scientists I talked to that someone who smells a whiff of butane from a Bic lighter
[33:42.600 --> 33:47.840]  has already inhaled way more than they'll get in a day of dabbing.
[33:47.840 --> 33:49.920]  That's a great, a great comparison.
[33:49.920 --> 33:50.920]  I like that.
[33:50.920 --> 33:55.080]  Well, he's sitting there talking about tasting it in the hash at 5,000 PPM.
[33:55.080 --> 33:58.200]  And I'm sitting there thinking about refilling my torch.
[33:58.200 --> 34:02.560]  And when your torch gets full and you get that little blowback, I guarantee you you're
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.260]  at way more than 5,000 PPM of butane in the air around your head.
[34:07.260 --> 34:10.000]  In that moment as it's, it's blasted out excess.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.400]  I mean, I'm sure it dissipates quickly, but I don't taste butane then.
[34:15.400 --> 34:19.880]  And I haven't just forced that through a several hundred degree now.
[34:19.880 --> 34:20.880]  Right.
[34:20.880 --> 34:21.880]  I agree with that.
[34:21.880 --> 34:22.880]  Like there's.
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.260]  Well, this guy, this guy goes on to say it's not the butane said Nick Mosley, co-owner
[34:27.260 --> 34:32.420]  and chief science officer at confidence, confidence analytics, a cannabis testing
[34:32.420 --> 34:34.220]  laboratory in Washington state.
[34:34.220 --> 34:36.460]  The butane is really not a huge health risk.
[34:36.460 --> 34:40.860]  He said, adding that it takes quite a bit, way more than you'd get from dabbing or a
[34:40.860 --> 34:44.600]  vape pen to cause serious harm such as liver damage.
[34:44.600 --> 34:49.100]  And then there's a 1990, a 1981 case study cited by the U S department of health and
[34:49.100 --> 34:55.460]  human services found that exposure to 10,000 PPMs for 10 minutes may lead to drowsiness,
[34:55.460 --> 34:58.740]  but doesn't appear to cause systemic effects in humans.
[34:58.740 --> 35:05.540]  The average dab consists of about 10 milligrams to 20 milligrams of concentrate.
[35:05.540 --> 35:10.820]  Mostly at confidence analytics said, and in the eyes of Colorado regulators, he added
[35:10.820 --> 35:15.860]  there these class three solvents are not cause for concern at 5,000 PPMs.
[35:15.860 --> 35:21.140]  When the dose of the substance is so low, then they go on to say mostly did call the
[35:21.140 --> 35:24.580]  levels of xylene and benzene in Colorado concerning.
[35:24.580 --> 35:29.820]  The issue with xylenes and benzene, he explained is that the contaminants are unintentionally
[35:29.820 --> 35:30.820]  there.
[35:30.820 --> 35:33.860]  In other words, those chemicals aren't part of the extraction process.
[35:33.860 --> 35:38.580]  Those chemicals are sometimes used to clean equipment and may inadvertently become part
[35:38.580 --> 35:40.140]  of the final product.
[35:40.140 --> 35:41.140]  See that shit that sucks.
[35:41.140 --> 35:42.660]  I don't like that.
[35:42.660 --> 35:45.180]  They're also sometimes found in low quality solvents.
[35:45.180 --> 35:46.180]  Okay.
[35:46.180 --> 35:49.660]  So if you don't distill your butane properly, in other words, their contaminants in the
[35:49.660 --> 35:54.260]  contaminant, mostly wasn't there are contaminants in the contaminant.
[35:54.940 --> 35:58.260]  He wasn't trying to consider to criticize Colorado's new limits from a health perspective,
[35:58.260 --> 36:02.700]  though he didn't sound especially jazzed about the idea of finding those residual levels
[36:02.700 --> 36:04.500]  in a concentrate either.
[36:04.500 --> 36:08.420]  It just meant that a higher, but soon to be illegal level of residuals could indicate
[36:08.420 --> 36:12.340]  careless extraction methods or low quality products.
[36:12.340 --> 36:16.140]  And see, that's what a lot of people's concern is going to be that this is going to make
[36:16.140 --> 36:17.140]  extractors lazy.
[36:17.140 --> 36:19.660]  Oh, I don't have to take all this out.
[36:19.660 --> 36:23.020]  Let's hurry up and get this out of the back of, and so we can get the next batch in the
[36:23.020 --> 36:25.180]  back of it because this is going to pass lab tests.
[36:25.180 --> 36:28.500]  This is going to be able to go on the shelf.
[36:28.500 --> 36:33.140]  The limits were drastically increased, but they were still drastically increased to a
[36:33.140 --> 36:38.700]  number so small that it's unnoticeable.
[36:38.700 --> 36:40.580]  It's a super tiny amount.
[36:40.580 --> 36:45.980]  And when you think about all the other testing and stuff that goes into it, this is a conversation
[36:45.980 --> 36:50.580]  we're only able to have because it's insanely legal here.
[36:51.140 --> 37:00.020]  Statewide, we have access to product unmatched anywhere in the US as far as testing and labeling
[37:00.020 --> 37:01.820]  goes.
[37:01.820 --> 37:06.100]  We know more about the product we're consuming than anyone on the planet.
[37:06.100 --> 37:11.140]  And going through these rulemaking hearings is part of that.
[37:11.140 --> 37:14.380]  These are the limits for anything else on the market.
[37:14.380 --> 37:20.340]  I'm not encouraging extractors to push the envelope of the upper limits that are allowed
[37:20.380 --> 37:22.740]  now.
[37:22.740 --> 37:28.900]  But if these are allowed for any other product I buy at a store or a pharmacy, I don't see
[37:28.900 --> 37:32.780]  why they shouldn't be allowed for my hash either.
[37:32.780 --> 37:38.780]  But I also understand the movement away from solvent-made hash.
[37:38.780 --> 37:43.660]  I get the people that are looking for high-grade water extract.
[37:43.660 --> 37:45.500]  A lot of people are on that rosin train.
[37:45.500 --> 37:46.500]  Yeah.
[37:46.500 --> 37:47.500]  A lot of people love rosin.
[37:47.660 --> 37:51.180]  A lot of people are haters of BHO.
[37:51.180 --> 37:52.180]  I get it.
[37:52.180 --> 38:00.060]  A big part of the marijuana community came here fleeing the pharmaceutical industry for
[38:00.060 --> 38:02.260]  one reason or another.
[38:02.260 --> 38:14.200]  And the idea of their marijuana industry moving towards that model in any way is scary.
[38:14.200 --> 38:18.840]  Moving away from natural in any way is scary to them.
[38:18.840 --> 38:27.200]  I hate to be the one to point out that their flowers in the BHO hash are almost identical
[38:27.200 --> 38:34.680]  in every way except for a little bit of solvent used in the extract.
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.840]  Everything that's in that flower is going to be in that extract, including all the bad
[38:38.840 --> 38:40.960]  shit that's already in your flower.
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.480]  Just because it's a plant doesn't mean it's good for you or natural in the end?
[38:45.480 --> 38:50.040]  For a little bit, a lot of people were under the impression that the clear and distillate
[38:50.040 --> 38:51.560]  was removing solvents.
[38:51.560 --> 38:55.720]  But we have recently discovered that that is not true.
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.920]  You have to use a separate filter to get out pesticides and solvents from the clear.
[39:00.920 --> 39:03.240]  It's getting rid of the solvents because we're heating it high enough.
[39:03.240 --> 39:05.040]  It's the pesticides that we're not getting out.
[39:05.040 --> 39:07.280]  I said that wrong probably because I took too many dabs.
[39:07.280 --> 39:14.200]  There were a lot of rumors about the clear and 99% of them were just bullshit.
[39:14.200 --> 39:15.920]  But I do love some well-made distillate.
[39:15.920 --> 39:16.920]  Oh my gosh.
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.880]  I've had some amazing distillate, but I don't at all understand the hype for the clear.
[39:22.880 --> 39:29.760]  I know people that are obsessed with the clear that rant and rave about it because of the
[39:29.760 --> 39:32.440]  hype and not because of its actual properties.
[39:32.440 --> 39:38.840]  I would prefer my distillate to come without terps and let me put my own terps in there.
[39:38.840 --> 39:39.840]  That's the way I would prefer it.
[39:39.840 --> 39:40.840]  I see.
[39:40.840 --> 39:47.440]  One of the things I really like in my hash, the reason I'm such a live resin fanatic is
[39:47.440 --> 39:48.440]  that flavor.
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.720]  It's all already there.
[39:49.720 --> 39:51.760]  I just scoop and glob.
[39:51.760 --> 39:52.760]  Yeah.
[39:52.760 --> 39:53.760]  I glob.
[39:53.760 --> 39:54.760]  Teeny glob.
[39:54.760 --> 39:55.760]  Yeah.
[39:55.760 --> 39:58.680]  I was going to let you have it.
[39:59.000 --> 40:08.480]  But the actual taking a distillate, dunking it, that's fun for me, but I don't want to
[40:08.480 --> 40:09.480]  build it.
[40:09.480 --> 40:12.040]  I just want to enjoy it.
[40:12.040 --> 40:20.240]  One of the things I love about cannabis is the huge flavor profile variety.
[40:20.240 --> 40:24.440]  It's more fun to me to taste what that flower was supposed to taste like than going to the
[40:24.440 --> 40:28.840]  soda factory and having them do 25 different syrups.
[40:28.840 --> 40:30.400]  To create that soda flavor.
[40:30.400 --> 40:31.400]  Right.
[40:31.400 --> 40:32.400]  Yeah.
[40:32.400 --> 40:33.400]  I get you.
[40:33.400 --> 40:34.400]  Okay.
[40:34.400 --> 40:35.400]  I just like when you can take some distillate.
[40:35.400 --> 40:38.520]  I feel like they overdo it when they go mixing the terps in on their own when they sell me
[40:38.520 --> 40:39.520]  the distillate.
[40:39.520 --> 40:40.560]  It's overdone.
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.360]  Every distillate I've had that has terpenes reintroduced has way overdone it.
[40:45.360 --> 40:46.360]  Yeah.
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.840]  I'd rather just be able to do it myself and then I can buy a bottle of distillate and
[40:49.840 --> 40:53.680]  three or four vials of terps and mix and match and make it the way I want.
[40:53.920 --> 40:57.040]  Then when I run out of that distillate, I just put the terps right on my shatter.
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.640]  I've been getting little tiny pipettes and just dipping it right onto the shatter.
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.920]  I do believe that the terpenoids contribute heavily to my high because I can dab the same
[41:06.920 --> 41:11.200]  shatter and put different terps on it and you'd get different effects.
[41:11.200 --> 41:19.760]  You tease the future show about lab testing and how it's changed some things.
[41:19.760 --> 41:27.760]  It's definitely helped us lose focus on the variety of compounds in the plant that influence
[41:27.760 --> 41:34.160]  the high, the experience, the medical effect.
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.080]  I can't wait for that show for these reasons exactly.
[41:37.080 --> 41:42.320]  There's so many different parts of the cannabis plant that influence its effect on you.
[41:42.320 --> 41:43.960]  I think you're exactly right.
[41:43.960 --> 41:48.600]  Terpenes are a huge portion of the medical effect and the high.
[41:48.600 --> 41:52.560]  You can feel it with that 100% distillate when you go from a ghost-trained haze terps
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.160]  to an OG Kush terps that you're dunking it in.
[41:56.160 --> 41:57.720]  You can feel the high difference.
[41:57.720 --> 42:01.720]  It's the exact same THC, the exact same.
[42:01.720 --> 42:05.520]  When you add in the other stuff that doesn't affect the high, it's the non-psychoactive
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.400]  stuff that doesn't scare people.
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.680]  That's a Final Fantasy VII joke.
[42:14.680 --> 42:16.280]  It completely changes the high.
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.040]  I was blown away the first time I experienced it.
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.400]  It's all about the other pieces.
[42:25.400 --> 42:29.080]  It's all about that entourage slash synergistic effect, however you want to call it.
[42:29.080 --> 42:31.440]  I love the term entourage effect.
[42:31.440 --> 42:34.280]  It's so descriptive.
[42:34.280 --> 42:35.280]  It's true.
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.360]  Like you said, when I smoke these, where did I put it?
[42:38.360 --> 42:40.480]  These ghost-trained haze terps right here?
[42:40.480 --> 42:44.080]  This is like a bottle rocket on your dab.
[42:44.080 --> 42:46.000]  You take your dab and you're like, oh, I'm high from my dab.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.480]  Then a second later, you're like, I keep getting higher.
[42:49.480 --> 42:51.880]  Is this ever going to fucking stop?
[42:51.880 --> 42:56.360]  If you put the same dab and take some of that OG Kush like you were talking about, you go,
[42:56.360 --> 42:59.120]  I'm going to get slow for a minute.
[42:59.120 --> 43:01.040]  You want to drool on yourself for a couple seconds.
[43:01.040 --> 43:05.520]  If you take the, I think it's called Paradigium, you take that one, I get hyper from it.
[43:05.520 --> 43:08.880]  I'm like, woo, with all that, I want to go run around now.
[43:08.880 --> 43:12.080]  They all have, there's something in those terpenoids that's doing something completely
[43:12.080 --> 43:15.480]  different to your body and to your mind.
[43:15.480 --> 43:20.480]  It just releases different chemicals, triggers different things.
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.040]  But yeah, lab testing has changed.
[43:24.040 --> 43:26.800]  What we look for is consumers.
[43:26.800 --> 43:29.640]  That's drastically changing the consumption experience.
[43:29.640 --> 43:30.640]  Absolutely.
[43:30.640 --> 43:36.400]  Well, I hope that allowing more PPMs in our concentrates does not encourage hashmakers
[43:36.400 --> 43:38.080]  to lazy up.
[43:38.080 --> 43:40.680]  We're getting really good at concentrate making here in Colorado.
[43:40.680 --> 43:43.320]  I hope that people just keep getting better.
[43:43.320 --> 43:49.000]  Shout out to the people that are encouraging and learning and making better hash.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.880]  I don't think anybody was really excited about this as far as, yay, now we can shave 45 seconds
[43:54.880 --> 43:56.400]  off our back oven cook.
[43:56.400 --> 44:00.400]  You know, when I first heard about this happening, I was like, oh, what the fuck is happening?
[44:00.400 --> 44:03.520]  But now that I've read the article, I think I understand a little more and I'm not as
[44:03.520 --> 44:06.080]  nervous or paranoid about the increase.
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.880]  If there's ever a BHL where I can taste butane in it, you can guarantee that that hash is
[44:10.880 --> 44:12.200]  going away.
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.240]  I was a little worried when it was only Leafly was kind of reporting this.
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.240]  And I was happy to see the level of reporting they did.
[44:21.240 --> 44:27.480]  But because they're not a hardcore news org, you see that wander a little bit.
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.020]  The guy, I'm guessing he just said it is something dumb during the interview.
[44:32.020 --> 44:33.020]  And I've been interviewed a lot.
[44:33.020 --> 44:34.760]  I know sometimes stupid shit slips out.
[44:34.760 --> 44:36.480]  I say plenty of shit on this podcast.
[44:36.480 --> 44:43.800]  A good reporter will skip over the brain fart that you uttered on the record and stick to
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.600]  the on-topic point.
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.080]  And this reporter got hung up on the, we might be talking about levels that consumers could
[44:50.080 --> 44:51.080]  smell or taste.
[44:51.080 --> 44:56.340]  And then he goes on to say how these levels are perfectly allowed in pharmaceutical products.
[44:56.340 --> 45:03.340]  If you can allow 5,000 ppm of butane in an Buterol inhaler, have a Buterol inhaler people
[45:03.380 --> 45:07.520]  with that level of people have they reported the taste?
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.100]  That would be part of the study that he's citing for the increase and it's not.
[45:12.100 --> 45:19.100]  But because he mentioned that to a reporter who's not obsessed with keeping the story
[45:20.640 --> 45:25.980]  clean and factual and got hung up on something dumb, the guy said at the beginning.
[45:25.980 --> 45:29.620]  And now half of people that read that story are like, man, I'm not buying Hash Colorado
[45:29.620 --> 45:30.620]  anymore to see Butane.
[45:31.060 --> 45:32.060]  You guys, you will know.
[45:32.060 --> 45:33.460]  And there are going to be lab tests.
[45:33.460 --> 45:34.460]  Can I see your container?
[45:34.460 --> 45:36.860]  You've got there the Panama East Coast, Panama.
[45:36.860 --> 45:39.260]  It's got the lab testing real well on here.
[45:39.260 --> 45:45.140]  This is some this is from Turpex and it is East Coast, Panama chunk wax.
[45:45.140 --> 45:46.660]  It's labeled a hybrid.
[45:46.660 --> 45:52.800]  The next numbers listed on here are the MIP, which is the marijuana infused product license.
[45:52.800 --> 45:55.280]  It's got the license number of who made the hash.
[45:55.280 --> 45:59.180]  It's got the OPC number, which is the optional premises cultivation center.
[45:59.540 --> 46:01.100]  And it's got their ID number.
[46:01.100 --> 46:02.100]  That's where it was grown.
[46:02.100 --> 46:07.460]  Then it's got a batch number so that we know which batch of plants went into this mix.
[46:07.460 --> 46:11.980]  By researching the batch number, we can tell you what plant tags were in here, which is
[46:11.980 --> 46:15.940]  each individual plant, which if they did it, that's how they track.
[46:15.940 --> 46:18.340]  Like those are the numbers they use to do recall track.
[46:18.340 --> 46:19.340]  Every Colorado.
[46:19.340 --> 46:21.780]  We can tell you if that plant has been applied a pesticide.
[46:21.780 --> 46:25.420]  We can tell you everything that plant has been sprayed with fed.
[46:25.420 --> 46:28.820]  We can tell you the date it was cut as a clone, the day it was moved into flower.
[46:29.140 --> 46:32.660]  We can tell you everything about mostly everything that about that plant, if it were properly
[46:32.660 --> 46:36.740]  documented by the grower and the metric supervisor at that facility.
[46:36.740 --> 46:41.140]  A lot of times she tries to pass through testing results or what's going to reveal the truth.
[46:41.140 --> 46:43.500]  So I'm looking at this container and it's got test results on it.
[46:43.500 --> 46:52.380]  It shows me how much CBGA, CBG, CBD, a CBD, THC, a THC and total cannabinoids are on here.
[46:52.380 --> 46:56.500]  Now I assume that in the very near future, they're going to include these particles per
[46:56.500 --> 46:58.040]  million testing on here.
[46:58.640 --> 47:02.560]  Those part of these rule changes were labeling changes.
[47:02.560 --> 47:06.640]  That product is this an old, that's an old product.
[47:06.640 --> 47:08.840]  Most of the hash I've got is a couple of months old now.
[47:08.840 --> 47:10.240]  You kind of hold the hash for a minute.
[47:10.240 --> 47:11.240]  I do.
[47:11.240 --> 47:16.680]  I love stockpiling so that I can hit, you know, every time I go to dab, I've got 35
[47:16.680 --> 47:17.680]  different flavors to choose from.
[47:17.680 --> 47:18.680]  It's pretty awesome.
[47:18.680 --> 47:20.600]  It takes some planning.
[47:20.600 --> 47:26.360]  And every now and then I realized that I've had a hash container for a year, 14 months.
[47:26.360 --> 47:30.240]  And then I make a point to smoke it all real quick so that it doesn't convert any further.
[47:30.240 --> 47:31.520]  If you need some help, let me know.
[47:31.520 --> 47:32.520]  I'm happy to.
[47:32.520 --> 47:33.960]  I can take dabs.
[47:33.960 --> 47:39.760]  Old high THC stuff that's had some aging to it is really good on inflammation and pain.
[47:39.760 --> 47:41.240]  It converts into some other fun stuff.
[47:41.240 --> 47:42.240]  It's really good on inflammation and pain.
[47:42.240 --> 47:43.720]  Yeah, it decarboxylates a little bit.
[47:43.720 --> 47:47.840]  It loses a decarboxyl group.
[47:47.840 --> 47:51.120]  It's a reason to stash and a reason not to worry if it gets a little old.
[47:51.120 --> 47:54.280]  But yeah, I'm a hoarder.
[47:54.280 --> 47:58.640]  But this labeling isn't up to par and it's still better than 99% of the legal marijuana
[47:58.640 --> 48:01.440]  products you're going to find sold in the US.
[48:01.440 --> 48:02.440]  Yes.
[48:02.440 --> 48:04.320]  Same thing with this other hash container I've bought.
[48:04.320 --> 48:08.920]  I've worn this label down a little bit, but totally different container, totally different
[48:08.920 --> 48:11.880]  shape, totally different company, exact same information.
[48:11.880 --> 48:12.880]  Yeah.
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.400]  And this one, if you look closely, you can see that the butane PPMs are listed on this
[48:16.400 --> 48:17.400]  label.
[48:17.400 --> 48:18.400]  Oh, nice.
[48:18.400 --> 48:19.400]  Can you read it still?
[48:19.400 --> 48:20.400]  No.
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.520]  I can read that it used to be there.
[48:23.760 --> 48:30.560]  And actually, I believe it's triple zeros for both of the butane and whatever that next
[48:30.560 --> 48:31.560]  butane was.
[48:31.560 --> 48:32.560]  Nice.
[48:32.560 --> 48:33.560]  Pentane.
[48:33.560 --> 48:34.560]  Yeah.
[48:34.560 --> 48:35.560]  And I see propane.
[48:35.560 --> 48:37.560]  There was actually 2.75 left.
[48:37.560 --> 48:38.560]  Okay.
[48:38.560 --> 48:40.280]  That's not much.
[48:40.280 --> 48:43.600]  Not much at all, but it's for some live resin, so that's to be a little bit expected.
[48:43.600 --> 48:45.680]  There's going to be a little bit of residual solvent left in there.
[48:45.680 --> 48:48.200]  It's got a lot of moisture going on, so it'll hold on to some stuff.
[48:48.200 --> 48:49.200]  It looks good.
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.040]  It's a real, real...
[48:52.040 --> 48:53.040]  It's almost like...
[48:53.040 --> 48:55.520]  It looks like sugary butter.
[48:55.520 --> 48:56.520]  Play-Doh sand.
[48:56.520 --> 49:03.360]  I don't know if you ever did the thing with water and cornstarch.
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.200]  But if you ever scratched your fingernail and scratched some of that out of there, it's
[49:07.200 --> 49:08.600]  about that consistency to work with.
[49:08.600 --> 49:12.240]  I would totally dab that stuff by the looks of it.
[49:12.240 --> 49:13.240]  I love this company.
[49:13.240 --> 49:15.440]  I don't really want to shout them out because we've done a lot of shout outs on this show,
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.240]  but they make some awesome live resin and I drive really far to get it.
[49:19.440 --> 49:21.440]  See, that's...
[49:21.440 --> 49:24.440]  Sometimes in Colorado, people are like, but there are stores everywhere.
[49:24.440 --> 49:26.840]  Yeah, but I drive up to Denver to this one place for this product.
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.320]  I drive from West Pueblo, not Pueblo West, but the West side of Pueblo to the very far
[49:32.320 --> 49:34.440]  north end of Denver.
[49:34.440 --> 49:36.160]  It's like 126 miles.
[49:36.160 --> 49:42.160]  I drive past at least 300 marijuana stores to go to the one with the product I like.
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.440]  Yeah, and I do and have done and will do the same thing in the future.
[49:46.640 --> 49:50.040]  There are two or three dispensaries in Denver that I like to really shop at.
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.040]  Yep.
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.040]  Yep.
[49:52.040 --> 49:53.040]  All right, so you guys, don't worry about it.
[49:53.040 --> 49:54.160]  It's not going to be that big of a deal.
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.880]  If you come to Colorado to buy some concentrates and you get these high numbers, you're going
[49:57.880 --> 49:59.280]  to notice if something's wrong.
[49:59.280 --> 50:02.520]  Don't let the PPM numbers freak you out.
[50:02.520 --> 50:08.160]  If you're buying Shatter and it shatters, you don't have to worry about residual butane.
[50:08.160 --> 50:09.400]  You're probably doing all right.
[50:09.400 --> 50:14.200]  If it's on the shelf and they've got it, it's a store, you're probably doing okay because
[50:14.200 --> 50:16.360]  they'll get concentrates that shit won't sell.
[50:16.360 --> 50:17.360]  It'll go on sale.
[50:17.360 --> 50:18.560]  They'll get rid of it the first time.
[50:18.560 --> 50:20.360]  They'll never buy it again.
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.320]  The employees are customers as well most of the time.
[50:25.320 --> 50:29.640]  I mean, as a consumer that doesn't really know a whole lot, the one thing you want to
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.600]  look out for is if you go to a shop and they go, I mean, just for example, this is 50,
[50:34.600 --> 50:37.120]  this is 55, this is 65.
[50:37.120 --> 50:40.440]  Oh, and we have these for $19.99.
[50:40.440 --> 50:43.360]  Be wary of the $19.99.
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.240]  There's a reason that there's that big, big discount for that one particular thing.
[50:48.240 --> 50:49.240]  It might be old.
[50:49.240 --> 50:52.960]  It might be about to pass out.
[50:52.960 --> 50:59.080]  A friend of mine had to throw out a whole bunch of product at his store because labels
[50:59.080 --> 51:02.400]  expired and you can't just slap on a new label.
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.860]  That's terrible.
[51:05.860 --> 51:10.640]  When that date's getting close, you'll watch it go from full price to half price to exactly
[51:10.640 --> 51:15.040]  what the shop paid for it to half of what the shop paid for it to please God, let me
[51:15.040 --> 51:21.800]  get any of my money back on it before the first or whatever hits.
[51:21.800 --> 51:26.080]  Sometimes as a consumer, that can be real helpful and sometimes that just means that's
[51:26.080 --> 51:27.880]  the crap that they got tricked into buying.
[51:27.880 --> 51:29.440]  I just took a gnarly dab.
[51:29.440 --> 51:30.440]  Yeah, you did.
[51:30.440 --> 51:31.440]  That was good.
[51:31.440 --> 51:32.440]  The whole room just fogged up.
[51:32.440 --> 51:33.920]  I think I got half a dab off your dab.
[51:33.920 --> 51:37.200]  One thing I want to mention is something I've experienced in Colorado and I'm going to quit
[51:37.200 --> 51:38.200]  talking funny here in just a second.
[51:38.200 --> 51:41.440]  I feel like I'm going to sneeze and cough.
[51:41.440 --> 51:46.800]  Something that happens, an extraction company, and we're just going to say that Mike and
[51:46.800 --> 51:48.000]  I have an extraction company.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.240]  Jeff and Mike's extraction company, we make extracts.
[51:51.240 --> 51:52.320]  That's our specialty.
[51:52.320 --> 52:00.080]  What we do is we go to dispensaries that have a grow involved in their business plan.
[52:00.080 --> 52:03.960]  There's a dispensary with a grow that grows product and that product goes to the dispensary
[52:03.960 --> 52:04.960]  for sale.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.120]  What we offer to do as an extraction company is we will take either your buds or your trim.
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.720]  Whatever material you want to give us.
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.400]  We would gladly turn it into product for you for a price.
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.520]  There is usually, I don't know how much insider info I should give, but there's usually a
[52:20.520 --> 52:21.520]  deal worked out to where-
[52:21.520 --> 52:22.960]  There's an industry range.
[52:22.960 --> 52:26.440]  I run it, we run it as a company, and we split it with you 50-50.
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.240]  Then we get half of the product that's done, we package it and everything.
[52:30.720 --> 52:37.280]  We deliver your portion back to the store and you put it on the shelf for sale.
[52:37.280 --> 52:43.120]  The other way to do it is we run it and we sell it back to your dispensary at a price.
[52:43.120 --> 52:47.680]  Those prices vary widely depending on the company and the deals that you work out and
[52:47.680 --> 52:49.240]  how much product you're running.
[52:49.240 --> 52:53.160]  The quality of the product, the final product consistency.
[52:53.160 --> 52:56.960]  The popularity of the companies.
[52:56.960 --> 53:02.360]  If you're one of the top known grows and one of the top known extract companies, they'll
[53:02.360 --> 53:07.680]  run the shit for damn near free for each other so that they can both say, ran by these companies
[53:07.680 --> 53:09.560]  and they both make a ton of fucking money off of it.
[53:09.560 --> 53:18.480]  You'll usually see a pretty tight range in hash pricing at the shop.
[53:18.480 --> 53:21.880]  It'll be like a $10 or $15 window.
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.920]  The cheapest one in that window is usually a company you've never heard of.
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.440]  That doesn't mean anything other than they're new and or small.
[53:30.440 --> 53:36.360]  A good example of them, of that company, of that range is a company called Extracts Inc.
[53:36.360 --> 53:41.140]  They are not known, but I think lately they have been kicking out some ridiculously good
[53:41.140 --> 53:44.320]  concentrates at a very low price.
[53:44.320 --> 53:45.840]  Their packaging is plain.
[53:45.840 --> 53:50.880]  They don't have any advertising, but the shit is good once you crack that package open.
[53:50.880 --> 53:57.960]  I've seen a half dozen new extract companies that I've never heard of before where the
[53:57.960 --> 54:00.760]  first product I see from them is stellar.
[54:00.760 --> 54:02.080]  Incredibles.
[54:02.080 --> 54:04.000]  I had no idea that they were doing hash.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.560]  They make some of the best.
[54:05.560 --> 54:09.360]  The first time I saw it, it was actually granny that had it.
[54:09.360 --> 54:13.720]  She opened it up and I was like, holy shit.
[54:13.720 --> 54:20.680]  There's a company down here that used to come into the shop I was working at all the time.
[54:21.400 --> 54:23.080]  That's brand new and just getting on their feet.
[54:23.080 --> 54:28.200]  I've seen some really nice stuff from them lately.
[54:28.200 --> 54:31.680]  It's nice to see this much quality coming on the market.
[54:31.680 --> 54:37.640]  Where I was headed with all of this is, if you buy an extract from an extract company,
[54:37.640 --> 54:39.440]  say you get something, what do we name our company?
[54:39.440 --> 54:41.640]  I gave us a name, but Mike and Jeff's Extracts.
[54:41.640 --> 54:43.640]  Whatever the fuck I called this earlier.
[54:43.640 --> 54:48.840]  If you buy a pro, we are running material grown by other dispensaries.
[54:48.840 --> 54:54.520]  If we buy some material from Maggie's Farm and run it, it's going to come out brown and
[54:54.520 --> 54:55.520]  janky.
[54:55.520 --> 54:56.520]  It always does.
[54:56.520 --> 55:00.760]  I've seen several extract companies run Maggie's Farm stuff.
[55:00.760 --> 55:01.760]  It's not quality.
[55:01.760 --> 55:02.920]  Something about their grow.
[55:02.920 --> 55:05.760]  I think they trim with a trim machine, which will fuck up your extract.
[55:05.760 --> 55:08.680]  I think they're using old material, which will fuck up your extract.
[55:08.680 --> 55:10.760]  Their stuff never comes out good.
[55:10.760 --> 55:11.760]  If you run stuff from Kind Love.
[55:11.760 --> 55:15.760]  There's a million different things that go into a grow that will fuck up the extract.
[55:15.920 --> 55:22.160]  If you run material from Kind Love, it always comes back fire.
[55:22.160 --> 55:27.440]  A good portion of the hash work is up to the company that's running your extract.
[55:27.440 --> 55:32.120]  A large portion of it is up to whoever grew that material, how long the material sat around,
[55:32.120 --> 55:34.880]  how it was stored, how it was trimmed.
[55:34.880 --> 55:37.040]  That is a huge factor.
[55:37.040 --> 55:43.080]  If you buy some extracts from a hash company, if you buy some Mike and Jeff Extracts, and
[55:43.080 --> 55:47.560]  it's shitty one time and amazing one time, you kind of got to keep in mind to go look
[55:47.560 --> 55:54.160]  at this little OPC and MIP tag on here and see what the OPC number is, because that will
[55:54.160 --> 55:55.760]  tell you who grew it.
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.800]  It varies wildly batch to batch with some companies.
[55:59.800 --> 56:05.000]  Other companies that are a little more established, I see less variety in what they're putting
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.520]  on shelves.
[56:07.520 --> 56:17.120]  For a while, like a year and a half ago, you would see A+, F+.
[56:17.120 --> 56:18.120]  In the same ship—
[56:18.120 --> 56:21.600]  It's like the products will be really, really good for a little while, and then one guy
[56:21.600 --> 56:25.480]  will quit, and everything just falls apart until they re-figure it out with the new hash
[56:25.480 --> 56:26.480]  maker.
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.840]  The other side of that coin is, if you go to a shop and you see a strain you like, and
[56:30.840 --> 56:35.880]  you take a look at the hash, and it's a quality that looks good to you, and you take it home
[56:35.880 --> 56:42.400]  and you hate it and you love it, and you want more, go back and get more right away.
[56:42.400 --> 56:48.160]  Because just the nature of the industry, extract companies buy what's available.
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.600]  There's no guarantee that that strain is going to be made available to that extract company
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.600]  again.
[56:54.600 --> 56:55.600]  Or that blend.
[56:55.600 --> 56:59.200]  If it does, then it'll be that quality.
[56:59.200 --> 57:05.160]  That same artist or team of people will be doing the extraction in the same way.
[57:05.200 --> 57:09.200]  A lot of times, that'll be a blend of flowers.
[57:09.200 --> 57:12.600]  The extractors will take a minimum of usually 1,000 grams to run.
[57:12.600 --> 57:14.240]  They don't want less than 1,000 grams.
[57:14.240 --> 57:16.400]  That's what fits in their column.
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.840]  You don't always have a— If you had 1,000 grams of something, it would be buds, and
[57:20.840 --> 57:22.960]  it wouldn't be a bunch of fucking shake to run.
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.920]  It wouldn't even happen.
[57:24.920 --> 57:26.680]  Maybe they're putting— What is this?
[57:26.680 --> 57:27.680]  You got East Coast, pineapple.
[57:27.680 --> 57:29.440]  No, that's a real strain.
[57:29.440 --> 57:31.160]  Maybe you got some Blue Dream and some Golden Goat.
[57:31.160 --> 57:38.360]  You see it all the time when it sounds like two names squished together on the hash container.
[57:38.360 --> 57:39.360]  That's almost always what it is.
[57:39.360 --> 57:41.720]  All right, we've been going for an hour, but you just put me on something that I want to
[57:41.720 --> 57:42.720]  bitch about.
[57:42.720 --> 57:44.200]  I hate it when extract companies do that.
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.240]  It bothers me.
[57:45.240 --> 57:49.280]  As a medical product, we don't need extract companies creating fucking names out of their
[57:49.280 --> 57:50.280]  hash blends.
[57:50.280 --> 57:53.000]  I have the same issue with growers.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.360]  Give it a minute, stabilize it, then rename it.
[57:57.360 --> 57:58.720]  It's a renaming thing.
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.480]  It sucks.
[58:00.800 --> 58:02.240]  Here's something that I find important.
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.360]  There are strains that are well-known.
[58:04.360 --> 58:06.600]  Certain people rely on certain strains.
[58:06.600 --> 58:08.000]  I don't know what strain.
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.560]  Grateful Dog works well for you.
[58:09.560 --> 58:14.680]  I've got a blue headband, and I have no fucking clue what that blue is from.
[58:14.680 --> 58:19.040]  It's probably Blueberry or Blue Dream, but you don't know, right?
[58:19.040 --> 58:22.880]  I would much prefer if the whole blend was labeled out.
[58:22.880 --> 58:29.120]  Yeah, I wish that extract company would have put Blue Dream and Blue or Headband so that
[58:29.200 --> 58:32.880]  we know what you're smoking, because if that works wonderfully for you, we can go find
[58:32.880 --> 58:37.680]  more Blueberry or Blue Dream and more headband for you.
[58:37.680 --> 58:42.160]  They're also creating confusion, because what if somebody does have blue headband?
[58:42.160 --> 58:46.440]  Is a real flower and a real cross that a breeder actually took their time to make?
[58:46.440 --> 58:47.440]  I think a breeder-
[58:47.440 --> 58:51.560]  The part that kills it for the consumer is, people are creatures of habit.
[58:51.560 --> 58:55.200]  They want to go to the store, and they want their fucking six-pack of Corona.
[58:55.200 --> 58:57.160]  They want the same thing when they go to the dispensary.
[58:57.160 --> 59:01.860]  They want to walk in and get their three favorite things, just like they do at every
[59:01.860 --> 59:03.680]  other store in their world.
[59:03.680 --> 59:09.520]  Unfortunately, when you walk into a marijuana store, it's, yeah, I understand that you really
[59:09.520 --> 59:12.720]  loved that Blue Dream you bought last week.
[59:12.720 --> 59:14.400]  It was a really good cut.
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.400]  It was real popular.
[59:15.400 --> 59:17.920]  We're out of that now.
[59:17.920 --> 59:21.160]  Here's where it falls in the range of genetics.
[59:21.160 --> 59:23.440]  Here's stuff that's similar.
[59:23.440 --> 59:26.040]  Good luck picking a new one.
[59:27.040 --> 59:31.480]  You can come back tomorrow and ask for more Blue Dream, and we ain't going to have it
[59:31.480 --> 59:32.480]  then either.
[59:32.480 --> 59:34.880]  But maybe in 54 days?
[59:34.880 --> 59:41.080]  Eventually, there will be more, but when that will be, and when it's stuff like hash, the
[59:41.080 --> 59:46.680]  store has almost no ability to call the extract company and be like, yeah, we need more sour
[59:46.680 --> 59:48.580]  diesel.
[59:48.580 --> 59:52.200]  There might be some sour diesel available that they're about to run for you.
[59:52.400 --> 59:58.280]  There might not be any offered to that extract company for years, unless they're growing
[59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.240]  the stuff they're processing, or unless the shop is selling the material to the extract
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.320]  company.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.920]  There's no way to guarantee that material is going to be there when it's time to re-up
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.240]  a shipment.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:16.520]  You're kind of forced to go find new stuff that you like, which is good and bad.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.440]  I like it because I like a big variety.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.320]  I get why it pisses so many people off.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.080]  There are some people that are very, in my opinion, it's too specific about their THC
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.120]  and cannabis needs.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.640]  I think that they're a little spoiled and they should just smoke some dope and relax.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.840]  But some people are like, I cannot smoke stuff with the word kush or this in it, or I cannot
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.840]  smoke heavy sativas.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.720]  As part of the evolutionary process, our brains are designed to remember stuff that we didn't
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.920]  like or that we perceived as hurtful.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.520]  When it's stuff like foods and intoxicants, we hold onto those memories for life.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.480]  Everybody's got that one alcoholic beverage that they got a hold of when they were 13,
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480]  14, 15.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:10.600]  Yeah, drank it like it was water and then threw up for a day and a half.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:16.920]  Now they can't even see sour apple pucker or banana red mad dog or whatever the fuck
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.520]  without getting a little nauseous.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.320]  You took that to a personal place, didn't you?
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:27.360]  No, it's actually, I doubt that person where those two references are there things would
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.920]  ever listen to the show, but on the off chance they do that laugh really hard when they hear
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]  that part.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.280]  But for me, it's Miller Lite.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280]  MGDs.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.120]  Shouldn't be drinking that piss anyway.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.360]  It was what was there when we were that age.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.280]  Me and a friend drank way too much of it.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.560]  He did the infamous puke fart and I was hung over for like five days and now even when
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.320]  I see the label, I throw up in my mouth a little bit and I used to have to go buy it
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.920]  for somebody in my life a lot.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.560]  And that was always a fun trip back from the store because I'm trying not to look at what's
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.960]  in the passenger seat because it's making me nauseous.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.360]  So I felt about rum.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.160]  Rum was not my thing.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.720]  It's the same thing with cannabis.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.440]  Somebody smokes way too much Kush one night and it's how much they consumed, how they
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.960]  consumed it doesn't have anything to do with the strain or that it was an indica.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.520]  But now every time they go to a dispensary, they make a big deal about how it can't be
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:26.360]  Kush to their bud tender or it can't say Durban in it that, you know, I smoked too much Durban
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.720]  the first time I came to Colorado and I was alone in my hotel room and I ate that whole
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.360]  that whole brownie and then I smoked that Durban poison and it was just too much.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360]  I don't want that Durban.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.720]  And it's like, dude, it was the 11 other cannabis products you made.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.880]  Didn't have nothing to do with what strain you picked.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.920]  But explaining that it's difficult.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.200]  And then when they get there and the one thing they found that they really like you're out
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.880]  of and they have to start the process all over again, like it can be kind of headachy.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.720]  I wish more people expected it.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.560]  Oh, the cannabis market.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.840]  We've got to regulate it a little bit better so that we've got the products that people
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.840]  want, but it's hard because you got to grow.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.200]  I have to remind myself how lucky we are here.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.280]  The good shit sells out.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.320]  That's how it goes.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.720]  It's a first world problem in the extreme.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:19.800]  Um, and we're so spoiled here with, uh, our marijuana markets in the, the vast of assortment
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.800]  of products that's available in that market.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.000]  Um, I mean, prices are coming down, quality's going up, uh, selections going up.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.520]  It's good for, we've got weed suppositories now.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.320]  You can take your weed and everywhere.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.400]  I put some weed pain cream on today before I left the house.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.280]  I gave both knees a coat before I started getting ready to come over for the show.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:48.000]  Um, we've got suppositories, we've got lozenges, we've got sprays, we've got pills, we've got
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.520]  flowers, we've got a hundred different kinds of hash now.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.000]  Um, when you go to this, when you went to a dispensary a year and a half ago, open was
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.720]  the only vape pen, um, on the shelf.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.080]  Now there are hundreds of vape pen companies in with hundreds of different qualities, hundreds
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.560]  of different strain options.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.800]  Um, I love that things are strain specific now too.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.800]  That's so great.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.800]  This strain specific edibles, strain specific vape pens.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]  That shit is so great.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.280]  Instead of just Indica, Sativa or hybrid, you can get actual specifics.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.320]  We move closer to the, the micro brew model every day.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.880]  Um, with the, the quality and the selection of products that we've got and it's absolutely
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.120]  wonderful.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:37.600]  And then I look at, uh, I mean just next door to us, most of the States that surround Colorado
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:45.040]  are still under full prohibition where my friends scored a handful of good herb or good
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040]  weed.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.720]  Like that's what they know about it is that their friends scored it and it's good.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720]  Yeah.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.880]  And that's the end of the information that they will ever have on it.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.440]  I don't miss those days when he'd go to get some weed and they had some weed and you got
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440]  whatever was there.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.440]  Yep.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.840]  And, uh, that was one of the things I liked most about working the retail counter is watching
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.200]  people's faces light up.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.800]  Like they were just learning about Santa.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]  He's a small kid.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]  I get to choose.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]  They, yeah, they walk in.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.120]  And you're not going to rip me off.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.440]  I get to watch the numbers on the scale from my side and your side.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440]  That's awesome.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440]  Yep.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.240]  It's so much fun watching people's faces light up when they see what the possibilities really
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.240]  are for this.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.200]  Um, but then again, I read stuff like how it is on the East coast right now in a lot
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.840]  of places and I just cringe.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.800]  Well, that's why we're here.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.120]  We're trying to educate everybody so that we can legalize places everywhere.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]  Legalize cannabis.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]  You guys, he's, we've been going for an hour.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.520]  I can send him, start wrapping up this podcast.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.360]  We can go for an hour and five minutes.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.880]  I legalize it everywhere.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.680]  I don't see any other, any better way to wrap the show.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680]  That's perfect.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]  Legalize it everywhere.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.800]  Other than asking for people to follow, follow Mike on Twitter, follow us on 15, follow me
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.440]  on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]  Follow me on Facebook.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.720]  Go from your heart podcast.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240]  Of course, check me out on Instagram.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.240]  I re underscore genetics.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240]  Look at my cannabis photography.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:06.480]  Um, it would be cool if you go to iTunes, uh, search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.840]  You should definitely do that.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.080]  Click on the little icon there.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.320]  Go to the ratings and review section.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.300]  Give me a, leave me a review and give me a rating.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.160]  So far, everybody has left me a five star review.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.760]  There are 39 or 45 star reviews at this point in time.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.760]  Be cool.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]  Be like everybody else.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.360]  Throw me that five star review.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.360]  I'm not begging for it.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  I think I deserve go for it.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  I'd love to see it.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.200]  Also, Patreon, you guys, uh, don't forget about Patreon.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.440]  Patreon is a service that allows you to financially support the podcast.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.920]  All I'm asking for is help, uh, taking the cost of the website, uh, off of my back and
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920]  maybe getting a little support from the listeners.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.120]  The podcast will always be free.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.280]  You guys, I'd love giving you this podcast, but if you'd like to go to Patreon and sign
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.600]  up, you can contribute as little as $1.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.780]  And I don't think there's a limit to how many zeros you can put on there.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.120]  So go for $1, go for a million dollars, however you'd like to do it.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.480]  I'll give you a shout out on the podcast to say, thank you.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.840]  I would love to see you up there.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.000]  If you contribute a million, I will convince him to do something a little bigger than to
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  shout you out on the podcast.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.880]  I'll do a podcast about whatever you want.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.040]  If you send me a million dollars, if you, we'll talk about whatever you want, a million
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.960]  bucks, anything, a million bucks.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]  Who wouldn't, right?
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.960]  Okay.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.640]  Uh, patreon.com, no, patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640]  Check it out.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.360]  I'm not asking anybody for a million dollars.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.520]  One dollar is plenty.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.880]  Uh, if you cannot contribute, please keep listening to the podcast.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.000]  I still appreciate you.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  There are a few people out there that will throw down a dollar.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  It'll help with what I'm trying to do.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.800]  I'm trying to cover the cost of the website to keep the podcast coming to you so that
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.320]  it doesn't come out of my pocket.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.920]  I can cover it, but I'd rather not.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.000]  Uh, if you find that you got some value from the show, go ahead and throw me a buck.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.320]  If you can't do it, times are tough.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.320]  I fucking get it.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320]  I'm the one asking you for money.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.560]  I can't be mad that you don't have any extra money.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.560]  I get it.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.880]  I totally get it, but I appreciate the people that can contribute.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880]  Truly do appreciate that.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.680]  You guys, I feel like I've been going on for a long time.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.600]  Mike, I owe you a huge thank you for coming and doing two podcasts with me.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.120]  We crushed it tonight.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.320]  Yeah, we, we did a good job.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.320]  I think you did a great job.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.640]  I let you talk for a whole bunch cause you had a lot of shit on your mind.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.440]  So I guess it's been a really fun couple of weeks in news.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.040]  I mean, there's been a lot of scary news announcements, but there's been a lot of good ones too.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.600]  Um, I cannot wait to see what the future brings.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.400]  Did it's 2017 is going to be interesting as shit.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400]  Not all in good ways.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.400]  Like a lot of scary.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.000]  He just made 37 facial expressions trying to think about these.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.960]  So many different possibilities for next year.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.440]  It looks like on total recall and the dude's mask broke.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.960]  The only thing that got less likely is the aliens making contact guaranteed.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.400]  If they're watching us from above, they're continuing their policy of wait and see for
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.000]  the next four years.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.680]  Other than that, pretty much every fucking other possibility from peace on earth to nuclear
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.720]  war got like 5% more likely, um, this year to last year.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.120]  So yeah, it's going to be an interesting year for damn sure.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.240]  It's absolutely going to be an interesting year.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.720]  That dude's got the combination to the button.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720]  Dude.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:05.040]  And the, the least confusing thing so far about Trump being elected is Trump getting
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.600]  elected, which is confusing in its own right.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.880]  But all of the decisions he's made since election night have been more confusing than America
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]  choosing to elect him.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.680]  You guys, if you're not following Trump's Twitter feed, just do it.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680]  That should have followed.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.280]  I've created a, finally broke down and created a Twitter feed to follow it.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.280]  Just to follow Trump.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.280]  Just to follow.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280]  Go check it out.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.560]  You guys, if you're pooping or whatever you're doing, just go give it a good follow and just
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.840]  like his tweets because it's hilarious.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.200]  Don't feel the need to like them.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.400]  You should be following them.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.280]  What you should do though is go to Twitter and follow the girl from your heart podcast.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.240]  You should definitely follow us on Twitter.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240]  You can find me on there also.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240]  I'm at Rasta Jeff 420.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.120]  I'd love it if you'd follow me.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120]  I'd love it.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120]  I love all the social interaction.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.040]  If you want to contact me and interact with me, or if you've got a product that you would
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.360]  like me to review and you don't want to reach out on social media, send me an email.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.360]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.480]  You know, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.960]  I am slowly working my way through all of the emails that people send me.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.000]  I am overwhelmed by messages, but keep them coming because I like it.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.480]  I am going to get through all of them before the end of time.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.880]  Hopefully I get to your problem in your garden before your garden is harvested.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.280]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.880]  The email is the best way to ask good questions.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.280]  If you've got a growth question or a policy question or a good question for Jeff that
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.360]  you'd like him to answer on the show, email is the best way to do it.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:33.160]  And I've repeatedly seen him contact and then drag the appropriate person to respond or
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:39.160]  the person that was requested to respond back on the show to get your question answered.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160]  And that's huge.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.760]  What other podcaster is going to recruit people from Denver to come down and answer your organics
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]  questions?
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760]  Sometimes I drive to Denver for them.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760]  It's 130 miles, guys.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]  Anyway, we're going to wrap up the show.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.200]  It's been an hour and 10, an hour and 11 minutes.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.040]  Mike, huge thanks again for coming.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.040]  Happy to send you back home.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.200]  I'm going to send you home back to the family real quick here.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.960]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.360]  Thanks so much for having me again.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360]  You're invited back.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.200]  We'll have you millions of more times.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.960]  We're going to make this podcast go a billion episodes.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.960]  A billion episodes.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.960]  That's a huge goal.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]  That's a huge goal.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.800]  We're going to need to get together more than a couple of times a month to record that,
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.800]  buddy.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.280]  Guys, I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.960]  Guys and gals, we are not gingers.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages and everything in between.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.880]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.240]  Who's getting a shout out this week?
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]  How about everybody?
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.920]  Shout out to the coming new year.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920]  That's what I want to give a shout out to.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.920]  Shout out to 2016 being over and 2017 starting.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920]  Yes.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.920]  Shout out to new beginnings.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.800]  You guys, thanks again for listening.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.320]  I want to give you a huge shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.720]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:04.890]  Peace out.
[01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:10.750]  Bye.

[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.700]  Keep me in a deep dream
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.700]  Keep me close to home
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:30.700]  You don't wanna save me
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:34.700]  Sad is the song
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:38.700]  When you believe in things
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.700]  You don't understand
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.700]  Then you suffer
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.700]  Superstition ain't the way
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:14:18.600]  Very superstitious
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.600]  Nothing more to say
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.600]  Very superstitious
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600]  Devil's on the way
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:48.910]  70 years of bad
[01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:50.910]  Good things in your past
[01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:58.210]  When you believe you don't understand
[01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:02.540]  Then you suffer
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.540]  Superstition ain't the way
