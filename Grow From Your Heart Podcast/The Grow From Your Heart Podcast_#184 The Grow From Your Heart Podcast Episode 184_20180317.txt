[00:16.960 --> 00:19.520]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.560]  It's time for episodes four, five, and six
[00:21.560 --> 00:23.120]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.120 --> 00:26.640]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.640 --> 00:27.720]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.720 --> 00:28.980]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.980 --> 00:31.400]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.400 --> 00:33.320]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.320 --> 00:35.880]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.880 --> 00:38.040]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.920]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.920 --> 00:42.740]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.740 --> 00:44.880]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.880 --> 00:46.520]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.520 --> 00:48.840]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.840 --> 00:52.640]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.640 --> 00:57.640]  You guys, I'm doing another one of those throwback episodes.
[00:59.600 --> 01:02.220]  Last time I brought you episodes one, two, and three.
[01:02.220 --> 01:04.700]  This time we're gonna do episodes four, five, and six
[01:04.700 --> 01:07.900]  for those people who have been jonesing for old episodes.
[01:07.900 --> 01:10.560]  Before I get into it, I do need to make a disclaimer.
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.120]  I've gone 185 episodes, and since I started recording,
[01:15.120 --> 01:18.720]  I have learned a lot about cannabis and a lot about growing.
[01:18.720 --> 01:20.840]  Some of the things I said in the earlier episodes,
[01:20.840 --> 01:23.280]  my ideas and opinions may have changed.
[01:23.280 --> 01:26.040]  Please don't hold anything I said in the past against me.
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.880]  Also, all of the social media has changed.
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.840]  Please ignore all of the I Grow Culture social media.

[01:52.040 --> 01:55.640]  and I am going to play episodes four, five, and six

[02:56.900 --> 02:58.580]  This song is Love Ja Dub.
[03:00.420 --> 03:03.060]  So we're coming to you with a very special episode.
[03:03.060 --> 03:05.180]  You guys might not be aware that
[03:05.180 --> 03:08.340]  I am a co-host of a podcast called 719 The Blocks.
[03:08.340 --> 03:11.300]  And one night, me and my bro that hosts that with me,
[03:11.300 --> 03:14.820]  we were out at a hookah bar and we met a cat named Gary.
[03:14.820 --> 03:16.900]  We told him about 719 The Blocks and he listened.
[03:16.900 --> 03:19.460]  And later he messaged us saying he wanted to be on the show
[03:19.460 --> 03:20.500]  and talk about weed.
[03:20.500 --> 03:23.420]  Well, Gary didn't know that I've got a weed podcast.
[03:24.060 --> 03:25.100]  So we brought him on 719 The Blocks
[03:25.100 --> 03:28.460]  with intentions to record 719 The Blocks
[03:28.460 --> 03:30.980]  and use parts of that for this show.
[03:30.980 --> 03:32.500]  So what I did was cut out the parts
[03:32.500 --> 03:34.300]  I found valuable for you guys.
[03:34.300 --> 03:35.300]  And here you go.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.740]  This is what I got from my friend Gary.
[03:36.740 --> 03:38.460]  Check it out, I hope you enjoy.
[03:38.460 --> 03:39.300]  Let's go for it.
[03:39.300 --> 03:41.260]  So I just thought it'd be a good opportunity, right?
[03:41.260 --> 03:43.820]  Because I'm a business student
[03:43.820 --> 03:48.560]  coming in from out of state to recognize the opportunity.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.480]  And you're kind of ensconced and you've been here
[03:50.480 --> 03:52.800]  and you've been part of the whole process.
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.560]  So it's two totally unique views.
[03:54.920 --> 03:55.840]  And I appreciate that.
[03:55.840 --> 03:58.440]  Yeah, so what I thought, and for our listeners,
[03:58.440 --> 03:59.960]  I just didn't record because I wanted
[03:59.960 --> 04:01.320]  to get what he was saying.
[04:01.320 --> 04:02.880]  We're doing the 719 The Blocks podcast
[04:02.880 --> 04:05.200]  and the I Grow Culture podcast at the same time.
[04:05.200 --> 04:07.400]  We're gonna do a dual episode.
[04:07.400 --> 04:08.240]  We're gonna record this.
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.480]  Wade's getting himself a cup of coffee
[04:09.480 --> 04:11.680]  and then he'll be right here to do the intro.
[04:11.680 --> 04:13.440]  But we're gonna record this one show
[04:13.440 --> 04:15.680]  and we're gonna post it on both of our feeds.
[04:15.680 --> 04:19.480]  You can listen to this at 719 The Blocks and I Grow Culture.
[04:19.480 --> 04:23.040]  And hey, if you're an I Grow Culture podcast listener,
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.920]  do me a favor and go check out
[04:24.920 --> 04:27.960]  mine and my bros podcast called 719 The Blocks.
[04:27.960 --> 04:30.960]  And then 100% if you like listen to 719 The Blocks,
[04:30.960 --> 04:32.400]  listen to I Grow Culture.
[04:32.400 --> 04:34.600]  And not only, all right, check it out.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.560]  So not only for to have some sort
[04:37.560 --> 04:40.000]  of different educated opinion
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.120]  to combat whatever the Pueblo chieftain says,
[04:42.120 --> 04:43.160]  fuck you chieftain.
[04:44.120 --> 04:47.520]  And then two, even if you don't like growing weed,
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.280]  I'm pretty sure what Jeff has to say
[04:49.280 --> 04:52.720]  about growing period probably applies.
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.000]  We haven't even talked much about growing yet.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.960]  I'm trying to build an audience before we start the growth.
[04:56.960 --> 04:57.800]  Oh, no shit.
[04:57.800 --> 04:58.960]  I wanna talk about-
[04:58.960 --> 04:59.800]  The growth school.
[04:59.800 --> 05:00.640]  Yeah, the growth school.
[05:00.640 --> 05:02.600]  The first episode was about edibles.
[05:02.600 --> 05:03.480]  Oh, yeah.
[05:03.480 --> 05:04.840]  There was a big report that the edibles
[05:04.840 --> 05:07.320]  weren't containing what the dose of THC they claimed.
[05:07.320 --> 05:09.200]  And did you see who commented on that, right?
[05:09.200 --> 05:10.040]  I did not.
[05:10.040 --> 05:10.880]  His name is Nick Naglich.
[05:10.880 --> 05:13.280]  He's the guy, he's a photographer of the pulp.
[05:13.280 --> 05:14.360]  He's like, I had no idea.
[05:14.360 --> 05:15.680]  He's like, I got a red card.
[05:15.680 --> 05:16.520]  I had no idea.
[05:16.520 --> 05:17.360]  Nice.
[05:17.360 --> 05:18.320]  Yeah, so I mean, you're already reaching people.
[05:18.320 --> 05:19.160]  There we go.
[05:19.160 --> 05:20.720]  Episode two, we featured a phone interview
[05:20.720 --> 05:22.480]  with Addison DeMora from Steep Hill Labs
[05:23.240 --> 05:24.080]  Who is?
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.720]  Steep Hill Labs is the industry leader
[05:26.720 --> 05:29.480]  in medical marijuana testing facilities.
[05:29.480 --> 05:33.760]  They test your cannabis for THC, CBD, THC, V and N.
[05:33.760 --> 05:35.480]  How about hot fucking coffee?
[05:35.480 --> 05:36.840]  Is that good and hot for you?
[05:36.840 --> 05:37.680]  Yup.
[05:37.680 --> 05:39.160]  It just came out of the, you poured it out of the pot.
[05:39.160 --> 05:40.080]  That seems great.
[05:40.080 --> 05:41.920]  So our second episode had Addison DeMora
[05:41.920 --> 05:45.080]  talking about residual solvents left in hash.
[05:45.080 --> 05:45.920]  Oh, yeah.
[05:45.920 --> 05:47.240]  So it's not just growing, we're learning a lot.
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.080]  Yeah.
[05:48.080 --> 05:50.400]  And we talk a lot about just goings on in weed.
[05:50.400 --> 05:51.240]  Of course.
[05:51.240 --> 05:52.760]  We try to dispel myths and education.
[05:52.760 --> 05:55.840]  Well, yeah, and that's muy importante
[05:55.840 --> 05:58.720]  just because it's another information source for people.
[05:58.720 --> 06:00.720]  Even if you don't agree with marijuana,
[06:00.720 --> 06:02.720]  there's still another information source.
[06:02.720 --> 06:05.440]  So I don't agree with the Bush presidency.
[06:05.440 --> 06:07.520]  So I don't agree with everything he said.
[06:07.520 --> 06:08.920]  So I watch YouTube.
[06:08.920 --> 06:09.760]  Okay.
[06:09.760 --> 06:11.120]  And there's a lot of information on YouTube
[06:11.120 --> 06:12.160]  about George Bush.
[06:12.160 --> 06:13.920]  You get to watch him turn into a reptile?
[06:13.920 --> 06:14.760]  Yup.
[06:16.280 --> 06:17.440]  All right.
[06:17.440 --> 06:18.480]  Do the little intro.
[06:18.480 --> 06:19.320]  All right.
[06:19.320 --> 06:21.320]  So hey guys, 719 The Blocks podcast

[06:40.120 --> 06:41.240]  Canavancher, Sin City.
[06:41.240 --> 06:42.200]  A lot of my friends are on there.
[06:42.200 --> 06:43.080]  Shout out to you guys.
[06:43.080 --> 06:45.520]  I just want to start growing so I can have a nickname.
[06:45.520 --> 06:46.800]  That's really all I want.
[06:46.800 --> 06:48.560]  Like, plug the fuck in.
[06:49.280 --> 06:52.240]  The Arabian Punjab.
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.120]  We all use our,
[06:53.120 --> 06:54.440]  it's funny because when we go places,
[06:54.440 --> 06:56.080]  people are like, what's up, Irie?
[06:56.080 --> 06:56.920]  Or what's up?
[06:56.920 --> 06:57.760]  We say what's up to them.
[06:57.760 --> 06:59.720]  And I don't even know half my friend's real name.
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.880]  Ewok, I don't know his real name.
[07:00.880 --> 07:02.480]  But if I say Ewok, he looks.
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.240]  You guys are like a pseudo gang culture,
[07:06.240 --> 07:07.640]  but you're not a gang at all.
[07:07.640 --> 07:08.720]  Nah, we're so peaceful.
[07:08.720 --> 07:09.560]  Yeah, right.
[07:09.560 --> 07:10.680]  We're going to show up to your house and dab you out.
[07:10.680 --> 07:11.960]  Yeah, you are.
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.440]  Also, fuck you, Cloud.
[07:13.440 --> 07:15.000]  Fuck you, Mike.
[07:15.000 --> 07:15.840]  That's right.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.680]  Never forget.
[07:16.720 --> 07:18.960]  Negro culture podcast listeners are confused by that.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.800]  Don't give a fuck.
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.800]  That's a tradition here on the 719 the Block podcast.
[07:22.800 --> 07:23.640]  It is, sorry.
[07:23.640 --> 07:25.200]  It's got to be done on every single one.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.640]  So let's get down to some business.
[07:26.640 --> 07:27.880]  Yeah, absolutely, 100%.
[07:27.880 --> 07:29.440]  We're crunched on time because I got to go
[07:29.440 --> 07:34.160]  to Looney's open mic to fucking get registered to...
[07:35.760 --> 07:36.600]  Be a comedian?
[07:36.600 --> 07:37.960]  Yeah.
[07:37.960 --> 07:39.880]  So I could be learned to be a comedian.
[07:39.880 --> 07:41.360]  Wade's going to comedy us up tonight.
[07:41.360 --> 07:42.840]  No, yeah, well, yeah, I am.
[07:42.840 --> 07:43.680]  On a double end.
[07:43.680 --> 07:46.200]  It's been a great, like, 24 hours of comedy for me.
[07:46.720 --> 07:49.160]  So I'm trying to keep the roll going, I guess.
[07:49.160 --> 07:51.120]  Do we want to talk about what you did last night briefly?
[07:51.120 --> 07:52.680]  Yeah, fuck yeah, I want to talk about this.
[07:52.680 --> 07:55.520]  I got to see my buddy Wade perform live
[07:55.520 --> 07:58.960]  at fucking Comedy Works downtown in Denver, Colorado.
[07:58.960 --> 07:59.800]  Right?
[07:59.800 --> 08:00.920]  And if you don't know Comedy Works,

[08:04.240 --> 08:05.120]  I've seen Mark Maron.
[08:05.120 --> 08:06.400]  I've seen Josh Blue.
[08:06.400 --> 08:08.600]  Oh, I think we're going to go see Benson again on the 11th.
[08:08.600 --> 08:10.240]  We're going to go see...
[08:10.240 --> 08:12.400]  You want to go see Anthony Jeselnik with me on April 27th?
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.240]  Yeah, but I'll go do it.
[08:14.240 --> 08:15.640]  Yeah, but I mean, like,
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.920]  so Arya Shafir, Joe Rogan, these guys,
[08:17.920 --> 08:20.040]  Joey Cocodea, they rate Denver Comedy Works
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.240]  as one of the top five comedy clubs in America.
[08:22.240 --> 08:23.920]  And I would agree.
[08:23.920 --> 08:24.880]  Wade got to perform there.
[08:24.880 --> 08:25.720]  Yeah.
[08:25.720 --> 08:26.560]  He crushed.
[08:26.560 --> 08:27.400]  Thank you.
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.240]  You got a two minute set and he crushed.
[08:28.240 --> 08:29.080]  Yes, thank you.
[08:29.080 --> 08:29.920]  He crushed.
[08:29.920 --> 08:30.760]  Thank you very much, man.
[08:30.760 --> 08:32.960]  I was the sixth one up, which was very shocking to me
[08:32.960 --> 08:34.920]  because I thought I was going to be like the second one
[08:34.920 --> 08:37.920]  or the first one up, so that's what I was prepping for.
[08:37.920 --> 08:40.240]  But being the sixth one up, that's like my,
[08:40.240 --> 08:41.360]  that's my bad bitch number.
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.480]  You had a golden spot right there.
[08:42.480 --> 08:44.440]  That's my, that's the number I want to be, so.
[08:44.440 --> 08:45.920]  Big thanks to the guy that went before you
[08:45.920 --> 08:49.360]  who bombed and made it, it made it easy for you to crush.
[08:49.360 --> 08:50.200]  To look good, dude.
[08:50.200 --> 08:51.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:51.040 --> 08:52.760]  Cause that guy just smeared shit all over the stage.
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.680]  So, so, that poor guy did that.
[08:57.680 --> 08:59.920]  The guy who runs the thing comes up as he's going,
[08:59.920 --> 09:01.400]  he's like, how'd you like to follow that?
[09:01.400 --> 09:02.880]  I don't know, he's like, what, you know,
[09:02.880 --> 09:05.400]  his exact words were, are you ready for that?
[09:05.400 --> 09:06.400]  And I was like, oh.
[09:07.440 --> 09:08.280]  Thanks.
[09:08.280 --> 09:09.120]  You recovered it.
[09:09.120 --> 09:09.960]  Yeah.
[09:09.960 --> 09:10.800]  You definitely brought it back.
[09:10.800 --> 09:12.640]  Well, I just came out and the first thing that I did, Gary,
[09:12.640 --> 09:13.840]  it freaked me the fuck out.
[09:13.880 --> 09:17.800]  This is how, guys, if you don't want to give Jeff
[09:17.800 --> 09:19.720]  a lot of fucking credit for sound,
[09:19.720 --> 09:23.840]  like a lot of credit for sound, I had no idea.
[09:23.840 --> 09:25.680]  That's why I sound distracted on the show often.
[09:25.680 --> 09:28.400]  Yeah, I grabbed the microphone on Comedy Works
[09:28.400 --> 09:30.680]  and I talk into it and I don't think it's on
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.560]  because the sound is that perfect.
[09:32.560 --> 09:33.800]  It was perfect in that.
[09:33.800 --> 09:34.640]  Perfect.
[09:34.640 --> 09:36.480]  Even for the listeners, it was so perfect.
[09:36.480 --> 09:38.320]  And I'm a loud bitch.
[09:38.320 --> 09:39.160]  It was glorious.
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.000]  And, and.
[09:42.160 --> 09:43.680]  Wade's a comedian to the iGrow Culture Plus.
[09:44.520 --> 09:45.360]  Thank you.
[09:45.360 --> 09:46.200]  Yeah, if you couldn't get that one.
[09:46.200 --> 09:47.040]  Wade's a comedian.
[09:47.040 --> 09:47.880]  We're gonna have to introduce these guys.
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.960]  Yeah, well, it's so, the great thing about that whole set,
[09:50.960 --> 09:54.040]  or not the set, but just the set up, I should say,
[09:54.040 --> 09:57.160]  is that the stage, it is so personal.
[09:57.160 --> 09:59.680]  That audience is right there.
[09:59.680 --> 10:02.480]  You could see about the first four to five rows.
[10:03.560 --> 10:05.560]  Everyone's very involved.
[10:05.560 --> 10:07.000]  They are right on top of you.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.880]  And you get the looks of, if you're bombing at all,
[10:09.880 --> 10:11.960]  you could see disappointment.
[10:11.960 --> 10:13.640]  I got a lot of it.
[10:14.480 --> 10:16.920]  But it wasn't like that for me, man, thankfully enough.
[10:16.920 --> 10:18.680]  It was good preparation.
[10:19.640 --> 10:22.720]  I was being a Nazi OCD about my time.
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.000]  You know what, hey, can we take a quick time out?
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.360]  I'm sorry, we have a fucking guest here.
[10:29.360 --> 10:30.200]  Jesus Christ.
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.520]  That's why I said briefly talk about your show.
[10:33.520 --> 10:35.200]  We have a guest here that's with us as well.
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.880]  We're not trying to ignore him.
[10:36.880 --> 10:38.400]  So yeah, I just wanted to really give you credit.
[10:38.400 --> 10:39.880]  Oh no, I still wanna talk about it.
[10:39.880 --> 10:41.600]  I just want, yeah, I still wanna talk.
[10:41.600 --> 10:42.440]  There's more.
[10:42.440 --> 10:43.280]  You deserve credit on.
[10:43.920 --> 10:44.760]  I appreciate that.
[10:44.760 --> 10:46.000]  I'm proud of my friend, Wade.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.160]  He crushed it on stage.
[10:47.160 --> 10:49.120]  I wanted to make sure to say that on the air.
[10:49.120 --> 10:49.960]  Yeah, so let's go ahead.
[10:49.960 --> 10:51.520]  Let's move on to Gary, actually.
[10:53.080 --> 10:56.000]  And for those of you on the comedy front and I grow culture,
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.480]  check out the Blocks Comedy at Facebook, just to look at.
[10:59.480 --> 11:00.560]  I post there as well.
[11:00.560 --> 11:01.840]  He does all the time.
[11:01.840 --> 11:04.960]  So Gary is, I don't wanna say transient,
[11:04.960 --> 11:08.840]  but you're a new transplant from, where are you from, Gary?
[11:08.840 --> 11:11.400]  I've been in Austin, Texas the last 20 years,
[11:11.400 --> 11:13.040]  originally from Louisiana.
[11:13.800 --> 11:14.880]  What part of Louisiana are you in?
[11:14.880 --> 11:17.360]  Just south of Shreveport, Mansfield, Louisiana.
[11:17.360 --> 11:18.200]  Small town.
[11:18.200 --> 11:19.040]  Yeah, it is.
[11:20.120 --> 11:20.960]  So.
[11:20.960 --> 11:22.040]  Wanna talk about how we met him?
[11:22.040 --> 11:22.880]  Yeah, I wanna talk.
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.720]  Are you comfortable with that?
[11:23.720 --> 11:24.560]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[11:24.560 --> 11:26.880]  There's a local hookah bar, the Cloud Nine Hookah Bar,
[11:26.880 --> 11:31.120]  that once in a while, we'll do an invite only dab party.
[11:31.120 --> 11:33.280]  They call it a private party and they invite us down
[11:33.280 --> 11:35.160]  and we go there and do dabs in the hookah bar.
[11:35.160 --> 11:36.280]  It's awesome.
[11:36.280 --> 11:37.120]  It's quite fun.
[11:37.120 --> 11:39.080]  I get a couch and take some dabs with me
[11:39.080 --> 11:41.640]  and I dab everybody out and they offer the dabs there.
[11:41.640 --> 11:43.520]  But Gary was sitting next to me and noticed
[11:43.520 --> 11:45.040]  that I might know a couple of people there
[11:45.040 --> 11:47.280]  and sparked up conversation.
[11:47.280 --> 11:48.480]  And he sounded super intelligent,
[11:48.480 --> 11:49.520]  so I introduced Wade and I.
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.040]  Wade's a comedian, I was like, check out Wade.
[11:51.040 --> 11:52.160]  I always plug Wade.
[11:52.160 --> 11:54.200]  Because Wade was on one that night.
[11:54.200 --> 11:56.160]  He was a cocky bastard.
[11:56.160 --> 11:57.800]  So I had to introduce him as a comedian
[11:57.800 --> 12:00.240]  to people would be like, that's why he's a dick.
[12:01.680 --> 12:03.160]  I was just looking at girls, man.
[12:03.160 --> 12:04.080]  Yeah, you were having fun.
[12:04.080 --> 12:06.120]  I think you came from a comedy show to that show.
[12:06.120 --> 12:08.680]  So you were in that snap mode.
[12:08.680 --> 12:10.240]  But that's how we met Gary.
[12:10.240 --> 12:12.160]  So what else did you want to get from us?
[12:12.160 --> 12:13.760]  Gary, yeah, I don't know.
[12:13.760 --> 12:15.560]  So Gary started coming to comedy shows.
[12:15.560 --> 12:17.400]  So he does have like a good frame of reference
[12:17.400 --> 12:19.960]  of like comedy within like what we're going on.
[12:19.960 --> 12:23.320]  So to cut back to Comedy Works real quick,
[12:23.320 --> 12:24.600]  is that what we're doing?
[12:24.600 --> 12:25.440]  We're gonna talk about Gary,
[12:25.440 --> 12:26.400]  but we can talk about you some more.
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.600]  No, I don't need to talk about Comedy Works.
[12:27.600 --> 12:28.440]  I thought that was a segue.
[12:28.440 --> 12:29.440]  I'm sorry, I'm a little high.
[12:29.440 --> 12:30.280]  I'm high as shit.
[12:30.280 --> 12:33.080]  So Gary approaches me at the comedy show.
[12:33.080 --> 12:34.320]  We get higher on the I Grow Culture show
[12:34.320 --> 12:35.160]  than we do 700 Bucks.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.000]  Do you really?
[12:36.000 --> 12:36.840]  Oh, definitely.
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.680]  It's a weed show, bro.
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.520]  We take dabs in the hookah.
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.360]  Yeah, right.
[12:39.560 --> 12:40.400]  I'm laughing on my show.
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.600]  Gary comes up to me last week.
[12:41.600 --> 12:43.320]  He's like, hey man, I'd like to get on the podcast.
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.480]  I'd like to talk about the state of marijuana in Colorado,
[12:47.480 --> 12:49.200]  which is an interesting dynamic
[12:49.200 --> 12:51.840]  because Gary says he's from Austin.
[12:51.840 --> 12:54.640]  He's been there the past 20 years.
[12:54.640 --> 12:56.880]  Recently, how long you been in Pueblo?
[12:56.880 --> 12:58.600]  Since January the 8th.
[12:58.600 --> 12:59.840]  January the 8th.
[12:59.840 --> 13:02.120]  Literally seven days after weed was legal.
[13:02.120 --> 13:03.680]  Gary's up in this motherfucker.
[13:05.280 --> 13:06.920]  And you're here to do what, Gary?
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.440]  Working on my degree at CSU.
[13:11.440 --> 13:12.720]  And at the same time,
[13:12.720 --> 13:16.400]  looking to get into the marijuana business.
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.400]  Recently was hired as a operations manager for a,
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.560]  he's a caregiver grower who is becoming licensed
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.040]  to be an offsite cultivation unit
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.520]  for a major dispensary out of Denver.
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.320]  A major chain of dispensaries.
[13:34.360 --> 13:43.730]  So he needs logistical.
[13:43.730 --> 13:45.890]  This is just the back end of that.
[13:45.890 --> 13:47.770]  He's the expert grower.
[13:47.770 --> 13:49.170]  And that's his expertise.
[13:49.170 --> 13:50.290]  He needs someone to make sure
[13:50.290 --> 13:51.690]  all the materials are there on time.
[13:51.690 --> 13:52.530]  Of course.
[13:52.530 --> 13:56.360]  And manage the people and that kind of thing.
[13:56.360 --> 13:57.840]  Now, you come to me,
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.480]  you say the state of weed in Colorado,
[14:00.480 --> 14:03.240]  and define this statement, essentially.
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.240]  Well, gosh, we're in a significant economic genesis here,
[14:13.260 --> 14:14.940]  with the legalization of marijuana.
[14:15.580 --> 14:16.420]  They just reported today,
[14:16.420 --> 14:18.620]  the revenues were up.
[14:18.620 --> 14:20.460]  Revenues were up again.
[14:20.460 --> 14:28.000]  Friday, Eric Holder, US Attorney General, announced public.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.840]  What do you mean reschedule, Gary?
[14:31.680 --> 14:33.080]  What's rescheduling mean?
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.360]  Take it to from where it's being treated as,
[14:36.360 --> 14:39.200]  you know, like heroin now.
[14:39.200 --> 14:40.040]  Essentially.
[14:40.040 --> 14:42.840]  To where it's treated more like nicotine or alcohol.
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.600]  Reclassify the caliber of drug it is.
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.160]  Which I think is legit.
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.120]  Well, that's legal.
[14:50.120 --> 14:51.280]  I think changing it is legit.
[14:51.280 --> 14:52.880]  I don't think the current is legit.
[14:52.880 --> 14:54.600]  I think changing it is the way to go.
[14:54.600 --> 14:56.480]  Yeah, and that's gonna be, you know,
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.680]  that's legalization, effectively.
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.580]  You know, it's well regulated, of course.
[15:02.580 --> 15:03.420]  Of course.
[15:03.420 --> 15:07.380]  But just like alcohol and tobacco, legal, obtainable.
[15:08.980 --> 15:13.260]  Okay, so if that does happen,
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.820]  do you feel an onslaught coming?
[15:15.820 --> 15:20.060]  Do we feel that Colorado is going to be
[15:20.060 --> 15:22.260]  under a microscope even more?
[15:22.260 --> 15:24.100]  Probably less at that point.
[15:24.100 --> 15:26.020]  It'll go nationwide, so there'll be
[15:26.020 --> 15:28.060]  a lot more places to stare at.
[15:28.060 --> 15:30.660]  Some indication that it could be a global thing, too,
[15:30.660 --> 15:31.860]  if you really follow the news.
[15:31.860 --> 15:34.020]  You know, Uruguay legalized.
[15:34.020 --> 15:34.860]  Right?
[15:34.860 --> 15:36.060]  Yeah, $1 grand, man.
[15:36.060 --> 15:37.420]  At the time that they legalized,
[15:37.420 --> 15:39.940]  which was only, what, six, seven months ago?
[15:39.940 --> 15:41.820]  They were criticized by the UN.
[15:41.820 --> 15:43.540]  Still are being criticized by the UN.
[15:43.540 --> 15:45.700]  Well, the UN's changed its position now
[15:45.700 --> 15:48.340]  on drugs in general, saying that criminalization
[15:48.340 --> 15:51.900]  is not effective, and this was official
[15:51.900 --> 15:54.260]  as of, like, the beginning of the month.
[15:54.260 --> 15:56.220]  That they're officially changing their position
[15:56.220 --> 15:59.260]  that criminalization of drugs is detrimental
[15:59.260 --> 16:03.320]  to the population.
[16:03.320 --> 16:06.880]  So, do you think the government's just trying
[16:06.880 --> 16:09.700]  to get a jump then on, like, the process,
[16:09.700 --> 16:10.840]  the money that they're missing?
[16:10.840 --> 16:11.720]  Because they're getting the weed,
[16:11.720 --> 16:13.400]  but I mean, if they want their sticky fingers
[16:13.400 --> 16:14.840]  and sticky fingers, you know.
[16:14.840 --> 16:16.320]  Another significant indicator,
[16:16.320 --> 16:21.320]  and just a delicious bit of irony,
[16:21.440 --> 16:28.250]  is that the government got a jump on every-
[16:28.250 --> 16:29.090]  What?
[16:29.090 --> 16:29.910]  Wait, what?
[16:29.910 --> 16:30.750]  See, I wasn't aware.
[16:30.750 --> 16:31.570]  I had heard about it,
[16:31.570 --> 16:32.410]  but I didn't know it actually happened.
[16:32.410 --> 16:34.690]  Yeah, the US Department of Health
[16:34.690 --> 16:41.920]  holds the patent.
[16:41.920 --> 16:42.760]  It's out there.
[16:42.760 --> 16:44.200]  So that means they knew that it was valuable
[16:44.200 --> 16:45.760]  and useful and medicinal.
[16:45.760 --> 16:48.680]  Yeah, and you can also say that this movement
[16:48.680 --> 16:53.260]  of legalization and orchestrated by someone,
[16:53.260 --> 16:54.100]  you know?
[16:54.100 --> 16:54.920]  Oh, look at that.
[16:54.920 --> 16:55.940]  The quickness that it happened,
[16:55.940 --> 16:57.700]  once it was legal, everything just fell right
[16:57.700 --> 17:00.300]  into place so quickly that I wouldn't doubt that one bit.
[17:00.300 --> 17:04.060]  So, okay, we're not gonna fucking move on from this now.
[17:04.060 --> 17:07.040]  You guys are just throwing some fucking assumptions
[17:07.040 --> 17:08.980]  out there without some details, guys.
[17:08.980 --> 17:09.820]  What do we mean?
[17:09.820 --> 17:12.340]  Like I say, it seems like, I don't have any details,
[17:12.340 --> 17:13.780]  but it looks like everything fell into place
[17:13.780 --> 17:15.580]  perfectly from my view.
[17:15.580 --> 17:17.940]  Like, you talk about the things that are coming.
[17:17.940 --> 17:19.180]  What do you call it?
[17:19.180 --> 17:20.700]  Pueblo Springs Ranch?
[17:21.940 --> 17:22.780]  Correct.
[17:22.780 --> 17:24.980]  Dude, that happened, like, the day after they announced.
[17:24.980 --> 17:25.820]  Oh yeah, it's legit.
[17:26.660 --> 17:30.980]  Pueblo Springs Ranch was supposed to be going up 2008.
[17:30.980 --> 17:31.820]  Okay.
[17:31.820 --> 17:32.660]  Before the recession.
[17:32.660 --> 17:33.860]  There's a lot of things that seemed to have just,
[17:33.860 --> 17:35.300]  all the businesses were booming.
[17:35.300 --> 17:36.460]  Everything went right away.
[17:36.460 --> 17:38.260]  They're like, okay, and it was just like
[17:38.260 --> 17:39.380]  the troops were lined up.
[17:39.380 --> 17:42.460]  Are you talking about since January 1st or since MMJ?
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.280]  January 1st.
[17:43.280 --> 17:44.120]  Okay.
[17:44.120 --> 17:44.960]  Yeah.
[17:44.960 --> 17:45.900]  MMJ was a good start.
[17:45.900 --> 17:49.340]  So what the fuck is the fight for then,
[17:49.340 --> 17:52.860]  from like city council and shit like that?
[17:52.860 --> 17:54.900]  Like, do you feel city council, for the most part,
[17:54.900 --> 17:57.740]  city council is allowing this.
[17:57.740 --> 18:00.500]  They are being kind of shitty on the no MMJ
[18:00.500 --> 18:02.780]  inside city limits fucking thing.
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.020]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.900]  They should allow at least one good dispensary
[18:07.900 --> 18:09.860]  within city limits, because they're losing out on money.
[18:09.860 --> 18:11.460]  They're losing on so much money.
[18:11.460 --> 18:13.460]  And it's just locally here in Pueblo,
[18:13.460 --> 18:16.060]  it's old blood that is voting against the dispensaries.
[18:16.060 --> 18:18.780]  They're trying to keep downtown a historic district
[18:18.780 --> 18:19.620]  and let it be-
[18:19.620 --> 18:22.540]  So historic that they put a gym called Reps in it?
[18:22.540 --> 18:23.380]  Sorry, guys.
[18:23.700 --> 18:25.020]  But did you notice they didn't deface
[18:25.020 --> 18:26.420]  the front of the building in any way?
[18:26.420 --> 18:27.820]  They left it, it still looks like
[18:27.820 --> 18:29.260]  an old school building out front.
[18:29.260 --> 18:32.300]  Except for that trendy Reps sign on the front.
[18:32.300 --> 18:34.260]  The building is, that's why a lot of that stuff
[18:34.260 --> 18:35.220]  downtown is untouched.
[18:35.220 --> 18:36.420]  There are signs for buildings,
[18:36.420 --> 18:38.460]  there are signs for businesses that were there
[18:38.460 --> 18:39.900]  way back in the day that don't exist
[18:39.900 --> 18:41.380]  because the historic district won't let you
[18:41.380 --> 18:42.420]  deface those signs.
[18:42.420 --> 18:44.420]  Goddamn high opinion of themselves.
[18:44.420 --> 18:46.860]  Then that's kind of, I try to be more diplomatic
[18:46.860 --> 18:49.500]  about talking shit about my public officials.
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.620]  You're right, fuck them, because they do really
[18:51.620 --> 18:52.980]  try to think they control everything
[18:53.580 --> 18:55.460]  and they don't listen to what their public wants here.
[18:55.460 --> 19:00.140]  Well, they've had a history of such actions.
[19:00.140 --> 19:02.140]  I mean, if you go back to the smoking ban,
[19:02.140 --> 19:04.580]  they banned smoking without putting it to a public vote,
[19:04.580 --> 19:07.500]  then we had to make this whole big issue out of it.
[19:07.500 --> 19:10.620]  They've wasted a lot of money and a lot of resources
[19:10.620 --> 19:14.940]  on a lot of gaudy shit, i.e. like the fucking
[19:14.940 --> 19:17.100]  new municipal fucking police court
[19:17.100 --> 19:18.660]  or whatever the fuck that building is
[19:18.660 --> 19:21.260]  that I don't want to go inside of ever.
[19:21.300 --> 19:23.580]  10 million or however much, and they still can't
[19:23.580 --> 19:25.940]  fucking pay enough people to put inside there.
[19:25.940 --> 19:28.900]  They just have a lot of goddamn issues.
[19:30.020 --> 19:34.780]  And marijuana seems to be a capable tool of solving.
[19:34.780 --> 19:36.820]  If you look at the reports, no crimes have gone up
[19:36.820 --> 19:38.260]  near dispensaries.
[19:38.260 --> 19:39.380]  If anything, it's gone down.
[19:39.380 --> 19:42.020]  They just released another report stating that crimes
[19:42.020 --> 19:45.460]  have gone, violent crimes have gone down.
[19:45.460 --> 19:47.020]  I guess it's depending on where you read
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.940]  because any news report just says what they want.
[19:48.980 --> 19:51.740]  Well, no, they released a national,
[19:51.740 --> 19:55.540]  or not a Colorado crime report for the past 90 days,
[19:55.540 --> 19:57.900]  like almost basically like the first quarter,
[19:57.900 --> 19:59.140]  which is a snapshot.
[19:59.140 --> 20:00.140]  Our probation period.
[20:00.140 --> 20:02.860]  Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it.
[20:02.860 --> 20:04.660]  And it basically, everything was down.
[20:04.660 --> 20:09.260]  There were like, I want to say there was like 80%
[20:09.260 --> 20:11.780]  of all of the things that they thought would be shitty
[20:11.780 --> 20:13.820]  were actually reversed.
[20:13.820 --> 20:14.940]  They don't realize that the weed heads
[20:14.940 --> 20:17.420]  are the peaceful guys sitting on the couch chilling.
[20:17.420 --> 20:18.460]  We're not all sitting on the couch,
[20:18.900 --> 20:20.140]  but we're doing our daily things.
[20:20.140 --> 20:21.860]  When we get baked, the worst thing we're going to do
[20:21.860 --> 20:23.660]  is eat everything in the fridge.
[20:23.660 --> 20:25.300]  Well, here's what I find hilarious
[20:25.300 --> 20:28.100]  is that they're trying to find things to highlight now.
[20:28.100 --> 20:29.700]  They're trying to highlight.
[20:29.700 --> 20:30.540]  Searching.
[20:30.540 --> 20:34.140]  And it's not just people's physical reaction to marijuana.
[20:34.140 --> 20:39.140]  It's anything that marijuana can do horrible to you.
[20:39.260 --> 20:40.900]  So Gary comes from Texas.
[20:40.900 --> 20:41.740]  Yeah.
[20:41.740 --> 20:45.220]  How is the difference of seeing, I'm sure in Texas,
[20:45.220 --> 20:48.180]  you, I have friends that have been incarcerated in Texas
[20:48.900 --> 20:49.940]  just for having weed.
[20:49.940 --> 20:52.860]  And here you can carry, you, I don't know,
[20:52.860 --> 20:54.660]  if you're not a medical patient in Colorado,
[20:54.660 --> 20:55.700]  you can possess an ounce.
[20:55.700 --> 20:59.020]  If you're just any random Joe in Colorado, 21 and over.
[20:59.020 --> 21:01.980]  How does it feel to just have, it's almost freedom here.
[21:01.980 --> 21:03.540]  It is a huge difference.
[21:03.540 --> 21:06.420]  And it really took me a while to adjust to that.
[21:08.500 --> 21:10.180]  Once, you know, going to some of the clubs,
[21:10.180 --> 21:12.460]  like in the Springs and, you know,
[21:12.460 --> 21:16.500]  walk into a room with a group of people that I don't know
[21:16.500 --> 21:18.780]  that are all high and getting high and it's open
[21:18.780 --> 21:20.500]  and it's legal and it's free.
[21:21.540 --> 21:23.580]  That's a completely unique experience for me.
[21:23.580 --> 21:24.940]  And I'm 43 years old.
[21:24.940 --> 21:26.780]  Nobody has to hide their shit when anybody walks in.
[21:26.780 --> 21:28.060]  Were you there when the police
[21:28.060 --> 21:29.460]  would like walk into Cloud Nine?
[21:29.460 --> 21:30.300]  Were you there?
[21:30.300 --> 21:31.780]  I was there when the police walked in and walked through
[21:31.780 --> 21:33.980]  and said hello to everyone and seemed just pleased
[21:33.980 --> 21:36.180]  that everybody was there and having a good time.
[21:36.180 --> 21:37.700]  They were like polite and cordial.
[21:37.700 --> 21:39.500]  I was the first person you see
[21:39.500 --> 21:40.900]  when you walked into this hookah bar.
[21:40.900 --> 21:42.580]  And I had my dab rig right in front of me,
[21:42.580 --> 21:44.540]  sitting on my oil slick pad,
[21:44.540 --> 21:45.740]  got my torch right in front of me.
[21:45.780 --> 21:47.700]  And the cops came in, two cops.
[21:47.700 --> 21:50.580]  And at first, you have that natural trigger.
[21:50.580 --> 21:52.340]  Your body goes, oh, fuck.
[21:52.340 --> 21:55.060]  But then in my brain, I went, oh, wait, wait, wait.
[21:55.060 --> 21:56.780]  First of all, I'm in my hometown.
[21:56.780 --> 21:58.540]  Like, I'm not really afraid to get arrested
[21:58.540 --> 21:59.660]  for weed in my hometown.
[21:59.660 --> 22:01.940]  Then I went, wait, wait, you're not, you can have all this.
[22:01.940 --> 22:03.220]  You're not doing anything illegal.
[22:03.220 --> 22:05.340]  Yeah, you look like you're smoking hookah anyway.
[22:05.340 --> 22:06.180]  I was trying.
[22:06.180 --> 22:07.020]  These guys are retarded.
[22:07.020 --> 22:07.860]  Marijuana on me.
[22:07.860 --> 22:08.700]  And they smiled at me, dude.
[22:08.700 --> 22:09.540]  They snickered at me.
[22:09.540 --> 22:11.420]  They gave me like the stupid weed head.
[22:11.420 --> 22:12.860]  Like, they looked at me like, cliche,
[22:12.860 --> 22:14.180]  that's what we expected to find.
[22:14.220 --> 22:15.700]  That shit makes you paranoid.
[22:15.700 --> 22:16.900]  Yeah, I guess so.
[22:16.900 --> 22:19.020]  Yeah, I was driving home with weed on me.
[22:19.020 --> 22:21.340]  A cop was like right behind me the other night.
[22:21.340 --> 22:25.260]  And I was just like, fuck.
[22:25.260 --> 22:26.340]  Then I was like, wait.
[22:27.700 --> 22:29.340]  I'm not doing anything fucking wrong.
[22:29.340 --> 22:31.020]  I'm cool.
[22:31.020 --> 22:31.980]  I'm cool.
[22:31.980 --> 22:33.020]  I'm all right here.
[22:33.020 --> 22:33.860]  I was coming home last night
[22:33.860 --> 22:35.340]  from dinner with a state trooper behind me
[22:35.340 --> 22:36.620]  and thinking the same shit.
[22:36.620 --> 22:39.740]  But now I kind of get like, huh, pull me over.
[22:39.740 --> 22:40.580]  That's cool.
[22:40.580 --> 22:42.900]  I'll show you what a dab looks like.
[22:42.900 --> 22:44.180]  I'm able to educate them now.
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.740]  I'm not afraid anymore.
[22:46.420 --> 22:47.300]  I'm an adult now.
[22:47.300 --> 22:48.700]  I know how to present myself.
[22:48.700 --> 22:49.540]  And I feel like-
[22:49.540 --> 22:50.580]  Well, that's really just part of it.
[22:50.580 --> 22:52.220]  People not having the fear.
[22:52.220 --> 22:54.660]  Just get over your fear of it to begin with.
[22:54.660 --> 22:55.500]  They're just people doing it.
[22:55.500 --> 22:56.420]  I mean, respect them.
[22:56.420 --> 22:57.700]  Yes, sir, no, sir.
[22:57.700 --> 22:59.140]  Don't fucking be a dick to any cops.
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.140]  But don't-
[23:00.140 --> 23:00.980]  I'm talking about-
[23:00.980 --> 23:03.740]  They don't have any super duper authority.
[23:03.740 --> 23:04.580]  God damn it.
[23:04.580 --> 23:05.420]  Hey guys, I'm sorry.
[23:05.420 --> 23:06.580]  I'm still figuring out my new phone.
[23:06.580 --> 23:10.380]  How are the cops in Texas when they find you with weed?
[23:10.380 --> 23:11.660]  Oh, you're going to jail?
[23:11.660 --> 23:12.500]  Instantly?
[23:12.500 --> 23:13.580]  Yeah.
[23:13.580 --> 23:14.420]  You're going to jail?
[23:14.420 --> 23:16.420]  Any amount of weed that's identifiable as weed,
[23:16.420 --> 23:17.260]  you're going to jail?
[23:17.260 --> 23:18.780]  Is that a felony or just a misdemeanor?
[23:18.780 --> 23:19.620]  It's a misdemeanor.
[23:19.620 --> 23:21.100]  Okay, unless you've got reasonable quantity.
[23:21.100 --> 23:23.500]  Anything under four ounces is a misdemeanor.
[23:23.500 --> 23:24.340]  Okay.
[23:24.340 --> 23:25.740]  Four ounces is a misdemeanor?
[23:25.740 --> 23:26.580]  Anything under four ounces?
[23:26.580 --> 23:27.420]  Under four ounces.
[23:27.420 --> 23:28.260]  That's a quarter pound of weed.
[23:28.260 --> 23:29.100]  That's nice then.
[23:29.100 --> 23:29.940]  I mean, you're not going to-
[23:29.940 --> 23:31.740]  Because there's some states where that's fucking-
[23:31.740 --> 23:32.900]  But think about it's Texas
[23:32.900 --> 23:34.820]  and they're talking about the Mexican brick weed,
[23:34.820 --> 23:35.660]  I would assume.
[23:35.660 --> 23:37.140]  Because that's mostly what's around Texas.
[23:37.140 --> 23:39.820]  It's just, they throw it over that fucking border.
[23:39.820 --> 23:42.860]  Concentrates though, they're a felony.
[23:42.860 --> 23:44.140]  It's just like heroin.
[23:44.860 --> 23:45.700]  So having a dab would be a felony?
[23:45.700 --> 23:46.540]  Yeah.
[23:46.540 --> 23:47.380]  You guys want to take a dab?
[23:47.380 --> 23:48.220]  Sure.
[23:48.220 --> 23:49.060]  Yeah.
[23:49.060 --> 23:49.900]  Wait, what?
[23:49.900 --> 23:50.740]  That's a felony?
[23:50.740 --> 23:51.820]  What the fuck's the point of that though?
[23:51.820 --> 23:53.420]  It's concentrate, it's derived.
[23:53.420 --> 23:56.060]  It's like heroin or cocaine.
[23:56.060 --> 23:57.900]  So guys, think about that.
[23:57.900 --> 24:00.700]  All my Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon listeners,
[24:00.700 --> 24:02.900]  Michigan, there are other states.
[24:02.900 --> 24:05.020]  Rhode Island, I think, New Hampshire, something like that.
[24:05.020 --> 24:08.060]  Some of the states, I'm going to go off on a tangent here.
[24:08.060 --> 24:09.260]  Yeah, go ahead.
[24:09.260 --> 24:11.180]  Illinois, we have a good friend who's Illinois,
[24:11.180 --> 24:13.700]  in Illinois, and he's like, I can't find weed anywhere.
[24:14.300 --> 24:15.140]  And so I did a quick Google search.
[24:15.140 --> 24:17.100]  I was like, you guys have medical marijuana
[24:17.100 --> 24:18.220]  there in Illinois.
[24:18.220 --> 24:20.420]  And he's like, get it for me, find it.
[24:20.420 --> 24:21.500]  And so I did more research.
[24:21.500 --> 24:23.620]  They've got the rules in place,
[24:23.620 --> 24:26.580]  and there are doctors that can recommend cannabis for you,
[24:26.580 --> 24:29.660]  but there is not a known place that I can find
[24:29.660 --> 24:31.780]  to buy medical marijuana.
[24:31.780 --> 24:33.940]  So some of the states that claim to have medical marijuana
[24:33.940 --> 24:35.220]  are kind of bullshit.
[24:35.220 --> 24:37.180]  You can basically grow your own.
[24:37.180 --> 24:38.660]  But you guys that are listening to these states
[24:38.660 --> 24:40.460]  where you can just drive somewhere down the street
[24:40.460 --> 24:43.260]  and get some dabs and drop a half gram dab
[24:43.780 --> 24:44.780]  and choke for 20 minutes and laugh
[24:44.780 --> 24:46.940]  and just take it for granted,
[24:46.940 --> 24:49.180]  this dude right here would have gone to prison.
[24:49.180 --> 24:51.220]  You don't look like you'd enjoy prison much by the looks of it.
[24:51.220 --> 24:52.900]  You don't look like the prison type.
[24:52.900 --> 24:53.740]  Not at all.
[24:53.740 --> 24:54.900]  They don't have a lot of books or computers in prison.
[24:54.900 --> 24:56.580]  Those seem to be things you'd enjoy.
[24:56.580 --> 24:57.780]  No, not at all.
[24:57.780 --> 25:00.900]  How much money does Texas, so here's like the big question.
[25:00.900 --> 25:01.740]  I'm going to take a dab.
[25:01.740 --> 25:02.580]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[25:02.580 --> 25:03.420]  We're all going to take a dab.
[25:03.420 --> 25:04.260]  It'll go around the table.
[25:04.260 --> 25:05.100]  When you hear us cough, and that's what's going on.
[25:05.100 --> 25:05.940]  Yeah, right.
[25:05.940 --> 25:06.780]  Here's a question.
[25:06.780 --> 25:08.780]  So I think this was something,
[25:08.780 --> 25:11.540]  maybe the number crunchers in the government
[25:11.540 --> 25:13.060]  were looking at. Stabs are from Green Dot.
[25:13.860 --> 25:14.700]  Oh, Green Dot.
[25:14.700 --> 25:15.740]  Green Dot, that's who we're dabbing from.
[25:15.740 --> 25:17.860]  Just a shout out since we're doing it on the show.
[25:19.220 --> 25:20.060]  It's tasty.
[25:22.540 --> 25:24.220]  I think the number crunchers in the government
[25:24.220 --> 25:29.220]  wanted to see if the revenue would outdo,
[25:30.580 --> 25:33.220]  the revenue made off of marijuana sales would outdo
[25:33.220 --> 25:36.820]  the revenue made off of DUI busts, marijuana busts.
[25:36.820 --> 25:37.740]  Property seizures.
[25:37.740 --> 25:39.580]  Correct, correct.
[25:39.580 --> 25:41.180]  I think that was something they were trying to see
[25:41.180 --> 25:42.300]  if they were going to do,
[25:42.340 --> 25:43.700]  if that was something they were going to be able
[25:43.700 --> 25:45.260]  to get away with.
[25:45.260 --> 25:47.700]  And I would say that's driving legalization
[25:47.700 --> 25:48.940]  as much as anything.
[25:48.940 --> 25:49.780]  Yeah.
[25:49.780 --> 25:51.540]  Because Colorado, it's more than double.
[25:51.540 --> 25:52.380]  Really?
[25:52.380 --> 25:53.260]  Yeah, I was reading the article.
[25:53.260 --> 25:55.900]  They were saying that a typical year,
[25:55.900 --> 26:00.300]  they net about 60 million in seizures.
[26:00.300 --> 26:01.140]  Shit.
[26:01.140 --> 26:02.140]  And they're projecting now,
[26:02.140 --> 26:04.060]  based on what the numbers they have,
[26:04.060 --> 26:06.100]  this year's first year revenue from taxes
[26:06.100 --> 26:07.180]  will be 134 million.
[26:07.180 --> 26:08.500]  From marijuana sales?
[26:08.500 --> 26:09.340]  From marijuana sales.
[26:09.340 --> 26:11.580]  You're goddamn right, 134 million.
[26:11.860 --> 26:14.620]  So it's more than double.
[26:14.620 --> 26:17.500]  So it's over with, man.
[26:17.500 --> 26:20.820]  The politicians want that money and they're gonna get it.
[26:20.820 --> 26:23.380]  And it's worth it just for the public relations aspects.
[26:23.380 --> 26:25.180]  Now I don't think, fuck the police.
[26:25.180 --> 26:26.700]  When weed was a crime,
[26:26.700 --> 26:28.620]  I used to have to think, fuck the police.
[26:28.620 --> 26:29.460]  Well, what about the-
[26:29.460 --> 26:30.500]  And now I can smile at them when they're behind me
[26:30.500 --> 26:31.340]  and chuckle.
[26:31.340 --> 26:32.180]  The benefits.
[26:32.180 --> 26:33.940]  So the benefits of marijuana that will be coming,
[26:33.940 --> 26:35.380]  like hemp, growing hemp,
[26:35.380 --> 26:36.780]  and what will come from growing hemp.
[26:36.780 --> 26:40.180]  Like how much money can communities start to save
[26:40.180 --> 26:43.820]  by having hemp products grown by the community
[26:43.820 --> 26:46.140]  instead of shopping at motherfucking Walmart?
[26:46.140 --> 26:49.180]  Dr. Bronner's company that makes hemp soap
[26:49.180 --> 26:51.420]  has to buy hemp grown in Canada
[26:51.420 --> 26:52.700]  and have it shipped to America-
[26:52.700 --> 26:53.620]  What the fuck?
[26:53.620 --> 26:54.700]  To make soap out of it
[26:54.700 --> 26:56.100]  because it's illegal to produce hemp.
[26:56.100 --> 26:58.860]  So the first major hemp crops
[26:58.860 --> 27:00.220]  that were produced in Colorado,
[27:00.220 --> 27:02.420]  guess who swooped that shit up, bro?
[27:02.420 --> 27:04.180]  Dr. Bronner's made soap out of it.
[27:04.180 --> 27:05.420]  No shit.
[27:05.420 --> 27:07.540]  I think it was bought before it was harvested.
[27:07.540 --> 27:08.460]  Oh, I wouldn't doubt that.
[27:08.660 --> 27:10.580]  Which is how you know you're doing a good job.
[27:10.580 --> 27:11.420]  Yeah.
[27:11.420 --> 27:12.540]  I've had a crop like that before.
[27:16.740 --> 27:20.740]  How do we fight hypocrisy that's going on within the state?
[27:20.740 --> 27:24.220]  So we often see there's the,
[27:24.220 --> 27:26.020]  every time I see an alcohol ad,
[27:27.660 --> 27:29.260]  and at the same time see someone,
[27:29.260 --> 27:32.780]  or anytime I see someone like drink a glass of wine
[27:32.780 --> 27:35.300]  and then say marijuana's bad.
[27:35.300 --> 27:36.140]  Right.
[27:36.140 --> 27:37.100]  Shit like that drives me nuts.
[27:37.100 --> 27:37.940]  Me too.
[27:38.340 --> 27:39.540]  We have bars that are polluted.
[27:39.540 --> 27:41.100]  I'm a dick when I'm drunk.
[27:41.100 --> 27:43.740]  But I mean, our town is polluted with bars.
[27:44.700 --> 27:47.980]  We have more bars than we could ever possibly need.
[27:48.820 --> 27:50.140]  We do.
[27:50.140 --> 27:50.980]  Absolutely.
[27:52.140 --> 27:56.020]  Which, how much collateral damage
[27:56.020 --> 27:57.580]  do you think comes from a bar?
[27:57.580 --> 27:58.820]  One bar.
[27:58.820 --> 28:03.420]  DUIs, babies, fights, divorces, deaths.
[28:03.420 --> 28:04.900]  Yeah, I've lost more than one friend
[28:04.940 --> 28:08.500]  from leaving the same bar in separate occasions.
[28:10.820 --> 28:11.660]  You're reading my mind.
[28:11.660 --> 28:12.500]  Oh yeah.
[28:12.500 --> 28:13.340]  I'm not talking about,
[28:13.340 --> 28:14.180]  but I'm not gonna say any names on our show.
[28:14.180 --> 28:17.660]  I've got the same issues.
[28:17.660 --> 28:20.900]  I've got a friend that's took a bullet
[28:20.900 --> 28:23.180]  through his left arm and it went into his heart
[28:23.180 --> 28:25.020]  because he helped bouncers kick some rough dudes
[28:25.020 --> 28:25.860]  out of a bar.
[28:27.700 --> 28:29.460]  I worked in the bars all my life.
[28:29.460 --> 28:32.620]  Like I look, here's a stat that I wanna know,
[28:32.620 --> 28:34.380]  just being a bartender.
[28:34.380 --> 28:39.380]  How many unwanted pregnancies am I responsible for?
[28:40.300 --> 28:41.700]  Like on a Friday night?
[28:41.700 --> 28:42.540]  How many-
[28:42.540 --> 28:45.140]  That's at Wade in the toilet for the I Grow Cultures.
[28:45.140 --> 28:47.340]  Yes, that's my buddy Wade.
[28:47.340 --> 28:48.620]  That's who I hang out with.
[28:48.620 --> 28:49.460]  Yeah, right?
[28:49.460 --> 28:50.300]  That's the guy.
[28:50.300 --> 28:51.260]  That's the, yeah, sorry.
[28:51.260 --> 28:52.980]  Well, not only that, but how many,
[28:52.980 --> 28:55.420]  so check it out, here's Pueblo history.
[28:55.420 --> 28:58.540]  And here's a little slice of Pueblo bar history for you.
[28:58.540 --> 29:01.780]  This is, and it's interesting that we come
[29:01.780 --> 29:03.940]  to this type of precipice, I guess.
[29:05.380 --> 29:06.580]  I like that vocabulary.
[29:06.580 --> 29:08.940]  Keep going, because we've only got 20 more minutes
[29:08.940 --> 29:10.020]  and we wanna get more of Gary on.
[29:10.020 --> 29:10.860]  Correct.
[29:13.180 --> 29:15.540]  There was a couple of young ladies that drove their vehicle.
[29:15.540 --> 29:16.980]  I'm gonna give him a dab, so if you hear a cop,
[29:16.980 --> 29:18.260]  it's this guy.
[29:18.260 --> 29:19.700]  I wasn't gonna go there on the show.
[29:19.700 --> 29:20.780]  I wasn't gonna go there where you're going.
[29:20.780 --> 29:21.700]  Is that who you're talking about?
[29:21.700 --> 29:22.540]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was talking about.
[29:22.540 --> 29:23.380]  Oh, is it really?
[29:23.380 --> 29:24.620]  But that's a sensitive subject, right?
[29:24.620 --> 29:25.460]  That's people's kids.
[29:25.460 --> 29:26.940]  I wasn't gonna go there.
[29:26.940 --> 29:27.900]  Oh, really?
[29:27.900 --> 29:28.740]  You can if you'd like to talk about it.
[29:28.740 --> 29:30.020]  Well, no, no, no, we don't have to.
[29:30.020 --> 29:31.180]  I didn't know that was the same one
[29:31.180 --> 29:32.020]  that we were talking about.
[29:32.020 --> 29:32.860]  That's who I was talking about,
[29:32.860 --> 29:34.380]  the one that we've lost leaving the bar.
[29:34.380 --> 29:36.460]  Like, that's that carload of girls
[29:36.460 --> 29:37.300]  was exactly what I was talking about.
[29:37.300 --> 29:38.460]  Well, you know, I got like-
[29:38.460 --> 29:39.860]  I was just gonna leave it out of the show.
[29:39.860 --> 29:41.220]  Investigated for that shit.
[29:41.220 --> 29:42.060]  Oh, really?
[29:42.060 --> 29:42.900]  Yeah.
[29:42.900 --> 29:43.740]  Well, yeah, because I mean,
[29:43.740 --> 29:44.580]  they left a bar where you were serving.
[29:44.580 --> 29:45.420]  Yeah.
[29:45.420 --> 29:46.260]  Or I don't know if you were serving
[29:46.260 --> 29:47.100]  or you're attached to.
[29:47.100 --> 29:47.940]  Yeah.
[29:47.940 --> 29:48.780]  Wow.
[29:48.780 --> 29:51.500]  And we had to show like video evidence,
[29:51.500 --> 29:53.460]  video evidence that was like,
[29:53.460 --> 29:55.300]  this is what time they were here.
[29:55.300 --> 29:57.460]  This is what we were responsible for.
[29:57.460 --> 29:58.580]  Okay.
[29:58.580 --> 30:01.340]  And then there's only a couple of other details.
[30:01.340 --> 30:03.380]  There's only one detail that I will not,
[30:03.380 --> 30:06.380]  I won't give that up because it's a detail that is public.
[30:07.900 --> 30:09.020]  But in that detail,
[30:09.020 --> 30:11.020]  that's the only thing that basically saved me
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.380]  and another bar who I won't say
[30:13.380 --> 30:15.260]  from getting in a lot of trouble.
[30:16.500 --> 30:18.100]  A lot of bars in this town
[30:18.100 --> 30:20.580]  don't take a lot of responsibility, bro.
[30:20.580 --> 30:21.780]  At all.
[30:21.780 --> 30:22.620]  At all.
[30:24.020 --> 30:25.980]  We can name so many.
[30:25.980 --> 30:27.260]  I'm proud that I don't drink anymore,
[30:27.260 --> 30:28.100]  but when I did drink,
[30:28.100 --> 30:29.420]  there would be plenty of bartenders
[30:29.460 --> 30:31.780]  who were ready just to over serve me.
[30:31.780 --> 30:32.620]  Because when you're drunk,
[30:32.620 --> 30:35.180]  you tip well and they build that relationship with you.
[30:35.180 --> 30:36.580]  You buddy up with the bartender.
[30:36.580 --> 30:37.420]  Oh yeah.
[30:37.420 --> 30:38.260]  You know?
[30:38.260 --> 30:40.940]  Dude, this is how we basically know each other.
[30:40.940 --> 30:43.420]  This is how people know me in this town.
[30:43.420 --> 30:44.260]  I know Wade Ridley
[30:44.260 --> 30:45.620]  from when I used to manage a bowling alley.
[30:45.620 --> 30:46.820]  I was 19 years old.
[30:46.820 --> 30:47.660]  That's right.
[30:47.660 --> 30:48.500]  Bowling.
[30:49.380 --> 30:51.140]  I'm gonna drop your mic out for a second, Gary.
[30:51.140 --> 30:51.980]  You're cool.
[30:51.980 --> 30:52.820]  Cough away.
[30:54.060 --> 30:56.220]  Oh, there's a lot of noise on his mic.
[30:56.220 --> 30:57.100]  I've just got him gamed up.
[30:57.100 --> 30:59.140]  Can you, can't hear you anymore?
[30:59.900 --> 31:00.660]  Well, you're in the recording.
[31:02.780 --> 31:03.900]  Keep going.
[31:03.900 --> 31:04.740]  So anyway.
[31:04.740 --> 31:05.580]  Oh, you just dropped out too.
[31:05.580 --> 31:06.860]  Where'd you go?
[31:06.860 --> 31:07.700]  I don't hear you in there.
[31:07.700 --> 31:08.660]  Well, sorry guys, Wade dropped out.
[31:08.660 --> 31:10.940]  I gotta do the show by myself.
[31:10.940 --> 31:11.780]  That's fucking weird.
[31:11.780 --> 31:12.940]  I don't know what happened.
[31:12.940 --> 31:14.500]  Check one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[31:14.500 --> 31:16.100]  One, two, there's Wade.
[31:16.100 --> 31:16.940]  I found you.
[31:16.940 --> 31:17.780]  I know what happened.
[31:17.780 --> 31:18.700]  Hi guys.
[31:18.700 --> 31:19.540]  So.
[31:19.540 --> 31:20.380]  Sorry guys.
[31:20.380 --> 31:21.460]  We have one tech issue every show.
[31:21.460 --> 31:23.300]  So I'm fucking happy with life.
[31:23.300 --> 31:24.140]  It's all good.
[31:24.140 --> 31:25.700]  I'm taking pads and having fun.
[31:25.700 --> 31:28.260]  Yeah, and having a serious discussion at the same time.
[31:28.300 --> 31:29.820]  Welcome to the Agro Culture Podcast guys.
[31:29.820 --> 31:31.100]  This is a new format for us.
[31:31.100 --> 31:32.220]  We're just going to do this this one time.
[31:32.220 --> 31:33.420]  So please bear with us.
[31:35.420 --> 31:36.780]  It's way different than what we normally do.
[31:36.780 --> 31:39.060]  So I don't want to scare my friends away.
[31:39.060 --> 31:39.900]  Oh, okay.
[31:39.900 --> 31:40.860]  No problem.
[31:40.860 --> 31:41.700]  What would you like to do?
[31:41.700 --> 31:42.540]  No, no, keep going.
[31:42.540 --> 31:43.380]  Keep going.
[31:43.380 --> 31:44.200]  I want them to,
[31:44.200 --> 31:45.180]  they're going to get some 719 the blocks taste
[31:45.180 --> 31:46.020]  while they're at it.
[31:46.020 --> 31:50.140]  So there is so much,
[31:52.980 --> 31:53.820]  I don't want to,
[31:53.820 --> 31:57.900]  I don't want to say there's so much bad attached to alcohol
[31:58.740 --> 32:02.700]  along with the supposed good,
[32:02.700 --> 32:03.660]  the mirror good.
[32:03.660 --> 32:04.500]  Like you're drinking,
[32:04.500 --> 32:05.340]  you're having fun.
[32:05.340 --> 32:07.580]  You're dancing and there's Mexican music going real fast.
[32:07.580 --> 32:08.420]  Lots of congas.
[32:08.420 --> 32:09.580]  Lots of short skirts.
[32:09.580 --> 32:10.420]  So.
[32:10.420 --> 32:11.260]  Yeah, right.
[32:11.260 --> 32:12.080]  But I mean,
[32:12.080 --> 32:12.920]  you're talking to girls.
[32:12.920 --> 32:13.760]  Girls are talking to.
[32:13.760 --> 32:14.580]  But that's.
[32:14.580 --> 32:15.420]  Wait, okay.
[32:15.420 --> 32:16.260]  Okay.
[32:16.260 --> 32:17.080]  Uncouth.
[32:17.080 --> 32:17.920]  That's right.
[32:17.920 --> 32:18.760]  At Rasta Jeff.
[32:18.760 --> 32:19.580]  Yep.
[32:19.580 --> 32:20.420]  Yep.
[32:20.420 --> 32:21.260]  I'm like it's sued for that shit.
[32:21.260 --> 32:22.080]  I said,
[32:22.080 --> 32:22.920]  no seconds and car wreck.
[32:22.920 --> 32:23.760]  Oh, right.
[32:23.760 --> 32:24.580]  Together.
[32:24.820 --> 32:27.660]  We don't have that type of environment with the marijuana
[32:27.660 --> 32:28.500]  culture.
[32:28.500 --> 32:31.500]  It seems like even in the reefer madness back in the day,
[32:31.500 --> 32:32.340]  marijuana is like,
[32:32.340 --> 32:33.180]  I'm losing my mind.
[32:33.180 --> 32:35.620]  Like we should know a pothead because you guys are fucking
[32:35.620 --> 32:36.460]  crazy lunatics.
[32:36.460 --> 32:39.460]  We get dabbed out and rape white bitches.
[32:39.460 --> 32:41.060]  But now I rusted Jeff,
[32:41.060 --> 32:42.380]  but now I'm like,
[32:42.380 --> 32:43.220]  I'm like,
[32:43.220 --> 32:44.060]  I'm like,
[32:44.060 --> 32:44.880]  I'm like,
[32:44.880 --> 32:45.720]  I'm like,
[32:45.720 --> 32:46.560]  I'm like,
[32:46.560 --> 32:47.380]  I'm like,
[32:47.380 --> 32:48.220]  I'm like,
[32:48.220 --> 32:49.060]  I'm like,
[32:49.060 --> 32:49.880]  I'm like,
[32:49.880 --> 32:50.720]  I'm like,
[32:50.720 --> 32:51.560]  I'm like,
[32:51.560 --> 32:52.380]  I'm like,
[32:52.380 --> 32:53.220]  I'm like,
[32:53.220 --> 32:54.060]  I'm like,
[32:55.020 --> 32:57.200]  I'm like what?
[32:57.200 --> 33:00.980]  We're seeing that marijuana is like helping little children,
[33:02.120 --> 33:04.420]  like caring little children,
[33:04.420 --> 33:07.100]  little children running and Gleen's Skippy.
[33:07.100 --> 33:08.540]  That's what we need is doing.
[33:09.820 --> 33:10.840]  To be more.
[33:10.840 --> 33:12.180]  When I clear that up a little bit,
[33:12.180 --> 33:13.020]  cause there's,
[33:13.020 --> 33:14.040]  there needs to be some backgrounds.
[33:14.040 --> 33:15.580]  So you didn't mention to these little kids that are given
[33:15.580 --> 33:17.660]  cannabis,
[33:17.660 --> 33:18.640]  do you have cancer or something?
[33:18.640 --> 33:19.980]  You're just saying that there's little children,
[33:19.980 --> 33:20.820]  running and skipping.
[33:20.820 --> 33:22.360]  We're not just getting little kids.
[33:22.360 --> 33:24.960]  No, well, and I don't mean it in that way.
[33:24.960 --> 33:25.460]  Yeah.
[33:25.460 --> 33:28.080]  And these little kids have seizures all day long,
[33:28.080 --> 33:30.080]  or don't eat, or have a debilitating condition.
[33:30.080 --> 33:32.480]  When you give them cancer, it cures, not cures,
[33:32.480 --> 33:34.480]  it helps them deal and cope with that stuff.
[33:34.480 --> 33:36.600]  These little kids that have cancer, they don't eat.
[33:36.600 --> 33:37.100]  Correct.
[33:37.100 --> 33:39.260]  The medication they make makes them wither away.
[33:39.260 --> 33:42.640]  And then you feed Brave Mikaela a lollipop of cannabis in it,
[33:42.640 --> 33:43.560]  and she dances around.
[33:43.560 --> 33:45.480]  She may get a little bit of a buzz from it,
[33:45.480 --> 33:45.840]  but you know what?
[33:45.840 --> 33:47.960]  She's living, and she doesn't wither away.
[33:47.960 --> 33:48.460]  My dad.
[33:48.460 --> 33:49.660]  She feels like a child again.
[33:49.660 --> 33:51.400]  Show that video to my dad.
[33:51.740 --> 33:53.140]  Check out Brave Mikaela, you guys.
[33:53.140 --> 33:54.180]  I really do.
[33:54.180 --> 33:55.420]  It'll put a tear in your eye.
[33:55.420 --> 33:57.260]  If you're a grown man, you'll cry from that.
[33:57.260 --> 33:58.220]  That's what I'm saying.
[33:58.220 --> 34:00.500]  Before you do, make sure to grab some Kleenex,
[34:00.500 --> 34:04.220]  call a support group, and get a gallon of Rocky Road,
[34:04.220 --> 34:05.940]  because it is a journey.
[34:05.940 --> 34:07.860]  My friend Wade's kind of a pansy.
[34:07.860 --> 34:10.460]  Kind of is an understatement when it comes to movies.
[34:10.460 --> 34:11.800]  All right, we've got about, if you
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.820]  want to leave at the time you said,
[34:12.820 --> 34:13.980]  we've got about 15 minutes.
[34:13.980 --> 34:16.100]  So let's let Gary say anything he'd like to say.
[34:16.100 --> 34:17.620]  Let's put him on the spotlight.
[34:17.620 --> 34:20.500]  What's up, Gary?
[34:20.500 --> 34:21.340]  What you doing, Gary?
[34:21.340 --> 34:22.320]  Now we put him on the spotlight.
[34:22.320 --> 34:22.880]  He went numb.
[34:22.880 --> 34:24.400]  Hey, thanks for knocking that over, Gary.
[34:24.400 --> 34:25.040]  Whatever, though.
[34:25.040 --> 34:25.760]  We gave him a dab.
[34:25.760 --> 34:26.640]  Don't talk about it.
[34:26.640 --> 34:27.640]  You got anything to say?
[34:27.640 --> 34:28.140]  I'm good.
[34:28.140 --> 34:28.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[34:28.640 --> 34:32.560]  So you said, Wade said it earlier.
[34:32.560 --> 34:33.520]  He addressed us.
[34:33.520 --> 34:36.160]  He said, I want to discuss the state of weed in Colorado.
[34:36.160 --> 34:37.820]  So we've talked about how the finances,
[34:37.820 --> 34:39.440]  and it's going to be global.
[34:39.440 --> 34:42.280]  We've talked about finances and how we see global growth.
[34:42.280 --> 34:43.780]  What else do you see coming from it?
[34:43.780 --> 34:44.820]  What else do you predict?
[34:44.820 --> 34:47.560]  Since you're a thinker, bro, you're a far thinker,
[34:47.560 --> 34:50.960]  I think, like you said, you work for a guy that grows.
[34:50.980 --> 34:52.420]  I'm too focused on the grow, and I
[34:52.420 --> 34:55.820]  slip on a lot of the things, the logistics that you're good at.
[34:55.820 --> 34:58.300]  So what are your predictions, since you
[34:58.300 --> 35:00.660]  seem to see a lot more clear image of what's
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.020]  going on than I do?
[35:02.020 --> 35:03.980]  Well, I don't know.
[35:03.980 --> 35:05.900]  My guess is as good as anybody else's, right?
[35:05.900 --> 35:07.380]  But I do follow things.
[35:07.380 --> 35:08.860]  I do watch the news.
[35:08.860 --> 35:11.940]  And as part of my studies, I kind of
[35:11.940 --> 35:15.620]  did a review of the media coverage on the rollout.
[35:15.620 --> 35:18.980]  As a final project for my last, I do two classes
[35:19.000 --> 35:30.360]  every eight weeks, was to look at the media coverage
[35:30.360 --> 35:40.250]  from November 1, 2013, to March 2014,
[35:40.250 --> 35:48.030]  the rollout of Legalize.
[35:48.030 --> 35:49.710]  See how the media depicted it.
[35:49.710 --> 35:55.510]  And the principles we focused on during this class
[35:55.510 --> 36:00.740]  were how the media serves to recreate.
[36:00.740 --> 36:02.540]  It tells you the same story over and over,
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.540]  so you keep believing.
[36:03.540 --> 36:04.820]  OK.
[36:04.820 --> 36:13.100]  How you know, that's what we're looking at.
[36:13.100 --> 36:16.640]  All the stories they released during that time period,
[36:16.640 --> 36:30.060]  and how those stories depict the legalization of the BBC, CNN,
[36:30.060 --> 36:32.300]  and Fox News.
[36:32.300 --> 36:35.100]  So what I predicted, and what my thesis was for the whole
[36:35.100 --> 36:37.700]  project, is I'm going to see it divided,
[36:37.700 --> 36:47.920]  where CNN, and the BBC, as usual,
[36:47.920 --> 36:49.560]  is going to be more neutral.
[36:49.560 --> 36:50.560]  Right?
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.520]  But they just, uh.
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.280]  Totally wrong.
[36:53.280 --> 36:54.040]  Really?
[36:54.040 --> 36:54.600]  What was it?
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.400]  Totally wrong.
[36:55.420 --> 36:56.540]  Was the BBC liberal?
[36:56.540 --> 37:00.180]  I found one negative story.
[37:00.180 --> 37:01.620]  And it was on CNN.
[37:01.620 --> 37:03.700]  And it was an op-ed piece.
[37:03.700 --> 37:06.580]  All the op-ed pieces, and Fox, and I went ahead
[37:06.580 --> 37:08.420]  and looked at Forbes too, because I wasn't
[37:08.420 --> 37:09.580]  believing what I was seeing.
[37:09.580 --> 37:10.380]  Yeah, why not?
[37:10.380 --> 37:11.660]  Same with Forbes.
[37:11.660 --> 37:16.980]  All the op-ed pieces were like some conservative libertarian
[37:16.980 --> 37:19.460]  talking about why drugs should be legal,
[37:19.460 --> 37:23.500]  all drugs should be legal, why the war on drugs isn't working,
[37:23.500 --> 37:25.260]  why it's a waste of money.
[37:26.160 --> 37:31.220]  Even on Fox News?
[37:31.220 --> 37:31.940]  Not on Fox News.
[37:31.940 --> 37:35.260]  Not even that lady who said the NAACP champions?
[37:35.260 --> 37:36.980]  Well, I'm talking about the stories
[37:36.980 --> 37:40.460]  that InPrint released on their website in that time period.
[37:40.460 --> 37:41.620]  Not one negative story.
[37:41.620 --> 37:44.220]  Now what you're saying on the air is a different thing, right?
[37:44.220 --> 37:45.620]  Nancy Grace talked a lot of shit,
[37:45.620 --> 37:47.540]  but it was all on the air, it wasn't in print.
[37:47.540 --> 37:48.420]  But that was CNN too.
[37:48.420 --> 37:48.920]  Yeah.
[37:48.920 --> 37:50.180]  She's CNN.
[37:50.180 --> 37:51.380]  She's HLN, Nancy Grace.
[37:51.380 --> 37:52.780]  Yeah, but that's a CNN company.
[37:52.780 --> 37:53.260]  Oh, I see.
[37:53.260 --> 37:54.740]  She did the subsidiary as well.
[37:54.740 --> 37:55.980]  I get it.
[37:55.980 --> 37:57.220]  So it's odd.
[37:57.220 --> 37:57.860]  You know?
[37:57.880 --> 38:06.280]  I think it's over with, man.
[38:06.280 --> 38:11.240]  The written stories are not reflecting negatively at all.
[38:11.240 --> 38:14.200]  So when you say, what the fuck?
[38:14.200 --> 38:18.100]  That made me mad as fuck.
[38:18.100 --> 38:19.380]  That really makes me upset.
[38:19.380 --> 38:21.180]  I have to spend the last half of my project
[38:21.180 --> 38:22.620]  explaining why I was wrong.
[38:22.620 --> 38:25.820]  Well, you're talking about, one is Fox News.
[38:25.820 --> 38:27.980]  Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
[38:27.980 --> 38:31.580]  Rupert Murdoch is literally like a very Republican.
[38:31.580 --> 38:33.420]  If there were a version of Republican,
[38:33.420 --> 38:34.900]  that's Rupert Murdoch.
[38:35.160 --> 38:40.440]  Conservative-based, like Fox News represents his will.
[38:40.440 --> 38:45.240]  But being a billionaire, he also has that libertarian bent.
[38:45.240 --> 38:46.000]  But that's cool.
[38:46.000 --> 38:46.600]  That's cool.
[38:46.600 --> 38:48.360]  But what I'm saying is, when it breaks down
[38:48.360 --> 38:50.000]  all the way to the local level, though,
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.320]  when it breaks down to our level,
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.920]  and we open up our fuck-face, shitty newspaper,
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.840]  agro-culture does not represent the opinions
[38:57.840 --> 38:58.800]  of Wade and the toilet.
[39:01.520 --> 39:04.600]  So when we open up this fucking newspaper,
[39:04.620 --> 39:07.580]  we have so many pieces still in our newspaper,
[39:07.580 --> 39:09.660]  our local newspaper, that say,
[39:09.660 --> 39:11.860]  weed is bad, weed sucks, we're dying,
[39:11.860 --> 39:14.860]  this is the reason why it's all going downhill.
[39:14.860 --> 39:20.220]  So that's local, hard-headed, old school, old establishment,
[39:20.220 --> 39:22.500]  liquor store owners, tavern owners
[39:22.500 --> 39:24.140]  that don't like that shit, man.
[39:24.140 --> 39:25.380]  Why would they?
[39:25.380 --> 39:26.540]  You know?
[39:26.540 --> 39:27.900]  Think about it.
[39:27.900 --> 39:30.260]  The same thing's gonna happen with the paper companies,
[39:30.260 --> 39:32.340]  the timber companies, excuse me,
[39:32.340 --> 39:33.500]  when hemp rolls.
[39:33.500 --> 39:34.340]  Gets legalized.
[39:34.360 --> 39:36.360]  And that's gonna get bloody, because they're
[39:36.360 --> 39:41.080]  gonna move jobs offshore, it's gonna be bad.
[39:41.080 --> 39:42.320]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:42.320 --> 39:44.760]  Move jobs offshore from Colorado?
[39:44.760 --> 39:46.680]  Well, if you can't cut timber here,
[39:46.680 --> 39:47.880]  you're gonna cut timber somewhere,
[39:47.880 --> 39:49.440]  because that's what you do is you cut timber.
[39:49.440 --> 39:51.080]  That's something else I wanted to ask you about.
[39:51.080 --> 39:52.480]  Since you're working at a dispensary now,
[39:52.480 --> 39:54.920]  and you're helping this guy set up his stuff,
[39:54.920 --> 39:58.560]  do you see cannabis shortages happening in locations?
[39:58.560 --> 40:00.920]  Yeah, well, there was an article yesterday
[40:00.920 --> 40:04.280]  that I was reading about, it was in the High Times,
[40:05.220 --> 40:06.500]  and it was about how the black market's
[40:06.500 --> 40:08.660]  still thriving in Colorado.
[40:08.660 --> 40:16.210]  And that's the whole thing, right?
[40:16.210 --> 40:19.050]  And weed is so ubiquitous that people
[40:19.050 --> 40:22.370]  just get it off the street cheaper, without the tax.
[40:22.370 --> 40:29.230]  So until you deregulate that enough,
[40:29.230 --> 40:37.110]  you're gonna, the black market's gonna remain.
[40:37.110 --> 40:39.550]  Yeah, I was driving yesterday, I ended up out of town,
[40:39.550 --> 40:42.030]  and realized that the people I was partying with,
[40:42.030 --> 40:43.910]  I was gonna need more dabs than I had available
[40:43.910 --> 40:46.390]  with me at the time, I only traveled lightly.
[40:46.390 --> 40:48.310]  And so I hit up Facebook, and I said,
[40:48.330 --> 40:51.930]  hey, I'm gonna be in Denver, I need a gram or two of Shatter.
[40:51.930 --> 40:53.650]  Are there any recreational shops around
[40:53.650 --> 40:55.130]  that you'd recommend?
[40:55.130 --> 40:56.490]  I just wanted to check out a rec shop
[40:56.490 --> 40:58.450]  if I had the opportunity, I've been in plenty
[40:58.450 --> 41:00.930]  of legal shops, or med shops, I was actually
[41:00.930 --> 41:03.010]  the first person to buy rec weed in Pueblo,
[41:03.010 --> 41:06.970]  at the greener side, but before I could blink,
[41:06.970 --> 41:09.410]  there were several posts from friends of mine,
[41:09.410 --> 41:11.450]  like saying, pretty much, fuck the dispensaries,
[41:11.450 --> 41:14.050]  come to my house, and I got you covered.
[41:14.050 --> 41:16.530]  I got some really great Shatter from two friends,
[41:16.530 --> 41:17.850]  and they'd rather remain nameless,
[41:18.350 --> 41:19.410]  but you guys listen to the show, so shout out,
[41:19.410 --> 41:22.590]  thank you guys, these two grams are delicious.
[41:22.590 --> 41:24.830]  And then the green dot that somebody hooked me up with,
[41:24.830 --> 41:27.730]  green dot, you guys do a fucking hell of a job, dude.
[41:27.730 --> 41:31.710]  That is some clear, oh, it smells so good.
[41:31.710 --> 41:34.150]  The flavor, hey, shout out, we're doing two shows at once,
[41:34.150 --> 41:37.190]  so shout out to Solomon, who made my little mini rigs here.
[41:37.190 --> 41:39.230]  Yeah. Those little mini dab rigs.
[41:39.230 --> 41:42.630]  Dude, you did a great job, red, gold, and green roster rigs.
[41:42.630 --> 41:45.550]  I love them, they hit like a boss.
[41:45.570 --> 41:48.530]  That one fucked me up last night after comedy works.
[41:48.530 --> 41:51.370]  Ray's looking at my rig like he's intimidated by it.
[41:51.370 --> 41:52.970]  It's like if Mike Tyson walked in the room,
[41:52.970 --> 41:54.810]  Ray just gave my rig the same look, like,
[41:54.810 --> 41:56.530]  don't hurt me, don't hurt me.
[41:56.530 --> 41:57.890]  It's like when you go to hug someone,
[41:57.890 --> 41:58.930]  and you're like, I gotta make sure
[41:58.930 --> 42:00.890]  this motherfucker can't fuck me up, you know?
[42:00.890 --> 42:03.370]  You're just kinda like, hey, all right, all right,
[42:03.370 --> 42:05.530]  you got a little flabby on the arm, we're okay.
[42:05.530 --> 42:06.730]  You gotta respect the mini tubes.
[42:06.730 --> 42:09.330]  Yeah, that fucking thing fucked my shit up proper
[42:09.330 --> 42:10.290]  last night, man.
[42:13.090 --> 42:14.610]  What's the next step for me?
[42:14.950 --> 42:17.190]  He said global, I'm scared now, that's kinda weird.
[42:17.190 --> 42:18.710]  So we're gonna have, it's already global, right?
[42:18.710 --> 42:20.130]  They're already growing across the world
[42:20.130 --> 42:23.590]  in foresty, jungly type places where cannabis is from.
[42:24.430 --> 42:27.590]  That could be beneficial and problematic for the industry.
[42:27.590 --> 42:31.550]  Well, if it's completely legalized,
[42:31.550 --> 42:34.510]  let's say people are like, oh,
[42:34.510 --> 42:38.070]  that was all bullshit they were talking about,
[42:38.070 --> 42:40.110]  and it's fully accepted marijuana.
[42:40.110 --> 42:41.830]  What's the next step for it?
[42:41.850 --> 42:44.730]  What can be, what's the next step for Colorado?
[42:44.730 --> 42:47.090]  If we're pioneering and leading the way
[42:47.090 --> 42:50.410]  in this cannabis culture, in y'all's opinion,
[42:50.410 --> 42:55.250]  what is the next step for not only Colorado?
[42:55.250 --> 42:56.970]  One small thing I'd like to see happen
[42:56.970 --> 42:59.650]  is reinstate things or re,
[42:59.650 --> 43:01.650]  they've outlawed things like the ganja gourmet,
[43:01.650 --> 43:03.610]  and if you don't know about the ganja gourmet,
[43:03.610 --> 43:06.130]  you used to be able to go to this restaurant,
[43:06.130 --> 43:08.890]  and you would sit at a little bar type seating area,
[43:08.890 --> 43:10.770]  and they had a couple tables in the back area,
[43:10.770 --> 43:12.330]  and you could smoke cannabis in there.
[43:12.330 --> 43:14.590]  They would offer you a joint or a bar,
[43:14.590 --> 43:15.470]  whatever, when you walked in.
[43:15.470 --> 43:17.430]  They had a little counter that was a dispensary,
[43:17.430 --> 43:20.590]  so you could buy, they just had good weed, good flowers.
[43:20.590 --> 43:22.270]  They had seven or eight strains at a decent price.
[43:22.270 --> 43:24.230]  I think it was 45 or 50 and eighth,
[43:24.230 --> 43:25.910]  and it had taxes included because it's,
[43:25.910 --> 43:26.990]  for sure it went weird.
[43:26.990 --> 43:28.350]  You're paying 45 or 50 and eighth,
[43:28.350 --> 43:29.750]  and then you'd sit down and order a meal,
[43:29.750 --> 43:32.070]  and everything in your meal would have weed in it.
[43:32.070 --> 43:33.350]  It would all be medicated.
[43:33.350 --> 43:34.270]  Ooh.
[43:34.270 --> 43:36.070]  Ganja temponade and ganja pizzas.
[43:36.070 --> 43:38.430]  And that got out, okay, so I can understand
[43:38.430 --> 43:39.790]  why that got out, though. Ganja cheesecakes.
[43:39.790 --> 43:43.090]  I got high as giraffe pussy, Joe Rogan.
[43:43.090 --> 43:45.410]  I got high as giraffe pussy in that restaurant.
[43:45.410 --> 43:47.090]  I didn't even realize it.
[43:47.090 --> 43:47.970]  You're just fucked.
[43:47.970 --> 43:50.130]  But they bring you a joint before your meal.
[43:50.130 --> 43:50.970]  You eat your meal.
[43:50.970 --> 43:51.810]  Little appetizer, man.
[43:51.810 --> 43:54.050]  They bring you a joint, and then you eat dessert,
[43:54.050 --> 43:56.050]  and I smoked that joint after my meal
[43:56.050 --> 43:58.110]  and thought I should pee before dessert, you know?
[43:58.110 --> 43:59.730]  Just get a little fresher.
[43:59.730 --> 44:02.850]  In the bathroom, I realized the bathroom is melting,
[44:02.850 --> 44:04.330]  and I walked out, and I looked at my girlfriend
[44:04.330 --> 44:05.410]  that was with me at the time, and I was like,
[44:05.410 --> 44:06.930]  babe, and she goes, we gotta go,
[44:06.930 --> 44:08.850]  and I was like, uh-huh, and so we had to make
[44:08.870 --> 44:11.910]  a two-hour trek from Denver, a little bit intoxicated.
[44:11.910 --> 44:12.750]  It was a journey.
[44:12.750 --> 44:15.630]  I'm glad she's a pro, because she was driving that night.
[44:15.630 --> 44:17.950]  It was great, but we need to get things like that back.
[44:17.950 --> 44:19.830]  That would be great, because you can't do that now.
[44:19.830 --> 44:21.550]  That's a little, they can serve it,
[44:21.550 --> 44:23.350]  and you can take it home, but they can't sell it
[44:23.350 --> 44:26.750]  to you edible, hot there, and you can't consume it on site.
[44:26.750 --> 44:28.050]  And that was half the fun.
[44:29.630 --> 44:31.630]  I could see half the reason for that, maybe,
[44:31.630 --> 44:33.390]  because that's a health issue type of thing.
[44:33.390 --> 44:35.150]  Well, and it's also, well, you could do it,
[44:35.150 --> 44:37.670]  there are certified MMED kitchens now.
[44:37.670 --> 44:38.510]  Correct.
[44:39.090 --> 44:40.090]  They could do it just like that,
[44:40.090 --> 44:40.930]  but part of the problem is,
[44:40.930 --> 44:43.650]  then you're driving out of there high.
[44:43.650 --> 44:46.330]  Like, I was high, and I'm a professional.
[44:46.330 --> 44:48.650]  I smoke more than anybody else I hang out with.
[44:48.650 --> 44:50.250]  I mean, I've got access to this,
[44:50.250 --> 44:52.010]  and I was high when I left there.
[44:53.370 --> 44:54.610]  So let me bring up this,
[44:55.590 --> 44:59.090]  check out Pueblo Cannabis Enthusiasts on Facebook,
[45:00.130 --> 45:06.720]  and some ground support for a private smoking club in Pueblo.
[45:07.080 --> 45:08.600]  Ooh.
[45:08.620 --> 45:11.020]  So I've got a partner who's working with me,
[45:12.020 --> 45:15.940]  and we're at the point where we're scouting locations.
[45:15.940 --> 45:18.140]  We've already checked out the zoning and stuff like that,
[45:18.140 --> 45:19.260]  and we're moving forward.
[45:19.260 --> 45:24.970]  We're trying to get, you know.
[45:24.970 --> 45:26.450]  Definitely be interesting around here.
[45:26.450 --> 45:28.130]  So please check us out on Facebook,
[45:28.130 --> 45:29.210]  and I'll keep you posted about stuff.
[45:29.210 --> 45:30.410]  Yeah, 100%.
[45:30.410 --> 45:33.570]  I repost all these articles that I'm mentioning.
[45:33.570 --> 45:36.950]  Every time I read them, I repost.
[45:36.950 --> 45:37.790]  News there.
[45:37.790 --> 45:38.990]  Great, I can use a lot of news.
[45:38.990 --> 45:42.240]  Yeah.
[45:42.240 --> 45:45.480]  Shout out to Patrick and George for giving some likes
[45:45.580 --> 45:49.020]  and some comments on this little,
[45:49.020 --> 45:50.500]  that's my first ever selfie.
[45:50.500 --> 45:53.460]  Wade's taking selfies, you guys,
[45:53.460 --> 45:54.980]  on the Agro Culture Podcast.
[45:54.980 --> 45:57.780]  Hey, man, it's for 719 the Blocks, man.
[45:57.780 --> 45:59.740]  You got, I grew up culture.
[45:59.740 --> 46:01.140]  I've listened to the first two, man.
[46:01.140 --> 46:03.980]  It's, you guys got some good flow, man.
[46:03.980 --> 46:04.820]  We're trying.
[46:04.820 --> 46:07.780]  It's, I'll probably have Kevin over later tonight,
[46:07.780 --> 46:10.060]  and he'll probably record a little bit with me also.
[46:10.060 --> 46:11.820]  Kind of piece this one into that one.
[46:11.820 --> 46:12.660]  Nice.
[46:12.660 --> 46:14.380]  You know, I was thinking,
[46:14.400 --> 46:22.780]  and maybe you can ask him.
[46:22.780 --> 46:23.860]  I'm just gonna keep recording.
[46:23.860 --> 46:25.340]  Yeah, we'll just talk for a while.
[46:25.340 --> 46:26.660]  Because there's a lot of shit I want to ask you.
[46:26.660 --> 46:27.660]  We may as well record it.
[46:27.660 --> 46:28.500]  Yeah, that sounds great.
[46:28.500 --> 46:29.500]  Hey, I'm dipping out, though.
[46:29.500 --> 46:30.740]  Are you gonna, you want to dab before you go?
[46:30.740 --> 46:32.180]  Yeah, absolutely, if that's cool.
[46:32.180 --> 46:33.500]  So, ladies and gentlemen,
[46:33.500 --> 46:35.060]  I think I'm gonna just,
[46:35.060 --> 46:36.060]  I'm not sure how I'm gonna post it.
[46:36.060 --> 46:37.100]  I may edit some of this out.
[46:37.100 --> 46:37.940]  Go ahead, hit stop.
[46:37.940 --> 46:39.740]  But, no, I'm gonna keep recording.
[46:39.740 --> 46:41.100]  I like, there's a lot of good shit that happens.
[46:41.100 --> 46:41.940]  Every time I hit stop,
[46:41.940 --> 46:43.740]  somebody says something fucking great.
[46:43.740 --> 46:46.020]  So, just, I'll keep it going, and we'll take a dab.
[46:46.020 --> 46:48.420]  And I appreciate you guys doing the double show.
[46:48.440 --> 46:50.280]  I appreciate Wade for coming on the Agriculture Podcast.
[46:50.280 --> 46:51.680]  Yeah, thanks, Agriculture Podcast,
[46:51.680 --> 46:54.640]  for having me on, 100%, man.
[46:54.640 --> 46:57.240]  I appreciate, or doing this dual combo.
[46:57.240 --> 46:58.080]  It was kind of fun.
[46:58.080 --> 46:59.120]  And Gary, man, that was a nice little,
[46:59.120 --> 47:00.520]  thanks for letting me talk over you.
[47:00.520 --> 47:01.680]  I'm glad you have some stuff to say,
[47:01.680 --> 47:02.800]  and I'm glad you're gonna stick around,
[47:02.800 --> 47:03.640]  because we did,
[47:03.640 --> 47:04.480]  I can't wait to listen to the interview.
[47:04.480 --> 47:05.320]  It was a quick 45 minutes.
[47:05.320 --> 47:06.800]  I came to hear a lot of good shit.
[47:06.800 --> 47:07.640]  Yeah, it was.
[47:07.640 --> 47:09.200]  I'm sorry I gotta bounce and do my job,
[47:09.200 --> 47:10.560]  but that's what I gots to go do.
[47:10.560 --> 47:11.480]  Yeah, I hope you tear it up.
[47:11.480 --> 47:13.000]  Wade's been getting a lot of stage time,
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.480]  and he looks more, less robotic,
[47:15.480 --> 47:18.360]  less, he looks less like a game show host,
[47:19.300 --> 47:20.120]  and more like a comedian now,
[47:20.120 --> 47:20.960]  and that's a big compliment.
[47:20.960 --> 47:21.780]  Really, man, thank you.
[47:21.780 --> 47:22.740]  I appreciate that.
[47:22.740 --> 47:24.980]  I tried to find the most gentle way to tell him before,
[47:24.980 --> 47:26.660]  is like, you're kind of game show host-y, bro.
[47:26.660 --> 47:29.140]  You said that in a couple of conversations
[47:29.140 --> 47:30.460]  in like, passing, though.
[47:30.460 --> 47:32.660]  You know, like, mise en blague, or whatever you call that.
[47:32.660 --> 47:33.780]  Well, yeah, because I don't want to hurt your feelings,
[47:33.780 --> 47:35.940]  and I want to be able to walk away while you deal with it.
[47:35.940 --> 47:37.940]  Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?
[47:37.940 --> 47:40.340]  I can see the look on your face when you're ready to cry.
[47:40.340 --> 47:43.380]  Well, fuck yourself when you're ready to cry.
[47:43.380 --> 47:46.980]  But no, it is, I'm learning to,
[47:46.980 --> 47:51.440]  if anything, that competition that I didn't lose, but lost.
[47:51.440 --> 47:52.280]  There you go.
[47:53.520 --> 47:55.960]  Taught me is to control that energy,
[47:55.960 --> 47:59.040]  like you and Tommy, kind of put that into perspective.
[47:59.040 --> 48:00.840]  You don't come across as abrasive.
[48:00.840 --> 48:04.720]  Come across as a, fuck, people,
[48:04.720 --> 48:05.560]  you know what I'm trying to say, right?
[48:05.560 --> 48:06.880]  Well, yeah, and that's what, like,
[48:06.880 --> 48:09.120]  last night was a huge focus for me,
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.920]  was to not let that energy and excitement
[48:13.400 --> 48:15.760]  take over my body action type of thing.
[48:15.760 --> 48:16.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[48:17.180 --> 48:19.080]  Every moment of your stage time last night was precise.
[48:19.080 --> 48:21.960]  It felt like you should have been doing,
[48:21.960 --> 48:23.600]  like, you know what I mean?
[48:23.600 --> 48:25.720]  You're one of the only people that used a lot of the stage.
[48:25.720 --> 48:28.680]  Only the more experienced guys used the stage.
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.160]  The first few people before you stood at the pole.
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.720]  Like, here's the mic stand where the guy left it before me,
[48:34.720 --> 48:36.600]  and that means that's my territory.
[48:36.600 --> 48:38.600]  I tell you what, though, the guy after me, Deacon,
[48:38.600 --> 48:40.840]  that dude crushed me.
[48:40.840 --> 48:42.440]  That dude crushed.
[48:42.440 --> 48:43.880]  He killed.
[48:43.880 --> 48:45.040]  But he's a pro.
[48:45.060 --> 48:46.580]  He's a traveling road comic.
[48:46.580 --> 48:50.020]  And if I got as much time as him, then maybe I would too.
[48:50.020 --> 48:51.140]  Anyway, I do.
[48:51.140 --> 48:51.980]  What am I talking about?
[48:51.980 --> 48:54.660]  You give me five minutes, I'll kill like that shit.
[48:54.660 --> 48:57.260]  I'd like to see you get a good 10 or 15 up on a stage like
[48:57.260 --> 48:58.380]  that. Called it the end of day, man.
[48:58.380 --> 48:59.380]  Yeah? Oh, yeah.
[48:59.380 --> 49:01.340]  So do they do more two minutes, or do you increase?
[49:01.340 --> 49:04.140]  No, no, the next time they call me is three minutes.
[49:04.140 --> 49:05.500]  And then when I prove myself at three,
[49:05.500 --> 49:07.180]  I get another minute.
[49:07.180 --> 49:08.020]  That's, hey.
[49:08.020 --> 49:09.540]  And then after four, I get five,
[49:09.540 --> 49:11.500]  and then after five, I get 10.
[49:11.500 --> 49:12.980]  Comedy works the video game.
[49:13.860 --> 49:14.820]  That's about it.
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.980]  But I'm fighting with 100 plus comics at the same time.
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.600]  And it's a fucking battle, man.
[49:23.600 --> 49:24.440]  And I love it.
[49:26.280 --> 49:27.120]  We'll get out of here, my friend.
[49:27.120 --> 49:27.940]  I'm out of here, guys.
[49:27.940 --> 49:28.780]  Go to a comedy show, peace and love.
[49:28.780 --> 49:29.600]  Thank you very much, man.
[49:29.600 --> 49:30.440]  It's great doing a podcast with you.
[49:30.440 --> 49:32.480]  It's weird watching you leave while we record.
[49:32.480 --> 49:33.320]  Be careful.
[49:33.320 --> 49:34.820]  You turn your mic off.
[49:34.820 --> 49:36.800]  That's weird.
[49:38.520 --> 49:39.360]  Have fun, dude.
[49:39.360 --> 49:40.200]  Cheer it up.
[49:40.200 --> 49:41.020]  All right, Wade's taking off,
[49:41.020 --> 49:43.400]  so I'm gonna turn my chair towards Gary
[49:43.420 --> 49:46.700]  and let him interview me, which feels weird.
[49:46.700 --> 49:47.980]  All right, I think we're legit.
[49:47.980 --> 49:50.020]  I'm gonna grab my dad tools so they're closer to me.
[49:50.020 --> 49:51.980]  But other than that, I'm ready to rock.
[49:52.840 --> 49:53.680]  Thank you, guys.
[49:54.860 --> 49:55.700]  Thank you, Wade.
[49:55.700 --> 49:56.520]  Tired out tonight.
[49:56.520 --> 49:57.360]  Be safe, please.
[49:57.360 --> 49:58.180]  Hey, call me after if you want to.
[49:58.180 --> 49:59.020]  I will, absolutely.
[49:59.020 --> 50:00.220]  Gary, see you, man.
[50:00.220 --> 50:01.060]  Later, take care.
[50:04.920 --> 50:06.520]  So let's start with, like,
[50:08.080 --> 50:09.760]  how far back do you go?
[50:09.760 --> 50:11.160]  You know, where were you
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.160]  in relation to marijuana as a business
[50:17.660 --> 50:21.400]  when it was made legal for medical use?
[50:21.400 --> 50:23.160]  When it was made legal for medical use,
[50:23.160 --> 50:25.280]  I wasn't established as a business yet.
[50:25.280 --> 50:26.400]  I was a medical patient.
[50:26.400 --> 50:29.040]  It took me a while to catch on as a medical patient.
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.480]  I've been, I was a street dealer when I was in high school.
[50:32.480 --> 50:34.880]  And I knew the guys that had all of it.
[50:34.880 --> 50:37.320]  And so they were, they kind of recruited me
[50:37.320 --> 50:39.920]  because I'm charismatic and, excuse me,
[50:39.920 --> 50:41.800]  I was always buying it out here and there.
[50:42.220 --> 50:45.260]  I was that guy that, as soon as I got into smoking weed,
[50:45.260 --> 50:46.240]  I didn't want to buy it
[50:46.240 --> 50:47.660]  because I smoked way too much to buy it.
[50:47.660 --> 50:49.820]  So I'd buy an ounce and make my quarter out of it
[50:49.820 --> 50:52.060]  by giving everybody else theirs for whatever.
[50:52.060 --> 50:54.020]  So that's how I started my entrepreneurship.
[50:54.020 --> 50:58.140]  And then I started shopping at a specific dispensary.
[50:58.140 --> 50:59.900]  I was going to Metamar Ministries.
[50:59.900 --> 51:01.660]  It was the first dispensary in Pueblo.
[51:01.660 --> 51:02.500]  Gotcha.
[51:02.500 --> 51:04.500]  And the guy, I was shopping there
[51:04.500 --> 51:06.140]  and they were good at what they did,
[51:06.140 --> 51:08.580]  but they didn't, I didn't,
[51:08.580 --> 51:10.580]  I can't say I didn't like the way they treated the customer,
[51:10.580 --> 51:11.540]  but I wasn't satisfied.
[51:12.280 --> 51:13.120]  I knew there was something lacking
[51:13.120 --> 51:13.940]  in their customer service.
[51:13.940 --> 51:15.920]  And one day a customer, we were all sitting at the table.
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.680]  This was, I called it the wild, wild west.
[51:17.680 --> 51:19.600]  We would sit in there and smoke all day and just hang out.
[51:19.600 --> 51:21.200]  I could buy another eighth and smoke that eighth
[51:21.200 --> 51:22.800]  while I'm there and just hang out.
[51:22.800 --> 51:24.720]  If I had a day off, I'd just be there.
[51:24.720 --> 51:26.280]  What year was that roughly?
[51:26.280 --> 51:30.280]  Oh, I want to say 2008 approximately.
[51:30.280 --> 51:32.520]  And I've got a bad memory when it comes to dates.
[51:32.520 --> 51:35.560]  But medical use is well-established at that point.
[51:35.560 --> 51:37.400]  Right, yeah, it was well and going.
[51:37.400 --> 51:38.220]  And so-
[51:38.220 --> 51:39.560]  But pretty unregulated as far as dispensaries.
[51:39.560 --> 51:40.760]  Completely unregulated.
[51:40.820 --> 51:44.540]  I was finding friends that grow
[51:44.540 --> 51:47.420]  and maybe myself that might've been growing illegally.
[51:47.420 --> 51:49.580]  Well, it was legal then because I had my card now.
[51:49.580 --> 51:51.860]  And I was bringing those pounds and quarter pounds
[51:51.860 --> 51:54.580]  to the dispensary and selling those off the shelf
[51:54.580 --> 51:56.220]  and just selling those to my boss.
[51:56.220 --> 51:57.040]  Like, here you go.
[51:57.040 --> 51:57.880]  And he would just pay cash for them.
[51:57.880 --> 51:58.940]  Like, here you go.
[51:58.940 --> 52:01.860]  And so it'd be like, I had two jobs all the time.
[52:01.860 --> 52:03.220]  And so I got in good with the guys
[52:03.220 --> 52:05.340]  that worked at that dispensary when I kept going there.
[52:05.340 --> 52:07.660]  And a good lady asked a question
[52:07.660 --> 52:09.140]  and I could tell the guy that owned the place
[52:09.140 --> 52:10.180]  or ran the place was stumped.
[52:10.600 --> 52:11.640]  And I chimed in with my answer
[52:11.640 --> 52:13.520]  and I could tell he was impressed.
[52:13.520 --> 52:14.560]  So as I left, he said,
[52:14.560 --> 52:17.200]  hey, can you come help me transplant some plants tomorrow?
[52:17.200 --> 52:19.320]  And of course I showed up early and eager
[52:19.320 --> 52:20.520]  because I knew this was my way.
[52:20.520 --> 52:22.160]  And I wanted to get into the medical industry.
[52:22.160 --> 52:24.200]  I've always liked customer service,
[52:24.200 --> 52:26.040]  but I've always hated customer service.
[52:26.040 --> 52:26.880]  Right.
[52:26.880 --> 52:29.540]  It feels really good helping people that want to be helped,
[52:29.540 --> 52:31.240]  but people that don't want to be helped.
[52:31.240 --> 52:33.880]  I've worked at guitar stores
[52:33.880 --> 52:36.040]  where I want to sell you the really good shit,
[52:36.040 --> 52:37.060]  but the store won't.
[52:37.060 --> 52:39.000]  It's too expensive and your budget doesn't allow.
[52:39.040 --> 52:41.140]  But I can help you cure your ailments with cannabis.
[52:41.140 --> 52:42.900]  I'm that knowledgeable.
[52:42.900 --> 52:44.500]  So it was wonderful working there.
[52:44.500 --> 52:45.620]  And so I was there for quite a while.
[52:45.620 --> 52:46.940]  And then eventually they shut down the store
[52:46.940 --> 52:47.780]  is the short story.
[52:47.780 --> 52:50.180]  The city came in and a lawyer and a cop
[52:50.180 --> 52:52.300]  and handed us a letter that said cease and desist.
[52:52.300 --> 52:54.060]  That was the end of that dispensary.
[52:54.060 --> 52:54.900]  Wow.
[52:54.900 --> 52:55.720]  And what were the grounds?
[52:55.720 --> 52:56.740]  What did they shut them down?
[52:56.740 --> 53:00.300]  You know, we were improperly zoned was their main clause.
[53:00.300 --> 53:02.460]  And we were right in the middle of town.
[53:02.460 --> 53:05.020]  That's where everything meets is right there.
[53:05.020 --> 53:06.380]  Right.
[53:06.380 --> 53:08.540]  I made a joke about,
[53:09.040 --> 53:09.880]  if we had better products,
[53:09.880 --> 53:11.000]  we could charge more, have more business,
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.980]  which because I'm a connoisseur and I wanted better product.
[53:13.980 --> 53:16.440]  And so they gave me plants and they said, grow these.
[53:16.440 --> 53:17.880]  And they wanted me to grow their strains.
[53:17.880 --> 53:20.960]  And I brought back their clones that I grew.
[53:20.960 --> 53:22.480]  And my boss said, well, shit,
[53:22.480 --> 53:24.920]  you produce better medicine than me and giggled.
[53:24.920 --> 53:27.160]  And so I signed up people to be caregiver for
[53:27.160 --> 53:29.080]  and sort of growing for them.
[53:29.080 --> 53:31.620]  And I got really good at it really quickly.
[53:31.620 --> 53:33.560]  And then I started, I bought seeds.
[53:33.560 --> 53:34.760]  And as soon as I bought seeds,
[53:34.760 --> 53:37.800]  I saw the difference in seed figure compared to clones.
[53:37.820 --> 53:39.660]  Cause seeds where it's at, dude.
[53:39.660 --> 53:41.020]  And you don't get bugs.
[53:41.020 --> 53:43.340]  Every time I got clones from any dispensary or anybody,
[53:43.340 --> 53:44.980]  I found something I wish I wouldn't have found
[53:44.980 --> 53:46.220]  on nearly every clone.
[53:46.220 --> 53:47.700]  Right.
[53:47.700 --> 53:50.500]  Seeds, that's your fault if you get it from a seed crop.
[53:51.580 --> 53:55.740]  So I started growing from seed and then I knew,
[53:55.740 --> 53:56.740]  I saw strains that I liked,
[53:56.740 --> 53:59.180]  but I knew there was something I could get out of it better.
[53:59.180 --> 54:01.300]  And so I just started doing what any, you know,
[54:01.300 --> 54:02.980]  enthusiastic cannabis grower would do.
[54:02.980 --> 54:04.380]  And I started getting males and females
[54:04.380 --> 54:06.460]  and putting them in separate end rooms together
[54:06.480 --> 54:08.200]  and making seeds and growing those.
[54:08.200 --> 54:10.640]  And eventually I felt comfortable with the seeds
[54:10.640 --> 54:12.040]  I'd produced from a couple of strains
[54:12.040 --> 54:13.680]  and I started sharing them.
[54:13.680 --> 54:15.440]  And as soon as other people posted pictures,
[54:15.440 --> 54:17.940]  I saw that I had some shit nobody else had
[54:17.940 --> 54:19.000]  and that there was a good following
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.600]  that I had to make a bunch of these.
[54:20.600 --> 54:22.960]  And it became not only profitable,
[54:22.960 --> 54:25.360]  but it was, I feel really good about the seeds I put out.
[54:25.360 --> 54:27.160]  My goal was I got a golden goat clone.
[54:27.160 --> 54:29.320]  And one of my first goals was to get golden goat
[54:29.320 --> 54:34.240]  around the world because it helps so many medicinal
[54:34.240 --> 54:35.520]  problems that'll help.
[54:35.540 --> 54:38.420]  Headaches, seizures, anxiety.
[54:38.420 --> 54:39.780]  It's just a really great strain.
[54:39.780 --> 54:42.060]  Golden goat's got some great genetics in there
[54:42.060 --> 54:44.740]  that produces great cannabinoids that really heal.
[54:44.740 --> 54:46.300]  So I wanted that available.
[54:46.300 --> 54:48.940]  I don't think it's fair that we hoard genetics.
[54:48.940 --> 54:49.780]  That's kind of,
[54:49.780 --> 54:52.340]  I mean people that just keep their clones to themselves.
[54:52.340 --> 54:53.780]  If you've got a good CBD cut,
[54:53.780 --> 54:55.980]  I think a cancer patient should get one of those.
[54:55.980 --> 54:57.940]  You know, you shouldn't keep it to yourself.
[54:57.940 --> 54:59.500]  So I wanted to get it around.
[54:59.500 --> 55:01.180]  So I started making seeds and then it just grew
[55:01.180 --> 55:02.220]  from there, it snowballed.
[55:02.240 --> 55:06.400]  There was demand and making the seeds cost money.
[55:06.400 --> 55:09.400]  So I found a way to make the seeds profitable.
[55:09.400 --> 55:11.940]  And then I made a clothing line,
[55:11.940 --> 55:14.900]  which I sell more shirts and stickers and pins
[55:14.900 --> 55:17.300]  than I have ever sold seeds, which I find ironic.
[55:17.300 --> 55:21.640]  Yeah, that's a testament to your branding abilities.
[55:21.640 --> 55:22.480]  Well, thank you.
[55:22.480 --> 55:23.300]  Thank you.
[55:23.300 --> 55:26.940]  And I seem to be a sort of a social media monster.
[55:26.940 --> 55:29.880]  I like to tweet and Facebook and Instagram.
[55:29.880 --> 55:31.080]  And that's built me up a lot.
[55:31.100 --> 55:34.060]  I've got 5,000 Instagram followers, which isn't huge yet,
[55:34.060 --> 55:34.900]  but that's getting there.
[55:34.900 --> 55:36.340]  That's respectable.
[55:36.340 --> 55:38.300]  Right, that's my cannabis photography.
[55:38.300 --> 55:41.620]  And I try to answer, I hit 90% of the questions back.
[55:41.620 --> 55:43.180]  I respond personally myself.
[55:43.180 --> 55:46.020]  It's just me doing iRegenetics's internet stuff.
[55:46.020 --> 55:48.460]  So a question, some of them I have to,
[55:48.460 --> 55:51.220]  I'll say refer to my forum, because I do have a forum.
[55:51.220 --> 55:52.780]  And if you've asked a question a thousand times,
[55:52.780 --> 55:55.160]  it's probably answered somewhere else on the internet.
[55:55.160 --> 55:56.240]  You can find that.
[55:56.240 --> 55:57.460]  I hate to be rude about it,
[55:57.460 --> 55:59.420]  but I'll answer some stuff that's I'm like,
[55:59.520 --> 56:00.600]  ooh, if it's an interesting question,
[56:00.600 --> 56:01.920]  I'll definitely answer.
[56:01.920 --> 56:04.040]  But it's the same one I get bored with.
[56:04.040 --> 56:05.200]  You gotta read your own books,
[56:05.200 --> 56:07.400]  simple books or simple books that you should have already
[56:07.400 --> 56:08.240]  if you're gonna grow weed.
[56:08.240 --> 56:09.720]  Right, right.
[56:09.720 --> 56:14.720]  And any books you would recommend, like save me, right?
[56:14.720 --> 56:15.960]  This is a good example.
[56:18.240 --> 56:20.200]  The grower that I'm going to work for,
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.600]  his model is to take a caregiver, a new caregiver,
[56:24.600 --> 56:26.480]  and train him to be a grower.
[56:26.500 --> 56:30.620]  And they have a dedicated space
[56:30.620 --> 56:32.740]  that they live in and they grow in.
[56:32.740 --> 56:36.380]  And it's a three-grow commitment,
[56:36.380 --> 56:38.420]  and you split the proceeds of each grow.
[56:38.420 --> 56:40.220]  And he has the market already established
[56:40.220 --> 56:42.380]  with his dispensaries, right?
[56:42.380 --> 56:45.700]  And so that's how you learn.
[56:45.700 --> 56:46.540]  That's pretty neat.
[56:46.540 --> 56:48.420]  Yeah, and then you're free to go.
[56:48.420 --> 56:49.380]  Then you're free to grow your own.
[56:49.380 --> 56:50.700]  Yeah, or go to work.
[56:50.700 --> 56:53.260]  And so we're thinking about the next logical step here
[56:53.280 --> 56:56.600]  would be when we talk to the dispensary,
[56:56.600 --> 57:01.600]  their biggest problem is keeping a competent grower.
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.240]  So what if we offered you a grower as a service?
[57:07.240 --> 57:09.080]  You pay us X number of dollars a month
[57:09.080 --> 57:12.760]  and we provide you with a grower, all the expertise,
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.280]  we have oversight, we have the expert guy here
[57:16.280 --> 57:18.040]  if anything goes wrong.
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.940]  We got a guy 40 hours a week to be there.
[57:22.800 --> 57:24.240]  That'd be ideal for a lot of guys now.
[57:24.900 --> 57:26.820]  Especially these larger dispensaries
[57:26.820 --> 57:28.340]  that really have to produce a product
[57:28.340 --> 57:31.340]  on a consistent basis with limited space.
[57:31.340 --> 57:33.180]  You can't afford to lose a crop.
[57:33.180 --> 57:35.540]  You can't, your schedule's too tight.
[57:35.540 --> 57:37.580]  So this could ensure some continuity
[57:37.580 --> 57:38.620]  and we're thinking that's a good way
[57:38.620 --> 57:40.060]  to maybe grow in the future.
[57:41.300 --> 57:45.140]  So think about the impact of that on the industry.
[57:45.140 --> 57:48.100]  It would be a significant change, it would be a real shift.
[57:48.100 --> 57:50.100]  Everybody would be growing quality cannabis,
[57:50.100 --> 57:50.940]  which would really help out.
[57:50.940 --> 57:53.620]  Help with pricing start to come down
[57:53.680 --> 57:56.280]  and a more uniform product.
[57:56.280 --> 57:59.200]  You'd have a more stable career path.
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.360]  As a new guy, I wanna ask you a question.
[58:01.360 --> 58:03.520]  How does the product vary now?
[58:03.520 --> 58:04.920]  What do you see while you're in Colorado
[58:04.920 --> 58:07.840]  on a scale of like holy shit to oh man,
[58:07.840 --> 58:08.680]  what are you seeing?
[58:08.680 --> 58:09.560]  That's a good question.
[58:09.560 --> 58:14.440]  And I've seen like real variation in pricing
[58:14.440 --> 58:16.720]  from recreational dispensaries
[58:16.720 --> 58:19.760]  to medical dispensaries to the street.
[58:19.820 --> 58:23.540]  Huge, huge variation and a huge variation in quality.
[58:24.380 --> 58:25.220]  Huge, right?
[58:25.220 --> 58:27.980]  From A to Z completely from one to 10 on the scale.
[58:27.980 --> 58:32.980]  So far, no source is more predictable for quality.
[58:32.980 --> 58:35.060]  They're all three just as underlined.
[58:35.060 --> 58:37.300]  Whether I'm buying from the street, a medical dispensary
[58:37.300 --> 58:40.060]  or from a recreational dispensary,
[58:40.060 --> 58:41.580]  I'm rolling the dice every time.
[58:41.580 --> 58:43.780]  And that's why I recommend the caregiver model.
[58:43.780 --> 58:47.500]  I've been a caregiver for the same five people
[58:47.500 --> 58:49.340]  for probably five years now.
[58:49.920 --> 58:50.760]  And I know them all personally.
[58:50.760 --> 58:52.280]  We sit at the stable together
[58:52.280 --> 58:54.080]  and talk about what's wrong with them.
[58:54.080 --> 58:55.840]  And that's really keeping to the spirit
[58:55.840 --> 58:56.840]  of the caregiver model.
[58:56.840 --> 58:59.560]  And that's what the establishment I'm working with.
[58:59.560 --> 59:00.680]  That's the way they do it too.
[59:00.680 --> 59:02.960]  They really want you to be an actual caregiver.
[59:02.960 --> 59:03.800]  Check this one out.
[59:03.800 --> 59:05.040]  That's a grateful dog.
[59:07.280 --> 59:09.800]  That's GD77 out of the breeding project.
[59:09.800 --> 59:10.920]  That's got a nice smell.
[59:10.920 --> 59:12.200]  We'll put some of that in a minute here
[59:12.200 --> 59:14.360]  once we get some interview going.
[59:15.680 --> 59:16.520]  Yeah, that's really.
[59:16.520 --> 59:17.340]  I'm pretty dabbed.
[59:17.340 --> 59:18.640]  I don't need to try to stay focused.
[59:19.420 --> 59:20.380]  My throat cleared.
[59:21.380 --> 59:22.220]  It was great earlier.
[59:22.220 --> 59:24.940]  Just about the time it settled in,
[59:24.940 --> 59:26.540]  you both stopped talking and looked at me
[59:26.540 --> 59:27.500]  and said, okay, speak.
[59:27.500 --> 59:29.180]  And I was like, huh?
[59:29.180 --> 59:30.020]  I knew we did that too.
[59:30.020 --> 59:31.220]  I saw it right after we did it.
[59:31.220 --> 59:33.260]  I went, oh yeah, he's on the spot and dabbed.
[59:33.260 --> 59:34.100]  Yeah, it was terrible.
[59:34.100 --> 59:34.920]  It was perfect for you.
[59:34.920 --> 59:36.140]  That's how we do a podcast.
[59:36.140 --> 59:37.700]  Right, that was great.
[59:37.700 --> 59:40.900]  But yeah, I'm a big fan of the 719 the blocks podcast.
[59:40.900 --> 59:43.220]  I've been listening since I knew about it,
[59:43.220 --> 59:44.100]  which is a couple of months.
[59:44.100 --> 59:46.420]  I've gone back to and listened to almost all of them.
[59:46.420 --> 59:47.660]  Cool, thank you.
[59:48.280 --> 59:49.680]  We definitely appreciate that support.
[59:49.680 --> 59:51.600]  So I saw the announcement
[59:51.600 --> 59:53.120]  that you were gonna have your own podcast.
[59:53.120 --> 59:56.360]  And then the next announcement I saw was for episode two.
[59:56.360 --> 59:57.480]  So I haven't listened yet.
[59:57.480 --> 59:58.320]  Okay.
[59:58.320 --> 59:59.160]  I will be there.
[59:59.160 --> 59:59.980]  It's only been about a week or so.
[59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.680]  And it took a long time for Stitcher to catch up.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.520]  Right, I got you.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.800]  But now that they're caught up, they'll be up in sync.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.640]  I got you, I see.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.480]  Yeah.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.300]  All right.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.880]  So yeah, I'm looking forward to listening to that as well.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.360]  I think you'll be episode number four
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.880]  is what I think you'll be a part of.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.720]  Excellent.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.540]  Three is recorded.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.380]  We'll post soon.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.920]  So, all right.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.920]  So how did recreational legalization affect your business?
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.760]  It's kind of a seed sales.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.720]  I do seeds is what I do.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.560]  I'm a caregiver.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.080]  All of my flowers are taken up by my patients and myself.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.520]  I make dabs out of my portion.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.920]  And then my patients, one guy wants half dabs, half flowers.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.400]  Kevin wants all dabs.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.600]  Another guy wants flowers.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.120]  So I know what they want.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.200]  One person I have to make topicals and food for them.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.860]  It's a pain in the ass.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.460]  I don't like doing it, but it's well worth it.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.940]  I got to take care of people.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:53.240]  So my business is based in seeds and clothing mostly.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.860]  So the clothing, it really helped out
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.180]  because now you can talk about being a cannabis smoker.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.900]  You can wear that openly and not be profiled.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.700]  And I've got a I heart dabs sticker.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.220]  And so that's getting super popular
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.940]  because you can heart dabs now.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.560]  You don't have to hide it.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.740]  For the seeds, most of my seeds, I give them to somebody
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.820]  and he distributes them for me in his manner.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.160]  And that goes internationally.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.520]  So I've seen a growth.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.840]  He says a lot of people from Colorado are inquiring.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.720]  And if we're face to face, I can get seeds to you.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.800]  But I can only be so many places at one time.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.280]  I'm not in the shops.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.520]  I'm not available in the recreational shops yet.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.200]  We're still getting the OPC.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.880]  There are a lot of offers, but people want my brand
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.080]  and they don't want to help me.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.280]  I feel like they want to corrupt me.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.660]  And like you were saying, growers, I'm busy growing.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.620]  I'm busy breeding and growing and getting that OPC going.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.140]  That's a challenge for a guy like me.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.460]  I'm supposed to be in the grow room.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.260]  And the more I spend out there with the lawyer
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.300]  and the accountant, I get anxious.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.580]  So it's not my realm at all.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.220]  So once I get that established, I know my sales will boom.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.620]  I just need that OPC spot.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.340]  And I'm figuring it out slowly.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.180]  I like to take baby steps in that.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.540]  I'm not gonna give my brand away.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.380]  Oh, you can bump the mic.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.060]  I'll fix all that later on.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.900]  I'll try.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.400]  I'll try.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.220]  There you go.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.060]  I'll turn the legs.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:15.920]  That's it.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.440]  Yeah, your branding is perfect.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.120]  You do it very, very well.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.800]  And I've noticed that from the very beginning
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.280]  when I first started to look your stuff up,
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.280]  it's consistent, it's well done, it's good.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.080]  I tried to keep this logo to stick in your head.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.120]  Everybody brags about California.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.000]  And so I took the Colorado flag straight off
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.160]  and was like, so I'm a Rasta man and I love Colorado.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.320]  Let's do this.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.160]  Boom.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.220]  My buddy Tony made the logo with my inspiration.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.060]  So thanks, Tony.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:42.900]  Good work, bro.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:43.980]  It seems to stick.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.820]  Right on.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:51.780]  So, obviously, being a seller of seeds,
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.020]  legalization anywhere can greatly expand your business.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:55.860]  Absolutely.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.680]  Huge.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.520]  Exponential.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.360]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.180]  So that's a,
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.980]  because what I'm seeing really,
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.580]  and I don't know, this is arguable, of course,
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.060]  but what I see is I think that the industry
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.760]  is gonna go one of two ways.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.440]  We have a real chance, like especially me,
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.560]  someone who's getting an education,
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.720]  someone like you who has a strong background,
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.500]  you apply that in the right way.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.400]  If cannabis stays illegal, like on the state level,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.120]  say they reschedule and it takes the states
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.080]  a few years to catch up, that could be better for us
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.400]  than if it was like instantly legal
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.200]  all over the world at one time.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.580]  When things are illegal, profits are absolutely higher.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.420]  Exactly.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.240]  Yes.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.780]  And well, you also are able to build credentials
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:47.260]  and expertise and go through the stuff in small scale
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.460]  and enlarge it slowly rather than just be,
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.780]  boom, large scale all at once.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.780]  And there's a huge benefit in that.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.780]  Find something that works and be able to replicate it
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:00.340]  over and over again in a massive and amazing,
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.100]  and you may already be there with yours.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:06.240]  You can get to me.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.360]  Yeah, yeah, I have the capabilities.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.440]  Right.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:15.100]  And I think that's why he has this vision
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:20.100]  of a way to stabilize the whole grower situation
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.020]  in the dispensary market,
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.420]  which is like a key element of stable growth.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.260]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.080]  Right.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.500]  So I see that as like a massive opportunity as well.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.460]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.180]  It makes that industry so much more stable.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.060]  Agriculture, it's hard to get stable.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.900]  To get a stable production in agriculture.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.500]  Oh yeah, especially a product like cannabis.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.320]  And that's why you end up with factory farms
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.360]  where everything's regimented
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.240]  and they put X number of chemicals in
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.040]  and X number of chemicals come out.
[01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:58.270]  And the model we're using in the small modules,
[01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:00.310]  you keep everything small and organic
[01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:04.800]  and one person has his hands on it in massive scale.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.360]  Okay, so you'd take a guy like me and ask me,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.960]  how many lights can you run by yourself?
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.160]  That would pretty much be the basic question.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.000]  And then I'd say, I can do 10 to 15 lights by myself,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.320]  no problem, 40 hours a week.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.940]  I'd probably do more if it were in a facility
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.460]  that were easier than the area I've got now.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.300]  If it were set up like you're talking about.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.180]  If you had a half dozen competent assistants,
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.540]  you could probably do three times that.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.380]  Oh shit, yeah.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.820]  Yeah, but I feel like since I've got a smaller facility,
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.660]  I feel like I'm able to love each of those plants more.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.500]  Absolutely.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.660]  If I had seven kids, I feel like that seventh kid,
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.820]  I'm not gonna give too much of a shit.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.660]  Right.
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.580]  I've got one and I love the hell out of that one,
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:40.500]  but if there were three of them,
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.300]  I'd probably wanna slap each one of them a little bit more.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.140]  Exactly.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.400]  I feel like that happens with your plants too.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.840]  Once you hit that struggle time,
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.000]  there's a point when it's work that you love,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.880]  but I felt like, oh shit, before,
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.360]  I'm never gonna get through this trim job,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.720]  I gotta call a couple more friends over or something.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.600]  Once that gets overwhelming, it becomes work
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.160]  and I feel like the plants will suffer from that.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.240]  My plants know I love them,
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.800]  because I get to hug each one and tell them
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.880]  and I sing to them and I'm a weirdo in there.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.320]  That's what makes the difference, right?
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.400]  Is that personal attention.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:17.620]  The more detailed you can be with everything,
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.700]  the better off you are.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.140]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.780]  And that's just a time thing.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.020]  You can't be that detailed.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.940]  I wasn't that good when I first started,
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.620]  so it's also a lot of experience.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.220]  Yeah, see, that's the real key here too, is experience.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.140]  And that's what I feel like.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:37.060]  I need time to build more experience in the industry.
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.540]  I'm confident about my skills,
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.380]  but I need experience in the industry.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.740]  If I have more time to do that,
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.800]  then I think I'll be able to go a lot further
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.840]  as things scale larger.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.560]  And I missed all of the industry stuff.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.560]  I was busy branding and creating seeds and strains.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.000]  I don't know that you have.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.840]  Eliminating strains.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.520]  I think the best is yet to come.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.360]  I'd like to think so.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.280]  You're there.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.280]  I feel the wolves, I've had a couple of offers.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.640]  There's been money thrown in my face,
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.400]  but it all feels, all those guys feel like
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.560]  they're trying to, I want to take iReGenetics
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.400]  and do this with it.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.840]  They don't understand that that's my baby.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.220]  It's got to be golden for me to jump on that.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.860]  They don't understand that my brand
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.020]  is worth way more than money.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.940]  I've been living as a poor white guy for 35 years.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:21.260]  I'll do it for 35 more.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.460]  I'm good at that.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.300]  Yeah, I mean, you gotta have that.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.860]  If there aren't those out there that are willing to do that,
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.900]  then it'll all just become McDonald's.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.740]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.560]  Absolutely.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.680]  So that's another key element,
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.060]  is that there has to be a real diehard,
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.440]  in fucking Texas, Chile, every fucking day,
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.600]  365 days a year, that there has to be
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:08:00.890]  that reproduction involved.
[01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:01.910]  And that's what I'm afraid of.
[01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:03.810]  I'm afraid it's gonna become Weed Mart,
[01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:05.210]  and a lot of people will be okay with it
[01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.090]  because we're just happy to have cannabis,
[01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:09.930]  and they haven't seen top shelf cannabis.
[01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:11.290]  You know, they're just excited.
[01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.130]  You can go to Weed Mart and get a whole eight for $7.
[01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:15.810]  Yeah, and then, you know what?
[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:16.650]  That's weird.
[01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:17.490]  They're gonna do it.
[01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:19.370]  You see the cheap beer sells like a boss.
[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.090]  Yeah, sell the most, right?
[01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:21.930]  Yep.
[01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:23.670]  So, you know, the only way to combat that, too,
[01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.030]  is to grow, you know?
[01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.750]  Be as big as you can be,
[01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.430]  and still keep what you do what you do.
[01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:32.710]  And that's, you know, it's difficult at times
[01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:40.860]  for somebody like you who has to be hands on with everything.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.420]  My position's a great position to be in.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.260]  Right, it is.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.580]  It's enviable, really.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.500]  Oh, and I try not to take it for granted.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.180]  I try to wake up and say thank you
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.500]  to something every day.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.460]  Well, you know, in the podcast, it's a huge start,
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.460]  and doing it as a growth school is just amazing, dude.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.300]  Just really.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.280]  The listeners weren't part of that conversation earlier.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.120]  They may have been.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.940]  I'm not sure we've been recording
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.080]  for an hour and a half now, almost.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080]  They may end up being.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.080]  I said earlier that I wanna turn my version
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.000]  of the iGrow Culture podcast into,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.880]  it'll be a growth school.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.280]  You guys will get full growth class every lesson,
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.880]  or every episode will be a growth lesson.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.520]  So we'll go from germinating to transplanting
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.480]  to the veg stage, right up through flower,
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.080]  through harvest and cure, which I think is important.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.320]  And then we'll teach you,
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.320]  Kevin will come and talk about making dabs safely,
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.300]  and tell you what not to do.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.140]  Oh, that'd be great.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:26.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.220]  So that'll be a lot of episodes,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.580]  because there's a long process to growing weed there.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.500]  But that's what's gonna come in the future.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.340]  Well, that's great.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.180]  Really looking forward to that stuff.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:38.220]  Yeah, the making dabs safely,
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.700]  that's one of the big threats to the concentrates industry,
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.060]  is the danger of making dabs.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.620]  So I take that stuff to heart.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.660]  Yeah, there's a lot of people,
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.260]  I still read about one every two weeks,
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.140]  somebody blowing something up trying to make dabs.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.940]  Some house burning down in the suburbs,
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.380]  or a garage getting gutted.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.880]  Or an apartment or a hotel,
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.080]  guys, please don't do that.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.360]  Yeah, that makes us all look bad.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.280]  All of us, yeah.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.640]  We've taken far steps,
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.880]  and you knock us down a little bit every time you do it.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.960]  Right, yeah, that's pretty, it's awful stuff.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.160]  And people get hurt, you know?
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.000]  Yeah, that's-
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.820]  We don't want anybody to get hurt.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:08.800]  Especially the blasters,
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.760]  the innocent people in the house.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.320]  They always seem to be the ones that get the most hurt.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.960]  That's terrible stuff.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.960]  That's along the lines of drinking and driving,
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.800]  kind of stuff.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.720]  I agree, I agree, that's our version.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.380]  That's the cannabis world's version of a DUI.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.920]  Yeah, so let's not pretend like so many do,
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.420]  that there's absolutely no danger,
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.300]  that everything associated with marijuana
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.780]  is rosy and perfect.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.620]  And, you know, we don't have to pretend that, dude.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.140]  You know, you have to be responsible with your shit, man.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.380]  Everybody does.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.780]  And if you're high, keep your shit together,
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.100]  and don't fuck it up for the rest of us.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:39.940]  That's right.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.940]  And if you gotta grow, keep it out of the kids' area.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:42.780]  Yeah, yeah, do it the right way.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.780]  And that's none of my business to say
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.420]  what to do with your kids.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.140]  But I mean, like, if you got an outdoor grow,
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.540]  don't keep it where the elementary school kids
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.340]  are gonna walk by and steal some buds off of it,
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.180]  and take them to school,
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.820]  and get the whole cop thing going on,
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.640]  because that looks bad on everyone.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.480]  Yeah, please follow the law as much as possible, you know?
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.320]  Yeah.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.920]  And it's gonna help everybody if you do.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.600]  I agree. Including you.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.640]  Stop dabbing in the car.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.960]  I will if you do.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.840]  Definitely, please stop dabbing in the car.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.400]  At least pull over and park somewhere
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.640]  if you're gonna dab in the car.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.480]  Right?
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.320]  Yeah, at least.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.160]  Don't do it on the highway
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.200]  when you're driving with your knee.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.160]  That shit's scary.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:15.980]  Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.720]  I saw it this weekend, I was in Denver.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.280]  Saw somebody dropping a dab, driving with their knee.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.120]  Yeah.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.160]  Sloppily.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.620]  Yeah, that's gonna come back to haunt us.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.380]  Yeah, on the interstate.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.580]  Yeah, that's bad stuff.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.740]  Well, you closed your notebook, my friend.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.780]  Are you out of interview material?
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.620]  No, I had a couple more things.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.460]  Okay, good.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.280]  I don't wanna stop you.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.540]  The most important question, you know,
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.420]  the one you asked me, where do you think things are going?
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.100]  What do you see?
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.300]  I see a lot of corporate stuff coming up,
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.860]  like the Weed Mart that we hypothetically talk about.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.140]  I see that kind of thing coming.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.700]  I see more, once, people forgot that we can vote on shit.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.540]  Yeah.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.140]  It feels like, and once we remind people
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.520]  that we can vote on things, there will be moratoriums lifted
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.000]  and dispensaries will put in places,
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.920]  and once money comes to show politicians,
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.280]  here's my whatever check for however much,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.240]  here it is, can we build?
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.000]  People will say yes.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.800]  I do fear a lot of commercialization.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.840]  Corporate-y stuff, really, I don't like it.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.700]  I try not to shop at the bigger stores,
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.160]  so that stuff really intimidates me,
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.880]  and I see it could be decline in products,
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.380]  decline in quality, or it could really increase the quality,
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.420]  but it's hard to say.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.140]  River Rock is my largest example that I know of
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.940]  that produces quality cannabis on a large scale,
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.860]  and it took them, they have killer products now,
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.180]  but it took them a couple of years to get to where
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.700]  I would say that they've got a competitive product
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.460]  that's top shelf, their top shelf is top shelf,
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.140]  and they produce more than any other dispensary
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.180]  that I'm aware of.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.020]  I could be wrong.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.420]  Correct me if I am, at agroculture on Twitter.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.260]  Please inform me.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.860]  So, yeah, something that that touches on for me,
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.720]  I'm all about really high volume solutions
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.800]  that do things well, do things properly,
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.640]  organically, sustainably.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.440]  You see the tomato farm model coming up?
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.280]  I think so.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280]  Right alongside the highway,
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.120]  it looks just like you see the corn grow.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.720]  Yeah, high density, hydroponics, right?
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.240]  I can kind of see that, and that's kind of what I fear,
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.920]  because I grow from my heart, and there's no heart in that,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.320]  and that's part of what heals.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.560]  Well, but here's-
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.400]  That's hippie talk.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.100]  Where's the balance between the two?
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:26.100]  Because demand is gonna dictate production, right?
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.580]  And we all know what the demand is.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.860]  So if doing it with all your heart and all your soul
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.660]  doesn't produce enough,
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.020]  they're gonna get the opportunity to make a McDonald's.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:36.860]  That's true.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:37.700]  Plenty of people eat the-
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.420]  So, I mean, we gotta face that reality.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.620]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.340]  And that's a tough, it's a really tough question.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.140]  I don't wanna see it go corporatized either.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.680]  I wanna see this money, this revenue,
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.080]  remain in the hands of the people.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.160]  I mean, everything else is flowing to the top.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.540]  You know, look at the statistics.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.340]  Profits go to the 1%.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.180]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.180]  We divide the rest.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.220]  This is something, if we, you know,
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.420]  maybe the answer is,
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.580]  I was reading something about this co-op model,
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:22.530]  where small operation,
[01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:24.730]  so we all own a little piece of each other's business,
[01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:28.520]  no matter how different.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.980]  We use that unity to fight off, you know,
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.300]  RJ Reynolds, who is a giant corporation.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.940]  Individually, we're small businesses together.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.980]  We're a huge co-op.
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.620]  You kinda see that in the,
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.540]  if you're in the scene,
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.060]  you kinda see that with the growers,
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.300]  like on my scale.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.060]  We're kinda, we're trying to do that.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.020]  Yeah, that, I see that as, you know,
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.740]  that unity as a real potential way of making that,
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:15:01.060]  you know, expansion that can meet the demand of the product.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.040]  Yeah, keep us in the grow rooms.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.920]  Yeah, and the, you know, the patient, really.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.640]  You know, like it is medicine.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.200]  You know, for me, marijuana's always been a sacred thing.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.080]  You know, even when I didn't view it as medicine,
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.880]  it was something that did something for me.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.320]  Oh, yeah, yeah, from day one.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.160]  Yeah.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.760]  From day one, I knew the first time I smelled it,
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.400]  before I was even old enough to enjoy smoking,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.240]  or anything, I was like,
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.480]  I wanna try that when I'm old enough.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.520]  Yeah, it just, you know, it was very,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.560]  it's always been a very healing thing for me.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.780]  So I've seen, in my mind,
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.480]  I've seen those big farms you're talking about,
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.980]  big greenhouse, I've been in gigantic greenhouses,
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.260]  forever flowering, what's up guys,
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.020]  those are great greenhouses.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.340]  You could drive cars into those things.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.660]  You could drive your tractor into there,
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.220]  and dig your holes out for your 12 foot tall plants,
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.060]  and those things.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:43.900]  Yeah.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:47.400]  That is the future of cannabis in Colorado.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.460]  There are some states that are gonna try to,
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.540]  try to go really slowly,
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.040]  but are we gonna buy up all of our vacant land,
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.980]  all of our land that's semi-flat, and able to get water?
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.760]  Are we just gonna plant weed everywhere in America now?
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.800]  Or?
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.160]  That remains to be seen.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.280]  I think the people just need to learn to grow their own.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.120]  Yeah.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.480]  I like your idea of having a caregiver teach people,
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.520]  give you three months of your time,
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.800]  or three crops of your time.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.640]  Yeah.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.600]  Get you going, this is how you do it.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.700]  See ya, you can grow now, get out.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.640]  Yeah, and you've helped us grow,
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.920]  and then you have that, you know,
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.080]  you have that expertise, you can get to work,
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.560]  you can go grow for somebody,
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.240]  you can be a caregiver, and grow your own,
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.880]  and take care of people.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.220]  Or you can teach other people.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.920]  I do a lot of teaching.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.700]  Yeah, I should've charged $1 per hour,
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.180]  and I'd be a millionaire.
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.020]  That's it, that's.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.340]  I love it though, that's part of,
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:38.280]  that's what I'm here for.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.460]  I feel like I've got, I don't,
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:43.180]  I like stutter, and stop talking a lot,
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.780]  have, I'm not super good on a mic,
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.740]  but I feel like I know enough to where it's worth listening,
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.300]  to where I can get you through shit.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.860]  If you deal with me for enough episodes,
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.620]  we'll get comfortable together.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.380]  Well, that teaching stuff is,
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.940]  that's where you know, right?
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.560]  That's where you really, really know.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.160]  I was a drum teacher for quite a while.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.680]  I teach music, so I teach 13 year old boys
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.920]  how to play drums.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.640]  Yeah, people who value what they do teach it, right?
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.720]  You don't see anybody teaching
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.200]  how to make burgers at McDonald's.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.040]  Nah, nah.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:08.960]  Don't teach them.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.760]  That's kind of a great, that's a huge compliment.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.600]  I take that as a compliment.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.960]  Yeah, and teaching for free
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.600]  means you're doing it from your heart,
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.760]  so that's even more, you know,
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.200]  it just reflects the pride you have
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.400]  in the craft that you're teaching.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.240]  There you go.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.160]  We've gotta honor the plant.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.000]  Yeah.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.400]  It's a sacred plant, like you said,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.720]  we have to give it a lot of respect,
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:26.500]  and I feel, when I see somebody's garden
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.060]  that I know, I'm just like, aw, you poor baby.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.020]  It's like seeing abused monkeys at the zoo.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:31.860]  Yeah.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.300]  It's like, I know these monkeys should be fatter.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.260]  Give them more bananas.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.700]  We don't wanna see it commoditized,
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:41.700]  and we have to come back.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.380]  We'll just spread that thought among, you know,
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:45.260]  people in the community,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.260]  that we need to be thinking about
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.680]  how we're gonna keep out the corporate.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.400]  How we can make a difference,
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.000]  and it's not easy, and it's not gonna be,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.600]  but we can resist, at least, right?
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.440]  Yeah, you gotta take it out.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.840]  Even sometimes I have to rely on,
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.420]  the dispensaries and the corporations.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.380]  We all do.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.020]  I don't make good edibles, I don't think,
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.300]  and sometimes I'll be in a pinch,
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.060]  and if I'm going to a comedy show,
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.180]  I love to eat a nice edible,
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.500]  so I'll stop at a shop, you know,
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.620]  buy a $12 edible.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.460]  Right.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:13.940]  And there goes my money,
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.660]  my money that I grow from my heart
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.140]  into that corporate machine.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.220]  I get edibles every time I go.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.700]  If I'm forced to go to a-
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:21.900]  What do you like to eat?
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.460]  I like the little sweets, like the cookie type things.
[01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.020]  Okay, so you don't have a favorite brand
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.060]  that you go to or anything?
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:28.920]  No, not really.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.740]  Okay.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:30.580]  I just look for the cookie,
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.280]  about 100 milligrams or more.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.040]  That's about what I'm after.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:34.880]  Good deal, yeah.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.120]  Yeah, I did get some,
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.000]  they were like lemon drops,
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.010]  so they were, I really like those.
[01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.850]  Okay.
[01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:44.670]  Those are great.
[01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:45.510]  Okay, I'll research.
[01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:47.090]  That sounds like it might have been some Mile High.
[01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.370]  Yeah, I think those were mine.
[01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:49.210]  Cool.
[01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.030]  Pretty sure they were.
[01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:51.050]  Yeah, I read about those on another episode.
[01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:52.890]  Yeah, those were just amazing.
[01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:53.730]  Cool.
[01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:54.570]  Those were great.
[01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:55.970]  Cool.
[01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:56.930]  You know, and that's something else.
[01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:59.410]  You know, the edibles is a whole different aspect
[01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:04.460]  of cannabis began to touch people.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.740]  You know, it's something that I'm like
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.660]  just as in the dark about as anybody else.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.620]  It's a whole new ballgame.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.540]  Like the high, the dosing, everything.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.540]  I'm somewhat familiar with licensing
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.540]  just because I researched all the licensing
[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:17.380]  for the new brand.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.220]  All the kitchen stuff, yeah.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:19.880]  I've never paid any attention to that
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.260]  because I have no desire to do a kitchen.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.100]  I'm not a cook.
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.700]  Yeah, that's, man, that's crazy.
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:26.140]  And that's probably why there is no place
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.820]  that serves cannabis-based foods
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.680]  because those regulations are, you know,
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.320]  several pages of the standards of the kitchen.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.160]  Wow.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:34.980]  Yeah.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:35.820]  Yeah, see, I've never even looked into that one.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.800]  To operate that on a daily basis?
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.320]  Wow, that would be tough, yeah.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.640]  Well, I'd have to shave my head just to walk in.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.480]  Oh, really?
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.300]  Well, I don't know for sure,
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.140]  but I feel like with all the rules.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.360]  Yeah, you're gonna be in like
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.600]  one of those burn unit outfits, you know,
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.520]  with the gloves and the apron and the mask.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.160]  Could you imagine my chef hat full of dreads?
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:52.980]  I got dreads.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:53.820]  I'm six foot five, folks,
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.800]  and I got dreads past my ass, almost to my knees.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.020]  So I shouldn't be in a kitchen.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.860]  Yeah.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:00.680]  I'm not good for that.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.520]  That's hilarious.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.980]  Yeah, I'm a fire hazard myself.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.300]  But, yeah, you know, the message I wanna get out there
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.180]  is like, you know, we gotta push for some of this stuff.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:14.060]  Like the smoking room here in town.
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:14.900]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.580]  Please, look at the Facebook page.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:19.340]  It's like Pueblo Cannabis Enthusiasts.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.260]  Pueblo Cannabis Enthusiasts on Facebook.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.100]  Check it out, you guys.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:22.920]  Yeah, like it.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.140]  There's a lot of information coming out.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.100]  We're actually looking for real estate right now.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.520]  It needs to be zoned R6.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.360]  Yeah, if you don't know the zone,
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360]  you know of an available building, that's great.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.760]  You can just send us a message.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.760]  We'd be glad to check it out.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.600]  But we were kind of looking at some property
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.720]  on like South Lake Avenue.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.560]  Okay.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560]  Kind of a depressed area, a lot of vacant stuff there.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.400]  But it's coming up.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.800]  They've gentrified that neighborhood.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.440]  They are in the process, it appears,
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.880]  of gentrifying that whole neighborhood.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:47.960]  It looks nice down there.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.800]  It really does.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.620]  They're getting it cleaned up.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.840]  That used to be a sketchy part of town.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.680]  Yeah.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.560]  But they are cleaning it up.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.240]  I don't think any of the neighbors down there
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.780]  would complain about us being there.
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:59.940]  Not in that, well there is a halfway house
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:04.620]  kind of near Nevada-ish and Lake.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.060]  Well, listen, I'm looking further down.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:06.900]  Okay.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.020]  Like a prairie.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:08.840]  Oh, perfect.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.820]  Yeah, yeah, the far end.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.660]  Okay.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.780]  So that could be, you know,
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.460]  close to the greener side out there.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.300]  Ah.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.860]  Capture some of that out of town traffic.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:17.700]  There you go.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.540]  That's what we're looking for.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.420]  That would be awesome.
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:27.500]  Yeah, there's a restaurant down there that's vacant.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:32.580]  We're thinking that or there's a bar down there.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.620]  But we don't have anything, so any leads on that.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.020]  So don't get excited yet, people.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.260]  Any leads on property would be great.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.740]  But we like that area, you know?
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:41.580]  Yeah, that's a good area.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.220]  Yeah, you get that highway traffic.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.060]  Yeah.
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.540]  Yeah, you'd catch me down there, guys,
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:46.580]  dabbing out once in a while.
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:47.420]  Absolutely.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:49.180]  So that's a great endorsement.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.020]  I'll go down there.
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:50.860]  I like to get out of the house.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.020]  I like to be able to go smoke somewhere.
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.180]  I like to get out and get social,
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.260]  but I don't do the bar thing.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.580]  I don't like the drunk people, so I avoid the bars.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.400]  The party we attended there, where we met,
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.360]  that was a lot of fun.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.840]  There were a lot of great people there.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.000]  Met a lot of folks, but it was really friendly.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.500]  I've had two people on the show that we met
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.760]  at that place that night.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.720]  Adam Gaskins came on the show also.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.680]  Oh, that's great.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.160]  That's really cool.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.120]  And I've been going to the Springs, the clubs there,
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.520]  and I enjoy going to them.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.360]  We can say the name of those.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.400]  Is that the Lazy Lion?
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.040]  Lazy Lion and Speakeasy.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.440]  Oh, those are separate places?
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.680]  Yeah, and they're right down the street
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.040]  from each other on Bee's U,
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.960]  like the 2500 block of Bee's U.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.800]  Cool.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.640]  Really easy to find.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.820]  Temple parking, yeah.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:30.660]  Yeah, shout out to the Weed Pimps, J-Dub.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.500]  Weed Pimps run that place, yeah.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:32.340]  And the crew.
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:35.300]  They're associated with the Speakeasy down there.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.340]  Good guys.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.720]  Yeah, we'll tag them there as well.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.160]  Right, we'll share.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.320]  I love them even if they don't.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.160]  Those are good guys.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:43.980]  Yeah, they are good.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:44.920]  We support each other in our own ways.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.040]  Yeah, so check those guys out if you're ever in the Springs.
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:47.960]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960]  I've always had a good time
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.480]  when I've gone to either of those places.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.000]  Cool, next time I'm driving through,
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.040]  I go to Denver often, and on the way back,
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.120]  I need to stop, so.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:55.960]  Oh, that'd be perfect, yeah.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.900]  The Lazy Lion's good for that.
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.440]  They have nice restrooms here in Sedan.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.760]  Everything's all Rastafari from the photos I've seen,
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.760]  so if it's all red, gold, and green in there, I'll be happy.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.240]  Yeah, a lot of good music.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.080]  Cool.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:08.920]  Yeah, it's nice.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.640]  They just got a fat plug from us.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.800]  Yeah, they really did.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.640]  Both of them did.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.080]  See you at the VIP booth, guys.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:14.920]  Right.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.720]  No, those are legitimate plugs, though.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.560]  We like those guys.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.000]  Yeah, oh yeah, you gotta support the good stuff.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.520]  That's part of what I'm here for.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.560]  Absolutely.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.520]  So will you have, will it be,
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.840]  if you get your spot open, will you have,
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:28.540]  will it be a bring your own dab kinda place,
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.980]  or will you guys supply the dabs?
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.940]  Probably bring your own dab kinda place.
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:32.780]  Okay.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.700]  And we may do some events a couple times a month
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.620]  where you pay a flat 20 bucks
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.540]  to get all the dabs you want, something like that.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.380]  That's a fun party.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.220]  That's kinda what we're looking at.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.060]  Yeah, cool.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.540]  Kind of a balance between the two.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.380]  Sounds great.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:45.140]  An everyday place to come and smoke,
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.740]  and occasionally we'll have a little blowout.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.460]  Any sort of grow competitions or grow-offs
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.540]  or anything like that there?
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:53.060]  That, you know, I might associate myself
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.780]  with iReed Genetics and let them sponsor
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.620]  that kinda stuff,
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.720]  because they have the expertise.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.680]  That'd be a lot of fun.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.280]  And anybody else who has a MMJ-related business
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.960]  or RMJ-related business who wants to associate themselves
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.200]  and, you know, help promote us through your network,
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.960]  we're really open to anything we can do there.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.320]  Just contact us through the Facebook page.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.520]  Be glad to talk to you.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.880]  One person who owns a building here in town
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.480]  is contacting me through the Facebook page
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.360]  saying that they own this building,
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.000]  they wouldn't mind it being used.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.480]  And there's nothing wrong with it really,
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.260]  except it just needs a full build-out down to the studs.
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.100]  Oh, shit.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.660]  And I don't think that's in our budget for starting off.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:30.540]  So we're looking for something more move-in ready.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.700]  Labor's cheap here, bro.
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.260]  Yeah, it's true. Labor is cheap in Puebla.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.100]  That's true.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.540]  We need some volunteers out there.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:37.060]  There you go.
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:39.140]  Yeah, it's hard to get volunteers, but it's cheap.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:39.980]  Right.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:40.820]  Yeah.
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:43.580]  Yeah, you know, a full build-out looks like
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.260]  it might be out of reach for, you know, just starting.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.100]  There are lots of vacant buildings in this town,
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.340]  some that are very suitable.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:50.980]  Unfortunately, there are a lot,
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.180]  but fortunately for yourself,
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.720]  there are a lot of vacant buildings.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.560]  Yeah.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.040]  We're in a weird transition in this town.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.480]  I haven't seen this town like this in a while.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.640]  We took off and we got really soared,
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:00.800]  and then suddenly we just started
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.040]  to kind of get empty-ish in some spots.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040]  Yeah, I'm thinking that, you know,
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.640]  I lived in Austin 20 years,
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.920]  and when I moved to Austin,
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.400]  the vibe was a lot like it is here right now.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.680]  It just really feels like this place is about to pop.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.320]  Okay, looks good to feel that from an outsider.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.800]  And I'm really trying, all of you out there
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.000]  in the MMJ, RMJ business, you know,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.380]  if you're looking for somebody who's smart
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.620]  or knows logistics, operations,
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.460]  I'm open to working with other companies.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.820]  My current gig is not a full-time gig.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.300]  I'm only about within about five hours a week right now.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.420]  You know, of course, that'll grow as things go,
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:37.740]  but I'm also open to other opportunities.
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.220]  And just talk to me, you know.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.580]  I'm also open to volunteering,
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:44.980]  helping people out for free.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.700]  You know, if you got a business,
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.540]  you don't know where it's going,
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.960]  and you really believe, like Ross DeJeff here believes,
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.160]  I'll give you some free advice.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.280]  I'll introduce you to the people I know.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.560]  If there's anything I can do for you, I'll do that.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.040]  But just from the short time we spoke
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.360]  at the hookah lounge that night,
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.040]  I could tell you knew what you were talking about.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.640]  That's half of what ended up letting you come on the show.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.520]  You know, I was like, this guy's got some shit to say.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.840]  Yeah, it's really weird,
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.280]  because I'm in that weird transition.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.840]  You know, I've been going to school.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.200]  You know, I'm older, I've had a career in sales,
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.800]  which, you know, I was a mid-grade salesman.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.560]  I made a good living, you know,
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.380]  and that was just fine with me.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.780]  And then I got divorced and wanted to change my life.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:23.900]  I decided to go back to school,
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.660]  maybe reach my full potential.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.060]  And I'm very confident in my skills.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.580]  You know, I just would like to meet people
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:32.900]  who value those skills and who can benefit from them.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.060]  And I prefer those people to be, you know,
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.780]  people who believe in the things
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.380]  that I believe in, like Jeff does.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.500]  Things work so much better when we believe in it.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.340]  Yeah.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.160]  So much better.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.500]  I like your, nobody wants to teach anybody
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.420]  to teach or how to make burgers.
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.260]  Right.
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.740]  Yeah, because nobody cares about their burger job.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.640]  Yeah, that sums it up.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.680]  Well, and you know, I mean,
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.200]  I want to do things I care about.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.120]  I sold cars for over five years.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.720]  Cars, you know, I want some of my soul back.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.240]  You know, I want to do things that matter.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.280]  We did a full episode on the Blocks podcast
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.200]  about a car dealer.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.020]  Right.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.400]  One specific salesman.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.280]  Yeah, so, you know, I've been at least part of that guy
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.120]  for a while.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.480]  So, you know what I mean?
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.600]  I'm a good guy and I'm looking to make a contribution
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.000]  that's gonna win.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.560]  I look forward to seeing what kind of mark you make.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.220]  We'll definitely be in business together.
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.260]  At least we'll be bros through the whole thing.
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.100]  Absolutely.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.700]  It's great to be here.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.220]  It's been like, you know, I'm a fan of you guys.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.020]  So it's been like a real honor to be on the show.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.860]  It's really cool.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.680]  I really appreciate it.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.520]  I like having just fans and people
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.060]  that we just relate to, you know?
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:31.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.740]  That makes a good podcast.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:33.660]  Just good conversation.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:35.540]  The reason I wanted to be on the show is that,
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.500]  you know, I find myself like responding
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.780]  to the things you guys are saying.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:39.820]  So I gotta be on there.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:40.940]  I talk back to podcasts.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.860]  Joe Rogan will say something and I'll respond.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.700]  Right.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.540]  I feel like an idiot in the car.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:45.380]  Exactly.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:47.060]  So, thanks for having me.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.240]  Oh man, thanks for coming on.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.400]  You got anything you want to end up with or?
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.360]  No, good.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.200]  Anything you want to bring up?
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.880]  Oh man, I'll probably put a little tag
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.100]  at the front and beginning of this.
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.640]  But guys, check out I Grow Culture.

[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.640]  It just feels good that my tweeter goes off.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.460]  That's all I want.
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:10.300]  So tweet me.

[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.440]  Tell me it's bad.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.960]  I want both types of feedback.

[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.720]  crime is down in Colorado and revenues are up in Colorado
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.520]  with the recent recreational marijuana law changes.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.520]  I'm gonna leave you with some John Brown's Body.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.600]  The song's called A Little Bit of Dub.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.120]  So until next time, take a fat dab,
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.440]  give your mom a hug for me.
[01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:47.450]  All right, watch on.
[01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:48.270]  Yeah.
[01:29:48.270 --> 01:30:28.340]  Yeah.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.620]  Happy hump day podcast world.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.180]  It's the I Grow Culture podcast.
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:34.620]  It's Rasta Jeff hanging out here with my buddy Kevin.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.460]  What up?
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.540]  We're burning all night.
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:40.420]  Nothing like a couple of white dudes with a microphone.
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:43.500]  We just sound the best.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.700]  We're awesome.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.540]  We're glad to be here.
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.380]  We're glad you're listening.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.340]  We're having a little bit of fun today.
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.540]  Taking some dabs.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.980]  I'm smoking out some dabs from Green Dot Labs.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:51.820]  That rhymes.
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:52.640]  Yeah.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.480]  That rhymes.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.300]  Yeah, it does.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.300]  We should be fucking rock stars, bro.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.300]  We should be rock stars.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.300]  I'm gonna drop this music out and we'll do a little talking.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:00.140]  Word.
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.020]  Hey, I can hear you now.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:01.860]  There you go.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.680]  That's awesome.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:05.100]  Oh, we're taking some dabs of some Green Dot Labs.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:05.940]  It tastes delicious.
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:06.760]  Good work, guys.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.600]  It does.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.440]  Great work.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.260]  Very, very yummy.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.500]  We're dabbing it out of a little mini tube
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.780]  that my buddy Solomon made.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.780]  Once again, great work, bro.
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:15.200]  I appreciate the little Rasta mini tube.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.140]  Look for pictures of that one on Instagram and Facebook.
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.700]  I posted pictures already.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:19.540]  Those are cool.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.100]  Welcome to episode number five
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.640]  of the iGrow Culture podcast.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.760]  We're coming back after an odd episode number four.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.000]  I appreciate you guys who listened to that.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.680]  I am on another podcast called 719 the Blocks.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:30.980]  We did a little combo.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.960]  That's some true fan action right there.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.960]  I tried to do Kill Two Birds with One Stone.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.900]  We had a guest show up
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.000]  that wanted to talk about cannabis a lot.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.920]  And so I figured we could share that.
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.080]  Then he interviewed me at the end.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.360]  So if you didn't listen to the whole thing,
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.720]  I got interviewed at the end of that
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.120]  and I played it on both podcast feeds.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.920]  So I hope you enjoyed.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.120]  Yeah, number five.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:53.960]  Before we go any further,

[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.740]  A little bit of musical credits.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.700]  At the end of episode three, that cool song I played,
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.060]  if you're wondering, that was called
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:31.500]  Unknown Number from an artist called Busy Signal.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.980]  Dig that tune.
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:33.940]  One of my personal favorites.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.820]  We just opened the show with Nice Up You, Meti
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:37.380]  from Morgan Heritage.
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:39.360]  I really dig those guys.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.460]  They do a lot of good reggae, a lot of weed songs.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:44.260]  So check out Morgan Heritage if you're into reggae.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:46.460]  Once again, give a big thanks to Gary and Wade

[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.880]  slash iGrowCulture podcast.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.360]  That was really fun.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.280]  It was kind of strange for me.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.200]  I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.080]  So we're sitting here with Kevin
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.560]  and we're talking about some stuff today.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.880]  Kev just got off work, came over,
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.440]  take a couple dabs in bullshit.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.800]  And I brought up a sore subject, bro.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.020]  The Ultimate Warrior is gone.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.520]  Growing up as a kid, bro,
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.900]  I remember watching all the wrestling
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.720]  and I didn't love anybody more than the Ultimate Warrior.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.120]  That was my dude.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.280]  You'd grab the ropes, shake the shit out of them,
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.540]  and the fireworks would go off behind him.
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:19.380]  Oh man.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.020]  There are many great wrestlers.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.940]  And at times I had switched my favorites,
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.980]  but I would have to say,
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:29.060]  if you told me to pick one from forever,
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.580]  the Ultimate Warrior would be the top of my list.
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.580]  The top dog, huh?
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.420]  Yeah.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:34.240]  The UW.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.080]  Yeah.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.380]  I think his face paint was stolen by the Wu-Tang Clan
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.620]  and they made their little Wu-Tang logo out of it.
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:42.500]  No, anybody?
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:43.340]  Anybody?
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.340]  All right.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.180]  Maybe I'm high.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:47.660]  What's your favorite battle
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.700]  with the Ultimate Warrior that you remember?
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.660]  It'd have to be Hulk Hogan.
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:54.500]  Me too, bro.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.340]  Me too.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.160]  I'm so glad you said that one.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.620]  WrestleMania is the most memorable
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.380]  wrestling event every year, so.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.500]  Didn't he push up Earthquake one time?
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.320]  Yes.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.160]  Did he lift Earthquake?
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.300]  That was another memorable moment for me.
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:12.220]  His charisma and his persona was unmatched, in my opinion.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:14.100]  I'd say the only one that had a,
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.440]  only person that has a comparable persona to that,
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.960]  in my opinion, is The Undertaker.
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.880]  And it's not as energetic,
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.880]  but the intensity of it is entirely there, so.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.620]  Absolutely.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.320]  I've kind of fallen out of wrestling.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.560]  I haven't watched in quite a while,
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.680]  but when I saw on Facebook that he killed himself,
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.000]  oh, did he kill himself?
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.840]  That's what I read, so I hope that's accurate.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.680]  I don't think so, no.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.520]  No?
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.000]  No, I think he had a heart attack.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  Okay.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.160]  I'm gonna Google that right quick,
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.400]  but once I saw that he was gone,
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.880]  I was kind of heartbroken.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.820]  I was like, oh man, so I'm gonna found,
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:49.660]  right here, WWE says,
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:51.620]  Ultimate Warrior found dead at 54.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.460]  I apologize if I jumped the gun
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:54.300]  and said he killed himself,
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.420]  because I read that on Facebook,
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:56.940]  and I don't trust Facebook.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:00.220]  Days after, oh, this website's playing music.
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:01.420]  I muted it for you.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:04.060]  Days after his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame,
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.180]  and I feel weird saying WWE.
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:07.000]  Yeah.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.060]  That was another letter back in the day.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:09.900]  Yep.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.200]  And yeah, he just got inducted
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.160]  right before WrestleMania on Sunday,
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.380]  so on Saturday, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.280]  Yeah.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.680]  Finally.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.680]  Yeah, the cause of death was not released,
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.200]  so I don't know.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.040]  I don't wanna speculate.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.680]  I apologize that I said the dude killed himself.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.000]  That's kind of rude for me to jump the gun,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:32.980]  but I saw that on Facebook,
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:35.900]  and I stupidly took that to heart.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.120]  So, the Ultimate Warrior is gone.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:39.980]  Man, we'll miss you, bro.
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:40.820]  I will.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:42.140]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.540]  That was when wrestling changed,
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.940]  was when he kind of, I don't wanna say fizzled,
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.100]  but when he disappeared from the scene,
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.180]  when he fizzled out,
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:49.980]  wrestling really changed right then.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.820]  Yep.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.020]  I wish I would've known more about the politics
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:54.200]  of what was going on in the background then.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.100]  Yeah.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.820]  Yep, so big up, Ultimate Warrior.
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.380]  We miss you, dude.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.220]  I'm shaking the ropes.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.040]  You can't see me do it,
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.260]  and I'm standing here shaking the ropes,
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.860]  and I'm doing a gorilla press.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.700]  Rawr!
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.140]  I should be wearing some ribbons.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:05.980]  Some armbands.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:07.260]  Some armbands or something.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.040]  Those things made his arms look huge.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:09.880]  Like.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.440]  They made his arms look bigger than they were.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.240]  That's funny.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.480]  You wanna take a dab, bro?
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.320]  Yeah, let's take a dab.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.160]  Let's take a dab from the Warrior.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.880]  Do you want the domeless or the domed?
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.040]  We got two little mini rigs sitting on the table.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.360]  I'll take the domeless, dude.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.200]  The domeless?
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.120]  Yeah.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:23.960]  Domeless?
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.200]  I actually like the way that guy hits.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.120]  Cool.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.240]  Yeah, I prefer the way the other one hits,
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.760]  but I think that one looks better.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.280]  So, they both win.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.120]  Yeah.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.000]  I think this one hits great.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.560]  We're gonna take some dabs.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.400]  I was at a dabs.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.540]  I was in Denver and I stupidly did not take enough
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.180]  concentrates with me and ended up getting really,
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:43.500]  like, you know, when you're out of town,
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.260]  you're like, oh, this is not enough dabs to have.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.220]  I had to have twice that.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:48.180]  So, I posted on Facebook,
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:49.620]  I needed some dabs and big shout outs
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.580]  to the people that helped me out.
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:54.140]  I got some super quality dabs from some friends,
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:54.980]  old and new.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.420]  I appreciate it.
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:57.260]  Right on to the people.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.260]  If you're listening, right on to the guys
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:00.220]  that let me sit on their couch and take a couple dabs
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.220]  after a show late last night in Denver
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.300]  before I had to drive home.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.140]  That was cool.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:05.260]  Got to use their D-nail.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.800]  Hell yeah, right on for letting Roz Jeff sit on your couch
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.640]  and take some dabs.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.320]  It always makes for a better ride home, you know?
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.160]  You don't want to leave.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:11.980]  For sure.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.280]  Leave what you're doing in Denver and then head right home.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.240]  You just feel rushed.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.560]  And I just wanted to go kick it for a minute.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.720]  And those guys were totally cool.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.560]  Nice.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.880]  I always have to show love to bad-ass people like that.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.160]  Cause you never know when I'm going to need
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.920]  some bad-ass folk like that.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.960]  I just like to go make new friends all over, bro.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.840]  I want to be everywhere.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.120]  Got, I realized I have something called a FOMO.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.240]  It's called the fear of missing out.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.060]  I've got that.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.960]  I don't want to miss anything.
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:36.500]  I have that as well.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.320]  It's hard to.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.300]  That's part of the reason I spend money I shouldn't spend.
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.420]  Yeah, me too.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.860]  I go places that I really didn't have time to go.
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:44.540]  And I don't want to get places I don't leave.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.780]  You notice I never leave the parties
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.780]  where we go dab out at the hookah bar.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:49.380]  We always plan to leave early.
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.220]  Yeah, never do.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:51.060]  Never.
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:51.880]  I'm going to take a dab.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:57.100]  It's part of the reason I can't really go out so much.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:00.260]  Cause I end up at places way too late.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:05.160]  And that just doesn't work out some of the time.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:06.360]  That was like a worm dab, bro.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.560]  That was good.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.520]  Some of the time you have shit to do.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.440]  I hope I don't got shit to do for a minute after that dab.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:15.840]  I'm doing a podcast, huh?
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.280]  Yeah, we are.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.400]  I can handle that dab.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.400]  That was, I think that's Casey Jones
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:22.840]  made by some friends of mine in Denver.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.660]  Shout out guys.
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:24.500]  Thank you.
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:25.340]  Good work.
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.160]  Super kind folks.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.000]  Yes.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.520]  We're going to hit this green dot here again in a minute.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:30.540]  That stuff's tasty.
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.780]  All right.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:33.880]  Excuse my cough.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:36.300]  So we do like to at least try to bring a little bit
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.580]  of information when we do a podcast with you guys.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.020]  We don't want to just ramble into your ears.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.820]  So search the news.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:45.100]  I want to give a big shout out to the Cannabis.
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:47.860]  They don't know it, but I find a lot of great news on there.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.460]  And I just share it with you guys.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.500]  Then I have a friend named Kevin who works with Pink House.
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.820]  He shares a lot of info with me.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:56.220]  So I filter through those and then Kevin and I sit here.
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:58.020]  Another dude named Kevin.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:58.980]  This is the Kevin.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.300]  Kev bro sit here.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:03.520]  Him and I sit here and we talk about what we should discuss.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.720]  He's got a lot of cool insights
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.040]  and a lot of good points he wants shared.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.880]  So he'll get some contributions going soon.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.960]  But after three months with legal marijuana
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:14.220]  Denver has not turned into an urban wasteland.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.800]  So this is from Radley Balco.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.800]  That's a cool fucking name, dude.
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.680]  Rad Balco.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.600]  That is pretty neat.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:24.920]  He writes for the Washington Post.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.160]  That's where this article comes from.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.000]  Right?
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:27.820]  Hey, what's up?
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:28.660]  My name is Rad.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.360]  Who's that?
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.840]  That's Rad.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.160]  I hope he wrote skateboards on his.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.440]  I hope he still skates on this.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.360]  I hope he never gives it up.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.720]  All right.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.200]  Thanks for letting me fuck with you, Rad.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.800]  You can tag that.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.640]  Radley.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.840]  That'd just be writing your fucking name on the wall though.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.000]  So you can't tag that.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.800]  What kind of graffiti artist are you?
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.200]  Just put your phone number while you're out there.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.400]  Yeah, sure.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:58.240]  Someone else could tag that and frame him.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.400]  No, that's just fucked up.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.640]  Don't give anyone that idea.
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.480]  All right.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.280]  So we've had legal marijuana for three months.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.360]  And this report says,
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.840]  after three months with legal marijuana,
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.920]  Denver has not turned into an urban wasteland.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.880]  In fact, as Vox reported this week,
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.680]  Denver crime in the first two months of 2014
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.720]  is down across the board from the first two months of 2013.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.920]  Yes, it's still early,
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.920]  but the numbers so far don't suggest
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.880]  that Denver is about to succumb to a crime wave
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.800]  fueled by pot addicted hooligans,
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.460]  as some law enforcement officials warned.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:32.860]  Us pot addicted hooligans haven't ravaged the town yet.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:33.700]  Proud of you guys.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:34.520]  You're doing well.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.360]  You're holding on to your shit.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.060]  Not a bunch.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.660]  Because we've just always had a problem with stoners
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:42.380]  just ravaging, tearing up shit.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.220]  Absolutely.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.040]  Stealing everything.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:44.880]  Everything.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.720]  We fucking exactly.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.020]  Killing people and we just fucking destroy.
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:48.860]  Destroy.
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:49.680]  That's what we do.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.520]  Yeah.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.340]  Because, and another thing,
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:52.180]  it's like,
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.700]  do they think we weren't smoking pot
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:54.620]  before it was legal?
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:55.460]  Right.
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.200]  We were doing that.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.040]  We just had to be.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.480]  Didn't have a record of how much was being purchased.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.280]  Had to commit a crime to go buy it.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.040]  Purchase it was fucking the crime we were committing then.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.400]  Now we're legit.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.120]  Now we are good law abiding citizens.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.400]  We mentioned on the last podcast,
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.320]  if you guys didn't mention or listen,
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.640]  one of the things they were worried about,
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.360]  they make money confiscating land and vehicles and money
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.040]  by doing weed raids.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.920]  And they were concerned they were going to lose that revenue,
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.160]  but we have surpassed that by pot sales.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.700]  So they're not worried like,
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.540]  oh yeah,
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.940]  we're going to make plenty of money to make up for that.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:31.460]  You can have your fucking confiscated vehicles and shit.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.280]  That's cool.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:35.580]  So I'm going to continue.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:38.220]  Whoa.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.340]  That can't be the next paragraph to the same story.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:41.180]  Wow.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.020]  It is.
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.500]  It says a 25 year old is shot dead trying to sell marijuana
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.780]  the old fashioned illegal way.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:46.340]  Two men from Texas set up a warehouse
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:48.260]  to grow more than they would ever need.
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.060]  And three people buying pot in a grocery store parking lot
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.960]  are robbed at gunpoint.
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.540]  While no one expected the state's first in the nation,
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.220]  recreational sales would eliminate the need
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.880]  for dangerous underground sales overnight.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.380]  The violence has raised concerns among police prosecutors
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:04.000]  and pot advocates that the black market for marijuana
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.220]  is alive and well in Colorado.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:11.340]  Indeed the black market is alive and well here in Colorado.
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.580]  It's the beautiful rainbowy market.
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.100]  It's not black, dude.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.420]  It's not ridiculously overpriced.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:22.080]  It's not under trimmed, under cured, under purged.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.820]  The black market is beautiful
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.020]  because they don't have to rush anything.
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.060]  They don't have to mass produce anything.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.900]  I hope we can try to figure out a way
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:36.500]  to get the quality of the black market to the dispensaries
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.500]  and shops one of these days.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.260]  But, and also the pricing keeps people
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:42.220]  from wanting to go to the dispensaries.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:45.300]  You're nodding.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:46.120]  Kevin's nodding.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:46.960]  Kevin agrees.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.800]  Don't have to pay taxes.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.940]  Right.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.740]  And you can sit on the couch while you're there
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.600]  and you're blaze a bowl
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.440]  and you don't have to stand in line and wait.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.840]  Some people don't like that shit.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.560]  Some people just wanna go fucking buy some weed and leave.
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.400]  Right, and those people are going to the stores.
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.360]  And I feel that there's gonna be,
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.840]  and that's why the black market will exist.
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.540]  There's the option for both still.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:09.160]  Some of the older cats we know will not go into dispensaries.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:11.240]  They're afraid of it.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.840]  They're paranoid by it for some reason.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.120]  They're all afraid of that list.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.840]  I don't wanna be on some list, man,
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.280]  is what we hear from a lot of the older cats.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:19.960]  And so my response used to be,
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.900]  so you just wanna get arrested for illegal weed?
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:23.220]  Like if you just get on that list,
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:25.460]  that list says you can carry pot.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.100]  But I think I did that thing my grandma used to say,
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.580]  which is I digress.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.140]  I've never said that before.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.460]  I think it sounds funny.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.220]  I was doing it though.
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.420]  The article continues with scary stories
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.700]  from Denver and its suburbs.
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:43.180]  But wait, crime is down in Denver, isn't it?
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.420]  Which is why the AP has only anecdotes.
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.660]  One paragraph is the closest the article comes to
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:49.420]  attempting to find actual figures.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.900]  It's difficult to measure whether there has been
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:55.580]  an increase in pot-related crimes beyond anecdotal reports
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:58.060]  because no one at either side, the federal or state level,
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.860]  is keeping track of numbers of killings,
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:02.960]  robberies, and other crimes linked directly to marijuana.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:08.060]  Have we had any major marijuana murders lately?
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:09.260]  Has there been?
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.700]  Have there been any unsolved weed murders?
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:18.300]  Now I'll admit there have been a few break-ins
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.320]  and small residual crimes resulting,
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.120]  but nothing shit happens no matter what you're doing.
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.360]  You know, with the population.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.760]  Nothing a 7-Eleven doesn't deal with.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.600]  Right.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.520]  Less than what a 7-Eleven would deal with
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.560]  because at a 7-Eleven you usually find
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.000]  a couple of homeless dudes out front looking for cigarettes.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.600]  There's that one weird guy that seems to be
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.360]  leaning up against the payphone at every 7-Eleven.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.520]  That's more riffraff than you see the dispensaries
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.360]  don't allow that.
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.180]  They rush you off.
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.840]  You can't hang out here, homeless guy.
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.380]  You look like you're bad for business.
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.800]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.940]  Oh man, that's kind of weird.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:55.380]  All right, did I scroll down?
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:56.220]  I don't want to.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:59.420]  Okay, so violent property crimes are down in Denver
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.340]  and we have no way of knowing how many of the crimes
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.460]  have been committed related to legalized marijuana.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.380]  Yet the AP, the Associated Press,
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:07.300]  goes ahead and quotes law enforcement officials
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:10.620]  who say the entire region is erupting into chaos.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.500]  I was there last night and I didn't see much chaos.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.660]  Most chaos I saw was inside the comedy show
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.080]  and it was hilarious.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.160]  But the same people who predicted as much before
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.540]  legalization took effect and so of course
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.800]  have an interest in seeing it come to pass.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.960]  These people predicted that we were going to fail
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.880]  and so they want to see us fail.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:30.000]  They want to be right.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.840]  They're haters.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.160]  They just want to be right.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.000]  There are some three million people
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.360]  in the Denver metropolitan area.
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.080]  All of them are trying to park in the same fucking
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.440]  parking spot last night, I think.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.280]  I was there last night.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.320]  I had some fun.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.340]  There will be some crime whether pot is legal or not.
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:50.780]  And there will be crimes that in some way involve pot,
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.140]  whether pot is legal or not.
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.020]  Just as there are crimes related to alcohol,
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.340]  money, sex, and charity hockey games.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.740]  Why did they pick charity hockey games?
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:00.180]  Because people fight.
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.500]  Well yeah, it's just random.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.260]  They wanted to pick something obscure
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.620]  and charity hockey games was what the editor
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:06.460]  let them run with.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.380]  It happens.
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:11.740]  So this is what we're saying.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:15.160]  There's just as many crimes related to the liquor stores
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.000]  and money.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.440]  Money's got plenty of crime attached to it.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.360]  The banking systems, sex, prostitution
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.840]  has plenty of money attached to that.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:23.680]  So they go on to say,
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:26.520]  it's also certainly possible that the high tax on pot
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.440]  in Colorado has enabled black markets to continue and exist.
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.480]  That's kind of what I was hinting at earlier.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:35.680]  That 25% tax makes, street weed is cheap.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.460]  If you know the right people,
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.040]  if you're hooked up and if you've been here for a while,
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.340]  you probably know where there's a $30 eighth.
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:43.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.700]  You could probably find $175 ounce if you shopped around.
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:46.540]  Yeah.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:47.360]  Yeah.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.620]  If you don't care too much about quality,
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:50.540]  you can find $150 ounce around here
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:51.820]  from one of your friends.
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:52.660]  Yeah.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.500]  If you buy that same $150 ounce,
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:58.140]  which that's not going to happen at a dispensary.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:58.980]  No.
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:02.060]  Well, some of the medical places, sometimes you can.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:02.900]  Yeah.
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:04.220]  Well, that doesn't count for what I'm getting at
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:06.060]  because I'm just headed for recreational.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:06.980]  Yeah, the rec shops.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:07.820]  That doesn't happen.
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:10.020]  You're going to pay 200 at least.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.800]  Yeah.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:12.640]  Closer to five.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.920]  Like I've seen them go for 450 in the rec shops.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.760]  Yeah.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.280]  It's yeah, like 450 or so.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.800]  So you're paying almost a hundred bucks tax.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.640]  Yeah.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.720]  If it's $400, you're paying a hundred bucks tax.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.880]  Close to a hundred bucks tax.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.880]  Ouch.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.500]  17.4% at the point of sale.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.000]  Man, that's a lot of taxes, dude.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.080]  So that's, and then that's exactly
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.160]  the black market will continue to exist.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.240]  This guy says, I oppose.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.140]  It's also at least possible that pot is fueling crime
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:42.740]  that were it not for legalization,
[01:47:42.740 --> 01:47:44.320]  both violent and property crime
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.420]  would have fallen even more.
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.260]  How so?
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.060]  What?
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.620]  If somebody can tweet me how legalized marijuana
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:55.860]  contributes to crime, I would appreciate it.
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:58.300]  Like street crime, there's legalized cannabis,
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.340]  how it's causing, how it would contribute,
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:03.460]  how it would prevent crime rates from going down.
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:04.380]  Let me know.
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.940]  Cause maybe I'm missing something.
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.140]  I like to have an open mind.
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.520]  Yeah, I don't really have much of input on that.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.760]  Cause I would say the same point you have.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.840]  If you have some kind of evidence that can show me that,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.920]  go ahead.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.760]  Yeah.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.580]  Drop a line.
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:21.880]  Almost, I would say 90% of the people
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.720]  we hang out with are cannabis consumers.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.560]  I'd say probably a hundred percent of the people
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.160]  I hang out with are dudes.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.400]  Like I'm not even.
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.240]  Yeah.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.440]  Yeah. At some point.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.280]  Yeah. At some point,
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.200]  I think they've all gotten stoned with us.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.260]  All of our friends puffed down once in a while with us.
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.380]  At least.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:43.500]  We aren't bad people, dude.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.220]  We're not criminals.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:47.900]  And now that cannabis is not illegal,
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:49.540]  we aren't committing any crimes.
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:50.380]  None of us are.
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:52.060]  Totally legit.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.660]  Yeah. I don't see how they're coming up with that.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:56.300]  And this article agrees with us.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:58.900]  This article is kind of saying the same thing as us.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:48:59.980]  They're like, where is that?
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:01.740]  So they continue, this is the last paragraph.
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:03.180]  It says, but that's all speculation.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.140]  There's no evidence that any of those things are happening.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.600]  All we have are some anecdotes from law enforcement.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.160]  So perhaps journalists should hold off
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.680]  on the panicky stories and pot field crime waves,
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.680]  especially since the early data
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:17.480]  show that crime has actually dropped.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.320]  So crime's going down,
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.800]  you guys legalize cannabis and crime drops.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.120]  So they're just saying shit.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.320]  And the data actually says that it dropped.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.680]  And so the law enforcement and people
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:29.920]  are just saying things.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.760]  You know what that reminds me of?
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.840]  They're just saying things.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.600]  You ever had a white girlfriend who's fucking wasted?
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.720]  They're like, damn, you're drunk.
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.620]  And she goes, I'm not drunk.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:40.620]  That's the same kind of bullshit.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:41.740]  And they think we're gonna just go,
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:42.780]  oh yeah, you're not drunk.
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:44.000]  Okay, cool.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:45.980]  I don't know.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:47.540]  I bet you're drunk.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:49.700]  I'm not drunk.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:53.120]  And so while all the while we're lowering crime,
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:56.540]  Colorado rakes in.
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.140]  So we're gonna say raising revenue.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:00.820]  Uh-huh, Colorado marijuana tax revenues total
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:04.780]  $3.2 million in February.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.040]  Tax revenues from Colorado's medical
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.240]  and recreational marijuana sales in February
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.600]  increased from the previous month,
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.400]  according to figures released Wednesday by the state.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:17.480]  Colorado collected $3.2 million in February,
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.000]  below the state's projection of 3.7 million,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  but slightly above the 2.9 million it gathered in January.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.080]  Holy crap, dude.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.520]  That's partly because I bet some of the out of staters
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:31.840]  that did come and buy weed,
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.640]  they actually went home and told a bunch of their friends,
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.140]  yeah, you can actually go buy weed.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:35.980]  We've seen it.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:38.060]  I've heard stories of,
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.060]  I've got plenty of you friends that work in dispensaries,
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:41.220]  but one guy will show up,
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.820]  they'd be like, I'm from Texas, sorry.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:45.580]  I just dissed all of Texas trying to do a Texas voice.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:46.780]  Guy'll show up and say he's from Texas,
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:48.820]  he'll come by himself and by his limit.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.740]  And then he'll show up next time with two friends
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.140]  and they'll both buy their limit,
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:52.980]  or they're all three,
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.780]  and then he'll come with a truckload next time.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:56.620]  Yeah, I brought it.
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:57.540]  Yeah, they do.
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:59.180]  Daryl and Daryl and Larry and Larry,
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:01.780]  and we're all here to buy a whole bunch of weed.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.560]  I'm sure they hit every shop that they can to.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:04.960]  It's intense.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:05.800]  Yeah.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:07.840]  That's a lot of money, dude.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.160]  I hope they do good things with that.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.000]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.240]  I haven't seen anything improve around here.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:16.480]  They got beer taps installed at the house.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:22.400]  If you guys could see the look on my face right now.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.800]  All right, in February,
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.360]  I mean, no, don't even get me going, bro.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.000]  In February, Colorado collected 1.43 million
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.200]  from a special 10% sales tax on recreational marijuana,
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.340]  plus another $438,253
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:39.240]  from the state's standard 2.9% sales tax.
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.900]  My God, fix some fucking streets and highways, will you?
[01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:45.060]  Those potholes are fucking me up, dude.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:47.580]  The 2.9% sales tax on medical marijuana
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:51.740]  produced revenues of, what is that?
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:54.220]  Oh, it's 1.022,
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.540]  and then it's a whole nother paragraph
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.940]  because of the way this page advertised.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.500]  1.022 million in February,
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:04.600]  an increase from the 913,000,
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.240]  what the fuck, how much money?
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:10.240]  $913,519 collected in January,
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.920]  and far above the $791,000 the state
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.940]  had projected in February.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.600]  Conversely, the state projected that the 15% excise tax
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:23.140]  on the sale of recreational marijuana
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:27.520]  would bring in $739,330.
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:30.040]  The actual total was $339,615,
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:36.260]  which is 54% below expectations.
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:38.300]  The 15% excise tax produced
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:43.380]  $195,318 in January.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:44.620]  I'm trying to read ahead.
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:48.060]  I see other states reading this article.
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:52.460]  Somebody, some governor in some small town is going,
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.140]  holy shit, they made more money on weed
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:57.500]  than our whole town made.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:52:59.320]  This year.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.480]  For sure.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:03.280]  There's probably some states that are like,
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.240]  the whole state made.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.120]  Yeah, what's like a little tiny state,
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.440]  something like Rhode Island or something
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.280]  that's like a block long?
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.800]  Like, holy shit.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Man, as was the case in January,
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.240]  Denver generated the largest amount of tax revenue
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.920]  with a 2.9% sales tax on medical marijuana,
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.360]  totaling $483,432.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.080]  Can I have just a pinch of all this funding
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.280]  that's being thrown around?
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.280]  The 2.9% tax on retail pot brought in $245,709
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:41.720]  with a 10% sales tax adding another $710,930.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.400]  Since that number was 710, we're gonna take a dab.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:46.240]  Boom.
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.200]  Join us for a dab, guys.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:48.840]  We're gonna do some of the,
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.680]  I think we need a dab of the green dot.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.320]  This stuff is tasty.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.360]  Will you pass me your dabber, bro?
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:54.360]  It's a little out of my reach.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.200]  Yep, I got you.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.320]  Yeah, thank you, bro.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.980]  Make it worth your reach.
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:58.820]  Bam.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:01.180]  And move this guy over.
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:03.980]  Gotta get prepared, you guys.
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:06.700]  Gotta get some more pins at the Cannabis Cup, dude.
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:08.180]  Yeah, you a pin collector now?
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.420]  Yeah, I like my pins.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:11.200]  The Handmade Apparel Crew.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:12.580]  I'm not a pin guy.
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.100]  I'm just trying to avoid that.
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.540]  I'll take all those pins for you
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.700]  if they're gonna hook you up with some pins.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.180]  Their idea is to hook me up.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:20.620]  They wanna make me one of them.
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.420]  And I'm like, no, I don't think I want,
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:24.260]  just no offense to you guys with all the pins.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.040]  I don't wanna follow every trend that there is.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:27.960]  You know, I've got dreadlocks,
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:30.960]  and if those pins get stuck in my dreads under my hat,
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.760]  that's gonna be fucking murder.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:33.840]  That's part of my problem.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.560]  But I don't wanna follow every trend.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.560]  I'm a little bit older than a lot of you guys.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:38.520]  I like the pins
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:42.040]  because I can support several companies daily,
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.260]  and I can all at once.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.560]  Whereas shirts, I gotta do one a day
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.060]  or have a ridiculously fucked up looking shirt.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.400]  Looks like a fucking NASCAR driver.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:55.340]  You got 72, you got Sweet Stone,
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.780]  and highly educated on you.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.860]  Shout out to those guys.
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:00.780]  I'll take the pins before the NASCAR jacket.
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:02.660]  So if anybody wants to throw down some pins
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.860]  to the Agriculture Podcast,
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.500]  Kevin needs a couple more for his hat.
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.740]  Yep, I'll make my hat heavy as shit.
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.340]  I have four or five pins.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.700]  And that's, you know, if TAS made a pin,
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:15.860]  if we had a highly educated pin, I'd rock that.
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:17.980]  And if there was a Sweet Stone pin,
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:20.100]  I may put that one on a hat.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.620]  But I feel I'm a minimalist.
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:24.840]  And I feel if I put 20 on there,
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.440]  that takes away from each one.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.040]  If I have two, then each of those
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:30.040]  must be my fucking favorite.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:30.880]  But you pin guys just go,
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.600]  huh, poser, you only got two pins?
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.000]  That's what you guys think.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.340]  I have meaning behind all of my pins.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.860]  So, I'll just buy all kinds of pins.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:45.240]  Otherwise I'd have a shit load, dude.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.680]  We're about to dab Setsuma Shatter,
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:49.840]  extracted with N-butane,
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:52.180]  grown and extracted by Green Dot Labs.
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.500]  Guys, it smells wonderful.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.620]  I wish you could smell this through the phone.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:57.780]  Let's do it, bro.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:58.940]  He's counting his pins over here.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:01.220]  He's loving it.
[01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.620]  He's got Shatter Dragons, you guys.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:04.140]  I'm proud of him for the Shatter Dragons.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.180]  I need to get me a couple more of those.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:08.100]  That new crest they made, bro.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:08.980]  I know.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:10.180]  Dopeness.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:11.420]  I know.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.860]  Dopeness.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:14.620]  Hey, what kind of nail is that on that rig?
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:17.380]  That's a highly educated nail.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:18.780]  It's a duality.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.760]  It's a 14 or an 18.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:21.600]  Alita.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:22.440]  Domeless.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:24.720]  Shout out to TASC.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:26.800]  That was a shameless plug for you, TASC Rock.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:29.000]  I only use highly educated stuff.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:29.840]  Once TASC sat down and taught me.
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:32.120]  I'm telling everybody else to use highly educated stuff.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.440]  Once you sat down and taught me about it,
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  I was like, dude, there's a reason
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.760]  why you're crushing the game.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.240]  All right, excuse us while we dab.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.080]  Dab with us.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.000]  Drop a dab right now.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.600]  Must be a quarter gram to count.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.280]  Oh.
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:47.980]  Oh.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.380]  Mini tube mafia.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.420]  I love these little tiny rigs, dude.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:56.380]  I get so dabbed from them.
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:56:57.220]  I love them too.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.260]  All right, Kevin's gonna cough for a minute.
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:04.700]  I'm gonna attempt to read the rest of this.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:07.500]  If you guys forgot, we're talking about how much money
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.500]  Colorado made from the sales of cannabis.
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.580]  And what I'm trying to do is encourage
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.900]  other states to join in.
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.300]  I'm just hoping that somebody who makes rules
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:16.320]  is listening to how much money these people made.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.560]  Because when you see other people making money,
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.860]  you want some, or you hate them.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:21.600]  Like right away, you're like,
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:22.700]  that fucker's doing better than me.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:23.960]  I don't like him anymore.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.200]  Just inspires me to do better.
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.040]  So I hope other states see all this money we're making
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:28.880]  and want to jump in.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.880]  I'm gonna read now to stop setting in.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.560]  In just a few months,
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.160]  just a few months into the first year
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:36.000]  of legalized recreational marijuana sales,
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.840]  finding certainty when it comes to pot revenues
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:41.040]  has proven to be elusive.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.960]  In February, Governor John Hickenlooper's budget office
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:46.420]  predicted tax and fee revenues for marijuana
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:51.200]  would total about $134 million in the fiscal year.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:53.140]  However, a month later,
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.780]  the state's legislative council said
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:56.680]  the total would be half as much.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:59.100]  What happened?
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:01.140]  The legislators joint budget committee on Tuesday
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.780]  pledged to craft a bill that would force the state to wait
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.020]  until it had actual figures
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:07.620]  before spending the revenues from marijuana.
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:08.860]  That's what a drug dealer would do too.
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:11.700]  You wait before you spend your shit if you're right.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:14.000]  This story was first published on the denverpost.com
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.800]  and I read it from the cannabis.
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:17.160]  I feel like I should give them credit often
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:19.440]  because they helped the show out a lot
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.240]  just by posting all this good shit.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.920]  What do you think about all that money, Kev?
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.400]  I think it's a lot of fucking money
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.400]  and they should do something awesome with it
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.920]  instead of squatting it.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.400]  Yeah. Instead of crap.
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:33.680]  Well, I guess they can't do anything
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.240]  until they've got actual figures.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.760]  So they can't spend any of it.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:38.360]  I agree with that.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.120]  I think that should be.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.460]  You can't spend your money until you fucking have it.
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.140]  Yeah. I agree with you there.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:48.860]  So it seems like we're on a good roll with news.
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:49.860]  I'm going to read one more thing
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:52.500]  and then we're going to chat for a second here.
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.060]  I've got something I want to rant about
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:57.620]  after I read this article. The Denver County Fair.
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:00.980]  Ben, Kevin and I had a little talk about this.
[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:03.120]  The Denver County Fair is doing something
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.900]  that I find revolutionary and I'm impressed.
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:09.300]  The Denver County Fair has been known for being
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:11.940]  not your normal county fair.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:13.860]  They've had some weird and freaky exhibits
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:15.500]  before and crazier events
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:18.540]  and I guess counterculture type stuff.
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.380]  So in an article that was on the Denver Post
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:26.060]  written by Steve Rab, I hope I didn't butcher your name.
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:28.380]  There's two A's in a row there and that always fucks me up.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.380]  What are you doing with two A's in a row?
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:33.660]  I don't know. R-A-A-B-E.
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.980]  Is that Rabe or Rab?
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.580]  Either way, he wrote a cool article
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:39.220]  and I'm going to share it with you guys.
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:40.600]  I hope that's not fucking rude to just diss
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.280]  on that guy's name like that. It's a podcast.
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:46.080]  So pot plant growing competitions, pot brownie judging,
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.520]  pipes, vaporizers.
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:49.200]  I'm going to read this like we're at a commercial.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:52.240]  Pot plant growing competitions, pot brownie judging,
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.440]  pipes, vaporizers, rolling papers.
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:57.440]  Oh, and by the way, there's also a county fair taking place.
[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.920]  County fair.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:00.920]  Do the fair, do the ...
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.520]  That's a Colorado State Fair one, huh?
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.880]  Anyway, so but excuse the Denver County Fair goers
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:10.180]  for making hay with marijuana while public interest is high.
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.100]  That's such a great ... I read it all fucked up
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.140]  because I was trying not to laugh.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.860]  Even the first time I read it, I laughed out loud.
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:18.220]  Organizers said Tuesday that the fair's pot pavilion
[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.980]  will now occupy the entire floor
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.300]  of the National Western Complex during the event,
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:24.180]  which is August 1st through 3rd.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:27.500]  Originally, the pot pavilion was going to take
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:30.820]  just half of the third floor, said fair director Dana Kane,
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:33.140]  but the response has just been enormous.
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:35.060]  We're having to turn away sponsors.
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:38.540]  So the fair is kind of a weird place to go
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:40.100]  until we introduce weed,
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:42.020]  and now they have to turn down sponsors.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:44.980]  That's pretty neat.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:48.500]  So there will be no actual cannabis on the premises.
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:52.220]  Plant and brownie judging will take place offsite,
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.820]  then shown via video at the pot pavilion,
[02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:57.620]  but sponsors and vendors will be showing
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.340]  and selling smoking accessories.
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:02.620]  You think they'll be dabbing?
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.960]  They're going to be selling and showing smoking accessories.
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.800]  I don't think so.
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:12.040]  Entrance to the third floor will be restricted
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.640]  to age 21 and over.
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.200]  We've been to some places where I don't think
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:21.280]  they intended us for us to dab in there.
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:22.640]  Sorry, guys, I'm dabbed out. I know I'm talking-
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:23.840]  We all just started doing it.
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:25.040]  We just started doing it.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.400]  Everybody. The owner walked around
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.400]  and looked at everybody like, what, what, you, what, what?
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:30.880]  And he realized if he kicked us out, we're all leaving,
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:32.740]  and so he just let us dab in there.
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:35.140]  And I know it's the fair,
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:39.340]  but there are booths and shit, dude, and we just start dabbing.
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:42.580]  I may go to this event. I don't live near there,
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:44.460]  but I may go just for shits and giggles.
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:46.700]  I think. I might be wrong,
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:49.340]  but I think that first week is the secret cup.
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:51.820]  Hey, now. First week of August.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.180]  Hey, now. Secret cup.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:55.260]  I think. I think.
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:58.260]  We'll be there. Even if we're not competing, we'll be there.
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.840]  Means we got to grow some weed.
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:03.040]  Get a special crop selected for that.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.560]  Yeah, we got to figure out what we're doing.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:05.640]  We'll talk about that off the air.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.120]  Nobody can know what we're going to run for that.
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.240]  Don't get to know. It's a secret.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:11.120]  It's a secret. Shh.
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:14.800]  All right. Prizes will be given for fastest joint
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:18.440]  rolling using oregano in place of weed,
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.800]  but they're going to do that at a big table or some shit,
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.000]  you know, so that people can watch.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  You know, whoever rolls the fastest joint gets a prize,
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  but part of rolling a good joint is making it burn good.
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.740]  You got to smoke that fucker.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:32.580]  Pot Pavilion sponsor, Medically Correct,
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:34.980]  will be arranging shuttle rides to nearby dispensaries
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:36.900]  and recreational stores.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:39.140]  I urge some shops to get on that shit.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.540]  Make some money.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:42.620]  Kane noted that the Pot Pavilion's poster,
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:46.580]  a cherry pie with a crust cut out resembling a marijuana leaf
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:50.100]  is outselling the fair's main poster by a 10 to 1 ratio.
[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:54.980]  So more people want to buy this ad with the weed leaf on it
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:57.540]  for a poster for the show or for the fair.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:02:59.580]  Which I find entertaining.
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:02.100]  Well, people from out of town find it fascinating, bro.
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:05.620]  They really do. People wanted, I have a friend from New Mexico
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.460]  and he wanted my, just my empty packaging from a dispensary.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:10.100]  He's like, I just want to show this to my friends.
[02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:11.300]  And I was like, that's weird.
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:14.420]  People want receipts just to take back and show
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.620]  and people want to frame it and shit.
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:18.700]  I haven't, I bought weed on the first.
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:20.740]  I was the first person, I know I keep repeating this.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:22.620]  I'm proud. I was the first person to buy recreational
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:26.140]  cannabis at the Greener Side dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:28.160]  And I still have the weed that I bought sealed
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.920]  in the package that they sold it to me
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.280]  and in which they sold it to me.
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.020]  It's in that package still.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:35.940]  It's on my desk.
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:38.400]  I marvel at it once in a while.
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:39.920]  You're never going to hit it, are you?
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.480]  I might one day.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.520]  The novelty is wearing off.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.320]  The novelty is wearing off.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:49.080]  You know how much you could sell that for in like 10 years?
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:49.920]  In like 10 years?
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:51.120]  Would it be illegal though?
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:52.500]  Or could I just sell it for nostalgic?
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.360]  Well, no, in 10 years, dude.
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.480]  Be like collectible.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:58.540]  I have the receipt as well so I could keep it with it.
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:00.300]  You'd like put it all in a frame?
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:01.780]  In 10 years, we won't have to worry about me
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:03.180]  trying to sell that to somebody
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.020]  because we'll just be able to,
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.620]  I could ship it to wherever and they won't care.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:06.780]  Like, oh, it's just weed.
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:07.620]  It's just weed.
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:08.460]  It'd be completely illegal.
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:09.300]  It's fucking weed in a jar.
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.780]  It's just fucking weed, yep.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.020]  In a little brown baggie.
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:13.580]  It's not going to hurt anything.
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:15.900]  Not going to hurt anything.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:16.820]  That's the truth.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:22.420]  We were going to talk about the dude
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.240]  that ate an edible and jumped from a balcony.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:28.400]  I am delimited on my facts on that.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:32.560]  I hate to talk about shit that I don't have fact on.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.600]  Okay, we should just, somebody ate.
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.700]  I hate to, if you look it up, it'll pop up
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.360]  and you could probably look all kinds of shit up on it
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.200]  and read about a lot of it, but I haven't done it
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.600]  so I don't want to express.
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.480]  All right, we'll skip that.
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:51.880]  We should respect him and his family anyway.
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:53.740]  You guys should read about that if you're interested.
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:56.180]  The guy that jumped after he ate an edible.
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:57.100]  It's kind of weird.
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:05:02.100]  It is being debated as the possible death from marijuana,
[02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:06.540]  which I highly doubt.
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:10.900]  I think some other things were affecting that shit.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:13.880]  So, but like I said, I don't know enough to.
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:17.260]  Yeah, and it's not on the website that I saw it on before.
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:19.460]  It's disappeared, so I don't know what happened to it.
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:21.060]  Yeah, I was looking for it.
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.840]  I find that odd that it's gone.
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:23.680]  That is odd.
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:25.880]  Yeah, so we can't talk about that.
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:27.440]  Hey, I said I had a rant.
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.120]  Yes, you did.
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.280]  People in Colorado and I'm gonna get some hatred
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:34.680]  and some backlash, but guys,
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:38.200]  stop shipping weed out of state.
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.200]  Oh my God, please.
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.020]  You just sound like a chick.
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:43.040]  Oh my God, please, but he's right.
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.360]  No, please. Oh my God, please.
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.000]  You're so fucking stupid.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.800]  But there's a couple of things that suck about that.
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:48.760]  We worked hard.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.560]  I can't, I'm not gonna take any credit,
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:52.700]  but the people that got this happening
[02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:57.080]  worked really hard to get cannabis legalized for us,
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:01.060]  and we're shipping it to, we're low on weed
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.060]  because we have medical,
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:04.460]  there are medical patients that are not getting cannabis
[02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:08.460]  because the shops have more profit
[02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:10.460]  by selling it recreationally.
[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:11.620]  So there are medical patients
[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:12.740]  that are now not getting their weed.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:14.460]  I've ranted about this on another episode,
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:16.900]  but that weed that you're growing
[02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:18.620]  could go to somebody in Colorado
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:19.840]  that needs some medical weed
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:23.460]  instead of somebody in a state, five states away
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.340]  that just wants to make a little bit more money,
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:26.220]  and you're making more money
[02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:28.420]  off that pound that you're shipping.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.420]  Think about that,
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:32.340]  and it's not worth fucking up what we've worked for.
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:33.180]  No, not at all.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.380]  We put a lot of effort into this,
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:35.900]  and you're gonna get busted eventually.
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:38.580]  They're gonna start, this is my prediction,
[02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:40.240]  just like they're pulling people over out of state
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:41.700]  with Colorado plates, they're gonna start,
[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:42.980]  oh, this came from Colorado,
[02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:45.720]  and they're gonna start cutting open boxes.
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.800]  If nothing else, they're just gonna take your shit.
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:49.780]  If it's somebody, you know,
[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:52.260]  it's some young dude that's ambitious,
[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:53.300]  it's just jacking shit.
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.660]  If it's some old guy or some snooty old lady,
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:58.060]  some church lady, your box smells like reefer
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:00.020]  and says Colorado, she's gonna do what she can
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:01.700]  to find out what's in there.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:03.400]  So I guess eventually you'll get yours,
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.600]  you'll get your, that bad karma will come to you.
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.420]  I don't wish it upon you, but it'll happen, dude,
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:10.620]  and I don't want, we don't need a bunch of weed.
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:12.200]  It's gonna be a backlash on the community
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:14.140]  and the movement, not just the individual.
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:17.020]  Yeah, yeah, and we don't need more cannabis
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:18.560]  leaving Colorado.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.080]  It's hard enough to keep Colorado supplied,
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.240]  which in a couple of years, that won't be a problem.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:25.820]  We got, everybody's got gigantic plans
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:27.760]  and everyone's building fucking greenhouses
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.640]  at the side of the football stadiums.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:32.460]  But yeah, don't ship it.
[02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:34.480]  Come here, if you wanna drive home with it,
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.920]  if you wanna drive it somewhere,
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:38.660]  I don't even encourage you to drive in quantity somewhere,
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:40.940]  keep it in Colorado, get it to a patient that needs it.
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:43.240]  Patients will pay as well.
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.160]  Like you don't need to make an arm and a leg.
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:49.100]  I know how much weed you should be producing
[02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:50.260]  through a thousand watt light.
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.100]  And most of you guys, I know how much lights
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:54.940]  people are hanging now, so you're doing okay.
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:56.980]  You don't wanna be a baller or something.
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:00.740]  Get it to a patient, don't send it out of town.
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:03.980]  No disrespect, it's gonna fuck things up.
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:05.540]  I just don't wanna mess anything up
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:07.340]  because we've worked hard.
[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:09.540]  That's enough of that rant, I'm sorry, I apologize.
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:11.220]  I don't wanna go on about that.
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:12.300]  Bro, you were saying a lot of cool,
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:13.460]  Kevin, dude across from me,
[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:14.580]  I'm not just talking to all you bros,
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:15.780]  you were saying a lot of cool stuff
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:17.760]  about working at the shop.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:19.200]  We'll talk about which shop you work at.
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.200]  I don't know if you wanna do that on there or anything,
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:22.560]  but Kev's a bud tender.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.000]  What else do you do over there?
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:28.840]  Just clean up and bud tend and I give knowledge.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:31.480]  I'm pretty much their encyclopedia now.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.120]  And that's the part that kind of has me inspired
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:33.960]  to talk about this.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:34.800]  I really like it.
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:37.800]  I really enjoy that part of it,
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:41.040]  being able to sit and answer questions for people
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:42.640]  and give them cannabis knowledge
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:44.940]  and let them know how it'll help them
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:48.700]  or what might be better for them or why.
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:52.120]  It's just really neat to see someone come in
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:57.120]  that may have never had cannabis before,
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:59.860]  but had read some stuff about it
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.340]  and had decided to give it a try.
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:05.500]  And they come in very uncomfortable and unsure and uneasy,
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.820]  which if you don't know much about anything,
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:11.060]  you're gonna be like that with any kind of new thing.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:14.980]  And then after, by the time they leave
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.740]  and after I answer their questions and stuff,
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:20.860]  it's really nice that they're much more comfortable,
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.580]  they're happy, they're enthused,
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:24.660]  they're already feeling better
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:27.020]  and they haven't even had any of the medicine yet.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:28.620]  And that's awesome.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:30.620]  And part of that is just spiritual uplifting.
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:32.140]  That's really good for people.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:33.380]  That's good for your karma too, bro.
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:35.060]  So you're definitely gonna get some love back
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:36.060]  from the world for that.
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.660]  It's my favorite part of my job, for sure.
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:44.000]  I like doing that more than I like selling anything.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.840]  How many of your customers do you think
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.040]  are from out of state?
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.960]  What percentage would you say?
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:52.760]  On the rec side, probably 60 or 70.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:53.680]  Wow.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:54.520]  There's a lot.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.840]  Is there a state that's like most popular
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:57.680]  or is it just kind of a mix?
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:58.520]  Texas.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:09:59.360]  A lot of, that's funny
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:00.200]  because I was making fun of Texas earlier.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:02.720]  Texas, like tons a day.
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:03.560]  Tons a day.
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:04.380]  Tons a day.
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:06.620]  Sometimes they're close to Pueblo's numbers.
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.360]  Wow.
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.520]  It's intense, dude.
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:12.900]  So Texas is driving home with a bunch of men.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:14.700]  Imagine having to drive,
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:16.240]  I'm gonna assume that's like 10 hours
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.080]  to get home to Texas.
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:17.920]  That's just a guess.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:18.740]  I don't have a map in front of me.
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:20.020]  About 12 for Austin.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:21.980]  Okay, 12 hours to drive home.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:24.620]  What if you could only buy a couple of quarters?
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:26.980]  Yeah, like.
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:28.420]  That's like us having to drive.
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:30.540]  Dude, we used to complain if we'd have to drive up
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:31.860]  to Denver to find some good weed.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.180]  We gotta go to a shop all the way, 100 miles away
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:35.980]  and we wouldn't be limited because we're patient.
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:37.740]  We could buy two ounces.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.080]  Those guys are coming 12 hours.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.160]  I'm sure they hit.
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:42.920]  They love the experience, man.
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:43.760]  Yeah, it's worth it.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:44.580]  They do.
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:46.760]  They'll hit a few shops and they'll try to hit Denver,
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:47.600]  a lot of them.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:50.560]  We have people come in.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.840]  We had a dude come in from Beijing, China.
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:53.880]  Wow.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:54.720]  International, bro.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.800]  Straight come to our dispensary.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:58.720]  Pueblo, Colorado shoppers.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:10:59.560]  Yeah.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.600]  Are from Beijing, China.
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:01.440]  That's impressive.
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:02.600]  Did he speak English?
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:03.440]  Yeah.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:04.280]  Okay.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.880]  We had a dude come from Australia.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:07.440]  Like, it was pretty intense.
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:08.980]  What did he call weed?
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:09.800]  Did he have a neat word for it?
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:10.640]  No.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:11.480]  Oh, man.
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:12.300]  He knew a lot about it though.
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:13.140]  Really?
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:13.980]  Yeah.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:15.660]  He was knowledgeable on his bud.
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:18.220]  On my website, you can see where people are looking,
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:19.620]  where people have viewed my website,
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:20.780]  what country they're in.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:23.500]  And a lot of New Zealand and Australia hits hit my website.
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:24.420]  And they look at the gallery.
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:25.260]  The gallery's down right now.
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:26.100]  I'm improving it.
[02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:27.460]  I apologize.
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:29.140]  My buddy, Wade, took a bunch of killer photos
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.540]  of some Grateful Dog and some stuff.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:31.780]  And we'll get that on the gallery for you
[02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:35.460]  on the iReed Genetics, iReedGeneticsColorado.com.
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.480]  It's the gallery's under construction.
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.360]  But a lot of those come from Australia.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.300]  A lot of the views.
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.920]  And I don't know if I should even say this,
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.960]  but there's a lot of guys,
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:49.500]  when they get out of service,
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.480]  they just, they love coming in, dude.
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.440]  No, I've worked at a dispensary as well.
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.040]  You see them kind of breathe.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.040]  And I experienced that, yeah.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:00.040]  When they start to talk about that,
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:02.000]  they're just like, I just got out of,
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:07.260]  I need something to help with PTSD or whatever.
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:09.020]  Imagine you've been around shit blowing up
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.580]  and having to watch your back for a month or three or six.
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.500]  And when you talk to them about a certain strain
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:16.060]  that might help with, for them or whatever,
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:20.220]  that's, you can see them take a deep sigh of relief.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:22.940]  It's just, that kind of shit's awesome, dude.
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:24.780]  They can put down their guard a little.
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:25.620]  Yeah.
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:26.440]  Yeah.
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.740]  My favorite is that look when,
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:30.820]  so I was the first one to shop at that dispensary,
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.920]  but then I went back later on just to go hang out.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.920]  I knew a lot of people that were there in the line and stuff.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:36.400]  I was just kind of hanging out,
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:38.920]  watching people walk out of the dispensary the first time
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.080]  with that look on their face.
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:43.520]  They look like they want to do cartwheels and shit.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:45.300]  I thought it was awesome seeing that.
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:46.180]  So you said you want to,
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:47.720]  you liked recommending strains to people.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:49.560]  I'm pointing my pen at you like I'm fucking Obama.
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.480]  You said, I can't even do it,
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:54.260]  but you said you like recommending strains to people
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:55.760]  for like PTSD.
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:57.920]  If I were a vet and I had PTSD,
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:59.360]  what would you tell me to smoke?
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:01.180]  One of the strains I'd like to pull out for them
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:02.300]  is a plush berry.
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.140]  Okay.
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:03.960]  Cause it helps them.
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:04.800]  It'll help them calm down a little bit,
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:05.860]  but still give them a little,
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:10.820]  little pep so they don't like crash out
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:11.740]  or anything like that.
[02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:14.180]  That's ironic because I thought of Jilly beans.
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:15.020]  Yeah.
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:15.860]  So shout out TGA sub cool.
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:16.680]  Yeah.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.660]  That's a plush berry is a black cherry soda
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:21.540]  time space queen and Jilly bean is orange velvet
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:23.700]  time space queen, both from TGA sub cool.
[02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:25.820]  So apparently sub cool genetics,
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:27.900]  you're good for the, the PTSD vets.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:29.880]  I recommend the cheesequake as well.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:32.240]  Ah, when we have it, it depends on what we have.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:33.080]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.080]  If you have, if you like that funky,
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:37.440]  cheesequake makes my nose wrinkle up.
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.920]  Dude, there's some people that come in
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:40.600]  and you show it to them and they're like, wow,
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.680]  that smells interesting.
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.000]  And they're kind of excited about it.
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.600]  And then there's other people that are like,
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.640]  it sounds like cheese.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:47.520]  I don't like that.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.560]  Get that away.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.120]  It's hilarious.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:53.880]  I don't like that cheesy smell.
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.240]  Everybody's got their, their particular flavors.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:57.080]  Yeah.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:58.180]  And smells that they do and don't like.
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:13:59.900]  Some people get surprised when they,
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:01.660]  they tell me what kind of a high they want
[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.300]  or what they're looking for mainly.
[02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:05.140]  And I'll pull out three or four different strains
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.140]  and they'll be like, well, what's the difference?
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:10.020]  And they'll all be similar in the high that they get,
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:11.940]  but there'll be so different in their flavor
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:12.980]  and smell profiles.
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:15.260]  I'm just like, smell them in which everyone smells
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:16.100]  the best to you.
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:16.940]  That's the one you want.
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:17.780]  Yup.
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:19.660]  And maybe that's kind of a neat idea
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:22.700]  that you just said that maybe subconsciously our nose,
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:25.020]  follow the nose and always knows, maybe,
[02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:26.500]  maybe your body is like that one right there.
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.080]  There's got the stuff you need because you know,
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:30.760]  we'd like the sour diesel a lot
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:32.680]  and it works medicinally very well.
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.520]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:34.360]  That's your thing.
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:36.240]  I can't, that's not a medicinal plant for me.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:39.720]  It does, it does help with a lot of people's ailments.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:40.560]  Yeah.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.400]  But I do love the OG Kush's and those are good for my,
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:46.640]  that's, when I smoke sour diesel,
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:51.480]  I always describe it as my ADD turns into a cartoon
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:52.520]  and just starts spinning.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:55.320]  Like the circus comes on when I smoke too much sour D.
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.780]  I just get like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:02.340]  It's like, yeah, it's like I'm in a cartoon slash movie
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:03.980]  and it's just going faster than it should.
[02:15:03.980 --> 02:15:06.020]  And I can't, I start nine projects
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:07.180]  and leave them all sitting there
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:08.900]  and don't finish any of them.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.820]  That's sour diesel for me.
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:12.300]  It's cool, I don't mind it sometimes,
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:14.780]  but it can make a mess of you.
[02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:17.900]  Always goes right to my head, man.
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:20.660]  That's my Chong joke, my Cheech and Chong reference.
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:21.740]  All right.
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.560]  So usually I do a part of the show
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.040]  where we give thanks to somebody,
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:28.800]  but I read something on the internet
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:31.880]  that I thought we should laugh at.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.800]  And I want to call this the dip shit of the week.
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:39.480]  You guys got to find this woman.
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:40.300]  So the headline says,
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:43.720]  woman calls police, complains about bad weed.
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:46.400]  Woman tells police drug dealer won't give her refund
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:48.920]  by Michael Wesp.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:51.400]  Right on Michael for having a normal fucking name.
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.560]  Oh, guess where these people are from?
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:58.760]  Lufkin, Texas.
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:01.400]  Oh, they're from Lufkin, Texas.
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:02.920]  Lufkin, Texas.
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:03.760]  Nice.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:06.480]  So we should have just wrote up with someone
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:08.800]  that got some Colorado weed.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:11.800]  We need a refund.
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.280]  Did you just hear a weird thump?
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:14.600]  Someone kicking down the front door?
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:15.900]  I hope we're cool in here.
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:18.800]  Then we just go silent for a minute.
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:20.800]  We're cool guys, nobody's barging in.
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:21.620]  I don't know what that's,
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:23.300]  it's from the wind, it's cool.
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:24.640]  It's that, it's windy here in Colorado tonight.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.540]  It's been windy for a couple of days.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.200]  It's getting to be nice.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.600]  Cold is shifting and it's getting to the warm.
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:32.440]  Yep.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:34.400]  Yoga pants season in Denver.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.360]  Beginning to get to where it sucks to be inside
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:38.200]  when you're working.
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:40.080]  Oh yeah, you got to come out.
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:41.120]  Get some sunshine of your own,
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.880]  get out from under the grow lights.
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.560]  All right, let's get back to our celebrity sighting
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.120]  in Lufkin, Texas.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.960]  A Texas woman found herself behind bars Thursday
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:53.140]  after calling Lufkin, Texas authorities
[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:55.220]  to complain about bad weed.
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:56.540]  I'm going to read that again.
[02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:59.100]  A Texas woman found herself behind bars Thursday
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:01.140]  after calling Lufkin, Texas authorities
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:02.780]  to complain about bad weed.
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:05.860]  Is that quality control?
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.060]  I'll call the police.
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.820]  So the Lufkin Police Department received a call for help
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:14.020]  from the 200 block of Forest Block Boulevard around 7 p.m.
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:17.900]  The caller, Evelyn Louise Hamilton, 37 of Lufkin,
[02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:20.600]  complained to dispatchers about a bad batch of drugs
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:23.140]  that her dealer would not refund.
[02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:25.540]  I don't think Texas has an MED.
[02:17:25.540 --> 02:17:28.900]  No, they definitely don't have a sense of humor either.
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:31.860]  So responding officers asked Hamilton
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:33.260]  if she had any marijuana on her.
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:34.620]  She admitted to having some pot
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:37.180]  and turned over a small baggie hidden in her bra.
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:39.140]  She was then arrested for possession of marijuana.
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:41.500]  Her bail was set at $500.
[02:17:44.370 --> 02:17:46.890]  At least they didn't string her up by her tits or nothing.
[02:17:46.890 --> 02:17:51.410]  So Evelyn Louise Hamilton of Lufkin, Texas,
[02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:52.990]  you're my dipshit of the week
[02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:54.990]  and you're my first dipshit.
[02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:56.830]  Usually I honor someone who is cool
[02:17:56.830 --> 02:18:00.550]  and I just wanna say, don't do that kind of shit, dude.
[02:18:02.430 --> 02:18:04.550]  I don't think any of our listeners need any explanation
[02:18:04.550 --> 02:18:06.570]  on why not to do that.
[02:18:06.570 --> 02:18:09.230]  Don't call the police about bad weed.
[02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:10.270]  That's not cool.
[02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:11.430]  All right.
[02:18:11.430 --> 02:18:13.750]  You wanna take another dab and then wrap this show up?
[02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:14.910]  Let's do that.
[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:15.950]  Let's do that.
[02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:17.790]  I didn't even say that into my microphone.
[02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:18.710]  I heard you in the headphones,
[02:18:18.710 --> 02:18:20.230]  so I think we got you a little bit at least.
[02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:23.010]  You said, let's do that, all enthusiastic like.
[02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:23.850]  I did.
[02:18:23.850 --> 02:18:24.670]  Is there anything you wanna talk about
[02:18:24.670 --> 02:18:26.210]  while I get a couple of dabs on the dabber?
[02:18:26.210 --> 02:18:27.650]  I don't know.
[02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:28.890]  I'll probably think of something.
[02:18:28.890 --> 02:18:29.850]  Well, think quickly,
[02:18:29.850 --> 02:18:31.730]  because now's your time, dude.
[02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:34.370]  You're getting stuff on the dabber right now.
[02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:35.290]  Well, I'll just talk about
[02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:36.690]  you're getting stuff on the dabber.
[02:18:36.690 --> 02:18:37.530]  All right.
[02:18:37.530 --> 02:18:38.370]  Do you want me to how?
[02:18:38.370 --> 02:18:39.210]  What?
[02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:40.030]  Huh?
[02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:41.370]  Do you want me to sing one of these monster dabs
[02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:42.690]  that I'm known for on the show?
[02:18:42.690 --> 02:18:43.530]  I haven't done that yet
[02:18:43.530 --> 02:18:44.970]  because it usually fucks me up so good.
[02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:45.810]  I'd do it.
[02:18:45.810 --> 02:18:46.630]  And then also think about-
[02:18:46.630 --> 02:18:47.470]  I'll take one too.
[02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:48.310]  I don't care.
[02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:50.050]  What do you wanna hear as a closing song?
[02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:51.710]  Oh, geez.
[02:18:51.710 --> 02:18:53.750]  You're just putting it on the spot.
[02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:55.310]  A hundred dollar bag.
[02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:56.150]  Oh, dude.
[02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.970]  Is what I wanna hear.
[02:18:56.970 --> 02:18:58.070]  That's fucking epic.
[02:18:59.430 --> 02:19:01.070]  Shout out to Mystic Roots Band.
[02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:04.590]  Yes.
[02:19:04.590 --> 02:19:06.030]  Closing song will be called a hundred dollar bag.
[02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:09.590]  It's actually not originally written by Mystic Roots.
[02:19:09.590 --> 02:19:11.270]  I'll send a sticker,
[02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:12.950]  two iRegenetic stickers
[02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:16.070]  to the first person that tweets me
[02:19:16.970 --> 02:19:19.970]  the name of the artist that originally recorded the song
[02:19:19.970 --> 02:19:21.290]  hundred dollar bag.
[02:19:21.290 --> 02:19:23.610]  You got to tweet me at iGrowCulture
[02:19:23.610 --> 02:19:25.090]  and say, send me two stickers
[02:19:25.090 --> 02:19:28.890]  because the artist is and fill in the blank.
[02:19:28.890 --> 02:19:30.810]  And I'll send you two iRegenetic stickers.
[02:19:30.810 --> 02:19:31.930]  You'll have to, I'll contact you
[02:19:31.930 --> 02:19:34.490]  and you can send me your mailing info.
[02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:37.250]  Check that out.
[02:19:37.250 --> 02:19:39.330]  Some interaction with the peoples, bro.
[02:19:39.330 --> 02:19:40.170]  That's pretty tight.
[02:19:40.170 --> 02:19:41.010]  I like the people that listen.
[02:19:41.010 --> 02:19:42.170]  Episode number five.
[02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:44.890]  So, Kev just took a drink and he's like,
[02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:46.790]  so Kev just took a drink and tried to speak.
[02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:49.710]  And I think you sounded like Ray Romano a little bit.
[02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:52.430]  He's a little bit of Kermit the Romano.
[02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.910]  I'm gonna have to get that down really well
[02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:56.810]  so that way I can get super famous doing just speaking.
[02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:59.750]  If you guys just heard some weird gurgling sounds
[02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:01.470]  on the mic, I don't know if that came through.
[02:20:01.470 --> 02:20:02.710]  That's our friend Barney.
[02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:05.670]  That's our friend Barney.
[02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:10.550]  Kevin's got some really active sounding intestines.
[02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:12.950]  We won't elaborate too much on Kevin's conditions.
[02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:13.790]  Not my fault.
[02:20:14.490 --> 02:20:16.090]  He's had some rerouting inside of him
[02:20:16.090 --> 02:20:17.670]  from some childhood things,
[02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:21.130]  but sometimes he sounds like a freaking drainage system.
[02:20:21.130 --> 02:20:22.450]  It still works.
[02:20:22.450 --> 02:20:25.530]  It hasn't started leaking yet either, so.
[02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:28.210]  We're good so far.
[02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:32.250]  It sounds like you're draining like gallons of stuff
[02:20:32.250 --> 02:20:33.730]  out through your body sometimes.
[02:20:33.730 --> 02:20:34.850]  It's really funny.
[02:20:34.850 --> 02:20:36.490]  And new people, when new people are around
[02:20:36.490 --> 02:20:38.570]  and it happens, they get worried about you.
[02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:40.610]  They look at you like, what, did you just shit
[02:20:40.610 --> 02:20:42.850]  all over that couch or what, dude?
[02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:44.310]  No, that was Barney.
[02:20:44.310 --> 02:20:46.030]  That was Barney, we named it.
[02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.870]  We named it.
[02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:49.670]  How did it get the name Barney, do you remember?
[02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:51.990]  I just watched the show too much.
[02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:54.350]  Okay, the show being How I Met Your Mother.
[02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:58.950]  I just watched the show a lot
[02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:03.250]  and that's my favorite character on the show is NPH.
[02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:05.710]  Fucking Barney.
[02:21:07.350 --> 02:21:09.190]  You gave him the NPH.
[02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:10.110]  Hell yeah, dude.
[02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:12.230]  NPH, we're gonna take dabs at separate times
[02:21:12.570 --> 02:21:14.810]  so that one of us could be talking this time.
[02:21:14.810 --> 02:21:16.730]  That's a pretty, would you call that a man dab?
[02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:18.090]  That's a dude dab.
[02:21:18.090 --> 02:21:19.290]  That's a dude dab.
[02:21:19.290 --> 02:21:20.570]  Dude dab.
[02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:22.410]  I'm gonna hurt myself here on the show with you guys
[02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:23.850]  just to enjoy it.
[02:21:23.850 --> 02:21:24.690]  Oh, crap.
[02:21:24.690 --> 02:21:27.410]  He's gonna, yeah, this is gonna be interesting.
[02:21:27.410 --> 02:21:29.730]  He's got two gigantic dabs over there.
[02:21:29.730 --> 02:21:30.810]  You gonna do both of them?
[02:21:30.810 --> 02:21:32.250]  No, the other one's for you.
[02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:33.170]  Oh, cool.
[02:21:34.170 --> 02:21:35.650]  Okay.
[02:21:35.650 --> 02:21:37.970]  Unless somebody wants to ninja dab me.
[02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:42.010]  I gotta sit here in front of this microphone and talk.
[02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:43.830]  I'm gonna just use that as an excuse.
[02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:46.230]  Have we talked about a sniper dab or a time bomb?
[02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:48.950]  Have we talked about that?
[02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:52.310]  Teach people about a sniper bomb or a sniper dab.
[02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:55.470]  That sniper dab, when you put the dab
[02:21:55.470 --> 02:21:59.430]  on the bottom of the carb cap.
[02:21:59.430 --> 02:22:03.390]  So when people carb cap their shit,
[02:22:03.390 --> 02:22:06.590]  they get another dab all surprise like,
[02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:09.030]  because no one looks under the fucking carb cap
[02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:10.110]  before you do a dab.
[02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:12.610]  You just do the dab and put your carb cap on
[02:22:12.610 --> 02:22:15.330]  and that's how it works.
[02:22:15.330 --> 02:22:16.170]  So if you're listening.
[02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:17.050]  Beware.
[02:22:17.050 --> 02:22:18.530]  If you're listening here, I'll pass this over to you
[02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:19.470]  and I'll ramble for a minute.
[02:22:19.470 --> 02:22:21.450]  Now here's a little dab, here's a dabby dab.
[02:22:21.450 --> 02:22:22.290]  Boom, there's a dab.
[02:22:22.290 --> 02:22:23.570]  There's a torch.
[02:22:23.570 --> 02:22:25.730]  There's a lot of accessories involved
[02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:28.090]  in taking a nice quality dab.
[02:22:28.090 --> 02:22:28.930]  That's okay.
[02:22:28.930 --> 02:22:29.770]  I love the process.
[02:22:29.770 --> 02:22:30.770]  It actually, I enjoy it.
[02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:33.750]  Yeah, it's very, very interesting.
[02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:36.490]  There we go.
[02:22:36.490 --> 02:22:38.530]  I'm just gonna cough and cough and cough.
[02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:41.470]  I was supposed to say something while you took a dab
[02:22:41.470 --> 02:22:43.270]  and I totally don't remember what, so.
[02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:44.110]  Nice.
[02:22:44.110 --> 02:22:48.470]  I'm gonna remind everybody to check out my Facebook.
[02:22:48.470 --> 02:22:50.550]  Look at the I Grow Culture Facebook.
[02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:53.430]  I Grow Culture has an Instagram and a Twitter.
[02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:57.070]  Look at I Regenetics on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter.
[02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:59.670]  Shout out to our dipshit of the week again.
[02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:00.830]  That was funny in my opinion.
[02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:02.870]  I hope you guys liked that as much as I did.
[02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:04.510]  If you've got somebody that you'd like me to honor
[02:23:04.510 --> 02:23:06.830]  in either way, a positive or a negative way,
[02:23:06.850 --> 02:23:09.010]  I'll call someone a dipshit on there.
[02:23:09.010 --> 02:23:10.530]  I'm cool with that.
[02:23:10.530 --> 02:23:13.010]  But if you think that we should say thanks to them,
[02:23:13.010 --> 02:23:14.710]  also let me know.
[02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:16.170]  So since I don't remember what that one thing
[02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:19.490]  I was gonna say was, we're just gonna let Kev
[02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.490]  choke into the mic for a second.
[02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:22.330]  Me too, excuse me.
[02:23:22.330 --> 02:23:23.730]  Sorry, that was fucking rude.
[02:23:23.730 --> 02:23:25.970]  And then we're gonna play $100 Bag
[02:23:25.970 --> 02:23:27.210]  from the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:23:27.210 --> 02:23:28.410]  Hey, I thank everybody for joining me.
[02:23:28.410 --> 02:23:30.290]  Sorry, I'm really dabbed out right at the end of the show.
[02:23:30.290 --> 02:23:32.330]  Try not to cough too much on you.
[02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:33.570]  Oh, right on.
[02:23:34.530 --> 02:23:35.370]  That was fun.
[02:23:35.370 --> 02:23:36.690]  Anything else?
[02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:40.630]  Thanks for having me on again for the fifth episode.
[02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:41.470]  That's fucking killer.
[02:23:41.470 --> 02:23:43.230]  I think that's V, isn't V5?
[02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:46.210]  Yep, hit up iRegenetics, don't forget.
[02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:48.510]  All right. Keep listening.
[02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:50.190]  We're gonna cough with you for a minute
[02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:51.330]  and listen to part of this song.
[02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:53.550]  So have a great afternoon, boys and girls.
[02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:55.510]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:56.350]  Peace.
[02:24:31.470 --> 02:24:32.750]  She was living in a single room
[02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:34.390]  with three other individuals.
[02:24:34.390 --> 02:24:36.590]  One of them was a male and the other two,
[02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:38.430]  the other two were females.
[02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:40.730]  God only knows what they were up to in there.
[02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:42.770]  And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit
[02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:44.530]  surprised to learn that all four of them
[02:24:44.530 --> 02:24:46.990]  habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes.
[02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:49.270]  Briefers.
[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:17.540]  Man.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:18.900]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:20.620]  Happy 420 weekend.
[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:23.180]  Welcome to Agriculture Podcast.
[02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:25.180]  This is episode number six.
[02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:27.660]  Everyone's so dabbed out already at this table.
[02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:28.500]  We can't talk.
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:30.780]  We can't catch our breath.
[02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:32.980]  Welcome, welcome.
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:34.960]  I hope you guys are having as good of a 420 week
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:36.320]  as we are over here.
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:38.320]  My eyes are watering from the dab I just took.
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:39.280]  My throat hurts.
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:40.240]  Me too.
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:42.880]  I'm gonna take a sip of this drink right here real fast.
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:45.680]  Gotta give credit to the intro song.
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:48.080]  You're listening to Smoke Dude Joints by Sublime.
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:50.340]  Gotta give credit.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:54.280]  All right.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:55.920]  Oh man.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:00.960]  Just so dabbed out, he's sneezing over there.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:02.440]  That's nice.
[02:26:02.780 --> 02:26:05.060]  All right, let's kill the music and get down to business.
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:05.980]  Let's do this.
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:07.260]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:08.620]  I'm gonna try it one official time
[02:26:08.620 --> 02:26:10.340]  without music in the background.
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:12.300]  Think my head's glued back on.
[02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:15.220]  Welcome to episode number six of the Agriculture Podcast.
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:16.260]  That feels better.
[02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:18.740]  Woo, the 420 episode.
[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:20.300]  Happy 420 weekend, everybody.
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:21.340]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:22.660]  We're sitting here with my buddy, Adam.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:25.940]  We got Kevin from Elevated Concentrations across the table.
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:26.780]  Yo, yo.
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:29.500]  We're so dabbed out.
[02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.180]  I heard somebody yesterday, I gave him a dab,
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:34.840]  and he said, my head feels like I'm inside of a tin can.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:36.880]  And I think the dab I just took,
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:38.440]  I know how that poor dude feels.
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.000]  Wow.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.520]  I'm glad you guys are here.

[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:21.580]  Everybody at the table's got this weird look on their face
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:23.820]  like, holy crap, we're dabbed out, bro.
[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:26.300]  I'm staring at the floor like, please breathe.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.120]  Please breathe.
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:28.020]  You're telling the floor to breathe?
[02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:29.640]  Yeah, just breathe, please.
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.360]  So I hope you guys are having a good 420.

[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:38.320]  or from the Cannabis Cup and checking us out.
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:39.520]  We're hitting some of the events.
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.440]  There's all kinds of stuff, geez.
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:42.520]  Yeah, if you're not in Colorado,
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:43.760]  I hope you're finding something cool to do
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:45.400]  to celebrate 420.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:49.000]  Pretty much most every major person in the cannabis culture
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  from like the 16th on through the 20th
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.360]  is gonna be in Denver.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:55.200]  In Denver.
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.120]  People are landing already.
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:27:57.960]  People are here.
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:27:59.540]  I'm seeing it on Facebook and whatnot.
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:00.900]  We're in Denver, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:01.740]  Welcome.
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:05.100]  There will be a lot of footage of epicness.
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:05.940]  Epicness.
[02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:07.700]  Happenings.
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:11.300]  See, this is what happens on the I Grow Culture podcast.
[02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:14.740]  Man, we are dabbing it up over here.
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:16.460]  Dab Slur 5000.
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:19.900]  Yeah, I feel like I maybe should've wiped my nose
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:20.860]  before we started this
[02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:22.700]  because now I feel like I'm just full of them.
[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:24.940]  Full of snots, bro, the dabs get you running.
[02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:26.700]  That happens to some people.
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.040]  That happens.
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.660]  So it's 420 weekend.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.520]  Do you guys know where,
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.560]  where do you think the 420 name came from?
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:38.080]  I've heard that it came from students in Harvard or Yale
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:39.520]  where they would go,
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:41.600]  that would be the time that they would get out of school
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:43.560]  and they would go and smoke.
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.080]  And it just affiliated from there.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:48.360]  I mean, besides being like the almighty,
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:49.720]  everybody knows Hitler's birthday.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:50.800]  I mean.
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:53.800]  I heard in like the early seventies at a high school,
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:55.760]  like four kids.
[02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:57.260]  I forget the name of the high school.
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:28:58.380]  Okay.
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:01.420]  Four kids would meet up and that was, yeah,
[02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:04.060]  they would smoke and that was just kind of their time.
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:04.900]  All right.
[02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:05.740]  Well, I'm the host.
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:07.300]  I did some research.
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.900]  Those teenagers were actually from San Rafael, California
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:11.680]  and they call themselves the Waldos.
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:12.540]  Yep.
[02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:13.380]  And.
[02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:15.260]  That rings a bell now.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:17.340]  Yeah, they hung out near a statue,
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:20.160]  the Louis Pasteur statue
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:21.900]  on the grounds of San Rafael High School
[02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:23.260]  as their meeting place.
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:25.180]  And 420 was their meeting time.
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:28.960]  So that's where these dudes coined the 420.
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:30.160]  I was misinformed then.
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:31.000]  That's all right.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:31.920]  That's part of what we're here for.
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:33.200]  We're here to inform.
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.000]  Didn't it kind of spread through the Grateful Dead
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.200]  and stuff after that?
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.920]  A lot of that stuff is true, yes.
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:39.320]  That's where a lot of it spread through
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:41.400]  as the Dead Tour, Fish Tour.
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:43.840]  The Wookiee kids were spreading that.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:46.200]  So I was trying to explain the Wookiee kids
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:47.560]  to Christy the other day.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:52.200]  And I don't know if I was able to do it well enough.
[02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:54.040]  You just got to take her to a fish.
[02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:55.980]  I've never been to a fish store myself.
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:57.020]  Look, look.
[02:29:57.020 --> 02:29:57.860]  Yeah.
[02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:01.140]  I represent that crowd so I can talk shit about the Wookiee.
[02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:03.820]  I was trying to tell her that that's basically what Jeff is,
[02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:05.300]  but she didn't understand.
[02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:06.140]  Yeah.
[02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:10.340]  So we do that segment called Give Thanks Every Show.
[02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:13.020]  One time we did a shithead, which I thought was cool.
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:14.980]  But we did the Give Thanks.
[02:30:14.980 --> 02:30:16.540]  And this time we're gonna give thanks to the Waldos
[02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.620]  because those guys coined something
[02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:19.700]  that has lasted forever.
[02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:22.260]  It's become integral to the scene.
[02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:24.360]  You see 420 friendly when you're trying to rent out
[02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:26.720]  an apartment or if you're trying to go somewhere.
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:28.740]  420 friendly is a common phrase.
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:31.760]  We're having the cannabis cup on 420.
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:32.920]  Like that's how big this shit got.
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.200]  It's a neutral phrase.
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:35.040]  Yeah.
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:38.760]  That I feel like even if you're not in the community,
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:40.080]  you can use.
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:40.920]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:41.760]  Even if you're a smoker.
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.580]  That makes sense.
[02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:43.420]  No 420.
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:44.920]  That'd just be a nice simple sign, you know?
[02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:45.760]  Yep.
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:47.160]  Which I wouldn't go there, but.
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:47.980]  All right.
[02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:48.820]  Do you guys know who made up 710
[02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:50.440]  just since we're on that rant?
[02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:52.140]  I don't know who exactly.
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:54.040]  I know.
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:54.860]  I know who it was, bro.
[02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:55.700]  I'm not gonna say it on the air.
[02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:57.280]  How about if you guys are listening right now,
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:00.080]  shoot me a tweet at, at I grow culture.
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:02.360]  And the first person to correctly answer,
[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:05.240]  I think it was during a conference call
[02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:07.400]  with two popular entities.
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:08.240]  Yeah.
[02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:09.560]  And if, yeah.
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:11.560]  So if they text me the two that I'm thinking,
[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:12.880]  or if they tweet me the two that I'm thinking,
[02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:15.920]  I'll send you a couple of iRegenetic stickers
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.880]  or the iHeartDab sticker in there.
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:19.200]  So remind me and tweet me about that.
[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:21.320]  This is the second sticker contest I've done.
[02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:23.660]  So somebody get that going.
[02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:24.500]  Oh, stickers.
[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:25.320]  Great.
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:26.980]  I love, yeah, you got a sticker up all your shit.
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:27.820]  Mm-hmm.
[02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:29.620]  I got one on my computer at the house.
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:31.260]  You got an iRegenetic sticker on the computer?
[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:32.740]  That one you gave me the night at the shop.
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:33.860]  Nice.
[02:31:33.860 --> 02:31:35.060]  Very cool.
[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:36.420]  Very, very cool.
[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:38.260]  Got a weird random topic.
[02:31:38.260 --> 02:31:40.420]  Who knows about sriracha sauce?
[02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:41.240]  What?
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:42.080]  Rooster sauce, bro.
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:43.300]  That fucking, oh yeah.
[02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:44.780]  You don't eat the spicy stuff.
[02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:46.740]  I eat spicy stuff, but I don't, I mean,
[02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:48.940]  I stick to like a, I don't know how to say it
[02:31:48.940 --> 02:31:50.380]  because both of you were just giving me shit
[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:52.480]  about how I say Pueblo.
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:54.760]  So here we go.
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:55.660]  Tapito?
[02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:56.500]  Okay.
[02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:57.320]  Tapatio.
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:58.160]  Tapatio.
[02:31:58.160 --> 02:31:59.000]  There you go.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:31:59.820]  See, I fucked that up too.
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.660]  Come on, where's Wade when we need him?
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:03.760]  Sriracha is that lovely, delicious red hot sauce
[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:05.320]  that all of us hippies like to put on
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:07.240]  fucking almost everything we eat.
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:08.080]  I've heard of it.
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:08.900]  I've just never ate.
[02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:12.180]  The sriracha factory in Irwindale, California
[02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:14.560]  has been recently declared a public nuisance
[02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:16.720]  by Irwindale City Council.
[02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:17.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:19.840]  I think it's funny because it relates to the Denver topic
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:22.520]  when people were complaining about weed smells.
[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:25.060]  The pungent pepper fumes burn locals' eyes and throat
[02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:26.820]  and cause respiratory issues.
[02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:28.980]  Hoi Fong Foods opened the plant two years ago
[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:31.100]  and they've been working to minimize odors.
[02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:33.980]  They need some carbon filters or some shit.
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:36.140]  They now have 90 days to correct the issue.
[02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:38.240]  This could lead to a shortage
[02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:40.380]  of my favorite rooster sauce, bro.
[02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:42.460]  We can't let this happen, man.
[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:43.300]  That sucks.
[02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:44.120]  I thought that was an interesting topic.
[02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:44.960]  So what are we gonna do about it?
[02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:45.800]  There's nothing we can,
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:46.740]  Hoi Fong has to get their shit together
[02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:48.340]  and make it not stink so badly.
[02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:51.260]  So they have to not let it happen.
[02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:52.100]  Yeah.
[02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:52.920]  Why don't you write them
[02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:54.080]  and recommend them a good carbon filter?
[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:56.160]  Oh, it's gonna take some industrial strength shit.
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.400]  They claim they have it under control,
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:32:58.520]  but I thought that was interesting
[02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:00.600]  that the neighbors are complaining.
[02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:01.920]  They feel like they're getting tear gassed
[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:03.120]  all day over there.
[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:03.960]  That's gotta suck.
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:05.040]  That's fucked.
[02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:06.160]  That's fucked.
[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:08.480]  I would want a discount on my fucking rent.
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.940]  Well, your landlord didn't do it.
[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:13.760]  So that's probably part of the problem
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:14.600]  because people are going,
[02:33:14.600 --> 02:33:16.200]  hey, hey.
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:18.160]  Was it really that big of a problem in Denver
[02:33:18.980 --> 02:33:21.340]  when it first started that it was that apparent?
[02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:22.900]  Like you couldn't go downtown anywhere
[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:23.940]  without smelling pot?
[02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:25.180]  There were certain neighborhoods,
[02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:27.260]  like there's a little commercial area.
[02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:28.980]  It's like a commercial industrial area.
[02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:30.420]  Where it was cheap.
[02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:31.580]  That's where all the warehouses are.
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:32.420]  Oh.
[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:33.460]  And it just stinks, bro.
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:34.820]  Like you can, I could smell it.
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:37.340]  And I don't even notice the smell of weed in some places.
[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:38.820]  When I walk into dispensaries
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:39.660]  and other people go,
[02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:41.540]  oh, it smells so good in here.
[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:42.780]  I'll be like, real, what does it smell like?
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:43.620]  Describe it.
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:44.660]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:46.020]  I'm immune, I guess.
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.120]  All right.
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:50.080]  So nobody was interested in the sriracha story
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:50.920]  at the table here.
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:53.360]  Maybe this will get somebody's attention.
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:56.800]  Hey, I'm sorry that your hot sauce story didn't.
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:58.080]  Dude, I'm crushed inside.
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:33:58.920]  Tingle my toes.
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:01.400]  I use that hot sauce a lot.
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:03.320]  So there was recently,
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:04.160]  you guys got to pay attention.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:05.560]  Here's the important part of the show.
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:06.400]  Uh oh.
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:07.640]  Your microphone's gonna fall out of the stand, bro.
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:08.480]  You might want to adjust it
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:09.560]  in the little clippy thing there.
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:10.400]  Fine.
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:11.220]  You're cool.
[02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:12.320]  I don't do that.
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:13.920]  You should see how dabbed he looked
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:15.480]  trying to fix that shit.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:16.660]  It's adjusted.
[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:18.860]  You'll just hold it with his eye again in a minute.
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:22.140]  There was a Senate bill has just been introduced.
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:24.180]  It is Senate Bill 177.
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:29.060]  Senate Bill 14-177, Colorado Senate Bill.
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:34.060]  This thing is called the drug endangered child
[02:34:34.700 --> 02:34:37.540]  for the purposes of cases of child abuse
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:39.960]  or neglect in the Children's Code.
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:43.500]  What they're trying to do,
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:45.000]  what they're attempting to do
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:48.000]  is they want to,
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.320]  there are no rules in place.
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:50.680]  If they come into your house
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:52.040]  and you're doing drugs in the house
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:52.880]  and there's a child there,
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:55.440]  there aren't really set rules on that.
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.720]  That there are vague rules and things,
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:59.600]  but they're trying to make it,
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:02.960]  they're trying to put like definitely a street code,
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.440]  some rules.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.280]  I'll read from it.
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.400]  It'll make more sense.
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:07.480]  When controlled substances,
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.700]  whether legal or illegal,
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:09.540]  are used, produced,
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:11.920]  or distributed in the presence of children,
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:13.500]  a greater likelihood exists for harm
[02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:16.340]  to the children from caretaker incapacitation,
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:18.500]  access to dangerous drug production components,
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:19.540]  lack of supervision,
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:21.100]  unhealthy and or error quality,
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:24.920]  exposure to dangerous non-drug criminal behaviors,
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:28.620]  and other circumstances that pose a danger to children.
[02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:29.980]  Law enforcement agencies,
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:30.980]  human services,
[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:31.800]  family courts,
[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:32.980]  and the criminal justice system
[02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:34.900]  currently do not have a common definition
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:36.260]  of a drug endangered child.
[02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:37.540]  That's what I was trying to stumble into,
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:40.060]  but dabs are fucking making it clogged.
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:42.120]  Law enforcement agencies have human services
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:44.040]  and statutory mandated reporters
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:47.580]  of suspected child maltreatment need common tools
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:48.480]  and training.
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:50.280]  Wow, I fucked all that up trying to say it,
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:52.560]  but these guys need common tools and training
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:54.920]  to identify a child at risk of abuse
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:35:56.880]  and neglect as a result of the use,
[02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:59.120]  production, and distribution of drugs
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.960]  in a child's environment.
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:02.320]  Now this goes on and on and on and on,
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:03.240]  and there are a few things
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:06.120]  that kind of pissed off a lot of people in Colorado.
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:08.520]  Got some feathers ruffled here.
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:11.580]  Drug endangered child means any child in a case
[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:13.940]  in which any of the following situations occur.
[02:36:13.940 --> 02:36:16.420]  The presence of a child,
[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:19.920]  or on the premises where a child is found or resides,
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:24.180]  a controlled substance is defined in section 1818-102.
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:25.020]  There's a lot of stuff here
[02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:26.300]  that's gonna sound ridiculous to you guys,
[02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:28.420]  but there are three words here,
[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:32.220]  manufactured, distributed, cultivated.
[02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:34.580]  Cultivated is aiming at us.
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:35.420]  At growing.
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:37.320]  At growing, at marijuana users.
[02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:40.900]  And there are also other things in this, in the language,
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:44.060]  that will come back to bite cannabis users,
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:46.700]  medical marijuana patients, growers, smokers.
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:48.060]  This will come to bite us in our ass.
[02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.960]  First of all, because,
[02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:52.740]  can I mention that you've got kids
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:53.580]  and that you're a pot smoker?
[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:54.420]  Yeah, absolutely, no.
[02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:56.000]  Because that's kind of why I brought you on this episode.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.360]  When I said this, you got pissed because,
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.200]  well, tell them why, I'll let you go for it.
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:04.200]  I just moved here from a non, I guess.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:06.020]  A non-friendly state?
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:07.560]  Non-cannabis friendly.
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:09.000]  It was illegal as fuck where you were.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.360]  I mean, anything pretty much east of the Mississippi,
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:14.380]  unless you're north in Michigan and things like that, DC.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:17.160]  It's not even relevant.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:18.040]  Like there's no shops.
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:20.000]  You know, a lot of the states, even Florida,
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.440]  where I'm from, is starting to look towards medicalization,
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:24.980]  but it's still gonna take three years
[02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:27.180]  to pass all the bullshit gray lines
[02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:29.080]  and to even place it into law.
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:31.280]  So before it gets rolling around,
[02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:33.260]  I mean, when I left there,
[02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:35.600]  they were still writing laws saying,
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:38.100]  if you had more than three sprouted seeds,
[02:37:38.100 --> 02:37:42.020]  then your ass is going to jail for cultivation.
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.140]  But that's not it.
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:45.740]  It's more along the lines of,
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:47.500]  yeah, the dabs are really making this hard now.
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:48.340]  No, it's all right.
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:49.160]  It's all right.
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:50.020]  Everyone else is dabbed out listening too.
[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:52.700]  So you came here to Colorado to get away from
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.740]  going to prison for having three sprouted seeds
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:56.480]  and having a little bit of cannabis freedom.
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:58.720]  It's absolutely having cannabis freedom.
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:00.540]  Having the ability to come here
[02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:03.740]  and as a legal adult who follows the laws,
[02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:05.180]  I should be able to grow my six plants.
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:06.600]  Now they're saying if I follow the laws,
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:07.880]  then I'll have no problem.
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:11.260]  But they're also saying that if I'm using marijuana.
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:14.200]  It says cultivated.
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:16.120]  If you're cultivating marijuana in your backyard
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:17.040]  and your child lives there,
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:19.420]  you've got a drug endangered child.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.520]  You know, that's hard because I just moved here
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:26.400]  and got my med card and they said that you were cool.
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:29.040]  Not only that, but by Colorado state law, I'm cool.
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:32.400]  And now you said earlier that this is strictly a Colorado.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:33.240]  This is a Colorado bill, yes.
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:34.560]  This is a Colorado bill.
[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:36.140]  So this isn't anywhere else.
[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:39.420]  I just moved here to get away from the stimula.
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:42.260]  I mean, I've had issues where me and her
[02:38:42.260 --> 02:38:45.660]  have had arguments and then DCF is in our life,
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:47.420]  just like they have to be.
[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:49.540]  They step in for 45 days or however long,
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:50.900]  they give us a piss test.
[02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:52.700]  They make sure they come by a couple of times.
[02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:54.920]  They ask the kids, they see this, you know,
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:55.940]  everything's good.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:57.820]  We've had no problems beyond that.
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:01.480]  But what it's been always is if you can pee in this cup
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:03.580]  and the line isn't there.
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:04.600]  It's always what it's been.
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:07.360]  And if the line's there, then we're gonna have a problem.
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:09.240]  And now they're saying that, oh no,
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:10.440]  go ahead and move out there.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:13.160]  And I packed my family up and moved 1200 miles
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.280]  to come out here.
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.760]  And then now you're, you know, three months into it,
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:18.680]  it's, they're gonna pass a law and say,
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:21.880]  and I can't cultivate, you know,
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:24.700]  six plants in the backyard where I follow everything
[02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:26.440]  state law wide.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:28.840]  You know, I don't have the plants in the backyard right now,
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:32.200]  but I moved here in the promise of that's what I'm doing
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:33.040]  this year.
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:36.200]  That's so there was an amendment to this bill.
[02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:39.900]  It says, and I'm gonna skip some of the technical part
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:41.220]  just because it bores our listeners
[02:39:41.220 --> 02:39:42.320]  and it makes me stumble.
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.660]  Nothing in this part four shall prohibit the use,
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:46.460]  possession, cultivation, distribution,
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:48.320]  or manufacture of a controlled substance
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:50.380]  that is permitted by Colorado law.
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:52.820]  And that is used, possessed, cultivated, distributed,
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:55.620]  or manufactured in accordance with Colorado law
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:39:58.740]  in a situation that does not pose a threat of injury
[02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:00.620]  to a child's life or health.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:05.280]  So they are vaguely trying to help us out,
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:07.320]  but the-
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:09.640]  Why do I still feel like this is pointed towards smokers?
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.040]  Well, the legal, the guy that guides me
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:14.080]  with my little bit of my legal ideas,
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.000]  the guy that got me onto this here to want to talk about it,
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.080]  he says, that's not enough.
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:20.080]  He says, it's still the way that it's worded.
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:21.840]  We are still gonna get boned in the butt
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.680]  is essentially what he's saying.
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:24.060]  What about prescription pills?
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:25.600]  What about alcohol?
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:27.400]  And I mean, I understand those are regulated
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.560]  a little bit differently, but he's more taught,
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:32.220]  this is more aimed at like meth labs and weed grows
[02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:33.500]  and that sort of thing,
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:34.580]  because the things you're aiming for
[02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:36.140]  are regulated by other entities.
[02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:38.020]  I'm all down with, you know,
[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:40.740]  tackling down on the meth labs.
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:42.740]  Yeah, and that's, well, there's no way to deal with that.
[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:43.960]  So that's part of what this is gonna do.
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:46.160]  But in the mix, we're getting caught in there.
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:48.560]  They worded it to put us, to fuck us up in there.
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:50.280]  So I'm scrolling through this guy's Facebook page
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:52.020]  because I had the page to where I could find
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:56.100]  the people's email addresses that we need to email
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:59.060]  so that we can try to stop this crap from happening.
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:01.000]  We all need that email.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.920]  I don't have kids, but my issue with this thing
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:08.320]  is there are a lot of new studies
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.720]  with cannabis helping a lot of children
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:13.320]  and a lot of families moving here
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:16.960]  to help their children for diseases,
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:20.080]  epilepsy, cancer, all kinds of things.
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:22.240]  And so how are you gonna make this bill
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:26.800]  that they can't cultivate medicine that their child needs?
[02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:28.340]  That's gonna be endangering them?
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:31.260]  Saving their life is going to be endangering them?
[02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:34.900]  I think that's a very completely hypocritical bill.
[02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:35.820]  Completely.
[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:39.500]  You have multi-million viewed videos
[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:44.340]  and such things on, in SMBC, on people doing stories
[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:47.940]  on how they're moving here, Marines and homemakers
[02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:49.700]  that don't even use marijuana,
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:51.860]  that are moving here just to cultivate it.
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:53.540]  And I mean, I would understand that this law
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:54.580]  would not even threaten them
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:56.700]  is what somebody would say who is in power.
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:41:58.640]  They would have nothing to worry about that
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:01.240]  because they would be under a court by state law, obviously.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.860]  They're not there to do it illegally.
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:05.020]  We're just going after the illegal people.
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:06.980]  But how many times would this law,
[02:42:06.980 --> 02:42:10.000]  if they don't amend it a couple more times,
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.680]  would that vague law fall into,
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:15.380]  oh, we came in and there was four people in there
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:18.720]  smoking a blunt and it's all smoky in there
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:20.720]  and the kids in the back room in the kitchen,
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:21.560]  and then-
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:22.380]  Kids in bed sleeping.
[02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:23.920]  I mean, you say you don't have kids,
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:26.240]  but I'm sure you know plenty of people who do.
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:27.940]  And let's say you went over there
[02:42:27.940 --> 02:42:30.740]  and you guys were out in the living room and getting down
[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:33.500]  and the kids are in the back or even in the backyard,
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:36.420]  and running in and out of the house like kids like to do.
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:38.940]  And cops come up, knock on the door.
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:41.300]  Are you gonna look like an irresponsible person?
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:43.140]  No, because you're in your own damn house
[02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:45.500]  exactly where the Colorado state law told you to be.
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:47.660]  So I'm a father, I'm a father,
[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:50.020]  and I'm obviously a grower.
[02:42:50.020 --> 02:42:52.940]  I don't have a big ass grow at my house.
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:54.180]  My daughter does not live with me.
[02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:55.020]  She lives with her mom
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:56.840]  partially because of what I do,
[02:42:56.840 --> 02:42:59.120]  because I think it's better to have her there.
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.760]  I feel a little, she doesn't need to be around my weed life.
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:03.600]  Let's just keep that away from her.
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:04.440]  She's a child.
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:07.320]  If she were to come here to the house
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:10.200]  and I happen to have, I wonder if my seeds would count.
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:11.040]  You know what I mean?
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:11.880]  Absolutely.
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:13.880]  If they were popped-
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:16.300]  No, I just mean some seeds in a bag, some seeds in a jar.
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:18.060]  What if the rig's sitting right here on the table?
[02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:20.960]  What if me and the kid come in and we walk in
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:22.320]  and the rig's just sitting there on the table?
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:23.840]  Is she suddenly a drug endangered child
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:25.020]  because the rig's on the table?
[02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:26.300]  And you know what else?
[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:27.420]  Edibles.
[02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:29.020]  They're really hunting on edibles right now
[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:29.940]  because of the way they're shaped,
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:31.460]  like candies and things like that.
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:33.580]  If you had your edibles sitting on the table-
[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:35.220]  Is that a drug endangered child?
[02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:38.580]  In my mind, that qualifies because that's fucked up.
[02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:39.420]  You failed.
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:42.980]  Your medical marijuana brownie or cookie
[02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:44.540]  should be treated just like your Percocets,
[02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:45.820]  your Vicodins, your heart medication.
[02:43:45.820 --> 02:43:46.660]  I agree with you.
[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:49.700]  So that is a drug endangered child, in my opinion.
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:52.700]  And I gotta support some kind of control
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:53.540]  and some kind of law.
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:55.200]  I love kids, I got my own kid.
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:56.600]  If you fed my kid a brownie,
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:58.160]  I'd fuck you up and press charges on you.
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:43:59.000]  Absolutely.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.200]  So that's your drug endangering my child
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.040]  is the way I gotta think about that.
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:04.360]  If we want this to be legalized and supported,
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:07.280]  we have to also support regulation.
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:09.400]  All this serious stuff is crushing my dabs.
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:12.300]  It also has to be reasonable regulation.
[02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:13.700]  That's just it.
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:16.440]  They write something with so much gray area.
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:17.640]  So much gray area.
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:20.520]  And then they're struggling to catch back up.
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:23.440]  They do the definitions after they make the regulations.
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:25.380]  Here's what we can do.
[02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:26.700]  It's like a Jeopardy phrase.
[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:27.700]  Here's what we can do.
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:30.020]  The bill's been written, it's been passed on,
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:30.860]  or it's been amended,
[02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:33.820]  and then it's been passed on to the next step.
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:36.340]  My friend Kevin A, I'm gonna try to say your name, dude.
[02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:37.180]  I've never tried to say it
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:38.860]  because I feel rude when I mess up people's names.
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:40.780]  It's, see there's an H and an M.
[02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:41.620]  Mimalji.
[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:43.980]  Yeah, Mimalji.
[02:44:43.980 --> 02:44:44.820]  Kevin Mimalji.
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:45.660]  I'm gonna be confident.
[02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:46.500]  Kevin Mimalji.
[02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:48.540]  Dude, if that's wrong, I'm fucking sorry.
[02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:49.820]  But this guy, he's a really great guy.
[02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:51.020]  He educates me.
[02:44:51.020 --> 02:44:52.740]  He says, we're looking for a few volunteers
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:54.520]  to help send a few emails over the weekend
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:56.880]  to the members of the state judiciary committee,
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:01.400]  urging them to vote no on Senate bills 177 and 178.
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:03.000]  By specifying controlled substance,
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.560]  whether illegal or legal,
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:07.000]  these bills inadvertently target marijuana consumers
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.920]  that are legally protected by amendment 20
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:12.040]  and amendment 64 of the Colorado constitution.
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:15.240]  Advocacy is about action, so just do it.
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:17.040]  Vote marijuana 2014.
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:19.600]  Kill SB 178.
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:22.460]  Here's a list of judiciary committee folks
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:24.680]  that we need to email, all right?
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:25.920]  I will tweet these.
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:29.400]  I'm gonna make myself a note right now to tweet these.
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:33.480]  But we want to email Lucia Guzman, Linda Newell,
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:37.440]  Michael Johnston, Steve King, and Kevin Lundberg,
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:40.800]  and I'll put all these emails in a tweet
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:42.000]  so that you guys can get those.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.760]  And if you've got some computer time,
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:45.880]  you're sitting there taking a dab,
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:48.280]  write one email, say please do not,
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:50.440]  yeah, copy and paste it to all these email addresses,
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:52.340]  or just type in all these email addresses,
[02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:54.900]  write one email, write like an adult,
[02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:57.700]  don't cuss them out, say please do not pass this,
[02:45:57.700 --> 02:45:59.460]  we find it unfair.
[02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:02.060]  If you are smarter than that, write something smart.
[02:46:02.060 --> 02:46:02.900]  But just don't sound like a dipshit.
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:04.420]  Take some time, you spell check.
[02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:06.640]  Yes, please, you're writing a professional letter here
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:07.700]  for something that's gonna count.
[02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:10.780]  And even for me, I'm a felon.
[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:13.380]  I can't vote, I can't get a passport,
[02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:15.620]  I can't leave the country, the military doesn't want me,
[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:18.220]  anything like that, I've already ruined all my chances.
[02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:23.220]  Even here, I feel obligated to do something
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:24.880]  because this is the state that I live in.
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:27.240]  And I mean, you told me last week
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:29.960]  when you mentioned this to me that this affects me.
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:34.280]  You know, pretty much anything with marijuana laws
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:35.480]  affect me, you know what I'm saying?
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:36.320]  Because-
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:38.440]  You've got kids, not a lot of our friends have kids,
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:39.600]  we talk about your kids a lot.
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:42.760]  When you're solo and when you're able to just
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:45.040]  catch a charge or even a ticket or whatever,
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:46.240]  and then it's done.
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:47.700]  It is what it is.
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:49.220]  Cops kick your ass, put you in jail for a night,
[02:46:49.220 --> 02:46:50.060]  you pay your fine, you're done.
[02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:50.900]  Yeah, that's easy when you're single.
[02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:51.720]  That's not it.
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:53.140]  I go to jail for three nights, you know,
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:54.620]  and that's more likely what's gonna happen.
[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:55.620]  I'm gonna go to jail on Friday
[02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:57.580]  and I'm not gonna get in right until Monday.
[02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:58.940]  Sounds like you've done this before, bro.
[02:46:58.940 --> 02:46:59.780]  Several times.
[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:02.500]  But that's what's gonna happen, you know?
[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:07.220]  And if you're here in Colorado, just, you know,
[02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:10.660]  it's like he said, take 15 minutes,
[02:47:10.660 --> 02:47:15.660]  write out a decent paragraph on why it should be
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:17.160]  rethought and free.
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:18.920]  You're gonna be playing on Facebook anyway.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:21.480]  You're gonna be on Instagram posting a fucking selfie.
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:24.600]  Yeah, and the Candy Crush saga sucks anyways, so.
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:28.960]  Oh man, all right, let's take a quick dab.
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:30.600]  I'm gonna play a song in the background.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.480]  What do we wanna hear?
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.920]  I know what we're gonna play.
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:34.320]  Kevin's got iMic.
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:35.160]  iMic?
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:35.980]  Yeah.
[02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:37.840]  That's not like an iDevice or anything.
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:39.920]  That's when you get so dabbed that you're using,
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:42.680]  it looks like he's using a magnifying glass.
[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:44.240]  It looks like he's using a periscope.
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:45.080]  That doesn't look like a.
[02:47:45.620 --> 02:47:47.060]  That doesn't look like a magnifying glass,
[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:47.900]  which you just did.
[02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:50.020]  Yeah, what's that hand motion there?
[02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:51.740]  Yeah, that was not it.
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:53.140]  I think they call that one the twisting shit.
[02:47:53.140 --> 02:47:54.700]  Yeah, it's twisted shit.
[02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:55.940]  I'm wondering if I play a song right here,
[02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:57.260]  if it's gonna make some shit drop out.
[02:47:57.260 --> 02:47:58.100]  So I'll just use a.
[02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:00.220]  All right, dab time again.
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:01.060]  Dab time again.
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:01.900]  Go ahead, bro.
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:03.060]  I'm trying to hand him the bowl, but he can't.
[02:48:03.060 --> 02:48:04.260]  I got one sitting here.
[02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:07.940]  iTunes, there we go.
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:10.300]  This could be loud, guys.
[02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:12.840]  I apologize if this comes in real loud.
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:13.680]  Jam it.
[02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:16.220]  Oh, man.
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:18.380]  There we go.
[02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:19.220]  It's a little task rock.
[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:20.040]  It was good.
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.060]  I knew it.
[02:48:21.060 --> 02:48:23.020]  I can read your mind.
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:25.060]  Yeah, mind bullets.
[02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:25.900]  So we're gonna take a dab
[02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:26.900]  and we're gonna change the vibe of the show
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:27.860]  because it's been real newsy.
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:29.380]  We were dabbed the fuck out at the start.
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:32.180]  We're gonna get back into a fun vibe here.
[02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:33.020]  That was pretty rough.
[02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:33.840]  I get it.
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:34.680]  It wasn't rough.
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:35.620]  It was weird high as shit,
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:38.180]  and I've never tried to do a podcast that high before.
[02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:39.500]  I was like, yeah, sure.
[02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:40.620]  Let's talk about news.
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:42.620]  And then I was like, wait, it's my turn?
[02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:43.460]  And so.
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:45.800]  See, it's different when we all look at you
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:46.960]  with the microphone, right?
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:48.320]  Nah, it's fine.
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:49.600]  Task rock, I hope you don't get mad at me
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:51.160]  for playing your songs in the background, brother.
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:52.520]  I hope it'll benefit you.
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:54.720]  Task rock, Taskin' Linus, TNL the Movement.
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:57.680]  I'm gonna do a dab.
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:58.520]  I just grabbed the rig.
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:48:59.340]  I hope it's my turn.
[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:00.320]  There's only one rig at the table today.
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:01.160]  What the fuck?
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:02.200]  We're failing.
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:03.160]  Every time I come over here,
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:05.160]  you're like, oh, I'm gonna show you all my rigs.
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:06.360]  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:08.920]  It's like, dude, I'm just gonna come over here
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:10.040]  with a cabinet one time
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:11.760]  and just slide it into the back of the room
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:12.600]  and he's gonna be like, what's that for?
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:14.780]  I mean, that's your bookshelf for all your rigs.
[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:16.780]  I should just bring them all to the table.
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:17.620]  Oh, dude.
[02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:19.580]  There wouldn't be room for anything else.
[02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:21.500]  Do it one time.
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:23.100]  All right, now I'm dabbing out the little roster rig.
[02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:24.540]  Do it one time when you only have three guests.
[02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:27.460]  That way, you know, you can have it all on that end of the.
[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:28.860]  All right, some grateful dog dabs
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:30.180]  done by Elevated Concentrations.
[02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:31.020]  Here we go.
[02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:31.860]  Uh-oh.
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:32.680]  Ooh.
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:35.830]  ♪ But I hate to count, but hate to mount ♪
[02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:36.670]  Uh-oh.
[02:49:36.670 --> 02:49:42.300]  ♪ Some would say that I'm stuck on a bad hook ♪
[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:44.620]  ♪ Working the dicks and teaching the plants to mend ♪
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:47.120]  ♪ So he learns how to fish, oil up the bucket ♪
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:47.960]  All right.
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:49.440]  That was a man dab.
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:52.280]  Holy crap, I didn't even cough.
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:54.320]  I'm still blowing smoke out of my left ear.
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:58.760]  All right, the Cannabis Cup is this weekend.
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:00.480]  Ooh, the Denver Cannabis Cup.
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:02.520]  I look forward to seeing everybody.
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:03.920]  I don't have a booth.
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:05.320]  I don't have a booth or anything.
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:06.800]  I'm throwing down a few packs of seeds
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:07.640]  at a couple of booths.
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.000]  They're gonna do some giveaways and whatnot.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.320]  And then I'm just gonna roam around
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:13.680]  and high five people and meet people.
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:16.080]  Have a good time.
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:18.520]  So you guys are probably catching this episode
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:19.500]  right before the Cannabis Cup.
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:21.080]  So find me there and say what's up.
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:21.920]  Holy crap.
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:23.760]  That's a tasty dab, man.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:26.160]  You guys make me jelly.
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:27.980]  Like, I'm fully.
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:30.760]  It's my favorite day of the year.
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:32.840]  This is the Cannabis Cup.
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:36.240]  I've been watching it for almost like five or six years
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:38.840]  steadily, you know, on YouTube and so forth.
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:40.640]  And it's...
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:42.600]  It's the most fun I ever have.
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:43.440]  Yeah.
[02:50:43.940 --> 02:50:45.940]  You just get a GoPro and just, you know.
[02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:46.780]  Just strap the GoPro to your chest.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:48.900]  It seems like every year is more fun
[02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:50.300]  because I meet more people.
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:51.140]  I know more people.
[02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:52.700]  I mean, imagine looking back 20 years, you know,
[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:54.260]  at that footage of you,
[02:50:54.260 --> 02:50:56.940]  like the first couple of years, Cannabis Cup.
[02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:59.060]  And then, yeah.
[02:50:59.060 --> 02:50:59.900]  Yeah.
[02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:00.720]  Yeah.
[02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:01.700]  That's gonna be fun.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:04.300]  So there's also a big event in Civic Center Park.
[02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:05.140]  Indeed.
[02:51:05.140 --> 02:51:06.620]  Indeed.
[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:09.540]  The event in Civic Center Park that they do,
[02:51:09.540 --> 02:51:11.460]  they will not allow cannabis smoking.
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:14.760]  But guess what they will allow?
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:15.720]  Bullshit.
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:17.360]  Some bullshit.
[02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:19.680]  Denver City officials expect organizers
[02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:22.040]  of this weekend's 420 event at Denver Civic Center Park
[02:51:22.040 --> 02:51:24.240]  to actively discourage public pot smoking,
[02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:27.880]  an activity that is illegal under Colorado law.
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:29.780]  I'm gonna turn down the task rod here.
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.720]  That's, this song is called Do It Again, by the way.
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:36.880]  I forgot to shut it down.
[02:51:36.880 --> 02:51:37.720]  I was just loving it.
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:38.560]  Yeah.
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:39.400]  Yeah.
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:40.240]  Sounding iry in the background.
[02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:42.180]  It always sounds fucking iry.
[02:51:43.460 --> 02:51:45.660]  This article I'm reading is coming from
[02:51:46.700 --> 02:51:48.740]  Toke of the Town, by the way.
[02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:52.020]  And it's written by William Breeds.
[02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:52.860]  Cool.
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:53.680]  Good writing, bro.
[02:51:54.740 --> 02:51:56.940]  So they will discourage public pot smoking.
[02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:57.780]  It's illegal.
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:00.380]  However, liquor will be sold and can be consumed
[02:52:00.380 --> 02:52:02.820]  at the McNichols Building on the Civic Center Complex
[02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:04.140]  during the festival.
[02:52:04.140 --> 02:52:07.740]  Among those who see this situation as a contradictory
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:10.840]  is Miguel Lopez, the 420 Weekend's organizer
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:14.040]  who applied for the right to sell beer in the first place.
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:15.880]  Kev's got his hand up.
[02:52:15.880 --> 02:52:16.700]  First question.
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:17.540]  Let's hear it, dude.
[02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:20.400]  Isn't it also illegal to drink in public?
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:21.240]  Boom.
[02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:24.440]  There it is.
[02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:26.200]  That's just the first basic question.
[02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:28.680]  It says the beer and liquor will not be allowed
[02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:32.160]  outside the McNichols Building during the two-day event.
[02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:33.000]  Okay.
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.120]  People can't just get it and go outside.
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:37.360]  It's in a controlled area, is actually what it says.
[02:52:37.940 --> 02:52:38.860]  Yeah.
[02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:41.300]  Okay, well that kind of fucks that up.
[02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:44.140]  Well, yeah, but man, so this will be-
[02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:45.300]  It's a 420 event.
[02:52:45.300 --> 02:52:48.380]  How are you gonna fucking have alcohol and not weed?
[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:50.540]  Well, they're trying to discourage us from smoking pot
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:51.540]  and giving us booze.
[02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:52.380]  Yeah.
[02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:53.220]  So let's see-
[02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:54.040]  Make it more dangerous.
[02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:55.260]  And I'm not hoping for bad shit.
[02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:56.700]  I'm really hoping it goes well,
[02:52:56.700 --> 02:52:59.340]  but let's see if DUIs increase.
[02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:00.860]  Let's see if there's problems.
[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:03.900]  It's a perfect case study right here.
[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:07.100]  We'll find out that alcohol is dangerous
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:08.680]  and cannabis is safer.
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:11.240]  Have you not seen that case study they did on LA
[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:14.800]  or whatever where they put a numerous amount of people
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:16.160]  behind the wheel high?
[02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:17.800]  And in most of the times that came out,
[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:20.080]  they had a higher percentage of staying in.
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:22.000]  They were more aware.
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:22.840]  I would believe you.
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:24.640]  I haven't read it, so I can't condone driving
[02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:26.120]  under the influence of any substance.
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:28.880]  No, they were close course, but that's what I'm saying.
[02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:29.720]  Is it was-
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:30.680]  He's got a lawyer over there.
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:32.600]  He got a patent lawyer, you know?
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:33.440]  Yeah.
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:34.280]  Yeah.
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:36.360]  No, but no, I fucking...
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:37.740]  I believe you.
[02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:38.560]  Yeah.
[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:40.020]  I totally believe that that could fucking work that way
[02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:43.380]  because sometimes I feel like I got to calm down
[02:53:43.380 --> 02:53:46.140]  and smoke some weed and my brain goes too fast.
[02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:48.580]  I have a better case study.
[02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:49.420]  Oh yeah?
[02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:53.540]  Let's nobody buy any alcohol and see their revenue shit.
[02:53:53.540 --> 02:53:54.380]  Like-
[02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:55.220]  I vote that.
[02:53:55.220 --> 02:53:56.300]  Don't buy any booze?
[02:53:56.300 --> 02:53:59.340]  Yeah, see them shit themselves for spending all this money
[02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:02.420]  on fucking vending and shit that they don't sell
[02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:03.540]  a single one.
[02:54:03.540 --> 02:54:04.380]  Not one.
[02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:05.700]  Bring flask of tinctures.
[02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:06.960]  Not one.
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:10.760]  Just sit there and swig tinctures all day.
[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:13.680]  Oh gosh, people are going to be wrecked.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:15.080]  Going to be wrecked.
[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:19.120]  So speaking of being wrecked, I was kind of saying,
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:20.440]  let's see if there's going to be more DUIs.
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:23.000]  Guys, be safe and be smart for us, please.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.400]  You're probably listening to this on 420 weekend,
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:26.920]  which means the cops are paying attention.
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:27.820]  The shit's catching on.
[02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:30.280]  They know what's up, especially here in Colorado.
[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:33.280]  If you're in California, Washington, Oregon, Michigan,
[02:54:33.300 --> 02:54:34.380]  places where they have,
[02:54:34.380 --> 02:54:37.360]  where the medical scene is getting popular
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:39.540]  and just weed is getting rampant,
[02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:41.020]  they're going to be watching for us to be high.
[02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:43.900]  And they're going to try to find people to make examples of
[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:47.180]  and revenue off of, because they don't like us potheads.
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:49.560]  Even though we voted it in, a lot of the officials
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:51.180]  and the police do not like it.
[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:53.420]  So they're going to try to find ways to fuck us.
[02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:54.700]  So be careful.
[02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:56.460]  They see it as a money-making revenue.
[02:54:56.460 --> 02:54:58.260]  Alcohol is just a lube to fuck you.
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:01.460]  Yeah, I'm not a big-
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:02.740]  Don't buy any of it.
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:04.080]  Don't buy it.
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:05.720]  If you're a responsible drinker, that's cool,
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:08.800]  but please don't be over-dabbed even.
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:10.560]  Like, yeah, be safe.
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:11.380]  Be safe.
[02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:12.220]  We love you guys.
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:13.520]  We want to have you back for more episodes.
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:15.160]  So don't buy beer.
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:17.760]  Yeah, no beer on 420.
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:19.640]  No beer on 420.
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:23.300]  That's for March 17th.
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:27.040]  Okay, March 17th.
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:29.780]  March 17th through March 20th, no beer.
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:33.400]  But then on St. Patrick's Day, get totally, totally shitted.
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:35.000]  Yeah, whatever you want to do.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.720]  Just be careful then, too.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:38.600]  All right, I'm stoked for the Cannabis Cup, dude.
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.360]  There's going to be people from all around the world.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:41.880]  I get to see a lot of my good friends.
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:43.560]  The guys that make my shirt, Handmade Apparel,
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:44.380]  will be there.
[02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:45.520]  Our homie TaskRock will be there.
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:46.360]  Fuck yes.
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:48.040]  Coral Reifer, you can't be there, sweetie.
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:48.880]  I'll miss you.
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:50.280]  Here's a big digital hug for you.
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:51.120]  Can you feel it?
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:52.200]  It's a virtual hug.
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:53.560]  That's my buddy, Miss Coral Reifer.
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:54.720]  It's a friend of ours.
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:56.440]  She likes to say hi to us every time.
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:55:57.840]  I don't even want to-
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:55:59.680]  Say hi, because she'll probably listen.
[02:56:00.500 --> 02:56:01.340]  Are you a fan of Miss Coral?
[02:56:01.340 --> 02:56:02.460]  You should see the look on this dude's face, Coral.
[02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:03.860]  I think he might be a fan.
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:05.860]  Nah, way before she was in it.
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:07.660]  I mean, I remember when Paul introduced her
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:08.500]  and shit like that.
[02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:10.260]  Like, oh, this is so-and-so.
[02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:11.100]  You know, let me check her out.
[02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:12.580]  Oh, yeah, dude, we've seen her change.
[02:56:12.580 --> 02:56:15.380]  We've seen her change from this petite little tiny girl.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:17.620]  She's turned into a full-on cannabis queen now.
[02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:18.860]  She's pretty badass.
[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:19.700]  It's a cool girl.
[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:20.520]  Got a lot of respect for that girl.
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:22.620]  It's not like, oh, my eyes shine for her.
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:26.420]  It's more like I've watched her gain her YouTube career.
[02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:27.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:56:27.260 --> 02:56:29.420]  She's part of what inspired this podcast, dude.
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:32.160]  Me being a Twitch streamer slash, you know,
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:34.880]  that's essentially, I've loved to do YouTube
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:36.000]  for a long time, but it's-
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:36.840]  Give yourself a shout out.
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:38.720]  Where does somebody find your dumb ass?
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.040]  Overgrowthegov.com, or overgrowthegov.twitch.
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:44.080]  Overgrowthegov.twitch.
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:44.920]  All right.
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:46.560]  No, actually, Coral's part of what inspired this show.
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:48.880]  She knows the news, she does the talk,
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:51.520]  she's really friendly, but she doesn't know about Grow.
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:53.240]  And so I fill in the blank where Coral
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:54.160]  misses with the Grow.
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:55.760]  She tried there first for a good time.
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:57.800]  But I mean, it's not her wheelhouse,
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:56:59.700]  no offense to her, it's just not her wheelhouse.
[02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:02.860]  She does plenty of other, she's a social media genius.
[02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:04.020]  I don't know how she keeps up.
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:05.340]  All right, I'm gonna read one more article.
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:06.220]  We're gonna take a couple dabs,
[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:07.060]  and then we're gonna end this episode,
[02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:09.300]  get out of here quick and easy.
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:10.620]  It's 420, man.
[02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:14.180]  We could be this dabbed and do a half quick episode.
[02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:15.020]  Jeez.
[02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:15.860]  Yeah.
[02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:16.680]  All right.
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:17.520]  Whoa.
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:18.360]  Whoa.
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:20.820]  I just got real personal.
[02:57:20.820 --> 02:57:21.780]  Don't, don't, yeah.
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:24.420]  All right, don't pull out in here, you'll make a mess.
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:26.260]  Here's an article from the Cannabist.
[02:57:28.260 --> 02:57:30.980]  It doesn't give anybody any credit for writing it.
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:32.060]  No person.
[02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:33.580]  I'm trying to find his name.
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:34.860]  I like to give people credit.
[02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:37.020]  It just says,
[02:57:37.020 --> 02:57:38.380]  no, New York.
[02:57:38.380 --> 02:57:39.940]  That's who gets credit is New York.
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:41.540]  Where the credit goes is New York.
[02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:43.700]  So a small study of casual marijuana smokers
[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:46.420]  has turned up evidence of changes in the brain.
[02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:50.400]  A possible sign of trouble ahead, researchers say.
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.140]  The young adults who volunteered for the study
[02:57:52.140 --> 02:57:53.620]  were not dependent on pot,
[02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:56.380]  nor did they show any marijuana related problems.
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:59.720]  What we think we're seeing here is a very early indication
[02:57:59.720 --> 02:58:03.120]  of what becomes a problem later on with prolonged use.
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:05.400]  Things like lack of focus and impaired judgment,
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:07.280]  said Dr. Hans Breiter.
[02:58:07.280 --> 02:58:09.780]  That's gotta be a German name, a study author.
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:12.440]  Longer term studies will be needed to see
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:15.540]  if such brain changes cause any symptoms over time.
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:18.880]  Like how long, dude, we've been smoking weed
[02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:20.640]  for a hundred and something years.
[02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:21.720]  Like, man.
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:23.400]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:24.240]  A lot longer than that.
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:25.080]  No, I'm just being like, like.
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:25.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:26.540 --> 02:58:29.740]  With all, you've seen the cannabinoid receptors
[02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:30.740]  we have in the brain now.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:31.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:33.380]  That's been found in the past five years.
[02:58:33.380 --> 02:58:36.380]  Now that they just opened research one month ago.
[02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:38.120]  Previous studies have shown mixed results
[02:58:38.120 --> 02:58:40.180]  in looking for brain changes from marijuana use,
[02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:44.860]  perhaps because of difference in the techniques used.
[02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:46.220]  Different strokes. He and others noted
[02:58:46.220 --> 02:58:50.100]  in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.
[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:52.940]  What that makes me think, guess what he's thinking?
[02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:55.700]  Well, they don't know because they're not in the scene.
[02:58:56.480 --> 02:58:57.480]  Kev's looking at me like he knows what I'm leading to.
[02:58:57.480 --> 02:58:59.480]  It's the dabs, bro.
[02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:02.000]  Concentrates and because of the new advanced
[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:02.840]  ways of consuming.
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:03.680]  All right.
[02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:04.800]  The study is among the first to focus
[02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.120]  on possible brain effects in recreational pot smokers,
[02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:09.280]  said Dr. Nora Volkow,
[02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:11.840]  Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:13.640]  The federal agency helped pay for the work.
[02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:16.120]  She called the work important, but preliminary.
[02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:18.800]  The 20 pot users in the study, ages 18 to 25,
[02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:20.760]  said they smoked marijuana an average
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:23.240]  of about four days a week for an average of,
[02:59:23.260 --> 02:59:25.860]  average total of about 11 joints.
[02:59:25.860 --> 02:59:28.180]  Half of them smoked fewer than six joints a week.
[02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:30.460]  Researchers scanned their brains and compared the results
[02:59:30.460 --> 02:59:33.460]  of those 20 non-users, compared those results
[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:35.660]  to 20 non-users who were matched of age,
[02:59:35.660 --> 02:59:37.380]  sex and other traits.
[02:59:37.380 --> 02:59:39.700]  The results showed differences in two brain areas
[02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:41.960]  associated with emotion and motivation.
[02:59:44.460 --> 02:59:46.300]  It's hard to argue with.
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:47.620]  Yeah.
[02:59:47.620 --> 02:59:50.940]  Part of the brain and the nucleus acumen.
[02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:51.860]  I don't know how to say that word.
[02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:52.780]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:59:53.280 --> 02:59:55.200]  The user showed higher density than non-users,
[02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:59.440]  as well as different differences in shape of those areas.
[02:59:59.440 --> 03:00:01.260]  Both differences were more pronounced
[03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:03.880]  in those who reported smoking more marijuana.
[03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:09.920]  Doctor also said large studies are needed
[03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:12.520]  to explore whether casual to moderate marijuana use
[03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:15.040]  really does cause anatomical brain changes.
[03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:18.000]  And if so, whether that leads to any impairment.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.240]  The current work doesn't determine whether casual
[03:00:20.260 --> 03:00:23.260]  to moderate marijuana use is harmful to the brain, she said.
[03:00:24.820 --> 03:00:25.740]  So we can see changes,
[03:00:25.740 --> 03:00:28.140]  but we don't know if it's harmful yet.
[03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:30.860]  Casual to moderate, I would say maybe,
[03:00:30.860 --> 03:00:33.120]  maybe you really got high four times a week.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:34.740]  That would be casual to moderate to me.
[03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:35.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:00:35.580 --> 03:00:36.940]  Like somebody had it.
[03:00:36.940 --> 03:00:39.380]  Like you didn't buy weed or anything like that,
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:42.540]  or just when somebody had it, like, hey, you know,
[03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:43.900]  and you smoked what they had,
[03:00:43.900 --> 03:00:47.060]  that would be acceptable to casual to moderate to me.
[03:00:47.060 --> 03:00:48.940]  Anything besides that, you're a user.
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:53.960]  And you use it to get that chemical change.
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:56.080]  You know, I mean, dude,
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:59.020]  don't we have certain strains that help us get motivated?
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:00.760]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:01.600]  That's true.
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:04.160]  I'm ready to do stuff.
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:05.000]  Like, I'm ready to go.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  Yeah, if I smoke some sour diesel, I can't sit down.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:09.720]  Like I'll think I'm gonna smoke a bowl
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:10.760]  and watch a movie or something.
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:13.120]  I'll smoke sour diesel and end up doing the damn dishes.
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:14.960]  I feel like that with pretty much anything
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:16.960]  that I feel like gets me high though.
[03:01:16.980 --> 03:01:18.980]  I mean, as soon as I get high, I get motivated.
[03:01:18.980 --> 03:01:21.220]  I mean, I'm not that lazy stoner, you know?
[03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:24.460]  That's why we're all three here though.
[03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:25.940]  There are a bunch of people that are not here
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:27.780]  because they're the opposite of us.
[03:01:27.780 --> 03:01:32.260]  When you work in the garden, you like to be well.
[03:01:32.260 --> 03:01:34.220]  Oh yeah, I'll take a few dabs for sure.
[03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:35.380]  Absolutely.
[03:01:35.380 --> 03:01:38.420]  That way it gets you, you're not sidetracked with this.
[03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:41.360]  You're focusing on one thing at a time.
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:44.260]  You know, I feel that same way doing construction
[03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:45.580]  and stuff down there in Florida, man.
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:47.520]  I'm gonna be fucking baked all day.
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:48.880]  Fuck you, superintendent.
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:51.160]  You're sitting in your truck while I'm blowing down
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:52.440]  and setting trusses.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:54.880]  What are you gonna do, climb up here and get me, fat boy?
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:57.840]  You know, like you're sitting down there for a reason.
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:01.880]  I've never been that type of person
[03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:06.440]  to really smoke and be unmotivated, you know?
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:08.600]  Like I could definitely see it, you know,
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:10.520]  if it's just me and her sitting around the house
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:13.040]  and we don't have anything to do, yeah.
[03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:14.840]  Yeah, but it doesn't ruin your motivation.
[03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:15.740]  No, no.
[03:02:15.740 --> 03:02:17.100]  All right, well, they continue to say
[03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:18.380]  the effects of marijuana can occur
[03:02:18.380 --> 03:02:20.220]  much earlier than previously thought.
[03:02:20.220 --> 03:02:22.220]  Some of the effect may depend on a person's age
[03:02:22.220 --> 03:02:24.140]  when marijuana use starts, he said.
[03:02:24.140 --> 03:02:25.940]  Another brain researcher of the state
[03:02:25.940 --> 03:02:27.780]  of University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
[03:02:28.900 --> 03:02:29.740]  That's odd.
[03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:31.040]  Is that just one new state?
[03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:34.120]  Wisconsin-Milwaukee?
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:37.060]  No, okay, sorry, I'm dabbed.
[03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:37.900]  I don't know.
[03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:39.580]  It's just all one word.
[03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:40.420]  I, um.
[03:02:40.420 --> 03:02:42.220]  She said her own work has found similar results.
[03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:44.460]  I think the clear message is we see brain alterations
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:46.200]  before you develop dependence.
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:49.400]  So that says that your brain is starting to change
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:52.560]  before we notice that we're craving some dabs again.
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:55.280]  I don't know how you guys feel about that article.
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:02:58.040]  Some of it seemed, I don't feel like as a kid,
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:01.160]  when I was young getting high,
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:03.200]  it was like, oh, I need to get high.
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:06.440]  It was all along the lines of when I could get it
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:09.420]  and when it came around, you know?
[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:12.600]  I'm talking about 16, 17, living in Gainesville, Florida.
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:15.180]  Like, it was everywhere,
[03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:18.780]  but it still wasn't everywhere for a 17-year-old.
[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:20.860]  You know, you had to have your skate rat friends
[03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:23.380]  that, you know, older brother who,
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:26.020]  that one guy that knew that one guy
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:27.500]  that would actually sell to a teenager.
[03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:28.340]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:03:28.340 --> 03:03:30.100]  I mean, it's, I don't know.
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:31.980]  I mean, that was years and years and years ago,
[03:03:31.980 --> 03:03:34.540]  but that's the way it was back then.
[03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:36.100]  So glad that I grew up in California
[03:03:36.100 --> 03:03:38.340]  to where there's just always some luck somewhere.
[03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:40.020]  And then I moved to Colorado right at the right time.
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:41.380]  Well, I've been here for 20 years now,
[03:03:41.380 --> 03:03:42.340]  but I mean, it was the right time.
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:44.360]  I've got a buddy that lives in California.
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:45.200]  He's always like,
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:47.360]  huh, man, that's just the way it's been over here.
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:48.520]  Yeah, he doesn't even know.
[03:03:48.520 --> 03:03:50.640]  He's my age and he's never,
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:53.420]  he's like, dude, we blow all the time.
[03:03:53.420 --> 03:03:54.400]  He's like, what is a cop gonna do?
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:55.720]  He's gonna roll up, tell us, put it out.
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:57.120]  He's probably gonna write one of us a ticket,
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:03:58.320]  whoever's holding it.
[03:03:58.320 --> 03:03:59.160]  That'd be the end of it.
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:00.000]  Maybe.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:00.820]  End of it.
[03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:01.660]  Yep.
[03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:04.080]  And I'm like, well, fuck you, you know?
[03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:05.120]  I'm still like,
[03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:11.000]  still pussing in the corner.
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:11.840]  Yeah.
[03:04:12.340 --> 03:04:13.180]  I can't, dude.
[03:04:13.180 --> 03:04:14.000]  It's still there.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:17.260]  And I feel like it's gonna be there for a while.
[03:04:18.660 --> 03:04:21.580]  It's just something that I've grown up with.
[03:04:21.580 --> 03:04:23.580]  I mean, it's great that I can sit in my home
[03:04:23.580 --> 03:04:25.420]  and feel comfortable or-
[03:04:25.420 --> 03:04:28.300]  Well, you could until the new Senate bill is coming out.
[03:04:28.300 --> 03:04:29.980]  Or drive from point A to point B
[03:04:29.980 --> 03:04:31.580]  and not worried about getting pulled over.
[03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:33.980]  And like, yeah, that's one of the best parts
[03:04:33.980 --> 03:04:35.780]  is being able to just roll with,
[03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:39.020]  I've got my dab rig in the car and I'm cruising.
[03:04:39.020 --> 03:04:40.940]  I think it's pretty funny sometimes.
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:41.960]  I just forget, you know?
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:45.560]  I'm like, oh man, a few months ago or a couple years ago.
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:46.440]  I'm spoiled.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:47.280]  Yeah.
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:48.360]  I'm spoiled.
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:49.760]  All right.
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:51.160]  It's a low energy show, you guys.
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:52.520]  I'm sorry we're dabbed as shit.
[03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:54.120]  I hope we made any sense.
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:55.480]  Not to mention it's-
[03:04:55.480 --> 03:04:56.720]  It's 420, man.
[03:04:56.720 --> 03:04:59.120]  Come on, we're recording a 420 weekend show.
[03:04:59.120 --> 03:04:59.960]  Yeah, and-
[03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:01.640]  If you guys see me at the Cannabis Cup on 420,
[03:05:01.640 --> 03:05:02.560]  if you know what I look like,
[03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:06.400]  I'm six foot five, I got dreadlocks down to my ass.
[03:05:06.400 --> 03:05:08.840]  I'm probably wearing an Irie Genetics T-shirt
[03:05:08.860 --> 03:05:10.860]  and or hoodie or something similar.
[03:05:11.940 --> 03:05:13.780]  Rocking some Dickies most of the time.
[03:05:13.780 --> 03:05:18.380]  I'll be wearing a black hat with an Irie Genetics pin on it.
[03:05:18.380 --> 03:05:20.300]  I only have one, that's how you can spot me.
[03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:22.340]  I only have one pin on my hat.
[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:24.540]  Everybody else at the cup will have millions of pins
[03:05:24.540 --> 03:05:26.340]  and I'm the guy with one.
[03:05:26.340 --> 03:05:27.460]  So if you see me,
[03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:29.340]  I can't promise you that I'll have any gifts for you.
[03:05:29.340 --> 03:05:30.220]  I may have a sticker,
[03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:32.940]  but I don't know that I'll have any beans to give away
[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:34.220]  after the first hour
[03:05:34.220 --> 03:05:36.540]  because I'm gonna get swamped with some stuff.
[03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:37.820]  But if you see me, come introduce yourself.
[03:05:37.840 --> 03:05:38.760]  Say hi to me.
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:39.680]  Tell me if you like the show.
[03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:40.680]  Tell me if you hate the show.
[03:05:40.680 --> 03:05:41.520]  Just come chat with me.
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:42.340]  I'm a friendly dude.
[03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:43.520]  I like to meet people.
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:45.680]  There's a good chance I'll be hanging out with Kevin.
[03:05:45.680 --> 03:05:46.760]  We're gonna go separately.
[03:05:46.760 --> 03:05:47.760]  We're gonna hang out together.
[03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:48.760]  We're gonna do different shit,
[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:51.240]  but you'll see us together and hanging out.
[03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:52.080]  Feel free to say hi to me.
[03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:53.040]  I like meeting you guys.
[03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:54.720]  I really do.
[03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:56.520]  Anybody got any cool shit to say at the end of the show?
[03:05:56.520 --> 03:05:58.360]  Any plugs or anything?
[03:05:58.360 --> 03:05:59.200]  No.
[03:05:59.200 --> 03:06:00.020]  No?
[03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:00.860]  No, I'm sorry.
[03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:01.700]  I don't.
[03:06:01.700 --> 03:06:02.520]  No, that's cool.
[03:06:02.520 --> 03:06:03.360]  That's cool.
[03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:04.200]  You write your-
[03:06:04.200 --> 03:06:05.020]  420, Cannabis Cup.
[03:06:05.020 --> 03:06:05.960]  Write the people from Senate.
[03:06:05.980 --> 03:06:07.660]  Yeah, write the people that we need to write to
[03:06:07.660 --> 03:06:09.300]  to stop this Senate bill from happening.
[03:06:09.300 --> 03:06:10.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:06:10.420 --> 03:06:12.920]  Thanks for checking out the iGrow Culture podcast.
[03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:15.180]  Check us out at Twitter, at iGrow Culture.
[03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:17.060]  Like I always say, let me know if we're doing a good job
[03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:18.220]  or a bad job.
[03:06:18.220 --> 03:06:19.620]  Feedback is feedback either way.
[03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:21.420]  I take them both seriously.
[03:06:21.420 --> 03:06:22.260]  There's an Instagram.
[03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:23.300]  I don't post a lot there,
[03:06:23.300 --> 03:06:26.020]  but I do post a lot at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:28.340]  There's a lot of great weed pictures.

[03:06:34.420 --> 03:06:36.480]  I'm gonna play a little bit of Task Rock for you.
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:38.280]  We're gonna take a dab,
[03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:39.680]  and then I'm gonna leave the mics on
[03:06:39.680 --> 03:06:41.120]  while we take a dab and just bullshit
[03:06:41.120 --> 03:06:42.200]  through the end of this song.
[03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:43.600]  So, hey guys, thanks for joining us.
[03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:45.400]  Have a safe and happy 420.
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:46.840]  We'll be back.
[03:06:46.840 --> 03:06:49.960]  We'll record another episode probably Monday or Tuesday,
[03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:53.040]  the 20-somethings, the 22nd-ish, probably,
[03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:54.160]  and then we'll get that up soon.
[03:06:54.160 --> 03:06:55.200]  And that will be,
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:56.640]  that show will be a little more high energy,
[03:06:56.640 --> 03:06:59.280]  and we'll do our review of the Cannabis Cup.
[03:06:59.280 --> 03:07:00.120]  That'll be dope.
[03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:01.160]  Yeah, that should be fun.
[03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:02.000]  Should be, Irie?
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:02.880]  That would be.
[03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:04.000]  All right, we'll leave the mics on.
[03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:06.540]  I'm gonna click in some Task Rock for you.
[03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:10.740]  This is, what is, what is I playing?
[03:07:10.740 --> 03:07:13.620]  I'm having some technical issues with my face.
[03:07:13.620 --> 03:07:16.620]  This is Northern Lights featuring Action Bronson
[03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:17.820]  from Task Rock.
[03:07:17.820 --> 03:07:18.660]  Enjoy, guys.
[03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:19.500]  We're taking some dabs.
[03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:20.320]  Yep.
[03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:23.540]  ♪ You put the flour in the grinder and crank it ♪
[03:07:23.540 --> 03:07:24.420]  Mic's still on, bro,
[03:07:24.420 --> 03:07:26.620]  so talk all kinds of mad shit about someone you don't like.
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:27.620]  Oh, damn it.
[03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:31.100]  ♪ Call the rise to the occasion ♪
[03:07:31.100 --> 03:07:31.940]  Let's see here.
[03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:32.780]  Fuck.
[03:07:33.760 --> 03:07:35.960]  Motherfuck, Dre, motherfuck, stupid.
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:39.760]  No, the mic's really on, and I'm joking, man.
[03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:40.600]  Come on.
[03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:41.440]  I'm not.
[03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:42.260]  I'm not.
[03:07:42.260 --> 03:07:43.100]  I'm not.
[03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:43.940]  I'm not.
[03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:44.760]  I'm not.
[03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:45.600]  I'm not.
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:50.360]  I went down there to the park walk the other day,
[03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:51.640]  down there past the spillway,
[03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:53.320]  and I saw that rope swing.
[03:07:53.320 --> 03:07:54.480]  Is that the one he was talking about
[03:07:54.480 --> 03:07:55.400]  up underneath the bridge?
[03:07:55.400 --> 03:07:56.240]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:07:56.240 --> 03:07:57.060]  Yeah?
[03:07:57.060 --> 03:07:57.900]  Yeah.
[03:07:57.900 --> 03:07:58.720]  Yeah, I'm gonna call his ass out here
[03:07:58.720 --> 03:07:59.840]  in a couple weeks on that,
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:01.000]  once it gets warm.
[03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:01.840]  I'm like, come on.
[03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:03.420]  You used to do it.
[03:08:03.420 --> 03:08:04.260]  What's wrong now?
[03:08:04.260 --> 03:08:05.100]  You guys can go for a walk.
[03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:06.900]  Yeah, you guys can still go do it.
[03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:07.940]  Holy crap.
[03:08:07.940 --> 03:08:09.300]  I'll go on the hike with you,
[03:08:09.300 --> 03:08:10.500]  but I ain't getting in that water.
[03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:11.340]  Yeah?
[03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:12.160]  Is it cold?
[03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:13.000]  I ain't put my dreads in that shit.
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:13.840]  Oh, yeah, fuck that.
[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:16.300]  I'm not putting my dreadlocks in that water.
[03:08:16.300 --> 03:08:17.140]  I got down there the other day.
[03:08:17.140 --> 03:08:18.740]  Could you imagine what would grow out of my head
[03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:20.820]  if I put my dreadlocks in that fucking water?
[03:08:20.820 --> 03:08:22.060]  Dude, it would be amazing.
[03:08:22.060 --> 03:08:23.540]  It'd be like a human plant.
[03:08:25.100 --> 03:08:25.940]  It would be bad.
[03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:28.340]  Swamp thang.
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:29.840]  Yeah.
[03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:32.440]  So you should apologize for the people
[03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:33.480]  you were talking shit to,
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:34.880]  because you didn't mean that.
[03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:38.240]  Sorry, Dre and Snoop.
[03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:40.040]  No, we were just kidding.
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:41.280]  We're gonna leave all this into the show,
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:42.120]  because it's fucking,
[03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:44.240]  this is the highest energy we've had all night.
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:45.320]  I'm gonna take a mean dab.
[03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:47.800]  Can you guys agree that this is a mean dab?
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:48.640]  That is.
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:52.200]  I'm gonna try to throw on iCam right here on the MacBook,
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:53.720]  and see if it'll let me take a picture of this
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:57.280]  while we're doing iTunes and GarageBand all at once.
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:08:58.140]  I'm gonna get a picture of this.
[03:08:58.140 --> 03:09:00.260]  Just stroke that eye-peen a little bit more.
[03:09:00.260 --> 03:09:01.100]  Yeah.
[03:09:01.100 --> 03:09:02.860]  All right, that's a dab.
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:03.700]  No, it's not.
[03:09:06.700 --> 03:09:09.260]  Am I doing a video, or am I doing a freaking,
[03:09:09.260 --> 03:09:10.700]  I just wanna do a photo, not a video.
[03:09:10.700 --> 03:09:11.540]  Here we go.
[03:09:12.500 --> 03:09:15.180]  That's a mosquito container.
[03:09:17.060 --> 03:09:19.060]  A mosquito container, like I'm John Hammond?
[03:09:19.060 --> 03:09:19.900]  Yeah, totally.
[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:20.740]  I'll put that picture up on.
[03:09:20.740 --> 03:09:21.820]  Hey, have you ever seen that?
[03:09:21.820 --> 03:09:24.140]  The holy shit, it's a dinosaur?
[03:09:24.140 --> 03:09:25.260]  Like, huh.
[03:09:25.260 --> 03:09:26.100]  The remake?
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:27.280]  I'll show you after this.
[03:09:27.280 --> 03:09:28.440]  Yeah, it's good.
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:29.280]  It's on YouTube.
[03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:30.100]  It's good shit.
[03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:31.240]  If you guys don't know what I'm talking about,
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:32.080]  go check it out.
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:34.600]  Just type in, oh my God, it's a dinosaur.
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:37.960]  But yeah, it's good.
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:40.880]  It'll make you sing it for the next week and a half.
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:42.040]  I can promise you that.
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:43.480]  It's one of those things that gets stuck in your head.
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:45.440]  My daughter showed me It's Raining Tacos,
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:47.200]  and I fucking walked around singing,
[03:09:47.200 --> 03:09:50.040]  it's raining tacos for like a week.
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:53.840]  Yeah, it's rough, man.
[03:09:54.460 --> 03:09:57.860]  My son brought home, I already knew what it was
[03:09:57.860 --> 03:09:59.620]  because I'm on the internet all the time,
[03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:02.300]  but my son brought home, wish me luck with this, Dad.
[03:10:02.300 --> 03:10:03.500]  Good luck.
[03:10:03.500 --> 03:10:05.900]  What does the fox say to my wife?
[03:10:05.900 --> 03:10:08.020]  And she just thought,
[03:10:08.020 --> 03:10:10.220]  why the hell is he watching this at daycare?
[03:10:12.140 --> 03:10:14.100]  Why does he know about this and I don't?
[03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:17.500]  You know what, it's stupid, but why is he watching it?
[03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:19.060]  So, wow.
[03:10:20.140 --> 03:10:20.980]  That was brutal.
[03:10:20.980 --> 03:10:21.800]  That was a brutal dad.
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:23.580]  My daughter introduced me to What Does the Fox Say
[03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:25.160]  to my wife.
[03:10:25.160 --> 03:10:26.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:26.820]  I didn't understand it.
[03:10:26.820 --> 03:10:28.200]  Is that where it's got a popularity from?
[03:10:28.200 --> 03:10:32.120]  Like from the age of six to 13?
[03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:34.600]  Is that what, unless your name is Katrina.
