[00:00.190 --> 00:34.680]  All right, here we go.
[00:34.680 --> 00:36.240]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:36.240 --> 00:37.240]  I'm your host.
[00:37.240 --> 00:38.520]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:38.520 --> 00:44.000]  This is episode 729 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.320]  In this episode, Clint is going to join me and we're going to recap the secret stash
[00:48.320 --> 00:50.240]  event that happened this weekend.
[00:50.240 --> 00:53.800]  Before we get to that part, let me do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who
[00:53.800 --> 00:57.000]  continue to support the show on Patreon.

[01:26.520 --> 01:28.920]  to our friend Godfather Kush.

[01:37.120 --> 01:43.120]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:43.120 --> 01:46.240]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include

[01:51.000 --> 01:52.000]  of my friends.
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.000]  All right.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.520]  In a second here I will bring Clint on but I do have some very sad news.
[01:56.520 --> 01:58.600]  I do want to be very clear when I say this.
[01:58.600 --> 02:02.380]  Unfortunately, we have lost another member of the Irie Army.
[02:02.380 --> 02:04.800]  Our friend Giant Mike has passed away.
[02:04.800 --> 02:07.560]  Let me be very clear that this is not White Mike.
[02:07.560 --> 02:10.460]  Giant Mike and White Mike are two different dudes.
[02:10.460 --> 02:12.120]  Giant Mike is a very tall skinny guy.
[02:12.120 --> 02:13.120]  He has passed away.
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.200]  I want to send him a fist bump, send him a sacred hug up to wherever Mike goes, wherever
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.960]  you believe in, whatever heaven you're into.
[02:18.960 --> 02:20.240]  That's where Giant Mike went to.
[02:20.240 --> 02:23.560]  I know that dude went to whatever incarnation of heaven you do believe in.
[02:23.560 --> 02:24.560]  That's where he is.
[02:24.560 --> 02:25.560]  He was a good dude.
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.840]  He was a giant tall gentle dude.
[02:26.840 --> 02:27.840]  He was a father.
[02:27.840 --> 02:28.840]  He was a husband.
[02:28.840 --> 02:29.840]  He was a friend.
[02:29.840 --> 02:30.840]  He was a grower.
[02:30.840 --> 02:33.760]  He was recently in trouble with the law for growing so you got to give him a fist bump
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.760]  and some love.
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.760]  Also, I don't know if she'll listen to this but big shout out to the Dabbing Queen, Mrs.
[02:39.760 --> 02:40.760]  Giant Mike.
[02:40.760 --> 02:42.240]  If you need anything, you reach out.
[02:42.240 --> 02:44.520]  The entire Irie Army has got your back.
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.160]  I'll make sure you don't go without anything.
[02:46.160 --> 02:47.160]  You've got kids.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.480]  You've got a family to take care of.
[02:48.480 --> 02:50.120]  Let me know if I can help you in any way.
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.120]  Please do not be shy.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.120]  Big shout out.
[02:52.120 --> 02:53.120]  Much love.
[02:53.120 --> 02:54.200]  Much respect to Giant Mike.
[02:54.200 --> 02:55.320]  Rest in peace, brother.
[02:55.320 --> 02:57.080]  Big hug to the Dabbing Queen.
[02:57.080 --> 02:58.080]  All right.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.080]  We do have Clint here on the show.
[02:59.080 --> 03:00.080]  Let's change the mood really quickly.
[03:00.080 --> 03:02.200]  I'm going to step over here to camera one.
[03:02.200 --> 03:04.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[03:04.120 --> 03:05.120]  Clint is here.
[03:05.120 --> 03:07.840]  I know that's hard to follow, bro, saying goodbye to a friend but dude, thank you for
[03:07.840 --> 03:08.840]  lightening the mood.
[03:08.840 --> 03:10.880]  The comedian, the lighthearted guy is here.
[03:10.880 --> 03:11.880]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[03:11.880 --> 03:12.880]  Hey, man.
[03:12.880 --> 03:13.880]  I'm super happy to be here.
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.440]  I am such a big fan of the podcast, a big fan of you, of course.
[03:18.440 --> 03:20.720]  We've been friends for almost a decade now.
[03:20.720 --> 03:21.720]  Not so long.
[03:21.720 --> 03:22.720]  You're telling them how old we are, bro.
[03:22.720 --> 03:23.720]  You know?
[03:23.720 --> 03:24.720]  And thank you for supporting the show.
[03:24.720 --> 03:27.400]  I don't expect all of my friends to listen to the show, especially you.
[03:27.400 --> 03:30.800]  You're not a serious hardcore weed grower.
[03:30.800 --> 03:32.180]  You're not deep into weed culture.
[03:33.160 --> 03:34.160]  I'm not deep into weed culture.
[03:34.160 --> 03:35.160]  That's correct.
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.540]  We'll talk more about that throughout the show.
[03:36.540 --> 03:39.460]  But you are getting your green thumb, your feet wet.
[03:39.460 --> 03:40.460]  And I love that you're listening.
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.460]  I don't expect that.
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.460]  And sometimes my friends apologize.
[03:42.460 --> 03:44.220]  Like, bro, I haven't heard the recent episode.
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.580]  And I'm like, dude, there's a lot in life.
[03:46.580 --> 03:47.980]  You're not getting paid.
[03:47.980 --> 03:48.980]  There's no test.
[03:48.980 --> 03:50.180]  Enjoy the show when you can.
[03:50.180 --> 03:51.180]  It's free.
[03:51.180 --> 03:52.180]  I want you to enjoy it, learn from it.
[03:52.180 --> 03:53.540]  But I appreciate that you're listening, bro.
[03:53.540 --> 03:54.540]  That's rad.
[03:54.540 --> 03:57.540]  I mean, 729 episodes.
[03:57.540 --> 03:58.540]  Yeah, buddy.
[03:58.540 --> 03:59.540]  Congratulations, man.
[03:59.540 --> 04:00.540]  Thank you, bro.
[04:00.900 --> 04:02.380]  It's been really great to see you crushing it.
[04:02.380 --> 04:03.380]  I appreciate that.
[04:03.380 --> 04:05.940]  I think the last time you were here was number five or 600.
[04:05.940 --> 04:07.180]  I know it was one of the double digits.
[04:07.180 --> 04:08.180]  I think I was on 500.
[04:08.180 --> 04:09.180]  It's been a long time.
[04:09.180 --> 04:10.180]  It was the last time.
[04:10.180 --> 04:11.740]  This was before video.
[04:11.740 --> 04:16.220]  So this is the first time that I've ever got to put a voice and a face together on your
[04:16.220 --> 04:17.220]  podcast.
[04:17.220 --> 04:18.540]  I was going to say that the beard is here.
[04:18.540 --> 04:21.620]  You brought the beard, the face looking all shiny, showing that beard off.
[04:21.620 --> 04:23.260]  I'll try to remember to zoom in when I edit.
[04:23.260 --> 04:24.260]  There you go.
[04:24.260 --> 04:25.260]  Check out that shiny beard he brought.
[04:25.260 --> 04:26.260]  Dude, welcome to the show.
[04:26.260 --> 04:28.100]  This is going to be a good time.
[04:28.100 --> 04:32.060]  The reason I wanted to bring Clint, not only is he beginning to grow a little bit, we'll
[04:32.060 --> 04:35.060]  talk more about that as the show progresses, that will come in naturally.
[04:35.060 --> 04:37.060]  He's been helping out, been doing some growing.
[04:37.060 --> 04:41.380]  He's become really enthusiastic, and I think that's the word, passionate about the cannabis
[04:41.380 --> 04:44.500]  plant, about the growing, also about helping with ivory genetics.
[04:44.500 --> 04:46.300]  Just being a bro, you've had my back.
[04:46.300 --> 04:48.340]  I've needed some help with some things.
[04:48.340 --> 04:51.600]  You've provided a lot of help and service and bro-ship, so that's cool.
[04:51.600 --> 04:56.220]  But the reason I brought him on today is we attended the secret stash, the groovy gravy
[04:56.700 --> 04:59.340]  secret stash seed exchange in Denver, Colorado.
[04:59.340 --> 05:00.340]  There we go.
[05:00.340 --> 05:01.340]  I got the sales pitch going.
[05:01.340 --> 05:02.340]  There you go.
[05:02.340 --> 05:03.340]  Excuse me, I got stuff in my teeth.
[05:03.340 --> 05:06.940]  I'm just going to keep talking here, keep recording right over it.
[05:06.940 --> 05:08.260]  We attended the event together.
[05:08.260 --> 05:09.580]  We also brought White Mike.
[05:09.580 --> 05:14.660]  I hosted the booth and I used Clint, I used you, as kind of security and bro-ship and
[05:14.660 --> 05:17.060]  backup ship and customer service.
[05:17.060 --> 05:18.980]  Mike plays a very good customer service role.
[05:18.980 --> 05:20.740]  They are learning the strains really well.
[05:20.740 --> 05:23.980]  They both know how to talk to people, so it's great to have them at the booth.
[05:23.980 --> 05:26.620]  I thought I'd bring them to do a recap of the event.
[05:26.620 --> 05:29.500]  If you've been following along, I've been talking about the event for a long time.
[05:29.500 --> 05:31.700]  It was a really cool event.
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.460]  Let's just jump right into talking about it, bro.
[05:33.460 --> 05:35.460]  It was at a super cool location.
[05:35.460 --> 05:37.100]  I don't know what that place was called.
[05:37.100 --> 05:39.020]  I don't know what that place is today.
[05:39.020 --> 05:43.300]  All I know is that on Saturday, they cleared everything out of there and we put up probably
[05:43.300 --> 05:49.780]  25 cool booths, a DJ and a drum set and threw a secret stash seed exchange in there.
[05:49.780 --> 05:53.940]  Super cool venue in the Rhino District of Denver.
[05:53.940 --> 05:58.860]  Secret stash was definitely an experience.
[05:58.860 --> 06:06.780]  First not knowing exactly where it was until the day of was kind of unique for me.
[06:06.780 --> 06:07.780]  I didn't know either.
[06:07.780 --> 06:08.780]  They didn't tell.
[06:08.780 --> 06:12.260]  Yeah, you would of course know, but they didn't tell anybody where the event was located until
[06:12.260 --> 06:13.820]  the day of the event.
[06:13.820 --> 06:15.720]  They would give you hints.
[06:15.720 --> 06:19.020]  First it was, it's in Denver and then it's going to be near downtown.
[06:19.260 --> 06:20.740]  It's at the Rhino District.
[06:20.740 --> 06:24.180]  Then the day of the event, they actually told us the exact address.
[06:24.180 --> 06:28.140]  The vendors got the address I think around 8.30 or 9 is when I got the text.
[06:28.140 --> 06:31.780]  I was walking the dogs and pulled up the phone and had it after that.
[06:31.780 --> 06:33.780]  There was a message saying, hey vendors, here it is.
[06:33.780 --> 06:35.980]  Then it said, do not share this address yet.
[06:35.980 --> 06:38.620]  We're not giving it to the other people until later.
[06:38.620 --> 06:39.620]  Most people didn't get it.
[06:39.620 --> 06:43.540]  The attendees didn't get it until 11 and it opened at noon.
[06:43.540 --> 06:47.380]  They made it really easy to set up because a lot of times I'll be walking into an event
[06:47.540 --> 06:49.980]  and everybody outside is Ross DeJeff, Ross DeJeff.
[06:49.980 --> 06:52.980]  I'm 6'5 with dreadlocks to my ass, wearing an iReed Genetics t-shirt.
[06:52.980 --> 06:53.980]  You can't miss me.
[06:53.980 --> 06:54.980]  Everyone's like, what's up bro?
[06:54.980 --> 06:55.980]  I got the dunks on.
[06:55.980 --> 06:56.980]  They all know that's me.
[06:56.980 --> 06:58.540]  Everybody wants to talk at this event.
[06:58.540 --> 06:59.540]  I grabbed my stuff.
[06:59.540 --> 07:00.540]  I parked.
[07:00.540 --> 07:02.420]  Parking was super easy because I got there early.
[07:02.420 --> 07:03.420]  None of the fans were there yet.
[07:03.420 --> 07:07.580]  The attendees got to park, carried my shit in, set up my booth and got ready before these
[07:07.580 --> 07:08.980]  guys even showed up.
[07:08.980 --> 07:10.940]  Luckily, I started my day in Broomfield.
[07:10.940 --> 07:12.900]  They had to drive all the way from Pueblo.
[07:12.900 --> 07:13.900]  I agree, dude.
[07:13.900 --> 07:16.020]  Not knowing where it is is a little nerve wracking.
[07:16.020 --> 07:17.100]  How do you know where to get a hotel?
[07:17.820 --> 07:18.820]  How do you know how to plan?
[07:18.820 --> 07:20.620]  You just got to fly by the seat of your pants.
[07:20.620 --> 07:25.100]  That's how being a weed grower and a seed seller has always been in my opinion.
[07:25.100 --> 07:32.300]  But it was a beautiful venue and so many good people and such a great vibe throughout the
[07:32.300 --> 07:34.100]  whole thing.
[07:34.100 --> 07:35.100]  Smelled great outside.
[07:35.100 --> 07:38.020]  They were cooking a lot of food.
[07:38.020 --> 07:41.620]  It was really nice inside.
[07:41.620 --> 07:44.900]  Very acclimate conditions.
[07:44.900 --> 07:46.520]  I just enjoyed.
[07:46.520 --> 07:52.000]  The whole experience, I got to meet so many fun people and so many passionate people about
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.800]  weed.
[07:54.800 --> 07:58.160]  It has reinvigorated my love for the plant.
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.760]  I appreciate that.
[07:59.760 --> 08:04.320]  This event was cool because, no offense to the bigger events, I'm not going to bash the
[08:04.320 --> 08:07.600]  Endo Expo that didn't happen, but that was one of the bigger events to compare it to.
[08:07.600 --> 08:08.920]  Rest in peace, Chris, by the way.
[08:08.920 --> 08:11.800]  Sorry the Endo did not happen, you guys.
[08:11.800 --> 08:16.440]  But at that event, you get people who have no idea what they're talking about about cannabis.
[08:17.360 --> 08:18.360]  You get everybody at that event.
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.880]  It's a big commercialized event.
[08:19.880 --> 08:24.400]  At the Secret Stash, it was the people that were there looking for specific genetics.
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.720]  They would come to the booth and they would be like, do you have this pack?
[08:27.720 --> 08:29.680]  I want this pack right now.
[08:29.680 --> 08:30.680]  Here's my money.
[08:30.680 --> 08:31.680]  I've been looking for this.
[08:31.680 --> 08:32.680]  You're here.
[08:32.680 --> 08:33.680]  I will take it now today.
[08:33.680 --> 08:35.680]  Then you can see them have a strategy.
[08:35.680 --> 08:39.560]  They would go from us and then right over to JJ and get that sour diesel and then run
[08:39.560 --> 08:42.480]  over to Masonic and get that Wilson papaya.
[08:42.480 --> 08:45.800]  They were getting everything they could from every breeder they wanted.
[08:46.160 --> 08:48.160]  One guy's like, would you recommend I shop with anybody else?
[08:48.160 --> 08:49.880]  I was like, definitely go see JJ.
[08:49.880 --> 08:50.880]  Go hit Masonic.
[08:50.880 --> 08:52.200]  He held up his bag.
[08:52.200 --> 08:55.560]  He had a Masonic bag with JJ seeds in it that I could see.
[08:55.560 --> 08:57.160]  I was like, you're already winning, bro.
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.520]  He's like, I listened to the show, dude.
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.160]  He had a strategy already.
[09:00.160 --> 09:01.160]  Perfect.
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.280]  Yeah, he knew exactly where he wanted to shop, who he wanted to see.
[09:04.280 --> 09:06.880]  I want to go backwards a little bit.
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.160]  Seed vendors inside, food trucks and art and culture outside.
[09:11.160 --> 09:12.160]  That was super cool.
[09:12.160 --> 09:13.160]  That's right.
[09:13.280 --> 09:19.280]  We had artists right in front of us doing their craft.
[09:19.280 --> 09:20.280]  That was really fun.
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.520]  I actually got to talk with a couple of the artists and tell them, hey man, it's really
[09:23.520 --> 09:27.760]  fun to watch you and your art.
[09:27.760 --> 09:30.080]  The canvas would go from blank to artwork.
[09:30.080 --> 09:31.840]  They would take down the art and put up another one.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.440]  Then I was like, what are they drawing?
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.440]  Who is that?
[09:34.440 --> 09:37.000]  Then suddenly the guy that they had painted walked by and they had him hold up the painting.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.280]  I was like, that's pretty cool, man.
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.080]  That's that guy for sure.
[09:41.080 --> 09:42.680]  Just a wonderful event.
[09:43.200 --> 09:44.600]  Roovy Gravy, excellent job.
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:45.600 --> 09:46.600]  Really great job.
[09:46.600 --> 09:47.600]  Good job, bro.
[09:47.600 --> 09:48.600]  We'll be there next year.
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.600]  Absolutely.
[09:49.600 --> 09:50.600]  Everybody plan ahead about this time next year.
[09:50.600 --> 09:51.600]  That'll be the third one next year.
[09:51.600 --> 09:53.160]  That'll be bigger, better, badder.
[09:53.160 --> 09:54.600]  I will prepare better.
[09:54.600 --> 09:57.960]  We had the menu on a QR code because I didn't want to waste paper.
[09:57.960 --> 10:00.600]  I never know how many menus to print out.
[10:00.600 --> 10:02.720]  I don't like throwing them away after the event.
[10:02.720 --> 10:03.720]  I made a QR code.
[10:03.720 --> 10:04.720]  You scan it with your phone.
[10:04.720 --> 10:09.480]  I feel like that may have costed us a few sales, but that's a learning experience.
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.040]  In Denver, it seems like everything is QR code.
[10:13.040 --> 10:19.600]  It's tough for us to be down on ourselves for something that seems like a very-
[10:19.600 --> 10:20.600]  Trendy?
[10:20.600 --> 10:21.600]  Common?
[10:21.600 --> 10:23.480]  People should have been ready for it.
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.480]  The people that weren't, it seemed like, well, I don't know.
[10:26.480 --> 10:28.360]  Yeah, we probably could have had a couple of menus.
[10:28.360 --> 10:31.640]  They were definitely from somewhere smaller is the polite way to say it.
[10:31.640 --> 10:32.640]  They weren't familiar with that.
[10:32.640 --> 10:33.640]  Welcome to Colorado.
[10:33.640 --> 10:34.640]  Welcome to Denver.
[10:34.640 --> 10:35.880]  Man, such a good time though.
[10:35.880 --> 10:38.200]  Such positive energy flowing through that place.
[10:38.240 --> 10:40.160]  I was in such a good mood.
[10:40.160 --> 10:43.160]  A lot of the times at these events, you get hungry or something.
[10:43.160 --> 10:45.120]  Halfway through the day, you get the munchies because you're there.
[10:45.120 --> 10:46.840]  I was there early, 11-ish.
[10:46.840 --> 10:49.520]  That's not early, but I had to get up and get there and get set up.
[10:49.520 --> 10:50.520]  I got hungry.
[10:50.520 --> 10:54.120]  I may have allegedly been ... There was a no smoking event, but I may allegedly have
[10:54.120 --> 10:55.480]  had a couple of dabs.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.480]  I got the munchies.
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.600]  All I had to do was walk out the back door and there were tacos.
[11:00.600 --> 11:02.640]  There were vegan tacos, which is freaking awesome.
[11:02.640 --> 11:04.200]  There was cheesecake.
[11:04.200 --> 11:06.480]  There was all kinds of ... I smelled all kinds of foods.
[11:06.480 --> 11:07.480]  Everything you could think of.
[11:07.480 --> 11:09.120]  There was a food truck, a booth that had it.
[11:09.120 --> 11:10.200]  There was a massage booth.
[11:10.200 --> 11:12.440]  Big shout out to Priscilla and the massage booth.
[11:12.440 --> 11:14.000]  A bunch of great stuff outside.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.800]  We got to watch Art Inside.
[11:15.800 --> 11:19.480]  Let's work on the list of the people that we should give a shout out to because we saw
[11:19.480 --> 11:20.480]  a bunch of cool people.
[11:20.480 --> 11:25.040]  I tried to make a list and a note as the day went on, but there were so many people and
[11:25.040 --> 11:27.960]  I was working with customers and friends.
[11:27.960 --> 11:28.960]  I was high.
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.280]  There's a lot going on.
[11:31.280 --> 11:38.960]  The event was a very timed event for the customers because they had an hour allotment to come
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.360]  in and shop through every vendor.
[11:43.360 --> 11:44.360]  Is that good?
[11:44.360 --> 11:45.360]  Is that bad?
[11:45.360 --> 11:46.900]  I don't know because it kept people moving.
[11:46.900 --> 11:53.320]  We had a lot of different customers, but there was five different ... It was like five events
[11:53.320 --> 11:54.320]  almost.
[11:54.320 --> 11:55.880]  Like, okay, everybody get out.
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.880]  Next.
[11:56.880 --> 11:57.880]  It was polite.
[11:57.880 --> 11:58.880]  Yeah.
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.440]  They knew when they bought tickets, they would get a one hour time slot to shop.
[12:02.440 --> 12:05.560]  This was done to follow COVID protocol.
[12:05.560 --> 12:09.800]  This was booked before the COVID restrictions were released.
[12:09.800 --> 12:12.800]  This was just to be safe and compliant, follow Denver's weird restrictions.
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.920]  I think next year we may be able to open it up and not do the phases.
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.660]  What they do, and also to limit capacity of the building and to not overwhelm the breeders
[12:20.660 --> 12:25.200]  and to follow COVID restrictions, like Clint said, they open the door at noon.
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.440]  They get to run through until 12 or at one and they kick you out at one.
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.520]  Then from one to 115, it was really nice because we got to regroup.
[12:33.520 --> 12:34.840]  We got to reorganize.
[12:34.840 --> 12:37.940]  When you're selling seeds that fast, your organization gets messy.
[12:37.940 --> 12:42.800]  We got to kind of take a drink, hit the vape pen a couple times, reorganize the seeds,
[12:42.800 --> 12:46.120]  restack the t-shirts, things like that.
[12:46.120 --> 12:47.120]  Go use the restroom.
[12:47.120 --> 12:48.120]  At other events, I don't get to pee.
[12:48.120 --> 12:51.360]  It was super nice to get to go pee once or twice during the event because I was drinking
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.360]  a lot of water because I was yelling over the DJ all day, which was kind of hard to
[12:55.360 --> 12:56.360]  do.
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.000]  We were having to speak up a little bit.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.720]  If you were at the event, the music was a little louder than we would have preferred.
[13:04.720 --> 13:08.520]  Mike was hoarse by about 2 o'clock.
[13:08.520 --> 13:09.520]  Mike doesn't have a voice still.
[13:09.520 --> 13:10.520]  His voice is still shot.
[13:10.520 --> 13:12.600]  If we didn't seem like we wanted to talk, we did.
[13:12.600 --> 13:14.140]  We just couldn't fucking hear you, bro.
[13:14.140 --> 13:15.140]  We apologize for that.
[13:15.140 --> 13:17.720]  If I leaned in like I was trying to kiss you, I was just trying to hear you, dude.
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.840]  I was just trying to hear a lot of people.
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.840]  I was leaning in.
[13:19.840 --> 13:20.840]  My hearing sucks.
[13:21.320 --> 13:23.920]  I've been playing the drums for 20 years and that DJ was killing it, but it was a little
[13:23.920 --> 13:26.520]  loud for me.
[13:26.520 --> 13:27.600]  We saw a lot of people there.
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.880]  There was a friend who ... Some people, I can't say their names.
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.360]  I just wrote down the guys from upstate New York because that way we don't snitch on anybody,
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.360]  get any people in trouble.
[13:36.360 --> 13:37.360]  Never once, bro.
[13:37.360 --> 13:38.760]  A big shout out to those people.
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.320]  Remember the group that is doing all the great work with the doctors?
[13:42.320 --> 13:43.320]  They didn't give us a card.
[13:43.320 --> 13:44.320]  I don't have their business card.
[13:44.320 --> 13:45.320]  I don't know their names.
[13:45.320 --> 13:47.280]  There were three or four of them.
[13:47.280 --> 13:48.280]  I think they're from Missouri.
[13:48.280 --> 13:49.280]  They're from Missouri.
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.280]  Shout out to those folks.
[13:50.760 --> 13:53.320]  I don't know your name, but I'm sure you're going to watch this because you've got a podcast
[13:53.320 --> 13:54.320]  ad.
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.120]  I had a good time with you funny people.
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.120]  Then let's cover some of the breeders.
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.320]  Dude, it's always fun to reconnect with Top Dog.
[14:00.320 --> 14:01.320]  JJ was there.
[14:01.320 --> 14:02.520]  Didn't spend a lot of time with him.
[14:02.520 --> 14:03.640]  Got to stop and shake his hand.
[14:03.640 --> 14:04.640]  That's pretty much all that matters.
[14:04.640 --> 14:07.000]  Got to say hi to JJ from Top Dog.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.760]  That's a good dude.
[14:08.760 --> 14:10.280]  I got to talk to Daz.
[14:10.280 --> 14:11.400]  We're going to talk more about that.
[14:11.400 --> 14:13.280]  I'm sure you guys saw the photos of Daz.
[14:13.280 --> 14:15.680]  Daz's booth was right next to us.
[14:15.680 --> 14:17.200]  Got to hang out with Masonic Smoker.
[14:17.200 --> 14:18.200]  Big up to Big Mace.
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.920]  Uno, what up, Mace?
[14:19.960 --> 14:22.960]  I wish I could have hung out with Mace and Daz both for a little bit longer.
[14:22.960 --> 14:24.480]  It was such a quick event.
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.320]  A lot of people flew in.
[14:26.320 --> 14:30.760]  And then after six or seven hours of talking and selling seeds or voices done, you just
[14:30.760 --> 14:31.920]  want to go smoke and eat food.
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.720]  So everybody was like, hey, good seeing you.
[14:33.720 --> 14:34.720]  High five, fist bump.
[14:34.720 --> 14:35.720]  We're out of here.
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.720]  We all just dipped right at six o'clock.
[14:36.720 --> 14:37.720]  It was over.
[14:37.720 --> 14:39.320]  Big shout out to Masonic Smoker.
[14:39.320 --> 14:41.760]  If you're not following Masonic, give him a follow.
[14:41.760 --> 14:43.040]  His Instagram will get shut down.
[14:43.040 --> 14:44.040]  Just follow the next one.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.640]  It's how he does it.
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.720]  I finally got to meet our friend Colin from Sacred Tree Organic Farms, him and his lovely
[14:50.720 --> 14:51.720]  partner.
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.840]  They were both very great people.
[14:53.840 --> 14:54.840]  Spent a few minutes with them.
[14:54.840 --> 14:55.840]  They bought a lot of gear.
[14:55.840 --> 14:57.440]  They got some free merchandise.
[14:57.440 --> 14:58.440]  What a bright entity.
[14:58.440 --> 14:59.440]  Yes.
[14:59.440 --> 15:00.440]  Both of them were great.
[15:00.440 --> 15:03.040]  Both of them were just so happy to...
[15:03.040 --> 15:04.040]  He took off to go to the ATM.
[15:04.040 --> 15:07.480]  And so I just politely made conversation with her and she was super cool.
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.080]  They're both very petite folks and they both got some t-shirts to wear because the smaller
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.280]  sizes don't sell well.
[15:12.280 --> 15:15.200]  So I was like, let's just bless our friends with these.
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.200]  That's the truth.
[15:17.200 --> 15:18.200]  Yes.
[15:18.200 --> 15:19.200]  There's a link to all the t-shirts.
[15:19.200 --> 15:22.680]  If you're watching this, this was a note for the end of the show, but Clint just gave me
[15:22.680 --> 15:23.960]  a good segue.
[15:23.960 --> 15:25.520]  This will come out.
[15:25.520 --> 15:30.000]  It won't be April 1st yet, but when April 1st comes, there will be a huge sale on the
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  merch store.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.160]  The t-shirts, stickers, hats, other things that are on there.
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.720]  There are beanies, there are rolling trays.
[15:35.720 --> 15:38.640]  Those things will all be at a deep discount on the website.
[15:38.640 --> 15:40.240]  Make sure you are supporting the Patreon.
[15:40.240 --> 15:43.720]  The higher level of Patreon you support, the more discount you will get.
[15:44.560 --> 15:46.560]  The MailChimp will get a lower level discount.
[15:46.560 --> 15:47.800]  The Discord will get a discount.
[15:47.800 --> 15:50.240]  Then of course the Patreons will get a deeper discount.
[15:50.240 --> 15:51.240]  I'll go higher and higher.
[15:51.240 --> 15:52.240]  I'll tier it out.
[15:52.240 --> 15:55.040]  Make sure you check that out in the month of April.
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.040]  Where were we?
[15:56.040 --> 15:57.040]  Gingerbread.
[15:57.040 --> 15:58.880]  Big shout out to our friend Gingerbread.
[15:58.880 --> 15:59.880]  Gingerbread made a promise.
[15:59.880 --> 16:01.880]  Been talking to Gingerbread for a while and they delivered.
[16:01.880 --> 16:02.880]  They brought me a gift.
[16:02.880 --> 16:04.760]  We shouldn't talk too much about it here.
[16:04.760 --> 16:05.760]  Cool gift.
[16:05.760 --> 16:07.760]  There will be some new flavors coming in the future.
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.120]  I want to give a big shout out to somebody who's been supporting the podcast for a long
[16:13.520 --> 16:16.080]  I'm not sure if you'll remember this person until I describe them.
[16:16.080 --> 16:19.640]  This person was named Reggae in my head.
[16:19.640 --> 16:23.440]  Very cool, super energetic, positive vibes.
[16:23.440 --> 16:25.680]  I made a friend that day, bro.
[16:25.680 --> 16:29.000]  I've had a Patreon supporter and a podcast friend for a long time.
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.200]  That day I made a friend.
[16:30.200 --> 16:31.480]  We shook hands.
[16:31.480 --> 16:32.480]  We hugged.
[16:32.480 --> 16:33.480]  We looked each other in the eyes.
[16:33.480 --> 16:35.080]  We had a true bromance.
[16:35.080 --> 16:37.360]  That guy will be our friend for the rest of our lives.
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.120]  If we need anything in Denver, bro, all we have to do is type in the words Reggae in
[16:42.120 --> 16:45.520]  my head on Instagram and send a message that says, bro, I need this.
[16:45.520 --> 16:46.520]  It will happen, dude.
[16:46.520 --> 16:47.520]  That guy has got our backs.
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.520]  I'm sure of it.
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.440]  One of the coolest, I already said these words, most positive, energetic, loving.
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.080]  The dude's got to be our age and he wouldn't stop dancing around.
[16:57.080 --> 17:00.920]  He had so much energy bouncing around, just jumping, smiling, high fiving.
[17:00.920 --> 17:04.320]  And he was on his way to go see a reggae concert at the end of the show.
[17:04.320 --> 17:06.080]  So big shout out to that guy, bro.
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.080]  It was an honor to meet you.
[17:07.080 --> 17:08.800]  It was an honor to actually share a moment.
[17:08.800 --> 17:10.200]  You came at just the right time.
[17:10.200 --> 17:12.840]  Sometimes the booth is real busy and I don't get to really connect with people.
[17:12.840 --> 17:16.920]  I try, but when there's a line and I get busy, I try to connect with everybody briefly and
[17:16.920 --> 17:17.920]  move you on.
[17:17.920 --> 17:19.640]  Reggae in my head, we got to hang out.
[17:19.640 --> 17:22.080]  It was a great time, bro.
[17:22.080 --> 17:23.320]  Thanks for repping the merch, sir.
[17:23.320 --> 17:24.320]  Yeah, dude.
[17:24.320 --> 17:26.280]  He showed up wearing a pink Irie Genetics t-shirt.
[17:26.280 --> 17:27.280]  That's great.
[17:27.280 --> 17:28.280]  Yeah.
[17:28.280 --> 17:29.280]  I saw the dude all the way from across the show.
[17:29.280 --> 17:31.000]  I was like, he's going to make a loop and he'll come to us.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  And he sure did.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.920]  That was something I was going to bring up was how many people would be walking past
[17:35.920 --> 17:40.840]  and see you, their eyes lit up and they just like, we got to get to him.
[17:40.840 --> 17:41.920]  That was, I love that.
[17:41.920 --> 17:43.520]  It was one of my favorite parts of it.
[17:43.520 --> 17:44.600]  Cause I was talking with Mike.
[17:44.600 --> 17:47.480]  I was like, Oh, somebody watch this guy.
[17:47.480 --> 17:48.480]  Watch this group.
[17:48.480 --> 17:49.480]  Watch, watch these people.
[17:49.480 --> 17:55.320]  Like they, they would see you and just light up and like, that's where I got to be.
[17:55.320 --> 17:58.240]  And so your community is solid.
[17:58.240 --> 17:59.240]  I love it.
[17:59.240 --> 18:00.240]  I appreciate that.
[18:00.240 --> 18:02.640]  Thank you for noticing and thank you to the crew, but we advertised heavily on here.
[18:02.640 --> 18:05.640]  So they knew to come and they knew, they knew what to look for.
[18:06.360 --> 18:08.040]  And again, if we would have had that menu printed on the table, they would have gotten
[18:08.040 --> 18:09.040]  more seeds from us.
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.040]  There was a lot of stuff you guys missed.
[18:10.040 --> 18:11.400]  I feel like we fucked up.
[18:11.400 --> 18:12.400]  I apologize.
[18:12.400 --> 18:13.400]  We're growing.
[18:13.400 --> 18:16.200]  We learned, we learned a lot.
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.280]  One of my favorite things about this event, this was our first time out since the restrictions.
[18:20.280 --> 18:23.200]  Like my first time out at an event where we could actually connect with people and feel
[18:23.200 --> 18:24.200]  like we're having a good time.
[18:24.200 --> 18:29.960]  I got to see some old friends, Josh from La Plata labs, the guy that gave us the tremendous
[18:29.960 --> 18:31.440]  gifts, man.
[18:31.440 --> 18:32.920]  I am.
[18:32.920 --> 18:34.520]  I liked that guy a lot.
[18:34.520 --> 18:36.400]  That was the first time I got to meet him.
[18:36.400 --> 18:43.080]  What a, what a positive, bright, just the vibes, the whole, everyone that came up to
[18:43.080 --> 18:50.160]  the booth had great intentions, but there's just those people that you realize like, man,
[18:50.160 --> 18:53.200]  I need more of that energy in my life.
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.200]  Yeah.
[18:54.200 --> 18:56.640]  If we had time that night, we would have gone and hung out with Josh and gone to whatever
[18:56.640 --> 18:58.000]  party he was going to.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  That's where we would have ended up.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  That guy's a cool dude.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.080]  Make sure you check out La Plata labs, La Plata seeds, that Durango OG is the fire.
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.160]  Good friend of mine.
[19:06.160 --> 19:07.160]  Really good dude.
[19:07.160 --> 19:08.160]  What up Josh?
[19:08.160 --> 19:09.160]  Hope you're well brother.
[19:09.160 --> 19:10.160]  Good to see you.
[19:10.160 --> 19:11.160]  Good to reconnect.
[19:11.160 --> 19:12.160]  The dude's got some big plans.
[19:12.160 --> 19:13.160]  I was like, what's up?
[19:13.160 --> 19:14.160]  And he's like, I'm getting the fuck out of this country.
[19:14.160 --> 19:15.160]  I just smiled.
[19:15.160 --> 19:16.160]  He's always been that way.
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.600]  I hope you didn't hear that kombucha in the voice.
[19:18.600 --> 19:19.600]  There it is again.
[19:19.600 --> 19:20.600]  Shout out to kombucha.
[19:20.600 --> 19:21.600]  It'll stop eventually.
[19:21.600 --> 19:23.600]  We may not even edit that part because Clint's laughing at the kombucha burps.
[19:23.600 --> 19:24.600]  I'm in man.
[19:24.600 --> 19:25.600]  I don't, you know, we're here.
[19:25.600 --> 19:26.600]  We're here to have it.
[19:26.600 --> 19:28.800]  I'm, I'm so happy to be on the podcast.
[19:28.800 --> 19:34.120]  I'm so happy to connect with your audience because it's, I I'm on the discord as tall
[19:34.120 --> 19:35.120]  Clint.
[19:35.120 --> 19:38.280]  So, uh, when you guys see that, just know like, I'm, I'm here with you.
[19:38.280 --> 19:45.880]  I love this community and, um, it's, it's been such a great thing in my life to, to
[19:45.880 --> 19:53.800]  have people like, like Jeff around the positivity that, that I try to bring and that I received
[19:53.800 --> 20:00.520]  from Jeff is a, is a big thing in my life and it's a big positive in my life.
[20:00.520 --> 20:01.720]  I appreciate that, bro.
[20:01.720 --> 20:04.880]  Uh, my friend Cliff Ravenscraft taught me and he learned it from Michael Hyatt.
[20:04.880 --> 20:06.520]  See, it's always important to reveal your sources.
[20:06.520 --> 20:07.520]  I'm no wizard.
[20:07.520 --> 20:11.760]  Uh, Cliff Ravenscraft taught me that you become the sum of the five people which you surround
[20:11.760 --> 20:13.200]  yourself with the most.
[20:13.200 --> 20:18.960]  Uh, you, Mike, my girlfriend, and probably, uh, accidentally my mom is one of those people
[20:18.960 --> 20:20.840]  because I like to hang out with mama.
[20:20.840 --> 20:22.040]  She's, you know, she ain't going to be there forever.
[20:22.040 --> 20:23.880]  Try to invest as much time as I can with her.
[20:23.880 --> 20:25.400]  Now, your mom's a great person.
[20:25.400 --> 20:26.520]  She's my favorite person.
[20:26.520 --> 20:29.680]  I tell my girlfriend, she's my favorite person, but mama, you, you win.
[20:29.680 --> 20:32.480]  And babe, when you hear this, that's how it goes.
[20:32.480 --> 20:35.880]  Um, you, Mike, my mom, my girl, and there's one other person I'm not sure.
[20:35.880 --> 20:36.880]  Probably rotates.
[20:36.880 --> 20:37.880]  You know what I mean?
[20:37.880 --> 20:38.880]  I probably rotate that fifth person out.
[20:38.880 --> 20:42.040]  It's the discord crew collectively is who that fifth person would be.
[20:42.040 --> 20:43.800]  Uh, but bro, you're one of the five people.
[20:43.800 --> 20:46.360]  I don't surround myself with shitheads because then you become a shithead.
[20:46.360 --> 20:50.280]  Uh, if you surround yourself with five CEOs, five millionaires, you'll figure out how to
[20:50.280 --> 20:51.640]  be the CEO and the millionaire.
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.840]  Surround yourself with five positive, bad motherfuckers.
[20:54.840 --> 20:56.440]  You'll be, you'll be a positive, bad motherfucker.
[20:56.440 --> 20:59.040]  Hey man, that's all we try to be is just positive.
[20:59.040 --> 21:03.720]  And I'm hoping that we're spreading that especially to you guys and that you guys will take that
[21:03.720 --> 21:05.400]  and try to be positive.
[21:05.400 --> 21:10.160]  Even if it's just today, I can testify that the comments already on the previous videos,
[21:10.160 --> 21:11.400]  they feel the positivity.
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.400]  They feel the love.
[21:12.400 --> 21:13.400]  That's what they mentioned the most.
[21:13.400 --> 21:15.880]  That's one of the things they talk about is the positivity and the love.
[21:15.880 --> 21:17.000]  So we're getting it, bro.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  We're sending it.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  I'm going to continue with these shout outs, or this is going to end up being a 45 minute
[21:21.040 --> 21:22.040]  show.
[21:22.040 --> 21:23.040]  Jaren, Jaren, you bad motherfucker.
[21:23.040 --> 21:25.720]  I got to run into Jaren from new millennium.
[21:25.720 --> 21:30.920]  Those guys were passing out boxes of nutrients with random prizes and all of the boxes.
[21:30.920 --> 21:32.720]  There was so much cool shit in there.
[21:32.720 --> 21:35.400]  Some of it I can't mention, so we'll move forward.
[21:35.400 --> 21:36.400]  Big up to Oni.
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.480]  Oni seeds was there.
[21:37.480 --> 21:39.360]  Big shout out to Kim Blackburn photography.
[21:39.360 --> 21:40.840]  We've been trying to link up for a long time.
[21:40.840 --> 21:42.080]  Brought me a great gift.
[21:42.080 --> 21:47.160]  A special big hug to a good friend, my friend, Katie Ann Peterson.
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.240]  She came out of nowhere.
[21:48.240 --> 21:49.240]  I don't know where she came from.
[21:49.240 --> 21:50.240]  I just saw her randomly.
[21:50.480 --> 21:51.640]  She was like right about there suddenly.
[21:51.640 --> 21:54.680]  I just threw my arms up like, you better come give me a hug.
[21:54.680 --> 21:57.800]  Before I could finish the words give me a hug in my brain, she threw her arms up.
[21:57.800 --> 21:59.720]  I was like, I have to go give Ross to Jeff a hug.
[21:59.720 --> 22:00.720]  Hell yeah.
[22:00.720 --> 22:01.800]  Katie's a great person.
[22:01.800 --> 22:02.800]  Just a good friend.
[22:02.800 --> 22:03.800]  We've been hanging out.
[22:03.800 --> 22:07.040]  We ran into each other probably at an Adam Dunn event years ago.
[22:07.040 --> 22:09.240]  She was working at the booth.
[22:09.240 --> 22:10.760]  What's the Adam Dunn's clothing line?
[22:10.760 --> 22:12.680]  I can't, the Hoodlamp, Hemp Hoodlamp.
[22:12.680 --> 22:15.040]  She was working at that booth and I met her there.
[22:15.040 --> 22:16.280]  She's been at all the events.
[22:16.280 --> 22:17.280]  Just a cool person.
[22:17.280 --> 22:18.280]  Big energy.
[22:18.280 --> 22:19.280]  Big shout out to her.
[22:19.320 --> 22:21.400]  Yeah, hope you're well.
[22:21.400 --> 22:23.840]  Also big shout out to Priscilla, the massage lady.
[22:23.840 --> 22:26.120]  Made friends with her when I was working with the Indo Expo.
[22:26.120 --> 22:27.600]  I know her from there.
[22:27.600 --> 22:30.120]  She's always been a great friend, a good connection in the industry.
[22:30.120 --> 22:31.480]  So I hope she's well.
[22:31.480 --> 22:33.200]  The massage lady, Van.
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.800]  Here's where it gets fun, dude.
[22:34.800 --> 22:35.800]  The cheesecake guy.
[22:35.800 --> 22:38.840]  Dude, did you see all those cheesecakes at the event, bro?
[22:38.840 --> 22:39.840]  I only had one.
[22:39.840 --> 22:40.840]  It was delicious.
[22:40.840 --> 22:41.960]  Those cheesecakes.
[22:41.960 --> 22:43.800]  Everybody in that place had a cheesecake.
[22:43.800 --> 22:45.440]  Everybody said they were the most amazing shit.
[22:45.440 --> 22:47.720]  So big shout out to Bubba's Cheesecakes.
[22:47.720 --> 22:48.720]  Super cool, dude.
[22:49.160 --> 22:52.880]  I think it's a couple, partner, team, whatever, business.
[22:52.880 --> 22:55.880]  There was a male and a female there, so I would assume, but you should not assume.
[22:55.880 --> 23:00.000]  I spoke with the dude that was making the cheesecakes and serving them out.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Super cool guy.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.800]  We got some plans in the future.
[23:02.800 --> 23:06.960]  Then, how about this bad motherfucker that's on my list?
[23:06.960 --> 23:09.000]  We're hanging out and I heard the voice.
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.280]  I heard the voice before I...
[23:10.280 --> 23:13.800]  I was doing something with another customer and I heard the voice and I looked up and
[23:13.800 --> 23:16.880]  I was like, that is Scotty motherfucking real.
[23:16.880 --> 23:17.880]  What's up, bro?
[23:18.040 --> 23:19.040]  It was fun.
[23:19.040 --> 23:20.040]  It was fun to run into Scotty.
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.760]  We took a couple of selfies together, I think.
[23:21.760 --> 23:28.720]  For him to come over and just be as gracious with his time as he is, he's such a...
[23:28.720 --> 23:32.600]  I keep saying the positive light, but that's all I see out of this community.
[23:32.600 --> 23:34.800]  So just his smile is contagious.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.440]  Yeah, he's such a cool dude.
[23:36.440 --> 23:37.800]  He brings a different energy.
[23:37.800 --> 23:38.800]  He definitely does.
[23:38.800 --> 23:39.800]  And it's always positive.
[23:39.800 --> 23:40.800]  Nothing...
[23:40.800 --> 23:41.960]  It's recharging energy.
[23:41.960 --> 23:42.960]  That's so fucking funny.
[23:42.960 --> 23:46.240]  Also, I want to give a big shout out to a friend.
[23:46.240 --> 23:47.800]  I haven't seen this person in a long time.
[23:48.720 --> 23:50.160]  I heard that possibly they could show up.
[23:50.160 --> 23:51.720]  I didn't know that they would be there when they showed up.
[23:51.720 --> 23:53.520]  I got a big smile on my face.
[23:53.520 --> 23:57.400]  I am super huge friends with Maddie from the Garden of Weedon.
[23:57.400 --> 23:59.120]  I haven't seen Maddie in a long time.
[23:59.120 --> 24:00.640]  The restrictions got us all weird.
[24:00.640 --> 24:01.900]  She works a lot.
[24:01.900 --> 24:03.880]  She lives kind of further away than she used to.
[24:03.880 --> 24:04.880]  We don't get to hang out.
[24:04.880 --> 24:07.480]  That's a really good friend of mine, a good smoke buddy, a good dab buddy.
[24:07.480 --> 24:09.040]  I love her dogs.
[24:09.040 --> 24:10.600]  She's a super cool friend.
[24:10.600 --> 24:13.400]  And I heard this voice and I looked up and I was like, I know that.
[24:13.400 --> 24:14.400]  And there she was.
[24:14.400 --> 24:15.840]  And she's like, Ross to Jeff, I miss you.
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.840]  And I just gave her a big hug.
[24:16.880 --> 24:17.440]  What's up, Maddie?
[24:17.440 --> 24:18.840]  I haven't seen you in so long.
[24:18.840 --> 24:21.600]  We got to talk about her dogs and growing weed and all the shit we used to talk about.
[24:21.600 --> 24:23.080]  It's a big shout out to Maddie.
[24:23.080 --> 24:24.600]  Missed her for a long time.
[24:24.600 --> 24:30.360]  Then Clint kind of covered this a moment ago, but I owe a big shout out to my friend Groovy Gravy.
[24:30.360 --> 24:31.880]  I call him Wolf.
[24:31.880 --> 24:33.200]  Bro, great event.
[24:33.200 --> 24:34.240]  Everything was great.
[24:34.240 --> 24:36.920]  I had one thing to voice my concern to you.
[24:36.920 --> 24:39.440]  Honestly, it was the music was too loud and my voice is harsh.
[24:39.440 --> 24:41.080]  Maybe I'm too fucking old.
[24:41.080 --> 24:44.160]  But other than the music being too loud, that event was perfect.
[24:44.160 --> 24:45.120]  Parking was great.
[24:45.120 --> 24:46.520]  Entry was great for the vendors.
[24:46.520 --> 24:48.600]  Entry was great for the attendees.
[24:48.600 --> 24:49.400]  Sales were good.
[24:49.400 --> 24:52.920]  The price of the booth was fair for the amount of money that we left with.
[24:52.920 --> 24:54.040]  The ratio there worked out.
[24:54.040 --> 24:56.440]  Paying the crew and paying for the booth worked out well.
[24:56.440 --> 24:59.480]  The location was gorgeous.
[24:59.480 --> 25:01.720]  Wolf and his staff were very attentive.
[25:01.720 --> 25:03.320]  When I, attentive, attentive.
[25:03.320 --> 25:05.000]  They paid a lot of attention to me when I got there.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.640]  They made sure that I got to my booth, had what I need, made sure I knew where everything was.
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.480]  They pointed out the bathroom, told me where the cheesecake was.
[25:11.480 --> 25:14.840]  Like, they covered all the bases right when I got there.
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.080]  Good communication all the way through from the minute he told me,
[25:18.080 --> 25:20.200]  the minute I paid to the day of the event.
[25:20.200 --> 25:21.400]  We talked every day.
[25:21.400 --> 25:25.280]  So, big up to my buddy Wolf and the Groovy Gravy crew for throwing.
[25:25.280 --> 25:26.720]  In my opinion, it was a perfect event.
[25:26.720 --> 25:28.520]  There could not have been, there was no hitch.
[25:28.520 --> 25:30.040]  It couldn't have gone any better.
[25:30.040 --> 25:31.400]  Super cool crowd.
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.320]  Oh, just a, and they were checking on us throughout the event?
[25:35.320 --> 25:35.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:35.840 --> 25:37.720]  Like, during the breaks, hey, are you guys doing okay?
[25:37.720 --> 25:40.720]  Just come by and give me the thumbs up or thumbs down because you didn't want to interrupt us.
[25:40.720 --> 25:43.520]  And I just give him a thumbs up and a nod like, fuck yeah, we're good, dude.
[25:43.560 --> 25:44.880]  We're like meeting people.
[25:44.880 --> 25:45.840]  I got a bottle of water.
[25:45.840 --> 25:46.360]  I'm stoned.
[25:46.360 --> 25:47.520]  Everything is cool.
[25:47.520 --> 25:50.280]  I do have to make sure to give this disclaimer.
[25:50.280 --> 25:54.040]  I apologize to anybody I may have not put on this list.
[25:54.040 --> 25:56.000]  This is a minimal time to show.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.520]  And we were blazed during the event.
[25:57.520 --> 26:00.160]  I wasn't spending the entire time taking notes.
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.240]  If you're a breeder, a consumer, a friend, a member of the Ivory Army, and I didn't mention you,
[26:04.240 --> 26:05.400]  here is your fist bump.
[26:05.400 --> 26:05.920]  Love you, bro.
[26:05.920 --> 26:06.760]  Thank you for being there.
[26:06.760 --> 26:07.560]  Thanks for the vibes.
[26:07.560 --> 26:08.240]  Thank you for the support.
[26:08.240 --> 26:10.200]  And I'm sorry I didn't write you down.
[26:10.200 --> 26:13.280]  You know how it goes, dude.
[26:13.280 --> 26:15.320]  We've got a couple of cool things we want to talk about now.
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.280]  We just did the BET Awards here and shouted out everybody in the community.
[26:19.280 --> 26:20.800]  Special thanks to Mike.
[26:20.800 --> 26:22.200]  Mike isn't here.
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.840]  Mike lost his voice being such a good customer service representative,
[26:26.840 --> 26:30.160]  telling people about the strains, the lines, the stuff.
[26:30.160 --> 26:31.480]  He lost his voice by 2 p.m.
[26:31.480 --> 26:33.840]  He still thugged it out the rest of the day.
[26:33.840 --> 26:34.440]  Shout out to Mike.
[26:34.440 --> 26:36.240]  Also shout out to Clint for being a badass.
[26:36.240 --> 26:37.400]  I call him security.
[26:37.400 --> 26:38.040]  He carries shit.
[26:38.040 --> 26:41.040]  He stands there and looks tough, but he's learning a lot on how to help people.
[26:41.040 --> 26:42.280]  That's not really Clint's forte.
[26:42.280 --> 26:46.760]  He's not the customer servicey sales rep guy, but we're getting him there.
[26:46.760 --> 26:48.680]  I'm working on these strains, man.
[26:48.680 --> 26:54.360]  You've got, there's so many intricacies in these strains that I am,
[26:54.360 --> 26:58.280]  that's why I say I'm happy to, I love growing weed,
[26:58.280 --> 27:01.240]  and I just don't know the nuances.
[27:01.240 --> 27:07.360]  So when people are asking questions, it's like, well, boy, golden go to daybreaker, right?
[27:07.360 --> 27:07.680]  Right.
[27:07.680 --> 27:08.040]  Yeah.
[27:08.040 --> 27:08.360]  Yeah.
[27:08.360 --> 27:09.880]  That's the answer most of the time.
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.560]  And half the time they just want to talk to me anyway, because I know,
[27:13.560 --> 27:16.440]  like I've been growing these plants for longer than I should admit.
[27:16.440 --> 27:18.720]  So I've got relationships with the golden goat plan,
[27:18.720 --> 27:21.360]  with the strawberry fields plan, with the tangy plan.
[27:21.360 --> 27:22.800]  I know those, the P91.
[27:22.800 --> 27:23.200]  I know them.
[27:23.200 --> 27:26.320]  I've grown them so many times that I know what they're going to do.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.200]  Like if you cuss at it, I know how it's going to react.
[27:28.200 --> 27:31.360]  If you feed it straight urea, I might know how it's going to react.
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.400]  Like I know what they're going to do because I messed with them so much,
[27:33.400 --> 27:36.880]  and I've got so much data from my crowd that I know what they're going to do.
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.200]  So I can tell you about them so much.
[27:38.200 --> 27:39.520]  It's like talking about my own kids.
[27:39.520 --> 27:45.120]  You do get a lot of data from your crowd.
[27:45.160 --> 27:45.520]  Yes.
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.520]  Like that is such an important part of your community that maybe they don't
[27:51.520 --> 27:56.600]  understand how, how much that helps in, in every way.
[27:56.720 --> 27:57.080]  Oh yeah.
[27:57.080 --> 28:00.640]  All the feedback they send, if they say this one smelled like blueberries or
[28:00.640 --> 28:05.360]  this one smelled like feet, I don't take just one person's word for it, but a lot
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.960]  of people will message me and then I start compiling a database like, uh,
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.680]  the convergence will say a lot of people say it smells like, uh, spicy fabric
[28:13.680 --> 28:16.720]  softener sheets or spicy dryer sheets or something like that.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.320]  And when I hear the word spicy multiple times, that's definitely an accurate
[28:20.320 --> 28:20.800]  description.
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.720]  If one guy says rotten mangoes, I won't include that.
[28:23.720 --> 28:27.320]  But if two or three people say smell like rotten mangoes, I will say there's a
[28:27.320 --> 28:29.280]  phenotype that could smell like rotten mangoes.
[28:29.280 --> 28:30.440]  You just got to include the data.
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.840]  But data is also in the weed community.
[28:32.840 --> 28:36.200]  You got to like exclude and be really filtery with data.
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.240]  That's why I love and hate the internet forums because people can type whatever
[28:39.240 --> 28:39.800]  they want.
[28:40.720 --> 28:41.040]  Yeah.
[28:41.280 --> 28:41.600]  Data.
[28:41.600 --> 28:42.640]  You guys, thank you for the data.
[28:42.640 --> 28:43.280]  I do love it.
[28:43.560 --> 28:44.560]  I want to give a big shout out.
[28:44.560 --> 28:45.640]  And I covered the crew.
[28:46.040 --> 28:47.560]  I covered the people we met there.
[28:47.880 --> 28:49.080]  Uh, here's where I want to go.
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.040]  You guys on a previous episode, I did read a message about making auto flower
[28:53.040 --> 28:53.400]  seeds.
[28:53.400 --> 28:55.360]  And I said that auto flowers are not for me.
[28:55.760 --> 28:57.160]  Uh, I have nothing against them.
[28:57.200 --> 28:58.160]  They're just not what I do.
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.320]  I do photo period plants.
[28:59.320 --> 29:01.680]  I've been breeding, developing my lines for a long time.
[29:01.680 --> 29:03.640]  I don't want to relearn how to breed autos.
[29:03.880 --> 29:05.160]  I do know a guy that does it.
[29:05.600 --> 29:06.560]  He calls himself Daz.
[29:06.560 --> 29:08.720]  He's got a little company called night owl seeds.
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.760]  I just happened to have a booth right next to our buddy Daz at the event.
[29:13.040 --> 29:15.640]  And he may have passed me a bag of some F ones.
[29:15.640 --> 29:16.880]  I can't tell you what they are right now.
[29:16.880 --> 29:19.480]  I don't know if I'm allowed to divulge those details.
[29:19.480 --> 29:21.640]  However, I was given a bag of seeds.
[29:21.840 --> 29:22.560]  They are labeled.
[29:23.120 --> 29:25.760]  Golden goat cross to something else.
[29:25.880 --> 29:28.960]  F one, these seeds will be photo periods.
[29:29.280 --> 29:30.480]  Um, I'm going to grow them.
[29:30.480 --> 29:32.040]  I'm going to find a keeper female.
[29:32.040 --> 29:35.960]  Then I may return that a female keeper to our friend Daz.
[29:36.320 --> 29:38.040]  My point is you guys demanded.
[29:38.040 --> 29:40.280]  There are auto flowers of some iri genetic stuff.
[29:40.280 --> 29:42.640]  I sent a clip of that video to our friend Daz.
[29:42.840 --> 29:44.000]  Daz has replied.
[29:44.440 --> 29:46.120]  There are auto flowers in the making.
[29:46.120 --> 29:51.800]  There will be some iri owl, some night iri, some night army, some iri owl,
[29:51.800 --> 29:55.560]  some night owl, iri genetics collabs coming up in the future.
[29:55.680 --> 29:56.280]  Stay tuned.
[29:56.280 --> 29:57.440]  It's going to take a long time.
[29:57.440 --> 30:00.680]  You guys, um, do not rush this project.
[30:00.680 --> 30:04.400]  Honestly, this could take at least a year and a half to get, we got to get to, at
[30:04.400 --> 30:08.880]  least I think in my understanding, we got to get to the F five or F six before we've
[30:08.880 --> 30:10.080]  got reliable autos.
[30:10.280 --> 30:14.640]  So that could take a year and a half, two years to get there, but you auto nerds,
[30:14.760 --> 30:15.560]  it is coming.
[30:15.760 --> 30:17.720]  Stay tuned.
[30:18.120 --> 30:20.040]  Something I really wanted to talk about at the event.
[30:20.720 --> 30:24.480]  Um, I saw a lot of breeders with different approaches to customer service.
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.880]  That's the polite way to say it.
[30:26.840 --> 30:30.560]  Don't let seed sellers intimidate you and try to take your money without giving you
[30:30.560 --> 30:33.840]  the product that you are satisfied with and the information you need to
[30:33.840 --> 30:35.720]  successfully grow that product.
[30:36.200 --> 30:39.520]  Um, I love talking about my seeds because I made them.
[30:39.720 --> 30:40.800]  I know the details.
[30:41.080 --> 30:43.000]  I know the minutiae.
[30:43.040 --> 30:43.760]  Is that the word?
[30:43.800 --> 30:45.600]  I think the nuances of each plant.
[30:45.840 --> 30:48.680]  I know the grandparents, I know the parents of the seeds I'm selling you.
[30:48.760 --> 30:49.000]  Yeah.
[30:49.040 --> 30:50.960]  I know the parents of those plants I'm selling you.
[30:50.960 --> 30:53.680]  I've probably researched their great grandparents and their great
[30:53.680 --> 30:55.080]  grandparents on both sides.
[30:55.440 --> 30:56.440]  I know what I'm giving you.
[30:56.440 --> 30:57.520]  I know what I'm offering.
[30:57.760 --> 30:59.480]  I'm really proud of what I've made.
[30:59.720 --> 31:02.520]  I'm not shy about it because it's like talking about my kids.
[31:02.520 --> 31:05.440]  I get to talk about little Jimmy's and soccer practice and fuck.
[31:05.440 --> 31:06.120]  I don't have a Jimmy.
[31:06.120 --> 31:08.440]  I'm just making shit up, but I can talk about, I do have a Jimmy,
[31:08.440 --> 31:09.400]  but not a kid named Jimmy.
[31:10.640 --> 31:11.720]  I might not even edit that.
[31:14.520 --> 31:14.920]  I like it.
[31:15.600 --> 31:16.280]  Live to drive.
[31:16.600 --> 31:19.080]  Uh, but, um, I really love talking about it.
[31:19.080 --> 31:22.760]  So if a seed seller, isn't excited to talk to you about his stuff,
[31:22.760 --> 31:23.920]  to tell you details about it.
[31:24.520 --> 31:25.600]  That makes me skeptical.
[31:25.600 --> 31:27.360]  That makes me, and I'm not calling anybody out.
[31:27.360 --> 31:28.320]  I'm not saying any names.
[31:28.360 --> 31:30.800]  I'm saying when you go to the booth, there should be info.
[31:30.800 --> 31:31.720]  There should be details.
[31:31.720 --> 31:32.840]  There should be conversation.
[31:33.160 --> 31:34.120]  There should be a smile.
[31:34.400 --> 31:37.880]  Uh, if a dude's got a bad look on his face, that bad look may be in his seeds.
[31:38.200 --> 31:40.400]  Uh, if he's got bad energy, that may be in the seeds.
[31:40.400 --> 31:43.240]  Also keep in mind, we've been standing there since 10 or 11 today
[31:43.240 --> 31:44.120]  and talk to a lot of people.
[31:44.120 --> 31:46.400]  So give us a grain of salt and also a bottle of water.
[31:46.400 --> 31:47.760]  If you got one, it may be a dab if you can.
[31:48.160 --> 31:51.320]  But, um, the sellers should have info.
[31:51.360 --> 31:52.880]  You should get all the details you need.
[31:52.880 --> 31:53.920]  They shouldn't bullshit you.
[31:53.920 --> 31:55.000]  You should feel comfortable.
[31:55.080 --> 31:56.080]  Shouldn't feel rushed.
[31:56.080 --> 31:58.680]  Shouldn't feel like you're bothering anybody by asking questions.
[31:59.040 --> 32:00.560]  Uh, get the info that you need.
[32:00.760 --> 32:02.200]  Don't let the sellers intimidate you.
[32:02.200 --> 32:03.360]  Don't let them just take your money.
[32:03.360 --> 32:04.560]  Don't let them rush you.
[32:05.560 --> 32:08.360]  Something that I, I taught, I've talked about this a couple of times.
[32:08.600 --> 32:09.880]  I'm proud of myself for doing this.
[32:09.880 --> 32:11.600]  And I've done this now at multiple events.
[32:11.920 --> 32:13.120]  People will approach my booth.
[32:13.120 --> 32:13.760]  I'm approachable.
[32:13.760 --> 32:14.400]  I'm talkable.
[32:14.440 --> 32:15.480]  Very, they, they like me.
[32:15.480 --> 32:16.520]  And they see the people around me.
[32:16.520 --> 32:17.120]  I'm giving hugs.
[32:17.120 --> 32:17.800]  I'm taking pictures.
[32:17.800 --> 32:18.480]  They want to talk to me.
[32:18.480 --> 32:18.720]  It's cool.
[32:18.720 --> 32:19.000]  I get it.
[32:19.000 --> 32:19.480]  I love it.
[32:20.000 --> 32:21.040]  Um, I invite that.
[32:21.040 --> 32:21.520]  Come say hi.
[32:21.520 --> 32:22.280]  Come say what's up.
[32:22.360 --> 32:25.080]  If you're at an event and you tell me later, I saw you and didn't say hi.
[32:25.240 --> 32:28.360]  Wanted to message you and let you know, bro, come high five me and fist bump me.
[32:28.360 --> 32:29.000]  I was there.
[32:29.160 --> 32:30.880]  So a couple of times this has happened at my booth.
[32:30.880 --> 32:34.040]  People have come up to me and they're like, Hey, do you have this cross?
[32:34.040 --> 32:38.240]  One time they were asking for roadkill skunk or something super skunky.
[32:38.560 --> 32:41.640]  And I don't, I didn't offer exactly what they were looking for.
[32:41.640 --> 32:43.520]  The guy had money folded up in his hand.
[32:43.760 --> 32:45.400]  Like he's like looking for the skunk.
[32:45.400 --> 32:45.720]  You got it.
[32:45.720 --> 32:46.280]  Here's my money.
[32:46.280 --> 32:47.280]  It was going to be that quick.
[32:47.520 --> 32:49.920]  I did not have what he was looking for that day.
[32:50.200 --> 32:53.400]  And I knew that my friend who had a booth right across the way was
[32:53.400 --> 32:55.080]  offering a very similar product.
[32:55.080 --> 32:58.240]  And I said, dude, I don't have that, but that booth right there is got it.
[32:58.240 --> 33:01.520]  Go over there and say, Hey, Ross to Jeff told me to come over here and ask you for
[33:01.520 --> 33:01.960]  this.
[33:02.160 --> 33:04.320]  You may not have it on the menu, but I know he's got it.
[33:04.320 --> 33:05.080]  Cause he's my friend.
[33:05.080 --> 33:06.480]  He gave me a pack of it earlier.
[33:06.640 --> 33:08.240]  He'd love to make your money off of it.
[33:08.360 --> 33:09.440]  Just, just ask him for it.
[33:09.440 --> 33:11.640]  And he went over there and he bought those seeds that he wanted.
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.160]  I could have taken his $300 for that pack of seeds and given him some seeds.
[33:16.680 --> 33:18.880]  But next year, when he needs seeds, he would have been like, man, that guy
[33:18.880 --> 33:20.840]  said this was skunk and it smells like strawberries.
[33:21.000 --> 33:21.800]  Fuck that guy.
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.840]  Now he's got two new friends.
[33:23.840 --> 33:24.400]  He's got me.
[33:24.400 --> 33:27.080]  He can rely on to say, I don't offer that, but that guy does.
[33:27.080 --> 33:28.840]  He made friends with me and the other breeder.
[33:29.080 --> 33:30.720]  And now the right guy's got the money.
[33:30.720 --> 33:32.120]  The right guy's got the right seeds.
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.760]  And maybe hopefully somebody will walk up and to another breeder and say, Hey, do
[33:35.760 --> 33:38.160]  you have something that smells like watermelons and strawberries and grows
[33:38.160 --> 33:39.480]  real tall and makes good hash?
[33:39.720 --> 33:42.840]  And they'll go, Oh, you should go get strawberry Starburst from Ross to Jeff.
[33:42.840 --> 33:43.720]  That's the one that you need.
[33:43.720 --> 33:45.320]  Hopefully the karma works that way.
[33:45.760 --> 33:48.960]  At this event, somebody asked me if I had sour diesel BX three.
[33:49.760 --> 33:51.000]  I just laughed and shook my head.
[33:51.280 --> 33:52.520]  I was like, go over there.
[33:52.640 --> 33:55.760]  That guy, that guy right there, he's got exactly that on the menu.
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.680]  It's $300 a pack, but it's right over there.
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.160]  Go get it.
[33:58.160 --> 33:59.200]  And he walked over there and he bought it.
[33:59.200 --> 34:00.640]  He's got exactly what he wants.
[34:01.040 --> 34:02.800]  I didn't sell him oranges.
[34:02.840 --> 34:03.240]  You know what I mean?
[34:03.240 --> 34:05.000]  He's going to grow and he's going to get sour diesel.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.120]  He's not going to grow and get fucking oranges and berries.
[34:07.120 --> 34:08.840]  Like my product probably would have given him.
[34:09.040 --> 34:09.960]  I feel good about that.
[34:09.960 --> 34:13.200]  So, uh, trust the breeders pick up the vibe.
[34:13.480 --> 34:17.400]  I kind of mentioned that, um, this is the way I describe it.
[34:17.800 --> 34:18.760]  We're like bands.
[34:18.760 --> 34:21.320]  It's like having a reggae band, a bluegrass band, a death metal
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.200]  band, a techno band, a fucking Norwegian fucking folk metal band
[34:25.200 --> 34:26.520]  all lined up next to each other.
[34:26.880 --> 34:28.080]  One of them will speak to you.
[34:28.080 --> 34:29.840]  One of them will definitely make you walk away.
[34:29.880 --> 34:31.240]  That's a lot of how the booths are.
[34:31.520 --> 34:32.800]  You'll get vibes from all of them.
[34:32.800 --> 34:34.360]  If you're into reggae, you'll come to my booth.
[34:34.360 --> 34:36.960]  If you're into Norwegian death metal, you'll go to that booth over there.
[34:37.320 --> 34:39.800]  Uh, if you're into mariachi music, you might go see my boy Mase.
[34:39.800 --> 34:40.560]  What up Mase?
[34:40.920 --> 34:43.040]  Uh, but you're going to find the vibe that you roll with and you're
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.080]  going to go there, find the one that works for you, get what you want.
[34:46.080 --> 34:48.560]  Trust your breeder, be able to contact them.
[34:48.880 --> 34:51.840]  Uh, maybe that's contradictory because I get 3000 emails a day
[34:51.840 --> 34:54.600]  and I don't answer them all, but be, try to be able to contact them.
[34:54.800 --> 34:57.120]  Have somebody that will answer questions that supports the community.
[34:57.120 --> 34:58.360]  Doesn't just suck up your money.
[34:58.800 --> 34:59.240]  All right.
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.760]  This part here, Clint, you ready to talk about this part on my notes?
[35:02.760 --> 35:06.080]  This is going to be the highlight, the encore of the show here.
[35:06.120 --> 35:06.600]  Yeah, dude.
[35:06.880 --> 35:08.360]  This is, this is my favorite part.
[35:08.400 --> 35:10.320]  Well, let's, uh, you want to tell me, you want me to tell him.
[35:10.320 --> 35:13.400]  So I got to help Jeff this last season.
[35:13.440 --> 35:15.600]  I do an outdoor grow in a greenhouse.
[35:15.680 --> 35:23.920]  And so, uh, I was able to help, uh, with the moon tower and, oh man,
[35:23.920 --> 35:25.320]  just, it rolls off my tongue.
[35:25.320 --> 35:25.880]  I love it.
[35:26.000 --> 35:26.640]  It's so fun.
[35:26.640 --> 35:28.000]  He said help with the moon tower.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.560]  Clint was standing in the room when King Solomon was shaken to spread the
[35:32.560 --> 35:36.800]  pollen onto the pre 98 Bubba Kush female in Clint's greenhouse.
[35:37.480 --> 35:38.960]  So Clint was more than involved.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.320]  Clint was fucking right there next to me as pollination was happening.
[35:42.600 --> 35:44.960]  Clint was just as involved in that greenhouse as I was.
[35:44.960 --> 35:47.360]  Clint made the moon tower seeds right alongside me.
[35:47.360 --> 35:49.320]  So I did the selection.
[35:49.320 --> 35:53.360]  I chose the plants to put in the room, but Clint was at that greenhouse as
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.200]  much, if not more than me doing the hard labor as work, uh, I was the,
[35:57.360 --> 35:58.680]  the manager, the guy in charge.
[35:58.680 --> 35:59.200]  I got dirty.
[35:59.200 --> 36:01.360]  I fucking got some sneakers dirty out there.
[36:01.360 --> 36:03.120]  Got a little bit of a sunburn in the greenhouse.
[36:03.480 --> 36:04.880]  Uh, got spiders on my legs.
[36:05.200 --> 36:08.120]  Uh, but dude, you, you did a lot of work and Clint was heavily involved
[36:08.120 --> 36:09.120]  in making the moon tower.
[36:09.120 --> 36:12.680]  So it was fun watching and a couple other strains out there also.
[36:13.360 --> 36:17.280]  It was really fun watching Clint sell seeds that he made.
[36:17.280 --> 36:20.240]  You could just see him like, ah, yeah, he couldn't see, he didn't feel
[36:20.240 --> 36:22.920]  comfortable telling people at the time, but I can see he's like, I made
[36:22.920 --> 36:26.040]  this moon tower pack nearby and I could just see him like proud and excited about.
[36:26.440 --> 36:31.120]  It was, it was every time I heard moon tower, I knew those came from me.
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.560]  I have a hand in this and it made me feel spectacular.
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.600]  It still does because now I know going forward, I'm going to see so many moon
[36:39.600 --> 36:47.000]  tower pictures on our discord and it's, it's just one of the, the small pieces
[36:47.160 --> 36:50.920]  of this industry that I get to be a part of and I loved it.
[36:51.040 --> 36:51.520]  It was.
[36:51.680 --> 36:56.560]  And so as, as the moon tower goes out and as more gets grown, I mean,
[36:57.240 --> 36:58.800]  it's a rise to Bubba Kush.
[36:58.840 --> 36:59.240]  Yeah.
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.600]  It's just, I'm so proud to have something to contribute to the community.
[37:07.800 --> 37:08.520]  You feel that guys?
[37:08.720 --> 37:09.400]  Uh, dude, thank you.
[37:09.400 --> 37:10.120]  You did a good job, man.
[37:10.120 --> 37:11.320]  It's a great, it's a great strain.
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.120]  The seeds made it, the plants didn't die.
[37:13.200 --> 37:13.440]  Yeah.
[37:13.520 --> 37:15.840]  Uh, look forward to doing it again next year.
[37:15.920 --> 37:16.480]  Oh man.
[37:16.920 --> 37:18.960]  I hope you guys are picking up your moon tower this year.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.320]  Uh, you know, outdoor grows are coming very soon.
[37:22.400 --> 37:28.880]  And this plant, I got to grow the Bubba Kush and I got to grow the arise and boy,
[37:28.880 --> 37:30.640]  what a great combination.
[37:30.640 --> 37:32.200]  The Bubba Kush looked amazing.
[37:32.200 --> 37:33.400]  Smells amazing.
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.440]  Uh, really all the plants that I got to deal with this year were amazing, but
[37:38.440 --> 37:40.280]  that Bubba Kush I'm super proud of.
[37:41.160 --> 37:41.960]  You did a good job, bro.
[37:41.960 --> 37:43.120]  And that Bubba Kush is awesome.
[37:43.120 --> 37:46.560]  People have forgotten about the Bubba Kush, that old gassy coffee, stinky,
[37:46.560 --> 37:48.920]  earthy smell people moved on to the candy.
[37:49.160 --> 37:51.920]  Uh, the, the fucking donut smells, the cake smells.
[37:52.120 --> 37:55.800]  I predict the Kush and the skunks will be back.
[37:56.200 --> 37:56.840]  A good job, bro.
[37:56.840 --> 37:58.120]  Good job on the breeding on the moon tower.
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.880]  It's fun watching you sell seeds that you made.
[38:00.280 --> 38:01.080]  It was fun, man.
[38:01.080 --> 38:01.960]  What a great event.
[38:02.080 --> 38:03.600]  Just everything about it.
[38:03.640 --> 38:05.760]  I'm having such a good time being part of this community.
[38:06.240 --> 38:07.760]  And it's fun watching you.
[38:08.200 --> 38:11.840]  Um, some people at the event knew who everybody was when Masonic walked by,
[38:11.840 --> 38:12.760]  their heads would blow up.
[38:12.760 --> 38:15.520]  When Oni walked by their head would come back together and re explode.
[38:15.760 --> 38:17.680]  JJ would walk by and they'd shit their pants.
[38:17.840 --> 38:20.640]  Like all the top Britain, not all, but a lot of the top breeders were there.
[38:20.800 --> 38:22.680]  Some of them were there just hanging out.
[38:22.680 --> 38:23.480]  Didn't even have a booth.
[38:23.520 --> 38:24.800]  I missed Duke diamond.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.200]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[38:26.200 --> 38:28.280]  I did not give Duke diamond a shout out yet.
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.040]  I should, uh, I need a Southern boy ass whipping for not mentioning my buddy.
[38:32.040 --> 38:32.560]  Duke diamond.
[38:32.560 --> 38:33.040]  What up, Duke?
[38:33.040 --> 38:33.440]  I love you, bro.
[38:33.440 --> 38:34.120]  I hope you're well.
[38:34.360 --> 38:35.400]  I got to hang out with Duke.
[38:35.400 --> 38:36.680]  I have to say hi to Duke diamond.
[38:36.840 --> 38:38.240]  Uh, freedom is great, brother.
[38:38.240 --> 38:39.200]  It's good to see you back.
[38:39.400 --> 38:42.320]  Uh, rocking the events, but there were a lot of vendors there or breeders
[38:42.320 --> 38:44.480]  there that weren't even vending, just hanging out for the party.
[38:44.720 --> 38:46.640]  Cause it was such a cool community event.
[38:46.880 --> 38:50.080]  It's fun watching Clint have no idea who a lot of these people are.
[38:50.200 --> 38:51.520]  I'm like, that's Duke diamond.
[38:51.520 --> 38:52.480]  And he's like, who?
[38:52.640 --> 38:54.920]  And I'm like, that guy made fucking dominion skunk, bro.
[38:54.920 --> 38:55.440]  Come on.
[38:55.720 --> 38:56.040]  Okay.
[38:56.080 --> 38:58.080]  He's like, why does that guy have a long line over there?
[38:58.080 --> 38:59.560]  And I'm like, Oh, you mean Capulator?
[38:59.760 --> 39:00.280]  Like that's right.
[39:02.040 --> 39:02.320]  Yeah.
[39:02.320 --> 39:05.000]  You mean cap the guy that wears a mask to every event when nobody knows what the
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.920]  fuck he looks like and he works by himself.
[39:07.160 --> 39:07.400]  Yeah.
[39:07.400 --> 39:08.400]  He was really kicking ass.
[39:08.440 --> 39:09.520]  I saw him over there in the corner.
[39:09.880 --> 39:12.640]  So big shout out to a Capulator, big shout out to Duke diamond, big shout out
[39:12.640 --> 39:13.920]  to all of the breeders that I missed.
[39:13.920 --> 39:15.560]  I know there are several that I missed.
[39:15.560 --> 39:16.840]  I'm trying to look down the rows.
[39:16.840 --> 39:18.360]  I'm like, ah, shit, who am I missing?
[39:18.720 --> 39:24.240]  And I was Mason Oni and then fucking, uh, clear water and then, uh, new millennium
[39:24.240 --> 39:28.160]  and then awesome and Daz and then, Oh, NBG, nothing but gas.
[39:28.160 --> 39:29.280]  What up T big shout out.
[39:29.440 --> 39:31.440]  All right, guys, I have to stop trying to do shout outs cause I'm just
[39:31.440 --> 39:32.480]  going to fucking forget somebody.
[39:32.480 --> 39:33.840]  I'm going to feel like a real piece of shit.
[39:34.040 --> 39:35.840]  If you were there, thank you for the love.
[39:35.840 --> 39:36.480]  Thank you for the support.
[39:36.480 --> 39:38.800]  If you came up to the booth, if you just wave from across the way, big
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.240]  shout out to Kurt, by the way, way across the way, a big shout out to everybody.
[39:42.400 --> 39:43.840]  Shout out to the crew for helping me out.
[39:44.080 --> 39:46.640]  A shout out to Zara for trying to make it for hyping me up.
[39:46.640 --> 39:47.440]  She couldn't make it that day.
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.120]  I wanted you guys to get to hang out, but she couldn't make it to the event.
[39:50.120 --> 39:52.680]  Next time she will be there showing some love, dude.
[39:52.680 --> 39:54.120]  We have been going for 40 minutes.
[39:54.120 --> 39:56.480]  I said, I wanted to knock out a 45 minute show.
[39:56.760 --> 39:58.400]  Um, I'd like to give you the opportunity.
[39:58.400 --> 40:00.520]  If you've got any more left to say, you've got a hot mic in front of
[40:00.520 --> 40:01.560]  you and you look fucking great.
[40:01.800 --> 40:04.040]  Uh, you want to tell the world anything that's on your mind?
[40:04.200 --> 40:06.360]  Uh, let's keep spreading positivity.
[40:06.440 --> 40:07.680]  Let's keep spreading love.
[40:07.760 --> 40:10.120]  Uh, very pro Ukraine.
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.760]  And, uh, just, I loved seeing everybody today.
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.240]  And I know that, uh, going forward like this, I'm, I'm so
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.040]  excited for this grow season.
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.480]  Like I said, I do an outdoor grow.
[40:23.480 --> 40:28.200]  So all of my stuff is just seasonal and I am so excited to do it again this year.
[40:28.200 --> 40:30.000]  This will be 10 years of me growing.
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.720]  And, uh, it's, you know, I don't, I don't know all the players in the
[40:35.720 --> 40:37.440]  game, but boy, I appreciate y'all.
[40:37.960 --> 40:39.720]  That's part of why I love hanging out with you.
[40:39.720 --> 40:40.440]  You kind of humble me.
[40:40.440 --> 40:43.400]  You balance me because, uh, I'm caught up in all the players
[40:43.400 --> 40:44.440]  in the game and all this stuff.
[40:44.440 --> 40:45.120]  And you just walk in.
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.320]  You're like, what the fuck work needs to be done, dude.
[40:47.640 --> 40:49.280]  And I'm like, Oh, hang up some shirts and do some stuff.
[40:49.280 --> 40:49.840]  And you're like, sure.
[40:49.840 --> 40:52.080]  And I get to go schmooze and be the rock star.
[40:52.280 --> 40:55.160]  Couldn't do the rock star life without the full band.
[40:55.160 --> 40:56.000]  You guys are the band.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.480]  Thank you for letting me be the lead singer.
[40:57.480 --> 40:58.440]  I'll let you be the lead singer.
[40:58.440 --> 40:59.120]  I'll play the bass.
[40:59.160 --> 40:59.640]  How's that?
[40:59.840 --> 41:01.240]  We'll let Mike do the guitar.
[41:01.320 --> 41:01.840]  We're set.
[41:02.120 --> 41:02.840]  Sounds good, bro.
[41:02.880 --> 41:03.400]  Sounds good.
[41:03.680 --> 41:03.960]  All right.
[41:04.160 --> 41:06.960]  Um, would you like any social media following?
[41:07.640 --> 41:15.840]  You know, I am at tall Clint on discord as well as Instagram and Twitter.
[41:16.640 --> 41:18.080]  Don't use them a whole bunch.
[41:18.080 --> 41:19.360]  You guys love you.
[41:19.480 --> 41:21.880]  I just not a big internet guy.
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.000]  If you want to see a picture of a big sweaty dude with the beard at the gym,
[41:25.600 --> 41:26.560]  Clint's the guy to follow.
[41:27.160 --> 41:28.080]  He is the guy, bro.
[41:28.080 --> 41:28.920]  Thank you for being here.
[41:29.080 --> 41:31.400]  Thank you for making this a fun ass episode without you.
[41:31.400 --> 41:34.480]  It would have just been me rambling about an event that, uh, wasn't, uh,
[41:34.520 --> 41:35.840]  worth rambling about by myself.
[41:35.840 --> 41:37.040]  So the company was great.
[41:37.080 --> 41:37.760]  I appreciate it.
[41:38.080 --> 41:39.120]  Thanks for having me on, man.
[41:39.160 --> 41:42.840]  I had a great time and, uh, I look forward to seeing your comments in the

[42:12.800 --> 42:14.600]  It's a good time having the two Mike set up.

[42:22.440 --> 42:24.400]  Maybe we can get you right there on Mike.
[42:24.400 --> 42:25.000]  Number two.
[42:25.200 --> 42:26.600]  I'm really bored with the zoom meetings.
[42:26.600 --> 42:27.360]  I'm kind of over it.

[42:36.640 --> 42:37.520]  I'm going to blow it all out.
[42:37.520 --> 42:39.920]  You guys, it's going to go on sale dirty, cheap, get it the fuck out of here
[42:39.920 --> 42:41.640]  so I can replenish, get new stuff.
[42:41.960 --> 42:44.080]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns,
