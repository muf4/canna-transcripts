[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Big thanks and big shoutout to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:06.000 --> 01:15.000]  If you're not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  Alright welcome to the very first show of 2021.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  I hope your year is off to a beautiful start.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Hope everything is going your way.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  I am going to start with some sad news and then we will move forward.
[01:35.000 --> 01:44.000]  Unfortunately if you are a hip hop fan, if you're a hip hop listener, a hip hop connoisseur, you lost a major influence, a major member of the hip hop community.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  Big shoutout to MF Doom.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Unfortunately MF Doom has passed away.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  You may say, Ross DeJeff why are you talking about a hip hop artist? We know hip hop is not your thing.
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  I actually grew quite fond of MF Doom.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  I ran a commercial cultivation facility.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  One of my favorite employees was a guy named Elijah.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  Shoutout bro I hope you're listening to this and I hope you're doing well.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  When you work in my cultivation facilities, if you were the first one to show up for work today, you get to pick the music.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  We have a big Bluetooth speaker.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  You get to link your phone up.
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  You choose the music we're listening to for the first half of the day.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  So if you're there first, that's kind of your incentive.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  A lot of times Elijah would show up for work first and Elijah would put on MF Doom.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  Over time I grew quite fond of MF Doom's sound.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  That smooth feel, very creative lyrics.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  It's got a really nice flow to it.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  The lyrics are not always about the same thing.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  A lot of times in hip hop I hear too much of the same words, the same story.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  MF Doom didn't do that to me.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  So I grew quite fond of MF Doom's flow and style and creativity.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  The beats, his mindset.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  I really enjoyed that.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  So I did notice that MF Doom was gone.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  MF Doom has left the building.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  Big shout out.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  Rest in peace MF Doom.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  All right, let's move forward.
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  In the last episode I did talk about cleaning up and preparing our grow room to set ourselves up for success in 2021.
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  Our good friend Mobius sent me a message and he said everybody should have a dry erase board in their grow.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  That is something I highly overlooked.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  I've got a dry erase board in my grow.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  I've got a dry erase wall in my cultivation facility.
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  I think you should have some sort of dry erase board and markers and some alcohol and a little rag so you can clean that up.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  That is an essential part of your grow.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  Put that dry erase board right against the door on one side of the door so you can access it easily.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Put it on the outside.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  That way if you get an idea and the lights are off you can run up to it, scribble that idea on the dry erase board.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  Then when you go in there the next day it's right there on the door.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  You get the idea.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  You know what needs to be done.
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  So add that dry erase board to your grow room to help set yourself up for success in 2021.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  Big shout out to my friend Mobius Grows for the great update and the great advice.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  Also thank you to everybody for the feedback and the input on the camera settings.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  Yes I am learning this new camera.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  A lot of people said that that last episode the settings were perfect.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  Don't change a thing.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  Thank you.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  I do appreciate that feedback and thank you for tolerating that episode where I was a little bit blue and purple.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  I'm learning man.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.000]  I'm learning.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  There's a lot to learn.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  You can watch me fiddle with these knobs.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  You can watch me reach over and do camera corrections.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  There's a lot going on here.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  Also the auto focus in the last episode was going crazy.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  I bumped something with my finger on the screen when I was setting up and the auto focus wasn't what it should be.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  So when I moved over here it would focus on the background.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  It was a little weird.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  I apologize.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  Like I said I'm learning.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  It's just me.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  I don't have a team of six people or anything helping me out.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  I find out about the mistakes when I post the show and you guys tell me.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  So thank you and please forgive me for all of my slight mistakes.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  The content feels good.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  It sounds good.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  Everything's coming together you guys.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  Be patient.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  We'll get it there and it's just a one man show.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  Once again it's just me.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Also I've been talking about a discord group.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  There is an iRegenetics discord group on discord.
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  I will include the link in the show notes and the video description so that you guys can join the discord group.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Thank you to everybody who has joined discord.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  Big shout out to our friends Graybeard.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Big shout out to Lemur Priest.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  Also a big shout out to Stabby McStabwood.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  You guys are doing a wonderful job over there on the discord.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  Also a big shout out to Purple Thumb.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Purple Thumb is now a moderator on the YouTube channel.
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  So if you come in talking those jokes Purple Thumb just may use the wrench and ban your silly ass for a little while.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  Because I am too nice to ban people to be quite honest with you.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  It doesn't bother me if you're a troll.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  I troll you right back.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  People in the group have gotten tired of it.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  I've given them the ban hammer.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  Where do we go from there?
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  I think it is time to jump into the Patreon questions.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  Let's not get me rambling.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Let's get right into these Patreon messages on today's episode.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  If you'd like to get your questions read via Patreon it's real easy.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Join us on Patreon.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  Send me a message on Patreon.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Let me know what kind of help you need.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  I will get right to it.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  The first Patreon question on today's episode comes from Caribou Heart Organics.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  And it goes just like this.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  It says, hey Ross DeJeff.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  I've been hearing rumors of people being able to tell male plants apart from the females.
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.000]  Yeah, that's a thing.
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.000]  Then it says, they can tell well before they even go into flower.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  Is there any truth to this?
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  Or does it get filed under the same category as unicorns, oryx, goblins, hobbits,
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  and people saying they can tell the difference between male and female seeds?
[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  If there's any truth there, I've got five beautiful Arise babies I'd like to try it out on.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to set me straight.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  I sincerely appreciate this from Caribou Heart Organics.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  All right, there's one part I want to touch on before we go too far.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  He said, or is it filed under the category of unicorns, oryx, basically fantasy shit.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  Like when people claim they can tell the difference between male and female seeds.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  I've seen people on the internet posting this chart that says if the seed is shaped this way, it's a male.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  If the seed is shaped this way, it's a female.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  If your seed has a volcano shape on one side or a cone on one side, it's a female or a male.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  You guys, that is complete bullshit.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  Don't fall for that. Don't buy into that.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  That is not real.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  Anybody with the amount of seeds that I've got can greatly prove that that is bullshit very quickly.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  I'll let you pick whichever seeds you want.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  You can roll them around on the table.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  You can label them male and female, and we'll plant them, and we'll check in a few weeks.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  They're not going to be what you think they are.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  You cannot identify a male or female seed by looking at the seed unless you know it's a feminized seed,
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  but that is just cheating anyway.
[07:26.000 --> 07:33.000]  I would still put feminized seeds in there just to fuck with the people who tell me that they can identify the sex of a seed by visually looking at the seed.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  That part is bullshit. Don't ever believe that, you guys.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  Now let's move on to the part of this question.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  Can you tell the sex of a plant before it goes into flower?
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  There are some telltale signs that I use to kind of predict my males and females,
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  but until you actually see pre-flower, there's no way to be 100% sure of what you've got.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  You can send in a lab test.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  We're in the future. It's 2021.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  We're able to get a little card, and you rub part of the leaf material on a card.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  You don't even need to send plant matter.
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  You just kind of smear one of the leaves, get the juices on this little card.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  You fold the card up. You write the plant number.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  You number that plant, plant A, card A.
[08:13.000 --> 08:14.000]  You mail it off to a lab.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  They will tell you if that plant is a male or female.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  That is science. That is definitely an option.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  We can definitely get our plants sex tested through science.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Another great way to kind of predict and anticipate which plants are males,
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  as a breeder, somebody who has grown a lot of seeds, somebody who is looking for male plants,
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  a lot of times the male plants in the population are the plants that take off a little bit taller and stretchier than the rest of the females.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  This is not always 100% accurate, but 99% of the time,
[08:44.000 --> 08:52.000]  if you plant 10 seeds and you've got 2 or 3 that are just towering above the rest, chances are those are going to be the male plants.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  People get so excited.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  They say, man, this one right here is growing super tall, super fast.
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  And I go, yeah, it's going to be a boy.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  And they get so mad at me when I tell them that.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  Then most of the time I am correct. It's a boy.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  That male plant wants to get above the females.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  The pollen falls down from the male plant.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  So he wants to get up above the girls so that when he pollinates,
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  the pollen falls down and rains onto the female flowers and they can receive the pollen.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  That is, in my theory, why the males tend to stretch a little bit more quickly than the girls.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  They also kind of go into flower a little bit earlier as well.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  So the only way we can really tell male and female plants apart from each other truly is by waiting to see what type of sex they display.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  Do they put out the balls? Do they put out, you guys call them hairs?
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  It's a really easy way to identify it.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Do you get little balls or do you get little hairs? That's the quickest way.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  We are going to see pre-flower.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  If your plant, I spit right under the microphone. I apologize if you saw that.
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  If your plant starts to get root bound in that pot, if it says, hey, I don't have much more space to grow.
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  I've got 60 more days to flower, so I better start flowering now.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  Or if your plant has been under too little light, it's not getting enough light.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  It may decide, hey, I'm not getting enough light. It's time to flower now.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  That's when you're going to see sex signs starting to show.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  You're not even in flower yet. You're getting pre-flower.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  Sometimes about 45 days into the vegetative stage, you can start to get hints of what those plants are.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  They will give you pre-flowers. They're not in flower.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  We're not getting calyxes. We're not getting male parts at all.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  But we're starting to see the development of those parts.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're kind of nearing the corner where they're going, hey, you could flower me if you wanted.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  So they start showing you their sex. That's usually based on pot size or an environmental stressor.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  Maybe they just need to get up-potted. Maybe they've been growing long enough.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  Some plants will just show you pre-flower just because that's what they choose to do.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  A lot of times you need to up-pot or put more light on there.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  But the main answer to this question is you can identify pre-flower.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  You can identify sex through pre-flower if you're experienced.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  But let those plants go. Make sure that they are males or females.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  Let them get into flower a few days before you cull the boys.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  Let them get into flower a few days before you were committed to thinking that that's a girl
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  and you put it into a trellis net or something.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Honestly, it comes with experience. It comes with time and learning the plants.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  But overall, yes, eventually you'll be able to tell the difference between males and females by pre-flower.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  But not in veg, not at the start, and definitely not from seed.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  All right. That was a lot of rambling. I hope I answered your question.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Big shout-out to my friend Caribou Heart Organics.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  I've seen you following me on Patreon for quite a while.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  And I'm honored to finally get one of your questions here on the air.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  All right. Let's keep moving. I do have a couple of great questions lined up.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  This one actually came from the Grow Question tab on the website.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  If you go to my website, iReedGenetics.com, there is a tab that says Grow Help.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  When you click on that tab, you will have to fill out a short questionnaire.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  It looks like there are about eight or nine questions on there.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  I'd ask what strain you're growing, where you're growing it, what kind of lights you're using,
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  are you in veg, are you in flower, what week are you in.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  Basic questions that will give me an idea of what's wrong with your plants.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  Because a lot of times people say, hey bro, my plants are yellow.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  And then I've got nine questions to ask you. This is skipping a step.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  You have to answer these questions before you can send me the question.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  That's where this question comes from.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  This one comes from our friend Michael.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  And Michael is growing special queen number one Femini seeds from Queen Royal Seeds.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  They're growing it indoors under LEDs.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  They are in flower. They're in week eight. They're growing in soil.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  See all this wonderful information we've got.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  We can build a picture on this grow in our minds.
[12:22.000 --> 12:30.000]  The last feed was Medi One 20 milliliters, CalMag 4 milliliters, Fish Shit 4 mils per gallon.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  What was the pH of your last feeding? It was 6.1.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  That's a little bit low, but that should work.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  What was the PPM or EC? They didn't have that info.
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  The daytime temps are 78, nighttime temps are 72, daytime humidity is 53, and nighttime is 50.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  The problem, this is where we get to the details.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  I use DJ Shorts 1113 light schedule for flowering.
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  Do you think my last week, my last 10 days, I could do 18-6 and still be helpful?
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  I love the podcast. I can't afford Patreon right now, but I do spread the word.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  Thank you for all you do.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Hey, Michael, thank you for the support.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  You do not have to support me on Patreon to be my friend, to get help from me.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  I do appreciate the Patreon support, and I put you at the top of the list,
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  but I do appreciate helping people. I like good questions like this.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  This is a great question to answer on the show.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  So thank you for the great question, and thank you for spreading the word.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  Now let's get you some answers.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Michael is using what is known as an 1113 light cycle.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  That idea came from DJ Short, is where I learned of that.
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  DJ Short feels that by running the lights on for 11 hours and off by 13 hours,
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  we get better phenotypical expression, and I do tend to agree with that.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  If I'm running brand new plants, I'm doing a pheno hunt, I want to see what the plants really do,
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  you may see more variation from an 1113 light cycle than you would a 1212.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  So if you're really looking for the details and phenotypes, that 1113 may be helpful.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  You'll see more colors, just more phenotypical expression,
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  and more variation amongst the population by running the 1113.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  Also, if you're flowering for 60 days, you just saved 60 hours worth of electricity.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  That's going to be helpful. There will be a benefit to that.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  That's over two days worth of lights off time that you just got.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  It's going to help your gear last longer. It's going to help your electrical bill be lower.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  But anyway, it's good for the plants is the main reason that I would do it.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  The question here is, I've been running the 1113 during flowering.
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  Should I do the 18-6 at the end of flowering? Will that still be helpful?
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  Now let's talk a little bit about the 18-6.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  A lot of people have heard me recently start talking about putting my plants on an 18-6 light cycle at the end of flower.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  That is 18 hours on and 6 hours off.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  A lot of people are already saying, what the fuck are you doing to my grow?
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  Think of this. The number one thing that gives our plants energy, that makes our plants grow, is light.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  Light is the number one energy source for our plants. That is what creates photosynthesis.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  We are at the end of flower. I recommend putting the plants on 18-6 for the last 10-ish days.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  You can go shorter. You can go longer. This is very strain dependent.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  Since you've been on an 1113, I may wait until the last 7 to 10 days to do this.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  What you can do, put that light timer back on 18-6.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  Your plants are now going to get 7 more hours.
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  They're going to get even more than that because you didn't go from 12-12. You went to 11.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  You're going to get 18. You're going to get 7 more hours of light time every day.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  7 more hours of photons. 7 more hours of that much energy pounded into the plants.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  They're going to get that much more growth.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  Now a lot of people will say, won't that make my plants go back into veg?
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  Eventually, yes. But we're doing this at the last 7 to 10, maybe the last 14 days.
[15:37.000 --> 15:44.000]  If you're familiar with the cut and you're running a 12-12, you can get away with 14 days of 18-6 at the end.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  But know your plants before you try to do this.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  Turn that light timer to 18-6 at the end of flower. The plants will get more light.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  They'll get more energy. They'll beef up. They'll get chunkier. They'll get beefier.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  The trichomes will ripen more quickly.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  You may notice that you planned on doing that for 10 days, but at the end of day 7, they may already be done.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  This is going to speed you up.
[16:05.000 --> 16:12.000]  So my answer is yes. I do think you can still do the 18-6 at the end of flower, even if you did the 11-13.
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  But only do it for 7 to 10 days because you're going to see a drastic difference.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  You're getting one more dark hour and you're cutting that out.
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  The plants are going to respawn to it more quickly because it's more of a drastic change.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  So I do think that it will be beneficial. I do think it will help you out.
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  I also think you need to pay close attention to these plants.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Anytime we're doing a new experiment, no matter who recommended it, if it was me, if it was Jorge Cervantes,
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  if it was Ed Rosenthal, if it was your buddy down the block, always keep in mind that it's an experiment.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  You have to pay close attention to the plants because the plants are going to tell you if they're starting to revege.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  The plants are going to tell you if they're freaking out.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  I don't know what cultivar you've got. I don't know the rest of your setup.
[16:51.000 --> 16:58.000]  I don't know all the details. I know that in my environment, in my conditions, with my experience, this works very well.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  Pay attention to the plants. The plants are going to be the boss in every situation.
[17:03.000 --> 17:11.000]  But I do think you will see benefits in using the 18-6 at the end of flower, even if you did use the 11-13 schedule on.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  So yes, overall my answer is do that shit.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, I do encourage you to check out that Grow Help tab on iRegenetics.com.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  I'll put a link to where that question came from. It made it really easy for me.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  A nice little guideline of what's going on in the room and then a simple question.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  It makes it really easy for me to answer.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  Big shout out to my buddy Michael for the great question. I hope I answered you well.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  I want to keep moving because I have got a nice flow going.
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  This one says, hey, Ross DeGeoff, I learned so much from your podcast. Thank you so much.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Hey, you're very welcome. Thank you for reaching out.
[17:42.000 --> 17:51.000]  It says, I was searching on YouTube for your podcast about flushing during flower with high PPM and high EC runoff.
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.000]  I'm currently in week three of flower. I'm growing in a cocoa pot number 20, and I always feed until I have 10% drain to waste.
[17:58.000 --> 18:05.000]  So they're getting plenty of runoff. I feed with 1,200 PPMs, but I tested my runoff at 2,500 PPMs.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  What do you recommend? Straight pH water until the PPM get very low and then feed full strength at the same time,
[18:12.000 --> 18:19.000]  or flush with a quarter strength nutrient until the PPM is lowered? Or do you have another way of doing this? Thank you.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  All right. So our friend is feeding their plants and they're getting a very high EC in the runoff,
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  which could be problematic, could be non-problematic.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  My very first question to our friend here was, are the plants upset?
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  The numbers don't matter if the plants aren't showing any signs of stress.
[18:37.000 --> 18:45.000]  If the plants are green and thriving and making big fat buds and smell like dank, who cares what the numbers on your EC chart says?
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  That is an arbitrary number. If the plants are happy, don't change a damn thing.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  So I made a little bit of a flow chart. I made one of those charts. It says, are the plants happy?
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  And if it says yes, when it says yes, or no, I actually said, are the plants upset? Because that's the way I worded this.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  So are the plants upset? We're going to go right over to the no chart. No, don't change a damn thing.
[19:05.000 --> 19:12.000]  If the plants aren't upset, if the plants aren't showing any signs of stress, if there's no reason to change anything, don't change anything.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  Leave it just like it is, because if you do change something, that's when you're going to cause a problem.
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.000]  So if it's coming out with a high number, but the plants are happy, who cares? Make the plants happy.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  If we see problems, that is when we can use those numbers to adjust things.
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  So are the plants upset? If the plants are upset, it may be time to rinse them and get all the excess salt out of that cocoa and start fresh.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  So what I would do if the plants are angry, only do this if you're seeing signs of stress in the plants.
[19:38.000 --> 19:44.000]  I keep repeating that, but I don't want to mess up a good thing. These plants could be totally healthy and you're just stressed over numbers,
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  and numbers don't matter if the plants are happy. We've got a lot of great gear.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  We've got monitors that tell us what's happening in every inch of the room.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  We can measure EC and PPMs and fucking temperature and all this magical shit.
[19:57.000 --> 20:03.000]  But are we paying attention to the plants? Who cares what all the monitors and numbers say if the plants look good?
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  Just make sure those plants are happy. We're not growing monitors. We're not growing runoff.
[20:07.000 --> 20:13.000]  We're growing cannabis plants. So if those plants do look upset, that is when I would flush.
[20:13.000 --> 20:21.000]  I would feed enzymes. I would feed a little bit of microbes, and then I would water until I had at least 10 to 20% runoff.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  I would aim for 20% runoff at this point because we want to push all that excess salt,
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  all that extra nutrient buildup right out of the bottom of the pot.
[20:29.000 --> 20:36.000]  I also wonder if you rinsed your cocoa before you used it. That could be contributing to the high EC and high PPMs.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  That could just be salt from salt water in your plants. You didn't rinse the cocoa.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  Those plants are going to start looking like shit real soon. You need to get them rinsed.
[20:43.000 --> 20:49.000]  So use some enzymes. Get a container of water. Fill it like you just normally would.
[20:49.000 --> 20:56.000]  Put your enzymes in there at the recommended dosage. Adjust the pH to about 6.2, 6.4, maybe 6.5, right in that range.
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  Did you say what your pH is? You didn't tell me that. But adjust that pH. Get the pH corrected.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  Then water those plants to about 10 to 20% runoff. Then, if you want to, test that runoff and see where you are.
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  Is it still high? Is it still low? If it's still too high for your liking, flush again.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  Run that flush one more time. Get it down until those numbers are kind of low.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  I don't know how low you want to go. I don't know what's wrong with your plants.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  But you can flush until you get those numbers fairly low.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  Then, at that point, we need to feed the plants. We just cleaned out the cocoa.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  There's nothing in there for those plants to eat. They're going to start starving.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  They're going to start cannibalizing themselves. So now is the time to mix up a solid, balanced diet.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  Do you have a good NPK ratio in there? Do you have CalMag in there?
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  Do you have all the micro and macro nutrients that you were feeding your plants? Are they all in there?
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  Did you mix up a nice mix and pH that? Put some microbes in there. Then feed that to the plants.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  Now we're kind of reviving them and refeeding them.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  Once you've fed that mix, check your runoff again and see what's going on.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  But, if you don't have any issues, I wouldn't mess with it.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  I think the old phrase is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  And you didn't say that the plants are having any problems. You said that the numbers are bad.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  And if the plants aren't showing any problems, those numbers don't make any difference.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  So, if you're not having any problems, don't change anything.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  If you're seeing problems in the plants, put some water with some enzymes in that water.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  Flush it. Maybe flush it twice. Then pay attention to the plants. Pay attention to your runoff.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Then we need to start feeding again.
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  Maybe reduce your feeding. If you're feeding 1200 and it's coming out at 2500,
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  you may be feeding excessively. Maybe increase the amount of runoff.
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  But I know the plants are the boss. No matter what you do, pay attention to those plants.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  I can't see the plants. I don't know if they've got problems. I don't know if they're happy.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  I don't know what else is going on. But the plants are the boss.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  So, without seeing the plants, without more details, without that little chart that I do on the Grow Help tab,
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  I think this is all of the help that I'm able to give you.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  Maybe lower the PPM of your normal feed if you're getting a buildup in there.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  Maybe increase the amount of runoff water.
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.000]  But honestly, pay attention to those plants. And if it ain't broke, do not fix it.
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers, growers,
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all you magical motherfuckers out there,
