[00:00.000 --> 00:01.800]  Hey, welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:01.800 --> 00:06.240]  It is time for episode 421 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.240 --> 00:10.060]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.060 --> 00:14.160]  It is time to add fresh new genetics to your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon Elite
[00:14.160 --> 00:20.920]  Seeds, and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:20.920 --> 00:24.800]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.040]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Han Solo Burger Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.040 --> 00:31.760]  This stuff is delicious.
[00:31.760 --> 00:36.520]  The label says it is a blend of GMO cookies and Larry OGF8.
[00:36.520 --> 00:41.620]  They describe the aroma and flavor as lemon sugar cookies and diesel.
[00:41.620 --> 00:45.080]  As I crack it open, that is a completely accurate description.
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.000]  It smells like you had some Mayer lemon cookies and you tried to smuggle them in the gas tank
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.280]  of the car.
[00:51.280 --> 00:52.960]  The stuff smells amazing.
[00:52.960 --> 00:55.000]  The consistency and texture are beautiful.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.720]  It looks like a little dollop of nicely golden yellow cake frosting right in the center of
[00:59.720 --> 01:00.720]  the container.
[01:00.720 --> 01:01.720]  It is delicious.
[01:01.720 --> 01:02.800]  It is beautiful.
[01:02.800 --> 01:05.600]  Beautiful concentrate from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:05.600 --> 01:07.920]  Big shout out for the Han Solo Burger.
[01:07.920 --> 01:08.920]  I really do like this one.
[01:08.920 --> 01:11.560]  It's kind of gross and kind of delicious at the same time.
[01:11.560 --> 01:13.480]  I really can't get enough of this aroma.
[01:13.480 --> 01:16.920]  I kind of want to press pause and take another dab right now, but let's move forward with
[01:16.920 --> 01:17.920]  the podcast.
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.840]  I do have some shout outs for our friends from Patreon.
[01:20.840 --> 01:23.660]  Let's give a big shout out to my friend Stebby McStabwood.
[01:23.660 --> 01:25.180]  Also a giant shout out to Aldridge.
[01:25.180 --> 01:26.760]  A big shout out to Farmer John.
[01:26.760 --> 01:29.720]  Of course, a giant shout out to my friend Chicago Dabber.
[01:29.720 --> 01:31.680]  As always, a big shout out to our friend Sam.
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.400]  And last but certainly not least, a giant Viking handshake to our friend Grimble the
[01:36.400 --> 01:37.400]  Druid.
[01:37.400 --> 01:40.240]  Big thanks to everybody who has supported the show on Patreon.
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.520]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[01:44.520 --> 01:46.480]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:46.480 --> 01:50.320]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:50.320 --> 01:57.640]  I want to thank everybody for the huge response to my 420 episode and the giant push for 420.
[01:57.640 --> 02:01.320]  In the days leading up to 420, I released quite a few episodes.
[02:01.320 --> 02:06.280]  I got a lot of great response, a lot of reaction from my friends on social media.
[02:06.280 --> 02:09.800]  So I want to give everybody a big thank you for all of the words of encouragement, all
[02:09.800 --> 02:12.280]  of the thanks, all of the high fives, everything.
[02:12.280 --> 02:13.640]  That means a lot to me.
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.440]  Thank you for all the support for the 420 episode and for the push for 420 is what I
[02:18.440 --> 02:19.880]  was calling it.
[02:20.440 --> 02:25.440]  Big thanks to everybody who sent me messages telling me what 420 means to them.
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.320]  There were a few that didn't make it to the show because you guys are potheads and you
[02:29.320 --> 02:31.720]  didn't send them to me until the day of 420.
[02:31.720 --> 02:34.400]  I had already recorded the show, which is just fine.
[02:34.400 --> 02:35.400]  That is cool.
[02:35.400 --> 02:36.920]  I will use them in a future episode.
[02:36.920 --> 02:37.920]  So stay tuned.
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.800]  You may hear what 420 means to you in an upcoming episode.
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.440]  I'm going to gather a few more of those and we'll play them all in one show in the near future.
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.240]  So big thanks to everybody who contributed, supported, listened, and responded to the
[02:50.240 --> 02:53.320]  420 push and the 420 episode.
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.280]  That really means a lot to me to get all of the listener responses and listener reactions.
[02:58.280 --> 03:04.160]  Also, the show crushed it on iTunes and Stitcher in the past couple of weeks in the rankings.
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.640]  I get emails letting me know where I stand in the rankings on iTunes and in Stitcher,
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.160]  and we were doing extremely well in the lifestyle and health category on Stitcher.
[03:13.160 --> 03:15.100]  We were in the low 50s.
[03:15.260 --> 03:19.780]  We hit about 69 at one point, but we got about 45 and 50 for quite a while there.
[03:19.780 --> 03:24.780]  And then on iTunes, we were ranked 44 in the education category on iTunes.
[03:24.780 --> 03:28.940]  And that is big because iTunes is the number one podcast provider.
[03:28.940 --> 03:32.140]  So we were number 44 in a specific category there.
[03:32.140 --> 03:33.140]  I was proud of that.
[03:33.140 --> 03:35.420]  So big thanks to everybody who was listening to the show.
[03:35.420 --> 03:36.420]  We are moving up.
[03:36.420 --> 03:37.420]  More people are catching on.
[03:37.420 --> 03:41.940]  I do appreciate all of the support, all of the sharing, all of the reposting.
[03:42.140 --> 03:43.900]  I was on the Dude Grow show.
[03:43.900 --> 03:45.340]  The podcast has been blowing up.
[03:45.340 --> 03:47.820]  So big thank you to everybody for all of the support.
[03:47.820 --> 03:48.820]  All right.
[03:48.820 --> 03:50.860]  I do have a topic of this podcast.
[03:50.860 --> 03:54.660]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about a phrase we keep hearing in the cannabis industry,
[03:54.660 --> 03:59.100]  in the cannabis community amongst growers, and that is the phrase dialed in.
[03:59.100 --> 04:03.700]  What does it mean to have your grow dialed in?
[04:03.700 --> 04:06.500]  Everybody thinks they have an idea of what the phrase dialed in means.
[04:06.500 --> 04:09.880]  You think you know what it means to have your garden dialed in.
[04:10.020 --> 04:15.160]  At this point in the cannabis growing game, we have access to so many monitoring devices
[04:15.160 --> 04:19.340]  that we should be able to tell what is happening in our garden at all times.
[04:19.340 --> 04:23.720]  We should almost always be able to tell the temperature, the humidity, are the lights
[04:23.720 --> 04:25.160]  off or on.
[04:25.160 --> 04:29.600]  At this point in technology, we are able to monitor most of the critical aspects of our
[04:29.600 --> 04:32.600]  grow room through a handheld device or a computer.
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.960]  It is really easy to buy something and set it up and have full access to monitor your
[04:36.960 --> 04:39.040]  garden at all times.
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.880]  In that aspect, it is really easy to get your lights, your temperature, your humidity, everything
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.560]  in that area dialed in.
[04:46.560 --> 04:48.720]  We can get the room cycling beautifully.
[04:48.720 --> 04:51.600]  That is not a challenge anymore, or at least it shouldn't be.
[04:51.600 --> 04:53.960]  The light should come off and on as scheduled.
[04:53.960 --> 04:56.080]  The temperature should stay right where we need it.
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.880]  The humidity should stay right where we need it.
[04:57.880 --> 05:01.840]  If we learn how to set up our equipment properly, this should not be a challenge to get the
[05:01.840 --> 05:04.000]  room dialed in.
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.800]  The thing I think many growers are overlooking is that we want to actually dial in the room
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.800]  for the plants.
[05:12.800 --> 05:17.560]  What I see happening now, a lot of people are buying these fancy monitors and we're
[05:17.560 --> 05:19.400]  getting it set up on our phone.
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.400]  Now we're able to sit at work or sit wherever we are all day and stress out over the garden
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.480]  because we can watch these numbers and graphs move up and down on our phone and tell us
[05:28.480 --> 05:30.440]  what is happening in the grow.
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.640]  Most of us have not had access to this type of information throughout the day until very
[05:34.640 --> 05:35.640]  recently.
[05:35.640 --> 05:42.120]  So what I see happening is many growers are stressing really hard over the numbers on
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.480]  their monitoring devices and we are forgetting that the plants are the boss.
[05:47.480 --> 05:49.360]  Yes, there are goals.
[05:49.360 --> 05:52.160]  We would like to get the room in a certain temperature threshold.
[05:52.160 --> 05:55.680]  We would like to get the room within a certain humidity threshold.
[05:55.680 --> 05:58.880]  We certainly need the lights to come off and on at a scheduled time.
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.640]  This one we can't really fuck with.
[06:00.640 --> 06:02.780]  But these are plants.
[06:02.780 --> 06:07.880]  We need to keep in mind that no matter what the monitors tell us, the plants are the boss.
[06:07.880 --> 06:11.600]  Yes, there is a gauge that says the VPD should be between here and here.
[06:11.600 --> 06:16.640]  But if the plants aren't happy when you get that VPD between here and here, you're fucking
[06:16.640 --> 06:17.640]  wrong.
[06:17.640 --> 06:21.640]  Those monitors do not matter unless they match with the plants.
[06:21.640 --> 06:23.280]  So I love all of the technology.
[06:23.280 --> 06:24.880]  I love all of the monitors.
[06:24.880 --> 06:30.320]  I started growing long before I had access to that and I was killing it way before I
[06:30.320 --> 06:32.160]  had any of those monitors.
[06:32.160 --> 06:34.520]  You know what I was using for a monitor?
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.520]  The plants.
[06:35.520 --> 06:38.400]  The plants give me all of the signals that I need.
[06:38.400 --> 06:42.000]  By watching those plants, I can see, is it too hot in here?
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.240]  Is it too cold in here?
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.360]  Was it too dry in here?
[06:44.360 --> 06:45.640]  Was it too humid in here?
[06:45.640 --> 06:47.240]  Do these plants need water?
[06:47.240 --> 06:48.440]  Is there something going on?
[06:48.440 --> 06:50.120]  I can tell by looking.
[06:50.120 --> 06:53.160]  I am not disrespecting or knocking these monitors.
[06:53.160 --> 06:54.200]  I love the monitors.
[06:54.520 --> 06:56.680]  I've got monitors hung up in most of my facilities.
[06:56.680 --> 07:00.040]  The most common monitor that I use is the PL Grow Unit Monitor.
[07:00.040 --> 07:02.120]  I've got a PL Minder unit in my favorite room.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.520]  I've got a PL Minder unit in my breeding room.
[07:04.520 --> 07:09.080]  I use the PL Minder because it tells me what's going on when I'm away.
[07:09.080 --> 07:13.320]  The thing I use those monitors for the most is to let me know if something goes wrong
[07:13.320 --> 07:15.680]  with my equipment while I am gone.
[07:15.680 --> 07:17.560]  Then I can react accordingly.
[07:17.560 --> 07:18.640]  I can get online.
[07:18.640 --> 07:20.920]  I can make something else trigger off or trigger on.
[07:20.920 --> 07:24.280]  I can diagnose the problem and figure out what didn't happen or did happen.
[07:24.280 --> 07:27.160]  Then I can correct that while I'm away from the grow.
[07:27.160 --> 07:30.240]  Or I know, hey, I need to end this party and get home and fix that grow.
[07:30.240 --> 07:33.000]  Or, hey, I need to end this party and get out to that facility out on the other side
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.640]  of town as quickly as possible because this monitor is beeping and saying, hey, something
[07:36.640 --> 07:37.760]  went wrong.
[07:37.760 --> 07:40.200]  That is my favorite function of those monitors.
[07:40.200 --> 07:42.840]  They are great for getting a room set up and dialed in.
[07:42.840 --> 07:44.960]  Notice I said getting the room dialed in.
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.040]  Again, the plants are the boss.
[07:48.040 --> 07:51.040]  If you've got the room, let's think about it this way.
[07:51.040 --> 07:55.120]  I'm going to generalize greatly here, and I'm going to piss somebody off by doing so,
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.400]  but just go with me.
[07:56.400 --> 07:58.800]  I've got a thermostat right there on the wall.
[07:58.800 --> 08:04.560]  Science likes to say that if I set that thermostat between 68 and 70 degrees, humans will be
[08:04.560 --> 08:07.200]  at a very comfortable desired temperature.
[08:07.200 --> 08:12.080]  I promise you that if I set that thermostat at 68 degrees, every female in this house
[08:12.080 --> 08:16.040]  is going to come and crank it up to 72 because they're fucking cold.
[08:16.040 --> 08:20.560]  In general, women run a little bit cooler than men from what I've noticed.
[08:20.560 --> 08:25.220]  Also, heavy people, you got a fat friend, notice they're sweaty.
[08:25.220 --> 08:27.120]  Fat people tend to run a little hot.
[08:27.120 --> 08:28.360]  There are women in the house.
[08:28.360 --> 08:29.720]  There are fat people in the house.
[08:29.720 --> 08:31.480]  My skinny ass is in the house.
[08:31.480 --> 08:34.480]  68 degrees just isn't going to happen in the summer here.
[08:34.480 --> 08:37.680]  It takes a lot of electricity to get this house to 68 degrees.
[08:37.680 --> 08:42.160]  Also, I think everybody here knows that 68 degrees just isn't the actual comfortable
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.160]  temperature.
[08:43.160 --> 08:44.740]  The ladies are going to want it around 72.
[08:44.740 --> 08:47.100]  The big guy is going to want it around 65.
[08:47.100 --> 08:50.020]  I'm happy probably right around 74.
[08:50.020 --> 08:53.340]  We all just adjust and we accept it because that's what we've got in the room.
[08:53.340 --> 08:56.740]  Now, that is what you were doing to your plants in the grow room.
[08:56.740 --> 08:58.980]  You're saying, hey, this is what my equipment does.
[08:58.980 --> 09:00.160]  This is what science does.
[09:00.160 --> 09:03.340]  This is what Rasta Jeff said the temperature should be on the podcast.
[09:03.340 --> 09:06.080]  You are a happy plant because you were within this temperature.
[09:06.080 --> 09:09.460]  You were within this humidity range and I fed you this many PPMs.
[09:09.460 --> 09:11.040]  That plant is happy.
[09:11.040 --> 09:12.060]  That is not accurate.
[09:12.060 --> 09:17.020]  You've got to develop a relationship with each individual cultivar and establish what
[09:17.020 --> 09:21.500]  that cultivar wants and dial it in for that plant.
[09:21.500 --> 09:23.940]  I kind of make a joke like it's having a girlfriend.
[09:23.940 --> 09:25.200]  You've got to learn it.
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.600]  Each girlfriend is different.
[09:26.600 --> 09:30.580]  If you have one girlfriend, she probably loves a different kind of food than whatever other
[09:30.580 --> 09:32.140]  girlfriend you got across town.
[09:32.140 --> 09:33.960]  Now, here's the other important part.
[09:33.960 --> 09:36.360]  You can't put them both in the same room and make them happy.
[09:36.360 --> 09:37.540]  That's not going to work.
[09:37.540 --> 09:39.740]  Your plants are probably the same way.
[09:39.740 --> 09:43.140]  You've got to keep them in the environment in which they like.
[09:43.140 --> 09:47.760]  I recommend monocropping one strain until you get it dialed in.
[09:47.760 --> 09:49.380]  I would work with one strain.
[09:49.380 --> 09:53.020]  Pick a strain, fall in love with it, develop a relationship with that plant, figure out
[09:53.020 --> 09:54.600]  what it likes.
[09:54.600 --> 09:58.800]  Instead of trying to grow four or five different strains in a room and having the room work
[09:58.800 --> 10:01.200]  for everything, grow one strain in there.
[10:01.200 --> 10:02.900]  Learn that plant beautifully.
[10:02.900 --> 10:03.900]  What is it like?
[10:03.900 --> 10:05.120]  How much nitrogen does it take?
[10:05.120 --> 10:06.720]  How much CalMag does it want?
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.340]  Is there something you can do late in flower, early in flower to it that makes it really
[10:10.340 --> 10:12.720]  excel, makes it really stand out?
[10:12.720 --> 10:16.040]  You might not know that kind of stuff about that cultivar if you've got it mixed in a
[10:16.040 --> 10:19.300]  room with seven or eight different plants and you're feeding them all the same thing,
[10:19.300 --> 10:21.200]  you're giving them all the same conditions.
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.160]  You can't experiment, so you can't ever dial in one plant.
[10:25.160 --> 10:28.600]  You've got the room dialed in to make the group happy, but you're never going to get
[10:28.600 --> 10:31.760]  one individual plant to reach its maximum potential.
[10:31.760 --> 10:34.760]  Now, I do understand that there are commercial environments.
[10:34.800 --> 10:36.920]  Trust me, I grow in a lot of commercial environments.
[10:36.920 --> 10:42.400]  Your responsibility at that time is to select cultivars that grow with very similar conditions,
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.120]  put them in tables where you can run the feed through that table in one way, maybe run the
[10:46.120 --> 10:48.000]  table on this feed another way.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.120]  Just group the plants to where they work well together.
[10:50.120 --> 10:53.180]  You've got to develop relationships with each cultivar.
[10:53.180 --> 10:54.180]  That takes time.
[10:54.180 --> 10:56.240]  That takes multiple grow cycles.
[10:56.240 --> 10:59.800]  You have to grow it at least two or three times, in my opinion, to learn anything about
[10:59.800 --> 11:00.800]  the plant.
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.000]  The first time, who knows if anything is a fluke.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.120]  That is one time.
[11:05.120 --> 11:07.280]  Science doesn't care about one-time results.
[11:07.280 --> 11:09.800]  One time is a fluke no matter what you ask science.
[11:09.800 --> 11:11.080]  It just happened once.
[11:11.080 --> 11:12.080]  Prove it, repeat it.
[11:12.080 --> 11:13.800]  That is the job, the goal.
[11:13.800 --> 11:18.280]  The second time, if you see, oh, it didn't like nitrogen last time or this time, or hey,
[11:18.280 --> 11:20.800]  I got nitrogen deficient last time and this time.
[11:20.800 --> 11:24.520]  Now, instead of getting frustrated with this cultivar, I know that on the third grow, I
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.360]  need to boost up the nitrogen late in veg so that it is available early in flower, and
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.580]  then also continue that nitrogen feed a little later through the flowering process than I
[11:33.660 --> 11:38.540]  did in the previous grows, and that will help me to not get nitrogen deficient early in
[11:38.540 --> 11:39.540]  flower.
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.980]  You learn things like that if you grow a cultivar repeatedly.
[11:42.980 --> 11:47.340]  If you're a new grower, if you're an experienced grower, it is still an ideal thing to learn
[11:47.340 --> 11:49.060]  the plants individually.
[11:49.060 --> 11:51.740]  Develop a relationship with the cultivar you are working with.
[11:51.740 --> 11:56.300]  If you can isolate one cultivar and cut however many clones you need to fill the room and
[11:56.300 --> 11:59.980]  just run a room of that cultivar, that is the way to learn it.
[11:59.980 --> 12:01.280]  Do it two or three times.
[12:01.280 --> 12:02.460]  Get it dialed in.
[12:02.540 --> 12:06.500]  These plants are from many different parts of the world, and we have bred plants from
[12:06.500 --> 12:10.780]  the farthest parts of the world we can, from point A to point B, the farthest distance
[12:10.780 --> 12:11.780]  we can get them.
[12:11.780 --> 12:15.760]  We have bred those plants together, so we have created many different requirements and
[12:15.760 --> 12:17.420]  desires for these plants.
[12:17.420 --> 12:22.360]  They want generally the same things, but like I said, they're going to want different things.
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.660]  It will be very strain-specific.
[12:24.660 --> 12:27.600]  You also will find it is very phenotype-specific.
[12:27.600 --> 12:33.300]  You may get two seeds from the same pack that create plants that want completely different
[12:33.300 --> 12:34.300]  feeds.
[12:34.300 --> 12:35.300]  Think about if we cross two plants.
[12:35.300 --> 12:38.320]  Let's just say if we cross ... I'm going to pick something that we all know.
[12:38.320 --> 12:40.660]  Let's say Kim dog, and then what's something way different?
[12:40.660 --> 12:41.660]  Tangy.
[12:41.660 --> 12:43.140]  I'm just grabbing strains out of midair.
[12:43.140 --> 12:47.020]  If we cross Kim dog and Tangy, we're going to get some plants that are very Kim dog and
[12:47.020 --> 12:48.980]  some plants that are very Tangy.
[12:48.980 --> 12:51.420]  Those plants want to be fed very differently.
[12:51.420 --> 12:56.520]  You may find that feeding and different traits, different requirements of your plants are
[12:56.540 --> 13:01.060]  different based on different phenotypes within specific strains.
[13:01.060 --> 13:05.100]  Now let's talk about a few of the details that you can really dial in with your plants.
[13:05.100 --> 13:11.820]  As we do this, keep in mind, if you dial in a specific cultivar in your environment, even
[13:11.820 --> 13:17.460]  in your room, if you've got room A and room B in the same facility, things may be different
[13:17.460 --> 13:21.420]  in different sections of those rooms, and things will absolutely be different in the
[13:21.420 --> 13:22.660]  two rooms.
[13:22.660 --> 13:25.260]  It's really hard to mimic exact conditions.
[13:25.280 --> 13:27.560]  Also in large rooms, you're going to get microclimates.
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.560]  We'll talk about those types of things in future episodes, but the things we can dial
[13:31.560 --> 13:36.880]  in, if I take a clone, if I cut a clone, if I cut 20 clones off of my favorite plant,
[13:36.880 --> 13:39.680]  let's just say we're going to cut a bunch of clones off of my storm shadow plant.
[13:39.680 --> 13:41.200]  We've got a bunch of clones.
[13:41.200 --> 13:44.920]  I'm going to put five of them in room A. I'm going to put five of them in room B. I'm going
[13:44.920 --> 13:48.600]  to give five to you, and I'm going to give five to Jesse.
[13:48.600 --> 13:53.560]  Those plants, Jesse's five, are going to look all the same if he puts them in the same room.
[13:53.700 --> 13:55.740]  The four or five are going to look the same if you put them in the same room.
[13:55.740 --> 13:59.260]  All the ones I put in different rooms, the ones in the same room will look the same.
[13:59.260 --> 14:03.900]  The different rooms, we may see slight variation just because of very slight differences in
[14:03.900 --> 14:04.900]  the room.
[14:04.900 --> 14:09.300]  When I talk about getting a room dialed in, it may be when you take this cultivar somewhere
[14:09.300 --> 14:13.940]  else, it may perform differently just within different, very slight differences in the
[14:13.940 --> 14:14.940]  room.
[14:14.940 --> 14:16.980]  If they've got a different type of light, you're going to see different performance.
[14:16.980 --> 14:20.620]  If they're augmenting CO2, you're going to see a different performance.
[14:20.680 --> 14:25.160]  Let's talk about the things that we can dial in in our grow room for our plants, with our
[14:25.160 --> 14:31.280]  plants to maximize the potential of this plant in these expensive rooms we're building.
[14:31.280 --> 14:34.440]  One of the things we really need to dial in is flowering time.
[14:34.440 --> 14:38.000]  A lot of people like to say, this plant takes this many days.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.200]  Pay attention.
[14:39.200 --> 14:40.960]  It's going to be different.
[14:40.960 --> 14:42.600]  Don't believe the guy that grew it before you.
[14:42.600 --> 14:43.640]  Use that as a guideline.
[14:43.640 --> 14:49.120]  If he says it takes 63 days, around day 58, start paying really close attention.
[14:49.140 --> 14:51.300]  If you're going to grow that plant, maybe 70 days.
[14:51.300 --> 14:52.540]  Pay attention to the plant.
[14:52.540 --> 14:57.220]  That dude that grew it before you and told you it takes 63 days is not a trichome head.
[14:57.220 --> 14:59.980]  He does not get to decide when the trichomes are ripe.
[14:59.980 --> 15:03.660]  Your scope, your eyes, that is what decides when those trichomes are ripe.
[15:03.660 --> 15:04.660]  Get in there and look.
[15:04.660 --> 15:06.460]  See when it's done.
[15:06.460 --> 15:08.700]  Flowering time, we can really dial that in.
[15:08.700 --> 15:12.340]  In a commercial environment, it's less likely that you're going to dial in the flowering
[15:12.340 --> 15:13.340]  time.
[15:13.340 --> 15:15.060]  We like to pick things that take nine weeks.
[15:15.060 --> 15:17.500]  You put them in a room, you run all the nine week strains together.
[15:17.520 --> 15:19.360]  They come down at day 63.
[15:19.360 --> 15:20.560]  That's how that goes.
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.800]  In a smaller boutique grow, in a craft grow is what we like to call it now, we're more
[15:24.800 --> 15:27.360]  able to dial in these types of things.
[15:27.360 --> 15:29.880]  Flowering time is something you should absolutely nail.
[15:29.880 --> 15:32.200]  Get that to the perfect day.
[15:32.200 --> 15:34.480]  Also dial in the flush when you do that.
[15:34.480 --> 15:39.060]  That's going to take a couple of flowering cycles because you need to learn exactly how
[15:39.060 --> 15:40.800]  long the plants finish.
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.240]  Then you need to adjust your flush time to that so that you can feed to the maximum feed
[15:45.260 --> 15:47.580]  point and flush to the perfect flush time.
[15:47.580 --> 15:50.580]  You have to learn exactly how long they take to flower.
[15:50.580 --> 15:54.580]  That means you got to run the same cultivar two or three times to get to that point.
[15:54.580 --> 15:59.700]  The other things we need to dial in perfectly, cultivar specific, are the VPD during the
[15:59.700 --> 16:01.500]  day and the night.
[16:01.500 --> 16:04.420]  You're going to have two different desired VPDs for these plants.
[16:04.420 --> 16:05.420]  Pay attention to what they do.
[16:05.420 --> 16:07.600]  What do they look like right when they wake up?
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.460]  Go in there right when the lights come on.
[16:09.460 --> 16:10.460]  Watch those plants.
[16:10.460 --> 16:11.700]  See what they're telling you.
[16:11.700 --> 16:15.880]  You've got monitors to tell you what the temperature and humidity were overnight.
[16:15.880 --> 16:16.880]  You can look at that.
[16:16.880 --> 16:20.040]  As soon as the lights go on, walk in there, look at the plants.
[16:20.040 --> 16:21.560]  You know what the temp and humidity was.
[16:21.560 --> 16:22.840]  You see how they reacted.
[16:22.840 --> 16:25.160]  You can adjust from there as necessary.
[16:25.160 --> 16:29.080]  You can use your monitors during the day to tell you what the VPD, the temperature and
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.800]  the humidity are in that room, but you also need to watch the plants.
[16:32.800 --> 16:34.080]  Are there taco leaves?
[16:34.080 --> 16:36.920]  If the leaves are tacoing up, it's possibly too hot.
[16:36.920 --> 16:38.920]  Are the leaves drooping and acting kind of weird?
[16:38.920 --> 16:40.720]  It could be too humid in there.
[16:40.740 --> 16:46.300]  Pay attention to the plants and use the info from your monitors to make an educated decision
[16:46.300 --> 16:49.620]  and then dial in the equipment to work for the plant.
[16:49.620 --> 16:51.460]  We want the plant to be the boss.
[16:51.460 --> 16:52.820]  The plant is the queen in there.
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.300]  We've got to make the queen happy.
[16:54.300 --> 16:55.300]  You're the king.
[16:55.300 --> 16:59.260]  Your job now is to make that queen happy and you've got to do that by dialing in all of
[16:59.260 --> 17:00.260]  the equipment.
[17:00.260 --> 17:03.580]  The other thing you can think about are the nutrients.
[17:03.580 --> 17:07.540]  Some of these plants are going to want completely different diets than the other plants.
[17:07.540 --> 17:08.880]  Look at the people around you.
[17:08.900 --> 17:11.140]  There might be three or four people in the room near you.
[17:11.140 --> 17:14.900]  Are you guys all going to agree on the same exact meal for lunch?
[17:14.900 --> 17:16.140]  Probably not.
[17:16.140 --> 17:17.300]  The plants are the same way.
[17:17.300 --> 17:21.020]  If you've got three or four strains in that room, they probably want three or four different
[17:21.020 --> 17:23.260]  meals just slightly different.
[17:23.260 --> 17:27.580]  Yes, from a commercial aspect, we can feed them all the same thing and it will work.
[17:27.580 --> 17:29.420]  We will get impressive results.
[17:29.420 --> 17:34.280]  But imagine if I broke that room down that has nine different plants in there and I isolated
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.880]  it to just two different strains and I was running one table with one strain and one
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.000]  table with another strain and I'd ran those for like three months and I've got several
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.600]  crops under my belt of these strains specifically and I've taken a lot of notes.
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.940]  I can make those plants that much better.
[17:49.940 --> 17:51.260]  I could pull that much more weight.
[17:51.260 --> 17:53.060]  I can get that much more harvest.
[17:53.060 --> 17:54.720]  I can get that much more potency.
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.380]  I can probably get another bonus if I do this correctly.
[17:58.380 --> 17:59.380]  So learn the plants.
[17:59.380 --> 18:00.380]  Dial them in.
[18:00.380 --> 18:03.160]  Does your specific cultivar need more nitrogen?
[18:03.160 --> 18:04.160]  Golden goat.
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.300]  I know golden goat can use more macro and micronutrients.
[18:07.300 --> 18:09.820]  She just eats through the nutrients early in flower.
[18:09.820 --> 18:11.800]  So boost her up and feed her heavily.
[18:11.800 --> 18:15.140]  There are some things that if you feed her as hard as golden goat, you will roast the
[18:15.140 --> 18:16.140]  shit out of it.
[18:16.140 --> 18:19.060]  So you can't put that plant and golden goat on the same table.
[18:19.060 --> 18:20.940]  It simply will not work.
[18:20.940 --> 18:25.140]  It is always a good idea to keep girl scout cookie and cookie dominant crosses on the
[18:25.140 --> 18:30.780]  same table together because they like to be fed a lower pH and a very specific feeding.
[18:30.780 --> 18:34.400]  Keep your OG Kush shit together because it likes a little extra cow mag.
[18:34.400 --> 18:38.720]  There are things that you will learn by working with cultivars over time, but you can't really
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.500]  learn that by grouping them together.
[18:40.500 --> 18:42.600]  So you can learn to adjust the nutrients.
[18:42.600 --> 18:44.000]  Does something want more cow mag?
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.760]  Does it want more phosphorus?
[18:45.760 --> 18:47.000]  Does it need more potassium?
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.720]  You can learn that sort of stuff.
[18:48.720 --> 18:54.080]  You need to learn possibly how much and how often do specific cultivars want water.
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.900]  Let's talk about the golden goat again.
[18:55.900 --> 18:57.040]  She likes to drink, bro.
[18:57.040 --> 19:00.280]  That plant has got fish roots that you could just water it.
[19:00.280 --> 19:02.000]  You can't overwater a golden goat plant.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.820]  You could throw it in the fucking lake and let it float and it will drink the lake.
[19:05.820 --> 19:11.020]  On the other hand, there is a plant that is called cookie wreck that if you give it two
[19:11.020 --> 19:14.940]  drops too much water, it gets droopy and it gets all finicky and it starts acting like
[19:14.940 --> 19:17.500]  a little bitch for like two or three days.
[19:17.500 --> 19:21.060]  And that's just the difference in two plants, completely different genetics.
[19:21.060 --> 19:22.880]  The plants look completely different.
[19:22.880 --> 19:26.380]  You can't put them on the same table with an auto feed system because you're either
[19:26.380 --> 19:30.280]  going to completely drown the cookie wreck or you're going to starve and dry out the
[19:30.280 --> 19:31.280]  golden goat.
[19:31.280 --> 19:34.140]  So you've got to learn that those go on two different tables.
[19:34.140 --> 19:35.140]  You can't run them together.
[19:35.140 --> 19:38.720]  Or the trick is if some asshole does put them in the same room, I put two drippers in the
[19:38.720 --> 19:40.400]  golden goat so it gets twice as much.
[19:40.400 --> 19:41.400]  That's the way around that.
[19:41.400 --> 19:42.920]  But you don't want to have to fuck with that.
[19:42.920 --> 19:43.920]  You want it to be easy.
[19:43.920 --> 19:46.080]  You want to grow to not be a pain in the ass.
[19:46.080 --> 19:50.480]  So learn the cultivars and that way you know that that golden goat is a lush.
[19:50.480 --> 19:51.560]  You can plan ahead.
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.960]  I'm going to need to water a little extra because I'm growing golden goat and she just
[19:54.980 --> 19:57.160]  wants to drink it up and drink it up.
[19:57.160 --> 20:00.300]  Also that golden goat probably may want a little higher temperature than that cook or
[20:00.300 --> 20:01.980]  humidity than that cookie wreck.
[20:01.980 --> 20:03.980]  The cookie wreck doesn't want it as humid.
[20:03.980 --> 20:05.080]  It's got a little wider leaves.
[20:05.080 --> 20:07.740]  It's probably going to get PM if you give it that much humidity.
[20:07.740 --> 20:13.140]  So those are things to think about cultivar wise that you can dial in for nutrients.
[20:13.140 --> 20:17.380]  Calamag is always something you got to pay attention to that is cultivar specific watering.
[20:17.380 --> 20:20.160]  How often, how much water that is going to be cultivar specific.
[20:20.220 --> 20:27.100]  Calamag is also very medium specific, pot size specific, but is plant specific mostly.
[20:27.100 --> 20:30.340]  Let's talk about things like defoliating, topping and training.
[20:30.340 --> 20:35.060]  Things like that are very strain and cultivar and phenotype specific.
[20:35.060 --> 20:39.220]  If you take as many leaves off of the golden goat as you took off of that cookie wreck,
[20:39.220 --> 20:41.100]  you would piss off the golden goat.
[20:41.100 --> 20:44.900]  There are some strains you can strip them butt naked and in three days they're spitting
[20:44.900 --> 20:47.340]  out way more leaves than they ever had.
[20:47.340 --> 20:50.860]  There are some if you strip them too naked, the leaves don't ever come back and the plants
[20:50.860 --> 20:53.680]  look sparse and shitty through the entire growth cycle.
[20:53.680 --> 20:56.840]  You have got to learn which plants can tolerate this.
[20:56.840 --> 21:00.640]  And sometimes here's my suggestion and it scares the shit out of people, but here's
[21:00.640 --> 21:01.980]  the way to learn.
[21:01.980 --> 21:03.080]  How many plants do you have?
[21:03.080 --> 21:05.480]  How many of those need to come out top notch?
[21:05.480 --> 21:08.960]  Do what you normally do with those so that those work for you perfectly.
[21:08.960 --> 21:09.960]  You know the outcome.
[21:09.960 --> 21:11.560]  Don't mess with those.
[21:11.560 --> 21:14.360]  Dedicate a couple of plants to experiments if you can.
[21:14.360 --> 21:18.180]  Let's not go crazy with them, but let's try something new.
[21:18.180 --> 21:21.580]  If those two plants in the back of the room are going to get grown the normal way, let's
[21:21.580 --> 21:24.880]  take one of the plants up front and defoliate the shit out of it.
[21:24.880 --> 21:26.380]  Let's go super hard.
[21:26.380 --> 21:30.660]  And then at the end of the grow, let's weigh everything and see if that one that we defoliated
[21:30.660 --> 21:33.900]  weighs less or more than the one that we didn't defoliate.
[21:33.900 --> 21:34.900]  Then we've got another plant.
[21:34.900 --> 21:37.400]  If you've got four, maybe you've got another plant in the front you can play with and do
[21:37.400 --> 21:42.260]  another experiment to maybe feed it a little extra something or a little less something
[21:42.360 --> 21:46.040]  or do something weird to it and see, compare that to the other plants.
[21:46.040 --> 21:49.960]  And then we can see if the weight is different, if the potency is different and the final
[21:49.960 --> 21:50.960]  outcome.
[21:50.960 --> 21:55.400]  The only way we're going to learn things is by growing a strain repeatedly and by having
[21:55.400 --> 21:56.940]  some sort of a control group.
[21:56.940 --> 22:01.440]  So take some notes, have like a standard way that you normally grow, then pick a couple
[22:01.440 --> 22:04.680]  of plants and do some weird shit to them and see how they react.
[22:04.680 --> 22:07.680]  That is the only way you're going to become a better grower.
[22:07.680 --> 22:12.900]  That's the best way to become established and build a relationship with each cultivar.
[22:12.900 --> 22:17.140]  So things like defoliating and topping and training and twisting and working them into
[22:17.140 --> 22:22.340]  the net, things like that, bottoming, lollipopping, those are all going to be very strain specific
[22:22.340 --> 22:24.540]  type of things that you have to learn.
[22:24.540 --> 22:27.380]  Things like, let's say the grateful dog.
[22:27.380 --> 22:32.260]  I don't bottom it as much because the bottom buds get kind of nice and dense on there.
[22:32.260 --> 22:35.540]  Maybe the lemon Jeffrey, I would bottom that a little bit because those little bottom buds
[22:35.560 --> 22:38.160]  get a little bit airy at the very base of the stock.
[22:38.160 --> 22:42.080]  So I will just treat them different when it comes to bottoming and lollipopping.
[22:42.080 --> 22:44.660]  Strawberry starburst makes big giant buds up top.
[22:44.660 --> 22:46.640]  So I take a lot off the bottom because I don't need it.
[22:46.640 --> 22:48.840]  I already know it's going to be huge up top.
[22:48.840 --> 22:53.640]  I also know exactly how much to defoliate that strawberry starburst to make it go kapow
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.820]  because if you de-leaf it too much, you kind of slow her down.
[22:56.820 --> 23:01.000]  If you de-leaf her too early, if you give her time to get a little bit too leafy and
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.720]  then defoliate her kind of nice, she'll keep growing.
[23:03.900 --> 23:06.500]  As soon as those leaves come back, take them off again.
[23:06.500 --> 23:09.580]  Don't go stripping her like level 10 right away because it'll stop her from growing.
[23:09.580 --> 23:13.240]  You got to give her five level two strips and she'll keep going for you.
[23:13.240 --> 23:15.540]  It's just small things like that that you will learn.
[23:15.540 --> 23:17.380]  It's just like hanging out with people.
[23:17.380 --> 23:18.660]  They've all got a relationship.
[23:18.660 --> 23:19.820]  They've all got different needs.
[23:19.820 --> 23:24.420]  And when you meet those needs of each person, each plant, we can help all of them reach
[23:24.420 --> 23:25.420]  their maximum potential.
[23:25.420 --> 23:29.460]  And as a grower, as a farmer, that should be one of our goals.
[23:29.460 --> 23:32.580]  If you're completely satisfied and happy with the way that your crop is coming out, keep
[23:32.580 --> 23:33.580]  doing it.
[23:33.600 --> 23:36.760]  If you would like to push your crop, your goal, your garden to the next level, let's
[23:36.760 --> 23:38.100]  get it dialed in.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.960]  Let's stop worrying about the gauges and the meters.
[23:40.960 --> 23:41.960]  Those are awesome.
[23:41.960 --> 23:44.520]  Those really help us out, but they're not the boss.
[23:44.520 --> 23:47.040]  The plants are the boss.
[23:47.040 --> 23:51.720]  So let's pay just as much attention to the meters and let's pay a little bit more attention.
[23:51.720 --> 23:56.700]  Let's go back to the old school and pay attention to the plants, the leaves, the soil, everything
[23:56.700 --> 24:01.460]  involved in the plant is going to tell you what is actually happening with that plant.
[24:01.460 --> 24:03.500]  The meters tell you what's going on in the room.
[24:03.500 --> 24:05.700]  The plant will tell you what's happening with the plant.
[24:05.700 --> 24:09.600]  A joke I made earlier, trying to figure out what is wrong with your girlfriend by looking
[24:09.600 --> 24:11.960]  at her Facebook status is never going to work.
[24:11.960 --> 24:15.280]  You have to sit down and ask your girlfriend what is wrong.
[24:15.280 --> 24:16.580]  The plants are the same way.
[24:16.580 --> 24:18.180]  The monitors won't tell you.
[24:18.180 --> 24:20.880]  Look at the plants, sit down and ask them what's wrong.
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.120]  And they're going to tell you.
[24:22.120 --> 24:24.740]  Pay attention to the garden, pay attention to the meters.
[24:24.740 --> 24:27.380]  Most importantly, have fun in your grow.
[24:27.380 --> 24:29.900]  Grow from your heart, have a good time and enjoy it.
[24:29.900 --> 24:33.460]  And that's the best way to produce high quality cannabis.
[24:33.460 --> 24:35.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, this was a really fun podcast to do.
