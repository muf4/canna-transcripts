[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  All right, welcome back podcast world.
[00:01.960 --> 00:06.560]  It is time for episode 528 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.560 --> 00:08.920]  Joining me via Zoom is our buddy, White Mike.
[00:08.920 --> 00:09.920]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:09.920 --> 00:10.920]  Thanks, man.
[00:10.920 --> 00:11.920]  What's up, everybody?
[00:11.920 --> 00:14.560]  Hey, Mike, how was your 420, bro?
[00:14.560 --> 00:15.560]  Splendid.
[00:15.560 --> 00:17.120]  He giggled and said, splendid.
[00:17.120 --> 00:18.360]  That is not the answer I expected.
[00:18.360 --> 00:19.720]  I don't know what I expected.
[00:19.720 --> 00:23.040]  That certainly was not the reply I was waiting for.
[00:23.040 --> 00:24.040]  Splendid.
[00:24.040 --> 00:29.960]  I had to stay home and I was told it was my patriotic duty to have food delivered.
[00:30.920 --> 00:33.240]  I did and it was wonderful.
[00:33.240 --> 00:34.240]  All right.
[00:34.240 --> 00:38.200]  Yeah, we could talk all day about what you ate, but it is your patriotic duty to eat
[00:38.200 --> 00:39.200]  and have food delivered.
[00:39.200 --> 00:40.200]  That's cool.
[00:40.200 --> 00:41.200]  You're keeping all the local restaurants alive.
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.840]  I think you were doing a very good job at keeping some of your favorite spots surviving
[00:45.840 --> 00:47.840]  during this weird situation.
[00:47.840 --> 00:50.280]  It was a weird 420.
[00:50.280 --> 00:54.480]  I've talked about my 420 already on the show because I've done a couple episodes without
[00:54.480 --> 00:58.280]  you, but man, was it weird as shit just doing a 420 at home this year?
[00:58.320 --> 01:00.640]  No event, no hype, no craziness.
[01:00.640 --> 01:03.720]  It was a little weird that there wasn't any craziness.
[01:03.720 --> 01:11.920]  I'm pretty low key these last couple of years and the craziness I get is usually while I
[01:11.920 --> 01:17.480]  was trying to shop for 420 supplies related more than big 420 event related.
[01:17.480 --> 01:22.200]  Well, you would have been at my booth with us at the Dude Grows Cup over the weekend
[01:22.200 --> 01:23.200]  on the 18th.
[01:23.200 --> 01:24.200]  You would have been there.
[01:24.200 --> 01:31.840]  I had it scheduled, but instead I hit up a local dispensary the day before.
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.000]  I walked up, there was no line.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  I walked right in.
[01:36.000 --> 01:43.080]  I spent more money than I intended to in a bunch of really pleasant ways and walked back
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.080]  out to my car.
[01:44.080 --> 01:49.800]  And then the next day I overindulged and then, as I mentioned earlier, ordered some delicious,
[01:49.800 --> 01:50.800]  delicious takeout.
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.680]  It sounds like it was more a takeout and grub and relax day than it was 420 for you this
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.680]  year.
[01:56.680 --> 01:57.680]  There was a lot of 420 involved.
[01:57.680 --> 01:58.680]  All right.
[01:58.680 --> 01:59.680]  There was a lot of 420 involved.
[01:59.680 --> 02:01.940]  As long as you got your 420 in.
[02:01.940 --> 02:06.080]  This episode of Two Guys Coughing is brought to you by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[02:06.080 --> 02:09.800]  Seedsherenow.com carries seeds from all of the industry's favorite breeders, including

[02:30.540 --> 02:38.340]  Again, that is coupon code GFYH10 at checkout at seedsherenow.com.
[02:38.340 --> 02:41.860]  It seems to be the trend to get some seeds and get them going during this quarantine
[02:41.860 --> 02:42.860]  time.
[02:42.860 --> 02:43.860]  So join the gang, you guys.
[02:43.860 --> 02:44.860]  Get some seeds going.
[02:44.860 --> 02:47.320]  I want to see what you're growing on social media.
[02:47.320 --> 02:49.120]  Like me, let me know what you're growing.
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.400]  On Instagram, it is at Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[02:52.400 --> 02:54.260]  I was going to say GFYH Podcast.
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.260]  That is Twitter.
[02:55.260 --> 02:57.380]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH Podcast.
[02:57.380 --> 03:00.200]  Let me know what you're growing during the quarantine.
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.080]  All right, Mike.
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.520]  In this portion of the show, I'd like to give shout outs to a few of the friends who support
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.160]  us on Patreon.
[03:08.160 --> 03:10.340]  So let's just get right to it.
[03:10.340 --> 03:13.840]  Without all the folks who support us on Patreon, there would not be a podcast.
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.560]  Patreon is what paid for the Zoom connection.
[03:16.560 --> 03:17.760]  Zoom costs a few bucks.
[03:17.760 --> 03:20.320]  We covered that with the Patreon campaign.
[03:20.320 --> 03:21.320]  That's right.
[03:21.320 --> 03:22.500]  We appreciate the support.
[03:22.500 --> 03:26.200]  We got Mike a recording set up through the Patreon campaign.
[03:26.200 --> 03:28.280]  I thought that first trial episode sounded pretty good.
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.680]  I think we bought the right toys.
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.680]  I think we did a good job.
[03:30.680 --> 03:31.680]  I think you did a good job.
[03:31.680 --> 03:33.720]  Earl, we did a right job selecting the equipment.
[03:33.720 --> 03:37.280]  Shout out to my friend at Sweetwater for helping me select the appropriate gear.
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.280]  Good job to Mike.
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.520]  He's now an audio producer, you guys.
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.200]  He gets production credit now.
[03:41.200 --> 03:42.200]  Oh, snap.
[03:42.200 --> 03:43.200]  Oh, snap.
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.720]  He nodded his head at first and realized, oh, fuck, it's a podcast.
[03:46.720 --> 03:49.280]  At this portion of the show, we're going to shout out to our friends at Patreon.
[03:49.280 --> 03:53.360]  Let's start off with a big shout out to our buddy, Giant Mike and the Dabbing Queen.
[03:53.360 --> 03:57.240]  Let's send a big giant shout out to our friend, Jacob W. Let's send some digital love over
[03:57.240 --> 03:58.880]  to our buddy, Godfather Kush.
[03:58.880 --> 04:02.040]  I've always got a high five and a shout out for my buddy, Redbeard.
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.920]  Let's send a giant girl from your heart podcast shout out to the hardest working man in cannabis.
[04:05.920 --> 04:07.620]  His name is James Brown.
[04:07.620 --> 04:11.200]  Let's send a big high five and a shout out to my buddy, Keith K. I've always got a fist
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.160]  bump and a high five and a shout out for my friend, Oki Gross 720.
[04:15.160 --> 04:19.440]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Todd K. And last but certainly not least, let's
[04:19.440 --> 04:24.660]  send a big thank you shout out to my buddy, Steve motherfucking Smith.
[04:24.660 --> 04:25.660]  Thank you guys.
[04:25.660 --> 04:29.380]  Big thanks and big shout out to each and every one of you for supporting the show on Patreon.
[04:29.380 --> 04:32.500]  If you are not supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so, all you
[04:32.500 --> 04:38.960]  have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[04:38.960 --> 04:42.740]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[04:42.740 --> 04:47.260]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes for all of my stoned friends to
[04:47.260 --> 04:48.820]  make it easy.
[04:48.820 --> 04:50.620]  Thanks again, you guys, for all of the support.
[04:50.620 --> 04:54.420]  All right, Mike, I think I'm done with all of the business for the show.
[04:54.420 --> 04:58.960]  This is the part of the show where I'm going to ask, what are you dabbing on today, bro?
[04:58.960 --> 05:06.380]  Right now I'm enjoying a plethora of options from Apothecary.
[05:06.380 --> 05:08.140]  I mentioned I went a little nuts.
[05:08.320 --> 05:09.320]  You did mention that.
[05:09.320 --> 05:12.840]  Just now it was some Mambo batter.
[05:12.840 --> 05:20.240]  Rocking 93.7 total cannabinoids, 79.1% THC.
[05:20.240 --> 05:22.240]  Really tasty.
[05:22.240 --> 05:23.240]  I've smoked the Mambo.
[05:23.240 --> 05:24.240]  It's like a symbol of the face.
[05:24.240 --> 05:25.920]  It kind of sets you down.
[05:25.920 --> 05:27.240]  It makes, sets me down at least.
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.040]  Makes me, I'm a moving kind of guy and that one makes me less movementy.
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.040]  Yep.
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.680]  I, I'm having trouble to stand on the microphone right now.
[05:34.680 --> 05:39.420]  I find myself drifting back into my chair and I think the Mambo might be partially responsible
[05:39.420 --> 05:40.420]  for that.
[05:40.420 --> 05:43.660]  So I might sativa it up on our next dab.
[05:43.660 --> 05:45.860]  We'll take a break for the next dab whenever you're ready, buddy.
[05:45.860 --> 05:48.260]  So you just say when and I can keep talking.
[05:48.260 --> 05:51.420]  You take a dab and then you're going to have to talk and I'll take a dab, but teamwork
[05:51.420 --> 05:52.420]  will make this shit happen.
[05:52.420 --> 05:55.900]  I feel like I just stepped all over you when you were trying to talk, but we'll fix that.
[05:55.900 --> 05:56.900]  Loving the zoom format.
[05:56.900 --> 05:58.300]  Dude, it's so good.
[05:58.300 --> 06:00.260]  There's very minimal delay.
[06:00.260 --> 06:01.260]  Last time we had more delay.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.740]  This time it's like very nice ping.
[06:02.740 --> 06:03.740]  It's really nice.
[06:03.800 --> 06:05.800]  You don't get that weird echo and yeah, it's cool.
[06:05.800 --> 06:08.280]  Shout out to zoom for helping us out.
[06:08.280 --> 06:13.280]  I am taking dabs since you asked of first class.
[06:13.280 --> 06:14.280]  Thanks for asking, bro.
[06:14.280 --> 06:15.280]  I thought you'd never ask.
[06:15.280 --> 06:19.340]  Uh, today I'm hitting first class funk live batter from green dot labs.
[06:19.340 --> 06:23.560]  First class funk is a blend of GMO and jet fuel gelato.
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.280]  I know those two strains very well and I can taste them individually in the dabs.
[06:28.280 --> 06:29.860]  I know that sounds crazy.
[06:29.860 --> 06:32.740]  I am very familiar with many of the strains in Colorado.
[06:32.740 --> 06:34.160]  We get a lot of the same strains.
[06:34.160 --> 06:39.020]  We're growing a lot of the same shit in the commercial and also the private grow sector
[06:39.020 --> 06:40.020]  here in Colorado.
[06:40.020 --> 06:41.380]  The clones get passed around.
[06:41.380 --> 06:42.840]  We've all got the same shit.
[06:42.840 --> 06:45.600]  I can definitely taste GMO when I open the jar.
[06:45.600 --> 06:47.820]  The first aroma is GMO.
[06:47.820 --> 06:52.180]  When you put your face closer to it and get the, um, I don't know, like the real, I don't
[06:52.180 --> 06:53.180]  know the essence.
[06:53.180 --> 06:54.620]  That's where the jet fuel gelato comes in.
[06:54.620 --> 06:57.220]  That sweetness kicks in the second half.
[06:57.220 --> 06:58.220]  Yeah.
[06:58.220 --> 06:59.220]  Yeah.
[06:59.220 --> 07:00.220]  And my, my nose is just crazy.
[07:00.220 --> 07:02.460]  People say I'm nuts, but other people completely agree with me.
[07:03.180 --> 07:07.060]  The package describes the flavor as hashy, grape, fuel, and garlic.
[07:07.060 --> 07:08.660]  I certainly get the hashy.
[07:08.660 --> 07:10.380]  The grape is in there at the very end.
[07:10.380 --> 07:12.620]  When you exhale, the grape kind of chills on your tongue.
[07:12.620 --> 07:14.980]  The fuel it's there, but it's subtle.
[07:14.980 --> 07:19.100]  The garlic is one of the most dominant flavors in this.
[07:19.100 --> 07:20.700]  Obviously it's got me fucking talkative.
[07:20.700 --> 07:28.300]  On the back it says it contains 66.91% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[07:28.300 --> 07:29.300]  I dig it, dude.
[07:29.300 --> 07:30.300]  It tastes good.
[07:30.300 --> 07:31.300]  I've been buying a lot of this one.
[07:31.300 --> 07:32.300]  It's reliable.
[07:32.340 --> 07:35.660]  I like the texture, the flavor, and the buzz are all what I'm looking for.
[07:35.660 --> 07:36.860]  I'm not even kissing their ass.
[07:36.860 --> 07:38.340]  I just like it that much.
[07:38.340 --> 07:41.140]  Mike is smoking apothecary and today I'm smoking green dot.
[07:41.140 --> 07:45.380]  So big shout out to green dot labs for the first class funk and shout out to our friends
[07:45.380 --> 07:47.380]  at apothecary for that mambo.
[07:47.380 --> 07:50.380]  All right, Mike, I'm nice and medicated.
[07:50.380 --> 07:54.620]  I was going to do a quick garden update and then maybe we can read a couple of listener
[07:54.620 --> 07:55.660]  emails.
[07:55.660 --> 07:59.780]  And I've got one more quiz for you before we get to the listener emails.
[07:59.780 --> 08:02.020]  Let's talk about my garden, dude.
[08:02.740 --> 08:09.140]  I'm using some LED lights and I am new to the LED world.
[08:09.140 --> 08:14.220]  I've got two Canon LEDs in a five by five tent.
[08:14.220 --> 08:16.260]  They are from Black Sale Market.
[08:16.260 --> 08:19.860]  Big shout out to my buddy Keith at Black Sale, killing the game.
[08:19.860 --> 08:23.060]  Wonderful customer service, beautiful communication.
[08:23.060 --> 08:26.740]  When we agreed that I would put lights in my garden, the deal was handled and the lights
[08:26.740 --> 08:27.740]  were here.
[08:27.740 --> 08:28.740]  They shipped that day.
[08:28.740 --> 08:29.740]  He's like, I'll send you the lights.
[08:29.740 --> 08:31.220]  And then I got a shipping notification.
[08:31.940 --> 08:35.620]  It's always nice when you make a deal, you shake a hand and then you get an invoice and
[08:35.620 --> 08:36.620]  a shipping notification.
[08:36.620 --> 08:37.620]  Like, here they go.
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.620]  So that was great.
[08:38.620 --> 08:39.620]  They were here.
[08:39.620 --> 08:40.980]  It only took the time of UPS or FedEx.
[08:40.980 --> 08:45.060]  However long they took is how long it took me to get my lights.
[08:45.060 --> 08:49.020]  I'm not even trying to kiss this dude's butt or anything.
[08:49.020 --> 08:51.380]  When I plugged those lights in, I went, oh, fuck.
[08:51.380 --> 08:52.900]  Those lights are so bright, dude.
[08:52.900 --> 08:57.740]  I'd cover my eyes and lean back and look for the plug-in so I can unplug them and reorient
[08:57.740 --> 08:58.740]  myself.
[08:58.740 --> 08:59.740]  I was like, this shit is super bright.
[08:59.740 --> 09:02.260]  I've got two of them now in a five by five.
[09:02.260 --> 09:08.660]  I've got them over some clones and some seedlings and my plants look impressive, dude.
[09:08.660 --> 09:14.500]  They are shorter and stout than they, more stout than they usually would be.
[09:14.500 --> 09:20.180]  With those clones that I saw photos of the other day, are those from off and under these
[09:20.180 --> 09:21.180]  lights?
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.420]  Those are Jack the Ripper seedlings.
[09:22.420 --> 09:23.620]  Those are from seed, buddy.
[09:23.620 --> 09:25.260]  And yes, those are.
[09:25.260 --> 09:29.460]  And those are from those lights with a super tight node spacing, super tight node spacing,
[09:30.180 --> 09:31.180]  lots of bushyness.
[09:31.180 --> 09:32.260]  Yeah, they look amazing.
[09:32.260 --> 09:37.340]  They just got put into a five gallon pots and they are, they've been under there for
[09:37.340 --> 09:39.900]  12 hours at this point and they have exploded.
[09:39.900 --> 09:41.260]  They are going crazy.
[09:41.260 --> 09:42.260]  Yeah.
[09:42.260 --> 09:44.260]  So I'm excited with the LEDs.
[09:44.260 --> 09:45.740]  I have finally got two plugged in.
[09:45.740 --> 09:50.660]  We were comparing it to the equivalent of the 600 watt light that was in that room.
[09:50.660 --> 09:54.560]  And my friend told me, Keith told me that they should be less heat.
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.920]  They should produce less heat than the HPS light I had in there.
[09:59.920 --> 10:02.620]  And so far I feel like that's accurate.
[10:02.620 --> 10:07.360]  Today is one of the coolest days we've had so far, or warmest days we've had so far.
[10:07.360 --> 10:09.280]  And it's not, sorry, I'm stumbling over my word stay.
[10:09.280 --> 10:12.840]  It's the warmest day we've had in a while and it's not too hot in that room with both
[10:12.840 --> 10:13.920]  of those lights running.
[10:13.920 --> 10:15.680]  So that's pretty nice.
[10:15.680 --> 10:16.680]  Rapid growth.
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.720]  They seem to want to eat more nutrients.
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.960]  Also, it feels like they may want more food.
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.200]  I don't know if that's because they're seedlings, but some of them look a little bit hungrier
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.480]  already for their size, but I'm impressed with the growth.
[10:28.480 --> 10:30.000]  The plants are going fast.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.160]  There's not as much heat.
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.000]  I haven't had them long enough to know if there's an effect on the electricity bill,
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.200]  but it should go down compared to what we were getting with the HPS light.
[10:41.200 --> 10:42.440]  I'm excited for this project.
[10:42.440 --> 10:44.680]  Yeah, it looks great.
[10:44.680 --> 10:47.520]  So that's what's happening in my little tester area.
[10:47.520 --> 10:48.760]  I've got some LEDs, you guys.
[10:48.760 --> 10:51.000]  I'm brand new to the LED world.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  I wasn't convinced.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.840]  If you want to see the photos I was just talking about, check out Jeff's Instagram.
[10:56.840 --> 10:58.400]  What's the handle, buddy?
[10:58.400 --> 11:01.160]  Those will be on irie underscore genetics.
[11:01.160 --> 11:05.360]  So check out irie underscore genetics and I will try to remember to update the Grow
[11:05.360 --> 11:07.520]  From Your Heart podcast Instagram as well.
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.480]  I do have a podcast for the show.
[11:09.480 --> 11:12.060]  Honestly, social media can be overwhelming.
[11:12.060 --> 11:13.060]  Sometimes I take a short break.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.060]  I try not to be there too much.
[11:14.060 --> 11:15.280]  I post and get out.
[11:15.280 --> 11:17.840]  I will try to post more to the show.
[11:17.920 --> 11:21.120]  I honestly spend a little bit more time on Cannabuzz.
[11:21.120 --> 11:23.480]  Cannabuzz is a cannabis-friendly social media application.
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.200]  You can't buy, sell, or trade cannabis there, but we do encourage you to post your cannabis
[11:27.200 --> 11:28.200]  photography.
[11:28.200 --> 11:30.320]  You can post your dab photos, your garden photos.
[11:30.320 --> 11:31.320]  Join us on Cannabuzz.
[11:31.320 --> 11:35.400]  It's a free application available on your Android or Apple mobile device.
[11:35.400 --> 11:36.520]  Once you join, find me.
[11:36.520 --> 11:38.200]  I'm irie underscore genetics.
[11:38.200 --> 11:39.920]  I do a lot of great things on Cannabuzz.
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.480]  You'll get a lot of opportunities to acquire irie genetics and a lot of other breeders'
[11:44.480 --> 11:45.840]  seeds on Cannabuzz.
[11:45.840 --> 11:46.840]  So check us out.
[11:46.840 --> 11:47.340]  All right.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.800]  Hey, Mike, how's your garden going?
[11:49.800 --> 11:50.800]  No, I'm just joking, bro.
[11:50.800 --> 11:52.800]  That's like all the comedians asking about dates right now.
[11:52.800 --> 11:53.800]  I'm planting some raised beds, brother.
[11:53.800 --> 11:54.800]  Yeah.
[11:54.800 --> 11:55.800]  I'm planting some raised beds.
[11:55.800 --> 11:57.840]  I'm excited to hear that, dude.
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.840]  All the comedians.
[11:58.840 --> 12:01.120]  I was pricing lumber today, bro.
[12:01.120 --> 12:02.120]  It's going to be a fun summer.
[12:02.120 --> 12:03.120]  I can't wait, dude.
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.280]  You've got your little assistant around now, plus your two new assistants.
[12:06.280 --> 12:08.200]  Life is going to be good for building shit, dude.
[12:08.200 --> 12:09.200]  Oh, dude.
[12:09.200 --> 12:10.200]  Yeah.
[12:10.200 --> 12:11.200]  Yeah.
[12:11.200 --> 12:12.200]  It's going to be a fun summer.
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.360]  I'm going to take a drink of this fucking weird kombucha.
[12:16.360 --> 12:18.360]  Even for kombucha, this is a weird flavor.
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.640]  And then we're going to read this email.
[12:19.640 --> 12:20.640]  Here we go.
[12:20.640 --> 12:21.640]  Get hydrated, boys and girls.
[12:21.640 --> 12:23.160]  Dirty hippie drinks, bro.
[12:23.160 --> 12:25.760]  Dirty hippie drinks.
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.760]  Stick with the good old soda, guys.
[12:27.760 --> 12:28.760]  America.
[12:28.760 --> 12:32.080]  I haven't had a Dr. Pepper.
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.280]  That's what happens if I have to fill unexpectedly.
[12:34.280 --> 12:35.280]  Yeah.
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.280]  I liked it.
[12:36.280 --> 12:37.280]  That was cool.
[12:37.280 --> 12:38.280]  It's what I expected of you, honestly.
[12:38.280 --> 12:39.280]  It's exactly what I thought you would do.
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.240]  I haven't had a Dr. Pepper since February 12th, and we're recording now on April the
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.240]  26th.
[12:44.240 --> 12:45.240]  So, yeah.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.240]  I'm killing it.
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.240]  I feel better.
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.560]  So, in that same vein, it has been three months and four days since I've had a cigarette.
[12:53.560 --> 12:54.560]  Yes.
[12:54.560 --> 12:55.920]  That's more impressive than a Dr. Pepper.
[12:55.920 --> 12:57.480]  So, good job, bro.
[12:57.480 --> 12:59.640]  Because I was watching it fuck up your health.
[12:59.640 --> 13:05.200]  So, I'm glad that my friend isn't killing himself in front of me now.
[13:05.200 --> 13:06.480]  It's been some weird changes.
[13:06.480 --> 13:08.960]  Nothing fucking tastes right still.
[13:08.960 --> 13:09.960]  It'll taste better eventually.
[13:09.960 --> 13:10.960]  Yeah.
[13:10.960 --> 13:11.960]  Allegedly.
[13:11.960 --> 13:12.960]  Oh, dude.
[13:12.960 --> 13:13.960]  I know what that sound was.
[13:14.160 --> 13:17.040]  It made me drool just a little bit.
[13:17.040 --> 13:18.040]  Carbonated goodness.
[13:18.040 --> 13:19.040]  Yeah.
[13:19.040 --> 13:20.040]  All right.
[13:20.040 --> 13:21.040]  Let's get the show back on track.
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.040]  We are doing a podcast over here, Mike.
[13:22.040 --> 13:23.040]  They like it when we ramble, dude.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.040]  It's cool.
[13:24.040 --> 13:25.040]  They do.
[13:25.040 --> 13:27.040]  I think that's what they expect when we get two guys coughing going on.
[13:27.040 --> 13:29.200]  You said something about some emails, I believe.
[13:29.200 --> 13:30.200]  Yes.
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.640]  This one comes from our friends on Patreon.
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.760]  If you are subscribed to Patreon and you send me a message on Patreon, I try to find them.
[13:35.760 --> 13:37.080]  I try to print them out.
[13:37.080 --> 13:39.080]  I get overwhelmed, honestly.
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.160]  It's more likely you'll catch me through email.
[13:41.160 --> 13:42.680]  I'm trying to keep up with all of them.
[13:42.680 --> 13:45.680]  There's only one of me and lots of you, but please bear with me.
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.920]  This one comes from Patreon.
[13:46.920 --> 13:51.760]  It says, hello, just a quick message to say thank you for the nutrient episodes.
[13:51.760 --> 13:57.400]  I picked up some new tips on how to mix and get my PPMs and keep my NPK to the correct
[13:57.400 --> 13:58.400]  amounts.
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.640]  Also, the addition of cow mag has been great and I made an Epsom salt spray and my plants
[14:03.640 --> 14:04.640]  love it.
[14:04.640 --> 14:08.520]  So this person listened to the My Nutrient Mix episodes, volumes one and two, and it
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.620]  sounds like they have improved their gardens.
[14:10.620 --> 14:11.620]  So thank you.
[14:11.620 --> 14:13.460]  I want you to know that that helped out your grow.
[14:13.460 --> 14:15.940]  I put a lot of time and energy into that.
[14:15.940 --> 14:17.300]  Goal achieved, bro.
[14:17.300 --> 14:18.300]  Yeah.
[14:18.300 --> 14:21.580]  So when somebody says, hey, I did better, that's what I was trying to do.
[14:21.580 --> 14:22.580]  One person-
[14:22.580 --> 14:23.580]  That's the whole point of the show.
[14:23.580 --> 14:24.860]  That's literally why we do this show.
[14:24.860 --> 14:25.860]  Exactly.
[14:25.860 --> 14:26.860]  So one person got it better.
[14:26.860 --> 14:28.580]  It was worth my time and energy.
[14:28.580 --> 14:29.580]  So thank you.
[14:29.580 --> 14:31.340]  This also comes from a person who calls themselves Prospect.
[14:31.340 --> 14:32.860]  So you're doing very well.
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.500]  Prospect, soon you'll get your patch.
[14:34.500 --> 14:35.900]  You'll be fucking full fledged.
[14:35.900 --> 14:37.740]  You're on the right path, brother.
[14:37.740 --> 14:38.740]  That's it.
[14:38.740 --> 14:39.740]  We shouldn't make fun of him for that.
[14:39.740 --> 14:41.220]  We may get a phone call for that one.
[14:41.820 --> 14:42.820]  Nope.
[14:42.820 --> 14:43.820]  No hate aside.
[14:43.820 --> 14:44.820]  That's serious.
[14:44.820 --> 14:45.820]  Just Prospect on.
[14:45.820 --> 14:46.820]  Yeah.
[14:46.820 --> 14:47.820]  Nothing but respect, bro.
[14:47.820 --> 14:48.820]  Nothing but respect.
[14:48.820 --> 14:49.820]  Where are we in this message?
[14:49.820 --> 14:53.540]  It says, for everything else I'm using Recharge.
[14:53.540 --> 14:57.740]  Oh, I've also set up my contribution as well, as well deserved, bro.
[14:57.740 --> 14:59.380]  Great work on the podcast.
[14:59.380 --> 15:01.380]  For everything else, I'm using Recharge.
[15:01.380 --> 15:03.220]  It's the shit for indoor tent growing.
[15:03.220 --> 15:04.660]  Yes, Recharge is a great product.
[15:04.660 --> 15:05.700]  I fully endorse that.
[15:05.700 --> 15:08.220]  They don't pay me to talk about it, but I use it.
[15:08.220 --> 15:09.540]  I have Recharge in my garden.
[15:09.540 --> 15:11.860]  I dosed up the grow with Recharge today.
[15:11.860 --> 15:13.900]  They look fucking marvelous because of it.
[15:13.900 --> 15:19.660]  It says, I also have a 25 year old daughter who is getting her associate's degree in digital
[15:19.660 --> 15:21.860]  marketing and business management.
[15:21.860 --> 15:27.900]  So 25 year old young lady with a degree, an associate's degree in digital marketing and
[15:27.900 --> 15:33.060]  business management this year, and she would like to get into the Colorado cannabis industry.
[15:33.060 --> 15:38.140]  Our friend Prospect is looking for any tips on where to get this young lady started.
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.940]  They would be extremely grateful.
[15:40.940 --> 15:46.500]  She, unlike me, is American and currently lives in Florida, but goes to school in Utah.
[15:46.500 --> 15:49.100]  So I take it that Prospect is from another location here.
[15:49.100 --> 15:51.940]  Shout out to our Prospect friend overseas somewhere.
[15:51.940 --> 15:52.940]  Then it says, thanks Jeff.
[15:52.940 --> 15:54.140]  I taught them today.
[15:54.140 --> 15:55.500]  I'll send you a pic to follow.
[15:55.500 --> 15:58.220]  So he's growing some iReed genetics and he'll send me a picture.
[15:58.220 --> 16:02.300]  I will share the picture on the Instagram probably because this guy always sends good
[16:02.300 --> 16:03.300]  photos.
[16:03.300 --> 16:05.060]  So Mike, this is a really good question.
[16:05.060 --> 16:11.220]  We've got a 25 year old young lady with an associate's degree in, where are we?
[16:11.220 --> 16:12.740]  Digital marketing and business management.
[16:12.740 --> 16:16.860]  So we've got a couple of great areas of focus that could both be of great use in the cannabis
[16:16.860 --> 16:21.900]  industry, but they want to get into the cannabis industry and they're looking for ways to get
[16:21.900 --> 16:23.580]  in and a good start.
[16:23.580 --> 16:27.300]  I think just because I know you and we've been in this industry for a while, we're going
[16:27.300 --> 16:29.340]  to have very similar advice.
[16:29.340 --> 16:34.660]  I don't know that this listener is going to appreciate the kind of bad news sort of that
[16:35.260 --> 16:36.500]  we've got to give them.
[16:36.500 --> 16:40.740]  The cannabis space is so tight right now.
[16:40.740 --> 16:48.340]  I mean, even before COVID, um, but the federal tax burden is ridiculous.
[16:48.340 --> 16:53.660]  And so a lot of the, the wiggle room financially in the industry is not there.
[16:53.660 --> 17:02.820]  Um, and so positions like digital media managers don't really exist like they should in an
[17:02.820 --> 17:04.220]  industry this large.
[17:04.420 --> 17:04.700]  Right.
[17:04.700 --> 17:09.380]  You have to get with one of the larger chain dispensaries to get something like that.
[17:10.060 --> 17:15.740]  Or the other option that I was sitting here thinking about as you were talking is, uh,
[17:16.420 --> 17:24.980]  find a business that you respect that, uh, or you're interested in working with anyway,
[17:25.020 --> 17:31.780]  that's smaller and could use the skills you've just learned, um, but doesn't know that yet
[17:31.980 --> 17:33.500]  and get on with them.
[17:33.540 --> 17:42.060]  And, um, as you develop a reputation with them, let them know, like, look, I can help
[17:42.060 --> 17:48.980]  you, um, expand your business a couple of different ways by doing ABCD and move up that
[17:48.980 --> 17:49.260]  way.
[17:49.780 --> 17:51.740]  So that's sort of the route that I was going to take.
[17:51.740 --> 17:54.300]  That's why I said we may have slightly bad news.
[17:54.580 --> 17:59.060]  I always say that the way to get your foot into this industry is to start at the entry
[17:59.060 --> 17:59.340]  level.
[17:59.340 --> 18:01.700]  If you're in the cultivation side, that's a tremor.
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.540]  If you're in this true for this industry, this person, it sounds like they want to be
[18:05.540 --> 18:06.500]  on the retail side.
[18:06.500 --> 18:08.420]  They're not in the cultivation interest area.
[18:08.420 --> 18:10.780]  They want to be in the, uh, the normal people's side.
[18:10.780 --> 18:12.580]  They don't want to be on the savage side of the business.
[18:12.940 --> 18:18.540]  So I'm thinking they may have to enter as a bud tender or something as that nature,
[18:18.540 --> 18:21.940]  because there are very few tiers in this industry.
[18:21.940 --> 18:27.420]  It's like bud tender and then lead bud tender or manager and then fucking manager.
[18:27.780 --> 18:31.860]  And then if you get with one of the chains, which there aren't many of, but if you get
[18:31.860 --> 18:35.820]  with one of the chains, then you have more like the executive managers and the more
[18:35.820 --> 18:39.460]  managers spread out regional managers, quality control people.
[18:39.460 --> 18:43.500]  But there are a lot of positions available, but you're going to have to start probably
[18:43.500 --> 18:45.020]  toward the bottom of the food chain.
[18:45.220 --> 18:50.700]  Like Mike said, get in there as a bud tender, get in there as some sort of small time rep
[18:50.700 --> 18:54.140]  or something, and then work your way up to where you just got to earn your spot.
[18:54.140 --> 18:56.540]  There are so many people here trying to do this.
[18:56.580 --> 18:57.820]  The degrees are going to help.
[18:58.260 --> 19:01.660]  Also the degrees Mike has noticed Mike has got college degrees.
[19:01.900 --> 19:05.500]  How many jobs do you get turned down for because you're simply overqualified?
[19:06.020 --> 19:11.540]  About 80% of the interviews I've been on here, they're like, we'd love to hire you, but
[19:11.540 --> 19:15.420]  we don't even want to make you an offer right now because we know we can't pay you what
[19:15.420 --> 19:21.620]  you're worth. And we feel like to offer you what we have to offer right now would be a
[19:21.620 --> 19:23.740]  kick in the dick. So we're just not going to offer it at all.
[19:23.740 --> 19:24.940]  And it's like, dude, I'm fucking here.
[19:24.940 --> 19:25.820]  Just throw me an offer.
[19:25.940 --> 19:27.180]  Let me have a damn job.
[19:27.180 --> 19:29.580]  Shit. But yeah, unfortunately, that's the way it works.
[19:29.580 --> 19:30.420]  So this person.
[19:30.860 --> 19:31.900]  That can be a thing.
[19:32.300 --> 19:36.300]  Yeah. Some of the chain people may be looking for exactly what you're doing.
[19:36.300 --> 19:40.460]  Like Mike said, some of the mom and pop shops are looking for you and don't even know
[19:40.460 --> 19:43.060]  that they need that. So you could start off as a bud tender.
[19:43.180 --> 19:46.780]  You may have to bite the bullet, start at the bottom and then show them that you show
[19:46.780 --> 19:48.780]  up to work every single day on time.
[19:48.780 --> 19:49.860]  You look professional.
[19:49.980 --> 19:52.420]  You don't ever have a hangover and smell like alcohol.
[19:52.420 --> 19:53.940]  You don't make fucking excuses.
[19:54.180 --> 19:56.740]  Like those are the people we don't give advances to.
[19:56.740 --> 19:59.300]  So show them that you can keep up, that you can catch up.
[19:59.500 --> 20:00.740]  Show them that you're part of the team.
[20:00.740 --> 20:01.860]  Show them that you're qualified.
[20:01.860 --> 20:05.060]  Then once we know that you can do all that stuff, we'll give you an opportunity to do
[20:05.060 --> 20:06.020]  more, make more.
[20:06.180 --> 20:07.260]  Then you become management.
[20:07.260 --> 20:08.620]  Then you become assistant management.
[20:08.620 --> 20:10.340]  Then you become all the other things above that.
[20:10.340 --> 20:14.700]  It takes steps. So don't don't have too much hope that you're going to come in and
[20:14.700 --> 20:16.420]  just start right up at the top.
[20:16.420 --> 20:17.860]  That would be ideal. That would be awesome.
[20:17.860 --> 20:19.420]  But I don't want to put your hopes up.
[20:20.020 --> 20:21.580]  You say digital marketing.
[20:21.860 --> 20:22.900]  There is a need for that.
[20:22.900 --> 20:27.620]  Unfortunately, that's also another position's job, like their side job.
[20:27.860 --> 20:30.780]  Like that's one of the other managers is what they do when they're not other
[20:30.780 --> 20:32.620]  managing is kind of how it handles.
[20:32.620 --> 20:33.820]  It's handled in this industry.
[20:33.940 --> 20:36.380]  Marketing's tough in this space.
[20:36.380 --> 20:43.580]  Also, we're banned from advertising on most major platforms in a lot of ways,
[20:43.580 --> 20:47.140]  similar to alcohol or tobacco advertising, more tobacco than alcohol.
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.980]  In Colorado, it's even more restrictive.
[20:53.140 --> 20:57.740]  Anything we advertise in has to be somehow verifiable.
[20:58.100 --> 21:02.820]  I can't remember what the percentage is, but X percent over 21 readership.
[21:03.340 --> 21:04.540]  I think it's 70 percent.
[21:06.460 --> 21:09.620]  We have to be really careful how and what we advertise.
[21:09.620 --> 21:17.100]  And when parts of the industry fuck that up, the backlash is instant and brutal.
[21:18.100 --> 21:21.100]  So, yeah, be wary of the advertiser.
[21:21.100 --> 21:24.460]  Most businesses are very wary of how and what they advertise.
[21:24.740 --> 21:28.140]  Yeah, you don't even see a lot of dispensaries on social media anymore.
[21:28.300 --> 21:31.860]  They're mostly just on weed maps is the only way you can really find a dispensary
[21:31.900 --> 21:34.980]  where they've got a website if they're real savvy and they keep the website updated.
[21:36.020 --> 21:40.820]  Well, some of that's getting tossed from platforms, but a lot of it is they don't
[21:40.820 --> 21:46.140]  want to end up on 9 News because they had a cookie monster on the side of their
[21:46.140 --> 21:47.140]  building. Yeah.
[21:47.380 --> 21:53.500]  Yeah. Like simple faux pas that I mean, no one saw coming until they were done and
[21:53.500 --> 21:54.940]  they're like, oh, fuck, what have we done?
[21:55.220 --> 21:57.700]  We put Mickey Mouse smoking a blunt on the side of our building.
[21:57.700 --> 21:58.700]  Oh, shit.
[22:00.940 --> 22:02.580]  All right, prospect, I hope we helped you out.
[22:02.580 --> 22:05.860]  I know that may not have been the answer you're looking for, but it was honest and
[22:05.860 --> 22:08.860]  it's the truth. You may have to start at the bottom and work your way up.
[22:08.860 --> 22:11.220]  Unfortunately, that is the way this industry works.
[22:11.700 --> 22:13.020]  And also, you got to know somebody here.
[22:13.020 --> 22:16.820]  Unfortunately, I hate to say that, but it's not what you know, it's fucking who you
[22:16.820 --> 22:18.380]  know right now in the cannabis industry.
[22:18.620 --> 22:22.180]  So that'll help. Maybe they can make some friends, start networking online.
[22:22.420 --> 22:27.260]  Also, here's a good tip. Go to all of the Sinti Night and all of the whatever other
[22:27.260 --> 22:29.940]  type of networking cannabis events there are.
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.580]  Yeah. Go to those.
[22:31.660 --> 22:32.820]  Show that you can speak.
[22:32.820 --> 22:33.980]  Show that you're well-dressed.
[22:33.980 --> 22:35.060]  Show that you're professional.
[22:35.060 --> 22:38.620]  Show that you can walk in with a business card and shake a hand and say, this is me.
[22:38.620 --> 22:39.860]  I'm the person for the job.
[22:40.020 --> 22:41.380]  That would really help out also.
[22:41.380 --> 22:42.420]  That's a good suggestion.
[22:44.020 --> 22:44.540]  All right.
[22:44.540 --> 22:50.100]  If you were able to land to the two degrees, you're going to be able to land a job in the
[22:50.100 --> 22:54.100]  cannabis space. It just might take you a while to build it up to the one you want.
[22:54.300 --> 22:56.340]  Yeah. Denver's expensive.
[22:56.340 --> 22:57.460]  Pueblo's affordable.
[22:57.740 --> 22:58.780]  Look into where you're moving.
[22:59.220 --> 23:00.620]  Be prepared for that sort of stuff.
[23:00.940 --> 23:04.380]  The locations you listed, none of them sounded local.
[23:04.380 --> 23:06.260]  So you've got some options.
[23:06.260 --> 23:09.660]  There are a lot of legal and medical cannabis states out there.
[23:10.660 --> 23:14.780]  If you're going to relocate, take the time and pick the space you want to locate to.
[23:15.500 --> 23:18.100]  Very true. Don't just jump or do whatever.
[23:18.100 --> 23:19.500]  So a lot of people just end up here.
[23:20.180 --> 23:21.260]  Yeah. All right.
[23:21.420 --> 23:22.580]  We do have another email.
[23:22.780 --> 23:23.980]  Shout out to our friend Prospect.
[23:23.980 --> 23:25.620]  I hope you and your daughter do very well.
[23:25.980 --> 23:27.100]  Good luck in college.
[23:27.340 --> 23:30.180]  Good luck in life. And I look forward to hearing from you again in the future.
[23:30.180 --> 23:32.500]  If anybody else out there has an email, send me an email.
[23:32.500 --> 23:37.220]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:37.380 --> 23:38.500]  All right. We've got another message.
[23:38.500 --> 23:39.540]  I'm going to jump right into it.
[23:39.820 --> 23:43.420]  It says, Rasta Jeff, you can use my name on the show.
[23:43.420 --> 23:44.820]  Big shout out to our friend, Brendan.
[23:45.060 --> 23:46.700]  His message goes like this.
[23:46.780 --> 23:48.500]  Shout out to you during these times.
[23:48.500 --> 23:56.100]  Your positive vibrations and words of wisdom about the virus and about the quarantine life are uplifting, educational, and should not make anyone fearful.
[23:56.460 --> 23:59.740]  But with the loss of ignorance comes the loss of bliss, I guess.
[23:59.740 --> 24:02.060]  That is a really great opening line.
[24:02.060 --> 24:02.340]  Wow.
[24:02.940 --> 24:04.700]  Man, thank you for all of that.
[24:04.700 --> 24:05.860]  That's a lot to digest.
[24:05.900 --> 24:06.900]  Huge compliment. Thank you.
[24:07.220 --> 24:09.220]  I'm about to do a run of iRestrain.
[24:09.260 --> 24:15.260]  I was wondering about the height and stretch differences between Lemon Jeffrey, Golden Goat S1, and the Cream.
[24:15.260 --> 24:19.180]  Should I be aware of any major differences in feeds for these strains?
[24:19.180 --> 24:22.860]  I'm going to stop right there and say the Lemon Jeffrey is going to get taller than everybody else.
[24:23.420 --> 24:26.060]  You may be prepared for a stretchier, lankier plant.
[24:26.820 --> 24:28.740]  That may be the problem in the room.
[24:29.180 --> 24:30.420]  That's why I named it after me.
[24:31.380 --> 24:33.060]  So be prepared. That one's a little bit different.
[24:33.460 --> 24:35.060]  The other two will play well together.
[24:35.460 --> 24:36.980]  It says, should I be aware of any differences?
[24:36.980 --> 24:40.780]  Also, is the Cream typically Indica or Sativa leaning phenotypically?
[24:40.780 --> 24:41.980]  It's right in the middle, bro.
[24:41.980 --> 24:43.140]  That's why it's so awesome.
[24:43.460 --> 24:47.860]  It's got that head-wrecking Sativa, and then it's also got that couch-lock Indica to it.
[24:48.340 --> 24:49.580]  It's fucking beautiful.
[24:49.580 --> 24:52.740]  The Cookies and Cream, Two Arise, it was a beautiful combo.
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.500]  It comes out just about 50-50, bro.
[24:55.260 --> 25:00.540]  It goes on to say, the reason I run multiple strains is the personal need for a little bit of variation in my medicine.
[25:00.580 --> 25:03.060]  Yes, variety is the spice of life.
[25:03.060 --> 25:04.460]  I completely agree with that.
[25:04.700 --> 25:10.060]  As long as you can dial in those strains and pay good attention to them and give them the attention they need,
[25:10.060 --> 25:13.540]  I think they'll run well together other than that Lemon Jeffrey.
[25:13.940 --> 25:14.620]  Excuse me. Sorry.
[25:14.620 --> 25:16.860]  The Lemon Jeffrey will get a little bit tall on you.
[25:17.100 --> 25:18.620]  It'll go really fast.
[25:19.140 --> 25:20.820]  Let's see. Where am I in the email?
[25:20.820 --> 25:25.300]  I'm really looking forward to growing some beautiful herb bred by a positive force like yourself.
[25:25.300 --> 25:26.780]  Big respect. I appreciate that.
[25:26.980 --> 25:28.180]  I hope the grow goes well.
[25:28.420 --> 25:31.620]  It says, I appreciate any insight you're able to give me on these strains.
[25:31.620 --> 25:35.500]  Keep producing the fire, both through podcasts and genetics.
[25:35.700 --> 25:38.020]  Much love from Brendan.
[25:39.220 --> 25:39.540]  All right.
[25:39.540 --> 25:42.220]  So the Lemon Jeffrey and the Golden Goat will grow well together.
[25:42.220 --> 25:44.060]  The Lemon Jeffrey is going to get a little bit bigger.
[25:44.500 --> 25:45.980]  The Cream will fit in there.
[25:46.500 --> 25:50.540]  They're all going to take about the same amount of time to finish, so that's not too big of a deal.
[25:50.780 --> 25:54.020]  The thing I'm concerned with is that Lemon Jeffrey is going to get a little bit tall.
[25:54.020 --> 25:57.140]  You ask if I have any tips for growing these strains.
[25:57.140 --> 26:00.980]  I have done full podcast episodes on all three of these strains.
[26:01.900 --> 26:03.660]  Definitely check out those shows.
[26:03.660 --> 26:09.540]  Yeah, it's like 30 to 45 minutes just full on giving you tips about how to care for that strain and what to look for.
[26:09.540 --> 26:14.740]  If you go to YouTube, go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast channel, click on my playlists.
[26:15.100 --> 26:17.500]  There is a playlist called strain descriptions.
[26:17.500 --> 26:20.380]  These descriptions will be in that playlist.
[26:20.380 --> 26:21.540]  You'll be able to listen to these.
[26:21.980 --> 26:23.540]  You'll be able to get all kinds of good tips.
[26:23.540 --> 26:27.900]  Anybody else out there, if you're interested in those strains, I highly recommend the strain descriptions.
[26:28.140 --> 26:31.980]  If you're growing some iRegenetics stuff, you can learn a lot from those podcasts.
[26:31.980 --> 26:34.340]  I know that not all of the strains are up there.
[26:34.340 --> 26:35.620]  It takes a minute to do them.
[26:35.620 --> 26:36.380]  I will do more.
[26:36.380 --> 26:38.980]  I've got another email requesting two strain descriptions.
[26:38.980 --> 26:42.980]  I'm going to knock them out in the same episode because those strains won't be made anymore.
[26:42.980 --> 26:45.020]  I'm just going to put them to rest in that show.
[26:45.260 --> 26:48.380]  Then the last few seeds will sell out and we could give it a kiss goodbye.
[26:48.780 --> 26:51.780]  But Brendan, I think you will have a successful grow.
[26:51.780 --> 26:53.300]  Just pay attention to that Lemon Jeffrey.
[26:53.300 --> 26:54.940]  Be ready for it to get kind of tall.
[26:54.940 --> 26:57.740]  I'm not sure which phenotypes you have got of each plant.
[26:57.740 --> 27:02.700]  Maybe you've got a tall, stretchy phenotype of Lemon Jeffrey and a squatty phenotype of Golden Goat.
[27:02.700 --> 27:03.900]  Maybe you've got the opposite.
[27:04.140 --> 27:08.140]  It's hard to predict that, but I know that generally the Jeffrey will get taller.
[27:08.700 --> 27:10.860]  Then you go on to say you appreciate any insights.
[27:10.860 --> 27:12.660]  Again, I say check out those podcasts.
[27:12.660 --> 27:14.740]  You wrap it up with keep producing the fire.
[27:15.020 --> 27:15.540]  Thank you, bro.
[27:15.540 --> 27:20.260]  I'm glad that you feel that the show is fire and I'm glad that you feel the genetics are fire.
[27:20.460 --> 27:23.340]  And also you give me a lot of shout out for my positive attitude.
[27:23.340 --> 27:24.100]  So thank you, bro.
[27:24.220 --> 27:25.300]  I'm glad that you're seeing that.
[27:25.300 --> 27:26.380]  I'm glad that it's noticed.
[27:26.780 --> 27:30.380]  We got to keep a positive attitude in these weird times because shit is weird.
[27:30.380 --> 27:32.060]  We need some sort of relief and entertainment.
[27:32.260 --> 27:35.300]  It wouldn't do you any good if I came on here and just cried about my problems.
[27:35.300 --> 27:35.940]  You got your own.
[27:35.940 --> 27:37.860]  So I'm here to lift you up, make you feel better.
[27:38.100 --> 27:38.780]  Jah love.
[27:39.060 --> 27:39.540]  All right, buddy.
[27:39.540 --> 27:40.540]  Thank you for the message.
[27:40.740 --> 27:43.820]  Again, if anybody else out there has an email, I would love to hear from you.
[27:43.820 --> 27:48.180]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:48.940 --> 27:50.380]  Mike, we can start wrapping up the show.
[27:50.380 --> 27:52.300]  But before we do, I gave you some homework.
[27:52.300 --> 27:54.820]  I said that a listener sent me an email.
[27:55.180 --> 28:00.460]  On the last episode, Mike mentioned that his wife mixed up some magical hand
[28:00.460 --> 28:03.860]  sanitizer from two products and a listener was very curious.
[28:03.860 --> 28:07.220]  So they sent us an email saying, Hey, what was that combination that your wife
[28:07.220 --> 28:07.780]  put together?
[28:07.940 --> 28:08.780]  Wasn't my wife.
[28:08.780 --> 28:09.700]  That was Mike's wife.
[28:09.940 --> 28:13.180]  So I, my wife, I gave Mike some homework.
[28:13.340 --> 28:15.780]  Uh, Mike, can you tell us how to make that hand sanitizer?
[28:15.780 --> 28:16.540]  We were talking about.
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.180]  I can't prepare it.
[28:20.180 --> 28:21.340]  I did my homeworks.
[28:22.340 --> 28:22.780]  All right.
[28:22.780 --> 28:27.060]  So you're going to want to get out whatever your end container is.
[28:27.780 --> 28:28.580]  Gather up.
[28:28.700 --> 28:31.500]  Uh, we used isopropyl alcohol.
[28:31.580 --> 28:35.700]  Um, you can use any alcohol that's over 60% alcohol by volume.
[28:36.620 --> 28:42.460]  Um, so if you've got a high octane vodka or whatever, you can also use that.
[28:42.500 --> 28:43.820]  I wouldn't recommend it.
[28:43.940 --> 28:45.260]  We used isopropyl alcohol.
[28:46.060 --> 28:48.580]  Um, don't waste drinking hooch.
[28:48.700 --> 28:48.980]  Yeah.
[28:48.980 --> 28:49.780]  In a pandemic.
[28:49.860 --> 28:50.700]  Don't use booze.
[28:51.300 --> 28:57.020]  Um, but, uh, two parts alcohol, as long as the alcohol is 60% or better.
[28:57.620 --> 29:03.500]  Um, the higher, the proof alcohol, the better you can get the consistency of the,
[29:04.860 --> 29:07.140]  um, the emulsion.
[29:07.660 --> 29:08.020]  Yeah.
[29:08.060 --> 29:08.540]  Thank you.
[29:08.580 --> 29:14.220]  Uh, it'll be real runny if your alcohol isn't high enough proof to add extra
[29:14.220 --> 29:14.820]  aloe vera.
[29:15.340 --> 29:15.620]  Okay.
[29:15.660 --> 29:20.860]  Um, and, uh, you want to do two parts alcohol to one part aloe vera gel.
[29:21.340 --> 29:25.340]  Um, you want the alcohol to be 60% or better by volume and you want the aloe
[29:25.340 --> 29:26.780]  vera gel to be a hundred percent.
[29:27.700 --> 29:33.060]  Um, any sort of cutting to the aloe vera gel, make it real runny in your hands too.
[29:33.820 --> 29:37.980]  Um, and then just add whatever, um, essential oils for sense.
[29:38.820 --> 29:42.260]  And so the wife picked a couple that she thought were good for the skin.
[29:42.940 --> 29:45.140]  Um, she's really into the essential oils.
[29:45.260 --> 29:45.620]  All right.
[29:46.820 --> 29:50.780]  Um, we use a lot of that stuff with the kids, maybe a tea tree and a lavender.
[29:51.260 --> 29:54.860]  Uh, she did tea tree lavender and I can't remember what the third one was.
[29:54.860 --> 29:56.260]  And my niece did citrus.
[29:57.260 --> 29:57.540]  Yeah.
[29:57.660 --> 30:00.300]  See, I'm good with turps, bro.
[30:00.900 --> 30:01.140]  Yep.
[30:01.460 --> 30:03.140]  Um, and it works pretty good.
[30:03.140 --> 30:11.340]  We got, uh, man, we got some hand sanitizer online that, uh, it works just
[30:11.340 --> 30:14.540]  fine and the consistency is just fine, but holy fuck, does it stink?
[30:15.060 --> 30:18.420]  And the homemade stuff, I like the consistency a little bit better
[30:18.780 --> 30:19.740]  and it smells wonderful.
[30:19.780 --> 30:20.260]  So cool.
[30:20.540 --> 30:21.020]  Way better.
[30:21.060 --> 30:21.780]  And it's a project.
[30:21.780 --> 30:24.020]  People can save some money and they got something to do while they're stuck at
[30:24.020 --> 30:24.220]  home.
[30:24.260 --> 30:27.100]  She had so much fun making it and it doesn't take that long at all.
[30:27.100 --> 30:31.380]  You just throw two parts out, call the one part of aloe vera, you mix and then
[30:31.380 --> 30:32.620]  put some, bam, you're done.
[30:32.860 --> 30:34.100]  Sent drops in the containers.
[30:34.100 --> 30:35.740]  Once you separate it and you're ready to rock.
[30:36.020 --> 30:36.660]  That sounds fun.
[30:37.420 --> 30:37.580]  Yep.
[30:37.620 --> 30:39.220]  That's real simple recipe folks.
[30:40.220 --> 30:44.100]  Um, remember that, uh, ice probe alcohol is flammable, so don't do this in your
[30:44.140 --> 30:44.620]  open flame.
[30:44.860 --> 30:44.980]  Yeah.
[30:44.980 --> 30:46.340]  Don't, don't do it while you're dabbing.
[30:46.900 --> 30:47.140]  Yep.
[30:47.580 --> 30:49.940]  Put the torch down first or do whatever.
[30:50.340 --> 30:54.100]  Or the cigarette or the, the stove or whatever.
[30:54.540 --> 30:54.820]  Oh yeah.
[30:54.820 --> 30:56.500]  Don't do it in the kitchen while you're making ramen.
[30:57.260 --> 30:57.580]  Yep.
[30:57.900 --> 30:58.180]  Yeah.
[30:58.220 --> 30:58.500]  Okay.
[30:58.500 --> 30:58.940]  I get through.
[30:59.300 --> 30:59.540]  Yeah.
[30:59.540 --> 31:02.420]  Through just a little bit when you're working with flammables.
[31:03.020 --> 31:03.260]  Yeah.
[31:03.340 --> 31:06.380]  You know, uh, Hey Mike, thank you for joining me, bro.
[31:06.380 --> 31:07.420]  This was a good podcast.
[31:08.420 --> 31:09.340]  Wonderful podcast.
[31:09.340 --> 31:10.940]  I'm loving the zoom format listeners.
[31:10.940 --> 31:11.700]  Let us know what you like.
[31:11.700 --> 31:12.740]  Think of the zoom format.
[31:13.220 --> 31:13.420]  Yeah.
[31:13.460 --> 31:16.260]  More bunker sessions, more bunker sessions, bro.
[31:16.260 --> 31:17.460]  More of two guys coughing.
[31:17.900 --> 31:19.100]  Uh, you can just show up.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.100]  You don't have to drive over.
[31:20.140 --> 31:20.700]  It's kind of cool.
[31:20.700 --> 31:21.460]  You're like, Hey, you're ready.
[31:21.500 --> 31:24.100]  I'm like, I'm ready to use that extra hour for recording.
[31:24.380 --> 31:24.620]  Yeah.
[31:24.660 --> 31:25.380]  It's kind of nice.
[31:25.660 --> 31:28.300]  Of course we do sit here for like 30 minutes and take dabs before we even
[31:28.300 --> 31:31.020]  bothered to press record, but that's just two guys coughing.
[31:31.220 --> 31:34.340]  We did that when I had to drive across town to do this show.
[31:34.660 --> 31:35.220]  Very true.
[31:35.580 --> 31:39.060]  I think it takes, it's a minimum of three dabs before we can record.
[31:39.820 --> 31:40.100]  Yep.
[31:40.340 --> 31:44.500]  Do we, uh, do we want to wrap this show up or do we want to ramble
[31:44.500 --> 31:45.620]  at them for a little while longer?
[31:46.020 --> 31:47.020]  Uh, what do you got, bro?
[31:47.020 --> 31:48.460]  It sounds like you might have something to say.
[31:48.940 --> 31:50.060]  I don't got a damn thing.
[31:50.260 --> 31:51.380]  Oh, well then don't tease them.
[31:51.460 --> 31:54.420]  I was going to say the rumor is that we get to go out and play
[31:54.420 --> 31:55.420]  again in a couple of days.
[31:55.420 --> 31:57.980]  They're going to lift the stay at home orders here for us.
[31:59.220 --> 32:00.260]  In a tiered way.
[32:00.260 --> 32:02.140]  That's going to annoy the fuck out of the people.
[32:02.620 --> 32:02.900]  Right.
[32:02.900 --> 32:04.220]  But are you ready to go back out?
[32:04.860 --> 32:06.140]  Are you ready to go back out anyway?
[32:06.140 --> 32:06.940]  It was my question.
[32:07.220 --> 32:10.620]  Honestly, I've been trying for the last couple of days to avoid.
[32:11.820 --> 32:13.460]  Social media a little bit.
[32:13.500 --> 32:18.580]  I, uh, I went down the reopen now Facebook group rabbit hole,
[32:18.580 --> 32:20.380]  which I do not recommend.
[32:21.260 --> 32:24.940]  Um, even if you currently would love it for the state to be
[32:24.940 --> 32:29.220]  instantly reopened fully tomorrow, don't go down that rabbit hole.
[32:29.220 --> 32:29.980]  It's not fun.
[32:29.980 --> 32:35.620]  It's it's like the worst of humanity boiled down into a fine putrid sludge.
[32:36.420 --> 32:39.700]  And I've avoided all of those groups and most of that stuff.
[32:40.140 --> 32:41.620]  I should have, I shouldn't have looked.
[32:41.700 --> 32:44.300]  And then once I started looking, I couldn't look away.
[32:44.540 --> 32:44.980]  Yeah.
[32:45.100 --> 32:45.300]  Yeah.
[32:45.300 --> 32:48.180]  And I, I catch myself scrolling through stuff and I go, oh, I forgot.
[32:48.220 --> 32:48.980]  I don't care.
[32:49.300 --> 32:50.380]  Like I totally forgot that.
[32:50.380 --> 32:50.940]  I don't care.
[32:50.940 --> 32:54.500]  I'll ammo and like put boards over the windows more than when I'm reading that
[32:54.500 --> 32:54.900]  shit.
[32:55.620 --> 33:02.580]  But, uh, uh, I think the, I'm mostly ready to go back out.
[33:02.900 --> 33:06.780]  Like, I don't know if the smart people are right.
[33:07.340 --> 33:10.740]  Um, I've got people in my life I need to not go out for, like, I
[33:10.740 --> 33:11.660]  don't want to get them sick.
[33:12.020 --> 33:12.260]  Yup.
[33:12.540 --> 33:14.660]  Um, I don't want that hanging over me.
[33:15.060 --> 33:20.780]  Um, but yeah, I tend to listen to the smart, smartest people in the room.
[33:20.780 --> 33:24.780]  If, if the smart people in class think it's a good idea, we stay home on the dry.
[33:25.180 --> 33:25.380]  Yeah.
[33:25.380 --> 33:29.660]  And it was, it can't be that bad if you're just staying at home, it's better
[33:29.660 --> 33:31.620]  than fucking a lot of other options.
[33:31.700 --> 33:32.700]  So yeah.
[33:32.740 --> 33:33.540]  And I'm good at it, dude.
[33:33.540 --> 33:37.860]  I've been, I, like I've said before, gamers, we have such an advantage here.
[33:39.540 --> 33:42.500]  Like we're fucking shut ins long before shut ins were cool.
[33:42.780 --> 33:43.100]  Yeah.
[33:43.340 --> 33:43.620]  Yeah.
[33:44.860 --> 33:47.380]  It's like all you bitches at level one and stayed inside.
[33:47.380 --> 33:48.580]  We're level 80 already.
[33:48.580 --> 33:50.500]  Like we were here since the shit was beta.
[33:50.500 --> 33:54.340]  Yo, I could use a, this may sound really crazy, but I could use a visit to the
[33:54.340 --> 33:57.380]  dreadlock lady, the person who works on my dreads.
[33:57.380 --> 34:00.820]  Cause I'm looking like a shaggy dog up top, but as long as I keep the hat on,
[34:01.820 --> 34:04.100]  quarantine hasn't gotten to me as long as I keep the hat on.
[34:04.100 --> 34:07.700]  You can't tell as you over there scratching your kind of beard.
[34:07.940 --> 34:09.460]  This isn't going to be a video podcast.
[34:10.500 --> 34:10.820]  Yeah.
[34:10.940 --> 34:12.540]  Um, yeah.
[34:12.540 --> 34:18.340]  Listeners for just to waste more audio time for your, your afternoon where I'm
[34:18.340 --> 34:21.740]  growing a shitty beard during quarantine and see how long this keeps up.
[34:21.980 --> 34:24.180]  He's not joking when he says a shitty beard.
[34:25.380 --> 34:28.300]  My people were not gifted with, with good facial hair.
[34:28.540 --> 34:31.660]  You know, the, uh, the Etch A Sketch face or the guy with the face that you put
[34:31.660 --> 34:32.700]  the magnet beard on.
[34:33.620 --> 34:38.620]  I've never sympathized with a character more than in Joe dirt when he's trying
[34:38.620 --> 34:41.380]  to describe that his facial hair just grows all white trashy.
[34:41.940 --> 34:43.380]  Um, cause mine does too.
[34:43.500 --> 34:45.420]  Super bad, super bad.
[34:45.980 --> 34:46.100]  Yeah.
[34:46.100 --> 34:47.460]  It is, it is going crazy.
[34:47.900 --> 34:48.220]  Yup.
[34:49.220 --> 34:51.860]  It's a solidarity beard with a relative of mine.
[34:51.860 --> 34:55.180]  Who's being, who got talked into growing one.
[34:55.860 --> 34:58.260]  I'm not sure how long the kids actually fucking hate it.
[34:58.300 --> 35:00.380]  They say it's they go, dad, you're scratchy.
[35:00.780 --> 35:01.140]  Oh yeah.
[35:01.140 --> 35:05.020]  And if, if I shave before the other person, it will be because my kids
[35:05.020 --> 35:05.780]  convinced me to.
[35:06.660 --> 35:10.140]  So this episode won't be a video episode, so nobody can see what we're talking
[35:10.140 --> 35:14.100]  about, but I think the next episode with myself solo will be a video and I'm going
[35:14.100 --> 35:16.940]  to try to get more people on zoom to do more video episodes with me.
[35:17.380 --> 35:18.060]  Uh, I did it.
[35:18.060 --> 35:20.340]  That's trying to talk me into doing video shows guys.
[35:20.380 --> 35:21.380]  That's where I was headed with this.
[35:21.380 --> 35:25.980]  We're going to bombard Mike with inbox messages, convincing him to do some video
[35:25.980 --> 35:26.300]  shows.
[35:26.300 --> 35:29.100]  If we need to buy him a tapestry for the background and some shit like that, we'll
[35:29.100 --> 35:31.060]  use the Patreon funding to get him that set up.
[35:31.660 --> 35:33.380]  Uh, but we got to get Mike on video.
[35:33.380 --> 35:35.860]  Cause I think the people will enjoy the video show.
[35:36.180 --> 35:38.700]  We just got to back you up about six more inches from the camera.
[35:38.700 --> 35:39.940]  So you don't look like you're trying to eat it.
[35:39.980 --> 35:40.260]  Yeah.
[35:40.300 --> 35:42.300]  See, see, it looks like civilized human back.
[35:42.300 --> 35:43.980]  I have to hold the microphone now.
[35:44.220 --> 35:45.020]  Uh, we'll look at you.
[35:45.060 --> 35:47.500]  Well, I'll give you one of these Mike stance or close to your face.
[35:47.500 --> 35:49.580]  If we could just push the camera back a little bit.
[35:49.860 --> 35:52.100]  Well, they can't see it now, but yeah.
[35:52.100 --> 35:53.140]  See, how's that buddy?
[35:53.340 --> 35:53.740]  Yeah.
[35:53.820 --> 35:54.060]  No.
[35:54.100 --> 35:55.260]  See, now you're looking way better.
[35:55.580 --> 35:56.460]  Now we can see you.
[35:56.500 --> 35:57.060]  Yeah.
[35:57.700 --> 35:58.660]  We'll get you lined up, bro.
[35:58.660 --> 36:01.220]  We're going to get Mike on video so that people can fucking see him and then we
[36:01.220 --> 36:02.140]  can do this video show.
[36:02.140 --> 36:02.900]  I can't see the table.
[36:02.900 --> 36:05.100]  The PCs propped up on.
[36:05.180 --> 36:05.500]  Yeah.
[36:05.500 --> 36:05.740]  Dirty.
[36:05.740 --> 36:06.140]  You look good.
[36:06.140 --> 36:07.540]  You almost look like, you know what you're doing.
[36:08.300 --> 36:10.980]  We'll get you a little tapestry to put in the background, hide all the play
[36:10.980 --> 36:12.420]  pen and all the other craziness.
[36:13.500 --> 36:14.100]  There's no playpen.
[36:14.100 --> 36:15.220]  I'm just kidding.
[36:15.820 --> 36:18.340]  I was going to say bondage gear, but playpen sounded better.
[36:19.740 --> 36:20.020]  Yeah.
[36:20.020 --> 36:21.580]  I got all the toys out of my office.
[36:21.580 --> 36:24.100]  So at least it's not full of like little kid shit right now.
[36:24.220 --> 36:24.420]  Yeah.
[36:24.420 --> 36:25.460]  It looks, it looks more civil.
[36:25.460 --> 36:27.060]  Coloring books and fire trucks.
[36:28.180 --> 36:29.020]  Uh, yeah.
[36:30.660 --> 36:31.860]  Our days are so different.
[36:32.700 --> 36:33.180]  Yup.
[36:34.020 --> 36:35.220]  Uh, Mike, what else do you got for us?
[36:35.220 --> 36:36.420]  It was your idea to ramble on.
[36:36.420 --> 36:39.060]  So, uh, you've got to have something to carry this show for the
[36:39.060 --> 36:40.300]  next three to five minutes.
[36:41.300 --> 36:44.700]  Uh, just, I know everything's weird right now.
[36:44.740 --> 36:45.820]  Everybody just stay cool.
[36:46.260 --> 36:49.980]  Just roll up another dupe, pack another bowl, throw another dab.
[36:51.260 --> 36:52.740]  And just enjoy life, man.
[36:53.140 --> 36:54.620]  Government wants to pay to stay home.
[36:54.620 --> 36:55.940]  If you can fucking do it, do it.
[36:56.260 --> 36:56.980]  It sounds perfect.
[36:56.980 --> 36:58.780]  Just roll one up.
[36:59.300 --> 37:00.060]  Shoot me a DM.
[37:00.060 --> 37:01.940]  If you're bored, I can tweet at me.
[37:01.980 --> 37:02.820]  Tweeted Jeff.
[37:03.260 --> 37:03.940]  How did they tweet at you?
[37:03.940 --> 37:06.700]  Mike, call your mom and say, Hey mom, I miss you.
[37:07.300 --> 37:07.540]  Yeah.
[37:07.540 --> 37:07.780]  Do that.
[37:07.780 --> 37:09.020]  You want to tweet at me?
[37:09.060 --> 37:10.780]  It's at Nemo punk 15.
[37:11.580 --> 37:14.820]  If a tweeter is not your thing and you'd rather Facebook it, you can find
[37:14.820 --> 37:17.460]  me at a Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[37:18.540 --> 37:20.540]  Um, Jeff, how would they get ahold of you?
[37:20.900 --> 37:22.300]  Look how smooth that was, Mike.
[37:22.340 --> 37:25.020]  Um, you can find me on the Instagram.
[37:25.060 --> 37:27.820]  It's a, I re underscore genetics on Twitter.
[37:27.820 --> 37:29.740]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[37:30.060 --> 37:35.260]  If you want to send me an email, it's a grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[37:35.260 --> 37:37.420]  Mike, it feels like a good spot to start wrapping it up since
[37:37.420 --> 37:38.700]  you gave me that sweet segue.
[37:38.980 --> 37:40.140]  I'm going to thank you for hanging out.
[37:41.180 --> 37:43.140]  Um, and yeah, thanks for hanging out, bro.
[37:43.140 --> 37:43.940]  I look forward to doing this.
[37:43.940 --> 37:47.020]  I'm going to try to get you on like every other episode, every third episode or so.
[37:47.020 --> 37:49.740]  Cause I know your schedule is a little bit chaotic, but we're trying to get you
[37:49.740 --> 37:50.980]  on here and more of a rhythm.
[37:50.980 --> 37:55.500]  Now we, uh, we might be able to do this a lot more frequently than, uh, we have
[37:55.500 --> 37:55.780]  been.
[37:55.980 --> 37:56.620]  Yeah.
[37:56.660 --> 37:57.980]  I'd like to get you going on video.
[37:58.020 --> 38:01.340]  You guys tweet him, sell them, get that video going for somebody, send him a
[38:01.340 --> 38:01.860]  tapestry.
[38:01.860 --> 38:04.220]  He just needs like a tapestry and a stand to hold it up.
[38:04.220 --> 38:05.980]  And then I think it'd be more comfortable with the vids.
[38:06.420 --> 38:06.780]  Yeah.
[38:08.100 --> 38:08.860]  Go to Amazon, bro.
[38:08.860 --> 38:09.300]  Pick one out.
[38:09.300 --> 38:09.860]  We'll send it to you.
