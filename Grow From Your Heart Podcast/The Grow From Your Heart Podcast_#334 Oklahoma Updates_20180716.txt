[00:08.040 --> 00:09.040]  news, education, and conversation.

[00:14.040 --> 00:18.280]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious

[00:53.620 --> 00:54.620]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:54.620 --> 00:57.360]  It's time for episode 334 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:57.360 --> 00:58.760]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:58.760 --> 01:00.700]  Sitting across the table from me is White Mike.
[01:00.740 --> 01:01.740]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[01:01.740 --> 01:02.740]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:02.740 --> 01:03.740]  Oh, man.
[01:03.740 --> 01:04.740]  Thanks for coming out, kind of doing a late night podcast.
[01:04.740 --> 01:06.660]  I'm fixing some equipment knobs as I talk.
[01:06.660 --> 01:08.900]  I apologize for that weird drop in sound.
[01:08.900 --> 01:09.900]  We'll get it going.
[01:09.900 --> 01:12.060]  Just decided that one knob needed to be turned.
[01:12.060 --> 01:13.060]  Little audio love.
[01:13.060 --> 01:15.900]  Got to make it sound good, and I'm clearing my throat right at the start of the show.
[01:15.900 --> 01:16.900]  What a professional podcast.
[01:16.900 --> 01:17.900]  Here, we'll get it right out of the way.
[01:17.900 --> 01:18.900]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[01:18.900 --> 01:19.900]  There we go.
[01:19.900 --> 01:22.240]  I think I'm better now.
[01:22.240 --> 01:26.380]  We took, it felt like a couple more dabs than we usually do before the show.
[01:26.380 --> 01:29.820]  Well, you needed that cigarette, and that, I got good and high, and then you were like,
[01:29.940 --> 01:30.940]  let's smoke a cigarette.
[01:30.940 --> 01:34.220]  We went outside and came back, and I was like, I'm not even high anymore, so we got to re-stone.
[01:34.220 --> 01:38.620]  So I think we got double dabbed, and the second session kind of re-brought that first session
[01:38.620 --> 01:39.620]  back, I feel like.
[01:39.620 --> 01:40.620]  It worked.
[01:40.620 --> 01:41.620]  Welcome to the show, you guys.
[01:41.620 --> 01:44.500]  This show is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:44.500 --> 01:48.340]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:48.340 --> 01:51.900]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:51.900 --> 01:52.900]  Support them.
[01:52.900 --> 01:53.900]  Send them our love.
[01:53.900 --> 01:54.900]  All right.
[01:54.900 --> 01:56.660]  We like to talk about what we're smoking on at the start of the show.
[01:56.660 --> 01:59.060]  Mike and I were already talking about how dabbed out we are.
[01:59.300 --> 02:05.340]  We started off by taking dabs of some Clementine HC-FSE, big old chunky diamonds with a lot
[02:05.340 --> 02:06.340]  of turps on it.
[02:06.340 --> 02:07.340]  Just delicious.
[02:07.340 --> 02:12.380]  Then we switched to some Holy Grail Kush, which was even more delicious in my opinion.
[02:12.380 --> 02:13.860]  It's because I don't smoke a lot of that.
[02:13.860 --> 02:14.860]  I was kind of spoiled with it.
[02:14.860 --> 02:15.860]  It was really nice.
[02:15.860 --> 02:18.180]  Oh, it's a really nice flavor.
[02:18.180 --> 02:22.540]  Then Mike threw down some Lucinda Williams HC-FSE crystals.
[02:22.540 --> 02:25.340]  I dunked that into some Clementine turps.
[02:25.340 --> 02:26.340]  That was really nice.
[02:26.340 --> 02:27.620]  That was really nice.
[02:27.660 --> 02:32.060]  Then after the break, we smoked more of the Holy Grail Kush after Mike's little cigarette
[02:32.060 --> 02:33.060]  break.
[02:33.060 --> 02:35.740]  It was probably a good choice before we got into recording.
[02:35.740 --> 02:41.100]  We were, I don't know, there was a slowdown that needed to occur.
[02:41.100 --> 02:42.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42.100 --> 02:45.340]  We might've been too amped up after all that Clementine sativa type dabs.
[02:45.340 --> 02:46.340]  Yep.
[02:46.340 --> 02:47.820]  All that Clementine had me racing.
[02:47.820 --> 02:48.820]  Got me chilled out.
[02:48.820 --> 02:50.500]  Got me ready for a good podcast.
[02:50.500 --> 02:52.500]  Got me ready to go.
[02:52.500 --> 02:55.940]  Hey Mike, you ready to jump right into it?
[02:55.940 --> 02:56.940]  Let's do it.
[02:57.260 --> 03:01.060]  Let's go right starting with Oklahoma.
[03:01.060 --> 03:05.260]  So a couple of episodes ago, we talked about Oklahoma legalizing medical marijuana.
[03:05.260 --> 03:07.140]  Yes, we did.
[03:07.140 --> 03:08.860]  Shout out to all of our friends in Oklahoma.
[03:08.860 --> 03:11.700]  We got quite a few friends out there that listen to the podcast that support us.
[03:11.700 --> 03:12.700]  Big shout out.
[03:12.700 --> 03:13.700]  You know who you guys are.
[03:13.700 --> 03:15.220]  One of my friends sent us a message.
[03:15.220 --> 03:18.380]  He's like, hey dude, Oklahoma just legalized.
[03:18.380 --> 03:22.700]  And then as soon as they announced the rules, we realized that it totally sucks.
[03:22.700 --> 03:23.820]  So we did some investigating.
[03:23.820 --> 03:25.700]  I did some investigating.
[03:25.700 --> 03:28.180]  There's one thing I noticed.
[03:28.180 --> 03:31.140]  There is no list of qualifying conditions.
[03:31.140 --> 03:35.860]  It's just up to your doc to decide if you should get medical marijuana or not.
[03:35.860 --> 03:36.860]  As it was originally.
[03:36.860 --> 03:37.860]  Yeah.
[03:37.860 --> 03:42.300]  Oklahoma, you guys have some really interesting rules.
[03:42.300 --> 03:45.220]  The no list of requirements is just the one.
[03:45.220 --> 03:46.940]  What you've got a list of some others.
[03:46.940 --> 03:48.020]  You've got good notes on this.
[03:48.020 --> 03:50.620]  I just scanned a news article this morning.
[03:50.620 --> 03:54.960]  So they mentioned the first thing that I noticed was no list of qualifying conditions.
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.920]  So I guess we found a negative and a positive to that.
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.360]  The doc can assign your medical marijuana recommendation if you've got a hangnail and
[04:02.360 --> 04:04.880]  he thinks that your medical marijuana may help with that.
[04:04.880 --> 04:05.880]  So that's kind of cool.
[04:05.880 --> 04:08.920]  It does open it up.
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.800]  That's going to be up to the doc or the docs going to be liberal with that.
[04:12.800 --> 04:14.760]  Are they going to be kind of tight with that?
[04:14.760 --> 04:20.720]  I think it's, that's going to depend wildly on implementation and practice.
[04:20.920 --> 04:27.960]  I've just based in what other states have gone through, like I want to say it was Michigan
[04:27.960 --> 04:36.600]  that when the news got footage of 500 people in a hotel lobby, waiting in line to see the
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.200]  only two doctors in the state that were signing cards.
[04:40.200 --> 04:47.520]  The story was about how two doctors signed up 500 people in a weekend, not how only two
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.920]  doctors in the state are willing to do this.
[04:50.120 --> 04:56.040]  And so people have to jump, like the way the story was presented led to a backlash that
[04:56.040 --> 05:02.080]  completely imploded their system and they've had to restart like three times now.
[05:02.080 --> 05:09.040]  And with no patient list at this point in time, it's not going to be like California
[05:09.040 --> 05:13.320]  where there's people set up everywhere where you can walk in, get your card, walk across
[05:13.320 --> 05:16.120]  the street and shop medically.
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.640]  And that system has been in place for 20 years now.
[05:20.360 --> 05:25.480]  It's currently being rebuilt from the ground up under legalization, which apparently they
[05:25.480 --> 05:30.560]  weren't quite ready for, but California, you'll get there.
[05:30.560 --> 05:38.040]  But if the doctors like as a group start getting backlash because people are like certain members
[05:38.040 --> 05:43.000]  of their community are over prescribing for stuff that the rest of the community doesn't
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.680]  see as worthy, there might be some push and pull on different systems, different recommendations
[05:47.720 --> 05:51.400]  for different ailments.
[05:51.400 --> 05:56.720]  The way I was just thinking of it, though, is in Colorado, we've never been able to expand
[05:56.720 --> 05:58.920]  our list.
[05:58.920 --> 06:01.320]  There's a list of conditions.
[06:01.320 --> 06:04.640]  Several other conditions have been presented and pushed through the process.
[06:04.640 --> 06:09.520]  And at the last step, they get denied and they all get denied for the same reasons,
[06:09.520 --> 06:14.400]  because there's not a big FDA backed double blind study showing that cannabis is an effective
[06:14.400 --> 06:17.640]  treatment option for blank.
[06:17.640 --> 06:23.440]  There's a lot of anecdotal evidence, but until that last big study happens, fuck off.
[06:23.440 --> 06:25.880]  And now Oklahoma won't have to deal with that.
[06:25.880 --> 06:31.840]  If evidence starts to point to some treatment option that we're not currently utilizing
[06:31.840 --> 06:36.440]  cannabis for, they can just start recommending right off the bat for that.
[06:36.440 --> 06:39.720]  They don't have to tell that whole population, pretend you've got cancer.
[06:39.720 --> 06:40.720]  Right.
[06:40.720 --> 06:42.720]  Let us pretend you've got broken rule.
[06:42.720 --> 06:43.720]  Yeah.
[06:43.720 --> 06:44.720]  So we can get you in there.
[06:44.720 --> 06:45.720]  It'll take three years to do it.
[06:45.720 --> 06:46.720]  All right.
[06:46.800 --> 06:52.120]  So that's going to work to some folks advantage and it's up to the doc.
[06:52.120 --> 06:56.000]  Hopefully your doc is liberal and you're going to find good doctors there.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.080]  Trust me, that stuff happens.
[06:58.080 --> 07:03.520]  Another thing that popped out was they banned all smokable medical marijuana.
[07:03.520 --> 07:07.560]  So you can't smoke flowers.
[07:07.560 --> 07:10.600]  I don't like that because I feel...
[07:10.600 --> 07:13.000]  It's going to be a very odd rule.
[07:13.000 --> 07:14.000]  Yeah.
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  Yeah.
[07:15.280 --> 07:16.480]  I'm not the only place to do that.
[07:16.480 --> 07:19.880]  Florida is currently being sued and they're...
[07:19.880 --> 07:20.880]  If I...
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.440]  Sorry guys, it's been a crazy chunk of my life.
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.560]  Listeners of the show for a while know that my life's nuts right now, but I'm like 95%
[07:29.560 --> 07:37.680]  sure Florida patients just won the right to smoke their meds in court.
[07:37.680 --> 07:43.520]  That that provision of their law was struck down finally in court, but Oklahoma won't
[07:43.520 --> 07:45.960]  be the first to have that rule.
[07:45.960 --> 07:50.680]  And I think a lot of the rules we're about to cover from this point forward, if I remember
[07:50.680 --> 07:57.360]  right, the governor of Oklahoma was against the legalization initiative originally, which
[07:57.360 --> 08:03.480]  likely means they've been listening to a lot of the national anti-pop people.
[08:03.480 --> 08:08.640]  It's one of the things governors do if they've got a position on something from the onset,
[08:08.640 --> 08:13.840]  they look for other people arguing for their position and get the arguments from those
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.840]  people.
[08:14.840 --> 08:19.960]  And I think that's why we're seeing the list of rules we're seeing or that we're about
[08:19.960 --> 08:25.640]  to go over is because national anti-pop groups are trying a couple of different things to
[08:25.640 --> 08:28.320]  fuck over the industry.
[08:28.320 --> 08:32.280]  They've tried in a couple of states where legalizations already happened or medicals
[08:32.280 --> 08:35.880]  already happened and they haven't been successful.
[08:36.320 --> 08:40.360]  With Oklahoma, they're going to get some of them implemented from the get-go and we're
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.080]  going to see how it plays out.
[08:42.080 --> 08:43.080]  All right.
[08:43.080 --> 08:45.360]  They're supposed to have another meeting soon.
[08:45.360 --> 08:46.960]  There's a deadline set for this meeting.
[08:46.960 --> 08:50.640]  I know a lot of people in Oklahoma are really pissed over this is what I was reading.
[08:50.640 --> 08:53.600]  Yes, we've got friends that brought this to my attention, which is why we're talking about
[08:53.600 --> 08:54.600]  it.
[08:54.600 --> 08:55.600]  So shout out to our friends down there.
[08:55.600 --> 09:00.640]  So no smokable flowers, which I think that's weird because in my opinion, I'm not a doctor.
[09:00.640 --> 09:05.960]  In my opinion, smoking is the most immediate and effective relief.
[09:05.960 --> 09:10.360]  You can smoke and you feel it by the time you're exhaling, you feel it.
[09:10.360 --> 09:14.280]  If you're a flower smoker, by the time you blow out that flower, you feel it.
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.960]  If you're a dab smoker, by the time you blow out that dab, you feel it.
[09:16.960 --> 09:20.320]  If you can't consume flower, you're taking medicine away from people.
[09:20.320 --> 09:26.520]  Like the most effective, obvious, old school, traditional way of consuming, it is now removed.
[09:26.520 --> 09:28.440]  I think that's ridiculous.
[09:29.240 --> 09:30.760]  They do allow edibles.
[09:30.760 --> 09:35.240]  You can have edibles, which isn't that where we find all of our problems?
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.240]  Like 90% of our problems are with people fucking up with edibles.
[09:39.240 --> 09:48.560]  The, yeah, the, the path to edibles in 1998 was a lot safer than it is today.
[09:48.560 --> 09:50.400]  Like just being able to walk in and buy it.
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.720]  It's like teenagers with booze.
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.720]  It's just not something you should do without a guide, I think.
[09:57.720 --> 10:00.000]  Or at least like a pamphlet.
[10:00.000 --> 10:00.600]  Yeah.
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.440]  And a friend to sit there and be like, dude, you're just really big.
[10:05.440 --> 10:06.920]  Calm down.
[10:06.920 --> 10:09.240]  Don't call 911.
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.080]  Yeah, edibles have been where a lot of the stupid problems happen.
[10:15.080 --> 10:21.960]  Every place that legalizes, they get a big wave of poison center calls the next two years.
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.640]  And some of that's because people are stupid and irresponsible with edibles.
[10:26.640 --> 10:33.360]  But a lot of that's because these are exposures that were happening before and are now just
[10:33.360 --> 10:34.800]  being reported because of legalization.
[10:34.800 --> 10:41.280]  Like it's a good thing health wise, but it's a bad thing pro-legalization data wise.
[10:43.360 --> 10:46.640]  I think I just found it weird that they allow edibles.
[10:47.760 --> 10:48.800]  They're easier to hide.
[10:48.800 --> 10:50.720]  They're easier to have too much of.
[10:51.640 --> 10:53.480]  But you can't smoke a little bit of flour.
[10:53.480 --> 10:54.680]  I just didn't like that.
[10:54.680 --> 10:58.680]  People seem to think of them as safer than smoking.
[10:58.680 --> 11:01.560]  Like that's a main reason why that market's so popular.
[11:02.680 --> 11:03.560]  I get it.
[11:03.560 --> 11:04.600]  You're not smoking.
[11:04.600 --> 11:06.280]  You're not ruining your lungs.
[11:06.280 --> 11:08.040]  Which brings me to another part.
[11:08.040 --> 11:16.520]  They limited potency on flours to 20% and concentrates at 12% THC potency.
[11:17.400 --> 11:19.560]  12% on a concentrate.
[11:19.680 --> 11:25.120]  That's the way I read it in the press article.
[11:25.120 --> 11:26.480]  Didn't make a lot of sense.
[11:27.040 --> 11:29.200]  How do you have a concentrate with 12% THC?
[11:29.200 --> 11:34.880]  And this was what I mentioned just a minute ago that I think the governor of Oklahoma
[11:34.880 --> 11:37.840]  may have been listening to some of the national anti-pot folks.
[11:37.840 --> 11:42.400]  Limiting THC potency is a big thing Project Sam's been pushing.
[11:43.920 --> 11:45.760]  They tried it in Colorado and failed.
[11:46.480 --> 11:48.400]  They tried it in Canada and failed.
[11:48.440 --> 11:50.840]  They've tried it in a couple of other states and failed.
[11:52.200 --> 11:55.560]  And it looks like they might have succeeded somewhat in Oklahoma and Colorado.
[11:55.560 --> 11:56.920]  They were going for 12 or 16%.
[11:57.560 --> 11:58.060]  Oh no.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.040]  Cap for flour.
[12:00.840 --> 12:02.440]  It would have reset the whole industry.
[12:04.600 --> 12:05.320]  This is going to...
[12:06.680 --> 12:14.840]  The way I read it had the plant potency and it specified it as like your plant potency can be 20.
[12:15.840 --> 12:22.400]  It didn't specify flour but it made it seem like flour was included in the 12% limit.
[12:22.400 --> 12:22.900]  Okay.
[12:22.900 --> 12:29.920]  So when I've got a plant at the end it can be or that plant can test at 20% but my final product
[12:29.920 --> 12:32.720]  says they're not going to release flour because flours are illegal, right?
[12:34.320 --> 12:34.960]  Or can you...
[12:36.160 --> 12:40.560]  I honestly don't know the rules in Oklahoma or the proposed rules in Oklahoma well enough
[12:41.400 --> 12:47.880]  to know if they allow flours to be sold for like with a sticker on it that says to be vaped only.
[12:47.880 --> 12:48.380]  Okay.
[12:48.920 --> 12:52.440]  Because like tabletop vapes and flour vapes have been a thing for a decade or more.
[12:52.440 --> 12:52.940]  Right.
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.000]  Well it sounds like your flours can only test at 20% and then you've got to turn them into
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.880]  a concentrate that only tests at 12% THC is what it kind of sounds like.
[13:01.880 --> 13:09.400]  They allow home grows and so like there's going to be plenty of flour out and it's not like there's
[13:09.440 --> 13:12.480]  going to be a possible system for testing flour from home grows.
[13:12.480 --> 13:14.080]  That's going to take a long time.
[13:14.080 --> 13:15.840]  Yeah that's a 20-year project folks.
[13:17.280 --> 13:19.520]  So why do you want to limit the amount of potency?
[13:19.520 --> 13:22.960]  I know because they don't want people getting too high.
[13:22.960 --> 13:30.480]  It's the drum beat that the anti-pot one of the notes that they found that resonate with people is
[13:31.400 --> 13:34.840]  the weed of the 60s was 1% THC.
[13:35.560 --> 13:40.040]  The weed of today is 30 and the concentrates go to 90 plus.
[13:40.040 --> 13:40.540]  Yep.
[13:40.920 --> 13:46.280]  I mean it's a bullshit argument because the weed of the fucking 60s was not 1%.
[13:48.680 --> 13:54.840]  If you're curious that number is comes from including all DEA seizures which include feral
[13:54.880 --> 14:01.280]  hemp and so like in 1964 they rounded up a lot more feral hemp and they rounded up
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.400]  pounds of Colombian herb being shipped in and sold freely across the country.
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.880]  And that number got reported down the chain to us today and so now anti-pot people like it was 1%
[14:14.880 --> 14:17.200]  and 69 right here it says so in the book.
[14:19.120 --> 14:21.600]  And I bet their testing labs back then were phenomenal.
[14:21.640 --> 14:23.560]  Well yeah and what gets tested?
[14:24.920 --> 14:27.000]  The stick the stand they just put the whole thing in there.
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.360]  I have no idea do they test it like they weigh it and they're like we found this pound of weed
[14:32.360 --> 14:36.840]  the Ford F-150 this fucking 3,500 pounds of marijuana.
[14:36.840 --> 14:39.160]  They tested it with the F-150 attached to it.
[14:39.160 --> 14:45.000]  We ground up the F-150 and it came out to 0.01% THC but it's THC.
[14:45.000 --> 14:45.800]  That's how they do it.
[14:47.480 --> 14:50.040]  But the fuck was I even talking about?
[14:50.080 --> 14:50.640]  I don't even know.
[14:50.640 --> 14:53.200]  Got me railed about fucking cops stupid weighing the weed.
[14:53.200 --> 14:53.400]  I don't even know anymore.
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.880]  Yeah but concentrates so much percentages.
[14:56.880 --> 14:58.240]  The THC potency.
[14:58.240 --> 15:00.800]  We're getting way higher now it's not our mom's weed anymore.
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.000]  Yeah the it's just a bullshit argument that they've made that resonates with people and.
[15:07.440 --> 15:13.360]  My argument against that is if I'm trying to medicate and I'm just going to make up numbers
[15:13.360 --> 15:16.960]  here I don't I don't know the numbers to my medication you know what I mean this is just
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.400]  hypothetically if I'm going to medicate and I need to get to let's say a thousand right would
[15:22.400 --> 15:27.760]  you rather me take 10 inhalations of something that's at a hundred or would you rather me take
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.760]  two inhalations of 500 as a medical marijuana patient do you want me to inhale and exhale
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.480]  smoke or vapor 10 times or two times which is healthier for my lungs and body.
[15:39.760 --> 15:46.560]  That's literally like 50% of the reason concentrates exist is the community wanted
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.240]  a way to get rid of the actual combustion the unhealthy part of the smoking.
[15:52.240 --> 15:52.480]  Yeah.
[15:53.520 --> 16:00.880]  And we found a way to do that and keep the immediate kick of inhalation we get that that
[16:00.880 --> 16:08.720]  immediate immediate and you can titrate it perfectly you take a puff you give it 30 seconds
[16:08.720 --> 16:14.400]  at most and nope I would like another hit when the joint comes around I'm going to hit it again
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.800]  by the time the joint comes around again you know nope I'm where I want to be nope I want a
[16:18.800 --> 16:20.960]  little more nope that was a little too much. Yep.
[16:21.520 --> 16:28.000]  It's it's a beautiful system and we kept it with vaping and we've it's just gotten cleaner and
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.080]  cleaner and cleaner and cleaner and healthier and healthier and healthier and it's also gotten
[16:32.080 --> 16:39.520]  a lot scarier and so the anti-pop people are able to get footage of somebody doing a dab and
[16:40.240 --> 16:45.600]  they go on the news and they're like they're smoking 99% pure THC crystals that they have
[16:45.600 --> 16:52.800]  to smoke with a blowtorch and then they show that b-roll and it scares the fuck out of church folk
[16:53.520 --> 16:58.400]  and then you get 12% THC limits because I'm wondering how the fuck they even do that
[16:59.200 --> 17:06.240]  like if the flowers allowed at 20 like the plants allowed at 20 what do they do with that 20%
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.880]  product they've got to cut it right yeah yeah just like keep pouring propylene glycol on it
[17:12.880 --> 17:18.400]  until it's at 12 or what something like that yeah I don't I really don't know how you reduce your
[17:18.400 --> 17:28.640]  THC. Oklahomans like I don't even know um time for like if this is gonna be real I know this is all
[17:28.640 --> 17:35.040]  still in the process but uh if they're trying to to really go with some of these rules y'all might
[17:35.040 --> 17:41.040]  want to just pick a day that's not 420 or 710 and get together at the capitol and just like don't
[17:41.040 --> 17:47.600]  smoke don't fucking wave pot leaf flags just show up let them know why you're there and just fucking
[17:47.600 --> 17:54.320]  sit in the fucking way for like three days but they need somebody it takes a lot to get these
[17:54.320 --> 18:00.240]  people to notice and if they some of these rules are as far along as I think they are like the day
[18:00.320 --> 18:07.040]  for writing op-eds isn't passed but like they have another meeting planned but not scheduled at the
[18:07.040 --> 18:11.760]  time that I wrote this they had the meeting planned but not scheduled to talk with the committee that's
[18:11.760 --> 18:18.160]  working on this yep the article I read said I want to say it was like the Oklahoma department
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.320]  of health and human services or some such department Oklahoma state department of health
[18:22.320 --> 18:28.400]  yes that one um when they released these rules they kind of admitted that they're not sure that
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.440]  they have the authority to make a couple of these rules like they might be totally out of the scope
[18:33.440 --> 18:38.160]  of their purview but okay so if you guys this applies for everywhere that is working on
[18:38.160 --> 18:42.160]  legalization and we're running out of states that are working on it we're getting it's a good thing
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.640]  we're getting to more states that are have got some sort of legalization but if you're working on
[18:46.640 --> 18:53.680]  getting cannabis legalized wherever you are get somebody like Mike or myself involved like
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.240]  convince one of us that Mike's easy to get to a city council meeting to help you write rules
[18:58.240 --> 19:03.360]  you need somebody that is actually a consumer that's actually doing this you wouldn't you
[19:03.360 --> 19:07.520]  wouldn't call I'm trying to think of weird weird fucking analogies you wouldn't call your math
[19:07.520 --> 19:11.280]  teacher to teach you how to work the buzzsaw and you wouldn't call your shop teacher to teach you
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.320]  how to do math get the get some people that are in the industry up here talking about cannabis with
[19:16.320 --> 19:19.920]  these people that are making the rules so when they say so we're going to do plants at 20 percent
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.600]  and concentrates at 12 I can laugh and shake my head and go wait you guys have no idea what the
[19:23.600 --> 19:28.080]  fuck you're talking about we can straighten them out before it gets this far so we gotta get we
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.760]  gotta get somebody on our team in these meetings everywhere when we did the the Oklahoma and Canada
[19:33.760 --> 19:42.080]  episode I stressed like the time to get involved is is now in in Oklahoma the time to get involved
[19:42.720 --> 19:49.280]  like now is now past tense yeah it's that was like a month ago you might have to deal with
[19:50.000 --> 20:00.720]  right now you're late but continuing to not act is still a bad choice start writing op-eds to
[20:00.720 --> 20:07.360]  any local paper any state paper you can contact the governor you can contact the state to port of
[20:07.360 --> 20:14.000]  health board of health or whatever that committee is you can email all these people directly and
[20:14.000 --> 20:20.480]  let them know hey I voted for this these are the reasons why these are why explicitly these
[20:20.480 --> 20:26.560]  specific rules are bad here's what I would like to see instead you can do it like three or four
[20:26.560 --> 20:32.640]  paragraphs you don't have to do the hi my name is here's why I give a fuck you can just get right to
[20:32.640 --> 20:39.760]  the meat of your issue hi governor so and so I'm writing to you about blank law I don't like blank
[20:39.840 --> 20:45.920]  rule I think it should be this instead so I don't like the THC caps I think there should be no limit
[20:45.920 --> 20:53.760]  like it is in most of the other functioning medical marijuana states if you want help wording that feel
[20:53.760 --> 20:59.280]  free to contact me on trouble for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook there you go follow
[20:59.280 --> 21:02.960]  them on Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook support that you can get updates from
[21:02.960 --> 21:06.960]  Mike speaking of updates I've got another message from our friend in Oklahoma that's telling me
[21:06.960 --> 21:11.200]  what's going on he says there's another meeting in August the health department will meet and get
[21:11.200 --> 21:17.280]  meet again and then they will have elections coming up in November so I'm betting before that
[21:17.280 --> 21:24.400]  meeting there will be a period for open comment and then at that meeting there'll be a portion
[21:24.400 --> 21:29.200]  for public comment it will be one of those fun public meetings that goes for like 12 and a half
[21:29.200 --> 21:37.840]  hours but during the portion for open public comment you just email them and then your email
[21:37.840 --> 21:41.520]  gets distributed to the whole committee and everybody's supposed to read them and
[21:42.560 --> 21:49.360]  getting messages across that way if you get a group of people to do it and most of them are
[21:50.720 --> 21:55.600]  functional communicators you can get a lot of good change made that way
[21:56.240 --> 22:01.040]  folks in Oklahoma now's the time to start emailing those folks find who you need to email in your
[22:01.040 --> 22:05.680]  locality in your state find who you need to email in the state your state rep and let them know that
[22:05.680 --> 22:09.760]  how you want these medical marijuana laws adjusted now's the time to start doing that so start
[22:09.760 --> 22:14.160]  sending out the email start going to the meetings if you hear anything about a meeting about medical
[22:14.160 --> 22:20.640]  marijuana go attend it be a part of it rally the troops just go and listen like that's all you have
[22:21.600 --> 22:29.040]  to do to start is just go and listen and start writing emails please he also says
[22:29.040 --> 22:37.760]  no grows or dispensaries until August which means most of the zoning rules and all of that
[22:37.760 --> 22:44.640]  haven't been finalized yet either which means people need to start watching for those briefs
[22:44.640 --> 22:54.480]  in the local paper if you're in Oklahoma right now you should be able to like look up your city
[22:54.480 --> 23:02.800]  your town or county or whatever they call it there and find your government's web page and say you
[23:02.800 --> 23:09.280]  live in Tulsa you should be able to look up the Tulsa city government's web page and on there
[23:09.840 --> 23:16.080]  they'll have their agenda listed for every week and scanning through those agendas is where I
[23:16.080 --> 23:25.280]  found the meat of all of the zoning rule making hearings here in Pueblo that stuff didn't make
[23:25.280 --> 23:31.520]  the paper until the day of usually or if it made the paper at all it would be in a past tense like
[23:31.520 --> 23:36.560]  by the way on Monday you missed right this happened at this meeting you didn't get to
[23:36.560 --> 23:42.240]  but after two or three weeks of just checking back with the Pueblo city the city of Pueblo
[23:42.240 --> 23:47.760]  web page I figured out that when they uploaded their new thing every week and then I just checked
[23:47.760 --> 23:54.480]  back I can't I think it was Mondays check back Monday at like noon and scan through it real
[23:54.480 --> 23:58.560]  quick to see if they had anything that pertained to us and when they did I'd made sure I was there
[23:59.760 --> 24:05.360]  to the point where I haven't been in a while and city council members that have been there for a
[24:05.360 --> 24:10.800]  while have been asking about me like where's Mike yep is he okay he just disappeared Mike's got a
[24:10.800 --> 24:16.480]  kid and a brand new kid so Mike's a little bit distracted folks that's where he is yeah two kids
[24:16.480 --> 24:20.080]  it's a lot it is a lot to keep you moving we'll do thanks for coming and doing a podcast with us
[24:20.080 --> 24:24.320]  it's good to have you here every so often the folks do like your presence on the show they
[24:24.320 --> 24:30.960]  like it when we ramble so uh potency what what the hell with the potency yeah that's a fucked up rule
[24:30.960 --> 24:36.320]  y'all yeah and that's it just doesn't it doesn't just suck for customers the reason the anti-pop
[24:36.320 --> 24:42.960]  people are pushing that is because it cripples businesses when you grow a strand of cannabis
[24:42.960 --> 24:50.720]  the potency can vary wildly based on a dozen different factors um you're 30 killer arise like
[24:51.360 --> 25:00.160]  if I grow it um uh it just there's so many things that go into it when uh when a crop harvests you
[25:00.160 --> 25:07.920]  have no idea if you've got a 16 or if you've got a 30 and if you send half of your crop off to or
[25:07.920 --> 25:12.480]  send off all your testing samples and half of them come back over 20 if you've got to destroy all
[25:12.480 --> 25:18.480]  that product yeah like business can't operate like that especially not with the federal tax
[25:18.480 --> 25:23.280]  laws on top of our throats and that's part of what sets business apart here in Colorado
[25:23.280 --> 25:26.720]  it's I'm not like this because it's not how I shop but when you walk into a dispensary
[25:26.720 --> 25:32.240]  you hear half the people say what's your highest testing product what's got the most THCA that's
[25:32.240 --> 25:35.520]  what I want to buy right now give me that I don't care what it looks like I don't care what it smells
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.800]  like I want the most THCA then I'm leaving so that's kind of a selling point you want those
[25:40.800 --> 25:46.640]  30s those 32s those 33s and 34s it's just hard to find but when you find them that that's what
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.360]  the people want to buy so that's like kind of a you're taking a strategy away from the market
[25:51.360 --> 25:56.880]  right there yep it uh it's not just a strategy away from the market it's just
[25:58.560 --> 26:05.600]  because then the sales pitches we've got $19.99 like come get your $19.99 with us come share $11.99
[26:05.600 --> 26:12.320]  with us I would have to make mistakes to grow 20 THCA flowers right I'd have to just not feed it
[26:12.320 --> 26:18.640]  any nutrient we'd have to cut it down weeks early yeah early cut it down a week seven but uh
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.280]  so none of the genetics I grow would be able to work there it's a rule they're pimping by design
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.320]  like it's this is a thought-out strategy it's not something they've stumbled upon because they're
[26:28.320 --> 26:34.800]  scared um they're able to sell it because it scares people that won't look into it very deeply
[26:35.440 --> 26:41.920]  but that's I mean it's just one of the the rules that they're pushing right now they they they also
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.560]  want it like the skull and the crossbones and the three pages of warnings to come right product yeah
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.520]  yeah well I hope they get it figured out down there let's move on to the uh so shout out to
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.440]  you guys for getting it figured out I hope you guys keep going to meetings and uh get it dialed
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.440]  in because what you got right now is going to be a challenge yep let's move forward I've got
[26:59.440 --> 27:05.120]  another subject here um a while back there was whoa I just let's make sure we didn't just kill
[27:05.120 --> 27:10.160]  that recording all right we're still going sorry uh a while back there was a chain of dispensaries
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.200]  that got in trouble for doing a thing that was called looping what looping is is a chain of
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.680]  dispensaries that got in trouble for doing a thing that was called looping what looping is
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.480]  is uh basically in the state of Colorado a recreational cannabis purchaser is allowed
[27:24.480 --> 27:31.440]  to buy one ounce of recreational cannabis per day per person one uno eints uh one ounce you get one
[27:31.440 --> 27:37.760]  um and if uh so what was happening these guys were buying their one ounce they were going out to the
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.400]  car I don't know what was really happening but then they were coming back within the same business
[27:42.400 --> 27:49.360]  for a long time in Colorado the law specifically says I can sell you one ounce of marijuana per
[27:49.360 --> 27:58.480]  transaction the law says transaction that's the word in the law and so for years in Colorado
[27:59.120 --> 28:06.640]  transaction was the practice too most stores didn't care if you came in bought your limit
[28:06.640 --> 28:11.280]  came back in five or ten or thirty minutes bought your limit again and left they just
[28:11.280 --> 28:19.120]  enjoyed the extra sale that's that's what looping is that's where this stemmed from eventually the
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.000]  marijuana enforcement division and the Colorado Department of Revenue realized that this was kind
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.400]  of a loophole so they sent out a memo saying you cannot do this anymore at that point most
[28:30.400 --> 28:39.040]  dispensaries stopped they formed uh they formed a group to change the law um and make uh the one
[28:39.040 --> 28:46.800]  ounce per day official law um and then they sent out a memo saying the law that we're gonna pass
[28:46.800 --> 28:55.280]  in January goes into effect in August um and the marijuana industry operating under the rules that
[28:55.280 --> 29:02.960]  they do most of the industry complied because when we get a memo from the MED we just say sir
[29:02.960 --> 29:08.640]  yes sir how many would you like sir yep like we don't ask questions we don't ask for clarification
[29:08.640 --> 29:13.760]  we just try really hard to do whatever they say that's a great segue into the article that I'm
[29:13.760 --> 29:20.000]  about to read this is why this is why the industry kisses the MED's ass a little bit this article
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.120]  comes from a website called maryjane.com it's m-e-r-r-y jane.com mary jane excuse me for the
[29:27.120 --> 29:30.160]  throat clearing in this episode we talked about all the dabs earlier this article is written by a
[29:30.160 --> 29:35.600]  person who was named chris moore and it goes like this sweet leaf lost all of its denver-based
[29:35.600 --> 29:42.640]  cannabis licenses for looping or selling more than 26 one ounce of weed per customer yeah 26 licenses
[29:42.640 --> 29:46.960]  i'll read the article one of the one of colorado's largest cannabis enterprises just lost their right
[29:46.960 --> 29:50.880]  to do business in denver after getting busted for selling unlawful amounts of weed to their
[29:50.880 --> 29:55.840]  customers sweet leaf is a successful canna company operating a number of legally licensed
[29:55.840 --> 30:00.720]  cultivation and processing facilities as well as dispensaries all across the state was the subject
[30:00.720 --> 30:05.840]  of a year-long investigation by local authorities working to track down on loop to crack down on
[30:05.840 --> 30:10.240]  looping the practice of selling customers more marijuana than state law allows i'm going to kind
[30:10.240 --> 30:14.480]  of skim over this because it's longer than i wanted to go but i've got to get you all the
[30:14.640 --> 30:20.160]  points uh we talked about colorado customers can only buy one ounce per day sweet leaf argued
[30:21.360 --> 30:27.040]  they reportedly use justification to let customers purchase more than legally allowed police raided
[30:27.040 --> 30:33.760]  eight stores in denver in march and in april denver officials held hearings on disciplinary actions
[30:33.760 --> 30:37.920]  against stores accused of looping city city attorney showed up with reams of evidence against
[30:37.920 --> 30:43.360]  sweet leaf including video of undercover cops purchasing prohibited amounts of weed from their
[30:43.360 --> 30:49.760]  stores as well as interviews with the company's employees he estimated the attorneys estimated
[30:49.760 --> 30:55.040]  that one single sweet leaf dispensary made over 1 000 looping transactions netting the company an
[30:55.040 --> 31:02.320]  additional four million dollars there's a reason companies were willing to do this yeah four
[31:02.320 --> 31:07.680]  million dollars sounds like a decent reason but look at bit him in the ass uh then it says this
[31:07.680 --> 31:13.920]  week uh the denver department of excise and licenses revoked all 26 of sweet leaf's medical
[31:13.920 --> 31:18.400]  marijuana and recreational marijuana licenses effectively preventing the company from
[31:18.400 --> 31:23.520]  continuing to do business in the city of denver so that's what happens you guys we're not fucking
[31:23.520 --> 31:26.880]  around everyone thinks we're just hanging out getting high uh that you can come in and buy a
[31:26.880 --> 31:30.400]  bunch of weed and then just hang out and take a couple dabs in the back with the people that work
[31:30.400 --> 31:37.280]  there nah bro if you fuck up they'll come in and take all of your licensing is in denver is 5 000
[31:37.440 --> 31:44.240]  license so they were paying 130 000 a year to the city and 130 000 a year to the state for those
[31:44.240 --> 31:51.760]  licenses they lost just to have the licenses just to have yeah they were making an additional four
[31:51.760 --> 31:57.360]  million through looping what were they making through those 26 facilities without looping they
[31:57.360 --> 32:02.080]  were one of the largest outfits in colorado yeah they were huge everybody knew who sweet leaf was
[32:02.880 --> 32:10.640]  uh let's have their own edible line several grows several stores the company does have the right to
[32:10.640 --> 32:15.680]  appeal the decision but they also still have licenses not in denver yes that is accurate
[32:15.680 --> 32:20.800]  they have a location in oregon somewhere they've got one in aurora i think they've got one in thorton
[32:22.240 --> 32:25.840]  there might be one in colorado springs anyway i'm gonna keep reading the article there's like
[32:25.840 --> 32:31.040]  two short paragraphs left it says enforcing rules when violations occur occur is an essential part
[32:31.040 --> 32:36.560]  of denver's successful regulation of one of the largest legalized marijuana markets in the world
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.960]  kilroy said in a statement reported by the westward sweet leaf's illegal actions undermine
[32:40.960 --> 32:46.080]  the entire regulatory framework created by amendment 64 the journal assembly and the denver
[32:46.080 --> 32:51.680]  city council the decision supports the will of the voters for a regulated legal marijuana market
[32:51.680 --> 32:56.960]  safeguards the legal marijuana industry and protects the safety and welfare of the public
[32:56.960 --> 33:01.040]  like mike said sweet leaf still runs three other dispensaries in the state which are not affected
[33:01.040 --> 33:06.640]  by this ruling and will remain open many of the company's bud tenders have been arrested in
[33:06.640 --> 33:12.000]  connection with the investigation but the majority of them have now been released without criminal
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.520]  charges so you guys if you mess around with the med they will come raid your stores they will take
[33:17.520 --> 33:21.280]  the bud tenders to jail a lot of people were taken straight to jail a lot of them were released some
[33:21.280 --> 33:27.120]  of them did face charges then they will shut down your business well there's a lot of talk that this
[33:27.120 --> 33:37.040]  story isn't over yet this was sort of the death blow to the company but they still have several
[33:37.040 --> 33:43.120]  locations they i'm i'm guessing they've still got at least one or two grows going um they're
[33:43.120 --> 33:52.000]  certainly not completely dead right uh and with that many bud tenders arrested that many bud tenders
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.920]  set free with no charges and currently no management or ownership has been charged with a
[33:57.920 --> 34:04.000]  single thing like this story definitely has the potential to go on for longer i think that they're
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.560]  just uh compiling and thinking still giving it a minute and uh letting the rope sit there and
[34:10.560 --> 34:15.440]  waiting to see what kind of knot you tie at the end of it all right well if anybody uh sticks their
[34:15.440 --> 34:23.360]  head through the end of that knot we will definitely let you guys know sweet leaf no more in denver nope
[34:25.360 --> 34:32.480]  did uh did you see the story this week uh you saw that the public consumption buses got
[34:32.480 --> 34:40.240]  fucked with in denver right yes there was one day where denver um somebody i think it was a multi-agency
[34:40.240 --> 34:46.000]  so dpd and the med and a couple of other groups got together and they raided two of the buses
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.640]  and they gave everybody public consumption tickets and fucking cited the driver and uh
[34:53.200 --> 35:00.480]  cited the company um for basically hosting an unlicensed consumption event and then left like
[35:00.480 --> 35:04.880]  there weren't like mass arrests they're like the company didn't have to bail 40 tourists out of
[35:05.120 --> 35:12.320]  county or anything um but uh it was announced this week that that was because of the cnn footage from
[35:12.320 --> 35:18.880]  new year's eve oh that makes sense where uh cnn reporter was flashing the fucking gas mask bong
[35:18.880 --> 35:24.960]  and shit on cnn's new year's eve coverage so uh mike said consumption bus some folks may not
[35:24.960 --> 35:31.760]  know what those words mean in a row together like that consumption bus what uh so a while
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.280]  back colorado decided that it was illegal to consume any cannabis products zoinks yeah but
[35:37.280 --> 35:42.160]  the fucking drivers blocked off like they're in their own airtight chamber away from the rest of
[35:42.160 --> 35:47.680]  the fun bus so colorado outlawed smoking in a public place you can't we can't smoke at gatherings
[35:47.680 --> 35:54.080]  anymore that are indoors that's not allowed but you can rent a private bus and pull it up right
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.720]  outside of the club and let people that are 21 and over onto that bus and then they can bring
[35:58.720 --> 36:03.440]  their own concentrates and they can smoke out in the bus or at least that's been happening
[36:03.440 --> 36:09.120]  on the regular for five years now yeah we thought that that was cool but on new year's a reporter
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.760]  came and did a little article and featured one of the buses and was like hey look we're doing this
[36:13.760 --> 36:19.040]  and so that triggered the marijuana enforcement division the denver department of the denver
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.080]  police department and whoever else decided to jump in that day they decided one night to go
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.680]  and take down a couple of the private party consumption buses so well they were they were
[36:29.680 --> 36:36.480]  working on this big case for like six fucking months dude took him six months to go hit the
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.480]  consumption bus yeah they uh they take their time when they're busting stoners
[36:42.400 --> 36:47.840]  they knew they weren't going anywhere they were on the bus they knew where to find them um and it's
[36:47.840 --> 36:55.280]  it's one of those things where it was so poorly done on law enforcement's part like the companies
[36:55.280 --> 37:01.680]  are fucking suing the city and out or at least threatening to um they're not at all amused their
[37:01.680 --> 37:06.480]  lawyers are pissed right this has been going on for years now if somebody had a problem with it
[37:06.480 --> 37:11.680]  a letter in the first six months of operation would have taken care of it it has lessened the
[37:12.480 --> 37:19.040]  need or desire for me to illegally consume cannabis inside of a venue if i'm seeing a reggae
[37:19.040 --> 37:25.120]  band and i know that the dab bus is right outside and i'll just go out there and take a dab you know
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.200]  there's no need to smoke a joint illegally in the reggae show i just go out there and take a quick
[37:29.200 --> 37:35.920]  dab between bands and come right back in and see the concert and part of me is still just kind of
[37:35.920 --> 37:43.280]  pissed that we have to have this fight still yeah right like we've we legalized marijuana
[37:44.080 --> 37:49.040]  it's been common practice to consume marijuana in big public gatherings for
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.000]  i can't even tell you how long literally every fucking concert i've ever been to since the time
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.600]  i was five um there ought to be a place at every concert venue where it's like oh you want to smoke
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.280]  a joint can you please just go over to section k right like yep it's it shouldn't be that hard
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.680]  like oh reggae band playing at the bar tonight fucking if you want to smoke just run up to the
[38:09.680 --> 38:15.120]  roof yeah like it's we don't need fucking special buses but apparently we needed special buses and
[38:15.120 --> 38:22.640]  now they're not even sure if we can have the buses like it's just such a headache yep so again guys i
[38:22.640 --> 38:26.720]  know i always talk about writing rules and being involved in legislation there's consumption rules
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.960]  make sure there's somewhere that you can consume when you write your new rules bring that up
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.040]  get that on the books all right i want to give a couple shout outs big shout out to my friend
[38:35.040 --> 38:40.800]  maddie a special shout out to sam and a big fat shout out to justin aldridge thanks for all the
