[00:00.000 --> 00:02.940]  Yo what's up podcast world it's Rasta Jeff.
[00:02.940 --> 00:06.880]  Before we get the show started let me make a quick disclaimer and sort of an apology.
[00:06.880 --> 00:10.920]  I feel like I recorded a solid podcast episode, I put my heart and soul into this.
[00:10.920 --> 00:11.920]  I wrote a lot of notes.
[00:11.920 --> 00:14.480]  I spent a lot of time recording this show.
[00:14.480 --> 00:18.280]  As I was listening back to edit, parts of the audio files started disappearing.
[00:18.280 --> 00:22.400]  I don't know what was happening to my computer or my software, but the words I was saying
[00:22.400 --> 00:25.640]  were disappearing from the fucking screen as time went on.
[00:25.640 --> 00:28.920]  The more I tried to play with the computer and edit and figure out what happened, the
[00:28.920 --> 00:34.320]  more shit was disappearing so it was making my podcast vanish one paragraph at a time.
[00:34.320 --> 00:38.400]  You guys, the podcast you're gonna get has some missing chunks and I don't know what
[00:38.400 --> 00:39.400]  went wrong.
[00:39.400 --> 00:40.400]  I apologize.
[00:40.400 --> 00:41.400]  I'm embarrassed.
[00:41.400 --> 00:42.400]  I'm frustrated.
[00:42.400 --> 00:45.160]  It's nearly 1.30 and I owe you a Thursday episode.
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.560]  I want to put this out so that you know I at least tried and I didn't let you down.
[00:49.560 --> 00:52.480]  If you really want to know what I said and those parts that are missing, I'll do my
[00:52.480 --> 00:55.740]  best to go back and kind of piece it together.
[00:55.740 --> 01:00.420]  But honestly, it's driving me nuts so this is what I've got to offer you and I apologize
[01:00.420 --> 01:02.580]  for the half-assed podcast.
[01:02.580 --> 01:04.700]  There will be times when the audio drops out.
[01:04.700 --> 01:05.700]  Just be patient.
[01:05.700 --> 01:06.700]  Keep listening.
[01:06.700 --> 01:07.700]  It'll come back.
[01:07.700 --> 01:09.920]  Hopefully, you don't miss too much.
[01:09.920 --> 01:15.660]  This episode is all about building a drip system or an automated water system.
[01:15.660 --> 01:17.140]  Excuse me for that also.
[01:17.140 --> 01:18.300]  It's getting late.
[01:18.300 --> 01:20.740]  So if you're not into that, you're not gonna miss a lot.
[01:20.740 --> 01:24.180]  If you're really into building an auto water system and you miss stuff in here, let me
[01:24.180 --> 01:26.540]  know and we'll try to get it together for you.
[01:26.540 --> 01:28.020]  You guys, my throat's burned out.
[01:28.020 --> 01:29.020]  It's late.
[01:29.020 --> 01:30.580]  I'm gonna take some dabs and get some sleep.
[01:30.580 --> 01:31.580]  I love you.
[01:31.580 --> 01:32.580]  Here's my podcast.
[01:32.580 --> 01:35.780]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:35.780 --> 01:39.660]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:39.660 --> 01:41.180]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:41.180 --> 01:42.180]  That's right.
[01:42.180 --> 01:46.580]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[01:46.580 --> 01:50.620]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current
[01:50.620 --> 01:54.620]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:54.620 --> 01:55.620]  I'm your host.
[01:55.620 --> 01:56.620]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:56.620 --> 01:59.620]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:59.620 --> 02:03.580]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:03.580 --> 02:07.960]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:07.960 --> 02:11.300]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:11.300 --> 02:15.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong or start heating up that
[02:15.580 --> 02:19.460]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:20.620 --> 02:26.700]  Yo, what's up weed world?
[02:26.700 --> 02:29.820]  It's time for episode 335 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:29.820 --> 02:30.820]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:30.820 --> 02:35.180]  I've got a lot to talk about in this episode, so I'm going to try and make this intro quick.
[02:35.180 --> 02:38.420]  I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[02:38.420 --> 02:42.820]  Today, I've been taking dabs of the Chem Brûlé full spectrum extract from our friends at
[02:42.820 --> 02:44.320]  Green Dot Labs.
[02:44.320 --> 02:47.740]  This is the Copper Chem X2 Lemon Brûlé.
[02:47.740 --> 02:52.580]  It is described as rotten lemon rind and sour fuel, and I think that is a perfect description.
[02:52.580 --> 02:54.020]  It tastes delicious.
[02:54.020 --> 02:55.780]  The dabs are nice and smooth.
[02:55.780 --> 02:57.160]  The high goes straight to the eyes.
[02:57.160 --> 02:58.160]  It's a straight head high.
[02:58.160 --> 02:59.960]  I love what it did to my head.
[02:59.960 --> 03:02.100]  The dab was super smooth.
[03:02.100 --> 03:06.300]  It tastes really good, and the consistency, the appearance, and the texture are perfect.
[03:06.300 --> 03:11.660]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the Chem Brûlé full spectrum extract.
[03:11.660 --> 03:12.660]  It is Rasta Jeff approved.
[03:12.660 --> 03:15.340]  All right, you guys, we've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[03:15.340 --> 03:20.700]  I am going to run you guys through building a drip system or an automated or assisted
[03:20.700 --> 03:23.100]  watering system for your grow.
[03:23.100 --> 03:25.100]  I'm going to do two different versions.
[03:25.100 --> 03:30.420]  I'm going to do a setup using kind of like a water wand setup to where you have a wand
[03:30.420 --> 03:34.280]  and you water each plant with this wand, but it will be set up to a reservoir so you're
[03:34.280 --> 03:35.280]  being fed.
[03:35.280 --> 03:42.380]  Then we're also going to run through a setup using emitters or sprinklers in each plant.
[03:42.380 --> 03:44.020]  Both of these setups could be useful to you.
[03:44.020 --> 03:46.500]  It's up to you to decide which setup you like.
[03:46.500 --> 03:49.260]  In veg, I usually use the water wand.
[03:49.260 --> 03:53.900]  In flower, that's when I switch to the auto or assisted watering system.
[03:53.900 --> 03:56.980]  A lot of what I'm saying will need to be customized for your grow.
[03:56.980 --> 03:59.180]  This will need to be custom tailored for your setup.
[03:59.180 --> 04:01.860]  Everything will need to be custom measured for your grow.
[04:01.860 --> 04:05.760]  This is going to be a very good guideline on how to get you started building a drip
[04:05.760 --> 04:06.760]  system.
[04:06.760 --> 04:07.760]  All right?
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.420]  This will be useful for any size grow, anywhere from one light to 500 lights.
[04:12.420 --> 04:13.900]  These ideas will work for you.
[04:13.940 --> 04:15.580]  They just may need to be modified.
[04:15.580 --> 04:17.540]  Again, I'm going to talk about two different setups.
[04:17.540 --> 04:20.820]  I'm going to talk about a drip system with emitters for each plant, and we're going to
[04:20.820 --> 04:25.140]  talk about a water wand and a reservoir and a pump style setup.
[04:25.140 --> 04:28.820]  Once I get into it, it will be more clear which setup is best for you.
[04:28.820 --> 04:30.320]  They've both got their benefits.
[04:30.320 --> 04:31.700]  They've both got their downfalls.
[04:31.700 --> 04:37.940]  Let's talk about benefits of using a drip watering or assisted watering system.
[04:37.940 --> 04:43.360]  One of the first obvious advantages or benefits to using a drip or auto watering or assisted
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.560]  watering system is that it simply makes watering more efficient and it takes less time, which
[04:48.560 --> 04:54.360]  will free up a grower to do things like work the canopy or defoliate or scout for bugs
[04:54.360 --> 04:57.440]  or simply clean up things that have been getting overlooked.
[04:57.440 --> 04:59.520]  Building an auto watering system will free up time.
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.200]  No matter how big your grow is, this should save you some time.
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.720]  That is the first benefit.
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.000]  In a large facility, this will free you up a lot of time.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.440]  If you've got a thousand plants, you'll go from spending all day watering plants to just
[05:12.440 --> 05:15.280]  a couple of hours watering every single plant.
[05:15.280 --> 05:17.040]  You'll have to mix up solution.
[05:17.040 --> 05:21.400]  It's probably 250 to maybe 1000 gallons of water in some facilities.
[05:21.400 --> 05:22.400]  You have to mix it.
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.400]  You have to adjust the pH.
[05:23.400 --> 05:25.360]  You got to make sure your PPMs are good.
[05:25.360 --> 05:27.480]  You got to write down everything you put in there.
[05:27.480 --> 05:28.480]  Make sure your filter is clean.
[05:28.480 --> 05:32.360]  And then you hit go on the pump and you turn the valve for the right room and make sure
[05:32.360 --> 05:33.800]  that water pumps into the right room.
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.460]  And then while it's pumping, you run up and down the rows and make sure that each emitter
[05:37.460 --> 05:38.560]  is spraying out some water.
[05:38.560 --> 05:41.360]  And as long as every plant's getting water, you're good.
[05:41.360 --> 05:44.000]  You let it spray until all that water is empty.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.400]  While those plants are getting fed, you walk through and you make sure all the emitters
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.440]  are working, but also be looking for pests, be looking for powdery mildew, be looking
[05:51.440 --> 05:53.800]  for something that just doesn't look right.
[05:53.800 --> 05:54.840]  Find the problem in the room.
[05:54.840 --> 05:57.680]  There's always something that can be fixed or corrected.
[05:57.680 --> 06:01.720]  Be in the room looking for that while the sprinklers are running.
[06:01.720 --> 06:03.800]  Also catch a little bit of the water.
[06:03.800 --> 06:06.120]  Catch some of the runoff that comes out of the plants.
[06:06.120 --> 06:09.200]  The stuff that comes out of the bottom of the pots, gather that.
[06:09.200 --> 06:10.680]  Measure the pH.
[06:11.000 --> 06:13.240]  Measure the EC of that and start writing that down.
[06:13.240 --> 06:17.400]  And in the future, we've talked about this, we can diagnose problems by what you have
[06:17.400 --> 06:18.400]  written down.
[06:18.400 --> 06:19.920]  We talked about in the journaling episode.
[06:19.920 --> 06:22.520]  So while the sprinklers are running, that's all you need to be doing.
[06:22.520 --> 06:24.960]  Checking on the plants and catching a little bit of water.
[06:24.960 --> 06:29.640]  Now we've freed up a lot of time to work the canopy, check for bugs, do some defoliating.
[06:29.640 --> 06:31.560]  You don't have to spend all day watering.
[06:31.560 --> 06:34.920]  And while the plants are getting watered, we're actually in there looking for bugs and
[06:34.920 --> 06:36.720]  making sure the emitters are working.
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.640]  So we've freed up a lot of time and we're still getting plenty of work done while we're
[06:40.640 --> 06:41.640]  watering.
[06:41.640 --> 06:45.480]  Another advantage to having an automated or assisted watering system is this will make
[06:45.480 --> 06:47.960]  sure that all of your plants get evenly watered.
[06:47.960 --> 06:51.120]  You won't have one plant that got two pitchers of water dumped on it because somebody got
[06:51.120 --> 06:54.720]  a text message in the middle of watering and the rest of the plants only got one pitcher
[06:54.720 --> 06:55.720]  of water.
[06:55.720 --> 06:59.320]  You won't get a row of plants that got skipped because you were doing a job and then you
[06:59.320 --> 07:02.200]  saw something that had to be fixed and you went and corrected that and then came back
[07:02.200 --> 07:05.360]  and moved on to the next row and totally forgot to water a row.
[07:05.360 --> 07:06.600]  Things like that won't happen.
[07:06.600 --> 07:08.740]  The plants will get evenly watered.
[07:08.740 --> 07:12.220]  This will also help reduce waste and water and nutrients.
[07:12.220 --> 07:16.400]  When you're running a large facility, you're using a lot of water and a lot of nutrients.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.240]  This will help reduce waste.
[07:18.240 --> 07:20.920]  And this will also help you save on nutrients.
[07:20.920 --> 07:26.020]  You won't have a an employee spraying like I said earlier, two gallons into this plant,
[07:26.020 --> 07:30.160]  three gallons into this pot, four gallons into this one when they all honestly only
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.260]  needed to, they'll be consistent and you won't have guys wasting water, which is wasting
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.260]  nutrients.
[07:36.260 --> 07:39.820]  All right, another thing that will help, not only are they going to get the same amount
[07:39.820 --> 07:42.720]  of water, but they will get evenly watered.
[07:42.720 --> 07:45.380]  You won't have a guy just watering one spot of the plant.
[07:45.380 --> 07:48.860]  What I've seen a lot is when you have a crew watering plants with watering wands and it
[07:48.860 --> 07:52.640]  takes them all day to water the whole room, they start working and then eventually they
[07:52.640 --> 07:55.820]  just set the tip of the wand right on the plant, right on the soil, and they just hit
[07:55.820 --> 07:56.820]  go.
[07:56.820 --> 07:57.820]  They know how long they got to count.
[07:57.820 --> 07:59.580]  It's about 30, 45 seconds.
[07:59.580 --> 08:01.940]  You count and then the plant will be sufficiently watered.
[08:01.940 --> 08:03.380]  Then you move on to the next one.
[08:03.500 --> 08:06.020]  The type of shit won't happen if you use emitters.
[08:06.020 --> 08:09.620]  The guy won't set his water wand right there and water that one circle real heavy.
[08:09.620 --> 08:12.100]  The emitter will spray the entire surface.
[08:12.100 --> 08:13.860]  You'll get water throughout that whole pot.
[08:13.860 --> 08:18.500]  The roots will grow through the whole entire space of the container and all of the media,
[08:18.500 --> 08:21.340]  not just down low where all the water got saturated.
[08:21.340 --> 08:22.340]  So that's a big advantage.
[08:22.340 --> 08:23.820]  They'll get evenly watered.
[08:23.820 --> 08:26.060]  They'll get watered all the way through where they need to be.
[08:26.060 --> 08:30.780]  They'll get saturated and it will reduce your amount of waste.
[08:30.780 --> 08:35.100]  Another advantage to using one of these systems is that the emitters and the water wand actually
[08:35.100 --> 08:37.780]  do add a little bit of oxygen to the water.
[08:37.780 --> 08:39.740]  All of those bubbles are a good thing.
[08:39.740 --> 08:42.020]  The more oxygen in your water, the better.
[08:42.020 --> 08:44.300]  The more oxygen in your root zone, the better.
[08:44.300 --> 08:46.180]  The roots love the oxygen.
[08:46.180 --> 08:48.760]  So the emitters, they put out that little mist.
[08:48.760 --> 08:49.760]  Those are little bubbles.
[08:49.760 --> 08:53.260]  There's a lot of air in there, a lot of air making it a lot of space between the bubbles
[08:53.260 --> 08:56.200]  means there's a lot of air making it down into the root zone.
[08:56.200 --> 08:59.580]  Even the watering wands, they make a couple of nice little shower patterns.
[08:59.580 --> 09:01.740]  Those get a lot of air down into the root zone.
[09:01.740 --> 09:02.740]  That is very helpful.
[09:02.740 --> 09:04.260]  The plants do enjoy that.
[09:04.260 --> 09:09.420]  You can also add an air pump if you want to add some sort of air stones to your reservoir
[09:09.420 --> 09:10.500]  or to your trash can.
[09:10.500 --> 09:11.860]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[09:11.860 --> 09:13.280]  You can add oxygen to it.
[09:13.280 --> 09:15.020]  The plants will thank you for it.
[09:15.020 --> 09:18.620]  You can never go wrong adding more oxygen to the water in my opinion.
[09:18.620 --> 09:24.380]  All right, those are the basic advantages to using an automated system.
[09:24.380 --> 09:29.300]  Using an automated system or a drip system or an assisted watering system is not an excuse
[09:30.020 --> 09:31.020]  for laziness.
[09:31.020 --> 09:34.620]  Like I said earlier, there's plenty to inspect and look at and check on while the watering
[09:34.620 --> 09:36.300]  system is happening.
[09:36.300 --> 09:39.180]  You can also inspect the watering system itself.
[09:39.180 --> 09:42.020]  You need to make sure there are no leaks, make sure the filter is clean, make sure the
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.700]  emitters are spraying.
[09:43.700 --> 09:44.980]  Where is the water draining to?
[09:44.980 --> 09:46.360]  Do you have a drain set up?
[09:46.360 --> 09:47.360]  Is that clogged?
[09:47.360 --> 09:49.220]  Are you getting water all over the floor?
[09:49.220 --> 09:53.740]  There are so many other tasks available that you just made time to get done by creating
[09:53.740 --> 09:55.860]  this drip system.
[09:56.300 --> 10:00.660]  Sometimes people have an automated system or a drip system set up to water the plants
[10:00.660 --> 10:03.820]  for when they go on vacation or if they've got to leave for an extended amount of time
[10:03.820 --> 10:06.660]  or if they've got an emergency or something.
[10:06.660 --> 10:10.300]  Imagine being sick and you're not able to water your plants.
[10:10.300 --> 10:12.860]  One time I had the flu real bad and I couldn't even stand up.
[10:12.860 --> 10:14.740]  Every time I stood up I would puke.
[10:14.740 --> 10:18.200]  It was a real challenge watering the garden that day for a couple of days.
[10:18.200 --> 10:21.340]  If I had an auto watering system, I could have just filled up my reservoir and then
[10:21.340 --> 10:24.020]  hit the button and those plants would have got watered and I could have went back to
[10:24.020 --> 10:28.100]  bed and not felt like shit for those hours it took me to water my plants.
[10:28.100 --> 10:29.100]  That's just kind of a random use.
[10:29.100 --> 10:31.860]  I'm just trying to throw out examples of why they're useful.
[10:31.860 --> 10:35.020]  Imagine if you wanted to go away, you wanted to go to Vegas for a few days and have a little
[10:35.020 --> 10:36.020]  bit of fun.
[10:36.020 --> 10:38.660]  You want to go on a fish tour for a week and have a little bit of fun, but you've got a
[10:38.660 --> 10:40.400]  crop at home that might die.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.000]  You don't trust anybody around to water it.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.380]  You don't need anybody coming in and out of your house.
[10:44.380 --> 10:46.140]  Maybe nobody else knows about your grow.
[10:46.140 --> 10:50.020]  You can set up a small watering system that will take care of those plants for you while
[10:50.020 --> 10:51.500]  you're gone.
[10:51.500 --> 10:57.540]  Also, auto watering systems could be helpful for people with physical limitations.
[10:57.540 --> 11:01.480]  Imagine if you're unable to lift a lot of water, you can't carry the water.
[11:01.480 --> 11:02.900]  Maybe your mobility is limited.
[11:02.900 --> 11:06.000]  Maybe you're in a wheelchair and you can't roll between each plant.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.980]  Maybe you've got limited mobility in some sort of way.
[11:08.980 --> 11:12.740]  I don't know what's going on, but this could be a way that you can grow some cannabis.
[11:12.740 --> 11:16.500]  You can have somebody come help you once a week, maybe set up your grow for you, get
[11:16.500 --> 11:20.260]  your drip system set up, get your reservoir set up, and then all you have to do is go
[11:20.260 --> 11:23.300]  in there and press the button and you can water those plants every day.
[11:23.300 --> 11:26.820]  And that way you can tend to your garden, you can minimize the physical work that has
[11:26.820 --> 11:31.260]  to be done, and you can still grow a little bit of cannabis for yourself if you're physically
[11:31.260 --> 11:32.260]  limited.
[11:32.260 --> 11:35.460]  So this would be useful for that sort of a situation.
[11:35.460 --> 11:39.180]  Also, these setups are customizable and expandable.
[11:39.180 --> 11:42.860]  Everything I'm going to teach you is just from my limited experience building drip systems
[11:42.860 --> 11:45.540]  in commercial grows and in home grows.
[11:45.540 --> 11:46.860]  Don't think that these are rules.
[11:46.860 --> 11:49.120]  You can expand on this any way you'd like.
[11:49.120 --> 11:51.960]  You can customize this any way you'd like.
[11:51.960 --> 11:54.240]  I may be totally wrong for your setup.
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.600]  Maybe I've sparked some ideas.
[11:55.600 --> 11:56.960]  Maybe I've started an argument.
[11:56.960 --> 12:00.360]  I'm just trying to show you what I'm doing and get you started, and then you can build
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.560]  it perfectly for your grow.
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.040]  It's honestly easier than you might think to build an auto watering or an assisted watering
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.520]  system.
[12:08.520 --> 12:13.680]  The first step to building anything or upgrading anything in your grow is to have a plan.
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.520]  Do you have a solid plan?
[12:15.520 --> 12:17.160]  Can you put this plan on paper?
[12:17.160 --> 12:19.080]  If so, write it down.
[12:19.080 --> 12:20.080]  Have a plan.
[12:20.080 --> 12:23.200]  Let's see what you're thinking so that you can share it and we can work on it together
[12:23.200 --> 12:24.720]  and we both know the goal.
[12:24.720 --> 12:25.960]  So have a plan.
[12:25.960 --> 12:27.200]  Have a goal.
[12:27.200 --> 12:28.680]  And also have a reason.
[12:28.680 --> 12:30.120]  Why are you doing this?
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.720]  So what's your purpose?
[12:31.720 --> 12:34.400]  Why are you trying to build a watering system?
[12:34.400 --> 12:35.400]  Now you know why?
[12:35.400 --> 12:36.400]  Okay.
[12:36.400 --> 12:37.400]  What's your goal?
[12:37.400 --> 12:38.400]  Are you trying to make it easier?
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.400]  You're trying to be able to go on vacation?
[12:39.400 --> 12:40.400]  There we go.
[12:40.400 --> 12:42.600]  Now you know why you're doing it and what your goal is.
[12:42.600 --> 12:45.360]  Now let's build a plan on how to do it.
[12:45.360 --> 12:47.580]  Let's think about how many plants you want to water.
[12:47.580 --> 12:48.680]  Are you watering one light?
[12:48.880 --> 12:49.880]  Do you have nine?
[12:49.880 --> 12:50.880]  Do you have 12?
[12:50.880 --> 12:51.880]  Do you have 16 plants?
[12:51.880 --> 12:53.280]  Are you trying to water a whole bunch of stuff?
[12:53.280 --> 12:57.040]  Do you have a four by eight table with maybe 12 or 24 plants in there?
[12:57.040 --> 13:00.320]  Do you have a whole row of shit with 125 plants?
[13:00.320 --> 13:02.160]  Let's think about how many sites we're going to need.
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.480]  How many emitters do we need?
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.160]  Let's also think about are we going to use emitters or do we want to use a water wand?
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.560]  If you've got a small system and you like being interactive with the plants, a water
[13:11.560 --> 13:13.280]  wand is not a bad idea.
[13:13.280 --> 13:14.280]  It's always nice and personal.
[13:14.280 --> 13:18.160]  If you're going from hand watering to a water wand, you're still going to save time and you're
[13:18.160 --> 13:20.200]  still going to get that interactive feeling with your plants.
[13:20.200 --> 13:22.760]  You're going to be in there touching each plant, watering each plant.
[13:22.760 --> 13:24.840]  You'll get near each plant with the water wand.
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.080]  You'll have to move the leaves off the bottom surface.
[13:27.080 --> 13:29.600]  You can get to the soil and then you'll have to water.
[13:29.600 --> 13:31.360]  You'll still get to play with the plants if you use the wand.
[13:31.360 --> 13:33.320]  If you've got a small system, that's a great way to go.
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.440]  If you've got a bigger system, I would definitely recommend using the emitters.
[13:37.440 --> 13:42.220]  So once you've made your decision on the water wand or the emitters, then it's time to draw
[13:42.220 --> 13:46.240]  and design and actually build your watering system.
[13:46.320 --> 13:50.840]  I'm going to start with building a watering wand and a can watering setup.
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.520]  This is real simple.
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.920]  This is what I would recommend for a small to medium sized home grow or a small commercial
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.120]  grow or maybe a small or large bedroom for a commercial grow.
[14:02.120 --> 14:03.720]  But this is how I would do it.
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.920]  For my reservoir, I use a Brute trash can from the hardware store.
[14:07.920 --> 14:09.800]  It's a brand new, cleaned out trash can.
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.240]  I think it's a 25 or 32 gallon.
[14:12.240 --> 14:14.080]  I think it's a 32 gallon.
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.320]  Looks like a Rubbermaid trash can.
[14:15.400 --> 14:17.280]  It says Brute right on the side of it.
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.760]  I measure it out to where 10, 15, 20, and 25 gallons go so I know exactly how far I'm
[14:22.760 --> 14:23.760]  filling it.
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.480]  At the hardware store right next to these big trash cans, they sell the little wheels
[14:27.480 --> 14:29.140]  that attach to the bottom.
[14:29.140 --> 14:30.140]  Get those wheels.
[14:30.140 --> 14:33.200]  Now you can fill your can up and you can roll it to wherever you need it.
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.200]  You can get it closer to the plants or you can get it over to the nutrients.
[14:36.200 --> 14:40.320]  It's just much easier to handle when you've got that thing on wheels.
[14:40.320 --> 14:46.680]  I found that sometimes it can be hard to fill this big ass trash can because your bathtub,
[14:46.680 --> 14:49.040]  the fucking, what is it?
[14:49.040 --> 14:50.720]  The bathtub water comes out real low.
[14:50.720 --> 14:53.480]  I don't know the word for that thing where the bathtub water comes out.
[14:53.480 --> 14:55.960]  The bathtub water, the fucking faucet.
[14:55.960 --> 14:56.960]  There we go.
[14:56.960 --> 14:57.960]  That thing is real low, right?
[14:57.960 --> 14:59.960]  It's down there by the bathtub so it could fill the bathtub.
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.640]  Then up top, the shower head's up real high and you can only adjust the angle so much
[15:03.640 --> 15:07.880]  unless you got the kind that comes off and you got the masturbator shower head.
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.840]  Otherwise, you're going to have a hard time getting the water into this reservoir.
[15:12.840 --> 15:19.160]  At the hardware store, I found a thing that is used for washing your dog.
[15:19.160 --> 15:24.120]  The dog washer screws in where the shower head goes and then it adds an extra port with
[15:24.120 --> 15:25.120]  a hose coming off.
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.080]  So you take off the shower head, you screw in the dog washer, then you screw the shower
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.080]  head right back on.
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.920]  It only adds about an inch worth of length onto it.
[15:30.920 --> 15:32.460]  I don't even notice that.
[15:32.460 --> 15:34.640]  But then it's got a port coming off the side.
[15:34.640 --> 15:37.720]  That's where this dog washer hose comes off of.
[15:37.720 --> 15:41.320]  This other dog washer hose has a shower head on it with an on and off switch.
[15:41.320 --> 15:47.280]  So you basically turn on the shower and then the water starts coming out of this dog washer.
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.000]  Basically the dog washer is just a shower head on a fucking hose so that you can move
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  it.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  You can drop that right into your reservoir and you can fill it up.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.560]  It makes it so much easier for me because my shower, it wouldn't spray into the reservoir
[15:59.560 --> 16:02.960]  without hitting the floor and the bathtub one is way too low.
[16:02.960 --> 16:06.480]  Right now I feel like I'm trying to describe something crazy and I probably sound like
[16:06.480 --> 16:09.120]  a crazy person, but once you get to this point, you're going to go, Oh, that's what
[16:09.120 --> 16:10.120]  he meant.
[16:10.120 --> 16:12.520]  This one's eight feet off the ground and this one's two feet off the ground.
[16:12.520 --> 16:16.520]  My trash can is about four feet tall, so I get it.
[16:16.520 --> 16:19.400]  Also I should mention this thing didn't mess with my shower at all.
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.160]  Once you pop off the hose for the dog washer, your shower just becomes a normal shower.
[16:24.160 --> 16:26.240]  It won't disrupt your shower setup at all.
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.520]  I do recommend that you remove the dog washer attachment, the little, the whole hose part,
[16:30.520 --> 16:32.740]  just take it off up there at the port.
[16:32.740 --> 16:36.280]  Because if you leave it hanging for too long, that tension that it creates just from gravity
[16:37.080 --> 16:40.200]  just swinging there for so long after a while, it will develop a leak right there where it
[16:40.200 --> 16:41.200]  connects.
[16:41.200 --> 16:42.200]  So that's my advice.
[16:42.200 --> 16:44.520]  You guys, it's going to be so much easier to fill your reservoir.
[16:44.520 --> 16:47.800]  I also use this thing to clean things because my shower head in that shower doesn't come
[16:47.800 --> 16:48.800]  off.
[16:48.800 --> 16:49.800]  It's, it's attached to the wall.
[16:49.800 --> 16:50.800]  It's a fixed.
[16:50.800 --> 16:52.920]  So I needed one that I could pull off and I just clean stuff with it.
[16:52.920 --> 16:55.480]  I kind of use it like a little dishwasher and I just wash a bunch of shit.
[16:55.480 --> 16:57.200]  I put a thing in the bottom of that shower.
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.380]  So nothing goes down the.
[17:01.380 --> 17:02.660]  I guess that's a random side note.
[17:02.660 --> 17:05.820]  You guys be versatile, be a fucking MacGyver in your grow room.
[17:05.820 --> 17:08.100]  You don't always have to buy something that says grow room on it.
[17:08.100 --> 17:10.900]  You don't always have to buy something from one of the grow companies.
[17:10.900 --> 17:14.680]  It doesn't always have to come from Hydro Farm or Sun Systems or something like that.
[17:14.680 --> 17:17.700]  You can reappropriate different items.
[17:17.700 --> 17:21.380]  I just used a dog washer to clean my pots and fill my reservoir.
[17:21.380 --> 17:22.380]  And guess what I also did.
[17:22.380 --> 17:24.020]  I cleaned the dog with it.
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.020]  All right.
[17:25.020 --> 17:28.780]  I better stay focused because I've got a lot of notes and I'm only through the first page
[17:28.780 --> 17:29.780]  here.
[17:29.780 --> 17:30.780]  Let's keep going.
[17:30.780 --> 17:35.060]  Uh, the dog washer, the next part, if you're using RO, you'll need to get the water into
[17:35.060 --> 17:37.900]  the reservoir that you can drop your Monty pump into.
[17:37.900 --> 17:40.720]  We're going to talk about a Monty pump here in just a minute.
[17:40.720 --> 17:46.020]  But if you're using RO water for either system, the water wand or the emitter system, you're
[17:46.020 --> 17:50.580]  going to need a way to get that water into your reservoir that we're able to get a pump
[17:50.580 --> 17:54.340]  into that we can mix the nutrients into and then feed the plants from there.
[17:54.340 --> 17:57.100]  So you may already have it pumping into a large reservoir.
[17:57.100 --> 17:58.500]  I'm not sure what you've got set up.
[17:58.500 --> 18:01.940]  I have no idea what your grow looks like now, but you're going to need to collect that RO
[18:01.940 --> 18:02.940]  water.
[18:03.940 --> 18:08.500]  You're going to need to get that into this big reservoir that will then feed to the plant.
[18:08.500 --> 18:11.660]  So think about that while you're designing your setup.
[18:11.660 --> 18:16.340]  Getting the source water to the reservoir is something that is often overlooked by grow
[18:16.340 --> 18:19.140]  room designers, by contractors.
[18:19.140 --> 18:21.300]  Everyone's like, so then we run the water from the res to the plants.
[18:21.300 --> 18:23.100]  And then you go, where does that water come from?
[18:23.100 --> 18:25.940]  And they go, Oh shit, we never piped water into here.
[18:25.940 --> 18:29.420]  So I'm just trying to remind you now, think about how you're going to get either your
[18:29.420 --> 18:34.780]  municipal water or your RO water into your reservoir so that we can mix it up and then
[18:34.780 --> 18:36.580]  finally get it to these plants.
[18:36.580 --> 18:37.580]  All right.
[18:37.580 --> 18:41.700]  So we've got the water to our trash can, which is, we're going to be calling that a reservoir
[18:41.700 --> 18:42.700]  now.
[18:42.700 --> 18:43.700]  That is now a reservoir.
[18:43.700 --> 18:45.500]  Maybe you're using a fancy expensive reservoir.
[18:45.500 --> 18:48.780]  That's up to you, whatever you want to budget for, whatever you can fit through the door.
[18:48.780 --> 18:51.780]  Some of those reservoirs don't fit through the door.
[18:51.780 --> 18:53.540]  Make sure it fits through your doorway.
[18:53.540 --> 18:55.060]  Make sure you can get it into your grow space.
[18:55.060 --> 18:58.120]  So get your res, get it filled with water.
[18:58.120 --> 19:00.120]  You know how much water is in there.
[19:00.120 --> 19:02.120]  Now this is how I get the water to the plants.
[19:02.120 --> 19:04.080]  I get a small sump pump.
[19:04.080 --> 19:07.280]  The grow stores carry the pump called the Mondi that I keep talking about.
[19:07.280 --> 19:09.800]  It's a Mondi half horsepower sump pump.
[19:09.800 --> 19:15.400]  Those pumps are great because they come with a three quarter inch garden hose grommet attached
[19:15.400 --> 19:16.400]  to it.
[19:16.400 --> 19:18.920]  All you have to do is screw on a garden hose and you're ready to rock.
[19:18.920 --> 19:20.480]  So I like those Mondi pumps.
[19:20.480 --> 19:23.080]  You've got a trash can on wheels with the Mondi pump in it.
[19:23.080 --> 19:28.760]  I attach a standard garden hose based on the length that you need to reach your plants.
[19:28.760 --> 19:32.320]  Remember the can's on wheels so we can move it, but also the pump needs to be plugged
[19:32.320 --> 19:33.640]  in.
[19:33.640 --> 19:35.000]  You may need an extension cord.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.640]  You may need a longer hose.
[19:36.640 --> 19:38.960]  This is where you've got to do thinking on your own.
[19:38.960 --> 19:42.040]  Are you going to roll that can down the aisle with you or are you going to have a whole
[19:42.040 --> 19:45.360]  bunch of hose to coil up and drag that hose all over the place?
[19:45.360 --> 19:47.440]  Where is your electricity for the pump coming from?
[19:47.440 --> 19:49.000]  Those are things to keep in mind right now.
[19:49.400 --> 19:53.640]  You've got a rolling can that's marked for volume so you know how much water is in it.
[19:53.640 --> 19:55.480]  You've got a Mondi pump.
[19:55.480 --> 19:57.320]  It's the half horsepower Mondi pump.
[19:57.320 --> 19:58.320]  They're yellow.
[19:58.320 --> 19:59.600]  They're really common at the grow store.
[19:59.600 --> 20:04.040]  If you search Mondi sump pump half horsepower, you'll find it.
[20:04.040 --> 20:05.160]  It pops up on Amazon.
[20:05.160 --> 20:06.160]  It's all over the internet.
[20:06.160 --> 20:07.480]  It's at every grow store.
[20:07.480 --> 20:08.480]  These are easy to find.
[20:08.480 --> 20:10.400]  You've got your rolling can marked for volume.
[20:10.400 --> 20:11.400]  You've got your pump in there.
[20:11.400 --> 20:13.700]  You've got your regular garden hose coming off of there.
[20:13.700 --> 20:17.480]  Now you need some way to control the flow and direct the water because once you plug
[20:17.480 --> 20:20.520]  in that pump, the water is just going to shoot out of the hose.
[20:20.520 --> 20:21.640]  There's going to be no control of it.
[20:21.640 --> 20:22.640]  You can't turn it off.
[20:22.640 --> 20:23.640]  You can't stop it.
[20:23.640 --> 20:26.640]  You can crimp the hose, but other than that, it's just going to keep flowing.
[20:26.640 --> 20:30.160]  So we need some way to control this water.
[20:30.160 --> 20:32.600]  This part is where we get the water wand.
[20:32.600 --> 20:34.640]  It's basically the thing at the end of the hose.
[20:34.640 --> 20:38.040]  Remember when your old man would be out there watering the lawn, got the beer in one hand,
[20:38.040 --> 20:41.760]  cigarette in the other, and that sprayer, just watering the lawn, just spraying.
[20:41.760 --> 20:42.760]  The lawn was wet.
[20:42.760 --> 20:45.240]  He's just out there spraying because he didn't want to be around everybody.
[20:45.240 --> 20:46.640]  He's just out there watering.
[20:46.640 --> 20:49.120]  Remember that thing that he had to water the lawn with?
[20:49.120 --> 20:51.600]  It's basically that thing, but longer.
[20:51.600 --> 20:56.200]  It's got a longer nozzle on it that you use to aim the water and control it to get into
[20:56.200 --> 20:58.120]  the pot so that you're not just spraying randomly.
[20:58.120 --> 20:59.320]  It directs it into the pots.
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.560]  It's got an adjustable shower head on it.
[21:02.560 --> 21:03.560]  You could put it on fan.
[21:03.560 --> 21:05.200]  You could put it on shower.
[21:05.200 --> 21:06.200]  There's mist.
[21:06.200 --> 21:07.200]  There's always flood.
[21:07.200 --> 21:08.800]  There's just a bunch of different settings on it.
[21:08.800 --> 21:10.620]  I usually like the shower version.
[21:10.620 --> 21:14.600]  If you want it to go faster, take off that, unscrew the cover that changes the settings,
[21:14.600 --> 21:16.440]  and it'll just come out real hard.
[21:16.440 --> 21:17.720]  We call that the dump truck.
[21:17.720 --> 21:18.720]  Just let it just flow.
[21:18.720 --> 21:19.920]  Just cut down the flow.
[21:19.920 --> 21:23.420]  It's still useful because you use that water wand as an off and on switch, and it reaches
[21:23.420 --> 21:24.420]  into the plant.
[21:24.420 --> 21:27.640]  It's got a nice extended arm, so that's what that's for.
[21:27.640 --> 21:29.840]  Use that thing, the water wand.
[21:29.840 --> 21:32.340]  Basically, you can get them on Amazon.
[21:32.340 --> 21:33.840]  You can get them at the grocery store.
[21:33.840 --> 21:36.080]  You can get them at the hardware store.
[21:36.080 --> 21:37.760]  Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.720]  You can get these water wands in a lot of different styles.
[21:40.720 --> 21:45.000]  One thing I think is you really get what you pay for when it comes to a water wand.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.520]  If you get a cheapo, it's going to fall apart.
[21:47.520 --> 21:50.560]  The off and on trigger is going to break on you really quickly.
[21:50.560 --> 21:54.680]  If you get a good expensive one, you'll feel the difference in the quality, in the trigger,
[21:54.680 --> 21:57.360]  and the off and on switch, and the overall construction.
[21:57.360 --> 22:00.060]  You'll just be able to tell it's better made, and it will last you longer.
[22:00.060 --> 22:01.880]  Keep in mind that some of them are adjustable.
[22:01.880 --> 22:05.380]  A lot of times where they're adjustable, they like to become leakable.
[22:05.380 --> 22:06.420]  Some of them are too short.
[22:06.420 --> 22:07.720]  Some of them are too long.
[22:07.720 --> 22:11.120]  I like the kind that you can pivot the head or not pivot, but at least change the angle
[22:11.120 --> 22:18.450]  of the head.
[22:18.450 --> 22:21.370]  Some of them are hard to squeeze now that I think about it.
[22:21.370 --> 22:26.290]  If you don't have good squeeze power, if you're not into squeezing a hard trigger, you might
[22:26.290 --> 22:29.090]  want to find one that takes a little less squeeze power.
[22:29.090 --> 22:31.130]  I like the one that's got the lever.
[22:31.130 --> 22:34.250]  You pull it up, and then it's on, and then you push it down, and it goes off.
[22:34.250 --> 22:36.610]  You adjust the flow by using that lever.
[22:36.610 --> 22:39.170]  How high up and down you go, it's not just a trigger.
[22:39.170 --> 22:41.410]  I turn it on to about three quarters of the way.
[22:41.410 --> 22:46.610]  I can get from this pot to this pot quickly enough where I don't even have to turn it
[22:46.610 --> 22:50.230]  off to where I don't feel like I spilled enough water on the floor or anywhere to actually
[22:50.230 --> 22:51.450]  be a problem.
[22:51.450 --> 22:55.450]  I've got it set to about three quarters, and I'm just water this plant, give it as long
[22:55.450 --> 22:58.330]  as it needs, and then just jump right over to this one without even turning it off.
[22:58.330 --> 23:01.610]  Then when I'm ready to go, when I'm done and I want to carry the wand back to the hose,
[23:01.610 --> 23:05.570]  I just hit that off switch all the way, and I'm not spraying water on the floor.
[23:05.570 --> 23:08.730]  Or if I've got to do some work on a plant, if I decide to defoliate that plant while
[23:08.730 --> 23:12.110]  I'm looking at it or reposition, I can just turn it off real easily.
[23:12.110 --> 23:13.530]  The water ones are really handy, you guys.
[23:13.530 --> 23:14.530]  That's my point.
[23:14.530 --> 23:16.690]  There's a lot of different varieties available.
[23:16.690 --> 23:20.630]  Go to the growth store, go to the hardware store, look at the one you like, or order
[23:20.630 --> 23:23.930]  the one that looks the best to you on Amazon.
[23:23.930 --> 23:29.570]  So basically, my auto-watering system with this water wand is I've got a trash can on
[23:29.570 --> 23:34.530]  wheels, I've marked it for volume, I fill it up to my desired level, I add and mix my
[23:34.530 --> 23:37.810]  nutrients, I pH my solution.
[23:37.810 --> 23:44.010]  That means I adjust the pH to about 6.4, 6.3, depending on what I'm feeding, what plants
[23:44.010 --> 23:46.010]  are getting fed, I adjust my pH.
[23:46.010 --> 23:50.170]  I assemble the pump and my wand, which means I've got a pump, I've got a hose, and I've
[23:50.170 --> 23:51.170]  got a water wand.
[23:51.170 --> 23:53.970]  If you want to put a little bit of plumber's tape in there or anywhere on any of those
[23:53.970 --> 23:57.610]  threads to make sure they seal up real well, feel free to do that.
[23:57.610 --> 24:01.450]  Then drop that pump into the water and plug it in, and you can water your plants in half
[24:01.450 --> 24:02.450]  the time.
[24:02.450 --> 24:07.470]  I may suggest that before you drop that pump into your reservoir that you're going to water
[24:07.470 --> 24:12.330]  plants with, maybe you put it in another container and run water through it just one time, just
[24:12.330 --> 24:16.170]  to see if there's any oils or anything left over, I don't know, maybe there's something
[24:16.170 --> 24:20.010]  in there from the manufacturing process that you don't want getting into your plants, maybe
[24:20.010 --> 24:21.370]  clean it off one time.
[24:21.370 --> 24:25.010]  I kind of recommend cleaning shit out one time before you use it in your grow anyway.
[24:25.010 --> 24:28.890]  So run some clean water through it, just make sure it's not going to get oil or anything
[24:28.890 --> 24:29.890]  in there.
[24:29.890 --> 24:32.810]  I've seen one of these pumps, not Amandi, it was a different brand, I saw it burn up
[24:32.810 --> 24:35.930]  in a reservoir and a bunch of oil came out of it and we saw it all float to the top of
[24:35.930 --> 24:36.930]  the water.
[24:36.930 --> 24:40.890]  If Brian and I weren't paying attention, we may have fed that water to the plants, could
[24:40.890 --> 24:43.330]  have fucked up an entire crop.
[24:43.330 --> 24:45.850]  So just a good idea to rinse that pump.
[24:45.850 --> 24:49.070]  I'm not saying it's got something on it, but it could.
[24:49.070 --> 24:52.670]  So put everything together, drop that pump into the water and plug it in.
[24:52.670 --> 24:56.550]  Now you can water your plants by picking up that water wand and squeezing the trigger
[24:56.550 --> 24:59.050]  and pointing it right into the pot of the plant.
[24:59.050 --> 25:01.970]  Now you don't have to go back to the reservoir between every plant, you don't have to carry
[25:01.970 --> 25:06.530]  a pitcher of water from the reservoir to the plant every time, which is trips back and
[25:06.530 --> 25:10.130]  forth, which is you spilling water, which is inconsistent watering, which is you getting
[25:10.130 --> 25:14.250]  in a rush, which is where a lot of problems can go wrong.
[25:14.250 --> 25:15.650]  You guys, excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[25:15.650 --> 25:19.090]  I'm trying not to do a lot of pausing and editing on this show, but my throat is kind
[25:19.090 --> 25:20.090]  of burning.
[25:20.090 --> 25:22.370]  So we're going to take a break here in a second, take a drink and a dab and we'll come back.
[25:22.370 --> 25:25.650]  But I've been talking a lot about consistency with auto watering.
[25:25.650 --> 25:29.690]  Here's a way to dial this in with your water wand.
[25:29.690 --> 25:30.690]  What were you watering with before?
[25:30.690 --> 25:31.690]  Were you using a pitcher?
[25:31.690 --> 25:32.690]  Were you using a jar?
[25:32.690 --> 25:36.050]  Were you using one of those fancy watering cans from Target?
[25:36.050 --> 25:38.810]  Whatever you were using, get your watering wand.
[25:38.810 --> 25:42.270]  Set that container on a table and set a timer or count.
[25:42.270 --> 25:45.250]  Just count because you're going to be doing this on your own in your head anyway, when
[25:45.250 --> 25:48.450]  you're out in the grow, when you get away from all the stuff and you got your earbuds
[25:48.450 --> 25:49.890]  and you're going to be doing it in your head.
[25:49.890 --> 25:54.770]  So get that container and use your water wand and just start filling it and count how long
[25:54.770 --> 25:55.770]  it takes.
[25:55.770 --> 25:57.730]  Count at your own pace, but count at the same pace all the time.
[25:57.730 --> 26:01.890]  You're not, if you count at one, two, three, four, five, make sure you always count like
[26:01.890 --> 26:02.890]  that.
[26:02.890 --> 26:05.690]  But if you count at one, two, you can count at your own pace right now.
[26:05.690 --> 26:06.690]  You're just measuring at your own thing.
[26:06.690 --> 26:08.650]  Just make sure you count the same all the time.
[26:09.490 --> 26:10.490]  So see how long it takes to fill it up.
[26:10.490 --> 26:14.690]  One, two, maybe it'll take 45 seconds to fill up that container.
[26:14.690 --> 26:18.090]  If that's the container you were using to water your plants, now you know it takes the
[26:18.090 --> 26:23.970]  count of 45 to water your plants with that water once you got to go stand there for 45,
[26:23.970 --> 26:28.730]  one, two, three, but make sure you're moving that water wand around the plants the whole
[26:28.730 --> 26:34.370]  time so that you're moistening all of the medium, the whole container needs to be evenly
[26:34.370 --> 26:35.370]  watered.
[26:35.370 --> 26:38.850]  So that's a great way to dial in how much water you're giving per plant with the water
[26:38.850 --> 26:40.410]  wand system.
[26:40.410 --> 26:46.810]  So our basic shopping list to set up this trash can water wand system is a trash can,
[26:46.810 --> 26:52.490]  wheels, a Mondi pump, a good hose, and a solid water wand.
[26:52.490 --> 26:58.050]  You should be able to set this up for around $200 depending on where you find the pump,
[26:58.050 --> 27:03.410]  how long of a hose you get, the quality of the water wand, and do you need the dog washer
[27:03.450 --> 27:07.010]  attachment to get that water to your reservoir.
[27:07.010 --> 27:12.410]  So for right around $200, you can be watering your plants with much more efficiency.
[27:12.410 --> 27:14.370]  You guys, my throat is mad at me.
[27:14.370 --> 27:16.610]  I'm going to press pause for a couple of seconds.
[27:16.610 --> 27:19.770]  I'm going to take a couple of gigantic dabs of this Cambrouillet sauce.
[27:19.770 --> 27:23.250]  I'm going to get some water and then I'll be back to talk about building a reservoir
[27:23.250 --> 28:20.980]  and emitter style drip system for your grow.
[28:20.980 --> 28:22.700]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[28:22.700 --> 28:25.420]  Let's talk about building an auto watering system.
[28:25.420 --> 28:30.540]  In a commercial facility, we try to automate as much as possible to allow for more canopy
[28:30.540 --> 28:35.820]  work, defoliation, bug scouting, whatever else needs to be done that day, a lot of cleaning,
[28:35.820 --> 28:38.500]  whatever else we come up with on the daily to-do list.
[28:38.500 --> 28:41.540]  We'd like to have time to get all of that stuff done.
[28:41.540 --> 28:46.620]  So I use a water wand and a can set up for our veg and moms in a large facility.
[28:46.620 --> 28:51.380]  But once we move into the flower rooms, every plant has an emitter or two for automated
[28:51.380 --> 28:53.940]  watering.
[28:53.940 --> 28:58.180]  Designing your watering system is going to vary greatly depending on your current grow
[28:58.180 --> 29:00.100]  setup and your ultimate goals.
[29:00.100 --> 29:03.300]  Remember earlier we talked about having goals.
[29:03.300 --> 29:07.160]  This setup should give you a good idea of how to start your design.
[29:07.160 --> 29:11.380]  You will need to modify and adjust and adapt to your situation.
[29:11.380 --> 29:12.900]  I don't know what your grow room looks like.
[29:12.900 --> 29:14.700]  I don't know what your room is shaped like.
[29:14.700 --> 29:16.540]  I don't know how many plants you've got.
[29:16.540 --> 29:21.260]  You may need to make some decisions on the fly because your grow rooms and the hardware
[29:21.260 --> 29:23.740]  store are going to be different than mine.
[29:23.740 --> 29:25.780]  I don't know what's available at your hardware store.
[29:25.780 --> 29:27.620]  Maybe you're not shopping on Amazon.
[29:27.620 --> 29:29.880]  I don't know what you've got access to that day.
[29:29.880 --> 29:33.820]  Maybe you live somewhere that aces the place and you can't go to Lowe's or Home Depot and
[29:33.820 --> 29:35.940]  they've got different stuff than what I recommend.
[29:35.940 --> 29:37.340]  You may need to do some adjusting.
[29:37.340 --> 29:42.060]  So this is just going to be a good guideline in my opinion.
[29:42.060 --> 29:44.300]  Now let's start with a little bit of a plan.
[29:44.300 --> 29:50.220]  How many plants do you plan on watering and how often do those plants need to be watered?
[29:50.220 --> 29:53.220]  How much water will that require?
[29:53.220 --> 29:57.340]  And now we need to start with a reservoir large enough to water the garden the amount
[29:57.340 --> 29:58.340]  of times.
[29:58.340 --> 29:59.420]  So let's say you're going on vacation.
[29:59.420 --> 30:03.060]  Let's just hypothetically say your goal is to get this through a week.
[30:03.060 --> 30:05.260]  You're leaving Monday, you'll be back Friday.
[30:05.260 --> 30:07.180]  You need the plants to survive through the week.
[30:07.180 --> 30:08.860]  How much water will that take?
[30:08.860 --> 30:15.020]  How many times are your plants going to be requiring water to last Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[30:15.020 --> 30:18.700]  Thursday, Friday, and you're probably not going to get to them until Saturday, right?
[30:18.700 --> 30:19.980]  So you get to water them Sunday.
[30:20.740 --> 30:25.140]  If you've got five full days, how many gallons of water do you need for those plants to survive?
[30:25.140 --> 30:30.180]  Make sure your reservoir that you select is large enough to handle that much water if
[30:30.180 --> 30:31.860]  that is your goal.
[30:31.860 --> 30:35.600]  If you plan on filling your reservoir every day and mixing nutrients and just feeding
[30:35.600 --> 30:40.460]  your daily feed, make sure it's big enough for one or two feeds and you should be just
[30:40.460 --> 30:41.460]  fine.
[30:41.460 --> 30:43.900]  But if you plan on leaving town, you're going to want a big reservoir.
[30:43.900 --> 30:45.820]  So that's why I'm talking about it now.
[30:45.820 --> 30:49.600]  So think about the reservoir size that you need.
[30:49.600 --> 30:51.480]  Maybe a small brute trash can is enough.
[30:51.480 --> 30:53.800]  Maybe you want 50 to 100 gallons.
[30:53.800 --> 30:54.800]  That's up to you.
[30:54.800 --> 30:56.600]  Also keep in mind, it's got to fit through the door.
[30:56.600 --> 30:58.460]  It's got to go somewhere in the house.
[30:58.460 --> 31:00.320]  It's got to get into your facility somehow.
[31:00.320 --> 31:03.200]  So make sure you've got room for a big ass reservoir.
[31:03.200 --> 31:06.720]  Those 250s, those square 250s, they don't fit through a standard door.
[31:06.720 --> 31:10.600]  So you need a roll up door or something to get that bitch in the facility.
[31:10.600 --> 31:15.040]  So keep in mind also that you're going to need to get water to this reservoir.
[31:15.040 --> 31:18.040]  And like I mentioned earlier, sometimes that's not as easy as it sounds.
[31:18.040 --> 31:21.600]  Now, if you've got a 250 gallon reservoir, that may end up in the garage.
[31:21.600 --> 31:25.720]  That may end up in an easier place to access and the grow may be down in the opposite end
[31:25.720 --> 31:26.720]  of the house in the basement.
[31:26.720 --> 31:28.280]  You're going to have to get that water.
[31:28.280 --> 31:30.320]  You're going to have to get water to the reservoir.
[31:30.320 --> 31:32.640]  Then you have to get it all the way back to the basement.
[31:32.640 --> 31:34.600]  Just think about these things.
[31:34.600 --> 31:38.640]  So it all starts with the reservoir and a way to get water into our res.
[31:38.640 --> 31:42.320]  Now you may need to heat or cool that res depending on where it is stored.
[31:42.320 --> 31:44.600]  If it's out in the garage, the temperatures are going to fluctuate.
[31:44.600 --> 31:46.080]  It's been 100 and something degrees here.
[31:46.080 --> 31:47.920]  That water would have been really hot.
[31:47.920 --> 31:51.840]  We would have wanted to cool it down in the winter here.
[31:51.840 --> 31:53.240]  Shit in the indoor facilities here.
[31:53.240 --> 31:54.240]  I'm heating water.
[31:54.240 --> 31:59.360]  It gets so cold outside that the water that comes in through the pipes is ridiculously
[31:59.360 --> 32:00.360]  cold.
[32:00.360 --> 32:01.440]  It comes in at like 50 degrees.
[32:01.440 --> 32:03.240]  Stick your hand in that 50 degree water.
[32:03.240 --> 32:04.240]  No thank you.
[32:04.240 --> 32:05.240]  It's so cold.
[32:05.240 --> 32:06.240]  It almost fucking hurts.
[32:06.240 --> 32:07.240]  We got to heat it up.
[32:07.240 --> 32:10.080]  We got to get that water around 70, 75 degrees before we feed it to the plants.
[32:10.080 --> 32:11.360]  That makes them much happier.
[32:11.360 --> 32:13.720]  If you're using a hydro system, yes, you do want your water cooler.
[32:13.720 --> 32:14.720]  Don't correct me there.
[32:14.720 --> 32:16.440]  We're just talking about this drip system for today.
[32:16.440 --> 32:18.280]  We want to get the water to the right temperature.
[32:18.280 --> 32:19.600]  You may need to heat or chill it.
[32:19.600 --> 32:23.000]  Get yourself a chiller or a water heater and be careful with those things.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.280]  Dial them in to the temperature that you do desire.
[32:26.280 --> 32:31.240]  Also, you may need a smaller pump inside of your large reservoir to help keep your nutrient
[32:31.240 --> 32:34.920]  solution mix properly and to prevent that water from getting stagnant.
[32:34.920 --> 32:37.600]  Just put a little like a fish tank pump or something in there just to keep the water
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.600]  moving around a little bit.
[32:38.600 --> 32:42.720]  All right, so now we've got a reservoir that we can mix our nutrients into.
[32:42.720 --> 32:45.920]  We can fill up with either RO water or municipal water.
[32:45.920 --> 32:47.200]  We can get water to it.
[32:47.200 --> 32:51.440]  Now, that's the first part is having a reservoir filled with water.
[32:51.440 --> 32:55.160]  Our next step, once again, we need a pump.
[32:55.160 --> 32:59.940]  Your pump size is going to depend on the amount of plants, the amount of emitters, and how
[32:59.940 --> 33:02.840]  far your water needs to travel to get to those plants.
[33:02.840 --> 33:08.400]  If you're going up, if you have to pump uphill, straight up, you need a much stronger pump
[33:08.400 --> 33:11.200]  than if you're just pumping horizontal.
[33:11.200 --> 33:13.320]  If you're pumping vertical, you need a stronger pump.
[33:13.320 --> 33:15.600]  It takes a lot of pressure to push water up.
[33:15.680 --> 33:20.480]  If you're just going horizontal or down, you can use a less powerful pump.
[33:20.480 --> 33:26.200]  Your pump is going to depend on, like I said, the distance and the amount of plants.
[33:26.200 --> 33:28.640]  The more emitters, you're going to need a stronger pump.
[33:28.640 --> 33:30.800]  Longer travel, stronger pump.
[33:30.800 --> 33:32.880]  Vertical climb, much stronger pump.
[33:32.880 --> 33:35.120]  You're going to have to think about this when you're designing your room.
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.920]  Do a little research on horsepowers of pumps.
[33:37.920 --> 33:42.160]  It's better to have too much pressure as opposed to too little pressure.
[33:42.160 --> 33:43.880]  Low pressure won't work at all.
[33:43.880 --> 33:46.960]  Too little pressure, those emitters basically regulate themselves.
[33:46.960 --> 33:49.440]  Unless you're going crazy, then you're going to blow it apart.
[33:49.440 --> 33:53.200]  Just a little bit too much pressure and those little emitters will regulate themselves and
[33:53.200 --> 33:54.880]  you'll be just fine.
[33:54.880 --> 33:56.360]  So far, it's pretty basic.
[33:56.360 --> 33:58.700]  You've got a pump and you've got a reservoir.
[33:58.700 --> 34:00.880]  Make sure that reservoir is fillable.
[34:00.880 --> 34:03.680]  Maybe if you've got a way to clean that would be a good idea also.
[34:03.680 --> 34:06.580]  Just keep that sort of stuff in mind from the beginning.
[34:06.580 --> 34:08.880]  This is where it starts getting into some work.
[34:08.880 --> 34:16.040]  I would run PVC from that submersible pump to an inline filter.
[34:16.040 --> 34:18.280]  So most of the time, this is how I do it.
[34:18.280 --> 34:22.400]  I run PVC coming up directly up off of the pump.
[34:22.400 --> 34:25.840]  Then you use 290 degrees to make it go back down.
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.640]  It comes up and then it goes around the edge of the reservoir or the trash can and then
[34:29.640 --> 34:31.080]  it goes just straight back down.
[34:31.080 --> 34:34.920]  Now you may need to add some distance here if your reservoir is wide or if your pump
[34:34.920 --> 34:38.480]  is in the middle and then it comes up and then you go a 90 degree and then you may have
[34:38.480 --> 34:41.960]  to go a couple feet to get off the edge of that reservoir and then you do another 90
[34:41.960 --> 34:43.800]  to go down toward the ground.
[34:43.800 --> 34:46.400]  Then on your way to the ground, that's where you're going to put that filter.
[34:46.400 --> 34:55.560]  That filter is going to be in the way.
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.220]  So that shine or whatever sediment you've got coming through the line, the thick stuff,
[34:59.220 --> 35:02.580]  will get caught by the inline filter and it won't make it down to your emitters and clog
[35:02.580 --> 35:04.140]  up your emitters.
[35:04.140 --> 35:08.460]  So now the PVC line that was coming to that filter was running down toward the ground.
[35:08.460 --> 35:12.420]  Just keep running that to the ground until you get to the floor and then use a 90 to
[35:12.420 --> 35:14.820]  point it whichever direction you need it.
[35:14.820 --> 35:19.220]  Or if you've got a long way to go or if you're going into another room, just simply use PVC
[35:19.220 --> 35:20.980]  to route it to where you need it.
[35:20.980 --> 35:25.580]  Just do some plumbing work, build yourself a little water line to wherever you need it.
[35:25.580 --> 35:27.860]  Use 90 degrees, 45 degree angles.
[35:27.860 --> 35:31.780]  Just make sure you prime and glue every spot carefully so that you don't get any leaks.
[35:31.780 --> 35:36.180]  So just build yourself a little pathway to get that water to where you need it.
[35:36.180 --> 35:41.420]  Now this PVC I'm talking about can vary in size based on your watering needs.
[35:41.420 --> 35:46.140]  Anywhere from one inch to one and a half inch to three inch PVC could be used depending
[35:46.140 --> 35:49.460]  on the size of your garden and how much water flow you need.
[35:49.460 --> 35:53.820]  If you're using a large facility, you may be pumping this water a long distance just
[35:53.820 --> 35:59.140]  from your reservoir all the way down the hallway, all the way to the grow room, around the corner,
[35:59.140 --> 36:01.800]  out to where it gets dispersed, then down to each table.
[36:01.800 --> 36:03.460]  You're going to need a stronger pump for that.
[36:03.460 --> 36:08.220]  So make sure your pump is equipped for how much water you're moving and the distance
[36:08.220 --> 36:09.660]  that it has to go.
[36:09.660 --> 36:14.220]  If you're going to set up different rooms with the same pump, just use ball valves so
[36:14.220 --> 36:15.900]  that you can turn off.
[36:15.900 --> 36:20.680]  So you'll have a, it'll come from the pump up to one valve, and then you'll have three
[36:20.680 --> 36:22.140]  on and off switches.
[36:22.140 --> 36:25.300]  And you just turn the ones off where you don't want the water to flow and the water off where
[36:25.300 --> 36:27.620]  you want it to go so you can select which room.
[36:27.620 --> 36:31.180]  So just use ball valves to control the flow to each room.
[36:31.180 --> 36:32.380]  Use T's and ball valves.
[36:32.380 --> 36:36.300]  And that way you can have one pump that you can water every room from, but you'll have
[36:36.300 --> 36:38.380]  to do one room at a time.
[36:38.380 --> 36:40.820]  Alright so, we've got a big reservoir.
[36:40.820 --> 36:44.040]  We have got a pump inside.
[36:44.040 --> 36:50.280]  That pump has hose coming off of it that gets us to a filter.
[36:50.280 --> 36:52.100]  That filter will save your life in the future by the way.
[36:52.100 --> 36:53.100]  It's going to save you so much trouble.
[36:53.100 --> 36:55.660]  So you've got a res with the pump leading to a filter.
[36:55.660 --> 36:59.500]  From the filter we've got PVC leading us to the plant area.
[36:59.500 --> 37:01.780]  Now this description is how I do tables.
[37:01.780 --> 37:06.520]  We can talk about building the tables and adjusting this to a floor plan or other options
[37:06.520 --> 37:08.400]  once we get the general idea down.
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.000]  But this is how I do it using greenhouse style irrigation tables.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.960]  The plants are in 3 gallon pots.
[37:13.960 --> 37:14.960]  They're in cocoa.
[37:14.960 --> 37:15.960]  They're sitting on tables.
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.960]  The tables are slightly slanted to where the water runs down to one end and it drains out
[37:19.960 --> 37:20.960]  of the other end.
[37:20.960 --> 37:27.760]  So I never have water sitting on the other end.
[37:27.760 --> 37:31.840]  So we've talked about getting the pump, pumping water into the room.
[37:31.840 --> 37:35.020]  Usually I've got the water coming into the room about 7 feet high.
[37:35.020 --> 37:36.180]  So it's above my head.
[37:36.180 --> 37:40.180]  I've got a pipe running horizontally across a lot of the facility.
[37:40.180 --> 37:42.100]  Just running water all over the place.
[37:42.100 --> 37:43.100]  Seven eight feet high.
[37:43.100 --> 37:46.120]  Then it comes into the grow room about seven or eight feet high.
[37:46.120 --> 37:47.120]  This is just for my setup.
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.940]  I'm telling you how we do it in a commercial facility.
[37:50.940 --> 37:51.940]  About eight feet high.
[37:51.940 --> 37:52.940]  The water.
[37:52.940 --> 37:53.940]  There's a water line.
[37:53.940 --> 37:54.940]  You can just see it.
[37:54.940 --> 37:55.940]  A PVC tube.
[37:55.940 --> 37:57.180]  This is a thick PVC tube because we're running a lot of water.
[37:57.180 --> 37:59.060]  Yours doesn't need to be this big.
[37:59.060 --> 38:03.780]  Then for each table there's a T coming off of that main line.
[38:03.780 --> 38:08.740]  So a T comes off and off of that T I use flex hose that fits off of that intersection
[38:08.740 --> 38:14.580]  and that flex hose arches from the eight foot, seven or eight foot spot above my head.
[38:14.580 --> 38:19.040]  It creates an arch down to the end of the table.
[38:19.040 --> 38:20.140]  Now that is out of my way.
[38:20.140 --> 38:23.180]  I can walk under that because it goes right at the end of the table.
[38:23.180 --> 38:24.180]  It just bends perfect.
[38:24.180 --> 38:25.900]  It's like I'm just walking under a little bridge.
[38:25.900 --> 38:26.900]  It's perfectly.
[38:26.900 --> 38:30.260]  So it's seven or eight feet above me and then it just arches to the end of the table where
[38:30.260 --> 38:44.470]  it comes to another T section.
[38:44.470 --> 38:49.970]  That piece of flex hose then reaches another T intersection where I have about a three
[38:49.970 --> 38:52.950]  foot section of PVC that lays on my table.
[38:52.950 --> 38:55.150]  My table is five or six feet wide.
[38:55.150 --> 39:00.270]  I use about a three, three and a half foot section to start building my table watering
[39:00.270 --> 39:01.270]  system.
[39:01.270 --> 39:09.490]  There is a T in the very center of this three foot section of PVC where my.
[39:09.490 --> 39:12.010]  So that PVC just rests freely on the table.
[39:12.010 --> 39:13.330]  It basically sits centered.
[39:13.330 --> 39:15.330]  It's not the width of the table, but it's close.
[39:15.330 --> 39:17.250]  The table is five or six feet long.
[39:17.250 --> 39:20.750]  This piece of PVC would be about three, three and a half feet long and it would sit the
[39:20.750 --> 39:25.310]  width of the table and that is basically the start of my water distribution.
[39:25.310 --> 39:31.610]  Now if you're doing multiple tables, here's an important detail between the flex hose
[39:31.610 --> 39:36.350]  and that T intersection where you meet the PVC, give yourself a ball valve to turn that
[39:36.350 --> 39:37.410]  off and on.
[39:37.410 --> 39:40.710]  So if you're going to water more than if you've got two or three tables in there, maybe you
[39:40.710 --> 39:44.250]  only want to water table one or table two or table three.
[39:44.250 --> 39:48.250]  If you've got ball valves to each table, you can turn off each table and you won't have
[39:48.250 --> 39:51.450]  to worry about watering the wrong table with the wrong nutrients.
[39:51.450 --> 39:53.350]  So that will come to your advantage.
[39:53.350 --> 39:56.510]  Wherever you can put a ball valve to control water.
[39:56.510 --> 40:01.030]  Why not do it wherever you can put a little union like a, if you, when you start building
[40:01.030 --> 40:04.650]  PVC stuff, you'll, you'll learn what unions are, wherever you can put a union.
[40:04.650 --> 40:06.830]  Why not do it to save yourself some time in the future.
[40:07.250 --> 40:09.070]  Think about ball valves and unions.
[40:09.070 --> 40:11.390]  Those will come into mind once you build a couple of these systems.
[40:11.390 --> 40:15.390]  If you've done some PVC building that already rings stuff to you, but it's just advanced
[40:15.390 --> 40:16.390]  stuff that's going to help you out.
[40:16.390 --> 41:16.420]  So now I've got my intersection where my water feeds, it leads into my table.
[41:16.420 --> 41:18.420]  I've got my ball valve so I could turn it off and on.
[41:18.420 --> 41:20.280]  Let's not forget that like I almost did.
[41:20.280 --> 41:23.020]  It branches off a foot and a half, maybe two feet on each side.
[41:40.260 --> 41:41.940]  Now onto that, you're going to.
[41:42.940 --> 41:58.740]  I know it sounds a little sketchy to start, but once you see how it works, it totally
[41:58.740 --> 42:00.060]  makes a lot of sense.
[42:00.060 --> 42:06.820]  So you need poly tubing, depending on the size of your grow, the PVC and the poly tubing
[42:06.820 --> 42:12.300]  you use may vary anywhere from a half of an inch to one and a half inches.
[42:12.300 --> 42:16.240]  You're just going to have to think about how much water you need to move and how big of
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.000]  a pump you want to use in your setup.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.800]  So to get back where we were, we've got our line coming off the wall.
[42:23.800 --> 42:27.740]  We've got our T intersection, then we've got our 90 degrees with our little inserts glued
[42:27.740 --> 42:29.520]  into there and everything is glued.
[42:29.520 --> 42:31.480]  Everything has been primed and glued all the way back to the wall.
[42:31.480 --> 42:34.060]  We're doing this as we go so we don't get any leaks.
[42:34.060 --> 42:35.060]  Everything is primed and glued.
[42:35.060 --> 43:06.050]  We've got our 90 degree angles pointing down, right down between the pots.
[43:06.050 --> 43:08.810]  So I'm going to run mine down the length of the table because that's what I'm doing.
[43:08.810 --> 43:10.270]  I'm going to get it down the table.
[43:10.270 --> 43:13.290]  Then I'm going to put two more of those 90 degree angles at the end.
[43:13.290 --> 43:14.290]  There's the 90 degree angle.
[43:14.290 --> 43:17.130]  You have to put an insert in one end of it, prime it and glue it.
[43:17.130 --> 43:18.730]  Then that pops into your poly tubing.
[43:18.730 --> 43:21.130]  You can either prime and glue that or put a hose clamp on there.
[43:21.130 --> 43:23.170]  I do both because that's where it's going to come undone.
[43:23.170 --> 43:26.390]  When two different kinds of materials meet, that's where the glue likes to fail.
[43:26.390 --> 43:27.390]  So I prime and glue it.
[43:27.390 --> 43:29.050]  I put a hose clamp on there.
[43:29.050 --> 43:33.210]  Then I just do another piece of PVC across the same length as the one I used at the other
[43:33.210 --> 43:35.010]  end, probably three feet long.
[43:35.010 --> 43:38.210]  Do another one and then do repeat my 90 degree angle again.
[43:38.210 --> 43:40.170]  And then I roll my poly tubing out to match.
[43:40.170 --> 43:42.010]  So now I've built a square.
[43:42.010 --> 43:44.610]  So now basically I've got water coming from the wet reservoir.
[43:44.610 --> 43:48.850]  It comes along the wall, comes into the room, comes from eight feet above me, branches off
[43:48.850 --> 43:52.890]  the wall, goes down the flex tubing, goes to the ball valve that I can turn off and
[43:52.890 --> 43:53.890]  on.
[43:53.890 --> 43:57.130]  Then it goes to the T section of PVC.
[43:57.130 --> 43:59.170]  Then it runs down the length of my table.
[43:59.170 --> 44:02.050]  Then it goes back and meets itself at that square because it cuts off.
[44:02.050 --> 44:03.850]  There's nowhere for the water to go.
[44:03.850 --> 44:06.010]  Now this helps create pressure.
[44:06.010 --> 44:09.810]  Instead of just having one line running down the middle with lines coming off of it, we've
[44:09.810 --> 44:11.850]  got a little bit of equalized pressure.
[44:11.850 --> 44:15.450]  And this will help spread the water out amongst the plants a little more evenly.
[44:15.450 --> 44:19.210]  Also since we've got such a long table, we'd rather have two lines coming off so that we
[44:19.210 --> 44:23.490]  can have emitters off of two different lines and not have really long spaghetti lines.
[44:23.490 --> 44:47.480]  We've just got two mains to pipe off of.
[44:47.480 --> 44:50.280]  Here is where having a solid plan will come in handy.
[44:50.280 --> 44:53.080]  Hopefully you drew all this out before we started building.
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.860]  Hopefully you measured twice, cut once before we laid out all the tubing.
[44:56.860 --> 44:58.080]  Hopefully everything went well with that.
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.160]  But now you really need to think about where you're going to place your plants.
[45:02.160 --> 45:07.200]  If you need to, place the plants now before you start making your punctures to insert
[45:07.200 --> 45:08.200]  your emitters.
[45:08.200 --> 45:10.540]  It may be a wise move to have the plants in place.
[45:10.540 --> 45:14.520]  If you've done this before, if you know how many plants fit and how much space, then you
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.160]  can probably do the math on that.
[45:16.160 --> 45:18.120]  But I would set the plants in place.
[45:18.120 --> 45:23.400]  If you've got a table, I know that this section, I think it's a six by, no it's got to be eight
[45:23.400 --> 45:24.400]  by six section.
[45:24.400 --> 45:27.760]  I think I can fit 15 to 18 plants in there depending on the strain.
[45:28.440 --> 45:30.680]  So I would think about, I need to get 15 emitters in here.
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.320]  Where am I going to put these plants?
[45:32.320 --> 45:34.880]  I would put three rows of five, right?
[45:34.880 --> 45:36.480]  So I'm going to need 15 emitters.
[45:36.480 --> 45:44.910]  I do seven coming off of this side.
[45:44.910 --> 45:48.750]  So before you go puncturing, think about how many plants on each side and think about how
[45:48.750 --> 45:50.790]  far apart they're going to be.
[45:50.790 --> 45:54.410]  If you do make punctures, you decide you don't need, they do sell little caps that just pop
[45:54.410 --> 45:58.230]  right into those holes, or you can just run spaghetti line off of it and then crimp it
[45:58.230 --> 45:59.750]  and put a hose clamp around it.
[45:59.750 --> 46:03.750]  It'll be just fine, but it's easier to not punch extra holes.
[46:03.750 --> 46:06.790]  So the emitters are going to be coming off of quarter inch tubing.
[46:06.790 --> 46:08.030]  They're little sprinklers.
[46:08.030 --> 46:09.550]  Those come off of quarter inch tubing.
[46:09.550 --> 46:14.390]  That quarter inch tubing is attached to our main line, that line you've got running down
[46:14.390 --> 46:16.710]  the table, that poly line.
[46:16.710 --> 47:01.610]  The emitters come out of there and the stake you need to insert it into the plant, all
[47:01.610 --> 47:14.130]  pre-assembled pretty close to the same length.
[47:14.130 --> 47:17.170]  That way you can keep all the water pressure the same everywhere.
[47:17.170 --> 47:20.530]  You don't get any weird over or under watering because you've got some lines that are too
[47:20.530 --> 47:21.530]  long.
[47:21.530 --> 47:22.730]  All right, I got way sidetracked.
[47:22.730 --> 47:24.130]  Let's try to get back to where I was.
[47:24.130 --> 47:26.210]  We've got the poly tubing.
[47:26.210 --> 47:29.930]  We're going to puncture a little hole in that poly tubing with the tool that they sell.
[47:29.930 --> 47:30.930]  It's really easy.
[47:30.930 --> 47:33.810]  You just smack the little, you can set it right on the tubing and then hit it with your
[47:33.810 --> 47:37.610]  other hand if you want to, to make it go through or just push it right on through.
[47:37.610 --> 47:40.150]  It takes a little bit of strength, but you should be able to get it.
[47:40.590 --> 47:44.390]  You puncture the tubing, then you basically insert the barb.
[47:44.390 --> 47:45.390]  It takes a little pressure.
[47:45.390 --> 47:46.390]  It might hurt your thumbs.
[47:46.390 --> 47:47.390]  They do sell a tool.
[47:47.390 --> 47:48.390]  You can use pliers.
[47:48.390 --> 47:50.590]  Get that little barb in there.
[47:50.590 --> 47:53.950]  Determine how long you need your tubing and cut it to length.
[47:53.950 --> 47:56.950]  Try to cut them all similarly, like I said, or by pre-cut.
[47:56.950 --> 47:58.950]  That's always more convenient.
[47:58.950 --> 48:02.570]  Then insert your chosen emitter onto the end of that tubing.
[48:02.570 --> 48:06.910]  That emitter, like I said a minute ago, is going to need a stake or some sort of platform
[48:06.990 --> 48:11.870]  to be inserted into your soil or cocoa or medium of choice to keep it in place.
[48:11.870 --> 48:15.190]  It's not just going to stay there by itself, a sprinkler head on a tube.
[48:15.190 --> 48:18.470]  It needs some sort of a support or some sort of placer.
[48:18.470 --> 48:22.830]  All this stuff is in the irrigation section at whichever hardware store you choose.
[48:22.830 --> 48:26.870]  But let's talk about the emitters to get because there are a ton of confusing options
[48:26.870 --> 48:31.430]  and I'll tell you exactly what I buy and then this may help you out.
[48:31.430 --> 48:41.710]  I like the MaxiJet MaxCone Fan 360s and those are available at www.maxijet.com.
[48:41.710 --> 48:46.090]  The actual part number that I order, because there are a lot to choose from and the descriptions
[48:46.090 --> 48:49.350]  are kind of vague if you don't know what you're looking for, the actual part number
[48:49.350 --> 48:57.990]  that I order from maxijet.com is M-A-B-3-6-D-1.
[48:57.990 --> 49:02.510]  So I guess Major, Alpha, Bravo, 36, Delta, 1.
[49:02.510 --> 49:06.230]  Just to make that super clear because I do speak with a weird tone sometimes.
[49:06.230 --> 49:07.870]  But that's the part number you need.
[49:07.870 --> 49:11.470]  There is a riser recommended on the same page that matches that emitter.
[49:11.470 --> 49:12.910]  I would recommend that.
[49:12.910 --> 49:17.030]  That's what you need to insert your emitter into the soil.
[49:17.030 --> 49:22.750]  There are similar emitters on Amazon, but they are blue and they are 12 emitters for
[49:22.750 --> 49:23.750]  $19.95.
[49:24.230 --> 49:28.030]  I think those are the same thing, but the description doesn't give me as many details
[49:28.030 --> 49:30.550]  as the others I recommended from MaxiJet.
[49:30.550 --> 49:33.950]  So maybe that'll help you out if you don't want to buy as many as they sell on MaxiJet.
[49:33.950 --> 49:36.270]  I think you have to buy 50 or 100 from there.
[49:36.270 --> 49:38.170]  Amazon you can get 12 of them.
[49:38.170 --> 49:39.950]  That should work for you.
[49:39.950 --> 49:43.950]  The MaxiJet are the emitters I recommend, but there are tons of other options that may
[49:43.950 --> 49:45.590]  work better for you.
[49:45.590 --> 49:49.950]  They do sell kits that you can buy to irrigate your garden.
[49:49.950 --> 49:53.510]  The little kits that they sell to irrigate your outdoor flower garden, those will work
[49:53.550 --> 49:54.830]  in your pot garden at home.
[49:54.830 --> 49:58.270]  If you have a small garden and you want to experiment with something like this, you don't
[49:58.270 --> 49:59.390]  have to build everything.
[49:59.390 --> 50:01.070]  This is kind of a fun way to do it.
[50:01.070 --> 50:02.790]  This is what we would do in a commercial facility.
[50:02.790 --> 50:06.950]  Those little kits they sell, that wouldn't work for me in a long 45 foot table.
[50:06.950 --> 50:08.910]  That may work for you in your small home grow.
[50:08.910 --> 50:10.990]  Look at those before you go building all of this.
[50:10.990 --> 50:13.790]  They're going to be right next to all of the stuff that I'm telling you to buy anyway.
[50:13.790 --> 50:15.390]  So you'll be in that department.
[50:15.390 --> 50:18.070]  Anyway, let's get back to where I was.
[50:18.070 --> 50:19.070]  Emitters.
[50:19.070 --> 50:20.070]  There are several emitter options.
[50:20.070 --> 50:21.070]  I told you what I like.
[50:21.070 --> 50:22.070]  I told you what I buy.
[50:22.070 --> 50:23.150]  I told you what I use.
[50:23.790 --> 50:25.070]  Like I said earlier, this is all customizable.
[50:25.070 --> 50:29.250]  If you like something different, I encourage you to use what you like.
[50:29.250 --> 50:31.650]  Maybe you want to experiment with emitters.
[50:31.650 --> 50:36.190]  Maybe once you get your whole system set up, before you start puncturing a bunch of holes,
[50:36.190 --> 50:41.610]  maybe you just puncture one hole and you have one grommet or one nipple with one line coming
[50:41.610 --> 50:44.750]  off of it where you just try a whole bunch of different emitter styles.
[50:44.750 --> 50:47.550]  You can just put one on, turn on the water and see what it's like.
[50:47.550 --> 50:48.550]  See if you like it or not.
[50:48.550 --> 50:50.230]  Turn the water off, pop another one on.
[50:50.230 --> 50:51.270]  Let's just start comparing.
[50:51.270 --> 50:52.270]  See which one you like the best.
[50:52.390 --> 50:56.750]  When you're doing that, keep in mind that when you add multiple emitters and multiple
[50:56.750 --> 51:00.230]  punctures, you're going to lose water pressure because you've got pressure coming out of
[51:00.230 --> 51:01.230]  more spots.
[51:01.230 --> 51:06.390]  But you should get a general idea of what the emitters are going to do.
[51:06.390 --> 51:09.750]  Figure out what kind you're going to use before you start puncturing a bunch of holes in your
[51:09.750 --> 51:11.630]  polytubing.
[51:11.630 --> 51:14.910]  Once you've found and selected the appropriate emitters that you like and that you're comfortable
[51:14.910 --> 51:19.670]  with and confident in, find the appropriate risers or stakes, insert those emitters into
[51:19.670 --> 51:20.750]  your plants.
[51:20.750 --> 51:25.710]  I insert one emitter per plant when I'm using a three gallon pot and I usually need to water
[51:25.710 --> 51:30.590]  once or twice a day and I grow pretty large plants in a commercial facility under double
[51:30.590 --> 51:31.670]  ended gavita lights.
[51:31.670 --> 51:32.990]  So that's a lot of light.
[51:32.990 --> 51:34.670]  There's a lot of action.
[51:34.670 --> 51:37.230]  One emitter is usually enough for me.
[51:37.230 --> 51:39.070]  Now let's talk about placing the emitter.
[51:39.070 --> 51:40.870]  We want to water the entire pot.
[51:40.870 --> 51:43.450]  We don't just want to water the left side or the right side.
[51:43.450 --> 51:47.230]  So try to stick that emitter as close to the center of the plant as you can get.
[51:47.230 --> 51:48.590]  Try to get it right next to the stalk.
[51:48.590 --> 51:49.810]  I know that may be hard.
[51:49.810 --> 51:50.930]  You don't want to puncture the roots.
[51:50.930 --> 51:54.130]  You don't want to tear up the roots a whole lot, but you want to get that stake right
[51:54.130 --> 51:55.770]  in there close to the center of the plant.
[51:55.770 --> 51:59.510]  So when you turn on the sprinklers, it waters that whole pot as much as you can.
[51:59.510 --> 52:01.010]  Think about that when you're placing them.
[52:01.010 --> 52:04.450]  If you've got a crew, if you've got a staff out there placing sprinklers, try to train
[52:04.450 --> 52:07.530]  them on placing them near the center.
[52:07.530 --> 52:08.530]  That's important.
[52:08.530 --> 52:09.530]  All right.
[52:09.530 --> 52:12.810]  I feel like we've covered most of building a drip system or an auto watering system.
[52:12.810 --> 52:17.330]  We've gotten all the way to placing the sprinklers right near the stalk of the plants.
[52:17.330 --> 52:20.650]  Let's recap a little bit and then we will dial this system in.
[52:20.650 --> 52:24.810]  Before you start, like I said, measure everything multiple times before you cut anything.
[52:24.810 --> 52:27.330]  If you've got tables, make sure you cut your tubing to the right length.
[52:27.330 --> 52:31.310]  If you're growing along the floor, make sure you cut your tubing to the right length.
[52:31.310 --> 52:34.930]  Measure twice, cut once, then you'll have to buy the supplies one time.
[52:34.930 --> 52:37.530]  How many times have you cut something too short and had to go back to the store and
[52:37.530 --> 52:38.530]  buy new shit?
[52:38.530 --> 52:40.090]  Don't do that to yourself.
[52:40.090 --> 52:42.170]  Maybe draw yourself a good plan before you get started.
[52:42.170 --> 52:45.850]  If you've got a helper, go over the plan with them so you both know the goal.
[52:45.850 --> 52:48.410]  Once you're confident, measure, cut, and assemble your system.
[52:48.410 --> 52:50.210]  Make sure you glue everything.
[52:50.210 --> 52:53.930]  If you're confident everything is primed and glued and all your hose clamps are secure
[52:53.930 --> 52:59.730]  and that you've got all your emitters in place properly, then it is time to test your system.
[52:59.730 --> 53:02.610]  Fill up your reservoir.
[53:02.610 --> 53:07.610]  Plug in your pump and then go run down to the grow room and see if the water is coming
[53:07.610 --> 53:08.610]  out of the emitters.
[53:08.610 --> 53:11.130]  Check for leaks all along the way.
[53:11.130 --> 53:13.370]  Start at the pump, work your way all the way down.
[53:13.370 --> 53:15.210]  See if anything is leaking.
[53:15.210 --> 53:16.850]  Look for water on the floor.
[53:16.850 --> 53:17.850]  Look for spraying.
[53:17.850 --> 53:18.850]  Listen.
[53:18.850 --> 53:20.010]  You'll know if it's leaking.
[53:20.010 --> 53:21.010]  Pay attention.
[53:21.010 --> 53:22.650]  Then go pay attention to every emitter.
[53:22.650 --> 53:25.390]  Make sure the water is coming out of every emitter.
[53:25.390 --> 53:29.030]  Now is the time to identify and correct your problems.
[53:29.030 --> 53:31.730]  If you haven't already put the plants in the room to judge your spacing, now is the time
[53:31.730 --> 53:35.850]  to put the plants in the room and start sticking those emitters in the plants.
[53:35.850 --> 53:39.450]  And now you have basically completed setting up an auto water system.
[53:39.450 --> 53:41.930]  Let's talk about a couple of different things now.
[53:41.930 --> 53:46.170]  Do you want this system to water at a certain time in the morning without you there?
[53:46.170 --> 53:49.970]  You can have this just when the lights come on, you can make this water.
[53:49.970 --> 53:52.150]  Or do you want to be there when this happens?
[53:52.150 --> 53:55.690]  To make this happen when you're not there is really easy.
[53:55.690 --> 53:58.270]  Mix up your reservoir with the desired nutrients.
[53:58.270 --> 54:01.190]  Have your pH and your PPM set how you want them.
[54:01.190 --> 54:04.250]  Have a mix pump in there so that shit keeps stirring through the night so nothing gets
[54:04.250 --> 54:08.370]  settled so that it just stays, stays cycled up all the time.
[54:08.370 --> 54:10.730]  Then have a timer on your pump.
[54:10.730 --> 54:15.490]  Your light comes on at nine, at nine o'clock, have that pump trigger too.
[54:15.490 --> 54:19.170]  And now it'll just run that water and it'll water your plants for you while you're at
[54:19.170 --> 54:22.130]  work, while you're on vacation, while you're sleeping right through it.
[54:22.130 --> 54:26.650]  Now the thing you're going to have to do is dial in how long you run that pump.
[54:26.650 --> 54:30.130]  Because if you just turn it on and let it run, it will run until it's out of water.
[54:30.130 --> 54:34.130]  If you've got 20 gallons in there and it only takes 10 gallons to water your room, you're
[54:34.130 --> 54:35.130]  going to overflow.
[54:35.130 --> 54:37.410]  So here's what you got to do.
[54:37.410 --> 54:41.070]  Start keeping a timer every time you water your plants.
[54:41.070 --> 55:38.150]  Get those emitters in there, set a little timer, hit go on the pump.
[55:38.150 --> 55:41.110]  Now sometimes your emitters are going to get clogged.
[55:41.110 --> 55:43.330]  We do have that filter down at the end.
[55:43.330 --> 55:46.170]  Sometimes little shit passes through there and it builds up in that emitter.
[55:46.170 --> 55:47.370]  That's not a big deal.
[55:47.370 --> 55:51.250]  Simply turn off the water, take off that emitter, get something little tiny and just poke it
[55:51.250 --> 55:52.250]  out.
[55:52.250 --> 55:55.170]  You can just put a little pokey in there, just something like a wire brush bristle.
[55:55.170 --> 55:56.650]  Just poke it out.
[55:56.650 --> 56:00.730]  Sometimes I buy them in bulk so I just have another emitter ready to go.
[56:00.730 --> 56:02.530]  I pop one out, pop a fresh one in.
[56:02.530 --> 56:04.370]  I put those dirty ones in a pile.
[56:04.370 --> 56:07.210]  When somebody doesn't have something to do, that's when they go along and just clean all
[56:07.210 --> 56:08.210]  that kind of stuff.
[56:08.210 --> 56:10.930]  Maybe just throw that in a bucket with some Fizan and some water.
[56:10.930 --> 56:13.430]  Let it kind of clean up for you while you're not even there.
[56:13.430 --> 56:14.850]  Go back and give them a rinse and they're clean.
[56:14.850 --> 56:17.450]  You can use those as your replacement emitters next time.
[56:17.450 --> 56:18.970]  So those are going to have to be replaced.
[56:18.970 --> 56:23.250]  Pay attention every day to clogged emitters because your plant will not get watered if
[56:23.250 --> 56:24.930]  that emitter is clogged.
[56:24.930 --> 56:30.900]  Also, pay attention to a clogged emitter.
[56:30.900 --> 56:34.620]  Overall, your plants should really love an automated watering system.
[56:34.620 --> 56:35.860]  It's going to be more consistent.
[56:35.860 --> 56:37.100]  It's going to be more even.
[56:37.100 --> 56:39.140]  The plants are going to get the right amount of water.
[56:39.140 --> 56:42.020]  You should like it because you're going to save time, you're going to save energy, you're
[56:42.020 --> 56:43.180]  going to save water.
[56:43.180 --> 56:44.980]  You'll probably save nutrients.
[56:44.980 --> 56:47.420]  You'll see an increase in production in your plants.
[56:47.420 --> 56:49.740]  You'll see an increase in performance in your plants.
[56:49.740 --> 56:53.500]  You'll have time to do some of those details I tell you about that you say, when am I going
[56:53.500 --> 56:54.500]  to ever do that?
[56:54.900 --> 58:01.500]  You're going to do that right after you get this drip system dialed in.
[58:01.500 --> 58:03.620]  You can set up as many of those in a row as you want.
[58:03.620 --> 58:06.060]  You can set them up as many wide as you want.
[58:06.060 --> 58:10.140]  Just a basic four by eight botanic care flood tray on cinder blocks.
[58:10.140 --> 58:12.860]  The cinder blocks are a little bit taller than a five gallon bucket.
[58:12.860 --> 58:15.980]  You could slide the bucket under there to catch the runoff and then you can just run
[58:15.980 --> 58:19.920]  your poly tubing right down these four by eight tables like I was talking about earlier.
[58:19.920 --> 58:23.380]  You guys, you can make these as ghetto or as fancy as you'd like and they're still going
[58:23.380 --> 58:24.380]  to do the same thing.
[58:24.620 --> 58:26.900]  If it works for you, that's what matters.
[58:26.900 --> 58:31.500]  You can build a trellis system around it by putting PVC pipes in a five gallon bucket.
[58:31.500 --> 58:33.580]  Fill that five gallon bucket up with cement.
[58:33.580 --> 58:36.300]  Just go get some quick create from Lowe's or Home Depot.
[58:36.300 --> 58:39.180]  Pour it right into the bucket and just let it harden right in the bucket there with a
[58:39.180 --> 58:42.660]  pole, a PVC pole, six or eight feet tall sticking right out of it.
[58:42.660 --> 58:44.260]  And now you've got a steady pole.
[58:44.260 --> 58:47.460]  Put those in each corner and then just run your trellising on there.
[58:47.460 --> 58:51.220]  And that's a really affordable way to make yourself a greenhouse style flood table with
[58:51.220 --> 58:52.580]  an auto watering system.
[58:52.580 --> 58:56.740]  And then you can go ahead and throw trellising bars up on there and it's really affordable
[58:56.740 --> 58:57.820]  and it'll work for you.
[58:57.820 --> 58:59.420]  It doesn't have to look super fancy.
[58:59.420 --> 59:00.740]  It will get the job done.
[59:00.740 --> 59:05.220]  All right, you guys, don't be afraid to adjust, adapt and customize any of the things that
[59:05.220 --> 59:06.720]  I said in this episode.
[59:06.720 --> 59:08.500]  You might need longer or shorter tubing.
[59:08.500 --> 59:10.800]  You may need thicker or skinnier tubing.
[59:10.800 --> 59:12.500]  You may need more emitters.
[59:12.500 --> 59:14.380]  You may like different sprinklers than me.
[59:14.380 --> 59:16.360]  This is just a good idea of how to get it started.
[59:16.360 --> 59:18.420]  Do what works for you.
[59:18.420 --> 59:20.260]  Experiment and have fun.
[59:20.260 --> 59:23.620]  This does sound a lot like a lot of work and it does sound kind of intimidating, but
[59:23.620 --> 59:27.060]  I promise that once you go to the hardware store and you get started and you get that
[59:27.060 --> 59:31.120]  pump in your hand and you're like, I've got the start, then it's all going to come together
[59:31.120 --> 59:35.020]  so easily and it will be a fun project for you and a friend, I hope.
[59:35.020 --> 59:38.100]  So don't let a little work scare you away from automation.
[59:38.100 --> 59:41.420]  It's really not that hard and it will pay off huge in the long run.
[59:41.420 --> 59:44.420]  All right, you guys, I've got a lot more stuff written down, but this episode is going to
[59:44.420 --> 59:47.420]  be an hour long, so I'm going to wrap it up.
