[00:00.060 --> 00:18.730]  All right, here we go.
[00:18.730 --> 00:20.570]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.570 --> 00:21.570]  I'm your host.
[00:21.570 --> 00:29.270]  My friends call me Ross DeJeff, and this is episode 697 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:29.270 --> 00:32.710]  In this episode, I get to talk about one of my favorite strains.
[00:32.710 --> 00:36.410]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of those great
[00:36.410 --> 00:41.190]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:41.190 --> 00:45.110]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out to my friend
[00:45.110 --> 00:46.670]  of the Chicago Dabber.
[00:46.670 --> 00:49.950]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to DontTreadOnMe420.
[00:49.950 --> 00:52.910]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Lefty's Farms.
[00:52.910 --> 00:56.770]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to my buddy Fiscal's Organics and Uncle Adam.
[00:56.770 --> 00:59.630]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to Chacoba and Grow Bandit.
[00:59.630 --> 01:03.230]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to the hardest working man in cannabis, my buddy
[01:03.230 --> 01:04.590]  James Brown.
[01:04.590 --> 01:07.570]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Magic Mike.
[01:07.570 --> 01:09.530]  Big thanks to G7.
[01:09.530 --> 01:12.290]  Special thank you to GreenVet88224.
[01:12.290 --> 01:16.290]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out
[01:16.290 --> 01:18.570]  to my friend Spartan420.
[01:18.570 --> 01:23.570]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:23.570 --> 01:27.170]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:27.170 --> 01:33.650]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:33.650 --> 01:36.330]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:36.330 --> 01:40.610]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:40.610 --> 01:43.770]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:43.770 --> 01:48.210]  Recently it was brought to my attention that I was failing to include those notes properly
[01:48.210 --> 01:49.690]  on Spotify.
[01:49.690 --> 01:52.890]  From episode 696 on, that should be corrected.
[01:52.890 --> 01:54.970]  I've put the notes in the correct place.
[01:54.970 --> 02:01.530]  So in episode 696, 97 and every episode after that, you should be able to find the Patreon
[02:01.530 --> 02:05.690]  link, the Discord link and all of the other great information that should have been in
[02:05.730 --> 02:06.730]  those show notes.
[02:06.730 --> 02:11.010]  I did some updates and upgrades to my website and when that changed, how I posted the show
[02:11.010 --> 02:15.130]  did change and I was simply putting the notes in the wrong place.
[02:15.130 --> 02:16.130]  I have learned my lesson.
[02:16.130 --> 02:17.130]  That has been corrected.
[02:17.130 --> 02:18.130]  I apologize.
[02:18.130 --> 02:20.930]  Thank you for watching and listening and learning with us.
[02:20.930 --> 02:21.930]  Check out the show notes.
[02:21.930 --> 02:24.130]  There's a lot of cool links in there you may have been looking for.
[02:24.130 --> 02:25.130]  All right.
[02:25.130 --> 02:27.490]  I did say I was going to talk about my favorite strain.
[02:27.490 --> 02:28.690]  I am a seed breeder.
[02:28.690 --> 02:30.170]  I do own a seed company.
[02:30.170 --> 02:35.170]  I have had the honor, the privilege, the pleasure, the headache also of working with a lot of
[02:35.650 --> 02:36.650]  strains.
[02:36.650 --> 02:39.810]  I do need to remind myself that sometimes not all strains were champions.
[02:39.810 --> 02:43.330]  There's a lot of bullshit that went through our hands over the learning period of growing
[02:43.330 --> 02:45.370]  cannabis here.
[02:45.370 --> 02:47.970]  I got the honor and pleasure to work with a lot of great strains.
[02:47.970 --> 02:54.970]  I get to, I worked in commercial grow facilities where we had sometimes up to 75, maybe 100
[02:54.970 --> 02:58.690]  different cultivars, mother plants on premises at one time.
[02:58.690 --> 03:04.050]  So I had 100 different plants to learn, to learn how they grow, learn how they smell,
[03:04.050 --> 03:08.370]  learn how they respond to nutrients, learn how they react to cold, heat, lollipopping,
[03:08.370 --> 03:12.810]  topping, bottoming, twisting, popping, random stresses that would be put on them through
[03:12.810 --> 03:17.090]  the commercial cultivation facility and environment and process.
[03:17.090 --> 03:20.090]  I got the pleasure to grow a lot of plants.
[03:20.090 --> 03:23.010]  I said a moment ago that I realized some of those also were a headache.
[03:23.010 --> 03:24.690]  Some of those were not a pleasure.
[03:24.690 --> 03:27.250]  The weird thing is that some of the plants that were the worst headache put out some
[03:27.250 --> 03:28.610]  of the best fucking products.
[03:28.610 --> 03:30.570]  So that was always a good gamble.
[03:30.570 --> 03:33.650]  I am, I digress is what my grandma used to say.
[03:33.650 --> 03:36.770]  I got the honor to grow a lot of different things.
[03:36.770 --> 03:39.850]  People often ask me, what is your favorite strain that you've bred?
[03:39.850 --> 03:41.610]  People always ask me, what's your favorite strain?
[03:41.610 --> 03:43.290]  That is a really hard choice.
[03:43.290 --> 03:44.970]  That's like asking me my favorite child.
[03:44.970 --> 03:45.970]  It's Maya.
[03:45.970 --> 03:46.970]  It will always be Maya.
[03:46.970 --> 03:47.970]  Shout out to Maya.
[03:47.970 --> 03:48.970]  She knows she's my favorite.
[03:48.970 --> 03:52.410]  But asking my favorite strain is really hard because sometimes I like to smoke something
[03:52.410 --> 03:54.730]  different during the day than I would in the evening.
[03:54.730 --> 03:57.530]  Sometimes that midday smoke has got to be different.
[03:57.530 --> 04:01.730]  In the nighttime, in the evening, when I'm done, when it's time to chill out, scroll
[04:01.730 --> 04:04.690]  the internet, do whatever you do, sitting in the chair, playing with your phone, just
[04:04.690 --> 04:08.610]  relaxing, sitting at the table, smoking dabs, recording a podcast.
[04:08.610 --> 04:11.170]  That's when I want to hit some dabs that are going to obliterate me.
[04:11.170 --> 04:15.450]  Some garlic scented, some pungent, cushy kind of shit that's just going to put me on my
[04:15.450 --> 04:17.290]  ass.
[04:17.290 --> 04:22.090]  Early in the day, I need something that is going to get me high, but make my brain work
[04:22.090 --> 04:25.730]  and function and make me want to be around people and not make me want to go sit down
[04:25.730 --> 04:29.850]  and be lazy and lethargic and let my brain drift off into Neverland.
[04:29.850 --> 04:33.730]  I need to stay focused and going, but I like to be buzzed and high and have just a little
[04:33.730 --> 04:37.970]  bit of an edge to where I just put a smile on my face for no stupid reason.
[04:37.970 --> 04:40.410]  That's when I would smoke something like the Orangegasm or something.
[04:40.410 --> 04:44.130]  That gets me the proper kind of high for the day or Lemon Jeffery.
[04:44.130 --> 04:47.930]  Lemon Jeffery and Orangegasm are beautiful early day, midday kind of smokes, but later
[04:47.930 --> 04:52.410]  in the day, I want Double Dose, Dark Hollow, The Machine, something like that to kind of
[04:52.410 --> 04:53.970]  just wreck me a little bit differently.
[04:53.970 --> 04:58.050]  So picking my favorite strain is quite a challenge.
[04:58.050 --> 05:04.730]  Also as the breeder, the grower, the creator, I don't only consider the smoking aspect of
[05:04.730 --> 05:05.730]  a favorite strain.
[05:05.730 --> 05:07.530]  I also think about the experience in the garden.
[05:07.530 --> 05:08.530]  I get to grow it.
[05:08.530 --> 05:11.250]  I get to know how does it clone.
[05:11.250 --> 05:12.250]  Does it clone well?
[05:12.250 --> 05:15.090]  If a plant doesn't clone well, that can be a headache from the very beginning.
[05:15.090 --> 05:16.830]  You got to get those healthy clones.
[05:16.830 --> 05:17.830]  Does it veg well?
[05:17.830 --> 05:18.830]  Does it transplant well?
[05:18.830 --> 05:19.830]  Does it deal with light well?
[05:19.830 --> 05:21.570]  Does it deal with changes well?
[05:21.570 --> 05:25.610]  Does it go from the clone area to the bedroom, to the bigger bedroom, to the flower room?
[05:25.610 --> 05:27.850]  Does it take all those transitions well?
[05:28.650 --> 05:31.450]  How does the plant handle, like I said a moment ago, all of the stresses and experiments and
[05:31.450 --> 05:36.050]  random bullshit that we are going to throw at it in either a commercial facility, my
[05:36.050 --> 05:38.950]  personal growth, or perhaps even my breeding environment.
[05:38.950 --> 05:43.130]  Those plants get put through a whole nother rigorous round of testing.
[05:43.130 --> 05:44.650]  That casting couch is even worse.
[05:44.650 --> 05:49.370]  That's like a fucking Ninja Warrior getting through that one to be in the breeding room.
[05:49.370 --> 05:51.130]  That's a whole nother level of testing.
[05:51.130 --> 05:55.010]  Anyway, I'm just building you up to talk about some of my favorite strains.
[05:55.010 --> 05:57.690]  Of course, on the list would be Arise.
[05:57.690 --> 06:03.410]  Arise is on the top of the list because the super potency, hyper vigor, the way it grows.
[06:03.410 --> 06:07.370]  If you need an indica, if you need a sativa, it's right in the middle.
[06:07.370 --> 06:09.410]  Whenever you smoke that, you're going to get the buzz you need.
[06:09.410 --> 06:12.410]  You can find a phenotype that will do exactly what you need.
[06:12.410 --> 06:16.650]  I read some reports on it that people can't smoke it during the day because it puts them
[06:16.650 --> 06:17.650]  down too much.
[06:17.650 --> 06:22.230]  Then some people can't smoke it at night because it keeps them up too much.
[06:22.230 --> 06:23.550]  People are getting wrecked off of that weed.
[06:23.550 --> 06:24.550]  That's really tremendous to me.
[06:25.090 --> 06:26.090]  I like the Arise.
[06:26.090 --> 06:27.890]  Also, I'm a huge fan of the Lemon Jeffrey.
[06:27.890 --> 06:29.690]  Of course, it's got my name in it.
[06:29.690 --> 06:32.450]  Lemon Jeffrey is named after me, that lemon terp.
[06:32.450 --> 06:35.390]  I don't know if you've been around for a long time, if this is your first time watching
[06:35.390 --> 06:36.910]  or if you've watched a lot of episodes.
[06:36.910 --> 06:38.030]  Here's a reminder.
[06:38.030 --> 06:42.410]  In April of 2015, I hit my head and got a traumatic brain injury.
[06:42.410 --> 06:43.410]  I thought I was going to die.
[06:43.410 --> 06:45.690]  I kind of wanted to die because of that brain injury.
[06:45.690 --> 06:51.330]  I don't have that desire or feeling anymore, but I had some weird lingering effects from
[06:51.330 --> 06:52.770]  the brain injury.
[06:52.770 --> 06:54.410]  My body wouldn't regulate its temperature.
[06:55.270 --> 06:56.270]  I would get nervous.
[06:56.270 --> 06:57.270]  I would have glitches.
[06:57.270 --> 06:58.270]  I felt like I was just skipping.
[06:58.270 --> 06:59.270]  My brain was just skipping.
[06:59.270 --> 07:01.550]  I'd find myself in the kitchen and not know why I was in the kitchen.
[07:01.550 --> 07:05.810]  I'd be standing in the middle of the office and not remember why I came in the office.
[07:05.810 --> 07:06.810]  Weird shit would happen.
[07:06.810 --> 07:10.270]  I would smoke Lemon Jeffrey and all those weird glitches and all the weird skips would
[07:10.270 --> 07:11.270]  just go away.
[07:11.270 --> 07:12.270]  It would all come together.
[07:12.270 --> 07:15.830]  The puzzle pieces of my brain would just lock back together.
[07:15.830 --> 07:18.950]  Arise, Lemon Jeffrey, those are some of my favorites.
[07:18.950 --> 07:20.230]  Of course, the Orange Gasm.
[07:20.230 --> 07:23.590]  The Orange Gasm is a great daytime smoke, amazing buzz.
[07:23.770 --> 07:28.210]  I'm super proud of that because before I made that, I was sitting at a table with somebody
[07:28.210 --> 07:31.170]  and I said, I'm going to cross the Golden Goat.
[07:31.170 --> 07:34.010]  I'm going to pollinate the Platinum Tangy with the Golden Goat.
[07:34.010 --> 07:35.690]  I'm going to call it Orange Gasm.
[07:35.690 --> 07:36.970]  It's going to smell like this.
[07:36.970 --> 07:38.490]  This is the buzz we will get.
[07:38.490 --> 07:40.770]  These are the common phenotypes we will find.
[07:40.770 --> 07:41.810]  I'm going to call it this.
[07:41.810 --> 07:43.610]  I think it's going to be a fucking hit.
[07:43.610 --> 07:46.170]  I did that before I put that strain out.
[07:46.170 --> 07:49.490]  The person that I talked that conversation to is watching.
[07:49.490 --> 07:50.490]  Big up.
[07:50.490 --> 07:51.490]  I hope you're well.
[07:51.490 --> 07:52.490]  Shout out.
[07:52.590 --> 07:54.710]  When I made those seeds, we grew those seeds.
[07:54.710 --> 07:59.030]  We found exactly what I had anticipated, exactly what I predicted.
[07:59.030 --> 08:00.550]  So I was super proud of that.
[08:00.550 --> 08:02.710]  Then it was a market hit.
[08:02.710 --> 08:07.910]  Being a breeder, I put out a lot of products and I don't know what the public, the market,
[08:07.910 --> 08:11.270]  the community, the clientele, I don't know what they're going to love.
[08:11.270 --> 08:12.310]  I don't know what's going to pop.
[08:12.310 --> 08:15.130]  I don't know what's going to get overlooked and what's going to be a huge hit.
[08:15.130 --> 08:17.030]  The Orange Gasm, fucking hit.
[08:17.030 --> 08:19.590]  So I'm super proud of that one for a lot of different reasons.
[08:19.590 --> 08:21.270]  Lemon Jeffrey in the same aspect.
[08:21.290 --> 08:25.890]  I did not know that Lemon Jeff was going to be a banger and it is popular.
[08:25.890 --> 08:30.330]  The Orange Gasm, the Lemon Jeffrey are two of my most sought after in-demand strains
[08:30.330 --> 08:33.810]  and for you people that keep asking, that sounds rude when you say you people, for you
[08:33.810 --> 08:38.410]  kind amazing folks who keep asking and have enthusiasm and excitement about the Lemon
[08:38.410 --> 08:43.450]  Jeff, the Orange Gasm and the Feminized Golden Goat S1 seeds.
[08:43.450 --> 08:45.490]  If I said feminized, I shouldn't need to say S1.
[08:45.490 --> 08:46.690]  That was redundant.
[08:46.690 --> 08:47.690]  Call me out on that.
[08:47.870 --> 08:51.150]  If you're the people that are excited for those, have no fear.
[08:51.150 --> 08:52.150]  They are in veg.
[08:52.150 --> 08:54.910]  The plants are not very big at this time, but they are in veg.
[08:54.910 --> 08:55.910]  It will happen.
[08:55.910 --> 08:56.910]  They're coming.
[08:56.910 --> 08:57.910]  Be patient.
[08:57.910 --> 09:01.870]  Since I'm limited by plant counts and plant numbers, I'm going to veg them a little larger
[09:01.870 --> 09:04.870]  than normal because I can't put more plants in there like we used to do.
[09:04.870 --> 09:05.990]  You just shove more in.
[09:05.990 --> 09:07.390]  I got to make them bigger.
[09:07.390 --> 09:10.790]  So it's going to take a little bit longer veg time than we will pollinate, than we will
[09:10.790 --> 09:12.350]  have good seeds.
[09:12.350 --> 09:16.950]  Also there's another secret feminized project in the works that I haven't even talked about.
[09:17.810 --> 09:18.810]  There are Fem seeds coming.
[09:18.810 --> 09:19.810]  All right.
[09:19.810 --> 09:21.130]  So I cut myself off from rambling.
[09:21.130 --> 09:24.730]  The Lemon Jeffrey, the Orange Gasm, the Arise are some of my favorites.
[09:24.730 --> 09:28.410]  Let's talk about the one that this episode is going to focus on because I've been rambling
[09:28.410 --> 09:30.130]  for long enough I feel like.
[09:30.130 --> 09:34.970]  One of my favorites, one of the first strains that I made that really made me go, oh wow,
[09:34.970 --> 09:39.090]  made me proud, made other people say, hey, I really need some of that was a strain that
[09:39.090 --> 09:41.930]  I call the Grateful Dog.
[09:41.930 --> 09:44.050]  Let's talk about the Grateful Dog.
[09:44.050 --> 09:45.410]  There are a lot of things we could talk about.
[09:45.410 --> 09:47.790]  Why do I love the Grateful Dog?
[09:47.790 --> 09:51.950]  The first time I took the Grateful Dog to a party, I was at a party.
[09:51.950 --> 09:53.550]  We're just partying, doing our normal stuff.
[09:53.550 --> 09:55.670]  And then, you know, and someone's like, hey, anybody got any weed?
[09:55.670 --> 09:59.270]  And everybody looks at me because I'm the guy around here that back then, this was like
[09:59.270 --> 10:02.950]  before medical marijuana and recreational cannabis were super popular and everybody
[10:02.950 --> 10:05.810]  had weed all the time and it was abundant.
[10:05.810 --> 10:07.870]  People wanted to smoke and everybody just kind of did the thing.
[10:07.870 --> 10:08.870]  They all stared my direction.
[10:08.870 --> 10:10.870]  Hey, why can't I have dreadlocks?
[10:10.870 --> 10:11.870]  And I was okay with that.
[10:11.870 --> 10:13.710]  I knew I was known around here as being the weed guy.
[10:14.010 --> 10:17.290]  So I was like, fuck yeah, I got some new weed that I would love to try with people.
[10:17.290 --> 10:21.290]  So I bust out my jar and I take off the lid and everybody within like a three to six foot
[10:21.290 --> 10:25.290]  circumference goes, wow, man, what do you have?
[10:25.290 --> 10:28.450]  And then people nine and 10 feet away started going, what is that shit?
[10:28.450 --> 10:30.330]  And everybody gathered around.
[10:30.330 --> 10:32.490]  And I'm probably telling a fantastical story.
[10:32.490 --> 10:36.690]  This is probably a Bert Kreischer style hyperbole, but this is what it felt like.
[10:36.690 --> 10:40.730]  When I cracked open one of those nuggets to roll a joint, everybody in the party came
[10:40.730 --> 10:44.390]  outside, sat on the back porch and watched me roll that joint.
[10:44.390 --> 10:49.110]  And they were drooling like Pavlov's dogs, just waiting to smoke some of that weed.
[10:49.110 --> 10:52.030]  I don't know if everybody was doing that really, but that's how it felt.
[10:52.030 --> 10:53.630]  And that's how that weed made me feel.
[10:53.630 --> 10:54.890]  I was drooling.
[10:54.890 --> 10:56.910]  I was like, this weed smells so good.
[10:56.910 --> 11:00.630]  I'm used to smoking weed, like in my environment, when you smoke at your house and your car
[11:00.630 --> 11:04.830]  and your office, at your studio, wherever you normally smoke, you don't notice all the
[11:04.830 --> 11:06.510]  details, all the, I don't know.
[11:06.510 --> 11:07.510]  It may be different.
[11:07.510 --> 11:10.690]  And so I noticed earlier, I like to test into my office because I notice everything, but
[11:10.690 --> 11:11.690]  maybe I got too comfortable.
[11:11.690 --> 11:15.250]  Cause when I took it somewhere else, cracked it open and rolled the joint and smoked it,
[11:15.250 --> 11:19.450]  I noticed new turps, new flavors and a new buzz and everybody loved it.
[11:19.450 --> 11:22.010]  And that's when I was like, well, this weed is special.
[11:22.010 --> 11:24.690]  And luckily I had made seeds of that weed.
[11:24.690 --> 11:29.090]  So I had a bunch of seeds of it and I packaged up those seeds and I took those to the upcoming
[11:29.090 --> 11:32.970]  cannabis cup, the Denver High Times, the High Times Cannabis Cup in Denver.
[11:32.970 --> 11:37.890]  The first one that was, this was at the, the one after the Xdo, the one when they moved
[11:37.890 --> 11:42.910]  it to the, the Denver Mart, the bigger place there, took it there and passed out a bunch
[11:42.910 --> 11:43.910]  of seeds.
[11:43.910 --> 11:46.030]  And then the next year people were asking for seeds.
[11:46.030 --> 11:50.630]  That strain that I was giving out was what I was calling Grateful Dog.
[11:50.630 --> 11:52.390]  Where did the Grateful Dog come from?
[11:52.390 --> 11:55.430]  Or do we want to talk more about why I was in love with the Grateful Dog?
[11:55.430 --> 11:57.830]  Let's talk about why I fell in love with the Grateful Dog.
[11:57.830 --> 12:02.630]  There was something about the turps, the aroma, the flavor, the buzz that just made me go,
[12:03.290 --> 12:06.890]  it just, it smelled nasty and good at the same time.
[12:06.890 --> 12:11.130]  People hate it when I say it smells like dirty feet, but it smelled like dirty, funky feet
[12:11.130 --> 12:12.970]  and skunk and chemicals.
[12:12.970 --> 12:15.530]  But then it also had a sweet berry bottom to it.
[12:15.530 --> 12:18.770]  So it was dirty, dirty funk with this like, Ooh, what is that?
[12:18.770 --> 12:22.450]  At the end of it, it was just a question mark of, huh, did you put, did you put some skunk
[12:22.450 --> 12:23.850]  weed on a grape blunt wrap?
[12:23.850 --> 12:26.410]  It was just a weird after fruity taste.
[12:26.410 --> 12:31.930]  I also loved it because I've spoke about this earlier as the grower, it grew with nice vigor,
[12:31.950 --> 12:34.150]  nice structure, nice shape.
[12:34.150 --> 12:35.790]  The buds were great.
[12:35.790 --> 12:39.590]  Also it was very resistant to problems.
[12:39.590 --> 12:43.190]  Sometimes back then I was known to get a, that room that that plant was grown in was
[12:43.190 --> 12:47.290]  prone to get powdery mildew at one part of the year, about this part of the year, every
[12:47.290 --> 12:51.670]  year when the seasons would change, you have days that are like in the high seventies and
[12:51.670 --> 12:53.830]  then the nights are like the low fifties.
[12:53.830 --> 12:57.550]  That shit was giving us powdery mildew before I learned how to correct that room.
[12:57.550 --> 13:00.050]  The Grateful Dog wasn't getting the powdery mildew.
[13:00.050 --> 13:01.410]  So I was loving that.
[13:01.410 --> 13:05.670]  So it would turn purple, it would turn crazy colors, and then it would give us nice big
[13:05.670 --> 13:06.670]  fat harvest.
[13:06.670 --> 13:09.870]  So it was paying the weight and then it was a good breeder.
[13:09.870 --> 13:14.310]  As a breeder, everything I've bred it to has made pretty impressive plants.
[13:14.310 --> 13:17.030]  The morning dew comes from the Grateful Dog.
[13:17.030 --> 13:19.990]  There are some other fem things that come from the Grateful Dog.
[13:19.990 --> 13:21.870]  Shouldn't say too many things because a lot of those are sold out.
[13:21.870 --> 13:22.950]  The morning dew is available.
[13:22.950 --> 13:25.950]  The rest, not so much available.
[13:25.950 --> 13:29.230]  There may be some Jack the Ripper Grateful Dog crosses coming in the future.
[13:29.230 --> 13:30.830]  I should not have even said that.
[13:31.250 --> 13:32.570]  All right, let me get myself back on track.
[13:32.570 --> 13:33.850]  We've talked about why I loved it.
[13:33.850 --> 13:34.850]  What is it?
[13:34.850 --> 13:38.370]  What is this damn Grateful Dog plant that I keep alluding to?
[13:38.370 --> 13:42.290]  Grateful Dog is, so let me try to put that out there one more time because my brain was
[13:42.290 --> 13:44.250]  stumbling and my mouth was stuttering.
[13:44.250 --> 13:53.290]  It is Chem 91 cross 2, the San Fernando Valley Cush F4, the S-F-V-O-G F4.
[13:53.290 --> 13:56.210]  Now that also is known as Deadhead OG.
[13:56.210 --> 13:57.210]  That's right.
[13:57.210 --> 13:58.730]  I got the seed as a Deadhead OG.
[13:58.830 --> 14:02.470]  I grew out a pack of Deadhead OG seeds and I numbered them.
[14:02.470 --> 14:05.190]  My favorite one in the bunch was number nine.
[14:05.190 --> 14:08.150]  I don't know why that matters, but that is the one I selected.
[14:08.150 --> 14:11.030]  I took number nine and I reversed it.
[14:11.030 --> 14:13.230]  So I took two clones of number nine.
[14:13.230 --> 14:14.670]  I treated one with the solution.
[14:14.670 --> 14:16.870]  I've done a full episode on the reversal.
[14:16.870 --> 14:17.870]  Treated one with the solution.
[14:17.870 --> 14:21.170]  I pollinated the other clone of number nine.
[14:21.170 --> 14:22.710]  Seeds came out of this.
[14:22.710 --> 14:25.870]  Those seeds got labeled the Grateful Dog.
[14:25.870 --> 14:27.710]  So that is where the Grateful Dog came from.
[14:27.930 --> 14:30.370]  It is a reversed Deadhead OG.
[14:30.370 --> 14:32.410]  That is where it originated.
[14:32.410 --> 14:38.950]  So out of that batch of Deadhead OG S1s came a keeper that got labeled the Grateful Dog.
[14:38.950 --> 14:40.830]  That is one of my favorite plants ever.
[14:40.830 --> 14:43.770]  The seeds that were released from that were that plant's self.
[14:43.770 --> 14:45.730]  I would self the Grateful Dog plant.
[14:45.730 --> 14:49.570]  I would self that to itself and put out the seeds from that.
[14:49.570 --> 14:56.290]  Later on, I decided to take the pollen from the original Grateful Dog mom, the number
[14:56.350 --> 15:03.270]  nine, and I put that pollen on my favorite Grateful Dog keeper that I had made.
[15:03.270 --> 15:07.470]  And that one got labeled GD77.
[15:07.470 --> 15:09.670]  Now let's talk about these names.
[15:09.670 --> 15:13.070]  Grateful Dog is a Grateful Dead offshoot band.
[15:13.070 --> 15:15.270]  That is David Grissman and Jerry Garcia.
[15:15.270 --> 15:17.390]  They do some acoustic Grateful Dead stuff.
[15:17.390 --> 15:19.550]  They do some bluegrass style stuff.
[15:19.550 --> 15:23.550]  They do some creative eclectic type of shit.
[15:23.770 --> 15:26.370]  That was where Grateful Dog came from.
[15:26.370 --> 15:31.890]  Grateful Dog was a Grateful Dead offshoot, a Jerry Garcia side project with David Grissman.
[15:31.890 --> 15:36.770]  Since it came from Deadhead OG, it got called the Grateful Dog.
[15:36.770 --> 15:39.610]  So it was a Deadhead OG S1.
[15:39.610 --> 15:42.330]  I selected the plant out of that.
[15:42.330 --> 15:44.410]  That is the Grateful Dog.
[15:44.410 --> 15:49.850]  Now from the Grateful Dog, I took the pollen from the original Deadhead OG that I reversed,
[15:49.850 --> 15:52.170]  put that pollen on my Grateful Dog.
[15:52.190 --> 15:54.990]  We have now created GD77.
[15:54.990 --> 15:57.190]  Why GD77?
[15:57.190 --> 16:01.670]  Because 1977 is my favorite year of the Grateful Dead.
[16:01.670 --> 16:04.350]  The Grateful Dead was around for several, several years.
[16:04.350 --> 16:06.310]  77 is one of my favorite years.
[16:06.310 --> 16:07.390]  They got real psychedelic.
[16:07.390 --> 16:12.710]  They got trippy, put out some great albums, great songs around that time.
[16:12.710 --> 16:19.390]  The shows from the spring run of 77 that may run, the Betty Boards, if anybody, any Deadheads
[16:19.390 --> 16:20.790]  out there know what I'm talking about.
[16:20.790 --> 16:21.910]  That shit is awesome to me.
[16:21.930 --> 16:22.930]  I love it.
[16:22.930 --> 16:25.370]  5'8", 77 is one of my favorite shows.
[16:25.370 --> 16:28.370]  5'22", 77, all of that run.
[16:28.370 --> 16:30.370]  Anyway, I'm rambling now.
[16:30.370 --> 16:33.690]  If you're not a Deadhead, that doesn't mean any shit to you, but the Pembroke Pines, Florida
[16:33.690 --> 16:34.690]  show was so hot.
[16:34.690 --> 16:40.130]  So 77, GD number 77 is why that got called that.
[16:40.130 --> 16:44.730]  So now just to recap, because I did get rambling and I want to make sure that I said this correctly,
[16:44.730 --> 16:48.410]  I took the Deadhead OG, I selfed it from those seeds.
[16:48.410 --> 16:49.810]  I found a winner.
[16:49.810 --> 16:52.710]  That winner got labeled the Grateful Dog.
[16:52.710 --> 16:54.350]  Now that is the Grateful Dog.
[16:54.350 --> 16:59.610]  The seeds that went out for retail that were given away at the Cannabis Cups, that was
[16:59.610 --> 17:01.490]  Grateful Dog selfed.
[17:01.490 --> 17:03.970]  So I selfed that one and put those out.
[17:03.970 --> 17:09.010]  Then eventually I took the pollen from the original Deadhead OG and put it on the Grateful
[17:09.010 --> 17:13.050]  Dog that I had selected, the winner that I had been reversing again and putting out.
[17:13.050 --> 17:15.370]  I put the original pollen on that.
[17:15.370 --> 17:17.890]  I wasn't sure what I was doing at the time.
[17:17.890 --> 17:22.050]  That is sort of a feminized bat cross, but I put the pollen on that.
[17:22.050 --> 17:24.630]  That created GD 77.
[17:24.630 --> 17:27.290]  So it was Deadhead OG selfed.
[17:27.290 --> 17:28.850]  That made the Grateful Dog.
[17:28.850 --> 17:33.290]  Then I put the pollen from the Deadhead back on the Grateful Dog, the seeds that came from
[17:33.290 --> 17:34.290]  that.
[17:34.290 --> 17:38.830]  My favorite keeper is DH 70 or GD 77.
[17:38.830 --> 17:41.650]  Now let's talk a little bit about number 77.
[17:41.650 --> 17:45.370]  77 has a hard time being reversed.
[17:45.370 --> 17:50.730]  I have hit it with the whole bottle of silver thiosulfate and that plant does not reverse.
[17:50.730 --> 17:52.570]  It does not want to give me pollen.
[17:52.570 --> 17:56.730]  So I have not been able to breed much with 77 as a pollen donor.
[17:56.730 --> 17:59.810]  It has been given pollen, but it has never given me pollen.
[17:59.810 --> 18:01.530]  That one is super stingy.
[18:01.530 --> 18:03.090]  Don't be stingy, Mark.
[18:03.090 --> 18:05.250]  77 is not going to give me any pollen.
[18:05.250 --> 18:06.670]  It will not be bred with.
[18:06.670 --> 18:09.430]  So I can only use it as a female.
[18:09.430 --> 18:12.610]  So that is number 77.
[18:12.610 --> 18:18.490]  I think I made it clear where the Deadhead OG, the Grateful Dog and 77 have come from
[18:18.490 --> 18:19.650]  through the magic of editing.
[18:19.650 --> 18:21.690]  That should be super clear by now.
[18:21.690 --> 18:25.170]  Now the way that this conversation came up is we were talking about genetics in a forum
[18:25.170 --> 18:31.010]  and somebody asked me how the Grateful Dog ended up in some of Colin's crosses from Ethos
[18:31.010 --> 18:32.010]  Genetics.
[18:32.010 --> 18:33.610]  That's a very good question.
[18:33.610 --> 18:35.750]  Colin and I are both here in Colorado.
[18:35.750 --> 18:40.430]  So there's a very great story that a lot of people have been waiting for around the story
[18:40.430 --> 18:45.190]  of how the Grateful Dog came from my hands and got to Colin's hands to make the Colin
[18:45.190 --> 18:48.870]  OG and a few other crosses that I think Ethos has made.
[18:48.870 --> 18:51.310]  So let's talk a little bit about that.
[18:51.310 --> 18:52.990]  This is a really fun story for me.
[18:52.990 --> 18:54.110]  All right, here we go.
[18:54.110 --> 18:58.230]  The official story of how Colin ended up with my Grateful Dog.
[18:58.230 --> 19:00.790]  Big shout out to Colin, big up to the Ethos.
[19:00.790 --> 19:04.430]  Shout out to the whole gang, holding it down over there, killing it, crushing it.
[19:04.430 --> 19:05.430]  Impressive, inspiring.
[19:05.430 --> 19:08.070]  All right, here is how they got my Grateful Dog.
[19:08.070 --> 19:09.590]  This is the official story.
[19:09.590 --> 19:11.310]  Gather around the campfire.
[19:11.310 --> 19:13.750]  I was at a reggae concert at Red Rocks.
[19:13.750 --> 19:16.270]  I'm pretty sure it was Reggae on the Rocks.
[19:16.270 --> 19:17.790]  Big surprise, right?
[19:17.790 --> 19:19.790]  Another surprise, I cannot remember which year it was.
[19:19.790 --> 19:22.430]  I could probably do some research, do some scrolling.
[19:22.430 --> 19:25.070]  The exact year is not important for my story right now.
[19:25.070 --> 19:28.710]  I do believe Revolution was playing at Reggae on the Rocks.
[19:28.710 --> 19:29.870]  That was a lot of years.
[19:29.870 --> 19:33.750]  But at that concert, I was smoking a bunch of joints.
[19:33.750 --> 19:38.070]  When I go to concerts, I roll up a bunch of joints, just a lot of joints.
[19:38.070 --> 19:40.950]  Back in the day, you had to sneak your weed into Red Rocks.
[19:40.950 --> 19:42.950]  They did not let you take weed in there.
[19:42.950 --> 19:45.430]  Once you got it in there, you could do whatever you wanted.
[19:45.430 --> 19:47.150]  But they would search you down quite well.
[19:47.150 --> 19:52.070]  So my theory, my strategy was to roll a bunch of joints and put them in every pocket, every
[19:52.070 --> 19:53.430]  spot on my body.
[19:53.430 --> 19:55.150]  So if they find these, I still got these.
[19:55.150 --> 19:57.150]  If they find these, I still got these.
[19:57.150 --> 19:59.990]  We would get a bunch of joints into Red Rocks.
[19:59.990 --> 20:03.830]  This lucky day, all of my joints made it into Red Rocks.
[20:03.830 --> 20:05.070]  So I'm at my spot.
[20:05.070 --> 20:06.350]  The band is playing.
[20:06.350 --> 20:10.510]  And I'm smoking joints after joints after joint because that's how you do it at a Reggae
[20:10.510 --> 20:11.590]  concert at Red Rocks.
[20:11.590 --> 20:14.590]  I would light up one joint, and as soon as it got done, I'd flick the roach and just
[20:14.590 --> 20:16.190]  light up another joint.
[20:16.190 --> 20:21.110]  And I smoked, I don't know, probably 10 or 12 joints before my favorite band that I wanted
[20:21.110 --> 20:22.110]  to see.
[20:22.110 --> 20:23.110]  It was probably Revolution.
[20:23.110 --> 20:24.110]  It was probably my favorite band at the time.
[20:24.110 --> 20:26.230]  I've grown out of that.
[20:26.230 --> 20:27.430]  I'm smoking a lot of joints.
[20:27.430 --> 20:31.550]  And this guy next to me is lighting joints and smoking them.
[20:31.550 --> 20:34.390]  And every time I light a joint, he lights another joint.
[20:34.390 --> 20:37.350]  And every time I light a joint, he lights another joint.
[20:37.350 --> 20:42.490]  And I noticed he's trying to, it's a friendly smoke competition sort of a thing.
[20:42.490 --> 20:46.550]  And eventually he leans over and he goes, man, your weed smells really good.
[20:46.550 --> 20:47.550]  And I was like, thank you, bro.
[20:47.550 --> 20:48.550]  And he goes, what do you got there?
[20:48.550 --> 20:49.990]  And I go, it's called the Grateful Dog.
[20:49.990 --> 20:50.990]  And he's like, I never heard of that.
[20:50.990 --> 20:52.350]  And I was like, I bred that.
[20:52.350 --> 20:54.390]  And he seemed skeptical at first.
[20:54.390 --> 20:59.030]  Which is at the time, everybody was a grower, a breeder.
[20:59.030 --> 21:01.430]  Everybody was getting into the illegal weed scene right then.
[21:01.430 --> 21:02.950]  That's when it was just cracking.
[21:02.950 --> 21:06.790]  So of course he's like, yeah, white guy dreadlocks, reggae concert, fucking of course you breed
[21:06.790 --> 21:07.790]  some weed.
[21:07.790 --> 21:13.190]  And I understand the skepticism because he replied with, well, I own this dispensary.
[21:13.190 --> 21:16.630]  And I was like, yeah, probably, maybe not sure, whatever.
[21:16.630 --> 21:18.070]  And so we're both like feeling each other out.
[21:18.070 --> 21:19.070]  Are we bullshitting each other?
[21:19.070 --> 21:22.230]  Or do we actually, and then he said a few things about the dispensary.
[21:22.230 --> 21:23.630]  And I was like, well, that's an actual fact.
[21:23.870 --> 21:26.070]  And I kind of know that about that place.
[21:26.070 --> 21:29.350]  I guess I can divulge where he worked and said that he was the owner.
[21:29.350 --> 21:32.650]  He said he was the owner of Mile High Green Cross in Denver.
[21:32.650 --> 21:35.310]  And they had just won the Cannabis Cup for the Banana Kush.
[21:35.310 --> 21:37.470]  They won first place for a Banana Kush.
[21:37.470 --> 21:41.430]  So this is the year, if you're looking for research to see which year this story happened,
[21:41.430 --> 21:45.670]  it was the year that Mile High Green Cross won the Banana Kush and the Denver Cannabis
[21:45.670 --> 21:46.670]  Cup.
[21:46.670 --> 21:47.670]  It's right around that time period.
[21:47.670 --> 21:51.730]  Right after that was a Red Rocks, Reggae on the Rocks concert with Revolution.
[21:51.730 --> 21:54.610]  This is where it happened in the middle of Red Rocks.
[21:54.610 --> 21:59.730]  Also side note, I like to sit behind the sound booth or right in front of the sound booth
[21:59.730 --> 22:00.730]  at Red Rocks.
[22:00.730 --> 22:03.770]  If you can get right in front of or behind the soundboard, there are a couple of great
[22:03.770 --> 22:05.310]  reasons advantages for that.
[22:05.310 --> 22:07.590]  First of all, the sound guy's ears are right there.
[22:07.590 --> 22:08.690]  It's going to sound the best.
[22:08.690 --> 22:11.570]  Be where the sound guy's ears are and you get the best sound.
[22:11.570 --> 22:12.570]  He dialed it in.
[22:12.570 --> 22:13.690]  He's hearing it right there.
[22:13.690 --> 22:15.210]  It's going to sound good right there.
[22:15.210 --> 22:19.850]  Also at the sound booth, you have a good likelihood of seeing some of the artists.
[22:19.850 --> 22:24.130]  There's a tunnel that runs from under the stage at Red Rocks down to the sound booth.
[22:24.130 --> 22:27.930]  When some of the artists get done playing, they go cruise through the tunnel and end
[22:27.930 --> 22:31.930]  up in the sound booth to watch their friends in the next band play.
[22:31.930 --> 22:35.170]  I've met a lot of Reggae artists just hanging out by the booth.
[22:35.170 --> 22:37.690]  They just got done playing and they end up back there to watch the next band.
[22:37.690 --> 22:41.090]  I've hung out with Morgan Heritage, Steel Pulse, lots of fucking bands just because
[22:41.090 --> 22:43.450]  I knew how to do that right there.
[22:43.450 --> 22:44.450]  We're at Red Rocks.
[22:44.450 --> 22:45.570]  I'm trying to get myself back on track.
[22:45.570 --> 22:46.570]  We're at Red Rocks.
[22:46.570 --> 22:47.650]  We're smoking a lot of joints.
[22:47.650 --> 22:49.690]  My buddy claims to own Mile High Green Cross.
[22:49.730 --> 22:51.690]  I claim to have bred this weed.
[22:51.690 --> 22:54.690]  My buddy is like, I'd really like to get a clone of that.
[22:54.690 --> 22:56.930]  I was like, oh man, I don't really give out clones.
[22:56.930 --> 22:58.450]  I wasn't giving out clones at the time.
[22:58.450 --> 23:00.530]  I wasn't selling clones.
[23:00.530 --> 23:04.490]  Then he goes, I'd give you $5000 for a clone.
[23:04.490 --> 23:10.010]  At the time, that was kind of unheard of in my realm, in my world, in my business, in
[23:10.010 --> 23:11.810]  my status, I guess.
[23:11.810 --> 23:14.250]  I was like, $5000 for a clone?
[23:14.250 --> 23:18.170]  I was like, here's my name, my number, my address, my Facebook, my Instagram, my social
[23:18.170 --> 23:19.530]  security number.
[23:20.370 --> 23:21.370]  Here's how you find me, bro.
[23:21.370 --> 23:24.810]  If you want to give me $5000 for a clone, we are going to be friends forever.
[23:24.810 --> 23:27.330]  He introduced himself and we became friends.
[23:27.330 --> 23:33.370]  I don't like to bring too many other people into my story right now because they're not
[23:33.370 --> 23:34.370]  here.
[23:34.370 --> 23:35.370]  They can't speak.
[23:35.370 --> 23:36.370]  I don't know if it's their bit.
[23:36.370 --> 23:38.610]  They're my, if I'm sharing someone else's business.
[23:38.610 --> 23:39.970]  That was my friend Noah.
[23:39.970 --> 23:40.970]  Big up to Noah.
[23:40.970 --> 23:41.970]  You may watch this.
[23:41.970 --> 23:42.970]  You may hear this.
[23:42.970 --> 23:43.970]  You may see this.
[23:43.970 --> 23:44.970]  I didn't say your last name.
[23:44.970 --> 23:45.970]  I wanted to.
[23:45.970 --> 23:46.970]  I think of him all as one word.
[23:46.970 --> 23:47.970]  His name is one word.
[23:47.970 --> 23:48.970]  Big up to my buddy Noah.
[23:49.410 --> 23:50.410]  He's a great guy.
[23:50.410 --> 23:53.850]  Noah was involved with Mile High Green Cross and he bought a clone of the Grateful Dog
[23:53.850 --> 23:58.770]  from me for $5000 cash.
[23:58.770 --> 23:59.970]  He came to get the clone.
[23:59.970 --> 24:04.050]  He met me at my house and he bought the clone from me.
[24:04.050 --> 24:06.810]  At the time, I will admit, my clone tech was garbage.
[24:06.810 --> 24:09.010]  I was not very good at cloning.
[24:09.010 --> 24:12.210]  My buddy Noah was like, bro, you need to learn how to use an easy cloner.
[24:12.210 --> 24:13.450]  I was like, an easy cloner?
[24:13.450 --> 24:14.450]  Teach me more.
[24:14.450 --> 24:15.930]  He showed me his easy cloner.
[24:15.930 --> 24:16.930]  He showed me pictures.
[24:16.930 --> 24:17.930]  I was like, that's fucking cool.
[24:18.530 --> 24:22.250]  Then he's like, I want a bunch more cuts from you because you have good plants.
[24:22.250 --> 24:24.050]  I was like, well, I've got an idea.
[24:24.050 --> 24:28.570]  You bring me an easy cloner and I will let you cut clones out of my garden and fill up
[24:28.570 --> 24:30.010]  the easy cloner.
[24:30.010 --> 24:33.210]  Then when they're ready, you can come get the cuts and leave the cloner here.
[24:33.210 --> 24:34.410]  It is mine.
[24:34.410 --> 24:39.770]  In exchange for cuts, he taught me how to set up and run the easy clone clone machine
[24:39.770 --> 24:44.370]  and brought me the big 90-sider or a 60-site clone machine.
[24:44.370 --> 24:46.210]  At the time, that was a really good deal for both of us.
[24:46.210 --> 24:50.450]  I got a teaching lesson on how to cut clones and now I can cut clones like a savage on
[24:50.450 --> 24:52.010]  one of those easy cloners.
[24:52.010 --> 24:53.850]  He got some really good genetics.
[24:53.850 --> 24:57.890]  We built a solid relationship because he would bring me a lot of good cuts.
[24:57.890 --> 25:02.810]  The Action Bronson cut that I used, that came from my buddy Noah.
[25:02.810 --> 25:07.170]  Some of the Prodigium that I used in The Prophet, that came from Noah.
[25:07.170 --> 25:08.170]  Also was an Ethos cut.
[25:08.170 --> 25:09.170]  Shout out to Ethos.
[25:09.170 --> 25:14.610]  A lot of the stuff I got came from our friend Noah at Mile High Green Cross.
[25:14.610 --> 25:19.370]  He ended up with the Grateful Dog cut was the moral of part of that story because there
[25:19.370 --> 25:20.370]  is more.
[25:20.370 --> 25:21.970]  The saga does continue.
[25:21.970 --> 25:25.530]  I did want to make sure to give him a shout out for teaching me how to cut clones in the
[25:25.530 --> 25:26.530]  easy cloner.
[25:26.530 --> 25:28.090]  That dude stepped up my game.
[25:28.090 --> 25:30.930]  So then he actually came to my house with the machine.
[25:30.930 --> 25:32.310]  We set it up.
[25:32.310 --> 25:35.930]  He literally went through my mother room and cut clones at his will.
[25:35.930 --> 25:38.690]  I let him have run of basically whatever he wanted in there.
[25:38.690 --> 25:41.810]  He cut the clones, put them in the cloner, showed me how to do it.
[25:41.810 --> 25:42.810]  I cut a few.
[25:42.810 --> 25:45.130]  I filled up the cloner, kept them alive for long enough to get roots.
[25:45.130 --> 25:46.490]  And he came and picked it up.
[25:46.490 --> 25:47.490]  He took the cuts.
[25:47.490 --> 25:48.490]  We potted the cuts.
[25:48.490 --> 25:52.970]  And then he left the cloner and we've been friends ever since and doing stuff ever since
[25:52.970 --> 25:53.970]  then.
[25:53.970 --> 25:54.970]  Okay.
[25:54.970 --> 25:58.210]  Then I'm not sure where the clone went from there.
[25:58.210 --> 26:02.450]  The clone was put into a commercial cultivation facility in Denver, Colorado.
[26:02.450 --> 26:03.730]  I don't know where.
[26:03.730 --> 26:07.210]  I know that it went to Mile High Green Cross and I know it had to have gone to another
[26:07.210 --> 26:08.650]  facility.
[26:08.650 --> 26:13.130]  The commercial cultivations are not in the same building as the dispensary.
[26:13.130 --> 26:16.050]  So if you work for Mile High Green Cross, it goes to your cultivation facility.
[26:16.050 --> 26:18.490]  And then from there you can spread it out.
[26:18.490 --> 26:20.610]  Back in the day, you could just spread it out wherever you want.
[26:20.610 --> 26:26.210]  So that Grateful Dog clone landed in the hands of my new friend, Noah, that I met at a Reggae
[26:26.210 --> 26:27.210]  on the Rocks concert.
[26:27.210 --> 26:28.210]  He bought the clone.
[26:28.210 --> 26:29.850]  He has now got the clone.
[26:29.850 --> 26:33.370]  Once he's got the clone, I probably asked him, don't do much with this.
[26:33.370 --> 26:34.370]  Don't give it out.
[26:34.370 --> 26:35.370]  It's my pride and joy.
[26:35.370 --> 26:38.130]  But as someone that gives out a clone who gave, he gave me money for it.
[26:38.610 --> 26:39.610]  He could do basically whatever he wants.
[26:39.610 --> 26:40.610]  Right?
[26:40.610 --> 26:41.610]  That's his.
[26:41.610 --> 26:42.610]  That's his plant.
[26:42.610 --> 26:43.610]  He can make clones.
[26:43.610 --> 26:44.610]  He can breed to it.
[26:44.610 --> 26:45.610]  He could play with it.
[26:45.610 --> 26:48.010]  So it was in a commercial cultivation facility, which got sold.
[26:48.010 --> 26:49.450]  That is just how the industry works.
[26:49.450 --> 26:53.570]  People will sell their cultivation if they want to buy another one or sell too small
[26:53.570 --> 26:54.570]  and buy a big one.
[26:54.570 --> 26:56.530]  Or sometimes licenses just sell.
[26:56.530 --> 26:58.470]  Sometimes people get bored of being in the industry.
[26:58.470 --> 27:00.850]  The cultivation in which that plant was got sold.
[27:00.850 --> 27:03.410]  And when you sell the facility, the plants come with it.
[27:03.410 --> 27:04.650]  You don't go clear out the plants.
[27:04.650 --> 27:06.090]  You just give them the, here's everything.
[27:06.090 --> 27:07.130]  You keep it moving.
[27:07.130 --> 27:09.090]  The new ownership takes over a running machine.
[27:09.090 --> 27:11.410]  So that way there's no downtime, no stalls.
[27:11.410 --> 27:13.530]  That's just a cordial way to do business.
[27:13.530 --> 27:15.170]  So the facility was sold.
[27:15.170 --> 27:21.290]  I'm not sure if it was sold to another person who I didn't know at the time, but later on
[27:21.290 --> 27:22.450]  became a good friend.
[27:22.450 --> 27:24.490]  And I would almost call him a mentor and a teacher.
[27:24.490 --> 27:27.650]  He's definitely a teacher, kind of a mentor to me.
[27:27.650 --> 27:28.850]  I didn't know him at the time.
[27:28.850 --> 27:35.050]  I think he may have purchased the facility from my friend Noah, or it was directly sold
[27:35.170 --> 27:38.290]  to Colin or one of Colin's partners from Ethos.
[27:38.290 --> 27:39.730]  I don't know those details.
[27:39.730 --> 27:41.610]  It's none of my, it's not really my business.
[27:41.610 --> 27:47.730]  I didn't do a lot of research there, but the clone went from Noah to a commercial facility,
[27:47.730 --> 27:53.690]  his facility that got sold to a guy by another guy with the initials of possibly RJ.
[27:53.690 --> 27:56.330]  If you're watching, if you're old school, if you worked at Three Rivers, you know who
[27:56.330 --> 27:57.330]  I'm talking about.
[27:57.330 --> 27:58.330]  His name does not need to be out there.
[27:58.330 --> 28:03.550]  I went to possibly RJ, then to Colin from Ethos or Colin's team.
[28:03.550 --> 28:06.710]  That is how Colin from Ethos acquired My Grateful Dog.
[28:06.710 --> 28:12.150]  From there, he made the Colin OG from it, which has been a hugely successful strain.
[28:12.150 --> 28:17.950]  So that, my friends, is the story of how Colin Gordon of Ethos ended up with the Grateful
[28:17.950 --> 28:18.950]  Dog clone.
[28:18.950 --> 28:22.510]  To the best of my knowledge, I'm not trying to start any beef, stir up any shit with any
[28:22.510 --> 28:23.510]  misinformation.
[28:23.510 --> 28:28.110]  If I said something wrong, misspoke, that's because I'm a stoner and details slip through.
[28:28.110 --> 28:31.750]  I got nothing but love and respect for everybody involved in that story.
[28:31.750 --> 28:36.870]  Big up to Noah, big up to the other guy labeled RJ, big up to our buddy Colin and the entire
[28:36.870 --> 28:40.070]  team at Ethos.
[28:40.070 --> 28:43.270]  That is basically what I've got for that story.
[28:43.270 --> 28:48.390]  I made it from a Deadhead OG seed, found a selection from there, selfed that, put those
[28:48.390 --> 28:54.030]  seeds out, got inspired to put the pollen from the original onto my offspring because
[28:54.030 --> 28:55.590]  that's just weird shit that breeders do.
[28:55.590 --> 28:56.910]  And that made number 77.
[28:56.910 --> 28:59.190]  77 hasn't gone anywhere.
[28:59.190 --> 29:00.190]  That stays in my grow.
[29:00.190 --> 29:02.630]  I've got seeds in a clone of that.
[29:02.630 --> 29:05.590]  Met my buddy Noah at a reggae concert, sold him the clone.
[29:05.590 --> 29:06.870]  Big up to Noah.
[29:06.870 --> 29:11.870]  That clone either went directly to Colin or it went to a middleman.
[29:11.870 --> 29:13.230]  Now it is all over the place.
[29:13.230 --> 29:15.790]  It has been bred to.
[29:15.790 --> 29:17.110]  That's the story and I'm sticking to it.
[29:17.110 --> 29:22.230]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, concerns, updates, positive feedback, you
[29:22.230 --> 29:25.670]  want to know more details, you have specific questions, I would love to entertain those
[29:25.670 --> 29:26.670]  things.
[29:26.670 --> 29:27.670]  You can send me an email.
[29:27.670 --> 29:28.670]  My email address is growfromyourheart.com.
