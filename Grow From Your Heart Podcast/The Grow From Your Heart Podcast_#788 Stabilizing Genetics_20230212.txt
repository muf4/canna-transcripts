[00:02.110 --> 00:24.040]  Welcome to the show, Internet world.
[00:24.040 --> 00:25.840]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.840 --> 00:30.420]  This is episode 789 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:30.420 --> 00:33.120]  In this episode, I'm going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:33.120 --> 00:34.120]  That's right.
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.880]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away a free pack of iRegenetic seeds.
[00:38.880 --> 00:40.240]  Stay tuned later in the episode.
[00:40.240 --> 00:43.640]  I will teach you how to win that free pack of seeds.
[00:43.640 --> 00:47.640]  In this episode, I want to talk about stabilization in cannabis plants.
[00:47.640 --> 00:51.340]  It has come to my attention that a lot of the cannabis world, a lot of the horticulture
[00:51.340 --> 00:55.700]  and growing world does not exactly understand what the word stabilization means when it
[00:55.700 --> 00:57.560]  comes to our plants.
[00:57.560 --> 01:01.320]  Oftentimes I see people post to the internet that they got a pack of seeds and they discovered
[01:01.320 --> 01:05.100]  intersex plants within that package of seeds and they will attribute that to what they
[01:05.100 --> 01:07.760]  call unstable genetics.
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.640]  Now that may be part of the problem, but that is not exactly what stability means when
[01:11.640 --> 01:13.820]  it comes to cannabis plants.
[01:13.820 --> 01:18.280]  In the plant world, in the horticultural world, in the botanical world, stability means that
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.960]  if we grew out a large batch of seeds that we will not see multiple phenotypes in that
[01:22.960 --> 01:27.800]  population, that we will see stability, that all of those phenotypes will be uniform.
[01:27.800 --> 01:31.400]  If you drive through a farmland state, one of those states where there's a bunch of corn,
[01:31.400 --> 01:35.320]  maybe Nebraska, maybe you see a bunch of soybeans, maybe you're going through Kansas.
[01:35.320 --> 01:39.000]  As you drive down the road, you will notice that every single one of those corn plants
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.120]  looks exactly the same and all those soybeans look exactly the same.
[01:42.120 --> 01:44.360]  Now you're going to say that's genetic modification.
[01:44.360 --> 01:47.440]  That's probably part of it, but also that is breeding for stability.
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.440]  Those plants have been bred to be that phenotype, to all be stable because we can't run, if
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.320]  you've got acres and acres of corn or acres and acres of soybeans, you can't have some
[01:56.320 --> 01:59.240]  corn that gets really tall, some corn that stays really short.
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.240]  We need uniformity.
[02:00.240 --> 02:01.400]  It makes it easier to water.
[02:01.640 --> 02:05.360]  It makes it easier to basically maintain and care for that crop and it makes harvesting
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.680]  and processing much easier if everything is uniform.
[02:08.680 --> 02:13.080]  And also the customers, the clients, the people buying that produce, the corn, the soybeans,
[02:13.080 --> 02:15.880]  whatever produce, they expect uniformity as well.
[02:15.880 --> 02:21.680]  So uniformity is basically what we are talking about when it comes to stability in the botanical
[02:21.680 --> 02:22.680]  world.
[02:22.680 --> 02:24.720]  Now let's talk about how we achieve that.
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.000]  Creating a stable line is all about selective breeding and good breeding practices.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.280]  The most important thing is starting with quality plants, plants that have been stress
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.360]  tested, plants that have been through the ringer, plants that you know are quality breeding
[02:37.360 --> 02:38.360]  plants.
[02:38.360 --> 02:41.420]  So if we are breeding cannabis, if we're breeding corn, if we're breeding soybeans, whatever
[02:41.420 --> 02:45.800]  you are breeding, one of the most important things to think about is the starting plants.
[02:45.800 --> 02:47.880]  Do we have quality starting material?
[02:47.880 --> 02:52.520]  If you start with a plant, let's just, I like to refer to cooking and baking or being in
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.520]  the kitchen.
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.240]  If you start with ingredients that don't taste good, your food will not come out tasting
[02:57.240 --> 02:58.240]  good.
[02:58.240 --> 02:59.800]  You're going to get more crap and more crap in a pot.
[02:59.800 --> 03:03.200]  No matter how much you cook it, how much you stir it, how much you bake it, still going
[03:03.200 --> 03:05.080]  to taste like crap in a pot.
[03:05.080 --> 03:06.080]  Breeding is the same way.
[03:06.080 --> 03:07.840]  You have to start with quality plants.
[03:07.840 --> 03:09.600]  You can't start with crap plants.
[03:09.600 --> 03:11.040]  You can't start with intersex plants.
[03:11.040 --> 03:14.500]  You can't start with problematic plants or guess what you're going to breed?
[03:14.500 --> 03:16.360]  More intersex problematic plants.
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.800]  So it is all about selective breeding and selecting quality plants to begin with.
[03:20.800 --> 03:24.280]  Now I said that one of the most important things to think about when it comes to breeding
[03:24.280 --> 03:26.280]  is starting with quality plants.
[03:26.280 --> 03:29.520]  Another very important thing to think about is having a goal.
[03:29.520 --> 03:30.520]  What is your goal?
[03:30.520 --> 03:31.600]  What are you trying to create?
[03:31.600 --> 03:33.240]  What are you trying to produce?
[03:33.240 --> 03:36.720]  What's your goal with this breeding project that you are working on?
[03:36.720 --> 03:39.580]  Especially if we are going to work it to F4, F5.
[03:39.580 --> 03:43.320]  If our main goal is to come out with a strain where every seed looks the same, wouldn't
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.200]  it be a good idea to start with a solid goal, with a solid idea of what we want?
[03:47.200 --> 03:50.080]  So a couple of the most important things to think about when it comes to breeding are
[03:50.080 --> 03:51.840]  starting with quality plants.
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.400]  And the next thing I always talk about having in mind is breeding with a goal.
[03:55.400 --> 03:56.400]  What's your purpose?
[03:56.400 --> 03:57.840]  What are you trying to create?
[03:57.840 --> 04:00.160]  So now let's say we've got two plants in mind.
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.840]  We know they are good breeding candidates.
[04:01.840 --> 04:03.040]  We've tested them.
[04:03.040 --> 04:05.200]  We know that they are not intersex plants.
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.740]  We know that they handle stress well.
[04:06.740 --> 04:09.320]  We know that they handle environmental change as well.
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.640]  We know that they're pest and pathogen resistant.
[04:11.640 --> 04:12.960]  So now we've got two plants.
[04:12.960 --> 04:14.400]  Now we kind of have an idea.
[04:14.400 --> 04:16.860]  Now let's write down a solid breeding goal.
[04:16.860 --> 04:19.920]  When we breed these plants together, we're going to see a lot of different expressions
[04:19.920 --> 04:22.000]  through the different filial generations.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.360]  We need to make a guideline now of what we are looking for so that the plants don't throw
[04:26.360 --> 04:27.360]  you off.
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.160]  Sometimes you'll have an idea, you'll grow the plants, and then you'll say, you know
[04:30.160 --> 04:31.760]  what, I want to go this direction.
[04:31.760 --> 04:33.280]  That's going to mess up your breeding.
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.560]  Stay on the map that you made in the very beginning and make that other direction a
[04:36.560 --> 04:37.560]  B project.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.560]  Let's do that later.
[04:38.560 --> 04:40.360]  Let's do that at another time.
[04:40.360 --> 04:45.280]  Maybe simultaneously if possible, but draw that roadmap and stay on your map because
[04:45.280 --> 04:48.960]  the plants like to kind of give you ideas and throw you off and your friends are going
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.720]  to give you input and the internet's going to give you input.
[04:51.720 --> 04:56.440]  Follow the original idea and get to where we are going and see how we can do that with
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.440]  the map that we've drawn.
[04:57.440 --> 05:00.640]  And then later on, we'll learn how to branch off and do other sideship, but let's stay
[05:00.640 --> 05:03.960]  focused if we're trying to make a stable line here.
[05:03.960 --> 05:05.840]  Now let's talk about stabilizing these plants.
[05:05.840 --> 05:07.280]  We've got two plants.
[05:07.280 --> 05:08.880]  Hopefully you've got a male and a female.
[05:08.880 --> 05:10.520]  That's the way that this is going to work.
[05:10.520 --> 05:13.280]  One of the things I would also recommend at this time is starting with plants that are
[05:13.280 --> 05:15.420]  completely different from each other.
[05:15.420 --> 05:19.200]  Plants that are too similar to each other just breed more similar shit.
[05:19.200 --> 05:23.680]  So find something that maybe has, let's talk specifically about my cross arise.
[05:23.680 --> 05:26.760]  Arise was a very successful cross because of this factor.
[05:26.760 --> 05:28.480]  I used a golden goat female.
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.060]  Let me describe golden goat to you very briefly.
[05:31.060 --> 05:35.920]  Golden goat is kind of known as a tropical sativa, but it also grows short and squat.
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.080]  So it's got a really nice sativa kind of head buzz, really tropical flavors, and it makes
[05:40.080 --> 05:44.400]  really skinny leaves, but it doesn't get super tall like most sativas and you can harvest
[05:44.400 --> 05:47.440]  it a little more early than most of the other sativa plants.
[05:47.440 --> 05:51.760]  It'll come down around week nine, which is a great trait for a sativa kind of buzz type
[05:51.760 --> 05:52.760]  of plant.
[05:52.760 --> 05:56.680]  So it's got those skinnier leaves, that tropical flavor, that sativa style buzz.
[05:56.680 --> 06:02.480]  Then I took a daybreaker plant, which is Joseph OG and chem D that puts off a lot of a gassy
[06:02.480 --> 06:08.700]  chemicals, a burnt rubber, fresh tennis ball kind of smells and aromas completely different
[06:08.700 --> 06:11.480]  than that tropical sweet candy and the golden goat.
[06:11.480 --> 06:13.560]  It also put off big gigantic leaves.
[06:13.560 --> 06:15.600]  The leaves are so big on that plant.
[06:15.600 --> 06:18.120]  It also makes a lot of crazy purple colors.
[06:18.120 --> 06:20.300]  So I knew that those were completely different.
[06:20.300 --> 06:23.560]  So I bred them together to create something brand new.
[06:23.560 --> 06:26.520]  And in my opinion, in my experience, it worked very well.
[06:26.520 --> 06:30.360]  So something I'll recommend at this time is start with plants that are very different.
[06:30.360 --> 06:34.640]  If you can find a male and a female that are very far apart in traits and flavor, aroma,
[06:34.640 --> 06:39.720]  growth structure, I think that is when you have the best success in creating new lines.
[06:39.720 --> 06:42.680]  So with that in mind, we've got two plants.
[06:42.680 --> 06:43.960]  Hopefully they're vastly different.
[06:43.960 --> 06:47.640]  If not, your breeding project will work with your goal if you've got a goal in mind, but
[06:47.640 --> 06:50.680]  I have more fun when they're way further apart.
[06:50.680 --> 06:54.440]  So I've got my male, I've got my female, we've got a breeding goal in mind.
[06:54.440 --> 06:56.760]  Now the first thing to do is chuck some pollen.
[06:56.760 --> 06:58.880]  Let's put some pollen on this female plant.
[06:58.880 --> 07:00.720]  Then we're going to make seeds.
[07:00.720 --> 07:05.220]  This batch of seeds is called the F1 generation, the first filial generation.
[07:05.220 --> 07:06.220]  These are brand new seeds.
[07:06.220 --> 07:07.220]  They've never been made.
[07:07.220 --> 07:08.220]  It's a new cross.
[07:08.220 --> 07:09.520]  That is the F1.
[07:09.520 --> 07:12.800]  So from that F1 batch of seeds, we will grow them out.
[07:12.800 --> 07:15.120]  Pay very close attention to what you've done.
[07:15.120 --> 07:16.600]  Are there any intersex problems?
[07:16.600 --> 07:17.600]  Are there mutants?
[07:17.600 --> 07:18.600]  Are there freaks?
[07:18.600 --> 07:19.600]  Do you have germination issues?
[07:19.600 --> 07:23.120]  Or are these quality plants that you're enjoying the outcome from?
[07:23.120 --> 07:24.480]  Do you like growing them?
[07:24.480 --> 07:25.480]  Do they grow well?
[07:25.480 --> 07:27.140]  Do they handle problems well?
[07:27.140 --> 07:29.660]  Are you seeing the phenotypes that you were hoping for?
[07:29.660 --> 07:31.000]  So grow those out.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.560]  What I would recommend now is finding the phenotype that you were looking for.
[07:34.560 --> 07:37.680]  When you wrote down your goal, you said, I want to find this.
[07:37.680 --> 07:42.520]  You want a plant that grows with this shape, this structure, this flowering time, this
[07:42.520 --> 07:44.120]  flavor, this aroma.
[07:44.120 --> 07:45.580]  It's got to work in your grow.
[07:45.580 --> 07:47.580]  Some people run a scrog.
[07:47.580 --> 07:50.260]  Some people run a big wide open plant.
[07:50.260 --> 07:52.700]  Some people top them one time and let them bush out.
[07:52.700 --> 07:55.440]  Some people only veg them up six inches tall and flip them.
[07:55.440 --> 07:58.440]  Do the seeds that you made work for your grow style?
[07:58.440 --> 08:01.540]  Can you find the phenotype that is perfect for your grow?
[08:01.540 --> 08:04.080]  If so, let's continue with this breeding project.
[08:04.080 --> 08:07.640]  If you're not finding the seed that you want, the plant that you want doesn't come out of
[08:07.640 --> 08:11.360]  there, then this is not a successful breeding project, which is not a big deal.
[08:11.360 --> 08:12.840]  I would abandon this for now.
[08:12.840 --> 08:17.380]  Keep those seeds and then pollinate with different plants and different females and try it again
[08:17.380 --> 08:19.920]  until you do find the cross that you're looking for.
[08:19.920 --> 08:22.680]  Not every cross will be a winner every single time.
[08:22.680 --> 08:27.200]  It definitely might not be what you're looking for the first time you make seeds.
[08:27.200 --> 08:32.840]  So my point here, make that first filial generation, grow them out, find the one that is exactly
[08:32.840 --> 08:34.400]  what you're looking for.
[08:34.400 --> 08:37.240]  We've got to do very careful selections at this point.
[08:37.240 --> 08:39.960]  We've got to find exactly what we're looking for.
[08:39.960 --> 08:43.400]  Find a male plant and a female plant that have got the traits you're looking for.
[08:43.400 --> 08:49.140]  Like I said, the leaf shape, the plant structure, the node spacing, the type of branching.
[08:49.140 --> 08:51.140]  Does it react well to what you want to do?
[08:51.140 --> 08:52.880]  Find the girl in there for you.
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.120]  Also find the male plant in there for you.
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.640]  Now guess what we're going to do again?
[08:56.640 --> 08:59.480]  We're going to grow the boy, we're going to grow the girl, and we're going to chuck some
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.480]  pollen.
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.760]  We are now making the F2 generation.
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.800]  The F1s now just bred together.
[09:05.800 --> 09:07.360]  They make F2.
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.480]  Now these F2s are going to show you a lot of crazy shit.
[09:11.480 --> 09:16.880]  The phenotype variation in the F1 won't be as wild as the F2s, but you'll see a lot of
[09:16.880 --> 09:17.880]  stuff.
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.560]  In the F1s you're going to see plants that look 50-50 like the mom and dad, some plants
[09:22.560 --> 09:25.800]  that lean more toward the mom, and some plants that lean toward the dad, and then you'll
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.320]  see some weirdos in there.
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.920]  In the F2, we're going to see plants that look like the mom, we're going to see plants
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.440]  that look like the dad, we're going to see plants that are anywhere between 1 and 100%
[09:35.440 --> 09:37.240]  the mom and the opposite the dad.
[09:37.240 --> 09:43.360]  You could have 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, either direction mom and dad in this batch of seeds.
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.240]  Also, we're going to see grandparents represent themselves.
[09:47.240 --> 09:50.760]  Whatever was used to make the plants that you used, the parents of those plants, they're
[09:50.760 --> 09:53.440]  going to pop up now and they go, hey, here we are, do you remember me?
[09:53.440 --> 09:55.800]  I'm the great grandma, or I'm the grandma you forgot about.
[09:55.800 --> 09:57.560]  I'm the grandpa that you forgot about.
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.160]  They're going to pop up and say, what are these weird traits?
[10:00.160 --> 10:01.640]  Why are the plants doing that?
[10:01.640 --> 10:04.280]  That's from grandma, that's from grandpa, on either side.
[10:04.280 --> 10:07.920]  You've got four grandparents and two parents that can represent themselves here on this
[10:07.920 --> 10:09.320]  cross at this time.
[10:09.320 --> 10:11.880]  Also, you're going to see some weird shit.
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.160]  We just took the whole genetic gene pool and put all of the traits in there, every color
[10:16.160 --> 10:20.480]  of eyes, every color of hair, every type of skin and teeth you can imagine.
[10:20.480 --> 10:23.640]  We just shook it up and we're going to get some weird-looking cousins out of this.
[10:23.640 --> 10:25.520]  That's what we're going to see in the F2s.
[10:25.520 --> 10:29.920]  It is your job in that F2 generation to find the plant that has the traits you want.
[10:29.920 --> 10:31.640]  I'm going to keep saying that.
[10:31.640 --> 10:34.440]  Find the plant that is perfect to continue this line.
[10:34.440 --> 10:38.360]  This is the one that is going to represent the next line, so it's got to be the perfect
[10:38.360 --> 10:39.560]  plant for you.
[10:39.560 --> 10:43.280]  Does it have, I'm going to keep saying it, the leaf size and shape, the plant structure,
[10:43.280 --> 10:45.520]  the internodal spacing, the branching?
[10:45.520 --> 10:46.520]  Does it finish on time?
[10:46.520 --> 10:49.120]  Does it react well to what you do?
[10:49.120 --> 10:51.380]  If it does, that's the one that you want to keep.
[10:51.380 --> 10:54.520]  Find that female, find that male, then guess what we're going to do?
[10:54.520 --> 10:56.040]  It's time for them to get it on again.
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.760]  We're going to make the F3 generation.
[10:58.760 --> 11:03.400]  In this F3 generation, this is where we start doing a little bit of the stabilization.
[11:03.400 --> 11:07.520]  We have gotten rid of that F2, the wildness out of the F2 generation.
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.880]  The F3s are starting to lock in a little bit.
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.600]  We're starting to see a little bit more uniformity, which is the idea of stabilization.
[11:14.600 --> 11:17.080]  That is what stabilization is.
[11:17.080 --> 11:18.080]  What are we going to do again?
[11:18.080 --> 11:19.520]  We're going to grow out these F3s.
[11:19.520 --> 11:20.600]  We're going to find a female.
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.480]  We're going to find a male, like I keep talking about with the exact perfect traits that we
[11:24.480 --> 11:26.800]  wrote down, the goal that we are seeking.
[11:26.840 --> 11:29.160]  We want to find that plant once again.
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.280]  If it's not in there, that's not a big deal.
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.920]  Go back and grow more of those F2s and find those.
[11:33.920 --> 11:37.840]  If you have to go all the way back to the F1s and make F2 again, do that.
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.060]  Never be afraid to go backwards and run more of those old seeds.
[11:41.060 --> 11:43.680]  You might not have found what you were looking for because you might not even have known
[11:43.680 --> 11:47.120]  what you were looking for at that time, or maybe it just didn't pop up.
[11:47.120 --> 11:48.640]  But let's run that F3.
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.360]  Let's find the perfect one.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.360]  Then what are we going to do?
[11:51.360 --> 11:54.160]  We're going to pollinate that F3 with another F3.
[11:54.160 --> 11:55.160]  That's going to make F4.
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.680]  We're getting super close to stabilizing this plant.
[11:58.680 --> 12:04.280]  At this point, you should have probably 70% to 80% of your phenotypes looking fairly uniform
[12:04.280 --> 12:06.280]  if we have done the selection properly.
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.920]  Again, the only way to tell if we are doing this properly is to grow out large batches
[12:10.920 --> 12:11.920]  of these seeds.
[12:11.920 --> 12:13.720]  Grow out as many as you can.
[12:13.720 --> 12:16.120]  I would like to see 1,000 of them if possible.
[12:16.120 --> 12:19.720]  I understand that that is not possible for everybody.
[12:19.720 --> 12:20.720]  I'm spoiled.
[12:20.720 --> 12:21.720]  I'm blessed.
[12:21.720 --> 12:25.320]  I'm here in Colorado where I've got access to commercial grow facilities.
[12:25.320 --> 12:27.200]  I've got access to a lot of friends that grow.
[12:27.200 --> 12:28.440]  I can give them seeds.
[12:28.440 --> 12:31.640]  I can actually rent space from my friends who are no longer growing and grow in their
[12:31.640 --> 12:32.640]  grow spaces.
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.840]  If I'm renting grow space from you and I'm producing seed or flower in your space, big
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.840]  up and thank you.
[12:37.840 --> 12:39.840]  That does help me a lot.
[12:39.840 --> 12:42.040]  I recommend 1,000 of these seeds if possible.
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.360]  I understand that's not possible for most people.
[12:45.360 --> 12:46.360]  Maybe do 100.
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.280]  Also, I understand that that is not legal for most people.
[12:49.720 --> 12:51.840]  I'm going to say follow the rules where you are.
[12:51.840 --> 12:53.320]  Don't get yourself in any trouble.
[12:53.320 --> 12:54.480]  But also, you're a fucking adult.
[12:54.480 --> 12:55.480]  Do what you want to do.
[12:55.480 --> 12:57.440]  I'm just trying to keep myself out of trouble.
[12:57.440 --> 13:02.480]  If you can't run 1,000 or 100 seeds at a time, you probably can run 10 at a time.
[13:02.480 --> 13:04.040]  Can you run 10 of them?
[13:04.040 --> 13:05.120]  Maybe run 10.
[13:05.120 --> 13:06.280]  Find the best one for now.
[13:06.280 --> 13:08.360]  Set it in a corner and keep it as a keeper plant.
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.400]  Then run nine more and just keep doing that until you just eliminate a few until you are
[13:12.400 --> 13:15.280]  satisfied that that is the one that you're looking for.
[13:15.280 --> 13:16.760]  There's ways to phenol hunt large batches.
[13:16.760 --> 13:18.520]  It just may take more time.
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.920]  I think I was at F4 when I got off on a rambly tangent there.
[13:21.920 --> 13:24.480]  From that F4, we are going to do the same process.
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.480]  We're going to grow them out.
[13:25.480 --> 13:28.800]  We're going to find the plant that has the exact traits that I'm looking for.
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.800]  It should be easy to find by now because by this F4 generation, we're seeing a lot of
[13:32.800 --> 13:33.800]  uniformity.
[13:33.800 --> 13:36.200]  Things are starting to really stabilize and settle in.
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.280]  We're going to find that female that looks exactly like all of the traits we wrote down,
[13:40.280 --> 13:44.420]  the flowering time, the growth structure, the node spacing, the branching, the leaf
[13:44.420 --> 13:46.500]  size and shape, colors, aromas.
[13:46.500 --> 13:47.840]  We should be smoking all of these.
[13:47.840 --> 13:49.960]  Have you found out if it's got the buzz you want?
[13:49.960 --> 13:51.160]  Does it have the turps you want?
[13:51.160 --> 13:53.400]  Is this the perfect plant for you?
[13:53.400 --> 13:56.600]  Find that F4 generation, find a boy, find a girl.
[13:56.600 --> 13:59.360]  Also by this point, you should be pretty good at selecting male plants.
[13:59.360 --> 14:00.600]  That's going to be the real challenge.
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.040]  But find that male, find that girl, let them do some pollen chucking.
[14:04.040 --> 14:06.280]  At this point, you've now created F5.
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.920]  In this F5 generation, we're going to see really uniform plants among this population.
[14:10.920 --> 14:14.200]  A lot of the plants are going to look very, very similar.
[14:14.200 --> 14:16.600]  We are now reaching our goal of stabilization.
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.120]  At this point, if you grew 100 seeds, you should probably get 10 plants that don't fit
[14:21.120 --> 14:25.880]  in but the other 90 are probably going to look just like each other.
[14:25.880 --> 14:31.240]  The next step, obviously, if you want to lock this in even more, is to go to the F6 generation.
[14:31.240 --> 14:35.160]  I personally don't know any breeders that go to the F6 or beyond.
[14:35.160 --> 14:38.200]  Perhaps DJ Short is hitting the F6 generation.
[14:38.200 --> 14:42.520]  But the last I read, when he was selling seeds, he would take them to F5 and then stop.
[14:42.520 --> 14:46.240]  That way he would leave us room to breed to them because if he goes any further, it kind
[14:46.240 --> 14:49.600]  of locks in all of the traits that he created, that he selected.
[14:49.600 --> 14:52.240]  And when we breed to it, that's all that's going to come out as those traits because
[14:52.240 --> 14:54.000]  that's all that's left.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.360]  That segues me into the next part of talking about breeding and stabilization.
[14:59.360 --> 15:04.000]  You can accidentally stabilize negative traits if you don't pay attention.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.480]  Negative traits could be intersex or whatever you're not looking for.
[15:07.480 --> 15:12.240]  If that is in your population of breeding anywhere, if you see that and you pass that
[15:12.240 --> 15:16.560]  on in the breeding, you could stabilize a negative trait that you weren't looking for.
[15:16.560 --> 15:18.600]  So make sure you grow out a lot of seeds.
[15:18.600 --> 15:20.400]  Make sure you do a lot of testing.
[15:20.400 --> 15:24.600]  Make sure that you grow every batch, a large population of every batch if possible, and
[15:24.600 --> 15:26.440]  select the best plants from that batch.
[15:26.440 --> 15:30.360]  If you were seeing any problems, maybe go backwards and breed from other batches and
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.560]  select better.
[15:31.560 --> 15:35.640]  Maybe you just selected the one that carries an intersex trait or one that doesn't speed
[15:35.640 --> 15:37.280]  up, doesn't flower quickly enough.
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.400]  You can go back and find better plants if you wanted to do it again.
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.680]  Or you could also back cross for one of those better generations.
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.960]  If you've got a plant that's super close in the F4 generation, you could take an F1, F2
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.320]  and pollinate that with it.
[15:49.320 --> 15:50.760]  It'll give you the traits you're looking for.
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.320]  But my advice is to keep going forward and keep making it better.
[15:54.320 --> 15:57.560]  And if you make a mistake, go back to where you made the mistake and then move forward
[15:57.560 --> 15:58.560]  from there again.
[15:58.560 --> 16:02.320]  Now a second ago, I did mention back crossing, which leads me into another thing that I would
[16:02.320 --> 16:04.720]  like to kind of ramble about for a minute here.
[16:04.720 --> 16:08.600]  When I think about breeding, sometimes I'm thinking about locking in traits.
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.480]  But another thing I'm also thinking about is washing out traits.
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.280]  Now let's talk a little bit about washing out traits.
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.040]  And the reason I want to use back cross as a kind of a guideline for this is because
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.480]  it's really easy to explain it and you'll understand it if I use back crossing as an
[16:22.480 --> 16:23.480]  example.
[16:23.480 --> 16:27.520]  Let's talk quickly about what a back cross is and then I'll make sense of all of this.
[16:27.520 --> 16:28.800]  Let's just say I've got a plant.
[16:28.800 --> 16:31.280]  We'll say golden goat because I've done that.
[16:31.280 --> 16:34.240]  People want golden goat seeds, but I don't have a male golden goat plant.
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.200]  So you can't make regular golden goat seeds without making feminized seeds or without
[16:39.200 --> 16:42.680]  adulterating that golden goat plant in some sort of way.
[16:42.680 --> 16:47.120]  So what I would do, what I did is I pollinated the golden goat plant with another plant.
[16:47.120 --> 16:50.780]  Like I said before, a plant that was vastly different than the golden goat.
[16:50.780 --> 16:53.240]  This way I could identify the traits and the progeny.
[16:53.240 --> 16:55.540]  So I pollinated the golden goat with the daybreaker.
[16:55.540 --> 16:57.640]  And from that I could see those big leaf shapes.
[16:57.640 --> 16:59.360]  I could see those skinny leaf shapes.
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.880]  I knew right away that all of the skinny leaf shape plants were the golden goat phenotypes
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.920]  and the bigger leaf plants weren't even necessary to keep around for the back cross project
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.480]  because those were the daybreaker dominant phenotypes.
[17:12.480 --> 17:16.920]  So now if I want to make a back cross of this golden goat, my idea is to wash out all of
[17:16.920 --> 17:18.600]  those traits of that daybreaker.
[17:18.600 --> 17:20.360]  Now how do I wash that out?
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.320]  By simply breeding the golden goat to the golden goat multiple times.
[17:24.320 --> 17:29.440]  Now it's basically like adding more layers of paint until you can't see that daybreaker
[17:29.440 --> 17:30.680]  in there anymore.
[17:30.680 --> 17:33.760]  The way that I did that was I took the golden goat and the daybreaker.
[17:33.760 --> 17:34.760]  I made seeds.
[17:34.760 --> 17:39.080]  Now I've got my first cross, which is golden goat to daybreaker F1.
[17:39.080 --> 17:43.960]  From there I found a seedling, a male, that looked just exactly like the original golden
[17:43.960 --> 17:44.960]  goat.
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.640]  I took that male and I pollinated that original golden goat.
[17:48.640 --> 17:54.200]  Now I've taken that adulterated golden goat pollen, it's half golden goat, half daybreaker,
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.080]  and I've put it back on golden goat.
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.640]  Now I'm basically minimizing the ratio of amount of daybreaker traits in there.
[18:00.640 --> 18:04.440]  So that's going to make the golden goat back cross one.
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.420]  From there we grow out a batch of seeds and I'll find another male that looks exactly
[18:08.420 --> 18:13.200]  like the golden goat from that batch of seeds and I'll put that pollen back on the golden
[18:13.200 --> 18:15.960]  goat again and make yet another batch of seeds.
[18:15.960 --> 18:17.400]  Now do you see what I'm doing?
[18:17.400 --> 18:22.320]  Each time I add this golden goat to the mix, I'm just washing out traits of that daybreaker.
[18:22.320 --> 18:24.480]  We're just washing out those negative traits.
[18:24.480 --> 18:28.920]  So another thing to think in mind, another way to approach breeding is by thinking about
[18:29.160 --> 18:33.640]  what traits do you want to wash out and what traits do you want to bring along with you?
[18:33.640 --> 18:37.520]  Now I know I gave a lot of ratios, a lot of fractions and a lot of numbers.
[18:37.520 --> 18:39.280]  This is all good in theory.
[18:39.280 --> 18:42.720]  A lot of things to think about is this is all plant theory.
[18:42.720 --> 18:46.440]  If you write down these ideas, write this all down, it will look really good on paper,
[18:46.440 --> 18:48.920]  but we've got to keep in mind these are plants.
[18:48.920 --> 18:51.080]  They're going to do their own thing sometimes.
[18:51.080 --> 18:53.380]  Genetics will do their thing.
[18:53.380 --> 18:55.360]  You can do a aliel charts.
[18:55.360 --> 18:56.400]  You could write Mendel charts.
[18:56.400 --> 18:57.880]  You could do your predictions.
[18:57.880 --> 19:02.200]  We can do our favorite selections, but sometimes nature is just going to throw a curveball
[19:02.200 --> 19:03.200]  at you.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.280]  So this is kind of a guideline.
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.080]  This is kind of a quick course on how to stabilize and what stabilization means.
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.320]  But keep in mind when it comes to cannabis plants, there will always be variables because
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.800]  nature always finds a way.
[19:15.800 --> 19:16.800]  And guess what?
[19:16.800 --> 19:17.800]  Nature always wins.
[19:17.800 --> 19:18.800]  All right.
[19:18.800 --> 19:20.920]  That is my report on stabilization.
[19:20.920 --> 19:24.680]  I did say at the start of this podcast, I was going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.600]  Of course, that free seed giveaway is sponsored by my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[19:29.600 --> 19:32.560]  Big shout out to my friend James Bean at seedsherenow.com.
[19:32.560 --> 19:35.480]  Also big shout out to the entire crew at seedsherenow.com.
[19:35.480 --> 19:38.280]  I know none of that would happen without everybody on the team.
[19:38.280 --> 19:39.840]  It's a big crew they've got there.
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.080]  Big shout out to the whole team.
[19:41.080 --> 19:42.820]  Thank you for all of the support.
[19:42.820 --> 19:44.240]  Love working with those guys.
[19:44.240 --> 19:46.680]  Big fist bump to seedsherenow.com.
[19:46.680 --> 19:49.500]  Before I tell you how to win seeds on this episode, I do want to announce the winner
[19:49.500 --> 19:50.920]  of the last episode.
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.560]  However, the way that you won seeds on the last episode was by signing up for my newsletter.
[19:55.560 --> 19:59.560]  I have selected a winner, but I don't feel that it is fair to read your email address
[19:59.560 --> 20:03.040]  here on the podcast because I don't want you to get a bunch of spam.
[20:03.040 --> 20:06.640]  So if you won the free seed giveaway on the last episode, I have reached out to you via
[20:06.640 --> 20:07.880]  email.
[20:07.880 --> 20:09.480]  Please do respond to that email.
[20:09.480 --> 20:11.120]  Send me your shipping address.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.280]  Put a real name in that, please.
[20:12.280 --> 20:16.800]  If you win seeds, when you send me your address, please put a real name on there.
[20:16.800 --> 20:21.800]  I don't like putting Ganja Joe's Weed Farm on a package that I'm sending to somebody
[20:21.800 --> 20:23.360]  with seeds in it.
[20:23.360 --> 20:25.800]  First of all, that just looks shifty for the mailman.
[20:25.800 --> 20:28.240]  And then second of all, that encourages people to steal your shit.
[20:28.240 --> 20:30.440]  Plenty of people are stealing the mail.
[20:30.440 --> 20:36.860]  And if they see Joe's Weed Farm or Ganja Joe or Ganja Bob or Stone or Dave or whatever
[20:36.860 --> 20:38.960]  on the package, that does encourage theft.
[20:38.960 --> 20:43.680]  That just lets them know there might be something smokable or consumable in there or enjoyable
[20:43.680 --> 20:44.680]  in there.
[20:44.680 --> 20:45.680]  And that does encourage them to steal that.
[20:45.760 --> 20:49.120]  So don't get your seeds stolen that you won because that's a bummer.
[20:49.120 --> 20:50.400]  I don't want to have to send them to you again.
[20:50.400 --> 20:53.720]  So you will get an email if you won from the last seed giveaway.
[20:53.720 --> 20:56.840]  Of course, I've got your email address because you did sign up for the mailing list.
[20:56.840 --> 20:58.360]  I'm not going to do it that way this time.
[20:58.360 --> 21:01.120]  If you would like to win a free pack of seeds, it is very easy.
[21:01.120 --> 21:03.340]  All you've got to do is comment on this video.
[21:03.340 --> 21:07.880]  This is episode 789 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[21:07.880 --> 21:12.280]  If you're not watching on YouTube, I do encourage you to go to the YouTube video, leave a comment.
[21:12.280 --> 21:16.020]  Let me know why you think you should win a free pack of seeds.
[21:16.020 --> 21:18.320]  Also let me know which pack you would like to win.
[21:18.320 --> 21:21.680]  If I select you and I've got that pack of seeds, I'll do my best to give you that pack
[21:21.680 --> 21:22.960]  of seeds as your prize.
[21:22.960 --> 21:25.640]  However, keep in mind things do sell quite quickly.
[21:25.640 --> 21:27.480]  Not everything is in stock and available.
[21:27.480 --> 21:29.520]  So make your wishes, don't make demands.
[21:29.520 --> 21:31.560]  I'll do my best to fill that.
[21:31.560 --> 21:32.560]  So it's very simple.
[21:32.560 --> 21:34.320]  All you've got to do is go to the YouTube video.
[21:34.320 --> 21:38.820]  This is episode once again, I said 789 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[21:38.820 --> 21:40.320]  Leave a comment on the video.
[21:40.320 --> 21:44.780]  Let me know why you should win a free pack of seeds and also let me know what strain
[21:44.780 --> 21:46.040]  you would like to win.
[21:46.040 --> 21:49.320]  And once again, if you won from the last episode, you did receive an email.
[21:49.320 --> 21:50.440]  So check your email.
[21:50.440 --> 21:52.200]  You might have that sitting in your inbox.
[21:52.200 --> 21:54.280]  Also check your spam because you never know.
[21:54.280 --> 21:55.800]  All right, I'm getting rambly.
[21:55.800 --> 21:57.200]  It is time to wrap up this episode.
[21:57.200 --> 22:01.640]  Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
[22:01.640 --> 22:04.680]  pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there.
