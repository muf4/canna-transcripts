[00:11.450 --> 00:22.620]  Yeah, what's up cannabis community? It's time for episode number 84 of the Grow From Your
[00:22.620 --> 00:28.500]  Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:28.500 --> 00:31.740]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[00:31.740 --> 00:35.260]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:35.260 --> 00:39.460]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, Ross the Jeff.
[00:39.460 --> 00:42.820]  Thanks again for joining me. As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to
[00:42.820 --> 00:46.180]  the mystic roots band. They let me use their music on the show and I really appreciate
[00:46.180 --> 00:50.900]  it. Big thanks to Kat Coot and the entire mystic roots crew. Hope everyone's having
[00:50.900 --> 00:54.420]  a great day. Sitting across the table for me today is our good buddy, white Mike. How
[00:54.420 --> 00:58.340]  you doing brother? Doing good, man. How are you doing? I am doing great. Had a quick day
[00:58.340 --> 01:02.180]  at work, had some time to record. I thought I'd have you come over and throw down a podcast
[01:02.180 --> 01:06.380]  before you go do your activism stuff you do. Right. We've got just enough time to get an
[01:06.380 --> 01:10.340]  episode in. Yes, we sure do. We got to get it out kind of quickly, but we'll get it going.
[01:10.340 --> 01:14.420]  Kind of get to the point here. Mike's here. We're going to do some news. Doing some news.
[01:14.420 --> 01:19.300]  Doing some news stuff. Before we get too far, I do have to do one quick ad. This podcast is
[01:19.300 --> 01:23.140]  brought to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations
[01:23.140 --> 01:28.660]  in Colorado. They have a Denver location. It is 6271 Beach Street, or you can go to my favorite
[01:28.660 --> 01:34.500]  store. It's the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. Check out
[01:34.500 --> 01:38.340]  Hygro. They do have great pricing. They've got a great selection of indoor growing supplies.
[01:38.340 --> 01:42.580]  You can get your favorite nutrients at Hygro. Also, when you are checking out, make sure you
[01:42.580 --> 01:46.340]  let them know that you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast. They will give you commercial
[01:46.340 --> 01:51.700]  pricing on your entire purchase. That'll save you a lot of money. Love that commercial pricing.
[01:51.700 --> 01:55.220]  Oh, it's such a fat hookup. It's actually a better hookup than what the employees pay,
[01:55.220 --> 01:59.540]  or what the employees, yeah, what they pay on products. They have been trying to use my coupon
[01:59.540 --> 02:04.500]  code. All right. I love it. Big shout out to Hygro for making the show possible. They really
[02:04.500 --> 02:08.980]  help me out every month. Also, before I go too far and it leaves my mind, I want to give a huge
[02:08.980 --> 02:14.500]  shout out to a guy by the name of Brian Meyer. I'm not sure if it's Meyer or Meyer, but Brian,
[02:14.500 --> 02:19.380]  big shout out, much appreciation. Brian hit that PayPal donation button and threw a few bucks at
[02:19.380 --> 02:24.500]  the podcast. That'll help us with some upgrades. I'm working on getting a portable recording device.
[02:24.500 --> 02:29.460]  I want the Zune H6 so that I could take the show on the road a little bit more. My recording gear
[02:29.460 --> 02:34.020]  that I have now is bulky. A little cumbersome. Yes, but the device I'm looking at will be able
[02:34.020 --> 02:38.580]  to go to any event. We'll be able to go anywhere on the fly. I'll keep it in my backpack. We'll
[02:38.580 --> 02:44.020]  have podcasts coming from all kinds of crazy places. Those donations help a lot. That will
[02:44.020 --> 02:48.820]  work out in the very near future, hopefully. If anybody out there wants to sponsor the podcast,
[02:48.820 --> 02:51.540]  just send me an email. It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com. We'll get you all the
[02:51.540 --> 02:57.380]  information you need. We can get your product advertised to a target audience of about 5,000
[02:57.380 --> 03:01.780]  people per week, plus all the people that go back and listen to the cataloged episodes.
[03:01.860 --> 03:06.900]  It's a really good idea to advertise with a cannabis-related podcast. I think that's all
[03:06.900 --> 03:13.780]  the advertising I've got. I've got some news articles here. The current news Mike informed me
[03:13.780 --> 03:20.420]  of, today was the day that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment actually decided
[03:20.420 --> 03:28.740]  to deny PTSD as a qualifying condition for medically recommended cannabis in the state of
[03:28.740 --> 03:35.380]  Colorado. In Colorado, there are eight qualifying conditions and all eight of them were passed by
[03:35.380 --> 03:42.740]  the law back in 2000. The CDPHE hasn't added a single qualifying condition in all that time.
[03:42.740 --> 03:48.580]  This is the third time they've denied PTSD. I think PTSD is definitely a qualifying condition.
[03:50.020 --> 03:55.060]  It's bullshit that they're not allowing that. It definitely should be. In our days working
[03:55.060 --> 04:00.820]  the counter, how many people came in specifically saying, I've got PTSD, marijuana helps so much.
[04:00.820 --> 04:05.620]  I love that you guys are here. Absolutely. Is the Colorado Department of Public Health and
[04:05.620 --> 04:09.700]  Environment basically giving their finger to veterans and telling veterans to go drink alcohol
[04:09.700 --> 04:16.420]  instead of consuming cannabis to help themselves? That's basically been the effect of their policy
[04:16.420 --> 04:21.700]  for the last decade or so. Guys, what they were trying to do is people that have PTSD,
[04:21.700 --> 04:25.460]  they were trying to get that as a qualifying condition to get your medical marijuana
[04:25.460 --> 04:30.500]  recommendation from the doctor here in the state of Colorado. It has been denied three times now.
[04:31.060 --> 04:39.300]  We cannot get post-traumatic stress disorder as a condition that is qualified that could be treated
[04:39.300 --> 04:45.140]  with medical marijuana. It's not just vets. There's a lot of people out in the community that
[04:45.140 --> 04:53.060]  have PTSD and marijuana helps a lot of them. Now they can't sit down and talk to their doctor about
[04:53.060 --> 04:57.620]  using cannabis directly for that. If they wanted to join the medical program, they'd have to have
[04:57.620 --> 05:02.740]  one of the other eight qualifying conditions. Or at least here, they can still visit the rec market
[05:02.740 --> 05:07.700]  and just pay a lot more than they would in our medical. Which doesn't allow them to grow the
[05:07.700 --> 05:11.780]  product that they need. That's a big part of having your medical marijuana card is being
[05:11.780 --> 05:16.420]  able to grow or being able to assign a caregiver to grow for you. That's a big part of it.
[05:16.420 --> 05:19.380]  Mike Santos, MD, PhD Right. Trying to do three plants in your backyard or
[05:19.940 --> 05:24.980]  if that's allowed in your area and whatnot, it's just brutal difficult already. If you're already
[05:24.980 --> 05:29.780]  suffering PTSD, now you've got to protect yourself from all the paranoia that comes
[05:29.780 --> 05:33.620]  with growing marijuana for the first time. Mike Santos, MD, PhD I think a large portion
[05:33.620 --> 05:39.380]  of the population has some form of post-traumatic stress disorder, whether it be childhood trauma,
[05:39.700 --> 05:43.700]  you can see something very little when you're a child. You're a psychology kid,
[05:43.700 --> 05:47.540]  a psychology student, something really little when you're a kid can really fuck you up permanently if
[05:47.540 --> 05:51.940]  you don't take it right. Mike Santos, MD, PhD There was a study looking at kids in some of the
[05:51.940 --> 05:57.460]  rougher parts of Chicago and it was like 80% of the kids exhibited some symptoms of PTSD.
[05:58.340 --> 06:03.060]  A lot of people have started calling it just they've dropped the D. It's no longer a disorder,
[06:03.060 --> 06:09.700]  it's just post-traumatic stress. It's what the human body and brain does after a seriously
[06:09.700 --> 06:16.100]  traumatic incident sometimes. A lot of people coming home from war or that have witnessed
[06:16.100 --> 06:20.260]  domestic violence or been victim of domestic violence or have seen car crashes. Mike Santos,
[06:20.260 --> 06:24.420]  MD, PhD I've seen somebody die in a car crash and it's in the back of my mind every time we're on
[06:24.420 --> 06:27.860]  the highway. I always get a little flashback of that. Mike Santos, MD, PhD I don't like U-turns
[06:27.860 --> 06:30.660]  for the same reason. Mike Santos, MD, PhD Yeah, you've told me that amazing story there.
[06:31.620 --> 06:36.740]  So what I was headed for is I was going to imply that I don't know what event it is,
[06:36.740 --> 06:41.540]  but I know there's some sort of post-traumatic stress in my mind from my life. That's why I
[06:41.540 --> 06:44.820]  said everybody's probably got it because I don't have a significant event that I can recall,
[06:45.380 --> 06:50.980]  but I've seen some shit. I know that when I feel, even if you've got stress of the day,
[06:50.980 --> 06:55.380]  when you smoke, it distracts you and it calms that part of your brain down and it allows you
[06:56.580 --> 07:00.420]  to not obsess on that thought and it lets you break free of that a little bit.
[07:00.500 --> 07:05.860]  The big thing, a lot of the people that I know that were treating their PTSD with cannabis would
[07:05.860 --> 07:11.460]  talk about is the dreamless sleep. That was the big benefit that they'd talk about, at least when
[07:11.460 --> 07:18.020]  they were in the shop. So it would stop their dreams. Yep. I mean, I barely dream and I attribute
[07:18.020 --> 07:23.300]  that to cannabis use because when I don't smoke, I have very vivid dreams just regularly. That's
[07:23.300 --> 07:28.180]  odd because people have asked me what I like to smoke and I say I like to smoke a heavy,
[07:28.420 --> 07:33.940]  sativa right before bed because it makes my mind do that wandering thing. And so I close my eyes
[07:33.940 --> 07:37.860]  and I feel like I just dream instantly because I'm already right there at that state. You know
[07:37.860 --> 07:41.780]  what I mean? Cause you smoke that really high head, high sativa and I just close my eyes and
[07:41.780 --> 07:45.380]  then my dreams are claymation and they just happened as soon as my eyes close. And then I
[07:45.380 --> 07:50.260]  sleep really well on a heavy sativa and I have huge dreams from it. So that's kind of strange
[07:50.260 --> 07:53.780]  that it stops other people's dreams, which I'm not going to argue that if it's working for them,
[07:53.780 --> 07:58.740]  that's amazing. Do that. Well, I asked you one day, like you still dream bro. And you looked at
[07:58.740 --> 08:04.740]  me like offended. Like, of course, why would not have amazing dreams? Yeah. I, I just assumed that
[08:04.740 --> 08:09.620]  the effect was something you got to, cause you consume way more than me. Sometimes I can control
[08:09.620 --> 08:14.580]  my dreams a little bit, but if I get too carried away, I wake myself up. But so I know I'm like,
[08:14.580 --> 08:19.060]  eh, don't influence this dream too much, but also kind of guided a little like, but if I,
[08:19.060 --> 08:23.060]  if I push too hard, I wake myself up out of the dream. No, I haven't had a dream in like eight
[08:23.060 --> 08:28.260]  years. It's beautiful. Oh man. I dream constantly. Uh, I wake up talking, oh shit. Or something like
[08:28.260 --> 08:33.700]  that out of a dream. Right? Yeah. It's funny. All right. So, uh, if you guys are working on getting
[08:33.700 --> 08:38.580]  medical marijuana in your area, in your state, please, while you're writing the bills, while
[08:38.580 --> 08:43.060]  you're writing the rules, please put in some sort of a clause that includes post-traumatic stress
[08:43.060 --> 08:47.540]  disorder. It's not something that you can see, but it is something that definitely exists.
[08:47.540 --> 08:51.460]  Uh, we need it for our veterans more than anything, but it's also for everybody.
[08:51.460 --> 08:56.420]  Let's be fair out there. You guys, not all medical conditions are visible. That's something
[08:56.420 --> 09:01.220]  you got to keep in mind, right? The bill. Well, we, uh, we here in Colorado, I'll assume that the
[09:01.220 --> 09:06.500]  CDP AG would be willing to add other conditions to the list of currently accepted conditions
[09:07.060 --> 09:11.940]  over time, but there's been countless applications at this point. I can't remember how many, but it's
[09:11.940 --> 09:17.780]  like 15 or 20. Wow. Um, PTSD has been up three times and they've denied everything just flat
[09:17.780 --> 09:22.820]  out. Nope, not at this time. There's not enough research showing that there is, you know, a
[09:22.820 --> 09:27.620]  general effect and there isn't research done because it's not allowed yet. Not enough research.
[09:27.620 --> 09:32.820]  Unless you're looking for harm, you can't do the research until very, very, like within the last
[09:32.820 --> 09:39.300]  few months recently. So these studies are being drawn up now that will be conducted in the next
[09:39.300 --> 09:45.540]  year or seven. The, you know, findings will be out and become public knowledge 10 years from then.
[09:46.100 --> 09:50.580]  Like, and we're just going to keep letting people suffer or, I mean, at least in Colorado,
[09:50.580 --> 09:55.620]  they can use the rec market or, um, I mean, it's not like the black market ever want to
[09:55.620 --> 09:59.700]  weigh here. It has had to step up its game considerably to continue to compete, but
[10:00.900 --> 10:06.180]  yeah, the black market will never go away. And then once the vet has the bud here in Colorado,
[10:06.180 --> 10:13.380]  it's illegal again. So, all right. So it's no good here, but we didn't take a step forward
[10:13.380 --> 10:17.620]  today and that sucks. That's yeah. We stayed, we stumbled over our own dicks once again.
[10:17.620 --> 10:21.540]  So make sure you guys include the PTSD when you write your new medical marijuana bill. That's my
[10:21.540 --> 10:26.020]  main point here. And, um, the next time it comes up that we're trying to vote on this, make sure
[10:26.020 --> 10:30.420]  you support it because I fully think that PTSD is a qualifying condition. Get registered to vote.
[10:30.420 --> 10:35.700]  Marijuana will be on your ballot in the next two years. Yes, it will. Yes, it will. If it's not on
[10:35.700 --> 10:41.700]  the ballot in 2015 vote anyway, and just practice that shit. There you go. Be ready for 2016.
[10:41.700 --> 10:48.180]  Cause it will then. So we talked a little bit in the last episode about, uh, the desire for
[10:48.180 --> 10:54.740]  Denver voters, uh, to want, uh, consumption in some establishments where people are over 21 and
[10:54.740 --> 11:02.020]  they're not smoking inside. Um, on where's the date. Okay. It was July 9th. The cannabis posted
[11:02.020 --> 11:08.260]  an update to that article and it says Denver voters favor limited pot use in bars. It says
[11:08.260 --> 11:13.220]  Denver marijuana poll and majority of voters in the city support an initiative that would allow
[11:13.220 --> 11:19.860]  limited pot use, uh, no indoor smoking at businesses, uh, over 21 businesses such as bars.
[11:20.900 --> 11:25.300]  So it's been voted on. This article was written by Ricardo Baca from the cannabis staff. I may
[11:25.300 --> 11:29.620]  skip part of it because we just need to get to the point here, but it says a majority of Denver
[11:29.620 --> 11:34.260]  voters support an initiative that would allow limited social marijuana consumption in businesses
[11:34.260 --> 11:38.500]  such as bars. According to a poll commissioned by the group behind the proposal, the cannabis
[11:38.500 --> 11:41.220]  has learned exclusively. I kind of read that weird, but I think you got it.
[11:41.780 --> 11:47.060]  Yeah. The people that wrote up the bill, uh, paid for a poll and the poll says voters are
[11:47.060 --> 11:53.060]  going to support it. So fingers crossed. I mean, their, their poll doesn't, if you're, you you're
[11:53.060 --> 11:59.700]  really into politics, their poll says that voters support it by 56%. If they add in the people that
[11:59.700 --> 12:03.700]  are totally not going to fucking vote because they don't really give a shit. They're just like,
[12:03.700 --> 12:06.980]  sure, whatever. I would support that, but I'm not going to go support that.
[12:06.980 --> 12:15.300]  I would, but there's television on that night. So, but, um, it, I don't, I hope it passes in
[12:15.300 --> 12:21.220]  2015. The need for this is huge. It's huge. But the poll data does not look favorable right now.
[12:21.220 --> 12:25.620]  If more of us don't get politically active. True. Well, that actually says the poll results
[12:25.620 --> 12:32.740]  say only 56%, uh, of likely Denver voters either strongly support or somewhat support the initiative
[12:32.740 --> 12:39.780]  according to the democratic firm, public policy polling. Uh, so 56% isn't a bold number. That's
[12:39.780 --> 12:43.940]  no, that's 6% away from losing. Yeah. And when you really look at the polling data,
[12:43.940 --> 12:50.260]  it's something like 30% are like gung ho about it in 26%. Don't give a shit.
[12:50.260 --> 12:55.780]  Uh, it says here, uh, for those against the initiative, 31% strongly opposed and 9%
[12:55.780 --> 13:00.740]  somewhat opposed it while 5% said they weren't sure. Right. Uh, it was an automated telephone
[13:00.740 --> 13:06.100]  poll and it's got a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points. So this was just a telephone
[13:06.100 --> 13:09.380]  poll. People on the telephone will say that they will do anything because all they got to do is
[13:09.380 --> 13:14.020]  sit there and press one for yes and two for no and three for English. Right. And that's all they had
[13:14.020 --> 13:19.220]  to worry about. So yeah, a lot of these people probably won't come out and vote. So the pollsters
[13:19.220 --> 13:22.820]  asked whether voters would support allowing the consumption of marijuana at private venues in
[13:22.820 --> 13:27.620]  Denver provided that the owner of the venue permits the consumption access to the venue is limited to
[13:27.620 --> 13:32.980]  individuals 21 years of age of older and smoking marijuana indoors is prohibited and any outdoor
[13:32.980 --> 13:39.060]  uses hidden from public view, which that that's all fair. That makes sense. It's really not that,
[13:39.060 --> 13:46.580]  it's that of a bill and it's fairly, sorry guys, dabs and soda. Yep. I agree. Um, it's a pretty
[13:46.580 --> 13:52.900]  fair bill. Uh, you gotta be outside and it's gotta be 25 feet from wherever public gather.
[13:52.900 --> 13:59.300]  So what I'm envisioning is a shitload of roof deck, um, type establishments in Denver where
[13:59.300 --> 14:03.460]  they just, uh, there's a couple of bars that were already doing this. And if you felt like being
[14:03.460 --> 14:10.020]  outside, you couldn't smoke up there, tobacco or usually the, um, the last time I was up there,
[14:10.020 --> 14:14.980]  but, uh, now they're going to allow marijuana up there or at least 25 feet away from the public.
[14:14.980 --> 14:19.700]  So like in a little back courtyard, that's all fenced off. Yeah. There are several like Cervantes,
[14:20.260 --> 14:25.940]  other side in Denver has got the perfect little area for smoking. That would be sweet. Um, what's
[14:25.940 --> 14:29.380]  that other place where we go to that? There are a lot of clubs up there that have nice little
[14:29.380 --> 14:34.340]  outdoor areas. It would be beautiful to smoke in which to smoke. Yeah. So just let us do it.
[14:34.340 --> 14:37.940]  Uh, they say that they're gathering 5,000 signatures to get the question on Denver's
[14:37.940 --> 14:42.340]  November ballot. Uh, another one of the poll findings that Denver residents by a four to one
[14:42.340 --> 14:47.540]  ratio believe that alcohol causes more problems in the city than marijuana and also favors their
[14:47.540 --> 14:51.780]  side of the contentious issue. Uh, Denver voters have made it quite clear that they support
[14:51.780 --> 14:56.660]  treating marijuana like alcohol said Mason to vert a national pot activist. And one of the primary
[14:56.660 --> 15:01.940]  authors behind Colorado's original cannabis legalizing amendment 64, uh, he says voters
[15:01.940 --> 15:08.660]  approved measures to measures, to the effect in 2000, what measures to the effect in 2005, 2006,
[15:08.660 --> 15:14.180]  2007, and 2012. And so it's not surprising that we're still seeing such strong support,
[15:14.180 --> 15:19.940]  even among a more conservative voting population in an off year election. So people are supporting
[15:19.940 --> 15:24.820]  it more surprisingly than we had anticipated. Yeah. Even a poll, this goods, a little surprising
[15:24.820 --> 15:29.380]  to people who follow this stuff. So I, I mean, I wish them the best of luck. If I lived in Denver,
[15:29.380 --> 15:34.820]  they'd have my vote. Uh, it says in the question that asked respondents, if alcohol or marijuana
[15:34.820 --> 15:42.660]  caused more problems in Denver, 55% said alcohol, 13% said marijuana, 26% said both and 6% were not
[15:42.660 --> 15:48.820]  sure. So we're making it obvious here that alcohol is the problem and cannabis is the peaceful way to
[15:48.820 --> 15:53.700]  gather and celebrate and have a good time and relax. Uh, the last paragraph of the article says,
[15:54.820 --> 15:59.460]  uh, by more than four to one margin in Denver voters site alcohol over marijuana as a bigger
[15:59.460 --> 16:04.180]  source of problems in the city said to vert anyone who has spent time in the Loto on a weekend
[16:04.180 --> 16:08.980]  evening or walk down Colfax Avenue on any given day knows that alcohol contributes to far more
[16:09.060 --> 16:14.420]  problems and far more severe problems than marijuana. He said, which if you go out on
[16:14.420 --> 16:19.540]  almost any major city, any big city on the weekends, uh, you, if you go to the bar,
[16:19.540 --> 16:23.860]  where's that every downtown's got that one area where there's a nice congregation of bars
[16:23.860 --> 16:29.060]  and everybody goes there and about one o'clock on Friday night out of one of the bars erupts a big
[16:29.060 --> 16:33.940]  ass fight and half of the bar spills out and they all push the shit out of each other. And then the
[16:33.940 --> 16:38.740]  cops come and a few people get arrested and then you hear about it Saturday. Um, that doesn't
[16:38.740 --> 16:43.060]  happen at weed events. And if it does, we, we shun those people from the community and they don't
[16:43.060 --> 16:49.700]  come back. Right. Cannabis is a peaceful drug. Like alcohol is the problem for sure. So I think
[16:49.700 --> 16:55.540]  if they, uh, shoot, if they let us smoke at clubs and stuff, I would go, I don't go to places cause
[16:55.540 --> 16:59.460]  I don't drink alcohol and there's no reason for me to be there. But if I could go take a few dads,
[16:59.460 --> 17:04.180]  I'd be more likely to go to the shows at the local venues because even though it's not my
[17:04.180 --> 17:08.340]  kind of music, I would go be social if I could go dab out and have fun there. Right. We're not
[17:08.340 --> 17:13.060]  antisocial. We're just sick of explaining that we don't drink. Yeah, I don't, I do not want a beer,
[17:13.060 --> 17:16.340]  but thank you. And no, it's not because I'm better than you. It's because I don't want to
[17:16.340 --> 17:20.820]  be an asshole. I'm a drunken asshole when I drink. Right. I wasn't an asshole. I just don't want the
[17:20.820 --> 17:26.180]  hangover anymore. Oh yeah. Dude, the hangover is terrible. Yeah. I haven't had a hangover in 10
[17:26.180 --> 17:30.260]  years. That's so great. All right. So when it comes time to vote, you guys, I want everybody
[17:30.260 --> 17:34.420]  that listens to this show that lives in the three Oh three and the seven two Oh, I want you guys all
[17:34.420 --> 17:39.460]  to go. Was that right? You got those right. He looked at me like I was correct. I want you guys
[17:39.460 --> 17:45.940]  to go. All of you have to go vote. Do legalize consumption in adult places. Please do that.
[17:47.380 --> 17:51.780]  You're starting at the dabs, bro. I just noticed the Turpex. Well, since you're looking at the
[17:51.780 --> 17:56.580]  Turpex container, I've got a star that says dab review. Uh, the other day I went up to Colorado
[17:56.580 --> 18:01.060]  Springs and I visited my friends. Uh, I visited the lovely damsel. Hello damsel. I hope you're
[18:01.060 --> 18:07.860]  listening. I also visited my good buddy hunt and I saw Jordan and I saw the turpy boys and I also
[18:07.860 --> 18:13.940]  saw John Randall's junior and we all had a good time. And I took Danielle with me and we went up
[18:13.940 --> 18:21.220]  to the shop and I picked up some Turpex sour Durban sativa. And I got to say, bro, it is sativa
[18:21.220 --> 18:25.460]  as a mofo. I get super dabbed out when I smoke the shit. You're looking at me like, well, let's
[18:25.460 --> 18:30.580]  get a dab of it. Let me see the container. But herein lies the problem. This shit was so good.
[18:31.700 --> 18:38.180]  It only lasted a day. It lasted one day. That shit was awesome. I really approved of it. So
[18:38.180 --> 18:42.260]  if you guys can get your hands on the sour Durban at green and healthy can of green and healthy
[18:42.260 --> 18:47.300]  wellness in Colorado Springs, uh, from Turpex, I would definitely recommend that. Turpex is doing
[18:47.300 --> 18:51.620]  some amazing things down here. Shout out to the Turpex crew. They gave me a, they hooked me up
[18:51.620 --> 18:57.780]  with a white and a black extra, extra large Turpex t-shirt. So I'm now styled out in Turpex. I'm
[18:57.780 --> 19:02.180]  smoking it. I'm wearing it. I'm repping it hard. I like it. Let me get a dab for myself and then
[19:02.180 --> 19:06.820]  I'll get a dab for you. I know you like these little tiny dabs, tiny dabs. I've got stuff to
[19:06.820 --> 19:12.100]  do tonight. Gotta be all right. Here's the dab for Mike. And while Mike takes that dab, I'm going to
[19:12.100 --> 19:16.420]  move ourselves into the next article here and we will read some news.
[19:16.420 --> 19:18.420]  I'm going to kill my mic while I choke. Where's your buddy?
[19:18.420 --> 19:22.500]  All right. I got you. Mike is muted. Oh, you hear all that echo that cuts out. It's beautiful.
[19:23.220 --> 19:28.900]  All right. So we are reaching how much time are we in? All right. We're 20 minutes in. We're going
[19:28.900 --> 19:33.380]  to make this a little bit of a longer episode. Uh, the article says this is also from the
[19:33.380 --> 19:39.620]  cannabis and it was written by Jean Johnson of the associated press. The headline is one year in
[19:39.700 --> 19:45.860]  $70 million in pot taxes and other lessons from Washington. On the sub headline, we get a headline
[19:45.860 --> 19:49.620]  and a sub headline now in articles. That's great. The internet is fucking up our heads.
[19:49.620 --> 19:54.900]  I was 250 million in marijuana sales. Washington still has room to grow as its ninth largest
[19:54.900 --> 20:00.820]  grower says. It's amazing. We could be so successful and unsuccessful at the same time.
[20:00.820 --> 20:05.540]  The article goes on to say Washington launched its second in the nation legal marijuana market
[20:05.540 --> 20:10.100]  with just a handful of stores selling high price pot to long lines of customers. A year later,
[20:10.100 --> 20:15.940]  the state has about 160 shops open pot tax revenues have soared past expectations and sales
[20:15.940 --> 20:24.260]  top $1.4 million per day. They're making $1.4 million per day on cannabis in Washington right
[20:24.260 --> 20:29.140]  now. And it also goes on to say, and who knows the industry might even start making some money.
[20:29.700 --> 20:34.260]  Washington pot farmers, processors, and retailers have complained all year that heavy state and
[20:34.260 --> 20:38.500]  federal tax burdens along with competition from an unregulated medical marijuana market have made
[20:38.500 --> 20:43.860]  it difficult for them to do business. But at least some relief is there as here this month,
[20:44.420 --> 20:49.380]  two new laws take effect. One to regulate and tax medical marijuana and one to cut Washington's
[20:49.380 --> 20:55.780]  three level excise pot tax to a single 37% tax. That's higher than Colorado tax.
[20:55.780 --> 21:02.580]  Yeah. That's the big lesson between Washington and Colorado is that the free market applies.
[21:04.420 --> 21:10.020]  We see it in Colorado. There are a lot of people that are, that have been smoking marijuana here
[21:10.020 --> 21:16.420]  for 40, 50 years. And the only time they visit the stores is for novelty, right? For the occasional
[21:16.420 --> 21:22.260]  selection. For the most part, they're still buying marijuana where they used to because it's half the
[21:22.260 --> 21:30.500]  price. Yes, it is. In Washington, the taxes are so bad that almost none of the locals are interested
[21:31.060 --> 21:36.660]  because they're taxing it. It's like 75% or it's like 25% three different times.
[21:37.300 --> 21:42.100]  And so by the time it gets to the consumer, it grams like 60 bucks in what the fuck.
[21:42.100 --> 21:46.100]  Yeah. Who's going to pay that when you can just go to the dude on the corner and get it for 12 or
[21:46.100 --> 21:51.620]  15. Right. Yeah. Okay. So the article goes on to say, despite some industry gripes and those tweaks
[21:51.620 --> 21:58.420]  to Washington's legal pot law, marijuana, which a marijuana law, which voters passed in 2012 to
[21:58.420 --> 22:03.060]  legalize marijuana for adults over 21 officials and legalization backers say the state's slow
[22:03.060 --> 22:07.780]  and deliberate effort to regulate marijuana has been a success. A year after stores opened on
[22:07.780 --> 22:14.180]  July 8th, 2014. Here's a look at the state of legal weed here. It says the taxes, uh, Washington
[22:14.180 --> 22:19.700]  racked up more than $250 million in marijuana sales in the past year, roughly $62 million of
[22:19.700 --> 22:25.860]  which constitute marijuana excise taxes. That's beyond the state's original forecast of 36 million.
[22:25.860 --> 22:29.940]  And when the state and local sales and other shops, other taxes are included,
[22:29.940 --> 22:33.780]  the total payday for the state and local government tops $70 million.
[22:34.740 --> 22:40.740]  Okay. So the interesting number there is the 60 million excise tax in Colorado.
[22:41.460 --> 22:46.180]  Uh, the excise tax is what's supposed to pay that $40 million for schools.
[22:46.900 --> 22:52.020]  And we've already crushed in the first five months of this year, last year's whole year total.
[22:52.020 --> 22:55.700]  Nice. Um, because the standalone production markets only just now
[22:55.700 --> 23:02.100]  coming online, all the shops had to produce their own for the longest time here. And so that was the
[23:02.100 --> 23:08.580]  infrastructure we started with. And because of that, that excise tax was real small here in
[23:08.580 --> 23:14.100]  Colorado. And that's the huge difference between our taxes and their taxes is by the time it gets
[23:14.100 --> 23:20.420]  to the shelf, that excise tax is nuts. Yes. Only 10 million of theirs was in sales tax. We collected
[23:20.980 --> 23:30.100]  60 or 40 or something like that. And then just sales tax. I hope when the nationwide legalization
[23:30.100 --> 23:34.580]  happens, I hope all these crazy taxes are done away with or adjusted somehow. Right. It's going
[23:34.580 --> 23:39.060]  to, it's going to have to come back down to reality or they won't matter so much because
[23:39.060 --> 23:46.660]  they're charging you 36% tax on a $2 gram, um, which is entirely feasible, which, uh, from,
[23:46.740 --> 23:51.780]  um, there may, they're growing a lot of cannabis right now. And in Washington, they may grow
[23:51.780 --> 23:57.380]  more than they're able to sell is something that I see possibly happening. So that really could
[23:57.380 --> 24:02.020]  happen. It could go really dirty cheap pretty soon here. All right. I want to see how long
[24:02.020 --> 24:04.980]  we've been recording and we might, yeah, we're going to read the rest of this article and then
[24:04.980 --> 24:09.780]  we're going to save the, um, yeah, I got one more article we'll get into. So the next sub headline
[24:09.780 --> 24:13.940]  in this article says, isn't legal weed expensive in Washington? And it goes on to say a few growers
[24:13.940 --> 24:19.540]  harvesting, uh, uh, by the first time, sorry, let me read it again because it's moving. There we go
[24:19.540 --> 24:23.540]  with the few growers harvesting. By the time the first door just opened the average price of a
[24:23.540 --> 24:29.300]  gram of legal marijuana spark spikes to nearly $30 last summer, about three times the cost in medical
[24:29.300 --> 24:34.100]  marijuana shops where prices have been dropping as more weed gets harvested. In fact, Washington
[24:34.100 --> 24:40.020]  has harvested 13.5 tons of marijuana flower intended to be sold as bud, but stores have
[24:40.020 --> 24:45.540]  only sold about 10 tons. Some of the excess can be turned into marijuana extracts such as oil,
[24:45.540 --> 24:51.300]  but the harvest has helped drive down the prices to an average of about 1150 per gram. So I was a
[24:51.300 --> 24:55.300]  little bit right about that. They grew too much and it's getting cheaper. Nevertheless, that in
[24:55.300 --> 24:59.300]  addition to tourists eager to visit the city's historic first legal pot shop, his clientele
[24:59.300 --> 25:05.220]  primarily consists of customers in the 25 and older range. It's more of an adult demographic,
[25:05.220 --> 25:08.980]  but that's okay. He says they have jobs and they can afford to buy the product.
[25:09.700 --> 25:13.860]  Uh, the next headline says, so what's next? Rick Garza, director of Washington's liquor board,
[25:13.860 --> 25:18.340]  a liquor control board soon to be renamed the liquor and cannabis board says he's proud of
[25:18.340 --> 25:23.140]  Washington's efforts at a meeting, the top, uh, at meeting the top priorities, the justice
[25:23.140 --> 25:26.820]  department laid out when it announced it would allow Washington, Colorado and other States to
[25:26.820 --> 25:31.460]  regulate marijuana, keeping criminal organizations out of the industry, keeping the marijuana in
[25:31.460 --> 25:36.500]  state and keeping pot away from the kids. Uh, it goes on to say the state adopted background
[25:36.500 --> 25:40.660]  checks and financial investigations of pot license applicants and cap the total amount
[25:40.660 --> 25:45.300]  of production to try to keep it in line with in-state demand. While public health advocates
[25:45.300 --> 25:49.700]  say they wish the state had done more to stress the potential harms of pot to teens. The state
[25:49.700 --> 25:53.780]  required strict packaging and labeling requirements to keep children from getting into the weed.
[25:53.780 --> 25:56.420]  They did the same thing here. We kind of set a little standard here. I think
[25:57.380 --> 26:02.500]  the products that appeal to kids also remain banned. No marijuana, cotton candy, or gummy
[26:02.500 --> 26:07.460]  bears. Uh, so Claude, you can't get the sweet stone bears up there. That's terrible. I'm sorry, bro.
[26:07.460 --> 26:13.780]  Yeah. Everything here sold in the childproof packaging. So even the candy bars come in a pill
[26:13.780 --> 26:20.980]  bottle, right? Essentially. So it's not like they look like what your kids eat or it can be confused
[26:20.980 --> 26:25.780]  easily. Yeah. And they're well labeled. They're well labeled. So the article wraps up to say,
[26:25.780 --> 26:29.140]  this isn't the first time people have gone to Oregon to buy something either because it's cheaper
[26:29.140 --> 26:34.740]  or because they don't apply sales tax. He said, we saw it for liquor and we see it for tobacco.
[26:34.740 --> 26:39.620]  So they're making a ton of money in Washington and they may have grown too much cannabis,
[26:39.620 --> 26:43.220]  which is fine because they're pushing down the prices. Right? All right. I'm going to do this
[26:43.220 --> 26:47.620]  one more article. This is also from Washington. I know guys, I'm in Colorado, but I like to share
[26:47.620 --> 26:52.260]  the news from all over the place. This one says Washington cracking down on unlicensed medical
[26:52.260 --> 26:56.580]  marijuana stores. We don't even have to read the whole article here because that headline says it
[26:56.580 --> 27:01.780]  all. This article is by Martha Belisle from the Associated Press. And I hope I said your last name
[27:01.780 --> 27:07.780]  right. It said 15 unlicensed medical marijuana shops in unincorporated King County are on notice
[27:07.780 --> 27:12.820]  that they are violating the law. King County prosecutor, Dan Sederberg and Sheriff John
[27:12.820 --> 27:16.900]  something said Wednesday that they were cracking down on these stores after Washington lawmakers
[27:16.900 --> 27:22.260]  amended initiative 502 to require licenses for all pot shops. The change in the law brought
[27:22.260 --> 27:28.340]  medical marijuana into the state licensing and tax scheme. Sederberg said the stores were notified
[27:28.340 --> 27:32.660]  by mail this week. And if they continue to operate as unlicensed retail outlets for the black market,
[27:32.660 --> 27:37.780]  they'll face civil and criminal ramifications. So these shops are not registered and they're
[27:37.780 --> 27:44.420]  operating like medical marijuana dispensaries. It says the 15 stores that received the notice include
[27:44.420 --> 27:48.980]  seven in the white center neighborhood, two in Skyway and six in the eastern part of the county.
[27:48.980 --> 27:53.780]  Messages left at Northwest Cannabis Market in Seattle and Military Road Holistic in Auburn
[27:53.780 --> 27:59.140]  were not immediately returned. There was no answer at Pacific Coast Natural Medicine in Seattle or
[27:59.140 --> 28:02.420]  the solution Renton. So these people are not answering the phones because they're scared
[28:02.420 --> 28:06.420]  shitless. They're going to get raided probably. They're taking tax money from the state and
[28:06.420 --> 28:10.820]  operating in locations that would never be approved by the LCB, he said. They are blight
[28:10.820 --> 28:16.340]  on the neighborhoods they inhibit. That's a matter of opinion. He said the federal government
[28:16.340 --> 28:21.460]  is watching how Washington regulates the marijuana industry and the success of the law depends on how
[28:21.460 --> 28:26.100]  well local jurisdictions deal with unlicensed retail stores. In addition to sending notifications
[28:26.100 --> 28:30.260]  to the 15 stores, county officials have notified landlords that there is an illegal business
[28:30.260 --> 28:34.260]  operating on the property, he said. This means that if the stores continue to operate illegally,
[28:34.260 --> 28:39.540]  the Liquor and Cannabis Board can go in and seize all of the product. If the civil options don't
[28:39.540 --> 28:43.460]  work, they will consider criminal remedies, he said. We're not going in heavy-handed on this,
[28:43.460 --> 28:48.740]  he said. We're telling them the new scheme has to be followed. The days of the wild, wild west
[28:48.740 --> 28:56.020]  are over. So we saw this kind of happen in Colorado. It's totally still, it just happened
[28:56.020 --> 29:00.260]  in our city like three weeks ago. There was just some dude who was like, yeah, I could do this
[29:00.820 --> 29:04.900]  and just opened up a dispensary essentially out of his house. Oh, that guy's been going on for a
[29:04.900 --> 29:10.900]  while. That guy also was accused of blasting buds, making BHO out of the buds and selling those buds
[29:10.900 --> 29:16.500]  that he blasted back on the black market. Right. Like he stood out like a sore thumb and got turned
[29:16.500 --> 29:21.940]  in by people in the neighborhood or whatever. So. Well, these guys have storefronts with advertising
[29:21.940 --> 29:26.820]  and they're advertising just like a normal store. And now they're going to either have to get raided.
[29:26.820 --> 29:31.300]  I hope they don't bring it to that because this is what sucks. You have a state that allows you
[29:31.300 --> 29:36.580]  to do this. And then people like this don't follow the rules and they fuck it up for everybody. So
[29:36.580 --> 29:39.860]  they're going to have to go in there and tell them to shut this down. And if they don't, they're
[29:39.860 --> 29:44.180]  going to get raided, bro. Right. The feds will come in and take all of their shit. Like at this
[29:44.180 --> 29:50.020]  point in Colorado, you just Google the rules and then follow the path laid out and you can have
[29:50.020 --> 29:56.500]  your marijuana store. You just, you just follow the rules and do it. Or you can just put a sign
[29:56.500 --> 30:02.180]  in your front yard and get yourself a whiteboard and a couple of jars and a cash register and go
[30:02.180 --> 30:06.180]  to town out of your living room and wait for the cops to show up. And they will show up and you'll
[30:06.180 --> 30:11.300]  be charged with unlawful distribution of marijuana. He'll be charged kinds of stuff. Possession of
[30:11.300 --> 30:15.620]  marijuana crime to do all that. Unless you're a dispensary owner. Yep. All right, guys, we've
[30:15.620 --> 30:19.940]  been going 30 minutes. Um, that's enough news for the day. Hey Mike, thanks for coming over, bro.
[30:19.940 --> 30:22.980]  Yeah, man. Uh, we got to wrap it up pretty quickly. Cause Mike's got somewhere to be.
[30:23.540 --> 30:26.740]  Uh, let's see. What else do we have on the list here? I've got a couple of questions from
[30:26.740 --> 30:31.780]  Periscope. I'm going to save those for another episode. I do need to remind you guys, nature's
[30:31.780 --> 30:37.620]  green remedies.com has changed their name. Nature's green remedies.com has a new website. Make sure
[30:37.620 --> 30:44.420]  you check out the dank team.com the dank team.com. Make sure you check them out. I don't have a
[30:44.420 --> 30:49.380]  coupon code for you yet. They're still rebuilding the website, getting everything going. So make
[30:49.380 --> 30:53.380]  sure you check out the dank team.com. Give them a shout out. Much love, much respect. What's up
[30:53.380 --> 30:58.100]  Yankee. I hope you're listening to this one, bro. Hope everything's going well for you. So make sure
[30:58.100 --> 31:02.660]  you guys follow me on Periscope, dude. I have been on Periscope quite a bit. Uh, my account is just,
[31:02.660 --> 31:07.300]  uh, Ross to Jeff on there. Um, all the news you guys have been hearing, not all of it,
[31:07.300 --> 31:10.980]  but a good portion of the news that I've been bringing to you guys has been getting tweeted to
[31:10.980 --> 31:16.100]  me from Mike. So Mike, thanks for sending me all the news, giving us content. Happy to bro. I've
[31:16.100 --> 31:19.940]  been doing two shows a week because you've got so much news content for me to keep the people
[31:19.940 --> 31:25.620]  informed. That's the truth. It's so awesome. Right? Like prohibition was, it was just everything.
[31:25.620 --> 31:31.380]  Like no one questioned it when we were kids and now that dam is breaking and if more people start
[31:31.380 --> 31:34.900]  getting active and more people are informed, we're going to win. We're so fucking close.
[31:35.780 --> 31:40.420]  We are winning. Yeah. There were almost a, the 50, 50 line is almost crossed. There are almost
[31:40.420 --> 31:45.300]  more legal States than unlegal States now, which is when that crosses. I think that's when something
[31:45.300 --> 31:50.980]  will happen. We broke the population 50, 50 line already. Nice. It's just the numerical state
[31:50.980 --> 31:55.940]  number now. Okay. Well, there's like a hundred East coast States with like eight people in them.
[31:55.940 --> 32:00.900]  So yeah, because they're the size of Denver. Okay. Um, before we get too far, I want to not forget
[32:00.900 --> 32:07.700]  to give shout outs to Mark Dank, Ravanne Arnie. Um, also a happy birthday to my cousin, Brandy.
[32:07.700 --> 32:11.220]  I don't know if you listened to this show, but Brandy, I love you. I miss you. I hope you're
[32:11.220 --> 32:15.380]  having a great birthday. This comes out on July 16th. That is her birthday. So if you guys are
[32:15.380 --> 32:19.220]  smoking a bowl, if you're taking a dab blowing up in the air for my cousin, Brandy right now,
[32:19.220 --> 32:22.500]  she was one of my best friends growing up. She's like my little sister. I love you a bunch. So
[32:22.500 --> 32:27.140]  happy birthday girl. Um, also, um, I'm going to talk about one more thing and then we're going to
[32:27.140 --> 32:33.860]  wrap it up, dude. There's a guy on Instagram who calls himself Bobo blaster co he's got a website.
[32:33.860 --> 32:41.540]  It is burniture.bigcartel.com. That dude sent me this table. I've only had it set up for a day.
[32:41.540 --> 32:45.220]  Now I haven't had a lot of time to play with it, but the time I have had to play with it,
[32:45.220 --> 32:51.460]  I really fucking enjoy it. This dude makes custom coffee tables and tables. He makes bookcases. He
[32:51.460 --> 32:57.780]  makes shelves, but he installs an email in your table for you. So I have now got a coffee table
[32:57.780 --> 33:02.580]  with two email coils coming out of the end of it. Uh, I've got two rigs sitting on the table,
[33:03.220 --> 33:07.860]  both of those nails are hot. We can walk over there and Mike and I can take a dab side by side
[33:08.420 --> 33:12.900]  and choke together. Uh, yesterday I took a picture. I had a couple, I have two friends that are a
[33:12.900 --> 33:16.260]  couple. They were there together and they came over and I told them, go take a dab together.
[33:16.260 --> 33:21.460]  You guys, since they got to go do a couple dab, I thought that was kind of sweet. So, uh, he painted
[33:21.460 --> 33:28.100]  the iRegenetics Colorado logo on the tabletop. Um, it's a three foot, uh, long by, I think that's
[33:28.100 --> 33:32.820]  about two feet wide coffee table. Uh, it's got a little shelf on the bottom. Dude, it's super
[33:32.820 --> 33:38.900]  sturdy. The emails work, bro. I cannot complain about those emails at all. Yeah. It's a walk.
[33:38.900 --> 33:44.900]  Dinner was like, bro, what the fuck? Seriously? He just smiled big and yeah, it's incredible.
[33:44.900 --> 33:50.180]  We're going to have to demo it a little bit and really, really give it a trial and then we'll do
[33:50.180 --> 33:55.540]  a real review. But it, it, it looks this point, I can say it looks just beautiful. And so far
[33:55.540 --> 33:59.380]  it has worked. I've taken several dabs out of it. I've been dabbing out of it since yesterday.
[33:59.380 --> 34:03.700]  He watched me, uh, unbox it on Periscope. He actually was on, I did a Periscope video when
[34:03.700 --> 34:08.980]  it got here, I unboxed it and set it up. So Bobo got to watch me. So you guys big shout out to Bobo
[34:08.980 --> 34:13.620]  blaster co check him out on Instagram. He's making furniture with an email built into it.
[34:13.620 --> 34:17.860]  Uh, if you don't know what that is, you just got to go check out either his Instagram or his website.
[34:17.860 --> 34:25.060]  It's burniture, like the word furniture with a B, uh, burniture.bigcartel.com and big cartel is
[34:25.140 --> 34:30.180]  just like a website. It's like an Etsy or a eBay or something. It's just a retail sales site where
[34:30.180 --> 34:36.020]  anybody can set up their own store. So make sure you check out burniture.bigcartel.com support my
[34:36.020 --> 34:40.260]  buddy. Uh, I endorse this product. I'm going to put it to good use. I'm going to beat the
[34:40.260 --> 34:44.820]  shit out of it. I'm going to play hard with it and see if I can't break it. We'll do everything
[34:44.820 --> 34:48.020]  we'd normally do with it. And then we'll give them a full review here in a couple of episodes,
[34:48.020 --> 34:50.820]  but make sure you check them out. Cause so far, I think it's a bad-ass product.
[34:50.820 --> 34:54.100]  Looks gorgeous, man. And that logo across the top is really, really good.
[34:54.100 --> 34:57.700]  You did a really good job. Thank you, bro. I appreciate it. I really do appreciate it. It's
[34:57.700 --> 35:02.100]  a great gift. Uh, I don't deserve that. I looked on the website to see what he sells these tables
[35:02.100 --> 35:06.980]  for and I am, uh, completely grateful and appreciative of the gift you have sent me.
[35:06.980 --> 35:10.340]  Thank you, brother. I really appreciate it. All right, you guys, it's time to start wrapping up
[35:10.340 --> 35:14.660]  the show. I've got some notes here that I like to read toward the end of the show. Um, this should

[38:39.110 --> 38:44.390]  No, man, I've been a bit of a farming and the farmer is the smallest in the market.
[38:44.390 --> 38:50.710]  The bigger box. I saw them control for export it. See you.
