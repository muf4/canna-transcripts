[00:17.400 --> 00:20.160]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.160 --> 00:21.680]  It's time for episode number 118
[00:21.680 --> 00:23.460]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.460 --> 00:27.720]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.720 --> 00:28.920]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.920 --> 00:30.080]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.080 --> 00:32.200]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.200 --> 00:34.040]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:34.040 --> 00:36.520]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.520 --> 00:39.520]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.320]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.320 --> 00:43.160]  I wanna thank you again for joining me.
[00:43.160 --> 00:45.360]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.880]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.920 --> 00:49.080]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:49.080 --> 00:52.400]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.560 --> 00:56.600]  I hope you guys are having a great week.
[00:56.600 --> 00:58.720]  I hope you've got a pen and some paper handy
[00:58.720 --> 01:01.240]  because this episode is loaded with information.
[01:01.240 --> 01:03.040]  You guys, this time we had our friend Sean,
[01:03.040 --> 01:05.040]  also known as King Cola drop by,
[01:05.040 --> 01:07.240]  and we're going to talk about integrated pest management
[01:07.240 --> 01:10.120]  and we're also going to talk about organic hemp farming.
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.580]  This is a great episode in my opinion.
[01:11.580 --> 01:14.600]  So grab a pen and paper and get ready for some information.
[01:14.600 --> 01:16.360]  But before I get that far,
[01:16.400 --> 01:18.120]  this podcast is brought to you by my good friends
[01:18.120 --> 01:20.440]  at Hitman Glass, Hitman Glass.
[01:20.440 --> 01:21.960]  When I'm shopping for a new rig,
[01:21.960 --> 01:25.080]  I like to buy something made in America by an American.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.720]  I like to buy a dab rig made by somebody
[01:26.720 --> 01:27.840]  who dabs as hard as I do.
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.440]  That's why I support Hitman Glass, you guys.
[01:29.440 --> 01:32.480]  Hitman Glass, they're made in Southern California.
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.980]  You can check out hitmanglass.com for more information.
[01:34.980 --> 01:37.160]  Make sure you follow my friend Hitman Glass Duggee
[01:37.160 --> 01:38.160]  on Instagram.
[01:38.160 --> 01:40.140]  If you're gonna be in California this summer,
[01:40.140 --> 01:42.760]  I hugely recommend that you check out the Chalice Festival.
[01:42.760 --> 01:45.440]  The Chalice Festival, hash, music, and art.
[01:45.440 --> 01:47.080]  There's not another festival like it.
[01:47.080 --> 01:48.500]  It'll be an amazing time.
[01:48.500 --> 01:50.780]  Hopefully I will see you there.
[01:50.780 --> 01:52.800]  All right, you guys, let's get right down to business.
[01:52.800 --> 01:54.840]  I'm gonna let the music play for a couple of seconds
[01:54.840 --> 01:56.100]  and I'm gonna use the time machine
[01:56.100 --> 01:57.880]  to get us back a couple of days ago.
[01:57.880 --> 01:58.800]  And when we land there,
[01:58.800 --> 02:00.480]  Sean will be sitting at the table with me.
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.820]  So hang on, here it goes.
[02:03.760 --> 02:05.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[02:05.160 --> 02:07.080]  Across the table from me is my good buddy Sean,
[02:07.080 --> 02:08.000]  also known as King Cola.
[02:08.000 --> 02:08.840]  How you doing tonight, bro?
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.200]  Good, man, thanks for having me.
[02:10.200 --> 02:11.080]  Oh man, thanks for coming.
[02:11.080 --> 02:13.280]  Your eyes are as red as mine feel, bro.
[02:13.280 --> 02:14.640]  Yeah, man, it's been a while.
[02:14.640 --> 02:15.680]  Appreciate you having me.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.520]  Howdy, thanks for coming.
[02:16.520 --> 02:17.840]  You brought some delicious skunk.
[02:17.840 --> 02:18.760]  That tastes amazing.
[02:18.760 --> 02:19.880]  Yeah, thanks for the dab,
[02:19.880 --> 02:22.120]  but I don't know what that was, but it was ridiculous.
[02:22.120 --> 02:23.200]  Well, now I get to brag.
[02:23.200 --> 02:25.800]  That was G Funk turned into live resin
[02:25.800 --> 02:26.920]  by our friends at Turpex.
[02:26.920 --> 02:30.120]  I actually grew those flowers at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[02:30.120 --> 02:32.520]  That was my first harvest at the grove.
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.280]  So thanks for the huge compliment.
[02:34.280 --> 02:35.280]  You didn't even know what that was
[02:35.280 --> 02:36.280]  and you said it was awesome.
[02:36.280 --> 02:37.520]  Congratulations, man.
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.440]  Thanks a lot, man.
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.240]  So we brought Sean on the show
[02:40.240 --> 02:42.840]  to talk about some integrated pest management.
[02:42.880 --> 02:44.560]  But before we get there,
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.440]  man, tell the people what you have been up to.
[02:46.440 --> 02:48.040]  It's been a long time since you've been on the show.
[02:48.040 --> 02:49.000]  Build some credibility
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.920]  and let all these folks know what you're up to.
[02:50.920 --> 02:54.360]  So I think the last time I was here,
[02:54.360 --> 02:57.640]  I was working on a Three Rivers Organics project.
[02:57.640 --> 03:01.440]  So nice organic grow out here in Pueblo.
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.240]  Finished it out, turned it over to some great guys.
[03:04.240 --> 03:06.720]  So they're, from what I understand,
[03:06.720 --> 03:09.200]  they're pumping out some great product right now.
[03:09.200 --> 03:10.760]  So congrats to them.
[03:10.760 --> 03:13.440]  Before I moved on, was doing some,
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.200]  just some consultation in the industry,
[03:15.200 --> 03:16.600]  different grow gigs,
[03:16.600 --> 03:18.080]  writing some stuff out,
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.960]  helping some extraction companies.
[03:19.960 --> 03:22.600]  And now I'm actually involved in a hemp project.
[03:22.600 --> 03:25.440]  So we're a nutritional hemp company.
[03:25.440 --> 03:28.640]  We're pulled our permits through the CDA.
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.800]  We're all legal.
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.800]  Everything that we grow is under 0.3% THC.
[03:33.800 --> 03:36.200]  So you can smoke my whole farm and not get high.
[03:37.800 --> 03:39.680]  We're really excited about this project.
[03:39.720 --> 03:41.800]  What is the CBD level of that?
[03:41.800 --> 03:44.640]  15% is what we're averaging right now.
[03:44.640 --> 03:45.960]  High medicinal value.
[03:45.960 --> 03:46.800]  Exactly.
[03:46.800 --> 03:47.640]  Very great.
[03:47.640 --> 03:49.240]  So we're specializing in extraction of that
[03:49.240 --> 03:51.040]  through critical CO2.
[03:51.040 --> 03:51.920]  Very good.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.040]  Is that, do you need to be a medical patient
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.120]  to receive that since it's no THC?
[03:56.120 --> 03:57.080]  You don't have to be,
[03:57.080 --> 03:59.240]  you can be any age from any state,
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.760]  anywhere in the world.
[04:00.760 --> 04:02.560]  Just come here to Colorado and get it from me.
[04:02.560 --> 04:03.400]  That's amazing.
[04:03.400 --> 04:04.240]  Yeah.
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.080]  Any amount.
[04:05.080 --> 04:06.400]  He invited you, come get it, you guys.
[04:06.400 --> 04:08.280]  It'll be available fairly soon.
[04:08.280 --> 04:09.960]  So you said the word nutritional hemp.
[04:09.960 --> 04:12.320]  Is that something, a phrase you coined?
[04:12.320 --> 04:15.760]  I mean, you could say that.
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.040]  Technically we pulled an industrial hemp license.
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.280]  And industrial hemp traditionally thought
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.680]  is gonna be fuel, fiber, seed crop.
[04:26.680 --> 04:27.520]  Okay.
[04:28.760 --> 04:31.560]  In Pueblo there's actually a ban on male plants.
[04:31.560 --> 04:34.200]  Me and you had kind of discussed this earlier.
[04:34.200 --> 04:36.480]  And we don't grow male plants.
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.520]  We don't do, traditionally in a hemp operation
[04:40.520 --> 04:43.560]  they drop a pound and a half a seed per acre.
[04:43.560 --> 04:46.040]  There'd be a 50-50 male to female ratio
[04:46.040 --> 04:48.240]  that rely on the male plant pollen
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.040]  to drop the THC levels in the female
[04:51.040 --> 04:53.800]  to give them that 0.03.
[04:53.800 --> 04:56.920]  Whereas we have been selectively breeding
[04:58.320 --> 05:01.920]  these high CBD, low THC ratio strains,
[05:01.920 --> 05:03.600]  just like people have been breeding
[05:03.600 --> 05:06.040]  high THC, low CBD strains.
[05:06.600 --> 05:10.080]  It's a really similar approach to growing
[05:10.080 --> 05:12.000]  is traditional MMJ style.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.800]  But with it's industrial,
[05:14.800 --> 05:17.200]  technically it's industrial hemp.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.280]  Because we don't do the male plants
[05:19.280 --> 05:21.440]  and we're going for the more of the medicinal,
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.840]  nutritional factors of it,
[05:22.840 --> 05:26.160]  that's why we try to coin this term nutritional hemp.
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.760]  Because it's not FDA approved,
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.240]  I do not say there are any medical purposes.
[05:30.240 --> 05:31.080]  Right, okay.
[05:31.080 --> 05:32.480]  That's a way to play it safe.
[05:32.480 --> 05:34.080]  We appreciate that.
[05:34.080 --> 05:35.480]  All right.
[05:35.520 --> 05:36.840]  Do you want to shout out the name of your farm?
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.280]  Yeah, Sandsol CBD.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.120]  There we go.
[05:40.120 --> 05:41.440]  Yeah, can't say that enough.
[05:41.440 --> 05:42.280]  Sandsol CBD.
[05:42.280 --> 05:44.920]  Everybody go and check us out on Instagram, Facebook.
[05:45.960 --> 05:48.120]  You go to my Instagram, King Cola.
[05:48.120 --> 05:50.600]  You can find links through various pictures.
[05:50.600 --> 05:53.200]  But we've been busting it out there.
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.640]  We've got about 20 acres that we'll be farming this season.
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.080]  We've got a 3,000 square foot greenhouse,
[06:00.080 --> 06:02.720]  11, 2,000 square foot hoop houses,
[06:02.720 --> 06:05.040]  and a 10,000 square foot forever flowering
[06:05.560 --> 06:06.480]  under construction.
[06:07.720 --> 06:10.960]  We're really planning on producing the highest quality
[06:10.960 --> 06:13.920]  organic CBD that's ever been produced.
[06:13.920 --> 06:15.880]  It sounds like you're on the right path for that.
[06:15.880 --> 06:16.880]  Thanks, man.
[06:16.880 --> 06:19.240]  So you said that you've got to have all females
[06:19.240 --> 06:20.080]  and no males.
[06:20.080 --> 06:22.200]  With the number of plants that you're working with,
[06:22.200 --> 06:24.440]  I know the traditional way is to just flower them out.
[06:24.440 --> 06:25.440]  You cut a clone and flower them.
[06:25.440 --> 06:27.400]  You're working with a very large number of plants.
[06:27.400 --> 06:28.240]  You told me the number.
[06:28.240 --> 06:31.200]  I don't know if I have liberty to say those numbers.
[06:31.200 --> 06:33.440]  You know, we can,
[06:33.440 --> 06:35.160]  so you just,
[06:35.160 --> 06:37.880]  the guys can do the math at home if they really want to.
[06:37.880 --> 06:40.000]  20 acres on six foot centers.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.120]  So you do the math on that.
[06:42.120 --> 06:44.320]  But it's a lot of fucking plants.
[06:44.320 --> 06:45.640]  That is a whole shit ton of plants.
[06:45.640 --> 06:47.080]  There's more plants than I ever imagined
[06:47.080 --> 06:48.120]  being responsible for.
[06:48.120 --> 06:48.960]  When you said the number,
[06:48.960 --> 06:50.280]  I almost pooped myself a little bit.
[06:50.280 --> 06:53.080]  Yeah, every time I think about it,
[06:53.080 --> 06:54.160]  you know, I feel that way.
[06:54.160 --> 06:56.480]  But every day it seems like more of a reality.
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.000]  You know, we started out with nothing.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.240]  This was an empty field four months ago.
[07:01.280 --> 07:04.280]  And now we've got this infrastructure we do.
[07:04.280 --> 07:05.920]  And I still have a while.
[07:05.920 --> 07:06.880]  And a large crew.
[07:06.880 --> 07:07.720]  You've got a large crew out there.
[07:07.720 --> 07:08.800]  We've got a great team out there.
[07:08.800 --> 07:11.400]  I couldn't stress it enough.
[07:11.400 --> 07:15.640]  Pablo, Justin, Eric, Chris, Kelly, Tony,
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.120]  everybody out there is just,
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.720]  it's not just me kicking ass.
[07:18.720 --> 07:19.560]  I mean, these guys are-
[07:19.560 --> 07:20.400]  I hope you guys all heard that.
[07:20.400 --> 07:21.520]  Yeah, I'm gonna,
[07:21.520 --> 07:23.000]  it's their job, I'll make them listen.
[07:23.000 --> 07:23.960]  Nice.
[07:23.960 --> 07:25.240]  So what I was getting to is,
[07:25.240 --> 07:27.240]  how do you know that all of those plants,
[07:27.240 --> 07:28.880]  how do you verify that all of those plants
[07:28.880 --> 07:30.000]  are females out there?
[07:30.840 --> 07:32.000]  Everything's from clone.
[07:32.000 --> 07:32.840]  Okay.
[07:32.840 --> 07:35.800]  So everything, yeah, is from clone.
[07:35.800 --> 07:38.120]  It's gonna, we, you know,
[07:38.120 --> 07:39.440]  just like you would indoor,
[07:39.440 --> 07:42.320]  we start off, see batch,
[07:42.320 --> 07:43.640]  call out the males.
[07:43.640 --> 07:44.600]  So you actually had to grow,
[07:44.600 --> 07:45.720]  you had to flower some of them out?
[07:45.720 --> 07:47.760]  Yeah, test, you know,
[07:47.760 --> 07:49.640]  flower them out, call the males,
[07:49.640 --> 07:51.240]  test out the females.
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.920]  We knew what we were working with,
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.000]  what to look for.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.640]  So it wasn't as difficult as one would think,
[07:57.640 --> 07:59.120]  because this is already something
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.400]  that was in existence,
[08:00.400 --> 08:01.720]  a Suzy Q,
[08:01.720 --> 08:04.640]  which there's maybe some people are familiar with.
[08:04.640 --> 08:07.800]  So it wasn't too hard for us to work it out.
[08:07.800 --> 08:11.560]  We started out with a good,
[08:11.560 --> 08:13.160]  quite a few females,
[08:13.160 --> 08:15.320]  and then slowly built our way up.
[08:15.320 --> 08:18.120]  And then now we've got a whole army of other plants,
[08:19.440 --> 08:20.720]  just cloning, cloning, cloning.
[08:20.720 --> 08:21.640]  That's the name of the game.
[08:21.640 --> 08:25.200]  I've got a 10,000 square foot propagation building,
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.760]  or greenhouse going up,
[08:26.800 --> 08:29.400]  and it will be used for half of it for mothers,
[08:29.400 --> 08:30.920]  half of it for clones.
[08:30.920 --> 08:32.760]  So you said the strain was called Suzy Q?
[08:32.760 --> 08:33.600]  Yeah, Suzy Q.
[08:33.600 --> 08:36.520]  Okay, so you guys that are kind of just learning,
[08:36.520 --> 08:39.240]  just like you'd buy some pot called sour diesel,
[08:39.240 --> 08:40.280]  or OG Kush,
[08:40.280 --> 08:42.680]  the hemp has the varietals the same way.
[08:42.680 --> 08:45.480]  Yeah, right now, Centennial Seeds,
[08:45.480 --> 08:46.880]  their shout out to,
[08:46.880 --> 08:47.840]  I don't know if you're familiar.
[08:47.840 --> 08:49.040]  I'm very familiar.
[08:49.040 --> 08:51.000]  I went and met with the guy,
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.560]  the owner of the company.
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.440]  I think his name's Ben?
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.280]  Ben, yeah.
[08:54.280 --> 08:55.120]  Okay, yeah.
[08:55.120 --> 08:55.960]  So he's a great guy.
[08:56.720 --> 08:59.800]  And he's got a lot of wisdom.
[08:59.800 --> 09:00.640]  Yes, we are.
[09:01.560 --> 09:03.680]  So we're growing his auto in box out there too.
[09:03.680 --> 09:05.480]  We've got auto two at Green and Healthy.
[09:05.480 --> 09:06.320]  So we've got.
[09:06.320 --> 09:07.160]  That'll be coming up in the future.
[09:07.160 --> 09:08.920]  Yeah, we've got auto 11.
[09:08.920 --> 09:09.760]  Great.
[09:09.760 --> 09:10.600]  Yeah, so.
[09:10.600 --> 09:11.440]  Maybe ours is auto 11,
[09:11.440 --> 09:13.560]  and I just read it as Roman numeral two.
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.400]  It's Roman numeral two.
[09:14.400 --> 09:15.240]  Okay.
[09:15.240 --> 09:16.240]  Or maybe it's Roman numeral two,
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.560]  and I'm reading it as 11.
[09:17.560 --> 09:18.640]  So who knows?
[09:18.640 --> 09:19.920]  We'll have to ask him one day.
[09:19.920 --> 09:20.760]  We just call it auto.
[09:20.760 --> 09:22.320]  But yeah, so there's phenos in there
[09:22.320 --> 09:23.800]  that run every which way.
[09:23.800 --> 09:25.480]  So we still,
[09:26.320 --> 09:28.160]  we're running in mass.
[09:28.160 --> 09:30.480]  I won't really release what we're running in particular,
[09:30.480 --> 09:32.080]  but those are the strains we're running.
[09:32.080 --> 09:33.240]  We're running in mass.
[09:33.240 --> 09:38.240]  What we know for certain is our 15% CBD under 0.3.
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.720]  It's actually testing at 0.25% THC right now.
[09:43.720 --> 09:44.960]  Wow.
[09:44.960 --> 09:47.600]  The other strains are pretty experimental.
[09:47.600 --> 09:49.000]  We still have a while.
[09:50.200 --> 09:52.240]  I'll get a good flower.
[09:52.240 --> 09:53.680]  I'll get a good harvest off.
[09:54.520 --> 09:56.160]  And then we'll maybe propagate a couple of thousand
[09:56.160 --> 09:57.960]  and put them out into the field.
[09:57.960 --> 10:00.600]  But yeah, so everything,
[10:00.600 --> 10:02.240]  since we can't grow for male,
[10:02.240 --> 10:03.480]  or we can't have male plants,
[10:03.480 --> 10:07.240]  everything has to be taken from a tested female.
[10:07.240 --> 10:08.600]  Okay.
[10:08.600 --> 10:10.800]  Is there a lab test for that that you can use?
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.840]  Actually, there are lab tests.
[10:13.840 --> 10:15.640]  So we've been working with,
[10:15.640 --> 10:18.440]  we used to work with labs here in the state.
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.400]  All of a sudden, MED wanted to be a-holes
[10:22.400 --> 10:25.120]  and come out and say that licensed
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.440]  or MED certified testing facilities
[10:27.440 --> 10:30.120]  are no longer allowed to test hemp.
[10:30.120 --> 10:31.760]  Did they have an excuse for that?
[10:31.760 --> 10:34.960]  I believe it's because the tracking system
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.520]  isn't implemented with the hemp.
[10:36.520 --> 10:38.920]  So the CDA is supposed to start implementing
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.080]  the RD or the radio frequency tags.
[10:43.080 --> 10:45.520]  So RDIF, I can't remember the acronym.
[10:45.520 --> 10:46.360]  RFIDs.
[10:46.360 --> 10:47.200]  There you go.
[10:47.200 --> 10:48.040]  Yeah, I have to play with those every day.
[10:48.040 --> 10:50.440]  Yeah, so they're supposed to start issuing
[10:50.480 --> 10:53.200]  some of those for us after harvest
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.840]  to get us into these testing facilities.
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.640]  So back in the day, last summer, basically,
[11:01.640 --> 11:03.320]  at the end of this harvest season
[11:03.320 --> 11:06.040]  is when they kind of implemented that law.
[11:06.040 --> 11:07.120]  Yeah, I think it was November.
[11:07.120 --> 11:09.680]  They quit and we couldn't test anymore.
[11:09.680 --> 11:11.920]  So we haven't really been able to test since then.
[11:11.920 --> 11:13.640]  So we built our own facility.
[11:13.640 --> 11:16.040]  So right now we're building our own testing facility
[11:16.040 --> 11:17.200]  on the farm.
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.360]  There won't be any need to go any outside sources.
[11:21.280 --> 11:22.120]  You guys are problem solvers, aren't you?
[11:22.120 --> 11:24.680]  You know, it's just, yeah, cut out the middle, man.
[11:24.680 --> 11:27.200]  Necessity is the mother of invention, I think they said.
[11:27.200 --> 11:31.600]  Well, you know, the way it works is our governing body,
[11:31.600 --> 11:34.680]  our regulatory agency, is the Department of Agriculture.
[11:34.680 --> 11:37.960]  So we work with the Colorado Department of Agriculture,
[11:37.960 --> 11:39.400]  issued us our permit.
[11:39.400 --> 11:42.360]  We're very open with them, everything we do.
[11:42.360 --> 11:45.440]  They, you know, we file harvest reports, planning reports.
[11:45.440 --> 11:47.200]  It's kind of the way the compliance works,
[11:47.200 --> 11:49.800]  but they test frequently.
[11:50.720 --> 11:52.600]  But, you know, it's sporadic testing.
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.000]  They don't announce when they come
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.840]  and it's usually around harvest.
[11:55.840 --> 11:56.840]  You get a random drug test.
[11:56.840 --> 11:59.080]  Exactly, and the problem is,
[11:59.080 --> 12:02.160]  is if they were to come out and test my field,
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.900]  and you know as well as I do,
[12:05.360 --> 12:09.560]  the cannabinoid count can fluctuate or change
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.400]  due to anything.
[12:10.400 --> 12:12.000]  You get a pest infestation
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.760]  or you get prolonged periods of UV light
[12:14.760 --> 12:16.200]  or you get a drought period.
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.840]  Whatever happens, but you can have exterior factors
[12:20.840 --> 12:23.480]  that can change the cannabinoid count.
[12:23.480 --> 12:24.320]  Absolutely.
[12:24.320 --> 12:27.680]  So if I have the CDA come in and we're at 4%,
[12:27.680 --> 12:31.840]  5%, or .4, .5, I have to destroy my crop.
[12:31.840 --> 12:34.240]  Wow, 4.5 is your limit on THC?
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.360]  .3% is my limit.
[12:36.360 --> 12:40.960]  So anything over .3 has to be destroyed on the property.
[12:40.960 --> 12:42.160]  Man, that's terrible.
[12:42.160 --> 12:43.360]  I'd hate to have to see that.
[12:43.360 --> 12:44.760]  Yeah, so that's the, you know,
[12:44.760 --> 12:46.840]  we'll build our own testing facility.
[12:46.840 --> 12:47.720]  You know, it's worth it.
[12:47.720 --> 12:50.360]  That way we can test these things periodically
[12:50.360 --> 12:52.960]  and make sure we have that consistent product.
[12:52.960 --> 12:56.320]  Same thing with, we'll be doing our own extraction.
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.120]  Now we can do our own in-house lab testing,
[12:59.120 --> 13:01.040]  our own in-house homogenized testing.
[13:01.040 --> 13:03.800]  So as we're releasing large batch products,
[13:03.800 --> 13:05.880]  you know, everything's gonna be the same quality.
[13:05.880 --> 13:08.120]  Everything's gonna be the same grade.
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.360]  You know, that's something that I really,
[13:11.360 --> 13:14.800]  I'm so fortunate to be a part of this organization
[13:14.800 --> 13:17.040]  because they believe the same way I do
[13:17.040 --> 13:20.960]  that we will not skip things like that.
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.200]  When it comes to health and it comes to the purity
[13:24.200 --> 13:27.000]  of the product, we don't fuck around.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.160]  You guys should see the look on his face.
[13:29.160 --> 13:30.160]  This dude's serious.
[13:30.160 --> 13:31.000]  He's serious.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.040]  They do not fuck around.
[13:32.040 --> 13:33.560]  Dude, big thanks and much respect for that.
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.040]  We've needed people to come to this industry like that.
[13:36.040 --> 13:38.200]  When a lot of the new rules came into play,
[13:38.200 --> 13:39.640]  a lot of money came into play.
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.200]  The guys with a lot of heart like you and I
[13:42.040 --> 13:43.800]  pushed away by the guys with a lot of money
[13:43.800 --> 13:44.640]  and a lot of backing.
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.600]  So it's good to see some heart
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.320]  coming back into this industry.
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.160]  Thank you.
[13:48.160 --> 13:49.720]  And it's good, you know, likewise, man.
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.200]  It's good to see where you're at too.
[13:51.200 --> 13:52.040]  Thank you, man.
[13:52.040 --> 13:52.880]  Much respect.
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.680]  So is there a market for a feminized hemp seed?
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.880]  Yes, but the question is, is how do you feminize your seed?
[14:01.880 --> 14:04.760]  And is colloidal silver registered through the CDA?
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.960]  See, I have bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.880]  He didn't, I can't blank stare back.
[14:11.720 --> 14:14.000]  I asked, yeah.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.240]  But no, the market's getting there.
[14:16.240 --> 14:18.240]  You know, that's something that we're looking at.
[14:18.240 --> 14:20.320]  We're very interested and everybody's interested
[14:20.320 --> 14:23.080]  in creating your own seed stock.
[14:23.080 --> 14:25.720]  What farm isn't interested in creating their own seed stock?
[14:25.720 --> 14:28.320]  Especially something, you know,
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.320]  the CBD industry is where the MMJ industry was 10 years ago.
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.200]  This is, there's me and like six other companies out there.
[14:38.200 --> 14:39.480]  There's not a lot of us.
[14:39.480 --> 14:41.600]  And if you think that six companies a lot,
[14:41.600 --> 14:43.240]  you've obviously never driven through Denver
[14:43.240 --> 14:45.320]  and seen the dispensaries.
[14:45.320 --> 14:49.680]  There are six dispensaries on South Broadway in two blocks.
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.040]  All right, so man, that's a lot of information
[14:53.040 --> 14:54.340]  in the first 12 minutes of a show.
[14:54.340 --> 14:56.080]  So I truly appreciate all of that.
[14:56.080 --> 14:57.680]  Does that give him credibility, you guys?
[14:57.680 --> 14:59.400]  Can I start asking questions about stuff
[14:59.400 --> 15:00.520]  that we need advice on now?
[15:00.520 --> 15:01.360]  Do you believe him?
[15:01.360 --> 15:02.200]  I hope so.
[15:02.200 --> 15:03.960]  Dude, every time I see you,
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.080]  you've gone 12 steps ahead of yourself and I love it.
[15:07.080 --> 15:08.320]  Congratulations, keep going, man.
[15:08.320 --> 15:09.640]  That's freaking awesome.
[15:09.640 --> 15:11.600]  So what we brought you here for
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.280]  is to actually talk about integrated pest management.
[15:14.280 --> 15:17.080]  So you're running a huge outdoor.
[15:17.080 --> 15:18.520]  You were telling me what you were doing earlier.
[15:18.520 --> 15:20.440]  Do you want to tell me about,
[15:20.440 --> 15:22.880]  you can start with the posting of the Instagram picture
[15:22.880 --> 15:23.720]  and how your friends are playing.
[15:23.720 --> 15:24.560]  Let's have that conversation.
[15:24.560 --> 15:26.680]  I'm gonna just be real with you guys
[15:26.680 --> 15:28.720]  because people run into problems
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.800]  and I ran into some problems.
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.600]  So we'll just kind of go over what happened to me,
[15:34.600 --> 15:36.480]  what I used as treatment.
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.560]  And then what we do now is weekly preventative measures
[15:40.560 --> 15:42.360]  and we'll kind of start there.
[15:42.360 --> 15:43.560]  And keep in mind, you guys,
[15:43.560 --> 15:46.360]  this is in a greenhouse and outdoor setting.
[15:46.360 --> 15:47.660]  And then once he gets through with this,
[15:47.660 --> 15:49.960]  I will ask questions about indoor stuff.
[15:49.960 --> 15:53.280]  Okay, so well, yeah, this is, you can run this.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.000]  Everything that we're talking about
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.860]  can be ran in an indoor environment also.
[15:58.860 --> 16:03.860]  So we were running in our greenhouses, transplanting plants.
[16:04.780 --> 16:07.260]  We actually just moved from an indoor environment.
[16:07.260 --> 16:09.320]  We were growing in a small warehouse
[16:09.320 --> 16:12.140]  and then moved everything into our greenhouse.
[16:12.140 --> 16:16.740]  And if anybody out there is familiar with greenhouse growing,
[16:16.740 --> 16:17.900]  it's not easy.
[16:17.900 --> 16:20.300]  It's not an indoor environment.
[16:20.300 --> 16:23.300]  This isn't something that you can just fire up,
[16:23.300 --> 16:24.780]  put plants into.
[16:25.660 --> 16:28.580]  Unfortunately, investors don't see it that way.
[16:28.580 --> 16:30.100]  Business owners don't see it that way.
[16:30.100 --> 16:31.160]  They want plants in there.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.240]  We introduce plants as fast as possible.
[16:34.240 --> 16:36.340]  The environment isn't where it needs to be.
[16:38.640 --> 16:41.480]  There's just a lot of stresses that are going on at the time
[16:41.480 --> 16:43.240]  and that kind of goes to the first step
[16:43.240 --> 16:44.720]  in integrative pest management.
[16:44.720 --> 16:47.400]  This is a real dumb statement,
[16:47.400 --> 16:50.780]  but healthy plants are less likely to get sick.
[16:52.680 --> 16:54.680]  That makes complete sense to me.
[16:54.680 --> 16:55.520]  Yeah.
[16:55.520 --> 16:56.800]  And when you're saying that,
[16:56.800 --> 17:01.320]  I really mean that if your environment's in good condition
[17:01.320 --> 17:03.120]  and your water's in good condition
[17:03.120 --> 17:04.840]  and your light is good condition,
[17:04.840 --> 17:06.400]  and it's like a report card.
[17:06.400 --> 17:09.760]  If you're hitting A's in all of these things,
[17:09.760 --> 17:12.880]  if one fails, you're still gonna average out.
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.280]  So you need, we rely on this system to catch us.
[17:17.280 --> 17:20.800]  So if you're half-assed in everything,
[17:20.800 --> 17:23.040]  you're gonna run into problems.
[17:23.840 --> 17:27.840]  We stepped into this greenhouse not fully ready.
[17:27.840 --> 17:31.560]  We half-assed some things and we ran into some problems.
[17:31.560 --> 17:33.080]  And it's life.
[17:33.080 --> 17:34.960]  I'm human, so we run into problems.
[17:36.480 --> 17:39.520]  We ran in there, running into some environmental issues.
[17:39.520 --> 17:40.800]  We were getting them straightened out
[17:40.800 --> 17:43.040]  and the plants weren't as healthy as they should have been.
[17:43.040 --> 17:46.680]  Soil was on point, feeding schedule,
[17:46.680 --> 17:48.220]  everything was right where it should be,
[17:48.220 --> 17:50.400]  but things were lagging.
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.200]  Plant growth was slowing.
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.720]  We were having some issues,
[17:53.720 --> 17:55.740]  couldn't really figure out what they were.
[17:55.740 --> 17:57.760]  We were actually posted some,
[17:58.680 --> 17:59.720]  I'll let you guys be the judge.
[17:59.720 --> 18:00.960]  Go on my Instagram picture
[18:00.960 --> 18:03.120]  and see if you're smart as these people are.
[18:03.120 --> 18:05.880]  And see if you can't find the picture that tipped them off
[18:05.880 --> 18:07.400]  to where I was actually contacted
[18:07.400 --> 18:10.080]  by Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.760]  Shout out to Josh, Kelly, and Sky.
[18:11.760 --> 18:13.720]  You guys are my saviors.
[18:13.720 --> 18:14.760]  We're gonna get them on the show,
[18:14.760 --> 18:16.000]  even if it's through Skype or something.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.440]  Yeah, you have to.
[18:17.440 --> 18:20.480]  They're just pioneers at what they do.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.560]  They really helped,
[18:25.400 --> 18:28.200]  influenced the way that I'm setting my farm up for sure.
[18:29.440 --> 18:31.080]  So they actually contacted me
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.200]  and noticed that we had some leaf curling,
[18:35.200 --> 18:36.640]  the way that they were curling,
[18:36.640 --> 18:38.720]  kind of some of the discoloration problems
[18:38.720 --> 18:39.980]  that we were having.
[18:41.360 --> 18:44.120]  And through a few other things,
[18:44.120 --> 18:46.720]  they actually saw the pictures and said,
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.200]  hey man, you have broad mites.
[18:49.200 --> 18:50.580]  And I said, oh no.
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.960]  But before I could cry,
[18:54.960 --> 18:57.560]  they had taken care of it
[18:57.560 --> 19:00.480]  and sent me over some predatory mites.
[19:00.480 --> 19:01.520]  And along with that,
[19:01.520 --> 19:04.360]  they actually sent me a little IPM program.
[19:04.360 --> 19:06.380]  So immediately,
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.360]  we were gonna implement these mites.
[19:10.360 --> 19:12.480]  But before I implemented these mites,
[19:12.480 --> 19:14.180]  this is what we actually did.
[19:15.140 --> 19:17.140]  I heat treated the greenhouse.
[19:17.140 --> 19:18.300]  I don't know if you've ever heard of this.
[19:18.300 --> 19:19.580]  You can do this in your grow room
[19:19.580 --> 19:21.260]  if you have spider mites also.
[19:22.700 --> 19:24.860]  Your plants can handle it, don't be scared.
[19:26.140 --> 19:28.380]  Ours did, and I had to have a lot more money
[19:28.380 --> 19:30.780]  invested in mine than you do your grow room.
[19:33.380 --> 19:34.420]  But a heat treatment.
[19:34.420 --> 19:37.020]  So we actually, you can run your grow room
[19:37.020 --> 19:40.940]  at about 120 degrees for about 45 minutes.
[19:40.940 --> 19:42.860]  Holy shit.
[19:42.860 --> 19:44.620]  Your plants will survive.
[19:45.700 --> 19:47.620]  The spider mites won't.
[19:47.620 --> 19:48.620]  Any bugs won't.
[19:48.620 --> 19:52.340]  You're gonna nuke any beneficials or anything in there,
[19:52.340 --> 19:54.900]  but you're gonna sterilize your room to a greater extent.
[19:54.900 --> 19:57.300]  I mean, it's not gonna be perfect.
[19:57.300 --> 19:58.140]  And then,
[20:00.460 --> 20:01.900]  so run it for 45 minutes,
[20:01.900 --> 20:04.940]  coming back off of that for the next 15 minutes.
[20:04.940 --> 20:08.880]  No direct sunlight to hit the leaf, no water.
[20:08.880 --> 20:12.880]  So you wanna slowly cool your room back down,
[20:12.880 --> 20:14.040]  give it about 15 minutes
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.760]  before you start introducing light.
[20:17.120 --> 20:19.160]  There's actually a lot of research on that.
[20:19.160 --> 20:21.400]  So if this is something that you're interested on,
[20:21.400 --> 20:23.000]  you can just go on Google,
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.800]  Google greenhouse heat treatment,
[20:24.800 --> 20:27.440]  and then kinda go those steps.
[20:27.440 --> 20:29.240]  But so that was first step.
[20:29.240 --> 20:30.360]  Hit them with the heat.
[20:30.360 --> 20:32.440]  Burn those motherfuckers.
[20:32.440 --> 20:35.000]  So we hit them with the heat treatment,
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.520]  and then after that, Dragonfly Earth Medicine
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.680]  had sent me some beneficial insects.
[20:41.680 --> 20:43.640]  So we had predatory mites.
[20:43.640 --> 20:46.360]  They actually sent me two different packs.
[20:46.360 --> 20:50.200]  We got, I believe it's a Swarski and Thripex.
[20:50.200 --> 20:52.440]  I'm probably pronouncing it all wrong.
[20:52.440 --> 20:54.440]  But so two different types.
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.040]  Both of them can protect against the broad mite.
[20:58.040 --> 21:01.780]  One of them, the Swarski, I believe it's called,
[21:01.780 --> 21:05.640]  protects against the russet, the spotted, the brown.
[21:05.640 --> 21:08.520]  So that one, the Swarski's all spider mite,
[21:08.520 --> 21:10.000]  and they're the broad.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.600]  Thripex is for thrips and whitefly.
[21:13.600 --> 21:16.000]  And they also, these predatory mites
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.480]  also fight some broad mites.
[21:18.480 --> 21:20.760]  And they feed off each other,
[21:20.760 --> 21:22.280]  because they're carnivorous.
[21:22.280 --> 21:23.200]  So we introduced them.
[21:23.200 --> 21:26.720]  Takes about three weeks for them to inoculate the plant.
[21:26.720 --> 21:30.240]  And before I start, like you guys run out
[21:30.240 --> 21:32.260]  and you wanna start trying this,
[21:33.100 --> 21:35.940]  this doesn't work in a synthetic system.
[21:35.940 --> 21:40.180]  It only works in an organic system.
[21:40.180 --> 21:43.140]  You cannot use, you can't,
[21:43.140 --> 21:45.420]  you certainly can't use any systemics.
[21:45.420 --> 21:49.300]  So you know, don't go and spray things that kill mites
[21:49.300 --> 21:51.220]  and put beneficial mites on your plants,
[21:51.220 --> 21:53.660]  because that's counterproductive.
[21:53.660 --> 21:56.100]  Second thing, don't use synthetic nutrients.
[21:56.100 --> 21:59.940]  Because the thing is, is when you use synthetic nutrients,
[21:59.940 --> 22:02.420]  you're bypassing natural processes.
[22:02.420 --> 22:05.660]  You're feeding your plant through an IV.
[22:05.660 --> 22:09.140]  There's no need for microbiology.
[22:09.140 --> 22:13.580]  There's no need for protozoa, nematodes, and anthropods,
[22:13.580 --> 22:16.160]  because you're just feeding it straight to the root zone.
[22:16.160 --> 22:19.300]  So when you bypass these natural processes,
[22:19.300 --> 22:23.060]  what's happening is you're not allowing the plant
[22:23.060 --> 22:26.640]  to build its natural immune response.
[22:26.640 --> 22:29.380]  So if you can keep it organic,
[22:29.380 --> 22:31.780]  and you can keep this biological system
[22:31.780 --> 22:34.780]  just in check throughout the whole cycle,
[22:34.780 --> 22:36.820]  then when your plant gets infected,
[22:36.820 --> 22:41.100]  the plant itself can react to it.
[22:41.100 --> 22:44.040]  Your plant can fend off spider mites.
[22:46.380 --> 22:48.260]  If your plant couldn't,
[22:48.260 --> 22:50.340]  then there would be way more spider mites
[22:50.340 --> 22:52.140]  than there would be marijuana plants.
[22:52.140 --> 22:55.320]  But your plant can naturally fight off spider mites.
[22:55.320 --> 22:57.980]  The problem is, is that in a synthetic growing environment,
[22:57.980 --> 23:00.820]  especially indoors, your plant has no resistance.
[23:00.820 --> 23:02.460]  Your plant has, it's a puss.
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.900]  Grew up in a plastic bubble.
[23:05.100 --> 23:07.100]  So, and that's kind of the same thing,
[23:07.100 --> 23:11.540]  is that your plant isn't gonna build any resistance
[23:11.540 --> 23:13.980]  if you're feeding it space food the whole time.
[23:15.500 --> 23:17.380]  It needs to digest it.
[23:17.380 --> 23:19.500]  It needs to chew it.
[23:19.500 --> 23:22.940]  It needs to work that whole process out itself.
[23:22.940 --> 23:26.340]  Otherwise, it's just gonna become weak and decrepit
[23:26.460 --> 23:28.420]  and have no defense.
[23:28.420 --> 23:30.220]  Because at that point, what is your plant doing?
[23:30.220 --> 23:34.340]  It's quick vegetative turnovers,
[23:34.340 --> 23:36.380]  fast veg times, and high yields.
[23:36.380 --> 23:38.660]  That's all you care about, and that's all you're focused on.
[23:38.660 --> 23:41.700]  So you're focused on increasing leaf surface area
[23:41.700 --> 23:43.900]  and increasing bud area.
[23:43.900 --> 23:46.660]  You're not worried about increasing root zone.
[23:46.660 --> 23:48.500]  You're not worried about increasing
[23:50.060 --> 23:51.820]  the bricks count of your plant.
[23:51.820 --> 23:53.440]  You're focusing on the wrong things,
[23:53.440 --> 23:55.900]  and there's a lot more to it than that.
[23:56.460 --> 23:57.300]  So when you miss these things,
[23:57.300 --> 23:59.460]  your plant can't defend itself.
[23:59.460 --> 24:02.100]  So just wanted, I forgot to mention that,
[24:02.100 --> 24:04.700]  is this is for organic systems only.
[24:05.860 --> 24:08.340]  And if you're not running an organic system,
[24:08.340 --> 24:09.700]  you're gonna have to spray.
[24:11.380 --> 24:12.860]  Unless you keep it completely clean,
[24:12.860 --> 24:14.780]  you're gonna have to keep a very clean environment.
[24:14.780 --> 24:17.340]  But in an outdoor system, something like we're running,
[24:17.340 --> 24:20.900]  in a greenhouse, in an outdoor hybrid environment,
[24:20.900 --> 24:24.580]  where you're pulling fresh air, not through a HEPA filter.
[24:24.860 --> 24:26.860]  We have shutter fans.
[24:26.860 --> 24:27.700]  We pull through.
[24:27.700 --> 24:28.540]  So you're just getting that outside air right in there.
[24:28.540 --> 24:29.860]  Exactly.
[24:29.860 --> 24:32.860]  It was seven degrees this morning, man.
[24:32.860 --> 24:34.540]  But the plants are a lot tougher
[24:34.540 --> 24:35.900]  than we give them credit for.
[24:35.900 --> 24:38.700]  If they're outside plants and they've been given the build.
[24:38.700 --> 24:41.180]  Honestly, even indoors, plants are a lot tougher
[24:41.180 --> 24:42.020]  than we give them credit for.
[24:42.020 --> 24:45.860]  They've been growing for millions of years by themselves.
[24:45.860 --> 24:48.700]  We should give them a little bit more respect.
[24:48.700 --> 24:50.900]  They've been fighting for themselves for a long time,
[24:50.900 --> 24:53.380]  and I think that a lot of the problems
[24:53.420 --> 24:56.060]  that modern growers run into
[24:56.060 --> 24:59.700]  are because of the modern methods that they use.
[24:59.700 --> 25:00.780]  I agree with that.
[25:00.780 --> 25:04.660]  So it's these, in my opinion, this is just me speaking,
[25:04.660 --> 25:06.700]  but it's these synthetic systems
[25:06.700 --> 25:09.100]  and these synthetic environments.
[25:09.100 --> 25:10.380]  And when I say synthetic environment,
[25:10.380 --> 25:11.420]  I'm not meaning grow lights.
[25:11.420 --> 25:13.660]  I mean in synthetic pesticides.
[25:13.660 --> 25:14.700]  Right, yeah.
[25:14.700 --> 25:18.020]  But with these synthetic systems,
[25:18.020 --> 25:20.140]  that's what's creating this influx,
[25:20.140 --> 25:22.420]  these super hardy spider mites,
[25:22.420 --> 25:25.780]  these crazy resistant powdery mildew strains
[25:25.780 --> 25:29.420]  is because you're creating a feeding,
[25:29.420 --> 25:33.060]  your Colorado as a whole is creating a feeding ground
[25:33.060 --> 25:34.620]  for pest and disease.
[25:35.500 --> 25:40.500]  Every single dispensary is spraying the same thing.
[25:40.820 --> 25:42.260]  They're spraying neem oil.
[25:43.260 --> 25:47.860]  It's a very short list for a whole lot of plants.
[25:47.860 --> 25:50.380]  And they're not using these biological controls.
[25:50.380 --> 25:54.220]  So if you don't wanna run into problems,
[25:55.100 --> 25:58.260]  kick it, start using organic methods ASAP.
[26:00.060 --> 26:03.340]  And then, you can, these beneficial insects,
[26:03.340 --> 26:05.100]  they're not something that are hard to get.
[26:05.100 --> 26:07.260]  You can go to your local hydro store,
[26:07.260 --> 26:10.100]  go to topnotch.com, go to Copert,
[26:10.100 --> 26:11.620]  try to contact Dragonfly.
[26:11.620 --> 26:14.420]  Maybe you bug them enough, they'll get them for you.
[26:14.420 --> 26:17.220]  But you can get these mites.
[26:18.220 --> 26:19.820]  You don't have to spray.
[26:21.860 --> 26:25.100]  For example, we put these beneficial mites out.
[26:25.100 --> 26:28.260]  We top dress with neem and caranja.
[26:29.620 --> 26:31.580]  Top dress with diatomaceous earth.
[26:33.100 --> 26:35.620]  I foliar spray with natural mystic,
[26:35.620 --> 26:37.980]  which is a Dragonfly earth medicine product.
[26:37.980 --> 26:42.500]  So it's just like nettle, thistle, horsetail,
[26:42.500 --> 26:46.020]  lavender, petula, all sorts of shit.
[26:46.060 --> 26:47.020]  You can almost take a bite out of it.
[26:47.020 --> 26:48.660]  It's just fine. It smells wonderful.
[26:48.660 --> 26:50.820]  And yeah, I love to spray the greenhouse with it.
[26:50.820 --> 26:52.620]  But we spray natural mystic.
[26:52.620 --> 26:57.620]  So natural mystic, barley, and earthworm cast,
[26:58.060 --> 27:03.060]  or like a barley malted tea, seed tea, seed sprouted tea.
[27:04.380 --> 27:08.140]  But yeah, so barley, natural mystic, earthworm castings.
[27:08.140 --> 27:12.460]  That was a preventative that we were foliar spraying with.
[27:12.580 --> 27:17.580]  So, natural mystic, earthworm castings,
[27:18.780 --> 27:20.980]  and Bacillus thurgensis.
[27:20.980 --> 27:22.940]  That's great for the fungus gnats.
[27:22.940 --> 27:23.780]  Exactly.
[27:23.780 --> 27:25.220]  Yes, I wiped out some gnats with that.
[27:25.220 --> 27:29.780]  Yeah, so a lot of these things are just the same thing
[27:29.780 --> 27:30.980]  over and over again.
[27:30.980 --> 27:32.580]  Right, just different forms, different applications.
[27:32.580 --> 27:35.820]  Exactly, so right now on a weekly basis,
[27:35.820 --> 27:39.460]  we give them a weekly app of natural mystic,
[27:39.460 --> 27:42.380]  Rocky Mountain worm castings, and then sea crop.
[27:43.220 --> 27:44.860]  So yeah, you've heard of it.
[27:44.860 --> 27:48.980]  So yeah, trace minerals, natural mystic, worm castings,
[27:48.980 --> 27:51.580]  weekly basis, you'll be all right.
[27:51.580 --> 27:54.340]  That on top of just maintaining a healthy plant.
[27:54.340 --> 27:57.540]  I mean, like I was saying,
[27:57.540 --> 28:01.100]  the key is to just maintain the biological immune response
[28:01.100 --> 28:03.100]  through the entire growth cycle.
[28:03.100 --> 28:07.300]  So no synthetic nutrients, no pesticides, period.
[28:07.300 --> 28:09.700]  No bypassing natural processes.
[28:09.700 --> 28:11.740]  Don't put your plant in a bubble.
[28:11.780 --> 28:14.460]  I got that in exclamation points on both sides of it.
[28:14.460 --> 28:15.860]  Nobody would have known you were reading anything
[28:15.860 --> 28:17.180]  if you didn't tell us that.
[28:17.180 --> 28:18.780]  I just said it's very important.
[28:18.780 --> 28:23.780]  And then, let's see what else we got.
[28:25.100 --> 28:29.660]  So we went over the beneficials, Bacillus thurgensis.
[28:29.660 --> 28:32.140]  You know, I mean, the big thing
[28:32.140 --> 28:35.260]  with integrative pest management
[28:35.260 --> 28:39.180]  is maintaining a natural system
[28:39.220 --> 28:43.660]  that is gonna be looking, scouting, you know,
[28:43.660 --> 28:44.620]  stay observant.
[28:44.620 --> 28:46.860]  You need to maintain, you know,
[28:46.860 --> 28:49.380]  when you notice a bug problem, it's too late.
[28:49.380 --> 28:50.220]  Right.
[28:50.220 --> 28:51.620]  You know, stay on top of these things.
[28:51.620 --> 28:53.700]  Look out for yellowing leaves.
[28:53.700 --> 28:55.940]  You know, there's a reason sticky traps are yellow.
[28:55.940 --> 28:58.780]  Bugs are attracted to dying leaves.
[28:58.780 --> 29:01.300]  So keep all the yellow leaves out of your grow room.
[29:01.300 --> 29:03.380]  If you are an O'Toole gardener
[29:03.380 --> 29:08.140]  and you are somebody who top feeds with your leaves,
[29:08.180 --> 29:09.540]  know what you're doing.
[29:09.540 --> 29:11.140]  Top dress with, make sure you're top dressing
[29:11.140 --> 29:12.300]  with neem and Karasha.
[29:12.300 --> 29:14.820]  Make sure that you do have beneficial nematodes in there.
[29:14.820 --> 29:18.100]  Maybe you do treat with Bacillus thurgensis every now and then
[29:18.100 --> 29:21.260]  because otherwise you're gonna run into fungus gnats.
[29:21.260 --> 29:25.500]  So you just need to be a little bit more educated.
[29:25.500 --> 29:28.580]  That's how I got my fungus gnats, trying to go no-till.
[29:28.580 --> 29:30.300]  Yeah, I did it before too.
[29:30.300 --> 29:31.140]  It happened.
[29:31.140 --> 29:33.260]  I mean, you know, it is what it is,
[29:33.260 --> 29:35.300]  but you know, you learn these things.
[29:35.300 --> 29:36.620]  It's a process.
[29:36.620 --> 29:39.620]  And your plant will work itself out.
[29:41.260 --> 29:44.500]  You know, you'll end up with different sprig tails
[29:44.500 --> 29:49.460]  and different soil mites and shredders and anthropods.
[29:49.460 --> 29:52.460]  And it'll balance itself out.
[29:52.460 --> 29:55.180]  It's just nature does its thing.
[29:55.180 --> 29:56.700]  They're not welcome.
[29:56.700 --> 29:58.820]  You know, your plants are healthy.
[29:58.820 --> 29:59.780]  You treat them.
[29:59.780 --> 30:01.540]  You know, you keep doing what you're doing.
[30:01.540 --> 30:04.260]  You hit them with your Bacillus thurgensis,
[30:04.260 --> 30:07.020]  hit them with some diatomaceous.
[30:07.020 --> 30:09.340]  When you're so, my guy is at work.
[30:09.340 --> 30:11.460]  I can't fucking get this through their heads, man.
[30:11.460 --> 30:14.180]  The diatomaceous doesn't work when it's wet.
[30:14.180 --> 30:15.380]  For the love of God.
[30:16.660 --> 30:19.580]  It's gotta be abrasive and rough and coarse.
[30:19.580 --> 30:20.620]  Yes, yes.
[30:20.620 --> 30:23.900]  And that also goes for right after you water.
[30:23.900 --> 30:28.900]  So when the soil's still wet, don't put diatomaceous on it.
[30:29.300 --> 30:32.260]  Having a hard time getting these guys
[30:32.300 --> 30:34.300]  to put diatomaceous out correctly.
[30:34.300 --> 30:37.020]  And that goes back to just education is key.
[30:37.020 --> 30:40.500]  Know how to put your pest, you know, or I say pesticide,
[30:40.500 --> 30:42.500]  but how to put your products out correctly.
[30:42.500 --> 30:45.700]  You know, like I said, the CD8 came by our farm last week,
[30:45.700 --> 30:48.660]  but nothing on our farm is considered a pesticide
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.580]  or really even a fertilizer.
[30:50.580 --> 30:54.420]  You know, our diatomaceous earth is bought
[30:54.420 --> 30:57.740]  as an anti-caking agent for animal feed.
[30:57.740 --> 31:00.700]  We use food grade aloe and cocoa.
[31:00.740 --> 31:04.220]  Our neem and caranja is bought from, you know,
[31:04.220 --> 31:08.460]  Natural Selects or Rocky Mount Worm Company.
[31:08.460 --> 31:10.300]  So, and it's all food grade.
[31:10.300 --> 31:12.980]  So, you know, Jay only uses food grade material
[31:12.980 --> 31:14.140]  for his worms.
[31:14.140 --> 31:16.940]  So I'm only getting food grade material for the plants.
[31:16.940 --> 31:17.780]  That's awesome.
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.500]  It's good to know the patients are being taken care of, man.
[31:19.500 --> 31:20.340]  So awesome.
[31:20.340 --> 31:21.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:21.580 --> 31:24.060]  So a lot of what you covered, you said organic only.
[31:24.060 --> 31:26.660]  And then you said, if you're doing synthetic nutrients,
[31:26.660 --> 31:28.740]  you're gonna have to spray.
[31:28.740 --> 31:31.100]  So now here's where we're gonna have to talk about that one.
[31:31.100 --> 31:32.900]  The dreaded, I'm gonna have to spray.
[31:32.900 --> 31:35.180]  Let's say I walk in and I see freaking spider mites
[31:35.180 --> 31:36.020]  in my grow room.
[31:36.900 --> 31:38.900]  I've got a light infestation.
[31:38.900 --> 31:40.740]  I've never sprayed anything before.
[31:40.740 --> 31:42.820]  What is something we can spray that's not gonna do
[31:42.820 --> 31:46.420]  too much damage biologically to my planet
[31:46.420 --> 31:48.100]  and also to me when I smoke it
[31:48.100 --> 31:50.820]  and also not make my concentrates taste like shit?
[31:50.820 --> 31:54.860]  Yeah, so your first go-to would obviously be the neems.
[31:54.860 --> 31:55.700]  Okay.
[31:56.700 --> 31:59.820]  Then the first thing that you wanna do is throw down
[31:59.820 --> 32:04.820]  a nice tea of some neem, caranja, earthworm castings,
[32:04.860 --> 32:07.300]  just right drench into the root zone.
[32:07.300 --> 32:08.340]  Into the roots, okay.
[32:08.340 --> 32:11.420]  Yeah, or if you don't wanna make it, you can top dress.
[32:11.420 --> 32:13.220]  That's how we ran it at our farm.
[32:13.220 --> 32:14.060]  Okay.
[32:14.060 --> 32:16.940]  We just, and I say neem and caranja.
[32:16.940 --> 32:19.460]  It's because caranja's cheaper than neem.
[32:19.460 --> 32:22.580]  So you can cut it 50-50 and save a good bit of money.
[32:22.580 --> 32:23.420]  There you go.
[32:24.420 --> 32:27.380]  So yeah, I'd cut those in.
[32:27.380 --> 32:30.060]  Neem oil, wouldn't spray it after veg.
[32:30.060 --> 32:33.100]  Obviously, essential oils.
[32:33.100 --> 32:34.820]  You're gonna pay a whole bunch of money,
[32:34.820 --> 32:36.820]  but S&S does kinda work.
[32:36.820 --> 32:37.660]  Okay.
[32:38.660 --> 32:42.340]  Rosemary oil, they'll kill spider mite eggs on contact
[32:42.340 --> 32:44.420]  and it'll irritate spider mites,
[32:44.420 --> 32:47.660]  push them back a good bit and inhibit their growth.
[32:47.660 --> 32:50.740]  So essential oils, things like S&S 17.
[32:50.820 --> 32:53.980]  I'm not a huge fan of Ladybug Killer
[32:53.980 --> 32:56.540]  or Ed Rosenthal's Zero Tolerance.
[32:56.540 --> 32:58.540]  I haven't seen great, too good results,
[32:58.540 --> 32:59.780]  but S&S I have.
[32:59.780 --> 33:01.180]  It's extremely pricey.
[33:01.180 --> 33:02.420]  You can make it yourself.
[33:02.420 --> 33:05.660]  It's rose 90, it's like 9% rosemary
[33:05.660 --> 33:08.100]  or 2% rosemary oil or something like that.
[33:08.100 --> 33:10.780]  So you could make it if you feel like
[33:10.780 --> 33:12.380]  being a little experimental.
[33:12.380 --> 33:14.980]  I have cooked some plants before with essential oils.
[33:14.980 --> 33:15.820]  Oh yeah.
[33:15.820 --> 33:16.980]  So they're extremely volatile.
[33:16.980 --> 33:17.820]  Right.
[33:17.820 --> 33:19.220]  You gotta be really careful.
[33:19.220 --> 33:23.460]  Outside of that, I would go to biologicals.
[33:23.460 --> 33:25.140]  Would be my next step.
[33:25.140 --> 33:29.620]  So that's when I would step into the predatory mites.
[33:29.620 --> 33:33.740]  Ladybugs, ladybugs don't eat spider mites.
[33:33.740 --> 33:37.000]  Ladybugs eat larger insects like aphids, things like that.
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.300]  It's actually the ladybug larva that eat the spider mites.
[33:40.300 --> 33:41.140]  Okay.
[33:41.140 --> 33:42.780]  So you need to bring them in
[33:42.780 --> 33:46.620]  and then give them enough time to lower the lights,
[33:46.620 --> 33:48.620]  light some candles, play some music,
[33:49.060 --> 33:51.020]  and then have them make babies all over your garden.
[33:51.020 --> 33:52.140]  Need a little ladybug orgy?
[33:52.140 --> 33:53.180]  Hey, there you go, dude.
[33:53.180 --> 33:55.860]  Just woodstocking in your garden.
[33:55.860 --> 33:59.140]  And their ladybugs, their larva will emerge,
[33:59.140 --> 33:59.980]  little alligator larva,
[33:59.980 --> 34:03.100]  and then those will eat soft-bodied insects,
[34:03.100 --> 34:05.420]  smaller soft-bodied insects, mites, things like that.
[34:05.420 --> 34:06.260]  Okay.
[34:06.260 --> 34:09.120]  So you can start implementing that system.
[34:10.460 --> 34:13.580]  Defoliating, taking off the infected areas.
[34:13.580 --> 34:15.860]  People overlook that so much.
[34:15.860 --> 34:17.780]  I can't tell you how many times
[34:17.820 --> 34:19.620]  I've gone to an infected garden
[34:19.620 --> 34:24.300]  and seen stippled plants and these things look just fucked.
[34:24.300 --> 34:26.100]  And my first question is,
[34:26.100 --> 34:28.700]  why are these leaves still on here?
[34:28.700 --> 34:31.700]  So you know, the spider mites are still on your plants, man.
[34:31.700 --> 34:36.700]  So remove that vegetation unless it's absolutely needed.
[34:38.740 --> 34:40.540]  I'm learning a lot from plants
[34:40.540 --> 34:43.020]  running on a larger scale like I am.
[34:43.020 --> 34:44.980]  Plants can take a lot.
[34:44.980 --> 34:47.700]  And if you need to thin your plant out
[34:48.580 --> 34:52.260]  to two tops from a fucking 12 top five gallon,
[34:52.260 --> 34:53.940]  it's gonna survive.
[34:53.940 --> 34:56.140]  And if all you're trying to,
[34:56.140 --> 34:58.340]  and that's maybe something that you need to assess too.
[34:58.340 --> 35:00.260]  So when you walk into your garden
[35:00.260 --> 35:02.140]  and you find the spider mite problem,
[35:02.140 --> 35:03.740]  which you know, maybe the first thing
[35:03.740 --> 35:06.100]  that you really need to do is think about
[35:06.100 --> 35:08.460]  what is this plant's intention?
[35:08.460 --> 35:11.100]  Is it getting ready to be flowered?
[35:11.100 --> 35:12.200]  Can I just kill it?
[35:13.100 --> 35:14.780]  Is it too much right now for you?
[35:14.780 --> 35:16.820]  You know, if perfect world,
[35:16.820 --> 35:18.340]  I would tell you to throw the plant away.
[35:18.340 --> 35:19.180]  Yeah, that's it.
[35:19.180 --> 35:20.020]  You know?
[35:20.020 --> 35:20.840]  Yeah.
[35:20.840 --> 35:22.880]  And maybe you can't, maybe you're too far in.
[35:22.880 --> 35:25.260]  You've already got too much invested growing cycle.
[35:25.260 --> 35:27.220]  And that's when I'd say, you know, neem oils
[35:27.220 --> 35:29.780]  and then the essential oils and the predator,
[35:29.780 --> 35:32.580]  you know, the predatorials and things like that.
[35:32.580 --> 35:34.740]  By the time you notice it's usually too late.
[35:34.740 --> 35:37.540]  Unless you can, you know,
[35:37.540 --> 35:40.020]  veg for another four weeks, cut her back,
[35:40.020 --> 35:44.220]  take clones off of that and inoculate the clones.
[35:44.220 --> 35:45.920]  That's usually what I try to do
[35:45.920 --> 35:47.360]  if I find something's too out of control.
[35:47.360 --> 35:49.160]  If I, I do consulting as well.
[35:49.160 --> 35:50.720]  And if I go to someone's grow and I can see
[35:50.720 --> 35:52.680]  that their mother plant or their veg plant
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.740]  has gotten too far, I just say, take clones, bro.
[35:54.740 --> 35:56.600]  We can kill, you know, bugs on clones
[35:56.600 --> 35:58.040]  and get rid of those big ass plants.
[35:58.040 --> 35:59.480]  Less vegetation, like you were saying,
[35:59.480 --> 36:00.880]  around to keep all those bugs around.
[36:00.880 --> 36:03.060]  So cut some clones, clean the room, start fresh.
[36:03.060 --> 36:04.680]  That may be your only option sometimes.
[36:04.680 --> 36:05.520]  Yeah.
[36:05.520 --> 36:08.340]  And you know, and a lot of people don't,
[36:08.340 --> 36:13.340]  they don't understand start fresh means get off your ass,
[36:13.500 --> 36:17.620]  scrub your room, change your filters.
[36:17.620 --> 36:21.060]  You got Panda film, go and buy some new rolls.
[36:22.260 --> 36:24.660]  You're not, you don't just pull your plants out.
[36:24.660 --> 36:28.580]  These, the spider mites got in there two ways.
[36:28.580 --> 36:31.380]  They got in there because you didn't change your clothes
[36:31.380 --> 36:34.620]  and you walked into an effective garden and brought them in
[36:34.620 --> 36:36.820]  or somebody you know brought them in.
[36:36.820 --> 36:41.740]  Or the second option is they brought themselves in.
[36:41.740 --> 36:44.460]  And I, you know, have a agricultural background.
[36:44.460 --> 36:47.340]  I've worked in a cucumber, you know,
[36:47.340 --> 36:49.860]  grown cucumbers, tomatoes, and falcon
[36:49.860 --> 36:53.180]  up in Northern or Western or Eastern Colorado.
[36:53.180 --> 36:54.260]  I'm all fucked up.
[36:54.260 --> 36:56.180]  But no, so like when we would do,
[36:56.180 --> 36:57.980]  I was in charge of IPM there
[36:57.980 --> 36:59.820]  and we would do scouting programs.
[36:59.820 --> 37:01.980]  So every morning you would walk out
[37:01.980 --> 37:04.460]  with your magnifying glass and your clipboard
[37:04.460 --> 37:06.140]  with your map of the greenhouse
[37:06.140 --> 37:08.300]  and it would have your rows marked out.
[37:08.300 --> 37:11.200]  And you would be surprised to see that, you know,
[37:11.600 --> 37:14.600]  we would find stippling and we would mark them on the map
[37:14.600 --> 37:16.540]  as we found stippling in these rows.
[37:16.540 --> 37:17.920]  Once we would go through all these rows,
[37:17.920 --> 37:20.080]  you could follow this map back
[37:20.080 --> 37:22.600]  to a cracked seal in the greenhouse.
[37:22.600 --> 37:23.760]  To where there was a broken,
[37:23.760 --> 37:25.000]  cause it was a glass greenhouse,
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.160]  to a broken pane where weeds had grown through.
[37:28.160 --> 37:30.400]  Same thing in your grow room.
[37:30.400 --> 37:32.680]  You'll notice that the spider mites
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.280]  in the back corner of your room, maybe it's not sealed.
[37:36.280 --> 37:38.120]  You know, you might have a draft back there.
[37:38.120 --> 37:40.360]  Maybe that's where your window is
[37:40.360 --> 37:42.840]  and you put a piece of plywood over it with panda film
[37:42.840 --> 37:44.400]  cause you thought that was gonna be enough to cover it
[37:44.400 --> 37:46.360]  and you didn't weather seal it.
[37:46.360 --> 37:48.520]  But that is, you know,
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.960]  that's how spider mites get into your grow room.
[37:50.960 --> 37:55.960]  They, it's an evolutionary thing to wanna survive.
[37:56.360 --> 37:59.880]  And in Colorado, when it's four degrees outside
[37:59.880 --> 38:03.100]  and you have a 90, you know, a 75 degree grow room,
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.480]  that's where I'm going, man.
[38:05.480 --> 38:07.960]  Like fuck your plants.
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.520]  Vacation time in there, bro.
[38:10.520 --> 38:12.040]  Yeah, go get warm, go snuggle.
[38:12.040 --> 38:13.280]  That's what I've been doing during this winter
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.000]  is hiding in a grow room.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.480]  So you nailed something.
[38:16.480 --> 38:18.640]  You nailed two things off the list I had written down there
[38:18.640 --> 38:21.680]  is your environment will contribute to your bugs heavily.
[38:21.680 --> 38:23.480]  And also you bring those bugs in.
[38:23.480 --> 38:25.160]  So I get to cross off two things on the list
[38:25.160 --> 38:26.000]  without even asking.
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.320]  That's amazing.
[38:27.320 --> 38:29.400]  You guys, if you're going from grow to grow,
[38:29.400 --> 38:30.680]  you're bringing something back with you
[38:30.680 --> 38:32.240]  every time you come and go.
[38:32.240 --> 38:33.080]  Yeah.
[38:33.520 --> 38:38.000]  If you really want to, you can buy a lab coat.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.240]  And that's something that I recommend to all of my growers,
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.360]  every consultation, every, we do it at my, you know,
[38:44.360 --> 38:46.760]  we'll do it at my work when we're not growing in a,
[38:46.760 --> 38:48.000]  you know, when we get back into
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.680]  more of an indoor environment.
[38:51.400 --> 38:52.840]  But yeah, get a lab coat.
[38:52.840 --> 38:54.080]  They don't cost anything.
[38:54.080 --> 38:56.520]  You can order them, get one for your home grow
[38:56.520 --> 38:58.800]  and put it on every time you go in your grow room.
[38:58.800 --> 39:00.360]  Hang up on the outside, right by the door.
[39:00.360 --> 39:01.200]  Exactly.
[39:01.200 --> 39:02.020]  Right next to your clipboard.
[39:02.020 --> 39:03.340]  Don't take it anywhere, you know,
[39:03.340 --> 39:05.140]  buy yourself a grow room, Tam.
[39:05.140 --> 39:06.580]  And then you don't wear that.
[39:08.220 --> 39:09.060]  What are you saying?
[39:09.060 --> 39:10.900]  That the dreadlocks might carry something in?
[39:10.900 --> 39:12.900]  They might get caught in a fan.
[39:12.900 --> 39:15.140]  Oh man, they get in everything if I don't keep them up.
[39:15.140 --> 39:17.500]  I have a hat specifically for the grow.
[39:17.500 --> 39:18.860]  And it's, you could probably collect
[39:18.860 --> 39:20.380]  a quarter gram of hash off of that thing.
[39:20.380 --> 39:22.220]  It's so sticky from walking through there.
[39:22.220 --> 39:23.700]  But yeah, you know, that's the key though,
[39:23.700 --> 39:25.820]  is just the contamination.
[39:25.820 --> 39:29.220]  It's as simple as not wearing the hoodie
[39:29.220 --> 39:32.180]  that you were hiking in, into your grow room.
[39:32.180 --> 39:34.900]  And you know, you laugh, but to a lot of people,
[39:36.020 --> 39:37.620]  they don't think about that stuff.
[39:37.620 --> 39:38.460]  Absolutely.
[39:38.460 --> 39:42.180]  You know, a lot of the guys at my work
[39:42.180 --> 39:46.200]  probably go home to their gardens right after my work.
[39:47.420 --> 39:49.340]  Do I worry about them bringing things back?
[39:49.340 --> 39:52.620]  Not really, because you know, they're an indoor grow
[39:52.620 --> 39:54.700]  bringing it to an outside environment.
[39:54.700 --> 39:58.100]  Now, you know, they should be really fucking worried
[39:58.100 --> 39:59.180]  about bringing something home,
[39:59.180 --> 40:02.400]  because if a spider mite comes into my garden,
[40:02.400 --> 40:04.180]  it's not gonna like it very much.
[40:04.180 --> 40:05.620]  It's gonna jump onto your shirt
[40:05.620 --> 40:08.580]  and try to come home with you and see what you got.
[40:08.580 --> 40:10.620]  But that's, you know, everybody's garden.
[40:10.620 --> 40:12.660]  So the next time you go over to your friend's house
[40:12.660 --> 40:14.960]  and his garden looks a lot better than yours,
[40:16.540 --> 40:18.080]  yeah, change.
[40:19.980 --> 40:21.180]  Yeah, before and after.
[40:21.180 --> 40:22.500]  Yeah.
[40:22.500 --> 40:23.340]  Do him a favor too.
[40:23.340 --> 40:26.060]  Don't be a dick and go visit your friend's grow
[40:26.060 --> 40:28.460]  after walking in the woods.
[40:28.460 --> 40:30.660]  Yeah, or don't tell me, don't come to my grow
[40:30.660 --> 40:31.900]  and be like, oh, your plants are great.
[40:31.900 --> 40:33.340]  I'm fighting spider mites.
[40:33.340 --> 40:34.820]  Don't come over if you got spider mites.
[40:34.820 --> 40:36.140]  Stay away from my garden.
[40:36.140 --> 40:36.980]  Exactly.
[40:36.980 --> 40:38.820]  Yeah, don't bring your powdery mildew to my grow.
[40:38.820 --> 40:39.660]  Yeah, and that's, you know,
[40:39.660 --> 40:44.500]  and that's another thing too is that the powdery mildews,
[40:44.500 --> 40:45.700]  you know, now that you said that,
[40:45.700 --> 40:49.980]  it's traded, you know, so frequently back and forth
[40:49.980 --> 40:51.380]  and within the community.
[40:51.380 --> 40:55.060]  And that's another one that when, you know,
[40:55.580 --> 41:00.300]  when I say kill and start over, I mean scorched earth.
[41:00.300 --> 41:04.220]  I mean, burn it down to the ground and build her back up.
[41:04.220 --> 41:05.660]  Yep, you have to sometimes.
[41:05.660 --> 41:08.740]  And you know, and honestly, when you,
[41:08.740 --> 41:12.380]  your grow room should be built with that capability.
[41:12.380 --> 41:16.100]  And if it's not, rebuild your grow room
[41:16.100 --> 41:19.100]  with either walls that you can clean with bleach
[41:19.100 --> 41:21.420]  or peroxide or whatever cleaning agent,
[41:21.420 --> 41:22.860]  or maybe it's panda film,
[41:22.860 --> 41:25.300]  but build it to where you can replace it
[41:25.300 --> 41:26.740]  in a frequent basis.
[41:26.740 --> 41:28.940]  You know, use spray foam insulation.
[41:28.940 --> 41:33.540]  Don't use shitty, you know, stuff wall insulation.
[41:33.540 --> 41:36.940]  Exactly, don't, you know, and if you can't afford,
[41:36.940 --> 41:39.700]  you know, these nicer options,
[41:39.700 --> 41:43.660]  panda film's not expensive if you build the room right.
[41:43.660 --> 41:46.540]  It's really expensive if you don't know what you're doing
[41:46.540 --> 41:49.380]  and you're running it 15 times around a month.
[41:49.380 --> 41:52.060]  But yeah, you know, build your rooms correctly.
[41:52.100 --> 41:53.900]  Make sure they're sealed.
[41:53.900 --> 41:55.340]  You know, pay attention to what you're doing.
[41:55.340 --> 41:57.260]  Yeah, that's one of the main keys to growing
[41:57.260 --> 41:58.100]  is a good room.
[41:58.100 --> 42:00.820]  And you only get that one shot to build it correct
[42:00.820 --> 42:02.940]  before you put your plants in there, so do it right.
[42:02.940 --> 42:05.460]  And like Sean said, try to replace that room.
[42:05.460 --> 42:07.300]  If you're using panda film,
[42:07.300 --> 42:08.580]  that's not gonna last forever, you guys.
[42:08.580 --> 42:10.540]  Take it down every like six months.
[42:10.540 --> 42:12.300]  Like every couple of harvests, pull that shit down.
[42:12.300 --> 42:14.300]  Clean behind it, get the shop back out.
[42:14.300 --> 42:15.660]  Clean out all the corners behind there
[42:15.660 --> 42:17.060]  where all that dust built up.
[42:17.060 --> 42:18.260]  Yeah, no. Clean it up.
[42:18.260 --> 42:19.420]  I don't know how many, like,
[42:19.420 --> 42:21.740]  especially home grows I've been to.
[42:22.420 --> 42:25.300]  I don't know why people like to build floors.
[42:25.300 --> 42:26.740]  It's the weirdest thing to me.
[42:26.740 --> 42:28.220]  I don't know how many grow rooms I've been in
[42:28.220 --> 42:31.700]  where people have floors built up just a couple inches.
[42:31.700 --> 42:34.140]  Or, you know, they'll have panda film rolled out
[42:34.140 --> 42:36.660]  on top of concrete for extra reflective.
[42:36.660 --> 42:39.700]  This is just creating more space for bugs,
[42:39.700 --> 42:42.020]  pests, mildew, and problems like that.
[42:42.020 --> 42:45.940]  So less is more in a grow room.
[42:46.860 --> 42:50.460]  If you can hold temp and you, you know,
[42:51.300 --> 42:52.780]  don't need to cover your floor,
[42:52.780 --> 42:54.940]  if you're growing in your garage,
[42:54.940 --> 42:57.220]  utilize that concrete floor, man.
[42:57.220 --> 43:00.540]  You know, it's nice, it's clean, it can be cleaned easily.
[43:00.540 --> 43:01.380]  Yeah.
[43:01.380 --> 43:03.100]  You know, drop you some two by fours
[43:03.100 --> 43:04.820]  and caulk it to the floor.
[43:04.820 --> 43:07.460]  Go get some great stuff foam, insulate it.
[43:07.460 --> 43:09.100]  No bugs are gonna crawl through that.
[43:09.100 --> 43:10.940]  But just little steps through,
[43:10.940 --> 43:13.860]  like that's what's gonna prevent, you know,
[43:13.860 --> 43:16.420]  for you from having a massive infestation.
[43:16.420 --> 43:17.860]  I like that you said once you see it,
[43:17.860 --> 43:19.540]  it's probably too late.
[43:20.100 --> 43:22.380]  That's something that people are probably not aware of,
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.940]  especially if you're in flower.
[43:23.940 --> 43:24.780]  If you're in flower,
[43:24.780 --> 43:26.140]  you just gotta start pulling off leaves
[43:26.140 --> 43:27.140]  and ride it through.
[43:27.140 --> 43:31.620]  Yes, and I can't tell you how many times I've had to do it.
[43:31.620 --> 43:34.540]  You know, I mean, you wanna, it's,
[43:34.540 --> 43:36.620]  and spider mites can be dealt with.
[43:36.620 --> 43:38.940]  They can be, you can get rid of them.
[43:38.940 --> 43:40.540]  It's not the end of the world.
[43:40.540 --> 43:42.500]  And you don't have to kill your plants.
[43:43.780 --> 43:44.860]  You know, but like you said,
[43:44.860 --> 43:47.820]  if you're getting ready to go into flower
[43:47.860 --> 43:50.580]  and you see stippling, don't flower.
[43:50.580 --> 43:52.180]  Don't be that guy.
[43:52.180 --> 43:54.420]  You know, because when you find yourself
[43:54.420 --> 43:55.860]  with that decision of like,
[43:55.860 --> 43:59.700]  oh man, am I gonna have to spray in week four with neem oil?
[43:59.700 --> 44:01.700]  You're gonna have to spray in week four with neem oil
[44:01.700 --> 44:03.420]  because you put yourself in that position.
[44:03.420 --> 44:04.260]  Because by week six,
[44:04.260 --> 44:06.580]  you're just gonna have crispy ass leaves and no bugs.
[44:06.580 --> 44:08.140]  And you know, but like, you know,
[44:08.140 --> 44:09.460]  but what was worse is,
[44:09.460 --> 44:11.420]  or even if you were a week into flower,
[44:11.420 --> 44:13.020]  what would have been worse?
[44:13.020 --> 44:15.380]  Reverting back to veg?
[44:15.380 --> 44:19.620]  Or, you know, holding on to this spider mite infestation
[44:19.620 --> 44:20.860]  and having to ride it through
[44:20.860 --> 44:23.300]  and potentially losing everything.
[44:23.300 --> 44:25.700]  Yeah, it's another month of power bills
[44:25.700 --> 44:28.860]  versus losing your entire harvest.
[44:28.860 --> 44:30.540]  So, you know, you gotta weigh your options on.
[44:30.540 --> 44:33.180]  That goes back to really think about your situation.
[44:33.180 --> 44:34.540]  What are these plants for?
[44:36.060 --> 44:36.900]  True that.
[44:36.900 --> 44:38.180]  Yeah, are you growing your own personal medicine
[44:38.180 --> 44:39.420]  or you got a crop out there
[44:39.420 --> 44:40.660]  that you're trying to make some bank on?
[44:40.660 --> 44:41.740]  You're trying to buy that new car?
[44:41.740 --> 44:42.820]  Yeah, is it a dispensary?
[44:42.820 --> 44:43.820]  Is it not your plants?
[44:43.820 --> 44:45.140]  Is it somebody else's money?
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.460]  I mean, you know, that's a stress
[44:47.460 --> 44:49.900]  that people don't realize exists out there.
[44:49.900 --> 44:52.940]  You know, me and you both, we grow personally and stuff,
[44:52.940 --> 44:57.020]  but we manage other people's gardens.
[44:57.020 --> 44:58.300]  I mean, they're our gardens,
[44:58.300 --> 45:00.140]  but it's other people's money ultimately.
[45:00.140 --> 45:01.660]  Absolutely, somebody else's chunk.
[45:01.660 --> 45:03.740]  So what do you do in that situation?
[45:03.740 --> 45:05.660]  You know, how do you as a grower
[45:05.660 --> 45:08.740]  come to the decision of to cull the plant?
[45:08.740 --> 45:12.220]  You know, like, yeah, I mean,
[45:13.020 --> 45:16.100]  that's the daily decisions that we have to make.
[45:16.100 --> 45:19.540]  And if we can do it, you can do it at your home.
[45:19.540 --> 45:20.380]  Oh, yeah.
[45:20.380 --> 45:23.020]  You know, I mean, but that's what you really,
[45:23.020 --> 45:25.060]  people have to start thinking about things
[45:25.060 --> 45:26.180]  a lot differently.
[45:26.180 --> 45:28.620]  I meet a lot of people and it's,
[45:28.620 --> 45:30.380]  I got spider mites, what can I spray?
[45:30.380 --> 45:32.660]  I got powdery mildew, what can I spray?
[45:32.660 --> 45:34.060]  It's not what can you spray,
[45:34.060 --> 45:35.980]  it's what should I have sprayed?
[45:35.980 --> 45:38.220]  You know, you should be spraying ahead of time.
[45:38.220 --> 45:41.060]  Stay on top of these foliars, compost tea foliars.
[45:41.060 --> 45:42.420]  Yeah.
[45:42.420 --> 45:45.620]  You do compost tea foliar sprays on a regular basis
[45:45.620 --> 45:49.900]  along with beneficial insects, mites, nematodes,
[45:49.900 --> 45:51.860]  you're in a top dress with diatomaceous earth,
[45:51.860 --> 45:53.820]  neem and corangea.
[45:53.820 --> 45:56.860]  I don't see you having a pest problem, you know?
[45:56.860 --> 46:00.460]  And then in my greenhouse, you know, like I was saying,
[46:00.460 --> 46:03.100]  we thought that we had a broad mite infestation.
[46:03.100 --> 46:04.700]  Actually turned out that it was,
[46:05.820 --> 46:07.820]  another problem was a water issue
[46:07.820 --> 46:09.500]  because our well had collapsed.
[46:09.500 --> 46:11.780]  We had brought water from another well
[46:11.780 --> 46:13.180]  at a different location
[46:14.180 --> 46:16.860]  and did the very foolish thing of not
[46:16.860 --> 46:18.820]  fully checking the water's chemistry
[46:18.820 --> 46:20.620]  before we ran it through an RO.
[46:21.700 --> 46:24.460]  Ended up putting high levels of salt in the plants.
[46:24.460 --> 46:28.660]  But I'm a firm believer that it was the soil,
[46:28.660 --> 46:31.020]  the environment and the overall health.
[46:31.020 --> 46:33.700]  It was that natural immune response
[46:33.700 --> 46:35.340]  that pushed me out of it.
[46:35.340 --> 46:37.780]  You know, if I was in cocoa,
[46:37.780 --> 46:39.380]  growing with mills
[46:39.380 --> 46:41.740]  and I put that much salt on my plants.
[46:41.740 --> 46:42.740]  It would have been over.
[46:42.740 --> 46:45.860]  The instantly, even like a pepper sprayed.
[46:45.860 --> 46:47.460]  They've been screaming.
[46:47.460 --> 46:51.740]  But we wrote it out and you can go to my Instagram,
[46:51.740 --> 46:54.500]  you know, or go to Sandsaw CBD Instagram
[46:54.500 --> 46:58.780]  and look at this greenhouse filled with beautiful greenery.
[46:58.780 --> 47:03.780]  I mean, it was 3000 square foot of just canopy.
[47:03.860 --> 47:04.700]  Lush canopy.
[47:04.700 --> 47:06.420]  I was checking out your security cameras earlier
[47:06.420 --> 47:07.620]  and that shit looks good, bro.
[47:08.460 --> 47:09.860]  Nice and organized, super clean.
[47:09.860 --> 47:11.020]  That's another thing you guys,
[47:11.020 --> 47:12.580]  you don't need shit in your grow room
[47:12.580 --> 47:13.900]  that doesn't need to be in your grow room.
[47:13.900 --> 47:16.380]  Don't keep your broom and your dustpan.
[47:16.380 --> 47:17.820]  Get those out of there.
[47:17.820 --> 47:19.460]  Your gloves, take those out of there.
[47:19.460 --> 47:20.580]  Your hat, take that out.
[47:20.580 --> 47:22.980]  None of that extra crap needs to be in the grow room.
[47:22.980 --> 47:25.460]  Maybe the only accessory I see that you can use in there
[47:25.460 --> 47:27.940]  is a little iPod dock so you can jam some music.
[47:27.940 --> 47:29.220]  Anything else, get it out of there.
[47:29.220 --> 47:34.220]  Speaking of which, DeWalt makes an amazing grow room radio.
[47:34.500 --> 47:38.180]  It is, yeah, you go to Lowe's and they're like 90 bucks,
[47:38.180 --> 47:41.540]  but they're Bluetooth and waterproof and kick proof.
[47:41.540 --> 47:42.380]  There you go.
[47:42.380 --> 47:43.940]  I can't tell, I'm punting my shit
[47:43.940 --> 47:45.980]  across the room all the time, man.
[47:45.980 --> 47:50.980]  Yeah, the little Bluetooth speaker at the grow
[47:51.180 --> 47:52.180]  definitely gets infused.
[47:52.180 --> 47:54.460]  It falls off the table, it gets shit spilled on it.
[47:54.460 --> 47:55.740]  DeWalt that shit, man.
[47:55.740 --> 47:56.860]  All right, there we go, you guys.
[47:56.860 --> 48:00.340]  Big shout out to Lowe's and DeWalt for their iPod dock.
[48:00.340 --> 48:02.340]  It's the little things in life.
[48:03.060 --> 48:04.980]  Make yourself comfortable in your grow room.
[48:04.980 --> 48:07.100]  Your plants are only gonna be as happy as you are.
[48:07.100 --> 48:07.940]  That's the truth.
[48:07.940 --> 48:11.180]  If you're miserable, if you go into your grow room
[48:11.180 --> 48:12.980]  and you're looking at it as work
[48:12.980 --> 48:16.900]  and you think of it as I gotta get in here,
[48:16.900 --> 48:19.500]  I gotta check these plants and I gotta hurry up and water
[48:19.500 --> 48:22.020]  so I can get out of here and I can go and do this,
[48:22.020 --> 48:26.500]  stop and quit growing because that's the wrong approach.
[48:26.500 --> 48:28.740]  And that's when you're gonna run into these,
[48:28.740 --> 48:30.660]  you're gonna miss the stippling
[48:30.660 --> 48:32.820]  because you're not gonna have stippling
[48:32.820 --> 48:34.540]  if you're staying on top of it
[48:34.540 --> 48:36.660]  and you're checking your environment on a regular basis
[48:36.660 --> 48:38.540]  and you know that there's no air leaks
[48:38.540 --> 48:41.660]  or ventilation issues.
[48:41.660 --> 48:43.500]  And if you're staying on top of your maintenance
[48:43.500 --> 48:45.060]  and you're pulling your yellow leaves
[48:45.060 --> 48:47.580]  and you're cleaning up the inside of the plants
[48:47.580 --> 48:49.340]  so they've got the air flow
[48:49.340 --> 48:51.180]  and you don't have to worry about the mildew.
[48:51.180 --> 48:54.940]  I met with the guy today was telling me
[48:54.940 --> 48:57.900]  that one of their greenhouses, they've got powdery mildew.
[48:58.740 --> 49:03.740]  It is February 3rd in Colorado.
[49:05.140 --> 49:10.140]  It was four degrees with like 0% humidity
[49:11.420 --> 49:13.620]  and these motherfuckers got powdery mildew.
[49:14.540 --> 49:16.020]  Why?
[49:16.020 --> 49:17.940]  Because they were growing with synthetics.
[49:17.940 --> 49:19.540]  They didn't clean their plants.
[49:19.540 --> 49:21.180]  It was operator error.
[49:21.180 --> 49:23.860]  You know, it's not plant error.
[49:23.900 --> 49:26.140]  You know, and that's something that,
[49:27.220 --> 49:31.020]  don't blame yourself and don't blame other people
[49:31.020 --> 49:34.300]  because that's really not the way to view a pest problem.
[49:36.380 --> 49:39.380]  You should always view it as what can you do to improve it.
[49:39.380 --> 49:42.420]  So if your buddy gives you spider mites,
[49:43.420 --> 49:45.540]  don't punch him in the face
[49:45.540 --> 49:48.100]  because he's dealing with the problems too.
[49:48.100 --> 49:52.340]  You know, but now, you know, if honestly though,
[49:52.340 --> 49:55.540]  if you get spider mites from your buddy,
[49:55.540 --> 49:58.460]  then you're kind of a dumb ass for bringing a plant in
[49:58.460 --> 50:00.020]  without checking it for spider mites.
[50:00.020 --> 50:03.100]  And that goes back to you just being educated enough
[50:03.100 --> 50:04.700]  to identify what stippling is,
[50:04.700 --> 50:06.500]  to know what spider mite eggs look like,
[50:06.500 --> 50:09.140]  to know how to use a magnifying glass.
[50:11.660 --> 50:13.060]  There's so much information.
[50:13.060 --> 50:15.500]  Like when me and you were learning, we had to buy books,
[50:15.500 --> 50:18.220]  man, I remember going to Barnes and Nobles,
[50:18.220 --> 50:22.540]  like trying to buy, you know, books about growing weed.
[50:22.540 --> 50:24.140]  And it was a difficult experience.
[50:24.140 --> 50:25.980]  You had to ask for them, they didn't have them out.
[50:25.980 --> 50:26.820]  It was so weird.
[50:26.820 --> 50:30.060]  And nowadays I can go to 50 different webs.
[50:30.060 --> 50:32.460]  I can Google everything.
[50:32.460 --> 50:33.460]  I mean, it's ruined.
[50:33.460 --> 50:34.900]  You can listen to a podcast.
[50:34.900 --> 50:36.420]  You can drive down the street
[50:36.420 --> 50:38.220]  and absorb massive information.
[50:38.220 --> 50:40.820]  But that's the thing is just, I don't understand.
[50:40.820 --> 50:42.820]  You shouldn't be running into these problems
[50:42.820 --> 50:44.540]  with all of this information available.
[50:44.540 --> 50:45.380]  Absolutely.
[50:45.380 --> 50:46.940]  The resources are out there.
[50:49.060 --> 50:50.700]  Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
[50:50.700 --> 50:52.540]  Rocky Mountain Earthworm Company.
[50:52.540 --> 50:56.820]  Those guys come through for me time and time again.
[50:57.900 --> 51:00.380]  Jace Castings, not just as Castings,
[51:00.380 --> 51:05.380]  but Aloe, Coco, Sea Crop, OG BioR, Earth Kelp.
[51:05.580 --> 51:08.740]  This, everything that we can source through him,
[51:08.740 --> 51:12.740]  Neem, Karanja, Kelp, he's always hooking it up.
[51:12.740 --> 51:14.820]  Dragonfly, the same way.
[51:15.980 --> 51:17.220]  And then, you know, the same thing,
[51:17.540 --> 51:21.620]  follow us on our farm, SandSol CBD, me at King Cola.
[51:21.620 --> 51:24.100]  I'm not afraid to tell you I got spider mites.
[51:24.100 --> 51:26.620]  You know, I'll post it if I get powdery mildew.
[51:27.980 --> 51:29.780]  You know, we were dealing with algae blooms
[51:29.780 --> 51:32.060]  on our root riot.
[51:32.060 --> 51:34.540]  We had algae growing on root riot plugs.
[51:34.540 --> 51:36.620]  That's because the temperature fluctuation,
[51:36.620 --> 51:39.060]  our air temp was staying warm enough,
[51:39.060 --> 51:40.740]  but the cube temp was dropping.
[51:40.740 --> 51:41.580]  Okay.
[51:41.580 --> 51:45.220]  I can, they don't make thermometers to check cube temp.
[51:45.260 --> 51:48.420]  But, you know, so we were basically
[51:48.420 --> 51:50.260]  keeping the cubes too cold.
[51:50.260 --> 51:53.740]  We had our, when we clone, we'll do like
[51:55.140 --> 52:00.140]  Aloe, Coco, or I'm sorry, Aloe, Pro-Tech, and Full Power.
[52:01.140 --> 52:02.700]  And then we'll usually foliar spray
[52:02.700 --> 52:04.660]  with like a sea crop or a compost tea.
[52:04.660 --> 52:07.660]  But basically, we had some nutrient content
[52:07.660 --> 52:08.980]  and the plants wouldn't take it
[52:08.980 --> 52:11.460]  because roots never develop because it was too cold.
[52:11.460 --> 52:13.620]  The plants didn't die.
[52:13.660 --> 52:15.220]  But, you know, there was nutrient content,
[52:15.220 --> 52:17.820]  excess sunlight, algae bloom.
[52:17.820 --> 52:21.900]  You know, but yeah, you just gotta live and you learn, man.
[52:21.900 --> 52:23.300]  Like you had a little pond happening.
[52:23.300 --> 52:24.140]  Exactly.
[52:24.140 --> 52:24.980]  Yeah.
[52:24.980 --> 52:25.820]  Put some koi fish in there.
[52:25.820 --> 52:28.020]  So yeah, now we're running easy cloners.
[52:28.020 --> 52:29.020]  I love an easy cloner.
[52:29.020 --> 52:30.140]  Shout out to the easy cloners.
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.580]  Yeah, it's wonderful.
[52:31.580 --> 52:33.580]  But indoors, in micro room,
[52:33.580 --> 52:36.660]  at three, you know, anywhere else that we've run it,
[52:36.660 --> 52:39.900]  we do the same cloning method over and over again,
[52:39.900 --> 52:44.660]  hitting, you know, 90%, you know, clone rates,
[52:44.660 --> 52:46.460]  bringing them into this greenhouse.
[52:47.420 --> 52:52.420]  I have clones that aren't dead, aren't rooted,
[52:52.740 --> 52:54.420]  still green and lush.
[52:54.420 --> 52:56.220]  They were taken almost a month ago.
[52:56.220 --> 52:57.220]  Wow.
[52:57.220 --> 52:59.220]  And the reason I haven't thrown them
[52:59.220 --> 53:01.820]  is because I'm really anxious to see what happens.
[53:01.820 --> 53:04.180]  Dude, they're gonna live or die.
[53:04.180 --> 53:05.980]  Dude, I've got plants.
[53:05.980 --> 53:09.860]  I've got plants that I've taken clones off of
[53:09.860 --> 53:12.380]  from like clones that I took with, you know,
[53:12.380 --> 53:13.260]  I took that clone.
[53:13.260 --> 53:14.180]  Right.
[53:14.180 --> 53:18.180]  Yeah, but so, you know, roll with the punches.
[53:18.180 --> 53:20.780]  You know, information is key.
[53:20.780 --> 53:21.860]  Preventative is key.
[53:21.860 --> 53:23.100]  Or preventative is key.
[53:23.100 --> 53:25.220]  And information is a big part of that.
[53:25.220 --> 53:27.460]  Preventative is know what you're doing.
[53:27.460 --> 53:30.300]  And don't go and concede it and cocky,
[53:30.300 --> 53:31.140]  like you know what you're doing,
[53:31.140 --> 53:32.580]  but really do your research.
[53:32.580 --> 53:33.860]  Yeah.
[53:33.860 --> 53:35.780]  Spend some time, you know,
[53:35.780 --> 53:37.540]  looking at what spider mites looks like.
[53:37.540 --> 53:40.180]  If you hear that your friend has spider mites,
[53:41.540 --> 53:43.780]  go and for the love of God,
[53:44.660 --> 53:46.340]  find an old t-shirt or something,
[53:46.340 --> 53:49.940]  but volunteer to go over to his house with a microscope.
[53:49.940 --> 53:52.580]  Look and see what the spider mite damage looks like.
[53:52.580 --> 53:55.140]  Because you're not gonna know unless you look.
[53:56.100 --> 53:58.020]  But that's what I think is so important
[53:58.020 --> 54:00.420]  is the education.
[54:00.420 --> 54:01.260]  Yeah, go see it.
[54:01.260 --> 54:02.100]  Is that you know what you're looking for.
[54:02.100 --> 54:02.940]  Yeah.
[54:02.940 --> 54:04.580]  And if you can become familiar with stippling,
[54:04.580 --> 54:07.500]  you can become familiar with a fungus,
[54:07.500 --> 54:08.340]  or you know,
[54:08.340 --> 54:09.180]  the difference between a fungus gnat
[54:09.180 --> 54:10.420]  and a flying root aphid.
[54:10.420 --> 54:13.340]  If you can become familiar with a thrip or a whitefly.
[54:13.340 --> 54:14.180]  Or whiteflies.
[54:14.180 --> 54:15.020]  Yeah, you know,
[54:15.020 --> 54:15.860]  then people,
[54:15.860 --> 54:18.580]  these small time guys aren't familiar with it.
[54:18.580 --> 54:19.420]  You know,
[54:19.420 --> 54:20.260]  me and you run into it
[54:20.260 --> 54:22.540]  because we're growing hundreds and thousands
[54:22.540 --> 54:23.860]  of these plants.
[54:23.860 --> 54:26.380]  But when you're in your home grow
[54:26.380 --> 54:27.660]  and you run into these problems,
[54:27.660 --> 54:28.500]  and you will,
[54:28.500 --> 54:30.460]  you're not perfect.
[54:30.460 --> 54:31.740]  It happens.
[54:31.740 --> 54:33.660]  But you stop.
[54:34.860 --> 54:35.700]  You know,
[54:35.700 --> 54:37.660]  evaluate the situation.
[54:37.660 --> 54:38.900]  And don't panic.
[54:38.900 --> 54:39.740]  Exactly,
[54:39.740 --> 54:40.580]  educate yourself.
[54:40.580 --> 54:41.420]  You know,
[54:41.420 --> 54:43.340]  don't run down to the grow store
[54:43.340 --> 54:44.700]  and buy a chemical
[54:44.700 --> 54:46.020]  and spray your plant.
[54:46.020 --> 54:49.780]  If you've never used a synthetic nutrient,
[54:49.780 --> 54:50.660]  if you haven't,
[54:50.660 --> 54:51.500]  or I mean,
[54:51.500 --> 54:52.340]  even if you have,
[54:52.340 --> 54:53.460]  so if,
[54:53.460 --> 54:55.540]  as long as you haven't sprayed those systemics
[54:55.540 --> 54:56.940]  is really the big thing.
[54:57.780 --> 54:58.780]  If you're in veg
[54:58.780 --> 55:01.100]  and you hit it with some advanced newts
[55:01.580 --> 55:02.860]  or something like that,
[55:04.420 --> 55:05.700]  stop,
[55:05.700 --> 55:07.460]  go and hit it with the compost tea,
[55:07.460 --> 55:09.380]  top dress with some earthworm castings,
[55:09.380 --> 55:11.780]  try to kickstart that biological system,
[55:12.860 --> 55:14.820]  implement some beneficials,
[55:14.820 --> 55:16.700]  start full you're spraying,
[55:16.700 --> 55:19.020]  and then just ride it out,
[55:19.020 --> 55:20.020]  like nature intended.
[55:20.020 --> 55:20.940]  And they won't want to hang out.
[55:20.940 --> 55:21.780]  They'll get mad.
[55:21.780 --> 55:22.620]  Exactly.
[55:22.620 --> 55:23.460]  The bugs will leave.
[55:23.460 --> 55:24.500]  They'll jump on your buddies
[55:24.500 --> 55:25.460]  and go home to their house.
[55:25.460 --> 55:26.300]  There you go.
[55:26.300 --> 55:27.620]  I'll run out of the bottom of the pots.
[55:27.620 --> 55:29.140]  Like no.
[55:29.140 --> 55:30.220]  Yeah.
[55:30.220 --> 55:32.820]  So I don't think I would be as experienced
[55:32.820 --> 55:33.660]  of a gardener
[55:33.660 --> 55:34.780]  and in the position I am in
[55:34.780 --> 55:36.820]  if I did not fuck up a whole bunch.
[55:36.820 --> 55:38.020]  That's how I learned the most.
[55:38.020 --> 55:39.420]  I think that's how humans learn the most
[55:39.420 --> 55:40.620]  is by making huge mistakes.
[55:40.620 --> 55:41.500]  The more mistakes we make,
[55:41.500 --> 55:42.700]  the more we're able to learn.
[55:42.700 --> 55:44.140]  So accept your mistakes,
[55:44.140 --> 55:44.980]  you guys,
[55:44.980 --> 55:45.820]  when you see some bugs in there,
[55:45.820 --> 55:46.660]  it's not your fault.
[55:46.660 --> 55:47.500]  You didn't do that.
[55:47.500 --> 55:48.420]  You didn't cause that.
[55:48.420 --> 55:49.260]  Learn from it.
[55:49.260 --> 55:50.100]  That's what we're trying to say here.
[55:50.100 --> 55:50.940]  Learn from it,
[55:50.940 --> 55:52.020]  admit it.
[55:52.020 --> 55:53.780]  You're going to have to admit you got something.
[55:53.780 --> 55:54.620]  Yeah.
[55:54.620 --> 55:55.460]  Share it with your friends.
[55:55.460 --> 55:56.280]  You guys might all learn something.
[55:56.280 --> 55:57.120]  You might be able to come on a podcast
[55:57.120 --> 55:58.900]  and talk about it one day.
[55:58.900 --> 55:59.740]  All right, bro.
[56:00.740 --> 56:01.580]  I appreciate it.
[56:01.580 --> 56:02.940]  Thank you for coming.
[56:02.940 --> 56:03.780]  You got anything else you want to say
[56:03.780 --> 56:04.940]  while I got you here?
[56:04.940 --> 56:06.220]  No, I just really,
[56:06.220 --> 56:09.260]  yeah, check out Sandsaw CBD.
[56:09.260 --> 56:10.820]  Sandsawcbd.com.

[56:19.220 --> 56:20.260]  Support what we're doing.
[56:20.260 --> 56:23.540]  We're really trying to lead by example
[56:23.540 --> 56:26.180]  here in Colorado with this whole CBD movement.
[56:26.180 --> 56:27.580]  You're definitely making me feel
[56:27.580 --> 56:28.820]  like I'm not working hard enough.
[56:28.820 --> 56:29.860]  Yeah, maybe come back
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.300]  and we can just talk about this whole CBD gig
[56:32.300 --> 56:34.020]  and express a little bit more
[56:34.020 --> 56:35.500]  on what we got going on out there.
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.500]  I'd love to hear more about that.
[56:36.500 --> 56:37.540]  I'm sure the listeners would love it.
[56:37.540 --> 56:39.580]  We had our friend Fox on who's a CBD guy
[56:39.580 --> 56:41.340]  and he got a lot of listens.
[56:41.340 --> 56:42.180]  Cool, man.
[56:42.180 --> 56:43.300]  Well, I really appreciate you having me again, man.
[56:43.300 --> 56:44.700]  Oh, thanks for coming and taking some time.
[56:44.700 --> 56:46.340]  And dude, thanks for smoking that skunk joint with me.
[56:46.340 --> 56:47.180]  I'm a little slow.
[56:47.180 --> 56:48.420]  I appreciate that.
[56:48.420 --> 56:49.500]  No problem, man.
[56:49.500 --> 56:50.580]  All right, we're gonna wrap this part up.
[56:50.580 --> 56:51.740]  You guys, I'll be back in just a minute
[56:51.740 --> 56:52.860]  to put a tail on this show.
[56:52.860 --> 56:54.500]  Thanks for listening.
[56:54.500 --> 56:55.740]  Yeah, I hope you guys learned
[56:55.740 --> 56:57.460]  as much from that episode as I did.
[56:57.460 --> 56:58.820]  I want to thank Sean for joining me.
[56:58.820 --> 57:00.660]  Make sure you follow Sean on Instagram.
[57:00.660 --> 57:03.220]  It's at King underscore Cola underscore.
[57:03.220 --> 57:05.300]  King with a K, Cola with a C.
[57:05.300 --> 57:06.500]  Make sure you follow him.
[57:06.500 --> 57:07.340]  Give him some support.
[57:07.340 --> 57:08.780]  I'm sure you'll learn something else from him
[57:08.780 --> 57:10.820]  if you follow him on Instagram.
[57:10.820 --> 57:12.700]  You guys, I want to send a huge shout out to the sponsors.
[57:12.700 --> 57:15.740]  Make sure you check out Hitman Glass at hitmanglass.com.
[57:15.740 --> 57:18.900]  I'm sitting here dabbing some Turpex G Funk OG Fresh Nectar
[57:18.900 --> 57:20.380]  out of my Hitman short stack.
[57:20.380 --> 57:21.620]  There's nothing like it.
[57:21.620 --> 57:23.620]  You guys, I want to give a huge shout out to Hitman,
[57:23.620 --> 57:26.940]  Highly Educated Titanium, Oil Slick, and Emotech,
[57:26.940 --> 57:29.260]  and a huge shout out to Turpex.
[57:29.260 --> 57:31.740]  And I think that's all for the podcast this week.
[57:31.740 --> 57:34.540]  I would appreciate it if you go to the iTunes store,
[57:34.540 --> 57:36.060]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[57:36.060 --> 57:38.420]  find the review section, give me a five-star rating,
[57:38.420 --> 57:39.460]  and type in a little comment
[57:39.460 --> 57:40.620]  and let me know what you think of the show,
[57:40.620 --> 57:42.300]  and I will read your comments
[57:42.300 --> 57:44.740]  on an episode that is coming up very soon,
[57:44.740 --> 57:46.540]  very likely the next episode.
[57:46.540 --> 57:48.340]  If you've got something to say, I would love to hear it.
[57:48.340 --> 57:49.900]  You can find me on social media.
[57:49.900 --> 57:52.620]  On Facebook, it's at Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[57:52.620 --> 57:54.620]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast,
[57:54.620 --> 57:56.980]  or you can email me at simplygrowfromyourheart
[57:56.980 --> 57:59.140]  at hotmail.com.
[57:59.140 --> 58:00.580]  You guys, don't forget that the show is available
[58:00.580 --> 58:03.260]  on iTunes, Stitcher, and most of the episodes
[58:03.260 --> 58:05.780]  are archived on iregeneticscolorado.com.
[58:05.780 --> 58:08.540]  I think it goes to about 27 or something like that.
[58:08.540 --> 58:10.600]  For some reason, part of the episodes got dropped.
[58:10.600 --> 58:11.860]  I will fix that.
[58:11.860 --> 58:14.340]  Also, there used to be a donation button
[58:14.340 --> 58:16.060]  on the podcast page.
[58:16.060 --> 58:17.760]  They took that down, you guys.
[58:17.760 --> 58:19.660]  Unfortunately, PayPal did not approve
[58:19.660 --> 58:22.820]  of my podcast being related to cannabis.
[58:22.820 --> 58:26.000]  They did not want to let me take donations for that.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.220]  They have suspended my PayPal account.
[58:28.220 --> 58:29.120]  My account is frozen.
[58:29.120 --> 58:30.280]  I can't access my funds.
[58:30.280 --> 58:31.780]  I cannot take in any more funds.
[58:31.780 --> 58:35.320]  I will contact them, and I will see if I can fix that.
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.620]  Somebody said they tried to donate to the show.
[58:37.620 --> 58:39.540]  That is why you cannot donate.
[58:39.540 --> 58:40.900]  I am not the webmaster.
[58:40.900 --> 58:42.140]  My friend Tony is the webmaster.
[58:42.140 --> 58:44.020]  He is also a college student.
[58:44.020 --> 58:44.880]  He's been a little tied up.
[58:44.880 --> 58:46.880]  When he gets a minute, he will fix that for me,
[58:46.880 --> 58:48.820]  unless I can convince PayPal
[58:48.820 --> 58:50.980]  to let me accept some donations.
[58:50.980 --> 58:52.340]  All right, you guys, I want to thank you guys
[58:52.860 --> 58:53.700]  for listening.
[58:53.700 --> 58:54.520]  Make sure you check back with me in a few days.
[58:54.520 --> 58:56.140]  I've got another episode coming up.
[58:56.140 --> 58:57.380]  Make sure you follow me on Instagram.
[58:57.380 --> 58:58.580]  I've got a new Instagram page.
[58:58.580 --> 59:00.220]  It's irie underscore genetics.
[59:00.220 --> 59:01.940]  I would love it if you'd follow me there.
[59:01.940 --> 59:03.740]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[59:03.740 --> 59:05.320]  Thanks again for listening, and until next time,
[59:05.320 --> 59:07.920]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
