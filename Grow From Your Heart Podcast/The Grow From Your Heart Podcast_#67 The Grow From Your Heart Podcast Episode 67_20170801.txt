[00:23.730 --> 00:27.770]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:27.770 --> 00:31.790]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:31.790 --> 00:35.470]  or a hardcore dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.470 --> 00:39.310]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. Thanks

[00:50.930 --> 00:54.070]  with my good buddy, Clint. How you doing, Clint? I'm doing good, Jeff. What's up, brother?
[00:54.070 --> 00:56.750]  I'm hanging out, man. I'm going to turn down that music. That's kind of loud in the headphones
[00:56.750 --> 01:00.270]  there. Yeah, we're good, man. We're good. I love the reggae real loud in the ear. If
[01:00.270 --> 01:04.350]  it's too loud, you're too old, y'all. Yeah. Or you can turn down the volume on your phone.
[01:04.350 --> 01:08.670]  I don't know. Yeah, yeah. There you go. Let's read some ads real quick so we can get that

[02:37.810 --> 02:41.170]  to go to a couple of comedy shows over the past week.
[02:41.170 --> 02:43.890]  You said this is coming out in a couple weeks?

[02:48.410 --> 02:49.410]  of May.
[02:49.410 --> 02:54.250]  I feel it. Hey, everybody. Just so you know, Mother's Day, May 10th.
[02:54.250 --> 02:55.250]  There you go.
[02:55.250 --> 02:57.450]  Don't fucking forget. It's your mom. You love her.
[02:57.890 --> 03:01.930]  Take a fat dab. Give your mom a hug for me. And on Mother's Day, buy the bitch some flowers.
[03:01.930 --> 03:07.370]  That's right. I'm just thinking ahead. I'm helping out every single one of us stoner
[03:07.370 --> 03:12.570]  boys that's like, oh shit, I would have forgot. I'm trying to at least. Maybe you guys already
[03:12.570 --> 03:13.570]  have.
[03:13.570 --> 03:15.930]  Good heads up, dude. This will be out before Mother's Day. You guys don't forget. Don't
[03:15.930 --> 03:18.410]  fuck it up. Love your mom. That's where you came from.
[03:18.410 --> 03:22.810]  That's my sponsor is your mom. That's who I'm trying to get to promote.
[03:22.810 --> 03:23.810]  Not my mom. Your mom.
[03:23.810 --> 03:26.570]  Nope. Everybody's mom. Just like, hey, Mother Earth.
[03:26.690 --> 03:31.490]  There you go. All right. That's already an awkward start.
[03:31.490 --> 03:35.530]  May 10th is Mother's Day and we get to brag. Do you know what we're doing May 10th, bro?
[03:35.530 --> 03:37.090]  I do know what we're doing May 10th.
[03:37.090 --> 03:43.570]  Clint and I will be seeing Doug Benson hosting his podcast, Doug Loves Movies at Comedy Works.
[03:43.570 --> 03:45.410]  My favorite comedy club on the damn planet.
[03:45.410 --> 03:47.290]  The only comedy club that's worth a shit.
[03:47.290 --> 03:50.010]  Well, unless you're going to a different one.
[03:50.010 --> 03:53.250]  Yeah. The next one we go to will be worth a shit and then we'll talk.
[03:53.250 --> 03:55.970]  I love the Denver improv, so I have to back that place up.
[03:55.970 --> 03:57.130]  That was nice and sweet.
[03:57.130 --> 04:00.330]  But Comedy Works is my favorite comedy club on the planet that I've ever been to.
[04:00.330 --> 04:01.330]  It's awesome. It's amazing.
[04:01.330 --> 04:02.330]  We get to see Doug Benson there.
[04:02.330 --> 04:04.330]  May 10th recording his podcast.
[04:04.330 --> 04:05.410]  Doug Loves Movies.
[04:05.410 --> 04:06.410]  Doug Loves Movies.
[04:06.410 --> 04:07.410]  Yes.
[04:07.410 --> 04:09.970]  If you guys are into Doug Benson, check that out.
[04:09.970 --> 04:11.370]  I do need to give you a quick apology.
[04:11.370 --> 04:12.690]  Sorry about the growers meeting.
[04:12.690 --> 04:15.650]  I had very short notice that that was not going to happen.
[04:15.650 --> 04:16.810]  The growers meeting didn't happen.
[04:16.810 --> 04:19.970]  If you guys showed up, I'm in my house right now.
[04:19.970 --> 04:20.970]  It's the time of the meeting.
[04:20.970 --> 04:22.730]  We're here recording, taking dabs.
[04:22.730 --> 04:23.730]  It's about 710.
[04:23.730 --> 04:24.730]  Yeah.
[04:24.730 --> 04:25.730]  Yeah.
[04:25.730 --> 04:28.450]  This is when the meeting should be happening, but I got a free time, some free time.
[04:28.450 --> 04:29.730]  So we came here and recorded a podcast.
[04:29.730 --> 04:30.730]  I apologize.
[04:30.730 --> 04:31.890]  I don't work for high grow.
[04:31.890 --> 04:33.130]  I was just simply trying to help them out.
[04:33.130 --> 04:34.250]  I was advertising.
[04:34.250 --> 04:35.250]  I don't know what happened.
[04:35.250 --> 04:36.250]  I don't know why they couldn't do it.
[04:36.250 --> 04:37.250]  I hope everything is cool with those guys.
[04:37.250 --> 04:38.250]  I love them.
[04:38.250 --> 04:39.250]  Big shout out to burn everybody at high grow.
[04:39.250 --> 04:40.250]  Burn and Jesse.
[04:40.250 --> 04:41.250]  I apologize.
[04:41.250 --> 04:42.530]  We'll get another meeting together.
[04:42.530 --> 04:43.530]  It will happen.
[04:43.530 --> 04:46.430]  I won't do this to you guys again.
[04:46.430 --> 04:47.930]  So let's get on with what we were saying.
[04:47.930 --> 04:48.930]  Doug Benson.
[04:48.930 --> 04:49.930]  We get to see him May 10th.
[04:49.930 --> 04:52.410]  I'm going to start it off by saying this.
[04:53.090 --> 04:56.090]  I really hope he does a better show than he did when we saw him Monday night.
[04:56.090 --> 04:58.890]  Yeah, dude, that was, uh, we, we went up.
[04:58.890 --> 05:03.690]  Uh, I took a buddy of mine, Jeff, uh, came up as well.
[05:03.690 --> 05:08.010]  And then, uh, so shout out to my buddy drew, uh, cause he'll be listening.
[05:08.010 --> 05:09.010]  Dude.
[05:09.010 --> 05:10.010]  Shout out to my friend, Danielle.
[05:10.010 --> 05:11.010]  That's right.
[05:11.010 --> 05:15.650]  I ended up realizing I had a plus one available for the comedy show and I called her about
[05:15.650 --> 05:17.470]  two and a half hours before the show.
[05:17.470 --> 05:22.130]  And I said, if you can get your cute little ass to Denver and the next from Pueblo, uh,
[05:22.850 --> 05:25.370]  to the restaurant where we're all going to eat, I will order you food and have a plate
[05:25.370 --> 05:26.370]  of food waiting for you.
[05:26.370 --> 05:29.490]  By the time you get there, you can grub down and we got to get to the show.
[05:29.490 --> 05:31.650]  And I told her, please be here by this time.
[05:31.650 --> 05:33.690]  And she made it five minutes early, dude.
[05:33.690 --> 05:34.690]  Yeah.
[05:34.690 --> 05:39.010]  A shout out to a girl that got ready, got herself beautiful and drove to Denver in two
[05:39.010 --> 05:40.010]  and a half hours.
[05:40.010 --> 05:41.130]  Ladies, it's possible.
[05:41.130 --> 05:42.130]  You can do it.
[05:42.130 --> 05:43.130]  I'm proud of you.
[05:43.130 --> 05:44.130]  So big shout out to Danielle.
[05:44.130 --> 05:45.130]  Thanks for doing that.
[05:45.130 --> 05:46.130]  I appreciate it.
[05:46.130 --> 05:47.130]  I'm glad you got to come to the show with us.
[05:47.130 --> 05:49.330]  So, uh, and also shout out to your friend that you brought with us, man.
[05:49.330 --> 05:50.330]  Drew.
[05:50.330 --> 05:51.330]  Yeah.
[05:51.330 --> 05:52.610]  The first time I got to meet him and he seems like a fun guy.
[05:52.610 --> 05:55.730]  We have common friends, so we're definitely going to hang out and take some dabs.
[05:55.730 --> 05:56.730]  Yeah.
[05:56.730 --> 05:57.730]  You guys were talking about him.
[05:57.730 --> 05:58.730]  That was cool.
[05:58.730 --> 05:59.730]  Some, some cannabis people.
[05:59.730 --> 06:00.730]  But that's Pueblo too.
[06:00.730 --> 06:05.770]  But it's the same thing as like, uh, I just were one degree of separation from everybody.
[06:05.770 --> 06:07.690]  One degree of Kevin Bacon from every single person.
[06:07.690 --> 06:08.690]  That's the truth.
[06:08.690 --> 06:09.690]  That's the truth.
[06:09.690 --> 06:10.690]  So shout out to Drew's.
[06:10.690 --> 06:11.690]  Good meeting you, bro.
[06:11.690 --> 06:12.690]  Glad to meet you.
[06:12.690 --> 06:13.690]  We're definitely going to hang out and take some dabs together.
[06:13.690 --> 06:15.130]  Uh, I saw the picture of Drew's car ride home.
[06:15.130 --> 06:17.290]  It looks like you took a little nappy poo, bro.
[06:17.290 --> 06:19.930]  Well, fortunately it was after the show we got to the car.
[06:20.530 --> 06:24.690]  But Drew, you did pass the fuck out and it was hilarious to watch.
[06:24.690 --> 06:28.610]  Like, well, he kept, he kept like trying to like lay over onto me as I'm driving.
[06:28.610 --> 06:33.290]  I kept having to like shove him back, like get over either that or finish the job you
[06:33.290 --> 06:34.290]  started.
[06:34.290 --> 06:35.290]  There you go.
[06:35.290 --> 06:38.330]  My Dick, your, your front, your car has got those big couch seats.
[06:38.330 --> 06:41.050]  So I'm sure he was just thinking he's cuddled up on the couch with you.
[06:41.050 --> 06:44.370]  That's that is the most comfortable seats you've ever ridden.
[06:44.370 --> 06:45.610]  I don't know about that.
[06:45.610 --> 06:46.610]  It's pretty comfortable.
[06:46.610 --> 06:47.610]  His car is a boat.
[06:47.610 --> 06:48.610]  You guys, it's good.
[06:48.610 --> 06:49.890]  You could go on a cruise in Clint's car.
[06:50.850 --> 06:51.850]  Everybody coming out for the cruise.
[06:51.850 --> 06:54.330]  We'll be going May 10th, Mother's Day.
[06:54.330 --> 06:55.330]  I don't know.
[06:55.330 --> 06:56.930]  Um, no, there's no cruise anyway.
[06:56.930 --> 07:01.090]  So we got to see Doug and we were, um, front row.
[07:01.090 --> 07:02.090]  We were front row.
[07:02.090 --> 07:05.330]  I want to give a shout out to the mellow mushroom and Kelso Marley.
[07:05.330 --> 07:06.450]  Um, right.
[07:06.450 --> 07:09.370]  We've made friends with this lovely waitress at the mellow mushroom.
[07:09.370 --> 07:10.450]  She is a fellow grower.
[07:10.450 --> 07:11.610]  She is an extract artist.
[07:11.610 --> 07:13.770]  She has a fucking cool dog named Zephyr.
[07:13.770 --> 07:14.770]  Yeah.
[07:14.770 --> 07:15.770]  Uh, so shout out to Kelso.
[07:15.770 --> 07:17.010]  Shout out to shout out to Zephyr.
[07:17.010 --> 07:18.450]  Uh, hope you guys are doing great.
[07:18.490 --> 07:20.370]  I hope you listen to our listening to this episode.
[07:20.370 --> 07:23.850]  They told me, she told me that they listened to the podcast, so I hope they're checking
[07:23.850 --> 07:24.850]  it out.
[07:24.850 --> 07:27.850]  Uh, she's, she's not only an awesome waitress, but she's a cool lady.
[07:27.850 --> 07:29.730]  I've been talking to her on Instagram and whatnot.
[07:29.730 --> 07:30.730]  She seems like a great chick.
[07:30.730 --> 07:32.410]  So yeah, check out that mellow mushroom too.
[07:32.410 --> 07:33.410]  That place is delicious.
[07:33.410 --> 07:34.410]  Yeah.
[07:34.410 --> 07:38.170]  Clint's a carnivore carnivorous meat eating freak over there.
[07:38.170 --> 07:42.570]  Um, and I am a scrawny pussy, hippie vegetarian.
[07:42.570 --> 07:43.570]  You can agree with that, bro.
[07:43.570 --> 07:45.890]  I'm not saying nothing brother.
[07:45.890 --> 07:48.930]  And uh, they have a meal on that menu for everybody.
[07:48.930 --> 07:49.930]  Yep.
[07:49.930 --> 07:51.370]  I'm completely satisfied.
[07:51.370 --> 07:52.370]  Clint is satisfied.
[07:52.370 --> 07:54.930]  We sit across the table from each other and belittle each other's food.
[07:54.930 --> 07:56.810]  We really do it too.
[07:56.810 --> 08:03.810]  Look at all the grease coming off your, your meat pizza carnivore piece of shit.
[08:03.810 --> 08:06.810]  This is all the shit that you should feed my food.
[08:06.810 --> 08:07.810]  Yeah.
[08:07.810 --> 08:09.930]  So huge shout out to the mushroom.
[08:09.930 --> 08:10.930]  Those guys are great.
[08:10.930 --> 08:12.450]  So now we can go on to the Doug Benson part.
[08:12.770 --> 08:16.370]  We owe a shout out to Baker and comedy works also.
[08:16.370 --> 08:17.370]  Yeah.
[08:17.370 --> 08:21.130]  Um, I happen to have some VIP preferred seating status at comedy works.
[08:21.130 --> 08:24.810]  As long as I let them know I'm coming in advance, they will get me some VIP seats.
[08:24.810 --> 08:26.930]  So we saw Doug Benson.
[08:26.930 --> 08:29.370]  We were front fucking row for Doug Benson.
[08:29.370 --> 08:30.370]  Again, it was great.
[08:30.370 --> 08:33.790]  I got to see him record his comedy special.
[08:33.790 --> 08:37.770]  It was the third time they had done that show that night.
[08:37.770 --> 08:39.730]  So we'll get on with that in a second.
[08:39.730 --> 08:41.610]  Um, the show opened with Graham Elwood.
[08:41.770 --> 08:42.770]  How'd you feel about Graham Elwood?
[08:42.770 --> 08:46.170]  Graham Elwood was one of the funniest guys I've seen in a long time.
[08:46.170 --> 08:48.610]  Now I was really fucking high.
[08:48.610 --> 08:49.610]  Of course.
[08:49.610 --> 08:54.330]  I don't remember a lot of what he said and I would zone out like he'd go on some rants
[08:54.330 --> 08:57.330]  and I'd just start zoning out fucking high as fuck.
[08:57.330 --> 09:02.170]  Just like, man, it would be cool to see like what the inside of a rainbow looks like.
[09:02.170 --> 09:03.970]  You know what I mean?
[09:03.970 --> 09:09.330]  Like I was just, he was, he was still talking about something like, like his kid or something
[09:09.330 --> 09:10.330]  like that.
[09:10.330 --> 09:11.330]  Something happy.
[09:12.050 --> 09:15.490]  I guess I looked over a couple of times and I can tell you were zoned out.
[09:15.490 --> 09:16.490]  Oh yeah.
[09:16.490 --> 09:17.490]  So Graham Elwood's hilarious.
[09:17.490 --> 09:21.170]  You guys, um, he's got a fake band known as the whistling Baines.
[09:21.170 --> 09:22.730]  Uh, he's on a lot of podcasts.
[09:22.730 --> 09:26.170]  If you listen to that Doug Benson podcast, you will hear some Graham Elwood.
[09:26.170 --> 09:29.930]  He's also got his own podcast called the comedy film nerds.
[09:29.930 --> 09:37.510]  Um, Graham actually invited me to the LA pod fest in Los Angeles and he told me that there
[09:37.590 --> 09:42.070]  is a big room where you can set up and everybody records their podcast out there.
[09:42.070 --> 09:46.590]  And he said that if I come, he would be on my show and he shook my hand.
[09:46.590 --> 09:51.350]  So if I make it to LA pod fast pod fest, you guys will hear Graham Elwood on the podcast.
[09:51.350 --> 09:52.350]  That would be fucking cool.
[09:52.350 --> 09:54.110]  He was, he was a really nice guy.
[09:54.110 --> 09:56.630]  Um, I know that I can't keep it in check tonight.
[09:56.630 --> 09:59.830]  I've said the F bomb probably 15 times already.
[09:59.830 --> 10:00.830]  Yeah.
[10:00.830 --> 10:05.030]  Um, anyway, he said it so quietly.
[10:06.030 --> 10:11.710]  Um, but he, but Graham amazed me because he was funny and he was clean, which is hard
[10:11.710 --> 10:12.710]  to do.
[10:12.710 --> 10:14.890]  So like, uh, just more props to him.
[10:14.890 --> 10:15.890]  He was really funny.
[10:15.890 --> 10:19.870]  If, if he would ever listen to this, I hope he would hear us say that, uh, he was the
[10:19.870 --> 10:26.510]  best part of that night because Doug Benson came on after him and Doug, first thing he
[10:26.510 --> 10:29.030]  said, he goes, uh, I woke up this morning.
[10:29.030 --> 10:30.030]  I started smoking.
[10:30.030 --> 10:31.030]  This was on four 20.
[10:31.030 --> 10:32.230]  Yeah, this was on four 20.
[10:32.230 --> 10:33.910]  So let's, yeah, let's remind the people that.
[10:33.910 --> 10:34.910]  Yeah.
[10:35.790 --> 10:36.790]  So he woke up, he started smoking.
[10:36.790 --> 10:41.950]  He did a four 20 show up till he was, he was smoking up until then.
[10:41.950 --> 10:44.010]  He just kept smoking all day.
[10:44.010 --> 10:48.490]  And that was the first thing he said is like, he did all he could do to make it to where
[10:48.490 --> 10:50.670]  he couldn't make it to that last show.
[10:50.670 --> 10:51.670]  Yeah.
[10:51.670 --> 10:53.670]  His goal was to be too high to record that show.
[10:53.670 --> 10:55.190]  I think he succeeded.
[10:55.190 --> 10:59.430]  You know, I've seen, I've gotten Doug Benson high several times and I've never seen him
[10:59.430 --> 11:00.430]  that high.
[11:00.430 --> 11:04.790]  I got high and this sounds like bragging, but I'm kind of, I'm not bros with Doug, but
[11:05.670 --> 11:06.670]  I'm internet buddies with Doug.
[11:06.670 --> 11:07.670]  I'm Twitter friends with Doug.
[11:07.670 --> 11:08.670]  We talk and shit.
[11:08.670 --> 11:11.390]  And some of the comedians know who I am by now because I've gone to enough shows.
[11:11.390 --> 11:14.350]  So he relies on Rasta Jeff to get him high before the show.
[11:14.350 --> 11:16.830]  He knows I've got some dank weed and I'm not psycho.
[11:16.830 --> 11:17.830]  So he hits me up.
[11:17.830 --> 11:18.830]  He hit me up to get him high.
[11:18.830 --> 11:22.230]  One time I got him high and he told me from the stage, he fucked up a joke and looked
[11:22.230 --> 11:24.630]  at me and said, you got me too high, bro.
[11:24.630 --> 11:25.630]  Yeah.
[11:25.630 --> 11:29.030]  That night he was three or four times beyond that level of highness.
[11:29.030 --> 11:32.490]  He was, he was so fucking skinny eyed fucking.
[11:32.490 --> 11:34.030]  You could not see.
[11:34.030 --> 11:35.030]  One eye was skinny.
[11:35.030 --> 11:36.030]  One eye was weird.
[11:36.030 --> 11:41.390]  I think one eye was working kind of, but it was, it was fucking, I don't know, dude.
[11:41.390 --> 11:48.390]  He was so baked that he just, he, it just wasn't even that much fun.
[11:48.390 --> 11:49.910]  He kept putting his head on the microphone.
[11:49.910 --> 11:53.390]  You guys heard this sound a lot and that was his head hitting the microphone so that he
[11:53.390 --> 11:54.390]  could take a little break.
[11:54.390 --> 11:58.030]  He was, I mean, and he was laughing at his own jokes and there was some really hilarious
[11:58.030 --> 11:59.030]  shit that he said.
[11:59.030 --> 12:01.070]  He spent 30 minutes reading fucking tweets.
[12:01.070 --> 12:02.070]  Thank you.
[12:02.070 --> 12:03.070]  Yeah.
[12:03.070 --> 12:04.710]  For every 30 minutes of his show, he read tweets, which he usually spends.
[12:04.710 --> 12:08.430]  But the problem was that 30 minutes was only divided up by like five tweets.
[12:08.430 --> 12:09.430]  Yes.
[12:09.430 --> 12:10.510]  It wasn't like a whole bunch of tweets.
[12:10.510 --> 12:15.190]  It was like five people that were audacious enough to pull their phone out in a comedy
[12:15.190 --> 12:19.110]  show and send him a shout out or an, and tweet at him.
[12:19.110 --> 12:20.110]  Right then.
[12:20.110 --> 12:21.110]  Yeah.
[12:21.110 --> 12:22.110]  That's we're up front row.
[12:22.110 --> 12:23.110]  I can't do that.
[12:23.110 --> 12:25.830]  No, that looks, he would, uh, Graham was staring at me cause my phone was on my lap because
[12:25.830 --> 12:26.950]  it's too big for my pocket.
[12:26.950 --> 12:30.710]  I got this iPhone six plus, my phone was on my lap and Graham kept looking at it.
[12:30.870 --> 12:32.790]  I felt like grandma would look at my phone twice.
[12:32.790 --> 12:34.830]  Like he's got his fucking phone out.
[12:34.830 --> 12:37.670]  But maybe if it was on your lap, he was looking at something else.
[12:37.670 --> 12:39.110]  Was he looking at my package, bro?
[12:39.110 --> 12:40.510]  You think Graham was checking it out?
[12:40.510 --> 12:42.670]  He was trying to see if he got any seeds down there.
[12:42.670 --> 12:44.070]  Ooh, I got plenty of seeds buddy.
[12:44.070 --> 12:45.550]  This is team I read genetics.
[12:45.550 --> 12:46.550]  All right.
[12:46.550 --> 12:50.950]  So I saw Doug Benson literally yawn.
[12:50.950 --> 12:53.510]  He had to move the mic from his face and yawn.
[12:53.510 --> 12:54.510]  That was bad.
[12:54.510 --> 12:56.670]  Onstage performing his comedy special.
[12:56.670 --> 13:01.150]  So he actually said, uh, this is my third time recording this and what I want to do
[13:01.150 --> 13:05.350]  is make sure to get the jokes that I didn't get perfect the last couple of times.
[13:05.350 --> 13:09.990]  Now, now don't, don't let me say anything other than I respect him for being honest,
[13:09.990 --> 13:14.750]  but I just didn't pay to go see a guy just kind of muddle through something.
[13:14.750 --> 13:15.750]  Right.
[13:15.750 --> 13:16.750]  Do you know what I mean?
[13:16.750 --> 13:17.750]  Yeah.
[13:17.750 --> 13:19.870]  When I go to see a concert, I don't want to watch Metallica do soundcheck five times.
[13:19.870 --> 13:20.870]  I don't know why I picked Metallica.
[13:20.870 --> 13:21.870]  I don't know.
[13:21.870 --> 13:26.550]  No, that would be, well, I mean maybe I want to watch them nail
[13:27.430 --> 13:28.430]  in her sand man.
[13:28.430 --> 13:31.230]  I don't want to watch them try to do some song they haven't done right in a couple of
[13:31.230 --> 13:32.230]  weeks.
[13:32.230 --> 13:34.110]  We haven't played this song properly.
[13:34.110 --> 13:35.550]  We're going to try it in front of you.
[13:35.550 --> 13:36.550]  Yeah.
[13:36.550 --> 13:37.550]  Three times.
[13:37.550 --> 13:38.550]  Yeah.
[13:38.550 --> 13:40.550]  Or I mean, Doug only did things, I guess he did things three times that day though.
[13:40.550 --> 13:41.550]  Yeah.
[13:41.550 --> 13:45.470]  And he did a couple of the bits twice because he forgot he did one when he was doing a bit
[13:45.470 --> 13:46.470]  for us.
[13:46.470 --> 13:47.470]  Yeah.
[13:47.470 --> 13:49.030]  Well, it's because he broke it off early in the first part.
[13:49.030 --> 13:51.750]  He didn't tell like the same part of the story.
[13:51.750 --> 13:54.550]  I don't remember how high were we?
[13:54.550 --> 13:59.870]  Part of that was because he had a pocket full of notes that were disheveled.
[13:59.870 --> 14:04.750]  It looked like, um, it looks like your grandpa had gone to Lowe's, you know, when grandpa
[14:04.750 --> 14:08.230]  comes home from going out all day, he's got a pocket full of receipts and a couple of
[14:08.230 --> 14:13.030]  breath mints and a fucking toothpick and like a shopping list.
[14:13.030 --> 14:15.270]  And now grandpa's got a joint in there.
[14:15.270 --> 14:16.270]  Yeah.
[14:16.270 --> 14:17.270]  Yeah.
[14:17.270 --> 14:20.430]  Well he had, there's like four or five different colors of pieces of paper in there.
[14:20.430 --> 14:24.510]  There was a receipt for Barnes and Noble in there that I could see like, I don't know
[14:25.470 --> 14:28.670]  if he had scribbled on all of it, but that's what, that's where his notes were, was in
[14:28.670 --> 14:30.630]  that handful of grandpa.
[14:30.630 --> 14:37.670]  And he kept staring at handful of grandpa is also the name of my new metal band.
[14:37.670 --> 14:38.710]  Can we write that down?
[14:38.710 --> 14:44.710]  Because I have, I have a use for the name handful of grandpa.
[14:44.710 --> 14:48.630]  Another project needs a name and if you're not going to use it, Oh no, buddy, we're,
[14:48.630 --> 14:49.630]  we're going to make something out of this.
[14:49.630 --> 14:51.030]  Guys, make sure you listen to my other podcast.
[14:51.030 --> 14:52.030]  It's called handful of grandpa.
[14:52.030 --> 14:57.350]  It hasn't been put out yet, but it's going to be, yes, that may just be an episode, but
[14:57.350 --> 14:59.710]  still this, that needs to be written down.
[14:59.710 --> 15:02.390]  And I'm sorry if I'm wasting time writing down this phrase handful.
[15:02.390 --> 15:07.030]  If you guys have made it this far into this podcast, we salute you.
[15:07.030 --> 15:11.630]  Second of all, um, you know, we're probably not going to be talking too much about growing
[15:11.630 --> 15:15.270]  not on this one, but the next episode we're growing as people though.
[15:15.270 --> 15:16.830]  All right.
[15:16.830 --> 15:23.790]  Now I know I remember why I forget to bring comedians in the show.
[15:23.790 --> 15:24.790]  This is the shit that happens.
[15:24.790 --> 15:25.790]  No, I love it.
[15:25.790 --> 15:26.790]  I love the chaos.
[15:26.790 --> 15:27.790]  I hope the listeners like it.
[15:27.790 --> 15:29.590]  Uh, it doesn't always have to be intense grow lessons.
[15:29.590 --> 15:31.030]  Danielle, you could put your notebook away.
[15:31.030 --> 15:35.670]  There will be nothing to write down this time other than the phrase handful of grandpa.
[15:35.670 --> 15:38.390]  We win anyway.
[15:38.390 --> 15:42.070]  So, but, um, so we had those disheveled notes, right?
[15:42.070 --> 15:43.630]  And then that's where we were there.
[15:43.630 --> 15:44.630]  Yeah.
[15:45.430 --> 15:47.870]  And I think he needs glasses to go with the notes.
[15:47.870 --> 15:51.670]  He definitely needed to open his eyes a little bit because they were fucking closed.
[15:51.670 --> 15:52.670]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:52.670 --> 15:53.670]  They were closed.
[15:53.670 --> 15:54.670]  He was fucked up.
[15:54.670 --> 15:57.670]  Somebody threw a joint on stage and it took him two minutes to find it and pick it up.
[15:57.670 --> 15:59.390]  He almost stepped on it before he found it.
[15:59.390 --> 16:00.390]  He was waiting.
[16:00.390 --> 16:04.510]  And if you've ever seen the comedy works like stage, it's well lit and it's maybe the size
[16:04.510 --> 16:05.510]  of your kitchen table.
[16:05.510 --> 16:06.510]  Yes.
[16:06.510 --> 16:08.470]  Like it's, it's not a big thing.
[16:08.470 --> 16:09.470]  No, it's like eight by eight.
[16:09.470 --> 16:11.470]  And there was nothing on the stage.
[16:11.470 --> 16:12.630]  It's like a blue carpet.
[16:12.630 --> 16:14.590]  What did somebody say the floor looked like?
[16:15.550 --> 16:18.550]  Somebody tweeted and said the floor looked like a nail or a salon floor.
[16:18.550 --> 16:19.550]  A day spa floor.
[16:19.550 --> 16:23.230]  I thought that was weird, but it was, it was vacuumed beautifully.
[16:23.230 --> 16:24.230]  It was perfect anyway.
[16:24.230 --> 16:29.150]  No, but it was just like 30 minutes on five tweets, which was kind of boring.
[16:29.150 --> 16:30.150]  Got into some other stuff.
[16:30.150 --> 16:34.550]  And then he tried to do like other tweets or something like later in the show, didn't
[16:34.550 --> 16:35.870]  he?
[16:35.870 --> 16:37.070]  Wasn't he doing tweet relief?
[16:37.070 --> 16:38.070]  Oh yeah.
[16:38.070 --> 16:40.430]  Uh, he did a thing it's called watch this.
[16:40.430 --> 16:44.110]  Not that is a game that he plays on a show where he lets the audience members select
[16:44.110 --> 16:48.590]  movies and then he decides which one to watch, but he was too high to keep track of what
[16:48.590 --> 16:50.230]  the other audience members were saying.
[16:50.230 --> 16:52.350]  I think, Jesus, I don't remember Matt.
[16:52.350 --> 16:55.590]  Well, it was the things called promotional tool.
[16:55.590 --> 17:00.710]  And uh, I mean, we, we definitely felt like we got used like a tool.
[17:00.710 --> 17:02.390]  Like it just, it did.
[17:02.390 --> 17:06.630]  It felt a little like a, like, ah, you know what guys, it sucks to be you, but this is
[17:06.630 --> 17:07.630]  what's happening.
[17:07.630 --> 17:08.910]  And maybe that's the way it has to be.
[17:08.910 --> 17:13.070]  I didn't want to say that when we all got to the car, when we all were talking about
[17:13.070 --> 17:15.230]  it later, I was like, so what'd you guys think?
[17:15.230 --> 17:19.190]  And I was just waiting for someone to be like, that was kind of fucking whack for my 20 bucks.
[17:19.190 --> 17:23.550]  Well, you went and hung out with Doug and then me and my boy drew took off.
[17:23.550 --> 17:24.550]  Yeah.
[17:24.550 --> 17:25.750]  We're all in stupidly enough.
[17:25.750 --> 17:29.550]  There were three carloads of people from Pueblo with one or two people in each car because
[17:29.550 --> 17:30.550]  we didn't plan.
[17:30.550 --> 17:31.550]  I had come from the cannabis cup.
[17:31.550 --> 17:32.550]  You came up on your own.
[17:32.550 --> 17:35.030]  And then I invited Danielle right after you left.
[17:35.030 --> 17:37.310]  I was already in monument by the time she hit me up.
[17:37.310 --> 17:38.310]  Well, she made it.
[17:38.710 --> 17:39.710]  So I'm proud of her.
[17:39.710 --> 17:40.710]  Super proud.
[17:40.710 --> 17:41.710]  She made that.
[17:41.710 --> 17:42.710]  But yeah, so we all had to get in separate cars.
[17:42.710 --> 17:45.710]  So once we linked up and talked about it, it was like, yeah, I felt like we kind of
[17:45.710 --> 17:48.430]  were his Guinea pigs test audience or something.
[17:48.430 --> 17:50.070]  A shout out to Graham Elwood.
[17:50.070 --> 17:51.310]  He saved the fucking show.
[17:51.310 --> 17:53.470]  Doug, I'm not being disrespectful to you, bro.
[17:53.470 --> 17:56.150]  I just feel like that third show, man, you were too high.
[17:56.150 --> 17:59.110]  And if I wasn't, I'm like a loyal Doug fan.
[17:59.110 --> 18:00.850]  So it was kind of neat for me to see that.
[18:00.850 --> 18:02.070]  Like I've seen enough Doug.
[18:02.070 --> 18:04.150]  That's why I'm watching my friend do comedy now, whatever.
[18:04.150 --> 18:05.510]  And I get VIP seats and shit.
[18:05.510 --> 18:10.590]  But if I was a normal civilian listener, I might not have been impressed with that show.
[18:10.590 --> 18:14.470]  Well, like I told you, the only interaction I've had with them is just listening to Doug
[18:14.470 --> 18:15.470]  loves movies.
[18:15.470 --> 18:16.910]  And so that's not a whole lot of Doug.
[18:16.910 --> 18:18.110]  That's a lot of everybody else.
[18:18.110 --> 18:19.110]  Right.
[18:19.110 --> 18:20.310]  I haven't watched Doug specials before.
[18:20.310 --> 18:23.630]  That was my first chance of seeing Doug Benson.
[18:23.630 --> 18:24.830]  And I was not impressed.
[18:24.830 --> 18:29.310]  I've said it on the podcast before that I think maybe Doug's excessive cannabis use
[18:29.310 --> 18:31.990]  may be slowing down his comedy and his career.
[18:31.990 --> 18:35.670]  And I think that our experience solidifies my theory.
[18:35.670 --> 18:36.670]  Yeah.
[18:36.670 --> 18:37.670]  Yeah.
[18:37.670 --> 18:39.430]  And that sucks because cannabis shouldn't be used as a slowing down.
[18:39.430 --> 18:41.790]  It should be used as a way to move yourself forward.
[18:41.790 --> 18:44.430]  Well, then, um, real quick.
[18:44.430 --> 18:48.430]  And we didn't bring this up before, but when, when there was that, he said, we're all going
[18:48.430 --> 18:49.430]  to go smoke outside.
[18:49.430 --> 18:50.430]  And I was like, all right, cool.
[18:50.430 --> 18:51.430]  So we'll go smoke.
[18:51.430 --> 18:53.630]  And there was what, like a hundred people, a lot of people.
[18:53.630 --> 18:55.270]  It was like a hundred people in that alleyway.
[18:55.270 --> 18:59.030]  I don't know if you guys have ever seen the comedy works alleyway, but it's probably 30
[18:59.030 --> 19:00.030]  feet wide.
[19:00.030 --> 19:01.030]  Yeah.
[19:01.070 --> 19:02.070]  I don't know.
[19:02.070 --> 19:03.070]  It's probably about 10 yards less.
[19:03.070 --> 19:05.630]  Well, I'm just trying to give it a little bit of room because, and a person on either
[19:05.630 --> 19:07.430]  side of the car, you know, I'm gonna say it's 10 feet wide.
[19:07.430 --> 19:08.430]  I feel it.
[19:08.430 --> 19:09.430]  Well, I don't know.
[19:09.430 --> 19:11.630]  Cause if a car goes down there, we all got to squeeze against the side.
[19:11.630 --> 19:12.990]  Yeah, I guess.
[19:12.990 --> 19:13.990]  All right.
[19:13.990 --> 19:18.150]  So, so we'll say 10 feet wide, maybe 15, but there was, there was like 75 to a hundred
[19:18.150 --> 19:19.150]  people.
[19:19.150 --> 19:20.150]  There were a lot of people in there.
[19:20.150 --> 19:23.070]  Um, and, and it started feeling real bro.
[19:23.070 --> 19:27.790]  He, while, while Doug was smoking, Doug had taken a hit of a joint and everybody would
[19:27.790 --> 19:32.230]  cheer for it as though he was like some hero, like coming home from war.
[19:32.230 --> 19:36.510]  And this was his first like step on American soil.
[19:36.510 --> 19:39.990]  It was fucking, it was just like, yeah, that's, that's it.
[19:39.990 --> 19:41.150]  Like we were doing it.
[19:41.150 --> 19:43.070]  We're outside in Colorado doing it.
[19:43.070 --> 19:47.870]  And it was just like, no, this is, this isn't the attitude I want to have around weed.
[19:47.870 --> 19:48.870]  Yeah.
[19:48.870 --> 19:49.870]  Yeah.
[19:49.870 --> 19:51.710]  It kind of wasn't, it seemed like we were taking tequila shots and everybody was high
[19:51.710 --> 19:53.230]  five over the tequila shots.
[19:53.230 --> 19:54.230]  Yeah.
[19:54.230 --> 19:55.230]  It got that way.
[19:55.230 --> 19:56.230]  Yeah.
[19:56.230 --> 19:57.230]  That's how I felt about it.
[19:57.670 --> 19:58.670]  I didn't stick around.
[19:58.670 --> 19:59.670]  I had to get home.
[19:59.670 --> 20:00.670]  I was tired.
[20:00.670 --> 20:03.550]  Actually, Doug usually hangs out and smokes with everybody, but he, uh, he smoked with
[20:03.550 --> 20:04.870]  a few people and then he knows me.
[20:04.870 --> 20:07.870]  So he actually turned to me and he said, Hey, Ross to Jeff, how are you, man?
[20:07.870 --> 20:08.870]  And how was your drive?
[20:08.870 --> 20:10.370]  Cause he knows I drive far.
[20:10.370 --> 20:14.350]  And when the crowd saw him, heard him address me, they fucking separated and let him and
[20:14.350 --> 20:16.670]  I kind of hang out and take some pictures and chill for a minute.
[20:16.670 --> 20:18.150]  And he shook my hand and left.
[20:18.150 --> 20:19.150]  He just wandered off.
[20:19.150 --> 20:20.150]  Yeah.
[20:20.150 --> 20:22.230]  There were still a lot of people there and he left.
[20:22.230 --> 20:26.350]  So I saw in Guyo at that point, uh, and Guyo Belem, you guys, if you know, and Guyo check
[20:26.470 --> 20:27.470]  him out.
[20:27.470 --> 20:28.470]  It's at, his name is a hard to spell.
[20:28.470 --> 20:32.630]  It's N G A I O four 20 at NGIO, NGIO four 20.
[20:32.630 --> 20:33.630]  Check him out on Twitter.
[20:33.630 --> 20:36.110]  Um, he's a cannabis activist.
[20:36.110 --> 20:38.150]  He is a podcaster.
[20:38.150 --> 20:40.750]  He's a, um, he's a comedian.
[20:40.750 --> 20:44.910]  He's a Jack of all trades, but he's definitely a pot smoker and a pot connoisseur.
[20:44.910 --> 20:46.230]  So I bumped into NGIO.
[20:46.230 --> 20:47.910]  We've been Twitter friends and whatnot.
[20:47.910 --> 20:51.390]  We've been in the same area, same industry for a long time, but I finally bumped into
[20:51.390 --> 20:52.950]  the dude and made friends with them.
[20:52.950 --> 20:54.670]  Uh, he followed me on Twitter.
[20:54.670 --> 20:57.430]  He followed our friend on Twitter.
[20:57.430 --> 21:01.670]  And then, uh, I thought that was the end of my meeting with NGIO.
[21:01.670 --> 21:03.430]  I thought we had met and shook hands and shit.
[21:03.430 --> 21:04.990]  So everybody went our separate ways.
[21:04.990 --> 21:07.590]  Clint drove home, like you said, cause he was tired.
[21:07.590 --> 21:10.230]  Obviously Drew needed a nap.
[21:10.230 --> 21:11.350]  He made it 30 minutes.
[21:11.350 --> 21:15.590]  I made sure Danielle got to her car safely and we all headed back South to the lovely
[21:15.590 --> 21:16.910]  city of Pueblo.
[21:16.910 --> 21:21.030]  Uh, Tuesday I had to drive almost all the way back.
[21:21.030 --> 21:23.990]  I drove up to the North end of Springs to meet up with some friends for some food that
[21:24.310 --> 21:25.830]  were leaving back to Cali.
[21:25.830 --> 21:32.390]  Um, I got to introduce, um, our friend Danielle to our friend, my friend Jay.
[21:32.390 --> 21:36.150]  They've been Twitter and Instagram friends for a long time and they finally got to meet
[21:36.150 --> 21:37.150]  up.
[21:37.150 --> 21:40.150]  So I put them two chicks in a parking lot, let them hula hoop together for a minute and
[21:40.150 --> 21:41.150]  it was great.
[21:41.150 --> 21:42.150]  Yeah.
[21:42.150 --> 21:43.150]  We got to make some friends out of those two.
[21:43.150 --> 21:44.150]  Shout out to them two ladies.
[21:44.150 --> 21:45.470]  So that was my Tuesday.
[21:45.470 --> 21:50.350]  Then Wednesday, Clint met me at my house, uh, right around four 20 ish.
[21:50.350 --> 21:53.910]  And then we boogied up to go see, um, mr.
[21:53.910 --> 21:57.110]  Greg groups record the world's smartest podcast.
[21:57.110 --> 21:58.670]  Uh, check that one out.
[21:58.670 --> 21:59.670]  It may lose some of you guys.
[21:59.670 --> 22:01.110]  Some of you guys may like it.
[22:01.110 --> 22:05.030]  Uh, Clint, I could tell that, uh, Clint was a little bit lost during the show.
[22:05.030 --> 22:09.830]  Yeah, it was either lost or it was just, I don't know.
[22:09.830 --> 22:10.950]  He gets a little ranty.
[22:10.950 --> 22:11.950]  You know how it is.
[22:11.950 --> 22:12.950]  Yeah.
[22:12.950 --> 22:14.270]  That's, he calls that the boring preachy part of his show.
[22:14.270 --> 22:19.230]  He definitely, that's a good portion of his show apparently because, uh, there was a lot
[22:19.230 --> 22:20.230]  of preachy parts.
[22:21.110 --> 22:22.110]  There was some joke parts at the start.
[22:22.110 --> 22:23.110]  They just take a little while.
[22:23.110 --> 22:27.110]  He's got like a lot of references and stuff that just, it just takes a while to get to
[22:27.110 --> 22:28.110]  things.
[22:28.110 --> 22:30.510]  I'm more of a, you know, let me hit you with the left and a right, right.
[22:30.510 --> 22:35.030]  Well, his comedy he's, he's doing a, he's a smart guy and I liked the guy and he's funny.
[22:35.030 --> 22:36.870]  Like some of the jokes he had were really funny.
[22:36.870 --> 22:40.470]  It just takes a little while to get there, but he's, I'm pretty sure he's like improv
[22:40.470 --> 22:41.470]  thing.
[22:41.470 --> 22:46.070]  All of that, all of that was so Wednesday was the podcast Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
[22:46.070 --> 22:49.450]  He's doing standup, which will be completely different than what you saw.
[22:49.670 --> 22:52.170]  And that's the thing is like improv is a different thing to me.
[22:52.170 --> 22:53.170]  You know what I mean?
[22:53.170 --> 22:57.530]  Like, uh, I do standup, I don't do improv and it's nothing against improv.
[22:57.530 --> 22:58.850]  I just don't do it.
[22:58.850 --> 23:00.850]  Um, so I don't know those skills.
[23:00.850 --> 23:05.650]  Like those guys are better, uh, at many, many things, but I think just getting to the joke
[23:05.650 --> 23:10.750]  and keeping people laughing, that's where standup reigns and keeping you engaged and
[23:10.750 --> 23:11.750]  stuff like that.
[23:11.750 --> 23:16.650]  Now improv is kind of like, well, let's try to figure out how do we get back to this like
[23:16.850 --> 23:18.050]  neutral points or whatever.
[23:18.050 --> 23:20.450]  So that way we can make it funny.
[23:20.450 --> 23:24.810]  But those guys, that's a challenge and a half, but the audience is a little bit more, uh,
[23:24.810 --> 23:26.210]  gives you more leeway with that.
[23:26.210 --> 23:27.210]  Oh yeah.
[23:27.210 --> 23:28.210]  You know what I mean?
[23:28.210 --> 23:31.370]  So maybe you guys know in the podcast, we're giving him more leeway than I was.
[23:31.370 --> 23:33.770]  Well I am, I'm not there just for the funny.
[23:33.770 --> 23:39.330]  I'm expecting to be, um, enlightened a little by Greg educated, slightly offended at some
[23:39.330 --> 23:40.330]  points.
[23:40.330 --> 23:43.050]  Um, I know he's a thinking man's comedian.
[23:43.050 --> 23:45.370]  You have to, and he calls himself the world's smartest man.
[23:45.370 --> 23:46.930]  It's not, it's, that's a joke.
[23:46.930 --> 23:49.170]  That's just a, but it's, he's a smart dude.
[23:49.170 --> 23:50.170]  He's a smart sucker.
[23:50.170 --> 23:51.170]  And he's been doing improv.
[23:51.170 --> 23:54.490]  We, you asked him how long you've been doing comedy and he just shook his head at you.
[23:54.490 --> 23:57.650]  I think he just wanted to say like longer than you've been alive.
[23:57.650 --> 24:01.330]  And that was what I was, but, but, uh, and, and I wasn't trying to say like, Oh, how long
[24:01.330 --> 24:05.170]  you've been, I was just wanting to ask him like, well, how long, you know, this is like
[24:05.170 --> 24:07.570]  a goal of mine to be you.
[24:07.570 --> 24:11.930]  And he kind of did kind of just dismiss me as though I was saying it like an asshole.
[24:11.930 --> 24:14.210]  But what I meant like was all respect.
[24:14.210 --> 24:18.930]  Like dude, like I just, I just want to know that there is the possibility that in like,
[24:18.930 --> 24:21.010]  you've been doing this for 30 years.
[24:21.010 --> 24:22.290]  That's what it takes to get to you.
[24:22.290 --> 24:23.290]  Cool, man.
[24:23.290 --> 24:24.290]  I'd love to.
[24:24.290 --> 24:25.290]  Yeah.
[24:25.290 --> 24:26.290]  He's that's where I want to be.
[24:26.290 --> 24:27.290]  And you guys, he's the one from whose line is it anyway?
[24:27.290 --> 24:28.290]  Has the name of the show, right?
[24:28.290 --> 24:29.290]  Whose line?
[24:29.290 --> 24:30.290]  Yeah.
[24:30.290 --> 24:31.290]  Whose line is it anyways?
[24:31.290 --> 24:32.570]  One of the, that's one of the shows that this guy is on.
[24:32.570 --> 24:36.530]  He's a no offense to Greg, but he's probably the one that you call the gay one.
[24:36.530 --> 24:37.890]  Yeah, he's not.
[24:37.890 --> 24:41.050]  He's got a beautiful wife named Jennifer and he is completely straight and he stands up
[24:41.050 --> 24:42.050]  for women's rights.
[24:42.050 --> 24:45.410]  And he's just got like a little bit of a high, uh, irritating voice.
[24:45.410 --> 24:46.730]  Do you know what I mean?
[24:46.730 --> 24:50.410]  Like I don't mean like super irritating, but it's just like, I probably wouldn't want to
[24:50.410 --> 24:51.410]  marry that guy.
[24:51.410 --> 24:53.250]  Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
[24:53.250 --> 24:54.810]  I think I'm all right with that.
[24:54.810 --> 24:56.970]  His voice made it to where I didn't want to marry him.
[24:56.970 --> 24:58.970]  Nothing else about that situation.
[24:58.970 --> 25:01.250]  He wears a suit all of the time.
[25:01.250 --> 25:06.170]  He had a suit with an, uh, kind of an, uh, it's a bluish jacket with a purple shirt underneath
[25:06.170 --> 25:08.730]  it and he had a purple hanky in one pocket.
[25:09.130 --> 25:13.130]  And at one point he pulled out a hanky out of his jacket pocket to do a joke.
[25:13.130 --> 25:18.410]  And the hanky out of his pocket was perfectly pressed and it was purple and it had gold
[25:18.410 --> 25:20.010]  pinstriping on it, dude.
[25:20.010 --> 25:22.710]  His pocket hanky was fucking stylish.
[25:22.710 --> 25:25.210]  Like this dude is stylish from head to toe.
[25:25.210 --> 25:26.890]  His shoes were sharp.
[25:26.890 --> 25:31.330]  The only thing that shocked me about the man was, uh, so we saw the comp, we saw him record
[25:31.330 --> 25:32.850]  a show while he's recording the show.
[25:32.850 --> 25:36.390]  I looked to the right and I see NGIO sitting backstage at comedy works.
[25:36.390 --> 25:39.370]  So I was like, we're going to hang out with NGIO and Greg, watch this.
[25:39.370 --> 25:43.670]  So after the show, uh, we get bustled out.
[25:43.670 --> 25:46.310]  And after a couple of times of me looking over at Clint and he's looking like he's going
[25:46.310 --> 25:47.310]  to fall asleep.
[25:47.310 --> 25:49.430]  Also shout out to our friend Joe, our friend Joe met up with us.
[25:49.430 --> 25:50.430]  Yeah.
[25:50.430 --> 25:51.430]  What's up Joe?
[25:51.430 --> 25:52.430]  We almost left Joe out.
[25:52.430 --> 25:53.430]  Sorry about that.
[25:53.430 --> 25:54.430]  Joe joined us for the comedy show.
[25:54.430 --> 25:55.430]  Joe had a great time.
[25:55.430 --> 25:56.430]  Joe was a huge proofs fan.
[25:56.430 --> 25:59.510]  So, uh, I looked over and Greg's kind of, or, uh, Clint's kind of fallen asleep a couple
[25:59.510 --> 26:00.510]  of times.
[26:00.510 --> 26:03.310]  And then after the show, we're looking for the guys and we can't find them.
[26:03.310 --> 26:05.830]  And a friend of mine is like, dude, they're down here in this area smoking.
[26:06.270 --> 26:09.030]  And so we just walk back there and I walked back there and I could hear NGIO from a block
[26:09.030 --> 26:10.030]  away.
[26:10.030 --> 26:11.030]  He's got a very recognizable voice.
[26:11.030 --> 26:13.710]  So we walked down the stairs and they're just hanging out smoking.
[26:13.710 --> 26:16.770]  So, uh, NGIO greets me and knew my name.
[26:16.770 --> 26:19.150]  And then I introduced myself to Greg Proops.
[26:19.150 --> 26:20.150]  He sticks out his hand.
[26:20.150 --> 26:21.150]  We shake hands.
[26:21.150 --> 26:22.150]  I asked if we're interrupting.
[26:22.150 --> 26:24.470]  They said, no, I lit a joint.
[26:24.470 --> 26:26.470]  That's just what I felt like needed to happen.
[26:26.470 --> 26:29.950]  So then we started hanging out with these guys for, we hung out for an hour.
[26:29.950 --> 26:30.950]  Yeah.
[26:30.950 --> 26:31.950]  About an hour.
[26:31.950 --> 26:34.030]  One of the things I was going to say, what I led onto was the thing that shocked me about
[26:34.030 --> 26:35.030]  Greg.
[26:35.230 --> 26:36.230]  Smoking cigarettes.
[26:36.230 --> 26:38.710]  I never would have guessed Greg Proops smoke cigarettes.
[26:38.710 --> 26:39.710]  I don't know why.
[26:39.710 --> 26:41.190]  You would have thought that he was smarter than that.
[26:41.190 --> 26:42.190]  Is that what you're saying?
[26:42.190 --> 26:43.190]  I think so.
[26:43.190 --> 26:44.190]  Yes.
[26:44.190 --> 26:45.190]  Nothing against you.
[26:45.190 --> 26:46.190]  Cigarette smokers.
[26:46.190 --> 26:47.190]  I know.
[26:47.190 --> 26:49.390]  Cause I, I have just recently finally got, I quit my e-cig too.
[26:49.390 --> 26:50.390]  Nice.
[26:50.390 --> 26:51.390]  I quit all that nicotine shit.
[26:51.390 --> 26:52.390]  Very cool.
[26:52.390 --> 26:54.990]  I'm just doing weed now, which you know, hit and miss.
[26:54.990 --> 26:56.710]  That's, that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[26:56.710 --> 26:58.030]  You know, that's better for you.
[26:58.030 --> 27:00.510]  Well, it's better for me, but it could also get me fired from my job.
[27:00.510 --> 27:01.510]  Oh yeah.
[27:01.510 --> 27:02.910]  Well, this, this guy's name is not Clint.
[27:02.910 --> 27:04.790]  This is Bobby McGee here.
[27:05.550 --> 27:07.550]  Welcome to the grow from your heart podcast.
[27:07.550 --> 27:09.550]  My name is Bob and McGee.
[27:09.550 --> 27:10.550]  Anyway.
[27:10.550 --> 27:13.230]  No, I understand cutting cigarettes out as hard.
[27:13.230 --> 27:15.350]  And but Greg Proops doing it.
[27:15.350 --> 27:18.110]  It just, it was like, wow, that's that, that was weird.
[27:18.110 --> 27:19.390]  And it stunk too.
[27:19.390 --> 27:23.310]  That's kind of, it was so weird that like I smell his cigarette worse than I could smell
[27:23.310 --> 27:24.870]  all the dankness around us.
[27:24.870 --> 27:26.110]  A shout out to NGIO.
[27:26.110 --> 27:30.830]  He pulled out some tangy from Cali that had some stink and some flavor to it.
[27:30.830 --> 27:31.830]  That tangy was delicious.
[27:31.830 --> 27:33.230]  I didn't get a chance to try.
[27:33.230 --> 27:34.230]  I smelt it.
[27:34.670 --> 27:36.270]  I think it was already too high by the time he had pulled that out.
[27:36.270 --> 27:37.270]  I smelt it though.
[27:37.270 --> 27:40.270]  I think my platinum OG trumped it.
[27:40.270 --> 27:41.270]  The platinum.
[27:41.270 --> 27:44.270]  He was, I gave him the last of my platinum OG that I had with me and he looked quite
[27:44.270 --> 27:45.270]  impressed with it.
[27:45.270 --> 27:47.750]  He was, uh, he was, and he was a nice guy too.
[27:47.750 --> 27:49.050]  So NGIO is a great dude.
[27:49.050 --> 27:50.050]  That is true.
[27:50.050 --> 27:54.150]  We smoked with these guys for like an hour and they were talking to us, not at us, not
[27:54.150 --> 27:55.150]  about us.
[27:55.150 --> 27:57.270]  Like we were just hanging out with normal people.
[27:57.270 --> 27:59.770]  At one point, Greg Proops was telling a baseball story.
[27:59.770 --> 28:00.770]  Go figure.
[28:00.770 --> 28:04.090]  If you know anything about Proops, you know, he's a huge baseball fan and he was talking
[28:04.950 --> 28:09.970]  about a player leading off of first blade base in a celebration.
[28:09.970 --> 28:14.790]  And then the umpire yelled play ball and the guy just stayed way off of first blade base.
[28:14.790 --> 28:18.790]  And so the first baseman reaches over with the ball and tags him out.
[28:18.790 --> 28:24.110]  And as he talks about tagging him out, he damn near punched me in the titty because
[28:24.110 --> 28:27.350]  he tagged me out as like a physical act to show what happened.
[28:27.350 --> 28:28.350]  But he was being cool.
[28:28.350 --> 28:29.350]  No, he was just hanging out.
[28:29.350 --> 28:35.610]  And that story was the Kansas City Royals own George Brett for all the stoner fucking
[28:35.610 --> 28:36.610]  baseball fans.
[28:36.610 --> 28:38.570]  That was the story you were, that we were being told.
[28:38.570 --> 28:39.570]  3000th hit.
[28:39.570 --> 28:40.570]  Look it up on YouTube.
[28:40.570 --> 28:41.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:41.570 --> 28:42.570]  That's exactly it.
[28:42.570 --> 28:43.570]  He was celebrating his 3000th hit.
[28:43.570 --> 28:47.690]  But so when Proops was acting out the smack, he smacked me and looked at me like I was
[28:47.690 --> 28:48.690]  his buddy.
[28:48.690 --> 28:52.290]  And I tried not to light up like a school girl because I was stupid excited, but I thought
[28:52.290 --> 28:53.570]  it was pretty awesome.
[28:53.570 --> 28:54.890]  Greg Proops is one of my heroes.
[28:54.890 --> 29:01.150]  I'm a comedy nerd and he's a comedy legend and I'm a podcaster and he's got a great podcast.
[29:01.150 --> 29:07.430]  So something about and he's articulate and he makes me speak and write better.
[29:07.430 --> 29:12.430]  He actually makes me more conscious of my vocabulary in my mouth when I'm trying and
[29:12.430 --> 29:14.550]  when I'm not super dabbed out.
[29:14.550 --> 29:16.310]  He's he was really funny.
[29:16.310 --> 29:19.830]  You know, there was some really funny parts to Doug too, though, you know, but you know,
[29:19.830 --> 29:24.790]  between the shows, I had a rough weekend because I was going to say, you know, but Graham
[29:25.690 --> 29:26.690]  Elliott, that was my favorite.
[29:26.690 --> 29:27.690]  Elwood, Elwood, Graham Elwood.
[29:27.690 --> 29:28.690]  Graham Elwood.
[29:28.690 --> 29:29.690]  Yes.
[29:29.690 --> 29:31.010]  As I said, yes, just like he wasn't recorded or anything.
[29:31.010 --> 29:32.010]  Was it?
[29:32.010 --> 29:33.010]  No, nobody else.
[29:33.010 --> 29:34.010]  I hear that.
[29:34.010 --> 29:37.610]  Anyway, Graham Graham was my favorite of the little excursion.
[29:37.610 --> 29:39.370]  Clint is kind of owed a comedy show.
[29:39.370 --> 29:40.850]  You've got comedy blue balls right now.
[29:40.850 --> 29:45.450]  I'd assume it's fucking a little comedy tug.
[29:45.450 --> 29:46.450]  Yeah.
[29:46.450 --> 29:47.450]  May 10th.
[29:47.450 --> 29:48.450]  That'll be funny.
[29:48.450 --> 29:49.450]  May 10th.
[29:49.450 --> 29:50.450]  It'll be fun.
[29:50.450 --> 29:51.450]  May 10th.
[29:51.450 --> 29:52.450]  Maybe when Guy will come back, you know, that would be nice.
[29:52.450 --> 29:53.450]  That'd be cool.
[29:53.450 --> 29:54.450]  It'd be cool to see him.
[29:55.110 --> 29:58.110]  I'd love to know who is going to be on that, but I'm going to have my or my name tag ready.
[29:58.110 --> 29:59.110]  There you go.
[29:59.110 --> 30:01.630]  I don't know if I want to take my old I've got a name tag made guys.
[30:01.630 --> 30:04.030]  If you don't know what we're talking about when you go see Doug Benson, do Doug love
[30:04.030 --> 30:05.030]  movie Doug loves movies.
[30:05.030 --> 30:06.150]  You got to take a name tag with you.
[30:06.150 --> 30:08.790]  I don't know if I want to take my old name tag or found a print up a new one.
[30:08.790 --> 30:10.510]  I'll just take your old one.
[30:10.510 --> 30:11.510]  There you go.
[30:11.510 --> 30:12.510]  Yeah.
[30:12.510 --> 30:13.510]  You be me.
[30:13.510 --> 30:15.350]  God, you're the laziest motherfucker.
[30:15.350 --> 30:18.670]  So we've got Doug loves movies on May 10th.
[30:18.670 --> 30:20.630]  Joey Diaz coming up after that.
[30:20.630 --> 30:21.630]  Yeah.
[30:21.630 --> 30:22.990]  And that's June in June.
[30:22.990 --> 30:24.310]  And then what else do we have coming up?
[30:25.170 --> 30:26.170]  Brian Callen show.
[30:26.170 --> 30:27.170]  Brian Callen.
[30:27.170 --> 30:28.170]  I think it sounds like I'm going to see Brian Callen guys.
[30:28.170 --> 30:30.050]  I got to start listening to more Brian Callen.
[30:30.050 --> 30:31.050]  You don't have to.
[30:31.050 --> 30:32.050]  That's a take somebody.
[30:32.050 --> 30:33.050]  I'm all I'm all.
[30:33.050 --> 30:34.730]  Well, you know, I'm all about seeing some Brian.
[30:34.730 --> 30:36.130]  That's why the fighter and the kid.
[30:36.130 --> 30:37.130]  Right.
[30:37.130 --> 30:38.130]  Yeah, dude.
[30:38.130 --> 30:39.690]  No, it's it's it's going to be fun, dude.
[30:39.690 --> 30:41.170]  That's the thing is it's just fun going.
[30:41.170 --> 30:45.370]  You know, that's the thing is like I'm not going to complain about this like these couple
[30:45.370 --> 30:47.730]  of days because they were fun days.
[30:47.730 --> 30:51.570]  And and it's funny that I can still be a little bit like it wasn't that great.
[30:51.830 --> 30:54.830]  But we hung out with proops and Nungayo for a fucking hour.
[30:54.830 --> 30:57.430]  Yeah, for an hour and just smoke like bros.
[30:57.430 --> 30:58.430]  Yeah.
[30:58.430 --> 30:59.430]  Yeah.
[30:59.430 --> 31:00.430]  So I don't know what the hell I'm complaining about.
[31:00.430 --> 31:01.670]  And I could have probably smoked with Doug.
[31:01.670 --> 31:03.470]  I just didn't feel like hopping in that crowd.
[31:03.470 --> 31:04.670]  Yeah, that was a big crowd.
[31:04.670 --> 31:07.910]  But we're going to see Doug here in like two weeks.
[31:07.910 --> 31:10.550]  So everything's good, man.
[31:10.550 --> 31:11.550]  Mother's Day, guys.
[31:11.550 --> 31:15.390]  Have we mentioned that Mother's Day is how high are we?
[31:15.390 --> 31:16.390]  Remember that opener?
[31:16.390 --> 31:17.390]  Yeah.
[31:17.390 --> 31:18.390]  Cold open looking from Clint.
[31:18.390 --> 31:19.390]  30 minutes ago.
[31:19.390 --> 31:20.390]  All right.
[31:20.390 --> 31:21.390]  We've been going for 30 minutes.
[31:22.210 --> 31:23.210]  That's pretty good.
[31:23.210 --> 31:25.470]  You got anything else you want to add about the the comedy shows before we start wrapping
[31:25.470 --> 31:28.010]  it up and moving on to different subjects?
[31:28.010 --> 31:32.570]  Again, Comedy Works is one of the best clubs.
[31:32.570 --> 31:34.490]  If you haven't been there, please go check it out.
[31:34.490 --> 31:35.730]  It doesn't matter who you go see.
[31:35.730 --> 31:37.890]  It's going to be fun.
[31:37.890 --> 31:40.490]  It's we have great service there all the time.
[31:40.490 --> 31:43.610]  They got waitresses running all over the place.
[31:43.610 --> 31:47.250]  And with us, you know, we're doing every Thursday down here in Pueblo.
[31:47.250 --> 31:51.370]  So if you want to see open mic comedy, we're still doing that every Thursday at the Rainbow
[31:52.350 --> 31:53.990]  at the Rainbow on Santa Fe.
[31:53.990 --> 31:56.910]  And guys, I know I keep talking about being VIP at Comedy Works and they treat me like
[31:56.910 --> 31:57.910]  a pimp.
[31:57.910 --> 31:59.630]  They will treat you like a pimp as well.
[31:59.630 --> 32:02.430]  They treat everybody like a rock star there.
[32:02.430 --> 32:06.190]  I'm just six five with dreadlocks and they recognize my high ass every time.
[32:06.190 --> 32:08.350]  So they remember me and I've made friends.
[32:08.350 --> 32:10.470]  And we're coming back kind of, you know, frequently.
[32:10.470 --> 32:11.470]  Yeah, fairly frequently.
[32:11.470 --> 32:16.310]  And I bring dank, dank weed and I might smoke out in the back every time and they recognize
[32:16.310 --> 32:17.310]  me.
[32:17.310 --> 32:18.310]  That might happen.
[32:18.310 --> 32:21.370]  They smell you coming before they see your fucking six five.
[32:21.370 --> 32:26.010]  Yeah, Ross, it's fun when you take take a date with you who's never really hung out
[32:26.010 --> 32:29.530]  with you out in public a lot and you take her to a comedy show and everybody at the
[32:29.530 --> 32:32.650]  Comedy Works, one hundred and twenty five miles from your house, high fives you and
[32:32.650 --> 32:33.770]  knows you by name.
[32:33.770 --> 32:36.050]  That's fucking the comedians know you by name.
[32:36.050 --> 32:37.730]  Like that's that's a way to take a chick out.
[32:37.730 --> 32:41.330]  And she was like, what is pretty neat, dude.
[32:41.330 --> 32:43.730]  I do want to go to the Cannabis Cup with you next year, though.
[32:43.730 --> 32:46.730]  I don't know if you do, because, oh, I ain't smoking a whole bunch.
[32:46.750 --> 32:51.030]  I'm just saying every 10 feet, it's I get stopped and start a new conversation every
[32:51.030 --> 32:52.430]  10 feet, every 10 feet.
[32:52.430 --> 32:54.230]  So, yeah, put a bag over your head.
[32:54.230 --> 32:55.710]  That's what you throw some dreadlocks on.
[32:55.710 --> 32:56.950]  They'll think that I am you.
[32:56.950 --> 32:57.950]  There we go.
[32:57.950 --> 32:58.950]  The same height.
[32:58.950 --> 32:59.950]  We are close to the same height.
[32:59.950 --> 33:00.950]  You could be my brother.
[33:00.950 --> 33:02.110]  That brother from another work.
[33:02.110 --> 33:06.310]  And I'll just I'll just kind of be like, yeah, man, like, no, I'm just really high and I
[33:06.310 --> 33:07.470]  just won't even open my eyes.
[33:07.470 --> 33:08.870]  You'll have sunglasses anyway.
[33:08.870 --> 33:09.870]  If you're being me.
[33:09.870 --> 33:11.430]  See, here we go, man.
[33:11.430 --> 33:12.430]  We're on it.
[33:12.430 --> 33:13.430]  All right.
[33:13.430 --> 33:14.430]  I just need an I region X shirt.
[33:14.430 --> 33:19.090]  I need to find a drone of me so that I can go kick it.
[33:19.090 --> 33:23.250]  He's still he's still running around just somewhere else.
[33:23.250 --> 33:24.250]  We take breaks.
[33:24.250 --> 33:26.770]  We're on and off on ship.
[33:26.770 --> 33:27.770]  Yeah.
[33:27.770 --> 33:28.770]  You need to be me for five hours.
[33:28.770 --> 33:29.770]  You get the morning shift.
[33:29.770 --> 33:30.770]  I'm good in the mornings.
[33:30.770 --> 33:31.770]  There you go.
[33:31.770 --> 33:33.570]  There's no people out there in the morning.
[33:33.570 --> 33:34.570]  I'll take that shift.
[33:34.570 --> 33:36.050]  Plenty of people out there in the morning.
[33:36.050 --> 33:37.890]  It was crazy this this time in the mornings.
[33:37.890 --> 33:39.770]  Well, I guess you said that on the last podcast.
[33:39.770 --> 33:41.450]  You talked about on the last one.
[33:41.450 --> 33:42.450]  Yeah.
[33:42.450 --> 33:43.450]  Yeah.
[33:43.470 --> 33:44.470]  I was like, I'm busy.
[33:44.470 --> 33:45.470]  Yeah.
[33:45.470 --> 33:46.470]  How many people are running around?
[33:46.470 --> 33:47.470]  There were thousands of people there.
[33:47.470 --> 33:50.670]  I never looked for the official ticket sales to see how many people were there.
[33:50.670 --> 33:51.910]  Thousands there were people that I know.
[33:51.910 --> 33:52.910]  I'm good on that one.
[33:52.910 --> 33:53.910]  But thanks.
[33:53.910 --> 33:55.270]  There are people that I did not get to see.
[33:55.270 --> 33:58.310]  He just tried to pass me a bowl of flowers and I turned it down because flowers really
[33:58.310 --> 34:00.550]  give me stupid bad cotton mouth on the show.
[34:00.550 --> 34:02.150]  I'll take a dab, though.
[34:02.150 --> 34:04.750]  I'm going to take a dab.
[34:04.750 --> 34:06.790]  So you said Thursdays at the Rainbow Bar.
[34:06.790 --> 34:09.630]  Thursday at the Rainbow Bar, 9 p.m.
[34:09.630 --> 34:10.630]  Come check it out.
[34:10.630 --> 34:15.090]  You know, Wild Cousins just trying to keep keep going.
[34:15.090 --> 34:21.370]  You know, it's tough because we're not in the big city doing the big boy shows and stuff.
[34:21.370 --> 34:25.130]  Now my boy John Blaine was starting to take off.
[34:25.130 --> 34:28.090]  He's going to he's really given 100 percent to it.
[34:28.090 --> 34:29.090]  Good.
[34:29.090 --> 34:32.250]  I really think that he's going to be one of the first guys out of Pueblo to really because
[34:32.250 --> 34:33.850]  he's funny.
[34:33.850 --> 34:36.970]  He's a good guy and he's he wants it.
[34:36.970 --> 34:40.570]  I saw his post about doing some show where he's hosting it.
[34:41.510 --> 34:44.630]  Yeah, I think he's going up to Longmont to host some.
[34:44.630 --> 34:46.030]  I don't remember who it was either.
[34:46.030 --> 34:48.910]  Is there a cover charge for your show on Thursdays at the Rainbow?
[34:48.910 --> 34:51.990]  The Rainbow is free every Thursday.
[34:51.990 --> 34:53.590]  Free come see some free comedy, guys.
[34:53.590 --> 34:56.610]  It's open micers, but we might get some weird shit here.
[34:56.610 --> 34:57.610]  We should be cool.
[34:57.610 --> 34:58.610]  Everything should have worked.
[34:58.610 --> 35:00.110]  I think everything's cool still happening.
[35:00.110 --> 35:01.110]  Yeah.
[35:01.110 --> 35:02.110]  Yeah.
[35:02.110 --> 35:03.110]  So those shows are going to be free.
[35:03.110 --> 35:04.110]  Welcome backers.
[35:04.110 --> 35:05.110]  Yeah.
[35:05.110 --> 35:06.110]  Oh, they didn't miss shit.
[35:06.110 --> 35:09.490]  Hopefully we're going to have to go back and look because it's got me sketched out.
[35:09.490 --> 35:11.490]  So yeah, I hope all that recorded, guys.
[35:11.490 --> 35:17.410]  Welcome to part two because we just recorded part one.
[35:17.410 --> 35:18.410]  It's missing.
[35:18.410 --> 35:21.470]  It looks like everything worked, but I could tell the garage band was pissed off at me
[35:21.470 --> 35:22.470]  for a second there.
[35:22.470 --> 35:24.910]  There was an update on the computer and everything's still kind of wonky.
[35:24.910 --> 35:28.530]  But so yeah, I'm about to take this dab is what I was going to do.
[35:28.530 --> 35:30.910]  The free shows, you'll see some open micers there.
[35:30.910 --> 35:33.750]  What type of who will we see at these open mic events on a Thursday?
[35:33.750 --> 35:34.750]  Who do you think will show up?
[35:34.750 --> 35:37.750]  Oh, you know, we got a lot of guys.
[35:37.750 --> 35:40.370]  I'm going to get back after it.
[35:40.370 --> 35:43.170]  I took a little bit of a break, but I got to get back after it.
[35:43.170 --> 35:48.630]  And then my boy, Paul Rosales, he's a, he's there every Thursday.
[35:48.630 --> 35:49.630]  Really funny guy.
[35:49.630 --> 35:54.130]  If you guys listened to the episode 62 wild cousins, he was the funny one.
[35:54.130 --> 35:55.130]  Yeah.
[35:55.130 --> 35:56.130]  He was the funny one.
[35:56.130 --> 35:57.130]  That's looking for a dude to hook up with.
[35:57.130 --> 35:58.130]  Dude.
[35:58.130 --> 35:59.130]  I fucking, that shit was funny.
[35:59.130 --> 36:00.130]  Oh, we had a good time.
[36:00.130 --> 36:01.610]  He's he's really funny.
[36:01.610 --> 36:06.030]  Um, uh, John Blaine was, like I said, really, really funny.
[36:06.030 --> 36:07.730]  We've got other guys coming through.
[36:07.730 --> 36:09.730]  Um, sometimes it's brand new guys.
[36:09.730 --> 36:13.210]  If you're a brand new guy and you want to try comedy, there's no better place than the
[36:13.210 --> 36:15.090]  rainbow gal or yeah, please.
[36:15.090 --> 36:16.090]  I'm sorry.
[36:16.090 --> 36:18.850]  I meant when I say dude, I mean guy and gal.
[36:18.850 --> 36:23.090]  And when I say it's all unisex guy, I just mean anybody.
[36:23.090 --> 36:25.730]  I really don't mean it as like only guys can do whatever.
[36:25.730 --> 36:26.730]  Right.
[36:26.730 --> 36:27.730]  No, no, no.
[36:27.730 --> 36:28.730]  Weird.
[36:28.730 --> 36:29.730]  I wish more ladies had come out.
[36:29.730 --> 36:30.730]  They don't, they don't want to do it anyway.
[36:30.730 --> 36:31.730]  Maybe I'm intimidating.
[36:31.730 --> 36:35.570]  I'm six foot five, four foot dreadlocks.
[36:36.110 --> 36:37.110]  You should see Clint's dreads.
[36:37.110 --> 36:38.110]  They're intimidating.
[36:38.110 --> 36:39.110]  Not really.
[36:39.110 --> 36:40.110]  Come on.
[36:40.110 --> 36:41.110]  It'll get no dread dread.
[36:41.110 --> 36:42.110]  Anyway.

[36:43.110 --> 36:44.110]  Any specific dates?
[36:44.110 --> 36:45.110]  No, not right now.
[36:45.110 --> 36:46.110]  Uh, just, uh, Mother's Day.
[36:46.110 --> 36:47.110]  That's it.
[36:47.110 --> 36:48.110]  Mother's Day.
[36:48.110 --> 36:49.110]  Yes.
[36:49.110 --> 36:50.110]  He's taking your mom out.
[36:50.110 --> 36:51.110]  No, I don't mean that.
[36:51.110 --> 36:52.110]  You take your mom out.
[36:52.110 --> 36:53.110]  Take your own mothers out.
[36:53.110 --> 36:54.110]  Take them to dinner.
[36:54.110 --> 36:55.110]  Or do it on the ninth.
[36:55.110 --> 36:56.110]  I don't know.
[36:56.110 --> 36:57.790]  Make sure you guys follow Clint on Instagram and Twitter.
[36:57.790 --> 36:58.790]  It's at tall Clint.
[36:58.790 --> 36:59.790]  At tall Clint.
[36:59.790 --> 37:02.150]  Uh, he hasn't been posting a lot lately, but he's getting back into it.
[37:02.150 --> 37:04.110]  He took kind of a hiatus to get his shit together.
[37:04.130 --> 37:05.130]  We respect that.
[37:05.130 --> 37:06.130]  Fuck yeah.
[37:06.130 --> 37:08.410]  But the social media takes a lot of your damn time.
[37:08.410 --> 37:12.970]  I've noticed like I post a lot and then I catch myself like, Oh, I've been on here for
[37:12.970 --> 37:13.970]  30 minutes.
[37:13.970 --> 37:16.970]  I gotta wipe and get out of here.
[37:16.970 --> 37:19.970]  I didn't see that coming.
[37:19.970 --> 37:20.970]  Either did I.
[37:20.970 --> 37:21.970]  Either did I.
[37:21.970 --> 37:22.970]  I came back to.
[37:22.970 --> 37:23.970]  Oh, you proopsed it.
[37:23.970 --> 37:24.970]  All right.

[37:41.230 --> 37:42.230]  Let us know what you think.
[37:42.230 --> 37:43.230]  This one was a little rambly.
[37:43.230 --> 37:44.230]  I apologize.
[37:44.230 --> 37:46.310]  It was a lot of rambly, but sometimes you got to cut loose and have a comedy show instead
[37:46.310 --> 37:47.750]  of all about uptight weed.
[37:47.750 --> 37:49.950]  I'm pretty sure you guys are getting a lot of weed anyway.
[37:49.950 --> 37:52.070]  And if you made it this far, good job.
[37:52.070 --> 37:53.070]  Yeah.
[37:53.070 --> 37:54.070]  Yeah.
[37:54.070 --> 37:56.870]  Um, make sure you clean the filters in your air conditioners and calibrate your pH meters.
[37:56.870 --> 37:57.870]  There you go.
[37:57.870 --> 37:59.790]  That was some weed advice for the show.
[37:59.790 --> 38:00.790]  You did it.
[38:00.790 --> 38:01.790]  Yeah.
[38:01.790 --> 38:02.790]  We got some in there.
[38:03.410 --> 38:09.490]  And also, uh, make sure that they don't have centipedes cause those are scary.
[38:09.490 --> 38:10.490]  There you go.
[38:10.490 --> 38:11.490]  You heard it from Clint.
[38:11.490 --> 38:12.490]  Centipedes are scary.
[38:12.490 --> 38:13.490]  All right, guys.
[38:13.490 --> 38:14.490]  Thanks for listening.
[38:14.490 --> 38:15.490]  I'm going to be back in a few days with another episode.
