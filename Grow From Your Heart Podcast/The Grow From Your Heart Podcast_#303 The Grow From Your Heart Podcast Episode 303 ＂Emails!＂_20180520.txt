[00:00.320 --> 00:05.120]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.120 --> 00:07.880]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.880 --> 00:12.180]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:12.180 --> 00:15.360]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:15.360 --> 00:17.560]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.560 --> 00:22.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:22.280 --> 00:27.120]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.440]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:28.440 --> 00:32.760]  It's time for episode 303 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, of course, a Thursday
[00:32.760 --> 00:33.760]  quickie.
[00:33.760 --> 00:34.760]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:34.760 --> 00:38.000]  I like to start these episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.200]  Today, I've been getting down on the Clementine high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[00:43.200 --> 00:47.440]  Of course, if you listen to the podcast frequently, you know I get down on the Clementine a lot.
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.120]  Oftentimes, I've complained that the Clementine lacks in high, but has a great flavor.
[00:52.120 --> 00:57.040]  I've been smoking the high cannabinoid full spectrum extracts, and this shit is not lacking
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.240]  in anything.
[00:58.240 --> 01:03.040]  It's got the high, it's got the flavor, it's got a head buzz that you could not forget,
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.360]  but you could forget your keys.
[01:04.360 --> 01:05.800]  You could forget where you are.
[01:05.800 --> 01:08.000]  This is a great concentrate for during the day.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  It gets me moving.
[01:09.000 --> 01:10.080]  It doesn't make me lazy.
[01:10.080 --> 01:12.400]  I've been enjoying that all day today.
[01:12.400 --> 01:15.920]  The car smells like lemons just from having this in the car with me.
[01:15.920 --> 01:19.700]  The cooler smells like oranges and pineapples just from keeping it in the cooler.
[01:19.700 --> 01:21.520]  This is a tremendous concentrate.
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.160]  Then I got home, and I wanted to switch things up a little bit, kick off the shoes, and chill
[01:25.160 --> 01:26.320]  out and do a podcast.
[01:26.400 --> 01:31.080]  That's when I started smoking on the Tahoe OG Live Batter.
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.080]  This one's got me just kind of mellow, just kind of chilled out, able to sit down in a
[01:35.080 --> 01:36.720]  chair and relax a little bit.
[01:36.720 --> 01:39.080]  I got the Clementine keeping my head going.
[01:39.080 --> 01:41.200]  I got the Tahoe OG chilling my body out.
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.840]  It's got me in a great mood.
[01:42.840 --> 01:43.840]  I feel good.
[01:43.840 --> 01:45.320]  Let's do a podcast, you guys.
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.320]  I want to keep it quick.
[01:46.320 --> 01:47.880]  I call it a quickie.
[01:47.880 --> 01:49.320]  Let's try to stick to it.
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.080]  I'm going to start by reading some emails.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.120]  If you'd like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.760]  You know I would love to hear from you.
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.640]  The first email goes like this.
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.600]  I have a quick question about dab tools, and it is spurred on by your recent mention of
[02:02.600 --> 02:05.160]  the dangers of using a pen to take dabs.
[02:05.160 --> 02:07.640]  Now, let me preface that a little bit.
[02:07.640 --> 02:11.440]  I use a glass pencil as a dabber.
[02:11.440 --> 02:13.500]  This was given to me as a gift by the dabbing granny.
[02:13.500 --> 02:16.080]  This was made by a glass artist known as Tater Glass.
[02:16.080 --> 02:19.320]  He makes pencils and other glass apparatuses.
[02:19.320 --> 02:24.000]  I have this glass pencil dabber sitting on my table next to the computer, next to my
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.320]  pen, next to my pen stick, next to my notebook, next to my other pen, next to my beverage,
[02:27.320 --> 02:28.760]  next to a folder, next to my torch.
[02:28.760 --> 02:31.000]  There's a bunch of shit on this table is what I'm getting at.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.160]  It's a clusterfuck of dab things and recording stuff and podcast notes and hash containers
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.960]  and beverages.
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.960]  It's just a clusterfuck.
[02:37.960 --> 02:39.720]  So I've got this glass pencil here.
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.560]  I have picked up this glass pencil that is meant to be used as a dabber, and I have tried
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.880]  to write a note with it before.
[02:46.880 --> 02:49.280]  It didn't work because it's not a pencil, it's a dabber.
[02:49.280 --> 02:50.280]  That was funny.
[02:50.280 --> 02:52.920]  Then, on a recent episode, I think Kevin and Mike were here.
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.520]  It might've been episode 300.
[02:54.520 --> 03:02.560]  I picked up my pen, my Bic pen, my Paper Mate ballpoint pen, thinking that this was my glass
[03:02.560 --> 03:03.560]  dabber.
[03:03.560 --> 03:04.560]  I almost put a dab on this thing.
[03:04.560 --> 03:08.920]  I reached toward the concentrate and said, oh shit, that is a pen.
[03:08.920 --> 03:11.120]  That's what this talks, that's what this is referring to.
[03:11.120 --> 03:13.680]  That's what this spurred on from.
[03:13.680 --> 03:16.560]  So he says, I have a quick question about dab tools and it's spurred on by your recent
[03:16.560 --> 03:18.840]  mention of the dangers of using a pen to take dabs.
[03:18.840 --> 03:21.360]  It would've been dangerous if I had taken a dab with that pen, you guys, and I'm going
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.000]  to talk about that in a minute.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.680]  The question is, is it okay to use stainless steel dabbers?
[03:25.680 --> 03:30.320]  I know a lot of people use titanium or glass rods, but I don't know about stainless steel.
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.120]  I'm still kind of a rookie with my gear and I repurposed a piece of 316 stainless steel
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.800]  TIG welding rod to get my dabs in the banger.
[03:37.800 --> 03:41.680]  I assume many tools are made out of stainless and I certainly know better than to use my
[03:41.680 --> 03:43.120]  mild steel, for example.
[03:43.120 --> 03:45.240]  Do you have any insight on this?
[03:45.240 --> 03:46.640]  Thanks and take it easy.
[03:46.640 --> 03:47.640]  Signed, No Name.
[03:47.640 --> 03:48.640]  All right.
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.640]  I want to write a couple of notes because I'm off on a rant here and I want to not forget
[03:53.640 --> 03:54.640]  anything.
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.040]  So, um, it sounds like, you know, about metals, you are a welder.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.680]  Um, I'm going to sound, I'm going to be honest here.
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.240]  I don't know what 316 stainless steel honestly is.
[04:05.240 --> 04:09.240]  I wouldn't know the difference between 420, 215 and 316 stainless steel if you smacked
[04:09.240 --> 04:10.680]  me in the face with them.
[04:10.680 --> 04:12.080]  Couldn't identify that.
[04:12.080 --> 04:14.320]  Sounds like you know more about metals than I do.
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.280]  Um, you say you hear people using titanium and glass.
[04:18.280 --> 04:19.280]  Yes.
[04:19.280 --> 04:25.400]  The reason is the main reason is safety and the exact opposite reason why dabbing from
[04:25.400 --> 04:27.280]  this pen would have been dangerous.
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.480]  This pen would have melted into the banger and the plastic would have melted and caused
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.480]  all kinds of funky gases to go into my lungs and I would have, I may have died had I dabbed
[04:36.480 --> 04:37.480]  with the pen.
[04:37.480 --> 04:38.480]  I wouldn't have done it.
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.480]  You guys, I was paying more attention to that.
[04:39.480 --> 04:42.840]  I was exaggerating the, uh, the likelihood of me actually doing that.
[04:42.840 --> 04:45.800]  I wasn't going to do it, but I picked up the pen and was like, oh, that's not your
[04:45.800 --> 04:46.800]  dabber dumbass.
[04:46.800 --> 04:49.120]  And I just made a joke out of it, but I wasn't really going to do it.
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.120]  I exaggerated it.
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.800]  But if I had pressed this pen against a red hot dabber, a dab nail, at first I would have
[04:54.800 --> 04:57.360]  smoked some ink and then I would have smoked a little tip and then I would have smoked
[04:57.360 --> 05:01.440]  this clear plastic and then I would have smoked a lot of ink and then darker plastic and it
[05:01.440 --> 05:02.760]  would have happened pretty quickly because it was hot.
[05:02.760 --> 05:06.480]  I would have went and I would have inhaled and I would have gotten toxic smoke.
[05:06.480 --> 05:07.640]  The room would have smelled like crap.
[05:07.640 --> 05:08.880]  I'd ruin the banger.
[05:08.880 --> 05:10.800]  Probably just throw away that rig.
[05:10.800 --> 05:13.120]  I'd probably have to drive to the hospital and figure out how to get this shit out of
[05:13.120 --> 05:14.120]  my lungs.
[05:14.120 --> 05:15.120]  It would have been terrible.
[05:15.120 --> 05:17.160]  So the pen would have been the extreme side of it.
[05:17.160 --> 05:18.160]  I don't know what happened.
[05:18.160 --> 05:19.160]  I don't want to figure that out.
[05:19.160 --> 05:21.680]  I don't want to dab a pan plastic crap like that.
[05:21.680 --> 05:22.960]  I want clean quality concentrates.
[05:22.960 --> 05:25.120]  Pay a lot of money for that.
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.480]  Um, now you ask about titanium or glass rods.
[05:28.480 --> 05:32.160]  That's recommended because there's no off gas titanium.
[05:32.160 --> 05:34.280]  Quality titanium is titanium.
[05:34.280 --> 05:40.760]  If you get titanium from highly educated, he says, task rock says it is 99.9% pure titanium.
[05:41.720 --> 05:42.720]  And it's the high quality titanium.
[05:42.720 --> 05:43.720]  There are two different grades.
[05:43.720 --> 05:47.400]  There's grade one and grade two or grade A and grade B. It's the higher quality.
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.720]  He says the point one that he leaves out to say that it's titanium is because of atmospheric
[05:51.720 --> 05:56.640]  conditions like moisture and oxygen that he cannot control that are inside of that titanium.
[05:56.640 --> 06:00.920]  So the reason we use the glass and titanium is because there's no off gassing.
[06:00.920 --> 06:01.920]  Nothing's going to melt.
[06:01.920 --> 06:04.440]  We're not going to get any toxins in our bodies.
[06:04.440 --> 06:07.160]  When you heat up metals, you, my friend are a metal worker.
[06:07.160 --> 06:08.160]  It sounds like I know who you are.
[06:08.160 --> 06:09.160]  I know you weld.
[06:09.160 --> 06:10.160]  I know you work with metal.
[06:10.160 --> 06:11.160]  I know you work with hot metals.
[06:11.160 --> 06:15.080]  A lot of people listening may not be aware that when you heat up a metal, it creates
[06:15.080 --> 06:16.080]  gases.
[06:16.080 --> 06:19.040]  I think they are, um, oxides or oxidates.
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.040]  I didn't read up on this.
[06:20.040 --> 06:24.000]  I just, I know very little about this, but I know enough to give you some guidance here.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.040]  When you heat up certain metals, they create off gases and you don't want to inhale those
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.440]  gases.
[06:30.440 --> 06:36.760]  Titanium can do it also is what I read, but it has the least likelihood of off gassing
[06:36.760 --> 06:38.180]  of all of the metals.
[06:38.180 --> 06:45.580]  So use titanium if you can, but in a pinch you can use whatever, but I would recommend
[06:45.580 --> 06:47.460]  not to use some shitty metals.
[06:47.460 --> 06:49.340]  It sounds like, you know, about stainless steel.
[06:49.340 --> 06:53.700]  I would recommend stainless steel next in line from titanium, those dental tools, like
[06:53.700 --> 06:56.540]  the dental picks that you see, that's probably your next bet.
[06:56.540 --> 06:57.540]  Best bet.
[06:57.540 --> 07:01.880]  Safest bet to titanium, which are surgical steel, medical grade stainless steel.
[07:01.880 --> 07:06.520]  So stainless steel should be legit as long as it's not soft, shitty hot dog metal.
[07:06.520 --> 07:07.940]  So be careful with what you're dabbing with.
[07:08.700 --> 07:09.700]  I would recommend glass.
[07:09.700 --> 07:11.140]  I would recommend titanium.
[07:11.140 --> 07:13.220]  After that, I would recommend stainless steel.
[07:13.220 --> 07:15.820]  I wouldn't go with anything like a paper clip.
[07:15.820 --> 07:18.680]  If you're in a pinch, dude, do what you got to do to take a dab.
[07:18.680 --> 07:21.940]  If you were in a serious pinch, get a fork and bend that fucker and use the fork if you
[07:21.940 --> 07:22.940]  have to.
[07:22.940 --> 07:25.160]  Just don't do it a lot and go low temps.
[07:25.160 --> 07:29.300]  High temperatures and shitty metals is where things are going to happen and you can't see
[07:29.300 --> 07:30.300]  it.
[07:30.300 --> 07:31.500]  You can't smell it, but it's happening.
[07:31.500 --> 07:33.260]  That metal and the heat is changing.
[07:33.260 --> 07:35.980]  That's what, uh, that's what happens when metal gets hot.
[07:35.980 --> 07:38.860]  It starts to melt and when shit melts, it lets off a gas.
[07:38.860 --> 07:41.180]  Maybe you've got something that's got like a chrome plating or something on it.
[07:41.180 --> 07:42.500]  You're going to smoke that chrome plating.
[07:42.500 --> 07:44.940]  You don't want any of that shit in your lungs.
[07:44.940 --> 07:45.940]  Be careful.
[07:45.940 --> 07:46.940]  Very good question.
[07:46.940 --> 07:50.660]  I'm still kind of a rookie with your gear and you've repurposed a piece and don't be
[07:50.660 --> 07:51.660]  shy that you're a rookie.
[07:51.660 --> 07:53.020]  I'm proud of you for asking questions.
[07:53.020 --> 07:54.020]  That's awesome.
[07:54.020 --> 07:56.460]  Uh, he says, I know better than to use mild steel.
[07:56.460 --> 07:58.140]  It sounds like you know what you're doing with metals.
[07:58.140 --> 08:02.140]  I would probably trust your judgment to the other listeners.
[08:02.140 --> 08:03.380]  Don't use any cheap, shitty metal.
[08:03.380 --> 08:07.100]  You guys don't use a screwdriver cause it's probably got some oil or some grease on it.
[08:07.100 --> 08:11.940]  Try to get yourself a decent dabber, a dental tool, a dab tool, something like that.
[08:11.940 --> 08:14.580]  Stainless steel, titanium glass is always easy.
[08:14.580 --> 08:16.140]  You guys glasses abundant.
[08:16.140 --> 08:17.420]  You can find these pencil styled.
[08:17.420 --> 08:22.020]  I recommend that you buy glass from a local glass artist that is going to pay his bills,
[08:22.020 --> 08:26.260]  pays electricity, buy more oxygen, buy more gas for his torch, upgrade his torch, keep
[08:26.260 --> 08:29.900]  his tools in line, buy more glass, support your local glass artist.
[08:29.900 --> 08:35.500]  If you can buy a dabber from them, a glass dabber, if not, most of the head shops now
[08:35.500 --> 08:39.340]  are carrying pencil dabbers for very affordable prices.
[08:39.340 --> 08:41.860]  So go pick up yourself a glass dabber.
[08:41.860 --> 08:44.200]  You can find something cheap at your local head shop.
[08:44.200 --> 08:47.460]  It's safer than using some crappy metal that you found laying around.
[08:47.460 --> 08:52.740]  Uh, to my friend, uh, who sent this trust your judgment, dude, you know more about metal
[08:52.740 --> 08:55.140]  than I do do what you're going to do.
[08:55.140 --> 08:56.140]  Great email.
[08:56.140 --> 08:57.460]  I appreciate that.
[08:57.460 --> 08:58.860]  Something else I want to mention.
[08:58.860 --> 09:03.940]  Um, I see a lot of people capping their banger.
[09:03.940 --> 09:05.900]  And if you're, if you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about.
[09:05.900 --> 09:07.940]  If this doesn't make any sense, I'll kind of explain it.
[09:07.940 --> 09:12.460]  When you take a dab, you heat up the banger and then the banger is the part that the dab
[09:12.460 --> 09:13.460]  goes in.
[09:13.460 --> 09:14.460]  I know so many tools, right?
[09:14.460 --> 09:18.220]  The rig is the actual small pipe bubbler slash mini bong.
[09:18.220 --> 09:22.260]  I like a small one, the small pipe that the smoke is going to go through.
[09:22.260 --> 09:23.760]  That is your rig.
[09:23.760 --> 09:26.820]  The nail part that I'm using currently is a banger.
[09:26.820 --> 09:27.820]  It's glass.
[09:27.820 --> 09:33.220]  Um, it is a glass elbow with basically a glass thimble on it is what it looks like.
[09:33.220 --> 09:34.620]  And I'm using a thermal banger.
[09:34.620 --> 09:36.820]  So there's more to it than that, but we're going to keep it simple.
[09:36.820 --> 09:40.700]  It looks like a glass thimble and you heat it up and you put your hash in there and it
[09:40.700 --> 09:41.780]  smokes.
[09:41.780 --> 09:44.820]  But if you cap it, you create kind of a vacuum inside of there.
[09:44.820 --> 09:49.220]  And when you inhale that heat is trapped in there and it stokes your dab heat and you
[09:49.220 --> 09:51.020]  get more of the dab at a lower temperature.
[09:51.020 --> 09:53.700]  You don't have to heat it and sizzle off all the flavor and burn your lungs.
[09:53.700 --> 09:57.500]  You can get it low temp and still cook all the hash, all the concentrate and get a nice
[09:57.500 --> 09:58.580]  fat dab.
[09:58.580 --> 10:00.820]  So we use a carb cap.
[10:00.820 --> 10:05.300]  A lot of times there's not a carb cap around or people lost it or they're lazy or it's
[10:05.300 --> 10:07.860]  fucking just out of reach and your stoner friend can't hear you going, bro, give me
[10:07.860 --> 10:11.220]  the carb cap, carb cap, cap, cap, cap while you're trying to take your dab.
[10:11.220 --> 10:13.980]  So people will just pick up some random shit and cap it.
[10:13.980 --> 10:16.500]  I see a lot of people use the bottom of their hash jar.
[10:16.500 --> 10:21.540]  I see a lot of people use, uh, those silicone concentrate containers.
[10:21.540 --> 10:24.580]  I see people use random shit to cap their dabs.
[10:24.580 --> 10:25.580]  You guys be careful.
[10:25.660 --> 10:28.220]  Uh, some of that shit's going to melt one day.
[10:28.220 --> 10:31.620]  Whatever's on the bottom of your cap, you're dabbing that also.
[10:31.620 --> 10:34.580]  And we're paying a lot of money for these concentrates and we're calling it medical
[10:34.580 --> 10:35.660]  marijuana.
[10:35.660 --> 10:38.380]  Whatever you're dabbing that's on the bottom of these jars, whatever you're dabbing on
[10:38.380 --> 10:41.340]  that silicone container, that's not probably good for you.
[10:41.340 --> 10:43.820]  So just be careful, be aware, do what you want to do.
[10:43.820 --> 10:47.220]  You're an adult, but just think about what you may be melting.
[10:47.220 --> 10:48.660]  Think about what you may be smoking.
[10:48.660 --> 10:51.820]  We're really trying to improve our health, improve the quality of our lives.
[10:51.820 --> 10:53.320]  So pay attention.
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.320]  Think about it.
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.120]  Uh, don't just be wanting to get high so badly that you're willing to fuck up your health.
[10:59.120 --> 11:03.480]  I'm getting at the age to where I'm noticing all of those mistakes that I did when I was
[11:03.480 --> 11:04.560]  20.
[11:04.560 --> 11:05.560]  They are hitting me now.
[11:05.560 --> 11:08.960]  I'm like, Oh, that's from that night that I drank seven bottles of whiskey.
[11:08.960 --> 11:12.360]  Probably is why this little spot right here in my stomach hurts and I have no explanation
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.760]  why shit like that starts adding up when you get older.
[11:15.760 --> 11:18.220]  So don't break yourself while you're young.
[11:18.220 --> 11:20.000]  If you're getting old, you know what I'm talking about.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.720]  You're probably getting wise anyway.
[11:21.720 --> 11:23.720]  Pay attention to what you're doing.
[11:23.720 --> 11:28.440]  Treat it like a medicine, not like something you're Jonesing for and respect your body.
[11:28.440 --> 11:30.160]  And I think that'll get you through life pretty well.
[11:30.160 --> 11:31.160]  All right.
[11:31.160 --> 11:32.640]  So, uh, Hey dude, thank you for the great email.
[11:32.640 --> 11:34.240]  I would love to hear more emails from you.
[11:34.240 --> 11:35.240]  I'd love to hang out with you.
[11:35.240 --> 11:36.240]  I know who you are.
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.880]  Let's get together, bro.
[11:37.880 --> 11:39.040]  We had fun last time.
[11:39.040 --> 11:40.040]  All right.
[11:40.040 --> 11:41.040]  I've got another email.
[11:41.040 --> 11:42.040]  I'm going to try to keep this quick.
[11:42.040 --> 11:43.040]  I've got one more email.
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.920]  Uh, I don't know if he wants me to say his name.
[11:45.920 --> 11:46.920]  I'm just going to get right to it.
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.940]  He says, Hey Jeff, the famine, I went for a drive on Saturday to scout some possible
[11:50.940 --> 11:52.840]  camping spots for the summer.
[11:52.960 --> 11:57.400]  We were up North, up past Fort Collins and he, this is a fellow Colorado in here.
[11:57.400 --> 12:00.080]  We came across an area where people had been dumping.
[12:00.080 --> 12:03.800]  I got out to check out, check it out because the piles looked oddly familiar.
[12:03.800 --> 12:04.800]  Yup.
[12:04.800 --> 12:06.960]  A whole bunch of cannabis root balls.
[12:06.960 --> 12:11.000]  It was a sad sight to see all these root balls littered all over our mountain space.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.160]  I have attached a few photos I took so you can see it.
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.560]  And I looked, you guys, it's like a, I can't, by the distance, I can't tell the size of
[12:18.560 --> 12:19.560]  the pot.
[12:19.560 --> 12:20.680]  It's either three, five or seven gallon pots.
[12:20.680 --> 12:24.040]  And there are a lot of them just scattered about the national forest, just like in this
[12:24.040 --> 12:28.840]  little area where you're lazy enough just to pull off the road and get out of your truck
[12:28.840 --> 12:31.080]  and just dump all these pots and then get back in.
[12:31.080 --> 12:33.200]  That's how far off the road they went.
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.400]  And there were a lot of them and it was hideous and it was embarrassing, but I'm going to
[12:36.400 --> 12:38.520]  continue with the email.
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.380]  He says, granted it's all plant material that will break down, but we need to treat our
[12:42.380 --> 12:44.040]  environment like the proper farmers.
[12:44.040 --> 12:45.280]  We should strive to be.
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.160]  However, the people that did this are not responsible growers, but we get to bear the
[12:49.160 --> 12:52.560]  negative stereotype that is perpetuated by this behavior.
[12:52.560 --> 12:56.280]  So if you could speak to this, however, this hits you, I would appreciate it.
[12:56.280 --> 12:57.920]  Much love Rasta.
[12:57.920 --> 12:59.680]  Bro, we agree on this.
[12:59.680 --> 13:02.520]  We think that this is total bullshit.
[13:02.520 --> 13:06.660]  I don't call myself a cannabis advocate or an activist or whatever, although other people
[13:06.660 --> 13:11.120]  have labeled me that I feel, I don't know, just felt weird to say it just now.
[13:11.120 --> 13:15.760]  But as some, as a spokesperson and a whatever, a spokesperson, I can't think of the other
[13:15.760 --> 13:17.520]  word, a spokesperson for cannabis.
[13:17.520 --> 13:20.880]  There's another word that I want to use that I can't find right now in my head.
[13:20.880 --> 13:23.760]  That'll come to me at like four in the morning and I'll wake up and start recording again.
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.360]  But as a spokesperson and ambassador, as an ambassador for cannabis, as somebody that
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.560]  represents the plant and wants to teach everybody to do it right, that shit's embarrassing.
[13:32.560 --> 13:34.120]  And that's a setback.
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.880]  Unfortunately, the people that do that type of shit are not listening to this podcast.
[13:38.880 --> 13:42.880]  I'd like to think I'm sure somebody that listens to this podcast is doing some dipshit fuckery
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.080]  right now, but I'd like to believe that my audience and my friends are not the people
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.600]  dumping their root balls in our national forest, up in the land where my friend wanted
[13:51.600 --> 13:53.760]  to take his family to go camping.
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.080]  The amount of pots and the amount of space that took was about the same size that your
[13:57.080 --> 13:58.920]  car and your tent would take to camp.
[13:58.920 --> 14:00.560]  That's how much land they are wasting.
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.200]  So yeah, they are root balls, but you guys be responsible.
[14:05.200 --> 14:10.160]  And I'm not, this probably wasn't any of you that are listening, but let's encourage your
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.120]  friends or if you know somebody that does this type of shit, let's remind them that
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.520]  we have been given a, it's a right now because it is in our constitution, but people had
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.520]  to work hard for this.
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.720]  We've been given the right to grow this plant.
[14:22.720 --> 14:25.400]  We have been given this plant to treat ourselves.
[14:25.400 --> 14:29.080]  We have to be respectful to this plant.
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.320]  Not only to this plant, we have to be respectful to this planet.
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.600]  Everything we rely on to grow this plant comes from this planet.
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.840]  So if you destroy this planet, we cannot grow this plant.
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.520]  Also, it's not all yours.
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.240]  Part of that land that you threw that fucking cocoa or that soil on was part of mine and
[14:50.240 --> 14:51.880]  I don't fucking want it there.
[14:51.880 --> 14:54.680]  My daughter needs that forest for something in the future.
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.240]  I don't want my daughter to live that fucking bumper sticker that says, daddy, daddy, what
[14:59.240 --> 15:01.240]  we're forest like.
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.500]  I don't want that.
[15:02.500 --> 15:07.200]  So let's teach each other to respect the earth more.
[15:07.200 --> 15:08.520]  You may be doing your part.
[15:08.520 --> 15:09.520]  Teach somebody else.
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.880]  Politely say, man, pick that shit up.
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.880]  If I see somebody, I'm six foot five and I weigh 200 pounds.
[15:15.880 --> 15:19.480]  Maybe I, maybe it's easier for me when I see somebody litter or throw a cigarette butt
[15:19.480 --> 15:20.480]  on the floor.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.480]  It's on to pick that shit up, man.
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.920]  And I say it just like that, just because they know better and it clicks in their head.
[15:25.920 --> 15:26.920]  They go, you're right.
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.200]  I'm a shit bag and they pick up their cigarette butt and hopefully that rings with them.
[15:31.200 --> 15:34.400]  Hopefully they go, man, that tall white guy with dreadlocks that looked fucking homeless
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.400]  was right.
[15:35.400 --> 15:38.360]  I should not be flicking my cigarette butts on the floor like a bag of shit.
[15:39.200 --> 15:41.840]  So just say, say, Hey man, I wouldn't throw that shit out there.
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.840]  Just encourage each other.
[15:42.840 --> 15:43.840]  I think it's wrong.
[15:43.840 --> 15:45.040]  He asked me, would you please speak on this?
[15:45.040 --> 15:46.520]  Yes, I'll rant on this all fucking night.
[15:46.520 --> 15:47.520]  It's terrible.
[15:47.520 --> 15:48.520]  It's hideous.
[15:48.520 --> 15:49.520]  It's embarrassing.
[15:49.520 --> 15:52.840]  Uh, unfortunately I'm not speaking to the right people because I'm sure that my audience
[15:52.840 --> 15:54.400]  is not throwing their root balls out there.
[15:54.400 --> 15:56.280]  And if you are quit doing it, dude, that's bad.
[15:56.280 --> 15:57.480]  That's wrong.
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.240]  So we've got, we've been given this gift, this right, this blessing to grow cannabis
[16:01.240 --> 16:05.240]  without going to jail, without getting raided, without getting our dog shot and our livelihood
[16:05.240 --> 16:08.960]  taken from us and being separated from our families for producing a plant that heals
[16:08.960 --> 16:09.960]  us.
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.280]  Then you want to drive out to the national forest or a camping area where my buddy wanted
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.640]  to go camp with his family and throw your fucking waste out in the fucking dirt out
[16:18.640 --> 16:19.640]  in the national forest.
[16:19.640 --> 16:21.320]  No, that's shit baggery.
[16:21.320 --> 16:22.560]  Don't do that.
[16:22.560 --> 16:26.800]  Pay the money to take it to the dump, pay the money to take it to a farm and let a farmer
[16:26.800 --> 16:27.800]  recycle it.
[16:27.800 --> 16:29.200]  He might want to stir that shit into his lot.
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.760]  He might need that for something or quit being a bag of shit and learn to recycle it somehow.
[16:34.760 --> 16:35.760]  Start it out.
[16:35.760 --> 16:36.760]  Don't waste that much shit.
[16:36.760 --> 16:38.720]  Don't throw it in our land.
[16:38.720 --> 16:39.720]  This land is your land.
[16:39.720 --> 16:40.800]  This line is my land.
[16:40.800 --> 16:41.880]  It's both of our shit.
[16:41.880 --> 16:43.600]  Quit fucking it up for me.
[16:43.600 --> 16:47.640]  Quit putting X marks on the cannabis fucking world.
[16:47.640 --> 16:50.120]  We want wins, not losses and shit like this is a loss.
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.120]  This is a negative.
[16:51.120 --> 16:52.120]  We want positives.
[16:52.120 --> 16:53.120]  We need more pluses.
[16:53.120 --> 16:54.240]  This is not growing from your heart.
[16:54.240 --> 16:55.440]  This is growing from your wallet.
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.680]  This is being an asshole.
[16:56.680 --> 16:58.320]  So thank you for the great email.
[16:58.320 --> 16:59.320]  You got me off on a good rant.
[16:59.320 --> 17:00.320]  I do appreciate it.
[17:00.320 --> 17:01.640]  I think it's wrong.
[17:01.640 --> 17:08.400]  Um, did you do anything about it or did if you, you did, because you sent me this email
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.200]  and you taught the kids not to do this bullshit, but it might be a cool field trip to take
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.200]  the kids out there and help have some other friends come with you and help clean it up.
[17:16.200 --> 17:19.000]  It's in Fort Collins, like four hours away from me.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.080]  Uh, let's plan some cleanup kind of shit like that because that's terrible.
[17:23.080 --> 17:25.920]  All right, you guys, I went off on a good rant right there.
[17:25.920 --> 17:26.920]  Thank you for the great email.
[17:26.920 --> 17:28.640]  I hope you guys found some good spots to go camping.
[17:28.640 --> 17:30.120]  I hope you have a great camping summer.
[17:30.120 --> 17:31.120]  Be safe.
[17:31.600 --> 17:34.600]  Remember that it is illegal to take your cannabis into a national forest.
[17:34.600 --> 17:38.000]  Um, yeah, that's all I got to say.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, that was a great short podcast.
[17:41.640 --> 17:42.720]  I had fun doing that one.

[17:44.280 --> 17:45.280]  Thanks for hanging out.
[17:45.280 --> 17:47.880]  I do need to give a huge shout out to my friends at PL Grow Systems.

[18:44.240 --> 18:46.520]  Find me on Instagram, it's iri underscore genetics.
[18:46.520 --> 18:48.840]  Find me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[18:48.840 --> 18:50.520]  Of course you can send me an email.
[18:50.520 --> 18:52.760]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[18:52.760 --> 18:57.800]  On YouTube I have got 203 videos I think up to YouTube now.
[18:57.800 --> 18:59.400]  I'll get more up really soon.
[18:59.400 --> 19:01.240]  I figured out a way to make it go faster.
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.960]  I also have purchased a new machine.
[19:02.960 --> 19:04.320]  It's not here yet.
[19:04.320 --> 19:08.200]  It better get here tomorrow or I'm going to act a fool in Best Buy.
[19:08.200 --> 19:10.240]  I'll let you guys know how that goes.
[19:10.240 --> 19:13.000]  If it comes or if I act a fool.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.760]  You'll find out, trust me.
[19:14.760 --> 19:16.600]  Also videos, check out the videos.
[19:16.600 --> 19:18.000]  Grow From Your Heart podcast on YouTube.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  Also don't forget about Patreon.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.840]  I remind you about Patreon every episode.
[19:20.840 --> 19:21.840]  I'll be quick.
[19:21.840 --> 19:27.880]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart is a way that you can contribute to the podcast.
[19:27.880 --> 19:31.520]  I had to purchase a new MacBook Pro because mine was taking a poop and that's how I produced
[19:31.520 --> 19:32.760]  the show.
[19:32.760 --> 19:34.800]  It was a little pricey.
[19:34.800 --> 19:39.240]  If you'd like to help offset the cost of that, patreon.com slash growfromyourheart is the
[19:39.240 --> 19:40.760]  way to do so.
[19:40.760 --> 19:44.280]  I'm not begging, but I sure would appreciate the help.
[19:44.280 --> 19:46.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks again for listening.
[19:46.340 --> 19:47.340]  Thanks for hanging out.
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.760]  I'll be back Monday with a full length episode.
[19:48.760 --> 19:51.920]  This one kind of turned into a full length episode anyway, but thanks for hanging out.
[19:51.920 --> 19:53.000]  We'll call it a quickie anyway.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.560]  I'm going to dip out before we get in trouble.
[19:54.560 --> 19:57.080]  I want to give a huge shout out to everyone.
[19:57.080 --> 20:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, recently an online magazine posted an article about the top 10
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.120]  best podcasts, cannabis based podcasts.
[20:05.120 --> 20:07.880]  A lot of people, I didn't get mentioned in there.
[20:07.880 --> 20:10.440]  A lot of people seemed riled up about that and they all commented.
[20:10.440 --> 20:11.440]  They said, fuck that.
[20:11.440 --> 20:14.640]  Rasta Jeff of iRegenetics at the Grow From Your Heart podcast should be on this list.
[20:14.640 --> 20:16.800]  You guys are crazy for not listing him.
[20:16.800 --> 20:17.940]  A lot of people sent me the link.
[20:17.940 --> 20:18.940]  A lot of people commented.
[20:18.940 --> 20:19.940]  Dude, thank you.
[20:19.940 --> 20:22.920]  A shout out to everybody who tagged me in that post.
[20:22.920 --> 20:26.440]  I'm not trying to fight to be on something, but for all the love and support, that meant
[20:26.440 --> 20:27.440]  a lot to me.
[20:27.440 --> 20:30.600]  Just for the audience that read that article to be like, dude, you did not do your research
[20:30.600 --> 20:32.240]  because you missed Rasta Jeff.
[20:32.240 --> 20:33.240]  That meant a lot to me.
[20:33.240 --> 20:37.120]  So shout out to everybody who tagged me, who supported me, who mentioned me in that article.
[20:37.120 --> 20:38.200]  I love you guys.
[20:38.200 --> 20:39.200]  That is super cool.
[20:39.200 --> 20:40.200]  It makes me feel good inside.
[20:40.200 --> 20:42.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[20:42.240 --> 20:43.400]  I'll catch you again Monday.
[20:43.400 --> 20:46.320]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
