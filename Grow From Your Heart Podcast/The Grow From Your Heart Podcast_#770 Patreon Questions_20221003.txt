[00:01.080 --> 00:22.440]  Alright, here we go. Welcome to the show podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta
[00:22.440 --> 00:29.120]  Jeff. This is episode 770 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. In this episode, I'm going
[00:29.120 --> 00:33.400]  to focus on a couple of Patreon questions. Before I get to that part of the show, let's
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.840]  do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show on
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.640]  Patreon. Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.840]  to one of my favorite photographers, my friend Levity Loveday. Let's send a fist bump and
[00:46.840 --> 00:51.100]  a thank you shout out to Crafted Flower and Quazi. Let's send a big fist bump to the hardest
[00:51.100 --> 00:55.120]  working man in cannabis, my friend James Brown. Let's send a big thank you shout out to Froggle

[01:13.120 --> 01:19.300]  shout out to Operation High Vibes. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues
[01:19.300 --> 01:23.580]  to support the show on Patreon. If you are not already supporting the show and you would
[01:23.580 --> 01:30.460]  like to learn how to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash
[01:30.460 --> 01:34.580]  grow from your heart. All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:34.580 --> 01:38.580]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:38.580 --> 01:44.340]  it super easy for all of my friends to support the podcast. If you are watching on the YouTube
[01:44.340 --> 01:48.660]  video, which I do highly encourage, you may have noticed I'm rocking one of the brand
[01:48.660 --> 01:53.500]  new IRIE Genetics logo t-shirts. That's right. I put the cross logo, the red, golden, green
[01:53.500 --> 01:58.360]  cross logo on a black t-shirt. In my opinion, it looks super sharp. I think these colors
[01:58.360 --> 02:03.100]  pop quite well on the black t-shirt. You can get yours on my website. There is a link in
[02:03.100 --> 02:07.420]  the show notes and in the video description. Or simply search IRIE Genetics. Go to the
[02:07.420 --> 02:11.940]  IRIE Genetics website. Click on the merch tab. That will get you to the merch store.
[02:11.940 --> 02:17.780]  You can get your fresh new IRIE Genetics t-shirts. Also, I will be taking pre-orders for hoodies
[02:17.780 --> 02:22.100]  with the same logo very soon. Probably by the time this episode comes out, there will
[02:22.100 --> 02:27.180]  be pre-orders available on the same website to get your hoodies for the winter.
[02:27.180 --> 02:32.140]  Alright, let's not waste too much time. Let's jump into the main topic of today's podcast.
[02:32.140 --> 02:37.060]  At the top of the show, I did say that I was going to focus on Patreon questions. Recently,
[02:37.060 --> 02:42.940]  I posted to Patreon that I was going to eat too many edibles and do a Patreon only episode
[02:42.940 --> 02:48.340]  where I answered non-Grow questions, maybe Grow questions about myself, about my personal
[02:48.340 --> 02:52.420]  life, maybe the music I'm into, maybe some of my past or my history. I opened it up so
[02:52.420 --> 02:57.260]  that the patrons can ask any questions they felt comfortable asking. Something I don't
[02:57.260 --> 03:01.580]  want to do is do a Patreon episode where I answer a bunch of great Grow questions and
[03:01.580 --> 03:06.460]  leave people out. I want that knowledge free and available to everybody. So, when I do
[03:06.460 --> 03:12.820]  Patreon bonus content, it is going to be non-Grow related content, kind of fun content, kind
[03:12.820 --> 03:17.020]  of ways to just hang out with the crowd and give them extra content that doesn't exclude
[03:17.020 --> 03:21.300]  growers. I think you get my point. So, I did ask for questions that were not Grow related
[03:21.300 --> 03:25.580]  and I did say I was going to eat a bunch of edibles. Allegedly, possibly, I may have eaten
[03:25.580 --> 03:30.060]  those edibles before this podcast. We're going to do this normal show, see how long it takes
[03:30.060 --> 03:34.100]  those to kick in, then we will take a break, then of course we will shift to the Patreon
[03:34.100 --> 03:38.260]  only format. So, let's jump into this first question here while things start doing their
[03:38.260 --> 03:43.940]  magic. This one goes a little bit, maybe a lot, like this. It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, and
[03:43.940 --> 03:49.240]  it comes from my friend Gruesome Green on Patreon, big up to Gruesome Green on Patreon.
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.060]  It says, Rasta Jeff, would you ever consider being a sponsor for a band? And that is a
[03:54.060 --> 04:00.620]  really good question. Also, really good ironic timing. Saturday night, I'm recording on,
[04:00.620 --> 04:04.780]  what's the date right now? Do we have to be specific? I'm recording on September 28th.
[04:04.780 --> 04:09.700]  Saturday night, I got to go see the lovely Natalie Rise perform at a club here in my
[04:09.700 --> 04:13.980]  hometown. She played at Bruise Alehouse in Pueblo, Colorado. I got to take the lovely
[04:13.980 --> 04:18.340]  Miss Irie with me, you also know her as Dread Vibes, you also know her as Zara. That is
[04:18.340 --> 04:23.060]  Miss Irie, I took her with me. We got to go see Natalie Rise. Minori opened the show,
[04:23.060 --> 04:28.700]  it was a wonderful, an amazing concert. Natalie Rise did a great job, Minori did a great job.
[04:28.700 --> 04:33.180]  I love the rhythm section in Natalie Rise's band. But my point is, what you asked about
[04:33.180 --> 04:39.660]  is sponsor the band. Ironically, we worked out a sponsorship deal with that band. So
[04:39.660 --> 04:44.620]  the next leg of the Natalie Rise tour will be brought to you by Irie Genetics. I can't
[04:44.620 --> 04:48.380]  talk too much about what that does include, but I am sponsoring that band and they are
[04:48.380 --> 04:54.980]  not the first reggae band which I have sponsored. I have contributed funding to tours and recording,
[04:54.980 --> 04:59.500]  mixing and mastering for other reggae bands. I'm not sure if they want me to say who they
[04:59.500 --> 05:05.740]  are or not. I can say that I've done some work with Jamiri Morgan and I can maybe hint
[05:05.740 --> 05:12.060]  and lead on that there may be a strain being put together for Jamiri Morgan with his flavor
[05:12.060 --> 05:16.680]  profile and some things that he selected. Maybe doing some stuff for our friend Jamiri
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.920]  which may be released here in the near future. Also allegedly maybe working on something
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.440]  with Miss Natalie Rise. So the question is, would I consider being a sponsor for a band?
[05:26.440 --> 05:31.520]  Yes, I love sponsoring bands. When I was younger, and we're going to talk about this more in
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.600]  these episodes, these personal Rasta Jeff episodes. When I was younger, my original
[05:35.600 --> 05:40.120]  dream was to be a rock star. I'm a drummer. I got drums for my 14th birthday. I've been
[05:40.120 --> 05:44.200]  playing nonstop since then. I never give it a rest. I never quit thinking about polyrhythms
[05:44.200 --> 05:49.680]  and paradiddles and 16th note triplets and 12-8 time. Just weird shit. I'm always thinking
[05:49.680 --> 05:54.680]  about the drums. When I was younger, my dream was to travel and be a musician. I got to
[05:54.680 --> 06:00.680]  do it on a small level. I wasn't successful. I had fun. If success is traveling around
[06:00.680 --> 06:03.880]  and having fun with your friends and just partying real hard, we did that. I didn't
[06:03.880 --> 06:08.080]  really go anywhere with the opportunity that I had because I was young and I kind of squandered
[06:08.080 --> 06:13.040]  that. My dream was to play music. If I would have had somebody like myself to say, hey,
[06:13.040 --> 06:17.320]  here's funding. Here's gas money for the next part of the tour. Here's money for drumheads,
[06:17.320 --> 06:21.440]  guitar strings, and most importantly, food because a lot of times on the road, we were
[06:21.440 --> 06:26.160]  hungry, bro. Bands would promise you money, gas money, gig money, hotel room, and you
[06:26.160 --> 06:30.080]  would get there and you'd have to sleep in the van and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[06:30.080 --> 06:34.120]  It was worth it. I wouldn't change any of it, but man, that did suck. If I would have
[06:34.120 --> 06:39.120]  had somebody back in the day to fund my tour, I may have been more successful in the music
[06:39.120 --> 06:43.080]  industry. That's why I do it. I love the music that the artists that I promote and
[06:43.080 --> 06:47.280]  endorse and support and sponsor. I love their music. I love their vibe. I love what they're
[06:47.280 --> 06:51.200]  about. It feels good doing that. I get to go see my favorite reggae bands because I
[06:51.200 --> 06:55.640]  helped contribute to their funding. Then a lot of other people get to see them as well.
[06:55.640 --> 06:57.840]  Get treated like a rock star when you go. It's a good time.
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.200]  That's the first part of that question. I am rambling. Maybe the chocolates are kicking
[07:02.200 --> 07:06.840]  in. Then there's a part B of this question. It says, favorite place to visit or vacation
[07:06.840 --> 07:13.600]  in Colorado. We have four seasons here in Colorado. We get spring, summer, fall, and
[07:13.600 --> 07:18.960]  winter. Very noticeably different climates, environments here. Plus we got a lot of different
[07:18.960 --> 07:23.480]  types of environment here. We've got the desert. We've got the foresty stuff. We got mountainy
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.400]  stuff. Of course, we got ski season. We got lake season and shit like that. There's a
[07:27.400 --> 07:32.320]  lot of different things to do and places to go here in Colorado. Picking a favorite place
[07:32.320 --> 07:36.840]  to visit and vacation would be very, very hard to do just one. If you're going to come
[07:36.840 --> 07:40.920]  to my neck of the woods, Southern Colorado, and want me to show you around, I'm taking
[07:40.920 --> 07:45.560]  you to Bishop Castle. I'm taking you to Lake Isabella. I'm showing you outside stuff and
[07:45.560 --> 07:50.240]  real majestic outdoor shit. If we're in Denver and it's nice out, we're going to go toward
[07:50.240 --> 07:55.520]  the downtown area, especially if it's getting toward Christmas and it's not snowing. Downtown
[07:55.520 --> 08:00.560]  Denver is fucking beautiful. It looks great. If it's ski season time, we may go up to a
[08:00.600 --> 08:04.000]  little ski town, whichever we're closest to. They're all really adorable. There's a lot of
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.080]  great ski towns. It just depends on what the vibe is, what you're looking for. We've got so
[08:09.080 --> 08:13.920]  much great shit here to offer. It's so seasonal that you have to take advantage of the season
[08:13.920 --> 08:17.720]  and do what's available at this time of year. It depends on when you're coming, where you're
[08:17.720 --> 08:21.440]  trying to go, and what the vibe is. Are you taking a lady out? Are you showing the bros
[08:21.440 --> 08:24.960]  a night out on the town? You're trying to escape on your own. That really makes a huge
[08:24.960 --> 08:29.600]  difference here. I'm going to say Bishop Castle is a great place to take people. Meow Wolf,
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.280]  of course, is an amazing place to take people. I love Comedy Works. I'm a huge comedy nerd.
[08:34.640 --> 08:38.480]  If you're into music, you got to go see a concert at Red Rocks. That's all the cliche shit.
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.120]  Then once we do all that, then we'll go sneak off to all the fun stuff that nobody knows about
[08:42.160 --> 08:45.920]  that only the Colorado folks know about. I will take you there when you get here, but I'm not
[08:45.920 --> 08:49.600]  going to tell everybody about it on a podcast because I don't want to blow up all the spots
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.080]  and overcrowd it and make it not as cool anymore. We're going to say Meow Wolf, Red Rocks,
[08:55.080 --> 09:01.240]  Bishop Castle, Comedy Works, and then all the good restaurants. I love to just go eat good
[09:01.240 --> 09:07.680]  food in Denver, go walk around in Boulder. That whole area is beautiful. So yeah, Wyands is
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.920]  beautiful. Manitou Springs is beautiful. A lot of great shit. I am rambling. There's a lot more to
[09:12.920 --> 09:17.840]  get to. I couldn't pick one favorite place to visit in Colorado. That's really hard. This place
[09:17.880 --> 09:21.880]  is gorgeous. All right, we're going to keep moving because I can get quite rambly. I already
[09:21.880 --> 09:29.280]  feel the chocolate kicking in. This next message came from our friend Soil 2 Bowls, and it says,
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.520]  I would like to know more about your music past. What led you to the drums? Did playing drums and
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.440]  music, playing drums and music professionally change how playing music made you feel? They
[09:39.440 --> 09:44.360]  wrapped the message up with gave my mom a hug for you. She said you seem nice. Big shout out to
[09:44.360 --> 09:49.080]  mom. Thanks. Thank you for hugging her for me. Let me slow down and catch my breath. We will talk
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.640]  about this question. You want to know more about my musical past? What led me to the drums? I'm not
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.840]  sure exactly what led me to the drums. There's something when I would listen when I grew up when
[09:58.840 --> 10:03.000]  I was younger. I have some uncles I often talk about rest in peace, bros. I love you. And my one
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.360]  uncle Troy is still alive. Two of my uncles are gone. They kind of were my male role models, male
[10:08.360 --> 10:14.000]  influences. They listened to a lot of rock music, a lot of classic rock, a lot of metal. Metallica
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.520]  was played quite often or amongst those three. Metallica was probably the main commonality in
[10:18.520 --> 10:23.120]  those three uncles. Their favorites would have been Metallica together collectively. Just hearing
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.400]  that music, I was always just bobbing my head, banging my head to the drums. And then when I'd go
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.640]  to concerts, I just catch myself staring at the drummer. And then I fell in love with the band
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.920]  of Metallica. I mentioned Metallica. Yes, when I was younger, I was a huge Metallica fan. So maybe
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.120]  my uncle's live music and just feeling the drums and noticing that everybody just without the
[10:43.120 --> 10:46.840]  drums, you can't bob your head right. Like you could think you can, but there needs to be some
[10:46.840 --> 10:51.520]  drums to bob your head or dance properly. So that's part of why I fell in the drums. I fell in
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.400]  love with the drums is probably Metallica. I remember my uncle had a Chevy El Camino. If you
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.560]  know what that is big up if you don't you're better off. My uncle had a Chevy El Camino and he
[11:00.560 --> 11:04.800]  took me to a concert. And my two uncles smoked a joint in the front of that El Camino and they
[11:04.800 --> 11:10.240]  played the black album by Metallica. That smoke wafted into the back and I caught a nice buzz. And
[11:10.240 --> 11:14.400]  I heard the black album on the way to that concert. By the time I got to the concert, I was
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.960]  convinced I was going to be a fucking drummer that was so that's a big part of it right there. Did
[11:19.960 --> 11:25.560]  playing drums musical and music professionally change how playing music made you feel? Yes. Um,
[11:25.960 --> 11:30.760]  there's something about knowing the dirty, filthy side of the music industry that makes you just
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.480]  kind of not want to jump into it. It's like jumping into the pool, but then finding out there's
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.080]  fucking alligators in there. Like I want out of this shit. It was cool till I knew those all filled
[11:39.080 --> 11:46.560]  with fucking alligators and sharks. It's a lot of fun. But you have to be the right minded person.
[11:46.560 --> 11:51.000]  You have to have the right drive. You have to have just you have to be a solid strong person. I'm a
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.680]  strong person. And I developed addictions on the road. I definitely I was an alcoholic. And I wasn't
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.640]  a specific drug addict. I was a whatever the fuck you got tonight, drug addict. Let's do it all. I
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.040]  didn't care. There's some drugs I wouldn't do don't get me wrong. But like we're doing party drugs
[12:06.040 --> 12:10.240]  and fucking music drugs. And I would do all of them. If you had them tonight. That was what we were
[12:10.240 --> 12:16.760]  doing tonight was all of whatever you brought to the party. So being on the road, it changed me a lot
[12:16.760 --> 12:20.760]  because there were addictions, there were temptations, but also, the music industry is kind of
[12:20.760 --> 12:26.520]  grody. Like you're lied to a lot, you're manipulated a lot. Until you're signed, you're struggling,
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.560]  you're just struggling to get signed or make it or have some support. Once you get support and you
[12:31.560 --> 12:35.760]  get signed, then you're there, bitch, you're working just you're trying to find someone to work
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.400]  for. And then once you get someone to work for, you're just working for them. They give you money,
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.040]  but every couple of weeks, they want to progress support. Like, how many shows have you played? How
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.760]  many shirts have you sold? How's the recording going? Have you booked the next tour? Is every
[12:46.760 --> 12:50.880]  member of the band healthy? How's your drug habit going? How's the van running? And it's, that's
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.360]  just normal responsibilities. But also we're in a band trying to write music, play music and enjoy
[12:55.360 --> 13:01.040]  this without. So all of the logistics, playing a club playing at a club all night long, or three
[13:01.040 --> 13:04.840]  nights in a row, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and then going to
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.680]  collect the money from the club owner, and they're a total dick about the deal that they wrote you.
[13:08.840 --> 13:13.400]  And you've got it in text message or email or between another promoter. And the promoter says the
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.320]  club should pay you the club says the promoter supposed to pay you. You just played three nights
[13:17.320 --> 13:19.840]  in a town, you don't know where the fuck you are. You don't have any friends there. You don't have
[13:19.840 --> 13:24.480]  any backup. And the club just stiffed you. That kind of shit puts like a salty flavor in your
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.240]  mouth. So once you get that sort of stuff, when you're it sucks the passion out of it, when you
[13:28.240 --> 13:33.400]  thought you were gonna have a hotel room and dinner and gas money, and you don't, it starts to piss
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.920]  you off and the music isn't as good. And then the four guys in the van, you're not as close anymore,
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.080]  because you're hungry and you're pissed off. And now when he farted in the van before it used to be
[13:44.080 --> 13:47.920]  funny, but now that I'm hungry and pissed off, when he farted in the van, I want to punch him in the
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.720]  fucking mouth. And it just goes that way. And then it builds up. And it kind of sucks the passion out
[13:51.720 --> 13:54.280]  of it. Honestly, for me, you can tell that I'm getting some weird emotions out of it already
[13:54.280 --> 13:57.640]  talking about punching somebody in the mouth. Just hypothetically, you guys ain't gonna hit nobody
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.280]  never did. But being in the van and being broken, hungry, it changes your mindset. You're like, do I
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.400]  really want to do this? I love the music, but like, I could just go get a job and it wouldn't be as bad
[14:07.400 --> 14:11.920]  as this is today. And that's only sometimes then there's the one hour a night when you're on stage
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.720]  and everybody's putting lights on you and taking pictures of you and screaming your name and singing
[14:15.720 --> 14:20.160]  your lyrics. That's fucking cool. But the work that goes along with that you're either working to get
[14:20.160 --> 14:24.200]  hired or you're hired and you're somebody's bitch. Once you're hired and signed, then you're working
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.120]  for a record company or a promoter and they want a lot you're their bitch and it's a job at that
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.520]  point. Whatever your band is went from like, Patreon the rock band to Patreon Inc. Now you got
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.960]  to get insurance, licensing taxes, it gets way different. Then I got a job at Guitar Center
[14:40.960 --> 14:44.400]  because with all my musical knowledge and abilities, I was like I could definitely work at
[14:44.400 --> 14:49.880]  Guitar Center. Dude, I would work at Guitar Center for an eight hour shift. And when you get in the
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.640]  car, most people when you get in the car after work, you crank up some music and drive fast,
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.720]  right? I would fucking turn down the music. I didn't want to hear anything after working at Guitar
[14:58.720 --> 15:05.840]  Center all day. I could hear the guitar department playing Inner Sandman, ACDC, fucking Back in
[15:05.840 --> 15:12.840]  Black or Welcome to the Jungle or Walk by Pantera all day long. It'd be the same five songs all
[15:12.840 --> 15:17.960]  freaking day long. Fucking what's the one the Crazy Train, you hear Crazy Train all the fucking
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.120]  time at Guitar Center. Or just some basic blues solo from everybody in there. They all think that
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.040]  they're the coolest, they never played it before. You're the third person today to come into Guitar
[15:26.040 --> 15:31.160]  Center and play that lick, I promise you. But bet between the music industry and Guitar Center,
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.720]  learning about the music business and then learning about the music equipment industry, how
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.880]  they're just kind of some they make you think you're buying one thing and you're really not. The
[15:39.880 --> 15:44.840]  things that the artists have, you can't really buy that unless you get a custom made and shit. But I
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.320]  felt bamboozled by both the music industry and the gear industry. So yeah, it did make me a little
[15:49.320 --> 15:55.360]  bit bitter. Let's see there is more change how you make music feel. Now if I could play in a band now
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.760]  with just like a bunch of old guys around here local, I'm not saying old guys, I'm fucking 40
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.840]  something years old. If I could get a bunch of 40 or 50 year old guys that just wanted to play for
[16:03.840 --> 16:08.840]  fun, and there were no contracts, no alcohol, no drugs, and none of that shit involved. It would be
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.040]  a lot of fun just to just say, hey, learn these 10 tracks and we'll go play them in the garage
[16:13.040 --> 16:17.440]  tomorrow so that all of our wives can hang out and watch us play like rock stars. That would be fun.
[16:17.440 --> 16:21.760]  That's where it would be fun for me. But like being on the road and all that shit, the spotlight and
[16:21.760 --> 16:26.800]  shit with music doesn't sound fun anymore. So yeah, it did change how I feel about it. Our friend
[16:26.800 --> 16:31.600]  wrapped this message up with gave my mom a hug. That is super cool. Thank you, bro. Tell mama that
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.720]  you got your message on the podcast. All right, I'm gonna keep going. This next message came from our
[16:36.720 --> 16:43.440]  friend Uncle GG. It says what's your favorite song to play while in the garden or while gardening in
[16:43.440 --> 16:49.480]  general? Dang, I think the edibles I ate are kicking in because as I was reading that the words got
[16:49.480 --> 16:54.240]  smaller and the lights got brighter. So something's happening over here. Um, what was the question? I
[16:54.240 --> 17:00.280]  don't even remember. Favorite song to play while in the garden or while gardening in general? That's a
[17:00.280 --> 17:04.440]  very good question. I know I have vague answers for all of these questions. I'm going to say that
[17:04.440 --> 17:11.520]  depends on a lot of things. Um, what is the mood that I'm already in when I walk into the garden?
[17:11.520 --> 17:17.240]  Is that mood the mood I need to be in? Or do I need to shift my mood? So maybe I just went to lunch
[17:17.240 --> 17:22.160]  and like I came back to hyper and I can't focus or something. Maybe I'll put on like a Joe Rogan
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.800]  podcast just to slow down my brain and just kind of get me into what Rogan saying and then I'll slow
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.280]  down a little bit. Or maybe the opposite. Maybe I smoke too many fucking dabs on my lunch break and
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.200]  I'm fucking goofy, right? Can't figure it out. That's when I'll go in and put on some fucking like
[17:36.280 --> 17:42.800]  really fast fish like punch you in the eye or something by fish tube. Maybe Simpson or first tube
[17:42.800 --> 17:49.040]  or Sigma Oasis or something. Fucking say it to me Santos. Put some shit like that on and that'll give
[17:49.040 --> 17:54.160]  me some energy and get me moved up. But it all just depends on the needed shift, the needed change or
[17:54.160 --> 17:59.000]  the needed vibe. If there's a lot of people in the grow, we'll just put on some classic rock and turn
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.640]  it down kind of low. One thing that I like to do in a commercial grow that really encourages people to
[18:03.640 --> 18:08.440]  get there first is if you were first in the commercial grow that I manage, if you're the first
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.600]  employee there, you get to pick the music for the first quarter of the day. So that means from eight
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.200]  o'clock until 10 o'clock, the music is your choice. We got guys that listen to country. We got guys that
[18:17.200 --> 18:22.040]  listen to death metal. There's a guy that listens to this weird math metal. The same rhythm doesn't happen
[18:22.040 --> 18:26.400]  more than twice. And it's all in like really odd fucking time signatures. But that's what the dude
[18:26.400 --> 18:31.240]  likes. If he's there first, bro, we're listening to math metal for two hours. I got a guy that listens to
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.120]  crazy rap. We got a guy that listens to old school hip hop. You never know what you might get. But the
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.960]  first one to get there gets to put on the fucking music. So it does it mainly it fits up to me and my
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.720]  personal growth depends on the mental state that I need to be in. If I need to, if I'm like sweeping
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.600]  floors and just doing like stuff where I'm not paying super super attention, I might have some faster,
[18:50.600 --> 18:56.240]  louder, funkier music on it's going to be most likely some fish you never know could be some reggae
[18:56.240 --> 19:00.120]  could be some old school Grateful Dead. It could be mo I like to listen to a lot of mo in the garden that
[19:00.120 --> 19:04.400]  gives you a lot of energy. But like I said, if it's something where I if I'm cutting clones, and I need to
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.960]  slow down like pay attention or something, then I may put on like a slower podcast that just like kind of,
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.600]  or maybe even some slower, older Grateful Dead just to get my brain in that slower pace. Instead of zipping
[19:15.600 --> 19:21.080]  through the job, want to go a little bit more patiently have a little bit more focus, get the job done a
[19:21.080 --> 19:26.960]  little bit more. What's the word I'm looking for mindfulness want to be more aware be there. Be here
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.320]  now that's the thing I'm going for sometimes. But also when you're just doing that labor work on a
[19:31.320 --> 19:36.000]  check the fuck out and then you put on crazy music and jam out. All right, Uncle GG I do thank you for
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.480]  the great question. Keep the good patreon questions going. I've got another one right here in front of
[19:40.480 --> 19:47.720]  me. I feel those them chocolates is kicking in you guys my eyes are getting super warm. This one this
[19:47.760 --> 19:54.000]  this one see I can't even talk anymore. I said this one this message this next one came from my friend.
[19:54.280 --> 19:59.800]  He calls himself all mixed up. We also call him 311 in the live feeds and in the chats. It says where's a
[19:59.800 --> 20:06.520]  place you would like to visit that is a really good question. Of course I want to go to Jamaica just kick
[20:06.520 --> 20:11.040]  it on the island of Jamaica. Then I want to disappear into the hills of Jamaica got to spend a day in
[20:11.040 --> 20:16.960]  Kingston, Jamaica. Let's go all over all over Jamaica. Have I said Jamaica enough then randomly I would
[20:16.960 --> 20:21.840]  love to visit Germany and there's a lot of cool shit in Germany. Looks like a lot of cool castles a lot of
[20:21.840 --> 20:28.320]  cool scenery a lot of great shit. Then all over that Amsterdam area, all that part of Europe I just want to
[20:28.320 --> 20:32.640]  go hit all that start in Europe maybe and just take a bus every day to whatever you could get to or a train.
[20:33.040 --> 20:37.920]  All that area of Europe looks very interesting to me got to hit Italy because I want to try some fucking good
[20:37.920 --> 20:45.200]  Italian food. Um, where else would I like to go? I wrote down Sweden, Miss Irie or dread vibes or Zara as you
[20:45.200 --> 20:50.600]  know her is originally from Sweden. She's only been here in the States for about 10 years. I would love to go to
[20:50.600 --> 20:56.280]  Sweden and see the things that she tells me about. She tells me about her childhood and her life before she
[20:56.280 --> 21:01.320]  came to the States and she tells me how different it is there and like just subtle differences and major
[21:01.320 --> 21:06.280]  differences in a lot of things. I would like to go experience that smell the air, see the mountain and the
[21:06.280 --> 21:10.840]  city and all the stuff that she talks about. Go see Stockholm because she tells me a lot about that. That
[21:10.840 --> 21:15.880]  would be a fun time. Just another way to just I've never thought of going to Sweden until I got with her and it
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.000]  sounds like a lot of fun and it's really random. So that'd be super cool. Um, then a random place that I wrote
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.080]  down, which is really attainable. It's just all about timing and I've never bothered to do this, uh, is the DW
[21:27.080 --> 21:33.200]  factory in Oxnard, California. Um, I am a drummer. I've played the drums. I've said this on the show maybe today
[21:33.200 --> 21:40.480]  since I was about 14 years old. I really enjoy DW collector series drums. That's something I'm fond of. They are
[21:40.480 --> 21:47.440]  made in a factory in Oxnard, California. Occasionally they do DW day and you get to go do tours for some reason. I
[21:47.440 --> 21:53.800]  feel giddy inside when I think about going to do a DW tour. It sounds great. You get to watch them simply make drum
[21:53.800 --> 21:58.400]  sets. I know it sounds crazy. You could watch how it's made, right? But I want to smell the different kinds of
[21:58.400 --> 22:03.400]  wood. I want to hear the machines. I want to be in there. Um, I'm fond of the guy that owns the company. His name's
[22:03.400 --> 22:08.280]  John Good. I want to shake John Good's hand. Uh, he's known as the wood whisperer. I want to talk to him about
[22:08.280 --> 22:14.600]  wood. I know that sounds crazy, but I'm a tone wood nerd. If you know what tone wood, uh, maples and different
[22:14.600 --> 22:20.520]  types of wood and flame maple and, uh, you could use all kinds of wood for drums now, but, uh, Sitka spruce and
[22:20.520 --> 22:24.720]  shit, dude, I'm in love with that stuff. So I'd love to, I'm obviously the fucking edibles that are working. I'm
[22:24.720 --> 22:31.800]  talking about wood at the DW factory. I would really love to go tour the DW factory in Oxnard, California. They
[22:31.800 --> 22:37.200]  quit doing the tours, uh, because of the pandemic, but they've opened up again. It's on a very limited basis. One
[22:37.200 --> 22:42.240]  day when I'm in Southern California and the wife's got some stuff to do and I'm freed up, that's what I'm going to go
[22:42.640 --> 22:48.280]  see the DW tour. I don't need to punish her and take her with me. I want to keep her. I love it because you'll go see DW
[22:48.280 --> 22:52.680]  drums. You'll meet John Good. And then you never know which of your favorite drummers could pop in every day. They
[22:52.680 --> 22:57.400]  just show random people like, look who popped into the DW offices today. And it could be your favorite drummer.
[22:57.600 --> 23:03.920]  Anybody from like Eric Moore to Thomas Lang to Peter Erskine, all kinds of great people are DW endorses. So you
[23:03.920 --> 23:08.320]  never know who could pop in. You never know. I could get a free drum lesson, throw some paradiddles with one of my
[23:08.320 --> 23:15.480]  favorite drummers. Never know. I am high as giraffe pussy and I am rambling about the DW factory tour. Now that is
[23:15.480 --> 23:21.440]  great. All right. So I think my favorite places I would choose to go would be Jamaica, Germany. I think that Germany
[23:21.440 --> 23:26.760]  trip, I want to alter it a little bit. We're going to start by landing in Amsterdam and then that'll be the home base.
[23:26.760 --> 23:32.920]  And then of course we'll hit coffee shops and then just take day trips all to all the places all around there. Uh, got to
[23:32.920 --> 23:39.240]  visit Sweden because that's where the queen is from. And then that DW factory in Oxnard, California, of course, is on the
[23:39.240 --> 23:44.120]  list just for shits and giggles. All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, that feels like the chocolates that I
[23:44.120 --> 23:49.680]  ate before this show are starting to do their thing. So it is time for me to wrap up this YouTube portion of the
[23:49.680 --> 23:55.800]  podcast. I'm going to continue this show in just a few minutes on Patreon. I'm going to take a little bit of a break, uh, get a
[23:55.800 --> 24:02.560]  drink in myself, uh, reorganize my notes here, get some fresh air. Then I will be back to do a Patreon only podcast. If you
[24:02.560 --> 24:07.680]  want to check out the, uh, the edibles version of this podcast, part two of this, where I talk a lot more about the
[24:07.680 --> 24:14.200]  chocolates that I ate, please do check out patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. Of course, there is a link in the
[24:14.200 --> 24:19.720]  show notes and in the video description, the lights are getting brighter. The shit is starting to work. Ladies and
[24:19.720 --> 24:25.320]  gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful

[24:50.760 --> 24:56.240]  hard. My mouth is getting dry at it's time to wrap up this show for a moment, take a break, slot myself in the cheek a couple of
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.880]  times, get my shit together, and I'll be back for that Patreon show. I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new
[25:00.880 --> 25:07.840]  content. I want to give a big shout out to my friend B Bala. And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
