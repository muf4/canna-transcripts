[00:02.560 --> 00:07.360]  Yeah, what up podcast world? It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you with episode
[00:07.360 --> 00:11.520]  number 106 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news,
[00:11.520 --> 00:15.880]  education, and conversation. You guys, I'm coming to you with another show from the
[00:15.880 --> 00:19.920]  car. You guys, I've been traveling back and forth between Colorado Springs and
[00:19.920 --> 00:23.660]  Pueblo quite a bit lately and it's an hour drive each direction so I have had
[00:23.660 --> 00:27.000]  a lot of time to think and I have definitely had some time to do some
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.920]  recording. So here I am on the microphone traveling on the interstate. It is
[00:30.920 --> 00:34.560]  Wednesday, November 18th. I plan on putting this episode out on Thursday the
[00:34.560 --> 00:38.600]  19th so this is just gonna be a bonus episode and I hope you guys enjoy it. I
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.040]  want to make a very special announcement while I'm here. You guys, as of yesterday
[00:43.040 --> 00:48.560]  around noon, I am no longer involved with the spot dispensary. I have severed all
[00:48.560 --> 00:52.080]  ties with the spot dispensary. I am not employed by them. I am not affiliated
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.860]  with them and I am not advertising for the spot in any way any longer. So I want
[00:56.860 --> 01:00.800]  to say goodbye to the spot dispensary. I don't work there anymore. It was fun but
[01:00.880 --> 01:07.020]  I've got to do other things with myself. I have no hard feelings or ill will or
[01:07.020 --> 01:10.540]  any hatred or anything toward the spot. I just need to move on. Sometimes there are
[01:10.540 --> 01:14.620]  other options in life that you need to follow or need to pursue and that's what
[01:14.620 --> 01:20.180]  I'm going to do with myself. So that being said, let me make one more huge
[01:20.180 --> 01:26.420]  announcement. As of today around noon, I am officially the lead cultivator at
[01:26.440 --> 01:31.240]  Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado. That's right you guys.
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.880]  I quit a job yesterday and I've got a new job today. So big shout out to Hunt
[01:35.880 --> 01:41.000]  and the Grammy Gatsby and the Green and Healthy Wellness crew. A few weeks ago,
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.240]  it was about two weeks ago, when the owner of Green and Healthy Wellness gave me a
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.440]  call and he said, hey bro, do you know anybody that would be qualified to run a
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.440]  large grow? And I said yeah, what do you need? And he gave me a nice description
[01:53.440 --> 01:57.460]  of the job and he told me what would be required. And I said, you know, I think I
[01:57.460 --> 02:00.460]  want that job. And he was like, no way. And I was like, no for real, I want the job
[02:00.460 --> 02:03.940]  because I'm not happy with what I'm doing. So we talked about it for a couple
[02:03.940 --> 02:07.220]  of weeks. I drove up and checked out the grow. I've spent a lot of time in the grow.
[02:07.220 --> 02:11.100]  I've spent a lot of time with the crew and it is a go you guys. This is where I
[02:11.100 --> 02:15.620]  need to be. I need to be working at Green and Healthy Wellness with Hunt, with
[02:15.620 --> 02:20.220]  Damsel, with Randall's. I need to be there. It's part of the team. So team Dreadlocks
[02:20.320 --> 02:23.360]  is getting a little bit stronger. Shout out to Green and Healthy Wellness for
[02:23.360 --> 02:27.640]  having faith in me and giving me the opportunity to be the lead grower. You
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.280]  guys, I'm going to be the one producing all of the medicine for their medical
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.160]  marijuana shop in Colorado Springs. So if you're a medical patient, look forward to,
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.200]  we should have a harvest coming down mid-February-ish is what I have planned
[02:41.200 --> 02:46.640]  in my vision. So around March, around March 1st to St. Patrick's Day-ish, we
[02:46.660 --> 02:50.820]  should have some Rasta Jeff grown flowers available for the medical
[02:50.820 --> 02:55.700]  patients at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Now I want
[02:55.700 --> 02:58.860]  to kind of elaborate here you guys. I want to let you know why I quit the spot
[02:58.860 --> 03:01.060]  and let you know what's going on because I don't want you to think that I hate
[03:01.060 --> 03:05.260]  the spot or that anything shitty happened. I've been at the spot since
[03:05.260 --> 03:10.460]  the middle of July and we have been building and getting things finalized
[03:10.460 --> 03:15.100]  and there is no sign of having plants in that building for at least another month
[03:15.160 --> 03:20.920]  or two. And I am not, I'm not a plumber, I'm not a construction worker. I can do
[03:20.920 --> 03:25.800]  basic things but I've been trying to find stuff to keep me busy for 40 hours
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.800]  a week in the spot for the past month and there's nothing to do. And without
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.760]  plants in there, I've been going crazy you guys. The building is not ready for
[03:33.760 --> 03:39.480]  plants, they're not ready to cultivate. I was expected to be there and perform so
[03:39.480 --> 03:42.800]  it was hard to be there every day with nothing to do. It was making me super
[03:42.860 --> 03:46.520]  anxious, I was making me bored. I was spending way too much time on social
[03:46.520 --> 03:51.020]  media because I was bored at the shop. So when my buddy Hunt called and said hey
[03:51.020 --> 03:55.220]  we need help here at Green and Healthy, it felt like the right thing to do to
[03:55.220 --> 04:00.020]  jump on and be part of the team. At the spot they run hydro, it's a big huge
[04:00.020 --> 04:05.980]  hydro setup. I am not a hydro grower, I am a soil farmer. At the Green and Healthy
[04:05.980 --> 04:12.580]  Grow we're running three gallon pots of soilless mix with plants already in the
[04:12.600 --> 04:16.440]  building. There are plants there waiting for me. So Friday I'm going to move
[04:16.440 --> 04:19.520]  plants to the flowering room and I'm going to give them a little bit of time
[04:19.520 --> 04:23.800]  to veg in the flower room in their new home and about 10 to 14 days after that
[04:23.800 --> 04:28.360]  I plan to flower the first crop for Green and Healthy Wellness. So I'm
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.680]  leaving a facility that will not have plants until my first harvest at my new
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.520]  facility is finished is what it feels like and I'm in it to grow you guys.
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.440]  That's what I'm here for. I want to grow and produce quality cannabis. So I had to
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.820]  make a move. I had to make a huge move. This is an hour drive to and from work
[04:43.820 --> 04:49.060]  every single day but you know what it's a soil garden with my homies the Grimey
[04:49.060 --> 04:53.780]  Gatsby and Dudetz Damsel and John Randalls Jr. So in my mind this is the
[04:53.780 --> 04:58.540]  right decision. Sometimes you got to just you got to make a move that scares you.
[04:58.540 --> 05:00.940]  You got to make a move that puts you on the spot. You got to make a move that
[05:00.940 --> 05:04.660]  breaks you out of your routine and I feel like my life has really been
[05:04.660 --> 05:09.460]  routine for the past couple of years and shaking myself up like this really puts
[05:09.460 --> 05:14.080]  it lights a new fire under my ass so to speak. It puts fresh ideas in my head. I
[05:14.080 --> 05:19.800]  find a new inspiration. I meet new people. I go new places. It really improves my
[05:19.800 --> 05:24.800]  life overall when I put myself in a uncomfortable position. When I break out
[05:24.800 --> 05:28.880]  of my comfort bubble and put myself in a position where I'm not exactly sure how
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.580]  this is gonna play out. It always works very well for myself. So if you guys are
[05:33.580 --> 05:36.760]  scared to do something. If there's something you're thinking about doing. If
[05:36.820 --> 05:40.340]  there's a big change in your life that you're thinking about making. All I can
[05:40.340 --> 05:45.760]  say is grab your balls and do it. Just do it. Don't be afraid. Success is scary but
[05:45.760 --> 05:49.060]  once you succeed and you see what it's like to succeed and not fall down from
[05:49.060 --> 05:52.220]  that. All you're gonna do is want to succeed more and more and more. Your
[05:52.220 --> 05:55.900]  goals are gonna get bigger. Your dreams are gonna get bigger. Your abilities to
[05:55.900 --> 05:59.860]  reach those dreams will get bigger right alongside all of that. So if you're
[05:59.860 --> 06:03.700]  afraid of something don't be scared you guys. You can fucking do it and what's
[06:03.700 --> 06:06.260]  gonna happen? You're gonna try and you're either gonna succeed or you're gonna
[06:06.280 --> 06:09.860]  fail. If you fail you're gonna be right where you are. You're not gonna go
[06:09.860 --> 06:12.960]  backwards by failing because trying something is going to give you skills.
[06:12.960 --> 06:15.800]  You're gonna at least be trying something. You're gonna feel better and
[06:15.800 --> 06:20.440]  if you succeed holy shit you just succeeded at something. You just opened a
[06:20.440 --> 06:23.600]  new door to your life. You just have a new thing you can do or somewhere else
[06:23.600 --> 06:27.480]  you can go and what is that gonna do? That's gonna be a building block for the
[06:27.480 --> 06:31.800]  next places you can go and the next things you can do. So if you're scared. If
[06:31.800 --> 06:34.120]  you're stuck in your comfort zone. If you're stuck in your little bubble you
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.660]  guys. All I can say is step out of that and try to do some new things. I have
[06:38.660 --> 06:42.460]  some faith in the world. Have some faith in yourself. Have some faith in life. Even
[06:42.460 --> 06:46.500]  if you're not a spiritual or a religious person you can have some confidence. You
[06:46.500 --> 06:52.060]  can have some some I guess faith is what you need to have and don't have fear of
[06:52.060 --> 06:57.280]  failing. Your life if your life is good right now and you try something and you
[06:57.280 --> 07:00.620]  fail you're still gonna have the life you've got. Nobody's gonna take it away
[07:00.720 --> 07:04.800]  from you because you messed up trying something new and anybody that does talk
[07:04.800 --> 07:07.600]  shit to you and disrespect you because you tried something new and you failed
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.760]  they are not your friend. Your friends are gonna support you through your
[07:10.760 --> 07:14.440]  failures. Your friends are gonna say man that looks like a challenging task to
[07:14.440 --> 07:17.720]  try to do and I'm proud of you just for getting off your ass and trying it
[07:17.720 --> 07:21.040]  because 75% of the people that are out there wouldn't even have gotten off
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.280]  their asses to attempt what you just failed at. So don't be afraid to fail. You
[07:25.280 --> 07:28.680]  got to try some shit you guys. I guess that's my inspirational talk for the day.
[07:28.680 --> 07:33.780]  That was my announcement for the day. I am driving down I-25 on a beautiful damn
[07:33.780 --> 07:37.860]  Wednesday. It is so gorgeous out here. There's not a cloud in the sky. I can see
[07:37.860 --> 07:41.860]  for a hundred miles. I can see Pikes Peak. I can see the wet mountains. It is such a
[07:41.860 --> 07:46.680]  gorgeous day. So guys get outside suck up some sunshine. The winter is coming. We
[07:46.680 --> 07:50.020]  should talk about how to prepare your growth for the winter I guess pretty
[07:50.020 --> 07:53.400]  soon here. So that's some good shit to talk about. You guys I'm getting out of
[07:53.400 --> 07:56.380]  here. I feel like I'm rambling into this microphone. I hope everybody has a
[07:56.400 --> 08:00.280]  wonderful day. Smoke some great cannabis. Smoke some good hash. Love one another.
[08:00.280 --> 08:03.760]  Don't be afraid to reach your goals and until next time you guys take a fat dab
[08:03.760 --> 10:39.390]  and give your mom a hug for me.
