[01:52.200 --> 01:56.040]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.480]  This is the part of the show where I invite you to join the IRI army that grow from your
[02:00.480 --> 02:03.600]  heart podcast, the IRI genetics discord server.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.600]  That's right.
[02:04.600 --> 02:08.720]  We've got a discord server with a little bit over 1000 members.
[02:08.720 --> 02:10.440]  I hang out in the discord channel.
[02:10.440 --> 02:11.560]  I joined the voice chat.
[02:11.560 --> 02:13.000]  I joined the video chat.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.840]  I'm always in the chat just typing stuff in the group chats, the general chat, the IRI
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.960]  chat.

[02:19.160 --> 02:24.080]  We do some giveaways, some other things happen over there that you may be interested in.

[02:26.320 --> 02:32.040]  There is a link in the very top of the show notes and in the video description.
[02:32.040 --> 02:34.960]  I do want to apologize for the last episode.
[02:34.960 --> 02:39.140]  It was not up to the quality of the standards that I am used to delivering.
[02:39.140 --> 02:41.920]  There were a couple of technical issues, a couple of glitches.
[02:41.920 --> 02:44.320]  I did have to cut out part of that podcast.
[02:44.320 --> 02:45.880]  I'm not making any excuses.
[02:45.880 --> 02:48.240]  It's all my fault, but I do apologize.
[02:48.240 --> 02:50.320]  It was not what I am used to delivering.
[02:50.320 --> 02:52.040]  I will do better this time.
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.920]  We're learning new gear.
[02:54.920 --> 02:57.840]  Sometimes some equipment's not going to cooperate.
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.920]  Sometimes some memory cards will have a bad day and things will go wrong.
[03:00.920 --> 03:03.920]  We will do our best to work around those things.
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.480]  Anyway, thank you for all the feedback, the questions, the corrections, the comments,
[03:08.480 --> 03:10.720]  and the concerns from the last episode.
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.320]  I do appreciate it and I will do better in the future.
[03:15.320 --> 03:16.600]  Where do we go from here?
[03:16.600 --> 03:17.800]  New merchandise.
[03:17.800 --> 03:19.400]  I am working on new merchandise.
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.160]  In a previous episode, I did ask for merchandise ideas.
[03:23.160 --> 03:27.720]  I wanted your feedback, your input, because you will be the people wearing the merchandise,
[03:27.720 --> 03:30.360]  playing with the merchandise, rocking the gear.
[03:30.360 --> 03:33.400]  Whatever I have made, printed, designed, you will be the ones rocking it.
[03:33.400 --> 03:35.120]  So I did want your feedback.
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.320]  There are some new things coming.
[03:37.320 --> 03:41.240]  Some of the merch will take approximately 10 to 12 weeks to be printed and sent to me
[03:41.240 --> 03:43.840]  or designed and built and made and sent to me.
[03:43.840 --> 03:46.600]  Other things will be ready in approximately two to four weeks.
[03:46.920 --> 03:49.240]  We're in a really weird time right now for ordering things.
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.400]  We're coming out of one phase and into another phase and possibly back to another phase of
[03:53.400 --> 03:55.320]  the world right now.
[03:55.320 --> 03:57.040]  Buying, shipping, receiving is weird.
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.720]  There is new merchandise coming.
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.400]  Thank you for all of the great feedback and input when I did ask for merchandise ideas.
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.440]  You guys did a wonderful, guys and gals, did a wonderful job.
[04:07.440 --> 04:09.760]  So look forward to new merchandise coming.
[04:09.760 --> 04:12.760]  That stuff will be on the website when it is available.
[04:12.760 --> 04:15.400]  It will pop up on the iRegenetics web store.
[04:15.400 --> 04:18.360]  How can you stay updated and know when the new stuff arrives?
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.880]  That's a really good question.
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.600]  All you have to do is go to the website, scroll approximately halfway down.
[04:23.600 --> 04:26.920]  There's a spot that you can join the iRegenetics newsletter.
[04:26.920 --> 04:30.960]  When you join that newsletter, approximately once a month, you'll get an update that will
[04:30.960 --> 04:33.080]  let you know what new merch is available.
[04:33.080 --> 04:36.960]  It will let you know what new strains may be available, what coupon codes are active.
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.640]  I try to make a new coupon code every month for either the merchandise store or maybe
[04:41.640 --> 04:43.400]  for a vendor.
[04:43.400 --> 04:48.960]  Stay up to date, coupon codes, new drops, new merchandise, it all comes out in the newsletter.
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.080]  I only try to send them out about once a month.
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.840]  I try not to overload you, bombard you with too much stuff, but I do try to keep you updated,
[04:55.840 --> 04:59.880]  send you some coupon codes, some discounts, things like that, some news.
[04:59.880 --> 05:03.480]  If I'm going to be on a special podcast or do a special event, I try to let you know
[05:03.480 --> 05:04.480]  through the newsletter.
[05:04.480 --> 05:10.560]  So go to the website, iRegenetics.com, scroll down, find the newsletter section, put in
[05:10.560 --> 05:13.440]  your email address, you'll be added to the newsletter.
[05:13.440 --> 05:15.600]  And then once a month, you will get an update.
[05:15.600 --> 05:17.580]  It will let you know what's going on.
[05:17.580 --> 05:22.360]  My goal is to have this new gear, most of it in stock.
[05:22.360 --> 05:26.440]  The new merchandise, I'm hoping to have a lot of it here for Black Friday so we can
[05:26.440 --> 05:29.360]  do a Black Friday sale and get you guys a lot of new gear.
[05:29.360 --> 05:33.240]  A lot of people have been asking for some of the shirt sizes that are sold out.
[05:33.240 --> 05:34.560]  I'm going to replace those.
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.240]  I will add new designs, try to get that here for Black Friday.
[05:38.240 --> 05:42.080]  The stuff that doesn't make it by Black Friday, I'm trying to have it for Christmas.
[05:42.080 --> 05:46.120]  Then we'll find out what sells well and we'll restock that stuff and hopefully have it for
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.120]  the Indo Expo.
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.160]  So you'll have a few opportunities for new merchandise.
[05:50.160 --> 05:51.320]  Stay tuned.
[05:51.320 --> 05:52.320]  Things are coming.
[05:52.320 --> 05:53.440]  I mentioned the Indo Expo.
[05:53.440 --> 05:54.440]  That's right.
[05:54.440 --> 05:57.560]  February, February 4th and 5th in Denver.
[05:57.560 --> 06:01.680]  I'm going to grab my phone and rudely here, make sure that I'm telling you the right date
[06:01.680 --> 06:03.040]  because I don't want to give you the wrong date.
[06:03.040 --> 06:05.400]  It is February.
[06:05.400 --> 06:06.400]  That is right, February.
[06:06.400 --> 06:07.400]  Nope.
[06:07.560 --> 06:09.360]  February 5th and 6th in Denver, Colorado.
[06:09.360 --> 06:10.360]  That's right.
[06:10.360 --> 06:11.920]  The Indo Expo in Denver.
[06:11.920 --> 06:12.920]  Join us.
[06:12.920 --> 06:17.120]  iRegenetics will be at the Indo Expo in Denver, Colorado, February 5th and 6th.
[06:17.120 --> 06:21.000]  I'm going to verify that date one more time just because I'm really wanting to be sure
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  to give you the right date.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.660]  The Friday, no, it's the Saturday and Sunday is the 5th and 6th.
[06:25.660 --> 06:26.660]  That is correct.
[06:26.660 --> 06:29.120]  5 and 6 of February 2022.
[06:29.120 --> 06:35.320]  I'm not sure if I said the year, but February 2022, the Indo Expo will be at a different
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.320]  location.
[06:36.320 --> 06:37.920]  I don't know if you're used to joining us at the Indo Expo.
[06:37.920 --> 06:40.160]  It will not be at the Denver Mart this year.
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.400]  It will be at the Denver Convention Center.
[06:42.400 --> 06:46.360]  So make your plans accordingly, maybe some adjustments to make there.
[06:46.360 --> 06:52.720]  I look forward to seeing you at the Denver Indo Expo, February 5th and 6th, 2022.
[06:52.720 --> 06:54.800]  It feels weird to say 2022.
[06:54.800 --> 06:57.560]  Got to look over at the phone and make sure I'm saying the right date.
[06:57.560 --> 06:59.720]  We're talking about far into the future here.
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.880]  Join us at the Indo Expo, guys.
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.400]  We should have some cool merch and plenty of strains available.
[07:04.400 --> 07:05.400]  All right.
[07:05.480 --> 07:07.600]  That is enough rambling at the top of the show here.
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.160]  I do have some cannabis related content.
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.800]  That is what you tuned in for.
[07:11.800 --> 07:13.800]  I've got a great question here in front of me.
[07:13.800 --> 07:14.800]  All right.
[07:14.800 --> 07:15.800]  This question comes from a friend.
[07:15.800 --> 07:16.920]  Do they want their name said?
[07:16.920 --> 07:20.120]  I don't see their name on here, so I don't think they want their name said.
[07:20.120 --> 07:22.200]  Let's just keep them safe and anonymous.
[07:22.200 --> 07:24.080]  Their question goes a lot like this.
[07:24.080 --> 07:27.320]  It says, I had an intersex plant seed.
[07:27.320 --> 07:33.400]  All of my females are the seeds feminized or are they intersex plants?
[07:33.400 --> 07:34.720]  That is a good question.
[07:35.040 --> 07:40.040]  This grower had a plant that they did not notice it was turning intersex in their garden.
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.560]  That is a common thing that does happen.
[07:42.560 --> 07:45.080]  It seeded all of their female plants.
[07:45.080 --> 07:47.240]  Now, they've got a bunch of seeds in the garden.
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.340]  The main question is, are the seeds that come from this going to be feminized or are they
[07:52.340 --> 07:54.720]  more intersex seeds?
[07:54.720 --> 07:57.240]  That's a very good question, a very common question.
[07:57.240 --> 08:01.120]  The first thing I can say is they are not feminized.
[08:01.120 --> 08:05.880]  They came from an intersex plant, which means they've got an intersex trait, which means
[08:05.880 --> 08:10.140]  you may find more intersex traits in the offspring.
[08:10.140 --> 08:14.880]  You may get some straight females out of there, but you may get a bunch of intersex plants.
[08:14.880 --> 08:19.780]  You will not get feminized seeds out of here because they were not made from a properly
[08:19.780 --> 08:23.400]  reversed female plant with proper feminizing technique.
[08:23.400 --> 08:24.580]  There's more of a method to that.
[08:24.580 --> 08:26.440]  There's more selection to that.
[08:26.440 --> 08:28.800]  Fem seeds are not made from intersex plants.
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.080]  If they are, then the offspring will display that intersex trait.
[08:33.080 --> 08:37.400]  The pollen donor on this plant was actually an intersex plant, which means you are putting
[08:37.400 --> 08:42.680]  50% of your offspring of the cross of that is intersex.
[08:42.680 --> 08:46.320]  You're going to get a very strong likelihood of intersex plants.
[08:46.320 --> 08:48.600]  You do not have fems.
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.080]  They may be intersex, but you may find some amazing females.
[08:52.080 --> 08:58.120]  I talk a lot about how some of the most popular prolific strains we smoke and consume and
[08:58.120 --> 09:01.000]  breed with now were accidents.
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.680]  The chem dog was an accident.
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.000]  Sour diesel was allegedly an accident.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.960]  Gorilla glue number four was an accident.
[09:07.960 --> 09:09.640]  Golden goat was an accident.
[09:09.640 --> 09:13.760]  A lot of the greatest shit we talk about were accidents.
[09:13.760 --> 09:16.240]  You may have a bunch of intersex junk.
[09:16.240 --> 09:20.480]  You could have some amazing gems or you could have complete trash in there.
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.780]  The best way to find out is to grow them.
[09:22.780 --> 09:23.980]  Don't give them to any friends.
[09:23.980 --> 09:26.260]  Don't spread them out.
[09:26.260 --> 09:29.700]  Don't put these potentially problematic seeds in any other gardens.
[09:29.700 --> 09:30.940]  Grow them in your garden.
[09:30.940 --> 09:33.060]  Pay close attention to them.
[09:33.060 --> 09:35.220]  Grow them until they're big enough to get a clone.
[09:35.220 --> 09:36.580]  Pull a clone off of it.
[09:36.580 --> 09:37.580]  That way you've got a keeper.
[09:37.580 --> 09:40.460]  That way if you come up with the next chem dog, you've got a keeper and you don't grow
[09:40.460 --> 09:42.300]  it one time and get heartbroken.
[09:42.300 --> 09:45.620]  Get a clone, grow it, flower it out, find out what you've got.
[09:45.620 --> 09:49.660]  You could have, like I said before, they could all turn intersex right away.
[09:49.660 --> 09:51.640]  They could turn intersex mid flower.
[09:51.640 --> 09:53.760]  They could turn intersex late flower.
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.800]  Pay attention to every single plant very carefully.
[09:56.800 --> 09:57.920]  Weed out the junk.
[09:57.920 --> 09:58.920]  Keep the champions.
[09:58.920 --> 10:00.800]  Maybe you've got something amazing.
[10:00.800 --> 10:02.880]  Run 10 or 20 of those seeds.
[10:02.880 --> 10:05.120]  That's going to tell you a good idea of what you've got.
[10:05.120 --> 10:07.880]  If more than half of them are intersex, don't run any more of them.
[10:07.880 --> 10:11.760]  Get rid of them is my opinion unless you really want to run the risk and you don't have more
[10:11.760 --> 10:12.800]  seeds to play with.
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.120]  Those are free seeds.
[10:14.120 --> 10:15.200]  Those are testers.
[10:15.200 --> 10:16.360]  See what you've got there.
[10:16.360 --> 10:17.360]  All right.
[10:17.360 --> 10:18.520]  Thank you for the great message.
[10:18.520 --> 10:21.600]  You did not say that you want your name included, so I'm not going to say your name here on
[10:21.600 --> 10:22.640]  the show.
[10:22.640 --> 10:23.640]  Big shout out.
[10:23.640 --> 10:25.200]  You know who you are.
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.320]  Next time you're going to have to keep an eye on that intersex plant a little bit better
[10:28.320 --> 10:30.600]  and make sure you don't get a whole bunch of seeds.
[10:30.600 --> 10:34.760]  Hopefully you got some smokable, consumable product out of that as well.
[10:34.760 --> 10:37.640]  Hopefully you got something to use and now you learned something.
[10:37.640 --> 10:38.640]  All right.
[10:38.640 --> 10:40.440]  This question comes from my friend.
[10:40.440 --> 10:44.120]  I'm not sure if I should say their name because they are asking industry questions.
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.640]  Let's just not single my friend out and say his name.
[10:46.640 --> 10:48.520]  Bro, thank you for the great question.
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.520]  You know who you are.
[10:49.520 --> 10:51.520]  I consider you a bro, a friend.
[10:51.520 --> 10:52.720]  This one came from my friend.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.040]  It says, I've got a good question from you.
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.680]  I just finished listening to the phenotype episode and I wanted to get your input on
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.880]  how you feel about commercial growers using autos and untested genetics.
[11:04.880 --> 11:06.400]  All right.
[11:06.400 --> 11:11.920]  So he's asking how I feel about commercial cultivation facilities using auto flower plants
[11:11.920 --> 11:13.920]  and untested genetics.
[11:13.920 --> 11:18.200]  With all of the states starting to realize medical and recreational cannabis isn't going
[11:18.200 --> 11:23.240]  away, there are a lot of folks with cash but zero to minimal knowledge on how to grow
[11:23.240 --> 11:26.520]  or even what to look for in a plant.
[11:26.520 --> 11:28.840]  That is absolutely true.
[11:28.840 --> 11:33.420]  Now that I've been working in the industry a few months, it's wild how many growers just
[11:33.420 --> 11:37.040]  get clones or seeds from someone and just run them.
[11:37.040 --> 11:40.600]  Yeah, unfortunately sometimes that's the option.
[11:40.600 --> 11:42.120]  That is the only thing to do.
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.360]  It is just get some seeds or clones and just run them and figure it out.
[11:45.360 --> 11:47.520]  You got to figure it out somehow.
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.160]  And yeah, it would be much better to run tested genetics.
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.480]  But if you get a clone from somebody, even if they ran it and they tested it, they ran
[11:55.480 --> 11:56.480]  it and they tested it.
[11:56.480 --> 11:58.800]  That's like somebody dating a girl and telling you, no, she's great, bro.
[11:58.800 --> 11:59.800]  You should marry her.
[11:59.800 --> 12:01.060]  And you're like, you dated her, not me.
[12:01.060 --> 12:03.000]  Maybe it's a different, maybe we're into different shit.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  You know what I mean?
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.120]  So yeah, you should do your own selection, but you've got to get your seeds and clones
[12:08.120 --> 12:09.540]  from somewhere.
[12:09.540 --> 12:15.100]  So you've got to use your resources, especially in a new, uh, an emerging market without a
[12:15.100 --> 12:16.460]  lot of resources.
[12:16.460 --> 12:20.000]  Let me read more into this and we will talk about doing selection and things like that.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.580]  It's wild how many growers just get seeds, clones from someone and just run them.
[12:23.580 --> 12:28.180]  I understand it's a huge time saver, especially for those newly legal states, but I find it
[12:28.180 --> 12:33.540]  as an easy way out unless those growers are explaining that they are working toward creating
[12:33.540 --> 12:36.460]  and finding their own strains and their medical purposes.
[12:36.780 --> 12:40.940]  Uh, in the meantime are running some things they believe it's just the best option until
[12:40.940 --> 12:43.580]  they get their own stuff up and running.
[12:43.580 --> 12:46.820]  A lot of times it's all about where do you get a clone?
[12:46.820 --> 12:48.300]  Where do you get the plants?
[12:48.300 --> 12:50.960]  Everybody's going to want to have OG Kush on the shelf.
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.340]  Everybody wants chem dog, sour diesel, bubble gum.
[12:54.340 --> 12:58.780]  All the old guys want Acapulco gold, Panama red.
[12:58.780 --> 13:02.260]  Everyone's going to have the stuff that they grew up with, like around when they were 18
[13:02.260 --> 13:05.300]  or 19 and they were smoking that, that's what they're going to go to the dispensary and
[13:05.300 --> 13:06.300]  ask for.
[13:07.140 --> 13:08.140]  That's the most popular shit.
[13:08.140 --> 13:10.060]  If you're younger, you're going to want sour diesel or girl scout cookies.
[13:10.060 --> 13:12.380]  If you're a little older, you might ask for white widow.
[13:12.380 --> 13:16.140]  If you're even older, you want that fucking Acapulco gold and that older shit.
[13:16.140 --> 13:18.220]  So it's all about what people want.
[13:18.220 --> 13:19.660]  But then how do you get that?
[13:19.660 --> 13:20.660]  Who's got the clone?
[13:20.660 --> 13:24.420]  If you're in some new state that just came legal and there's not a big market and you're
[13:24.420 --> 13:30.240]  not into the community, into the scene, if you're just somebody who's got money and passion
[13:30.240 --> 13:34.300]  and you want to jump into it, open up a new weed business, you don't know people like
[13:34.300 --> 13:38.900]  me and you with clones and people out there in the industry who have cuts of old heirloom
[13:38.900 --> 13:41.340]  stuff so they just don't have access to it.
[13:41.340 --> 13:42.340]  They don't have it.
[13:42.340 --> 13:44.060]  So they've got to find some seeds.
[13:44.060 --> 13:47.140]  They've got to get some clones and just run it.
[13:47.140 --> 13:53.660]  Because if another dispensary has OG Kush, they're not going to give it to them because
[13:53.660 --> 13:57.260]  that's how they're going to dominate the market and the people that want OG Kush are going
[13:57.260 --> 13:58.740]  to go over there.
[13:58.740 --> 14:06.340]  So that's when cuts and seeds and plants all become kind of, that's when it becomes a huge
[14:06.340 --> 14:07.820]  commodity and more desirable.
[14:07.820 --> 14:09.780]  That's when clones become expensive.
[14:09.780 --> 14:14.420]  So now let's talk about just popping seeds.
[14:14.420 --> 14:18.900]  Popping a bunch of seeds is how they are going to find something that sets them apart.
[14:18.900 --> 14:23.340]  That's how I find strains and breeding projects and plants that set me apart.
[14:23.340 --> 14:26.540]  I pop a bunch of seeds and I find the champs in there.
[14:26.540 --> 14:27.540]  Everybody's got the clone.
[14:27.540 --> 14:28.540]  It's a clone.
[14:29.340 --> 14:30.340]  That guy's got it.
[14:30.340 --> 14:31.340]  That guy's got it.
[14:31.340 --> 14:32.340]  That commercial girl's got it.
[14:32.340 --> 14:33.340]  That girl's got it.
[14:33.340 --> 14:34.340]  Everybody has that clone.
[14:34.340 --> 14:38.500]  But if you grow from seed and you don't share the clone, your commercial facility could
[14:38.500 --> 14:44.940]  be the only one with that dark hollow cut that tests at 39% THC and just drips with
[14:44.940 --> 14:49.340]  turps and it trims itself and it puts on a green light when it's ready for harvest.
[14:49.340 --> 14:50.940]  You may find that one in the pack.
[14:50.940 --> 14:53.060]  If you find that plant, do send me a clone.
[14:53.060 --> 14:56.620]  But you've got to grow from seed to find that.
[14:56.700 --> 15:00.460]  Hopefully, and this is a good thing to talk about right now at this time of year.
[15:00.460 --> 15:03.180]  I did put out a similar episode to this last year.
[15:03.180 --> 15:05.620]  Here's something we can talk about.
[15:05.620 --> 15:09.380]  If you're going to run untested stuff, run small batches.
[15:09.380 --> 15:12.420]  Don't run big ass plants of untested genetics.
[15:12.420 --> 15:14.500]  Run a plant big enough to get a clone.
[15:14.500 --> 15:16.340]  Take a clone from that plant.
[15:16.340 --> 15:20.460]  Sex either the original plant that grew from seed or that clone.
[15:20.460 --> 15:23.860]  Just put it into 12-12 and flower it long enough for it to show you if it's a boy or
[15:23.860 --> 15:24.860]  a girl.
[15:24.860 --> 15:26.180]  If it's a boy, toss it.
[15:26.740 --> 15:28.140]  If it's an intersex plant, toss it.
[15:28.140 --> 15:30.900]  Unless, of course, you're looking for a breeding project and keep that boy.
[15:30.900 --> 15:33.300]  No matter what, toss the intersex plants.
[15:33.300 --> 15:37.860]  When you find the good females or when you find the females, grow those out to flower.
[15:37.860 --> 15:41.660]  Then dry them, cure them, and smoke them and find the females that are most desirable for
[15:41.660 --> 15:46.020]  your grow, for your customers, for your clientele, for your situation.
[15:46.020 --> 15:48.700]  And then continue with that phenotype.
[15:48.700 --> 15:50.980]  But the only way to do it is to grow from seed.
[15:50.980 --> 15:52.900]  But you should grow small tester batches.
[15:52.900 --> 15:56.820]  I see people putting giant plants outside.
[15:56.820 --> 15:59.740]  We're a couple weeks into the flowering season now in a few places.
[15:59.740 --> 16:02.100]  People have nine-foot tall male plants outside.
[16:02.100 --> 16:03.740]  They're going, what's wrong with this plant?
[16:03.740 --> 16:05.820]  I'm saying, that's a male plant.
[16:05.820 --> 16:09.860]  You're pollinating everything for miles around if you don't cut that down soon.
[16:09.860 --> 16:14.660]  Why did you spend months and months watering and taking care of a big-ass plant that we
[16:14.660 --> 16:19.820]  could have found out that was a male months ago and not wasted the time, energy, resources?
[16:19.820 --> 16:21.700]  A lot of places, it's illegal.
[16:21.700 --> 16:26.340]  They're up there growing an illegal plant, nurturing it, loving it, taking pictures,
[16:26.340 --> 16:29.460]  posing, taking selfies with it, and now they got to cut it down.
[16:29.460 --> 16:32.940]  And they were committing felonies, and they don't even have anything to show for it.
[16:32.940 --> 16:36.420]  Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[16:36.420 --> 16:38.460]  But so let me get back to the original question.
[16:38.460 --> 16:44.020]  How do you feel about commercial growers using autos and untested genetics?
[16:44.020 --> 16:47.740]  Autos is going to be an option for everybody.
[16:47.740 --> 16:51.100]  And autos are great if you get them from a reliable auto breeder.
[16:51.500 --> 16:53.180]  Big shout out to Mephisto Seeds.
[16:53.180 --> 16:54.220]  They don't pay me to say that.
[16:54.220 --> 16:57.020]  I believe those are quality seeds.
[16:57.020 --> 17:02.020]  So autos are always an option for everybody if that fits your needs.
[17:02.020 --> 17:04.460]  Then how do I feel about untested genetics?
[17:04.460 --> 17:06.500]  Run a small batch and test them.
[17:06.500 --> 17:10.580]  The way to do it is to have one of the growers, maybe the lead grower, grow the untested stuff
[17:10.580 --> 17:12.900]  at home if you've got the opportunity, the space.
[17:12.900 --> 17:17.260]  If things work like that for you, do all the testing in a small area at home, and then
[17:17.260 --> 17:18.980]  take that to the commercial grower later.
[17:18.980 --> 17:20.700]  Make it like a home project.
[17:21.300 --> 17:25.660]  Or dedicate some space to R&D because those untested genetics, maybe that's where you
[17:25.660 --> 17:26.860]  find the gems.
[17:26.860 --> 17:29.460]  You don't know if they're hot fire or if they're turds.
[17:29.460 --> 17:31.780]  You don't know what's in there yet because they're untested.
[17:31.780 --> 17:38.260]  So if you can dedicate just two 5x5 areas or four lights or three lights to just testing,
[17:38.260 --> 17:40.460]  you can find a lot of good shit in there.
[17:40.460 --> 17:43.460]  And you got to do something, man.
[17:43.460 --> 17:44.460]  Like a lot of people.
[17:44.460 --> 17:49.140]  So imagine if you were friends and you're a huge member of the Irie Army and part of
[17:49.140 --> 17:50.140]  the community.
[17:50.580 --> 17:53.300]  If you were just in the middle of America, I'm not even going to pick a state because
[17:53.300 --> 17:55.380]  then that state will start emailing me.
[17:55.380 --> 17:59.540]  You're just in a state that doesn't have medical or recreational cannabis.
[17:59.540 --> 18:03.940]  And then you see like, hey, in the next six months we're going to be opening dispensaries
[18:03.940 --> 18:04.940]  and commercial grows.
[18:04.940 --> 18:06.860]  And you're like, I really want to do that.
[18:06.860 --> 18:08.700]  And they're like, cool, here's all your licensing and stuff.
[18:08.700 --> 18:09.820]  Where are your plants coming from?
[18:09.820 --> 18:11.900]  You're going to go, I don't know.
[18:11.900 --> 18:13.640]  You're going to have to start with something.
[18:13.640 --> 18:15.500]  You're going to have to be resourceful.
[18:15.500 --> 18:19.300]  And you're going to have to do the best with what you've got until you can do better.
[18:19.460 --> 18:23.860]  So yeah, hopefully these dispensary grows that you're talking about are doing some pheno
[18:23.860 --> 18:27.540]  hunts and they're just putting out what they can while they've got it.
[18:27.540 --> 18:29.900]  Keep in mind, bro, this is a brand new industry.
[18:29.900 --> 18:32.300]  In a lot of places, this is brand new.
[18:32.300 --> 18:35.340]  The commercial grow, the dispensary, it was all just birthed.
[18:35.340 --> 18:38.420]  So it will only get better, hopefully.
[18:38.420 --> 18:41.360]  Sometimes corporate comes in, sometimes new rules and laws come in and kind of squish
[18:41.360 --> 18:42.360]  it a little bit.
[18:42.360 --> 18:47.380]  But it should just get better, especially with strain selections, especially as the
[18:47.380 --> 18:48.660]  industry grows.
[18:49.020 --> 18:50.820]  And then the competition settles down a little bit.
[18:50.820 --> 18:57.780]  Right now, it's just so much competition that no other grower, no other dispensary, no other
[18:57.780 --> 19:00.740]  cultivation facility is going to share elite cuts.
[19:00.740 --> 19:01.740]  That's what separates us.
[19:01.740 --> 19:03.020]  I said that before.
[19:03.020 --> 19:06.540]  If you had the magic spell that everybody wanted to buy, would you give the spell to
[19:06.540 --> 19:08.340]  somebody else so they could make part of the money too?
[19:08.340 --> 19:11.180]  Or are you just going to bring all the money into your business?
[19:11.180 --> 19:12.500]  That's just how it's always worked.
[19:12.500 --> 19:15.300]  That's why I've always encouraged pheno hunting through seeds.
[19:15.300 --> 19:20.180]  You can find that cultivar, that cut that is just amazing and nobody else ever around
[19:20.180 --> 19:22.900]  you has it because you found it in a pack of seeds.
[19:22.900 --> 19:23.900]  You didn't share it.
[19:23.900 --> 19:24.900]  Don't give a clone out.
[19:24.900 --> 19:28.460]  Eventually, an employee in the commercial facility will steal it and then it will get
[19:28.460 --> 19:29.460]  out.
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.460]  That's just how it always works.
[19:30.460 --> 19:32.740]  But if you don't share that thing, it'll be yours.
[19:32.740 --> 19:35.300]  It'll keep your facility rocking for years to come.
[19:35.300 --> 19:37.260]  So let me catch more of this message.
[19:37.260 --> 19:39.580]  There is more to it.
[19:39.580 --> 19:41.540]  Unless they're explaining they're working in the meantime.
[19:41.540 --> 19:43.820]  Yeah, they've got to do something, bro.
[19:43.820 --> 19:46.460]  You've got to run the best option until they get their shit up and running.
[19:46.460 --> 19:47.980]  And it always takes a while to dial it in.
[19:47.980 --> 19:49.180]  How was your first crop?
[19:49.180 --> 19:51.540]  How was your second and third crop?
[19:51.540 --> 19:53.740]  Imagine those crops at scale.
[19:53.740 --> 19:57.200]  I don't know how big the commercial grows you're looking at are.
[19:57.200 --> 20:01.300]  Commercial grows in my mind are at least 50 lights when you start saying 25 lights, maybe,
[20:01.300 --> 20:02.860]  but like 50 lights to 100.
[20:02.860 --> 20:04.820]  100 is a real commercial grow.
[20:04.820 --> 20:07.020]  That's a big boy grow in my mind.
[20:07.020 --> 20:12.860]  Imagine the first run in a brand new building with a commercial grow with a new lead cultivator,
[20:12.900 --> 20:18.100]  a new staff, new equipment, a new room, new lights.
[20:18.100 --> 20:19.100]  Everything is different.
[20:19.100 --> 20:22.180]  Your first crop, the only, and especially maybe new plants.
[20:22.180 --> 20:23.420]  You don't know any of this stuff.
[20:23.420 --> 20:24.420]  You haven't done it before.
[20:24.420 --> 20:25.900]  You've got, you know how to grow.
[20:25.900 --> 20:29.160]  You know how to turn on the lights, turn off the lights, water the plants, but everything
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.160]  is new.
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.860]  This is a whole new vehicle, a new fucking race, is a whole new game.
[20:33.860 --> 20:35.740]  So there's a lot of learning to be done.
[20:35.740 --> 20:39.620]  Give those grows, those growers, the opportunity to get their shit together.
[20:39.620 --> 20:42.460]  They're going to need two or three grows to fuck it up before they're going to get
[20:42.460 --> 20:43.460]  it right.
[20:43.460 --> 20:45.980]  And then they're going to get it right and they're going to get real cocky and think
[20:45.980 --> 20:48.820]  they figured it out and then the seasons are going to change and then they're going to
[20:48.820 --> 20:52.940]  screw up a couple of grows and have to learn how to grow every season differently.
[20:52.940 --> 20:54.460]  That's something they will overlook.
[20:54.460 --> 20:55.940]  All right.
[20:55.940 --> 20:56.940]  Then it goes on.
[20:56.940 --> 21:02.660]  It does say basically, what is your view on farmers running other people's cuts, genetics,
[21:02.660 --> 21:03.700]  autos?
[21:03.700 --> 21:06.260]  Everything is somebody else's cuts, genetics, autos.
[21:06.260 --> 21:09.900]  I don't think that the commercial farms should be out there breeding.
[21:09.900 --> 21:10.900]  That is my job.
[21:10.900 --> 21:15.660]  I breed, they get seeds, they find the stuff that works best for their growth.
[21:15.660 --> 21:18.180]  So they've got to run somebody else's stuff.
[21:18.180 --> 21:24.220]  There are commercial facilities out there that actually specialize in providing clones
[21:24.220 --> 21:25.500]  for the commercial market.
[21:25.500 --> 21:29.820]  They'll do the work for you, find stuff that produces well as powdery mildew resistant,
[21:29.820 --> 21:33.460]  bug resistant, puts out good lab tests, good bag appeal.
[21:33.460 --> 21:35.820]  They'll find shit and then they'll sell it to the commercial market.
[21:36.380 --> 21:37.900]  There are several facilities that do that.
[21:37.900 --> 21:40.900]  So the genetics have to come from somewhere, just like breeding.
[21:40.900 --> 21:44.300]  That's just like saying, do you think a breeder should work with somebody else's genetics?
[21:44.300 --> 21:47.020]  I can't just clap my hands and create new strains to work with.
[21:47.020 --> 21:49.460]  It's got to come from somewhere.
[21:49.460 --> 21:53.100]  Do you feel those farmers putting in time to find those strains are getting overlooked
[21:53.100 --> 21:57.100]  because another farmer took someone's word on a clone?
[21:57.100 --> 21:59.500]  The farmers doing the time get overlooked.
[21:59.500 --> 22:04.540]  No, the farmers doing the time don't get overlooked because they've got a clone that draws everybody
[22:04.540 --> 22:05.540]  to their grow.
[22:06.260 --> 22:07.260]  We had a rise.
[22:07.260 --> 22:09.420]  My cut of a rise was at a commercial facility.
[22:09.420 --> 22:12.020]  I would post, hey, we just harvested some arise.
[22:12.020 --> 22:14.020]  It's being transferred to the store tomorrow.
[22:14.020 --> 22:15.980]  It would sell out tomorrow.
[22:15.980 --> 22:17.340]  We're the only one that had it.
[22:17.340 --> 22:20.940]  So I don't think the farmers get overlooked.
[22:20.940 --> 22:25.420]  They knew it was coming from us and I definitely got my praise because another farmer took
[22:25.420 --> 22:27.860]  someone's word on a clone.
[22:27.860 --> 22:32.220]  Yeah, if they took someone's word on it, they should run it.
[22:32.220 --> 22:33.700]  Don't go running a thousand of them.
[22:33.700 --> 22:37.220]  You should always test everything and see if it's any good and then always let people
[22:37.220 --> 22:39.100]  know that's the this cut.
[22:39.100 --> 22:42.900]  That's the arise Rasta Jeff cut or whatever.
[22:42.900 --> 22:46.260]  I don't know if I completely understand that part of the question, but then it does go
[22:46.260 --> 22:47.260]  on.
[22:47.260 --> 22:50.260]  It says, I think it's a great strategy for getting started, but I do feel that the end
[22:50.260 --> 22:54.140]  goal for me as a farmer would be breeding two of my own strains together to create my
[22:54.140 --> 22:56.340]  magnum opus, if you will.
[22:56.340 --> 23:03.420]  Yes, that would be the ideal goal, but in a commercial environment right now, the price
[23:03.420 --> 23:09.180]  and cost of cannabis in Colorado has dropped dramatically right now in a new market.
[23:09.180 --> 23:10.180]  I know where you are.
[23:10.180 --> 23:12.380]  Herb is worth a lot of money.
[23:12.380 --> 23:13.380]  Stack some of that money up.
[23:13.380 --> 23:17.580]  If you work with the new facility, if you're fucking doing something in that business,
[23:17.580 --> 23:21.280]  stack that money up because it's not always going to be that way.
[23:21.280 --> 23:22.660]  New regulations will come.
[23:22.660 --> 23:24.620]  That's going to cut out part of your income.
[23:24.620 --> 23:25.900]  You're going to need new regulations.
[23:25.900 --> 23:26.900]  You'll need more employees.
[23:26.900 --> 23:29.980]  They're going to add more packaging requirements.
[23:29.980 --> 23:32.900]  All this stuff is going to start cutting out of your income.
[23:33.380 --> 23:35.940]  As the market regulates, the price will drop.
[23:35.940 --> 23:37.740]  It's going to get very competitive.
[23:37.740 --> 23:40.700]  You're going to get people supplying more product than people will buy.
[23:40.700 --> 23:41.940]  There'll be outdoor grows.
[23:41.940 --> 23:43.980]  There'll be a lot of indoor grows.
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.900]  People are going to get good at it.
[23:45.900 --> 23:48.140]  Prices will drop.
[23:48.140 --> 23:53.700]  What I'm getting at is they have to sell every single gram that they can produce.
[23:53.700 --> 23:58.740]  My goal, when I do consulting for facilities, my goal is to go in and figure out how to
[23:58.740 --> 24:02.620]  maximize production and minimize costs.
[24:03.340 --> 24:04.900]  You've got to spend less and produce more.
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.820]  My job is to figure out how to do it.
[24:06.820 --> 24:08.980]  I basically go in and find leaks.
[24:08.980 --> 24:10.700]  Where are we fucking hemorrhaging money?
[24:10.700 --> 24:14.780]  Where can we put some patches and save a few bucks here and a few bucks there, produce
[24:14.780 --> 24:17.500]  better quality and more of it?
[24:17.500 --> 24:23.320]  What I'm getting at is they don't have the room, space, time, money, employees, manpower.
[24:23.320 --> 24:28.300]  They don't have the money, the funding to spend a room on creating new strains.
[24:28.300 --> 24:32.220]  There are some places that have tried to do that and may be doing that, but it's very
[24:32.220 --> 24:38.540]  uncommon because in this market right now, every, not every gram, every half gram of
[24:38.540 --> 24:41.540]  flour counts right now to pay the bills.
[24:41.540 --> 24:44.860]  A pound of weed costs so much to produce.
[24:44.860 --> 24:48.780]  Then when you sell a pound of weed to a market, it doesn't make a lot of profit.
[24:48.780 --> 24:51.860]  There is not a lot of profit per pound right now.
[24:51.860 --> 24:57.100]  You've got to pay for, if it's vertically integrated, you've got to pay for multiple
[24:57.100 --> 24:58.100]  buildings.
[24:58.900 --> 25:00.420]  You've got the commercial facility where you're producing it.
[25:00.420 --> 25:05.420]  You've got the facility where you are turning it into edibles or topicals or whatever it's
[25:05.420 --> 25:06.500]  being turned into.
[25:06.500 --> 25:09.220]  Then you've got the dispensary where it is being distributed.
[25:09.220 --> 25:11.000]  You're paying rent for three facilities.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.500]  You're paying three licenses.
[25:12.500 --> 25:14.260]  You're paying three staffs.
[25:14.260 --> 25:17.860]  There's a manager, a supervisor, or whatever you want to call it at each facility.
[25:17.860 --> 25:24.100]  If it's the extraction facility, the edible facility, the topical facility, that's three
[25:24.100 --> 25:25.100]  managers.
[25:25.100 --> 25:26.940]  There's a cultivation manager, maybe two.
[25:26.940 --> 25:28.380]  There's a dispensary manager.
[25:28.380 --> 25:31.740]  Then there's a compliance manager who goes to all of those and makes sure you're following
[25:31.740 --> 25:32.740]  the rules.
[25:32.740 --> 25:33.740]  Then there's a lawyer.
[25:33.740 --> 25:34.740]  Then there's an accountant.
[25:34.740 --> 25:36.620]  Then there's a payroll person.
[25:36.620 --> 25:41.380]  There are so many people to pay is what I'm trying to say that there's no profit right
[25:41.380 --> 25:43.860]  now in legal cannabis in Colorado.
[25:43.860 --> 25:48.620]  It's very, very, very low margins is what I'm trying to say.
[25:48.620 --> 25:53.940]  At this time, there's no room, no space, no desire to breed seeds in a commercial facility.
[25:53.940 --> 25:59.020]  That's got to be done by guys like myself who are not relying on every gram to pay the
[25:59.020 --> 26:04.820]  light bill because I don't have a trim crew of nine people who if my business closes,
[26:04.820 --> 26:10.260]  the lead cultivator, the consultants, who's the person, the compliance manager, the trim
[26:10.260 --> 26:14.100]  crew, the metric person, all those people don't lose their job.
[26:14.100 --> 26:16.020]  It's a lot different to think about.
[26:16.020 --> 26:17.640]  I should be doing the breeding.
[26:17.640 --> 26:23.480]  Those places should be producing just mass quantities of the best herb that they can.
[26:24.020 --> 26:29.400]  I do appreciate and enjoy and admire your goal of breeding two strains together to create
[26:29.400 --> 26:33.960]  your magnum opus, but you'll understand quickly that that's going to take you years.
[26:33.960 --> 26:36.360]  It's going to take a very, very long time.
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.280]  When I was working in commercial facilities, sometimes they would afford me the opportunity
[26:41.280 --> 26:44.880]  and bless me with a little bit of space to run one or two lights of seeds and do some
[26:44.880 --> 26:46.280]  hunting in there.
[26:46.280 --> 26:49.600]  Then the idea was that they would get to keep the winner and I would get to use their facility
[26:49.600 --> 26:51.480]  for research.
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.520]  We'd run a hundred seeds and then in the end we'd pick one keeper out of that batch of
[26:55.520 --> 26:56.520]  a hundred.
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.320]  I would get to take photos and notes and do a hundred seeds under their grow.
[27:00.320 --> 27:03.320]  I would have a staff running it on the weekend so other people could mess with it.
[27:03.320 --> 27:05.440]  I could take the weekends off and do a normal life.
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.240]  Then at the end I got all the data, all the reports, all the photos, and they got to keep
[27:10.240 --> 27:11.240]  the winner.
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.160]  Then quite often I would end up with the clone of that winner plant as well.
[27:15.160 --> 27:19.800]  It does take a lot of time and a lot of work to breed, especially in a cultivation facility.
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.560]  How are you not going to pollinate everything?
[27:22.560 --> 27:25.720]  If you're trying to make a cross in there, you've got a male plant in your commercial
[27:25.720 --> 27:30.440]  facility, that's that much time that you can't flower without pollinating something if you're
[27:30.440 --> 27:31.440]  not careful.
[27:31.440 --> 27:33.840]  That does make a struggle.
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.120]  It does say I don't know exactly where I was going with this, but maybe this will be a
[27:37.120 --> 27:38.120]  good topic.
[27:38.120 --> 27:40.880]  You could give me more insight how it is in Colorado.
[27:40.880 --> 27:44.680]  I think I did ramble and bring this into Colorado as well.
[27:44.680 --> 27:45.680]  That was a great topic.
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.680]  As I'm thinking about visiting Colorado when I have some extra funds, I'd love to say,
[27:49.680 --> 27:52.280]  hello, if I pass through your area.
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.200]  I would almost be offended if you don't say hello and if you don't pass through my area.
[27:57.200 --> 27:58.440]  Come by, say what's up.
[27:58.440 --> 27:59.440]  Would love to meet you.
[27:59.440 --> 28:00.960]  Shake your hand, say what's up.
[28:00.960 --> 28:04.680]  Give you a fist bump, dab you out, get you so high you're uncomfortable.
[28:04.680 --> 28:06.240]  That is all I've got for this episode.
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.720]  The battery meter on this camera just turned red, so I better hurry up and wrap this shit
[28:10.720 --> 28:11.720]  up.
[28:11.720 --> 28:15.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pamps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.400]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I want to
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.240]  thank you again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[28:55.100 --> 28:56.100]  Please help me out.
[28:56.100 --> 28:58.920]  I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.

[28:59.960 --> 29:01.160]  Thanks again for listening.

[29:04.120 --> 29:07.440]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, John Boy Grows.
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.080]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
