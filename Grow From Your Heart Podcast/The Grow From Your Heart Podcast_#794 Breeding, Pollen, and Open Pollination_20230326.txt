[00:01.150 --> 00:22.710]  Welcome back to the show podcast world.
[00:22.710 --> 00:24.210]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[00:24.210 --> 00:28.350]  This is episode 794 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:28.350 --> 00:30.250]  I've got a great show lined up for us.
[00:30.250 --> 00:33.170]  In this episode, I'm going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:33.170 --> 00:37.670]  I've teamed up with our friends at seeds here now.com to give away a free pack of irigenetic
[00:37.670 --> 00:38.670]  seeds.
[00:38.670 --> 00:40.490]  We'll do that later in this episode.
[00:40.490 --> 00:44.410]  Before we get too far, I do want to remind you that irigenetics will be at the dude grows
[00:44.410 --> 00:45.410]  cup.
[00:45.410 --> 00:48.550]  I think that the dude grows cup is happening again this year, just outside of Fort Collins
[00:48.550 --> 00:49.830]  on June 3rd.
[00:49.830 --> 00:53.930]  Make sure to check out dgccup.com for all of the information.
[00:53.930 --> 01:00.050]  Also there will be a fresh drop and a restock and new items on iRedirect on April 1st.
[01:00.050 --> 01:01.050]  That's right.
[01:01.050 --> 01:05.070]  Make sure you check out iRedirect on April 1st for a brand new restock, fresh drops,
[01:05.070 --> 01:08.030]  new items, and of course a fat sale prize.
[01:08.030 --> 01:09.030]  All right.
[01:09.030 --> 01:11.790]  I think that's all the business we've got to cover here at the start of the show.
[01:11.790 --> 01:13.710]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[01:13.710 --> 01:16.450]  Let's jump into the grow help part of this podcast.
[01:16.450 --> 01:18.090]  There is a grow help tab on my website.
[01:18.090 --> 01:21.770]  If you go to irigenetics.com, on the top there are several tabs.
[01:21.770 --> 01:23.610]  One of them says grow questions.
[01:23.610 --> 01:25.270]  Click on there, send me your grow question.
[01:25.270 --> 01:29.470]  If I read your grow question on the podcast, you will win a free pack of seeds.
[01:29.470 --> 01:34.950]  The first question on today's show came from our friend who wants to be called Johnny Pottsmoker.
[01:34.950 --> 01:38.570]  Big congrats to my friend Johnny Pottsmoker because you have won a free pack of seeds
[01:38.570 --> 01:39.890]  for sending me this question.
[01:39.890 --> 01:42.110]  This question goes a little bit like this.
[01:42.110 --> 01:45.610]  It says, hey Ross to Jeff, thank you for taking time to read this grow question.
[01:45.610 --> 01:48.650]  Hey bro, thank you for taking the time to send this grow question.
[01:48.650 --> 01:49.650]  It goes on.
[01:49.650 --> 01:52.930]  It says, can I start breeding with just feminized seeds?
[01:52.930 --> 01:56.250]  That is a really good question, a very common question I get a lot.
[01:56.250 --> 02:01.010]  It says, I want to look into starting a breeding project in my two by four tent.
[02:01.010 --> 02:04.970]  My issue is that my five by five tent shares the same lung room.
[02:04.970 --> 02:06.330]  Should I even risk it?
[02:06.330 --> 02:10.330]  Follow up question, can I take feminized reverse pollen and cross it with an auto flower?
[02:10.330 --> 02:11.330]  What would happen?
[02:11.550 --> 02:13.670]  Happy growing from our friend Johnny Pottsmoker.
[02:13.670 --> 02:15.870]  This is a good series of questions here.
[02:15.870 --> 02:16.990]  Let's jump right into this.
[02:16.990 --> 02:20.790]  You absolutely can breed with just feminized seeds.
[02:20.790 --> 02:22.630]  That is the first part of this.
[02:22.630 --> 02:24.830]  You can use fem seeds for your breeding project.
[02:24.830 --> 02:26.670]  However, there will not be a male in there.
[02:26.670 --> 02:29.790]  If you've got feminized seeds, all of those will be girls.
[02:29.790 --> 02:34.110]  You will have to select one of those and reverse it to use that as your pollen donor or of
[02:34.110 --> 02:38.270]  course use non-feminized seeds to find a boy to breed with that plant.
[02:38.770 --> 02:42.810]  Feminized seeds work just like non-feminized seeds other than the fact that you're not
[02:42.810 --> 02:45.850]  going to get any males out of that mix.
[02:45.850 --> 02:50.470]  Some people have a myth or an idea or a misconception that they cannot breed to a plant that came
[02:50.470 --> 02:51.770]  from a fem seed.
[02:51.770 --> 02:54.610]  In my experience, those plants are great.
[02:54.610 --> 02:59.090]  Let's talk about the, I've bred the lemon Jeffrey, which is one of my favorite cuts.
[02:59.090 --> 03:00.090]  That is a feminized plant.
[03:00.090 --> 03:01.170]  I created that.
[03:01.170 --> 03:03.690]  I have bred that to several other things.
[03:03.690 --> 03:06.550]  The lemon sunrise is lemon Jeffrey to a rise.
[03:06.550 --> 03:07.550]  Those are great plants.
[03:07.570 --> 03:11.650]  It brings out a lot of traits from the arise, a lot of traits from the lemon Jeffrey.
[03:11.650 --> 03:14.330]  That's a feminized to a regular and it works very well.
[03:14.330 --> 03:19.730]  You absolutely can work your fems into the breeding program any way that you see fit.
[03:19.730 --> 03:22.490]  The next part of the question, should I risk it?
[03:22.490 --> 03:27.570]  Because my five by five room and my two by four share the same lung room.
[03:27.570 --> 03:31.330]  With that lung room being the commonality there, I do not think I would risk it because
[03:31.330 --> 03:35.150]  the pollen will get into the air and it will end up in both of those grow rooms.
[03:35.150 --> 03:37.670]  The room you want seated will be fully seated.
[03:37.670 --> 03:41.710]  The room you don't want seated will have too many seeds in it just because there's no barrier.
[03:41.710 --> 03:44.030]  There's no, there's absolutely no protection.
[03:44.030 --> 03:47.550]  That lung room is what is going to move the pollen from one place to another.
[03:47.550 --> 03:49.110]  The pollen is very fine.
[03:49.110 --> 03:53.230]  I would recommend doing it a little bit further away, which we will touch on on another question
[03:53.230 --> 03:54.810]  here in this episode.
[03:54.810 --> 03:59.190]  So in your setup, no, I would not even risk it because that lung room is just going to
[03:59.190 --> 04:01.510]  move that pollen right around.
[04:01.510 --> 04:02.850]  Everybody is going to be pollinated.
[04:02.850 --> 04:09.570]  So maybe you can learn how to do the five by five room, put it into flower, get it flowered,
[04:09.570 --> 04:12.470]  get it almost done, and then put the other room into flower.
[04:12.470 --> 04:15.870]  That way the next time you fill the five by five, it's only in veg and then you can do
[04:15.870 --> 04:20.610]  your seed breeding in the other room, have that side flowering while they're vegging,
[04:20.610 --> 04:24.410]  then get that done, clean up all the pollen before these plants go into flower.
[04:24.410 --> 04:28.610]  That should work out for you, but you can't do both at the same time because I do fear
[04:28.610 --> 04:31.050]  that you will pollinate that entire room.
[04:31.050 --> 04:32.410]  Here's the third part to the question.
[04:32.410 --> 04:37.450]  It says, my follow-up question, can I take feminized reversed pollen and cross it with
[04:37.450 --> 04:38.450]  an auto flower?
[04:38.450 --> 04:40.090]  You absolutely can.
[04:40.090 --> 04:41.710]  What would happen then?
[04:41.710 --> 04:47.570]  You're going to make feminized plants that show some traits of auto flower and some traits
[04:47.570 --> 04:50.010]  that show regular photo period plants.
[04:50.010 --> 04:53.730]  If this is the first time you're crossing it to that auto flower, there will be a percentage.
[04:53.730 --> 04:58.830]  I'm not an auto flower breeder, but there will be a percentage of those plants that
[04:58.830 --> 05:00.690]  do come out auto flower.
[05:00.830 --> 05:04.390]  If you're okay with having some of your offspring be auto flower, some of your offspring be
[05:04.390 --> 05:07.590]  regular photo period, that is an acceptable idea.
[05:07.590 --> 05:11.730]  The next step would be to cross that auto flower to another auto flower again in the
[05:11.730 --> 05:16.230]  future to lock in that auto flower trait if that's the route that you want to go.
[05:16.230 --> 05:20.690]  Only use auto flower if your main goal is to make auto flower plants because that's
[05:20.690 --> 05:22.810]  what you're introducing into the gene pool.
[05:22.810 --> 05:24.410]  The short answer is yes, you can do this.
[05:24.410 --> 05:29.130]  The long answer is only do that if you intend on working that auto flower trait in and making
[05:29.170 --> 05:33.730]  that a stable trait that pops up amongst the population.
[05:33.730 --> 05:36.090]  Question number one, you can breed with fem seeds.
[05:36.090 --> 05:38.170]  They are just like regular seeds.
[05:38.170 --> 05:42.610]  I would not do it in the room with two tents because you're going to get contamination.
[05:42.610 --> 05:44.210]  Yes, you can breed.
[05:44.210 --> 05:48.970]  You can use feminized reversed pollen to an auto flower and it will make some plants that
[05:48.970 --> 05:52.050]  are autos, some plants that are regs.
[05:52.050 --> 05:54.930]  My buddy, Johnny Pottsmoker, thank you for the great series of questions.
[05:54.930 --> 05:56.290]  I hope I answered your questions well.
[05:56.290 --> 05:57.770]  I hope I helped you out.
[05:57.770 --> 06:02.970]  Please do send me your address so I can send you a free pack of Irie Genetic Seeds.
[06:02.970 --> 06:07.650]  Of course, that seed giveaway is sponsored by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[06:07.650 --> 06:09.350]  Shout out to my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[06:09.350 --> 06:15.610]  If you need regular feminized or auto flower seeds, I definitely recommend seedsherenow.com.
[06:15.610 --> 06:17.610]  We're going to keep moving forward.
[06:17.610 --> 06:22.090]  This message also came from the grow help tab on iregenetics.com.
[06:22.090 --> 06:24.970]  This one came from our friend who wants to be called Shiggy Smacks.
[06:24.970 --> 06:27.290]  Big shout out to my new friend, Shiggy Smacks.
[06:27.290 --> 06:31.690]  Before I get too far, Shiggy, please do send me your address so that I can mail you a free
[06:31.690 --> 06:33.290]  pack of Irie Genetic Seeds.
[06:33.290 --> 06:38.490]  If I read your message here on the podcast, you do win free beans, so I owe you a pack.
[06:38.490 --> 06:39.490]  Here goes the question.
[06:39.490 --> 06:42.730]  It says, let's say we take a female out of the flower tent.
[06:42.730 --> 06:44.370]  All right, pulled her out of the tent.
[06:44.370 --> 06:49.290]  Then we put it in a small separate tent real, real far, far away and pollinate it with the
[06:49.290 --> 06:50.670]  super dope studs.
[06:50.670 --> 06:52.570]  So far, this is making sense.
[06:52.570 --> 06:57.290]  Now the question is, can I take that female after I know it's been pollinated, maybe just
[06:57.290 --> 07:01.810]  blow it off a bit, stick it back in the flower tent and expect everything to be just peachy
[07:01.810 --> 07:08.610]  or will residual pollen be left on the plant and that pollen fertilize the other females?
[07:08.610 --> 07:12.450]  That is a very good question.
[07:12.450 --> 07:16.090]  If this is done correctly, it will work the way that you want it to.
[07:16.090 --> 07:19.570]  But keep in mind that pollen is microscopic.
[07:19.570 --> 07:24.290]  The pollen that got on that plant got in your hair, in your clothes, in your dreadlocks.
[07:24.290 --> 07:28.290]  If you got dreadlocks, it's in your eyelashes, it's in your eyebrows, it's in your hoodie,
[07:28.290 --> 07:29.370]  it's everywhere.
[07:29.370 --> 07:34.630]  So we've got to get rid of that pollen before we return to the sensimilla room with no seeds
[07:34.630 --> 07:35.630]  in it.
[07:35.630 --> 07:39.690]  So the main way that I would recommend doing that, the main key to deactivating pollen
[07:39.690 --> 07:41.010]  is water.
[07:41.010 --> 07:42.270]  Water deactivates pollen.
[07:42.270 --> 07:46.410]  So I would pollinate that plant in that other room, leave it there for a couple of days.
[07:46.410 --> 07:47.410]  I pollinate twice.
[07:47.410 --> 07:49.090]  I just like to hit the plant two times.
[07:49.090 --> 07:52.930]  It just ensures that I'm going to get full pollination, lots of seeds.
[07:52.930 --> 07:54.450]  So I would do my pollination process.
[07:54.450 --> 07:56.330]  However you do that, however I do it.
[07:56.330 --> 07:58.810]  Put the plant, you said far, far away.
[07:58.810 --> 08:00.010]  Real real far, far away.
[08:00.010 --> 08:01.770]  We got two reals and two fars.
[08:01.770 --> 08:03.370]  So we're real, real far, far away.
[08:03.370 --> 08:05.010]  We're going to put the female in there.
[08:05.010 --> 08:06.290]  We're going to pollinate.
[08:06.290 --> 08:07.330]  I would wait a couple of days.
[08:07.330 --> 08:08.330]  I would pollinate again.
[08:08.330 --> 08:10.050]  Then I would wait a couple of days.
[08:10.050 --> 08:11.850]  Then like you said, blow off all that pollen.
[08:11.850 --> 08:14.210]  If you've got a way to dust off all that pollen, that is ideal.
[08:14.210 --> 08:15.570]  Get rid of that.
[08:15.570 --> 08:20.410]  Then I would take a bottle of just water and mist my plant with water completely.
[08:20.410 --> 08:24.130]  I would almost drench that plant to where it's running off.
[08:24.130 --> 08:28.210]  That water is going to deactivate and kill any of the pollen that is left on the plant,
[08:28.210 --> 08:31.090]  but it will not damage our seeds or the plant.
[08:31.090 --> 08:33.570]  Cannabis plants are designed by nature to be outside.
[08:33.570 --> 08:38.050]  Part of the trichome's purpose is to protect that plant from rain and moisture and water.
[08:38.050 --> 08:40.770]  The plant will be just fine if you drench it down one time.
[08:40.770 --> 08:45.210]  Don't leave it locked in a room and get stagnant with no air, but let's spray it down one time.
[08:45.850 --> 08:48.570]  That will help deactivate the pollen and you won't get any mold.
[08:48.570 --> 08:49.850]  You won't get any problems.
[08:49.850 --> 08:54.330]  Then when you're ready to move that plant after it's been sprayed down, also spray yourself
[08:54.330 --> 08:55.330]  down.
[08:55.330 --> 08:56.330]  Change your clothes.
[08:56.330 --> 08:59.410]  If you've got dreadlocks like I do, wrap them up when you're doing this or water them down.
[08:59.410 --> 09:00.410]  Spray them.
[09:00.410 --> 09:04.090]  Make sure you be very careful because pollen is microscopic and every little granule of
[09:04.090 --> 09:06.730]  pollen can equal one seed in the flower room.
[09:06.730 --> 09:07.730]  Be very careful.
[09:07.730 --> 09:09.930]  We've watered down the plant.
[09:09.930 --> 09:10.930]  Spray down everything.
[09:10.930 --> 09:11.930]  Wipe down the pot.
[09:11.930 --> 09:14.690]  Wipe down everything that was in the room with the pollen, including yourself.
[09:14.690 --> 09:15.690]  Take a shower.
[09:15.690 --> 09:16.690]  Scrub down.
[09:16.690 --> 09:17.690]  Get all that pollen off of you.
[09:17.690 --> 09:21.690]  Now at this time, when I'm taking that female plant into the general population with the
[09:21.690 --> 09:26.330]  other females, I would go in that room and I would also spray down all of those females.
[09:26.330 --> 09:28.550]  Just give them one good dusting with water.
[09:28.550 --> 09:32.290]  That way they're not able to receive any stray pollen that may be in the room.
[09:32.290 --> 09:35.810]  Then just go in there and move that plant in there and just do just a random willy nilly
[09:35.810 --> 09:36.810]  spray.
[09:36.810 --> 09:37.810]  Just coat everything with water.
[09:37.810 --> 09:40.930]  That way if there is any pollen that made it in there that is floating around, we've
[09:40.930 --> 09:42.210]  sprayed it once in this room.
[09:42.210 --> 09:43.210]  We've treated ourselves.
[09:43.210 --> 09:44.210]  We've brought it to the room.
[09:44.730 --> 09:45.730]  We've treated the females.
[09:45.730 --> 09:46.890]  Now we're treating everything in the room.
[09:46.890 --> 09:50.690]  Let's just triple check and make sure no pollen gets into the room.
[09:50.690 --> 09:56.330]  If you do this correctly, everything should be peachy like you said, but the residual
[09:56.330 --> 10:01.530]  pollen that could be left over will pollinate all of the pistils that it comes in contact
[10:01.530 --> 10:02.530]  with.
[10:02.530 --> 10:06.570]  Make sure that you do get every bit of pollen either off of that plant and or deactivated.
[10:06.570 --> 10:10.090]  I don't trust ... I've seen people take an air compressor and just blow the pollen off.
[10:10.090 --> 10:11.090]  I don't trust that.
[10:11.090 --> 10:13.650]  I don't, for some reason, I don't think that's good enough.
[10:13.650 --> 10:16.610]  I want some water in the mix as well.
[10:16.610 --> 10:17.830]  Get some water in there.
[10:17.830 --> 10:18.930]  Spray those plants down.
[10:18.930 --> 10:23.370]  Water is the deactivator of pollen that should rescue you.
[10:23.370 --> 10:27.090]  I don't want to be responsible if you try this and it does not go wrong.
[10:27.090 --> 10:29.450]  I'm telling you, pollen is crazy.
[10:29.450 --> 10:30.690]  Pollen travels in the air.
[10:30.690 --> 10:34.250]  Pollen will get stuck in your nose and then you'll sneeze it back out later.
[10:34.250 --> 10:36.530]  Pollen is microscopic, so keep that in mind.
[10:36.530 --> 10:38.570]  It moves very freely through the air.
[10:38.570 --> 10:42.090]  If you dust a plant, if you shake a plant making pollen, watch how that pollen just
[10:42.090 --> 10:43.090]  lingers in the air.
[10:43.090 --> 10:45.530]  Some of the smaller pieces will just stick around in there.
[10:45.530 --> 10:49.490]  They'll be there for a long time, much longer than you anticipate.
[10:49.490 --> 10:50.490]  Take good care of the pollen.
[10:50.490 --> 10:51.850]  Be really careful.
[10:51.850 --> 10:56.930]  It should be peachy, but it is very possible that you will pollinate the entire fucking
[10:56.930 --> 10:58.790]  room, so be very careful.
[10:58.790 --> 11:01.450]  My friend Shiggy Smacks, thank you for the great question.
[11:01.450 --> 11:06.530]  Please do send me your address because I owe you a free pack of seeds.
[11:06.530 --> 11:07.530]  Let's keep the show moving.
[11:07.530 --> 11:08.930]  I do have another question here in front of me.
[11:08.930 --> 11:11.210]  This one came from our friend Midget Dog.
[11:11.210 --> 11:12.210]  That's a really cool name.
[11:12.330 --> 11:13.930]  Shout out to my friend Midget Dog.
[11:13.930 --> 11:18.530]  Midget Dog, please make sure to send me your address because I do owe you a pack of iRegenetic
[11:18.530 --> 11:19.530]  seeds.
[11:19.530 --> 11:22.370]  Of course, those seeds are sponsored by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[11:22.370 --> 11:26.570]  Big thanks to them for hosting and promoting and sponsoring a seed giveaway here on the
[11:26.570 --> 11:27.610]  show.
[11:27.610 --> 11:30.610]  This question says, I have a general grow question.
[11:30.610 --> 11:35.450]  My plan is to grow a pack of Jack Tripper and do an open pollination with all of the
[11:35.450 --> 11:37.170]  plants, no individual selection.
[11:37.170 --> 11:39.690]  And then it says, I know I won't know the baby daddy.
[11:39.690 --> 11:40.690]  That's fine.
[11:40.690 --> 11:44.490]  If you're looking for an open pollination to make F2s, that's a great way to do it.
[11:44.490 --> 11:48.050]  You're going to make a lot of seeds and you're going to see a lot of diversity here.
[11:48.050 --> 11:52.530]  You're going to see all the phenotypical expressions and you will find what you want in that F2
[11:52.530 --> 11:53.770]  population by doing this.
[11:53.770 --> 11:57.650]  It says, I want to know individual selection.
[11:57.650 --> 12:01.890]  Then hunt the highest potency of the female to find high potency male to further breed
[12:01.890 --> 12:02.890]  with.
[12:02.890 --> 12:07.090]  That's a really good strategy, but don't get too hung up on the idea that potency is the
[12:07.090 --> 12:09.130]  only thing you're looking for.
[12:09.130 --> 12:10.130]  We need structure.
[12:10.570 --> 12:11.570]  We need plant vigor.
[12:11.570 --> 12:12.930]  We need resistance to pathogens.
[12:12.930 --> 12:15.530]  We need resistance to any kind of bugs.
[12:15.530 --> 12:19.210]  We also need to make sure that there's no intersex problem in these plants.
[12:19.210 --> 12:21.610]  So don't stay too focused on just potency.
[12:21.610 --> 12:24.890]  There are a lot of other factors that should help you determine if this plant is worth
[12:24.890 --> 12:25.890]  growing.
[12:25.890 --> 12:27.250]  Let's continue though.
[12:27.250 --> 12:32.530]  So the question I have is, have you ever seen intersex traits on a female after it has received
[12:32.530 --> 12:33.530]  pollen?
[12:33.530 --> 12:39.150]  No, I've never seen a plant that has received pollen show me intersex traits.
[12:39.170 --> 12:43.230]  But most of the time when I'm working with plants, I've grown them multiple times before
[12:43.230 --> 12:44.430]  I choose to breed with them.
[12:44.430 --> 12:49.270]  So I know that that intersex is not going to pop up before or after pollination.
[12:49.270 --> 12:52.670]  So there's a little bit of a vetting process to be done before I generally breed.
[12:52.670 --> 12:55.990]  It sounds like you're going to take these jack trippers and just go for it, which sounds
[12:55.990 --> 12:56.990]  like a fun project.
[12:56.990 --> 13:00.150]  I have no, you won't see intersex traits in those jack trippers.
[13:00.150 --> 13:01.510]  I've never seen that.
[13:01.510 --> 13:05.190]  Nobody out there has ever reported an intersex problem with the jack trippers.
[13:05.190 --> 13:06.190]  So I recommend you do it.
[13:06.190 --> 13:10.270]  You won't see any intersex traits pop up in there, but we'll stick with the question.
[13:10.270 --> 13:14.270]  Have you ever seen intersex traits on a female after it has received pollen?
[13:14.270 --> 13:16.510]  No, I've never seen that before.
[13:16.510 --> 13:18.150]  Or is that more common in scentsy bud?
[13:18.150 --> 13:21.030]  Yes, that is totally more common in scentsy bud.
[13:21.030 --> 13:22.270]  Something happens with the hormones.
[13:22.270 --> 13:26.230]  Once that plant has been pollinated, it's very unlikely to show intersex traits.
[13:26.230 --> 13:28.870]  In my experience, that's my opinion.
[13:28.870 --> 13:29.870]  That's what I think.
[13:29.870 --> 13:31.790]  I don't know if I have any science behind that.
[13:31.790 --> 13:36.150]  It says, I am just planning to do the F2, then select a male.
[13:36.150 --> 13:39.510]  I figured if I did it this way, I'm kind of mixing up the breeding pot a little.
[13:39.510 --> 13:42.750]  Bro, you are shaking the breeding lottery.
[13:42.750 --> 13:46.910]  You're getting everything that you could possibly pull, every phenotype imaginable, because you're
[13:46.910 --> 13:49.870]  not going to call any phenotypes either male or female.
[13:49.870 --> 13:54.270]  So you've got the tall, skinny one, the short, squatty one, the one that smells like lemons,
[13:54.270 --> 13:58.030]  the one that smells like dryer sheets, the one that smells a little bit like piss, the
[13:58.030 --> 14:01.370]  one that smells like lavender, the one that is real tall and skinny, the one that's super
[14:01.370 --> 14:02.370]  high potency.
[14:02.490 --> 14:06.570]  You're going to find all of those phenotypes, maybe different combinations of those phenotypes
[14:06.570 --> 14:09.570]  by mixing up that open pollination.
[14:09.570 --> 14:11.530]  Should we talk about open pollination for a second?
[14:11.530 --> 14:12.530]  We will.
[14:12.530 --> 14:13.530]  Let me keep going.
[14:13.530 --> 14:14.530]  So he does go on.
[14:14.530 --> 14:18.810]  He says, by adding in the Pandora's box of F2, I hope to find a jack tripper F2 male
[14:18.810 --> 14:21.130]  that carries on a rocket ship potency.
[14:21.130 --> 14:22.650]  Yes, that is a really good idea.
[14:22.650 --> 14:24.890]  And then he says, I'm two years out, ladies first.
[14:24.890 --> 14:27.650]  So he's going to pheno hunt the ladies first, which sounds like a really good idea.
[14:27.650 --> 14:31.650]  He's going to do the open pollination, grow some, find the ladies, then look for a male
[14:31.810 --> 14:32.810]  with that rocket potency.
[14:32.810 --> 14:33.930]  That is a good strategy.
[14:33.930 --> 14:34.930]  I like this idea.
[14:34.930 --> 14:36.250]  This is going to be fun.
[14:36.250 --> 14:39.210]  When you're ready, bro, I'd love to run a 10, maybe a 20 pack of these.
[14:39.210 --> 14:42.530]  I'm in Colorado, so I will run 12 of them because that is my legal limit.
[14:42.530 --> 14:44.430]  But I would love to run a few of these.
[14:44.430 --> 14:46.410]  See what you've F2'd from my creation.
[14:46.410 --> 14:50.170]  That's always fun to see, especially because now let's talk about, I said open pollination.
[14:50.170 --> 14:53.970]  I usually do not practice the open pollination sort of technique.
[14:53.970 --> 14:56.610]  I'm a very selective type of breeder.
[14:56.610 --> 14:59.210]  Open pollination, I may have kind of touched on it a moment ago.
[14:59.210 --> 15:03.610]  That is when this person is going to put an entire pack of Jack Tripper seeds in a
[15:03.610 --> 15:08.650]  room and not select any boys, not select any girls, but just let the pollen fly.
[15:08.650 --> 15:13.370]  There will probably be somewhere between four and six boys and four and six girls.
[15:13.370 --> 15:15.910]  So we're going to have, I'm just going to say five and five because it makes it easy
[15:15.910 --> 15:16.910]  to remember and balance.
[15:16.910 --> 15:21.170]  We're going to have five male plants putting pollen on five different girl plants, but
[15:21.170 --> 15:25.570]  it's not going to be male one to male two to male two to male two or however I said
[15:25.570 --> 15:26.570]  that.
[15:26.570 --> 15:28.730]  It's not going to be plant A and plant A and plant B and plant B.
[15:28.750 --> 15:31.610]  It's going to be all of the mixes of those.
[15:31.610 --> 15:36.530]  Male number A is going to pollinate plant number one, two, three, four, and five, but
[15:36.530 --> 15:40.810]  also on the same plant will be seeds that were made with the pollen from male number
[15:40.810 --> 15:41.810]  two.
[15:41.810 --> 15:44.450]  Also on the same plant will be seeds made from male number three.
[15:44.450 --> 15:48.530]  So we're going to have five female plants with five different baby daddy seeds in all
[15:48.530 --> 15:49.530]  of them.
[15:49.530 --> 15:50.530]  You're going to see, what is that?
[15:50.530 --> 15:54.330]  250,000 different combinations is the way that I think there might be more zeros on
[15:54.330 --> 15:55.330]  that.
[15:55.410 --> 15:59.130]  There might be 2,500,000 different combinations that you can, I'm going to stick with the
[15:59.130 --> 16:00.130]  250,000.
[16:00.130 --> 16:03.530]  It's got a lot of different combinations of phenotypical expression you could really come
[16:03.530 --> 16:04.650]  up with this way.
[16:04.650 --> 16:06.130]  So that's going to be a really fun project.
[16:06.130 --> 16:07.130]  That is open pollination.
[16:07.130 --> 16:10.870]  You guys, when you open some seeds and just put them all in the room and just let them
[16:10.870 --> 16:16.770]  have a big, a big old orgy in there, no selection, no elimination, no calling, just letting it
[16:16.770 --> 16:18.930]  happen the way that nature would do it.
[16:18.930 --> 16:21.890]  That puts off a lot of amazing, interesting phenotypes.
[16:21.890 --> 16:25.210]  And it sounds like our friend understands that they are going to open a Pandora's box
[16:26.090 --> 16:28.770]  and then from there they will select their winners for the next breeding project.
[16:28.770 --> 16:29.770]  Great strategy.
[16:29.770 --> 16:32.370]  It sounds like you're doing everything that you should be doing.
[16:32.370 --> 16:33.370]  And no, I have not.
[16:33.370 --> 16:37.530]  I think the main question was if I've seen the intersex traits on a plant that has been
[16:37.530 --> 16:38.530]  pollinated.
[16:38.530 --> 16:41.930]  No, that's something I've never seen and I've never seen intersex and the jack tripper.
[16:41.930 --> 16:43.690]  So you are off to a very good start.
[16:43.690 --> 16:45.210]  All right, let's keep the show moving.
[16:45.210 --> 16:47.250]  I do have one more question here in front of me.
[16:47.250 --> 16:49.530]  This one came from our friend Smurf Grown.
[16:49.530 --> 16:53.090]  Of course, this did come from the Grow Help tab on the iRegenetics website.
[16:53.090 --> 16:57.130]  So that means that our friend Smurf Grown wins a free pack of iRegenetic seeds.
[16:57.130 --> 16:58.810]  Smurf, please do send me your address.
[16:58.810 --> 17:02.250]  I will get some seeds in the mail to you as soon as possible.
[17:02.250 --> 17:06.090]  And just a quick heads up, if you have won seeds, if you've sent me your address at this
[17:06.090 --> 17:09.210]  point in time, all of the seed winners are in the mail.
[17:09.210 --> 17:12.890]  If you have won seeds and you have not sent me your address, please send me your address.
[17:12.890 --> 17:15.890]  If you've already sent it and you haven't gotten your seeds, feel free to send it again.
[17:15.890 --> 17:17.890]  I will do my best to get those seeds out to you.
[17:17.890 --> 17:22.530]  And don't worry, I do verify that your question was on the show before I send you seeds.
[17:22.970 --> 17:23.970]  Don't try to scam me.
[17:23.970 --> 17:24.970]  I'm paying attention.
[17:24.970 --> 17:25.970]  Let's keep moving.
[17:25.970 --> 17:27.570]  This one says, hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[17:27.570 --> 17:32.490]  In one of your episodes, you say an S1 is when you take two clones of the same plant
[17:32.490 --> 17:35.130]  and reverse one and pollinate the other.
[17:35.130 --> 17:37.130]  Can the reversed plant pollinate itself?
[17:37.130 --> 17:39.490]  And is this considered an S1 as well?
[17:39.490 --> 17:41.370]  Thank you and keep the great knowledge coming.
[17:41.370 --> 17:43.730]  Yes, that is absolutely an S1 as well.
[17:43.730 --> 17:45.130]  That's the same thing.
[17:45.130 --> 17:49.170]  The reason I don't recommend or prefer that is because when it comes to reversing a plant,
[17:49.210 --> 17:53.730]  I like to put the reversed plant into flower a little bit sooner than the plant that will
[17:53.730 --> 17:54.730]  receive pollen.
[17:54.730 --> 17:56.610]  That is just a timing issue.
[17:56.610 --> 17:59.210]  You have to start spraying the plant two weeks before you put it.
[17:59.210 --> 18:04.570]  The pollen donor needs to be sprayed two weeks to 10 days before it goes into flower.
[18:04.570 --> 18:07.130]  So I need to spray that at one time.
[18:07.130 --> 18:11.450]  Then I need to put that plant into flower in seven to 10 days from the first spray.
[18:11.450 --> 18:16.410]  Then it needs to be sprayed every third day for the next about 21 to 24 days.
[18:16.410 --> 18:19.410]  That's going to get about seven to 10 total sprays.
[18:19.410 --> 18:24.410]  Then at some point I need to put my female plants into flower to catch up with that male plant.
[18:24.410 --> 18:29.010]  So the pollen comes out at the right time when the pistils are ripe on the female plant.
[18:29.010 --> 18:33.010]  The reason I don't prefer to do this to the same plant is because those pistils and that
[18:33.010 --> 18:36.210]  pollen don't time up as good as they could.
[18:36.210 --> 18:41.650]  If I wait to put my female plants into flower when I see that male plant just showing signs
[18:41.650 --> 18:45.970]  of being reversed, I know what a female plant looks like when it begins to flower.
[18:45.970 --> 18:48.730]  There's a little variation when the reversal was successful.
[18:48.730 --> 18:50.890]  It'll start where the plant will start to make a bud.
[18:50.890 --> 18:53.410]  It makes just a little thing that looks different.
[18:53.410 --> 18:57.570]  It's a nub and it's going to be an anther eventually, but I can identify it soon.
[18:57.570 --> 19:00.890]  As soon as I see those, that's when the female plant goes into flower.
[19:00.890 --> 19:04.490]  That way the pollen comes out at the right time when the pistils are ripe on the female
[19:04.490 --> 19:06.490]  plant to receive that pollen.
[19:06.490 --> 19:10.210]  If I were to do it on the same plant, the pollen will come out way too early and the
[19:10.210 --> 19:14.370]  pistils won't be ripe enough or the pistils will be overripe and the pollen won't come
[19:14.370 --> 19:15.370]  out soon enough.
[19:15.370 --> 19:17.810]  It's plant dependent, strain dependent.
[19:17.810 --> 19:19.930]  Some plants really want pollen earlier.
[19:19.930 --> 19:23.090]  Some plants want pollen a lot later in the game.
[19:23.090 --> 19:27.130]  Two plants that make a really good example of that situation are the strawberry fields,
[19:27.130 --> 19:31.350]  which makes strawberry starburst and the platinum tangy, which makes the sun kiss also makes
[19:31.350 --> 19:34.710]  the orange gasm, but that's a whole nother story.
[19:34.710 --> 19:39.290]  Those plants, they want pollen at completely different times, about a week apart.
[19:39.290 --> 19:42.930]  The platinum tangy is ready for pollen super early.
[19:42.930 --> 19:45.690]  She's like, hey, pollen Amy, here I am.
[19:45.690 --> 19:49.330]  The strawberry fields plant is standing in the room going, bitch, you early.
[19:49.330 --> 19:51.810]  She's just looking at her like, I'm going to wait for the good pollen.
[19:51.810 --> 19:55.770]  That strawberry starburst plant is a full week behind the platinum tangy for when it
[19:55.770 --> 19:56.770]  wants pollen.
[19:56.770 --> 19:57.770]  It's just sitting back waiting.
[19:57.770 --> 19:58.770]  It gets bigger.
[19:58.770 --> 19:59.770]  It keeps on growing.
[19:59.770 --> 20:00.770]  It's still developing.
[20:00.770 --> 20:01.770]  It's still booming.
[20:01.770 --> 20:05.850]  It's still developing like a plant should, but those pistils, those sexual organs of
[20:05.850 --> 20:09.170]  that plant are just not ready to receive the pollen yet.
[20:09.170 --> 20:12.810]  The reason that I do my plants separately, the reason that I timed the plant separately
[20:12.810 --> 20:16.210]  is just to get them into the room at the appropriate time.
[20:16.210 --> 20:19.690]  If this is your first attempt at doing any breeding, if this is your first attempt at
[20:19.690 --> 20:22.170]  making seeds, this will work for you.
[20:22.170 --> 20:24.750]  You won't make as many seeds as you could.
[20:24.750 --> 20:27.630]  If you did this to two different plants, you could definitely make more seeds.
[20:27.630 --> 20:30.970]  Think about you're reversing one side and not reversing the other.
[20:30.970 --> 20:34.970]  You're going to have to spray a couple of branches or one branch of a plant very frequently
[20:34.970 --> 20:38.890]  and make sure not to spray the other branches of that plant because the one you spray will
[20:39.610 --> 20:40.610]  reverse.
[20:40.610 --> 20:42.450]  Some plants are very stubborn.
[20:42.450 --> 20:45.490]  Some plants, if you don't spray the whole thing, it won't reverse.
[20:45.490 --> 20:49.330]  The hormones over here, tell the hormones over here, nah, and they just, they argue
[20:49.330 --> 20:50.330]  about it.
[20:50.330 --> 20:51.850]  This one will reverse halfway.
[20:51.850 --> 20:53.170]  This one will flower halfway.
[20:53.170 --> 20:54.890]  Both sides will look like shit.
[20:54.890 --> 20:57.670]  So sometimes you'll be trying to reverse the right side of the plant and keep the left
[20:57.670 --> 21:00.770]  side of the plant non-reversed and the plant just doesn't want to do that.
[21:00.770 --> 21:03.910]  The hormones are just not allowing that to happen in the plant.
[21:03.910 --> 21:08.490]  Sometimes it's a more sativa dominant tropical type of a plant that that'll happen to.
[21:09.090 --> 21:12.130]  Sometimes some of the OG Kush type plants don't even want to reverse at all.
[21:12.130 --> 21:14.010]  Some plants are stubborn, some are not.
[21:14.010 --> 21:18.690]  That's why it's much easier to have an individual isolated plant that you were attempting to
[21:18.690 --> 21:19.690]  reverse.
[21:19.690 --> 21:21.130]  Then you can reverse that plant.
[21:21.130 --> 21:22.690]  You can get it into flower.
[21:22.690 --> 21:26.250]  And since I understand when my plants go into flower and when they want pollen, I could
[21:26.250 --> 21:29.170]  get that male into the flower room, get him flowering.
[21:29.170 --> 21:32.650]  Then I could drag in that strawberry starburst plant and get her a headstart.
[21:32.650 --> 21:36.130]  Then a few days later I could bring in the platinum tangy plant, get them right on schedule.
[21:36.130 --> 21:40.130]  And when the pollen comes, both of those plants are going to produce maximum amount
[21:40.130 --> 21:41.530]  of seeds for me.
[21:41.530 --> 21:42.730]  So your idea will work.
[21:42.730 --> 21:46.630]  If it's your first idea, your first attempt, you will bang out some seeds as long as the
[21:46.630 --> 21:49.370]  one side reverses and the other side stays true.
[21:49.370 --> 21:50.370]  You'll be okay.
[21:50.370 --> 21:51.370]  Sometimes that doesn't work out.
[21:51.370 --> 21:54.570]  That is plant specific, but it should work for you in most cases.
[21:54.570 --> 21:57.530]  However, I do recommend two separate plants.
[21:57.530 --> 22:00.210]  However, the main question was, will this still be an S1?
[22:00.210 --> 22:02.850]  Yes, this is absolutely still an S1.
[22:02.850 --> 22:07.170]  We've taken pollen from a specific cultivar and we've pollinated that specific cultivar
[22:07.170 --> 22:08.170]  with that pollen.
[22:08.170 --> 22:09.390]  It's unadulterated.
[22:09.390 --> 22:10.390]  It's female pollen.
[22:10.390 --> 22:14.810]  It's a female plant that is a feminized S1 seed.
[22:14.810 --> 22:15.810]  Congratulations.
[22:15.810 --> 22:17.530]  If you do this, let me know how it goes.
[22:17.530 --> 22:19.050]  Let me know how you decided to do it.
[22:19.050 --> 22:22.610]  Did you stick with one plant being the pollen donor and the pollen giver?
[22:22.610 --> 22:24.570]  Or did you decide to use two plants?
[22:24.570 --> 22:26.690]  How many female plants did you put in the room?
[22:26.690 --> 22:29.850]  And then my overall question is going to be, how many seeds did you get?
[22:29.850 --> 22:31.050]  Have you grown them?
[22:31.050 --> 22:32.050]  And what are they like?
[22:32.250 --> 22:33.410]  All right, that's what I want to know.
[22:33.410 --> 22:36.050]  My friend Smurfgrown, thank you for the great question.
[22:36.050 --> 22:39.810]  Please remember to send me your address because I do owe you a free pack of iReed Genetics

[23:19.090 --> 23:20.330]  I'm not even going to try to measure that.
[23:20.330 --> 23:22.130]  There are a lot of pages of paper there.
