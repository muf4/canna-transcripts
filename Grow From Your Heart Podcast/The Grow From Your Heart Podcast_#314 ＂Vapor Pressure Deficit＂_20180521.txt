[00:02.170 --> 00:05.370]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.370 --> 00:09.370]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:09.370 --> 00:10.970]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:10.970 --> 00:11.970]  That's right.
[00:11.970 --> 00:16.170]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:16.170 --> 00:20.210]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current
[00:20.210 --> 00:23.770]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:23.770 --> 00:24.770]  I'm your host.
[00:24.770 --> 00:26.050]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.050 --> 00:29.170]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.170 --> 00:33.130]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.130 --> 00:37.510]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:37.510 --> 00:40.970]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.970 --> 00:45.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[00:45.110 --> 00:55.640]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:55.640 --> 00:56.680]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:56.680 --> 00:59.120]  It's time for episode 314.
[00:59.120 --> 01:01.560]  I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm dabbing on.
[01:01.560 --> 01:06.440]  Right before the show, I took a big fat dab of Star Child OG Live Resin from a cut above
[01:06.440 --> 01:08.160]  in Colorado Springs.
[01:08.160 --> 01:10.520]  I love the flavor of this concentrate.
[01:10.520 --> 01:13.760]  They told me it was tangerine haze and train wreck.
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.520]  I can certainly taste that train wreck, terpeneline, that dryer sheet sort of a smell.
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.000]  There's a very small hint of the tangerine haze in there, maybe on the aftertaste.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.080]  I love it.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.320]  The high is amazing.
[01:26.320 --> 01:27.960]  It's a super head high.
[01:27.960 --> 01:29.040]  Gets me nice and talkative.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.800]  Gets me nice and creative.
[01:30.800 --> 01:33.360]  Really good podcast dabs.
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.040]  Star Child OG Live Resin from a cut above in Colorado Springs.
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.040]  Great concentrate.
[01:38.040 --> 01:39.480]  Also, what a great name.
[01:39.480 --> 01:41.240]  I wish I had thought of that.
[01:41.240 --> 01:43.120]  But you know what I did think of, you guys?
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.280]  What a great segue.
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.360]  I've got a plant called Cactus Cooler, and it's called Cactus Cooler because it tastes
[01:48.360 --> 01:50.400]  just like the Cactus Cooler soda.
[01:50.400 --> 01:53.760]  It tastes like oranges and pineapples, and it is delicious.
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.760]  I did not breed it.
[01:54.760 --> 01:56.100]  I did not create it.
[01:56.100 --> 02:01.700]  The clone of Cactus Cooler was gifted to me by a friend, but I did breed it to my Arise.
[02:01.700 --> 02:07.400]  It has been given out as the freebie or as a bonus pack on thedankseed.store, but now
[02:07.400 --> 02:08.920]  it has an official name.
[02:08.920 --> 02:11.500]  It is officially called Pineapple Wine.
[02:11.500 --> 02:16.540]  So if you got a freebie five pack of the Cactus Cooler to Arise, you can change the label
[02:16.540 --> 02:18.260]  to Pineapple Wine.
[02:18.260 --> 02:20.660]  That is the new official name.
[02:20.660 --> 02:24.420]  And the reason I went with the Pineapple Wine, not only is it a great reggae song name and
[02:24.740 --> 02:28.900]  it represents that island flavor that it's got and the vibe of the strain that I felt,
[02:28.900 --> 02:35.700]  but it carried that pineapple and fruity flavor over, but it's also the, there's a chem dog
[02:35.700 --> 02:40.740]  and an OG Kush and a funky flavor that kind of came along with it that was added to the
[02:40.740 --> 02:44.900]  pineapple flavor and it kind of gives it sort of a fermented wine, funky sort of a thing.
[02:44.900 --> 02:47.500]  So Pineapple Wine was a perfect name.
[02:47.500 --> 02:48.700]  It's going to make giant plants.
[02:48.700 --> 02:50.460]  You're going to get big old buds.
[02:50.460 --> 02:52.740]  The concentrates are amazing.
[02:52.740 --> 02:56.360]  The concentrates that are going to come off of these buds are going to taste like pineapple
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.060]  candy and pineapple wine and fruity, delicious turps.
[03:00.060 --> 03:03.240]  And there will be plenty of concentrates coming off of these buds.
[03:03.240 --> 03:06.580]  So Pineapple Wine at dankseed.store.
[03:06.580 --> 03:07.780]  Make sure you check them out, you guys.
[03:07.780 --> 03:08.780]  All right.
[03:08.780 --> 03:11.220]  I've got a couple of questions that came from Instagram.
[03:11.220 --> 03:16.420]  Let's start with, I think this one was kind of fun, kind of funny, and I want your opinion
[03:16.420 --> 03:17.420]  on it.
[03:17.420 --> 03:18.420]  I thought it was a great question.
[03:18.420 --> 03:22.340]  I don't have a real answer, but I wanted to share this with my listeners.
[03:22.340 --> 03:23.340]  It goes like this.
[03:23.340 --> 03:24.340]  Hello, bro.
[03:24.340 --> 03:25.340]  Hope you're well.
[03:25.340 --> 03:27.120]  I had a mad stoned thought.
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.860]  If you use beneficial insects, does that mean their poo ends up on the bud like the same
[03:31.860 --> 03:32.860]  if it was pests?
[03:32.860 --> 03:37.740]  Would it be sensible to rinse or soak your finished plants like Jorge does with the ones
[03:37.740 --> 03:38.740]  with PM?
[03:38.740 --> 03:41.180]  Now that's a really good question about the bug poo.
[03:41.180 --> 03:44.320]  I never thought about the other bug poo.
[03:44.320 --> 03:47.680]  Of course, those bugs that go in there and eat the spider mites, they're going to have
[03:47.680 --> 03:48.980]  to poo somewhere.
[03:48.980 --> 03:51.700]  They're probably pooing right on your leaves.
[03:51.700 --> 03:53.220]  They're not going to be pooping in the buds.
[03:53.220 --> 03:57.020]  The bugs don't really live in the buds as much.
[03:57.020 --> 03:59.560]  You'll notice the spider mites don't really go into the buds.
[03:59.560 --> 04:00.620]  They're more on the leaves.
[04:00.620 --> 04:03.020]  They want to suck the chlorophyll out of the leaves.
[04:03.020 --> 04:04.300]  They prefer the weaker leaves.
[04:04.300 --> 04:06.940]  They don't want to go sucking on the buds as much.
[04:06.940 --> 04:09.580]  You do find them making their little teepees up on top of the buds.
[04:09.580 --> 04:12.860]  That's just because they want to get up high so the fan can grab them.
[04:12.860 --> 04:15.820]  The wind can blow them to the next plant and they can start taking over the next plant
[04:15.820 --> 04:17.460]  and build their colony.
[04:17.460 --> 04:20.240]  But you'll notice that they don't eat the buds.
[04:20.240 --> 04:21.300]  They eat the leaves.
[04:21.900 --> 04:24.820]  Hopefully, the predator bugs are going to get in there and they're going to realize
[04:24.820 --> 04:28.220]  that all those trichomes and all that resin is not a fun place to be.
[04:28.220 --> 04:30.020]  They're just going to hang out on the leaves.
[04:30.020 --> 04:32.140]  They're going to go and eat all the shitty bugs.
[04:32.140 --> 04:36.060]  Then they're just going to shit right there on the leaves.
[04:36.060 --> 04:38.900]  Then hopefully, you're going to trim that off and you're not going to get too much of
[04:38.900 --> 04:45.660]  the beneficial insect poop into your buds, your concentrates, and eventually, of course,
[04:45.660 --> 04:48.100]  into your edibles.
[04:48.100 --> 04:52.660]  How much poop do you think a little tiny spider mite eater is going to make?
[04:52.660 --> 04:55.340]  Because spider mites are microscopic.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.900]  How big is their poop going to be?
[04:56.900 --> 05:02.740]  I think I would rather have that little bit of spider mite poop in my garden than more
[05:02.740 --> 05:05.660]  spider mites producing more spider mite eggs.
[05:05.660 --> 05:10.420]  Hopefully, by the time you harvest it, it's been blown off by a fan or knocked off by
[05:10.420 --> 05:11.420]  a spray.
[05:11.420 --> 05:14.060]  Hopefully, that little tiny bit of poop is gone.
[05:14.060 --> 05:15.980]  Hopefully, it gets knocked off.
[05:15.980 --> 05:19.940]  In the last part of your message, you say, should we dunk it like we've seen Jorge Cervantes
[05:19.940 --> 05:21.780]  do for powdery mildew?
[05:21.780 --> 05:25.980]  If you guys aren't familiar with that, there's a video of Jorge Cervantes.
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.820]  He takes a five-gallon bucket.
[05:27.820 --> 05:30.460]  He fills it most of the way with water.
[05:30.460 --> 05:33.020]  He puts the 30% hydrogen peroxide in there.
[05:33.020 --> 05:34.020]  He stirs it up.
[05:34.020 --> 05:36.160]  Then he takes long colas that he's harvested.
[05:36.160 --> 05:37.980]  They're freshly harvested, mostly trimmed up.
[05:37.980 --> 05:39.700]  He trims them most of the way.
[05:39.700 --> 05:44.260]  Then he dunks these buds straight into the hydrogen peroxide and gives them a shake.
[05:44.260 --> 05:47.340]  You can see the powdery mildew come right off of the buds.
[05:47.340 --> 05:50.180]  It floats to the surface right at the top of the water.
[05:50.180 --> 05:51.180]  Then he pulls them out.
[05:51.180 --> 05:52.780]  Then he just hangs them up to dry.
[05:52.780 --> 05:56.540]  That method does work if you've got powdery mildew or if you're trying to clean something
[05:56.540 --> 05:57.540]  off.
[05:57.540 --> 05:58.540]  It's a shitty method.
[05:58.540 --> 05:59.540]  It's funky.
[05:59.540 --> 06:02.740]  I'd rather you figure out what your problem is and correct that and get rid of the mildewy
[06:02.740 --> 06:03.740]  stuff.
[06:03.740 --> 06:06.860]  I understand that in a commercial grow, sometimes shit has to happen.
[06:06.860 --> 06:09.580]  It's not the best way to do things, but I get it.
[06:09.580 --> 06:10.780]  Sometimes you're not the boss.
[06:10.780 --> 06:13.220]  Sometimes you're told what to do, whatever.
[06:13.220 --> 06:16.020]  That method does work if you're in dire straits.
[06:16.020 --> 06:20.700]  I wouldn't do it in fear of predatory mite poop.
[06:20.700 --> 06:22.820]  That's a little overreactive.
[06:22.820 --> 06:28.220]  What you could do toward the end of the flowering cycle, you could spray the plants lightly
[06:28.220 --> 06:31.100]  with just clean water.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.100]  That wouldn't be a problem.
[06:32.100 --> 06:35.420]  If you don't soak them to where they're dripping, to where the buds are going to get saturated
[06:35.420 --> 06:37.820]  like sponges, you could just dust them off.
[06:37.820 --> 06:39.340]  That's kind of a common thing.
[06:39.340 --> 06:41.780]  You could just go in there and hit them lightly with water.
[06:41.780 --> 06:45.820]  If you use the paint sprayer or if you pump up the sprayer real hard, it'll just spray
[06:45.820 --> 06:49.620]  them like a little bit of wind and a little bit of water and just clean them off.
[06:49.620 --> 06:57.540]  Hopefully, hopefully that's knocking off any predatory insect poop that you think may have
[06:57.540 --> 06:58.780]  gathered up on the buds.
[06:58.780 --> 07:00.220]  There's not going to be much.
[07:00.220 --> 07:03.540]  If you're running a large grow and you've released thousands of predators in there,
[07:03.540 --> 07:04.860]  you're not going to get enough.
[07:04.860 --> 07:10.140]  You're not going to find a half a gram of bug shit in the whole thing, I wouldn't imagine.
[07:10.140 --> 07:16.940]  The little tiny bit of predatory mite poop that does happen is way better than spider
[07:16.940 --> 07:23.100]  mite eggs and spider mites and spider mite webbing and a diminished crop quality and
[07:23.100 --> 07:26.940]  a lessened harvest weight because you let the spider mites take hold.
[07:26.940 --> 07:30.820]  It's way better, think about it this way, I didn't even get to this part of my head
[07:30.820 --> 07:35.340]  yet, it's way better than smoking some questionable pesticide.
[07:35.340 --> 07:38.420]  Maybe you smoked a couple of pieces of bug poop.
[07:38.420 --> 07:43.100]  I haven't even established how much bug poop we may have smoked, but maybe you're smoking
[07:43.100 --> 07:46.020]  a minuscule amount, a little bug turds.
[07:46.020 --> 07:52.980]  We know that bug turds are less harmful than a little bit of flora mite.
[07:52.980 --> 07:59.320]  We know that some bug turds are a little bit less harmful for you than pyrethrums.
[07:59.320 --> 08:06.180]  We know that I would rather smoke a little bit of bug turd than consume something covered
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.860]  in funky pesticides.
[08:08.860 --> 08:13.500]  I think it's worth it, it's a fair trade-off for me, I think it's a great conversation.
[08:13.500 --> 08:15.100]  What do you guys think?
[08:15.100 --> 08:19.700]  Do you think that the predatory mites that I'm releasing in my garden are taking a shit
[08:19.700 --> 08:20.700]  in my buds?
[08:20.700 --> 08:22.940]  Do you think they're taking a shit on the leaves?
[08:22.940 --> 08:24.700]  Because they obviously poop.
[08:24.700 --> 08:27.900]  All creatures that are eating something, they're going to poop something out.
[08:27.900 --> 08:28.900]  Where's that poop going?
[08:28.900 --> 08:32.460]  Is it ending up in the cannabis that we're smoking?
[08:32.460 --> 08:34.260]  Do you think it's shaking off during harvest?
[08:34.260 --> 08:41.820]  Do you think the bug poop is coming off then?
[08:41.820 --> 08:44.820]  Do you think the light spray that we apply toward the end of harvest, do you think that
[08:44.820 --> 08:46.420]  gets rid of the bug poop?
[08:46.420 --> 08:47.420]  What do you think?
[08:47.420 --> 08:48.420]  I want your opinion, you guys.
[08:48.420 --> 08:53.140]  Send me an email, it's growlfromyourheartathotmail.com or tweet me at GFYHpodcast.
[08:53.140 --> 08:56.460]  Let's talk about bug poop in cannabis.
[08:56.460 --> 09:01.620]  Either way, however much bug poop we're smoking, I think it's probably safer and better than
[09:01.620 --> 09:03.540]  smoking a bunch of crazy pesticides.
[09:03.540 --> 09:05.580]  Hey dude, thanks for the great message.
[09:05.580 --> 09:09.220]  I'm not sure if you want your name said on the podcast, you didn't mention that.
[09:09.220 --> 09:10.980]  And you also said it was a stoned idea.
[09:10.980 --> 09:15.020]  So thanks for getting stoned and having a great idea that started a conversation and
[09:15.020 --> 09:17.620]  created some podcast content.
[09:17.620 --> 09:20.460]  I've got another question that came from Instagram Live.
[09:20.460 --> 09:22.340]  This one is about lab testing.
[09:22.340 --> 09:27.500]  An Instagram Live watcher asked, when we send a sample to a lab for potency testing, do
[09:27.500 --> 09:31.940]  we send just the top or do we send certain parts of the plant?
[09:31.940 --> 09:33.860]  And that's a very good question.
[09:33.860 --> 09:38.580]  Because the procedure was recently changed by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[09:38.580 --> 09:44.700]  by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and also the Colorado Department
[09:44.700 --> 09:45.700]  of Agriculture.
[09:45.700 --> 09:51.620]  They all got together and they made a new testing guideline, or a new sample collection
[09:51.620 --> 09:53.540]  standard operating procedure is what it is.
[09:53.540 --> 09:54.820]  It's the new sample collection.
[09:54.820 --> 09:59.780]  The potency and contaminant sample collection standard operating procedure and it was sent
[09:59.780 --> 10:04.940]  out to all of the grows, everybody with a metric ID number got the email recently.
[10:04.940 --> 10:07.420]  And we all had to kind of change the way that we collect samples.
[10:07.420 --> 10:12.020]  So now we are not allowed to just send in the best looking buds.
[10:12.020 --> 10:14.220]  No, that's not what we do.
[10:14.220 --> 10:15.380]  Everything happens on camera.
[10:15.380 --> 10:19.220]  There are every inch of a grow facility is on camera.
[10:19.220 --> 10:24.340]  If you're at a Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division regulated recreational or medical
[10:24.860 --> 10:26.100]  grow, you are on camera.
[10:26.100 --> 10:28.220]  So it all happens on camera.
[10:28.220 --> 10:30.980]  This happens in a very specific room.
[10:30.980 --> 10:33.580]  There's a very specific way that the samples are to be collected.
[10:33.580 --> 10:38.140]  I'm not going to tell you the entire procedure, but I'll tell you why we're not able to just
[10:38.140 --> 10:42.380]  take those prime choice tops that look like they're the best.
[10:42.380 --> 10:48.380]  When we harvest, there are going to be between 20 and 60 plants of the same strain, and they'll
[10:48.380 --> 10:51.120]  all be harvested as the same batch.
[10:51.120 --> 10:52.780]  So let's just pick a strain.
[10:52.780 --> 10:54.620]  We'll say ghost dog.
[10:54.620 --> 10:57.220]  Say we just took down 40 ghost dog plants.
[10:57.220 --> 11:01.180]  That is a batch and they've got a batch ID number.
[11:01.180 --> 11:04.740]  Those ghost dog plants aren't all going to fit in one container when they go into our
[11:04.740 --> 11:06.000]  dry and cure room.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.340]  They're going to get separated.
[11:07.340 --> 11:11.100]  They're going to get in into probably I don't even want to guess how many I'll say eight
[11:11.100 --> 11:14.620]  to 10 different containers and they're going to have different numbers on them.
[11:14.620 --> 11:20.440]  They're going to say ghost dog batch, whatever container number one, ghost dog batch number
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.760]  or whatever container number two, and they'll be labeled up to whatever number they are.
[11:24.760 --> 11:26.100]  Then they're going to get trimmed.
[11:26.100 --> 11:29.700]  Then they're going to get put into containers after they're trimmed.
[11:29.700 --> 11:35.700]  Each of those containers will still be labeled ghost dog batch number, a fucking container
[11:35.700 --> 11:36.880]  number, whatever.
[11:36.880 --> 11:40.680]  Then we're going to get instructions from the lab testing place.
[11:40.680 --> 11:44.880]  That's going to say, okay, ghost dog batch number, whatever you're talking about, container
[11:44.880 --> 11:50.820]  number three, grab that container, open it up, then go to the far bottom left corner.
[11:50.820 --> 11:53.560]  We want, and these are dried and cured and trimmed buds.
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.280]  These are buds that have been trimmed and dried and cured and that are ready to go to
[11:56.280 --> 11:57.360]  the store.
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.880]  So the next step is to reach into there and get one out of the bottom left like they requested
[12:01.880 --> 12:05.080]  and put that sample in the sampling container.
[12:05.080 --> 12:06.840]  Then they'll request another bud though.
[12:06.840 --> 12:12.240]  They may say ghost dog batch number, whatever container number six, open the container and
[12:12.240 --> 12:14.640]  take the bud from the very top, right in the middle.
[12:14.680 --> 12:15.680]  Then, okay, cool.
[12:15.680 --> 12:17.520]  We'll open it up, take the bud right out of the middle.
[12:17.520 --> 12:21.360]  Then that bud goes into our little collection container and then they'll give you different
[12:21.360 --> 12:25.760]  various areas to take plants from or to take your samples from.
[12:25.760 --> 12:28.680]  You've got to follow those instructions and you've got to actually sign for it and you've
[12:28.680 --> 12:31.440]  got to have a witness and you've got to mark it down on a little paper.
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.400]  So quite often it's, hey Mike, did Jeff do his job?
[12:34.400 --> 12:36.000]  And Mike's got to sign off for it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  Yes, Jeff actually took these samples.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.680]  So no, we're not allowed to just go and get those prime looking buds.
[12:41.680 --> 12:43.080]  And all of this stuff is done.
[12:43.080 --> 12:45.040]  I'm wearing a face mask.
[12:45.040 --> 12:48.360]  I've got a mask on my face so I don't get any beard hair into there so I don't breathe
[12:48.360 --> 12:49.840]  into it.
[12:49.840 --> 12:52.280]  I've got goggles on.
[12:52.280 --> 12:54.200]  I've got rubber gloves on.
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.800]  And then I've got a lab coat or a Tyvek suit that I've cut the leg end off of to make a
[12:59.800 --> 13:03.240]  little makeshift lab coat because it's a little lighter and easier to work with.
[13:03.240 --> 13:04.240]  So I'm all covered up.
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.280]  I'm all lab procedured.
[13:06.280 --> 13:09.360]  If I switch strains, I will switch gloves.
[13:09.360 --> 13:14.160]  If I am using scissors to maybe cut some stems out or something, I would actually switch
[13:14.160 --> 13:19.160]  scissors or clean the scissors to make sure that if one sample has a microbial contaminant
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.120]  that I don't move that to different samples and mess things up for our sampling.
[13:23.120 --> 13:25.760]  You got to keep things sterilized.
[13:25.760 --> 13:27.560]  You got to keep things separate.
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.880]  It is a pretty tedious task of taking samples to pass the Colorado standards.
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.840]  Now these samples that we're taking for potency, these are also our microbial samples.
[13:38.840 --> 13:44.880]  So we send in the same sample to the same lab to check the level of THC, CBD and a few
[13:44.880 --> 13:46.200]  other cannabinoids.
[13:46.200 --> 13:49.880]  You can do a terpene test, but it costs more money.
[13:49.880 --> 13:52.840]  Also they will run a microbial test on there.
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.640]  They will look for yeast and mold.
[13:54.640 --> 13:57.480]  And I'm not sure everything that they look for because we've never had a problem.
[13:57.480 --> 13:58.880]  Nothing has come up.
[13:58.880 --> 14:00.560]  We're doing things correctly.
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.800]  But also at the same time, they run a random pesticide test.
[14:05.800 --> 14:11.120]  I'm not sure who decides to run the pesticide test, but randomly it happens.
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.120]  And when they run that pesticide test, they can tell you if pesticides were applied to
[14:15.120 --> 14:16.160]  the buds.
[14:16.160 --> 14:19.200]  They can tell you which pesticides were applied to the buds.
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.560]  And they can tell you if they were illegal pesticides that are allowed by the Colorado
[14:23.560 --> 14:28.160]  Department of Agriculture and the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division, along with
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.000]  the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.280]  They know what was applied to your buds.
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.180]  So there's no fooling these tests.
[14:37.180 --> 14:41.320]  You're getting your microbe test, your potency test and your pesticide test from the same
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.480]  sample.
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.000]  We're actually required to send in four grams.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.400]  So they're able to do up to four tests if they require a gram per test.
[14:49.400 --> 14:51.960]  And I think they should be able to test it with just a half a gram.
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.760]  So they can probably do somewhere between four and eight, hopefully six solid tests.
[14:56.760 --> 14:58.120]  So they can test us for potency.
[14:58.120 --> 15:00.860]  If we come up real high, they can retest it.
[15:00.860 --> 15:02.400]  They can test it for microbes.
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.960]  If it comes up with something, hopefully they've got enough for another test.
[15:05.960 --> 15:08.440]  And then if they're going to test us for all that and they see something weird, then I
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.240]  would just say run that pesticide test just to see if they're doing something fishy.
[15:12.240 --> 15:14.760]  And then you're going to need that fifth and sixth sample.
[15:14.760 --> 15:17.320]  And then when it all comes back legit, they're going to say, well, fucking test it again
[15:17.320 --> 15:19.320]  for potency because that Rasta Jeff killed it.
[15:19.320 --> 15:21.880]  And they're going to need sample number seven at that point.
[15:21.880 --> 15:23.360]  But that's just hypothetical.
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.080]  Anyway, no, the question was, do you guys just send in the main top for lab testing?
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.080]  No, we do not.
[15:29.080 --> 15:35.280]  We are specifically instructed by the laboratory through an email of which parts of the plant
[15:35.280 --> 15:37.560]  to send in for testing.
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.840]  And before those regulations were like that, we were still not allowed to just send in
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.840]  the main top.
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.240]  You were supposed to pull parts from different parts of the plant.
[15:45.240 --> 15:50.680]  I would actually be dried, trimmed, cured buds that are ready for the store, like buds
[15:50.680 --> 15:52.920]  that are, you're almost ready to drive them to the store.
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.080]  You're just waiting for the lab test.
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.720]  That's what gets tested.
[15:56.720 --> 15:58.800]  So we get it tested and then it's got to sit there.
[15:59.520 --> 16:02.280]  We're not even allowed to sell it until that lab test comes back.
[16:02.280 --> 16:03.800]  It's not allowed to leave the grow.
[16:03.800 --> 16:06.640]  It can't go to the store until it's lab tested.
[16:06.640 --> 16:08.400]  So you guys know it's safe.
[16:08.400 --> 16:13.480]  It's also not allowed to go to a concentrate or edible maker if it hasn't been tested yet.
[16:13.480 --> 16:18.120]  So if we've got trim or buds set aside that we want to make concentrate out of, we're
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.680]  not allowed to send that until the buds have been tested and we know that everything is
[16:22.680 --> 16:23.920]  clean and safe.
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.560]  So no, basically we're not allowed to send just the tops was what your question was.
[16:28.600 --> 16:36.320]  And oftentimes you may find that the tops don't hold the most THC A. Sometimes the light
[16:36.320 --> 16:39.920]  was too close and it cooked the THC right out of them.
[16:39.920 --> 16:42.600]  Sometimes those bottom buds get a little frostier.
[16:42.600 --> 16:44.800]  Sometimes the tops got touched too much.
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.120]  Sometimes those big old tops were just handled and destroyed.
[16:48.120 --> 16:52.080]  Sometimes you'll find those middle buds have the better potency, but that is not always
[16:52.080 --> 16:53.080]  the case.
[16:53.080 --> 16:54.080]  All right.
[16:54.080 --> 16:55.080]  Thanks again for another great question.
[16:55.080 --> 16:58.520]  I'm not sure that that person wants their name revealed on the podcast, so I'm going
[16:58.520 --> 16:59.520]  to keep that private.
[16:59.520 --> 17:00.960]  They know who they are.
[17:00.960 --> 17:02.320]  Big shout out, much respect.
[17:02.320 --> 17:05.320]  Again, if you guys have a question, you can send me an email.
[17:05.320 --> 17:08.960]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:08.960 --> 17:10.240]  I would love to hear from you.
[17:10.240 --> 17:11.240]  All right.
[17:11.240 --> 17:14.440]  I've gotten a lot of requests to talk about vapor pressure deficit.
[17:14.440 --> 17:20.140]  So I wrote a few notes and I would like to teach you guys about vapor pressure deficit.
[17:20.140 --> 17:23.880]  Vapor pressure deficit has been the hot new buzzword in the cannabis community.
[17:23.880 --> 17:24.960]  It's been in the magazines.
[17:24.960 --> 17:26.640]  It's been in the forums.
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.440]  People are trying to sell you new equipment so that you can monitor your vapor pressure
[17:30.440 --> 17:31.920]  deficit.
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.640]  If you keep seeing the letters VPD in magazines, when people are talking about conditions in
[17:36.640 --> 17:40.280]  the grow room, they're talking about the vapor pressure deficit.
[17:40.280 --> 17:44.840]  Now let's talk about a couple of things before we work up to explaining the vapor pressure
[17:44.840 --> 17:45.840]  deficit.
[17:45.840 --> 17:51.160]  Now, before we can understand vapor pressure deficit, we need to learn about transpiration.
[17:51.160 --> 17:55.280]  A lot of you already know what transpiration is, but just to get everybody up to speed,
[17:55.280 --> 17:58.400]  transpiration, that is when water evaporates from the plants.
[17:58.400 --> 18:01.680]  Basically, the plants absorb the water through the roots, they use what they need, and then
[18:01.680 --> 18:06.400]  they release the excess nutrients through transpiration through the underside of the
[18:06.400 --> 18:07.400]  leaves.
[18:07.400 --> 18:12.280]  This is basically the plant's version of sweating or maybe the plant going to the bathroom.
[18:12.280 --> 18:18.120]  Now the main factors that contribute to transpiration are temperature and humidity.
[18:18.120 --> 18:21.660]  When the grow room gets hot, the plants will sweat and transpire.
[18:21.660 --> 18:29.280]  The vapor pressure deficit is what decides how much those plants are allowed to transpire.
[18:29.280 --> 18:32.840]  The vapor pressure deficit is basically what the plants feel.
[18:32.840 --> 18:37.260]  The main force that moves water vapor out of the leaf is the vapor pressure difference
[18:37.260 --> 18:41.900]  between the water vapor inside the leaf and the water vapor surrounding the leaf.
[18:41.900 --> 18:47.360]  So if there is too much vapor around that leaf, it won't be able to release more vapor.
[18:47.360 --> 18:52.220]  If there is not enough, then it's going to just go wide open and release too much.
[18:52.220 --> 18:54.760]  But the plant is smart and it tries to prevent that.
[18:54.760 --> 18:58.920]  So if it's too dry and the plant can feel that it's too dry and it's releasing too much
[18:58.920 --> 19:04.320]  vapor, it will actually close the stomata and stop itself from dehydrating itself.
[19:04.320 --> 19:09.280]  So too high of a vapor pressure deficit, the stomata will close and the plant will basically
[19:09.280 --> 19:10.400]  stop functioning.
[19:10.400 --> 19:13.080]  Too high of a vapor pressure deficit, and guess what?
[19:13.080 --> 19:17.800]  That stomata will close and again stop functioning, which will cause your plant to slow down.
[19:17.800 --> 19:21.560]  Have you ever seen the plants just look like shit and you can't figure out why?
[19:21.560 --> 19:24.400]  The leaves are a little leathery, they're a little bit funky, or maybe they're a little
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.000]  bit crispy.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.520]  Oftentimes that's from a vapor pressure deficit.
[19:29.520 --> 19:33.680]  Oftentimes that's caused by a fan beating the shit out of that area of the plant.
[19:33.680 --> 19:37.720]  It's just moving all the vapor away and you've got nothing but dryness.
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.480]  So you've got a plant with no moisture, it's got these closed stomata because it's just
[19:41.480 --> 19:45.440]  dry all the time around there, and so the plant is actually struggling to keep that
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.760]  section happy and healthy and keep the nutrients moving the way that it should.
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.960]  So vapor pressure deficit is basically what the plants are feeling.
[19:53.960 --> 19:57.320]  Now think about yourself trying to breathe.
[19:57.320 --> 20:01.280]  Maybe you go to the desert where it's super dry, and then maybe another day you go to
[20:01.280 --> 20:04.560]  the zoo and you go to the rainforest area where it's super moist.
[20:04.560 --> 20:07.720]  Or shit, maybe you lived in Las Vegas where it's super dry, and then maybe you spent a
[20:07.720 --> 20:10.520]  summer in Lawrence, Kansas where it's super moist.
[20:10.560 --> 20:15.360]  Now think about how your skin and your lungs reacted to those different environments.
[20:15.360 --> 20:20.160]  When you go to Las Vegas, and it's super hot, it's 120 degrees and it's dry, you get out
[20:20.160 --> 20:23.120]  of the car, your skin starts to feel tight and dry.
[20:23.120 --> 20:26.440]  And when you go to breathe, your lungs are like, dude, that air is hot and dry, fuck
[20:26.440 --> 20:31.000]  you, your lungs get all dried out and you need water, you got to go get a drink, because
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.880]  you're just drying yourself out.
[20:32.880 --> 20:36.360]  Now imagine when you go to Kansas, and you get out of the car and your skin feels all
[20:36.360 --> 20:39.640]  moist and supple and your hair gets all funky and curly because all the moisture in the
[20:39.640 --> 20:43.760]  air, but you can breathe because all that moisture you just, you just suck in big old
[20:43.760 --> 20:46.440]  clouds because it's not dry and stale.
[20:46.440 --> 20:50.120]  That's the vapor pressure deficit having an effect on humans.
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.560]  Notice when it's a little cooler, you can breathe a little bit better.
[20:52.560 --> 20:55.680]  Notice if you ever have been in a walk-in cooler, you can breathe super well in the
[20:55.680 --> 20:57.040]  walk-in cooler.
[20:57.040 --> 21:00.380]  But have you ever been standing by the oven and tried to take a big deep breath?
[21:00.380 --> 21:01.960]  That's really unpleasant, right?
[21:01.960 --> 21:03.400]  That's sort of the same thing.
[21:03.400 --> 21:08.280]  That's a lot of a lot of temperature there, but there's also moisture being involved in
[21:08.280 --> 21:09.280]  that temperature.
[21:09.280 --> 21:10.720]  Now let's talk about the equation.
[21:10.720 --> 21:14.320]  I said earlier that vapor pressure deficit is actually a math equation.
[21:14.320 --> 21:15.840]  So let me try to explain this equation for you.
[21:15.840 --> 21:17.480]  I've got it written down.
[21:17.480 --> 21:25.240]  Vapor pressure deficit equals liquid saturation vapor pressure minus, okay, minus the air
[21:25.240 --> 21:30.720]  saturated vapor pressure times the air relative humidity.
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.640]  Now I'm going to say it again, so if you want to write it down, you can write this down.
[21:34.640 --> 21:43.480]  VPD equals LSVP, which is liquid saturation vapor, all right, minus, and then in parentheses,
[21:43.480 --> 21:53.320]  we've got the air saturation vapor pressure times the air percent of relative humidity.
[21:53.320 --> 22:03.320]  So you're multiplying air saturated vapor pressure times air relative humidity.
[22:03.320 --> 22:07.920]  Again, you are subtracting that from the liquid saturation vapor pressure.
[22:07.920 --> 22:11.680]  Now if that makes any sense to you, you'll understand how to do that equation.
[22:11.680 --> 22:13.320]  If not, it's not necessary.
[22:13.320 --> 22:15.160]  You do not need to do that equation.
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.500]  There are charts available.
[22:16.500 --> 22:18.260]  There are monitors available.
[22:18.260 --> 22:22.160]  There are several companies that make light temperature, humidity, CO2 monitors, and a
[22:22.160 --> 22:25.800]  lot of them already include the vapor pressure deficit.
[22:25.800 --> 22:30.560]  So if you see that VPD and you never knew what that was, that is vapor pressure deficit.
[22:30.560 --> 22:34.640]  Now you'll find a lot of great charts online that will show you your ideal vapor pressure
[22:34.640 --> 22:36.400]  deficit range.
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.320]  If you look online for a chart, keep in mind that a lot of those charts are designed for
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.440]  non-cannabis plants.
[22:42.440 --> 22:45.080]  This is going to be very plant specific.
[22:45.080 --> 22:49.000]  I've been running a couple of different devices that show me my vapor pressure deficit.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.560]  I've got multiple grow facilities.
[22:50.560 --> 22:51.560]  I've got a personal grow.
[22:51.560 --> 22:52.600]  I grow for other people.
[22:52.600 --> 22:54.360]  I also visit other grows.
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.640]  I've been paying attention to a Smartbee unit.
[22:56.640 --> 23:00.040]  I've also been paying attention to the PL Grow Systems unit.
[23:00.520 --> 23:06.800]  What I've learned, where I see the plants happiest, in weeks one through two of flower,
[23:06.800 --> 23:12.040]  I like to have a vapor pressure deficit somewhere between eight and 11, which is going to put
[23:12.040 --> 23:17.080]  you at about 77 to 79 degrees with 65 to 75% humidity.
[23:17.080 --> 23:21.000]  Now if you do the equation we talked about earlier, the liquid saturation vapor pressure
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.640]  minus the air saturation vapor pressure times air percent relative humidity, that equation
[23:27.720 --> 23:32.680]  is going to come out to between eight and 11.
[23:32.680 --> 23:37.240]  For weeks one through two, you're looking at a vapor pressure deficit of eight to 11.
[23:37.240 --> 23:40.320]  For weeks three through four, you're going to want to start lowering your humidity a
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.320]  little bit.
[23:41.320 --> 23:42.600]  You're going to want to get a little bit cooler.
[23:42.600 --> 23:48.640]  You're looking for a vapor pressure deficit somewhere between 10 and 13.5.
[23:48.640 --> 23:54.600]  You're going to be at 75 to 77 degrees, and you're looking for 55 to 65% humidity.
[23:54.600 --> 23:57.560]  Now weeks five through nine, we're going to adjust.
[23:57.560 --> 24:00.800]  We're going to go down to about 42 to 50% humidity.
[24:00.800 --> 24:03.440]  You want 74 to 76 degrees.
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.080]  If we do the math equation in those ranges, that is going to bring our vapor pressure
[24:07.080 --> 24:11.400]  deficit to 13 to 15.5.
[24:11.400 --> 24:14.040]  We want it a little cooler and a little drier at the end of flower.
[24:14.040 --> 24:17.560]  We don't want to give it too much moisture because we want to avoid bud rot, and we want
[24:17.560 --> 24:21.520]  to get it a little cooler because that nice cool ending temperature is going to give us
[24:21.520 --> 24:24.360]  some nice sexy colors.
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.040]  Those are the ideal vapor pressure deficit ranges.
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.160]  You're always going to be between 11 and 15.5 seems to be our ideal range.
[24:33.160 --> 24:37.760]  If you don't have anything to measure your vapor pressure deficit, you can measure your
[24:37.760 --> 24:41.760]  relative humidity, and you can measure your temperature, and then you can do the math
[24:41.760 --> 24:46.500]  equation and you can figure out your vapor pressure deficit.
[24:46.500 --> 24:47.580]  Get that dialed in.
[24:47.580 --> 24:52.120]  Once you get it dialed in, you may notice that you can increase the amount of nutrients
[24:52.120 --> 24:53.120]  you're giving your plants.
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.320]  You may actually have to water the plants more frequently.
[24:56.320 --> 25:02.020]  When you get your vapor pressure deficit dialed in, your soil may dry more quickly.
[25:02.020 --> 25:05.020]  You may get a better wet dry cycle from your plants.
[25:05.020 --> 25:07.120]  You're going to have to pay attention to all of these things.
[25:07.120 --> 25:10.100]  It's going to change your growth, but it will be for the better.
[25:10.100 --> 25:15.040]  It's one more thing that we can tweak and dial in and make our plants reach their full
[25:15.040 --> 25:16.040]  potential.
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.960]  All right, you guys, I think I have covered vapor pressure deficit.
[25:19.960 --> 25:22.940]  If I've left you with questions, please contact me.
[25:22.940 --> 25:25.800]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:25.800 --> 25:28.340]  The tweeter is at GFYH podcast.
[25:28.340 --> 25:31.340]  I would love to follow up if I left something out.
[25:31.340 --> 25:35.720]  Now something I want to add, once you guys start implementing all of these little tweaks
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.540]  and tricks and tips that I've given you, you will really start seeing a difference
[25:39.540 --> 25:40.620]  in your garden.
[25:40.620 --> 25:43.260]  You'll start seeing your plants reach their full potential.
[25:43.260 --> 25:48.380]  You will start seeing more potency, bigger weights, which is going to make you more excited
[25:48.380 --> 25:52.020]  about your garden, which is going to make you work even harder in there, which is going
[25:52.100 --> 25:53.820]  to give you even more pride.
[25:53.820 --> 25:57.400]  Once you start implementing all of these little things and then you start seeing results from
[25:57.400 --> 26:01.420]  each little thing, you're going to have more pride and you're going to fall in love even
[26:01.420 --> 26:02.580]  more with your garden.
[26:02.580 --> 26:07.180]  Keep it up, keep going, keep using all these little tricks, and be patient, you guys.
[26:07.180 --> 26:08.420]  You're going to have to dial it in.
[26:08.420 --> 26:12.220]  Every time you dial in one more thing, it's going to get better, but you're also going
[26:12.220 --> 26:14.580]  to find one more thing to dial in.
[26:14.580 --> 26:17.660]  All right, you guys, I want to thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[26:17.660 --> 26:20.840]  It feels like my throat is about to start burning out, so I'm going to start wrapping
[26:20.840 --> 26:22.640]  up this episode.
[26:22.640 --> 26:27.000]  Before I go, I want to give a huge shout out to The Canna Crat, Tyler, Maddie E., and of
