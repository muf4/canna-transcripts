[00:00.000 --> 00:06.280]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:06.280 --> 00:11.480]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 619 of the Grow From Your
[00:11.480 --> 00:12.480]  Heart podcast.
[00:12.480 --> 00:15.680]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few grow questions.
[00:15.680 --> 00:19.840]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:19.840 --> 00:24.840]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:24.840 --> 00:26.200]  level or higher.
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.360]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:29.360 --> 00:31.280]  Thank you shout out to my friend Frankie.
[00:31.280 --> 00:34.320]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Cinti11jr.

[00:51.440 --> 00:54.000]  And let's wrap it up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.800]  Thank you shout out to my friend Jordan Curl.
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.320]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:02.320 --> 01:05.680]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do that,

[01:18.760 --> 01:21.560]  super easy for all of my friends.
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[01:24.600 --> 01:25.800]  Welcome to episode 619.
[01:25.800 --> 01:27.480]  I'm excited for this episode.
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.160]  Let me start off by sending a big thank you to everybody who has joined the IRI Genetics,
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.720]  IRI Army, Grow From Your Heart podcast discord server.
[01:37.720 --> 01:42.000]  We recently reached over 500 members on the discord channel.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Thank you.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  That means a lot to me.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.640]  Big thanks to the gang, the crew that fired up that discord.
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.000]  I am not there enough.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  I hang out a little bit in the discord.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.080]  I've got a lot going on.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.720]  I need to be breeding seeds, packaging seeds, doing podcasts, but you guys are killing it
[01:55.720 --> 01:56.720]  on the discord.
[01:56.960 --> 01:57.960]  I am excited.
[01:57.960 --> 01:58.960]  I am elated.
[01:58.960 --> 01:59.960]  I'm delighted.
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.280]  There are a bunch of words, a bunch of big hallmark sounding words that I want to use
[02:04.280 --> 02:09.200]  to describe how I feel about the way you guys are supporting IRI Genetics, the Grow From
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.000]  Your Heart podcast, all things Rasta Jeff.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.280]  It blows my mind.
[02:13.280 --> 02:14.280]  Thank you.
[02:14.280 --> 02:18.640]  The community that has sprouted from this show, this company, is amazing.
[02:18.640 --> 02:19.640]  It is overwhelming.
[02:19.640 --> 02:20.640]  It's tremendous.
[02:20.640 --> 02:21.640]  It means a lot to me.
[02:21.640 --> 02:23.120]  And I can't stop thanking you enough.
[02:23.120 --> 02:24.440]  So thank you guys.
[02:24.440 --> 02:27.960]  Thank you to the people who created it, the people who sustain it, and the people who
[02:27.960 --> 02:30.440]  just hang out in there and participate.
[02:30.440 --> 02:31.880]  You all mean a lot to me.
[02:31.880 --> 02:34.080]  Big salute to the entire IRI army.
[02:34.080 --> 02:35.080]  All right.
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.160]  What else do I want to talk about before we get to the main part of this email or this
[02:39.160 --> 02:40.320]  episode here?
[02:40.320 --> 02:42.720]  The email part of this episode, excuse the new tongue.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.120]  I'm just getting used to this new face.
[02:44.120 --> 02:46.000]  I'll learn how to talk with it pretty soon here.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.520]  I've only had it for 42 years now.
[02:48.520 --> 02:50.520]  Just getting used to this English thing.
[02:50.520 --> 02:52.220]  I am on another podcast.
[02:52.220 --> 02:57.500]  On Thursdays, occasionally I join the Embracing Organics crew for their podcast.
[02:57.500 --> 02:58.500]  We've got a really nice panel.
[02:58.500 --> 03:03.180]  Shout out to my buddy Dirtman Dan and the entire Embracing Organics crew.
[03:03.180 --> 03:08.020]  But occasionally on Thursdays, I join the crew for an Embracing Organics podcast.
[03:08.020 --> 03:09.500]  The show is on YouTube.
[03:09.500 --> 03:11.820]  It happens live on Thursdays.
[03:11.820 --> 03:17.660]  It goes out, we record approximately 7, 10 PM Mountain Time on Thursdays.
[03:17.660 --> 03:19.540]  The show is live at that time.
[03:19.540 --> 03:21.100]  I'll say the time again.
[03:21.100 --> 03:26.860]  I go on at 7, 10 PM Mountain Time on Thursday on YouTube.
[03:26.860 --> 03:29.060]  Simply search for Embracing Organics.
[03:29.060 --> 03:30.220]  You'll find the show.
[03:30.220 --> 03:34.100]  I am not on every single episode, but I hang out quite often.
[03:34.100 --> 03:38.940]  I try to be there every other episode, but scheduling, life, things are weird.
[03:38.940 --> 03:41.620]  Sometimes they have another guest where I feel like I could just let that guest shine
[03:41.620 --> 03:43.300]  and I don't need to be there.
[03:43.300 --> 03:48.940]  What I'm getting at is on the Embracing Organics show that is coming up on Thursday.
[03:48.980 --> 03:51.620]  I am recording today is the 10th.
[03:51.620 --> 03:53.820]  I believe the show will be on the 11th.
[03:53.820 --> 03:57.740]  By the time this comes out, it will already have happened, but I encourage you to go back
[03:57.740 --> 04:02.820]  and watch it because if all things go correctly, we will be doing an edibles challenge on that
[04:02.820 --> 04:08.540]  show and I will have eaten a ridiculous amount of edibles and I invite you to come hang out,
[04:08.540 --> 04:10.660]  watch the show, see what happened.
[04:10.660 --> 04:12.060]  It hasn't happened yet to be honest.
[04:12.060 --> 04:14.220]  I'm talking to you in the future.
[04:14.220 --> 04:15.420]  The show comes out in the future.
[04:15.420 --> 04:19.220]  I'm talking about another show that's recorded in the future, but I'm pretty sure we're going
[04:19.220 --> 04:20.220]  to have a good time.
[04:20.220 --> 04:22.340]  So I encourage you to check out that show.
[04:22.340 --> 04:23.580]  This will come out Monday.
[04:23.580 --> 04:25.620]  So that show will have already been out for a couple of days.
[04:25.620 --> 04:31.540]  If you have not watched the Embracing Organics Edibles Challenge, I highly suggest you watch
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.540]  that.
[04:32.540 --> 04:33.540]  It's got to be a good time.
[04:33.540 --> 04:36.500]  I've got quite a bit of edibles that I'm going to eat.
[04:36.500 --> 04:38.020]  I might fuck my whole night up.
[04:38.020 --> 04:39.020]  This could be fun.
[04:39.020 --> 04:40.340]  I invite you to come watch.
[04:40.340 --> 04:42.820]  All right, now let's move into something more serious.
[04:42.820 --> 04:45.980]  I've got some emails for this episode.
[04:45.980 --> 04:47.940]  This email came from the Patreon inbox.
[04:47.940 --> 04:51.060]  Of course, if you want your questions answered, Patreon is the quickest way to get them to
[04:51.060 --> 04:55.380]  the top of the list at patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[04:55.380 --> 04:56.980]  This one comes from our friend Tonto.
[04:56.980 --> 04:57.980]  What's up Tonto?
[04:57.980 --> 04:59.260]  Shout out to my buddy up there in Canada.
[04:59.260 --> 05:00.940]  Hope you're doing well.
[05:00.940 --> 05:02.220]  This one goes a lot like this.
[05:02.220 --> 05:03.900]  It says, hello Rasta man.
[05:03.900 --> 05:05.580]  I know you're busy.
[05:05.580 --> 05:10.300]  You know I'm thankful for all you do and I know that your time is valuable.
[05:10.300 --> 05:12.260]  So let's get right to the question.
[05:12.260 --> 05:13.260]  Thank you man.
[05:13.260 --> 05:14.500]  That makes it really easy.
[05:14.500 --> 05:15.500]  Big salute for that one.
[05:15.500 --> 05:19.740]  It says, I believe that I missed a nanner somewhere in my recent crop because my wife
[05:19.740 --> 05:23.120]  and I have found some seeds while trimming.
[05:23.120 --> 05:25.940]  First of all, big shout out to your wife for helping you trim.
[05:25.940 --> 05:29.740]  Trimming sucks and if you can find someone to do it with you, that's a good person.
[05:29.740 --> 05:30.740]  That's a good wife.
[05:30.740 --> 05:32.180]  She deserves a hug and a high five.
[05:32.180 --> 05:36.180]  Buy her some good food and some fancy shoes because she's helping you trim.
[05:36.180 --> 05:37.180]  That's an awesome wife.
[05:37.180 --> 05:38.180]  Shout out to the trim crew.
[05:38.540 --> 05:42.500]  Goes on to say, I don't believe the plants had any pollen sacks as I have shown my wife
[05:42.500 --> 05:45.700]  what to look for in the garden, but not nanners.
[05:45.700 --> 05:48.280]  I'm also not ruling this out either.
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.060]  So our friend thinks that they have found, possibly could have found nanners or missed
[05:53.060 --> 05:56.220]  nanners in their garden because they did find seeds.
[05:56.220 --> 05:58.400]  What do I mean by nanners?
[05:58.400 --> 06:02.540]  Nanners are what we call male flowers that pop up in a female plant.
[06:02.540 --> 06:06.500]  So the plant has got intersex traits or herbaphroditic tendencies.
[06:06.980 --> 06:11.300]  It's a female plant that just showed male sex parts in flower.
[06:11.300 --> 06:14.980]  So a nanner, we call it a banana because it just looks like a little banana that pops
[06:14.980 --> 06:15.980]  up out of your flowers.
[06:15.980 --> 06:19.980]  Oftentimes they come in clusters and it looks like a little bunch of hanging bananas.
[06:19.980 --> 06:21.900]  So we call those a banana.
[06:21.900 --> 06:27.500]  What we are talking about is a male flower or a male flower popping up on a female plant
[06:27.500 --> 06:32.760]  that is now showing us that it is hermaphroditic and that one nanner, that one male flower
[06:32.760 --> 06:37.560]  can produce pollen, which will then produce seeds in our garden.
[06:37.560 --> 06:40.840]  So our buddy Tonto found a few seeds while trimming.
[06:40.840 --> 06:44.160]  He doesn't believe he had any pollen sacks because he's shown his wife what to look for,
[06:44.160 --> 06:46.220]  but she doesn't know to look for nanners.
[06:46.220 --> 06:47.760]  So that is very possible.
[06:47.760 --> 06:49.440]  A lot of things could have caused this.
[06:49.440 --> 06:52.460]  One of the plants could have just stressed out and seeded itself.
[06:52.460 --> 06:54.960]  There could have been pollen from another plant somewhere.
[06:54.960 --> 06:55.960]  One of the plants could have hermed.
[06:55.960 --> 07:00.520]  There are a lot of opportunities to make this happen until you actually look really closely
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.520]  and realize what happened.
[07:01.520 --> 07:06.160]  You'll never know unless you find the nanner, find the pollen chucker, find the light leak,
[07:06.160 --> 07:07.160]  find the issue.
[07:07.160 --> 07:10.400]  It's going to be a big question mark, but here's what we can do.
[07:10.400 --> 07:15.680]  It says, my question is, would these seeds be considered good or would they be untrustworthy?
[07:15.680 --> 07:19.440]  I did a quick Google search, but the results were mainly forum based answers, which are
[07:19.440 --> 07:21.080]  always taken with a grain of salt.
[07:21.080 --> 07:27.480]  That is the way to take any forum answers, social media answers, forum answers, shit.
[07:27.480 --> 07:30.240]  Anything I say should be taken with a grain of salt.
[07:30.960 --> 07:31.960]  Always do your own research.
[07:31.960 --> 07:34.760]  Always realize that those people are doing things their way.
[07:34.760 --> 07:37.720]  Some people may say, oh, you need to spray it with this and do this, but they have no
[07:37.720 --> 07:41.040]  idea what you're doing and their suggestion may fuck you all up.
[07:41.040 --> 07:46.520]  So yes, every piece of advice that you read should be taken with a giant chunk of salt.
[07:46.520 --> 07:53.120]  It goes on to say, I will grow these out regardless, out of pure curiosity, and it is my personal
[07:53.120 --> 07:54.120]  grow.
[07:54.120 --> 07:57.040]  I won't be giving these seeds or plants to anyone out for obvious reasons.
[07:57.040 --> 08:01.560]  God is a man with good ethics, good morals that understands the risks that are available
[08:01.560 --> 08:02.800]  in these seeds.
[08:02.800 --> 08:07.800]  It goes on to say, on a personal note, I wanted to give a shout out to Parkland Flower here
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.560]  in Alberta, Canada.
[08:09.560 --> 08:13.400]  Even though I am unreliable due to my injuries during my service, bro, thank you for your
[08:13.400 --> 08:14.400]  service by the way.
[08:14.400 --> 08:17.540]  You are a service member and we got to give you a big thank you for that, especially since
[08:17.540 --> 08:20.620]  you've been injured providing your Canadian service.
[08:20.620 --> 08:25.600]  It says, they are giving me the opportunity to grow and learn at the commercial level,
[08:25.600 --> 08:28.360]  which I think is such a kind thing to do.
[08:28.360 --> 08:29.400]  That is a beautiful blessing.
[08:29.400 --> 08:31.360]  You are a blessed, lucky man.
[08:31.360 --> 08:36.700]  Embrace that, engage as much as you can, ask a lot of questions, but not too many.
[08:36.700 --> 08:41.120]  Don't try to teach them how you grow your grow, try to learn how they grow theirs.
[08:41.120 --> 08:42.120]  Good job, man.
[08:42.120 --> 08:46.680]  Congratulations and big shout out to our friends at Parkland Flower in Alberta, Canada for
[08:46.680 --> 08:48.960]  giving my buddy Tonto an opportunity.
[08:48.960 --> 08:51.440]  I appreciate that.
[08:51.440 --> 08:54.600]  And dude, use all of the knowledge you've gained here from the podcast in that commercial
[08:54.600 --> 08:56.280]  grow and you will shine.
[08:56.280 --> 09:00.840]  Now let's address the actual question, the issue at hand, the reason this message was
[09:00.840 --> 09:01.880]  sent.
[09:01.880 --> 09:05.560]  Our buddy Tonto has got some seeds that randomly appeared in his garden.
[09:05.560 --> 09:07.280]  He doesn't know if there was a hermaphrodite.
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.960]  He doesn't know if there was a light leak.
[09:08.960 --> 09:10.960]  We don't know what caused these seeds.
[09:10.960 --> 09:13.220]  These seeds will be known as bag seed.
[09:13.220 --> 09:14.220]  This is bag seed.
[09:14.220 --> 09:15.620]  It's questionable seeds.
[09:15.620 --> 09:18.160]  We know what the female plant was because we've got the buds.
[09:18.160 --> 09:19.680]  We can tell you that much of it.
[09:19.680 --> 09:21.560]  We do not know who the pollen donor was.
[09:21.560 --> 09:23.380]  We don't know who the baby daddy is.
[09:23.380 --> 09:25.860]  We got a Mori Povich situation here.
[09:25.860 --> 09:28.900]  So the question is, are these seeds worth the shit?
[09:28.900 --> 09:32.100]  Can I trust them or are they problematic?
[09:32.100 --> 09:34.060]  I don't know.
[09:34.060 --> 09:37.520]  Just as much as you don't know, I don't know what's in those seeds at all.
[09:37.520 --> 09:40.020]  They could be feminized.
[09:40.020 --> 09:41.820]  They could be intersex.
[09:41.820 --> 09:43.700]  They could be beautiful females.
[09:43.700 --> 09:45.260]  They could be amazing mutants.
[09:45.260 --> 09:48.740]  They could be the most amazing fucking flowers you've ever grown.
[09:48.740 --> 09:53.980]  If you think about it, in my opinion, to the best of my knowledge, all of the chemdog
[09:53.980 --> 09:55.860]  lineage was a mistake.
[09:55.860 --> 09:58.020]  Those were seeds that were found in buds.
[09:58.020 --> 10:00.980]  Read about chemdog and the legend of the 13 seeds.
[10:00.980 --> 10:05.420]  You'll realize that a lot of the most popular cannabis we were smoking came from what was
[10:05.420 --> 10:09.500]  known as bag seed, seeds that were accidentally made.
[10:09.500 --> 10:10.700]  Chemdog bought a bag of weed.
[10:10.700 --> 10:11.900]  He found seeds in there.
[10:11.900 --> 10:13.140]  He grew the seeds.
[10:13.140 --> 10:15.940]  Those seeds became the popular chem lines we work with now.
[10:15.940 --> 10:19.660]  1991, ChemD, ChemSister, all came from a bag of weed.
[10:19.660 --> 10:21.540]  They were all bag seed.
[10:21.540 --> 10:26.380]  Those are strains that set the precedent and expectation for the future of cannabis.
[10:26.380 --> 10:31.420]  They changed the world, the landscape of growing, breeding, cannabis production, consumption.
[10:31.420 --> 10:36.020]  Now all people want to talk about is chem and kush because chemdog found those seeds
[10:36.020 --> 10:37.180]  in that bag of weed.
[10:37.180 --> 10:40.860]  So you could have the next chemdog.
[10:40.860 --> 10:42.500]  Golden goat was an accident.
[10:42.500 --> 10:45.780]  Golden goat happened in a very similar manner to what your seeds did.
[10:46.620 --> 10:48.860]  We all know how popular and in demand golden goat is.
[10:48.860 --> 10:51.820]  I think Girl Scout cookies was an accident.
[10:51.820 --> 10:54.300]  Gorilla glue number four was an accident.
[10:54.300 --> 10:58.140]  So there are a lot of things that were bred, created this way.
[10:58.140 --> 11:01.100]  They were accidents and they became stellar products.
[11:01.100 --> 11:08.140]  So you could have some complete bullshit or you could have the next legend in that bag
[11:08.140 --> 11:10.140]  of seeds that you have got there.
[11:10.140 --> 11:11.860]  You're doing it the right way.
[11:11.860 --> 11:12.860]  Don't give them out.
[11:12.860 --> 11:15.680]  Don't let other people have them because they could be problematic.
[11:15.680 --> 11:18.720]  Also don't let other people have them because they could be the fucking gems that make you
[11:18.720 --> 11:20.080]  famous.
[11:20.080 --> 11:21.360]  But you're doing it right.
[11:21.360 --> 11:22.800]  Grow them yourself.
[11:22.800 --> 11:24.640]  Keep a good eye on them while you're growing.
[11:24.640 --> 11:27.960]  Know that you have got big question marks on those seeds.
[11:27.960 --> 11:30.880]  They were free but they could be hermaphrodites.
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.880]  They could be intersex.
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.600]  They could be ticking time bombs or they could be ticking awards.
[11:35.600 --> 11:40.880]  I don't really know what else to other advice to give you because until you grow them, you
[11:40.880 --> 11:41.880]  do not know.
[11:41.880 --> 11:43.760]  That is the beauty of a bag seed.
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.240]  So just like those forum members were saying, it could be anything.
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.520]  And take all of that advice with a grain of salt and again take mine with a grain of salt.
[11:51.520 --> 11:53.320]  There's no way to tell what's in there.
[11:53.320 --> 11:54.560]  They could be amazing.
[11:54.560 --> 11:55.560]  They could be females.
[11:55.560 --> 11:56.560]  They could be males.
[11:56.560 --> 11:58.240]  The way to do it is to grow it out.
[11:58.240 --> 12:01.080]  Pay close attention to it through the entire cycle.
[12:01.080 --> 12:04.880]  Now is when you really have to start learning how to pay attention to nanners.
[12:04.880 --> 12:07.840]  Teach the wife what to look for in intersex plants.
[12:07.840 --> 12:08.840]  Look high.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.840]  Look low.
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.360]  Anytime you stress that plant out, do anything weird to it, watch how it responds.
[12:13.960 --> 12:16.800]  Make sure you don't get any hermaphroditism, any intersex traits.
[12:16.800 --> 12:17.800]  You don't see any nanners.
[12:17.800 --> 12:20.040]  It doesn't go completely weird on you.
[12:20.040 --> 12:24.320]  Also take a lot of pictures of it because you might want to document this because you
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.320]  may have hot fire in there.
[12:26.320 --> 12:28.160]  You may have the next chem dog.
[12:28.160 --> 12:34.200]  You may have the next Girl Scout cookies, golden goat, gorilla glue, OG Tonto's Kush
[12:34.200 --> 12:36.720]  going on in there and we don't even know it yet.
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.440]  So grow those out and see what you've got and take clones when you grow them because
[12:41.600 --> 12:45.480]  if you're growing the most amazing shit ever and you don't have a clone on of it, that
[12:45.480 --> 12:47.440]  is going to be completely heartbreaking.
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.560]  So my buddy Tonto, my advice is grow them, see what you got, get some clones and if they're
[12:51.560 --> 12:53.840]  worth a shit, grow them forever.
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.680]  Then send me a clone if it's hot fire.
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.960]  All right, he wraps it up with, I hope everything coming up for you is iri.
[12:59.960 --> 13:02.160]  Much love from our friend Tonto.
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.240]  Tonto, thank you for the great question.
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.920]  I look forward to seeing what you have created.
[13:06.920 --> 13:07.920]  Did you make fire?
[13:07.920 --> 13:09.520]  Did you make some crazy mutants?
[13:09.520 --> 13:11.440]  Let me know what you've got going on in the garden.
[13:11.440 --> 13:12.840]  I look forward to the update.
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.800]  Also shout out to all my Canadian friends.
[13:14.800 --> 13:17.160]  All right, I do have another question.
[13:17.160 --> 13:19.320]  This one also came from the Patreon.
[13:19.320 --> 13:22.160]  Let's see whose name they want me to use.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.680]  It didn't sign it with the name.
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.800]  So we're going to skip that part.
[13:25.800 --> 13:26.960]  It goes a lot like this.
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.520]  It says, yo, Ross to Jeff, I can't thank you enough for the podcast.
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.360]  You thank me by sending these messages and you thank me every month by contributing to
[13:34.360 --> 13:35.360]  Patreon.
[13:35.360 --> 13:37.080]  So thank you for that continued support.
[13:37.080 --> 13:38.840]  It is a very good exchange.
[13:38.840 --> 13:44.040]  It says, I travel the state of Oklahoma fixing big yellow earth moving equipment.
[13:44.040 --> 13:50.040]  I think I used to be a courier that delivered parts for your big yellow earth moving equipment.
[13:50.040 --> 13:51.720]  Had a bunch of blades and shit in the truck all the time.
[13:51.720 --> 13:53.520]  I used to stop there all the time.
[13:53.520 --> 13:54.520]  Fun job, dude.
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.680]  It says, I clock a lot of miles on the road while listening to the podcast, which has
[13:58.680 --> 14:00.960]  helped my garden tremendously.
[14:00.960 --> 14:04.680]  Isn't that awesome that you can get an education and kill time while you're in the car and
[14:04.680 --> 14:07.080]  then turn around and make your garden look better?
[14:07.080 --> 14:08.080]  That's fucking awesome.
[14:08.320 --> 14:09.840]  I think we're getting paid for those hours too.
[14:09.840 --> 14:10.840]  That'd be super cool.
[14:10.840 --> 14:11.840]  Anyway, it goes on.
[14:11.840 --> 14:19.120]  It says, my question, can you suggest a source for genetics that are in close representation
[14:19.120 --> 14:21.720]  to key cannabis flavors?
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.320]  So let's say I wanted to grow a good cush or other key cannabis.
[14:25.320 --> 14:29.640]  So okay, I kind of stumbled on part of what he's saying here, but you guys are getting
[14:29.640 --> 14:30.640]  the point.
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.760]  I wanted to grow a good cush or other key cannabis flavors, much like you've done with
[14:34.760 --> 14:36.520]  the golden goat strain.
[14:36.520 --> 14:40.200]  So what this person basically wants to do, it says, I want to, where is it?
[14:40.200 --> 14:44.720]  I want to build, I want to smoke and build a palate, much like a sommelier studies their
[14:44.720 --> 14:45.720]  palate for wine.
[14:45.720 --> 14:46.720]  Did I say that word correctly?
[14:46.720 --> 14:48.640]  Because I just read it off the page and I think I got it right.
[14:48.640 --> 14:50.480]  I didn't even study that one.
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.600]  Until legalization, you just got what the guy had.
[14:52.600 --> 14:56.680]  But now with the passion for growing, I'd like to build my palate so that when the bud
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.720]  tender says this is the gassiest gassed or the stinkiest cush, I can know if they're
[15:00.720 --> 15:03.640]  telling the truth or just trying to make a sale.
[15:03.640 --> 15:05.880]  Your golden goat is up next in my garden.
[15:05.880 --> 15:07.500]  Much love and keep it iry.
[15:07.500 --> 15:12.720]  This is a great, interesting question, especially for me, since I talk a lot about turps and
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.300]  flavors and aromas and people tell me that I've got a magical turp nose or that I smell
[15:17.300 --> 15:21.500]  turps and flavors differently, that I taste things a little bit more vividly than a lot
[15:21.500 --> 15:22.500]  of people.
[15:22.500 --> 15:26.140]  We recently discovered that I have got something called synesthesia where I smell and taste
[15:26.140 --> 15:27.300]  in colors.
[15:27.300 --> 15:31.780]  So my palate and my tasting and flavoring thing is vivid and quite more active than
[15:31.780 --> 15:33.340]  a lot of people.
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.660]  So I like this question talking about how to develop your palate and understand the
[15:37.660 --> 15:38.660]  flavors.
[15:38.660 --> 15:43.440]  I thought about how to go about doing this and the only way I can think of doing this
[15:43.440 --> 15:45.760]  is try a lot of samples.
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.240]  This is going to be the fun part.
[15:47.240 --> 15:50.700]  The way that the sommelier gets good with wine is he tries a lot of samples.
[15:50.700 --> 15:54.300]  With the sommelier, he takes a little sip, swishes it around, gets a taste, spits that
[15:54.300 --> 15:55.300]  shit out.
[15:55.300 --> 15:58.780]  The fun part about being the weed sommelier is we're going to take a dab, we're going
[15:58.780 --> 16:01.980]  to smoke a bowl, and we're going to hold that shit in and get the buzz and enjoy it.
[16:02.020 --> 16:03.740]  We don't have to spit it out every time.
[16:03.740 --> 16:07.900]  So the first thing that I would say is smoke a lot of product.
[16:07.900 --> 16:12.820]  You're going to have to travel around to a lot of places and buy a lot of product.
[16:12.820 --> 16:16.420]  Whenever you're, you say you travel around a lot, stop at a dispensary everywhere you
[16:16.420 --> 16:17.700]  go and get something.
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.780]  If you can afford it, I don't know what your budget is, I don't know what you're trying
[16:19.780 --> 16:23.120]  to do, but get as much product as you can get.
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.700]  Just grab an eighth or a gram here and there and make sure they're well labeled.
[16:27.700 --> 16:31.960]  Maybe when you go to the dispensary, get two different products that are vastly different.
[16:31.960 --> 16:34.960]  Get a cushy thing and a bubblegum flavored thing.
[16:34.960 --> 16:37.040]  Or like a Golden Goat and an OG Kush.
[16:37.040 --> 16:38.840]  You got that tropical and that funky.
[16:38.840 --> 16:41.000]  So you can really tell there's a difference.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.280]  This is going to tell you if the dispensary and that Grow has a difference in their product.
[16:45.280 --> 16:48.820]  Because a lot of dispensaries, all their product will taste very similar.
[16:48.820 --> 16:52.440]  So now you've got a guideline on how their product tastes, if it's all similar or if
[16:52.440 --> 16:53.440]  it's different.
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.920]  Then you can smoke those two different products and you can see how does the OG Kush taste.
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.080]  You can kind of say, I bought Jeff's OG at this place, it tastes gassy, cushy, mothballs
[17:03.080 --> 17:04.080]  and swamp.
[17:04.080 --> 17:07.960]  And then I bought Strawberry Starburst at this other place and it tastes just like a
[17:07.960 --> 17:08.960]  Strawberry Starburst.
[17:08.960 --> 17:09.960]  And make notes.
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.400]  Then go to another place and buy another kind of Kush and another fruity thing and make
[17:13.400 --> 17:14.400]  notes on those.
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.600]  And try to just remember when I smoked the strawberry one, it tastes like strawberry
[17:18.600 --> 17:19.600]  bubblegum.
[17:19.600 --> 17:21.840]  When I smoked the OG Kush, it tastes like mothballs.
[17:21.840 --> 17:23.080]  Just develop that palette.
[17:23.080 --> 17:24.680]  Smoke a lot of samples.
[17:24.680 --> 17:25.680]  Smoke a lot of strains.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.320]  But what you're going to have to do is verify that what you're smoking is actually what
[17:30.320 --> 17:31.640]  you think you're smoking.
[17:31.640 --> 17:36.440]  Some dispensaries, anything with the word OG or chem will sell.
[17:36.440 --> 17:40.920]  So if I've got strawberry something and it's not selling, I'm going to put the word strawberry
[17:40.920 --> 17:41.920]  Kush on it.
[17:41.920 --> 17:45.540]  It will sell more quickly and the dispensary will trick you and now your research is kind
[17:45.540 --> 17:46.540]  of tainted.
[17:46.540 --> 17:51.360]  So you're going to have to smoke a lot of samples and develop that palette just by smoking
[17:51.360 --> 17:52.360]  it.
[17:52.360 --> 17:53.360]  That's the way that foodies do it.
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.780]  That's the way that someone does it.
[17:54.880 --> 17:59.860]  It's just a lot of consumption, a lot of memory, a lot of note taking, a lot of experience.
[17:59.860 --> 18:01.020]  Experience builds a lot.
[18:01.020 --> 18:02.660]  Experience is something you can't buy.
[18:02.660 --> 18:07.220]  It's something that you just have to do and that develops a lot of details, a lot of knowledge.
[18:07.220 --> 18:09.620]  The experience will develop your knowledge.
[18:09.620 --> 18:11.440]  So try a lot of samples.
[18:11.440 --> 18:13.660]  Develop that palette for various notes.
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.180]  Look for things.
[18:15.180 --> 18:17.440]  Try to be able to identify gas.
[18:17.440 --> 18:19.400]  You want to be able to smoke gas and fuel.
[18:19.400 --> 18:20.400]  Identify that gas.
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.220]  Everybody wants gas and fuel.
[18:22.220 --> 18:24.520]  Then be able to identify earth.
[18:24.520 --> 18:28.560]  Look for that earthy, dirt, coffee sort of a smell.
[18:28.560 --> 18:31.360]  Be able to identify that in your cannabis.
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.440]  Then be able to identify the fruitier flavors that come from cannabis.
[18:35.440 --> 18:38.920]  You're going to get your strawberries, your blueberries, your oranges.
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.600]  Try to identify that.
[18:40.600 --> 18:44.720]  Then get good at finding the floral notes that come from cannabis.
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.080]  So now you're kind of breaking it into categories.
[18:47.080 --> 18:48.360]  We're getting that earthy stuff.
[18:48.360 --> 18:50.080]  We're getting the gassy stuff.
[18:50.080 --> 18:54.200]  Once you've got categories, then you can kind of say, well, this OG Kush falls in the
[18:54.200 --> 18:55.960]  earthy, gassy category.
[18:55.960 --> 18:59.960]  The Strawberry Starburst was in the berries and floral, maybe a little bit of tropical
[18:59.960 --> 19:01.080]  category.
[19:01.080 --> 19:03.680]  Then you can start kind of making subcategories.
[19:03.680 --> 19:09.160]  Once you get the gas, you can go with chemicals and diesel fuel or regular fuel or cleaners
[19:09.160 --> 19:10.600]  and shit like that.
[19:10.600 --> 19:15.720]  Then once you get earth dialed in, you'll taste like dirt and mud and swamp and moth
[19:15.720 --> 19:20.680]  balls and then you break off into like feet and funky shit like that.
[19:20.680 --> 19:24.080]  Then once you get that fruity palette developed, you'll be able to tell the difference between
[19:24.080 --> 19:27.040]  like oranges and blueberries and strawberries.
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.440]  That's one that'll come natural to you.
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.760]  You're already tasting those things all the time in your life.
[19:31.760 --> 19:33.840]  Everything is flavored with berries and fruits.
[19:33.840 --> 19:38.280]  So those flavors and aromas should be easy to discern and separate and identify.
[19:38.280 --> 19:43.240]  So you got your fruity palette, then that breaks down into like berries, tropicals,
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.580]  and citrus.
[19:45.060 --> 19:48.860]  You're also going to get that floral thing where you're going to get stuff like lavender
[19:48.860 --> 19:52.460]  and lilacs and you're going to get those hints of perfumey things.
[19:52.460 --> 19:57.460]  So basically start finding categories to put flavors into, then find subcategories for
[19:57.460 --> 20:02.540]  those flavors and smoke a lot of shit and see which categories those fall into.
[20:02.540 --> 20:06.820]  You'll make your own kind of bracketing system, your own judging system, and you'll find out
[20:06.820 --> 20:10.440]  how to categorize all this stuff in your head, how to compartmentalize all of your notes
[20:10.440 --> 20:11.560]  in your head.
[20:11.560 --> 20:14.460]  But really just start smoking it with purpose.
[20:14.460 --> 20:16.340]  Pay attention.
[20:16.340 --> 20:20.420]  Have a clean bowl, a clean pipe, or a clean bong, whichever your preferred method is.
[20:20.420 --> 20:21.420]  Clean your damn dab rig.
[20:21.420 --> 20:23.620]  I see a lot of bongs, pipes, and rigs that are filthy.
[20:23.620 --> 20:24.620]  I'm fucking guilty.
[20:24.620 --> 20:27.020]  My dab rig gets so dirty sometimes.
[20:27.020 --> 20:30.020]  But clean that shit up and your product will taste better.
[20:30.020 --> 20:31.140]  You'll just get more flavor out of it.
[20:31.140 --> 20:32.460]  You'll get those turps.
[20:32.460 --> 20:36.020]  So just buy a lot of shit and smoke it, dude.
[20:36.020 --> 20:41.260]  I know that doesn't sound like a real scientific approach, but experience will build your knowledge.
[20:41.260 --> 20:43.740]  So just find the things you want to smoke and smoke them.
[20:43.740 --> 20:47.980]  And then you'll start seeing that things that say kush kind of fall into this kushy bracket.
[20:47.980 --> 20:55.620]  There's like a dirty foot, swampy, mothball, gassy sort of a thing that happens with kush.
[20:55.620 --> 20:59.380]  And then you'll find out that all the diesels have this diesel sort of aroma.
[20:59.380 --> 21:04.740]  You'll find that hazes have sort of a spicy sandalwood, sort of a peppery.
[21:04.740 --> 21:07.560]  Maybe you'll get a lavender smell out of some hazes also.
[21:07.560 --> 21:10.940]  But you'll start finding the commonalities in all of these things.
[21:10.940 --> 21:12.420]  Then you'll start being able to smoke something.
[21:12.420 --> 21:16.220]  You'll take a hit, you'll go, oh man, I could taste the chem dog in that.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.220]  And you'll get there.
[21:17.220 --> 21:18.220]  You'll really get there.
[21:18.220 --> 21:23.140]  Then one day, maybe once you're around it a lot, if you're in different grows exposed
[21:23.140 --> 21:26.020]  to different nutrients and products, you'll take a hit off the joint.
[21:26.020 --> 21:30.660]  You'll go, damn, you guys used way too many worm castings in that.
[21:30.660 --> 21:32.740]  That's the kind of palette that you'll be able to develop in the future.
[21:32.740 --> 21:34.060]  I can taste certain nutrients.
[21:34.060 --> 21:36.740]  I can taste products that were used in the grow.
[21:36.740 --> 21:38.760]  It's all about experience.
[21:38.760 --> 21:43.640]  And you don't know what shit smells like unless you've smelled some shit.
[21:43.640 --> 21:46.760]  So you got to get out in the world and smell things, smell products.
[21:46.760 --> 21:51.240]  When you're at the store, take a minute, just smell the oranges, smell the bananas, smell
[21:51.240 --> 21:52.240]  the watermelons.
[21:52.240 --> 21:55.680]  I know we all think we know what they smell like, but just smell stuff.
[21:55.680 --> 21:58.240]  Just take a time, take a minute and just enjoy things.
[21:58.240 --> 22:02.320]  When you're walking around the flowers, pick up a wildflower, give it a smell.
[22:02.320 --> 22:03.480]  Enjoy that simple stuff.
[22:03.480 --> 22:07.040]  Also when the ladies see you taking a moment to just stop and smell the flowers, they see
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.120]  something in you.
[22:08.480 --> 22:10.720]  They're enjoying and appreciating the world around you.
[22:10.720 --> 22:11.720]  Enjoy that world.
[22:11.720 --> 22:12.720]  Appreciate it.
[22:12.720 --> 22:14.960]  Put your phone away for a moment and smell some stuff.
[22:14.960 --> 22:20.920]  Add that to your arsenal, your repertoire, your memory, your aromatic memory, I guess
[22:20.920 --> 22:23.400]  we're going to call it, your olfactory memory.
[22:23.400 --> 22:27.640]  That way when you smell that in cannabis, you can go, oh, that smells like lilacs or
[22:27.640 --> 22:31.720]  that smells like honeysuckles or that smells like dog poop.
[22:31.720 --> 22:32.720]  Just go smell some stuff.
[22:32.720 --> 22:34.840]  And then you have other things to compare that to.
[22:34.840 --> 22:38.440]  And sorry I sniffled into the microphone when I tried to do that scent thing for you.
[22:38.440 --> 22:41.560]  I got that deviated septum and it's rocking today.
[22:41.560 --> 22:44.320]  Anyway, get us back on track here.
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.080]  The one thing that's going to throw you off is a mislabeled product.
[22:48.080 --> 22:50.040]  That's one thing that'll definitely screw you all up.
[22:50.040 --> 22:54.560]  If you're testing a product that you think is orange cush and it's fucking orange haze
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.720]  and you mark it down in your mental notes as orange cush, you just fucked up all the
[22:57.720 --> 22:58.720]  results.
[22:58.720 --> 23:00.160]  But I think you're going to be okay.
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.160]  You're smart enough.
[23:01.160 --> 23:02.160]  You're human.
[23:02.160 --> 23:05.560]  You can't just test your notes and details and data entry that way.
[23:05.560 --> 23:09.200]  I just wish that people wouldn't do things like that to mess you up.
[23:09.200 --> 23:14.920]  Then there are going to be things like if I had OG cush and you had OG cush and five
[23:14.920 --> 23:18.320]  of our friends had OG cush, there will be variables in that grow.
[23:18.320 --> 23:23.200]  It's going to taste, smell, burn, and affect you a little bit differently based on my environment.
[23:23.200 --> 23:25.320]  That's a phenotypical expression.
[23:25.320 --> 23:28.400]  If my room's a little bit more humid, maybe I'll get stickier buds.
[23:28.400 --> 23:31.140]  If your room's a little drier, maybe you'll get fluffier buds.
[23:31.140 --> 23:33.300]  If my room's warmer, maybe I'll get airier buds.
[23:33.300 --> 23:35.940]  If your room is cooler, maybe you'll get more dense buds.
[23:35.940 --> 23:41.380]  All of these things will have a role on the flavor and effect of that finished product.
[23:41.380 --> 23:47.180]  Also drying and curing will have a huge difference and effect and role on the outcome of that
[23:47.180 --> 23:48.180]  product.
[23:48.180 --> 23:52.340]  If it's not dried and cured and processed properly, the same plant, you can cut buds
[23:52.340 --> 23:56.340]  off of one plant and buds off the same plant, dry one one way and one the other way, they
[23:56.340 --> 23:58.620]  could taste completely differently.
[23:58.860 --> 24:03.220]  Things like that, you'll learn how to taste a proper dry and cure while you're learning
[24:03.220 --> 24:05.220]  to identify different strains.
[24:05.220 --> 24:07.260]  That'll be fun for you.
[24:07.260 --> 24:10.100]  I am looking at my notes to make sure I've covered everything.
[24:10.100 --> 24:15.700]  The bottom line here is experience will develop knowledge, test a lot of samples, and ask
[24:15.700 --> 24:17.340]  a lot of questions.
[24:17.340 --> 24:20.820]  My last note was eat stuff and experience smells.
[24:20.820 --> 24:27.180]  You're going to have to be around non-cannabis things to expand your nose and your mouth
[24:27.180 --> 24:29.780]  palate, your flavor and your aroma palate.
[24:29.780 --> 24:31.380]  Be around things that smell.
[24:31.380 --> 24:36.340]  Go to the zoo, go to the botanical garden, go to the store, go to the farmer's market,
[24:36.340 --> 24:40.580]  go to the farm, be exposed to all types of different smells and aromas.
[24:40.580 --> 24:45.180]  Go to the restaurant, smell the desserts, smell the entrees, just go smell a bunch of
[24:45.180 --> 24:47.980]  things and put ... It's like learning words.
[24:47.980 --> 24:51.060]  Your vocabulary gets better as you're exposed to different words.
[24:51.060 --> 24:52.780]  Your smells will get broader.
[24:52.780 --> 24:56.700]  Your identifications will get better as you're exposed to more smells.
[24:56.700 --> 24:57.700]  All right.
[24:57.700 --> 24:58.700]  Do I have your name?
[24:58.700 --> 25:03.020]  No, I don't think you want me to say your name, so I'm going to skip that.
[25:03.020 --> 25:06.580]  Dude, thank you for the great Patreon message.
[25:06.580 --> 25:07.580]  Let me know how this goes.

[25:10.780 --> 25:14.500]  more, let me know because basically I just told you to go smoke a bunch of weed and smell
[25:14.500 --> 25:19.260]  a bunch of shit, but honestly I feel like that is the way to develop these skills.
[25:19.260 --> 25:23.740]  Hey, I wish you the best of luck in your cannabis sommelier quest.
[25:23.740 --> 25:24.740]  Thank you for the great message.

[26:23.360 --> 26:25.680]  Give me a couple of Mondays to get into the rotation.
