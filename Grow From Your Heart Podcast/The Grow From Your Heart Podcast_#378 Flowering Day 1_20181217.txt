[00:00.000 --> 00:02.160]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.160 --> 00:05.920]  It's time for episode 378 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.920 --> 00:08.640]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.640 --> 00:12.880]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:12.880 --> 00:18.880]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:18.880 --> 00:22.560]  It's usually a tradition that I start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:22.560 --> 00:25.880]  Honestly, today, I feel like total shit and I haven't been dabbing.
[00:25.880 --> 00:27.440]  I'm giving my body a little bit of a rest.
[00:27.440 --> 00:28.440]  I've got a head cold.
[00:28.440 --> 00:29.440]  I've got a chest cold.
[00:29.880 --> 00:32.920]  I've got a sinus thing going on that is driving me completely crazy.
[00:32.920 --> 00:34.760]  So I'm not going to take any dabs before the show.
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.240]  I'm going to try to keep my shit together and deliver you guys a decent podcast.
[00:39.240 --> 00:41.720]  In the last episode, I promised another grow lesson.
[00:41.720 --> 00:45.720]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[00:45.720 --> 00:48.240]  The grow series started at episode 351.
[00:48.240 --> 00:51.880]  If you haven't caught up, I suggest you head back to episode 351.
[00:51.880 --> 00:56.580]  In episode 351, we set a goal for our garden, and then we move on to selecting a space for
[00:56.580 --> 00:57.580]  our garden.
[00:57.580 --> 00:59.160]  We also select the proper equipment.
[00:59.160 --> 01:00.560]  Then we build the grow room.
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.400]  Then we talk about seeds and clones.
[01:02.400 --> 01:03.680]  Then we veg our plants.
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.040]  Then we talk about a few tricks and tips to get our plants up to speed for quality production.
[01:08.040 --> 01:11.760]  At this point in my grow lessons, it is day one of flower.
[01:11.760 --> 01:18.200]  It is time to flip our crop from the vegetative phase into the flowering phase of our grow.
[01:18.200 --> 01:19.480]  I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[01:19.480 --> 01:22.520]  I'm going to listen back to this intro and see how I sound.
[01:22.520 --> 01:27.080]  When I come back, we are going to talk about flowering our new cannabis garden.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.520]  All right, podcast world.
[01:28.520 --> 01:31.640]  I apologize that I do sound kind of crappy, but the show must go on.
[01:31.640 --> 01:33.240]  I've been promising this episode.
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.840]  I may make this one kind of quick and then recap next week and move forward.
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.600]  My original idea was to do a three-week chunk of flowering episodes.
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.640]  We would do week one through three, and then four through six, and seven through nine.
[01:45.640 --> 01:49.600]  But we are going to focus on day one of week one today, and then we will adjust from there
[01:49.600 --> 01:51.880]  in the following episodes.
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.040]  Let's get started on flowering our cannabis garden.
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.420]  What do I mean by flowering?
[01:56.420 --> 01:59.140]  We want to initiate the budding phase.
[01:59.140 --> 02:04.340]  The flowering phase for regular cannabis plants is triggered by reducing the light cycle.
[02:04.340 --> 02:08.620]  If you were working with auto flower plants, you were in a total different ballgame.
[02:08.620 --> 02:11.100]  Those plants will flower when they are ready.
[02:11.100 --> 02:15.460]  For this discussion, we're going to focus on regular photo period plants and photo period
[02:15.460 --> 02:16.460]  seeds.
[02:16.460 --> 02:19.820]  So let's talk about flowering our photo period garden.
[02:19.820 --> 02:21.220]  Initiating flower is very easy.
[02:21.220 --> 02:25.780]  All we do is reduce the timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[02:26.140 --> 02:31.900]  We need 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness every day to trigger these plants to flower.
[02:31.900 --> 02:34.940]  I've said it several times, but I'm going to repeat myself.
[02:34.940 --> 02:40.540]  We need total uninterrupted darkness during the night phase for our flowering plants.
[02:40.540 --> 02:42.740]  A little bit of light is too much.
[02:42.740 --> 02:47.420]  If you can see a pinprick of light coming in that room, it is too much light.
[02:47.420 --> 02:51.220]  If you can see your hand in front of your face during the dark phase in that room, it
[02:51.220 --> 02:52.500]  is too much light.
[02:52.500 --> 02:54.340]  Those plants know that that light is there.
[02:54.340 --> 02:56.100]  They will not go to sleep properly.
[02:56.100 --> 02:57.780]  They will not flower properly.
[02:57.780 --> 03:01.900]  If they do try to flower properly, you give them the chance of hermaphroditing on you
[03:01.900 --> 03:06.460]  in mid flower, which will produce seeds in your garden, which will ruin your whole goal.
[03:06.460 --> 03:11.740]  So we need 100% total darkness in our flowering room during the night phase.
[03:11.740 --> 03:13.700]  So switch the timer to 1212.
[03:13.700 --> 03:16.740]  Be sure that you have got total dark in that dark phase.
[03:16.740 --> 03:18.120]  You need to go in there and look.
[03:18.120 --> 03:22.400]  You probably need to hang out in the grow room for about 15 to 20 minutes for your eyes
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.840]  to adjust properly to identify the most minimal light leaks you could possibly have.
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.160]  So go in there and check for light leaks on day one of flower.
[03:31.160 --> 03:34.040]  If you have any light coming in, you need to correct that.
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.200]  That will ruin your garden.
[03:36.200 --> 03:38.000]  So we've set the timer to 1212.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.120]  Now it is on for 12 hours a day and it is off for 12 hours a day.
[03:42.120 --> 03:45.520]  Put a lot of thought into the hours which your lights run.
[03:45.520 --> 03:48.440]  Do you want those lights to come on in the morning when you wake up so you can water
[03:48.440 --> 03:51.840]  the plants before you go to work and then the plants are on all day while you're gone
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.840]  at work?
[03:52.840 --> 03:55.600]  Hopefully you get to come home and check them out before the lights turn off.
[03:55.600 --> 03:59.240]  Or do you want those lights to come on in the evening right when you get home from work
[03:59.240 --> 04:02.640]  and the lights can run all night while you're home and you can check on everything?
[04:02.640 --> 04:04.440]  Maybe you can get up before work and they're still on.
[04:04.440 --> 04:07.320]  You can check on them again before you go to work and make sure everything's cool.
[04:07.320 --> 04:11.000]  I would put a lot of thought into scheduling my flowering cycle.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.340]  Another thing to consider while you're planning your schedule is electricity is cheaper during
[04:15.340 --> 04:17.080]  off-peak hours.
[04:17.080 --> 04:20.920]  That means that during the evenings when everybody goes home and they're chilling, electricity
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.160]  gets cheaper.
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.160]  During the daytime business hours when everybody's using all of the electricity, the electric
[04:26.160 --> 04:29.420]  company does charge you more for those peak hours.
[04:29.420 --> 04:33.880]  What many folks will choose to do is run those lights during off-peak hours and save money
[04:33.880 --> 04:35.180]  on electricity.
[04:35.180 --> 04:38.800]  This is also advantageous because it is cooler during the evenings.
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.560]  You don't have the sun up keeping your grow room extra hot.
[04:41.560 --> 04:44.820]  You're not heating the outside with the sun and the inside with the grow lights.
[04:44.820 --> 04:46.920]  The sun goes down and gets a little cooler outside.
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.600]  You can use that cool outside air to your advantage and keep the grow room cool.
[04:51.600 --> 04:53.000]  Think about your scheduling.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.860]  When do you want that 12-12 on cycle to be?
[04:55.860 --> 04:58.880]  When do you want that 12-12 off cycle to be?
[04:58.880 --> 05:03.920]  If you do decide to run your lights at night and have your dark cycle during the natural
[05:03.920 --> 05:10.240]  light cycle, be sure that no sunshine is creeping into your grow room during that night cycle.
[05:10.240 --> 05:12.000]  Again, we need total darkness.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.760]  A very common mistake is that people flower their plants at night, which means they're
[05:15.760 --> 05:20.040]  in the sleep cycle during the day, which means there's the opportunity for the sunshine
[05:20.040 --> 05:21.480]  to sneak into your grow room.
[05:21.480 --> 05:25.780]  If you've got a window, if you've got a doorway, if you've got some kind of insecure structure,
[05:25.780 --> 05:29.480]  you can get light in there very easily and it will destroy your crop.
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.620]  You've thought about scheduling and you know how it's going to work around your work schedule.
[05:32.620 --> 05:34.100]  You know how it's going to work around your life.
[05:34.100 --> 05:35.840]  You know when you're going to flower these plants.
[05:35.840 --> 05:39.680]  You know when you'll have time to give them maintenance and work on them and water them.
[05:39.680 --> 05:41.380]  Plan your scheduling around that.
[05:41.380 --> 05:43.480]  We have set the timer to 12-12.
[05:43.480 --> 05:45.540]  That is day one of flower.
[05:45.540 --> 05:48.620]  That first short day is day one.
[05:48.620 --> 05:49.980]  Write that day down.
[05:49.980 --> 05:53.340]  Too many people forget to write that down and they don't know how long their plants
[05:53.340 --> 05:54.860]  have been in flower.
[05:54.860 --> 05:58.460]  Write down your flowering start date.
[05:58.460 --> 06:02.020]  Another thing I want to make clear is, this is day one of flower.
[06:02.020 --> 06:07.380]  If you've got a package of seeds and it says, takes 70-80 days to flower, this is the first
[06:07.380 --> 06:11.100]  day of that 70-80 days of that finishing time.
[06:11.100 --> 06:15.940]  A lot of folks like to start the flowering phase when they see bud set starting, when
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.340]  they see pre-flowers.
[06:17.340 --> 06:21.380]  You are 12 days into flower by then and you are ripping yourself off.
[06:21.380 --> 06:25.220]  Flowering starts the day we change the timer to 12-12.
[06:25.220 --> 06:26.980]  That is day one of flower.
[06:26.980 --> 06:28.800]  So we've now switched the timer to 12-12.
[06:28.800 --> 06:32.280]  The plants will be on for 12 hours a day and off for 12 hours.
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.700]  They're going to start flowering.
[06:33.700 --> 06:38.280]  Let's talk about the environmental conditions we need to provide for our flowering plants
[06:38.280 --> 06:40.380]  here at the beginning of flower.
[06:40.380 --> 06:42.620]  This will change as the plants progress.
[06:42.620 --> 06:44.660]  Right now we don't have any buds to worry about.
[06:44.660 --> 06:48.660]  There are much less opportunities for mildew and molds to take hold because when you get
[06:48.660 --> 06:52.660]  those chunky buds, the mildew likes to start in the middle of those buds.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.160]  That's not really a worry right now.
[06:54.160 --> 06:56.220]  So we can have the humidity a little higher at this point.
[06:56.220 --> 06:58.340]  We can have the temps a little higher at this point.
[06:58.340 --> 07:02.080]  But as we progress, we are going to lower the humidity and the temperature in our flowering
[07:02.080 --> 07:06.220]  room to accommodate those big chunky buds and to prevent problems.
[07:06.220 --> 07:11.660]  So at this phase of the game, it would be ideal to have your grow room between 70 and
[07:11.660 --> 07:13.340]  80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[07:13.340 --> 07:15.100]  I do not recommend higher than 80.
[07:15.100 --> 07:17.340]  I do not recommend lower than 70.
[07:17.340 --> 07:20.060]  I understand that you're struggling to keep your room cool.
[07:20.060 --> 07:23.340]  A lot of new growers have issues keeping the grow room cool.
[07:23.340 --> 07:26.380]  84 is the max you ever want to hit.
[07:26.380 --> 07:30.220]  When you hit 85 degrees and higher, your plants will stop producing.
[07:30.220 --> 07:34.240]  They will just go into a stagnant, dead, slowed down mode.
[07:34.240 --> 07:37.520]  How productive do you want to be when it's 110 degrees outside?
[07:37.520 --> 07:38.520]  You just feel like shit.
[07:38.520 --> 07:39.520]  You don't want to do anything.
[07:39.520 --> 07:40.520]  You don't want to move.
[07:40.520 --> 07:41.960]  The plants feel the same way.
[07:41.960 --> 07:44.040]  The plants can't move themselves to some shade.
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.080]  The plants can't grab some water and take a drink.
[07:46.080 --> 07:47.440]  Those plants are stuck there.
[07:47.440 --> 07:49.520]  So give them the proper environment.
[07:49.520 --> 07:50.560]  Don't go too hot.
[07:50.560 --> 07:51.960]  Don't go too cold.
[07:51.960 --> 07:57.400]  At this phase of the flowering cycle, I would recommend 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit during
[07:57.400 --> 07:59.760]  your lights on cycle.
[07:59.760 --> 08:03.200]  Now let's talk a little bit about the humidity of this grow room.
[08:03.200 --> 08:08.200]  During the start of the flowering phase, I like to have about 40 to 50% humidity.
[08:08.200 --> 08:10.600]  Earlier I said we don't have those big buds to worry about.
[08:10.600 --> 08:12.440]  So we've just got a bunch of lush, happy plants.
[08:12.440 --> 08:15.920]  They're just in there sucking up all that humidity and growing like crazy.
[08:15.920 --> 08:22.640]  So 40 to 50% relative humidity and 70 to 80 degrees during your daytime cycle.
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.860]  If you really want to dial that in, I recommend you check out my episode about vapor pressure
[08:26.860 --> 08:27.960]  deficit.
[08:27.960 --> 08:29.780]  And that was episode number 314.
[08:29.780 --> 08:33.300]  If you're interested in learning more about the vapor pressure deficit, which I find to
[08:33.300 --> 08:38.140]  be very important when it comes to dialing in the grow room perfectly, VPD will really
[08:38.140 --> 08:43.340]  improve the productivity of your plants if you understand it and dial it in correctly.
[08:43.340 --> 08:44.760]  So that is the daytime condition.
[08:44.760 --> 08:49.300]  We want 70 to 80 degrees during the day, 40 to 50% relative humidity.
[08:49.300 --> 08:51.340]  Let's talk about the nighttime temperatures.
[08:51.340 --> 08:54.540]  When we turn off the light, things are going to change in that grow room.
[08:54.540 --> 08:57.900]  I try to keep the humidity right around the same levels at nighttime at this stage of
[08:57.900 --> 08:58.900]  flowering.
[08:59.020 --> 09:02.340]  So 40 to 50% humidity during the night cycle.
[09:02.340 --> 09:05.460]  Now during the night cycle, I like it to get a little bit cooler.
[09:05.460 --> 09:07.180]  It naturally cools off at night.
[09:07.180 --> 09:11.220]  So I feel like the plants probably enjoy a little bit cooler of a temperature at night.
[09:11.220 --> 09:17.220]  I try not to go any more than 10 degrees difference on a day and night temperature.
[09:17.220 --> 09:19.620]  That is called your diurnal temperature variation.
[09:19.620 --> 09:22.640]  And you don't want that to sway more than 10 degrees.
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.180]  So if during your day cycle, you're at 75, you do not want your night cycle to get any
[09:27.180 --> 09:30.220]  lower than 65 degrees.
[09:30.220 --> 09:34.520]  I would generally try to keep it about five degrees difference, but I understand we're
[09:34.520 --> 09:35.820]  building new grow rooms.
[09:35.820 --> 09:37.020]  We are learning our setups.
[09:37.020 --> 09:39.020]  We are learning to dial these rooms in.
[09:39.020 --> 09:43.600]  Five to 10 degrees is acceptable for a diurnal temperature variation.
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.960]  But if you go any more than five to 10 degrees differential in your day and night temperature,
[09:47.960 --> 09:50.160]  you will cause problems within the plants.
[09:50.160 --> 09:51.540]  The plants will be confused.
[09:51.540 --> 09:53.080]  The plants will begin to grow slowly.
[09:53.080 --> 09:56.300]  And this is also a great way to invite powdery mildew.
[09:56.420 --> 10:01.140]  So try to keep your temperature swings within 10 degrees from your day and nighttime temperature.
[10:01.140 --> 10:04.900]  Now when you're walking through the grow, sometimes just reach out and grab a plant
[10:04.900 --> 10:06.980]  and feel the temperature of the plant.
[10:06.980 --> 10:08.140]  Is the plant warm?
[10:08.140 --> 10:09.140]  Is the plant cold?
[10:09.140 --> 10:11.200]  How does the plant feel to your hands?
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.000]  If the plants feel really, really cold, they're probably really cold and you could probably
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.040]  increase the temperature of your room.
[10:17.040 --> 10:19.680]  If the plants feel like they're warm, they're probably warm.
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.940]  You can probably lower the temperature of your room.
[10:22.940 --> 10:26.920]  In the future, I do plan to do a discussion on leaf surface temperature versus ambient
[10:26.920 --> 10:29.100]  room temperature, but we are not there yet.
[10:29.100 --> 10:30.760]  So let's stay focused here.
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.640]  Now one thing I may have overlooked when I talked about equipment is a hygrometer and
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.860]  a thermometer or some sort of a monitoring device to know what is happening in our grow
[10:39.860 --> 10:42.080]  room at all times.
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.400]  Most of us growers can probably afford the hygrometer thermometer combo that sits in
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.640]  the grow room and it marks the humidity and temperature of the room, but it will also
[10:50.640 --> 10:54.100]  mark the highest and lowest points of your humidity and temperature.
[10:54.100 --> 10:57.940]  So you can find your peaks and your valleys and identify the temperature and humidity
[10:57.940 --> 10:59.940]  fluctuations in your room.
[10:59.940 --> 11:03.500]  It's always nice to know where the peaks and valleys are, but I like to have more data.
[11:03.500 --> 11:07.300]  I like to have something in the room that can tell me what's going on at all times.
[11:07.300 --> 11:10.880]  For a reliable monitor that can keep you up to date on what's happening in your grow room
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.740]  at all times, I would suggest something like a PO Grow Systems Minder Unit or perhaps a
[11:15.740 --> 11:17.420]  Smart Bee Unit.
[11:17.420 --> 11:20.800]  You can use both of those units to monitor your grow room at all times.
[11:20.800 --> 11:22.580]  You can pull up the data on your phone.
[11:22.580 --> 11:25.380]  You can see what's happening in the room in real time.
[11:25.380 --> 11:28.920]  Some of these types of units allow you to actually plug in other devices and trigger
[11:28.920 --> 11:30.360]  them from your smartphone.
[11:30.360 --> 11:34.440]  So if you were away, you open up your application, you see that it's too warm in that room, you
[11:34.440 --> 11:36.680]  can say, Hey, let's just easily turn on the air conditioner.
[11:36.680 --> 11:40.120]  You can click a button on a tab on your phone and it will fire up the air conditioner in
[11:40.120 --> 11:44.160]  your grow room and you can rescue your garden while you're at lunch, hanging out with your
[11:44.160 --> 11:46.700]  friends and you don't even have to leave the table.
[11:46.700 --> 11:50.980]  So my point is, have some way to monitor the temperature and humidity in your grow
[11:50.980 --> 11:52.160]  room at all times.
[11:52.160 --> 11:55.340]  I like to have a report of what happens when those lights go off.
[11:55.340 --> 11:58.120]  You have been running that grow light for 12 hours in that room.
[11:58.120 --> 11:59.300]  You have created a lot of heat.
[11:59.300 --> 12:00.980]  You have created a lot of energy.
[12:00.980 --> 12:03.940]  All of that heat, all of that light energy has created humidity.
[12:03.940 --> 12:05.780]  There's water rising up in the air.
[12:05.780 --> 12:08.100]  Now when we kill that light, everything changes.
[12:08.100 --> 12:10.800]  All of that humidity in the air is no longer being heated.
[12:10.800 --> 12:12.520]  It's got the opportunity to start falling.
[12:12.520 --> 12:14.580]  It becomes kind of thick in the grow room.
[12:14.580 --> 12:19.660]  That short time period while the room stabilizes itself out from that change is quite often
[12:19.660 --> 12:24.660]  the cause of many of our powdery mildew and boitritis issues.
[12:24.660 --> 12:28.060]  Many growers don't even know that that is happening in the room at that time.
[12:28.060 --> 12:31.980]  They look at their hygrometer, they look at their thermometer, they say, oh, it was 72
[12:31.980 --> 12:32.980]  degrees in here.
[12:32.980 --> 12:33.980]  That's acceptable.
[12:33.980 --> 12:35.700]  Oh, it was 45% humidity in here.
[12:35.700 --> 12:36.700]  That's acceptable.
[12:36.700 --> 12:42.180]  You don't realize that there was a point where it was 78 degrees and about 82% humidity in
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.180]  the room.
[12:43.180 --> 12:44.740]  That's because we turned off that light.
[12:44.740 --> 12:47.020]  All that moisture that was in the air is now falling.
[12:47.020 --> 12:50.540]  Now the plants don't have light anymore, so they are starting to respirate a little bit.
[12:50.540 --> 12:52.500]  They're letting out a little more moisture.
[12:52.500 --> 12:57.020]  All of that chaos can really cause problems for our plants in that type of environment.
[12:57.020 --> 13:02.620]  My point is, try to know what's happening environmentally in your rooms at all times.
[13:02.620 --> 13:05.300]  It feels like we know what our environment should be like.
[13:05.300 --> 13:09.740]  Let's talk a little bit about feeding our transitioning cannabis plants.
[13:09.740 --> 13:13.500]  If you are working in a no-till bed or you're working with super soil, there's no need to
[13:13.500 --> 13:15.320]  adjust anything at this time.
[13:15.320 --> 13:16.500]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[13:16.500 --> 13:20.340]  You basically need to water the plants throughout the flowering cycle.
[13:20.340 --> 13:24.460]  If you plan on adding a cover crop or a top dress or maybe feeding some teas, you will
[13:24.460 --> 13:26.940]  need to adjust your teas at this time.
[13:26.940 --> 13:31.420]  I would take the nitrogen products out and focus more on the phosphorus and potassium
[13:31.420 --> 13:35.500]  at this time if you're running teas or top dress or a cover crop.
[13:35.500 --> 13:39.700]  Now if you are working with bottled nutrients, you can probably just swap out that veg bottle
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.780]  and replace it with the flowering nutrients.
[13:42.780 --> 13:47.340]  Most of the bottled nutrient companies make it very easy to follow their nutrient schedule.
[13:47.340 --> 13:51.060]  So simply swap out that veg bottle, put in the bloom bottle, and everything should be
[13:51.060 --> 13:52.460]  good to go.
[13:52.460 --> 13:56.000]  The main difference in our feeding schedule at this time is that we are going to reduce
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.500]  the amount of nitrogen and we are going to slowly start increasing the amount of phosphorus
[14:00.500 --> 14:02.140]  and potassium.
[14:02.140 --> 14:07.380]  Our plants take up approximately 80-90% of their nitrogen during the veg phase.
[14:07.380 --> 14:11.180]  Once we switch them into flower, they are done sucking up nitrogen and they want more
[14:11.180 --> 14:16.300]  phosphorus and potassium so they can build robust branches and big fat buds.
[14:16.300 --> 14:20.900]  So let's reduce the nitrogen and start increasing the phosphorus and potassium.
[14:20.900 --> 14:24.600]  That part should mostly be covered by your base nutrients.
[14:24.600 --> 14:28.420]  If you're running a one bottled base nutrient, a two part or a three part, you should be
[14:28.420 --> 14:33.780]  getting the proper nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from your base nutrients.
[14:33.780 --> 14:36.940]  Now there are a few more things that these plants can use at this phase.
[14:36.940 --> 14:38.540]  I like to add silica.
[14:38.540 --> 14:42.540]  When I am mixing up my nutrient solution, I always put potassium silicates in the water
[14:42.540 --> 14:43.540]  first.
[14:43.540 --> 14:45.740]  The potassium silicates go first.
[14:45.740 --> 14:47.960]  Then I mix in my base nutrients.
[14:47.960 --> 14:50.980]  These plants can probably use cow mag at this point in time.
[14:50.980 --> 14:55.180]  I also like to give the plants some sort of a root inoculant early in flower.
[14:55.180 --> 14:56.620]  Don't cut back the microbes.
[14:56.620 --> 14:57.620]  Keep them going.
[14:57.620 --> 14:59.060]  Keep those roots growing strong.
[14:59.060 --> 15:00.060]  Keep them healthy.
[15:00.060 --> 15:02.460]  The plants will continue to flourish in flower.
[15:02.460 --> 15:04.120]  I also like some enzymes.
[15:04.120 --> 15:06.940]  Those enzymes serve several purposes.
[15:06.940 --> 15:10.560]  The enzymes will basically help to keep the root zone clean, and they will also break
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.480]  down any decaying root matter and turn that into usable energy for my plants.
[15:15.480 --> 15:17.500]  I also like to add some carbohydrates.
[15:17.500 --> 15:20.080]  The carbohydrates serve a couple of purposes.
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.360]  Those carbs will feed my microbes.
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.040]  Those carbs will also give my plants energy.
[15:25.040 --> 15:29.560]  Between the carbs, the enzymes, and the mycos, my root zone is really healthy and really
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.520]  active which will show up top at the top of our plants.
[15:33.600 --> 15:37.360]  We are focusing on nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at this stage.
[15:37.360 --> 15:41.000]  We are shifting away from the nitrogen more toward the phosphorus and potassium.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.160]  It's always good to add cow mag, a little bit of a root inoculant.
[15:44.160 --> 15:47.160]  I like some enzymes, always some carbs.
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.000]  To make everything pop, I would add a little bit of fulvic acid.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.120]  If you've chosen to work with a specific bottled nutrient company, most of those companies
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.840]  have a nutrient calculator on their website.
[15:57.840 --> 16:00.480]  You can go to whatevernutrientcompany.com.
[16:00.480 --> 16:02.400]  You can find their nutrient calculator.
[16:02.400 --> 16:04.760]  You can type in how many weeks you're going to flower.
[16:04.760 --> 16:08.380]  You can click on which products of theirs you have purchased and it will tell you week
[16:08.380 --> 16:12.160]  by week how much of each product to use.
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.080]  Most of those charts are reliable, but keep in mind, they want you to continue buying
[16:16.080 --> 16:22.360]  products so they may recommend you use a little more than necessary for an ideal crop situation.
[16:22.360 --> 16:27.960]  I generally reduce the recommended dosage by about 25%.
[16:27.960 --> 16:34.920]  If it says to feed 100ml of your base product, I would start off with 75ml and see what happens.
[16:34.920 --> 16:38.660]  We can always feed the plants a little more later, but we can never take out the feeding
[16:38.660 --> 16:39.880]  once we've put it in.
[16:39.880 --> 16:41.480]  So don't burn the plants.
[16:41.480 --> 16:45.900]  Wait for them to show you that they are happy or that they are angry and adjust from there.
[16:45.900 --> 16:50.280]  Most of these nutrient companies offer a fairly balanced diet within their own product line.
[16:50.280 --> 16:53.840]  You shouldn't have to reach out to another brand or another company and fill in anything
[16:53.840 --> 16:55.360]  that they are missing.
[16:55.360 --> 17:01.780]  If you do choose to mix nutrient lines, be very careful that you don't double up on anything.
[17:01.780 --> 17:05.760]  When Nutrient Company A made their product lines, they made 5 bottles and they put the
[17:05.760 --> 17:09.720]  base newts in one, they put the cow mag in the other, they put the humic acid in another,
[17:09.720 --> 17:11.400]  and a bloom booster in another.
[17:11.400 --> 17:14.760]  They know what is in each bottle and they can recommend your feeding because they know
[17:14.760 --> 17:18.760]  they're not going to overdose anything with their design.
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.400]  When you introduce a product from another company, you run the risk of doubling up on
[17:23.400 --> 17:25.520]  specific nutrients.
[17:25.520 --> 17:30.160]  Nutrient Company A and Nutrient Company B did not talk to each other about their designs.
[17:30.160 --> 17:34.280]  So you may be running a base product from Nutrient Company A, then you may have a bloom
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.120]  booster from Nutrient Company B. Those companies didn't talk.
[17:38.120 --> 17:41.960]  Company A was putting cow mag inside their base nutrient to help you out and save you
[17:41.960 --> 17:43.320]  with the bottle.
[17:43.320 --> 17:47.040]  Company B was putting the cow mag inside the bloom booster to help you out and save a bottle
[17:47.040 --> 17:48.040]  and you didn't know that.
[17:48.040 --> 17:52.520]  So now you just fed 2 doses of cow mag because you combined nutrient companies and didn't
[17:52.640 --> 17:53.640]  read the bottles.
[17:53.640 --> 17:58.440]  So if you choose to use products from 2 different companies, be sure not to overlap with any
[17:58.440 --> 17:59.440]  nutrients.
[17:59.440 --> 18:02.720]  If you know what's in each product and you understand how the plants use each of those
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.560]  products and you're not going to cause any problems, there is nothing wrong with combining
[18:06.560 --> 18:08.360]  nutrient companies.
[18:08.360 --> 18:11.880]  If you feel like the brand you were using is lacking something, feel free to purchase
[18:11.880 --> 18:16.720]  another product from another company and add that into your mix as long as you don't double
[18:16.720 --> 18:18.840]  up any specific elements.
[18:18.840 --> 18:22.300]  A good example of what I'm talking about is, in a commercial environment, I like to run
[18:22.300 --> 18:24.700]  Vegebloom powder nutrients.
[18:24.700 --> 18:29.220]  In my opinion, Vegebloom could use a little bit of fulvic acid added to the mix.
[18:29.220 --> 18:33.560]  In my opinion, Vegebloom can use a little bit of carbohydrates added to the mix later
[18:33.560 --> 18:34.600]  in flour.
[18:34.600 --> 18:37.700]  So I am comfortable adding those products and I've done my research.
[18:37.700 --> 18:42.380]  I know how much carbs, I know how much fulvic acid is in my starting product, so I know
[18:42.380 --> 18:44.460]  that I'm not going to overdose my plants.
[18:44.460 --> 18:47.100]  Alright, I'm confident that we understand the environment.
[18:47.100 --> 18:49.860]  I'm confident that we understand what to feed the plants.
[18:49.860 --> 18:53.900]  Let's talk about some more techniques to do at the very start of flour.
[18:53.900 --> 19:00.380]  If you are using sprayed pesticide applications, now is a great time to apply a pesticide application.
[19:00.380 --> 19:02.620]  We are running out of time for sprays.
[19:02.620 --> 19:06.580]  We are going to start developing bud sites very soon, so we need to treat these plants
[19:06.580 --> 19:07.980]  today.
[19:07.980 --> 19:12.340]  Let's apply a preventative product to our plants to ensure we do not get any pests in
[19:12.340 --> 19:13.920]  our veg cycle.
[19:13.920 --> 19:17.820]  If you are not going to use spray pesticide applications, now is a good time to release
[19:17.820 --> 19:19.220]  your beneficial insects.
[19:19.220 --> 19:24.540]  We want to get them colonized and built up in the grow before other insects have an opportunity
[19:24.540 --> 19:26.820]  to take hold in our flowering garden.
[19:26.820 --> 19:31.020]  Once the plants are flowering, we don't have a lot of options for pest control, so let's
[19:31.020 --> 19:37.260]  do everything we can now to prevent a pest infestation while we have big chunky buds.
[19:37.260 --> 19:39.900]  So I would treat for pests at this time.
[19:39.900 --> 19:42.780]  Spray pesticides if that is your approach.
[19:42.780 --> 19:46.220]  Another thing I like to do on day one of flour is trellis my plants.
[19:46.220 --> 19:51.020]  In a commercial environment, I am not able to move my veg plants into a room and trellis
[19:51.020 --> 19:52.020]  them.
[19:52.020 --> 19:53.900]  I have a veg room and I have flowering rooms.
[19:53.900 --> 19:58.180]  The flowering rooms are constantly flowering, so I can't veg in that room.
[19:58.180 --> 20:02.780]  So I move the plants into the flowering area and I put the trellis up on day one.
[20:02.780 --> 20:07.080]  And I bend and pop and work those plants into the net on day one.
[20:07.080 --> 20:11.820]  This gives them plenty of time to recover from the stress of getting beat up while they
[20:11.820 --> 20:14.020]  transition to the flowering phase.
[20:14.020 --> 20:16.780]  We've got about seven to 10 days where they're just transitioning.
[20:16.780 --> 20:17.860]  There won't be any bud growth.
[20:17.860 --> 20:19.460]  There won't be any major activity.
[20:19.460 --> 20:22.980]  So if we beat them up on day one, we've got plenty of time to recover.
[20:22.980 --> 20:25.420]  So I like to get in there and get them under the trellis.
[20:25.420 --> 20:30.060]  I also do popping and twisting, which is also known as super cropping.
[20:30.060 --> 20:33.940]  I've talked about this in depth in other episodes, but I'll give you a quick rundown.
[20:33.940 --> 20:38.120]  I start at the very bottom stalk of the plant where it comes out of the dirt.
[20:38.120 --> 20:40.540]  I grab the base of the stalk with my left hand.
[20:40.540 --> 20:46.500]  I put my right hand above that and I grab the stalk and I twist my right hand counterclockwise.
[20:46.500 --> 20:48.340]  You'll hear a pop.
[20:48.340 --> 20:49.420]  Sounds kind of like a knuckle popping.
[20:49.420 --> 20:50.660]  I pop my knuckle into the microphone.
[20:50.660 --> 20:52.100]  I don't know if it picked up.
[20:52.100 --> 20:53.540]  You'll hear a little pop sound.
[20:53.540 --> 20:55.180]  That is the sound you're looking for.
[20:55.180 --> 20:59.340]  You just want to break the cellulose structure of that plant.
[20:59.340 --> 21:00.700]  So I'll break it once.
[21:00.700 --> 21:04.020]  Then I'll move my left hand from the bottom right up above my right hand and I'll give
[21:04.020 --> 21:05.020]  it another break.
[21:05.020 --> 21:07.060]  Then I'll move up and give it another break.
[21:07.060 --> 21:11.220]  I work my way up the main stem all the way until it gets real thin and I feel like I
[21:11.220 --> 21:14.380]  could cause problems by snapping it up there.
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.800]  Once I've done the main stalk, I go back down to the bottom of the plant and I find the
[21:17.800 --> 21:20.980]  lowest branch and I work that branch all the way up.
[21:20.980 --> 21:24.020]  Then I work every single branch on every single plant.
[21:24.020 --> 21:26.220]  This takes hours in a commercial environment.
[21:26.220 --> 21:30.420]  Your hands will be sore, but the plants will thank you for it in the future.
[21:30.420 --> 21:31.820]  Right now they look like they got twisted.
[21:31.820 --> 21:35.440]  They got a little bit beat up, but in a few days, all of those twists will create what
[21:35.440 --> 21:36.580]  looks like a knuckle.
[21:36.580 --> 21:38.620]  It will make the plant more robust.
[21:38.620 --> 21:39.700]  It will make it stronger.
[21:39.700 --> 21:41.220]  It will give it more strength.
[21:41.220 --> 21:45.220]  I feel like those thicker stalks can move more nutrients, which makes a more productive
[21:45.220 --> 21:46.220]  plant.
[21:46.220 --> 21:47.980]  I feel like a bigger stalk can hold up a bigger bud.
[21:47.980 --> 21:52.060]  So we are working those plants to be more robust by cracking them.
[21:52.060 --> 21:54.300]  They heal themselves and they become stronger.
[21:54.300 --> 21:56.580]  So I like to do popping and twisting at this time.
[21:56.580 --> 22:01.220]  I also like to do a nice defoliation on day one of flower.
[22:01.220 --> 22:02.700]  Take out all that excess leaf.
[22:02.700 --> 22:03.900]  We don't need it.
[22:03.900 --> 22:06.980]  While I'm there, I like to clean up the bottoms quite a bit.
[22:06.980 --> 22:09.140]  Take off some of the crappy bottom branches.
[22:09.140 --> 22:11.020]  Take off some of those sucker branches.
[22:11.020 --> 22:12.460]  Take off all the bottom leaves.
[22:12.460 --> 22:15.740]  We don't need a lot of that crap on the bottom of our plants.
[22:15.740 --> 22:19.460]  Some people like to wait a little bit later, closer to week two, to do the bottoming and
[22:19.460 --> 22:20.460]  the lollipopping.
[22:20.460 --> 22:21.660]  I like to do it early.
[22:21.660 --> 22:24.060]  In a commercial environment, things will get ahead of you.
[22:24.060 --> 22:28.580]  So if you don't start it right away, it gets really easy to fall behind very quickly.
[22:28.580 --> 22:31.340]  And in a commercial environment, that only compounds.
[22:31.340 --> 22:34.140]  So on day one, I move the plants into the flower room.
[22:34.140 --> 22:35.360]  I set up the trellis.
[22:35.360 --> 22:38.500]  I give the plants a nice pop and twist and work them into the trellis.
[22:38.500 --> 22:39.700]  I'll do some defoliating.
[22:39.700 --> 22:42.260]  I like to do a bunch of bottoming and lollipopping.
[22:42.260 --> 22:47.660]  And then right before we leave for the night, we give the plants a nice pesticide spray.
[22:47.660 --> 22:52.260]  Another important thing to think about at this transitional time is bulbs.
[22:52.260 --> 22:55.420]  What kind of bulbs are you going to use for flowering?
[22:55.420 --> 23:00.340]  I usually recommend a metal halide for vegging and a high pressure sodium for flowering.
[23:00.340 --> 23:05.220]  Vegging technology has advanced so far in recent years that you may be using LEDs.
[23:05.220 --> 23:07.300]  You may be using ceramic metal halides.
[23:07.300 --> 23:12.980]  There are tons of options, but consider changing your spectrum early in the flowering phase.
[23:12.980 --> 23:17.600]  One useful trick I have learned to help reduce the early flower stretch is to leave the metal
[23:17.600 --> 23:21.220]  halide bulbs in for the first two weeks of flowering.
[23:21.220 --> 23:24.980]  A lot of people will swap out the metal halides for the high pressure sodiums on day one of
[23:24.980 --> 23:25.980]  flowering.
[23:25.980 --> 23:30.060]  I have learned that if you leave those halides in there for two weeks, your plants will not
[23:30.060 --> 23:33.160]  stretch as ridiculously when you initiate flower.
[23:33.160 --> 23:34.660]  That is natural for plants to stretch.
[23:34.660 --> 23:36.180]  They just want to take off.
[23:36.180 --> 23:41.000]  But cracking them, popping them, twisting them, and keeping in that metal halide will
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.300]  drastically slow down that stretch.
[23:43.300 --> 23:47.760]  All right, podcast world, I feel like we have a good solid foundation on transitioning our
[23:47.760 --> 23:50.140]  plants from veg to flower.
[23:50.140 --> 23:54.620]  At this point, if you are growing from seeds, you will need to keep a close eye on the plants
[23:54.620 --> 23:56.120]  and look out for males.
[23:56.120 --> 24:00.360]  You will need to look out for hermaphrodites, and you will need to pay attention for mutants.
[24:00.360 --> 24:03.360]  If you've got a plant in there doing some weird shit, you need to decide if you want
[24:03.360 --> 24:05.600]  to keep it or let it finish.
[24:05.600 --> 24:08.640]  Sometimes those mutant plants put off amazing products.
[24:08.640 --> 24:11.960]  They are also a pain in the ass to grow, and they are problematic, so sometimes it's not
[24:11.960 --> 24:12.960]  even worth it.
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.640]  So if you've got a mutant, it is up to you to decide what to do.
[24:16.640 --> 24:19.400]  Another thing we need to stay on top of is scouting for insects.
[24:19.400 --> 24:23.480]  Yes, we did just apply some pesticides, we may have released some predator bugs, but
[24:23.480 --> 24:26.080]  that does not mean that we are bulletproof.
[24:26.080 --> 24:29.440]  Always be scouting for pests every day.
[24:29.440 --> 24:33.000]  As you walk through the grow, just to go from one end to the other, to go get the scissors
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.820]  you forgot down there, or to go find the broom, just glance at the plants as you walk by.
[24:37.820 --> 24:40.560]  That is when I make the most random discoveries.
[24:40.560 --> 24:43.520]  I'm not even looking for something, I was just walking by and I said, what the hell
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.320]  is that out of the corner of my eye?
[24:45.320 --> 24:47.640]  Now I know there's a problem, now we can solve it.
[24:47.640 --> 24:51.380]  Always be paying attention, always be scouting for bugs and problems in the grow.
[24:51.380 --> 24:52.680]  Keep your eyes open.
[24:52.680 --> 24:56.400]  We need to look for hermaphrodites, we need to look for males, we need to look for mutants,
[24:56.400 --> 24:59.280]  and we need to pay close attention for signs of pests.
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.000]  All right, podcast world, I can feel the cold medicine that I took starting to kick in.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.800]  My face is going numb, my nose is starting to run kind of weird.
[25:05.800 --> 25:09.640]  I need to wrap up this podcast before I get too lit to be on a microphone.
