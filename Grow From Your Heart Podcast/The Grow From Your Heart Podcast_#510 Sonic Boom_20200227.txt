[00:41.120 --> 00:44.620]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing. I just took
[00:44.620 --> 00:50.640]  a delicious dab of Bounce Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of headbanger
[00:50.640 --> 00:55.920]  and secret kush mints. On the package, the flavor is described as sour, gas, and pine.
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.880]  I think we've talked about this concentrate on the show before. It is certainly Rostegef
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.600]  approved. This is delicious and it is potent. On the back of the package, it says the product
[01:05.600 --> 01:14.480]  contains 72.16% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. That's just how I like it. Very high
[01:14.480 --> 01:20.120]  THC, very low CBD. That is right up my alley. This stuff tastes delicious. It hits really
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.160]  well. It's nice and smooth. I've got a big four gram jar. I'm popping it open to take
[01:24.160 --> 01:30.120]  another fresh look. The ratio of sauce to diamonds in this container was perfect. I
[01:30.120 --> 01:35.760]  really approve. I am really impressed with the Bounce Full Spectrum Extract from my friends
[01:35.760 --> 01:38.600]  at Green Dot Labs.
[01:38.600 --> 01:42.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a fun episode. In this episode, I am going
[01:42.020 --> 01:46.120]  to do a strain description. We are going to talk about a strain that I bred called Sonic
[01:46.120 --> 01:51.320]  Boom. Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a shout out to a few of our friends
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.520]  from Patreon.
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.960]  Let's start this off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out and
[01:56.960 --> 02:02.160]  a fist bump to my new friend, Can Organic Illinois. Let's give a big Giant Grow From
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.480]  Your Heart podcast high five and a fist bump to my friend Mark M. I always want to send
[02:06.480 --> 02:11.480]  a thank you shout out to Ryan S. Let's pass a big fat dab over to Jose. I want to send
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.980]  a big thank you shout out and a fat bowl over to my buddy Greg. Let's roll up a big fat
[02:15.980 --> 02:19.760]  joint and send that over to our friends at Spruce Hill Farm. How about a big thank you
[02:19.800 --> 02:24.560]  shout out to HD Chop? How about a big high five and maybe a weird hug to my buddy Tobes
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.960]  McLovin? I always need to send a big thank you shout out to Kenneth. And last but certainly
[02:28.960 --> 02:35.200]  not least, let's pack up a big fat bong rip for my buddy Tanner M. Big thanks and big

[02:58.720 --> 03:03.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's jump into the fun part of this podcast. Many of
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.920]  you know that I am a breeder. I am the sole breeder and the sole proprietor for Irie Genetics
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.320]  Premium Seeds. I make regular and feminized seeds. I do not make auto flower seeds. A
[03:14.320 --> 03:18.560]  lot of people ask me about autos. I have nothing against autos. That is just not my
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.680]  thing. That is not what I want to do. I work on feminized and regular seeds. I like really
[03:24.680 --> 03:31.040]  terpy high THC, about 63 to 70 day flowering sativa dominant hybrids is kind of what I
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.080]  like to do. Some of my stuff finishes a little earlier, but everything is really terpy and
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.300]  really potent. That is mainly what I'm going for.
[03:39.300 --> 03:43.360]  So in this episode, we are going to focus on a strain that I bred that I have named
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.960]  Sonic Boom. Let's jump right into it and talk about Sonic Boom. What are the parents of
[03:48.960 --> 03:56.160]  Sonic Boom? Sonic Boom is a cross of Lemon OG Haze from the Ethos Collective crossed
[03:56.160 --> 04:03.120]  to My Arise. Now let's talk briefly about the Lemon OG Haze. Lemon OG Haze comes from
[04:03.120 --> 04:08.960]  Ethos and it is a cross of Super Lemon Haze to Ethos OG. I fell in love with it when I
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.720]  ran a commercial cultivation facility here in Colorado. I loved the way the plant grew.
[04:14.720 --> 04:19.420]  I loved the way the plant smelled. I loved the way the plant smoked and I loved the buzz
[04:19.420 --> 04:25.680]  I got when I smoked the flowers and the concentrates. So I quickly fell in love with the Lemon OG
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.480]  Haze. I took a lot of great photos of the Lemon OG Haze. I actually sent a few of them
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.960]  to Colin from Ethos. And if you look at some of the old packaging for the Lemon OG Haze,
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.640]  that real dark purple bud with the purple leaves on there, that is actually my photo.
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.480]  So I've grown a lot of Lemon OG Haze. I've got a lot of experience with it and it is
[04:46.480 --> 04:53.360]  a wonderful plant. Lemon OG Haze grows very quickly in veg. It also grows very rapidly
[04:53.360 --> 04:58.760]  in flower. In one flower room where I ran the Lemon OG Haze, I would have three of every
[04:58.760 --> 05:02.960]  other plant in a row and I would only have two Lemon OG Haze plants because they would
[05:02.960 --> 05:08.200]  fill up the equal amount of space of three plants. So I was able to fill more space with
[05:08.200 --> 05:13.980]  less plants because it grows so quickly and makes such large plants. It also grows quickly
[05:13.980 --> 05:19.920]  in flower. It also takes very well to stretching and topping and bending it around and manipulating
[05:19.920 --> 05:26.560]  it. And it also put out very reliable harvest numbers in all aspects. By that I mean it
[05:26.560 --> 05:30.200]  put out good weights. That's the first number you think about when it comes to harvest.
[05:30.200 --> 05:33.760]  How much did it weigh? Are we going to be able to pay the bills and keep the grow open?
[05:33.760 --> 05:40.920]  Yes, it did that every time. It also put out amazing numbers on the lab reports. Many consumers
[05:40.920 --> 05:47.000]  base their shopping on the potency test on the jar at the dispensary. That Lemon OG Haze
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.280]  would always give us amazing potency results from the lab. So that always worked well.
[05:52.280 --> 05:57.020]  We had a lot of it and a lot of potency, so it would sell, which keeps us in business.
[05:57.020 --> 06:02.180]  So I quickly fell in love with the Lemon OG Haze. What's going to happen when a breeder
[06:02.180 --> 06:08.180]  falls in love with a female plant? My next step is obviously to introduce it to a male
[06:08.180 --> 06:13.700]  plant. I chose to introduce the Lemon OG Haze to my male, which I call King Solomon, which
[06:13.700 --> 06:19.340]  is a select Arise male. Let's talk briefly about my male because I've gone over this
[06:19.340 --> 06:24.460]  guy in a lot of conversations and a lot of podcast episodes. We'll cover him quickly.
[06:24.900 --> 06:33.220]  Arise is a female golden goat plant pollinated by a Daybreaker male. Daybreaker is Chem D
[06:33.220 --> 06:40.340]  and Joseph OG. So the Chem D and Joseph OG bring sort of a funky, chemically gassy, some
[06:40.340 --> 06:44.700]  people say fresh rubber, some people say burnt rubber. It's definitely got some feet and
[06:44.700 --> 06:49.340]  some funk to it and a little bit of skunky aromas. So it's got that side of the palette
[06:49.460 --> 06:54.580]  from the Daybreaker. That's Chem D and Joseph OG. The other side of the cross is golden
[06:54.580 --> 06:59.900]  goat. So that brings a sweet tropical flavor to it. So I bred this sweet tropical to that
[06:59.900 --> 07:04.740]  earthy, gassy, funky tennis ball thing and it made a wonderful cross, which is known
[07:04.740 --> 07:10.980]  as Arise. I've done a full podcast episode on Arise. You can find that in a quick search.
[07:10.980 --> 07:16.040]  We're going to focus more on the cross that came from that today. But the Arise was the
[07:16.040 --> 07:23.240]  male that I used in this cross. I used that male because he is known to pass on vigor.
[07:23.240 --> 07:29.880]  He creates what I call hypervigor. The progeny that come from King Solomon always grow super
[07:29.880 --> 07:36.600]  quickly in veg and rapidly in flower. So I know he passes on that vigor. I also know
[07:36.600 --> 07:43.560]  that he passes on a lot of potency. Everything I have pollinated with King Solomon has created
[07:43.560 --> 07:48.360]  more potent plants. The progeny has come out more potent than the mother plants that
[07:48.360 --> 07:53.160]  I started with. So that is always a goal, always a good thing when you were breeding.
[07:53.160 --> 07:57.720]  So he's known to increase vigor. He is known to increase potency. Another thing that I
[07:57.720 --> 08:03.360]  know this male is good for is he passes on very resistant plants. The plants that come
[08:03.360 --> 08:09.080]  from this male do not get powdery mildew. They do not get bugs. So King Solomon is a
[08:09.160 --> 08:16.520]  very reliable breeding stud. I have chosen to hit the Lemon OG Haze with my King Solomon pollen.
[08:16.520 --> 08:21.640]  The resulting progeny were called Sonic Boom. Now let's focus more on the actual
[08:21.640 --> 08:28.280]  Sonic Boom strain itself. I mainly made this cross because I loved the flavor and aroma of
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.040]  the Lemon OG Haze. I love the potency, but I knew I could make it more potent. I wanted something in
[08:34.040 --> 08:40.440]  my lineup with that lemon-lime-gatorade sort of a flavor. The Lemon OG Haze just spoke to me every
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.160]  time I walked past the plant in the commercial cultivation. Then once I acquired clones of it,
[08:45.160 --> 08:50.520]  those clones just spoke to me every time I would walk by them. I knew it needed to be pollinated
[08:50.520 --> 08:55.640]  by King Solomon. I just knew that it would make amazing flavors. I knew it would make big,
[08:55.640 --> 09:00.360]  vigorous plants. I knew that those plants would put out great numbers. So I had to make the cross.
[09:00.920 --> 09:07.800]  The cross came out exactly how I hoped and expected it would turn out. Most of the phenotypes
[09:07.800 --> 09:14.200]  are dominated by the Lemon OG Haze flavors and aromas. Most of them are dominated by a
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.880]  lemon-lime-gatorade sort of a flavor with some lemon candies. Sometimes I think it kind of smells
[09:19.880 --> 09:25.480]  like a margarita mix. On the middle of the grow, you may catch some grapefruits. A lot of the
[09:25.480 --> 09:31.000]  phenotypes are going to have hints of fuel. I really believe that the fuel is coming from the
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.160]  OG side of the Lemon OG Haze, also coming from that Chem D and the Joseph OG. But most of the
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.400]  phenotypes have really been dominated by that Lemon OG Haze, lemon-lime-gatorade, some kind of
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.040]  green gatorade or green sports drink kind of a flavor. When it gets real pungent, it kind of
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.000]  turns into a margarita mix, that lime flavor and sort of a little wang comes out of it. I really
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.800]  think it smells great. Then the hints of fuel come in from that Daybreaker. Then when you dry
[09:57.800 --> 10:03.160]  it and cure it and smoke it, a little bit more of that funk comes out. It really maintains that
[10:03.160 --> 10:08.680]  lemon candy, lemon flavor, that margarita mix aroma. But then when you smoke it, you get also,
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.800]  I like to say, a little hint of foot. But that's always coming from the Joseph OG side of things.
[10:13.800 --> 10:20.120]  And it possibly is coming a little bit from the OG Kush thing in the Lemon OG Haze.
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.720]  So I think that covers the flavor. Basically, lemon, lime, gatorade, margarita mix,
[10:25.720 --> 10:30.200]  lemon-lime candies, and then some funkiness in the background of it. When you exhale,
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.600]  that funkiness will kind of linger on your tongue, but the room smells more like lemons.
[10:34.600 --> 10:40.120]  So that's my description of the flavor. The buzz. The buzz is tremendous. I keep talking
[10:40.120 --> 10:47.000]  about high-potency crosses. King Solomon makes everything really potent. I've got on a Risecut
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.320]  that reliably tests in the mid-30s at different labs. My Arise number four female that I have
[10:53.320 --> 10:58.600]  selected, she's labeled number four because she was number four in a batch of seeds that I grew.
[10:58.600 --> 11:02.200]  I grew several batches and that batch, she happened to be number four. Sometimes,
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.640]  one of my favorite keepers was Arise E for a long time. I just used letters that time.
[11:07.640 --> 11:12.360]  This time, it was Arise number four is the one I've been keeping. I play with her. She really
[11:12.360 --> 11:17.720]  hits really high test numbers in many different situations. I've got a lab test right here in
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.880]  front of me. I made sure to pull it up on my phone so I can read it accurately. This says
[11:21.880 --> 11:29.880]  35.84% THCA, and that is coming from my Arise number four female. The male plant that I use
[11:29.880 --> 11:35.960]  in my crosses came from the same batch of seeds as that high-testing Arisecut. It is just a male
[11:35.960 --> 11:40.120]  phenotype. It came from the same batch of seeds, so it has got the same potential.
[11:40.760 --> 11:48.040]  I feel like that potential really came through in this cross. Lemon OG haze produces highly
[11:48.040 --> 11:53.240]  potent flowers. If you flower these long enough and you chop them down at the right time and you
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.960]  dry and cure them, you will have highly potent cannabis. This will be very medicinal product.
[11:59.960 --> 12:05.880]  If you make concentrates out of these plants, you are going to have amazing concentrates.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.680]  Some flowers, some concentrates, I can smoke and smoke and smoke, and I get to this point
[12:10.680 --> 12:14.920]  where I say I'm saturated or I'm maxed out or I've reached the limit. That's just
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.640]  how stoned I'm going to get today. There's no going past that. Once you've been smoking for
[12:19.640 --> 12:23.640]  as long as somebody like myself or a lot of other people, a lot of medical patients,
[12:23.640 --> 12:28.520]  we saturate ourselves on a daily basis. You get to this limit, and that's as high as your mind
[12:28.520 --> 12:32.840]  and your body are going to let you get no matter how much more you smoke. I feel like when I smoke
[12:32.840 --> 12:37.800]  lemon OG haze, I can always top it just a little bit more. There's always that one more, like,
[12:37.800 --> 12:42.840]  oh shit, I can get that high. I call it high school high. Remember in high school when you
[12:42.840 --> 12:47.480]  would smoke and you'd get so high that nobody knew you smoked, but for some reason you thought
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.280]  everybody in a hundred mile radius got a letter in the mail that said, you just smoked a fat joint.
[12:52.280 --> 12:55.720]  They all need to stare at you and laugh at you and make you feel uncomfortable.
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.160]  None of that shit was happening, but in your head, you thought everybody was looking at you.
[12:59.160 --> 13:02.440]  You thought you had crumbs on your shirt. You thought you smelled funny. You thought you heard
[13:02.440 --> 13:06.120]  a dog barking in the background. None of that shit was happening, but your brain was fucking
[13:06.120 --> 13:10.840]  with you. Sonic boom can still get me to that point at this point in the game, and I've been
[13:10.840 --> 13:16.200]  smoking forever. So if there's a night where I'm lit and I've just maxed out, I've had my
[13:16.200 --> 13:22.520]  quota of fat dabs or fat joints or whatever, I can still turn to the sonic boom and take a fat dab
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.960]  or smoke a couple of bowls, and I can still reach that next level. I can still get nicely medicated
[13:27.960 --> 13:31.560]  or good and high or whatever. If there's still another band to watch, or if there's another
[13:31.560 --> 13:35.880]  comedian, or if there's something else that I want to get stoned again for, I can do it again.
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.880]  Because once you've medicated a few times a day and you're trying to get stoned at the end of
[13:39.880 --> 13:43.960]  the night, sometimes it just doesn't work. But once you're at that point, I feel like the sonic
[13:43.960 --> 13:49.160]  boom will be the strain that will help you get another buzz going on. So that is the start. It
[13:49.160 --> 13:55.400]  is limitless, I feel like. When you start smoking sonic boom, you can keep going and it is limitless.
[13:55.400 --> 14:00.680]  It will give you giggles. You will get an intense head high. You get that paranoid
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.240]  tunnel vision thing to where you're looking for your sunglasses, but they are on your head.
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.960]  You're trying to turn down the music so that you can see the traffic better. It's one of those
[14:09.960 --> 14:14.120]  kinds of herbs that make the music too loud, but it's not really that loud. It was actually the
[14:14.120 --> 14:19.000]  air conditioner that was too loud. It's that kind of herb that makes you disoriented and confused.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.240]  And honestly, that's what I love. So it can give some folks a little bit of discomfort,
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.920]  kind of panicky, but I really love the intense, intense head high that comes from sonic boom.
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.640]  So that's the buzz. That's the flavor. That's the aroma. We have covered the consumption part.
[14:33.640 --> 14:41.640]  Let's focus more on the cultivation aspects of sonic boom. Sonic boom is a very fast vegging
[14:41.640 --> 14:48.520]  plant. It is also very vigorous in flower. It will get fairly tall on you, but not extremely tall. A
[14:48.520 --> 14:53.480]  lot of my stuff will get what I call extremely tall. It will double or triple in height by the
[14:53.480 --> 14:59.560]  time it is done flowering. Sonic boom does have the potential to double in height throughout the
[14:59.560 --> 15:06.280]  flowering phase. Sonic boom likes to make tall branchy plants, but it makes a lot of branches
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.320]  with a lot of bud sites. That's one of the things I love about it. If you clean up the bottoms of
[15:11.320 --> 15:16.840]  those branches and just leave the few six or eight inches on the tip with foliage and with bud sites
[15:16.840 --> 15:22.120]  on there, you will get long, ridiculous colas. Clean up the bottom stuff, send that energy up
[15:22.120 --> 15:29.000]  to the top and you get amazing, amazing colas from the sonic boom. They are tall, branchy,
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.520]  fast growing plants. They have medium stretch. Like I said before, it has the potential to double
[15:34.520 --> 15:42.520]  its height in the flowering phase. Most phenotypes you will find finish within 63 to 72 days. Of
[15:42.520 --> 15:48.440]  course, there will be outliers on both directions. They are rarely earlier finishers. You are more
[15:48.440 --> 15:54.600]  common to find a little bit longer finisher. Sometimes the 75 day mark is okay. I really like
[15:54.600 --> 16:00.920]  a 65 day finisher on the sonic boom. It's got nice tight buds. It's got that aroma and it's
[16:00.920 --> 16:05.160]  just as potent as you need it around 65 days if you've got that phenotype.
[16:05.720 --> 16:12.840]  Sonic boom makes lots of bright green, colorful buds, bright greens, bright orange pistils,
[16:12.840 --> 16:18.120]  really beautiful buds. It is very photogenic. If you're into taking pictures of flowers and
[16:18.120 --> 16:23.880]  you like those bright green buds with really bright green leaves, lime green leaves, and then
[16:23.880 --> 16:30.120]  accented by bright orange pistils, you will love the photos that come from your sonic boom plants.
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.320]  You'll also love the giant buds. Those will look really good in photos, but they are going to need
[16:35.320 --> 16:40.680]  some sort of supports. I keep saying how quickly and vigorously this plant grows. It will make
[16:40.680 --> 16:47.400]  giant colas. You are going to need some sort of supports. These plants like being trellised and
[16:47.400 --> 16:53.400]  netted and put in tomato cages and manipulated and topped and twisted and bent around. They will
[16:53.400 --> 16:59.160]  take all of the abuse you can give them and they will spring back and laugh at you like nothing
[16:59.160 --> 17:06.440]  even happened. I really like using a net to spread out a sonic boom plant, spread it out really far,
[17:06.440 --> 17:10.440]  then let it veg up through the net just a little bit, put a net up above that one,
[17:10.440 --> 17:15.240]  let it stretch into that net and then flower it and then put up another net and possibly another
[17:15.240 --> 17:21.080]  net for those giant buds to grow into. If you're not using trellising, you will need some sort of
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.200]  sticks. Buy the tall sticks because these plants are going to get tall. If you don't like having
[17:26.200 --> 17:30.600]  a bunch of sticks in the room because it does become an eye hazard, a lot of people have poked
[17:30.600 --> 17:36.120]  their eyes on those bamboo sticks in the grow room, if you don't want to use those, maybe you can use
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.160]  a tomato cage, but I do recommend some sort of support system for these plants because they are
[17:41.160 --> 17:47.080]  going to get big buds that will be very top heavy and they will fall over and break your branches.
[17:47.960 --> 17:55.320]  Most phenotypes of sonic boom will react very well to being topped. In most cases, when you top it,
[17:55.320 --> 18:01.960]  it is going to take off and grow rapidly. If you want to run a quick crop that will be potent,
[18:01.960 --> 18:08.760]  vigorous and have a very nice harvest weight, I recommend a few sonic boom plants in three
[18:08.760 --> 18:15.080]  gallon pots. Don't top them, veg them. Once they're about knee high, flower them out. If you put about
[18:15.080 --> 18:20.840]  nine of those under a thousand watt light and a five by five tent, you will have a beautiful harvest.
[18:20.840 --> 18:26.440]  If you have got more space, I absolutely recommend going with larger pots and topping the plants.
[18:26.440 --> 18:32.760]  You can get very branchy, very bushy plants from the sonic boom. It loves to grow. When you top it,
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.960]  it just shows off. It's like, oh yeah, you think so? And it just makes more branching and goes crazy.
[18:37.960 --> 18:44.280]  She likes to make really long branches with minimal space between bud sites. I have learned
[18:44.280 --> 18:48.920]  that if I clean up the bottoms of those branches, but don't take off the branches and still leave
[18:48.920 --> 18:54.440]  the ends to where they can develop buds, all of those branches develop giant bud sites if they
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.880]  are allowed to get enough light. So trellis it out, clean up the bottom of it, get all of those
[18:59.880 --> 19:05.000]  long branches to reach the screen. And when every branch has reached the screen, when you flower it
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.920]  out, all of those little branches will create nice, decent sized colas. All of the big tops will
[19:10.920 --> 19:17.960]  create amazing, impressive colas. Something about sonic boom just makes these plants want to grow.
[19:17.960 --> 19:22.520]  And when you manipulate them, when you bully them, when you try to slow them down, they just go,
[19:22.520 --> 19:27.720]  yeah, right. Watch what I can do. Another thing that these plants respond very well to
[19:27.720 --> 19:32.120]  is popping and twisting. I talk a lot about popping and twisting my branches.
[19:32.120 --> 19:36.920]  It's called super cropping. It's known as a lot of different things. I do it for several reasons.
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.960]  First, it slows down my stretch in flower. If your plants are being popped and twisted and
[19:41.960 --> 19:46.120]  cracked during the flowering phase, they're going to spend energy repairing that cracking
[19:46.120 --> 19:51.000]  and twisting and that broken cellulose fiber, and they won't be able to stretch. So the first three
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.440]  weeks of flower, I do a lot of popping and twisting and manipulating of the branches just to slow down
[19:56.440 --> 20:03.240]  that 21-day stretch. I also think popping and twisting makes bigger, more robust stocks. You'll
[20:03.240 --> 20:07.880]  notice that everywhere you pop it, you've created a little knuckle, and those knuckles are sturdier
[20:07.880 --> 20:13.080]  than the sections without knuckles. So I really knurl up my plants quite a bit. I pop as much as
[20:13.080 --> 20:19.080]  I can, create as many knuckles as I can on every plant. Then clean up that lower part, clean up the
[20:19.080 --> 20:22.920]  bottoms of the branches, take off all the little sucker branches, take off all the little shitty
[20:22.920 --> 20:29.560]  shoots, just leave the big tops, trellis it out real far. You will have amazing, impressive harvests
[20:29.560 --> 20:36.120]  and results with the Sonic Boom. Now let's focus more on some phenotypes. I've got a note that says
[20:36.120 --> 20:42.520]  the skinny leaves are the lemon-lime turps. That is very accurate in my mind. The skinnier the
[20:42.520 --> 20:47.400]  leaves, the more lemon-lime flavor you are going to get. Those bigger leaves, you start getting
[20:47.400 --> 20:53.160]  these OG Kush, gassier, funkier flavors. That is obvious that when we go to the skinnier leaves,
[20:53.160 --> 20:57.960]  we're leaning more toward the lemon haze and the golden goat in the cross. When we get the bigger
[20:57.960 --> 21:03.880]  leaves, obviously we're bringing out the OG Kush, the Chem D, and the Joseph OG. So if you were
[21:03.880 --> 21:10.360]  looking for that lemon-lime, maybe that margarita mix flavor, look more toward the skinnier-leaved
[21:10.360 --> 21:16.200]  phenotypes. Now keep in mind that it kind of makes sense that those skinnier-leaved phenotypes are
[21:16.200 --> 21:22.360]  also possibly going to take a little bit longer to finish than the broader-leaved phenotypes.
[21:22.360 --> 21:27.480]  They're going to be more sativa dominant, so they will take a little bit longer. Maybe give those
[21:27.480 --> 21:34.280]  closer to 10 weeks, maybe give them that 70, 72, possibly 75 days to flower. It will be worth it.
[21:34.280 --> 21:41.000]  Most of the phenotypes that you find will produce very dense buds. Most of the phenotypes will be
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.920]  very frosty, and most of them will have that margarita mix, lemon-lime, Gatorade sort of a
[21:46.920 --> 21:51.960]  flavor. The main differences you will see in phenotypes are obviously the skinnier leaves
[21:51.960 --> 21:56.440]  and the larger leaves. And of course, the skinnier ones, like I've said, make that lime flavor. The
[21:56.440 --> 22:01.960]  bigger leaves make that sort of a funky, fresh rubber or burnt rubber or a tennis ball and a
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.960]  gassy, fuely sort of a flavor. And obviously the wider-leaved phenotype will finish earlier.
[22:07.960 --> 22:14.120]  But you'll also notice a phenotype that has big leaves that stay droopy. That is not a problem
[22:14.120 --> 22:19.560]  with the plant. That is a trait that comes from Daybreaker. That is a very fun plant to grow.
[22:19.560 --> 22:25.560]  You're going to get gassy, cushy tennis balls with margarita mix on top of that. That is kind
[22:25.560 --> 22:30.840]  of a rare and unique phenotype, but that one does pop up. There's also one that I believe
[22:30.840 --> 22:35.640]  has a lot of island sweet skunk in it that takes a long time. That thing is super potent,
[22:35.640 --> 22:40.280]  but it will take a while to finish and it will have this lemon grapefruit sort of a flavor to it.
[22:40.280 --> 22:45.720]  And it may have pink pistils. If you see pink pistils, you have got the island sweet skunk
[22:45.720 --> 22:51.880]  grapefruit phenotype. Now, in my experience, all of these phenotypes are desirable because I love
[22:51.880 --> 22:58.920]  the buzz that comes from all of these. All of these plants also are going to demand high nitrogen.
[22:58.920 --> 23:05.320]  These plants like a lot of nutrients. I recommend feeding the shit out of these plants. I always
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.040]  recommend pushing your plants a little bit. Feed them what you're used to feeding them and pay
[23:10.040 --> 23:13.960]  attention to the tips of the leaves. I call it getting their nails done. If it looks like the
[23:13.960 --> 23:18.440]  tips of the leaves are just starting to get burnt or just starting to curl a little bit, that is
[23:18.440 --> 23:22.600]  right where you want to be. You can pull back a little bit if you want or just keep feeding
[23:22.600 --> 23:28.520]  just like that and your plants will give you their optimal performance. But I really feel like Sonic
[23:28.760 --> 23:35.560]  Boom really performs well when you feed her a lot of nutrients. She is really hungry. The lemon OG
[23:35.560 --> 23:40.440]  is a really vigorous, fast-growing plant that eats a lot of nitrogen. And of course, it's got
[23:40.440 --> 23:45.880]  golden goat on the other side of the cross, which is almost always macronutrient deficient. So be in
[23:45.880 --> 23:50.920]  there with your macronutrients and be prepared to give those plants a boost when they need it.
[23:50.920 --> 23:57.640]  So I think that is my strain review of Sonic Boom. It is a very vigorous, very fast-growing,
[23:57.640 --> 24:04.280]  very large plant. It makes very Gatorade type, lemon-lime sports drink, maybe a margarita mix
[24:04.280 --> 24:09.880]  flavored kind of a bud. I think it makes amazing concentrates. Be prepared for big plants. I know
[24:09.880 --> 24:15.560]  I keep saying that. This plant will do wonderfully indoors if you give it the space. It will do
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.120]  beautifully in a greenhouse environment. And if you've got a nice condition outdoors where
[24:20.120 --> 24:26.760]  these plants will finish on time, I would allow them 65 days outside and you will have giant,
[24:26.760 --> 24:32.440]  frosty, delicious, beautiful plants. One more thing I should mention, one note that I overlooked
[24:32.440 --> 24:38.920]  because I got way ahead of myself is Sonic Boom is very tolerant of high humidity conditions.
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.680]  So if you're struggling with your VPD, Sonic Boom may work in your environment. She's got those
[24:44.680 --> 24:50.120]  skinny leaves. She doesn't get powdery mildew. She doesn't get pests. She is great for high
[24:50.120 --> 24:54.760]  humidity environments. All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.640]  friends and foes, smokers and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers, I think the next
[24:59.640 --> 25:06.200]  step is to let you know where to pick up a pack of Sonic Boom seeds. Of course, I would recommend
