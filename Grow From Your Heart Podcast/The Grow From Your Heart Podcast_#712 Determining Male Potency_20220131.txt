[00:16.890 --> 00:17.730]  Is that working?
[00:17.730 --> 00:18.610]  This is working.
[00:18.610 --> 00:20.210]  That's working.
[00:20.210 --> 00:21.610]  I think it's time for a podcast.
[00:21.610 --> 00:22.430]  Here we go.
[00:22.430 --> 00:23.730]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.

[00:26.050 --> 00:30.970]  This is episode 712 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:30.970 --> 00:32.610]  In this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit
[00:32.610 --> 00:35.650]  about male plants before I get to that part of the show.
[00:35.650 --> 00:38.290]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks

[01:15.830 --> 01:17.770]  to Rasta Green Thumb.

[01:20.030 --> 01:22.550]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:22.550 --> 01:24.430]  If you are not already supporting the show
[01:24.430 --> 01:26.150]  and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:26.150 --> 01:30.830]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[01:30.830 --> 01:32.630]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:32.630 --> 01:33.910]  All of the information you need
[01:33.910 --> 01:35.430]  will be right there on the screen.
[01:35.430 --> 01:37.870]  And you know I do include that link in the show notes
[01:37.870 --> 01:40.670]  and in the video description to make it nice
[01:40.670 --> 01:43.670]  and easy for all of my friends.
[01:43.670 --> 01:45.190]  All right, I feel like I got all the business
[01:45.190 --> 01:46.170]  out of the way.
[01:46.170 --> 01:48.030]  Where do we go from there?
[01:48.030 --> 01:49.930]  Let's jump right here into this part.
[01:49.930 --> 01:51.510]  Recently on social media,
[01:51.510 --> 01:53.310]  I saw something that kind of bothered me.
[01:53.310 --> 01:54.750]  A member of the IRI Army,
[01:54.750 --> 01:56.770]  a friend made a mistake in the grow room.
[01:56.770 --> 01:58.630]  They actually had an equipment failure
[01:58.630 --> 02:01.150]  and a lot of people, they jumped on that person
[02:01.150 --> 02:03.550]  and they gave them a bunch of negative feedback,
[02:03.550 --> 02:05.110]  a bunch of negative criticism.
[02:05.110 --> 02:06.610]  The feedback was kind of 50-50.
[02:06.610 --> 02:08.510]  Some people said you can do it.
[02:08.510 --> 02:09.790]  Just try again, grow harder.
[02:09.790 --> 02:13.390]  But a lot of people were very not super kind about that.
[02:13.390 --> 02:15.550]  You guys, people are going to make mistakes.
[02:15.550 --> 02:16.630]  This person took it to heart
[02:16.630 --> 02:18.110]  when you guys talk trash to them,
[02:18.110 --> 02:19.550]  kind of messed up their day.
[02:19.550 --> 02:21.330]  People are going to make mistakes.
[02:21.330 --> 02:23.150]  You're going to make mistakes in your grow.
[02:23.150 --> 02:25.530]  Don't be afraid to make some mistakes.
[02:25.530 --> 02:26.430]  Things are gonna happen.
[02:26.430 --> 02:28.030]  Equipment is going to fail.
[02:28.030 --> 02:29.270]  You're gonna mess up schedules.
[02:29.270 --> 02:30.990]  You're gonna mismeasure some stuff.
[02:30.990 --> 02:31.990]  Plants are gonna die.
[02:31.990 --> 02:32.810]  But guess what?
[02:32.810 --> 02:34.090]  Life goes on.
[02:34.090 --> 02:35.870]  The key is to grow again
[02:35.870 --> 02:38.270]  so that you've got some good weed to smoke next time
[02:38.270 --> 02:39.870]  when shit goes wrong.
[02:39.870 --> 02:41.110]  So don't be discouraged.
[02:41.110 --> 02:42.590]  Don't give up if you make mistakes.
[02:42.590 --> 02:44.150]  I've done a full episode
[02:44.150 --> 02:46.350]  about making major mistakes in grows.
[02:46.350 --> 02:47.830]  I've destroyed entire crops.
[02:47.830 --> 02:50.230]  I was halfway through a flowering crop one year,
[02:51.350 --> 02:53.310]  maybe last year, maybe the year before.
[02:53.310 --> 02:54.350]  I was trying new lights.
[02:54.350 --> 02:55.930]  I was halfway through a flowering crop.
[02:55.930 --> 02:57.230]  It was fully seeded.
[02:57.230 --> 02:58.530]  It would have been a great market run.
[02:58.530 --> 03:00.470]  You guys would have really enjoyed those seeds.
[03:00.470 --> 03:02.910]  I was not satisfied with the quality of those plants.
[03:02.910 --> 03:04.150]  I cut them down.
[03:04.150 --> 03:04.990]  I made mistakes.
[03:04.990 --> 03:08.230]  I cut my losses, cleaned up, regrouped, started over.
[03:09.070 --> 03:10.710]  It hurt my little ego.
[03:10.710 --> 03:11.550]  It hurt my feelings.
[03:11.550 --> 03:13.590]  It hurt my budget, definitely.
[03:13.590 --> 03:14.750]  But I learned a lot from it.
[03:14.750 --> 03:17.350]  I learned not to use that lighting in the winter.
[03:17.350 --> 03:20.110]  I learned not to switch lighting in the middle of a grow.
[03:20.110 --> 03:22.250]  I learned how to use those lights eventually.
[03:22.250 --> 03:23.630]  It was a great learning experience.
[03:23.630 --> 03:25.470]  So you guys, when you do make mistakes,
[03:25.470 --> 03:26.390]  I'm not gonna say if,
[03:26.390 --> 03:28.390]  I'm going to say when you do make a mistake
[03:28.390 --> 03:29.590]  because it's gonna happen.
[03:29.590 --> 03:31.150]  If you're not a robot, if you're not a machine,
[03:31.150 --> 03:33.450]  and still then, those things make fucking mistakes.
[03:33.450 --> 03:35.250]  If you make mistakes, if you make errors,
[03:35.250 --> 03:37.630]  if your plants die, it's not the end of the world.
[03:38.070 --> 03:39.110]  It is just the end of those plants.
[03:39.110 --> 03:41.110]  Life goes on, shit happens.
[03:41.110 --> 03:42.350]  Grow more weed.
[03:42.350 --> 03:43.230]  Let's do it again.
[03:43.230 --> 03:44.610]  All right, big shout out to my friend
[03:44.610 --> 03:46.390]  that made some mistakes.
[03:46.390 --> 03:47.790]  They actually ended up with some fresh seeds.
[03:47.790 --> 03:48.790]  They were well taken care of.
[03:48.790 --> 03:50.110]  They're gonna give it another run.
[03:50.110 --> 03:52.330]  They have been re-encouraged and revitalized.
[03:52.330 --> 03:54.610]  You guys, don't let mistakes scare you away.
[03:54.610 --> 03:56.910]  There's a full episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[03:56.910 --> 03:58.070]  about mistakes.
[03:58.070 --> 04:01.350]  I talk about the things that I have done to destroy plants,
[04:01.350 --> 04:02.510]  ruin full grows.
[04:02.510 --> 04:03.950]  I encourage you to check that out.
[04:03.950 --> 04:04.790]  I'm not perfect.
[04:04.790 --> 04:06.030]  Nobody's perfect.
[04:06.030 --> 04:07.270]  Killing plants and ruining shit
[04:07.270 --> 04:09.150]  is how I got good at growing.
[04:09.150 --> 04:10.310]  You don't get better at anything
[04:10.310 --> 04:11.930]  by getting it right the first time.
[04:11.930 --> 04:13.070]  You have to make a mistake.
[04:13.070 --> 04:14.710]  Then, take notes of your mistakes,
[04:14.710 --> 04:17.270]  and now you know exactly what not to do.
[04:17.270 --> 04:20.570]  And of course, sometimes equipment is just going to fail.
[04:20.570 --> 04:21.790]  You can't help that.
[04:21.790 --> 04:22.830]  All right, where do we go from there?
[04:22.830 --> 04:24.310]  I do have more notes.
[04:25.710 --> 04:28.150]  Also, yes, thank you for the great feedback, you guys.
[04:28.150 --> 04:30.370]  I got some amazing, awesome feedback
[04:30.370 --> 04:32.890]  from the past two or three episodes.
[04:32.890 --> 04:35.470]  From episode 709, when I talked about
[04:35.910 --> 04:37.150]  the evolution of dabbing,
[04:37.150 --> 04:39.350]  I got quite a few comments, responses,
[04:39.350 --> 04:41.130]  emails, and feedback from that.
[04:41.130 --> 04:44.550]  Then, of course, episode 710, oh my goodness.
[04:44.550 --> 04:46.070]  Big shout out to Pedro once again.
[04:46.070 --> 04:47.990]  Big shout out to Roz and Ryan.
[04:47.990 --> 04:49.850]  And big thanks to the audience out there.
[04:49.850 --> 04:52.750]  Everybody for watching, the feedback,
[04:52.750 --> 04:54.350]  the corrections, the comments, the concerns,
[04:54.350 --> 04:55.710]  all of that stuff.
[04:55.710 --> 04:57.750]  The comments are what I was going to say.
[04:57.750 --> 04:58.750]  Big thanks for all that.
[04:58.750 --> 05:01.510]  That episode got a lot of responses.
[05:01.510 --> 05:03.710]  The YouTube comments are, they're flooded.
[05:03.710 --> 05:04.730]  There's a bunch of comments there.
[05:04.770 --> 05:05.930]  The emails are coming in.
[05:05.930 --> 05:07.370]  The questions are being asked.
[05:07.370 --> 05:08.650]  You guys are watching the show.
[05:08.650 --> 05:10.490]  Thank you, I do appreciate that.
[05:10.490 --> 05:12.850]  Then, episode 711, I had a lot of fun
[05:12.850 --> 05:14.570]  doing the munchies episode.
[05:14.570 --> 05:16.690]  I talked for like 40 minutes about munchies.
[05:16.690 --> 05:18.410]  I did not mean to go on that long.
[05:18.410 --> 05:19.610]  It was a super easy show.
[05:19.610 --> 05:20.450]  I got rambly.
[05:20.450 --> 05:21.910]  You guys seemed to enjoy it.
[05:21.910 --> 05:23.790]  Thank you for the, first of all,
[05:23.790 --> 05:25.890]  for the feedback to make that episode.
[05:25.890 --> 05:28.330]  That was a very audience-generated episode.
[05:28.330 --> 05:31.170]  So thank you for giving me the info to make that show.
[05:31.170 --> 05:33.090]  And then thank you once again for the feedback
[05:33.090 --> 05:35.090]  coming from that episode.
[05:35.090 --> 05:37.530]  Also, I'm still getting feedback from that.
[05:37.530 --> 05:39.050]  People are listening to it,
[05:39.050 --> 05:40.370]  and now they're messaging me saying,
[05:40.370 --> 05:42.110]  this is what I like to eat.
[05:42.110 --> 05:44.530]  Mangoes have been real popular, lots of fruit,
[05:44.530 --> 05:47.810]  and still that box has been popular.
[05:47.810 --> 05:49.270]  So you guys keep doing it.
[05:49.270 --> 05:50.850]  Keep smoking, keep eating.
[05:50.850 --> 05:52.090]  Keep sending me great feedback.
[05:52.090 --> 05:53.290]  I do appreciate it.
[05:53.290 --> 05:54.130]  It has been great.
[05:54.130 --> 05:56.850]  All those comments, all the feedback,
[05:56.850 --> 05:59.250]  even the concerns, the constructive criticism,
[05:59.250 --> 06:01.330]  all that stuff, it does kind of recharge me.
[06:01.330 --> 06:02.150]  It refuels me.
[06:02.190 --> 06:03.830]  It gives me a little bit of energy.
[06:03.830 --> 06:04.670]  It keeps me going.
[06:04.670 --> 06:06.230]  It refreshes me.
[06:06.230 --> 06:07.750]  It's just like a good job.
[06:07.750 --> 06:09.550]  Anytime you tell somebody they did a good job,
[06:09.550 --> 06:10.690]  it encourages them.
[06:10.690 --> 06:12.590]  That means a lot coming from you guys.
[06:12.590 --> 06:13.710]  I know that I'm helping somebody,
[06:13.710 --> 06:15.850]  and it makes me feel like I'm not just talking to myself
[06:15.850 --> 06:17.910]  into this camera with this expensive mic,
[06:17.910 --> 06:19.350]  because that would be a sign of mental illness
[06:19.350 --> 06:20.550]  if I was just doing this for me.
[06:20.550 --> 06:22.230]  Anyway, I'm getting rambly.
[06:22.230 --> 06:23.070]  I'm kind of baked today.
[06:23.070 --> 06:24.270]  It's been a great day.
[06:24.270 --> 06:26.110]  Let's focus a little more.
[06:26.110 --> 06:28.270]  You guys, I went to the dispensary today.
[06:28.270 --> 06:32.270]  Big shout out to my friends at Doctors' Orders STEM Beach
[06:32.270 --> 06:34.310]  at the south end of Pueblo, Colorado.
[06:34.310 --> 06:35.430]  If you're down there, check them out.
[06:35.430 --> 06:37.910]  Let them know that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[06:37.910 --> 06:39.350]  They will take extra good care of you.
[06:39.350 --> 06:40.350]  They'll take good care of you
[06:40.350 --> 06:41.910]  no matter what at that dispensary.
[06:41.910 --> 06:43.630]  It's a small little spot.
[06:43.630 --> 06:46.270]  There's hardly ever a line, hardly ever a wait.
[06:46.270 --> 06:48.670]  You can usually walk in, get the products you need,
[06:48.670 --> 06:51.190]  and be on your way in just a few minutes.
[06:51.190 --> 06:53.430]  They have got marvelous flowers,
[06:53.430 --> 06:54.710]  and they have got my favorite.
[06:54.710 --> 06:56.710]  They've got the Green Dot batters
[06:56.750 --> 07:00.230]  and Green Dot rosins and Green Dot HCFSE,
[07:00.230 --> 07:02.430]  the high, what is that, the high cannabinoids?
[07:02.430 --> 07:04.390]  The FSE, the full spectrum extracts
[07:04.390 --> 07:05.550]  is what they've got there.
[07:05.550 --> 07:06.750]  So many letters and so many things.
[07:06.750 --> 07:09.030]  What I normally buy is the batter, to be honest with you.
[07:09.030 --> 07:09.990]  I get the batter.
[07:09.990 --> 07:11.910]  Occasionally, I get the pens.
[07:11.910 --> 07:14.870]  Right now, they've also got a bunch of Incredibles edibles.
[07:14.870 --> 07:16.190]  They did not pay for this ad.
[07:16.190 --> 07:17.030]  They're just good to me.
[07:17.030 --> 07:18.310]  Shout out to my buddy Ricky over there,
[07:18.310 --> 07:20.750]  always taking good care of me, Bud Tinder of the year.
[07:20.750 --> 07:24.710]  I was there today stocking up on my Green Dot concentrates.
[07:24.710 --> 07:28.110]  The one that I bought, it is named after an artist.
[07:28.110 --> 07:29.550]  It is called Dali.
[07:29.550 --> 07:31.350]  That Dali, bro, get you a gram of that.
[07:31.350 --> 07:33.550]  That will kick your dick in the dirt.
[07:33.550 --> 07:35.870]  It'll get you rambling on a podcast.
[07:35.870 --> 07:39.190]  Anyhow, while I was there, my good friend Ricky,
[07:39.190 --> 07:40.690]  shout out to Ricky, growing that orange gas.
[07:40.690 --> 07:41.830]  I'm like a champ,
[07:41.830 --> 07:46.270]  gave me this propaganda paper from the dispensary.
[07:46.270 --> 07:47.730]  The Marijuana Enforcement Division
[07:47.730 --> 07:51.110]  is now passing out this paperwork when you buy concentrates.
[07:51.110 --> 07:52.710]  You're supposed to pass this to a customer
[07:52.710 --> 07:54.910]  that buys concentrates in the dispensary.
[07:54.910 --> 07:57.950]  The top of it says, Colorado Department of Revenue,
[07:57.950 --> 08:00.030]  Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[08:00.030 --> 08:02.630]  use of regulated marijuana concentrate.
[08:02.630 --> 08:03.710]  I just thought this was interesting,
[08:03.710 --> 08:04.950]  so I'm gonna share this with you.
[08:04.950 --> 08:06.430]  We're gonna kind of mock this a little bit
[08:06.430 --> 08:08.190]  is what's really gonna happen here.
[08:08.190 --> 08:10.230]  They gave this to me, which I thought was funny.
[08:10.230 --> 08:11.390]  He laughed when he gave it to me.
[08:11.390 --> 08:12.750]  He said, I have to give this to every customer
[08:12.750 --> 08:13.590]  who buys a concentrate.
[08:13.590 --> 08:15.490]  And I was like, oh good, because I'm new.
[08:16.470 --> 08:18.430]  Of all people that needed some dabbing advice,
[08:18.430 --> 08:19.830]  it is definitely me.
[08:19.830 --> 08:22.830]  This is the medical and retail marijuana stores
[08:22.830 --> 08:24.370]  are required, this says,
[08:24.370 --> 08:26.270]  the medical and retail marijuana stores
[08:26.270 --> 08:28.050]  are required to provide this resource
[08:28.050 --> 08:32.430]  to individuals purchasing regulated marijuana concentrate.
[08:32.430 --> 08:36.130]  I feel like Nancy Grace when I say marijuana concentrate.
[08:36.130 --> 08:38.110]  You guys excuse the raspy voice also.
[08:38.110 --> 08:40.350]  That's from way too many dabs.
[08:40.350 --> 08:43.190]  But life goes on, we must do a podcast.
[08:43.190 --> 08:46.110]  This does say, examples of a serving size
[08:46.110 --> 08:47.390]  for each type of concentrate.
[08:47.790 --> 08:51.830]  It describes the expected serving sizes for a concentrate.
[08:51.830 --> 08:54.230]  It goes on, it says, regulated marijuana stores
[08:54.230 --> 08:56.670]  offer various categories of marijuana concentrates.
[08:56.670 --> 08:58.550]  Stores may refer to marijuana concentrates
[08:58.550 --> 08:59.910]  using different names, including,
[08:59.910 --> 09:03.430]  but not limited to terms like shatter, wax, butter,
[09:03.430 --> 09:06.110]  sugar, hash, resin, and rosin.
[09:06.110 --> 09:07.950]  So they talk about all the different names.
[09:07.950 --> 09:09.590]  Then here's where they get serious.
[09:09.590 --> 09:12.990]  Start low and go slow.
[09:12.990 --> 09:13.930]  That's real advice.
[09:13.930 --> 09:15.150]  I once heard a guy say,
[09:15.150 --> 09:17.310]  you can't unsmoke that joint, can you?
[09:18.130 --> 09:18.970]  And he was fucking right.
[09:18.970 --> 09:20.510]  But it says, start low and go slow.
[09:20.510 --> 09:21.830]  Then it says, vaping.
[09:21.830 --> 09:23.830]  Vaporizers heat marijuana concentrate
[09:23.830 --> 09:26.110]  to release THC for inhalation.
[09:26.110 --> 09:28.270]  The serving size should not exceed
[09:28.270 --> 09:32.150]  one inhalation lasting two seconds per serving.
[09:32.150 --> 09:34.670]  So they want you to, vapors that heat concentrate,
[09:34.670 --> 09:36.630]  the serving size should not exceed
[09:36.630 --> 09:39.550]  one inhalation lasting two seconds.
[09:39.550 --> 09:43.230]  That's one 1,000, two 1,000.
[09:43.230 --> 09:44.190]  That's what they want you to do.
[09:44.190 --> 09:45.310]  That makes sense, bro.
[09:45.310 --> 09:46.630]  If you're new, that'll work for you.
[09:46.630 --> 09:48.190]  I don't hold in a dab for very long either.
[09:48.190 --> 09:50.110]  I think that you get what you need.
[09:50.110 --> 09:52.190]  I think you just get COPD from holding in smoke
[09:52.190 --> 09:53.390]  for too long, that's all you're gonna get.
[09:53.390 --> 09:55.590]  I think you absorb what you're gonna absorb.
[09:55.590 --> 09:56.590]  Unless you take a giant dab,
[09:56.590 --> 09:58.430]  then I think some of it may stick to my lungs
[09:58.430 --> 09:59.950]  and I just absorb it slowly over time
[09:59.950 --> 10:01.410]  as my lungs eat it up.
[10:01.410 --> 10:02.470]  Let me get back on track.
[10:02.470 --> 10:05.630]  This says, inhalation other than vaping.
[10:05.630 --> 10:08.510]  Then it says, when consuming regulated marijuana concentrate
[10:08.510 --> 10:10.550]  by inhalation other than vaping.
[10:10.550 --> 10:12.470]  Then it says, an example, dabbing.
[10:12.470 --> 10:14.910]  The recommended serving size is a sphere
[10:14.950 --> 10:18.190]  with the diameter no larger than the dot below.
[10:18.190 --> 10:20.070]  And I'm gonna show you the dot here.
[10:20.070 --> 10:21.730]  I'm gonna hold this up as close to that camera
[10:21.730 --> 10:23.150]  as I can get it from my seat
[10:23.150 --> 10:24.630]  without messing everything up.
[10:24.630 --> 10:26.230]  But look at the size of the dot.
[10:34.940 --> 10:36.420]  I tried to move that around a couple of times
[10:36.420 --> 10:40.380]  to where I can find an edible, edited, editable.
[10:40.380 --> 10:42.340]  Do you say editable quickly?
[10:42.340 --> 10:44.580]  A spot where I can edit to where we can put that picture
[10:44.580 --> 10:45.660]  and they're really good and you can see it.
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.500]  Maybe we could blow it up.
[10:46.500 --> 10:48.340]  Maybe I'll pick a picture of it and drop it in.
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.200]  But that dot that's on there is not a very big dot.
[10:51.200 --> 10:54.360]  They want you to do a dab that is that size in diameter,
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.840]  like a full ball of, most people that might get you high.
[10:57.840 --> 10:59.880]  But for me, that's gonna make me wish
[10:59.880 --> 11:02.400]  that you would give me a dab is all that's gonna do.
[11:02.400 --> 11:04.000]  So they're telling you to inhale
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.480]  for one inhalation lasting two seconds.
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.200]  And that's if you're vaping.
[11:08.200 --> 11:10.560]  All right, and then inhalation,
[11:10.560 --> 11:13.280]  the serving size is sphere no larger than the dot below.
[11:13.280 --> 11:15.840]  Then it says, risks and precautions.
[11:15.840 --> 11:18.240]  This is the part where I got excited here.
[11:18.320 --> 11:21.960]  Use of marijuana concentrate may lead to psychotic symptoms
[11:21.960 --> 11:23.920]  and or psychotic disorder,
[11:23.920 --> 11:27.560]  including but not limited to delusions,
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.560]  hallucinations or difficulty distinguishing reality.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.120]  That's fucking extreme.
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.560]  You've got to, what are you dabbing?
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.000]  Can I get some of that?
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.440]  Whatever made that person get delusions,
[11:39.440 --> 11:42.720]  hallucinations and difficulty distinguishing reality.
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.800]  May I please, I'll take a gram.
[11:44.800 --> 11:46.280]  I'll take a four gram jar.
[11:46.280 --> 11:47.380]  I'll pay cash.
[11:47.380 --> 11:48.260]  Where do we go from here?
[11:48.260 --> 11:50.580]  Mental health symptoms and problems.
[11:50.580 --> 11:51.620]  It doesn't list any of those,
[11:51.620 --> 11:53.840]  but it gives you the thing that it looks like
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.120]  there's more coming after that,
[11:55.120 --> 11:57.300]  but there's no stuff coming after that.
[11:57.300 --> 12:00.380]  Then it says, cannabis, hyperamesis.
[12:00.380 --> 12:01.220]  Did I say that right?
[12:01.220 --> 12:03.740]  That might be the first time I ever said that correctly.
[12:03.740 --> 12:06.220]  Cannabis, hyperamesis syndrome or CHS,
[12:06.220 --> 12:08.980]  which is known as uncontrolled and repetitive vomiting.
[12:10.240 --> 12:12.000]  I think that's pesticide exposure.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.780]  I'm not a scientist, a Scientologist, a doctor.
[12:14.780 --> 12:16.140]  I just have a podcast.
[12:16.140 --> 12:18.500]  I did stay at a Holiday Inn one time,
[12:18.500 --> 12:22.980]  but I really think CHS is probably most likely
[12:22.980 --> 12:25.580]  a pesticide exposure.
[12:25.580 --> 12:26.840]  I could be wrong.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.220]  Let's keep moving.
[12:28.220 --> 12:31.400]  Then it says, cannabis use disorder and dependence,
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.740]  including physical and psychological dependence.
[12:35.740 --> 12:37.580]  So they're warning you that you may,
[12:37.580 --> 12:40.120]  you just may get addicted to dabbing, bro.
[12:41.900 --> 12:43.500]  I don't see that happening.
[12:43.500 --> 12:45.180]  People, I don't think you get addicted to dabbing.
[12:45.180 --> 12:46.020]  You may enjoy it.
[12:46.840 --> 12:47.820]  You may want to do it a lot, but it does.
[12:47.820 --> 12:50.420]  In my opinion, I don't know anybody.
[12:50.420 --> 12:52.500]  Once again, I'm not a behavioral therapist.
[12:52.500 --> 12:54.540]  I'm not an addictive medicine specialist.
[12:54.540 --> 12:56.180]  We got to call in Dr. Drew for that.
[12:56.180 --> 12:58.660]  I do, however, maybe I am addicted
[12:58.660 --> 13:00.140]  since I'm justifying shit here.
[13:00.140 --> 13:01.800]  I do take breaks and I was going to encourage you
[13:01.800 --> 13:03.740]  to take breaks occasionally.
[13:03.740 --> 13:05.060]  If you follow my social media,
[13:05.060 --> 13:06.660]  if you watch my Instagram live,
[13:06.660 --> 13:10.980]  you watched last year, I took a couple of one week breaks
[13:10.980 --> 13:12.300]  and then I took a 12 day break
[13:12.300 --> 13:15.180]  where I didn't smoke any cannabis or eat any edibles
[13:15.180 --> 13:16.500]  for a stretch of 10 days.
[13:16.500 --> 13:18.580]  And then it was one week, it was seven days.
[13:18.580 --> 13:19.740]  And then I went for 10 days.
[13:19.740 --> 13:21.400]  And at the end of 10 days, I said, well, that was fun.
[13:21.400 --> 13:22.460]  Let's just keep going.
[13:22.460 --> 13:23.980]  I went for 12 days.
[13:23.980 --> 13:26.060]  Then I just wanted to smoke just because I wanted to,
[13:26.060 --> 13:27.780]  but maybe just check yourself occasionally,
[13:27.780 --> 13:30.780]  take a little break, see if that's something you need to do.
[13:30.780 --> 13:33.560]  Also, I consume medical cannabis
[13:33.560 --> 13:35.820]  and would you stop taking your medicine?
[13:35.820 --> 13:37.180]  Do you need a break from your medicine?
[13:37.180 --> 13:39.600]  The things that make you not sick or something like that?
[13:39.600 --> 13:40.540]  That's kind of the way I see it,
[13:40.540 --> 13:42.460]  but I do take breaks occasionally.
[13:42.460 --> 13:43.800]  It's always fun to clean out the system.
[13:43.800 --> 13:45.240]  You don't smoke for 10 days.
[13:45.240 --> 13:48.520]  And then when you do take a dab, it is fucking tremendous.
[13:48.520 --> 13:49.760]  You do notice that one.
[13:49.760 --> 13:51.100]  All right, let me get myself back on track.
[13:51.100 --> 13:51.940]  There's more to this paper.
[13:51.940 --> 13:53.400]  We'll wrap this up and then start talking
[13:53.400 --> 13:54.720]  about male plants here.
[13:54.720 --> 13:56.000]  Next up on the paper, it says,
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.020]  consuming concentrates via inhalation
[13:58.020 --> 14:00.120]  will cause immediate effects.
[14:00.120 --> 14:01.280]  That is accurate.
[14:01.280 --> 14:02.120]  That's accurate.
[14:02.120 --> 14:03.280]  I feel like when I take a dab,
[14:03.280 --> 14:04.880]  if I take the appropriate size dab,
[14:04.880 --> 14:08.180]  by the time I'm done blowing it out, I'm like, oh, I'm high.
[14:08.180 --> 14:09.020]  There it is.
[14:09.020 --> 14:10.360]  Like, booyah, it got me.
[14:10.360 --> 14:12.280]  And then I got to let that dab kind of sink in
[14:12.280 --> 14:14.400]  for a few minutes and let that immediate part of the dab
[14:14.400 --> 14:16.120]  kind of wear off, because it could be overwhelming
[14:16.120 --> 14:17.520]  when you take a monster dab.
[14:17.520 --> 14:18.360]  So that is accurate.
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.760]  It does come on immediately.
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.720]  Then it says, marijuana concentrates, and this is in bold,
[14:23.720 --> 14:26.040]  marijuana concentrates are not recommended
[14:26.040 --> 14:28.680]  for inexperienced marijuana users.
[14:28.680 --> 14:30.400]  Then back to our normal size font.
[14:30.400 --> 14:33.200]  THC concentration, amount of concentrate consumed
[14:33.200 --> 14:35.680]  and frequency of use can result in both short-term
[14:35.680 --> 14:37.340]  and long-term effects.
[14:37.340 --> 14:39.200]  There's moderate evidence that individuals
[14:39.200 --> 14:41.600]  who use marijuana with THC concentration
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.220]  greater than 10% are more likely than non-users
[14:44.220 --> 14:46.360]  to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.920]  such as schizophrenia.
[14:48.780 --> 14:50.520]  And they said, ah, loose, right?
[14:50.520 --> 14:53.200]  They did say there's moderate evidence.
[14:53.200 --> 14:54.760]  They don't have solid evidence.
[14:54.760 --> 14:56.760]  It kind of looks like this.
[14:56.760 --> 14:57.600]  That's what they're saying.
[14:57.600 --> 14:59.360]  That's not fucking real evidence.
[14:59.360 --> 15:01.640]  And then it says, marijuana concentrate is not approved
[15:01.640 --> 15:03.680]  by the FDA and claims of medical benefits
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.040]  are not supported by the FDA.
[15:05.040 --> 15:06.260]  That makes good sense.
[15:06.260 --> 15:08.680]  You got to put that in there for legal bullshit.
[15:08.680 --> 15:10.560]  Marijuana concentrates are not recommended
[15:10.560 --> 15:12.600]  for anyone under the age of 25,
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.440]  except if recommended by a doctor.
[15:14.440 --> 15:17.720]  People under 25 may be at greater risk of potential harm
[15:17.720 --> 15:20.800]  because the brain is not fully developed.
[15:20.800 --> 15:22.560]  So they don't want you dabbing until you're 25.
[15:22.560 --> 15:23.840]  Sorry, kid, you got to quit dabbing.
[15:23.840 --> 15:25.400]  You got to wait a couple of years.
[15:25.400 --> 15:26.320]  Keep doing your thing.
[15:26.320 --> 15:28.280]  Then it says regulated marijuana stores
[15:28.280 --> 15:30.500]  cannot provide medical advice.
[15:30.500 --> 15:33.460]  I actually, I like that.
[15:34.320 --> 15:35.900]  They're not doctors, they're bud tenders.
[15:35.900 --> 15:38.160]  Most of them are just 20 something year old chicks
[15:38.160 --> 15:40.280]  and bros that definitely have no qualification
[15:41.000 --> 15:41.840]  to give any medical advice.
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.680]  Don't go in there and ask them
[15:42.680 --> 15:44.160]  what to smoke for your seizures.
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.000]  Don't do that.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.440]  Do your own research, find the strains that work for you.
[15:46.440 --> 15:47.960]  Don't rely on those folks.
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.080]  Don't put that pressure on them.
[15:49.080 --> 15:49.920]  Don't do that.
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.920]  Don't put your devil magic on me, Ricky Bobby.
[15:51.920 --> 15:53.760]  Then it says any questions related to the health
[15:53.760 --> 15:55.520]  or safety of marijuana concentrates
[15:55.520 --> 15:58.080]  should be discussed with a patient's recommending physician
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.280]  or an adult consumer's primary care physician.
[16:02.280 --> 16:04.000]  And then it has a little disclaimer on the bottom.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.760]  This will be what we wrap up with.
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.440]  The risks are, these risks are based on Colorado
[16:08.440 --> 16:09.920]  Department of Public Health and Environment
[16:10.560 --> 16:12.120]  evidence statements where there is either moderate
[16:12.120 --> 16:13.200]  or substantial evidence.
[16:13.200 --> 16:15.840]  Where moderate means strong scientific findings
[16:15.840 --> 16:17.320]  that support the outcome, but these findings
[16:17.320 --> 16:20.000]  have some limitations and substantial means.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.280]  Robust scientific findings that support the outcome
[16:22.280 --> 16:24.280]  with no credible opposing scientific evidence.
[16:24.280 --> 16:26.880]  That's a lot of scientific gibberish that means
[16:26.880 --> 16:28.680]  we did a study and nobody challenged it.
[16:28.680 --> 16:31.240]  Is what I think, no credible opposing scientific,
[16:31.240 --> 16:32.600]  yeah, nobody challenged it.
[16:32.600 --> 16:34.600]  That's what I think that says.
[16:34.600 --> 16:37.160]  On the other side it says the following statements
[16:37.160 --> 16:39.480]  must be included on every container of marijuana
[16:40.040 --> 16:40.880]  and then it shows you some regulations
[16:40.880 --> 16:43.440]  and some other things and some other stuff
[16:43.440 --> 16:44.960]  that doesn't really matter on this one.
[16:44.960 --> 16:48.120]  Then on the back here we have a bunch of reporting agencies.
[16:48.120 --> 16:50.800]  The Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center,
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.400]  Suicide Prevention Line, Youth and Marijuana,
[16:54.400 --> 16:56.440]  just weird propaganda phone numbers on the back here.
[16:56.440 --> 16:57.920]  If you do have some problems with something like that,
[16:57.920 --> 16:59.000]  please do reach out to somebody.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.080]  Take care of your mental and physical well-being
[17:01.080 --> 17:03.720]  and if somebody you know is in immediate,
[17:03.720 --> 17:05.120]  imminent danger, please do reach out
[17:05.120 --> 17:06.600]  and get them the proper care.
[17:06.600 --> 17:09.360]  That's a responsible thing to say as an adult with a show.
[17:10.200 --> 17:11.040]  There's a lot of stuff here on the back
[17:11.040 --> 17:13.280]  that I really honestly found this to be entertaining.
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.520]  When he handed it to me, he's like,
[17:14.520 --> 17:16.200]  here bro, I have to give you this when you dab.
[17:16.200 --> 17:18.680]  I was like, bro, we've been buying dabs for years
[17:18.680 --> 17:20.480]  and they just now realized we needed
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.840]  a little propaganda pamphlet.
[17:22.840 --> 17:24.000]  Pretty funny, pretty cool.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.120]  Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[17:25.120 --> 17:26.520]  I'm gonna take a quick drink,
[17:26.520 --> 17:29.000]  then we're gonna talk about a mail plant question
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.160]  that I got from our friends on YouTube.
[17:34.670 --> 17:36.350]  All right, as promised, I took a drink
[17:36.350 --> 17:38.710]  and now I am back to talk about a mail question
[17:38.710 --> 17:40.590]  that I did get from YouTube.
[17:41.430 --> 17:42.270]  Most of the time, I don't check a lot
[17:42.270 --> 17:43.750]  of the YouTube comments and answer a lot of the questions
[17:43.750 --> 17:45.510]  from there because I prefer them to come in an email.
[17:45.510 --> 17:47.030]  It's easier to print and manage.
[17:47.030 --> 17:48.990]  However, this one did get my attention.
[17:49.910 --> 17:51.190]  It goes a lot like this.
[17:51.190 --> 17:52.950]  First of all, it came from Be Real,
[17:52.950 --> 17:54.230]  but not the original Be Real.
[17:54.230 --> 17:57.310]  It is B-E-E Real, the other Be Real.
[17:57.310 --> 18:00.350]  And it says, how do you measure the potency of a mail plant?
[18:00.350 --> 18:02.030]  That's a very good question.
[18:02.030 --> 18:04.070]  With a female plant, we get buds, we get flowers.
[18:04.070 --> 18:06.430]  You dry them, cure them, smoke them, enjoy them.
[18:06.430 --> 18:08.270]  Then you go, that one's good, that one's not as good,
[18:08.270 --> 18:09.390]  that one tastes good.
[18:09.390 --> 18:11.270]  You get your own judgment, your own opinions.
[18:11.270 --> 18:13.630]  Or you can take it to the lab, that's always an option.
[18:13.630 --> 18:16.390]  But you don't get that option with a male plant.
[18:16.390 --> 18:17.910]  There's a different process with that.
[18:17.910 --> 18:18.990]  I do have a bunch of notes here.
[18:18.990 --> 18:20.150]  Let me keep myself on track
[18:20.150 --> 18:22.990]  because I do like to start rambling, talk over my notes.
[18:22.990 --> 18:24.470]  So mail potency question,
[18:24.470 --> 18:25.870]  how do you measure the potency of a mail?
[18:25.870 --> 18:28.950]  The first thing I do when I'm growing a mail plant
[18:28.950 --> 18:30.510]  and looking to work with the mail plant
[18:30.510 --> 18:32.230]  is it's always a visual inspection.
[18:32.230 --> 18:33.050]  You gotta look at it.
[18:33.050 --> 18:33.890]  What does it look like?
[18:33.890 --> 18:35.190]  Does it have the traits you're looking for?
[18:35.190 --> 18:38.310]  Does it reach the criteria, meet the criteria
[18:38.310 --> 18:39.750]  which you have set for that mail plant?
[18:39.750 --> 18:40.590]  What's your goal?
[18:40.590 --> 18:41.410]  What are you trying to do?
[18:41.410 --> 18:44.870]  Now potency, if it makes trichomes, it's gonna be potent.
[18:44.870 --> 18:46.910]  That's one of the visual cues for potency,
[18:46.910 --> 18:48.390]  probably the main visual cue.
[18:48.390 --> 18:50.290]  But make sure it's got all the other criteria.
[18:50.290 --> 18:52.990]  Potency isn't the only thing that you're looking for
[18:52.990 --> 18:53.870]  when it comes to a mail.
[18:53.870 --> 18:56.790]  You need structure, vigor, shape,
[18:56.790 --> 18:59.510]  resistance to pathogens, resistance to bugs,
[19:00.750 --> 19:04.350]  appropriate flowering time, amount of pollen that it dumps.
[19:04.350 --> 19:05.710]  There's a lot of other things to think about.
[19:05.710 --> 19:07.350]  I've done a lot of shows about that.
[19:07.350 --> 19:08.750]  So visually look at the plant.
[19:08.750 --> 19:10.110]  Make sure it's something you wanna work with.
[19:10.110 --> 19:11.130]  Do you see trichomes?
[19:11.130 --> 19:14.890]  That is going to be a good indicator of a nice, potent mail.
[19:14.890 --> 19:16.350]  Now, the next step,
[19:16.350 --> 19:17.950]  since we don't get to smoke the mail plant,
[19:17.950 --> 19:20.250]  I mean, you can, but DJ Short does it.
[19:20.250 --> 19:21.090]  That's not my style.
[19:21.090 --> 19:22.070]  I don't wanna smoke the mail plants.
[19:22.070 --> 19:23.590]  I don't wanna drive out and smoke them.
[19:23.590 --> 19:25.430]  I, instead, I do this.
[19:25.430 --> 19:27.450]  I find multiple female plants.
[19:27.450 --> 19:28.550]  I've got one mail plant,
[19:28.550 --> 19:30.030]  a dude that I think is gonna be good.
[19:30.030 --> 19:31.430]  This is why breeding takes a while.
[19:31.430 --> 19:33.150]  This is why selection takes a minute.
[19:33.150 --> 19:34.670]  This is why seeds are expensive.
[19:34.670 --> 19:36.830]  You find one mail plant that you wanna work with.
[19:37.350 --> 19:38.590]  This is at least how I would.
[19:38.590 --> 19:39.870]  So I'd grow a few mails.
[19:39.870 --> 19:42.030]  I'd grow a few mails and I'd look visually
[19:42.030 --> 19:43.950]  and I'd pick one out of those.
[19:43.950 --> 19:45.310]  And that one that I selected,
[19:45.310 --> 19:46.310]  all the others would be gone.
[19:46.310 --> 19:47.550]  All the pollen would be cleaned up.
[19:47.550 --> 19:49.830]  Now, if you've got a fresh room with one mail plant,
[19:49.830 --> 19:52.870]  I would introduce multiple female plants
[19:52.870 --> 19:54.750]  of different genetics.
[19:54.750 --> 19:56.530]  There'd be like, in my case,
[19:56.530 --> 19:58.510]  it'd probably be a strawberry starburst plant,
[19:58.510 --> 20:00.710]  a sun kiss plant, a blueberry cookies plant,
[20:00.710 --> 20:02.230]  a lemon skunk plant.
[20:02.230 --> 20:05.350]  Those plants are all different enough in growth,
[20:05.350 --> 20:09.310]  flavor, aroma, leaf shape, plant structure,
[20:09.310 --> 20:11.630]  that I can tell what the mail plant is going to add
[20:11.630 --> 20:13.530]  when I breed to those.
[20:13.530 --> 20:16.190]  So I would pollinate several female plants
[20:16.190 --> 20:18.270]  that are different in lots of ways,
[20:18.270 --> 20:22.230]  visually, aromatically, buzz-wise, flowering times,
[20:22.230 --> 20:23.630]  so that we can kind of,
[20:23.630 --> 20:25.710]  what we're trying to do is we're mixing this paint
[20:25.710 --> 20:28.510]  with other colors to see what other colors we create.
[20:28.510 --> 20:29.450]  That's really what we're doing,
[20:29.450 --> 20:32.070]  but we wanna be able to see the other colors
[20:32.070 --> 20:33.350]  and we wanna see what mixes,
[20:33.350 --> 20:35.070]  what these two colors mix like.
[20:35.790 --> 20:36.630]  So we're trying to put reds and blues together
[20:36.630 --> 20:37.450]  to get purple.
[20:37.450 --> 20:38.430]  If you put a bunch of purple together,
[20:38.430 --> 20:40.230]  you're just gonna get more fucking purple
[20:40.230 --> 20:41.430]  and you won't know what happened.
[20:41.430 --> 20:43.710]  So try to find reds, try to find blues,
[20:43.710 --> 20:45.030]  try to find things that are opposite
[20:45.030 --> 20:47.110]  so we can blend those, breed those together
[20:47.110 --> 20:48.210]  and see what we've created.
[20:48.210 --> 20:49.790]  So the first step, pollinate.
[20:49.790 --> 20:51.790]  No, first step, selection.
[20:51.790 --> 20:55.470]  Select males, select females, do a pollination.
[20:55.470 --> 20:58.150]  One male to several female plants.
[20:58.150 --> 21:01.110]  Finish them, gather the seeds, keep the seeds separate.
[21:01.110 --> 21:02.830]  The seeds that came out of the strawberry plant,
[21:02.830 --> 21:03.770]  they're staying over here.
[21:03.770 --> 21:05.330]  The seeds that came out of the sun kiss,
[21:05.330 --> 21:06.170]  staying over here.
[21:06.170 --> 21:07.670]  Seeds that came out of blueberry cookies,
[21:07.670 --> 21:08.510]  staying over here.
[21:08.510 --> 21:09.370]  Same with all the way down the line.
[21:09.370 --> 21:11.230]  I think lemon skunk was the other one I said.
[21:11.230 --> 21:12.610]  We're gonna keep all those seeds separate,
[21:12.610 --> 21:14.690]  labeled, sealed, safe, secure.
[21:14.690 --> 21:16.970]  Then I'm gonna grow as many as I can
[21:16.970 --> 21:19.250]  of each one of those batches of seeds
[21:19.250 --> 21:22.270]  in the same, as close to the same environment
[21:22.270 --> 21:23.290]  as I possibly can.
[21:23.290 --> 21:26.170]  I'm gonna try to get somewhere between 10 and 100 seeds.
[21:26.170 --> 21:28.810]  We're just gonna say the blueberry cookies to our new male.
[21:28.810 --> 21:30.530]  I'm gonna bust out 100 seeds of those
[21:30.530 --> 21:32.490]  and grow them and see what I get.
[21:32.490 --> 21:33.650]  I'm gonna take a lot of notes.
[21:34.610 --> 21:35.930]  I'm gonna note the growth structure,
[21:35.930 --> 21:37.550]  the speed of the growth, the leaf shape,
[21:37.550 --> 21:40.770]  the shape of the plant, different phenotypes that I see.
[21:40.770 --> 21:41.730]  I'm just gonna make notes.
[21:41.730 --> 21:43.330]  Are there any weird anomalies?
[21:43.330 --> 21:46.470]  Are there any weird mutations or strange things
[21:46.470 --> 21:48.370]  that I notice in that batch?
[21:48.370 --> 21:50.290]  Make all of the notes you can think about.
[21:50.290 --> 21:52.230]  Then, once you've grown that batch,
[21:52.230 --> 21:53.770]  run another batch of something different.
[21:53.770 --> 21:54.810]  I said the blueberry this time.
[21:54.810 --> 21:56.050]  Let's do the strawberry next time
[21:56.050 --> 21:57.130]  because that's gonna be way different.
[21:57.130 --> 21:59.450]  You got blueberry and kind of funky Skittles
[21:59.450 --> 22:01.890]  and you got sweet strawberry, bubblegum, watermelon.
[22:01.890 --> 22:02.730]  Let's do that one.
[22:02.730 --> 22:04.570]  Run the strawberry to our new male.
[22:04.570 --> 22:07.490]  Once again, look for anomalies, look for growth structure,
[22:07.490 --> 22:10.650]  look for shape, look for any sort of things that stand out.
[22:10.650 --> 22:13.250]  Document everything that you can.
[22:13.250 --> 22:14.890]  We're gonna do this with all of the seeds
[22:14.890 --> 22:16.610]  that we have made with every batch,
[22:16.610 --> 22:20.770]  the strawberry, blueberry, sunkiss, and the lemon skunk.
[22:20.770 --> 22:22.650]  And now what we're gonna start to see
[22:22.650 --> 22:26.130]  is what that male adds to the mix with each plant
[22:26.130 --> 22:28.270]  because if you only pollinate one plant,
[22:28.270 --> 22:30.250]  then you only know it's kind of a,
[22:30.250 --> 22:32.010]  what is it, a 50-50 crapshoot.
[22:32.010 --> 22:33.450]  Maybe that's what it does.
[22:33.450 --> 22:35.650]  But if you pollinate multiple different females,
[22:35.650 --> 22:38.990]  then you can see what that male does,
[22:38.990 --> 22:40.770]  what it provides, what it offers
[22:40.770 --> 22:43.050]  to other female plants when you breed to it
[22:43.050 --> 22:45.430]  because it's all about the combination of what comes out.
[22:45.430 --> 22:49.850]  We want a new plant that outperforms the original plant
[22:49.850 --> 22:52.350]  in a couple of ways, but we also need vigor,
[22:52.350 --> 22:55.750]  structure, resistance, potency, aroma.
[22:55.750 --> 22:58.050]  We need all of that stuff and it needs to be better
[22:58.050 --> 22:59.690]  than the original plant we started with
[22:59.690 --> 23:01.830]  or we're not doing the plant any good.
[23:02.790 --> 23:04.230]  So, let's take a look at some of the things
[23:04.230 --> 23:06.430]  that are happening in the evolution of cannabis.
[23:06.430 --> 23:09.110]  So, pollinate a bunch of females, grow them out,
[23:09.110 --> 23:11.270]  then take a lot of notes and see what you've got.
[23:11.270 --> 23:14.030]  Then compare your notes as the grower, as the breeder.
[23:14.030 --> 23:16.470]  This will start coming to you naturally as you're doing it.
[23:16.470 --> 23:19.470]  You'll say, oh, I added, let's just say that your male,
[23:19.470 --> 23:21.470]  maybe I'm gonna say that it had chocolate.
[23:21.470 --> 23:22.550]  We're just gonna guess chocolate.
[23:22.550 --> 23:24.150]  Chocolate's a good flavor, a good trait,
[23:24.150 --> 23:25.630]  something we would all enjoy.
[23:25.630 --> 23:27.430]  We're gonna say that male adds chocolate.
[23:27.430 --> 23:29.950]  We don't know that yet, but we're going to breed
[23:29.950 --> 23:32.830]  orange and lemon, padau, it happened, now we grow it.
[23:32.830 --> 23:34.630]  Now we're starting to get, in the blueberry,
[23:34.630 --> 23:38.470]  I noticed like a chocolate, dark chocolate, blueberry,
[23:38.470 --> 23:39.950]  peanut butter sort of a smell going on.
[23:39.950 --> 23:40.790]  That's kind of interesting.
[23:40.790 --> 23:42.710]  Some of the phenotypes have a lot of chocolate in them.
[23:42.710 --> 23:45.470]  I grew the strawberry out, got a lot of strawberry turps.
[23:45.470 --> 23:47.470]  There's some watermelon turps like we expected,
[23:47.470 --> 23:49.710]  but then some of them have chocolate.
[23:49.710 --> 23:50.550]  Hey, guess what?
[23:50.550 --> 23:53.030]  I wonder if that male is contributing chocolate turps.
[23:53.030 --> 23:54.270]  Is that what it's doing?
[23:54.270 --> 23:57.070]  Also, I noticed that they all grow super wildly tall.
[23:57.070 --> 23:58.590]  Is that what the male's doing?
[23:58.590 --> 24:00.310]  You'll start noticing commonalities
[24:00.310 --> 24:02.590]  amongst the different crosses that you've made,
[24:02.590 --> 24:05.350]  and that's how you identify what the male is doing.
[24:05.350 --> 24:07.550]  You'll start noticing when I cross it to the lemon skunk
[24:07.550 --> 24:10.230]  that I get chocolate and lemons, and that's how you say,
[24:10.230 --> 24:12.930]  oh, maybe that plant puts out chocolate turps,
[24:12.930 --> 24:15.430]  or maybe it makes, I said a minute ago, it gets really tall,
[24:15.430 --> 24:17.710]  or maybe you'll notice that everything you bred it to
[24:17.710 --> 24:19.710]  flowers super quickly.
[24:19.710 --> 24:21.510]  Also, there could be negative traits.
[24:21.510 --> 24:23.730]  Sometimes the male plants, if they don't get enough light,
[24:23.730 --> 24:25.630]  if they start to get root bound, if they get thirsty,
[24:25.630 --> 24:28.070]  if they get overfed, they'll just start auto flowering
[24:28.070 --> 24:29.510]  without you telling them to.
[24:29.510 --> 24:30.990]  That's a problem for a male plant
[24:30.990 --> 24:33.550]  because that trait will be passed on to its progeny.
[24:33.550 --> 24:34.950]  Those plants will start flowering
[24:34.950 --> 24:36.790]  whenever there's a problem, and your customers,
[24:36.790 --> 24:38.870]  or you, or whoever ends up with those seeds
[24:38.870 --> 24:41.410]  will not be happy with that if they're looking for
[24:41.410 --> 24:43.430]  a regular photo period plant.
[24:43.430 --> 24:46.430]  So, the best way to do it, pollinate them.
[24:46.430 --> 24:49.190]  Pollinate a bunch of females, keep the seeds separate,
[24:49.190 --> 24:52.610]  grow them, observe, take notes, then find commonalities
[24:52.610 --> 24:54.790]  to see what that male plant is doing.
[24:54.790 --> 24:57.890]  I know it sounds like a lot of work, and it is.
[24:58.710 --> 25:00.570]  Each pollination is going just to veg and flower the plants.
[25:00.570 --> 25:02.250]  You got 100 days right there.
[25:02.250 --> 25:03.650]  Then you've gotta grow out those seeds.
[25:03.650 --> 25:05.690]  There's another 100 days right there.
[25:05.690 --> 25:06.990]  Depending on how many you can grow,
[25:06.990 --> 25:08.370]  you've gotta do multiple cycles.
[25:08.370 --> 25:10.050]  So, that could take you quite a while.
[25:10.050 --> 25:11.390]  That's why seeds are expensive.
[25:11.390 --> 25:14.070]  That's why breeders charge money for our work.
[25:14.070 --> 25:15.970]  That's why we ask for a compensation
[25:15.970 --> 25:16.930]  for the seeds we give you.
[25:16.930 --> 25:18.770]  That's how we build a reputation,
[25:18.770 --> 25:20.610]  is by doing that work and putting out seeds
[25:20.610 --> 25:22.010]  that we know will be reliable,
[25:22.010 --> 25:23.650]  that you have shown a track record
[25:23.650 --> 25:25.970]  that we do make good selections with.
[25:25.970 --> 25:27.150]  Let me get back on my notes.
[25:27.510 --> 25:29.070]  Let's see, visually, pollinate, grow the seeds,
[25:29.070 --> 25:30.630]  find the females, finish them.
[25:30.630 --> 25:32.510]  Oh yeah, here's one of the best parts.
[25:32.510 --> 25:33.350]  Smoke them.
[25:33.350 --> 25:34.550]  You get to grow out these plants,
[25:34.550 --> 25:36.390]  these female plants that you just made,
[25:36.390 --> 25:37.910]  and you get to smoke them.
[25:37.910 --> 25:40.910]  That's how we find out what is really the best.
[25:40.910 --> 25:43.650]  Now, here's what you have to do next.
[25:43.650 --> 25:44.630]  Once you've got a bunch of seeds,
[25:44.630 --> 25:45.470]  and you've grown them and smoked them,
[25:45.470 --> 25:46.830]  you have to do it again with a different male
[25:46.830 --> 25:48.010]  and see which one's better.
[25:48.010 --> 25:49.910]  That's a whole nother, what did I say,
[25:49.910 --> 25:51.470]  300 days worth of research.
[25:51.470 --> 25:53.170]  Now, we're already at two years into this project,
[25:53.170 --> 25:54.710]  just finding a male plant.
[25:54.710 --> 25:56.110]  That's why seeds get expensive.
[25:56.110 --> 25:59.350]  So you get to grow them, then you get to smoke them,
[25:59.350 --> 26:01.070]  and then you get to find out what those traits are
[26:01.070 --> 26:02.470]  that were passed along.
[26:02.470 --> 26:05.670]  There are some other options that you can do.
[26:05.670 --> 26:08.830]  You can send your male plant to the lab,
[26:08.830 --> 26:10.650]  and they can test your male plant
[26:10.650 --> 26:13.790]  for the presence of cannabinoid precursors.
[26:13.790 --> 26:15.630]  You can also test your finished plant.
[26:15.630 --> 26:17.210]  If you've got a male plant that kicks off flowers,
[26:17.210 --> 26:19.730]  you can send it to the lab for testing for potency.
[26:19.730 --> 26:21.310]  That is a thing.
[26:21.310 --> 26:25.650]  You could get precursor plants from multiple male plants
[26:26.170 --> 26:27.610]  and send those to the lab and test for the presence
[26:27.610 --> 26:30.010]  of cannabinoid precursors in your males,
[26:30.010 --> 26:34.210]  and that may help you speed up your selection process.
[26:34.210 --> 26:37.570]  You could do precursory tests on males and females.
[26:37.570 --> 26:39.090]  That'll definitely speed up your process.
[26:39.090 --> 26:40.710]  Should we talk about that a little bit?
[26:40.710 --> 26:42.090]  Does that make any sense?
[26:42.090 --> 26:45.490]  What we're able to do, let's just say we're looking,
[26:45.490 --> 26:46.450]  we're gonna breed plants,
[26:46.450 --> 26:48.910]  and I'm looking for a female plant that is super,
[26:48.910 --> 26:51.850]  well, I'm looking for only plants that are super high in THC.
[26:51.850 --> 26:55.210]  That's a silly goal, but with this project,
[26:55.770 --> 26:57.410]  it will work for what I'm gonna talk about.
[26:58.370 --> 27:00.170]  We would grow these plants until we were big enough
[27:00.170 --> 27:01.690]  to get a leaf sample.
[27:01.690 --> 27:03.130]  I only need two true leaves.
[27:03.130 --> 27:05.050]  Once these plants have two true leaves,
[27:05.050 --> 27:07.970]  I take a sample that is the size of the back end
[27:07.970 --> 27:10.050]  of this pin, the part you click, the annoying part.
[27:10.050 --> 27:12.410]  I need a sample that big from each plant.
[27:12.410 --> 27:13.970]  We send that sample to a lab.
[27:13.970 --> 27:15.050]  They test it.
[27:15.050 --> 27:19.410]  That lab can identify the presence of the precursors
[27:19.410 --> 27:22.850]  that will later turn into THC,
[27:22.890 --> 27:26.090]  so it knows that the precursors to those cannabinoids
[27:26.090 --> 27:28.170]  are available in that plant.
[27:28.170 --> 27:30.550]  They will say, this plant shows markers
[27:30.550 --> 27:32.550]  that are high in the precursors.
[27:32.550 --> 27:33.970]  This plant's not so high in it.
[27:33.970 --> 27:35.810]  This plant is super high in it.
[27:35.810 --> 27:37.970]  At that point, if we were breeding for potency,
[27:37.970 --> 27:39.530]  what you would do is just eliminate
[27:39.530 --> 27:42.930]  all of the low testing number plants at that time.
[27:42.930 --> 27:44.570]  If you're looking for boys, looking for girls,
[27:44.570 --> 27:46.570]  you can run the test at the same time
[27:46.570 --> 27:47.890]  to find male and female.
[27:47.890 --> 27:49.890]  If you're looking for that highly potent female,
[27:49.890 --> 27:50.730]  you got her.
[27:50.730 --> 27:52.130]  If you're looking for that highly potent male,
[27:52.130 --> 27:52.970]  you got it.
[27:52.970 --> 27:55.010]  Now what you would do, what I would do,
[27:55.010 --> 27:57.770]  since I've already eliminated the low number of plants,
[27:57.770 --> 28:00.330]  I already know that my high potency plants are in the batch.
[28:00.330 --> 28:03.250]  Now I will look for structure, vigor, growth,
[28:03.250 --> 28:06.810]  aroma, color, resistance, all of the other things
[28:06.810 --> 28:10.170]  that may be desirable at this point for the plant.
[28:10.170 --> 28:11.650]  We already know that they're super potent,
[28:11.650 --> 28:13.210]  so now I'm phenohunting backwards.
[28:13.210 --> 28:14.490]  Now I don't have to smoke it.
[28:14.490 --> 28:17.290]  I've already eliminated a bunch of plants through science,
[28:17.290 --> 28:19.490]  through what is known as predicative testing,
[28:19.490 --> 28:23.130]  through looking for the presence of cannabinoid precursors.
[28:23.130 --> 28:25.270]  I would assume you could do that with the male plants.
[28:25.270 --> 28:27.450]  I don't know anybody that is doing that yet.
[28:27.450 --> 28:28.530]  You would be revolutionary.
[28:28.530 --> 28:30.050]  You would be the first.
[28:30.050 --> 28:33.450]  Send that bitch in, get it tested, see what pops up.
[28:33.450 --> 28:35.930]  Breed the same male to several females,
[28:35.930 --> 28:38.530]  and experience and see what that male does.
[28:38.530 --> 28:39.590]  Take notes and have fun.
[28:39.590 --> 28:42.070]  That is the last of my notes that I've got down.
[28:42.070 --> 28:43.650]  The most important part is that you have fun.
[28:43.650 --> 28:45.490]  If you're not having fun with your breeding projects,
[28:45.490 --> 28:46.610]  if you're stressing yourself out,
[28:46.610 --> 28:49.210]  if it's driving you crazy, take a big breath
[28:49.930 --> 28:51.890]  and step back, smoke some good weed,
[28:51.890 --> 28:54.410]  take some dabs, dab yourself into a state of,
[28:54.410 --> 28:57.170]  which word do we want to use, cannabis use disorder,
[28:57.170 --> 28:59.010]  or maybe get yourself some psychotic symptoms
[28:59.010 --> 29:01.510]  or psychotic disorder, walk around the block,
[29:01.510 --> 29:03.210]  giggle a couple times, think about it,
[29:03.210 --> 29:05.490]  snap out of it, then go back to the grow room,
[29:05.490 --> 29:07.650]  back to the drawing board, and have fun.
[29:07.650 --> 29:09.530]  Grow from your heart, breed with love.
[29:09.530 --> 29:11.610]  That is what it is all about.
[29:11.610 --> 29:13.930]  The goal here is to create plants that were better
[29:13.930 --> 29:15.510]  than the plants we started with.
[29:15.510 --> 29:18.010]  It sounds like you're very interested in breeding.
[29:18.010 --> 29:18.870]  This is a great question.
[29:19.530 --> 29:21.430]  I hope I gave you some good information here.
