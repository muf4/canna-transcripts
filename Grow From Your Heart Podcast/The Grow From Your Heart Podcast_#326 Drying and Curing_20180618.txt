[00:01.600 --> 00:04.760]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:04.760 --> 00:07.680]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:07.680 --> 00:11.240]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.640]  That's right. If you're a new grower,
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.000]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.280]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:16.280 --> 00:18.560]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's
[00:18.560 --> 00:20.800]  just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:20.800 --> 00:23.440]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:23.440 --> 00:25.680]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.680 --> 00:28.000]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.520]  the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[00:45.280 --> 00:49.400]  because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:49.400 --> 00:55.230]  Welcome to the show, Internet world.
[00:55.230 --> 00:58.430]  It is time for episode 326 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.430 --> 00:59.910]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:59.910 --> 01:03.830]  I have got a very detailed episode planned out for you.
[01:03.830 --> 01:05.870]  This is going to be the long awaited,
[01:05.870 --> 01:08.430]  long anticipated dry and cure episode.
[01:08.430 --> 01:10.590]  We have done an episode on determining ripeness.
[01:10.590 --> 01:13.310]  We did an episode on harvesting your plants.
[01:13.310 --> 01:16.310]  Now it is time to dry and cure our cannabis plants.
[01:16.310 --> 01:19.630]  Before we get there, let's cover a little bit of business.
[01:19.630 --> 01:21.590]  This episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:21.590 --> 01:24.070]  is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:24.070 --> 01:26.910]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[01:26.910 --> 01:29.030]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:29.030 --> 01:32.390]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:32.390 --> 01:36.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, please support my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:36.910 --> 01:40.990]  Also, this podcast is brought to you by our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[01:40.990 --> 01:43.550]  You should know what's going on in your grow room at all times,
[01:43.550 --> 01:46.510]  and you can pay close attention with the PL Grow Minder Unit.
[01:46.510 --> 01:51.270]  So check out my friends at PL Grow Systems at plgrow.systems.
[01:51.270 --> 01:52.990]  One more order of business.
[01:52.990 --> 01:55.830]  A lot of people let me know that the episode with Deb and Granny
[01:55.830 --> 01:58.830]  and Giddyup and Max had an audio issue.
[01:58.830 --> 02:01.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, that audio issue has been corrected.
[02:01.550 --> 02:03.470]  If you were frustrated listening to that show,
[02:03.470 --> 02:08.390]  I encourage you to go back and check out the corrected audio version of that podcast.
[02:08.390 --> 02:09.790]  Thanks for being patient with me,
[02:09.790 --> 02:15.670]  and big thanks to everybody who let me know there was a technical issue.
[02:15.670 --> 02:17.030]  And speaking of technical issues,
[02:17.030 --> 02:22.150]  I am still working with Stitcher to resolve the technical issues that happen randomly.
[02:22.150 --> 02:24.230]  Some episodes will play for some people,
[02:24.230 --> 02:26.750]  some episodes randomly will not play for people.
[02:26.750 --> 02:29.470]  The only people experiencing the technical issues
[02:29.470 --> 02:32.230]  are people who are listening to the podcast
[02:32.230 --> 02:35.590]  through the Stitcher application on an Android device.
[02:35.590 --> 02:37.910]  Sometimes it works for you, sometimes it doesn't.
[02:37.910 --> 02:39.310]  I'm not sure what's causing it.
[02:39.310 --> 02:40.550]  We thought we had it narrowed down,
[02:40.550 --> 02:41.990]  we corrected a couple of things,
[02:41.990 --> 02:43.310]  it has done it again.
[02:43.310 --> 02:46.430]  I will keep working at getting that resolved.
[02:46.430 --> 02:49.150]  If you can't listen to the episodes through Stitcher,
[02:49.150 --> 02:50.030]  through the application,
[02:50.030 --> 02:51.830]  you can always go to the Stitcher website.
[02:51.830 --> 02:53.190]  You can find the show there.
[02:53.190 --> 02:55.030]  Also, you can find the show on YouTube.
[02:55.030 --> 02:57.990]  I'm trying to keep all of the episodes updated on YouTube.
[02:58.030 --> 03:00.510]  So I apologize if Stitcher is fighting you.
[03:00.510 --> 03:01.870]  I am working on it.
[03:01.870 --> 03:04.630]  The tech team and the customer support team at Stitcher are helping me,
[03:04.630 --> 03:07.390]  and we cannot find the problem.
[03:07.390 --> 03:11.430]  Alright, I feel like I've gotten most of the technical business out of the way.
[03:11.430 --> 03:13.430]  Let's get into a podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13.430 --> 03:17.590]  You know I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[03:17.590 --> 03:21.230]  Today I've got the honor of dabbing some sauce made by a friend.
[03:21.230 --> 03:23.550]  This was locally grown and locally extracted.
[03:23.550 --> 03:25.030]  My buddy doesn't want to be mentioned on the show,
[03:25.030 --> 03:26.430]  so I'm not going to say his name.
[03:26.430 --> 03:27.950]  But dude, thanks for the great work.
[03:27.950 --> 03:29.230]  So my friend grew some cream.
[03:29.230 --> 03:30.670]  Of course, I bred the cream.
[03:30.670 --> 03:32.750]  The cream is cookies and cream to a rise.
[03:32.750 --> 03:34.390]  I passed along some seeds.
[03:34.390 --> 03:35.190]  He grew it.
[03:35.190 --> 03:36.190]  He harvested it.
[03:36.190 --> 03:38.310]  He extracted it and made sauce out of it.
[03:38.310 --> 03:41.390]  Then he was kind enough to bring me a couple of sample jars.
[03:41.390 --> 03:44.270]  And you guys, this stuff is tremendous.
[03:44.270 --> 03:46.110]  It's almost gone because it is so delicious.
[03:46.110 --> 03:49.590]  He brought me a little sample of straight isolated crystals.
[03:49.590 --> 03:52.590]  He brought me a little sample of straight isolated turps.
[03:52.590 --> 03:55.470]  And he also brought me a sample of the two combined.
[03:55.470 --> 03:57.470]  So I've got the turps, I've got the crystals,
[03:57.470 --> 03:59.390]  and then I've got the saucy mixture put together
[03:59.390 --> 04:01.190]  at a beautiful ratio.
[04:01.190 --> 04:06.550]  You guys, the mixture smells like cupcake frosting and cookie
[04:06.550 --> 04:07.390]  dough.
[04:07.390 --> 04:09.070]  And then when you take a dab of it,
[04:09.070 --> 04:11.470]  it tastes like you just took a big bite of cookie
[04:11.470 --> 04:13.150]  dough with cupcake frosting on it.
[04:13.150 --> 04:14.550]  And then when you blow it out, it
[04:14.550 --> 04:16.990]  smells like somebody's baking fresh cookies in the room.
[04:16.990 --> 04:19.830]  It smells like warm chocolate chip and cinnamon
[04:19.830 --> 04:21.590]  cookies filling the room.
[04:21.590 --> 04:23.510]  This concentrate is excellent.
[04:23.510 --> 04:25.070]  It is super smooth.
[04:25.070 --> 04:26.710]  I took a couple of gigantic dabs.
[04:26.710 --> 04:27.990]  There was no throat tingle.
[04:27.990 --> 04:29.750]  There was no heaviness on the exhale.
[04:29.750 --> 04:33.190]  Super smooth, super clean, super delicious concentrates.
[04:33.190 --> 04:35.630]  Dude, I know you don't want me to say your name on the air,
[04:35.630 --> 04:37.910]  but great product, great work.
[04:37.910 --> 04:39.390]  You did a hell of a job with this.
[04:39.390 --> 04:40.430]  This stuff tastes amazing.
[04:40.430 --> 04:42.670]  The only problem is that it is almost gone.
[04:42.670 --> 04:44.910]  I've probably got one or two dabs
[04:44.910 --> 04:46.510]  before this stuff is extinct.
[04:46.510 --> 04:51.670]  So bro, come back with a bigger jar and let's make a deal.
[04:51.670 --> 04:53.070]  All right, you guys, I'm obviously
[04:53.070 --> 04:55.430]  loving these cream dabs grown and extracted
[04:55.430 --> 04:56.350]  by a local farmer.
[04:56.470 --> 04:57.630]  Hey, bro, great work.
[04:57.630 --> 04:59.150]  I truly do appreciate it.
[04:59.150 --> 05:01.510]  In fact, this episode is going to be really long.
[05:01.510 --> 05:03.830]  So I've got all of the opening business covered.
[05:03.830 --> 05:04.870]  I'm going to press pause.
[05:04.870 --> 05:06.950]  I'm going to take a dab, probably the last two
[05:06.950 --> 05:08.110]  dabs of this cream.
[05:08.110 --> 05:11.190]  And when I get back, I will give a long lesson
[05:11.190 --> 05:13.750]  on drying and curing your freshly harvested cannabis
[05:13.750 --> 05:15.510]  plants.
[05:15.510 --> 05:17.190]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[05:17.190 --> 05:18.350]  I am well medicated.
[05:18.350 --> 05:19.430]  I am well hydrated.
[05:19.430 --> 05:21.750]  And I am ready to talk about drying and curing
[05:21.750 --> 05:25.470]  your freshly harvested cannabis plants.
[05:25.510 --> 05:27.670]  Now, let me do a quick update from the last episode.
[05:27.670 --> 05:30.510]  In the last episode, we talked about harvesting your plants.
[05:30.510 --> 05:31.910]  We talked about cutting them down.
[05:31.910 --> 05:34.070]  We talked about hanging them in a room upside down
[05:34.070 --> 05:35.590]  in a climate controlled room.
[05:35.590 --> 05:37.150]  One thing I failed to mention, you
[05:37.150 --> 05:40.510]  should only hang one crop in a space at a time
[05:40.510 --> 05:44.710]  to prevent re-moisturizing the first crop.
[05:44.710 --> 05:46.750]  Don't cut down one crop and then let
[05:46.750 --> 05:49.670]  it hang for four or five days, five or seven days,
[05:49.670 --> 05:52.630]  and then bring in a fresh crop and lock that in the same room.
[05:52.630 --> 05:54.430]  Because what you're doing is just introducing
[05:54.430 --> 05:56.350]  a whole bunch of moisture into that room,
[05:56.350 --> 05:58.310]  and it's just going to go into the other plants.
[05:58.310 --> 06:00.110]  You're going to re-moisten the other plants
[06:00.110 --> 06:01.390]  and make them take longer.
[06:01.390 --> 06:03.870]  And now you've got to kind of restart your dry and cure
[06:03.870 --> 06:04.550]  process.
[06:04.550 --> 06:08.910]  So one crop at a time is ideal hanging in the room.
[06:08.910 --> 06:11.630]  That's something I should have mentioned on the episode before,
[06:11.630 --> 06:13.230]  and I didn't remember to mention that.
[06:13.230 --> 06:15.230]  So now we are up to speed.
[06:15.230 --> 06:17.710]  Now, let's actually get into drying and curing
[06:17.710 --> 06:20.710]  our freshly harvested cannabis plants.
[06:20.710 --> 06:24.910]  Now, after spending four weeks in veg, eight to 10 weeks
[06:24.910 --> 06:28.150]  in flour, you really don't want to mess these plants up
[06:28.150 --> 06:29.510]  at the very end here.
[06:29.510 --> 06:31.430]  Curing is a very critical process.
[06:31.430 --> 06:34.950]  Curing, you can make the most delicious buds
[06:34.950 --> 06:37.990]  taste like total shit from drying and curing them
[06:37.990 --> 06:39.030]  improperly.
[06:39.030 --> 06:41.030]  You can ruin the entire crop at this point.
[06:41.030 --> 06:42.110]  Don't get too scared, because I'm
[06:42.110 --> 06:44.030]  going to guide you through not ruining it.
[06:44.030 --> 06:45.870]  But keep in mind that this is one
[06:45.870 --> 06:48.950]  of the most critical parts in the growing process.
[06:48.990 --> 06:51.270]  This is a huge process, and a lot of things
[06:51.270 --> 06:53.350]  can go wrong if you don't pay attention.
[06:53.350 --> 06:56.310]  So take your time and pay attention,
[06:56.310 --> 06:59.310]  and don't rush to smoke your new crop.
[06:59.310 --> 07:02.630]  You've waited, what do we say, about 14 weeks probably,
[07:02.630 --> 07:04.710]  is what we did the math on, 120 days.
[07:04.710 --> 07:06.710]  You've grown these plants for 120 days
[07:06.710 --> 07:08.510]  is about how long it takes.
[07:08.510 --> 07:10.790]  Why not wait a couple of days longer
[07:10.790 --> 07:13.230]  until they are perfect before you start smoking it?
[07:13.230 --> 07:16.830]  So let's get into actually drying and curing these plants.
[07:16.830 --> 07:19.070]  Now the last Grow episode was a Harvest episode,
[07:19.070 --> 07:21.150]  and it left us with our plants hanging upside down
[07:21.150 --> 07:23.950]  in a room with proper temps, proper humidity,
[07:23.950 --> 07:25.030]  and minimal light.
[07:25.030 --> 07:28.470]  Now we've been waiting for the sticks for our plants to snap.
[07:28.470 --> 07:30.230]  We've got plants hanging upside down.
[07:30.230 --> 07:31.150]  They've been de-leafed.
[07:31.150 --> 07:34.190]  We're just waiting for the right humidity within the plants
[07:34.190 --> 07:35.990]  for the sticks to pop.
[07:35.990 --> 07:37.470]  The sticks should snap.
[07:37.470 --> 07:39.470]  We're waiting for them to snap, but not explode.
[07:39.470 --> 07:42.550]  When you grab a branch of the plant and you just bend it,
[07:42.550 --> 07:44.990]  you want it to sound kind of like that.
[07:44.990 --> 07:46.750]  You don't want it to go, ksh.
[07:47.550 --> 07:48.390]  You don't want it to explode with dryness.
[07:48.390 --> 07:49.670]  You don't want it to fall apart,
[07:49.670 --> 07:53.190]  and you don't want it to be gummy or rubbery or bendy.
[07:53.190 --> 07:54.630]  You don't want it to bend.
[07:54.630 --> 07:56.550]  You want it to snap and pop.
[07:56.550 --> 07:58.630]  So the sticks should snap.
[07:58.630 --> 08:00.070]  The bigger sticks and larger plants
[08:00.070 --> 08:02.590]  are going to take a little bit longer.
[08:02.590 --> 08:04.270]  The skinnier sticks and smaller plants
[08:04.270 --> 08:05.930]  are obviously going to dry more quickly
[08:05.930 --> 08:07.950]  because they don't hold as much moisture.
[08:07.950 --> 08:11.510]  Also, if you took off less leaf or more leaf,
[08:11.510 --> 08:13.590]  they're going to dry more quickly without the leaf,
[08:13.590 --> 08:15.150]  and they're going to take a little longer
[08:15.150 --> 08:16.470]  with that extra leaf on there
[08:17.190 --> 08:18.630]  because it's going to hold more moisture.
[08:18.630 --> 08:20.350]  There'll be more moisture in the room,
[08:20.350 --> 08:22.150]  just more moisture overall to deal with.
[08:22.150 --> 08:25.770]  So what we're waiting for is those sticks to snap.
[08:25.770 --> 08:27.110]  When the sticks snap,
[08:27.110 --> 08:30.250]  that's when the container curing process begins.
[08:30.250 --> 08:33.550]  I use two different methods for this based on crop size.
[08:33.550 --> 08:35.870]  Don't forget that I run commercial grows.
[08:35.870 --> 08:36.830]  In a commercial setting,
[08:36.830 --> 08:38.030]  we do things a little differently
[08:38.030 --> 08:39.550]  than we would do in a home setting.
[08:39.550 --> 08:41.930]  I'm used to pulling down 50 or more pounds.
[08:41.930 --> 08:43.350]  In a commercial environment,
[08:43.350 --> 08:44.910]  you don't want a bunch of jars.
[08:44.910 --> 08:46.670]  You don't really have the space for a bunch of jars.
[08:46.670 --> 08:49.310]  You don't have the manpower to open a bunch of jars all day.
[08:49.310 --> 08:50.830]  So we do things a little differently.
[08:50.830 --> 08:54.470]  In a home grow, it's not as many pounds, it's less jars.
[08:54.470 --> 08:56.910]  So I use jar technique in a home grow.
[08:56.910 --> 08:58.670]  But let's talk about the way I would do it
[08:58.670 --> 08:59.790]  in a commercial grow.
[09:00.910 --> 09:02.190]  In a commercial grow,
[09:02.190 --> 09:05.190]  I'll chop the large stalk and naked stems out of the plants
[09:05.190 --> 09:07.430]  and place the buds still on sticks
[09:07.430 --> 09:09.910]  into large Rubbermaid containers.
[09:09.910 --> 09:11.230]  So you've got a big plant,
[09:11.230 --> 09:14.350]  you've lollipopped up probably 12 to 18 inches of it.
[09:14.390 --> 09:15.710]  So you've got some naked sticks, right?
[09:15.710 --> 09:16.990]  That's what I mean by naked sticks,
[09:16.990 --> 09:20.070]  the shaved legs and that main big stalk.
[09:20.070 --> 09:22.450]  I'll cut all of that out and that goes to waste.
[09:22.450 --> 09:23.290]  In a commercial grow,
[09:23.290 --> 09:24.830]  that's actually got to be weighed
[09:24.830 --> 09:28.030]  and documented as removed waste.
[09:28.030 --> 09:29.150]  So now I've got two piles.
[09:29.150 --> 09:32.430]  One pile is naked sticks that need to be documented as waste.
[09:32.430 --> 09:34.470]  They'll be chipped up and thrown away.
[09:34.470 --> 09:35.390]  Then there's another pile.
[09:35.390 --> 09:37.750]  That's the usable product of the sticks with buds up it,
[09:37.750 --> 09:39.170]  they need to be trimmed.
[09:39.170 --> 09:41.390]  Those buds still on the sticks
[09:41.390 --> 09:44.950]  get put into the Rubbermaid containers untrimmed.
[09:44.950 --> 09:46.590]  Now here's something to keep in mind,
[09:46.590 --> 09:48.910]  carefully label your Rubbermaid containers.
[09:48.910 --> 09:50.270]  Do not label the lids,
[09:50.270 --> 09:53.970]  never label lids in a facility, in a home grow,
[09:53.970 --> 09:55.070]  don't label the lids.
[09:55.070 --> 09:57.990]  Lids are interchangeable, label the container.
[09:57.990 --> 09:59.830]  So chop the sticks out,
[09:59.830 --> 10:02.690]  put the good usable buds into the Rubbermaid container.
[10:02.690 --> 10:04.070]  Don't squish them in there too tight.
[10:04.070 --> 10:05.230]  Fill it up pretty well,
[10:05.230 --> 10:06.730]  but don't cram anything in there.
[10:06.730 --> 10:07.910]  You need some airspace in there
[10:07.910 --> 10:09.190]  and you don't want to smash anything.
[10:09.190 --> 10:11.330]  And if it's too tightly pressed together,
[10:12.170 --> 10:13.530]  it'll get funky, it'll start to smell bad,
[10:13.530 --> 10:14.850]  moisture will get trapped in there
[10:14.850 --> 10:17.090]  and you'll start to get that stale ammonia smell
[10:17.090 --> 10:18.730]  and that's what we're trying to avoid
[10:18.730 --> 10:20.450]  with proper drying and curing.
[10:20.450 --> 10:23.130]  So I would go through and remove all of the sticks,
[10:23.130 --> 10:24.930]  get all the good buds into the containers
[10:24.930 --> 10:26.610]  and then once they are all completed,
[10:26.610 --> 10:27.890]  I would go through and put the lids
[10:27.890 --> 10:29.590]  on every container at that point.
[10:29.590 --> 10:31.010]  I would have everything labeled,
[10:31.010 --> 10:32.370]  it'd all be sitting open
[10:32.370 --> 10:34.550]  and then when we're done with every plant
[10:34.550 --> 10:35.990]  that's gonna get binned that day,
[10:35.990 --> 10:37.650]  that's when I start putting the lids on
[10:37.650 --> 10:39.390]  and sealing up the containers.
[10:39.390 --> 10:40.630]  Now I feel like I haven't described
[10:40.670 --> 10:41.990]  these containers properly.
[10:41.990 --> 10:44.290]  These Rubbermaid containers are like the size
[10:44.290 --> 10:46.050]  of maybe a laundry basket.
[10:47.030 --> 10:49.630]  They're about three feet wide I guess
[10:49.630 --> 10:54.090]  and then maybe a foot or so wide.
[10:54.090 --> 10:55.670]  I know I said wide, but three feet long
[10:55.670 --> 10:56.990]  and a foot or so wide
[10:56.990 --> 11:00.310]  and then probably about 18, maybe 20 inches deep.
[11:00.310 --> 11:03.070]  They're the one that you use for packing
[11:03.070 --> 11:04.470]  or you just put a bunch of clothes in there
[11:04.470 --> 11:05.510]  or just a bunch of bullshit
[11:05.510 --> 11:07.470]  or it's the one when the kids come to the front door
[11:07.470 --> 11:08.870]  and they're trying to sell candy for church.
[11:08.870 --> 11:10.350]  Like I got some candy for church there,
[11:11.070 --> 11:11.910]  would you like to raise some money?
[11:11.910 --> 11:13.190]  And they got the big Rubbermaid container,
[11:13.190 --> 11:15.270]  that's the container I'm talking about.
[11:15.270 --> 11:16.990]  It's just like a moving box or something
[11:16.990 --> 11:18.830]  is what it looks like, a storage container.
[11:18.830 --> 11:22.110]  We can fit three or four large plants
[11:22.110 --> 11:23.990]  in those containers from the commercial grow.
[11:23.990 --> 11:25.990]  So I guess I should have mentioned that a little earlier,
[11:25.990 --> 11:27.670]  but it just dawned on me that I did not describe
[11:27.670 --> 11:29.510]  these containers in any way.
[11:29.510 --> 11:31.110]  So now let's talk more about what happens
[11:31.110 --> 11:34.830]  to these plants once they are put into this container
[11:34.830 --> 11:36.790]  and the lid is put on them.
[11:36.790 --> 11:39.790]  They need to be opened and rotated every day
[11:39.790 --> 11:41.230]  until they're dry enough to seal up
[11:41.230 --> 11:43.070]  without risking any mold development.
[11:43.070 --> 11:45.470]  The first day is always scary when you seal them up
[11:45.470 --> 11:46.430]  and then leave overnight,
[11:46.430 --> 11:48.310]  that is always a scary feeling
[11:48.310 --> 11:50.550]  until you get there the next day.
[11:50.550 --> 11:52.450]  Don't be afraid to leave them open
[11:52.450 --> 11:54.110]  if you feel like they're a little too moist.
[11:54.110 --> 11:55.510]  If you cut them down and get them in the bin
[11:55.510 --> 11:58.470]  and realize, ah shit, a couple of these are too wet,
[11:58.470 --> 12:01.230]  don't be afraid to leave those open overnight.
[12:01.230 --> 12:02.390]  You would rather leave them open
[12:02.390 --> 12:03.950]  and get them a little too dry
[12:03.950 --> 12:06.190]  than close them up and get them a little funky.
[12:06.190 --> 12:07.950]  A little funky doesn't go away,
[12:07.950 --> 12:10.230]  a little too dry we can work with.
[12:10.230 --> 12:12.630]  So you seal them up, you put the lids on them
[12:12.630 --> 12:13.730]  and then you might wanna check on them
[12:13.730 --> 12:14.870]  before you leave for the day.
[12:14.870 --> 12:16.510]  Make sure that nothing needs to be rotated,
[12:16.510 --> 12:17.750]  nothing needs to be flipped around,
[12:17.750 --> 12:19.550]  nothing needs to be left open.
[12:19.550 --> 12:21.870]  Like I said, if it needs to be left open, leave it open,
[12:21.870 --> 12:23.150]  don't be afraid.
[12:23.150 --> 12:24.350]  Then you're gonna leave,
[12:24.350 --> 12:25.870]  you're gonna come back the next day,
[12:25.870 --> 12:27.470]  you're gonna have a bunch of sealed containers,
[12:27.470 --> 12:29.970]  they need to be popped open immediately.
[12:29.970 --> 12:32.830]  I would pop them open for four, maybe six,
[12:32.830 --> 12:35.230]  maybe seven hours and check on them.
[12:35.230 --> 12:36.310]  While they were sealed,
[12:36.310 --> 12:38.850]  a lot of the moisture that was inside those sticks
[12:38.850 --> 12:41.350]  reconstituted throughout those buds
[12:41.350 --> 12:43.310]  and a lot of moisture built up in that container.
[12:43.310 --> 12:45.270]  You're gonna find a lot of spongy and wet buds
[12:45.270 --> 12:47.870]  when you come in in the morning, that's expected.
[12:47.870 --> 12:49.430]  Don't worry, it'll be okay.
[12:49.430 --> 12:50.370]  You're gonna leave it open
[12:50.370 --> 12:53.190]  and get some of that shit out of there, that's the idea.
[12:53.190 --> 12:55.130]  You wanna open it up every day
[12:55.130 --> 12:56.230]  and let that stuff out of there.
[12:56.230 --> 12:57.790]  When they start getting dry again,
[12:57.790 --> 12:59.630]  some of the sticks might not even snap again.
[12:59.630 --> 13:02.470]  Some of them may have re-moistened where they don't snap.
[13:02.470 --> 13:04.990]  That means you may have gone just a little bit too early,
[13:04.990 --> 13:07.690]  but it's not bad because we can get that moisture out.
[13:07.690 --> 13:09.590]  You don't want it to get too dry.
[13:09.590 --> 13:11.010]  So you're gonna pop them open,
[13:11.010 --> 13:13.110]  you're gonna see how wet they are, leave them open.
[13:13.110 --> 13:14.790]  You may just wanna leave them open for an hour.
[13:14.790 --> 13:16.870]  If they're real dry, an hour is fine.
[13:16.870 --> 13:20.670]  Four to six hours is not uncommon on the first day.
[13:20.670 --> 13:22.470]  If you chop those plants down
[13:22.470 --> 13:25.150]  or if you bend those plants a little bit too early,
[13:25.150 --> 13:26.390]  they may be really wet
[13:26.390 --> 13:28.490]  and you may have to leave them open for four to six,
[13:28.490 --> 13:30.350]  maybe the whole shift of eight to 10 hours.
[13:30.350 --> 13:32.910]  They may have to stay open, that's not uncommon.
[13:32.910 --> 13:33.990]  Try not to cut them down
[13:33.990 --> 13:36.470]  and put them into the bins so early next time,
[13:36.470 --> 13:37.310]  but you'll be okay.
[13:37.310 --> 13:38.710]  This is something you're gonna have to dial in
[13:38.710 --> 13:41.070]  with your facility and with your technique.
[13:41.070 --> 13:44.150]  So the duration of burp time is going to decrease
[13:44.150 --> 13:46.390]  slowly as the buds dry.
[13:46.390 --> 13:49.950]  These bins are going to sit in a room ideally
[13:49.950 --> 13:53.630]  that is at 50% humidity and 70 degrees
[13:53.630 --> 13:55.550]  until you have time to trim them.
[13:55.550 --> 13:59.070]  I run a humidifier and a dehumidifier at the same time
[13:59.070 --> 14:01.390]  and they're both set at 50% humidity.
[14:01.390 --> 14:03.910]  So if that room gets to 55% humidity,
[14:03.910 --> 14:06.230]  that dehumidifier kicks on immediately.
[14:06.230 --> 14:10.590]  If it gets to 45%, the humidifier comes on immediately.
[14:10.590 --> 14:12.550]  I don't get out of that 10 degree range
[14:12.550 --> 14:14.650]  and it stays pretty close with both of those machines
[14:14.650 --> 14:15.750]  and they're fighting each other.
[14:15.750 --> 14:17.850]  They pretty much just stay on all the time.
[14:17.850 --> 14:21.010]  So I've got these buds, they are in containers,
[14:21.010 --> 14:22.470]  they have not been trimmed yet
[14:22.470 --> 14:25.650]  and they still need to be burped on a daily basis.
[14:25.650 --> 14:27.950]  The first thing the dry and cure manager
[14:27.950 --> 14:29.550]  or the trim team manager should do
[14:29.550 --> 14:32.470]  when they get to the grow is pop open these bins
[14:32.470 --> 14:34.990]  and see what type of situation you've got.
[14:34.990 --> 14:37.110]  They should be getting drier and more smokable
[14:37.110 --> 14:39.350]  and they should start smelling more like dank cannabis
[14:39.350 --> 14:40.330]  every day.
[14:40.330 --> 14:43.670]  That fresh green wet smell should be going away
[14:43.670 --> 14:46.190]  but you're going to have to pop them every day
[14:46.190 --> 14:49.090]  and pay attention to how long they need to be opened.
[14:49.090 --> 14:50.670]  Like I said, that first day,
[14:50.670 --> 14:52.590]  you're gonna get four to six hours.
[14:52.590 --> 14:54.690]  Maybe the second day, four to six hours.
[14:54.690 --> 14:56.370]  Maybe the third day, four hours.
[14:56.370 --> 14:58.430]  Maybe the fourth day, three hours.
[14:58.430 --> 14:59.870]  Then maybe you're just gonna have to pop them open
[14:59.870 --> 15:01.970]  for an hour every day and see what's going on
[15:01.970 --> 15:02.870]  and check it out.
[15:02.870 --> 15:06.190]  Eventually, you won't have to open them anymore.
[15:06.190 --> 15:08.870]  Once you've gotten them to about 65% humidity
[15:08.870 --> 15:10.910]  inside the container consistently,
[15:10.910 --> 15:12.030]  you don't have to burp it.
[15:12.030 --> 15:14.130]  That is cured where you want it.
[15:14.130 --> 15:16.830]  And it's also in that room with 50% humidity.
[15:16.830 --> 15:19.230]  So it's gonna stay about 50% humidity
[15:19.230 --> 15:20.830]  and it won't get less than that.
[15:20.830 --> 15:23.590]  And the containers hold moisture in there.
[15:23.590 --> 15:26.030]  So it's gonna stay above 50%, trust me.
[15:26.030 --> 15:28.590]  So while you're drying and curing inside those bins,
[15:28.590 --> 15:30.590]  be sure to burp the bins every day
[15:30.590 --> 15:33.950]  and rotate the buds to prevent mold and funky aromas
[15:33.950 --> 15:36.110]  until they get dry enough to leave alone.
[15:36.110 --> 15:37.750]  Don't be afraid to take the buds
[15:37.750 --> 15:39.990]  and pick them up right outside of the container
[15:39.990 --> 15:41.710]  and flip them over and set them back in.
[15:41.710 --> 15:44.670]  So all the buds that were on the bottom are now on the top.
[15:44.670 --> 15:46.630]  And do that, you can do that once or twice a day
[15:46.630 --> 15:49.830]  if you feel like you need to, if they are really wet.
[15:49.830 --> 15:51.110]  Now something I wanna keep stressing
[15:51.110 --> 15:52.710]  is if they are too moist,
[15:52.710 --> 15:55.110]  don't be afraid to leave the lid off the containers
[15:55.110 --> 15:57.030]  until the buds are nice and dry
[15:57.030 --> 15:59.030]  and you feel comfortable closing them up
[15:59.030 --> 16:01.310]  and you're sure there's not going to get any mold in there.
[16:01.310 --> 16:04.150]  Because if you leave it closed for too long
[16:04.150 --> 16:05.950]  or you bend these buds too early,
[16:05.950 --> 16:08.870]  you're going to create an ammonia type,
[16:08.870 --> 16:11.390]  funky, terrible smell inside your buds.
[16:11.390 --> 16:12.950]  They're not going to burn well,
[16:12.950 --> 16:14.550]  they're gonna taste terrible,
[16:14.550 --> 16:15.950]  they're gonna smell funky,
[16:15.950 --> 16:17.390]  and it's not gonna be desirable
[16:17.390 --> 16:19.550]  and you're not gonna be able to sell it at your dispensary
[16:19.550 --> 16:21.530]  or however you plan on selling it.
[16:21.530 --> 16:23.550]  So one problem you may run into
[16:23.550 --> 16:25.990]  if you leave it closed too long is funky aromas.
[16:25.990 --> 16:28.990]  The only thing you can do to fix that is try to air it out.
[16:28.990 --> 16:30.830]  Just leave it open, let it dry,
[16:30.830 --> 16:32.550]  try to let that smell go away,
[16:32.550 --> 16:34.170]  and it's probably not going to,
[16:34.170 --> 16:35.470]  you've probably gone too long.
[16:35.470 --> 16:38.510]  So make sure not to seal it up for too long
[16:38.510 --> 16:41.430]  and make sure not to seal it up when it's too moist.
[16:41.430 --> 16:42.750]  Another problem you could run into
[16:42.750 --> 16:44.310]  during the drying and curing process
[16:44.310 --> 16:46.870]  is the buds could get too dry.
[16:46.870 --> 16:49.350]  If your buds get too dry in those containers,
[16:49.350 --> 16:52.310]  a trick you can do is to go pull a few leaves
[16:52.310 --> 16:55.070]  from your growing plants.
[16:55.070 --> 16:56.370]  If you've got a flower room,
[16:56.370 --> 16:58.410]  you probably need to defoliate a little bit
[16:58.410 --> 17:01.430]  and pull some leaves off those flowering plants anyway.
[17:01.430 --> 17:05.190]  So go get, I would say four to six large leaves
[17:05.190 --> 17:07.910]  per Rubbermaid container is more than enough
[17:07.910 --> 17:11.990]  to rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one of those containers.
[17:11.990 --> 17:13.270]  We tried to put too much in there
[17:13.270 --> 17:15.590]  and it made it really wet really quickly.
[17:15.590 --> 17:18.870]  So four to six leaves is more than enough
[17:18.870 --> 17:21.190]  to remoisten an entire Rubbermaid container
[17:21.190 --> 17:23.910]  if you left it open just a little bit too long.
[17:23.910 --> 17:26.390]  If you got it down into that Colorado crunch zone,
[17:26.390 --> 17:27.230]  then you've done fucked up
[17:27.230 --> 17:28.590]  and you might not be able to fix it.
[17:28.590 --> 17:31.270]  But we'll talk about that a little bit later in the episode.
[17:31.270 --> 17:32.430]  But if you didn't go too far,
[17:32.430 --> 17:35.130]  just grab four or five, maybe six leaves,
[17:35.130 --> 17:37.530]  throw them in the container and seal it up
[17:37.530 --> 17:39.730]  for just a few hours, then go check on it.
[17:39.730 --> 17:41.790]  That moisture will reconstitute the buds
[17:41.790 --> 17:43.750]  and give you a second chance.
[17:43.750 --> 17:45.470]  I would not recommend using anything
[17:45.470 --> 17:48.430]  other than cannabis leaves, maybe Boveda packs,
[17:48.430 --> 17:50.370]  Boveda packs, however you like to say it.
[17:50.370 --> 17:54.250]  The Boveda packs commit 62% humidity.
[17:54.250 --> 17:55.530]  You can use those if you'd like,
[17:55.530 --> 17:57.890]  although I do not prefer them myself.
[17:57.890 --> 18:01.530]  I think they make a weird flavor in my cannabis buds.
[18:01.530 --> 18:04.090]  I think that using the leaves of the same plant
[18:04.090 --> 18:05.570]  is the best idea.
[18:05.570 --> 18:09.470]  All right, so that is basically the commercial grow version
[18:09.470 --> 18:12.710]  of drying and curing your cannabis plants on a large scale.
[18:13.790 --> 18:15.770]  Now I'm going to take a giant dab,
[18:15.770 --> 18:17.650]  and when we get back, we will talk about
[18:17.650 --> 18:19.490]  drying and curing your cannabis
[18:19.490 --> 18:22.090]  on a smaller scale for the home grower.
[18:22.090 --> 18:41.480]  All right, podcast, well, let's get back
[18:41.480 --> 18:44.080]  into this dry and cure episode.
[18:44.080 --> 18:46.400]  The home grow, or the connoisseur version
[18:46.400 --> 18:48.420]  of drying and curing your final product
[18:48.420 --> 18:50.840]  is a little bit different than the commercial grow version,
[18:50.840 --> 18:52.400]  but it's basically the same idea.
[18:52.400 --> 18:54.560]  We want to slow down the drying process.
[18:54.560 --> 18:57.240]  We want to get those buds to feel nice and sticky.
[18:57.240 --> 18:59.080]  We want them to smell nice and sweet.
[18:59.080 --> 19:00.480]  We want them to burn nice and smooth.
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.640]  So this is how I would dry and cure my product
[19:05.480 --> 19:07.360]  in a small connoisseur batch.
[19:07.360 --> 19:10.400]  In a smaller grow, a home grow or a boutique grow,
[19:10.400 --> 19:13.680]  or maybe something I was going to enter into a competition,
[19:13.680 --> 19:15.480]  if this was going into a cup,
[19:15.480 --> 19:18.300]  this is how I would cure my product.
[19:18.300 --> 19:20.560]  The main difference is that I would not be using
[19:20.560 --> 19:22.960]  the gigantic Rubbermaid containers.
[19:22.960 --> 19:27.080]  I would use quart size, wide mouth glass jars.
[19:27.080 --> 19:28.680]  I don't want to use bigger jars.
[19:28.680 --> 19:31.680]  I feel like maybe too much moisture gets stuck in there.
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.240]  You have the same conditions that you create
[19:33.240 --> 19:34.840]  in those Rubbermaid containers.
[19:34.840 --> 19:37.260]  I like the smaller, more focused jars.
[19:37.260 --> 19:39.080]  Another note before we get too far,
[19:39.080 --> 19:41.020]  make sure you label each jar.
[19:41.020 --> 19:42.920]  If you're working with more than one strain,
[19:42.920 --> 19:45.120]  label the jars, not the lids.
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.580]  Lids are interchangeable.
[19:46.580 --> 19:48.240]  Be careful with this, please.
[19:48.240 --> 19:50.120]  If you're working with different phenotypes,
[19:50.120 --> 19:53.800]  label the jar whatever arise phenotype two,
[19:53.800 --> 19:55.400]  arise phenotype three.
[19:55.400 --> 19:57.320]  If you're running a pack of seeds or whatever,
[19:57.320 --> 20:00.760]  label the jars so that you know what you're working with.
[20:00.760 --> 20:03.200]  Basically everything up to the point of the sticks,
[20:04.040 --> 20:05.080]  snapping is the same.
[20:05.080 --> 20:06.680]  We're waiting for the sticks to snap.
[20:06.680 --> 20:09.320]  Once the sticks snap, that's when we can start
[20:09.320 --> 20:11.300]  the jar curing process.
[20:12.240 --> 20:14.960]  For jar tech, I would take the snappy sticks
[20:14.960 --> 20:17.160]  and chop off every bud into a bucket.
[20:17.160 --> 20:19.040]  Just get all those buds off the sticks,
[20:19.040 --> 20:21.120]  into the bucket, throw those sticks away,
[20:21.120 --> 20:22.440]  get rid of them, do whatever you do with them,
[20:22.440 --> 20:25.520]  compost them, shred them up, toss them, those are done.
[20:25.520 --> 20:27.120]  Then I hand trim the buds.
[20:27.120 --> 20:29.740]  I'll do another episode all about hand trimming the buds.
[20:29.740 --> 20:33.040]  I don't like trim machines and I don't like wet trim,
[20:33.880 --> 20:35.240]  but I'll talk about that in the trimming episode
[20:35.240 --> 20:36.060]  that is coming up.
[20:36.060 --> 20:36.960]  So I trim the buds.
[20:36.960 --> 20:39.020]  They should be dry enough by now to knock off
[20:39.020 --> 20:42.000]  most of the leaves with your thumbs and thumbnails.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.220]  So trim them up pretty closely with your thumb,
[20:44.220 --> 20:47.320]  then put the trimmed buds into the glass jars
[20:47.320 --> 20:51.040]  that we talked about, the wide mouth quart size mason jars.
[20:51.040 --> 20:55.080]  Fill those jars about 75 to 90% full.
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.080]  If your buds are fluffier, if your buds are bigger,
[20:59.080 --> 21:01.360]  you're only gonna be able to get 75% in there
[21:01.360 --> 21:02.840]  because of all the air space.
[21:03.600 --> 21:04.440]  I get it, it makes sense.
[21:04.440 --> 21:07.560]  If you've got smaller buds, you can put up to 90% in there,
[21:07.560 --> 21:09.920]  but do not press them down into the jar
[21:09.920 --> 21:12.720]  and don't over pack them and don't squish them in.
[21:12.720 --> 21:15.520]  You just want them lightly sitting in there.
[21:15.520 --> 21:18.920]  Now once the jar is full, I add the lid and I set a timer.
[21:18.920 --> 21:21.660]  I like to check my buds about four hours
[21:21.660 --> 21:24.760]  after being sealed up for the first time.
[21:24.760 --> 21:26.860]  This first check lets me see how much moisture
[21:26.860 --> 21:28.200]  is trapped in my buds.
[21:28.200 --> 21:31.040]  If the inside of the jar is extremely humid,
[21:31.040 --> 21:33.360]  I'll just leave that lid off for an hour or more.
[21:33.360 --> 21:36.160]  In the commercial grow, we were talking about four to six,
[21:36.160 --> 21:38.640]  maybe eight hours, maybe even 10 hours.
[21:38.640 --> 21:42.200]  Those are much larger plants, much larger batches
[21:42.200 --> 21:43.800]  and much larger containers.
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.680]  There is much more moisture in there.
[21:45.680 --> 21:49.260]  So for these smaller jars, I only wanna leave it off
[21:49.260 --> 21:51.120]  for a little bit at a time.
[21:51.120 --> 21:54.000]  These smaller batches can get away from you quite quickly,
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  so pay more attention.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.340]  So open it up, see how humid it is.
[21:57.340 --> 21:59.520]  If it's really humid and really squishy,
[21:59.520 --> 22:01.480]  you're gonna wanna leave it open for an hour,
[22:01.480 --> 22:02.580]  maybe a little bit more.
[22:02.580 --> 22:04.840]  Just keep checking on it and do not forget about it.
[22:04.840 --> 22:06.400]  Set another timer.
[22:06.400 --> 22:09.600]  If the humidity has not made the buds squishy again,
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.180]  I'll leave the jar open for only like 15 to 30 minutes
[22:12.180 --> 22:15.280]  to let the moisture out and that old funky air
[22:15.280 --> 22:17.240]  out of the jar and then it'll kinda refresh
[22:17.240 --> 22:18.540]  with fresh air in there.
[22:18.540 --> 22:20.280]  Then I'll reseal the jar and let it sit
[22:20.280 --> 22:22.680]  for another four to six hours.
[22:22.680 --> 22:24.360]  I set a timer for this.
[22:24.360 --> 22:27.140]  Then in four to six hours, I pop that jar
[22:27.140 --> 22:28.920]  and I gently stir the buds around
[22:29.320 --> 22:31.800]  and check the aroma that comes out of there.
[22:31.800 --> 22:34.440]  What I'm looking for when I smell is an aroma
[22:34.440 --> 22:39.440]  of ammonia or funk or just you'll notice it.
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.400]  Your nose will crinkle up and your eyes
[22:41.400 --> 22:42.640]  will make a weird squint and you'll go,
[22:42.640 --> 22:44.160]  fuck, I fucked up.
[22:44.160 --> 22:45.600]  I'm looking for that aroma.
[22:45.600 --> 22:47.100]  I'm hoping that's not present.
[22:47.100 --> 22:48.380]  It shouldn't be.
[22:48.380 --> 22:51.640]  Also, I'm looking to see if it smells less wet.
[22:51.640 --> 22:54.900]  Has it gone from that wet, juicy hay smell
[22:54.900 --> 22:58.000]  to more of that cured, chronic smell that I'm looking for
[22:58.040 --> 22:59.500]  because it'll start doing it quickly
[22:59.500 --> 23:01.640]  and then it will improve over time.
[23:01.640 --> 23:03.140]  So I'm cracking the jar open.
[23:03.140 --> 23:05.600]  I'm looking to see how much humidity is in there.
[23:06.460 --> 23:07.840]  I stir them around.
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.320]  If the buds seem damp or extra spongy,
[23:10.320 --> 23:12.960]  at this point, I'll dump them out of the jar
[23:12.960 --> 23:14.960]  and let them sit for a few minutes
[23:14.960 --> 23:16.880]  until that excess moisture evaporates.
[23:16.880 --> 23:20.040]  You don't want the buds super soggy and sealed in a jar.
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.600]  You don't want the buds super wet
[23:21.600 --> 23:22.800]  and pressed together in a jar.
[23:22.800 --> 23:26.160]  If they still feel wet and spongy on the outside,
[23:26.160 --> 23:28.160]  I'll dump them out and let them sit out for a few minutes
[23:28.160 --> 23:30.460]  until they feel dry on the outside,
[23:30.460 --> 23:33.600]  but when you squeeze them, they're mushy still a little bit.
[23:33.600 --> 23:35.000]  You just want them dry on the outside,
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.680]  wet on the inside is what you're going for at this point.
[23:37.680 --> 23:39.720]  If the buds are sticking together,
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.440]  then I dump them out completely
[23:41.440 --> 23:44.000]  and let them dry more before putting them back in.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.060]  Now we want a little bit of moisture in these buds.
[23:47.060 --> 23:49.420]  The little bit of moisture is going to make
[23:49.420 --> 23:51.160]  the drying and curing process happen,
[23:51.160 --> 23:54.920]  but we don't want enough moisture to cause mold and funk.
[23:54.920 --> 23:57.320]  So we burp the jar about every four hours
[23:57.320 --> 23:59.300]  to make sure we don't seal too much water
[23:59.300 --> 24:01.200]  in the jar for too long.
[24:01.200 --> 24:02.940]  We let some of the curing process happen
[24:02.940 --> 24:05.480]  by opening the jar, letting that old gas out
[24:05.480 --> 24:07.980]  that contains the chlorophyll, that contains the sugars,
[24:07.980 --> 24:09.600]  that gas evaporates out of the jar.
[24:09.600 --> 24:12.220]  We replace it with fresh air, we seal it back up.
[24:12.220 --> 24:13.080]  Then when we seal it,
[24:13.080 --> 24:15.140]  it's allowed to restart the curing process.
[24:15.140 --> 24:17.580]  It'll start deteriorating and eating up
[24:17.580 --> 24:18.620]  more of that chlorophyll,
[24:18.620 --> 24:21.640]  more of those excess minerals and sugars inside of there,
[24:21.640 --> 24:24.280]  and they will start evaporating out of your buds.
[24:24.980 --> 24:27.520]  So let's get back on track here.
[24:27.520 --> 24:29.100]  After the first couple of days,
[24:29.100 --> 24:31.460]  you can slowly increase your burp intervals
[24:31.460 --> 24:33.380]  as the buds get drier.
[24:33.380 --> 24:35.440]  You may only need to open these jars up
[24:35.440 --> 24:37.620]  every six to eight hours after a little bit.
[24:37.620 --> 24:40.740]  And the time that you leave them open will also decrease.
[24:40.740 --> 24:44.020]  So maybe after a few days, you pop it open every eight hours.
[24:44.020 --> 24:45.800]  Maybe you pop it open right before you go to work,
[24:45.800 --> 24:47.320]  you leave it open while you're brushing your teeth
[24:47.320 --> 24:48.160]  and getting your shoes on,
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.620]  and then you close it up and you leave.
[24:49.620 --> 24:51.300]  You come back from work and then you pop it open.
[24:51.300 --> 24:53.020]  It's probably been 10 hours by now.
[24:53.020 --> 24:55.000]  Pop it open again, stir the buds around,
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.100]  make sure nothing's gone funky.
[24:56.100 --> 24:59.240]  If nothing's gone funky, just leave it open for five minutes.
[24:59.240 --> 25:02.220]  Let that air exchange in there, seal it right back up.
[25:02.220 --> 25:05.040]  Then you can go 10 hours and you know you're safe at 10 hours
[25:05.040 --> 25:07.600]  see what happens at 11 hours, see what happens at 12 hours.
[25:07.600 --> 25:09.720]  Just start stretching it every day.
[25:09.720 --> 25:11.040]  By the end of two weeks,
[25:11.040 --> 25:13.920]  you'll just be popping these jars open once a day.
[25:13.920 --> 25:15.360]  You'll check it out, you'll give it a good smell
[25:15.360 --> 25:17.000]  and you'll say, that is so close.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.640]  And then you can close it back up.
[25:18.640 --> 25:20.320]  By the end of two weeks,
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.060]  these buds will be beautifully, beautifully cured.
[25:24.060 --> 25:28.460]  So the bud should be sticky on the outside and spongy,
[25:28.460 --> 25:30.140]  but not dry and crumbly.
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.860]  They should almost have a little bit of squeeze,
[25:31.860 --> 25:34.500]  a little bit of give to them and then stick to your fingers.
[25:34.500 --> 25:37.260]  They shouldn't fall apart and just crumble up
[25:37.260 --> 25:40.820]  like a lot of the Colorado dispensary bud does, unfortunately.
[25:40.820 --> 25:42.180]  And the reason for that, you guys,
[25:42.180 --> 25:44.580]  is because it's sitting on the shelf out there all day.
[25:44.580 --> 25:47.460]  They're opening up those jars and showing it to you all day.
[25:47.460 --> 25:49.060]  That stuff is just getting dry.
[25:49.080 --> 25:51.040]  So that's the problem with the Colorado Crunch.
[25:51.040 --> 25:52.160]  I apologize for that.
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.480]  The growers work hard to get it proper.
[25:54.480 --> 25:56.960]  And then it's sent to the dispensary and left in those jars
[25:56.960 --> 25:59.000]  and the bud tenders don't do us justice.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.160]  So I apologize.
[26:00.160 --> 26:02.400]  So on day one, I chopped the buds off the sticks
[26:02.400 --> 26:03.460]  and I trim them up.
[26:03.460 --> 26:06.000]  Then I fill the jars about 90% full.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.360]  Then I seal the jar.
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.680]  I check the jar in about four hours.
[26:09.680 --> 26:11.640]  I open it long enough for the excess moisture
[26:11.640 --> 26:13.120]  to come out of the jar.
[26:13.120 --> 26:14.280]  That could be a little while.
[26:14.280 --> 26:16.440]  That could be a short amount of time.
[26:16.440 --> 26:18.360]  It kind of depends on how wet the buds were
[26:18.380 --> 26:19.780]  when you jarred them up.
[26:19.780 --> 26:21.580]  Then I check it again in about four hours.
[26:21.580 --> 26:24.480]  I shuffle the buds if I feel that's necessary.
[26:24.480 --> 26:26.700]  It's likely necessary.
[26:26.700 --> 26:28.460]  Then I check again in four to six hours
[26:28.460 --> 26:30.420]  and leave open as necessary.
[26:30.420 --> 26:33.040]  If they're getting too sticky again, I'll dump them out.
[26:33.040 --> 26:35.780]  You'll want to check as soon as you wake up the next day.
[26:35.780 --> 26:38.700]  The burp process will slow down over the next few days.
[26:38.700 --> 26:40.620]  You want it to take as long as possible
[26:40.620 --> 26:42.980]  without allowing mildew to develop.
[26:42.980 --> 26:44.140]  You want to slow it down.
[26:44.140 --> 26:45.460]  The longer it takes, the better.
[26:45.460 --> 26:48.400]  The more time that it takes for that moisture to come out,
[26:48.400 --> 26:51.880]  the more opportunity you have for chlorophyll to be removed.
[26:51.880 --> 26:53.400]  The only thing to worry about,
[26:53.400 --> 26:56.080]  very similarly to the Rubbermaid technique,
[26:56.080 --> 26:58.800]  is trapping too much moisture in your containers
[26:58.800 --> 27:02.500]  for too long and causing yourself mildew or funky flavors.
[27:03.440 --> 27:05.560]  If you locked your buds up in these jars long enough
[27:05.560 --> 27:08.520]  to where you got like white moldy webbing growing on there
[27:08.520 --> 27:09.800]  and it looks like some cotton coming out,
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.280]  you fucked up and didn't pay any attention,
[27:12.280 --> 27:13.480]  throw that away.
[27:13.480 --> 27:15.660]  If your jar is starting to get an ammonia smell,
[27:15.660 --> 27:17.160]  you've sealed it up too long
[27:17.160 --> 27:18.900]  and you've got to open it more frequently
[27:18.900 --> 27:20.320]  and longer next time.
[27:20.320 --> 27:22.260]  You may be able to save it, but it's unlikely.
[27:22.260 --> 27:23.800]  The only thing you can do is leave it open
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.220]  and let it dry out and hopefully that smell will go away.
[27:27.220 --> 27:29.940]  So don't leave it closed too long.
[27:29.940 --> 27:31.260]  Don't let mildew happen.
[27:31.260 --> 27:32.740]  Don't let that funky smell happen.
[27:32.740 --> 27:34.860]  Once you're past the first few days,
[27:34.860 --> 27:36.900]  you'll kind of be out of the mildew danger zone,
[27:36.900 --> 27:38.460]  but still be careful.
[27:38.460 --> 27:41.700]  Also keep your jars in a cool, dark place
[27:41.700 --> 27:43.340]  while you're curing your buds,
[27:44.200 --> 27:45.040]  but also don't leave them somewhere
[27:45.040 --> 27:47.160]  where you're going to forget about them.
[27:47.160 --> 27:50.840]  Also, here in Colorado, I'm running a swamp cooler
[27:50.840 --> 27:54.360]  in the main portion, the living area of my house.
[27:54.360 --> 27:57.200]  Don't go dump your buds on the table near the swamp cooler.
[27:57.200 --> 27:58.840]  This is not going to do you any good.
[27:58.840 --> 28:01.760]  This is going to reconstitute them and make them wetter.
[28:01.760 --> 28:03.960]  Think about, wetter, is that a word?
[28:03.960 --> 28:05.720]  Anyway, think about the environment
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.220]  where you were drying and curing your products.
[28:08.220 --> 28:09.720]  If you're gonna dump them out on the table
[28:09.720 --> 28:12.000]  in an attempt to get them more dry,
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.060]  make sure that the room is drier than the bud,
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.540]  or it's not going to work.
[28:16.540 --> 28:18.100]  Just keep that kind of stuff in mind, you guys.
[28:18.100 --> 28:20.900]  Think about your environment, think about your products.
[28:20.900 --> 28:23.260]  So I feel like we've got a basic understanding
[28:23.260 --> 28:24.980]  of how to cure our buds.
[28:24.980 --> 28:27.980]  Now let's get into the technical talk
[28:27.980 --> 28:31.500]  about why we do it and what's technically happening.
[28:31.500 --> 28:34.140]  So curing your buds properly makes your buds burn
[28:34.140 --> 28:36.280]  and smoke smoothly, and it also brings out
[28:36.280 --> 28:38.580]  the best flavors and aromas.
[28:38.580 --> 28:42.380]  Proper drying and curing will also increase your potency.
[28:42.380 --> 28:44.120]  Now why, why does that happen?
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.000]  Because your buds contain chlorophyll.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.320]  Chlorophyll is what gives your buds that harsh,
[28:49.320 --> 28:50.980]  smoke, and hay-like flavor,
[28:50.980 --> 28:53.200]  that burn-your-throat kind of funky flavor.
[28:53.200 --> 28:54.560]  That's from too much chlorophyll.
[28:54.560 --> 28:56.920]  That's from excess minerals in the plant.
[28:56.920 --> 28:59.080]  That could also be from an improper flush,
[28:59.080 --> 29:01.800]  but it's usually from an improper cure.
[29:01.800 --> 29:04.080]  So curing the buds will remove chlorophyll
[29:04.080 --> 29:06.740]  and increase your potency at the same time.
[29:06.740 --> 29:08.520]  The only way to remove chlorophyll
[29:08.520 --> 29:11.040]  is by turning it into a gas.
[29:11.040 --> 29:14.240]  Sealing our moist buds in a jar creates an environment
[29:14.240 --> 29:15.600]  that will break down the chlorophyll
[29:15.600 --> 29:17.380]  and turn it into a gas.
[29:17.380 --> 29:20.860]  Darkness, moisture, and oxygen will create
[29:20.860 --> 29:22.880]  a bacteria within the jar.
[29:22.880 --> 29:25.080]  That bacteria will break down the sugars
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.680]  and leftover minerals created by the decomposition
[29:27.680 --> 29:30.600]  of the chlorophyll, and it will turn into a vapor
[29:30.600 --> 29:33.040]  that can escape the jar when you pop it open.
[29:33.040 --> 29:34.520]  That was what I was talking about earlier
[29:34.520 --> 29:36.120]  when I said we pop open the jar
[29:36.120 --> 29:37.900]  and let the chemical reaction happen.
[29:37.900 --> 29:40.700]  Now this process is going to make your bud burn smoother.
[29:40.700 --> 29:42.600]  It's going to make it taste better.
[29:42.600 --> 29:45.360]  It's gonna bring out the proper aromas,
[29:45.360 --> 29:47.980]  the proper terpene profile that you're looking for,
[29:47.980 --> 29:51.100]  and it's also going to increase the overall potency
[29:51.100 --> 29:53.460]  of your finished product.
[29:53.460 --> 29:55.820]  Now if you really wanna nerd out and dial this in
[29:55.820 --> 29:57.940]  and create a connoisseur product,
[29:57.940 --> 30:00.540]  find yourself a hygrometer that fits
[30:00.540 --> 30:01.840]  inside of your mason jar.
[30:01.840 --> 30:03.580]  There are a couple available that fit
[30:03.580 --> 30:04.740]  right inside the mason jar.
[30:04.760 --> 30:06.200]  You can press it up to the front of the jar
[30:06.200 --> 30:09.240]  to where you can read the display without opening the jar.
[30:09.240 --> 30:12.120]  Find yourself hygrometers that will fit in the jar,
[30:13.200 --> 30:15.280]  and here are some suggestions on when to open
[30:15.280 --> 30:19.080]  and close your jars and how to dial them in perfectly.
[30:19.080 --> 30:23.640]  If your buds feel wet or if they are above 70% humidity,
[30:23.640 --> 30:25.800]  if the little display on that hygrometer
[30:25.800 --> 30:29.280]  inside of your jar reads above 70% humidity,
[30:29.280 --> 30:32.960]  you need to dump those buds out of the jar
[30:32.980 --> 30:37.740]  and let them dry until they get to 65 to 70% humidity.
[30:37.740 --> 30:39.900]  Now when you dump them out and you leave them somewhere
[30:39.900 --> 30:42.180]  that's not by the fan, that's not by the swamp cooler,
[30:42.180 --> 30:43.820]  that's not by the air conditioner,
[30:43.820 --> 30:46.060]  that's not by something that's going to drastically affect
[30:46.060 --> 30:49.060]  the rate of their drying, don't forget about them.
[30:49.060 --> 30:51.140]  Set a timer and go find them.
[30:51.140 --> 30:52.780]  Some of you are a little obsessive.
[30:52.780 --> 30:54.280]  You're definitely not gonna forget.
[30:54.280 --> 30:55.900]  Some of you are gonna take a couple of dabs
[30:55.900 --> 30:57.580]  and go play Fortnite and your buds
[30:57.580 --> 30:58.900]  are gonna dry up to shit.
[30:58.900 --> 31:00.380]  Don't let that happen, you guys.
[31:00.380 --> 31:03.040]  So if they are too humid, dump them out.
[31:03.040 --> 31:04.240]  Let them dry out a little bit.
[31:04.240 --> 31:07.260]  Get them down to 65 to 70% humidity.
[31:07.260 --> 31:09.440]  Now if your buds feel moist to the touch,
[31:09.440 --> 31:12.560]  if they're sticky and wet to the outside of the buds
[31:12.560 --> 31:15.800]  and the display reads 65 to 70% humidity,
[31:15.800 --> 31:19.180]  pop the lid off of that jar for 15 to 30 minutes
[31:19.180 --> 31:21.680]  and let a little moisture evaporate out.
[31:21.680 --> 31:24.680]  If you think they need longer than 15 to 30 minutes,
[31:24.680 --> 31:27.000]  let them go longer, but like I said,
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.400]  don't start playing Fortnite and start building shit
[31:29.420 --> 31:31.260]  and shooting people and forget about them
[31:31.260 --> 31:33.300]  because you don't want them to get too crunchy.
[31:33.300 --> 31:37.060]  So 15 to 30, maybe 45 minutes, maybe an hour,
[31:37.060 --> 31:39.380]  seal them back up, set yourself a timer
[31:39.380 --> 31:41.140]  to remember to check on them in a little bit,
[31:41.140 --> 31:43.320]  and now you can go play Fortnite and relax.
[31:43.320 --> 31:47.160]  Now, your goal is 60 to 65% humidity.
[31:47.160 --> 31:52.160]  You want that hygrometer to read between 60 and 65% humidity
[31:52.180 --> 31:54.600]  and you want them dry but not crunchy.
[31:54.600 --> 31:58.060]  They're gonna feel squishy and sticky, hopefully,
[31:58.080 --> 31:59.400]  but they're not wet.
[31:59.400 --> 32:02.120]  You just want them dry but not crunchy.
[32:02.120 --> 32:04.560]  You might need to let your buds sit out for a little bit
[32:04.560 --> 32:07.320]  before you roll a joint, if it's cured perfectly.
[32:07.320 --> 32:09.960]  The display will say 60 to 65%.
[32:09.960 --> 32:12.160]  You may need to take a couple of buds out of there
[32:12.160 --> 32:13.460]  and set them, I just set them right here
[32:13.460 --> 32:15.040]  on the front of my computer if I'm gonna roll one.
[32:15.040 --> 32:17.040]  It's a little warmer right there, just let them chill.
[32:17.040 --> 32:19.300]  They're not like in the path of the fan or anything.
[32:19.300 --> 32:20.140]  Just let them chill right here.
[32:20.140 --> 32:21.840]  That's what I'm gonna roll a joint within a few minutes
[32:21.840 --> 32:23.160]  and just let them sit there, you know,
[32:23.160 --> 32:24.440]  just for a little bit.
[32:24.440 --> 32:25.760]  Just maybe if I'm gonna go to lunch
[32:25.760 --> 32:26.880]  and come back and smoke a joint,
[32:26.900 --> 32:28.780]  I'll set them out right before I go to lunch.
[32:28.780 --> 32:30.140]  And then you go to lunch and then you come back
[32:30.140 --> 32:31.420]  and then they grind up nice and fine
[32:31.420 --> 32:34.340]  and they're still sticky, they're still juicy.
[32:34.340 --> 32:36.820]  And then your joint burns super smoothly.
[32:36.820 --> 32:39.020]  And if your joint's not burning super smooth,
[32:39.020 --> 32:41.660]  then you probably have too much moisture in there
[32:41.660 --> 32:44.840]  and you gotta let it dry and cure just a little bit longer.
[32:44.840 --> 32:47.340]  Now, if you hit that 55% or lower mark,
[32:47.340 --> 32:50.020]  you're entering what I call the Colorado Crunch area
[32:50.020 --> 32:51.660]  and your buds are gonna burn too fast
[32:51.660 --> 32:53.340]  and you're also losing weight.
[32:53.340 --> 32:55.460]  If you're working with more than a quarter pound there
[32:55.480 --> 32:57.880]  and you're drying it up, you risk losing, you know,
[32:57.880 --> 32:59.280]  a quarter of an ounce or whatever,
[32:59.280 --> 33:00.680]  depends on how much you let it dry.
[33:00.680 --> 33:03.120]  So if your buds get too dry,
[33:03.120 --> 33:06.160]  don't add anything funky to rehydrate them.
[33:06.160 --> 33:09.860]  The only thing I would use are fresh cannabis leaves
[33:09.860 --> 33:11.800]  and a little bit goes a long way.
[33:11.800 --> 33:13.640]  So take them out when the moisture comes back
[33:13.640 --> 33:16.160]  and don't let those leaves mold up in there
[33:16.160 --> 33:17.280]  and fuck up your crop.
[33:17.280 --> 33:19.000]  Check on them frequently.
[33:19.000 --> 33:22.820]  If you put wet leaves inside of either your curing jars
[33:22.820 --> 33:25.340]  or your packs or your fucking turkey bags,
[33:26.200 --> 33:28.200]  however you do it, make sure you take them out
[33:28.200 --> 33:29.960]  and don't leave them for too long.
[33:29.960 --> 33:31.640]  Check on them after an hour.
[33:31.640 --> 33:33.920]  One hour is more than enough.
[33:33.920 --> 33:35.040]  Go check on it.
[33:35.040 --> 33:36.120]  Set yourself a timer.
[33:36.120 --> 33:38.040]  Don't get stuck doing an Instagram live video
[33:38.040 --> 33:40.080]  and forget to check on your buds.
[33:40.080 --> 33:42.740]  All right, so it's gonna take a little bit
[33:42.740 --> 33:45.660]  for your hygrometer to measure the humidity in the jar,
[33:45.660 --> 33:47.760]  but it's gonna get you a pretty good idea
[33:47.760 --> 33:49.760]  of when to open and close those jars
[33:49.760 --> 33:52.840]  and it's gonna give you some actual data to go by.
[33:52.840 --> 33:54.600]  You'll be able to squeeze those buds
[33:54.660 --> 33:55.720]  and feel how wet they are
[33:55.720 --> 33:57.620]  and you'll be able to compare that number
[33:57.620 --> 33:59.620]  or that moisture to the number on the hygrometer
[33:59.620 --> 34:02.060]  and you'll go, oh, that's what 65% feels like.
[34:02.060 --> 34:04.020]  That's what Jeff's trying to get me to.
[34:04.020 --> 34:05.960]  So that gives you something to work with.
[34:05.960 --> 34:07.740]  It's a little bit of a cheater,
[34:07.740 --> 34:09.820]  but if you're using one hygrometer,
[34:09.820 --> 34:12.220]  you're gonna have to seal it into the jar for a few minutes
[34:12.220 --> 34:14.340]  and wait for it to get to where it needs to be.
[34:14.340 --> 34:16.100]  Now, if it's jumping real fast,
[34:16.100 --> 34:17.980]  go ahead and pull it out, leave that jar open.
[34:17.980 --> 34:19.340]  That means it's really humid in there
[34:19.340 --> 34:21.780]  and that you're just gonna seal it up and cause problems.
[34:21.780 --> 34:23.620]  All right, so we've got a little tiny hygrometer
[34:23.640 --> 34:24.800]  in our jars.
[34:24.800 --> 34:25.840]  We're watching the numbers.
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.840]  We're trying to get ourselves to 60 to 65% humidity
[34:29.840 --> 34:31.380]  inside of those jars.
[34:31.380 --> 34:33.080]  Make sure you don't forget about your buds.
[34:33.080 --> 34:35.040]  Make sure you don't get that funky aroma in there.
[34:35.040 --> 34:37.400]  Make sure it doesn't smell like ammonia and mildew.
[34:37.400 --> 34:38.960]  Make sure you don't ruin it.
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.560]  You should be paying attention to the number
[34:40.560 --> 34:42.600]  on the hygrometer and then pulling some buds out
[34:42.600 --> 34:44.700]  and seeing what they feel like so that you know
[34:44.700 --> 34:47.680]  what 50, what 60, what 70, what 80% humidity.
[34:47.680 --> 34:48.960]  If you get to 80, you fucked up.
[34:48.960 --> 34:51.160]  But so that you know what the percentage of humidity
[34:51.160 --> 34:53.640]  feels like inside these jars, what the bud feels like,
[34:53.640 --> 34:54.920]  this will give you a really good idea.
[34:54.920 --> 34:56.920]  Start paying attention to that stuff
[34:56.920 --> 35:00.520]  and you will get ahead of the drying and curing game.
[35:00.520 --> 35:02.480]  Now, once you've gotten your buds dried and cured
[35:02.480 --> 35:06.280]  to 55 to 65% humidity and you don't see any fluctuation
[35:06.280 --> 35:08.760]  inside that jar on the hygrometer,
[35:08.760 --> 35:11.000]  you only need to crack them open to check on them
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.400]  or pull out some buds to smoke.
[35:12.400 --> 35:14.560]  You don't need to keep popping those jars open.
[35:14.560 --> 35:15.960]  They're gonna get too dry if you do that.
[35:15.960 --> 35:17.560]  So you can trap the moisture in there,
[35:17.560 --> 35:19.140]  leave it right at that point,
[35:19.140 --> 35:21.100]  and your bud will be perfectly cured
[35:21.100 --> 35:22.060]  for whenever you need it.
[35:22.060 --> 35:24.620]  Now, I've said before that I don't like the Boveda packs,
[35:24.620 --> 35:26.500]  but they work if you do fuck up.
[35:26.500 --> 35:29.380]  The Boveda packs I would buy are the 62%
[35:29.380 --> 35:31.460]  and you can just drop them right inside your jar.
[35:31.460 --> 35:34.700]  It'll help reconstitute that package or that jar.
[35:34.700 --> 35:37.260]  And then sometimes I feel like they leave
[35:37.260 --> 35:38.780]  kind of a watery flavor on the buds,
[35:38.780 --> 35:40.940]  but I guess I'd rather have a properly cured bud
[35:40.940 --> 35:44.180]  that has that aroma than some Colorado crunch
[35:44.180 --> 35:47.060]  that's just gonna burn up when I light my joint at the show.
[35:47.060 --> 35:50.740]  So, ladies and gentlemen, that is my dry and cure episode.
[35:50.740 --> 35:52.000]  I wanna thank you guys for listening.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.460]  If you have questions, please send them to me.
[35:54.460 --> 35:58.000]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.780]  I would love to continue the conversation
[35:59.780 --> 36:02.540]  and clear up anything I left out for you.
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.820]  Just let me know.
[36:03.820 --> 36:05.260]  Also, this is a good time for me
[36:05.260 --> 36:07.860]  to recommend my Patreon campaign.
[36:07.860 --> 36:10.820]  Patreon is a website that gives you as a podcast listener
[36:10.820 --> 36:13.660]  the opportunity to contribute financially
[36:13.660 --> 36:15.420]  to my podcasting efforts.
[36:15.420 --> 36:17.700]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks,
[36:17.700 --> 36:18.980]  if you feel like you had some fun,
[36:18.980 --> 36:20.740]  if you feel like you learned something,
[36:20.740 --> 36:23.560]  I would encourage you to go to patreon.com
[36:23.560 --> 36:27.740]  slash growfromyourheart and sign up for my Patreon campaign.
[36:27.740 --> 36:30.260]  I know that not everybody is able
[36:30.260 --> 36:32.300]  to financially contribute to the show.
[36:32.300 --> 36:35.100]  I will always keep this show free for everybody.
[36:35.100 --> 36:37.140]  I want everybody to be able to hear my message.
[36:37.140 --> 36:40.140]  I want everybody to be able to improve their garden.
[36:40.140 --> 36:42.100]  I want everybody to have better medicine.
[36:42.100 --> 36:44.640]  I want better cannabis worldwide.
[36:44.680 --> 36:46.240]  I'm gonna do my part for free,
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.480]  but there are people who would like to contribute.
[36:48.480 --> 36:50.520]  There are people that feel like they can help out.
[36:50.520 --> 36:51.880]  I would appreciate that help.
[36:51.880 --> 36:54.600]  What I do with that funding is I pay for my website.
[36:54.600 --> 36:56.920]  I actually bought a MacBook,
[36:56.920 --> 36:58.480]  so I need to pay for the MacBook.
[36:58.480 --> 37:00.240]  I actually buy these little microphone covers
[37:00.240 --> 37:01.680]  so that when Granny and Giddy are on,
[37:01.680 --> 37:03.800]  they don't have to spit into these same microphone covers
[37:03.800 --> 37:05.340]  over and over again.
[37:05.340 --> 37:07.480]  So there are things like that that do need to be covered,
[37:07.480 --> 37:08.740]  and I do appreciate the support.
[37:08.740 --> 37:10.000]  You guys, I'm not begging.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.760]  If you don't know that it's an option,
[37:11.760 --> 37:13.240]  you don't know how you can help out.
[37:13.240 --> 37:15.600]  So I do appreciate everybody that has helped out
[37:15.600 --> 37:17.080]  with the Patreon campaign.
[37:17.080 --> 37:19.640]  It blows my mind every month to see that come in.
[37:19.640 --> 37:20.680]  Thank you.
[37:20.680 --> 37:22.880]  Also, you guys, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[37:22.880 --> 37:24.920]  Just thanks for putting your trust in me.
[37:24.920 --> 37:26.220]  Thanks for believing in me.
[37:26.220 --> 37:28.680]  You guys are risking your gardens on my advice,
[37:28.680 --> 37:31.520]  and that means a lot to me, so thank you.
[37:31.520 --> 37:33.440]  You guys, I am gonna start wrapping up this podcast.
[37:33.440 --> 37:35.740]  I wanna thank you again for listening to the show.
[37:35.740 --> 37:37.760]  Thanks for hanging out for the Drying Cure episode.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.380]  I hope you learned a lot.

[37:41.520 --> 37:43.520]  and then we're gonna talk about restarting the garden.
[37:43.520 --> 37:45.800]  I've got a bunch of great plans for the podcast.
