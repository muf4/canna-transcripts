[00:00.000 --> 00:02.200]  Welcome back, ladies and jelly spoons.
[00:02.200 --> 00:07.220]  We are gathered here today for episode 466 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.220 --> 00:10.900]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.900 --> 00:15.520]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:15.520 --> 00:23.480]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:23.480 --> 00:27.200]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:27.200 --> 00:32.560]  Today I've been taking dabs of Copper Chem full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[00:32.560 --> 00:35.040]  This is a cross of Chem 4 and Star Dog.
[00:35.040 --> 00:38.800]  On the label, the flavor is described as guava juice and watermelon.
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.560]  When I dab it, I get more of a gassy watermelon, gassy strawberry sort of a thing.
[00:43.560 --> 00:45.400]  It is still a delicious concentrate.
[00:45.400 --> 00:53.320]  The potency label says that this product contains 67.94% THC and zero CBD.
[00:53.320 --> 00:56.240]  I really enjoy and appreciate the Copper Chem.
[00:56.280 --> 00:59.920]  The flavor is perfect and the buzz is tremendous.
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.280]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the amazing Copper Chem full spectrum
[01:05.280 --> 01:06.280]  extract.
[01:06.280 --> 01:10.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, I'm
[01:10.920 --> 01:15.040]  going to read a couple of emails in this episode, but before we get there, let's do a couple
[01:15.040 --> 01:18.640]  of shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:18.640 --> 01:22.180]  Let's start off with a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
[01:22.180 --> 01:23.180]  our friend Melvin818.
[01:24.020 --> 01:27.140]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Meredith.
[01:27.140 --> 01:31.140]  Also a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to Ethan G.
[01:31.140 --> 01:36.500]  And of course, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast fist bump and a thank you to GregoryS.
[01:36.500 --> 01:39.940]  I want to thank everybody for all of the continued Patreon support.
[01:39.940 --> 01:46.740]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[01:46.740 --> 01:48.700]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:48.700 --> 01:53.140]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[01:54.100 --> 01:56.260]  All right, boys and girls, I did say that I was going to read some emails.
[01:56.260 --> 01:59.140]  This episode actually came to me from social media.
[01:59.140 --> 02:02.660]  I do not know that this person wants their identity revealed, so we're just going to
[02:02.660 --> 02:04.100]  jump right into this message.
[02:04.100 --> 02:05.700]  It goes like this.
[02:05.700 --> 02:10.220]  I just wanted to reach out and let you know that I really appreciate the info and insights
[02:10.220 --> 02:12.340]  that you provide on the podcast.
[02:12.340 --> 02:13.380]  That is a great way to start.
[02:13.380 --> 02:14.660]  You are very welcome.
[02:14.660 --> 02:15.820]  Thank you for the great compliments.
[02:15.820 --> 02:21.180]  It goes on to say, I just listened to episode 465 and you hit the nail on the head with
[02:21.180 --> 02:22.820]  the CHS topic.
[02:23.020 --> 02:27.140]  I got so many responses and so many emails on the CHS topic.
[02:27.140 --> 02:29.340]  I am going to do a recap and a revision on that soon.
[02:29.340 --> 02:33.660]  I will have to because my YouTube channel is just exploding with comments, but this
[02:33.660 --> 02:36.620]  is the first one that I printed before they all flooded in.
[02:36.620 --> 02:39.060]  This is the one we're going to focus on really quickly.
[02:39.060 --> 02:40.700]  It goes like this.
[02:40.700 --> 02:45.920]  I found out that without a patient diagnosis, our doctors cannot get paid from the insurance
[02:45.920 --> 02:48.500]  companies for your visit.
[02:48.500 --> 02:52.260]  What he's saying is when you go to the doctor and they examine you, if they can't write
[02:52.260 --> 02:56.200]  down a word of something that is wrong with you and have a title for it, they're not going
[02:56.200 --> 02:57.820]  to get paid.
[02:57.820 --> 03:03.020]  Because there is no test or even any studies to back the CHS theory, it is often used as
[03:03.020 --> 03:06.940]  an easy diagnosis that is hard to argue against as the patient.
[03:06.940 --> 03:08.660]  Yes, we're patients.
[03:08.660 --> 03:09.700]  Most of us are not doctors.
[03:09.700 --> 03:10.700]  We go to the doctor.
[03:10.700 --> 03:12.340]  They say, that's probably what you've got.
[03:12.340 --> 03:13.340]  They write it down.
[03:13.340 --> 03:14.700]  Now they can get paid.
[03:14.700 --> 03:17.860]  You've got a diagnosis and they can move on to the next patient.
[03:17.860 --> 03:22.780]  Unfortunately, many doctors are forced to see too many patients in too little time.
[03:22.780 --> 03:25.980]  I'm sure that it's not the doctor's goal and idea to do it that way.
[03:25.980 --> 03:27.860]  It is just a practice of business.
[03:27.860 --> 03:30.900]  That is how the hospital and how any sort of medical places run.
[03:30.900 --> 03:32.380]  It is now a business.
[03:32.380 --> 03:35.100]  You are a patient, but you are mainly a customer.
[03:35.100 --> 03:36.620]  You're absolutely correct.
[03:36.620 --> 03:37.780]  They do need a diagnosis.
[03:37.780 --> 03:39.180]  They need to get you out of there.
[03:39.180 --> 03:41.900]  It is very hard to argue that as a patient.
[03:41.900 --> 03:42.900]  There is more to this email.
[03:42.900 --> 03:47.540]  It says, I ended up finding out that I get migraines after two years of studies and tests
[03:47.580 --> 03:52.260]  with most doctors trying to blame my medical cannabis use as soon as I mentioned it.
[03:52.260 --> 03:57.820]  I am one of the very few people that suffer from migraines with nausea and vomiting issues.
[03:57.820 --> 04:00.300]  Then they wrap up the message by saying, sorry for the rant.
[04:00.300 --> 04:02.060]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug.
[04:02.060 --> 04:05.380]  Then they sign it with, great work as always.
[04:05.380 --> 04:06.700]  I appreciate the great compliments.
[04:06.700 --> 04:08.620]  I am for sure going to take a fat dab.
[04:08.620 --> 04:11.060]  I will give my mom a hug for you.
[04:11.060 --> 04:12.420]  Now let's touch on this a little bit.
[04:12.420 --> 04:17.300]  This person gets migraines and also gets nausea and vomiting.
[04:17.300 --> 04:21.820]  The doctors were immediately attributing it to his cannabis use or their cannabis use.
[04:21.820 --> 04:23.140]  They did not mention their gender.
[04:23.140 --> 04:25.260]  I should stop assigning genders to people.
[04:25.260 --> 04:27.140]  I could be wrong and that could be offensive.
[04:27.140 --> 04:32.420]  However, this person went to the doctor and they kept getting told that they have CHS.
[04:32.420 --> 04:37.740]  This person believes that since the doctor could not find a reasonable explanation for
[04:37.740 --> 04:41.900]  their symptoms, they simply wrote it off as CHS.
[04:41.900 --> 04:46.260]  That can be really dangerous and really frustrating because after more tests and more research
[04:46.260 --> 04:50.520]  and of course more money being spent, this person found out that they actually have migraines
[04:50.520 --> 04:52.500]  that cause nausea and vomiting.
[04:52.500 --> 04:58.660]  It probably does not have anything to do with CHS or cannabis hyperemesis syndrome.
[04:58.660 --> 05:03.040]  There's something that happens when anybody is trying to diagnose a problem or do some
[05:03.040 --> 05:08.220]  sort of investigation or maybe a repair and you're on a path and you're just thinking,
[05:08.220 --> 05:10.100]  what could the problem be?
[05:10.100 --> 05:11.940]  These doctors have very limited time.
[05:11.940 --> 05:15.820]  They need to focus on you for 10 or 12 minutes and get out of the room and get onto the next
[05:15.820 --> 05:18.620]  patient so they can just keep writing receipts.
[05:18.620 --> 05:19.780]  I should do a disclaimer.
[05:19.780 --> 05:23.580]  There are many great doctors who do great service.
[05:23.580 --> 05:27.900]  Unfortunately, many of the emergency room doctors, many of the affordable doctors are
[05:27.900 --> 05:32.780]  forced to work under less than desirable conditions, but they'd like to have a job.
[05:32.780 --> 05:36.020]  They've got to pay for medical school and they've got fucking needs.
[05:36.020 --> 05:39.660]  They need groceries and rent, so they're forced to work in whatever type of environment they
[05:39.720 --> 05:40.820]  can find employment in.
[05:40.820 --> 05:42.180]  So they do that.
[05:42.180 --> 05:43.220]  That is what they're doing.
[05:43.220 --> 05:44.720]  It probably isn't their choice.
[05:44.720 --> 05:46.240]  They're seeing too many patients a day.
[05:46.240 --> 05:49.020]  They're seeing patients for too short of a time.
[05:49.020 --> 05:52.500]  They've got a very short timeframe to come up with the diagnosis.
[05:52.500 --> 05:58.040]  And when you say, well, I also smoke cannabis, that little bell goes off, possibly CHS.
[05:58.040 --> 06:00.740]  They look at all the other things on the map and they go, yeah, nothing makes sense.
[06:00.740 --> 06:03.280]  I'm just going to write down CHS next.
[06:03.280 --> 06:05.860]  It's like all of the above on the test.
[06:05.860 --> 06:06.860]  It just works.
[06:06.860 --> 06:07.860]  It's an answer.
[06:07.860 --> 06:08.860]  You can get away with it, move forward.
[06:09.060 --> 06:13.900]  And in this case for the doctor, unfortunately, there is no repercussion.
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.020]  There's no circumstance.
[06:15.020 --> 06:16.660]  There's no consequence.
[06:16.660 --> 06:18.380]  You just write that down and move forward.
[06:18.380 --> 06:22.460]  Unfortunately, the patient has to deal with that for their life or until they do get it
[06:22.460 --> 06:23.460]  figured out.
[06:23.460 --> 06:28.460]  Now, fortunately, or I guess, unfortunately, either way, fortunately, this person was able
[06:28.460 --> 06:31.580]  to find a doctor that could figure out what really was wrong with them.
[06:31.580 --> 06:36.340]  And they have been diagnosed with nausea and vomiting associated with migraines.
[06:36.340 --> 06:40.340]  So until they found the right doctor, they were just going to be getting told the wrong
[06:40.340 --> 06:44.420]  diagnosis just to be blown off and just to get that insurance money.
[06:44.420 --> 06:47.300]  So that was a great message that came in right after the episode came out.
[06:47.300 --> 06:50.620]  So I wanted to grab that one, print it out and read that here on the show.
[06:50.620 --> 06:52.220]  Thank you for sharing your experience.
[06:52.220 --> 06:56.300]  I hope you have found something to alleviate the pain, the nausea and the vomiting from
[06:56.300 --> 06:57.460]  those migraines.
[06:57.460 --> 06:58.460]  Migraines are terrible.
[06:58.460 --> 07:00.740]  I have a traumatic brain injury for a little while.
[07:00.740 --> 07:05.340]  I was very light sensitive and very noise sensitive and very everything sensitive due
[07:05.340 --> 07:06.740]  to a brain injury.
[07:06.740 --> 07:08.900]  So I know what it is like to have a migraine.
[07:08.900 --> 07:12.460]  I understand those symptoms and I definitely hope you've got that under control.
[07:12.460 --> 07:17.020]  Hey, thank you for the great message and thank you for supporting my theory a little bit
[07:17.020 --> 07:21.780]  with the CHS that it is kind of just a label for lazy doctors to write down so they could
[07:21.780 --> 07:23.300]  say they found a diagnosis.
[07:23.300 --> 07:26.280]  All right, I spent more time on that one than I wanted to.
[07:26.280 --> 07:28.780]  So I'm going to quickly move to the next email.
[07:28.780 --> 07:30.660]  This one did directly come through the email.
[07:30.660 --> 07:35.220]  If anybody out there would like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[07:35.220 --> 07:37.980]  I would love to hear from you.
[07:37.980 --> 07:40.060]  I'm not sure if they want their name said on the show.
[07:40.060 --> 07:42.580]  I'm trying to scan really quickly to hear if they want their name.
[07:42.580 --> 07:44.860]  Oh, wait, you can use my name if you read this on the show.
[07:44.860 --> 07:50.420]  So big shout out to our friend, Brian B. Here is an email from Brian B. It goes a lot like
[07:50.420 --> 07:51.420]  this.
[07:51.420 --> 07:54.500]  Rasta Jeff, your podcast is awesome.
[07:54.500 --> 07:58.900]  Thank you so much for taking time to deliver such a high quality growing podcast.
[07:58.900 --> 08:00.940]  Man, I really like the way this is starting.
[08:00.940 --> 08:01.940]  Thank you, bro.
[08:01.940 --> 08:06.780]  I always look forward to listening to your podcast because the sound quality is superb
[08:06.780 --> 08:08.860]  and you have the perfect radio voice.
[08:08.860 --> 08:10.460]  Hey, that is a huge compliment.
[08:10.460 --> 08:15.260]  I do put a lot of effort into making sure that the sound of the show is top notch.
[08:15.260 --> 08:16.740]  I was kind of an audio nerd.
[08:16.740 --> 08:17.860]  I was a musician.
[08:17.860 --> 08:19.140]  I am a musician.
[08:19.140 --> 08:22.980]  I was into that way before I became a podcaster or got into podcasting.
[08:22.980 --> 08:26.020]  So I appreciate knowing and hearing that it sounds good.
[08:26.020 --> 08:29.180]  And then hearing that I have a radio voice really is embarrassing because I don't like
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.380]  my voice at all.
[08:30.380 --> 08:33.020]  It took me 50 episodes to get comfortable hearing myself.
[08:33.020 --> 08:35.780]  Now it is just normal, but I appreciate that because I don't like it.
[08:35.780 --> 08:37.380]  So I'm glad people do.
[08:37.380 --> 08:40.460]  And it is funny when people are like, you've got that smooth radio voice, especially when
[08:40.460 --> 08:41.460]  dudes say it.
[08:41.460 --> 08:42.660]  It's really awkward, but thank you.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.740]  I do appreciate that.
[08:43.740 --> 08:44.860]  We're going to keep moving.
[08:44.860 --> 08:46.580]  It goes like this.
[08:46.580 --> 08:51.500]  I've learned so much from your podcast and I have applied as much as I could to my second
[08:51.500 --> 08:52.580]  ever grow.
[08:52.580 --> 08:56.380]  I think the bud turned out really good with your help and your genetics.
[08:56.380 --> 08:57.900]  And he says I was growing rock steady.
[08:57.900 --> 08:59.980]  So I'm glad the rock steady worked well for you.
[08:59.980 --> 09:03.780]  That was a huge contributing factor to the quality of your outcome.
[09:03.780 --> 09:07.460]  It goes on to say, however, I wanted to ask you a question regarding curing because I
[09:07.460 --> 09:11.180]  have read many forums online with conflicting information.
[09:11.180 --> 09:13.820]  Then it says, PS, I know you don't recommend reading forums.
[09:13.820 --> 09:16.140]  I just wanted some quick info related to the issue.
[09:16.140 --> 09:18.060]  I will explain below.
[09:18.060 --> 09:19.460]  Now Brian is very accurate.
[09:19.460 --> 09:23.940]  Most of the time, I don't recommend getting your information from the online forums.
[09:23.940 --> 09:29.500]  There is a ton of bullshit and false information on the internet.
[09:30.020 --> 09:32.220]  But there is also a ton of quality information.
[09:32.220 --> 09:36.580]  If you are smart enough to sift through it, if you were smart enough to do some comparisons,
[09:36.580 --> 09:40.480]  if you can read five articles and say, this one sounds like shit, these two make sense.
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.500]  This is the one I should probably go with.
[09:42.500 --> 09:45.300]  And then just disregard one of them probably.
[09:45.300 --> 09:49.260]  You should be able to figure out which articles are bullshit and which makes some sense once
[09:49.260 --> 09:52.900]  you get a little bit of experience and you have a basic understanding.
[09:52.900 --> 09:57.580]  But until then, those forums can be really confusing and really misleading and they can
[09:57.700 --> 10:00.900]  cause you more problems than they can do you good.
[10:00.900 --> 10:06.340]  So quite often I say to avoid the forums unless you are able to sift through the bullshit
[10:06.340 --> 10:07.900]  on your own.
[10:07.900 --> 10:13.140]  Those forums that were feeding people bullshit are a big part of why I do this podcast.
[10:13.140 --> 10:17.380]  I just saw a group in Facebook where a person was telling somebody to harvest their plants
[10:17.380 --> 10:22.260]  based on the ripeness or the brownness of the hairs on their plants, the pistils.
[10:22.260 --> 10:25.060]  They were saying now that the pistils are brown, it is time to harvest.
[10:25.060 --> 10:26.460]  And we're not smoking pistils.
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.220]  The pistils don't have shit to do with it.
[10:28.220 --> 10:31.780]  We want ripe trichomes, so let's not pay any attention to the pistils.
[10:31.780 --> 10:32.780]  So you're right.
[10:32.780 --> 10:35.980]  Sometimes the forums and the internet can be bullshit, but also who's to say that I
[10:35.980 --> 10:37.100]  know what I'm talking about?
[10:37.100 --> 10:40.420]  I'm sure I've come on here and said at least three wrong things before.
[10:40.420 --> 10:41.420]  So who knows?
[10:41.420 --> 10:44.660]  We've just got to be very careful to filter out the information.
[10:44.660 --> 10:46.700]  Try to get your information from a qualified source.
[10:46.700 --> 10:48.340]  I would like to believe that is me.
[10:48.340 --> 10:53.180]  I'm going to continue with this email because this Copperchem from Green Dot Labs has got
[10:53.180 --> 10:54.380]  me rambling.
[10:54.380 --> 10:55.380]  Let's get back into it.
[10:55.380 --> 11:01.700]  It says, does the curing process stop at 54% when you were curing in jars?
[11:01.700 --> 11:07.780]  The bud that I grew started at 70% and he's talking about a 70% moisture content, humidity
[11:07.780 --> 11:08.780]  in the jars.
[11:08.780 --> 11:14.180]  And I was gradually trying to bring it down to 55% through burping, but it got away from
[11:14.180 --> 11:15.480]  me one day.
[11:15.480 --> 11:22.640]  And as a result, the humidity in the various jars ranged from 52 to 55% relative humidity.
[11:22.640 --> 11:24.700]  So he was burping the jar slowly.
[11:25.020 --> 11:28.940]  His intention was to start off at 70 and then you seal the jar.
[11:28.940 --> 11:32.180]  And while the jar is in there, the moisture kind of gathers into the jar.
[11:32.180 --> 11:34.360]  It comes out of the buds and it sweats out of the buds.
[11:34.360 --> 11:37.020]  The moisture in the air ends up in the jar.
[11:37.020 --> 11:39.560]  There's a process to that that we'll talk about in a moment.
[11:39.560 --> 11:43.560]  You open the jar, the moisture is able to release the jar.
[11:43.560 --> 11:45.180]  The air and the moisture come out of the jar.
[11:45.180 --> 11:47.500]  That will also bring out chlorophyll in that process.
[11:47.500 --> 11:51.820]  That chlorophyll has now been turned into a gas and it is releasing that from that jar.
[11:51.820 --> 11:53.380]  Then you seal the jar back up.
[11:53.380 --> 11:57.260]  Now there's a little less moisture in the jar because we've just let a portion of it
[11:57.260 --> 11:58.380]  out.
[11:58.380 --> 11:59.380]  We seal it up.
[11:59.380 --> 12:03.660]  Now we give the opportunity for more of that moisture within the bud to kind of escape.
[12:03.660 --> 12:07.340]  It sweats out of the bud and becomes atmospheric into the jar.
[12:07.340 --> 12:09.020]  We open the jar and it escapes.
[12:09.020 --> 12:14.300]  Along with that process, we're turning chlorophyll from a chlorophyll pigment into a gas.
[12:14.300 --> 12:16.140]  That is basically what is happening.
[12:16.140 --> 12:19.400]  That gas allows that chlorophyll to leave the plant.
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.980]  Then we open the jar, it leaves the jar.
[12:21.980 --> 12:23.260]  We're going to do that multiple times.
[12:24.140 --> 12:29.660]  Each time we want to reduce the humidity in that jar very little, one, three, maybe 5%
[12:29.660 --> 12:31.900]  so we can do it over a period of time.
[12:31.900 --> 12:35.680]  Now it sounds like Brian got carried away and maybe possibly left the jar open for too
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.700]  long or something went wrong.
[12:37.700 --> 12:43.260]  He has got some cannabis in the jars where the relative humidity are ranging from 52
[12:43.260 --> 12:44.940]  to 55%.
[12:44.940 --> 12:46.700]  Now we'll get back into the email.
[12:46.700 --> 12:52.300]  It says, I have since brought the bud back up to 58 to 59% relative humidity by using
[12:52.340 --> 12:53.340]  cannabis leaves.
[12:53.340 --> 12:56.900]  You guys, if you get your herb too dry, it is okay to pull a couple of leaves out of
[12:56.900 --> 13:01.020]  the garden and drop those right into your curing jar and seal it up.
[13:01.020 --> 13:05.700]  But be very careful because you will be amazed at how much moisture is in that bud or in
[13:05.700 --> 13:09.100]  that leaf and how quickly it goes into that bud.
[13:09.100 --> 13:11.460]  Just pay attention so you don't mold it up, please.
[13:11.460 --> 13:12.980]  It will happen very quickly.
[13:12.980 --> 13:18.020]  Check on that jar very often, very soon, more frequently than you think you need to.
[13:18.020 --> 13:22.000]  The reason I recommend to use a cannabis leaf is because it is the same brick level.
[13:22.700 --> 13:23.700]  It's the same plant.
[13:23.700 --> 13:24.700]  It's the same flavor.
[13:24.700 --> 13:28.080]  It's not going to make any funky aromas or flavors in your finished product.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.260]  It is the same thing.
[13:29.260 --> 13:32.360]  You're putting the same kind of plant in the same kind of plant.
[13:32.360 --> 13:34.680]  Many people will recommend other things.
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.480]  People will recommend fruit.
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.240]  People recommend maybe like a Q-tip with moisture on it.
[13:40.240 --> 13:43.640]  Many people will use a humidity pack from different brands.
[13:43.640 --> 13:45.240]  I don't recommend any of that.
[13:45.240 --> 13:48.760]  A cannabis leaf is probably free and probably available.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.680]  Let's use that and not fuck up the flavors and aromas of our product.
[13:52.680 --> 13:54.240]  Let's keep going.
[13:54.240 --> 13:55.560]  Brian has put leaves into the jar.
[13:55.560 --> 13:58.280]  He's got the humidity back up where he wants it.
[13:58.280 --> 13:59.480]  Here's where the question comes in.
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.960]  It says, I have read in many forums that the cure is over once the humidity drops below
[14:04.960 --> 14:09.720]  54% and you cannot reinitiate the curing process.
[14:09.720 --> 14:16.120]  You can re-moisturize the bud, obviously, but is the curing state entirely over once
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.840]  the relative humidity drops lower than 54%?
[14:20.840 --> 14:23.440]  That is a really good question.
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.280]  I am not able to give you a solid scientific answer.
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.920]  I am going to be completely honest and transparent that that is a science question that is a
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.200]  little bit past what I am qualified for.
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.040]  I can speak from experience and I can give you bro science.
[14:39.040 --> 14:40.320]  So here's what I know.
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.880]  When we are curing our plants, our goal is to seal the buds in a container and that will
[14:45.920 --> 14:48.840]  create a gas inside of that container.
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.400]  The light, the oxygen, and the moisture work together to create a gas.
[14:53.400 --> 15:00.120]  That gas will begin to eat the chlorophyll and turn that chlorophyll into a gas itself.
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.120]  Then once we open the jar like I talked about earlier, that gas is released from the jar.
[15:06.120 --> 15:12.840]  Now that will continue, like you said, until we get to about 54% relative humidity seems
[15:12.840 --> 15:14.360]  to be correct.
[15:14.480 --> 15:17.600]  Now this is the part where I lack scientific education.
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.680]  I in my experience have noticed that once I let the buds get past that dry point, the
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.800]  chlorophyll does not, it is not able to be removed any further once that amount of moisture
[15:28.800 --> 15:29.800]  is gone.
[15:29.800 --> 15:35.840]  I feel like that moisture is required to create the chemical reaction that creates the breakdown
[15:35.840 --> 15:40.800]  of the chlorophyll that allows it to become a gas to allow it to remove itself from the
[15:40.800 --> 15:43.840]  plant into the jar into the atmosphere.
[15:43.840 --> 15:49.240]  So once it gets too dry, you will not be able to remove more chlorophyll and more pigments
[15:49.240 --> 15:52.180]  in my experience and opinion.
[15:52.180 --> 15:54.640]  The buds may still taste a little grassy.
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.360]  They may have a little bit of harshness to them depending on how long you let them stay
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.360]  moist.
[16:00.360 --> 16:03.480]  If this took long enough, you may have gotten all of that chlorophyll out of there.
[16:03.480 --> 16:05.760]  You may have a nice sweet cure.
[16:05.760 --> 16:10.200]  I don't know the timeframe in which you let it slip once it got too low.
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.600]  It sounds like you did a good job, so you should have at least a decent product.
[16:14.600 --> 16:18.800]  Now there is another aspect of drying and curing to think about.
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.200]  First we want to cure to remove chlorophyll.
[16:22.200 --> 16:26.760]  That is that natural reaction that I was talking about a moment ago when we seal the product
[16:26.760 --> 16:30.800]  in a jar, the gases and the moisture all start working together.
[16:30.800 --> 16:33.280]  It creates an environment that breaks down the chlorophyll.
[16:33.280 --> 16:36.120]  It allows the chlorophyll to become a gas.
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.080]  That green pigment that doesn't taste good has now become air.
[16:40.080 --> 16:41.080]  It is in the air.
[16:41.080 --> 16:43.160]  When we open the jar, we let that out.
[16:43.160 --> 16:44.400]  Now you don't have to smoke it.
[16:44.400 --> 16:48.000]  It is floating around in the room in such minute particles we don't notice it, but we
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.160]  don't have to smoke it.
[16:49.160 --> 16:50.480]  That is the good part.
[16:50.480 --> 16:51.880]  That is part of our goal.
[16:51.880 --> 16:58.860]  The other part is trichome ripeness and trichome preservation and terpene preservation.
[16:58.860 --> 17:04.120]  Depending on other environmental factors and when the product was harvested, you may still
[17:04.120 --> 17:09.000]  be ripening your trichomes during that curing process also.
[17:09.120 --> 17:14.600]  Your main question was, is the curing state entirely over once the relative humidity has
[17:14.600 --> 17:17.240]  dropped lower than 54%?
[17:17.240 --> 17:21.960]  You may not be pulling the chlorophyll out, but you are still slow drying that bud.
[17:21.960 --> 17:23.580]  It is getting drier just naturally.
[17:23.580 --> 17:25.840]  It is losing a little bit of moisture content.
[17:25.840 --> 17:32.000]  It still may be breaking down and you are absolutely getting trichome ripeness and cannabinoid
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.160]  conversions are still happening.
[17:35.160 --> 17:37.560]  Something is happening inside of that jar still.
[17:37.560 --> 17:40.040]  I would take some buds out now and smoke them.
[17:40.040 --> 17:43.280]  I would leave some in there for a week and smoke those.
[17:43.280 --> 17:44.880]  Maybe just one, just a bowl, maybe a joint.
[17:44.880 --> 17:45.920]  I don't know how you consume.
[17:45.920 --> 17:47.320]  Maybe a vaporizer bucket.
[17:47.320 --> 17:50.800]  I don't know what you're putting in the vaporizer, but just consume.
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.760]  Have one sesh of a bowl today and then a bowl in a week and then a bowl in two weeks.
[17:55.760 --> 17:58.200]  Then if you can conserve it, a bowl in a month.
[17:58.200 --> 18:01.520]  Then if you're fucking crazy, a bowl in two months and try to compare.
[18:01.520 --> 18:03.260]  See what the differences are.
[18:03.260 --> 18:05.440]  Try to notice all the subtleties.
[18:05.440 --> 18:09.520]  Many people don't have the palate or don't care to develop the palate to taste all of
[18:09.520 --> 18:12.300]  the subtleties in a cannabis plant.
[18:12.300 --> 18:15.000]  Many people won't clean the pipe and even give it an effort.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.680]  It all tastes like weed to me.
[18:16.680 --> 18:17.960]  I am not one of those people.
[18:17.960 --> 18:22.280]  I can taste subtleties and many different flavors in cannabis.
[18:22.280 --> 18:23.880]  I like a nice clean pipe.
[18:23.880 --> 18:29.360]  I would appreciate smoking a bowl of the same herb that has been kind of dried and cured
[18:29.360 --> 18:32.720]  and then pretty dried and cured and then really dried and cured and then this one's been going
[18:32.720 --> 18:33.720]  for a while.
[18:33.720 --> 18:36.880]  I would appreciate hitting a bowl of all of those and being like, yeah, that one tastes
[18:36.880 --> 18:40.520]  pretty good and make some notes and then try to remember a week later and be like, oh man,
[18:40.520 --> 18:41.640]  that does taste better.
[18:41.640 --> 18:45.880]  I would write down like gassy, grapey, smooth, burns my throat.
[18:45.880 --> 18:48.640]  I would breathe some of it through my nose just to see what it feels like through the
[18:48.640 --> 18:49.640]  nose.
[18:49.640 --> 18:50.960]  I would just breathe different ways.
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.080]  They serve beer in different shaped beer glasses.
[18:54.080 --> 18:58.400]  If you buy certain kinds of beer, they serve it in different glasses at the bar because
[18:58.400 --> 19:02.520]  the air creates a different flavor for those beers.
[19:02.520 --> 19:06.560]  When you're smoking cannabis or concentrates, make your mouth in different funny shapes
[19:06.560 --> 19:09.920]  and blow the air around, blow the smoke around in different shapes in your mouth and you'll
[19:09.920 --> 19:12.560]  taste different flavors and aromas.
[19:12.560 --> 19:17.480]  Pack a bowl of weed and don't light it and just draw through the pipe and taste it dry.
[19:17.480 --> 19:18.480]  No flame.
[19:18.480 --> 19:19.960]  Just see what it tastes like.
[19:19.960 --> 19:22.960]  You'll get that fresh herb, grassy, dank flavor.
[19:22.960 --> 19:24.240]  Tastes pretty nice.
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.560]  Then light it up, breathe it in, get that smoke all in your lungs and then blow it out
[19:28.560 --> 19:30.000]  like you normally do.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.920]  Pay attention to the flavor going in.
[19:32.320 --> 19:34.160]  As soon as it goes in, stop breathing.
[19:34.160 --> 19:37.200]  Not for don't like die, hold it right there.
[19:37.200 --> 19:41.600]  When that air stops, your tongue will catch the flavor, then blow it out.
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.960]  You'll taste it going out also.
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.360]  So you got an in flavor, you got a stop flavor, you got an out flavor.
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.760]  It's going to taste like something as soon as it gets out.
[19:48.760 --> 19:51.520]  Then if you're patient, just wait, just let your tongue relax.
[19:51.520 --> 19:56.120]  A couple seconds later, you're going to get a bunch of different subtle flavors.
[19:56.120 --> 19:57.960]  Those are the flavors I really look for.
[19:57.960 --> 20:03.160]  Right after that, exhale and then relax your face.
[20:03.160 --> 20:07.400]  Then I'll breathe in through my nose and then out through my mouth and then maybe in through
[20:07.400 --> 20:08.400]  my mouth.
[20:08.400 --> 20:09.600]  I'm just getting different flavors.
[20:09.600 --> 20:12.400]  I'm activating different flavors, different parts of my tongue, different parts of my
[20:12.400 --> 20:14.160]  palate, different terps are working together.
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.360]  I am noticing many subtle different flavors that probably many people didn't take the
[20:18.360 --> 20:22.560]  time or didn't know they had the ability to even detect.
[20:22.560 --> 20:24.400]  That's a good way to hone your palate.
[20:24.400 --> 20:26.480]  That is something I would appreciate.
[20:26.480 --> 20:27.960]  I'm going to wrap back around the question.
[20:27.960 --> 20:32.000]  I just did get off on a weird rant about how to smoke and smell and taste correctly, but
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.160]  not all is lost.
[20:33.160 --> 20:35.160]  You can smoothen up the flavor of that smoke.
[20:35.160 --> 20:36.760]  You can increase the potency.
[20:36.760 --> 20:40.920]  There are still cannabinoid conversions and things are still happening inside of that
[20:40.920 --> 20:41.920]  jar.
[20:41.920 --> 20:44.480]  So the short answer is no, not all is lost.
[20:44.480 --> 20:46.360]  The process is not done.
[20:46.360 --> 20:47.720]  Pull some out, smoke it.
[20:47.720 --> 20:51.880]  Pull some out later, smoke it and take notes and then let me know how it goes.
[20:51.880 --> 20:55.240]  You wrap this one up to say, sorry for the lengthy email.
[20:55.240 --> 20:59.200]  I just wanted to make sure I showed you some love, but also give you enough details to
[20:59.200 --> 21:00.520]  answer my question.

[22:53.920 --> 22:57.400]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[23:30.180 --> 23:40.020]  Now he's gone.
[23:40.020 --> 23:49.390]  Now he's gone.
[23:49.390 --> 23:51.390]  But he's gone.
[23:53.270 --> 23:54.790]  He's gone.
[24:00.460 --> 24:03.900]  Like a steam locomotive.
[24:04.780 --> 24:07.220]  Rolling down the track.
[24:07.980 --> 24:10.100]  He's gone.
[24:10.100 --> 24:12.100]  He's gone.
[24:12.100 --> 24:14.620]  Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[24:16.900 --> 24:18.900]  He's gone.
[24:21.380 --> 24:26.700]  Nine mile skid.
[24:27.900 --> 24:30.380]  On a ten mile ride.
[24:32.100 --> 24:35.700]  Hot as a pestle but cool inside.
[24:43.030 --> 24:45.030]  Cat on a tin roof.
[24:46.510 --> 24:48.510]  Dogs in a pile.
[24:50.310 --> 24:53.950]  Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile.
[24:55.150 --> 25:02.260]  Now he's gone.
[25:07.650 --> 25:09.650]  Now he's gone.
[25:13.130 --> 25:15.130]  But he's gone.
[25:17.050 --> 25:19.050]  He's gone.
[25:24.170 --> 25:27.170]  Like a steam locomotive.
[25:28.370 --> 25:30.370]  Rolling down the track.
[25:31.370 --> 25:33.370]  He's gone.
[25:33.370 --> 25:35.370]  He's gone.
[25:35.370 --> 25:37.370]  Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[25:40.370 --> 25:42.370]  He's gone.
[25:44.370 --> 26:59.720]  Maybe off on some high cold mountain train.
[27:01.720 --> 27:07.590]  Life wasn't anything but nothing to beg.
[27:07.590 --> 27:10.590]  And more of the same.
[27:11.590 --> 27:14.590]  Same old rat in a train ditch.
[27:16.590 --> 27:18.590]  Caught on a limb.
[27:19.590 --> 27:22.590]  You know better but I know.
[27:22.590 --> 27:32.900]  Like I told you.
[27:33.900 --> 27:35.900]  What I said.
[27:37.900 --> 27:41.900]  Still your face right on your head.
[27:42.900 --> 27:51.080]  Now he's gone.
[27:56.040 --> 27:58.040]  Now he's gone.
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.660]  Gone, he's gone.
[28:04.660 --> 28:06.660]  He's gone.
[28:12.380 --> 28:15.380]  Like a steam locomotive.
[28:17.780 --> 28:19.780]  Down the track.
[28:19.780 --> 28:21.780]  He's gone.
[28:21.780 --> 28:23.780]  He's gone.
[28:23.780 --> 28:26.780]  Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[28:26.780 --> 28:30.310]  He's gone.
[28:31.310 --> 28:38.760]  Like a steam locomotive.
[28:39.760 --> 28:42.760]  Rolling down the track.
[28:42.760 --> 28:44.760]  He's gone.
[28:44.760 --> 28:46.760]  He's gone.
[28:46.760 --> 28:49.760]  Nothing's gonna bring him back.
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.760]  He's gone.
