[01:01.190 --> 01:05.450]  start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking
[01:05.450 --> 01:09.670]  dabs of honeysuckle live batter. This is a blend of lemon essence and Han Solo
[01:09.750 --> 01:13.910]  burger on the package. The flavor is described as honey, sweet lemons and
[01:13.910 --> 01:17.590]  floral. We have talked about this concentrate on the show before. I really
[01:17.590 --> 01:21.630]  love that sweet honey flavor and I love that touch of floral tropical flavor at
[01:21.630 --> 01:25.750]  the end. What I like the most is the nice chilled out buzz I get from the
[01:25.750 --> 01:29.230]  honeysuckle live batter. It gives me a little bit of tunnel vision. It puts on
[01:29.230 --> 01:33.270]  the blinders. It helps with my focus. Makes me chill out and that is perfect
[01:33.270 --> 01:39.510]  for podcast concentrate. So big shout out to the honeysuckle live batter. In
[01:39.510 --> 01:43.950]  this episode I'm going to read a few patreon messages but before we get there
[01:43.950 --> 01:48.030]  let's do some shout outs to a few members of the 710 club. Of course the
[01:48.030 --> 01:53.230]  710 club are the folks who support us on patreon. The $7.10 a month level or
[01:53.230 --> 01:57.870]  higher. So with no further ado let's give a big grow from your heart podcast. Thank

[03:19.710 --> 03:23.710]  into the show I want to mention one more thing. I encourage you and invite you to
[03:23.710 --> 03:28.350]  come check out the updated iRegenetics.com. The website is still under
[03:28.350 --> 03:31.950]  construction but a lot of people have been asking how to get the Golden Goat
[03:31.950 --> 03:36.790]  Orange Gasm and Lemon Jeffrey t-shirts. The easiest way to get them is to visit
[03:36.790 --> 03:42.350]  iRegenetics.com. Check out the website there is a store link at the top of the
[03:42.350 --> 03:46.070]  page. Click on that store link it will take you to the official iRegenetics
[03:46.070 --> 03:50.430]  store where you can get your t-shirts. It will make it nice and easy. Excuse our
[03:50.430 --> 03:54.470]  mess on the website. The website is under construction it will evolve very
[03:54.470 --> 03:58.670]  heavily over the next two or three weeks. Within the next four weeks that website
[03:58.670 --> 04:02.630]  should look stellar. I want to send a big thank you shout out to everybody who's
[04:02.630 --> 04:06.030]  been working on the website for me, who has been emailing me and calling me
[04:06.030 --> 04:09.310]  asking me for guidance and questions. Where do I put this? What do we put here?
[04:09.310 --> 04:14.510]  Thank you. Building a website is not my thing. That kind of work would drive me
[04:14.510 --> 04:18.870]  crazy so I appreciate you. Thank you for the help and for the hard work. I cannot
[04:18.870 --> 04:22.190]  wait to see the final product. The important part right now you guys is
[04:22.190 --> 04:26.630]  that the t-shirts are available on the iRegenetics website. Go to the
[04:26.630 --> 04:31.430]  iRegenetics.com website. Click on that store tab. Grab yourself some shirts. Show
[04:31.430 --> 04:35.670]  some support. Thank you and big thank you to everybody who has already grabbed a
[04:35.670 --> 04:40.710]  Golden Goat, a Lemon Jeffrey or an Orange Gasm t-shirt. I appreciate your support.
[04:40.710 --> 04:45.670]  There are more t-shirts and more designs coming very soon. I'm in works with a
[04:45.710 --> 04:49.670]  couple of printers to get things coming quickly. One design is being held up by
[04:49.670 --> 04:54.190]  myself because I cannot decide which color to print the design on. As soon as
[04:54.190 --> 04:57.670]  I get my shit together, make some final decisions, send a few more emails. There
[04:57.670 --> 05:02.750]  will be new designs coming for the website. Stay tuned and excuse the mess
[05:02.750 --> 05:08.230]  but please do check in often on iRegenetics.com. I think that is all of
[05:08.230 --> 05:12.270]  the business part of the show. Let's get into the fun part of the podcast. This is
[05:12.310 --> 05:18.790]  the portion of the show where we read messages from our Patreon viewers. Our
[05:18.790 --> 05:22.950]  first Patreon message today comes from our friend Big Huff and this one goes a
[05:22.950 --> 05:29.230]  lot like this. It says, hey what's up Rasta Jeff? So I've got two Golden Goat S1s,
[05:29.230 --> 05:33.390]  an Orange Gasm and a Stir Fry going. Sounds like a great mix. I'm not sure
[05:33.390 --> 05:37.230]  what Stir Fry is but the Orange Gasm and the Golden Goats will grow beautifully
[05:37.230 --> 05:42.190]  together. It goes on to say I have them in Tuper which is a cocoa perlite mix
[05:42.190 --> 05:46.710]  and I basically think it is heavy on the perlite side. I'm not completely sure
[05:46.710 --> 05:50.150]  what the mix in Tuper. I know it is a good quality product. I do approve of
[05:50.150 --> 05:54.670]  that one. The Tuper I buy doesn't have perlite in it so I'm not sure the ratio
[05:54.670 --> 05:59.390]  you've got but it is a good product so keep doing that. It says on the bag of
[05:59.390 --> 06:04.830]  Tuper it says to water one to six times per day. Now here's where the question
[06:04.830 --> 06:09.870]  comes in. It says so if I watered it only once a day it basically stays on a five
[06:09.990 --> 06:15.470]  in a one to five water tech weight. So I'm thinking maybe should I ignore their
[06:15.470 --> 06:20.070]  one to six times per day. Let's unpack something there. I did mention that if
[06:20.070 --> 06:23.830]  you're not a podcast listener, if you haven't been following for a while, maybe
[06:23.830 --> 06:28.230]  you don't know what I mean when I say one to five water tech. He said it stays
[06:28.230 --> 06:33.110]  at a five when he waters it and waters it multiple times a day. One through five
[06:33.110 --> 06:36.430]  water tech is a watering technique that we have developed in a commercial grow
[06:36.470 --> 06:40.710]  environment that allows me to train people very easily on when and how to
[06:40.710 --> 06:46.030]  water our plants. So our plants are in a pot. We've got this we're gonna go with
[06:46.030 --> 06:50.950]  the cocoa and perlite mix that Big Huff is using here. When we water that plant,
[06:50.950 --> 06:54.470]  completely saturate that plant, we want to water it, we want to get about 10 to
[06:54.470 --> 06:59.790]  20% runoff when we water that plant. When we're done watering that plant is at a
[06:59.790 --> 07:05.430]  what I'm going to call a level 5 for watering tech. That is as saturated as
[07:05.430 --> 07:09.270]  that plant can get. It can't hold any more water on a scale of one to five.
[07:09.270 --> 07:13.830]  That's a five. As it begins to dry, obviously it's gonna dry up a little bit.
[07:13.830 --> 07:18.230]  We're going to get to a four. Number four doesn't need water. Number four, you
[07:18.230 --> 07:21.350]  watered it a little bit ago and it is safe. You don't have to check on that
[07:21.350 --> 07:24.910]  plant for a couple of hours. It is cool. That's a number four. Number three is
[07:24.910 --> 07:28.790]  when you go, ooh we're going to need to water that plant in a little bit. It
[07:28.790 --> 07:31.950]  might be just about time to water it. We can wait a little bit and there won't be
[07:31.950 --> 07:36.070]  any problems. A level two in one to five water tech is when the plants are going,
[07:36.070 --> 07:40.230]  hey guys water me, please give me some water. Number one is when you walk in the
[07:40.230 --> 07:43.750]  plants are going, hey motherfucker you should have watered me two hours ago. So
[07:43.750 --> 07:47.670]  that is the basics of one to five water tech. The way we know one to five water
[07:47.670 --> 07:52.070]  tech, you pick up the pot. Get a pot and saturate it. Make it as wet and heavy as
[07:52.070 --> 07:56.630]  it gets. Pick it up. We know that that's how heavy that plant should be when it
[07:56.630 --> 08:00.750]  is fully fully watered. Get another pot and don't put any water in it. Fill it
[08:00.750 --> 08:03.830]  with your cocoa. Fill it with your perlite. Pick it up. That's a level one.
[08:03.830 --> 08:08.190]  If the plant gets to that one, it's dry. It's fucking dead. Know how light that is.
[08:08.190 --> 08:12.150]  Know how light a number five is. Then as you water the plants, pay attention to
[08:12.150 --> 08:15.550]  them. See how they're reacting and responding. Learn where four is. Learn
[08:15.550 --> 08:19.190]  where three is. Learn where number two is. You'll be able to tell by touching the
[08:19.190 --> 08:22.990]  plants, by looking at the pots, by picking them up. Mainly by looking at the color
[08:22.990 --> 08:26.710]  of the cocoa. You'll be able to look and you'll go, that pot right there is a five.
[08:26.870 --> 08:30.910]  That one's a four. That one's a three. Let's not water the fives at all. The
[08:30.910 --> 08:33.950]  fours are cool. Let's think about watering the threes and definitely give
[08:33.950 --> 08:38.310]  the twos some water. So that is the basics of one through five watering tech
[08:38.310 --> 08:42.350]  so that you know what our listener is referring to. Now on his package of cocoa,
[08:42.350 --> 08:47.750]  they recommended that he waters his plants up to six times per day. And he
[08:47.750 --> 08:51.670]  doesn't think that that is good advice. Depending on your pot size, you're
[08:51.670 --> 08:55.750]  probably accurate. That may not be good advice. I don't water six times a day. I'm
[08:56.110 --> 08:59.750]  lucky to get two waterings per day and that's as much as I need. But let's jump
[08:59.750 --> 09:03.510]  back into the email so I can give you accurate advice. Should I ignore their one
[09:03.510 --> 09:07.990]  to six times per day? Notice it says one to six times per day. They don't want you
[09:07.990 --> 09:11.430]  to do it six times, up to six times per day. And we'll talk about that in a
[09:11.430 --> 09:15.510]  moment. Then he says, today I'm going to try to skip a day and see what happens.
[09:15.510 --> 09:20.510]  It just seems strange to keep them soaked all the time. Yeah, you don't want
[09:20.510 --> 09:24.190]  them too soaked all the time. You want them about that level three. So you want
[09:24.190 --> 09:28.310]  to saturate them to a five, let them dry up to about a level three, maybe touch
[09:28.310 --> 09:33.270]  level two, then re saturate to a five. I don't know how long that's going to take.
[09:33.790 --> 09:37.830]  The reason they say up to six times per day is sometimes people are running
[09:37.830 --> 09:42.870]  large, large plants in very small containers. Since you're doing cocoa with
[09:42.870 --> 09:47.670]  perlite in there, this is essentially a hydroponic setup. I treat this the same
[09:47.670 --> 09:52.150]  as hydroponics. There is not living soil in here. There's not soil. The cocoa
[09:52.150 --> 09:57.030]  doesn't hang on to any nutrients. This is basically hydroponics in a pot. It
[09:57.030 --> 10:00.190]  looks a lot like cocoa or it looks a lot like a soil or soilless mix. But
[10:00.190 --> 10:04.710]  honestly, this is a hydroponic grow when we treat it this way. So if you're
[10:04.710 --> 10:09.070]  growing in a little tiny pot, like a one gallon pot or a six inch net pot may be
[10:09.070 --> 10:13.070]  ideal. That thing's going to dry out rapidly. If you've got a big fat plant
[10:13.230 --> 10:17.790]  and a lot of air moving around in the room, that pot may get six waterings a
[10:17.790 --> 10:22.790]  day. But I'm in three gallon pots. My plants get watered in the morning at 9
[10:22.790 --> 10:27.430]  a.m. They get flooded. Then sometimes before we leave, sometimes it's five
[10:27.430 --> 10:30.710]  o'clock, sometimes we wait till six o'clock. If the bigger plants really
[10:30.710 --> 10:35.630]  need it, they will get watered again. But I'm mostly watering once or twice in
[10:35.630 --> 10:39.550]  the summer with giant plants. Sometimes we may get a third watering indoors, but
[10:39.550 --> 10:44.270]  that's uncommon. That doesn't happen. I'm using a three gallon pot. They stay,
[10:44.350 --> 10:47.310]  they don't get past that three by the time we come in in the morning if we
[10:47.310 --> 10:51.950]  water them again before we leave. So it is not necessary to water six times per
[10:51.950 --> 10:55.310]  day. Don't follow the instructions on the bag. I keep saying follow the
[10:55.310 --> 10:59.910]  instructions that the plants are giving you. Monitors are cool. Books are cool.
[11:00.070 --> 11:04.190]  Advice is great. My word can be wrong sometimes. If the plants say, fuck you,
[11:04.190 --> 11:09.270]  Rasta Jeff is wrong. I would rather you water me 34 times a day. Do that. The
[11:09.270 --> 11:13.470]  plants are the boss. So I don't think you need to be watering up to six times a
[11:13.470 --> 11:16.750]  day. I think it sounds like you may need to be watering every other day,
[11:16.750 --> 11:20.990]  depending on the size of your pot, how long it stays saturated, how the plants
[11:20.990 --> 11:24.630]  are reacting. Pick it up. You know, one through five watering tech. Check on
[11:24.630 --> 11:29.190]  there. Let it get to a three. If you keep over watering, you can cause root rot.
[11:29.470 --> 11:33.070]  You'll get a little bit of green algae on the top of the cocoa there. Also, that
[11:33.070 --> 11:36.830]  will encourage fungus gnats to come around. So don't over water too heavily.
[11:36.830 --> 11:40.270]  You don't want to keep them soaked like that. You're absolutely correct that it
[11:40.270 --> 11:43.230]  does feel strange to keep them soaked. You don't want them swampy. You don't
[11:43.350 --> 11:47.630]  want them drowning. That's not what they prefer. Especially smaller plants. You'll
[11:47.630 --> 11:50.830]  drown the shit out of them that way. As they get bigger, you can water the fuck
[11:50.830 --> 11:55.110]  out of them. But when they're small like that, you do run the risk of drowning
[11:55.110 --> 11:58.230]  them. I'm trying to read your email while I'm talking. So let me focus on one.
[11:58.230 --> 12:02.150]  We'll get back to the email. It says, if I watered multiple times a day, do you not
[12:02.150 --> 12:05.670]  water to run off each time? I'm trying to keep it as well. Am I trying to keep it
[12:05.670 --> 12:10.110]  as wet as possible? No, don't keep it as wet as possible. Follow that one through
[12:10.110 --> 12:15.350]  five water tech. Let it fluctuate from like a one to a 2.9 and then water that
[12:15.350 --> 12:20.670]  shit again. Always water to run off when using cocoa. You don't need to do it six
[12:20.670 --> 12:25.310]  times a day. But when you do water, water with runoff because if you don't water
[12:25.310 --> 12:28.310]  with a little bit of runoff coming out of there, you will build up salt. You're
[12:28.310 --> 12:31.670]  just pouring the Kool-Aid in and the Kool-Aid powder stays somewhere in the
[12:31.670 --> 12:34.870]  middle and it doesn't stop. So the next time you water, you're just watering more
[12:34.870 --> 12:38.390]  Kool-Aid powder on top of more Kool-Aid powder. Rinse that shit all the way
[12:38.390 --> 12:41.790]  through. Rinse it all the way through. Saturate the soil. Get the excess out of
[12:41.790 --> 12:45.030]  the bottom. Just make sure to saturate that. We'll make sure that you don't get
[12:45.030 --> 12:49.310]  lockout problems. It'll keep the pH and the EC inside the rhizosphere nice and
[12:49.310 --> 12:53.670]  happy. So that is my advice to you. Follow one through five water tech. The bag
[12:53.670 --> 12:56.950]  doesn't know what kind of plants you're growing. Tupper doesn't know how big your
[12:56.950 --> 13:02.710]  pots are or your environment is. It says up to six times per day. So one is up to
[13:02.710 --> 13:07.910]  six. Zero is still up to six times per day. So let the plants be the boss. Use
[13:07.910 --> 13:11.550]  that one through five water tech that we've talked about and rely on that. And
[13:11.550 --> 13:15.070]  you sound like a smart enough person that I think you'll know when these
[13:15.070 --> 13:18.910]  plants need some water. Big shout out to our buddy Big Huff. I look forward to
[13:18.910 --> 13:24.750]  hearing an update on how you adjusted your watering system. Alright, I've got
[13:24.750 --> 13:27.430]  another message right here in front of me. This one comes from our friend Papa
[13:27.430 --> 13:30.750]  Wheely. We hear from Papa Wheely quite a bit. Good to hear from you, brother. I hope
[13:30.750 --> 13:34.470]  things are well. This one came in a little while ago. I probably should have
[13:34.470 --> 13:37.350]  gotten to this message quite a bit ago, but I just found this in the folder and
[13:37.710 --> 13:42.190]  it goes just like this. It says, hey Rasta Jeff, great work you've been putting out
[13:42.190 --> 13:47.110]  lately and seamless quality sound with adding Mike into recent episodes. Thank
[13:47.110 --> 13:50.310]  you. I love hearing that people appreciate Mike and that he still sounds
[13:50.310 --> 13:53.430]  good. I've been trying to keep Mike on the microphone. He's getting better at it
[13:53.430 --> 13:56.910]  and he will be back on the show very soon. For those of you who keep asking
[13:56.910 --> 14:00.950]  Mike, people are asking for you, bro. It's time to get you on the show again. It goes
[14:00.950 --> 14:05.790]  on to say, Rasta Jeff, I have a question for you. I recently had a whodunit in my
[14:05.790 --> 14:11.870]  grow room. I was holding on to a UK cheese male in my clone and seedling
[14:11.870 --> 14:16.710]  area, which is a big modified Rubbermaid tote in one of my bedroom closets.
[14:16.710 --> 14:21.510]  Alright, so our friend had a male in a makeshift grow space. It goes on to say, I
[14:21.510 --> 14:25.230]  wasn't aware that males threw pollen even if they haven't been switched to
[14:25.230 --> 14:29.430]  12-12. It sounds like our buddy's plant spit out some pollen a little bit early.
[14:29.430 --> 14:34.470]  Got a little excited and let it go too soon. It goes on and says, I originally
[14:34.470 --> 14:37.910]  thought that there was some light leak issue in my flower room and there was a
[14:37.910 --> 14:41.510]  little light leak getting in. I also believe that the male pollen could have
[14:41.510 --> 14:46.150]  traveled under two doors in my bedroom and made it to flower room, to a flower
[14:46.150 --> 14:51.350]  room about 30 feet away and pollinated five amnesia fems in there. So it sounds
[14:51.350 --> 14:55.470]  like our buddy had a male plant and now he's got seeds in the females, which he
[14:55.470 --> 14:59.070]  did not expect because they were far enough away. And also he didn't plan on
[14:59.070 --> 15:03.070]  that male skeeting that early. So it sounds like he's got questions. It says
[15:03.070 --> 15:08.030]  they were loaded with seeds. I probably got a hundred so far. That's not many
[15:08.030 --> 15:11.550]  seeds honestly. If they were loaded you'd have thousands. I don't know how big your
[15:11.550 --> 15:15.030]  plants are, but loaded. Your idea of loaded and my idea of loaded with seeds
[15:15.030 --> 15:18.230]  are probably different, but still a bummer either way that your crop is all
[15:18.230 --> 15:22.710]  seeded up. I said crop, excuse me for that one. I'll put the word crop real big
[15:22.710 --> 15:27.830]  across the screen, all funny again too. It goes on to say, about 30 feet away, my
[15:27.830 --> 15:32.350]  questions are as follows. Is it true that male plants can flower without changing
[15:32.350 --> 15:37.590]  their light cycle and enough to flower a whole, enough to pollinate a whole room?
[15:37.590 --> 15:42.070]  And my second question is, if you pollinate a self-feminized plant with
[15:42.070 --> 15:46.090]  male pollen, does that give you a higher ratio of female seeds? Alright, so we've
[15:46.090 --> 15:49.350]  got a couple of good questions in here that I can answer for you. Question number
[15:49.350 --> 15:53.390]  one, is it true that male plants can flower without changing the light cycle?
[15:53.390 --> 15:58.310]  Yes, that can be caused by several things. That plant may not be getting enough
[15:58.310 --> 16:02.110]  light. Sometimes if they don't get enough light, if they're getting shaded, if the
[16:02.110 --> 16:05.410]  photo period is too short, if they're not getting basically enough light, if the
[16:05.410 --> 16:10.910]  PPFD is not enough for that plant, it may go into flower. Also, if it has got a too
[16:10.910 --> 16:15.590]  small of a pot, if it is root bound, it may go into flower. Also, some plants just
[16:15.590 --> 16:19.430]  decide that they go into flower. I don't know where that male plant came from. You
[16:19.430 --> 16:23.670]  said it's a UK cheese. I don't know what it was bred to. Sometimes plants just
[16:23.670 --> 16:27.230]  decide to flower. So, it could have been a genetic trigger in that plant that said,
[16:27.230 --> 16:31.710]  hey, you're old enough, flower. It could have been an environmental factor. It
[16:31.710 --> 16:35.670]  could have been something such as too small of a pot or too little of a light.
[16:35.670 --> 16:40.350]  Those things definitely could have made that plant flower. And yes, absolutely
[16:40.350 --> 16:45.350]  enough to pollinate an entire room. It does not take much pollen at all to
[16:45.350 --> 16:49.230]  pollinate the entire room. That plant was in there pollinating all night long. The
[16:49.230 --> 16:53.050]  fans were blowing around. You probably carried some pollen on your clothes. Yeah,
[16:53.050 --> 16:58.150]  so that is very likely, very common. I'm going to blame that male. I'm gonna say
[16:58.150 --> 17:00.790]  it probably got root bound or didn't have enough light. Those are the most
[17:00.870 --> 17:05.550]  common factors to make a male plant flower too early. The second question is,
[17:05.550 --> 17:10.910]  if you pollinate a self-feminized plant, so if we take an S1 plant, a feminized
[17:10.910 --> 17:15.190]  plant, if you pollinate a female, feminized female plant with male pollen,
[17:15.190 --> 17:20.990]  does that give you a higher ratio of female seeds? No, it does not. In my
[17:20.990 --> 17:26.350]  understanding, in my belief, the pollen, the sex of the plant comes from the
[17:26.350 --> 17:30.390]  pollen. So, if that male plant is throwing off pollen, there is a chance that
[17:30.790 --> 17:34.830]  pollen is male or female. That's where your decision is going to come from and
[17:34.830 --> 17:39.510]  your offspring was that pollen. What makes me, what supports that theory to me
[17:39.510 --> 17:44.310]  is that I could make female seeds by manipulating female plants. The part I'm
[17:44.310 --> 17:48.910]  manipulating is the male plant. The part I'm manipulating is the pollen. So, I
[17:48.910 --> 17:53.830]  believe that by manipulating that plant that I can create all female pollen and
[17:53.830 --> 17:57.710]  not have any male chromosomes. I think I'm kind of, Mr. Soul gave me the idea
[17:57.710 --> 18:02.390]  that we are filtering out the male pollen when we make feminized seeds. So, I
[18:02.390 --> 18:07.190]  don't think that you will make more female plants that way. I think since
[18:07.190 --> 18:11.350]  you're using a male plant, that is the one going to throw out its 50-50 male,
[18:11.350 --> 18:16.550]  50-50 female chromosomes. I believe that that will not make a difference. I think
[18:16.550 --> 18:20.670]  you're gonna get still 50-50 offspring. That is my belief and I said my
[18:20.670 --> 18:24.430]  supporting evidence is because we can make feminized seeds. The pollen donor
[18:24.550 --> 18:28.830]  decides the sex, in my opinion, from what I've been reading lately. So, I don't
[18:28.830 --> 18:32.350]  think that's going to work the way that you're thinking it's gonna work. All
[18:32.350 --> 18:35.990]  right, let's see if there's any more to this. There is not more to this. I think I
[18:35.990 --> 18:40.590]  wrapped up everything. I hope my male to female comparison makes sense there. Why
[18:40.590 --> 18:44.150]  you're not going to get more female seeds, I believe that is decided by the
[18:44.150 --> 18:48.470]  pollen donor. The pollen is male or female. Then it lands in the plant and
[18:48.470 --> 18:52.870]  makes the seeds. Those have that outcome, that offspring, that decision is
[18:52.870 --> 18:56.670]  made there. I feel like I've covered this. They're probably stressed out,
[18:56.670 --> 18:59.790]  root-bound, or not getting enough light is why they flowered and pollinated your
[18:59.790 --> 19:03.790]  plants. They're not going to be a high number of females, but I do wish you
[19:03.790 --> 19:07.550]  the best of luck in there. Papa Willie, thank you for the great message. Thank
[19:07.550 --> 19:11.190]  you for all of the interaction. I look forward to an update. Have you grown any
[19:11.190 --> 19:14.590]  of those seeds? How are they? Were they worth it? Because you made a bunch of
[19:14.590 --> 19:18.190]  seeds. The next thing to do is grow those. You know I'm gonna say it, don't
[19:18.190 --> 19:21.750]  sell them. Don't give them away unless you give a solid disclaimer that those
[19:21.790 --> 19:25.150]  were accidental beans. Alright, I've got another message here in front of me.
[19:25.150 --> 19:29.790]  Let's jump right into this one. This one comes from, let's see, do they want their
[19:29.790 --> 19:33.590]  names said? They don't want their name said, I don't think. It goes a lot like
[19:33.590 --> 19:37.030]  this. It says, hey man, I love the show. Thank you. That's a great way to start a
[19:37.030 --> 19:40.910]  message. It says, I only discovered you about six months ago, but I've listened
[19:40.910 --> 19:45.670]  to a bunch now and I'm a big fan. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. It says,
[19:45.670 --> 19:51.070]  your lengthy grow lesson compilation on episodes 401 through 405 were incredibly
[19:51.110 --> 19:55.830]  informative and got me hooked. That is great. Thank you. If you guys haven't
[19:55.830 --> 20:01.710]  heard grow lessons, episodes 401 through 405, those are intense, very in-depth grow
[20:01.710 --> 20:05.750]  lessons. I took several lessons that I had done previously and compiled them in
[20:05.750 --> 20:09.630]  a very specific order to make it basically a starting to grow and
[20:09.630 --> 20:14.590]  finishing a grow 101. If you listen to those lessons, you can pick how to grow,
[20:14.590 --> 20:18.310]  where to grow, when to grow, why to grow, how to plant your seeds, how to cut your
[20:18.310 --> 20:22.870]  clones, all the way up to cutting them down and smoking them. Episodes 401 through
[20:22.870 --> 20:26.790]  405 will get you through everything. If you've just found the show, I encourage
[20:26.790 --> 20:30.950]  you to travel all the way back to 401 and give a listen there and share it with
[20:30.950 --> 20:33.710]  your new grower friends because they really need to hear a lot of that info.
[20:33.710 --> 20:39.110]  Our new friend became hooked after 401 through 405. Thank you. I'm glad that you
[20:39.110 --> 20:42.830]  are hooked. Thank you for hanging out. Man, you have listened to a lot of content.
[20:42.830 --> 20:45.870]  Thank you. Thanks for sticking around. Some of those old episodes are
[20:45.870 --> 20:49.870]  embarrassing, so I'm glad you made it through those with me. It goes on. It says,
[20:49.870 --> 20:54.510]  anyway, thank you for all of the great content. I do have a question. Here's the
[20:54.510 --> 20:58.910]  fun part. It says, I'm a hobbyist, small-time personal grower, and I have
[20:58.910 --> 21:03.670]  only ever used soil and bag seed. I've sorted through the dude and half dudes
[21:03.670 --> 21:07.510]  and had a good time doing it, but... So he means he's pulled out male plants and
[21:07.510 --> 21:12.590]  intersex plants. It says, but recently I found my way to an amount of feminized
[21:12.590 --> 21:17.070]  beans with classic genetics, so I'm obviously very psyched. Because of this, I
[21:17.070 --> 21:21.390]  decided to go full press on a deepwater culture run for these babies, and this is
[21:21.390 --> 21:25.790]  my first venture into hydroponics. All right, so our buddy has gotten some great
[21:25.790 --> 21:29.950]  seeds and they've decided to grow them hydroponically. This is where the
[21:29.950 --> 21:33.310]  questions come in. It says, I've gathered up my supplies, including a full
[21:33.310 --> 21:38.830]  assortment of advanced nutrients, nutrients and supplements, but you
[21:38.830 --> 21:42.190]  guys say advanced nutrients, nutrients and supplements without thinking you
[21:42.190 --> 21:45.670]  said something funny. It makes total sense, but say it. All right, it goes on.
[21:45.670 --> 21:49.990]  It says, but I've never dealt with any of them before. I've always run the simple
[21:49.990 --> 21:54.190]  Fox Farms trio in my soil, and that's what I'm doing now. Then he gives some
[21:54.190 --> 22:00.190]  info. It says, finally my question is, I have four girls which have just hit week
[22:00.190 --> 22:05.550]  four of flower, so I just now flushed them for the first time. The pH is always
[22:05.550 --> 22:10.110]  good, the bud growth is promising, and all of the leaves are left healthy. So nice.
[22:10.830 --> 22:15.870]  So, since I've just flushed, can I switch from the Fox Farms Tiger Bloom, Big Bloom
[22:15.870 --> 22:19.710]  to the advanced nutrients Scenty Bloom and all of the supplements and secondary
[22:19.710 --> 22:23.630]  elements mixed in the middle of this flower cycle? I've never used any
[22:23.630 --> 22:29.550]  nutrients other than the FF3. Your help is greatly appreciated. Then there's some
[22:29.550 --> 22:32.350]  more details included here. That's the part I skipped before talking about the
[22:32.350 --> 22:36.470]  grow, which we can look right over that part right now. There's other stuff to
[22:36.470 --> 22:40.310]  talk about. First off, why are you flushing weekly? I don't find it necessary
[22:40.310 --> 22:44.790]  to flush once a week unless you've made a mistake, unless you've overfed. Flushing
[22:44.790 --> 22:48.430]  once a week is more stressful, more detrimental than good, in my opinion, to
[22:48.430 --> 22:53.190]  your crop. I'm not a hydroponic grower, not a deepwater culture guy, but what
[22:53.190 --> 22:56.390]  I've noticed is when you feed the plants is when they grow. When you feed the
[22:56.390 --> 23:01.270]  plants is when they get bigger, beefier, badder, stronger, more trichomes. Why are
[23:01.270 --> 23:06.350]  you going to skip feeding times? That is a day, a whole time that those plants
[23:06.350 --> 23:11.190]  could have been eating. I would not flush them until the very end. I don't
[23:11.190 --> 23:15.230]  find flushing, unless you have fucked up, made a mistake, overfed, something is
[23:15.230 --> 23:19.710]  wrong, don't flush until the very end. That is my opinion. That's my feedback, my
[23:19.710 --> 23:22.590]  advice there. I don't know why you're flushing. It's extra work to do it in the
[23:22.590 --> 23:27.310]  middle. You got to empty the reservoir, refill it, re-pH it, let it run for
[23:27.310 --> 23:30.190]  however long you're doing it. Then I don't know if you dump it and then
[23:30.190 --> 23:33.070]  refill it or if you just add nutrients to that and top it off. I don't know how
[23:33.070 --> 23:36.510]  you do that. I'm not a hydro guy, honestly, but it's more work. You could
[23:36.510 --> 23:40.790]  just dump the res on Monday, refill it on Monday, and then have that fresh set for
[23:40.790 --> 23:44.030]  the week and not do the flush. That's what I would do. I'm not sure why you're
[23:44.030 --> 23:47.470]  flushing. If you guys are hydroponic experts out there, tell me why you flush
[23:47.470 --> 23:50.670]  once a week. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. This guy said he did the first
[23:50.670 --> 23:54.950]  flush a week for, I don't understand why that's necessary, but he says plants look
[23:54.950 --> 23:59.830]  good. pH is good, bud growth is promising, leaves are healthy. There's no problem.
[23:59.830 --> 24:03.590]  Why are you flushing, bro? I wouldn't do that. The main question is, can I switch
[24:03.750 --> 24:09.550]  from Fox Farms to Advanced Nutrients? I would switch during that flush phase. If
[24:09.550 --> 24:13.910]  you flushed them out, switch right after that, or you can just switch any day. If
[24:13.910 --> 24:17.030]  you were in the middle of the week, you can dump out that reservoir, you can
[24:17.030 --> 24:21.190]  refill it, and you can put in that new nutrient system. The main part of the
[24:21.190 --> 24:25.070]  question is, can I switch nutrients here at week four in the middle of this cycle?
[24:25.590 --> 24:29.430]  The main answer is yes, you can. There's no reason not to switch to a better
[24:29.430 --> 24:33.310]  product, a more advanced product, if you will. I know that Advanced does offer a
[24:33.310 --> 24:36.710]  lot of different bottles, so you can really dial in your mix really well. If
[24:36.710 --> 24:39.870]  you see something is off, you can add more of one thing instead of having four
[24:39.870 --> 24:43.230]  different nutrients or elements in one bottle. You can't add some of that one
[24:43.230 --> 24:45.990]  because they're all four in there. You're going to add more of the other things as
[24:45.990 --> 24:50.590]  well. Advanced Nutrients breaks it apart, so it's all individual. I used to use
[24:50.590 --> 24:54.150]  Advanced. It wasn't my favorite. I have moved on from there. But let's focus.
[24:54.350 --> 24:58.790]  Yes, you can switch in the middle of your grow. Most of the time, it looks like you
[24:58.790 --> 25:02.710]  deepwater culture guys probably dump out a reservoir one day of the week. You clean
[25:02.710 --> 25:06.910]  it out. It looks like you're flushing at that point, then refilling it, then adding
[25:06.910 --> 25:10.990]  nutrients. That is when I would do the switch. I would dump it out, refill it. If
[25:10.990 --> 25:14.230]  you're going to do the flush, if you insist on doing the flush, do that. This
[25:14.230 --> 25:19.030]  would be the best time for it. Then add those new nutrients. Pay really close
[25:19.030 --> 25:23.270]  attention to how those plants react. The problem won't be that you switched brands.
[25:23.270 --> 25:26.990]  The problem will be the unfamiliarity of the new brand. You're going to have to pay
[25:26.990 --> 25:32.230]  attention. Learn to watch for a nitrogen toxicity or a cow mag deficiency, or just
[25:32.230 --> 25:35.470]  know what you're looking at the plants and be prepared to adjust on the fly.
[25:35.630 --> 25:39.350]  Because Advanced Nutrients is a completely different game than playing with those
[25:39.350 --> 25:44.230]  three Fox Farm bottles. You can make the switch. Do it during one of those reservoir
[25:44.230 --> 25:48.230]  changes. Or if you insist on flushing, do it right after one of those flushes. That
[25:48.230 --> 25:52.710]  may be one of the times that I do recommend a flush, the times that I do find a flush
[25:52.710 --> 25:56.550]  to be useful. Otherwise, I wouldn't even do that. But this may be a good time for it.
[25:57.070 --> 26:00.830]  Do your flush if you choose. Fill your res back up. Put your nutrients in there at the
[26:00.830 --> 26:05.510]  recommended rate. Maybe go a little bit lighter than the recommended rate, depending on
[26:05.510 --> 26:09.590]  how much stuff you're going to use, depending on how good you are at watching the
[26:09.590 --> 26:14.750]  plants' reactions. Maybe go half strength, maybe go three quarters. You can always add
[26:14.750 --> 26:18.750]  more, but you can't undo nutrient burn. If you see them starting to get a little bit
[26:18.750 --> 26:22.950]  yellow, if they're reacting like they need stuff, we can give them more. But we cannot
[26:23.070 --> 26:26.830]  take nutrients out once it's already in there. You can dilute your mix, but by now
[26:26.830 --> 26:31.790]  you've already seen a burn or something. So yes, you can switch. Just pay good, close
[26:31.790 --> 26:36.390]  attention for the first couple of days after that. Pay close attention to how those
[26:36.390 --> 26:40.390]  plants respond. If they need stuff, give them stuff. If they've had too much, dilute
[26:40.390 --> 26:44.550]  your mix. Don't be afraid to put more water in your reservoir. Make the nutrient
[26:44.550 --> 26:49.590]  solution a little bit less rich. Dilute it. Bring down your PPMs just a little bit.
[26:49.790 --> 26:54.830]  Then adjust the pH again after that. So the next thing I would do, I am not going to
[26:54.830 --> 26:58.910]  completely dis advanced nutrients because that is not the type of show this is. I'm
[26:58.910 --> 27:04.030]  just going to say that I tried advanced nutrients several years ago, and I've tried
[27:04.030 --> 27:08.590]  several products since then, and I have never looked back. I was not happy with my
[27:08.590 --> 27:14.190]  results from advanced nutrients. I did get the things they advertised. They advertise
[27:14.470 --> 27:19.190]  30% bigger crops. When I used all of the stuff and I did it correctly and I pushed my
[27:19.190 --> 27:23.950]  grow and I was in there every day doing what needed to be done, I got those big fat 30%
[27:23.950 --> 27:30.670]  heavier crops. But what I did not get was a room with very expressive plants. And I'm
[27:30.670 --> 27:34.470]  not dissing the brand. I'm just saying this was my experience. When I use different
[27:34.470 --> 27:40.230]  nutrients, if I plant five different plants from clone that from five different plants
[27:40.230 --> 27:45.550]  from clone that I know have distinct traits, I can see those distinct traits if I use
[27:45.550 --> 27:49.750]  different nutrients. When I was using advanced nutrients, all five of those plants
[27:49.870 --> 27:55.430]  looked, smelled and tasted very similarly. They tasted like advanced nutrients. CalMag
[27:55.470 --> 28:00.110]  is what they all tasted like. So I'm not trying to diss the brand or your grow or your
[28:00.110 --> 28:04.430]  decisions. But I do encourage you to pay attention to the quality of your product. See
[28:04.430 --> 28:09.430]  if it's what you want. Is that 30% more weight what you want or is unique flavors and
[28:09.430 --> 28:13.630]  aromas what you're going after? Then think about what you want to do with your grow. In
[28:13.630 --> 28:17.950]  my grow, I wasn't excited with the advanced nutrients. I apologize to advanced if it
[28:17.950 --> 28:21.710]  feels like I just kicked you right in the dick. That was my personal experience. Great
[28:21.710 --> 28:25.990]  people, great products, not the product for my garden. Love you guys. Sorry for that one.
[28:26.190 --> 28:29.030]  All right, I want to thank our friend who did not include their name. I don't know if
[28:29.030 --> 28:32.630]  they want their name given out on the podcast. They got the info that they needed. Thank
[28:32.630 --> 28:36.910]  you for the great question. I do appreciate it. And if you've got any input or feedback
[28:36.910 --> 28:40.670]  on that flushing part in the middle of a hydroponic grow, I'd love to hear why you're
[28:40.670 --> 28:44.470]  doing that. I want to know what it's doing for you. My theory is if nothing's wrong,
[28:44.510 --> 28:48.950]  don't flush. No need for that. It's like you're on a good diet and then suddenly you
[28:48.950 --> 28:52.030]  just starve me for a day. That's going to piss me off more than it's going to do
[28:52.030 --> 28:57.550]  anything to me. So that is my feedback, my opinion, and my input there. Thank you guys.
