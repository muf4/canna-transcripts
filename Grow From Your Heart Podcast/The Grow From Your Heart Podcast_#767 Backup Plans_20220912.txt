[00:01.080 --> 00:23.690]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. This
[00:23.690 --> 00:30.010]  is episode 767 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. In this episode, I'm going to talk
[00:30.010 --> 00:34.410]  a little bit about having a backup plan. Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a

[02:21.010 --> 02:26.230]  I saw this weekend. I got to run into my buddy Nick dude, I got to see my good friend Erica,
[02:26.230 --> 02:30.590]  I got to hang out with my buddy Baker, I got to boogie down with my buddy Justin. And most
[02:30.590 --> 02:34.110]  importantly, I got to boogie down and have a great weekend with the lovely dread vibes
[02:34.110 --> 02:38.870]  also known as Zara also known as the queen of my world. I got to take her to see fish
[02:38.870 --> 02:43.750]  where we bumped into a bunch of great friends. We had a good time. My favorite band is fish.
[02:43.750 --> 02:47.830]  They did four nights at Dick's sporting goods. What is a sporting goods event center sport
[02:47.830 --> 02:53.090]  the gigantic soccer field in Denver, Colorado fish did four nights there. I was planning
[02:53.090 --> 02:57.150]  to go to all four I don't miss a fish show in Colorado if they come within a couple hundred
[02:57.150 --> 03:01.590]  miles I will be there. So I got tickets for all four nights. I asked Miss dread vibes
[03:01.590 --> 03:05.510]  also known as Zara if she would like to go with me for a night or two. And being not
[03:05.510 --> 03:09.470]  a fish fan at the time she said she wanted to go to the first night. I thought that was
[03:09.470 --> 03:13.310]  great but I am a fish fan and I know that you never miss a Sunday show. So I got her
[03:13.310 --> 03:18.130]  a ticket for the first night and the last night, which was Sunday. And after the first
[03:18.130 --> 03:21.790]  night she looked at me and she said, Hey, babe, can I come with you tomorrow? And of
[03:21.790 --> 03:25.190]  course I said yes, because there's nothing better than fish other than fish with your
[03:25.190 --> 03:28.950]  favorite person. So I took her to the second night on the second night. She said, Hey,
[03:28.950 --> 03:32.310]  babe, this was amazing. And I said, yes, I already got you a ticket for tomorrow. She
[03:32.310 --> 03:36.530]  ended up going to all four nights because she loved the band fish so much. I've tried
[03:36.530 --> 03:42.630]  to describe the vibe, the feeling of a fish show the entire event from pulling into the
[03:42.630 --> 03:47.050]  parking lot to getting into the show to seeing the band to getting out of the parking lot,
[03:47.050 --> 03:52.750]  the parking lot party, everything involved in fish is a big, fun, productive event. It's
[03:53.350 --> 03:56.670]  an event. That's all I can describe it as I've tried to explain it to several people
[03:56.670 --> 04:00.670]  and I've never gotten it right. When I took her there, she was blown away. She had such
[04:00.670 --> 04:04.950]  a great time. She smiled for the entire four days. She had a big smile on her face on day
[04:04.950 --> 04:10.190]  five, we were all sore and felt like we were dying, but it was a great fish adventure.
[04:10.190 --> 04:14.150]  Once again, big shout out to all the friends that I saw there. If I ran into you at the
[04:14.150 --> 04:20.310]  fish shows and I was goofy or short with you and just said hi and walked away or didn't
[04:20.310 --> 04:24.110]  seem like I was all there, you're correct. I wasn't fucking all there. I was having a
[04:24.110 --> 04:27.830]  good time. It was the weekend. I was a little bit checked out, still got nothing but love,
[04:27.830 --> 04:31.870]  nothing but respect for you. If you got some seeds, please do post pictures of those when
[04:31.870 --> 04:35.030]  you grow them. All right, let me make sure I covered all the notes and then we're going
[04:35.030 --> 04:40.110]  to jump into the main topic of this podcast. Yes, I got to take the beautiful dread vibes
[04:40.110 --> 04:44.590]  to see fish. We ran into our friends. Nick was there. Shout out to Nick dude. Shout out
[04:44.590 --> 04:48.510]  to a longtime friend, Erica. Big shout out to my buddy Baker. Baker's the fucking mayor
[04:48.510 --> 04:53.310]  of Denver. An awesome dude. Also got to see a longtime friend, an old friend, my buddy
[04:53.310 --> 04:57.990]  Justin who's a fellow drummer, fellow fish nerd from back in the Lawrence, Kansas days.
[04:57.990 --> 05:01.590]  It's good to run into all those folks. Plus several other people that I saw ran into.
[05:01.590 --> 05:06.030]  I wanted to make a note to say hi to those folks. Shout out. Looks like we covered all
[05:06.030 --> 05:10.150]  of the main business at the top of the show. Let's just jump right into the main topic
[05:10.150 --> 05:16.230]  of this podcast. I've been talking about it a lot. I recently had the COVID-19 virus.
[05:16.230 --> 05:20.910]  COVID fucked me up pretty bad. I was down for 10 or 11 days feeling really sick, then
[05:20.910 --> 05:25.350]  probably another solid week of not feeling well. Then another couple of days of feeling
[05:25.350 --> 05:30.710]  like, damn, I just can't shake this. My body felt ran down. My attention span was funky.
[05:30.710 --> 05:35.350]  My lungs were lacking oxygen. My voice sounded like shit. I was in rough shape for a little
[05:35.350 --> 05:40.830]  while. While I had COVID, I was basically face down either in bed or on a couch for
[05:40.830 --> 05:45.470]  about 11 days. I would get up to go pee. Then I would get back on the couch. I'd eat as
[05:45.470 --> 05:49.590]  much food as my body would allow me to have, which wasn't much. Then I would try to find
[05:49.590 --> 05:53.590]  the couch and the air conditioner. I was so hot that I thought I was going to die. Couldn't
[05:53.590 --> 05:58.990]  function. I got dizzy every time I stood up. That is gone now. What I wanted to talk about
[05:58.990 --> 06:03.150]  today is, do you have some sort of a backup plan? I don't want you to get COVID. I don't
[06:03.150 --> 06:07.390]  want you to get sick. I don't want anything bad to happen to you, but it is possible.
[06:07.390 --> 06:13.510]  I don't want those things to happen to me, but it did. I was very minimally able to work
[06:13.510 --> 06:17.110]  in my garden for the time that I was sick. There was a two-week period where it was just
[06:17.110 --> 06:20.390]  kind of like, fuck it. If the plants live, they live. If they die, they die. That was
[06:20.390 --> 06:23.910]  my attitude. I know a lot of you guys are probably cringing hearing that. That's how
[06:23.910 --> 06:29.710]  sick I was. I did not care if the plants that operate my business lived or died. I do care
[06:29.710 --> 06:33.630]  deeply about that, but I was so sick that it was like, go stand up and water those plants.
[06:33.630 --> 06:37.950]  I would stand up and I'd feel like I was spinning in circles and wanted to throw up and do backflips.
[06:37.950 --> 06:41.910]  I didn't want to do the backflips. My brain was doing backflips. I couldn't really take
[06:41.910 --> 06:45.810]  care of the garden. Now, my question is, do you have a backup plan? Is there somebody
[06:45.810 --> 06:51.110]  in your circle, your life, hopefully within your home, possibly maybe they can water or
[06:51.110 --> 06:55.990]  wherever your grow is, they can water your grow for you should you get sick, injured,
[06:55.990 --> 06:59.270]  have to go away for a couple of days. Maybe you get a job opportunity you got to take
[06:59.270 --> 07:03.390]  off. Maybe fish comes. You got to go for four or five days and be away. Do you have some
[07:03.390 --> 07:07.470]  sort of a backup plan? Is there somebody that can water those plants for you? Does that
[07:07.470 --> 07:12.430]  person know how to adjust and check pH? Do they know how to mix nutrients? Maybe now
[07:12.430 --> 07:17.510]  is a good time to think about who would I call if I do have to go out of town? Who would
[07:17.510 --> 07:22.430]  I call if I do get sick? Because I always preach, especially in illegal red state areas,
[07:22.430 --> 07:27.470]  I always preach, shut up. Don't tell anybody about your grow. But do you have one person
[07:27.470 --> 07:30.990]  that you can trust with your grow? Luckily, I've got a, I've been in this town for a long
[07:30.990 --> 07:35.190]  time. I have a lot of great friends, a lot of family. I've got one or two people I can
[07:35.190 --> 07:39.550]  heavily rely on to take care of a garden. If things do go completely wrong for me, I've
[07:39.550 --> 07:43.390]  got people I can give instructions to and I can help them out. Plus there's cameras
[07:43.390 --> 07:47.310]  in there so I can guide them by using the cameras and we have FaceTime now. But do you
[07:47.310 --> 07:51.510]  have somebody in your immediate area that can come help you if you are going to have
[07:51.510 --> 07:55.630]  a problem? It's got to be somebody that you trust, but also somebody that you know is
[07:55.630 --> 07:59.790]  going to follow the instructions, but also somebody that when they mess it up, you know
[07:59.790 --> 08:02.750]  how you're going to be able to handle being mad at them. Cause you might be super pissed
[08:02.750 --> 08:07.470]  if this person accidentally ruins your garden. So do you have a backup for sick days? Do
[08:07.470 --> 08:11.470]  you have an auto watering system? Do you have somebody that can come in and water for you?
[08:11.470 --> 08:15.470]  If you do have that auto water system, it's going to need to be refilled eventually. Those
[08:15.470 --> 08:20.230]  shouldn't go for more than a week, maybe 14 days at the most. Uh, to the best of my knowledge,
[08:20.230 --> 08:24.230]  if you're, if you got water sitting in a reservoir, you don't want that there for too long, especially
[08:24.230 --> 08:27.670]  if it's got nutrients in it, even if it's moving still, in my opinion, you're going
[08:27.670 --> 08:32.230]  to want that changed out. Eventually does that person know how to change that water
[08:32.230 --> 08:37.630]  for you? How to replenish, reflow, fret replenish and or, and or I'm going to not even edit
[08:37.630 --> 08:41.950]  that. Look, I'm human. You guys, does that person know how to replenish and or refill
[08:41.950 --> 08:46.110]  your reservoir? That was harder to say than it looked. Jeez. All right, let me get myself
[08:46.110 --> 08:51.430]  back on track. Uh, also do you have somebody, I don't want you to get hurt. I don't want
[08:51.430 --> 08:54.830]  you to get sick, but shit does happen. This is the reality. Do you have somebody that
[08:54.830 --> 09:00.630]  you can call if you are to get hurt in your grow, especially in an illegal place, or maybe
[09:00.750 --> 09:04.710]  you don't want anybody. Maybe you just don't need paramedics and cops there. Maybe you're
[09:04.710 --> 09:08.390]  working in the garden. You poke yourself in the eye. Maybe you get something in the eye.
[09:08.390 --> 09:12.150]  Maybe you cut your finger and you just need some help. Do you have somebody that you can
[09:12.150 --> 09:16.190]  call? Do you have a way that you can do that? Maybe if you get some shit in your eyes, this
[09:16.190 --> 09:20.690]  has really happened to somebody that I know. He told me the story. He got pH down in his
[09:20.690 --> 09:25.590]  eyes while mixing a reservoir. He was blind. He could not see a fucking thing. He was in
[09:25.590 --> 09:29.670]  an illegal area, allegedly growing illegally. Allegedly it's all a fictional character.
[09:29.670 --> 09:33.390]  You can't do anything about a guy. You don't know who he is anyway. This dude had pH down
[09:33.390 --> 09:37.390]  in his eyes and could not figure out how to work his phone because he was blind. Luckily,
[09:37.390 --> 09:41.230]  he was able to hold the phone up and say, Hey Siri. Then he was able to call one of
[09:41.230 --> 09:44.670]  his family members who lived nearby, who was able to come and help him. I just activated
[09:44.670 --> 09:48.910]  Siri on my phone. I was afraid that would happen, but he used the Hey Siri feature.
[09:48.910 --> 09:52.110]  Then he called a family member. They came and helped him out. Do you have something
[09:52.110 --> 09:56.230]  like that set up? Is there somebody that knows about your grow that if you call and you say,
[09:56.550 --> 10:00.030]  I need some help, you can say it discreetly over the phone and they know what you're talking
[10:00.030 --> 10:04.450]  about. They can come help you out. That may be beneficial to you if you are in some sort
[10:04.450 --> 10:08.830]  of a prohibition area. Have somebody that can back you up all the time, even if you
[10:08.830 --> 10:14.990]  are not in a prohibition area because shit does go wrong. Now, speaking of having backups,
[10:14.990 --> 10:20.870]  I recently experienced a power outage. The transformer near where my grow was located
[10:20.870 --> 10:26.310]  exploded. It seriously fucking exploded. There was no power for about 18 hours. Do
[10:26.310 --> 10:30.830]  you have a backup plan for no power? Do you have a generator? Do you have some sort of
[10:30.830 --> 10:34.830]  idea of how to get out of the grow if the lights go dark? Because I've been in the grow
[10:34.830 --> 10:38.350]  and the power goes out and it's completely dark in there. If I didn't have my cell phone
[10:38.350 --> 10:41.570]  or most of the time I carry a little pocket flashlight these days, if I didn't have one
[10:41.570 --> 10:44.910]  of those devices, I would have been shit out of luck and stuck in that grow. I would not
[10:44.910 --> 10:47.790]  have been able to find my way out of there. I would have tripped over things, broke a
[10:47.830 --> 10:51.790]  bunch of shit that could have gone terribly wrong for me. Do you have some sort of power
[10:51.790 --> 10:56.430]  backup in there? Do you have a battery powered light? They sell these little lights at all
[10:56.430 --> 11:01.030]  the plastic stores, the stores that sell the plastic shit. One of them looks like a light
[11:01.030 --> 11:05.590]  switch and you actually can just glue it or tape it to the wall. It's got its own self-adhesive
[11:05.590 --> 11:08.310]  on the back and it sticks to the wall and it's a light switch. When you flip it up,
[11:08.310 --> 11:11.870]  the light comes on. When you switch it down, the light goes off. It is battery powered.
[11:11.870 --> 11:15.150]  That way if the electricity goes out, it's still got a battery in there. You can use
[11:15.150 --> 11:18.230]  that, flip that on, maybe find your way out of the grow or something like that. They also
[11:18.230 --> 11:21.710]  sell some that are just little domes. You tap them and they come on, you tap them and
[11:21.710 --> 11:26.310]  they go off. I'm sure you've seen them on TV. There has seen on TV sort of items. Like
[11:26.310 --> 11:30.190]  I said, they sell those at all the plastic stores or maybe just get yourself a little
[11:30.190 --> 11:34.270]  carry flashlight or a lot of us have our cell phone already, but have some sort of light
[11:34.270 --> 11:39.790]  in case the power does go out in there. Then do you know an electrician or have an electrician
[11:39.790 --> 11:45.030]  friend or somebody that at least knows a little bit about electrical and wiring? Because if
[11:45.030 --> 11:49.670]  you do experience a problem in your home and you are in an illegal state, are you able
[11:49.670 --> 11:54.710]  to actually call whoever is in the phone book or on the internet for electrical services?
[11:54.710 --> 11:59.230]  You may need somebody on your team that can handle electrical. Be very careful messing
[11:59.230 --> 12:03.590]  with electricity. Don't do it yourself if you're not qualified. Don't burn the house
[12:03.590 --> 12:07.390]  down because you decided to do electrical upgrades on your own and you have no idea
[12:07.390 --> 12:11.670]  what you're doing. That puts a very bad look on the cannabis industry. That's going to
[12:11.670 --> 12:16.510]  get you in trouble. That's just a step back for the legalization and the freedom of cannabis.
[12:16.510 --> 12:22.110]  So don't be that person. Make friends with an electrician. Do you know an electrician?
[12:22.110 --> 12:26.710]  Find somebody that maybe works at an electric company or works for an electrical company
[12:26.710 --> 12:30.170]  that does installs or something and buddy up with them and see if they'll come do work
[12:30.170 --> 12:36.430]  for you on the side so you don't have to involve too many receipts and books and things like
[12:36.430 --> 12:40.350]  that. Just find a friend is what I'm trying to say. Be careful is what I'm telling you.
[12:40.350 --> 12:45.990]  Also, same thing applies for an HVAC technician. If the air conditioner or the heater does
[12:45.990 --> 12:50.030]  go out in your house and you happen to be growing in that house, do you want to call
[12:50.030 --> 12:53.870]  whatever it is, local ABC heating and plumbing? Do you want them in your house or do you want
[12:53.870 --> 12:58.790]  one of the bros that you could probably pay with some product if things go right? Find
[12:58.790 --> 13:03.210]  an HVAC guy, find a plumber and find a friend that you can call if you're to hurt yourself
[13:03.210 --> 13:07.750]  and find a friend that can back you up if you do need water. It'd be really cool if
[13:07.870 --> 13:11.670]  this is all one person, but that would be a bad motherfucker. You got a plumber, you
[13:11.670 --> 13:16.270]  got an electrician, you got an HVAC guy. I'm like an apprentice in all of those. After
[13:16.270 --> 13:20.630]  working and grows for so long, I feel like I can fake my way through most of those. Do
[13:20.630 --> 13:24.830]  you know all those guys? Find those guys. They'll be very, very helpful and beneficial
[13:24.830 --> 13:29.570]  to you. Some other things I want to talk about is do you have backup pumps? If you're running
[13:29.570 --> 13:35.390]  hydroponics or any sort of moving water sort of system, deep water culture, trays, ebb
[13:35.390 --> 13:38.990]  and flow, do you have a backup pump? Do you have a backup air pump and a backup water
[13:38.990 --> 13:45.590]  pump? Because those things love to shit out at the worst time. Usually like Friday, 7
[13:45.590 --> 13:48.790]  o'clock right after the growth store closed and you got plans for the weekend, you're
[13:48.790 --> 13:51.830]  going to hear a gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, and that's going to be your pump not
[13:51.830 --> 13:54.310]  pumping water the way that it should be. You're going to take it apart. You're going to try
[13:54.310 --> 13:57.290]  to clean it. You can put it back together, throw it in there and smoke's going to come
[13:57.290 --> 14:00.790]  out of it. It's still fucked. You got to go get a new Mondi pump. Everything's closed.
[14:00.790 --> 14:04.870]  You're going to ruin your weekend. Have a backup. I know they're a little bit expensive,
[14:04.870 --> 14:08.450]  but everything is expensive. If you can have a backup pump, that is one of the things I
[14:08.450 --> 14:15.710]  definitely recommend having a backup of. I also like to have a backup pH tester because
[14:15.710 --> 14:19.310]  sometimes my pH tester, I don't believe it. I'll calibrate it. I'll check it. I'll throw
[14:19.310 --> 14:22.990]  it in there and if just maybe something will make me concerned, I'll check it with the
[14:22.990 --> 14:27.710]  other one. I like to have two just because shit does go haywire. Keep them both calibrated
[14:27.710 --> 14:33.150]  and cleaned properly. Calibrate them frequently. Pay a lot of attention. Also, maybe have backup
[14:33.150 --> 14:37.830]  testing standards because if you test it in your seven solution, you test it in your four
[14:37.830 --> 14:43.750]  and one of those is expired. Now you're way off. Have a backup testing standard solution
[14:43.750 --> 14:47.150]  as well. Now we're just getting crazy here, but these are things I do like to have backups
[14:47.150 --> 14:53.190]  of. Something I don't need a backup of. Something I want a couple of around in the grow, especially
[14:53.190 --> 14:57.150]  since I've learned the commercial growing environment, you need them every so many feet
[14:57.150 --> 15:01.350]  apart. It's either 50 or 150 feet. I like to have a fire extinguisher. Do you guys have
[15:01.350 --> 15:05.550]  a fire extinguisher in your grow space? I don't want you to need it, but I'd rather
[15:05.550 --> 15:09.430]  you have it and not need it than need it and be like, fuck, I don't have anything. And
[15:09.430 --> 15:15.110]  you're just throwing reservoir water on a fire. That would be terrible. Also, do you
[15:15.110 --> 15:20.070]  have an eye wash station or some sort of eye washing plan? A lot of people do have their
[15:20.070 --> 15:24.590]  grow at home, but a lot of people don't have access to water right away. In a commercial
[15:24.590 --> 15:29.510]  environment, we need water very close. We need a eye wash station very close for the
[15:29.510 --> 15:34.030]  department of health and the OSHA standards. I recommend that you carry a bottle of clean
[15:34.030 --> 15:38.670]  water on you or within reach in your grow. If you get something in your eyes, tear off
[15:38.670 --> 15:42.110]  your gloves. You should be wearing gloves. Tear off your gloves. Get that clean water
[15:42.110 --> 15:46.350]  bottle. Start pouring that water in your eyes. Get that contaminant or whatever it is out
[15:46.350 --> 15:51.230]  of your eyes. Then if you need to pull out the phone, bust out the, Hey Siri, then call
[15:51.230 --> 15:54.870]  that one good friend that can come help you out and make sure you're safe and help you
[15:54.870 --> 15:58.630]  clean up. Talk you down from the panic attack that you just fucking had from getting pH
[15:58.630 --> 16:03.030]  down or whatever it was in your eyes. All right, where are we? I feel like I'm getting
[16:03.030 --> 16:06.750]  rambly. I've got a lot of notes here that I do want to keep up on. All right, the next
[16:06.750 --> 16:09.990]  part I'm going to talk about is a little bit weird, but it's something that I do feel like
[16:09.990 --> 16:16.930]  we should be prepared for, especially if you are in a red state or a non friendly state.
[16:16.930 --> 16:23.550]  How quickly can you make your entire operation disappear? Let's just say hypothetically,
[16:23.550 --> 16:27.650]  you piss somebody off. It happens. People are fucking sensitive nowadays. Let's just
[16:27.650 --> 16:31.050]  say somebody gets mad at you and they know what you're doing and they go to the wrong
[16:31.050 --> 16:36.330]  people and now the people are coming within 12 to 36 hours. They're going to be not even
[16:36.330 --> 16:39.870]  knocking on your front door. They're going to be pulling the fucking front door off.
[16:39.870 --> 16:45.830]  Can you make your shit disappear within 12 to 24 to 36 hours with no sign that it was
[16:45.830 --> 16:52.350]  even there? Can you get rid of it? If you do so, make sure you get rid of everything
[16:52.350 --> 16:57.090]  all the way down to the mixing shot glasses, all the way down to the instructional books.
[16:57.090 --> 17:01.590]  Clean up very well. Do not leave a trace that anything has happened, will happen, could
[17:01.590 --> 17:07.410]  have happened. No trace, leave no trace. How quickly can you do that? If you were in a
[17:07.410 --> 17:11.990]  place where growing is not approved, tolerated or accepted, that may be something that you
[17:11.990 --> 17:16.230]  want to think about. You may want to be able to get rid of that quite quickly if things
[17:16.230 --> 17:21.190]  do go wrong for you. Do you have a plan? Do you have a strategy? Also, very importantly,
[17:21.190 --> 17:25.870]  it helps to have a good friend to help you stay level headed when things like that do
[17:25.870 --> 17:27.950]  happen. So do you have a bro that can back you up?
[17:27.950 --> 17:32.750]  All right. There is one more person that we do want to make sure to have on our team.
[17:32.750 --> 17:37.510]  If we are going to be growing cannabis in any legal or illegal sort of fashion, which
[17:37.510 --> 17:41.390]  by the way, I should make a disclaimer, Rasta Jeff and the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[17:41.390 --> 17:46.470]  does not condone, promote or encourage you to do anything illegal. Always follow local
[17:46.470 --> 17:49.770]  laws and regulations. Don't break the rules, but you're a fucking adult. Do what you want
[17:49.770 --> 17:56.150]  to do. Rasta Jeff is also a fictional character and this is an entertainment show, so that's
[17:56.150 --> 17:59.830]  how that's going to go. With that being said, the other person that you should always have
[17:59.830 --> 18:06.830]  on your team if you are going to cultivate, consume, possess, carry, transport, be anything
[18:06.870 --> 18:11.790]  involved in cannabis or almost anything fun or illegal, I almost insist that you have
[18:11.790 --> 18:16.950]  got a good working relationship with a lawyer. Lawyers are readily available. A lot of them
[18:16.950 --> 18:22.070]  are terrible. Many of them are fucking awesome and can be your best friend. Just like your
[18:22.070 --> 18:27.350]  doctor, I recommend you are totally open with your lawyer. Once you've paid them money,
[18:27.350 --> 18:32.710]  everything you say has a client lawyer confidentiality clause. They can't snitch on you, rat on
[18:32.710 --> 18:36.750]  you. If you kill somebody, they may be required to tell on you for that. I don't think so
[18:36.750 --> 18:40.950]  but if you're doing crime and you do something or if you did something or if you've got something
[18:40.950 --> 18:45.190]  weird that is in a gray area, they cannot get you in trouble. It is best you let them
[18:45.190 --> 18:49.350]  know what you're doing so they can prepare. You can't properly prepare if they don't know
[18:49.350 --> 18:53.310]  what you're doing, so let them know exactly what you're up to. If you've got an idea,
[18:53.310 --> 18:57.270]  if you're going to do something weird, if you're just curious about something, contact
[18:57.270 --> 19:01.070]  them. That's what they're there for. You pay them. Try to pay them a monthly fee if you
[19:01.070 --> 19:05.230]  can for a certain amount of contacts or have a retainer. Just have a relationship with
[19:05.230 --> 19:09.470]  the lawyer. Make friendship with them if you can. Go to lunch with them if you can.
[19:09.470 --> 19:13.590]  Buy them lunch occasionally. Call them. Just check in. Just see how things are going. Maybe
[19:13.590 --> 19:16.990]  they'll call in and check in with you. That way when shit goes wrong, if it's three in
[19:16.990 --> 19:20.910]  the morning, if it's one in the afternoon, when you call them, they answer on the first
[19:20.910 --> 19:23.990]  ring. That is what you want from your lawyer. A lawyer that's going to answer on the first
[19:23.990 --> 19:29.190]  ring and do the work to get the case dismissed because we all know you were not doing anything
[19:29.190 --> 19:35.430]  illegal or wrong or problematic or whatever. I'm getting off track here, but I do recommend
[19:35.430 --> 19:39.790]  that you've got the lawyer. We need somebody that can help us out on a backup day. We need
[19:39.790 --> 19:42.830]  somebody that can help us out if we are injured or have an emergency. We need someone that
[19:42.830 --> 19:46.390]  can help us make the grow disappear. It's always good to have an electrician and an
[19:46.390 --> 19:51.970]  HVAC guy. Most importantly, I always recommend that you've got yourself a lawyer and then
[19:51.970 --> 19:55.830]  get a bunch of grow books and keep reading those. That's what I recommend.
[19:55.830 --> 19:59.250]  That part took me right as long as I was hoping it would take. I do have one more part
[19:59.250 --> 20:04.270]  of this podcast that I do want to cover. Recently, I did a podcast called Why I Started Making
[20:04.270 --> 20:09.990]  Seeds. I did a really long storytelling with Rasta Jeff, if you will. As I was editing
[20:09.990 --> 20:14.850]  and listening to that, so many more thoughts and memories and nostalgic feelings came through
[20:14.850 --> 20:21.930]  my mind. I forgot one minor major detail, something that I felt like I should have included
[20:21.930 --> 20:26.770]  in that. I talk a lot about making seeds and getting seeds out to people so that people
[20:26.770 --> 20:32.970]  can grow quality plants. One thing that was happening is I was posting pictures of things
[20:32.970 --> 20:38.130]  like golden goat. Golden goat is a very good example. I would post pictures of golden goat
[20:38.130 --> 20:43.170]  and people in other locations would say, you kids in Colorado are spoiled. You get the
[20:43.170 --> 20:46.410]  golden goat. We can't get the golden goat where I am. I would kill for that. I would
[20:46.410 --> 20:50.930]  do anything for that. Me being the type of person that I am, I want everybody to have
[20:50.930 --> 20:55.130]  good medicine. That was part of my mission here. It still is part of my mission. I'm
[20:55.130 --> 20:57.890]  out here teaching you how to grow the best herb you can. I've taught you guys how to
[20:57.890 --> 21:02.410]  breed by now. I'm a seed breeder by career. I'm teaching you how to breed your own seeds.
[21:02.410 --> 21:07.250]  That's how much I love this plant and love teaching you guys. I wanted everybody to have
[21:07.250 --> 21:13.410]  access to good quality genetics, good seeds at a good fair price. Many, many people wanted
[21:13.410 --> 21:19.770]  the golden goat. I took it upon myself to make golden goat feminized seeds. That was
[21:19.890 --> 21:23.210]  one of the things I really wanted to do was put some of these elite cuts into people's
[21:23.210 --> 21:29.610]  hands in a feminized form. The golden goat is a very good example of me putting a feminized
[21:29.610 --> 21:35.450]  line of a very elite clone only out to the market for people all over the world to be
[21:35.450 --> 21:41.250]  able to grow and enjoy. Making fem seeds and making S1s of clone only was something I really
[21:41.250 --> 21:47.510]  enjoyed doing because that was making it more fair for everybody. I like the idea of everybody
[21:47.750 --> 21:52.950]  having the same, the equal playing field. Why should some people in Colorado be able
[21:52.950 --> 21:58.550]  to produce better medicine than people in Wyoming or New Mexico or Arizona or even California?
[21:58.550 --> 22:02.230]  Why should the people in California be able to produce better medicine than the people
[22:02.230 --> 22:07.230]  in Colorado or New York or the same states? We should all have access to the same thing.
[22:07.230 --> 22:11.950]  If you're sick, you need medicine. That was my theory. That is still my theory. If you're
[22:11.950 --> 22:15.950]  sick, why would I not get you the golden goat that would make you feel better just because
[22:15.950 --> 22:19.830]  you're not in the correct state? That's fucking stupid. That's silly. That's what the government
[22:19.830 --> 22:24.270]  has been doing. They've been limiting you, us on medicine because you're not in the appropriate
[22:24.270 --> 22:29.070]  square that allows you to consume cannabis. This square, no weed, no relief, no feeling
[22:29.070 --> 22:32.950]  good. This square, you could feel good, you could smoke weed. I don't want to do that.
[22:32.950 --> 22:37.950]  I think that every state, everywhere, every country, every sick person, every well person
[22:37.950 --> 22:42.910]  should feel good and or better was my theory behind that. I wanted to add that short rant,
[22:42.910 --> 22:47.510]  that minor detail, that point of passion, if you will, to this part of the podcast,
[22:47.510 --> 22:52.230]  make that another part B of why I started breeding seeds because I wanted it to be fair.
[22:52.230 --> 22:58.190]  I don't want to have just me with elite genetics. That's not fair. I love having elite genetics.
[22:58.190 --> 23:01.790]  It's fucking cool. That way everybody around here gets to grow and breed with elite fucking
[23:01.790 --> 23:06.390]  genetics. Everybody's well medicated, super high and having a good time. Then part of
[23:06.390 --> 23:10.910]  my passion is making people feel better, not a limited amount of people. Everybody, let's
[23:10.910 --> 23:14.710]  be fair. Let's get that shit out there. That was a big part of why I wanted to make FEMS,
[23:14.710 --> 23:19.030]  especially S1s. That's a big part of why I'm getting the seeds out there so that everybody
[23:19.030 --> 23:23.830]  can grow the good shit and feel better. That's the bottom line. Everybody grow the best we
[23:23.830 --> 23:29.470]  can so the sick people can feel well and the well people can feel even better. All right.
[23:29.470 --> 23:34.150]  I think that is a good way and a good time to start wrapping up this podcast. Thank you
