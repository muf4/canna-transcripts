[00:00.000 --> 00:04.960]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It's time for episode 413 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.960 --> 00:09.920]  podcast. This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.920 --> 00:14.040]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:14.040 --> 00:21.960]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com. Make sure you check out Oregon Elite Seeds for
[00:21.960 --> 00:29.520]  the first drop of the Blue Raspberry Truffles. They'll be available on 420 at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.160]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I am smoking.
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.360]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Tropicana Cookies Fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.160]  Farms. I picked this up at the Ambrosia Days. I was really lucky to score a four-gram jar
[00:44.160 --> 00:52.280]  of this amazing concentrate. The label says it contains 72.4% THC and a total of 85% total
[00:52.280 --> 00:57.040]  cannabinoids. This concentrate tastes delicious. I took a big, chunky dab. It made me kind
[00:57.040 --> 01:00.100]  of sit back in the chair for a couple of minutes, but once that initial punch to the
[01:00.100 --> 01:04.840]  face wore off, it has got me in a really good mood.
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I am going to read a couple of listener emails,
[01:08.640 --> 01:13.120]  but before we get there, I owe a couple of people some shout-outs. How about a big shout-out
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.360]  to my friend Tyler Radke? How about a big shout-out to John Milk? Another big shout-out
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.880]  to Joseph Gada. A big shout-out to Keith Klump. How about a big shout-out to my friend Artem
[01:21.880 --> 01:27.200]  Ziranoff? And of course, a shout-out to our friend Sam. I really do appreciate all of
[01:27.200 --> 01:30.960]  the Patreon support. And if you would like to learn how to become a patron and get a
[01:30.960 --> 01:36.520]  Patreon shout-out at the start of the show, all you need to do is go to patreon.com slash

[01:40.960 --> 01:41.960]  the screen.
[01:41.960 --> 01:45.880]  All right, podcast world. I said that in this episode, I was going to read some listener
[01:45.880 --> 01:51.400]  emails. Let's get right to it. This first email goes just like this. It says, hey, Jeff,
[01:51.400 --> 01:56.400]  I wanted to start off by saying that your podcasts are the best hands down. Hey, I appreciate
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.680]  that great compliment. Thank you. I do appreciate hearing that people think I am the best. I'm
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.440]  not in it for competition, but it always feels good knowing that you're winning.
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.100]  Then he says, I've learned so much. Hey, I appreciate that. I'm glad that you're learning.
[02:09.100 --> 02:14.100]  The message goes on to say, so I have a question. I am starting my second grow using Roots Organic
[02:14.100 --> 02:19.340]  Soil and CannaVega Organic Supplements, which worked great on my first grow. Hey, congrats
[02:19.340 --> 02:23.380]  on the first grow. I'm glad that worked out for you. He continues to say, I am growing
[02:23.380 --> 02:30.500]  in a four foot by three foot by six foot tent with two HLG V2 288 LED lights.
[02:30.500 --> 02:35.540]  All right, so I've got a good visual of your setup. That is a great way to diagnose a problem
[02:35.540 --> 02:38.940]  or help me figure out what you've got going on. Give me a good description of your setup.
[02:38.940 --> 02:43.140]  I've got a good visual of what's happening in this grow. The message says, so I am growing
[02:43.140 --> 02:50.740]  two Pineapple Express by Fast Buds and one Pink Kush CBD by Seedsmen. All are auto flowers.
[02:50.740 --> 02:55.580]  I was told by a few people that it's not safe with my other plants since this is a 30 to
[02:55.580 --> 03:01.100]  1 CBD plant and can affect my two pineapples. I'm not sure how, but it has me concerned
[03:01.100 --> 03:04.940]  with their background. I'm not sure how that would make a difference since they are all
[03:04.940 --> 03:11.540]  auto females, but I have heard hemp plants being an issue with pollinating non-CBD plants.
[03:11.540 --> 03:16.000]  The plants just started veg. Should I separate them? Then he says, thanks Rasta Jeff. You
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.180]  are a beast. Take a fat dab and hug your mom. Then they sign their name from BAFSTA. Shout
[03:22.180 --> 03:26.340]  out to BAFSTA. Thanks for the great message. Let's talk about this for a second.
[03:26.340 --> 03:30.120]  You've got a really great setup it sounds like, and you've got some quality genetics.
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.140]  You've got two Pineapple Express in there from Fast Buds. Those are quality seeds. You've
[03:34.140 --> 03:39.540]  got one Pink Kush CBD from Seedsmen, who is also another reputable breeder. Those are
[03:39.540 --> 03:44.340]  all auto flowers. So far, everything should work well, but you were told by people that
[03:44.340 --> 03:50.700]  it is not safe to have your CBD plants with your not CBD plants. Then you said you're
[03:50.700 --> 03:53.860]  not sure that it makes a difference because they are all females. They are all females,
[03:53.860 --> 03:59.220]  so you have no chance of pollination. You have heard that hemp plants being an issue
[03:59.220 --> 04:04.540]  with pollinating non-CBD plants. That would be possible if you had a male, but you don't
[04:04.540 --> 04:10.140]  have any males. You need a male to create pollen, or you need to do some reversing or
[04:10.140 --> 04:14.580]  some stressing to cause a hermaphrodite, but you don't have a male. Hopefully, you've got
[04:14.580 --> 04:19.900]  three solid females, so there will be no problem. There is no way that your CBD plants are going
[04:19.900 --> 04:24.700]  to affect your non-CBD plants. That is not a thing. That's nothing to worry about in
[04:24.700 --> 04:29.940]  your indoor environment. Now, if you were in an outdoor environment, those plants would
[04:29.940 --> 04:35.820]  be able to receive pollen from cannabis or hemp. If there were a male hemp plant or a
[04:35.820 --> 04:40.940]  male cannabis plant somewhere in the vicinity and some wind picked up some pollen, or a
[04:40.940 --> 04:45.300]  bird picked up some pollen, or an insect, one of our pollinator friends grabbed some
[04:45.300 --> 04:50.540]  pollen, traveled from that male plant over to your female auto flower plants, yes, they
[04:50.540 --> 04:56.180]  could be pollinated that way. But again, we need a male. We need a pollinator plant to
[04:56.180 --> 05:00.980]  add pollen to your females. You said you've got three females. Unless you introduce some
[05:00.980 --> 05:06.180]  pollen, you will be just fine. There should be no issues. So I completely understand what
[05:06.180 --> 05:10.140]  you're asking, and I hope I have answered your question thoroughly. In short, you've
[05:10.140 --> 05:14.220]  got three girls. Where's the pollen going to come from that is going to pollinate these
[05:14.220 --> 05:17.960]  plants? You either need a male, you need to reverse a female, or you need one of those
[05:17.960 --> 05:22.300]  females to hermaphrodite due to stress or poor breeding, which is always an option,
[05:22.300 --> 05:26.100]  but that's not what we're talking about now. Now we're talking about you've got three females,
[05:26.100 --> 05:30.900]  so you are not going to have any pollen. Now, let me elaborate a little on this subject
[05:30.900 --> 05:37.260]  because something that I see happening in the near future is a very realistic concern.
[05:37.260 --> 05:44.220]  Many people in many places are growing large scale outdoor hemp projects. In those same
[05:44.220 --> 05:51.580]  areas, people are growing large scale outdoor cannabis projects. Now the Department of Ag
[05:51.580 --> 05:55.900]  and horticulture experts and other people will argue this statement, but currently,
[05:56.700 --> 06:02.460]  what differentiates your cannabis from your hemp is basically a lab test at this point.
[06:02.460 --> 06:06.700]  If you're finished dried and cured product, the product that is tested by the lab,
[06:06.700 --> 06:13.980]  if that product contains 0.3% THC, you have got a cannabis plant. If that product contains less
[06:13.980 --> 06:21.500]  than 0.3% THC, you have got a hemp plant. But in all reality, there is nothing stopping a
[06:21.580 --> 06:27.020]  cannabis plant from receiving hemp pollen. There is nothing stopping a hemp plant from receiving
[06:27.020 --> 06:34.460]  cannabis pollen. We have got a lot of new farmers that are jumping on the hemp and CBD bandwagon.
[06:34.460 --> 06:39.980]  They're buying big chunks of land, which may be right next to our medical and recreational cannabis
[06:39.980 --> 06:45.340]  farms, and they're setting up their hemp farm in that same area. Many of these people are growing
[06:45.340 --> 06:53.020]  from seed. There are a lot of new seed breeders and vendors in the hemp game. I'm sure many of
[06:53.020 --> 06:57.980]  those seeds are problematic. I'm sure that a lot of people are selling feminized seeds that are
[06:57.980 --> 07:04.620]  not done properly. I think it is a safe guess to predict that in the very near future, some of
[07:04.620 --> 07:09.900]  these outdoor hemp fields are going to get out of control. They're going to miss a male, and we are
[07:09.900 --> 07:16.460]  going to pollinate some of our outdoor medical and recreational cannabis crops with rogue pollen
[07:16.460 --> 07:21.820]  from hemp that came from another farm from an irresponsible farmer. I see it happening. I know
[07:21.820 --> 07:26.220]  it will happen in the future. I can see it. There's nothing stopping it. There are things that we can
[07:26.220 --> 07:32.140]  do agriculturally. We can set up barriers nature-wise, but it's not going to stop every
[07:32.140 --> 07:36.700]  piece of pollen. We can't stop a pollinator insect or a pollinator bird. We can't stop all of the
[07:36.700 --> 07:41.900]  wind. It is going to happen. I bet that in the very near future, we are going to see outdoor
[07:41.900 --> 07:48.380]  cannabis and hemp crops that are not destroyed but partially ruined because they were pollinated
[07:48.380 --> 07:53.660]  by irresponsible farmers that did not identify and cull the males in their outdoor hemp or
[07:53.660 --> 07:57.900]  cannabis garden. This could happen in a hemp or a cannabis garden. I'm assuming it's going to be
[07:57.900 --> 08:01.900]  more common in a hemp field because that's a little bit more new of an industry to a lot of
[08:01.900 --> 08:07.100]  people, but this is going to be a thing in the very near future. However, let's get back on track.
[08:07.900 --> 08:12.140]  Mr. Bafsta, I do not believe that this is an issue you need to worry about in your indoor
[08:12.140 --> 08:16.780]  grow. You don't have a male plant, so nothing is going to get pollinated. Bafsta wraps up this
[08:16.780 --> 08:20.940]  message by saying, thanks, Rasta Jeff. You are a beast. Hey, I appreciate that. I like
[08:20.940 --> 08:25.500]  supporting the community. I'm glad that you find me to be a beast. Then he says, take a fat dab
[08:25.500 --> 08:31.340]  and hug your mom. I just took a gigantic dab, and I promise you I'll give mama a hug the next time I
[08:31.340 --> 08:35.500]  see her. Hey, Bafsta, thank you for the great message. I look forward to hearing from you in
[08:35.500 --> 08:40.860]  the future. All right, I've got another email in front of me. This one is good. It goes like this.
[08:40.860 --> 08:44.700]  First and foremost, thank you for doing the podcast. It is excellent. Hey, you're very
[08:44.700 --> 08:48.700]  welcome. Thank you for the great compliment. They said you make the world a little better,
[08:48.700 --> 08:53.100]  man. Much appreciated. Hey, I appreciate those kind of compliments. That means a lot to me.
[08:53.660 --> 08:58.060]  The email goes on. It says, my question is about how to rejuvenate a flowered plant.
[08:58.060 --> 09:03.260]  I have an amazing Jamaican blueberry that I do not have clones of, and I would love to save.
[09:03.980 --> 09:08.860]  Jamaican blueberry? That sounds delicious. I would have definitely taken a clone of that one.
[09:08.860 --> 09:12.700]  The message goes on. It says, I always take clones off of my cultivars before they flower,
[09:12.700 --> 09:16.860]  but something weird happened with this one. It all of a sudden started flowering in the
[09:16.860 --> 09:21.420]  bedroom. At first, I thought I had received some auto-flowered seeds by mistake.
[09:21.420 --> 09:25.340]  Seeing that other plants from the same seeds in different parts of the bedroom were not flowering,
[09:25.340 --> 09:29.580]  I investigated further. I found a nearby plant of a different cultivar,
[09:29.580 --> 09:35.420]  supposedly feminized, had hermaphrodited and developed just one small set of pollen sacks.
[09:35.420 --> 09:40.940]  It is my understanding that if pollen sacks show up in a bedroom, they can cause female plants in
[09:40.940 --> 09:47.580]  the bedroom to start to flower. I believe that is what happened to me. I would strongly disagree.
[09:47.580 --> 09:53.180]  I do not think, I do not believe, I do not understand why. I do not think that a hermaphrodited
[09:53.180 --> 09:58.860]  plant in that room would encourage the other plants to flower. That is not a thing. I do not
[09:58.860 --> 10:05.980]  believe that pollen sacks from your hermaphroditic, feminized plant are what caused your other female
[10:05.980 --> 10:09.740]  plants in that bedroom to begin to flower. I would strongly disagree with that.
[10:09.740 --> 10:14.700]  From your message, what I strongly believe has happened is you do not have enough light
[10:14.700 --> 10:19.580]  in your bedroom. You've either got too little light, not enough intensity, or you've got the
[10:19.580 --> 10:24.780]  wrong spectrum, or perhaps the light is too far from the canopy, or even you've got the plants
[10:24.780 --> 10:30.620]  too squished together and they are just frustrated. I would guess that that one feminized cultivar
[10:30.620 --> 10:35.100]  that you found the hermaphroditic flowers on, I'm going to guess it is in the corner, it is
[10:35.100 --> 10:39.420]  furthest from the light, and that hermaphrodite flower is somewhere near the bottom where it is
[10:39.420 --> 10:44.380]  not getting enough light. The main thing that decides when a plant flowers is genetics. You
[10:44.380 --> 10:48.700]  said you believe you do not have autoflowers, and we are seeing that some plants in your room are
[10:48.700 --> 10:53.020]  flowering and some are not, so that leads me to believe you don't have autoflowers.
[10:53.020 --> 10:58.460]  The next contributing factor that decides when your plants flower is light. Light interval,
[10:58.460 --> 11:03.660]  light intensity, light duration, is it all dialed in? You're telling me that these plants are
[11:03.660 --> 11:08.300]  starting to flower while they are in veg. It leads me to believe that you don't have enough
[11:08.300 --> 11:13.420]  light in there, and those select phenotypes that are flowering just have a little bit different
[11:13.420 --> 11:17.980]  light sensitivity than the phenotypes which have not chosen to flower on you. So my first question
[11:17.980 --> 11:22.300]  is going to be, what kind of light are you using? How intense is that light? How close to the
[11:22.300 --> 11:27.580]  canopy is that light fixture? Then I want to know, what is your light schedule? How many hours per
[11:27.580 --> 11:33.100]  day are you running that light? How are the plants reacting to it? They're obviously trying to flower,
[11:33.100 --> 11:38.540]  so I don't think they're getting enough light. Also, you have got two Jamaican blueberry plants
[11:38.540 --> 11:43.420]  in here. Think about where those plants came from. They came from Jamaica. Think about the
[11:43.420 --> 11:49.660]  environment in Jamaica. Think about the photo period in Jamaica. These plants want bright,
[11:49.660 --> 11:55.580]  intense, long daylight. So these plants probably expect really bright, long, hot days, and they're
[11:55.580 --> 11:59.900]  probably not getting that in your grow environment. The message goes on. It says,
[11:59.900 --> 12:05.500]  two Jamaican blueberry plants have started to flower. I immediately took clones off of both.
[12:05.500 --> 12:10.940]  I was able to get clones to root no problem on one of them, but none of the clones of the other
[12:10.940 --> 12:16.380]  have survived. Now, as they are nearing completion, as fate would have it, the one I could not get
[12:16.380 --> 12:22.220]  clones to root looks unbelievable, which leads me back to my original question. Can you help me
[12:22.220 --> 12:27.740]  rejuvenate this plant after flower? Is there a podcast number that discusses this topic, or
[12:27.740 --> 12:34.540]  is there any other advice that you can give? Thank you in advance, signed TJ. Hey, TJ, I don't
[12:34.540 --> 12:39.260]  remember if I have done a rejuvenation episode, so I'm going to press pause. I'm going to search for
[12:39.260 --> 12:43.260]  that right quick. And then when I get back, I'll let you know what number it was, if I've done it.
[12:43.260 --> 12:49.260]  And if not, we're going to talk about rejuvenating and revegging your Jamaican blueberry plants.
[12:51.260 --> 12:55.420]  All right, I gave it a quick check, and I have done a revegging episode. I've done an entire
[12:55.420 --> 13:00.380]  episode on revegging our cannabis plants. It is episode number 152. I'm sure I go into great
[13:00.380 --> 13:04.780]  detail in that episode. So if you want to learn more about revegging your flowered cannabis
[13:04.780 --> 13:10.700]  plants, I highly recommend revisiting episode 152. But we are here now, and you are asking the
[13:10.700 --> 13:17.020]  question today. So let's talk really briefly, a quick lesson on revegging flowered cannabis plants.
[13:17.580 --> 13:24.220]  This may sound crazy, but successful revegging, simple, successful revegging starts late in flower.
[13:24.220 --> 13:29.580]  When you start flushing approximately two weeks before harvest, I suggest you turn the lights back
[13:29.580 --> 13:35.500]  to 24 hours on and zero hours off. What? Everyone's head just blew up. We're in the end of
[13:35.500 --> 13:39.100]  flower. We're trying to flush our plants, and you're telling this person to put his lights on
[13:39.100 --> 13:45.180]  24 hours on and zero hours off. Yes, we are so late in the flowering cycle that we are not going
[13:45.180 --> 13:49.340]  to disrupt the flowering. We are about to cut them down. So as soon as we see any problems,
[13:49.340 --> 13:53.900]  we're going to chop the plants. Don't even worry about it. We want to reverse the hormones in this
[13:53.900 --> 13:58.780]  plant. This plant is full on in old lady mode. It is at the end of its life cycle. We need to
[13:58.780 --> 14:03.340]  convince this plant that it wants to go from old lady back to a young girl so that we can start
[14:03.340 --> 14:08.220]  fresh with her. The only way we can do that is to make this plant think it is a different season.
[14:08.220 --> 14:13.020]  We need to make this plant think that it is spring and it is time to start over. So we want to put
[14:13.020 --> 14:17.900]  the light cycle in a spring type condition. We don't want this plant to sleep at all. That is
[14:17.900 --> 14:22.780]  when the flowering is induced, is during those dark cycles. So we want to leave it on as much
[14:22.780 --> 14:27.180]  as possible. 24 hours of the most intense light you can give it. If you can put it under a thousand
[14:27.180 --> 14:33.100]  watt light, that is where you want it. 24 hours a day of a thousand watt light for our reveg process.
[14:33.100 --> 14:39.740]  So start that 14 days before you intend to harvest your plant. You can flush this plant just like
[14:39.740 --> 14:43.900]  you're flushing the rest of the plants. Continue to flush. Do everything just like you would,
[14:43.900 --> 14:49.740]  except we want the lights on for 24 hours on and zero hours off. Now when harvest comes,
[14:50.220 --> 14:57.340]  harvest almost like you would any other harvest, except we want to leave the bottom two or four
[14:57.340 --> 15:01.980]  or maybe six little tiny popcorn buds on this plant. Just some bottoms. We don't need much
[15:01.980 --> 15:08.220]  here to reveg. The less is better when it comes to trying to reveg a plant. So you've got it on 24
[15:08.220 --> 15:12.780]  hours for two weeks before harvest. Harvest time comes, we chop down the majority of the plant. We
[15:12.780 --> 15:17.500]  leave four little tiny buds on the bottom, maybe six, maybe eight, just a bunch of little buds on
[15:17.500 --> 15:21.580]  the bottom we don't need a lot to work with. So you've got these little buds on the bottom,
[15:21.580 --> 15:28.620]  just leave those on that 24 hour light cycle. Feed them a heavy veg mix. We need a lot of nitrogen.
[15:28.620 --> 15:34.220]  We need minimal amounts of phosphorus and potassium. I would recommend high doses of kelp
[15:34.220 --> 15:39.980]  and of course a lot of microbes. The soil, that root ball has been around for quite some time.
[15:39.980 --> 15:44.140]  It's probably root bound. If you can pot it into a larger pot without causing damage,
[15:44.140 --> 15:49.820]  that may be advantageous also. So get it in a bigger pot if you can, feed it some strong veg
[15:49.820 --> 15:54.380]  nudes with a lot of nitrogen. Again, I recommend a kelp product, something like liquid karma or
[15:54.380 --> 16:00.140]  something in that vein would work wonderfully for you. Keep it on a 24 hour light cycle until
[16:00.140 --> 16:06.700]  you see those buds start producing normal looking leaves. For several weeks, that plant is going to
[16:06.700 --> 16:11.980]  kick out weird, weird looking leaves. They're going to be twisted. They're going to be spun
[16:11.980 --> 16:15.340]  around. They're going to look like a claw. They're not going to be the right shape. That is
[16:15.340 --> 16:20.540]  to be expected for several, several weeks, depending on your cultivar, depending on the
[16:20.540 --> 16:25.740]  plant you're working with. Re-vegging this plant could take you six, maybe eight weeks from the
[16:25.740 --> 16:31.420]  time you cut the rest of it off. So keep watching those leaves. Eventually it will grow out of that
[16:31.420 --> 16:34.940]  little bud. You've got a little bud right now. That bud is going to develop new leaves. It'll
[16:34.940 --> 16:39.660]  start stacking up and getting taller. New growth will come out of it. Eventually that new growth
[16:39.660 --> 16:44.060]  will start to look like a normal plant. It will look like what we expect and what we're hoping for
[16:44.060 --> 16:50.780]  and what we are familiar with. So once you've got that nice, healthy, familiar growth happening,
[16:50.780 --> 16:55.980]  then I suggest you take a clone from that. If you've got several healthy tops on that plant,
[16:55.980 --> 17:01.180]  and you are not a really good cloner, maybe only take one or two clones and leave one or two behind
[17:01.180 --> 17:06.700]  in case you don't have good luck with your clones. So once you've got that good growth coming out of
[17:06.700 --> 17:12.700]  the plant, it is time to clone it. Take one or two clones. Those become the mother plant. You
[17:12.700 --> 17:17.580]  don't want to run those, in my opinion. I would grow that out, and I would take five or six clones
[17:17.580 --> 17:23.020]  off of that, and that would be the next crop that I run. So let's recap real quickly my re-vegging
[17:23.020 --> 17:28.780]  process. It starts approximately two weeks before harvest. Put your lights on a 24-hour on and
[17:28.780 --> 17:35.260]  zero hours off light cycle. Then at harvest time, chop it down, but leave a few bottom buds.
[17:35.260 --> 17:38.860]  Somewhere between two and eight bottom buds. I don't know how big of a plant you've got.
[17:38.860 --> 17:42.620]  I don't know what you're working with. Leave some stuff on the bottom. That's the important part.
[17:43.260 --> 17:48.540]  Leave that part in veg. Leave it on a 24-hour light cycle with as much light as you can give it.
[17:49.100 --> 17:55.100]  Continue to feed it a heavy veg feed. You want a lot of nitrogen and again, a kelp product.
[17:55.100 --> 18:00.140]  Leave it on that veg cycle until you see it starting to produce normal looking leaves. Let
[18:00.140 --> 18:04.700]  it grow a little longer. Once it's got those normal leaves, the longer the better, but then
[18:04.700 --> 18:11.020]  clone that good looking growth and that clone becomes your new mother plant. Use that to take
[18:11.020 --> 18:16.940]  clones from and grow those clones and you should not see any loss in quality or vigor. There will
[18:16.940 --> 18:21.740]  be no, what is known as genetic drift, which we have disproven on this podcast. That is not a term
[18:21.740 --> 18:29.020]  that applies in this situation in any way. So that is my quick review on how to re-veg our cannabis
[18:29.020 --> 18:35.180]  plants. Now don't forget that you had problems cloning this specific cultivar in the past,
[18:35.180 --> 18:40.300]  so be sure to be extra careful when you were cloning at this time. What did you do wrong?
[18:40.300 --> 18:45.820]  Why would it not clone last time? Do you remember what the issue was? This is your last chance. If
[18:45.820 --> 18:50.060]  you can't get clones off of it this time, it is time to let it go. You're going to be wasting too
[18:50.060 --> 18:55.820]  much time, space and energy in this plant if it doesn't work this time. So make this one count.
[18:55.820 --> 19:00.860]  I have done entire episodes on producing clones. I've done an episode on cutting clones into rapid
[19:00.860 --> 19:05.340]  rooters. I've done an episode on cutting clones in an easy clone machine. If you need help cutting
[19:05.340 --> 19:12.300]  clones, I recommend checking out those episodes. My most recent cutting clone episode is number 364,
[19:12.300 --> 19:16.700]  so I highly recommend that one before you try cutting clones again. I'm not disrespecting your
[19:16.700 --> 19:20.620]  clone tech. I'm just saying maybe a little bit of advice will help you out since you had troubles
[19:20.620 --> 19:26.060]  with this specific cultivar in the past. I'd really hate to see you re-veg and take all of
[19:26.060 --> 19:30.300]  that time and then not even be able to get a living clone off of it. So maybe check out that
[19:30.300 --> 19:36.620]  cutting clones episode again. That is number 364. All right, I hope I answered your question, JT. Hey,
[19:36.620 --> 19:40.300]  I may have called you TJ at the start of the email. I apologize if I got your name wrong. I have a
[19:40.300 --> 19:45.580]  friend named TJ. When I saw those letters, I just wanted you to be my friend. Anyway, JT, thank you
[19:45.580 --> 19:49.660]  for the great email. I hope I answered your questions. If you have any more questions, I would
[19:49.660 --> 19:54.300]  love to hear from you. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. If anybody out
[19:54.300 --> 19:58.940]  there has a grow question, needs grow advice, has cannabis industry questions, whatever you'd like

[20:19.980 --> 20:25.100]  you can do so by visiting patreon.com slash growfromyourheart. All of the information that
[20:25.100 --> 20:29.180]  you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen. Just to let you know what I do
[20:29.180 --> 20:33.820]  with the funds that I receive from Patreon, I do things like I pay for my website. I host this
[20:33.820 --> 20:39.820]  podcast on my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com. I use those funds from Patreon to pay for the
[20:39.820 --> 20:44.940]  website to keep the podcast free for everybody. I also use those funds to pay for my internet
[20:44.940 --> 20:50.380]  connection, which also helps us get the podcast out to everybody for free. I also use the funding
[20:50.380 --> 20:54.060]  for things like these little microphone covers so that I don't have to keep smelling my own breath
[20:54.060 --> 20:57.900]  and spitting into the same microphone cover forever. Also, when Mike comes over, he gets a
[20:57.900 --> 21:01.900]  freshie cover. When Dab and Granny's on the show, she gets a freshie. Whenever I have somebody on
[21:01.900 --> 21:05.340]  the show, a new person comes, we get a new microphone cover. So you guys are covering
[21:05.340 --> 21:09.580]  things like that. Also, when equipment breaks, a while back we had a headphone amplifier take a
[21:09.580 --> 21:14.700]  shit on us, things like that are replaced with the generosity of our friends from Patreon.
[21:14.700 --> 21:18.620]  So that is what I'm doing with the funding. I do appreciate all of the past, present,
