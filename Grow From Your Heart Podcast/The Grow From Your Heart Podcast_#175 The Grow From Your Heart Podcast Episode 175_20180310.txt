[00:17.400 --> 00:21.960]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 175 of the Grow From
[00:21.960 --> 00:26.480]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.480 --> 00:29.840]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.720]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.440]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.440 --> 00:42.880]  host, my friends. Call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.080]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.680]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
[00:50.680 --> 00:56.320]  Mystic Roots crew. I did it. I got through the whole intro without coughing. Oh my goodness.
[00:56.320 --> 01:02.360]  I just took some monster dabs of some distillate over here. I got some 92% THC distillate.
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.600]  It just made my brain spin a little bit and it made my lungs try to wobble a little bit.
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to the podcast, my friend, Sammy, the Painted
[01:09.720 --> 01:12.360]  Chef. Welcome to the show, brother. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. It's a pleasure
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.560]  to be here for sure. Thanks for making the long drive down. You know, it's no big deal
[01:16.560 --> 01:19.240]  to come here and hang out with you, my man. It's great to have a long time listener and
[01:19.240 --> 01:22.080]  a long time friend here on the podcast. I haven't seen you in quite a while. It's been,
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.200]  uh, I don't know, like three or four years. It's been way too long. I apologize. My fault.
[01:26.200 --> 01:30.000]  My fault. Mine too, man. We get a little bit busy, but Hey, you know, we're just talking
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.360]  for a long time here. We're both parents and we're both proud poppers of beautiful girls.
[01:33.360 --> 01:38.040]  So we, uh, we let them consume, consume our lives, which is definitely priority. And yeah,
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.960]  big shout out for being a good father, bro. I appreciate that. Thank you, man. Yes. Yes.
[01:42.560 --> 01:45.240]  There you go. Number one thing you guys go give her, go give your kids a hug. I always
[01:45.240 --> 01:48.440]  talk about take a fat dab and give your mom a hug. Go, go give your kids a hug. Hang out
[01:48.440 --> 01:52.040]  with them for a minute. Any kiss, kiss them on the forehead. No matter how old they are,
[01:52.040 --> 01:55.480]  boy or a girl go embarrass the shit out of them. Go kiss them right on the forehead.
[01:55.480 --> 01:58.800]  Especially when their friends are around. Yeah. That's the best thing. Uh, brother,
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.680]  man, how can people find you on social media so that they can stalk you while they listen
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.080]  here? Facebook, Sammy Chonkla's. Um, does that mean shoes, bro? Yeah. What happened
[02:07.080 --> 02:10.920]  is my buddy used to make himself up a bunch of cool names on Facebook, like I'll Guapo
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.240]  and stuff. And I was clowning him, telling him, give me a name. He called me Sammy Chonkla's
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.600]  kind of stuff. You know, the Chonkla, you can't mess with the Chonkla. So whatever,
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.080]  but on Instagram and everywhere else, it's the painted chef, the painted chef. You guys go
[02:23.080 --> 02:26.680]  follow my friend, the painted chef, check him out so that you can see how sexy he is so that you
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.880]  can see his beautiful garden. He is a wonderful ganja grower. Thanks, sir. Thank you. I've learned
[02:31.880 --> 02:35.720]  a lot from a lot of people, but, uh, I just try to do my best and give the plants all the love I
[02:35.720 --> 02:38.920]  can. You know, that's my favorite thing about you. Uh, you were saying a minute ago that you're
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.440]  trying to get your name in the industry and get your foot in the door basically, and get to be
[02:42.440 --> 02:46.520]  known. I love that you are a humble dude and you're not so worried about getting out there
[02:46.520 --> 02:50.120]  and getting known. You know, that when the time is right for you, it will happen. And you are a
[02:50.120 --> 02:53.400]  ganja soldier. You are a warrior and you're doing it kind of behind the scenes and low key, but
[02:53.400 --> 02:56.520]  you're doing it with a lot of heart and that's what matters. I appreciate it. I don't think
[02:56.520 --> 03:00.680]  yeah. Instagram follows are cool, but I put hard into it. You know what I mean? You're making
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.000]  progress for patients. And that's what it's all about here. I just try to focus on me and doing
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.960]  my thing. And of course my little family, you know, that's, that's the main motivation. You
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.280]  know, I know a lot of people have been affected by cannabis and need cannabis help or, or, or
[03:12.280 --> 03:15.960]  are against it. And I'm just always trying to go push it forward the best way I can, all the love
[03:15.960 --> 03:19.960]  I can. Cause that's the way I was raised. Loving everything you do. There you go. Love grow from
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.440]  your heart. Love everything you do. Awesome. Awesome. So man, I want to thank you. I already
[03:24.440 --> 03:27.640]  thank you for joining me, but I want to thank you for backing me up on Facebook the other day.
[03:28.280 --> 03:32.920]  Sammy and I, uh, I was a member of a Facebook group. I don't know if Sam is, do I call you Sam
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.680]  or Sammy? Whatever you want, man. It doesn't matter. I've been called anything from Jim to
[03:36.680 --> 03:43.000]  Bob. So I'll try to stick with something close to Sam. So, uh, we were, I was in a Facebook group.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.160]  I am no longer a member of that group, but I don't have any issues with that. I was trying,
[03:47.160 --> 03:52.200]  so I don't want to sound like an asshole, but people post the dumbest shit in Facebook groups.
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.960]  They'd be like, I've got spider mites. What do I do? And I'd be like, you should be in your plants
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.040]  and then put baking soda and vinegar on everything. And I'm like, why is that happening?
[04:00.040 --> 04:06.040]  People? Uh, I dunno, no one wants to Google or do anything for themselves beginning, but
[04:06.040 --> 04:09.560]  that's why I get mad. That's why I'm like, why are you asking if what you can do with this?
[04:09.560 --> 04:13.000]  When you know, you can go Google this. It's, this is one-on-one. If you got a one-on-one
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.960]  thing, go Google it. That's my thing. It's probably in a book that says cannabis growing
[04:17.960 --> 04:21.080]  on the front of it. If you just bought a cannabis growing book, you could go to the
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.560]  glossary or the index, look for your problem, find it, turn to that page. You'd find tried
[04:25.560 --> 04:29.240]  and true solutions. Instead, you want to go to Facebook and ask some dude with the clever
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.880]  fucking name who doesn't even have pictures of a grow at questions. And he's like telling you to
[04:33.880 --> 04:37.800]  do the weirdest shit. And so I'll go in there and I'll be like, no, you shouldn't do that.
[04:37.800 --> 04:43.480]  And I will give a factual reason why. And then I will state a positive way to improve
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.640]  your solution so that that way or improve your situation. So that way you're not,
[04:47.640 --> 04:51.320]  because a lot of the things they say will cause you even more problems than you started with.
[04:51.320 --> 04:54.680]  So I'm like, don't do that, do this. And people hate on me. Like you're an asshole,
[04:54.680 --> 04:57.640]  just because you're an expert doesn't mean we can all do that. And I'm like, you can.
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.320]  Yeah. And I think they're afraid of a little bit of work and spending a couple of bucks.
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.320]  They want to make as much as they can off of this crop without putting any energy and money into it.
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.920]  And that day, that's what I remember. That's why I jumped in it because I'll see them going at you,
[05:10.920 --> 05:14.280]  but you can handle your own. I know you know your stuff, but when they attack, like
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.680]  calling you an asshole and all this shit, I can't handle that because just when the best dudes I
[05:18.680 --> 05:23.240]  know, like, I mean, I appreciate that. I met you, you know, whatever we've been friends or whatever.
[05:23.240 --> 05:27.320]  But when I see that happening, I won't allow it. And I'll come in and I'll interject and get your
[05:27.320 --> 05:30.680]  back. And then they'll try to challenge my knowledge. And I'm like, come on, I'm not,
[05:30.680 --> 05:35.240]  I don't know everything, but you're messing with the big dog here. So, you know, I'll let loose.
[05:35.240 --> 05:38.840]  And then I've gotten to it. Yeah. They just don't want to be put in their place. I think that's what
[05:38.840 --> 05:43.480]  it boils down to. They booted me real quick. And then you kept screenshotting me what they were
[05:43.480 --> 05:46.840]  saying, which was rad. You're like, they're trying to say this, bro. But yeah, I appreciate it. You
[05:46.840 --> 05:50.760]  tried to back me up until you're like, you don't, you said something about, you don't even realize
[05:50.760 --> 05:54.600]  the wealth of knowledge you just eliminated from this group. And I appreciate that. That's great.
[05:54.600 --> 05:59.400]  And it's true. A lot of those people, they have no idea what's even happening when I comment.
[05:59.400 --> 06:02.760]  They just look at me like I'm, they call me a know it all and try to talk to me.
[06:02.760 --> 06:06.920]  And I'm like, I'm really trying to help you. Sorry, if I went over your head and I feel like a lot of
[06:06.920 --> 06:12.200]  the problem is ego. I bruise some egos and then, and I don't know it all also. And you know how I
[06:12.200 --> 06:17.240]  did learn? I'll admit a lot of the way I learned things was by fucking things up. Yeah, totally.
[06:17.240 --> 06:20.200]  That's the only way you learn. You're never going to learn unless you try and fail. I've been growing
[06:20.200 --> 06:24.040]  for a long time. So I made a lot of mistakes and I'm willing to admit that. And I'm willing to
[06:24.040 --> 06:29.080]  share my mistakes with people. And they don't even realize that I'm saying I did what you're trying to
[06:29.080 --> 06:33.640]  do and it doesn't work. So, and they just get mad at me. Instead of doing all the trial and error that
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.200]  I did, I'm going to tell you how to get past that. But maybe it's not the nicest because you're not
[06:38.200 --> 06:42.920]  understanding through text, but I'm going to tell you what to do. Not going to lead you astray and
[06:42.920 --> 06:47.400]  like mess your plants up worse just because you listened to me. Yeah. Don't ruin your plants
[06:47.400 --> 06:51.080]  because some dude on Facebook with the cool name taught you to spray something on your plants in
[06:51.080 --> 06:54.440]  week nine, a flower so that you could solve your problem. It's not going to help you out.
[06:55.080 --> 07:00.200]  So honestly, I'm glad that dude, I've got cotton mouth. You have this wicked bad cotton mouth.
[07:00.200 --> 07:05.000]  I do those tabs. Fuck me up. That distillate put my dry face on. I'm not the biggest dabber, but one
[07:05.720 --> 07:11.000]  kind of small dad. I'm yeah. Yeah. I'm feeling it brother. There was another person here. She took a
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.400]  dab and she is now tucked in in bed, probably snoring like a champion. I was looking forward
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.240]  to trying to just distillate cause I never have, but I'm going to wait till after. And once you
[07:19.240 --> 07:22.840]  saw what it did to her, you kind of changed your whole mind. I want to be able to talk to the
[07:22.840 --> 07:27.240]  people, not just laugh at them. Sweet dreams down there. Right. So she's going to listen to
[07:27.240 --> 07:32.040]  this show later and be like, okay, thanks. But I'm kind of glad that those people are failures
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.960]  on the forms and on Facebook groups because it's those groups kind of contributed to me starting
[07:37.960 --> 07:42.440]  this podcast. I was hanging out at Maddie's house late at night and answering grow questions. That's
[07:42.440 --> 07:47.960]  what contributed to it. And there was another podcast I would listen to and people would ask
[07:47.960 --> 07:52.520]  questions and instead they'd be like, I have spider mites. What do I do? And instead of saying,
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.400]  fix the room, find the mites, clean up, and then maybe use a type of product. They would say,
[07:57.400 --> 08:01.240]  oh, go to the store and buy this. You could get this store made by this company. It's only this
[08:01.240 --> 08:05.480]  much. You can get it. This website for this much, tell them that sales, this code, which is my name
[08:08.040 --> 08:11.400]  and you're making a lot of damn money. This isn't even a real email from a real listener.
[08:11.400 --> 08:15.960]  You know what I mean? And I could feel that from a very specific show. And I was like,
[08:15.960 --> 08:21.560]  that's dirty. I don't want to do that to people. So that podcast kind of inspired me to do a show.
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.160]  And then, uh, Tim, Tim Martin had a podcast for a little while there, the JDR, the John Doe radio
[08:27.160 --> 08:32.440]  that inspired this. And then coral, a coral reefer, of course, I wanted to fill the gap that she was
[08:32.440 --> 08:37.720]  missing. She did all the news stuff. I wanted to do the gross stuff. And then, uh, Adam L had a
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.360]  fun podcast with his what? So I'm going to kind of join that vibe. So that's kind of, so all that
[08:42.360 --> 08:45.640]  stupid stuff is what I'm getting at is actually the Facebook group sucking and then all that
[08:45.640 --> 08:49.080]  stuff I wanted to help people out. So that's part of why I started the podcast. So without all those
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.880]  crappy info avenues, this show probably would not have happened. So maybe it's a good thing that
[08:53.880 --> 08:57.880]  those things out there, I guess, bad things always come a good thing. You know? Yeah. Right.
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.880]  Inspiration. That's I mean, why not lead people the right way? You know, in a fun way, instead of
[09:01.880 --> 09:05.880]  making it boring. So I don't want to pay attention. It's so much easier to listen than to read
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.240]  everything. You can absorb this show while you're driving down the highway and you can be on your
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.080]  way to work. You could be in your cubicle with an earbud in, you could be doing whatever you do.
[09:13.080 --> 09:16.680]  Yeah. And listen to a podcast and learn how to grow weed and meet Sammy, the painted chef. I
[09:16.680 --> 09:19.880]  hope you guys are scrolling through his Instagram right now and checking them out. For some reason
[09:19.880 --> 09:25.560]  that feels weird when I say that, but I hope you're doing it. So, uh, let's talk about your
[09:25.560 --> 09:28.680]  growing history and stuff, bro. Let's give you some credibility here on the podcast. I know
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.160]  you're cool as shit, but nobody else here has met you before. Uh, uh, back in the day, uh,
[09:33.160 --> 09:37.240]  I always had my, my mind in it, you know, since I don't know, eighth grade, whenever I first tried
[09:37.240 --> 09:41.560]  marijuana, I always wanted to grow it. And once I was old enough to do my own thing, I started just
[09:41.560 --> 09:46.600]  dabbling with it, playing with it and uh, reading. I read for about 10 years before I ever put a seed
[09:46.600 --> 09:50.280]  in the ground because you know, knowledge is power and whatnot. That's something I encourage
[09:50.280 --> 09:54.840]  read first. And then it just so happened that, uh, I think I joined roll it up or something.
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.080]  One of the old forums that existed back in the day. I discovered sub cool. Cause me and my buddy
[09:59.080 --> 10:02.040]  were looking for a soil recipe. That's how it happened. We were up in Denver, going to start
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.960]  growing, going to get going on it and found that for him, you know, a lot of good knowledge.
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.920]  Very classic. I mean, it's still out there. If anyone wants to check it out, you can learn a lot,
[10:10.920 --> 10:15.560]  but anyway, um, it was that I met a lot of good people through there. I met you. I met all the
[10:15.560 --> 10:20.040]  guys over at geek, uh, geek farms on Oregon. Mike, shout out, Mike, love that guy. And you
[10:20.040 --> 10:23.720]  out there, all those guys, you know, um, the Samson Mallory of all, we're at it. Oh, Raya,
[10:23.720 --> 10:29.160]  or I love, gotta love that guy. Uh, Andrew B that cat's crazy. Um, but I met all those guys,
[10:29.160 --> 10:32.600]  you know, and we just started talking on the forum, you know, having fun. I started learning
[10:32.600 --> 10:36.680]  from them and taking what they taught me, applying it to my plans, trial and error, doing
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.560]  my thing, having fun. I think the first one I grew was a purple cush. I got a clone of, it was my own
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.360]  first tent. Happy. My ex-wife at the time surprised me for a gift, like got me a grow tent. I was like,
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.160]  Oh, what? You're going to let me grow. So I went full bore, you know, and that was fun. Did that.
[10:51.160 --> 10:55.720]  And then, uh, just learn, learn more, learn more. Everything progressed. And I got to where I am
[10:55.720 --> 10:59.960]  started working over at a concentrate products in Denver. Great place to work for. How many
[10:59.960 --> 11:05.320]  lights were you running over there? Oh, it was eight rooms, 75,000 Watts per room. Oh, wow. Okay.
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.120]  Big facility. It was huge. I think it was 2000 plants at all times in there. And, uh, learned a
[11:10.120 --> 11:13.560]  lot, learned a wealth of knowledge over there. I mean, we had so much fun. The guys were good,
[11:13.560 --> 11:17.960]  but you know, I'm not there anymore. Looking to do everything that I can, you know, just progress
[11:17.960 --> 11:22.040]  more. That's pretty much my story in a nutshell. All right. All right. Well, you've got so much
[11:22.040 --> 11:24.680]  heart, bro. That's one thing I love about you. That's one thing I noticed about the cannabis
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.560]  industry. Those people just, we don't stay in the same place for very long. We go in and yeah,
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.520]  I don't mind doing the bounce around because I love seeing the facility and learning as much
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.200]  as I can. And then I'm like, I've, I've kind of, it's like a class, you know what I mean? Like,
[11:38.200 --> 11:41.800]  well, I've made all the friends I want to make here and I've learned as much as I can. I think
[11:41.800 --> 11:46.440]  I'm going to go find another facility to play with. I am now keeps me really happy. I keep,
[11:46.440 --> 11:49.400]  they keep accidentally putting bonuses on my paycheck, so I can't argue with them.
[11:50.280 --> 11:53.240]  I'm just going to stay there. They treat me really well. They're super cool people too.
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.080]  So, yeah, I love it. And you know, we nerds, that's where I learned most of my stuff. That's
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.960]  all the weed nerds, weed nerds everywhere. Every nook and cranny, you know, you can find us always.
[12:02.760 --> 12:07.800]  It's a blast. I had weed nerd stuff wrote down to talk about later, but we can go that way if you
[12:07.800 --> 12:13.000]  want to. So let's introduce the people. Maybe a lot of my listeners aren't familiar because people
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.160]  are listening in Australia and countries I can't even pronounce. I make that mistake a lot to
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.320]  assume everyone knows who and what the weed nerds are. Yeah. So there is a guy, a group of people,
[12:21.320 --> 12:25.640]  but mainly it's led by the ringleader is a dude by the name of sub cool.
[12:26.520 --> 12:29.640]  And he's on Instagram, but they keep deleting him. So I'm not sure.
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.600]  It's I think it's sub cool for 20 now. Okay. I believe that's what it is, but I'm not a hundred
[12:34.600 --> 12:37.880]  percent sure. Yeah. By the time this episode comes out, they will have deleted him. Right.
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.920]  He will have a new account. But so his name is sub cool and he runs a seed company called TGA
[12:42.920 --> 12:50.520]  sub cool seeds. TGA stands for the green Avenger. They are known for strains like space queen and
[12:50.520 --> 12:57.080]  vortex and Jilly Bean Jilly Bean. Actually, let's talk about another member of TGA. Miss Jill
[12:57.640 --> 13:04.040]  MZ period. Jill made a strain called Jilly Bean. It's not jelly. It's Jilly because it's named
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.840]  after Miss Jill. That is sub cools wife. She's a badass grower. She's a cool lady. She does some
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.920]  breeding. She made the Brian Berry cough. So that is part of the the TGA sub cool family. There's
[13:14.920 --> 13:20.200]  also Jinx proof who made the nine pound hammer. Jinx. He's a he's a crazy cat, but I like watching
[13:20.440 --> 13:24.520]  him grow up. Blow his glass over there on. Yeah, he's a really cool dude. I love his be positive
[13:24.520 --> 13:29.640]  attitude. He's got a child with autism and he also suffers from a seizure condition. So his
[13:29.640 --> 13:34.440]  be positive attitude is just really cool to see him use cannabis in a positive way and educate
[13:34.440 --> 13:38.200]  everybody. And yeah, so shout out to the whole weird crew. But that's who we're talking about
[13:38.200 --> 13:44.440]  is sub cool is the ringleader of the weed nerds. He is the leader of the TGA sub cool seed company.
[13:44.440 --> 13:48.840]  They've also got a side company known as natural homegrown wonders, which are some of sub cools
[13:48.840 --> 13:55.560]  best friends. But the weed nerds are so he does a show on YouTube called the weed nerd and you can
[13:55.560 --> 13:59.880]  watch him. He does a little headbanging. He does a little ganja teaching. He'll speak his mind
[13:59.880 --> 14:05.080]  totally. It's so I better give him some credit. He kind of inspired this podcast to on accident,
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.320]  I think without me even realizing it, because it's the same damn format now that I think about it
[14:09.320 --> 14:14.520]  without sub, I wouldn't be growing. I wouldn't be where I am for sure. My photography, you could
[14:14.520 --> 14:21.080]  tell that he made photography what it is. Yeah. Him and Nug buckets, Nug buckets. That's okay. Oh,
[14:21.080 --> 14:28.120]  man. Nugs takes the pictures. There's another guy, uh, freebie and TC, TC, TC Curtis. Yes. And
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.440]  Mr. Spliff. Yeah. A bunch of, a bunch of great cannabis photographers, but so subs got a show
[14:32.440 --> 14:36.680]  called the weed nerd. And then all of the folks that follow the show and are on the show are
[14:36.680 --> 14:41.640]  considered weed nerds and there's a weed nerd nation. And it's a big, it's a big group of
[14:41.720 --> 14:47.160]  folks that have heart about cannabis that love to grow and breed and support cannabis. And it's,
[14:47.160 --> 14:52.520]  it's a bunch of weed nerds is basically what it is. So I endorse you to go, uh, encourage you.
[14:52.520 --> 14:56.360]  I said endorse, but I encourage you. I'm high as shit to tell you the truth. I encourage you to go
[14:56.360 --> 15:01.160]  check out some weed nerd stuff, check out some sub cool stuff. A lot of people have a lot of, uh,
[15:01.160 --> 15:06.840]  opinions about sub cool and his products, but go see for yourself. That's, that's what I think.
[15:06.840 --> 15:10.520]  Exactly. I mean, people have opinions about people, but if your attitude doesn't match
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.520]  with someone else's look past that and look to what they're bringing, look to their message and
[15:14.520 --> 15:19.800]  you can learn a lot more. A lot of people probably don't realize how many strains sub cool has
[15:19.800 --> 15:25.240]  brought to market that are amazing strains. Plush Berry was a sub cool creation. The original,
[15:25.240 --> 15:28.440]  they're bringing her back, but there's, there's some stuff there, but yeah, plush berries. I saw
[15:28.440 --> 15:32.600]  Ms. Jill was making a bunch of plush Berry seeds recently. Yeah. I loved, I've bred with plush
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.560]  Berry. I had a really cool purple, a purple phenotype. I've seen that. That's what made the
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.440]  black cherry Kim. Yeah, that's some fire right there. And we'll get onto that later, but yeah,
[15:43.320 --> 15:47.640]  that Jilly bean too. Uh, so, uh, we've been talking on Facebook a little bit
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.080]  and you actually wanted to talk a little bit about led growing.
[15:51.720 --> 15:57.800]  Yeah. Yeah. Um, led growing is I use it for veg when I'm got a full thing going. I use it because
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.200]  of course it saves power and if you know how to use them, you can use them right. You know,
[16:02.200 --> 16:06.040]  I know a lot of people who like to put them down real close to the plant because they think the
[16:06.040 --> 16:11.160]  closer the better, but there's actually a opportune, I guess you want to say range there.
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.920]  I think it's 18 to 12 or 18 to 24 inches away from your plant. They're beams focused and you
[16:16.920 --> 16:20.520]  can actually tell when you're adjusting your light. If you look at the shadow, the way the
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.320]  color split, that's what I found. That's when once you do that, they just take off. I know.
[16:25.320 --> 16:28.920]  I found that's actually right with just about every light you have to find that I'll call it
[16:28.920 --> 16:33.000]  the sweet spot. You know, like when you get too close, you can probably tell yourself when you
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.680]  get too close, it's real hot. When you start backing off a little bit, you could tell, Ooh,
[16:36.680 --> 16:39.160]  that's not too hot. I can handle it. And then if you go a little further, you're like, Oh,
[16:39.160 --> 16:42.920]  there's not a lot of light on my hand. Your plants can tell the same damn thing and they
[16:42.920 --> 16:46.760]  want that sweet spot. So you got to find that with an led and you say it's 18 to 24 inches.
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.280]  I believe that's what it is. It's been a minute. I've been out of my own growth for a while. Cause
[16:50.280 --> 16:54.520]  I've been bouncing around, but I believe that's what it is. Okay. A lot of other things. That
[16:54.520 --> 16:58.280]  looks right to me from what I see in all the pictures. A lot of people don't realize that
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.480]  the lenses have a different angle. I think there's like 60, 90 and 120. The way the beam
[17:03.480 --> 17:07.400]  shoots out of the lens. And yeah, that's true. The nineties will shoot them straight down. That's
[17:07.400 --> 17:11.080]  what I kind of want. That's what I look for. I go for a 90. So I know all that light is just
[17:11.080 --> 17:16.040]  going straight to the plant. And then if you can take that into account and get what you're going,
[17:16.040 --> 17:20.040]  you can do a lot of good with your leds. I think a lot of people are either afraid or mad because
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.960]  they don't understand how to really roll with the led. Cause they, they bought one for $25 off eBay,
[17:25.960 --> 17:29.080]  put it two inches from their plant and their plant did nothing but give them some, a little
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.280]  bit of frost, you know? Yeah. So, I mean, people are afraid to try it. I say, do it. Okay. I say,
[17:34.280 --> 17:37.880]  go with it. Go for it. The new way, the new plants, the lights they have coming out are
[17:37.880 --> 17:42.440]  doing some good things. I mean, I'm not Mr. In the led light industry, but right.
[17:42.440 --> 17:46.040]  Is there a brand that you've had good experience with or a brand that you would recommend to buy?
[17:46.760 --> 17:50.760]  Off the top of my head, I wouldn't want to just ramble off and get them. I respect that more than
[17:50.760 --> 17:55.560]  you trying to spit something out. I would rather not answer that. Make people mad.
[17:56.440 --> 18:01.080]  Plead the fifth is always the best bet. There you go. You said ex-wife earlier, you're getting smart.
[18:03.080 --> 18:07.640]  Never miss an opportunity to keep your mouth shut. Right? There you go. All right. So what,
[18:08.280 --> 18:11.560]  is there anything major I'm going to have to do other than finding that sweet spot and the
[18:11.560 --> 18:15.160]  major difference between growing from an HID, like a high pressure sodium?
[18:15.160 --> 18:15.880]  Watering.
[18:15.880 --> 18:17.320]  Watering is going to be different. Okay.
[18:17.320 --> 18:20.680]  Because they don't use as much. It's not as hot in the room, so it doesn't evaporate as much.
[18:20.680 --> 18:21.000]  Okay.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.680]  You just got to watch that. I've done it myself. Got some fungus gnats,
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.040]  kicked myself in the ass a couple of times.
[18:26.040 --> 18:27.000]  Those damn fungus gnats.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.480]  You just got to watch them. You know, got to watch your watering. You got to,
[18:30.360 --> 18:35.480]  let me see. What else did I adjust from doing that to that? I guess he was undercut a little more
[18:35.480 --> 18:35.880]  because-
[18:35.880 --> 18:39.640]  Clean up the bottom because you're not getting the penetration. Okay. So a little, what we mean is
[18:39.640 --> 18:43.480]  clean up the underskirt. There's leaves on the bottom of the plant that aren't really necessary.
[18:43.480 --> 18:46.760]  Just little shitty growth. You guys will know what I'm talking about. It's a little tiny,
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.800]  just crappy veg growth. That's not going to turn into anything. You're going to have to trim
[18:49.800 --> 18:54.360]  fluffy stuff. Cut that off of there. The energy where that was being wasted will now go up to the
[18:54.360 --> 18:58.280]  top. You'll get a fatter, chunkier bud up at the top of the plant. So clean up that underside.
[18:59.320 --> 19:02.680]  Sorry, excuse me for clearing the throat. You're going to have to clean up the underside a little
[19:02.680 --> 19:06.600]  bit more. Maybe pull the plants out a little bit more and spread them so you can get more light to
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.040]  them. Do a little bit more pruning probably, like defoliate a little bit. And then water a little
[19:12.040 --> 19:16.440]  bit less frequently. Are you going to have to change your feeding other than the amount of
[19:16.440 --> 19:19.160]  water you're going to have to change your feed regimen? I've always just kept it the same.
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.320]  Okay. Just a little bit lighter. All right. Because I go from LED straight to under HID.
[19:23.320 --> 19:26.840]  Oh, you throw them right under that. Okay. I don't keep it that way. I'm kind of rough on them,
[19:26.840 --> 19:30.280]  but hey, they're- They like it. They like it rough. I think treating them a little bit rough.
[19:31.080 --> 19:33.800]  The plants, they're meant to be outside. They grow- Yeah.
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.120]  I've said it before. They grow on a rock, like Afghan plants. In Afghanistan, they'd grow on a
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.280]  rocky mountainside where the wind would blow on it and the sun would beat on it and it'd get
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.280]  rained on and a goat would piss on it. These plants are meant to be durable. You know what I mean?
[19:46.280 --> 19:48.360]  They're not sissy plants. Hearty, hearty plants. Some of the
[19:48.360 --> 19:51.320]  strongest plants there are around. Yeah. They call it weed for a reason,
[19:51.320 --> 19:52.920]  is what Mike always says. It'll grow anywhere.
[19:52.920 --> 19:56.840]  Anywhere. If you're doing it, you can- Even if you have to try it almost, kill this plant.
[19:56.840 --> 19:59.240]  It's something that I've learned. Yeah, totally. You have to put it through
[19:59.240 --> 20:03.480]  some stuff. I mean, it may spit out some seeds you don't want it, but it's still going to survive
[20:03.480 --> 20:07.880]  through all the stress you give it. Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. So you're dragging it right from the
[20:07.880 --> 20:13.000]  LEDs under the HIDs. Is it going to get straight? Does it grow more stretchy or does it stay
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.680]  bushier with the LEDs? It'll start to compact more and get a little bit more bushy.
[20:16.680 --> 20:20.520]  That's a good thing. That's why I like it. I'll give it a couple of weeks of a little bit more
[20:20.520 --> 20:25.880]  veg under the LED before, I mean, the HID before I flip it and put it in the flower, just to get
[20:25.880 --> 20:29.000]  them a little bit more used to the light. Do you notice a stretch? Does it stretch at
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.640]  that point? It stretches. I don't know. Maybe. It depends on what I'm doing. I try to keep them
[20:33.640 --> 20:37.240]  real small. What size spots are you using? Just out of curiosity now.
[20:37.320 --> 20:42.440]  Little one gallons inside a six by six, a three by three by six. Just a little sleeve of green.
[20:42.440 --> 20:45.800]  Yeah. I love that. I love those little tiny sets like that with little pots. I'm actually
[20:45.800 --> 20:51.160]  running a pheno hunt on, excuse me, I keep burping. I keep drinking Dr. Pepper to try to get rid of the
[20:51.160 --> 20:55.000]  dab throat here. And it's making a terrible combo of burps and throat clearing. I apologize.
[20:55.720 --> 20:59.240]  I'm doing a pheno hunt in solo cups and I've just got them in a little tray so that I can
[20:59.240 --> 21:03.240]  water the tray and it absorbs the water, but it's working pretty well. I've never done it like that,
[21:03.240 --> 21:08.440]  but you can fit, uh, you can fit 28 cups in one of these trays. And then I eliminated close to
[21:08.440 --> 21:11.960]  half of them because they're male and female. You know, I pulled the boys out. So there's like 14 or
[21:11.960 --> 21:16.680]  15 males per tray and they fit beautifully in there. And I just pour water in the tray, but
[21:16.680 --> 21:20.200]  I just got them in solo cups and I love a tiny girl like that. Everybody, every day, once in a
[21:20.200 --> 21:23.800]  while, I like, I like to do a solo cup challenge when I was on the forums. That's always fun. Get
[21:23.800 --> 21:28.840]  a bunch of people going a whole plant in a solo cup. Yeah. You can do. Yeah. But maybe depending
[21:28.840 --> 21:32.680]  on how long I let them go to three inches, they'll stretch real nice, real quick for me. And then
[21:32.680 --> 21:37.720]  I'll flip them. All right. It's more of, I guess it's more of a, a height thing for me than a time
[21:37.720 --> 21:41.880]  thing. I've never put anything on a timer or anything. That's kind of how I try to have a
[21:41.880 --> 21:47.000]  height schedule, but I just broke my schedule by seven by five days, a couple of days ago, because
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.760]  like these plants are too tall. I just, I walked in there and I was like, no, these must go into
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.360]  flower. Now the grower in me kicked in. I was like, forget a schedule. These plants have to
[21:54.360 --> 21:59.640]  flower. I guess I turned into Ari Shafir in my head. I just realized, but I was like, I got to
[21:59.640 --> 22:03.320]  flower these plants. I never, I just listened to the plant. That's all I've ever done. I mean,
[22:03.320 --> 22:06.680]  our schedules are fine for a good little rule of thumb, but the plant will tell you what it
[22:06.680 --> 22:11.400]  needs, what it wants to do. Yeah. Can't can't do what it doesn't want to do. So yeah. Force it.
[22:11.400 --> 22:14.360]  You can't, you can force it to flower. That's about the only thing you can force it to do.
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.560]  You can thank God for that. I've learned, I've learned to force it to do some shit. I've forced
[22:17.560 --> 22:21.640]  girls into boys, but anyway, that's a different story. Speaking of, I just dragged plants into
[22:21.640 --> 22:25.960]  flower. You guys, just to give you kind of an update on some new shit I'm trying. I recently
[22:25.960 --> 22:31.320]  purchased the entire setup of veg bloom. I got the base nudes. I got the life, I got the shine
[22:31.320 --> 22:37.400]  and I got the push foliar spray and I just put some grateful dog plants into flower and they
[22:37.400 --> 22:43.480]  are getting fed the full veg bloom plus a little bit of aminos from photosynthesis plus, plus
[22:43.480 --> 22:48.760]  occasionally they're getting a little bit of humble honey is what they're getting fed for
[22:48.760 --> 22:53.480]  carbohydrates and that yucca extract just to give them a little, a little moisture, a little fluff,
[22:53.480 --> 22:58.840]  a little taste. Yeah. So yeah. They just went into flower a few days ago. So in like nine weeks,
[22:58.840 --> 23:03.880]  I'll let you know. That was my first memory of use that grateful dog. Oh yeah. That's such a
[23:03.880 --> 23:09.160]  great strain. I think that's one of my top five of all time probably. And really, wow. I just love
[23:09.160 --> 23:12.760]  that strain. So I'm going to put you on the spot. Top five. I'm going to, I'm going to write grateful
[23:12.760 --> 23:17.480]  dog on here as number five. I'm not going to put myself as one. Top five is going to be that one.
[23:17.480 --> 23:23.000]  I'm going to have to say the blue Jay was good. I really loved the blue. Do you remember what that
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.320]  crosses from geek Mike? He sent it to me. It was a Jilly bean. The marmalade Fino cross with Oregon
[23:29.320 --> 23:34.920]  blues. Oh, Oregon blues. Yeah, sir. Let me see. And then Durbin Durbin's always one of my favorite.
[23:34.920 --> 23:40.680]  Okay. I love me a good Durbin critical mass. That's one of my most recent favorites. Okay.
[23:40.680 --> 23:47.160]  Is that five? If we did critical mass Durbin poison, Oregon blues, the blue one that I can't
[23:47.160 --> 23:50.920]  read the next word from and the grateful dog, but you can keep going. What else you got on there?
[23:51.880 --> 23:55.880]  Dr. Who? I love me some doctor. Yeah, I know you do. That's why I had to remind you nine pound
[23:55.880 --> 24:00.760]  hammer. Yeah. So it was Dr. Who from jinx proof. No doctor. Who was from Odie Odie.
[24:00.760 --> 24:05.080]  Nice. Shout out to Odie diesel. Those Oregon boys. All those homegrown natural wonders guys. Yeah.
[24:05.080 --> 24:08.120]  Got to check them out. Check them out on Instagram. They do some great stuff.
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.920]  And then let me see a agent orange. I had a really good taste of Asian orange back in the day. I
[24:12.920 --> 24:16.520]  don't know if you remember him. Cannabis, cannabis, Colt or cannabis get whichever one his name
[24:16.600 --> 24:21.320]  sounds familiar. Yeah. Yeah. I, he lived up in the mountains here in Colorado and I went to see him
[24:21.320 --> 24:25.640]  one time. He gave me some tasty, tasty agent orange. Like it tastes like I bit of Valencia.
[24:25.640 --> 24:31.000]  It was, it was amazing. Yeah. That's that, uh, that orange velvet clone that Ms. Jill has.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  Yeah. I miss that cat. He was a good cat. He kind of disappeared, but you know, sometimes we got to
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.320]  disappear in the mountains or whatever, but then let me see a lot of the old school growers from
[24:39.320 --> 24:44.760]  like overgrow and from that generation, they all just disappeared. Like they had to, there was just,
[24:44.760 --> 24:50.120]  you know, people might take off too much, too quick is what happened. Yeah. Let me see another
[24:50.120 --> 24:56.200]  one that just knocked my socks off. Uh, I don't know. Grateful dogs. I'll have tried of yours.
[24:56.200 --> 25:00.680]  So I can't. Okay. Well we might fix that before you leave here. I would not be upset. Yeah. Um,
[25:00.680 --> 25:05.480]  but yeah. What's your favorite strain to grow, to grow, uh, to date my favorite one to grow would
[25:05.480 --> 25:11.880]  probably be the, um, the, the blue J the blue J was a fun one to go. I haven't grown it in a minute,
[25:11.880 --> 25:15.960]  but it was easy. It was, it was fun to play with. The buzzer, nice and pretty. It's so tasty.
[25:15.960 --> 25:18.680]  There's something about an easy strain. You know what I mean? When you're saying, Oh,
[25:18.680 --> 25:22.920]  an easy grow another one recently, river song. That's what I've been trying to get out of my
[25:22.920 --> 25:26.520]  head. River song. Put that one on there. Cause the river song is amazing. What's the cross on
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.800]  there? River song was, Oh, what was it? It's a riot out of a ride love out of Oregon. It was,
[25:32.600 --> 25:37.720]  what was it? Oregon blues. I'll have to think about it and get back here. I love that Oregon
[25:37.720 --> 25:41.720]  blues out there. Yeah. I want to taste that. That's what I want to get ahold of. But yeah,
[25:41.720 --> 25:46.360]  that's what they're working on. When Nug buckets is working on one with that river song called
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.680]  crooked city blues or something. It's the river song crossed with, um, Oh shit. Now I'm going to
[25:52.680 --> 25:55.560]  draw a blank. And I've been thinking about it. It'll come to you. We'll talk about something
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.280]  different. You'll, you'll be like, Oh bro. It's totally acceptable to check out that stuff coming
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.680]  out of Oregon. They got it all up there. It's so much fun to play with. So, uh, you reminded me
[26:04.680 --> 26:10.200]  when you got here that I gave you your very first dad, sir, man, you're welcome. I'm honored.
[26:10.200 --> 26:14.280]  Dude. I, I, that was like when everything was first starting to get going with the dabs and
[26:14.280 --> 26:20.520]  everything and you know, the butane and everything, my lungs, whatever, but just there, give me a dab.
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.440]  I'm going to take a dab. And yeah, that, that day we, that was like our second time meeting.
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.160]  Were we in line for the cannabis cup and I gave you a dab in the line, right? People were smoking
[26:29.160 --> 26:32.920]  joints and I was like, well, let's get down. I remember there were people like from Florida
[26:32.920 --> 26:36.600]  around us and we were just doing dabs and everyone's eyes were like, whoa, people did
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.680]  not know what to think of the guy with dreadlocks giving dabs to his friends. I thought it was pretty
[26:40.680 --> 26:44.360]  red. Yeah. Well, you know, I wasn't going to be like that about it. You're, you're a person over
[26:44.360 --> 26:51.400]  here taking dabs with me. Yeah. Yeah. That was, yeah, that was a fun time. I had fun all day.
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.960]  You know, all day. He had fun. Just held around. I guess you would call it. Yeah. You helped me
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.000]  out with something on that day. I'm not going to call you out on air on the podcast. Cause I,
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.120]  yeah, but you helped me out. Thank you. That was right. I appreciated that. I had to help you out.
[27:02.200 --> 27:08.520]  That was smooth. I could have sit there and watch you just know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sammy saw a door
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.720]  that was open and helped me walk through it. Probably saved me like a good hour and a half
[27:13.720 --> 27:18.120]  in line. At least do that line was not cool, man. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun to go to stuff like that,
[27:18.120 --> 27:23.240]  but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Standing in line sometimes for a cannabis event in the hot sun. Oh yeah.
[27:23.240 --> 27:27.080]  Cause you're driving nuts and you paid a lot of money to get into that place and you got to just
[27:27.080 --> 27:32.200]  stand outside all day because they're not prepared. Yeah. Do you have any predictions
[27:32.200 --> 27:38.440]  or have you heard any news for the cannabis cup in Denver or Colorado or anything for this year?
[27:38.440 --> 27:42.920]  After last year, all that fiasco, I don't know. I'm just kind of over it. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.080]  of how I've been too. I'd like to usually by this time of year, I start getting prepared. I start
[27:47.080 --> 27:51.080]  getting seeds on deck and packaged up and having some ideas and knowing what I'm going to do and
[27:51.080 --> 27:55.880]  start looking at hotels. Uh, this is honestly the first conversation or thought I've put into it
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.360]  so far. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Honestly, it's, I don't know. After that first year that I went,
[28:00.360 --> 28:03.880]  it was kind of like, that was fun. I did my thing, you know, let me get back to my family.
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.160]  Yeah. There you go. High times. What's going on? Anybody out there? What's going on for the
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.640]  cannabis cup this year? No, Colorado misses you. I guess. Watch. I'm going to throw in a shameless
[28:11.640 --> 28:15.800]  advertisement because I have to do an advertisement in this podcast and I didn't do it, but I missed
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.480]  the podcast because I don't get to see my friends from handmade apparel. I said the podcast, damn,
[28:19.480 --> 28:22.920]  I tried to be smooth about it. I missed the cannabis cup because I don't get to see my
[28:22.920 --> 28:27.400]  friends from handmade apparel. Oh, I love those guys. Those guys are so cool. Right? Adam. Yeah.
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.760]  Adam is cool. And Jackie's cool as shit. It's cool. The whole crew that they bring. And then
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.200]  what's cool is they bring the oil slick crew with them because they're all friends. And then you get
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.040]  the oil slick crew and the handmade crew together. And then it's just, yeah, we all get goofy and
[28:40.040 --> 28:44.360]  take a bunch of dads and high five and their shirts. Their shirts are amazing. I love them.
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.520]  The I'm not wearing it for a change. I'm usually wearing an Irie genetics or a hoodie or to grow
[28:48.520 --> 28:52.440]  from your heart hoodie or something, but their printing is so perfect. Oh yeah. People don't
[28:52.440 --> 28:56.840]  want to print. I've had graphic artists turn me down to print my stuff because it's too many colors
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.360]  and it's too much. They're like, it's going to cost like 20 bucks a shirt. And I'm like, nope,
[29:00.360 --> 29:04.040]  but handmade apparel does them very affordably. So that's what I'm getting at. You guys support
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.600]  my friends at handmade apparel, check out handmade apparel.biz. I'll get some shirts.
[29:08.600 --> 29:12.920]  They will make t-shirts hoodies. They will print whatever you need printed. They are amazing. They
[29:12.920 --> 29:16.920]  do the art in house. Adam's an amazing artist. They can make hat pins. They'll make stickers.
[29:16.920 --> 29:20.440]  They will do it all. Go get some stuff made from them. Tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you,
[29:20.440 --> 29:23.720]  let them know that you're listening to the grow from your heart podcast. They're running a super
[29:23.720 --> 29:26.680]  great special right now. I don't want to quote prices because it may change by the time you
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.320]  listen to this episode, but please check them out. Much love, much respect to the handmade apparel
[29:31.320 --> 29:35.560]  crew and the oil sector. I love you guys out there on the coast. Miss you guys. Hope everything is
[29:35.560 --> 29:39.400]  well. Definitely do yourself a favor with those guys. If you need shirts, they're the place to go.
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.160]  Yeah. They print the, uh, all the industry shirts. That's where sub cool gets his shirts done. It's
[29:43.160 --> 29:46.680]  where I get all my shirts done. I've got the grow from your heart hoodies. They're sitting in a box
[29:46.760 --> 29:51.880]  over there behind you. The print on those things is so bold, bro. It's so fresh. They look so good.
[29:51.880 --> 29:57.160]  It's kind of weird. We're in a hoodie with my face on my back, but I can imagine that, but Hey,
[29:57.160 --> 30:00.840]  you know, that's how life goes. You got, you got a hoodie with your face on your back. Yeah. Not a
[30:00.840 --> 30:05.080]  lot of people have a hoodie with their show. I don't shoot, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.
[30:05.080 --> 30:09.160]  Yeah. Yeah. We might, you might, by the time you leave here, you might have a hoodie with my face
[30:09.160 --> 30:13.240]  on your back and then you might have some I region that ex flowers in your lung. We'll see how it
[30:13.240 --> 30:16.760]  goes. Like I said, I wouldn't be upset. Right. Right. We're trying to make everybody happy here,
[30:17.640 --> 30:21.640]  man. You know what I've noticed? And I'm trying to make it sound organic, but I did write this down.
[30:21.640 --> 30:28.840]  Uh, chefs, bro. Chefs are always good. Not always, but a lot of good growers and breeders are also
[30:28.840 --> 30:33.000]  good chefs. And I know you're the painted chef and I've, I've made comments on Facebook. One time I
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.240]  said I burned myself and he told me to rub mustard on it. Oh yeah. Yeah. You were like, rub mustard
[30:37.240 --> 30:40.920]  on it, bro. You'll be fine. I didn't do that. Cause I didn't, all I had was that French's crap.
[30:40.920 --> 30:44.840]  And that's not mustard. The yellow. Yeah. That's what you're supposed to use. Oh, is that mustard?
[30:44.840 --> 30:48.680]  Is that really mustard? That French is what it basically is. It holds vinegar on it and the
[30:48.680 --> 30:52.360]  vinegar will kill the swelling and all that. So that's, I learned that from my grandma.
[30:52.360 --> 30:57.400]  That's an old grandma. Shout out to grandma. Rest in peace. Grandma. Yeah. My grandma too.
[30:57.400 --> 31:01.560]  They're probably up there cooking together, sharing recipes. Uh, okay. Uh, talking about
[31:01.560 --> 31:04.840]  chefs being good growers is where I was. Jeez. I threw myself way off talking about our grandmas.
[31:04.840 --> 31:10.680]  That was weird. Um, ramble, ramble. Yeah. They like it when we grandma ramble. Yes, sir. So
[31:10.680 --> 31:14.520]  chefs are good growers and breeders. Do you think there's anything about that? Is that the flavor
[31:14.520 --> 31:19.320]  or is that the work ethic? Probably all of it. And attention to detail, attention to detail. I'm glad
[31:19.320 --> 31:23.000]  you said that. Cause I made some notes and that wasn't one of the things I wrote. Yeah. I mean,
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.560]  if you're, well, if you're a chef, I'm not going to get on that whole kit cause the cooking a chef
[31:27.560 --> 31:31.400]  are two things, but if you got to put plates together, you got to get down into it and get
[31:31.400 --> 31:34.600]  everything together and get the good flavors coming out. You got to pay attention to every
[31:34.600 --> 31:39.000]  detail, every detail, everything has to look at every tomato when you slice it and make sure it's
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.560]  not a little bit mushy or a little too hard. I was the chef that cuisine for a five star
[31:43.560 --> 31:47.880]  establishment at one point. You know, that's why I call myself a chef. Cause I was a chef, but, um,
[31:48.680 --> 31:52.520]  it was fun. They gave me my whole kitchen to run. I was in charge of everything, but it was
[31:52.520 --> 31:56.760]  my artwork on a plate. So that detail had to be there. Someone didn't do it right.
[31:57.400 --> 32:01.080]  Watch out. Cause here comes Sam, you know, you know, that's just how it is. You know,
[32:01.080 --> 32:04.280]  you gotta be a perfectionist. You gotta do that. And that just transfers over to the world of
[32:04.280 --> 32:07.880]  growing super simple. And it's easier in a grow because you don't have a time limit to do it.
[32:07.880 --> 32:12.600]  You don't, I gotta get this plate out in this amount of time. Right. So I think chefs can make
[32:12.600 --> 32:16.280]  the adjustment better and be better at this cause it's less stress. And if it's the same amount of
[32:16.280 --> 32:19.960]  work and the same amount of fun, if you're that kind of crazy, Yeah, yeah. That kind of crazy.
[32:19.960 --> 32:24.040]  I like that because you're right. All of the chefs I've worked with several, several chefs
[32:24.040 --> 32:28.840]  in the cannabis industry. And I have several chef friends, everybody that works in a kitchen,
[32:28.840 --> 32:33.320]  loves to consume some cannabis before during and or after work. So I am associated with a lot of
[32:33.320 --> 32:37.800]  people in a kitchen environment. They're all that special kind of crazy. Yes. They can work a 12
[32:37.800 --> 32:41.880]  hour shift and then drink for eight hours right after work and then sleep for like four hours and
[32:41.880 --> 32:45.640]  be back at it tomorrow. And I'm like, how in the hell do you guys do that? It's hot in there.
[32:45.640 --> 32:48.840]  When you're, when you're outside the kitchen with a chef, you'll hear him saying, I hate the
[32:48.840 --> 32:53.560]  kitchen, but you get them in that kitchen, get, get that pressure going. And every chef loves that.
[32:54.280 --> 32:58.360]  There's something about that pressure. I love working. I'm not, I've, I am no good in a kitchen.
[32:58.600 --> 33:01.640]  I would know the first thing I'm lost in a kitchen. You'd throw me the hell out. I'd cut
[33:01.640 --> 33:06.600]  myself. It'd be over quickly, but I love pressure. I like to work under pressure. I noticed myself,
[33:06.600 --> 33:10.440]  the guys at work, look at me like you should probably slow down. Cause we're going to be
[33:10.440 --> 33:14.120]  out of work by noon. If you keep going that fast, I don't know any other speed and turbo
[33:14.120 --> 33:17.720]  just yet. Turbo is the way to go. It's so much fun getting work done. And then you look back
[33:17.720 --> 33:21.800]  and you're like, who's all this shit I just got done. You're covered in sweat and your back hurts,
[33:21.800 --> 33:25.160]  but you're like, yeah. And all the other guys are trying to catch up. And you're like, I've got,
[33:25.160 --> 33:27.800]  I'm not done an hour early. I'm going to take dabs and hang out with my family.
[33:28.520 --> 33:33.400]  Like they're still, they're trying to puddle buckets into five tables back. Yeah. Five tables
[33:33.400 --> 33:37.560]  behind you. So yeah, I think, I think chefs make great growers and breeders that work ethic,
[33:37.560 --> 33:41.160]  that attention to detail. I was going to say the cleanliness, dude. I mean, you can't do anything
[33:41.160 --> 33:44.600]  with that. Okay. You can, but you don't want to eat at those restaurants. Yeah, yeah, no,
[33:44.600 --> 33:47.560]  I've gotten sick from a non-clean restaurant before. I don't want to do that again. It's
[33:47.560 --> 33:51.640]  hard for me to eat out. I'm sure. And it's not because of the cleanliness. Yeah. But it's mainly
[33:51.640 --> 33:56.520]  because the way presentation happens and stuff, if it's not perfect, I'm pretty mad. My, my,
[33:56.520 --> 34:01.720]  my daughters are always like, dad, don't know. Don't see my face change. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But
[34:01.720 --> 34:05.160]  you know, you do what you can. Right. It's the hardest thing just to keep your mouth shut and
[34:05.160 --> 34:08.680]  not let that eyeball challenge. You're like, Oh God, I want to say something. Their food's messed
[34:08.680 --> 34:13.320]  up. Oh, I will get in the manager because those are my girls, you know? I don't know. That's just
[34:13.320 --> 34:17.560]  me, but it's good. You got to protect the ladies like that. Yeah. No, I'll just, I'm, I guess I'm
[34:17.560 --> 34:21.320]  different. I just silently eat it and get up and leave. I'm like, man, thanks for that shitty food.
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.600]  I'm not coming back. I used to be like that until I got deep into my chef, you know, and it's like,
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.200]  I know what it takes to do that. And if I can do that, you guys should be right here in there.
[34:30.200 --> 34:36.040]  It's already at almost any restaurant where we live around here. It's all like pre prepared.
[34:36.040 --> 34:39.480]  You know what I mean? At most restaurants now it's all pre prepped. They just got to go in there and
[34:39.480 --> 34:43.560]  pour the bags into the thing and put the right sauce on top of it and bring it out. You know,
[34:43.560 --> 34:47.160]  like you couldn't even put the three bags together and heat them up properly for me.
[34:47.160 --> 34:51.720]  Come on, man. You cooked on this was the Patty. Yeah. Yeah. I went to a, I'm not going to call
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.680]  out the restaurant, but I went to a restaurant that they get rave reviews on the internet and
[34:56.680 --> 35:01.160]  they are decorated up like they're fancy bro. And they act like they're real fancy. They,
[35:01.160 --> 35:06.600]  they kind of gave that one person in there gave me like a, Oh, sort of a look when I came in.
[35:06.600 --> 35:10.200]  Of course I'm six, five and I have dreadlocks to my ass. And I was walking through a fancy
[35:10.200 --> 35:13.160]  restaurant. I get, I get the look. I had my dreads tied up, but they could still,
[35:13.160 --> 35:16.440]  they still looked at me like, Whoa. And I had bright red eyes because I just took in a,
[35:16.440 --> 35:23.000]  taking a dab in the car, but they served us a, what are they called? Raviolis as an appetizer.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.560]  But the plate came with a, I don't know what it was. It was a light colored sauce with a
[35:27.560 --> 35:31.480]  dark colored swirl. And it was real fancy looking. I just smacked the microphone, making a swirl.
[35:31.480 --> 35:35.640]  Um, and then it had the Raviolis on top of that. And there was a little side of marinara and a side
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.720]  of another sauce. And then they'd put like fresh Parmesan or something on top of it. And I was
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.640]  like, that looks fucking delicious. I'm going to grab me one of them. I took a bite out of it.
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.680]  And I'm 95% sure that is the same frozen Ravioli that I bought at Sam's club that I have in my
[35:48.680 --> 35:54.440]  freezer over there. And I felt embarrassed for myself for getting excited. Like, Oh, that's a
[35:54.440 --> 35:58.520]  fucking, you were fooled. I could have made that at home. Yeah. And then I felt bad for the whole
[35:58.520 --> 36:03.400]  restaurant. I was like, Oh wait, they just lost all credibility to me. I was like, what?
[36:04.920 --> 36:08.360]  It's an industry wide thing. And that, you know, it sucks because people are going out there
[36:08.360 --> 36:11.720]  thinking they're going to get this great meal when you can go to Walmart and pick it up and
[36:11.800 --> 36:14.840]  throw some stuff together. You can get some ragu, you know what I mean? And go do it.
[36:14.840 --> 36:18.520]  But yeah, I probably could have microwave those things myself and not. Yeah.
[36:18.520 --> 36:23.240]  Yeah. I don't know. The way I look at it is why I charge so much when you're just doing something
[36:23.240 --> 36:26.520]  that someone could do for themselves. Maybe you can do a little better and make it taste better.
[36:26.520 --> 36:31.800]  So what? Don't charge so much, get more people and have fun. But everybody was money hungry. So
[36:31.800 --> 36:34.760]  I don't see eye to eye with a lot of people. That's why I jumped out of being a chef. I got
[36:34.760 --> 36:39.080]  tired of working, working, working to put money in other people's pockets when they're keeping
[36:39.400 --> 36:43.960]  right. And stuff. So it was like, thank God for Colorado being smart and let me grow cannabis
[36:43.960 --> 36:47.960]  where I live in, you know, love it. Love Jeff for letting us grow cannabis. It's so great.
[36:48.840 --> 36:52.840]  Yeah. So, man, yeah. So, so many things line up for being a chef and yeah, I love your eye for
[36:52.840 --> 37:00.760]  detail. That's in the passion. I see it. That's so awesome, man. I was going to sneeze. I tried
[37:00.760 --> 37:04.200]  to pause it. I didn't sneeze and be smooth about it. But then my whole face just twitched. I saved
[37:04.200 --> 37:08.600]  the sneeze. Okay. I'm not going to sneeze. New microphone. I can edit all that. So it's not a
[37:08.600 --> 37:12.760]  retarded. Where was I now? I don't even have any more notes. I don't think I know what I was going
[37:12.760 --> 37:19.400]  to say. My brain will remember. I really don't even remember what I was going to say. All right.
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.240]  Next topic, I guess. Yeah. You got anything else you want to throw in here or do you want to start
[37:23.240 --> 37:26.200]  wrapping it up since we're, since I'm gonna have to do an edit break right here anyway, which is
[37:26.200 --> 37:31.240]  not anything rare. We do a lot of podcasts. That's what I was going to ask you too. I wasn't going to,
[37:31.240 --> 37:34.360]  all right. So here I will just be quiet for half a second. Then I'll throw it like this.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.640]  All right, brother, man. Well, I've kept you for long enough. I'm sure you've got like a two hour
[37:37.640 --> 37:41.160]  drive to get home from here, right? Yeah. I guess we're getting up a six inches over the mountain.
[37:41.160 --> 37:44.280]  So is that really what's happening right now? Mom said before I left, she likes to check up.
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.680]  I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was looking earlier and it says that we're going to get some
[37:46.680 --> 37:50.120]  snow. So yeah, it's a, it's eight 15 now. So you're not going to get home till 10 15.
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.200]  Yeah. Sure. You got a real life. You got to work tomorrow. Uh, no weekends off, but yeah,
[37:54.200 --> 37:57.960]  there you go. Nice time with the kiddos. Excellent. Spend some time with the little tiny
[37:57.960 --> 38:01.320]  ones. Yeah. I really appreciate you coming and hanging out, driving two hours to come,
[38:01.320 --> 38:04.680]  hang out, do a podcast with me. That is cool as shit. Yeah. I appreciate you inviting me up and
[38:04.680 --> 38:07.960]  doing it, man. Anytime you need me, I'm here. Anytime you're passing through my neck of the
[38:07.960 --> 38:11.000]  woods. If you're by that exit, you better message me somehow. I'll give you my number right now.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.360]  We're doing it through Facebook. I'll give you my phone number so you can just straight text me and
[38:14.360 --> 38:17.480]  we'll get you over here. You can hang out. So people that are listening, make sure you follow
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.800]  the painted chef on all of the social media. Uh, if you want to stalk them on Facebook,
[38:21.800 --> 38:25.160]  you could do that, but you know, just go for the, go for the Instagram. Instagram's better. Yeah.
[38:25.160 --> 38:27.880]  Yeah. It's not so personal. You don't, you don't need to be checking out his kids and stuff. Look
[38:27.880 --> 38:31.320]  at his weed plants. I thought I'd keep my kids on there occasionally, but yeah, Instagram's way
[38:31.320 --> 38:35.080]  better. I'm more active on that anyway. We're probably going to fight over something if you
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.840]  get on me at Facebook. We don't mean to be so passive aggressive and or aggressive. We just
[38:40.840 --> 38:45.000]  have a lot of passion for cannabis and we want that shit done. Right. Yes. All right. You guys,
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.320]  um, I want to give a huge thank you to everybody who has contributed to my Patreon campaign. That
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.400]  is super kind of you. I truly do appreciate that. You guys might not know what I'm talking about.
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.800]  Patreon. It is a service where you can contribute financially to the podcast. All you have to do
[38:59.800 --> 39:05.240]  is go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart and you can make a financial contribution to the
[39:05.240 --> 39:09.480]  podcast. I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting. This podcast is always going to
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.040]  be free from my heart for you. I will put out one weekly episode because I love you guys. I love
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.760]  podcasting, love cannabis. It's going to be free, but if you were able, or if you would like to,
[39:18.760 --> 39:21.880]  or if you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks, all you have to do is go to
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.520]  patreon.com slash grow from your heart. You can contribute as little as $1. And I really don't
[39:26.520 --> 39:31.480]  think there's a limit on how many zeros or nines you can put at the end of that. So, uh, and it is
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.640]  a monthly signup. If you want to sign up for a monthly subscription, you will be charged on the
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.280]  first of every month on your credit card of choice, and it will send $1 to my PayPal account.
[39:40.280 --> 39:44.760]  And what I'm trying to do is offset the cost of my website. My website costs a chunk of change to
[39:44.760 --> 39:49.640]  keep alive every year. And that is where I host this podcast. So to keep it free without having
[39:49.640 --> 39:53.800]  to do something, I'll like charge you guys or go find other sponsors, just asking for a little bit
[39:53.800 --> 39:57.560]  of contribution through Patreon. So throw in a dollar on Patreon. I'll use it to pay for the
[39:57.560 --> 40:03.080]  website. We'll keep the podcast coming to you for free forever. I'd like to commit for forever,
[40:03.080 --> 40:08.360]  but you know, it's not like it's not worth it. I'm going to do my best. I pay a dollar to hear Jeff.
[40:08.360 --> 40:12.200]  Yeah. I think I could do that. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and if you can't contribute, I still love
[40:12.200 --> 40:16.040]  you. I still appreciate you. Uh, keep listening. Uh, that's you, that's how you're doing what you
[40:16.040 --> 40:21.080]  can do. And if you can't contribute and you want to do me some sort of favor, go to iTunes, go to
[40:21.480 --> 40:25.160]  let's see, how do you do it? You go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, uh, search for the growth of
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.800]  my heart podcast, find the review section. There you go. Now I'm back on track. I lost my ship for
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.840]  a second. There. Could you tell, uh, go to find the review section. Uh, everybody so far in the
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.520]  review section has given me a five-star review. So you could throw up a five-star review or whatever
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.280]  you feel like, uh, throw an overview, type in a comment. Let me know what you think of the podcast.
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.840]  And I do about once a month, go and read all of the iTunes comments that I have not read
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.040]  on the air. So you'll get to hear your comment on the show. Let me know what you think of the
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.080]  podcast, love it or hate it. I'll most likely read your post. You almost got me to switch to
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.400]  apple just so I could comment, but I just haven't done it yet. Cause you know me, I like to spread
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.040]  the love. I'd love to see your comment. That'd be cool. You need to just go make an iTunes account
[41:04.040 --> 41:10.040]  or somewhere that takes effort. I know too many buttons to push. I get it. I get it. Uh, once
[41:10.040 --> 41:13.640]  again, a big, huge shout out to our friends at handmade apparel. Also again, huge shout out to
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.960]  my friend, the painted chef. I think that's all I've got for this week. You got anything you want
[41:17.960 --> 41:22.120]  to say while you're on a podcast where a whole bunch of people are going to hear you, everyone
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.200]  out there, just do what you do with love. We need more love in this world. That's pretty much my
[41:26.200 --> 41:30.920]  whole stance for living right now. Love, love, love. I think we should just push stop and quit
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.360]  recording at this point. That was probably the best ending a podcast could ever have brother.
[41:34.360 --> 41:37.480]  I thank you very much for spreading that message and coming on the show with that. I look forward
[41:37.480 --> 41:41.160]  to having you here on the next time. Um, that's all we've got for this week. I want to give a
[41:41.160 --> 41:45.080]  huge shout out to sub cool and all of the weed nerds, all you guys out there, you guys know who

[41:49.560 --> 41:52.440]  next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
