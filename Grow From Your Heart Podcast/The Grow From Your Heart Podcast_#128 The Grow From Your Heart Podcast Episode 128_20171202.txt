[00:17.340 --> 00:19.780]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.780 --> 00:23.500]  It's time for episode number 128 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.940 --> 00:28.240]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:28.240 --> 00:30.220]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.260 --> 00:33.820]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.900 --> 00:36.620]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.780 --> 00:39.620]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:40.660 --> 00:42.980]  I want to thank you guys for joining me as always.
[00:42.980 --> 00:45.380]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:45.380 --> 00:48.380]  band for letting me use their music on my show. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:49.060 --> 00:50.900]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:56.780 --> 00:58.580]  I didn't cough into the mic. Nothing happened there.
[00:58.860 --> 01:01.100]  I never knew you did that freehand.
[01:01.180 --> 01:03.540]  I always figured that was pre-recorded and plugged in.
[01:03.700 --> 01:06.540]  Oh no, I do that at every episode. Sometimes I cough in the middle of it.
[01:06.540 --> 01:08.820]  This time I had something in the mustache that was going to make me sneeze,
[01:08.820 --> 01:11.180]  but I got through it. You guys, that voice joining me,
[01:11.180 --> 01:13.940]  you might recognize that deep, sexy, soulful voice over there.
[01:13.940 --> 01:16.420]  That Barry White guy over there. That's a good friend, Jesse.
[01:16.420 --> 01:18.220]  Thanks for joining us, bro. Oh yeah, for sure.
[01:19.300 --> 01:22.180]  Oh man. Any, any time you want to be here, uh,
[01:22.220 --> 01:25.220]  this is a great episode to have you. I just realized that, uh,
[01:25.220 --> 01:27.860]  these episodes are kind of recorded. We do two a week.
[01:27.860 --> 01:30.780]  Sometimes we'll do three a week and then I won't do one for a couple of weeks
[01:30.780 --> 01:33.180]  and then we'll put one out. Uh, they come out once a week,
[01:33.180 --> 01:37.100]  but right about now is two years of recording this podcast.
[01:37.100 --> 01:38.540]  It's our two year anniversary.
[01:38.580 --> 01:40.820]  So thanks for joining me on the two year ish episode, bro.
[01:41.620 --> 01:44.500]  Here's a good chance. I was sitting here somewhere around two years ago.
[01:44.540 --> 01:46.660]  Yeah, it's very likely. And I've been hanging out quite a bit.
[01:46.660 --> 01:49.700]  I bet the folks that have been listening consecutively consistently,
[01:49.700 --> 01:52.860]  I bet they've learned a shit ton of outdoor stuff from you. I hope so.
[01:52.900 --> 01:54.260]  And they're going to learn a lot more today.
[01:54.260 --> 01:57.100]  And the folks that have never met you are going to learn a lot about outdoor
[01:57.100 --> 02:00.100]  growing our mess. Our episode is all about outdoor growing this time. You guys,
[02:00.100 --> 02:03.380]  thanks for joining us. I hope you guys are dabbed out cause we're dabbed out.
[02:04.020 --> 02:06.580]  Uh, we're smoking some, uh, Turpex. I want to,
[02:06.580 --> 02:09.340]  I need to give a huge shout out to our friends at elevate glass in Colorado
[02:09.340 --> 02:12.180]  Springs. Um, I don't have their address right now and I do,
[02:12.180 --> 02:14.580]  it's five 17 South Tayhoan in Colorado Springs.
[02:14.580 --> 02:17.900]  Make sure you check out elevate glass. That's all the commercials for this one.
[02:18.940 --> 02:21.860]  So Jess, you haven't been here in a while, bro. Have you been good? Very busy.
[02:22.100 --> 02:25.220]  Good. Well, that's good for you. I got some licensing happening.
[02:25.220 --> 02:27.340]  Got some big things going on. I'm proud of you. Good job, man.
[02:27.620 --> 02:32.140]  We've got our, uh, MIP and our, um, in, uh, fuck.
[02:32.140 --> 02:34.740]  I can't remember the initials. So many initials in this industry.
[02:34.820 --> 02:38.180]  We've got our whole set towards your face a little. You just got to, uh, uh,
[02:38.220 --> 02:42.060]  grow with no store attached and a hash producing license.
[02:42.180 --> 02:47.100]  Nice. Uh, BHO hash or like water hash CO2 CO2. Very cool.
[02:47.180 --> 02:50.260]  I don't own the company. That's not the choice I would have made, but,
[02:50.380 --> 02:53.220]  but it's still a good product. They're not cutting any corners with it.
[02:53.220 --> 02:54.060]  I can tell you that much.
[02:54.300 --> 02:59.300]  Have you tried any of the distillate that's made from CO2? No, I really love that.
[02:59.540 --> 03:02.460]  I've heard about it and I did not know that it was made from CO2 oil.
[03:02.780 --> 03:06.340]  This here, this is Sphere X. I'm about to drop it.
[03:06.540 --> 03:09.380]  I've got two containers stacked up cause it's hard to get that bottom bit out.
[03:09.380 --> 03:11.740]  So I just turned this one upside down and put it on there and it dripped into
[03:11.740 --> 03:16.100]  there. It did it for me. That's some Sphere X it's made from CO2 oil.
[03:16.100 --> 03:17.060]  And then they turn it, they use,
[03:17.460 --> 03:20.380]  they use a fractal distillation process as far as I understand.
[03:20.660 --> 03:24.380]  I don't know exactly what that is, but I know that the basics and they pull out
[03:24.380 --> 03:27.220]  the goodies and that's what it looks like. We'll take a dab of it here.
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.900]  We can't do it right now. It's just too much of a pain in the ass.
[03:29.020 --> 03:31.260]  We'll do it after the show. I'll leave it here. So we see it. Yeah,
[03:31.260 --> 03:34.620]  that's made from CO2 oil. So it got, uh, some serious turps on it.
[03:34.620 --> 03:37.100]  It's got some serious turps on it. I'm gonna crack this one open.
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.700]  So now you're reaching for the clear. I like the clear. Honestly,
[03:40.820 --> 03:44.980]  I like this Sphere X better. Okay. Yeah. That's clear from California. Uh,
[03:45.020 --> 03:47.580]  it's the super lemon. Hey, is this is Sphere X OG Kush.
[03:47.820 --> 03:50.580]  And I liked the turps on this one. I prefer the Sphere X.
[03:50.980 --> 03:53.500]  Sorry to my friends in the clear. Those are my homies. They listen to the show.
[03:53.540 --> 03:56.180]  I'm honest about the things I smoke and review. Oh man.
[03:57.100 --> 04:01.460]  It's almost overwhelming, right? Yeah. It's literally, um, wow.
[04:01.620 --> 04:05.740]  It's it's almost too turpy. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I can see that.
[04:06.300 --> 04:08.260]  You gotta, you gotta take little dabs of that one. I put,
[04:08.540 --> 04:12.580]  I'll take a big dab of something else and dip it into that a little bit so that
[04:12.580 --> 04:15.580]  it's not so overwhelming. Yeah. This one out the Sphere X,
[04:15.580 --> 04:19.380]  I could dab a gram of it by itself and not cough. My throat doesn't burn.
[04:19.700 --> 04:22.660]  It's super smooth. Yeah. So shout out to the guys at Sphere X.
[04:22.660 --> 04:25.900]  You just got some free advertising from us. Hey,
[04:25.900 --> 04:27.660]  that happens when you make a good product. It does.
[04:27.660 --> 04:31.660]  When you make a good product, Rasta Jeff will give you a shout out. Um, so yeah,
[04:31.660 --> 04:34.100]  let's talk about outdoor growing, man. Everything's going good for you.
[04:34.100 --> 04:36.020]  You got the new, uh, the business running. Yeah.
[04:36.060 --> 04:38.340]  It's time to grow some outdoor weed. Uh,
[04:38.340 --> 04:42.660]  hopefully people have access to some clones or some seeds cause now it's time to
[04:42.660 --> 04:46.140]  get those going. Yeah. Especially seeds. Yeah. Yeah.
[04:46.460 --> 04:49.780]  You might be a little behind if you're growing from seeds. You might be by now.
[04:49.780 --> 04:52.340]  Yes. Uh, so I guess the first question,
[04:52.340 --> 04:56.940]  when should we put our plants outdoors in Colorado? Um,
[04:57.020 --> 05:02.020]  second week of May is kind of rule of thumb. That's like the earliest I do it.
[05:02.500 --> 05:05.660]  All right. Um, I've put them out, you know, uh,
[05:05.700 --> 05:09.420]  first of June and they still yielded just as good as the ones that went out the
[05:09.420 --> 05:12.380]  second week of May. They get a little extra attention to catch them up.
[05:12.460 --> 05:16.460]  But yeah. So, okay. So you got about a two week window that's primed to put them
[05:16.460 --> 05:19.060]  out. Yeah. Get them out by the first weekend of June though.
[05:19.060 --> 05:21.580]  If you haven't done it by then, carry them out. Oh, excuse me.
[05:21.580 --> 05:25.820]  I'm burping carry them out that weekend. Get them started, get them outdoors. Uh,
[05:25.860 --> 05:30.060]  do you know offhand when we're going to start the flowering season? Uh,
[05:30.460 --> 05:32.220]  it kind of varies from strain to strain,
[05:32.340 --> 05:36.980]  but typically it's around the end of July, beginning of August. So, um,
[05:37.020 --> 05:41.460]  that's here in Colorado. I believe that does change a little regionally. Right.
[05:41.460 --> 05:42.740]  That's going to be a little bit different. Uh,
[05:42.780 --> 05:44.580]  the dates when you put stuff outside,
[05:44.900 --> 05:47.140]  the timeframes are going to be a little bit different, uh,
[05:47.180 --> 05:50.820]  varying from coast to coast, California. You could put them out today.
[05:51.300 --> 05:54.420]  There's probably be okay. I have friends on Instagram that they're already out
[05:54.420 --> 05:57.340]  today or they've been out for weeks, honestly. Yeah. Well,
[05:57.900 --> 06:00.420]  Oregon and Northern California, they're spoiled out there though. Yeah.
[06:02.420 --> 06:06.100]  We can't do it like that. It's cool. Yeah. We do crush it though.
[06:06.420 --> 06:10.500]  We figure out how to fix that. All right. Uh, so get them out there. The,
[06:10.580 --> 06:14.020]  the first week of June at the latest, uh, get them out there, get them ready.
[06:14.140 --> 06:16.460]  Hopefully you've got some clones. You've got some seeds. They're going,
[06:16.460 --> 06:19.140]  you've had them sexed already. You know, if they're boys or girls, uh,
[06:19.180 --> 06:20.860]  get some plants healthy. Uh,
[06:20.860 --> 06:24.220]  don't get them too big cause they're going to grow really quickly outdoors.
[06:24.420 --> 06:24.780]  Last year,
[06:24.780 --> 06:27.460]  a lot of people weren't prepared for the size of plants that they were growing
[06:27.460 --> 06:30.980]  and that shit got way too big. Uh, their camouflage got away from them.
[06:30.980 --> 06:34.380]  Their fences were way too low. Yeah. Shit went crazy. That's a good thing,
[06:34.380 --> 06:36.620]  but it's also a bad thing. So be prepared for that.
[06:36.620 --> 06:39.340]  Your plants are going to get really large outdoors. Um,
[06:39.380 --> 06:43.300]  make sure they're not root bound either. Uh, that's really important when you
[06:43.300 --> 06:46.740]  take them outside. Yeah. Uh, when you put them in the ground, I've just,
[06:46.780 --> 06:50.220]  I've noticed through my years of experience, uh, root bound plants,
[06:50.260 --> 06:53.620]  sometimes they go into shock going outside. Um,
[06:53.620 --> 06:57.460]  sometimes they go into shock in a way that they want to start flowering right
[06:57.460 --> 07:01.100]  away. Yeah. Right away. And that's no good. Um,
[07:01.180 --> 07:04.660]  so make sure they're not root bound and it's, you know, if you have,
[07:04.940 --> 07:09.220]  if the weather is holding or like you have a greenhouse or something you can put
[07:09.220 --> 07:11.620]  out earlier than the second week of May,
[07:12.220 --> 07:16.260]  but also right now we're around 12 hours of light here in the, uh,
[07:16.300 --> 07:21.300]  first week of April. Um, so if you put plants outside,
[07:22.060 --> 07:25.940]  there is a chance they can go into bloom. Um, and you don't want that to happen.
[07:25.940 --> 07:28.100]  Cause they're going to re veg, aren't they? Yeah. Yeah.
[07:28.100 --> 07:29.260]  We're going to have, they're going to flower.
[07:29.260 --> 07:31.100]  Then they're going to go back and they're going to re flower.
[07:31.100 --> 07:35.020]  The hormones are going to be all fucked up. Bad structure,
[07:35.860 --> 07:39.700]  limbs break off and it's just no good. All right. So kind of be,
[07:39.700 --> 07:40.820]  don't let them get root bound.
[07:40.820 --> 07:43.820]  And that leads me into my next question perfectly. Um,
[07:43.860 --> 07:47.540]  I was going to ask you if we should plant into the dirt outside or if we should
[07:47.700 --> 07:51.180]  take them outside in pots. Um, my, I mean,
[07:51.300 --> 07:55.100]  my preferred method of being kind of a crunchy hippie, uh,
[07:55.100 --> 07:59.540]  I like to plant straight in the ground. Um, it's, it's less work. I feel like,
[07:59.700 --> 08:03.260]  uh, and the plants just are healthier, but you know,
[08:03.260 --> 08:06.860]  doing it in containers is very, very possible to, um,
[08:07.180 --> 08:11.380]  last year I did plants in 150 gallons smart pots for the first time.
[08:11.820 --> 08:16.060]  And I was really stoked with those. How big were your stocks? Uh, gigantic.
[08:16.660 --> 08:20.540]  Your arms, the, the first and second round of plants that got put in there,
[08:20.540 --> 08:23.140]  got stolen by some fucking asshole.
[08:25.180 --> 08:27.620]  I haven't talked much about it, but I had a horrible summer.
[08:27.900 --> 08:29.020]  I never mentioned it on the show,
[08:29.020 --> 08:31.500]  but we talked about some people getting ripped off. You were one of those.
[08:32.660 --> 08:36.220]  Fuck whoever took Jesse's plants. So they didn't get as big as they is.
[08:36.260 --> 08:40.260]  You know, if the first ones I put out there would have got left there. Um,
[08:40.380 --> 08:43.340]  the stocks probably would have been as big around as a two liter bottle.
[08:44.220 --> 08:46.980]  They ended up about as big around as one of these, uh,
[08:47.100 --> 08:51.260]  arrowhead water bottles or 20 ounce of water bottles. Okay. Wow.
[08:51.900 --> 08:55.260]  And that was with, uh, about four and a half weeks of edge.
[08:56.100 --> 09:00.660]  They were going to be beasts. Yeah. Um, the, the first ones that got taken,
[09:00.740 --> 09:04.820]  they were my string government mule. And as, um,
[09:05.060 --> 09:07.300]  you want to tell us about government mule? I'll give you an opportunity to do
[09:07.300 --> 09:11.940]  that. Sure. It's a, it's made by Shemira, I think,
[09:11.940 --> 09:13.180]  which is a chimera chimera,
[09:13.980 --> 09:18.020]  is a company that's not really in existence anymore. He's still around though.
[09:18.060 --> 09:22.060]  Yeah. Yeah. He just doesn't make seeds anymore. Um, but it's a deep junk,
[09:22.140 --> 09:27.100]  Tom Hills, deep junk crossed with, uh, uh, G 13. Okay. Uh,
[09:27.100 --> 09:29.300]  it's a, you were growing the shit out of that. Yeah.
[09:29.340 --> 09:33.860]  The Fino I have is like period to go. Uh, it's real short and stocky.
[09:34.340 --> 09:39.180]  Um, and this plant that was in the 150 gallon smart pot last year, um,
[09:39.340 --> 09:44.020]  within maybe six weeks of being outside or no, it didn't make it that long. Uh,
[09:44.060 --> 09:48.220]  probably about four weeks with being outside. It was seriously eight foot tall,
[09:48.420 --> 09:50.380]  six foot around six foot. You know,
[09:50.460 --> 09:55.460]  it was just beast and that's not a strain that really beasts like that.
[09:55.820 --> 10:00.380]  So if it would have, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. All right. So that's,
[10:00.420 --> 10:02.260]  that leads me perfectly. You keep helping me out.
[10:02.260 --> 10:05.780]  You're segueing into my next questions on accident here. Um,
[10:06.340 --> 10:08.780]  if we're going to put our plants into the ground,
[10:09.060 --> 10:11.580]  do we just want to throw them into the dirt that's in the backyard or do we want
[10:11.580 --> 10:13.420]  to dig a hole and put some good dirt in there?
[10:13.420 --> 10:16.540]  Some good soil that we buy from the store or do we just want to use the backyard
[10:16.540 --> 10:21.140]  soil? Um, I mean, if, if that's all you have, you can use it. Okay.
[10:21.460 --> 10:25.620]  I wouldn't know. Um, right. Uh, especially here in Southern Colorado,
[10:25.620 --> 10:29.340]  native soil, um, it's pretty hard. It's pretty dusty and kind of clay like,
[10:29.700 --> 10:31.180]  yeah, it's been killed off pretty good,
[10:31.180 --> 10:35.380]  especially like in residential areas and stuff. So, um, it,
[10:35.380 --> 10:40.060]  it doesn't hold water. Well, um, when it's dusty like that, uh,
[10:40.100 --> 10:43.460]  the nutrients that are in it, because it's shell based soil,
[10:43.460 --> 10:47.500]  there's a shit ton of nutrients in it, but it's not accessible to the plant
[10:47.940 --> 10:50.900]  because of the structure of the soil. So you're growing,
[10:51.020 --> 10:55.380]  you basically end up growing in a pretty super salty environment. Yeah. Yeah.
[10:55.420 --> 11:00.420]  Literally. Um, so at the very minimum to have, you know,
[11:00.620 --> 11:01.460]  pretty good results,
[11:01.460 --> 11:06.460]  I'd recommend cutting your native soil with like one part cocoa coir or one part
[11:06.980 --> 11:11.980]  peat moss and then one part native soil and then one part,
[11:12.460 --> 11:15.300]  uh, worm castings or compost. Okay. So,
[11:15.780 --> 11:20.780]  and by default that that soil recipe pretty much works everywhere.
[11:21.100 --> 11:25.020]  Um, and you'll end up with some really great soil. So I hope you guys wrote that
[11:25.020 --> 11:27.060]  down, you know, that'd be your base.
[11:27.060 --> 11:31.100]  So then you can still add extra amendments to that also, if you, if you wish,
[11:31.140 --> 11:35.100]  you can afford it and if you want to. Yeah. Okay. That's like farmer recipe.
[11:35.100 --> 11:39.340]  That's produce gets grown on that recipe. Like in the raised, uh,
[11:39.380 --> 11:42.820]  permaculture beds. Okay. That's, that's it. So, all right. Yeah.
[11:42.860 --> 11:47.700]  So can we throw that same recipe into those 150 gallon smart pots?
[11:47.740 --> 11:49.500]  That's it. That's actually exactly what I did.
[11:49.500 --> 11:52.220]  I added a little more aeration to it. Um,
[11:52.220 --> 11:55.700]  and maybe went a little bit heavier on the peat moss. But yeah,
[11:55.700 --> 11:59.420]  that's exactly what I did. So yeah. And it, it worked out great.
[11:59.460 --> 12:03.380]  Stocks the size of football of two liter gallons. That's huge, bro. That is huge.
[12:03.980 --> 12:05.620]  Good job. I wish you had pictures to show me.
[12:06.740 --> 12:07.580]  Me too.
[12:09.020 --> 12:10.340]  All right. So, uh,
[12:10.340 --> 12:12.740]  I'm going to throw out a little bit of a soil mix that I wrote down.
[12:12.740 --> 12:15.660]  I would buy if I were going to use 150 gallon smart pots outside,
[12:15.820 --> 12:18.540]  that's gotta be a huge pot. How's that? About six feet around? Yeah. Yeah.
[12:19.020 --> 12:22.740]  Three feet tall. It's like a kid pool. It's about that tall. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[12:22.740 --> 12:26.740]  About 24, 28 inches ish. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So yeah, that's,
[12:26.780 --> 12:30.900]  that's a kid pool. Yeah. Fill it up with Jello and people wrestle in there.
[12:31.740 --> 12:35.140]  So I would put, I would buy some bagged soilless mix. Um,
[12:35.780 --> 12:38.820]  I'm not too picky about that. Whatever the store has. I like the roots organic.
[12:38.820 --> 12:42.620]  I like Tupper. Uh, it's pretty much all the same shit. It's a little bit different.
[12:42.620 --> 12:44.860]  It's all the same. And then the same, right? Yeah. You run a hydro store.
[12:44.860 --> 12:46.660]  You know what I'm talking about? It's all the same different shit.
[12:46.700 --> 12:49.580]  Roots has more aeration in it. Like your Fox farm products.
[12:49.980 --> 12:52.940]  I always feel like they need a little perlite or something added.
[12:53.420 --> 12:56.060]  And they need to be sifted because there's sticks and shit and Fox farms all
[12:56.100 --> 12:59.300]  the time. What the hell are they doing? Uh, so I'd go with some bagged soil.
[12:59.300 --> 13:00.820]  It doesn't matter what you use. Uh,
[13:00.820 --> 13:03.580]  I would definitely put worm castings in there. I like the cocoa core.
[13:03.580 --> 13:06.020]  Like Jesse said, I think it gives the plants a little bit, uh,
[13:06.020 --> 13:07.860]  it's adds moisture to the plant's life.
[13:07.860 --> 13:10.100]  Their vascular system's a little more healthy. Uh,
[13:10.140 --> 13:12.220]  they just seem more hydrated with the cocoa in there.
[13:12.380 --> 13:16.020]  I think they get more flavor cocoa most definitely. It, it, well,
[13:16.300 --> 13:18.500]  it holds water differently than Pete must does.
[13:18.620 --> 13:21.820]  So you're like doubling down right there and you can use a little more nutrient.
[13:21.860 --> 13:24.460]  You need a little more nutrient with that. Yeah. That's always fun. Uh,
[13:24.460 --> 13:26.500]  I like to put perlite in there, uh,
[13:26.540 --> 13:29.420]  just to keep it airy and fluffy and then it helps you not over water,
[13:29.940 --> 13:32.620]  especially in outdoor situations. You might get a rainy ass night,
[13:32.620 --> 13:35.740]  that perlite save your life for sure. Uh, the Pete Moss, like you were taught,
[13:35.740 --> 13:39.340]  or the Pete, like you're saying. And then for pest prevention, I,
[13:39.380 --> 13:41.940]  we learned this from our good friend, Sean, shout out to King Cola.
[13:41.940 --> 13:42.780]  If you're listening,
[13:42.780 --> 13:46.660]  I like to mix in the Karanja meal and neem cakes if we're going outdoors just to
[13:46.660 --> 13:51.020]  keep those bugs away. Yeah. That's, that's part of my personal, I mean, you,
[13:51.060 --> 13:53.020]  yeah, you came real close to my personal recipe.
[13:53.020 --> 13:56.140]  Would you put some oyster shell in there? Uh, yes. Very. All right.
[13:56.340 --> 13:58.580]  I'm learning the outdoor from you guys. I don't do it myself,
[13:58.580 --> 13:59.700]  but that's why I bring you guys.
[13:59.740 --> 14:04.420]  Here's a trick on the oyster shell ad go to hydro store guy,
[14:04.420 --> 14:08.940]  giving away. Okay. Go to the feed store and get oyster shell for chickens.
[14:10.100 --> 14:13.300]  Um, the it's been collected off the beach. It's not ground up.
[14:13.620 --> 14:17.700]  It's whole oyster shell breaks down. It takes it more time to break down.
[14:18.260 --> 14:21.300]  So put that in as a bit of a time release and then get the powder,
[14:21.700 --> 14:22.140]  powder,
[14:22.140 --> 14:26.900]  iced a oyster shell from your local hydro store and you got two different,
[14:26.940 --> 14:29.780]  uh, two different available times. Yeah, that's awesome. Good tips.
[14:29.780 --> 14:31.020]  You get all the way through the season.
[14:31.300 --> 14:34.860]  I like that you're a hydro store guy that doesn't just make a shop at the hydro
[14:34.860 --> 14:36.940]  store. You recommend feed store stuff. Yeah.
[14:36.940 --> 14:39.660]  I had to pay for the shit too, man. I mean, right.
[14:40.260 --> 14:41.380]  Uh, one thing I want to mention,
[14:41.900 --> 14:44.540]  you can use bottled nutrients in your outdoor grow.
[14:44.540 --> 14:47.700]  If you're just going to throw the plants into some soil containers or dig a hole
[14:47.700 --> 14:50.580]  in your backyard, you can go to the store, you can buy some botanic care,
[14:50.580 --> 14:53.100]  you can buy some nectar of the gods. You can buy whatever brand they've got,
[14:53.100 --> 14:56.940]  their a and B their bloom feed solution, other bloom boosters.
[14:56.940 --> 14:59.620]  You can mix that up. If you're throwing it into some outdoor soil,
[14:59.620 --> 15:01.260]  you can actually mix it up kind of heavy.
[15:01.940 --> 15:04.340]  You can feed it pretty damn strong with that stuff outdoors.
[15:04.860 --> 15:08.780]  You can do that if you're not able to, maybe somebody's not able bodied.
[15:08.780 --> 15:10.260]  We're pretty healthy dudes. We could do things.
[15:10.300 --> 15:12.460]  Maybe somebody doesn't have the physical capabilities.
[15:12.700 --> 15:15.860]  They could throw a few pots in the backyard and mix up some nutrients and have
[15:15.860 --> 15:16.740]  somebody help them do that way.
[15:16.740 --> 15:19.060]  Instead of having to mix up a big batch of dirt and plant these,
[15:19.260 --> 15:23.420]  you can do that. You guys, for sure. We would just as a, as a ganja farmer,
[15:23.820 --> 15:26.620]  myself and indoor ganja farmer and Jesse and outdoor farm boy,
[15:26.900 --> 15:30.500]  I think we'd rather lead people into this way of mixing up some soil outdoors
[15:30.500 --> 15:32.300]  and letting nature kind of do its thing.
[15:32.420 --> 15:34.020]  It takes a lot of the guesswork out of it.
[15:34.180 --> 15:35.460]  So this will,
[15:35.900 --> 15:40.700]  this will promote pest prevention and a healthy environment using those
[15:40.820 --> 15:44.980]  bottle nutrients. Isn't going to contribute to a plant health.
[15:44.980 --> 15:46.940]  It's only going to contribute to big buds.
[15:47.060 --> 15:49.300]  Yeah. And the soil recipes we're talking about here,
[15:49.300 --> 15:52.540]  they actually help with the healing of the earth.
[15:53.220 --> 15:55.700]  They contribute back to that. They make the soil better.
[15:56.140 --> 15:59.900]  So when you leave there, that piece of ground is better than it was before.
[16:01.020 --> 16:03.220]  And that's one, you know, you,
[16:03.300 --> 16:07.460]  I suppose you can do that with bottle nutrients to just watch out for salt
[16:07.460 --> 16:08.860]  buildups and stuff like that. So,
[16:08.940 --> 16:13.940]  right. It's not as friendly. And if you do grow outside, do it on your land,
[16:14.060 --> 16:18.340]  don't do it in some national forest. Don't be an idiot like that.
[16:18.740 --> 16:23.060]  And clean your shit up. Like take your bottles inside. Don't make, don't. Yeah.
[16:23.060 --> 16:24.940]  Like Jesse said, make it better than when you found it.
[16:24.940 --> 16:27.260]  Just like when you go camping, make it cleaner than when you found it.
[16:27.260 --> 16:28.980]  Pick up some trash, shout out four pieces.
[16:29.140 --> 16:33.420]  I think I have told the story on some of the older episodes or the earlier ones,
[16:33.460 --> 16:38.460]  but a few years ago there was a gigantic cartel bust here in the mountains real
[16:39.260 --> 16:40.100]  near here.
[16:40.860 --> 16:44.620]  And I have family land that neighbors the land where they got busted on.
[16:45.540 --> 16:49.220]  So we hiked in, you know, after the cops, you know,
[16:49.220 --> 16:50.620]  just to check it out and look around.
[16:51.020 --> 16:54.540]  And the amount of trash up there was just appalling. It's terrible.
[16:54.860 --> 16:58.380]  I grew up on that mountain. And you know, it was kind of,
[16:59.220 --> 17:02.380]  almost brings a tear to your eye to see that, see that up there.
[17:02.740 --> 17:07.420]  And is it accessible to folks like us? No, no, you'd be trespassing.
[17:07.540 --> 17:11.180]  I have permission from the, excuse me from coffin. What if we went to clean it?
[17:11.180 --> 17:15.020]  That's not really trespassing. Is it? I don't, I don't think anyone,
[17:15.100 --> 17:19.180]  I don't think Bob would say anything. So that is, I was going to say,
[17:19.860 --> 17:21.540]  what was that four years ago that happened?
[17:22.380 --> 17:24.780]  We're still hauling trash out of there. And this, we make it,
[17:25.340 --> 17:29.820]  it is a pretty good hike from the road or from where my cabin is.
[17:30.980 --> 17:35.540]  But we make a few trips up there. You're in awesome trash out. That's yeah,
[17:35.620 --> 17:39.380]  it's ridiculous how much was up there. So it's just,
[17:40.180 --> 17:44.420]  also it's ridiculous how much the cops in the DEA left up there.
[17:44.420 --> 17:47.580]  Cause you could tell the trash from the cartel growers and you can tell the
[17:47.580 --> 17:50.340]  trash from the cops and they just left shit up there.
[17:50.420 --> 17:54.060]  The Dunkin' Donuts was from the cops and the beans and rice was from the cartel.
[17:54.100 --> 17:56.780]  Yup. That's not even, that's real. No, no, straight up.
[17:56.780 --> 18:01.100]  No I had free, you told me in my, one of my friends' dads was a police officer.
[18:01.100 --> 18:02.660]  I don't know how much I'm supposed to talk about that.
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.660]  He's not a cop anymore, so they can't probably do shit.
[18:04.660 --> 18:08.740]  But he was retiring at the time and they called him and had him go stand there
[18:08.740 --> 18:11.580]  and watch like once they raided, everybody ran,
[18:11.580 --> 18:12.980]  but they needed the teams to get up there.
[18:12.980 --> 18:15.140]  Like the DEA and shit wanted to go and investigate.
[18:15.540 --> 18:19.260]  So he stood there and watched, just made sure that nobody went in that area.
[18:19.280 --> 18:23.020]  But he said that he walked around and they had little camps set up like stoves
[18:23.020 --> 18:26.140]  with beans and rice and all the, all the food was from Mexico.
[18:26.140 --> 18:29.380]  It was all Mexican packaging and they're straight up making Mexican dinner up
[18:29.380 --> 18:30.220]  there every night.
[18:30.260 --> 18:34.220]  Even the miracle can grow containers that I have cleaned up off there.
[18:34.980 --> 18:37.620]  They have Mexican writing on them. There's no English on them whatsoever.
[18:37.780 --> 18:42.300]  You're like segueing into the things that I have in my mind for the show on
[18:42.300 --> 18:43.900]  accident, which is fucking awesome.
[18:45.020 --> 18:47.500]  Would you add anything to the soil mix before we move on? Would you,
[18:47.500 --> 18:49.860]  do you use Azomite, Azomite? Yeah. Yeah.
[18:49.860 --> 18:51.900]  So I'm gonna write that down for next year's lessons.
[18:51.940 --> 18:54.660]  I like doing minerals, so I do the salt.
[18:54.820 --> 18:59.820]  This is a real similar to the Clackamas Coot recipe from the forums,
[18:59.940 --> 19:02.460]  build a soil, but, uh, but that's old school, bro.
[19:02.460 --> 19:07.220]  I haven't heard that name in a long time. Really? Nice. Um, uh,
[19:07.260 --> 19:11.820]  basalt gypsum, and these are all things you can find at your local garden stores,
[19:11.820 --> 19:16.580]  especially like gypsum, dolomite lime. Uh, those are all pretty easy to find.
[19:17.060 --> 19:20.820]  Um, then I use Azomite, uh, those four combinations of minerals.
[19:20.820 --> 19:24.300]  You got pretty much every single trace mineral in the world covered right there.
[19:24.380 --> 19:26.820]  That's going to make your plants turpy. It's going to make them healthy.
[19:27.020 --> 19:31.500]  You're going to smell real well. Um, and then oyster shell, um, uh,
[19:31.700 --> 19:34.620]  shrimp mill, fish mill, some, something like that. Some kind of,
[19:34.700 --> 19:37.740]  I like aqua products. I stay away from bone mill, blood mill,
[19:37.740 --> 19:40.740]  like slaughterhouse products. I would use kelp meal if that were up to me.
[19:40.780 --> 19:43.900]  So I'm gonna write down kelp mill for my, my style, just for what I prefer.
[19:44.020 --> 19:48.580]  I used to, yeah. Tons of coat mill, um, uh,
[19:48.660 --> 19:52.900]  alfalfa mill. Uh, good for a Neiman. Yeah. Okay.
[19:52.940 --> 19:55.460]  And alfalfa breaks down really quick. So, um,
[19:55.940 --> 19:59.340]  that can give you some of that real early season, you know,
[19:59.460 --> 20:02.540]  boost to get them exploded to, you know, uh,
[20:02.620 --> 20:04.820]  pot bottle sized stocks and four weeks.
[20:04.860 --> 20:08.140]  Your plants are going to take up 90% of their nitrogen during the vegetative
[20:08.140 --> 20:09.300]  phase of their lives.
[20:09.820 --> 20:13.220]  And you actually, you don't want to over spike that.
[20:13.220 --> 20:16.460]  That's why alfalfa mill is good. Cause it breaks down so quick. Uh,
[20:16.500 --> 20:18.860]  you in the middle of flowering towards the end of flowering,
[20:18.860 --> 20:21.100]  you don't want them to find a source of nitrogen, uh,
[20:21.140 --> 20:22.660]  that can F some shit up. Yeah.
[20:22.700 --> 20:25.220]  Make them taste funky and it'll slow down the flowering phase.
[20:25.220 --> 20:28.060]  Dress the buds out a little. Yeah. They'll start to finger. Yeah.
[20:28.100 --> 20:30.740]  You get the little fingers, uh, Foxtails. Um, all right.
[20:30.740 --> 20:32.820]  So you said a minute ago, uh,
[20:32.900 --> 20:36.140]  you cleaned up a bunch of fucking miracle grow containers from that cartel grow
[20:36.140 --> 20:38.860]  site. Uh, you guys, if you want to Google the cartel grow site,
[20:38.860 --> 20:39.700]  I'm sure you could find it.
[20:39.700 --> 20:43.460]  It was a cartel grow found in the San Isabel national forest area off highway
[20:43.500 --> 20:48.060]  one 65 is about probably four or five years ago. I was well,
[20:48.060 --> 20:50.060]  well covered by the news around here. Uh,
[20:50.100 --> 20:52.340]  so they threw out a bunch of miracle grow containers,
[20:52.340 --> 20:55.260]  which tells me that they probably weren't growing super quality product. No,
[20:55.260 --> 20:55.980]  no. Uh,
[20:55.980 --> 21:00.740]  let's talk for a minute about why we should never use miracle grow or any Scots
[21:00.780 --> 21:04.500]  type of product. First of all, miracle grow is made by Scots,
[21:04.540 --> 21:08.140]  which is owned by Monsanto, which is, uh,
[21:08.260 --> 21:12.180]  trying to force the entire world to be force fed seeds that are made by them,
[21:12.180 --> 21:17.060]  which are all GMO produced to be able to be sprayed by their products that are
[21:17.060 --> 21:21.380]  made by them. They're ruining a whole bunch of things and not healthy.
[21:21.380 --> 21:24.780]  I'm just fucking talking in a circle right now, but they're killing the bees.
[21:24.780 --> 21:27.380]  They're they're real. It's all about money for those guys.
[21:27.380 --> 21:30.500]  Science has shown they're pretty much single handedly responsible for the,
[21:30.660 --> 21:31.940]  the be die off right now.
[21:32.300 --> 21:36.260]  So we do not want to support anything with Monsanto in the first place is why we
[21:36.260 --> 21:40.540]  don't want to use any type of miracle grow or Scots products. Uh,
[21:40.700 --> 21:44.620]  if you're going to buy stuff like that, go to, uh, go to a hydroponic store,
[21:44.620 --> 21:48.100]  go to your local grow store, get a decent grow soil.
[21:48.100 --> 21:51.460]  Don't go get like a turf builder at home Depot or at Lowe's.
[21:52.820 --> 21:54.700]  A lot of people hate on the Fox farm brand.
[21:54.700 --> 21:58.860]  I think that's actually available at some of the larger hardware stores like ACE
[21:58.900 --> 22:03.220]  may have Fox farm. Fox farm isn't amazing, but it's definitely not bad. Yeah.
[22:03.300 --> 22:07.620]  It's if you're going to buy something at ACE or home Depot or Lowe's get Fox farm,
[22:07.620 --> 22:09.860]  don't get the Scots brand stuff. Yeah. Uh,
[22:09.860 --> 22:12.980]  pro mix is available at most of those places too. Pro mix is a good product.
[22:13.300 --> 22:17.660]  Sunshine for pro mix. Yeah. The sunshine, different companies. Okay.
[22:17.700 --> 22:21.740]  But it looks very similar. It's a pretty much the same shit. Okay.
[22:22.060 --> 22:26.100]  Different proprietary blends of micro micro eyes and
[22:26.940 --> 22:30.500]  the pro mix is good shit. You can buy that in bulk. Yeah. They sell that in.
[22:30.500 --> 22:33.820]  So if you're doing some outdoor pro mix, I'd go get that. That's not bad at all.
[22:34.500 --> 22:37.140]  These amendments, you'd be fucking golden out there.
[22:37.460 --> 22:40.540]  But let's talk about why not to use it. Uh, first of all,
[22:40.580 --> 22:42.940]  the obvious reasons that they're Monsanto products,
[22:43.220 --> 22:47.060]  but they're way overloaded with the wrong NPK ratios.
[22:47.700 --> 22:50.460]  Ton of nitrogen, tons of nitrogen, way too much.
[22:50.780 --> 22:54.620]  And that soil is loaded with these little, they used to be green when I was a kid,
[22:54.620 --> 22:58.780]  these little green speckles. Yeah. And those are time release nitrogen.
[22:58.780 --> 23:02.220]  And basically they're a little time release vitamins for the plant.
[23:02.660 --> 23:06.580]  So what sucks about that is you don't have very good control of what you're
[23:06.600 --> 23:08.660]  feeding your plant. However often you water,
[23:08.740 --> 23:11.060]  those are going to dissolve and your plant's going to get that nutrient.
[23:11.580 --> 23:14.900]  You don't want nutrients go into your plant every single time you water.
[23:15.940 --> 23:17.340]  You're going to start getting salt buildup.
[23:17.340 --> 23:19.620]  You're going to start getting crinkled leaves. You're going to see burnt tips.
[23:19.620 --> 23:22.820]  You buds aren't going to taste funny. Uh, so don't use that type of stuff.
[23:22.820 --> 23:26.300]  Don't use any of that miracle grow feeding, go to a real growth store.
[23:26.300 --> 23:29.500]  If I recommend botanic hair, um, nectar of the gods,
[23:29.500 --> 23:32.220]  I've seen great results from nectar of the gods recently.
[23:32.220 --> 23:33.620]  Shout out to my buddy, Steve Dufino.
[23:33.620 --> 23:35.020]  I don't know if you listened to the podcast, bro,
[23:35.020 --> 23:39.060]  but you grow with nectar of the gods and the stuff you grow tastes really good.
[23:39.060 --> 23:42.860]  So a nectar of the gods is good. Botanic care is good. Um,
[23:42.940 --> 23:46.540]  I've used advanced nutrients and I had okay results,
[23:46.540 --> 23:49.700]  but I was more happy with botanic care by a long shot.
[23:50.220 --> 23:53.740]  I did not like psycho at all. The psycho brand, I do not approve.
[23:53.740 --> 23:56.700]  I did not like it. Uh, there are a lot of brands available at the store.
[23:56.700 --> 23:57.700]  What's super hot right now.
[23:57.700 --> 23:59.740]  I haven't been paying too much attention to the new stuff.
[23:59.860 --> 24:04.180]  Nectar. We push, um, nectar's coming up.
[24:04.180 --> 24:08.060]  It takes a while to get people switched over to the line. Um, you know,
[24:08.060 --> 24:11.380]  from my perspective or from the retail setting, uh,
[24:11.420 --> 24:14.180]  but botanic care and general hydroponics are our biggest,
[24:14.620 --> 24:18.340]  he's definitely reliable. General hydroponics, general organics, um,
[24:18.340 --> 24:22.660]  and then mills and those pays the bills. I've seen some good shit with mills.
[24:22.780 --> 24:26.900]  I, uh, I learned some last week, some things about mills that, um,
[24:26.980 --> 24:31.300]  even this organic growers going to give them a shot. So on some indoor stuff,
[24:31.300 --> 24:33.580]  Spence was killing it with the mills. He was crushing it.
[24:33.580 --> 24:36.420]  So shout out to Spence with the mills. He's doing a good job.
[24:37.100 --> 24:41.380]  We get a bio business always bio-based, especially for like outdoor.
[24:41.580 --> 24:44.620]  Canada is a great line. If you want to spend some money. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[24:44.740 --> 24:48.700]  They're yeah. They're Dutch and they're well, well-made. Um, jungle juice is,
[24:48.700 --> 24:51.900]  that's all. Yeah. Earth juice. Earth juice. Yeah. That's what I meant. Yeah.
[24:51.900 --> 24:55.020]  Sorry. I can see the labels. I just, I haven't seen it in so long.
[24:55.020 --> 24:57.820]  I do the same thing. I really recommend if you're going to use bottled nutrients,
[24:57.820 --> 25:01.780]  I like to add humble honey. That's a good one. That's a good product. Yeah.
[25:01.780 --> 25:03.500]  It's definitely, yeah. It's got good stuff in there.
[25:03.500 --> 25:07.140]  So go to the hydro store, get yourself bottled nutrients. If you,
[25:07.220 --> 25:11.380]  if you're confused, don't buy that stuff at the hardware store. Don't buy,
[25:11.420 --> 25:13.900]  try not to buy your soil and stuff at the hardware store.
[25:13.900 --> 25:17.700]  They're a gross store somewhere. If you live somewhere, honestly,
[25:17.700 --> 25:19.860]  if you live somewhere where that shit's inaccessible,
[25:20.100 --> 25:22.020]  maybe you're better off not growing there.
[25:22.020 --> 25:24.900]  You got to have real big balls to grow in that area and shout out to you if
[25:24.900 --> 25:28.060]  you're going to do it, but we can't condone it and we can't encourage it.
[25:28.060 --> 25:31.180]  So you're only listening to this for entertainment purposes where you are.
[25:31.460 --> 25:35.300]  It's illegal, but also it's not immoral.
[25:35.380 --> 25:39.700]  So and you're probably a grown ass adult. So yeah. Yeah. Uh,
[25:39.900 --> 25:43.340]  you better be a grown ass adult listening to this podcast and iTunes and Stitcher.
[25:43.340 --> 25:47.140]  You gotta be, it's an 18 and over show. So hopefully you're an adult. Um,
[25:47.220 --> 25:50.220]  all right. We've got kind of ranty there. Um,
[25:50.220 --> 25:54.620]  so also last year in our area, we live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[25:54.620 --> 25:57.940]  This is kind of, it's not the Valley, but we are kind of in a Valley.
[25:57.940 --> 26:01.420]  We're surrounded by mountains on every side. We're in a bowl. We're in a bowl.
[26:01.420 --> 26:05.100]  That's a great way to put it. We were in the dust bowl, bro.
[26:05.100 --> 26:07.140]  There was so much wind and dirt just blowing.
[26:07.140 --> 26:11.660]  I thought my car was getting sandblasted. It was miserable. And it was cold too.
[26:11.740 --> 26:15.300]  It was weird. Yeah. Super sunshiny. Yeah. It was horrible.
[26:15.340 --> 26:19.620]  So we're in this weird bowl and we get really strange weather changes and
[26:19.620 --> 26:22.140]  drastic weather changes. It'll be today.
[26:22.140 --> 26:25.580]  I used my heater and my air conditioner both in my car. Yeah. Me too.
[26:25.700 --> 26:29.460]  Several times. Yeah. Right now it's a seven 49 in the evening.
[26:29.460 --> 26:32.020]  And I've got the front door open and two windows open.
[26:32.020 --> 26:34.340]  I thought I just heard the front doors. I said that that was really strange.
[26:34.340 --> 26:37.420]  Looking for an open window to judge what the weather was like. Right.
[26:38.540 --> 26:40.580]  But so yeah, it's the weather changes a lot here.
[26:40.580 --> 26:44.820]  My point is this caused a lot of folks to get powdery mildew last year.
[26:44.820 --> 26:46.740]  A lot of folks that grew outdoors,
[26:46.940 --> 26:48.820]  their plants were riddled with powdery mildew.
[26:48.980 --> 26:52.140]  So what I'm getting at is you've been growing outdoors for a lot of years.
[26:52.140 --> 26:54.260]  Now your dad's been growing outdoors for a hundred years.
[26:55.340 --> 26:57.660]  Shout out to the old man. What's up brother. Good to hear from you.
[26:57.660 --> 26:58.500]  I hope you're doing well.
[26:59.740 --> 27:04.620]  How do you guys go about preventing and taking care of powdery mildew outdoors?
[27:05.180 --> 27:07.620]  You know, prevention,
[27:09.940 --> 27:14.940]  planning the areas, you know, we have plenty of circulation around our plants.
[27:15.260 --> 27:17.380]  We don't cram them together. We clean the,
[27:17.420 --> 27:21.980]  we hollow them out in the middles. We clean shape the legs up. All that,
[27:22.020 --> 27:25.860]  you know, only goes so far though. You know,
[27:27.500 --> 27:29.500]  there's a few products, Azomax. I mean,
[27:29.500 --> 27:33.540]  I can't really recommend spraying anything on a bud, but if you have to,
[27:33.540 --> 27:36.700]  you have to. Azomax Green Cleaner,
[27:37.980 --> 27:41.540]  just good old H2 or H hydrogen peroxide.
[27:42.380 --> 27:47.340]  30% hydrogen peroxide diluted at about 20 to 30 mils per gallon.
[27:47.820 --> 27:50.700]  Will help keep it away, but it will not stop it.
[27:51.500 --> 27:54.700]  More organically. Teas would help.
[27:54.740 --> 27:56.500]  Like you could even brew a tea with like neem.
[27:56.580 --> 27:59.540]  I think Sean would tell you to brew a nice compost tea with some Karanja and
[27:59.540 --> 28:00.380]  neem in there.
[28:02.020 --> 28:05.860]  I think you're going to want to fungus domino to battle OPM.
[28:06.540 --> 28:08.660]  That'll disrupt the pH on the surface of the leaves.
[28:10.220 --> 28:14.260]  And then like there's some, some plant teas you can make.
[28:14.260 --> 28:17.700]  I've been experimenting with Chamomile,
[28:18.340 --> 28:21.220]  which is, it's a natural herb.
[28:21.900 --> 28:26.300]  You find it in a lot of like tea blends for like drinking like hot tea.
[28:27.540 --> 28:29.900]  It's considered a weed in most of the world.
[28:30.500 --> 28:32.740]  It grows naturally here in Colorado.
[28:34.020 --> 28:36.380]  So I'll be able to wild craft it in the fall.
[28:36.780 --> 28:41.780]  I've just been buying it from the health food store right now, but it's a natural
[28:42.420 --> 28:44.620]  antifungal and anti,
[28:47.660 --> 28:49.580]  microbial antifungal.
[28:49.660 --> 28:51.220]  I'm not sure if that's where you want, but it sounds good.
[28:51.460 --> 28:53.060]  Yeah. Okay. Bacterial. That's what it is.
[28:53.100 --> 28:54.220]  Okay. Antibacterial.
[28:54.620 --> 28:59.620]  So I believe it makes a tea that has a higher pH was another thing I heard.
[28:59.820 --> 29:04.820]  But with those, you know, two properties it battles PM pretty good.
[29:05.980 --> 29:10.980]  It looks like. So and then also added benefit of it is it's high pH.
[29:11.780 --> 29:14.780]  It's high in P and K. So that's just another,
[29:14.900 --> 29:16.420]  you're going to help that increase trichomes.
[29:16.460 --> 29:19.260]  Yeah, that's I'm actually right now at my current run.
[29:19.380 --> 29:22.900]  I gave half my Yeti OG plants, a teammate of this.
[29:24.300 --> 29:29.300]  I'm week five right now. I think I gave half of them a team made of that.
[29:32.100 --> 29:36.140]  And then I gave up the other half for that feeding. They just got water.
[29:36.220 --> 29:38.900]  So now I'm kind of kicking back, seeing what's happening.
[29:38.900 --> 29:41.380]  I'm going to wait and see what does what. That's always a good thing to do.
[29:42.660 --> 29:45.260]  How do you feel about, is it Osa 28?
[29:47.420 --> 29:49.220]  That seems like a really great, yeah. Yeah.
[29:49.860 --> 29:52.220]  I get the numbers mixed up. There's so many numbers.
[29:52.260 --> 29:53.980]  Potassium silicate, I think.
[29:53.980 --> 29:54.260]  Yes.
[29:54.260 --> 29:54.620]  Something like that.
[29:54.620 --> 29:55.060]  Yes.
[29:56.380 --> 29:59.340]  A lot of growers I really respect are preaching it.
[30:00.220 --> 30:05.220]  I haven't used it personally yet, so, but it's a different kind of silica.
[30:05.260 --> 30:05.820]  So.
[30:05.900 --> 30:10.900]  And if you mix it in with almost any of your store bought foliar feeds, it really
[30:11.900 --> 30:14.420]  increases the effectiveness of both products. I think.
[30:14.420 --> 30:15.460]  Nice. I can see that.
[30:17.020 --> 30:18.220]  Sometimes we,
[30:18.260 --> 30:22.300]  I've used it in conjunction with my integrated pest management system and my
[30:22.300 --> 30:25.260]  plants love it. It kind of helps the, uh, the,
[30:25.260 --> 30:27.580]  whatever you're putting on the plants, it helps it stick a little better.
[30:27.580 --> 30:30.660]  I think too. It works like a sticker spreader a little bit. It kind of,
[30:30.700 --> 30:34.180]  it's got the consistency of dish soap almost when you open up the bottle.
[30:34.300 --> 30:36.500]  I always stick my finger in shit. I know I'm not supposed to,
[30:36.500 --> 30:39.540]  but I want to know. I'm like, what is this? Like I smell it and play with it.
[30:39.700 --> 30:40.620]  Almost taste it.
[30:40.900 --> 30:41.780]  Sometimes I want to,
[30:42.700 --> 30:45.980]  soul synthetics make some products that I would drink.
[30:46.460 --> 30:47.820]  If you served me a cup of like,
[30:47.820 --> 30:50.620]  if I went to the Montay factor and they handed me that, but that's fucking
[30:51.820 --> 30:56.060]  what is this? It's soul synthetics, nitrogen blend. Let's get it on, bro.
[30:58.740 --> 31:01.700]  What is it? A nectar for the gods smells kind of good too. Yeah.
[31:01.740 --> 31:04.420]  Yeah. Kind of very similar to soul synthetics.
[31:05.020 --> 31:08.380]  And it was a soul synthetics and another brand that I got some samples of,
[31:08.380 --> 31:12.020]  but there's a bunch of molasses in one of them and it just smelled so yummy.
[31:12.020 --> 31:13.180]  I was like, Oh, I can drink this.
[31:13.660 --> 31:16.580]  Humic acid and molasses together just give me this yummy flavor.
[31:16.740 --> 31:18.460]  Speaking of that full power,
[31:18.460 --> 31:23.020]  you actually can drink and it's actually good for you. Yeah. It's a,
[31:23.060 --> 31:27.580]  it's a human can fulvic. They have to label it as humic acid,
[31:27.580 --> 31:31.620]  but it's actually fulvic acid that has something to do with labeling laws. But,
[31:31.620 --> 31:36.660]  um, uh, yeah, there's no warning on it. There's no real MSDS for it.
[31:36.860 --> 31:40.740]  So as I've heard, uh, Jeremy from build a soil, talk about drinking it too.
[31:40.780 --> 31:43.900]  That's what kind of got me to research. I was like, this guy's nuts.
[31:44.700 --> 31:48.180]  He is nuts, but he's got a lot of great ideas. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean,
[31:48.180 --> 31:51.260]  I'm pretty, you know, he seems like a guy concerned about what's going into his
[31:51.260 --> 31:55.500]  body. So, uh, most of the dragonfly earth medicine products are guaranteed.
[31:55.660 --> 31:59.780]  Yeah. That's mostly just alfalfa and what? Yeah. Such good stuff.
[31:59.900 --> 32:02.340]  If you need roots, uh, use that lush roots.
[32:02.340 --> 32:05.500]  Just take your little baby clones where the roots are showing and just roll the
[32:05.500 --> 32:08.620]  clones in that lush roots and then put them into soil and they'll just,
[32:08.740 --> 32:10.060]  there'll be root bound the next day.
[32:12.460 --> 32:14.140]  Fat flowers is a good one too. Okay.
[32:14.580 --> 32:18.980]  I've run too big of a crop for the price of most definitely. Yeah.
[32:19.020 --> 32:21.540]  That's a for a boutique grower for sure. Yeah.
[32:21.580 --> 32:23.500]  That's for three lights or less or something.
[32:23.540 --> 32:27.860]  Insect frass is amazing, but we could never use it at either one of our works.
[32:27.900 --> 32:31.940]  Cause it's just, it's the, the price it would take to make, you know,
[32:31.980 --> 32:35.060]  300 gallons once a week of this shit is ridiculous.
[32:36.340 --> 32:39.260]  I kind of want to give a shout out to a product, but I'm not sure. Yeah,
[32:39.260 --> 32:43.140]  let's go for it. A big time exterminator. Uh, it seems to be working.
[32:43.180 --> 32:46.020]  That's all I've got to say about that. Big time exterminator.
[32:46.020 --> 32:48.860]  This comes in a black bottle with a skull on it and this is big time
[32:48.860 --> 32:51.180]  exterminator on it. And it's pretty rad. Uh,
[32:51.180 --> 32:54.740]  it's mostly organic and it's approved by the MED rules,
[32:54.860 --> 32:58.580]  which is very important. Very important. And I feel like, uh,
[32:58.580 --> 33:02.860]  I've been adapting. I run a personal home grow, a caregiver grow for my patients,
[33:02.860 --> 33:05.940]  which is all legal and legit and I can do whatever I want. There's no,
[33:05.980 --> 33:10.260]  nobody looks at it, but I adapted the same MED rules to my personal grow.
[33:10.420 --> 33:13.820]  I kind of like if they don't allow it there, then I got to throw it away.
[33:13.820 --> 33:17.500]  Also, there's no need for me to, and it keeps me learning here also. Yeah.
[33:17.820 --> 33:21.460]  And there, it keeps me prepared for both places. Uh, my wife, Bernadette,
[33:22.260 --> 33:25.580]  my wife, my wife, she's, uh, um,
[33:26.060 --> 33:29.500]  been a studying that list very good and getting to know pesticides.
[33:29.500 --> 33:32.460]  I'm actually really proud of her. Good. Shout out to burn.
[33:32.500 --> 33:37.060]  She has head growers from some of our clients calling her and asking her about
[33:37.060 --> 33:39.300]  stuff and what they can use and what they can't use.
[33:39.500 --> 33:43.060]  Cause she knows more about it than the head grower for these gigantic grows.
[33:43.620 --> 33:47.460]  Uh, so email out lists to everybody in metric. Oh yeah.
[33:47.460 --> 33:50.860]  You get a list of all the new pesticides and all that stuff changes.
[33:51.500 --> 33:55.780]  I read it. I read it often. I have to. Yeah. Yeah. That's she's actually, uh,
[33:55.900 --> 33:59.380]  she tried calling the MED to talk to him about it one day. And, um,
[34:00.020 --> 34:05.020]  a certain lady with her name starts with an M called her back and was not cool at
[34:06.020 --> 34:07.540]  all. Um,
[34:07.660 --> 34:11.260]  but then we called the department agriculture and she ended up spending about
[34:11.260 --> 34:13.500]  an hour on the phone with the lady. Those guys are super cool.
[34:13.660 --> 34:15.180]  The department of ag is really cool.
[34:15.300 --> 34:18.340]  I hope they're the people that actually regulate us one day.
[34:18.860 --> 34:20.340]  That's one of my hopes and dreams.
[34:20.420 --> 34:23.620]  Gary had some great points on the show that we recorded last night that hasn't
[34:23.620 --> 34:26.260]  been released yet. Everybody that listens to the show has heard it by now,
[34:26.260 --> 34:26.940]  but, and you'll hear it,
[34:26.940 --> 34:29.340]  but there's some great things that kind of go along with that statement.
[34:29.660 --> 34:33.060]  It'll be entertaining. So a powdery mildew, um,
[34:33.820 --> 34:36.260]  how the hell are we getting rid of that? Remind me again. Oh,
[34:36.260 --> 34:41.060]  we're mixing up some spray. Yeah. Chamomile, chamomile tea all over the plants.
[34:41.460 --> 34:43.860]  It'll disrupt the pH. Okay. I want to make sure that we covered that one.
[34:43.980 --> 34:47.260]  I bet. Uh, adding some silica to that tea to help raise the pH even more.
[34:47.260 --> 34:50.420]  Yeah. Maybe, maybe be real killer. Big time exterminator with some, uh,
[34:50.460 --> 34:54.660]  Osa 28 in there. Yeah. It would be really, really effective on PM is what I would
[34:54.700 --> 34:57.700]  assume. I'm going to have to try the big time exterminator.
[34:57.740 --> 35:00.900]  We have it at the store, but I've never used it. So yeah. Cool.
[35:00.900 --> 35:03.820]  I didn't know that. So now I know that knowing is flying school.
[35:03.860 --> 35:05.300]  We have another one of their products too.
[35:06.220 --> 35:09.940]  The enzyme big time enzyme, big time roots, big time. Ignaculate. Yeah.
[35:09.940 --> 35:12.500]  That's one of those. They got, they should see the store.
[35:12.580 --> 35:15.100]  They just got a good shout out. Those are good products. I like the big time.
[35:15.100 --> 35:17.140]  There's one with coconut oil and some other things in it.
[35:17.140 --> 35:20.980]  I really approve of that one. Nice. Nice. All right. So if you guys do,
[35:20.980 --> 35:24.780]  here's another side note. If you do have buds that have powdery mildew on them,
[35:25.500 --> 35:27.020]  I know it sounds like the easy way out.
[35:27.180 --> 35:31.780]  Do not blast them and turn them into BHO. Please. Please don't do that.
[35:31.780 --> 35:33.540]  Don't press them and turn them into Rosin.
[35:33.860 --> 35:36.460]  We don't want to taste your burnt popcorn and powdery mildew.
[35:38.340 --> 35:40.820]  I haven't seen any, uh, powdery mildew Rosin yet.
[35:41.740 --> 35:44.300]  It's going to happen though. Eventually it's coming. Uh,
[35:44.300 --> 35:47.700]  I made a joke the other day. I said, well, since everybody learned how to make BHO,
[35:47.700 --> 35:49.340]  nobody gets powdery mildew anymore.
[35:51.300 --> 35:53.260]  It's a sick truth. You never see it. Nobody's like,
[35:53.260 --> 35:55.740]  I lost a whole crop to PM or yeah, we got PM. It's like, no,
[35:55.740 --> 35:58.620]  we have a whole bunch of shatter. That's what you see now.
[35:58.740 --> 36:03.340]  I know a few people, they think it's safe. Yeah. And it's not. Um, I can, okay,
[36:04.060 --> 36:07.380]  here's, I'm not a scientist. I'm not a chemistry student. I'm not, this is,
[36:07.380 --> 36:08.900]  I'm not qualified to give this speech,
[36:08.900 --> 36:13.380]  but this is what I understand about the idea of blasting powdery mildew covered
[36:13.380 --> 36:14.620]  buds. Uh,
[36:15.580 --> 36:19.100]  some folks say that the PM will not get through the screen good enough.
[36:19.100 --> 36:21.340]  If it doesn't, maybe it won't, maybe it'll stay in the tube.
[36:21.340 --> 36:23.220]  Maybe it's right there pressed up against the screen,
[36:23.220 --> 36:25.700]  just like your coffee and it's not getting through and only the coffee's coming
[36:25.700 --> 36:30.180]  through. But what is coming through, maybe not the spores and not the mildew,
[36:30.180 --> 36:33.540]  but there are mycotoxins inside of those spores that have been extracted,
[36:33.540 --> 36:36.580]  just like your cannabinoids and your terpenes they've been washed off.
[36:36.580 --> 36:38.020]  So you're getting the mycotoxins,
[36:38.020 --> 36:43.020]  which are going to affect you in the long run. If you, if you inhale the spores,
[36:43.860 --> 36:46.220]  you'll get that sooner. You'll get an infection in your lungs.
[36:46.220 --> 36:47.220]  You'll get an irritation.
[36:47.580 --> 36:50.900]  The mycotoxins are going to take a little while to infect your body and it's
[36:50.900 --> 36:52.860]  going to be different. You're going to have fungus inside your body.
[36:52.860 --> 36:54.900]  You got mycotoxins running around inside your lungs.
[36:54.900 --> 36:57.780]  Now they're going to get in your bloodstream. I'm not a doctor.
[36:57.820 --> 36:59.140]  I don't know enough about that,
[36:59.500 --> 37:02.940]  but I do know that it's not a good idea because you're just washing the
[37:02.940 --> 37:05.180]  mycotoxins off the mildew into your hash.
[37:05.700 --> 37:08.460]  And then people are going to make edibles out of that hash sometimes and they're
[37:08.460 --> 37:11.180]  going to consume and eat that shit and they're going to smoke it.
[37:11.180 --> 37:13.860]  And this is supposed to be something that improves the quality of people's lives,
[37:13.860 --> 37:16.100]  not makes us sicker, not fucks us up.
[37:16.100 --> 37:18.700]  So please do not blast your powdery mildew buds.
[37:18.700 --> 37:22.220]  The only thing that I recommend, I've never done this, uh,
[37:22.380 --> 37:24.260]  shout out to Sean and Jordan. That's all there.
[37:24.260 --> 37:27.140]  I don't know what else to call him. Sean and Jordan, some friends of mine,
[37:27.180 --> 37:29.700]  they say that you can take, um,
[37:30.420 --> 37:35.420]  the 30% hydrogen peroxide and put it in distilled water and you can mix
[37:35.420 --> 37:35.780]  that up.
[37:35.780 --> 37:40.700]  And they say you can dunk your PM covered buds or PM dosed
[37:40.700 --> 37:43.100]  buds in that and then hang them up and they will dry.
[37:43.300 --> 37:45.300]  And that will cure your powdery mildew problem.
[37:46.260 --> 37:49.820]  Yeah, I've heard that. I'm skeptical. I don't know that I can recommend that.
[37:49.820 --> 37:52.860]  If anybody has done that, email me, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[37:52.860 --> 37:56.900]  I'd love to hear what your experience about that with that on that subject. Um,
[37:57.940 --> 38:00.820]  I've heard that you can wash your buds the exact same way,
[38:00.820 --> 38:04.340]  like your outdoor buds to wash the dirts and stuff off of them. Yeah.
[38:04.500 --> 38:08.420]  Doing that exact same thing. Uh, but without the hydrogen peroxide,
[38:08.500 --> 38:12.340]  just water. So if anyone's done that, let Jeff know about that too.
[38:12.860 --> 38:13.820]  Cause I'd like to hear.
[38:13.900 --> 38:17.580]  I had a friend named Donovan who was known as DJ dinky online back in the day.
[38:17.860 --> 38:20.980]  He, I don't know if I supposed to say his real name and his online name that
[38:20.980 --> 38:23.220]  doesn't exist anymore. So we're cool. Um,
[38:23.340 --> 38:26.540]  he used to say that he would rinse his buds off just like a week before
[38:26.540 --> 38:27.220]  harvest. He's like,
[38:27.220 --> 38:29.820]  I'd just go in there and rinse them off with a spray bottle and hose them down
[38:29.820 --> 38:34.060]  just to get all the dust off of them, which is a good idea because in my opinion,
[38:34.060 --> 38:36.460]  all that dust that you kick up during the grow season,
[38:36.780 --> 38:39.780]  it's been windy as shit out here. People got plants out.
[38:39.780 --> 38:42.500]  If it's this windy in the middle of the flowering season,
[38:42.500 --> 38:45.460]  people are going to have buds that are just covered in dirt on one side.
[38:46.740 --> 38:47.980]  That's going into your hash.
[38:48.340 --> 38:51.060]  You're just going to blast that right into the pot of gold right there.
[38:52.500 --> 38:54.300]  Dirt extract is going to taste like earth.
[38:55.340 --> 38:57.700]  Maybe cleaning off the buds is a good idea in this region.
[38:58.660 --> 39:00.020]  I'm going to try it this summer.
[39:00.100 --> 39:02.700]  It sounds lazy, but in my personal grow room,
[39:02.740 --> 39:06.820]  I quit sweeping around week six. Uh, the buds are getting sticky.
[39:06.860 --> 39:11.860]  Everything's real sticky and I don't want to stir up any dust or dirt off of the
[39:11.980 --> 39:16.060]  floor into those buds. So I will let it get kind of funky from about week.
[39:16.220 --> 39:17.740]  I mean there's not a lot of shit on the floor.
[39:17.740 --> 39:19.460]  I'm not in there eating snacks or anything,
[39:19.460 --> 39:23.620]  but there are leaves and you spill soil when you kick pots occasionally and shit
[39:23.620 --> 39:24.460]  happens.
[39:24.460 --> 39:28.420]  But I won't sweep sometimes from like week six or seven until after harvest or
[39:28.420 --> 39:32.020]  at the end of harvest, I'll cut off all the leaves pre-harvest and then sweep up.
[39:32.020 --> 39:34.100]  And it is pretty much the same thing.
[39:34.500 --> 39:37.340]  Cut down the plants pre-harvest, cut down the plants and then sweep up and clean
[39:37.340 --> 39:38.380]  up. Start fresh.
[39:38.780 --> 39:42.220]  Spray the whole room with hydrogen peroxide water and fucking clean it up.
[39:42.820 --> 39:46.500]  We bomb it. Yeah. Bomb it, clean it up, redo the flooring, fix all the ducting.
[39:47.220 --> 39:49.220]  That should be a whole episode. What to do between grows.
[39:49.220 --> 39:51.540]  We could probably talk for six weeks about that. Oh yeah.
[39:54.380 --> 39:58.220]  Untouched subject a lot. So yeah. So we've been going for about 40 minutes, dude.
[39:58.220 --> 40:00.700]  I think we gave the folks a decent start.
[40:00.700 --> 40:02.380]  All we did was tell them how to mix up some soil.
[40:02.380 --> 40:05.540]  So dig some big holes and put all that stuff inside of it and then put your
[40:05.540 --> 40:10.540]  little baby plants in there about May 15th to June 5th ish.
[40:10.860 --> 40:13.420]  Yeah. And then keep an eye on them. Keep them watered decently.
[40:13.660 --> 40:18.060]  Just real quick. Do your soil at least two weeks before.
[40:18.820 --> 40:20.540]  Cover the top of the hole with plastic.
[40:20.580 --> 40:28.580]  That helps accelerate the composting process of the raw amendments being broken
[40:28.580 --> 40:29.940]  down and being plant available.
[40:30.420 --> 40:34.700]  Earthworms are great. Yeah.
[40:34.700 --> 40:37.300]  Throw some worms in there if you can. Mulching is awesome.
[40:38.180 --> 40:42.420]  Your hole size do, you know, it kind of depends on, you know, the size of your
[40:42.420 --> 40:47.060]  plant and how big it can get, but at least three by three hole.
[40:48.100 --> 40:50.140]  And you only need to go with cannabis.
[40:50.140 --> 40:51.980]  You only need to go down about 18 inches.
[40:52.340 --> 40:56.940]  There's no need to try to fill a fucking six foot hole full of highly enriched
[40:56.940 --> 40:59.100]  soil. I think it's expensive.
[40:59.100 --> 40:59.700]  Quickly. Yeah.
[40:59.700 --> 41:01.860]  It's just a lot of work and it gets really expensive.
[41:01.940 --> 41:04.580]  So go get you some bales of pro mix.
[41:05.060 --> 41:06.260]  Yeah. It's a good start.
[41:06.780 --> 41:08.420]  Dude. Thanks for coming and being on the podcast.
[41:08.460 --> 41:09.420]  For sure. For sure.
[41:09.580 --> 41:11.660]  Tell everybody how they can follow you on social media.
[41:11.820 --> 41:13.580]  Yeah. Can I shout out mine?
[41:13.660 --> 41:14.060]  Yeah, dude.
[41:14.060 --> 41:14.380]  Shout it out.
[41:14.380 --> 41:14.780]  For sure.
[41:15.780 --> 41:19.300]  You can follow me on Instagram at Jesse Grows.
[41:21.220 --> 41:25.100]  You can hit me up on Facebook if you know how to do that.
[41:27.020 --> 41:33.420]  And you can also check out my podcast that I would have never started without being on
[41:33.420 --> 41:35.140]  Jeff's show. So thank you, bro.
[41:35.220 --> 41:38.820]  A lot of and he's already taught me a lot and everything.
[41:38.860 --> 41:47.700]  But it's the Colorado podcast that's C O L O R A D O P E podcast.
[41:48.620 --> 41:53.500]  Right now we're just on SoundCloud and then we're also on Facebook as the same thing.
[41:53.660 --> 41:58.420]  And our email is Colorado420podcast at gmail.com.
[41:58.580 --> 42:01.020]  What do you guys talk about on the Colorado podcast?
[42:01.780 --> 42:04.060]  Cannabis lifestyle.
[42:04.060 --> 42:07.140]  One of the other hosts is 44.
[42:07.180 --> 42:09.260]  So he has his special little flavor.
[42:09.260 --> 42:10.420]  Shout out to 44.
[42:10.580 --> 42:12.220]  And then our other host.
[42:12.220 --> 42:13.500]  We call him 44 and 2 now.
[42:14.820 --> 42:16.060]  I tried calling him 45.
[42:16.060 --> 42:17.260]  He didn't think that was too funny.
[42:19.060 --> 42:19.340]  Yeah.
[42:21.420 --> 42:22.140]  We still love you, bro.
[42:22.140 --> 42:22.820]  You're still on the team.
[42:22.820 --> 42:23.140]  Don't worry.
[42:23.380 --> 42:30.100]  And then my good lifelong friend, Despicable Derek, or Dink Derek, whatever you want to call him.
[42:30.140 --> 42:30.820]  Dirty Derek.
[42:30.900 --> 42:32.620]  He is pretty involved.
[42:32.660 --> 42:33.340]  Is that Fish?
[42:33.860 --> 42:34.100]  Yeah.
[42:34.180 --> 42:34.340]  Yeah.
[42:34.500 --> 42:35.020]  Fish.
[42:35.060 --> 42:35.300]  Yeah.
[42:35.380 --> 42:35.660]  Fish.
[42:35.660 --> 42:37.020]  I haven't heard him called Fish in a long time.
[42:37.020 --> 42:37.900]  Fish number two.
[42:38.020 --> 42:38.540]  Oh.
[42:39.300 --> 42:41.500]  All of us that have known him a long time know his cousin too.
[42:42.380 --> 42:43.700]  We all met the cousin first.
[42:43.700 --> 42:44.620]  So that's Fish number one.
[42:44.620 --> 42:45.020]  Ah.
[42:45.180 --> 42:45.420]  Yeah.
[42:45.540 --> 42:46.340]  It's backup Fish.
[42:46.380 --> 42:46.580]  Yep.
[42:47.660 --> 42:52.540]  But he's real active in the local hip hop and music scene.
[42:52.540 --> 42:54.060]  So he adds that to it.
[42:54.580 --> 42:59.460]  And we are quite a bit more unorthodox than Jeff's very professional show.
[42:59.660 --> 43:03.580]  So we cuss and talk about a few gross things and shit.
[43:03.780 --> 43:04.900]  Oh, we've done that on this show.
[43:04.940 --> 43:05.340]  Oh yeah.
[43:05.660 --> 43:06.420]  We've done that here.
[43:06.580 --> 43:06.780]  Yeah.
[43:06.820 --> 43:07.900]  44 has been on this show.
[43:07.940 --> 43:08.180]  Yeah.
[43:08.380 --> 43:08.660]  True.
[43:08.660 --> 43:08.940]  True.
[43:09.020 --> 43:11.580]  I remember a moose knuckle episode or something.
[43:12.540 --> 43:13.580]  Clint's been here also.
[43:13.740 --> 43:14.020]  True.
[43:14.020 --> 43:14.260]  True.
[43:14.260 --> 43:14.620]  Yeah.
[43:14.700 --> 43:15.340]  Shout out to Clint.
[43:15.340 --> 43:16.580]  I hope you listen to the podcast, bro.
[43:16.580 --> 43:17.860]  If you do message me and let me know.
[43:17.940 --> 43:18.620]  We got to get together.
[43:18.620 --> 43:19.980]  He left something here last time you were here.
[43:20.380 --> 43:20.740]  Uh oh.

[43:22.740 --> 43:26.020]  Oh, stole it from me.
[43:26.740 --> 43:28.380]  I think we're going to wrap up the show on that note.
[43:28.700 --> 43:30.500]  Uh, dude, thanks for coming and taking an hour out of your day.
[43:30.500 --> 43:31.700]  We're going to take some dabs before you leave.

[43:33.100 --> 43:34.180]  Oh yeah.
[43:34.260 --> 43:37.860]  Um, if anybody out there is interested in sponsoring a podcast or if you'd like a
[43:37.860 --> 43:40.060]  product or if you've got a product you'd like us to review, I don't have any
[43:40.060 --> 43:41.380]  paperwork to read off of them going.
[43:41.380 --> 43:42.220]  No script lately.

[43:47.700 --> 43:49.940]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review, I will not talk about free
[43:49.980 --> 43:53.060]  balling in the advertisement of your product or as I review your product.
[43:53.060 --> 43:55.660]  But if you've got a product you'd like me to review, or if you'd like to
