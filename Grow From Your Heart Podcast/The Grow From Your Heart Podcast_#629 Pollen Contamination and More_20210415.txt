[00:00.000 --> 00:09.260]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world, I'm your host my friends call me Rasta Jeff and this
[00:09.260 --> 00:13.800]  is episode 628 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:13.800 --> 00:17.000]  In this episode I'm going to read a couple of Patreon messages.
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.120]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[00:21.120 --> 00:25.960]  Of course the 710 club are those folks who support us on Patreon at the $7 and 10 cent
[00:25.960 --> 00:27.680]  a month level or higher.
[00:27.680 --> 00:31.480]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big grow from your heart podcast thank
[00:31.480 --> 00:34.320]  you shout out to my good friend Glen Geroni.
[00:34.320 --> 00:37.280]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Carl W and the Canna Crat.
[00:37.280 --> 00:40.300]  Let's send a big thank you to Guy Yudy Grose and Tyler Filth.
[00:40.300 --> 00:43.080]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Xavier and Zach C.
[00:43.080 --> 00:45.740]  Let's send a big thank you to Grow Meds for life.
[00:45.740 --> 00:48.640]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my friend Maverick.
[00:48.640 --> 00:51.600]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Hash Slinging Dabber.
[00:51.600 --> 00:55.160]  And then let's wrap it up with the big grow from your heart podcast thank you shout out
[00:55.240 --> 00:59.000]  to my friend Buzzards Bay Buds.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.360]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:03.360 --> 01:06.880]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:06.880 --> 01:13.320]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.760]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.040]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:20.040 --> 01:23.240]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.040]  I haven't been talking about what I'm dabbing at the start of the show but I am extra fast
[01:28.040 --> 01:29.040]  today.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.040]  I feel like I'm going super fast.
[01:30.040 --> 01:31.040]  I feel like I'm kind of rambly.
[01:31.040 --> 01:34.480]  So I'm going to mention that I'm dabbing something called Dirty Business from Green
[01:34.480 --> 01:35.560]  Dot Labs.
[01:35.560 --> 01:38.080]  It's a sour diesel and OG kush cross.
[01:38.080 --> 01:41.080]  I don't have the jar here next to me to give you the full details.
[01:41.080 --> 01:44.960]  But I do know I'm all fucked up from it and it's delicious and I enjoy it.
[01:44.960 --> 01:48.120]  So you're going to have to deal with me going a little bit fast and a little bit rambly
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.420]  in this episode.
[01:49.420 --> 01:51.880]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:52.320 --> 01:53.320]  Alright let's do some updates.
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.400]  In a previous episode I did talk about auto watering.
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.480]  When I did the auto watering system I kind of overlooked a couple of details.
[02:01.480 --> 02:07.000]  I forgot to mention Auto Pots and Hempi Buckets and Sips systems.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.760]  These are very affordable and very simple ways to auto water our plants.
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.760]  They're gravity fed.
[02:12.760 --> 02:15.760]  You don't need any timers, any buttons, any magic.
[02:15.760 --> 02:17.840]  It is gravity fed like I said before.
[02:17.840 --> 02:21.960]  So if you want an easier system that I completely fucking overlooked, did not think about until
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.000]  my kind friends reminded me, do a little research on Auto Pots.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.140]  The Auto Pot system is great.
[02:28.140 --> 02:32.340]  You fill up one reservoir, run some lines to other pots.
[02:32.340 --> 02:35.720]  They work on a, it's kind of a, I can't even think of the word right now.
[02:35.720 --> 02:36.720]  It's like a capillary system.
[02:36.720 --> 02:41.080]  It knows how moist the medium is and if it needs more water it gives it more water.
[02:41.080 --> 02:43.040]  If it doesn't it turns it off.
[02:43.040 --> 02:45.720]  The Hempi Buckets kind of work on a similar method.
[02:45.720 --> 02:50.880]  These are what are known as Sips systems, sub irrigation planning systems.
[02:50.880 --> 02:51.880]  I think that's what it is.
[02:51.880 --> 02:54.640]  Sub sub subterranean irrigation.
[02:54.640 --> 02:58.920]  You guys, obviously this is not my field of expertise, but I had to remind you about it.
[02:58.920 --> 02:59.960]  Had to tell you about it.
[02:59.960 --> 03:03.960]  If you're looking to build your auto watering system, looking for an affordable route and
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.440]  affordable alternative, something very easy to do, something gravity fed, something very
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.880]  reliable, look into the Hempi Buckets, the Auto Pots, something in that realm.
[03:12.880 --> 03:15.640]  A Sips system is what you're looking for.
[03:15.680 --> 03:17.600]  All right, that was my update on that.
[03:17.600 --> 03:18.760]  What else did I want to talk about?
[03:18.760 --> 03:23.120]  You guys, I've been scrolling social media when I'm chilling out trying to relax a little
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.120]  bit.
[03:24.120 --> 03:26.760]  I scroll just like you and I've been seeing a lot of great things on social media.
[03:26.760 --> 03:28.960]  I've also been seeing a lot of bullshit.
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.160]  One thing that drives me crazy is I see a lot of grow rooms, a lot of grow tents, a
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.400]  lot of grow environments that simply are wasting a ton of space.
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.280]  If you've got a five by five grow tent, I would like to see at least four by four worth
[03:40.280 --> 03:41.280]  of herb in there.
[03:41.280 --> 03:42.280]  We don't need three by three.
[03:42.280 --> 03:46.720]  We don't need one plant in a five by five, one plant over here, one plant over here.
[03:46.720 --> 03:49.800]  Let's put those right under the center of the light, get them as much light as we can
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.600]  possibly get them, spoil those two plants or even better, let's fill the room.
[03:54.600 --> 03:59.120]  You guys, a lot of places growing cannabis is illegal and you're growing and you're setting
[03:59.120 --> 04:03.120]  up a five by five, you're paying for electricity, you're going in, you're paying for the lights,
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.880]  you're paying for the electricity, you're losing, you're using your time, your manpower.
[04:07.880 --> 04:09.280]  Also you're committing a crime.
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.200]  If you're going to commit a fucking felony, go in, fill that fucking room.
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.120]  Don't commit a felony for a little couple of nugs, commit a fucking felony for a rewarding
[04:18.120 --> 04:19.880]  fucking prize at the end, you guys.
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.680]  So what I'm saying is I see a five by five tent with like one plant over here and one
[04:23.680 --> 04:24.880]  plant over here.
[04:24.880 --> 04:27.240]  The shit's a disorganized, chaotic mess.
[04:27.240 --> 04:30.280]  Have a strategy, have a plan, fill your five by five.
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.400]  If you've got a five by five canopy, a five by five tent, I'd like to see a five by five
[04:34.400 --> 04:35.400]  canopy in there.
[04:35.400 --> 04:38.160]  My tents, when I unzip the tent, it just busts out.
[04:38.160 --> 04:40.800]  It looks like a seventies bush busting out of a bikini.
[04:40.800 --> 04:42.240]  It's ridiculous when I open the tent.
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.440]  That's what I like to see from you.
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.280]  So think about how to fill that tent, maximize your space.
[04:47.280 --> 04:51.360]  Let's not get a five by five tent and put three plants in there and have one super tall,
[04:51.360 --> 04:53.920]  one super short, one not even under the fucking light.
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.200]  Think about what you're doing.
[04:55.200 --> 04:59.160]  You're using the lights, you're using the space, you're using the electricity, the soil,
[04:59.160 --> 05:01.560]  all of that costs money, time, energy.
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.920]  And like I said before, you're possibly committing a crime.
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.160]  If you're going to commit a crime, make it fucking worth it.
[05:07.160 --> 05:08.160]  Felonies are not free.
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.160]  That's what we used to say.
[05:09.160 --> 05:11.920]  Don't do your own felonies for free for yourself either.
[05:11.920 --> 05:12.920]  All right.
[05:12.920 --> 05:14.280]  I just wanted to say, fill your space.
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.120]  If I gave you a cooler and I was like, here's a box, it's three feet by three feet by three
[05:18.120 --> 05:19.120]  feet.
[05:19.120 --> 05:20.560]  You can put as much weed in there as you want.
[05:20.560 --> 05:22.600]  Are you going to put two feet by two feet worth of weed?
[05:22.600 --> 05:26.040]  Are you going to put fucking three by three by three worth of weed in that bitch?
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.040]  You're going to fill it up, right?
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.160]  If I said, fill it up with cookies or beer, weed, whatever you want, you're going to stack
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.160]  that bitch up.
[05:32.160 --> 05:33.560]  You're not going to just stack the middle of it.
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.840]  Put a couple over here, a couple over here.
[05:35.840 --> 05:36.920]  That is not efficient.
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.880]  I'm a commercial cannabis cultivator.
[05:38.880 --> 05:41.800]  I'm all about efficiency, productivity.
[05:41.800 --> 05:44.600]  And then also I'm a drummer, so I'm used to packing the car.
[05:44.600 --> 05:47.480]  If there's a space, put some shit in that space, dude.
[05:47.480 --> 05:48.480]  All right.
[05:48.480 --> 05:50.920]  That's enough ranting about space and wasted space in your grow tents.
[05:50.920 --> 05:52.160]  I see it a lot on social media.
[05:52.160 --> 05:53.160]  It drives me crazy.
[05:53.160 --> 05:54.320]  Organize your tent.
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.520]  What the hell are you guys doing?
[05:55.520 --> 05:57.040]  Get in there and clean that shit up.
[05:57.040 --> 05:59.320]  If you're going to commit a crime, fucking commit a crime.
[05:59.320 --> 06:00.320]  All right.
[06:00.320 --> 06:03.160]  That is enough of the rambling intro part of the podcast.
[06:03.160 --> 06:06.920]  I do have a couple of messages here that are going to get me rambling on a focused
[06:06.920 --> 06:07.920]  subject.
[06:07.920 --> 06:10.280]  I told you guys those dabs of that dirty business.
[06:10.280 --> 06:11.800]  I think that's what it's called, dirty business.
[06:11.800 --> 06:13.160]  That shit got me high as shit.
[06:13.160 --> 06:14.160]  I'm talkative.
[06:14.160 --> 06:16.880]  I'm rambly, but that is good for a podcast.
[06:16.880 --> 06:18.300]  This one comes from Patreon.
[06:18.300 --> 06:21.760]  Before we go too far on Patreon, let's give a shout out to my buddy, Saint Skinny and
[06:21.760 --> 06:24.300]  Mama Skinny for supporting us on Patreon.
[06:24.300 --> 06:29.840]  Also for being long time cannabis and Patreon and Grow From Your Heart, IRE Army supporters.
[06:29.840 --> 06:32.520]  They've been on the team for a long time, been showing love for a long time.
[06:32.880 --> 06:37.400]  Big shout out to Saint Skinny and Mama Skinny, Mama Saint, however you want it to go.
[06:37.400 --> 06:39.840]  This is how the first question from Patreon goes.
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.720]  This one says, Rasta Jeff, get your lab coat.
[06:42.720 --> 06:47.200]  Then it says, what are the chances that an industrial hemp farm would potentially pollinate
[06:47.200 --> 06:49.080]  an outdoor cannabis grow?
[06:49.080 --> 06:50.080]  Would it even pollinate?
[06:50.080 --> 06:52.520]  Yes, it's the same plant.
[06:52.520 --> 06:56.320]  Technically in Colorado, the only difference between cannabis and hemp is a fucking lab
[06:56.320 --> 06:57.320]  test.
[06:57.320 --> 07:00.000]  If you got more than 0.03% THC, you're cannabis.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  If you got less than that, it's hemp.
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.960]  It is the same plant.
[07:03.960 --> 07:10.280]  That is how we make strains of different cannabinoid ratios is by breeding high THC to high CBD
[07:10.280 --> 07:11.720]  or other varieties.
[07:11.720 --> 07:12.720]  We just breed those together.
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.920]  Then you come out with different ratios, different numbers of THC and CBD.
[07:16.920 --> 07:19.640]  That is how it's done, how the breeding has happened.
[07:19.640 --> 07:24.400]  But what are the chances of industrial hemp potentially, potentially, potentially, that's
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.400]  my new word.
[07:25.400 --> 07:30.720]  What are the chances of industrial hemp potentially pollinationally, let's see it right now, potentially
[07:31.280 --> 07:33.320]  pollinating an outdoor cannabis grow?
[07:33.320 --> 07:34.320]  Would it even cross pollinate?
[07:34.320 --> 07:35.520]  Yes, it absolutely would.
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.840]  It is the same plant.
[07:36.840 --> 07:37.840]  It is very possible.
[07:37.840 --> 07:38.840]  It's very likely.
[07:38.840 --> 07:41.560]  Unfortunately, it's kind of common.
[07:41.560 --> 07:46.000]  Back in the day, we had agricultural rules that you couldn't set up a farm of a certain
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.360]  type within a certain amount of kilometers of another farm of that same type.
[07:50.360 --> 07:54.880]  When the cannabis industry came in, we started building hemp farms and cannabis farms.
[07:54.880 --> 07:59.400]  Somebody forgot about that guideline and that rule and we've begun building cannabis farms
[07:59.440 --> 08:04.880]  and grows and hemp grows and hemp farms right on top of each other and it is happening.
[08:04.880 --> 08:09.520]  I know of several people who have lost cannabis crops and who have had hemp crops contaminated
[08:09.520 --> 08:11.440]  due to stray pollen.
[08:11.440 --> 08:15.440]  Something that did happen last year that messed up an entire outdoor hemp crop is somebody's
[08:15.440 --> 08:19.400]  outdoor hemp crop was pollinated early by a cannabis crop.
[08:19.400 --> 08:22.720]  Their intention was to make outdoor feminized hemp seed.
[08:22.720 --> 08:25.640]  That shit got destroyed by somebody else's crop before that.
[08:25.680 --> 08:30.040]  We're in litigation now finding out if there's something, if that farmer who pollinated on
[08:30.040 --> 08:33.160]  accident owes the farmer who got pollinated something.
[08:33.160 --> 08:34.240]  That shit does happen.
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.240]  It's very common.
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.400]  It's very likely.
[08:36.400 --> 08:39.080]  There are things that people do to try to prevent that.
[08:39.080 --> 08:42.600]  There are different kinds of trees and plants we can set up as a barrier that will stop
[08:42.600 --> 08:43.600]  the pollen.
[08:43.600 --> 08:44.600]  It does happen.
[08:44.600 --> 08:45.720]  It happens often.
[08:45.720 --> 08:47.280]  It's very possible.
[08:47.280 --> 08:51.120]  Like I said before, that's how we get different types of either hemp or different types of
[08:51.120 --> 08:52.120]  cannabis.
[08:52.120 --> 08:53.120]  Cross pollinate that hemp.
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.000]  Let's say you got some CBD that's got like 20 or some hemp with like 20% CBD and cannabis
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.320]  with 20% THC.
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.920]  When those cross, you're going to get wildly, wildly varying different cannabinoid ratios.
[09:03.920 --> 09:05.720]  So that's what we do to cross things.
[09:05.720 --> 09:07.480]  It is absolutely possible.
[09:07.480 --> 09:10.200]  Same plant to cross pollinate that stuff.
[09:10.200 --> 09:11.200]  So it will happen.
[09:11.200 --> 09:15.040]  It will continue to happen until people learn the distancing rules.
[09:15.040 --> 09:18.060]  This is why I stress so much at outdoor season.
[09:18.060 --> 09:22.180]  This is why I tell people how important it is to find those male plants and get them
[09:22.180 --> 09:23.180]  out of your garden.
[09:23.180 --> 09:25.840]  Yeah, it's cool that you're getting the seeds out of your garden.
[09:25.840 --> 09:29.660]  You're not going to pollinate your garden, but what about everybody in your neighborhood
[09:29.660 --> 09:32.140]  that is growing cannabis outdoors?
[09:32.140 --> 09:35.060]  Everybody for miles has potential to be pollinated.
[09:35.060 --> 09:38.920]  That pollen can go, I'm going to guess two or three miles without being disrupted.
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.140]  If you get that wind blowing that pollen just right, it can go two or three miles or you
[09:43.140 --> 09:46.620]  got some birds or some bees just like the pollinators are supposed to do.
[09:46.620 --> 09:48.340]  They move pollen around quite far.
[09:48.340 --> 09:52.180]  So they land on your cannabis plants, they get pollen in their feathers or in their bug
[09:52.180 --> 09:53.180]  fuzz.
[09:53.180 --> 09:54.180]  I don't know what that shit's called on a bug.
[09:54.180 --> 09:56.380]  They get on their little bug legs.
[09:56.380 --> 09:57.660]  The bug flies around.
[09:57.660 --> 09:59.140]  It goes to another cannabis plant.
[09:59.140 --> 10:02.100]  It just took that pollen to your, from another crop over to your crop.
[10:02.100 --> 10:03.760]  It pollinated your shit.
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.620]  That's why it's really, really important that we pay attention to getting male plants out
[10:07.620 --> 10:11.180]  of the outdoor garden as soon as possible.
[10:11.180 --> 10:13.820]  You're not only going to potentially, potentially there.
[10:13.820 --> 10:18.720]  That word is again, you're not only potentially going to fuck up your grow, but you could
[10:18.720 --> 10:21.940]  mess up every grow for miles.
[10:21.940 --> 10:25.740]  The custom of dealing with that in some states that have been growing outdoor for quite a
[10:25.740 --> 10:26.740]  while.
[10:26.740 --> 10:31.060]  If you pollinate my crop, I come get your crop and then I may come get your crop next
[10:31.060 --> 10:34.060]  year and can't do shit about it because you don't fucked up my crop.
[10:34.060 --> 10:36.340]  And that's how things work on the Hill.
[10:36.340 --> 10:38.340]  That's just how it goes.
[10:38.340 --> 10:40.220]  That's grower justice out on the Hill there.
[10:40.220 --> 10:41.220]  Hill justice.
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.840]  Fuck up my crop.
[10:42.840 --> 10:43.840]  We're taking yours.
[10:43.840 --> 10:45.280]  I got bills to pay.
[10:45.280 --> 10:46.440]  You're not taking that my crop.
[10:46.440 --> 10:47.440]  All right.
[10:47.440 --> 10:48.440]  That's just how it goes.
[10:48.440 --> 10:49.440]  I'm going to move forward from that.
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.120]  That one came from, Oh, you don't want your name said you are a, you know who you are.
[10:53.120 --> 10:54.120]  Big shout out.
[10:54.120 --> 10:55.120]  Thank you for all of the support.
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.420]  I just wrote down your name to give you a shout out in a future episode.
[10:58.420 --> 11:00.040]  So thank you for the support, bro.
[11:00.040 --> 11:02.160]  You're around a lot and I do appreciate you.
[11:02.160 --> 11:03.160]  All right.
[11:03.160 --> 11:04.160]  I'm high and fucking rambly.
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.620]  So we're going to keep on moving.
[11:07.620 --> 11:08.880]  Where does the next question go?
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.160]  This next question also came from the email inbox from a long time listener.
[11:13.160 --> 11:17.420]  They do not want their name said they would rather be called used to be cool.
[11:17.420 --> 11:18.420]  You've been around for a while.
[11:18.420 --> 11:21.000]  My friend, you've been cool the whole time.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  Your name.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  I'm just going to call you cool as fuck.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  My friend is cool as fuck.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  Cool as fuck.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  Kay.
[11:26.000 --> 11:27.000]  Here is the message from cool as fuck.
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  Kay.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.400]  It says, if you read this on your show, do not use my real name.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.400]  Trust me, bro.
[11:31.400 --> 11:33.720]  I will not reveal your identity.
[11:33.720 --> 11:34.760]  It goes a lot like this.
[11:34.760 --> 11:36.100]  It says Rasta Jeff.
[11:36.100 --> 11:37.100]  That is me.
[11:37.260 --> 11:42.100]  It says, as you are one of the top cannabis breeders in the world, I don't know about
[11:42.100 --> 11:43.100]  that.
[11:43.100 --> 11:44.220]  I will accept that title if you want to give it to me.
[11:44.220 --> 11:45.660]  Never tried to get that title.
[11:45.660 --> 11:48.080]  Didn't know that was a thing.
[11:48.080 --> 11:49.420]  Let's hear some feedback on that.
[11:49.420 --> 11:53.180]  Anyway, I thought you would be the person to ask about this issue.
[11:53.180 --> 11:57.540]  Some time ago, I had wanted to obtain bog seeds, blue cush.
[11:57.540 --> 11:59.840]  That's bushy old growers, blue cush.
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.300]  But they were sold out as that strain quite often is sold out because that was a bad ass
[12:04.300 --> 12:05.300]  strain.
[12:05.300 --> 12:07.300]  So I periodically checked for a restock.
[12:07.300 --> 12:11.940]  But then, as you know, bushy old grower from bog seeds passed away suddenly, making the
[12:11.940 --> 12:14.580]  possibility of getting bog seeds very slim.
[12:14.580 --> 12:15.580]  Yes.
[12:15.580 --> 12:19.880]  Once bog died, the prices of all of his seeds increased astronomically.
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.020]  Hopefully some of those proceeds are going to Mrs. Bog because she is still around and
[12:23.020 --> 12:27.380]  we do need to support and take care of a lovely lady who does not have her husband around,
[12:27.380 --> 12:29.500]  the head of household, the fucking breadwinner.
[12:29.500 --> 12:32.700]  So hopefully some of those markups and auctions are going to Mrs. Bog.
[12:32.700 --> 12:34.940]  But yes, those seeds are now hard to find.
[12:35.100 --> 12:40.300]  It says, I decided to make one last check a few weeks ago and seedsherenow.com had a
[12:40.300 --> 12:42.100]  few packs in stock.
[12:42.100 --> 12:43.100]  So I got a pack.
[12:43.100 --> 12:45.660]  Yes, our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[12:45.660 --> 12:49.500]  I'm going to interrupt myself and do a quick apology disclaimer for seedsherenow.com.
[12:49.500 --> 12:52.780]  They did a spring cleaning of their website.
[12:52.780 --> 12:55.660]  When they did the spring cleaning, they discovered a couple of tech issues.
[12:55.660 --> 12:59.100]  It's none of my business to air their business, but they had some tech issues.
[12:59.100 --> 13:00.340]  They were rebuilding the website.
[13:00.340 --> 13:03.380]  It took them longer than expected and anticipated.
[13:03.380 --> 13:04.500]  They're getting their shit together.
[13:04.620 --> 13:07.300]  By the time this episode comes out, they should have their shit together.
[13:07.300 --> 13:08.780]  I want to apologize for them.
[13:08.780 --> 13:13.540]  What they were doing was updating their system to give you as a customer the most streamlined
[13:13.540 --> 13:15.600]  experience you could possibly have.
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.780]  So for a couple of days they were down, but it was to improve service for you as the customer.
[13:20.780 --> 13:22.500]  That's what the idea was.
[13:22.500 --> 13:27.460]  While they were doing that, they did an inventory and they discovered a lot of packs that were
[13:27.460 --> 13:29.900]  in inventory that were not on the website.
[13:29.900 --> 13:32.700]  Some things were on a vault, some things were on a stash.
[13:32.700 --> 13:33.920]  Some things got discovered.
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.880]  Those have been put on the inventory at Seeds Here Now.
[13:36.880 --> 13:40.120]  So if there's some shit you've been looking for that you thought you might have missed,
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.040]  like our friend Used to Be Cool here found some bog seeds.
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.840]  There was some thug pug stuff that went up.
[13:44.840 --> 13:45.840]  There's a lot of great shit.
[13:45.840 --> 13:49.780]  So if you've been trying to look at seedsherenow.com and you've been getting an error message or
[13:49.780 --> 13:52.620]  something was wrong with the website, be patient.
[13:52.620 --> 13:53.620]  Check again now.
[13:53.620 --> 13:55.120]  If it's not back now, keep being patient.
[13:55.120 --> 14:00.000]  I promise you, you can trust me, it will be worth your time just coming back, checking
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  it out.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Give us another shot.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  Give them another shot.
[14:03.080 --> 14:08.600]  All they did was to improve the service for you on your shopping end, on your receiving
[14:08.600 --> 14:10.920]  end, make it better for you as the consumer.
[14:10.920 --> 14:13.600]  All right, that's the disclaimer for Seeds Here Now.
[14:13.600 --> 14:14.920]  I covered two things.
[14:14.920 --> 14:15.920]  Check them out again.
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.040]  They did some website updates, also restocks on a lot of old gear that was sold out.
[14:20.040 --> 14:22.240]  Now I'm going to get myself back here into this message.
[14:22.240 --> 14:28.520]  It says, it made me think about making blue cush seeds to preserve it for my future use.
[14:28.520 --> 14:31.920]  Isn't that amazing when you've got some seeds and you love them so much that you're like,
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.040]  I've got to preserve this.
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.080]  How do I do this again?
[14:34.080 --> 14:35.760]  How do I make more?
[14:35.760 --> 14:37.600]  That's what turns growers into breeders.
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.840]  That's where it all starts.
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.440]  So it says, however, I realized I'm ignorant about making seeds.
[14:43.440 --> 14:47.640]  He goes on to say, I don't mean that I don't know that a male plant pollinates a female
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.160]  plant, but since I've got limited space, I'm going to need to return my pollinated female
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.640]  to my flower tent.
[14:54.640 --> 14:57.880]  So our friend has a basic understanding of breeding.
[14:57.880 --> 15:00.240]  He knows that a male and a female make seeds.
[15:00.240 --> 15:01.360]  He's got the basic idea.
[15:01.480 --> 15:03.480]  He knows he's going to make F2 seeds.
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.840]  The dilemma that our friend used to be cool is running into here is once they pollinate
[15:07.840 --> 15:13.180]  this plant, it will need to be returned to the flowering room so that it can continue
[15:13.180 --> 15:14.180]  to flower.
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.180]  There's only one flower room.
[15:15.180 --> 15:20.520]  He doesn't want to want to pollinate the entire grow because he does need some usable medicine.
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.360]  So there are a couple of things about this, but I'm going to continue with the message.
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.760]  My questions are, how long does it take for pollen to impregnate a female?
[15:28.760 --> 15:32.600]  And if the pollen is immediately accepted by the female, can I then spray that said
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.000]  female with water to kill any remaining pollen and safely place her back into the, under
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.640]  the flowering tent?
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.360]  Also, if you think I would benefit from any other information to help advance my plan,
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.440]  I would appreciate the input.
[15:46.440 --> 15:48.720]  We're going to give you some guidance and information here in just a moment.
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.400]  It says, I know you've been very busy and swamped with questions.
[15:52.400 --> 15:53.840]  Of course, I love getting back to you, bro.
[15:53.840 --> 15:55.400]  Never feel stressed about that.
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.240]  I've had these seeds for several months, but because of unforeseen circumstances, my schedule
[15:59.240 --> 16:00.240]  was delayed.
[16:00.240 --> 16:01.240]  Everybody's behind schedule.
[16:01.240 --> 16:02.800]  My grow is off schedule.
[16:02.800 --> 16:03.800]  Don't worry about that.
[16:03.800 --> 16:06.240]  Then it says, thank you for all you do for the community, bro.
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.240]  You are very welcome.
[16:07.240 --> 16:09.760]  Thank you for the continued feedback and support.
[16:09.760 --> 16:12.200]  Then they wrap it up with used to be cool.
[16:12.200 --> 16:14.520]  Let's talk about your breeding questions.
[16:14.520 --> 16:18.360]  You've got, you've obviously got a male plant somewhere that's producing pollen.
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.480]  I want to know where that male plant is because if it's not in your main flowering space,
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.960]  you've got it somewhere in a 12-12 cycle producing pollen.
[16:26.960 --> 16:32.720]  What I would do in an ideal world is I would put that female plant, I would get it into
[16:32.720 --> 16:33.720]  flower.
[16:33.720 --> 16:35.160]  I would move it in there with that male plant.
[16:35.160 --> 16:36.880]  I would leave it in there for just a day.
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.080]  You know, just put it in there, knock it, let that male plant dust it real good.
[16:41.080 --> 16:43.480]  Let that pollen be accepted.
[16:43.480 --> 16:49.520]  Then I would just leave it in that room or I would put it in a veg room.
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.600]  Ideally, you would pollinate this plant and give it two to three days, maybe five to seven
[16:54.600 --> 16:58.480]  days at the most just to make sure that it's impregnated well.
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.120]  Then I would move that plant back into a veg room.
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.960]  That plant's already got pollen.
[17:03.960 --> 17:07.640]  All of the bud sites that are going to receive pollen have been pollinated.
[17:07.640 --> 17:08.760]  The magic has been done.
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.000]  We're no longer looking to make flowers or buds.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.320]  Now we're focused on making seeds.
[17:13.320 --> 17:19.160]  If you move that plant back into a veg room under 18-6, it will continue to produce those
[17:19.320 --> 17:20.320]  seeds.
[17:20.320 --> 17:21.320]  It's been impregnated.
[17:21.320 --> 17:22.680]  Its whole goal now is to finish those seeds.
[17:22.680 --> 17:24.600]  Those seeds will keep going.
[17:24.600 --> 17:30.880]  If you have a veg room, you can move that plant into the veg area or leave it in that
[17:30.880 --> 17:35.720]  room where you just pollinated where that male plant is and put that light on the veg
[17:35.720 --> 17:36.720]  cycle.
[17:36.720 --> 17:38.680]  I don't know if you've got that extra room.
[17:38.680 --> 17:39.680]  That's just my main idea.
[17:39.680 --> 17:42.560]  I would put it back into the vegetative room.
[17:42.560 --> 17:45.240]  The plants in the veg room can't get pollinated.
[17:45.240 --> 17:51.360]  The seeds will mature more quickly in a vegetative room because they're getting more photons,
[17:51.360 --> 17:52.360]  more light energy.
[17:52.360 --> 17:54.840]  Again, we're not focused on flowers.
[17:54.840 --> 17:58.800]  The plant that you have pollinated will continue to produce those seeds.
[17:58.800 --> 18:01.320]  At the same time, it will reveg.
[18:01.320 --> 18:06.540]  You're going to have that plant will be seeded, filled with viable seeds, and it will begin
[18:06.540 --> 18:11.320]  to make clones that you can cut off of there to make another mother plant to again preserve
[18:11.320 --> 18:14.240]  that original mother.
[18:14.240 --> 18:18.160]  If you have the room, I would put it into a vegetative space.
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.120]  Let me read because there was something that got my attention here.
[18:22.120 --> 18:25.360]  I thought of an idea that I wanted to read to tell you.
[18:25.360 --> 18:27.440]  Yeah, I think you've got the right idea.
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.160]  I can't think of what the part that left my head was, but I would just put it back into
[18:30.160 --> 18:34.920]  the vegetative space or pollinate it.
[18:34.920 --> 18:37.000]  Leave it in that flower room for a couple of days.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.880]  You can leave it in there in the dark if you need to after it receives the pollen.
[18:40.880 --> 18:44.280]  It can sit in that dark space for 24, 48 hours in the dark.
[18:44.280 --> 18:45.280]  It won't make a difference.
[18:45.280 --> 18:47.120]  It won't get too angry.
[18:47.120 --> 18:49.240]  Then take that plant out of there.
[18:49.240 --> 18:53.080]  Spray that plant down with water because the pollen at this point has been received.
[18:53.080 --> 18:55.120]  Spray yourself down with water.
[18:55.120 --> 18:57.240]  Spray the other girls down with water.
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.480]  Then you can put it back in that room, but I'm not going to guarantee that you have killed
[19:01.480 --> 19:02.960]  all of the pollen.
[19:02.960 --> 19:07.080]  There still could be viable pollen on that plant that could get into that room.
[19:07.080 --> 19:08.920]  You may make minimal seeds.
[19:08.960 --> 19:11.280]  If you do, what's wrong with that?
[19:11.280 --> 19:13.200]  Is this your personal crop?
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.560]  Maybe you got four other strains in there.
[19:16.560 --> 19:20.920]  Maybe the bog strain, the blue cush, is loaded with seeds.
[19:20.920 --> 19:25.440]  Maybe the red cush, the purple cush, and I'm going to just guess Raphael in there maybe.
[19:25.440 --> 19:28.040]  Maybe those all get dusted with a couple of flecks of pollen.
[19:28.040 --> 19:34.140]  Now maybe you've got four or five seeds of all of those also crossed to the blue cush.
[19:34.140 --> 19:35.720]  Maybe that's what you did on accident.
[19:35.720 --> 19:37.160]  Maybe that's not a bad idea.
[19:37.160 --> 19:38.320]  Maybe that's not a bad deal.
[19:38.320 --> 19:43.040]  Maybe you do want all those seedless, but that's going to be the worst case scenario.
[19:43.040 --> 19:47.080]  The thing that left my brain, it just came back as I paused, so I'm going to talk about
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.080]  that.
[19:48.080 --> 19:52.440]  Another thing you could really do that I as a breeder who I run seeded crops most of the
[19:52.440 --> 19:57.220]  time in my grow spaces, but I also like to do a non-seeded crop so we got a test run
[19:57.220 --> 19:58.220]  of new stuff.
[19:58.220 --> 20:00.880]  That way Mike and I have something to fucking smoke on that's not seeded up.
[20:00.880 --> 20:02.160]  We could try new stuff.
[20:02.160 --> 20:03.360]  I can write strain reports.
[20:03.360 --> 20:07.440]  I can select phenotypes and keepers and move forward with projects.
[20:07.960 --> 20:14.120]  I stagger my grows to where these are so far into flower that they can't receive pollen
[20:14.120 --> 20:18.240]  and these are so early into flower that they can't receive pollen, but my target plant
[20:18.240 --> 20:20.000]  is right at the right time.
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  I've got one crop that's going to get seeded and one crop that's almost done and then another
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.400]  crop that's about to go in flower.
[20:25.400 --> 20:27.840]  It's just all about timing at that point.
[20:27.840 --> 20:31.520]  Stagger them to where one is too far ahead, one is too early.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.760]  That may help you out.
[20:32.760 --> 20:34.880]  I know you've probably got one room.
[20:34.880 --> 20:36.480]  You probably got a flowering room.
[20:36.520 --> 20:41.720]  You probably got a veggie room, but I'm confused on what you've got because you've got another
[20:41.720 --> 20:44.440]  space with a male plant that's in flower.
[20:44.440 --> 20:47.720]  You've got to have another space with that boy that's in flower because if the boy is
[20:47.720 --> 20:50.560]  in with the girls, all your girls are going to get seeded.
[20:50.560 --> 20:53.360]  I'm assuming there's a boy space somewhere.
[20:53.360 --> 20:55.120]  Get that boy going.
[20:55.120 --> 20:57.560]  You can put the girl right in there with that boy the whole time.
[20:57.560 --> 21:01.000]  You can let them share space or you can put that girl in there when the pollination time
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.400]  is perfect, but just sacrifice that space.
[21:04.400 --> 21:07.360]  Once you've cut down the male, cleaned him up, you can leave that girl in there for a
[21:07.360 --> 21:10.240]  little while until you feel like that pollen has been absorbed.
[21:10.240 --> 21:14.960]  I'd say just a few days, two to three days at the most, five to seven days.
[21:14.960 --> 21:20.480]  It's pregnant a few seconds after you pollinate it, but leave it in that other space and then
[21:20.480 --> 21:25.160]  move it to the veg room under 18-6 or then move it back to the other flower room, but
[21:25.160 --> 21:26.160]  treat it with water.
[21:26.160 --> 21:28.040]  Maybe treat it with water a couple of times.
[21:28.040 --> 21:29.440]  Let it receive the pollen.
[21:29.440 --> 21:31.080]  Let it sleep for a couple of days.
[21:31.080 --> 21:32.600]  Hit it with water.
[21:32.600 --> 21:33.600]  Let the lights fucking cycle.
[21:33.800 --> 21:34.800]  Hit it with water again.
[21:34.800 --> 21:35.960]  Move it back into the other room.
[21:35.960 --> 21:38.000]  Hit those bitches in that room with water.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.480]  Spray yourself down also because that pollen is going to get everywhere.
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.280]  I feel like I've given you the right idea.
[21:43.280 --> 21:48.320]  Either put the plant in the space where the male was after you pollinate it, put the plant
[21:48.320 --> 21:53.000]  in the veg space after you pollinate it, or very carefully spray everything down and put
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.400]  it back into that flower room.
[21:54.400 --> 21:59.700]  Your other option is to stagger your crops, which I know is kind of a pain in the ass.
[21:59.700 --> 22:01.120]  We all want to make as much as we can.
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.760]  You want to fill that room like I just said, but sometimes you got to make a little space
[22:05.760 --> 22:08.120]  just for that one pollinated pregnant girl.
[22:08.120 --> 22:09.120]  The pregnant girls are always special.
[22:09.120 --> 22:13.280]  You got to treat them special, give them their own space, do special things, special arrangements
[22:13.280 --> 22:14.280]  for them.
[22:14.280 --> 22:15.680]  All right, my buddy used to be cool.
