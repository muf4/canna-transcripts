[01:05.450 --> 01:08.450]  our good friend, our repeat offender, White Mike is back. Thanks for joining me, dude.
[01:08.450 --> 01:10.090]  Yeah, man. What's up, everybody?
[01:10.090 --> 01:11.490]  Oh, Mike, how are you?
[01:11.490 --> 01:13.530]  Doing well, man. It was a good 420.
[01:13.530 --> 01:14.530]  Was it good for you?
[01:14.530 --> 01:17.650]  Yeah. I feel a little dried out still.
[01:17.650 --> 01:20.930]  Yeah. I'm a little dehydrated. I feel like I've been yelling and screaming, but it's
[01:20.930 --> 01:25.210]  just from the dabs and all the flowers that I smoke. I don't smoke a lot of flowers. I
[01:25.210 --> 01:26.210]  indulge.
[01:26.210 --> 01:28.770]  I'm feeling a little half human, half jerky right now.
[01:28.770 --> 01:33.650]  Half jerky. You've always been a little jerky, huh? I've been since the Dude Grows Cup last
[01:33.650 --> 01:39.370]  week. I've been smoking heavy. I haven't stopped since then. Luckily, we have cool employment.
[01:39.370 --> 01:44.850]  So at 420, on 420, we were able to take some 420 smokeage. I just rearranged our break
[01:44.850 --> 01:49.650]  schedule. That was pretty nice. That was the beginning of a smoke-filled weekend. I haven't
[01:49.650 --> 01:50.650]  stopped.
[01:50.650 --> 01:51.650]  Basically.
[01:51.650 --> 01:56.610]  I went to the dispensary on sometime last week, Wednesday, I think. Yeah, I went last
[01:56.610 --> 02:01.490]  Wednesday. And I bought hash. I bought concentrates for the rest of the week. Plus, I bought a
[02:01.490 --> 02:08.650]  stash for 420. I burned right... Yeah. Of course, my throat is shot. I burnt right through
[02:08.650 --> 02:12.410]  that. It's gone now. I had to go shopping again today. We just got back from the dispensary
[02:12.410 --> 02:16.570]  just a little bit ago. So that's a great segue. I like to start the podcast off by letting
[02:16.570 --> 02:20.110]  you guys know what I'm smoking. Today, that's going to be a challenge because I just got
[02:20.110 --> 02:25.250]  back from the dispensary and I think we've taken a dab of almost everything we bought.
[02:25.250 --> 02:30.530]  I've got some Mendo Breath Ambrosia, which tastes phenomenal. It's quite tasty. It set
[02:30.530 --> 02:35.090]  me back in my seat. We haven't tried that one. I haven't tried that one. The Sour Pez
[02:35.090 --> 02:40.890]  Ambrosia, super sweet, pezzy candy, kind of a grapefruit with a cherry aftertaste. The
[02:40.890 --> 02:47.930]  Clementine. The Clementine tastes amazing. It doesn't get me high. But the Clementine.
[02:47.930 --> 02:52.370]  Clementine and Clementi are two different things. The Clementine has that Clementine
[02:52.690 --> 02:56.130]  deliciousness, but it's also got another thing in there that does get me high. So that's
[02:56.130 --> 03:00.850]  beautiful. Then the one that fucked me up, the one that made me want to just go lay down
[03:00.850 --> 03:05.890]  on the couch or maybe even on the floor might have been okay, was the Louis XIII.
[03:06.770 --> 03:07.810]  This battery.
[03:07.810 --> 03:08.530]  You'll do that.
[03:08.530 --> 03:12.130]  Dude, I took that dab and I was talking and in the middle of my sentence, I was like,
[03:12.130 --> 03:18.170]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, did I melt? Am I done? Like I felt like
[03:18.170 --> 03:22.130]  that girl on the couch in the fucking old commercial that just melted. That's what it
[03:22.170 --> 03:27.770]  did to me. I finally found that. Yes, I finally found that weed that did that. That shit got
[03:27.770 --> 03:34.730]  me lit. So yeah, the King Louis XIII batter from Apothecary Farms. That stuff was awesome.
[03:34.730 --> 03:39.850]  I liked the flavor of the Mendo breath better, but the high on the Louis was pretty phenomenal.
[03:40.490 --> 03:44.570]  Then, ladies and gentlemen, if you listen to the podcast often, you've heard me talk about
[03:44.570 --> 03:51.770]  the Starchild OG that I got from a cut above. It's back. They've got more. It's back. I went
[03:51.770 --> 03:56.650]  and got some. Dude, it is so delicious. It's almost, but yeah, but the jar that I bought
[03:56.650 --> 04:00.970]  today is almost gone now. Mike and I have been overindulging on this. It's wonderful.
[04:00.970 --> 04:08.170]  Would you agree with the citrus, dryer sheet, sandalwood, peppermint flavor?
[04:09.690 --> 04:10.250]  Yeah.
[04:10.250 --> 04:12.490]  Okay. Hint of peppermint.
[04:12.490 --> 04:16.570]  It's a lot. It's got that candle store kind of, like that's a lot of
[04:17.530 --> 04:24.250]  scents and flavors all at once, but the dryer sheet in the candy were out front.
[04:24.250 --> 04:28.650]  Yes. Yes. And that dryer sheet thing that it leaves on your mouth, that cotton mouth flavor.
[04:28.650 --> 04:34.090]  I enjoy that flavor, that dryer sheet. That's a terpenylene is what I think that terpenoid is
[04:34.090 --> 04:38.570]  that gives you that flavor. I really enjoy that. It comes in. You find that in Jack Harer a lot.
[04:38.570 --> 04:43.050]  You find that in the train wreck, I guess, because that's what this cross has train wreck in it.
[04:43.050 --> 04:47.450]  That's probably where that came from. I love it. Great flavor. We haven't tried it yet,
[04:47.450 --> 04:55.050]  but I've also got some of the Green Dot Labs black label, white Durban nectar. This is the
[04:55.050 --> 04:59.370]  white cross to Durban poison. I'm excited to try this one in a little bit here. I just,
[04:59.370 --> 05:03.290]  we've just tried so many things that I had to save one for later. That Green Dot is kind of the,
[05:03.290 --> 05:04.170]  the fancy one.
[05:04.810 --> 05:08.170]  We wanted to do a slightly more coherent show. So we slowed our roll a little.
[05:09.290 --> 05:10.410]  I just a little.
[05:10.410 --> 05:15.130]  The Green Dot is a great product. It's worth the money, but I prefer a different consistency
[05:15.130 --> 05:18.890]  and everything was on sale for $4.20. So I grabbed some of the Green Dot black label.
[05:18.890 --> 05:23.130]  And that's going to be like my, my secret stash, my spoil myself stash.
[05:23.130 --> 05:26.810]  The after podcast dabs when you want to get a little goofy and not have to pay attention to
[05:26.810 --> 05:31.210]  anything. Right. So that's what we're smoking on today. Mike really seemed to like the sour
[05:31.210 --> 05:35.690]  Pez when I gave him a dab of that. That was really nice. But then the, which one was it
[05:35.690 --> 05:39.530]  that really made you choke up a lot? Oh, the Mendo Breath was definitely. Yeah. The Mendo
[05:39.530 --> 05:43.050]  Breath was a coffer. Yeah. That one made you choke up a whole bunch, but I think everybody
[05:43.050 --> 05:47.450]  enjoyed all the dabs. So great work to a cut above and Green Dot and Apothecary.
[05:49.450 --> 05:55.130]  Yeah. It's been a great 420. It's been a hazy and daisy 420. Mike, do you do anything exciting on
[05:55.130 --> 06:01.210]  420? Nope. Just a lot of consumption. A lot of consumption. Didn't go anywhere. Skip most of
[06:01.210 --> 06:06.410]  the events. It's easier that way. Yep. It's a, everything's real crowded. I've been stocking up
[06:06.410 --> 06:11.450]  for a while. So I got home and I was like, well, I have all my favorite flower and a bunch of live
[06:11.450 --> 06:17.690]  residents. Just enjoy it. Let's just enjoy it. Speaking of things to enjoy, I don't know. I'm
[06:17.690 --> 06:21.610]  trying to find a segue. This podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[06:21.610 --> 06:24.490]  Company. That's right. If you need some new genetics for your garden, I recommend the
[06:24.490 --> 06:29.450]  Hella Dank Seed Company. You can find them at dankseed.store, the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[06:29.450 --> 06:33.850]  Grab some new ivory genetic seeds. Also shout out to my friends at PL Grow Systems. You can find
[06:33.850 --> 06:39.370]  them at plgrow.systems is what I think that is. I may have gotten that completely wrong. I apologize.
[06:39.370 --> 06:43.370]  Google PL Grow Systems. You'll find them. Check out their product called the Minder. I highly
[06:43.370 --> 06:49.210]  recommend it. Much love, much respect to PL Grow Systems. You guys, I'm able to go to events like
[06:49.210 --> 06:53.050]  the Dude Grows Cup. I'm able to go to Civic Center Park and take dabs with my friends in the wind and
[06:53.050 --> 06:57.850]  rain and try to enjoy 420. I'm able to go to reggae shows and I can check on the garden with my phone
[06:57.850 --> 07:02.330]  by using the Minder unit from PL Grow Systems. That's right. I can tell you what the temp and
[07:02.330 --> 07:06.650]  humidity is in my room at all times. I don't have to walk to it. I don't have to stress. I can be in
[07:06.650 --> 07:11.290]  my underwear on the couch watching Bob's Burgers and we can check on the grow room. It's that easy.
[07:11.290 --> 07:16.890]  PL Grow Systems. Make sure you check them out. Much love and respect. All right. Uh, the list of
[07:16.890 --> 07:24.410]  things I want to talk about. I got my weed card renewed. About time. Uh, too early. Actually,
[07:24.410 --> 07:28.570]  I was having problems. I can't. Too early is way easier to fix than too late. That's the truth.
[07:29.050 --> 07:32.890]  Causes a bunch of headaches. They won't let me pay for it because I'm not 30 days within the
[07:32.890 --> 07:36.970]  expiration date yet. So I've got to wait a couple of days here before I can pay for it, which that's
[07:36.970 --> 07:42.410]  fine with me. I'm getting, I'm buying, I'm on free time right now. But, uh, so the hardest part about
[07:42.410 --> 07:46.810]  getting my weed card renewed was getting the fucking appointment. I had to call several times
[07:46.810 --> 07:50.490]  and they kept saying we're booked. And I was like, well, what the fuck? And like, we're booked. And I
[07:50.490 --> 07:54.570]  was like, can you just give me a date further out? And they're like, no. What happened was
[07:54.570 --> 08:00.170]  the main weed doctor for my area has retired. Uh, the guy that Mike and I go to, can I say his
[08:00.170 --> 08:04.490]  name? Is that fair? Do you do that? Uh, dr. Bruce Reimers has done. He's retired from the cannabis
[08:04.490 --> 08:08.090]  industry. He's not writing marijuana cards anymore. It doesn't surprise me. He's been
[08:08.090 --> 08:14.490]  doing it for a minute for at least five or six years that I've gone to him. We, we, yeah. Yeah.
[08:14.490 --> 08:18.570]  It's at least been five or six, probably closer to eight. So he's made plenty of money. He's
[08:18.570 --> 08:23.050]  retired, but, uh, there was a new doctor there and I had to kind of reintroduce myself and meet the
[08:23.050 --> 08:27.210]  new doctor, but the hardest part. So the hardest part was getting the appointment. Then they said,
[08:27.210 --> 08:31.610]  we've got this day at this time. And I was like, what are my other options? I was like, no,
[08:31.610 --> 08:36.170]  you're coming fucking Wednesday at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in Colorado Springs. We will see you
[08:36.170 --> 08:41.770]  there or no doctor for you. And I was like, oh shit. Okay. So we go there and, uh, I didn't get
[08:41.770 --> 08:44.810]  stuck in the elevator this time. The last time I went to that building, the L I got stuck in the
[08:44.810 --> 08:48.250]  elevator and they almost canceled my appointment because I was 20 minutes late. I called them. I
[08:48.250 --> 08:50.890]  was like, Hey, I'm stuck in your elevator. And they're like, yeah, don't miss your appointment.
[08:50.890 --> 08:53.770]  And I was like, no, I'm still, will you help me? I'm stuck in the fucking elevator. And they're
[08:53.770 --> 08:57.290]  like, we don't know what to do. Just don't make your appointment. And I kind of threw a fit when
[08:57.290 --> 09:01.450]  I got in the office. I was like, Hey, uh, I was stuck in the elevator. Like you should feel bad
[09:01.450 --> 09:05.610]  for me. Like you shouldn't just fuck my appointment. I was here. Like I was trapped.
[09:05.610 --> 09:09.770]  Like I wasn't just drinking off in the basement. I was stuck. And so they let me have my appointment,
[09:09.770 --> 09:14.170]  but this time, uh, they're, they said it's going to be a minute because the, uh, the state is
[09:14.170 --> 09:18.490]  updating their computer system. We're no longer going to have these cards that we print. It's
[09:18.490 --> 09:22.330]  going to be attached to the barcode on your ID. So you're no longer going to have to present a
[09:22.330 --> 09:26.090]  card. You'll just walk in with your Colorado ID. They will swipe that just like they do with the
[09:26.090 --> 09:30.730]  bar. It'll show that you're old enough that you're a patient and it'll let you in. So the day that I
[09:30.730 --> 09:34.970]  went was the first day they were activating this new system, which meant the computer was all
[09:34.970 --> 09:41.050]  fucked up and everything was taken forever. So my visit, I sat in line for at least an hour,
[09:41.050 --> 09:45.130]  maybe two, uh, just playing with my phone, chilling. Uh, they have you fill out the
[09:45.130 --> 09:48.970]  little application and stuff online. Uh, I just hit refresh because mine, I'd already been all
[09:48.970 --> 09:54.330]  filled out before all my information is still the same, uh, refilled everything out. Then the doctor
[09:54.330 --> 09:57.690]  came and explained what happened to Bruce. He's like, yeah, he's been in the weed industry since
[09:57.690 --> 10:00.890]  the seventies. He was like a big part of legalization where he's from. And he did all
[10:00.890 --> 10:05.530]  this and he's like, but he retired. So I'm the new doctor. My name is this, uh, how many times
[10:05.530 --> 10:10.250]  have you seen Dr. Reimers? And I said, this is probably my seventh or eighth time with medical
[10:10.250 --> 10:14.970]  alternatives, renewing my card. And he goes, oh, okay. Just signed for my paper. He's like,
[10:14.970 --> 10:18.250]  there you go. Here's your new renewal. And that was pretty much all it took. And he said, this
[10:18.250 --> 10:22.170]  is going to take 24 hours to update because the website is down, but check this in 24 hours,
[10:22.170 --> 10:26.810]  make sure all your information is cool. And then you'll be legit. And so, uh, fucking went about
[10:26.810 --> 10:30.170]  my day. I went shopping at dispensaries in Colorado Springs since I was up there anyway.
[10:30.170 --> 10:34.330]  Uh, high five, everybody leave and go shopping. Uh, 24 hours later, I go to check everything.
[10:34.330 --> 10:38.010]  Everything was legit. All my new stuff was updated. Everything was cool. And it allowed
[10:38.010 --> 10:42.090]  me to print off a new card, but it won't let me pay for anything yet. I've got to wait, I think
[10:42.090 --> 10:47.450]  six more days until my old card is 30 days. Yeah. I know it's going to be within 30 days. I'm not
[10:47.450 --> 10:53.050]  even 30 days from expired yet. You got to jump on it. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Well, renewing has always
[10:53.050 --> 10:57.770]  like the doctor's appointments always been the biggest hurdle and oftentimes, yeah. The doctor's
[10:57.770 --> 11:02.010]  appointment. And then back in the day, you would get your card renewal and then have to mail it in.
[11:02.010 --> 11:06.410]  And then they'd have to review it and send it back to you. And that could take six to eight weeks.
[11:06.410 --> 11:11.610]  And if there was a problem with it, now you're looking at another three to five more weeks. Yep.
[11:11.610 --> 11:16.330]  And so it was taking you 13 weeks, 14, 16 weeks just to get your card. And then you couldn't shop.
[11:16.330 --> 11:20.250]  You wouldn't be able to go to the dispensary. And I go through a little bit of concentrate to where
[11:20.250 --> 11:23.690]  if I couldn't shop at a medical dispensary, it would probably put me in a pinch. So I've got to
[11:23.690 --> 11:28.810]  stay on top of that. I've got to stay on top of that. So yeah, I got ahead of it. Uh, especially
[11:28.810 --> 11:32.890]  being in the industry. Those are something that I always stay on top of is my, my weed card and my
[11:32.890 --> 11:37.050]  badge, stuff like that. You got to stay on top of that. So I got the weed card. It was super easy.
[11:37.050 --> 11:44.730]  Um, they do not do extended plant counts like they used to do back in the day. You could say,
[11:44.730 --> 11:48.490]  I need an extended plant count. And they would say, what hurts? And you'd say, I don't know,
[11:48.490 --> 11:53.930]  what does 250 bucks worth of pain look like? What does fucking 24 plants cost? And they would say,
[11:53.930 --> 11:58.250]  oh, okay, well then there you go. Here's fucking money. Here's plant count. I'm going to write
[11:58.250 --> 12:03.610]  this down on your paperwork. We'll be okay. Mike shaking his head. That's how it used to be. Mike,
[12:03.610 --> 12:06.890]  we're, we're, we're not going to play games because it's not like that anymore. So it doesn't matter.
[12:06.890 --> 12:10.330]  There were a lot of doctors. Fuck. I was trying to remember a doctor's name the other day and I
[12:10.330 --> 12:13.610]  couldn't remember. It just popped in my head. I know his fucking name right now. Anyway. Um,
[12:14.170 --> 12:20.410]  there were a lot of doctors walking in and they had a, it was like the drink menu at Chili's.
[12:20.410 --> 12:25.290]  Yeah. They just had a little placard at the end of the deck on the doctor's desk. That was like
[12:26.010 --> 12:31.610]  regular six count 99, like 12 count. I don't remember one, one 50,
[12:32.170 --> 12:38.250]  yep. 24 count. $300. Yeah. It went up to 500 count. And I was just like, that is the shadiest
[12:38.250 --> 12:42.250]  shit. Yep. You just pay more money and you can get more. Just show me where it hurts. Remember
[12:42.250 --> 12:45.850]  fill out the little pain graph and we'll give you more plants. Some doctors didn't give a shit.
[12:45.850 --> 12:50.410]  Some doctors were pretty tight on it. Some doctors would not give you more. Some doctors would
[12:50.410 --> 12:54.650]  blatantly advertise. We love to give extended plant counts. They would talk about it. That's
[12:55.210 --> 13:01.370]  been putting the screws to that whole system for four years now. There are lots of new paperwork.
[13:01.370 --> 13:04.810]  I'm not sure because it was the first day of a new system. So I said lots of new paperwork.
[13:04.810 --> 13:10.490]  Well, also they've raised the part of this that I figured we would have brought up by now, but
[13:10.490 --> 13:16.730]  haven't touched on specifically is it's attached to your driver's license now. So when you're asked
[13:16.730 --> 13:21.690]  license registration and insurance, that information's coming up on the screen,
[13:22.490 --> 13:27.050]  possibly you're a medical patient. Possibly. Is that a HIPAA violation to put that up on the screen?
[13:28.250 --> 13:32.090]  There's gotta be, I don't, I'm not worried about it myself, but that's got to concern somebody.
[13:32.090 --> 13:38.650]  Could be considered one. The thing I don't like about it is now that just drastically increases
[13:39.370 --> 13:44.730]  the likelihood of the cop comes up, doesn't suspect a thing. The, the, the word marijuana
[13:44.730 --> 13:48.410]  never leaves the cop's mouth. Doesn't smell it. Doesn't see it. Doesn't think about it.
[13:48.970 --> 13:54.170]  Goes back to the cruiser, runs your shit, come back up. And now that's all the conversation's
[13:54.170 --> 13:59.210]  about. Cause that's what came up on your ID. Right. And maybe they can turn this from a
[13:59.770 --> 14:09.050]  didn't signal that lane change or, you know, speeding to a DWAI or DUI. And that's more money
[14:09.050 --> 14:12.890]  for their jurisdiction. Change the whole story just because it flagged that you're a weed patient.
[14:12.890 --> 14:19.050]  Yep. That doesn't make sense. Stop in a, in just a brief thing. I'd like to have faith that HIPAA
[14:19.050 --> 14:24.890]  protects me from that, but, but like I said, all right, so there's a lot of new paperwork,
[14:24.890 --> 14:28.250]  lots of new questions. You have to fill out a whole bunch of stuff. It's like going to a real
[14:28.250 --> 14:32.410]  doctor for the first time. Even though I'd been to that doctor several times or that office,
[14:32.410 --> 14:37.130]  at least it was like going to a whole brand new doctor. You have to put in, they ask about your
[14:37.130 --> 14:41.690]  diet. They asked about my exercise. They asked about a whole bunch of stuff. So it felt a little
[14:41.690 --> 14:47.050]  more legit than it did in the past. There was a lot of weird questions that I was like, what? Like
[14:47.050 --> 14:52.570]  I just started making check marks, whatever. Lots of questions. I was going to say extended
[14:52.570 --> 14:58.730]  plant counts are not going to happen anymore. You have to bring in actual paperwork with your
[14:58.730 --> 15:03.530]  qualifying condition. It has to be current. There were people in there with stacks of paperwork and
[15:03.530 --> 15:07.050]  this doctor would not give them extended plant counts. He's like, no, I'm afraid of those. This
[15:07.050 --> 15:10.650]  doesn't qualify. I think you should be able to cover your needs with the plants you can grow.
[15:10.650 --> 15:20.170]  Basically, there's no point in an extended plant count anymore. The state of Colorado capped a
[15:20.170 --> 15:28.650]  household plant count at 12. The entire state? Yeah, statewide. There's a couple of specific
[15:29.210 --> 15:36.570]  property zone designations for homesteaders, like dig your own well, generate your own power,
[15:36.570 --> 15:43.050]  raise your own chickens type properties. You can have more than 12, but the days of
[15:43.930 --> 15:49.210]  renting a house and throwing two hoop houses in the backyard and going hog wild with 499
[15:49.210 --> 15:57.930]  have been over for a minute. Everybody that was doing that saw it coming. So the last year
[15:58.650 --> 16:02.170]  it was allowed, they went hog wild, super hog wild.
[16:05.210 --> 16:14.410]  Lots of negative press and industry wide black eyes were generated and the heat to extinguish
[16:14.410 --> 16:22.970]  medical from Colorado just quadrupled. So doctors are under strict supervision. Cardholders are under
[16:22.970 --> 16:28.570]  substantial more scrutiny. If medical is here in five years, I'll be shocked.
[16:28.570 --> 16:32.810]  They did not want to even talk about and hear about extended plant counts. When you bring it up,
[16:32.810 --> 16:34.650]  I didn't even say it, I didn't care. I was like, whatever.
[16:34.650 --> 16:40.090]  If you're going for an extended plant count right now, show up with terminal illness
[16:41.530 --> 16:47.530]  documentation and documentation that you live in BFE. Otherwise it ain't happening.
[16:47.530 --> 16:50.970]  And otherwise it's probably useless because you're capped anyway.
[16:51.610 --> 16:57.930]  Right now the sheriff in the county North of us is going hog wild, busting every grow he can.
[16:58.810 --> 17:05.530]  And some of them, they're like 2000 plants, 4,000 plants. And some of them, it's like 106 plants.
[17:05.530 --> 17:11.450]  And the news reports, those are the same. And it's like, dude, that's dude had got caught with
[17:11.450 --> 17:16.010]  his cloner full, like calm the fuck down. Oh, because every clone in that hundred site
[17:16.010 --> 17:20.970]  cloner counts as a plant. God damn. That's a major grow. That was millions of dollars in
[17:20.970 --> 17:24.410]  flowers that were growing in there. Yeah. And most of the time they just,
[17:25.130 --> 17:30.170]  like, if you've got a cutting and a cloner, they, they assign that as a street value of $2,500.
[17:33.690 --> 17:38.490]  It's just, if anyone's got 2,500 bucks for a cutting, I'm in come get some cuttings. All right.
[17:39.690 --> 17:44.090]  So yeah, no extended plant counts. Doctor visit was super easy. Everything was pretty chill.
[17:44.170 --> 17:48.250]  Everything, all the payments happen online. They take cash at the doctor's office. It's very
[17:48.250 --> 17:52.410]  affordable, very affordable. You get a pretty generous discount for being in the cannabis
[17:52.410 --> 17:56.730]  industry. So if you have a Colorado marijuana enforcement division badge, wear that to your
[17:56.730 --> 18:00.010]  appointment. When you go see the doctor, show it to the lady. When you check out, say, Hey,
[18:00.010 --> 18:04.010]  do I get a discount for this? They should give you a deal. That should help you out at least a
[18:04.010 --> 18:09.370]  little bit. It did me. Plus I've been going there for, like I said, that's probably my eighth ish
[18:09.450 --> 18:14.410]  time. Getting a card from that guy. I've gone to that doctor in like four different office spaces.
[18:14.410 --> 18:19.050]  Yeah. They move around. They move around so frequently, but yeah. So they gave me a pretty
[18:19.050 --> 18:24.810]  fair discount. It was very affordable. Uh, overall it was a super easy, fairly friendly visit. Not,
[18:24.810 --> 18:29.450]  not, no, not a lot of fucking drama or bad time challenges. Yeah. Well, back in the day,
[18:29.450 --> 18:32.570]  it used to be different because you have to fill out everything by hand. They would give you a blue
[18:32.570 --> 18:36.890]  pan and if you fucked up for four hours, yeah, yeah. Everything would have to, yeah. For four
[18:36.890 --> 18:40.330]  hours just to see the doc, everything would have to be in a blue pan. And if you fucked up,
[18:40.330 --> 18:44.250]  they'd have to give you a new paper because you couldn't make any corrections on it.
[18:44.250 --> 18:48.890]  So you just be writing super carefully. And then all the, there would be so many ridiculous
[18:48.890 --> 18:52.090]  questions and there's always people that fuck it up. So all the people that work there were tied
[18:52.090 --> 18:56.090]  up, fixing everybody's errors all the time. It used to take forever. Uh, now it's all on a computer.
[18:56.090 --> 19:01.290]  So you just go make a bunch of clicks. It's pretty easy. Pretty easy. All right. Uh, one thing I want
[19:01.290 --> 19:06.490]  to touch on it's still happening. So I'm not positive. Uh, I'm not sure of the final outcome.
[19:06.490 --> 19:10.970]  I don't have any awards. I don't know if anything has happened, but at the time we're recording this,
[19:11.610 --> 19:19.610]  the 420 High Times Cannabis Cup celebration in San Bernardino is happening. Yeah, it is going on.
[19:19.610 --> 19:25.210]  The reason that's a big deal is because Thursday there was an announcement made, an announcement
[19:25.210 --> 19:32.730]  made that High Times was denied permits for their event in San Bernardino. The event was denied
[19:32.730 --> 19:37.290]  permits, uh, for several reasons for changes in laws. Then they were saying they were going to
[19:37.290 --> 19:41.770]  let them hold the event, but there would be no consumption because of the change in California
[19:41.770 --> 19:49.370]  legalization. Then whoever is in charge of running the dispensaries and medical marijuana centers and
[19:49.370 --> 19:55.690]  marijuana centers in California issued a statement saying that anybody attending this event would be,
[19:56.410 --> 20:03.450]  uh, under scrutiny by that division. High Times went so far as to have security guards at every
[20:03.450 --> 20:08.490]  entrance checking people and only allowing them to bring in their legal allowed amount of flour.
[20:08.490 --> 20:13.530]  So people are only bringing in an ounce of flour or eight grams of concentrates or something like
[20:13.530 --> 20:18.090]  that. Back in the day, people would bring in a backpack of flour and start hustling it. People
[20:18.090 --> 20:25.450]  would bring in concentrates and sell it. This time High Times was only allowing, uh, tax ID businesses
[20:25.450 --> 20:29.210]  to be a part of their event. So you had to have a real business license. You have to have a
[20:29.930 --> 20:34.810]  marijuana business license to set up. So you signed up with your application, you put in your,
[20:34.810 --> 20:39.530]  your info, you turned that into High Times, then you set up your booth. So the people that are in
[20:39.530 --> 20:43.530]  charge of the marijuana control, I can't remember the name of their division. I should have written
[20:43.530 --> 20:48.730]  that down. Sorry. Uh, those folks are threatening to walk through the cannabis cup. At the time I'm
[20:48.730 --> 20:54.490]  recording, it hasn't happened so far. It's gone off without a hitch. Uh, but this is what happens
[20:54.490 --> 21:00.170]  when we go from the wild, wild west. So I was saying that they're letting people in through
[21:00.170 --> 21:03.450]  these gates and they're checking everybody, but the vendors that have product that are allowed
[21:03.450 --> 21:07.210]  to come in are coming in through a back gate and able to set up. So they've got product. This is
[21:07.210 --> 21:12.170]  how they're making sure no illegal cannabis sales are happening there. Right? Yeah. Kind of weird.
[21:12.170 --> 21:17.690]  Mike's rolling his eyes. It's we're stuck in this awkward spot where we're trying to host an event.
[21:17.690 --> 21:25.690]  That's like 50% football, professional football game, 50% Burning Man. And we're trying to do it
[21:26.330 --> 21:33.770]  a hundred percent in the football arena venues. And the only way to, at this point to get the
[21:33.770 --> 21:39.050]  events that we want to attend, where there's consumption, where you can go around and sample
[21:39.050 --> 21:43.530]  different people's products, you know, enjoy yourself just like you would at the great
[21:43.530 --> 21:48.490]  American beer fest or taste of Colorado or any of those other events to actually get that event
[21:48.490 --> 21:54.170]  off. You really need to go to the middle of nowhere and allow open consumption events.
[21:54.170 --> 21:59.770]  Like my dream would be to bring one to this, a four 20 event to the state fair down here.
[21:59.770 --> 22:03.370]  It's the perfect space. There's plenty indoor. There's plenty outdoor. They could do it. So
[22:03.370 --> 22:08.170]  fucking high times was looking for a venue. I recommended the state fair and they basically
[22:08.170 --> 22:13.130]  laughed in my face, the state fair and high times. Both were like, yeah, right. Which is dumb. Both
[22:13.130 --> 22:16.730]  of them could make a fortune there. Right. And it's plenty of parking. There's plenty of indoor
[22:16.730 --> 22:21.610]  and or outdoor buildings. We got places for concerts. Yeah. Yeah. There's three different
[22:21.610 --> 22:29.690]  stages. There's endless square footage for vending booths of all kinds. Like, but it'll never happen.
[22:29.690 --> 22:35.050]  I could walk there. There's plenty of indoor outdoors. So you can have all the consumption
[22:35.050 --> 22:42.730]  you want and never have a building full of smoke. It, I mean, it's, it would be so easy to do it.
[22:42.730 --> 22:48.650]  Stupid. Yeah. But it'll never happen for lots of reasons. Like in Colorado, licensed cannabis
[22:48.650 --> 22:57.450]  businesses can't give away anything period. And so like, even if they go to an event and only hand
[22:57.450 --> 23:04.170]  out t-shirts and shit, they're still kind of pushing it. Um, they're supposed to sit there
[23:04.170 --> 23:08.970]  and charge you a penny for everything. Even for the t-shirt? Yeah. Why? Okay. Just so that they're
[23:08.970 --> 23:13.530]  not giving anything away. Cause it's product. It's all product in their computer. Some legislature at some
[23:13.530 --> 23:18.330]  point were like, but drug dealers give out free samples to hook patients. That's always been the
[23:18.330 --> 23:25.050]  catch. Yeah. It's like, no, we're just swag. Just like the record people. We want you to buy the CD.
[23:25.610 --> 23:31.690]  Here's the t-shirt. Get excited. Right. So well, Friday, when the Cannabis Cup was setting up, a
[23:31.690 --> 23:36.250]  lot of people were missing. There were a lot of empty booth spaces. I don't blame them. About a third of the
[23:36.250 --> 23:40.810]  booths showed up. The event went on Friday. People came in, the concerts that were scheduled for
[23:40.810 --> 23:44.650]  Friday night happened. The bands performed. People smoked out and had a good time and watched these
[23:44.650 --> 23:49.530]  bands. Nothing happened. Saturday, things would not went off without a hitch. We were far into Sunday.
[23:49.530 --> 23:52.490]  I haven't checked any news yet because we've been, Mike and I have been together and I've been on the
[23:52.490 --> 23:56.650]  road and doing stuff. Mike and I have been hanging out, podcasting and taking dabs. And then I was driving to the dispensary.
[23:57.450 --> 24:03.450]  It was going to go well past this weekend, I bet. Right. But so nobody has raided or shut down or walked
[24:03.450 --> 24:07.530]  through the Cannabis Cup, as far as I'm aware. And they're well into the Sunday night concert. The
[24:07.530 --> 24:12.330]  events have happened or the awards have happened by now. So Saturday, people started setting up.
[24:12.330 --> 24:16.170]  Friday, half the people or a third of the people showed up. Saturday, people actually started coming
[24:16.170 --> 24:22.170]  and setting up. Sunday, everybody was there. Swer from the Cali Connection was on Instagram Live
[24:22.170 --> 24:24.810]  talking shit. He's like, fuck you to all these people that didn't show up. You're a bunch of
[24:24.810 --> 24:28.650]  pussies. We're cannabis soldiers. Since when do we need permits to be cannabis warriors? When do we
[24:28.650 --> 24:34.490]  need a permit for this? Let's get it on. So I want to give a huge shout out, not just to Swer, but to
[24:34.490 --> 24:41.530]  everybody who still has that cannabis warrior fucking spirit. This isn't, we're getting too
[24:41.530 --> 24:47.610]  comfortable. A lot of the suits and the bureaucrats and whoever you want to call them are taking over.
[24:47.610 --> 24:52.970]  They've gotten involved. It's there. We're losing the passion. All of those people were the people
[24:52.970 --> 24:56.650]  that were scared to show up. Those were all the people that didn't do it. There's a lot more to
[24:56.650 --> 25:03.610]  risk now. Absolutely. You can't start over by getting a job at Home Depot and just sucking it
[25:03.610 --> 25:09.050]  up for six months and saving your money and going and getting two lights and a fucking fan and
[25:09.050 --> 25:16.650]  getting back to it. If you fuck up now and you crash out, you're out millions to investors.
[25:16.650 --> 25:20.970]  Absolutely. And half of every paycheck you earn from now till you die is going to go to
[25:20.970 --> 25:25.690]  paying those fuckers off. Right. But I just want to give huge respect to all the people that didn't
[25:25.690 --> 25:30.010]  puss out that showed up and said, Hey, they're trying to shut us down. Watch us, watch me do it
[25:30.010 --> 25:33.450]  because that's what I do. Cause I'm a cannabis soldier because that's where we are. That's where
[25:33.450 --> 25:36.730]  our heart is. I just have a lot of respect for those folks. I respect the other folks too,
[25:36.730 --> 25:39.530]  in the same way, but I would give a shout out to all those people. It's going to take a lot of
[25:39.530 --> 25:45.290]  soldiers doing what they do to get us to where we want to be. I think everyone in the cannabis
[25:45.290 --> 25:52.810]  community wants to at least have the option to attend a four 20 event, or it doesn't even have
[25:52.810 --> 25:58.490]  to be a four 20 event, but that we can go consume at. Like if I go to a baseball game, I want to be
[25:58.490 --> 26:03.450]  able to go to the smoking section, take a couple of hits off my bowl, put it away, grab some nachos
[26:03.450 --> 26:09.930]  and go back to my seat. And it shouldn't fucking be earth shattering that that's a desire. Yeah.
[26:09.930 --> 26:14.730]  Like half the assholes there in line getting beers. One of my earliest memories, and it's part
[26:14.730 --> 26:19.370]  of the reason I'm not a big fan of organized pro sports is we were in line to get nachos and shit.
[26:19.370 --> 26:24.170]  And dude in front of my dad turned around and just upended four beers over me and my brother.
[26:24.810 --> 26:29.850]  Like dude didn't mean to, he was out 24 bucks or whatever, but we got to enjoy the whole game
[26:29.850 --> 26:36.090]  soaked in beer. So we were like six and eight and like no six and eight year old likes beer. No,
[26:36.090 --> 26:42.170]  it's like, it was just miserable. You're sticky. It's funky. But like, that's a hundred percent
[26:42.170 --> 26:46.170]  cool. And it, it happens at every event everywhere. Why can't there just be a little
[26:46.170 --> 26:51.530]  section for me to go toke at? Like I get no one wanting me to smoke in the seats. Don't be a
[26:51.530 --> 26:58.010]  dick and light up and don't be a fucking Rob Corey. Like I won't dab right by your kids. If you give
[26:58.010 --> 27:03.770]  me a little section, I'll go there. Yeah. I probably won't leave there. Yeah. Let us go off to a side
[27:03.770 --> 27:10.170]  thing. I mean, there's within reason, like if I can't take a water bottle into a venue, I don't
[27:10.170 --> 27:14.090]  think you're going to get away with a dab, breaking the torch, but like a vape pen for
[27:14.090 --> 27:20.730]  concentrates or a fucking joint or a bowl that we've been using, enjoying these at concerts for
[27:20.730 --> 27:25.530]  all of our lives. The idea that we just make a space for that. So we don't have to do it on the
[27:25.530 --> 27:31.770]  download. Why is that fucking nuts? If I had a box seat at a Folsom field in Boulder, right. Those
[27:31.770 --> 27:36.250]  expensive, they're 120 bucks a person for a box, or you can rent the whole box for like three G's
[27:36.250 --> 27:39.930]  or something like that. And you get that box and they bring out a little fridge with shit in it.
[27:39.930 --> 27:46.650]  And then you get free food and drinks and shit. Those are semi-private. What if, should I be able
[27:46.650 --> 27:52.330]  to bring my rig in there and take some dabs in there? Should you? Yes. Are you probably not?
[27:55.370 --> 28:00.490]  You can do it. I'm sure plenty of people have, and I've had that idea before. Like I would love,
[28:00.490 --> 28:03.930]  oh, sorry. That's the torch you guys here. I apologize. There's a couple of events that
[28:03.930 --> 28:09.290]  I'd love to attend. And I've thought about like, you know what? That event's worth taking the time,
[28:09.290 --> 28:14.010]  putting that money aside, getting a box, you know, get eight or 10 friends together,
[28:14.010 --> 28:19.370]  put that planning together. And I mean, if you take a dab, rigging a torch or something where
[28:19.370 --> 28:25.450]  you're vaping rather than burning, you're not going to offend or annoy or even tip off the
[28:25.450 --> 28:31.450]  people in the boxes on either side of you. But, uh, for us to get to a point where this doesn't
[28:31.450 --> 28:36.410]  happen to have has to happen half on the down low, like a lot of people are going to have to stand up
[28:36.410 --> 28:44.570]  and fight. Like no one understands how many of us there are. No one understands how the community
[28:44.570 --> 28:51.530]  operates, what we like, what we don't like. I mean, a third or more of Americans believe
[28:52.090 --> 28:58.730]  the propaganda we got in there. Like a third of Americans are us a third are in the middle
[28:58.730 --> 29:02.010]  and don't really give a shit. And a third are against us. That's just how it works.
[29:02.890 --> 29:07.130]  And unfortunately, most of us have, I mean, we've survived by staying hidden
[29:07.930 --> 29:12.010]  and that's good advice in a lot of places. Keep it quiet or end up in jail.
[29:12.650 --> 29:16.890]  Perfect rant, Mike. I just took the biggest dab of some men. I got half a dab sitting across the
[29:16.890 --> 29:21.130]  table. My gosh, that was so awesome here. I'll heat that up or actually you start heating that up.
[29:21.930 --> 29:27.450]  And I'll get you a little dab. Mike is right. You guys, we do need a lot more, a lot more fighting,
[29:27.450 --> 29:31.770]  a lot more soldiers, but this is what happens when you get legalization. When you regulate something,
[29:32.330 --> 29:36.010]  we are going from an unregulated market where people would bring their backpacks and just
[29:36.010 --> 29:41.210]  hustle it out to a taxed regulated. Oh, I'm trying to kill Mike. I'm giving him a way too big of a
[29:41.210 --> 29:47.210]  dab to a tax regulated market. We kind of voted for this. We kind of asked for this. I talked about
[29:47.210 --> 29:54.490]  it. And as a consumer, I want it. Like I want the, but I'm buying to have a, a, a prior part of its
[29:54.490 --> 30:00.090]  price be lab testing. Yes. Like I like knowing that my shit doesn't have mold or yeast or heavy
[30:00.090 --> 30:07.370]  metals or pesticides. So what I was getting at is when you guys are voting and setting up the
[30:07.930 --> 30:15.370]  rules and regulations for legal cannabis in your area, what we got to do is include somewhere to
[30:15.370 --> 30:19.770]  consume, put consumption in your rules. That's what we missed here. That's what they missed.
[30:19.770 --> 30:24.010]  The big fight in Colorado for the last year has been consumption and we're not going to win for
[30:24.010 --> 30:29.850]  another four or five years. Like Mike said, there are so many places where we can gather. Colorado
[30:29.850 --> 30:35.130]  was a beer state. Colorado loves beer. There's beer everywhere. We can gather everywhere. You
[30:35.130 --> 30:39.690]  can go to the state fair and buy a big ass beer and walk around the state fair and drink a beer.
[30:40.730 --> 30:45.210]  There's kids there. Like Mike said, at the fucking baseball game, he got beer spilled on him. He was
[30:45.210 --> 30:50.490]  a kid. It's unfair. So you're going to have to write that into your rules that there is somewhere
[30:50.490 --> 30:55.850]  where you can consume, consume. We can buy cannabis. We can grow, we can gift, we can share,
[30:56.410 --> 31:01.770]  we can everything but ship and transport, export cannabis here. You could do it all.
[31:01.770 --> 31:06.490]  Mike's going to die. I'm going to turn down your mic, but we can't consume it anywhere.
[31:07.530 --> 31:11.290]  You're not allowed to consume cannabis anywhere. You've got to go home. Even if you're from out
[31:11.290 --> 31:15.050]  of state, you can't consume in your hotel. You've got to get an Airbnb is the only way you can do
[31:15.050 --> 31:19.050]  it. And you've even got to ask the Airbnb people, can we smoke weed in your house? And a lot of
[31:19.050 --> 31:23.050]  them before you even rent it, it will say no cannabis right on the page when you're trying
[31:23.050 --> 31:27.450]  to rent. So that makes sure that when you're writing the rules in your area, I'm going to get
[31:27.450 --> 31:30.730]  your mic back on for you, Mike. Make sure that when you're writing the rules, that when you're
[31:30.730 --> 31:35.450]  setting up the legislation for cannabis in your area, make sure that you include some sort of way
[31:35.450 --> 31:41.290]  to consume. Maybe you allow some sort of smoke clubs. Don't let, don't make it to where we're
[31:41.290 --> 31:46.330]  allowed to smoke weed in the park at 420. Don't do that. Be an adult. Make a designated area.
[31:46.330 --> 31:52.570]  If you want it to actually pass, it has to be smart. Something like Jeff's talking about would
[31:52.570 --> 31:59.530]  have to be is a state rule. It would have to allow local municipalities to opt in or out
[32:01.690 --> 32:08.490]  or define exactly how they wanted it to play in their area. But honestly, I see this evolving
[32:09.210 --> 32:15.450]  sort of like bars in Utah, you've got to be a member or I mean, maybe following the sex club
[32:15.450 --> 32:20.250]  model where it's way the fuck out in the middle of nowhere. And it's only word of mouth. There's
[32:20.250 --> 32:27.930]  no advertising, but like the community needs a place to gather. Yes. And we don't have that now
[32:27.930 --> 32:34.090]  at all. They're stomping down on events. Hardcore right now. Think about, man, I wish, and this is
[32:34.090 --> 32:38.330]  the wrong audience because these people all agree with us. But just think about this. You've got
[32:38.330 --> 32:41.930]  your local bar, right? And we're just going to say it's a biker bar because that's really good
[32:41.930 --> 32:47.290]  for people to visualize. You got this little janky shanty biker bar with some fucking loud ass rock
[32:47.290 --> 32:51.930]  and roll band. I was probably in it playing in the backyard too loud at midnight playing fucking
[32:51.930 --> 32:57.290]  Mustang Sally or seek and destroy way too loud with motorcycles all wind up around the building
[33:00.330 --> 33:05.770]  all night long. Right. Or or you could have a little 420 friendly club, right? A bunch of
[33:05.770 --> 33:10.170]  Volkswagen buses outside, a bunch of people just chill and listen to the Grateful Dead inside.
[33:11.130 --> 33:18.570]  Smells like nachos. They don't get a lot of press. So if you're not me, you don't see a lot of it.
[33:18.570 --> 33:22.730]  Or if you're not like me, you don't see a lot of it. But right now, the anti-pop people, their
[33:22.730 --> 33:30.650]  message is that the high potency products of today cause mental illness and psychosis in like all the
[33:30.650 --> 33:36.890]  mass shooters. It's because they smoke weed. Yeah. Already this fucking the Waffle House dude from
[33:36.890 --> 33:41.850]  today, they're like, yeah, he visited Colorado and he wasn't wearing pants. It must have been the weed
[33:42.570 --> 33:50.650]  like. And yeah, I chuckle because anyone in the community knows it's insane. We've been at the
[33:50.650 --> 33:57.130]  concert with 1500 people smoking pot in a concert venue that holds seven or eight thousand fifteen
[33:57.130 --> 34:02.730]  hundred two thousand people sit there popping. If consuming marijuana just cause people to pop off.
[34:03.690 --> 34:08.410]  Way to fucking notice. Yeah. Yeah. That's what keeps us from popping off. That's what keeps us
[34:08.410 --> 34:15.210]  mellow. That's what keeps us in our place. But for people that have never been part of our community
[34:15.210 --> 34:22.170]  in I mean, I lose sight of it too, because I'm such a. So ingrained into the community like it's
[34:22.170 --> 34:28.330]  I get up, I it's part of my breakfast. It's what I do all day at work. It's what I do when I get home.
[34:29.210 --> 34:35.690]  Like I eat, sleep and breathe it. Yeah. But a lot of people don't like there are people that eat,
[34:35.690 --> 34:43.610]  sleep and breathe football or advertising or newspapers that don't know any really know
[34:43.610 --> 34:51.850]  anything about our community. And when they see shit like. High potency weed causes psychosis.
[34:52.410 --> 35:00.010]  They go, oh, kind of makes sense. And there's not a voice for most people opposing that.
[35:00.970 --> 35:07.290]  And so just, I mean, getting out and just finding those people and being like, hi,
[35:07.290 --> 35:11.530]  I like dabs. Do you see that I'm fucking normal and I show up to my job five days a week and I
[35:11.530 --> 35:16.170]  do a good job while I'm here? And it's just an intoxicant that's different than alcohol that I
[35:17.130 --> 35:23.690]  enjoy. It's not anything miraculous or scary or frightening. Like, please don't outlaw me.
[35:24.810 --> 35:29.050]  Like that's a hard conversation to have in parts of the country where everything's illegal. But
[35:30.170 --> 35:35.290]  if you want shit to progress, like little by little, you have to start breaking down
[35:35.290 --> 35:41.210]  assumptions and prejudices. And it starts by being like, hi, I like weed. I'm completely normal.
[35:41.770 --> 35:46.730]  We can say that this Mendo breath is some of the best concentrates on the planet, right?
[35:46.730 --> 35:51.290]  Yeah. Like I'm not saying that this would win the best concentrate, but this is in the category. I
[35:51.290 --> 35:57.130]  mean, this would be the fun part about being in Colorado is I can confidently and honestly say
[35:57.130 --> 36:02.570]  that right now at the table that I'm sitting at some of the finest concentrates in the history
[36:02.570 --> 36:08.650]  of humankind. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, I'm, we're not, this, my point isn't bragging right now.
[36:08.650 --> 36:13.770]  I've got, I'm bragging a little, there's 12 grams of hash on the table, different flavors,
[36:13.770 --> 36:17.610]  different vendors, different brands, different consistencies. We've got, oh, there's more over
[36:17.610 --> 36:22.090]  there. Mike brought some also. Uh, we've got concentrates. We've got the best concentrates.
[36:22.650 --> 36:28.570]  Did this green dot fucking white Durban. This could win an award. This fucking star killer star
[36:28.570 --> 36:32.890]  child could win an award Mendo breath award winner. All of these could do something. This
[36:32.890 --> 36:40.490]  fucking King Louie put me on my ass. Uh, we probably took six dabs before we recorded like
[36:40.490 --> 36:44.890]  reasonably six days each. Uh, cause I bought, there's, there's seven containers here. We tried
[36:44.890 --> 36:48.890]  almost all of them, uh, right in front of me. And then there's the, we tried this one for sure.
[36:48.890 --> 36:54.330]  We tried, we didn't try this one. Uh, we tried almost everything I bought today. We tried. So
[36:54.330 --> 37:00.890]  we've had two, four, six, seven. We've had at least seven dads. Uh, you feel like going crazy
[37:00.890 --> 37:05.530]  yet? Nope. Just chilling. I say that all the time. I go, Ooh, is that the weed psychosis that
[37:05.530 --> 37:11.850]  I always hear about? Yeah. I could go for, it's not a thing. It's if you, if you really dig into
[37:11.850 --> 37:16.170]  the research, what they're talking about is when you get to the hospital and you've had way too
[37:16.170 --> 37:19.930]  much weed and you're freaking out and you insist that your friends take you to the hospital because
[37:19.930 --> 37:23.930]  you're definitely having a heart attack and you get to the hospital and they're like, do you know
[37:23.930 --> 37:27.690]  what year it is? And you're like, yeah. And you tell them and they're like, okay, how long have
[37:27.690 --> 37:31.930]  you been sitting in this office? And you're like, Oh man, like half an hour, 45 minutes.
[37:31.930 --> 37:36.970]  And it's only been like four minutes. Like that's just you being baked. Yeah. That's the effects of
[37:36.970 --> 37:42.490]  the intoxication. But that's when they say that you're crazy. That's not being able to accurately
[37:42.490 --> 37:48.730]  gauge time as part of being psychotic. Yeah. Okay. And so like it could, it's part of the
[37:48.730 --> 37:53.690]  symptom of a mental illness. And it's, it's one of the reasons that doctors are able to say, Oh,
[37:53.690 --> 37:59.530]  we see weed psychosis all the time. And it's like, well, you see being high. Yeah. Like I
[37:59.530 --> 38:03.290]  can't keep track of time. If I take booze drinks either, I said, take booze drinks.
[38:04.250 --> 38:10.970]  And sometimes this shit can get pretty extreme because we've got some amazing shit right now.
[38:10.970 --> 38:16.090]  And every now and then someone who's never smoked weed before is like, I want to take a really big
[38:16.090 --> 38:21.290]  dab. Like I see him do on YouTube. And so they go to the dispensary, they buy a torch, they buy a
[38:21.290 --> 38:25.770]  rig, they buy a gram of hash, they go home. They try to take a half gram, dad, they cough for five
[38:25.770 --> 38:31.050]  minutes. They lay down on the floor, they sit back up and they freak the fuck out. But it's no
[38:31.050 --> 38:35.210]  different than when you were a teenager and you drank too much and then threw up all over your
[38:35.210 --> 38:40.170]  cousin and then blacked out. And now you can't drink sour apple Pucker no more. I think it's
[38:40.170 --> 38:46.890]  no fucking different, but because this community hides so well, it just plays out so fucking
[38:46.890 --> 38:51.290]  terribly in the press. I was just checking the labels on some of the concentrates that I grabbed
[38:51.290 --> 38:57.850]  today. That one is 92% THC. This one, they're all crumpled up because the way they stick them on
[38:57.850 --> 39:06.490]  the jar, but total cannabinoids, that one only says 78 total 72. Here we go. 95% This is the
[39:06.490 --> 39:12.330]  Lucinda Williams high cannabinoid full spectrum extract. The jar was so sexy. We took pictures.
[39:12.330 --> 39:19.850]  It was basically one giant diamond that weighed a gram and it's 95.8% total giant fucking space
[39:19.850 --> 39:30.090]  rock. So we're smoking the fucking the concentrates. The weed pills, 100% THC.
[39:30.650 --> 39:36.410]  Sativex? Sativex? No, that one, the marinal is what I was saying. Drabiminal or whatever the
[39:36.970 --> 39:43.130]  marinal knockoff is. Marinal is the trade name. But Sativex is the one I'm thinking of. It's the
[39:43.130 --> 39:48.570]  whole plant extract that just got FDA, the next step of FDA approval. Cool. Yeah. No, that's a
[39:48.570 --> 39:53.610]  good thing. Yeah. I think that one was from the UK. Yep. That's from out of Great Britain. Nice.
[39:53.610 --> 39:59.370]  I'm paying attention. GW Pharmaceuticals. Oh, we'll talk about something. If you've watched
[39:59.370 --> 40:05.770]  like the CNN, Weed 1, 2, and 3 specials and a couple other documentaries, you've seen the GW
[40:05.770 --> 40:14.570]  Pharmaceuticals garden and labs. We have a link to that garden. Yep. Yeah. Anyway, Mike, I wanted
[40:14.570 --> 40:19.530]  to give you the opportunity to talk about all the Trump stuff going on. We've been recording for
[40:19.530 --> 40:24.250]  quite a while. If you want to go, I'll give you a good 10 or 15 minutes. I don't need nearly that
[40:24.250 --> 40:34.090]  long. All right. Okay. So everybody's excited that Trump came out pro-weed is how it's kind of
[40:34.090 --> 40:39.450]  being thrown around in the community. And that's sort of what happened, but you'd never trust
[40:39.450 --> 40:50.810]  somebody who's that orange and who says this amount of bullshit. I've never heard Mike make
[40:50.810 --> 40:58.250]  that fucking noise. It's good news, but it's not that good of news. And you never know with Trump,
[40:58.250 --> 41:02.570]  how much this is bullshit and pandering. It's like when your drunk uncle makes promises.
[41:03.370 --> 41:08.490]  Right. Or the guy in the van, like how sweet is the puppy at home? You never really know
[41:08.490 --> 41:14.490]  until you get back to the dude's house. Right. Sounds like he's fallen for that before.
[41:14.490 --> 41:20.010]  Damn. Evil analogies. All right. So he's hinting that he's going to be on our team. Well,
[41:21.530 --> 41:26.170]  there's some run up to this story. Like when Jeff Sessions started really screwing with
[41:26.170 --> 41:31.130]  legal marijuana States and really started threatening a crackdown of some sort,
[41:32.570 --> 41:39.210]  a lot of politicians said, fuck off. And did some things to counter that. One of those things was
[41:39.210 --> 41:45.930]  Colorado Senator Cory Gardner put a hold on a bunch of nominees. And it was like, it's part of
[41:45.930 --> 41:52.970]  my job to approve these guys. If you want to screw with my States voters, having approved recreational
[41:52.970 --> 42:01.530]  cannabis, I'm a screw with your nominations. How do you like me now? And it's been a stalemate
[42:01.530 --> 42:07.450]  kind of going back and forth between a couple of different senators doing stuff like Cory Gardner
[42:07.450 --> 42:15.050]  was doing and the current white house administration over legal cannabis. And it came to a head last
[42:15.050 --> 42:22.810]  week. The long or the short version is it. Trump seems like he really wants to fire somebody, but
[42:22.810 --> 42:29.210]  to do that, he would need Gardner to approve the replacement. And so to get Gardner to start
[42:29.210 --> 42:35.290]  approving people replacements in other appointments, he said that, or Trump said that
[42:35.290 --> 42:41.690]  he would support an amendment similar to the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment or the Rohrabacher-
[42:41.690 --> 42:48.010]  Blumeyer amendment that protects medical marijuana. Basically that amendment says the feds
[42:48.010 --> 42:52.890]  can't spend money to go after legal medical marijuana. If it's following state rules,
[42:53.450 --> 43:00.010]  Trump said he would support a similar amendment covering recreational and throw the weight of
[43:00.010 --> 43:10.410]  the white house behind an amendment like that. On one hand, if Trump is serious and senators submit
[43:10.410 --> 43:16.090]  that amendment and it makes it through committee and it makes it to the floor and it gets voted on
[43:16.090 --> 43:23.210]  and it gets approved by the house and then it lands on Trump's desk as part of a larger bill,
[43:24.410 --> 43:28.490]  that would provide protections for recreational marijuana. There's a lot of steps between-
[43:29.050 --> 43:30.170]  Seven and. Yeah.
[43:30.170 --> 43:33.050]  So that means eight steps. A lot of shit has to happen before
[43:33.770 --> 43:44.090]  this is anything other than a fun idea. But on the upside, it was definitely a yank on Jeff
[43:44.090 --> 43:51.370]  Sessions' leash saying this is wildly inappropriate, a terrible way to spend resources,
[43:52.010 --> 43:59.450]  do something more interesting and that annoys less people. This is the one thing Trump can do is read
[43:59.450 --> 44:06.410]  a poll. Whether you like him or whether you hate him, he's clearly at least employing people who
[44:06.410 --> 44:12.890]  can read public opinion very, very well. And everybody agrees that legalization and
[44:13.770 --> 44:20.410]  liberalization of marijuana laws is very popular right now. So to see the Trump administration
[44:20.410 --> 44:27.290]  have a Jeff Sessions going after us was surprising. Seeing him walk it back was not surprising.
[44:27.290 --> 44:33.530]  I'm definitely keeping a close eye on where this goes. A couple of senators have said they'll go
[44:33.530 --> 44:39.930]  ahead and submit that amendment to protect recreational marijuana like we do medical.
[44:41.050 --> 44:46.330]  Because they've struggled to pass a federal spending bill, the opportunity to slip that
[44:46.330 --> 44:50.090]  shit in there is probably still there. I honestly haven't been following this as closely as I should.
[44:51.130 --> 44:55.690]  Those of you who like me on the podcast know that I've got a kid, I'm about to have another kid.
[44:56.330 --> 44:59.450]  And so I've been kind of busy and slacking on my responsibilities,
[44:59.450 --> 45:01.210]  but I did want to get on and say something about-
[45:01.930 --> 45:04.090]  You're not slacking on anything, brother.
[45:04.090 --> 45:07.690]  They're called priorities and you've got them in order. It's all right. It's okay.
[45:08.330 --> 45:13.690]  Earlier in the live feed, somebody was like, can white Mike do a state by state breakdown and
[45:13.690 --> 45:20.010]  how the non-legalization states are faring? And I was like, I could, I can't right now.
[45:20.010 --> 45:21.770]  Give me like a week, I'll start writing.
[45:22.810 --> 45:27.610]  I'd need more than a week right now, honestly. I'm so behind on that. I've been running two
[45:27.610 --> 45:30.570]  facilities instead of researching.
[45:30.570 --> 45:34.090]  Yes, we are running 77 and 83 is what we call them.
[45:34.650 --> 45:39.290]  If anybody listening would like further clarification or has specific questions,
[45:39.290 --> 45:43.850]  feel free to tweet me at NemoPunk15 or hit me up on Facebook at
[45:43.850 --> 45:47.530]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws. I'm happy to interact with you on those platforms and
[45:48.090 --> 45:52.170]  answer your political questions, political weed questions.
[45:52.170 --> 45:56.970]  So how long, you said it's got to jump through those eight hoops before it actually lands on
[45:56.970 --> 45:59.610]  his desk. How do you have a timeline for that? And I'm going to take a dab.
[45:59.610 --> 46:07.770]  It can happen relatively quickly, like in a matter of weeks, or it could take a year or two.
[46:07.770 --> 46:10.170]  Like it just, government's like that.
[46:10.170 --> 46:14.730]  Okay. And this guy's got a lot of ADD and it doesn't have anything to do with his dick or
[46:14.730 --> 46:16.570]  his ego, so it could get pushed aside. Right?
[46:16.570 --> 46:23.050]  Well, and that's the thing. Like, if this was something that President Trump decided he was
[46:23.050 --> 46:28.890]  going to make his number one issue, and he was going to spend most of his time focused right now
[46:28.890 --> 46:34.410]  on making sure that marijuana legalization happened or something, it would still take him
[46:34.410 --> 46:40.010]  at least the rest of this term to make it happen. Just with the amount of steps that have to happen
[46:40.010 --> 46:45.450]  for it to go from something that people want to make happen to something that is,
[46:46.090 --> 46:50.170]  there's a lot of steps, a lot of steps.
[46:50.170 --> 46:53.610]  You guys, I just took a really big dab of really potent marijuana concentrate.
[46:55.050 --> 46:56.650]  Still don't feel like fucking anything up.
[46:56.650 --> 46:57.530]  That was big.
[46:57.530 --> 47:01.130]  I might fuck up some ice cream. If you got some Ben and Jerry's, that shit would be in trouble.
[47:02.410 --> 47:04.330]  But that's the only thing I feel like doing any harm to.
[47:04.330 --> 47:06.650]  I hadn't moved one of my feet in like an hour.
[47:08.650 --> 47:13.130]  Oh, you feeling all right over there? This will help. This is the Sour Pez Live Resin Ambrosia.
[47:13.930 --> 47:17.610]  It tastes like grapefruit and cotton candy at the same time. Kind of weird.
[47:17.610 --> 47:18.170]  I enjoy it.
[47:18.170 --> 47:19.210]  It looks like fucking honey.
[47:19.210 --> 47:20.730]  It is very turpy.
[47:20.730 --> 47:23.930]  I tried to get you a nice crystal and some turps, but I know you choke at everything.
[47:23.930 --> 47:25.450]  So I didn't go too hard.
[47:26.090 --> 47:29.770]  You guys, while I heat up this dab now, I'm going to try to get it a little further from the mic
[47:29.770 --> 47:30.330]  so I can talk.
[47:31.050 --> 47:33.530]  I want to thank Mike for keeping us up to date politically.
[47:33.530 --> 47:37.290]  I know some people get fucking bored of hearing about the political rants and the politics,
[47:37.290 --> 47:40.410]  but that is a huge part of cannabis activism.
[47:40.410 --> 47:41.290]  What's going on?
[47:41.290 --> 47:44.250]  Being informed and staying aware is really important.
[47:44.250 --> 47:45.610]  Some of you guys might not care.
[47:45.610 --> 47:46.970]  A lot of you really do care.
[47:46.970 --> 47:49.290]  So I appreciate it when Mike comes on and shares that stuff with us.
[47:50.090 --> 47:51.530]  It's super important, y'all.
[47:54.570 --> 47:58.570]  When I hear people say that they don't vote for this reason or that reason,
[47:59.690 --> 48:00.890]  I want to slap them.
[48:01.610 --> 48:04.490]  You would a little kid who was yanking their sister's hair.
[48:05.210 --> 48:07.610]  There's a lot of times you ask me to edit shit out of the podcast.
[48:07.610 --> 48:08.970]  Is that going to be one of the things?
[48:08.970 --> 48:13.850]  No, it's just our democracy works because people participate in it.
[48:13.930 --> 48:20.250]  The reason cannabis consumers get shit on by so many different segments of society
[48:20.250 --> 48:25.370]  is because we haven't participated in the system since the 60s.
[48:27.050 --> 48:28.170]  Get out of the system.
[48:28.170 --> 48:35.770]  Fuck the system became one of our cornerstone values and it cost us a lot.
[48:36.730 --> 48:47.850]  We never had an organized group fighting for protections or rights or anything.
[48:49.530 --> 48:50.970]  We had exactly the opposite.
[48:50.970 --> 48:56.890]  We had an endless number of groups who made a career out of demonizing our community.
[49:01.460 --> 49:05.460]  We're villains in almost every way, politically.
[49:06.260 --> 49:08.420]  That's because of our non-participation.
[49:08.420 --> 49:10.260]  I need to take this before it gets any colder.
[49:10.260 --> 49:13.060]  For far too long, our representatives were Cheech and Chong.
[49:14.820 --> 49:15.380]  I love Cheech.
[49:15.380 --> 49:16.020]  I love Chong.
[49:16.020 --> 49:16.740]  Much respect.
[49:16.740 --> 49:17.620]  They did a lot.
[49:17.620 --> 49:20.980]  If it was them, not their characters in the movies, it would be different,
[49:20.980 --> 49:22.660]  but it was their characters in the movies.
[49:22.660 --> 49:23.160]  Right.
[49:24.420 --> 49:27.380]  That was the exact stereotype that we did not need.
[49:27.380 --> 49:29.860]  That was what made people say, well, look at those burnouts.
[49:29.860 --> 49:30.660]  Look at those stoners.
[49:30.660 --> 49:32.500]  That's why we don't want it legal.
[49:32.500 --> 49:33.860]  For far too long, we had that.
[49:34.420 --> 49:44.340]  Until the people of our generation came along.
[49:44.340 --> 49:48.980]  And I think things started to change with maybe the kids right before me,
[49:48.980 --> 49:51.300]  and then our generation, and then the people after us.
[49:51.300 --> 49:52.260]  They feel so entitled.
[49:52.260 --> 49:53.700]  They're like, we want legal marijuana.
[49:53.700 --> 49:56.020]  So they just went out and fucking tried to make it happen.
[49:56.020 --> 49:58.900]  And it seems to be working in a lot of the places.
[50:00.100 --> 50:01.620]  So it just took time for people to wake up.
[50:01.620 --> 50:06.660]  And then social media really helped with the activism and waking up people.
[50:07.540 --> 50:14.100]  Because a lot of cannabis consumers, advocates, speakers, we're better off at home.
[50:14.100 --> 50:15.540]  We don't do so well going out.
[50:15.540 --> 50:19.940]  So being able to speak our opinions from the comfort of our own recording studio really
[50:19.940 --> 50:20.500]  helps us out.
[50:24.020 --> 50:24.980]  We made it worse.
[50:26.180 --> 50:28.980]  I mean, we had to hide for our own safety.
[50:29.940 --> 50:33.540]  And we preached dropping out and getting out of the system and fuck Babylon.
[50:34.180 --> 50:42.580]  And that allowed groups to pass all sorts of rules so that if we dared to stand up and
[50:42.580 --> 50:49.620]  identify ourselves as parts of this community, we'd risk school funding, housing opportunities,
[50:50.900 --> 50:54.260]  job opportunities, freedom opportunities.
[50:54.260 --> 50:54.740]  Freedom.
[50:54.740 --> 50:54.980]  Yeah.
[50:55.860 --> 50:57.220]  The Grovers would be arrested.
[50:57.220 --> 50:57.700]  The activists would be shunned.
[50:57.700 --> 51:03.220]  I remember reading about grow houses getting busted when I was like six and eight, where
[51:03.220 --> 51:09.700]  people that were growing under fucking stolen streetlights in their basement, people cropping
[51:09.700 --> 51:12.020]  out way back in like 92, 94.
[51:13.460 --> 51:24.340]  And if you look at the numbers and do the math, people's best guess is like 35 to 60
[51:24.420 --> 51:28.740]  billion dollars in herb gets purchased coast to coast.
[51:28.740 --> 51:29.060]  Wow.
[51:29.780 --> 51:32.820]  And if you it's about the size of the cosmetics industry.
[51:33.860 --> 51:37.140]  And so if you look at, I mean, just think about that for a minute.
[51:37.140 --> 51:41.620]  How many places do you see cosmetics period, like eyeshadow, lipstick, all that shit.
[51:42.340 --> 51:44.980]  Walgreens, Target, Walmart, fucking everywhere.
[51:44.980 --> 51:45.860]  This store is where I go.
[51:45.860 --> 51:47.860]  And then you've got the places where I got to take my daughter.
[51:48.740 --> 51:50.980]  Claire's Forever 21, Sephira.
[51:50.980 --> 51:51.380]  Yeah.
[51:51.380 --> 51:52.020]  She stepped up.
[51:52.020 --> 51:53.220]  She doesn't go to Claire's anymore, bro.
[51:53.220 --> 51:55.220]  You're going to take her to Sephora or whatever.
[51:55.220 --> 51:56.820]  It's a massive industry.
[51:56.820 --> 51:57.860]  It's everywhere.
[51:57.860 --> 52:05.460]  It requires thousands of companies, tens of thousands of employees, massive amounts of
[52:05.460 --> 52:08.500]  like trucks and boxes and people and shipping.
[52:08.500 --> 52:12.020]  And now do that with weed.
[52:13.060 --> 52:19.700]  So you can kind of do the math and weed in your area and figure out how many individual.
[52:19.700 --> 52:20.340]  Hey, bro.
[52:20.340 --> 52:22.500]  Oh, so you'll take an ounce of sour diesel.
[52:22.500 --> 52:22.740]  Cool.
[52:23.220 --> 52:28.580]  That'll be like, how many of those transactions have to take place?
[52:29.220 --> 52:35.860]  If you've got 150 plant house grow, how many of those house grows are required to supply
[52:36.500 --> 52:41.460]  80% of the demand coast to coast, which is estimated what we're producing coast to coast
[52:41.460 --> 52:42.660]  and 20% import.
[52:42.660 --> 52:44.820]  Now it used to be the other way.
[52:44.820 --> 52:45.380]  Right.
[52:45.380 --> 52:49.460]  And slowly the demand for domestic grown is pushed out the import market.
[52:49.460 --> 52:57.940]  But when you look at all of that commerce, shifting that into a legal market is freaking
[52:57.940 --> 52:59.140]  out all sorts of things.
[53:00.900 --> 53:06.820]  And one of the opportunities we have right now is there's this little window where people
[53:06.820 --> 53:15.220]  who weren't real deep into the black market can stand up and fight right now without risking
[53:15.220 --> 53:15.860]  too much.
[53:16.820 --> 53:23.140]  And like I was one of those people when Colorado was on the cusp and I remember agonizing over,
[53:24.020 --> 53:26.420]  can I be the person who stands up?
[53:27.300 --> 53:33.060]  Because the odds that you get hammered down when you're the first one to stand up are
[53:33.060 --> 53:33.620]  huge.
[53:34.340 --> 53:39.940]  And in Pueblo, the only people talking for us were really bad at talking for the community.
[53:40.580 --> 53:45.380]  And they needed someone who could put a whole sentence together to stand up and speak for
[53:46.020 --> 53:47.300]  legal cannabis.
[53:47.300 --> 53:52.500]  And I attended meeting after meeting where no one showed up and was able to do that.
[53:53.300 --> 53:55.460]  And finally I broke and was like, fuck it.
[53:55.460 --> 54:02.340]  Like maybe I have to get really creative for employment from here on out and just know
[54:02.340 --> 54:07.780]  that I'm never going to work for anybody who does a Google search first because to stand
[54:07.780 --> 54:13.860]  up and speak about legal cannabis and the need to legalize it in any way marks you as
[54:13.860 --> 54:14.820]  a target.
[54:14.820 --> 54:16.820]  And that's still true in a lot of the country.
[54:17.540 --> 54:23.940]  And so to have the balls to stand up in a place like Alabama, Georgia, Texas, and really
[54:23.940 --> 54:24.900]  fight right now.
[54:24.900 --> 54:27.460]  I mean, it takes like soldiers, a good word.
[54:28.180 --> 54:29.460]  It takes a set of balls.
[54:29.460 --> 54:30.500]  It takes a skill set.
[54:30.500 --> 54:31.620]  It takes dedication.
[54:32.260 --> 54:34.180]  Like you need to be doing your research.
[54:34.180 --> 54:35.940]  You need to know how the process works.
[54:36.500 --> 54:40.580]  You can't go and propose that the people you're talking to do shit they don't have the power
[54:40.580 --> 54:40.900]  to do.
[54:42.100 --> 54:44.180]  Please don't take them marijuana.
[54:45.300 --> 54:47.860]  It's just, it's not, it doesn't go over well.
[54:48.420 --> 54:49.060]  It's weird.
[54:51.300 --> 54:55.060]  Like when people come and talk to them about a restaurant, they say, come to my restaurant.
[54:55.060 --> 54:56.420]  They don't just show up with food.
[54:57.460 --> 54:59.300]  It should be the same way with cannabis.
[54:59.300 --> 55:00.660]  Go tell them what you're about.
[55:00.660 --> 55:03.220]  Let them know where to come to check out and find out more.
[55:03.220 --> 55:05.620]  Don't just show up and be like, here's an eighth, everybody.
[55:08.020 --> 55:09.220]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[55:09.220 --> 55:09.940]  I've heard about it.
[55:09.940 --> 55:10.420]  I've seen it.
[55:11.780 --> 55:13.300]  It take your time.
[55:13.300 --> 55:16.100]  If you really want to get up and fight, you don't know how contact me.
[55:16.100 --> 55:16.900]  I will help.
[55:16.900 --> 55:18.020]  How can they contact you, Mike?
[55:18.980 --> 55:20.260]  Lots of ways.
[55:20.260 --> 55:25.940]  You can hit me up on Twitter at at Nemopunk15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[55:25.940 --> 55:26.420]  laws.
[55:26.420 --> 55:27.380]  That's the best way to do it.
[55:27.380 --> 55:29.540]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on the Facebook.
[55:29.540 --> 55:33.220]  Everybody hearing this is going to try to find me on Instagram, which one of these days
[55:33.220 --> 55:34.020]  I'm gonna learn how to work.
[55:34.980 --> 55:36.340]  Mike's not much of an Instagrammer.
[55:36.340 --> 55:38.580]  That's more, that's more my thing.
[55:38.580 --> 55:40.980]  Mike, thanks for coming and keeping us up to date politically.
[55:40.980 --> 55:42.020]  I appreciate that, dude.
[55:42.020 --> 55:43.620]  Yeah, thanks for listening to the rants, you guys.
[55:43.620 --> 55:48.420]  That feels like it was a lot, but I'm really baked right now in my ability to judge times.
[55:48.420 --> 55:49.140]  A little hinky.
[55:49.140 --> 55:50.820]  Well, hey, are you psychotic?
[55:50.820 --> 55:52.340]  You falling into that psychosis?
[55:52.340 --> 55:55.060]  It's called Cannabis News, Education and Conversation.
[55:55.060 --> 55:56.500]  And I feel like we got all three today.
[55:56.500 --> 56:00.420]  There was news, there was edumacation, and there was lots of conversation.
[56:00.420 --> 56:01.940]  So I think we nailed it.
[56:01.940 --> 56:03.380]  I think we did pretty well.
[56:03.380 --> 56:05.540]  If you didn't like this episode, the best part...
[56:05.540 --> 56:06.340]  What to dab next.
[56:06.340 --> 56:08.980]  If you didn't like this episode, the best part is there will be another one Thursday.
[56:08.980 --> 56:10.820]  So you'll just get the lesson again Thursday.
[56:10.820 --> 56:12.660]  Maybe I'll say something you like on that episode.
[56:12.660 --> 56:14.020]  And if you liked it, hey, thank you.
[56:14.020 --> 56:15.300]  I appreciate you for hanging out.
[56:16.180 --> 56:19.220]  I want to give a huge shout out to a couple of friends of mine.
[56:20.180 --> 56:21.540]  The Dude and Scotty.
[56:21.540 --> 56:22.340]  What's up, gentlemen?
[56:22.900 --> 56:26.580]  Every episode, The Dude and Scotty give an award or a shout out, they call it, to...
[56:26.580 --> 56:28.420]  They name somebody the executive producer.
[56:29.060 --> 56:32.900]  They just say, this person is called the executive producer for this episode.
[56:32.900 --> 56:36.580]  Two times now, I have been titled the executive producer.
[56:36.580 --> 56:42.420]  The post-Dude Grows Cup episode, Scotty gave me the executive producer title.
[56:42.980 --> 56:46.500]  He's like, I ran into Rasta Jeff, big tall dude with dreadlocks,
[56:46.500 --> 56:49.540]  with always has a smile on his face and a positive attitude,
[56:50.340 --> 56:52.260]  which that's a huge compliment.
[56:52.260 --> 56:53.620]  It's kind of what I'm aiming for.
[56:53.620 --> 56:56.100]  Try to have a big smile, try to be chilling, having a good time.
[56:57.380 --> 56:58.580]  Scotty, it's always fun hanging out with you.
[56:58.580 --> 57:01.940]  So thanks for the executive producer title.
[57:01.940 --> 57:03.780]  I think I gave Scotty too big of a dab.
[57:03.780 --> 57:06.420]  He got a little bit wrecked at The Dude Grows Cup, but that's what we do.
[57:06.580 --> 57:07.700]  It's what the cup is for.
[57:07.700 --> 57:08.580]  That's the truth.
[57:08.580 --> 57:11.220]  But when you're hosting and you're that lit, it's a challenge, I'm sure.
[57:11.220 --> 57:12.180]  He's like, hi, everybody.
[57:12.180 --> 57:13.060]  I'm lit.
[57:13.060 --> 57:15.700]  Long enough to have, I can perform a rap set later.
[57:15.700 --> 57:16.900]  Ooh, I'm not going there.
[57:17.540 --> 57:23.220]  So, shout out to Scotty Real for the love and respect for giving me the executive producer
[57:23.220 --> 57:23.700]  position.
[57:23.700 --> 57:24.980]  It's always good to see you, bro.
[57:24.980 --> 57:26.020]  It's always good to hang out.
[57:26.020 --> 57:27.380]  It's always good to take a dab.
[57:27.380 --> 57:28.900]  Let's do a podcast together.
[57:30.020 --> 57:33.300]  Also, on the same token, shout out to The Dude.
[57:33.300 --> 57:36.980]  There was a Grow competition called the Adam Dunn Show Invitational.
[57:36.980 --> 57:41.460]  I'm sure a lot of my friends listened to the Adam Dunn Show podcast and also The Dude Grows
[57:41.460 --> 57:42.260]  podcast, I hope.
[57:42.980 --> 57:48.740]  But The Dude from The Dude Grows Show actually placed in the Adam Dunn Show Invitational.
[57:48.740 --> 57:48.980]  Yeah.
[57:49.540 --> 57:54.100]  So that's super cool to see one of our Grow gurus actually place in a contest.
[57:54.100 --> 57:55.300]  I think that's pretty awesome.
[57:55.300 --> 57:56.260]  So it should be.
[57:56.260 --> 57:57.540]  Shout out to The Dude.
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.900]  Shout out to Scotty Real.
[57:58.900 --> 58:01.380]  Shout out to everybody in The Dude Grows crew.
[58:01.380 --> 58:06.180]  Since I have been hanging out with The Dude Grows crew more and since I went to the event,
[58:06.180 --> 58:10.100]  my Instagram live feeds have been much more full.
[58:10.100 --> 58:12.180]  The Dude Grows crew comes in and hangs out there.
[58:12.740 --> 58:14.260]  I'm getting a lot more interactions.
[58:14.260 --> 58:15.620]  So shout out to all those people.
[58:15.620 --> 58:16.820]  And big shout out to everybody.
[58:17.540 --> 58:18.020]  Excuse me.
[58:18.020 --> 58:19.140]  Sorry for the throat clearing.
[58:19.140 --> 58:19.540]  Hold on.
[58:22.180 --> 58:23.060]  Big shout out to everybody.
[58:23.060 --> 58:23.940]  Yeah, I did turn off the mic.
[58:23.940 --> 58:25.460]  That wasn't me this time.
[58:25.460 --> 58:25.700]  Yeah.
[58:26.340 --> 58:29.380]  Big shout out to everybody that comes through and hangs out on my Instagram live videos.
[58:29.380 --> 58:31.460]  If you're not checking those out on Instagram, I'm Irie.
[58:31.460 --> 58:32.580]  You should be checking those out.
[58:32.580 --> 58:34.660]  Yes, it's Irie underscore genetics.
[58:34.660 --> 58:37.860]  I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[58:37.860 --> 58:39.140]  Irie Genetics on Instagram.
[58:39.140 --> 58:40.020]  Make sure you check me out.
[58:40.020 --> 58:41.540]  I do a lot of live feeds.
[58:41.540 --> 58:43.860]  I go talk about growing cannabis, consuming cannabis.
[58:43.860 --> 58:46.740]  I take a lot of dabs on there because it's not a podcast.
[58:46.740 --> 58:47.220]  They get loose.
[58:47.220 --> 58:47.780]  I'm just chilling.
[58:47.780 --> 58:48.500]  There's no headphones.
[58:48.500 --> 58:49.620]  There's no microphone.
[58:49.620 --> 58:51.300]  It's me and my dab rig.
[58:51.300 --> 58:53.140]  There's people asking questions about weed.
[58:53.140 --> 58:56.100]  I write down some of the questions and they actually make it here to the podcast.
[58:56.100 --> 58:58.580]  A lot of times I just answer shit on the fly.
[58:58.580 --> 58:59.300]  It's a lot of fun.
[58:59.300 --> 59:00.660]  So make sure you check me out there, you guys.
[59:00.660 --> 59:01.620]  I think you would enjoy it.
[59:01.620 --> 59:02.820]  But shout out to all my friends.
[59:02.820 --> 59:03.460]  That was the point.
[59:03.460 --> 59:06.020]  Shout out to Scotty and shout out to the dude.
[59:07.220 --> 59:09.380]  All right, you guys, let's start wrapping up this podcast.
[59:10.100 --> 59:13.060]  I would appreciate it if you follow me on all of the social media.
[59:13.060 --> 59:14.100]  Find me on Facebook.
[59:14.100 --> 59:14.740]  It's Irie.
[59:14.740 --> 59:15.780]  No, it's not Irie Genetics.
[59:15.780 --> 59:17.140]  It's the fucking Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[59:18.100 --> 59:19.300]  Follow Irie Genetics also.
[59:19.300 --> 59:19.940]  You should.
[59:19.940 --> 59:21.140]  The more clicks, the merrier.
[59:21.140 --> 59:22.900]  So go find all my stuff on Instagram.
[59:22.900 --> 59:23.940]  Just stalk me.
[59:23.940 --> 59:24.900]  Facebook, Instagram.
[59:24.900 --> 59:26.660]  On Facebook, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[59:27.620 --> 59:29.940]  Find Irie Genetics on Twitter.
[59:29.940 --> 59:30.900]  There are a lot of options.

[59:31.540 --> 59:33.060]  I'm rostagef420.
[59:33.060 --> 59:33.780]  Check me out.
[59:33.780 --> 59:34.900]  You can find the podcast.
[59:34.900 --> 59:36.660]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[59:36.660 --> 59:38.100]  You can find Irie Genetics.
[59:38.100 --> 59:39.460]  It's Irie Genetics.
[59:39.460 --> 59:40.980]  Lots of stuff to click on there.
[59:40.980 --> 59:44.100]  If you've got something to say, if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[59:44.900 --> 59:48.020]  if you'd like to send me a product to review, if you'd like to...
[59:48.020 --> 59:49.220]  If you've got a question.
[59:49.220 --> 59:52.500]  Yeah, if you've got a question, if you want to know something
[59:52.500 --> 59:55.540]  and you're not into all this social media stuff, if you're not hip on that,
[59:55.540 --> 59:56.500]  you can send me an email.
[59:56.500 --> 59:59.220]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.620]  I would love to see what you've got to say.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:05.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got 242 videos on YouTube now.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.100]  Well, you did the spouting.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:08.820]  I did.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.260]  The last time I checked, YouTube is going and chopping down
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.260]  a lot of cannabis-related pages.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.140]  Fortunately for me, my videos don't have a lot of cannabis happening.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:17.780]  It's just audio.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.940]  It's a picture of my ugly mug and audio.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.220]  Maybe I'll slip through.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.260]  Maybe they'll let me live.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.380]  Maybe they'll let me keep going.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.820]  But if I were a different type of channel, they wouldn't take me down.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.580]  Why do they want to take down the cannabis channels?
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.340]  The internet is doing...
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.100]  There's a little smut purge.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.580]  Personal ads on Craigslist disappeared.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:44.900]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.260]  The personal section's gone.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:52.900]  When I walked in, you were listening to a show who mentioned that a popular
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.780]  message board for escorts in LA is gone now.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.100]  Yep.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.940]  Shout out to Philo Vaughn and his podcast.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.220]  I love that fucking podcast.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.460]  There's a couple of different social media platforms that are purging
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.860]  cannabis or gun-related.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.180]  I don't say those two.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.580]  It's just both of those purchases are happening right now.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.260]  And it's happening for a variety of reasons.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:22.180]  It's unfortunate, but at the same time, we're a community that operates in the
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.940]  shadows and as such, we're subject to getting shit on regularly.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.300]  Step out of the shadows.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.700]  Yeah, if they thought they were going to receive some sort of backlash for
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:36.500]  deleting the content we enjoy and produce, they wouldn't be doing that.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.340]  I just got a message from somebody sending me a YouTube link.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:40.980]  That's funny.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.820]  Shout out to the person that just sent me a YouTube link.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.220]  I hope my channel is still there.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.420]  All right, guys, find me on YouTube.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.860]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.500]  Watch the old videos while they're still there.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.300]  Start with number one.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.580]  It's on a shared playlist.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.500]  Start with number one and watch as many as you can before YouTube yanks them down.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:01.860]  I will keep producing them and I'll put them up, but I can't guarantee what YouTube will do.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.940]  We'll figure it out from there if YouTube fucks me over.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.620]  Also, you guys, don't forget about Patreon.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.380]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.420]  If you felt like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks and you would like to contribute,

[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.540]  All of the information that you need will be right there.

[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.260]  You can contribute to the podcast.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.140]  What I do with those contributions is I pay for my website.
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.380]  I've got a website where I host the podcast.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.420]  That allows me to give you the podcast for free.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.460]  There are people that are able to contribute to help me out so that I can keep the show
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.980]  coming for everybody for free.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.900]  If you can do so, I would appreciate it.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.500]  If you can't, I still love you.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.220]  Keep listening.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:37.940]  Keep smoking.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:38.820]  Keep hanging out.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.340]  Keep following me on all the social media.
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.220]  We're still friends.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.900]  They're just people that want to contribute.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.340]  I'm giving them a way to do it.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:44.900]  And thank you.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.380]  Thank you to everybody who wants to contribute.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.460]  Big thank you to everybody who has contributed.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:52.740]  And thank you to everybody who will contribute in the future when the time is right for you.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.260]  The time may not be right by now.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.620]  You might win the fucking lottery or something.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.220]  And then you'd be like, oh, now I know what he means.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.260]  I got five extra bucks.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.540]  I'm going to go contribute.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.220]  You'll know what I'm talking about when the time comes.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.900]  If you can't afford it, dude, I still love you.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.700]  I understand.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.220]  We all don't have five extra dollars.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.980]  Some of us don't have a fucking spare dollar.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.860]  So do what you have to do.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.100]  Some of us are just trying to medicate and get by.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:10.820]  Don't worry about it.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.620]  Someone's got your back.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:11.940]  I do.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.740]  This struggle's real.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.540]  Don't sweat it.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.420]  That's the truth.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.820]  Uh, shout out to everybody from Patreon.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:22.020]  The MacBook that this show was being recorded on is going so slow that it's fucking frustrating.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:27.620]  You guys, I did, uh, use some of my own personal funds, but I did use a large portion of Patreon
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.540]  funding to buy a new MacBook.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.940]  I've recorded several episodes on the new MacBook Pro.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.180]  I've made a lot of YouTube videos with it.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.780]  I cannot believe how much faster, how much more quickly.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.660]  It made life better.
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.860]  Did it made life better?
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.500]  I can edit.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.300]  I can fucking edit.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.740]  I don't have to sit there and watch the little fucking Mac wheel go and spin around.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.100]  I can edit now and I can do multiple shows so much easier.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.020]  So I guess metric needs a new MacBook.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:50.340]  Yes.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:50.740]  Yes.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.340]  If you guys work in metric, you'll know what I mean.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.260]  But anyway, thank you guys for the contributions.
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.860]  You did help me get a new MacBook Pro.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.700]  Things are going much more smoothly.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.220]  I appreciate all of your help.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:03:59.540]  Thank you.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:03:59.860]  Thank you.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:00.180]  Thank you.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.300]  I can't say it enough.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.860]  I know what it's like to reach into your pocket and help somebody out.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.460]  It feels good and it takes some effort.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:06.180]  So thank you.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:06.980]  I appreciate that.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.220]  Um, you guys, I think that's all of the rambles I have got for this week.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.500]  Mike, do you got anything to say before we, uh, say goodbye to these fine people?
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.580]  He's got the blankest look on his face.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.780]  You guys be good to one another.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.900]  Lots of rants.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.980]  Um, keep the questions coming.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.220]  Yeah.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:23.780]  Keep them coming.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.340]  Please.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.580]  You wonder why I took the rant that way?
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.020]  50% of the time for this episode tonight, it's because of the Facebook live before the show.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.060]  Oh, the Instagram live feed?
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:33.780]  The Instagram live.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.020]  Yeah.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:34.900]  Not Facebook live.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.860]  That's how high I am.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.500]  That's all right.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.500]  Uh, once those are over, I forgot them.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.780]  People were like, Hey, remember you said this?
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.940]  I'm like, nah, I just go so fast in those.
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.100]  I'm fielding four and five questions at a time.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.180]  And so my brain is firing in a really weird way.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.340]  And once it's over, I go into like a weird recovery mode.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:48.900]  I have to-
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.060]  Watching the lag in person is funny because I've got the feed up in front of me and I see you in
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.860]  person.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.740]  So sometimes it gets a little hanky.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:01.540]  I feel like when the show, when the live feeds are over, the little, the driver inside my head
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.940]  has to go put all the files back in the folders and put them back.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.740]  Like, Oh God, I needed a minute to put all this shit back.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.660]  That was so many files at once.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.140]  Like, yeah.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:13.300]  So I just kind of decompress after those for a minute, take a couple more dabs and wipe it off.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.580]  All right, you guys, I want to thank everybody for hanging out.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.620]  Of course, I'll be back Thursday with, uh, I've been calling them quickies, but they've
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.380]  been normal, fully fucking episodes lately.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.820]  Once I get talking, I just get going, but I should be back Thursday with another episode.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.340]  I want to thank everybody for hanging out.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.100]  I want to send a huge thanks to Mike for coming and taking time from his family, uh, from the
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.740]  wife, the baby, the dog, the new baby that's on the way.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.700]  You've got a lot to think about.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.100]  So thanks for being here, wasting time with my ugly ass.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:36.580]  Yeah, man.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.300]  Um, I think that's, we all we've got for this week.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.380]  Hey, I've got a super important shout out this week.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.020]  I want to give a huge birthday shout out.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.460]  Happy birthday, bro.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.900]  I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.660]  I hope you have the greatest birthday.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.460]  I hope you have a great time.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.660]  I hope everything goes your way.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.860]  I hope you're taking fat dabs.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.140]  I hope you're smoking fat joints.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.860]  I hope whatever you're doing, you got a big smile on your face because you're a good fucking
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.540]  dude and you deserve it.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.660]  So huge birthday shout out to my friend bag seed, Jesse.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.020]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
