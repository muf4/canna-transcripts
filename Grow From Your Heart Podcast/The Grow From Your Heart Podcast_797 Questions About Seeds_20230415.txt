[00:03.070 --> 00:25.150]  Yeah, welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:25.150 --> 00:26.910]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.910 --> 00:31.830]  This is episode 797 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:31.830 --> 00:33.910]  I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[00:33.910 --> 00:36.750]  In this episode, I'm going to give away free seeds.
[00:36.750 --> 00:41.830]  That's right, I've teamed up with seedsherenow.com to give away free iRegenetic seeds.
[00:41.830 --> 00:45.110]  We'll talk more about the free seed giveaway later in this episode.
[00:45.110 --> 00:49.350]  This is the time when I do want to remind you that Team iRegenetics will be at the Dude
[00:49.350 --> 00:53.310]  Grows Cup on June 3rd in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[00:53.310 --> 00:56.110]  I do invite you to come join us at the Dude Grows Cup.
[00:56.110 --> 01:00.670]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all of that information.
[01:00.670 --> 01:02.830]  Also make sure you check out iRedirect.com.
[01:02.830 --> 01:06.310]  There are a lot of great things on sale on iRedirect.com.
[01:06.310 --> 01:09.510]  There's a bunch of Femme seeds and regular seeds at blowout pricing for the month of
[01:09.510 --> 01:10.510]  April.
[01:10.510 --> 01:13.150]  I just added a couple of new strains.
[01:13.150 --> 01:15.950]  Make sure you go check out the website, iRedirect.com.
[01:15.950 --> 01:20.590]  Grab some of those new seeds, the fresh drops, and the fresh restock at blowout pricing.
[01:20.590 --> 01:23.950]  All right, I think that's all of the business we have got to cover here at the top of the
[01:23.950 --> 01:24.950]  show.
[01:24.950 --> 01:28.710]  Let's jump into the email and questions portion, part of this podcast.
[01:28.710 --> 01:31.670]  I do have a great question here right in front of me.
[01:31.670 --> 01:36.350]  This one came from the iRedirect website with the question submission form right on
[01:36.350 --> 01:37.910]  the iRedirect website.
[01:37.910 --> 01:39.910]  There is a tab that says Grow Help or Questions.
[01:39.910 --> 01:43.190]  If you click on that, you are able to send me a grow question.
[01:43.190 --> 01:48.230]  If I do read that grow question here on the podcast, you win a free pack of iReed genetic
[01:48.230 --> 01:49.230]  seeds.
[01:49.230 --> 01:52.510]  Of course, that giveaway is sponsored by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[01:52.510 --> 01:56.630]  This first question from the Grow Help tab came from our friend Brent, and it goes a
[01:56.630 --> 01:58.670]  little bit like this.
[01:58.670 --> 01:59.670]  It says,
[01:59.670 --> 02:00.670]  Hey, this is a shout out to Jeff.
[02:00.670 --> 02:03.310]  I love your work, and I love every single episode you have put out.
[02:03.310 --> 02:04.310]  Well, thanks a lot.
[02:04.310 --> 02:06.710]  That's a great compliment and a good way to start an email.
[02:06.710 --> 02:10.470]  It says, I can't thank you enough for what I have learned from you.
[02:10.470 --> 02:11.670]  That is a huge compliment.
[02:11.670 --> 02:13.710]  Thank you for mentioning that you've learned a lot from me.
[02:13.710 --> 02:14.990]  Thank you for saying that.
[02:14.990 --> 02:16.430]  That is all of the thanks I need.
[02:16.430 --> 02:19.950]  What I would really like is that you just go in the garden and kick ass, and it sounds
[02:19.950 --> 02:21.230]  like you're doing that.
[02:21.230 --> 02:25.970]  That is the best way to reward me or the Patreon campaign, of course, patreon.com forward slash
[02:25.970 --> 02:27.630]  grow from your heart.
[02:27.630 --> 02:31.350]  Messages like this, messages like this, and knowing that your garden is better is all
[02:31.350 --> 02:33.430]  the thanks and reward that I do need.
[02:33.430 --> 02:34.590]  But thank you for the compliments.
[02:34.590 --> 02:35.590]  Let's keep going.
[02:35.590 --> 02:39.050]  It says, my question is this.
[02:39.050 --> 02:43.070]  What sort of growth characteristics can you expect to see when you have the same plant?
[02:43.070 --> 02:47.790]  One has a taproot started from seed, and one is a plant started from a clone.
[02:47.790 --> 02:50.790]  Is it basically vigor and structure that will differ?
[02:50.790 --> 02:52.110]  Thank you for your time, buddy.
[02:52.110 --> 02:53.870]  Much love from Michigan.
[02:53.870 --> 02:55.830]  Big shout out to my buddy, Brent in Michigan.
[02:55.830 --> 02:57.110]  Thank you for the great question.
[02:57.110 --> 02:59.030]  I do have a good answer for this one.
[02:59.030 --> 03:02.510]  So they're asking, when we grow a plant, the first time we grow it, obviously the first
[03:02.510 --> 03:05.310]  time a plant is grown, every plant comes from a seed.
[03:05.310 --> 03:06.470]  It all starts from a seed.
[03:06.470 --> 03:09.070]  The first one is always from seed.
[03:09.070 --> 03:12.430]  Then from then, if we want to repeat that plant and grow that plant over again, it's
[03:12.430 --> 03:14.270]  got to be grown from a clone.
[03:14.270 --> 03:17.950]  We have to clone it, reproduce that plant, keep that clone alive, make more cuts, keep
[03:17.950 --> 03:19.350]  growing the same thing.
[03:19.350 --> 03:24.490]  The question is, will we see differences in growing that plant from a seed versus growing
[03:24.530 --> 03:27.250]  it from a clone, which is a great question.
[03:27.250 --> 03:30.530]  When we grow it from a seed, we do get what is called a taproot.
[03:30.530 --> 03:34.690]  That plant develops that original taproot, which is supposed to be that original source
[03:34.690 --> 03:38.710]  of life for that plant to dig into the dirt, dig into the roots, establish itself.
[03:38.710 --> 03:40.970]  It gets nice and thick, and it shoots straight down.
[03:40.970 --> 03:44.090]  Most of the time, the taproot tries to go down with the cannabis plant.
[03:44.090 --> 03:47.770]  It wants to go down, and then they start spreading out once they've gone down far enough.
[03:47.770 --> 03:53.570]  But that taproot is the main difference in the clone and the seed or origin plant.
[03:53.570 --> 03:54.930]  That is going to be the main difference.
[03:54.930 --> 03:57.970]  That does give us a little bit of more vigor.
[03:57.970 --> 04:01.170]  Sometimes you'll see if you plant a clone and plant a seed at the same time of the same
[04:01.170 --> 04:03.470]  plant, that seed will have a little bit more vigor.
[04:03.470 --> 04:04.590]  That is the hybrid vigor.
[04:04.590 --> 04:07.410]  That's that fresh life just trying to express itself.
[04:07.410 --> 04:11.770]  So the main difference you're going to see will indeed be that taproot is going to be
[04:11.770 --> 04:12.770]  your main difference.
[04:12.770 --> 04:17.790]  Other things you're going to see are possibly structure and pattern, and this does depend
[04:17.790 --> 04:19.270]  on a couple of things.
[04:19.270 --> 04:23.870]  You'll notice when you grow a cannabis plant, that main apical dominant top is symmetrical.
[04:23.870 --> 04:27.530]  It'll have branches coming off the left and the right, and then I think the easiest way
[04:27.530 --> 04:31.510]  to say it is northeast and then southwest, and then north and south and then east and
[04:31.510 --> 04:35.670]  west, and north and south and east and west is the way that the nodes will face.
[04:35.670 --> 04:38.790]  That's when you cut the clones from the apical meristem part of the plant.
[04:38.790 --> 04:42.430]  If you cut the clones from other branches of the plant, you may notice that those clones,
[04:42.430 --> 04:45.190]  that those branches may alternate where the nodes shoot out.
[04:45.190 --> 04:48.370]  It may just go north and south, north and south, north and south.
[04:48.370 --> 04:51.610]  It won't go north, south, east, west, north, south, or what am I doing?
[04:51.610 --> 04:52.610]  You know what I mean?
[04:52.610 --> 04:53.610]  It won't do all four.
[04:53.610 --> 04:54.610]  It won't do the plus sign.
[04:54.610 --> 04:59.050]  It'll just do a minus sign shooting nodes on opposite sides instead of all four directions.
[04:59.050 --> 05:01.490]  That is going to be one of the differences that you do see.
[05:01.490 --> 05:04.850]  Also, this is going to relate to another question that's coming up on the podcast that I've
[05:04.850 --> 05:06.330]  previewed.
[05:06.330 --> 05:11.050]  Sometimes that clone, sometimes the seeded plant will express some weird mutations, some
[05:11.050 --> 05:12.750]  weird funky growth.
[05:12.750 --> 05:17.850]  In some cases, I have seen the clone not do the weird shit that the seed plant originally
[05:17.850 --> 05:19.090]  did.
[05:19.090 --> 05:23.730]  That's hard to say if it was the plant doing something different or maybe it was environmental.
[05:23.730 --> 05:26.730]  Maybe I put the seedling into soil that was too rich.
[05:26.730 --> 05:27.930]  Maybe I gave it too much light.
[05:27.930 --> 05:31.650]  Maybe I overwatered it and something went weird there and that plant got ... Usually
[05:31.650 --> 05:35.810]  it's a mutation like a twisty leaf or just something, a weird structure, a weird shape,
[05:35.810 --> 05:38.090]  something like that, a weird reaction.
[05:38.090 --> 05:39.090]  Sometimes I don't see that.
[05:39.090 --> 05:42.570]  If I cut a clone and run the clone again, sometimes some of the plants don't show me
[05:42.570 --> 05:43.570]  that weird shit.
[05:43.570 --> 05:47.810]  I feel like it grows out or like I said, possibly it was something I did to it the first time.
[05:48.250 --> 05:52.210]  Sometimes we see differences in the entire performance of the plant when it comes from
[05:52.210 --> 05:53.210]  that clone.
[05:53.210 --> 05:55.690]  But that's just when I do run the anomalies, if the plant's good enough to get a clone
[05:55.690 --> 05:59.890]  from and I do decide to run it again, sometimes I have seen that those weirdos grow out of
[05:59.890 --> 06:02.530]  their weird shit in the second and third run.
[06:02.530 --> 06:05.450]  Let me see if there's more to this message, make sure I cover everything.
[06:05.450 --> 06:08.530]  Yes, the main difference is going to be that taproot.
[06:08.530 --> 06:10.330]  You'll see a difference in the vigor.
[06:10.330 --> 06:14.290]  Then we may see a difference in the structure and shape and the pattern of the plant.
[06:14.290 --> 06:16.410]  That all depends on where you cut it from.
[06:16.410 --> 06:19.790]  If you cut it from that apical meristem, you may get the all four direction nodes.
[06:19.790 --> 06:23.490]  If you cut it from a side branch, you're just going to get the two branches coming from
[06:23.490 --> 06:24.890]  the sides.
[06:24.890 --> 06:27.850]  The seed plant you'll notice is much more symmetrical.
[06:27.850 --> 06:30.290]  The seed plant wants to grow with symmetry.
[06:30.290 --> 06:35.330]  I do have some plants to make two tops just naturally on their own, but that's also symmetrical.
[06:35.330 --> 06:36.850]  You'll notice that from a seed plant.
[06:36.850 --> 06:39.770]  All right, my friend Brent, I do want to thank you for the great question.
[06:39.770 --> 06:43.770]  Since I read your question here on the air, that does mean that you win a free pack of
[06:43.770 --> 06:45.370]  iRi genetic seeds.
[06:45.370 --> 06:46.890]  Please send me a follow-up email.
[06:46.890 --> 06:48.130]  Send it also if you can.
[06:48.130 --> 06:51.010]  Send it on the same way that you submitted this question.
[06:51.010 --> 06:52.410]  Go to the Grow Help tab.
[06:52.410 --> 06:53.410]  Send me your address.
[06:53.410 --> 06:54.970]  Let me know where to ship you a pack of seeds.
[06:54.970 --> 06:57.690]  Please do include a real reasonable name.
[06:57.690 --> 06:58.850]  I don't want to ship packages.
[06:58.850 --> 06:59.850]  No offense to you guys.
[06:59.850 --> 07:01.090]  I love that you've got companies.
[07:01.090 --> 07:08.130]  I love that you're inspired, but I don't like sending packages to like GanjaPlantJoe and
[07:08.130 --> 07:11.130]  WeedheadBob420 and StonerDave5000.
[07:11.130 --> 07:14.750]  I love you guys and I love your cool names, but sometimes that looks a little suspicious
[07:14.830 --> 07:18.830]  and people at my post office may decide to look in your package or people at your post
[07:18.830 --> 07:20.950]  office may decide to look in your package.
[07:20.950 --> 07:22.350]  Let's just put our normal names on there.
[07:22.350 --> 07:23.350]  Let's just be cool.
[07:23.350 --> 07:24.350]  I'm not going to stalk you.
[07:24.350 --> 07:25.790]  I'm not going to do anything weird.
[07:25.790 --> 07:27.910]  Let me help you get your seeds to you.
[07:27.910 --> 07:28.910]  All right.
[07:28.910 --> 07:30.350]  Thank you once again for the great question.
[07:30.350 --> 07:34.830]  Let's keep this show moving because I do get sidetracked and get quite rambly.
[07:34.830 --> 07:38.550]  This next question came from the Grow Help tab on iRigenetics.com.
[07:38.550 --> 07:39.550]  That's right.
[07:39.550 --> 07:43.070]  That Grow Help tab is on iRigenetics.com and iRedirect.com.
[07:43.070 --> 07:45.230]  It's the same set of tabs at the top of the page.
[07:45.230 --> 07:46.230]  So just click on there.
[07:46.230 --> 07:48.470]  That will get you to the same Grow Help tab.
[07:48.470 --> 07:50.350]  This one came from our buddy Neilster.
[07:50.350 --> 07:51.770]  Big shout out to my dude Neilster.
[07:51.770 --> 07:53.270]  Thank you for the great question.
[07:53.270 --> 07:58.750]  Also Neilster, send me your address because I owe you a free pack of iRigenetics seeds.
[07:58.750 --> 08:03.310]  Once again, that seed giveaway is sponsored by my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[08:03.310 --> 08:05.550]  The question goes just like this.
[08:05.550 --> 08:07.710]  It says, Dear Ross to Jeff, big salute.
[08:07.710 --> 08:08.710]  Keep doing what you do.
[08:08.710 --> 08:10.590]  Bro, I'm going to keep doing it.
[08:10.590 --> 08:11.590]  Can't stop, won't stop.
[08:11.590 --> 08:12.590]  Made it this far.
[08:13.110 --> 08:14.110]  I'm not going to quit.
[08:14.110 --> 08:16.110]  Now, it says, I'm finally trying some iRig gear.
[08:16.110 --> 08:17.110]  Congratulations, bro.
[08:17.110 --> 08:18.110]  Welcome to the team.
[08:18.110 --> 08:21.710]  It says, I've got two gorilla goat sprouts and two lemon Jefferies.
[08:21.710 --> 08:22.710]  That's a great combination.
[08:22.710 --> 08:24.830]  They're going to work very well together.
[08:24.830 --> 08:28.310]  They're going to both grow quite tall, but they're both going to make very unique and
[08:28.310 --> 08:29.950]  different aromas.
[08:29.950 --> 08:34.110]  The gorilla glue is going to have more like a sweet, or the gorilla goat is going to have
[08:34.110 --> 08:36.430]  a more sweet gorilla glue flavor.
[08:36.430 --> 08:38.990]  And that lemon Jeffery is just straight pure lemons.
[08:38.990 --> 08:41.630]  So they're going to grow well together, but you're going to have a nice variety when the
[08:41.670 --> 08:42.670]  harvest comes.
[08:42.670 --> 08:43.990]  So that's a beautiful setup.
[08:43.990 --> 08:44.990]  It goes on.
[08:44.990 --> 08:46.990]  It says, I work in a commercial grow.
[08:46.990 --> 08:48.710]  Welcome to the team, bro.
[08:48.710 --> 08:52.070]  Then it says, we have two sets of 1212 rooms.
[08:52.070 --> 08:53.390]  Okay, that makes sense.
[08:53.390 --> 08:58.910]  We have a daytime room running 11 p.m. to a.m. and a nighttime room running 11 a.m.
[08:58.910 --> 08:59.910]  to 11 p.m.
[08:59.910 --> 09:00.910]  Is that right?
[09:00.910 --> 09:01.910]  Day and nighttime.
[09:01.910 --> 09:05.470]  Anyway, we've got 1111 and 1111 is their schedules.
[09:05.470 --> 09:09.230]  So they can divide the day into half and have two 1212 rooms.
[09:09.230 --> 09:11.110]  It says, why would we do this?
[09:11.110 --> 09:15.910]  Is there any reason other than night shift and possibly saving on electricity?
[09:15.910 --> 09:19.510]  I can't understand why they don't put all of the lights on during the day on.
[09:19.510 --> 09:22.590]  You can only get into each room for half of the day as it stands.
[09:22.590 --> 09:24.350]  So help me figure this out.
[09:24.350 --> 09:29.050]  So the situation is our dude has a commercial grow space, works at a commercial grow space,
[09:29.050 --> 09:34.110]  and it's cut in half and they run one half of the flowering room on 1212 from 11 a.m.
[09:34.110 --> 09:35.110]  to 11 p.m.
[09:35.110 --> 09:38.350]  And when that turns off, then they allocate that electricity to the other side of the
[09:38.350 --> 09:41.910]  room so that it can be on from 11 p.m. to 11 a.m.
[09:41.910 --> 09:47.030]  I could understand seriously how this would be frustrating trying to schedule a workflow.
[09:47.030 --> 09:49.150]  Employees don't want to be anywhere at 11 p.m.
[09:49.150 --> 09:51.350]  They should be at home in bed sleeping.
[09:51.350 --> 09:55.030]  And then for the transition to happen at 11, that means that you've got to come in at like
[09:55.030 --> 09:59.710]  8 o'clock and get you get three hours in that one room and then the lights go off and shift
[09:59.710 --> 10:02.830]  into the other room and then you get whatever they're on all day.
[10:02.830 --> 10:04.830]  But you only have so many hours left to work.
[10:04.830 --> 10:07.950]  So it's probably hard to pain in the ass to schedule working in there.
[10:07.950 --> 10:11.670]  You probably got to come in at six or seven in the morning to get shit done in the 11
[10:11.670 --> 10:12.670]  the nighttime room.
[10:12.670 --> 10:14.630]  So I understand why that's frustrating.
[10:14.630 --> 10:18.810]  This question is all about why do I think they are doing this?
[10:18.810 --> 10:23.130]  My main assumption for why they are doing this is to save on electricity.
[10:23.130 --> 10:28.710]  They probably possibly likely I'm assuming do not have enough electrical power to run
[10:28.710 --> 10:32.390]  the entire side, the entire room all at one time.
[10:32.390 --> 10:36.390]  It's probably less load on the the transformers, whatever is bringing in the electricity.
[10:36.390 --> 10:38.390]  I don't know what where you're sourcing your power.
[10:38.390 --> 10:41.950]  If you've got three phase power, I hope you do in a big commercial facility, but maybe
[10:41.950 --> 10:43.150]  not.
[10:43.150 --> 10:44.910]  So maybe it's a power limitation.
[10:44.910 --> 10:47.670]  Maybe they can't run it all because of the electricity.
[10:47.670 --> 10:51.150]  Maybe they don't have enough air conditioning to cool that many lights all at one time.
[10:51.150 --> 10:54.470]  And it's easier just to cool it down only running half of it.
[10:54.470 --> 10:56.510]  Also you did state one thing.
[10:56.510 --> 11:01.150]  Kilowatt hours are much cheaper during off peak hours, which means they charge more for
[11:01.150 --> 11:03.150]  electricity during the day.
[11:03.150 --> 11:07.390]  The time when everybody's at work, when we're all up watching TV, running our coffee makers,
[11:07.390 --> 11:10.710]  running the TV, running the grow lights on our own houses.
[11:10.710 --> 11:13.230]  But at the office, they got all the lights on at the stores.
[11:13.230 --> 11:14.670]  They've got all the lights on.
[11:14.670 --> 11:18.030]  All the lights are on everywhere you go because all the businesses are open.
[11:18.030 --> 11:20.550]  That means that electricity is more on demand, which means guess what?
[11:20.550 --> 11:22.030]  They charge more for it.
[11:22.030 --> 11:25.790]  When everybody goes home and everyone's just chilling late at night, electricity gets cheaper
[11:25.790 --> 11:27.230]  because we don't need as much of it.
[11:27.230 --> 11:31.070]  So it's more cost effective for a grower to run the lights at night.
[11:31.630 --> 11:33.710]  It's kind of a pain in the ass for a commercial grow.
[11:33.710 --> 11:37.230]  So I wouldn't recommend that for a commercial facility unless you've got a dedicated night
[11:37.230 --> 11:39.750]  shift, which this facility does not have.
[11:39.750 --> 11:42.750]  So the first assumption is power limitations.
[11:42.750 --> 11:47.390]  The second question, the second assumption would probably be air conditioning limitations.
[11:47.390 --> 11:52.790]  Other than that, I am not sure why that would be an effective idea, why that would be a
[11:52.790 --> 11:54.190]  good strategy.
[11:54.190 --> 11:59.030]  I think my next move would be to ask management, ask ownership, hey, why do we do this?
[11:59.030 --> 12:00.830]  Is there a night shift that will be happening?
[12:00.870 --> 12:02.350]  Are we going to change this?
[12:02.350 --> 12:06.670]  Just ask very politely, can we run both of these rooms all at one time?
[12:06.670 --> 12:10.270]  Because what's going to happen, in my opinion, I'm not there, I don't know how hard you guys
[12:10.270 --> 12:13.470]  work, I don't know what you're capable of, but this makes me think that you're going
[12:13.470 --> 12:18.190]  to have one room that's always growing like top shelf weed and another room that's just
[12:18.190 --> 12:22.430]  not as good as the other all the time because you're only able to spend so many hours.
[12:22.430 --> 12:27.590]  That night shift room, whichever one goes off at 11 a.m., if you come in at 6, you only
[12:27.590 --> 12:29.030]  get five hours to work in there.
[12:29.030 --> 12:32.110]  If you come in at, you're not going to get enough time to work in that room.
[12:32.110 --> 12:34.790]  Or the other ones, if you've got an eight or 10 hour shift, you're going to have to
[12:34.790 --> 12:36.790]  divide up five hours in each room.
[12:36.790 --> 12:39.310]  It's not going to be, you're not going to get the quality that you could if you just
[12:39.310 --> 12:40.310]  ran it all at once.
[12:40.310 --> 12:43.390]  So my first question would be, do we have the power capabilities?
[12:43.390 --> 12:45.310]  Can we run all of this at one time?
[12:45.310 --> 12:48.790]  The next question would be, do we have the air conditioning capabilities?
[12:48.790 --> 12:52.710]  And then the next question is, do they think they've got the staffing trained and available
[12:52.710 --> 12:53.710]  to do that?
[12:53.710 --> 12:57.430]  If you build an auto watering system and you don't have to water every plant by hand, if
[12:57.430 --> 13:01.390]  you can just focus on, cut the clones on time, get the clones transplanted into the
[13:01.390 --> 13:06.590]  next pots, get the small plants transplanted into large pots, have the large pots prepared
[13:06.590 --> 13:08.950]  in 30 days to go into the flower room.
[13:08.950 --> 13:11.610]  Then once they go into the flower room, you go back into the other room and you cut more
[13:11.610 --> 13:14.030]  clones and push everything up into that space.
[13:14.030 --> 13:17.790]  If you can accomplish that rhythm, it shouldn't take a lot of people to accomplish that rhythm
[13:17.790 --> 13:20.870]  in up to 85 to 115-ish lights.
[13:20.870 --> 13:22.190]  That could take one or two people.
[13:22.190 --> 13:26.830]  I've ran a hundred light facility, it was a hundred flowering lights plus a bedroom
[13:26.830 --> 13:32.350]  plus a mom area with myself as the lead cultivator and two backup guys, one guy to help me out
[13:32.350 --> 13:33.350]  every day of the week.
[13:33.350 --> 13:36.790]  And then on the weekends, I would take the weekends off and those two guys would run
[13:36.790 --> 13:39.310]  the ship on the weekends plus a trim team.
[13:39.310 --> 13:42.910]  Sometimes we did have a full on trim team because that's a lot of work, but the cultivation,
[13:42.910 --> 13:47.270]  a hundred lights is one person with one or two backup people helping.
[13:47.270 --> 13:48.270]  That's my opinion.
[13:48.270 --> 13:49.270]  That's my experience.
[13:49.270 --> 13:50.350]  That's what I could train for.
[13:50.350 --> 13:54.470]  So I'd see if the staff has confidence or if the management has confidence in the staff.
[13:54.470 --> 13:55.910]  If not, let's automate some shit.
[13:55.910 --> 13:57.950]  Let's get some auto watering going on there.
[13:57.950 --> 13:59.510]  Let's learn how to trellis more effectively.
[13:59.510 --> 14:01.070]  We'll turn out a pop and twist.
[14:01.070 --> 14:02.070]  Let's learn how to defoliate.
[14:02.070 --> 14:06.910]  Let's learn how to manage the room, the gear, the equipment and the plants to save ourselves
[14:06.910 --> 14:07.910]  time.
[14:07.910 --> 14:08.910]  There's so much automation.
[14:08.910 --> 14:10.830]  AI is going to take over very soon.
[14:10.830 --> 14:14.470]  Let's learn how to do a lot of that shit before AI pushes us out of a job.
[14:14.470 --> 14:15.630]  All right.
[14:15.630 --> 14:17.350]  My dude, Neil Sturr.
[14:17.350 --> 14:18.350]  Thank you for the great question.
[14:18.350 --> 14:19.990]  I hope I answered that one.
[14:20.630 --> 14:24.990]  Once again, my assumptions are power limitations, but I really do not know why.
[14:24.990 --> 14:27.110]  I used to have a room like this back in the day.
[14:27.110 --> 14:28.590]  Let me get rambling here for a minute.
[14:28.590 --> 14:30.590]  I used to have an office.
[14:30.590 --> 14:33.430]  It was like an 11 by 14 office space.
[14:33.430 --> 14:38.350]  In that room, I put two five by five grow tents, but I wasn't able to increase the power
[14:38.350 --> 14:39.350]  in that room.
[14:39.350 --> 14:43.710]  I could not run 2000 watts of light at one time, but I could run 1000 all the time with
[14:43.710 --> 14:44.950]  no problem.
[14:44.950 --> 14:49.750]  So I bought a device called a flip box and I plugged one ballast into the flip box and
[14:50.510 --> 14:53.590]  plugged into a timer, then went into the wall.
[14:53.590 --> 14:57.310]  It sounds more complicated than it is, but what would happen is one ballast would run
[14:57.310 --> 15:01.390]  to basically a Y cable that would go for 12 hours.
[15:01.390 --> 15:05.950]  It would go to tent B and then for the opposite 12 hours, it would go to tent A and there
[15:05.950 --> 15:09.590]  was just a little box that attached to my ballast that would just redirect the power
[15:09.590 --> 15:10.590]  to which bulb.
[15:10.590 --> 15:11.590]  So I was able to run.
[15:11.590 --> 15:13.230]  I constantly had that room flowering.
[15:13.230 --> 15:16.910]  I had two five by fives flowering in that room and I didn't ever have to overload the
[15:16.910 --> 15:17.910]  power.
[15:17.910 --> 15:21.150]  So I don't know if it feels like what they're doing here on a larger scale, but it's kind
[15:21.150 --> 15:23.710]  of a pain in the ass if you're not able to get into the rooms.
[15:23.710 --> 15:25.230]  I would ask them about it.
[15:25.230 --> 15:26.230]  Don't be shy.
[15:26.230 --> 15:27.230]  Ask questions.
[15:27.230 --> 15:28.470]  See if we can make shit better.
[15:28.470 --> 15:31.150]  Let them know you're only asking questions because you feel like you could improve your
[15:31.150 --> 15:34.670]  performance if the rooms were on more even schedules.
[15:34.670 --> 15:36.990]  All right, my dude, thank you for the great question.
[15:36.990 --> 15:40.610]  Please don't forget to send me your address with a real quality name so I can ship you
[15:40.610 --> 15:43.350]  a free pack of IRIE genetics seeds.
[15:43.350 --> 15:46.510]  All right, podcast world, let's keep this party moving.
[15:46.510 --> 15:49.670]  This next question came from my friend, Alabama man.
[15:49.670 --> 15:51.430]  Big shout out to my dude, Alabama man.
[15:51.430 --> 15:53.110]  Thank you for the continued Patreon support.
[15:53.110 --> 15:54.690]  I do appreciate that.
[15:54.690 --> 15:56.830]  The question goes a little bit like this.
[15:56.830 --> 15:58.130]  First of all, it says, what kind of problem?
[15:58.130 --> 15:59.190]  What kind of question do you have?
[15:59.190 --> 16:00.830]  It's a problem in my garden.
[16:00.830 --> 16:01.830]  What strain are you growing?
[16:01.830 --> 16:06.030]  There are seven year old beans from Nirvana seed bank, which is pretty cool.
[16:06.030 --> 16:07.830]  Were you growing them indoors under LEDs?
[16:07.830 --> 16:08.830]  We're in veg.
[16:08.830 --> 16:11.150]  We're in week three of veg.
[16:11.150 --> 16:12.150]  We're growing in cocoa.
[16:12.150 --> 16:15.750]  Then the question goes a lot like this and says, hey brother, what's up bro?
[16:15.750 --> 16:16.750]  Good to see you.
[16:16.750 --> 16:21.230]  It says, I was so proud to have germinated seven year old seeds a while back.
[16:21.230 --> 16:23.310]  Yeah, sometimes old seeds are a real bitch to pop.
[16:23.310 --> 16:26.190]  So I'm proud of you for having gotten those going.
[16:26.190 --> 16:31.550]  It says they popped within 48 hours and responded well to normal feedings and lighting and always
[16:31.550 --> 16:35.830]  looked happy but remained a little bit miniature in forum.
[16:35.830 --> 16:37.110]  That could just been genetics.
[16:37.110 --> 16:38.110]  That could have been that they were tired.
[16:38.110 --> 16:39.350]  It could have been that they were old.
[16:39.350 --> 16:41.550]  It could have just been the kind of plants that they were.
[16:41.550 --> 16:43.110]  It does go on.
[16:43.110 --> 16:47.110]  I topped the plants at week three and it demanded more newts like normal but never sparked an
[16:47.110 --> 16:49.670]  outward or upward growth spurt.
[16:49.670 --> 16:51.170]  After week three, I yanked it.
[16:51.170 --> 16:53.230]  It had a beautiful root system too.
[16:53.230 --> 16:58.070]  I take meticulous care of my seed bank, but everything like, like everything time took
[16:58.070 --> 16:59.470]  its toll, I suppose.
[16:59.470 --> 17:00.470]  All right.
[17:00.470 --> 17:01.470]  That's a good assumption.
[17:01.470 --> 17:02.470]  There is more to this.
[17:02.470 --> 17:05.870]  It says, what is the oldest seed you have ever popped?
[17:05.870 --> 17:08.290]  I don't think the seeds I've popped have ever been super old.
[17:08.290 --> 17:10.830]  If I'm going to pop something, it's probably something I recently bought.
[17:10.830 --> 17:14.430]  I'm kind of eager to grow shit when I buy it.
[17:14.430 --> 17:16.670]  I don't store seeds for a real long time.
[17:16.670 --> 17:20.070]  I'd like to say no more than three or five, maybe seven or eight years old.
[17:20.070 --> 17:23.510]  Did try to run some old stuff a while back and like you, only some of it popped up and
[17:23.510 --> 17:25.990]  a couple of the things that did pop up didn't look good.
[17:25.990 --> 17:29.310]  What came out of it was really good stuff, but some of it just did not look healthy.
[17:29.310 --> 17:31.550]  I understand what happened to you.
[17:31.550 --> 17:35.590]  Most of the time, I buy my seeds and I either grow them right away or if I've still got
[17:35.590 --> 17:38.230]  them, it's because I've had them for years and years and I'm not going to grow them and
[17:38.230 --> 17:40.470]  I should probably give them to one of my friends to grow.
[17:40.870 --> 17:42.910]  We'll dig into the vault one day and share some of that stuff.
[17:42.910 --> 17:45.790]  It says, should I trash all of my seven-year-old beans?
[17:45.790 --> 17:47.030]  No, no.
[17:47.030 --> 17:49.950]  If you're going to trash them, at least try to grow them before you trash them.
[17:49.950 --> 17:51.790]  What could go wrong?
[17:51.790 --> 17:55.670]  Skip straight to the trash can and just put them into a paper towel or however you germinate.
[17:55.670 --> 17:56.670]  Try that first.
[17:56.670 --> 18:00.030]  Then if they don't work, then put them in the trash, but at least give them a try.
[18:00.030 --> 18:03.670]  You may have some fucking magic in those old seeds.
[18:03.670 --> 18:05.550]  So they could be shitty even if they were new.
[18:05.550 --> 18:06.950]  That's something to think about.
[18:06.950 --> 18:10.270]  Those seeds, even when they were new, they might have been subpar seeds.
[18:10.270 --> 18:11.990]  Not every seed is an amazing plant.
[18:11.990 --> 18:14.590]  Not every seed is going to be top shelf grow.
[18:14.590 --> 18:18.590]  So even if those were new, even if they were old, they could have been terrible.
[18:18.590 --> 18:19.590]  They could have been awesome.
[18:19.590 --> 18:21.510]  We can't attribute all of it to age.
[18:21.510 --> 18:22.670]  We're going to blame it on age.
[18:22.670 --> 18:23.670]  We're going to attribute that.
[18:23.670 --> 18:27.750]  We're going to say that you did everything you could and they were just bad old seeds.
[18:27.750 --> 18:30.470]  But no, don't toss all your old seeds.
[18:30.470 --> 18:31.470]  Try to grow them, dude.
[18:31.470 --> 18:32.470]  See what they do.
[18:32.470 --> 18:36.050]  Instead of if you're looking to grow two or three plants, germinate 10 of those bad motherfuckers
[18:36.150 --> 18:37.150]  and see what comes up.
[18:37.150 --> 18:38.430]  Power in numbers.
[18:38.430 --> 18:42.250]  You might get something super, super cool out of their old weed was really great.
[18:42.250 --> 18:44.090]  Some of the older weed was really awesome.
[18:44.090 --> 18:46.370]  So whatever you had back in the day might be amazing.
[18:46.370 --> 18:47.710]  So keep trying.
[18:47.710 --> 18:49.570]  Those seeds could be even new seeds.
[18:49.570 --> 18:50.570]  Sometimes they're shitty.
[18:50.570 --> 18:53.970]  Sometimes I make a cross and the seeds will sprout and I can tell right away like, oh,
[18:53.970 --> 18:55.890]  we're not going to be able to release that one.
[18:55.890 --> 18:57.470]  That's just you can see it sometimes.
[18:57.470 --> 18:58.530]  So who knows what you had?
[18:58.530 --> 18:59.530]  Who knows what they were?
[18:59.530 --> 19:04.250]  Now it says, what a clone from the same plant I pulled exhibit the same growth habits as
[19:04.250 --> 19:06.410]  its stunted mother.
[19:06.410 --> 19:14.010]  It should technically genetically scientifically it should comma.
[19:14.010 --> 19:18.750]  But sometimes, like I said earlier, some of those freaky ass plants, the first time you
[19:18.750 --> 19:23.130]  grow it, if you cut a clone and grow that clone out, it will do different shit.
[19:23.130 --> 19:25.890]  I've got a plant that I put in a different room recently.
[19:25.890 --> 19:27.530]  It's never been in this environment before.
[19:27.530 --> 19:30.690]  And I'm seeing different shit from a plant that I've ever seen before.
[19:30.690 --> 19:32.770]  A lot of times it could be about the environment.
[19:32.770 --> 19:37.650]  A weird shit you saw could be like I said earlier, it could be hot soil over moisture,
[19:37.650 --> 19:39.830]  too much humidity, too dry.
[19:39.830 --> 19:43.330]  Sometimes those ceilings will tell you right away like there's a fucking problem in here,
[19:43.330 --> 19:45.730]  but then it'll grow out of it and you'll cut that clone.
[19:45.730 --> 19:48.690]  And the clone is the same age as that original plant.
[19:48.690 --> 19:52.710]  So if you've had that original plant for eight weeks and then you cut the clone, that clone
[19:52.710 --> 19:54.250]  is technically eight weeks old.
[19:54.250 --> 19:55.510]  It's still continuing.
[19:55.510 --> 19:57.450]  It's still got part of that age to it.
[19:57.450 --> 19:59.050]  It's just grown out of that wonky shit.
[19:59.050 --> 20:01.070]  So maybe it won't go back to it.
[20:01.070 --> 20:02.170]  Sometimes it does.
[20:02.170 --> 20:03.170]  Sometimes it grows out of it.
[20:03.170 --> 20:08.930]  So I don't have a solid, definite, infinite answer for that because the answer is it should.
[20:08.930 --> 20:11.930]  But sometimes, just because that's how genetics and nature work.
[20:11.930 --> 20:14.210]  I can't make any promises when it comes to that one.
[20:14.210 --> 20:17.430]  All right, my dude Alabama, man, I hope I answered your question.
[20:17.430 --> 20:19.010]  Don't be discouraged with your old seeds.
[20:19.010 --> 20:20.690]  Don't throw your seed collection away.
[20:20.690 --> 20:22.170]  They still look good in the vault.
[20:22.170 --> 20:23.890]  They still count as a good collection.
[20:23.890 --> 20:26.790]  And when you do try to grow them, maybe they'll work and maybe they won't.
[20:26.790 --> 20:29.850]  If you put them straight in the trash, you'll never know if they were any good or not.
[20:29.850 --> 20:31.010]  So keep trying.
[20:31.050 --> 20:35.290]  So before we wrap this up, I'm going to recommend a product called Herb.
[20:35.290 --> 20:37.090]  It is spelled U-R-B.
[20:37.090 --> 20:42.050]  It's a little bit expensive, but it does work very well at helping get old seeds going.
[20:42.050 --> 20:45.370]  Also if you want to be creative and you want to do a little bit of research on your own,
[20:45.370 --> 20:46.810]  I'm going to leave this up to you.
[20:46.810 --> 20:51.850]  A little bit of gibberellic acid, a little GA3 will definitely help get those seeds going.
[20:51.850 --> 20:54.170]  But you've got some work to do to check on that yourself.
[20:54.170 --> 20:55.570]  There are safety precautions to take.
[20:55.570 --> 20:58.290]  There are a lot of risks involved when using the GA3.
[20:58.290 --> 21:01.890]  So be very careful if you choose to go that route.
[21:01.890 --> 21:06.970]  Once again, as a disclaimer, as a safety measure, as a legal disclaimer, be fucking careful.
[21:06.970 --> 21:07.970]  All right.
[21:07.970 --> 21:09.770]  I think that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[21:09.770 --> 21:13.370]  My dude, Alabama Man, please send me your address so I can get you a free pack of Irie
