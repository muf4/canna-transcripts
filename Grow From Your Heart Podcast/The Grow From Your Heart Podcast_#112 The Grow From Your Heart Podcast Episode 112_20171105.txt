[00:17.600 --> 00:20.200]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.760]  It's time for episode number 112
[00:21.760 --> 00:23.360]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:23.360 --> 00:27.520]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.520 --> 00:28.680]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.680 --> 00:30.040]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.040 --> 00:32.180]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.180 --> 00:33.560]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.560 --> 00:34.720]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.720 --> 00:36.240]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.240 --> 00:38.520]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.280]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.280 --> 00:43.080]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.080 --> 00:45.200]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.200 --> 00:46.700]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:46.700 --> 00:48.620]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:48.620 --> 00:51.960]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.860 --> 00:53.740]  Right now, you guys are listening
[00:53.740 --> 00:55.100]  to a song called The Doggy Dub.
[00:55.100 --> 00:56.620]  It's off the album The Constant Struggle.
[00:56.620 --> 00:58.020]  Make sure you check that out.
[00:58.940 --> 01:00.420]  Also, this podcast is brought to you
[01:00.420 --> 01:02.380]  by our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[01:02.380 --> 01:05.100]  Hitman Glass, glass made in America by American.
[01:05.940 --> 01:07.060]  When I'm shopping for a new rig,
[01:07.060 --> 01:08.580]  I like to know that what I'm paying for
[01:08.580 --> 01:10.140]  is gonna give me a nice fat dab,
[01:10.140 --> 01:12.180]  and I can always rely on Hitman Glass.
[01:12.180 --> 01:13.780]  You guys, don't trust your dab,
[01:13.780 --> 01:15.660]  don't trust your dab to a rig made in China
[01:15.700 --> 01:17.780]  by a Chinese child without proper eye protection
[01:17.780 --> 01:20.140]  or adequate pay, probably barefoot,
[01:20.140 --> 01:21.900]  working all day with no wages.
[01:21.900 --> 01:23.580]  You guys, buy Hitman Glass, made in America
[01:23.580 --> 01:26.020]  by folks who dab as hard as you and I.
[01:26.020 --> 01:28.340]  Hitman Glass is not only a glass company.
[01:28.340 --> 01:29.580]  Hitman Dougie is a huge part
[01:29.580 --> 01:31.060]  of the cannabis and hash movement.
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.580]  Make sure you support Hitman Glass,
[01:32.580 --> 01:33.420]  and be sure to check out
[01:33.420 --> 01:35.260]  the Chalice Festival in California.
[01:35.260 --> 01:38.060]  Go to hitmanglass.com,
[01:38.060 --> 01:40.900]  and also search for Hitman Glass Dougie on Instagram,
[01:40.900 --> 01:42.060]  and give them a follow.
[01:42.980 --> 01:44.280]  Sorry, guys, I'm coughing through the intro
[01:44.280 --> 01:45.120]  because I'm already sitting here
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.240]  hitting my Hitman E-Series sidecar.
[01:47.240 --> 01:48.480]  This is my first Hitman rig,
[01:48.480 --> 01:49.680]  and I've been impressed
[01:49.680 --> 01:51.640]  since my first rip out of this bad dog.
[01:51.640 --> 01:53.520]  I picked this up at Illusion's Glass Gallery
[01:53.520 --> 01:55.220]  about five years ago.
[01:55.220 --> 01:57.180]  This has been my go-to rig all the time.
[01:57.180 --> 01:58.220]  It's sitting right here in front of me.
[01:58.220 --> 02:00.040]  Right now, I've got the, let's see,
[02:00.040 --> 02:02.160]  it's got the white Hitman logo on the side.
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.240]  It's got the black flame logo up the stem piece
[02:05.240 --> 02:06.760]  where the nail goes,
[02:06.760 --> 02:08.800]  and it's got a big fat base on it.
[02:08.800 --> 02:10.060]  It's got the E-Series perk,
[02:10.060 --> 02:13.080]  so the perk has the letter E in it four times,
[02:13.080 --> 02:14.760]  and it's got a Hitman,
[02:14.760 --> 02:17.440]  highly educated, dualitye nail on it.
[02:17.440 --> 02:18.520]  That is my go-to rig.
[02:18.520 --> 02:21.380]  That's probably my favorite rig in the whole collection.
[02:21.380 --> 02:22.640]  Until the new rig arrives,
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.280]  we will talk about that one when it gets here.
[02:24.280 --> 02:25.540]  So big shout out to Hitman Glass, you guys.
[02:25.540 --> 02:26.920]  Make sure you support Hitman Glass.
[02:26.920 --> 02:28.320]  If you're looking for a new rig,
[02:28.320 --> 02:31.560]  go to hitmanglass.com and check it out.
[02:31.560 --> 02:32.760]  Let them know that Ross and Jeff
[02:32.760 --> 02:34.440]  from the Grow From Your Heart podcast sent you.
[02:34.440 --> 02:37.040]  Mystic Roots, that was good timing.
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.800]  Big shout out to the Mystic Roots crew.
[02:38.800 --> 02:40.720]  You guys, I am recording on Christmas Eve.
[02:40.720 --> 02:42.720]  By the time this comes out, Christmas will have happened.
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.640]  I hope you guys all had a wonderful Christmas.
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.500]  I hope you got the gifts you wanted.
[02:46.500 --> 02:48.580]  I hope you gave a bunch of wonderful gifts.
[02:48.580 --> 02:50.060]  I hope you got to see people smile
[02:50.060 --> 02:52.320]  at the gifts that you gave them.
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.680]  This is also the last episode for the year 2015,
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.920]  so when I come back, it will be the year 2016.
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.080]  I am going to put together a checklist
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.880]  of things that you guys should be doing
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.080]  like monthly, daily, weekly, monthly.
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.460]  We'll put together a checklist of things
[03:08.460 --> 03:10.280]  that you guys should be handling in your gardens,
[03:10.320 --> 03:12.780]  and I'll get that out to you at the beginning of the year
[03:12.780 --> 03:15.040]  so that you can start getting on top of that.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.360]  I'm sure you're already on top of your garden,
[03:16.360 --> 03:18.840]  but I'm sure also there's some shit that you are missing.
[03:18.840 --> 03:20.340]  Sometimes we need a reminder.
[03:20.340 --> 03:22.760]  I make myself a bunch of ridiculous little notes,
[03:22.760 --> 03:24.800]  try to remind myself of things that need to get done,
[03:24.800 --> 03:26.920]  and I'm gonna try to make a list for you guys.
[03:26.920 --> 03:28.000]  All right, I'm rambly.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.280]  I'm gonna turn down this music a little bit,
[03:29.280 --> 03:32.280]  and we will get into the show.
[03:32.280 --> 03:33.120]  Dun, dun, dun.
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.320]  Merry Christmas, everybody.
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.880]  I'm stoked for Christmas.
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.720]  I'm feeling the vibe.
[03:36.720 --> 03:37.840]  I wasn't feeling the Christmas vibe.
[03:37.840 --> 03:38.660]  I've been working too much.
[03:38.660 --> 03:39.500]  I've been busy.
[03:39.940 --> 03:40.780]  I've been on the go,
[03:40.780 --> 03:41.620]  but I finally got all my Christmas shopping done.
[03:41.620 --> 03:43.140]  I got caught up, so I'm feeling the vibe.
[03:43.140 --> 03:45.260]  I'm in a good mood, having a good day.
[03:45.260 --> 03:47.220]  Been sitting here taking dabs, getting the show prepared,
[03:47.220 --> 03:48.620]  so let's get into it.
[03:48.620 --> 03:51.440]  I know you guys would prefer grow lessons,
[03:51.440 --> 03:53.060]  but it's been a busy couple of weeks,
[03:53.060 --> 03:54.520]  and then I saw this news article,
[03:54.520 --> 03:57.660]  so there's gonna be a little bit of news on this episode,
[03:57.660 --> 04:00.360]  and then I am going to talk about
[04:00.360 --> 04:02.940]  how I got into the cannabis industry.
[04:02.940 --> 04:04.580]  I was hanging out with a few friends
[04:04.580 --> 04:05.740]  that have known me for quite a while,
[04:05.740 --> 04:07.420]  and they're like, dude, how did you even get into this?
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.540]  And I was like, well, that's a podcast topic,
[04:09.540 --> 04:10.980]  so let me just say it into a microphone,
[04:10.980 --> 04:12.440]  and then you guys can listen to the show.
[04:12.440 --> 04:14.580]  So I'll talk about that in a couple of minutes.
[04:14.580 --> 04:15.840]  Before I get to the news article,
[04:15.840 --> 04:18.860]  before I get to talking about how I got into the industry,
[04:18.860 --> 04:20.980]  I wanna give a little bit of advice.
[04:20.980 --> 04:23.500]  A friend asked me about foliar spray.
[04:23.500 --> 04:26.740]  He's actually applying silver thiosulfate to his plants
[04:26.740 --> 04:29.860]  so that he can reverse his females into males
[04:29.860 --> 04:31.680]  and make feminized seeds,
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.660]  and he asked me one question about foliar spray
[04:34.700 --> 04:38.020]  that I thought I should help you guys out with a little bit.
[04:38.020 --> 04:39.300]  When you are spraying your plants,
[04:39.300 --> 04:42.140]  whether it be foliar spray, whether it be pesticides,
[04:42.140 --> 04:43.980]  whether it be silver thiosulfate
[04:43.980 --> 04:46.980]  to try to make male plants out of them,
[04:46.980 --> 04:48.040]  however you are spraying them,
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.780]  I highly suggest that you either spray
[04:50.780 --> 04:52.060]  right when the lights go off
[04:52.060 --> 04:55.180]  or that you turn the lights off while you spray.
[04:55.180 --> 04:56.360]  There are a couple of reasons for this,
[04:56.360 --> 04:58.340]  but my main reason for this
[04:58.340 --> 05:00.180]  is that you don't wanna spray your plants
[05:00.180 --> 05:03.180]  when you've got big, heavy, high-intensity discharge lights
[05:03.180 --> 05:04.260]  right above them,
[05:04.260 --> 05:05.720]  because you're gonna spray little bubbles
[05:05.720 --> 05:06.560]  all over your plants.
[05:06.560 --> 05:08.200]  You're gonna put this layer of bubbles,
[05:08.200 --> 05:10.140]  that's basically a bunch of bubbles, all over your plants.
[05:10.140 --> 05:12.420]  If you want a nice, fine mist when you spray,
[05:12.420 --> 05:13.940]  so you're gonna have bubbles all over your plants,
[05:13.940 --> 05:15.220]  plants are gonna be soaked,
[05:15.220 --> 05:16.940]  and these high-intensity discharge lights
[05:16.940 --> 05:18.760]  are gonna shine down onto those bubbles,
[05:18.760 --> 05:21.440]  and it's going to work kinda like a magnifying glass.
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.420]  Remember when you were a little kid
[05:22.420 --> 05:25.060]  and you used to roast ants with a magnifying glass?
[05:25.060 --> 05:26.460]  I know, not everybody did that,
[05:26.460 --> 05:27.820]  but a lot of the boys are nodding their head going,
[05:27.820 --> 05:29.020]  yeah, we did that.
[05:29.020 --> 05:31.020]  Well, you're gonna do the same thing to your plants.
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.460]  The lights are gonna act like the sun,
[05:33.460 --> 05:35.500]  the bubble is gonna act like the magnifying glass,
[05:35.500 --> 05:37.940]  and your leaf is gonna get little white burn dots on it,
[05:37.940 --> 05:39.720]  and you're gonna be really confused as to what it's from.
[05:39.720 --> 05:40.760]  You're gonna think a bug ate it,
[05:40.760 --> 05:42.580]  you're gonna think you have a deficiency,
[05:42.580 --> 05:43.660]  you're gonna think something's messed up,
[05:43.660 --> 05:45.980]  but honestly, what happened was you foliar sprayed
[05:45.980 --> 05:47.660]  and the light made a little bubble on there
[05:47.660 --> 05:49.140]  and it burned the shit out of your plants.
[05:49.140 --> 05:51.780]  So I highly recommend either removing the plants
[05:51.780 --> 05:53.720]  from the light, turning off the light,
[05:53.720 --> 05:55.300]  or waiting until the light clicks off.
[05:55.300 --> 05:56.360]  Right when that light clicks off,
[05:56.360 --> 05:57.820]  if you've got a small crop,
[05:57.820 --> 05:59.380]  you should be able to get in there
[05:59.380 --> 06:00.900]  and you should be able to spray that entire crop
[06:01.780 --> 06:02.620]  in just a couple of minutes,
[06:02.620 --> 06:03.860]  and your plants won't even notice that you kept them up
[06:03.860 --> 06:04.900]  for a couple of extra minutes.
[06:04.900 --> 06:06.300]  And that way you're not gonna get any burns
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.180]  on your plants from the light,
[06:08.180 --> 06:10.140]  and then you're not interrupting your photo period
[06:10.140 --> 06:11.780]  and your plants are gonna get all of the light
[06:11.780 --> 06:13.740]  that they should have gotten throughout the day cycle.
[06:13.740 --> 06:16.060]  So I recommend spraying right as the lights go off,
[06:16.060 --> 06:17.580]  or if you need to turn the lights off,
[06:17.580 --> 06:20.300]  or if you must just remove the plants.
[06:20.300 --> 06:21.660]  If you're only gonna spray one or two plants,
[06:21.660 --> 06:25.580]  like my friend Fred is trying to reverse a female plant
[06:25.580 --> 06:28.380]  into a male by spraying it with silver thiosulfate,
[06:28.380 --> 06:31.140]  then I would just take that plant into another room.
[06:31.140 --> 06:32.220]  I would almost take that plant
[06:32.220 --> 06:33.260]  to another part of the house.
[06:33.260 --> 06:35.300]  If it's a home grow, I would go out to the garage
[06:35.300 --> 06:37.200]  and spray it out there,
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.980]  because that way you will not get
[06:38.980 --> 06:40.960]  any of that silver thiosulfate on the plants
[06:40.960 --> 06:43.380]  that you want to remain female.
[06:43.380 --> 06:45.300]  So that's my guidance on that.
[06:45.300 --> 06:48.340]  Also, Fred, let that plant that you sprayed dry
[06:48.340 --> 06:50.860]  before you return it to the grow room with the females,
[06:50.860 --> 06:53.060]  because you don't wanna spread that liquid,
[06:53.060 --> 06:56.500]  dripping silver thiosulfate onto any of the other plants.
[06:56.500 --> 06:58.620]  All right, so that's my guidance on foliar spray
[06:58.620 --> 07:00.580]  or pesticide application.
[07:00.580 --> 07:02.300]  Mainly, don't do it with the lights on,
[07:02.300 --> 07:04.820]  because you don't wanna burn the shit out of the plants.
[07:04.820 --> 07:06.060]  All right, now I've got a news article
[07:06.060 --> 07:07.380]  that I'd like to share with you.
[07:07.380 --> 07:08.780]  This one comes from the Westward,
[07:08.780 --> 07:12.460]  and this article was written by Thomas Mitchell.
[07:12.460 --> 07:14.660]  Make sure you guys check out westward.com.
[07:14.660 --> 07:16.700]  The Westward is a Denver newspaper.
[07:16.700 --> 07:18.420]  Every town has their little local newspaper.
[07:18.420 --> 07:20.700]  The Westward is their little local
[07:20.700 --> 07:22.800]  alternative magazine newspaper type of thing.
[07:22.800 --> 07:24.740]  Make sure you check that out if you're ever in Denver.
[07:24.740 --> 07:26.140]  It's a great publication.
[07:26.780 --> 07:27.660]  If you ever wanna know where all the cool shows are,
[07:27.660 --> 07:30.060]  where the good food is, whatever's going on,
[07:30.060 --> 07:32.220]  that's the article or the magazine to check out.
[07:32.220 --> 07:34.540]  All right, the Westward article goes like this.
[07:34.540 --> 07:36.140]  Something's going on in Pueblo County.
[07:36.140 --> 07:37.900]  You might not notice as you drive through the town,
[07:37.900 --> 07:40.140]  which took a big hit during the steel recession of the 80s
[07:40.140 --> 07:41.660]  and has slowly been coming back,
[07:41.660 --> 07:43.140]  but your nostrils should get a clue
[07:43.140 --> 07:44.300]  once you reach the outskirts
[07:44.300 --> 07:46.600]  where the aroma of cannabis hits you.
[07:46.600 --> 07:49.320]  Although this isn't an unusual odor in Colorado these days,
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.020]  the pot industry is in full bloom
[07:51.020 --> 07:52.940]  in the county surrounding Pueblo.
[07:52.940 --> 07:54.740]  I wish I could write my high school guidance counselor
[07:54.740 --> 07:56.780]  a letter about this, says Michael Cadwell,
[07:56.780 --> 07:59.260]  director of sales for the Los Sueños Cannabis Farm,
[07:59.260 --> 08:01.660]  as he sniffs a bug the size of a football.
[08:01.660 --> 08:03.460]  This is the way we do it, he says.
[08:04.380 --> 08:05.380]  Excuse my coughing, you guys.
[08:05.380 --> 08:07.540]  I was taking some dabs earlier.
[08:07.540 --> 08:09.420]  Los Sueños is a 36-acre farm
[08:09.420 --> 08:11.820]  just outside the city in Pueblo County.
[08:11.820 --> 08:14.260]  It's one of the largest outdoor grows in the country.
[08:14.260 --> 08:16.440]  Unlike Denver County, this one does not require
[08:16.440 --> 08:19.420]  that commercial cannabis cultivation be confined inside,
[08:19.420 --> 08:20.780]  and a stroll through the four fields
[08:20.780 --> 08:23.460]  planted with 55 strains shows what a difference
[08:23.460 --> 08:25.940]  the bright Southern Colorado sun makes.
[08:25.940 --> 08:28.220]  Plants here grow much taller and heavier,
[08:28.220 --> 08:31.020]  and they need to be tied to stakes just to stay upright.
[08:31.020 --> 08:32.420]  The high elevation increase
[08:32.420 --> 08:35.780]  and increase in ultraviolet rays tricks
[08:35.780 --> 08:39.780]  the plant into higher resin production, explains Aaron Hovey,
[08:39.780 --> 08:41.860]  head grower at Los Sueños,
[08:41.860 --> 08:44.900]  and the natural sunlight is virtually year-round, he says.
[08:44.900 --> 08:46.380]  Still, the area can get cold,
[08:46.380 --> 08:49.580]  so when the winter frost hits Los Sueños
[08:49.580 --> 08:51.820]  and outdoor growing becomes unfeasible,
[08:51.820 --> 08:54.660]  Hovey and his team operate in four greenhouses,
[08:54.660 --> 08:56.140]  a more eco-friendly alternative
[08:56.140 --> 08:58.460]  to the light bulb warehouse setups in Denver.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.660]  You can have a thousand lights
[08:59.660 --> 09:01.860]  in some huge warehouse for massive production,
[09:01.860 --> 09:04.820]  but that's not what we're trying to do down here, Hovey says.
[09:04.820 --> 09:06.980]  This is farming cannabis.
[09:06.980 --> 09:08.440]  Hovey grew up in North Carolina,
[09:08.440 --> 09:11.140]  where he started growing marijuana outdoors as a teenager.
[09:11.140 --> 09:12.580]  Despite the objections of his parents
[09:12.580 --> 09:15.820]  and local law enforcement, he honed his craft there
[09:15.820 --> 09:18.900]  before finding a legal haven in Pueblo County,
[09:18.900 --> 09:22.460]  where he now nurtures the lives
[09:22.460 --> 09:24.940]  of more than 10,000 marijuana plants.
[09:24.940 --> 09:26.660]  There's no playbook to growing pot like this,
[09:26.660 --> 09:27.860]  and there are no guarantees
[09:27.860 --> 09:29.540]  with growing in the natural elements,
[09:29.540 --> 09:31.700]  but that's what makes it fun, Hovey says.
[09:31.700 --> 09:34.380]  You can't be successful at this without good help.
[09:34.380 --> 09:35.360]  When the hail and mold hits,
[09:35.360 --> 09:37.840]  you need people who know what they are doing.
[09:39.100 --> 09:40.700]  Hovey is just one of many Coloradans
[09:40.700 --> 09:43.480]  who moved to Pueblo to work with illegal marijuana,
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.740]  but locals are getting in on the action too.
[09:45.740 --> 09:49.620]  More than 1,300 jobs were created in Pueblo County in 2014
[09:49.620 --> 09:51.580]  by the marijuana industry, according to a study
[09:51.580 --> 09:54.860]  by the Southern Colorado Grovers Association,
[09:54.860 --> 09:57.660]  a staffing firm that helps people land marijuana jobs,
[09:57.660 --> 09:59.820]  opened in Pueblo last February.
[09:59.820 --> 10:02.120]  At the same time, industrial vacancies decreased
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.980]  by more than 15%, and marijuana-related businesses
[10:04.980 --> 10:07.820]  accounted for 36% of new commercial building projects
[10:07.820 --> 10:10.020]  in Pueblo County in 2014,
[10:10.020 --> 10:12.940]  according to the Pueblo County Regional Building Department.
[10:12.940 --> 10:15.700]  Folks are quickly realizing that the cost of cultivation
[10:16.540 --> 10:17.700]  is a lot less in greenhouses and outdoors,
[10:17.700 --> 10:20.140]  says Pueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace,
[10:20.140 --> 10:21.900]  who has championed the marijuana industry
[10:21.900 --> 10:24.340]  as a form of economic growth in the area.
[10:24.340 --> 10:29.100]  We have a very sizable rural agrarian portion here.
[10:29.100 --> 10:30.880]  Sorry, I've never read that word before,
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.260]  and I probably should have.
[10:32.260 --> 10:34.380]  When Coloradans voted to legalize the growing
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.860]  and selling of recreational marijuana,
[10:35.860 --> 10:37.780]  they also agreed to allow towns and counties
[10:37.780 --> 10:40.280]  to choose whether or not to allow retail pot businesses
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.580]  within their boundaries.
[10:41.580 --> 10:45.460]  Denver, already the state epicenter of medical marijuana,
[10:46.220 --> 10:47.980]  quickly became the first retail marijuana capital
[10:47.980 --> 10:49.840]  of the world, while much of the rest of the state
[10:49.840 --> 10:51.780]  struggled over the decision of whether to accept
[10:51.780 --> 10:54.980]  pot businesses, and if so, how to regulate them.
[10:54.980 --> 10:56.840]  But Pace and his fellow commissioners were keen
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.300]  on the idea of an agricultural marijuana economy early on,
[11:00.300 --> 11:03.760]  and began issuing cultivation licenses in 2014
[11:03.760 --> 11:06.020]  in hopes of spurring local industry.
[11:06.020 --> 11:07.420]  There are now cultivation licenses
[11:07.420 --> 11:11.100]  for 33 medical operations and 57 recreational operations
[11:11.100 --> 11:13.060]  in Pueblo and Pueblo West County.
[11:14.060 --> 11:17.100]  Let me clarify for people that are not from Colorado,
[11:17.100 --> 11:18.500]  and there was a couple things in that sentence
[11:18.500 --> 11:19.340]  I wanna clarify.
[11:19.340 --> 11:21.300]  It says there are now cultivation licenses
[11:21.300 --> 11:25.640]  for 33 medical operations and 57 recreational operations.
[11:26.940 --> 11:29.020]  Recreational and medical are grown
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.820]  in completely different areas.
[11:31.820 --> 11:34.980]  So if a grow applies to be a legalized grow
[11:34.980 --> 11:37.300]  with the MED, the Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[11:37.300 --> 11:38.980]  they either apply to be a medical grow
[11:38.980 --> 11:41.000]  or a recreational grow.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.080]  And it's just the difference in licensing.
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.120]  It's how your plant count adds up.
[11:46.120 --> 11:48.000]  It's how your cannabis is handled.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.800]  So if your medicine, if the cannabis is grown
[11:50.800 --> 11:53.720]  in a medical facility, it can only be sold
[11:53.720 --> 11:56.640]  to medical retail facilities.
[11:56.640 --> 11:59.240]  If the cannabis is grown in a recreational facility,
[11:59.240 --> 12:04.120]  it can only be sold in a recreational retail establishment.
[12:04.120 --> 12:05.660]  So that's why they make the indication there
[12:05.660 --> 12:09.000]  if it's recreational or a medical marijuana facility.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.440]  And also they talk about Pueblo and Pueblo West County.
[12:12.440 --> 12:14.600]  Those are on the border of each other.
[12:14.600 --> 12:17.080]  And there are a bunch, I think there are 14 or 15
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.080]  dispensaries in Pueblo West, which is just a small,
[12:21.080 --> 12:23.360]  short, quick drive from the city of Pueblo.
[12:23.360 --> 12:24.880]  I actually worked in Pueblo West,
[12:24.880 --> 12:27.040]  and I live in the south side of Pueblo.
[12:27.040 --> 12:28.980]  And it used to take me just 15 or 20 minutes to get there.
[12:28.980 --> 12:31.000]  So it's not like it's a distance.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.880]  And the city of Pueblo does not allow any cannabis sales
[12:33.880 --> 12:35.300]  within city limits.
[12:35.300 --> 12:37.980]  So everything that is sold is just in Pueblo County
[12:37.980 --> 12:39.740]  and Pueblo West.
[12:39.740 --> 12:40.980]  All right, I've gotten off on a tangent.
[12:40.980 --> 12:42.300]  Let's get back to the article.
[12:42.300 --> 12:45.260]  It says, although the city of Pueblo allows cultivation,
[12:45.260 --> 12:47.820]  it's been more guarded in its approach to sales.
[12:47.820 --> 12:50.420]  Recreational pot shops are still under a moratorium
[12:50.420 --> 12:52.220]  in the city until a public vote on the matter
[12:52.220 --> 12:54.280]  in November of 2016.
[12:54.280 --> 12:56.040]  So residents need to purchase their pot
[12:56.040 --> 12:59.180]  at one of the 13 recreational shops in Pueblo County
[12:59.180 --> 13:01.380]  where retail sales are legal.
[13:01.380 --> 13:03.300]  The Pueblo City Council is starting to come around
[13:03.300 --> 13:04.460]  on the medical side, however,
[13:04.460 --> 13:07.580]  and the first MMJ dispensary within Pueblo city limits
[13:08.100 --> 13:09.180]  opened in October.
[13:09.180 --> 13:11.140]  Pueblo natives, Steven and Monique Duran,
[13:11.140 --> 13:12.580]  who've been together for 13 years,
[13:12.580 --> 13:14.580]  started looking into medical marijuana businesses
[13:14.580 --> 13:15.940]  several years ago.
[13:15.940 --> 13:17.940]  He started studying medical marijuana
[13:17.940 --> 13:19.820]  after his shift at the Comanche Power Plant
[13:19.820 --> 13:23.740]  while Monique became a regulatory rules whiz.
[13:23.740 --> 13:26.460]  Finally, after finding one of the rare buildings in Pueblo
[13:26.460 --> 13:29.940]  that met all of the city's stringent zoning requirements
[13:29.940 --> 13:31.280]  for the marijuana operation,
[13:31.280 --> 13:32.420]  which include the location
[13:32.420 --> 13:34.880]  in a small council approved industrial zone,
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.180]  the Durans poured their savings into a lease
[13:37.780 --> 13:40.960]  for the building, which is now the 719 MMJ dispensary.
[13:41.820 --> 13:43.500]  There was a map the city had for us
[13:43.500 --> 13:44.780]  in order to meet the requirements,
[13:44.780 --> 13:46.380]  and it was very, very limited.
[13:46.380 --> 13:49.020]  We found this place, which met all of them, Monique says.
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.700]  Right now it's us and one employee running the store.
[13:51.700 --> 13:53.520]  We're just a couple, but we want to be the model
[13:53.520 --> 13:56.240]  for how to properly medicate patients in Pueblo.
[13:56.240 --> 13:58.300]  There won't be many competitors following that model,
[13:58.300 --> 14:00.220]  though, since zoning maps,
[14:00.220 --> 14:01.660]  the zoning map is so restrictive
[14:01.660 --> 14:03.340]  that only a few more medical dispensaries
[14:03.340 --> 14:06.460]  might manage to find a suitable spot within the city.
[14:06.500 --> 14:08.260]  The couple's inspiration for 719
[14:08.260 --> 14:10.440]  came from watching Steven's sister struggle
[14:10.440 --> 14:12.740]  through the difficulties of multiple sclerosis
[14:12.740 --> 14:15.380]  and seeing how pharmaceutical marijuana medication
[14:15.380 --> 14:16.460]  affected her.
[14:16.460 --> 14:18.180]  This was just a different person on the,
[14:18.180 --> 14:21.380]  she was just a different person on those meds, says Steven.
[14:21.380 --> 14:23.580]  Seeing what real patients have to fight through
[14:23.580 --> 14:25.300]  was some strong motivation.
[14:25.300 --> 14:26.820]  Now, these homegrown owners are happy
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.060]  with what they've created,
[14:28.060 --> 14:29.860]  just coming in the shop and looking around
[14:29.860 --> 14:32.380]  as two kids from Pueblo who never really had much.
[14:32.380 --> 14:34.600]  Sometimes it's like a dream, Monique says.
[14:34.600 --> 14:36.000]  It's such a cool story,
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.560]  and we hope to make it a better one.
[14:38.560 --> 14:40.840]  So big shout out to Pueblo, Colorado.
[14:40.840 --> 14:42.240]  Several years ago, like the article said,
[14:42.240 --> 14:43.400]  this town was falling apart.
[14:43.400 --> 14:45.840]  When I used to tell people that I'm from Pueblo, Colorado,
[14:45.840 --> 14:46.700]  they would laugh at me.
[14:46.700 --> 14:49.040]  They would not take me seriously.
[14:49.040 --> 14:51.320]  Now when I'm in Denver or Colorado Springs
[14:51.320 --> 14:52.920]  and I say that I am from Pueblo,
[14:52.920 --> 14:53.740]  a lot of people are like,
[14:53.740 --> 14:56.120]  oh, you got a lot of weed going on down there, don't you?
[14:56.120 --> 14:58.860]  And so we're starting to get a little bit of respect
[14:58.860 --> 15:00.120]  in the cannabis industry.
[15:00.120 --> 15:01.600]  So big shout out to the Westward.
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.560]  Thanks for publishing an article about us.
[15:03.560 --> 15:04.960]  I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[15:04.960 --> 15:06.240]  You guys, I need to take a drink,
[15:06.240 --> 15:08.320]  and then I will be right back to talk a little bit
[15:08.320 --> 15:10.800]  about how I got into the cannabis industry.
[15:10.800 --> 15:11.640]  Hang tight.
[15:11.640 --> 15:36.740]  ♪ Hey, hey, let me see your rollie top on my billy top ♪
[15:36.740 --> 15:37.780]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[15:37.780 --> 15:39.220]  I took a drink as promised,
[15:39.220 --> 15:40.500]  and as any good dabber would do,
[15:40.500 --> 15:42.980]  I took a couple of fat dabs while I was off the mic.
[15:42.980 --> 15:45.340]  Spared you the coughing into the microphone.
[15:45.340 --> 15:47.500]  What I was dabbing, I wanna share this with you.
[15:47.500 --> 15:49.140]  I was dabbing, where's the package?
[15:49.140 --> 15:49.960]  Here we go.
[15:49.960 --> 15:51.980]  I've got a little bit of LA Kush.
[15:52.020 --> 15:55.140]  It's LA Confidential crossed to some OG Kush,
[15:55.140 --> 15:57.780]  but this is PHO wax.
[15:57.780 --> 15:59.940]  Most of the time I'm smoking BHO.
[15:59.940 --> 16:02.660]  Most of the shatter and dabs that you see
[16:02.660 --> 16:05.940]  available on the market right now are made with butane.
[16:05.940 --> 16:08.900]  This hash was made with propane.
[16:08.900 --> 16:10.820]  Let me open up some shatter that was made with butane
[16:10.820 --> 16:12.340]  so that I can compare them side by side
[16:12.340 --> 16:14.260]  and kind of give you a little better description
[16:14.260 --> 16:15.400]  of what I'm working with here.
[16:15.400 --> 16:18.220]  So the shatter, most of you guys are familiar with shatter.
[16:18.220 --> 16:20.500]  Shatter is an ambery colored,
[16:20.500 --> 16:24.760]  sort of a honey colored slab of shatter.
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.820]  It's a little thin sheet of real,
[16:28.820 --> 16:30.460]  if I bend it, it cracks.
[16:30.460 --> 16:32.300]  Like it'll just pop off and some of it will chip off
[16:32.300 --> 16:33.620]  and go flying away.
[16:33.620 --> 16:35.200]  When you're watching Jurassic Park,
[16:35.200 --> 16:38.180]  all those big slabs of like the amber resin
[16:38.180 --> 16:40.780]  that the bugs are kept in, that the bugs are stuck in,
[16:40.780 --> 16:42.520]  that is what shatter looks like in my opinion.
[16:42.520 --> 16:44.440]  I think that stuff looks like shatter.
[16:44.440 --> 16:46.160]  So compared to the shatter,
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.800]  I'm gonna open up this PHO and take a look.
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.840]  This is propane honey oil.
[16:50.840 --> 16:55.120]  It looks like, man, it looks like a piece of soap.
[16:55.120 --> 16:56.920]  It's really lightly colored.
[16:56.920 --> 17:00.000]  It almost resembles, since it's holiday time,
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.280]  this looks like a small piece
[17:01.280 --> 17:03.440]  of Amanda's peanut butter fudge.
[17:03.440 --> 17:05.680]  Yeah, if somebody cut Amanda's peanut butter fudge
[17:05.680 --> 17:09.180]  perfectly smooth, I think it would look just like this stuff.
[17:09.180 --> 17:10.960]  I just noticed that there was a kind of a shitty
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.520]  technical difficulty with my microphone.
[17:12.520 --> 17:15.240]  So I apologize if part of the show was subpar quality,
[17:15.240 --> 17:16.480]  that is not my style.
[17:16.480 --> 17:18.200]  I'll do my best to fix it, but I just noticed
[17:18.200 --> 17:20.040]  that there wasn't something working properly.
[17:20.040 --> 17:21.640]  So shout out to the failed cable.
[17:21.640 --> 17:23.080]  Pretty sure it's just an XLR cable
[17:23.080 --> 17:24.700]  that needs to be replaced, not a big deal.
[17:24.700 --> 17:26.200]  Anyway, I was talking about this hash.
[17:26.200 --> 17:28.560]  I'm picking some of it up right now.
[17:28.560 --> 17:30.920]  This is much easier to handle and deal with
[17:30.920 --> 17:32.800]  and work with than shatter.
[17:32.800 --> 17:33.900]  Shatter is real sticky.
[17:33.900 --> 17:35.560]  It'll stick to your fingers.
[17:35.560 --> 17:36.840]  When you break it, it'll break off.
[17:36.840 --> 17:39.080]  When your fingers heat it up, it gets kind of goopy.
[17:39.080 --> 17:41.660]  I'm holding onto this PHO and I would be able,
[17:41.660 --> 17:44.080]  I am able to break off little dabs for myself.
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.280]  I'm able to break off big ass dabs for myself
[17:46.280 --> 17:48.040]  and little dabs for my friends.
[17:48.040 --> 17:49.520]  It's much easier to handle.
[17:49.520 --> 17:51.040]  I just took a few dabs of it.
[17:51.040 --> 17:52.640]  One thing that I can really say,
[17:53.820 --> 17:56.340]  this stuff is flavorful.
[17:56.340 --> 17:59.920]  It's got a really sweet, really dank flavor to it.
[17:59.920 --> 18:02.280]  I can't even properly describe the flavor of it.
[18:02.280 --> 18:03.760]  It's got a cushy flavor to it.
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.720]  It tastes, the essence of cannabis is really in the PHO.
[18:07.720 --> 18:09.560]  I was skeptical at first,
[18:09.560 --> 18:12.000]  but a friend of mine that works at a dispensary,
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.920]  she convinced me that I wanted to try some of it.
[18:14.760 --> 18:16.080]  So I grabbed myself a gram and you know what?
[18:16.080 --> 18:17.000]  I approve.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.160]  So let me give a shout out to the company here.
[18:19.160 --> 18:21.080]  I don't usually do this because I am affiliated
[18:21.080 --> 18:23.180]  with another facility,
[18:23.180 --> 18:24.640]  but I am gonna give a huge shout out
[18:24.640 --> 18:29.640]  to the Kraft Concentrates for their LA Kush PHO wax.
[18:29.880 --> 18:32.220]  The stuff is tasty and I do approve.
[18:32.220 --> 18:33.640]  So a big shout out to my friend Jessica
[18:33.640 --> 18:35.600]  for convincing me to pick up a gram.
[18:35.600 --> 18:36.440]  What up, Jess?
[18:36.440 --> 18:38.000]  I appreciate the recommendation.
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.200]  Good shit.
[18:39.200 --> 18:41.320]  Everybody buy some, take dabs of it.
[18:41.320 --> 18:42.160]  I love it.
[18:42.200 --> 18:44.880]  All right, so I said I was gonna come back
[18:44.880 --> 18:46.280]  and choke into the microphone a whole bunch.
[18:46.280 --> 18:47.300]  Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
[18:47.300 --> 18:48.140]  That was gross.
[18:48.140 --> 18:49.440]  Anyway, I said I was gonna come back
[18:49.440 --> 18:52.220]  and talk a little bit about how I got myself
[18:52.220 --> 18:54.320]  into the cannabis industry.
[18:54.320 --> 18:56.080]  Let me get into that.
[18:56.080 --> 18:57.720]  I'm grabbing, I wrote a couple of little notes here.
[18:57.720 --> 18:58.560]  Nothing major.
[18:58.560 --> 18:59.640]  I just took a couple little bullet points
[18:59.640 --> 19:00.760]  while I was dabbing.
[19:00.760 --> 19:03.920]  So I wanted to say that I was in the cannabis industry
[19:03.920 --> 19:06.340]  illegally before the cannabis industry ever existed,
[19:06.340 --> 19:07.180]  you guys.
[19:08.260 --> 19:10.520]  I don't know how much of this I should talk about or admit,
[19:10.520 --> 19:11.920]  but we're beyond that, right?
[19:12.680 --> 19:14.640]  The statute of limitations is probably gone,
[19:14.640 --> 19:16.560]  if I admit to any criminal activity.
[19:16.560 --> 19:19.000]  Anyway, when I moved here from California,
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.500]  I was going to high school here,
[19:20.500 --> 19:22.900]  and our little crew was on a camping trip
[19:22.900 --> 19:25.400]  and somebody pulled out a pipe and we started smoking.
[19:25.400 --> 19:27.320]  And I was like, nice, some weed,
[19:27.320 --> 19:29.720]  because I hadn't seen weed since I'd left California.
[19:29.720 --> 19:31.280]  So we got stoned.
[19:31.280 --> 19:33.760]  And then I was like, all right, all my friends smoke weed.
[19:33.760 --> 19:35.320]  That means we're gonna have to find somewhere to buy weed.
[19:35.320 --> 19:37.620]  And none of our crew really had a weed guy yet.
[19:37.620 --> 19:39.360]  And I knew that a couple of the guys at school
[19:39.360 --> 19:40.680]  were hustling weed,
[19:40.680 --> 19:41.960]  but they didn't really,
[19:41.960 --> 19:43.520]  there were some racial tensions there.
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.960]  At my school back in that time,
[19:45.960 --> 19:48.080]  the Mexican guys hung out with the Mexican guys
[19:48.080 --> 19:49.680]  and the white guys hung out with the white guys.
[19:49.680 --> 19:50.880]  And we didn't fight or anything.
[19:50.880 --> 19:53.280]  It's just kind of what those groups did.
[19:54.920 --> 19:56.360]  There was just no reason for us to mix.
[19:56.360 --> 19:58.600]  We were over here listening to Green Day and Nirvana
[19:58.600 --> 20:00.240]  and Phish, and they were over there listening to,
[20:00.240 --> 20:03.040]  I don't even know, Cypress Hill is one of the things
[20:03.040 --> 20:04.240]  I remember they listened to a whole bunch of.
[20:04.240 --> 20:07.720]  But anyway, I was brave enough to hit up
[20:07.720 --> 20:09.640]  one of the Mexican guys that I knew sold weed.
[20:09.640 --> 20:11.360]  I was like, hey, think you'd sell me some weed?
[20:11.360 --> 20:13.040]  And he was kind of leery about it at first,
[20:13.040 --> 20:15.120]  but he's like, yep, you have to buy ounces.
[20:15.120 --> 20:17.080]  And at that time, we were just high school kids.
[20:17.080 --> 20:18.600]  So an ounce was a little bit of a stretch.
[20:18.600 --> 20:20.000]  So I made it happen.
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.400]  I bought an ounce and I started hustling
[20:21.400 --> 20:23.360]  a little bit of that herb to my friends.
[20:23.360 --> 20:27.120]  And then those guys were heavily connected
[20:27.120 --> 20:28.480]  and they were like, you're moving ounces.
[20:28.480 --> 20:29.720]  You're gonna start moving pounds now.
[20:29.720 --> 20:30.920]  And they started throwing me pounds
[20:30.920 --> 20:32.320]  for dirty, dirty cheap around here.
[20:32.320 --> 20:34.320]  In this town, I had the cheapest hookup
[20:34.320 --> 20:36.640]  on pounds around here for a while.
[20:36.640 --> 20:38.360]  Until one day I was selling a pound
[20:38.360 --> 20:42.040]  on the east side of town and a couple of guys
[20:42.040 --> 20:44.880]  with face tattoos and assault rifles walked up to my car
[20:44.880 --> 20:46.480]  and they did not take my shit from me.
[20:46.480 --> 20:48.840]  I was so amazed, but they told me that I was not allowed
[20:48.840 --> 20:51.200]  to be selling my product on that side of town,
[20:51.200 --> 20:52.880]  that I was able to sell my product
[20:52.880 --> 20:54.340]  on the north and south ends of town,
[20:54.340 --> 20:56.360]  but don't fuck with the east and west side.
[20:56.360 --> 20:57.240]  And if they see me again,
[20:57.240 --> 20:58.840]  they're gonna take all my shit from me.
[20:58.840 --> 21:00.520]  And they sent me home nicely.
[21:00.520 --> 21:03.080]  So I kind of just became the street dude.
[21:03.080 --> 21:05.520]  I hustled the brick weed, the Mexican brick weed
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.800]  from a couple of friends that were just flooding it to me.
[21:07.800 --> 21:10.180]  So since none of the other white guys in my neighborhood
[21:10.180 --> 21:11.840]  wanted to talk to these Mexican guys,
[21:11.840 --> 21:13.680]  I was just getting pounds from the Mexican guys
[21:13.680 --> 21:15.700]  and just selling it to all my gringo friends
[21:15.700 --> 21:16.740]  and it was working out for me.
[21:16.740 --> 21:18.960]  So that's kind of where I made my break into the weed scene.
[21:18.960 --> 21:20.720]  That's how I learned how to hustle.
[21:22.020 --> 21:23.800]  All of that is a fictional tale.
[21:23.800 --> 21:25.760]  If you were involved in any sort of law enforcement,
[21:25.760 --> 21:26.600]  I just made that up.
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.480]  I'm writing a book and that is all going to be
[21:28.480 --> 21:29.760]  in the fictional book I'm writing.
[21:29.760 --> 21:31.040]  All right, so how's that feel?
[21:31.040 --> 21:33.720]  All right, so then let's see.
[21:33.760 --> 21:35.720]  I'm smoking and hustling and doing my thing.
[21:35.720 --> 21:38.520]  Several years go by and then I learned how to grow.
[21:38.520 --> 21:40.240]  Actually, I learned how to grow.
[21:42.640 --> 21:45.120]  I had a guy that lived in the same apartment building as me
[21:45.120 --> 21:47.160]  when I was like seven years old.
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.880]  And that guy was growing weed in his backyard.
[21:48.880 --> 21:51.820]  And I would listen to his conversations
[21:51.820 --> 21:55.180]  between my friend Wayne and my uncle Eric and this dude.
[21:55.180 --> 21:56.920]  And they would talk about how to grow weed.
[21:56.920 --> 21:58.880]  And I was like somewhere between seven and 10 years old
[21:58.880 --> 21:59.880]  when I lived there.
[21:59.880 --> 22:02.740]  And I absorbed so much information from that conversation
[22:02.740 --> 22:04.420]  that I felt like I was destined to grow weed
[22:04.420 --> 22:05.940]  at some point in time.
[22:05.940 --> 22:08.660]  So we jumped way forward into the early 2000s.
[22:08.660 --> 22:10.940]  I couldn't even tell you exactly which year.
[22:10.940 --> 22:14.540]  A friend of mine was growing some weed in Colorado
[22:14.540 --> 22:16.000]  and he needed a hand.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.020]  And so I went and helped him out.
[22:17.020 --> 22:18.300]  He didn't let me do a whole bunch,
[22:18.300 --> 22:21.060]  but he exposed me to some things.
[22:21.060 --> 22:23.100]  And so I learned how to do that.
[22:23.100 --> 22:23.940]  And then I got good at that.
[22:23.940 --> 22:26.180]  And then I moved to Lawrence, Kansas.
[22:26.180 --> 22:28.580]  That just for unrelated reasons, for musical reasons.
[22:28.580 --> 22:31.340]  I chased a band, chased the dream of being in a band
[22:31.340 --> 22:33.420]  and went and played in Lawrence, Kansas for several years,
[22:33.420 --> 22:34.420]  traveled around the Midwest.
[22:34.420 --> 22:37.620]  But anyway, a friend of mine there had a place
[22:37.620 --> 22:39.220]  where we would play music.
[22:39.220 --> 22:42.540]  And one day I was playing the drums and I looked up.
[22:42.540 --> 22:43.380]  I don't know why I looked up.
[22:43.380 --> 22:45.060]  When you're playing the drums, your eyes just wander.
[22:45.060 --> 22:46.060]  Your eyes just go places.
[22:46.060 --> 22:47.940]  You get bored of staring at the guitar player's back all day
[22:47.940 --> 22:50.000]  because the guitar player's asses are all to you.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.620]  So I looked up and I see this light coming from the attic.
[22:53.620 --> 22:54.940]  And I'm like, oh shit,
[22:54.940 --> 22:56.500]  that's a high intensity discharge light.
[22:56.500 --> 22:58.100]  They've got an HPS light up there.
[22:58.100 --> 22:59.900]  They're growing some fucking weed up there.
[22:59.900 --> 23:01.340]  And it's just like the crawl space in the garage,
[23:01.340 --> 23:02.860]  a little storage area.
[23:02.860 --> 23:04.520]  So I waited for everybody to leave
[23:04.520 --> 23:05.980]  except for the dude that owns the place.
[23:05.980 --> 23:06.820]  It was his space.
[23:06.820 --> 23:08.740]  And I go, hey bro, not to be an asshole,
[23:08.740 --> 23:10.620]  but I got hit in the face with the grow light
[23:10.620 --> 23:11.580]  a couple of times up there.
[23:11.580 --> 23:13.120]  What you got up there?
[23:13.120 --> 23:14.820]  And he kind of looked at me like, huh?
[23:14.820 --> 23:15.660]  We'd smoked together.
[23:15.660 --> 23:16.500]  We drank together.
[23:16.500 --> 23:17.460]  We're bros.
[23:17.460 --> 23:19.460]  So he goes, what do you know about a grow?
[23:19.460 --> 23:20.980]  And I was like, I'm okay in a grow.
[23:20.980 --> 23:22.500]  I've never been like in charge of a grow,
[23:22.500 --> 23:24.620]  but I've been a helper plenty of times, you know?
[23:24.620 --> 23:26.820]  And he's like, well then come up here, help me out.
[23:26.820 --> 23:27.780]  And he's like, I got a problem.
[23:27.780 --> 23:28.740]  I need help doing this.
[23:28.740 --> 23:30.060]  And I'm going to be out of town for a few days.
[23:30.060 --> 23:30.900]  Can you take over?
[23:30.900 --> 23:31.720]  And I was like, sure.
[23:31.720 --> 23:34.720]  So he goes out of town and he ended up getting in trouble.
[23:34.720 --> 23:36.500]  And he was gone for several days,
[23:36.500 --> 23:37.640]  way more days than expected.
[23:37.640 --> 23:39.420]  So I kind of took care of that crop.
[23:39.420 --> 23:41.980]  Harvest time came and I was there
[23:41.980 --> 23:42.820]  through the whole harvest.
[23:42.820 --> 23:44.100]  I helped the dude pull down the plants.
[23:44.100 --> 23:44.940]  I helped him trim.
[23:44.940 --> 23:47.620]  I got paid pretty decently for helping him trim some weed.
[23:47.620 --> 23:48.860]  And this was in Kansas, you guys.
[23:48.860 --> 23:50.100]  So I got paid a little extra
[23:50.100 --> 23:52.180]  because we were really running a risk being in Kansas.
[23:52.180 --> 23:55.000]  The laws, it was still completely illegal.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.620]  And we were growing in basically a jam space
[23:57.620 --> 23:59.540]  where we had our band practice set up.
[23:59.540 --> 24:02.100]  So we were begging for attention every day
[24:02.100 --> 24:03.920]  with plants just right above my head.
[24:03.920 --> 24:05.780]  I could reach up and touch the ceiling
[24:05.780 --> 24:07.420]  where these plants were sitting on actually,
[24:07.420 --> 24:09.260]  which would be the floor on the opposite side.
[24:09.260 --> 24:13.220]  So I got to finish that crop with my buddy in Kansas.
[24:13.220 --> 24:15.660]  I actually brought some of that that we grew.
[24:15.660 --> 24:18.260]  What I got paid with, I brought that back to Colorado
[24:18.260 --> 24:19.780]  and shared that with a lot of my friends here.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.780]  And my friends were like, dude, you guys kind of killed it.
[24:21.780 --> 24:23.840]  And they were kind of impressed with my herb.
[24:23.840 --> 24:26.580]  So I had to move back to Colorado for some family reasons.
[24:26.580 --> 24:27.740]  My grandparents were passing.
[24:27.740 --> 24:30.620]  I came to spend the kind of final days with them.
[24:30.620 --> 24:32.780]  It was one of my good excuses to get away.
[24:32.780 --> 24:34.660]  Lawrence, Kansas was fucking me up, you guys.
[24:34.660 --> 24:35.580]  I became an alcoholic.
[24:35.580 --> 24:36.780]  I became a drug addict.
[24:36.780 --> 24:38.360]  I needed to get away from there and change my life.
[24:38.360 --> 24:41.700]  And honestly, I have not drank since Lawrence, Kansas.
[24:41.700 --> 24:44.260]  Not blaming it on Kansas, but once I left there,
[24:44.260 --> 24:45.860]  I was able to get away from that lifestyle.
[24:45.860 --> 24:47.440]  And I feel like I'm way more productive.
[24:47.440 --> 24:50.060]  Anyway, I moved back to Colorado
[24:50.060 --> 24:53.600]  and I get a medical marijuana card.
[24:53.600 --> 24:56.040]  And, because there's not a lot of weed
[24:56.040 --> 24:56.880]  on the streets anymore.
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.160]  And the weed that I can find isn't up to the expectations
[25:00.160 --> 25:01.000]  that I'm looking for.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.600]  And it's not as available as I would like it to be.
[25:03.600 --> 25:06.000]  So I get a medical marijuana card.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.020]  And I told myself that when I got this medical marijuana
[25:08.020 --> 25:09.600]  card, I would quit drinking.
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.740]  Now that there's as much cannabis available as I want,
[25:11.740 --> 25:13.320]  why do I need to drink, right?
[25:13.320 --> 25:15.280]  So I go to a couple of dispensaries
[25:15.280 --> 25:16.200]  and some of them were okay.
[25:16.200 --> 25:18.080]  This was when it was the wild, wild west, you guys.
[25:18.080 --> 25:19.720]  This was way different.
[25:19.720 --> 25:21.000]  So I go to a couple of dispensaries
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.840]  and I don't really see anything that impresses me,
[25:22.880 --> 25:25.240]  but I made friends all over the industry.
[25:25.240 --> 25:27.000]  And then one day somebody told me,
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.840]  hey, there's a new dispensary in your neighborhood,
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.960]  but it's kind of a private deal.
[25:30.960 --> 25:33.680]  And they told me that you had to call this number first
[25:33.680 --> 25:35.120]  and then they would tell you where to go.
[25:35.120 --> 25:36.320]  And then you had to knock on the door
[25:36.320 --> 25:38.740]  at the back of this building and they would let you in.
[25:38.740 --> 25:41.040]  So I get my card ready.
[25:41.040 --> 25:43.080]  I get my ID and I called the number and the guy's like,
[25:43.080 --> 25:44.520]  sure, I'll be home in about a half hour.
[25:44.520 --> 25:45.340]  It's my house.
[25:45.340 --> 25:46.760]  Just come knock on my door.
[25:46.760 --> 25:48.320]  So I knock on his door and he lets me in.
[25:48.320 --> 25:49.280]  He's up.
[25:49.280 --> 25:51.080]  So there was an old health food store downtown
[25:51.080 --> 25:52.880]  and it was a three story building.
[25:52.880 --> 25:54.880]  And you have to walk up to the back stairs
[25:54.880 --> 25:56.480]  to the third story and knock on the door.
[25:56.480 --> 25:58.480]  And this dude had an apartment up there.
[25:58.480 --> 25:59.920]  And he would ask for your ID
[25:59.920 --> 26:01.560]  and your medical marijuana card.
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.160]  Then he would have you sit on the couch
[26:03.160 --> 26:04.920]  and then he would light up a joint and smoke with you.
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.840]  And then after you smoked about half the joint,
[26:06.840 --> 26:10.000]  he would bring out a couple of different bags of weed.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.520]  I remember one of the first ones he showed me
[26:11.520 --> 26:12.560]  was chocolate chunk.
[26:12.560 --> 26:15.520]  And then he had AK-47 Northern Lights.
[26:15.520 --> 26:16.440]  And there was another one.
[26:16.440 --> 26:17.280]  I can't remember.
[26:17.280 --> 26:18.120]  I wish I remembered,
[26:18.120 --> 26:20.340]  but I remember the chocolate chunk got my attention.
[26:20.340 --> 26:21.500]  So he comes and shows me,
[26:21.500 --> 26:22.820]  he shows you these strains.
[26:22.820 --> 26:25.180]  And then he only let me buy a quarter the first time.
[26:25.180 --> 26:26.020]  He's like, no, I don't know you.
[26:26.020 --> 26:26.840]  I don't know.
[26:26.840 --> 26:28.100]  He checked my medical marijuana papers too.
[26:28.100 --> 26:31.160]  He made a copy of my ID and my medical marijuana card
[26:31.160 --> 26:33.300]  and sold me a quarter
[26:33.300 --> 26:35.260]  and told me that I could come back every day if I wanted.
[26:35.260 --> 26:36.520]  And we'd make friends and all that stuff.
[26:36.520 --> 26:40.500]  So I was kind of grabbing herb for other people.
[26:40.500 --> 26:42.980]  I would go get weed for the girl I was dating at the time.
[26:42.980 --> 26:44.700]  I would grab weed for my neighbor.
[26:44.700 --> 26:46.940]  There was a DJ friend of mine who needed weed all the time.
[26:46.940 --> 26:48.340]  And I was the only one that really knew
[26:48.340 --> 26:50.460]  about this dispensary in my group.
[26:50.460 --> 26:52.180]  So I would go there every day.
[26:52.180 --> 26:53.820]  I would gather all my friend's money.
[26:53.820 --> 26:54.820]  I'd go to this dispensary.
[26:54.820 --> 26:55.660]  I'd ring the doorbell.
[26:55.660 --> 26:56.480]  I'd call him up.
[26:56.480 --> 26:57.740]  I'd bring the doorbell.
[26:57.740 --> 26:59.420]  And then he'd let me in and we'd sit on the couch,
[26:59.420 --> 27:00.260]  smoke a joint.
[27:00.260 --> 27:01.240]  And he'd sell me a couple of quarters.
[27:01.240 --> 27:02.080]  And every day I'd go,
[27:02.080 --> 27:04.120]  he'd sell me a little bit more and a little bit more.
[27:04.120 --> 27:05.220]  Then he'd be like, so what are you doing?
[27:05.220 --> 27:06.860]  I'd be like, this is just for the people on my block,
[27:06.860 --> 27:08.940]  the people that sit in my basement and smoke weed all day.
[27:08.940 --> 27:10.340]  Instead of them smoking all my weed,
[27:10.340 --> 27:12.100]  I'm grabbing weed for everybody.
[27:12.100 --> 27:13.820]  And he's like, all right, cool.
[27:13.820 --> 27:14.760]  So one day I show up
[27:14.760 --> 27:16.680]  and I could tell that he's overwhelmed with work.
[27:16.680 --> 27:18.360]  He was just completely slammed.
[27:18.360 --> 27:19.620]  I walk up the stairs and I could see
[27:19.620 --> 27:21.080]  that he's been carrying shit up the stairs
[27:21.080 --> 27:22.280]  and it's all piled up by the door.
[27:22.280 --> 27:24.440]  And I could tell that he's getting ready to transplant.
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.240]  And I was like, you're gonna transplant some plants, bro?
[27:26.240 --> 27:28.120]  And he goes, yeah, you ever done that before?
[27:28.120 --> 27:28.960]  And I was like, oh yeah,
[27:28.960 --> 27:30.760]  I've transplanted a whole bunch of plants in my life.
[27:30.760 --> 27:31.600]  Because I have at this point,
[27:31.600 --> 27:33.320]  I've been growing for a little bit.
[27:33.320 --> 27:35.280]  I've helped with a couple other gardens.
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.560]  And of course I got that little lesson
[27:36.560 --> 27:38.560]  when I was a little kid from my grower neighbor
[27:38.560 --> 27:39.960]  in the apartment building.
[27:39.960 --> 27:41.320]  So I was like, yeah, I can definitely help you.
[27:41.320 --> 27:44.200]  And he goes, tell you what, come back tomorrow.
[27:44.640 --> 27:45.800]  Come back at like 10 in the morning
[27:45.800 --> 27:47.120]  and we'll do all of this tomorrow.
[27:47.120 --> 27:48.240]  I'll show you the grow and everything.
[27:48.240 --> 27:49.080]  And I was like, cool.
[27:49.080 --> 27:49.900]  So I go back.
[27:49.900 --> 27:50.960]  Of course I show up a few minutes early
[27:50.960 --> 27:52.320]  and he's impressed by that.
[27:52.320 --> 27:53.680]  We smoke and get good and stoned.
[27:53.680 --> 27:54.800]  And then he shows me the grow.
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.200]  They had a bunch of lights.
[27:56.200 --> 27:57.920]  This was a third story building that they had.
[27:57.920 --> 28:00.040]  His apartment was on the top story.
[28:00.040 --> 28:04.040]  The middle story was all the big grow.
[28:04.040 --> 28:05.720]  And so he shows me the grow and he's like,
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.400]  we need to pot all of these pots into bigger pots.
[28:08.400 --> 28:09.980]  And so I'm like, cool, let's do it.
[28:09.980 --> 28:11.600]  And it took me like, I don't know,
[28:11.600 --> 28:13.040]  maybe seven hours to do all those.
[28:13.040 --> 28:14.360]  He watched me do a few and he's like,
[28:14.360 --> 28:15.480]  shit, this guy knows what he's doing.
[28:15.480 --> 28:17.280]  And he just went out and did his own business
[28:17.280 --> 28:19.260]  and left me there to do those pots.
[28:19.260 --> 28:21.320]  I went up, back up the stairs and got him.
[28:21.320 --> 28:22.680]  I was like, hey bro, these are all done.
[28:22.680 --> 28:24.920]  And he's like, cool, we will pay you at the end of the week
[28:24.920 --> 28:26.080]  because everybody gets paychecks
[28:26.080 --> 28:27.120]  at the end of the week around here.
[28:27.120 --> 28:28.480]  I'll have money then.
[28:28.480 --> 28:29.600]  I just come back at the end of the week
[28:29.600 --> 28:30.760]  and I'll give you some money.
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.280]  Or you can have credit at the store
[28:32.280 --> 28:33.880]  because you shop here anyway.
[28:33.880 --> 28:35.640]  And I was like, I'm good on herb.
[28:35.640 --> 28:36.720]  You know, I've been buying a bunch of weed.
[28:36.720 --> 28:37.560]  I'm cool.
[28:37.560 --> 28:39.160]  I'll just come back at the end of the week and get money.
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.400]  And then, so I would show up for the next few days
[28:42.400 --> 28:44.480]  and I would go to buy my regular quarter
[28:44.480 --> 28:46.520]  or half ounce or whatever I was getting for the crew.
[28:46.520 --> 28:47.720]  And I would just bring cash for that.
[28:47.720 --> 28:49.120]  But then he would always have work for me
[28:49.120 --> 28:49.960]  when I would show up.
[28:49.960 --> 28:51.160]  He'd be like, well, you transplanted those.
[28:51.160 --> 28:52.280]  Do you know how to cut clones?
[28:52.280 --> 28:53.360]  And I was like, I know how to cut clones.
[28:53.360 --> 28:54.440]  Let's do this.
[28:54.440 --> 28:56.480]  So we go into the little room and we cut like 100 clones.
[28:56.480 --> 28:58.040]  And he's like, write down how many hours you worked
[28:58.040 --> 28:59.240]  and we'll pay you on Friday or whatever.
[28:59.240 --> 29:00.320]  And I was like, cool.
[29:00.320 --> 29:02.120]  So throughout the week, I work a few hours
[29:02.120 --> 29:03.400]  and Friday comes along and he's like,
[29:03.400 --> 29:04.680]  how many hours do you think you worked?
[29:04.680 --> 29:06.400]  And I was like, you probably owe me, you know,
[29:06.400 --> 29:08.440]  a couple hundred bucks or whatever I came up with.
[29:08.440 --> 29:10.000]  I don't remember the numbers now.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.320]  And he's like, well, here, the boss sent you this.
[29:12.320 --> 29:14.320]  And he handed me a nice stack of cash.
[29:14.320 --> 29:15.920]  And I was like, that's way too much money, bro.
[29:15.920 --> 29:17.480]  And he goes, well, we want you to come work for us
[29:17.480 --> 29:20.240]  every week and we want you here from like 10 to five
[29:20.240 --> 29:22.760]  every day and we'll pay you this much every week
[29:22.760 --> 29:24.520]  if you just show up and do the work.
[29:24.520 --> 29:26.200]  And I was like, holy shit, okay.
[29:26.200 --> 29:29.120]  So this dude was running the dispensary out of his bedroom
[29:29.120 --> 29:32.120]  and I was running the grow on the second story.
[29:32.120 --> 29:33.960]  And then he would have to go run errands.
[29:33.960 --> 29:35.800]  He would do deliveries also at this time.
[29:36.120 --> 29:37.800]  It might've been illegal back in the day, but whatever.
[29:37.800 --> 29:38.880]  That's already passed.
[29:38.880 --> 29:41.760]  He was going to do deliveries and he'd be like,
[29:41.760 --> 29:43.680]  hey bro, people are coming up to the store.
[29:43.680 --> 29:44.920]  Will you be able to help them out?
[29:44.920 --> 29:46.480]  And I was like, I got this.
[29:46.480 --> 29:47.640]  And so one night I'm helping,
[29:47.640 --> 29:49.560]  we actually had medical marijuana patients
[29:49.560 --> 29:50.400]  that would show up.
[29:50.400 --> 29:53.880]  These people were really sick and we were a real dispensary.
[29:53.880 --> 29:56.520]  So one night there was an elderly couple came
[29:56.520 --> 29:57.680]  and I'll never forget them.
[29:57.680 --> 30:01.560]  This lady was actually sick and we sat on the couch.
[30:01.560 --> 30:03.260]  And as I was having the conversation,
[30:03.260 --> 30:06.180]  the guy that was running this dispensary showed up
[30:06.180 --> 30:08.060]  and he got to hear me explain the differences
[30:08.060 --> 30:10.060]  between Indica's and sativas.
[30:10.060 --> 30:12.900]  And he let me, he got to hear me kind of
[30:13.820 --> 30:14.860]  caregive for this woman.
[30:14.860 --> 30:17.140]  I had built a relationship with her over a few minutes
[30:17.140 --> 30:18.940]  and figured out what's wrong with her.
[30:18.940 --> 30:21.380]  Why she's sick, how she likes to consume cannabis,
[30:21.380 --> 30:24.020]  what she's consuming for, how it makes her feel.
[30:24.020 --> 30:25.940]  If Indica's or sativas work better for her,
[30:25.940 --> 30:28.500]  what the difference is between Indica's and sativas.
[30:28.500 --> 30:30.660]  I spent 30 minutes talking with this lady
[30:30.660 --> 30:32.660]  to make sure that I sold her the right cannabis
[30:32.660 --> 30:34.020]  and to make her feel comfortable.
[30:34.020 --> 30:36.340]  It was her first time buying cannabis from a store.
[30:36.340 --> 30:37.860]  So this dude that actually ran the place
[30:37.860 --> 30:39.820]  walked in and saw me doing this.
[30:39.820 --> 30:42.140]  And he's like, bro, you are amazing at that.
[30:42.140 --> 30:43.380]  I have no business doing it
[30:43.380 --> 30:45.420]  after seeing what you just did with that lady.
[30:45.420 --> 30:47.420]  So he's like, you are kind of now the bud tender guy.
[30:47.420 --> 30:48.920]  There wasn't, the word bud tender,
[30:48.920 --> 30:50.900]  I don't think existed at that point.
[30:50.900 --> 30:52.420]  So he's like, you are now the sales guy.
[30:52.420 --> 30:53.780]  You're gonna be dealing with the customers.
[30:53.780 --> 30:55.260]  And I was like, I've got this.
[30:55.260 --> 30:57.620]  So I would grow weed most of the day
[30:57.620 --> 30:59.280]  and deal with the customers.
[30:59.280 --> 31:00.460]  And then I realized, I was like,
[31:00.460 --> 31:02.420]  we've got a dispensary on the third story.
[31:03.180 --> 31:04.460]  I was like, why don't we have this down on the first floor
[31:04.460 --> 31:05.660]  where everybody can access it?
[31:05.660 --> 31:08.580]  And they said that the city asked them not to do that.
[31:08.580 --> 31:12.220]  And I was like, well, we've got all of the proper licensing.
[31:12.220 --> 31:13.140]  Monday when I come in,
[31:13.140 --> 31:15.740]  I'm going to move the store down to the first floor.
[31:15.740 --> 31:17.420]  And we went to the second story first.
[31:17.420 --> 31:18.700]  We moved, we cleaned out an area
[31:18.700 --> 31:19.680]  and went to the second story
[31:19.680 --> 31:21.220]  so that you could come into the first door
[31:21.220 --> 31:22.580]  on the bottom story.
[31:22.580 --> 31:24.500]  And it would be a little office area and we'd greet you.
[31:24.500 --> 31:25.940]  And then we'd take you up to the second floor
[31:25.940 --> 31:26.780]  and sell you buds.
[31:26.780 --> 31:28.500]  We did that for a little while.
[31:28.500 --> 31:30.500]  And then I just kept getting braver and ballsy.
[31:30.500 --> 31:31.900]  I was like, we got to move this down
[31:32.380 --> 31:34.180]  to the first floor where the handicap people can come.
[31:34.180 --> 31:35.860]  It's a medical marijuana dispensary.
[31:35.860 --> 31:37.980]  So we moved it to the first floor.
[31:37.980 --> 31:40.140]  And the owner was really excited about what I was doing.
[31:40.140 --> 31:41.460]  He's like, I love that you got balls.
[31:41.460 --> 31:43.100]  He's like, I love that you can help the customers.
[31:43.100 --> 31:44.420]  He's like, I love the way you deal with things.
[31:44.420 --> 31:46.180]  You know about cannabis, you can grow.
[31:46.180 --> 31:48.320]  So he gave me a full-time position.
[31:49.600 --> 31:52.680]  And eventually the guy that hired me
[31:52.680 --> 31:55.380]  ended up moving on to open his own business.
[31:55.380 --> 31:56.780]  He wanted to open his own dispensary
[31:56.780 --> 31:59.880]  because he learned how to run it pretty much.
[31:59.880 --> 32:01.100]  He saw everything he needed to do.
[32:01.140 --> 32:02.540]  He had a dream of opening his own shop.
[32:02.540 --> 32:04.340]  He didn't want to work for my friend, Tom.
[32:04.340 --> 32:06.660]  Shout out to Tom Sexton and Karen Garnett.
[32:06.660 --> 32:08.840]  They're the ones who gave me a shot.
[32:08.840 --> 32:10.180]  Other than Richard, under Richard.
[32:10.180 --> 32:12.500]  Richard is the one that kind of told them to hire me,
[32:12.500 --> 32:14.500]  but then they trusted me with their shop and gave me a shot.
[32:14.500 --> 32:16.380]  So one day Richard left.
[32:16.380 --> 32:17.740]  There's a whole nother story on that.
[32:17.740 --> 32:20.060]  If you guys know me, you know that story there.
[32:20.060 --> 32:21.880]  And I'm not ever going to tell that on a podcast.
[32:21.880 --> 32:24.180]  But so Richard left one day.
[32:24.180 --> 32:26.460]  Tom and Karen came over to try to run the store.
[32:26.460 --> 32:28.540]  I pretty much had the store under control.
[32:28.540 --> 32:29.620]  I knew what I was doing.
[32:29.620 --> 32:31.700]  I knew all of our customers by first names.
[32:31.700 --> 32:33.980]  I had a young lady by the name of Tree.
[32:33.980 --> 32:34.820]  Shout out Tree.
[32:34.820 --> 32:35.660]  I don't know if you ever listened to this show,
[32:35.660 --> 32:36.540]  but I hope you do.
[32:36.540 --> 32:38.420]  There's a beautiful young lady named Tree
[32:38.420 --> 32:39.540]  who ran the front desk.
[32:39.540 --> 32:40.740]  And also for a short time,
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.060]  there was a young lady named Chrisanne.
[32:42.060 --> 32:43.180]  I hope you hear this, Chrisanne.
[32:43.180 --> 32:44.020]  I miss you.
[32:44.020 --> 32:45.180]  And I really hope we get to hang out
[32:45.180 --> 32:47.100]  and play some music sometime.
[32:47.100 --> 32:48.460]  Loved both of those ladies.
[32:48.460 --> 32:50.860]  But they were kind of my door girl, my door lady,
[32:50.860 --> 32:52.780]  my greeters, my, what do you call it?
[32:52.780 --> 32:53.700]  Receptionist kind of lady.
[32:53.700 --> 32:54.520]  They weren't mine.
[32:54.520 --> 32:56.500]  They were the, the shop's receptionist kind of person.
[32:56.500 --> 32:58.220]  They would check people in when they got there.
[32:58.220 --> 32:59.100]  They'd be like, hey, what's your name?
[33:00.100 --> 33:00.940]  Do you want a card?
[33:00.940 --> 33:01.940]  Cool, we'll put you in line.
[33:01.940 --> 33:03.020]  And then they'd send them back to me.
[33:03.020 --> 33:06.500]  They'd be like, Jeff, your patient Bill is heading back.
[33:06.500 --> 33:08.740]  So they'd come back and see me.
[33:08.740 --> 33:11.260]  The owner that originally owned the place
[33:11.260 --> 33:12.980]  would show up every day.
[33:12.980 --> 33:14.220]  And I'm kind of a systems guy.
[33:14.220 --> 33:15.860]  I make like systems and procedures.
[33:15.860 --> 33:16.940]  When you're running a dispensary,
[33:16.940 --> 33:18.500]  you've got to have like procedures
[33:18.500 --> 33:21.180]  in the way that shit flows or shit doesn't flow properly,
[33:21.180 --> 33:22.900]  just like any real business needs.
[33:22.900 --> 33:25.220]  So I would set up procedures and systems
[33:25.220 --> 33:27.500]  and nothing against my friend, Tom, who owned the place,
[33:27.500 --> 33:30.060]  but he's an old Southern boy from North Carolina.
[33:30.060 --> 33:33.340]  And he doesn't believe in any sort of systems or order
[33:33.340 --> 33:36.220]  or putting things here or doing things this way.
[33:36.220 --> 33:37.700]  He just wants to smoke a joint
[33:37.700 --> 33:40.620]  and let things happen the way they do, which is beautiful,
[33:40.620 --> 33:42.060]  but it doesn't work for business.
[33:42.060 --> 33:44.540]  So one day I had to get the balls and I had to say,
[33:44.540 --> 33:47.300]  hey, Tom, the best thing for your business right now
[33:47.300 --> 33:48.660]  would be for you to go on the mountain
[33:48.660 --> 33:49.740]  and grow the weed that you grow
[33:49.740 --> 33:51.420]  and bring that weed back to the dispensary
[33:51.420 --> 33:53.900]  and let me sell it and you get the hell out of here.
[33:53.900 --> 33:54.940]  And he's like, you really think so?
[33:54.940 --> 33:55.780]  And I was like, I love you,
[33:55.780 --> 33:56.900]  but you don't know how to run a business, dude.
[33:57.300 --> 33:58.140]  You're kind of a train wreck
[33:58.140 --> 33:59.420]  when it comes to a retail establishment.
[33:59.420 --> 34:00.700]  And he took it very well.
[34:00.700 --> 34:02.100]  So he handed me the keys and he said,
[34:02.100 --> 34:03.580]  young man, you got yourself a dispensary,
[34:03.580 --> 34:04.420]  don't do me wrong.
[34:04.420 --> 34:07.380]  And he left and he let me run that dispensary.
[34:07.380 --> 34:09.060]  We ran that for quite a while.
[34:09.060 --> 34:11.500]  That's how I met our friend, White Mike,
[34:11.500 --> 34:13.300]  that comes on the podcast here.
[34:13.300 --> 34:14.360]  I met Mike there.
[34:14.360 --> 34:15.540]  I hired Mike.
[34:15.540 --> 34:18.020]  Mike was the first person I ever hired.
[34:18.020 --> 34:20.060]  The first time I ever hired anybody as an employee,
[34:20.060 --> 34:20.900]  it was Mike.
[34:20.900 --> 34:23.060]  I hired Mike to work as a backup bud tender
[34:23.060 --> 34:26.460]  at Metamore Ministries Dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[34:27.300 --> 34:28.140]  That's how we met.
[34:28.900 --> 34:30.060]  So I hired a few people.
[34:30.060 --> 34:31.780]  The shop got huge.
[34:31.780 --> 34:33.500]  We were the only shop in town.
[34:33.500 --> 34:34.820]  We were the most popular shop
[34:34.820 --> 34:37.180]  in this part of Colorado for a little while.
[34:37.180 --> 34:38.520]  We hired a couple more employees.
[34:38.520 --> 34:40.040]  We hired several more employees.
[34:40.040 --> 34:43.460]  We had Jordan and Andrea as backup bud tenders
[34:43.460 --> 34:45.580]  and computer people and managers.
[34:45.580 --> 34:47.580]  But anyway, I'm kind of getting sidetracked here
[34:47.580 --> 34:48.460]  talking about Metamore.
[34:48.460 --> 34:50.260]  I'm reminiscing in my own head.
[34:50.260 --> 34:53.460]  One day, a city manager and a police officer came in
[34:53.460 --> 34:55.260]  and handed us a cease and desist letter
[34:55.260 --> 34:57.540]  that said we could no longer serve cannabis
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.340]  out of that location.
[34:59.340 --> 35:01.820]  So we pretty much, all of the patients
[35:01.820 --> 35:04.280]  that were in the store, we gave them most of the product
[35:04.280 --> 35:06.020]  that was on the shelf because we were now closed.
[35:06.020 --> 35:07.780]  There was nothing we could do with it.
[35:07.780 --> 35:09.760]  I remember I picked a jar of sour diesel.
[35:09.760 --> 35:11.300]  Mike picked a jar of chocolate chunk.
[35:11.300 --> 35:12.740]  Jordan picked a jar of what he liked
[35:12.740 --> 35:14.260]  and Andrea picked a jar of what he liked.
[35:14.260 --> 35:15.180]  And we took those jars.
[35:15.180 --> 35:17.020]  The boss was like, go get a jar, do whatever you want.
[35:17.020 --> 35:18.340]  I don't care what happens to the product.
[35:18.340 --> 35:19.300]  We're closed.
[35:19.300 --> 35:20.540]  You can have the shit.
[35:20.540 --> 35:22.660]  So the owner gave us the product.
[35:22.660 --> 35:25.220]  We gave most of the edibles and all that perishable stuff
[35:26.180 --> 35:27.700]  to all the people that, so when the cop came in,
[35:27.700 --> 35:28.780]  a bunch of people just left.
[35:28.780 --> 35:30.780]  They're like, fuck this, and they got out of there.
[35:30.780 --> 35:31.900]  But the people that stuck around,
[35:31.900 --> 35:32.980]  they got a lot of free products.
[35:32.980 --> 35:34.460]  So we just gave all that shit away.
[35:34.460 --> 35:37.020]  And then Medimar was officially closed.
[35:37.020 --> 35:39.540]  That was the end of that era, I guess.
[35:39.540 --> 35:41.780]  And that was my jumpstart into the industry.
[35:41.780 --> 35:44.180]  I'm gonna take a quick drink of this frosty cold Dr. Pepper
[35:44.180 --> 35:45.500]  and I'll tell you the rest.
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.600]  While I'm drinking Dr. Pepper,
[35:50.600 --> 35:52.960]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my buddy, John Hunt.
[35:52.960 --> 35:54.320]  Much respect, much love.
[35:54.320 --> 35:56.720]  John Hunt is trying to quit drinking Dr. Pepper.
[35:57.600 --> 35:58.760]  I don't know why somebody would wanna do
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.120]  such a thing to themselves.
[36:02.200 --> 36:03.760]  All right, I'm better, I'm back.
[36:03.760 --> 36:05.880]  Okay, so Medimar ends up closing, right?
[36:06.840 --> 36:09.520]  Everybody in this town knew who I was from Medimar.
[36:09.520 --> 36:11.000]  Everybody knew that I was in the weed game,
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.880]  that I was growing weed, that I had all the weed available.
[36:13.880 --> 36:15.520]  So everybody started calling my phone.
[36:15.520 --> 36:16.840]  They're like, hey, the store is closed.
[36:16.840 --> 36:18.240]  Where can we get some herb?
[36:19.080 --> 36:21.640]  I was still doing, I had what's called a caregiver grow.
[36:21.640 --> 36:23.320]  The whole time I was working at Medimar,
[36:23.320 --> 36:24.960]  I was acting as a caregiver.
[36:25.200 --> 36:27.440]  I had a personal home grow.
[36:27.440 --> 36:29.160]  It was completely legal and compliant
[36:29.160 --> 36:30.160]  with the state of Colorado
[36:30.160 --> 36:32.680]  because I was a private registered caregiver
[36:32.680 --> 36:35.480]  for five other medical marijuana patients and myself,
[36:35.480 --> 36:37.000]  which meant that I was allowed to grow plants
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.960]  for myself and them.
[36:38.960 --> 36:41.460]  So I was growing product for myself and my patients,
[36:41.460 --> 36:43.840]  but a lot of these people were trying to get it from me.
[36:43.840 --> 36:46.080]  So there were a select few that honestly,
[36:46.080 --> 36:48.240]  I sold the shit out of some weed to those guys.
[36:48.240 --> 36:50.120]  But I don't do that anymore, so I can talk about it.
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.120]  But what I really ended up doing was I was caregiving
[36:53.120 --> 36:55.000]  and I was consulting and teaching people
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.800]  how to be a better caregiver.
[36:56.800 --> 36:59.800]  So I would go, if you didn't know how to grow weed yet,
[36:59.800 --> 37:02.200]  I'd go to your house and I'd help you set up your grow.
[37:02.200 --> 37:03.720]  I'd figure out how much herb you need to grow,
[37:03.720 --> 37:04.680]  how much space you've got.
[37:04.680 --> 37:07.760]  We'd set you up and then I would either get a fee up front
[37:07.760 --> 37:09.680]  or I would get a portion of your harvest.
[37:09.680 --> 37:11.560]  So that's kind of how I stayed afloat there
[37:11.560 --> 37:14.060]  and kept myself real popular into this cannabis industry
[37:14.060 --> 37:16.180]  around here, that and caregiving.
[37:17.080 --> 37:18.760]  As soon as I saw Medimar start,
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.600]  I'd been breeding seeds and crossing plants a little bit.
[37:23.400 --> 37:26.360]  A little bit before now, before this time.
[37:26.360 --> 37:27.560]  But when Medimar went down,
[37:27.560 --> 37:29.880]  I realized that I needed something solid
[37:29.880 --> 37:32.220]  because the consulting thing was great,
[37:32.220 --> 37:33.440]  but it's unreliable.
[37:33.440 --> 37:35.760]  People around here, they say they're gonna pay
[37:35.760 --> 37:37.960]  and a lot of times they kind of don't wanna pay.
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.920]  So I started breeding seeds for retail distribution
[37:41.920 --> 37:43.520]  and that's how iRegenetics came up.
[37:43.520 --> 37:44.960]  I was posting pictures online,
[37:44.960 --> 37:47.200]  people were loving my cannabis pictures.
[37:47.200 --> 37:50.480]  I decided to make an iRegenetics Facebook page
[37:50.480 --> 37:53.080]  and then iRegenetics really exploded.
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.280]  I began vending my seeds to a,
[37:56.280 --> 37:58.000]  or distributing my seeds to a vendor
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.840]  known as naturesgreenremedies.com.
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.280]  They are now known as thedankteam.com.
[38:02.280 --> 38:04.080]  They might have a little bit of my products
[38:04.080 --> 38:05.080]  available right now, you guys.
[38:05.080 --> 38:07.400]  If you check them out, thedankteam.com,
[38:07.400 --> 38:09.340]  you may be able to get some iRegenetics seeds from there.
[38:09.340 --> 38:11.220]  So I started putting my seeds out.
[38:11.220 --> 38:13.640]  I went to a few cannabis cups and hustled.
[38:13.640 --> 38:14.480]  Millions of seeds.
[38:14.480 --> 38:16.960]  I've gotten millions of seeds out into the planet now
[38:16.960 --> 38:20.020]  that are my fault, that I've given away and or sold.
[38:20.020 --> 38:23.380]  So I was noticing that I was getting a little stagnant.
[38:23.380 --> 38:24.580]  Honestly, I had the podcast.
[38:24.580 --> 38:26.860]  After the seed company got going,
[38:26.860 --> 38:28.980]  I started doing a podcast with my friend, Wade.
[38:28.980 --> 38:31.180]  We had a podcast called 719 The Blocks.
[38:31.180 --> 38:34.620]  It is now defunct, but he was doing a podcast.
[38:34.620 --> 38:35.780]  One night I went to a comedy show
[38:35.780 --> 38:38.460]  and he wanted to do a podcast after the comedy show
[38:38.460 --> 38:39.580]  and he didn't have anywhere to do it.
[38:39.580 --> 38:41.860]  And I've got this sweet table and I was like,
[38:41.860 --> 38:44.120]  let's go to my house and record, it'll be fun.
[38:44.120 --> 38:46.020]  So I did a podcast with Wade
[38:46.020 --> 38:49.020]  and I honestly fell in love with podcasting
[38:49.020 --> 38:51.900]  because of that, but I did not like the equipment
[38:51.900 --> 38:53.400]  that Wade had and I didn't approve
[38:53.400 --> 38:55.740]  of the quality production that Wade was doing.
[38:55.740 --> 38:58.160]  And so I kind of volunteered to help Wade
[38:58.160 --> 39:01.060]  get his show up to par and I bought some recording.
[39:01.060 --> 39:02.020]  I already had some equipment
[39:02.020 --> 39:03.060]  because I'm a drummer and a musician,
[39:03.060 --> 39:05.780]  but I bought a couple other add-ons for my equipment.
[39:05.780 --> 39:08.240]  Bought a interface to make it work with my MacBook.
[39:08.240 --> 39:11.620]  Started podcasting, fell in love with podcasting with Wade.
[39:11.620 --> 39:13.860]  We did a couple episodes that featured cannabis
[39:13.860 --> 39:16.180]  and then he got tired of hearing about weed on his show.
[39:16.180 --> 39:19.260]  So I made my own cannabis spinoff
[39:19.260 --> 39:21.680]  and we're here now at 112 episodes.
[39:21.680 --> 39:24.060]  Holy crap, thank you guys for listening to me rant this long
[39:24.060 --> 39:26.500]  and for listening to 112 episodes.
[39:26.500 --> 39:27.760]  So I started podcasting.
[39:29.540 --> 39:31.420]  Then there were a bunch of dispensaries opening up
[39:31.420 --> 39:33.700]  in my area and I was watching a lot of my friends
[39:33.700 --> 39:36.800]  in my age group get really cool jobs at dispensaries.
[39:36.800 --> 39:38.000]  And it just kind of looked like fun.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.480]  I missed the metamor days, I missed having coworkers.
[39:40.480 --> 39:43.620]  I was working from home and private facilities
[39:43.620 --> 39:45.180]  and I wasn't having the interactions
[39:45.180 --> 39:48.700]  with the social interactions that I missed, that I desired.
[39:48.700 --> 39:50.980]  So my buddy Kevin, our old friend Kevin
[39:50.980 --> 39:51.820]  that used to be on the show,
[39:51.820 --> 39:53.440]  he worked at the spa dispensary
[39:53.440 --> 39:55.140]  and he kept putting in good words for me
[39:55.140 --> 39:56.480]  and saying that they should hit me up
[39:56.480 --> 39:57.540]  and have me be their grower
[39:57.540 --> 40:00.500]  because they were having issues with their master grower.
[40:00.500 --> 40:03.580]  So I kept putting that off and putting that off.
[40:03.580 --> 40:07.420]  And then I decided I started dating a girl named Angela
[40:07.420 --> 40:08.900]  and Angela got a job at the spa
[40:08.900 --> 40:10.500]  and talked about how much fun it was.
[40:10.500 --> 40:12.220]  And so they would have functions.
[40:13.220 --> 40:14.060]  What's his name?
[40:14.060 --> 40:17.220]  Afro man came out to the spa and we got to meet Afro man.
[40:17.220 --> 40:19.420]  They did a few other things that I went to
[40:19.420 --> 40:21.180]  as a guest with Angela and I hung out
[40:21.180 --> 40:22.900]  and the spa crew was a bunch of fun people.
[40:22.900 --> 40:24.300]  I had a good time with them.
[40:25.140 --> 40:26.660]  We're all dirty minded dudes
[40:26.660 --> 40:28.500]  and I had a really good time with Rob
[40:28.500 --> 40:30.380]  and with Dave and with Vegas and with the whole crew.
[40:30.380 --> 40:32.740]  I really got along with everybody.
[40:32.740 --> 40:34.780]  So one day Angela said,
[40:34.780 --> 40:37.460]  hey, they want you to come in and talk about a job.
[40:37.460 --> 40:39.020]  So I walked into the spa dispensary
[40:39.020 --> 40:39.940]  and they're like, who are you?
[40:39.940 --> 40:40.780]  What do you do?
[40:40.780 --> 40:41.600]  And I was like, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[40:42.120 --> 40:42.960]  I'm the owner of IRI Genetics.
[40:42.960 --> 40:43.780]  I've been growing for this long.
[40:43.780 --> 40:45.160]  I've been breeding for this long.
[40:45.160 --> 40:48.000]  I helped found the only dispensary
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.880]  in the city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[40:49.880 --> 40:51.680]  We've got a podcast with this many listeners.
[40:51.680 --> 40:53.520]  I had at the time an Instagram following
[40:53.520 --> 40:56.120]  of like 15,000 followers, which has been deleted.
[40:57.060 --> 40:59.400]  So I just threw down who I was and what I did.
[40:59.400 --> 41:00.520]  And they looked me straight in the face
[41:00.520 --> 41:02.280]  and they said, can you grow hydro?
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.120]  And I told them, you know,
[41:03.120 --> 41:05.160]  I have very, very little hydro experience,
[41:05.160 --> 41:06.280]  but I'm pretty sure I can learn it
[41:06.280 --> 41:08.740]  because it's a cannabis plant and I can learn anything.
[41:08.740 --> 41:10.320]  And they looked at each other like they were impressed
[41:10.320 --> 41:11.160]  and they shook my hand
[41:11.680 --> 41:12.600]  and they said, how much money do you want to make?
[41:12.600 --> 41:15.100]  And I told them and they said, okay.
[41:15.100 --> 41:16.700]  And I kicked myself in the ass
[41:16.700 --> 41:18.040]  because I should have shot a lot higher
[41:18.040 --> 41:19.120]  since they didn't budge at all.
[41:19.120 --> 41:20.880]  They were like, okay, we'll pay you that.
[41:20.880 --> 41:23.200]  And so that's how I got into the spot.
[41:23.200 --> 41:25.320]  I basically, they knew who I was
[41:25.320 --> 41:27.360]  from my buddy, Kevin hyping them up.
[41:27.360 --> 41:29.400]  And then Angela told me that they were talking to her
[41:29.400 --> 41:31.560]  and that I should go in there and hit them up for a job.
[41:31.560 --> 41:34.120]  So I went in there and they gave me a job on the spot.
[41:34.120 --> 41:35.920]  So shout out to Kevin, shout out to Angela
[41:35.920 --> 41:37.080]  and shout out to the whole spot crew.
[41:37.080 --> 41:38.160]  Even though I'm not there anymore,
[41:38.160 --> 41:39.800]  I have no ill will toward the spot.
[41:39.800 --> 41:42.020]  It's just not my spot for me.
[41:42.020 --> 41:44.160]  They didn't have any plants and I need to grow plants.
[41:44.160 --> 41:46.440]  So that puts me into the next phase
[41:46.440 --> 41:47.640]  of how I got into the industry
[41:47.640 --> 41:50.120]  or where I am now in the industry, I guess.
[41:50.120 --> 41:51.880]  I worked at the spot for quite a while.
[41:51.880 --> 41:54.820]  They were having issues getting their grow rooms
[41:54.820 --> 41:56.840]  up and running and up to par.
[41:56.840 --> 41:58.960]  And I was struggling to find something
[41:58.960 --> 42:00.960]  to keep myself busy with for 40 hours.
[42:00.960 --> 42:01.880]  And I was on salary.
[42:01.880 --> 42:04.200]  So I was expected to be doing something.
[42:04.200 --> 42:05.640]  I caught myself cleaning dog shit
[42:05.640 --> 42:06.680]  in the parking lot one time.
[42:06.680 --> 42:08.640]  And I thought about it and I was like,
[42:08.640 --> 42:10.040]  not to be conceited, but I was like,
[42:10.040 --> 42:12.520]  I'm a master grower and I'm pretty sure I make
[42:12.520 --> 42:14.240]  one of the top salaries in the building.
[42:14.240 --> 42:16.120]  Why am I out here picking up dog shit
[42:16.120 --> 42:17.700]  and not growing cannabis?
[42:18.720 --> 42:21.040]  And that really started to like eat at me.
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.000]  I was like, I'm doing things like sweeping up dead bugs
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.820]  and fixing, hanging shelves in the bud room.
[42:26.820 --> 42:29.480]  I was like, I'm not here to be fucking Felix Fix-It
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.120]  or Fix-It Felix from Wreck-It Ralph, bro.
[42:31.120 --> 42:32.280]  That's not my duty.
[42:32.280 --> 42:33.840]  I'm kind of a cannabis grower.
[42:33.840 --> 42:37.400]  So one day I was at work and our good friend Hunt
[42:37.400 --> 42:39.920]  from Green and Healthy Wellness sent me a text message.
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.380]  And it said, give me a call as soon as you can.
[42:42.380 --> 42:44.600]  And Hunt doesn't really send out the SOS like that.
[42:44.600 --> 42:45.680]  Usually it's like, what's up, bro?
[42:45.680 --> 42:46.800]  Let's take dabs and you're free.
[42:46.800 --> 42:48.680]  But he said, as soon as you can.
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.200]  So since I wasn't doing a damn thing at the spot anyway,
[42:52.200 --> 42:53.680]  I pulled out my phone and I gave him a call.
[42:53.680 --> 42:54.520]  I was like, what's up brother?
[42:54.520 --> 42:57.840]  And he was like, hey, there was an issue with my grower here
[42:57.840 --> 43:01.040]  and he no longer is employed and I need a master grower.
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.840]  And I was like, he actually was calling to ask
[43:03.840 --> 43:07.340]  if I had a partner or a minion that worked in my grows
[43:08.280 --> 43:09.580]  that I would donate to him so that he could have somebody
[43:09.580 --> 43:11.020]  to work his grows.
[43:11.020 --> 43:13.600]  And I said, you know what, Hunt, I want that job.
[43:13.600 --> 43:16.460]  And we agreed on a wage and a starting date.
[43:16.460 --> 43:19.320]  And about six weeks ago, it feels like,
[43:19.320 --> 43:21.580]  I took over as the lead cultivator
[43:21.580 --> 43:22.820]  at Green and Healthy Wellness
[43:22.820 --> 43:24.940]  in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[43:24.940 --> 43:26.540]  Right now the retail store,
[43:26.540 --> 43:28.100]  you know what, by the time this episode comes out,
[43:28.100 --> 43:30.140]  we'll be just a few days away
[43:30.140 --> 43:32.180]  from the retail location opening.
[43:32.180 --> 43:35.340]  The new location is on 430 West Colorado Avenue
[43:35.340 --> 43:36.380]  in Colorado Springs.
[43:36.380 --> 43:37.880]  It's the old gas station.
[43:37.880 --> 43:39.840]  We call it the Terp Station now.
[43:39.840 --> 43:41.420]  We've got some art in there.
[43:41.420 --> 43:42.980]  We had a professional artist come
[43:42.980 --> 43:45.180]  and do some beautiful art on the inside.
[43:45.180 --> 43:47.020]  The building is looking really great.
[43:47.020 --> 43:48.620]  There's a lot of parking.
[43:48.620 --> 43:51.700]  We will have a bunch of great product.
[43:51.700 --> 43:55.100]  Around February 1st, we will be harvesting the first round
[43:55.100 --> 43:58.220]  of Green and Healthy Wellness medicine grown by myself.
[43:58.220 --> 44:00.300]  Rasta Jeff put this into flower.
[44:00.300 --> 44:01.980]  I've been taking good care of it.
[44:01.980 --> 44:03.340]  So it'll be ready pretty soon.
[44:03.340 --> 44:05.020]  But that's where I am now in the industry, you guys.
[44:05.020 --> 44:06.740]  That's pretty much how I got in the industry,
[44:06.740 --> 44:09.420]  and that's where I am today in the industry.
[44:09.420 --> 44:10.440]  I still breed seeds.
[44:10.440 --> 44:12.780]  My next breeding project will probably be making
[44:12.780 --> 44:15.620]  an F2 version of the strain Arise.
[44:15.620 --> 44:19.220]  I will also add about four or five other females
[44:19.220 --> 44:20.900]  into that selection.
[44:20.900 --> 44:22.820]  So there will be some Arise F2s
[44:22.820 --> 44:24.940]  and then a couple of Arise crosses
[44:24.940 --> 44:27.400]  that come out of iReed Genetics in the near future.
[44:27.400 --> 44:29.280]  I do intend to keep this podcast going
[44:29.280 --> 44:30.940]  as long as people will listen.
[44:30.940 --> 44:33.400]  I know lately it's been a little bit unprepared,
[44:33.400 --> 44:35.080]  but that's because I'm working a lot of hours
[44:35.080 --> 44:36.100]  at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[44:36.100 --> 44:37.880]  getting things put together there.
[44:37.880 --> 44:39.940]  I'm definitely adjusting to my new schedule.
[44:39.940 --> 44:41.340]  I'm getting everything back in order.
[44:41.340 --> 44:44.220]  So the shows are gonna get back to what they used to be.
[44:44.220 --> 44:45.540]  I said that after episode 100,
[44:45.540 --> 44:46.900]  we'd get back into the grow lessons,
[44:46.900 --> 44:48.540]  and I've been doing it a little bit.
[44:48.540 --> 44:49.400]  It's the holiday season.
[44:49.400 --> 44:51.180]  So this episode and the one next week
[44:51.180 --> 44:52.780]  are just gonna be me ranting about stuff.
[44:52.780 --> 44:55.580]  I think next week, I'm going to talk a little bit
[44:55.580 --> 44:57.140]  about what I do in the grow room.
[44:57.140 --> 44:59.020]  I'm just gonna kinda take you guys
[44:59.020 --> 45:00.140]  to the grow room with me.
[45:00.140 --> 45:00.980]  We'll walk into the grow.
[45:00.980 --> 45:02.420]  We'll talk about my chores that I do,
[45:02.440 --> 45:03.320]  the things that I check.
[45:03.320 --> 45:06.640]  We'll talk about my personal grow and a small home grow,
[45:06.640 --> 45:08.360]  and we'll talk about the large-scale grow
[45:08.360 --> 45:09.440]  at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[45:09.440 --> 45:11.560]  I'll try to talk about both of those.
[45:11.560 --> 45:14.360]  I also wanna do a checklist of things
[45:14.360 --> 45:16.320]  that you guys should be doing
[45:16.320 --> 45:18.880]  on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
[45:18.880 --> 45:21.920]  So those will probably be the next two episodes.
[45:21.920 --> 45:24.160]  Anyway, I feel like I'm rambling on and on and on.
[45:24.160 --> 45:27.040]  I'll keep this podcast going is what I was saying.
[45:27.040 --> 45:28.400]  I'm gonna keep breeding seeds.
[45:28.400 --> 45:30.860]  iReed Genetics will continue to come out with new seeds.
[45:30.860 --> 45:33.680]  I will keep breeding my new stuff to my old stuff,
[45:33.680 --> 45:36.400]  plus the newest crosses that I find that I really like
[45:36.400 --> 45:38.240]  will be bred into my lines.
[45:38.240 --> 45:39.240]  I'm gonna keep that going.
[45:39.240 --> 45:41.180]  I will keep the podcast going.
[45:41.180 --> 45:43.480]  I will be at the Cannabis Cup for most of the days.
[45:43.480 --> 45:45.480]  If you guys are coming to the Denver Cannabis Cup
[45:45.480 --> 45:47.160]  over the 420 weekend,
[45:47.160 --> 45:49.400]  I will try to be there Saturday and Sunday,
[45:49.400 --> 45:51.000]  and of course, I will do my best
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.240]  to make an appearance for 420.
[45:53.240 --> 45:54.240]  Cannot promise you anything
[45:54.240 --> 45:56.860]  with the way the Green and Healthy Wellness garden goes.
[45:56.860 --> 45:58.920]  That is a lot of work for myself,
[45:58.940 --> 46:01.820]  but I love every single minute of it.
[46:01.820 --> 46:03.840]  You guys, there will be some collaborations coming up
[46:03.840 --> 46:04.820]  in the very near future.
[46:04.820 --> 46:06.260]  I will be breeding some strains
[46:06.260 --> 46:08.220]  with some other well-known breeders.
[46:08.220 --> 46:10.580]  I will be also creating strains
[46:10.580 --> 46:14.140]  for some people who I can't even talk about right now,
[46:14.140 --> 46:16.160]  people that you know their names,
[46:16.160 --> 46:17.740]  you might listen to their music,
[46:17.740 --> 46:20.660]  you might watch their videos.
[46:20.660 --> 46:22.800]  There are things that you might do
[46:22.800 --> 46:24.060]  that we can't even talk about right now,
[46:24.060 --> 46:25.580]  but there's some cool shit coming up in the future.
[46:25.580 --> 46:27.180]  So you guys, I feel like I've rambled
[46:27.200 --> 46:29.200]  for a good 45 minutes now.
[46:29.200 --> 46:30.800]  Wow, I just looked at the time.
[46:30.800 --> 46:31.920]  This is gonna be a long episode.
[46:31.920 --> 46:33.560]  I appreciate everybody for listening to it.
[46:33.560 --> 46:35.280]  That's where I came from in the industry,
[46:35.280 --> 46:36.980]  and that's where I am now, you guys.

[47:01.460 --> 47:03.260]  or we're gonna walk through my ganja garden
[47:03.260 --> 47:04.680]  and talk about my chores.
[47:04.680 --> 47:07.780]  Maybe we'll combine that into one long-ass episode.
