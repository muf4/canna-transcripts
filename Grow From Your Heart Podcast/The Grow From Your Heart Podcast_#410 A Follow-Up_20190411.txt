[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.080 --> 00:05.660]  It's time for episode 410 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.660 --> 00:09.060]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.060 --> 00:13.400]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:13.400 --> 00:19.640]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:19.640 --> 00:23.440]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I've been dabbing.
[00:23.440 --> 00:28.320]  Today I've been smoking on the Mai Tai Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[00:28.320 --> 00:31.360]  This is a cross of the Sunset Sherb and Purple Punch.
[00:31.360 --> 00:35.320]  On the package, the flavor is described as tropical fruit cocktail.
[00:35.320 --> 00:37.760]  I would totally agree with the tropical fruit cocktail.
[00:37.760 --> 00:41.880]  There's also something real Jolly Rancher and kind of sweet candy flavored in there.
[00:41.880 --> 00:46.680]  It really sticks around on your mouth for a long time, and it makes the room smell amazing.
[00:46.680 --> 00:50.720]  After you smoke some dabs, I left the room, I came back, and it smelled amazing in here.
[00:50.720 --> 00:54.960]  So I'm really enjoying the Mai Tai Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[00:54.960 --> 01:00.840]  On the back, it says it contains 65.41% total THC.
[01:00.840 --> 01:04.720]  Alright Podcast World, I am recording on a cold April evening.
[01:04.720 --> 01:09.260]  If you hear some smacking noises or some weird random noises in the background, that is because
[01:09.260 --> 01:15.000]  we are currently experiencing a windstorm that is including small bursts of hail.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  So if you hear weird noises in the background, hopefully that is just the wind and the hail
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  beating against the side of my house.
[01:22.040 --> 01:25.960]  I really hope all of this weather passes and clears up quickly because this weekend is
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.600]  the weekend of the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.240]  That's right, it cultivated synergy on April 13th.
[01:31.240 --> 01:34.800]  I will be attending and vending at the Dude Grows Cup in Denver.
[01:34.800 --> 01:36.520]  I look forward to seeing everybody there.
[01:36.520 --> 01:37.800]  Come say hi.
[01:37.800 --> 01:40.640]  By the time this comes out, it will be really close to cup time.
[01:40.640 --> 01:43.520]  If you are interested in attending the cup, send me an email.
[01:43.520 --> 01:46.680]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:46.680 --> 01:50.960]  I will forward your information to the Dude, and the Dude will get you all of the information
[01:50.960 --> 01:54.160]  you need to either enter or attend the cup.
[01:54.160 --> 01:55.880]  I do encourage you to enter.
[01:55.880 --> 01:57.760]  They are accepting 50 entries.
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.760]  At last count, there were about 40.
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.080]  So there still may be room by the time this episode comes out.
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.240]  Once again, if you're interested in attending or entering the Dude Grows Cup at the last
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.240]  minute, send me an email.
[02:09.240 --> 02:10.880]  I will see if it is still an option.
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.520]  I will forward your contact info to the Dude, and the Dude will get in touch with you.
[02:15.520 --> 02:21.400]  I will also have the debut of the blue raspberry truffles at the Dude Grows Cup.
[02:21.400 --> 02:24.040]  It will be the first few packs available at that event.
[02:24.040 --> 02:25.040]  So come say hi.
[02:25.040 --> 02:26.040]  All right.
[02:26.040 --> 02:29.500]  I do have a lot to talk about in this episode, but before we get to it, I would like to do
[02:29.500 --> 02:31.280]  a few shout outs from Patreon.
[02:31.280 --> 02:33.800]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend Joseph G.
[02:33.800 --> 02:34.800]  A big shout out to BAFSTA.
[02:34.800 --> 02:37.480]  How about a big shout out to Eric Ross?
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.440]  I owe a big thank you to Glenn Jerome.
[02:39.440 --> 02:42.040]  A giant Ross to fist bump to Remy Redeye.
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.440]  And a big grow from your heart thank you to my friend Full Monty.
[02:46.440 --> 02:47.680]  All right, podcast world.
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.520]  A few episodes back, I talked about using CO2 in your garden, and somebody asked if
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.780]  I recommended or suggested turning off or reducing CO2 late in flower or at some point
[02:58.780 --> 03:00.440]  in the flowering phase.
[03:00.440 --> 03:05.620]  I recommended to use CO2 throughout the entire grow cycle.
[03:05.620 --> 03:09.640]  As soon as you can start using it, start using it and use it and increase it all the way
[03:09.640 --> 03:11.120]  up to harvest time.
[03:11.200 --> 03:17.120]  I received a comment on my YouTube video from a viewer and the comment goes like this.
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.280]  They said, hey Ross to Jeff, thank you for all you do.
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.600]  I think the guy asking about stopping CO2 in flower was talking about comments from
[03:24.600 --> 03:26.100]  ocean grown seeds.
[03:26.100 --> 03:32.040]  A few of their breeders strongly recommend stopping CO2 at week six of flower to avoid
[03:32.040 --> 03:34.040]  too much leaf production.
[03:34.040 --> 03:35.040]  What are your thoughts?
[03:35.040 --> 03:36.320]  I would love to know.
[03:36.320 --> 03:38.000]  And that's from a friend on YouTube.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.160]  I don't know if they want their name said on the show.
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.200]  However, if you scroll and troll the YouTube channel long enough, you will find their comment
[03:45.200 --> 03:47.480]  and you will know who they are.
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.600]  So I am going to completely disagree with the recommendation of another breeder.
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.480]  However, I'm going to do it completely respectfully.
[03:54.480 --> 03:57.000]  I don't know the rest of their grow tactics.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.400]  We are not doing everything the same.
[03:59.400 --> 04:02.800]  We are probably doing everything completely differently.
[04:02.800 --> 04:04.360]  Growing has a lot of freedom.
[04:04.360 --> 04:05.360]  There are a lot of options.
[04:05.360 --> 04:06.360]  There are a lot of methods.
[04:06.440 --> 04:10.680]  There are a lot of techniques and tactics, and many of them will work.
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.560]  I've said before, the only way you're doing it wrong is if the plants die or if you are
[04:15.560 --> 04:17.680]  not happy with the final outcome.
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.280]  I've got nothing but love and respect for the folks over at ocean grown seeds.
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.400]  I don't know what they're doing.
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.160]  I don't know their growing method.
[04:24.160 --> 04:29.760]  It sounds like they may recommend that we stop using CO2 around week six.
[04:29.760 --> 04:32.080]  I respectfully disagree.
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.780]  They recommend to stop doing it because it produces too much leaf.
[04:35.780 --> 04:41.000]  I am known for defoliating quite heavily throughout the entire flowering process.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.400]  So creating too much leaf is not really a problem for me.
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.480]  I like to go in and defoliate.
[04:46.480 --> 04:48.480]  I really like spending time in the garden doing that.
[04:48.480 --> 04:51.100]  I've got a crew that does it in a large facility.
[04:51.100 --> 04:53.160]  So too much leaf is really not an issue for me.
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.720]  I'm defoliating anyway.
[04:54.720 --> 04:57.760]  I'm in there taking out leaves to increase light penetration.
[04:57.760 --> 05:00.220]  I'm in there taking out leaves to increase airflow.
[05:00.220 --> 05:04.160]  I'm in there taking out leaves just to minimize the amount of leaf in the room when it comes
[05:04.160 --> 05:05.360]  time to harvest.
[05:05.940 --> 05:08.220]  It helps with respiration and transpiration.
[05:08.220 --> 05:10.100]  It helps keep the VPD in line.
[05:10.100 --> 05:15.280]  I just think it's very advantageous to defoliate heavily throughout the flowering period anyway.
[05:15.280 --> 05:16.820]  So we grow differently.
[05:16.820 --> 05:18.100]  I'm not disrespecting them.
[05:18.100 --> 05:19.900]  I'm not arguing with that company.
[05:19.900 --> 05:21.580]  I'm just saying we do it differently.
[05:21.580 --> 05:22.900]  That is not how I do it.
[05:22.900 --> 05:28.280]  I feel that you may get a lot of leaf development if you're using a lot of CO2 and certain nutrients.
[05:28.280 --> 05:29.860]  I have seen that.
[05:29.860 --> 05:32.140]  Also, you get a lot of bud development.
[05:32.140 --> 05:33.220]  So I think it is worth it.
[05:33.220 --> 05:35.020]  I think it's a positive trade-off.
[05:35.040 --> 05:36.440]  I do it differently.
[05:36.440 --> 05:38.640]  I'm not disrespecting anybody again.
[05:38.640 --> 05:42.680]  I completely respect everybody's grow method as long as it is working for you.
[05:42.680 --> 05:45.040]  However, that is not the way I do it.
[05:45.040 --> 05:48.800]  So if you're following my grow method, if you're using all of my grow methods and techniques
[05:48.800 --> 05:51.880]  and lessons, I would recommend continuing the CO2.
[05:51.880 --> 05:54.440]  If you want to grow with the way the other guys taught you, do that.
[05:54.440 --> 05:56.040]  If it works for you, do that.
[05:56.040 --> 05:58.280]  Do what works for you and makes you happy.
[05:58.280 --> 06:02.080]  Or try to make a hybrid of all of the above as long as it works out.
[06:02.080 --> 06:03.080]  The plants are the boss.
[06:03.140 --> 06:06.780]  As long as the plants are happy and as long as you are happy with the final outcome, everything
[06:06.780 --> 06:07.780]  is working.
[06:07.780 --> 06:10.740]  But that other company and myself, we just do it differently.
[06:10.740 --> 06:13.660]  No hatred, no animosity, just different things.
[06:13.660 --> 06:16.180]  Like I said earlier, different bands playing different songs.
[06:16.180 --> 06:18.180]  So that's my answer to that YouTube question.
[06:18.180 --> 06:20.700]  Hey, thank you for the great YouTube question.
[06:20.700 --> 06:22.460]  I do like answering the YouTube comments.
[06:22.460 --> 06:27.580]  However, it would be easier for myself and it would probably be more beneficial for you
[06:27.580 --> 06:32.500]  and more likely to get your question answered and acknowledged if you reach out to me through
[06:32.920 --> 06:33.920]  email.
[06:33.920 --> 06:37.680]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:37.680 --> 06:39.120]  That's the best way to get a hold of me.
[06:39.120 --> 06:41.240]  I do love the YouTube comments.
[06:41.240 --> 06:42.460]  Please keep leaving those.
[06:42.460 --> 06:46.560]  But if you want something answered directly, the email is your best bet.
[06:46.560 --> 06:51.840]  Oh, and if we were having a conversation on Instagram on my irie underscore genetics account,
[06:51.840 --> 06:52.960]  I did not block you.
[06:52.960 --> 06:54.840]  I did not abandon the conversation.
[06:54.840 --> 06:56.800]  Instagram has taken down that account.
[06:56.800 --> 07:00.720]  I'm doing my best to get the account back, but I cannot make any promises.
[07:00.720 --> 07:01.960]  I do have another account.
[07:02.420 --> 07:08.420]  It is rastajeff710 on Instagram, but I haven't posted anything but a profile picture on that
[07:08.420 --> 07:09.420]  account.
[07:09.420 --> 07:10.420]  So follow me there if you'd like to.
[07:10.420 --> 07:15.260]  And in the meantime, I will try to get back the original irie underscore genetics Instagram
[07:15.260 --> 07:16.260]  account.
[07:16.260 --> 07:21.060]  All right, you guys, I would like to read some Apple podcast customer reviews on this
[07:21.060 --> 07:22.060]  episode.
[07:22.060 --> 07:23.220]  So let's jump right into it.
[07:23.220 --> 07:28.020]  If you would like to leave a review on Apple podcasts, all you have to do, most of you
[07:28.020 --> 07:31.660]  are probably using an iPhone or some sort of an Apple device.
[07:32.360 --> 07:35.360]  If you open up your podcasting app and you go to the grow from your heart podcast, I'm
[07:35.360 --> 07:37.720]  doing this right now so I can give you a really good description.
[07:37.720 --> 07:39.780]  Open up the grow from your heart podcast.
[07:39.780 --> 07:43.920]  If you look at the available episodes right under there, it says best of the podcast.
[07:43.920 --> 07:46.680]  Keep scrolling right past where it gives you best of the podcast.
[07:46.680 --> 07:48.920]  Then it comes to ratings and reviews.
[07:48.920 --> 07:52.560]  You can either click all and you can read all of the ratings and reviews or you can
[07:52.560 --> 07:53.560]  write a review.
[07:53.560 --> 07:55.480]  There's a little tab you click, write a review.
[07:55.480 --> 07:58.720]  It also gives you the option to leave an amount of stars.
[07:58.720 --> 08:00.740]  You can leave up to a five star rating.
[08:00.820 --> 08:03.200]  So far, most folks have left a five star rating.
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.600]  I'm looking on my phone so I can't see the exact amount of stars.
[08:05.600 --> 08:09.200]  It shows me that at least one or two people have left a one and a four star rating, which
[08:09.200 --> 08:10.420]  is just fine with me.
[08:10.420 --> 08:11.840]  I am not for everybody.
[08:11.840 --> 08:15.680]  I encourage you to leave the amount of stars which you feel I deserve.
[08:15.680 --> 08:20.920]  After that, type in a little comment and let everybody know what you think about the podcast.
[08:20.920 --> 08:24.240]  I'm going to read some recent reviews for the show.
[08:24.240 --> 08:25.240]  Let's start with this one.
[08:25.240 --> 08:28.340]  It comes from somebody who calls himself Darth Knight three.
[08:28.340 --> 08:30.800]  This was left on February 28th.
[08:30.800 --> 08:35.480]  The headline is, The Cannabis Content I've Been Craving and the review goes a little
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.600]  bit like this.
[08:37.600 --> 08:43.040]  I am planning my first grow and was very excited to find this show and it is no disappointment.
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.640]  Jeff paints a vivid picture and has a passion for educating people in all aspects of cannabis.
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.160]  Mike is awesome.
[08:50.160 --> 08:52.920]  He sounds kind of like Joe Rogan in my opinion.
[08:52.920 --> 08:54.160]  This show is so good.
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.900]  We just let the podcast play over the shop stereo for hours while we work.
[08:58.900 --> 09:00.540]  I love this show.
[09:00.540 --> 09:02.500]  Man, that is a great message.
[09:02.500 --> 09:05.460]  I'm glad that you found us while you're planning your first grow.
[09:05.460 --> 09:07.580]  I hope you have checked out the grow lessons.
[09:07.580 --> 09:09.340]  I hope those did you very well.
[09:09.340 --> 09:14.140]  I enjoy that you think I paint a vivid picture and I'm glad that you can see my passion for
[09:14.140 --> 09:16.180]  educating and my passion for cannabis.
[09:16.180 --> 09:17.800]  It means a lot to me.
[09:17.800 --> 09:21.980]  Cannabis means a lot and I want to dispel all of the rumors about cannabis and I want
[09:21.980 --> 09:25.000]  people to just do the best with cannabis, put it in the best light.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.960]  I'm glad that you see that and thank you for trying to do that for us.
[09:27.960 --> 09:29.600]  Do you say Mike is awesome?
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.760]  Yes, Mike is awesome.
[09:30.760 --> 09:31.760]  Mike is a cool dude.
[09:31.760 --> 09:32.760]  He's a good bro.
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.760]  He's a good father.
[09:33.760 --> 09:34.760]  He's a good husband.
[09:34.760 --> 09:35.760]  Just one bad motherfucker.
[09:35.760 --> 09:36.760]  Mike is cool.
[09:36.760 --> 09:37.760]  Thanks for being my bro, Mike.
[09:37.760 --> 09:38.760]  Thanks for noticing that.
[09:38.760 --> 09:40.200]  Then you say he sounds like Joe Rogan.
[09:40.200 --> 09:45.720]  In your opinion, you probably mean Mike because I don't think I sound like Rogan, but to have
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.440]  somebody on the show called Rogan, you got the word Rogan in there.
[09:48.440 --> 09:50.080]  That's always a compliment to us.
[09:50.080 --> 09:51.080]  Thank you for that.
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.080]  The show is so good.
[09:52.080 --> 09:54.180]  You just let it play over the shop stereo.
[09:54.180 --> 09:55.180]  That is awesome.
[09:55.180 --> 09:56.720]  I'm curious what kind of shop you've got.
[09:56.720 --> 09:57.720]  Is it a retail shop?
[09:57.720 --> 09:58.960]  Is it where you're working?
[09:58.960 --> 10:02.320]  Are there more people walking in and being exposed to the show as you're listening to
[10:02.320 --> 10:03.320]  it?
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.320]  I'm just curious.
[10:04.320 --> 10:07.060]  My mind gets curious when you say you're playing it in a public area.
[10:07.060 --> 10:10.600]  Makes me want to know who's listening, but man, I'm glad more people are being exposed.
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.040]  I'm glad you're playing it and most of all, I'm glad you love the show.
[10:14.040 --> 10:16.260]  So big thanks for listening to the show.
[10:16.260 --> 10:20.160]  Big thanks for the great review and extra big thanks for that five star rating.
[10:20.240 --> 10:22.280]  All right, I do have a few more comments.
[10:22.280 --> 10:24.040]  Let's get right to the next one.
[10:24.040 --> 10:27.480]  This next one comes from a person who calls themselves Willie's armpit.
[10:27.480 --> 10:28.480]  What's up Willie's armpit?
[10:28.480 --> 10:30.440]  I love that name for some reason.
[10:30.440 --> 10:32.580]  The headline says bad memories.
[10:32.580 --> 10:33.580]  Let's read this.
[10:33.580 --> 10:34.980]  It says, love the podcast.
[10:34.980 --> 10:38.420]  Very informative with easy to follow descriptions.
[10:38.420 --> 10:42.200]  Absolutely love the idea of having all the past episodes to refer to.
[10:42.200 --> 10:47.080]  In 87, I tried my first indoor grill with absolutely no idea what I was doing.
[10:47.080 --> 10:49.540]  What a miserable failure it was.
[10:49.540 --> 10:52.460]  Isn't it so much easier now that we've got the internet and a little bit of guidance?
[10:52.460 --> 10:54.700]  I'm so glad I can help you out.
[10:54.700 --> 10:55.700]  The review keeps going.
[10:55.700 --> 11:00.240]  It says, if only I had someone like Rasta Jeff I could have listened to every Monday
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.020]  and Thursday, I might not have wasted those huge watermelon sized skunk seeds.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.380]  Oh, I bet those were great.
[11:06.380 --> 11:08.940]  I'm sorry we wasted those, but we've got more seeds.
[11:08.940 --> 11:09.940]  Don't worry.
[11:09.940 --> 11:14.940]  He goes on to say, it was the nastiest skunk smell oozing from the bags at that time.
[11:14.940 --> 11:18.760]  For years in Florida, you could not count on the skunk bud between, or you could count
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.120]  on the skunk bud between October and December like clockwork.
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.440]  Deliciously nasty skunk bud.
[11:24.440 --> 11:26.360]  You're making my mouth water every time you say that.
[11:26.360 --> 11:29.920]  You were in love with that skunk bud and I think my taste buds and my nose are into that.
[11:29.920 --> 11:34.720]  Why do we love the most disgusting, like the worst aromas are really the best when it comes
[11:34.720 --> 11:35.720]  to cannabis.
[11:35.720 --> 11:37.800]  You're like, it kind of smells like puke and skunk and dirty feet.
[11:37.800 --> 11:39.480]  And you're like, cool, I'll take two, please.
[11:39.480 --> 11:41.840]  It's really strange that we're like that.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.840]  The review continues.
[11:42.840 --> 11:45.040]  It says, never to be smelled again.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.040]  Now I'm heartbroken.
[11:46.040 --> 11:47.920]  I just built myself up to get my heart broken.
[11:48.080 --> 11:49.080]  That's miserable.
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.040]  Then it says, what I would give for another try at those seeds.
[11:52.040 --> 11:53.520]  Damn it, man.
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.520]  Bad memories.
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.080]  Well, if you're a seed shopper, if you were into shopping for seeds on the internet, I
[11:58.080 --> 12:01.200]  would recommend you find something called road kill skunk.
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.540]  If you can find some good road kill skunk, they'll be hard to find.
[12:04.540 --> 12:07.520]  They may not be available on a lot of the commercial websites, but if you can find some
[12:07.520 --> 12:09.480]  of the RKS, grow that out.
[12:09.480 --> 12:14.200]  You may get some of that old, nasty, disgusting, delicious skunk smell that you're talking
[12:14.200 --> 12:15.200]  about.
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.200]  I am sorry and you're welcome that I'm bringing back terrible memories of your failed to grow
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.200]  experience.
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.720]  But now that you've got me around, now that you've got the internet, hopefully we can
[12:24.720 --> 12:25.720]  fix that.
[12:25.720 --> 12:28.160]  Hopefully your next grow is top notch.
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.800]  Hopefully we can put some fresh new memories in your head and wipe out that old memory.
[12:31.800 --> 12:33.200]  Or maybe you can compare the two.
[12:33.200 --> 12:34.460]  We'll leave them both in there.
[12:34.460 --> 12:37.640]  You probably smoked enough for that old memory is kind of hazy anyway.
[12:37.640 --> 12:39.000]  So let's get you growing some new stuff.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.840]  You've got some grow lessons, you've got some good guidance, you've got some good advice,
[12:41.840 --> 12:43.400]  and I'll answer your questions.
[12:43.400 --> 12:44.400]  So let's get you growing.
[12:44.400 --> 12:47.240]  Let's get you a new harvest and then you can look at the new harvest and then you can
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.520]  try to remember back on that old one and you can just feel proud inside for how much you've
[12:51.520 --> 12:54.960]  improved and how much you've learned and how far you've come.
[12:54.960 --> 12:59.360]  And Willie's Armpit, I'm glad that you find the episodes to be informative and easy to
[12:59.360 --> 13:00.360]  follow.
[13:00.360 --> 13:03.200]  I'm glad you like my descriptions and I'm glad that you were learning along with the
[13:03.200 --> 13:04.200]  podcast.
[13:04.200 --> 13:05.780]  Let me know how your next crop goes.
[13:05.780 --> 13:08.880]  Let's erase those bad memories and replace them with some pride.
[13:08.880 --> 13:11.040]  Hey, Willie's Armpit, thanks again for the great review.
[13:11.040 --> 13:15.640]  And of course, Willie's Armpit and The Dark Knight gave us five star reviews.
[13:15.640 --> 13:17.080]  Thanks to both of you for those.
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.080]  Let's move forward.
[13:18.080 --> 13:21.820]  This next one comes from a person who calls themselves Dean221.
[13:21.820 --> 13:23.660]  They gave us a five star rating.
[13:23.660 --> 13:26.500]  The review goes like this.
[13:26.500 --> 13:29.440]  Most informative and entertaining growth show ever.
[13:29.440 --> 13:30.640]  I should just stop reading right there.
[13:30.640 --> 13:33.760]  Oh no, I should keep going because it says Rasta Jeff is my hero.
[13:33.760 --> 13:35.840]  Man, that is the coolest review ever.
[13:35.840 --> 13:36.840]  Most informative.
[13:36.840 --> 13:39.600]  I like that you didn't say best because best is a relative term.
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.820]  I like that you feel I am the most informative as well as the most entertaining.
[13:43.820 --> 13:44.820]  That means a lot to me.
[13:44.820 --> 13:45.820]  Thank you.
[13:45.820 --> 13:49.240]  Being your hero is kind of a lot of pressure and you need better heroes, but thank you.
[13:49.240 --> 13:50.240]  That is a great compliment.
[13:50.240 --> 13:53.400]  I'm just trying to play that one down because I don't know what to say about that, but thank
[13:53.400 --> 13:54.400]  you.
[13:54.400 --> 13:56.160]  Let's continue with the review.
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.160]  Where is it?
[13:57.160 --> 13:58.160]  I lost it.
[13:58.160 --> 13:59.160]  Here it is.
[13:59.160 --> 14:02.460]  It says I am brand new to stealth growing personal medicine and I listen constantly.
[14:02.460 --> 14:05.560]  I'm 63 and I feel born again.
[14:05.560 --> 14:06.960]  Thanks Rasta Jeff.
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.640]  It is great to be a 63 year old person's hero.
[14:11.640 --> 14:16.040]  Usually we look up to somebody who is our senior and I've got somebody who is my senior
[14:16.040 --> 14:17.040]  looking up to me.
[14:17.040 --> 14:18.600]  So that means a lot to me.
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.120]  You are brand new to stealth growing your personal medicine.
[14:22.120 --> 14:24.280]  If you have any questions, please send me an email.
[14:24.280 --> 14:26.560]  I will answer your questions via email.
[14:26.560 --> 14:27.760]  We don't have to read them on the show.
[14:27.760 --> 14:29.940]  We can keep them between us since you are stealth growing.
[14:29.940 --> 14:33.600]  It sounds like you may be in somewhere we can't discuss everything on the show.
[14:33.600 --> 14:35.080]  So send me questions if you've got them.
[14:35.080 --> 14:36.840]  I would love to help you out.
[14:36.920 --> 14:40.160]  Please send me a few good questions and I will put together another stealth growing
[14:40.160 --> 14:41.160]  episode.
[14:41.160 --> 14:42.960]  Those always seem to be a lot of fun.
[14:42.960 --> 14:43.960]  And keep listening.
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.760]  But most of all, thank you for the great review and also thank you for the five star rating.
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.960]  I really appreciate that Dean221 and I look forward to getting some emails with stealth
[14:53.960 --> 14:56.240]  growing questions from you.
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.240]  All right.
[14:57.240 --> 15:01.600]  This next review comes from a person who calls themselves DaddyO45.
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.680]  They gave us a five star rating.
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.960]  The headline of the review is Rasta Jeff and White Mike killing it once again.
[15:07.960 --> 15:10.640]  And the review goes just like this.
[15:10.640 --> 15:11.800]  Killer show like always.
[15:11.800 --> 15:14.440]  Plus, it's a White Mike episode.
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.480]  They thought they were commenting on a specific episode.
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.280]  Hey Mike, it looks like people are enjoying your episodes.
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.680]  So you need to find time to come back and record more frequently, my friend.
[15:23.680 --> 15:24.680]  They keep going.
[15:24.680 --> 15:28.460]  The review says, that means it's a very fun and informative show.
[15:28.460 --> 15:29.800]  Thanks for all the advice.
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.520]  It seems to just fall out of your guys' minds when you two get together.
[15:34.360 --> 15:35.480]  Hey, thanks for the great compliment.
[15:35.480 --> 15:39.440]  Thanks for listening to the show and thanks for the great review and thanks for the five
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.800]  stars and I will pass the message along to Mike.
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.080]  He is probably listening, so he's going to hear it right now.
[15:45.080 --> 15:47.680]  Hey Mike, people do approve.
[15:47.680 --> 15:48.680]  Come record bro.
[15:48.680 --> 15:49.680]  I miss you.
[15:49.680 --> 15:50.680]  I miss hanging out Mike.
[15:50.680 --> 15:51.680]  Come take a dab.
[15:51.680 --> 15:52.680]  All right.
[15:52.680 --> 15:53.680]  I'm going to move forward.
[15:53.680 --> 15:54.680]  We've got another review.
[15:54.680 --> 15:57.400]  This one is titled, This is the One.
[15:57.400 --> 15:59.240]  They gave us a five star rating.
[15:59.240 --> 16:01.560]  This one is left by our friend, Glenn Jerome.
[16:01.560 --> 16:02.680]  Big shout out to Glenn Jerome.
[16:02.840 --> 16:03.840]  Thanks for all the support.
[16:03.840 --> 16:06.560]  The review goes like this.
[16:06.560 --> 16:10.760]  Fantastic content, specific, actionable and clear.
[16:10.760 --> 16:12.720]  I think those were the exact goals.
[16:12.720 --> 16:13.720]  So thank you.
[16:13.720 --> 16:14.720]  I appreciate that.
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.120]  I love how Jeff doesn't babble in tribal knowledge and bro science.
[16:18.120 --> 16:20.440]  Well, I appreciate that.
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.400]  Sometimes I try to make things understandable for everybody and I'm glad it doesn't seem
[16:24.400 --> 16:27.160]  like I'm bro sciencing things when I do that.
[16:27.160 --> 16:30.640]  I want everybody to be able to enjoy and appreciate the show.
[16:30.640 --> 16:33.000]  I want everybody to be able to learn from the show.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.680]  People who are thinking about buying a gross setup and people that have been running commercial
[16:37.680 --> 16:39.760]  facilities, I want them both to be entertained.
[16:39.760 --> 16:44.200]  So sometimes I do have to take a huge concept and kind of make it a little simplified for
[16:44.200 --> 16:45.480]  the new people to figure it out.
[16:45.480 --> 16:48.280]  But I also have to stay entertaining for the people that have been doing it.
[16:48.280 --> 16:50.680]  So I'm glad you don't find it to be bro science.
[16:50.680 --> 16:53.520]  I appreciate that is what I think I'm trying to say.
[16:53.520 --> 16:54.520]  The message continues.
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.280]  He says, this show along with the DGC, that is the Dude Gross Show, have brought me from
[16:59.280 --> 17:04.560]  growing some slightly dank popcorn baby buds to cultivating massive dank buds.
[17:04.560 --> 17:07.240]  Well, I'm glad we could improve your grow.
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.480]  That is the main goal here is to get everybody growing massive dank buds.
[17:11.480 --> 17:13.600]  I'm glad we've got you up to speed.
[17:13.600 --> 17:14.600]  The review continues.
[17:14.600 --> 17:16.360]  It says, I look forward to each episode.
[17:16.360 --> 17:20.800]  Also I will take a fat dad and give my mom a hug for both of us.
[17:20.800 --> 17:23.800]  Much love brother Glenn in Oklahoma.
[17:23.800 --> 17:26.560]  Those folks in Oklahoma are killing it right now.
[17:26.560 --> 17:28.560]  Oklahoma is kind of the new Colorado.
[17:28.560 --> 17:29.560]  It's the wild, wild west.
[17:29.560 --> 17:32.920]  I hope you guys are having a great time while you can down there.
[17:32.920 --> 17:33.920]  Enjoy it while it lasts.
[17:33.920 --> 17:35.160]  I'm not saying it's going to go away.
[17:35.160 --> 17:36.160]  It's just going to change.
[17:36.160 --> 17:37.440]  It will tighten up right now.
[17:37.440 --> 17:38.560]  It's the wild, wild west.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.560]  You're running freestyle.
[17:39.560 --> 17:41.760]  Get it while you can, my friend.
[17:41.760 --> 17:44.240]  Also Glenn Jerome, thanks for the great review.
[17:44.240 --> 17:45.680]  Thanks for the five-star rating.
[17:45.680 --> 17:47.200]  And also thanks for the great compliments.
[17:47.200 --> 17:49.600]  And dude, thanks for doing a great job in your garden.
[17:49.600 --> 17:53.920]  I'm glad you've gone from little popcorn buds to massive dank buds.
[17:53.920 --> 17:57.840]  I'm glad that between the Dude Gross Show and myself, we were able to get you up to
[17:57.840 --> 17:58.840]  speed.
[17:58.840 --> 18:00.400]  Big shout out to all my friends at the Dude Gross Show.
[18:00.400 --> 18:03.600]  I love that we've got a good network going on.
[18:03.600 --> 18:06.880]  We've got one more customer review to read in this episode.
[18:06.880 --> 18:10.240]  This one comes from a friend who calls himself Charlie Moody.
[18:10.240 --> 18:12.760]  The title of the review is really enjoying this.
[18:12.760 --> 18:15.520]  And of course we got another five-star rating.
[18:15.520 --> 18:18.080]  The review goes like this.
[18:18.080 --> 18:19.720]  I started, oh, where did it go?
[18:19.720 --> 18:20.720]  The screen moved.
[18:20.720 --> 18:21.720]  There we go.
[18:21.720 --> 18:23.080]  I started with the Planning Your Grow episode.
[18:23.080 --> 18:25.720]  When I got to the repeats, I went back to the early hundreds.
[18:25.720 --> 18:27.520]  I just finished number 161.
[18:27.520 --> 18:30.000]  Man, you've heard a lot of content.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.440]  And I think you did very well by starting with the Planning Your Grow episode.
[18:33.440 --> 18:35.440]  And you're all the way back to 161.
[18:35.440 --> 18:36.440]  That is crazy.
[18:36.440 --> 18:38.040]  You have listened to a lot of content.
[18:38.040 --> 18:43.480]  He goes on to say, I appreciate the detail, the wealth of experience, and the good humor.
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.760]  I love that in all of the reviews, every time I read a batch of reviews, there's always
[18:47.760 --> 18:50.560]  one person that mentions the attempt at humor.
[18:50.560 --> 18:52.120]  I'm glad that somebody enjoys it.
[18:52.120 --> 18:53.800]  I try to have fun with this.
[18:53.880 --> 18:56.000]  I did not have fun in school.
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.720]  I love learning, but I did not like sitting somewhere for eight hours being told that
[19:01.720 --> 19:05.480]  I can't tap my foot or that I can't just stare off into space.
[19:05.480 --> 19:06.480]  Yeah, I'm listening.
[19:06.480 --> 19:09.640]  I'm just staring off into space because that's how my brain absorbs stuff.
[19:09.640 --> 19:10.760]  They want me to look at the teacher.
[19:10.760 --> 19:12.360]  I just didn't like being there.
[19:12.360 --> 19:14.280]  I had teachers that were entertaining.
[19:14.280 --> 19:16.580]  I had teachers that told me jokes.
[19:16.580 --> 19:20.160]  Those are the classes that I chose to go to more frequently.
[19:20.160 --> 19:23.840]  Later on in my school career, there were a lot of classes I would skip because the
[19:23.840 --> 19:25.920]  teacher was not enjoyable.
[19:25.920 --> 19:27.040]  I hated that class.
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.040]  I just wouldn't go.
[19:28.040 --> 19:31.680]  If the teacher was better, if he was funny, if she was funny, I had much more of a chance
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.040]  of going to that class.
[19:33.040 --> 19:34.680]  I try to teach with a little bit of humor.
[19:34.680 --> 19:37.920]  I think it makes everything stick a little bit better.
[19:37.920 --> 19:41.760]  I fill you up with a whole bunch of knowledge, and then I just seal it in there with a joke.
[19:41.760 --> 19:46.000]  A whole bunch of stuff, a whole bunch of stuff, and then a joke so it doesn't feel stressful.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.960]  Normal learning can be stressful.
[19:47.960 --> 19:52.280]  Trying to cram a bunch of stuff into your brain can be stressful and overwhelming sometimes.
[19:52.280 --> 19:55.840]  Then if you tell a joke at the end, wash it off with a little bit of laughter.
[19:55.840 --> 19:58.680]  Hopefully a lot of that knowledge retains, and then it doesn't feel stressful at the
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.920]  end of the lesson.
[19:59.920 --> 20:01.520]  I'm glad you enjoy my attempt at humor.
[20:01.520 --> 20:05.200]  I want to give you a big thank you for the great review, and also a big thanks for the
[20:05.200 --> 20:06.520]  five-star rating.
[20:06.520 --> 20:10.680]  I want to thank everybody that has left an iTunes customer review.
[20:10.680 --> 20:11.840]  I really do appreciate it.
[20:11.840 --> 20:14.680]  It really does help us move up in the iTunes rankings.
[20:14.680 --> 20:16.640]  It helps more people see the show.
[20:16.640 --> 20:19.800]  The more people that see the show, the more people are growing better cannabis, and that
[20:19.800 --> 20:20.800]  is our goal here.
[20:20.800 --> 20:23.480]  We want everybody growing the best cannabis possible.
[20:23.480 --> 20:27.600]  All right, podcast world, that's all I've got for you for this quick Thursday episode.
