[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.480 --> 00:02.800]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:02.800 --> 00:07.360]  It is time for episode 504 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.360 --> 00:09.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me, Rasta Jeff.
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.960]  Welcome to the show.
[00:10.960 --> 00:16.680]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our only official sponsor, Seeds Here Now.
[00:16.680 --> 00:17.680]  That's right.
[00:17.680 --> 00:21.840]  If you need new, regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.200]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:25.200 --> 00:34.920]  It has become a tradition to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[00:34.920 --> 00:40.440]  I've been taking dabs of Lemon Wreath Live Batter from my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.320]  This is a blend of Cambrouillet and Secret Cushmints.
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.160]  On the package, the flavor is described as lemon rind and tea tree oil.
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.640]  You know, I'm going to completely agree with that.
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.160]  There is also a little bit of funk in there that I cannot quite describe, but I will give
[00:56.160 --> 00:58.720]  it lemon rind and tea tree oil.
[00:58.720 --> 01:01.120]  Those flavors are absolutely present.
[01:01.120 --> 01:05.080]  The flavor just lingers on your tongue when you hit this concentrate.
[01:05.080 --> 01:11.320]  On the back of the package, it does say the product contains 66.7% THC.
[01:11.320 --> 01:16.840]  When I hit this stuff, I get a really nice tunnel vision-y, chatter-y, rambly sort of
[01:16.840 --> 01:21.520]  a buzz, so I think this will make great podcast concentrates.
[01:21.520 --> 01:28.160]  Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Lemon Wreath Live Batter.
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.880]  Before we get to that portion of the show, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends
[01:36.880 --> 01:38.960]  from Patreon.
[01:38.960 --> 01:42.520]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:42.520 --> 01:44.680]  to our new friend, Lernon and Bernon.
[01:44.680 --> 01:47.560]  I always want to send a giant shout out to M. Wagner.
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.920]  Let's send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Gabriel.
[01:50.920 --> 01:53.960]  I always want to send a giant thank you shout out to Jacob W.
[01:53.960 --> 01:57.360]  Of course, we need to send a giant high five to James Brown.
[01:57.360 --> 02:01.080]  I always owe a big fist bump and a thank you to Keith K.
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.120]  Of course, let's send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out and a high
[02:05.120 --> 02:06.920]  five to Zoso J.
[02:06.920 --> 02:09.520]  I always want to send some love to my friend, Tommy.
[02:09.520 --> 02:11.800]  Of course, a big thank you to Stephen Smith.
[02:11.800 --> 02:14.360]  I always want to send a big thank you to Fat Rabbit.
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.800]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you,
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.360]  a high five, and a shout out to our friend, Willie's armpit.
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.800]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on the Patreon
[02:28.800 --> 02:29.880]  campaign.
[02:29.880 --> 02:33.580]  If you would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[02:33.580 --> 02:39.640]  visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.

[02:49.640 --> 02:53.800]  your heart to find my actual Patreon support page.
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.600]  You can't go to Patreon and search for my name to find it.
[02:57.600 --> 03:00.560]  You have to use the actual URL.
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.360]  It's P-A-T-R-E-O-N.
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.640]  That's patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:08.640 --> 03:10.320]  That will take you directly there.
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.960]  Unfortunately, I think I've been shadow banned because of the content that I do provide is
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.360]  cannabis based.
[03:16.360 --> 03:21.800]  Either way, you can find it by typing in the full URL and I will appreciate your support
[03:21.800 --> 03:24.000]  and I'll give you a shout out on the show.
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.600]  All right, let's move away from that.
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.600]  It's starting to feel like a pledge drive.
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.120]  Let's move into the email portion of this podcast.
[03:32.120 --> 03:37.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, I love answering grow questions from my listeners.
[03:37.100 --> 03:41.580]  If you send me an email and you ask me a cultivation or a cannabis culture question,
[03:41.580 --> 03:45.620]  I will do my best to read and answer your question on the show.
[03:45.620 --> 03:49.620]  So send me all of your cannabis cultivation and culture questions.
[03:49.620 --> 03:54.780]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:54.780 --> 03:59.060]  The first email in today's episode goes a lot like this.
[03:59.060 --> 04:04.500]  It says, dear Rasta Jeff, I have a question, but first I would like to tell you why I enjoy
[04:04.500 --> 04:06.840]  listening to your podcast.
[04:06.840 --> 04:09.640]  It says, you speak well and are well spoken.
[04:09.640 --> 04:10.640]  Hey, thank you.
[04:10.640 --> 04:11.640]  That means a lot to me.
[04:11.640 --> 04:13.240]  I try to speak clearly.
[04:13.240 --> 04:16.720]  I get going way too fast for my own good sometimes.
[04:16.720 --> 04:22.280]  My brain travels much more quickly than my mouth, so I try to keep that under control.
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.280]  Thank you for noticing I'm trying to control my face and make the right sounds.
[04:26.280 --> 04:28.120]  I do appreciate that.
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.120]  It goes on to say, regardless of how much knowledge someone may have, I cannot stand
[04:34.200 --> 04:38.720]  to listen to poor speakers or poor quality audio.
[04:38.720 --> 04:40.640]  I completely agree with that.
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.960]  If somebody calls in on a podcast and I can tell they're on the phone, or if they're calling
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.160]  in on a shitty Skype connection and there's a long delay, or if it sounds like this and
[04:49.160 --> 04:52.720]  they're talking from the phone behind the microphone, I can't fucking stand it.
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.560]  I will not listen to that show.
[04:54.560 --> 04:55.560]  So I agree with you.
[04:55.560 --> 04:58.320]  I think quality audio is very important.
[04:58.320 --> 05:03.200]  I started off in the music scene, in the music industry before I wanted to be a podcaster.
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.840]  I actually had another friend who was doing a podcast and he asked me to be a guest.
[05:08.840 --> 05:15.640]  And I actually refused to be a guest on his show unless he allowed me to produce the episode
[05:15.640 --> 05:22.560]  on which I appeared, because until then, his show did not sound up to my standards.
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.020]  I have a lot of equipment from the time I spent recording and producing and participating
[05:27.020 --> 05:28.280]  in the music industry.
[05:28.280 --> 05:29.720]  I used to play drums on the road.
[05:29.720 --> 05:30.840]  I've done a lot of music stuff.
[05:30.840 --> 05:33.040]  I had a lot of fancy toys.
[05:33.040 --> 05:36.280]  So I told my buddy, come to my spot, let's do your show here.
[05:36.280 --> 05:37.840]  I got really good at recording.
[05:37.840 --> 05:40.800]  I made that podcast sound good in my opinion.
[05:40.800 --> 05:43.640]  So I've had a lot of practice and I've come a long way.
[05:43.640 --> 05:46.780]  So the short answer to that is I agree with you, bro.
[05:46.780 --> 05:52.280]  It's hard to listen to a poor quality podcast and somebody that doesn't speak well is even
[05:52.280 --> 05:54.520]  harder for me to listen to.
[05:54.520 --> 05:55.640]  I'm going to get back on track.
[05:55.640 --> 05:59.040]  I told you that lemon wreath dab got me fucking rambly.
[05:59.040 --> 06:01.000]  I'm going to try to focus for you.
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.000]  Where are we?
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.480]  It says, you are very knowledgeable and you present it well.
[06:05.480 --> 06:10.160]  It is obvious you take the time to plan and lay out the podcast.
[06:10.160 --> 06:11.160]  That means a lot to me.
[06:11.160 --> 06:15.520]  A lot of people probably don't realize that it takes a little bit of time and effort to
[06:15.520 --> 06:18.320]  actually create a podcast.
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.480]  The ideas have to come from somewhere.
[06:20.480 --> 06:21.940]  What am I going to talk about?
[06:21.940 --> 06:25.800]  If somebody didn't send me an email to prompt my brain, I don't have a subject.
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.840]  I've got to invent a topic.
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.440]  I've got to make an outline.
[06:29.440 --> 06:30.520]  Then I've got to record it.
[06:30.520 --> 06:33.320]  Then of course I edit it and I put it up on all the servers.
[06:33.320 --> 06:35.400]  It does take a little bit of effort.
[06:35.400 --> 06:39.400]  So thank you for noticing that I do take a little bit of time out of my life, out of
[06:39.400 --> 06:45.360]  my day to actually lay out the podcast to make it something that can be useful for many
[06:45.360 --> 06:46.360]  different listeners.
[06:46.360 --> 06:48.360]  I want everybody to be able to learn from this.
[06:48.360 --> 06:50.160]  It sounds like I'm hitting my target.
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.880]  Let me keep moving because there is a lot more to this message.
[06:52.880 --> 06:58.360]  It says, you are funny, which makes listening entertaining as well as informative.
[06:58.360 --> 06:59.840]  I've said this before.
[06:59.840 --> 07:05.200]  When I went to school, I loved learning, but I hated sitting there being bored.
[07:05.200 --> 07:07.280]  It felt like I was being lectured.
[07:07.280 --> 07:11.960]  Many of my teachers did not have any flavor or style to their teaching.
[07:11.960 --> 07:15.960]  They basically opened up a curriculum book and shot it at us and we were supposed to
[07:15.960 --> 07:17.000]  absorb it.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.320]  I did have a few teachers who would take their time and actually learn their students and
[07:22.320 --> 07:26.600]  figure out how we learn best and find the obstacles we're experiencing and help us
[07:26.600 --> 07:27.600]  get over those.
[07:27.600 --> 07:34.100]  I had a few very wonderful teachers, but unfortunately that was not the regular experience.
[07:34.100 --> 07:37.560]  Most of the time I was bored in school or frustrated in school.
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.240]  I felt like I learned things rather quickly and when everybody else was catching on, I
[07:42.240 --> 07:44.340]  was finding a way to get in trouble.
[07:44.340 --> 07:47.320]  So I hated being in school, but I love learning.
[07:47.320 --> 07:53.080]  When I had entertaining teachers or teachers that took a moment to connect, I really excelled.
[07:53.080 --> 07:56.960]  So I feel like if I sneak a couple of jokes or say something a little bit silly just to
[07:56.960 --> 08:00.280]  keep your attention going, it's like throwing you a treat.
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.280]  You know what I mean?
[08:01.280 --> 08:03.440]  You've had all this learning, now here's a little snack for your brain.
[08:03.440 --> 08:04.480]  It's a little bit of a reward.
[08:04.480 --> 08:05.580]  It makes you smile.
[08:05.580 --> 08:08.360]  It makes learning fun and you want to do it more.
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.160]  Nobody wants to be fucking lectured.
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.660]  So I try to keep it a little bit fun.
[08:11.660 --> 08:12.920]  That way it keeps your attention.
[08:12.920 --> 08:15.200]  That way you can learn some stuff and have a good time.
[08:15.200 --> 08:19.840]  So I do appreciate that you think I'm funny, but do not encourage me.
[08:19.840 --> 08:23.200]  I don't need encouragement to be the class clown.
[08:23.200 --> 08:25.040]  I do appreciate all of the compliments.
[08:25.040 --> 08:30.660]  I do appreciate all of the words of encouragement, but let's move to the question part of this
[08:30.660 --> 08:31.720]  email.
[08:31.720 --> 08:32.960]  The question goes like this.
[08:32.960 --> 08:33.960]  Now for my question.
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.360]  I listened to your series of grow lessons, which were very helpful.
[08:38.360 --> 08:44.800]  In episode 73, you discuss a perpetual grow where you are harvesting one plant every two
[08:44.920 --> 08:45.920]  weeks.
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.520]  It says, I like this idea, but how do you deal with the light being further or closer
[08:51.520 --> 08:55.000]  to the plants since they are all different heights?
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  And that is a very good question.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.840]  So this listener is listening to episode 73 where I did discuss creating a perpetual harvest
[09:03.840 --> 09:05.300]  in a small environment.
[09:05.300 --> 09:10.380]  I do believe it was in a five by five tent under one light where you've got four, seven
[09:10.380 --> 09:13.200]  gallon pots flowering at all times.
[09:13.200 --> 09:18.480]  In that perpetual scenario, you would harvest a seven gallon pot every two weeks and replace
[09:18.480 --> 09:21.080]  it with a fresh seven gallon pot.
[09:21.080 --> 09:24.060]  Now this person does raise a very interesting point.
[09:24.060 --> 09:29.800]  They ask, what do you do with that brand new pot that is much smaller and much shorter
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.480]  than the plants that have been in there for two, four, six, and eight weeks?
[09:34.480 --> 09:38.000]  The light is at the top of the tent because you've got many plants that have grown really
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  tall.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.660]  What do I do with this shorter plant that hasn't had time to grow?
[09:42.660 --> 09:46.100]  In the situation I was talking about, the light is not movable.
[09:46.100 --> 09:49.780]  The light needs to remain at the very top of the tent because we've got plants that
[09:49.780 --> 09:51.860]  are fully mature in that room.
[09:51.860 --> 09:54.160]  So the light cannot be adjusted.
[09:54.160 --> 09:56.660]  That means we've got to work from the bottom.
[09:56.660 --> 09:57.940]  We can't move the light down.
[09:57.940 --> 10:02.620]  So we've either got to move the floor up or figure out a way to raise the plant.
[10:02.620 --> 10:04.140]  So let's raise the plant.
[10:04.140 --> 10:09.940]  A very common way to lift plants up off the ground is to get another pot the same size
[10:09.940 --> 10:15.140]  as the pot you're using and simply flip it upside down, use it as a table, and set the
[10:15.140 --> 10:16.780]  pot right on top of that.
[10:16.780 --> 10:21.700]  Now a seven gallon pot is probably going to lift you up somewhere between 12, 16, maybe
[10:21.700 --> 10:26.820]  even 18 inches, just depending on the depth and diameter of the seven gallon pot you've
[10:26.820 --> 10:28.060]  chosen to buy.
[10:28.060 --> 10:34.000]  So that's going to raise your plant up at least 12, maybe 14, 16, maybe 18 inches.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.540]  And that should be sufficient because that plant is going to begin to grow rapidly and
[10:38.620 --> 10:43.420]  it's only going to be the smallest plant in the room for two weeks.
[10:43.420 --> 10:47.540]  So hopefully after two weeks, you can take that one off the pot, set it on the floor,
[10:47.540 --> 10:51.140]  and the next one that comes in can go on that inverted pot.
[10:51.140 --> 10:57.060]  So that is a very easy, affordable, and safe way to raise your new plant up a little bit
[10:57.060 --> 10:59.380]  higher and get it closer to the light.
[10:59.380 --> 11:03.220]  And if you think about it, you've got one seven gallon pot upside down, that's probably,
[11:03.220 --> 11:04.980]  we'll say 16 inches tall.
[11:04.980 --> 11:07.460]  You've got another seven gallon pot on top of that.
[11:07.460 --> 11:09.420]  That's another 16 inches.
[11:09.420 --> 11:14.220]  At that point, we are getting close to three feet off the ground before we've got any plant
[11:14.220 --> 11:15.880]  coming out of the container.
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.060]  If you're in a tent, you've probably only got six and a half, maybe seven feet worth
[11:20.060 --> 11:22.180]  of vertical height minus your light.
[11:22.180 --> 11:27.420]  So you're already getting that plant plenty close to the light, in my opinion.
[11:27.420 --> 11:33.620]  So that is a very affordable and very effective way to raise your plant about 16 inches and
[11:33.620 --> 11:37.500]  get it closer to the light, get it up there to the top of the canopy.
[11:37.500 --> 11:40.700]  And I understand that you want to get that light to all of your plants, but you are going
[11:40.700 --> 11:44.060]  to have a little bit of a difference that you cannot fight.
[11:44.060 --> 11:45.060]  That's okay.
[11:45.060 --> 11:47.620]  Those big budded plants are going to get more light.
[11:47.620 --> 11:49.820]  Your smaller plants are going to get less light.
[11:49.820 --> 11:50.820]  That is just fine.
[11:50.820 --> 11:55.340]  In that five by five tent, if you've got a 600 or a thousand watt light, you will be
[11:55.340 --> 12:00.340]  pumping out enough light throughout that tiny reflective space where all of the plants should
[12:00.340 --> 12:02.380]  get enough light to be happy.
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.020]  And if you feel like you may need to defoliate or move some branches over a certain way,
[12:07.020 --> 12:09.380]  don't be afraid to defoliate strategically.
[12:09.380 --> 12:12.260]  Don't be afraid to bottom and lollipop strategically.
[12:12.260 --> 12:15.700]  If a leaf is blocking a bud site, feel free to take it out of there.
[12:15.700 --> 12:19.580]  Eventually you'll learn how to snap and pop the stems and just move them the way you need
[12:19.580 --> 12:20.860]  them right out of the way.
[12:20.860 --> 12:23.620]  You'll be able to shape and structure your plants the way you want.
[12:23.620 --> 12:27.860]  We will talk more about shaping and structuring our plants in a future episode.
[12:27.860 --> 12:29.700]  All right, let's wrap up this email.
[12:29.700 --> 12:31.260]  It says, thanks.
[12:31.260 --> 12:34.740]  Keep up the great podcasts from your friend, Rodney.
[12:34.740 --> 12:37.260]  Hey Rodney, thank you for the great email.
[12:37.260 --> 12:40.680]  If you do run that perpetual grow, I would love to see pictures.
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.200]  If you have any questions or if you need more help, please send me a followup email.
[12:45.200 --> 12:46.380]  You know how to find me.
[12:46.380 --> 12:47.380]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[12:47.380 --> 12:52.500]  All right, I do have another email right here in front of me.
[12:52.500 --> 12:54.020]  Let's see if they want their name said.
[12:54.020 --> 12:58.460]  This one comes from our friend Trent and it goes just like this.
[12:58.460 --> 13:03.700]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a long time listener and I have learned a lot from you.
[13:03.700 --> 13:07.580]  Hey, thank you for listening and I'm glad you were learning from the show.
[13:07.580 --> 13:12.740]  It goes on to say, I greatly appreciate all of the info you give to our community.
[13:12.740 --> 13:16.740]  I do have one question I was hoping you could help me with.
[13:16.740 --> 13:21.980]  I just started to flower in my tent and I'm looking into what I want to grow for my winter
[13:21.980 --> 13:22.980]  run.
[13:22.980 --> 13:25.660]  I definitely want to grow something from your line.
[13:25.660 --> 13:26.660]  Hey, thank you.
[13:26.660 --> 13:27.660]  I'm honored.
[13:27.860 --> 13:32.460]  It says, but I want to make sure my environment is right for the seeds I buy.
[13:32.460 --> 13:38.060]  Hey, that is very smart of you to have some forethought to make sure you get the appropriate
[13:38.060 --> 13:40.460]  seeds for your grow space.
[13:40.460 --> 13:45.100]  Many people just see some seeds, they see a strain, they see some hype, they spend their
[13:45.100 --> 13:48.820]  money, they get the seeds, they try to grow it and they grow and they go, this does not
[13:48.820 --> 13:51.620]  work for what I thought I was going to do.
[13:51.620 --> 13:55.940]  So I'm really proud of you for thinking about this in advance and actually reaching out
[13:55.940 --> 13:59.020]  to the guy who makes the seeds to get some guidance.
[13:59.020 --> 14:00.020]  That's really smart of you.
[14:00.020 --> 14:03.980]  I wish everybody had the foresight you were using now.
[14:03.980 --> 14:11.220]  It goes on to say, I'm in a four by four tent with a 260 watt quantum board and a rapid
[14:11.220 --> 14:16.820]  LED GrowMal 5 V3 2x2 do it yourself kit.
[14:16.820 --> 14:21.260]  Honestly, most of that is abbreviated and I'm kind of proud of myself for nailing that
[14:21.260 --> 14:25.320]  on the first try, or at least I think I got it on the first try.
[14:25.320 --> 14:27.880]  So our friend Trent is growing in a four by four tent.
[14:27.880 --> 14:29.800]  He's got two LED lights in there.
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.920]  I honestly don't know about those two lights.
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.960]  I don't know how much light that is.
[14:33.960 --> 14:36.460]  We're going to act like that's enough light for the room.
[14:36.460 --> 14:40.360]  It goes on to say, my tent is exhausted to another part of my house.
[14:40.360 --> 14:44.320]  So you're able to move the humidity and heat away from the plants.
[14:44.320 --> 14:46.560]  Hopefully you've got a carbon filter in there.
[14:46.560 --> 14:53.540]  It also says, I grow in an amended soil mix of cocoa, perlite, worm castings, and a bag
[14:53.540 --> 14:56.060]  of super soil and ocean forest.
[14:56.060 --> 14:57.220]  That sounds like a great mix.
[14:57.220 --> 15:00.500]  It says, I don't use nutrients until flower.
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.820]  With all that stuff you've got in there, I think that's going to work.
[15:02.820 --> 15:03.900]  We've got amended soil.
[15:03.900 --> 15:07.300]  I don't know the amendments, but it sounds like you probably put a lot in there because
[15:07.300 --> 15:09.020]  you've got cocoa, perlite, worm castings.
[15:09.020 --> 15:13.500]  Oh, the bag of super soil will get you through there and the ocean forest will help you out.
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.140]  No nutrients until flower.
[15:15.140 --> 15:18.660]  You may get a better performance out of the veg plants if you added a few things, but
[15:18.660 --> 15:21.180]  if it's working for you, keep doing that.
[15:21.180 --> 15:24.340]  Then it says, I use nectar of the gods nutrients.
[15:24.340 --> 15:28.740]  It focuses its regimen with a pH between 6.1 and 6.5.
[15:28.740 --> 15:29.980]  That's going to work for you.
[15:29.980 --> 15:35.420]  It also focuses on using calcium as the main source of everything through veg and through
[15:35.420 --> 15:36.420]  flower.
[15:36.420 --> 15:37.860]  I'm not familiar with how that line is made.
[15:37.860 --> 15:39.340]  I just know that it is quality.
[15:39.340 --> 15:41.100]  I've seen some great outcomes with it.
[15:41.100 --> 15:43.220]  I don't know any details about how they make it.
[15:43.220 --> 15:46.740]  It sounds like you know enough and it's quality for you, so keep doing that.
[15:46.740 --> 15:51.740]  It says there is 52 inches from my soil to my lights.
[15:51.740 --> 15:54.420]  However, I use scrognets.
[15:54.420 --> 15:58.140]  You can grow some semi-longer growing things with that much space.
[15:58.140 --> 16:03.300]  52 inches from the soil to the lights is just over four feet.
[16:03.300 --> 16:06.380]  Without those scrognets, you're going to have to flip something about a foot and a half,
[16:06.380 --> 16:07.980]  two feet tall, which is not bad.
[16:07.980 --> 16:10.500]  If you top it once, you can get a nice bush.
[16:10.500 --> 16:14.500]  Or if you're using that scrognet like you talk about, maybe let it grow about a third,
[16:14.500 --> 16:16.180]  maybe halfway up and then flip it.
[16:16.180 --> 16:19.260]  Don't let it go too tall because you will start getting close to the lights if you're
[16:19.260 --> 16:21.100]  using one of my strains.
[16:21.100 --> 16:24.740]  But let's keep talking more about your environment.
[16:24.740 --> 16:29.860]  It says my temps at night are 76 degrees and 84 degrees during the day.
[16:29.860 --> 16:34.580]  I can control the humidity with my humidifier and dehumidifier.
[16:34.580 --> 16:40.060]  I was hoping with all of this information, maybe we could figure out a strain to grow.
[16:40.060 --> 16:44.340]  I'm really interested in doing a bit of pheno hunting to narrow down to the best four to
[16:44.340 --> 16:45.620]  grow out.
[16:45.620 --> 16:51.020]  So I would probably need like a five to 10 pack and I would prefer FEMS as well.
[16:51.020 --> 16:54.060]  I hope to hear from you soon, your friend Trent.
[16:54.060 --> 16:57.560]  All right, Trent, it sounds like you've got a pretty nice environment.
[16:57.560 --> 17:00.140]  You don't have too much of a day and night swing.
[17:00.140 --> 17:06.300]  The only major limiting factor here is that 52 inches from the soil to the lights, that
[17:06.300 --> 17:09.140]  is not much space for the way I like to grow.
[17:09.140 --> 17:12.180]  It sounds like you have figured it out by using these scrognets.
[17:12.180 --> 17:15.960]  You were looking for recommendations from my line.
[17:15.960 --> 17:20.040]  You also indicated that you would prefer feminized seeds.
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.220]  So let's talk briefly about some things I would suggest for your grow space.
[17:25.220 --> 17:28.360]  Let's start off with feminized recommendations.
[17:28.360 --> 17:34.180]  If I were to recommend a couple of feminized seeds for your space, I would start off with
[17:34.180 --> 17:35.660]  the Orange Gasm.
[17:35.660 --> 17:41.380]  I think Orange Gasm would work very well in your space because it is a shorter and squattier
[17:41.580 --> 17:42.580]  plant.
[17:42.580 --> 17:45.980]  You don't have a lot of height, so you do need a plant that doesn't get too tall and
[17:45.980 --> 17:48.500]  Orange Gasm will fit that bill.
[17:48.500 --> 17:52.820]  It also will finish a little bit earlier, so you don't have to worry about it stretching
[17:52.820 --> 17:55.460]  for that extra week or two.
[17:55.460 --> 18:00.260]  Another feminized seed I would recommend for your grow is the Michelangelo.
[18:00.260 --> 18:06.500]  Michelangelo is quite similar to the Sun Kiss because it has that same platinum tangy female
[18:06.500 --> 18:07.620]  plant in the mix.
[18:07.620 --> 18:13.380]  The difference is the Orange Gasm is made with a Golden Goat reversed female and the
[18:13.380 --> 18:18.900]  Michelangelo is made with a Blueberry Cookies reversed female.
[18:18.900 --> 18:20.580]  Both of those are feminized.
[18:20.580 --> 18:25.180]  Both of them are going to offer very orange, candy-dominant turps.
[18:25.180 --> 18:29.180]  The Sun Kiss is going to be more orange and possibly grapefruity.
[18:29.180 --> 18:35.580]  The Michelangelo is going to be oranges and some sort of candy and skittly type flavors.
[18:35.580 --> 18:39.860]  Those strains are both very forgiving and very easy to grow and I think they would work
[18:39.860 --> 18:46.380]  very well in your temperatures and with your nutrient mix and in your space.
[18:46.380 --> 18:52.100]  Another feminized cross that I think may work well for you is the Golden Goat.
[18:52.100 --> 18:57.300]  If you are able to scrug it properly, the Golden Goat will perform very well in that
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.300]  environment.
[18:58.300 --> 19:03.300]  I love Golden Goat in a commercial setting because it reacts very well to being netted
[19:03.300 --> 19:04.300]  down.
[19:04.300 --> 19:07.980]  It takes a lot of branches and it loves that type of training.
[19:07.980 --> 19:11.620]  In the description of your room, you said the room hits 84 degrees which means you may
[19:11.620 --> 19:15.620]  have a possible spike of 85 or 86 on occasion.
[19:15.620 --> 19:18.900]  The Golden Goat will handle temperature spikes.
[19:18.900 --> 19:22.740]  It does not get mad at you if it gets a little bit hot in your grow room.
[19:22.740 --> 19:26.860]  So the Golden Goat may work for that high temperature environment.
[19:26.860 --> 19:31.000]  You also indicated that this would be your winter run so maybe you'll be able to push
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  it and keep it nice and cool in there.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.280]  But just in case, that Golden Goat, if it grows too close to the light, it may be able
[19:37.280 --> 19:39.880]  to tolerate those higher temperatures.
[19:39.880 --> 19:44.520]  So those are the three that I would recommend if you want to stick with feminized seeds
[19:44.520 --> 19:46.120]  from my line.
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.160]  I feel like the Lemon Jeffrey may get too tall on you in that space if you don't scrug
[19:50.160 --> 19:54.960]  it and also it does get a little bit long so you may get a little bit of space between
[19:54.960 --> 19:55.960]  your buds.
[19:55.960 --> 20:00.320]  So the Lemon Jeffrey may not be ideal for the scrug environment with such a low type
[20:00.320 --> 20:01.480]  of situation.
[20:01.480 --> 20:06.000]  I would prefer two or three layers of scrug nets for the Lemon Jeffrey because it is going
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.360]  to get long really quickly.
[20:08.360 --> 20:12.080]  But I do think you would have great success with Golden Goat feminized seeds.
[20:12.080 --> 20:16.060]  I think you would have great success with Sun Kiss and I also think you would have great
[20:16.060 --> 20:19.880]  success with Michelangelo seeds in that grow.
[20:19.880 --> 20:25.840]  Now let's talk about a few things you could do if you don't want to run feminized seeds.
[20:25.840 --> 20:29.560]  The number one recommendation from my line I would suggest if you're going to go with
[20:29.560 --> 20:32.520]  the regular seed would be Prana.
[20:32.520 --> 20:36.840]  Prana stays nice and short, nice and squat, nice and bushy.
[20:36.840 --> 20:42.040]  You can spread it out real far and she doesn't mind being stretched and scrugged and trained
[20:42.040 --> 20:43.040]  out.
[20:43.040 --> 20:46.080]  She'll actually respond very well to that type of treatment.
[20:46.080 --> 20:48.060]  Prana actually finishes quite early.
[20:48.060 --> 20:52.100]  You may find a phenotype that finishes at the end of week seven, maybe at the end of
[20:52.100 --> 20:53.100]  week eight.
[20:53.100 --> 20:55.640]  The longest they should go is nine weeks.
[20:55.640 --> 20:59.320]  So I think Prana would work beautifully in your environment.
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.720]  I can also recommend Morning Dew.
[21:02.720 --> 21:05.080]  Morning Dew likes to be scrugged.
[21:05.080 --> 21:07.060]  Morning Dew likes to be stretched out.
[21:07.060 --> 21:11.560]  She will produce big, fat, chunky buds, but they won't get super tall and stretchy on
[21:11.560 --> 21:15.180]  you so it will work very well in that scrug environment.
[21:15.180 --> 21:20.080]  I do recommend with most of my strains, if you're going to do a scrug in that 52-inch
[21:20.080 --> 21:24.820]  space, I would put the first net about a third of the way down and then put that next
[21:24.820 --> 21:29.380]  net probably halfway or maybe a little bit higher up than halfway so that you've got
[21:29.380 --> 21:30.380]  some support.
[21:30.380 --> 21:34.760]  I would like to see two layers of scrug net in that environment if that's at all possible.
[21:34.760 --> 21:39.340]  The first one is a spreader, the second one acts as a support, and then try to fill that
[21:39.340 --> 21:43.340]  entire environment with giant, chunky colas.
[21:43.340 --> 21:48.060]  My third recommendation for your environment if we are not going to do a feminized seed
[21:48.060 --> 21:49.900]  would be Sun Kiss.
[21:49.920 --> 21:52.440]  Sun Kiss is the platinum tangy to a rise.
[21:52.440 --> 21:57.540]  It does like to stay nice and short and squat and it puts off that wonderful orange aroma.
[21:57.540 --> 21:59.880]  It is very similar to the Orange Gasm.
[21:59.880 --> 22:04.840]  It is very similar to the Michelangelo because it's got that platinum tangy mom in there.
[22:04.840 --> 22:07.940]  You can tell I really enjoy breeding to the platinum tangy.
[22:07.940 --> 22:10.440]  Big shout out to Maddie and Spence from the Garden of Weeden.
[22:10.440 --> 22:13.840]  They are the ones who made the platinum tangy that I love so much.
[22:13.840 --> 22:19.240]  But that plant makes short, squat, bushy offspring and it is very easy to grow.
[22:19.460 --> 22:20.580]  That's why I breed with it.
[22:20.580 --> 22:22.140]  That's why I work with it so much.
[22:22.140 --> 22:25.740]  That's why I recommend it so much for this type of situation.
[22:25.740 --> 22:30.540]  If you're going to run regular seeds, I would recommend the Prana, the Morning Dew, and
[22:30.540 --> 22:31.540]  the Sun Kiss.
[22:31.540 --> 22:36.140]  If you're not a super experienced grower and you want a really easy grow, I would go with
[22:36.140 --> 22:40.220]  one of those Femlines and I would go with one of the orange dominant ones, either the
[22:40.220 --> 22:43.180]  Michelangelo or the Orange Gasm.
[22:43.180 --> 22:47.420]  If you want to run regular seeds and you want a really easy grow, I would recommend that
[22:47.420 --> 22:48.720]  Sun Kiss.
[22:48.720 --> 22:52.940]  If you're an experienced grower, I would recommend maybe trying that Golden Goat.
[22:52.940 --> 22:57.580]  If you want to go with regular seeds, then you can try the Prana or maybe the Morning
[22:57.580 --> 22:59.700]  Dew or maybe the Sun Kiss.
[22:59.700 --> 23:04.260]  The Morning Dew is probably going to be the most challenging plant out of all of those.
[23:04.260 --> 23:08.020]  The Sun Kiss and the Morning Dew should be quite easy to grow.
[23:08.020 --> 23:13.060]  I will tell you now that if you grow the Prana or the Morning Dew in that type of environment,
[23:13.060 --> 23:18.460]  be prepared to do some defoliation because both of those plants get quite large leaves
[23:18.480 --> 23:23.900]  and you'll want to pull off some of those big hand-sized leaves to keep the airflow
[23:23.900 --> 23:27.520]  and the light penetration optimal in your tight space.
[23:27.520 --> 23:30.120]  All right, Trent, I want to thank you for the great email.
[23:30.120 --> 23:33.040]  I want to wish you great success in your tent grow.
[23:33.040 --> 23:37.320]  When you are ready to grab those seeds for your winter run, don't forget my friends at

[26:53.100 --> 27:00.100]  You can see it every day.
[27:00.100 --> 27:05.100]  You rise early in the morning, you find the same old thing.
[27:05.100 --> 27:15.100]  Then you start to imagine what the rest of day may bring to you, may bring to you.
[27:15.100 --> 27:21.100]  So you make it right about and return without a thing.
[27:21.100 --> 27:27.100]  And them kind of some things make you really have to think.
[27:27.100 --> 27:30.100]  Make you really have to think.
[27:30.100 --> 27:36.100]  For when you turn to the right, things doesn't seem so bright.
[27:36.100 --> 27:42.100]  Then you turn to the left, temptation leads you to a fence.
[27:42.100 --> 27:48.100]  So you look up in the sky, you hold your head and wonder why.
[27:48.100 --> 27:53.100]  Then you look down on the ground, you think you're still around.
[27:53.100 --> 27:57.100]  Give your thanks to know you're still around.
[28:09.100 --> 28:15.100]  For when you turn to the right, things doesn't seem so bright.
[28:15.100 --> 28:21.100]  Then you turn to the left, temptation leads you to a fence.
[28:21.100 --> 28:27.100]  So you look up in the sky, you hold your head and wonder why.
[28:27.100 --> 28:32.100]  Then you look down on the ground, you think you're still around.
[28:32.100 --> 28:36.100]  Give your thanks to know you're still around.
[28:36.100 --> 28:42.100]  So how then in the land where there's plenty, so many people still remain hungry.
[28:42.100 --> 28:48.100]  They have it so hard, oh man it ain't easy.
[28:48.100 --> 28:54.100]  They have it so hard, some of them turn to robbing.
[28:59.100 --> 29:06.100]  My heart cries out to see how the youths them struggling.
[29:06.100 --> 29:15.100]  In a land that was made so free for you and me, for you and me.
[29:15.100 --> 29:21.100]  Oh why won't you be, let them go, let them go.
[29:21.100 --> 29:26.100]  Let them loose, they need to be free.
[29:26.100 --> 29:30.100]  Don't you try to slow them down.
[29:31.100 --> 29:35.100]  Let them go, let them go.
[29:35.100 --> 29:38.100]  Let them loose.
