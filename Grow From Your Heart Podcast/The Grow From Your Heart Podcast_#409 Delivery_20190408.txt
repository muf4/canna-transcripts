[00:00.120 --> 00:05.360]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It is time for episode 409 of the Grow From Your
[00:05.360 --> 00:09.400]  Heart Podcast. This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite
[00:09.400 --> 00:13.520]  Seeds. That's right. It's time to add fresh genetics to your garden and you can get them
[00:13.520 --> 00:20.320]  at OregonEliteSeeds.com. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome to the show an international
[00:20.320 --> 00:22.920]  traveler. Welcome back, White Mike. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:22.920 --> 00:23.920]  What's up, buddy? Hey, everybody.
[00:23.920 --> 00:24.920]  Welcome home, man.
[00:24.920 --> 00:25.920]  Yeah, man.
[00:25.920 --> 00:26.920]  Thanks for taking time.
[00:26.920 --> 00:27.920]  Good to be home.
[00:27.920 --> 00:31.320]  You look and sound like you've been on the road for way too long.
[00:31.320 --> 00:34.920]  Yeah, good trip, long trip. Glad to be home.
[00:34.920 --> 00:38.520]  It looks like it could be the nap from your heart podcast over on that side of the table.
[00:38.520 --> 00:44.200]  Yeah. I've been in France for the last 10 days. So I just got back yesterday. It was
[00:44.200 --> 00:49.560]  24 hours of straight travel when we landed at DIA and then drove home down to Pueblo.
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.440]  So far, all of the stories you have told sounded amazing and then you topped it off with that
[00:54.440 --> 00:55.840]  and that sounded grueling.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.520]  Yeah, the trip was amazing, but the ride home was pretty brutal.
[00:59.520 --> 01:02.240]  Yeah, that sounds like a terrible, terrible ride, but worth it, right?
[01:02.240 --> 01:03.880]  So, so worth it.
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.920]  Awesome. We don't want to talk too much about France, but I'm glad you had a great time.
[01:08.920 --> 01:11.360]  Tell us one cool thing about France since we got you on the show. We don't want to go
[01:11.360 --> 01:14.840]  too deep into it. Most people don't listen. Everything?
[01:14.840 --> 01:19.000]  The thing I like is unless you're directly intruding on someone, like poking them with
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.720]  your finger, they don't care what you're doing.
[01:20.720 --> 01:21.720]  Cool.
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.280]  And so pretty much anything goes everywhere, which is really nice.
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.880]  During our conversations, one thing you mentioned several times without any prompting was you
[01:29.880 --> 01:30.880]  can smoke anywhere there.
[01:30.880 --> 01:31.880]  You can fucking smoke everywhere.
[01:31.880 --> 01:32.880]  And you're a cigarette smoker.
[01:32.880 --> 01:36.960]  Well, like outside, there's a lot of non-smoking inside spaces and like you can't smoke in
[01:36.960 --> 01:37.960]  the museums and shit.
[01:37.960 --> 01:38.960]  Oh yeah, hopefully.
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.680]  Every outdoor cafe has ashtrays on the table. There's people smoking everywhere.
[01:44.680 --> 01:48.960]  Cool. For you. Not for guys like me that are grossed out by cigarettes.
[01:48.960 --> 01:53.120]  But I mean, it's part of the, I don't care what you're doing to yourself attitude.
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.240]  It's the way it should be other than me having to smell your damn cigarettes, but you're
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.520]  going to have to smell my reefer.
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.920]  So that leads me into my next question and we can edit anything out if we need to.
[02:02.920 --> 02:07.480]  Did you have any cannabis experience in your journey?
[02:07.480 --> 02:11.520]  Every time we, or the first three times I should say, it kind of teepered off after
[02:11.520 --> 02:12.520]  that.
[02:12.520 --> 02:14.880]  But the first three times we mentioned that we were from Colorado, the person we mentioned
[02:14.880 --> 02:17.000]  it to went, weed's legal there.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.480]  That's awesome.
[02:19.480 --> 02:24.400]  The kid that was selling Nutella waffles, like these bomb ass fucking fresh waffles.
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.760]  And then they just slather them with Nutella and you eat it like, they're like hot dog
[02:28.760 --> 02:30.040]  vendors that are fucking everywhere.
[02:30.040 --> 02:32.240]  It's awesome.
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.000]  He basically was like, my shift ends in a couple of hours.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.920]  If you want to score, like I'll hook you up with good weed.
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.800]  We didn't want to hang out for a couple of hours and buy weed from some kid by a tourist
[02:43.800 --> 02:44.800]  attraction.
[02:44.800 --> 02:45.800]  Is it Nutella or Nutella?
[02:45.800 --> 02:46.800]  It depends.
[02:46.800 --> 02:49.400]  I call it both depending on how I feel.
[02:50.320 --> 02:52.640]  You know, that's how I am treated with Viola and Viola extracts.
[02:52.640 --> 02:54.520]  I'm wrong wherever I go.
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.560]  So just say it how you're comfortable.
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.560]  Right.
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.520]  I didn't try to search out any herb while I was there.
[03:01.520 --> 03:03.400]  I figured that would be a waste of time.
[03:03.400 --> 03:04.400]  Yeah.
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.400]  Just enjoy the trip.
[03:05.400 --> 03:08.560]  I was there doing other stuff, so it wasn't a thing.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  Enjoy the sobriety.
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.560]  You took a nice little tolerance break.
[03:10.560 --> 03:12.840]  A tolerance break, that's the word I'm fishing for.
[03:12.840 --> 03:13.840]  Yeah.
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.240]  And you were there with your wife and there's plenty of, dude, I've seen your photos.
[03:16.240 --> 03:20.120]  It doesn't look like there was time to really waste smoking anything.
[03:20.120 --> 03:22.760]  You were busy and entertained the entire time.
[03:22.760 --> 03:23.760]  Yep.
[03:23.760 --> 03:26.800]  We didn't stop the whole time we were there, so now we're fucking exhausted.
[03:26.800 --> 03:27.800]  I can see it.
[03:27.800 --> 03:28.800]  I can hear it.
[03:28.800 --> 03:30.400]  Well, let's move forward from that because it sounds like I'm just wearing you out talking
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.400]  about that.
[03:31.400 --> 03:32.600]  It is a tradition.
[03:32.600 --> 03:36.120]  We like to start the podcast off by talking about what we're smoking on.
[03:36.120 --> 03:43.200]  I just took a dab of GG4 batter and then I rolled that batter around in some Screamin'
[03:43.200 --> 03:45.680]  Tangerines Ambrosia Terps.
[03:45.680 --> 03:48.480]  The liquid terpy part at the bottom of the container was left over.
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.440]  I just scooped that orange flavored deliciousness up off the bottom.
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.120]  Then I had a little bit of Killer Queen High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract.
[03:57.120 --> 04:01.100]  I crunched that up and put a little bit of, I call it the sprinkles, put some sprinkles
[04:01.100 --> 04:02.100]  up on top of there.
[04:02.100 --> 04:04.800]  I took a dab of that and obviously it is working.
[04:04.800 --> 04:06.440]  It's got me nice and rambly.
[04:06.440 --> 04:07.440]  It's got me talkative.
[04:07.440 --> 04:08.920]  I'm in the mood for a great podcast.
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.920]  It's okay that Mike is half asleep over there because I will keep the party moving.
[04:12.920 --> 04:16.320]  Half asleep and the other half is completely glazed.
[04:16.320 --> 04:17.320]  Tolerance breaks are nice, folks.
[04:17.320 --> 04:18.320]  Yes.
[04:18.320 --> 04:19.800]  I let Mike finish my dab.
[04:19.800 --> 04:23.040]  I left a little in there toward the end and I just passed the rig and the carb cap to
[04:23.040 --> 04:25.760]  Mike and he basically took the leftover of that.
[04:25.760 --> 04:28.320]  Then he took a little tiny, tiny batter dab over there.
[04:28.320 --> 04:29.880]  He didn't even need a cigarette.
[04:29.880 --> 04:31.800]  Yeah, I like that GG4 batter.
[04:31.800 --> 04:34.280]  That stuff tastes really nice.
[04:34.280 --> 04:36.480]  I'm a big believer in tolerance breaks.
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.400]  Take one every now and again, folks.
[04:38.400 --> 04:39.560]  It'll do you good.
[04:39.560 --> 04:42.360]  You don't have to go nuts with a long break either.
[04:42.360 --> 04:44.320]  Five, 10 days is more than enough.
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.720]  Did I talk about that on the podcast or on Instagram Live?
[04:47.720 --> 04:50.960]  Somebody asked me about a tolerance break and I said, well, if you're a medical patient,
[04:50.960 --> 04:54.760]  don't do it because you wouldn't tell me stop taking your diabetes or your cholesterol
[04:54.760 --> 04:59.120]  medication for a week so that it works better.
[04:59.120 --> 05:05.560]  One of the things I've talked about with people who do other herbal medications is that type
[05:05.560 --> 05:08.820]  of medicine works best with breaks.
[05:09.080 --> 05:13.420]  Not frequent breaks, but you got to give your body a chance to breathe a little bit.
[05:13.420 --> 05:16.220]  It varies so much from person to person.
[05:16.220 --> 05:21.820]  I've got a stomach thing and I can tell I'm like, oh, I'm going to need to take a couple
[05:21.820 --> 05:26.380]  dabs here in the next hour or two or this stomach thing is going to start bugging me.
[05:26.380 --> 05:29.940]  I don't know if I imagine if I didn't smoke for two full days, my stomach might just start
[05:29.940 --> 05:35.980]  flaring up and the little problem that I've band-aided for years, it may really swell
[05:35.980 --> 05:38.700]  up if I don't give it that constant medicine.
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.080]  I don't want to risk it.
[05:40.080 --> 05:41.980]  It ain't broke, so don't fix it.
[05:41.980 --> 05:42.980]  That's the way I've been thinking.
[05:42.980 --> 05:43.980]  But you're right.
[05:43.980 --> 05:44.980]  Sometimes-
[05:44.980 --> 05:46.140]  See, both things are true.
[05:46.140 --> 05:51.500]  It's not like either one of these positions is mandatory or the right position.
[05:51.500 --> 05:55.620]  I'm getting myself way off track, but none of this is written down.
[05:55.620 --> 05:58.020]  This is all just chatter with Mike and I, so thanks for hanging out.
[05:58.020 --> 05:59.380]  Hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[05:59.380 --> 06:00.420]  They both certainly do.
[06:00.420 --> 06:04.260]  I feel like that first dab I took when you sat down at the table with me, that first
[06:04.260 --> 06:07.340]  one, that may have been a medical marijuana dab.
[06:07.340 --> 06:09.380]  That one took the back pain away.
[06:09.380 --> 06:11.860]  It took the potential stomach issue away.
[06:11.860 --> 06:15.540]  That second one where I put all the crystals and shit, that was a recreational dab.
[06:15.540 --> 06:18.500]  That one was purely just because I want to be a little silly for the show and have a
[06:18.500 --> 06:19.580]  good time.
[06:19.580 --> 06:25.240]  Maybe I do take a tolerance break by only, I minimally dab some days.
[06:25.240 --> 06:27.260]  Just enough to keep the whatever's away.
[06:27.260 --> 06:30.940]  A dab every few hours would keep the doctor away in my world.
[06:30.940 --> 06:32.940]  Maybe I just maintain that.
[06:33.300 --> 06:37.780]  There are days, trust me, like the weekends or when I'm hanging out, going places or a
[06:37.780 --> 06:42.140]  comedy show, those are the days when I really go in.
[06:42.140 --> 06:46.860]  Then I'll find myself the next couple of days, not purposefully, but I'll go a little lighter
[06:46.860 --> 06:51.220]  and give myself not a planned tolerance break, but my lungs will say, hey, you need to go
[06:51.220 --> 06:53.860]  lighter and my system will go, I'm saturated, bro.
[06:53.860 --> 06:57.140]  Even if you dab so hard, you're not going to get anywhere.
[06:57.140 --> 06:58.380]  My body and brain know that.
[06:58.380 --> 07:02.980]  I'll take Monday will be a real light dab day a lot of the time, but Friday, Saturday,
[07:02.980 --> 07:05.740]  and Sunday, I sure did put it in to where I had to take that break.
[07:05.740 --> 07:07.980]  Monday, my body just said, not today, bro.
[07:07.980 --> 07:08.980]  You've been working hard.
[07:08.980 --> 07:12.460]  You got to party that throat burn after a good party.
[07:12.460 --> 07:13.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:13.460 --> 07:14.460]  The lungs are tired.
[07:14.460 --> 07:18.260]  It just- I'm a firm believer in there's a line.
[07:18.260 --> 07:24.060]  If your body's hurting and you're using cannabis to treat it, or you've got a medical condition
[07:24.060 --> 07:31.020]  that you're treating, it takes more consumption to get baked than if you didn't have that
[07:31.020 --> 07:32.020]  condition.
[07:32.020 --> 07:37.820]  That first bit of THC and CBD and whatever else is, the other cannabinoids in the plant,
[07:37.820 --> 07:41.580]  they're all going to medical uses.
[07:41.580 --> 07:46.940]  It's going to help relieve inflammation, relieve pain, relieve whatever.
[07:46.940 --> 07:53.100]  Then after a certain point, your body's like, okay, you can enjoy that part of it now.
[07:53.140 --> 07:55.060]  I think we've gotten what we need to start taking care of this.
[07:55.060 --> 07:56.060]  I agree.
[07:56.060 --> 07:58.180]  I feel like the herb is really smart.
[07:58.180 --> 07:59.660]  It knows, oh, there's pain over here.
[07:59.660 --> 08:01.620]  We're going to go there.
[08:01.620 --> 08:03.740]  First it'll start with your negative.
[08:03.740 --> 08:06.980]  You're already at, you got pain, so that puts you on the negative side.
[08:06.980 --> 08:07.980]  You're like, oh.
[08:07.980 --> 08:08.980]  It'll go, oh, negative.
[08:08.980 --> 08:09.980]  Let's go fix the negative.
[08:09.980 --> 08:10.980]  Then it'll get you back to even.
[08:10.980 --> 08:14.980]  Then when you're even, then it'll go, well, now let's make him happier.
[08:14.980 --> 08:17.220]  Then it makes you a little iry.
[08:17.220 --> 08:19.700]  Right after that, it goes, well, now, yet another dab.
[08:19.700 --> 08:21.260]  That's when we're going to go super positive.
[08:21.420 --> 08:24.620]  Now you're like, oh, I'm high as shit.
[08:24.620 --> 08:27.820]  There is that line.
[08:27.820 --> 08:31.220]  The wife will ask me, you say you're going to go smoke real quick, like real quick is
[08:31.220 --> 08:32.220]  40 minutes.
[08:32.220 --> 08:33.220]  What the fuck?
[08:33.220 --> 08:37.220]  It's like, well, I hadn't smoked today and I was hurting.
[08:37.220 --> 08:40.580]  The first six hits, I didn't get stoned.
[08:40.580 --> 08:42.460]  It was just for my shoulder.
[08:42.460 --> 08:47.700]  The three after that were for my head and it just takes a minute to take nine good rips.
[08:47.700 --> 08:50.220]  You can't just inhale and exhale a bunch of dabs.
[08:50.220 --> 08:51.860]  Part of that sitting down.
[08:51.860 --> 08:54.100]  For me, I'm going to move my notebook and stuff out of the way.
[08:54.100 --> 08:57.540]  I'm actually going to do this because talking about it, what else could go better here?
[08:57.540 --> 08:59.500]  Part of the thing is sitting here with you.
[08:59.500 --> 09:03.020]  I got the dabber in my hand and we both stared at the pile of concentrates like, oh, which
[09:03.020 --> 09:04.100]  one is he going to pick?
[09:04.100 --> 09:05.100]  That's part of the fun.
[09:05.100 --> 09:07.420]  I get to choose which one of these and I'm spoiled.
[09:07.420 --> 09:12.540]  Mike and I, we live five miles away from, there's a dispensary North, South, East and
[09:12.540 --> 09:14.900]  West from us within five minutes of here.
[09:14.900 --> 09:16.380]  We're spoiled little bitches.
[09:16.380 --> 09:18.140]  We know that.
[09:18.140 --> 09:19.340]  You get to grab a dab.
[09:19.460 --> 09:23.940]  I'm going to grab two of them and grab the GG four batter and the tropicana cookies,
[09:23.940 --> 09:24.940]  HCFSE.
[09:24.940 --> 09:27.220]  And I'm going to mix this up and I'm going to get to mix them.
[09:27.220 --> 09:29.700]  I get to, it's just like, it's the same thing with herb though.
[09:29.700 --> 09:34.060]  Like sitting down, figuring out which one, which strain you're going to smoke tonight,
[09:34.060 --> 09:36.380]  picking the nugget you're going to smoke out of the container.
[09:36.380 --> 09:37.380]  That's so much fun.
[09:37.380 --> 09:40.100]  Go up through this bud right here and put it in the grinder.
[09:40.100 --> 09:41.100]  Yeah.
[09:41.100 --> 09:42.460]  So I get myself a little dab.
[09:42.460 --> 09:44.580]  I just stuck the dabber in the GG four batter.
[09:44.580 --> 09:47.580]  I get to like smell it and look at it and pick a little piece.
[09:47.580 --> 09:48.580]  And then the same thing with this crystal.
[09:48.580 --> 09:49.580]  This ash is so pretty people.
[09:49.580 --> 09:50.580]  Get this little diamond on here.
[09:50.580 --> 09:51.580]  So pretty.
[09:51.580 --> 09:52.580]  Scoop up some turps.
[09:52.580 --> 09:55.700]  And then just the whole ritual of it.
[09:55.700 --> 09:56.700]  It's just so nice.
[09:56.700 --> 09:57.700]  And you know what?
[09:57.700 --> 09:59.740]  This ritual is more enjoyable.
[09:59.740 --> 10:01.500]  No, I'm saying that wrong.
[10:01.500 --> 10:02.740]  This is more of a solo ritual.
[10:02.740 --> 10:07.740]  The dab thing, but smoking a bowl with a friend is such a, like there's even more to that.
[10:07.740 --> 10:09.340]  You can make that take an hour.
[10:09.340 --> 10:11.420]  Just smoking one bowl with a friend.
[10:11.420 --> 10:13.300]  So that's part of medicating is what I think I'm saying.
[10:13.300 --> 10:14.920]  The whole ritual is part of it.
[10:14.920 --> 10:17.920]  It's not just, I'm going to consume this.
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.000]  It's I'm going to sit here for a few minutes and get my head right.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.240]  Get my back right.
[10:22.240 --> 10:24.400]  It's all part of a unity sort of a thing.
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.400]  You're connecting with yourself.
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.240]  I'm not going to go all hippie dippy on you, but you take a minute and just get Zen for
[10:30.240 --> 10:31.240]  a moment.
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.280]  Like people that even roll their own cigarettes, they'll talk about like the process is like
[10:36.280 --> 10:38.000]  part of it.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.080]  Taking a minute away, completing something, just a simple routine.
[10:44.240 --> 10:46.160]  It's the same thing with her or her hash.
[10:46.160 --> 10:47.800]  It's like a karate students.
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.200]  They will take time cleaning the dojo because that's part of the art that makes the karate
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.200]  come from your heart.
[10:53.200 --> 10:55.880]  A good drummer will clean and tune his drums and symbols.
[10:55.880 --> 10:59.080]  Like it's just, you got to do the things that make it mean something to you.
[10:59.080 --> 11:02.560]  You can't just always be bashing and getting loud, right?
[11:02.560 --> 11:03.560]  It's the same thing.
[11:03.560 --> 11:10.560]  Like when I go to clean a piece of glass, the ritual of that is, is always real enjoyable.
[11:10.560 --> 11:11.560]  You enjoy cleaning glass.
[11:11.560 --> 11:12.560]  It makes me paranoid.
[11:12.760 --> 11:19.760]  I read this great thing a long time ago that was like the nature of glass is to break.
[11:19.760 --> 11:21.600]  Like that's what the glass is.
[11:21.600 --> 11:23.360]  Purpose is it?
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.080]  So many people are cringing hearing you say that, but you're like, it's true.
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.080]  It's not, it's not permanent.
[11:29.080 --> 11:30.240]  It's fucking glass.
[11:30.240 --> 11:31.240]  It's going to break.
[11:31.240 --> 11:37.720]  And if you just sort of accept that when you buy it every day after that is a cool bonus
[11:37.720 --> 11:41.520]  day with that glass and going through and cleaning it.
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.120]  That I've broken enough pieces to know like the definitely don't do this even when it
[11:46.120 --> 11:51.040]  seems like a good idea or it's the only way to get that little piece of resin or that
[11:51.040 --> 11:52.600]  little ball of hash out of there.
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.440]  This is just keep putting ISO and salt in it and keep shaking it.
[11:57.440 --> 11:58.840]  Don't drop it on concrete.
[11:58.840 --> 12:00.280]  Yeah, please.
[12:00.280 --> 12:01.280]  Yep.
[12:01.280 --> 12:04.360]  But it's a ritual that I enjoy.
[12:04.360 --> 12:07.960]  I buy fairly cheap glass because, well, it's not cheap, but I mean, that's not a super
[12:07.960 --> 12:14.720]  expensive piece because I agree that it is glass and I could be shaking it, cleaning
[12:14.720 --> 12:15.720]  it.
[12:15.720 --> 12:18.880]  My grubby little paws could be a little slippery from that alcohol and it may hit that porcelain
[12:18.880 --> 12:21.400]  or whatever a sink is made out of these days and caboose.
[12:21.400 --> 12:22.400]  There's it goes.
[12:22.400 --> 12:23.400]  There's it goes.
[12:23.400 --> 12:24.400]  There it goes.
[12:24.400 --> 12:25.400]  And I need a new rig now.
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.640]  I remember I had, I put, it was just a cheap, like an $80 bomb.
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.440]  No doubt stem, just the slide in and out bowl, put that under the sink and it was a great
[12:34.440 --> 12:35.440]  setup.
[12:35.440 --> 12:38.360]  It was just perfect with the sink spout and it would fit.
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.000]  So it wouldn't move around and I could just turn the hot water on and let that bitch run
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.080]  for a while and clean out.
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.640]  And I turned the water on and I turned around, I was fucking around in the fridge and I heard
[12:47.640 --> 12:49.880]  the sound, Oh, that turned around.
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.160]  I was like, I know what the fuck happened before I even turned around.
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.760]  And sure enough, right in the middle, there's that little air bubble in that cheap ass glass
[12:55.760 --> 12:56.760]  pop.
[12:56.760 --> 12:57.760]  There it goes.
[12:57.760 --> 12:58.760]  Yeah.
[12:58.760 --> 12:59.760]  Glass breaks folks.
[12:59.760 --> 13:01.280]  It's not a big deal.
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.280]  Glass does break.
[13:02.800 --> 13:05.840]  You guys, we do have a topic, but I think we've been having a good time just rambling
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.840]  about random stuff.
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.000]  Hey Mike, I've got this dad meal right at the perfect temperature.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.560]  So you've got to talk for a couple of seconds.
[13:12.560 --> 13:13.560]  Say something.
[13:13.560 --> 13:15.720]  Should I dive into the topic or go free form?
[13:15.720 --> 13:16.920]  I got one more thing before that.
[13:16.920 --> 13:17.920]  So free form.
[13:17.920 --> 13:18.920]  Okay.
[13:18.920 --> 13:26.080]  So a fun thing that happened here in Colorado recently, um, our governor, Jared Polis added
[13:26.080 --> 13:30.960]  autism officially to the list of conditions that you can get a medical marijuana card
[13:30.960 --> 13:31.960]  in Colorado.
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.960]  Um, I was pretty sure that this was the first condition we had added, but we added PTSD
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.960]  recently as well.
[13:38.960 --> 13:44.600]  Um, so huge news for folks with autism in Colorado, good news for our medical marijuana
[13:44.600 --> 13:45.600]  industry.
[13:45.600 --> 13:51.720]  Um, that has been, uh, slowly shrinking and did not existence for the last couple of years.
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.200]  Um, our rec industry has been siphoning off patients left and right.
[13:56.200 --> 14:00.240]  So the industry was happy to have another condition on the list, especially one that,
[14:00.520 --> 14:02.520]  uh, shows as much promise as autism.
[14:02.520 --> 14:03.520]  Yes, absolutely.
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.040]  It is great to have more qualifying conditions that we see some compassion coming along the
[14:07.040 --> 14:08.040]  way now.
[14:08.040 --> 14:13.080]  It was nice to have a governor that was out loud and proud about supporting this bill,
[14:13.080 --> 14:14.080]  supporting our industry.
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.920]  Um, Jared Polis is very, very pro cannabis.
[14:17.920 --> 14:19.560]  Would you like a small dab, my friend?
[14:19.560 --> 14:20.560]  No, thank you.
[14:20.560 --> 14:21.560]  All right.
[14:21.560 --> 14:22.560]  That tasted amazing.
[14:22.560 --> 14:24.480]  I will hold off for now folks.
[14:24.480 --> 14:25.480]  Save you the coffin.
[14:25.480 --> 14:26.480]  Yeah.
[14:26.480 --> 14:27.480]  He coughed for quite a while.
[14:27.480 --> 14:28.480]  Yeah.
[14:28.480 --> 14:29.480]  I'm going to go get my coffee.
[14:29.480 --> 14:30.480]  It's been here for over an hour.
[14:30.480 --> 14:32.760]  Um, let's see what's next.
[14:32.760 --> 14:33.760]  Patreon shout outs.
[14:33.760 --> 14:36.960]  We've got a lot of people who take really good care of us, who support us.
[14:36.960 --> 14:37.960]  I appreciate them.
[14:37.960 --> 14:40.200]  So I like to give them a shout out about this point of the show.
[14:40.200 --> 14:41.440]  It is a good time for that.
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.800]  Let's give a big shout out to my friend, Remy Redeye.
[14:43.800 --> 14:47.000]  How about a big shout out to Eric Ross, a giant grow from your heart.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.040]  Shout out to Eric Gorman, a shout out to Steve F of course, a shout out to farmer John, and
[14:52.040 --> 14:55.440]  always a big shout out to our friend, Sam.
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.440]  All right.
[14:58.440 --> 15:00.440]  Mike, you look like you're going to say something important.
[15:00.440 --> 15:01.440]  No, thank you folks.
[15:01.440 --> 15:03.040]  Keep it, keep it the Patreon.
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.080]  This microphone doesn't smell like donkey's ass.
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.480]  So I appreciate that.
[15:06.480 --> 15:08.440]  We should elaborate on that statement.
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.400]  The reason why the microphone cover does not smell like donkey ass is because of our friends
[15:12.400 --> 15:14.920]  from Patreon that help out with the support.
[15:14.920 --> 15:18.960]  I use that funding to buy new microphone covers so that when Mike comes over, I can frequently
[15:18.960 --> 15:22.760]  change that thing out so that he doesn't have to spit into that same microphone cover.
[15:22.760 --> 15:24.880]  Dev and Granny has used that microphone.
[15:24.880 --> 15:26.600]  Clint has been on that microphone.
[15:26.640 --> 15:28.840]  A lot of people have been spitting into that thing over the years.
[15:28.840 --> 15:32.520]  I do like to swap out these mic covers so they don't smell like other people's breath
[15:32.520 --> 15:34.640]  or donkey ass as Mike put it.
[15:34.640 --> 15:38.560]  Yeah, like 12 different hippies talking to the same microphone cover.
[15:38.560 --> 15:39.560]  Each one's spitting a little.
[15:39.560 --> 15:42.320]  After a while, it just, it gets a little funky.
[15:42.320 --> 15:44.360]  Yeah, you got to clean it just like you do the rig.
[15:44.360 --> 15:46.040]  So swap out those covers.
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.880]  And that happens because of the loyal listeners and the supporters that help us out on Patreon.
[15:50.880 --> 15:55.160]  If you want to learn how to become a patron, you can go to patreon.com slash grow from
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.160]  your heart.
[15:56.160 --> 15:58.400]  All of the information that you need will be right there on the screen.
[15:58.400 --> 16:01.720]  And again, big thanks to everyone who helps us out on Patreon.
[16:01.720 --> 16:03.280]  I do appreciate all of the support.
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.520]  All right, Mike, are you ready to move into the main topic of this hashtag?
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.640]  They like it when we ramble filled podcast.
[16:09.640 --> 16:10.640]  It's main event time.
[16:10.640 --> 16:11.640]  Let's do it.
[16:11.640 --> 16:18.520]  In Colorado, currently at this time, it is illegal to offer delivery medical marijuana
[16:18.520 --> 16:20.800]  on the legal market.
[16:20.800 --> 16:23.440]  That part of my argument is it's already happening on the black market.
[16:23.440 --> 16:30.680]  If you do legal delivery, the only thing that comes close legally is if you're a caregiver
[16:30.680 --> 16:34.560]  caring for a homebound patient and you filed paperwork with the state as such.
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.560]  Yes.
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.560]  And that had to happen during the doctor appointment.
[16:37.560 --> 16:39.440]  So there's a lot of hoops to jump through there.
[16:39.440 --> 16:40.720]  I actually saw that happen.
[16:40.720 --> 16:43.800]  I talked about going to the medical marijuana doctor on a recent episode.
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.760]  I watched somebody have to fill out their homebound paper and that was, that took them
[16:48.760 --> 16:51.720]  five times as long as it did me to get my paperwork done in that place.
[16:51.720 --> 16:52.720]  That was-
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Yeah.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  I'm not saying that's complicated.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  There's a lot of extra paperwork.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.680]  So currently, delivery is banned.
[16:57.680 --> 16:58.840]  There is no delivery allowed.
[16:58.840 --> 16:59.840]  And I'm reaching for my phone.
[16:59.840 --> 17:02.320]  Mike, if it looks like I'm playing with my phone here, I'm not playing with my phone.
[17:02.320 --> 17:05.200]  I've got notes in here and I'm just trying to be prepared.
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.480]  However, my phone, also I ordered a new phone, so I'll never have this excuse again.
[17:09.480 --> 17:11.440]  It is just straight frozen and it's taken a minute.
[17:11.440 --> 17:14.640]  Well, you won't have an excuse until the next one gets released.
[17:14.640 --> 17:16.280]  Oh, thanks.
[17:16.280 --> 17:17.280]  Conspiracy Mike over there.
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.040]  So delivery is not allowed at this point.
[17:21.040 --> 17:22.480]  There's a big debate on...
[17:23.240 --> 17:27.640]  So right now there is a bill being proposed that they do allow medical marijuana delivery.
[17:27.640 --> 17:30.480]  They want to start with medical marijuana for one year.
[17:30.480 --> 17:31.640]  They want to give it a test run.
[17:31.640 --> 17:36.840]  And then if it works, they want to introduce the delivery system to the recreational cannabis
[17:36.840 --> 17:38.320]  market.
[17:38.320 --> 17:40.120]  Some people are afraid of this.
[17:40.120 --> 17:42.120]  Some people really look forward to it.
[17:42.120 --> 17:44.520]  I thought it'd be fun to bring Mike on the show.
[17:44.520 --> 17:45.520]  Mike's kind of unprepared.
[17:45.520 --> 17:47.760]  I told him when he got here, basically what the topic was going to be.
[17:47.760 --> 17:49.560]  So he hasn't had a lot of time to research, which I like.
[17:49.560 --> 17:50.560]  He hasn't had a lot of time to prep.
[17:50.640 --> 17:53.240]  Yeah, I like it when you're just fresh and you got to rant, think off the top of your
[17:53.240 --> 17:54.240]  head.
[17:54.240 --> 17:57.160]  So it's a little better than giving you too much time to prepare.
[17:57.160 --> 17:58.160]  So let's talk about it.
[17:58.160 --> 18:01.360]  Do you think that a delivery system is a good or bad idea?
[18:01.360 --> 18:07.800]  And do you see any pros and cons to having your medical marijuana delivered?
[18:07.800 --> 18:10.080]  There's so many different takes on this.
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.320]  I think we deliver everything else.
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.640]  If I find the right app, I can get cigarettes delivered.
[18:16.640 --> 18:17.800]  I can get alcohol delivered.
[18:17.800 --> 18:20.400]  I can get my prescription medications delivered.
[18:20.400 --> 18:28.840]  I've had wine shipped to the house, like a giant fucking box of wine.
[18:28.840 --> 18:35.400]  It would have been a weird party, but there's no reason I shouldn't be able to use a delivery
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.880]  service to get cannabis delivered as well.
[18:37.880 --> 18:40.160]  I agree with that so far.
[18:40.160 --> 18:48.200]  I think most of the heat against the bill from the anti-pot crowd and the law enforcement
[18:48.200 --> 18:51.240]  community is enforcing that.
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.960]  It's going to be hard.
[18:54.960 --> 18:59.720]  There's so many different ways to skirt any sort of official rule.
[18:59.720 --> 19:05.720]  And the video requirements that we have on site in the cannabis industry help keep everybody
[19:05.720 --> 19:07.840]  on the up and up.
[19:07.840 --> 19:11.520]  It only takes one delivery boy to fuck it up for everybody.
[19:11.520 --> 19:15.920]  I bet the fines would be huge.
[19:15.920 --> 19:24.160]  The news station that sets up the sting operation where instead of just having some teenager
[19:24.160 --> 19:27.360]  answer the door and be like, no, my dad ordered it, let me sign.
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.520]  The first dude who lets them do it and gives them the fucking herb, that's a slap across
[19:32.520 --> 19:33.520]  all our faces.
[19:33.520 --> 19:34.520]  Very true.
[19:34.520 --> 19:37.400]  This is how I see that system.
[19:37.400 --> 19:39.560]  Let me touch the computer here just to keep it going.
[19:39.560 --> 19:41.040]  That screensaver makes me paranoid.
[19:41.040 --> 19:43.200]  I like to see the recording.
[19:43.200 --> 19:47.520]  How I feel it'll happen is the product will be checked out from somewhere and this is
[19:47.520 --> 19:48.840]  going to lead into one of part of my...
[19:48.840 --> 19:51.800]  So people are worried about where's the herb going to come from and it's going to put the
[19:51.800 --> 19:53.920]  dispensaries out of business.
[19:53.920 --> 19:56.680]  I think the product is going to come from the dispensary.
[19:56.680 --> 20:00.520]  It's not like the delivery service isn't going to appear and have product.
[20:00.520 --> 20:04.240]  Domino's isn't worried their driver's going to swing by Pizza Hut and pick up pizza sizzling
[20:04.240 --> 20:05.240]  on the side.
[20:05.240 --> 20:06.240]  Exactly.
[20:06.240 --> 20:08.200]  So the product is going to come from a dispensary.
[20:08.200 --> 20:10.520]  We aren't going to shut down dispensaries.
[20:10.520 --> 20:12.240]  It's not going to come from somewhere else.
[20:12.240 --> 20:13.240]  It's going to come from the dispensary.
[20:13.240 --> 20:15.480]  It has to be picked up at a dispensary.
[20:15.480 --> 20:20.520]  So the patient is probably going to have to go to the dispensary and already be registered
[20:20.520 --> 20:21.520]  there.
[20:21.520 --> 20:23.180]  You're going to have to go there and show your paperwork, show your ID.
[20:23.180 --> 20:26.200]  This is me the first time.
[20:26.200 --> 20:27.200]  Establish a connection there.
[20:27.200 --> 20:28.200]  Sign for the delivery.
[20:28.200 --> 20:33.320]  At least what I know of this bill, there's no formal system to it.
[20:33.400 --> 20:36.000]  So it could fully just be like a Grubhub app.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  Cool.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.840]  But you're going to have to prove that you're a medical marijuana patient and that you're
[20:39.840 --> 20:40.840]  old enough somehow.
[20:40.840 --> 20:46.720]  Well, for the first year under medical, but with rec, there's probably going to be a lot
[20:46.720 --> 20:47.720]  less registering.
[20:47.720 --> 20:52.000]  You'd probably just go online, create an account.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.600]  You'd probably have to scan in your driver's license or take a picture of your driver's
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.720]  license and attach it to your whatever.
[20:58.720 --> 21:03.000]  So however, then at that point, the driver will pick it up.
[21:03.680 --> 21:07.600]  And now it's on that driver's responsibility.
[21:07.600 --> 21:08.600]  He's got to pay for it somehow.
[21:08.600 --> 21:09.840]  You know what I mean?
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.000]  Dispensaries are really, that stuff's expensive.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.320]  So at the end of the day, he's either got to pay for it at the end after the trade is
[21:15.320 --> 21:18.960]  made, after he makes money and brings it back, or he's got to pay for it at the start of
[21:18.960 --> 21:20.040]  the day.
[21:20.040 --> 21:21.040]  It's got to go somewhere.
[21:21.040 --> 21:22.440]  It's got to be accounted for.
[21:22.440 --> 21:27.720]  So like you said, the only real loophole that I see where it is really going to go wrong
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.920]  is when he gives it to, like if my daughter answers the door when I'm pooping or something
[21:31.920 --> 21:33.680]  and he's like, here, you can just sign for it, little girl.
[21:33.680 --> 21:37.600]  And she signs it and sets it on the table and I smoke it later.
[21:37.600 --> 21:38.680]  That's where it's going to go wrong.
[21:38.680 --> 21:43.520]  But for the most part, I think the accountability, unless somebody wants to be shady, I think
[21:43.520 --> 21:46.080]  for the most part, it could go right if we wanted it to.
[21:46.080 --> 21:49.520]  I don't think that the deliveries will hurt the stores, like I said, because they're going
[21:49.520 --> 21:51.240]  to get it from somewhere.
[21:51.240 --> 22:00.840]  There's the worry from the industry that I've read about is that a couple of chains or an
[22:00.840 --> 22:08.720]  independent delivery service will dominate that particular piece of the market.
[22:08.720 --> 22:10.280]  It's kind of a silly worry.
[22:10.280 --> 22:15.160]  And they let Walmart dominate that particular piece of the market.
[22:15.160 --> 22:17.880]  They let Best Buy dominate that part.
[22:17.880 --> 22:19.680]  That's how shit goes when it becomes business.
[22:19.680 --> 22:27.840]  There's a handful of really large chains in Colorado and the independent operators have
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.440]  trouble competing with the larger chains because the larger chains are the only ones
[22:32.440 --> 22:39.440]  that have the cashflow size to really advertise a specific brand.
[22:39.440 --> 22:44.000]  Like a lot of the smaller stores that we have in town, they haven't heard of in Springs.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.520]  And just like we haven't heard of a lot of the smaller ones in Springs or a lot of the
[22:47.520 --> 22:52.480]  smaller ones in Trinidad, the city south of here, they just don't have that level of marketing
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.480]  budget.
[22:53.480 --> 23:00.720]  And they're worried that one of the big chains will have a delivery service that won't operate
[23:00.720 --> 23:07.920]  with the small time operators, that the deliveries that customers will be able to get will predominantly
[23:07.920 --> 23:10.000]  be from the big chains.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  And so the people who are adamant about getting their herb delivered will end up by default
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.240]  shopping with the big guy rather than the little guy.
[23:20.240 --> 23:21.520]  It's kind of a silly fear.
[23:21.520 --> 23:22.520]  That's true.
[23:22.520 --> 23:26.600]  That was going to be my next thing.
[23:26.600 --> 23:30.280]  So I would, would you use a delivery system?
[23:30.280 --> 23:31.280]  Depending on the system?
[23:31.280 --> 23:32.280]  Fuck yeah.
[23:32.280 --> 23:33.280]  You've got two kids at home.
[23:33.280 --> 23:34.280]  I mean.
[23:34.280 --> 23:35.600]  No, there's finding time to go to the dispensaries.
[23:35.600 --> 23:37.600]  Pain in the ass.
[23:37.600 --> 23:38.920]  Sometimes it is.
[23:38.920 --> 23:42.400]  On Monday, I generally like to shop at the dispensary on Monday.
[23:42.400 --> 23:43.440]  It's dead on Mondays.
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.360]  It's a really good day to go to the dispensary.
[23:45.360 --> 23:49.960]  So I'll stop in on Monday and I will get my, I try to get my supply that will last me until
[23:49.960 --> 23:50.960]  about Thursday.
[23:51.400 --> 23:53.520]  I don't want to go Thursday because I don't want to go Friday, Saturday or Sunday.
[23:53.520 --> 23:54.880]  That kind of sucks for the dispensary.
[23:54.880 --> 23:56.160]  If you've got the option, don't go.
[23:56.160 --> 23:57.840]  It's just the busiest.
[23:57.840 --> 23:59.440]  Thursdays are cool.
[23:59.440 --> 24:00.440]  People don't get paid till Friday.
[24:00.440 --> 24:04.020]  So Thursday you beat, you jump the gun, go in there and get what you need for the weekend.
[24:04.020 --> 24:06.440]  So Monday and Thursday are my favorite days to go.
[24:06.440 --> 24:10.720]  If I went Monday, I would take a good look at all the product, see what they've got,
[24:10.720 --> 24:14.440]  give it a good once over, make a nice selection, make a mental note of what I want to try next
[24:14.440 --> 24:15.440]  time.
[24:15.440 --> 24:18.240]  And then Thursday, if I don't really feel like putting on shoes and driving all the
[24:18.240 --> 24:22.240]  way over the dispensary, or if I just simply don't have time, I may just take that delivery
[24:22.240 --> 24:23.900]  of my last order.
[24:23.900 --> 24:24.900]  Exactly what I got.
[24:24.900 --> 24:25.900]  You know what I mean?
[24:25.900 --> 24:26.900]  Just remember what I got.
[24:26.900 --> 24:29.520]  The bud tender probably has a computer or something, or you could just text it or whatever,
[24:29.520 --> 24:30.520]  however you do.
[24:30.520 --> 24:33.600]  And then, or maybe order that other one I was looking at.
[24:33.600 --> 24:35.520]  We have the tech to make it super easy.
[24:35.520 --> 24:39.360]  Yeah, I can jump on with a, with a little work on the shops and to keep their online
[24:39.360 --> 24:40.360]  menu current.
[24:40.360 --> 24:41.360]  Yeah.
[24:41.360 --> 24:44.920]  I just jumped on a couple of shops before I even leave the house while I'm pooping in
[24:44.920 --> 24:45.920]  the morning.
[24:46.600 --> 24:49.600]  I had weed maps and a couple other websites to see who's got what I want to go shop for
[24:49.600 --> 24:50.600]  today.
[24:50.600 --> 24:52.480]  And then I already know where I'm going and what I'm getting when I get there.
[24:52.480 --> 24:53.720]  So it makes it real easy.
[24:53.720 --> 24:56.520]  Most shops have that component taken care of.
[24:56.520 --> 25:06.520]  What we really need to make a delivery system safe and functional is banking access.
[25:06.520 --> 25:07.520]  Yes.
[25:07.520 --> 25:10.080]  Like every shop needs to be able to take all major credit cards.
[25:10.080 --> 25:11.080]  That would be nice.
[25:11.080 --> 25:13.680]  Just like every other business.
[25:13.680 --> 25:17.600]  And that would solve a couple of the problems with this system because right now you're
[25:17.600 --> 25:18.600]  totally right.
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.640]  Like you're going to have to go into the shop.
[25:20.640 --> 25:26.160]  You're probably going to have to do a couple of things way above and beyond what you'd
[25:26.160 --> 25:34.200]  have to do to get your prescription meds or alcohol delivered to your house.
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.600]  And they're starting with medical first, which will give a real slow rollout to this.
[25:38.600 --> 25:39.600]  Yeah.
[25:39.600 --> 25:41.680]  It makes it easy to test it though.
[25:41.680 --> 25:43.120]  So I would take that midweek delivery.
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.880]  I think I would just say, send me that order in the middle of the week.
[25:45.880 --> 25:46.880]  I like to go look.
[25:46.880 --> 25:48.360]  So they think it's going to hurt business.
[25:48.360 --> 25:50.880]  I don't think it would hurt business because I like to go look.
[25:50.880 --> 25:53.080]  People want to see their product.
[25:53.080 --> 25:54.080]  That's not the whole industry.
[25:54.080 --> 25:55.920]  It's just a little piece of it.
[25:55.920 --> 26:01.600]  Honestly, the part that worries me is delivery drivers are going to be sitting ducks, like
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.480]  just bad, easy targets.
[26:06.480 --> 26:11.040]  If they mark themselves, if nobody, if they just pull up in a Ford Escape and a t-shirt
[26:11.040 --> 26:13.040]  and Dickies, nobody knows who they are.
[26:13.040 --> 26:14.040]  Fair.
[26:14.040 --> 26:15.040]  But, uh,
[26:15.040 --> 26:16.560]  We're in a Jimmy John's uniform.
[26:16.560 --> 26:20.760]  Nobody gives a shit about the Jimmy John's guy.
[26:20.760 --> 26:24.720]  But the Jimmy John's guy gets jacked from time to time because people know he's got
[26:24.720 --> 26:26.920]  50, 60 bucks in change on him.
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.760]  No, they usually, that's why I said Jimmy John's because they go back and forth so quick.
[26:29.760 --> 26:30.760]  They only have like 12 bucks.
[26:30.760 --> 26:33.440]  Their orders are pretty cheap.
[26:33.440 --> 26:38.000]  But there's plenty of places where delivery drivers, like shit, I've lived in neighborhoods
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.400]  in Pueblo where places won't straight won't deliver.
[26:41.400 --> 26:45.560]  Because I've had so many problems of, uh, with their drivers in those areas.
[26:45.560 --> 26:46.880]  That's Pueblo for you.
[26:46.880 --> 26:52.600]  So I think our deliveries, you guys would have a slightly more, slightly more problems
[26:52.600 --> 26:53.920]  than your average delivery driver.
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.920]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[26:54.920 --> 26:55.920]  You got to go.
[26:55.920 --> 26:58.840]  That's why I was thinking you have to go to the dispensary and register.
[26:58.840 --> 27:00.440]  That way you're like, Hey, here's my name.
[27:00.440 --> 27:01.440]  Here's my ID.
[27:01.440 --> 27:03.780]  Here's the, you only get one address to deliver to.
[27:03.780 --> 27:06.880]  And then that would, they know you got to call and be like, Hey, it's me.
[27:06.880 --> 27:07.880]  Here's my address.
[27:07.880 --> 27:08.880]  It's got to go.
[27:08.880 --> 27:12.920]  So I guess I'm just substantially more creative than your average, which is good.
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.400]  That's why I call you sometimes when I'm like, Hey Mike, that's why I call you for that stuff.
[27:18.400 --> 27:21.960]  But yeah, if we had banking, I think this would be a pretty simple system.
[27:21.960 --> 27:26.640]  Um, and easily trackable and, and keep to keep it on the up and up.
[27:26.640 --> 27:28.120]  But I don't know.
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.960]  I don't see it passing in Colorado this year.
[27:29.960 --> 27:30.960]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.000]  I think it would increase dispensary sales.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.160]  I think it would increase some.
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.320]  And that's honestly the best argument for having this system now is, is to take another
[27:39.320 --> 27:40.520]  swipe at the black market.
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.760]  I've got one real good argument, but I'm trying to save it for the very end.
[27:44.760 --> 27:47.840]  Ooh, the black market delivers.
[27:47.840 --> 27:49.480]  That's not even my, my ace in the hole.
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.360]  The black market delivers all day.
[27:51.360 --> 27:52.760]  You can get a black market delivery.
[27:52.760 --> 27:54.580]  So, uh, they're delivering.
[27:54.580 --> 27:58.400]  And if you want to corner the market, that's the one big piece that they're missing.
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.800]  Uh, man, how many sick days have you had?
[28:00.800 --> 28:02.440]  What if, what if you got explosive diarrhea?
[28:02.440 --> 28:04.040]  You don't want me at the dispensary.
[28:04.040 --> 28:05.480]  You don't want me standing in line.
[28:05.480 --> 28:06.480]  What if I'm sick?
[28:06.480 --> 28:07.720]  You don't want me smelling the jars.
[28:07.720 --> 28:09.280]  You'd rather just bring me the eighth.
[28:09.280 --> 28:12.280]  Just bring me a quarter of some good weed so I could smoke a couple of bowls and go
[28:12.280 --> 28:13.280]  back to bed.
[28:13.280 --> 28:15.960]  Like, yeah, I think that that's a good advantage.
[28:15.960 --> 28:18.840]  What about, uh, you got two kids, man.
[28:18.840 --> 28:20.360]  Like I was saying earlier, you can't get away.
[28:20.360 --> 28:24.840]  No, it's, I mean, honestly, it's a pain in the ass cause you can't like any other store.
[28:24.840 --> 28:27.920]  I can just put my kid in the cart and be like, don't touch the stuff.
[28:27.920 --> 28:28.920]  Yeah.
[28:28.920 --> 28:32.120]  Cause like, I don't want them grabbing at the teddy bears or the Christmas cards or
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.120]  anything else.
[28:33.200 --> 28:36.840]  Like, and there's usually not even shit to grab at a dispensary, but you're not allowed
[28:36.840 --> 28:38.240]  to take your kids in.
[28:38.240 --> 28:44.320]  You're also like a, if you're a decent person in like CPS, if they found out would definitely
[28:44.320 --> 28:49.120]  not appreciate just leaving the kids in the parking lot for fucking 40 minutes while I'm
[28:49.120 --> 28:51.240]  waiting in line and waiting to shop.
[28:51.240 --> 28:55.400]  And they do, they're way too young for that shit.
[28:55.400 --> 29:00.200]  So at minimum I have to either have someone to watch the kids or someone to sit in the
[29:00.200 --> 29:01.200]  car with the kids.
[29:01.320 --> 29:02.320]  And there's two of them.
[29:02.320 --> 29:04.320]  And so they're going to murder each other.
[29:04.320 --> 29:05.600]  There's an S at the end of that.
[29:05.600 --> 29:06.600]  Yeah.
[29:06.600 --> 29:07.600]  That's mischief.
[29:07.600 --> 29:09.920]  Um, and so it's just kind of a pain.
[29:09.920 --> 29:11.400]  Like I have to find a good spot to do it.
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.800]  So when I go to the dispensary now I'm getting like three or four weeks worth of product
[29:15.800 --> 29:20.320]  just so that I don't have to figure out how to get away for another hour and 40 again
[29:20.320 --> 29:21.320]  during business hours.
[29:21.320 --> 29:25.000]  During, but yeah, during like this, the podcast happens late at night, folks is the only way
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.520]  we're able to get this done.
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.680]  What's wacky to me is that if we go to apothecary, the dispensary four and a half miles from
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.760]  here, they have one entrance where you walk into the lobby and then you see the reception
[29:34.760 --> 29:36.600]  person, uh, the intake person.
[29:36.600 --> 29:38.160]  I don't know the appropriate word for that.
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.160]  It's 2019.
[29:39.160 --> 29:40.840]  I'm sure that there's a better word now.
[29:40.840 --> 29:42.360]  I'm trying to use it.
[29:42.360 --> 29:43.360]  Whatever word that is.
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.320]  You walk in, you say hi to the marvelous person that greets you.
[29:46.320 --> 29:48.920]  And then you either are a medical or a recreational shopper.
[29:48.920 --> 29:50.760]  If you're rec, you go on one side of the store.
[29:50.760 --> 29:53.120]  If you're a medical, you go on the other side of the store.
[29:53.120 --> 29:55.080]  It's two different shopping experiences.
[29:55.080 --> 30:00.640]  Uh, for some reason we have voted that the medical side is open until 7 PM and the recreational
[30:00.640 --> 30:02.880]  side is open until 11.
[30:02.880 --> 30:07.280]  So if I smoke cannabis after seven, I'm like a fucking gremlin, right?
[30:07.280 --> 30:08.280]  It's like a mogwai.
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.280]  It becomes recreational.
[30:09.280 --> 30:13.960]  If I start smoking weed after seven o'clock and I get high, but if I smoke it before seven,
[30:13.960 --> 30:15.680]  then I'm just medicating.
[30:15.680 --> 30:17.400]  I don't know why those rules are different.
[30:17.400 --> 30:18.800]  I think it's pretty funny.
[30:18.800 --> 30:19.800]  It's kind of silly.
[30:19.800 --> 30:20.800]  Yeah.
[30:20.800 --> 30:21.800]  I find it silly.
[30:21.800 --> 30:22.800]  Yup.
[30:22.800 --> 30:27.800]  It's a, it's those little, little tidbits that I'm useful for.
[30:28.800 --> 30:32.200]  I was going to say at least you're useful for something, but I didn't want to have to
[30:32.200 --> 30:33.200]  edit that out of the show.
[30:33.200 --> 30:35.640]  There's a bunch of other marijuana bills going on in Colorado.
[30:35.640 --> 30:39.440]  Um, odds are there's several marijuana bills going on in your state.
[30:39.440 --> 30:42.920]  Um, if you'd like us to cover one, shoot me a message on Twitter.
[30:42.920 --> 30:43.920]  There you go.
[30:43.920 --> 30:44.920]  Send Mike a Twitter message.
[30:44.920 --> 30:45.920]  It's at Nemo punk 15.
[30:45.920 --> 30:48.920]  I haven't given him the opportunity to plug himself yet, but now's a good time.
[30:48.920 --> 30:50.720]  Let's talk about your social media.
[30:50.720 --> 30:53.120]  There's at Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter.
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.240]  And then what's the other one?
[30:54.240 --> 30:56.400]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[30:56.400 --> 30:57.400]  Yup.
[30:58.000 --> 30:59.000]  Yeah.
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.000]  See, I've been doing my best to remember that one.
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.480]  Make sure you support Mike's Facebook page, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[31:02.480 --> 31:07.120]  He posts a lot of good cannabis rants, lots of good news to keep you, keep you up to date
[31:07.120 --> 31:08.120]  and informed.
[31:08.120 --> 31:09.120]  It will keep you updated.
[31:09.120 --> 31:13.320]  You're going to post any pictures of your France trip on that page?
[31:13.320 --> 31:14.320]  Probably not.
[31:14.320 --> 31:15.320]  Maybe.
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.320]  Probably not.
[31:16.320 --> 31:17.320]  Maybe.
[31:17.320 --> 31:18.320]  I doubt it.
[31:18.320 --> 31:19.320]  I'm lazy.
[31:19.320 --> 31:23.000]  If, uh, if people are like post photos on your, your cannabis social media, I may.
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  There you go.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  Uh, speaking of photos, even planning on talking about that, when you asked me, I was surprised,
[31:27.600 --> 31:31.000]  but yeah, that's why I sound like I'm, I'm half asleep or overglazed folks.
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.000]  I'm just exhausted.
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.000]  No, thanks for coming, bro.
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.480]  Thanks for coming and hanging out with us.
[31:34.480 --> 31:35.480]  Oh yeah.
[31:35.480 --> 31:39.520]  If you guys are looking for my Instagram, uh, Instagram has shut down my account.
[31:39.520 --> 31:41.360]  Um, I'm going to do my best to get it back.
[31:41.360 --> 31:42.360]  I make no promises.
[31:42.360 --> 31:44.680]  If I don't get it back, I may make another one.
[31:44.680 --> 31:45.680]  I may not.
[31:45.680 --> 31:46.680]  I don't know.
[31:46.680 --> 31:51.720]  It's been kind of nice, uh, not opening my phone to check my Instagram every 30 minutes.
[31:51.720 --> 31:52.720]  I do miss it.
[31:52.720 --> 31:55.120]  I miss all of my friends that I was communicating with.
[31:55.120 --> 31:59.320]  Also there are about 500 direct messages now that I'm like, Oh, I don't have to answer
[31:59.320 --> 32:01.320]  those not to be a dick.
[32:01.320 --> 32:03.520]  That was a lot of messages to try to keep up with.
[32:03.520 --> 32:04.520]  Oh my goodness.
[32:04.520 --> 32:07.280]  When you get like a hundred messages a day and you're just trying to field them, you're
[32:07.280 --> 32:08.560]  like, hi, I'm not ignoring you.
[32:08.560 --> 32:10.520]  I'm just, I only poop so often.
[32:10.520 --> 32:12.320]  So I only have so much time to read these messages.
[32:12.320 --> 32:14.240]  Like it was, it was a lot to look at.
[32:14.240 --> 32:18.280]  Oh, and by the way, did you realize it only takes you like four or five minutes to poop
[32:18.280 --> 32:23.880]  if you don't have Instagram, your legs don't go numb on the toilet without Instagram.
[32:23.880 --> 32:27.080]  That's just a weird phenomenon I just discovered.
[32:27.080 --> 32:28.480]  I've got other apps.
[32:28.480 --> 32:29.480]  Yeah, right.
[32:29.480 --> 32:30.480]  Yeah.
[32:30.480 --> 32:31.480]  Okay.
[32:31.480 --> 32:32.480]  Uh, Mike, thanks for hanging out.
[32:32.480 --> 32:35.880]  I'm just going to skip that the best I can.
[32:35.880 --> 32:36.880]  Thanks for hanging out, bro.
[32:36.880 --> 32:40.440]  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, thank you guys for hanging out.

[32:52.920 --> 32:53.920]  other word I used to use?
[32:53.920 --> 32:55.040]  And I think that's all that I used to say.

[33:20.240 --> 33:21.640]  420 is coming up.
[33:21.640 --> 33:23.720]  What does 420 mean to you?
[33:23.720 --> 33:24.720]  Somebody asked, do you mean the number?
[33:24.720 --> 33:25.720]  Do you mean the time?
[33:25.720 --> 33:26.720]  Or do you mean the date?
[33:26.720 --> 33:27.720]  I don't mean anything.
[33:27.720 --> 33:29.000]  I mean, what does it mean to you?
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  You tell me what it means.
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  That's what I'm asking.
[33:31.000 --> 33:32.400]  What does 420 mean to you?
[33:32.400 --> 33:33.600]  You define it in your way.

[33:39.640 --> 33:40.640]  you to so many characters.

[34:05.440 --> 34:08.920]  Mike, you got any words of wisdom before we wrap up this podcast?
[34:08.920 --> 34:09.920]  Nope.
[34:09.920 --> 34:12.960]  Dude, you're just staring off into space over there.
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.840]  What were you even- Had I known you were going to ask about
[34:15.840 --> 34:18.240]  words of wisdom at the end of the show, I might've had some.
[34:18.240 --> 34:20.800]  We're going to start doing some Mike's moments.
[34:21.360 --> 34:22.360]  Some Jerry's final thoughts.
[34:22.360 --> 34:23.360]  Jerry's final thoughts.
[34:23.360 --> 34:24.360]  Exactly, exactly.
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.360]  Yep.
