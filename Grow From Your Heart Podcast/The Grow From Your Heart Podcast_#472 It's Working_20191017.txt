[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.720 --> 00:06.160]  Welcome to episode 472 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.160 --> 00:09.960]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.960 --> 00:14.960]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:14.960 --> 00:22.880]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.880 --> 00:26.840]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.840 --> 00:31.000]  This evening, I've been smoking Dogfighter, full spectrum extract from our friends at
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.380]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:32.380 --> 00:35.660]  This is a blend of Starfighter and Star Dog.
[00:35.660 --> 00:39.340]  On the label, the flavor is described as sour, fruit, and fuel.
[00:39.340 --> 00:41.640]  I would definitely agree with the fruity fuel part.
[00:41.640 --> 00:44.160]  I'm not sure I get the sour.
[00:44.160 --> 00:46.000]  Still a delicious and impressive concentrate.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.740]  I'm going to bust it open so I can talk about the appearance and consistency.
[00:49.740 --> 00:52.920]  There are three perfect dab-sized diamonds in here.
[00:52.920 --> 00:54.680]  There were four or five diamonds in here.
[00:54.680 --> 00:56.080]  I am not going to crush them up.
[00:56.320 --> 00:58.280]  I'm going to take them as individual dabs.
[00:58.280 --> 01:00.760]  That means that this gram will be five dabs.
[01:00.760 --> 01:03.800]  There's just enough Terp sauce in here to make it delicious.
[01:03.800 --> 01:10.480]  On the back of the container, it says that this product does contain 60.95% THC, non-detectable
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.880]  amounts of CBD.
[01:11.880 --> 01:16.600]  I am sure that the remainder of that percentage is mostly terpenes.
[01:16.600 --> 01:20.160]  This product smells delicious and ridiculous.
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.080]  A big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the impressive Dogfighter full spectrum
[01:26.080 --> 01:27.080]  extract.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.880]  All right, Podcast World.
[01:28.880 --> 01:35.080]  In this episode, I'm going to read some customer reviews from the Apple Podcast application.
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.120]  Before I get there, I would like to do some shout outs to a few of our friends from Patreon.
[01:40.120 --> 01:43.120]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to JM?
[01:43.120 --> 01:45.320]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Blackbird.
[01:45.320 --> 01:49.720]  Also, a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to Tyler R. How about
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.720]  a big fist bump and a shout out to our friend Justin?
[01:52.720 --> 01:57.480]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Zoso J. Of course, I want to
[01:57.480 --> 02:00.800]  send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out, fist bump, and thank you to our
[02:00.800 --> 02:02.880]  friends down at Hogan's Farms.
[02:02.880 --> 02:07.640]  Of course, a big shout out to Richard M. I always want to send a shout out to Darren W.
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.560]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:12.560 --> 02:16.960]  shout out, thank you, and a fist bump to our friend David OQ.
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.120]  And again, big giant thanks to everybody who has supported the show on Patreon.
[02:21.120 --> 02:27.360]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[02:27.360 --> 02:29.520]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.200]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:34.200 --> 02:37.480]  At the start of the show, I did say I was going to read some customer reviews from the
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.960]  Apple Podcast application.
[02:39.960 --> 02:42.480]  Before I get there, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.320]  There is a new update for my computer and my computer recording software and my recording
[02:47.320 --> 02:49.600]  hardware are not getting along today.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.040]  They just don't want to be friends.
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.560]  I've restarted both devices a couple of times.
[02:53.560 --> 02:55.560]  I've tried to download patches.
[02:55.560 --> 02:58.140]  These devices want to butt heads.
[02:58.140 --> 02:59.200]  There may be some glitches.
[02:59.200 --> 03:01.580]  There may be some weird editing points in the show.
[03:01.580 --> 03:04.800]  I do apologize in advance if there is any weirdness.
[03:04.800 --> 03:09.940]  I thought I would use this episode to read Apple Podcast application customer ratings
[03:09.940 --> 03:14.780]  and reviews instead of trying to put out a grow lesson that may possibly have errors
[03:14.780 --> 03:15.780]  in the episode.
[03:15.780 --> 03:20.420]  So, I'm going to use this episode, this recording session, this editing session to figure out
[03:20.420 --> 03:24.420]  what is going on with this software so that I can bring to you a quality grow lesson in
[03:24.420 --> 03:25.420]  the next episode.
[03:25.420 --> 03:31.180]  So, ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's jump right into some Apple Podcast
[03:31.180 --> 03:35.100]  application customer ratings and reviews.
[03:35.100 --> 03:39.100]  If you are listening to the podcast on the Apple Podcast application and you would like
[03:39.260 --> 03:42.380]  to leave a review on the show, it is really easy.
[03:42.380 --> 03:43.540]  Simply open up the podcast.
[03:43.540 --> 03:47.040]  However you listen to it, if you're using your Apple iPad or your iPhone, you probably
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.660]  open the podcast application.
[03:49.660 --> 03:50.660]  Open that.
[03:50.660 --> 03:52.020]  Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:52.020 --> 03:53.020]  Open that.
[03:53.020 --> 03:54.660]  Scroll to the available episodes.
[03:54.660 --> 03:58.540]  Keep scrolling right after that and then it will show you customer ratings and reviews.
[03:58.540 --> 04:03.720]  It will give you an opportunity to click on an amount of stars which you feel I deserve.
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.540]  So far, everybody has given the show five stars.
[04:06.540 --> 04:10.180]  Many reviews that were not five stars have been deleted because they were deemed to be
[04:10.180 --> 04:11.940]  spam and spiteful.
[04:11.940 --> 04:15.340]  So we are standing at nothing but five star reviews at this point.
[04:15.340 --> 04:18.420]  But click the amount of stars which you feel I deserve.
[04:18.420 --> 04:22.900]  Then leave a review about the podcast and let other people know what you think about
[04:22.900 --> 04:23.980]  the show.
[04:23.980 --> 04:28.460]  I'm going to jump right into the first Apple Podcast customer review of this episode.
[04:28.460 --> 04:29.860]  I may have read this one already.
[04:29.860 --> 04:32.340]  Honestly, I don't remember the last review I read.
[04:32.340 --> 04:38.300]  This one came in on August 6th from a person who calls themselves IryArmy619.
[04:38.300 --> 04:40.300]  They gave us a five star rating.
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.460]  I cannot read the full headline of the review.
[04:42.460 --> 04:45.260]  It starts off with, great show, listen and learn.
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.180]  Then the thing gets cut off here.
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.180]  But then it continues.
[04:48.180 --> 04:49.180]  There is a full review.
[04:49.180 --> 04:51.260]  It says, Rastajef is the man.
[04:51.260 --> 04:55.380]  His love for the plant and cannabis community are very evident in every episode.
[04:55.380 --> 04:57.140]  Man, that means a lot to me already.
[04:57.140 --> 04:58.220]  This is a great review.
[04:58.220 --> 05:01.300]  The whole podcast oozes passion and knowledge.
[05:01.300 --> 05:02.660]  I appreciate that.
[05:02.660 --> 05:07.140]  Both new growers and experienced growers can learn something from Rastajef and the Grow
[05:07.140 --> 05:08.140]  From Your Heart Podcast.
[05:08.140 --> 05:09.500]  Man, that is my exact goal.
[05:09.500 --> 05:11.100]  I'm trying to teach the new growers.
[05:11.100 --> 05:14.700]  I'm trying to keep the experienced growers entertained while I'm doing it and remind
[05:14.700 --> 05:15.940]  them of their roots.
[05:15.940 --> 05:18.660]  So I'm hitting my target, which means a lot to me.
[05:18.660 --> 05:23.340]  He keeps going by saying, keep bringing the amazing content and I promise to keep listening
[05:23.340 --> 05:24.420]  and sharing the podcast.
[05:24.420 --> 05:25.780]  Hey, I appreciate that.
[05:25.780 --> 05:27.820]  Tell your friends about the show, you guys.
[05:27.820 --> 05:29.060]  He goes on to say, P.S.
[05:29.060 --> 05:34.820]  If possible, please bring more content about outdoor growing for our friends in the sun.
[05:34.820 --> 05:35.820]  I appreciate that.
[05:35.820 --> 05:39.940]  I am not the most experienced outdoor gardener, so I do need to get some friends on here.
[05:39.940 --> 05:41.820]  It is actually harvest season at this point.
[05:41.820 --> 05:45.940]  So maybe by next year, we can get some outdoor growers to come on here.
[05:45.940 --> 05:49.020]  Jesse has spent most of the grow season in Mexico.
[05:49.020 --> 05:50.020]  Well-deserved.
[05:50.020 --> 05:51.860]  So big shout out to our buddy Jesse.
[05:51.860 --> 05:56.500]  When he is back, maybe we will get him on the podcast to do a little outdoor grow lesson.
[05:56.980 --> 05:58.620]  Hey, thank you for the great review.
[05:58.620 --> 06:00.260]  Thank you for the five stars.
[06:00.260 --> 06:01.260]  Let's keep moving.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.700]  I'm trying to open up the next review now.
[06:02.700 --> 06:06.940]  I don't like the way that this application works now, but we are going to work with it.
[06:06.940 --> 06:07.940]  I'm clicking, I'm clicking.
[06:07.940 --> 06:10.300]  This one was left on August 19th.
[06:10.300 --> 06:12.420]  This person calls themselves Dawn Grower.
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.940]  They left us a five-star review.
[06:14.940 --> 06:19.340]  The headline says, an awesome podcast and easy, but then they cut off the headlines
[06:19.340 --> 06:21.860]  on the new application, so you can't see the rest of that.
[06:21.860 --> 06:23.580]  However, we can read the full review.
[06:23.580 --> 06:29.020]  It goes on to say, Jeff, great show, love the podcast and all of the positivity and
[06:29.020 --> 06:30.020]  great advice.
[06:30.020 --> 06:32.260]  My wife and I are in Colorado Springs.
[06:32.260 --> 06:33.260]  Come by sometime.
[06:33.260 --> 06:34.260]  Cheers.
[06:34.260 --> 06:35.540]  Hey, I like that, Dawn the Grower.
[06:35.540 --> 06:37.500]  I am in Colorado Springs quite frequently.
[06:37.500 --> 06:41.700]  We will have to link up on social media so that I can stop by and dab you out, check
[06:41.700 --> 06:45.700]  out your garden and leave some seeds so that you can grow some ivory genetics up there
[06:45.700 --> 06:47.420]  in Colorado Springs.
[06:47.420 --> 06:48.740]  I want to thank you for the great review.
[06:48.740 --> 06:52.740]  I want to thank you for the five-star rating, and I look forward to hanging out at some
[06:52.900 --> 06:54.700]  Colorado Springs dab event.
[06:54.700 --> 06:57.380]  All right, we're going to keep on moving.
[06:57.380 --> 07:03.060]  This next review was left on September 3rd by a person who calls themselves Levi Sun.
[07:03.060 --> 07:04.260]  Their headline was nice and short.
[07:04.260 --> 07:06.580]  It says, awesome podcast.
[07:06.580 --> 07:08.940]  They did give us a five-star rating.
[07:08.940 --> 07:12.620]  The review goes a lot like this.
[07:12.620 --> 07:14.380]  I love your podcast.
[07:14.380 --> 07:15.660]  Super helpful.
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.900]  When I listen to the Grow Lessons, I take notes.
[07:17.900 --> 07:20.780]  I have to refresh the page because the review just disappeared.
[07:20.780 --> 07:21.780]  There we go.
[07:21.820 --> 07:22.820]  I'm going to keep on going.
[07:22.820 --> 07:25.540]  It says, I take notes, lots of info.
[07:25.540 --> 07:26.940]  Don't stop making podcasts.
[07:26.940 --> 07:30.540]  You're full of knowledge, and it's always great to hear someone new.
[07:30.540 --> 07:31.540]  And don't give up.
[07:31.540 --> 07:35.420]  I want to be listening until you get to episode 1,000.
[07:35.420 --> 07:38.820]  While 1,000 episodes would be cool, I'm almost up to 500.
[07:38.820 --> 07:39.980]  I think I'm about 25 away.
[07:39.980 --> 07:41.820]  I don't remember what number we're on here.
[07:41.820 --> 07:42.820]  25.
[07:42.820 --> 07:45.540]  I'm 28 episodes away from being at 500.
[07:45.540 --> 07:47.540]  I think 1,000 is a reasonable goal.
[07:47.540 --> 07:51.180]  I do not see a reason to stop recording or making podcasts.
[07:51.180 --> 07:54.780]  As long as people keep listening, as long as the service is still available, as long
[07:54.780 --> 07:58.300]  as they don't make some weird legal thing or some changes to podcasts where they have
[07:58.300 --> 08:03.380]  to be paid for or I have to pay to do it, then we should keep the show going forever.
[08:03.380 --> 08:04.580]  I don't see a reason to stop.
[08:04.580 --> 08:08.500]  And even if they do make me pay to produce podcasts, I will still do it because you guys
[08:08.500 --> 08:12.380]  support me quite well, and you've supported me for so long that I would still continue
[08:12.380 --> 08:14.820]  to do it, even if it did cost me a little bit.
[08:14.820 --> 08:19.340]  It does cost me a little, of course, to host the website, to have all the equipment and
[08:19.340 --> 08:21.300]  all that, but Patreon covers that.
[08:21.300 --> 08:22.300]  So thank you.
[08:22.300 --> 08:23.300]  I want to keep going with this review.
[08:23.300 --> 08:24.300]  Let's get back into it.
[08:24.300 --> 08:27.700]  It says, I hope you don't give up and keep it up.
[08:27.700 --> 08:29.540]  I do not plan on giving it up.
[08:29.540 --> 08:31.680]  There is no reason to give up podcasting.
[08:31.680 --> 08:32.680]  This is fun.
[08:32.680 --> 08:34.400]  I've got a lot of passion for this.
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.700]  And then every episode I put out, I get at least 12 or 15 replies on YouTube from people
[08:39.700 --> 08:41.260]  saying great job.
[08:41.260 --> 08:42.260]  Thanks for all of the help.
[08:42.260 --> 08:45.300]  And then I get a bunch of emails from people saying, wow, you really solved my problem
[08:45.300 --> 08:46.300]  and my grow.
[08:46.300 --> 08:47.420]  It is very rewarding.
[08:47.420 --> 08:49.660]  So there is no reason to stop doing the show.
[08:49.660 --> 08:51.220]  I am fucking rambly.
[08:51.220 --> 08:52.220]  Let's keep going.
[08:52.220 --> 08:53.680]  We've got some more reviews to get through.
[08:53.680 --> 09:00.500]  This one was left on September 16th of 2019 by a person who calls themselves Dean221.
[09:00.500 --> 09:02.140]  The headline is great.
[09:02.140 --> 09:05.520]  I like that because it fits in a little short spot they give you now.
[09:05.520 --> 09:07.580]  But our new friend gave us a five star rating.
[09:07.580 --> 09:08.740]  I am opening the review.
[09:08.980 --> 09:12.320]  I have to refresh the screen again because for some reason the reviews disappear once
[09:12.320 --> 09:13.320]  you click on them.
[09:13.320 --> 09:15.660]  You got to unclick and click something else and then go back to it.
[09:15.660 --> 09:16.900]  That review is still not there.
[09:16.900 --> 09:19.260]  There's a blank space where the review used to be.
[09:19.260 --> 09:20.260]  There we go.
[09:20.260 --> 09:21.260]  It just popped back up.
[09:21.260 --> 09:24.140]  I know I sound crazy, but if you're playing with the Apple podcast application, you'll
[09:24.140 --> 09:25.140]  see what I'm talking about.
[09:25.140 --> 09:26.860]  The new update is a little weird.
[09:26.860 --> 09:29.580]  That's why we're doing a test run with this episode.
[09:29.580 --> 09:33.660]  So it says most informative and entertaining grow show ever.
[09:33.660 --> 09:34.900]  I appreciate that.
[09:34.900 --> 09:36.460]  Rastajef is my hero.
[09:36.460 --> 09:37.460]  That's fucking cool.
[09:37.460 --> 09:38.460]  Thank you.
[09:39.180 --> 09:40.580]  Ah, that's kind of scary, but I do appreciate it.
[09:40.580 --> 09:46.020]  It also says I'm brand new to stealth growing personal medicine and I listen constantly.
[09:46.020 --> 09:49.180]  I'm 63 and I feel born again.
[09:49.180 --> 09:50.180]  Thanks Rastajef.
[09:50.180 --> 09:51.420]  Man, that is kind of cool.
[09:51.420 --> 09:53.820]  Ah, 63 and feels born again.
[09:53.820 --> 09:57.300]  Thanks to this podcast and to being able to grow personal cannabis.
[09:57.300 --> 09:58.300]  That is fucking cool.
[09:58.300 --> 09:59.300]  I appreciate that.
[09:59.300 --> 10:00.660]  That's my favorite review of the day.
[10:00.660 --> 10:04.760]  It goes on to say, I want to reiterate, Jeff is so interesting.
[10:04.760 --> 10:08.060]  Just checking to see if I can get Jeff another good review.
[10:08.660 --> 10:11.260]  He is a fascinating listen best ever.
[10:11.260 --> 10:12.260]  Man, that is really cool.
[10:12.260 --> 10:13.380]  I appreciate that.
[10:13.380 --> 10:18.020]  Not only am I delivering quality content, but this person feels that I am interesting.
[10:18.020 --> 10:20.420]  I didn't realize I was an interesting person.
[10:20.420 --> 10:22.180]  I do know that I've got some cannabis knowledge.
[10:22.180 --> 10:26.540]  I do know that I talk too much, but I did not realize that other people found me interesting
[10:26.540 --> 10:27.540]  outside of that.
[10:27.540 --> 10:30.820]  So that is really refreshing, reassuring or something like that.
[10:30.820 --> 10:33.500]  I don't know what it is, but it feels good and it gives me confidence.
[10:33.500 --> 10:37.140]  So I want to thank you for the great review and thanks again for saying that I am an interesting
[10:37.220 --> 10:38.220]  person.
[10:38.220 --> 10:40.300]  I don't think I realized that people find me interesting.
[10:40.300 --> 10:41.300]  So thank you.
[10:41.300 --> 10:42.300]  I appreciate that.
[10:42.300 --> 10:47.020]  Big shout out to our new friend, Dean 221, who of course left a five-star review.
[10:47.020 --> 10:49.460]  I've got a couple of more reviews left here on the screen.
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.940]  I know I'm talking really quickly.
[10:50.940 --> 10:55.820]  I'm going to blame that on a little bit of caffeine and a whole lot of dog fighter dabs
[10:55.820 --> 10:57.540]  from our friends at Green Dot.
[10:57.540 --> 10:58.540]  Let's keep going.
[10:58.540 --> 11:03.860]  This review was left on September 28th of 2019 by a person who calls themselves, I can't
[11:03.860 --> 11:06.180]  tell if that's Mevan or Melvin.
[11:06.220 --> 11:09.300]  It looks like it's Mevan818.
[11:09.300 --> 11:11.420]  The headline of the review says, give thanks.
[11:11.420 --> 11:13.900]  Of course, they gave us a five-star rating.
[11:13.900 --> 11:17.340]  The review goes just like this.
[11:17.340 --> 11:19.840]  This podcast has something for everyone.
[11:19.840 --> 11:20.840]  That is my goal.
[11:20.840 --> 11:21.840]  Thank you.
[11:21.840 --> 11:22.840]  I'm glad I'm hitting the goal.
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.340]  Like I've said before, I want to get the new growers.
[11:24.340 --> 11:25.860]  I want to get the professional growers.
[11:25.860 --> 11:27.180]  I want to get the breeders.
[11:27.180 --> 11:29.260]  I want to get the commercial cultivators.
[11:29.260 --> 11:30.660]  I want to get the cannabis activists.
[11:30.660 --> 11:32.780]  I want everybody involved in the podcast.
[11:32.780 --> 11:34.860]  So I'm glad that I'm hitting that goal.
[11:34.860 --> 11:40.980]  He says, or they say, I love the grow episodes and the push for activism to free the plant.
[11:40.980 --> 11:44.140]  I am a veteran who prefers organic medicine.
[11:44.140 --> 11:49.340]  Thank you so much for what you have done for my garden and especially for the community.
[11:49.340 --> 11:50.340]  I appreciate that.
[11:50.340 --> 11:54.100]  I hope you are growing quality medicine for yourself with my guidance.
[11:54.100 --> 11:57.540]  I know I don't talk a lot about organic growing.
[11:57.540 --> 11:59.700]  I'm more of a bottled nutrient.
[11:59.700 --> 12:03.460]  Of course, everybody knows I like Veg Bloom and New Millennium Nutrients are some of my
[12:03.460 --> 12:04.460]  favorites.
[12:05.060 --> 12:07.580]  But I will get more organic knowledge on the show for you.
[12:07.580 --> 12:11.260]  I hope my cultivation knowledge and my grow lessons are helping you out.
[12:11.260 --> 12:17.900]  I will work more on getting some organic based, organic focused info out on the show for you.
[12:17.900 --> 12:21.060]  So again, big thanks to our friend, Mevan818.
[12:21.060 --> 12:22.860]  I hope you are growing some great medicine.
[12:22.860 --> 12:25.280]  And he said you're a veteran, so I owe you a thank you.
[12:25.280 --> 12:28.740]  I am able to do what I do because you did what you did.
[12:28.740 --> 12:29.740]  So thank you.
[12:29.740 --> 12:30.900]  I do appreciate that.
[12:30.900 --> 12:35.620]  Unless it's cannabis related, I really avoid talking about politics on this show.
[12:35.620 --> 12:39.380]  I don't share my political views or ideals on this podcast because that is not what this
[12:39.380 --> 12:41.060]  show is all about.
[12:41.060 --> 12:42.700]  I do not like war.
[12:42.700 --> 12:44.620]  I don't like the idea of that stuff.
[12:44.620 --> 12:48.580]  However, I do appreciate and respect our soldiers.
[12:48.580 --> 12:53.740]  I appreciate, I respect, and I am grateful for anyone who puts their life on the line
[12:53.740 --> 12:57.660]  to protect people, freedoms, or anything that they believe in.
[12:57.660 --> 12:58.900]  So big respect for that.
[12:58.900 --> 13:00.580]  Now let's get off this little weird soapbox.
[13:01.260 --> 13:03.260]  I've just created and let's keep reading reviews.
[13:03.260 --> 13:04.900]  Again, thank you.
[13:04.900 --> 13:09.260]  I do appreciate your service and thank you again for the great review.
[13:09.260 --> 13:11.100]  I've got one more review on my screen.
[13:11.100 --> 13:15.520]  This one comes from a person who calls themselves Hobbit Feet DGC.
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.420]  Big shout out to anybody from the DGC.
[13:17.420 --> 13:19.600]  That is the Dude Grows crew.
[13:19.600 --> 13:25.020]  If you are not already checking out the Dude Grows podcast, I highly suggest you give them
[13:25.020 --> 13:26.020]  a listen.
[13:26.020 --> 13:27.540]  They are available on iTunes.
[13:27.540 --> 13:29.060]  They're available on Stitcher.
[13:29.060 --> 13:31.540]  And of course, they are available on YouTube.
[13:31.540 --> 13:35.060]  They are a great resource for cannabis growers.
[13:35.060 --> 13:38.500]  The Dude Grows show, of course, is hosted by a dude known as The Dude.
[13:38.500 --> 13:41.140]  He is backed up by a guy named Scotty Real.
[13:41.140 --> 13:45.380]  And they've got a partner in crime that they call Guru, who keeps all the audio equipment
[13:45.380 --> 13:51.060]  running, who keeps all of the video equipment running, and chimes in with very useful horticultural
[13:51.060 --> 13:52.060]  knowledge.
[13:52.060 --> 13:53.060]  He is very well educated.
[13:53.060 --> 13:54.500]  You can tell the man has been to school.
[13:54.500 --> 13:56.500]  You can tell he is passionate about cannabis.
[13:56.500 --> 13:59.300]  And you can tell he is passionate about our community.
[13:59.300 --> 14:02.220]  So big shout out to all of my boys from the Dude Grows crew.
[14:02.220 --> 14:05.000]  Make sure you guys check out the Dude Grows podcast.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.520]  Become part of the Dude Grows crew.
[14:07.520 --> 14:10.740]  And then join us at some of the Dude Grows events that we throw, they throw.
[14:10.740 --> 14:12.140]  I just put myself right in the mix.
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.140]  What's up, guys?
[14:13.140 --> 14:14.140]  I'm part of that now.
[14:14.140 --> 14:18.260]  Join us at some of the events which we throw throughout the year in Colorado.
[14:18.260 --> 14:19.580]  So big shout out to the DGC.
[14:19.580 --> 14:22.540]  Let's get my high, rambly ass back on track.
[14:22.540 --> 14:24.740]  Big shout out to Hobbit Feet DGC.
[14:24.740 --> 14:26.820]  They gave us a five-star review.
[14:26.820 --> 14:29.060]  The headline says, wonderful podcast.
[14:29.060 --> 14:30.200]  So we got to give thanks.
[14:30.200 --> 14:31.800]  We got a awesome podcast.
[14:31.800 --> 14:32.800]  We got a great show.
[14:32.800 --> 14:34.980]  Got a bunch of great headlines.
[14:34.980 --> 14:38.860]  Now let's focus in and read the rest of this review from our friend Hobbit Feet.
[14:38.860 --> 14:40.800]  Of course, the review just disappeared off the screen.
[14:40.800 --> 14:41.800]  Here we go.
[14:41.800 --> 14:42.800]  It goes like this.
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.940]  This is one of the best growing podcasts for beginners and experts.
[14:46.940 --> 14:49.820]  I love that that is the theme of the reviews.
[14:49.820 --> 14:52.200]  It is a great show for beginners and experts.
[14:52.200 --> 14:54.460]  That means a lot to me that I'm hitting my goal.
[14:54.460 --> 14:57.160]  You guys, when you set out to do something and you're not sure if you're getting it right
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.980]  or not, and a bunch of people say best for beginners and experts, and your whole goal
[15:01.980 --> 15:05.380]  was to get for beginners and experts, that just makes you fucking dance in your chair.
[15:05.380 --> 15:07.580]  Yes, I am dancing in my chair right now.
[15:07.580 --> 15:09.020]  I'm just doing a little boogie.
[15:09.020 --> 15:10.180]  Don't even try to visualize it.
[15:10.180 --> 15:11.620]  It's fucking goofy.
[15:11.620 --> 15:15.300]  The review goes, I've learned so much and laughed along the way.
[15:15.300 --> 15:17.020]  Again, that is my goal.
[15:17.020 --> 15:20.140]  I was a bad student in school.
[15:20.140 --> 15:22.200]  I've got ADD like you would not believe.
[15:22.200 --> 15:26.920]  I'm sure you can tell just by listening to me speak that my attention goes crazy, but
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.920]  I love to learn.
[15:27.920 --> 15:30.920]  I love filling my brain with knowledge and useful facts.
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.680]  I just don't want to learn the dumb, useless crap that we keep repeating in school.
[15:34.680 --> 15:35.920]  I had to learn over and over.
[15:35.920 --> 15:36.920]  I already know that.
[15:36.920 --> 15:37.920]  Teach me something new.
[15:37.920 --> 15:38.920]  Let me learn.
[15:38.920 --> 15:39.920]  Expand my mind.
[15:39.920 --> 15:41.520]  I hated school.
[15:41.520 --> 15:45.360]  I had a few teachers that made an effort to actually teach us.
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.600]  They weren't just reciting shit out of a workbook and making us fucking do assignments.
[15:49.600 --> 15:54.840]  They were making an effort to be teachers, to shape us as people for the future.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.720]  Those teachers, I remember them.
[15:56.720 --> 15:58.440]  A lot of them were funny.
[15:58.440 --> 16:02.120]  A lot of them had a personality with which I could connect.
[16:02.120 --> 16:05.420]  That was harder to say than it should have been, but those teachers are the teachers
[16:05.420 --> 16:09.400]  that made an impact on me, not the teachers that stood in front of the class and droned
[16:09.400 --> 16:11.080]  on and bored the shit out of me.
[16:11.080 --> 16:13.960]  I don't remember any of those teachers or their classes.
[16:13.960 --> 16:17.400]  There are a few teachers I remember vividly because we connected.
[16:17.400 --> 16:21.280]  I feel like if you connect with me a little bit, if I connect with you a little bit, I
[16:21.280 --> 16:22.440]  can teach you a lot.
[16:22.440 --> 16:25.180]  A little bit of laughter makes you put your guard down.
[16:25.180 --> 16:27.400]  You get comfortable with me, and then you want to learn.
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.260]  You put down that, uh, school.
[16:29.260 --> 16:30.560]  You forget that you're learning.
[16:30.560 --> 16:32.600]  You're laughing, and you're absorbing information.
[16:32.600 --> 16:37.000]  I think that a little bit of laughter and a lot of education is a perfect mix.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.800]  I am really hitting my goal with that, and this review makes me feel really good.
[16:40.800 --> 16:42.160]  I'm sorry I got so rambly about it.
[16:42.160 --> 16:43.200]  We're going to keep going.
[16:43.200 --> 16:48.160]  It says, Jeff is an awesome human being, and White Mike is the best.
[16:48.160 --> 16:49.400]  You hear that, White Mike?
[16:49.400 --> 16:51.280]  Somebody thinks that you are the best.
[16:51.280 --> 16:55.000]  We got to get you back over here, get you on the podcast, bro, because people obviously
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.960]  enjoy your presence.
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.960]  The review just disappeared off of the screen.
[16:58.960 --> 17:00.720]  I've got to refresh, so we'll get it going again.
[17:00.720 --> 17:01.720]  Here we go.
[17:01.720 --> 17:02.720]  White Mike is the best.
[17:02.720 --> 17:06.480]  It goes on to say, this podcast has it all.
[17:06.480 --> 17:07.480]  Stay irie.
[17:07.480 --> 17:09.760]  Hey, Hobbit Feet, thank you for the great review.
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.960]  Thank you for the five stars.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.440]  I really appreciate that.
[17:12.680 --> 17:17.640]  You guys, these were great iTunes podcast customer reviews.
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.600]  I know I keep saying it, but it means a lot to me to know that I am perfectly hitting
[17:22.600 --> 17:23.600]  my goal.
[17:23.600 --> 17:25.200]  I wanted to teach everybody to grow.
[17:25.200 --> 17:27.040]  I want to put a little bit of laughter into it.
[17:27.040 --> 17:28.320]  I want to get the new growers.
[17:28.320 --> 17:29.720]  I want to get the pro growers.
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.680]  I want to get the activists and the advocates involved, and it really feels like that White
[17:33.680 --> 17:37.040]  Mike and myself have really hit my goal.
[17:37.040 --> 17:39.460]  Thank you to everybody who is listening.
[17:39.460 --> 17:43.340]  Thank you to everybody who has sent a review, not just on this episode, but all of the reviews
[17:43.340 --> 17:45.820]  that I've read in the past and any other service.
[17:45.820 --> 17:50.340]  If you're leaving reviews on YouTube or Stitcher and I'm not reading them, still, thank you
[17:50.340 --> 17:51.340]  for those reviews.
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.420]  I do appreciate it.
[17:52.420 --> 17:57.180]  I will read some comments and reviews from YouTube in a future episode, but I've gotten
[17:57.180 --> 18:00.780]  a couple of emails that these episodes are not people's favorites.
[18:00.780 --> 18:03.820]  They would rather me focus in on grow stuff, which does make sense.
[18:03.820 --> 18:08.100]  This is the Grow From Your Heart podcast, not the Review From Your Heart podcast.
[18:08.140 --> 18:11.980]  This is a Thursday episode, and once again, this was a little beta test to make sure that
[18:11.980 --> 18:15.140]  my recording gear is working after a couple of updates.
[18:15.140 --> 18:19.100]  Once again, big thank you to everybody who has sent an iTunes review on this episode
[18:19.100 --> 18:21.120]  or in a previous episode.
[18:21.120 --> 18:24.820]  Big thanks for all of these Stitcher comments, and a huge thank you to everybody who has
[18:24.820 --> 18:27.260]  been leaving comments on my YouTube channel.
[18:27.260 --> 18:31.460]  If you're not already subscribed to YouTube, I would appreciate it if you go to YouTube,

[18:39.700 --> 18:40.700]  episode.
[18:40.700 --> 18:44.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, chicks and bros, smokers
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.900]  and growers, friends and foes, flunkies and bunkies, I ain't got shit else I ran out of.
[18:48.900 --> 18:50.780]  I was on a roll there for a minute.
[18:50.780 --> 18:52.380]  Big thanks to everybody for listening to the show.
[18:52.380 --> 18:53.780]  I'm going to wrap up this episode.
[18:53.780 --> 18:57.620]  I'm going to go edit and make sure that all of the software works properly.
[18:57.620 --> 19:01.760]  That way I can be confident and record a solid Monday episode for you.

[19:37.160 --> 19:39.920]  and cannabis videos on Cannabuzz.
[19:39.920 --> 19:44.000]  If you're growing some plants and you've got questions, post a picture of them, tag me,
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  I'll go take a look.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.280]  We can figure out what's wrong with your plants and the entire Cannabuzz community will chime
[19:49.280 --> 19:51.320]  in with useful advice.
[19:51.320 --> 19:52.600]  Join us on Cannabuzz.

[19:57.680 --> 20:00.280]  any Irie Genetics crosses.
[20:00.280 --> 20:03.000]  If you've got something you'd like to say and you're not into all that social media
[20:03.000 --> 20:04.920]  nonsense, you can send me an email.
[20:04.920 --> 20:08.320]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[20:08.320 --> 20:11.360]  Again, you know that I would love to hear from you.
[20:11.360 --> 20:15.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for listening to episode 472 of the Grow From
[20:15.400 --> 20:16.760]  Your Heart podcast.
[20:16.760 --> 20:19.680]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[20:19.680 --> 20:22.840]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend, Jesse James.
[20:22.840 --> 20:26.400]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
