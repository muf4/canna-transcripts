[00:00.000 --> 00:11.530]  All right, here we go.
[00:11.530 --> 00:12.530]  Take three.
[00:12.530 --> 00:13.530]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:13.530 --> 00:14.530]  I'm your host.

[00:20.810 --> 00:25.210]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow emails and questions.
[00:25.210 --> 00:29.010]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those kind
[00:29.010 --> 00:31.930]  of folks who support the show on Patreon.

[01:45.210 --> 01:48.530]  While we're doing shout outs and saying thanks to people, I want to send a big thank you.
[01:48.530 --> 01:49.530]  Shout out today.
[01:49.530 --> 01:50.930]  Today, I went to the P.O.
[01:50.930 --> 01:52.970]  Box and I got a great gift in there.
[01:52.970 --> 01:53.970]  The P.O.
[01:53.970 --> 01:56.330]  Box is often stuffed with great gifts, but this one was pretty cool.
[01:56.330 --> 02:00.370]  Something useful, something that will get to put get put to use on a daily basis.
[02:00.370 --> 02:03.970]  I have not had the opportunity to use it yet, but I promise you I will.
[02:03.970 --> 02:04.970]  It came with a letter.
[02:04.970 --> 02:07.470]  It says, Hey Jeff, big fan of the pod.
[02:07.470 --> 02:10.570]  The grow has benefited a lot since starting to listen.
[02:10.570 --> 02:11.570]  That's what it's all about.
[02:11.570 --> 02:12.570]  Making the grow look better.
[02:12.570 --> 02:16.690]  It says, I thought I would send you a GFYH grinder as a thank you.
[02:16.690 --> 02:19.330]  Feel free to check out the company on the Instagram.
[02:19.330 --> 02:22.250]  Have a great day from Mike at custom dank.
[02:22.250 --> 02:26.470]  I want to show you this label before I show you the grinder they sent me, but big shout
[02:26.470 --> 02:27.730]  out to our friends custom dank.
[02:27.730 --> 02:30.010]  I want to make sure to get that on one of the cameras.
[02:30.650 --> 02:34.890]  I may just have to pop in a logo later, but make sure you follow our friends custom dank
[02:34.890 --> 02:35.890]  on Instagram.
[02:35.890 --> 02:37.170]  They did send me a beautiful gift.
[02:37.170 --> 02:38.170]  They are great people.
[02:38.170 --> 02:43.970]  Uh, it is spelled just like you think it would be custom dank or if you're dyslexic, dank
[02:43.970 --> 02:45.490]  custom will work as well.
[02:45.490 --> 02:47.530]  Not making fun of the dyslexic folks.
[02:47.530 --> 02:50.890]  I may have a touch of this dyslexia myself if you've never noticed.
[02:50.890 --> 02:54.010]  All right, this is the gift that my friends did send me here.
[02:54.010 --> 02:57.690]  That is an awesome grow from your heart podcast logo grinder.
[02:57.690 --> 02:58.690]  It's got the GF.
[02:58.690 --> 03:01.010]  I'm going to take this part off just so I don't dump it on my computer.
[03:01.010 --> 03:03.170]  It does have the GFYH logo.
[03:03.170 --> 03:07.650]  I may have to take another photo of that and insert it in later, but there is the GFYH
[03:07.650 --> 03:11.770]  podcast logo beautifully engraved, embossed, laser etched.
[03:11.770 --> 03:15.130]  I don't know exactly how, but it is beautifully done on the top of this grinder.
[03:15.130 --> 03:18.130]  They even got the little gradient part in the middle of the logo.
[03:18.130 --> 03:19.130]  It's perfect.
[03:19.130 --> 03:20.130]  It's beautiful.
[03:20.130 --> 03:21.130]  Thank you.
[03:21.130 --> 03:22.130]  You did a hell of a good job on the artwork.
[03:22.130 --> 03:23.410]  Then let's talk about the grinder.
[03:23.410 --> 03:27.130]  The grinder itself is very well made, very well constructed.
[03:27.130 --> 03:29.530]  I'm going to say this is probably aluminum.
[03:29.530 --> 03:33.330]  I said that word very oddly, but who doesn't say aluminum oddly?
[03:33.330 --> 03:35.850]  It's got a nice grinding wheel on the inside, nice teeth in there.
[03:35.850 --> 03:36.850]  They look sharp.
[03:36.850 --> 03:37.850]  They look strong.
[03:37.850 --> 03:38.850]  Then you unscrew it.
[03:38.850 --> 03:42.010]  You put your product in here, give it a good twist, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[03:42.010 --> 03:43.410]  Then you'd unscrew here.
[03:43.410 --> 03:44.650]  Then I kind of liked this part.
[03:44.650 --> 03:47.690]  Once you unscrew it, you'd kind of set that part to the side.
[03:47.690 --> 03:50.090]  There's a little dish in here that is removable.
[03:50.090 --> 03:52.370]  I like that this little dish comes out.
[03:52.370 --> 03:53.810]  It's got a little screen on the bottom of there.
[03:53.810 --> 03:56.490]  Of course, you'd catch your key catch down here in the bottom.
[03:56.850 --> 03:58.850]  It's got a little scraper for your key catch.
[03:58.850 --> 04:00.410]  I really enjoy that.
[04:00.410 --> 04:02.730]  Beautiful basic grinder, but it's got the logo on it.
[04:02.730 --> 04:03.730]  It's well made.
[04:03.730 --> 04:05.050]  I like that little cup in the middle.
[04:05.050 --> 04:06.050]  Beautiful.
[04:06.050 --> 04:08.090]  Great gift for a cannabis consumer.
[04:08.090 --> 04:09.090]  Thank you.
[04:09.090 --> 04:10.090]  Please do follow my friends.
[04:10.090 --> 04:15.090]  I appreciate good gifts, especially stuff with the GFYH podcast logo.
[04:15.090 --> 04:16.090]  All right.
[04:16.090 --> 04:17.090]  Big shout out to our friends.
[04:17.090 --> 04:18.810]  Make sure you give them a follow, please.
[04:18.810 --> 04:20.770]  If you want to send more gifts, send me an email.
[04:20.770 --> 04:21.770]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:21.770 --> 04:24.330]  We'll get you set up with the PO box.
[04:24.330 --> 04:27.690]  We'll do one of those episodes where we just open up a bunch of cool shit for the whole
[04:27.690 --> 04:28.690]  show.
[04:28.690 --> 04:29.690]  All right.
[04:29.690 --> 04:32.410]  The music ended and it got quiet, so let's focus on a podcast.
[04:32.410 --> 04:37.010]  In a previous episode, I did a lesson on phenotypes.
[04:37.010 --> 04:39.090]  I defined the word phenotype.
[04:39.090 --> 04:41.890]  Definition was the word I was looking for that would not come to my brain.
[04:41.890 --> 04:43.330]  We talked a lot about phenotypes.
[04:43.330 --> 04:46.290]  I told you what phenotypes were, how to find phenotypes.
[04:46.290 --> 04:48.530]  We talked a lot about the word phenotypes.
[04:48.530 --> 04:53.290]  I got a great follow-up question from a podcast listener or viewer.
[04:53.290 --> 04:54.770]  I'm not sure if you're watching or viewing.
[04:54.770 --> 04:59.690]  Either way, thank you for the interaction and thank you for the great feedback and update.
[04:59.690 --> 05:02.250]  This is a very respectable and respectful letter.
[05:02.250 --> 05:04.650]  Let's not run around in too many circles.
[05:04.650 --> 05:06.730]  Let's get right to it.
[05:06.730 --> 05:10.130]  It says, you are the best and you give back in so many ways.
[05:10.130 --> 05:11.250]  Thanks and respect.
[05:11.250 --> 05:12.250]  Big respect.
[05:12.250 --> 05:13.250]  The respect is mutual here.
[05:13.250 --> 05:17.330]  I can tell by the way this is written that you do disagree with me very respectfully.
[05:17.330 --> 05:19.210]  That's a great way to have a conversation.
[05:19.210 --> 05:25.770]  It goes on to say, I do disagree with you on one topic in episode 655 about phenotypes
[05:25.770 --> 05:29.530]  where you said that you're backing off on your phenotype discussions in your strain
[05:29.530 --> 05:30.690]  descriptions.
[05:30.690 --> 05:33.730]  I disagree that you should do that and here is why.
[05:33.730 --> 05:39.770]  Yes, I did say that I feel like I'm messing up by giving you too much guidance and too
[05:39.770 --> 05:42.050]  much help on selecting phenotypes.
[05:42.050 --> 05:43.950]  I feel like that is some work that you should do.
[05:43.950 --> 05:46.010]  That is custom work that should be tailored for you.
[05:46.010 --> 05:47.290]  That's why there are phenotypes.
[05:47.410 --> 05:49.490]  Why there is selection to be done.
[05:49.490 --> 05:51.410]  That's part of the beauty of growing.
[05:51.410 --> 05:53.530]  I was going to leave that up to you a little bit.
[05:53.530 --> 05:55.450]  I feel like I've offered a quality product.
[05:55.450 --> 05:58.050]  Why not give you some variation to choose from?
[05:58.050 --> 05:59.050]  Find what you want.
[05:59.050 --> 06:01.090]  I've said all of this on the previous episode.
[06:01.090 --> 06:03.250]  Let me keep going with this message.
[06:03.250 --> 06:08.450]  It says, I had a skunk number one, sweet skunk plant that I wanted to improve upon, which
[06:08.450 --> 06:11.370]  is a great use for some of my genetics if you want to breed something and make it a
[06:11.370 --> 06:12.370]  little better.
[06:12.370 --> 06:15.610]  Some of my stuff is definitely a good way to do that.
[06:15.610 --> 06:20.570]  It says, I researched regular male seeds and I decided on a rise.
[06:20.570 --> 06:21.970]  That is a very good breeding plant.
[06:21.970 --> 06:27.450]  It says my goals were to bring up my THC and increase bud density while retaining my skunk's
[06:27.450 --> 06:28.450]  bud formation.
[06:28.450 --> 06:30.010]  Excuse me.
[06:30.010 --> 06:35.330]  The skunk's bud formation, classic red, orange, light green, and so many swelled bracts, and
[06:35.330 --> 06:38.050]  she looks over seeded traits.
[06:38.050 --> 06:43.530]  So a trait of this plant is red, orange, and light green with swelled bracts that look
[06:43.530 --> 06:45.130]  like they are over seeded.
[06:45.650 --> 06:47.250]  It looks like it's got some swollen bracts on there.
[06:47.250 --> 06:48.810]  It's just a trait of the plant.
[06:48.810 --> 06:51.010]  It's not seeded, but it looks like it.
[06:51.010 --> 06:55.850]  That is a trait that is an observable characteristic of this plant.
[06:55.850 --> 06:58.970]  So he wanted to keep that trait along with the bud formation.
[06:58.970 --> 07:01.850]  Then they wanted to add some density and a little bit of potency.
[07:01.850 --> 07:06.650]  So they selected, chose a rise as the breeding male, which is a very good choice.
[07:06.650 --> 07:09.730]  They knew that because of the things that I typed on my website.
[07:09.730 --> 07:11.650]  We'll talk about that.
[07:11.650 --> 07:16.250]  It goes on to say, I got 10 Arise seeds from seedsherenow.com.
[07:16.250 --> 07:18.050]  I acquired four males.
[07:18.050 --> 07:21.130]  I was hoping for a 50-50 Pheno, but no.
[07:21.130 --> 07:27.850]  What I had to choose from was one Golden Goat, one Stretcher, one Daybreaker, and one question
[07:27.850 --> 07:28.850]  mark.
[07:28.850 --> 07:31.050]  I know this how, you ask?
[07:31.050 --> 07:34.730]  Because of your great Arise Pheno descriptions.
[07:34.730 --> 07:40.350]  So if I hadn't described that Arise plant and those Phenos to expect very well, so well,
[07:40.350 --> 07:43.930]  this listener, this breeder, this grower would not have known that Arise would be the
[07:43.930 --> 07:48.410]  perfect candidate for breeding to make his project what he wanted it to be.
[07:48.410 --> 07:52.750]  So the reliable description that I gave, the in-depth, the detailed description that I
[07:52.750 --> 07:56.710]  gave about phenotypes, that really helped our grower friend, our breeder friend, our
[07:56.710 --> 08:00.590]  listener, maybe a viewer friend to make the proper selections.
[08:00.590 --> 08:04.950]  So maybe, just maybe, I do need to keep giving those detailed descriptions.
[08:04.950 --> 08:05.950]  There's more to this.
[08:05.950 --> 08:06.950]  It goes on.
[08:06.950 --> 08:08.690]  It says, Monkey Puke.
[08:08.690 --> 08:09.710]  That's a really great name.
[08:09.710 --> 08:12.230]  Not something I would have used, something I do love.
[08:12.230 --> 08:13.230]  So that's beautiful.
[08:13.230 --> 08:16.510]  I love it when you nail it and get the name right and you didn't take something I would
[08:16.510 --> 08:17.510]  have used.
[08:17.510 --> 08:18.510]  Nothing wrong with it.
[08:18.510 --> 08:19.510]  I love the name.
[08:19.510 --> 08:21.190]  It's just not on my brand.
[08:21.190 --> 08:22.230]  I got to stay on brand.
[08:22.230 --> 08:23.230]  It's off brand for me.
[08:23.230 --> 08:24.910]  It's very on brand for you probably.
[08:24.910 --> 08:25.910]  So that's beautiful.
[08:25.910 --> 08:28.290]  Monkey Puke.
[08:28.290 --> 08:31.810]  If I saw a jar of Monkey Puke on the shelf, I would want to smell that.
[08:31.810 --> 08:33.350]  What does Monkey Puke smell like?
[08:33.350 --> 08:36.430]  That's what my brain, I would just go, what does, and I would know it's not real Monkey
[08:36.430 --> 08:37.430]  Puke.
[08:37.430 --> 08:38.430]  There was not a primate involved.
[08:38.430 --> 08:39.910]  There was no vomiting to be done.
[08:39.910 --> 08:43.570]  But I think that's what Monkey Puke is going to smell like once I smell the jar.
[08:43.570 --> 08:44.710]  That's what you've done to my brain.
[08:44.710 --> 08:47.870]  I really think I'm smelling Monkey Puke.
[08:47.870 --> 08:50.710]  Weird psychological tricks we play on people with strange names here.
[08:50.710 --> 08:51.750]  Let me continue here.
[08:51.750 --> 08:56.550]  Monkey Puke, F1, which is skunk one to arise, is in day 45.
[08:56.550 --> 08:59.630]  And I think I got exactly what I wanted.
[08:59.630 --> 09:02.190]  I love so many things about this message.
[09:02.190 --> 09:06.270]  The respectful argument, the respectful disagreement may be my favorite part.
[09:07.270 --> 09:11.270]  You've mentioned so many details about your breeding, your goal, your idea, the reason
[09:11.270 --> 09:12.990]  you were doing this.
[09:12.990 --> 09:14.190]  That is so awesome.
[09:14.190 --> 09:15.990]  And it looks like you are hitting your goal.
[09:15.990 --> 09:19.990]  You're 45 days in and it appears like you are getting what you wanted and expected out
[09:19.990 --> 09:20.990]  of that.
[09:20.990 --> 09:21.990]  That's exciting.
[09:21.990 --> 09:24.430]  From one breeder to another, that is really exciting.
[09:24.430 --> 09:25.430]  Good job.
[09:25.430 --> 09:26.430]  Big up.
[09:26.430 --> 09:27.430]  Much respect.
[09:27.430 --> 09:28.430]  That is super cool.
[09:28.430 --> 09:29.430]  I'm excited for you, brother.
[09:29.430 --> 09:30.430]  Really.
[09:30.430 --> 09:31.430]  Just from one bro, one breeder to another.
[09:31.430 --> 09:34.670]  I know what it's like when it's like 45 days in and you're going, oh, I think I've done
[09:34.670 --> 09:35.670]  it.
[09:36.070 --> 09:37.070]  I think I got exactly what I wanted.
[09:37.070 --> 09:40.630]  It's like when the chef starts smelling the ingredients and everybody in the kitchen,
[09:40.630 --> 09:41.630]  it smells good, right?
[09:41.630 --> 09:44.390]  But people in the living room start peeking their head and going, bro, what are you doing
[09:44.390 --> 09:45.390]  in here?
[09:45.390 --> 09:46.630]  It smells fucking good.
[09:46.630 --> 09:47.670]  That's where we are.
[09:47.670 --> 09:50.910]  If you're not a grower, if you're not a breeder, you don't understand the feeling.
[09:50.910 --> 09:51.910]  That is the feeling.
[09:51.910 --> 09:55.550]  When somebody peeps their head in the kitchen and goes, dude, whatever you're cooking, I
[09:55.550 --> 09:57.350]  can't wait for it to be done.
[09:57.350 --> 09:58.670]  That's where we are with this project.
[09:58.670 --> 09:59.670]  And it's exciting.
[09:59.670 --> 10:01.430]  I'm excited for you, bro, if you can't tell.
[10:01.430 --> 10:05.950]  It says, only time and possibly an F2 generation will tell.
[10:05.950 --> 10:09.470]  I love that you're even ready, already, already ready to take it to F2.
[10:09.470 --> 10:11.110]  We haven't even finished the F1 batch.
[10:11.110 --> 10:13.030]  This guy's excited and eager.
[10:13.030 --> 10:16.510]  These are the types of breeders we need in this industry.
[10:16.510 --> 10:20.350]  The point remains that I would have no idea what I was looking for in a male without your
[10:20.350 --> 10:25.310]  arise, strain description, and your selecting a male podcast.
[10:25.310 --> 10:31.350]  With 99% of the other breeders' work, you have zero, zip, nothing to go by.
[10:31.350 --> 10:34.550]  Remember a 1% or my friend, don't change what you're doing.
[10:34.550 --> 10:36.510]  Add more strain descriptions.
[10:36.510 --> 10:40.630]  I'm going to interrupt myself here and I'm going to say my website needs some attention.
[10:40.630 --> 10:44.930]  You guys, I've got strain descriptions and photos for most of my stuff up there.
[10:44.930 --> 10:48.330]  If you look at the website, you notice there's not a photo, there's not a strain description
[10:48.330 --> 10:50.710]  for something that you've got experience with.
[10:50.710 --> 10:53.910]  Send me a message, include that photo, include that strain description.
[10:53.910 --> 10:57.910]  If you've just got some details about a strain that you think should be on the website, this
[10:57.910 --> 11:00.110]  one gets super fat at the end of week nine.
[11:00.110 --> 11:02.990]  If you let this one go to week 10, it gets super stinky.
[11:02.990 --> 11:05.230]  Whatever you notice, send me some details like that.
[11:05.230 --> 11:06.390]  I will send you a thanks.
[11:06.390 --> 11:07.590]  I will give you a shout out.
[11:07.590 --> 11:08.830]  I will make it worth it to you.
[11:08.830 --> 11:11.890]  If you've got some great photos, please send me those photos.
[11:11.890 --> 11:14.130]  Maybe I just need to update the website with your photos.
[11:14.130 --> 11:16.090]  Maybe your photos are better than what's there.
[11:16.090 --> 11:17.090]  Don't be shy.
[11:17.090 --> 11:20.630]  I would like to get the website updated for the start of the year.
[11:20.630 --> 11:21.630]  Thank you.
[11:21.630 --> 11:23.630]  All right, let's get right back into this.
[11:23.630 --> 11:25.230]  Keep adding the strain descriptions.
[11:25.230 --> 11:26.230]  Don't change.
[11:26.230 --> 11:27.230]  Keep what you're doing.
[11:27.230 --> 11:28.230]  Add more descriptions.
[11:28.230 --> 11:29.230]  That's where we were in this.
[11:29.350 --> 11:30.710]  I want to add more descriptions.
[11:30.710 --> 11:32.230]  I want to add more pictures.
[11:32.230 --> 11:34.430]  I want to talk more about phenotypes.
[11:34.430 --> 11:35.430]  It is summertime.
[11:35.430 --> 11:39.550]  I just realized I've got an awesome summer project I wasn't prepared for.
[11:39.550 --> 11:41.070]  I will do more stuff on the website.
[11:41.070 --> 11:42.470]  I just asked for help for that.
[11:42.470 --> 11:44.870]  As I grow these strains, I do learn more things about them.
[11:44.870 --> 11:45.870]  I have to grow them.
[11:45.870 --> 11:47.550]  I have to develop the relationship.
[11:47.550 --> 11:51.110]  If I don't see that something is factual, I don't put it on the website.
[11:51.110 --> 11:55.990]  I don't just ramble off some shit like, say that it's bright green and smells like a skunk's
[11:55.990 --> 11:58.990]  ass and it makes you feel like you just came when you smoke it.
[11:59.030 --> 12:02.110]  I could put that on the website about everything, but there's no need to do that.
[12:02.110 --> 12:03.110]  You're going to buy it.
[12:03.110 --> 12:04.110]  You're going to grow it.
[12:04.110 --> 12:05.110]  You're going to smoke it.
[12:05.110 --> 12:06.590]  Then you're going to call me back and say, I still don't feel like I came after you smoke
[12:06.590 --> 12:09.670]  it and no one's going to want to buy that again.
[12:09.670 --> 12:10.670]  I have to grow them.
[12:10.670 --> 12:11.670]  I have to get the experience.
[12:11.670 --> 12:16.510]  I have to develop the relationship to be able to talk about it in that sort of a deep detail.
[12:16.510 --> 12:17.510]  Be patient with me.
[12:17.510 --> 12:19.270]  There are so many limitations.
[12:19.270 --> 12:23.170]  I was running a lot of, not running, working with and operating in a lot of commercial
[12:23.170 --> 12:25.150]  facilities since COVID.
[12:25.150 --> 12:27.230]  I've really dialed that back.
[12:27.230 --> 12:32.110]  I'm on my own personal space and numbers, which really, really limits a breeder.
[12:32.110 --> 12:35.430]  I've got a lot of test growers out there helping me out and stuff.
[12:35.430 --> 12:38.950]  We're learning a lot, but not as rapidly as we could when we had the commercial environments
[12:38.950 --> 12:39.950]  at our fingertips.
[12:39.950 --> 12:40.950]  All right.
[12:40.950 --> 12:41.950]  Where was I?
[12:41.950 --> 12:47.550]  By the way, I got the most beautiful and lemony plant ever in the tent with Monkey Puke.
[12:47.550 --> 12:49.790]  She's an awesome lemon sunrise.
[12:49.790 --> 12:50.790]  What?
[12:50.790 --> 12:51.790]  What?
[12:51.790 --> 12:55.050]  There's a beautiful and lemony plant ever in the tent.
[12:55.050 --> 12:57.110]  She's an awesome lemon sunrise.
[12:57.110 --> 12:58.750]  That's a huge compliment, my friend.
[12:58.750 --> 13:00.270]  You are breeding with my genetics.
[13:00.270 --> 13:01.830]  You are growing my genetics.
[13:01.830 --> 13:03.830]  I'm honored that you trust me.
[13:03.830 --> 13:04.830]  You trust my breeding.
[13:04.830 --> 13:06.350]  You trust my selections.
[13:06.350 --> 13:09.430]  And then, thank you for the respectful argument.
[13:09.430 --> 13:10.430]  You have convinced me.
[13:10.430 --> 13:14.150]  I will continue to do in-depth phenotype explanations.
[13:14.150 --> 13:19.710]  What I want to do is help you guys identify the phenos and know what to expect.
[13:19.710 --> 13:27.030]  What I don't want you to do is make you search too hard for the phenotypes that I have talked
[13:27.070 --> 13:28.070]  about.
[13:28.070 --> 13:32.510]  I don't want you passing up awesome phenotypes that would work very well for you because
[13:32.510 --> 13:35.230]  you heard me talk about a different phenotype.
[13:35.230 --> 13:38.430]  Find the one that is going to work beautifully for you and work with that one.
[13:38.430 --> 13:41.870]  I don't want to mess you up is really what I'm trying to avoid.
[13:41.870 --> 13:43.710]  I will help you identify phenos.
[13:43.710 --> 13:45.870]  If you're like, hey, does this look more like the mean girl?
[13:45.870 --> 13:47.670]  Does this look more like the stretchy girl?
[13:47.670 --> 13:49.310]  I will tell you that stuff.
[13:49.310 --> 13:54.910]  Also, keep in mind, these phenotypes, I'm giving you ideas and suggestions of kind of
[13:54.910 --> 13:57.670]  guidelines of what box it may fall into.
[13:57.670 --> 14:02.990]  It could be more of the mean girl phenotype and the nice girl and the chunky girl phenotype.
[14:02.990 --> 14:07.030]  It could have, I could see all of that in there and it just doesn't have to be labeled
[14:07.030 --> 14:08.030]  one of those phenos.
[14:08.030 --> 14:12.070]  I'm just saying those are the common phenotypes that I have identified and traits that I have
[14:12.070 --> 14:17.750]  observed over time from working with these plants so many times.
[14:17.750 --> 14:20.950]  So I will continue to give in-depth descriptions of new stuff.
[14:20.950 --> 14:22.910]  I will update the old stuff.
[14:22.910 --> 14:28.190]  I will continue to give you phenotype ideas of what to expect out of the phenotypes.
[14:28.190 --> 14:30.750]  I will continue to help you identify phenotypes.
[14:30.750 --> 14:34.870]  If you send me a picture and you say, does this look more goat leaning or more arise
[14:34.870 --> 14:35.870]  leaning?
[14:35.870 --> 14:37.070]  I will try to help you with that.
[14:37.070 --> 14:38.830]  Don't get offended if I don't respond right away.
[14:38.830 --> 14:44.150]  I've got, I'm going to say about 18,000 unread emails right now and it's nothing personal.
[14:44.150 --> 14:48.870]  There's just one of me and there must be at least 18,000 of you with the question and
[14:48.870 --> 14:49.870]  I cannot keep up.
[14:49.870 --> 14:50.870]  I don't have an intern.
[14:50.870 --> 14:51.870]  I don't have a secretary.
[14:51.870 --> 14:52.870]  It is all me.
[14:52.870 --> 14:54.950]  I do the grow for the first half of the day.
[14:54.950 --> 14:58.670]  I do the podcast or internet work for the second half of the day.
[14:58.670 --> 15:02.350]  Then the third half of the day is when I do all the normal life stuff that most people
[15:02.350 --> 15:03.350]  do.
[15:03.350 --> 15:06.070]  And yeah, there are three halves to my day.
[15:06.070 --> 15:07.710]  So my days are different than yours.
[15:07.710 --> 15:09.830]  I'm trying to catch up.
[15:09.830 --> 15:15.510]  I guess being a small business owner or a business owner, a proprietor, an entrepreneur,
[15:15.510 --> 15:17.790]  I guess being overloaded is a good thing.
[15:17.790 --> 15:20.070]  If I catch up, that means I fucked up to tell you the truth.
[15:20.070 --> 15:22.830]  So I apologize that I'm behind.
[15:22.830 --> 15:24.630]  Also I'm very grateful that I'm behind.
[15:24.630 --> 15:26.590]  It's kind of a double edged sword.
[15:26.590 --> 15:30.710]  Also I used to let it super stress me that my social media inboxes were overflowed.
[15:30.710 --> 15:32.750]  My email inboxes were overflowed.
[15:32.750 --> 15:34.310]  At this point I have accepted it.
[15:34.310 --> 15:38.150]  It is just something that is going to be, I want to reply to you.
[15:38.150 --> 15:42.430]  I want to answer your messages, but I want to do a lot of shit also.
[15:42.430 --> 15:43.750]  I also want to take a nap.
[15:43.750 --> 15:47.670]  So don't take it personally if I'm not answering your message.
[15:47.670 --> 15:49.510]  Send me, send me your questions.
[15:49.510 --> 15:52.030]  Send me the phenotype questions is what I'm getting at.
[15:52.030 --> 15:54.510]  Let me know which phenotype you need me to identify.
[15:54.510 --> 15:58.710]  I'll do my best, but don't expect it to fall exactly in one of the boxes.
[15:58.710 --> 16:00.030]  It doesn't have to be golden goat.
[16:00.030 --> 16:01.150]  It doesn't have to be a rise.
[16:01.150 --> 16:02.790]  It doesn't have to be the 50 50.
[16:02.790 --> 16:04.630]  Maybe it's the 30 70.
[16:04.630 --> 16:08.030]  Maybe I'm going to say it looks kind of golden goat, but also has the bud shape and the leaf
[16:08.030 --> 16:10.110]  structure of the platinum tangy.
[16:10.110 --> 16:14.150]  You might get different shit like that and that is possible with genetics.
[16:14.150 --> 16:15.430]  That's how it works.
[16:15.430 --> 16:17.130]  So thank you for the great feedback.
[16:17.130 --> 16:24.650]  This one came from our friend who calls themselves SC Dung Slinger 79.
[16:24.650 --> 16:28.610]  I'm guessing that's some organics with the dung slinger and 79 is probably the year you're
[16:28.610 --> 16:31.570]  born and SC is probably South Carolina.
[16:31.570 --> 16:32.570]  I'm just guessing.
[16:32.570 --> 16:36.890]  I am assuming making an ass of myself, but big shout out to our buddy SC Dung Slinger
[16:36.890 --> 16:40.570]  79 hashtag pollen chucked genetics.
[16:40.570 --> 16:45.050]  I do appreciate the respectful arguments are great.
[16:45.050 --> 16:49.050]  The criticism the feedback I invite request and accept that sort of stuff.
[16:49.050 --> 16:52.490]  If you have any questions corrections comments or concerns or feedback, I do love to hear
[16:52.490 --> 16:53.490]  it.
[16:53.490 --> 16:57.130]  The email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[16:57.130 --> 16:58.130]  Don't be shy.
[16:58.130 --> 16:59.130]  Send me some messages.
[16:59.130 --> 17:02.670]  All right, the next message that I've got unfolded here on the table that I'm trying
[17:02.670 --> 17:08.610]  to pull out from underneath the computer comes from our friend Pete and it is a quick one
[17:08.610 --> 17:15.270]  and it says should I hang a battery-powered lantern in the flower and veg tents if my
[17:15.270 --> 17:19.790]  power will be turned power will be turned off for eight hours.
[17:19.790 --> 17:25.570]  The electrical company is replacing an electric pole.
[17:25.570 --> 17:30.470]  No I think that eight hours of off time will be just fine.
[17:30.470 --> 17:35.850]  You can interrupt the daylight cycle and give them this eight hours of off time and they
[17:35.850 --> 17:38.330]  will be okay.
[17:38.550 --> 17:45.090]  What you cannot do is interrupt the dark cycle and expect them to be okay.
[17:45.090 --> 17:46.090]  Excuse me.
[17:46.090 --> 17:47.090]  I'm trying not to burp into the microphone here.
[17:47.090 --> 17:48.090]  All right.
[17:48.090 --> 17:49.510]  I think I'm better.
[17:49.510 --> 17:54.930]  What I wanted to say was you can interrupt the daytime cycle if the plants get extra
[17:54.930 --> 17:56.370]  dark it is okay.
[17:56.370 --> 17:58.170]  They're going to think it was a shady day.
[17:58.170 --> 17:59.930]  I was cloudy or something like that.
[17:59.930 --> 18:02.170]  They just weren't getting as much Sun as they should have.
[18:02.170 --> 18:03.650]  They're going to be like, oh, it's nice and cloudy.
[18:03.650 --> 18:04.850]  It's dreary.
[18:04.850 --> 18:06.570]  They're going to have Netflix and chill that day.
[18:06.570 --> 18:07.950]  They're just going to chill out take a break.
[18:08.570 --> 18:10.830]  You're not going to get the photosynthesis and metabolism.
[18:10.830 --> 18:15.550]  You're not going to get the growth that day that you normally would have, but it's 18
[18:15.550 --> 18:18.950]  hours, 24 hours of light that you're not going to get.
[18:18.950 --> 18:20.030]  Not that big of a deal.
[18:20.030 --> 18:22.150]  It's actually just you're interrupting eight hours.
[18:22.150 --> 18:25.950]  So you can interrupt the daytime with unexpected darkness.
[18:25.950 --> 18:29.470]  I wouldn't do that all the time, but this one time, this one day when they're doing
[18:29.470 --> 18:32.110]  construction, this will not be a problem.
[18:32.110 --> 18:36.390]  Now the other part of this that I want to make sure to say is you cannot interrupt the
[18:36.390 --> 18:37.730]  dark cycle.
[18:37.730 --> 18:41.250]  When those plants are in a flowering phase and you've got them in the dark for 18 or
[18:41.250 --> 18:45.010]  for 12 hours, do not interrupt that 12 hours of darkness.
[18:45.010 --> 18:46.010]  That is more critical.
[18:46.010 --> 18:49.930]  That will cause you problems that could lead to issues down the road.
[18:49.930 --> 18:55.090]  So I do not think you need to hang a battery powered lantern in the flower or veg tents
[18:55.090 --> 18:58.930]  if they're only going to be off for this one day for eight hours, that shouldn't be too
[18:58.930 --> 19:00.310]  big of a deal.
[19:00.310 --> 19:02.610]  You may notice that the tents get a little bit humid.
[19:02.610 --> 19:06.730]  You may need to figure out, open some doors, open some windows, get that humid smell out
[19:06.730 --> 19:10.050]  or humid out of there, but then you're going to get that stanky ass smell.
[19:10.050 --> 19:12.330]  It's going to stink because your carbon filters are not running.
[19:12.330 --> 19:14.830]  You're going to have some things to think about right now.
[19:14.830 --> 19:16.450]  It's only going to be eight hours.
[19:16.450 --> 19:20.090]  The main thing is don't panic and do anything stupid to make it worse.
[19:20.090 --> 19:22.130]  You may just want to leave while the power is out.
[19:22.130 --> 19:24.930]  Just go somewhere else and say, the plant's got to deal with it.
[19:24.930 --> 19:26.050]  I've got to deal with it.
[19:26.050 --> 19:27.290]  The plants will be fine.
[19:27.290 --> 19:31.490]  Eight hours will not destroy your garden, should not cause too many big problems.
[19:31.490 --> 19:36.450]  The main thing when you get back home, reset everything, reset all of your timers, your
[19:36.450 --> 19:37.930]  fans, your air conditioners.
[19:37.930 --> 19:42.210]  Just go check on everything and make sure that the timers are correct and get them back
[19:42.210 --> 19:47.370]  on their regularly scheduled program as soon as possible.
[19:47.370 --> 19:51.490]  Just go make sure that your veg tent timer, your light timer is on.
[19:51.490 --> 19:55.730]  Go make sure that your flower room timer, your flower tent timer is on and set to the
[19:55.730 --> 19:59.630]  time you think it should be and the off and on time that you think it should be.
[19:59.630 --> 20:01.450]  Just go do a little bit of a check.
[20:01.450 --> 20:02.770]  Cover your own ass.
[20:02.770 --> 20:06.930]  If you've got an air conditioner that's on a timer or has some settings, check those
[20:06.930 --> 20:07.930]  settings.
[20:07.930 --> 20:11.490]  Go make sure all your fans and blowers are reset the way that they should be.
[20:11.490 --> 20:12.770]  Then walk around the house.
[20:12.770 --> 20:16.230]  Fix the clock on the microwave, the clock on anything that went off.
[20:16.230 --> 20:20.010]  Most of our stuff's digital and resets itself now, but go fix all the clocks.
[20:20.010 --> 20:21.890]  Go make sure that they're all synced up.
[20:21.890 --> 20:22.890]  Get that shit corrected.
[20:22.890 --> 20:27.370]  All right, so I don't think you need to hang up a battery powered lantern.
[20:27.370 --> 20:28.370]  The plants will be fine.
[20:28.370 --> 20:30.010]  They're just going to think it was a shady day.
[20:30.250 --> 20:34.650]  Again, you guys, you can have darkness during the light cycle.
[20:34.650 --> 20:38.490]  That shouldn't cause you too big of a problem if it is not major for too long.
[20:38.490 --> 20:43.050]  If you're doing it for more than 24 hours or so, it may start to tell your plants it's
[20:43.050 --> 20:48.930]  a good idea to go into flower, but eight to 12 to 14, 20 hours shouldn't be a big deal.
[20:48.930 --> 20:52.850]  What you cannot do is have light during the dark cycle.
[20:52.850 --> 20:55.230]  Do not think about it just like this.
[20:55.230 --> 20:56.690]  During the day, can you take a nap?
[20:56.690 --> 20:57.690]  It'd be totally fine, right?
[20:57.690 --> 20:58.690]  Take a nap.
[20:58.690 --> 20:59.690]  Be cool.
[21:00.370 --> 21:01.370]  All right, so lay down.
[21:01.370 --> 21:02.370]  Get some snoozes.
[21:02.370 --> 21:04.570]  I was going to say some snores and some snoozes at the same time.
[21:04.570 --> 21:06.250]  I'm going to leave that shit in there.
[21:06.250 --> 21:08.390]  That's the kind of day it has been.
[21:08.390 --> 21:09.890]  Make it dark for a few minutes.
[21:09.890 --> 21:13.090]  Get nice and stoned and pass out for like an hour and wake up and feel refreshed.
[21:13.090 --> 21:14.370]  You can do that, right?
[21:14.370 --> 21:17.410]  What if I wake you up for an hour in the middle of the night and expect you to do shit?
[21:17.410 --> 21:18.650]  You're going to be mad at me.
[21:18.650 --> 21:19.930]  The plants feel the same way.
[21:19.930 --> 21:20.970]  They could take a nap.
[21:20.970 --> 21:23.130]  They don't want to get woken up unexpectedly.
[21:23.130 --> 21:24.290]  So that's how the plants operate.
[21:24.290 --> 21:26.810]  All right, my friend Pete, I want to thank you for a great message.
[21:26.810 --> 21:29.050]  You got me rambling for quite a bit on that one.
[21:29.410 --> 21:32.050]  My camera flickered at me and did some weird shit.
[21:32.050 --> 21:34.970]  I really don't want to miss any of this recording.
[21:34.970 --> 21:38.270]  So what I'm going to do, I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[21:38.270 --> 21:42.250]  This may be a short episode, but I don't want to lose this recording because I don't know
[21:42.250 --> 21:44.450]  what's happening with that camera.
[21:44.450 --> 21:48.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[21:48.090 --> 21:51.930]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I want to
[21:51.930 --> 21:57.610]  thank you again for listening to a quick episode 656 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[21:57.610 --> 22:01.090]  Let's all hope to Jah that this makes it to the internet because that camera flickered
[22:01.090 --> 22:03.290]  and I don't know what is going on there.
[22:03.290 --> 22:07.450]  Yeah, make sure you check out my website, iregenetics.com.

[22:40.810 --> 22:42.010]  I don't know what's going on.
[22:42.010 --> 22:44.010]  Let's all hope this makes it to the internet.
[22:44.010 --> 22:48.990]  Let's give a big shout out to my buddy Fiskles Organics and until next time, take a fat dab
[22:48.990 --> 22:50.250]  and give your mom a hug for me.
