[00:44.160 --> 00:46.420]  you have noticed that joining me on the microphone today
[00:46.420 --> 00:48.520]  is a coffee and red-faced white mic.
[00:48.520 --> 00:50.080]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:50.080 --> 00:50.920]  Thanks, man.
[00:50.920 --> 00:52.360]  What's up, everybody?
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.440]  Hope you're having a great evening, bro.
[00:53.440 --> 00:55.200]  I just watched you take a pretty chunky dab there.
[00:55.200 --> 00:56.320]  Watch you cough for a few minutes
[00:56.360 --> 00:58.920]  while I tried to stumble through that seedsherenow ad.
[00:58.920 --> 01:01.440]  That was splendid, the dab and the ad.
[01:01.440 --> 01:04.120]  What did you take a dab of, bro?
[01:04.120 --> 01:07.040]  That was the last of my sour diesel ambrosia
[01:07.040 --> 01:08.520]  from apothecary.
[01:08.520 --> 01:10.680]  Isn't the last dab of something delicious
[01:10.680 --> 01:11.960]  kind of a bittersweet moment?
[01:11.960 --> 01:13.080]  You're like, this is delicious,
[01:13.080 --> 01:15.320]  but it's also the last bite.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.040]  Another one bites the dust.
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.480]  Bomp, bomp, bomp.
[01:18.480 --> 01:19.960]  All right, we're not gonna do that on the podcast.
[01:19.960 --> 01:21.360]  We're gonna stay focused here.
[01:21.360 --> 01:22.320]  A little bit focused,
[01:22.320 --> 01:24.880]  as focused as we get here on two guys coughing.
[01:25.760 --> 01:26.680]  Mike, since you asked,
[01:26.680 --> 01:29.320]  I am smoking Purple Starburst Live Batter
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.360]  from Green Dot Labs.
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.880]  This is a four gram jar.
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.840]  It is now a four gram jar minus two fat dabs.
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.680]  I've taken a couple of this stuff.
[01:35.680 --> 01:37.880]  Well, it's a three and a half gram jar.
[01:37.880 --> 01:40.400]  It's just about three and a half grams at this point.
[01:40.400 --> 01:42.840]  This is a blend of Purple Punch and Skittles
[01:42.840 --> 01:44.600]  and Starburst OG.
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.240]  On the package, the flavor is described
[01:46.240 --> 01:49.640]  as spun sugar, grape, and shampoo.
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.120]  Oddly enough, I didn't read that label
[01:52.120 --> 01:54.320]  before I thought that it tastes like cotton candy
[01:54.360 --> 01:55.480]  and shampoo.
[01:55.480 --> 01:56.800]  I thought it tastes like,
[01:58.120 --> 01:59.520]  when you hug a, I'm really tall,
[01:59.520 --> 02:00.360]  and you're a tall guy too,
[02:00.360 --> 02:01.640]  when you hug a pretty girl,
[02:01.640 --> 02:03.200]  and if you just rest your face on their hair,
[02:03.200 --> 02:05.680]  it always smells like strawberries or pretty shampoo.
[02:05.680 --> 02:07.280]  Don't go all Biden on us.
[02:07.280 --> 02:09.400]  I will not, I've hugged pretty girls,
[02:09.400 --> 02:10.440]  and they smell good.
[02:10.440 --> 02:12.160]  They smell like fucking good shampoo, bro.
[02:12.160 --> 02:13.360]  And that's kind of what this smelled like.
[02:13.360 --> 02:14.920]  It smelled like a fruity good shampoo,
[02:14.920 --> 02:16.280]  like when you hug a pretty girl,
[02:16.280 --> 02:17.880]  or maybe it smelled like Bed Bath & Beyond,
[02:17.880 --> 02:19.320]  like a good candle in there,
[02:19.320 --> 02:20.840]  just to keep myself out of trouble
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.040]  with Mike and the pretty ladies.
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.520]  But it smells like girl shampoo.
[02:23.520 --> 02:24.560]  It smells really good.
[02:24.560 --> 02:26.680]  Obviously, it's got me stoned and rambly.
[02:26.680 --> 02:27.680]  On the back of the package,
[02:27.680 --> 02:31.240]  it says it contains 54.84% THC
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.600]  and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.160]  That is not a really high number of THC,
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.520]  but it got me stoned.
[02:37.520 --> 02:40.160]  And I'm going, I'm gonna assume the rest of that is terse,
[02:40.160 --> 02:43.600]  because it is fruity and fragrant and pungent.
[02:43.600 --> 02:44.520]  When I open the jar,
[02:44.520 --> 02:47.160]  I can smell it from a distance from my face.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.640]  I don't have to put this one up to the nose
[02:48.640 --> 02:49.480]  to give it a sniff.
[02:49.480 --> 02:51.680]  I can smell it from quite a ways away.
[02:51.680 --> 02:52.520]  So that's what I'm smoking.
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.480]  Purple Starburst.
[02:53.480 --> 02:54.760]  Mine is not the last dab.
[02:54.760 --> 02:55.680]  This is a fresh jar,
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.240]  so we get to enjoy this for a little while.
[02:59.240 --> 03:00.960]  All right, Mike, this is the point in the show
[03:00.960 --> 03:02.800]  where we do a shout out to the folks
[03:02.800 --> 03:04.680]  who support the show on Patreon.
[03:04.680 --> 03:08.080]  We are still under a corona type of an environment,
[03:08.080 --> 03:09.760]  so I'm not gonna smoke a bowl with you guys,
[03:09.760 --> 03:12.920]  but I will pack you up digital bong rips and digital dabs.
[03:12.920 --> 03:16.400]  We'll roll up some digital joints, some digital blunts,
[03:16.400 --> 03:17.840]  and we're gonna pass those all out.
[03:17.840 --> 03:19.560]  Let's start off with a giant shout out
[03:19.560 --> 03:21.600]  to our buddy, The Stoned Trout Bomb.
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.400]  Big shout out, thank you for all the support.
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.880]  I wanna send a giant thank you shout out to Nurse Geek.
[03:25.880 --> 03:27.600]  I wanna send a thank you to Nick.
[03:27.600 --> 03:29.320]  I've always got a giant thank you shout out
[03:29.320 --> 03:31.000]  and a fist bump to our friend Nick.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.360]  Also to Justin.
[03:32.360 --> 03:33.840]  A big thank you to Jose.
[03:33.840 --> 03:35.840]  We've got a big thank you to Rick Roller.
[03:35.840 --> 03:37.720]  A big thank you high five to Sam.
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.840]  I wrote down Nick again.
[03:39.840 --> 03:41.560]  Nick, you got three shout outs in a row
[03:41.560 --> 03:43.160]  because I'm fucking stoned.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.120]  Good job, brother.
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.640]  Also, let's send a big shout out to our friend Sour D,
[03:46.640 --> 03:48.640]  always killing it with the great photos.
[03:49.640 --> 03:50.800]  I wanna send a big thank you shout out
[03:51.000 --> 03:51.840]  to my buddy Tanner M.
[03:51.840 --> 03:54.000]  Tanner's been supporting us for a really long time.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.640]  And last, but certainly not least,
[03:55.640 --> 03:58.320]  I've got a giant fist bump and a thank you shout out
[03:58.320 --> 04:01.320]  to our friend Spruce Hill Farm.
[04:01.320 --> 04:03.400]  Big thank you for all of the support.

[04:45.600 --> 04:47.960]  He's got a lot to do with my success in cannabis.

[04:51.880 --> 04:55.560]  www.patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[04:55.560 --> 04:57.360]  I feel like that's all the, oh man, thank you, bro.
[04:57.360 --> 04:59.040]  You've been here for a long time.
[04:59.040 --> 05:00.360]  It's good to finally get you on camera.
[05:00.360 --> 05:03.640]  So we got to get you some rewards for all your hard work.
[05:05.280 --> 05:08.240]  I have a lot of great emails planned up for the show.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.520]  Do you want to jump right into these
[05:09.520 --> 05:12.840]  or do you think we should do some rambling first, Mike?
[05:12.840 --> 05:15.240]  Let's dive right in and see where the email takes us.
[05:15.240 --> 05:16.160]  Let's dive right in.
[05:16.160 --> 05:17.000]  I like your approach.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.600]  Seems like a responsible thing.
[05:18.640 --> 05:20.680]  Sometimes you've got random shit on your brain to spout out
[05:20.680 --> 05:23.240]  and I just wanted to see where your brain went today.
[05:23.240 --> 05:25.200]  Speaking of Patreon contributors,
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.880]  this one did come from a new Patreon supporter.
[05:27.880 --> 05:30.240]  Big shout out to our friend Totally White Tops.
[05:30.240 --> 05:32.160]  They sent us this message on Patreon
[05:32.160 --> 05:34.480]  and it goes a lot like this.
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.800]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[05:35.800 --> 05:38.480]  I hope all is well out there in Colorado.
[05:38.480 --> 05:39.760]  All is irie, bro.
[05:39.760 --> 05:41.240]  Thank you for checking on us.
[05:41.240 --> 05:43.040]  We're keeping to ourselves, behaving ourselves,
[05:43.040 --> 05:44.800]  trying to stay safe and healthy.
[05:44.800 --> 05:45.920]  Mike's kicking with the fam.
[05:45.920 --> 05:47.480]  Obviously we're recording over Zoom.
[05:47.480 --> 05:50.160]  So we're doing our best to stay safe.
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.800]  This says, I'm a somewhat new grower up here in Michigan
[05:53.800 --> 05:56.320]  with just a couple of grows under my belt.
[05:56.320 --> 05:57.280]  Bro, welcome to the gang.
[05:57.280 --> 05:59.280]  Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[05:59.280 --> 06:02.160]  Even Bruce Lee started off as a white belt at one point.
[06:02.160 --> 06:04.560]  It says, I recently got some of your lemon Jeffrey
[06:04.560 --> 06:08.520]  and orange chasm seeds and I've popped three of each.
[06:08.520 --> 06:09.440]  That is a great start.
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.440]  You've got a really good,
[06:10.440 --> 06:12.120]  the orange chasm will be really easy to grow.
[06:12.120 --> 06:15.280]  The lemon Jeffrey, not as easy, but still it will be a breeze
[06:15.280 --> 06:17.080]  because you've been listening to the show.
[06:17.080 --> 06:19.280]  It says, I can't wait to see what these,
[06:19.280 --> 06:21.400]  what I can do with these lovely ladies.
[06:21.400 --> 06:23.760]  I plan on running each of the strains separately
[06:23.760 --> 06:26.160]  in two by four by six tents.
[06:26.160 --> 06:28.760]  So I'm hoping that's a two foot wide by four foot deep
[06:28.760 --> 06:32.320]  by six foot tall tent, probably in three gallon radical bags.
[06:32.320 --> 06:33.960]  That sounds like a good setup.
[06:33.960 --> 06:36.680]  My question to you is, with only having about five feet
[06:36.680 --> 06:39.440]  to work with for height wise, due to my lights
[06:39.440 --> 06:41.680]  and carbon filters at the top of the tent,
[06:41.680 --> 06:44.720]  at what height would you suggest flipping my ladies
[06:44.720 --> 06:47.520]  from flower to veg so they don't stretch too far
[06:47.520 --> 06:49.000]  and grow up out of control?
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.080]  Thanks for any help and suggestions, man.
[06:51.080 --> 06:53.800]  Growers love and stay iry.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.480]  Tip, are totally white tops.
[06:55.480 --> 06:57.720]  Thank you, this is a great question.
[06:57.720 --> 06:59.880]  Thank you for the Patreon support.
[06:59.880 --> 07:03.320]  Growers love back at you and you stay iry as well.
[07:03.320 --> 07:06.200]  Mike, we can shine some good light on this question.
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.840]  They're asking, well, they've got two different strains.
[07:09.840 --> 07:12.280]  So I'm gonna have to do two different analysis
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.600]  is here or breakdowns, but they're planning.
[07:15.480 --> 07:17.320]  So 18 to 24, right?
[07:17.320 --> 07:19.240]  18, say that again, bro.
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.880]  So 18 to 24 inches.
[07:20.880 --> 07:22.560]  But I would go, yeah, somewhere around there.
[07:22.560 --> 07:24.800]  They've got, but they've got individual tents.
[07:24.800 --> 07:26.760]  They've got, they're gonna run them separately.
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.400]  I was gonna ask if that's what I heard.
[07:28.400 --> 07:30.600]  It sounds like, that sounded like what you said.
[07:30.600 --> 07:32.840]  So they've got six individual tents?
[07:32.840 --> 07:36.600]  I think they're not gonna run them in six different tents.
[07:36.600 --> 07:38.400]  They're gonna run the strains separately
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.320]  and two by four tents.
[07:39.320 --> 07:40.800]  So they've probably got two tents,
[07:40.800 --> 07:42.520]  but either way, the advantage that I see there
[07:42.520 --> 07:44.160]  is that we've got the Orange Gasam in one
[07:44.720 --> 07:45.560]  and the Lemon Jeffrey in the other,
[07:45.560 --> 07:46.920]  which is really helpful because they don't grow the same.
[07:46.920 --> 07:48.840]  One gets, the Lemon gets quite tall.
[07:48.840 --> 07:50.880]  The Orange Gasam stays a little bit shorter,
[07:50.880 --> 07:51.960]  a little bit squatter.
[07:51.960 --> 07:54.560]  So doing them separately is going to really help you out.
[07:54.560 --> 07:56.200]  That's a good move there.
[07:56.200 --> 07:59.280]  The Lemon Jeffrey will double.
[07:59.280 --> 08:02.240]  You can count on that plant doubling in height
[08:02.240 --> 08:03.800]  during the flowering phase.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.800]  Within about the first three weeks of flower,
[08:05.800 --> 08:07.840]  it is really going to take off.
[08:07.840 --> 08:09.800]  If you do popping and twisting techniques,
[08:09.800 --> 08:11.240]  I'm sure you've listened to the show.
[08:11.240 --> 08:13.480]  If you grab the plant at one point, grab it at another,
[08:13.480 --> 08:14.960]  give it a twist right in the middle there,
[08:14.960 --> 08:15.800]  it's gonna pop.
[08:15.800 --> 08:17.040]  It sounds like a knuckle.
[08:17.040 --> 08:18.360]  Sounds just like that.
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.920]  Do that all the way up the plant.
[08:19.920 --> 08:22.440]  That will slow down that stretch.
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.640]  The plant will focus on repairing that growth.
[08:24.640 --> 08:26.040]  You're not slowing down any bud growth.
[08:26.040 --> 08:27.280]  The plant would be stretching anyway.
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.120]  The hormones are kind of shifting over.
[08:29.120 --> 08:30.560]  That will help slow down that stretch.
[08:30.560 --> 08:33.880]  But that Lemon Jeffrey is going to double in size
[08:33.880 --> 08:35.640]  by the time it is done flowering.
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.240]  So be ready for a double in size.
[08:37.240 --> 08:39.360]  You said you've got a six foot tall tent,
[08:39.360 --> 08:41.960]  probably five feet tall with the light.
[08:42.200 --> 08:43.760]  What about the height of the pot?
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.960]  So I would say whatever height you've got,
[08:45.960 --> 08:47.840]  measure that from the pot to the light
[08:47.840 --> 08:49.160]  and then cut that in half.
[08:50.600 --> 08:53.520]  So if you've got whatever it is, 40 inches.
[08:53.520 --> 08:55.160]  I'd go a little more than half.
[08:55.160 --> 08:56.440]  We need a little less than half.
[08:56.440 --> 08:57.760]  Leave yourself a cushion.
[08:57.760 --> 08:59.520]  Because we don't wanna be touching the lights.
[08:59.520 --> 09:01.400]  We need some space away from that light.
[09:01.400 --> 09:03.160]  So Mike makes a very good point there.
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.760]  Plants don't like to kiss the light.
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.800]  That is very, very true.
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.240]  Now let's talk about the orange chasm.
[09:08.240 --> 09:09.960]  The orange chasm is going to stretch,
[09:09.960 --> 09:13.000]  but not as radically as the Lemon Jeffrey.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.680]  I would say a third, maybe not double,
[09:15.680 --> 09:17.240]  but it will get a third as tall.
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.680]  A little more than a quarter, a little less than half.
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.440]  So measure your space and flower that accordingly.
[09:22.440 --> 09:24.480]  But now something I would really recommend,
[09:24.480 --> 09:27.440]  if you're in a tent, if you're in a two by four by six tent,
[09:27.440 --> 09:30.160]  it will be really, really easy to trellis that down
[09:30.160 --> 09:31.800]  and fill that space.
[09:31.800 --> 09:34.520]  So you could grow it up to where it's a few inches tall,
[09:34.520 --> 09:37.760]  then put a screen down and spread it out horizontally
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.520]  instead of vertically until you've got
[09:39.520 --> 09:41.080]  all of that space filled up.
[09:41.080 --> 09:42.360]  If you had a box and I said,
[09:42.360 --> 09:44.120]  put as much weed as you can in there,
[09:44.120 --> 09:45.480]  would you just put a bunch of spears
[09:45.480 --> 09:47.040]  or would you try to layer that shit?
[09:47.040 --> 09:50.360]  So let's try to fill the space the best we can with,
[09:50.360 --> 09:52.000]  you've only got two by four by six,
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.400]  almost any light is going to get that spread.
[09:54.400 --> 09:57.600]  So let's trellis them down and get them going horizontally
[09:57.600 --> 09:59.600]  and then put another net where when they grow up,
[09:59.600 --> 10:00.800]  they grow into that net.
[10:00.800 --> 10:03.480]  That is going to buy you a lot more space.
[10:03.480 --> 10:05.760]  It doesn't look like a lot more space until you do it
[10:05.760 --> 10:07.680]  and then you realize how much more plant
[10:07.680 --> 10:08.520]  is actually in there,
[10:08.520 --> 10:10.360]  how much more biomass can actually grow
[10:10.360 --> 10:11.960]  once you spread it out.
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.520]  So the Lemon Jeff is gonna double.
[10:14.520 --> 10:16.760]  The other one is going to about grow about a third.
[10:16.760 --> 10:19.400]  I know it's what's that about 70.75.
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.520]  I don't even know how to do the math on that.
[10:21.520 --> 10:23.280]  Not as big as the Lemon Jeffrey,
[10:23.280 --> 10:25.040]  but I would recommend in those tents,
[10:25.040 --> 10:27.120]  scrogging them out so that you can control them
[10:27.120 --> 10:27.960]  a little bit more.
[10:27.960 --> 10:29.720]  You can keep them short in the beginning,
[10:29.720 --> 10:32.400]  you can bend them down and then when it's time to flower,
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.560]  just give yourself plenty of flowering space
[10:34.560 --> 10:35.640]  and then put another net up
[10:35.640 --> 10:37.840]  so they can grow into that net for supports.
[10:39.320 --> 10:40.280]  Any input on that Mike?
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.480]  You look like you had something to say.
[10:41.480 --> 10:42.320]  I don't wanna cut you off.
[10:42.320 --> 10:44.120]  No, the scrogging was a good idea.
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.280]  I didn't even consider it.
[10:45.280 --> 10:47.280]  Yeah, when you're in that small of a space
[10:47.280 --> 10:48.200]  and you're worried about height,
[10:48.200 --> 10:49.360]  why not scrog them down
[10:49.360 --> 10:50.840]  and then you've got full control of it.
[10:50.840 --> 10:52.000]  That makes sense.
[10:52.000 --> 10:52.920]  Yeah, and then when you flip them,
[10:52.920 --> 10:54.080]  they'll start growing straight up
[10:54.080 --> 10:56.080]  and you've got all that space filled up.
[10:56.080 --> 10:57.960]  When you look in there, it's just rows of colas
[10:57.960 --> 11:00.040]  instead of just a few sparse buds.
[11:00.040 --> 11:03.360]  I think it'll really make a big improvement in the garden.
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.200]  Totally white tops.
[11:04.200 --> 11:05.440]  I hope I answered your question.
[11:05.440 --> 11:07.840]  I do appreciate the great message
[11:07.880 --> 11:11.600]  and huge thank you for the generous Patreon support.
[11:11.600 --> 11:12.440]  I do appreciate that.
[11:12.440 --> 11:14.600]  I saw that today and I do appreciate it.
[11:14.600 --> 11:15.440]  Thank you.
[11:16.520 --> 11:18.520]  All right, I do have another email here in front of me.
[11:18.520 --> 11:20.600]  Mike, this one will definitely get your attention.
[11:20.600 --> 11:21.440]  I keep scratching my nose.
[11:21.440 --> 11:23.920]  I'm just gonna take a minute and try to get the itch.
[11:23.920 --> 11:24.800]  There we go.
[11:24.800 --> 11:27.520]  Yeah, I'm just gonna take a minute to scratch that shit.
[11:27.520 --> 11:28.760]  Excuse me if you're watching the video.
[11:28.760 --> 11:30.600]  My nose itched really badly.
[11:30.600 --> 11:31.440]  Got another email.
[11:31.440 --> 11:34.760]  This one comes from, they said their name is Brandy.
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.120]  I hope I can say their name, but it says,
[11:37.240 --> 11:38.160]  it says right here,
[11:38.160 --> 11:40.440]  hey, Ross to Jeff, you can use my name on the show
[11:40.440 --> 11:41.840]  should my question make it on.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.680]  Well, shout out Brandy.
[11:42.680 --> 11:45.040]  I'm gonna use your message and say your name.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.120]  It says, I love the show
[11:46.120 --> 11:48.080]  and I'm glad to be a Patreon member.
[11:48.080 --> 11:51.360]  I've learned 50% of what I know about growing from you
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.680]  and I've taken so many notes from listening
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.920]  and re-listening to the information.
[11:55.920 --> 11:56.760]  That is awesome.
[11:56.760 --> 11:58.320]  So much great shit in there.
[11:58.320 --> 12:01.080]  Patreon contributor, I appreciate that for sure.
[12:01.080 --> 12:04.120]  And 50% of what you learned, you have learned from me.
[12:04.120 --> 12:06.680]  That means your garden probably looks a lot like my grow
[12:06.760 --> 12:08.240]  and that makes me smile
[12:08.240 --> 12:11.040]  and I hope you're doing a really good job.
[12:11.040 --> 12:12.920]  And thank you for listening and re-listening.
[12:12.920 --> 12:15.240]  You go back and re-listen, that is awesome.
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.640]  Some people just, they think they learned it
[12:16.640 --> 12:17.480]  all the first time.
[12:17.480 --> 12:18.760]  So you're going back, that is cool.
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.760]  It says, hands down, my favorite weed podcast.
[12:20.760 --> 12:22.360]  Thank you for all the work you do.
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.640]  I'm loving the Zoom shows.
[12:24.640 --> 12:25.640]  There we go, Mike.
[12:25.640 --> 12:27.520]  People are loving what we're doing.
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.400]  Shout out to Mike for joining me on those.
[12:29.400 --> 12:30.960]  It says, my question is quick.
[12:30.960 --> 12:32.960]  We're gonna make it kind of long though.
[12:32.960 --> 12:35.080]  I went to a medical dispensary in Oklahoma
[12:35.080 --> 12:36.320]  a couple of days ago.
[12:36.880 --> 12:37.720]  We're not gonna say it.
[12:37.720 --> 12:39.960]  Okay, I drove up from Missouri where I have a medical card
[12:39.960 --> 12:42.480]  and I'm able to use it in Oklahoma for a few.
[12:42.480 --> 12:43.600]  That's pretty cool.
[12:43.600 --> 12:46.240]  Reciprocity is a great advantage
[12:46.240 --> 12:48.600]  and addition to medical cannabis.
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.480]  I was going to load my bowl this morning
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.000]  with some Blue Dream and I found a shit ton of seeds
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.400]  in my weed.
[12:55.400 --> 12:56.920]  So they bought some dispensary weed.
[12:56.920 --> 12:57.800]  They got some Blue Dream.
[12:57.800 --> 12:59.480]  They went to pack a bowl and they went.
[12:59.480 --> 13:00.320]  It was seedy.
[13:00.320 --> 13:03.120]  To tink, tink, tink, tink, tink into the tray.
[13:03.120 --> 13:04.800]  It says, after I messed around with the weed
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.840]  and it's all crumbly and dark green
[13:06.840 --> 13:09.480]  and almost yellow in color.
[13:09.480 --> 13:10.600]  So they got some very, yeah,
[13:10.600 --> 13:12.160]  the face you're making Mike is accurate.
[13:12.160 --> 13:15.040]  Some very subpar, disappointing product
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.080]  that still probably costs top dollar.
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.680]  Test, test, okey.
[13:18.680 --> 13:21.160]  Says at first I was happy because I scored some seeds
[13:21.160 --> 13:23.440]  but now I'm feeling a little duped and gypped
[13:23.440 --> 13:25.400]  because my entire ounce pack I bought
[13:25.400 --> 13:28.520]  seems to be loaded with seeds.
[13:28.520 --> 13:29.360]  Yeah, that's bullshit.
[13:29.360 --> 13:32.400]  That's unacceptable unless it is clearly labeled
[13:32.400 --> 13:33.560]  seed in a product.
[13:33.600 --> 13:35.960]  There should be minimal seeds in there.
[13:35.960 --> 13:39.000]  You should find one seed per ounce at maximum.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.640]  Other than that, it's unacceptable.
[13:40.640 --> 13:41.920]  Yeah, you don't even want that one,
[13:41.920 --> 13:42.880]  but I mean shit happens.
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.640]  One seed per ounce is, that's a good seed.
[13:45.640 --> 13:47.600]  A bunch of them are a pain in the ass.
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.200]  I says, I'm wondering, is this normal
[13:50.200 --> 13:52.560]  for typical medical dispensaries
[13:52.560 --> 13:56.040]  or is it weird for my medicine to have so many seeds in it?
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.240]  Go ahead, Mike.
[13:58.240 --> 13:59.680]  Somebody screwed the pooch
[13:59.680 --> 14:02.800]  and you got out of state ID tagged.
[14:02.840 --> 14:03.920]  Oh, do you think that's what they did?
[14:03.920 --> 14:05.320]  They're like, this person's not from here
[14:05.320 --> 14:07.040]  so let's just give them a shit bag.
[14:07.040 --> 14:08.880]  Yeah, you're here for how long?
[14:08.880 --> 14:11.240]  Yeah, get the other jar.
[14:11.240 --> 14:12.200]  Maybe.
[14:12.200 --> 14:13.280]  Yeah, that's possible.
[14:13.280 --> 14:15.360]  Sorry, that's my take.
[14:15.360 --> 14:17.640]  Yeah, or maybe this dispensary just has
[14:17.640 --> 14:19.000]  a bunch of shitty seeded weed
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.400]  and that's what they're selling.
[14:21.400 --> 14:23.520]  They wrap it up with, thanks man, keep being iry.
[14:23.520 --> 14:25.280]  I'm half Jamaican, big respect.
[14:25.280 --> 14:27.120]  Island love, it says lots of love to you and yours
[14:27.120 --> 14:28.800]  from the Midwest, signed Brandy.
[14:28.800 --> 14:31.920]  Hey Brandy, you should not have gotten any seeds
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.320]  in your product from a medical marijuana dispensary.
[14:35.320 --> 14:36.360]  Somebody had a problem.
[14:36.360 --> 14:39.800]  They had a light leak, they had a hermaphroditic plant,
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.320]  they had a male plant, who knows what went wrong,
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.200]  but that's a problem.
[14:44.200 --> 14:46.440]  I would go to Weed Maps and I would leave a solid review.
[14:46.440 --> 14:47.760]  Don't be rude about it.
[14:47.760 --> 14:48.600]  Just say.
[14:48.600 --> 14:51.040]  Start with an email, reach out
[14:51.040 --> 14:52.960]  because maybe it was an honest mistake
[14:52.960 --> 14:55.440]  and maybe they want to take care of it right.
[14:55.440 --> 14:58.040]  But when they don't, that's what the next.
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.360]  Mike, you've processed a lot of medical cannabis
[15:02.360 --> 15:04.120]  at more than one facility.
[15:04.120 --> 15:07.560]  How many times would you not notice
[15:07.560 --> 15:09.120]  an ounce loaded with seeds?
[15:09.120 --> 15:09.960]  Never.
[15:09.960 --> 15:13.280]  I don't want to bash a dispensary, but if they missed.
[15:13.280 --> 15:14.160]  They knew they had seeded.
[15:14.160 --> 15:15.040]  They knew what they did.
[15:15.040 --> 15:16.000]  It's not worth the email.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.840]  They already knew what they did.
[15:17.840 --> 15:19.200]  Like it's not worth it.
[15:19.200 --> 15:20.040]  They already fucked them.
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.920]  I'd go to Weed Maps and say, hey, this happened to me.
[15:21.920 --> 15:23.760]  Make sure you don't go there.
[15:23.760 --> 15:25.800]  They had the opportunity to make it right the first time.
[15:25.800 --> 15:27.840]  If you want to send the email, if you're a kind person,
[15:28.640 --> 15:29.920]  if you're real gentle and patient, go for it.
[15:29.920 --> 15:31.760]  But they knew what they put in there.
[15:31.760 --> 15:33.880]  It's like if a chef serves you raw fish,
[15:33.880 --> 15:35.040]  fucking chef knew he was lazy.
[15:35.040 --> 15:35.880]  He knew that fish was raw.
[15:35.880 --> 15:39.000]  I'd definitely hit him up and contact him and say,
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.400]  hey, I picked up an ounce, it's seedy.
[15:42.400 --> 15:43.960]  What are you going to do for me?
[15:43.960 --> 15:47.440]  And I'd have Weed Maps open and I'd be writing the comment,
[15:47.440 --> 15:49.480]  roasting them while I was on the phone with them.
[15:49.480 --> 15:50.320]  Yeah.
[15:50.320 --> 15:51.160]  And take a picture.
[15:51.160 --> 15:52.280]  Delete it if they do it right.
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.400]  If they don't do you right, let the world know.
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.160]  This is where you go to get seedy product for full price?
[16:00.160 --> 16:03.240]  Yeah, because I'm sure they didn't give you a seeded discount.
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.080]  No, I was just in a shop the other day and I smiled
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.360]  because on the shelf they had clearly labeled
[16:10.360 --> 16:14.200]  on their discount shelf, this is outdoor that got seeded.
[16:14.200 --> 16:16.320]  And the price was a little less than half
[16:16.320 --> 16:19.880]  of what the same quality jar right next to it was
[16:19.880 --> 16:21.400]  that wasn't seeded.
[16:21.400 --> 16:22.440]  But have it clearly labeled.
[16:22.440 --> 16:23.440]  That's perfectly fine.
[16:23.440 --> 16:25.120]  That's completely acceptable.
[16:25.120 --> 16:26.960]  If I say, seeds in this world.
[16:26.960 --> 16:28.720]  The consumer has been dealing with seeds for forever.
[16:28.720 --> 16:29.920]  It's part of the plant.
[16:32.040 --> 16:35.640]  But it's bait and switching people is just wrong.
[16:35.640 --> 16:37.280]  It used to be part of the ritual.
[16:37.280 --> 16:39.840]  You used to buy your bag of weed and then go home
[16:39.840 --> 16:40.840]  and then do your process.
[16:40.840 --> 16:41.680]  However you do it.
[16:41.680 --> 16:43.880]  I got to go get all the seeds out of this.
[16:43.880 --> 16:45.760]  Getting home and going through a bag
[16:45.760 --> 16:47.360]  and getting all the seeds and stems out.
[16:47.360 --> 16:48.960]  It was like a way to pass time in high school.
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.680]  Put on some whatever you listen to and some Grateful Dead
[16:51.680 --> 16:52.880]  and pick the seeds out of my weed
[16:52.880 --> 16:54.400]  and smoke a couple of bong loads.
[16:54.600 --> 16:59.600]  Everybody had a special dish or a tray or a magazine.
[17:00.200 --> 17:01.040]  Something.
[17:01.040 --> 17:03.080]  A bunch of my friends thought they had to have an album cover
[17:03.080 --> 17:04.480]  just because they all tried to be hippies.
[17:04.480 --> 17:06.280]  So they all had a either it was either the wall
[17:06.280 --> 17:07.480]  or Terrapin station.
[17:07.480 --> 17:08.920]  So all my shout outs all my hippie friends.
[17:08.920 --> 17:10.200]  You know who you fucking are guys.
[17:10.200 --> 17:11.040]  What's up?
[17:11.040 --> 17:11.880]  I love you.
[17:11.880 --> 17:12.720]  I miss you guys.
[17:12.720 --> 17:13.560]  Let's go ride around in the van and get lit.
[17:14.600 --> 17:15.440]  Oh man.
[17:15.440 --> 17:16.440]  I'll put on my Genco's.
[17:16.440 --> 17:17.880]  Mike is still wearing his.
[17:18.920 --> 17:19.760]  Yeah.
[17:19.760 --> 17:20.800]  I had a little dog dish.
[17:20.800 --> 17:21.920]  Those were good days.
[17:21.920 --> 17:23.400]  Nice.
[17:23.400 --> 17:24.880]  But there should not have been any seeds in there.
[17:24.880 --> 17:26.680]  So take a picture of that.
[17:26.680 --> 17:29.320]  So that when you do decide to contact whoever
[17:29.320 --> 17:30.480]  that you've got a photo of it,
[17:30.480 --> 17:32.040]  take a picture of the product
[17:32.040 --> 17:33.480]  and then don't go to that place again.
[17:33.480 --> 17:35.760]  Like there are a lot of shops in Oklahoma.
[17:35.760 --> 17:37.400]  So go there and check them out.
[17:37.400 --> 17:39.200]  See what you can find.
[17:39.200 --> 17:42.880]  And also there are a lot of shops in Colorado.
[17:42.880 --> 17:44.680]  So make sure you visit Colorado
[17:44.680 --> 17:46.720]  and check out some of the recreational shops.
[17:46.720 --> 17:49.240]  Make sure you don't travel home with any illegal medicine.
[17:49.240 --> 17:50.520]  Just have to say that as you know,
[17:50.520 --> 17:51.680]  podcaster and all that shit.
[17:51.680 --> 17:54.400]  The Ross to Jeff and white Mike are fictional characters.
[17:54.400 --> 17:56.720]  So good luck.
[17:56.720 --> 17:59.920]  But now the question that I have Mike is about those seeds.
[17:59.920 --> 18:01.760]  At first it sounded like our friend Brandy
[18:01.760 --> 18:03.640]  was a little bit excited at one sentence.
[18:03.640 --> 18:05.320]  They could be a lot of things.
[18:05.320 --> 18:06.160]  Yeah.
[18:06.160 --> 18:07.560]  I was happy because I scored some seeds
[18:07.560 --> 18:09.600]  but now I'm feeling duped and gypped.
[18:10.840 --> 18:11.680]  Yeah.
[18:11.680 --> 18:12.520]  How should they look if they're good?
[18:12.520 --> 18:14.960]  And what do they look like if they're crap Jeff?
[18:14.960 --> 18:16.680]  Well, if there are crap seeds, they'll be white.
[18:16.680 --> 18:17.720]  They'll be if the,
[18:17.720 --> 18:20.000]  but it's not about what the seeds look like.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.200]  That's like doing a fucking COVID-19 test
[18:22.200 --> 18:23.640]  of visually over zoom.
[18:23.640 --> 18:26.040]  Like I can't tell if you've got COVID or not.
[18:26.040 --> 18:28.880]  You can, you can, if they're fat tiger stripes,
[18:28.880 --> 18:29.800]  you're in the money.
[18:29.800 --> 18:31.920]  If they're big and fat dark seeds.
[18:31.920 --> 18:33.400]  Yeah. You might want to try to grow them.
[18:33.400 --> 18:35.600]  If they're white and tiny and you can tell if they crush
[18:35.600 --> 18:36.880]  when you squeeze them really lightly,
[18:36.880 --> 18:39.960]  those are dead, dull, non-viable seeds.
[18:39.960 --> 18:41.920]  If you do choose to grow them,
[18:41.920 --> 18:43.680]  you sounded excited like you might be interested
[18:43.680 --> 18:44.520]  in growing them.
[18:44.520 --> 18:45.440]  Do grow them.
[18:45.440 --> 18:46.880]  If you've got room and space
[18:46.880 --> 18:48.040]  and if you're not going to get in trouble,
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.320]  but keep in mind that you have got a wild card there.
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.400]  You don't know why those seeds occurred in that garden.
[18:55.400 --> 18:57.200]  Was there a male that got out of control?
[18:57.200 --> 18:59.640]  That is the best case scenario for you
[18:59.640 --> 19:01.840]  as the consumer with the seeds for everybody else.
[19:01.840 --> 19:03.080]  That's the worst case scenario.
[19:03.080 --> 19:06.400]  But if there was a male that got missed and it pollinated,
[19:06.400 --> 19:08.760]  you've got a male female cross,
[19:08.760 --> 19:11.640]  which is the best case for you in that grow.
[19:11.640 --> 19:14.120]  That means your seeds are going to be the most viable,
[19:14.120 --> 19:14.960]  the most successful.
[19:14.960 --> 19:17.120]  There will be boys and girls in there,
[19:17.120 --> 19:20.320]  but they won't be terrible mutants, hopefully, possibly.
[19:20.320 --> 19:22.400]  You could have a hermaphroditic problem
[19:22.400 --> 19:23.560]  that caused these seeds.
[19:23.560 --> 19:26.320]  A female plant could have been stressed in a way,
[19:26.320 --> 19:28.960]  or it could have just been triggered to show intersex
[19:28.960 --> 19:29.960]  or hermaphroditic traits,
[19:29.960 --> 19:31.560]  and it would have thrown out male sacks.
[19:31.560 --> 19:33.240]  It would have created pollen.
[19:33.240 --> 19:36.240]  That's a lot of seeds for a herm plant.
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.320]  If you got like enough to be pissed off about,
[19:38.320 --> 19:39.720]  like if you really got a bunch,
[19:39.720 --> 19:41.440]  that means that plant really hermed out on you.
[19:41.440 --> 19:43.160]  It really spit out a lot of pollen.
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.480]  So then at that rate, you have got the opportunity,
[19:46.480 --> 19:48.760]  the potential to have straight up hermaphrodites,
[19:48.760 --> 19:50.840]  or also feminized seeds,
[19:50.840 --> 19:54.120]  or also straight up crazy fucking mutants.
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.200]  There are a lot of variables here.
[19:56.200 --> 19:58.200]  You could have really good feminized seeds also.
[19:58.200 --> 19:59.160]  It's a real wild card.
[19:59.160 --> 20:00.000]  Yeah.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.840]  The only way you're really going to know is to grow them.
[20:03.840 --> 20:04.840]  You got to grow them out.
[20:04.840 --> 20:06.800]  So if you've got some space,
[20:06.800 --> 20:09.400]  now if you're relying on a grow for medicine,
[20:09.400 --> 20:10.960]  or for product, or for profit,
[20:10.960 --> 20:13.400]  if you can't do it as a hobby and a passion project
[20:13.400 --> 20:15.760]  and kind of a science experiment, I wouldn't grow these.
[20:15.800 --> 20:17.240]  If you were tight on money
[20:17.240 --> 20:19.080]  and you can't afford a little bit of electricity,
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.920]  some nutrients, don't grow these.
[20:20.920 --> 20:22.800]  Get some reliable seeds from a seed bank.
[20:22.800 --> 20:25.520]  Seedsherenow.com, coupon code GFYH10.
[20:25.520 --> 20:27.920]  Get some reliable seeds from a breeder that you can trust,
[20:27.920 --> 20:29.120]  that has packaging.
[20:29.120 --> 20:32.480]  What you've got are like, those are like pound puppies.
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.520]  We don't know the pedigree.
[20:33.520 --> 20:34.600]  We don't know where they came from.
[20:34.600 --> 20:35.680]  They could have been beat to shit.
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.440]  They could be just ready to bite you.
[20:37.440 --> 20:38.680]  We have no idea what you got there.
[20:38.680 --> 20:39.680]  So you might want something that came
[20:39.680 --> 20:41.320]  from a breeder with some pedigree.
[20:41.320 --> 20:43.560]  But like I said, if it's not going to set you back to grow it,
[20:43.560 --> 20:45.480]  if it's free, if you've got time for a hobby,
[20:46.160 --> 20:47.440]  if you can afford some soil, some electricity
[20:47.440 --> 20:48.760]  and some dedication, grow them.
[20:48.760 --> 20:49.920]  It could be fun.
[20:49.920 --> 20:53.360]  When you grow them, keep a strong eye out for problems
[20:53.360 --> 20:56.120]  early, early on, especially the first,
[20:56.120 --> 20:57.720]  especially all the way through flower.
[20:57.720 --> 21:01.120]  Early in flower, you should see male flowers pop up.
[21:01.120 --> 21:03.680]  Yeah, you'll see the males, you'll find the guys,
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.520]  you'll pull those out.
[21:04.520 --> 21:06.280]  Hopefully the hermaphrodites will show themselves.
[21:06.280 --> 21:07.520]  You get rid of those.
[21:07.520 --> 21:09.800]  Then see if the girls that are growing are worth a shit.
[21:09.800 --> 21:10.800]  Maybe they're amazing.
[21:10.800 --> 21:11.960]  Maybe they're not.
[21:11.960 --> 21:13.440]  The only way to tell us to grow them.
[21:13.480 --> 21:15.040]  But you always have to make sure
[21:15.040 --> 21:18.360]  there are no hermaphrodite signs popping up in these plants.
[21:18.360 --> 21:20.400]  Some plants like to go seven or eight weeks
[21:20.400 --> 21:22.080]  before they even let you know,
[21:22.080 --> 21:25.000]  boink, I've got male balls on me somewhere.
[21:25.000 --> 21:26.160]  And then you're like, no, what do I do?
[21:26.160 --> 21:28.240]  I'm seven weeks in, I've been flowering this plant
[21:28.240 --> 21:30.840]  for seven weeks and it's showing me a problem.
[21:30.840 --> 21:32.320]  Do I try to pick the nanners out?
[21:32.320 --> 21:35.160]  Do I spray it with water and try to cut off that one bud?
[21:35.160 --> 21:38.480]  Do I just risk it because maybe they're non-fertile?
[21:38.480 --> 21:39.360]  What's the word for that?
[21:39.360 --> 21:41.200]  Sterile fucking flowers?
[21:41.200 --> 21:43.560]  There's so many different options for that right there.
[21:43.560 --> 21:47.400]  So just pay attention, pay really close attention.
[21:47.400 --> 21:50.400]  If you have limited access to seeds,
[21:50.400 --> 21:51.440]  just wanna have a project,
[21:51.440 --> 21:52.960]  you wanna throw some shit outdoors,
[21:52.960 --> 21:54.240]  these could be awesome.
[21:54.240 --> 21:56.400]  I just said, throw them outdoors.
[21:56.400 --> 21:58.800]  That's when you really have to keep an eye on males
[21:58.800 --> 21:59.640]  and shit like that.
[21:59.640 --> 22:01.000]  Because if you pollinate Mike's outdoor
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.080]  and my outdoor and Jesse's outdoor,
[22:03.080 --> 22:04.240]  we're gonna come looking for you
[22:04.240 --> 22:06.120]  and we're gonna cut down your crop and take yours
[22:06.120 --> 22:07.680]  because we don't have one this year.
[22:07.680 --> 22:09.080]  That's what happens in a farm community
[22:09.080 --> 22:11.000]  if you fuck up and let the males go.
[22:11.800 --> 22:12.720]  So you do have a bunch of free seeds.
[22:12.720 --> 22:14.440]  I'm sorry you didn't get any medicine out of that.
[22:14.440 --> 22:16.000]  That is disappointing.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.520]  The way to stop that is to grow your own medicine.
[22:18.520 --> 22:20.000]  Listen to all the podcasts, you'll learn how to,
[22:20.000 --> 22:20.840]  oh, they are growing.
[22:20.840 --> 22:21.680]  They said they learned how to grow
[22:21.680 --> 22:22.880]  most of their lessons from us.
[22:22.880 --> 22:24.000]  So they are growing.
[22:24.000 --> 22:24.840]  Grow these out.
[22:24.840 --> 22:27.400]  Grow them side by side by reliable stuff and compare them.
[22:27.400 --> 22:28.960]  See what you've got.
[22:28.960 --> 22:30.280]  You never know.
[22:30.280 --> 22:31.840]  You could have the next chem dog.
[22:31.840 --> 22:34.600]  Dude, you read my fucking brain, dude.
[22:34.600 --> 22:36.280]  Gorilla Glue was an accident.
[22:36.280 --> 22:38.200]  Golden Goat was an accident.
[22:38.200 --> 22:40.520]  In my assumption, Girl Scout Cookies
[22:40.520 --> 22:42.400]  was probably an accident.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.840]  Chem Dog was an accident.
[22:43.840 --> 22:47.960]  So you could have the next Gorilla Cookie Chem Scout
[22:47.960 --> 22:50.360]  something in there that is fucking amazing
[22:50.360 --> 22:51.800]  and you may get to name it.
[22:51.800 --> 22:52.920]  Like it came out of Blue Dream,
[22:52.920 --> 22:54.680]  so it's only got so much potential,
[22:54.680 --> 22:57.440]  but you may get to give it a name, I know.
[22:57.440 --> 22:59.160]  I was gonna try not to rip on Blue Dream
[22:59.160 --> 23:00.320]  and you went there anyway.
[23:00.320 --> 23:02.280]  You know, I was gentle about it and it's just a joke.
[23:02.280 --> 23:04.880]  You guys, I have been part of the, it's a joke.
[23:04.880 --> 23:05.720]  I'm gonna say it out loud.
[23:05.720 --> 23:07.040]  I've been part of the fuck Blue Dream gang
[23:07.040 --> 23:08.720]  for quite a while.
[23:08.720 --> 23:09.640]  It's just a joke.
[23:09.640 --> 23:10.920]  Blue Dream is a quality strain.
[23:10.920 --> 23:13.440]  If it works for you, let it do your thing.
[23:13.440 --> 23:16.880]  We grew, consumed, sold, smoked, traded.
[23:16.880 --> 23:17.800]  So much Blue Dream.
[23:17.800 --> 23:20.520]  So much Blue Dream that everything smelled like Blue Dream
[23:20.520 --> 23:22.640]  and it was ridiculous for a little while.
[23:22.640 --> 23:25.400]  And when you would say Blue Dream, my insides would cringe.
[23:25.400 --> 23:26.240]  It's not that bad.
[23:26.240 --> 23:27.160]  If you're trying to make some money,
[23:27.160 --> 23:28.160]  if you got a production grow,
[23:28.160 --> 23:29.320]  trying to kick it the fuck out,
[23:29.320 --> 23:31.320]  Blue Dream will pay the bills,
[23:31.320 --> 23:33.920]  but it also, it doesn't get me as stoned
[23:33.960 --> 23:36.240]  as I could try to get off of some fucking other stuff.
[23:36.240 --> 23:38.360]  So we just like to pick on Blue Dream.
[23:38.360 --> 23:39.760]  We used to call it stripper weed.
[23:39.760 --> 23:40.600]  It smells real good.
[23:40.600 --> 23:41.440]  It's real nice.
[23:41.440 --> 23:42.280]  It'll get the girls nice and lit.
[23:42.280 --> 23:43.120]  But if you're a connoisseur
[23:43.120 --> 23:44.680]  and you're really fucking dabbing up
[23:44.680 --> 23:46.160]  and smoke that Blue Dream like it's water,
[23:46.160 --> 23:48.160]  nothing will happen to you.
[23:48.160 --> 23:49.960]  But you've got a cool Blue Dream cross.
[23:49.960 --> 23:51.120]  Who knows what's in there?
[23:51.120 --> 23:51.960]  Grow it out.
[23:51.960 --> 23:52.800]  See what you got.
[23:53.640 --> 23:55.000]  Mike, do you want to jump into more emails?
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.360]  We've only been going for, I'm gonna guess, 25-ish minutes.
[23:58.360 --> 24:01.160]  I feel like we cut the people short if we don't get them.
[24:01.160 --> 24:02.000]  At least-
[24:02.000 --> 24:02.840]  We can do another email.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.160]  I've got a pile of emails here.
[24:04.160 --> 24:05.880]  I have those two prepared.
[24:05.880 --> 24:09.560]  Let's see how long I think this one might take us.
[24:09.560 --> 24:11.560]  That one's gonna be a long time.
[24:11.560 --> 24:12.720]  This one's two pages.
[24:12.720 --> 24:15.320]  I know guys, this is maybe gonna get edited,
[24:15.320 --> 24:17.520]  but we may just go right here.
[24:17.520 --> 24:20.000]  That's an email, two pages.
[24:22.400 --> 24:24.000]  Well, let's just read this one.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.960]  All right, guys, we're gonna keep the show flowing.
[24:25.960 --> 24:28.560]  I'm just gonna read the one on the top of the pile.
[24:28.560 --> 24:29.880]  Did they want their name said?
[24:29.920 --> 24:33.920]  This one comes from a dedicated and a grateful man.
[24:33.920 --> 24:35.480]  So it goes a lot like this.
[24:35.480 --> 24:36.880]  Before getting too far into this email,
[24:36.880 --> 24:39.200]  I'd like just to give you a heads up
[24:39.200 --> 24:41.440]  that my email does include my real name.
[24:41.440 --> 24:42.800]  Yeah, I'm not gonna say that.
[24:42.800 --> 24:44.040]  If you read this on the podcast,
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.640]  if you do happen to read the whole,
[24:45.640 --> 24:46.480]  sorry, I'm trying to catch,
[24:46.480 --> 24:48.400]  I know there's parts I'm not supposed to say.
[24:48.400 --> 24:49.240]  There we go.
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.080]  I'll get on with the reason I'm emailing you.
[24:52.080 --> 24:54.320]  I actually just recently discovered your podcast.
[24:54.320 --> 24:56.160]  I am eternally grateful that I am lucky enough
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.400]  to have done so, as you are by far
[24:58.400 --> 25:01.000]  the most best in the business
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.800]  when it comes to cannabis education,
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.880]  or at least you are in my opinion.
[25:04.880 --> 25:07.720]  That is a great way to start a really long email.
[25:07.720 --> 25:09.400]  Thank you, I'm glad you found us,
[25:09.400 --> 25:12.080]  and I'm glad that you find I'm the best for education.
[25:12.080 --> 25:13.280]  I don't find it a competition.
[25:13.280 --> 25:14.640]  I say that all the time,
[25:14.640 --> 25:16.160]  but even when there's no competition,
[25:16.160 --> 25:19.240]  when someone tells you you're the best, it feels damn good.
[25:19.240 --> 25:20.240]  Where else are we?
[25:20.240 --> 25:22.200]  My love and undying passion for cannabis
[25:22.200 --> 25:23.400]  started about two years ago
[25:23.400 --> 25:26.280]  when I spent some time with my father in California.
[25:26.280 --> 25:28.120]  There I smoked cannabis for the first time,
[25:28.840 --> 25:29.680]  and I truly discovered how wonderful
[25:29.680 --> 25:32.360]  and amazing this plant truly is.
[25:32.360 --> 25:35.160]  Big shout out to California and California Cannabis.
[25:35.160 --> 25:37.440]  Since I have not shared this fact with many others
[25:37.440 --> 25:39.680]  other than my closest family and friends,
[25:39.680 --> 25:41.840]  as I now live in prohibition land,
[25:41.840 --> 25:44.080]  and many, if not most of the people surrounding me
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.080]  are strictly anti-cannabis as I once was
[25:47.080 --> 25:49.040]  before I decided to make my own decisions
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.800]  to educate myself on this wonderful plant.
[25:52.800 --> 25:54.440]  Bro, welcome to the team.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.000]  This dude's walking around with like a secret.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.920]  He's like, I smoke weed and it's so fucking cool,
[25:58.720 --> 25:59.560]  and I can't tell anybody.
[25:59.560 --> 26:01.480]  Welcome to the dark side, homie.
[26:01.480 --> 26:02.320]  Yeah.
[26:02.320 --> 26:03.440]  Got snacks.
[26:03.440 --> 26:04.280]  Come on, bro.
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.560]  Come hang out with us over here in Colorado
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.840]  where we are all open about talking about cannabis.
[26:08.840 --> 26:10.600]  Goes on to say, the friends and family
[26:10.600 --> 26:12.160]  that I have chosen to confide in
[26:12.160 --> 26:13.800]  have reacted surprisingly well,
[26:13.800 --> 26:15.600]  and I'm thankful to them for that.
[26:15.600 --> 26:16.840]  They probably smoke too, bro.
[26:16.840 --> 26:19.200]  They're looking for smoke buddies.
[26:19.200 --> 26:20.600]  Even with that being said, however,
[26:20.600 --> 26:24.400]  it has been over a year and maybe two
[26:24.400 --> 26:26.080]  since I have even been around cannabis
[26:26.080 --> 26:27.840]  in any way, shape, or form,
[26:28.720 --> 26:31.400]  and I am scared now to even talk about it as is
[26:31.400 --> 26:33.440]  like so many others who choose to keep
[26:33.440 --> 26:35.160]  their love for cannabis to themselves.
[26:35.160 --> 26:37.560]  He said, I have a job and many other good things
[26:37.560 --> 26:39.360]  I would rather not have taken away from me
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.560]  just for consuming a plant.
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.720]  Here I am rambling again.
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.880]  Yes, but dude, we like it when you ramble.
[26:44.880 --> 26:45.760]  Yeah, we do.
[26:45.760 --> 26:47.360]  However, there really is a reason
[26:47.360 --> 26:49.760]  I decided to contact you, believe it or not.
[26:49.760 --> 26:51.320]  Bro, that's a good setup, so I like that.
[26:51.320 --> 26:52.240]  We know a little bit about you,
[26:52.240 --> 26:53.360]  and I feel like we're friends now.
[26:53.360 --> 26:55.480]  It says, as I stated previously,
[26:55.480 --> 26:57.160]  even though I have not been around cannabis
[26:57.200 --> 26:59.040]  for close to two years now,
[26:59.040 --> 27:01.880]  and my love and passion for it is still undeterred,
[27:01.880 --> 27:03.800]  I have decided that a major goal of mine
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.520]  would be ultimately to get a job as a consultant
[27:06.520 --> 27:08.680]  or a lead cultivator or a breeder
[27:08.680 --> 27:10.760]  or any other job that will allow me
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.200]  to be around this wonderful, magical plant.
[27:14.200 --> 27:15.840]  I have done countless hours of research
[27:15.840 --> 27:17.720]  and listened to all the grow lessons
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.320]  on the podcast all the way from 351 up to 385.
[27:21.320 --> 27:23.200]  I'm sure he's way further than that by now,
[27:23.200 --> 27:25.880]  and I intend to continue to listen to the podcast,
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.000]  old episodes and new, so I can absorb all the information.
[27:30.440 --> 27:32.880]  There's a lot more, but I think the question is,
[27:32.880 --> 27:33.800]  how can he get into it?
[27:33.800 --> 27:35.160]  He hasn't been around a plant for so long.
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.120]  It says, I may return to California to do a grow of my own.
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.000]  I know there's no substitute for experience from research,
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.480]  but it seems like the number one thing
[27:42.480 --> 27:45.400]  a company wants is experience, absolutely.
[27:45.400 --> 27:47.360]  It says, I would like to take a horticultural course
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.520]  from Oakster Dam, because I know that if nothing else,
[27:50.520 --> 27:51.640]  it will look good on a resume.
[27:51.640 --> 27:54.080]  I don't expect to enter the industry as a lead consultant
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.400]  or a lead cultivator, but I hope to get able
[27:56.400 --> 27:57.720]  to get there with time.
[27:57.720 --> 28:00.560]  The most important thing I wanted to ask, here we go, is,
[28:00.560 --> 28:02.760]  do you have any tips to get into legal cannabis,
[28:02.760 --> 28:04.600]  other than just putting out a resume
[28:04.600 --> 28:06.160]  and hoping for someone to hire you?
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.980]  Any and all tips would be greatly appreciated.
[28:08.980 --> 28:11.720]  Hopefully, where are we?
[28:11.720 --> 28:13.200]  Is it impossible to get hired in the industry
[28:13.200 --> 28:14.320]  without hands-on growing?
[28:14.320 --> 28:16.400]  Hopefully this case won't be for me,
[28:16.400 --> 28:17.720]  just in case worse comes to worse
[28:17.720 --> 28:19.800]  for anyone else wondering the same thing.
[28:19.800 --> 28:20.880]  I know you're busy, yeah,
[28:20.880 --> 28:22.160]  but I got your email on the show, bro,
[28:22.160 --> 28:23.920]  so thank you for the great email.
[28:23.920 --> 28:26.240]  Okay, I will continue listening to the podcast,
[28:26.240 --> 28:28.240]  and I have, as I have done for years,
[28:28.240 --> 28:30.040]  also make sure to get a little medicated
[28:30.040 --> 28:31.840]  for all of us out here in Prohibition Land.
[28:31.840 --> 28:34.240]  Sincerely, a dedicated and grateful man.
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.680]  I'm sorry I stumbled through that one.
[28:35.680 --> 28:37.200]  It's in really small font.
[28:37.200 --> 28:39.000]  I don't know why the fucking font came out that little,
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  but I felt like an old man reading that shit.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.680]  So our friend here has a passion for cannabis.
[28:43.680 --> 28:45.120]  Unfortunately, where they are,
[28:45.120 --> 28:47.860]  they cannot get any hands-on experience with cannabis,
[28:47.860 --> 28:52.000]  but they would like to enter the legal cannabis industry.
[28:52.840 --> 28:55.640]  And they wanna know if we've got any advice for them.
[28:56.880 --> 28:58.640]  There are a lot of ways to go about this.
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.400]  First of all, as someone that hires growers and helpers
[29:02.400 --> 29:04.800]  and people in a cultivation facility,
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.080]  I kinda like people who don't have bad habits.
[29:08.080 --> 29:08.920]  This is like getting-
[29:08.920 --> 29:10.160]  It's easier to train people right
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.400]  than it is to break bad habits.
[29:11.400 --> 29:12.240]  Exactly.
[29:12.240 --> 29:13.080]  And then train them, right?
[29:13.080 --> 29:14.800]  So that is sort of an advantage.
[29:14.800 --> 29:17.360]  It's also, there are guys out there that show up,
[29:17.360 --> 29:18.560]  and they're like, I've been growing for this long,
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.400]  I know how to do this,
[29:19.400 --> 29:21.280]  I can identify fucking pest problems,
[29:21.280 --> 29:23.200]  I can identify fucking nutrient problems,
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.520]  I can see things, I know how to work on things.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.360]  Those guys are great,
[29:26.360 --> 29:29.120]  but also they got some ego problems,
[29:29.120 --> 29:30.840]  and they're too trained and programmed.
[29:30.840 --> 29:33.920]  They wanna come into my grow and do it their way.
[29:33.920 --> 29:35.720]  And I don't wanna do it their way
[29:35.720 --> 29:39.000]  because a home grow is way different than a commercial grow.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.440]  And cool, your home grow works, keep killing it, slugger,
[29:41.440 --> 29:43.320]  but we've got millions of dollars here,
[29:43.320 --> 29:45.160]  and we've gotta make this shit work every day,
[29:45.160 --> 29:47.320]  repeatedly, on schedules, on cycles.
[29:47.320 --> 29:49.280]  So somebody like yourself
[29:49.280 --> 29:51.080]  that doesn't have a lot of experience,
[29:51.760 --> 29:52.600]  who doesn't have bad habits,
[29:52.600 --> 29:53.640]  who isn't trained to fuck shit up,
[29:53.640 --> 29:55.520]  that I can teach fresh from the start,
[29:55.520 --> 29:56.800]  is very valuable to me.
[29:56.800 --> 29:59.160]  So you do have an opportunity there.
[29:59.160 --> 30:02.800]  And if the passion that you convey in this email
[30:02.800 --> 30:05.360]  comes through in the interview,
[30:05.360 --> 30:08.040]  the enthusiasm, the passion, the eagerness to learn,
[30:08.040 --> 30:10.040]  the willingness to learn and adjust,
[30:10.040 --> 30:11.200]  that helps you out in an interview.
[30:11.200 --> 30:14.160]  That makes me wanna put you on the Grow Tech team
[30:14.160 --> 30:15.840]  and see what you can do.
[30:15.840 --> 30:18.760]  So there are a couple things I wrote down.
[30:18.800 --> 30:21.360]  Unfortunately, you say you wanna be lead cultivator,
[30:21.360 --> 30:24.800]  lead somebody, Mike shaking his head no.
[30:24.800 --> 30:28.200]  In the cannabis industry, everybody has to start off as-
[30:28.200 --> 30:29.440]  Start in the mail room, yo.
[30:29.440 --> 30:30.960]  Yeah, you gotta start on the bottom somewhere.
[30:30.960 --> 30:33.320]  There's already a lead cultivator.
[30:33.320 --> 30:35.800]  Usually if the lead cultivator quits or gets fired,
[30:35.800 --> 30:38.200]  the lead grower becomes lead cultivator,
[30:38.200 --> 30:40.200]  and then everybody just shifts up one step.
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.520]  And the only way to get in that line
[30:41.520 --> 30:43.200]  is to start at the bottom.
[30:43.200 --> 30:44.480]  You're either a trimmer,
[30:44.480 --> 30:47.320]  or you're either a Grow Tech or a bud tender.
[30:47.320 --> 30:49.840]  Those are the main three places you enter into the Grow.
[30:49.840 --> 30:51.800]  You're lucky to enter as a Grow Tech.
[30:51.800 --> 30:53.960]  I like to find my Grow Techs from the trim room.
[30:53.960 --> 30:56.120]  When there are tasks that need to be done,
[30:56.120 --> 30:56.960]  when I need a hand,
[30:56.960 --> 30:59.600]  if I need somebody to do something random,
[30:59.600 --> 31:01.000]  and you show that you can do it,
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.560]  you can take objective, you can learn it,
[31:02.560 --> 31:04.040]  you can manage it, you can get it done
[31:04.040 --> 31:05.280]  and get back to your normal job,
[31:05.280 --> 31:06.960]  and it doesn't fuck up the flow.
[31:06.960 --> 31:09.040]  When I need two or three things done in the Grow,
[31:09.040 --> 31:09.880]  I think about you.
[31:09.880 --> 31:11.360]  And then one day when Mike can't do it
[31:11.360 --> 31:13.040]  because he gotta do something with a kid,
[31:13.040 --> 31:15.120]  I go, hey, what's our friend's name?
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.960]  Dedicated, do you wanna work in the Grow today?
[31:17.600 --> 31:18.440]  Because Mike is sick
[31:18.440 --> 31:19.840]  or Mike's off taking care of the family.
[31:19.840 --> 31:22.320]  And you're like, holy shit, I get to be a Grow guy today.
[31:22.320 --> 31:24.120]  And then one day somebody will quit
[31:24.120 --> 31:25.240]  or somebody will not show up.
[31:25.240 --> 31:26.080]  And guess what?
[31:26.080 --> 31:28.200]  I say dedicated, you've been dedicated for a while.
[31:28.200 --> 31:29.040]  Guess what, bro?
[31:29.040 --> 31:29.860]  Now you're the Grow Tech.
[31:29.860 --> 31:31.840]  And you go, oh, I'm working here now.
[31:31.840 --> 31:35.240]  Yeah, and then one day I'll get tired of the bullshit
[31:35.240 --> 31:36.640]  from the manager at that facility
[31:36.640 --> 31:37.880]  or the owner of that facility
[31:37.880 --> 31:39.140]  or the consultant at that facility
[31:39.140 --> 31:41.840]  or another facility will offer me better money
[31:41.840 --> 31:43.920]  and less hours and I'll take it.
[31:43.920 --> 31:44.920]  And I just won't show up.
[31:44.920 --> 31:46.160]  No, that's not how I really do it.
[31:46.160 --> 31:47.920]  But I'm just saying, I'll fucking move on
[31:47.920 --> 31:48.760]  because that's what I do.
[31:48.760 --> 31:49.900]  I move on from facilities.
[31:49.900 --> 31:51.560]  I get them rolling, I get the staff trained up,
[31:51.560 --> 31:53.040]  I get a good solid flow.
[31:53.040 --> 31:54.840]  And then once the music is rolling on itself,
[31:54.840 --> 31:56.080]  they don't need a conductor,
[31:56.080 --> 31:57.680]  I take off and let the band play on its own
[31:57.680 --> 31:58.800]  and I go somewhere else.
[31:58.800 --> 32:02.000]  At that point, one of those growers takes the reins.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.340]  And so you move up, they move up, we all shift up forward.
[32:05.340 --> 32:07.640]  If you show that you've got initiative
[32:07.640 --> 32:09.080]  and you can follow instructions
[32:09.080 --> 32:11.880]  and it's basically following instructions a lot of the time.
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.200]  Being able to do extreme repetition correctly.
[32:18.840 --> 32:22.920]  It ain't no thing to have three plants to de-fan those.
[32:23.880 --> 32:27.440]  3,000 plants is a different story altogether.
[32:27.440 --> 32:30.380]  It requires a different process, a different game plan,
[32:30.380 --> 32:32.520]  different techniques, different attitude,
[32:32.520 --> 32:34.480]  different attack plan.
[32:34.480 --> 32:39.200]  And being able to just sit at a table and trim
[32:39.200 --> 32:43.960]  five days a week, eight hours a day for six months
[32:43.960 --> 32:47.520]  before somebody says, hey, instead of trimming nugs,
[32:47.520 --> 32:50.440]  now you get to pull fan leaves for five days a week,
[32:50.440 --> 32:53.120]  eight hours a day for the next six months.
[32:53.120 --> 32:54.000]  And that's a real job.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.240]  There are somebody that gets paid to defoliate
[32:56.240 --> 32:57.320]  five days a week.
[32:57.320 --> 32:59.640]  They fill five gallon buckets up with leaves,
[32:59.640 --> 33:01.520]  put them on a scale where you have to weigh the leaves
[33:01.520 --> 33:03.240]  that are torn off, they throw them away.
[33:03.240 --> 33:05.280]  That's the whole job all day long.
[33:05.280 --> 33:09.240]  So all you do is just slowly walk rows, pulling fan leaves.
[33:09.240 --> 33:11.800]  Somebody else is slowly walking rows,
[33:11.800 --> 33:13.720]  twisting stuff into trellis netting.
[33:13.720 --> 33:16.860]  And somebody else is slowly walking rows,
[33:16.860 --> 33:19.880]  checking piping emitters.
[33:19.880 --> 33:22.320]  Another person is more quickly walking around
[33:22.320 --> 33:23.720]  distributing predator bugs.
[33:23.720 --> 33:26.200]  If they're sachets or sprinkling them into pots,
[33:26.200 --> 33:28.120]  that all that should actually get done.
[33:28.120 --> 33:30.320]  Oh God, don't talk about metric tags.
[33:30.320 --> 33:31.580]  Mike, you're giving me small nightmares.
[33:31.580 --> 33:34.140]  The metric tags stabbed me low.
[33:34.140 --> 33:35.940]  So there's all small stuff that needs to be done.
[33:35.940 --> 33:38.180]  And we find entry level folks to do that.
[33:38.180 --> 33:40.180]  And if you can do it correctly, that's when we move you up.
[33:40.180 --> 33:41.020]  That's kind of what I think.
[33:41.020 --> 33:42.740]  That's where you're gonna start.
[33:42.740 --> 33:44.400]  Same thing at the retail.
[33:44.400 --> 33:47.380]  Everybody starts off as a bud tender or a greeter.
[33:47.380 --> 33:48.220]  Yeah.
[33:48.220 --> 33:52.020]  And after a while, hey, someone so quick,
[33:52.020 --> 33:55.180]  you wanna step up and be a manager.
[33:55.180 --> 33:56.940]  All right, somebody stepped up.
[33:56.940 --> 33:59.220]  We need somebody to do our marketing,
[33:59.220 --> 34:00.660]  advertising, whatever else.
[34:00.660 --> 34:01.820]  And to be management,
[34:01.820 --> 34:03.860]  not only do you need to be able to manage plants,
[34:04.580 --> 34:05.420]  but plants are the easy part
[34:05.420 --> 34:07.260]  when it comes to managing commercial cultivation.
[34:07.260 --> 34:10.460]  I've got to manage Mike and I've got to manage John
[34:10.460 --> 34:13.140]  and I got to manage Brian and Elijah.
[34:13.140 --> 34:15.660]  And I should put some girl names in there, Sarah.
[34:15.660 --> 34:17.380]  And just because we do have females in there,
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.640]  I was just trying not to pick on them,
[34:18.640 --> 34:20.680]  but I got to manage people.
[34:20.680 --> 34:23.580]  And all of those people have different personalities,
[34:23.580 --> 34:25.100]  different lifestyles.
[34:25.100 --> 34:29.100]  I can't address Mike and Elijah in the same tone of voice
[34:29.100 --> 34:30.220]  because they're different people.
[34:30.220 --> 34:32.500]  I have to learn how to get them to do what I need done
[34:32.500 --> 34:35.060]  politely and still sternly as a boss
[34:35.060 --> 34:38.180]  without pissing them off and disrupting their personal
[34:38.180 --> 34:39.220]  just because how people are.
[34:39.220 --> 34:40.060]  If you tell some people,
[34:40.060 --> 34:42.340]  hey, bro, fucking go do that real quick, they get upset.
[34:42.340 --> 34:43.540]  But if I tell Mike, hey, bro,
[34:43.540 --> 34:45.660]  go fucking shut off that water before it overflows.
[34:45.660 --> 34:48.380]  I said, fucking and bro, Mike's okay with that.
[34:48.380 --> 34:50.460]  If I say, Sarah, go fucking turn off the water.
[34:50.460 --> 34:51.940]  It sounds like I'm yelling at Sarah.
[34:51.940 --> 34:52.860]  So I have to say, hey, Sarah,
[34:52.860 --> 34:55.060]  will you please get the water before it overflows?
[34:55.060 --> 34:57.240]  Yeah, being management is a whole new game.
[34:57.240 --> 34:59.580]  You have to think about every word and shit like that.
[34:59.580 --> 35:00.980]  So you got to manage people.
[35:00.980 --> 35:03.100]  Then you have to manage schedules.
[35:03.100 --> 35:05.220]  Like how many days do I need Mike here?
[35:05.220 --> 35:06.620]  How many hours can Mike work?
[35:06.620 --> 35:07.660]  Like there are so many things.
[35:07.660 --> 35:10.060]  So that's a whole nother skill in itself.
[35:10.060 --> 35:11.260]  You have to have some people
[35:11.260 --> 35:13.780]  and some team managing experience,
[35:13.780 --> 35:15.580]  which takes years to develop.
[35:15.580 --> 35:17.880]  And that I'm still not really good at it,
[35:17.880 --> 35:20.260]  but I think I've got a decent hand on managing a staff
[35:20.260 --> 35:21.760]  and getting a team to do what I need done
[35:21.760 --> 35:22.780]  and accomplishing a grow.
[35:22.780 --> 35:25.260]  But that takes a lot of time to develop.
[35:26.380 --> 35:27.980]  One of the things I really caught out here is this,
[35:27.980 --> 35:28.820]  how do I apply?
[35:28.820 --> 35:30.040]  How do I get noticed?
[35:31.100 --> 35:32.980]  Same way with any other job,
[35:32.980 --> 35:36.380]  you put together a resume and you go around and apply.
[35:36.380 --> 35:38.820]  Mike cannot see the paper on my desk.
[35:38.820 --> 35:39.820]  Yeah, being out of state,
[35:39.820 --> 35:41.700]  you're kind of at a disadvantage.
[35:41.700 --> 35:43.540]  Mike said what my paper says.
[35:43.540 --> 35:45.340]  Cannabis is now a regulated industry.
[35:45.340 --> 35:47.020]  This is just like applying at,
[35:47.020 --> 35:49.500]  if you wanted to apply to work at a Ford dealership,
[35:49.500 --> 35:51.020]  you would email that Ford dealership
[35:51.020 --> 35:53.020]  and set up the proper contact.
[35:53.020 --> 35:55.060]  If you wanted to work at the grocery store over there,
[35:55.060 --> 35:58.980]  you would contact the dispensaries, the grows.
[35:58.980 --> 36:00.300]  It's much harder where you are
[36:00.340 --> 36:02.500]  because you don't know where the dispensaries and grows are
[36:02.500 --> 36:04.380]  but you've got a phone book or weed maps
[36:04.380 --> 36:07.300]  or whatever works for you to contact places.
[36:07.300 --> 36:10.100]  There are groups on social media where you can join
[36:10.100 --> 36:12.160]  that will actually help you find jobs
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.940]  in other locations in the cannabis industry.
[36:14.940 --> 36:16.660]  I'm sure there are groups online where you are
[36:16.660 --> 36:17.860]  that will help you do that.
[36:17.860 --> 36:19.660]  Unfortunately, I didn't research.
[36:19.660 --> 36:22.440]  The group that makes me think about jobs
[36:22.440 --> 36:27.220]  and finding on Facebook is the Colorado Badged Network 2.0.
[36:27.220 --> 36:29.920]  You have to send in a request to be in the group
[36:30.540 --> 36:31.380]  but then they will help you find a job
[36:31.380 --> 36:33.640]  in the Colorado cannabis industry.
[36:33.640 --> 36:36.880]  I'm sure there's one for pretty much every legal state now.
[36:36.880 --> 36:39.520]  Yeah, then another thing, if you're coming to Colorado
[36:39.520 --> 36:40.880]  or if you're going to another state
[36:40.880 --> 36:43.200]  that is ran by the Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[36:43.200 --> 36:45.520]  you need to ensure that you can acquire
[36:45.520 --> 36:48.000]  a Marijuana Enforcement Division badge
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.160]  where you can even apply to work in the industry.
[36:50.160 --> 36:51.940]  Without that, you can't get in at all.
[36:51.940 --> 36:53.040]  You can't walk into a grow.
[36:53.040 --> 36:55.600]  You can't walk into, as a worker,
[36:55.600 --> 36:57.800]  you can't walk into a dispensary.
[36:57.800 --> 37:00.080]  You can't touch any product without that badge.
[37:00.080 --> 37:03.880]  So if you've got crimes or weird shit on your record,
[37:03.880 --> 37:05.640]  you may not be qualified to research
[37:05.640 --> 37:07.040]  and see if you're allowed to do that
[37:07.040 --> 37:08.680]  before you move to somewhere.
[37:08.680 --> 37:09.840]  Find out where you wanna go.
[37:09.840 --> 37:11.320]  See where you'd like to go.
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.840]  Locate some businesses in that area and contact them.
[37:14.840 --> 37:17.400]  See if you can do a phone or a Skype or a Zoom interview.
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.000]  Let them know how eager you are to work
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.660]  and then if it's time to relocate, come on down.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.360]  And when you do the-
[37:24.360 --> 37:27.720]  You've got, I mean, two big options.
[37:27.720 --> 37:30.640]  If you're gonna move, take the time to pick a place
[37:30.640 --> 37:32.360]  where you're gonna be happy
[37:32.360 --> 37:33.800]  and you're gonna be allowed to work
[37:33.800 --> 37:36.560]  because there are a bunch of people that came to Colorado
[37:36.560 --> 37:38.400]  that have felonies on their record
[37:38.400 --> 37:39.960]  and that's like rule one here.
[37:41.960 --> 37:44.400]  Now, in other states, they're making a point
[37:44.400 --> 37:46.760]  to not exclude felons because the people
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.240]  who were disenfranchised by prohibition laws
[37:50.240 --> 37:52.340]  should have a crack at the legal industry.
[37:53.180 --> 37:55.300]  In Colorado, we said, absolutely not.
[37:55.300 --> 37:57.300]  If you got busted for weed two years ago,
[37:57.300 --> 37:58.700]  10 years ago, don't matter.
[37:59.980 --> 38:00.820]  Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[38:00.820 --> 38:04.000]  A lot of good growers were banned already.
[38:04.860 --> 38:06.580]  And a lot of people that moved here
[38:06.580 --> 38:09.940]  to work in the industry had no idea.
[38:09.940 --> 38:11.620]  And so they moved across the country.
[38:11.620 --> 38:13.340]  They packed up their family.
[38:13.340 --> 38:15.020]  They didn't have enough resources
[38:15.020 --> 38:18.080]  to make that move again once they got here
[38:18.080 --> 38:20.980]  and they ended up working some regular job
[38:20.980 --> 38:24.140]  that they could have had back home, but in Colorado.
[38:25.420 --> 38:27.800]  But yeah, take the time to research it
[38:27.800 --> 38:29.900]  or fight and get a legal where you're at
[38:29.900 --> 38:31.300]  and then you don't gotta move.
[38:31.300 --> 38:32.140]  That's the truth.
[38:32.140 --> 38:33.420]  And you can get it on the ground floor
[38:33.420 --> 38:37.060]  where you might not have to work your way up so hard.
[38:37.060 --> 38:39.620]  You can start in the middle off if it's your own place.
[38:39.620 --> 38:42.180]  Mike, it's like you've got my notes in front of you.
[38:42.180 --> 38:43.020]  Yep.
[38:43.020 --> 38:44.380]  I was gonna segue into that by saying,
[38:44.380 --> 38:45.920]  when you do get the interview,
[38:45.920 --> 38:48.840]  don't treat it like it's a stoner job.
[38:49.840 --> 38:51.880]  We need people that are dressed semi-decently.
[38:51.880 --> 38:53.180]  I mean, don't show up in a suit and shit,
[38:53.180 --> 38:54.920]  but don't show up like a bum.
[38:54.920 --> 38:56.640]  You're gonna be around a lot of other people.
[38:56.640 --> 38:57.480]  We need hygiene.
[38:57.480 --> 38:58.520]  We need professionalism.
[38:58.520 --> 38:59.480]  Be on time.
[38:59.480 --> 39:00.800]  Treat it like any other job.
[39:00.800 --> 39:05.040]  Have a good resume, dress, speak, and write professionally.
[39:05.040 --> 39:06.720]  Don't show up with a bunch of homies in the car.
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.520]  Don't bring weed to the interview.
[39:08.520 --> 39:09.880]  Don't be baked when you show up.
[39:09.880 --> 39:11.160]  I've seen it all.
[39:11.160 --> 39:15.640]  I've literally seen all of those within the last year or two.
[39:15.640 --> 39:16.480]  Yeah.
[39:17.440 --> 39:20.040]  People get weird when they hear it's a cannabis job,
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.120]  but the important part of that is job, not cannabis.
[39:23.120 --> 39:23.960]  Yeah.
[39:23.960 --> 39:26.140]  We had somebody show up stoned as shit,
[39:26.140 --> 39:28.320]  smoke coming out of their clothing still,
[39:28.320 --> 39:30.220]  and they had a group of six people in their car
[39:30.220 --> 39:32.360]  waiting for them, and the music was going,
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.000]  gung, gung, gung, gung, gung,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.080]  through the whole building
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.480]  while I was trying to interview this person.
[39:37.480 --> 39:38.680]  I couldn't hear their interview
[39:38.680 --> 39:41.600]  over their own friend's fucking stupid music.
[39:41.600 --> 39:44.480]  That person did not get, I didn't complete the interview.
[39:44.480 --> 39:46.140]  I made it look like the interview was done,
[39:46.800 --> 39:47.640]  and then I said, well, thank you.
[39:47.640 --> 39:50.300]  We'll let you know, and I threw their application.
[39:51.300 --> 39:53.160]  If we pick you, you'll hear from us.
[39:54.700 --> 39:55.660]  We'll call you.
[39:56.980 --> 39:58.440]  Yeah.
[39:58.440 --> 39:59.380]  It'll work there.
[39:59.380 --> 40:00.540]  Not gonna call you.
[40:00.540 --> 40:01.380]  Nope.
[40:02.300 --> 40:04.180]  I feel like we covered most of this part.
[40:04.180 --> 40:06.260]  You're gonna have to start at the bottom,
[40:06.260 --> 40:07.580]  and you're gonna have to find out
[40:07.580 --> 40:09.020]  if you can apply somewhere
[40:09.020 --> 40:10.240]  and see if you're qualified to work
[40:10.240 --> 40:11.420]  in whichever state you choose to,
[40:11.420 --> 40:13.060]  and then pick a good location,
[40:13.060 --> 40:14.540]  and then try to get in there.
[40:14.540 --> 40:16.660]  Or like Mike said, do what you can
[40:16.660 --> 40:19.100]  to get legalization happening in your area.
[40:19.100 --> 40:20.560]  It sounds like you're passionate,
[40:20.560 --> 40:23.560]  so maybe it may be easier to find the right people,
[40:23.560 --> 40:25.860]  team up with the local normal organization,
[40:25.860 --> 40:27.180]  and get you legal there,
[40:27.180 --> 40:28.940]  and that way you can create the rules,
[40:28.940 --> 40:30.580]  and then you can be a pioneer,
[40:30.580 --> 40:31.740]  and you can start your own grow.
[40:31.740 --> 40:34.140]  You can be one of the first to have a grow
[40:34.140 --> 40:36.360]  in your area in Prohibition land.
[40:38.340 --> 40:40.420]  Being first is nice.
[40:40.420 --> 40:41.660]  There are not a lot of places
[40:41.660 --> 40:43.980]  where you can still be first at things.
[40:44.340 --> 40:46.580]  America's getting populated quite quickly,
[40:46.580 --> 40:48.860]  so if you've got the opportunity,
[40:48.860 --> 40:50.980]  you've got the opportunity somewhere to be a pioneer,
[40:50.980 --> 40:52.900]  you pioneer that shit.
[40:52.900 --> 40:56.580]  All right, dedicated and grateful man or fan,
[40:56.580 --> 40:58.660]  I wanna thank you for the great long email.
[40:58.660 --> 40:59.820]  Bro, you ramble just like us.
[40:59.820 --> 41:00.820]  You could be part of the crew,
[41:00.820 --> 41:03.260]  come hang out sometime, take some dabs,
[41:03.260 --> 41:06.100]  come out of the shadows out there in Prohibition land.
[41:06.100 --> 41:07.020]  Thank you for the great message.
[41:07.020 --> 41:09.700]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis cultivation,
[41:09.700 --> 41:10.860]  cannabis culture question,
[41:10.860 --> 41:11.860]  we would love to hear from you.
[41:11.860 --> 41:16.180]  My email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[41:16.180 --> 41:17.740]  Don't be shy, send me an email.
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.700]  I do have a mountain of emails here,
[41:19.700 --> 41:23.300]  but I will get your email on the show eventually.
[41:23.300 --> 41:24.980]  Yeah, look forward to it.
[41:24.980 --> 41:26.780]  All right, Mike, I think this is a good point
[41:26.780 --> 41:29.860]  to start wrapping up episode 534
[41:29.860 --> 41:31.500]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[41:31.500 --> 41:32.820]  Let's wrap it up, homie.
[41:32.820 --> 41:33.860]  Let's wrap it up.
[41:34.780 --> 41:36.180]  What'd you learn today, bro?
[41:36.300 --> 41:37.140]  I should have prepared you for that.
[41:37.140 --> 41:37.980]  That was good.
[41:37.980 --> 41:40.420]  Made it through another day of the pandemic, brother.
[41:40.420 --> 41:41.260]  Yeah, we did.
[41:41.260 --> 41:42.100]  That's all.
[41:42.100 --> 41:43.100]  Yes, we did.
[41:43.100 --> 41:44.820]  Pandy, day 5,000.
[41:44.820 --> 41:46.900]  I learned that, I did learn something today.
[41:46.900 --> 41:48.340]  The fancier the sheets are,
[41:48.340 --> 41:50.860]  the faster you gotta get them out of the dryer.
[41:50.860 --> 41:52.380]  That's what I learned today.
[41:52.380 --> 41:53.220]  All right.
[41:53.220 --> 41:54.780]  The more you know, people.
[41:54.780 --> 41:55.620]  The more you know.
[41:55.620 --> 41:57.860]  Hey, bro, there's red lasers, there's blue lasers,
[41:57.860 --> 42:00.500]  and there's knowing, and knowing is half the battle.
[42:00.500 --> 42:01.340]  That's the battle, damn.
[42:01.340 --> 42:02.980]  All right, I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up.
[42:02.980 --> 42:03.820]  I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up.
[42:03.940 --> 42:05.940]  Knowing is half the battle.
[42:05.940 --> 42:07.780]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[42:07.780 --> 42:08.980]  pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[42:08.980 --> 42:10.940]  smokers and growers, clone cutters,
[42:10.940 --> 42:13.900]  seed collectors, pollen chuckers.
[42:13.900 --> 42:15.060]  I don't know what rhymes with that.
[42:15.060 --> 42:16.100]  I lost my rhythm.
[42:16.100 --> 42:17.620]  Hi, everybody out there and White Mike.
[42:17.620 --> 42:19.220]  I wanna thank you guys all for hanging out

[43:41.460 --> 43:43.780]  I try to avoid comments when people get trolly,
[43:43.780 --> 43:45.460]  but we've got a pretty good audience, dude.
[43:45.460 --> 43:46.300]  They're pretty complimentary.
[43:46.300 --> 43:47.580]  The comments have been wonderful lately.
[43:47.580 --> 43:49.220]  Wonderful comments lately.
[43:49.220 --> 43:51.420]  Mike's voice has a beard.
[43:51.420 --> 43:52.300]  That's brilliant.
[43:52.300 --> 43:54.740]  If you read the comments, you know what that means.
[43:54.740 --> 43:55.740]  Dude, thanks again for hanging out.
[43:55.740 --> 43:56.580]  This was a good time.
[43:56.580 --> 43:58.260]  We're gonna have to do this again soon.
[43:59.140 --> 44:02.620]  I think that is all I have got for this episode.
[44:02.620 --> 44:03.980]  Any last words, Mike?
[44:03.980 --> 44:05.540]  You got a Mike's moment for us?
[44:07.500 --> 44:08.420]  Quick little rant.
[44:08.420 --> 44:13.420]  If you're a dispensary owner or manager or even a trimmer,
[44:14.180 --> 44:15.420]  make sure you're trimming your herb.
[44:15.420 --> 44:17.420]  I've gotten a lot of furry nuggets lately
[44:17.420 --> 44:19.180]  during the pandemic.
[44:19.180 --> 44:21.860]  And I know dispensaries are getting off a little light
[44:21.860 --> 44:23.900]  because people can't get up on the product
[44:23.900 --> 44:27.100]  and super judge it before we buy it right now.
[44:27.100 --> 44:29.780]  But that's no reason to be slacking.
[44:29.780 --> 44:32.340]  Keep your fucking sugar leaf where it belongs,
[44:32.340 --> 44:34.020]  in the trim pile.
[44:35.340 --> 44:38.060]  That's the white Mike rant for today.
[44:38.060 --> 44:38.940]  You heard it here, guys.
[44:38.940 --> 44:40.660]  If you're in the trim room trimming right now
[44:40.660 --> 44:43.100]  and you work in a dispensary, trim that shit.
[44:43.100 --> 44:45.020]  If you're one of the people trimming it, high five fist bump.
[44:45.020 --> 44:48.100]  But if you know that that shit is a little leafy, bro,
[44:48.100 --> 44:49.700]  come on.
[44:49.700 --> 44:50.740]  Give it another pass.
[44:50.740 --> 44:53.460]  Come on, yeah, just one more spin.
[44:53.460 --> 44:55.620]  Just go back over it one more time.
[44:55.660 --> 44:57.580]  Put it on the top shelf.
[44:57.580 --> 45:01.180]  Two eights recently that would not have left the building
[45:01.180 --> 45:03.660]  if I was running quality control.
[45:03.660 --> 45:05.940]  They would have been sent back.
[45:05.940 --> 45:07.460]  One of them, I would have taken back
[45:07.460 --> 45:10.060]  and been a dick about it at the trim table.
[45:10.060 --> 45:12.900]  I would have dumped that shit out in front of the whole crew
[45:12.900 --> 45:14.260]  and just shook it out in front of you
[45:14.260 --> 45:16.420]  and been like, what the fuck?
[45:16.420 --> 45:17.900]  It was bad.
[45:17.900 --> 45:19.220]  I needed to rant.
[45:19.220 --> 45:21.300]  Thanks for listening, y'all.
[45:21.300 --> 45:22.700]  And that was Mike's moment.
[45:22.700 --> 45:24.460]  You guys, thanks for listening to two guys coughing.
[45:24.460 --> 45:25.580]  This was a good time.
[45:25.580 --> 45:28.180]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[45:28.180 --> 45:31.300]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Totally White Tops.
[45:31.300 --> 45:33.380]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[45:33.380 --> 45:34.580]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.920]  Whatsoever I feel has come to light
[46:21.920 --> 46:28.880]  And whatsoever I fought, all became my life
[46:28.880 --> 46:36.880]  Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
[46:36.880 --> 46:39.600]  Sun's about to fade in
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.080]  And I'm doing the right thing
[46:44.080 --> 46:51.080]  Whomsoever I've killed, I've sickened now
[46:51.080 --> 46:59.080]  And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
[46:59.080 --> 47:06.080]  It sucks, that's all they say, but I can't see it in the night
[47:06.080 --> 47:12.080]  I'm only faking when I get it right
[47:12.080 --> 47:17.080]  When I get it right
[47:22.080 --> 47:29.080]  And for long black days
[47:29.080 --> 47:36.080]  I've been on black days
[47:37.080 --> 47:43.080]  How would I know that this could be my fate?
[47:44.080 --> 47:52.080]  How would I know that this could be my fate?
[47:54.080 --> 48:25.070]  Dude, what you wanted to see, girl, is me here blind
[48:25.070 --> 48:32.070]  And what you wanted to be yours, is made it mine
[48:33.070 --> 48:39.070]  So don't you lock up something that you wanted to see
[48:39.070 --> 48:46.070]  Fly hands, I've been shaking, no not tied
[48:46.070 --> 48:50.070]  No not tied
[48:51.070 --> 48:54.070]  I said I don't mind the change
[49:02.880 --> 49:06.880]  I said I don't mind, I said I don't mind the change
[49:06.880 --> 49:13.920]  I said I don't mind the change
[49:13.920 --> 49:20.920]  And for long black days
[49:20.920 --> 49:27.920]  I've been on black days
[49:27.920 --> 49:33.920]  How would I know that this could be my fate?
[49:34.920 --> 49:41.920]  How would I know that this could be my fate?
[49:41.920 --> 50:08.840]  Shouldn't have made me change
