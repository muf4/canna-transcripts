[00:00.000 --> 00:06.800]  Alright, here we go.
[00:06.800 --> 00:08.240]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:08.240 --> 00:14.520]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rostichev, and this is episode 647 of the Grow From Your
[00:14.520 --> 00:15.520]  Heart Podcast.
[00:15.520 --> 00:18.760]  I'm sure you can tell already that I have sort of lost my voice.
[00:18.760 --> 00:23.000]  That's right, I woke up a few mornings ago, I did not have any voice at all.
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.920]  I've been drinking a lot of teas, I've been taking a lot of vitamins, trying to get the
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.280]  voice back in shape.
[00:27.280 --> 00:31.000]  I feel like it's coming back, but it is still not up to podcast standards.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.240]  I do apologize.
[00:32.240 --> 00:37.240]  I don't feel sick, I don't look sick, but for some reason, my voice is not cooperating.
[00:37.240 --> 00:41.120]  I don't want to make you listen to a long podcast episode where I sound terrible, so
[00:41.120 --> 00:44.200]  I'm going to drop in a clip that I have previously recorded.
[00:44.200 --> 00:48.320]  I think you will find this clip entertaining, I hope you find this clip educational, and
[00:48.320 --> 00:51.400]  I do thank you for putting up with a short podcast episode.
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.760]  I should be back Monday with the normally scheduled program, but until then, please
[00:55.760 --> 00:58.960]  enjoy this short episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.440]  All right, what's up podcast world?
[01:01.440 --> 01:02.440]  It's Rasta Jeff.
[01:02.440 --> 01:05.720]  I don't know what episode number this is going to be, but I do have an update for you.
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.480]  Today we're going to talk about male and female plants.
[01:08.480 --> 01:11.920]  I did an episode previously on sexing our cannabis plants.
[01:11.920 --> 01:15.480]  I talked about how to sex them, how to make them show you male or female, but you know
[01:15.480 --> 01:16.480]  what I never did?
[01:16.480 --> 01:20.640]  I never showed you what a male or a female cannabis plant looked like, and we didn't
[01:20.640 --> 01:23.880]  talk too much about the anatomy or functions of male or female plants.
[01:23.880 --> 01:25.640]  I do not have any notes in front of me.
[01:25.720 --> 01:29.800]  So we're going to do a spontaneous random off the top of my head ramble about male and
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.800]  female plants.
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.000]  The first thing we should do is talk about male and female plants function in the cannabis
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.240]  environment in the world.
[01:37.240 --> 01:38.440]  So what do female plants do?
[01:38.440 --> 01:40.280]  The female plants are the plants we want.
[01:40.280 --> 01:45.440]  The female plants make those sticky, icky buds, those sweet aromas, the big fat nuggets,
[01:45.440 --> 01:46.440]  the trichomes.
[01:46.440 --> 01:48.400]  The trichomes are what we all are after.
[01:48.400 --> 01:51.220]  That is where the potency is hidden, is in those trichomes.
[01:51.220 --> 01:54.400]  So the female plants are what we seek in our garden.
[01:54.400 --> 01:59.200]  Unless you are breeding, unless you seek to make seeds to pollinate your crop, male
[01:59.200 --> 02:01.640]  plants are not useful in most gardens.
[02:01.640 --> 02:02.640]  I am a seed breeder.
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.280]  I like a male plant.
[02:04.280 --> 02:09.000]  Unless you want seeds in your garden, I would say get rid of the male plants as soon as
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.280]  you can identify a male plant.
[02:11.280 --> 02:13.900]  So the male plants produce pollen.
[02:13.900 --> 02:17.620]  The pollen is applied or lands on a female plant.
[02:17.620 --> 02:21.400]  That female plant receives that pollen and that plant will make seeds.
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.320]  So if you have a male that produces pollen and a female plant that is about 12 to 28
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.160]  days into flower, maybe a little bit later, if the pollen from that male plant gets on
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.000]  that female plant that is in flower, it has got to be in the flowering phase, about 12,
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.960]  maybe a little earlier, 10 to 28 days, maybe 32 days into flower, if that pollen gets on
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.520]  that plant, that plant will finish with seeds inside of it.
[02:44.520 --> 02:47.640]  The way that we prevent those seeds is by removing the male from the garden, like I
[02:47.640 --> 02:50.920]  have stated before, as early as possible.
[02:50.940 --> 02:53.000]  So we need to detect those boys.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.220]  Listen to the sexing episode that will tell you how to make your plants show you male
[02:57.220 --> 02:59.560]  or female a little bit sooner.
[02:59.560 --> 03:03.100]  Now we've talked about the function and roles of the male and female plant.
[03:03.100 --> 03:04.640]  The male plant makes pollen.
[03:04.640 --> 03:06.500]  The female plant makes buds.
[03:06.500 --> 03:10.980]  The buds happen or the seeding happens if the pollen touches that female plant during
[03:10.980 --> 03:14.000]  a crucial point in the flowering phase.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.580]  Vegetative plants do not produce pollen.
[03:16.580 --> 03:18.600]  Vegetative plants do not produce pistils.
[03:18.600 --> 03:21.080]  Therefore you can't do any breeding with vegetative plants.
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.760]  If you've got problems, accidental pollinations or light leaks or something like that in veg,
[03:25.760 --> 03:27.280]  you're going to be okay.
[03:27.280 --> 03:33.240]  Now I think this is the appropriate time to talk about identifying male and female plants.
[03:33.240 --> 03:34.300]  Let's do ladies first.
[03:34.300 --> 03:37.080]  That seems classy and the female plants are what we are after.
[03:37.080 --> 03:42.960]  So right now on the screen, I'm going to display a classic picture of the early flowering female
[03:42.960 --> 03:43.960]  plant.
[03:43.960 --> 03:45.480]  You can see these little, I'm going to call them hairs.
[03:45.480 --> 03:48.680]  That is not the correct word, but everybody can follow along with me right here.
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.280]  These little hairs sticking out, these are the female pre flower parts.
[03:52.280 --> 03:55.000]  Now I'm going to pop up a picture of a male plant.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.160]  The part that looks like a little nub right there, maybe a little wart, maybe a little
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.560]  thing popping out.
[03:59.560 --> 04:02.520]  That is the beginning of a male flower.
[04:02.520 --> 04:04.200]  That part is going to have pollen.
[04:04.200 --> 04:08.680]  I'm going to place a picture of a female plant that's a little bit further into flower.
[04:08.680 --> 04:13.840]  Now those little fuzzy hairs that you see are the parts that would receive the pollen.
[04:13.840 --> 04:15.840]  That is where the pollen would land.
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.280]  That is, uh, would slide up into another part of that plant and it would make a seed.
[04:19.280 --> 04:21.000]  We're not going to go too far into breeding terms.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.880]  That's not what we're here for, but those little fuzzy dandelion parts that you see,
[04:25.880 --> 04:28.000]  those are the female plants.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.780]  Now let's show you a male plant.
[04:29.780 --> 04:32.600]  This plant on the screen now is a male plant.
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.760]  The best way I can describe it is you see those balls.
[04:35.760 --> 04:38.440]  Those balls are what are going to produce the pollen.
[04:38.440 --> 04:40.820]  That is what we need to get out of the room.
[04:40.820 --> 04:45.060]  So if you've got those beautiful dandelion looking parts, those are what are going to
[04:45.060 --> 04:46.060]  receive pollen.
[04:46.060 --> 04:47.540]  You have got female plants.
[04:47.540 --> 04:52.020]  If you are seeing those balls, you have got yourself a male plant and it is time to get
[04:52.020 --> 04:57.020]  that dude out of the grow room before he dumps his pollen and pollinates your plants.
[04:57.020 --> 05:00.060]  Most of the time those male plants will drop their pollen.
[05:00.060 --> 05:02.940]  Early guys will get going around day 10 of flower.
[05:02.940 --> 05:06.780]  Some of the later going dudes will take 14 to 17 days.
[05:06.780 --> 05:11.220]  Now keep in mind if your male plant has been stressed, if it wasn't getting enough light,
[05:11.220 --> 05:15.260]  if there was something off in that grow room, maybe it got root bound, maybe he just was
[05:15.260 --> 05:16.940]  eager to flower.
[05:16.940 --> 05:21.400]  Sometimes they will begin to pre flower while they are still in veg if there are issues.
[05:21.400 --> 05:26.180]  As soon as you put that bad bitch into flower, put it under 12, 12, it will say, but boom,
[05:26.180 --> 05:28.740]  and just in a few days it will start dumping pollen.
[05:28.740 --> 05:31.580]  So we need to pay very close attention to our plants.
[05:31.580 --> 05:37.080]  In the beginning of flower, look every day for the first 14 to 21 days to make sure you
[05:37.080 --> 05:40.300]  are identifying male and female plants.
[05:40.300 --> 05:43.780]  Also there is the dreaded intersex plant.
[05:43.780 --> 05:47.220]  I'll try to find a good picture of an intersex plant that's got fair use rights and I'll
[05:47.220 --> 05:49.340]  display it on the screen right about here.
[05:49.340 --> 05:52.060]  But right now you're looking at an intersex plant.
[05:52.060 --> 05:55.220]  That plant has male and female parts.
[05:55.220 --> 05:57.480]  That plant will be problematic in your grow.
[05:57.480 --> 06:01.840]  If those male plants, those male parts on that plant open up and create pollen, it will
[06:01.840 --> 06:06.000]  pollinate not only that plant itself, but all of the other plants in the grow.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.840]  And then you will have seeded plants.
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.280]  And in my opinion, I don't like those seeds because they come from a plant that was hermaphroditic,
[06:12.280 --> 06:16.200]  which is going to make more hermaphroditic plants, which will continue the struggle in
[06:16.200 --> 06:17.200]  the garden.
[06:17.200 --> 06:23.040]  So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, that is my brief report on identifying males, females,
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.960]  and intersex plants in your garden.
[06:24.960 --> 06:28.200]  If you've got any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I would love
