[00:31.770 --> 00:33.250]  if you're a cannabis activist,

[01:03.670 --> 01:04.510]  Maybe you're listening to this
[01:04.510 --> 01:05.390]  while you're driving to the mall
[01:05.390 --> 01:08.310]  to grab that last minute gift or whatever you gotta do.
[01:08.310 --> 01:09.470]  Anyway, no matter what holiday
[01:09.470 --> 01:11.270]  you're celebrating this season,

[01:13.950 --> 01:14.790]  and some good food.
[01:14.790 --> 01:16.030]  And most importantly,
[01:16.030 --> 01:17.550]  I hope you're surrounded by some good Terps.
[01:17.550 --> 01:18.550]  I hope you got a fat joint.
[01:18.550 --> 01:21.270]  I hope you got a good dab, maybe some edibles.

[01:22.110 --> 01:23.270]  at the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23.270 --> 01:25.550]  I hope you are getting baked out of your mind
[01:25.550 --> 01:26.690]  this holiday season.

[01:55.710 --> 01:57.430]  is gonna give me a nice fat dab.

[02:28.610 --> 02:32.450]  I'm hitting my Hitman and Samson collab.
[02:32.450 --> 02:33.450]  It's one of my favorite rigs.
[02:33.450 --> 02:34.650]  It's got a nice tall can.
[02:34.650 --> 02:36.710]  It's got a nice wide mouthpiece on it.
[02:36.710 --> 02:37.950]  It gives me big fat rips.
[02:37.950 --> 02:39.810]  I've got it hooked up to the e-nail.
[02:39.810 --> 02:42.170]  So I'm gonna let the music play for a couple of seconds
[02:42.170 --> 02:44.130]  and I'm gonna take a couple of fat dabs.
[02:44.850 --> 02:47.850]  When I come back, I will be joined on the microphone
[02:47.850 --> 02:50.930]  by the Terpex crew and the Clear Concentrate crew
[02:50.930 --> 02:52.730]  from the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[02:52.730 --> 02:55.130]  So let's take a dab and I will be right back.

[03:00.620 --> 03:02.980]  So behave yourselves for just a couple of seconds.
[03:02.980 --> 03:03.900]  All right guys, we are back.
[03:03.900 --> 03:06.360]  We are here at the house at the Dude It's Gatsby
[03:06.360 --> 03:07.200]  Invitational.
[03:07.200 --> 03:09.020]  This will be round two.
[03:09.020 --> 03:10.500]  This time it's more of the bros.
[03:10.500 --> 03:12.540]  The ladies have gone downstairs to quote unquote,
[03:12.540 --> 03:14.740]  take shots bitches is what I think I heard
[03:14.740 --> 03:15.860]  was gonna happen down there.
[03:15.860 --> 03:17.660]  So I hope the ladies are taking a shot for me.
[03:17.660 --> 03:21.700]  They're gonna take like two shots between the five of them.
[03:21.700 --> 03:22.540]  Between the five of them,
[03:22.540 --> 03:25.300]  there's like probably 300 pounds of people down there.
[03:25.300 --> 03:26.140]  Yeah.
[03:26.140 --> 03:26.960]  All right.
[03:26.960 --> 03:27.800]  So sitting to the left,
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.460]  Cocker Daniel on Instagram.
[03:30.460 --> 03:34.060]  If you wanna stalk him, it's Cocker underscore Daniel.
[03:34.060 --> 03:36.340]  I'd known you first from CCC420
[03:36.340 --> 03:37.780]  is where I think I first discovered you.
[03:37.780 --> 03:38.620]  Yes.
[03:38.620 --> 03:39.440]  Yes.
[03:39.440 --> 03:41.980]  I hear you're coming back on the CCC420, the triple C420.
[03:41.980 --> 03:44.500]  I hear you're coming back, making a re-emergence.
[03:44.500 --> 03:45.460]  We actually are.
[03:46.100 --> 03:47.100]  Yeah, we're shooting for January.
[03:47.100 --> 03:48.500]  I actually forgot about that.
[03:48.500 --> 03:49.700]  You forgot about it?
[03:49.700 --> 03:51.540]  I didn't forget about it, but it's nice.
[03:51.540 --> 03:53.420]  He was a little bit distracted the last few days.
[03:53.420 --> 03:54.260]  Let's just put it that way.
[03:54.260 --> 03:55.620]  Yeah, I forgot it was something we could bring up.
[03:55.620 --> 03:56.460]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:56.460 --> 03:57.380]  There's been some distractions.
[03:57.380 --> 03:58.700]  Coming back in January.
[03:58.700 --> 04:01.340]  Hopefully that'll be another success,
[04:01.340 --> 04:02.660]  like the first go around.
[04:02.660 --> 04:03.500]  Nice.
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.700]  Well, congrats on coming back.
[04:04.700 --> 04:06.220]  I hope to see you back on YouTube.
[04:06.220 --> 04:07.060]  Yep.
[04:07.060 --> 04:07.900]  The YouTube misses you.
[04:07.900 --> 04:09.780]  All the weed reviews, all the dab reviews.
[04:09.780 --> 04:10.620]  Yeah.
[04:10.620 --> 04:11.460]  Yeah, you guys getting just too stoned
[04:11.460 --> 04:12.280]  and sitting there.
[04:12.280 --> 04:13.120]  All the dab kids.
[04:13.120 --> 04:13.960]  Yeah.
[04:13.960 --> 04:14.780]  Oh, and since he's over here talking,
[04:14.820 --> 04:15.660]  it's my buddy Jordan.
[04:15.660 --> 04:16.500]  How you doing, brother?
[04:16.500 --> 04:17.340]  I'm doing excellent.
[04:17.340 --> 04:18.180]  How are you doing, Jeff?
[04:18.180 --> 04:19.060]  Dude, I'm dabbed out.
[04:19.060 --> 04:20.420]  We're hanging out here at this beautiful house
[04:20.420 --> 04:21.860]  in Springs on the top of a mountain.
[04:21.860 --> 04:24.420]  I can see all of Colorado Springs through the fog.
[04:24.420 --> 04:25.260]  It's gorgeous, bro.
[04:25.260 --> 04:26.180]  Lovely Colorado Springs.
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.020]  719.
[04:27.020 --> 04:27.860]  719.
[04:27.860 --> 04:29.940]  The pearl of Colorado and the Midwest.
[04:29.940 --> 04:30.980]  It's gonna get redonk, you guys.
[04:30.980 --> 04:32.540]  So I hope you're prepared for this.
[04:32.540 --> 04:34.140]  It's gonna be a very interesting episode.
[04:34.140 --> 04:36.060]  If you guys wanna follow my buddy Jordan,

[04:41.740 --> 04:43.100]  Granddaddy Purple Incorporated.
[04:43.100 --> 04:44.340]  I don't know why you'd rep that, Stray.
[04:44.900 --> 04:46.180]  That is one of my least favorite strains ever, bro.
[04:46.180 --> 04:47.500]  Well, it shows what you know.
[04:47.500 --> 04:48.980]  These guys asked me for a cut of it today.
[04:48.980 --> 04:49.820]  That's our favorite.
[04:49.820 --> 04:52.300]  I love you guys still.
[04:52.300 --> 04:53.660]  All right, and over here speaking on the phone,
[04:53.660 --> 04:54.940]  who was on the phone?
[04:54.940 --> 04:55.820]  Why did I say phone?
[04:55.820 --> 04:56.660]  That's how high I am.
[04:56.660 --> 04:57.700]  Over there on the microphone,
[04:57.700 --> 04:59.580]  the guy that I just met last night, he's cool as shit.
[04:59.580 --> 05:01.100]  This is the guy we call the clear scientist.
[05:01.100 --> 05:01.940]  My buddy, Chris.
[05:01.940 --> 05:02.760]  How you doing, brother?
[05:02.760 --> 05:03.600]  I'm doing excellent.

[05:05.500 --> 05:06.500]  We all high up here.
[05:06.500 --> 05:07.620]  We're all altitude high.
[05:07.620 --> 05:08.460]  Overlooking Colorado Springs.
[05:08.460 --> 05:09.300]  We're Medicaid high.
[05:09.300 --> 05:10.580]  719.
[05:10.580 --> 05:12.020]  It's very excellent.
[05:12.020 --> 05:12.900]  Well, thanks for joining me on the show.
[05:12.900 --> 05:15.380]  Here comes a beautiful Ms. Damsel sneaking through.
[05:15.380 --> 05:16.220]  Nice, nice.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.220]  And here's a guy I just met today.
[05:17.220 --> 05:18.180]  This guy's name's Brian.
[05:18.180 --> 05:19.980]  He's got a really fantabulous long name.
[05:19.980 --> 05:22.380]  What do they call you, my friend?
[05:22.380 --> 05:23.340]  The mad alchemist.
[05:23.340 --> 05:24.580]  The mad alchemist.
[05:24.580 --> 05:25.880]  Do you have an Instagram that you'd like people
[05:25.880 --> 05:27.620]  to stalk you on while they're listening to the show?
[05:27.620 --> 05:28.460]  No.
[05:28.460 --> 05:29.280]  No, you're low key.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.120]  All right.
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.340]  Kind of like a low key kind of dude.
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.500]  I hear you're into some cool shit,
[05:32.500 --> 05:34.660]  so we may open the doors to talk about some of that stuff
[05:34.660 --> 05:35.660]  here in the near future.
[05:35.660 --> 05:36.820]  I do like cool shit.
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.660]  Nice, nice.
[05:37.660 --> 05:40.100]  You guys, I hear that you two, Chris and Brian,
[05:40.100 --> 05:43.480]  are like the hash mad scientists.
[05:44.460 --> 05:45.300]  People say that.
[05:45.300 --> 05:48.220]  It's kind of just the good.
[05:48.220 --> 05:49.500]  I'll go ahead and say that.
[05:49.500 --> 05:50.700]  They are, yes.
[05:50.700 --> 05:54.660]  Can I ask about the product that I heard about a minute ago?
[05:54.660 --> 05:55.500]  The mother's milk?
[05:55.500 --> 05:56.900]  Can I ask you guys about that?
[05:56.900 --> 05:58.540]  Are you ready to talk about that on a podcast,
[05:58.540 --> 06:01.140]  or is that something we have to keep on the down low?
[06:01.140 --> 06:02.940]  We can talk about it.
[06:02.940 --> 06:04.940]  I'd like to hear about that a little bit.
[06:04.940 --> 06:07.340]  They'll reveal what they can.
[06:07.340 --> 06:08.180]  Okay, yeah, yeah.
[06:08.180 --> 06:09.460]  Yeah, you know, if I ask too many questions,
[06:09.780 --> 06:10.620]  just tell me I'm out of line.
[06:10.620 --> 06:13.060]  It's really mostly this guy.
[06:13.060 --> 06:14.020]  So, Brian, really?
[06:14.020 --> 06:17.380]  It's a water-soluble hash oil solution.
[06:17.380 --> 06:21.420]  And so you can put, you make the solution,
[06:21.420 --> 06:25.020]  so you say, oh, this has got five or 10 milligrams
[06:25.020 --> 06:26.740]  per milliliter of solution.
[06:26.740 --> 06:29.860]  So then you're gonna have a little test tube
[06:29.860 --> 06:31.780]  or some volumetric flask or something
[06:31.780 --> 06:33.620]  and measure out exactly how many milligrams
[06:33.620 --> 06:34.740]  you're gonna wanna get.
[06:34.740 --> 06:38.540]  And then it's potent and it works and it lasts.
[06:38.660 --> 06:40.340]  I wanna try it.
[06:40.340 --> 06:42.380]  Yes, we all wanna try some of that.
[06:42.380 --> 06:45.820]  Hunt likes the Dr. Pepper mix.
[06:45.820 --> 06:48.020]  I was just gonna say, I would like to drop some
[06:48.020 --> 06:48.860]  in my Dr. Pepper.
[06:48.860 --> 06:50.660]  I hear it hits you within like 15 minutes.
[06:50.660 --> 06:51.580]  It does, or sooner.
[06:51.580 --> 06:53.980]  Yeah, it's definitely the 24th flavor in there, for sure.
[06:53.980 --> 06:55.300]  The 24th flavor in my Dr. Pepper.
[06:55.300 --> 06:57.540]  How long does it last, like a normal edible?
[06:59.020 --> 07:00.140]  Consensus, I mean.
[07:00.140 --> 07:01.740]  If you can stay awake long enough.
[07:01.740 --> 07:02.660]  If you can stay awake.
[07:02.660 --> 07:03.740]  Compare the two.
[07:03.740 --> 07:04.580]  All right.
[07:04.580 --> 07:06.260]  If you take enough, it lasts a really long time.
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.300]  Hunt, would you like to testify on this matter?
[07:08.980 --> 07:10.260]  We're gonna bring to the mic our buddy Hunt,
[07:10.260 --> 07:11.100]  the Grammy Gatsby.
[07:11.100 --> 07:11.940]  He's hanging out in the room.
[07:11.940 --> 07:13.460]  Let's tell us a little bit about what happens
[07:13.460 --> 07:14.980]  when you have consumed the mother's milk.
[07:14.980 --> 07:16.340]  How do you like this stuff?
[07:17.420 --> 07:18.700]  It is a...
[07:18.700 --> 07:20.180]  Straight from the teat.
[07:20.180 --> 07:25.180]  It is a smokeless, immediate type of effect
[07:25.180 --> 07:27.980]  where literally after three or four sips
[07:27.980 --> 07:31.180]  or a couple straws worth, you can feel it.
[07:31.180 --> 07:33.540]  And if the drink is potent enough,
[07:33.540 --> 07:35.740]  within five to 10 minutes,
[07:35.740 --> 07:38.420]  you're at pretty much euphoria.
[07:38.420 --> 07:40.580]  And it also compounds itself
[07:40.580 --> 07:42.300]  or some sort of like multiplier
[07:42.300 --> 07:46.060]  where it's like if there's 60 milligrams in the cup,
[07:46.060 --> 07:49.260]  it really feels like 200 milligrams when you drink it.
[07:50.900 --> 07:54.180]  And some batches in the R&D phase
[07:54.180 --> 07:56.740]  were extremely terpy and unpleasant.
[07:56.740 --> 08:00.820]  And other batches have been refined into perfection.
[08:00.820 --> 08:01.860]  Very nice.
[08:01.860 --> 08:02.700]  Very nice.
[08:02.700 --> 08:03.980]  Well, thanks for your testimony, kind sir.
[08:03.980 --> 08:05.900]  If you ever wanna grab a mic, just jump in, dude.
[08:05.900 --> 08:06.820]  I know you're hanging out over there.
[08:06.820 --> 08:07.740]  Enjoy yourself.
[08:07.740 --> 08:08.700]  Squad up.
[08:08.700 --> 08:09.540]  Nice.
[08:09.540 --> 08:10.860]  So I guess the golden question is,
[08:10.860 --> 08:12.620]  do you bring any of this shit, bro?
[08:13.580 --> 08:14.780]  No, I failed on that front, man.
[08:14.780 --> 08:16.700]  I didn't know I was coming in until a couple hours ago.
[08:16.700 --> 08:17.540]  That's all right.
[08:17.540 --> 08:19.220]  I've got over an hour drive home and it's snowing
[08:19.220 --> 08:20.860]  and it's gonna be a bobsled ride
[08:20.860 --> 08:22.540]  getting down this mountain where we are.
[08:22.540 --> 08:23.620]  This place is beautiful,
[08:23.620 --> 08:25.740]  but getting down tonight in the dark.
[08:25.740 --> 08:26.620]  Dude, how about the deer?
[08:26.620 --> 08:28.460]  Anybody else experienced the deer?
[08:28.460 --> 08:30.940]  Yes, we did experience the deer.
[08:30.940 --> 08:32.060]  That was some crazy shit.
[08:32.580 --> 08:35.060]  I grew up in Ohio,
[08:35.060 --> 08:37.020]  lived in Colorado here for a couple years.
[08:37.020 --> 08:39.100]  And when we lived down here in Colorado Springs,
[08:39.100 --> 08:40.420]  I mean, I always knew the deers
[08:40.420 --> 08:43.380]  to be pretty damn friendly and fearless.
[08:43.380 --> 08:47.180]  But this motherfucker was trying to get in on the cypher
[08:47.180 --> 08:48.100]  or some shit,
[08:48.100 --> 08:49.020]  because he-
[08:49.020 --> 08:49.860]  He liked the weed smoke, man.
[08:49.860 --> 08:51.380]  He backed down like eight of us
[08:51.380 --> 08:53.020]  where I'm sitting around smoking in a circle.
[08:53.020 --> 08:55.380]  This fool came over, startled us.
[08:55.380 --> 08:57.460]  We slowly walked back to the house.
[08:57.460 --> 08:59.660]  He just like literally backed us into a corner.
[08:59.660 --> 09:00.500]  Into the door.
[09:00.500 --> 09:01.700]  We pulled up into the driveway.
[09:02.340 --> 09:03.300]  He stopped in front of the cars
[09:03.300 --> 09:04.220]  and looked at us like,
[09:04.220 --> 09:05.540]  you got the pass or what?
[09:05.540 --> 09:07.580]  And then he came up to my window like 10 bucks.
[09:07.580 --> 09:08.540]  He'd look at me in the eye,
[09:08.540 --> 09:09.380]  look at my joint.
[09:09.380 --> 09:10.860]  Yeah, that dude was serious.
[09:10.860 --> 09:11.740]  He looked at me in the eye again.
[09:11.740 --> 09:13.180]  I dropped the joint, little scab.
[09:13.180 --> 09:15.700]  At one point I bent down to
[09:17.780 --> 09:19.260]  put the blunt out and like-
[09:19.260 --> 09:20.740]  Yeah, that's what you bent over for, right?
[09:20.740 --> 09:21.580]  He got in charge.
[09:21.580 --> 09:23.180]  Oh, you started this.
[09:23.180 --> 09:25.140]  He got ready to charge though.
[09:25.140 --> 09:25.980]  He was ready.
[09:25.980 --> 09:26.820]  He was like a four point,
[09:26.820 --> 09:28.220]  nice four point, right?
[09:28.220 --> 09:30.020]  I think he's like eight point, man.
[09:30.020 --> 09:30.860]  He's big.
[09:31.220 --> 09:32.060]  Chris, what was he?
[09:32.060 --> 09:32.900]  Would not have been any fun.
[09:32.900 --> 09:33.740]  He was an eight pointer.
[09:33.740 --> 09:35.940]  He was an eight point buck, man.
[09:35.940 --> 09:36.780]  I'll tell you what-
[09:36.780 --> 09:38.420]  I thought about wrangling him myself.
[09:38.420 --> 09:39.260]  Bring that one home.
[09:39.260 --> 09:41.780]  Yeah, Chris was gonna give him a grapple,
[09:41.780 --> 09:43.060]  but who said I would?
[09:43.060 --> 09:44.380]  Chris, tornado him.
[09:44.380 --> 09:46.780]  I need my camo on.
[09:46.780 --> 09:48.020]  What are you guys was serious about?
[09:48.020 --> 09:49.580]  I'm gonna get him by the horns.
[09:49.580 --> 09:50.620]  I'm gonna wrassle him.
[09:50.620 --> 09:51.460]  Yeah.
[09:51.460 --> 09:52.300]  I'd love to have seen that.
[09:52.300 --> 09:53.620]  If he comes back tonight, I'll do it.
[09:53.620 --> 09:55.060]  I know jujitsu, man.
[09:55.060 --> 09:55.900]  I'm gonna get him.
[09:55.900 --> 09:58.340]  I can play the spoons and the washboard too.
[09:58.340 --> 10:00.220]  Jujitsu don't work on deer, bro.
[10:01.020 --> 10:01.860]  That's what she said.
[10:01.860 --> 10:03.300]  All right.
[10:03.300 --> 10:04.900]  Can I even ask you about the clear?
[10:04.900 --> 10:05.940]  Am I allowed to ask?
[10:05.940 --> 10:06.780]  What do you wanna know?
[10:06.780 --> 10:07.860]  What can you tell me about the clear?
[10:07.860 --> 10:10.220]  A lot of my listeners, this is listened to people,
[10:10.220 --> 10:12.620]  have listened to by people from all over the world.
[10:12.620 --> 10:15.220]  Not just people in Colorado or Cali that know what's up.
[10:15.220 --> 10:18.180]  A lot of the people listening have a hard time finding pot.
[10:18.180 --> 10:20.780]  So the clear, if you just wanna tell them
[10:20.780 --> 10:23.660]  kind of basically, they probably know about shatter
[10:23.660 --> 10:24.900]  and basic hashes from listening,
[10:24.900 --> 10:25.900]  but if you wanna give them an update
[10:25.900 --> 10:28.220]  on what the clear actually is, that'd be awesome.
[10:28.220 --> 10:33.220]  So clear is a brand of a product that we,
[10:33.660 --> 10:36.580]  started a couple years ago in California.
[10:36.580 --> 10:39.900]  And it was sort of the first, I guess,
[10:39.900 --> 10:44.900]  popularized and purified cannabis oil
[10:45.100 --> 10:47.500]  that we coined the name the clear
[10:47.500 --> 10:51.860]  because it was always a nice high clarity and low color.
[10:52.940 --> 10:55.500]  And kind of we're one of the first quote,
[10:55.540 --> 10:58.860]  solvent free companies that existed.
[10:58.860 --> 11:02.140]  And so people have their own ways
[11:02.140 --> 11:04.380]  of making these activated cannabinoids,
[11:04.380 --> 11:05.380]  decolorized and stuff.
[11:05.380 --> 11:06.980]  And so we don't really speak to how we do it.
[11:06.980 --> 11:08.500]  We'd like to just keep it always a secret.
[11:08.500 --> 11:09.340]  Much respect.
[11:09.340 --> 11:11.980]  And so other people do it and tell you how they do it.
[11:11.980 --> 11:13.820]  But as far as us, we kind of stick
[11:13.820 --> 11:16.060]  to just a purification method
[11:16.060 --> 11:19.660]  and we have our own particulars as to what machines we use.
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.060]  We build a lot of our own machines
[11:21.060 --> 11:22.780]  and have our own processes and things like that.
[11:22.780 --> 11:25.180]  So it's kind of just particulars
[11:25.180 --> 11:27.380]  and we have our own like unique flavors
[11:27.380 --> 11:30.300]  that we then will blend back in and all natural flavors
[11:31.540 --> 11:33.660]  that can range from cannabis type flavors
[11:33.660 --> 11:35.980]  that have high terpene content to like,
[11:35.980 --> 11:38.020]  you know, your standard strawberry or grape.
[11:38.020 --> 11:40.420]  And, you know, we have sort of a flavor department
[11:40.420 --> 11:42.460]  that we, you know, pump out different flavors
[11:42.460 --> 11:43.420]  and try to keep the flavor.
[11:43.420 --> 11:46.540]  Are those flavors derived from cannabis or other products?
[11:46.540 --> 11:48.060]  So they're all derived from other products.
[11:48.060 --> 11:49.180]  Okay. Everything's natural
[11:49.180 --> 11:50.420]  and none of them are like,
[11:50.420 --> 11:51.460]  every like, you know, for instance,
[11:51.660 --> 11:53.300]  the terpenes that we use are steam distilled
[11:53.300 --> 11:55.860]  and all the flavors we use are, you know, high grade
[11:55.860 --> 11:59.260]  and are all, you know, based off of like,
[11:59.260 --> 12:00.500]  you know, a lot of essential oils
[12:00.500 --> 12:01.700]  and, you know, things like that.
[12:01.700 --> 12:02.540]  So we have, you know, lime oils and orange oils.
[12:02.540 --> 12:04.140]  You're not getting Chinese things.
[12:04.140 --> 12:04.980]  No, no.
[12:04.980 --> 12:06.460]  And we try to make sure that these are like
[12:06.460 --> 12:08.540]  the highest grade stuff, nothing Chinese sourced.
[12:08.540 --> 12:09.380]  Everything's a hybrid.
[12:09.380 --> 12:10.500]  I've talked to you for a couple of nights
[12:10.500 --> 12:11.340]  and I trust you.
[12:11.340 --> 12:13.820]  I trust your judgment on that kind of product so far.
[12:13.820 --> 12:15.820]  Yeah. And so, you know, there's a lot of,
[12:16.740 --> 12:18.340]  you know, great uses for products like this.
[12:18.340 --> 12:20.020]  We can use them for topicals and edibles
[12:20.020 --> 12:22.780]  and vapor cartridges and anything you can really want
[12:22.780 --> 12:24.540]  of a, you know, formulate.
[12:24.540 --> 12:25.620]  So it's kind of cool.
[12:25.620 --> 12:27.220]  Right. I hear a lot of good things about the clear.
[12:27.220 --> 12:28.900]  We'll have to get our hands on some.
[12:28.900 --> 12:29.740]  Hunt, hunt.
[12:29.740 --> 12:30.980]  I think that's your department.
[12:30.980 --> 12:34.260]  Yeah. It's out there.
[12:34.260 --> 12:35.100]  A few people that have it.
[12:35.100 --> 12:37.020]  It's just in Denver, not in the Springs yet.
[12:37.020 --> 12:39.020]  So I got to drive to Denver to get it.
[12:39.020 --> 12:42.980]  We are slowly making our distribution through Colorado.
[12:42.980 --> 12:43.820]  There you go.
[12:43.820 --> 12:44.660]  Bigger and wider.
[12:44.660 --> 12:46.180]  So greener, green and healthy wellness is interested.
[12:46.180 --> 12:47.020]  I think.
[12:48.460 --> 12:49.300]  Let's put that together.
[12:49.620 --> 12:50.460]  I hear the boss is behind me laughing.
[12:50.460 --> 12:52.220]  He's like, Hey, wait, how can you say that?
[12:52.220 --> 12:53.060]  You do the grow.
[12:53.060 --> 12:53.940]  I'll do the managing.
[12:53.940 --> 12:55.100]  You shut your face.
[12:57.660 --> 13:00.060]  All right, Jordan, what's up with Turpex, bro?
[13:00.060 --> 13:01.900]  Hey dude, thanks for the update on the clear.
[13:01.900 --> 13:02.740]  I appreciate that.
[13:02.740 --> 13:03.580]  You got it.
[13:03.580 --> 13:05.140]  I appreciate it.
[13:05.140 --> 13:07.100]  What's up with the Turpex brother?
[13:07.100 --> 13:09.180]  We are, you know,
[13:09.180 --> 13:11.940]  we're doing recreational processing up in Denver right now.
[13:11.940 --> 13:13.740]  We're still doing medical processing down here
[13:13.740 --> 13:15.260]  in Colorado Springs.
[13:15.260 --> 13:18.740]  And I have a pretty large grow that is about to be up
[13:19.180 --> 13:21.620]  and running for our medical wholesale.
[13:22.580 --> 13:24.620]  Gonna have a lot of really awesome flavors
[13:24.620 --> 13:26.220]  that we're gonna be making out of there.
[13:26.220 --> 13:28.060]  Everything that gets grown in that facility
[13:28.060 --> 13:29.620]  has to be extracted.
[13:31.300 --> 13:33.340]  So, you know, we'll have a lot of really,
[13:33.340 --> 13:34.980]  really awesome turps on the market.
[13:34.980 --> 13:36.180]  It has to be extracted.
[13:36.180 --> 13:37.020]  Has to be extracted.
[13:37.020 --> 13:38.100]  A lot of underground earls, bro.
[13:38.100 --> 13:38.940]  Nice.
[13:38.940 --> 13:39.980]  Nothing wrong with turps.
[13:39.980 --> 13:40.820]  Full plant run.
[13:40.820 --> 13:41.660]  Turps, yep.
[13:42.700 --> 13:45.220]  Then also, you know, it's gonna be a pretty exciting month.
[13:45.220 --> 13:49.700]  We are going out to Illinois in the middle of this month
[13:49.700 --> 13:52.780]  and we are doing some consulting out there
[13:52.780 --> 13:56.700]  with one of the first operators to get up and running
[13:56.700 --> 13:58.180]  for medical cannabis in Illinois.
[13:58.180 --> 14:02.060]  We're gonna be going out there to extract their crop
[14:02.060 --> 14:05.540]  and, you know, help get their processing operation going.
[14:05.540 --> 14:08.220]  Help them with some of the, you know,
[14:08.220 --> 14:09.620]  processing preparation, you know,
[14:09.620 --> 14:10.580]  trimming and all that kind of stuff.
[14:10.580 --> 14:11.860]  Expand the brand.
[14:11.860 --> 14:12.700]  That's awesome.
[14:13.100 --> 14:15.180]  That's not really a brand situation.
[14:15.180 --> 14:18.940]  You know, the market in Illinois is very small.
[14:18.940 --> 14:21.420]  That's more of like a consultation help, you know,
[14:21.420 --> 14:24.340]  kind of do like a co-brand private label type situation
[14:24.340 --> 14:27.700]  where we go out there and help create their brand,
[14:27.700 --> 14:29.500]  which is, you know, one of the first, you know,
[14:29.500 --> 14:34.500]  they'll have some of the first infused products available
[14:34.500 --> 14:36.300]  in the Illinois medical cannabis market
[14:36.300 --> 14:37.140]  and probably, you know,
[14:37.140 --> 14:40.140]  be some of the first legal butane extractions to be done
[14:40.140 --> 14:41.780]  in that state, if not the first.
[14:42.740 --> 14:45.780]  We're also going to be getting up and running
[14:45.780 --> 14:48.540]  in Las Vegas within the next month,
[14:48.540 --> 14:50.980]  which should also be very exciting.
[14:50.980 --> 14:52.420]  So that'll be right about when this comes out.
[14:52.420 --> 14:54.020]  This will probably come out in about two or three weeks.
[14:54.020 --> 14:55.540]  So right when this drops.
[14:55.540 --> 14:57.740]  Well, yeah, hopefully that will be right around the time,
[14:57.740 --> 14:59.300]  around the first of the year where we're getting up
[14:59.300 --> 15:00.460]  and running in Las Vegas.
[15:00.460 --> 15:03.740]  That will be, you know, Turpex branded products
[15:03.740 --> 15:04.620]  that we're gonna be, you know,
[15:04.620 --> 15:07.820]  selling wax, shatter, vape pens, things like that
[15:07.820 --> 15:10.180]  throughout the Las Vegas market.
[15:11.020 --> 15:13.660]  You know, we originally came out here from California
[15:13.660 --> 15:15.140]  and it'll be pretty awesome
[15:15.140 --> 15:17.540]  because now California patients will have access
[15:17.540 --> 15:19.500]  to the products that we make again
[15:19.500 --> 15:22.540]  because Nevada has reciprocal medical marijuana laws.
[15:22.540 --> 15:25.540]  So anybody, yeah, reciprocity.
[15:25.540 --> 15:26.860]  Reciprocity.
[15:26.860 --> 15:28.460]  Shout out to Dan for going to English class.
[15:28.460 --> 15:31.260]  That's a grammar lesson that we'll get into later.
[15:31.260 --> 15:32.340]  So if you're in Vegas
[15:32.340 --> 15:34.260]  and you have a California medical marijuana card,
[15:34.260 --> 15:36.300]  you can shop at a Vegas dispensary.
[15:36.300 --> 15:38.580]  You shop at a Vegas dispensary, Reno,
[15:38.580 --> 15:40.020]  any Nevada medical marijuana.
[15:40.860 --> 15:41.820]  You guys take your Colorado card there as well?
[15:41.820 --> 15:42.660]  Yep.
[15:42.660 --> 15:43.500]  Sweet.
[15:43.500 --> 15:44.340]  All right, you guys heard that?
[15:44.340 --> 15:45.620]  Go to Vegas and take your medical marijuana card,
[15:45.620 --> 15:46.940]  go shopping, get some herb.
[15:46.940 --> 15:48.420]  Yep, they are up and running out there.
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.260]  So, you know.
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.740]  Go get some Turpex at the first of the year.
[15:50.740 --> 15:51.700]  Dab it out.
[15:51.700 --> 15:52.540]  Dab it out.
[15:52.540 --> 15:54.820]  Definitely let you guys know where the drops are happening.
[15:54.820 --> 15:58.080]  How much of, so you guys were talking about nug runs.
[15:58.080 --> 16:00.620]  All of the room you're growing has to be made into Earl.
[16:00.620 --> 16:01.620]  What percentage of that?
[16:01.620 --> 16:03.060]  And if I'm out of line, just let me know
[16:03.060 --> 16:04.220]  and I won't ask the question.
[16:04.220 --> 16:06.540]  How much of that product will actually be sold
[16:06.540 --> 16:09.180]  as smokable Earl and how much of it will be sold
[16:09.220 --> 16:12.140]  to a vendor and turned into something like a topical
[16:12.140 --> 16:13.260]  or an edible or something?
[16:13.260 --> 16:16.300]  I would say 100% of that will be sold as smokable oil.
[16:16.300 --> 16:17.140]  Okay.
[16:19.260 --> 16:23.900]  You know, we take pretty good steps in the grow
[16:23.900 --> 16:27.160]  to make sure that we have really high quality.
[16:27.160 --> 16:29.980]  We wish we were able to let people experience the flowers,
[16:29.980 --> 16:32.920]  but the fact that we can take all that high quality
[16:32.920 --> 16:35.220]  flower product and turn it into extract,
[16:36.460 --> 16:39.100]  you know, we want to get as much of that branded Turpex
[16:39.940 --> 16:42.660]  awesome nug run flavor on the market as possible.
[16:42.660 --> 16:44.980]  So I would say most of that product will be sold
[16:44.980 --> 16:46.100]  as smokable oil.
[16:46.100 --> 16:48.660]  If we start delving into other products and find that,
[16:48.660 --> 16:52.980]  you know, it's more beneficial to do things that way.
[16:52.980 --> 16:54.580]  You know, maybe we're working to that now,
[16:54.580 --> 16:56.580]  but right now the plan is to just make,
[16:56.580 --> 16:57.420]  Gram it out.
[16:57.420 --> 16:59.700]  Shatter wax, live resin, maybe some bubble hash.
[16:59.700 --> 17:00.780]  Live resin.
[17:00.780 --> 17:02.180]  You want to talk about live resin for a minute?
[17:02.180 --> 17:05.100]  I heard you say something to a client earlier.
[17:05.100 --> 17:07.060]  The bottom line, bro, what makes it live resin
[17:07.060 --> 17:07.900]  and what doesn't?
[17:07.980 --> 17:10.020]  I've said this on the show and people call me a hater.
[17:10.020 --> 17:11.660]  What makes it live resin?
[17:11.660 --> 17:14.940]  The fact that it's a live plant that's cut down
[17:14.940 --> 17:17.780]  and then frozen before it is dried.
[17:17.780 --> 17:19.460]  Then what machine do you run it through?
[17:19.460 --> 17:24.140]  We use an Emotech at our Colorado operations,
[17:24.140 --> 17:28.580]  as well as the ones that we'll use in Nevada and Illinois.
[17:28.580 --> 17:29.780]  See guys, I didn't even say it.
[17:29.780 --> 17:30.780]  I didn't bait him.
[17:30.780 --> 17:32.180]  We just let him say his thing
[17:32.180 --> 17:34.540]  and he backed up everything I have said.
[17:34.540 --> 17:35.380]  Nice.
[17:35.380 --> 17:36.780]  Thank you, bro.
[17:37.060 --> 17:38.300]  The question really comes down to,
[17:38.300 --> 17:40.660]  there are some little small distinctions in live resin.
[17:40.660 --> 17:43.980]  Some people will dry a slight bit and then freeze
[17:43.980 --> 17:45.460]  versus a full dry.
[17:45.460 --> 17:46.300]  How do you feel?
[17:46.300 --> 17:47.660]  Do you consider that any drying?
[17:47.660 --> 17:48.500]  No.
[17:48.500 --> 17:49.740]  You think it's the immediate cut and freeze?
[17:49.740 --> 17:52.060]  Because some people complain about tubes clogging up
[17:52.060 --> 17:54.060]  with water and doing fucked up shit.
[17:54.060 --> 17:55.700]  Live resin, I would say live resin's
[17:55.700 --> 17:57.260]  really not meant for a tube.
[17:58.940 --> 18:00.140]  The live resin process,
[18:00.140 --> 18:03.420]  because of the way everything gets clogged
[18:03.420 --> 18:04.300]  and everything like that,
[18:04.300 --> 18:06.500]  I just would never recommend doing it in a tube
[18:07.220 --> 18:08.060]  versus a closed system.
[18:08.060 --> 18:10.140]  I would take the same steps as fresh frozen ice water.
[18:10.140 --> 18:11.900]  Instead though, you just blast it.
[18:12.780 --> 18:15.140]  All right, so if I do it through a sweet leaf,
[18:15.140 --> 18:16.740]  am I still making live resin?
[18:16.740 --> 18:18.980]  Is it gonna come out the same?
[18:18.980 --> 18:19.820]  Yeah.
[18:19.820 --> 18:20.660]  I don't know.
[18:20.660 --> 18:22.500]  I've never used one.
[18:22.500 --> 18:24.340]  See, I think theoretically it wouldn't matter
[18:24.340 --> 18:26.580]  like what machine you use.
[18:26.580 --> 18:27.940]  It's kind of like a style, right?
[18:27.940 --> 18:28.780]  Yeah.
[18:28.780 --> 18:29.940]  Kind of like the fact that the plant
[18:29.940 --> 18:31.380]  does not have a chance to dry at all.
[18:31.380 --> 18:34.420]  I mean, the machine's just another variable
[18:34.420 --> 18:35.900]  that you just gotta compensate for
[18:36.300 --> 18:39.340]  to try to get the end product that you're looking for.
[18:39.340 --> 18:41.460]  If the machine operates a little bit differently,
[18:41.460 --> 18:44.020]  just if you have the experience,
[18:44.020 --> 18:45.300]  you figure it out, adjust it,
[18:45.300 --> 18:47.260]  try to compensate and make.
[18:48.460 --> 18:49.820]  It's a process.
[18:49.820 --> 18:52.340]  I don't really think live resin is.
[18:53.780 --> 18:56.420]  What do you guys prefer as far as type of
[18:56.420 --> 18:57.820]  nugg run, cured, long-cured?
[18:57.820 --> 18:58.660]  Fresh dried.
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.500]  Fresh dried.
[18:59.500 --> 19:00.340]  Fresh dried.
[19:00.340 --> 19:01.180]  Yeah, I agree.
[19:01.180 --> 19:03.180]  There's certain strains that come out amazing
[19:03.220 --> 19:06.100]  as live resin that really taste awesome.
[19:06.100 --> 19:08.260]  But I think those are.
[19:08.260 --> 19:09.860]  What's like the tangy tangys?
[19:09.860 --> 19:11.180]  Yeah, like tangy lemon.
[19:11.180 --> 19:12.220]  Death by lemon.
[19:12.220 --> 19:14.900]  All those ones taste amazing as live resin,
[19:14.900 --> 19:18.220]  but all those taste amazing dry cured too.
[19:18.220 --> 19:21.340]  I think the main reason why people like live resin so much
[19:21.340 --> 19:23.180]  is because the color.
[19:23.180 --> 19:24.340]  Yeah, totally.
[19:24.340 --> 19:26.580]  Color brings out a lot of flavor.
[19:26.580 --> 19:27.420]  But certain types of flavor.
[19:27.420 --> 19:28.940]  It does, but I feel like strains.
[19:28.940 --> 19:31.420]  Certain flavors get muted down
[19:31.460 --> 19:33.460]  by this kind of watery thing.
[19:33.460 --> 19:36.180]  Yeah, it's planty, it's vegetative.
[19:36.180 --> 19:38.660]  But certain strains in live resin,
[19:38.660 --> 19:40.220]  the terps are amplified.
[19:40.220 --> 19:42.340]  And other strains, I feel like it takes.
[19:42.340 --> 19:43.940]  Yeah, other strains, I feel like it takes
[19:43.940 --> 19:47.460]  a nice dry and cure to really bring out the terps
[19:47.460 --> 19:48.860]  to their maximum potential.
[19:48.860 --> 19:49.700]  I'll agree with that.
[19:49.700 --> 19:51.540]  But when that happens.
[19:51.540 --> 19:52.580]  I've never tasted a good OG live resin.
[19:52.580 --> 19:53.420]  True.
[19:53.420 --> 19:54.700]  But when that happens,
[19:54.700 --> 19:57.100]  the oil's not gonna be as aesthetically pleasing
[19:57.100 --> 20:00.540]  as if it's cut down early, frozen, and extracted.
[20:00.540 --> 20:01.380]  True.
[20:01.380 --> 20:04.180]  In that form, it's gonna look piss yellow.
[20:06.060 --> 20:08.020]  Yeah, I've learned to take the plants a little bit early
[20:08.020 --> 20:09.260]  if I know they're gonna be oil.
[20:09.260 --> 20:10.700]  It makes it look so much better.
[20:10.700 --> 20:15.700]  It's definitely a tactic that a lot of growers use
[20:16.300 --> 20:17.620]  these days.
[20:17.620 --> 20:18.460]  I just wanna go around the room.
[20:18.460 --> 20:20.460]  What's your favorite strain to smoke as a flower
[20:20.460 --> 20:22.140]  and favorite to dab?
[20:22.140 --> 20:22.980]  That's funny.
[20:22.980 --> 20:24.100]  I was just talking to Chris about this.
[20:24.100 --> 20:26.860]  My favorite was always the SFVOG.
[20:26.860 --> 20:28.700]  And I haven't had it in quite some time.
[20:28.740 --> 20:33.340]  But that's the ultimate in flower and dab form.
[20:33.340 --> 20:35.500]  The San Fernando Valley OG Kush.
[20:35.500 --> 20:36.340]  Yeah.
[20:36.340 --> 20:37.660]  If I asked a lot of people,
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.500]  if I asked a hundred people,
[20:38.500 --> 20:40.540]  I bet 50 of them would say the SFVOG.
[20:40.540 --> 20:41.380]  It's awesome.
[20:41.380 --> 20:42.980]  And probably 40 of them didn't smoke the real one.
[20:42.980 --> 20:44.220]  Yeah, oh, I have.
[20:44.220 --> 20:45.060]  No, I'm sure you have.
[20:45.060 --> 20:46.020]  I know who you are, bro.
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.580]  I know who you are, brother.
[20:47.580 --> 20:49.540]  Oh, Chris is thinking about it already.
[20:50.780 --> 20:51.620]  You want us to skip you for a second?
[20:51.620 --> 20:52.660]  Yeah, I'm gonna pass for a second.
[20:52.660 --> 20:55.140]  All right, Brian, favorite strains?
[20:55.140 --> 20:57.780]  I really like smoking Jack Herrera Flower.
[20:57.780 --> 20:58.620]  Okay.
[20:59.500 --> 21:02.380]  Really any African sativa.
[21:02.380 --> 21:06.820]  I just love the Dermabrasion, the Snowcap.
[21:07.740 --> 21:08.900]  He likes to get shit done.
[21:08.900 --> 21:09.740]  There's just like-
[21:09.740 --> 21:10.900]  Nigerian Nightmare type of stuff.
[21:10.900 --> 21:12.300]  All those guys, they just have that.
[21:12.300 --> 21:14.740]  I think it's terpeneline is the common terpene.
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.260]  There isn't really high prevalence.
[21:16.260 --> 21:18.340]  And I just, I really like those.
[21:18.340 --> 21:20.340]  Get up and do things during your day.
[21:20.340 --> 21:21.540]  I just, I love to dab that.
[21:21.540 --> 21:22.940]  I love to smoke that on flower.
[21:22.940 --> 21:25.860]  It's just, when it's done right, it's done.
[21:25.860 --> 21:27.740]  It can be done so well.
[21:27.780 --> 21:30.100]  I want to assume that terpeneline is a terpenoid.
[21:30.100 --> 21:31.300]  It is, yeah.
[21:31.300 --> 21:32.140]  Correct.
[21:32.140 --> 21:33.340]  Chris wants to talk.
[21:33.340 --> 21:34.180]  Yeah, let's hear it.
[21:34.180 --> 21:35.020]  I want to hear about it.
[21:35.020 --> 21:38.500]  Yeah, terpeneline is one of the isomers of terpene.
[21:38.500 --> 21:39.340]  I can't remember.
[21:39.340 --> 21:40.740]  I believe it's gamma.
[21:40.740 --> 21:41.580]  Terp, terp.
[21:41.580 --> 21:42.420]  Gamma.
[21:42.420 --> 21:47.180]  And that has a very distinct smell
[21:47.180 --> 21:50.900]  and is attributed to like the Jack and XJ type smells.
[21:50.900 --> 21:53.420]  And a lot of times can be a very like overpowering note
[21:53.420 --> 21:56.940]  in like a lemon haze or a silver haze or something like that.
[21:57.940 --> 22:01.940]  Very, fairly common in like hybridized cannabis.
[22:01.940 --> 22:02.780]  A lot of sativas, yeah.
[22:02.780 --> 22:03.620]  Sativas.
[22:04.980 --> 22:05.820]  But very distinct.
[22:05.820 --> 22:06.660]  That works from the nine to one.
[22:06.660 --> 22:09.380]  Definitely, yeah, Dutch treat in there as well.
[22:09.380 --> 22:11.580]  You can really, that's I think like,
[22:11.580 --> 22:13.260]  if you're going to get into terp, terpenes,
[22:13.260 --> 22:14.660]  that's when you're going to be able to pick up
[22:14.660 --> 22:16.020]  more than most.
[22:16.020 --> 22:17.660]  Unless like most people are going to identify that
[22:17.660 --> 22:19.180]  because it stands a little different
[22:19.180 --> 22:20.460]  than most of the terpenes.
[22:20.460 --> 22:22.380]  Little bit less spicy, little bit more sweet.
[22:22.380 --> 22:23.220]  Okay.
[22:24.300 --> 22:25.140]  Very unique.
[22:25.140 --> 22:26.580]  So what's your favorite strain, bro?
[22:26.580 --> 22:27.420]  I'm glad you nailed it.
[22:28.100 --> 22:28.940]  I was going to let him hesitate for a second.
[22:28.940 --> 22:33.100]  I was really fixated on like that old school blueberry.
[22:33.100 --> 22:33.940]  Just that.
[22:33.940 --> 22:34.940]  We were talking about that last night.
[22:34.940 --> 22:36.580]  Yeah, that DJ short blueberry.
[22:36.580 --> 22:37.420]  DJ short style.
[22:37.420 --> 22:38.620]  And is that flower or dash?
[22:38.620 --> 22:39.460]  That's going to be flower.
[22:39.460 --> 22:40.900]  And then the dabs,
[22:40.900 --> 22:42.980]  we fell in love with this lemon strain we got
[22:42.980 --> 22:44.580]  that we call lemon grab.
[22:44.580 --> 22:46.820]  And we got, it was apparently, you know,
[22:46.820 --> 22:48.420]  just passed down through a number of people
[22:48.420 --> 22:52.340]  through the homey out at Orm Farms up in Seattle.
[22:52.340 --> 22:55.300]  And it was apparently some 20 year old lemon from Soma.
[22:55.300 --> 22:56.620]  And it is just a killer strain.
[22:56.660 --> 23:00.220]  It's just makes this like just intense lemon
[23:00.220 --> 23:02.340]  and it has none of the terpeneline taste.
[23:02.340 --> 23:04.220]  And it's a lot different than, you know,
[23:04.220 --> 23:07.020]  the common lemons I think we talked about yesterday.
[23:07.020 --> 23:09.740]  Much different than, no tangy notes.
[23:09.740 --> 23:14.740]  No, no, what was that lemon we were talking about?
[23:15.260 --> 23:16.100]  You guys?
[23:17.220 --> 23:18.060]  Aging orange.
[23:18.060 --> 23:18.900]  Death by lemons.
[23:18.900 --> 23:19.740]  Death by lemons, lemon Jeffrey.
[23:19.740 --> 23:20.580]  Nothing like that.
[23:20.580 --> 23:21.620]  Lemon G.
[23:21.620 --> 23:22.700]  Lemon, not lemon G.
[23:22.700 --> 23:24.060]  So it was really cool to have this sort of like
[23:24.060 --> 23:25.420]  unique lemon strain.
[23:25.460 --> 23:27.220]  And we had a nice harvest that we grew in house
[23:27.220 --> 23:29.140]  and made some amazing oil.
[23:29.140 --> 23:31.580]  So those are my favorite strains.
[23:31.580 --> 23:33.100]  Nice.
[23:33.100 --> 23:34.980]  It's all you, my friend.
[23:34.980 --> 23:35.900]  Heavy breather.
[23:35.900 --> 23:36.740]  Purple.
[23:36.740 --> 23:37.580]  Oh, sorry about that.
[23:37.580 --> 23:38.420]  No, it's good.
[23:38.420 --> 23:41.580]  I couldn't figure out who was doing it.
[23:41.580 --> 23:42.740]  Purple curse, just say it.
[23:42.740 --> 23:44.780]  Yeah, I mean a good perp, you know.
[23:44.780 --> 23:46.060]  Granddaddy perp for you?
[23:46.060 --> 23:46.900]  Granddaddy perp.
[23:46.900 --> 23:48.340]  Is that flower and dabbers?
[23:49.260 --> 23:50.420]  That's a flower, you know,
[23:50.420 --> 23:53.340]  just blunt swisher sweets at granddaddy perp.
[23:53.340 --> 23:54.180]  Call it a day.
[23:56.380 --> 23:59.020]  But you know, granddaddy perp's probably a favorite,
[23:59.020 --> 24:00.900]  but you know, mainly more, you know,
[24:00.900 --> 24:04.060]  I really love OG, a good OG.
[24:04.060 --> 24:07.220]  G-cut OG is my particular favorite cut of OG.
[24:07.220 --> 24:08.260]  God, it's almost like everyone,
[24:08.260 --> 24:09.100]  how can you hate OGs?
[24:09.100 --> 24:10.500]  I think everyone loves OGs so much.
[24:10.500 --> 24:11.460]  And you'd be like, what's your favorite?
[24:11.460 --> 24:13.740]  This guy's got a real fruity palate over here.
[24:13.740 --> 24:15.220]  Most of the room went for the OGs.
[24:15.220 --> 24:17.300]  Yeah, I would say the OGs and.
[24:17.300 --> 24:18.140]  Chems.
[24:18.140 --> 24:19.140]  Yeah, and definitely chem.
[24:19.140 --> 24:21.740]  I've been going really heavy on like some chem Ds
[24:21.740 --> 24:23.660]  and chem 91s lately.
[24:23.820 --> 24:25.540]  Really like those a lot as well.
[24:25.540 --> 24:28.860]  But yeah, mainly, you know, G-cut OG, flower, dab.
[24:30.180 --> 24:32.140]  I'll cook it up from time to time.
[24:32.140 --> 24:33.900]  Cookie, it's a unique thing.
[24:33.900 --> 24:34.740]  Yeah.
[24:34.740 --> 24:36.860]  I'll get burned out if there's too much cookies.
[24:36.860 --> 24:37.700]  Yeah.
[24:37.700 --> 24:39.020]  I'm over cookies, dude.
[24:39.020 --> 24:39.860]  I don't know, to me.
[24:39.860 --> 24:40.700]  I've been smoking a lot of Gorilla Glue lately.
[24:40.700 --> 24:42.940]  It doesn't have that distinct,
[24:42.940 --> 24:44.380]  you know, like a good Gorilla Glue, man.
[24:44.380 --> 24:46.460]  That's got like, you smell that with your eyes closed.
[24:46.460 --> 24:47.500]  You smell the different notes.
[24:47.500 --> 24:49.060]  It's got the distinct.
[24:49.060 --> 24:50.900]  Break it up and you get a little something different,
[24:50.900 --> 24:51.740]  you know?
[24:51.740 --> 24:53.180]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[24:53.700 --> 24:56.380]  And how have you guys compared the Gorilla Glue
[24:56.380 --> 24:58.660]  number fours with the S1s?
[24:58.660 --> 24:59.500]  Ooh.
[24:59.500 --> 25:01.940]  We have a couple packs of the S1s that we got
[25:01.940 --> 25:06.340]  from the homie, Unknown Profit out in California.
[25:06.340 --> 25:07.820]  We have not popped those just yet
[25:07.820 --> 25:09.700]  now that we've got this new warehouse firing off.
[25:09.700 --> 25:11.300]  I think we're going to check them out.
[25:11.300 --> 25:13.860]  And we have the cut of the GG4.
[25:15.180 --> 25:16.980]  So, you know, it'll be, it'll be,
[25:16.980 --> 25:19.340]  we'll be able to do a pretty nice little side by side.
[25:19.340 --> 25:20.180]  There we go.
[25:20.180 --> 25:21.020]  Comparison.
[25:21.020 --> 25:21.900]  Yeah, I've grown a ton of GG4,
[25:21.900 --> 25:23.900]  so I'll be able to recognize it a little bit.
[25:23.900 --> 25:25.380]  So we were talking about the Granddaddy Purple
[25:25.380 --> 25:26.740]  and I said, it's not my favorite.
[25:26.740 --> 25:28.580]  I'm going to kind of diss your strain here,
[25:28.580 --> 25:29.940]  but then I've got the two guys in the room
[25:29.940 --> 25:31.260]  that are going to be able to explain to me
[25:31.260 --> 25:32.780]  why I don't like it.
[25:32.780 --> 25:34.780]  When I smoke Granddaddy Purps, no matter,
[25:34.780 --> 25:37.060]  and it's a lot of purple buds do this to me.
[25:37.060 --> 25:38.380]  When they're dried and cured,
[25:38.380 --> 25:40.540]  they taste like they are still wet.
[25:40.540 --> 25:41.780]  Does that, have you experienced that?
[25:41.780 --> 25:42.620]  Or does that make sense to you?
[25:42.620 --> 25:45.060]  That it's, tastes like there's moisture in the bud
[25:45.060 --> 25:47.580]  or I don't like the flavor of Granddaddy Purps.
[25:48.420 --> 25:49.900]  Huh.
[25:49.900 --> 25:52.060]  The moisture content shouldn't be affected.
[25:52.060 --> 25:52.900]  Is this what you're not going to be growing it?
[25:52.900 --> 25:53.740]  Is this what you're not going to be growing it?
[25:53.740 --> 25:54.740]  Is this the moisture thing, like directly?
[25:54.740 --> 25:56.980]  No, I don't think it's actually moisture.
[25:56.980 --> 25:58.820]  It just tastes like wetness or tastes like moisture.
[25:58.820 --> 26:01.220]  It could be those sweet, those like sweet top notes.
[26:01.220 --> 26:03.420]  See a lot of these, like the Purps and like floral,
[26:03.420 --> 26:06.340]  these are got just different sort of like floral top notes,
[26:06.340 --> 26:08.900]  terpenoids, things that are like a little bit less
[26:08.900 --> 26:10.260]  like elucidated, I would think,
[26:10.260 --> 26:11.940]  and like the cannabis like sort of spectrum
[26:11.940 --> 26:13.460]  relative to like the symbol terpene.
[26:13.460 --> 26:16.620]  So, you know, you've got like a situation where,
[26:16.620 --> 26:19.060]  like how they age and how they oxidize
[26:19.060 --> 26:21.100]  is kind of dependent, right?
[26:21.100 --> 26:22.660]  And so you may get that effect.
[26:22.660 --> 26:24.420]  But some people might identify that,
[26:24.420 --> 26:27.380]  if it's like a frosh, fresh as fuck smelling, you know?
[26:27.380 --> 26:29.120]  And that's almost what it tastes like every time,
[26:29.120 --> 26:30.740]  even when it's dried and cured properly.
[26:30.740 --> 26:33.940]  You know, Granddaddy Purps is a fickle lady.
[26:33.940 --> 26:34.780]  You know what I mean?
[26:34.780 --> 26:37.700]  It's that real deal Urkel that I like.
[26:37.700 --> 26:38.620]  The purple Urkel?
[26:38.620 --> 26:41.660]  And as you know, you know, there's different phenos
[26:41.660 --> 26:43.180]  and cuts and whatnot.
[26:43.180 --> 26:44.620]  I feel like there's definitely one
[26:44.620 --> 26:48.140]  that's like a little bit heavier on like the cardboard terps.
[26:48.140 --> 26:49.820]  It smells like cardboard.
[26:49.820 --> 26:51.980]  Which may be kind of what you're talking about a little bit.
[26:51.980 --> 26:57.540]  It kind of smells like maybe it was cured in a brown paper bag
[26:57.540 --> 26:59.100]  and left in there a little bit too long.
[26:59.100 --> 27:00.860]  Yeah, it was a good kind of GDP as well.
[27:00.860 --> 27:02.100]  That being said, though, I don't know
[27:02.100 --> 27:04.860]  where you were getting a lot of your GDP from, but you know.
[27:04.860 --> 27:06.060]  True that.
[27:06.060 --> 27:07.460]  What? Well, I said true that.
[27:07.460 --> 27:09.340]  But yeah, it's all purple buds in my opinion.
[27:09.340 --> 27:10.580]  It's supposed to be the purple buds.
[27:10.580 --> 27:12.020]  Was this GDP you were growing or was this GDP?
[27:12.020 --> 27:14.260]  You know, I've never grown it because I've never been
[27:14.260 --> 27:15.420]  a fan since the beginning.
[27:15.420 --> 27:19.220]  GDP was a hugely mass produced drain out of California
[27:19.220 --> 27:22.660]  for quite some period of time and was one of the, you know,
[27:23.380 --> 27:25.780]  you know, was one of the earlier ones.
[27:25.780 --> 27:28.460]  High price, vanity style.
[27:28.460 --> 27:31.500]  Massive. Yeah. Massive commercial style grow warehouses
[27:31.500 --> 27:34.380]  where they're sending it across the country.
[27:34.380 --> 27:35.700]  Yeah. People wanted it all over.
[27:35.700 --> 27:38.660]  People wanted burps. People wanted allergies.
[27:38.660 --> 27:41.820]  It wasn't really part of the equation in those big, you know.
[27:41.820 --> 27:43.180]  Just get it out. Cross get it going.
[27:43.220 --> 27:44.180]  Just get it out.
[27:44.180 --> 27:46.180]  You guys can give me a good cut of the granddaddy perps.
[27:46.180 --> 27:48.300]  I'll grow the shit out of it. I'll trim it myself.
[27:48.300 --> 27:49.420]  I'll tell you, you'll like it.
[27:49.420 --> 27:50.620]  Super frosty.
[27:50.620 --> 27:52.620]  Granddaddy perp done right. I'm telling you.
[27:52.620 --> 27:54.380]  Anybody in Colorado or California.
[27:54.380 --> 27:55.780]  And the thing is too, we have purple leaves,
[27:55.780 --> 27:58.300]  not purple trichomes if I'm not mistaken, right?
[27:58.300 --> 27:59.540]  This isn't one of those.
[27:59.540 --> 28:02.100]  Yeah. A lot of people making these to get the different color
[28:03.020 --> 28:06.100]  bubble coming out and I'm pretty sure I'm mistaken.
[28:06.100 --> 28:08.620]  Those make mostly purple leaves, right?
[28:08.620 --> 28:11.100]  Not in the trichome. Do you have any?
[28:11.140 --> 28:13.940]  Yeah. I mean, granddaddy perp, depending on how it's done,
[28:13.940 --> 28:15.660]  you can have green grapes, you know?
[28:15.660 --> 28:17.740]  Yeah. Nice. Yeah. The black cherry.
[28:18.620 --> 28:20.060]  Sorry. Oh, go for it, bro. I talk a lot.
[28:20.060 --> 28:22.740]  I was going to say green grapes are my favorite.
[28:22.740 --> 28:25.100]  They have the purple leaves, but the green buds,
[28:25.100 --> 28:26.260]  you know what I'm saying? All right.
[28:26.260 --> 28:27.980]  The black cherry Kim is well known for its purple,
[28:27.980 --> 28:30.380]  but one of those green phenotypes is amazing.
[28:30.380 --> 28:32.980]  It's one of the keepers. Yeah. That's my only.
[28:32.980 --> 28:35.620]  And it's way out of the purple range is that black cherry Kim.
[28:35.620 --> 28:39.300]  It grows purple, but it doesn't taste like anything else purple.
[28:39.300 --> 28:42.420]  All right. I wanted to ask what happened to why
[28:42.420 --> 28:45.580]  did the original turpex Instagram get the kibosh?
[28:45.580 --> 28:47.180]  What happened there?
[28:48.740 --> 28:50.740]  What did you do? Haters going to hate, you know,
[28:50.740 --> 28:53.780]  the suits came in and said, it's time to clean it up.
[28:53.780 --> 28:55.940]  You know, you guys are you guys are going too hard
[28:55.940 --> 28:58.060]  and we're going to have to. How many followers was that?
[28:58.060 --> 29:01.060]  A little bit. How much is it? What do you have now?
[29:01.060 --> 29:03.020]  Fifteen hundred. Oh, how long?
[29:03.020 --> 29:07.300]  That's painful. A few weeks. Yeah, they should be down.
[29:07.300 --> 29:08.500]  They've been going hard on people.
[29:08.500 --> 29:09.900]  People don't even like really sell it.
[29:09.900 --> 29:11.380]  Yeah, we got DNA genetics.
[29:11.380 --> 29:14.180]  We even got so got so far as to get a hold of somebody over there.
[29:14.180 --> 29:17.300]  And they, you know, told us,
[29:17.300 --> 29:20.780]  can have certain information on there that we had on there.
[29:20.780 --> 29:22.940]  What information can you have information?
[29:22.940 --> 29:25.300]  Basically, any form of contact information.
[29:25.300 --> 29:27.540]  Oh, really? Any sort of pricing information?
[29:27.540 --> 29:31.460]  No pricing is a thing. And then no contact.
[29:31.460 --> 29:34.580]  I'm opening my Instagram right now to see if I've got contact info on there
[29:34.580 --> 29:36.460]  because they shut me down at 50.
[29:36.460 --> 29:40.820]  I was at 19 K and I'm at like 1500 and I feel dumb.
[29:40.820 --> 29:43.740]  Well, yeah. So let's make a song about that.
[29:43.740 --> 29:46.300]  Yeah, let's do it about Instagram.
[29:46.300 --> 29:49.260]  Stop trying to fuck you.
[29:49.260 --> 29:51.020]  Censor what we're putting out.
[29:58.440 --> 30:01.400]  But Gaji Instagram.
[30:04.120 --> 30:06.520]  Why do you suck?
[30:07.520 --> 30:14.040]  We just want to take nice pictures of weed and slaps.
[30:16.040 --> 30:20.040]  It's not so bad. I'm telling you.
[30:20.040 --> 30:24.040]  There's all kinds of people on your shit
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.040]  who are selling mean and Xanax on their pages.
[30:28.040 --> 30:33.040]  You should really be worried about them and not us.
[30:33.560 --> 30:37.040]  We just want to post pictures of cool,
[30:37.040 --> 30:40.040]  pickled weed and slaps.
[30:40.040 --> 30:41.560]  We kind of want to pour up.
[30:41.560 --> 30:45.040]  It's really not so bad.
[30:45.040 --> 30:49.040]  Why did you take our page away?
[30:49.040 --> 30:53.040]  Why did you take Jeff's page away?
[30:53.040 --> 30:54.040]  We took your page away.
[30:54.040 --> 30:57.040]  Please don't take my page away.
[30:57.040 --> 30:59.040]  I read genetics, Turbex Co.
[30:59.040 --> 31:01.040]  We really want our pages back.
[31:01.040 --> 31:09.040]  I wish Instagram would focus on all the people who are selling crack.
[31:09.040 --> 31:14.040]  DM me for info. I've got crack.
[31:14.040 --> 31:18.040]  DM me for info. I've got lean.
[31:18.040 --> 31:21.040]  DM me for info.
[31:21.040 --> 31:25.040]  I'll get you whatever you need.
[31:25.040 --> 31:27.040]  Promethazine.
[31:28.040 --> 31:30.040]  Yeah.
[31:30.040 --> 31:32.040]  Instagram.
[31:32.040 --> 31:37.040]  We're coming for you and we're not taking no for an answer.
[31:37.040 --> 31:43.040]  We will post pictures of our slaps and our glass and our weed.
[31:43.040 --> 31:45.040]  Fuck you indeed.
[31:45.040 --> 31:47.040]  Yeah.
[31:48.040 --> 31:55.040]  I just want to post freely.
[31:56.040 --> 31:58.040]  That was the Instagram song, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:58.040 --> 32:00.040]  Do you guys have a band name or are you just the Turpey Boys?
[32:00.040 --> 32:02.040]  We are Doc Butthole and the Brown Eyes.
[32:02.040 --> 32:04.040]  Doc Butthole and the Brown Eyes.
[32:04.040 --> 32:05.040]  That's a great segue.
[32:05.040 --> 32:08.040]  Now I think what has been demanded,
[32:08.040 --> 32:13.040]  Miss Damsel just walked by and wanted to hear the Butthole song.
[32:13.040 --> 32:16.040]  Is there such a thing as the Butthole song that happens between you two?
[32:16.040 --> 32:19.040]  Not necessarily the Butthole song.
[32:19.040 --> 32:24.040]  There's just kind of a variety, a multitude of multi-platinum tracks.
[32:24.040 --> 32:30.040]  What would it take to get you boys to riff a little bit of the Butthole riff here on the show for me?
[32:30.040 --> 32:33.040]  I think it would probably take those five buttholes that are downstairs.
[32:33.040 --> 32:35.040]  Yeah.
[32:35.040 --> 32:38.040]  And the truth comes.
[32:38.040 --> 32:42.040]  So we might have to pause real quick and come back once we get the whole crew up.
[32:42.040 --> 32:44.040]  Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[32:44.040 --> 32:46.040]  We'll be paused for a long time.
[32:46.040 --> 32:51.040]  Why don't you just start strumming a Butthole riff and we'll see if we can tempt this young man to sing some Butthole jams for us.
[32:52.040 --> 32:55.040]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, Butthole Jam Volume 1.
[32:55.040 --> 32:58.040]  Live on the Grow From Your Heart Podcast brought to you by Dan and Jordan.
[32:58.040 --> 33:00.040]  We are growing from our hearts right now.
[33:00.040 --> 33:01.040]  Remember, follow on my Instagram.
[33:01.040 --> 33:04.040]  This is what you guys tuned in for.
[33:04.040 --> 33:08.040]  Your life is less important than this song.
[33:08.040 --> 33:15.040]  Have you ever seen a cute little butthole?
[33:15.040 --> 33:17.040]  It's highly inappropriate.
[33:17.040 --> 33:29.040]  I know that you just wanted to maybe paint a picture of it.
[33:29.040 --> 33:37.400]  And maybe do some other things as well.
[33:37.400 --> 33:46.400]  Like putting your tongue in the butt.
[33:46.400 --> 33:54.400]  Yeah, you know that we like to lick lots of butthole.
[33:54.400 --> 33:56.400]  It tastes so good.
[33:56.400 --> 33:58.400]  It tastes so sweet.
[33:58.400 --> 34:05.400]  Tastes kind of like a coconut meat.
[34:05.400 --> 34:11.400]  Licking butthole tonight.
[34:11.400 --> 34:17.400]  Hey Jeff, when was the last time you ate butt?
[34:17.400 --> 34:21.400]  More recently than I care to admit.
[34:21.400 --> 34:34.400]  It's what a lucky guy to have those butthole terps for dinner every night.
[34:35.400 --> 34:47.400]  I'm sure she won't fight when you lick her butthole.
[34:47.400 --> 34:55.400]  It shines like a diamond when you're done, cause it's so damn clean.
[34:55.400 --> 35:03.400]  Licking butt is serene.
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.400]  If I don't lick it for a while I get mean.
[35:08.400 --> 35:10.400]  It gets green.
[35:10.400 --> 35:12.860]  It even lingers.
[35:12.860 --> 35:14.860]  Gotta blow off some steam.
[35:14.860 --> 35:16.860]  Keep it clean.
[35:16.860 --> 35:17.860]  Don't smoke blue dream.
[35:17.860 --> 35:20.860]  Keep it clean.
[35:20.860 --> 35:26.860]  You know my favorite strain is blue dream.
[35:26.860 --> 35:28.860]  Blue dream and some black wine.
[35:28.860 --> 35:30.860]  Fuck blue dream.
[35:30.860 --> 35:34.860]  Blue dream kinda tastes like a stripper's ass crack.
[35:34.860 --> 35:41.580]  I am pining.
[35:41.580 --> 35:45.580]  Strippers love blue dream.
[35:45.580 --> 35:49.580]  Strippers love blue dream.
[35:49.580 --> 35:54.580]  If there's one thing I know in my years in this game.
[35:54.580 --> 35:59.580]  Blue dream makes strippers go insane.
[35:59.580 --> 36:03.580]  Blue dream.
[36:03.580 --> 36:07.580]  Blue dream and some glitter on your butthole.
[36:07.580 --> 36:09.580]  Blue dream.
[36:09.580 --> 36:12.580]  That's how you know.
[36:12.580 --> 36:16.580]  You are smoking that stripper's delight.
[36:16.580 --> 36:17.580]  Blue dream.
[36:17.580 --> 36:18.580]  Pining.
[36:18.580 --> 36:19.580]  Blue dream.
[36:19.580 --> 36:21.580]  Pining on the butthole terps.
[36:21.580 --> 36:23.580]  I ain't blue dream.
[36:23.580 --> 36:27.580]  Pining on the butthole terps.
[36:27.580 --> 36:35.640]  Blue dream.
[36:35.640 --> 36:36.640]  Yeah.
[36:36.640 --> 36:37.640]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[36:37.640 --> 36:38.640]  You heard it here first.
[36:38.640 --> 36:39.640]  The butthole song.
[36:39.640 --> 36:41.640]  Segwayed into a little bit of blue dream.
[36:41.640 --> 36:45.640]  I haven't heard that performed in at least as long as I've been alive.
[36:45.640 --> 36:46.640]  Yeah.
[36:46.640 --> 36:48.640]  As long as he's been a part of R&B.
[36:48.640 --> 36:51.640]  I heard Jimmy played that back in 84.
[36:51.640 --> 36:52.640]  Fucking Jimmy man.
[36:52.640 --> 36:55.640]  Dude, fucking Jimmy fucking kills it man.
[36:55.640 --> 36:56.640]  Jimmy Garcia man.
[36:56.640 --> 36:57.640]  Yeah, I heard he's better than Trey.
[36:57.640 --> 36:59.640]  Way better man.
[36:59.640 --> 37:03.640]  Alright, so we've gone a long time and I want to reward my listeners.
[37:03.640 --> 37:05.640]  Everyone that's made it through the butthole song,
[37:05.640 --> 37:07.640]  that's made it through the shenanigans.
[37:07.640 --> 37:08.640]  Let's talk about Hash.
[37:08.640 --> 37:10.640]  We've got some amazing Hash artists here in the room.
[37:10.640 --> 37:11.640]  Everyone's nice and relaxed.
[37:11.640 --> 37:12.640]  We're all comfortable.
[37:12.640 --> 37:13.640]  We're all friends now.
[37:13.640 --> 37:15.640]  What's coming up with Hash?
[37:15.640 --> 37:16.640]  What's going to be next?
[37:16.640 --> 37:17.640]  We've got clear Hash.
[37:17.640 --> 37:18.640]  Terps.
[37:18.640 --> 37:19.640]  We've got dissolvable THC.
[37:19.640 --> 37:20.640]  Everyone wants the terps.
[37:20.640 --> 37:21.640]  We can put it in our Dr. Pepper.
[37:21.640 --> 37:22.640]  Terps, that's the truth.
[37:22.640 --> 37:23.640]  Everyone's talking terps.
[37:23.640 --> 37:24.640]  Everyone talks terps.
[37:24.640 --> 37:26.640]  They don't really even know what terps means.
[37:26.640 --> 37:27.640]  Yeah, most people don't know what a terp is.
[37:28.640 --> 37:29.640]  We're going to call it flavor components.
[37:29.640 --> 37:30.640]  The flavor is.
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.640]  And there's a lot going on with terpenes and a lot of different flavors.
[37:34.640 --> 37:35.640]  Terps.
[37:35.640 --> 37:36.640]  And I think, you know,
[37:36.640 --> 37:38.640]  I've got some people out there doing some little terpene isolates
[37:38.640 --> 37:40.640]  and stuff like that.
[37:40.640 --> 37:43.640]  But I think the game's going to be, you know,
[37:43.640 --> 37:45.640]  sort of just keeping the essence of cannabis so that everyone can
[37:45.640 --> 37:47.640]  experience it and all the different formulations.
[37:47.640 --> 37:50.640]  You know, it's like a kind of more of an art than cannabinoids.
[37:50.640 --> 37:52.640]  They're a little bit more stable.
[37:52.640 --> 37:54.640]  And flavors are kind of like an art.
[37:55.640 --> 37:57.640]  You know, perfumers and people who do that sort of extraction have been,
[37:57.640 --> 38:01.640]  you know, doing it for a long time and have a lot of their own methods.
[38:01.640 --> 38:06.640]  And I think cannabis hasn't quite matured to that level of science,
[38:06.640 --> 38:07.640]  and it's kind of getting there.
[38:07.640 --> 38:09.640]  We've just now been given the freedom.
[38:09.640 --> 38:13.640]  We were a little, we were prohibited from doing that experimentation.
[38:13.640 --> 38:14.640]  All right.
[38:14.640 --> 38:15.640]  So you feel like terps are next.
[38:15.640 --> 38:17.640]  You look like you've got something important to say.
[38:17.640 --> 38:19.640]  I was going to say, yeah, terps are good.
[38:19.640 --> 38:22.640]  We definitely have not been inhibited on doing that because those are all,
[38:22.640 --> 38:23.640]  those are all legal.
[38:23.640 --> 38:24.640]  Okay.
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.640]  And so some people have been doing some research on terpenes for a while.
[38:27.640 --> 38:31.640]  And with regard to, I mean, aromatherapy, that's,
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.640]  a lot of people poo-poo on that, but it's definitely real.
[38:35.640 --> 38:37.640]  And we, in the cannabis game,
[38:37.640 --> 38:40.640]  we see that that's real because it's one of the things that gets us high the
[38:40.640 --> 38:41.640]  way that we want to.
[38:41.640 --> 38:43.640]  And so then also, you know,
[38:43.640 --> 38:47.640]  you use it for people using lavender oil and stuff like that,
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.640]  just in the little, is it bedside steamers and stuff like that or whatever.
[38:52.640 --> 38:57.640]  The essential essence stuff, I mean, it's definitely real.
[38:57.640 --> 39:00.640]  And so incorporating that into cannabis is pretty cool. And yeah, keeping,
[39:00.640 --> 39:02.640]  keeping that original essence.
[39:02.640 --> 39:05.640]  And so coming up with the different extractions and trying to get just the
[39:05.640 --> 39:10.640]  terpenes and then get plants that produce a lot of terpenes.
[39:10.640 --> 39:11.640]  And there's a,
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.640]  there's pretty neat information out there and theories on how you can
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.640]  influence the terpene levels by soil management and like environmental
[39:19.640 --> 39:22.640]  controls and stuff like that. So there's, you know,
[39:22.640 --> 39:25.640]  this isn't the only industry where terpenes are prevalent or where people want
[39:25.640 --> 39:27.640]  the terpenes from what we're growing.
[39:27.640 --> 39:32.640]  And so there's a lot of literature around there about different,
[39:32.640 --> 39:34.640]  you know, lavender oil, like I said,
[39:34.640 --> 39:37.640]  is a big one or like rosehip oil or just all sorts of things.
[39:37.640 --> 39:41.640]  And they want to be able to extract those super efficiently.
[39:41.640 --> 39:42.640]  And so you can look at some of those,
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.640]  these other industries and follow their lead on how to better extract the,
[39:47.640 --> 39:52.640]  the stuff that you want and like an environmentally friendly and like easy
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.640]  way. So that's, that's definitely big. And that's going to be, like Chris said,
[39:56.640 --> 39:58.640]  a big part of the future. Probably.
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.640]  You said that environmental factors play a lot into my terpenoids and my soil.
[40:03.640 --> 40:04.640]  I know you're not,
[40:04.640 --> 40:07.640]  you're more on the hash side than you are the grow game from what I understand
[40:07.640 --> 40:08.640]  about you.
[40:08.640 --> 40:12.640]  Could you give myself and my listeners one hint on how we could improve our
[40:12.640 --> 40:13.640]  terps in our garden?
[40:13.640 --> 40:16.640]  One thing that we could just stop doing or start doing that would correct our
[40:16.640 --> 40:17.640]  terps.
[40:17.640 --> 40:19.640]  I've got that paper in the car and I haven't read it yet.
[40:19.640 --> 40:21.640]  I printed it out before I drove down here. Nice.
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.640]  Maybe, maybe the next podcast podcast. All right. Sounds good to me.
[40:25.640 --> 40:27.640]  You guys, you heard it here. He's going to read that and find out.
[40:28.640 --> 40:30.640]  You look like you got something to say, Jordan.
[40:30.640 --> 40:33.640]  Sup with Rosin bro. Sup with Rosin bro. Triple threat.
[40:33.640 --> 40:35.640]  A lot of my friends listen to this podcast.
[40:35.640 --> 40:38.640]  I've tasted one person's Rosin that I liked.
[40:38.640 --> 40:41.640]  Everything else tastes like burnt popcorn.
[40:41.640 --> 40:43.640]  I get a lot of the burnt popcorn. Yeah.
[40:43.640 --> 40:46.640]  I had one guy, my buddy Tim came through and he had some properly made Rosin.
[40:46.640 --> 40:49.640]  I think he made it himself. He was the only one who had Rosin that I liked.
[40:49.640 --> 40:54.640]  So how about that low temp, low temp, high pressure Rosin from bubble.
[40:54.640 --> 40:56.640]  Rosin from bubble. Okay.
[40:56.640 --> 40:59.640]  Get away from the plant matter. You don't want that shit.
[40:59.640 --> 41:01.640]  You don't want the cuticle waxes. You want what's in the heads anyway.
[41:01.640 --> 41:04.640]  Why are you pressing it through all the, all the, all the stuff.
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.640]  Even if you did like a half efficient dry sift or any kind of other sift,
[41:09.640 --> 41:12.640]  it gets you away from that bulk of the plant material.
[41:12.640 --> 41:15.640]  And that's going to increase your resin quality.
[41:15.640 --> 41:20.640]  You're going to get a lot less of the, of the resin stuck in the plant material.
[41:20.640 --> 41:22.640]  And overall, just going to be more of a pleasant experience.
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.640]  Just kind of come up with a reasonable sift, dry ice sift, or, you know,
[41:27.640 --> 41:29.640]  if you can keep the moisture away, you know,
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.640]  people are building out cold rooms doing, doing, going the full, the full length.
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.640]  And so if you can break that material down, get away from all that leaf,
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.640]  there it is. Okay. So, oh man, that's a lot of work for a home grower.
[41:41.640 --> 41:42.640]  Sometimes what's your,
[41:42.640 --> 41:45.640]  what's the most recommended way of getting some dry sift out of that to work
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.640]  it into Rosin. I mean, I think you can just kind of promptly break down.
[41:51.640 --> 41:53.640]  You know, they got road tap machines. Okay.
[41:53.640 --> 41:57.640]  They've got ways of sifting material that can, that are pretty efficient.
[41:57.640 --> 42:01.640]  If you just, you know, go about it the right way. Can I Rosin my Keefe? Yeah.
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.640]  Oh yeah. I see a bunch of head nod. All right. Done that. How'd that come out?
[42:05.640 --> 42:07.640]  Did it taste like burnt popcorn or since we didn't use plant matter,
[42:07.640 --> 42:10.640]  did it taste right? Uh, it tasted all right. Okay.
[42:10.640 --> 42:13.640]  I mean it definitely tastes better than what comes out of the flower.
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.640]  You know, shit in shit out as a classic and always the truth when it comes to
[42:18.640 --> 42:21.640]  any process. True. Very true. That's the truth of hash making.
[42:21.640 --> 42:24.640]  Consider that if it's Keefe and not like bubble or, you know, you don't know,
[42:24.640 --> 42:27.640]  you're just going to, eh, Keefe. Yeah. You'll get something out of it.
[42:27.640 --> 42:28.640]  But you know, you're,
[42:28.640 --> 42:32.640]  you run into that issue of like oxidation and plants just been through a lot.
[42:33.640 --> 42:35.640]  What should I be doing with my reclaim?
[42:35.640 --> 42:39.640]  I've got a dropdown that's probably got thrown it away. Just throw it away.
[42:39.640 --> 42:43.640]  I'll process that for you for six to $12 a gram.
[42:45.640 --> 42:47.640]  It's getting, you keep it. Don't throw anything out, you know,
[42:47.640 --> 42:49.640]  put it in your oven, put it in your oven, heat the shit out of it,
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.640]  make it into CBN. Okay. Make sleepy time, sleepy time, CBN, heat it up,
[42:53.640 --> 42:56.640]  make it in and then just dab it again or make edibles with it.
[42:56.640 --> 42:58.640]  Dab it, eat it, do whatever. Dab it or eat it. All right.
[42:58.640 --> 43:01.640]  Who knows? Dab, dabbing it a lot. I have very little psychoactivity,
[43:01.640 --> 43:04.640]  but you'll probably find a calming sleepy time effect from it.
[43:04.640 --> 43:06.640]  We've got a, I've got a video going and they said,
[43:06.640 --> 43:11.640]  can we season our nails with reclaim? Yeah. Yeah. Why couldn't you, bro?
[43:11.640 --> 43:12.640]  Yeah, you totally could season that nail.
[43:13.640 --> 43:15.640]  If you're kind of like upset with your buddy, you know,
[43:15.640 --> 43:18.640]  take some of his like oil and just kind of use it to like clean it and,
[43:18.640 --> 43:21.640]  you know, make, make a new nail and he brings the flame.
[43:21.640 --> 43:26.640]  It's got boo-boo when he's not looking, tossing on boom.
[43:27.640 --> 43:30.640]  One thing, one thing I've seen recently regarding to the Rosin thing,
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.640]  just jump back to that. I saw a picture on the internet the other day of
[43:34.640 --> 43:36.640]  someone who had smashed their fingers. I saw that.
[43:36.640 --> 43:39.640]  The pneumatic was a girl because there's girl fingernails on the, you know,
[43:39.640 --> 43:44.640]  they were trying to press Rosin and one of those super, super low, you know,
[43:44.640 --> 43:48.640]  low temp, high pressure situations and didn't get their fingers out of the way.
[43:48.640 --> 43:53.640]  And it was not a pretty sight. It looked like you ran over a banana.
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.640]  Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was terrible. It looked like you microwaved a hot dog.
[43:58.640 --> 44:01.640]  It was just, yeah, that was a mess. Be careful. Rosin and hold out there kids.
[44:01.640 --> 44:04.640]  Yeah. Most of you guys are using, you stole your girlfriend's hair straightener.
[44:04.640 --> 44:06.640]  They're not using a hydraulic press or anything.
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.640]  To be fair that as goofy and stupid as it works is pretty damn good.
[44:11.640 --> 44:13.640]  Yeah. I've got no hatred on the cup off.
[44:13.640 --> 44:18.640]  Honestly, the best Rosin I've tried was from actually flour and a hair straightener.
[44:18.640 --> 44:21.640]  It was the first time we tried it. What was that from the Gorilla Glue?
[44:22.640 --> 44:24.640]  I don't remember. I think it was too.
[44:25.640 --> 44:27.640]  I don't remember your Rosin virginity. Unfortunately.
[44:27.640 --> 44:29.640]  I think the thing we're going to run into too,
[44:29.640 --> 44:33.640]  just like any of these other extracts is that with some plants will be better
[44:33.640 --> 44:36.640]  suited for terpene extraction. Some plants will be better for like BHO.
[44:36.640 --> 44:38.640]  Some plants will be better for Rosin.
[44:38.640 --> 44:41.640]  You get to certain heats and tension with certain terpenes and no bueno and
[44:41.640 --> 44:45.640]  certain ones are fine. So I think it's a matter of like, where do these,
[44:46.640 --> 44:49.640]  if it's all going towards oil, then there's five or six ways to make oil.
[44:49.640 --> 44:53.640]  And that's going to leave different spectrums of which plants get turned in.
[44:53.640 --> 44:57.640]  The GDP, maybe it gets pressed and doesn't taste like so. Right.
[44:57.640 --> 45:01.640]  So whatever, or maybe it's like you really taste better when you get it first.
[45:02.640 --> 45:04.640]  All open possibilities. I like the way you think my friend.
[45:05.640 --> 45:08.640]  Yeah. We got to get some GDP and press it and then blast it and then make
[45:08.640 --> 45:11.640]  bubble out of it and see if we can convince me that I like that flavor.
[45:11.640 --> 45:14.640]  I think you're going to love it. I think it's best in flower farm though.
[45:14.640 --> 45:17.640]  All right, well let's get it. I'll grow it. We'll smoke it. Me too.
[45:18.640 --> 45:20.640]  Me too. All of us. We're in agreeance with that.
[45:20.640 --> 45:23.640]  Just call me on over. Call me over. Awesome. All right.
[45:24.640 --> 45:25.640]  So we've been going for a long time.
[45:25.640 --> 45:27.640]  Our listeners have probably checked out around the butthole song.
[45:27.640 --> 45:29.640]  So I hope a lot of people enjoyed that extra bonus hash talk.
[45:30.640 --> 45:31.640]  If you're paying attention, that's your bonus.
[45:32.640 --> 45:33.640]  That's a big shout out to you because these guys are,
[45:34.640 --> 45:36.640]  I've got some of the hash mad scientists,
[45:37.640 --> 45:40.640]  the forefront hash guys in the room here. I wish I would've been more prepared,
[45:40.640 --> 45:41.640]  but I had no idea these guys were even going to be here.
[45:42.640 --> 45:43.640]  So this is pretty awesome. Thanks for being on the show. You guys.
[45:44.640 --> 45:46.640]  Thanks for sharing the hash wisdom. Thank you.
[45:47.640 --> 45:48.640]  Chris looks like he's got more stuff brewing up.
[45:49.640 --> 45:51.640]  If you've got more knowledge you want to drop on these listeners, bro,
[45:52.640 --> 45:53.640]  I will never stop. You will put a spotlight on.
[45:54.640 --> 45:55.640]  He will give you a microphone.
[45:56.640 --> 45:59.640]  Any term knowledge, various physical and metaphysical, uh,
[46:00.640 --> 46:03.640]  phenomenon physics and science. Oh yeah. If we go too far deep, you know,
[46:04.640 --> 46:05.640]  there's no getting out. Some minds will be blown.
[46:06.640 --> 46:08.640]  There'll be, you know, it'll appear to be crime scenes across the world.
[46:09.640 --> 46:11.640]  People's phones will start rupturing and such. Yeah.
[46:12.640 --> 46:13.640]  I hear you. Make sure you're in a steel room.
[46:13.640 --> 46:15.640]  Paraday caged. Yeah, it was bad things happen.
[46:16.640 --> 46:18.640]  Let's get away from that for now. All right.
[46:19.640 --> 46:20.640]  So I think it's time to wrap up the show.
[46:21.640 --> 46:22.640]  Would you guys like to wrap us up with another song?
[46:23.640 --> 46:25.640]  Would that be possible? Got a topic for us, Jeff?
[46:26.640 --> 46:27.640]  Oh, let's just do some, uh,
[46:28.640 --> 46:30.640]  some dab talk and some growing from your heart and maybe talk about boobs a
[46:31.640 --> 46:32.640]  little. All right. All right.
[46:33.640 --> 46:34.640]  While you guys start the riff and I'm going to say,
[46:35.640 --> 46:36.640]  thanks everybody for joining me. I appreciate everybody for being on the
[46:37.640 --> 46:38.640]  podcast. You guys on Periscope. I'm going to close the video.
[46:39.640 --> 46:40.640]  Thank you for watching. Oh, you know what?
[46:41.640 --> 46:42.640]  Let's just leave it on so you guys can hear the song.
[46:43.640 --> 46:45.640]  You can hear a song. Uh, thanks for watching on Periscope.
[46:46.640 --> 46:48.640]  Dude. Thank you for joining me. Playing guitar fist bump, bro.
[46:49.640 --> 46:51.640]  Before you get going, mental fist bump from across the room.
[46:52.640 --> 46:53.640]  Thanks for joining me. Follow the clear scientist.
[46:54.640 --> 46:55.640]  Made a new friend in Brian tonight. Learned a lot of great shit from me
[46:56.640 --> 46:57.640]  already. Cannot wait to try the mother's milk.
[46:58.640 --> 47:01.640]  Mother's milk. Water soluble THC that won't taste like anything.
[47:02.640 --> 47:03.640]  You can just cause you high all day. Yeah.
[47:04.640 --> 47:05.640]  I could use an app sometimes. Then of course, Jordan,
[47:06.640 --> 47:07.640]  thanks for coming on the show and singing. Anytime.
[47:08.640 --> 47:11.640]  You're my favorite choir boy. Hey, gotta, gotta, you know,
[47:11.640 --> 47:15.640]  take what the Lord gave you. I appreciate each and every one of you.
[47:16.640 --> 47:18.640]  Which Lord is that? The Jewish one. The Jewish one. Yeah.
[47:19.640 --> 47:21.640]  I wasn't going to go there. Thank you. So I'll be back.
[47:22.640 --> 47:23.640]  I'm going to let these guys sing a little song when they wrap it up.
[47:24.640 --> 47:26.640]  I will be back to wrap up the show and say goodbye in the official way.
[47:27.640 --> 47:29.640]  I'm going to set my microphone down and take a dab and enjoy the song.
[47:30.640 --> 47:31.640]  You guys. Thanks for listening. Thanks for having us, man.
[47:32.640 --> 47:33.640]  Oh dude. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the hash knowledge.
[47:34.640 --> 47:37.640]  I want you guys back soon. Enjoy the song guys.
[47:41.640 --> 47:46.640]  We are growing from our hearts.
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.640]  We are growing from our hearts.
[47:53.640 --> 47:56.640]  Rasta Jeff.
[47:57.640 --> 48:01.640]  His dreads are as long as I'm tall.
[48:04.640 --> 48:07.640]  And he takes lots of dabs.
[48:08.640 --> 48:11.640]  Rasta Jeff.
[48:12.640 --> 48:15.640]  He is growing turps for
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.640]  the green and healthy shop these days.
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.640]  While Cocker Daniel plays guitar.
[48:29.640 --> 48:37.120]  I need a dab.
[48:38.120 --> 48:40.120]  I need a dab.
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.120]  So big and strong.
[48:44.120 --> 48:47.120]  Out of my bong.
[48:48.120 --> 48:53.120]  Jeff wanted me to sing about boobs.
[48:56.120 --> 48:59.120]  Those are my favorite things.
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.120]  There's about ten hot titties sitting
[49:06.120 --> 49:09.120]  in this house.
[49:10.120 --> 49:16.710]  But unfortunately they won't let me take off their blouse.
[49:17.710 --> 49:24.130]  They're kind of mean.
[49:27.130 --> 49:33.790]  But they still have nice titties.
[49:35.790 --> 49:40.790]  We gotta grow from our hearts.
[49:42.790 --> 49:48.470]  Grow from your heart.
[49:49.470 --> 49:51.470]  Grow from your heart.
[49:52.470 --> 49:55.470]  Grow from your heart.

[50:14.470 --> 50:17.470]  Ripping farts.
[50:20.470 --> 50:23.470]  Growing from our hearts.

[52:05.630 --> 52:07.230]  I had like 19,000 followers.
[52:07.230 --> 52:08.710]  I woke up one day.
[52:08.730 --> 52:10.210]  And I did not have an account anymore.

[54:14.350 --> 54:17.350]  You know, for oxyzole, a general issue.
[54:17.350 --> 54:19.350]  We know.
[54:19.350 --> 54:20.350]  Jobby, but I'm a ball.
[54:20.350 --> 54:23.350]  So I'm tired of mediocre evil.
[54:23.350 --> 54:25.350]  I go fall when we're trying to know.
[54:25.350 --> 54:27.350]  Even from down, call them life.
