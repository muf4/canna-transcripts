[00:18.170 --> 00:20.650]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.650 --> 00:24.050]  It's time for episode number 117 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.210 --> 00:27.570]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.450 --> 00:28.770]  That's right.
[00:28.770 --> 00:31.250]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[00:31.250 --> 00:34.850]  new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even
[00:34.850 --> 00:38.050]  someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this,
[00:38.050 --> 00:39.930]  my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:41.050 --> 00:41.650]  I'm your host.
[00:41.710 --> 00:42.930]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:42.970 --> 00:44.450]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.810 --> 00:47.530]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the
[00:47.530 --> 00:50.050]  Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:50.570 --> 00:53.610]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.450 --> 00:57.650]  I hope you guys are having a great morning, great afternoon, great
[00:57.650 --> 00:59.890]  nighttime, great evening, whatever time it is, wherever you are.
[01:00.250 --> 01:01.610]  I hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[01:01.810 --> 01:03.090]  Maybe you're taking a dab with me.
[01:03.610 --> 01:05.530]  Maybe you've got a big old fat blunt with a half a gram of
[01:05.530 --> 01:06.610]  wax down the middle of it.
[01:07.130 --> 01:09.190]  Maybe you got your girlfriend's hair straightened her out and you're making
[01:09.190 --> 01:12.050]  some razz in a dabbing that tonight, whatever you're doing, I hope
[01:12.050 --> 01:12.970]  you're getting lit up with me.
[01:13.010 --> 01:15.170]  You guys, I'm sitting here hitting the Hitman short stack.
[01:15.170 --> 01:16.970]  Big shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[01:17.330 --> 01:20.250]  You know me when I buy a new rig, I like to buy a rig made in America by
[01:20.250 --> 01:22.130]  Americans that dab as hard as we do.
[01:22.330 --> 01:24.050]  That's why I buy Hitman Glass.
[01:24.210 --> 01:26.050]  Hitman Glass made in Southern California.
[01:26.210 --> 01:28.490]  Make sure you guys support hitmanglass.com.
[01:28.810 --> 01:31.050]  Also make sure you follow my friend Dougie on Instagram.
[01:31.050 --> 01:35.130]  It's at hitmanglassdougie, at hitmanglassdougie on Instagram.
[01:35.170 --> 01:38.050]  Follow him, let him know you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and
[01:38.050 --> 01:39.970]  that you heard about Hitman through the show.
[01:40.170 --> 01:41.090]  I would appreciate that.
[01:41.090 --> 01:41.850]  So would Dougie.
[01:42.570 --> 01:44.250]  You guys, I'm also dabbing on the email.
[01:44.250 --> 01:46.970]  I got the email with the dropdown on the Hitman rig.
[01:47.290 --> 01:50.530]  I've got a replacement coil, so I need to give a big shout out to my buddy, Jason.
[01:50.530 --> 01:53.610]  Big shout out to Mott Extractions and Gaia Edibles.
[01:54.050 --> 01:55.530]  My friends came through and paid me a visit.
[01:55.530 --> 01:56.690]  They laced me up properly.
[01:56.730 --> 01:57.730]  I appreciate you guys.
[01:57.930 --> 01:58.690]  Thanks for the help.
[01:58.970 --> 01:59.850]  Life is terpy.
[02:00.650 --> 02:02.730]  I think that's all the shout outs I got for you today, you guys.
[02:03.090 --> 02:07.690]  On this episode, this is the episode where I have the lovely Miss Charlotte Green.
[02:07.690 --> 02:09.570]  We'll drop that in here just a little bit.
[02:09.890 --> 02:13.610]  I went to the Denver Patient Support Group in Denver at a place called
[02:13.610 --> 02:17.890]  Castleman's and I was granted a 10 minute interview with the lovely Charlotte Green.
[02:17.890 --> 02:19.370]  So I'll play that here in just a few minutes.
[02:19.890 --> 02:22.410]  Before I get to that, I want to read a news article.
[02:22.410 --> 02:23.210]  Let me turn down the music.
[02:24.810 --> 02:30.050]  This article actually comes from the extract suntimes.com.
[02:30.050 --> 02:31.650]  I found this on the internet, of course.
[02:32.090 --> 02:36.370]  Uh, lately, uh, there have been some revelations made in the cannabis industry.
[02:36.370 --> 02:39.650]  If you've got a commercial grow or a private grow, you may want to hear this.
[02:39.650 --> 02:42.610]  If you're using a product called Guardian, you need to get that
[02:42.610 --> 02:45.690]  stuff out of your garden, out of your place, just get rid of it.
[02:46.130 --> 02:47.890]  It is not something you want to be spraying.
[02:47.890 --> 02:49.090]  So let's get right into the article here.
[02:49.090 --> 02:51.090]  I'm looking for an author here.
[02:51.090 --> 02:54.170]  It says written by Emily Gray Brocious.
[02:54.370 --> 02:54.650]  All right.
[02:54.770 --> 02:58.570]  So this article was posted on January 21st and it goes like this.
[02:59.050 --> 03:02.410]  A popular pesticide approved last week by Oregon health officials for use on
[03:02.410 --> 03:05.890]  cannabis plants has now been removed from the list of acceptable marijuana
[03:05.890 --> 03:09.770]  pesticides due to detection of a controversial chemical ingredient,
[03:09.770 --> 03:11.450]  as reported by the Oregonian.
[03:11.970 --> 03:14.330]  And guys, this is an article from Oregon, but soon you will
[03:14.330 --> 03:15.610]  see how this applies to you.
[03:16.130 --> 03:21.370]  A marijuana testing lab in Eugene found traces of the chemical abamectin in
[03:21.370 --> 03:24.650]  supposedly organically grown cannabis and discovered growers had been using
[03:24.650 --> 03:26.970]  a pesticide called Guardian mite spray.
[03:27.530 --> 03:31.210]  Guardian mite spray includes natural ingredients such as lemon oil and
[03:31.210 --> 03:36.250]  cinnamon among its active ingredients and is marketed as an all natural product.
[03:36.890 --> 03:40.610]  Abamectin was not listed as an active ingredient on the product label.
[03:41.010 --> 03:44.050]  The pesticide has become widely popular because it's more effective
[03:44.050 --> 03:45.450]  than any harsh chemicals.
[03:45.490 --> 03:48.730]  Neil Bernstein, owner of roots garden supply told the Oregonian.
[03:49.370 --> 03:50.770]  Of course it's more effective.
[03:50.770 --> 03:51.850]  They're lying in their shit.
[03:51.850 --> 03:53.130]  And they didn't tell you about.
[03:54.010 --> 03:54.930]  I'll continue to read.
[03:55.290 --> 03:59.090]  Uh, Oregon's department of agriculture has temporarily removed the product from
[03:59.090 --> 04:02.690]  its list of approved cannabis pesticides until further investigation can be
[04:02.690 --> 04:03.370]  conducted.
[04:03.490 --> 04:06.490]  Abamectin is commonly used in fruit and vegetable production, but those
[04:06.490 --> 04:10.570]  produce items are not marketed or sold as organic according to green rush daily.
[04:10.930 --> 04:15.050]  Detection of this chemical and allegedly organic marijuana is problematic because
[04:15.050 --> 04:19.170]  people often pay a higher premium for organically grown cannabis, especially
[04:19.170 --> 04:21.050]  medical marijuana patients.
[04:21.650 --> 04:26.010]  So this company was putting out a pesticide and they were having great
[04:26.010 --> 04:26.650]  success with it.
[04:26.650 --> 04:30.610]  It was taking down all of the problems, but they were not listing the abamectin
[04:30.610 --> 04:34.690]  on the label, which is not an organic compound or chemical.
[04:34.970 --> 04:36.410]  And it was clearly in the product.
[04:36.890 --> 04:41.130]  So there may be, if this was, if this was a rule in Colorado, if this product
[04:41.130 --> 04:45.410]  was banned in Colorado and this was applied to a crop in Colorado and a lab
[04:45.410 --> 04:49.210]  found this, that crop would be recalled and none of the products made with the
[04:49.210 --> 04:52.810]  trim or the buds of that crop would be allowed to be sold in a dispensary.
[04:53.090 --> 04:54.850]  The product would all have to be destroyed.
[04:55.130 --> 04:56.450]  People would lose a lot of money.
[04:58.210 --> 05:02.130]  I hope the people for guardian are held accountable when that time comes.
[05:02.690 --> 05:05.810]  Uh, it's a gray area because cannabis is federally illegal.
[05:05.810 --> 05:08.970]  I don't know if we can sue for that, but if crops have to be thrown away
[05:08.970 --> 05:12.930]  because guardian was applied and there was a, an ingredient not listed on the
[05:12.930 --> 05:16.130]  label, I hope the folks from guardian can be held accountable for that.
[05:17.010 --> 05:19.930]  Um, I have posted to Facebook that I'm trying to get in touch
[05:19.930 --> 05:21.130]  with the people from guardian.
[05:21.370 --> 05:22.570]  Their website is gone.
[05:22.930 --> 05:26.330]  The distributors and vendors that I was aware of for guardian have disappeared.
[05:26.650 --> 05:27.610]  I cannot find them.
[05:27.610 --> 05:30.970]  If you work for guardian or you were a part of guardian might spray, and you'd
[05:30.970 --> 05:35.410]  like to talk to me on behalf of guardian on the show and tell us what's up, why
[05:35.410 --> 05:36.810]  that shit wasn't listed on there.
[05:36.810 --> 05:40.210]  Or if you have something to say, uh, I will give you time on the podcast.
[05:40.210 --> 05:41.450]  All you have to do is contact me.
[05:41.450 --> 05:43.850]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[05:43.850 --> 05:44.650]  It's very easy.
[05:45.170 --> 05:47.250]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[05:47.250 --> 05:49.010]  That's an open invitation to come be on the show.
[05:49.370 --> 05:50.570]  Let us know what's going on with this.
[05:51.050 --> 05:52.130]  You don't even have to come to me.
[05:52.170 --> 05:52.970]  I can come to you.
[05:52.970 --> 05:54.690]  I've got portable podcasting equipment.
[05:54.690 --> 05:55.690]  We can do it over Skype.
[05:55.690 --> 05:56.970]  We can do it over FaceTime.
[05:57.210 --> 05:58.810]  We can do it through a simple phone call.
[05:59.050 --> 06:00.690]  However you guys would like to be on the show.
[06:00.690 --> 06:02.010]  This is an open invitation.
[06:02.770 --> 06:06.210]  I would like to know why that was not listed on the label of your product.
[06:06.210 --> 06:08.330]  I'm sure you knew it was in there because you had to pay for it
[06:08.330 --> 06:09.370]  to put it in the product.
[06:09.970 --> 06:10.210]  All right.
[06:10.210 --> 06:14.210]  And if anybody else has guardian in their garden or in your garden pantry
[06:14.210 --> 06:16.290]  area, properly dispose of that.
[06:16.890 --> 06:20.010]  I honestly do not know the proper procedure for disposing of a bottle of
[06:20.010 --> 06:23.250]  pesticides, but please do some research and get rid of that stuff.
[06:23.250 --> 06:27.530]  If you've already applied guardian to your personal crop, you should be okay.
[06:28.010 --> 06:29.650]  Uh, it's not organic anymore.
[06:29.650 --> 06:30.770]  You can't say it was organic.
[06:30.770 --> 06:31.930]  It's not going to kill you.
[06:32.170 --> 06:36.330]  And if you've got a commercial crop and you've applied guardian in Colorado, I
[06:36.330 --> 06:40.330]  hope you pass all of the testing when it comes up, you guys, if you're thinking
[06:40.330 --> 06:43.810]  about making a product for the cannabis community, think longterm, uh, these
[06:43.810 --> 06:45.050]  guys weren't around very long.
[06:45.450 --> 06:47.930]  Uh, if they would have made a product that worked and put some thought into
[06:47.930 --> 06:50.170]  it and put some heart into it, they'd still be part of the community.
[06:50.170 --> 06:51.650]  We'd still be giving them our money.
[06:51.970 --> 06:56.370]  Instead, they tried to pull some shit on us and now they have to hide.
[06:56.490 --> 06:57.930]  They're shunned from the cannabis community.
[06:57.930 --> 06:59.970]  No, one's ever going to trust these people again, whoever they are.
[07:00.010 --> 07:02.490]  If you know who they are, you're never going to buy a product from them again.
[07:02.490 --> 07:04.250]  If you're a sales rep from that company, people are going to
[07:04.250 --> 07:05.450]  have a hard time trusting you.
[07:06.170 --> 07:08.450]  The legal cannabis industry is just getting started.
[07:08.770 --> 07:12.930]  And if you're part of this evolution of the cannabis industry, before it goes
[07:12.930 --> 07:16.450]  nationwide, you would have the opportunity to be in a huge business.
[07:16.450 --> 07:18.650]  But instead of these guys pretty much just got blackballed.
[07:18.650 --> 07:22.210]  So don't be these guys grow from your heart, be a good person.
[07:22.730 --> 07:26.250]  All right, guys, I am going to time warp us back a few days and we're going to go
[07:26.290 --> 07:31.530]  to Denver, Colorado to Castleman's where we had the Denver patient support group
[07:31.530 --> 07:32.970]  with our lovely speaker, Ms.
[07:32.970 --> 07:33.850]  Charlo Green.
[07:34.250 --> 07:36.210]  Uh, this was a very great interview.
[07:36.450 --> 07:39.650]  This was the first interview I've ever had where the person I was interviewing
[07:39.650 --> 07:41.490]  had an assistant who was keeping time.
[07:41.810 --> 07:43.450]  Uh, she told me you have 10 minutes.
[07:43.730 --> 07:46.210]  When the interview started, she put her hands up and showed me 10 minutes.
[07:46.210 --> 07:48.090]  When nine minutes happened, she showed me nine.
[07:48.530 --> 07:50.730]  Uh, when five minutes came around, she showed me the five.
[07:50.730 --> 07:52.370]  When three minutes came up, I got the three.
[07:52.810 --> 07:54.450]  About one minute, she kind of gave me the look.
[07:54.530 --> 07:56.090]  So I knew it was time to wrap up the interview.
[07:56.450 --> 07:56.730]  Uh, Ms.
[07:56.730 --> 08:00.730]  Charlo was on a tight schedule, so I do appreciate her for taking a 10 minute
[08:00.730 --> 08:02.490]  chunk out of her night to do an interview with me.
[08:02.810 --> 08:03.970]  So you guys, here we go.
[08:03.970 --> 08:05.050]  Let's spin back in time.
[08:05.210 --> 08:07.810]  We're going to Castleman's in Denver and ladies and gentlemen,
[08:07.810 --> 08:09.130]  Rasta Jeff and Charlo Green.
[08:22.400 --> 08:22.600]  All right.
[08:22.600 --> 08:23.720]  Welcome back podcast listeners.
[08:23.720 --> 08:26.920]  I'm here at the Denver cannabis patient support group at Castleman's in Denver,
[08:26.920 --> 08:29.880]  and I am joined on mic by the lovely Charlo Green.
[08:29.920 --> 08:30.760]  Thank you for joining me.
[08:30.800 --> 08:31.920]  Thank you for having me, Jeff.
[08:32.000 --> 08:32.760]  Uh, this is a great event.
[08:32.760 --> 08:33.680]  There are a lot of people here already.
[08:33.680 --> 08:35.520]  It's kind of early and we still are already getting people.
[08:35.560 --> 08:35.920]  Right.
[08:35.920 --> 08:36.680]  We're filling up.
[08:36.680 --> 08:40.120]  I think this shows just how excited people are for this opportunity to
[08:40.120 --> 08:42.800]  share their own experiences and learn.
[08:43.040 --> 08:47.440]  I mean, now that you guys have passed that barrier that most of the rest of us
[08:47.440 --> 08:50.920]  are fighting for, we're all watching to see what you do and the fact that so
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.800]  many people are taking initiative to educate themselves, it's encouraging.
[08:55.000 --> 08:55.560]  Education.
[08:55.560 --> 08:56.360]  That's the key here tonight.
[08:56.360 --> 08:56.680]  Isn't it?
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.480]  I see a lot of vendors here.
[08:58.480 --> 09:00.040]  Everybody has their educational info.
[09:00.040 --> 09:01.920]  It's not like they're here doing a swap meet, trying to sell.
[09:01.920 --> 09:03.400]  I love the vibe that people have brought.
[09:03.800 --> 09:06.240]  It's more of an educational and not give me your money, which is
[09:06.400 --> 09:07.640]  what we've needed in this industry.
[09:07.680 --> 09:08.280]  I appreciate it.
[09:08.280 --> 09:08.600]  Exactly.
[09:08.640 --> 09:09.160]  Exactly.
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.120]  It's a service.
[09:10.160 --> 09:10.960]  That's what this is.
[09:10.960 --> 09:11.200]  It is.
[09:11.200 --> 09:12.040]  It's not a trade show.
[09:12.040 --> 09:12.760]  It's not a fair.
[09:12.800 --> 09:13.560]  So I appreciate it.
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.600]  Thank you for doing that for us.
[09:15.040 --> 09:16.760]  It seems like every time we have an event like this, they're just
[09:16.760 --> 09:18.160]  trying to pull money out of our pockets.
[09:19.320 --> 09:20.280]  Have you noticed that?
[09:20.280 --> 09:21.320]  I've kind of noticed that.
[09:21.320 --> 09:21.680]  Yeah.
[09:21.680 --> 09:22.600]  We've forgotten what it's all about.
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.920]  We've forgotten medical marijuana.
[09:23.920 --> 09:25.200]  We've gone all recreational.
[09:25.280 --> 09:25.880]  Exactly.
[09:25.880 --> 09:26.480]  About the patient.
[09:26.480 --> 09:26.960]  So thank you.
[09:26.960 --> 09:28.080]  Uh, I'm a patient myself.
[09:28.080 --> 09:30.400]  So on behalf of all of the Colorado patients, thanks for coming.
[09:30.640 --> 09:33.600]  Well, I am thrilled to be co-hosting with Dr.
[09:33.600 --> 09:39.200]  Michelle Ross, who also sits on the board of advisors for MD herb, which
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.880]  is a medical marijuana resource.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.240]  Make sure you guys Google that right now.
[09:42.240 --> 09:42.960]  Do they have a website?
[09:43.120 --> 09:43.440]  Yeah.
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.880]  M D herb.org.
[09:45.920 --> 09:46.400]  There you go guys.
[09:46.400 --> 09:46.960]  Check that out.
[09:46.960 --> 09:47.480]  Support that.
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.280]  It's a good cause.
[09:48.680 --> 09:52.720]  Uh, so, um, you're kind of well known for your fuck it.
[09:52.720 --> 09:54.120]  I quit statement on the news.
[09:54.160 --> 09:54.640]  Yes.
[09:54.680 --> 09:57.480]  Um, a lot of my listeners might not be familiar with who you are.
[09:57.640 --> 10:01.600]  Can you give us maybe a brief, uh, history lesson up to today?
[10:01.600 --> 10:02.680]  And then we'll talk about the event.
[10:02.880 --> 10:03.360]  Sure.
[10:03.720 --> 10:06.880]  I was working as a news anchor in Anchorage, Alaska.
[10:07.160 --> 10:10.560]  I became the cannabis reporter and I learned about the true hand of
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.960]  harm surrounding cannabis prohibition.
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.440]  I was able to meet the patients that were being affected by our
[10:17.440 --> 10:19.280]  broken medical marijuana system.
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.880]  And I knew that I was probably the only person with the knowledge and
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.920]  resources and access in order to do something in order to help
[10:27.920 --> 10:29.240]  so many people that needed it.
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.280]  So I created the Alaska cannabis club while still working as a reporter
[10:33.560 --> 10:37.680]  and decided I would build the club up and step away from my career as a
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.000]  journalist, and I decided to do so in a public manner.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.960]  So I had one of the club's youngest patients.
[10:44.080 --> 10:47.200]  Um, his name was Solomon and he was battling testicular cancer.
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.480]  He decided he, he agreed to not disclose the fact that me, his
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.560]  interviewer was also the weed lady he was doing the story about.
[10:57.880 --> 10:59.840]  And so that pre-taped segment aired.
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.040]  I let the teleprompter run with something completely different from
[11:04.040 --> 11:05.360]  what I planned on saying.
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.920]  And I just spoke from my heart and I told everyone that I own the Alaska
[11:08.920 --> 11:11.880]  cannabis club and that I'd be quitting my job to fight for freedom and
[11:11.880 --> 11:12.480]  fairness.
[11:12.760 --> 11:15.320]  And as for this job, well, fuck it, I quit.
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.000]  And so that, um, led to more than a hundred million views, countless
[11:20.000 --> 11:20.840]  headlines.
[11:20.840 --> 11:25.080]  We rallied freedom fighters across the state of Alaska, across the world,
[11:25.080 --> 11:29.360]  really, but in Alaska, we got as many people registered to vote in that
[11:29.360 --> 11:31.400]  short span of time that we had left.
[11:31.640 --> 11:34.960]  And then from there, it was all about education, education, education.
[11:34.960 --> 11:39.080]  So we crisscrossed the massive state of Alaska, just sharing our own
[11:39.080 --> 11:44.640]  experiences, sharing where we came from, um, and addressing real concerns
[11:44.640 --> 11:46.160]  that our neighbors had.
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.160]  And that led to the legalization of marijuana in Alaska on November 4th
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.200]  of 2014.
[11:52.440 --> 11:55.640]  Well, thank you for putting your future and your career on the line.
[11:55.920 --> 11:58.200]  If that didn't work the way it was supposed to, you could have really put
[11:58.200 --> 11:58.920]  yourself in a hole.
[11:59.560 --> 12:01.040]  It was going to work though.
[12:01.080 --> 12:01.520]  It had to.
[12:01.520 --> 12:01.920]  Well, yeah.
[12:01.960 --> 12:02.120]  Yeah.
[12:02.160 --> 12:02.960]  It just had to.
[12:02.960 --> 12:03.360]  So thank you.
[12:03.400 --> 12:06.080]  That was, that's an amazing step to make, an amazing commitment to make.
[12:06.280 --> 12:07.000]  Well, thank you.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.480]  I, it was the right thing to do.
[12:08.480 --> 12:11.720]  I became a journalist because I wanted to make a difference and this was an
[12:11.720 --> 12:13.440]  opportunity to make a real difference.
[12:13.480 --> 12:16.000]  There's no difference to be made in journalism because the networks
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.240]  kind of limit you, don't they?
[12:17.240 --> 12:18.680]  They control all of that.
[12:18.680 --> 12:18.760]  Absolutely.
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.360]  Now you're telling the truth with me.
[12:20.400 --> 12:20.880]  Awesome.
[12:21.160 --> 12:25.640]  So, uh, that brings us to, uh, today here at the Cannabis Patients, uh, what
[12:25.640 --> 12:27.360]  is it, the Cannabis Patients Support Group?
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.480]  We kind of talked about it a little bit ago.
[12:29.640 --> 12:32.360]  Uh, can you give us a bunch of details about this and who's here and what we're
[12:32.360 --> 12:33.640]  going to do today and what we're going to hear?
[12:33.760 --> 12:34.160]  Right.
[12:34.240 --> 12:41.480]  Well, right now, cannabis patients from all walks of life, um, all different
[12:41.480 --> 12:44.760]  ailments are coming together and sharing their own experiences.
[12:44.760 --> 12:49.240]  This is a gathering that's the first of its kind where it isn't just Crohn's
[12:49.240 --> 12:53.320]  patients or patients suffering HIV or dealing with cancer.
[12:53.320 --> 12:58.120]  Everyone is coming together so that we can share the knowledge and, and we know
[12:58.120 --> 13:04.280]  that we're all growing and learning and that no one is the end all expert in this.
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.760]  So it's important that we all just continue sharing what we're learning.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.800]  So we get to where we have those direct answers and it isn't everyone still
[13:12.800 --> 13:15.040]  feeling their way through their treatment.
[13:15.480 --> 13:17.080]  You know, it is still a little foggy out there.
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.960]  The doctors can't guide you very well.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.440]  You've got bud tenders at dispensaries that are basically in charge
[13:21.440 --> 13:22.680]  of your medicine or caregivers.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.800]  Exactly.
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.360]  And when we're talking about medicine and how this would be handled by someone
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.280]  that's gone to school for years and years and can tell you exactly down to a
[13:31.280 --> 13:36.080]  science, how it's going to be affecting you, that's what we're working toward as,
[13:36.280 --> 13:39.920]  as an industry, as a medical marijuana community.
[13:39.920 --> 13:42.600]  And so this is one of those steps in that direction.
[13:42.840 --> 13:43.920]  I really look forward to the talks.
[13:43.920 --> 13:44.480]  I'm going to stick around.
[13:44.480 --> 13:45.480]  I'm going to record some of it.
[13:45.480 --> 13:48.200]  Uh, Richard gave me permission to do some recording, so I'm going to record you guys.
[13:48.360 --> 13:48.960]  Absolutely.
[13:48.960 --> 13:50.040]  Add some of that into the show.
[13:50.080 --> 13:51.360]  I've, I may do some editing.
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.000]  You don't know what will happen.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.200]  You may put some of that in there.
[13:53.240 --> 13:53.960]  Well, definitely.
[13:53.960 --> 13:56.120]  And Richard Haynes is organizing it.
[13:56.120 --> 13:57.720]  He's the founder of MD herb.
[13:58.000 --> 13:58.320]  Dr.
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.160]  Michelle Ross is co-hosting the event along with me.
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.480]  And we have several patients coming up to share their stories, including Richard
[14:05.480 --> 14:12.040]  Haynes, Bobby West, Ashley Weber, and a few more that will really touch hearts and
[14:12.040 --> 14:12.680]  open minds.
[14:12.680 --> 14:12.880]  Great.
[14:12.880 --> 14:14.240]  I hope to get some of that onto the show.
[14:14.400 --> 14:15.320]  I hope it comes out well.
[14:15.600 --> 14:18.360]  So I follow you on every social media outlet that there is.
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.080]  You're quite popular on the social media.
[14:20.520 --> 14:23.320]  A little while back, the Alaskan Cannabis Club was raided.
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.440]  It was a very few minutes after that you went to Facebook and posted a video.
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.120]  You seemed calmer in that video than you do right now.
[14:32.760 --> 14:33.600]  We just got raided.
[14:33.800 --> 14:34.960]  At least we're here again.
[14:34.960 --> 14:36.680]  I mean, it just is what it is.
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.400]  If that's what's happening now, then people need to know it.
[14:39.400 --> 14:45.720]  If we voted to stop something from happening and police and the authorities are
[14:45.720 --> 14:49.640]  circumventing the will of the voters, then everyone needs to know what's happening now so
[14:49.640 --> 14:50.840]  that people can show up.
[14:50.840 --> 14:52.520]  And they did show up because of that.
[14:52.640 --> 14:54.400]  How many times has that club been raided?
[14:55.400 --> 14:56.600]  We've been raided twice.
[14:56.600 --> 14:58.040]  OK, we've been raided twice.
[14:58.040 --> 14:59.480]  Pretty much comfortable with the routine now.
[14:59.520 --> 15:00.040]  You know what to do.
[15:00.040 --> 15:00.720]  Not comfortable.
[15:00.760 --> 15:02.720]  I mean, it's a horrible experience.
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.080]  No one should have a gun shoved in their face because of cannabis.
[15:06.080 --> 15:07.040]  Of cannabis. I agree.
[15:07.040 --> 15:07.880]  That's absurd.
[15:07.880 --> 15:08.800]  Yeah, we're not hurting anybody.
[15:08.800 --> 15:09.320]  We're trying to heal everybody.
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.600]  Exactly. And the fact that they felt the need to send more than a dozen armed officers
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.160]  and SWAT gear into my home to put guns in all of our faces, it's sad.
[15:19.160 --> 15:20.800]  But that shows that we're still fighting.
[15:20.800 --> 15:22.200]  You look like a pretty badass criminal.
[15:23.360 --> 15:24.520]  I know, right?
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.040]  You look pretty dangerous.
[15:25.040 --> 15:25.840]  So threatening.
[15:25.840 --> 15:28.080]  Yeah, you're definitely going to be one of the violent offenders.
[15:28.200 --> 15:31.160]  Well, I was impressed with how calmly you went on Facebook just minutes after.
[15:31.160 --> 15:32.200]  And you're like, we just got raided.
[15:32.200 --> 15:33.040]  I was definitely impressed.
[15:33.040 --> 15:36.800]  So that has to be a little bit of reporter experience, but I'm sure that's just your character.
[15:36.840 --> 15:37.600]  So that was awesome.
[15:37.600 --> 15:37.960]  Thank you.
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.040]  Well, thank you.
[15:39.040 --> 15:39.680]  That was amazing.
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.120]  So I've done a lot of interview questions.
[15:42.120 --> 15:43.480]  I kind of want to just have a little bit of fun.
[15:44.360 --> 15:45.760]  How do you prefer to consume your cannabis?
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.680]  Well, it depends on what I'm going for.
[15:48.760 --> 15:52.960]  OK, if I'm going for a calming effect, then I like a CBD spray.
[15:53.040 --> 15:53.680]  OK, yeah.
[15:53.680 --> 15:56.760]  Just spray a couple of pumps of CBD spray into her mouth and nobody noticed.
[15:56.760 --> 16:04.960]  I when I want to just relax and chill, then, of course, I well, yeah, I just like to smoke for the most part.
[16:04.960 --> 16:05.880]  OK, do you take dabs?
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.080]  I do dab.
[16:07.080 --> 16:07.600]  Of course I dab.
[16:07.600 --> 16:08.240]  I haven't seen that yet.
[16:08.240 --> 16:09.800]  So I'll have to take a dab with you eventually.
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.680]  I've seen you smoke plenty of blunts and flowers.
[16:11.680 --> 16:13.840]  Yeah, it's blunts that are preferable.
[16:13.840 --> 16:15.120]  I know I shouldn't say that.
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.320]  I know it's bad.
[16:16.320 --> 16:17.800]  I'll be honest, smoke what you want.
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.480]  But I know I'm going to and I do.
[16:21.200 --> 16:22.000]  And that's blunts.
[16:22.160 --> 16:23.240]  No one's going to tell you what to do.
[16:23.240 --> 16:23.920]  I can already tell.
[16:24.360 --> 16:25.440]  I can already tell.
[16:25.920 --> 16:26.640]  What's your favorite strain?
[16:26.640 --> 16:27.520]  Do you have a favorite strain?
[16:27.640 --> 16:28.440]  Jack Herrera.
[16:28.480 --> 16:28.960]  All right.
[16:28.960 --> 16:29.680]  Yeah, that was quick.
[16:29.680 --> 16:30.560]  You had no hesitation.
[16:30.560 --> 16:30.960]  No.
[16:30.960 --> 16:32.560]  So you like the sativa headbust sort of thing?
[16:32.560 --> 16:33.120]  I do.
[16:33.120 --> 16:34.040]  Absolutely.
[16:34.040 --> 16:35.560]  And everything that it stands for.
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.640]  Every time that I light up, I'm reminded.
[16:37.640 --> 16:39.520]  Reminded of the activism that we should all be supporting.
[16:39.520 --> 16:40.160]  Exactly.
[16:40.160 --> 16:41.000]  Keep on fighting.
[16:41.000 --> 16:41.480]  There we go.
[16:41.480 --> 16:42.360]  Every day, keep fighting.
[16:42.360 --> 16:42.960]  Never give up.
[16:43.600 --> 16:47.120]  So are you going to be here for the 420 events in Denver during the Cannabis Cup?
[16:47.480 --> 16:48.800]  I was here last year.
[16:48.840 --> 16:51.520]  That was my first U.S.
[16:51.520 --> 16:51.840]  Cannabis.
[16:51.840 --> 16:53.320]  That was my first Cannabis Cup period.
[16:53.320 --> 16:53.840]  And that was.
[16:53.840 --> 16:55.760]  Way too many people around you for me to get to you to say hi.
[16:55.920 --> 16:57.680]  There was a lot going on.
[16:57.680 --> 16:58.600]  You were popular that day.
[16:58.600 --> 16:59.240]  Yeah.
[16:59.240 --> 16:59.520]  Yeah.
[16:59.520 --> 17:03.240]  That was it was quite an experience and I would love to do it all again.
[17:03.280 --> 17:03.520]  OK.
[17:03.520 --> 17:04.360]  Well, I hope to see you there.
[17:04.360 --> 17:05.600]  If you're there, we're going to smoke again.
[17:05.640 --> 17:06.000]  OK.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.680]  We may do another round two of this interview.
[17:07.680 --> 17:08.480]  Let's plan on it.
[17:08.480 --> 17:09.120]  I appreciate it.
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.440]  You know, I was going to make sure that I let you get all of your plugs in and
[17:11.440 --> 17:12.000]  advertising.
[17:12.120 --> 17:14.560]  Tell everybody how we can find you on social media and your website.
[17:14.600 --> 17:17.800]  OK, well, you can, of course, find me at charlogreen.com.
[17:17.800 --> 17:22.080]  That'll contain all the links to my social media, Facebook, Instagram.
[17:22.600 --> 17:25.680]  We're constantly working on producing fresh new content.
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.360]  So you'll see video from tonight on charlogreen.com in just a few days.
[17:29.560 --> 17:32.240]  And you can get used to that constant content.
[17:32.440 --> 17:33.480]  I'm always on the road.
[17:33.480 --> 17:37.960]  So we're taking cameras along and giving you guys the opportunity to take in all
[17:37.960 --> 17:41.680]  of the information that I am blessed to to be receiving.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.120]  So charlogreen.com is one outlet.
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.240]  And also my main project right now is gogreen.org.
[17:48.280 --> 17:49.680]  That's green with an E at the end of it.
[17:50.040 --> 17:53.720]  It's all about cultivating diversity, unity and opportunity in cannabis.
[17:53.720 --> 17:58.480]  So what we're doing is having these sorts of events, looking for leaders in diverse
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.560]  communities that want to stand up and champion the movement for the people that
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.440]  that they share their own homes with, their community.
[18:07.440 --> 18:09.520]  Yes. And so gogreen.org.
[18:09.720 --> 18:11.080]  Check it out, you guys. Make sure you support it.
[18:11.080 --> 18:13.000]  Make sure you follow around all the social media outlets.
[18:13.400 --> 18:14.840]  Are you her assistant?
[18:14.840 --> 18:15.760]  Is that your official title?
[18:17.400 --> 18:18.400]  OK, well, you are today.
[18:18.640 --> 18:19.480]  You're going to be her assistant.
[18:19.480 --> 18:21.680]  Her assistant is giving me the it's time to wrap this up.
[18:21.680 --> 18:23.640]  So I'm going to let you go. Thank you very much for joining me.
[18:23.760 --> 18:25.320]  I look forward to seeing your presentation.
[18:25.320 --> 18:26.200]  All right. See you.
[18:26.200 --> 18:27.680]  You guys, I'll be right back to wrap up the show.
[18:32.640 --> 18:34.080]  Well, I feel like that went pretty well.
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.880]  That was my 10 minute interview with Charlotte Green.
[18:35.880 --> 18:37.640]  I hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I did.
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.840]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to Charlotte.
[18:39.960 --> 18:40.840]  Thanks for the interview.
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.000]  And also thank you for treating me like a VIP for the entire evening.
[18:44.200 --> 18:46.240]  And also big thanks to Richard from Urban.
[18:47.240 --> 18:49.480]  He gave me permission to record the entire event.
[18:49.760 --> 18:51.320]  You guys, I recorded the whole thing.
[18:51.320 --> 18:54.160]  Unfortunately, the sound quality was not super good.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.960]  It was not their fault. It was my fault.
[18:55.960 --> 18:58.360]  I just used my zoom age six little X, Y mic.
[18:58.600 --> 18:59.640]  I didn't pick it up real well.
[18:59.640 --> 19:00.680]  There was a lot of room noise.
[19:00.680 --> 19:02.560]  There was a lot of conversation in the back of the room.
[19:02.920 --> 19:05.760]  So I'm not going to torture you guys by making you listen to that.
[19:05.960 --> 19:09.120]  I do recommend that you go to a Denver patient support group
[19:09.120 --> 19:10.720]  if you ever get the opportunity.
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.200]  If there is a medical marijuana support group in your area,
[19:14.360 --> 19:15.960]  I highly recommend that you go to that.
[19:15.960 --> 19:17.120]  Go mingle with the patients.
[19:17.120 --> 19:20.920]  Go hear the testimony of these people whose lives are being dramatically
[19:20.920 --> 19:23.360]  improved by using medical cannabis.
[19:24.040 --> 19:25.960]  Several patients took the stage to speak.
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.120]  And one patient that really stood out in my mind was a young man
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.040]  who said that he had the opportunity to move to Colorado
[19:33.040 --> 19:35.000]  and use medical cannabis to feel better.
[19:35.200 --> 19:36.560]  And he feels much better now.
[19:36.560 --> 19:38.960]  He's able to run. He's able to play. He's able to jump.
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.760]  He's able to be a normal kid with energy.
[19:41.080 --> 19:43.520]  But the only downfall is that now he doesn't care to do that
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.160]  because all of his friends are in his home state
[19:46.160 --> 19:48.560]  where they do not allow medical cannabis.
[19:48.800 --> 19:51.200]  So you can go to these meetings. You can hear this testimony.
[19:51.440 --> 19:53.560]  If you don't believe in the power of medical cannabis,
[19:53.560 --> 19:54.840]  go to one of these meetings.
[19:54.840 --> 19:56.080]  Hear one of these children talk.
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.200]  Here's some of these adults talk.
[19:58.200 --> 20:00.600]  Some of these people develop these conditions.
[20:01.560 --> 20:03.840]  At adulthood, some of these people were in car accidents
[20:03.840 --> 20:06.800]  and developed conditions, then some of these people were born with conditions.
[20:07.080 --> 20:09.120]  If you go and listen to what these people say,
[20:09.120 --> 20:11.520]  you will be a believer of medical cannabis.
[20:11.520 --> 20:14.080]  Most of the people listening to the show already support cannabis anyway.
[20:14.160 --> 20:16.000]  Preaching to the choir, it feels like. Right.
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.120]  Anyway, I want to thank everybody for listening to the show.
[20:18.200 --> 20:20.480]  I'll be back in another seven days with another episode.

[23:23.100 --> 23:24.300]  It's been years. I know you.
[23:24.300 --> 23:27.100]  What's it like to be cool from mystic roots up in California?
[23:27.460 --> 23:29.460]  What's it like living my life?
[23:29.460 --> 23:32.420]  Rocking mics every night, smoking purple and white is tight.
[23:32.580 --> 23:35.180]  I can't lie. I'm loving how I'm living since birth.
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.260]  I've been giving ambition.
[23:36.260 --> 23:38.220]  Plus, they get to spit it.
[23:38.220 --> 23:40.060]  Both of them. I think they stop now.
[23:40.060 --> 23:41.060]  See me on the clock.
[23:41.060 --> 23:45.620]  Now got it on lots of lockdowns like a penitentiary.
[23:45.780 --> 23:48.220]  OK. Lifestyle's.
[23:48.220 --> 23:53.420]  What's it like living my life because my lifestyle like it's not my life.
[23:53.420 --> 23:55.220]  What's it like living on my life?
[23:55.220 --> 23:57.620]  Because my lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle.
[23:58.340 --> 24:01.860]  I'm the temper I got that gets about a long school enough.
[24:02.180 --> 24:05.820]  I'm smoking, bouncing, placing all night, no matter the time.
[24:05.820 --> 24:08.820]  Rolling my chase, I'm always down
[24:08.820 --> 24:11.820]  For some supersonic running buds
[24:11.820 --> 24:14.320]  Roaming with care and a special touch
[24:14.320 --> 24:16.820]  Frosty green, sticky sweet
[24:16.820 --> 24:18.320]  Good enough to eat
[24:18.320 --> 24:21.320]  You know that I be drinking, smoking, straight-raised ghosting
[24:21.320 --> 24:23.820]  Get my microphone and I be straight, my ghosting
[24:23.820 --> 24:26.320]  I be pumping out post, I'm thinking double dosage
[24:26.320 --> 24:29.320]  I be writing every day to keep the pain away, you know this
[24:29.320 --> 24:31.320]  Can you believe I get to do this for a living?
[24:31.320 --> 24:34.320]  I be sitting on top of the rhythm and channeling what I'm giving out
[24:34.320 --> 24:36.820]  Like fresh fruits and vegetables, nightclubs and festivals
[24:36.820 --> 24:39.320]  Signing, smoking, sipping, let me chill and take a breath
[24:39.320 --> 24:41.820]  So now what's it like living my life?
[24:41.820 --> 24:45.320]  Because my lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle's not free
[24:45.320 --> 24:47.320]  What's it like living my life?
[24:47.320 --> 24:50.320]  Because my lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle's not free
[24:50.320 --> 24:52.320]  What's it like living the life that you're living?
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.320]  Are you living it up or are you just pretending?
[24:55.320 --> 24:57.320]  That is what you gotta go and ask yourself
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.320]  Don't wanna live with regret and it's about the health
[25:00.320 --> 25:02.820]  So come on everybody, what's it gonna be?
[25:02.820 --> 25:05.320]  It's not always the time to run wild and free
[25:05.320 --> 25:07.820]  I'm not testing what you love, people, can't you see?
[25:07.820 --> 25:10.320]  I'm just chillin', making music that's a life for me
[25:10.320 --> 25:13.320]  I'm sorta keeping classy, it's bad-massy
[25:13.320 --> 25:15.820]  Rocking on the strap, it's about to get nasty
[25:15.820 --> 25:18.320]  Living my life right, Santa Cruz sunlight
[25:18.320 --> 25:20.820]  Playing music for my soul and I'm using self-control
[25:20.820 --> 25:23.820]  Cause the messages in the music and the music in the message
[25:23.820 --> 25:26.320]  Every day I'm living and I'm learning daily lessons
[25:26.320 --> 25:28.820]  Don't hold back, gotta tie in up the slack
[25:28.820 --> 25:31.820]  Vibe cause you're alive and you know that it's your life

[25:49.820 --> 25:52.820]  Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle, it's your life
[25:52.820 --> 25:54.820]  I wanted my life and let the Lord do the rest
[25:54.820 --> 25:58.820]  Atlanta's on the track, no one can contest
[25:58.820 --> 26:00.320]  And now we're talking about my style
[26:00.320 --> 26:02.640]  Walk onto the stage and make the crowd go wild
[26:02.640 --> 26:05.520]  We get famous, not weak among the nameless
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.160]  Look inside yourself and don't get trapped with all the gamers
[26:08.160 --> 26:10.400]  Global domination, mystic roots got heat
[26:10.400 --> 26:13.200]  You're addicted to the sound, put the prodded on the street

[26:23.280 --> 26:25.920]  This is the California lifestyle that I live
[26:25.920 --> 26:28.800]  Born and raised in the bay just to stay positive
[26:28.960 --> 26:30.960]  All the homies on the track spittin' the truth
[26:30.960 --> 26:33.840]  Watch a boy cool dog in the mystic roots
