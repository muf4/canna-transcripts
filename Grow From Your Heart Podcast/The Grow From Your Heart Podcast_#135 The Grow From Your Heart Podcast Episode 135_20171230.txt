[00:17.340 --> 00:19.380]  I'm your host. My friends call me Ross DeGeffo.
[00:19.380 --> 00:21.660]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:21.740 --> 00:24.580]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:24.580 --> 00:25.780]  for letting me use their music.
[00:25.780 --> 00:27.140]  I'm your host, Ross DeGeffo.
[00:27.140 --> 00:28.100]  I'll see you guys next time.
[00:47.340 --> 00:51.340]  And remember, if you like the music of my podcast, big up, big up to the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:51.340 --> 00:53.340]  You guys make sure you catch Mystic Roots on tour.
[00:53.340 --> 00:54.660]  They're coming through Colorado.
[00:54.660 --> 00:57.100]  They'll be in Boulder, June 5th.
[00:57.100 --> 00:58.660]  They'll be in Fort Collins, June 8th.
[00:58.660 --> 01:00.980]  They'll be at Cervantes in Denver, June 9th.
[01:00.980 --> 01:04.940]  And you know, I will be at the Black Sheep, June 11th with Catch Up Faya.
[01:04.940 --> 01:06.700]  Come see me, take some dabs with me.
[01:06.700 --> 01:07.580]  It'll be a good time.
[01:07.580 --> 01:10.340]  I'll turn down the music a little bit because I feel like I'm fucking yelling over it.
[01:10.340 --> 01:11.300]  Sorry about that.
[01:11.300 --> 01:13.460]  It was louder than I realized.
[01:13.460 --> 01:14.580]  We're having a party over here.
[01:14.580 --> 01:15.620]  Welcome to the party, everybody.
[01:15.620 --> 01:16.500]  Mood setter.
[01:16.500 --> 01:17.500]  Mood setter.
[01:17.500 --> 01:20.940]  To the left of me, you guys, is the always lovely, the traveling stoner, Miss Lindsey.
[01:20.940 --> 01:21.660]  How are you tonight?
[01:21.660 --> 01:22.660]  I'm doing good.
[01:22.660 --> 01:23.540]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:23.540 --> 01:24.300]  Absolutely.
[01:24.300 --> 01:26.100]  And in front of me is our buddy, White Mike.
[01:26.100 --> 01:27.100]  Welcome back, bro.
[01:27.100 --> 01:27.660]  Thanks, man.
[01:27.660 --> 01:28.300]  How you doing, man?
[01:28.300 --> 01:28.980]  Doing well.
[01:28.980 --> 01:29.460]  Good, good.
[01:29.460 --> 01:31.020]  Thanks for coming on the show, you guys.
[01:31.020 --> 01:36.380]  It's 1045 here on a lovely Friday evening in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:36.380 --> 01:37.540]  Getting them in when we can.
[01:37.540 --> 01:38.860]  Recording shows when we can.
[01:38.860 --> 01:44.260]  The reason I stumbled on the intro number, I'm not sure if this is going to be episode 135 or 136.
[01:44.300 --> 01:49.860]  I recorded an episode with the Colorado Podcast Boys and it just got out of hand.
[01:49.860 --> 01:55.540]  So that one may be used as a bonus episode and not a normal podcast feed episode.
[01:55.540 --> 02:00.060]  I'll just put it out like on a Thursday or something because there wasn't a whole lot of girl talk.
[02:00.060 --> 02:03.940]  I don't want Australians that would love the fuck out of you for any sort of extra content.
[02:03.940 --> 02:07.540]  That Australian guy was mentioned quite a bit in that episode.
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.860]  An hour of shenanigans with those three.
[02:09.860 --> 02:11.020]  It was pure shenanigans.
[02:11.020 --> 02:13.020]  I'm not sure which one of us will put it up first.
[02:13.340 --> 02:17.980]  Our Aussie friend, Seb, will listen to it the minute it drops on either one of our feeds.
[02:17.980 --> 02:19.180]  So if you guys...
[02:19.180 --> 02:20.140]  I've made my decision.
[02:20.140 --> 02:21.860]  This will be number 135.
[02:21.860 --> 02:25.460]  The Colorado Podcast Mix episode will be number 136.
[02:25.460 --> 02:26.620]  We'll put that out on a Thursday.
[02:26.620 --> 02:28.580]  That's how I'm going to do it.
[02:28.580 --> 02:30.140]  I apologize in advance, you guys.
[02:30.140 --> 02:31.340]  That podcast is a mess.
[02:31.340 --> 02:34.740]  There are some grow talks in there.
[02:34.740 --> 02:37.660]  But Jesse got real high and Adam likes to interrupt a lot.
[02:37.660 --> 02:41.100]  So it was hard to have a grow conversation.
[02:41.100 --> 02:41.820]  But it was fun.
[02:41.820 --> 02:44.300]  There was a lot of rambles and funness.
[02:44.300 --> 02:45.500]  So join us on 136.
[02:45.500 --> 02:46.500]  It's a good time.
[02:46.500 --> 02:50.340]  On this episode, I'm going to give a huge shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass.
[02:50.340 --> 02:51.940]  Elevate Glass Gallery in Colorado Springs.
[02:51.940 --> 02:52.860]  Make sure you check them out.
[02:52.860 --> 02:56.700]  It's 517 South Tejon in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:56.700 --> 02:57.740]  Go get yourself a new rig.
[02:57.740 --> 02:59.220]  Go say hello to the lovely ladies.
[02:59.220 --> 03:01.860]  Also, the podcast is available now on tokeradio.com.
[03:01.860 --> 03:05.860]  You can check out the show Wednesdays at 1 o'clock on tokeradio.com.
[03:05.860 --> 03:07.540]  Big old shout out to my buddy Citizen J.
[03:07.540 --> 03:10.860]  Thanks for putting me on the network.
[03:11.140 --> 03:15.620]  I think that's all of the official business that I need to spit out for right now.
[03:15.620 --> 03:16.620]  How are you guys doing?
[03:16.620 --> 03:17.620]  Doing good.
[03:17.620 --> 03:18.620]  You guys look high.
[03:18.620 --> 03:21.700]  You're staring at me like, dude, thank you for turning down that fucking music.
[03:21.700 --> 03:25.620]  You've got show notes and so far the topic's a secret, but I'm way too big to read upside
[03:25.620 --> 03:26.620]  down.
[03:26.620 --> 03:27.620]  I don't know about a secret.
[03:27.620 --> 03:29.740]  I just got an email that I wanted to read and I'm sure that you'll have a couple of
[03:29.740 --> 03:31.580]  things to chime in with because...
[03:31.580 --> 03:32.580]  Always.
[03:32.580 --> 03:33.580]  Yeah, always.
[03:33.580 --> 03:34.900]  And Lindsay always has good shit to say.
[03:34.900 --> 03:36.620]  She brings up good points that I overlook.
[03:36.620 --> 03:38.260]  So let's just jump right into it.
[03:38.260 --> 03:40.740]  We've got an email that's part of the topic of the show.
[03:41.620 --> 03:42.620]  This one comes from our friend.
[03:42.620 --> 03:44.620]  Does he want me to say his name or not?
[03:44.620 --> 03:47.100]  I'm not going to say his name because he's from an illegal state.
[03:47.100 --> 03:48.900]  It says that he lives in an illegal state.
[03:48.900 --> 03:51.180]  He says, hi, my name is something and I live in an illegal state.
[03:51.180 --> 03:54.740]  And I was wondering if you could do an episode about how to control fungus gnats.
[03:54.740 --> 03:57.740]  I know how to control fungus gnats.
[03:57.740 --> 03:59.060]  That's not too hard of a problem.
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.740]  Do you have a good method, bro?
[04:00.740 --> 04:04.260]  I don't have a great method.
[04:04.260 --> 04:09.860]  My one and only bug solution that I ever had the power to implement and really carry out
[04:09.980 --> 04:13.980]  to my own desire is sort of a nuclear.
[04:13.980 --> 04:17.340]  Did you go hard the one time you got bugs?
[04:17.340 --> 04:19.860]  The one time I got bugs, I got spider-bited bad.
[04:19.860 --> 04:21.660]  Oh, I remember that.
[04:21.660 --> 04:23.300]  I went to town.
[04:23.300 --> 04:26.780]  It's a month-long process that involves a couple gallons of bleach and killing everything
[04:26.780 --> 04:27.780]  you own plant-wise.
[04:27.780 --> 04:28.780]  It takes a long time.
[04:28.780 --> 04:29.780]  Yeah, you would really go crazy.
[04:29.780 --> 04:30.780]  It works.
[04:30.780 --> 04:31.780]  As a breeder, I don't have that option.
[04:31.780 --> 04:32.780]  No, a lot of people don't.
[04:32.780 --> 04:33.780]  As a breeder, I cannot do that.
[04:33.780 --> 04:34.780]  A lot of people have to fight, but no fungus gnats was never my thing.
[04:34.780 --> 04:35.780]  I don't have that option.
[04:35.780 --> 04:36.780]  I don't have that option.
[04:36.780 --> 04:37.780]  I don't have that option.
[04:37.780 --> 04:38.780]  I don't have that option.
[04:38.780 --> 04:39.780]  I don't have that option.
[04:39.780 --> 04:41.180]  No fungus gnats was never one I really had to play with.
[04:41.180 --> 04:43.500]  Well, this dude's asking about fungus gnats.
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.540]  Fungus gnats occur.
[04:44.540 --> 04:48.780]  They show up when your soil is kept too moist or when your medium is kept too moist.
[04:48.780 --> 04:52.460]  I'm growing in a giant commercial warehouse, and in that warehouse, we've got a giant floor
[04:52.460 --> 04:56.540]  drain, and oftentimes, I see little fucking fungus gnats trying to fly up through that
[04:56.540 --> 04:57.540]  floor drain.
[04:57.540 --> 04:58.540]  I can get rid of every bug in there, but-
[04:58.540 --> 04:59.540]  They transfer pretty good.
[04:59.540 --> 05:00.540]  I know that.
[05:00.540 --> 05:01.540]  Yeah.
[05:01.540 --> 05:02.860]  Those are the peat moss traveling fuckers.
[05:02.860 --> 05:03.860]  They love peat moss.
[05:03.860 --> 05:04.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:04.860 --> 05:05.860]  They come in soil all the time.
[05:05.860 --> 05:06.860]  You buy bags of soil, and they're in there.
[05:06.940 --> 05:09.540]  I've helped people fight these infestations.
[05:09.540 --> 05:13.380]  If you can keep moisture levels down a little bit in your soil, let your dirt dry up a little
[05:13.380 --> 05:14.380]  bit.
[05:14.380 --> 05:15.700]  That'll help get rid of them.
[05:15.700 --> 05:18.180]  You can use diatenaceous earth on top.
[05:18.180 --> 05:19.620]  Let the soil dry.
[05:19.620 --> 05:23.700]  Apply diatenaceous earth to the top of the soil or the medium if you got cocoa, and just
[05:23.700 --> 05:26.540]  leave it on there while it's dry, and then water a little later.
[05:26.540 --> 05:27.860]  You got to put that shit on there while it's dry.
[05:27.860 --> 05:29.620]  It works when it's dry.
[05:29.620 --> 05:31.920]  Then those bugs won't want to climb in there.
[05:31.920 --> 05:37.000]  What I recommend, if you're trying to stay all organic, there are little things at Lowe's
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.840]  or Home Depot called mosquito dunks.
[05:38.840 --> 05:41.840]  They're just little donut-looking things in a red package.
[05:41.840 --> 05:42.840]  Put those in the water.
[05:42.840 --> 05:43.840]  Submerge them in the water.
[05:43.840 --> 05:44.840]  Let them sit there for a little while.
[05:44.840 --> 05:45.840]  They'll get mushy.
[05:45.840 --> 05:49.600]  Wear a rubber glove, and rub them in your hand, and grind them up a little bit to where
[05:49.600 --> 05:53.040]  they turn into a powder, and let that sit in your reservoir, and put a little bit of
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.640]  that in each plant when you water.
[05:54.640 --> 05:58.040]  That's a beneficial bacteria that I cannot remember the name of right now.
[05:58.040 --> 06:01.320]  I know it, but since I'm trying to tell you, it's gone out of my mind.
[06:01.720 --> 06:04.320]  That beneficial bacteria will kill off the fungus gnats.
[06:04.320 --> 06:06.400]  It's cheap, effective, and organic in a home grow.
[06:06.400 --> 06:10.320]  If you're doing a big grow, you may need a product like Natrol, and you do the exact
[06:10.320 --> 06:11.320]  same process.
[06:11.320 --> 06:12.320]  You just feed that into the soil.
[06:12.320 --> 06:13.320]  Mike Lugino Yep.
[06:13.320 --> 06:17.160]  Then you're going to want to triple check that against your state's list if your state's
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.160]  gotten that far.
[06:18.160 --> 06:20.520]  This is a home grow letter, isn't it?
[06:20.520 --> 06:22.400]  Aaron Alexander Yeah, this is a home grow guy in an illegal
[06:22.400 --> 06:23.400]  state.
[06:23.400 --> 06:25.520]  Mike Lugino Dude, the mosquito dunk solution's not a bad
[06:25.520 --> 06:26.520]  one.
[06:26.520 --> 06:33.440]  I mean, honestly, go back and listen to the episodes about ways of maintaining your garden
[06:33.440 --> 06:36.040]  to really prevent infestations from occurring.
[06:36.040 --> 06:39.120]  Unfortunately, with fungus gnats, a lot of times people bring them home from the grow
[06:39.120 --> 06:40.120]  store.
[06:40.120 --> 06:41.920]  Aaron Alexander Yeah, they come in the soil quite often.
[06:41.920 --> 06:43.480]  I've had thrips come in soil.
[06:43.480 --> 06:45.560]  I can't say that I've had spider mites come in soil.
[06:45.560 --> 06:46.560]  I have no evidence of that.
[06:46.560 --> 06:48.320]  Mike Lugino The two people I've helped deal with this,
[06:48.320 --> 06:55.400]  one of them got them when the guy that lived in the other side of the split level started
[06:55.400 --> 06:56.400]  to grow.
[06:56.480 --> 06:57.480]  Aaron Alexander Oh, the guy that had two separate grows
[06:57.480 --> 06:58.480]  in one domicile?
[06:58.480 --> 06:59.480]  Yeah, that's dangerous.
[06:59.480 --> 07:03.160]  Mike Lugino The dude that started the second little fun
[07:03.160 --> 07:08.480]  closet grow brought home fungus gnats in his soil.
[07:08.480 --> 07:12.600]  The guy growing on the other side of the grow immensely.
[07:12.600 --> 07:17.000]  Then the other person I know that got them, that neighbor on the other side of the fence,
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.280]  or the other side of the alley rather, we couldn't figure out where they came from.
[07:21.280 --> 07:23.440]  It didn't make any sense.
[07:23.440 --> 07:26.840]  We just wandered in and found the plant and went nuts was our best guess.
[07:26.840 --> 07:29.400]  Then we heard them harvesting.
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.800]  They were bitching about all the little white bugs flying out of the bud while we were like,
[07:33.800 --> 07:34.800]  well, that's where they came from.
[07:34.800 --> 07:36.120]  Aaron Alexander Now we've got those bugs.
[07:36.120 --> 07:38.720]  Mike Lugino Yeah, and we can't retaliate or say anything
[07:38.720 --> 07:44.200]  right now because we don't want them to know we had plants back here.
[07:44.200 --> 07:46.200]  They thought their weed smelled good.
[07:46.200 --> 07:50.160]  They were smelling our weed.
[07:50.160 --> 07:57.160]  Neither of those were under my care, but both of them were really hard to prevent type situations.
[07:57.160 --> 07:59.200]  Aaron Alexander Yeah, the way to get rid of fungus gnats
[07:59.200 --> 08:02.980]  I think is either the dunks or natural and dry out your soil.
[08:02.980 --> 08:06.120]  You can always use Azimax as a soil drench.
[08:06.120 --> 08:07.880]  Use it really lightly, mix it in with water.
[08:07.880 --> 08:09.520]  I do not know the ratio.
[08:09.520 --> 08:12.880]  It says on the container as a soil drench.
[08:12.880 --> 08:17.680]  Pour a little bit of Azimax into some water and just water the plants with that.
[08:17.680 --> 08:19.160]  That'll help you out with fungus gnats.
[08:19.160 --> 08:22.520]  I wouldn't go that route unless it's extreme, but it will work.
[08:22.520 --> 08:25.160]  Unless your plants are really healthy, I don't know that I would do it, but it'll work.
[08:25.160 --> 08:27.400]  Mike Lugino It sounds like you're at least headed to Lowe's
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.400]  or the local hydroponics.
[08:28.400 --> 08:31.600]  Aaron Alexander Yeah, go to Lowe's and try.
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.360]  Put the mosquito dunks in there and water.
[08:33.360 --> 08:39.600]  If you have the time, depending on how big your plants are, cover up the soil.
[08:39.600 --> 08:43.640]  If you can maybe take a paper plate and cut a slit up it and then put the stem in that
[08:43.640 --> 08:47.480]  slit and then cover up the soil so that the bugs don't have a way in or out, then the
[08:47.480 --> 08:49.840]  bugs that are in there will stay in there and die.
[08:49.840 --> 08:51.120]  No more bugs will be able to land in there.
[08:51.120 --> 08:52.120]  They won't be breeding.
[08:52.120 --> 08:53.120]  That'll help you keep more shit out too.
[08:53.120 --> 08:55.280]  So the paper plate method will be totally helpful.
[08:55.280 --> 08:58.800]  Diatonaceous earth if you want to go hard on it, but I think the mosquito dunks or some
[08:58.800 --> 09:00.200]  natural will solve your problem.
[09:00.200 --> 09:02.440]  All right, part two of this email.
[09:02.440 --> 09:06.080]  This dude says also, could you speak about the laws in Pueblo, Colorado for growing your
[09:06.080 --> 09:07.240]  own medicine?
[09:07.240 --> 09:08.240]  Maybe about four to six plants.
[09:08.240 --> 09:09.560]  And then he says, thank you.
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.000]  I love the show and enjoy all of the educational, God damn, excuse that, all of the educational
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.560]  information you give.
[09:16.640 --> 09:17.640]  Dude, thanks for listening.
[09:17.640 --> 09:18.640]  I appreciate it.
[09:18.640 --> 09:19.640]  Thanks for the email.
[09:19.640 --> 09:22.920]  I'm going to let Mike talk a little bit about growing laws in Pueblo, Colorado.
[09:22.920 --> 09:26.960]  Okay, so the city and the county of Pueblo are two different legal entities.
[09:26.960 --> 09:27.960]  Dropping dimes.
[09:27.960 --> 09:28.960]  It was a nickel actually.
[09:28.960 --> 09:29.960]  Close.
[09:29.960 --> 09:30.960]  So Poe, you dropping nickels?
[09:30.960 --> 09:31.960]  Yeah, I know.
[09:31.960 --> 09:32.960]  Right?
[09:32.960 --> 09:39.080]  So the city and county both have slightly different rules.
[09:39.080 --> 09:44.800]  For four to six plants though, in all of Colorado, any adult can legally grow six plants just
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.280]  because Amendment 64 passed and marijuana is legal here.
[09:49.280 --> 09:56.400]  So as long as you keep no more than three plants per adult in the household in flower,
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.840]  and then say you were living inside city limits, you kept those no more than three plants in
[10:01.840 --> 10:08.200]  flour and then your three veg plants in no more than a hundred square foot grow space.
[10:08.200 --> 10:09.760]  Ten by ten.
[10:09.760 --> 10:11.480]  You'd pretty much be covered.
[10:11.480 --> 10:14.520]  That's a pretty small grow space.
[10:15.240 --> 10:17.240]  They wanted to make it a lot smaller.
[10:17.240 --> 10:18.600]  But Mike helped fight for it.
[10:18.600 --> 10:20.560]  Yeah, and they wanted to deliver your plant count.
[10:20.560 --> 10:25.680]  And basically me and one other citizen who does not like his name being shared publicly,
[10:25.680 --> 10:27.960]  but you know who you are.
[10:27.960 --> 10:29.840]  Thank you for the help with that fight.
[10:29.840 --> 10:30.840]  Does he listen?
[10:30.840 --> 10:31.840]  I have no idea.
[10:31.840 --> 10:32.840]  Okay.
[10:32.840 --> 10:33.840]  Well, shout out either way.
[10:33.840 --> 10:34.840]  I was just recently at his house.
[10:34.840 --> 10:35.840]  Fist bump.
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.480]  He does amazing work.
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.440]  But yeah, so in the city, you just got to keep your grow restricted to the total square
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.600]  footage under a hundred square feet, which is ten by ten.
[10:49.600 --> 10:57.240]  Or in the county, there's a square foot limit, I think, overall, but it's pretty big.
[10:57.240 --> 11:01.040]  And then there's a plant count that's total per household.
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.480]  But if you're talking about just growing your own six legal plants under Amendment 64 for
[11:06.480 --> 11:11.840]  say you and a domestic partner, that would be 12 plants total.
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.800]  You're under the limit.
[11:14.160 --> 11:19.320]  And honestly, before you started your grow in either of those locations, I would recommend
[11:19.320 --> 11:23.720]  heading to the appropriate zoning department because there are two of them.
[11:23.720 --> 11:27.680]  And just asking politely for a copy of the home grow rules, which they're happy to give
[11:27.680 --> 11:32.680]  you or tell you how to find so that you can go home and follow them.
[11:32.680 --> 11:36.080]  And right now there's a bunch of raids going on right now.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.440]  People that moved here didn't read the rules.
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.760]  A couple of them are quoted as going, yeah, come in and look like it's legal here, right?
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.240]  Like, yeah, but there's rules and you ain't following them, so you're going to jail just
[11:48.240 --> 11:54.240]  like you would in Texas or Florida for the same crimes with the same penalties.
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.440]  But weed's legal here.
[11:55.440 --> 11:56.440]  It's a weird conundrum.
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.920]  But the rules are easy to follow, especially if you're looking for personal harvest sizes.
[12:03.920 --> 12:07.640]  You can play with your numbers and your grow space and stuff and kind of maximize that.
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.800]  But for a small grow, four to six plants, it's super easy to follow the rules.
[12:12.840 --> 12:16.040]  Some counties have made different grow plant count limits.
[12:16.040 --> 12:17.960]  Some counties don't have any plant count limits.
[12:17.960 --> 12:21.200]  Yep, that changes in every legal jurisdiction in Pueblo.
[12:21.200 --> 12:22.200]  And if in Colorado.
[12:22.200 --> 12:23.820]  Or in Colorado, I'm sorry.
[12:23.820 --> 12:29.360]  When you go to the medical marijuana doctor, you can ask them to possibly recommend more
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.640]  plants so that you can have more medicine and they'll write you an extended plant count
[12:33.640 --> 12:35.000]  if you qualify.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.320]  And then in some counties you're able to grow however many your card says.
[12:38.320 --> 12:42.160]  A lot of counties have limited you a lot, just let you do your thing.
[12:42.520 --> 12:47.720]  Yeah, more and more counties and cities, towns, everything, every little jurisdiction in Colorado,
[12:47.720 --> 12:53.760]  they're starting to pass rules limiting the total size of a home cultivation.
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.000]  Basically unless you own property where you could grow acres and acres of corn within
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.680]  the next year to expect that that area will have passed a limit of at least 20 plants
[13:04.680 --> 13:11.840]  or maybe 200 or 300 square feet total grow space in a private residence in Colorado.
[13:11.960 --> 13:14.440]  I think that's a pretty fair bet.
[13:14.440 --> 13:17.720]  All right, so I hope we answered your question very well.
[13:17.720 --> 13:19.000]  I think we got into that one.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Yeah.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  Thanks for your help on that, Mike.
[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  Happy to.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  We got another message.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  This one came on Facebook.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.920]  I'm not going to say the dude's name because I don't know if people want their name said.
[13:26.920 --> 13:27.920]  He sent me a private message.
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.360]  He said, listening to your latest podcast, digging it as usual, just a quick heads up
[13:31.360 --> 13:34.200]  on your chloramine question for a listener.
[13:34.200 --> 13:35.200]  And that's for Seb.
[13:35.200 --> 13:36.200]  Shout out to Seb.
[13:36.200 --> 13:38.200]  Seb asked about the chloramine.
[13:38.200 --> 13:40.800]  That was hard as shit to say.
[13:40.800 --> 13:45.120]  Chloramine is a gas that can be bubbled or evaporated, but chloramine is not.
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.800]  No amount of bubbling will remove chloramine.
[13:47.800 --> 13:53.160]  In fact, its ability to stay in solution is the reason water municipalities are switching
[13:53.160 --> 13:54.160]  to it.
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.320]  RO is the only thing that will work.
[13:57.320 --> 14:01.680]  Unfortunately, I know this guy knows what he's talking about because he used the phrase
[14:01.680 --> 14:03.480]  stays in solution.
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.320]  And that is definitely organic chemistry major speak because we have a we share a mutual
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.600]  friend who is an O chem major and he says shit like that to me all the time.
[14:11.600 --> 14:13.440]  So that makes me think he knows what he's talking about.
[14:13.440 --> 14:14.800]  So shout out to this guy.
[14:14.800 --> 14:16.280]  Uh, Seb, are you listening?
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.520]  My friend chloramine, the only way to get the chloramine out of your water is a reverse
[14:20.520 --> 14:21.520]  osmosis machine.
[14:21.520 --> 14:22.760]  So you're going to have to purchase one of those.
[14:22.760 --> 14:23.760]  They sell a cheap one, bro.
[14:23.760 --> 14:25.520]  They sell a small model.
[14:25.520 --> 14:28.260]  Don't go to the hydro shop for an RO machine.
[14:28.260 --> 14:31.800]  Go to either like we got a Walmart here in the States.
[14:31.800 --> 14:36.560]  I don't know what you guys have in Australia, but like a, uh, like a home, like wherever
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.080]  you do like betting for Seb, the internet's going to be his best bet on this one.
[14:40.080 --> 14:41.080]  Yeah.
[14:41.080 --> 14:44.120]  I said, go to the internet and find yourself an affordable reverse osmosis machine.
[14:44.120 --> 14:45.120]  You don't need a lot of water.
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.840]  I don't think baked or could he just boil off and collect.
[14:50.840 --> 14:51.840]  You know what I mean?
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.240]  I don't know if a distilling water would work because this guy here says that it will stay
[14:56.240 --> 14:59.560]  in solution and I don't know how that's going to work when you distill it.
[14:59.560 --> 15:01.380]  I don't know if the chloramine is going to move.
[15:01.380 --> 15:05.120]  This is like seventh grade science, but I'm pretty sure he just need the evaporation.
[15:05.680 --> 15:12.320]  So now you've got me imagining my buddy said in Australia, you just still in a bunch of
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.040]  water out in the bush, highest shit chasing the emu.
[15:16.040 --> 15:18.400]  I was just going to say, watch your back.
[15:18.400 --> 15:20.480]  There's wild animals.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.480]  Everything's trying to fucking kill him.
[15:21.480 --> 15:22.480]  Now let's help this dude out.
[15:22.480 --> 15:24.560]  He needs a reverse osmosis machine, bro.
[15:24.560 --> 15:26.920]  Seb, uh, go get her RO machine.
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.920]  It's what you got to do, bro.
[15:27.920 --> 15:29.680]  Just, just go get the right equipment.
[15:29.680 --> 15:30.960]  That's important for the grow.
[15:30.960 --> 15:31.960]  You want the water clean?
[15:31.960 --> 15:33.120]  You want the water pure?
[15:33.120 --> 15:34.120]  Go get that machine.
[15:34.120 --> 15:35.640]  Get that chlorine out of there.
[15:35.640 --> 15:36.640]  Do it, do it.
[15:36.640 --> 15:37.640]  All right.
[15:37.640 --> 15:39.920]  Uh, thanks to a, he said, hope that helps.
[15:39.920 --> 15:41.440]  It's keep up the great work.
[15:41.440 --> 15:42.960]  Part of the little community you've built.
[15:42.960 --> 15:43.960]  Yeah.
[15:43.960 --> 15:45.280]  Oh, the people that send in the messages are great.
[15:45.280 --> 15:48.880]  I totally appreciate them because there'll be sometimes when I'm not exactly sure what
[15:48.880 --> 15:49.880]  I want to talk about.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.880]  I'll have a couple of ideas.
[15:50.880 --> 15:52.680]  I've got tons of notes written down for this podcast.
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.160]  If I ever run out of info, I'm just like, Oh look, here's the notebook and there's tons
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.160]  of shit.
[15:56.160 --> 15:59.120]  But when these guys send messages, I'm like, Oh, there's that's instant shit that I need
[15:59.120 --> 16:00.120]  to talk about.
[16:00.120 --> 16:01.120]  These guys want to know.
[16:01.120 --> 16:02.120]  So I just go and do some research if I need to.
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.120]  And most of the time I can spit it out off the top of my head.
[16:04.120 --> 16:06.120]  I like that this guy just solved subs problem.
[16:06.120 --> 16:07.120]  Yup.
[16:07.120 --> 16:08.120]  I just got to be a medium.
[16:08.120 --> 16:09.120]  Is that what I did?
[16:09.120 --> 16:10.120]  Yup.
[16:10.120 --> 16:11.120]  That's weird.
[16:11.120 --> 16:12.120]  All right.
[16:12.120 --> 16:15.160]  So that's a, that's the core mean message that I wrote down.
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.880]  So we're talking about this a little bit ago.
[16:16.880 --> 16:19.720]  I just went and got my MMJ card, my medical marijuana recommendation.
[16:19.720 --> 16:21.920]  I'm going to rant for a minute.
[16:21.920 --> 16:22.960]  There is in Colorado.
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.760]  There's no, I don't think anywhere in the United States is there a medical marijuana
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.600]  prescription, other than the type that Irv Rosenfeld has, which is a totally different
[16:31.600 --> 16:33.960]  thing than what's available to us.
[16:33.960 --> 16:35.840]  So it's a recommendation.
[16:35.840 --> 16:38.920]  If you've got a medical marijuana card here in Colorado, it is a recommendation.
[16:38.920 --> 16:42.040]  It's a recommendation from a doctor that you use cannabis to alleviate your problems.
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.320]  It's not a prescription because they can't prescribe it to you because there's nowhere
[16:44.320 --> 16:45.320]  to go get it.
[16:45.320 --> 16:49.600]  So it's a recommendation, but people, I was talking about getting my medical marijuana
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.200]  recommendation renewed a few days ago, talking about when I got stuck in the damn elevator
[16:54.200 --> 16:56.360]  and a couple of people were like, well, how do I get my card?
[16:56.360 --> 16:59.800]  And I'm sure that since you work at a dispensary and you work at a dispensary, you guys hear
[16:59.800 --> 17:00.880]  it at least once a week.
[17:00.880 --> 17:02.880]  Not as much Mike, because his place is recreational.
[17:02.880 --> 17:03.880]  You hear about it constantly.
[17:03.880 --> 17:04.880]  Yeah.
[17:04.880 --> 17:05.880]  Okay.
[17:05.880 --> 17:09.680]  So let's just do a little brief talk about how you get your medical marijuana card.
[17:09.680 --> 17:12.920]  First of all, you've got to be a Colorado citizen and have some sort of proof of residency.
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.840]  You need a Colorado ID or some sort of bills that show that you're getting bills here in
[17:16.840 --> 17:17.840]  Colorado.
[17:17.840 --> 17:20.760]  So your phone bills, water bill, electricity bill, some kind of shit like that.
[17:20.760 --> 17:21.840]  You need some bills.
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.280]  If you don't have the proper ID, either you need a proper ID or two things that will prove
[17:25.280 --> 17:28.960]  that you're now a Colorado resident, like a pay stub and a bill or something.
[17:28.960 --> 17:30.240]  So that's, that's where you got to start.
[17:30.600 --> 17:33.000]  So if you're a former resident of Colorado, get established here, get your shit together,
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  have an address.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.320]  Uh, the second thing, do you have, this is what I used to say when I worked at a dispensary
[17:38.320 --> 17:40.840]  like 10 years ago and people would be like, well, can I get a card?
[17:40.840 --> 17:45.040]  I would say, do you have a condition that would justify the use of medical cannabis?
[17:45.040 --> 17:48.000]  Do you have a qualified condition that would justify the use of medical cannabis to improve
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  the quality of your life?
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.360]  That's what I used to ask people.
[17:50.360 --> 17:51.360]  Yeah.
[17:51.360 --> 17:52.360]  Yeah.
[17:52.360 --> 17:55.640]  So if you have, yeah, there's a list on the, uh, Colorado department of public health and
[17:55.640 --> 17:56.640]  environment.
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.040]  There's a list of qualifying conditions on there of things that qualify, uh, something
[18:02.040 --> 18:03.560]  hurts.
[18:03.560 --> 18:07.720]  Severe pain is a qualifying condition and I'm sure that something hurts.
[18:07.720 --> 18:13.720]  There's seven or nine listed and if you don't have one, um, but you've got chronic pain
[18:13.720 --> 18:17.320]  of some sort, getting a car just involves two appointments.
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.320]  Yeah.
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.320]  Yeah.
[18:19.320 --> 18:23.120]  And just have a reason why it hurts and have something that hurts and stick with it and
[18:23.120 --> 18:24.320]  have a, know when it happened.
[18:24.440 --> 18:27.040]  And if you can have some paperwork on it, that's way even better.
[18:27.040 --> 18:32.080]  Not even really two appointments, one appointment and one trip to the post office.
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.600]  If you go to a, so Mike's jumping ahead, Mike's doing Mike's getting extra credit.
[18:36.600 --> 18:37.680]  No, this shit's easy.
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.080]  So, uh, have a condition, figure out what your condition is, figure out what hurts,
[18:41.080 --> 18:42.080]  figure out how you qualify.
[18:42.080 --> 18:45.240]  Then you call looking like the Colorado Springs independent.
[18:45.240 --> 18:46.760]  If you're in Denver, look in the Westward.
[18:46.760 --> 18:48.960]  If you're in Pueblo, do we have, we have the pulp.
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.480]  I'm sure there's somewhere that you can look for a medical marijuana doctor in your region.
[18:53.640 --> 18:56.520]  If you're in Colorado or if you're in a state that supports medical marijuana, there's a
[18:56.520 --> 18:57.520]  way to find the doctor.
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.000]  Google medical marijuana doctor, your state or medical marijuana, your zip code.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.880]  You'll find them or ask one of your friends that has a medical marijuana card where their
[19:04.880 --> 19:05.880]  doctor is.
[19:05.880 --> 19:08.040]  A shout out to my MMJ doc.
[19:08.040 --> 19:09.040]  I'm not going to say his name.
[19:09.040 --> 19:10.040]  Cause he's overbooked.
[19:10.040 --> 19:14.160]  Like if you've got to go see your doctor anyway, they're a doctor.
[19:14.160 --> 19:15.160]  Just ask.
[19:15.160 --> 19:18.040]  I'm over 900 doctors in the state of signs.
[19:18.040 --> 19:19.600]  So they're not exactly hard to find.
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.040]  I realized is why I looked up the other day in the office at my docs thing that he's a
[19:24.040 --> 19:25.040]  medical examiner.
[19:25.040 --> 19:26.480]  Does that mean he's the coroner?
[19:26.480 --> 19:27.480]  It means he can be.
[19:27.480 --> 19:28.480]  Okay.
[19:28.480 --> 19:29.480]  Yeah.
[19:29.480 --> 19:30.480]  That's kind of weird.
[19:30.480 --> 19:31.480]  Do you remember how it was in the beginning though?
[19:31.480 --> 19:32.480]  Oh yeah.
[19:32.480 --> 19:34.600]  Like three doctors and they all had like a six month waiting time.
[19:34.600 --> 19:35.600]  Yeah.
[19:35.600 --> 19:38.160]  Remember that crazy guy that used to come to our dispensary and give cards?
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.160]  Yep.
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.160]  Dude.
[19:40.160 --> 19:41.680]  Back in the day you could go into the dispensary and there would be a doctor in there that
[19:41.680 --> 19:45.120]  would write your recommendation and you could shop by the time that doctor got done filling
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.920]  out your name, you were already picking it up.
[19:46.920 --> 19:47.920]  That was crazy.
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.920]  It's not like that anymore.
[19:48.920 --> 19:54.480]  So now you go to the doctor, I figure out your condition, set an appointment, find one
[19:54.480 --> 19:59.080]  of these doctors, set an appointment, have records if you really want to know what hurts
[19:59.080 --> 20:00.920]  and then know what to say.
[20:00.920 --> 20:03.560]  Like don't go in there when they're like, so why do you need weed?
[20:03.560 --> 20:07.040]  Because I don't like not having weed actually sound professional.
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.040]  Go in there and be legit.
[20:08.040 --> 20:14.320]  Um, yeah, honestly, the, our medical marijuana program here in Colorado is under enough scrutiny
[20:14.320 --> 20:20.160]  and pressure and under fire, but in the legislature, if you can't manage to get through the interview
[20:20.160 --> 20:24.880]  with the doctor without looking like a jackass and hurt the movement, just stay home.
[20:24.880 --> 20:25.880]  Yeah.
[20:25.880 --> 20:28.240]  If you don't deserve a card, it's really not hard at all.
[20:28.240 --> 20:29.520]  Especially if you're coming to be an activist.
[20:29.520 --> 20:32.480]  I liked earlier, Mike said, don't show up with your weed cape.
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.480]  Like yeah.
[20:33.480 --> 20:34.480]  Yep.
[20:34.480 --> 20:41.200]  Um, like if your knee hurts, like if you can elaborate on that for more than a minute or
[20:41.360 --> 20:44.880]  a minute, um, using medical terminology because you've seen other doctors because your knee
[20:44.880 --> 20:48.240]  hurts and they recommended other shit for your knee hurting.
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.360]  Um, getting a medical marijuana card for your chronic knee pain will not be a problem.
[20:53.360 --> 20:55.840]  If you want an extended plant count, you're going to need to be prepared.
[20:55.840 --> 20:58.120]  You're going to have to have some sort of crunching noises.
[20:58.120 --> 21:00.960]  You're going to have to show some kind of scars or if you've got some paperwork that
[21:00.960 --> 21:01.960]  would really help.
[21:01.960 --> 21:06.400]  So you can ask your doctor, would you be willing to write an extended plant count for me?
[21:06.400 --> 21:08.320]  And he may ask you how many you want.
[21:08.320 --> 21:10.120]  Be prepared to pay for this.
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.160]  Uh, the normal cost of a doctor should be around a hundred dollars.
[21:14.160 --> 21:17.360]  The basic cost to get your basic card should be around a hundred bucks.
[21:17.360 --> 21:21.420]  If you're going to get an added fee of probably another hundred dollars to get an elevated
[21:21.420 --> 21:25.200]  plant count, depending on how high it is, there are some doctors that will go fairly
[21:25.200 --> 21:28.600]  high and they will charge you up to four or $500.
[21:28.600 --> 21:29.600]  Don't get a cut.
[21:29.600 --> 21:30.600]  This is my recommendation.
[21:30.600 --> 21:31.600]  I'm not a fucking lawyer.
[21:31.600 --> 21:33.400]  Uh, I'm a weed guy.
[21:33.400 --> 21:35.640]  This is my experience in the cannabis world.
[21:35.640 --> 21:37.640]  Don't get one of those 99 plant counts.
[21:37.720 --> 21:41.920]  Uh, that's a red flag for a person that is fucking around and trying to beat the system
[21:41.920 --> 21:44.000]  and do something that they shouldn't be doing.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.440]  Um, there are a couple of 500 count cards in the state.
[21:48.440 --> 21:49.440]  Don't do that shit either.
[21:49.440 --> 21:54.480]  Um, and there's like eight of them and they're all on a list and the MEDs spend all of the
[21:54.480 --> 21:55.480]  addresses.
[21:55.480 --> 21:56.480]  Yeah.
[21:56.480 --> 22:00.600]  Um, and the same thing with the 250 counts and the 300 counts.
[22:00.600 --> 22:04.760]  It's all of that's going to be gone in a year, maybe two at the most.
[22:05.080 --> 22:08.280]  Um, and it's because of one or two people abusing it.
[22:08.280 --> 22:12.520]  Cause one of the people with the 500 count cards is making oil for kids and he gives
[22:12.520 --> 22:13.520]  it all away.
[22:13.520 --> 22:15.920]  So like they're not all game in the system.
[22:15.920 --> 22:20.520]  They're not, um, most of them in fact are following the rules, but there's been one
[22:20.520 --> 22:26.160]  or two really, really obnoxious people that have really, really pushed the boundaries
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.880]  and most of that system is going to get regulated away the next two years.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.240]  Um, the caregiver is going to be a thing in the past by 2020.
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.640]  Well, I'm glad you said a caregiver just now, cause that's part of the next step.
[22:38.640 --> 22:42.280]  Um, ask the doc for an elevated plant count if you desire, pay for it.
[22:42.280 --> 22:46.640]  Um, then, uh, you're going to be asked at this time, you're going to start signing a
[22:46.640 --> 22:47.640]  bunch of papers.
[22:47.640 --> 22:49.880]  You're going to be asked to assign a provider.
[22:49.880 --> 22:53.480]  If you plan on growing your own medicine, you do not want to assign a provider.
[22:53.480 --> 22:58.320]  If you are going to be a caregiver, you cannot be a, have a provider, nor can you have a
[22:58.320 --> 23:00.000]  dispensary as your provider.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.200]  If you're going to be a caregiver, if you become a care, if you sign your rights to
[23:03.200 --> 23:07.000]  the plants to a caregiver, you have now waived your rights as a caregiver.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  I think I said that correctly.
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.040]  There's a lot of words that I was trying to get out properly.
[23:10.040 --> 23:11.800]  So decide who you want to grow your cannabis.
[23:11.800 --> 23:15.760]  If it's a trusted friend, I have a couple of people like Mike and our good buddy, Doug,
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.920]  I am responsible for growing their cannabis and keeping these guys medicated and feeling
[23:19.920 --> 23:20.920]  all right.
[23:20.920 --> 23:25.080]  So if you know somebody that grows well and you trust them, uh, make an arrangement with
[23:25.080 --> 23:29.540]  them, uh, make a relationship with them and have an agreement where the medicine comes
[23:29.540 --> 23:32.900]  and they're ready for it and they've got it and you've got it and shit works and then
[23:32.900 --> 23:34.700]  make them, you have to get papers notarized.
[23:34.700 --> 23:38.220]  You'll need a copy of their ID if you're going to make them your caregiver.
[23:38.220 --> 23:41.940]  But so the doctor will have everything that you need other than your buddy's ID.
[23:41.940 --> 23:42.940]  There'll be a notary there.
[23:42.940 --> 23:44.280]  They'll take care of all that shit.
[23:44.280 --> 23:47.980]  So assign a caregiver and then they're going to give you a bunch of papers.
[23:47.980 --> 23:49.060]  You'll need a money order.
[23:49.060 --> 23:51.020]  A lot of the places will give you the money order.
[23:51.020 --> 23:52.740]  They'll have it there for you.
[23:52.740 --> 23:57.060]  If not, just go to wherever, go to the Western union, loaf and jugs, seven 11, wherever sells
[23:57.060 --> 23:58.300]  a damn money order to the post office.
[23:58.300 --> 23:59.700]  Go get yourself a money order.
[23:59.700 --> 24:03.100]  King supers, King stupids.
[24:03.100 --> 24:06.380]  Then you need to mail that certified mail to where you get the thing back when they
[24:06.380 --> 24:10.180]  get it so that you get the return receipt so that you know that they have received it.
[24:10.180 --> 24:11.780]  And then you wait in the mail.
[24:11.780 --> 24:14.140]  I'm not sure how long it's taken for cards to come back right now.
[24:14.140 --> 24:16.180]  Either one of you guys know the time varies.
[24:16.180 --> 24:17.180]  It's not long.
[24:17.180 --> 24:20.140]  I hope not too long because mine is out of fucking commission right now.
[24:20.140 --> 24:21.140]  It expired yesterday.
[24:21.140 --> 24:24.380]  So I can't shop at the dispensary until it comes back.
[24:24.380 --> 24:30.900]  It's usually no more than 30 days the last year or two.
[24:30.900 --> 24:31.900]  The table went silently.
[24:31.900 --> 24:33.980]  You can't shop for 30 days, bro.
[24:33.980 --> 24:39.700]  At one point it was like an eight month wait.
[24:39.700 --> 24:40.700]  Yeah.
[24:40.700 --> 24:41.700]  At one point it was a long time.
[24:41.700 --> 24:42.700]  Yeah.
[24:42.700 --> 24:45.580]  That was back when it was a hundred to the doctor and a hundred to the state, which meant
[24:45.580 --> 24:48.940]  the state gave you a free year every time you did your card because it took us a damn
[24:48.940 --> 24:49.940]  long process.
[24:49.940 --> 24:50.940]  Yeah.
[24:50.940 --> 24:54.300]  And that was back when you could still use your temp paperwork for that whole time.
[24:54.300 --> 24:55.300]  Yeah.
[24:55.300 --> 24:56.300]  Oh, no more.
[24:56.300 --> 24:59.340]  I'm pretty sure I accepted fake paperwork when I worked at that old dispensary because
[24:59.340 --> 25:03.380]  the paperwork changed so frequently that they would show up with new stuff and I'd be like,
[25:03.380 --> 25:04.380]  it looks really right.
[25:04.380 --> 25:05.380]  I don't know.
[25:05.380 --> 25:06.380]  It's notarized.
[25:06.380 --> 25:07.380]  I was like, this shit.
[25:07.380 --> 25:08.380]  Sure.
[25:08.380 --> 25:09.380]  Go ahead.
[25:09.380 --> 25:10.380]  Shop.
[25:10.380 --> 25:11.380]  Whatever.
[25:11.380 --> 25:12.380]  Like I had, it was hard to verify now.
[25:12.380 --> 25:13.380]  Yeah.
[25:13.380 --> 25:15.820]  Now you get a purple card with a barcode on it and your name on it.
[25:15.820 --> 25:17.100]  They've changed it again.
[25:17.100 --> 25:18.100]  I heard.
[25:18.100 --> 25:20.300]  I heard we're getting a new pool card.
[25:20.660 --> 25:22.060]  I heard we're getting, because Lindsay would see firsthand.
[25:22.060 --> 25:24.500]  She checks IDs and cards all day.
[25:24.500 --> 25:25.500]  Yeah.
[25:25.500 --> 25:30.300]  It's still the purple cards, but actually now for the, uh, the certified mail stuff,
[25:30.300 --> 25:34.660]  there's a whole list of ones that like are voided and aren't real and all of that.
[25:34.660 --> 25:38.060]  So like you can, when someone comes in, there's just a quick list you have to check.
[25:38.060 --> 25:39.060]  Oh yeah.
[25:39.060 --> 25:40.060]  Of course it have expired and voided.
[25:40.060 --> 25:41.060]  Yeah.
[25:41.060 --> 25:43.900]  Well, people who have like stolen cards and stuff like that.
[25:43.900 --> 25:44.900]  Yeah.
[25:44.900 --> 25:46.660]  I have a friend, I'm not sure how much detail I can go into.
[25:46.660 --> 25:50.940]  I have a friend who is, uh, employed by a dispensary and they caught somebody stealing
[25:50.940 --> 25:53.780]  like blatantly shoplifting and they saw it.
[25:53.780 --> 25:54.780]  They saw the person do it.
[25:54.780 --> 25:55.780]  They saw it on camera.
[25:55.780 --> 25:56.780]  They went and checked the camera ball.
[25:56.780 --> 25:58.020]  The person was still in the room.
[25:58.020 --> 26:00.700]  So if they had proof, you know, they didn't make a false accusation.
[26:00.700 --> 26:04.140]  They walked outside and they said, Mr. Customer, we've got you on camera stealing.
[26:04.140 --> 26:05.700]  Uh, can we have our product back?
[26:05.700 --> 26:06.700]  And they're like, I didn't steal shit.
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.660]  And like, okay, have a good day.
[26:08.660 --> 26:11.540]  And they just let the customer leave and they called the cops and the MED and they're like,
[26:11.540 --> 26:14.420]  Hey, revoke his card and send police there to get our product back.
[26:14.460 --> 26:18.380]  And they went and got the cops, went and got the product back and confiscated his, uh,
[26:18.380 --> 26:21.180]  MMJ card and the MED or no, not the MED.
[26:21.180 --> 26:22.180]  Cause it's not immediate.
[26:22.180 --> 26:25.980]  It's the Colorado department of public health and environment, uh, discontinued his card.
[26:25.980 --> 26:29.460]  So they took his card from him and he cannot renew.
[26:29.460 --> 26:31.060]  So don't steal from a damn dispensary.
[26:31.060 --> 26:33.020]  If you are privileged enough to go in there.
[26:33.020 --> 26:36.980]  There's a, honestly, there's a reason dispensary robberies are so infrequent.
[26:36.980 --> 26:42.300]  It's because everybody in Colorado has seen the number of cameras that are required and
[26:42.340 --> 26:45.140]  has seen the one or two reports of the dude who does rob one.
[26:45.140 --> 26:47.020]  You get arrested like an hour later.
[26:47.020 --> 26:49.940]  You get seen from 17 different angles, just walking in the place.
[26:49.940 --> 26:53.100]  You can zoom in on the camera and read the VIN number and you'll meet you.
[26:53.100 --> 26:54.660]  We had a, yeah, you really can't.
[26:54.660 --> 26:55.900]  He's not even kidding.
[26:55.900 --> 26:59.700]  We can read the VIN number on, on the inside of your car, on the dash tucked in that little
[26:59.700 --> 27:00.700]  gap.
[27:00.700 --> 27:01.820]  We can read that number with the cameras.
[27:01.820 --> 27:05.500]  I hear the security guard go, Nope, that's a cigarette.
[27:05.500 --> 27:10.260]  And he's zooming in across like the other side of the parking lot to somebody who just
[27:10.260 --> 27:11.860]  fired something up in the driver's seat.
[27:12.420 --> 27:16.380]  We had a contractor working on air conditioners the other day in the building and it's summertime
[27:16.380 --> 27:18.460]  just doing summer maintenance on the ACs and shit.
[27:18.460 --> 27:21.500]  And he walked out to the, to the truck to get a tool and put a cigarette in his mouth.
[27:21.500 --> 27:23.500]  And I go, Bri, can't have you smoking on the property.
[27:23.500 --> 27:24.500]  I'm sorry.
[27:24.500 --> 27:26.100]  And he goes, no one's going to see me, bro.
[27:26.100 --> 27:29.620]  And I go, if you look around, there's cameras on the outside of the building every eight
[27:29.620 --> 27:30.620]  feet.
[27:30.620 --> 27:34.300]  And he looked up and he was like, yo man, I'm pretty sure he might've had a cigarette
[27:34.300 --> 27:35.460]  while he was up working on the air conditioner.
[27:35.460 --> 27:38.900]  Cause I could smell that shit when I was inside the grow, but there aren't any cameras up
[27:38.900 --> 27:41.180]  there, but he was up there smoking on the roof.
[27:41.180 --> 27:42.460]  I'm pretty damn sure.
[27:42.460 --> 27:43.460]  Yeah.
[27:43.460 --> 27:48.340]  It's people like, I see people like trying to put out blunts pulling in all the time.
[27:48.340 --> 27:49.700]  I'm like, are you crazy?
[27:49.700 --> 27:52.540]  I'm like, oh, remind me to tell you a story off there.
[27:52.540 --> 27:57.420]  I don't know if I want to, well, no, I have to tell the new employees, like I remind every
[27:57.420 --> 28:00.220]  employee the first couple times that they're working.
[28:00.220 --> 28:03.420]  Like, just remember that you're always on camera.
[28:03.420 --> 28:06.300]  Always go to pick your ass.
[28:06.300 --> 28:10.340]  Like it's recorded in HD for prosperity for all time.
[28:11.300 --> 28:11.820]  Yeah.
[28:11.820 --> 28:15.180]  And the people are watching these cameras.
[28:15.180 --> 28:18.820]  Like it's not like nobody's watching these cameras and oh, it doesn't even matter.
[28:18.820 --> 28:21.100]  They're just there for show and they're just there.
[28:21.100 --> 28:24.340]  If something bad happens, like people are always watching those cameras.
[28:24.340 --> 28:25.860]  They're always reviewing it.
[28:25.860 --> 28:27.420]  We have weird things happen.
[28:27.420 --> 28:31.660]  Our grow is not in the best part of town and it's at the end of a street where you could
[28:31.660 --> 28:34.640]  do whatever you want because honestly it's at the end of the street, there's nothing
[28:34.640 --> 28:35.640]  else down there.
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.320]  So nobody travels that direction unless they're coming to our grow to do some stupid shit.
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.120]  And oftentimes I'll find parts of the gate, like they'll have unscrewed all of the bolts
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.960]  on the gate, but they use the types of bolts to where the nuts won't come off the end of
[28:49.960 --> 28:50.960]  the bolt.
[28:50.960 --> 28:53.960]  They took the end of the bolt and flattened it like after it was so now you can only unscrew
[28:53.960 --> 28:54.960]  it so far.
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.080]  You'll get that bracket really well on done, but you can't get it off still.
[28:58.080 --> 29:01.480]  And they're trying to get our gate open because our gates barbed wire to the cross three layers
[29:01.480 --> 29:03.080]  of fucking barbed wire across the top.
[29:03.080 --> 29:04.360]  So you can't get in through that.
[29:04.360 --> 29:08.560]  So they're trying to just get it open and shit like that happens every other day.
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.120]  They threw carpets over the barbed wire and climbed the fence and then we had locked trash
[29:14.120 --> 29:18.560]  cans and they climbed up on high shit and jumped like body slammed through the trash
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.480]  can lids to get to our trash and there wasn't even anything good in there.
[29:23.480 --> 29:28.100]  There was actually an exploded bag of compound putty that I'd thrown away.
[29:28.100 --> 29:31.760]  So whoever jumped in there that night was covered in compound putty, fucking funny.
[29:31.760 --> 29:36.520]  Cause there's a footprint going to the fucking, but then they had to climb back over that
[29:36.520 --> 29:41.240]  gate with their carpets and covered in compound putties and get in their car and drive away.
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.880]  But we've got footage of all of that shit.
[29:43.880 --> 29:48.560]  And every time we see it, we've got a thing, the camera lights up or the video lights up
[29:48.560 --> 29:52.000]  red if there's no action on the camera and then it lights up green dots every time there's
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  movement.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.120]  So we can just go scroll right to the green and be like, Oh look, there's that dipshit
[29:55.120 --> 29:56.120]  on camera one.
[29:56.120 --> 30:00.040]  There is a camera 16 there is on camera eight and to see him from all angles doing stupid
[30:00.040 --> 30:01.040]  shit.
[30:01.040 --> 30:03.320]  So people do see all of that footage that happens.
[30:03.320 --> 30:04.320]  Everything.
[30:04.320 --> 30:07.960]  And even if we're randomly looking for one time, we lost something in the grow.
[30:07.960 --> 30:09.440]  We're like, where the fuck did it go?
[30:09.440 --> 30:10.680]  We couldn't find where something went.
[30:10.680 --> 30:14.560]  We just totally found where it started and then just watched it on the camera, watched
[30:14.560 --> 30:16.160]  where it traveled through a couple of days.
[30:16.160 --> 30:18.840]  And then we're like, Oh, it's up on this top shelf where nobody can even see it.
[30:18.840 --> 30:21.280]  Now it is right up here and just went and grabbed it.
[30:21.280 --> 30:24.200]  And who knows what other shit we may have seen if we would have paid attention to that
[30:24.200 --> 30:25.200]  video.
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.200]  Cause we were around like an entire day.
[30:26.200 --> 30:31.280]  There'll be people scratching their balls, picking their noses, picking their asses.
[30:31.280 --> 30:36.120]  We have people, somebody will walk out to their car and notice it's been dinged.
[30:36.120 --> 30:40.560]  And five minutes later they're on the phone with PD like, yeah, my car was hit in the
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.800]  my work parking lot today.
[30:41.800 --> 30:42.800]  I know who did.
[30:42.800 --> 30:43.800]  We've got the license plate on video.
[30:43.800 --> 30:44.800]  Yep.
[30:44.800 --> 30:46.360]  Everything's on everything, not just dispensaries guys.
[30:46.360 --> 30:47.360]  Everything's on camera now.
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.360]  Be careful.
[30:48.360 --> 30:49.360]  Yep.
[30:49.360 --> 30:50.360]  Be careful.
[30:50.360 --> 30:51.680]  If you're out there smoking, you're out there doing whatever you're doing.
[30:51.680 --> 30:52.680]  You're on camera.
[30:52.680 --> 30:54.120]  Be aware of your surroundings.
[30:54.120 --> 30:57.120]  It's there's people everywhere and they don't all like us.
[30:57.120 --> 30:58.960]  A lot of them do not like us.
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.960]  Some people don't like falafel.
[30:59.960 --> 31:00.960]  I mean, yeah.
[31:01.640 --> 31:06.160]  We didn't talk about that on the air, but, um, I parked somewhere and somebody accused
[31:06.160 --> 31:09.120]  me of consuming cannabis while I was eating a sandwich.
[31:09.120 --> 31:12.560]  It's not illegal to have, you can't do that here and have lunch at the same time.
[31:12.560 --> 31:14.040]  I'm eating a falafel.
[31:14.040 --> 31:15.040]  It's fucking good.
[31:15.040 --> 31:16.040]  You want some?
[31:16.040 --> 31:17.040]  You mad boo?
[31:17.040 --> 31:18.040]  Free the falafel.
[31:18.040 --> 31:19.040]  Yes.
[31:19.040 --> 31:20.040]  Free the falafel.
[31:20.040 --> 31:22.160]  All right, you guys, we've been going for like 30 minutes.
[31:22.160 --> 31:24.160]  People only like to listen to 36 minute podcasts.
[31:24.160 --> 31:25.160]  Yeah.
[31:25.160 --> 31:26.160]  Listen longer.
[31:26.160 --> 31:27.160]  Yeah.
[31:27.160 --> 31:28.160]  I don't know why.
[31:28.160 --> 31:29.160]  36 minutes is the prime number for us.
[31:29.160 --> 31:30.160]  They like it when we ramble.
[31:30.360 --> 31:31.360]  They like it when we ramble.
[31:31.360 --> 31:36.280]  Um, does, uh, do you guys have anything you'd like to bring to the table for this fine podcast?
[31:36.280 --> 31:37.440]  Make sure you're registered to vote.
[31:37.440 --> 31:38.440]  Yes.
[31:38.440 --> 31:39.440]  I think we covered that on the last one.
[31:39.440 --> 31:40.440]  Um, covering it again.
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.600]  So I want to give a shout out.
[31:41.600 --> 31:43.000]  I don't have the listener's name.
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.720]  I should push pause, press pause and go search through my Facebook messages.
[31:47.720 --> 31:50.480]  But there was a listener who mentioned Gary Johnson in the past.
[31:50.480 --> 31:51.480]  Remember this?
[31:51.480 --> 31:53.280]  And suddenly dude is getting popular.
[31:53.280 --> 31:59.520]  Um, there are a lot of people that are dissatisfied with the current candidates and Gary's getting
[31:59.880 --> 32:00.880]  a little bit of traction.
[32:00.880 --> 32:02.000]  He was on one of my favorite podcasts.
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.000]  I think he was on the Nerdist.
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  I think he was on Nerdist podcast.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.320]  He was on one of the good ones that I listened to.
[32:06.320 --> 32:07.320]  It might've been on Joe Rogan.
[32:07.320 --> 32:08.320]  That wouldn't surprise me.
[32:08.320 --> 32:09.320]  I can't remember.
[32:09.320 --> 32:10.320]  I should see.
[32:10.320 --> 32:13.880]  I should press pause and do some research right now, but I should find the kind of listener
[32:13.880 --> 32:16.080]  who introduced us to Gary Johnson or I should go.
[32:16.080 --> 32:19.200]  I think it was Joe Rogan, but Gary Johnson was on a podcast recently.
[32:19.200 --> 32:20.200]  And the dude makes sense.
[32:20.200 --> 32:21.560]  I've known Gary for a long time.
[32:21.560 --> 32:24.240]  He seemed to me, he didn't give politician answers.
[32:24.240 --> 32:25.480]  They'd be like, Hey, what's two plus two?
[32:25.480 --> 32:29.120]  And he wouldn't go, well, I really think like 4.3 would look good.
[32:29.720 --> 32:30.720]  He would be like 4.
[32:30.720 --> 32:31.720]  2 and 2 is 4.
[32:31.720 --> 32:32.720]  Like he was straight up about shit.
[32:32.720 --> 32:34.400]  That's how I feel like politicians do it.
[32:34.400 --> 32:36.160]  Like, what's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
[32:36.160 --> 32:39.720]  And a politician's like, well, I really feel like cake is the way to go in 2017.
[32:39.720 --> 32:41.520]  They're like, all right, motherfucker.
[32:41.520 --> 32:43.160]  What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
[32:43.160 --> 32:46.000]  Well, you see, pie has always been my favorite.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.160]  That's what you get from most politicians, in my opinion.
[32:48.160 --> 32:55.680]  I'm a big Gary Johnson fan and he's very much pro medical marijuana, pro marijuana legalization,
[32:55.680 --> 32:58.120]  pro ending the drug war.
[32:58.120 --> 33:01.280]  But I don't think he's a viable candidate.
[33:01.280 --> 33:03.280]  Some of his money plans are a little goofy.
[33:03.280 --> 33:07.760]  All right, we're not going to go too political here on the show.
[33:07.760 --> 33:09.520]  Gary Johnson's economic plans.
[33:09.520 --> 33:12.880]  But the dude came out of nowhere and one of our listeners kind of predicted that shit.
[33:12.880 --> 33:13.880]  So shout out to our listener.
[33:13.880 --> 33:14.880]  Thanks for paying attention for us.
[33:14.880 --> 33:16.440]  Thanks for making me aware of the guy.
[33:16.440 --> 33:19.480]  Cause I, uh, the second time I heard about him was on, I'm pretty sure it was the Joe
[33:19.480 --> 33:20.480]  Rogan experience podcast.
[33:20.480 --> 33:22.320]  Shout out to Joe Rogan for doing that thing.
[33:22.320 --> 33:24.480]  That dude's on like 800 and something fucking episodes.
[33:24.480 --> 33:25.480]  Yeah.
[33:25.480 --> 33:27.800]  Him and Chris Hardwick are leading that shit forever.
[33:28.480 --> 33:29.480]  Well, they started it forever.
[33:29.480 --> 33:33.760]  I think Corolla might get some credit for starting it, but I don't know who really started
[33:33.760 --> 33:36.600]  it, but I know Corolla is up there too.
[33:36.600 --> 33:38.720]  Those are some of the podcasting heroes, I guess.
[33:38.720 --> 33:39.720]  All right.
[33:39.720 --> 33:41.520]  I'm looking forward to seeing what Gary does with the rest of the year.
[33:41.520 --> 33:42.520]  That's for sure.
[33:42.520 --> 33:44.440]  I want to see what the rest of everything does.
[33:44.440 --> 33:46.720]  And what the fuck is happening in Canada?
[33:46.720 --> 33:48.560]  They're like, Oh, we're going to legalize cannabis.
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.720]  And then what, why are the fucking Royal Canadian mounted police raiding dispensaries in Canada
[33:53.720 --> 33:55.760]  now that cannabis is legal?
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.320]  People kind of jumped the gun.
[33:57.840 --> 33:58.840]  Yeah.
[33:58.840 --> 33:59.840]  Okay.
[33:59.840 --> 34:00.840]  That makes sense.
[34:00.840 --> 34:01.840]  It sucks.
[34:01.840 --> 34:04.720]  And I really don't agree with what the authorities did.
[34:04.720 --> 34:08.560]  But at the same time, if you didn't see it coming, you're blind, deaf, and we're watching
[34:08.560 --> 34:09.560]  something else.
[34:09.560 --> 34:14.040]  They've been saying for weeks that you can't do this.
[34:14.040 --> 34:15.120]  It's not legal yet.
[34:15.120 --> 34:17.200]  The rules haven't been passed.
[34:17.200 --> 34:23.640]  They haven't figured out zoning or hours of operation or taxes or none of that shit yet.
[34:24.640 --> 34:27.280]  You're just slowing down the movement by jumping the gun.
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.240]  I think they've decided on the legal age of 24 is what consumption age is going to be
[34:31.240 --> 34:32.240]  in Canada.
[34:32.240 --> 34:33.240]  That's interesting.
[34:33.240 --> 34:38.640]  I listened to a guy with the Canadian podcast and I think he was saying that 24 is what
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.360]  they were discussing last time.
[34:42.360 --> 34:44.400]  It's a little old in my mind.
[34:44.400 --> 34:45.400]  Yeah.
[34:45.400 --> 34:46.400]  Yeah.
[34:46.400 --> 34:49.120]  It should be closer to 18 in my opinion, but 21 is cool.
[34:49.120 --> 34:50.120]  Yeah.
[34:50.120 --> 34:52.160]  I think I have to go with 21 unfortunately.
[34:52.160 --> 34:55.200]  I've got a daughter who's creeping up on 18.
[34:55.200 --> 34:57.440]  If she came up to me right now and she's like, Hey dad, can I get a dab?
[34:57.440 --> 34:59.400]  I'd be like, well, you got to smoke some flower first.
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.840]  But I mean, like I'd probably, if she wanted to sit down with us and smoke, I would not
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.560]  tell her no because I'd rather her sit down and puff with us than run off with her little
[35:07.560 --> 35:09.120]  girl friends and smoke.
[35:09.120 --> 35:10.120]  True.
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.720]  Well here in Colorado, if you're under like between 18 and 21 and have a medical condition,
[35:14.720 --> 35:15.720]  you can get a card, right?
[35:15.720 --> 35:17.880]  My daughter has no interest in smoking cannabis anyway.
[35:17.880 --> 35:19.520]  I'm just putting that out there.
[35:19.520 --> 35:21.360]  My 12 year old girl has zero.
[35:21.560 --> 35:23.000]  She thinks it smells stupid is what she said.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.640]  I just did this with my niece.
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.120]  I'm about to do it again with my nephew and I've got a kid who's like almost one.
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.080]  So I'm going to be doing it again in a few years.
[35:31.080 --> 35:35.200]  So like somewhere between 18 and 21 works for me.
[35:35.200 --> 35:41.440]  I kind of like the idea of a much safer, gentler, intoxicant being legal before alcohol.
[35:41.440 --> 35:42.440]  Yeah, for sure.
[35:42.440 --> 35:45.440]  Kind of like some training wheels before you just push the little fucker down the hill
[35:45.440 --> 35:46.440]  on his bike.
[35:46.440 --> 35:47.440]  Right.
[35:47.440 --> 35:50.320]  Or are you referring to your own kid as that little fucker?
[35:50.320 --> 35:51.320]  Probably.
[35:51.320 --> 35:55.520]  I'm so tired right now because he likes to cry when I sleep.
[35:55.520 --> 35:56.520]  They do that, bro.
[35:56.520 --> 35:57.520]  Yeah.
[35:57.520 --> 35:58.520]  Birth control people.
[35:58.520 --> 35:59.520]  It's a thing.
[35:59.520 --> 36:00.520]  You should practice with it.
[36:00.520 --> 36:01.520]  Don't get me wrong.
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.760]  I love my kid, but wow, you really don't want one of these when you're young.
[36:06.760 --> 36:07.760]  Get old first.
[36:07.760 --> 36:08.760]  It's easier.
[36:08.760 --> 36:09.760]  I love these podcasts.
[36:09.760 --> 36:14.280]  Hey, Jeff said all the people that tune out after half an hour tuned out everybody.
[36:14.280 --> 36:15.280]  So this awesome.
[36:15.280 --> 36:16.280]  36 minutes.

[36:20.280 --> 36:21.280]  Everyone.
[36:21.280 --> 36:22.280]  I've been really stoned.
[36:22.280 --> 36:23.280]  Plus, I mean, she showed up with like five grams of hash.
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.280]  It was like, who wants to dance?
[36:24.280 --> 36:25.280]  Is there anything you'd like to talk about on the show tonight?
[36:25.280 --> 36:26.280]  Would you like to take a minute?
[36:26.280 --> 36:27.280]  Oh my God.
[36:27.280 --> 36:28.280]  You'd like to bring to the table?
[36:28.280 --> 36:29.280]  Not at all.
[36:29.280 --> 36:30.280]  Blushing.
[36:30.280 --> 36:31.280]  We should.
[36:31.280 --> 36:32.280]  You and I should give a shout out to Hunt and Amy.
[36:32.280 --> 36:33.280]  The rest of the green and healthy wellness crew.
[36:33.280 --> 36:34.280]  Because I thought Amy put the party together.
[36:34.280 --> 36:35.280]  Turns out Joe put the party together and then hunts the boss.
[36:35.280 --> 36:36.280]  So shout out to everybody that put the party together.
[36:36.280 --> 36:37.280]  I'm going to go ahead and get the rest of the green and healthy wellness crew.
[36:37.280 --> 36:38.280]  I'm going to go ahead and get the rest of the green and healthy wellness crew.
[36:38.320 --> 36:59.320]  We got to do that.
[36:59.320 --> 37:01.220]  The boss took us out to dinner afterward.
[37:01.220 --> 37:04.480]  We got to go to the old rabbit hole and get some good ass food.
[37:04.480 --> 37:05.480]  That was insane.
[37:05.480 --> 37:11.080]  Once your food was delivered you went fucking silent. She was like food shut up
[37:12.800 --> 37:16.860]  Social media stuff from this event so I don't blame her for being baked and tearing into food
[37:16.860 --> 37:20.880]  Oh, we got we got plenty baked the boss showed up and passed out edibles. He's like, thank you for coming
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.420]  Thank you for coming here your edibles here and he looked at me and he's like here's lots of edibles for you
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.360]  Kind of fucked me up a little bit. It's nice. But uh, the rabbit hole was a good-ass time the boys ate
[37:31.840 --> 37:36.520]  Well, not just the boys the boys and a young lady because Amy was involved in that
[37:37.240 --> 37:39.280]  They ate a thing called the butcher's block
[37:39.280 --> 37:45.560]  Which is pretty much a big slab of wood with one of every animal you can imagine cooked beautifully
[37:45.560 --> 37:48.940]  I'm a vegetarian and I was looking at it like that is beautiful
[37:48.940 --> 37:53.520]  Like whoever did this is a fucking artist like they did a really good job on that
[37:53.520 --> 37:58.560]  I'm not hateful to people who consume meat because I'm a vegetarian. I'm not that guy eat your stuff
[37:58.560 --> 38:01.680]  Do it put it way in your mouth, whatever you want. I just don't want to eat any of that crap, you know
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.280]  But that stuff was beautiful. There was a cherry. What was it? Cherry braised?
[38:07.320 --> 38:11.280]  Oh, I'm back rib. It's like pork ribs or something like that
[38:12.280 --> 38:16.440]  Whatever it was it looked it was picturesque. I was like, let's take some Food Network shit right there
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.080]  They did a really good job. So shout out to the whole crew. Thanks hunt for taking us out to dinner
[38:20.080 --> 38:23.720]  Thanks, Joe and Amy for putting the party together. What was the name of the place where we smoked ABS?
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.600]  Studio a 64 shout out to that place for letting us go in there and take some dabs is a cool atmosphere
[38:29.400 --> 38:30.280]  It's kind of weird
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.360]  it's like an old bar that they just cleaned out and where there used to be beer bottles now there are bongs and
[38:35.040 --> 38:38.580]  There's been some fun reporting on because isn't there another consumption club?
[38:38.580 --> 38:43.520]  Like there's 64 then there's like a different kind of store and then there's another
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.000]  Smoke shop. Well, there's smoke club. Isn't there there's store 64
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.840]  Which is like a dispensary which is across the street from green right mids
[38:57.040 --> 38:59.040]  And then there's
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.560]  Yeah, whatever yeah, we went dad. Yeah, I might be thinking of a shop or a smoke club with a very similar name
[39:05.760 --> 39:10.320]  Maybe I'm not sure to be honest with you. I only really go to Canada. Yeah
[39:10.320 --> 39:10.640]  No
[39:10.640 --> 39:17.400]  There's your outfit has either the the acronym THC or the amendment a 64 working with the title
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  I look for the next one on the block
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.160]  Not to be too big of a dick. It's just easier to avoid the I had a mediocre
[39:25.680 --> 39:30.060]  Corporate brain fart one day in business school and then open a dispensary places that way
[39:32.040 --> 39:34.300]  So I didn't just bitch slap like 30
