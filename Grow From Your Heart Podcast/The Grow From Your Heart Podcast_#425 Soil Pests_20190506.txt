[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  All right, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.600 --> 00:06.480]  It is time for episode 425 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.480 --> 00:07.640]  Thank you for joining me.
[00:07.640 --> 00:11.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:11.000 --> 00:15.040]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:15.040 --> 00:21.640]  You can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:21.640 --> 00:25.480]  You guys know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.480 --> 00:30.760]  Today I've been taking dabs of George Washington OG Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:30.760 --> 00:39.760]  The label says this product contains 69.9% THC, 0% CBD, and 84.3% total cannabinoids.
[00:39.760 --> 00:44.800]  I'm going to crack the jar open and give it a fresh smell.
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.640]  Right when I open it, the first thing to hit my face is a pungent, gassy, fuely sort of
[00:49.640 --> 00:50.640]  aroma.
[00:50.640 --> 00:54.160]  I'm getting it closer to my face now, give it a real smell.
[00:54.160 --> 00:58.480]  The second smell that comes in is sort of a banana type of aroma.
[00:58.480 --> 01:02.960]  It almost smells as if I took banana runs and soaked them in gasoline.
[01:02.960 --> 01:06.240]  There's also a sweetness at the end, maybe a bit of earthiness.
[01:06.240 --> 01:11.080]  I really like the unique flavor from the George Washington OG Ambrosia from our friends at
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.600]  Apothecary Farms.
[01:12.600 --> 01:16.080]  I picked up this concentrate at the Pueblo location on the medical side.
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.800]  They've got a recreational and a medical dispensary in the same building.
[01:19.800 --> 01:22.920]  So again, big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:23.680 --> 01:27.200]  In this episode, I am going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.740]  Before we get there, let's cover a few shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:31.740 --> 01:34.560]  As always, I owe a big shout out to my friend, Miss Melville.
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.440]  Also, a big shout out to Tommy, a giant shout out to Paul T, as always a giant shout out
[01:39.440 --> 01:40.560]  to my buddy Aldridge.
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.960]  Again, another giant shout out to my friend, Matthew KW, and of course, a giant Dude Grows
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.680]  Crew and a Grow From Your Heart podcast, and an iRi Army shout out to my friend, Stabby
[01:50.680 --> 01:51.680]  McStabberson.
[01:52.240 --> 01:57.120]  Big thanks and much respect for all the support to everybody who helps out on Patreon.
[01:57.120 --> 02:01.960]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[02:01.960 --> 02:03.880]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:03.880 --> 02:07.920]  All the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.680]  Before we get into the email portion of this episode, I want to give a giant thank you
[02:11.680 --> 02:13.840]  and a shout out to a couple of friends of mine.
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.440]  I owe a big thank you and a big shout out to my friends, JR Token and Q Grows.
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.480]  JR Token and Q Grows are heavily involved in the creation of a new application called
[02:23.480 --> 02:24.480]  Canibuzz.
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.640]  Canibuzz is a social media application aimed at the cannabis community.
[02:28.640 --> 02:30.800]  They are cannabis friendly.
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.360]  They encourage and appreciate you posting cannabis related material on their social
[02:36.360 --> 02:37.360]  media platform.
[02:37.360 --> 02:42.280]  So join me and my friends, Q Grows and JR Token, and a whole bunch of the other iRi
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.200]  Army and Dude Grows Crew members over at Canibuzz.
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.440]  It's a free app.
[02:47.440 --> 02:52.240]  It works just like most social media applications, except it is cannabis friendly and you don't
[02:52.240 --> 02:57.920]  have to worry about your account getting deleted because you are posting cannabis related content.
[02:57.920 --> 02:59.400]  So join me over there on Canibuzz.
[02:59.400 --> 03:01.720]  I'm iRi underscore genetics on Canibuzz.
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.360]  I am still on Instagram, but you never know.
[03:04.360 --> 03:06.720]  Instagram has been deleting cannabis accounts.
[03:06.720 --> 03:08.560]  They took down my account for a little while.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  I was lucky.
[03:09.560 --> 03:11.020]  I was blessed enough to get that back.
[03:11.020 --> 03:15.160]  If it does disappear, I will not disappear from Canibuzz.
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.160]  Big shout out once again to our friends, Q Grows, JR Token, and again, a big shout
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.100]  out to everybody who's been interacting with me and following me over there on the new
[03:23.100 --> 03:24.100]  app Canibuzz.
[03:24.100 --> 03:28.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, activists and
[03:28.840 --> 03:31.300]  DAB cadets, I don't know what I'm saying anymore.
[03:31.300 --> 03:32.300]  This is a lot of fun.
[03:32.300 --> 03:36.280]  Let's get into the email portion of this podcast.
[03:36.280 --> 03:39.160]  I do enjoy creating listener generated content.
[03:39.160 --> 03:42.320]  Reading your email on the show, answering your question, lets me know that I am at least
[03:42.320 --> 03:43.320]  helping one person.
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.200]  I feel like if one person has this question, there are probably several people out there
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.640]  with this question, or maybe I can at least spark some ideas or prevent some future problems
[03:51.640 --> 03:55.280]  in people's grows by reading listener generated content.
[03:55.280 --> 03:59.320]  If you've got a question, if you've got a cannabis culture, a cannabis cultivation,
[03:59.320 --> 04:05.440]  any sort of a cannabis community related question, please send it to me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:05.440 --> 04:08.800]  Maybe I will work your question into a future episode.
[04:08.800 --> 04:11.760]  The first email in this episode goes a lot like this.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.680]  It says, Rasta Jeff, what's up?
[04:13.680 --> 04:16.840]  I am one of your podcast listeners from down here in North Carolina.
[04:16.840 --> 04:18.720]  Hey, what's up in North Carolina?
[04:18.720 --> 04:20.520]  Thank you for listening to the show.
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.520]  It says, I have recently ran into an issue in my garden and I do not really know what
[04:24.520 --> 04:25.880]  I should do.
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.560]  To give some backstory, I have a small indoor setup, so we're growing indoor.
[04:29.560 --> 04:30.920]  That's a good start.
[04:30.920 --> 04:31.920]  The message goes on.
[04:31.920 --> 04:35.200]  He says, I have an area all set up for my clones and seedlings.
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.080]  I have a two by four veg tent and I have a four by four flowering tent.
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.000]  It sounds like you have a nice little setup.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.160]  So far, everything makes sense.
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.880]  He says, up until recently, I have never had any bug issues at all in my garden.
[04:47.880 --> 04:51.520]  I just cropped my last run and had absolutely no bugs.
[04:51.520 --> 04:56.320]  With that being said, I of course had to do some transplanting to get my next run ready.
[04:56.320 --> 05:01.600]  I always do a deep clean when I reset my garden on every single surface in the room.
[05:01.600 --> 05:07.480]  Then I take just regular indoor outdoor bug spray and just spray along the walls and windows.
[05:07.480 --> 05:09.760]  Whether that works or not, I do not know.
[05:09.760 --> 05:11.440]  It is just a habit.
[05:11.440 --> 05:15.000]  So it sounds like you just harvested, you have cleaned up the room properly.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.040]  It sounds like you clean every surface in the room.
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.880]  Then it says you take some indoor outdoor bug spray and spray it along the walls and
[05:20.880 --> 05:21.880]  windows.
[05:21.880 --> 05:25.660]  I don't know that that's doing anything or if it's necessary, but it probably just feels
[05:25.660 --> 05:27.280]  good to know that you've done that.
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.320]  It really depends on what product you used, what type of pesticide you were applying,
[05:31.320 --> 05:33.580]  if that's going to do anything at all.
[05:33.580 --> 05:35.080]  Probably not to tell you the truth.
[05:35.080 --> 05:37.200]  So let's continue with the email because there is more.
[05:37.200 --> 05:40.240]  It says, fast forward to my transplant day.
[05:40.240 --> 05:42.520]  I popped a few new beans for a new run.
[05:42.520 --> 05:46.360]  I had just finished cropping, so it was time to move my veg into my flower tent and my
[05:46.360 --> 05:49.320]  new seedlings needed to go into solo cups.
[05:49.320 --> 05:50.920]  So far I'm following you.
[05:50.920 --> 05:55.580]  For soil, I like to use Fox Farm with their Fox Farm soil conditioner.
[05:55.580 --> 05:59.920]  I store my soil in three different large Rubbermaid containers.
[05:59.920 --> 06:02.680]  I store the soil in the bag in the container.
[06:02.680 --> 06:06.920]  I also store the conditioner in the bag in the container and I have one container with
[06:06.920 --> 06:09.240]  already mixed product ready to go.
[06:09.240 --> 06:10.240]  So this makes sense.
[06:10.240 --> 06:13.460]  So far, you've got some big Rubbermaid totes, you've got that for storage, and then you've
[06:13.460 --> 06:15.920]  got one that's mixed up ready to go for when you need it.
[06:15.920 --> 06:18.720]  I am following you along so far.
[06:18.720 --> 06:21.040]  I feel like this is where we're going to get a plot twist.
[06:21.040 --> 06:26.600]  It says, so I do my transplant into solo cups and they had no issues with that transplant.
[06:26.600 --> 06:31.200]  I came back the next day to check on them and I noticed a tiny bug crawling on the rim
[06:31.200 --> 06:32.440]  of the cup.
[06:32.480 --> 06:37.280]  So of course I freaked out and immediately quarantined my seedlings.
[06:37.280 --> 06:38.280]  That's a great move.
[06:38.280 --> 06:40.760]  Isolate the problem, put them in quarantine.
[06:40.760 --> 06:42.480]  Let's identify the problem.
[06:42.480 --> 06:46.080]  Once we know what kind of pests we have, we can work on a strategy to eradicate them.
[06:46.080 --> 06:47.760]  Let's continue with the message.
[06:47.760 --> 06:52.840]  It says, I could not for the life of me figure out how they possibly could have gotten in.
[06:52.840 --> 06:53.840]  I am very careful.
[06:53.840 --> 06:58.480]  I of course automatically assumed that they were root aphids, which was verified by my
[06:58.480 --> 07:00.760]  local hydro store from PICS.
[07:00.760 --> 07:05.840]  But I had my doubts because I could not find any of the telltale signs that they were in
[07:05.840 --> 07:07.960]  fact root aphids.
[07:07.960 --> 07:09.400]  Just a random note here.
[07:09.400 --> 07:10.400]  Aphids have tailpipes.
[07:10.400 --> 07:12.120]  Look for the tailpipes on an aphid.
[07:12.120 --> 07:15.360]  There might be a couple of people out there thinking I just lost my mind.
[07:15.360 --> 07:16.840]  No, go Google an aphid.
[07:16.840 --> 07:18.680]  The next time you see an aphid, look at an aphid.
[07:18.680 --> 07:19.680]  You will see the tailpipes.
[07:19.680 --> 07:21.160]  You'll know what I'm talking about.
[07:21.160 --> 07:23.680]  Let's continue with the message because it is starting to get long.
[07:23.680 --> 07:25.080]  I want to continue.
[07:25.080 --> 07:27.880]  It says no telltale signs they were in fact root aphids.
[07:27.880 --> 07:29.460]  Here we are under my microscope.
[07:29.460 --> 07:34.260]  To me, it looked too small to be an aphid and it looked more like a predator mite.
[07:34.260 --> 07:39.100]  After some research, I came across two predatory mites that these bugs resemble the most.
[07:39.100 --> 07:41.700]  Ooh, he used the full fancy name.
[07:41.700 --> 07:46.180]  The first predator he listed that he thinks this could possibly be is the californicus.
[07:46.180 --> 07:48.580]  The second one that he listed was the phyllacis.
[07:48.580 --> 07:52.740]  Yes, I did avoid using the full Greek species name.
[07:52.740 --> 07:55.300]  Nobody wants to listen to me stumble through that.
[07:55.300 --> 07:57.380]  Now it sounds like we have identified the pests.
[07:57.380 --> 07:59.140]  We don't have to worry about them being aphids.
[07:59.820 --> 08:01.300]  They're not in there sucking juices out of our plants.
[08:01.300 --> 08:03.460]  They're not in there potentially spreading disease.
[08:03.460 --> 08:08.660]  We have hopefully identified them correctly and we have got what can be beneficial predatory
[08:08.660 --> 08:10.100]  mites in the garden.
[08:10.100 --> 08:11.700]  These should not be problematic.
[08:11.700 --> 08:12.900]  There is more to the message.
[08:12.900 --> 08:14.340]  Let's keep reading.
[08:14.340 --> 08:19.340]  It says I could not figure out how I got them or where they came from because I hadn't brought
[08:19.340 --> 08:25.080]  anything new into my garden for quite some time and the soil I had was not recently brought
[08:25.080 --> 08:26.500]  into my grow.
[08:26.500 --> 08:31.540]  So I just got the idea maybe I should check my soil containers just to see and there it
[08:31.540 --> 08:32.900]  was.
[08:32.900 --> 08:39.440]  They had infested all three of my soil storage containers I use for soil and mix.
[08:39.440 --> 08:43.220]  So I got to thinking that they could not be root aphids because the soil in which they
[08:43.220 --> 08:46.740]  are living has not had plants or roots growing in it.
[08:46.740 --> 08:48.420]  Is this correct thinking?
[08:48.420 --> 08:53.320]  I would like to say that is correct thinking but there could be some organic matter in
[08:53.320 --> 08:58.840]  that medium that the bugs are still surviving off of for a short period of time.
[08:58.840 --> 09:01.300]  But so far it sounds like you have correctly identified them.
[09:01.300 --> 09:03.080]  You sound like a smart person.
[09:03.080 --> 09:04.420]  You are making a soil mix.
[09:04.420 --> 09:06.440]  You are smart enough to investigate.
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.160]  You also had a microscope which makes me think you're probably an intelligent person.
[09:11.160 --> 09:13.880]  Most average people don't have a microscope laying around.
[09:13.880 --> 09:17.680]  So if you've got one that you had access to that easily, you're probably somebody who
[09:17.680 --> 09:22.260]  is interested in higher education, somebody who is interested in advanced thinking.
[09:22.260 --> 09:26.420]  So I'm going to trust that you can open a book and identify an insect based on what
[09:26.420 --> 09:28.220]  you have seen in your microscope.
[09:28.220 --> 09:32.100]  So I'm going to believe you that these are not root aphids and they're sucking the juices
[09:32.100 --> 09:35.560]  out of your plant, potentially spreading diseases in your garden.
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.700]  I'm going to believe you.
[09:36.700 --> 09:37.780]  I'm going to agree with you.
[09:37.780 --> 09:41.500]  I'm going to have faith in your identification that those are not aphids.
[09:41.500 --> 09:45.820]  We are going to agree and move forward acting like those are predatory mites.
[09:45.820 --> 09:46.820]  So let's continue.
[09:46.820 --> 09:51.700]  It says, I have a very specific pest management program which I created after listening to
[09:52.140 --> 09:55.980]  you, which makes this very difficult to understand how this happened.
[09:55.980 --> 10:00.580]  I did have a small fungus gnat problem and I thought that may have attracted them, but
[10:00.580 --> 10:06.620]  then that wouldn't explain how or why they got into my soil that was sealed in containers.
[10:06.620 --> 10:11.020]  The fungus gnat problem and this problem were different problems, but I'm going to assume
[10:11.020 --> 10:13.740]  they were possibly caused by the same source.
[10:13.740 --> 10:15.620]  We will talk about that in just a moment.
[10:15.620 --> 10:20.380]  He wraps up and says, after all of that, I of course do what I always do and scroll through
[10:20.380 --> 10:23.580]  your podcast to try and find a good one that would help me.
[10:23.580 --> 10:28.580]  So I listened to one you did about bugs and that podcast, you mentioned that you use predatory
[10:28.580 --> 10:30.500]  insects in flower.
[10:30.500 --> 10:34.700]  After all of my research, I have found that soil mites are supposed to be beneficial and
[10:34.700 --> 10:40.860]  only eat the larva of other insects, hunt spider mites and other non beneficial things
[10:40.860 --> 10:42.820]  living in your soil.
[10:42.820 --> 10:47.440]  But I have also seen where the population got out of control in some research I did.
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.120]  So my question is, should I just leave them and start flower?
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.960]  They do not seem to be causing any issues with my plants and they are absolutely 100%
[10:55.960 --> 11:00.920]  confined to the soil and do not crawl onto the plants and there is nothing on the undersides
[11:00.920 --> 11:02.300]  of my leaves.
[11:02.300 --> 11:06.800]  They wrap up this message by saying, please feel free to correct anything that I put in
[11:06.800 --> 11:08.400]  this email if it was incorrect.
[11:08.400 --> 11:09.640]  Hey, you did a great job.
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.280]  This is a wonderful email.
[11:11.280 --> 11:16.300]  Also it says I have never seen or heard of a bug problem such as this, so I am at a loss.
[11:16.300 --> 11:18.380]  Please help me if you can.
[11:18.380 --> 11:20.060]  I can help and I am happy to do it.
[11:20.060 --> 11:24.300]  I have got a very good explanation of what I will assume happened here.
[11:24.300 --> 11:27.240]  You can probably tell that a couple of minutes ago, my throat and my voice started doing
[11:27.240 --> 11:28.540]  a couple of funky things.
[11:28.540 --> 11:29.540]  I need a drink.
[11:29.540 --> 11:30.540]  I need a dab.
[11:30.540 --> 11:33.800]  I'm going to press pause for a couple of seconds and when I get back, we're going to talk about
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.080]  where I assume these bugs came from and what we need to do about them.
[11:38.080 --> 11:39.500]  Take a dab with me, you guys.
[11:39.500 --> 11:42.460]  All right, podcast world, through the magic of editing, I am back.
[11:42.460 --> 11:45.860]  I hope you were able to take a fat dab or take a bong rip or something delicious while
[11:45.860 --> 11:47.260]  I was taking a break.
[11:47.260 --> 11:52.100]  If you were not able to smoke something, don't worry because I took enough dabs for two or
[11:52.100 --> 11:53.100]  three people.
[11:53.100 --> 11:55.120]  Now, let's get back into this email.
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.980]  The question that I wanted to address was where do you think these bugs came from?
[12:00.980 --> 12:05.460]  I would assume that these predatory mites and your fungus gnats from before probably
[12:05.460 --> 12:07.500]  came from a very similar place.
[12:07.500 --> 12:10.580]  I'm going to assume that they came from your soil.
[12:10.580 --> 12:13.380]  I'm not going to blame Fox Farm soil specifically.
[12:13.380 --> 12:16.700]  I'm not going to say they come from any specific brand of soil.
[12:16.700 --> 12:22.460]  I'm going to say that it would probably be safe to assume that most of the soilless mix
[12:22.460 --> 12:28.420]  or soilless media or soil product purchased at a grow store or a hydro store or whatever
[12:28.420 --> 12:33.140]  type of supply store we are purchasing it from, it all comes from a warehouse.
[12:33.140 --> 12:36.860]  There are many products stored at those warehouses.
[12:36.860 --> 12:39.620]  All of the soil is stored in one area.
[12:39.660 --> 12:43.900]  Then when orders are placed, they just grab one pallet of Fox Farms, one pallet of Roots
[12:43.900 --> 12:45.940]  Organic, one pallet of Playground.
[12:45.940 --> 12:50.300]  They mix that in the truck with whatever other shit they got to put and they ship it off.
[12:50.300 --> 12:53.200]  All of the stuff is sitting in one giant area.
[12:53.200 --> 12:57.780]  If one batch of soil is delivered to that distribution center and it happens to have
[12:57.780 --> 13:03.980]  a soil-borne pest in that bag, there is a potential for that pest or that insect or
[13:03.980 --> 13:08.480]  that life form to reproduce in that environment.
[13:08.600 --> 13:10.680]  It is going to expand its environment.
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.040]  It's going to say, hey, there are a lot of us, whatever kind of pest it is, there are
[13:14.040 --> 13:17.840]  a lot of us spider mites over here in this one bag of Fox Farms dirt.
[13:17.840 --> 13:20.680]  So then they're going to say, hey, why don't a bunch of you guys go on a quest?
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.400]  Why don't you go explore and go find us some new territory, some new property?
[13:25.400 --> 13:29.760]  They put together a little spider mite expedition crew and they get their little expedition
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.720]  hats on and they get some fancy boots and some binoculars and some maps and shit.
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.680]  They go out on a quest and they leave that bag of dirt and they go try to find more area
[13:37.680 --> 13:38.760]  to populate.
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.180]  And they don't have to go far because many of the distribution facilities which work
[13:43.180 --> 13:47.520]  with these large amounts of soil, they'll have a pallet of Fox Farms sitting right next
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.240]  to a pallet of Roots Organics, sitting right next to a pallet of 707, sitting right next
[13:52.240 --> 13:54.760]  to a pallet of whatever else you were thinking about buying.
[13:54.760 --> 13:56.960]  They're all right there in the same area.
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.580]  So that little expedition crew is going to go, hey, look, there's a big pile of fresh
[14:00.580 --> 14:01.580]  stuff over there.
[14:01.580 --> 14:03.400]  And they're going to go on there and they're going to infest that.
[14:03.400 --> 14:05.960]  They're going to populate that and then repeat that process.
[14:05.960 --> 14:11.360]  So once you take something into that shipping and receiving area, that storage area, that
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.440]  distribution center, wherever it is, they're just going to move around to every bag of
[14:15.440 --> 14:16.840]  dirt.
[14:16.840 --> 14:22.000]  Then you have other places that actually sell trees and shrubs and flowers and plants and
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.040]  they also have bags of soil and all of that stuff is stored in a large backyard area.
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.800]  If you go to, there's a large grow supply chain in Colorado.
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.360]  If you go to their Colorado Springs location and you say, hey, can I get five bags of this
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.360]  type of dirt?
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.520]  They say, sure, pull up to the back and they go to the back and they've got all of the
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.720]  soil, all of the soilless mix, all the perlite, all the stuff like that is just stored out
[14:46.720 --> 14:47.720]  back.
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.360]  It is in a gate, it's out back under the rain, under the sun and their whole backyard shipping
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.840]  receiving area where the soil, soilless mixes, the perlite, the persolite, anything like
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.440]  that, it is all kept right there in the backyard.
[15:00.440 --> 15:05.240]  There's a lot of potential for life to happen and if you give life potential, it will happen,
[15:05.240 --> 15:07.800]  especially when it is an insect.
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.280]  Insects love to thrive in just the right environment, which brings me to my next part.
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.800]  I'm going to assume that you brought these bugs home in either your soil or your soil
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.200]  conditioner.
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.200]  Then you mix them up into a container and you are giving them the perfect environment.
[15:22.200 --> 15:23.760]  They are thriving in there.
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.440]  You have basically created a luxury hotel for these insects.
[15:27.440 --> 15:28.760]  They're just chilling out in there.
[15:28.760 --> 15:31.560]  They're breeding, they're repopulating, they're thriving.
[15:31.560 --> 15:35.400]  I'm really excited that this email ended up with us having predatory mites and not russet
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.720]  mites or spotted mites or something terrible that is going to devastate the garden.
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.240]  This is easy to deal with.
[15:41.240 --> 15:42.240]  We know what we've got.
[15:42.240 --> 15:43.240]  We've got predatory mites.
[15:43.240 --> 15:44.960]  We know where they came from, we assume.
[15:44.960 --> 15:47.640]  I'm going to assume, you say there's no other way they got there.
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.000]  They came in with either the soil or the soil conditioner.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.360]  You mix them up into your big Rubbermaid or Tupperware containers.
[15:54.360 --> 15:58.080]  You've got that stored somewhere where it is the perfect environment for those bugs.
[15:58.400 --> 15:59.400]  They are breeding, they are thriving.
[15:59.400 --> 16:01.360]  Now, what do we do about it?
[16:01.360 --> 16:05.200]  One thing you said earlier is that the plants are not showing you any problems.
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.440]  In a previous episode, I said that the plants are the number one indicator of what to do
[16:09.440 --> 16:10.680]  in the grow.
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.680]  If the plants are not showing you any problems, that is another indicator that these are indeed
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.880]  beneficial insects and they're not going to cause you problems in the garden.
[16:19.880 --> 16:21.600]  Let's not do anything about them.
[16:21.600 --> 16:23.280]  Let's just let them thrive.
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.840]  They will keep away other pests.
[16:24.840 --> 16:31.280]  If you've got two different types of predatory insects just naturally occurring in your environment,
[16:31.280 --> 16:33.120]  you are lucky, you are blessed.
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.640]  A lot of people, especially commercial cultivations, especially myself in a large facility late
[16:38.640 --> 16:44.480]  in flower, pay a lot of money to have these exact bugs sent to us in little packages.
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.160]  Then we pay other people to distribute them throughout the grow room.
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.720]  You got a bonus gift in your dirt, in your soil, in your soil conditioner.
[16:52.720 --> 16:54.720]  I think you got lucky.
[16:54.800 --> 16:57.680]  These could have been really terrible insects.
[16:57.680 --> 17:01.240]  My advice would be just let these insects work themselves out.
[17:01.240 --> 17:03.560]  They're not causing you any problems.
[17:03.560 --> 17:06.240]  They may actually be warding off other pests.
[17:06.240 --> 17:08.320]  They are working as a preventative at this time.
[17:08.320 --> 17:11.600]  If another bug shows up and tries to get in there, they're going to go, nah, bro, we got
[17:11.600 --> 17:12.600]  security.
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.780]  We've got this little built-in army that showed up on its own.
[17:14.780 --> 17:15.780]  We have claimed this turf.
[17:15.780 --> 17:16.780]  It is ours.
[17:16.780 --> 17:18.120]  You do not get to come in here.
[17:18.120 --> 17:21.120]  They will eat and destroy anybody that tries to come in.
[17:21.120 --> 17:22.360]  I wouldn't do anything.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.840]  They will run out of food.
[17:23.960 --> 17:28.160]  They will stop populating and eventually they may just disappear.
[17:28.160 --> 17:29.160]  They may stick around.
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.160]  I'm not sure what they're eating.
[17:30.160 --> 17:31.320]  I'm not sure what's keeping them alive.
[17:31.320 --> 17:35.760]  I'm not sure what those bugs feast off of if there is not a presence of other bugs for
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.240]  them to eat, which means once they run out of other bugs, they may just naturally die
[17:40.240 --> 17:41.240]  off.
[17:41.240 --> 17:43.080]  I wouldn't really change anything.
[17:43.080 --> 17:46.840]  If the plants look happy, if the garden is going well, I would keep doing just as you
[17:46.840 --> 17:47.840]  were doing.
[17:47.840 --> 17:50.860]  Like I've said in a previous episode, the plants are the number one indicator.
[17:50.860 --> 17:52.620]  The plants will let you know if they're under stress.
[17:52.620 --> 17:54.300]  The plants will let you know if they have problems.
[17:54.300 --> 17:57.220]  The plants will let you know when it is time to make adjustments.
[17:57.220 --> 18:01.340]  As long as you are confident that you have correctly identified these insects and as
[18:01.340 --> 18:05.440]  long as those plants are not showing you any signs of distress, I would continue to do
[18:05.440 --> 18:06.860]  business as usual.
[18:06.860 --> 18:08.620]  It sounds like you've got a great setup.
[18:08.620 --> 18:10.480]  It sounds like you've thought it out quite well.
[18:10.480 --> 18:13.340]  It sounds like you are quite a smart person.
[18:13.340 --> 18:17.840]  Keep going as long as you are certain that you have identified that insect correctly.
[18:17.840 --> 18:23.200]  If you need help identifying that insect, I would contact Susan Wainwright-Evans.
[18:23.200 --> 18:24.680]  She is known as the bug lady.
[18:24.680 --> 18:30.840]  If you can get a quality photo of that bug, she can most likely identify that insect on
[18:30.840 --> 18:31.840]  site.
[18:31.840 --> 18:32.840]  She is a genius.
[18:32.840 --> 18:33.840]  She is amazing.
[18:33.840 --> 18:36.440]  She is passionate about insects.
[18:36.440 --> 18:40.960]  Check out Susan Wainwright-Evans if you need more guidance on pests and identifying the
[18:40.960 --> 18:43.120]  bug that is in your garden.
[18:43.120 --> 18:44.640]  I want to thank you for the great email.
[18:44.640 --> 18:49.040]  I'm sure there are several people out there who have gotten bug problems from products
[18:49.040 --> 18:53.800]  that they have purchased from a grow store or a hydroponic supply store or a farm store
[18:53.800 --> 18:56.520]  or perhaps maybe even a big chain store.
[18:56.520 --> 19:00.020]  Wherever they've gotten it, I'm sure people have gotten problems and they weren't even
[19:00.020 --> 19:02.600]  aware that there was a problem in that soil.
[19:02.600 --> 19:03.760]  That is something to think about.
[19:03.760 --> 19:08.600]  Pay attention to the soil or whatever soil is mixed or whatever medium you are purchasing.
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.640]  When you do your first pot into that soil, pay attention.
[19:11.640 --> 19:12.640]  Tap the bag.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.920]  See if something flies out of it.
[19:13.920 --> 19:17.240]  If you've got a microscope, go ahead and check out some of that soil and see if anything
[19:17.240 --> 19:18.960]  is crawling around.
[19:18.960 --> 19:22.600]  It is really easy to treat for pests if we identify them early.
[19:22.600 --> 19:26.160]  Once they get out of control, it becomes harder and more challenging.
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.320]  The more pests there are, the worse the infestation gets, the more challenging it is to break
[19:30.320 --> 19:31.320]  the cycle.
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.760]  So again, I'm going to suggest that you start paying close attention to everything that
[19:34.760 --> 19:36.340]  you bring into your grow.
[19:36.340 --> 19:41.160]  Start looking at every bag of medium, every bag of perlite, every bag of peat, everything
[19:41.160 --> 19:42.200]  that comes in.
[19:42.360 --> 19:45.480]  Give it a nice look while you're working with it, while you're mixing it up.
[19:45.480 --> 19:46.480]  Pay attention.
[19:46.480 --> 19:47.480]  Does something crawl up your arm?
[19:47.480 --> 19:50.440]  Does something climb up the baby plants right when you put it in there?
[19:50.440 --> 19:52.960]  Does anything fly out of the soil or the soil is mixed?
[19:52.960 --> 19:55.160]  When you tap on it, pay close attention.
[19:55.160 --> 19:58.220]  That is the easiest way to identify a pest problem.
[19:58.220 --> 20:03.200]  So it is time to just start looking more closely at your soil, your soil is mixed, or any type
[20:03.200 --> 20:06.400]  of medium that can carry a pest when you bring it into the garden.
[20:06.400 --> 20:08.960]  Just start paying a little closer attention from now on.
[20:08.960 --> 20:09.960]  All right.
[20:09.960 --> 20:11.920]  I want to thank you once again for the great email.
[20:11.920 --> 20:13.000]  Let's keep going with the emails.
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.480]  I've got another message printed out here in front of me.
[20:15.480 --> 20:17.120]  This one goes like this.
[20:17.120 --> 20:19.520]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, happy Easter.
[20:19.520 --> 20:23.600]  First, I want to thank you for what you do and for your podcast.
[20:23.600 --> 20:25.460]  Hey, you're very welcome.
[20:25.460 --> 20:27.760]  Thank you for the great email and thank you for the support.
[20:27.760 --> 20:30.900]  All of the compliments, all the praise, that all makes it worth it.
[20:30.900 --> 20:31.900]  So let's keep going.
[20:31.900 --> 20:35.780]  It says, I live in Indiana, which obviously is a non-legal state.
[20:35.780 --> 20:40.600]  So the closest indoor gardening store to me is almost two hours away.
[20:40.600 --> 20:45.120]  So I don't have the luxury of being able to walk in and get recommendations from experienced
[20:45.120 --> 20:50.180]  growers about my babies or products and techniques for my babies.
[20:50.180 --> 20:53.940]  That pretty much leaves me with two options, which are the forums where you really have
[20:53.940 --> 20:59.440]  to dig to get solid info you know you can trust, or find a professional such as yourself
[20:59.440 --> 21:02.080]  and kind of latch on to their techniques.
[21:02.080 --> 21:06.020]  I started listening to the podcast pretty much from the start and I have had great success
[21:06.020 --> 21:08.420]  by doing what you recommend.
[21:08.420 --> 21:13.000]  You have already saved me a lot of time and a lot of money for sure.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  That means a lot to me.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.040]  I know that there are people that don't have resources, people who are isolated, they're
[21:18.040 --> 21:22.760]  in locations or situations where they may not be able to ask for help in their garden.
[21:22.760 --> 21:27.520]  So I am happy to help everybody produce a quality product and take care of themselves.
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.280]  So it always puts a huge smile on my face hearing that I have helped somebody save time
[21:31.280 --> 21:32.280]  and money.
[21:32.280 --> 21:35.880]  You guys, time is priceless and money is expensive.
[21:35.880 --> 21:40.060]  The message goes on, it says, I am in sales and I like to support and do business with
[21:40.060 --> 21:41.780]  people who do business with me.
[21:41.780 --> 21:46.020]  And even though you haven't done business with me, you have still helped me tremendously
[21:46.020 --> 21:47.560]  like I have mentioned.
[21:47.560 --> 21:52.780]  So with that being said, I am wanting to run an Irie strain for my next run.
[21:52.780 --> 21:55.620]  I wish Arise came as a fem seed.
[21:55.620 --> 21:57.860]  I would definitely be going that route.
[21:57.860 --> 22:02.580]  Is there any chance you will ever offer a feminized Arise seed?
[22:03.280 --> 22:07.320]  Yes, I do plan on making feminized Arise seeds in the future.
[22:07.320 --> 22:11.720]  However, I have no projected date for that project.
[22:11.720 --> 22:15.160]  My grow, my breeding projects, everything is scheduled.
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.280]  My spaces are planned.
[22:16.280 --> 22:19.520]  My spaces are booked all the way through 2019.
[22:19.520 --> 22:25.760]  I have got the first crop of 2020 planned for my breeding space and none of that includes
[22:25.760 --> 22:29.200]  a feminized Arise project.
[22:29.200 --> 22:30.840]  It is on the list of stuff to do.
[22:30.840 --> 22:32.080]  It is on the goal sheet.
[22:32.580 --> 22:35.820]  It is part of something that I've had in my mind for a long time and I know that it would
[22:35.820 --> 22:37.000]  be a hot seller.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.740]  I just haven't committed space and time to that yet.
[22:39.740 --> 22:41.780]  There are so many other things I want to do.
[22:41.780 --> 22:47.420]  I know that the consumers want the Arise as a breeder, as the artist here, as the person
[22:47.420 --> 22:50.060]  doing the work and creating the things.
[22:50.060 --> 22:52.100]  That's just not on my mind yet.
[22:52.100 --> 22:53.100]  It'll happen.
[22:53.100 --> 22:54.100]  It'll pop into my heart.
[22:54.100 --> 22:56.740]  It'll pop into my mind and I'll go, okay, it's time to make those Arise fems.
[22:56.740 --> 22:57.980]  I'm just not there yet.
[22:57.980 --> 23:01.720]  That's kind of how a weirdo breeder and a grower and a cultivator and an artist, if
[23:01.720 --> 23:03.760]  you will, that's just how we work.
[23:03.760 --> 23:06.720]  So yes, I will make it, but no promise as to when.
[23:06.720 --> 23:07.960]  Let's keep going.
[23:07.960 --> 23:12.560]  It says, also because of my busy work schedule and just kind of life, I guess, I am looking
[23:12.560 --> 23:18.480]  for a strain that has a high THC content and finishes fairly quickly.
[23:18.480 --> 23:21.600]  That's what everybody wants, that quick finisher and a lot of THC.
[23:21.600 --> 23:23.720]  We're going to talk about that in a second.
[23:23.720 --> 23:27.480]  They say if there was something that finished in eight weeks and was consistently 20 plus
[23:27.980 --> 23:35.220]  THC, I would jump all over that, but I really want to be no longer than nine weeks of flower.
[23:35.220 --> 23:39.860]  I have found out the times most breeders put on their packs are not accurate at all, so
[23:39.860 --> 23:45.400]  I figured I'd shoot an email straight to the breeder and see if I could not get a response.
[23:45.400 --> 23:46.400]  He keeps going.
[23:46.400 --> 23:50.580]  He says, I don't care if it's an Indica Sativa hybrid strain and I'm going to be flowering
[23:50.580 --> 23:53.940]  with a 1000 watt HPS and it will be in soil.
[23:53.940 --> 23:56.560]  If the strain was easy to grow, that would be a plus.
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.040]  Just because some days I may not be able to check them, but not a must.
[24:00.040 --> 24:02.820]  I'd say I'm a pretty experienced grower.
[24:02.820 --> 24:03.820]  Thanks for your time, man.
[24:03.820 --> 24:05.880]  I hope your 420 was fucking awesome.
[24:05.880 --> 24:08.280]  Please keep doing what you're doing.
[24:08.280 --> 24:10.120]  There's a lot to unpack there.
[24:10.120 --> 24:11.840]  My 420 was fucking awesome.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.600]  I will keep doing what I'm doing.
[24:13.600 --> 24:14.600]  He signs it.
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.880]  He says, best wishes.
[24:15.880 --> 24:16.880]  We're just going to say from Mike.
[24:16.880 --> 24:19.200]  Hey, Mike, thank you for the great message.
[24:19.200 --> 24:20.200]  Let's back up.
[24:20.200 --> 24:22.160]  There's some stuff to talk about here.
[24:22.160 --> 24:28.460]  Mike wants a strain that finishes in eight or nine weeks and has high THC.
[24:28.460 --> 24:33.380]  In my opinion, longer flowering strains tend to be more potent.
[24:33.380 --> 24:37.380]  Those hazes that take a really long time to finish, those things rip your head off.
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.380]  They're psychedelic.
[24:38.380 --> 24:40.980]  They give you a panic attack, make you forget where you are.
[24:40.980 --> 24:43.140]  They make you lose your car keys while they're in your hand.
[24:43.140 --> 24:45.780]  They make you lose your sunglasses while they're on your face.
[24:45.780 --> 24:50.700]  I feel like things that take a little bit longer tend to get more potent.
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.760]  If you're looking for higher THC, you may need to be open to a little bit longer flowering
[24:55.760 --> 24:56.760]  times.
[24:56.760 --> 24:57.760]  You said eight or nine weeks.
[24:57.760 --> 24:58.760]  That is acceptable.
[24:58.760 --> 25:00.040]  Nine weeks is more ideal.
[25:00.040 --> 25:02.960]  Eight weeks is a little bit early for high THC.
[25:02.960 --> 25:05.760]  You said 20 plus percent.
[25:05.760 --> 25:11.160]  Everything I am currently breeding for the market should test over 20% THC consistently
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.000]  if it is grown by an experienced grower.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.500]  Most of my stuff should hit 25% or higher.
[25:17.500 --> 25:21.680]  You should be able to get close to 30 with many of my crosses.
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.560]  I've seen a test for 35.84% THC from one of my crosses.
[25:26.560 --> 25:28.960]  I've seen several 33s and 32s.
[25:28.960 --> 25:30.960]  30 is very common.
[25:30.960 --> 25:34.560]  High 20s is a regular thing when it comes to testing my genetics.
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.960]  Now, if you insist on having something that finishes a little bit early, from my line,
[25:38.960 --> 25:41.600]  I would recommend Sunkiss or Prana.
[25:41.600 --> 25:44.520]  Prana is going to be more on the funky scented side.
[25:44.520 --> 25:47.320]  It smells like dirty feet and incense.
[25:47.340 --> 25:50.460]  It will make some really unique purple and silvery colors.
[25:50.460 --> 25:54.020]  It's a really great plant to grow indoors and outdoors, but it does finish a little
[25:54.020 --> 25:58.920]  bit earlier than most of my other stuff, closer to the eight or nine week range for you.
[25:58.920 --> 26:01.500]  Another one I would suggest is, of course, the Sunkiss.
[26:01.500 --> 26:06.540]  That one has a delicious, greasy orange, kind of a tart cherry sort of a flavor.
[26:06.540 --> 26:09.060]  That one will be done in eight weeks for you.
[26:09.060 --> 26:11.920]  Sunkiss is really easy to grow indoors and outdoors.
[26:11.920 --> 26:12.920]  It won't get too tall.
[26:12.920 --> 26:16.420]  Again, it will finish in that eight to nine week timeframe.
[26:16.520 --> 26:21.400]  Most of the phenotypes will finish right around eight weeks for you, so that should be perfect.
[26:21.400 --> 26:24.480]  I wish I could convince you to go that extra one week.
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.120]  When you run eight weeks, you kind of limit yourself on options of plants which will work
[26:29.120 --> 26:30.480]  in your environment.
[26:30.480 --> 26:34.680]  There are many more cultivars or variety available.
[26:34.680 --> 26:39.200]  They'll be done in the nine week period compared to plants that finish in that eight week period.
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.120]  Again, I think if you have more time to grow, you can get more potency and you can also
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.680]  get bigger, fatter buds.
[26:46.260 --> 26:50.020]  So if it were up to me, I would encourage you to go that nine full weeks.
[26:50.020 --> 26:51.100]  Let's talk about the next part.
[26:51.100 --> 26:55.780]  It says, I have found that the times most breeders put on their packs are not accurate
[26:55.780 --> 26:59.900]  at all, so I figured I would shoot an email straight to the breeder and see if I could
[26:59.900 --> 27:00.900]  get a response.
[27:00.900 --> 27:03.580]  If that is a good way to do it, go straight to the breeder.
[27:03.580 --> 27:06.860]  I cannot speak for anybody but myself.
[27:06.860 --> 27:13.460]  I do my best to put an accurate representation of the expected flowering time on my strain
[27:13.460 --> 27:14.740]  descriptions.
[27:14.800 --> 27:18.160]  Now let's talk about how I come up with those projected times.
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.360]  The way I do it is when I make a new cross, I run that cross myself.
[27:22.360 --> 27:23.880]  I take very good notes.
[27:23.880 --> 27:27.060]  I pay attention to the flowering times of those plants.
[27:27.060 --> 27:28.280]  I write it down.
[27:28.280 --> 27:31.600]  I grow large populations so that I know what to expect.
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.320]  I also know the parents of those plants so I know what to expect.
[27:35.320 --> 27:40.400]  Once I've got a good idea of how long they take, how they perform, if there are any issues,
[27:40.400 --> 27:44.660]  if they're reliable, once I'm satisfied with what I see, I send more of them out to my
[27:44.660 --> 27:46.540]  friends and they grow them.
[27:46.540 --> 27:49.080]  I expect those people to send me reports.
[27:49.080 --> 27:52.260]  I get back reports on how many seeds germinated.
[27:52.260 --> 27:54.720]  I get reports on how quickly the plants grew.
[27:54.720 --> 27:57.120]  I get reports on how long they vege the plants.
[27:57.120 --> 27:59.480]  I get reports on how long the plants were flowered.
[27:59.480 --> 28:03.620]  I get reports on how many males and how many females were in each pack.
[28:03.620 --> 28:07.000]  I get a lot of information back from my friends that are testers for me.
[28:07.180 --> 28:11.160]  That is how I determine what numbers to put on my seed packages.
[28:11.160 --> 28:13.460]  It is from what I see.
[28:13.460 --> 28:17.680]  Flowering time can vary from environment to environment and it will vary from phenotype
[28:17.680 --> 28:18.680]  to phenotype.
[28:18.680 --> 28:20.520]  That is why I try to give about a week range.
[28:20.520 --> 28:22.540]  I say eight to nine weeks.
[28:22.540 --> 28:25.100]  Sometimes I will say 50 to 60 days.
[28:25.100 --> 28:28.560]  In some cases, I'll say 56 to 70 days.
[28:28.560 --> 28:31.760]  It just depends on what strain I'm working with and what I have seen.
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.880]  I do my best to be completely honest and completely reliable when it comes to giving you strain,
[28:36.880 --> 28:37.880]  finishing times.
[28:37.880 --> 28:41.240]  I understand you were planning a garden and a crop around those times.
[28:41.240 --> 28:45.240]  We need things to be done in the time we expect them to be done or it can throw everything
[28:45.240 --> 28:48.960]  off schedule and it can cause bigger problems.
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.280]  Only speaking for myself, I determine the flowering time that I put on my website or
[28:53.280 --> 28:58.400]  on my packaging based on what I see from the testers that I run myself and my friends who
[28:58.400 --> 29:00.760]  are also testers run for me.
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.340]  That could be different in your environment.
[29:02.340 --> 29:07.060]  If you have an LED light, if you've got CO2, if it's too hot or if it's too cold, things
[29:07.060 --> 29:08.060]  could be different.
[29:08.060 --> 29:12.100]  If you're running HPS and you've got a lot of humidity or if you've got an LED in a really
[29:12.100 --> 29:17.300]  cold room, all of those things are going to be factors on how long your plants take to
[29:17.300 --> 29:18.300]  flower.
[29:18.300 --> 29:22.460]  The main determining factor is of course the genetics and the phenotype, but we could change
[29:22.460 --> 29:25.940]  that by a week to 10 days just with environmental conditions.
[29:25.940 --> 29:29.020]  We can probably speed it up also by feeding it certain things.
[29:29.020 --> 29:32.180]  So there are things we can do to speed up and slow down these plants.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.660]  It kind of depends on what's happening in your environment.
[29:34.660 --> 29:39.780]  I honestly do my best to be quite accurate when it comes to listing expected flowering
[29:39.780 --> 29:40.780]  times.
[29:40.780 --> 29:45.140]  And just a random note that I've mentioned before, flowering starts the day you turn
[29:45.140 --> 29:47.060]  the lights to 12-12.
[29:47.060 --> 29:49.020]  That is day one of week one.
[29:49.020 --> 29:53.720]  That is when you're eight or nine week or maybe 10 or 11, possibly at 12 or even longer.
[29:53.720 --> 29:57.880]  That's when your flowering cycle begins is right then when you flip to 12-12.
[29:57.880 --> 29:59.860]  So there is one more paragraph on this message.
[29:59.860 --> 30:04.020]  It says, I don't care if the strain is Indica, Sativa or hybrid, I'm going to be flowering
[30:04.020 --> 30:07.640]  with a thousand watt HPS and it will be in soil.
[30:07.640 --> 30:09.180]  So I did recommend a strain for you.
[30:09.180 --> 30:11.780]  And then he says, I hope your 420 was fucking awesome.
[30:11.780 --> 30:13.100]  Dude, my 420 was great.
[30:13.100 --> 30:14.580]  I had a perfect 420.
[30:14.580 --> 30:16.780]  I could not have asked for anything better.
[30:16.780 --> 30:19.720]  Hey Mike, I want to thank you for a great email.
