[00:16.700 --> 00:19.380]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.380 --> 00:22.660]  It's time for episode number 119 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:22.940 --> 00:27.520]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.540]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.700 --> 00:31.740]  if you're a new smoker or a hardcore dabber,
[00:32.060 --> 00:34.960]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.960 --> 00:38.420]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.780 --> 00:41.540]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.540 --> 00:43.940]  I want to thank you again for joining me as always.
[00:44.020 --> 00:46.680]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots
[00:46.680 --> 00:50.000]  band for letting me use their music on my show. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.320]  and the entire mystic roots crew. I hope everybody's having a great day.
[00:55.320 --> 00:57.880]  I hope you got a fat joint rolled up. I hope you got a dab on the dabber.
[00:57.880 --> 01:00.560]  Hope you got the vaporizer loaded up. I hope you ate some good edibles.
[01:00.960 --> 01:02.920]  Maybe you're smoking some rosin, whatever you're doing.
[01:02.920 --> 01:05.240]  Hope you're getting ripped with me. You know what I'm doing?
[01:05.240 --> 01:08.000]  I'm sitting here smoking out of the hitman short stack with the email attached
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.160]  to it. Big shout out to our friends at hitman glass.
[01:10.180 --> 01:12.380]  This short stack has become my new rig.
[01:12.380 --> 01:15.960]  I really love the hitman short stack with the email on it. Nothing like it.
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.880]  Anytime I go somewhere else and try to take dabs, I'm like,
[01:17.880 --> 01:20.720]  I miss the short stack. Let's go get the short stack and hit that.
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.640]  So big shout out to our friends at hitman glass.
[01:22.660 --> 01:25.040]  Make sure you follow hitman glass hitman glass,
[01:25.200 --> 01:27.520]  glass rigs made in America by Americans.
[01:27.760 --> 01:29.960]  Hitman glass is an innovator in the hash community.
[01:30.160 --> 01:33.040]  They're not only a glass company, those guys smoke tons of hash.
[01:33.060 --> 01:37.440]  They know what a quality hash pipe work looks like, how it works, how it functions.
[01:37.440 --> 01:40.760]  They know what we're looking for. You guys also support the chalice festival.
[01:40.760 --> 01:44.700]  This summer in California, there's a festival called chalice. You want to go.
[01:44.700 --> 01:48.820]  It is a hash music and art festival is a very unique festival put on by our
[01:48.820 --> 01:53.100]  friends at hitman glass. Make sure you check that out. Maybe I will see you there.
[01:54.460 --> 01:56.260]  That's enough advertising for today. You guys,
[01:56.380 --> 01:58.540]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, L Diablo.
[01:58.540 --> 02:01.780]  L Diablo tried to make a contribution to my a podcast,
[02:01.780 --> 02:04.300]  to my PayPal page on my podcast page on my website.
[02:04.300 --> 02:06.820]  That's a lot of words right there. Uh, unfortunately,
[02:06.980 --> 02:08.500]  we talked a little bit about this last week.
[02:08.500 --> 02:11.300]  My PayPal account was suspended at this time.
[02:11.300 --> 02:14.060]  My PayPal account has been deleted.
[02:14.060 --> 02:17.100]  I do no longer have a PayPal account associated to the grow from your heart
[02:17.100 --> 02:20.980]  podcast. I will find another way to accept your contributions in the near future,
[02:20.980 --> 02:24.700]  but huge shout out to L Diablo. He sent me an email. He said, Hey dude,
[02:24.700 --> 02:27.140]  your PayPal thing is broken on your website. What can I do?
[02:27.420 --> 02:30.700]  I gave him some guidance on how to get a contribution my way and he definitely
[02:30.700 --> 02:34.020]  came through huge shout out L Diablo. I appreciate that.
[02:34.020 --> 02:35.580]  Thanks for watching my Periscope videos.
[02:35.580 --> 02:40.140]  Thanks for listening to my podcast and thank you for being my Facebook friend.
[02:40.780 --> 02:43.980]  Speaking to my friends, I need to give a huge shout out to Clark. What up Clark?
[02:43.980 --> 02:47.780]  I miss you. Uh, we need you back. Um,
[02:47.980 --> 02:50.420]  since I'm giving a shout out to Clark, I want to give a huge shout out to Louie,
[02:50.420 --> 02:54.500]  John Randall's Jr. Lewis, Haley, damsel, Joe, Amy,
[02:54.660 --> 02:58.740]  and an extra fat high five and a Rasta fist bump to my boy, John Hunt. Uh,
[02:58.780 --> 03:01.260]  that is most of the crew at green and healthy wellness.
[03:01.580 --> 03:04.020]  There are a couple other folks that you guys know you're included in that,
[03:04.020 --> 03:07.380]  but I cannot say your name on the podcast. You two assholes know who you are.
[03:07.380 --> 03:09.860]  Big shout out, much love, much respect. Uh,
[03:09.860 --> 03:12.500]  I've been working at green and healthy wellness for several months now.
[03:12.900 --> 03:16.980]  I got a crop in the flower room. It's been flowered out. It is harvest time.
[03:17.180 --> 03:19.420]  We have been trimming our asses off. Uh,
[03:19.460 --> 03:22.300]  most of the folks I just listened have had scissors going constantly.
[03:22.300 --> 03:25.540]  Their thumbs are going numb. Their eyes are going across their necks are sore.
[03:25.540 --> 03:26.620]  They've been trimming their hearts out.
[03:27.620 --> 03:30.900]  But what that means is that by the time this podcast comes out,
[03:31.140 --> 03:34.780]  you will be able to go to green and healthy wellness in Colorado Springs and
[03:34.780 --> 03:39.620]  you will be able to pick up flowers grown by Rasta Jeff and trimmed by my trim
[03:39.620 --> 03:43.900]  crew. So drop in, tell them, I told you it is a medical marijuana only facility.
[03:43.900 --> 03:47.380]  The city of Colorado Springs does not offer any recreational cannabis.
[03:47.580 --> 03:50.700]  So it's at four 30 West Colorado. Bring your purple card, bring your ID,
[03:50.700 --> 03:53.700]  tell them Rasta Jeff sent you. We would love to see you when you're there.
[03:53.700 --> 03:56.940]  Make sure you check out some of this cactus cooler live resin or some of this
[03:56.940 --> 03:58.660]  G funk OG live resin.
[03:58.900 --> 04:03.460]  That is some of my favorite shit I have smoked in a really long time.
[04:03.900 --> 04:06.660]  All right. So big shout out to the crew. Shout out to El Diablo.
[04:07.180 --> 04:11.100]  Let's brag a little bit. You guys, uh, my friends at kind love a long time ago,
[04:11.100 --> 04:13.220]  my friend, um, I don't even know if I should say his name.
[04:13.220 --> 04:17.860]  My friend was the owner of kind love and he received some seeds for me as a
[04:17.860 --> 04:21.940]  gift. And he, uh, this was years ago. He sprouted those seeds.
[04:21.940 --> 04:26.180]  He did a little Fino hunting and eventually one of those phenotypes ended up in
[04:26.180 --> 04:29.900]  the garden at kind love. And it was a lemon Jeffrey phenotype from seed.
[04:30.020 --> 04:34.780]  And it was recently tested by a lab at 30% THC a.
[04:35.020 --> 04:39.460]  So I read genetics is now officially in the 30% club. I did not grow it,
[04:39.460 --> 04:43.700]  but it is a strain that I bred. So that counts. I'm in the club.
[04:43.740 --> 04:47.500]  I'm kind of proud of that. Big shout out to our friends at kind love cultivation.
[04:47.500 --> 04:51.260]  And also a big shout out to my buddy sack master flex on Instagram for sending me
[04:51.260 --> 04:54.980]  the information. Um, you might remember a couple of weeks ago,
[04:54.980 --> 04:58.180]  we talked about a product called guardian might spray. Uh,
[04:58.180 --> 05:02.380]  there was a product that was very popular and very successful in the, uh,
[05:02.420 --> 05:04.700]  commercial cannabis production world.
[05:05.420 --> 05:08.180]  This stuff was knocking out any pest problems that may arise.
[05:08.980 --> 05:13.900]  But one day it was discovered that there was a chemical or a product inside of
[05:13.900 --> 05:16.340]  that bottle that was not listed on the label.
[05:16.660 --> 05:21.420]  And said product has been banned from cultivate from cannabis cultivation in the
[05:21.420 --> 05:23.140]  state of Washington. Uh,
[05:23.180 --> 05:26.300]  these people put this product on their gardens thinking it was safe.
[05:26.340 --> 05:29.420]  And then it was found out that their garden is no longer organic because they
[05:29.420 --> 05:30.420]  used guardian.
[05:31.260 --> 05:35.260]  I made it clear on this podcast that the folks from guardian could contact me if
[05:35.260 --> 05:36.420]  they had anything to say.
[05:36.740 --> 05:40.540]  It's been a couple of weeks and I have not heard anything from guardian at this
[05:40.540 --> 05:45.180]  time. Uh, if you work for guardian, if you know somebody that works for guardian,
[05:45.180 --> 05:46.380]  if you represent guardian,
[05:46.380 --> 05:49.860]  if you know something about guardian and you'd like to tell me, uh,
[05:49.900 --> 05:52.620]  you can contact me as grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[05:52.660 --> 05:56.420]  I'd love to get you set up on the podcast and you can tell the world what went
[05:56.420 --> 06:00.660]  on with your product. It would be great. Uh, you can call me, I can go to you,
[06:00.700 --> 06:03.340]  you can come to me. We'll put you on the air and let your, uh,
[06:03.500 --> 06:06.180]  let your voice be heard. All right. So you guys,
[06:06.180 --> 06:10.140]  I want to get to some reviews on iTunes. We're going to read some reviews.
[06:10.140 --> 06:12.500]  And then after that we will read some emails.
[06:12.500 --> 06:17.500]  I'm actually going to the iTunes store right now to open up the tab so that I
[06:17.500 --> 06:20.020]  can read you some comments. I'm going to take a dab.
[06:20.020 --> 06:22.700]  While this pulls up and we'll be right back. All right, you guys,
[06:22.700 --> 06:23.700]  I'm going to read some comments.
[06:23.700 --> 06:25.340]  Then we'll work our way through some emails,
[06:25.340 --> 06:28.820]  which will kind of work us into a short grow lesson.
[06:29.140 --> 06:30.700]  Let's get to the first comment.
[06:31.260 --> 06:35.260]  This comment was sent to us by our friend Tom's Astro blog and it was sent
[06:35.260 --> 06:38.660]  December 10th, 2015. And it says here in Vermont,
[06:38.680 --> 06:41.100]  we're in the midst of going rec legal through the legislature.
[06:41.140 --> 06:43.060]  Some of your topics hit on the very issues.
[06:43.060 --> 06:46.700]  The committee writing the bill are dealing with. They're doing their homework.
[06:46.740 --> 06:48.780]  Peace. Tom, Tom,
[06:48.780 --> 06:52.060]  does that mean that the committee writing the bills are listening to the grow
[06:52.060 --> 06:55.260]  from your heart podcast? That would be really great to hear.
[06:55.620 --> 06:59.380]  I hope you're contributing to getting those bills written and make sure that
[06:59.380 --> 07:02.820]  when you write the bills, you include somewhere to consume the cannabis.
[07:02.820 --> 07:04.420]  That's what we messed up on in Colorado.
[07:04.420 --> 07:06.260]  We've got the seed to sale thing figured out.
[07:06.580 --> 07:08.540]  We've got a nice regulation system set up.
[07:08.540 --> 07:10.900]  We've got a nice production system set up.
[07:11.220 --> 07:13.100]  The thing we messed up on here in Colorado,
[07:13.500 --> 07:16.140]  people can come from out of state and they can buy cannabis,
[07:16.340 --> 07:20.060]  but there's nowhere for them to safely or illegally consume that product.
[07:20.300 --> 07:23.740]  So my recommendation when you're writing those rules,
[07:24.500 --> 07:28.980]  make it legal to open a social smoke club. We need places like that.
[07:28.980 --> 07:32.900]  We need places like the Canna Canyon, a shout out to the Canna Canyon in Colorado
[07:32.900 --> 07:36.940]  Springs, my favorite social smoke club. Um, it's a members only club.
[07:36.940 --> 07:38.580]  You pay a small fee, you sign up,
[07:38.580 --> 07:41.100]  you prove that you're old enough and you can go in and you can hang out and you
[07:41.100 --> 07:44.140]  can socialize and take some dabs. Uh, you can smoke out.
[07:44.140 --> 07:47.020]  I'm going to do another podcast from there. I've done a show from there before.
[07:47.180 --> 07:51.060]  We need places like that for members of this community to congregate and hang
[07:51.060 --> 07:52.180]  out and teach each other things.
[07:52.180 --> 07:56.740]  We have bars where people can go get shit face drunk and get in fights and
[07:56.980 --> 07:58.780]  sorry, I'm not going to judge the people to drink alcohol,
[07:58.780 --> 08:00.940]  but you're able to do that. You can go out in public,
[08:00.980 --> 08:05.380]  you can get shit face drunk and it's available on every corner in every city,
[08:05.580 --> 08:09.660]  but there is nowhere for us to safely and legally consume the cannabis we can
[08:09.660 --> 08:10.020]  purchase.
[08:10.020 --> 08:14.220]  So my advice to you in Vermont is to make sure there is somewhere you can smoke
[08:14.220 --> 08:18.460]  the cannabis that people are allowed to buy. Uh, Hey, Tom's Astro blog,
[08:18.460 --> 08:22.740]  huge thanks for the email and also huge thanks for the five star rating.
[08:22.820 --> 08:23.100]  You guys,
[08:23.100 --> 08:26.300]  every comment and every rating that the grow from your heart podcast has
[08:26.300 --> 08:29.380]  received as a five star rating. So I thank you guys for that.
[08:29.820 --> 08:33.420]  I'm going to move to the next comment. The headline says grow from your heart.
[08:33.420 --> 08:36.340]  They gave me a five star rating. This was left by Mr. Jones,
[08:36.340 --> 08:40.260]  six one seven on January 4th. And it says, this man is great.
[08:40.260 --> 08:43.660]  I wish he was my next door neighbor so he could teach me how to grow.
[08:44.100 --> 08:46.500]  Bro. If I was your next door neighbor, I teach you a lot more than how to grow.
[08:46.500 --> 08:49.260]  I'd teach you how to take fat dabs and teach you how to carb cap.
[08:49.740 --> 08:51.740]  We'd be hanging out, bro. You'd be on the podcast.
[08:51.740 --> 08:54.340]  We'd be talking about your garden. You'd be hanging out with me and white Mike.
[08:54.860 --> 08:58.220]  Uh, find me on Facebook, find me on Instagram, find me on Twitter,
[08:58.220 --> 09:00.060]  send me some messages and be my friend.
[09:00.060 --> 09:01.900]  And it'll turn out to where we feel like we're neighbors.
[09:01.900 --> 09:03.780]  Cause I'll teach you everything I know. All right.
[09:03.780 --> 09:06.100]  Thanks for the message or the comment, Mr. Jones.
[09:06.100 --> 09:09.700]  And thanks for the five star rating. I'm going to move on to the next one.
[09:09.700 --> 09:14.700]  The headline is Beck's best grow podcast. And it's from Rick rat BMX,
[09:15.580 --> 09:19.260]  BMX. Do you ride BMX bikes? That'd be really cool. If you did. Uh,
[09:19.260 --> 09:21.860]  when I was younger, I used to ride a freestyle bikes.
[09:21.860 --> 09:25.100]  I had a GT Vertigo for a long time and I had a GT performer.
[09:25.100 --> 09:29.380]  I actually liked the Vertigo better. Uh, my favorite trick was a 360 tailwhip.
[09:30.100 --> 09:32.180]  Uh, I was a crazy kid. I can't ride bikes too well.
[09:32.180 --> 09:35.900]  Now I'm like six, five and old. So I feel like when I fall down,
[09:35.900 --> 09:38.460]  it takes me all fucking day to get back up. So no more BMX for me.
[09:38.460 --> 09:41.780]  I hope you're out there riding the BMX. Anyway, Rick rats, Rick rat.
[09:41.780 --> 09:45.500]  BMX is comment says the GFYH podcast. Excuse me.
[09:45.500 --> 09:49.300]  The GFYH podcast has really helped advance my career in the cannabis industry.
[09:49.700 --> 09:54.660]  Tips are on point and the extra comedy is always welcomed. Uh,
[09:54.660 --> 09:55.500]  Rick rat BMX.
[09:55.500 --> 10:00.020]  I'm curious how I helped advance your career in the cannabis industry.
[10:00.020 --> 10:03.500]  Are you in the legal cannabis industry now? Um, send me an email,
[10:03.700 --> 10:05.620]  let me know what state you were in,
[10:05.980 --> 10:07.860]  how you were in the legal cannabis industry.
[10:07.860 --> 10:09.940]  And I'd like to know how I helped you advance.
[10:09.940 --> 10:13.180]  Did you start off as a trimmer and now you're a lead cultivator? Uh,
[10:13.220 --> 10:15.380]  give me some info and let me know what I did for you.
[10:15.780 --> 10:19.220]  And we will talk about that on an upcoming podcast. Uh,
[10:19.220 --> 10:22.460]  and tips are always on point and you enjoy the extra comedy. That's rad, dude.
[10:22.460 --> 10:25.940]  Thanks for noticing that I try to keep it lighthearted. I'm kind of a silly dude.
[10:26.260 --> 10:27.100]  Can't be too serious.
[10:27.100 --> 10:29.700]  You gotta laugh at some shit or you'll just stress out and die.
[10:29.700 --> 10:33.460]  So thanks for listening to show that I'm glad I was able to move you in your
[10:33.460 --> 10:37.500]  career. That's rad. Send me some emails. Let me know what I did for you. Uh,
[10:37.500 --> 10:40.980]  we'll get you even further. So thanks for the comment. Rick rat BMX.
[10:40.980 --> 10:42.260]  We're going to move to the next comment.
[10:42.540 --> 10:45.900]  It says fun to listen to and great information.
[10:46.220 --> 10:50.020]  And this one was from photography by Jay young.
[10:50.300 --> 10:54.340]  The comment says Rasta Jeff is super knowledgeable on all aspects of growing
[10:54.340 --> 10:58.460]  cannabis and the many different aspects of the Colorado industry.
[10:58.900 --> 11:02.540]  That is a true statement. I can't argue that at all. Uh, thanks for the support.
[11:02.540 --> 11:04.940]  Thanks for the comment. Uh, you know,
[11:04.940 --> 11:08.100]  I didn't realize that I know a lot of different aspects.
[11:08.100 --> 11:10.180]  Somebody pointed that out to me the other day. It is kind of sweet.
[11:10.220 --> 11:13.580]  So you're welcome for me sharing that info. And thanks for the comment.
[11:14.140 --> 11:17.540]  Let's go to the next comment. You guys are a few of them left. This one says,
[11:17.580 --> 11:20.100]  Oh, that is not the right button. I wanted to push. Here we go.
[11:20.100 --> 11:23.700]  This one says great show by awesomeness incorporated.
[11:24.020 --> 11:27.940]  This one was left January 13th of 2016. Nice and simple comment.
[11:27.940 --> 11:32.660]  It says never boring, uh, accurate. Can't argue with that.
[11:32.660 --> 11:34.700]  Except for right now, this might be boring reading comments,
[11:34.700 --> 11:37.700]  but the people that got comments on here is super fucking excited to hear their
[11:37.700 --> 11:39.660]  name and their comments. So shout out to those folks.
[11:39.980 --> 11:43.260]  Hang on to the rest of you and we'll get to some cool stuff. Um,
[11:43.300 --> 11:46.100]  awesomeness incorporated. Thanks for the comment. That's a cool ass name.
[11:46.100 --> 11:48.300]  I appreciate you. I'm glad you're listening to the show.

[12:03.380 --> 12:06.020]  the 30 minutes while you're listening to my show. Let me know what happens.
[12:06.460 --> 12:09.340]  Are you at work? Are you in the car? Are you doing dishes? You just chilling,
[12:09.580 --> 12:11.300]  you smoking out, you hanging out with the friends.
[12:11.460 --> 12:13.700]  Let me know what you're doing. Awesomeness incorporated.
[12:13.940 --> 12:16.260]  Let me know that it was you that sent this comment.
[12:16.260 --> 12:18.660]  It'd be like I'm awesomeness incorporated and here's what I'm doing when I'm
[12:18.660 --> 12:22.660]  listening. I'm curious. All right. Thanks for the compliment and the comment.
[12:22.660 --> 12:26.340]  The next one comes from Chibis 710.
[12:26.620 --> 12:31.620]  The headline is love this podcast and it was left on January 17th of 2016.
[12:32.340 --> 12:36.380]  The comment goes like this. Great podcast, Rasta Jeff,
[12:36.580 --> 12:39.460]  myself and my plants both appreciate your knowledge and effort.
[12:39.500 --> 12:42.060]  I found this podcast shortly after moving to Colorado.
[12:42.380 --> 12:45.940]  I use tips and tricks learned from your podcast every day while I'm working in
[12:45.940 --> 12:50.220]  my garden. Great work. I recommend to everyone I meet who's into cannabis.
[12:51.060 --> 12:52.740]  Well, I'm glad you recommend the show to people.
[12:53.300 --> 12:54.460]  I hope more people are listening.
[12:54.460 --> 12:56.260]  I hope more people are growing better cannabis.
[12:57.020 --> 12:59.620]  I'm truly glad that you and your plants appreciate the show.
[13:00.340 --> 13:01.980]  I'm sure that your plants can see a difference.
[13:01.980 --> 13:05.340]  I'm sure you can see a difference in your plants, which means it's working,
[13:05.340 --> 13:07.180]  which means you're a good listener. You're learning shit.
[13:07.540 --> 13:10.260]  You're applying what you're learning and your plants are showing it to you.
[13:10.260 --> 13:13.700]  So awesome. Good work. That means you're doing your job as a good grower.
[13:13.900 --> 13:17.300]  It means I'm doing my good job as a good teacher. So thanks for the support.
[13:17.300 --> 13:19.740]  Thanks for the compliment. Thanks for the five star rating.
[13:19.940 --> 13:23.180]  You said you just moved to Colorado. Uh, send me an email,
[13:23.300 --> 13:27.140]  let me know where you came from and then we'll talk a little bit more. All right,
[13:27.140 --> 13:30.860]  I'm going to go on to the next comment. This one comes from the Loverins.
[13:30.900 --> 13:35.300]  I think I said that right. Flow, flow, lover, F, flow, flover ends. That's you.
[13:35.340 --> 13:38.260]  That's who you are. Now you're flover ends. I got a five star review,
[13:38.300 --> 13:40.820]  some cute little emojis. We've got a tree, we've got a squinty face.
[13:40.820 --> 13:43.180]  We've got the prayer hands. We've got a kiss, we've got a heart,
[13:43.180 --> 13:47.980]  and we got some trees. And the comment says, you guys rock. Keep it up with,
[13:48.140 --> 13:50.060]  Oh, keep it up. We love your great spirit.
[13:50.100 --> 13:53.180]  Enjoy your lessons and wonderful and taming hosts. Then it says,
[13:53.180 --> 13:57.900]  I'm a female farmer and I straight up. Thank you. Job bless. Job bless.
[13:57.920 --> 14:00.500]  Much respect. A female farmer. That's great.
[14:00.780 --> 14:05.500]  I'm going to do a podcast in the very near future that focuses on females in the
[14:05.500 --> 14:09.220]  cannabis industry. I'll have a lovely female farmer on there. Uh,
[14:09.260 --> 14:12.020]  I hope you listened to that one. Thanks for telling me that I rock.
[14:12.060 --> 14:14.540]  It's always great to hear. I try to have a great spirit.
[14:14.540 --> 14:16.580]  I try to be a upbeat kind of dude.
[14:16.660 --> 14:20.980]  And I hope that the lessons and the other entertaining hosts keep everybody
[14:20.980 --> 14:23.900]  smiling. So thanks for the compliment and the comment. I love it. Uh,
[14:23.900 --> 14:26.340]  and everyday job, less Rastafari.
[14:26.860 --> 14:28.660]  Because that's all the comments we have got.
[14:28.660 --> 14:33.020]  I want to thank everybody who sent in a comment. I do truly appreciate it.
[14:33.020 --> 14:35.420]  If you'd like me to read one of your comments on a future episode,
[14:35.740 --> 14:38.460]  all you have to do is go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.020]  search for grow from your heart. It will pop up, click on that,
[14:42.500 --> 14:46.060]  find ratings and reviews, and then just go to the top. It says customer rating.
[14:46.060 --> 14:49.100]  This is right there. Click to rate, just give it a five star click right there.
[14:49.100 --> 14:50.100]  And then it says, write a review.
[14:50.140 --> 14:52.180]  You just click right there and you just type in some cool shit.
[14:52.620 --> 14:56.940]  Tell me what you really think. And I will read your comment on a future episode.
[14:57.620 --> 14:59.460]  All right, you guys, I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[14:59.500 --> 15:01.660]  So to remedy that I'm going to take a fat dab.
[15:01.700 --> 15:03.820]  I'm going to press pause for a second. And when I get back,
[15:03.860 --> 15:08.380]  we're going to read some emails, which will lead us into some grow lessons.
[15:08.580 --> 15:09.580]  Hang tight while I take a quick.
[15:12.020 --> 15:13.700]  Jump jump jump.
[15:15.300 --> 15:16.540]  Tell me where you get it from.
[15:16.700 --> 15:18.660]  I find your entrance from Papa.
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.900]  Yeah, let me, let me think.
[15:21.180 --> 15:28.840]  But I can say who's on your clothes is like a display.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.640]  I'm not sure. I don't see about night and day.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.080]  Would you be my only?
[15:33.080 --> 15:36.960]  And the only way we got to just smile on our face and say,
[15:37.200 --> 15:39.640]  you want to do the work, not want to play.
[15:39.840 --> 15:40.640]  I'm a right time.
[15:40.640 --> 15:42.320]  Man, she says you are one fist day.
[15:42.520 --> 15:44.520]  I'm going to walk like a champion.
[15:44.560 --> 15:45.800]  Talk like a champion.
[15:45.960 --> 15:47.000]  What a piece of money.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.520]  Girl, tell me where you get it from.
[15:48.640 --> 15:50.680]  I find your entrance from Papa.
[15:50.680 --> 15:51.200]  Bum bum.
[15:51.280 --> 15:52.200]  Yeah, let me in.
[15:52.200 --> 15:53.320]  Make out the thing where you are.
[15:53.320 --> 15:53.840]  We had fun.
[15:53.960 --> 15:55.280]  Walk like a champion.
[15:55.320 --> 15:56.600]  Talk like a champion.
[15:56.640 --> 15:57.600]  What a piece of money.
[15:57.600 --> 15:58.640]  Girl, how are you?
[16:06.810 --> 16:09.210]  All right, everybody, we are back, at least I'm mostly back.
[16:09.210 --> 16:11.050]  I just took a huge dab of G Funk.
[16:11.050 --> 16:13.010]  Oh, gee, I took the dab of G Funk.
[16:13.010 --> 16:13.930]  Oh, gee, live resident.
[16:13.930 --> 16:17.770]  And I dunked it into some super lemon haze from the clear.
[16:18.010 --> 16:21.170]  If you ever get the opportunity to dunk your dab into the clear,
[16:21.490 --> 16:22.850]  I highly recommend you do that.
[16:22.850 --> 16:24.370]  Big shout out to my friends at Turpex.
[16:24.650 --> 16:27.690]  Big, huge shout out to my friends at the clear and also shout out to my friend
[16:27.690 --> 16:31.890]  who helped me out with the clear concentrate that is straight from California.
[16:31.930 --> 16:33.010]  It is super tasty.
[16:33.290 --> 16:34.210]  I am impressed.
[16:34.650 --> 16:35.650]  Shout out to the whole crew.
[16:35.930 --> 16:36.370]  Thank you.
[16:36.930 --> 16:38.130]  So let's get down to some emails.
[16:38.130 --> 16:41.690]  You guys, this email was sent to me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[16:41.690 --> 16:44.250]  If you've got an email you'd like to send to me, please do it.
[16:44.290 --> 16:45.690]  I may read it on the show.
[16:46.090 --> 16:47.090]  This guy got smart.
[16:47.130 --> 16:50.490]  He wants some grow advice on a strain that I bred instead of sending it to the
[16:50.490 --> 16:54.410]  I read genetics email account, which gets so many emails every day.
[16:54.650 --> 16:56.930]  This guy snuck in and he got it to the grow from your heart
[16:57.330 --> 16:59.290]  at hotmail.com email address.
[16:59.690 --> 17:01.890]  This one is from, oh, he didn't sign it.
[17:02.250 --> 17:03.650]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name.
[17:03.690 --> 17:07.130]  I will not use your name unless, uh, unless you tell me to or something.
[17:07.130 --> 17:08.210]  I'm just not going to read your name.
[17:08.370 --> 17:09.370]  You know who you are, bro.
[17:09.770 --> 17:11.490]  Uh, he says still loving the show, man.
[17:11.490 --> 17:14.570]  I have a few harvests under my belt and I'm enjoying this new found passion.
[17:14.570 --> 17:15.170]  Immensely.
[17:15.450 --> 17:18.930]  I recently bought a pack of Dubwise from nature's green remedies is one.
[17:18.930 --> 17:22.410]  And was wondering if you had any advice for growing it indoors.
[17:22.770 --> 17:25.570]  I'm really looking for a Fino that shows the super silver haze,
[17:25.850 --> 17:27.810]  but I'm open to suggestions.
[17:28.210 --> 17:30.970]  It goes to list a little bit of his nutrients and his light.
[17:31.850 --> 17:35.810]  He mentioned some other strains that he's growing as if I have experience with those.
[17:36.090 --> 17:38.610]  No, I have not grown those particular strains.
[17:38.970 --> 17:40.650]  He goes on and says, keep up the great work.
[17:40.650 --> 17:44.370]  You've definitely helped me get better, cleaner medicine to a few people in my
[17:44.370 --> 17:44.850]  area.
[17:44.930 --> 17:45.690]  Take care.
[17:46.050 --> 17:46.210]  Bro.
[17:46.210 --> 17:48.250]  I'm proud of you for getting cleaner and better medicine.
[17:48.250 --> 17:49.170]  Thanks for listening.
[17:49.690 --> 17:52.930]  Uh, as for nature's green remedies, they are now known as the dank team.
[17:52.930 --> 17:56.490]  So if you're looking for high quality feminized or regular cannabis seeds,
[17:56.850 --> 17:58.610]  check out the dank team.com.
[17:58.610 --> 18:00.010]  I'm not sure what they've got going on.
[18:00.210 --> 18:03.250]  Sometimes they've got I region edX products in stock.
[18:03.690 --> 18:07.850]  Uh, your main question was, uh, you bought a pack of Dubwise and you're
[18:07.850 --> 18:10.410]  wondering if I've got any advice for growing that indoors.
[18:10.970 --> 18:14.290]  My first piece of advice will be that plant will get tall.
[18:14.410 --> 18:17.090]  That shit likes to get tall super quickly on you.
[18:17.130 --> 18:19.450]  When you put it into flower, it's going to double in size.
[18:19.450 --> 18:22.370]  So if you've got a three foot tall plant, when you put it into flower, you're
[18:22.370 --> 18:24.010]  going to have a six foot tall plant.
[18:24.330 --> 18:25.410]  Be prepared for that.
[18:25.690 --> 18:30.290]  If you've got short ceilings, maybe flower early, something I can recommend
[18:30.290 --> 18:32.730]  strongly that plant loves to be scrogged.
[18:32.730 --> 18:36.010]  If you put out a trellis, if you put out the screen and you let that plant grow
[18:36.010 --> 18:38.890]  into the screen, and then it's, if it tries to get taller than the screen, you
[18:38.890 --> 18:42.330]  grab a branch and push it back under the screen, bend it down, however you got to
[18:42.330 --> 18:44.090]  do it, weave it all the way through the screen.
[18:44.450 --> 18:48.850]  If you can make that plant six feet wide and only two feet tall, the plant will love
[18:48.850 --> 18:48.970]  it.
[18:49.330 --> 18:50.690]  It will produce a bunch of arms.
[18:50.690 --> 18:52.290]  It will produce a bunch of little buds for you.
[18:52.290 --> 18:52.850]  Not little buds.
[18:52.850 --> 18:56.130]  It'll produce a bunch of like pine cone sized buds at every bud site for you.
[18:56.490 --> 18:59.610]  So instead of one big glory Cola, you'll have a whole bunch of medium
[18:59.610 --> 19:02.090]  size, medium size pine cone buds.
[19:02.770 --> 19:04.770]  So scrog it out, stretch it out, give it some space.
[19:04.770 --> 19:05.810]  Don't let it get too tall.
[19:06.210 --> 19:08.450]  Also that fucker likes to get nitrogen deficient.
[19:08.450 --> 19:11.770]  If you see it yellowing up early in flower, step up your nitrogen.
[19:11.770 --> 19:12.530]  Don't be afraid.
[19:12.530 --> 19:14.090]  It can take a lot of nitrogen.
[19:14.850 --> 19:17.850]  Both of that plant's parents are heavy feeders and it will definitely
[19:17.850 --> 19:19.170]  eat up the nitrogen on you.
[19:19.450 --> 19:23.730]  So keep it short, scrog it flower early because it's going to get tall on you.
[19:24.210 --> 19:28.410]  Uh, give it plenty of nitrogen in the early starts of flower and let it go long
[19:28.410 --> 19:28.690]  enough.
[19:28.690 --> 19:31.650]  One thing people don't like to do with dub wise, they don't like to let it go long
[19:31.650 --> 19:32.010]  enough.
[19:32.210 --> 19:35.210]  That plant could probably go depending on the female you've got, they could go up
[19:35.210 --> 19:36.330]  to 77 days.
[19:36.570 --> 19:39.290]  If you need to take it at 70, go for it, but see what happens.
[19:39.610 --> 19:42.490]  Um, there's not a big problem with letting plants go too long.
[19:43.290 --> 19:44.570]  You can really see what they do.
[19:45.090 --> 19:45.450]  All right.
[19:46.250 --> 19:46.570]  Sorry.
[19:46.570 --> 19:49.010]  I'm choking off the dab I took just a minute ago, but I'm recovering.
[19:49.850 --> 19:50.810]  Dude, thank you for the email.
[19:50.810 --> 19:51.770]  I truly appreciate it.
[19:52.050 --> 19:54.530]  I don't know if you want me to say your name on the air or not, so I'm not going
[19:54.530 --> 19:54.930]  to do that.
[19:54.930 --> 19:55.690]  You know who you are.
[19:55.730 --> 19:56.970]  Big shout out, big fist bump.
[19:57.250 --> 19:58.610]  I hope I answered your questions.
[19:59.010 --> 20:02.530]  Uh, check out the dank team.com when you need more beans.
[20:03.090 --> 20:04.650]  All right, well, I'm going to move on to the next email.
[20:04.650 --> 20:06.370]  You guys, this one came from our friend, Mike.
[20:06.410 --> 20:06.970]  Oh, Mike.
[20:07.010 --> 20:08.570]  Oh, has emailed us before this time.
[20:08.570 --> 20:10.330]  He's not as happy as he was in the past.
[20:10.810 --> 20:12.290]  Here's what Michael has to say.
[20:12.290 --> 20:14.650]  Love the podcast, but it has sucked lately.
[20:14.650 --> 20:17.610]  I know you have a new gig that keeps you busy, but if you aren't going to keep up
[20:17.610 --> 20:19.250]  the quality, then maybe take a break.
[20:19.570 --> 20:22.530]  The last few have been lackluster to say the least.
[20:22.810 --> 20:24.370]  What happened to all the old regulars?
[20:24.410 --> 20:25.770]  White Mike is not around anymore.
[20:25.770 --> 20:26.730]  What's up with that?
[20:27.050 --> 20:29.490]  Hope you get back to the grow talk soon.
[20:30.530 --> 20:32.410]  Uh, I apologize if you don't like the show, bro.
[20:32.410 --> 20:35.930]  There was one week when I had a guest lined up and at the last minute I called my
[20:35.930 --> 20:36.250]  guest.
[20:36.250 --> 20:37.330]  I was like, you want to come do a show?
[20:37.330 --> 20:38.730]  And he's like, bro, I had to go to the hospital.
[20:38.730 --> 20:39.970]  He had some medical issues.
[20:39.970 --> 20:41.370]  I had the recording gear ready.
[20:41.410 --> 20:42.450]  I was hoping he'd be on the show.
[20:42.690 --> 20:44.010]  I cannot blame it on the dude.
[20:44.330 --> 20:45.450]  He fucking had a medical issue.
[20:45.450 --> 20:46.290]  He had to take off.
[20:46.570 --> 20:48.730]  I had my friends, Carlos and Alan come over.
[20:48.810 --> 20:51.690]  I know that wasn't the most amazing podcast, but we put out a show for you.
[20:51.690 --> 20:53.290]  We did the best we could with what we had.
[20:53.730 --> 20:56.090]  Uh, the next show was Bobo blaster co that show was fun.
[20:56.450 --> 20:59.130]  I think those are the two shows when he said they were lackluster because there
[20:59.130 --> 21:00.250]  wasn't much grow info.
[21:00.250 --> 21:01.610]  It was just me and my bros hanging out.
[21:02.130 --> 21:05.290]  Uh, it's cannabis news, education and conversation.
[21:05.330 --> 21:06.770]  Those episodes were conversation, bro.
[21:06.770 --> 21:07.970]  Sometimes that shit's going to happen.
[21:08.370 --> 21:11.490]  Uh, not every episode is going to be an encyclopedia of cannabis knowledge.
[21:11.530 --> 21:12.770]  I do hope you keep listening.
[21:13.130 --> 21:16.690]  Uh, we've gotten good emails from you before, so I hope you stick around.
[21:17.130 --> 21:20.450]  Uh, you cannot say that the episode with Sean last time was
[21:20.450 --> 21:22.210]  not loaded with information.
[21:22.410 --> 21:24.050]  So there was your cannabis education.
[21:24.570 --> 21:28.090]  Uh, the other two episodes were conversation and he got plenty of news
[21:28.330 --> 21:29.330]  that people are bored with the news.
[21:29.330 --> 21:31.610]  I know that, but sometimes it's my duty to bring you the news.
[21:31.730 --> 21:33.370]  So I bring it all to you.
[21:33.650 --> 21:37.050]  Maybe not all of it is your flavor, but I still hope, uh, you listen.
[21:37.050 --> 21:37.810]  What happened to Mike?
[21:37.810 --> 21:39.050]  Mike's got a new child, bro.
[21:39.050 --> 21:40.690]  Mike's got a job and a new baby.
[21:41.090 --> 21:43.610]  Uh, Mike doesn't find it a priority to be on the podcast.
[21:43.610 --> 21:47.530]  I'm sure that that child and his family are number one, uh, then the
[21:47.530 --> 21:49.050]  job and then his life somewhere.
[21:49.050 --> 21:51.610]  And then sort of like probably 25th or 30th on the list.
[21:51.610 --> 21:52.770]  I hope is my podcast.
[21:53.250 --> 21:54.210]  Uh, Mike's got a life.
[21:54.530 --> 21:55.410]  He's a busy man.
[21:55.890 --> 21:58.290]  Uh, Jesse's fucking busy working all those people.
[21:58.290 --> 21:59.050]  We all have jobs.
[21:59.050 --> 22:01.770]  We've all kind of, uh, we all grew.
[22:01.810 --> 22:04.610]  We all got on a podcast and made ourselves known and we've expanded.
[22:04.610 --> 22:06.490]  We're all doing our own projects now and we're tied up.
[22:06.890 --> 22:09.290]  And yes, I do have a gig that keeps me busy.
[22:09.970 --> 22:12.530]  Uh, but I use a lot of that content and that stuff that I learned
[22:12.530 --> 22:14.530]  at that gig for this podcast.
[22:14.530 --> 22:15.330]  So it is contributing.
[22:15.330 --> 22:19.650]  It's keeping me busy, but it's making the show have content as well.
[22:19.890 --> 22:20.650]  Mike, I apologize.
[22:20.650 --> 22:21.570]  You don't like the show as well.
[22:21.570 --> 22:22.210]  Sometimes.
[22:22.810 --> 22:24.530]  Uh, I hope I didn't lose you as a listener.
[22:25.010 --> 22:27.610]  Um, yeah, thanks for the letter.
[22:27.930 --> 22:28.570]  Sorry, man.
[22:28.610 --> 22:28.890]  Shit.
[22:28.930 --> 22:29.450]  I hope you like it.
[22:29.730 --> 22:30.130]  All right, you guys.
[22:30.250 --> 22:32.010]  So we are, we're always going to have one negative email.
[22:32.010 --> 22:33.170]  I'm not going to hide it from you or nothing.
[22:33.170 --> 22:33.930]  That shit's going to happen.
[22:34.650 --> 22:36.650]  Uh, let's keep moving.
[22:37.570 --> 22:39.730]  This podcast comes with a totally different tone.
[22:40.130 --> 22:41.530]  This one says you're awesome.
[22:41.610 --> 22:42.690]  Help and advice.
[22:43.210 --> 22:45.450]  Uh, it says, Hey Jeff, firstly, I want to say thank you.
[22:45.770 --> 22:47.730]  Thanks for such an awesome podcast.
[22:47.730 --> 22:48.770]  You know, your shiz.
[22:50.050 --> 22:52.090]  And then he also says, if you're taking your time to read this,
[22:52.090 --> 22:53.370]  then I greatly appreciate it.
[22:53.690 --> 22:54.810]  If not, then no sweat.
[22:54.810 --> 22:55.850]  I know you're a busy guy.
[22:55.850 --> 22:56.610]  I can relate.
[22:56.890 --> 22:59.250]  He said, I recently found your podcast and have been listening
[22:59.250 --> 23:01.050]  at work for about two weeks now, bro.
[23:01.050 --> 23:02.170]  Do they know you're listening at work?
[23:02.730 --> 23:05.810]  He also says, uh, going through a lot of your shows and listening to
[23:05.810 --> 23:07.890]  them by title rather than in order.
[23:08.490 --> 23:13.290]  I've took so much of your advice on board and made so many notes, but it just doesn't
[23:13.290 --> 23:17.010]  seem to cut it when compared to direct advice, I found myself researching
[23:17.010 --> 23:20.810]  dozens of new things, which leads me to more unanswered questions.
[23:21.930 --> 23:25.530]  Uh, that statement right there is partly what inspired me to do a podcast.
[23:25.890 --> 23:29.490]  Uh, I can probably go to any forum on the internet that talks about growing
[23:30.450 --> 23:33.570]  and I could throw up a random question, just anything about growing weed.
[23:33.930 --> 23:36.410]  And I'd probably get seven to 10 replies pretty quickly.
[23:36.770 --> 23:41.290]  And I would say that 50, uh, 50% of those replies would be bullshit.
[23:41.290 --> 23:43.490]  That would actually cause me more harm than good.
[23:43.770 --> 23:45.250]  So that is the problem with the internet.
[23:45.250 --> 23:49.410]  When you go, uh, researching cannabis on the internet, you do end up in a wormhole
[23:49.410 --> 23:52.570]  or what we like to call the K hole of just researching more and more and more
[23:52.570 --> 23:56.530]  and more, and then you have to go debunk the first thing that you read and go
[23:56.530 --> 23:59.370]  research everything else to make sure it all matches up the internet can
[23:59.370 --> 24:00.290]  be a real bitch like that.
[24:00.290 --> 24:02.250]  So that's why I came on with a podcast.
[24:02.250 --> 24:03.690]  I wanted to make some of those things clear.
[24:03.690 --> 24:06.170]  I feel like I know what I'm talking about and I try not to give you any
[24:06.170 --> 24:08.330]  advice that would destroy your garden.
[24:09.290 --> 24:13.250]  So, uh, I totally understand what you mean about having to do more research.
[24:13.250 --> 24:14.410]  Let me keep reading with your email.
[24:14.410 --> 24:15.330]  I'm kind of ranty today.
[24:15.730 --> 24:18.970]  Uh, it goes on to say many moons ago, I grew for a few years and had some
[24:18.970 --> 24:22.090]  awesome results, but now I'm doing it totally different and I don't really
[24:22.090 --> 24:23.410]  remember the important info.
[24:23.410 --> 24:27.450]  So if you're not too busy, I'd like to tell you my, my small setup and info
[24:27.450 --> 24:31.330]  and ask you a few questions and see if you can shine a light on things for me.
[24:31.730 --> 24:33.970]  I wish I had your skillset and know-how.
[24:33.970 --> 24:37.410]  So any advice, tips, and recommendations whatsoever will be
[24:37.410 --> 24:39.290]  implemented and greatly appreciated.
[24:39.290 --> 24:41.130]  I understand if you're too busy, dude, let me know.
[24:41.530 --> 24:42.090]  Thanks.
[24:42.210 --> 24:43.090]  Love the podcast.
[24:43.090 --> 24:43.650]  It's awesome.
[24:43.650 --> 24:44.490]  Kind regards.
[24:44.490 --> 24:45.370]  And I'm not going to say your name.
[24:45.370 --> 24:46.370]  Cause I don't know if you want me to.
[24:47.090 --> 24:51.810]  Uh, my, uh, my advice would be just what you're doing when you do go to the
[24:51.810 --> 24:55.370]  internet and you read some stuff, be careful of what you're reading.
[24:55.890 --> 24:57.450]  I've said this before on the podcast.
[24:57.450 --> 25:00.650]  If you read something and you think you're going to do it, go smoke a joint
[25:00.650 --> 25:03.470]  and think about it, think about what you're going to do to your crop.
[25:03.490 --> 25:06.070]  Think about what that's going to do in five to seven days.
[25:06.270 --> 25:08.370]  Think about what that's going to do to your plant.
[25:08.610 --> 25:11.810]  When you try to flower it, think about the whole cycle of your plant.
[25:11.810 --> 25:12.870]  When you do whatever you're going to do.
[25:12.870 --> 25:14.950]  If you're going to cut something, you can't uncut it.
[25:15.290 --> 25:17.450]  If you're going to feed it something, you can't unfeed it.
[25:18.010 --> 25:19.510]  So just go smoke a joint.
[25:20.170 --> 25:22.290]  Think seriously about what you're going to do to your plant.
[25:22.290 --> 25:23.330]  Have a reason for it.
[25:23.330 --> 25:25.850]  Don't just do something to your plant to do something.
[25:25.850 --> 25:28.490]  Have a thought out reason, have a method to your madness.
[25:28.750 --> 25:30.610]  So that's probably my first piece of advice.
[25:30.610 --> 25:32.890]  Research it and have a reason why you're going to do it.
[25:33.410 --> 25:37.770]  Think about it, smoke a joint, think about it again, take a dab, think about it again.
[25:38.450 --> 25:39.210]  Uh, and then try it.
[25:39.210 --> 25:43.570]  And if you're going to try something new, maybe don't try it on every plant in the crop.
[25:43.570 --> 25:46.010]  If you're going to feed a new nutrient, if you're going to do a new pruning
[25:46.010 --> 25:48.930]  technique, maybe just pick one plant, label that one.
[25:49.130 --> 25:51.610]  I like to just put a piece of white duct tape with a star on it.
[25:51.890 --> 25:54.650]  And then in my notes, in my notebook, I write the plant with the stars, the one
[25:54.650 --> 25:58.770]  that I pee in every morning, and then you see how it reacts to that and you wait a
[25:58.770 --> 26:01.890]  couple of weeks or depending on what you do, sometimes you'll know by tomorrow
[26:01.890 --> 26:04.330]  morning, you'll be like, Oh, don't ever do that to that plant again.
[26:04.330 --> 26:06.690]  It got really mad, but now you learned something.
[26:07.030 --> 26:09.990]  You've got one fucked up plant, but you've still got the rest of the crop to recover.
[26:09.990 --> 26:11.170]  That stuff will still be there.
[26:11.370 --> 26:12.170]  You can harvest that.
[26:12.170 --> 26:12.930]  You can keep going.
[26:13.210 --> 26:14.690]  So experiment with one planet at a time.
[26:14.690 --> 26:16.210]  That's some advice I could give you.
[26:16.850 --> 26:21.170]  Uh, if you would like to email me the rest of your setup, uh, send me the
[26:21.170 --> 26:24.210]  size of your setup, what kind of light you're using, what kind of nutrients
[26:24.210 --> 26:25.570]  you're using, send me that stuff.
[26:25.970 --> 26:27.650]  And I will try to get you some advice.
[26:27.650 --> 26:29.690]  I will give the advice on this podcast.
[26:29.690 --> 26:32.370]  What you're doing is you're creating content with me and for me.
[26:32.970 --> 26:34.410]  Uh, I'm going to help you out.
[26:34.410 --> 26:37.030]  You're going to help me out and it's going to help out more listeners.
[26:37.030 --> 26:37.990]  So send me your info.
[26:38.730 --> 26:41.890]  Uh, let me know what kind of soil or soilless mix or hydro kit you're using.
[26:42.290 --> 26:43.810]  Uh, give me some info to work with.
[26:44.290 --> 26:47.850]  Uh, and then we will get a podcast out aimed at you and other folks in your
[26:47.850 --> 26:51.450]  situation, and hopefully we can get people growing better cannabis.
[26:52.090 --> 26:54.010]  Uh, I hope there was some useful advice in there.
[26:54.090 --> 26:55.370]  I'm in a rambly mood today.
[26:55.730 --> 26:55.930]  All right.
[26:55.930 --> 26:56.730]  I've got another email.
[26:56.730 --> 26:59.090]  This is probably the last email for this episode.
[26:59.530 --> 27:01.970]  Uh, we're getting up on 27 minutes right now.
[27:01.970 --> 27:05.170]  So this email goes like this.
[27:05.170 --> 27:06.970]  Yo Jeff, it's your boy from South Florida.
[27:06.970 --> 27:11.290]  Again, I emailed you only one time before, but like I said, in that email, I never
[27:11.290 --> 27:14.410]  met you, but I feel I know you big dog.
[27:14.610 --> 27:16.170]  Here's a handle to remember me by.
[27:16.170 --> 27:17.090]  And then he says his name.
[27:17.370 --> 27:20.970]  He says, anyway, man, I was wondering if you can explain a few things to me.
[27:21.490 --> 27:24.370]  Uh, you can email me back or you can put it on a future show if you like.
[27:24.410 --> 27:25.090]  Well, here it is, bro.
[27:25.090 --> 27:28.770]  He says, I wanted to know about salves and rubs.
[27:29.010 --> 27:31.370]  I get horrible knee, leg, and right hand pain.
[27:31.370 --> 27:33.570]  I swear I'm going to have arthritis when I get older.
[27:33.570 --> 27:34.970]  I'm only 31 now.
[27:35.330 --> 27:36.490]  Anyway, do they work?
[27:36.490 --> 27:37.610]  What's the best kind?
[27:37.850 --> 27:41.210]  Do you have any firsthand experience with it or do any of your boys?
[27:41.570 --> 27:42.610]  So that's the first question.
[27:42.610 --> 27:43.810]  He asked a couple of questions.
[27:44.250 --> 27:47.250]  Uh, the first question is about salves.
[27:47.250 --> 27:49.130]  He wants to know if they work.
[27:49.890 --> 27:52.170]  Honestly, I was skeptical of the topicals.
[27:52.170 --> 27:53.610]  I didn't think they would do anything.
[27:54.010 --> 27:58.530]  Uh, but our good friends at Apothecana gave me a bottle of their Apothecana
[27:58.530 --> 28:02.770]  pain cream, it was the red labeled pain-free cream, and I actually gave
[28:02.850 --> 28:06.050]  somebody a back massage with it because they had a shoulder problem.
[28:06.370 --> 28:10.250]  And as I was rubbing their shoulder, I noticed that my hands and my
[28:10.250 --> 28:12.210]  fingers were starting to feel fluffy.
[28:12.690 --> 28:17.610]  Like it felt like I had big padded gloves on my, my fingers and my hands were high.
[28:17.610 --> 28:20.410]  It was certainly working on my fingers.
[28:20.810 --> 28:25.010]  Uh, the person that I was massaging swore that it made her shoulder better.
[28:25.410 --> 28:28.610]  Uh, my mom works, uh, in a cold environment.
[28:28.610 --> 28:33.770]  She's always, she works in a freezer area and I got her some pain cream, some Mary
[28:33.770 --> 28:35.650]  Jane's pain cream, and she rubs it on.
[28:36.010 --> 28:39.570]  Uh, she uses it on her hands and she puts it on her elbows and knees.
[28:39.610 --> 28:42.290]  And she says it helps her a lot with the pain from that.
[28:42.290 --> 28:44.690]  So yes, that stuff does work.
[28:45.050 --> 28:49.450]  As for brands, uh, I would probably recommend Apothecana over anything else.
[28:49.810 --> 28:52.610]  Uh, second in line would be Mary Jane's pain cream.
[28:53.570 --> 28:54.930]  Uh, so I'm going to continue with the email.
[28:54.930 --> 28:57.570]  He asked me another question that I am not even going to read that part.
[28:57.570 --> 28:59.010]  The answer is hell no.
[28:59.450 --> 29:00.770]  Uh, you know what she asked me.
[29:00.890 --> 29:05.370]  Um, then he says, oh, also, dude, you mentioned that you're going to have arthritis.
[29:05.850 --> 29:08.250]  Um, a lot of that could be treated by your diet.
[29:08.250 --> 29:10.850]  I know you probably don't want to hear it, but there are a lot of things that
[29:10.850 --> 29:12.850]  you're eating that are causing inflammation.
[29:13.250 --> 29:17.850]  I would read about what like foods that cause inflammation, like gluten, sodas,
[29:18.010 --> 29:20.690]  things like that will cause your inflammation, which will make your hands
[29:20.690 --> 29:24.090]  hurt more, maybe if you cut some of that stuff out, added a little bit of water
[29:24.090 --> 29:25.930]  to your diet, that'll probably help.
[29:26.450 --> 29:30.050]  So I'm going to continue and look for more questions in your email.
[29:30.050 --> 29:30.690]  Cause it's long.
[29:30.690 --> 29:31.890]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[29:31.890 --> 29:35.330]  He says, also, I wanted to know what are the best strains for
[29:35.330 --> 29:37.490]  pain, inflammation, and anxiety.
[29:38.370 --> 29:42.490]  Uh, good strains for pain and inflammation or anything with a lot of CBD in it.
[29:43.530 --> 29:48.090]  Um, strains like Harlequin strains, like Charlotte's web, uh, strains like
[29:48.090 --> 29:54.570]  Kush tonic or Canada tonic or anything high in CBD will be very good for your
[29:54.570 --> 29:58.050]  inflammation and your pain, and it will also help with your anxiety.
[29:58.770 --> 30:03.650]  Uh, one of my favorite strains to smoke to come, uh, it's a sativa dominant strain,
[30:03.650 --> 30:05.090]  but it makes my anxiety.
[30:05.170 --> 30:08.210]  If I'm nervous about going somewhere, sometimes I just got to go places.
[30:08.210 --> 30:09.810]  I don't want to go and I don't want to talk to people.
[30:09.810 --> 30:10.690]  I'm just in that mood.
[30:11.050 --> 30:15.610]  If I smoke some tangy or some jelly bean that really puts me in like a
[30:15.610 --> 30:17.250]  social chatty sort of a mood.
[30:17.250 --> 30:19.370]  So something like that would really help you.
[30:19.810 --> 30:21.770]  I'm going to continue reading more parts of your email.
[30:21.770 --> 30:23.450]  Cause you asked a whole bunch of stuff.
[30:23.810 --> 30:24.730]  You ask a weird question.
[30:24.730 --> 30:27.650]  It says, does I read currently have any med strains?
[30:27.970 --> 30:29.410]  And if so, what did they treat?
[30:30.010 --> 30:35.290]  Um, I think all cannabis grown can be is a medical strain.
[30:35.330 --> 30:38.770]  It's just, uh, just marketing is what some people say.
[30:38.770 --> 30:39.810]  This is a medical strain.
[30:39.810 --> 30:40.770]  It's all medicinal.
[30:40.770 --> 30:41.850]  It's all got THC.
[30:41.850 --> 30:43.170]  It's all got some sort of.
[30:43.810 --> 30:46.530]  Rat ratio of cannabinoids and terpenoids in there.
[30:46.530 --> 30:47.210]  It's all medical.
[30:47.210 --> 30:49.170]  So that's, that's kind of a strange question.
[30:49.650 --> 30:52.490]  Uh, does it mean, is it sold at a dispensary or what qualifies
[30:52.490 --> 30:55.450]  a strain is medical email me back and tell me what you mean by that.
[30:55.770 --> 30:56.730]  I think I know what you mean.
[30:56.730 --> 30:57.530]  They're all medical.
[30:57.930 --> 31:02.410]  So yes, all of my strains are medical or they're also all recreational.
[31:02.490 --> 31:05.210]  Everything I bred could be used for recreation or medicine.
[31:05.290 --> 31:05.970]  Or both.
[31:06.410 --> 31:09.250]  Uh, when I smoke, it's a little bit of both, honestly, it's a 50,
[31:09.250 --> 31:12.490]  50 mix of recreational and medical.
[31:12.490 --> 31:12.970]  I'm smoking.
[31:12.970 --> 31:13.850]  Cause I like to smoke.
[31:14.170 --> 31:16.450]  I partially just like the ritual of hanging out with my bros
[31:16.450 --> 31:17.770]  and taking some dabs and laughing.
[31:18.210 --> 31:21.210]  I also like getting a nice head high and being giggly and having
[31:21.210 --> 31:22.490]  a stupid grin on my face.
[31:23.010 --> 31:26.330]  Uh, and then I also like that when I smoke, I have pain and I have some,
[31:26.570 --> 31:30.570]  uh, issues and those issues go away when I smoke or at least start alleviated.
[31:30.890 --> 31:34.290]  So it's a nice mix of recreational and medicinal.
[31:34.330 --> 31:35.970]  So any plant could be both.
[31:36.330 --> 31:38.410]  So let's get a little more into your email.
[31:38.650 --> 31:40.450]  He says, I got one last question, brah.
[31:40.650 --> 31:44.930]  I hear that a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio strains are good for that.
[31:44.930 --> 31:48.170]  And he's referring to the pain, inflammation, anxiety.
[31:48.530 --> 31:52.610]  He says, but I guess my question is if I buy a 10 pack of a strain, and I'm
[31:52.610 --> 31:54.690]  not going to say the name of the strain that you put in the email, cause I don't
[31:54.690 --> 31:56.570]  want to include that into our conversation.
[31:57.010 --> 32:01.530]  I says, if I buy a 10 pack of a strain, let's say I get a 10 pack of
[32:01.530 --> 32:03.210]  non-femme seeds and I pop them all.
[32:03.210 --> 32:05.410]  Let's say they all germ and turn out female.
[32:05.410 --> 32:07.530]  And let's say they are all different phenos.
[32:07.850 --> 32:10.690]  Does that ratio of one-to-one change within the progeny?
[32:10.730 --> 32:13.290]  If so, how do you know what you were getting?
[32:13.290 --> 32:13.930]  Exactly.
[32:13.930 --> 32:14.810]  Get my question.
[32:14.810 --> 32:19.490]  Lots of seed banks provide ratios, but even I know that I'm probably not going
[32:19.490 --> 32:23.530]  to get that same plant in the pick, but I will get the genes.
[32:23.530 --> 32:25.530]  And then he says, sorry for the long ass email.
[32:25.530 --> 32:26.530]  Much love to you, homie.
[32:26.850 --> 32:27.770]  Keep up the good work.
[32:27.770 --> 32:32.050]  One of these days I'm going to go to Colorado and I'd love to meet you.
[32:32.170 --> 32:33.770]  And he says, no homo, no homo, bro.
[32:33.770 --> 32:34.650]  I'd love to meet you too, bro.
[32:34.650 --> 32:35.250]  Fist bump.
[32:35.610 --> 32:38.650]  Uh, and then he says, and do a dab with you or maybe not probably just
[32:38.650 --> 32:42.210]  burn leaf, like usual dads are a little scary, especially when
[32:42.210 --> 32:43.570]  you have panic and anxiety.
[32:44.050 --> 32:46.730]  Uh, bro, I truly appreciate that long ass email.
[32:46.730 --> 32:48.490]  And I'm going to answer your last question there.
[32:49.210 --> 32:52.690]  If you bought a 10 pack of seeds that were advertised to have a one-to-one
[32:52.690 --> 32:56.850]  THC to CBD ratio, and you were lucky enough to get all females.
[32:56.850 --> 32:58.170]  Well, I don't know about lucky enough.
[32:58.170 --> 32:59.690]  I'd hope for a male in there cause I'm a breeder.
[32:59.930 --> 33:02.690]  I'd want a couple of males to choose from hopefully three to pick from.
[33:03.090 --> 33:05.650]  But if you got that pack of 10 females that you're hoping for,
[33:06.050 --> 33:07.010]  then you flower them out.
[33:07.610 --> 33:11.970]  The only way you're going to know what type of CBD to THC ratios you actually
[33:11.970 --> 33:15.610]  got are by flowering those plants, drying and curing the buds and taking
[33:15.610 --> 33:18.690]  that finished product to a testing facility to test for you.
[33:18.850 --> 33:21.250]  That's the only way you're going to guarantee what you've got.
[33:21.970 --> 33:25.970]  Um, the best way to do it is to grow them out and keep the plant that works
[33:25.970 --> 33:27.810]  best for your medicinal needs.
[33:28.050 --> 33:31.410]  That may not be the one-to-one ratio, but you may find that golden nugget in
[33:31.410 --> 33:33.170]  there that works perfectly for you.
[33:33.570 --> 33:37.850]  So I guess to answer your question, you do have a good chance of
[33:37.850 --> 33:39.730]  getting exactly what's advertised.
[33:39.730 --> 33:43.410]  It depends on how much testing the breeder did before they released the
[33:43.410 --> 33:49.050]  strains, and it also kind of depends on how much stabilization the breeder
[33:49.050 --> 33:50.570]  did before they released the strain.
[33:50.570 --> 33:54.210]  Sometimes you can make an F1 that comes out nice and uniform.
[33:54.210 --> 33:58.330]  Sometimes you make an F1 that throws out phenotypes that are all over the place.
[33:58.690 --> 34:03.170]  Sometimes that F2 will throw out even more variation, but that F3,
[34:03.170 --> 34:04.330]  you'll start narrowing it down.
[34:04.330 --> 34:05.530]  You start narrowing it down.
[34:06.010 --> 34:10.930]  Um, if the breeder does it right, you should get what's advertised very
[34:10.930 --> 34:13.130]  regularly, but you'll have to do the pheno hunting.
[34:13.450 --> 34:14.530]  That's what you're going to have to do.
[34:14.530 --> 34:19.730]  And don't rely too much on the numbers as much as what it does for you.
[34:20.170 --> 34:24.090]  Like put them all, grow all the plants, dry them, cure them.
[34:24.610 --> 34:28.250]  And label them ABC, whatever, give them a number and then smoke them.
[34:28.570 --> 34:30.970]  And then figure out which one of those you like.
[34:30.970 --> 34:33.970]  And don't let the looks of the plant, the color of the plant.
[34:33.970 --> 34:35.130]  Don't let that be your judge.
[34:35.130 --> 34:37.290]  Be let the effects be your judge.
[34:37.290 --> 34:40.170]  So you will have a good chance of getting that one.
[34:40.170 --> 34:42.050]  I'm getting off topic, but you will have a good chance of
[34:42.050 --> 34:43.530]  getting what was advertised.
[34:44.050 --> 34:45.570]  But it's hard to guarantee it.
[34:45.570 --> 34:46.610]  It depends on the breeder.
[34:46.770 --> 34:49.650]  It depends on the conditions in your grow room.
[34:50.290 --> 34:53.690]  Phenotypical expression is very much based on your grow room.
[34:53.690 --> 34:58.130]  If your room is too humid or too dry or too hot or too cold, you're not going to
[34:58.130 --> 35:02.730]  get those phenotypes that were advertised because those were grown under probably
[35:02.730 --> 35:06.010]  perfect conditions if they were done by professional breeders, they've got
[35:06.010 --> 35:07.370]  very great rooms to grow in.
[35:07.770 --> 35:10.170]  So they grew that plant to its full potential.
[35:10.170 --> 35:12.650]  They got the phenotypical expression they were looking for.
[35:12.650 --> 35:14.730]  So you've got to get your room up to par also.
[35:15.290 --> 35:17.530]  But the short answer is yes.
[35:17.970 --> 35:22.650]  The different phenos will carry, will possibly carry different ratios of THC to
[35:22.650 --> 35:29.330]  CBD. I've seen it very, very widely in F1 hybrids made by friends of mine, but I've
[35:29.330 --> 35:34.610]  seen them stabilize it down to where we can get quite uniform seeds that are high
[35:34.610 --> 35:37.090]  in CBD. So that's the long answer.
[35:37.130 --> 35:39.930]  I wish I had a shorter answer for you because I feel like that one took forever.
[35:40.130 --> 35:41.610]  Dude, I definitely appreciate the email.
[35:41.610 --> 35:43.010]  You gave me a lot of great content.
[35:43.650 --> 35:44.250]  Shout out to you.
[35:44.250 --> 35:46.730]  I'm not going to say your name on the show, but I encourage you to send me some more
[35:46.730 --> 35:49.530]  emails. I encourage everybody out there to send me an email.
[35:49.530 --> 35:51.050]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[35:51.130 --> 35:53.490]  If you've got something to say, I would love to hear it.
[35:54.010 --> 35:55.730]  I want to thank everybody who sent me an email.
[35:55.730 --> 35:58.450]  Once again, I hope to hear from more people in the future.
[35:58.450 --> 36:00.570]  You guys, my throat is going completely dry.
[36:00.570 --> 36:03.850]  I'm going to get some water, take a bunch of dabs and chill out for the evening.
[36:03.850 --> 36:05.330]  I hope you guys are all kicking it, too.
[36:05.730 --> 36:07.530]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this episode.
[36:07.530 --> 36:09.250]  I'll be back in a few days with another show.
[36:09.450 --> 36:11.090]  I've got a great interview lined up.
[36:11.090 --> 36:13.890]  I don't want to talk about it because a lot of times things fall through and then I sound
[36:13.890 --> 36:17.090]  like I was talking shit. But I've got an interview lined up that I'm excited about.
[36:17.090 --> 36:19.010]  I've got a couple of great guests coming real soon.
[36:19.010 --> 36:21.450]  We're going to do an episode about how to deal with law enforcement.
[36:21.890 --> 36:25.770]  I've got an episode lined up about how to get your MED badge so that you can work in
[36:25.770 --> 36:27.450]  the legal industry here in Colorado.
[36:27.690 --> 36:30.570]  I hope to get Rob from Sour Seeds on the show real soon.
[36:30.570 --> 36:33.170]  And we will talk about selecting male plants for breeding.
[36:33.410 --> 36:35.090]  I've got a lot of stuff lined up, you guys.
[36:35.090 --> 36:39.210]  I'm lining up a live show at the Cana Canyon with our friend Fox.
[36:39.370 --> 36:40.850]  I hope to have an audience there.
[36:41.010 --> 36:42.250]  We're going to be interactive.
[36:42.250 --> 36:43.490]  We will take your questions.
[36:43.530 --> 36:44.930]  I will let you know when that's going to happen.
[36:44.930 --> 36:45.970]  We're finalizing a date.
[36:45.970 --> 36:47.530]  I'm waiting on word from the Cana Canyon.
[36:47.530 --> 36:48.410]  We'll get that going.
[36:48.690 --> 36:51.410]  Somebody asked me to do an episode about vitamin B and enzymes.
[36:51.930 --> 36:53.770]  I'm hoping to get Sean on the show for that one.
[36:53.930 --> 36:55.210]  He will have a lot to say.
[36:55.210 --> 36:58.890]  He's got a horticultural degree, a huge horticultural background.
[36:58.890 --> 37:01.370]  So he will have a lot to share on that one.
[37:01.810 --> 37:04.290]  I need to give one more huge shout out to our sponsor, Hitman Glass.
[37:04.290 --> 37:06.130]  Make sure you follow Hitman Glass on Instagram.
[37:06.130 --> 37:07.530]  It's at Hitman Glass Dougie.
[37:07.770 --> 37:12.730]  Also check out their website, www.hitmanglass.com and also support the Chalice
[37:12.730 --> 37:13.930]  Festival in California.
[37:14.290 --> 37:17.610]  The Chalice Festival, hash music and art.
[37:18.210 --> 37:20.930]  If you're interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you've got a product you'd
[37:20.930 --> 37:24.050]  like me to review on the show, send me an email, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[37:24.050 --> 37:26.570]  We'll get you all of the information you need.
[37:26.930 --> 37:27.130]  All right.
[37:27.130 --> 37:28.650]  That's all I've got for you this week, everybody.
[37:28.850 --> 37:29.410]  Much love.
[37:29.450 --> 37:30.130]  Big thanks.
[37:30.530 --> 37:32.610]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[37:32.610 --> 37:36.210]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.640]  I like my spin.
[37:54.640 --> 38:06.040]  Oh God, I got to tell you, that's why I'm staying with this ring.
[38:06.040 --> 38:08.040]  Take it easy.
[38:08.040 --> 38:26.000]  See, we're taking it easy.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  We're taking it slow.
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  Taking it easy.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  Got to take it slow.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  Take it easy.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  Take it easy.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  Take it easy.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.790]  Take it easy.
[38:53.790 --> 38:55.790]  Excuse me while I light my spliff.
[38:55.790 --> 38:59.790]  Oh God, I got to take a lift.
[38:59.790 --> 39:03.790]  From reality, I just can't drift.
[39:03.790 --> 39:07.790]  That's why I'm staying with this ring.
[39:07.790 --> 39:09.790]  Take it easy.
[39:09.790 --> 39:13.790]  Got to take it slow.
[39:13.790 --> 39:17.790]  Take it easy.
[39:17.790 --> 39:21.790]  Take it easy.
[39:21.790 --> 39:40.260]  Take it easy.
[39:40.260 --> 39:44.260]  Take it easy.
