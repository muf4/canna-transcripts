[00:44.880 --> 00:49.200]  Calm you know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing
[00:49.200 --> 00:54.280]  I just took a ridiculous dab of star dog batter from our friends at apothecary
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.360]  Farms on the label it says the product contains
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  63.2 percent THC and
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.160]  74% total cannabinoids
[01:02.160 --> 01:08.400]  I'm having a hard time keeping my eyes open wide enough to read the label because the dab I just took was ridiculous
[01:08.400 --> 01:11.160]  I'm gonna crack open the jar and give it a fresh smell. I
[01:11.760 --> 01:17.720]  Love star dog. I have always been a big fan of star dog this batter came out beautifully the first thing
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.800]  I notice is when I crack it open. It is a beautiful golden yellow color
[01:21.800 --> 01:26.560]  It looks like a nice piece of golden yellow cheesecake batter. It is delicious looking
[01:26.560 --> 01:29.980]  This is beautiful batter then this aroma hits me in the face
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.320]  There is a spicy watermelon gassy strawberry sort of a thing that punches me right in the face
[01:35.320 --> 01:41.320]  I really love it, then I took a dab of it, and it made me stoned as shit. I am stoned. I'm high
[01:41.320 --> 01:43.280]  I'm sitting down in the chair real mellow
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.720]  I'm kind of hunched over and my eyes are definitely squinty and bright red so I am
[01:47.920 --> 01:53.520]  Impressed and heavily medicated off of the star dog batter from our friends at apothecary farms
[01:53.840 --> 01:58.380]  Big shout out to all of my friends over there at apothecary farms while I'm doing shout outs
[01:58.380 --> 02:05.000]  Let's send a shout out to everybody who is working for or at a dispensary right now in the state of Colorado
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.960]  And I think in most states which offer medical and or recreational cannabis
[02:09.360 --> 02:16.420]  Medical and rec cannabis have been deemed essential businesses during this quarantine during the lockdown time of the kovat 19 virus
[02:16.460 --> 02:19.380]  So big shout out to all of my friends working in the industry
[02:19.580 --> 02:24.220]  Risking their health risking their lives to be out there to keep us supplied with medicine
[02:24.220 --> 02:29.100]  We do appreciate you also big shout out to everybody who is working to keep the world moving
[02:29.180 --> 02:34.260]  While most of us are hiding in our safe homes to keep ourselves safe and healthy. Thank you
[02:34.260 --> 02:39.940]  I know you're out there working your ass off. You're wearing extra personal protective equipment. You're probably wearing a mask
[02:39.940 --> 02:41.640]  You're probably scared shitless
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.580]  You probably have to come home and do extra shit at the end of the day just to make sure not to
[02:45.580 --> 02:53.260]  Contaminate your friends your family your home probably your children who knows what kind of environment you're coming home to potentially bringing home danger
[02:53.260 --> 02:57.840]  So I appreciate you. Thank you. There are a lot of extra steps that people have to take today
[02:57.840 --> 03:03.540]  It is not going unnoticed by me. I see it. Thank you. I know it's hard to deal with some shit right now
[03:03.540 --> 03:05.420]  So if you're taking extra precautions
[03:05.420 --> 03:09.040]  If you have to go to work if you work in the grocery stores the dispensaries
[03:09.040 --> 03:14.020]  The post office if you're delivering things right now if you're I got a grocery delivery today
[03:14.420 --> 03:16.420]  The grocery shopper did a damn good job
[03:16.700 --> 03:21.360]  Thank you all of those people that are doing those types of jobs and I can't remember everybody
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.540]  I just told you I took a giant dab if you're doing something out there putting yourself at risk
[03:25.540 --> 03:28.980]  And I didn't mention you I include you in that. Thank you. I need you
[03:28.980 --> 03:33.480]  We all need you you are keeping the world moving the rest of you if you don't have to go out there
[03:33.480 --> 03:37.940]  Keep your ass at home. Let's try to minimize social activity social interaction
[03:37.940 --> 03:41.020]  Let's minimize the movement and spread of this virus
[03:41.020 --> 03:43.900]  Hopefully soon we can all get back to our normal activities
[03:43.900 --> 03:49.580]  but the only way I feel that that is going to work is if we just stop spreading it or we all have to
[03:49.580 --> 03:55.940]  Get it and just get it as a normal virus a normal thing that our bodies adapt to which will probably have a huge
[03:56.140 --> 04:00.580]  Outcome that'll have a what's the word? I'm looking for an aftermath of fallout is the word I'm looking for
[04:00.580 --> 04:06.420]  I don't want to deal with that. I would rather everybody go inside and stop volleying this virus. Let's hang out
[04:06.420 --> 04:09.980]  All right enough ranting about this virus. I know we've all heard enough about that
[04:09.980 --> 04:13.300]  I want to thank everybody who's putting themselves at risk out there
[04:13.740 --> 04:19.380]  Especially all of the medical professionals who are working extra shifts who are having to witness and deal with all of this stuff
[04:19.380 --> 04:24.180]  Thank you guys. I do notice it and I do appreciate it now one positive thing
[04:24.180 --> 04:28.260]  I have noticed during this quarantine or this lockdown period this isolation time
[04:28.260 --> 04:32.620]  Whatever you want to call it what I have noticed is that many content creators
[04:33.180 --> 04:35.180]  podcasters YouTube video makers
[04:35.340 --> 04:43.700]  Instagrammers so many people have been making so much more great quality content being cooped up has inspired people to put out ideas that have
[04:43.700 --> 04:45.620]  Probably been in the back of their heads for a while
[04:45.620 --> 04:49.900]  They haven't had the time or the energy to do it. Now people are cooped up. They can't go to work
[04:49.900 --> 04:53.860]  They can't go to the park. They can't go to the gym. People are freaking out without going to the gym
[04:53.860 --> 04:57.500]  That is many people's biggest outlet. We can't go we close those immediately
[04:57.500 --> 05:02.860]  So there are so many great YouTube and Instagram videos and Instagram lives
[05:02.940 --> 05:09.260]  So many musicians and other artists are going live and doing their craft lives that we can participate and watch
[05:09.260 --> 05:15.640]  I think that is a great thing to see in this sort of a lockdown period all of the creative people all of the content
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.580]  Creators we are still creating content. We've still got all this creative energy and it's gonna come out
[05:20.580 --> 05:24.420]  We're gonna be cooped up and you're gonna see our energy come out in different creative ways
[05:24.420 --> 05:29.060]  So that's gonna be one of the silver linings to this weirdness. So I just try to find the positive
[05:29.060 --> 05:33.700]  That's one great thing that I have seen a lot of great artists are putting out things online
[05:34.140 --> 05:39.500]  Doing things interactively so that we can participate and they can still get their craft and their art out there
[05:39.500 --> 05:43.460]  For the people who are stuck at home. Now, we've got some kind of a release. We can't go to concerts
[05:43.460 --> 05:48.820]  We can't do comedy shows. So it's great to have people giving us some sort of stress relief you guys
[05:48.820 --> 05:51.820]  It's already six minutes into the podcast. I'm super rambly
[05:51.820 --> 05:57.260]  Let's move into the part of the podcast where we do some shoutouts to the folks who support the show on

[07:25.320 --> 07:29.720]  This is the part of the show where I read emails from my listeners
[07:29.720 --> 07:33.640]  If you have got a cannabis culture or cultivation question, I would love to hear from you
[07:33.640 --> 07:37.280]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[07:37.440 --> 07:43.320]  The first email on today's episode goes just like this. It says Rasta Jeff. I
[07:43.960 --> 07:48.840]  Appreciate what you've been telling your listeners about being safe with the cv-19 virus
[07:49.360 --> 07:52.200]  Serious respiratory infections are dangerous
[07:52.200 --> 07:59.240]  I contracted h1n1 11 years ago, and I thought I would die. I was off work for a month
[07:59.240 --> 08:05.600]  I am being particularly cautious since I am now a senior and in the danger zone
[08:05.920 --> 08:06.420]  Yes
[08:06.420 --> 08:10.160]  I've been trying to warn my audience to take this very seriously
[08:10.160 --> 08:12.160]  Many people are taking it as a joke
[08:12.200 --> 08:18.760]  Many people are not taking the appropriate precautions and they're putting other people at danger such as yourself
[08:18.760 --> 08:21.120]  Somebody who's already suffered a major
[08:21.600 --> 08:28.920]  Respiratory disease somebody who's already faced death and now somebody who is a senior who is in the danger zone and is well aware of
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.920]  It that has got to be scary to look outside and see dipshits running around putting you in danger
[08:33.920 --> 08:38.440]  That must put fear in you. There's also something very interesting. I took in this email
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.120]  I did not realize I had a large senior audience
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.400]  I've gotten several messages recently from people telling me that they're older than me or that they're seniors and they appreciate the show
[08:48.400 --> 08:54.040]  It is great knowing that I am helping out a broader audience. I am more broad audience than which I realized
[08:54.040 --> 08:59.600]  So thank you for adding that little detail into there. That does help me out. There is a lot more to the message
[08:59.600 --> 09:04.120]  It says I am attaching some photos of my golden goat. So our friend here is growing golden goat
[09:04.120 --> 09:08.920]  It says I picked golden goat because I live in Topeka and if you've listened to the story of golden goat
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.400]  Golden goat came from Topeka from a guy named. Mr. Dank. That is a great story
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.400]  So I'm glad you're growing the golden goat there in Topeka. I talks a little bit about the photos. They sent me
[09:18.400 --> 09:23.320]  We don't need to discuss too much of that. Then it says we're planning a vacation to the Buena Vista area
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.200]  Yeah, I'm sure that vacation may get delayed or adjusted keep in touch. We may be able to meet up
[09:28.200 --> 09:33.280]  They do ask if we can hang out during that trip. Yes, if things come together, we may be able to hang out
[09:33.360 --> 09:36.720]  Let's not make any arrangements that far with all this chaos
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.520]  Then it goes on to say in case you were looking for show topics
[09:40.520 --> 09:46.320]  I am wondering about budget growing in a hot room while I have a pretty good AC setup
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.360]  I can't add AC beyond the central air because the window unit will light leak and
[09:51.720 --> 09:57.160]  The freestanding AC may be beyond my budget this summer. So that's a very good question
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.160]  They wrap up the email with will keep up the good work and an update on your Mac project would be nice
[10:02.440 --> 10:07.880]  Then they wrap up the email with used to be cool big shout out to my friend used to be cool
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.400]  I see your name pop up quite a bit
[10:09.400 --> 10:15.200]  I did not realize you were a senior and I definitely did not know you survived the h1n1 virus
[10:15.200 --> 10:18.200]  I'm glad you made it through that. Hey, thank you for the great message
[10:18.200 --> 10:23.480]  And I'm glad that somebody out there appreciated my episode on the corona virus
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.800]  I got a couple of messages telling me to stop spreading fear and hype and stuff like that
[10:27.800 --> 10:31.840]  I tried to ignore it because I knew that I could stand behind the episode that I put out
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.760]  So thank you for the support and the feedback on that part of the email now, let's move on to the question
[10:37.760 --> 10:42.440]  You've got a grow space and it's getting too hot and you cannot add a window air conditioner
[10:42.760 --> 10:44.880]  Because it will possibly give you light leaks
[10:44.880 --> 10:51.240]  Also, I find they are very good opportunities for a thief all you have to do push or pull that air conditioner
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.320]  Now you've got an open window going in get what you need. You've got an in you've got an out
[10:55.360 --> 10:59.560]  Doesn't take very long it happens way too often those air conditioners are dangerous
[10:59.720 --> 11:05.760]  My first recommendation was going to be one of the portable air conditioners that has the hoses for an in and an out
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.800]  They are very useful. They are not super efficient on electricity and they are expensive
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.320]  But it says in here a freestanding AC may be out of my budget this summer
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.480]  So if we do not have the option to create cooler air
[11:19.520 --> 11:26.160]  The only option is to remove that hotter air and hopefully replace it with cooler ambient air
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.400]  From your main air conditioner in your house. It won't help to add more fans
[11:31.400 --> 11:37.920]  It won't help to just blow that heat around you're going to actually need to remove the heat or add colder air
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.840]  Hopefully we can do both in one move
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.280]  What I would recommend is getting a carbon filter and a blower either a four or a six inch inline fan
[11:47.440 --> 11:52.680]  Hook up the carbon filter to where the air is sucking through the filter then through your inline fan
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.160]  Then I would run ducting out of that grow space. I don't know if that grow space is in a closet
[11:58.160 --> 12:00.320]  I don't know if it's in a bedroom. I don't know where it's located
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.200]  You may need a hole you need some way to get that air out
[12:04.200 --> 12:10.160]  You need a four or six inch hole in a wall in the ceiling going up to the attic going out of that room
[12:10.160 --> 12:12.200]  We need to vent that air out of there
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.840]  Somehow move it as far as you can run that ducting possibly out of a window
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.340]  Be careful if you do run it out of the house
[12:19.800 --> 12:21.640]  Camouflage it cover it in some way
[12:21.640 --> 12:28.360]  Don't make it obvious for neighbors for thieves for the guy who comes and checks the meters the guy that checks the gas meter the water
[12:28.360 --> 12:30.880]  Meter the electric guy make sure it's covered up
[12:30.880 --> 12:33.440]  You never know who could end up in your yard on the side of your house
[12:33.560 --> 12:38.600]  Try to be smooth about that shit, but we've got to duct this hot air out of there somehow
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.200]  So we've hung a carbon filter we've got a blower
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.080]  We've got ducting running to another spot where we can dump this warm air
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.500]  When we plug in that blower it is going to move a lot of air that is going to cause displacement
[12:50.500 --> 12:54.320]  There's going to be air missing in your grow space. It will need to be replaced
[12:54.920 --> 12:59.960]  most of that air will replace itself by coming in through the crack underneath your door and the
[13:00.040 --> 13:05.120]  Gap in your door between the door and the door jamb if that blower is pulling a lot of air
[13:05.120 --> 13:08.240]  You may hear a little bit of whistling happening in there. That is not a problem
[13:08.240 --> 13:11.800]  That is just a sign of a lot of airflow and you were getting negative pressure
[13:11.800 --> 13:14.400]  It's trying to suck the door in which is not a bad thing
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.620]  What is also happening at that time is you are sucking fresh air into the room?
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.700]  Hopefully you were bringing cool air in from the rest of the house from the central air or whatever type of air conditioning
[13:25.700 --> 13:30.580]  You've got so I don't have a whole lot of details on this grow environment. Like I said earlier
[13:30.580 --> 13:35.560]  I don't know if this is a closet a bedroom an attic a basement. This could be any type of space
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.880]  What I do know is that we can't add an air conditioner so we cannot cool the air which means we have got to
[13:41.120 --> 13:46.300]  Remove the hot air and hopefully replace it with cooler air just by air displacement
[13:46.300 --> 13:53.300]  That would be my first approach the next approach may be to turn down the light or possibly replace the light
[13:53.300 --> 13:59.560]  Can you get a smaller light and run a lighter light in that room just for one season here in Colorado?
[13:59.560 --> 14:05.120]  I adjust my entire grow two times a year just based on the seasons in the summer
[14:05.120 --> 14:09.440]  I cannot run the same type of setup which I run in the winter and we are quickly
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.160]  Approaching the time of year where I have to start paying attention to the weather every day to think
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.880]  Oh do I need to start making those adjustments because once I make them they're done
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.260]  I'm not gonna go rebuild again and then rebuild again. It takes a little bit to do it
[14:22.260 --> 14:27.040]  So I have to pay attention to the weather. You may need to reconsider hanging a different light
[14:27.040 --> 14:31.920]  Maybe a smaller light if you're running an HID, maybe it's time for an LED if you're running an LED
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.840]  Maybe it's time for a smaller LED again. I don't know what you've started with
[14:35.840 --> 14:38.840]  So I don't know what to adjust to but that is an option
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.800]  Maybe run a smaller or if you've got multiple, maybe it's time for less lights
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.500]  Many of the modern lights have a switch. You could just turn them down a little bit
[14:47.500 --> 14:49.320]  Those will help cool the room for you
[14:49.320 --> 14:55.200]  Also, maybe consider using a ducted light if we're hanging ducks and a carbon filter the old ducted hoods
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.920]  Those work really well for keeping the room cooler
[14:58.600 --> 15:05.240]  Unfortunately, there are no real magic tricks when it comes to cooling a room the light creates heat that heat is going to be in
[15:05.240 --> 15:07.160]  The room there is no trick to
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.080]  Dissipating heat you either have to get it out of there or you have to fight it with an air conditioner
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.880]  You have to battle the heat somehow
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.520]  It sounds like you have got to duct the heat from the room if that is not an option
[15:17.720 --> 15:21.280]  Maybe reduce the amount of lights you are putting into that room
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.440]  That light is what is creating the heat reduce that you'll reduce your overall heat problem
[15:26.640 --> 15:31.160]  Now they did wrap up the email with an update on the Mac project would be nice
[15:31.160 --> 15:36.800]  I did make the Mac to arise. I took the Mac female the Mac one cut from Capulator
[15:36.800 --> 15:44.120]  I pollinated that with my arise my King Solomon male the first time I did that I did a very small plant
[15:44.120 --> 15:47.040]  I'm holding my hands up to show you how big it is. Can you see that?
[15:47.040 --> 15:50.840]  That's how tall the plant was the plant was maybe two feet tall at the most
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.080]  I pollinated the plant it got hit with a lot of pollen that plant made
[15:55.080 --> 16:00.720]  I think it was five or six seeds it made five that look good and one that kind of looks like it might go and
[16:00.720 --> 16:02.800]  I have not tried to germinate those yet
[16:02.800 --> 16:10.000]  However, I did put a larger Mac plant in the flowering room this time and I pollinated it with the King Solomon again
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.440]  I basically had that Mac plant leaning up against the male plant as it started to pollinate
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.840]  It got the very first dumps of pollen. It got the early pollination
[16:19.840 --> 16:22.840]  It looks like I probably had more success this time
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.240]  But I felt like the calyxes looked like they were seeded last time as well
[16:27.320 --> 16:31.920]  So it may be deceiving me once again, that is one of the best parts about breeding
[16:31.920 --> 16:34.560]  You don't know how many seeds there are until you cut it down
[16:34.600 --> 16:40.400]  You start sorting it out and you realize I pollinated right on time or I fucked up and missed the pollination point
[16:40.400 --> 16:43.800]  So I don't have a real update on the Mac to arise
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.480]  I didn't make enough seeds to make it worth my while last time there were a couple there to play with
[16:48.480 --> 16:51.280]  They don't look super healthy. They don't look super viable
[16:51.280 --> 16:56.000]  I didn't try to germinate them just so I don't break my own heart. They're still there at this point
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.880]  They are Schrodinger seeds. They could be alive. They could be dead. We don't know
[16:59.880 --> 17:03.840]  I can't cry over seeds that I don't know about yet, but they're there
[17:03.840 --> 17:07.520]  I've also attempted to make another batch if I do have a lot more
[17:07.520 --> 17:10.760]  I will play with them for sure and you know that I will let you know
[17:10.760 --> 17:12.320]  I'll let you know on social media
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.160]  You'll see how they look and of course, I will give you an update here on the grow from your heart podcast
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.400]  All right used to be cool. I want to thank you for the great email
[17:20.400 --> 17:22.920]  You set me off on a good rant there. Thank you for that
[17:22.920 --> 17:25.160]  I look forward to hearing from you again in the future
[17:25.160 --> 17:32.440]  And I also hope you stay safe and healthy and virus free my friends out there who are young and healthy who are not taking
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.700]  This seriously. This is one of the people who are at risk. Let's not get my friend used to be cool sick
[17:37.700 --> 17:42.960]  We need him around. It's a cool fucking dude. All right, let's move into email number two for this episode
[17:43.080 --> 17:50.040]  This one goes just like this. It says hey Jeff. My name is Riley. Feel free to use my name that makes it so easy
[17:50.040 --> 17:51.240]  Thank you, Riley
[17:51.240 --> 17:54.420]  It goes on to say I'm a medical patient here in Illinois
[17:54.420 --> 17:58.020]  And I recently had a plant Herm on me after it running too dry
[17:58.080 --> 18:03.160]  While I was out of town for a couple of days then he says at least that's why I think it hermed
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.760]  Unlikely, I don't think it hermed on you because it was too dry. I think there was another issue
[18:07.760 --> 18:09.120]  We will get to that in a moment
[18:09.120 --> 18:12.600]  He says I immediately cut this plant down and checked for signs of
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.560]  Pollination on my other plants and I thought I was in the clear until about one week later
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.000]  I noticed my two gorilla fucks were showing signs of pollination
[18:22.000 --> 18:29.560]  I'm cutting this crop down today and starting over and I wanted your advice on how I should be sterilizing my grow to avoid
[18:29.840 --> 18:30.920]  future
[18:30.920 --> 18:32.560]  Pollinations that is a great question
[18:32.560 --> 18:38.040]  There's more I want to cover in the next paragraph before I answer because this will contribute to part of the first question
[18:38.040 --> 18:41.120]  It says I am growing in a 10 by 10 spare bedroom
[18:41.120 --> 18:44.680]  Where I keep the door cracked during the daytime to keep the temperatures down
[18:44.680 --> 18:47.200]  I use grow tent frames to hang my lights
[18:47.200 --> 18:49.200]  But I only use the removable
[18:49.240 --> 18:56.240]  Flooring to set my plants on there is carpet in the bedroom as well as blackout curtains and black garbage bags for any additional
[18:56.680 --> 19:04.320]  Light leaks now since you immediately start talking about light leaks and you also mentioned that you were opening and closing this door during the day
[19:04.320 --> 19:08.080]  I am going to assume that at least once or twice
[19:08.440 --> 19:13.960]  You may have fallen asleep or got too stoned or got too involved with your video games or whatever it is you do
[19:13.960 --> 19:17.400]  I'm not judging you. I'm not blaming you. This is my stoner assumption
[19:17.480 --> 19:19.800]  Maybe once or twice two or three times
[19:19.840 --> 19:26.160]  You probably forgot to close that door at the right time and they got a little bit of light leak that light should have gone
[19:26.160 --> 19:32.400]  Off it should have gotten dark, but it didn't that is what I'm going to suspect led to your plants becoming hermaphrodites
[19:32.920 --> 19:38.960]  Honestly a plant that expresses hermaphroditic traits under a little bit of stress like that. It was a herm anyway
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.560]  It was carrying intersex traits
[19:40.560 --> 19:46.200]  All you had to do is give it the environment or give it the triggers to show you that that was in its genetic code
[19:46.200 --> 19:48.320]  So it is better off that you found out now
[19:48.360 --> 19:54.560]  It's gone not a big deal, but I assume it was from you leaving that door open. It was from a light leak
[19:54.560 --> 20:00.200]  I would not blame it on the plant getting too dry. It was more likely from a light problem
[20:00.200 --> 20:03.160]  It goes on to say if you need additional info, please let me know
[20:03.440 --> 20:09.080]  Thank you for the grow from your heart podcast as well as putting me on to embracing organics. Yes, my friends
[20:09.080 --> 20:14.760]  I am also on another show called embracing organics. We do embracing organics every Thursday
[20:14.760 --> 20:18.800]  It is a live show that happens from 7 to 9 Mountain Time on YouTube
[20:18.800 --> 20:22.540]  Go to YouTube search for embracing organics once we are done with the show
[20:22.540 --> 20:29.320]  It stays on YouTube so you can see all of the old repeat episodes simply go to YouTube search for embracing organics, bro
[20:29.320 --> 20:34.140]  I'm glad you're listening to embracing organics. I was actually on there tonight. We had a great time a great show
[20:34.140 --> 20:35.360]  Thank you for joining us there
[20:35.360 --> 20:40.520]  He goes on to say I heard about you guys on the dude grow show big shout out to all my friends at the dude
[20:40.520 --> 20:47.640]  Grows and I've been going deep down that rabbit hole ever since there are 100 episodes of embracing organics
[20:47.640 --> 20:50.880]  There are a thousand episodes of the dude grow show and there are
[20:52.040 --> 20:59.400]  521 episodes of the grow from your heart podcast. So you have got a nice little rabbit hole to dig down. Enjoy that my friend
[20:59.520 --> 21:01.120]  All right, we're getting toward the end here
[21:01.120 --> 21:07.360]  It goes on to say I'm looking forward to getting my hands on some lemon Jeffrey seeds after I recoup from this Herm
[21:07.880 --> 21:11.520]  Situation, would you recommend getting femme seeds being a med patient?
[21:11.520 --> 21:17.960]  I can only grow five plants above six inches tall so it is hard to Fino hunt much love from your buddy
[21:18.040 --> 21:21.480]  Riley Riley the answer to the lemon Jeffrey question is simple
[21:21.480 --> 21:23.920]  It is only available in feminized seeds
[21:23.920 --> 21:29.440]  So I do recommend lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds and the part where you say you can only
[21:29.720 --> 21:32.320]  Grow five at a time. So a Fino hunt is difficult
[21:32.360 --> 21:37.600]  Why not grow five see which one is your favorite out of those five cut down the other four?
[21:37.800 --> 21:42.640]  Plant four more seeds grow those four see which is your favorite out of all five of them
[21:42.760 --> 21:44.160]  Cut down the other four
[21:44.160 --> 21:48.120]  Repeat the process until you have got the Fino type that you were looking for
[21:48.120 --> 21:51.720]  You can go through as many seeds as you want. You can take as much time as you want
[21:51.720 --> 21:57.080]  This is not a race too many people are racing too many people are in a rush when it comes to cannabis
[21:57.120 --> 22:00.480]  Take your time one of the beautiful things about cannabis
[22:00.840 --> 22:04.560]  Especially growing it is that it makes you take your time when you smoke
[22:04.600 --> 22:12.120]  You're supposed to slow down and chill out growing cannabis is that feeling tenfold be in the garden be present
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.920]  Chill out. Enjoy yourself
[22:13.920 --> 22:15.760]  Let's not get in so much of a hurry
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.720]  But you can break up your Fino hunt by multiple rounds just to keep yourself within the numbers
[22:20.720 --> 22:26.360]  You can run five pick your favorite repeat the process and just keep picking your favorite one each time
[22:26.360 --> 22:31.440]  Maybe you pick the same one two or three times in a row and that's how you know, you're not gonna find a better keeper
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.800]  That's how you can make that decision. Now. Let's move back up to the part where you talk about
[22:36.560 --> 22:40.440]  Pollination and herms and how do I remove this pollen?
[22:40.440 --> 22:47.200]  There is one very easy thing you can do to get rid of pollen pollen is deactivated by water
[22:47.280 --> 22:52.080]  So spray down the room with water get yourself a pump sprayer. Just put water in there
[22:52.080 --> 22:57.720]  If you're going at it, why not put some bleach or maybe some fives and 20 or maybe put some h2o to or some zero
[22:57.720 --> 23:01.440]  Tall in there and just spray down everything the entire grow space
[23:01.600 --> 23:07.760]  Just mist it really lightly if you don't want to ruin any electronics if you're not gonna take down the gear just mist it enough
[23:07.760 --> 23:09.920]  Just to where everything has a nice little layer of water
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.680]  Maybe do it two or three times and you will get rid of all the pollen in there
[23:13.960 --> 23:20.800]  Definitely shop back all the corners sweep up real well anything you can reach hit it with the broom dust everything really nicely wipe it all
[23:20.800 --> 23:25.920]  Down but water is going to kill and deactivate any active pollen in that room
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.280]  So spray it down get it wet and the pollen will be unviable
[23:30.280 --> 23:37.200]  It will be basically dead now another important thing to think about is why did those plants herm was it genetics or was it?
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.840]  Environmental I don't think it was from the dryness
[23:39.840 --> 23:43.080]  I would assume more like I said earlier that it would be a light leak
[23:43.080 --> 23:46.020]  So let's make sure we don't have any light leaks in the room
[23:46.460 --> 23:50.820]  When you think the lights are out in the room go in that room
[23:51.020 --> 23:57.900]  Turn off the lights in the room and stand in there and give yourself five solid minutes for your eyes to adjust and see
[23:58.220 --> 24:04.940]  If there are any light leaks at all anywhere if you can see any light it is too much
[24:04.940 --> 24:09.060]  We need zero light if you can see your hand in front of your face
[24:09.060 --> 24:14.280]  We have more light than what we need for the plants to respond appropriately to a dark cycle
[24:14.480 --> 24:20.440]  Maybe you've got equipment in the room that is lighting up. Do you have a blue LED light on your mp3 player?
[24:20.440 --> 24:23.400]  Do you have a blue light on some clock or something in the room?
[24:23.400 --> 24:30.080]  Is there a red light on something the only acceptable light should be a green light and that is still questionable in some cases
[24:30.320 --> 24:34.880]  So let's make sure there are no light leaks in that room so that we don't have another
[24:34.960 --> 24:41.200]  Herm problem in the future and we end up sweeping up and cutting down plants and doing this whole panic move all over again
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.360]  So my short answer for a really long answer is water is what kills
[24:46.640 --> 24:52.640]  Pollen all you have to do is spray it down with water and those pollen grains hidden in the room will be destroyed
[24:52.720 --> 24:57.040]  Make sure you dust everything if you've got like some panda film on the floor
[24:57.040 --> 25:04.840]  Or if you've got a tray somewhere move that tray get underneath it flip those trays over spray the bottoms get everywhere because that pollen went
[25:04.840 --> 25:10.320]  In places you would never imagine it is very tiny microscopic dust flakes of pollen
[25:10.320 --> 25:15.160]  It's been blown around by the fan. It's underneath shit. It's on the bottom sides. It's in the corners
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.940]  It's everywhere. Make sure you sweep up get a shot back then spray everything down
[25:19.960 --> 25:22.240]  Maybe spray shit down a couple of times
[25:22.560 --> 25:28.320]  Now also keep in mind that the only plants that can receive pollen are the plants that are in flower and have pistols
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.440]  So you have got until you get more flowering plants in there to keep spraying
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.520]  So if you're going to apply a pesticide to that room if you put veg plants in there
[25:36.520 --> 25:37.840]  You're gonna hit them with a pesticide
[25:37.840 --> 25:41.960]  Just go crazy with the fucking pesticide and get the whole room wet all over again
[25:41.960 --> 25:47.040]  And that way you can be sure that you're actively destroying any pollen that may have been left behind
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.400]  Alright Riley. I want to thank you again for the great email. I do appreciate it
[25:51.400 --> 25:53.640]  You got me going on a good rant as well
