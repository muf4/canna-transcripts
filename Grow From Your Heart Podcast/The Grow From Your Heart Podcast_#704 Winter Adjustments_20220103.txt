[00:00.380 --> 00:18.700]  All right, here we go.
[00:18.700 --> 00:22.420]  Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and everything in between.
[00:22.420 --> 00:29.340]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 704 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:29.340 --> 00:33.500]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about adjusting our grow spaces for the winter.
[00:33.500 --> 00:37.620]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:37.620 --> 00:41.140]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:41.140 --> 00:46.260]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to RollMe1Kenobi.
[00:46.260 --> 00:48.620]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Grow Bandit.
[00:48.620 --> 00:52.380]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to our friends Fiskles Organics and Uncle
[00:52.380 --> 00:54.040]  Adam the Uber driver.
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.040]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Stash Drop 269 and Grow Man Stan.
[00:58.040 --> 01:00.720]  Let's send a fist bump to Kojax and Polo Paul.
[01:00.720 --> 01:03.560]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Shakoba and Turt Burglar.
[01:03.560 --> 01:05.700]  Let's send a big fist bump to Magic Mike.
[01:05.700 --> 01:09.320]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:09.420 --> 01:13.660]  to the hardest working man in cannabis, my friend James Brown.
[01:13.660 --> 01:18.460]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:18.460 --> 01:22.040]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:22.040 --> 01:28.160]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.400]  Of course, all of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:31.400 --> 01:35.220]  And I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make that
[01:35.220 --> 01:38.360]  nice and easy for all of our friends.
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.340]  I do want to take a brief moment to send a big shout out, a big some love, some energy
[01:43.340 --> 01:45.220]  to everybody in Boulder.
[01:45.220 --> 01:50.200]  If you've been watching the news, the Boulder area of Colorado has been experiencing suffering
[01:50.200 --> 01:52.140]  from some extreme fires.
[01:52.140 --> 01:56.060]  Many people have lost their homes, their properties, their businesses, their belongings.
[01:56.060 --> 01:57.780]  A lot of shit has burnt down.
[01:57.780 --> 01:59.700]  It is devastating to watch on the news.
[01:59.700 --> 02:05.620]  I know people personally who have lost homes, items, animals, a lot of shit went wrong up
[02:05.620 --> 02:06.620]  there.
[02:06.620 --> 02:11.020]  Lots of love and energy to all of the people in Boulder, that entire area suffering through
[02:11.020 --> 02:12.300]  those fires.
[02:12.300 --> 02:13.620]  That is terrible to watch.
[02:13.620 --> 02:16.980]  Their houses got burned down and then the next day we got a foot of snow.
[02:16.980 --> 02:19.460]  So they got their asses kicked up there.
[02:19.460 --> 02:20.460]  Lots of love to those folks.
[02:20.460 --> 02:22.700]  If you need some help, if you need anything, reach out.
[02:22.700 --> 02:25.940]  I'll do my best to help you out any way that I can.
[02:25.940 --> 02:26.940]  All right.
[02:26.940 --> 02:27.940]  Big shout out to everybody in Boulder.
[02:27.940 --> 02:31.140]  Big shout out to everybody going through some rough stuff at the start of the year.
[02:31.140 --> 02:32.180]  That's a struggle.
[02:32.180 --> 02:33.900]  Start the year with some problems.
[02:33.900 --> 02:34.900]  All right.
[02:34.900 --> 02:37.220]  So this is of course the first episode of the new year.
[02:37.220 --> 02:38.460]  Let's shift gears.
[02:38.460 --> 02:39.820]  Happy new year, everybody.
[02:39.820 --> 02:40.820]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:40.820 --> 02:42.700]  Let's kick off the new year strong.
[02:42.700 --> 02:46.900]  What can we do as growers, as breeders, as cannabis consumers to kick off the new year
[02:46.900 --> 02:47.900]  strong?
[02:47.900 --> 02:49.860]  We should start goals and journals.
[02:49.860 --> 02:50.860]  That's right.
[02:50.860 --> 02:53.440]  If you're growing, you should have a grow room journal.
[02:53.440 --> 02:56.500]  Inside of that journal, you should create some goals.
[02:56.500 --> 02:59.000]  What are you going to get better at this year?
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.540]  What did you fuck up last year in your grow that you didn't like the way you did that
[03:02.540 --> 03:04.300]  you know you could have done better?
[03:04.300 --> 03:06.220]  What are we going to improve on this year?
[03:06.220 --> 03:10.900]  Set some goals, set some ways to improve, set yourself up for success in this year.
[03:10.900 --> 03:14.740]  If you don't have any goals, if you don't have any objectives, any notes, how do you
[03:14.740 --> 03:15.740]  know if you're improving?
[03:15.740 --> 03:17.380]  How do you know what you did?
[03:17.380 --> 03:21.100]  Then in the second part of that journal, let's start taking a lot of notes so that when the
[03:21.100 --> 03:25.860]  grow comes out better or worse than last time, we know exactly what we did.
[03:25.860 --> 03:28.620]  So let's start off this new year by starting a journal.
[03:28.620 --> 03:31.500]  In that journal, let's set some goals and some objectives.
[03:31.860 --> 03:35.700]  When we're working in the grow room, let's write down everything we do.
[03:35.700 --> 03:39.740]  When you mix up a feed solution, write down how much water you started with.
[03:39.740 --> 03:40.980]  Sometimes it's a five-gallon container.
[03:40.980 --> 03:43.060]  A lot of people have a 10-gallon container.
[03:43.060 --> 03:45.420]  I rock a 30-gallon reservoir in one space.
[03:45.420 --> 03:47.780]  In another room, I've got a 250-gallon reservoir.
[03:47.780 --> 03:49.660]  Just depends on where I'm working.
[03:49.660 --> 03:53.500]  But write down the amount of water you started with and then write down everything that you
[03:53.500 --> 03:54.500]  put into it.
[03:54.500 --> 03:59.420]  If you mix up 100 milliliters of this nutrient and pour it into your 250-gallon res, write
[03:59.420 --> 04:00.420]  that down.
[04:00.420 --> 04:02.500]  I started with 250 gallons of water.
[04:02.500 --> 04:08.740]  I poured in 100 mils of this, 150 mils of this, this much of this nutrient, this many
[04:08.740 --> 04:09.740]  grams of this.
[04:09.740 --> 04:12.260]  Some of the stuff I feed is in a powdered form.
[04:12.260 --> 04:14.420]  Then I pH-ed it to this.
[04:14.420 --> 04:19.500]  After I put in the pH down or the pH up to get it to the 6.2 to 6.4 range I would approve
[04:19.500 --> 04:23.180]  of, then I checked the EC and I wrote down the EC also.
[04:23.180 --> 04:26.260]  So I know every nutrient that went in and exactly how much.
[04:26.260 --> 04:29.060]  I know what the EC of that total solution was at the end.
[04:29.060 --> 04:30.660]  I know what the pH was.
[04:30.660 --> 04:34.420]  Now when I feed those plants I can watch and if some shit goes wrong in a few days I've
[04:34.420 --> 04:35.420]  got a note.
[04:35.420 --> 04:39.900]  I can say, well, it's because we gave it 1,000 milliliters of this instead of 850.
[04:39.900 --> 04:44.400]  We know not to give it 850, not 1,000, just to stick it 850, maybe 900 next time.
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.580]  We pushed that bitch a little too hard.
[04:45.580 --> 04:47.180]  She got a little bit fried.
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.780]  That's the way that you can learn.
[04:48.780 --> 04:51.300]  We're cannabis consumers.
[04:51.300 --> 04:56.620]  Not only, most of us who are cannabis growers and breeders, we are heavy cannabis consumers.
[04:56.620 --> 04:57.700]  I really enjoy.
[04:57.700 --> 05:01.100]  There's nothing like taking a couple of fat dads or smoking a big fat joint on the way
[05:01.100 --> 05:04.060]  to the grow place, wherever you're going to grow.
[05:04.060 --> 05:05.940]  Maybe don't smoke in the car while you're driving.
[05:05.940 --> 05:07.500]  Smoke right when you get there.
[05:07.500 --> 05:08.900]  We just got to be safe with what we say.
[05:08.900 --> 05:10.940]  You know what I'm talking about.
[05:10.940 --> 05:11.940]  Don't smoke in the car.
[05:11.940 --> 05:12.940]  Don't smoke while you're driving.
[05:12.940 --> 05:16.460]  Follow all the legal laws, but smoke right before you go into the grow space if that's
[05:16.460 --> 05:17.460]  legal.
[05:17.460 --> 05:18.460]  It's like a zen feeling.
[05:18.460 --> 05:20.140]  I just like to get fucking stoned and go in there and work.
[05:20.140 --> 05:21.140]  I'm in the zone.
[05:21.140 --> 05:22.140]  I got the music going.
[05:22.140 --> 05:23.340]  I'm in my bubble, my element.
[05:23.340 --> 05:27.340]  That's where I feel super comfortable, on the stage behind some drums and in a grow room
[05:27.980 --> 05:31.260]  and obviously behind this microphone doing a podcast or some of my comfort zones.
[05:31.260 --> 05:33.220]  So I like to get a little blazed and go in there.
[05:33.220 --> 05:36.020]  Unfortunately, when you get blazed and go in there, you get in the zone.
[05:36.020 --> 05:41.660]  You just start doing shit like mix up nutrients, adjust the pH, test the EC, water the plants,
[05:41.660 --> 05:44.060]  catch some runoff, test the runoff sometimes.
[05:44.060 --> 05:46.140]  A lot of people do runoff reports.
[05:46.140 --> 05:49.620]  We're not going to delve into the runoff reports right now, but a lot of people will also test
[05:49.620 --> 05:51.500]  the runoff of the feed solution.
[05:51.500 --> 05:53.140]  The plants are going to have a little drainage.
[05:53.140 --> 05:54.340]  Gather that, test it.
[05:54.340 --> 05:56.020]  Check the EC and the pH of that.
[05:56.020 --> 05:57.220]  Document that.
[05:57.260 --> 06:00.660]  If you understand how to decipher that code later in the future, that may help you solve
[06:00.660 --> 06:02.020]  some problems.
[06:02.020 --> 06:05.420]  But you're going to be in there doing your routine and then you're just going to do stuff.
[06:05.420 --> 06:08.700]  You're going to get in the flow and then you're going to run into either great success or
[06:08.700 --> 06:12.860]  great problems in the future and you're not going to remember what you did to cause that
[06:12.860 --> 06:14.940]  success or that failure.
[06:14.940 --> 06:17.860]  If you would have just done a few things, taken a couple of notes, do a few things,
[06:17.860 --> 06:19.260]  take a couple of notes.
[06:19.260 --> 06:23.620]  The bigger the grow, the more notes I take, which I guess that's because it's a lot more
[06:23.620 --> 06:24.620]  of an investment.
[06:24.620 --> 06:28.500]  I'll just carry a clipboard around in a big grow and just write down what I did all day.
[06:28.500 --> 06:32.060]  If I've got a couple of guys doing work, I have them report to me at the end of the day
[06:32.060 --> 06:36.100]  and I fill out just a big report of everything that got done in every room.
[06:36.100 --> 06:40.940]  Try to compile all of the EC reports, the feed reports, all the ... what got defoliated,
[06:40.940 --> 06:42.380]  what got lollipopped and twisted.
[06:42.380 --> 06:47.300]  If there were any equipment issues that were noticed, if any bugs were noticed in the room,
[06:47.300 --> 06:49.940]  write down everything that you can in that grow space.
[06:49.940 --> 06:54.580]  That way, like I said, if you have good success or big failure, you can repeat those results.
[06:54.580 --> 06:58.420]  Then you can create what is known in the commercial industry as a standard operating
[06:58.420 --> 06:59.420]  procedure.
[06:59.420 --> 07:01.420]  You know that on day one, we do this.
[07:01.420 --> 07:02.660]  On day two, we do this.
[07:02.660 --> 07:06.300]  You can write a book and then every time you grow, you can follow your own instruction
[07:06.300 --> 07:08.460]  manual and you can nail that shit.
[07:08.460 --> 07:09.900]  Then you can learn how to improve.
[07:09.900 --> 07:13.780]  Until you've got some sort of standardized sample, you don't know that you've got evidence
[07:13.780 --> 07:14.780]  that you're proving.
[07:14.780 --> 07:16.740]  That's why we want to keep notes, see what we're doing.
[07:16.740 --> 07:18.100]  All right, I've been rambling.
[07:18.100 --> 07:20.620]  Let me check on my notes and see where we were.
[07:20.620 --> 07:23.220]  Write down everything that you spray.
[07:23.220 --> 07:27.940]  If you are spraying food, a pesticide, or a foliar application, whatever you're applying
[07:27.940 --> 07:30.020]  to the plants, write that down.
[07:30.020 --> 07:34.220]  In Colorado, we are required to write down any pesticide application.
[07:34.220 --> 07:39.740]  The pesticides have to be approved by the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the Colorado
[07:39.740 --> 07:41.300]  Department of Public Health and Environment.
[07:41.300 --> 07:43.140]  That's a lot of letters to remember.
[07:43.140 --> 07:45.700]  They have to be on an approved pesticide list.
[07:45.700 --> 07:50.260]  You have to write down the pesticide you applied, how much of it per gallon of water, how many
[07:50.260 --> 07:53.100]  gallons of that solution were mixed up and applied.
[07:53.180 --> 07:58.140]  The EPA number of the pesticide you used, the time you applied it, the plant numbers
[07:58.140 --> 07:59.620]  of which got applied.
[07:59.620 --> 08:02.660]  There are a lot of notes to be taken in a commercial environment.
[08:02.660 --> 08:05.940]  Why not just start doing that in your own personal grow?
[08:05.940 --> 08:09.780]  That way, there are a lot of advantages to writing down these pesticide applications.
[08:09.780 --> 08:12.780]  If something goes wrong in the future, you've got that paper trail.
[08:12.780 --> 08:13.780]  You know what you sprayed.
[08:13.780 --> 08:14.780]  You know what you applied.
[08:14.780 --> 08:16.940]  You know why you've got that weird rash on your arm.
[08:16.940 --> 08:20.540]  When you go to the doctor, you could say, five days ago, I applied this.
[08:20.540 --> 08:21.540]  Here's the bottle.
[08:21.540 --> 08:22.540]  Don't bring the bottle.
[08:22.980 --> 08:23.980]  Peel the label off.
[08:23.980 --> 08:26.340]  Take the label to the hospital with you when you go see the doctor.
[08:26.340 --> 08:27.340]  Show them what you used.
[08:27.340 --> 08:28.340]  Explain how it happened.
[08:28.340 --> 08:30.260]  Tell them you didn't use proper protective equipment.
[08:30.260 --> 08:32.780]  You got a little rash from it.
[08:32.780 --> 08:35.480]  Everything we do in a commercial grow has to be written down and marked.
[08:35.480 --> 08:38.780]  Get in the habit of doing that now because what if you end up working in a commercial
[08:38.780 --> 08:39.780]  grow?
[08:39.780 --> 08:40.780]  Why not make it a habit?
[08:40.780 --> 08:44.400]  Then you can tell when you go apply for the job, you can say, I'm already documenting
[08:44.400 --> 08:50.060]  pesticides to Department of Agriculture, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
[08:50.060 --> 08:51.060]  Standards.
[08:51.060 --> 08:52.500]  I'm already practicing that standard.
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.940]  I'm comfortable doing it in the commercial environment.
[08:55.940 --> 08:57.060]  Just set yourself up.
[08:57.060 --> 09:00.580]  If you want to work in a big grow, that'd be a good thing to do.
[09:00.580 --> 09:04.460]  I think I've rambled on for the first part of this podcast long enough.
[09:04.460 --> 09:05.460]  Start a journal, you guys.
[09:05.460 --> 09:08.220]  Let's set ourselves up for success in this new year.
[09:08.220 --> 09:09.580]  We got a brand new calendar year.
[09:09.580 --> 09:10.960]  You just turned the page.
[09:10.960 --> 09:14.300]  How many harvests are you going to pull off this calendar year?
[09:14.300 --> 09:15.460]  Can you get six harvests?
[09:15.460 --> 09:17.480]  Can you get 5.5 harvests?
[09:17.480 --> 09:18.820]  Can you stagger them out?
[09:18.820 --> 09:19.820]  What is your goal?
[09:19.820 --> 09:20.820]  Do you just want four harvests?
[09:20.820 --> 09:22.260]  Do you have enough rooms to get six harvests?
[09:23.020 --> 09:24.020]  That's another issue.
[09:24.020 --> 09:25.020]  What is your goal?
[09:25.020 --> 09:26.220]  What are you going to improve on?
[09:26.220 --> 09:27.740]  What did you really suck at before?
[09:27.740 --> 09:30.360]  What are you not happy with?
[09:30.360 --> 09:32.020]  Many people, their clone game sucks.
[09:32.020 --> 09:35.460]  Many people aren't exactly sure how to sex a plant.
[09:35.460 --> 09:38.740]  Many people are afraid to pop seeds because they don't know how to tell the difference
[09:38.740 --> 09:40.500]  between a male and a female.
[09:40.500 --> 09:41.500]  Let's jump in.
[09:41.500 --> 09:43.340]  If you're afraid of that, I'm here to help you out.
[09:43.340 --> 09:45.640]  We've got a lot of resources that will help you out.
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.220]  My Discord server, my website, me personally, the podcast, the Iry Army.
[09:50.220 --> 09:53.460]  We will definitely help you identify your males and your females.
[09:53.460 --> 09:54.460]  Pop some seeds.
[09:54.460 --> 09:56.060]  Maybe that's a new goal for the year.
[09:56.060 --> 09:57.060]  Start from seed.
[09:57.060 --> 09:58.380]  Let's just have a goal.
[09:58.380 --> 09:59.380]  Expand or grow.
[09:59.380 --> 10:01.900]  You're not going to get any better if you keep doing the same thing.
[10:01.900 --> 10:02.900]  Maybe you're cool.
[10:02.900 --> 10:06.380]  Maybe you're satisfied with your growth, but don't you want a little bit more for your
[10:06.380 --> 10:07.380]  money?
[10:07.380 --> 10:10.160]  Maybe you can just learn how to save a little bit of electricity and still put out the same
[10:10.160 --> 10:11.480]  amount of product.
[10:11.480 --> 10:14.620]  Maybe we can save you a few bucks somewhere and that will help you out.
[10:14.620 --> 10:18.500]  Even if your product is as good as you think it can be, maybe we can save money on lights,
[10:18.500 --> 10:21.300]  air, water, soil, maybe a little bit of labor.
[10:21.300 --> 10:23.300]  There's going to be a way that we can improve you this year.
[10:23.300 --> 10:24.500]  All right, I've been rambling.
[10:24.500 --> 10:25.500]  Set some goals.
[10:25.500 --> 10:26.500]  Write down some details.
[10:26.500 --> 10:29.380]  Write down what you feed, what you mix, what you did.
[10:29.380 --> 10:30.740]  Have a schedule.
[10:30.740 --> 10:33.520]  Write down a schedule and a plan and a goal.
[10:33.520 --> 10:34.920]  Get some sort of a flow.
[10:34.920 --> 10:36.900]  How long do your clones live in the clone machine?
[10:36.900 --> 10:39.520]  How long do your seedlings stay in that small section?
[10:39.520 --> 10:42.100]  When do you put them into smaller pots and have small veg?
[10:42.100 --> 10:44.280]  How long do they go into the bigger veg?
[10:44.280 --> 10:45.420]  How long do you veg those plants?
[10:45.420 --> 10:47.220]  Then when do you put them into flour?
[10:47.220 --> 10:49.660]  When they go into flour, how often do you defoliate?
[10:49.660 --> 10:50.660]  When do you lollipop?
[10:50.660 --> 10:51.660]  When do you pop and twist?
[10:51.660 --> 10:55.900]  When do you start adding your bloom boosters based on your specific feed schedule?
[10:55.900 --> 10:56.900]  Have a plan.
[10:56.900 --> 11:00.460]  Let's set some goals and routines based on this new schedule we've got for a brand new
[11:00.460 --> 11:01.460]  year.
[11:01.460 --> 11:02.460]  Let's set ourselves up for success.
[11:02.460 --> 11:03.460]  You guys write everything down.
[11:03.460 --> 11:05.820]  All right, I've been rambling about that part for long enough.
[11:05.820 --> 11:11.080]  I want to segue into the second half of this podcast, if you will.
[11:11.080 --> 11:12.940]  It finally snowed.
[11:12.940 --> 11:15.120]  That may not be a big deal to you.
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.120]  Here in Colorado, we've been getting very worried about drought-like conditions because
[11:19.120 --> 11:20.640]  we're not getting any snow.
[11:20.640 --> 11:22.720]  We're into January.
[11:22.720 --> 11:24.680]  I always say that we get snow on Halloween.
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.560]  I make a big joke that we arrange our Halloween costume in Colorado around the weather because
[11:29.560 --> 11:30.960]  it always snows on Halloween.
[11:30.960 --> 11:34.560]  You see people out there, the girls in their Tinkerbell costumes and the guys in their
[11:34.560 --> 11:37.160]  whatever costumes, I don't even know what dudes wear anymore.
[11:37.160 --> 11:40.400]  They're out there in their costumes, little tiny, just little Walmart outfits because
[11:40.400 --> 11:41.680]  you don't buy expensive shit for Halloween.
[11:41.680 --> 11:43.440]  They're just freezing their nuts off.
[11:43.480 --> 11:47.920]  I always joke that you got to set your costume up around a jacket or some long sleeves.
[11:47.920 --> 11:48.920]  That's why I was always Chewbacca.
[11:48.920 --> 11:51.000]  You get that long, just a big fur suit.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.200]  I don't even wear anything under it and I'm nice and warm all night.
[11:54.200 --> 11:56.480]  Sorry, I gave you that detail.
[11:56.480 --> 11:58.400]  Anyway, we didn't get any snow.
[11:58.400 --> 12:00.400]  It's been too many months without some snow.
[12:00.400 --> 12:03.680]  I sound like an old guy talking about that, but that brings drought-like conditions so
[12:03.680 --> 12:08.400]  we don't get any water for the summer, which leads to forest fires, which leads to shit
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.800]  like what is happening in the Boulder Superior area right now, which is devastating.
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.400]  If the weather would have been a little bit more moist, a little bit more snow, a little
[12:16.400 --> 12:19.040]  rain, we may not have had such devastating fires.
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.640]  All right, I sound like an old guy.
[12:20.640 --> 12:22.640]  I sound like a two old guy sitting on the porch.
[12:22.640 --> 12:24.960]  We don't get no water soon, but that's really how it is.
[12:24.960 --> 12:28.640]  But we finally got some snow and when it snowed, boy did it snow.
[12:28.640 --> 12:29.760]  It is deep out there.
[12:29.760 --> 12:36.240]  I drive a Ford SUV and the snow is up to about at least halfway, a little bit past halfway
[12:36.240 --> 12:38.320]  from my tires, which is a lot of snow for my area.
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.760]  I live in the city here.
[12:39.760 --> 12:41.520]  I usually don't get that much.
[12:41.520 --> 12:42.520]  So it dumped on us.
[12:42.520 --> 12:44.200]  Nature is confused.
[12:44.200 --> 12:45.800]  My point is, you guys, it is cold now.
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.440]  It just suddenly went from really nice to super duper cold here.
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.520]  If you are in Colorado, if you are in North America, now is the time, if you have not
[12:54.520 --> 13:00.840]  already, now is the time to jump our grow rooms into winter conditions, winter preparations.
[13:00.840 --> 13:02.200]  I don't know your grow space.
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.720]  I don't know your grow environment.
[13:03.720 --> 13:05.640]  I don't know where you're growing at all.
[13:05.640 --> 13:09.640]  But if it gets cold outside, now is a good time to make some adjustments.
[13:09.640 --> 13:10.920]  We can learn a few things.
[13:10.920 --> 13:12.360]  We can save some electricity.
[13:12.360 --> 13:14.360]  We can move heat around to the right places.
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.280]  May not have to duct as many things.
[13:16.280 --> 13:20.200]  Let's talk about a few things to adjust now that it is winter time.
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.160]  Because being growers, being indoor growers, this is mostly going to apply to the indoor
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.840]  growers, we do have to learn to adjust and adapt.
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.840]  We can't expect the exact same things that worked in the summer to work for us in the
[13:32.840 --> 13:33.160]  winter.
[13:33.160 --> 13:37.800]  We may need to make some gear changes, some room changes, just some basic adjustments
[13:37.800 --> 13:41.000]  just to maximize potential for our garden.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.360]  We want our plants to still do the best in the winter as they do in the summer.
[13:44.360 --> 13:50.520]  Honestly, my fall crop, when I grow indoors, my personal grow, my crop around Halloween
[13:50.520 --> 13:53.080]  is always the best because it's not super hot.
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.280]  It gets hot here in the summer.
[13:54.280 --> 13:55.640]  I'm in southern Colorado.
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.120]  We'll have 102, 110 days.
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.200]  It gets negative 17 in the winter.
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.720]  So that fall crop, when it's actually tolerable conditions for plants and humans and you don't
[14:05.720 --> 14:10.040]  have to fight the sun and the snow in your grow space, those crops are always the finest,
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.120]  in my opinion, for me, those are the most successful.
[14:13.320 --> 14:16.360]  But we've got to learn to adjust and adapt due to seasons.
[14:16.360 --> 14:21.400]  Now let's talk about a couple of adjustments that I make automatically when the winter
[14:21.400 --> 14:22.120]  comes.
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.080]  I usually run in the summer, springtime, the warmer part of the year, I run LED lighting.
[14:27.080 --> 14:29.880]  You guys know that I recently fell in love with the LED lighting.
[14:29.880 --> 14:34.040]  I've been running the Canon LEDs from Black Sale, big up to our friends at Black Sale
[14:34.040 --> 14:37.720]  Market, ARG, whatever else their slogans are these days.
[14:37.720 --> 14:40.200]  Keep up with our friends at Black Sale Market, give them a follow.
[14:40.200 --> 14:41.960]  Good lightings, good lighting.
[14:41.960 --> 14:43.000]  I've been using the Canons.
[14:43.000 --> 14:43.480]  I love them.
[14:43.480 --> 14:47.560]  They make my plants bushy and dense and they do all the things I need them to do.
[14:47.560 --> 14:50.840]  Now that I've learned them, it was a learning curve figuring out how to use the things.
[14:50.840 --> 14:57.320]  But in the winter, those lights do not provide enough heat to keep my grow space warm.
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.280]  So to keep that room warm, I simply replace the LED lighting with HPS lights.
[15:02.280 --> 15:08.360]  I put up, I take down a few LEDs and I put up three HPS lights and those keep that small
[15:08.360 --> 15:10.440]  space warm very efficiently.
[15:10.440 --> 15:12.360]  I don't have to duck the air out too much.
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.600]  I do run a duct out to get the humidity out, but I don't run it as often as I used to during
[15:16.600 --> 15:17.160]  the summer.
[15:17.800 --> 15:20.280]  So I switch those lights out to create some heat.
[15:20.280 --> 15:22.680]  I don't want the cool LEDs in the winter.
[15:22.680 --> 15:25.800]  I actually want the hot HPS lights in the winter.
[15:25.800 --> 15:27.560]  Now, here's another thing that I do.
[15:27.560 --> 15:30.920]  I put those lights on a different schedule.
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.680]  I will run the HPS lights during the night time.
[15:34.680 --> 15:41.160]  So instead of having the lights on from 9am to 9pm, now I will run the HPS lights from 9pm
[15:41.160 --> 15:42.600]  till 9am.
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.080]  I do make sure to carefully adjust my light cycle if I've got plants in flower, but I'm
[15:47.080 --> 15:48.040]  experienced in doing that.
[15:48.040 --> 15:50.600]  And I've also done a full podcast on how to do it.
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.840]  Just be careful if you're adjusting plants that are in flower.
[15:52.840 --> 15:54.760]  Don't just, don't give them a long day.
[15:54.760 --> 15:57.560]  Give them an extended night to get back on schedule is the tip there.
[15:57.560 --> 16:02.520]  But I will run the lights during the night because it gets colder at night.
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.720]  It gets colder at night.
[16:03.720 --> 16:05.480]  Naturally, the sun goes down, it's colder.
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.240]  I use my grow lights to keep the space warmer.
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.600]  During the day, the heater's on, the sun is up, that grow space will stay ambiently warm.
[16:14.600 --> 16:17.880]  It stays the same temperature as the rest of the building, the rest of the house, which
[16:17.880 --> 16:20.200]  is ambient temperature because there's central heating.
[16:20.200 --> 16:23.160]  So the place stays warm during the normal part of the day.
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.760]  But when it gets cold outside, that sun drops, everything gets colder.
[16:26.760 --> 16:30.760]  And so to keep it a little bit warmer in there, the lights do come on during the night
[16:30.760 --> 16:32.920]  cycle, during the night time.
[16:32.920 --> 16:33.800]  It's not the night cycle.
[16:33.800 --> 16:34.920]  It is the night time for us.
[16:34.920 --> 16:36.760]  When I would be asleep, the lights are on.
[16:36.760 --> 16:38.280]  It works out that way for me very well.
[16:38.280 --> 16:39.160]  Some people can't do that.
[16:39.160 --> 16:40.120]  I understand that.
[16:40.120 --> 16:42.360]  That is one quick adjustment that I do make.
[16:42.360 --> 16:47.240]  Another thing that I think about is moving and ducting my hot air.
[16:47.240 --> 16:49.560]  Those warm lights are creating hot air.
[16:49.560 --> 16:52.600]  I've got a bedroom, which is also filled with warm air.
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.240]  I used to duct that air out of the grow area.
[16:55.240 --> 16:58.360]  It used to go outside so that it would just get away from the grow.
[16:58.360 --> 17:01.080]  Now that it's warm, I utilize that heat.
[17:01.080 --> 17:04.760]  Maybe sometimes I'll dump some of that heat into a bedroom and just warm up the house
[17:04.760 --> 17:05.320]  with it.
[17:05.320 --> 17:09.160]  If the rooms are right and conditions work out, sometimes I'll dump the heat from the
[17:09.160 --> 17:13.400]  bedroom into the flower room during the night time so that that flowering room will get
[17:13.400 --> 17:18.120]  some heat during its dark cycle and not get too cold while the lights are off.
[17:18.120 --> 17:22.440]  These are all small adjustments that you can learn to custom tailor for your grow space.
[17:22.440 --> 17:24.040]  What do you need to do?
[17:24.040 --> 17:25.320]  Where are you getting too much heat?
[17:25.320 --> 17:27.160]  Where would you like that heat to go?
[17:27.160 --> 17:28.200]  Where is it too cold?
[17:28.200 --> 17:29.880]  Where would you like that cool to go?
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.760]  Learn to manipulate and move that air around and save yourself on electricity and ducting.
[17:34.760 --> 17:37.160]  Make your grow room as sufficient as you can make it.
[17:37.160 --> 17:39.240]  The winter time is a good time to learn that.
[17:39.240 --> 17:42.360]  It's a completely different struggle than during the summer.
[17:42.360 --> 17:45.800]  So learn to move the air around instead of dumping it outdoors.
[17:45.800 --> 17:47.480]  Don't waste that hot air in the winter.
[17:47.480 --> 17:48.680]  You heated up that air.
[17:48.680 --> 17:50.040]  Let's put it somewhere useful.
[17:50.040 --> 17:52.760]  If nothing else, dump it into the house and keep the house warm.
[17:52.760 --> 17:55.560]  You've already paid for the electricity to warm that air up.
[17:55.560 --> 18:00.600]  Let's keep that heat in the house, in somewhere in the facility to at least warm up a grow room.
[18:00.600 --> 18:01.880]  Maybe warm up a bedroom.
[18:01.880 --> 18:02.920]  Warm up something.
[18:02.920 --> 18:03.640]  That is my point.
[18:03.640 --> 18:05.240]  Don't waste that hot air.
[18:05.240 --> 18:06.520]  Now let's think about something else.
[18:06.520 --> 18:12.360]  If you are dumping that hot air out somewhere, are you melting the snow in a weird section
[18:12.360 --> 18:15.320]  to where your whole neighborhood knows that that is a grow?
[18:15.320 --> 18:16.920]  Think about where the heat is going.
[18:16.920 --> 18:20.680]  We've all seen that photo from Canada where the guy's got the apartment building and his
[18:20.680 --> 18:24.840]  apartment is the only one with the snow melting off of it and they busted him for growing
[18:24.840 --> 18:25.720]  weed in there.
[18:25.720 --> 18:27.240]  Are you doing that in the winter?
[18:27.240 --> 18:28.840]  Are you snitching on yourself?
[18:28.840 --> 18:31.720]  Is your blower melting snow in an awkward place?
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.040]  Is your roof, the only roof, that attic space, the only space in the neighborhood without
[18:36.040 --> 18:39.240]  a bunch of snow on it because your grow is up there melting that snow?
[18:39.240 --> 18:42.840]  Think about how you're going to bust yourself here in the winter because the snow could
[18:42.840 --> 18:43.960]  give you away.
[18:43.960 --> 18:46.040]  Beware of the evidence is what I wrote.
[18:46.040 --> 18:46.360]  All right.
[18:46.360 --> 18:52.120]  Another thing I want to talk about is warming up our water, which we use to water our plants.
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.280]  In one of the commercial grows that I used to run, the water would come from a well basically
[18:56.280 --> 18:57.960]  outside into the building.
[18:57.960 --> 19:00.760]  In the winter, that water would be extremely cold.
[19:00.760 --> 19:04.040]  We would have to put heaters in the reservoirs to warm up the water.
[19:04.040 --> 19:05.880]  I don't know where your water comes from.
[19:05.880 --> 19:09.480]  If the water is coming from outside in the winter, the pipes are outside.
[19:09.480 --> 19:10.920]  It's got to come from somewhere.
[19:10.920 --> 19:15.000]  If it's coming into your home, into your commercial facility, it's probably really cold.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.400]  My advice, fill up your reservoirs, whatever you're holding water in, fill those up the
[19:19.400 --> 19:20.040]  night before.
[19:20.680 --> 19:24.360]  In a lot of the commercial grows where I work, we will just get trash cans on wheels, a big
[19:24.360 --> 19:28.680]  Rubbermaid or a Brute trash can, a 50-gallon trash can on wheels.
[19:28.680 --> 19:30.280]  We'll fill those up with water.
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.840]  Then we will move those into the veg room under the veg lights to stay there overnight.
[19:34.840 --> 19:36.920]  When you come back, they have reached room temperature.
[19:36.920 --> 19:38.360]  They're safe to use.
[19:38.360 --> 19:41.480]  Don't water your plants with extremely cold water.
[19:41.480 --> 19:46.680]  I wouldn't go less than 70 degrees, maybe 68 at the very lowest, but you don't want
[19:46.680 --> 19:48.600]  cold water watering your plants.
[19:48.600 --> 19:52.920]  Just think about putting your toes, your balls, your hands in some cold water.
[19:52.920 --> 19:53.880]  It's going to piss you off.
[19:53.880 --> 19:55.720]  It's not going to make you want to drink or eat.
[19:55.720 --> 19:56.760]  It's just going to make you angry.
[19:56.760 --> 19:58.680]  That will do the same thing to the plants.
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.800]  Let's not piss them off.
[20:00.440 --> 20:02.360]  Just get that water nice and warm.
[20:02.360 --> 20:04.280]  The plants will thank you for that.
[20:04.280 --> 20:07.880]  Also, another thing we could do is get the plants up off of the ground.
[20:07.880 --> 20:11.800]  If the grow room is cold, if you're growing in the basement or a commercial facility with
[20:11.800 --> 20:14.920]  a concrete floor, let's not have the plants on the floor.
[20:14.920 --> 20:16.760]  That floor is very cold.
[20:16.760 --> 20:20.760]  If you aren't comfortable walking around on that floor barefoot, the plants are not comfortable
[20:20.760 --> 20:21.720]  there either.
[20:21.720 --> 20:24.520]  We're going to put that water or that plant on the cold floor.
[20:24.520 --> 20:27.560]  Then we're going to pour water into it, and that cold floor is going to make that water
[20:27.560 --> 20:28.440]  really cold.
[20:28.440 --> 20:29.240]  The roots are in there.
[20:29.240 --> 20:30.440]  They're not going to feed properly.
[20:30.440 --> 20:32.520]  Your pH is going to get all out of whack.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.880]  Things are going to go really wrong.
[20:34.520 --> 20:37.480]  If you can, get those plants up off of the floor.
[20:37.480 --> 20:38.600]  Raise them up off the floor.
[20:38.600 --> 20:39.400]  It doesn't take a lot.
[20:39.400 --> 20:42.360]  You could get another pot, whatever size pot you're using.
[20:42.360 --> 20:43.080]  Buy another one.
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.280]  Flip it upside down.
[20:44.280 --> 20:46.280]  It'll raise your plant up a couple of inches.
[20:46.280 --> 20:47.560]  Set the plant right on top of that.
[20:47.560 --> 20:48.360]  It is off the floor.
[20:48.360 --> 20:49.640]  You could use pallets.
[20:49.640 --> 20:51.080]  I don't like pallets because I kick them.
[20:51.080 --> 20:51.720]  I trip on them.
[20:52.280 --> 20:52.840]  And they're wood.
[20:52.840 --> 20:54.200]  I don't like adding that wood into the grow.
[20:54.200 --> 20:57.240]  But if that's what you've got to do, that's what you've got to do.
[20:57.240 --> 21:03.160]  I would prefer you get a table with a hydro tray in there and put the plants in that and
[21:03.160 --> 21:06.120]  put a drain so they could drain into something underneath and you could pull out the drain and
[21:06.120 --> 21:07.160]  get rid of the water.
[21:07.160 --> 21:09.080]  That's spending some money that's going in on it.
[21:09.080 --> 21:13.160]  But get those plants up off the ground for the winter because, like I said, if you can't
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.840]  put your bare feet on that floor and walk around, and some of you motherfuckers got
[21:16.840 --> 21:20.440]  those Chewbacca feet, you can't feel anything, you've been at the festival for your whole
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.800]  life, you do not count.
[21:21.800 --> 21:23.560]  Get those plants up off the ground.
[21:23.560 --> 21:25.320]  Set yourself up for success.
[21:25.320 --> 21:29.800]  Maximum root growth, maximum potential if the roots are nice and happy.
[21:29.800 --> 21:32.760]  All right, podcast world, it looks like I've covered all of my notes.
[21:32.920 --> 21:34.440]  I think I'm going to wrap up this podcast.
[21:34.440 --> 21:36.200]  I want to thank you once again for listening.
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.320]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know that I would love to
[21:39.320 --> 21:39.960]  hear from you.
[21:39.960 --> 21:43.320]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:43.320 --> 21:44.200]  Don't be shy.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.080]  Send me your feedback.
[21:45.080 --> 21:46.920]  Send me your constructive criticism.
[21:46.920 --> 21:48.360]  Wish me a happy new year.
[21:48.360 --> 21:51.160]  Whatever you've got to say, I look forward to hearing from you.
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.120]  One of my new year's resolutions, once again, is to be better at answering my emails.
[21:56.120 --> 21:58.680]  I really try to answer all of the emails that come in.
[21:58.680 --> 22:02.360]  I've got Patreon messages, Discord messages, multiple email accounts.
[22:02.520 --> 22:04.840]  I'm not making excuses, but it is just me.
[22:04.840 --> 22:09.400]  I'm the only one answering all of those emails, doing these shows, living a life, building
[22:09.400 --> 22:10.360]  a dream.
[22:10.360 --> 22:11.240]  It's just me.
[22:11.240 --> 22:14.760]  One of my resolutions, however, is to get better at answering those emails and answer
[22:14.760 --> 22:15.400]  more of them.
[22:15.400 --> 22:16.920]  But when I answer them, you guys reply.
[22:16.920 --> 22:18.680]  So I just got to answer that again, and then you reply.
[22:18.680 --> 22:20.760]  And then it's like it's, I'm just kidding.
[22:20.760 --> 22:21.400]  But we'll catch up.
[22:21.400 --> 22:23.160]  We'll get more emails answered.

[22:55.320 --> 22:56.040]  podcast.
[22:56.040 --> 22:58.520]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[22:58.520 --> 23:01.720]  Let's give a big shout out to my friend Tree Star Meadow.
[23:01.720 --> 23:08.360]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
