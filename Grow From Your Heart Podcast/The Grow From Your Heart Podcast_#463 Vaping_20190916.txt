[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Take three.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:02.000 --> 00:05.920]  It is time for episode 463 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.920 --> 00:09.640]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.640 --> 00:14.240]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:14.240 --> 00:21.960]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.960 --> 00:25.520]  You know we like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.520 --> 00:30.760]  Today I've been taking dabs of Downshift Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.760 --> 00:35.440]  This is a blend of Southbound and HSB, which is the Han Solo Burger.
[00:35.440 --> 00:37.800]  On the package, they describe the flavor as gath.
[00:37.800 --> 00:38.800]  Gath?
[00:38.800 --> 00:39.800]  Did I just say gath?
[00:39.800 --> 00:40.800]  All right.
[00:40.800 --> 00:41.800]  This is the Mike Tyson podcast.
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.240]  Welcome to Hot Boxing with Mike.
[00:43.240 --> 00:46.720]  This flavor is described as gath, earth, and hazelnut.
[00:46.720 --> 00:48.880]  It really says gas, earth, and hazelnut.
[00:48.880 --> 00:53.400]  I absolutely taste the gas, the earth, but the hazelnut eludes me.
[00:53.400 --> 00:55.760]  I do not catch the hazelnut flavor.
[00:55.760 --> 00:57.080]  Most of the time I agree.
[00:57.080 --> 00:58.760]  This time, that one is missing me.
[00:58.760 --> 00:59.920]  No offense, not a big deal.
[00:59.920 --> 01:02.560]  It is a fucking tremendous and delicious concentrate.
[01:02.560 --> 01:10.320]  The potency label says this product contains 67.99% THC and zero CBD.
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.840]  I really enjoy the flavor and aromas, but mostly I enjoy the excellent high from the
[01:15.840 --> 01:18.000]  Downshift Live Batter.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.440]  Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for always keeping me laced up with the delicious
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.720]  and tremendous Top Shelf concentrates.
[01:25.720 --> 01:29.560]  All right, ladies and jelly spoons, in this episode I am going to talk about a subject
[01:29.560 --> 01:32.880]  that Mike and I were discussing on a recent car ride.
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.480]  Before we get there, I would like to give a shout out to some of my friends from Patreon.
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.480]  Let's start off with a big thank you shout out to my friend, Miss Mel.
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.120]  Let's also send a big thank you shout out to my buddy, Richard M. I want to send a giant
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.580]  thank you and a Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to our buddy, Tyler.
[01:47.580 --> 01:49.920]  Also a big thank you shout out to Justin.

[01:53.960 --> 01:56.000]  Of course, a giant thank you to Sam.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.560]  Of course, we can't miss our buddy, Tanner M.
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.400]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a giant thank you shout out to our buddy,
[02:02.400 --> 02:04.080]  Squirrel Tactics.
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.840]  Big thanks to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[02:16.820 --> 02:21.140]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:21.140 --> 02:22.620]  All right, podcast world.
[02:22.620 --> 02:27.660]  I said that I was going to bring up a conversation that Mike and I had on a long, adventurous
[02:27.660 --> 02:29.380]  car ride yesterday.
[02:29.380 --> 02:30.380]  Big shout out to Mike.
[02:30.380 --> 02:33.100]  I had to go, I got to go to, where did I go?
[02:33.100 --> 02:34.100]  Where is that place?
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.100]  Frisco.
[02:35.100 --> 02:36.540]  I got to go to Frisco, Colorado yesterday.
[02:36.540 --> 02:39.660]  That was about a three and a half hour drive each direction.
[02:39.660 --> 02:42.880]  There was a little bit of a traffic jam and some construction one way, so it turned into
[02:42.880 --> 02:45.180]  a four and a half hour drive one way.
[02:45.180 --> 02:47.460]  About three and a half hours on the way back.
[02:47.460 --> 02:51.340]  Cannot complain at all because Mike was a great co-pilot and a great passenger.
[02:51.340 --> 02:52.700]  So big shout out to Mike.
[02:52.700 --> 02:56.100]  I asked Mike, I said, hey bro, I'm going to go up to this place and I want to go buy some
[02:56.100 --> 02:57.100]  new drums.
[02:57.100 --> 02:58.100]  You guys, I am a drummer.
[02:58.100 --> 03:00.940]  I picked up a new DW Collector Series drum kit.
[03:00.940 --> 03:03.580]  We won't talk too much about that, but I said, Mike, I'm going to go buy these drums.
[03:03.580 --> 03:05.360]  It'd be cool to have a passenger.
[03:05.360 --> 03:08.260]  And without any hesitation, he said, what time do I need to be there?
[03:08.260 --> 03:09.500]  So Mike came with me.
[03:09.500 --> 03:10.860]  We went for a ride.
[03:11.180 --> 03:15.380]  Now, anytime you put Mike and I in a car together, there will be great conversation.
[03:15.380 --> 03:19.100]  After being in the car on a nice country ride for about an hour yesterday, I decided that
[03:19.100 --> 03:25.300]  it was time, maybe possibly, allegedly, to pull out my Green Dot Labs dab pan.
[03:25.300 --> 03:26.780]  So I busted out my Green Dot pan.
[03:26.780 --> 03:28.940]  I hit the button five times to turn it on.
[03:28.940 --> 03:29.940]  It flickered at me.
[03:29.940 --> 03:38.760]  I held down the little button and I put it in my mouth just like this.
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.440]  And allegedly, I took a nice little dab on a back country road on a beautiful day.
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.880]  That started a lot of great conversations between Mike and I.
[03:47.880 --> 03:50.320]  First off, Mike was like, are you dabbing while you're driving, buddy?
[03:50.320 --> 03:52.560]  And I said, maybe allegedly, but possibly not.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.420]  So who knows what happened there?
[03:54.420 --> 03:58.840]  Then the conversation that followed was, what do you feel about the controversy around those
[03:58.840 --> 03:59.840]  pens?
[03:59.840 --> 04:02.960]  Mike was a little bit surprised to see me hitting a pen.
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.600]  So let's talk about all of this controversy and shit that is swirling around dab pens
[04:08.600 --> 04:09.600]  and vape pens.
[04:09.600 --> 04:11.200]  There is a lot of stuff to talk about.
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.200]  I feel like it is partly my responsibility to address this topic.
[04:15.200 --> 04:19.720]  I did invite Mike to come back, but he spent all of his playtime yesterday going on an
[04:19.720 --> 04:20.760]  adventure with me.
[04:20.760 --> 04:23.620]  So today he is being a good husband and a good father.
[04:23.620 --> 04:28.640]  So today I am here by myself trying to recreate the conversation and remember the main bullet
[04:28.640 --> 04:31.440]  points from our conversation yesterday.
[04:31.440 --> 04:32.880]  So let's talk a little bit about it.
[04:32.880 --> 04:37.760]  Recently in the news, we have heard a lot of controversy, a lot of cries of fear, and
[04:37.760 --> 04:40.880]  a lot of warnings surrounding vaping.
[04:40.880 --> 04:45.320]  At the time of this recording, multiple people have died from vaping.
[04:45.320 --> 04:50.640]  At the time of this recording, multiple people are hospitalized from vaping.
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.600]  Vaping has caused mass hysteria on social media and through the media, and basically
[04:55.600 --> 04:58.800]  it is the new scare in America this week.
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.480]  So Mike was quite surprised to see me just sucking on this Green Dot Vape Cart pen like
[05:03.480 --> 05:07.160]  it was a pacifier, and I was enjoying it with no fear.
[05:07.160 --> 05:08.880]  So Mike and I had a great conversation.
[05:08.880 --> 05:12.880]  There are several things to think about when it comes to vaping.
[05:12.880 --> 05:17.200]  One of the first questions I have when it comes to vaping is, was the person injured
[05:17.200 --> 05:23.760]  consuming a cannabis vape, a cannabis concentrate vape, or were they using a nicotine vape?
[05:23.760 --> 05:28.160]  All three of these things are going to have different outcomes and different risks.
[05:28.160 --> 05:33.840]  I am going to start by talking about nicotine, vapes, and e-juice, because honestly, that
[05:33.840 --> 05:39.120]  is where I have the least amount of knowledge and the least amount of education.
[05:39.120 --> 05:43.960]  And this is not a nicotine podcast, so we will cover this portion very quickly.
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.840]  There are many obvious dangers behind vaping nicotine e-juice.
[05:48.840 --> 05:52.180]  First of all, there are many obvious dangers behind vaping anything.
[05:52.180 --> 05:57.400]  You are heating a material to a temperature where it volatizes to where you can inhale
[05:57.400 --> 06:01.360]  it as a vapor, and you are taking that product into your lungs.
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.360]  Think about that.
[06:02.360 --> 06:06.760]  No matter what you're vaping, there has got to be some sort of a health concern and a
[06:06.760 --> 06:07.760]  health risk.
[06:07.760 --> 06:08.760]  I'm not a doctor.
[06:08.760 --> 06:12.360]  I don't care what the doctors say, how they say it's healthier, it's safer.
[06:12.360 --> 06:13.920]  There is still some sort of risk.
[06:13.920 --> 06:17.760]  The only thing that is supposed to go into your lungs is clean air.
[06:17.760 --> 06:19.200]  There are other elements in that air.
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.920]  There's nitrogen, there's oxygen, there's carbon dioxide, a bunch of other things, but
[06:22.920 --> 06:26.600]  we don't need to add particulates and other things to that air.
[06:26.600 --> 06:29.280]  That is not what our lungs were designed for.
[06:29.280 --> 06:32.560]  Now I am a big, giant hypocrite because I take half gram dabs.
[06:32.560 --> 06:38.280]  I'm just saying we have to keep in mind that vaporizing anything has an associated health
[06:38.280 --> 06:40.000]  risk, and we have to keep that in mind.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.960]  But when we're vaping the nicotine or the nicotine-free e-juice, we have to keep in
[06:44.960 --> 06:48.240]  mind that we may not know where that came from.
[06:48.240 --> 06:53.880]  We have to keep in mind that the companies making these products are in business to turn
[06:53.880 --> 06:55.120]  a profit.
[06:55.120 --> 06:57.040]  They are not a health company.
[06:57.040 --> 06:58.820]  They are not a wellness company.
[06:58.860 --> 07:03.780]  They are a profiteering company, and most of the time, they are in another country that
[07:03.780 --> 07:08.580]  does not have production standards that we have here in the States.
[07:08.580 --> 07:13.420]  So who knows what you are vaping in those e-juice pens?
[07:13.420 --> 07:18.640]  There are multiple different products being used to cut the nicotine juice.
[07:18.640 --> 07:22.380]  Some of them have been proven to be safer than others, but we haven't been doing this
[07:22.380 --> 07:24.980]  long enough to have long-term testing.
[07:24.980 --> 07:29.820]  We don't know what's going to happen to people 20 years after vaping e-juice because nobody
[07:29.820 --> 07:32.380]  has been doing it that long yet.
[07:32.380 --> 07:37.420]  Now the second thing I think about when it comes to vaping anything is the machine, the
[07:37.420 --> 07:39.340]  device, the material.
[07:39.340 --> 07:45.660]  You are heating up something hot enough to create your material to vaporize.
[07:45.660 --> 07:46.940]  What else are you heating up?
[07:46.940 --> 07:51.500]  Are you heating up the plastic, the rubber, the polyurethane coating, the aluminum, the
[07:51.500 --> 07:54.300]  glass, the faux glass?
[07:54.300 --> 07:58.940]  If you are heating up your e-juice or your concentrate or your flour or anything to a
[07:58.940 --> 08:05.260]  temperature to achieve vaporization, you are probably possibly heating up other elements
[08:05.260 --> 08:09.540]  in your device that you are inhaling directly into your lungs.
[08:09.540 --> 08:15.220]  We may be consuming extra particles that we do not want, that we did not agree to, that
[08:15.220 --> 08:20.020]  we did not even know we were sucking in when we were sucking on these vape pens.
[08:20.100 --> 08:25.260]  When it comes to e-juice, whether it is nicotine-free or has nicotine, my main concern is what else
[08:25.260 --> 08:26.820]  is in that juice.
[08:26.820 --> 08:31.800]  It only has to be a little bit of nicotine for it to be passed as nicotine vape juice.
[08:31.800 --> 08:33.340]  What is the other stuff in there?
[08:33.340 --> 08:34.720]  Is that donkey piss?
[08:34.720 --> 08:36.540]  Is that propylene glycol?
[08:36.540 --> 08:39.820]  Is that just random leftover shit in the factory from something else?
[08:39.820 --> 08:43.620]  Is it a byproduct from something they're making in that factory?
[08:43.620 --> 08:48.740]  These countries and these manufacturers do not care about the consumer.
[08:48.740 --> 08:49.940]  Keep that in mind.
[08:49.980 --> 08:53.700]  They want to make a product, they want to put it in a bottle, and they're sending it
[08:53.700 --> 09:00.580]  on a boat to another country for us to consume, and they don't have any consequences or any
[09:00.580 --> 09:04.740]  fucks about what happens to that product or to the consumer.
[09:04.740 --> 09:05.740]  Keep that in mind.
[09:05.740 --> 09:07.060]  We don't know what is in there.
[09:07.060 --> 09:13.220]  Now, I'm going to shift my way to talking about cannabis and cannabis concentrate cartridges
[09:13.220 --> 09:15.260]  and vaporizers.
[09:15.300 --> 09:20.860]  When we are consuming cannabis-based vaporizers, whether it is consuming cannabis in a PAX
[09:20.860 --> 09:26.020]  or a Vapor Brothers or a Volcano, or if you're smoking a concentrate in a Green Dot pen,
[09:26.020 --> 09:31.680]  however you are now consuming it, that product started off as a raw cannabis flower.
[09:31.680 --> 09:33.920]  It had to be grown as a cannabis plant.
[09:33.920 --> 09:35.860]  It had to be produced into flour.
[09:35.860 --> 09:36.860]  It had to be harvested.
[09:36.860 --> 09:38.640]  It had to go through a processing.
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.660]  There was a drying and curing, probably a slight trimming process.
[09:42.660 --> 09:46.020]  Then after that, if they choose to do so, it is turned into a concentrate.
[09:46.020 --> 09:50.100]  There are several different methods of making concentrates, several different consistencies
[09:50.100 --> 09:52.940]  and varieties of concentrates available.
[09:52.940 --> 09:58.860]  Once it is made into the appropriate concentrate, then it is put into a concentrate cartridge,
[09:58.860 --> 10:01.860]  if that is the route that concentrate is planned to take.
[10:01.860 --> 10:05.940]  Now, there are many opportunities for things to go wrong here.
[10:05.940 --> 10:07.620]  Let's think about the beginning steps.
[10:07.620 --> 10:09.460]  We're growing cannabis.
[10:09.460 --> 10:10.700]  We can get bugs.
[10:10.700 --> 10:12.140]  We can get powdery mildew.
[10:12.140 --> 10:13.620]  We can get bud rot.
[10:13.620 --> 10:20.900]  Also, we can apply a plethora of terrible pesticides and fungicides to our plants that
[10:20.900 --> 10:27.380]  will be concentrated in the concentrate that is produced from that product.
[10:27.380 --> 10:30.880]  Imagine if I have a grow room filled with plants.
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.980]  Then I dilute my pesticide properly and I spray those plants with the pesticide.
[10:35.980 --> 10:38.300]  Now eventually, we have to cut those plants down.
[10:38.300 --> 10:39.700]  They dry.
[10:39.700 --> 10:44.540]  Then we take all of that dried material and turn it into a concentrate.
[10:44.540 --> 10:50.060]  All of that pesticide that was diluted across all of those plants also comes through in
[10:50.060 --> 10:51.660]  that concentrate.
[10:51.660 --> 10:58.180]  In concentrate making, it is common to pull somewhere between 10 and 25% returns on your
[10:58.180 --> 10:59.180]  concentrate.
[10:59.180 --> 11:05.460]  So if I put in 100 grams, I should pull somewhere between 10 and 25 grams of concentrate out
[11:05.460 --> 11:07.420]  of that vat when I am done.
[11:07.420 --> 11:12.060]  Now let's think a little bit about how much pesticide has been concentrated into my vat
[11:12.060 --> 11:13.360]  of concentrate.
[11:13.360 --> 11:20.820]  It is very possible to get very high concentrations of undesirable pesticides in your concentrates
[11:20.820 --> 11:24.240]  if you use pesticides in the flowering cycle.
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.340]  You can even detect these pesticides if the pesticides were applied late in veg.
[11:29.340 --> 11:34.140]  So depending on what pesticides are used, what fungicides are used, or what molds and
[11:34.140 --> 11:38.380]  mildews were present in the plants or in the grow room, or what yeast and bacteria
[11:38.380 --> 11:43.420]  happened during the hanging and drying and curing process, we have got a lot of opportunity
[11:43.420 --> 11:48.780]  for a lot of shit to already be going into our concentrates into our lungs.
[11:48.780 --> 11:52.440]  We haven't even gotten to the extraction step of this process.
[11:52.440 --> 11:55.460]  Now we've got this possibly contaminated flower.
[11:55.460 --> 11:56.540]  We are going to cut it down.
[11:56.540 --> 11:57.540]  It's going to dry.
[11:57.540 --> 11:58.860]  We're going to cut all the leaves off of it.
[11:58.860 --> 12:02.020]  Then we're going to grind it up into little dust, and then we're going to run it through
[12:02.020 --> 12:03.420]  our concentrate machines.
[12:03.420 --> 12:06.380]  I'm not sure what type of machines you're using in your facility.
[12:06.380 --> 12:09.900]  Everybody's got their own technique, their technology, and their own equipment, but there
[12:09.900 --> 12:16.980]  are many opportunities for things to go wrong during the concentrate making process.
[12:16.980 --> 12:21.660]  Now I would hope that all concentrate makers are responsible and care about the health
[12:21.660 --> 12:23.940]  and safety of the consumer.
[12:23.940 --> 12:28.620]  Unfortunately, many people are only out for the dollar.
[12:28.700 --> 12:34.260]  Now we have the opportunity for potentially contaminated cannabis to be extracted in a
[12:34.260 --> 12:37.820]  dangerous and unsafe and unprofessional manner.
[12:37.820 --> 12:42.820]  This can lead to many problems, the main problem being contaminants in the finished product,
[12:42.820 --> 12:48.060]  whether it's mystery oils from the gases used, or if it's remaining residual hydrocarbons
[12:48.060 --> 12:49.740]  in the finished product.
[12:49.740 --> 12:55.220]  Now we have got a nice batch of concentrate that has had many opportunity for potential
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.220]  problems.
[12:56.220 --> 12:57.220]  We could have had pests.
[12:57.220 --> 12:58.580]  We could have bugs in the starting flower.
[12:58.580 --> 13:02.820]  We could have hazardous pesticides and fungicides applied to the flower.
[13:02.820 --> 13:04.300]  We could have moldy flower.
[13:04.300 --> 13:05.880]  We could have yeasty flower.
[13:05.880 --> 13:08.020]  We could have a lot of problems with the starting material.
[13:08.020 --> 13:12.340]  Then we could have really fucked it up even worse by running it through a concentrate
[13:12.340 --> 13:18.580]  machine and not properly cleaning the machine, not properly distilling our gases, not properly
[13:18.580 --> 13:20.380]  purging the finished product.
[13:20.380 --> 13:22.180]  We could have created a lot more problems.
[13:22.180 --> 13:23.380]  We could have compounded it.
[13:23.380 --> 13:27.860]  So now we've got a pesticide-laden soup that has not been purged properly.
[13:28.140 --> 13:32.700]  Now people are going to put that into a concentrate pen.
[13:32.700 --> 13:36.940]  The cartridges for these concentrate pens are readily available on several websites.
[13:36.940 --> 13:41.620]  You can buy them by the 10, you can buy them by the gross, you can buy them thousands at
[13:41.620 --> 13:42.780]  a time.
[13:42.780 --> 13:45.740]  Now that brings me back to the safety of these carts.
[13:45.740 --> 13:47.260]  Who is making these carts?
[13:47.260 --> 13:48.720]  Who oversees this?
[13:48.720 --> 13:53.700]  Who goes to China and makes sure that these carts are not being made with the shittiest,
[13:53.700 --> 13:57.700]  lowest quality, recycled metals, crappiest plastic?
[13:57.700 --> 14:00.220]  How do we know what's in any of these cartridges?
[14:00.220 --> 14:02.300]  These could be the most dangerous things on the planet.
[14:02.300 --> 14:06.340]  Like I mentioned earlier, when I hold down this button, this battery heats this product
[14:06.340 --> 14:10.180]  inside of here to a temperature where it turns it into a vapor.
[14:10.180 --> 14:11.880]  What else am I heating up?
[14:11.880 --> 14:13.800]  Am I heating up shitty hot dog metal?
[14:13.800 --> 14:15.560]  Am I heating up cheap glass?
[14:15.560 --> 14:21.340]  Am I heating up this fancy soft rubber coating on the outside here and possibly vaporizing
[14:21.340 --> 14:22.900]  that at the same time?
[14:22.900 --> 14:24.620]  I do not know.
[14:24.620 --> 14:31.140]  So we've got a lot of things to think about when it comes to using a concentrate pen.
[14:31.140 --> 14:34.580]  The most important part is clean, quality cannabis.
[14:34.580 --> 14:37.540]  The next part is a clean, quality concentrate.
[14:37.540 --> 14:39.260]  Then we have to think about something.
[14:39.260 --> 14:44.780]  When they are putting the concentrates into these cartridges, it has to be cut with something.
[14:44.780 --> 14:47.260]  What are they using for the cut?
[14:47.260 --> 14:52.660]  The reason I choose, and this is not a commercial, the reason I choose the Green Dot Labs concentrate
[14:52.700 --> 14:56.620]  pens is because these are made with nothing but live resin.
[14:56.620 --> 14:58.220]  They do not cut these at all.
[14:58.220 --> 15:02.100]  They are a little bit, they are not the cheapest pen on the market, but they are the pen that
[15:02.100 --> 15:04.540]  I choose because there is no cut.
[15:04.540 --> 15:08.740]  This is pure live resin and you can taste it and you can feel it.
[15:08.740 --> 15:14.140]  But many companies out there use a cutting agent to make their product work in the pens.
[15:14.140 --> 15:17.740]  We have to be very careful about those products.
[15:17.820 --> 15:22.780]  To the best of my understanding, several of the people who are sick or hospitalized at
[15:22.780 --> 15:28.860]  this time from using vape pens used a vape that had vitamin E in the cut.
[15:28.860 --> 15:33.660]  Now when you heat up vitamin E, it becomes vitamin E acetate, which I am not a doctor.
[15:33.660 --> 15:37.740]  I'm not going to try to explain that, but it is terrible for your lungs.
[15:37.740 --> 15:42.480]  It is catastrophic for your body and wreaks havoc on your respiratory system.
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.680]  So these people consumed a product that is not safe and they ended up in the hospital.
[15:47.720 --> 15:50.360]  So we really need to pay attention to the cut.
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.520]  The next thing we need to pay attention to is the cart itself.
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.680]  Now I know as a consumer, it is hard to know if that cartridge is safe.
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.000]  If you are buying your cartridges from the black market, whoever is selling it to you
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  is going to promise you and assure you that that is the safest cartridge on the planet.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.360]  We did all the research.
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.800]  We bought the most expensive shit we could find.
[16:12.800 --> 16:13.800]  These are safe, bro.
[16:13.800 --> 16:14.800]  I promise.
[16:14.800 --> 16:20.280]  We used the best concentrate and the safest cut, and we also used the best flowers we
[16:20.280 --> 16:21.360]  could find.
[16:21.360 --> 16:25.120]  Everybody is going to tell you that because everybody needs to make a dollar.
[16:25.120 --> 16:29.720]  Unfortunately, most people care more about making a dollar than they care about your
[16:29.720 --> 16:31.800]  health and your safety.
[16:31.800 --> 16:36.180]  People will sell you a product that puts your health and safety at risk so that they can
[16:36.180 --> 16:37.360]  pay the rent.
[16:37.360 --> 16:39.080]  They are not worried about you.
[16:39.080 --> 16:41.200]  They're worried about their family.
[16:41.200 --> 16:42.400]  So be very careful.
[16:42.800 --> 16:49.080]  I'm going to segue into talking about safety and getting your pens safely.
[16:49.080 --> 16:52.320]  A lot of people say, I know that my pens are safe.
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.160]  I bought them from whoever in the hood, but he goes somewhere and he buys a big box of
[16:57.160 --> 17:01.720]  this kind of pens and he brings them to our town and he hustles them.
[17:01.720 --> 17:04.320]  Be very careful with that.
[17:04.320 --> 17:09.680]  The same place that you buy these cartridges, they sell the boxes that they sell at the
[17:09.680 --> 17:10.680]  dispensary.
[17:10.680 --> 17:13.160]  I can get all of the popular carts.
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.320]  I can buy their packaging off of a website in bulk right now.
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.880]  So if your favorite dispensary is selling, I'm just looking around my room.
[17:20.880 --> 17:26.200]  If your favorite dispensary sells Light Switch brand carts, I can probably get Light Switch
[17:26.200 --> 17:29.400]  brand carts packaging off of the internet.
[17:29.400 --> 17:34.560]  Then I can put whatever I want into those carts and I can sell them to you and you think
[17:34.560 --> 17:40.000]  you have got Light Switch brand vape carts and you're going to smoke it with confidence.
[17:40.320 --> 17:43.520]  Now that is very dangerous and very risky.
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.600]  Who knows what you're smoking?
[17:45.600 --> 17:49.520]  First off, if they're going to bullshit you and tell you that you have got an official
[17:49.520 --> 17:54.160]  Light Switch cart and they're lying to you, they're also probably going to lie to you
[17:54.160 --> 17:57.200]  about the quality and safety of the flower.
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.920]  They are also going to lie to you about the quality and safety of the concentrate.
[18:01.920 --> 18:06.340]  They are going to continue to lie to you about the quality and the safety of whatever product
[18:06.340 --> 18:11.740]  was used to cut that concentrate to allow it to volatilize in your dab pen.
[18:11.740 --> 18:12.940]  They are not honest.
[18:12.940 --> 18:14.100]  They're going to lie to you.
[18:14.100 --> 18:15.420]  They're going to take your money.
[18:15.420 --> 18:19.280]  Then they're going to go to the store and they're going to buy the actual product they
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.960]  told you that you got.
[18:20.960 --> 18:26.260]  So they can go on social media and smoke that one and make their product look legitimate.
[18:26.260 --> 18:31.540]  Unfortunately, that is how this fucking industry is working right now and it is very frustrating.
[18:31.540 --> 18:33.220]  Now I'm all about the free market.
[18:33.220 --> 18:34.660]  I am all about the gray market.
[18:34.660 --> 18:36.140]  I'm all about the black market.
[18:36.140 --> 18:38.300]  I'm all about the regulated market.
[18:38.300 --> 18:40.300]  I'm all about the cannabis market.
[18:40.300 --> 18:42.740]  I understand that business is business.
[18:42.740 --> 18:44.980]  I understand that the hustle is the hustle.
[18:44.980 --> 18:48.740]  I understand that in your location, shit has to be done.
[18:48.740 --> 18:50.340]  Somebody needs to bring the carts.
[18:50.340 --> 18:51.340]  Somebody wants the carts.
[18:51.340 --> 18:54.140]  It is a supply and demand sort of a thing.
[18:54.140 --> 18:59.420]  I do not want to ruin anybody's black market hustle, but I'm about to fuck up your business
[18:59.420 --> 19:02.220]  just because this is how it's got to be.
[19:02.420 --> 19:08.820]  Until we can get people to be honest and quit selling shitty carts, we need to stop buying
[19:08.820 --> 19:11.340]  carts on the black market.
[19:11.340 --> 19:15.820]  Only buy your carts from a dispensary that you trust.
[19:15.820 --> 19:21.020]  Only get your THC or CBD cartridges from the dispensary.
[19:21.020 --> 19:22.620]  Don't send your friend to get them.
[19:22.620 --> 19:24.300]  Don't send your homie to get them.
[19:24.300 --> 19:28.260]  Absolutely do not buy them on social media or through the mail.
[19:28.260 --> 19:32.140]  Go to a dispensary and get a cartridge for yourself.
[19:33.060 --> 19:34.060]  I'm grabbing a cart right now.
[19:34.060 --> 19:35.900]  This package has a lab test on it.
[19:35.900 --> 19:37.700]  This has got a potency test on it.
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.740]  This has got a manufactured date on it.
[19:39.740 --> 19:44.820]  I can tell by the numbers on here where the flowers were grown, where the concentration
[19:44.820 --> 19:49.380]  was extracted, and where it was packaged by the numbers on this package.
[19:49.380 --> 19:52.340]  I can tell you that this is a Green Dot Labs concentrate.
[19:52.340 --> 19:55.580]  It was sold to me from this dispensary that is on the sticker here.
[19:55.580 --> 19:57.700]  I can tell you that the strain is five on it.
[19:57.700 --> 20:00.340]  It's a cross of Copper Kim and Infinity OG.
[20:00.340 --> 20:02.700]  It's supposed to taste like gas and pine and melons.
[20:02.700 --> 20:06.020]  It is a 0.5 milliliter concentrate cartridge.
[20:06.020 --> 20:07.980]  I've got all the appropriate numbers on here.
[20:07.980 --> 20:12.100]  I know ... Oh, and then when I pop this open, it's also got a lab test on it.
[20:12.100 --> 20:15.580]  I know that the flowers were tested for safety.
[20:15.580 --> 20:18.580]  There was no illegal pesticide in this garden.
[20:18.580 --> 20:20.700]  There were no pathogens in this garden.
[20:20.700 --> 20:22.820]  There were no yeast and molds in this flower.
[20:22.820 --> 20:25.660]  They were tested before they were turned into concentrates.
[20:26.100 --> 20:33.860]  Then, as per new Colorado state law, all concentrate must be tested for potency and residual pesticides
[20:33.860 --> 20:37.340]  before it is allowed to be sold to any consumers.
[20:37.340 --> 20:41.540]  So I know that the flowers were tested, and as a backup plan, I know that my concentrate
[20:41.540 --> 20:44.260]  was tested before it was put into this cartridge.
[20:44.260 --> 20:48.740]  I also trust my friends at Green Dot Labs to get quality carts because they are industry
[20:48.740 --> 20:51.340]  leaders and I know where to find them.
[20:51.340 --> 20:55.460]  If something goes wrong with this cartridge, I can find Green Dot Labs.
[20:55.460 --> 20:59.740]  There is an email address on here, or even easier, I would drive to the dispensary and
[20:59.740 --> 21:02.220]  I would say, hey, there's a problem with this cartridge.
[21:02.220 --> 21:03.700]  I am not satisfied.
[21:03.700 --> 21:05.900]  The dispensary would solve the problem for me.
[21:05.900 --> 21:10.460]  If it was a medical or a health issue, they would contact Green Dot Labs directly and
[21:10.460 --> 21:12.380]  Green Dot would help me out.
[21:12.380 --> 21:15.100]  Green Dot isn't just some dude in the hood with a fake name.
[21:15.100 --> 21:17.140]  I know where to go find Green Dot.
[21:17.140 --> 21:22.900]  Green Dot has an office with representatives and managers and best of all, lawyers and
[21:22.900 --> 21:27.500]  all of the proper channels to support themselves if something does go wrong.
[21:27.500 --> 21:32.580]  But the best part is, they are so heavily regulated and monitored that I can smoke this
[21:32.580 --> 21:34.140]  pen with confidence.
[21:34.140 --> 21:36.060]  I am sure nothing is going to go wrong.
[21:36.060 --> 21:38.740]  Again, the flowers were tested multiple times.
[21:38.740 --> 21:40.980]  The concentrate was tested again.
[21:40.980 --> 21:45.500]  Then I trust Green Dot because they are a reputable company and I know this is a real
[21:45.500 --> 21:50.180]  Green Dot concentrate cartridge because I bought this at my favorite dispensary.
[21:50.180 --> 21:54.500]  So I know I just shit all over the black market for a minute, but until we can get
[21:54.500 --> 22:00.660]  people to be honest, we need to buy our carts from reputable dispensaries.
[22:00.660 --> 22:07.460]  Now I don't think any of the health concerns or problems right now are caused by store
[22:07.460 --> 22:09.340]  bought legitimate vape pens.
[22:09.340 --> 22:14.380]  I think to the best of my knowledge, most of the problems have been from e-juice or
[22:14.380 --> 22:16.020]  nicotine vapes.
[22:16.020 --> 22:19.580]  I admit that I did not go read the news before I came here to record.
[22:19.980 --> 22:23.260]  I had this idea fresh in my head and wanted to get it out while it was hot.
[22:23.260 --> 22:26.060]  So I did not do the proper research.
[22:26.060 --> 22:31.860]  But the way to avoid any of these problems is to not vape random shit.
[22:31.860 --> 22:36.500]  If somebody passes you something and you are not certain where it came from, you may want
[22:36.500 --> 22:37.500]  to skip on it.
[22:37.500 --> 22:41.540]  Whether it's a nicotine vape, whether it's a cannabis vape, whether it is a concentrate
[22:41.540 --> 22:46.340]  pen, now is the time to start being a little conceited and a little bit discerning about
[22:46.340 --> 22:48.660]  the products that we do consume.
[22:48.740 --> 22:52.860]  And I understand that there are some areas of our great country where you cannot go to
[22:52.860 --> 22:56.660]  the dispensary and grab yourself a reliable Green Dot Labs pen.
[22:56.660 --> 22:57.940]  I get that.
[22:57.940 --> 23:02.420]  Until we can get everybody to be honest and start thinking about our health and our safety
[23:02.420 --> 23:07.300]  and stop worrying so much about their wallets, we need to be a little bit more discerning
[23:07.300 --> 23:11.420]  about where we spend our money and what we put into our bodies.
[23:11.420 --> 23:12.620]  Now I get it.
[23:12.620 --> 23:14.860]  You might not have another opportunity.
[23:14.860 --> 23:18.700]  Those carts and pens may be the thing that comes around in your area.
[23:18.700 --> 23:20.300]  Now you have to make a decision.
[23:20.300 --> 23:22.600]  Is it really worth risking my lung health?
[23:22.600 --> 23:26.480]  Is it really worth risking my future, my entire body health?
[23:26.480 --> 23:27.540]  You only get one body.
[23:27.540 --> 23:28.900]  You only got two lungs.
[23:28.900 --> 23:31.260]  When you fuck those up, that might be it.
[23:31.260 --> 23:33.940]  So do you want to get high that bad?
[23:33.940 --> 23:35.860]  That is another part of this problem.
[23:35.860 --> 23:40.700]  For every shitty dealer out there selling what we're calling a booth cart, there is
[23:40.700 --> 23:44.180]  another guy out there who's going, man, I wish I could find a fucking cart.
[23:44.180 --> 23:48.060]  And they don't even care that it is going to put their health at risk.
[23:48.060 --> 23:51.100]  So please don't be the guy buying a shitty cart.
[23:51.100 --> 23:55.300]  Don't be the guy supporting the shitty cart sales people.
[23:55.300 --> 23:56.300]  Educate yourself.
[23:56.300 --> 23:58.860]  And if you can, educate your friends.
[23:58.860 --> 24:03.060]  Unfortunately, when it comes to health and safety and consumption of products that make
[24:03.060 --> 24:06.700]  us feel a certain way, most people don't give a shit about education.
[24:06.700 --> 24:09.860]  They're going to do what they like to do, what makes them feel good.
[24:09.860 --> 24:12.080]  We want instant gratification as humans.
[24:12.080 --> 24:16.680]  If it makes me feel good now but kills me in 10 years, I might be okay with that.
[24:16.680 --> 24:19.180]  That's just how we are as people, some of us.
[24:19.180 --> 24:21.080]  So the best I can say is educate yourself.
[24:21.080 --> 24:23.520]  I hope I taught you something here today.
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.680]  Educate your friends if they will listen and be very careful about the products which you
[24:27.680 --> 24:28.680]  consume.
[24:28.680 --> 24:29.680]  Don't be a fiend.
[24:29.680 --> 24:35.120]  I love to smoke, but I pass on plenty of shitty looking concentrates and I rarely hit anybody
[24:35.120 --> 24:36.120]  else's pen.
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.760]  So again, this was not meant to be a Green Dot Labs concentrate or a pen commercial,
[24:42.440 --> 24:43.440]  but they are the product that I trust right now.
[24:43.440 --> 24:46.240]  I know that they are putting pure live resin into these pens.
[24:46.240 --> 24:48.380]  It gets me heavily medicated.
[24:48.380 --> 24:49.380]  It tastes great.
[24:49.380 --> 24:54.580]  And I have experienced zero adverse side effects from this product.
[24:54.580 --> 24:59.920]  So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, that is my rant on vape pens
[24:59.920 --> 25:01.200]  and vape carts.
[25:01.200 --> 25:02.400]  You are an adult.
[25:02.400 --> 25:03.620]  Please be safe out there.
[25:03.620 --> 25:05.320]  Please use your best judgment.
[25:05.320 --> 25:09.860]  Please trust wherever your concentrates and your concentrate pens are coming from.
[25:09.980 --> 25:15.420]  I don't want to hear about any of you in the hospital from a terrible concentrate pen experience.
[25:15.420 --> 25:16.760]  Please take care of yourself.
[25:16.760 --> 25:17.980]  Take care of your loved ones.
[25:17.980 --> 25:19.020]  Be good to one another.
[25:19.020 --> 25:20.180]  I'm going to wrap up this episode.
