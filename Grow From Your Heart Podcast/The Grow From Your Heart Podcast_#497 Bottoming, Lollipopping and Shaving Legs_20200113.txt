[00:00.000 --> 00:02.120]  All right, podcast world, welcome back.
[00:02.120 --> 00:03.880]  It is time for episode 497
[00:03.880 --> 00:05.280]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.280 --> 00:06.600]  Of course, this episode is brought to you
[00:06.600 --> 00:08.560]  by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:08.560 --> 00:11.320]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds,
[00:11.320 --> 00:13.240]  I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[00:13.240 --> 00:18.240]  and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.720 --> 00:22.680]  Joining me on today's podcast, to my left is White Mike,
[00:22.680 --> 00:24.480]  and right in front of me is Double Door Dank,
[00:24.480 --> 00:25.320]  also known as Matt.
[00:25.320 --> 00:26.760]  Welcome to the show, gentlemen.
[00:26.760 --> 00:27.760]  What's up, man?
[00:27.760 --> 00:28.600]  How's it going?
[00:28.600 --> 00:29.800]  I'm fucking stoned, bro.
[00:29.800 --> 00:31.000]  Thank you for being here, guys.
[00:31.000 --> 00:31.840]  Yeah?
[00:31.840 --> 00:32.680]  Yeah, thanks for having us, man.
[00:32.680 --> 00:34.120]  I usually start the podcast off
[00:34.120 --> 00:35.560]  by talking about what we're smoking.
[00:35.560 --> 00:37.280]  We have had kind of a buffet of flowers.
[00:37.280 --> 00:38.280]  We've been smoking lots of shit.
[00:38.280 --> 00:39.200]  Yeah, lots of shit.
[00:39.200 --> 00:40.880]  A buffet of flowers and concentrates,
[00:40.880 --> 00:42.320]  a smorgasbord, if you will.
[00:42.320 --> 00:44.160]  We are all nice and baked here.
[00:44.160 --> 00:45.720]  The one that I just took a dab of
[00:45.720 --> 00:47.240]  that really stood out to me
[00:47.240 --> 00:50.720]  was the Fuzzy Naval Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:50.720 --> 00:53.720]  This is a cross of Jilly 13 and Peach Oz.
[00:53.720 --> 00:55.320]  On the package, the flavor is described
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.800]  as orange push pop and peach daiquiri.
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.840]  I definitely got the orange push pop.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.480]  I'm not sure about the peach daiquiri
[01:02.480 --> 01:04.680]  because I don't drink, so I'm not sure
[01:04.680 --> 01:05.560]  what that tastes like. There's some peach
[01:05.560 --> 01:07.520]  in there on the Afterglow, but.
[01:07.520 --> 01:08.960]  The Afterglow, huh?
[01:08.960 --> 01:09.800]  Yep.
[01:09.800 --> 01:10.640]  I'm digging that.
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.480]  You got Afterglow in your mouth.
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.200]  All right, but the Fuzzy Naval from Green Dot Labs,
[01:13.200 --> 01:16.880]  that's the orange push pop and peach daiquiri.
[01:16.880 --> 01:19.560]  On the back of the package, it says the product contains
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.560]  63.93% THC and non-detectable amount of CBD.
[01:24.600 --> 01:27.640]  I'm popping it open right now to give myself a fresh smell.
[01:27.640 --> 01:29.560]  It smells like orange rinds and candy
[01:29.560 --> 01:30.400]  coming out of the package.
[01:30.400 --> 01:31.240]  I really dig it.
[01:31.240 --> 01:33.240]  So shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.200]  for the Fuzzy Naval Live Batter.
[01:36.200 --> 01:38.080]  We were also smoking some flowers.
[01:38.080 --> 01:40.440]  Do those flowers have a name, bro?
[01:42.720 --> 01:43.560]  I don't know.
[01:43.560 --> 01:45.680]  Every time I try to tell somebody what the cross is,
[01:45.680 --> 01:46.860]  they keep calling it motorboat,
[01:46.860 --> 01:48.360]  so I guess we're just going with motorboat.
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.200]  Fuck it.
[01:49.200 --> 01:50.040]  We smoked something called motorboat.
[01:50.040 --> 01:51.400]  It's been dubbed the motorboat.
[01:51.400 --> 01:53.240]  Nice, official announcement, motorboat.
[01:53.240 --> 01:55.600]  That says that now and later and motor breath.
[01:55.600 --> 01:56.600]  Yeah, I'm digging that, dude.
[01:56.600 --> 01:57.440]  It's got a nice,
[01:58.240 --> 02:01.200]  it's got the grape leather flavor.
[02:01.200 --> 02:03.000]  Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.280]  I did a lot of searching to get something
[02:05.280 --> 02:06.440]  kind of unique in my garden,
[02:06.440 --> 02:09.680]  and this is the one that actually stuck around.
[02:09.680 --> 02:13.160]  It was the culmination of my year of hard work.
[02:13.160 --> 02:14.120]  Great find, bro.
[02:14.120 --> 02:14.960]  That's a good product.
[02:14.960 --> 02:15.780]  I dig it.
[02:15.780 --> 02:16.800]  Everybody in the room is nicely stoned.
[02:16.800 --> 02:18.640]  Mike's just smiling at the microphone right now.
[02:18.640 --> 02:20.440]  I just enjoy when a year of hard work
[02:20.440 --> 02:21.960]  can end up in a mason jar.
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.080]  Something cool has happened over the last year.
[02:25.080 --> 02:25.920]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:25.920 --> 02:26.760]  Absolutely.
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.200]  Everybody in the room got to enjoy the hard work
[02:29.200 --> 02:30.040]  that came out of that mason jar.
[02:30.040 --> 02:30.880]  Yeah, well done, bro.
[02:30.880 --> 02:32.320]  And now the room still smells like that mason jar.
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.480]  So good work, dude.
[02:33.480 --> 02:34.480]  Thank you.
[02:34.480 --> 02:36.640]  I hope you guys enjoyed the leathery,
[02:36.640 --> 02:39.680]  you know, peach, whatever smell you get from it.
[02:39.680 --> 02:41.960]  We keep smoking it, dude, so we must like it.
[02:41.960 --> 02:43.360]  Yeah, you left me a bag of it,
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.640]  and I don't smoke a lot of flowers,
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.600]  but I'm smoking through that bag that you left me.
[02:46.600 --> 02:47.880]  I keep a bowl of it sitting around
[02:47.880 --> 02:50.160]  so that sometimes if I'm just passing from room to room
[02:50.160 --> 02:51.520]  and I walk by the table where the bowl is,
[02:51.520 --> 02:52.400]  I just pick it up and hit it.
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.920]  Fuck it, let's keep the buzz going.
[02:53.920 --> 02:55.360]  It's kind of nice.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.200]  All right.
[02:56.320 --> 02:57.280]  Usually at this point in the show,
[02:57.280 --> 02:59.000]  we give a shout out to our friends from Patreon.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.280]  Let's quickly give shout outs to the folks
[03:01.280 --> 03:03.000]  who support the show on Patreon.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.360]  Let's start off with a big giant shout out to Big Toe Grows.
[03:06.360 --> 03:08.440]  I also want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[03:08.440 --> 03:10.440]  shout out to Zozo J.
[03:10.440 --> 03:12.720]  I need to send a big thank you to JM.
[03:12.720 --> 03:15.200]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out to Tommy.
[03:15.200 --> 03:16.960]  Of course, we need to send a big thank you shout out
[03:16.960 --> 03:18.280]  to Steve Smith.
[03:18.280 --> 03:20.120]  How about a thank you to Ruffling Tim?
[03:20.120 --> 03:22.960]  I always want to send a high five to Dan the Indoor Man.
[03:22.960 --> 03:24.760]  Of course, a big hug and a high five
[03:24.800 --> 03:26.400]  to Stabby McStabwood.
[03:26.400 --> 03:28.720]  I always want to send a big thank you to Bafsta.
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.760]  Another thank you to Victor.
[03:30.760 --> 03:32.520]  Big shout out to my buddy Bong Breath.
[03:32.520 --> 03:34.600]  Of course, I need to send a big thank you shout out
[03:34.600 --> 03:35.440]  to Tyler.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.960]  And last but certainly not least,
[03:36.960 --> 03:39.320]  how about a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[03:39.320 --> 03:42.120]  high five thank you shout out to our buddy Nomi
[03:42.120 --> 03:44.280]  by my guacamole.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.720]  Thanks for all of the continued support.
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.840]  A lot of recognizable and repeat names in there.
[03:48.840 --> 03:49.800]  Thank you guys.
[03:49.800 --> 03:52.240]  And if anybody else out there would like to learn
[03:52.240 --> 03:53.720]  how to support the show on Patreon,

[03:57.840 --> 03:59.920]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:59.920 --> 04:01.800]  Of course, all of the information you need to help the show
[04:01.800 --> 04:03.120]  will be right there on the screen.
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.400]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[04:05.400 --> 04:08.560]  who supports the show via Patreon.
[04:08.560 --> 04:10.280]  All right, I've got a couple of great friends here,
[04:10.280 --> 04:12.040]  a very experienced grower
[04:12.040 --> 04:14.080]  and another semi experienced grower,
[04:14.080 --> 04:16.600]  but two qualified people to be on an episode.
[04:16.600 --> 04:17.760]  Let's do a grow lesson.
[04:17.760 --> 04:19.200]  In this episode,
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.360]  let's talk a little bit about lollipopping our plants,
[04:22.360 --> 04:24.840]  maybe a little technique that I call bottoming the plant.
[04:24.840 --> 04:27.200]  And we'll also talk about what we call shaving the legs.
[04:27.200 --> 04:28.480]  It's kind of the same thing.
[04:28.480 --> 04:29.920]  It's all the same approach.
[04:29.920 --> 04:32.240]  It's all got the same idea behind it.
[04:32.240 --> 04:35.080]  So let's jump right into a grow lesson.
[04:35.080 --> 04:36.960]  What we're gonna talk about bottoming,
[04:36.960 --> 04:38.680]  lollipopping and shaving the legs.
[04:38.680 --> 04:40.040]  That is the what.
[04:40.040 --> 04:42.720]  Let's talk about why we want to do that.
[04:42.720 --> 04:44.000]  What is the point of,
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.680]  and we'll talk more about what bottoming
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.880]  and lollipopping and shaving the legs are.
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.200]  That's just the basics of what we're gonna cover.
[04:50.240 --> 04:53.240]  Why do we want to do this sort of technique?
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.240]  In a small grow, in a large grow,
[04:55.240 --> 04:56.680]  in any type of grow environment,
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.920]  much of the stuff on the bottom of your plant,
[04:58.920 --> 05:01.400]  unless maybe you're running a Coliseum grow,
[05:01.400 --> 05:02.880]  much of the crap on the bottom
[05:02.880 --> 05:05.920]  isn't going to be a very useful bud.
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.760]  It's not gonna be very productive.
[05:06.760 --> 05:09.280]  You're not ending up with an A or a B level.
[05:09.280 --> 05:10.800]  Yeah, that's gonna be the stuff
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.360]  that ends up in the trim bin
[05:12.360 --> 05:13.960]  that you're going to turn into concentrates
[05:13.960 --> 05:15.560]  or that you'll make edibles out of.
[05:15.560 --> 05:16.400]  That you'll be like,
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.720]  this is so small and annoying to trim.
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.800]  I don't want to fuck with it.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.040]  We're talking about stuff
[05:21.040 --> 05:24.800]  whose final potential is at best a C.
[05:24.800 --> 05:25.640]  Yes.
[05:25.640 --> 05:27.040]  And so it's so much easier
[05:27.040 --> 05:29.000]  to just remove it from the equation.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.120]  Way early before it even has a chance
[05:31.120 --> 05:32.480]  to be part of the equation.
[05:32.480 --> 05:35.720]  And potentially even help the buds up top.
[05:35.720 --> 05:36.720]  Oh, for sure.
[05:36.720 --> 05:38.600]  The plant's only got so much,
[05:38.600 --> 05:39.800]  you know, it can only eat so much.
[05:39.800 --> 05:41.840]  It can only dedicate so much energy to growth.
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.760]  And if you're taking away energy,
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.240]  it could be spending growing a C quality bottom nug
[05:47.240 --> 05:50.280]  to a cola up top by all means do it.
[05:50.280 --> 05:51.120]  For sure.
[05:51.120 --> 05:51.960]  You guys got the right idea.
[05:51.960 --> 05:53.040]  And we're not gonna get light down there.
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.960]  That's why those buds are gonna be crappy.
[05:54.960 --> 05:55.920]  There's not gonna be any light.
[05:55.920 --> 05:57.560]  The light gets stopped by every leaf,
[05:57.560 --> 05:59.560]  every bud on the way down.
[05:59.560 --> 06:01.320]  So by the time we get down there to the bottom,
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.440]  you just got a little popcorn.
[06:02.440 --> 06:04.400]  We call it LARF where I'm from.
[06:04.400 --> 06:05.240]  It's got a different name.
[06:05.240 --> 06:06.080]  LARF nuggets.
[06:06.080 --> 06:07.520]  Yeah, it's got a different name in every circle,
[06:07.520 --> 06:08.360]  but it's LARF.
[06:08.360 --> 06:09.200]  It's a little fluffy crap.
[06:09.200 --> 06:10.240]  We don't need that.
[06:10.240 --> 06:13.760]  Also by taking off a lot of the unnecessary crap,
[06:13.760 --> 06:15.320]  we increase the air flow.
[06:15.320 --> 06:16.600]  And by increasing air flow,
[06:16.600 --> 06:19.200]  we increase the overall health of the entire room.
[06:20.120 --> 06:20.960]  Excuse me.
[06:20.960 --> 06:25.000]  And reduce the likelihood of a number of negative events.
[06:25.000 --> 06:25.840]  There you go.
[06:25.840 --> 06:26.680]  We reduce humidity.
[06:26.680 --> 06:28.880]  We reduce respiration and transpiration.
[06:28.880 --> 06:31.360]  We reduce the opportunity for powdery mildew
[06:31.360 --> 06:32.800]  with less foliage.
[06:32.800 --> 06:35.120]  Those are less places for pests to hide.
[06:35.120 --> 06:37.240]  Also it is easier and more effective
[06:37.240 --> 06:39.120]  when we do apply a pesticide,
[06:39.120 --> 06:40.520]  if we're applying a spray.
[06:40.520 --> 06:43.120]  Even stupid stuff like you can see better.
[06:43.120 --> 06:46.200]  You can get to the pot and water it easier.
[06:46.800 --> 06:49.400]  You can see if the spray nozzles on your watering system
[06:49.400 --> 06:50.440]  are functioning properly.
[06:50.440 --> 06:51.480]  All of it.
[06:51.480 --> 06:52.320]  Absolutely.
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.760]  That's perfect.
[06:53.760 --> 06:54.600]  So many good ideas.
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.440]  Go ahead, Matt.
[06:55.440 --> 06:57.640]  And it's kind of strain specific too.
[06:57.640 --> 06:59.000]  It's kind of one of those things
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.320]  where you want to know the plant you're working with
[07:02.320 --> 07:03.960]  maybe the first time you do it.
[07:03.960 --> 07:06.200]  You don't go as hard.
[07:06.200 --> 07:08.360]  Yeah, go light and slowly work up.
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.000]  You can't glue leaf back on,
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  but you can take off more tomorrow or the day after.
[07:14.000 --> 07:14.840]  Exactly.
[07:15.040 --> 07:17.200]  I've got that written down on how much.
[07:17.200 --> 07:18.320]  It's strain dependent
[07:18.320 --> 07:20.840]  and it's also environmentally dependent.
[07:20.840 --> 07:23.320]  If you've got a room with a lot of light,
[07:23.320 --> 07:25.160]  you're going to produce more leaf.
[07:25.160 --> 07:26.720]  You're going to produce more branch.
[07:26.720 --> 07:28.640]  You're going to need to cut off more stuff.
[07:28.640 --> 07:29.880]  If you've got big pots,
[07:29.880 --> 07:31.240]  you're going to produce bigger plants
[07:31.240 --> 07:32.880]  with more shit to cut off.
[07:32.880 --> 07:35.600]  If you've got something like an OG Kush
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.480]  that grows like kind of lanky,
[07:37.480 --> 07:38.520]  you're not going to want to take off
[07:38.520 --> 07:39.520]  as much shit off the bottom
[07:39.520 --> 07:41.720]  because you won't leave as much stuff up the top.
[07:41.720 --> 07:43.800]  If you've got something like strawberry starburst,
[07:43.800 --> 07:44.640]  she gets branchy.
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.280]  You could probably take off
[07:46.280 --> 07:47.120]  quite a bit of that bottom stuff.
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.000]  So it's very strain dependent.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.680]  It's very environment dependent.
[07:50.680 --> 07:52.400]  If you've got weak lights,
[07:52.400 --> 07:53.720]  you don't want to take off as much
[07:53.720 --> 07:55.440]  or you may need to take off even more.
[07:55.440 --> 07:57.080]  You're not going to get as much growth,
[07:57.080 --> 07:59.400]  but you're also not going to get as much light penetration.
[07:59.400 --> 08:00.560]  So you've got to do that.
[08:00.560 --> 08:01.440]  Do I take this off?
[08:01.440 --> 08:02.280]  Do I leave it?
[08:02.280 --> 08:03.280]  Is the light going to get to it?
[08:03.280 --> 08:05.920]  There's a decision to be made when it comes to bottoming.
[08:05.920 --> 08:07.760]  We'll talk about that pretty soon,
[08:07.760 --> 08:10.840]  but we want to kind of clean up the bottoms.
[08:10.840 --> 08:13.200]  Let's talk about what I mean by lollipopping
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.600]  and bottoming and shaving the legs.
[08:15.440 --> 08:16.280]  It's basically all the same thing,
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.800]  but slightly different variations of the same words.
[08:18.800 --> 08:20.280]  By bottoming, I mean,
[08:20.280 --> 08:22.480]  so you've got a plant that's growing naturally.
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.320]  It's got a-
[08:23.320 --> 08:24.400]  Kind of looks like a Christmas tree.
[08:24.400 --> 08:25.640]  Yeah, it sort of looks like a Christmas tree,
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.800]  but on the bottom, you've got multiple branches coming out
[08:27.800 --> 08:29.920]  and then up higher, you got more branches.
[08:29.920 --> 08:32.360]  Those bottom branches are probably thin and wispy.
[08:32.360 --> 08:34.280]  Maybe some of them are kind of substantial,
[08:34.280 --> 08:36.640]  but you can see where the light doesn't get to.
[08:36.640 --> 08:39.400]  If you take those branches off the bottom,
[08:39.400 --> 08:40.600]  you don't waste that energy
[08:40.600 --> 08:41.960]  like we were talking about earlier,
[08:41.960 --> 08:43.320]  weight growing those bottom buds
[08:43.320 --> 08:45.080]  that aren't going to amount to anything.
[08:45.080 --> 08:48.000]  Then you can put the energy from that plant up to the top.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.480]  You've still got the same root space.
[08:49.480 --> 08:51.640]  You're going to feed the same amount of nutrients.
[08:51.640 --> 08:53.600]  It's like if I just took your backpack off of you
[08:53.600 --> 08:55.800]  and told you to run laps, you don't have that backpack.
[08:55.800 --> 08:57.480]  You can go a little bit faster.
[08:57.480 --> 08:58.480]  We're just going to make that plant
[08:58.480 --> 09:00.480]  a little bit more high performance.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.280]  So that's basically bottoming.
[09:02.280 --> 09:04.280]  Take that crap off the bottom.
[09:04.280 --> 09:06.440]  Now, when I talk about lollipopping,
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.480]  there are a couple that's kind of the same thing as bottoming,
[09:08.480 --> 09:10.520]  but I like to work my way.
[09:10.520 --> 09:13.280]  I kind of determine how far the light is going to penetrate.
[09:14.040 --> 09:15.200]  I do a little defoliation
[09:15.200 --> 09:17.480]  so I can see where the light gets down.
[09:17.480 --> 09:18.600]  Then I'm looking at my plant.
[09:18.600 --> 09:20.600]  I see the light doesn't get to about this branch.
[09:20.600 --> 09:23.320]  Any branch below there, it's coming off.
[09:23.320 --> 09:25.360]  Then branches that reach
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.480]  or branches that have potential to get up to the light,
[09:28.480 --> 09:30.360]  I clean them up to where just the tips
[09:30.360 --> 09:32.200]  may have some leaves at the end.
[09:32.200 --> 09:35.560]  Don't feel afraid to have a naked branch with just a tip
[09:35.560 --> 09:36.880]  if the tips are reaching up
[09:36.880 --> 09:38.720]  to where they will get enough light.
[09:38.720 --> 09:40.280]  If you're hanging a trellis,
[09:40.600 --> 09:43.440]  lollipop everything below the first net.
[09:43.440 --> 09:44.280]  Yep.
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.120]  And this is really important in developing your canopy,
[09:48.120 --> 09:50.120]  especially if you want a really even canopy
[09:50.120 --> 09:52.440]  where everything comes out consistent
[09:53.400 --> 09:55.200]  all the way across.
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.000]  Lollipopping up is going to really
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.360]  increase your upper canopy.
[10:00.360 --> 10:02.000]  Yeah, how this works in practice
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.960]  really depends on your growth style
[10:03.960 --> 10:06.000]  and method and your plans for your plants.
[10:06.000 --> 10:06.840]  Absolutely.
[10:06.840 --> 10:09.760]  How much you cut off, when and how and why you do it
[10:10.200 --> 10:11.760]  all is kind of about your goal.
[10:11.760 --> 10:13.600]  But we've all got kind of the right idea
[10:13.600 --> 10:15.520]  to just clean up that bottom part
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.000]  and kind of get more energy up to the top.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  And also, like you said, it will help work on the canopy.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.680]  We all want that even canopy.
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.200]  Most of us want a nice, even canopy.
[10:22.200 --> 10:23.520]  In a commercial environment,
[10:23.520 --> 10:25.360]  that big one giant glory bud,
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.560]  that donkey dick to take pictures of, that's useless.
[10:27.560 --> 10:30.800]  We need a bunch of usable product that is very uniform.
[10:30.800 --> 10:33.040]  If you've got one big bud, you've got problems,
[10:33.040 --> 10:35.400]  you can get mold in there, you can get mildew in there.
[10:35.400 --> 10:36.240]  You don't want all that.
[10:36.240 --> 10:37.840]  You just want a bunch of consistent buds.
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.800]  We spread it out using a screen.
[10:39.800 --> 10:41.920]  So I would use one screen to spread.
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.000]  A plant's growing straight up and branching straight up.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.280]  I would put a screen down.
[10:45.280 --> 10:47.440]  And now all those branches that are going straight up,
[10:47.440 --> 10:49.000]  I would kind of spread them out a little bit.
[10:49.000 --> 10:49.960]  Instead of going straight up,
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.320]  now they've got some sort of, what's that, horizontal growth.
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.760]  The net slows them down.
[10:54.760 --> 10:56.240]  Then they kind of fill more space.
[10:56.240 --> 10:59.360]  Instead of going up, you've got more square footage wide.
[10:59.360 --> 11:00.800]  I would put that first net down,
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.160]  let them grow up a little bit,
[11:02.160 --> 11:04.680]  let them grow into the second net, and then flower them.
[11:04.680 --> 11:06.720]  Everything below that first net,
[11:06.760 --> 11:08.480]  you've got what I call little sucker buds.
[11:08.480 --> 11:11.760]  Just little finger size, their shoots is what they are.
[11:11.760 --> 11:12.920]  Just little worthless shoots
[11:12.920 --> 11:14.200]  that aren't going to measure up too much.
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.480]  If it's smaller than a pencil in a commercial grow,
[11:16.480 --> 11:18.880]  I basically cut it off of the main branch.
[11:18.880 --> 11:21.400]  So you've got branches that come up from the bottom.
[11:21.400 --> 11:23.680]  All of the non-substantial branches come off.
[11:23.680 --> 11:25.320]  You leave the main branches.
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.920]  All the way up to where the light happens,
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.000]  you take off all that sucker crap and all the leaves.
[11:31.080 --> 11:32.000]  So that's what I give you,
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.560]  or what we call in a commercial environment,
[11:33.560 --> 11:34.840]  nice looking shaved legs.
[11:34.880 --> 11:37.280]  You just see those sexy stalks, those nice shaved legs,
[11:37.280 --> 11:40.080]  and then your canopy kind of makes like a skirt.
[11:40.080 --> 11:43.200]  Yeah, and developing your canopy across there
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.200]  is just gonna give you that consistency in your product.
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.880]  The lower stuff's never gonna help you out.
[11:51.880 --> 11:53.760]  It's never gonna get the light penetration.
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.480]  You have to think of it kind of like the old slab,
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.840]  slap, slad windows where they close
[12:02.800 --> 12:06.400]  with a little drawstring.
[12:06.400 --> 12:07.240]  Okay.
[12:07.240 --> 12:08.800]  Kind of like blind, well, I guess fucking just blind.
[12:08.800 --> 12:09.640]  It's fucking A.
[12:09.640 --> 12:11.280]  I'm fucking high, I'm sorry.
[12:11.280 --> 12:12.880]  We took dabs, it's cool.
[12:12.880 --> 12:14.680]  But anyway, it works like blinds.
[12:14.680 --> 12:18.000]  Your fan leaves are blocking out a lot of that light.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.360]  It's not getting through to those bottom things
[12:21.480 --> 12:24.640]  unless you're doing vertical growing like where I'm doing.
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.520]  They'll kind of open up
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.520]  and direct themselves towards the light.
[12:32.080 --> 12:33.960]  Work themselves towards whichever direction.
[12:33.960 --> 12:37.160]  But if you're doing standard canopy and training,
[12:37.160 --> 12:41.480]  you're gonna get a lot more success from your top end.
[12:41.480 --> 12:43.840]  And remember that you can't glue shit back on
[12:43.840 --> 12:44.680]  once you cut it off.
[12:44.680 --> 12:46.520]  So cut a little bit, kind of check it out.
[12:46.520 --> 12:47.640]  Cut a little bit more.
[12:47.640 --> 12:48.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:49.400 --> 12:52.720]  We always recommend if you're gonna try a new technique
[12:52.720 --> 12:55.880]  or a new product to try it on one or two plants
[12:55.880 --> 12:58.680]  and wait for a few days or a week
[12:58.680 --> 13:00.200]  and see how that plant reacts
[13:00.240 --> 13:02.280]  rather than do it to the whole garden
[13:02.280 --> 13:04.440]  and come in tomorrow morning to realize
[13:04.440 --> 13:07.400]  you read the label wrong and now all your plants are dead.
[13:07.400 --> 13:08.240]  Yeah.
[13:08.240 --> 13:11.960]  Well, it goes back to setting yourself up for success too.
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.840]  All of those steps you're doing in preparation for flower
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.000]  so that way when you go to flip,
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.320]  everything is just gonna be spot on and ready.
[13:20.320 --> 13:23.720]  And you even do some of that in flower.
[13:23.720 --> 13:25.440]  But all of that is just preparation
[13:25.440 --> 13:30.040]  so the plant can develop to be exactly what you intended.
[13:30.880 --> 13:32.080]  So with that in mind, you've got to think about
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.160]  what is this plant going to look like in three days?
[13:35.160 --> 13:36.640]  What's it gonna look like in a week?
[13:36.640 --> 13:38.800]  What will it look like in 10 days or two weeks
[13:38.800 --> 13:40.720]  because of what I'm doing right now?
[13:40.720 --> 13:42.280]  So when you pull off those little shoots,
[13:42.280 --> 13:43.360]  those won't grow back.
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.440]  When you cut off those branches, they will not grow back.
[13:46.440 --> 13:48.040]  The plants grow from the top.
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.760]  All the new growth comes out of the top.
[13:49.760 --> 13:51.480]  So don't expect anything down on the bottom
[13:51.480 --> 13:52.760]  to replace itself.
[13:52.760 --> 13:55.040]  I know some people thought, well, won't that stuff grow back?
[13:55.040 --> 13:56.200]  No, you cut it off, dude.
[13:56.200 --> 13:57.640]  It's not coming back.
[13:58.600 --> 13:59.560]  It's gone.
[13:59.560 --> 14:01.040]  It is gone for good.
[14:01.040 --> 14:03.960]  If you're not familiar with the cannabis plant
[14:03.960 --> 14:05.720]  and you're totally lost right now,
[14:05.720 --> 14:07.920]  what we're talking about is taking a plant
[14:07.920 --> 14:09.720]  that wants to grow like a Christmas tree
[14:09.720 --> 14:12.000]  and making it grow like a menorah.
[14:12.000 --> 14:12.840]  Basically, yes.
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.080]  With the goal of an increased overall harvest weight.
[14:16.080 --> 14:17.800]  So basically in a commercial environment,
[14:17.800 --> 14:20.240]  when we move the plants into the room, they start growing.
[14:20.240 --> 14:22.080]  We've got a table and the table is filled
[14:22.080 --> 14:24.680]  with three gallon pots that are in nice straight lines.
[14:24.680 --> 14:27.120]  If you look down the row, you can't see through the row
[14:27.120 --> 14:28.560]  to the other end of the room.
[14:28.560 --> 14:30.600]  When I get done bottoming and lollipopping
[14:30.600 --> 14:32.720]  and shaving the legs, it's like a little tunnel.
[14:32.720 --> 14:34.000]  You could see all the way down
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.320]  to the other end of that table.
[14:35.320 --> 14:38.120]  There's like a good 12 to 16, maybe 18 inch gap,
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.480]  where you could just see nothing but sexy looking
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.040]  shaved legs and irrigation lines.
[14:44.760 --> 14:47.360]  There's the scene in the horror movie
[14:47.360 --> 14:49.760]  where like the lights kind of on and off
[14:49.760 --> 14:52.480]  and the scary thing like moves real fast up the hallway,
[14:52.480 --> 14:55.440]  like in chunks, like either the lights are going off
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.400]  and it's getting darker coming close to you
[14:57.400 --> 14:59.800]  or the scary things running at you like that.
[14:59.800 --> 15:00.960]  There's so many things in a grow,
[15:00.960 --> 15:03.160]  like filling up a room with plants.
[15:03.160 --> 15:05.120]  I would always take pictures that made it look
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.440]  like the plants were rushing up behind me,
[15:07.440 --> 15:09.360]  like that filling up or going through
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.000]  and lollipopping a room.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.840]  Like after the first day,
[15:12.840 --> 15:15.440]  you can see the first four rows deep.
[15:15.440 --> 15:16.560]  And by the end of the week,
[15:16.560 --> 15:18.400]  you can see all the way through the fucking big room.
[15:18.400 --> 15:20.400]  And it's weird because you can never see all the way
[15:20.400 --> 15:21.800]  through the big room.
[15:21.800 --> 15:23.160]  But if you duck down right now,
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.120]  you can see like 200 yards down the row.
[15:26.560 --> 15:28.120]  People just went 200 yards.
[15:28.120 --> 15:29.320]  How big is your grow room?
[15:29.320 --> 15:30.680]  You should see some of the shit we got.
[15:30.680 --> 15:33.080]  I always laugh when I read about big busts.
[15:33.080 --> 15:35.040]  I just saw one that the cops had online
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.440]  where it was literally eight one gram baggies of weed
[15:38.440 --> 15:40.600]  on the table and they were like busting another one
[15:40.600 --> 15:42.440]  going into whatever venue.
[15:42.440 --> 15:43.520]  And I was like, oh dude,
[15:43.520 --> 15:44.960]  I could just post some pictures from work
[15:44.960 --> 15:46.920]  where there's more Keefe than that on a tray
[15:46.920 --> 15:49.000]  that's about to get swept into the hash bag
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.480]  just because that's what we do with it here.
[15:52.480 --> 15:54.280]  What are you guys doing out there on the East Coast?
[15:54.280 --> 15:55.840]  Come on now, catch up.
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.440]  All right, Mike, you're going to get some hate mail coming.
[15:57.440 --> 15:58.280]  Let's bail you out.
[15:58.280 --> 16:01.400]  You're in the quick sand.
[16:01.400 --> 16:03.560]  So we're trying to get more air flow.
[16:03.560 --> 16:05.280]  We're trying to move that crap
[16:05.280 --> 16:06.680]  that the plants would grow on the bottom.
[16:06.680 --> 16:08.080]  We're just trying to basically cut that off
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.200]  and put that energy up the top
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.880]  so we can get those big fat juicy buds
[16:10.880 --> 16:12.360]  that we're looking for.
[16:12.360 --> 16:14.160]  You might want to spread that out with the trellis.
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.920]  Either way, I do recommend a bottoming
[16:15.920 --> 16:18.000]  and lollipopping and shaving the legs.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.080]  It makes the room look better.
[16:19.080 --> 16:20.240]  It makes it easier to water.
[16:20.240 --> 16:22.160]  It gets that, you don't want leaves hanging down
[16:22.160 --> 16:24.040]  on the pots and in the soil anyway.
[16:24.040 --> 16:25.720]  That just helps you out getting bugs.
[16:26.560 --> 16:28.440]  By cleaning up the inside, you help get air flow in there.
[16:28.440 --> 16:29.600]  That helps you prevent bud rot.
[16:29.600 --> 16:32.320]  It also helps move that energy out to the ends of the plants
[16:32.320 --> 16:34.480]  to get you bigger, fatter buds.
[16:34.480 --> 16:36.040]  It's a pretty simple technique.
[16:36.040 --> 16:38.120]  You just want to take off anything that you think,
[16:38.120 --> 16:40.920]  the branching, you have to be selective with the branching.
[16:40.920 --> 16:42.440]  Decide what branches you want to leave.
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.760]  You can always take more off later.
[16:43.760 --> 16:45.560]  If it doesn't look like it's going to be worth a shit,
[16:45.560 --> 16:46.400]  cut it off.
[16:46.400 --> 16:48.360]  You can do this, and we're going to talk about timing next.
[16:48.360 --> 16:49.560]  You can do this end of flower
[16:49.560 --> 16:51.560]  so you don't have to make your decision today.
[16:51.560 --> 16:54.280]  All those little suckers that are just little tiny shoots,
[16:54.280 --> 16:55.120]  take those off.
[16:55.520 --> 16:56.560]  They're not going to be worth a shit.
[16:56.560 --> 17:00.320]  Basically anything on the bottom third of the plant or so
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.160]  can be removed if it's going to be tiny.
[17:02.160 --> 17:03.360]  You don't want to go up high
[17:03.360 --> 17:04.680]  doing this kind of stuff on the plant.
[17:04.680 --> 17:05.520]  Then you'll stunt the growth.
[17:05.520 --> 17:07.280]  You'll start taking off potential bud sites,
[17:07.280 --> 17:08.560]  but the stuff on the bottom,
[17:08.560 --> 17:10.600]  feel free to go ahead and chop that off of there.
[17:10.600 --> 17:12.240]  Now you might want to start light the first time
[17:12.240 --> 17:14.160]  and work your way up, or like Mike said,
[17:14.160 --> 17:16.320]  maybe fuck one plant up on a level 10,
[17:16.320 --> 17:19.560]  fuck one up level seven, go a little lighter on each plant.
[17:19.560 --> 17:21.840]  Experiment, don't go hard on their first try.
[17:21.840 --> 17:23.480]  Go slow and learn.
[17:23.480 --> 17:25.040]  Now, if you are going to top your plants,
[17:25.840 --> 17:26.680]  a lot of people like to top.
[17:26.680 --> 17:27.520]  Here we go.
[17:27.520 --> 17:28.560]  Next episode will be about topping.
[17:28.560 --> 17:29.400]  Let's write that down.
[17:29.400 --> 17:30.240]  There we go.
[17:30.240 --> 17:31.080]  Topping.
[17:31.080 --> 17:31.920]  We're going to talk about topping the plants
[17:31.920 --> 17:33.680]  in the next episode, but top them first,
[17:33.680 --> 17:34.600]  because think about this.
[17:34.600 --> 17:36.320]  What if you bought them, you lollipop,
[17:36.320 --> 17:37.160]  and then you top them.
[17:37.160 --> 17:38.840]  Now you already kind of fucked up the height of your plant.
[17:38.840 --> 17:39.960]  You took off too much.
[17:41.200 --> 17:42.440]  So top them first.
[17:42.440 --> 17:44.240]  That is a good idea that we should mention now.
[17:44.240 --> 17:46.520]  Top them before you do bottom and lollipopping.
[17:46.520 --> 17:47.480]  Maybe put them in the trellis
[17:47.480 --> 17:49.880]  before you do the bottom and lollipopping.
[17:49.880 --> 17:52.640]  Now, this part is kind of up for a lot.
[17:52.640 --> 17:53.720]  Everything I'm talking about,
[17:53.720 --> 17:55.280]  people will have their own method and approach.
[17:55.280 --> 17:56.800]  People will say that they do it a different way.
[17:56.800 --> 17:57.760]  That is fine.
[17:57.760 --> 18:00.040]  This is the most debatable part of this,
[18:00.040 --> 18:03.200]  the when to do the bottoming, the lollipopping,
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.720]  and the shaving of the legs.
[18:05.600 --> 18:08.280]  You can do this just before flower,
[18:08.280 --> 18:12.320]  or you can do this all the way up to the start of week three,
[18:12.320 --> 18:14.400]  or you can start at the beginning of flower
[18:14.400 --> 18:17.800]  and continue all the way into the middle of week three.
[18:17.800 --> 18:20.160]  It just kind of depends on what you want to do.
[18:20.160 --> 18:22.040]  If you've taken some off and you realize,
[18:22.040 --> 18:23.520]  oh, those plants got much larger
[18:23.520 --> 18:24.800]  after they went into flower,
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.240]  and I can probably clean them up more,
[18:26.240 --> 18:27.480]  feel free, go for it.
[18:27.480 --> 18:28.960]  You can pull off the bottoms.
[18:28.960 --> 18:31.160]  You can clean that shit up all the way into week three
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.800]  without causing too much problems.
[18:32.800 --> 18:34.880]  If you need to take off a full branch at some point,
[18:34.880 --> 18:37.280]  you're not going to harm the plant just by whacking one off.
[18:37.280 --> 18:40.200]  I think if you're worried too about
[18:41.480 --> 18:43.080]  how the plant's going to react
[18:44.880 --> 18:46.840]  to your defoliation techniques,
[18:46.840 --> 18:48.120]  being in veg when you do it
[18:48.120 --> 18:49.800]  can be a little safer of a technique
[18:49.840 --> 18:52.240]  because you can give it more of a chance
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.080]  to bounce back from any damage you do,
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.360]  like if you're a first timer.
[18:55.360 --> 18:56.560]  For sure.
[18:56.560 --> 18:59.200]  And you're like, I'm not sure how much to take off.
[18:59.200 --> 19:02.120]  So if you're a little worried about that,
[19:02.120 --> 19:06.040]  just try to take off some of the lower stuff
[19:06.040 --> 19:07.920]  and kind of work your way in.
[19:07.920 --> 19:10.000]  With experience, you'll get more comfortable.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.680]  Yeah, you'll get an idea of what the shape you expect
[19:12.680 --> 19:14.480]  from your plant for your environment.
[19:14.480 --> 19:15.920]  And so you'll learn how to start shaping that.
[19:15.920 --> 19:18.240]  And then you can start kind of working back.
[19:18.280 --> 19:20.840]  Like I'm saying now to do this right before flower,
[19:20.840 --> 19:22.360]  once you get better at shaping the plant,
[19:22.360 --> 19:24.960]  you can do it earlier in veg and earlier in veg,
[19:24.960 --> 19:26.360]  and you can start shaping that plant
[19:26.360 --> 19:28.520]  exactly how you want it from early.
[19:28.520 --> 19:30.480]  And from the time you get a clone started,
[19:30.480 --> 19:31.640]  you can say, oh, I'm going to want
[19:31.640 --> 19:33.040]  these branches gone for sure.
[19:33.040 --> 19:35.200]  I'm going to want these branches here for sure.
[19:35.200 --> 19:36.600]  And then by removing a bunch of the shit
[19:36.600 --> 19:39.280]  from the bottom early on, you actually do the same idea.
[19:39.280 --> 19:41.560]  You send that up to the top in veg as well,
[19:41.560 --> 19:43.760]  because you're not wasting crap on that bottom.
[19:43.760 --> 19:45.760]  You're not wasting nutrients, energy,
[19:45.760 --> 19:47.560]  pesticides if you're spraying.
[19:47.600 --> 19:49.480]  You're not wasting all that crap on the bottom there.
[19:49.480 --> 19:51.080]  So go ahead and pull that stuff off,
[19:51.080 --> 19:53.160]  send some energy up to the top.
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.040]  You know what I'm talking about?
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.680]  That part down on the bottom part of the plant
[19:56.680 --> 19:58.680]  that just looks like a chia pet
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.840]  growing on your fucking weed plant.
[19:59.840 --> 20:00.680]  It's not worth anything.
[20:00.680 --> 20:02.080]  It's just a little foliage.
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.520]  That's where the spider mites want to hang out.
[20:03.520 --> 20:04.920]  That's where the powdery mildew wants to go.
[20:04.920 --> 20:07.040]  It's where the thrips want to be.
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.840]  The thing I hear people talking themselves
[20:08.840 --> 20:10.880]  into keeping it is they go, it's a hash material.
[20:10.880 --> 20:11.720]  It'll be hash material.
[20:11.720 --> 20:12.840]  It'll be hash material.
[20:12.840 --> 20:13.960]  There's going to be plenty of that.
[20:13.960 --> 20:15.000]  Just get rid of it.
[20:15.000 --> 20:15.840]  Yeah.
[20:15.840 --> 20:16.680]  Please just get,
[20:16.720 --> 20:18.640]  just be happy with yourself if you do it.
[20:18.640 --> 20:21.240]  Also, a lot of times if you have genetics
[20:21.240 --> 20:22.400]  that you aren't too sure about,
[20:22.400 --> 20:24.760]  taking off some of those can be a good idea as well
[20:24.760 --> 20:28.680]  because generally they like to herm towards the bottom.
[20:28.680 --> 20:29.520]  Towards the bottom.
[20:29.520 --> 20:31.280]  If you aren't sure if the genetics are going to be solid
[20:31.280 --> 20:34.320]  or not, you know, taking off some of those lower inners
[20:34.320 --> 20:36.760]  can kind of be a lifesaver for not pollinating
[20:36.760 --> 20:38.560]  out your entire flower room.
[20:38.560 --> 20:39.400]  Yeah.
[20:39.400 --> 20:40.240]  It'll show you,
[20:40.240 --> 20:41.520]  it'll show you, if it's going to be a herm,
[20:41.520 --> 20:42.720]  it'll show you that down lower
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.760]  where there's not a lot of light.
[20:43.760 --> 20:45.920]  That's where you see the herm parts for sure.
[20:45.920 --> 20:47.200]  Which it'll still like, you know,
[20:47.200 --> 20:48.680]  if it's going to herm, it's going to herm.
[20:48.680 --> 20:50.600]  But that might buy you some time.
[20:50.600 --> 20:51.480]  You might be able to see it
[20:51.480 --> 20:52.640]  if it's not down there in the middle.
[20:52.640 --> 20:53.600]  Yeah.
[20:53.600 --> 20:54.520]  Hell yeah.
[20:54.520 --> 20:55.880]  When I always laugh,
[20:55.880 --> 20:59.320]  the day after a big defoliation run was always,
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.480]  hey, I found six sprayer heads that are clogged.
[21:02.480 --> 21:03.840]  And it's, you can,
[21:03.840 --> 21:05.320]  you can see everything better.
[21:05.320 --> 21:07.560]  You can, you can get in and work your plant better.
[21:07.560 --> 21:09.480]  The plant gets more light on every piece
[21:09.480 --> 21:10.840]  that's growing better.
[21:10.840 --> 21:12.080]  You can see what you're doing better.
[21:12.080 --> 21:14.160]  You can see your equipment better.
[21:14.920 --> 21:16.640]  There's so many benefits to this.
[21:16.640 --> 21:17.480]  So many.
[21:17.480 --> 21:20.160]  And I've seen people do some really amazing things
[21:20.160 --> 21:21.440]  with the cannabis plant.
[21:22.520 --> 21:26.440]  With bottoming, topping, scrogging, lollipopping.
[21:26.440 --> 21:29.840]  And like I've seen it grow long and down a row
[21:29.840 --> 21:33.000]  where one plant grows halfway down a backyard,
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.360]  just every couple of feet,
[21:34.360 --> 21:36.560]  another branch goes up and it keeps moving forward.
[21:36.560 --> 21:38.400]  And it was just every summer
[21:38.400 --> 21:39.400]  or every day that summer,
[21:39.400 --> 21:40.960]  the grower went out there and grabbed the top
[21:40.960 --> 21:43.680]  and dunked it under the next rung of the fence.
[21:43.680 --> 21:44.800]  If you take your time,
[21:44.800 --> 21:47.160]  you can work this plant into any shape or mold
[21:47.160 --> 21:49.680]  you need to fit your grow space.
[21:49.680 --> 21:51.800]  You just need to take your time and practice.
[21:51.800 --> 21:52.640]  Yeah.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.360]  And it just goes back to knowing your space.
[21:54.360 --> 21:56.000]  Like you just said, you know,
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.040]  knowing what you're working with
[21:57.040 --> 21:59.360]  and what you're trying to accomplish in the end.
[21:59.360 --> 22:00.640]  You know, if you want a plant
[22:00.640 --> 22:02.920]  that's going to be really short and squatty and bushy,
[22:02.920 --> 22:04.840]  you can accomplish that even with a strain
[22:04.840 --> 22:07.400]  that isn't going to naturally want to do that
[22:07.400 --> 22:09.880]  just by, you know, training it properly.
[22:09.880 --> 22:11.240]  You can bend and pop.
[22:11.240 --> 22:13.520]  You can do all kinds of topping stuff we'll talk about.
[22:14.280 --> 22:15.120]  In the future.
[22:15.120 --> 22:15.960]  We've got popping and twisting
[22:15.960 --> 22:17.080]  in another episode coming up.
[22:17.080 --> 22:18.600]  So yeah, good, good hype.
[22:18.600 --> 22:19.480]  But yeah, you know,
[22:19.480 --> 22:21.000]  there's a lot of techniques you can do
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.360]  to really make this plant into anything you want.
[22:25.360 --> 22:27.240]  And when you've done a,
[22:27.240 --> 22:29.640]  run a strain a couple of grows in a row
[22:29.640 --> 22:32.360]  and really got a feel for how the plant grows,
[22:32.360 --> 22:36.320]  you can find ways to maximize that strain
[22:36.320 --> 22:38.520]  in your space with your method.
[22:38.520 --> 22:40.480]  And I mean, I've seen some growers
[22:40.480 --> 22:43.320]  do some really beautiful things with this stuff.
[22:44.000 --> 22:44.840]  So play with it.
[22:44.840 --> 22:45.680]  Play with it.
[22:45.680 --> 22:46.520]  Have fun with it.
[22:46.520 --> 22:47.360]  Make sure you're having fun.
[22:47.360 --> 22:48.200]  That's the most important part.
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.040]  And take notes.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.360]  And for new growers,
[22:50.360 --> 22:53.400]  a lot of people will successfully do this
[22:53.400 --> 22:55.040]  by setting up a string.
[22:55.040 --> 22:56.520]  So that way they can,
[22:56.520 --> 22:58.480]  across their kind of canopy area
[22:58.480 --> 23:00.920]  where they're going to lollipop to,
[23:00.920 --> 23:02.840]  and it gives you a more consistent
[23:02.840 --> 23:03.800]  all the way through your tent.
[23:03.800 --> 23:05.480]  You know, if you have like a trellis system,
[23:05.480 --> 23:07.480]  run one string across the bottom,
[23:07.480 --> 23:09.000]  all this stuff that's not getting light,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.440]  and that way take off everything below that.
[23:11.440 --> 23:14.280]  And it'll be more consistent that way too.
[23:14.280 --> 23:16.840]  And I think that's a good way for new people
[23:16.840 --> 23:17.760]  to kind of get an idea.
[23:17.760 --> 23:20.280]  Okay, this is gonna be what I need to take.
[23:20.280 --> 23:21.960]  That's the level I want to go to.
[23:21.960 --> 23:23.040]  Go up to here.
[23:23.040 --> 23:25.200]  Yeah, it's like drawing a chalk line.
[23:25.200 --> 23:26.400]  Perfect.
[23:26.400 --> 23:29.360]  So the main idea is to take off all that crop
[23:29.360 --> 23:32.960]  off the bottom, increase airflow, prevent problems.
[23:32.960 --> 23:35.080]  You want to do it basically about the bottom third.
[23:35.080 --> 23:37.840]  You can do it starting early or late in veg.
[23:37.840 --> 23:39.160]  You can continue to do so.
[23:39.160 --> 23:41.840]  I recommend a nice bottoming, lollipopping,
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.400]  and cleaning up kind of about the second week of flower.
[23:44.400 --> 23:46.340]  You can see where your little bud sites are gonna be.
[23:46.340 --> 23:48.600]  You can see which bud sites are going to be worth a shit
[23:48.600 --> 23:49.600]  and what's not.
[23:49.600 --> 23:50.880]  Go in there and just take off anything
[23:50.880 --> 23:53.400]  that you think is a waste of time, a waste of space.
[23:53.400 --> 23:55.360]  If it won't turn into a bud that is worth trimming,
[23:55.360 --> 23:57.120]  you probably don't want it on there.
[23:57.120 --> 23:58.880]  It depends on your goal, honestly.
[23:58.880 --> 24:00.700]  In most cases in a commercial environment,
[24:00.700 --> 24:03.640]  if it's not at least as big as my pinky or my thumb,
[24:03.640 --> 24:04.480]  we don't trim that.
[24:04.480 --> 24:05.820]  That becomes concentrate.
[24:05.820 --> 24:08.560]  So think about that when it comes to taking stuff off.
[24:09.320 --> 24:10.160]  Don't go too hard.
[24:10.160 --> 24:13.000]  You can't put shit back, but you can always take more off.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.400]  If you see that a branch just isn't performing,
[24:15.400 --> 24:16.440]  you've got those little branches
[24:16.440 --> 24:18.080]  that just stick up in the middle of the plant,
[24:18.080 --> 24:19.200]  feel free to take those off.
[24:19.200 --> 24:21.120]  You'll see that it increases airflow.
[24:21.120 --> 24:22.600]  The plants will just look happier.
[24:22.600 --> 24:25.280]  It just looks like a happier, cleaner canopy in there.
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.900]  And if that's not for you, don't do it.
[24:26.900 --> 24:28.600]  That's simply how it goes.
[24:28.600 --> 24:31.800]  Give it a defoliation first, clean up the bottoms.
[24:31.800 --> 24:34.040]  And then if you're gonna top, make sure you top first.
[24:34.040 --> 24:35.960]  Also, because you don't want a bottom
[24:35.960 --> 24:37.520]  and then expect to have another foot
[24:37.520 --> 24:38.920]  that you just cut off the plant.
[24:39.680 --> 24:40.640]  That'll throw you off.
[24:40.640 --> 24:41.600]  You guys got any more input
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.880]  before we start wrapping up this episode?
[24:42.880 --> 24:45.000]  I feel like we gave a pretty decent lesson
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.800]  on bottoming our cannabis plants.
[24:48.560 --> 24:51.680]  I think with strain dependent,
[24:51.680 --> 24:55.880]  I've also had strains where they golf ball out real hard
[24:55.880 --> 24:57.520]  and they stretch their arms in a way
[24:57.520 --> 24:59.440]  that you don't have to defoliate
[24:59.440 --> 25:01.200]  or take off as much of the lowers
[25:01.200 --> 25:03.840]  because they all just golf ball up
[25:03.840 --> 25:06.960]  into nice big dense nugs all the way through.
[25:06.960 --> 25:08.360]  Those strains are kind of rare
[25:08.880 --> 25:11.920]  and you don't come across ones
[25:11.920 --> 25:13.520]  that grow in that pattern often.
[25:13.520 --> 25:16.280]  Some ghost OG and ghost dog sort of stuff.
[25:16.280 --> 25:19.120]  Yeah, definitely try different techniques
[25:19.120 --> 25:20.400]  with whatever you're working with
[25:20.400 --> 25:22.200]  and get proficient in that
[25:22.200 --> 25:26.240]  because just the experience is gonna increase
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.640]  your overall growth knowledge.
[25:30.640 --> 25:33.560]  Happiness, experience, harvest, yield, potency,
[25:33.560 --> 25:34.680]  all of the above will increase.
[25:34.680 --> 25:35.520]  Yeah.
[25:35.520 --> 25:36.360]  Yeah, sorry there.
[25:36.360 --> 25:37.180]  No, you're stoned.
[25:37.180 --> 25:38.020]  We're all stoned too, don't worry.
[25:38.580 --> 25:39.420]  We'll bail us out.
[25:39.420 --> 25:43.820]  Symmetry and getting a good equal defoliation
[25:43.820 --> 25:45.380]  through your grow is huge.
[25:45.380 --> 25:48.220]  And it gets, I've seen this become a major problem
[25:48.220 --> 25:50.540]  and grows as small as like four lights.
[25:52.060 --> 25:55.300]  I mean, if you've got three or five gallon pots
[25:55.300 --> 25:56.900]  and the plants get to a decent size
[25:56.900 --> 25:57.860]  and you go to defoliate,
[25:57.860 --> 25:59.420]  I mean, you're talking about several hours of the work
[25:59.420 --> 26:01.660]  depending on the amount of lollipopping
[26:01.660 --> 26:02.500]  and whatnot you're doing.
[26:02.500 --> 26:07.300]  And the first plant gets a perfect, exactly what you want.
[26:07.300 --> 26:08.940]  The second plant gets about the same.
[26:08.940 --> 26:11.420]  The third plant gets 85%.
[26:11.420 --> 26:14.980]  The last plant gets like 25% of what you intended to do.
[26:14.980 --> 26:17.140]  And that causes all sorts of weird problems in your growth
[26:17.140 --> 26:19.780]  from airflow and light problems
[26:19.780 --> 26:22.700]  to a little pest concentrations
[26:22.700 --> 26:24.340]  and just try to make it even,
[26:24.340 --> 26:27.100]  even if that means giving the first plant in 80
[26:27.100 --> 26:29.660]  so that you can give all the plants in the room in 80.
[26:29.660 --> 26:31.060]  You know what I mean?
[26:31.060 --> 26:33.700]  And come back tomorrow and do the last 20.
[26:33.700 --> 26:35.940]  And I think another thing people miss
[26:35.980 --> 26:38.940]  is when you first transplant into like a one
[26:38.940 --> 26:40.580]  or three or five gallon,
[26:41.540 --> 26:44.820]  you're gonna have a lot of lower stuff on your plant.
[26:44.820 --> 26:47.500]  You can go ahead and take a lot of that lower stuff off
[26:47.500 --> 26:49.660]  in veg that's gonna touch the soil
[26:49.660 --> 26:51.740]  because that stuff's gonna,
[26:51.740 --> 26:53.740]  it's gonna be bad for your plant.
[26:53.740 --> 26:55.020]  There's a lot of things in your soil
[26:55.020 --> 26:57.660]  that you don't want getting systemic into your plant.
[26:58.540 --> 27:00.260]  So go ahead and take all that stuff off
[27:00.260 --> 27:02.620]  that it looks like it's gonna touch the soil
[27:02.620 --> 27:04.540]  or could potentially touch the soil.
[27:04.940 --> 27:06.620]  You know, early on,
[27:06.620 --> 27:10.580]  go ahead and start taking some of that lower foliage off.
[27:10.580 --> 27:11.420]  Yeah, I agree.
[27:11.420 --> 27:12.260]  Start cleaning it up.
[27:12.260 --> 27:13.100]  You'll start sending,
[27:13.100 --> 27:15.100]  then all that stuff that you're feeding to the plants
[27:15.100 --> 27:15.940]  has to go somewhere.
[27:15.940 --> 27:17.620]  And if you've got little straggler shoots and leaves
[27:17.620 --> 27:18.460]  that you don't need,
[27:18.460 --> 27:20.580]  you can use that energy in a better spot.
[27:20.580 --> 27:22.380]  Like I said earlier, it's like taking off your backpack
[27:22.380 --> 27:24.140]  or if you're taking off crap on the bottom,
[27:24.140 --> 27:26.100]  it's like taking off your shackles, your ankle weights,
[27:26.100 --> 27:28.020]  or maybe just a heavy anklet or something,
[27:28.020 --> 27:30.620]  maybe taking off those baggy Genco jeans that Mike wears,
[27:30.620 --> 27:32.460]  give him the ability to run a little faster.
[27:32.460 --> 27:33.540]  Can't run in these business.
[27:33.540 --> 27:34.580]  I'm sure you can't run in those,
[27:34.580 --> 27:35.900]  but can you run without,
[27:35.900 --> 27:37.740]  like if I gave you running shoes and shorts,
[27:37.740 --> 27:38.940]  are you still gonna run?
[27:38.940 --> 27:40.940]  I'm able, but usually unwilling.
[27:40.940 --> 27:41.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:41.860 --> 27:44.020]  We need four dogs and two cops if we need Mike to run.
[27:44.020 --> 27:45.220]  You need a cop with a dog?
[27:45.220 --> 27:46.060]  Yeah.
[27:46.060 --> 27:46.900]  Because if you're just a cop,
[27:46.900 --> 27:47.980]  I'm gonna talk my way out of it.
[27:47.980 --> 27:50.540]  But if you've got a dog, dog don't listen to me.
[27:50.540 --> 27:52.180]  Dog's just buddy.
[27:52.180 --> 27:55.020]  Also sucker branches,
[27:55.020 --> 27:58.140]  I call them on the bottoms that you'll have
[27:58.140 --> 27:59.700]  where you're almost tempted to keep them
[27:59.700 --> 28:01.460]  where they kind of go halfway up the plant
[28:01.460 --> 28:04.340]  and you're like, oh, it might do something.
[28:04.340 --> 28:06.100]  Just go ahead and get rid of that thing.
[28:06.100 --> 28:08.620]  It's not gonna, and even if it does stretch,
[28:08.620 --> 28:10.580]  you're just potentially taking away
[28:10.580 --> 28:12.820]  from all the other stuff that could have done way better.
[28:12.820 --> 28:15.100]  It's gonna need a stick or something to hold it up anyway.
[28:15.100 --> 28:16.420]  Don't waste your time with it.
[28:16.420 --> 28:17.260]  Yeah.
[28:17.260 --> 28:18.100]  And a lot of what we said,
[28:18.100 --> 28:20.940]  like we keep talking about is strain dependent.
[28:20.940 --> 28:22.460]  Some plants are gonna love this.
[28:22.460 --> 28:23.740]  Some plants won't need it.
[28:23.740 --> 28:25.180]  It's also environment dependent.
[28:25.180 --> 28:26.340]  If you've got a lot of light,
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.140]  you're going to produce more plant growth.
[28:28.140 --> 28:29.380]  You'll have more shoots.
[28:29.380 --> 28:31.940]  Also, you're going to have more canopy penetration.
[28:31.940 --> 28:33.380]  So you'll have to do the equation on there.
[28:33.380 --> 28:34.340]  Where do I take this off?
[28:34.340 --> 28:35.700]  How much do I take off?
[28:35.700 --> 28:36.940]  When do I stop?
[28:36.940 --> 28:38.220]  Keep in mind, I keep saying it,
[28:38.220 --> 28:39.660]  you can always cut more off.
[28:39.660 --> 28:42.060]  I don't have any plant glue.
[28:42.060 --> 28:44.420]  I don't know how to glue those branches back.
[28:44.420 --> 28:46.980]  No, you don't want to be messing with that.
[28:46.980 --> 28:49.740]  If you're trying to glue shit back onto your cannabis plant,
[28:49.740 --> 28:52.860]  you have gone into a sad and strange place.
[28:52.860 --> 28:54.340]  You know, some angry troll is gonna-
[28:54.340 --> 28:55.460]  It's time for a safety meeting.
[28:55.460 --> 28:57.020]  If you're trying to glue shit back on,
[28:57.020 --> 28:58.260]  it's time for a safety meeting.
[28:58.260 --> 29:00.140]  Some angry trollish fingers just blew up.
[29:00.140 --> 29:01.980]  Plant grafting, plant grafting.
[29:01.980 --> 29:03.660]  And it's like, yeah, you can do it with apple trees,
[29:03.660 --> 29:06.740]  but you don't want to do it with a 90 day harvesting plant.
[29:06.740 --> 29:09.500]  One of my favorite things to do is in a trim room,
[29:09.500 --> 29:11.380]  when right after I cut down a bunch of plants,
[29:11.380 --> 29:13.380]  like a whole room, a hundred plants,
[29:13.380 --> 29:16.020]  I take a couple out to the trimmers and I get them going.
[29:16.020 --> 29:16.980]  And then I'll get them trimming.
[29:16.980 --> 29:18.340]  I'll let them trim for an hour or so.
[29:18.340 --> 29:19.860]  And then, you know, I always go check on the trim crew.
[29:19.860 --> 29:21.300]  So I'll walk up and I'll pick a bud.
[29:21.300 --> 29:23.420]  It's like trimmed and I'll look at it and I'll look mad.
[29:23.420 --> 29:24.260]  And I'll go, what's wrong?
[29:24.260 --> 29:26.180]  Go, the plants aren't done, put them back.
[29:26.180 --> 29:27.020]  And they all give me this,
[29:27.020 --> 29:28.700]  what the fuck kind of a look.
[29:30.340 --> 29:31.180]  Oh man.
[29:31.180 --> 29:32.060]  I like to mess with trimmers.
[29:32.060 --> 29:32.900]  It's fun.
[29:32.900 --> 29:34.060]  And metric people also.
[29:34.060 --> 29:34.900]  Here's another fun one.
[29:34.900 --> 29:35.740]  If you work in the-
[29:35.740 --> 29:36.580]  Don't do this one.
[29:36.580 --> 29:37.400]  Oh, this is a good one.
[29:37.400 --> 29:38.240]  I love this one.
[29:38.240 --> 29:39.080]  It's not funny.
[29:39.080 --> 29:40.740]  If you work in the cannabis, regulated cannabis industry,
[29:40.740 --> 29:42.140]  and you've got plant tags that are required
[29:42.140 --> 29:43.260]  to be on your plants,
[29:43.260 --> 29:44.980]  walk out of a room with a lot of plants
[29:44.980 --> 29:46.500]  and find your compliance person
[29:46.500 --> 29:48.540]  or the person in charge of the tags and go,
[29:48.540 --> 29:51.020]  why don't any of the plants in that room have tags?
[29:51.020 --> 29:52.360]  And watch the look on their face
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.100]  because those plants must have tags.
[29:54.100 --> 29:56.020]  And if they don't have tags, they're going to get fired
[29:56.060 --> 29:57.500]  and we're going to get a lot of fines.
[29:57.500 --> 29:59.380]  And to watch them frantically piss their pants
[29:59.380 --> 30:02.260]  and try to figure out how to tag 300 plants right now,
[30:02.260 --> 30:04.220]  it's kind of a funny thing to play on people.
[30:04.220 --> 30:07.180]  I like walking into the dry room and going,
[30:07.180 --> 30:10.680]  so I guess we're not taking any fresh frozen this round, huh?
[30:10.680 --> 30:13.260]  And watching the trim manager freak the fuck out.
[30:13.260 --> 30:14.360]  Oh shit.
[30:15.460 --> 30:16.660]  That's an inside industry joke.
[30:16.660 --> 30:18.420]  That's fucking funny.
[30:18.420 --> 30:19.820]  It's always sublime in the trim room.
[30:19.820 --> 30:21.820]  Also, if you're wondering.
[30:21.820 --> 30:22.660]  All right.
[30:22.660 --> 30:23.500]  I feel like we had fun in this one.
[30:23.500 --> 30:25.420]  Mike, that look on your face, Mike, that's priceless.
[30:25.780 --> 30:26.780]  I feel like we had fun at the end of this episode.
[30:26.780 --> 30:27.740]  People got to learn stuff.
[30:27.740 --> 30:28.700]  I got to hang out with my bros.
[30:28.700 --> 30:30.020]  We got plenty stoned.
[30:31.060 --> 30:31.980]  We did indeed.
[30:31.980 --> 30:33.660]  I think it's time to start wrapping it up, dude.
[30:33.660 --> 30:34.500]  Yeah, man.
[30:34.500 --> 30:35.540]  Time to start wrapping it up.
[30:35.540 --> 30:36.580]  Had a great time.
[30:36.580 --> 30:37.580]  Mike, what does you got to say?
[30:37.580 --> 30:38.420]  You got something?
[30:38.420 --> 30:39.240]  I see it.
[30:39.240 --> 30:40.620]  Should we choose the next episode coming up?
[30:40.620 --> 30:41.660]  Oh.
[30:41.660 --> 30:43.660]  Well, how do you know it's coming up?
[30:43.660 --> 30:46.380]  Well, the numbers are sequential.
[30:46.380 --> 30:48.380]  You don't pick a random number.
[30:48.380 --> 30:49.580]  We're at 97 here.
[30:49.580 --> 30:50.660]  I know, we're getting close.
[30:50.660 --> 30:51.500]  We're getting close.
[30:51.500 --> 30:52.540]  We're getting close.
[30:52.540 --> 30:54.020]  We're getting close to 500.
[30:54.060 --> 30:55.620]  Number 500 is coming up.
[30:55.620 --> 30:58.340]  Trying to get all the crew, the gang, the gang gang,
[30:58.340 --> 30:59.460]  the boys, the Irie Army,
[30:59.460 --> 31:00.900]  the Grow From Your Heart squad over here.
[31:00.900 --> 31:03.020]  The boys together and mash through some hash.
[31:03.020 --> 31:04.180]  It's going to be like, yeah,
[31:04.180 --> 31:06.660]  it's going to be like getting the band back together, bro.
[31:06.660 --> 31:08.100]  But I have a pretty good idea of what should happen.
[31:08.100 --> 31:09.100]  It should be a good show.
[31:09.100 --> 31:10.460]  The big 500, man.
[31:10.460 --> 31:11.300]  The big 500.
[31:11.300 --> 31:12.300]  I look forward to it.
[31:12.300 --> 31:13.140]  Join us for 500.
[31:13.140 --> 31:13.980]  It's coming up.
[31:13.980 --> 31:15.140]  You guys, you can't get too hyped right now.
[31:15.140 --> 31:17.140]  I try not to get too hyped for the future coming up
[31:17.140 --> 31:18.220]  because, no, join us.
[31:18.220 --> 31:19.060]  We're going to be excited.
[31:19.060 --> 31:19.900]  It'll be a good time.
[31:19.900 --> 31:20.740]  Episode 500 is coming up.
[31:20.740 --> 31:21.580]  That one will come out the weekend
[31:21.620 --> 31:22.780]  and then we're at the Indo Expo.
[31:22.780 --> 31:23.620]  So.
[31:23.620 --> 31:25.060]  I was going to say, there's another big thing coming up.
[31:25.060 --> 31:25.900]  Yeah.
[31:25.900 --> 31:27.740]  The Indo Expo.
[31:27.740 --> 31:31.500]  So far, it looks like White Mike will be at the Indo Expo.
[31:31.500 --> 31:34.140]  It's looking like I'm going to be at the Indo Expo.
[31:34.140 --> 31:34.980]  I hope you make it, bro.
[31:34.980 --> 31:36.100]  Cause you're like my partner in crime.
[31:36.100 --> 31:36.980]  I hope I make it too.
[31:36.980 --> 31:37.820]  If I don't make it,
[31:37.820 --> 31:40.180]  I'm going to be like in the hospital or something.
[31:40.180 --> 31:41.460]  You will be.
[31:41.460 --> 31:42.300]  Yeah.
[31:42.300 --> 31:43.820]  Like either that's why I didn't make it.
[31:43.820 --> 31:45.740]  Or I ended up there when you got back on Monday
[31:45.740 --> 31:46.860]  and we were like, fucker.
[31:46.860 --> 31:47.700]  Yeah.
[31:47.700 --> 31:49.740]  The Indo Expo in Denver, Colorado at the Denver Mart
[31:49.740 --> 31:52.020]  on January 25th and 26th.
[31:52.020 --> 31:52.860]  Join us.
[31:52.860 --> 31:54.860]  The Saturday event is what they call
[31:54.860 --> 31:57.060]  industry insider day or something like that.
[31:57.060 --> 31:58.060]  You've got to be a business.
[31:58.060 --> 31:58.900]  You've got to have a business,
[31:58.900 --> 32:00.340]  something to get in on that day.
[32:00.340 --> 32:02.660]  On Sunday, it is open to the general public.
[32:02.660 --> 32:03.500]  It is general admission.
[32:03.500 --> 32:06.380]  However, you do need a ticket and also.
[32:06.380 --> 32:07.820]  Get your tickets now, people.
[32:07.820 --> 32:11.420]  Get your tickets early, but it may be a long wait in line.
[32:11.420 --> 32:14.420]  It is a crowded event and it is not easy to get in.
[32:14.420 --> 32:15.260]  Sometimes.
[32:15.260 --> 32:16.220]  Bring a coat and a water.
[32:16.220 --> 32:18.900]  Bring a coat, bring a water, get there early.
[32:18.900 --> 32:19.980]  It will be hard to park.
[32:19.980 --> 32:21.060]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[32:21.060 --> 32:22.860]  It is a cluster fuck of an event.
[32:22.860 --> 32:24.820]  Once you get in, it is a great time.
[32:24.820 --> 32:28.300]  I will be at booth number 533.
[32:28.300 --> 32:30.500]  White Mike will be there helping me out at the booth.
[32:30.500 --> 32:31.700]  Same booth number.
[32:31.700 --> 32:33.980]  Clint will be there part of the time.
[32:33.980 --> 32:34.820]  Different booth.
[32:34.820 --> 32:35.860]  Allegedly, no, same booth.
[32:35.860 --> 32:36.700]  He'll be there.
[32:36.700 --> 32:37.540]  He'll be there.
[32:37.540 --> 32:38.380]  He'll be there helping out.
[32:38.380 --> 32:39.260]  He's working security.
[32:39.260 --> 32:40.780]  Not really, he's just coming along.
[32:40.780 --> 32:42.780]  Double door Dank says he's going to show up
[32:42.780 --> 32:43.820]  at the Indo Expo.
[32:43.820 --> 32:44.660]  He's not part of the booth.
[32:44.660 --> 32:45.700]  I'm not excluding him.
[32:45.700 --> 32:47.580]  I just had a small staff to come work for me
[32:47.620 --> 32:48.980]  and it's Mike and Clint basically.
[32:48.980 --> 32:50.780]  We'll have double door up there hanging out.
[32:50.780 --> 32:53.260]  So if you guys want to come shake some hands, say hi.
[32:53.260 --> 32:54.260]  He will be at the booth.
[32:54.260 --> 32:55.220]  He'll come by sometime.
[32:55.220 --> 32:56.060]  I'm not exactly sure.
[32:56.060 --> 32:56.980]  He doesn't even know when yet.
[32:56.980 --> 32:58.140]  Probably Sunday.
[32:58.140 --> 32:58.980]  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[32:58.980 --> 33:00.180]  Come say what's up on that regular day.
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.740]  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[33:01.740 --> 33:03.980]  We are coming at you from the Indo Expo.
[33:03.980 --> 33:05.860]  Come by, come by the booth 533.
[33:05.860 --> 33:07.180]  Grab some iRegenetic seeds.
[33:07.180 --> 33:08.380]  I've got the menu finished up.
[33:08.380 --> 33:09.460]  I've got a lot of great shit with me.
[33:09.460 --> 33:11.100]  I'm dropping a couple of new things.
[33:11.100 --> 33:12.180]  One new thing at that event,
[33:12.180 --> 33:13.060]  I don't want to hype you up on two.
[33:13.060 --> 33:15.620]  There's one new thing that will be available at that event.
[33:15.620 --> 33:16.460]  Come get a selfie.
[33:16.460 --> 33:17.300]  Come shake my hand.
[33:17.300 --> 33:18.700]  Come meet White Mike.
[33:18.700 --> 33:19.860]  Mike doesn't go out a lot,
[33:19.860 --> 33:21.740]  so it's a good opportunity to come meet Mike,
[33:21.740 --> 33:23.780]  shake his hand, get a high five, maybe take a selfie.
[33:23.780 --> 33:25.100]  Rare opportunity.
[33:25.100 --> 33:26.340]  Rare opportunity.
[33:26.340 --> 33:27.500]  And early bird gets the worm.
[33:27.500 --> 33:29.620]  You know, there's a lot of good stuff
[33:29.620 --> 33:31.180]  Jeff's got planned for this.
[33:31.180 --> 33:33.100]  I highly recommend you get down there quick.
[33:33.100 --> 33:34.020]  You've seen the stash.
[33:34.020 --> 33:35.860]  Yeah, I know it's about to happen.
[33:35.860 --> 33:38.260]  So not to build up the hype too much,
[33:38.260 --> 33:40.180]  but you guys want to get to his booth quick.
[33:40.180 --> 33:42.940]  There are only 50 of some things available.
[33:42.940 --> 33:45.100]  So yeah, be one of the first 50.
[33:45.100 --> 33:46.580]  All right, limited runs.
[33:46.580 --> 33:47.420]  That's it.
[33:47.420 --> 33:49.060]  All right, that's enough hyping up the Indo Expo.
[33:49.060 --> 33:49.980]  The Expo.
[33:49.980 --> 33:51.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[33:51.180 --> 33:52.420]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[33:52.420 --> 33:54.300]  Yeah, the Indo Expo, Denver, Colorado.
[33:54.300 --> 33:55.180]  Did I say where it was?
[33:55.180 --> 33:56.580]  The Denver Mart.
[33:56.580 --> 33:58.040]  It's like near 58th and Washington.
[33:58.040 --> 33:59.220]  It's a great time.
[33:59.220 --> 34:00.140]  Get there early.
[34:00.140 --> 34:00.980]  Plan your shit now.
[34:00.980 --> 34:01.820]  Get a hotel room.
[34:01.820 --> 34:02.660]  Can't wait to see that.
[34:02.660 --> 34:03.780]  It's a non-consumption event.
[34:03.780 --> 34:05.540]  If you- Come early, bring cash.
[34:05.540 --> 34:06.940]  Oh, yeah, don't be like that about it,
[34:06.940 --> 34:08.820]  but be like that about it.
[34:08.820 --> 34:09.980]  It's a non-consumption event.
[34:09.980 --> 34:12.020]  We cannot consume cannabis there.
[34:12.020 --> 34:13.220]  You can show me your buds.
[34:13.220 --> 34:14.860]  If you've got buds to show me, I can take a look,
[34:14.860 --> 34:17.700]  but we can't smoke them there, so don't be disappointed.
[34:17.700 --> 34:19.820]  We can't take any dabs or anything like that.
[34:19.820 --> 34:21.420]  So please don't try to get me in trouble
[34:21.420 --> 34:22.420]  by offering me a dab.
[34:22.420 --> 34:23.540]  Don't come firing up your torch,
[34:23.540 --> 34:24.500]  because it's happened before.
[34:24.500 --> 34:25.780]  Then you feel like, oh, fuck, put that away.
[34:25.780 --> 34:26.720]  We're gonna get in trouble.
[34:26.720 --> 34:28.240]  But please don't do that to us.
[34:28.240 --> 34:29.420]  I'm high, I'm rambling.
[34:29.420 --> 34:30.380]  I'm also hungry.
[34:30.380 --> 34:32.020]  So let's start wrapping up this podcast.
[34:32.020 --> 34:33.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for hanging out

[34:40.920 --> 34:41.760]  It's a podcast, guys.

[34:43.480 --> 34:44.320]  Yeah.

[34:48.120 --> 34:48.960]  Yeah, they're waving now.
[34:48.960 --> 34:49.800]  It's a sign language podcast.
[34:49.800 --> 34:50.760]  It sounds like this.

[36:47.200 --> 36:48.320]  and be drastically different.
[36:48.320 --> 36:50.120]  My future is now past me.
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.120]  I feel helpless, yes, I'm real selfish suddenly.
[36:53.120 --> 36:55.120]  But I see gluttony kill Elvis
[36:55.120 --> 36:57.620]  And real wealth is determined by man's health
[36:57.620 --> 37:00.120]  So what's money if your friends are your damn self?
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.620]  And all the drugs can't help, they just make it worse
[37:02.620 --> 37:05.120]  Look at me, the other day I had to take a purse
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.620]  It's family first, fuck all of this shady shit
[37:07.620 --> 37:10.620]  I don't want a babysit, my lady shit can't make me quit
[37:10.620 --> 37:13.120]  It gets crazy and I'm totally cynical
[37:13.120 --> 37:15.620]  A bit lazy and I'm overly critical
[37:15.620 --> 37:17.620]  They used to make me go to the principal
[37:17.620 --> 37:20.620]  It was Dr. Wood that told me that my life was gonna be miserable
[37:20.620 --> 37:22.620]  But now I grow to residual income
[37:22.620 --> 37:25.620]  My principal is Bonds, I'm getting this shit done and we
[37:25.620 --> 37:27.620]  Doing work with minimal sleep
[37:27.620 --> 37:31.120]  Musical criminals keep stealing your beats and then we killing them
[37:31.120 --> 37:32.620]  Other MC's they put me to sleep
[37:32.620 --> 37:36.120]  It's like counting sheep, listening to them I'm not killing them
[37:36.120 --> 37:38.620]  And you can tell like William that I'm hung
[37:38.620 --> 37:41.620]  Got the ladies sprung with the tongue of a chameleon
[37:41.620 --> 37:43.620]  Hey Purdy, you confused? I can fill you in
[37:43.620 --> 37:46.620]  Hole of one to birdie, I play dirty but it's still a win
[37:46.620 --> 37:48.620]  I want a William before age 30
[37:48.620 --> 37:51.620]  Make a sturdy foundation for myself and my team
[37:51.620 --> 37:53.620]  I've been working like a motherfucker lately
[37:53.620 --> 37:56.620]  If that mother sucker's achy they just jealous and green, I mean
[37:56.620 --> 37:59.620]  Everybody's selling a dream, wolves in sheepskin
[37:59.620 --> 38:01.620]  They'll tell you that they're helping the scene
[38:01.620 --> 38:04.120]  But if your self esteem is low then they'll sink their teeth in
[38:04.120 --> 38:07.120]  If you fell for their schemes then your dreams is leaking
[38:07.120 --> 38:11.620]  Beat lover, I'm a beat beat lover and I need another beat to rhyme to
[38:11.620 --> 38:14.620]  Local MC's keep doing your thing
[38:14.620 --> 38:17.620]  Even if you ain't got a lot of peeps behind you
[38:17.620 --> 38:21.620]  Beat lover, I'm a beat beat lover and I need another beat to rhyme to
[38:21.620 --> 38:25.620]  I may never get the credit I deserve but at least I'll find peace of mind
[38:25.620 --> 38:27.620]  Peep the sign, I think I'm fine
[38:27.620 --> 38:29.620]  I'm getting tired of working
[38:29.620 --> 38:32.620]  And though it puts a strain on my soul it builds my pride as a person
[38:32.620 --> 38:35.120]  The rhyme is at the other side of that curtain
[38:35.120 --> 38:37.620]  I'm as unique as a modern day bride that's a virgin
[38:37.620 --> 38:39.620]  Writing these rhymes for your car speakers
[38:39.620 --> 38:43.120]  Everyday I stay putting my life on the line like a heart meter
[38:43.120 --> 38:45.620]  If the food's ripe it's wiped like a card reader
[38:45.620 --> 38:48.620]  But y'all think we shrinking caviar readers
[38:48.620 --> 38:50.620]  This is my life and living it's been fun though
[38:50.620 --> 38:53.620]  Front row gripping the mic letting the love flow
[38:53.620 --> 38:55.620]  I never worry about my lack of support
[38:55.620 --> 38:58.620]  So who are y'all? Some authority I have to report to
[38:58.620 --> 39:01.620]  And all my haters I don't have to ignore you but I do
[39:01.620 --> 39:03.620]  Sort of like the rappers I swore through
[39:03.620 --> 39:05.620]  But this year I'm a kick in the gear
[39:05.620 --> 39:09.120]  Gotta make my dream come quick like a chicken that clipped from brassieres
[39:09.120 --> 39:11.120]  Beer dripping hit the rig and we cheers
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.620]  We got them ear hitting rhymes bitches pick the opinions you motherfuckers
[39:14.620 --> 39:17.620]  You ain't never gonna pass this up even if you're gassing up
[39:17.620 --> 39:20.620]  You still come and laugh yourself, pass yourself
[39:20.620 --> 39:24.620]  I never had to face the fog, my enemies the center weed when it escapes the trunk
[39:24.620 --> 39:29.620]  Blazing skunk or run a dissap either way we gon' stay making love to the plant like
[39:29.620 --> 39:34.620]  Tree lover I'm a tree tree lover and I need another tree to roll up
[39:34.620 --> 39:37.620]  They said achieving my dreams wasn't hard as it seems
[39:37.620 --> 39:39.620]  So somebody tell me what's the hold up
[39:39.620 --> 39:44.620]  Tree lover I'm a tree tree lover and I need another tree to roll
[39:44.620 --> 39:47.620]  They said achieving my dreams wasn't hard as it seems
[39:47.620 --> 39:49.620]  Yet I can't even achieve my goals
[39:49.620 --> 39:50.620]  Yeah
[39:51.620 --> 39:53.620]  L Stubbs
[39:56.620 --> 39:58.620]  You wanna hear this shit brother?
[40:00.620 --> 40:02.620]  Let's get out of here man
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.620]  Oh wait we forgot to say peace
[40:09.620 --> 40:11.620]  Peace
