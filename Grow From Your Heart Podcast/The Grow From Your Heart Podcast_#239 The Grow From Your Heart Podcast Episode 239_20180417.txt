[00:14.910 --> 00:17.530]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.530 --> 00:19.410]  It's time for episode number 239
[00:19.410 --> 00:21.170]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:21.170 --> 00:25.050]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.050 --> 00:26.210]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.210 --> 00:27.510]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.510 --> 00:29.930]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.930 --> 00:31.210]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:31.210 --> 00:32.690]  or even someone who is just curious
[00:32.690 --> 00:34.570]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.570 --> 00:37.390]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.390 --> 00:39.210]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.210 --> 00:41.130]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.130 --> 00:43.410]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.410 --> 00:45.010]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.010 --> 00:47.450]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.450 --> 00:51.330]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.930 --> 00:57.830]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am high as giraffe pussy today.
[00:57.830 --> 00:59.890]  I just got done watching a Periscope video
[00:59.890 --> 01:01.290]  from Uncle Joey Diaz,
[01:01.290 --> 01:04.250]  and every time Joey took a bong hit, I took a dab.
[01:04.250 --> 01:06.850]  And let's just say I got wrecked.
[01:06.850 --> 01:09.410]  Woo, it's gonna be a fun podcast.
[01:09.410 --> 01:11.010]  Shout out to Uncle Joey Diaz.
[01:11.010 --> 01:11.930]  Speaking of Joey Diaz,
[01:11.930 --> 01:13.890]  I just bought tickets to see Uncle Joey
[01:13.890 --> 01:17.790]  at Comedy Works in February, and I am freaking excited.
[01:17.790 --> 01:18.950]  That's a good way to start the show.
[01:18.950 --> 01:19.930]  Let's just jump right into it.
[01:19.930 --> 01:20.770]  The last time we spoke,
[01:20.770 --> 01:23.030]  I was kind of bragging about getting to see
[01:23.030 --> 01:24.410]  Bert Kreischer at Comedy Works.
[01:24.410 --> 01:26.330]  So Sunday night, I took the lovely
[01:26.330 --> 01:28.170]  and always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth up to Denver,
[01:28.170 --> 01:31.450]  and we saw Bert Kreischer at Comedy Works.
[01:31.450 --> 01:32.290]  It was exciting.
[01:32.290 --> 01:34.050]  I haven't been that excited for a comedy show
[01:34.050 --> 01:34.890]  in a little while.
[01:34.890 --> 01:36.490]  Bert's been really popular lately.
[01:36.490 --> 01:37.730]  He's been really hyped up.
[01:37.730 --> 01:39.010]  He did not disappoint.
[01:39.010 --> 01:41.890]  Bert was hilarious, you guys.
[01:42.730 --> 01:43.570]  If you don't know who I'm talking about,
[01:43.570 --> 01:44.390]  Bert Kreischer is a comedian.
[01:44.390 --> 01:45.490]  He is known as The Machine.
[01:45.490 --> 01:47.730]  He does a bit about The Machine.
[01:47.730 --> 01:49.330]  I encourage you, as soon as you get done
[01:49.330 --> 01:51.250]  listening to my podcast, to go to YouTube
[01:51.250 --> 01:53.110]  and search Bert Kreischer, The Machine,
[01:53.110 --> 01:56.410]  and watch that story and laugh your ass off.
[01:56.410 --> 01:58.170]  So I saw Bert Kreischer at Comedy Works,
[01:58.170 --> 02:00.890]  and of course, everybody there treats me like a rock star.
[02:00.890 --> 02:01.830]  They treat me like royalty.
[02:01.830 --> 02:04.170]  Thanks for the royal treatment at Comedy Works.
[02:04.170 --> 02:07.190]  Bert came out and did about 40 minutes of material,
[02:07.190 --> 02:10.010]  and then after 40 minutes, he revealed to the crowd
[02:10.010 --> 02:12.970]  that he was recording his special that night,
[02:12.970 --> 02:14.930]  and he's going to edit down the recording,
[02:14.930 --> 02:16.930]  the show that he did, he's gonna edit that down,
[02:16.930 --> 02:20.650]  and that will be, he's hoping to sell the show to Netflix.
[02:20.650 --> 02:22.130]  He actually brought his own film crew.
[02:22.130 --> 02:23.810]  He paid for it all out of his pocket,
[02:23.810 --> 02:26.610]  and he recorded the entire show out of his pocket
[02:26.610 --> 02:28.250]  with his friends and his own crew.
[02:28.250 --> 02:30.530]  Nobody paid for it, and he's going to sell
[02:30.530 --> 02:31.570]  the special to Netflix.
[02:31.570 --> 02:33.650]  So hopefully, you guys will be able to watch
[02:33.650 --> 02:35.770]  this show on Netflix.
[02:35.770 --> 02:37.850]  It'll probably be like a year before that happens,
[02:37.850 --> 02:39.730]  honestly, with the way all the paperwork and shit happens
[02:40.470 --> 02:42.090]  and editing and all that, but eventually,
[02:42.090 --> 02:45.050]  you'll get to see that on Netflix.
[02:45.050 --> 02:46.890]  We knew something was going on because
[02:46.890 --> 02:47.730]  there was a camera there.
[02:47.730 --> 02:49.850]  There's a big camera, there were microphones and shit,
[02:49.850 --> 02:51.430]  which isn't odd for Comedy Works.
[02:51.430 --> 02:52.350]  That's kind of a regular thing,
[02:52.350 --> 02:54.490]  but there was a little more production than usual,
[02:54.490 --> 02:56.490]  but usually, if somebody's doing a special,
[02:56.490 --> 02:58.850]  I saw the taping of Joe Rogan's special
[02:58.850 --> 03:00.930]  at the same venue.
[03:00.930 --> 03:03.050]  Joe Rogan recorded his special, Rocky Mountain High,
[03:03.050 --> 03:05.010]  at Comedy Works, and I went to that,
[03:05.010 --> 03:06.450]  and it was really uptight.
[03:06.450 --> 03:08.570]  They had everybody taking off their hats.
[03:08.570 --> 03:10.290]  You couldn't wear shirts with logos.
[03:10.290 --> 03:13.530]  It was a really uptight, kind of intense experience,
[03:13.530 --> 03:15.730]  and the recording for Bert's show was just,
[03:15.730 --> 03:16.970]  hey, just a normal comedy show.
[03:16.970 --> 03:19.130]  Come on in and get rowdy, and so that was really cool.
[03:19.130 --> 03:22.410]  It was way better, way smoother, way less stressful.
[03:22.410 --> 03:23.810]  You were able to enjoy the show more.
[03:23.810 --> 03:24.810]  It was a little better.
[03:24.810 --> 03:26.130]  So yeah, he recorded a special.
[03:26.130 --> 03:27.450]  You guys will be able to see it.
[03:27.450 --> 03:28.930]  He did about 40 minutes of material.
[03:28.930 --> 03:30.210]  Then he announced that he was doing
[03:30.210 --> 03:31.570]  the special and recording.
[03:31.570 --> 03:32.770]  Then he looked at a notebook, and he's like,
[03:32.770 --> 03:34.370]  shit, I gotta do these couple of bits,
[03:34.370 --> 03:36.010]  because he had to get all his material in.
[03:36.010 --> 03:38.330]  So he did a couple of bits, and then he like,
[03:39.090 --> 03:40.730]  kind of freestyled for a few minutes, it felt like.
[03:40.730 --> 03:42.930]  Then he said, all right, you guys fucking ready?
[03:42.930 --> 03:44.510]  And he did the machine story.
[03:45.610 --> 03:46.890]  And honestly, he felt like he was
[03:46.890 --> 03:47.930]  rushing through the machine story.
[03:47.930 --> 03:50.170]  Everything else was fucking hilarious.
[03:50.170 --> 03:51.730]  I laughed so hard, I thought I was gonna
[03:51.730 --> 03:52.990]  poop myself once or twice.
[03:52.990 --> 03:54.050]  I thought I was gonna pee myself.
[03:54.050 --> 03:54.950]  My cheeks were hurting.
[03:54.950 --> 03:56.210]  My stomach was hurting.
[03:56.210 --> 03:59.090]  After so much laughter, your head will start to hurt.
[03:59.090 --> 04:00.650]  I had laughed my ass off.
[04:00.650 --> 04:02.290]  So by the time he got to the machine story,
[04:02.290 --> 04:04.650]  I think he saw the waitresses dropping checks.
[04:04.650 --> 04:07.250]  He knew it was time to speed it up, so he's speeding up.
[04:07.250 --> 04:08.290]  He crushed it.
[04:09.130 --> 04:11.370]  Some of my favorite parts, he was telling,
[04:11.370 --> 04:12.970]  he would be telling stories and telling jokes
[04:12.970 --> 04:14.570]  that I've heard, and then he would just have
[04:14.570 --> 04:18.490]  random sidebars and just go off on a random sidebar.
[04:18.490 --> 04:21.930]  He was telling a story about having to go to a,
[04:21.930 --> 04:23.850]  and I'm not gonna do the joke any justice.
[04:23.850 --> 04:27.130]  He had to go to a meeting at school for one of his students,
[04:27.130 --> 04:29.690]  and he woke up and he thought he grabbed two Diet Cokes
[04:29.690 --> 04:32.770]  and put them in his hoodie pocket and went to the school.
[04:32.770 --> 04:34.690]  He was in the meeting and he reached in his hoodie pocket
[04:34.690 --> 04:36.370]  and he pulled one out, cracked it open,
[04:36.370 --> 04:38.610]  took a slam of it and realized it's a Coors Light,
[04:38.610 --> 04:39.690]  not a Diet Coke.
[04:39.690 --> 04:41.370]  So that's the kind of stories that this man tells
[04:41.370 --> 04:42.430]  at his comedy show.
[04:42.430 --> 04:43.730]  It was fucking hilarious.
[04:43.730 --> 04:44.810]  Big shout out to Bert Kreischer.
[04:44.810 --> 04:48.610]  Also, I got to see a comedian by the name of Frank Castillo.
[04:48.610 --> 04:50.930]  If you know anything about the roast battles,
[04:50.930 --> 04:53.990]  Frank Castillo was the winner of the roast battle.
[04:53.990 --> 04:55.330]  The dude is hilarious.
[04:55.330 --> 04:57.090]  The guy told some great jokes.
[04:57.090 --> 04:59.170]  I have some friends that work at Comedy Works,
[04:59.170 --> 05:00.750]  and I'm kind of a regular at Comedy Works.
[05:00.750 --> 05:02.150]  People know me there.
[05:02.150 --> 05:03.490]  I texted my friend.
[05:03.490 --> 05:04.710]  I said, hey, I'm here, bro.
[05:04.710 --> 05:05.550]  How are you doing?
[05:05.550 --> 05:06.470]  He said, you know what?
[05:06.470 --> 05:08.830]  And he ran outside and he goes, dude,
[05:08.830 --> 05:11.090]  there are several comedians upstairs or downstairs
[05:11.090 --> 05:13.390]  that went to the dispensary and nobody's got a pipe.
[05:13.390 --> 05:14.390]  And I was like, well, here you go.
[05:14.390 --> 05:16.270]  I just happen to have a pipe in my pocket.
[05:16.270 --> 05:20.430]  So a bunch of high level comedians borrowed my pipe
[05:20.430 --> 05:21.330]  and got super stoned.
[05:21.330 --> 05:22.870]  And then at the end of the show,
[05:22.870 --> 05:25.630]  Frank Castillo made sure that I got my pipe back.
[05:25.630 --> 05:27.870]  When he saw me, he's like, tall white guy dreadlocks,
[05:27.870 --> 05:29.750]  this pipe must belong to you.
[05:29.750 --> 05:32.550]  And he made sure that I got my smoking apparatus back.
[05:32.550 --> 05:33.690]  Everybody was super kind to me.
[05:33.690 --> 05:36.810]  So I have a huge shout out to Mr. Bert fucking Kreischer,
[05:36.810 --> 05:39.990]  the machine, Frank Castillo, Comedy Works,
[05:39.990 --> 05:42.010]  and my buddy Baker.
[05:42.010 --> 05:43.330]  There was also an opening act.
[05:43.330 --> 05:44.170]  His name was Elliot.
[05:44.170 --> 05:45.810]  I did not catch his last name.
[05:45.810 --> 05:47.330]  Every time an opening act says their name,
[05:47.330 --> 05:49.170]  they say it like, my name is Elliot, blah, blah, blah.
[05:49.170 --> 05:49.990]  And it was good to see you.
[05:49.990 --> 05:51.870]  And you'd never catch their fucking full name.
[05:51.870 --> 05:53.330]  So I don't know what his last name was.
[05:53.330 --> 05:54.890]  He was hilarious.
[05:54.890 --> 05:56.690]  Somebody said he looked like a young John Elway
[05:56.690 --> 05:58.390]  and he took offense to it.
[05:58.390 --> 06:00.930]  Sorry, dude, that shit was accurate.
[06:01.890 --> 06:03.770]  Another funny part on the show,
[06:03.770 --> 06:05.030]  Bert Kreischer was talking about
[06:05.030 --> 06:06.730]  trying to keep his daughters innocent.
[06:06.730 --> 06:08.130]  And he believes that once a daughter
[06:08.130 --> 06:09.490]  does not believe in Santa Claus,
[06:09.490 --> 06:12.450]  is about the same time when she starts sucking a dick.
[06:12.450 --> 06:15.210]  So I had the lovely, always lovely, always beautiful
[06:15.210 --> 06:17.610]  Miss Jenny Beth on my arm, sitting right next to me.
[06:17.610 --> 06:19.330]  And we're a front row, of course, at Comedy Works
[06:19.330 --> 06:21.170]  because we do have the VIP love there.
[06:21.170 --> 06:22.810]  And Bert Kreischer looked at Jenny and said,
[06:22.810 --> 06:23.890]  do you ever suck a dick?
[06:23.890 --> 06:26.130]  And she of course nodded her head, yes.
[06:26.130 --> 06:28.090]  And Bert replied with, you believe in Santa?
[06:28.090 --> 06:29.450]  And she of course nodded her head, no.
[06:29.450 --> 06:31.130]  And Bert said, case in point.
[06:31.130 --> 06:31.970]  So I thought it was pretty funny
[06:31.970 --> 06:34.410]  that Jenny got to be the example.
[06:34.410 --> 06:36.450]  I thought it was extra funny that she was the example
[06:36.450 --> 06:38.810]  of sucking dick and not believing in Santa.
[06:38.810 --> 06:40.210]  All right, let's move forward before I get myself
[06:40.210 --> 06:42.610]  into any trouble with this conversation.
[06:42.610 --> 06:45.250]  Let's talk about what else went on lately?
[06:45.250 --> 06:46.250]  There was a big fight.
[06:46.250 --> 06:48.450]  Did anybody hear about this fight, a boxing match?
[06:48.450 --> 06:49.290]  I watched it.
[06:49.290 --> 06:50.250]  I did not pay to watch it.
[06:50.250 --> 06:52.410]  I wouldn't pay to watch that.
[06:52.410 --> 06:54.290]  I only watched it because of the hype and I was curious.
[06:54.290 --> 06:55.970]  I didn't want to feel left out.
[06:55.970 --> 06:57.770]  I had made predictions.
[06:57.810 --> 07:00.250]  I predicted, everybody can say they've made predictions,
[07:00.250 --> 07:01.210]  right, because it already happened.
[07:01.210 --> 07:02.530]  I could say, I said that was going to happen.
[07:02.530 --> 07:04.290]  No, I predicted that if it went further
[07:04.290 --> 07:06.170]  than four or five rounds, that Conor would get tired
[07:06.170 --> 07:08.210]  and put his hands down and get punched in the head.
[07:08.210 --> 07:09.290]  And that's basically what happened.
[07:09.290 --> 07:10.370]  I'm not trying to say I was psychic.
[07:10.370 --> 07:11.570]  It was just, that was the,
[07:11.570 --> 07:13.090]  never seen that dude go for very long.
[07:13.090 --> 07:15.050]  And I've seen the other dude go for a long fucking time.
[07:15.050 --> 07:16.930]  So I knew he'd wear him out.
[07:16.930 --> 07:18.370]  I thought he might be dangerous if he hit him.
[07:18.370 --> 07:20.330]  If McGregor would have hit him, it might've hurt him.
[07:20.330 --> 07:21.490]  It didn't do shit to him though.
[07:21.490 --> 07:23.050]  So hope you guys enjoyed the fight.
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.770]  I hope somebody won a bunch of fucking money out there.
[07:24.770 --> 07:26.330]  I know a lot of people were gambling on it.
[07:27.810 --> 07:31.810]  And it took home a big fat paycheck on that fight.
[07:31.810 --> 07:34.130]  It was overhyped in my opinion, overhyped.
[07:34.130 --> 07:34.970]  I was not impressed.
[07:34.970 --> 07:36.410]  I'm glad I didn't pay money to watch it.
[07:36.410 --> 07:38.050]  I'm glad I didn't go anywhere to watch it.
[07:38.050 --> 07:41.650]  I've got a friend who broadcasted it on Periscope Live.
[07:41.650 --> 07:44.050]  Shout out to D's Hideaway.
[07:44.050 --> 07:45.250]  Thanks for sharing that with me, bro.
[07:45.250 --> 07:46.410]  Appreciate it.
[07:46.410 --> 07:49.890]  All right, let's talk about some cannabis related stuff.
[07:49.890 --> 07:52.010]  I've got a message on my phone here.
[07:52.010 --> 07:53.330]  This one came to me on Instagram.
[07:53.330 --> 07:55.490]  You guys, I will answer your messages
[07:55.490 --> 07:57.830]  on just about any platform you send them.
[07:57.830 --> 07:59.650]  But I would prefer that you reach me
[07:59.650 --> 08:02.250]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:02.250 --> 08:03.750]  That's the easiest way to do it.
[08:03.750 --> 08:05.610]  This listener reached out to me on Instagram.
[08:05.610 --> 08:06.490]  I took a screenshot.
[08:06.490 --> 08:08.370]  I've got it here on my phone.
[08:08.370 --> 08:09.570]  Excuse the coughing.
[08:09.570 --> 08:12.770]  The message goes just like this.
[08:12.770 --> 08:13.850]  Hey, what's up, Rasta Jeff.
[08:13.850 --> 08:15.170]  I really enjoy your podcast.
[08:15.170 --> 08:16.770]  I can't say enough great things about it.
[08:16.770 --> 08:19.890]  Thank you for all the awesome, clear, comprehensive info.
[08:19.890 --> 08:21.770]  I do have a question about flushing.
[08:21.770 --> 08:23.330]  So far, you're off to a great start.
[08:23.330 --> 08:24.170]  What's up, man?
[08:24.170 --> 08:25.450]  Great to meet you.
[08:26.290 --> 08:27.130]  Thanks for enjoying my podcast.
[08:27.130 --> 08:28.170]  Thank you for listening.
[08:28.170 --> 08:30.210]  And not having enough great things to say about it.
[08:30.210 --> 08:31.250]  Just keep saying great stuff, man.
[08:31.250 --> 08:32.430]  We will be all right.
[08:32.430 --> 08:35.010]  And I try to make the info clear and comprehensive,
[08:35.010 --> 08:36.150]  and I'm glad you find it awesome.
[08:36.150 --> 08:36.990]  So thank you.
[08:36.990 --> 08:38.170]  I appreciate the compliments,
[08:38.170 --> 08:40.650]  and I'm happy to answer your question about flushing.
[08:40.650 --> 08:41.650]  It goes like this.
[08:41.650 --> 08:43.450]  I've listened to your flush and cure episodes
[08:43.450 --> 08:45.350]  multiple times, high and low.
[08:45.350 --> 08:47.250]  Maybe I'm looking too far into this.
[08:47.250 --> 08:49.050]  I'm using three gallon pots.
[08:49.050 --> 08:51.090]  You say to run three times fresh water
[08:51.090 --> 08:52.250]  the size of the pot,
[08:52.250 --> 08:54.130]  which would be nine gallons in my setup.
[08:54.130 --> 08:56.890]  Question is, should I be running nine gallons
[08:56.890 --> 09:00.730]  of water total, or nine gallons on my biweekly water?
[09:00.730 --> 09:01.570]  And then he continues with,
[09:01.570 --> 09:04.650]  I'm running Fox Farm Ocean Forest soil.
[09:04.650 --> 09:06.690]  So let's talk for a second about flushing
[09:06.690 --> 09:10.410]  and why we want to flush and what flushing does.
[09:10.410 --> 09:13.490]  The point of flushing is to remove excess nutrients
[09:13.490 --> 09:15.070]  from the buds, from the plants,
[09:15.070 --> 09:16.430]  so that when you cut them down,
[09:16.430 --> 09:18.330]  the plants don't taste like shit,
[09:18.330 --> 09:20.050]  they don't burn like shit.
[09:20.050 --> 09:22.650]  You just wanna move the mobile nutrients out of the plant.
[09:22.650 --> 09:24.890]  It's gonna make the plants burn much more smoothly.
[09:24.890 --> 09:26.250]  It's gonna make them taste better.
[09:26.250 --> 09:27.330]  It's gonna make them more appealing.
[09:27.330 --> 09:28.810]  They will smell better.
[09:28.810 --> 09:30.170]  If you've ever tried to roll a joint
[09:30.170 --> 09:31.450]  and you lit a joint and smoked it
[09:31.450 --> 09:32.450]  and it wouldn't burn right,
[09:32.450 --> 09:34.430]  or the ashes got black and chunky
[09:34.430 --> 09:35.810]  and became little coals,
[09:35.810 --> 09:38.270]  that herb was probably not properly flushed.
[09:38.270 --> 09:40.130]  It could have been flushed a little longer
[09:40.130 --> 09:41.810]  or a little more heavily.
[09:41.810 --> 09:44.930]  Now what flushing will do is you wanna pour enough water
[09:44.930 --> 09:47.490]  through your soil to clean out the nutrients
[09:47.490 --> 09:48.410]  that are in that soil.
[09:48.410 --> 09:50.170]  You wanna get rid of all the nitrogen,
[09:50.170 --> 09:52.690]  phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium.
[09:52.690 --> 09:55.570]  There are 16 elements in there that you need to wash out.
[09:55.570 --> 09:57.850]  You don't want that shit left in your plants.
[09:57.850 --> 09:59.850]  So the idea is to rinse the soil enough
[09:59.850 --> 10:01.650]  to where that is not left in there,
[10:01.650 --> 10:02.990]  and then at the same time,
[10:02.990 --> 10:06.490]  you need to give the plant plenty of time to metabolize,
[10:06.490 --> 10:08.330]  which you want it to drink up that water
[10:08.330 --> 10:10.930]  and metabolize all the nutrients that are left in there.
[10:10.930 --> 10:13.570]  So you'll start seeing the leaves turn golden yellow.
[10:13.570 --> 10:15.490]  That's telling you I'm running out of nitrogen.
[10:15.490 --> 10:17.330]  You'll start seeing things start going purple
[10:17.330 --> 10:19.570]  and silver colors and red and oranges.
[10:19.570 --> 10:21.290]  That's telling you that all those nutrients
[10:21.290 --> 10:23.090]  are being sucked out of the leaves
[10:23.090 --> 10:26.490]  and the plants are now ready to harvest.
[10:26.490 --> 10:28.970]  Now ideally, with most soil applications,
[10:28.970 --> 10:31.490]  you're gonna wanna give your plants 10 to 14,
[10:31.490 --> 10:33.810]  maybe even 20 days of flush time,
[10:33.810 --> 10:35.910]  depending on how heavily you've been feeding them
[10:35.910 --> 10:37.770]  and what is left in your soil.
[10:37.770 --> 10:40.250]  If you're using cocoa or hydroponic mediums,
[10:40.250 --> 10:42.230]  you can go much less time.
[10:42.230 --> 10:43.810]  Sometimes seven days is enough.
[10:43.810 --> 10:45.410]  10 days is usually plenty.
[10:45.410 --> 10:46.690]  If you're in cocoa,
[10:46.690 --> 10:48.570]  you will really see the plants flush out quickly.
[10:48.570 --> 10:50.530]  If you're in cocoa and you start feeding it
[10:50.530 --> 10:53.450]  just pH water, pH to like six, four, six, five,
[10:53.450 --> 10:55.690]  after three or four or four or five feedings of that,
[10:55.690 --> 10:57.690]  you will see the plant start reacting and telling you,
[10:57.690 --> 10:58.970]  hey, I'm out of nutrients.
[10:58.970 --> 11:00.270]  What the fuck is going on?
[11:00.270 --> 11:02.090]  Because cocoa doesn't hold much nutrient.
[11:02.090 --> 11:03.970]  Either it is rock wool.
[11:03.970 --> 11:05.570]  Now you guys that are using a super soil
[11:05.570 --> 11:07.010]  or a living soil or no-till,
[11:07.010 --> 11:08.450]  this does not apply to you
[11:08.450 --> 11:10.290]  because the organic stuff that you're putting in there,
[11:10.290 --> 11:12.890]  the plant is only gonna take up what it wants
[11:12.890 --> 11:15.350]  and it's not going to have unnecessary stuff in there.
[11:15.350 --> 11:17.850]  And like Subcool says, you've been flushing the whole time.
[11:17.850 --> 11:20.230]  If you're feeding your plants super soil,
[11:20.230 --> 11:22.050]  you mixed up a batch of super soil,
[11:22.050 --> 11:23.690]  you put the plant in there when it was little
[11:23.690 --> 11:25.650]  and it has been eating all of those nutrients
[11:25.650 --> 11:26.490]  the entire time
[11:26.490 --> 11:27.810]  and it has converted those nutrients
[11:27.810 --> 11:30.330]  into big healthy plants, big healthy stocks,
[11:30.330 --> 11:33.210]  big fat juicy resinous trichome laden buds
[11:33.210 --> 11:35.850]  that smell like fucking candy and amazingness.
[11:35.850 --> 11:37.810]  So all of those nutrients and amendments
[11:37.810 --> 11:39.370]  have probably been eaten up.
[11:39.370 --> 11:42.450]  You can probably tell by the way the plant's acting.
[11:42.450 --> 11:43.930]  If you put too much nutrient in there
[11:43.930 --> 11:45.930]  when you mixed it up and made the soil too rich,
[11:45.930 --> 11:47.290]  you either burn the plant early
[11:47.730 --> 11:48.930]  or it's gonna take a little too long
[11:48.930 --> 11:50.050]  to eat up all those nutrients.
[11:50.050 --> 11:52.130]  You're gonna have to run a little extra water through it.
[11:52.130 --> 11:54.530]  But most of you guys doing the super soil,
[11:54.530 --> 11:56.410]  the living soils, the no till shit,
[11:56.410 --> 11:58.690]  there's no need for you to flush.
[11:58.690 --> 12:00.290]  Now let's get kind of more to the point
[12:00.290 --> 12:01.730]  of this listener's question.
[12:01.730 --> 12:04.210]  He wants to know, since I'm using a three gallon pot
[12:04.210 --> 12:06.490]  and you recommended that I use three times
[12:06.490 --> 12:07.370]  the amount of water,
[12:07.370 --> 12:10.050]  do I need to run nine gallons of water through this pot
[12:10.050 --> 12:11.330]  to consider it flushed?
[12:12.370 --> 12:13.950]  I feel like running nine gallons of water
[12:13.950 --> 12:15.090]  through your three gallon pot
[12:15.090 --> 12:18.330]  is going to flood your plants and drown them
[12:18.330 --> 12:20.450]  and make them droopy and make them look like shit
[12:20.450 --> 12:22.250]  and really make them angry.
[12:22.250 --> 12:23.890]  Especially if you're using a plastic pot.
[12:23.890 --> 12:25.650]  If you've got air pots or net pots,
[12:25.650 --> 12:26.490]  that may work for you.
[12:26.490 --> 12:28.130]  But if you're using a plastic pot,
[12:28.130 --> 12:29.610]  that's definitely gonna drown your plants.
[12:29.610 --> 12:31.370]  And also you're gonna have a lot of runoff
[12:31.370 --> 12:33.650]  if you do that that you're going to have to deal with.
[12:33.650 --> 12:36.690]  My advice would be to run pH water,
[12:36.690 --> 12:38.690]  pH balanced about six four,
[12:38.690 --> 12:40.810]  adjusted pH to about six four,
[12:40.810 --> 12:42.650]  run enough of that through the plant
[12:42.650 --> 12:45.010]  until it's really running out of the bottom.
[12:45.890 --> 12:47.530]  If you wanna see water coming out of the bottom of the pot,
[12:47.530 --> 12:50.290]  maybe pour it until like half a gallon comes out
[12:50.290 --> 12:52.530]  or pour and then wait because it's gonna take a minute.
[12:52.530 --> 12:53.650]  Pour a gallon of water in there,
[12:53.650 --> 12:55.690]  wait a little bit, see how much comes out.
[12:55.690 --> 12:57.930]  If you don't get a half a gallon of water out of the bottom,
[12:57.930 --> 12:59.610]  pour a little bit more and wait until you've got
[12:59.610 --> 13:02.010]  about a half a gallon out of the bottom of the plant.
[13:02.010 --> 13:04.210]  They should be really saturated at that time
[13:04.210 --> 13:05.810]  and they shouldn't be over watered
[13:05.810 --> 13:08.750]  and then you wanna let them dry almost completely.
[13:08.750 --> 13:10.450]  Let them get to where they're like,
[13:10.450 --> 13:12.690]  oh, they're kind of looking like they need water.
[13:12.690 --> 13:14.210]  Give them water at that point
[13:14.210 --> 13:16.570]  and soak them up again until they start running off
[13:16.570 --> 13:18.970]  and do this over the next 14 days
[13:18.970 --> 13:20.090]  and you'll probably be able to get
[13:20.090 --> 13:21.330]  nine gallons of water through there.
[13:21.330 --> 13:23.970]  If you do one and a half gallons of water,
[13:23.970 --> 13:25.890]  that's gonna be four or five times.
[13:25.890 --> 13:28.290]  That should work out if you're watering every three days,
[13:28.290 --> 13:30.410]  that should work out just about right.
[13:30.410 --> 13:32.450]  You know, I do remember having the theory
[13:32.450 --> 13:34.530]  that you should run three times the amount of water
[13:34.530 --> 13:36.330]  through your pot but now that we're talking about it,
[13:36.330 --> 13:37.490]  that seems a little excessive
[13:37.490 --> 13:38.730]  and maybe I'm gonna change my mind.
[13:38.730 --> 13:40.130]  Maybe you just need double.
[13:40.250 --> 13:42.770]  If you haven't been fertilizing super heavily
[13:42.770 --> 13:44.330]  and you're taking care of your plants,
[13:44.330 --> 13:46.810]  I think two times the amount of water,
[13:46.810 --> 13:47.970]  six gallons should do you.
[13:47.970 --> 13:49.290]  So let's think about this.
[13:49.290 --> 13:51.050]  You'll water on the first time,
[13:51.050 --> 13:52.970]  you're gonna do a gallon and a half of water-ish,
[13:52.970 --> 13:53.850]  so that's one.
[13:53.850 --> 13:55.770]  Then the second time, you'll do another gallon and a half,
[13:55.770 --> 13:57.850]  that's two or that makes three
[13:57.850 --> 13:59.130]  and then if you do that two more times,
[13:59.130 --> 14:01.970]  it gives you six gallons and over 14 days,
[14:01.970 --> 14:05.370]  you should be able to get four solid waterings in there.
[14:05.370 --> 14:06.790]  So that should make sense.
[14:06.790 --> 14:08.290]  Now, the main thing,
[14:08.290 --> 14:10.830]  you don't have to go by a certain amount of water.
[14:10.830 --> 14:15.830]  If you have an EC meter or a PPM meter,
[14:16.370 --> 14:18.750]  get some of the water that comes out of that pot
[14:18.750 --> 14:21.290]  and measure the PPMs of that water
[14:21.290 --> 14:22.850]  and you wanna get it as low as you can.
[14:22.850 --> 14:24.750]  You want it, if you're going by,
[14:24.750 --> 14:25.890]  excuse the throat clearing there,
[14:25.890 --> 14:27.830]  if you're going by electrical conductivity,
[14:27.830 --> 14:32.190]  you wanna get it down into the like 1.1, 1.2 range.
[14:32.190 --> 14:33.450]  That's kinda where you want it.
[14:33.450 --> 14:35.690]  That means there's not a lot of stuff in there.
[14:35.690 --> 14:37.570]  Now, one thing that keeps ticking in the back of my head
[14:38.210 --> 14:39.890]  as I'm talking and it's reminding me, say this,
[14:39.890 --> 14:41.770]  if you don't have some perlite
[14:41.770 --> 14:44.410]  or some sort of aeration in your soil,
[14:44.410 --> 14:46.970]  it's easy to drown the plants with too much water.
[14:46.970 --> 14:47.830]  So keep that in mind.
[14:47.830 --> 14:49.350]  If you've got compacted soil
[14:49.350 --> 14:50.490]  that you didn't add anything to,
[14:50.490 --> 14:52.290]  and I think this guy said he's using Fox Farm,
[14:52.290 --> 14:53.130]  so you should be okay.
[14:53.130 --> 14:54.770]  You've got decently fluffy soil.
[14:54.770 --> 14:57.250]  Just pay attention to how much water is in there.
[14:57.250 --> 14:58.890]  Pay attention to how long it takes them to dry out.
[14:58.890 --> 15:00.530]  You don't wanna drown these plants.
[15:00.530 --> 15:03.370]  If you did not put any aeration in with your cocoa,
[15:03.370 --> 15:05.470]  you need to be more careful about how much water you use.
[15:05.470 --> 15:07.350]  I believe in using a lot of perlite.
[15:08.110 --> 15:09.830]  If you use more perlite, you need aeration.
[15:09.830 --> 15:11.710]  The roots love oxygen.
[15:11.710 --> 15:13.110]  They can handle more waterings.
[15:13.110 --> 15:14.950]  They'll dry out more evenly.
[15:14.950 --> 15:17.670]  I really think you should have some good perlite in there.
[15:17.670 --> 15:19.910]  So if you don't have some sort of aeration, be careful,
[15:19.910 --> 15:22.970]  because you can drown the plants with too much water.
[15:22.970 --> 15:24.630]  So flush them out.
[15:24.630 --> 15:26.030]  Start, pick a day.
[15:26.030 --> 15:27.350]  Think about your harvest day.
[15:27.350 --> 15:29.750]  Say you wanna harvest on the 14th.
[15:29.750 --> 15:31.750]  That means on the first, you need to get in there
[15:31.750 --> 15:33.350]  and pour like a gallon and a half of water
[15:33.350 --> 15:35.070]  through each gallon pot.
[15:35.070 --> 15:35.950]  Let it dry up.
[15:35.950 --> 15:37.730]  Probably take four or five days.
[15:37.730 --> 15:39.030]  Do the same thing.
[15:39.030 --> 15:39.870]  Let it dry up.
[15:39.870 --> 15:42.030]  Probably take four or five days.
[15:42.030 --> 15:42.870]  Do the same thing.
[15:42.870 --> 15:44.790]  Now you're at like what, 12 to 15 days.
[15:44.790 --> 15:46.270]  Now you're up here on the 14th or 15th.
[15:46.270 --> 15:47.290]  It's time to cut down your pot.
[15:47.290 --> 15:49.550]  Your leaves are starting to look gold.
[15:49.550 --> 15:50.950]  They're starting to get a little bit droopy.
[15:50.950 --> 15:52.050]  They might be a little bit crispy.
[15:52.050 --> 15:54.750]  That's how you know there's no nutrients left in there.
[15:54.750 --> 15:57.030]  So when you dry it, if you cure it properly,
[15:57.030 --> 15:58.650]  you put it in a jar, do all that stuff,
[15:58.650 --> 15:59.870]  that's a whole nother episode.
[15:59.870 --> 16:01.710]  When you smoke it, this stuff should leave
[16:01.710 --> 16:03.230]  a nice white ash.
[16:03.230 --> 16:04.590]  It shouldn't burn your throat.
[16:04.590 --> 16:06.230]  It shouldn't be funky at all
[16:06.230 --> 16:09.250]  if you properly flush your cannabis.
[16:09.250 --> 16:10.350]  So that was the long answer.
[16:10.350 --> 16:11.670]  I guess the short answer is no,
[16:11.670 --> 16:13.070]  you don't need to run all nine,
[16:13.070 --> 16:15.070]  or in this case we're gonna say six gallons of water
[16:15.070 --> 16:16.910]  through that pot at one time.
[16:16.910 --> 16:20.110]  It is better to stretch it out over a couple of weeks.
[16:20.110 --> 16:23.510]  You say your biweekly water so that will work perfectly.
[16:23.510 --> 16:25.670]  Stretch it out, flush them out.
[16:25.670 --> 16:26.810]  They will thank you.
[16:26.810 --> 16:28.270]  You will thank me for it.
[16:28.270 --> 16:29.770]  It will be well worth your time and energy.
[16:29.770 --> 16:31.630]  I don't know why people don't flush more
[16:31.630 --> 16:32.510]  because if you think about it,
[16:32.510 --> 16:33.970]  flushing is free.
[16:34.410 --> 16:35.410]  It doesn't cost anything but water.
[16:35.410 --> 16:37.090]  You're already gonna water the plants.
[16:37.090 --> 16:38.530]  Usually you would put nutrients in there
[16:38.530 --> 16:40.210]  that start making it cost money.
[16:40.210 --> 16:41.450]  And I know water does cost something,
[16:41.450 --> 16:42.970]  but it's next to nothing compared
[16:42.970 --> 16:44.530]  to all the other shit you pay for.
[16:44.530 --> 16:45.810]  So just give them water.
[16:45.810 --> 16:46.890]  You just have to keep them alive
[16:46.890 --> 16:49.290]  for another 14 days is all you have to do.
[16:49.290 --> 16:51.370]  It's not that challenging.
[16:51.370 --> 16:52.370]  Flush your plants.
[16:52.370 --> 16:54.050]  Also, here's a little hint.
[16:54.050 --> 16:56.770]  Reduce the lights by an hour or two
[16:56.770 --> 16:57.810]  while you're flushing.
[16:57.810 --> 16:59.650]  If you just wanna speed them up a little bit,
[16:59.650 --> 17:00.650]  turn the lights down.
[17:00.650 --> 17:03.050]  Instead of 1212, go maybe 1014
[17:03.050 --> 17:04.850]  at the end of flower for that last week.
[17:04.850 --> 17:07.010]  You might see some differences that you're happy with.
[17:07.010 --> 17:07.930]  I think you will like it.
[17:07.930 --> 17:11.450]  And it also saves you some money on your electrical bill.
[17:11.450 --> 17:13.190]  That's just my advice.
[17:13.190 --> 17:14.750]  All right, I wanna address another topic.
[17:14.750 --> 17:15.930]  Just something random.
[17:15.930 --> 17:18.010]  I was somewhere and people were just talking
[17:18.010 --> 17:19.810]  about random things and I heard this as a topic
[17:19.810 --> 17:22.490]  and I thought I should talk about that on the podcast.
[17:22.490 --> 17:23.570]  Somebody was taking dabs
[17:23.570 --> 17:25.490]  and they were trying to hold their dabs in
[17:25.490 --> 17:26.330]  as long as they could.
[17:26.330 --> 17:27.670]  And I was like, why do you hold your dabs so long?
[17:27.670 --> 17:28.970]  That's not good for you.
[17:28.970 --> 17:31.050]  And they're like, man, it's just like smoking weed.
[17:31.050 --> 17:32.650]  When you take a big hit, you gotta hold it in
[17:33.290 --> 17:34.330]  so you get everything, so you get as high
[17:34.330 --> 17:36.330]  as you can get off that hit.
[17:36.330 --> 17:38.090]  And honestly, you guys, I don't believe
[17:38.090 --> 17:39.410]  that to be accurate at all.
[17:39.410 --> 17:41.890]  I think holding in your smoke, whether it's a dab,
[17:41.890 --> 17:43.970]  whether it's a joint, whether it's a bong hit,
[17:43.970 --> 17:46.690]  holding in any kind of smoke cannot be good for you.
[17:46.690 --> 17:48.290]  You're putting pressure on your lungs,
[17:48.290 --> 17:49.710]  unnecessary pressure.
[17:49.710 --> 17:51.830]  Your lungs are basically little bags
[17:51.830 --> 17:53.730]  that fill up and empty with air
[17:53.730 --> 17:55.130]  and they got little sensitive parts in there.
[17:55.130 --> 17:57.130]  I'm not a doctor, but I know my lungs are sensitive
[17:57.130 --> 17:58.410]  and I can feel the pressure.
[17:58.410 --> 18:00.410]  When I used to take a bong hit and try to hold it,
[18:00.410 --> 18:01.570]  you feel your heart start racing
[18:01.570 --> 18:03.330]  and your blood pressure go up and shit.
[18:03.330 --> 18:05.250]  That's because your lungs are freaking out.
[18:05.250 --> 18:06.570]  You are not getting higher.
[18:06.570 --> 18:09.690]  You are giving yourself an increased risk
[18:09.690 --> 18:12.170]  of getting chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,
[18:12.170 --> 18:13.490]  also known as COPD.
[18:13.490 --> 18:16.290]  Holding smoke is a huge contributing factor
[18:16.290 --> 18:17.930]  to that disorder.
[18:17.930 --> 18:19.050]  It's a condition where you feel like
[18:19.050 --> 18:20.130]  you're drowning all the time.
[18:20.130 --> 18:23.010]  You can't breathe properly, you can't exhale properly,
[18:23.010 --> 18:24.610]  and it's fucking scary from what I've heard.
[18:24.610 --> 18:25.570]  I have not experienced it.
[18:25.570 --> 18:26.770]  I know people who have talked about it.
[18:26.770 --> 18:28.450]  I know somebody that's experienced it.
[18:28.450 --> 18:30.050]  It's not a fun thing.
[18:30.650 --> 18:32.730]  Quit stressing your lungs unnecessarily.
[18:32.730 --> 18:33.690]  Now people are gonna argue and say,
[18:33.690 --> 18:35.690]  but you get higher if you hold it.
[18:35.690 --> 18:36.890]  No, you don't.
[18:36.890 --> 18:39.850]  You may get a head rush, you get a lack of oxygen,
[18:39.850 --> 18:42.690]  your heart races, but you're not getting more cannabinoids
[18:42.690 --> 18:43.890]  from holding in your hit.
[18:43.890 --> 18:45.530]  Your lungs are a mucus membrane.
[18:45.530 --> 18:48.130]  I feel like the smoke hits your lungs
[18:48.130 --> 18:50.050]  and anything that's gonna get in goes in
[18:50.050 --> 18:51.730]  and what doesn't, coats your lungs.
[18:51.730 --> 18:53.090]  It stays right there.
[18:53.090 --> 18:54.530]  I've said this on the podcast before.
[18:54.530 --> 18:57.530]  When I take a gigantic dab, and I'm not bragging,
[18:57.530 --> 18:58.970]  this is just how I like to do things
[18:58.970 --> 19:00.490]  and I don't have a lot of time
[19:00.490 --> 19:02.130]  and this is just my preferred method.
[19:02.130 --> 19:04.130]  I like to take about a half gram dab.
[19:04.130 --> 19:05.010]  I'm not joking.
[19:05.010 --> 19:06.930]  If you hang out with me, you will testify.
[19:06.930 --> 19:08.770]  People are going, yeah, he fucking takes a half gram dab.
[19:08.770 --> 19:11.210]  I take a half gram dab on a regular basis.
[19:11.210 --> 19:13.050]  I feel like that half gram dab
[19:13.050 --> 19:15.970]  gets me really super medicated for a few minutes.
[19:15.970 --> 19:19.410]  I get medicinal value and I also get really high from it,
[19:19.410 --> 19:21.330]  which sometimes is what I'm going for.
[19:21.330 --> 19:22.730]  But when I'm done with the high,
[19:22.730 --> 19:26.910]  I still have this layer of oily hash permeating my lungs
[19:26.910 --> 19:29.430]  and I feel like it's a slow release capsule.
[19:29.430 --> 19:33.830]  My lungs are dissolving and absorbing the cannabinoids
[19:33.830 --> 19:37.230]  from this hash as it melts into my lungs as it's available
[19:37.230 --> 19:38.710]  because my lungs can't get it all at once.
[19:38.710 --> 19:40.230]  I think it just sits there.
[19:40.230 --> 19:42.630]  And so I don't see a need to hold in that smoke in my lungs
[19:42.630 --> 19:44.350]  and put so much pressure on there
[19:44.350 --> 19:45.590]  when I can just get the smoke in there
[19:45.590 --> 19:47.590]  and let it work like the filter that it is.
[19:47.590 --> 19:51.150]  Okay, imagine if you blew smoke through any kind of filter.
[19:51.150 --> 19:52.350]  We'll just say get a paper towel,
[19:52.350 --> 19:53.910]  fold a paper towel into four pieces
[19:53.910 --> 19:55.110]  and blow your smoke through it.
[19:55.110 --> 19:57.910]  It's gonna leave some shit on all four layers.
[19:57.910 --> 20:00.050]  Your lungs gather that shit more quickly
[20:00.050 --> 20:01.910]  than the paper towel does.
[20:01.910 --> 20:03.710]  Your lungs are natural, they're part of your body.
[20:03.710 --> 20:06.070]  They will break down that shit and you will receive it
[20:06.070 --> 20:08.070]  just like you're supposed to over time.
[20:08.070 --> 20:09.750]  You can't scrape it out of the paper towel,
[20:09.750 --> 20:12.510]  but your lungs will kind of clean themselves and absorb it.
[20:12.510 --> 20:14.390]  This is my belief, I'm not a doctor.
[20:14.390 --> 20:17.550]  So I think holding your smoke is a bad idea.
[20:17.550 --> 20:19.230]  I think you're gonna fuck up your lungs.
[20:19.230 --> 20:20.890]  I think there's no reason to do that.
[20:20.890 --> 20:22.990]  I think you're getting it all when you exhale
[20:22.990 --> 20:25.150]  and that smoke passes your lungs.
[20:25.150 --> 20:26.310]  It just went through the filters
[20:26.310 --> 20:27.610]  and gathered all the shit that you need.
[20:27.610 --> 20:28.590]  And then when you blow it out,
[20:28.590 --> 20:30.470]  you're just blowing out all the shit that you don't need.
[20:30.470 --> 20:32.590]  There's no reason to keep in all that bad part.
[20:32.590 --> 20:35.050]  You're smoking carcinogens, you're smoking soot,
[20:35.050 --> 20:37.030]  you're smoking green leafy matter.
[20:37.030 --> 20:39.150]  You're not trying to consume green leaves.
[20:39.150 --> 20:41.310]  You're trying to consume cannabinoids.
[20:41.310 --> 20:43.990]  That's the part you want and probably terps.
[20:43.990 --> 20:45.550]  That's the part you're trying to get in.
[20:45.550 --> 20:47.530]  So just get the terps, get the cannabinoids,
[20:47.530 --> 20:48.750]  get that into your lungs
[20:48.750 --> 20:51.310]  and get the rest of that shit out of there, into the air.
[20:51.310 --> 20:52.750]  You don't need to hold your hits so long.
[20:53.510 --> 20:54.470]  And if you want to argue with me,
[20:54.470 --> 20:56.910]  I would love to hear your reasonable argument as an adult.
[20:56.910 --> 20:57.790]  Don't just bitch at me.
[20:57.790 --> 20:59.390]  If you've got some supporting evidence,
[20:59.390 --> 21:00.630]  I would love to hear it.
[21:00.630 --> 21:01.470]  You can send me an email.
[21:01.470 --> 21:03.230]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:03.230 --> 21:04.870]  If you feel like I'm wrong on this matter,
[21:04.870 --> 21:06.110]  please do correct me.
[21:06.110 --> 21:08.290]  I would like to hear your information.
[21:08.290 --> 21:11.670]  Also, let's talk about something else that bothers me.
[21:11.670 --> 21:16.150]  I have been buying some hash that has the consistency
[21:16.150 --> 21:19.470]  of maybe cake batter or soft cheesecake
[21:19.470 --> 21:20.550]  and it's delicious hash.
[21:20.550 --> 21:22.690]  And I offered some to a couple of people
[21:23.630 --> 21:25.610]  and they said, why do you smoke that unpurged shit?
[21:25.610 --> 21:27.730]  And I was like, what are you talking about, unpurged?
[21:27.730 --> 21:30.650]  For some reason, people are under the impression
[21:30.650 --> 21:33.570]  that waxes and batters
[21:33.570 --> 21:38.370]  and other type consistencies are not purged.
[21:38.370 --> 21:40.930]  They think that it's got to shatter to be purged
[21:40.930 --> 21:43.930]  or it's got to be live resin or it's not purged.
[21:43.930 --> 21:46.130]  That is not right at all.
[21:46.130 --> 21:47.170]  I just want to correct that.
[21:47.170 --> 21:50.390]  The waxes, the batters, they are all purged.
[21:50.390 --> 21:52.830]  People seem to think that it is battery
[21:52.830 --> 21:55.670]  because there is still solvent in there.
[21:55.670 --> 21:56.750]  Let me back up a little bit.
[21:56.750 --> 22:01.190]  The hash I'm smoking is BHO, it's butane honey oil.
[22:01.190 --> 22:02.590]  When we first started making it,
[22:02.590 --> 22:04.030]  everybody wanted it to shatter.
[22:04.030 --> 22:06.110]  If it shattered, that was the best you can get.
[22:06.110 --> 22:08.390]  People learned how to heat it and whip it.
[22:08.390 --> 22:11.030]  You just basically whip it just like you would
[22:11.030 --> 22:12.430]  whip up cake batter or something.
[22:12.430 --> 22:14.030]  You try to make it fluffy, you put air in it,
[22:14.030 --> 22:16.230]  and that gives it a waxy texture.
[22:16.230 --> 22:18.510]  You have to purge it either way.
[22:18.510 --> 22:21.430]  They will make the shatter, then they purge the shatter,
[22:21.430 --> 22:24.270]  then they whip it to turn it into other consistencies.
[22:24.270 --> 22:26.350]  You guys that are thinking that my batters
[22:26.350 --> 22:29.110]  and the waxes that I'm getting from places are not purged,
[22:29.110 --> 22:29.950]  you are wrong.
[22:29.950 --> 22:32.270]  Stop spreading that bullshit, please.
[22:32.270 --> 22:33.990]  Please, it's purged.
[22:33.990 --> 22:36.030]  I can't promise you that the stuff you're getting purged
[22:36.030 --> 22:37.950]  or that you're buying off the street
[22:37.950 --> 22:39.430]  or wherever you're getting it is purged
[22:39.430 --> 22:40.470]  because I'm not in your neighborhood.
[22:40.470 --> 22:41.910]  I don't know what you're smoking.
[22:41.910 --> 22:44.070]  But the stuff that's coming from the dispensaries,
[22:44.070 --> 22:46.750]  if it came from the dispensary, it had to pass a test.
[22:46.750 --> 22:47.930]  So it is purged.
[22:48.370 --> 22:49.650]  Please stop saying wax isn't purged.
[22:49.650 --> 22:51.170]  That's my main point.
[22:51.170 --> 22:52.930]  And while I'm at it, I've got one more thing
[22:52.930 --> 22:56.090]  I wanna rant about, and then we will wrap up this podcast.
[22:56.090 --> 22:57.570]  Be careful with buzzwords.
[22:58.530 --> 23:00.850]  I see a lot of people talking about the word organic.
[23:00.850 --> 23:01.930]  Organic is awesome.
[23:02.750 --> 23:04.210]  Organic shit is great.
[23:04.210 --> 23:05.650]  I would prefer organic vegetables
[23:05.650 --> 23:08.010]  over non-organic vegetables if I had the option.
[23:09.270 --> 23:11.770]  I wanna remind you that cyanide is organic.
[23:12.630 --> 23:14.930]  So just because people say this product is organic
[23:14.930 --> 23:16.770]  or this pesticide is organic
[23:16.770 --> 23:18.170]  doesn't mean it's harmless.
[23:18.170 --> 23:19.530]  It doesn't mean it's gentle.
[23:19.530 --> 23:20.930]  It doesn't mean it's safe.
[23:20.930 --> 23:25.350]  It doesn't mean that you can consume it without any worry.
[23:25.350 --> 23:28.450]  Some organic compounds are just as dangerous
[23:28.450 --> 23:31.330]  and just as harmful as man-made chemicals,
[23:31.330 --> 23:34.410]  if not more dangerous and more harmful.
[23:34.410 --> 23:37.430]  So my point is, be careful with buzzwords, you guys.
[23:37.430 --> 23:39.310]  People can say these plants were treated
[23:39.310 --> 23:42.850]  with only organic products, and you can still be at risk.
[23:42.850 --> 23:45.530]  The bottle of pesticide you were considering purchasing
[23:45.530 --> 23:48.650]  can be labeled organic, and it can still be dangerous.
[23:48.650 --> 23:50.130]  Just because something says organic
[23:50.130 --> 23:51.970]  doesn't mean you can go in your grow room
[23:51.970 --> 23:55.210]  and spray the shit without some sort of protection.
[23:55.210 --> 23:56.450]  Even if it says organic,
[23:56.450 --> 23:58.810]  please read the label a little more carefully.
[23:58.810 --> 24:00.730]  If you're using an organic pesticide,
[24:00.730 --> 24:02.890]  check out what kind of personal protective equipment
[24:02.890 --> 24:04.250]  you need to be wearing.
[24:04.250 --> 24:06.390]  My main point here was that we're all falling
[24:06.390 --> 24:08.610]  for the word organic, and we're spending extra money
[24:08.610 --> 24:10.750]  for organic things, and we're trusting things
[24:10.750 --> 24:14.530]  because of that organic stamp, because of that Omri stamp.
[24:14.530 --> 24:17.410]  I wanna remind you that you still need to read the label.
[24:17.410 --> 24:20.450]  Don't trust anybody, don't trust any labels.
[24:20.450 --> 24:21.870]  Check for yourself.
[24:21.870 --> 24:23.370]  Know what you're spraying on your products,
[24:23.370 --> 24:24.210]  know what you're eating.
[24:24.210 --> 24:26.010]  This doesn't just apply to cannabis.
[24:26.010 --> 24:30.210]  This applies to everything with the word organic on it.
[24:30.210 --> 24:31.770]  All right, that's my public service announcement
[24:31.770 --> 24:33.290]  because I care about you guys,
[24:33.290 --> 24:35.090]  and I want you to take care of yourselves.
[24:35.090 --> 24:36.790]  I want you to take care of each other,
[24:36.790 --> 24:40.110]  and all together, I want you to take care of our world.
[24:40.110 --> 24:41.390]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[24:41.390 --> 24:42.770]  I'm gonna start wrapping up this podcast.
[24:42.770 --> 24:44.290]  It looks like it's gonna be a short one.
[24:45.050 --> 24:45.890]  I've got a busy week ahead of me.
[24:45.890 --> 24:48.090]  I am in the middle of a busy week.
[24:48.090 --> 24:51.290]  This weekend, I am going to be at Dick's
[24:51.290 --> 24:53.650]  seeing my favorite band on the damn planet.
[24:53.650 --> 24:55.650]  That's right, Phish is in Denver for three nights,
[24:55.650 --> 24:57.690]  so Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[24:57.690 --> 24:59.770]  By the time this comes out, I will already have seen
[24:59.770 --> 25:01.590]  Phish at Dick's Sporting Goods,
[25:01.590 --> 25:04.010]  the big, giant soccer field in Denver,
[25:04.010 --> 25:05.210]  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,
[25:05.210 --> 25:07.570]  and then Monday, when this podcast comes out,
[25:07.570 --> 25:09.970]  I get to see Mr. Doug Benson at Comedy Works
[25:09.970 --> 25:12.810]  doing some standup, so I've got a busy week coming up.
[25:12.810 --> 25:14.110]  I had a busy week last week.
[25:14.110 --> 25:15.630]  Of course, I saw Bert Kreischer.
[25:15.630 --> 25:17.350]  We were in the middle of a whole bunch of transitions
[25:17.350 --> 25:18.190]  at The Grow.
[25:18.190 --> 25:19.330]  Of course, I do run The Big Grow
[25:19.330 --> 25:21.690]  for Three Rivers in Pueblo, Colorado.
[25:21.690 --> 25:23.970]  We have a medical and a recreational side of the store,
[25:23.970 --> 25:25.890]  so if you're looking to shop for cannabis
[25:25.890 --> 25:28.610]  in the city of Pueblo, I would highly recommend
[25:28.610 --> 25:32.410]  Three Rivers Dispensary on 1714 South Santa Fe.
[25:32.410 --> 25:33.690]  They do not pay me to say that.
[25:33.690 --> 25:35.530]  I am their grower, and I take pride in my work,
[25:35.530 --> 25:36.390]  so go check that out.
[25:36.390 --> 25:37.770]  Let me know what you think.
[25:38.850 --> 25:39.810]  It's gonna be a long week, you guys.
[25:39.810 --> 25:43.010]  I may or may not put out a Thursday episode this week,
[25:43.010 --> 25:45.290]  so if there's no Thursday episode, I apologize.
[25:45.290 --> 25:46.650]  It's because there was a holiday weekend,
[25:46.650 --> 25:50.730]  and sometimes even Rasta Jeff needs a break.
[25:50.730 --> 25:51.550]  All right, I wanna thank you guys
[25:51.550 --> 25:52.610]  for listening to this podcast.
[25:52.610 --> 25:53.970]  I wanna thank my friend on Instagram
[25:53.970 --> 25:57.130]  for sending me the wonderful question about flushing.
[25:57.130 --> 25:58.890]  Of course, if you do have a question for me,

[26:00.190 --> 26:02.130]  but I would prefer the email address.

[26:21.090 --> 26:22.990]  some beautiful cannabis photography.

[26:40.930 --> 26:42.530]  I run a breeding program.

[26:52.450 --> 26:54.490]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[26:54.490 --> 26:56.010]  That's right, if you feel like this podcast
[26:56.010 --> 26:57.630]  was worth a couple of bucks of your time,
[26:57.630 --> 27:01.130]  simply check out patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[27:01.130 --> 27:06.130]  It's P-A-T-R-E-O-N.com slash growfromyourheart.

[27:10.650 --> 27:11.830]  to keep me afloat.
[27:11.830 --> 27:13.050]  I'm not trying to get rich off the show.
[27:13.050 --> 27:14.130]  I do have a full-time job.
[27:14.130 --> 27:16.330]  I do have a breeding program and a seed company.
[27:16.330 --> 27:18.090]  What I'm going to do with your funds
[27:18.090 --> 27:19.690]  is I'm going to buy things like these little
[27:19.690 --> 27:21.210]  microphone covers so that my guests
[27:21.210 --> 27:22.930]  don't have to spit into the same cover.
[27:22.930 --> 27:24.990]  I use it to pay for my web hosting.
[27:24.990 --> 27:26.010]  It costs me a little bit of money
[27:26.010 --> 27:27.890]  to cover my web hosting every year.
[27:27.890 --> 27:30.270]  I do host my podcast on my own website.
[27:30.270 --> 27:31.890]  My website looks like crap right now.
[27:31.890 --> 27:32.950]  I do apologize for that.
[27:32.950 --> 27:34.450]  My friend that runs that is overwhelmed.
[27:34.490 --> 27:36.610]  I am not a web design kind of a guy.
[27:36.610 --> 27:38.330]  A listener reached out and is going to do
[27:38.330 --> 27:40.330]  some upgrades to that, he says.
[27:40.330 --> 27:41.370]  Big thank you for that.
[27:41.370 --> 27:43.490]  I can't wait to see that happen.
[27:43.490 --> 27:47.050]  But anyway, patreon.com slash growfromyourheart
[27:47.050 --> 27:49.050]  if you'd like to help out, I would appreciate it.
[27:49.050 --> 27:51.050]  If you can't help out, that is fine.
[27:51.050 --> 27:53.810]  Somebody does want to help out and they will cover you.
[27:53.810 --> 27:55.050]  Keep listening to the podcast.
[27:55.050 --> 27:57.690]  This is meant to be free for everybody.
[27:57.690 --> 27:58.870]  I want you to keep listening.
[27:58.870 --> 28:02.250]  Free freedom, legalize cannabis one click at a time with me.
[28:02.250 --> 28:03.610]  Keep listening for free.
[28:03.610 --> 28:04.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can listen
[28:04.690 --> 28:05.890]  to the podcast on iTunes.

[28:09.390 --> 28:11.610]  are now available on YouTube.
[28:11.610 --> 28:13.610]  So wherever you're listening, I'm sure there's a way
[28:13.610 --> 28:15.850]  for you to leave a comment or a review.
[28:15.850 --> 28:18.010]  iTunes has the ratings and reviews section.
[28:18.010 --> 28:19.970]  Stitcher has a ratings and reviews section.
[28:19.970 --> 28:22.610]  And YouTube certainly has a comments section.
[28:22.610 --> 28:25.930]  I would love to hear your opinions.
[28:25.930 --> 28:27.730]  Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between,
[28:27.730 --> 28:30.650]  I will be back next week with a brand new fresh episode.
[28:30.650 --> 28:32.610]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Brett,
[28:32.610 --> 28:34.370]  who is also known as Mary's Motivation.
[28:34.370 --> 28:35.410]  Dude, you're a great dude.
[28:35.410 --> 28:37.650]  I love seeing your positivity all the time.
[28:37.650 --> 28:39.130]  Never stop with that shit.
[28:39.130 --> 28:41.450]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[28:41.450 --> 28:43.010]  and give your mom a hug for me.
