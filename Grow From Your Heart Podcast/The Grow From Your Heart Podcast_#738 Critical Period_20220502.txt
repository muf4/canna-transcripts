[00:05.950 --> 00:28.350]  All right, here we go. Welcome to the show, Podcast World. I'm your host. My friends call
[00:28.350 --> 00:35.310]  me Rasta Jeff. This is episode 738 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. In this episode,
[00:35.310 --> 00:39.830]  I'm going to focus on a grow question about flowering our plants outdoors. Before I get
[00:39.830 --> 00:44.350]  to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those kind folks who continue
[00:44.410 --> 00:49.510]  to support the show on Patreon. Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[00:49.510 --> 00:53.910]  thank you shout out to my friend Caribou Heart TV. Let's send a fist bump and a thank you
[00:53.910 --> 00:58.350]  shout out to single T. Let's send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Danny Potts. Let's
[00:58.350 --> 01:01.870]  send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Rutt Row and Kanna Reaper. Let's send a
[01:01.870 --> 01:05.970]  big thank you shout out to my buddy Pak Northwest Dan. Let's send a big thank you shout out
[01:05.970 --> 01:09.690]  to choke Norris. I want to send a Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[01:09.690 --> 01:11.610]  our buddy Spartan420.
[01:11.610 --> 01:14.130]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to CaptainMojo.
[01:14.130 --> 01:16.450]  I wanna send a thank you shout out to our dude Frankie.

[01:18.210 --> 01:19.570]  to Rasta Green Thumb.
[01:19.570 --> 01:21.010]  I wanna send a special thank you shout out
[01:21.010 --> 01:22.490]  to my buddy Sam Heads.
[01:22.490 --> 01:24.050]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big
[01:24.050 --> 01:26.610]  Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:26.610 --> 01:28.750]  to Thor's Trike Factory.
[01:28.750 --> 01:30.930]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[01:30.930 --> 01:33.530]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:33.530 --> 01:35.370]  If you are not already supporting the show
[01:35.370 --> 01:37.090]  and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:37.090 --> 01:41.530]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[01:41.530 --> 01:43.330]  forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:43.330 --> 01:45.290]  All of the information you need will be right there
[01:45.290 --> 01:47.590]  on the screen and you know I do include a link
[01:47.590 --> 01:50.050]  in the show notes and in the video description
[01:50.050 --> 01:52.630]  to make it nice and easy for all of my friends
[01:52.630 --> 01:55.010]  to support the show.
[01:55.010 --> 01:57.450]  Speaking of Patreon, I did have the honor,
[01:57.450 --> 01:59.970]  the privilege, the pleasure, whatever other
[01:59.970 --> 02:01.930]  P starting words you wanna throw in there
[02:01.930 --> 02:04.930]  to record a Patreon podcast with my buddy Mike.
[02:04.930 --> 02:06.970]  That's right it was an honor, a privilege,
[02:06.970 --> 02:09.610]  a privileged Patreon podcast if you will.
[02:09.610 --> 02:10.930]  I'm just exaggerating now.
[02:10.930 --> 02:13.750]  I did record a Patreon only podcast with my buddy Mike.
[02:13.750 --> 02:16.670]  Mike came over recently, we sat here for two or three hours.
[02:16.670 --> 02:19.490]  We ate a bunch of edibles and we did a podcast.
[02:19.490 --> 02:21.690]  We did not cover any Grow Talk.
[02:21.690 --> 02:23.610]  We made sure not to cover Grow Talk.
[02:23.610 --> 02:26.950]  I don't wanna waste Grow Talk on the Patreon only episodes.
[02:26.950 --> 02:29.650]  If you are watching this, check out the Patreon episode
[02:29.650 --> 02:31.990]  where Mike and I eat some edibles, we get lit.
[02:31.990 --> 02:33.650]  If you're not already on the Patreon,
[02:33.650 --> 02:35.690]  now is the time to join the Patreon.
[02:35.690 --> 02:37.690]  Mike and I do eat 100 milligrams of edibles.
[02:37.690 --> 02:40.090]  We smoked a lot of dabs, smoked a lot of flour.
[02:40.090 --> 02:42.230]  Mike got a little quiet toward the end of the show.
[02:42.230 --> 02:43.850]  I was super lit, it was a good time.
[02:43.850 --> 02:45.770]  That will be a Patreon only episode.
[02:45.770 --> 02:48.890]  My point is we did not do any Grow content in that episode
[02:48.890 --> 02:50.770]  because I've promised the listeners
[02:50.770 --> 02:53.450]  that I will keep Grow content free.
[02:53.450 --> 02:54.930]  I want everybody to be able to grow
[02:54.930 --> 02:57.090]  the best product we possibly can grow.
[02:57.090 --> 02:59.010]  Medical patients need the best product.
[02:59.010 --> 03:01.230]  Recreational consumers need the best product.
[03:01.230 --> 03:02.530]  You need to be able to grow the best.
[03:02.530 --> 03:04.530]  I don't wanna put that behind a paywall.
[03:04.530 --> 03:06.970]  I want the Grow lessons, the education to be free.
[03:06.970 --> 03:09.790]  So what we did was we gave the patrons a bonus episode
[03:09.790 --> 03:11.330]  of just hanging out, getting lit,
[03:11.330 --> 03:13.110]  kinda connecting with us, chilling out.
[03:13.110 --> 03:14.010]  I think it was a good time.
[03:14.010 --> 03:15.330]  I hope you will enjoy it.
[03:15.330 --> 03:17.410]  If you watch that, please send me some feedback
[03:17.410 --> 03:19.490]  because we wanna do more of those episodes.
[03:19.490 --> 03:21.330]  Once again, thank you to Mike for popping in
[03:21.330 --> 03:22.570]  and doing the Patreon episode.
[03:22.570 --> 03:25.370]  And I do encourage you, invite you, implore you.
[03:25.370 --> 03:26.770]  Is that the word I'm looking for?
[03:26.770 --> 03:29.250]  Go check out the Patreon and check out the video
[03:29.250 --> 03:30.330]  that I recorded with Mike.
[03:31.050 --> 03:33.370]  I will be up at the beginning of the month of May.
[03:33.370 --> 03:35.930]  The patrons for the month of May will get that video.
[03:35.930 --> 03:39.130]  I'm going to try to provide a Patreon video once a month.
[03:39.130 --> 03:41.050]  It may contain Mike, it may just be me,
[03:41.050 --> 03:42.370]  it may be other people.
[03:42.370 --> 03:43.950]  Who knows what could happen?
[03:43.950 --> 03:44.850]  Send me your ideas.
[03:44.850 --> 03:46.850]  All right, let's quit rambling about Patreon.
[03:46.850 --> 03:49.610]  I said that I've got a Grow question here in front of me.
[03:49.610 --> 03:53.010]  Outdoor season is quickly coming upon us.
[03:53.010 --> 03:55.110]  People are setting up their plants indoors.
[03:55.110 --> 03:58.170]  A lot of people at least are vegging their plants indoors.
[03:58.170 --> 04:00.050]  They're gonna veg indoors.
[04:00.770 --> 04:01.610]  If you're doing it correctly,
[04:01.610 --> 04:04.490]  last year you ran some seeds or got some clones
[04:04.490 --> 04:06.030]  or got a plant from somebody,
[04:06.030 --> 04:08.390]  then you grew that and you made sure that it is quality.
[04:08.390 --> 04:11.530]  If you grew from seed, hopefully you eliminated the boys,
[04:11.530 --> 04:13.210]  you eliminated anything intersex,
[04:13.210 --> 04:15.170]  you eliminated anything problematic,
[04:15.170 --> 04:16.850]  and you found a gem of a keeper
[04:16.850 --> 04:18.910]  that you want to put outside this year.
[04:18.910 --> 04:20.490]  So you've done your research, done your work,
[04:20.490 --> 04:22.810]  you've got a quality plant to put outside.
[04:22.810 --> 04:24.210]  Now people are vegging those.
[04:24.210 --> 04:26.210]  Some people have been vegging since January.
[04:26.210 --> 04:27.890]  They started their clone, their seed,
[04:27.890 --> 04:29.970]  however they want to do it since January.
[04:30.770 --> 04:31.650]  It's getting big, they've now sexed it,
[04:31.650 --> 04:32.930]  they've made sure it's a female,
[04:32.930 --> 04:34.850]  they've got a clone of it, they know what they've got.
[04:34.850 --> 04:35.810]  It's getting bigger and bigger.
[04:35.810 --> 04:37.950]  They're gonna put it outside pretty soon.
[04:37.950 --> 04:40.130]  I'm going to see on social media a lot of people
[04:40.130 --> 04:42.250]  saying that they put their plants outside
[04:42.250 --> 04:43.770]  and immediately when they put them outside,
[04:43.770 --> 04:44.970]  they went into flower.
[04:44.970 --> 04:46.810]  And they're gonna go into flower too early.
[04:46.810 --> 04:49.450]  Then those plants are going to go back into a veg.
[04:49.450 --> 04:51.670]  They're gonna continue a little bit of a veg cycle.
[04:51.670 --> 04:54.010]  Then once they get settled into that veg phase,
[04:54.010 --> 04:55.650]  Mother Nature out there is going to adjust
[04:55.650 --> 04:57.450]  to the actual flowering cycle.
[04:57.450 --> 04:59.210]  Then they will want the plants to go into flower.
[05:00.010 --> 05:01.890]  They're gonna be weird, they're gonna be upset,
[05:01.890 --> 05:04.010]  they're not gonna be the quality which they could have been
[05:04.010 --> 05:07.490]  if we timed this better, if we understood what was going on.
[05:07.490 --> 05:08.930]  What's gonna happen?
[05:08.930 --> 05:10.850]  A lot of people are going to take their plants
[05:10.850 --> 05:12.770]  from their grow room where they're giving them
[05:12.770 --> 05:15.370]  18 hours of light, 18 and six, maybe more,
[05:15.370 --> 05:17.010]  maybe 24 hours of light.
[05:17.010 --> 05:20.410]  And they're getting direct light from an LED or an HPS
[05:20.410 --> 05:21.570]  or maybe it's just a T5,
[05:21.570 --> 05:23.610]  but they're getting a lot of direct light out there
[05:23.610 --> 05:25.330]  and they're not getting any stressors.
[05:25.330 --> 05:27.970]  And you're giving them a solid light schedule.
[05:27.970 --> 05:30.410]  And you're gonna take them outside because you think
[05:30.410 --> 05:32.870]  by looking at the sun and the sky
[05:32.870 --> 05:36.410]  that we're getting more than 12 hours of light outside.
[05:36.410 --> 05:39.550]  So those plants should continue to veg outdoors
[05:39.550 --> 05:41.250]  is what a lot of people think.
[05:41.250 --> 05:42.770]  But sometimes that doesn't happen.
[05:42.770 --> 05:45.450]  And that is because of a couple of factors.
[05:45.450 --> 05:47.490]  I do have an email that I want to read.
[05:47.490 --> 05:50.170]  This will set me up to get further into this topic.
[05:50.170 --> 05:52.630]  I may skim through this because there's a lot of this email.
[05:52.630 --> 05:54.550]  It's not all necessary.
[05:54.550 --> 05:56.850]  Our friend is as long winded as myself here.
[05:56.850 --> 05:58.130]  So let me try to edit this
[05:58.130 --> 05:59.770]  and we'll make something out of this message.
[05:59.770 --> 06:04.570]  It says, bro, I really appreciate the way you do what you do
[06:04.570 --> 06:08.190]  you are a positive light and you are contagious.
[06:08.190 --> 06:09.150]  That is awesome.
[06:09.150 --> 06:10.330]  Somebody taught me a long time ago
[06:10.330 --> 06:12.570]  that smiles are contagious.
[06:12.570 --> 06:14.810]  Somebody also taught me that don't complain
[06:14.810 --> 06:15.690]  because nobody gives a shit
[06:15.690 --> 06:17.650]  and it makes people just not want to be around you.
[06:17.650 --> 06:19.830]  So try to smile, try to have the good vibes,
[06:19.830 --> 06:21.050]  especially when a camera's on,
[06:21.050 --> 06:22.330]  there's no reason to come on a camera
[06:22.330 --> 06:24.410]  when I'm in a bad mood, not having a good vibe.
[06:24.410 --> 06:26.490]  I do have bad days.
[06:27.130 --> 06:27.970]  Shit does happen in my life.
[06:27.970 --> 06:29.130]  I just don't share that with the world.
[06:29.130 --> 06:31.290]  There's no need to put that shit out there.
[06:31.290 --> 06:32.610]  Just shed love and light.
[06:32.610 --> 06:34.370]  So thank you, I'm glad that you noticed that.
[06:34.370 --> 06:37.350]  I'm glad you like the way I do what I do
[06:37.350 --> 06:39.410]  because I'm just doing it the way I know how to do it.
[06:39.410 --> 06:41.750]  I couldn't change it if I tried, so thank you.
[06:41.750 --> 06:44.330]  It goes on, it says you are an extremely thorough,
[06:44.330 --> 06:46.490]  you are extremely thorough in the way you teach.
[06:46.490 --> 06:47.770]  That's why I'm pretty stoked
[06:47.770 --> 06:51.250]  and I think I might have something for you to riff on here
[06:51.250 --> 06:54.090]  and pretty much never gets covered by anybody.
[06:54.690 --> 06:56.610]  I've read this email, you are very correct.
[06:56.610 --> 06:58.370]  This does not get covered by a lot of people.
[06:58.370 --> 07:01.010]  A lot of people don't understand this concept,
[07:01.010 --> 07:02.250]  this phenomena here.
[07:02.250 --> 07:04.430]  Is it a font phenomenon, a phenomena?
[07:05.530 --> 07:06.810]  I should have did that research,
[07:06.810 --> 07:07.970]  should have learned the words, right?
[07:07.970 --> 07:10.290]  I speak a lot of English, I should know the words.
[07:10.290 --> 07:12.970]  But anyway, you're right, nobody does talk about this a lot
[07:12.970 --> 07:15.950]  so and I appreciate that you think I am a thorough teacher.
[07:15.950 --> 07:18.530]  Sometimes people say that I will repeat myself
[07:18.530 --> 07:20.890]  and beat a subject into the ground too many times.
[07:20.890 --> 07:22.970]  That's because there are different types of learners.
[07:22.970 --> 07:26.050]  Some people learn visually, some people learn hands-on,
[07:26.050 --> 07:27.930]  some people learn by being told,
[07:27.930 --> 07:30.130]  some people have to have the combination of all three,
[07:30.130 --> 07:32.690]  some people need shit literally beaten into them.
[07:32.690 --> 07:35.730]  So I try to approach a topic multiple different directions,
[07:35.730 --> 07:37.730]  give a few different ways to learn the same thing
[07:37.730 --> 07:40.090]  because there are a lot of people watching the show
[07:40.090 --> 07:42.090]  and a lot of people learning from,
[07:42.090 --> 07:43.510]  they have different learning styles.
[07:43.510 --> 07:44.650]  I wanna make sure to get everybody.
[07:44.650 --> 07:46.890]  I know that stoners have ADD.
[07:46.890 --> 07:48.770]  We all, we didn't like school
[07:48.770 --> 07:50.310]  because we had somebody just lecturing us
[07:50.310 --> 07:51.590]  about some shit we didn't care about,
[07:51.590 --> 07:53.030]  but we all like to learn.
[07:53.030 --> 07:55.250]  We're passionately curious about stuff we care about.
[07:55.250 --> 07:57.250]  I just didn't care about a lot of the shit in school.
[07:57.250 --> 07:58.530]  I am rambling.
[07:58.530 --> 07:59.650]  This goes on, it says,
[07:59.650 --> 08:01.270]  I wanna say something about the process
[08:01.270 --> 08:04.210]  by which cannabis plants transition themselves
[08:04.210 --> 08:07.870]  from a vegetative stage to a flowering stage outdoors.
[08:07.870 --> 08:09.910]  That is a very good conversation
[08:09.910 --> 08:11.570]  to be had at this time of year.
[08:11.570 --> 08:15.070]  It says, I think, and he has think in capital letters,
[08:15.070 --> 08:17.030]  I think it is right to call this thing
[08:17.030 --> 08:18.530]  that happens as a trait,
[08:18.530 --> 08:20.630]  just like the flowering time is a trait
[08:20.630 --> 08:22.090]  that can vary between sisters.
[08:22.090 --> 08:24.770]  The flower trigger event varies greatly as well
[08:24.770 --> 08:26.250]  from plant to plant.
[08:26.250 --> 08:27.970]  This is my experience anyway.
[08:27.970 --> 08:32.010]  Typically, the equatorial sativa-dominant varietals
[08:32.010 --> 08:34.570]  can be put up to a month earlier
[08:34.570 --> 08:36.410]  than your indica-heavy varietals
[08:36.410 --> 08:40.330]  with no chance of early flower and a resulting revege,
[08:40.330 --> 08:41.650]  but not always.
[08:41.650 --> 08:42.730]  So this is a great topic.
[08:42.730 --> 08:45.110]  If you haven't followed along to what this person is saying,
[08:45.110 --> 08:49.330]  they are addressing the fact that some plants,
[08:49.330 --> 08:51.030]  so there are traits in our plants.
[08:51.030 --> 08:53.310]  Let me back up and cover a couple of things that he said.
[08:53.310 --> 08:55.650]  Aroma is a trait of the plant.
[08:55.650 --> 08:57.270]  Potency is a trait of the plant,
[08:57.270 --> 09:00.050]  a characteristic, an attribute of that plant.
[09:00.050 --> 09:03.130]  Flowering time is a trait of the plant.
[09:03.130 --> 09:05.070]  There's a thing that we haven't talked about a lot
[09:05.070 --> 09:09.650]  in the podcast space, which is called the critical period.
[09:09.650 --> 09:12.470]  Critical period is also a trait within the plant.
[09:12.470 --> 09:13.310]  I agree with you.
[09:13.310 --> 09:15.670]  I believe, I think that you are correct
[09:15.670 --> 09:17.670]  that what is known as the critical period
[09:17.670 --> 09:19.690]  is a trait for each plant.
[09:19.690 --> 09:21.770]  And what my friend is talking about
[09:21.770 --> 09:23.950]  is when we put some plants outside,
[09:23.950 --> 09:26.970]  they will flower sooner than other plants put outside.
[09:26.970 --> 09:28.770]  If you put a heavy indica plant
[09:28.770 --> 09:30.610]  and a heavy sativa plant outside,
[09:30.610 --> 09:33.170]  they will begin to flower at different times
[09:33.170 --> 09:36.690]  because those plants are from different parts of the world.
[09:36.690 --> 09:39.410]  So in one part of the world, they had more light.
[09:39.410 --> 09:41.110]  In the other part of the world, it got dark sooner,
[09:41.110 --> 09:44.210]  and those plants just adapted to that environment.
[09:44.210 --> 09:45.210]  Evolution did that.
[09:45.210 --> 09:47.630]  That was just years and years of evolution of the plant.
[09:48.470 --> 09:50.090]  Maybe it was breeding, maybe it was evolution.
[09:50.090 --> 09:51.930]  That's why we've got auto flower plants.
[09:51.930 --> 09:53.450]  Auto flowers naturally happened.
[09:53.450 --> 09:55.330]  If you think about in Alaska,
[09:55.330 --> 09:57.290]  there are time periods for months and months and months
[09:57.290 --> 09:59.570]  where they don't get dark, but these plants are growing.
[09:59.570 --> 10:00.890]  And the plants finally said,
[10:00.890 --> 10:02.650]  hey, I'm just gonna fucking flower.
[10:02.650 --> 10:04.090]  You're not gonna give me any dark time.
[10:04.090 --> 10:04.990]  I'm just gonna flower.
[10:04.990 --> 10:06.410]  I'm tired of growing.
[10:07.250 --> 10:09.950]  A cannabis plant's main goal is to reproduce.
[10:09.950 --> 10:11.710]  The main goal of our cannabis plant,
[10:11.710 --> 10:14.450]  it's goal, not our goal, we prevent this from happening.
[10:14.450 --> 10:17.590]  The cannabis plant's main goal is to produce a seed,
[10:18.430 --> 10:19.270]  drop that seed into the ground
[10:19.270 --> 10:21.330]  to continue its generation next year,
[10:21.330 --> 10:24.090]  its life next year, the next filial generation.
[10:24.090 --> 10:25.410]  We interrupt that process
[10:25.410 --> 10:26.710]  by pulling all the males out there.
[10:26.710 --> 10:27.970]  We don't allow the pollination.
[10:27.970 --> 10:29.730]  We don't allow the seeds to happen.
[10:29.730 --> 10:32.790]  But a cannabis plant's main goal is to get pollinated.
[10:32.790 --> 10:34.650]  The female's main goal is to get pollinated.
[10:34.650 --> 10:37.810]  The male's main goal is to shoot that pollen.
[10:37.810 --> 10:39.390]  Just like people, one of our main goals
[10:39.390 --> 10:40.550]  is to fucking procreate.
[10:40.550 --> 10:43.490]  That plant will do everything it can to procreate.
[10:43.490 --> 10:46.430]  Like they say in Jurassic Park, life will find a way.
[10:46.450 --> 10:47.570]  Life does find a way.
[10:47.570 --> 10:48.890]  So we had these plants in Alaska.
[10:48.890 --> 10:51.250]  Now we, they, them, somebody,
[10:51.250 --> 10:52.710]  there were plants in Alaska.
[10:52.710 --> 10:53.970]  They were growing.
[10:53.970 --> 10:54.890]  It never got dark.
[10:54.890 --> 10:57.130]  These plants went, hey, it's not gonna get dark.
[10:57.130 --> 10:57.970]  You want to flower?
[10:57.970 --> 10:58.790]  And they had a meeting
[10:58.790 --> 10:59.930]  and they just fucking decided to flower.
[10:59.930 --> 11:02.050]  And through years and years of evolution,
[11:02.050 --> 11:04.250]  those plants just learned that it's not gonna get dark.
[11:04.250 --> 11:05.650]  We gotta do it on our own.
[11:05.650 --> 11:07.370]  That's how we got auto flower plants.
[11:07.370 --> 11:08.890]  So that is a trait.
[11:08.890 --> 11:11.210]  All of our cannabis plants have a similar trait,
[11:11.210 --> 11:14.510]  which is known, I'm circling back, as the critical period.
[11:14.510 --> 11:17.130]  What am I talking about the critical period?
[11:17.130 --> 11:21.730]  The critical period is the amount of continuous dark hours
[11:21.730 --> 11:23.610]  that it would take to trigger our plant
[11:23.610 --> 11:25.850]  into a flowering phase.
[11:25.850 --> 11:27.970]  Now, most of us are gonna say that's 12 hours, right?
[11:27.970 --> 11:32.570]  Well, kinda, but the plants weren't naturally doing
[11:32.570 --> 11:34.970]  12 hours of darkness and they would flower.
[11:34.970 --> 11:36.550]  That's what we're doing indoors
[11:36.550 --> 11:39.810]  because that's what worked with the equipment that we had,
[11:39.810 --> 11:41.370]  the lights we were working with,
[11:41.370 --> 11:43.310]  the plants that we happen to have.
[11:43.330 --> 11:46.850]  Our forefathers, my uncles, maybe my uncle's uncles,
[11:46.850 --> 11:49.290]  probably my uncles, were the guys responsible
[11:49.290 --> 11:51.170]  for selecting all of those plants.
[11:51.170 --> 11:53.850]  And they realized we've gotta force them to flower
[11:53.850 --> 11:55.330]  by putting them in darkness.
[11:55.330 --> 11:56.890]  So they probably just reduced the light.
[11:56.890 --> 11:58.130]  They're like, well, let's give it four hours.
[11:58.130 --> 11:58.970]  It never flowered.
[11:58.970 --> 11:59.890]  They gave it six, it didn't flower.
[11:59.890 --> 12:01.930]  Eventually somebody realized when I give it 12,
[12:01.930 --> 12:04.050]  it flowers every time.
[12:04.050 --> 12:06.670]  Now, did we select plants that flower under that?
[12:06.670 --> 12:07.690]  Did we breed at that?
[12:07.690 --> 12:09.810]  Or is that a natural thing?
[12:09.810 --> 12:11.390]  So these plants, if we leave them outdoors,
[12:11.390 --> 12:12.790]  this is where this is going.
[12:13.170 --> 12:15.090]  If we put these plants outdoors,
[12:15.090 --> 12:17.290]  the plants are going to flower at different times.
[12:17.290 --> 12:19.570]  That would happen, you'll see it happen naturally indoors,
[12:19.570 --> 12:22.250]  but it's not as drastic because we've bred these plants
[12:22.250 --> 12:25.090]  to all be grown indoors under these indoor conditions.
[12:25.090 --> 12:27.890]  And we've kind of bred the plants to work with the rooms.
[12:27.890 --> 12:30.170]  Now we don't make the rooms work for the plants.
[12:30.170 --> 12:32.410]  We've got so many varieties and so many different things
[12:32.410 --> 12:33.810]  in the room that we're breeding the plants
[12:33.810 --> 12:34.670]  to work for the rooms.
[12:34.670 --> 12:38.010]  We need the plants to work in 74 to 84 degrees
[12:38.010 --> 12:39.690]  with like 30 to 70% humidity.
[12:39.690 --> 12:40.530]  I know it's a huge range,
[12:40.530 --> 12:41.690]  but that's what we're breeding them for,
[12:41.690 --> 12:43.310]  to work in those environments.
[12:43.310 --> 12:45.790]  So something that naturally happens with the plants
[12:45.790 --> 12:49.490]  is outdoors, and all of the plants, indoors and outdoors.
[12:49.490 --> 12:51.130]  You'll see it indoors not as drastically.
[12:51.130 --> 12:53.110]  If you put a strong indica and a strong sativa
[12:53.110 --> 12:55.950]  next to each other and put them on 12-12 lighting,
[12:55.950 --> 12:57.510]  they will flower at different rates.
[12:57.510 --> 12:59.550]  You'll notice the indica plant kicks into flower
[12:59.550 --> 13:00.690]  a little bit sooner.
[13:00.690 --> 13:02.430]  That sativa plant takes a little bit longer
[13:02.430 --> 13:05.310]  to kick into flower, but once it does, it really gets going.
[13:05.310 --> 13:07.030]  Then it takes 16 weeks to finish.
[13:07.030 --> 13:09.630]  That indica plant will be done eight or nine weeks.
[13:09.630 --> 13:11.390]  That's a trait, and that is a critical,
[13:12.090 --> 13:12.930]  what's called the critical period,
[13:12.930 --> 13:14.250]  the amount of darkness which it takes
[13:14.250 --> 13:16.650]  to trigger that plant into flower.
[13:16.650 --> 13:19.330]  Some plants will go into flower with 13 hours of darkness.
[13:19.330 --> 13:22.450]  DJ Short teaches us to do 11 on 13 off.
[13:22.450 --> 13:26.110]  Some plants will go into flower with 14 hours of darkness.
[13:26.110 --> 13:28.130]  Some of them will go with 10.
[13:28.130 --> 13:29.490]  Just, we've done all the breeding
[13:29.490 --> 13:32.210]  to where most of the plants work with 12-12.
[13:32.210 --> 13:35.510]  Also, they'll work with 11-13 either direction.
[13:35.510 --> 13:37.290]  Now, let's talk about outdoors.
[13:37.290 --> 13:40.190]  Outdoors, we have some anomalies.
[13:40.190 --> 13:41.450]  We've all noticed this.
[13:41.450 --> 13:43.650]  We look outside, we got our clock, we got our timer,
[13:43.650 --> 13:45.550]  we got our watch, we see the sun come up.
[13:45.550 --> 13:46.490]  It was seven o'clock.
[13:46.490 --> 13:48.210]  We see the sun go down, it's 8.30.
[13:48.210 --> 13:50.450]  We're obviously getting more than 12 hours
[13:50.450 --> 13:51.290]  of daylight outside.
[13:51.290 --> 13:53.130]  We're getting 14 or 15 hours,
[13:53.130 --> 13:54.770]  so it is safe to put our plants out there.
[13:54.770 --> 13:56.570]  A lot of people move the plants out there.
[13:56.570 --> 13:57.490]  They think it's warm enough.
[13:57.490 --> 13:59.570]  If you're in Colorado, wait a little longer.
[13:59.570 --> 14:00.410]  It's gonna hail on you.
[14:00.410 --> 14:01.810]  You're gonna get your plants beat to shit.
[14:01.810 --> 14:03.330]  A lot of people are gonna go out early.
[14:03.330 --> 14:04.610]  That's what's gonna happen.
[14:04.610 --> 14:06.930]  They're gonna say, I've got 14 hours of daylight.
[14:06.930 --> 14:08.930]  After those plants are outside for a few days,
[14:08.950 --> 14:10.470]  they are going to begin to flower
[14:10.470 --> 14:12.670]  and people are going to be very confused.
[14:12.670 --> 14:14.210]  There are a few things that are happening here.
[14:14.210 --> 14:16.570]  First of all, you just went from an 18-6
[14:16.570 --> 14:18.930]  or a 24-hour light cycle straight outside
[14:18.930 --> 14:19.770]  to less lighting.
[14:19.770 --> 14:20.710]  The plants are confused.
[14:20.710 --> 14:21.950]  They're gonna go into flower.
[14:21.950 --> 14:23.830]  Kind of stressed them out, kind of shocked them.
[14:23.830 --> 14:24.670]  They're flowering.
[14:24.670 --> 14:26.830]  That's just how they want to survive.
[14:26.830 --> 14:28.190]  They're going, something's wrong.
[14:28.190 --> 14:29.070]  We better flower.
[14:29.070 --> 14:31.070]  Like, they just wanna procreate before the end of the world.
[14:31.070 --> 14:32.430]  They think the world might end.
[14:32.430 --> 14:34.270]  They're just trying to get pregnant
[14:34.270 --> 14:37.290]  or make something pregnant at that very last opportunity.
[14:37.290 --> 14:39.270]  So that is why they start flowering possibly.
[14:39.270 --> 14:40.870]  You just went from that indoor light cycle
[14:40.870 --> 14:41.910]  to the outdoor light cycle.
[14:41.910 --> 14:43.670]  It's so different, they freaked out.
[14:43.670 --> 14:45.710]  Here's another thing that is happening.
[14:45.710 --> 14:48.190]  We are thinking we're getting 14 hours of light.
[14:48.190 --> 14:52.150]  However, when the sun sets, as the sun begins to set,
[14:52.150 --> 14:53.770]  you may see this with your eye.
[14:53.770 --> 14:55.470]  You may not see this with your eye.
[14:55.470 --> 14:58.390]  You may notice that the sky gets a little bit orange,
[14:58.390 --> 15:00.750]  a little bit red as the sun sets.
[15:00.750 --> 15:03.630]  So as the sun sets, it puts off a red spectrum,
[15:03.630 --> 15:06.110]  which is known as far red.
[15:06.130 --> 15:08.170]  And that spectrum tells the plants,
[15:08.170 --> 15:09.670]  it is time to go to sleep.
[15:09.670 --> 15:11.730]  That triggers something within the plant
[15:11.730 --> 15:13.370]  called phytochrome red.
[15:13.370 --> 15:15.850]  And that phytochrome red is basically
[15:15.850 --> 15:19.330]  the way that the far red and phytochrome work together.
[15:19.330 --> 15:20.970]  When they touch, that is basically
[15:20.970 --> 15:22.970]  NyQuil or Ambien for your plants.
[15:22.970 --> 15:24.370]  It goes, night, night, bitches.
[15:24.370 --> 15:26.150]  And they go, oh, look, far red.
[15:26.150 --> 15:27.250]  Let's trigger phytochrome.
[15:27.250 --> 15:28.330]  And then they go to sleep.
[15:28.330 --> 15:29.990]  It just puts the plants to sleep.
[15:29.990 --> 15:31.690]  So that triggers them to go to sleep
[15:31.690 --> 15:34.390]  earlier than when that darkness happens.
[15:34.390 --> 15:36.290]  In the indoor grow, unless you've got
[15:36.290 --> 15:38.010]  one of those new lights with the far red lighting,
[15:38.010 --> 15:40.130]  which they just started adding a couple of years ago,
[15:40.130 --> 15:41.210]  big up to that.
[15:41.210 --> 15:45.070]  But until then, we did not have far red lighting indoors.
[15:45.070 --> 15:46.970]  So we had to turn off the light.
[15:46.970 --> 15:48.730]  And at that point, the plants were not asleep.
[15:48.730 --> 15:50.230]  It takes them an hour or two
[15:50.230 --> 15:52.250]  to actually fall asleep completely
[15:52.250 --> 15:54.210]  and begin their dark cycle.
[15:54.210 --> 15:56.990]  The night cycle process takes a little bit to kick in.
[15:56.990 --> 15:59.890]  So they couldn't kick that in until an hour or two
[15:59.890 --> 16:02.130]  after we actually put them to sleep.
[16:02.130 --> 16:03.270]  Okay, I do apologize.
[16:03.290 --> 16:04.890]  I was interrupted by a delivery.
[16:04.890 --> 16:06.170]  I am back on track now.
[16:06.170 --> 16:08.170]  I do not remember where I was.
[16:08.170 --> 16:10.250]  I know I was talking about phytochrome red.
[16:10.250 --> 16:11.890]  I was talking about the different plants
[16:11.890 --> 16:13.410]  going into flower at different rates.
[16:13.410 --> 16:14.290]  I'm not exactly sure.
[16:14.290 --> 16:16.610]  So we're gonna jump in right here.
[16:16.610 --> 16:18.010]  A lot of people are growing sativas.
[16:18.010 --> 16:19.250]  A lot of people are growing indicas.
[16:19.250 --> 16:22.330]  Most people are growing straight hybrids at this point.
[16:22.330 --> 16:25.410]  Most of your sativas are gonna take 16 weeks-ish
[16:25.410 --> 16:27.130]  to finish out, if they're real.
[16:27.130 --> 16:28.710]  That's what I mean by a sativa.
[16:28.710 --> 16:30.510]  Most of your indica stuff is your eight or nine,
[16:30.510 --> 16:33.150]  maybe the 10-weeker stuff with that big fat leaf.
[16:33.990 --> 16:34.830]  That's the indica stuff.
[16:34.830 --> 16:36.410]  You're gonna notice that some of those plants
[16:36.410 --> 16:38.470]  will go into flower earlier outdoors
[16:38.470 --> 16:40.730]  and some will go into flower later outdoors.
[16:40.730 --> 16:42.490]  That is called the critical period.
[16:42.490 --> 16:43.810]  You've gotta get that critical period
[16:43.810 --> 16:46.410]  of the right amount of darkness for each plant.
[16:46.410 --> 16:49.790]  And that's gonna be dependent on where that plant came from.
[16:49.790 --> 16:51.310]  Where did the parent plants come from?
[16:51.310 --> 16:53.970]  Which part of the world did that plant start from?
[16:53.970 --> 16:55.490]  Now with all the breeding,
[16:55.490 --> 16:56.650]  you've got plants that are,
[16:56.650 --> 16:58.330]  they got parents from all over the place.
[16:58.330 --> 17:01.330]  So it just kinda depends on which phenotype it leans toward.
[17:01.330 --> 17:02.170]  I do have some notes.
[17:02.170 --> 17:04.110]  I wanna make sure I get onto all my notes here
[17:04.110 --> 17:05.810]  because I haven't looked at my notes at all.
[17:05.810 --> 17:07.870]  I've just been talking off the top of my head.
[17:07.870 --> 17:11.490]  What we're talking about here is the critical period.
[17:11.490 --> 17:14.750]  This could be very different between different phenotypes.
[17:14.750 --> 17:17.150]  If you've got a pack of seeds and you put them outside,
[17:17.150 --> 17:19.510]  one may flower much earlier than the other.
[17:19.510 --> 17:20.970]  That is just different phenotypes.
[17:20.970 --> 17:22.430]  That is expression.
[17:22.430 --> 17:25.350]  That's all about the genetic location
[17:25.350 --> 17:26.770]  and origin of that plant.
[17:26.770 --> 17:27.870]  That's what I was just talking about.
[17:27.870 --> 17:29.710]  Where did that plant come from?
[17:29.710 --> 17:32.070]  If you've got a plant that came from Alaska,
[17:32.850 --> 17:33.690]  it may auto flower on you.
[17:33.690 --> 17:35.650]  Some plants may flower as soon as you give them
[17:35.650 --> 17:36.770]  a little bit of darkness.
[17:36.770 --> 17:39.570]  Some may need a lot more darkness to trigger into flower.
[17:39.570 --> 17:40.770]  That's just gonna be genetics.
[17:40.770 --> 17:43.050]  That's just like a lot of other parts of our plants.
[17:43.050 --> 17:44.650]  Sometimes the plants want more CalMag.
[17:44.650 --> 17:46.210]  Sometimes they want more nitrogen.
[17:46.210 --> 17:49.310]  Sometimes they need more dark, period.
[17:49.310 --> 17:51.310]  That's how we've got auto flower plants.
[17:51.310 --> 17:53.130]  I touched on that at the beginning.
[17:53.130 --> 17:55.510]  They're auto flower plants because up in Alaska,
[17:55.510 --> 17:57.010]  it just wasn't getting dark.
[17:57.010 --> 17:59.810]  Up there in certain parts of Russia, it wasn't getting dark.
[17:59.810 --> 18:00.650]  So the plants were just like,
[18:00.650 --> 18:02.310]  hey, we gotta do something, dude.
[18:02.310 --> 18:04.270]  Or we're just not gonna be able to get to the party.
[18:04.270 --> 18:06.670]  And they wanted to party just like we all do.
[18:06.670 --> 18:09.470]  We chose 12-12 because that seems to be
[18:09.470 --> 18:11.350]  what works for most plants.
[18:11.350 --> 18:12.510]  Like I touched on a minute ago,
[18:12.510 --> 18:14.870]  you can do 11-13 either direction.
[18:14.870 --> 18:17.730]  11 on, 11 off, 13 on, 13 off.
[18:17.730 --> 18:19.550]  As long as you got a 24-hour light cycle right there,
[18:19.550 --> 18:21.090]  you could do 11-13.
[18:21.090 --> 18:23.790]  I've seen 10-14 both directions.
[18:23.790 --> 18:25.590]  It's all about trying it with your plants
[18:25.590 --> 18:27.550]  and what works best for your plants.
[18:27.550 --> 18:29.350]  You guys, you've heard me talk about switching
[18:29.350 --> 18:31.730]  my light cycle to 18-6 at the end.
[18:31.730 --> 18:32.770]  Don't be afraid.
[18:33.670 --> 18:35.730]  A lot of people think that when I talk about
[18:35.730 --> 18:37.010]  experimenting with my plants,
[18:37.010 --> 18:40.170]  I'm talking about doing this in like a 25 by 25 room
[18:40.170 --> 18:41.970]  with fucking 25 lights in there.
[18:41.970 --> 18:42.850]  That's not how I do it.
[18:42.850 --> 18:43.850]  When I'm doing experiments,
[18:43.850 --> 18:45.370]  I do it in a little teeny tiny space
[18:45.370 --> 18:47.970]  where I can't ruin a whole bunch of shit at one time.
[18:47.970 --> 18:49.930]  So get one light and a few plants
[18:49.930 --> 18:51.650]  and just experiment with those.
[18:51.650 --> 18:52.630]  We're not gonna get better.
[18:52.630 --> 18:53.730]  We're not gonna learn anything.
[18:53.730 --> 18:55.530]  We're not gonna advance, improve.
[18:56.610 --> 18:59.090]  If we don't practice, try and fail.
[18:59.830 --> 19:01.470]  You've got to have some failures and some successes
[19:01.470 --> 19:02.870]  to become better at anything.
[19:02.870 --> 19:04.950]  If it's growing weed, if it's skateboarding,
[19:04.950 --> 19:07.670]  if it's playing music, if it's karate, if it's ballet,
[19:07.670 --> 19:10.310]  whatever you're doing, you've got to fail a couple of times.
[19:10.310 --> 19:11.590]  I gotta learn everything the hard way.
[19:11.590 --> 19:13.350]  If you don't have some failures,
[19:13.350 --> 19:14.670]  you're not going to learn anything.
[19:14.670 --> 19:17.830]  Do a lot of experiments, try a lot, take a lot of notes,
[19:17.830 --> 19:19.410]  but don't do it in your big space.
[19:19.410 --> 19:22.490]  Do that all in a small space and a small practice area.
[19:22.490 --> 19:24.430]  If you don't practice, if you don't try new shit,
[19:24.430 --> 19:25.590]  you're not gonna learn anything.
[19:25.590 --> 19:27.110]  You've got to fail occasionally.
[19:27.110 --> 19:28.650]  I've done full podcast episodes
[19:28.650 --> 19:30.330]  about mistakes that I've made.
[19:30.330 --> 19:31.670]  Don't be afraid to make some mistakes.
[19:31.670 --> 19:33.110]  All right, there is more to this.
[19:33.110 --> 19:35.850]  I do think that as lighting and equipment evolves,
[19:35.850 --> 19:38.650]  I think that light cycles will evolve as well.
[19:38.650 --> 19:41.250]  I've seen other people playing with different light cycles.
[19:41.250 --> 19:44.230]  Since we're getting the proper light, the proper spectrum,
[19:44.230 --> 19:46.130]  we've got far-red lighting, we've got all,
[19:46.130 --> 19:48.450]  we can cover just about any color of lighting.
[19:48.450 --> 19:50.650]  We can replicate it, any color spectrum.
[19:50.650 --> 19:52.890]  We can make that with expensive lighting
[19:52.890 --> 19:54.070]  or affordable lighting.
[19:54.070 --> 19:55.790]  I think as the lighting evolves,
[19:55.790 --> 19:57.490]  so will some of the schedules.
[19:57.490 --> 19:59.650]  We're able to give the plants all the photons,
[19:59.650 --> 20:01.010]  all the energy that it needs,
[20:01.010 --> 20:03.210]  so that'll let it get more sleeping time
[20:03.210 --> 20:04.490]  because it's getting the DLI,
[20:04.490 --> 20:06.350]  which I need to do a podcast about DLI,
[20:06.350 --> 20:08.330]  but that's, there's some equations to be done
[20:08.330 --> 20:09.810]  that I don't understand all the math,
[20:09.810 --> 20:12.010]  but I know what it means, if that makes any sense.
[20:12.010 --> 20:13.390]  But with the technology,
[20:13.390 --> 20:15.290]  the plants will be getting their DLI,
[20:15.290 --> 20:17.050]  which means we'll be able to give them
[20:17.050 --> 20:19.450]  maybe longer sleep periods.
[20:19.450 --> 20:20.570]  Who knows how it'll work out,
[20:20.570 --> 20:21.910]  but we're gonna learn a lot more
[20:21.910 --> 20:23.450]  with the evolution of technology.
[20:23.450 --> 20:25.590]  I did say that a lot of the gear we have,
[20:26.330 --> 20:27.170]  a lot of the plants we have,
[20:27.170 --> 20:28.130]  a lot of the selections we have now
[20:28.130 --> 20:30.090]  are because of our forefathers
[20:30.090 --> 20:31.810]  who did not have the best technology.
[20:31.810 --> 20:32.690]  They didn't have the internet,
[20:32.690 --> 20:33.610]  they didn't have PAR meters,
[20:33.610 --> 20:35.210]  they didn't have LED lighting.
[20:35.210 --> 20:36.730]  We've come so far,
[20:36.730 --> 20:38.530]  and also they didn't have legalization.
[20:38.530 --> 20:40.470]  We've got legalization on our side.
[20:40.470 --> 20:42.010]  They couldn't even talk about growing weed.
[20:42.010 --> 20:43.230]  If they're gonna grow weed,
[20:43.230 --> 20:44.890]  they didn't have the internet to do research,
[20:44.890 --> 20:46.650]  they didn't have a bro to talk about it.
[20:46.650 --> 20:48.770]  They just had to do it and hope not to get busted
[20:48.770 --> 20:50.290]  and see how it goes and try again.
[20:50.290 --> 20:51.890]  They were learning it all from scratch.
[20:51.890 --> 20:53.410]  We're a little spoiled now.
[20:53.410 --> 20:55.530]  I like to say we're blessed, we're cheating.
[20:56.310 --> 20:57.150]  Back in the day, you had to be secretive,
[20:57.150 --> 20:58.270]  you didn't have the internet,
[20:58.270 --> 21:00.110]  and it was not legal at all.
[21:00.110 --> 21:01.390]  Now we got the fucking internet,
[21:01.390 --> 21:03.310]  and it's legal, we are cheating.
[21:03.310 --> 21:05.510]  But I think there will be a lot of evolution
[21:05.510 --> 21:08.150]  in the technology, in the growing, in light cycles,
[21:08.150 --> 21:11.390]  now that we've got more technology and legalization
[21:11.390 --> 21:13.190]  and the internet on our side.
[21:13.190 --> 21:15.630]  I think I've covered up all of my notes.
[21:15.630 --> 21:18.430]  I talked about FAR-RED, I talked about Phytochrome-RED.
[21:18.430 --> 21:20.830]  I said that's basically plant sleeping pills.
[21:20.830 --> 21:23.270]  Let's talk about the opposite end of that spectrum.
[21:23.290 --> 21:27.730]  In the morning, the sun puts off a bluish-colored light,
[21:27.730 --> 21:29.150]  and guess what that one does?
[21:29.150 --> 21:30.390]  That works like an alarm clock.
[21:30.390 --> 21:32.850]  It says, wake up, bitches, it is time to get moving,
[21:32.850 --> 21:33.890]  and it wakes up all your plants,
[21:33.890 --> 21:35.490]  and they get the day started.
[21:35.490 --> 21:37.970]  That is the blue light that comes from the sunrise.
[21:37.970 --> 21:41.450]  So you get the blue in the sunrise, the red in the sunset.
[21:41.450 --> 21:44.390]  That dictates a lot of the plant's movement and actions
[21:44.390 --> 21:45.890]  through the rest of the day.
[21:45.890 --> 21:47.670]  All right, I think that is all I've got for you
[21:47.670 --> 21:50.030]  for my question about critical period.
[21:50.030 --> 21:52.290]  I know I skipped a lot of this question.
[21:52.470 --> 21:54.430]  I just used it kind of as a springboard.
[21:54.430 --> 21:57.710]  Big shout out to my friend, where did he say his name?
[21:57.710 --> 21:59.430]  Oh, his name is Taj.
[21:59.430 --> 22:00.830]  Big shout out to my buddy Taj.
[22:00.830 --> 22:03.170]  I do appreciate the great message, the great content.
[22:03.170 --> 22:04.010]  Thank you.
[22:04.010 --> 22:05.310]  If you've got any follow-ups, any questions,
[22:05.310 --> 22:06.910]  corrections, comments, or concerns,
[22:06.910 --> 22:08.030]  you know I would love to hear from you.
[22:08.030 --> 22:10.110]  Everybody out there, my email address is
[22:10.110 --> 22:12.070]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[22:12.070 --> 22:12.950]  Don't be shy.
[22:12.950 --> 22:15.510]  Send me your questions, corrections, comments, concerns,
[22:15.510 --> 22:18.150]  positive feedback, I'd love to hear all of that stuff.
[22:18.150 --> 22:19.790]  Also, make sure you check out the website
[22:19.790 --> 22:21.830]  at iRegenetics.com.
[22:21.850 --> 22:23.890]  There's a link to the new and improved
[22:23.890 --> 22:26.090]  and updated Discord server on there.
[22:26.090 --> 22:28.410]  I do invite you to join the new Discord server.
[22:28.410 --> 22:30.510]  If you were on the old Discord,
[22:30.510 --> 22:32.490]  some things went haywire on there.
[22:32.490 --> 22:35.770]  That server has been, it's no longer an iRegenetics server.
[22:35.770 --> 22:37.610]  It might be running as a different server.
[22:37.610 --> 22:38.970]  I am not involved in that.
[22:38.970 --> 22:40.170]  That is not me.
[22:40.170 --> 22:42.010]  Join my new real server.
[22:42.010 --> 22:43.850]  There's a link in the show notes
[22:43.850 --> 22:46.250]  and in the video description.
[22:46.250 --> 22:47.890]  All right, I think that is all I've got for you
[22:47.890 --> 22:48.890]  for this episode.
[22:48.890 --> 22:51.490]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[22:52.150 --> 22:54.230]  I wanna give a giant shout out to my friend, James Bean.
[22:54.230 --> 22:56.470]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[22:56.470 --> 22:57.970]  and give your mom a hug for me.
