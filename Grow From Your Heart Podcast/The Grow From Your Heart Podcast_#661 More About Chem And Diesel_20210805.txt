[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:11.920 --> 00:18.960]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 661 of the Grow From Your
[00:18.960 --> 00:19.960]  Heart podcast.
[00:19.960 --> 00:24.400]  In this episode, I'm going to do a bit of a correction, maybe a recap from a previous
[00:24.400 --> 00:25.400]  episode.
[00:25.400 --> 00:29.640]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:29.800 --> 00:32.440]  who support the show on Patreon.
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.880]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:34.880 --> 00:35.880]  Thank you.
[00:35.880 --> 00:36.880]  Shout out to my friend Stoner Dave.
[00:36.880 --> 00:39.880]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Godfather Kush.
[00:39.880 --> 00:42.480]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Justa Smokin.
[00:42.480 --> 00:46.520]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Root305 and Noah N.
[00:46.520 --> 00:49.080]  Let's send a thank you to Big Sexy Dank.
[00:49.080 --> 00:53.320]  I want to send a big fist bump to a longtime supporter, Nomi by my guacamole.
[00:53.320 --> 00:57.260]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Paul F. and Grow Man Stan.
[00:57.260 --> 01:00.980]  I want to send a big fist bump to a fellow podcaster, Justin Klosser.
[01:00.980 --> 01:04.820]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:04.820 --> 01:07.360]  to my friend Rasta Green Thumb.
[01:07.360 --> 01:12.300]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:12.300 --> 01:15.940]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:15.940 --> 01:22.340]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:22.340 --> 01:24.740]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:24.740 --> 01:28.980]  And of course there is a link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:28.980 --> 01:31.440]  nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:31.440 --> 01:34.260]  You know the routine if you're driving, if you're working, if you're trimming, if you're
[01:34.260 --> 01:36.360]  cooking don't get yourself in trouble.
[01:36.360 --> 01:37.420]  Don't get burned.
[01:37.420 --> 01:38.480]  Don't get in a wreck.
[01:38.480 --> 01:41.060]  That link will be there when you are ready.
[01:41.060 --> 01:45.140]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:45.140 --> 01:49.340]  If you've been watching the show you know I've been encouraging people to join the discord
[01:49.340 --> 01:54.380]  channel by the time this episode comes out we should be close to 1000 members on the
[01:54.520 --> 01:57.700]  IryArmy grow from your heart discord channel.
[01:57.700 --> 02:01.420]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who runs that discord over there.
[02:01.420 --> 02:05.120]  They keep telling me they don't need praise and love and thanks that they've gotten enough
[02:05.120 --> 02:06.780]  but I do appreciate it.
[02:06.780 --> 02:10.540]  So big thanks to everybody who makes that happen, who keeps the community flowing.
[02:10.540 --> 02:12.300]  I do appreciate it.
[02:12.300 --> 02:17.420]  I am looking to get the 1000 member mark so we can do some giveaways and some prizes and
[02:17.420 --> 02:19.940]  some contests over there on the discord.
[02:19.940 --> 02:23.880]  Once we've got 1000 members we will be giving away prize packages.
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.720]  There will be contests, photo contests, other contests, other giveaways and many more shenanigans
[02:29.720 --> 02:31.960]  are to come on the discord channel.
[02:31.960 --> 02:33.040]  I do like the discord.
[02:33.040 --> 02:36.280]  It's really a good way for us to get away from social media.
[02:36.280 --> 02:39.920]  We're kind of reliant on the other social media companies who have a lot of control
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.840]  over what we can and cannot post and can and cannot say.
[02:43.840 --> 02:47.400]  Especially being a cannabis brand they do like to censor some of the content that I
[02:47.400 --> 02:53.280]  post and I do fear that some of my posts and my accounts will be removed by some social
[02:53.280 --> 02:54.280]  media brands.
[02:54.280 --> 02:55.280]  Big shout out to Cannabuzz.
[02:55.280 --> 02:57.520]  I know Cannabuzz will never remove my content.
[02:57.520 --> 02:58.720]  Big thank you for that.
[02:58.720 --> 03:02.840]  Some of the other content providers, the places where we can share social media content, they
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.920]  may remove our cannabis content.
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.000]  I do appreciate the discord because it is kind of a middle ground between my website
[03:10.000 --> 03:11.500]  and social media.
[03:11.500 --> 03:14.840]  The website I like to keep it kind of professional, kind of business-y.
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.840]  There's not a chat there.
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.080]  There's not a forum there.
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.880]  It's just a place for me to put the business stuff and the thing about that is I don't
[03:21.880 --> 03:22.880]  know.
[03:22.880 --> 03:23.880]  I could learn how to do it.
[03:23.880 --> 03:25.440]  I don't update the website myself.
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.440]  I don't do the updates.
[03:26.440 --> 03:28.480]  I don't do the website commands and programming.
[03:28.480 --> 03:30.080]  None of that is me.
[03:30.080 --> 03:31.160]  That's another guy that does that.
[03:31.160 --> 03:32.160]  Big shout out, bro.
[03:32.160 --> 03:33.160]  Thank you.
[03:33.160 --> 03:34.160]  You do a great job.
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.480]  I rely on you and you do a wonderful job at that, but that is not my zone.
[03:36.480 --> 03:37.600]  I don't have time to do that.
[03:37.600 --> 03:40.880]  What I love about the discord is I can post real-time updates.
[03:40.880 --> 03:42.520]  I can answer questions in real-time.
[03:42.520 --> 03:46.440]  If there's something I want to do in real-time, I can manage that on discord.
[03:46.440 --> 03:51.640]  So it's a really nice go-between in my opinion between social media and between the website.
[03:52.400 --> 03:53.400]  I can manage it.
[03:53.400 --> 03:54.400]  I can edit it.
[03:54.400 --> 03:57.320]  I can do things on the fly and I know they're not going to edit me or censor me like they
[03:57.320 --> 03:59.040]  do quite often on social media.
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.000]  So that's the long way of saying, come join us on the discord.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  You're welcome.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  You're invited.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.240]  There is a link in the show notes and in the video description.
[04:07.240 --> 04:10.800]  I've realized that sometimes the link I was using may have been a link that expired.
[04:10.800 --> 04:13.000]  I have corrected and edited that.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.680]  There will be a current link, a valid link in the video description and in the show notes.
[04:18.680 --> 04:20.640]  In some servers, the show notes don't pop up.
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.440]  I've noticed that some of the places where you get the audio feed, the show notes don't
[04:24.440 --> 04:26.240]  pop up the way they should.
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.040]  You may have to go to YouTube, find the link to get to the discord.
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.240]  It's just a couple of clicks away.
[04:31.240 --> 04:32.720]  Don't worry, we'll get you there.
[04:32.720 --> 04:34.280]  But join us on the discord.
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.600]  Look forward to some giveaways.
[04:35.600 --> 04:37.240]  I just pop in and hang out in the chat.
[04:37.240 --> 04:38.960]  I'm in the video chat at least once a week.
[04:38.960 --> 04:41.400]  I'm in there just chatting with the crew.
[04:41.400 --> 04:44.240]  Dave does some auctions and other things like that.
[04:44.240 --> 04:45.240]  It's a good time.
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.680]  Pop in, join us on discord.
[04:47.680 --> 04:48.680]  Where else do we go?
[04:48.680 --> 04:50.120]  The Etsy store.
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.720]  We have done some updates and some things to the Etsy store.
[04:53.720 --> 04:55.360]  There is a sale happening right now.
[04:55.360 --> 04:59.120]  If you are part of the discord, if you are part of the Patreon, if you are part of the
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.120]  newsletter, you did receive a coupon code.
[05:02.120 --> 05:04.960]  We're doing a lot of things on the Etsy store.
[05:04.960 --> 05:06.200]  Things are flying off the shelves.
[05:06.200 --> 05:07.880]  A lot of packages went out today.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.920]  More packages will go out tomorrow.
[05:09.920 --> 05:14.040]  The goal is to kind of clear out some of the remaining remnants in the Etsy store.
[05:14.040 --> 05:16.880]  I've got a bunch of boxes with like two and three shirts in it.
[05:16.880 --> 05:18.560]  We're going to get rid of those two and three shirts.
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.880]  Once those shirts are gone, I'm going to use that fund, those funds from the Etsy store
[05:22.880 --> 05:25.440]  to restock the shirts that are out of stock.
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.560]  A lot of people want certain sizes.
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.540]  There will be some new merchandise coming, new shirt designs, new merch coming and restock
[05:32.540 --> 05:33.540]  of old stuff soon.
[05:33.540 --> 05:36.160]  If there are sizes you have missed, it is coming.
[05:36.160 --> 05:39.880]  If there's something that you've been looking for, if it's in your size, it's probably on
[05:39.880 --> 05:41.400]  sale right now.
[05:41.400 --> 05:47.120]  Join the newsletter, join the discord, join the Patreon and you will get a coupon code
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.120]  for the Etsy store.
[05:48.680 --> 05:50.600]  If you don't need a coupon code, just go hit it up.
[05:50.600 --> 05:53.240]  Go to the website, the iRegenetics.com website.
[05:53.240 --> 05:55.160]  You'll find the link to the iRestore.
[05:55.160 --> 05:56.320]  The Etsy store is right there.
[05:56.320 --> 05:59.740]  You say, why do you have an Etsy store when you've got a professional website?
[05:59.740 --> 06:01.320]  Because I can edit that on the fly.
[06:01.320 --> 06:03.880]  I can edit that, correct it, adjust it, change all the inventory.
[06:03.880 --> 06:07.680]  I can do everything on the fly really quickly.
[06:07.680 --> 06:08.680]  Super simple for me.
[06:08.680 --> 06:12.200]  I needed to simplify and streamline some things and that was the quickest, easiest way to
[06:12.200 --> 06:13.200]  do it.
[06:13.200 --> 06:17.200]  The merchandise, the non-seed merchandise is available on the Etsy store.
[06:17.280 --> 06:19.760]  I feel like I'm advertising a lot at the start of the show.
[06:19.760 --> 06:22.640]  Let's go a little faster with this part so we can get to the fun part of the show.
[06:22.640 --> 06:25.200]  I've got one more thing I really want to mention.
[06:25.200 --> 06:27.480]  Big shout out to my friends at Chi-Town Seeds.
[06:27.480 --> 06:31.840]  Chi-Town Seeds will be attending the Chicago CannaCon event.
[06:31.840 --> 06:35.580]  If you are listening to this podcast when it comes out, the next day, the Friday and
[06:35.580 --> 06:38.340]  Saturday is the Chicago CannaCon.
[06:38.340 --> 06:40.080]  Go find my friends at Chi-Town Seeds.
[06:40.080 --> 06:41.160]  They do have a booth.
[06:41.160 --> 06:48.560]  They will have Irie Genetics in stock on hand ready to go at the Chicago CannaCon.
[06:48.560 --> 06:51.560]  That's right, Chi-Town Seeds loaded up with plenty of beans.
[06:51.560 --> 06:55.280]  They've got Irie Genetics and plenty of other breeders on hand.
[06:55.280 --> 06:56.280]  Go say what's up.
[06:56.280 --> 06:57.620]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[06:57.620 --> 07:01.480]  If you don't make it to the event, you can still follow Chi-Town Seeds on social media
[07:01.480 --> 07:04.480]  and you can still get your beans from Chi-Town Seeds.
[07:04.480 --> 07:09.920]  They've got a lot of great Irie Genetics and other brands in stock.
[07:09.920 --> 07:14.720]  Let's get into some of the edits, corrections, and updates from a previous episode.
[07:14.720 --> 07:20.440]  I did get two great responses from a couple of things I've said on the podcast.
[07:20.440 --> 07:22.520]  I'm trying to find out which one I want to do first.
[07:22.520 --> 07:28.640]  This may turn into a long podcast, which I think you guys may appreciate, so that's fine.
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.160]  Let's go with ... We'll jump right into the one that I think may go long.
[07:33.160 --> 07:34.160]  Let's do it.
[07:34.160 --> 07:35.160]  Let's jump right into it.
[07:35.160 --> 07:36.960]  This one came from my friend Adam.
[07:36.960 --> 07:38.400]  He signed it with the name Adam.
[07:38.400 --> 07:41.640]  It doesn't say if he wants his name said, but there are a lot of Adams out there and
[07:41.640 --> 07:45.400]  you don't know Adam from Adam, so it could be any Adam.
[07:45.400 --> 07:46.400]  It goes a lot like this.
[07:46.400 --> 07:50.520]  It says, Rasta Jeff, I've been a big fan of yours for a while and I really appreciate
[07:50.520 --> 07:54.720]  the interviews you've done, your strain description videos, and of course, your seeds.
[07:54.720 --> 07:57.800]  I've had the pleasure of growing at least one pack of each of these.
[07:57.800 --> 07:59.280]  Then they list several of my strains.
[07:59.280 --> 08:05.320]  They've got Liberation OG, Strawberry Starburst, Scarlet Begonias, The Cream, and Morning Dew.
[08:05.320 --> 08:06.560]  That's a really nice variety.
[08:06.720 --> 08:09.320]  Then they say, thank you for all of it.
[08:09.320 --> 08:12.360]  Let me wrap up that first paragraph with, bro, thank you.
[08:12.360 --> 08:14.040]  That's a lot of stuff to start off with.
[08:14.040 --> 08:16.840]  You've been listening to the interviews, the strain descriptions, you've been a fan for
[08:16.840 --> 08:19.440]  a while, and you've grown the seeds.
[08:19.440 --> 08:20.440]  You're on the team.
[08:20.440 --> 08:22.400]  You're OG, so that's a great way to start.
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.280]  Now it says, now for the review part.
[08:25.280 --> 08:26.280]  This is where we get critical.
[08:26.280 --> 08:27.280]  No, I enjoy this.
[08:27.280 --> 08:28.280]  I invited this sort of stuff.
[08:28.280 --> 08:33.000]  It says, concerning your recent breeding episodes, I wish you would be a little more technical
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.240]  and accurate about the breeding terminology and definitions.
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.920]  When you were talking about the Scarlet Begonias and East Coast Sour Diesel to Blueberry project,
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.400]  it was kind of a letdown to hear you say, technically it's a polyhybrid, but we'll call
[08:46.400 --> 08:47.880]  it an F1.
[08:47.880 --> 08:53.400]  Yeah, I did touch later on in the episode about how to make a true F1.
[08:53.400 --> 08:58.640]  I didn't want to sidetrack myself too much talking about F1s and polyhybrids in that
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.920]  you know me, it is very easy to sidetrack me and get me talking about some random shit.
[09:04.920 --> 09:08.080]  I was really trying to stay focused on that grow lesson, but you are right.
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.080]  I was right.
[09:09.080 --> 09:12.960]  I said, truly we're fucking with polyhybrids and not F1s.
[09:12.960 --> 09:17.680]  Most of what is being bred, what we are buying, what we're purchasing is probably a polyhybrid,
[09:17.680 --> 09:18.680]  not a true F1.
[09:18.680 --> 09:23.320]  The F2s are getting us closer, if they're even F2s, because if we started ... Anyway,
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.320]  see, that's what I mean.
[09:24.320 --> 09:26.840]  I can get on a good ramble really quickly.
[09:26.840 --> 09:30.040]  I'm going to continue with this, but I do have a nice reply.
[09:30.040 --> 09:33.320]  I enjoy these respectful reviews and criticisms.
[09:33.320 --> 09:36.760]  I am not taking this with any ... There's no salt in my game here.
[09:36.760 --> 09:38.400]  I enjoy this.
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.240]  But it goes on to say, it was kind of a letdown.
[09:40.240 --> 09:45.120]  If you know better, please go into detail about homozygous and heterozygous genotypes
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.200]  and why it matters in the parental stock of true F1 hybrids.
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.400]  I think it would serve the community well to stop calling all the polyhybrids F1s.
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.640]  Very few breeders even talk about finding or creating homozygous lines to be the parents
[09:59.640 --> 10:00.640]  for F1s.
[10:00.640 --> 10:04.280]  I challenge you to geek out hard on breeding for us.
[10:04.280 --> 10:06.120]  All right.
[10:06.120 --> 10:13.080]  I am all up for a challenge of geeking out hard on breeding, but that's not my goal for
[10:13.080 --> 10:14.080]  the podcast.
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.720]  I appreciate your passion and your desire to inspire me to go further with breeding,
[10:18.720 --> 10:21.840]  but that's not really what I'm doing.
[10:21.840 --> 10:24.280]  Let me read my notes and get myself back on track.
[10:24.320 --> 10:25.520]  This is completely correct.
[10:25.520 --> 10:26.680]  What you were saying is correct.
[10:26.680 --> 10:32.320]  It was later on in the episode, I did go down line breeding a little bit to kind of create
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.360]  a more homogenous strain.
[10:36.360 --> 10:41.760]  But in this podcast, my goal isn't really to go that deep into breeding yet.
[10:41.760 --> 10:47.440]  I'm 661 episodes in, and I feel like people are finally getting a good grasp on how to
[10:47.440 --> 10:48.440]  grow.
[10:48.440 --> 10:55.120]  My goal for this podcast is to give you the basics, to get you a good foundation, to be
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.520]  a solid, reliable grower, to understand the plant.
[10:58.520 --> 11:01.040]  I will give in-depth breeding advice.
[11:01.040 --> 11:02.520]  I don't know.
[11:02.520 --> 11:03.920]  Maybe I'm just not ready to do it yet.
[11:03.920 --> 11:05.120]  That's not where the show has evolved.
[11:05.120 --> 11:07.520]  My goal is to get everybody going.
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.320]  There are podcasts that teach much more advanced levels than mine, and there are podcasts that
[11:12.320 --> 11:14.520]  don't teach as advanced as mine.
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.560]  I have no judgment around that, but I think that where my audience is right now, where
[11:18.560 --> 11:23.920]  I'm trying to take my audience, is more to a self-sustainable, self-reliant sort of a
[11:23.920 --> 11:25.520]  growth thing.
[11:25.520 --> 11:29.840]  I feel like a lot of the people that are trying to breed are already reading the books that
[11:29.840 --> 11:32.600]  you're trying to get me to talk about, which is a good thing.
[11:32.600 --> 11:36.440]  I will go there, but I'm not ready to do it, and I don't think that the audience is ready
[11:36.440 --> 11:37.440]  for it yet.
[11:37.440 --> 11:38.880]  No offense to my audience.
[11:38.880 --> 11:40.400]  I feel like I will lose some people.
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.280]  I'll get some people with a notebook taking a lot of notes, but my goal now at this point
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.280]  in time for this podcast, learning this new gear, getting this new setup, right now I'm
[11:49.280 --> 11:51.520]  kind of focused on getting everybody going.
[11:51.520 --> 11:54.640]  I just want to get ... There are so many new states legalizing.
[11:54.640 --> 11:57.960]  There are so many new people learning about cannabis that I just want to make sure everybody's
[11:57.960 --> 12:01.240]  got the prerequisites, the basic skills.
[12:01.240 --> 12:04.280]  I want to be able to drive change lanes in parallel park.
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.800]  Once we can all drive change lanes parallel park, merge properly, then I'll start teaching
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.080]  us how to do fucking turbo tricks and fast turns and shit like that.
[12:14.080 --> 12:15.560]  I just don't want to go there yet.
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.640]  I don't feel like my audience ... That's not what they're coming to me for.
[12:19.640 --> 12:24.400]  Maybe you are because you're asking for this, but these are conversations that happen more
[12:24.400 --> 12:25.620]  on the Discord channel.
[12:25.620 --> 12:29.960]  This is stuff that I do geek out late at night on Discord with people.
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.800]  I'll probably sign off of this podcast later, and I'll go to Discord, and I'll be, hey guys,
[12:33.800 --> 12:37.680]  let's talk about breeding because I've been inspired by it, and we'll just geek out there
[12:37.680 --> 12:39.320]  because then it is a two-way conversation.
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.000]  I get some feedback, and we can talk, and you can spark my brain a little bit.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.600]  For here on this podcast, I think my goal is more to get you started and give you the
[12:47.600 --> 12:48.660]  prerequisites.
[12:48.660 --> 12:52.120]  In time, in due time, I will teach you all of the breeding stuff.
[12:52.120 --> 12:54.800]  We will clear up all of those misconceptions.
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.840]  Somebody's actually asked a question about myths and misconceptions about cannabis and
[12:59.840 --> 13:07.360]  about breeding, so I will make sure to include a part about F1s, true F1s in that episode.
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.120]  Our friend Adam does include a nice example of co-dominant alleles and talking about how
[13:12.120 --> 13:14.920]  to produce the traits that we're looking for.
[13:14.920 --> 13:17.360]  I don't think it's necessary to read all of that right now.
[13:17.360 --> 13:20.080]  It's kind of a lot for somebody that doesn't understand breeding.
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.520]  It talks about finding plants, breeding a pink plant or a red plant to a white plant
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.120]  when your goal is all pink plants.
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.960]  It talks about the options and the ratios.
[13:28.960 --> 13:29.960]  This is very accurate.
[13:29.960 --> 13:34.680]  This is very intriguing, but I'm not ready to present this in the podcast yet.
[13:34.680 --> 13:37.400]  It's just not what I'm ready to teach the listeners.
[13:37.400 --> 13:39.560]  We may talk about this on the Discord.
[13:39.560 --> 13:42.440]  This may be a chat or somewhere else, but this is just not what I'm trying to do for
[13:42.440 --> 13:43.440]  this show.
[13:43.440 --> 13:44.480]  I do appreciate it.
[13:44.480 --> 13:50.360]  I will touch on the obvious fact here is that a lot of what we are calling F1s are not true
[13:50.360 --> 13:51.360]  F1s.
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.440]  They are polyhybrids.
[13:52.440 --> 13:54.820]  A lot of them have very similar parents.
[13:54.820 --> 13:59.240]  A lot of them have chem dog or cookies right in the lineage, which kind of right there
[13:59.240 --> 14:01.680]  technically makes them a polyhybrid.
[14:01.680 --> 14:06.840]  When we cross two cookie dominant or cookie parented plants together, we've made a polyhybrid.
[14:06.840 --> 14:09.440]  We haven't really done any F1 work.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.280]  That is very accurate.
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.160]  In the future, I will work out a long episode that has a lot of this included in it.
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.840]  I've got a breeding episode with a lot of myths and misconceptions that I mentioned
[14:18.840 --> 14:23.320]  that is coming up that will have F1s and other stuff included in there.
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.640]  Let me make sure I covered all of my notes on this because I do write stuff on the side
[14:26.640 --> 14:29.720]  of the paper here and sometimes I get so chattery I don't cover it.
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.000]  Yeah, it looks like I got all of that stuff for you.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.200]  Most of my listeners, honestly, I don't think, and no disrespect if you are, but I think
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.920]  the majority of my listeners are here to learn, to get a good solid foundation on growing
[14:43.920 --> 14:47.560]  and then we'll catch up to breeding once I feel like I've given all that stuff out again
[14:47.560 --> 14:48.560]  in the video format.
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.280]  A lot of it is available on the old audio format, but I want to get all that information
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.960]  out again in the video format because it's getting much more noticed on the YouTube channel
[14:56.960 --> 14:57.960]  in the video.
[14:58.200 --> 15:00.000]  All right, Adam, thank you for the great message.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.600]  I hope I give you a satisfactory answer.
[15:02.600 --> 15:03.800]  You are correct, my dude.
[15:03.800 --> 15:05.000]  Those are not true F1s.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.080]  We will talk deeper about that in the future, but right now I think we're on the right path
[15:09.080 --> 15:10.080]  for this podcast.
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.880]  All right, let's move forward to another message.
[15:13.880 --> 15:19.160]  In a previous episode, I told a story about ChemDog and the story of the 13 beans.
[15:19.160 --> 15:24.320]  I mentioned a guy named, let's see, I mentioned a guy named AJ.
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.600]  In my mind, I was confusing Joe Brand and AJ.
[15:28.600 --> 15:34.520]  AJ is known as Asshole Joe, who honestly, from what I read, is not an asshole.
[15:34.520 --> 15:35.520]  I've seen him on podcasts.
[15:35.520 --> 15:36.520]  I've seen him at events.
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.520]  He doesn't seem like an asshole, but he got the nickname Asshole Joe back in the day.
[15:40.520 --> 15:46.400]  In my mind, I was honestly mixing up, since there's Joe and Joe and I got a brain injury,
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.360]  I just Joe'd them right together and made that one person.
[15:49.360 --> 15:52.440]  Those are two different people.
[15:52.440 --> 15:55.360]  Joe Brand and Asshole Joe are two different people.
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.600]  In the story I told about ChemDog and the legend of the 13 beans, you're going to have
[15:59.600 --> 16:04.120]  to swap out the name AJ and put in Joe Brand every time.
[16:04.120 --> 16:06.800]  Then that story will be accurate to the best of my knowledge.
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.280]  I've gotten a correction and I'm acknowledging that, so let's just edit that.
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.000]  Just do that thing in the Google documents where you just replace.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.840]  Every time I said one word, just replace it with another.
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.640]  But there is a connection.
[16:21.640 --> 16:29.520]  There is a connection to why I was putting Joe Brand and Asshole Joe in the same story.
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.000]  Asshole Joe is where the sour diesel comes from.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.200]  The sour diesel is related to the ChemDog.
[16:37.200 --> 16:40.920]  I'm going to talk about that just because we happened to have pulled this story out,
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.960]  just because it happened this way.
[16:43.960 --> 16:49.480]  If you've heard of the AJ's cut of sour diesel, AJ is the one who is known for making the
[16:49.480 --> 16:51.200]  sour diesel popular.
[16:51.200 --> 16:55.440]  That sour diesel that goes around in Colorado that stinks up the car, you've got to put
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.920]  it in two baggies.
[16:56.920 --> 16:58.760]  The good sour diesel makes my eyes itch.
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.000]  It makes them feel kind of funny when I smoke it, which I enjoy.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.240]  My eyes get itchy and super bloody red, which a lot of herb doesn't make my eyes red anymore.
[17:06.240 --> 17:08.560]  But that sour D will get to it.
[17:08.560 --> 17:10.560]  It was just the diesel.
[17:10.560 --> 17:13.160]  Some other people added the word sour to it.
[17:13.160 --> 17:14.280]  We may touch on that.
[17:14.280 --> 17:16.960]  That may be a totally different podcast.
[17:16.960 --> 17:20.680]  Let's delve a little bit into this.
[17:20.680 --> 17:25.880]  There was the ChemDog story that I talked about, right?
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.320]  Legend of ChemDog and the 13 Beans.
[17:27.320 --> 17:30.600]  Two guys in Colorado, PeeBud and Joe Brand, get some herb.
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.880]  They call it the Dog Bud.
[17:32.880 --> 17:34.080]  They go to a Grateful Dead show.
[17:34.080 --> 17:37.200]  They meet a guy who wasn't called ChemDog yet.
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.320]  Later on in the future, gets the name ChemDog.
[17:40.320 --> 17:41.840]  They become friends.
[17:41.840 --> 17:49.200]  Joe Brand and PeeBud later on mail ChemDog, not ChemDog yet, but he's about to become
[17:49.200 --> 17:50.240]  ChemDog in the story.
[17:50.800 --> 17:51.800]  They mail him some herb.
[17:51.800 --> 17:53.880]  In one of the ounces, I read there were two ounces.
[17:53.880 --> 17:54.880]  One didn't have any seeds.
[17:54.880 --> 17:56.760]  The other one had 13 seeds.
[17:56.760 --> 17:59.480]  So he pulls some seeds out and he grows them.
[17:59.480 --> 18:03.280]  They were calling the weed the Dog Bud or the ChemWeed because it would make you roll
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.120]  over like a dog or lazy like a dog and it smelled like chemicals.
[18:07.120 --> 18:09.680]  So it got dubbed the ChemDog.
[18:09.680 --> 18:13.800]  The guy that grew it and found the seeds in there, he became known as ChemDog.
[18:13.800 --> 18:14.800]  He grew some seeds.
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.920]  There was ChemDog91, ChemSister, and then a couple other variations of Chem.
[18:20.600 --> 18:21.600]  There was a male that was pulled.
[18:21.600 --> 18:24.640]  There are more seeds sitting around which may get grown in the future here.
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.800]  So this guy ChemDog, he's growing weed, right?
[18:28.800 --> 18:32.520]  He's also a glass blower and he goes to Grateful Dead concerts to sell his glass and to have
[18:32.520 --> 18:36.240]  a good time because that's a great place to go sell some pipes and make some friends.
[18:36.240 --> 18:41.760]  So Chem is selling some pipes and he meets this guy named AJ who is known as AssholeJoe,
[18:41.760 --> 18:43.400]  but AssholeJoe is not an asshole.
[18:43.400 --> 18:44.400]  He's a cool guy.
[18:44.400 --> 18:47.960]  Shout out to AJ.
[18:47.960 --> 18:48.960]  They sell each other a pipe.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.080]  So Chem sells AJ a pipe and just being bros, Chem's like, well, let's smoke a bowl out
[18:53.080 --> 18:54.080]  of it.
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.080]  He made the pipe.
[18:55.080 --> 18:56.360]  He hasn't smoked out of it because you don't smoke out of it until you sell it.
[18:56.360 --> 18:58.320]  And he's like, can we smoke out of it?
[18:58.320 --> 19:01.520]  And AJ's like, sure, but let's smoke some of my weed because I got some good weed.
[19:01.520 --> 19:02.920]  And Chem's like, nah, bro, I don't know.
[19:02.920 --> 19:06.780]  I got some fire weed and they both pull out their weed and guess what they both had?
[19:06.780 --> 19:08.480]  They both had the dog bud.
[19:08.480 --> 19:10.780]  They both had the original dog bud.
[19:10.780 --> 19:12.040]  So it was kind of a bonding moment.
[19:12.040 --> 19:13.380]  They became friends at that moment.
[19:13.380 --> 19:17.800]  We got two legends in the cannabis industry becoming friends at this time.
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.400]  Dog bud and dog bud in two different bags from two legendary fucking people in the industry.
[19:22.400 --> 19:24.920]  So AJ and Chem have now met.
[19:24.920 --> 19:28.240]  And that's where I think I blended the story in my head.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.920]  So they got the same weed.
[19:29.920 --> 19:31.160]  It's the original dog bud.
[19:31.160 --> 19:34.400]  Now this is where the story gets interesting.
[19:34.400 --> 19:39.560]  They were calling, AJ was calling his dog bud diesel because anything, he's from New
[19:39.560 --> 19:44.000]  York and anything that they were smoking in New York that was good weed was called diesel.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.920]  Like now the kids call anything that is good gas, which I think is funny because gas should
[19:48.920 --> 19:53.120]  be weed that smells like gas, not weed that smells like fucking berries.
[19:53.120 --> 19:56.160]  If it smells like berries, why are you calling it gas, bro?
[19:56.160 --> 19:58.360]  Quit doing that, please culture.
[19:58.360 --> 20:00.200]  But they would just call anything that was good diesel.
[20:00.200 --> 20:01.780]  That'd be some diesel weed.
[20:01.780 --> 20:04.960]  And I think that came from Canada because I've got Canadian friends that call cool shit
[20:04.960 --> 20:05.960]  diesel.
[20:05.960 --> 20:07.080]  Like that's diesel, eh?
[20:07.080 --> 20:09.720]  So that probably came from Canadian terminology.
[20:10.680 --> 20:16.240]  The rumor has it, this is what I have pulled out from folklore, from the internet, from
[20:16.240 --> 20:18.080]  history, from people that I know.
[20:18.080 --> 20:20.200]  I know a couple of people in the weed industry.
[20:20.200 --> 20:21.680]  I know a couple of podcasters.
[20:21.680 --> 20:24.360]  I know a few of the guys that might've been involved in this.
[20:24.360 --> 20:31.320]  The story is that a mass super skunk plant accidentally pollinated AJ's chem dog plant.
[20:31.320 --> 20:34.480]  And that is where we got the diesel.
[20:34.480 --> 20:39.360]  Later on became sour diesel because there was a crew that was selling it and they were
[20:39.400 --> 20:40.400]  sour.
[20:40.400 --> 20:42.960]  They were mad about other people or other people.
[20:42.960 --> 20:46.400]  The weed was so good it would make other people mad and it was pissing people off and causing
[20:46.400 --> 20:47.400]  rivalries.
[20:47.400 --> 20:51.000]  And so the word sour got attached to it, the sour diesel.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.400]  That's the story that I've got for you.
[20:53.400 --> 20:57.400]  That's what I think happened that makes the most sense from all of the shit I have filtered
[20:57.400 --> 21:03.120]  from the internet, the interviews I've listened to on podcasts, and just things I know about
[21:03.120 --> 21:04.120]  the industry.
[21:04.120 --> 21:07.900]  So this guy, Kem, he's got the chem dog weed.
[21:07.940 --> 21:11.580]  He meets up with a guy named AJ and they both have the chem dog herb.
[21:11.580 --> 21:17.980]  It turns out that AJ had a mass super skunk plant that either hermed or was a male.
[21:17.980 --> 21:22.580]  The story is that it hermed, it accidentally pollinated the chem and made the diesel.
[21:22.580 --> 21:26.420]  So that goes back to a couple of episodes that I talked about.
[21:26.420 --> 21:27.740]  Bag seed, bro.
[21:27.740 --> 21:28.740]  Bag seed.
[21:28.740 --> 21:31.100]  Accidental seed can be the most fire shit.
[21:31.100 --> 21:36.500]  I'm talking about sour diesel, one of the most popular strains ever, ever.
[21:36.500 --> 21:38.780]  In New York, it was one of the most popular things ever.
[21:38.780 --> 21:47.020]  In Colorado, in the 2009, about 2005, 2010 era, there was a group south of me that was
[21:47.020 --> 21:51.400]  growing this sour diesel that I would line up, if I knew where to get a bunch of it,
[21:51.400 --> 21:52.980]  I would line up and buy it all.
[21:52.980 --> 21:54.460]  It was so good.
[21:54.460 --> 21:56.540]  It would make my eyes funky.
[21:56.540 --> 22:00.340]  It's hard to give me a paranoid, in my zone kind of high at this point.
[22:00.340 --> 22:04.380]  I've been smoking for so long, I had to take a few dabs to get there to get the smoke sweats
[22:04.380 --> 22:05.580]  and the paranoia.
[22:05.700 --> 22:07.420]  That sour diesel would make it feel weird.
[22:07.420 --> 22:10.460]  You'd go in the grocery store and you'd think everyone's staring at you, nobody's looking
[22:10.460 --> 22:13.660]  at you, but you just feel like everybody is staring at you.
[22:13.660 --> 22:16.820]  The ice cream aisle would pulsate when you walked down it and shit.
[22:16.820 --> 22:18.300]  That sour diesel was fire.
[22:18.300 --> 22:24.340]  So I wanted to recap because I may have said some wrong information in the last episode.
[22:24.340 --> 22:29.900]  I'm pretty sure that I was calling AJ, asshole Joe and Joe Brand was mixed up.
[22:29.900 --> 22:31.020]  I got the story wrong there.
[22:31.020 --> 22:32.820]  I wanted to make sure to correct that.
[22:32.820 --> 22:35.580]  Then I wanted to let you know how and why I made that connection.
[22:35.580 --> 22:40.620]  The guy AJ that I had in my head was the guy that gave us the sour diesel.
[22:40.620 --> 22:45.420]  So big shout out to Kim, big shout out to AJ, shout out to Joe Brand.
[22:45.420 --> 22:46.420]  Who am I missing in here?
[22:46.420 --> 22:50.180]  There's got to be somebody in this story whose name I'm fucking not giving them a shout out.
[22:50.180 --> 22:51.180]  Oh, P-Bud.
[22:51.180 --> 22:52.660]  P-Bud is the guy that I missed.
[22:52.660 --> 22:53.660]  Big shout out to all those guys.
[22:53.660 --> 22:58.060]  I got nothing but love and respect for all the people that, man, they made the legends
[22:58.060 --> 22:59.460]  that we are telling now.
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.860]  They're the forefathers of cannabis history, so that's fucking awesome.
[23:01.900 --> 23:02.900]  They were doing this.
[23:02.900 --> 23:07.860]  They were working it and hustling it before there was any thought of cannabis legalization,
[23:07.860 --> 23:09.540]  doing the all grateful dead tour hustle.
[23:09.540 --> 23:13.220]  So big up to those guys founding the culture, making some shit happen.
[23:13.220 --> 23:14.220]  All right.
[23:14.220 --> 23:16.020]  I think, I think, do I?
[23:16.020 --> 23:17.020]  Yes, I do.
[23:17.020 --> 23:20.660]  I've got one question for you and then we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[23:20.660 --> 23:24.260]  This one comes from, do they want their name said?
[23:24.260 --> 23:26.740]  I don't know if they want their name said, so I'm not going to say it.
[23:26.740 --> 23:29.340]  It says, Ross to Jeff, I was watching a video and I love it.
[23:29.340 --> 23:31.300]  I had a great laugh.
[23:31.740 --> 23:32.740]  Let's see.
[23:32.740 --> 23:33.740]  We're going to get to the question.
[23:33.740 --> 23:35.500]  It says, may I ask you a question?
[23:35.500 --> 23:39.540]  Can you have too much air movement over your girls from oscillating fans?
[23:39.540 --> 23:46.540]  Then they do explain their environment, their setup and yes, you can absolutely have too
[23:46.540 --> 23:50.900]  much airflow, too much wind on your plants.
[23:50.900 --> 23:54.300]  Sometimes the plants will start to look like they're getting leathery or papery.
[23:54.300 --> 23:57.860]  The leaves just don't look right and it doesn't look like a deficiency.
[23:57.860 --> 24:00.740]  It just doesn't look like bugs are hitting it.
[24:01.180 --> 24:02.180]  They don't even just look sad.
[24:02.180 --> 24:03.380]  They're getting wind burned.
[24:03.380 --> 24:07.940]  If the leaves right by the fan look a little bit shitty, if they're getting crispy, if
[24:07.940 --> 24:10.780]  they look dry, you are just blowing all of the water.
[24:10.780 --> 24:11.780]  They're chapped.
[24:11.780 --> 24:12.780]  They're chafed.
[24:12.780 --> 24:13.780]  They're getting wind burned.
[24:13.780 --> 24:16.460]  They've been on the boat all day and their face is all just dried out and they need some
[24:16.460 --> 24:18.980]  fucking lotion, bro.
[24:18.980 --> 24:22.700]  Yeah, you do need to minimize that amount of air on those plants.
[24:22.700 --> 24:24.260]  That wind burn will cause damage.
[24:24.260 --> 24:27.260]  It will slow down the growth.
[24:27.260 --> 24:30.420]  You're creating just a bad environment right there in that one area.
[24:31.100 --> 24:32.100]  Slow down that fan.
[24:32.100 --> 24:34.020]  Move it maybe if you have to, if you can.
[24:34.020 --> 24:37.380]  I know you're in a tent so you don't have all the options, but turn that bitch down,
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.380]  bro.
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.740]  You don't need so much fan movement in there.
[24:39.740 --> 24:42.340]  Temps and humidity are great.
[24:42.340 --> 24:43.660]  You can mess them up with that fan.
[24:43.660 --> 24:46.380]  If you're seeing problems, they're going to look leathery, papery.
[24:46.380 --> 24:47.900]  They'll start clawing.
[24:47.900 --> 24:50.580]  They may just start falling right off, turning crispy.
[24:50.580 --> 24:54.220]  It's just going to be the section right in front of the fan, so it should be fairly obvious.
[24:54.220 --> 24:59.020]  Yes, the fan can absolutely start messing up your plants.
[24:59.420 --> 25:03.900]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[25:03.900 --> 25:10.060]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, new growers, old school growers, everybody out there.
[25:10.060 --> 25:11.060]  What was I going to say?
[25:11.060 --> 25:16.020]  Pollen chuckers, greenhouse growers, inside growers, breeders, advanced breeders, everybody
[25:16.020 --> 25:18.380]  who loves the cannabis plant as much as I do.
