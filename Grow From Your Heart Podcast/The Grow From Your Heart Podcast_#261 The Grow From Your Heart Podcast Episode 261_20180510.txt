[00:00.250 --> 00:15.250]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:15.250 --> 00:35.170]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:35.170 --> 00:38.690]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the
[00:38.690 --> 00:40.850]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:40.850 --> 00:43.810]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.810 --> 00:48.250]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that
[00:48.250 --> 00:49.250]  stuff has expired.
[00:49.250 --> 00:54.810]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.810 --> 00:58.850]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado, here's a block of old
[00:58.850 --> 01:01.130]  episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:01.130 --> 01:19.930]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:19.930 --> 01:24.290]  It's time for episode number 137 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:24.290 --> 01:25.290]  news, education and conversation.
[01:25.290 --> 01:29.730]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[01:29.730 --> 01:34.010]  new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's
[01:34.010 --> 01:39.010]  just curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:39.010 --> 01:41.130]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:41.130 --> 01:43.450]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:43.450 --> 01:46.730]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:46.730 --> 01:49.650]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:49.650 --> 01:54.490]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:54.490 --> 01:57.610]  The Mystic Roots crew is on tour, ladies and gentlemen, they're passing through Colorado
[01:57.610 --> 01:58.610]  here very soon.
[01:58.610 --> 02:00.610]  June 8, they will be in Fort Collins.
[02:00.610 --> 02:05.250]  June 9, they will be at Cervantes in Denver and June 11, they will be at the Black Sheep
[02:05.250 --> 02:07.250]  in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:07.250 --> 02:09.330]  You can catch me there at the Black Sheep show.
[02:09.330 --> 02:13.370]  I am a tall white guy with dreadlocks down to my mid thigh knee region.
[02:13.370 --> 02:17.050]  I'll most likely be wearing an Irie genetics t shirt.
[02:17.050 --> 02:20.570]  Introduce yourself, say hello, give me a high five, smoke a bowl with me, smoke a dab with
[02:20.570 --> 02:22.210]  me, smoke a joint with me.
[02:22.210 --> 02:23.210]  Let's get it on.
[02:23.210 --> 02:24.690]  I would love to meet you there.
[02:24.690 --> 02:28.610]  You guys, parts of this podcast are brought to you by my good friends.
[02:28.610 --> 02:29.610]  That was hard to say.
[02:29.610 --> 02:32.490]  Parts of this podcast are brought to you by my good friends at Elevate Glass.
[02:32.490 --> 02:35.810]  That's right, Elevate Glass in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:35.810 --> 02:39.490]  If you need a new rig, if you need a new carb cap, if you need a new banger, if you need

[02:48.530 --> 02:51.650]  Tejon in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.

[02:55.650 --> 02:56.650]  Heart podcast.
[02:56.650 --> 02:59.010]  I would appreciate it and so would they.
[02:59.010 --> 03:02.290]  You guys, parts of this podcast are also brought to you by my good friends at Toke Radio.
[03:02.290 --> 03:06.250]  This podcast is available on Toke Radio every Wednesday at 1 p.m.
[03:06.250 --> 03:07.490]  Make sure you support Toke Radio.
[03:07.490 --> 03:09.170]  Tune in on Toke Radio.
[03:09.170 --> 03:10.170]  Give them a listen.
[03:10.170 --> 03:11.970]  Check out all the other wonderful podcasts on there.
[03:11.970 --> 03:16.170]  Shout out to my friend Lucy and her podcast Lucy in the Sky.
[03:16.170 --> 03:17.970]  In the future, I will be on that show.
[03:17.970 --> 03:18.970]  I have just made my commitment.
[03:18.970 --> 03:21.450]  I've just told the world that I plan on being on there.
[03:21.450 --> 03:25.410]  So Lucy, that means I've got to come on your show sometime and record with you on a Sunday.
[03:25.410 --> 03:26.410]  I look forward to it.
[03:26.410 --> 03:29.890]  So make sure you support tokeradio.com.
[03:29.890 --> 03:31.410]  Let's see, what else do I have for you?
[03:31.410 --> 03:34.450]  Portions of this podcast are brought to you by our good friends at Hemplements.
[03:34.450 --> 03:36.250]  Hemplements, you guys.
[03:36.250 --> 03:38.370]  Hemplements are bringing to you Hemp History Week.
[03:38.370 --> 03:40.810]  Hemp History Week, June 6th through June 12th.
[03:40.810 --> 03:43.690]  This is the 11th annual Hemp History Week.
[03:43.690 --> 03:48.650]  Hemp History Week began in 2009 when the Hemp Industry Association and Vote Hemp joined forces
[03:48.650 --> 03:51.650]  to raise support for industrial hemp farming in the United States.
[03:51.650 --> 03:56.130]  In 2009, the Industrial Hemp Farm Act was introduced to clarify the difference between
[03:56.130 --> 04:00.330]  cannabis and industrial hemp and to repeal federal laws outlawing the cultivation of
[04:00.330 --> 04:01.330]  industrial hemp.
[04:01.330 --> 04:07.490]  Hemp was illegal based on the ideals that it is easily confused with the cannabis plant.
[04:07.490 --> 04:12.090]  Industrial hemp does not contain THC, the main psychoactive molecule in cannabis.
[04:12.090 --> 04:15.330]  Industrial hemp is a highly sustainable crop that can be used to make products ranging
[04:15.330 --> 04:18.130]  from lip balm to hemp crete bricks.
[04:18.130 --> 04:23.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hemplements in Colorado Springs will be hosting events downtown, which
[04:23.530 --> 04:27.610]  will feature classes on how to make and use hemp fibers and discussions on the benefits
[04:27.610 --> 04:30.810]  of hemp and CBD products for health and wellness.
[04:30.810 --> 04:35.570]  There will be a variety of activities and vendors on hand for everyone.
[04:35.570 --> 04:41.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to learn more about industrial hemp, make sure you
[04:41.090 --> 04:42.690]  check out Hemplements in Colorado Springs.
[04:42.690 --> 04:45.490]  Wednesday will feature arts and crafts and story time for children.
[04:45.490 --> 04:48.090]  They will also be having a barbecue featuring hemp burgers.
[04:48.090 --> 04:49.890]  For more information, check out Hemplements.
[04:49.890 --> 04:51.290]  You can give them a call.
[04:51.290 --> 04:59.530]  It's area code 719-358-8667, or you can check them out at 22 East Bijoux in lovely downtown
[04:59.530 --> 05:00.530]  Colorado Springs.
[05:00.530 --> 05:03.490]  While you're down there, stop at Bambino's and get yourself a pizza.
[05:03.490 --> 05:04.490]  You will love it.
[05:04.490 --> 05:05.490]  All right.
[05:05.490 --> 05:07.370]  I owe a big shout out to my friends in the Colorado podcast.
[05:07.370 --> 05:12.210]  If you listened to the last episode, episode number 136, that was what I call a swap cast.
[05:12.730 --> 05:13.730]  It's also known as a crossover episode.
[05:13.730 --> 05:17.730]  I had my friends from the Colorado podcast come by and they hung out for about two hours
[05:17.730 --> 05:20.490]  and re-recorded a ridiculous podcast.
[05:20.490 --> 05:24.290]  Big shout out to Jesse Grose, shout out to Despicable D, and also a huge shout out to
[05:24.290 --> 05:25.290]  my buddy 44.
[05:25.290 --> 05:27.730]  Thank you guys for coming and recording a show.
[05:27.730 --> 05:29.810]  Make sure you guys support the Colorado podcast.
[05:29.810 --> 05:32.810]  If you haven't listened to that one yet, make sure you go back and listen to 136.
[05:32.810 --> 05:34.290]  It is a great podcast.
[05:34.290 --> 05:35.290]  All right.
[05:35.290 --> 05:39.650]  I think that's all the ads and information I have got to start the show.
[05:39.650 --> 05:44.130]  I want to talk about a message I received from a listener.
[05:44.130 --> 05:49.010]  He was talking about wondering if CBD derived from hemp is any good if it is the same as
[05:49.010 --> 05:51.330]  CBD derived from cannabis.
[05:51.330 --> 05:55.970]  He was thinking that hemp derived CBD would not have any medicinal value.
[05:55.970 --> 05:57.410]  I'm here to clear that up.
[05:57.410 --> 05:58.410]  That is inaccurate.
[05:58.410 --> 06:03.350]  CBD derived from hemp and CBD derived from cannabis is the same CBD.
[06:03.350 --> 06:05.650]  You're pulling out the same CBD.
[06:05.650 --> 06:09.530]  The main difference between hemp and cannabis is the amount of THC.
[06:10.410 --> 06:15.210]  The state of Colorado has set a threshold of how much THC is allowed to be in your plants
[06:15.210 --> 06:17.530]  before they are considered hemp or THC.
[06:17.530 --> 06:20.610]  Honestly, I do not remember the exact ratio.
[06:20.610 --> 06:22.570]  I think it's 5% THC.
[06:22.570 --> 06:24.650]  It could be 0.5% THC.
[06:24.650 --> 06:25.650]  It could be three.
[06:25.650 --> 06:27.930]  It's somewhere between three and 5% THC to the best of my knowledge.
[06:27.930 --> 06:30.490]  If it's got more than that, it is considered cannabis.
[06:30.490 --> 06:33.930]  If it's got less than that, it is considered a hemp plant.
[06:33.930 --> 06:39.130]  Our friends over at SandSol, a giant CBD farm or a giant hemp farm here in Pueblo, Colorado
[06:39.130 --> 06:43.610]  produce massive amounts of CBD product from their hemp farm.
[06:43.610 --> 06:48.030]  If you were confused, if you were thinking that CBD derived from hemp versus CBD derived
[06:48.030 --> 06:52.210]  from cannabis is a different product, ladies and gentlemen, that is the same molecule.
[06:52.210 --> 06:54.890]  It will have the same medicinal benefits.
[06:54.890 --> 06:56.850]  It will do the same thing for you.
[06:56.850 --> 07:00.690]  If you took what was considered a hemp plant that was high in CBD and a cannabis plant
[07:00.690 --> 07:04.890]  that was high in THC and you ran them both through the exact same extraction method,
[07:04.890 --> 07:11.930]  whether it be BHO or CO2, you would pull out very similar products, very similar concentrates.
[07:11.930 --> 07:18.370]  But the hemp product is going to be very high in CBD and it will not contain any THC or
[07:18.370 --> 07:21.050]  very trace amounts, if any at all.
[07:21.050 --> 07:24.090]  The only difference is the source.
[07:24.090 --> 07:27.130]  The main difference of the source is just the lack of THC.
[07:27.130 --> 07:29.130]  I pressed pause and I did a little bit of research.
[07:29.130 --> 07:34.130]  In the state of Colorado, the difference between hemp and cannabis, if a plant contains
[07:34.130 --> 07:40.290]  greater than 0.3% THC, it is considered a cannabis plant and it cannot qualify to be
[07:40.290 --> 07:42.730]  on a hemp farm.
[07:42.730 --> 07:43.730]  That is a threshold.
[07:43.730 --> 07:45.290]  There is 0.3% THC.
[07:45.290 --> 07:48.330]  If it's got more than 0.3, it cannot be grown on a hemp farm.
[07:48.330 --> 07:53.610]  It must be then grown in a medical marijuana or a recreational marijuana cultivation facility
[07:53.610 --> 07:59.050]  that is regulated by the MED, which is a totally different ballgame than growing hemp.
[07:59.470 --> 08:03.610]  We're able to produce large amounts of CBD products now because we're using hemp farms
[08:03.610 --> 08:07.770]  to do so, which is making CBD medicine available to many more people.
[08:07.770 --> 08:09.330]  I hope that clears that up for you.
[08:09.330 --> 08:11.370]  We're going to move forward.
[08:11.370 --> 08:12.370]  Thank you for the email.
[08:12.370 --> 08:13.370]  I've got another email.
[08:13.370 --> 08:14.370]  This one came from another listener.
[08:14.370 --> 08:15.930]  I'm not going to say...
[08:15.930 --> 08:19.810]  If you send me an email and you want your name said on the air, include that in your
[08:19.810 --> 08:22.690]  email because I try to be respectful and not bust out people's names.
[08:22.690 --> 08:23.770]  I don't know what state you're in.
[08:23.770 --> 08:24.770]  I don't know where you work.
[08:24.770 --> 08:25.770]  I don't know what you do.
[08:25.770 --> 08:28.530]  I don't want to get you in trouble by saying your name on the show.
[08:28.530 --> 08:31.570]  If you'd like me to say your name, just let me know.
[08:31.570 --> 08:32.570]  Here's an email.
[08:32.570 --> 08:35.930]  This one says, hey, Rasta Jeff, thanks for putting out such a quality show.
[08:35.930 --> 08:37.290]  First of all, you're very welcome.
[08:37.290 --> 08:38.290]  Thank you for the compliment.
[08:38.290 --> 08:42.210]  It's stuff like that that gives me the motivation to keep this show coming at you every week.
[08:42.210 --> 08:45.930]  It takes a lot of effort to do a weekly podcast when you work as much as I do.
[08:45.930 --> 08:51.530]  These compliments and the words of affirmation, is that what that's called?
[08:51.530 --> 08:55.890]  The compliments and words of affirmation are definitely keeping me moving strong, so I
[08:55.890 --> 08:56.890]  appreciate that.
[08:57.130 --> 09:00.130]  Then the email goes on to say, I'm looking forward to your upcoming outdoor show you
[09:00.130 --> 09:01.130]  mentioned is in the works.
[09:01.130 --> 09:06.730]  I'm wondering if you can discuss strains that do particularly well outdoors.
[09:06.730 --> 09:08.690]  I am trying to get more outdoor episodes for you.
[09:08.690 --> 09:10.090]  It's hard to get Jesse here.
[09:10.090 --> 09:14.050]  Jesse is busy with his own podcast, his own gardens, his own business, but when Jesse's
[09:14.050 --> 09:17.170]  free, I will get him here for more outdoor stuff.
[09:17.170 --> 09:20.350]  This guy says, I'm growing an organ outdoors again this year.
[09:20.350 --> 09:24.430]  When researching strains online, I couldn't find much information on which do better indoors
[09:24.430 --> 09:25.430]  and out.
[09:25.430 --> 09:29.830]  I've been up picking clones of Blue Dream, Green Crack, Sunset Sherbet, and Gorilla Glue
[09:29.830 --> 09:30.830]  4.
[09:30.830 --> 09:34.590]  I've read that Blue Dream does phenomenally outdoors, but couldn't find much on the rest.
[09:34.590 --> 09:39.870]  I looked at past Emerald Cup winners to see what has won there since those grows are outdoors,
[09:39.870 --> 09:42.550]  but I couldn't find many of those strains locally.
[09:42.550 --> 09:47.150]  I'm interested in PM resistant strains as well, since that's something we battle come
[09:47.150 --> 09:48.150]  fall.
[09:48.150 --> 09:51.310]  There's more to the email, but I took a screenshot and I didn't get the rest of it in there.
[09:51.310 --> 09:52.910]  I appreciate you sending me that email.
[09:52.910 --> 09:58.570]  Let's talk about a few strains that I think would do very well for you outdoors.
[09:58.570 --> 10:01.630]  First of all, I could recommend almost anything from DJ Short.
[10:01.630 --> 10:06.110]  DJ Short's Flow and Blueberry do wonderfully outdoors.
[10:06.110 --> 10:07.870]  Those strains are very mold resistant.
[10:07.870 --> 10:12.670]  They finish kind of early and they will give you nice heavy harvest outdoors.
[10:12.670 --> 10:16.530]  Something you want to keep in mind for an outdoor garden is you need stuff that is going
[10:16.530 --> 10:17.850]  to finish kind of early.
[10:17.850 --> 10:20.070]  You don't want it to take a super long time.
[10:20.070 --> 10:23.090]  You got to get it done before the fall or the winter comes.
[10:23.090 --> 10:26.230]  Maybe out there in Oregon, you have more time than we do here in Colorado.
[10:26.230 --> 10:28.950]  You have maybe a little longer window.
[10:28.950 --> 10:31.910]  Maybe you might be able to get something like some Sour Diesel or some Chemdog.
[10:31.910 --> 10:34.190]  Those strains do very well outdoors.
[10:34.190 --> 10:35.190]  They're very mold resistant.
[10:35.190 --> 10:39.350]  You're going to want to stick with strains that finish around 60 days.
[10:39.350 --> 10:42.950]  About eight week strains would be ideal for you.
[10:42.950 --> 10:47.230]  Something like from my lineup, I would recommend Capleton for outdoor strains.
[10:47.230 --> 10:49.110]  It finishes on time.
[10:49.110 --> 10:50.270]  It puts on nice resin.
[10:50.270 --> 10:51.270]  It loves the sunshine.
[10:51.270 --> 10:54.470]  When you grow it in soil, add plenty of kelp products.
[10:54.470 --> 10:57.990]  It'll make it taste nice and funky, nice and earthy.
[10:57.990 --> 11:00.190]  Capleton is very mold resistant.
[11:00.190 --> 11:01.850]  Also, Golden Goat.
[11:01.850 --> 11:06.890]  If you can get it finished in time, Golden Goat will take about 65 to 70 days to reach
[11:06.890 --> 11:08.670]  full maturity outdoors.
[11:08.670 --> 11:11.230]  But outdoor Golden Goat is amazing.
[11:11.230 --> 11:16.310]  Golden Goat loves that sunshine and it will harvest super heavily.
[11:16.390 --> 11:20.350]  Another strain I can recommend for great outdoor growing is Old School Hindu Kush.
[11:20.350 --> 11:25.350]  Hindu Kush finishes on time and it really loves to be grown in an outdoor environment.
[11:25.350 --> 11:29.150]  We had some wonderful Hindu Kush going through our area a few years ago.
[11:29.150 --> 11:30.150]  I knew the grower.
[11:30.150 --> 11:32.310]  He said he never had problems with mildew.
[11:32.310 --> 11:34.430]  The bugs didn't like the Hindu Kush.
[11:34.430 --> 11:36.310]  It was a wonderful plant for outdoors.
[11:36.310 --> 11:39.510]  Those are some great outdoor strains that we can recommend.
[11:39.510 --> 11:43.190]  It looks like you've already chosen your strains because you had to rely on clones that were
[11:43.190 --> 11:44.710]  available in your area.
[11:44.710 --> 11:46.430]  The Blue Dream should do alright outside.
[11:46.430 --> 11:49.670]  It should produce really heavily if it gets finished on time.
[11:49.670 --> 11:52.390]  Green Crack I don't have a lot of experience with.
[11:52.390 --> 11:54.630]  The Sunset Sherbet I don't have a lot of experience with.
[11:54.630 --> 11:57.470]  Their Gorilla Glue 4, that is a hardy plant.
[11:57.470 --> 11:59.670]  It will grow like a beast outside.
[11:59.670 --> 12:01.550]  I hope everything finishes up on time.
[12:01.550 --> 12:04.390]  I hope your outdoor harvest goes perfectly for you.
[12:04.390 --> 12:08.790]  I thank you for the email and I hope we answered your question.
[12:08.790 --> 12:11.930]  Alright, I do have another email.
[12:11.930 --> 12:14.190]  This one, if I can pull it up on the phone here.
[12:14.590 --> 12:17.150]  This one comes from one of our friends on Instagram.
[12:17.150 --> 12:21.630]  He says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I have a quick question that I feel you can easily shed some light
[12:21.630 --> 12:22.630]  upon.
[12:22.630 --> 12:24.550]  Sorry, words are hard to do you guys.
[12:24.550 --> 12:29.470]  He says, I've started my outdoor crop early indoors under a 400 watt metal halide and
[12:29.470 --> 12:34.870]  July 1st is my outside plant day and currently my plants are on a 24 hour cycle.
[12:34.870 --> 12:40.950]  I feel I should 18 six to start acclimating them to get ready for the outdoors soon.
[12:40.950 --> 12:42.390]  Any thoughts on this subject?
[12:42.390 --> 12:43.470]  I appreciate your time.
[12:43.470 --> 12:44.750]  I know you're a busy man.
[12:44.750 --> 12:48.310]  Sincerely a long time podcast listener and then he signs with his name.
[12:48.310 --> 12:54.770]  So um, dude, I don't know if you want me to say your name, but he's asking if he he's
[12:54.770 --> 12:57.870]  growing his plants indoors and he's getting them started so that he can put them outside
[12:57.870 --> 13:02.470]  July 1st and he's asking so far he's got them under a 24 hour light cycle and he's asking
[13:02.470 --> 13:07.750]  if he should adjust his light schedule to 18 six to get them ready for the outdoor sun
[13:07.750 --> 13:08.750]  schedule.
[13:08.750 --> 13:10.790]  That is a really good question.
[13:10.790 --> 13:14.070]  I feel like I'm talking really fast, so I'm going to press pause for a minute.
[13:14.070 --> 13:17.670]  I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs and a drink and I will be right back and we will
[13:17.670 --> 13:18.670]  talk about this.
[13:18.670 --> 13:21.670]  All right, I am back.
[13:21.670 --> 13:25.550]  I feel like I had enough dabs to kind of override all of the caffeine I've had today.
[13:25.550 --> 13:29.550]  I just took some fat dabs of lemon G grown by myself at the green and healthy wellness
[13:29.550 --> 13:34.510]  garden extracted by our good friends at Turpex and available on the shelves at green and
[13:34.510 --> 13:36.990]  healthy wellness in Colorado Springs.
[13:36.990 --> 13:40.470]  Since I'm talking about green and healthy wellness, I want to do two quick shout outs.
[13:41.150 --> 13:42.150]  I want to give a huge shout out to John Randalls Jr.
[13:42.150 --> 13:45.270]  That dude has been trimming his ass off.
[13:45.270 --> 13:48.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you shop at green and healthy wellness, most of the flowers
[13:48.710 --> 13:50.870]  there are trimmed by our friend Randalls.
[13:50.870 --> 13:52.710]  So make sure you follow Randalls on Instagram.
[13:52.710 --> 13:53.710]  It's at nug tendo.
[13:53.710 --> 13:55.030]  Give him a shout out.
[13:55.030 --> 13:58.430]  Let him know that you appreciate the way he is trimming the flowers.
[13:58.430 --> 14:01.190]  Also I owe a huge shout out to my new friend Zach.
[14:01.190 --> 14:02.750]  Zach is helping out in the garden.
[14:02.750 --> 14:04.670]  Zach, you were killing it my friend.
[14:04.670 --> 14:08.150]  I took a day off and I came back and all of the plants were still alive.
[14:08.150 --> 14:09.590]  So I am impressed.
[14:09.710 --> 14:10.710]  Thanks a lot, brother.
[14:10.710 --> 14:15.030]  I should mention that green and healthy wellness is a medical cannabis only facility.
[14:15.030 --> 14:16.190]  We're in Colorado Springs.
[14:16.190 --> 14:19.710]  Colorado Springs does not allow any recreational cannabis sales.
[14:19.710 --> 14:24.790]  So if you'd like to shop with us, you do need your purple medical marijuana card.
[14:24.790 --> 14:25.790]  Drop in and see us.
[14:25.790 --> 14:27.830]  Green and healthy wellness, 430 West Colorado Avenue.
[14:27.830 --> 14:30.870]  We'd love to help you out with all of your medical cannabis needs.
[14:30.870 --> 14:32.070]  Also check us out in Denver.
[14:32.070 --> 14:34.750]  We're called nugs 303.
[14:34.750 --> 14:37.110]  Once again, a medical only facility.
[14:37.110 --> 14:38.110]  We'd love to help you out.
[14:38.230 --> 14:40.590]  Hey guys, let's get back to this listener email.
[14:40.590 --> 14:43.950]  Our listener was asking about putting his plants outdoors.
[14:43.950 --> 14:45.830]  He's had them on a 24 hour light cycle.
[14:45.830 --> 14:51.230]  He wants to know if he should adjust his lights to an 18, 6 photo period before taking them
[14:51.230 --> 14:52.230]  outside.
[14:52.230 --> 14:56.750]  You know, I sent Jesse a message and I asked him what he thought about this because I had
[14:56.750 --> 14:58.190]  my own idea.
[14:58.190 --> 15:00.190]  Jesse and I have two different ideas on this.
[15:00.190 --> 15:03.590]  I think both of these ideas are going to work.
[15:03.590 --> 15:05.510]  Let me say this before I get too far into this.
[15:05.630 --> 15:10.310]  No matter what you do, I recommend that you take these plants outside and put them in
[15:10.310 --> 15:15.310]  the sun for maybe two hours on the first day and then bring them back inside and then take
[15:15.310 --> 15:19.150]  them outside and put them in the sun for maybe two and a half to three hours the next day
[15:19.150 --> 15:23.270]  and then bring them back inside and then take them back outside and just give them like,
[15:23.270 --> 15:28.030]  you know, maybe 30 to another hour every day of sunlight so they can get used to that sun.
[15:28.030 --> 15:31.270]  Maybe by about the seventh to 10th day, you can just leave them out there and they'll
[15:31.270 --> 15:32.270]  be cool.
[15:32.270 --> 15:35.390]  You should slowly adjust them to the sun or they're good.
[15:35.390 --> 15:39.030]  They might get fried if they're if they're not super hardy plants, that sun might kick
[15:39.030 --> 15:40.030]  their ass.
[15:40.030 --> 15:41.030]  So keep that in mind.
[15:41.030 --> 15:43.750]  Slowly introduce them to the sun because if you just put them out there, they're going
[15:43.750 --> 15:45.670]  to get a sunburn and kind of freak out.
[15:45.670 --> 15:47.310]  So think about that.
[15:47.310 --> 15:51.830]  My opinion about your light cycle was that you should just leave your lights on 24 hours
[15:51.830 --> 15:55.110]  and then start taking the plants out and get them adjusted.
[15:55.110 --> 15:58.430]  And then once you take them outside, once you're permanently out there, if you have
[15:58.430 --> 16:01.390]  them in pots and you're going to leave them out there or if you put them in the ground,
[16:01.510 --> 16:06.590]  once they're out there forever, it will only take a few days for them to adjust to the
[16:06.590 --> 16:07.910]  sun's natural photo period.
[16:07.910 --> 16:12.470]  The sun is much more intense than the light that you have in your grow room.
[16:12.470 --> 16:15.670]  It will train those plants what to do.
[16:15.670 --> 16:20.950]  There are specific spectrums that the sun puts off at sunrise and sunset that trigger
[16:20.950 --> 16:25.310]  hormones inside your plant that tell it when to go to sleep and when to wake up.
[16:25.310 --> 16:30.670]  So the sun will start programming your plant when to wake up and when to sleep very quickly.
[16:30.670 --> 16:33.870]  It won't take very long for your plant to adjust to that.
[16:33.870 --> 16:39.470]  If you leave your grow lights on 24-7, then you take it outside and you throw it in that
[16:39.470 --> 16:43.230]  sun on that normal cycle, it may start to flower.
[16:43.230 --> 16:45.210]  That's the only downfall to that.
[16:45.210 --> 16:49.550]  It may start to auto flower a little bit early and then it'll go back into veg and then it
[16:49.550 --> 16:51.910]  will flower at the appropriate time.
[16:51.910 --> 16:56.910]  So that may be an issue if you have a plant that has a very, very sensitive photo period.
[16:56.910 --> 16:59.630]  That would be the only downfall to that.
[16:59.630 --> 17:05.830]  So what Jesse said to do was to try to match the schedule of the sun with the schedule
[17:05.830 --> 17:07.490]  of your grow lights.
[17:07.490 --> 17:12.470]  That's going to be a little bit challenging because like I said, the time that the news
[17:12.470 --> 17:17.070]  or your farmer's almanac are going to say that the sun is going to rise and set, that
[17:17.070 --> 17:21.310]  is those times in those books and on the news are accurate.
[17:21.310 --> 17:27.710]  But when do the far red and near red spectrums of the sun start shining onto your plants
[17:27.710 --> 17:28.710]  outside?
[17:28.790 --> 17:30.790]  How do you figure that out exactly?
[17:30.790 --> 17:36.470]  So you're going to want to try to match the sun rise and sunset as best you can to get
[17:36.470 --> 17:38.150]  those plants on sort of a schedule.
[17:38.150 --> 17:43.530]  But I think that you'd be just fine if you ran that 24-hour light cycle and slowly introduce
[17:43.530 --> 17:45.030]  your plants to the sun.
[17:45.030 --> 17:47.470]  It's called hardening them off.
[17:47.470 --> 17:50.950]  Get them nice and stable, put them in their forever homes and then just let the sun work
[17:50.950 --> 17:55.270]  its magic and put those plants into its schedule.
[17:55.270 --> 17:56.910]  That would be my guidance.
[17:56.910 --> 18:01.590]  If you have the time and the energy, do some research, find out what time the sun will
[18:01.590 --> 18:06.710]  be setting and rising for about a week and then start adjusting your timers every day
[18:06.710 --> 18:12.590]  to that schedule and get your sun rise and sunset times matched up exactly to the outside
[18:12.590 --> 18:17.030]  time with the sun and then start putting your plants outside, harden them off and get them
[18:17.030 --> 18:18.030]  on that schedule.
[18:18.030 --> 18:22.270]  And by the time they're outside permanently, have them adjusted to that schedule.
[18:22.270 --> 18:26.790]  If you have the time and the energy to research it and make that happen, do it.
[18:26.790 --> 18:30.870]  If you don't have the energy and the time for that, run it 24-7 and throw them out there.
[18:30.870 --> 18:34.970]  If you're running some Indicas, you'll be just fine.
[18:34.970 --> 18:40.910]  If you're running some Sativas, they may start to flower on you a little bit early.
[18:40.910 --> 18:44.370]  Some of those Sativas will flower a little bit sooner because just a slight change in
[18:44.370 --> 18:47.910]  photo period is all they get in their natural habitat.
[18:47.910 --> 18:52.030]  So they're going to trigger flowering with just a little bit of a variation in photo
[18:52.030 --> 18:53.030]  period.
[18:53.030 --> 18:54.950]  So pay attention to your plants.
[18:54.950 --> 18:59.350]  If you do notice that your plants are starting to flower a little bit too early in the season,
[18:59.350 --> 19:03.230]  one good way to stop that from happening or to make sure that it doesn't happen is to
[19:03.230 --> 19:07.950]  get a light and get a long extension cord and just carry a light outside and shine it
[19:07.950 --> 19:12.070]  over all of those plants about three hours after the sun goes down.
[19:12.070 --> 19:16.150]  And that will keep those plants awake and it won't let them turn into their flowering
[19:16.150 --> 19:17.430]  cycle.
[19:17.430 --> 19:20.330]  So that's one way you can make sure that they don't flower too early.
[19:20.330 --> 19:23.650]  And if you do see them starting to flower a little bit early, that's one way to kind
[19:23.650 --> 19:26.330]  of revert and prevent this from happening.
[19:26.330 --> 19:30.210]  It doesn't matter what kind of light you use and it doesn't have to be really super intense.
[19:30.210 --> 19:33.890]  As long as you just get out there for a few minutes and shine it over each plant, you'll
[19:33.890 --> 19:34.930]  wake them up.
[19:34.930 --> 19:35.930]  They won't start sleeping.
[19:35.930 --> 19:39.650]  They won't get enough sleep to go into their flowering period and you can kind of extend
[19:39.650 --> 19:41.850]  your veg phase.
[19:41.850 --> 19:45.690]  So I hope that helped you make a decision on how you're going to handle your adjustment.
[19:45.690 --> 19:48.850]  Just make sure you introduce the plants to the sunshine kind of slowly because if they're
[19:48.850 --> 19:53.170]  small plants, if they're not really healthy, that sun will kick their ass.
[19:53.690 --> 19:57.730]  Also, if you've got more plants inside, if you're taking some plants outside and then
[19:57.730 --> 20:02.370]  bringing them back, if you do leave plants inside for an indoor grow, make sure you treat
[20:02.370 --> 20:07.450]  those because there's a good likelihood that you will bring outdoor pests into your indoor
[20:07.450 --> 20:09.290]  garden and cause a problem there.
[20:09.290 --> 20:10.450]  So be careful with that.
[20:10.450 --> 20:12.850]  And also here's guidance for anybody with two gardens.
[20:12.850 --> 20:16.210]  If you've got an indoor and an outdoor garden, if you're growing cannabis in more than one
[20:16.210 --> 20:21.450]  location, should, if you've got two indoor gardens, try to change clothes and shoes before
[20:21.450 --> 20:25.010]  you go from one garden to the other, especially your outdoor and indoor garden.
[20:25.010 --> 20:29.450]  You don't want to run from the outdoor garden to your indoor garden in the same shoes and
[20:29.450 --> 20:32.570]  the same pants and the same shirt and the same hat.
[20:32.570 --> 20:34.730]  It's a good idea to change clothes if you can.
[20:34.730 --> 20:38.930]  I know it's not always possible, but try to kick off your shoes, change your pants, change
[20:38.930 --> 20:40.730]  your t-shirt, put on a different hat.
[20:40.730 --> 20:44.090]  If you've got dreadlocks like me, put up your dreads in a different hat.
[20:44.090 --> 20:47.090]  You just don't want to drag problems from one garden to the other.
[20:47.090 --> 20:51.410]  If you've got powdery mildew, if you've got spider mites, your shoes, your hat, your clothes,
[20:51.410 --> 20:53.370]  what's the greatest way to move those bugs around?
[20:53.370 --> 20:57.370]  It'll just introduce problems to every garden you go to.
[20:57.370 --> 21:00.650]  Try to keep in mind when you're moving from one place to another, if you're going from
[21:00.650 --> 21:04.330]  your garden to your friend's garden to another person's garden, just keep in mind you're
[21:04.330 --> 21:07.330]  just spreading garden STDs everywhere you go.
[21:07.330 --> 21:10.170]  Keep a change of clothes in your car if you're that kind of person.
[21:10.170 --> 21:14.570]  Do what you can to stop spreading spider mites and fucking powdery mildew through the cannabis
[21:14.570 --> 21:15.850]  industry.
[21:15.850 --> 21:16.850]  That's my guidance.
[21:16.850 --> 21:19.090]  All right, that's enough listener emails for today.
[21:19.090 --> 21:21.170]  I appreciate everybody that sends me messages.
[21:21.930 --> 21:24.530]  Please send me messages at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[21:24.530 --> 21:26.170]  I would love to get messages from you.
[21:26.170 --> 21:28.090]  I would love to hear your questions.
[21:28.090 --> 21:31.230]  I like making content that is aimed at listeners.
[21:31.230 --> 21:34.770]  That way I know that I'm giving you what you want and what you need.
[21:34.770 --> 21:36.290]  Makes it easy for both of us.
[21:36.290 --> 21:38.850]  I want to give a huge shout out to a product.
[21:38.850 --> 21:40.970]  This company does not pay me, or at least not yet.
[21:40.970 --> 21:44.690]  Maybe they will after they hear this, but this is just a genuine product endorsement.
[21:44.690 --> 21:49.090]  You guys, I can highly recommend a product called Big Time Exterminator.
[21:49.090 --> 21:51.370]  Big Time Exterminator will get rid of your powdery mildew.
[21:51.370 --> 21:55.530]  I used it for a patient of mine who's got a small garden.
[21:55.530 --> 21:57.330]  An elderly gentleman who needs a lot of help.
[21:57.330 --> 21:59.610]  He had a powdery mildew issue.
[21:59.610 --> 22:03.770]  Big Time Exterminator seems to have gotten rid of his powdery mildew issue.
[22:03.770 --> 22:06.250]  Also, it got rid of white flies in another garden.
[22:06.250 --> 22:07.770]  I have not seen a white fly.
[22:07.770 --> 22:08.930]  I have not seen a spider mite.
[22:08.930 --> 22:10.330]  I haven't seen a fungus gnat.
[22:10.330 --> 22:15.170]  It seems like Big Time Exterminator is doing a very good job at getting rid of a lot of
[22:15.170 --> 22:16.170]  problems.
[22:16.170 --> 22:20.170]  It is also approved by the Colorado MED, so it is allowed to be used in commercial
[22:20.170 --> 22:21.170]  applications.
[22:21.170 --> 22:23.930]  Shout out to Big Time Exterminator.
[22:23.930 --> 22:28.330]  Somehow let those guys know that I am endorsing their product for free just because it works.
[22:28.330 --> 22:30.570]  I've seen it work, and I approve of it.
[22:30.570 --> 22:31.570]  Great product, you guys.
[22:31.570 --> 22:32.570]  Go find yourself some of that.
[22:32.570 --> 22:37.010]  If you've got some powdery mildew or spider mites, or just use it as a preventative, it
[22:37.010 --> 22:38.770]  will definitely work for you.
[22:38.770 --> 22:39.770]  All right, guys.
[22:39.770 --> 22:40.770]  That's enough product endorsements.
[22:40.770 --> 22:44.370]  I've got another episode coming up pretty soon for my friend, Fred.
[22:44.570 --> 22:47.370]  Fred asked about harvesting a seed crop.
[22:47.370 --> 22:49.330]  He has done his first breeding project.
[22:49.330 --> 22:50.370]  His seeds are almost ready.
[22:50.370 --> 22:51.570]  He needs a little help with that.
[22:51.570 --> 22:55.770]  Fred, I do plan on putting together an episode for you all about how to take care of your
[22:55.770 --> 22:56.770]  seed harvest.
[22:56.770 --> 22:59.690]  I've got a bunch of great stuff written down, a bunch of content coming for you.
[22:59.690 --> 23:00.690]  Let's see.
[23:00.690 --> 23:01.730]  Let's do a few shout outs right here.
[23:01.730 --> 23:05.890]  I want to do a huge shout out to my friends in the Closet Blue Dream Lovers group.
[23:05.890 --> 23:06.890]  What up, what up?
[23:06.890 --> 23:07.890]  Hashtag fuck blue dream.
[23:07.890 --> 23:11.770]  Also, I want to give a huge shout out to my friends, Molly and Lindsey.
[23:11.770 --> 23:12.770]  They brought me some pizza.
[23:12.770 --> 23:14.170]  That was fucking rad.
[23:14.170 --> 23:15.170]  They deserve a shout out.
[23:15.170 --> 23:16.170]  Hashtag stop dropping glob.
[23:16.170 --> 23:23.010]  Also, a big shout out to my friend, Jenny Beth and Hemplements for supporting the podcast.
[23:23.010 --> 23:25.090]  Also a huge shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass Galleries.
[23:25.090 --> 23:28.730]  You guys, make sure you go down to Elevate Glass Galleries in Colorado Springs.
[23:28.730 --> 23:30.010]  Support local glass artists.
[23:30.010 --> 23:33.010]  Support a local glass shop and go grab a new rig from Elevate.
[23:33.010 --> 23:36.250]  It's 517 South Tejon in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[23:36.250 --> 23:37.730]  There's a tattoo shop right next door.
[23:37.730 --> 23:40.450]  So if you want to get poked, go get yourself a new tattoo.
[23:40.450 --> 23:43.490]  There's a dispensary right next door to the tattoo shop.
[23:43.490 --> 23:44.890]  Everything you need right there in one block.
[23:44.890 --> 23:47.030]  Make sure you tell them that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[23:47.030 --> 23:49.050]  Make sure you let them know you're listening to the Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[23:49.050 --> 23:50.850]  We would all appreciate that.
[23:50.850 --> 23:52.890]  Big huge shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band.
[23:52.890 --> 23:56.690]  If you were at the show June 11th at the Black Sheep in Colorado Springs, make sure you come
[23:56.690 --> 23:57.690]  say hello.
[23:57.690 --> 23:58.690]  Shake my hand.
[23:58.690 --> 23:59.690]  We may take some dabs.
[23:59.690 --> 24:00.690]  You never know what could happen.
[24:00.690 --> 24:04.130]  Dude, have you guys been checking out Prophets of Rage?
[24:04.130 --> 24:05.130]  Holy shit.
[24:05.130 --> 24:06.130]  That is rad.
[24:06.130 --> 24:07.130]  I like it.
[24:07.130 --> 24:08.410]  If you haven't checked that out, make sure you check that out.
[24:08.410 --> 24:09.410]  That is some good shit.
[24:09.410 --> 24:12.010]  All right, you guys, this show is officially over.
[24:12.010 --> 24:13.390]  It would be cool if you go to iTunes.
[24:13.390 --> 24:17.030]  If you go to the iTunes store, if you search for the Girl From Your Heart podcast, find
[24:17.030 --> 24:19.790]  the review section, type in a comment, let me know what you think about the podcast,
[24:19.790 --> 24:23.270]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[24:23.270 --> 24:26.750]  It would also be really cool if you went and told a few of your friends about the podcast.
[24:26.750 --> 24:29.710]  You guys, if you have friends that grow cannabis, if you have friends that smoke cannabis, just
[24:29.710 --> 24:33.230]  let them know that there's a podcast called the Girl From Your Heart podcast, and they
[24:33.230 --> 24:34.550]  would love to hear about it.
[24:34.550 --> 24:37.430]  The more people that know about the show, the more people that can grow better cannabis,
[24:37.430 --> 24:40.950]  the more people that will support legalization of cannabis, the more people that will join
[24:40.950 --> 24:43.230]  our team, the more people will know the truth.
[24:43.230 --> 24:44.510]  That's what we really need to do here.
[24:44.510 --> 24:47.750]  All right, you guys, I think that's all I've got for you.
[24:47.750 --> 24:49.390]  If you want to sponsor the show, send me an email.
[24:49.390 --> 24:50.390]  It's girlfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[24:50.390 --> 24:53.430]  I'd love to get you all the information that you need.
[24:53.430 --> 27:35.180]  Until next time, you guys, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:17.100 --> 31:19.100]  ... pointing toes on to Zion.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.100]  Give your heart for your kingdom, yeah.
[31:20.100 --> 31:21.100]  Just once, oh come, oh come now.
[31:21.100 --> 31:22.100]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[31:22.100 --> 31:23.100]  It's time for episode number 138 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[31:23.100 --> 31:24.100]  news, education, and conversation.
[31:24.100 --> 31:25.100]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[31:25.100 --> 31:26.100]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[31:26.100 --> 31:27.100]  about the current issues in cannabis, we've got a lot of great stuff for you to learn.
[31:27.100 --> 31:28.100]  We've got a lot of great stuff for you to learn.
[31:28.100 --> 31:29.100]  And we've got a whole lot of great stuff for you to learn.
[31:29.100 --> 31:30.100]  And if you're a new grower or a dedicated dabber, we've got a whole lot of great stuff
[31:30.100 --> 31:31.100]  for you to learn.
[31:31.100 --> 31:34.500]  Shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[31:36.380 --> 31:37.940]  Last night, the Mystic Roots band played
[31:37.940 --> 31:39.420]  at the Black Sheep in Colorado Springs,
[31:39.420 --> 31:40.900]  and it was a great show.
[31:40.900 --> 31:41.740]  I had a great time.
[31:41.740 --> 31:44.240]  I danced my ass off, I sang my ass off.
[31:44.240 --> 31:45.420]  The Mystic Roots band came out,
[31:45.420 --> 31:47.180]  and they played their first song,
[31:47.180 --> 31:49.100]  and then they dedicated their second song
[31:49.100 --> 31:50.660]  to Irie Genetics and myself,
[31:50.660 --> 31:52.660]  and that song was Pass the Marijuana.
[31:52.660 --> 31:54.700]  So big shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots.
[31:54.700 --> 31:55.900]  Thanks for putting on a great show.
[31:55.900 --> 31:57.940]  Thanks for making me feel like a VIP.
[31:57.940 --> 31:58.820]  I had a great ass time.
[31:58.820 --> 32:00.880]  Also, big shout out to Catchafaya,
[32:00.880 --> 32:02.960]  and also a big thanks to everyone at the Black Sheep
[32:02.960 --> 32:04.400]  for letting us get down in there.
[32:04.400 --> 32:06.000]  There may have been some ganja smoking,
[32:06.000 --> 32:07.500]  and nobody tried to stop us,
[32:07.500 --> 32:09.440]  so much love and respect to the Black Sheep
[32:09.440 --> 32:10.760]  in Colorado Springs.
[32:10.760 --> 32:11.680]  Big shout out to the bands.
[32:11.680 --> 32:12.800]  Big shout out to Catchafaya.
[32:12.800 --> 32:14.080]  They came all the way from New Zealand
[32:14.080 --> 32:15.560]  to play in the States.
[32:15.560 --> 32:16.400]  That band is pretty cool.
[32:16.400 --> 32:18.320]  I had a good time checking those guys out,
[32:18.320 --> 32:19.240]  but I really had a good time
[32:19.240 --> 32:21.000]  getting down to the Mystic Roots.
[32:21.000 --> 32:21.840]  I hope I saw you there.
[32:21.840 --> 32:23.200]  I hope we got a high five together.
[32:23.200 --> 32:24.040]  I hope we got a dab.
[32:24.040 --> 32:25.320]  I hope I got to shake your hand.
[32:25.320 --> 32:26.720]  I hope we saw each other and had a great time.
[32:26.720 --> 32:28.600]  Big shout out to Smiles and the crew.
[32:28.600 --> 32:29.940]  Big shout out to Jessica.
[32:29.940 --> 32:31.140]  All the wooks that I hung out with.
[32:31.140 --> 32:33.340]  I had a great time with you guys.
[32:33.340 --> 32:34.640]  All right, you guys, in this podcast,
[32:34.640 --> 32:37.180]  I have my friend Will, the Barefoot Grower, over,
[32:37.180 --> 32:39.140]  and we also had Rob from Sour Seeds over,
[32:39.140 --> 32:41.960]  and we talked a whole bunch about breeding.
[32:41.960 --> 32:44.100]  My friend Fred Garvin sent me an email,
[32:44.100 --> 32:46.960]  and he asked about harvesting his first seed crop.
[32:46.960 --> 32:49.520]  Fred is halfway through his first breeding project,
[32:49.520 --> 32:50.900]  and he wanted a little bit of guidance
[32:50.900 --> 32:53.540]  on how to properly take down his seeded plants,
[32:53.540 --> 32:54.740]  how to get the seeds out of there,
[32:54.740 --> 32:56.700]  how to store them, and how to care for them.
[32:56.700 --> 32:59.380]  So we're gonna give a long discussion
[32:59.820 --> 33:02.220]  on pulling the seeds out of your seeded plants.
[33:02.220 --> 33:03.260]  Before we get that far, you guys,
[33:03.260 --> 33:04.540]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friends
[33:04.540 --> 33:06.300]  at Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[33:06.300 --> 33:09.160]  If you need a new rig, if you need a new nail,
[33:09.160 --> 33:10.180]  if you need a new dabber,
[33:10.180 --> 33:11.820]  if you're trying to buy a brand new e-nail,
[33:11.820 --> 33:13.580]  you can check out my friends at Elevate Glass.
[33:13.580 --> 33:15.820]  They're located at 517 South Tejon
[33:15.820 --> 33:18.100]  in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[33:18.100 --> 33:19.900]  Make sure you let them know Ross and Jeff sent you,
[33:19.900 --> 33:21.060]  and let them know that you're listening
[33:21.060 --> 33:22.460]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[33:22.460 --> 33:24.060]  We would both appreciate it.
[33:24.060 --> 33:25.500]  So make sure you check out Elevate Glass,
[33:25.500 --> 33:28.660]  517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[33:28.660 --> 33:29.860]  You guys, I'm gonna let this music play
[33:29.860 --> 33:31.620]  for a couple of seconds, and when we get back,
[33:31.620 --> 33:33.780]  we will be joined by the Barefoot Grower
[33:33.780 --> 33:35.760]  and Rob from Sour Seeds.
[33:41.060 --> 33:43.020]  All right, podcast world, we are back.
[33:43.020 --> 33:45.020]  Joining me at the table is my good buddy, Will,
[33:45.020 --> 33:46.500]  also known as the Barefoot Grower.
[33:46.500 --> 33:47.620]  Welcome to the table, bro.
[33:47.620 --> 33:48.460]  What's going on, man?
[33:48.460 --> 33:50.100]  Hey, are you still blowing glass?
[33:50.100 --> 33:52.100]  Unfortunately, I kinda had to put that on hiatus for a while.
[33:52.100 --> 33:52.940]  Okay, I was just curious.
[33:52.940 --> 33:55.740]  I saw you change from Barefoot Blower or Glass,
[33:55.740 --> 33:56.580]  Barefoot Glass to Barefoot Grower.
[33:56.580 --> 33:57.660]  Not the Barefoot Blower.
[33:57.660 --> 33:58.980]  No, no, no, no.
[33:58.980 --> 34:00.300]  No, no, no, no.
[34:00.300 --> 34:01.300]  That's another podcast.
[34:01.740 --> 34:03.340]  That's a whole different type of podcast.
[34:03.340 --> 34:04.180]  Welcome to the show, man.
[34:04.180 --> 34:05.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[34:05.000 --> 34:05.840]  Thanks for having me, man.
[34:05.840 --> 34:07.380]  Also across the table from me is my good buddy,
[34:07.380 --> 34:08.460]  Rob from Sour Seeds.
[34:08.460 --> 34:09.300]  How you doing today, bro?
[34:09.300 --> 34:10.140]  What's going on?
[34:10.140 --> 34:10.960]  Good to be back.
[34:10.960 --> 34:11.800]  Man, we got Rob a little bit too high.
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.940]  He's got a funny look on his face,
[34:12.940 --> 34:14.300]  but I think he's gonna be all right in a minute.
[34:14.300 --> 34:16.300]  I got that Bill Cosby grin.
[34:16.300 --> 34:17.460]  Oh, shit.
[34:17.460 --> 34:19.700]  Oh, man, so you might be the Barefoot Blower.
[34:23.420 --> 34:24.700]  We're off to a good start.
[34:24.700 --> 34:25.780]  What do you say to that?
[34:25.780 --> 34:28.540]  This is not gonna turn into the Colorado podcast.
[34:29.540 --> 34:32.540]  I will get this back on the rails very quickly.
[34:32.540 --> 34:33.900]  So thanks for coming to the table, guys.
[34:33.900 --> 34:35.940]  Both these guys, we've been talking about how busy we are.
[34:35.940 --> 34:37.620]  We sat here for an hour and talked about
[34:37.620 --> 34:39.220]  how we don't have time for shit.
[34:41.500 --> 34:42.840]  Which is kind of funny if you ask me.
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.380]  So we're gonna talk about,
[34:44.380 --> 34:46.260]  our friend Fred Garvin sent me an email,
[34:46.260 --> 34:49.320]  and he is halfway through a seed breeding project.
[34:49.320 --> 34:51.980]  This is his first run trying to make seeds.
[34:51.980 --> 34:55.280]  He wants some guidance on how to harvest the seeds,
[34:55.280 --> 34:58.140]  maybe when to pull the seeds and things to look for.
[34:58.780 --> 35:01.360]  I thought, shit, my buddy Rob breeds a lot of seeds.
[35:01.360 --> 35:02.220]  I breed a lot of seeds.
[35:02.220 --> 35:04.020]  We'll get Rob over to talk about it.
[35:04.020 --> 35:05.740]  Will was coming over to hang out and take some dabs.
[35:05.740 --> 35:06.940]  He brought a dope ass mothership.
[35:06.940 --> 35:09.340]  So I was like, hang out, we'll put you on a podcast.
[35:09.340 --> 35:12.700]  So we're gonna talk a little bit about seed breeding.
[35:12.700 --> 35:14.620]  Rob's got a bunch of notes.
[35:14.620 --> 35:16.100]  Is there anywhere you'd like to start with, bro?
[35:16.100 --> 35:18.540]  Because you were looking at that thing pretty intently.
[35:20.060 --> 35:21.500]  I think we should start from the beginning.
[35:21.500 --> 35:22.340]  Okay.
[35:23.500 --> 35:26.060]  The moment, the conception, basically.
[35:26.260 --> 35:28.100]  When the seed starts, when to pollinate,
[35:28.100 --> 35:31.580]  and how to pollinate, timing-wise,
[35:31.580 --> 35:33.180]  Indica's versus Sativa's versus hybrid.
[35:33.180 --> 35:34.980]  So hopefully you've got yourself a solid male
[35:34.980 --> 35:36.100]  that we've talked about before.
[35:36.100 --> 35:38.180]  Actually, you came and talked about that with me.
[35:38.180 --> 35:39.420]  So hopefully you've got a solid male.
[35:39.420 --> 35:41.580]  You've got your females chosen.
[35:41.580 --> 35:44.860]  Now it is time to actually breed some plants.
[35:44.860 --> 35:48.860]  So if you're gonna pick some Indica plants,
[35:48.860 --> 35:51.900]  when should we start to pollinate our Indica plants?
[35:51.900 --> 35:53.500]  I would say between week three and four,
[35:53.500 --> 35:55.420]  when your bud sets really start to form up
[35:55.420 --> 35:56.380]  for the first time.
[35:57.380 --> 36:01.700]  I would say when they get about good nickel to quarter size.
[36:01.700 --> 36:02.540]  Okay.
[36:02.540 --> 36:04.260]  That way you got plenty of,
[36:04.260 --> 36:06.140]  because what it's really gonna determine down on
[36:06.140 --> 36:07.140]  is how many hairs you have,
[36:07.140 --> 36:08.860]  basically how many pistils you have.
[36:08.860 --> 36:11.700]  And they're what carry the pollen down
[36:11.700 --> 36:13.300]  to actually make the progress happen.
[36:13.300 --> 36:15.620]  So when you see the pistils nice and thick,
[36:15.620 --> 36:17.700]  it kind of looks like you got some little spiders going on.
[36:17.700 --> 36:20.300]  When those dandelions, when the hairs in the dandelions,
[36:20.300 --> 36:22.340]  I know that's such obvious terms,
[36:22.340 --> 36:24.340]  but when those pistils get thick and ready,
[36:24.340 --> 36:25.860]  that's when that plant is ovulating
[36:25.860 --> 36:27.780]  and it wants to receive that male pollen.
[36:27.780 --> 36:30.260]  So in your Indica plants, you're absolutely right.
[36:30.260 --> 36:33.380]  About three weeks ish, about day 21 to about day 28 ish
[36:33.380 --> 36:35.140]  is usually when I try to hit an Indica plant.
[36:35.140 --> 36:36.220]  Indica domino hybrid,
[36:36.220 --> 36:37.940]  you can get away with maybe sometime week four,
[36:37.940 --> 36:40.340]  if it's bred out with a sativa or something like that,
[36:40.340 --> 36:42.180]  has slightly longer flowering time.
[36:42.180 --> 36:44.740]  You just really have to use your best judgment,
[36:44.740 --> 36:47.260]  but typically week three is about the money for it,
[36:47.260 --> 36:48.660]  in my opinion.
[36:48.660 --> 36:51.380]  How about if we're working with a more sativa dominant plant?
[36:51.380 --> 36:52.700]  Do you wanna go a little bit later, you think?
[36:52.700 --> 36:53.540]  You do.
[36:53.540 --> 36:55.340]  I think you wanna get a little bit later.
[36:55.340 --> 36:56.220]  And the reason being,
[36:56.220 --> 36:58.820]  because if you do a pollination too early,
[36:58.820 --> 37:01.100]  you're not gonna get the seed stock you want.
[37:01.100 --> 37:02.780]  And then they also might be sitting in the plant
[37:02.780 --> 37:04.500]  for too long and the plant might not be ripe,
[37:04.500 --> 37:06.020]  but the seeds will be.
[37:06.020 --> 37:08.300]  So the seeds will overripen,
[37:08.300 --> 37:10.740]  just like any fruit or anything else out there,
[37:10.740 --> 37:12.060]  it can overripen.
[37:12.060 --> 37:14.580]  I've seen them pop inside the bud before.
[37:14.580 --> 37:15.700]  I've seen all kinds of things.
[37:15.700 --> 37:17.340]  I've actually seen a seed germinate itself
[37:17.340 --> 37:18.180]  inside of a bud.
[37:18.180 --> 37:19.740]  That's fucking amazing.
[37:19.740 --> 37:20.580]  That's cool.
[37:20.580 --> 37:22.620]  When you guys say Indica and sativa,
[37:22.660 --> 37:24.140]  are you talking about the female you're using
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.140]  or the cross that you're trying to get?
[37:26.140 --> 37:27.660]  The female that we're starting with.
[37:27.660 --> 37:29.460]  Yeah, the girl that's going to receive the pollen.
[37:29.460 --> 37:30.300]  Yeah, the girl.
[37:30.300 --> 37:31.140]  That's why Will's here,
[37:31.140 --> 37:31.980]  to keep us on track.
[37:31.980 --> 37:32.820]  That's exactly it.
[37:32.820 --> 37:33.660]  That's a great question.
[37:33.660 --> 37:34.500]  That's a great question.
[37:34.500 --> 37:36.260]  And yeah, we're always,
[37:36.260 --> 37:37.100]  with that word,
[37:37.100 --> 37:39.140]  we're definitely referring to the female for sure.
[37:39.140 --> 37:40.700]  Okay, cool.
[37:40.700 --> 37:41.540]  Okay.
[37:41.540 --> 37:42.700]  Yeah, sativa dominant plants,
[37:42.700 --> 37:44.900]  you can usually do week four, week five,
[37:44.900 --> 37:46.260]  usually typically a week or two later
[37:46.260 --> 37:47.460]  than you would an Indica.
[37:47.460 --> 37:49.060]  You really have to judge the flowering period
[37:49.060 --> 37:50.940]  if it's a nine, 10 week sativa.
[37:51.260 --> 37:52.300]  You want to leave,
[37:52.300 --> 37:54.100]  basically what you're leaving and looking for
[37:54.100 --> 37:56.300]  is about a four to five week gap
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.580]  of just the plants going through growth,
[37:58.580 --> 38:00.940]  normal, regular, solid growth
[38:00.940 --> 38:02.660]  for about four to five weeks.
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.820]  That's going to make that seed go from start to finish
[38:04.820 --> 38:06.020]  and really finish out nicely
[38:06.020 --> 38:09.860]  from start to embryo to seed to harvest.
[38:09.860 --> 38:10.700]  All right.
[38:10.700 --> 38:11.860]  So we've got pollen.
[38:11.860 --> 38:14.740]  When should we put our males and females
[38:14.740 --> 38:16.900]  into the flowering room at the same time?
[38:18.260 --> 38:20.860]  I think it really depends on your situation.
[38:21.620 --> 38:22.460]  The easiest way to do it
[38:22.460 --> 38:25.700]  if somebody's worried about getting cross-pollination
[38:25.700 --> 38:27.180]  with other females and things like that
[38:27.180 --> 38:29.380]  is to bring the female out of the room
[38:29.380 --> 38:30.580]  or use a smaller room,
[38:30.580 --> 38:32.820]  like maybe like a small two by two
[38:32.820 --> 38:34.340]  or three by three grow tent.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.620]  I've seen people even go down
[38:35.620 --> 38:36.900]  and use something as cheap
[38:36.900 --> 38:39.340]  as a very large cardboard box,
[38:39.340 --> 38:41.180]  like something for a refrigerator
[38:41.180 --> 38:43.260]  or like the largest box you can get at U-Haul.
[38:43.260 --> 38:44.100]  Okay.
[38:44.100 --> 38:45.140]  Put a CFL in it for your males,
[38:45.140 --> 38:46.140]  you know, and stuff like that
[38:46.140 --> 38:46.980]  and just let them go
[38:46.980 --> 38:48.060]  and then throw the female in there
[38:48.060 --> 38:50.220]  just for the day or two it needs to do its thing.
[38:51.060 --> 38:52.700]  You know, pull it back out.
[38:52.700 --> 38:54.380]  And then the deed is done,
[38:54.380 --> 38:55.540]  let it sit,
[38:55.540 --> 38:56.860]  spray it down with tap water,
[38:56.860 --> 38:58.340]  introduce it back into the flower room
[38:58.340 --> 38:59.580]  so you don't cross-pollinate.
[38:59.580 --> 39:00.540]  Okay.
[39:00.540 --> 39:01.380]  The way I do it,
[39:01.380 --> 39:02.780]  since when I pollinate,
[39:02.780 --> 39:03.620]  I do the whole room.
[39:03.620 --> 39:04.860]  I don't even fuck around.
[39:04.860 --> 39:06.940]  I know that I'm gonna do the entire room.
[39:06.940 --> 39:08.900]  So I'll get that male nice and beefy
[39:08.900 --> 39:10.100]  and when he's full of pollen
[39:10.100 --> 39:11.300]  and hopefully I've got him timed up
[39:11.300 --> 39:13.100]  to where my girls are about three to four weeks in,
[39:13.100 --> 39:13.940]  I just take him in there
[39:13.940 --> 39:14.940]  and put him in front of the fan
[39:14.940 --> 39:16.260]  and give him a good shake,
[39:16.260 --> 39:17.460]  smack the sticks a little bit
[39:17.460 --> 39:19.540]  and that pollen goes everywhere.
[39:20.060 --> 39:22.620]  But that's only if you're trying to do the whole room.
[39:22.620 --> 39:23.660]  If you're trying to time it
[39:23.660 --> 39:25.660]  and you don't know how long your male plant
[39:25.660 --> 39:27.980]  is going to take to start busting a nut,
[39:27.980 --> 39:30.220]  that's when it's time to flower him early
[39:30.220 --> 39:31.820]  and take pollen from him
[39:31.820 --> 39:33.980]  and collect the pollen into a container
[39:33.980 --> 39:36.660]  and then you can apply pollen to the branches you want
[39:36.660 --> 39:37.500]  or you can walk in there
[39:37.500 --> 39:40.300]  and hold that jar of pollen in front of a fan and shake it.
[39:40.300 --> 39:41.460]  You can kind of salt and pepper,
[39:41.460 --> 39:43.380]  sprinkle the plants if you'd like.
[39:43.380 --> 39:44.940]  There's several ways to apply the pollen.
[39:44.940 --> 39:46.620]  That's exactly how I do it as a breeder.
[39:46.620 --> 39:48.980]  I harvest pollen first
[39:48.980 --> 39:50.980]  and then choose females secondly.
[39:50.980 --> 39:51.820]  Okay.
[39:51.820 --> 39:52.660]  So I always harvest pollen.
[39:52.660 --> 39:53.980]  I keep good storage of pollen.
[39:53.980 --> 39:56.540]  A good way to store pollen is a good question.
[39:57.740 --> 39:58.900]  I get asked all the time,
[39:58.900 --> 40:01.020]  how do you store your pollen?
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.020]  I just use a very clean container.
[40:03.020 --> 40:04.620]  I wipe it out with alcohol first,
[40:04.620 --> 40:05.980]  let it dry really good
[40:05.980 --> 40:07.140]  and then wipe it out with water
[40:07.140 --> 40:08.460]  to make sure there's no alcohol left
[40:08.460 --> 40:10.140]  that's going to kill the pollen.
[40:10.140 --> 40:11.540]  And I don't use tap water.
[40:11.540 --> 40:13.420]  I use an RO water or distilled water.
[40:13.420 --> 40:14.820]  That way there's no chlorine present
[40:14.820 --> 40:16.460]  so it won't destroy the pollen.
[40:16.460 --> 40:17.300]  Right.
[40:17.300 --> 40:18.120]  Let it dry real well.
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.480]  You can use a dried rice is a really good thing to use.
[40:21.480 --> 40:22.920]  I've seen growers use dried rice,
[40:22.920 --> 40:25.480]  but the main thing is when you go to store pollen
[40:25.480 --> 40:27.560]  is to make sure there's no green material left over
[40:27.560 --> 40:29.920]  or any kind of bud material or leaf material
[40:29.920 --> 40:32.440]  present in the pollen whenever you're going through there
[40:32.440 --> 40:33.280]  after harvesting it.
[40:33.280 --> 40:34.880]  Because there's going to be little pieces here and there.
[40:34.880 --> 40:35.720]  And what that's going to do
[40:35.720 --> 40:37.880]  is it's going to create a moisture spot
[40:37.880 --> 40:38.720]  inside of that pollen
[40:38.720 --> 40:40.080]  and it's going to start molding.
[40:40.080 --> 40:40.920]  And that's where you can,
[40:40.920 --> 40:42.400]  because water breeds bacteria.
[40:42.400 --> 40:43.720]  That's basically what it boils down to
[40:43.720 --> 40:45.080]  and the bacteria is going to take over
[40:45.080 --> 40:47.400]  and it's going to render your pollen useless.
[40:47.600 --> 40:49.400]  I do a very similar method.
[40:49.400 --> 40:51.520]  I'll collect the pollen from the male
[40:51.520 --> 40:53.120]  and then I will have a clone of that male
[40:53.120 --> 40:55.440]  and I'll flower him right alongside my ladies
[40:55.440 --> 40:57.840]  so that I'm sure that right around the proper day,
[40:57.840 --> 40:59.720]  I know that each of my ladies will get dusted
[40:59.720 --> 41:01.560]  with the proper amount of pollen.
[41:01.560 --> 41:02.400]  There you go.
[41:02.400 --> 41:03.840]  So I'm double teaming it a little bit.
[41:03.840 --> 41:05.040]  And I'm kind of a weirdo.
[41:05.040 --> 41:06.480]  I might be a cannabis hoarder
[41:06.480 --> 41:08.720]  because I always like to keep a little bit of pollen.
[41:08.720 --> 41:10.120]  Like just in case something goes wrong,
[41:10.120 --> 41:11.680]  I've still got some of that pollen.
[41:11.680 --> 41:12.680]  That's what I love to do.
[41:12.680 --> 41:13.520]  Keep it back.
[41:13.520 --> 41:14.840]  You never know when you're going to come across something
[41:15.800 --> 41:17.120]  and say, you know,
[41:17.120 --> 41:19.160]  that one male would do really good with that female.
[41:19.160 --> 41:20.000]  Right.
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.280]  And it'd be a new cut that you just got
[41:21.280 --> 41:23.440]  and ran for the first time and you realize,
[41:23.440 --> 41:24.280]  hey, wait a minute,
[41:24.280 --> 41:26.240]  if I would have had that male or if I had that pollen,
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.840]  I could have just made a masterpiece.
[41:27.840 --> 41:28.680]  Yeah.
[41:28.680 --> 41:29.520]  Yeah.
[41:29.520 --> 41:30.520]  So I've got that pollen.
[41:30.520 --> 41:31.360]  Like you were saying,
[41:31.360 --> 41:32.760]  keep it in a clean jar or a container.
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.640]  I keep mine in a clean,
[41:33.640 --> 41:34.920]  those little tiny Mason jars,
[41:34.920 --> 41:36.840]  like a baby food size Mason jar.
[41:36.840 --> 41:38.680]  And then I keep that in a brown paper bag
[41:38.680 --> 41:39.840]  so there's no light getting to it.
[41:39.840 --> 41:42.880]  And then I actually put that in my spare refrigerator
[41:42.920 --> 41:45.200]  right next to my silver thiosulfate solution.
[41:45.200 --> 41:46.040]  Yeah.
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.520]  That's where it's next to the STS in the fridge.
[41:47.520 --> 41:48.360]  That's exactly where I store it.
[41:48.360 --> 41:50.360]  Is there a reason to keep it in the fridge
[41:50.360 --> 41:53.440]  other than just like the light and protection thing?
[41:53.440 --> 41:55.360]  I think cold is more preservative than heat.
[41:55.360 --> 41:56.200]  Exactly.
[41:56.200 --> 41:58.080]  I think things will deteriorate and degrade
[41:58.080 --> 42:00.000]  and shit goes wrong more quickly in heat.
[42:00.000 --> 42:00.840]  In nature,
[42:00.840 --> 42:02.080]  cold slows everything down.
[42:02.080 --> 42:02.920]  So that's,
[42:02.920 --> 42:04.320]  you keep your food and your meats and shit.
[42:04.320 --> 42:05.160]  I don't keep any meat,
[42:05.160 --> 42:06.000]  but I mean,
[42:06.000 --> 42:06.840]  if you do,
[42:06.840 --> 42:07.680]  you keep that shit in a fridge,
[42:07.680 --> 42:08.520]  keep it cool.
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.720]  It'll keep your pollen viable for longer.
[42:10.880 --> 42:13.360]  I also keep some seeds in a cooler
[42:13.360 --> 42:14.920]  and I haven't seen any difference
[42:14.920 --> 42:17.240]  in the seeds that I have kept not in a cooler
[42:17.240 --> 42:18.200]  and in a cooler.
[42:18.200 --> 42:19.440]  My other seeds go in a safe.
[42:19.440 --> 42:21.640]  I've got a big gun safe filled with seeds.
[42:21.640 --> 42:23.000]  The seeds that were in the cooler,
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.580]  I've germinated those with the same exact success rate
[42:25.580 --> 42:26.920]  as non-cooled seeds.
[42:26.920 --> 42:27.760]  Absolutely.
[42:27.760 --> 42:28.920]  Yeah.
[42:28.920 --> 42:29.760]  All right.
[42:29.760 --> 42:31.860]  So we know when to pollinate the plants.
[42:31.860 --> 42:34.520]  We know it's going to take about five to six weeks
[42:34.520 --> 42:35.360]  for those plants.
[42:35.360 --> 42:36.480]  Once the pollination happens,
[42:36.480 --> 42:38.880]  you'll see the pistils curl up.
[42:38.880 --> 42:40.220]  Right now they'll be clear looking,
[42:40.700 --> 42:41.540]  they're white,
[42:41.540 --> 42:42.980]  they're kind of like clear veiny white tips.
[42:42.980 --> 42:43.900]  Once that pollen hits,
[42:43.900 --> 42:45.540]  they're going to crinkle up like claws,
[42:45.540 --> 42:47.500]  like arthritis fingers.
[42:47.500 --> 42:49.280]  They're going to start turning brown.
[42:49.280 --> 42:50.880]  That's how you know the pollination has happened.
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.080]  Now the pollen is moving up the pistol
[42:54.080 --> 42:55.240]  and into the ovule
[42:55.240 --> 42:57.860]  and you're now actually making a seed.
[42:57.860 --> 42:59.860]  Let's talk a little bit about what to feed plants
[42:59.860 --> 43:02.740]  that we're putting seeds into.
[43:02.740 --> 43:04.140]  I like to give them a lot of carbs.
[43:04.140 --> 43:05.620]  I like to give them a lot of carbs and sugars.
[43:05.620 --> 43:06.460]  Lots of energy.
[43:06.460 --> 43:07.280]  And a good little bloom booster.
[43:07.280 --> 43:09.500]  That's about all I really do to them other than that.
[43:09.540 --> 43:11.300]  I do give them a little extra nitrogen and flour
[43:11.300 --> 43:12.180]  than I normally would
[43:12.180 --> 43:13.100]  because the plant's going to use
[43:13.100 --> 43:14.180]  a little bit of extra everything.
[43:14.180 --> 43:15.180]  Just like a mom would
[43:15.180 --> 43:17.180]  trying to create a baby inside of her.
[43:17.180 --> 43:19.740]  She's going to eat, she's got to eat too.
[43:19.740 --> 43:21.380]  So you got to take that concept
[43:21.380 --> 43:22.580]  and relay that into your plan.
[43:22.580 --> 43:24.540]  You know, you're creating thousands of seeds
[43:24.540 --> 43:25.380]  so those offspring,
[43:25.380 --> 43:27.580]  they need nutrients,
[43:27.580 --> 43:30.660]  they need food to be able to grow healthy and strong,
[43:30.660 --> 43:32.980]  just like a baby would or anything else would.
[43:32.980 --> 43:35.700]  Completely use as much light as possible.
[43:35.700 --> 43:36.540]  When you're breeding,
[43:36.540 --> 43:38.460]  light is definitely helpful.
[43:38.460 --> 43:39.980]  You'll multiply your amounts of seeds.
[43:39.980 --> 43:43.180]  If you step up from a 400 to a 600 to a thousand,
[43:43.180 --> 43:44.660]  you'll see the amount of seeds you produce
[43:44.660 --> 43:45.820]  and the quality of the seeds.
[43:45.820 --> 43:48.260]  Those little white seeds won't happen if you use a thousand.
[43:48.260 --> 43:50.060]  You only get those with a four or a six.
[43:50.060 --> 43:50.900]  That's it.
[43:50.900 --> 43:52.720]  Yeah, I actually use sixes.
[43:52.720 --> 43:54.260]  I do a 12-12 regimen
[43:54.260 --> 43:56.700]  when I go into flower for a breeding project.
[43:56.700 --> 43:57.540]  Yeah.
[43:57.540 --> 43:58.380]  Yeah.
[43:58.380 --> 43:59.200]  Yeah.
[43:59.200 --> 44:00.220]  But I actually, I use 600s,
[44:00.220 --> 44:01.740]  but even like you were saying,
[44:01.740 --> 44:05.020]  it will help mature faster with a brighter light source
[44:05.020 --> 44:06.260]  or hotter light source.
[44:06.900 --> 44:09.100]  So typically what I do like this time of year,
[44:09.100 --> 44:11.540]  I take them and put them outside for the last week to ripen,
[44:11.540 --> 44:13.220]  let the UV rays really taken over.
[44:13.220 --> 44:16.340]  And not only does it increase the THC
[44:16.340 --> 44:18.380]  and bombard the plant at all at one time,
[44:18.380 --> 44:20.980]  it really looks good on the charts after it's cut down.
[44:20.980 --> 44:21.820]  Oh, I bet.
[44:21.820 --> 44:22.660]  Yeah.
[44:22.660 --> 44:25.440]  There's something about making oil out of plants
[44:25.440 --> 44:26.780]  that were seeded.
[44:26.780 --> 44:27.620]  Once those plants,
[44:27.620 --> 44:28.820]  so we'll talk about this in a minute,
[44:28.820 --> 44:30.780]  but once the plants are finished,
[44:30.780 --> 44:31.860]  you take the seeds out
[44:31.860 --> 44:33.500]  and you've got a bunch of material left.
[44:33.500 --> 44:35.500]  I like to take that material to one of my good friends
[44:35.580 --> 44:37.300]  like Will that makes hash for me.
[44:37.300 --> 44:39.160]  And the concentrates that come out of that,
[44:39.160 --> 44:40.980]  you get such an amazing high.
[44:40.980 --> 44:43.140]  There's some, it's all, there's more of a,
[44:43.140 --> 44:45.180]  and you know, I don't get a psychedelic high,
[44:45.180 --> 44:47.180]  but it is more of a psychedelic feeling.
[44:47.180 --> 44:48.780]  You get more of a mind trip from it.
[44:48.780 --> 44:50.140]  You get more body high from it.
[44:50.140 --> 44:51.860]  It does something to the oil.
[44:51.860 --> 44:53.460]  It certainly does.
[44:53.460 --> 44:54.380]  All right.
[44:54.380 --> 44:56.960]  So we know what to feed the plants.
[44:56.960 --> 44:58.180]  Now we want to give them lots of carbs,
[44:58.180 --> 44:59.380]  a little more nitrogen.
[45:00.340 --> 45:01.420]  You're still going to have to flush
[45:01.420 --> 45:03.300]  just like you normally would before you cut down the plants.
[45:03.300 --> 45:04.420]  You guys keep that in mind.
[45:04.420 --> 45:05.260]  Always flush.
[45:06.020 --> 45:06.860]  I'm going to interrupt with something
[45:06.860 --> 45:08.740]  that I saw on Facebook.
[45:08.740 --> 45:09.700]  I won't call them out,
[45:09.700 --> 45:11.420]  but hopefully they listen to the podcast.
[45:11.420 --> 45:12.860]  They posted to Facebook.
[45:12.860 --> 45:14.540]  I found this stud male.
[45:14.540 --> 45:16.420]  Time to put him outside for the season
[45:16.420 --> 45:19.800]  and see what he can do so that I can collect some pollen
[45:19.800 --> 45:21.660]  is essentially what he said.
[45:21.660 --> 45:23.460]  So many bells went off in my head.
[45:23.460 --> 45:24.540]  I saw that post.
[45:26.900 --> 45:29.380]  Everybody for four miles of this dude
[45:29.380 --> 45:32.460]  that is growing outdoors is going to have a hybrid
[45:32.460 --> 45:34.700]  of whatever this dude put outside.
[45:35.580 --> 45:38.820]  The wind and nature are going to do their things.
[45:38.820 --> 45:40.900]  And this guy's going to pollinate
[45:40.900 --> 45:42.580]  the whole fucking neighborhood.
[45:43.460 --> 45:44.380]  Don't do that, you guys.
[45:44.380 --> 45:45.260]  If you've got a male plant,
[45:45.260 --> 45:47.060]  don't put it outside so that you can pollinate
[45:47.060 --> 45:48.100]  Rob's outdoor crops.
[45:48.100 --> 45:50.980]  And you can fucking pollinate everybody's outdoor crop.
[45:50.980 --> 45:52.000]  Don't do that shit.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.780]  Please be a thinkful thinker, a thinkful stoner.
[45:55.780 --> 45:57.420]  I don't even, be a forethinking grower
[45:57.420 --> 45:58.980]  is what I need you to be.
[45:58.980 --> 46:00.100]  Don't put that shit out there.
[46:00.100 --> 46:00.940]  That's rude.
[46:00.940 --> 46:01.780]  Please don't do that.
[46:02.620 --> 46:03.460]  Wow.
[46:03.460 --> 46:05.500]  These guys are shaking their heads in silence.
[46:05.500 --> 46:06.620]  They think they just want to stand up
[46:06.620 --> 46:08.620]  and walk away from the table now.
[46:08.620 --> 46:10.420]  They're like, fuck, I'm done.
[46:10.420 --> 46:11.260]  That's good.
[46:11.260 --> 46:13.860]  Yeah, you can take a cry break if you need to.
[46:13.860 --> 46:15.780]  People have taken naps on that couch over there.
[46:15.780 --> 46:18.100]  I'm sure a cry break would be acceptable.
[46:18.100 --> 46:20.760]  All right, so plants are going to grow about six weeks
[46:20.760 --> 46:23.600]  until the seeds are ready-ish.
[46:23.600 --> 46:26.420]  What should we start looking for during that time period
[46:26.420 --> 46:27.820]  to know if the seeds are getting ready
[46:27.820 --> 46:30.100]  or if we're going to have to let them go a little bit longer?
[46:30.100 --> 46:32.580]  Well, usually what I'll do if there's none,
[46:32.580 --> 46:36.280]  sometimes they'll split
[46:36.280 --> 46:38.020]  and you'll actually start seeing the seeds present
[46:38.020 --> 46:40.180]  on the plant.
[46:40.180 --> 46:41.340]  On the undersides of the buds,
[46:41.340 --> 46:42.500]  where the calyxes swell.
[46:42.500 --> 46:43.320]  That's it.
[46:43.320 --> 46:44.160]  The calyxes will split.
[46:44.160 --> 46:45.000]  They'll actually split
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.980]  and the seed will actually protrude from it sometimes,
[46:46.980 --> 46:47.820]  you know, when they're ripe.
[46:47.820 --> 46:49.780]  And then you'll actually see the visual seeds.
[46:49.780 --> 46:51.460]  You'll see a nice gray, dark color.
[46:51.460 --> 46:52.700]  You'll see nice tiger stripes.
[46:52.700 --> 46:53.820]  You know, the black tiger stripes
[46:53.820 --> 46:55.140]  is what you're looking for a lot of the time.
[46:55.140 --> 46:56.660]  Then you know you've got a nice ripe seed.
[46:56.660 --> 46:59.960]  You basically want to look for no green and no white.
[47:00.800 --> 47:01.640]  That's pretty much the two things
[47:01.640 --> 47:02.460]  you really got to look for.
[47:02.460 --> 47:03.360]  If there's no green and no white
[47:03.360 --> 47:04.240]  and you got tiger stripes
[47:04.240 --> 47:06.640]  and you got gray, nice gray seeds or dark seeds
[47:06.640 --> 47:09.200]  and typically, you know you're ready.
[47:09.200 --> 47:10.480]  A cheat move that I do
[47:11.680 --> 47:13.140]  after about six weeks of pollination,
[47:13.140 --> 47:14.680]  five and a half, six weeks of pollination,
[47:14.680 --> 47:17.480]  I wait and then right at the base of the buds
[47:17.480 --> 47:18.920]  where the stalk and the bud meet,
[47:18.920 --> 47:21.820]  there's usually one little calyx that swells up.
[47:21.820 --> 47:23.120]  I'll just pinch that fucker off
[47:23.120 --> 47:24.440]  and roll it around in my hand.
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.640]  And you'll know it's either a seed
[47:26.640 --> 47:29.280]  or what would have been a seed had you not destroyed it.
[47:29.280 --> 47:30.400]  And you guys don't worry about crushing
[47:30.400 --> 47:31.240]  one or two of those
[47:31.240 --> 47:32.360]  because if you did this correctly,
[47:32.360 --> 47:35.200]  you're going to have at least 100, closer to 500
[47:35.200 --> 47:37.300]  if you do it like Rob and I do.
[47:37.300 --> 47:40.120]  I've pulled 5,000 seeds from a plant before easily.
[47:40.120 --> 47:41.840]  I'm looking at pulling like around at least 1,000
[47:41.840 --> 47:43.480]  or two from one plant right now.
[47:43.480 --> 47:45.280]  I was running seven gallon pots
[47:45.280 --> 47:46.480]  and hitting them with big mails.
[47:46.480 --> 47:47.320]  I'm running 10.
[47:47.320 --> 47:48.160]  Yeah.
[47:48.160 --> 47:49.760]  Pull quite a few.
[47:49.760 --> 47:52.680]  Yeah, thousands of seeds can come from one plant.
[47:52.680 --> 47:53.920]  Where the hell were we?
[47:53.920 --> 47:54.740]  How long to let it go?
[47:54.740 --> 47:55.580]  What to look for?
[47:55.580 --> 47:57.160]  You can pinch that one little,
[47:57.160 --> 47:58.300]  you guys will see what I'm talking about.
[47:58.300 --> 47:59.500]  If you've got a seeded crop
[47:59.500 --> 48:01.180]  and a lot of times you'll see these little calyxes
[48:01.180 --> 48:02.020]  on the bottoms of buds
[48:02.020 --> 48:03.900]  and they'll make you think you've got a seed.
[48:03.900 --> 48:06.980]  Yeah, I did want to touch on letting them go
[48:06.980 --> 48:07.940]  a little bit too long.
[48:07.940 --> 48:09.820]  What happens with the ramifications
[48:09.820 --> 48:11.860]  of letting your seeds go too terribly long
[48:11.860 --> 48:14.380]  letting the plant just basically go into the point where
[48:14.380 --> 48:15.900]  A, you're going to lose most of your THC.
[48:15.900 --> 48:19.180]  It's going to convert over to CBD and things like that.
[48:19.180 --> 48:21.100]  And then secondly,
[48:21.100 --> 48:23.660]  Not in the progeny, in the bud that's actually growing.
[48:23.660 --> 48:25.900]  I don't know if you've ever had those seeds,
[48:25.900 --> 48:28.420]  had a batch of seeds from somebody or a breeder
[48:28.420 --> 48:31.380]  that you've gotten in and they're just hard as a rock.
[48:31.380 --> 48:34.020]  And they got really great dark, the real dark, nice
[48:34.020 --> 48:36.060]  but I mean, they're just incredibly hard as rock.
[48:36.060 --> 48:37.860]  A lot of them have to be scored germinate.
[48:37.860 --> 48:38.700]  Yeah.
[48:38.700 --> 48:39.520]  Yeah.
[48:39.520 --> 48:40.360]  That's what that's from.
[48:40.360 --> 48:41.180]  That's a lot of it.
[48:41.180 --> 48:42.020]  Basically what it is,
[48:42.020 --> 48:43.820]  it's because the seed is this embryo
[48:43.820 --> 48:45.500]  and it's developing a shell.
[48:45.500 --> 48:46.620]  That's developing that shell
[48:46.620 --> 48:48.620]  and that shell is going to do nothing but like a bone.
[48:48.620 --> 48:50.800]  It's going to get harder and harder and harder.
[48:50.800 --> 48:52.060]  The more you pump that plant
[48:52.060 --> 48:54.180]  and especially it comes from not ripening the plant
[48:54.180 --> 48:57.340]  correctly also, not flushing properly, things like that.
[48:57.340 --> 48:59.140]  Because you got so many nutrients present
[48:59.140 --> 49:01.580]  it's still telling it to drive, drive, drive, drive.
[49:01.580 --> 49:03.500]  So it's going to create that and develop that.
[49:03.500 --> 49:05.700]  And that's also when you risk seed splitting.
[49:05.700 --> 49:08.140]  Seed splitting will happen because whenever you pull them out
[49:08.140 --> 49:09.500]  they're going to be so overdeveloped
[49:09.500 --> 49:10.760]  that once they start to dry out
[49:10.760 --> 49:12.140]  they're going to start cracking and splitting
[49:12.140 --> 49:13.360]  because it's going to be like,
[49:13.360 --> 49:16.400]  there's going to be such a large embryo inside of this shell
[49:16.400 --> 49:17.980]  because it's swelled up inside of there.
[49:17.980 --> 49:19.340]  It's growing, you know?
[49:19.340 --> 49:20.700]  So you're going to have a lot of problems
[49:20.700 --> 49:21.620]  can develop from that.
[49:21.620 --> 49:22.820]  And that's a lot of the issues
[49:22.820 --> 49:24.160]  when people have these little issues
[49:24.160 --> 49:25.640]  with seeds when they get them in the mail
[49:25.640 --> 49:26.840]  and things like that from different breeders
[49:26.840 --> 49:29.160]  and they are cracked and stuff, but they haven't been
[49:29.160 --> 49:30.960]  the package is fine and they come great.
[49:30.960 --> 49:33.120]  But the, but you got a couple of cracked seeds in there
[49:33.120 --> 49:33.960]  and they look great and everything
[49:33.960 --> 49:36.560]  but you can tell just the shell split right down the side,
[49:36.560 --> 49:38.320]  you know, and you're like, Hey, this is not going to be good
[49:38.320 --> 49:40.440]  because the embryos now dried out and dead.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.160]  So that seeds toast, you know,
[49:42.160 --> 49:43.680]  and then you get some that you have to score
[49:43.680 --> 49:46.440]  because they just will not germinate unless you score them.
[49:46.440 --> 49:47.280]  That's a lot of-
[49:47.280 --> 49:48.240]  Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[49:48.240 --> 49:50.380]  What's the best way to do, you guys, you'll know
[49:50.380 --> 49:52.440]  if the seeds are super hard, really thick shell
[49:52.440 --> 49:53.600]  you'll be able to tell by looking
[49:54.040 --> 49:54.880]  at the seeds, they'll be extra glossy.
[49:54.880 --> 49:56.120]  There'll be a little harder than normal.
[49:56.120 --> 49:58.160]  If it's your first pack of seeds, you don't have anything
[49:58.160 --> 50:00.000]  to compare it to, so you're just going to have to learn
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.640]  but what's the best way to score them
[50:01.640 --> 50:03.360]  to soften them up a little bit to grow.
[50:03.360 --> 50:05.280]  If you've got a matchbook, that's a real good way to do it.
[50:05.280 --> 50:07.040]  If you've got a matchbook, use the side of a matchbook
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.560]  just rub them like that or really fine grit sandpaper.
[50:09.560 --> 50:10.720]  You don't want to use a coarse grade
[50:10.720 --> 50:11.560]  because it's going to tear it
[50:11.560 --> 50:12.840]  and it's going to tear into it really hard.
[50:12.840 --> 50:14.560]  So you want to use a really fine grit sandpaper
[50:14.560 --> 50:16.280]  is one of the easiest things really to use.
[50:16.280 --> 50:18.400]  I like to just soak those plants, put a little bit
[50:18.400 --> 50:20.480]  a couple of drops of hygrosiam and a glass of water
[50:20.480 --> 50:22.680]  or a jar of water and just let those plants soak
[50:22.680 --> 50:26.720]  for about 24 hours and then put them in the paper towel
[50:26.720 --> 50:27.760]  and drip them like normal.
[50:27.760 --> 50:29.040]  Yeah, that usually works for me.
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.800]  Another one I use is Dr. Willard's plant catalyst.
[50:31.800 --> 50:33.440]  Okay, that's a good shit.
[50:33.440 --> 50:34.560]  That is a really good product.
[50:34.560 --> 50:36.320]  I've never talked about that on the podcast.
[50:36.320 --> 50:37.840]  They gave me a free bottle of it.
[50:37.840 --> 50:39.080]  They got to give me a case.
[50:39.080 --> 50:41.360]  30 to 60 mils in your reservoir, he said.
[50:41.360 --> 50:43.240]  And I go, well, how do you know how big my reservoir is?
[50:43.240 --> 50:46.120]  He goes, it doesn't matter what this, you put 30 to 60 mils
[50:46.120 --> 50:48.000]  in here and it'll make your plants go faster.
[50:48.000 --> 50:48.840]  And it did.
[50:48.840 --> 50:50.440]  I could see them absorbing more nutrients.
[50:51.280 --> 50:52.120]  We did a side by side with seeds.
[50:52.120 --> 50:53.040]  We took blueberry fuel.
[50:53.040 --> 50:54.480]  We took about 10 of them, germinated them
[50:54.480 --> 50:55.440]  with regular tap water.
[50:55.440 --> 50:58.840]  And then we germinated out of the same group
[50:58.840 --> 51:01.000]  another 10 seeds, Dr. Willard's and tap water,
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.560]  24 hour difference.
[51:02.560 --> 51:03.400]  I was amazed.
[51:03.400 --> 51:05.480]  Every one of those seeds germinated within 24 hours.
[51:05.480 --> 51:06.320]  It was like-
[51:06.320 --> 51:07.160]  It's nice.
[51:07.160 --> 51:08.000]  Crazy.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.640]  Yeah, and then the regular tap waters took about 36 to 48.
[51:10.640 --> 51:11.920]  So it was a dramatic difference.
[51:11.920 --> 51:13.760]  You could see it was like overnight, you know,
[51:13.760 --> 51:14.840]  versus the next day.
[51:14.840 --> 51:16.120]  It was like, it was pretty wild.
[51:16.120 --> 51:17.160]  I was like, that's some good stuff.
[51:17.160 --> 51:18.840]  So we use it religiously.
[51:18.880 --> 51:21.320]  So shout out to Dr. Willard's plant catalyst.
[51:21.320 --> 51:24.240]  If you want to send us stuff, get in touch.
[51:24.240 --> 51:25.920]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[51:25.920 --> 51:27.480]  We'd love to help you out.
[51:27.480 --> 51:28.320]  That'd be cool.
[51:29.400 --> 51:30.240]  All right.
[51:30.240 --> 51:31.440]  So if you leave them in there too long, you guys,
[51:31.440 --> 51:32.560]  your seeds will start splitting.
[51:32.560 --> 51:33.800]  So pay attention.
[51:33.800 --> 51:34.640]  Also check it out.
[51:34.640 --> 51:35.480]  I want to mention this.
[51:35.480 --> 51:36.840]  This is something that comes to mind.
[51:36.840 --> 51:39.680]  If your plants start dropping seeds,
[51:39.680 --> 51:41.960]  if you have more than one female in the room
[51:41.960 --> 51:43.920]  and seeds fall out of your plant,
[51:43.920 --> 51:45.800]  you can't just pick that seed up and assume
[51:45.800 --> 51:47.320]  that it came from this girl.
[51:47.320 --> 51:49.640]  That could have came from any of the females in the room
[51:49.640 --> 51:50.920]  and it could have rolled to that spot.
[51:50.920 --> 51:53.480]  So you can't label that one what you think it fell from.
[51:53.480 --> 51:55.880]  You can only label seeds what you're fucking sure
[51:55.880 --> 51:56.960]  it came from.
[51:56.960 --> 51:58.600]  Don't ever guess when labeling a seed.
[51:58.600 --> 52:01.400]  That is the future of the cannabis genome.
[52:01.400 --> 52:02.960]  And we don't want any confusion.
[52:02.960 --> 52:05.040]  It's your job as a person breeding
[52:05.040 --> 52:07.680]  to take beautiful notes for the future.
[52:07.680 --> 52:08.520]  Please do that.
[52:08.520 --> 52:09.880]  For example, I just had a crop
[52:09.880 --> 52:11.880]  and we popped the seed out of it earlier.
[52:12.840 --> 52:14.720]  That goes in the happy accident bag.
[52:14.720 --> 52:16.200]  Yes, happy accidents are a good thing
[52:16.200 --> 52:18.840]  when you're in the seed business or the breeding game.
[52:18.840 --> 52:19.680]  Those don't ever make it out to the public.
[52:19.680 --> 52:22.200]  I have a really, really great idea where it come.
[52:22.200 --> 52:24.520]  I'm almost like 90% sure where it came from,
[52:24.520 --> 52:27.840]  but I still label this so and put happy accident.
[52:27.840 --> 52:30.840]  And then I'll pop that seed and it'll get a whole new name
[52:30.840 --> 52:32.320]  and a whole new thing.
[52:32.320 --> 52:34.960]  If it stays around, it could be the next hottest clone only.
[52:34.960 --> 52:36.800]  It could be because more than likely
[52:36.800 --> 52:37.760]  it's gonna go in the trash.
[52:37.760 --> 52:39.360]  A lot of the super popular shit
[52:39.360 --> 52:40.760]  was an accident just like that.
[52:40.760 --> 52:42.080]  Well, that's what I try to explain people.
[52:42.080 --> 52:43.720]  It's more about selection and not numbers.
[52:43.720 --> 52:44.840]  You can pop a vegan seeds
[52:44.840 --> 52:46.240]  if you're not good at selecting those plants.
[52:46.240 --> 52:47.960]  What does a vegan seeds worth?
[52:47.960 --> 52:48.920]  Yeah.
[52:48.920 --> 52:50.640]  Oh man, I found some beautiful keepers
[52:50.640 --> 52:52.000]  that most people would have just tossed.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.760]  I can name 10 of the world's most legendary strange right now
[52:54.760 --> 52:56.760]  that all came from five seeds.
[52:56.760 --> 52:57.600]  Chemdog.
[52:57.600 --> 52:58.760]  Gorilla glue number four.
[52:58.760 --> 52:59.960]  Yep.
[52:59.960 --> 53:01.760]  Girl Scout cookies.
[53:01.760 --> 53:03.200]  Oh, Gainesville green.
[53:03.200 --> 53:04.480]  Okay, nice.
[53:04.480 --> 53:06.600]  I don't know enough about the Florida weed.
[53:06.600 --> 53:08.960]  Yeah, a lot of the most pop, we had a white.
[53:08.960 --> 53:11.560]  We actually did a whole episode about accidents
[53:11.560 --> 53:12.600]  and clone only accidents.
[53:12.600 --> 53:13.840]  East coast sour D.
[53:13.880 --> 53:14.920]  Golden goats.
[53:14.920 --> 53:16.120]  West coast sour D.
[53:17.560 --> 53:19.960]  OG Kush, Bubba Kush.
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.720]  All right, so it's your job as a breeder, you guys.
[53:21.720 --> 53:24.520]  Please be careful to carefully mark everything.
[53:24.520 --> 53:25.720]  Make sure you label everything.
[53:25.720 --> 53:27.120]  Don't make any mistakes for the future
[53:27.120 --> 53:29.560]  because you're gonna be growing these seeds
[53:29.560 --> 53:30.480]  and hopefully some of your friends
[53:30.480 --> 53:31.320]  are gonna be growing them
[53:31.320 --> 53:33.560]  and you don't wanna mislead people on what is in there.
[53:33.560 --> 53:36.120]  A lot of this stuff is going to be aimed at medical patients
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.760]  and we want the medical patients to know the genetics
[53:38.760 --> 53:39.600]  of what they're getting.
[53:39.600 --> 53:40.920]  It's really helpful.
[53:40.920 --> 53:41.760]  Absolutely.
[53:41.760 --> 53:43.160]  So if you find some seeds on the floor,
[53:43.160 --> 53:44.000]  you can use them.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.680]  You just gotta be careful
[53:45.680 --> 53:47.080]  and carefully think about what they are.
[53:47.080 --> 53:49.520]  Don't try to say it's this times this until you grow it.
[53:49.520 --> 53:51.560]  And if you're certain, then you could be cool with that.
[53:51.560 --> 53:52.520]  Sure.
[53:52.520 --> 53:53.360]  All right, so.
[53:53.360 --> 53:54.880]  If it's an unknown, just label it an unknown.
[53:54.880 --> 53:56.000]  That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.480]  I've seen some of the biggest, largest breeders
[53:57.480 --> 54:00.480]  in the world label their genetics unknown crossed with this.
[54:00.480 --> 54:02.720]  Yeah, Gage has a special name for those.
[54:02.720 --> 54:03.760]  Yeah, from us.
[54:03.760 --> 54:04.600]  Or name it, yeah.
[54:04.600 --> 54:07.120]  Like Gage's number one male, Joseph.
[54:07.120 --> 54:10.040]  That Joseph male that they used for years and years
[54:10.040 --> 54:10.880]  and years and years,
[54:11.320 --> 54:13.320]  it's a bag seed male from somewhere
[54:13.320 --> 54:14.400]  and nobody knows what it was.
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.400]  So they just named it Joseph OG.
[54:16.400 --> 54:18.480]  And they labeled it properly as so,
[54:18.480 --> 54:20.560]  and then everybody knows that or we wouldn't know that.
[54:20.560 --> 54:23.000]  You can actually buy Gage's unlabeled seeds
[54:23.000 --> 54:23.840]  and they've got a name.
[54:23.840 --> 54:25.360]  I don't remember what they're called,
[54:25.360 --> 54:26.800]  but you can buy them.
[54:26.800 --> 54:28.800]  They're all the seeds that fell to the side.
[54:28.800 --> 54:31.640]  They're called good ideas is what his extra seeds are called.
[54:31.640 --> 54:32.840]  He calls them good ideas.
[54:32.840 --> 54:33.680]  There you go.
[54:33.680 --> 54:34.500]  Yeah, they're a good idea,
[54:34.500 --> 54:35.920]  but I don't know what it's gonna be.
[54:35.920 --> 54:36.760]  That's it.
[54:36.760 --> 54:37.600]  All right, so let's get back
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.440]  to our little breeding project here for Fred.
[54:39.440 --> 54:41.240]  We've got plants with seeds in them.
[54:41.240 --> 54:42.080]  They've been pollinated.
[54:42.080 --> 54:45.040]  They've gone five and a half, six-ish weeks
[54:45.040 --> 54:46.600]  since the pollen has hit them.
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.320]  The pistils are curly and brown.
[54:48.320 --> 54:49.900]  The trichomes are starting to amber up.
[54:49.900 --> 54:51.400]  The plants are getting mature.
[54:52.480 --> 54:54.120]  Let's start flushing the plants.
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.580]  And now let's talk about pulling down the plants
[54:56.580 --> 54:58.840]  and getting the seeds out of these sons of bitches.
[54:58.840 --> 54:59.720]  Right on.
[54:59.720 --> 55:01.760]  I harvest them just like I harvest
[55:01.760 --> 55:02.720]  any other regular plant.
[55:02.720 --> 55:05.640]  I take it down, take away any water leaf, anything,
[55:05.640 --> 55:08.360]  basically do a light wet trim.
[55:08.360 --> 55:11.320]  And then I just hang them and let them dry.
[55:11.320 --> 55:14.320]  And after one, I let them dry a little bit longer
[55:14.320 --> 55:16.460]  than normal because they are seeded plants.
[55:16.460 --> 55:18.280]  They have a denser texture to them.
[55:18.280 --> 55:20.080]  They're a lot more dense than regular buds.
[55:20.080 --> 55:21.600]  I mean, they're hard as a rock.
[55:21.600 --> 55:24.080]  So you gotta really let them dry out a little longer.
[55:24.080 --> 55:26.000]  And then after they're done,
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.120]  you just kind of carefully roll them in your hands.
[55:28.120 --> 55:29.960]  That's what all I do is just carefully roll them
[55:29.960 --> 55:31.560]  and I just let the seeds fall,
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.320]  not from a high place, but from a low spot.
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.000]  Six inches or lower above your table or sifting tray.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.320]  When you buy a package of ball jars or Kerr jars,
[55:41.320 --> 55:43.480]  little Mason jars, it comes with that cardboard base
[55:43.480 --> 55:44.320]  to keep them in place.
[55:44.320 --> 55:46.440]  I love to use that thing or go to the liquor store
[55:46.440 --> 55:48.620]  and get something that they just put cases of beer in,
[55:48.620 --> 55:49.580]  just a little flat one.
[55:49.580 --> 55:51.440]  It's about three or four inches deep
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.300]  and the seeds won't bounce off the cardboard.
[55:54.300 --> 55:55.960]  Sorry, excuse me for clearing the throat so many times.
[55:55.960 --> 55:57.520]  We took so many dabs today.
[55:57.520 --> 55:58.880]  The seeds won't bounce off the cardboard.
[55:58.880 --> 56:01.220]  I used to try to use a cookie sheet or a Pyrex dish,
[56:01.220 --> 56:03.560]  but then you take these buds that are filled with seeds
[56:03.560 --> 56:04.800]  and they're dry and you crumble them up.
[56:04.800 --> 56:06.180]  And if you do it right, you guys,
[56:06.180 --> 56:07.900]  it's gonna sound like it's raining.
[56:08.740 --> 56:10.020]  It's gonna go to tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee tee
[56:10.020 --> 56:12.580]  and seeds are gonna come raining out of these buds.
[56:12.580 --> 56:15.460]  Use cardboard because they will not bounce as badly
[56:15.460 --> 56:18.780]  as they will out of a cookie sheet or a Pyrex dish.
[56:18.780 --> 56:21.260]  So I usually just, like you said, let the buds dry.
[56:21.260 --> 56:22.540]  Then I roll them up in my hands,
[56:22.540 --> 56:24.020]  crumble them up a little bit.
[56:24.020 --> 56:27.080]  Wear a rubber glove because you're gonna get sticky as shit
[56:27.080 --> 56:28.220]  or don't, if you're into that.
[56:28.220 --> 56:30.380]  Some people like to get that resin all over their hands.
[56:30.380 --> 56:32.260]  Our friend Rusty, shout out to Rusty.
[56:32.260 --> 56:33.780]  He likes to pick seeds without gloves
[56:33.780 --> 56:34.940]  and be all dark fingered.
[56:34.940 --> 56:35.780]  That's me.
[56:37.100 --> 56:38.140]  I got shit to do.
[56:38.140 --> 56:40.420]  Yeah, I got, unless I'm playing with cocoa,
[56:40.420 --> 56:41.260]  I'm wearing gloves.
[56:41.260 --> 56:43.100]  I like to play with the cocoa barehanded.
[56:43.100 --> 56:44.720]  That cocoa just cleans your hands.
[56:44.720 --> 56:45.560]  If your hands are filthy,
[56:45.560 --> 56:47.460]  just go stick them in the cocoa and mix them around.
[56:47.460 --> 56:49.100]  Your hands will be shiny again.
[56:49.100 --> 56:50.180]  Shit's rad.
[56:50.180 --> 56:52.620]  All right, so now we've got a bunch of dried bud material,
[56:52.620 --> 56:54.460]  basically, and a bunch of seeds.
[56:54.460 --> 56:56.260]  Depending on the size of your garden,
[56:56.260 --> 56:57.860]  there's a whole bunch of different ways to go
[56:57.860 --> 57:01.340]  and try to pull these seeds out of your buds.
[57:01.340 --> 57:02.500]  I should mention this while we're here
[57:02.500 --> 57:04.960]  because we're all stoned and we might fuck up.
[57:04.960 --> 57:07.540]  Keep your female plants separate at this point.
[57:07.540 --> 57:10.500]  If you're working with more than one varietal,
[57:10.500 --> 57:14.360]  more than one strain of females in this breeding project,
[57:14.360 --> 57:15.580]  keep the bitches separate
[57:15.580 --> 57:18.220]  because you don't want to get your seeds confused.
[57:18.220 --> 57:20.700]  You want to have carefully labeled seeds.
[57:20.700 --> 57:22.380]  That's the whole part of why you're breeding
[57:22.380 --> 57:24.340]  is so that you can know what's going on.
[57:24.340 --> 57:25.780]  So keep the girls separated.
[57:25.780 --> 57:27.980]  If you find seeds on the floor in the dry room,
[57:27.980 --> 57:30.020]  once again, those are good ideas.
[57:30.020 --> 57:33.020]  Don't label those unless you're certain of what they are.
[57:33.020 --> 57:34.080]  So now we've got all this material.
[57:34.080 --> 57:35.340]  If you've got a little crop,
[57:35.340 --> 57:37.060]  if your garden is kind of small,
[57:37.060 --> 57:38.900]  you can simply do the old school method
[57:38.900 --> 57:41.620]  where you put the little container at an angle
[57:41.620 --> 57:43.140]  and slide the weed up to the top
[57:43.140 --> 57:44.380]  and the seeds will roll to the bottom
[57:44.380 --> 57:46.180]  and the dried weed material will stay at the top.
[57:46.180 --> 57:48.380]  You just get you a good tray, a good magazine,
[57:48.380 --> 57:50.980]  whatever floats your boat, 45 degree angle,
[57:50.980 --> 57:52.420]  a pack of rolling papers.
[57:52.420 --> 57:54.660]  Put on some music and just go at it.
[57:54.660 --> 57:56.660]  Put all those seeds in a jar and let it go.
[57:56.660 --> 57:59.060]  That's the cheapest, easiest way to do it.
[57:59.060 --> 58:00.860]  But if you're doing it on a level
[58:00.860 --> 58:02.660]  to where you've got a seed company,
[58:02.660 --> 58:04.460]  that's gonna get tedious really quickly.
[58:04.460 --> 58:06.780]  You and your friends can only sit around for so long
[58:06.780 --> 58:08.540]  and you're gonna have to give away so many packs of seeds
[58:08.540 --> 58:11.420]  to everyone that helps you for breaking their back.
[58:11.420 --> 58:16.300]  So they do sell a, my good friends at Mile High Seed Company,
[58:16.300 --> 58:17.460]  shout out to the Mile High Seed Company.
[58:17.460 --> 58:18.340]  They showed me a device.
[58:18.340 --> 58:20.580]  It's actually a bird seed separator.
[58:20.580 --> 58:21.420]  That thing is sweet.
[58:21.420 --> 58:22.700]  You pour all your material.
[58:22.700 --> 58:24.060]  Yeah, you pour your material into the top
[58:24.060 --> 58:25.660]  and it's got a little hand crank on it
[58:25.660 --> 58:27.220]  and it just spits seeds out one side
[58:27.220 --> 58:29.000]  and all the other material falls right out of the bottom.
[58:29.940 --> 58:32.160]  You can actually buy a fully automatic one nowadays.
[58:32.160 --> 58:34.240]  It actually separates everything for you and everything.
[58:34.240 --> 58:38.040]  It likes to separate your trim and everything from your seed
[58:38.040 --> 58:39.240]  so you'll have it in one pile.
[58:39.240 --> 58:41.160]  It has a nice column and then it'll have
[58:41.160 --> 58:44.000]  a clear container below it that actually sips the seeds.
[58:44.000 --> 58:44.920]  You can get them on eBay.
[58:44.920 --> 58:47.040]  Just look up Parrot Seed Cleaning Machine.
[58:47.880 --> 58:48.840]  How much are they?
[58:48.840 --> 58:52.680]  They run, your price point's gonna be about $159 to 200 bucks.
[58:52.680 --> 58:53.520]  Fred, buy one.
[58:53.520 --> 58:54.340]  It's worth it.
[58:54.340 --> 58:56.200]  Just the time that you, it's like trimming.
[58:56.200 --> 58:57.040]  It's instant.
[58:57.040 --> 58:59.520]  Trimming is fun the first seven times
[58:59.520 --> 59:01.440]  but after, once you've trimmed 10 times,
[59:01.440 --> 59:03.720]  you wanna put the scissors in your eye.
[59:03.720 --> 59:05.440]  Basically the concept was, you know,
[59:05.440 --> 59:07.280]  I was actually a zoologist for two years.
[59:07.280 --> 59:09.200]  That's how I knew about them.
[59:09.200 --> 59:11.320]  Basically what it is is parrots and birds,
[59:11.320 --> 59:14.880]  whenever you rear birds in an aviary,
[59:14.880 --> 59:17.680]  they waste about 75 to 80% of the food.
[59:17.680 --> 59:19.280]  They're really picky eaters.
[59:19.280 --> 59:20.560]  So they kinda go through the food
[59:20.560 --> 59:21.960]  and sit through what they want at the time
[59:21.960 --> 59:23.840]  and throw the rest in the ground.
[59:23.840 --> 59:25.880]  So basically you take all your bird feed
[59:25.880 --> 59:28.080]  that you buy in the store that's quite expensive
[59:28.080 --> 59:29.680]  for these parrots and stuff like that
[59:29.680 --> 59:31.280]  and you run it through the machine
[59:31.280 --> 59:33.720]  and you get like 70% return back
[59:33.720 --> 59:35.400]  and you just keep recycling until it's all gone.
[59:35.400 --> 59:36.520]  Birds are dicks.
[59:36.520 --> 59:37.840]  Birds are pains in the ass.
[59:37.840 --> 59:40.160]  They're little bastards.
[59:41.320 --> 59:43.540]  All right, so now, oh God, excuse me guys.
[59:43.540 --> 59:45.040]  I apologize for that.
[59:45.040 --> 59:46.200]  I'm gonna blame that on this hitman
[59:46.200 --> 59:48.200]  or the mothership rig that Will brought over.
[59:48.200 --> 59:49.400]  Thanks for bringing over the mothership.
[59:49.400 --> 59:50.220]  That was rad.
[59:50.220 --> 59:52.800]  Oh, and shout out to this distillate.
[59:52.800 --> 59:54.320]  I'm not sure if we could talk about too much
[59:54.320 --> 59:55.720]  where this distillate came from
[59:56.560 --> 59:57.400]  but I've got a friend out there named Frosty
[59:57.400 --> 59:59.480]  who I owe a huge shout out to.
[59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.320]  Yeah.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.800]  If you guys wanna link those two together, you can
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.400]  but I don't know if they're related.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.400]  All right, we've got a bunch of seeds.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.560]  We've got a bunch of material.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.520]  We've pulled, we put our seeds into the little bird feeder.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.800]  We put all our stuff into the bird feeder.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.840]  We pulled the seeds and the material out.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.040]  You can smoke that material
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.200]  or you can make hash out of that material
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.040]  or you can make edibles out of that material.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.040]  There are so many uses for that material, you guys.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.520]  It is still good quality product.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.040]  You can roll joints out of it and smoke it.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.280]  I like to give it to my friend, Will
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.640]  and let him make BHO out of it for me.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.840]  It works really well.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.620]  The high from it, like I said earlier, is amazing.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.620]  You can also make oil out of it, make edibles out of it.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.880]  You can make butter out of it.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.000]  You can do anything that you would do
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.320]  with any other buds out of that material.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.840]  So seeds, there is controversy online.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.960]  Do seeds need to cure?
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.040]  I believe they do.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.360]  If, and it also all depends on,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.380]  that's not where I feel the controversy comes from
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.260]  but it's climate, it's climatic.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.100]  Yeah.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.100]  It's where the controversy comes from.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.220]  Coming from the deep swamp and the floor
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.460]  to the 100% humidity, 106 degree days
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.700]  every single day of the week is wet.
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.980]  The air is like soup.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.880]  You have to cure seeds for like three or four weeks
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.720]  to get them to germinate.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.180]  He said the air is like soup.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.380]  It is like that in the South, it's bad.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.620]  I've been to some festivals down South and it killed me.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.460]  It's terrible.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.700]  I was walking, I was at a festival just walking
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.420]  and I was covered in sweat and I thought I was okay
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.500]  but I looked around at my friends, I was like,
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.020]  you know what, fucking I'm sitting down.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:25.860]  And everyone's like, you okay?
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.140]  And I was like, I'm cool but I'm too fucking hot.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.500]  I'm going to sit down right now.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.340]  Exactly.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.060]  And I just needed a minute just to not be
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.620]  so damn hot for a minute.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.900]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.180]  It's real muggy and that's a lot of the humidity
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.540]  and things like that.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.180]  The higher the humidity,
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.340]  the longer you'll have to cure your seeds.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.740]  One of the best tricks I've learned
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.980]  since I moved over here to Colorado
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.540]  takes about three or four days to cure.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.380]  Yeah.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:53.240]  And I back a four bowl, two foot long T5 fixture.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.740]  And I back it off about two to three feet off a pan
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.420]  and I let the UV and all the UV rays and everything
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.980]  cure the seeds in about three days.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.660]  And I swear they jump right out of the seed.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.500]  Okay.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.780]  As soon as the seed hits water,
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.460]  I mean, they want to fly right out.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.660]  And then all of our testers came back 100% germination.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.500]  Very cool.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.860]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds of seeds.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.700]  Nice.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.540]  I mean, it was just like, that was a good thing.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.380]  And there's also a few dry ice methods.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:20.180]  Are you looking for any testers?
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.020]  Always, always looking for good testers
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.740]  willing to put in the effort and throw back the result.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.420]  That's what we're always looking for.
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.820]  A lot of people hit me up to be a tester.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:31.900]  I'm sure people hit you up.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.260]  Let's just give these guys an idea
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.060]  of who is a qualified tester
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.860]  so that we don't have to keep typing these emails.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.700]  That's right.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.300]  Well, I'm looking for at least
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.420]  minimum three to five years experience.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.220]  I want you to pretty much have already run
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.900]  through every book there is on the planet
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.060]  that you can get your hands on,
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.540]  the resource material that's out there,
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.780]  because you're given all this free resource material
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.500]  nowadays, especially with the internet
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.340]  and things like that,
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.940]  that there's no really excuse for you
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.780]  not to educate yourself.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.780]  You have it right in front of your face
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.820]  to educate yourself.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.580]  That's the first number one thing I can tell any growers,
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.140]  educate yourself, and that's going to make you
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:06.980]  a better grower.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.020]  Everybody always, what can I do to make my plants better?
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.260]  What can I do to learn this?
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.100]  Educate yourself.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.020]  That's the best thing you can do.
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:12.860]  Yeah.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.180]  Nobody's going to do it for you.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.260]  This is the real world.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.380]  It's just the way it is.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.700]  It sucks, but it'll make you better.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.180]  And you know, this is the way
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.220]  none of us learned the easy way.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.740]  You know, no one held our hand through it
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.580]  or anything like that.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.020]  Truth, not at all.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.140]  You know, this is the way you have to do it.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.460]  And then from there, you know,
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.620]  just we're looking for people that are, you know,
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.660]  headstrong, that are internet,
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.060]  slightly internet savvy, you know,
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.940]  that can type a complete sentence.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.780]  That's right.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.980]  If you can't type a complete sentence,
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.900]  you're automatically disqualified.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.780]  You know, if you say bay, you're disqualified.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.780]  I'll agree with that.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.740]  Yeah.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.980]  At least one or two lights that you can fully dedicate
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.740]  to the seeds that I'm going to send you.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.340]  At least one light for the 10 pack of seeds
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:00.300]  that you're going to get for free.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.420]  I want one light of your space.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.620]  I want you to be able to make a diary
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.500]  of how your grow went.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.420]  How many of the seeds I sent you germinated?
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.660]  How many of them were females?
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.540]  How many were hermaphrodites?
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.780]  How long did it take to see sex?
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.260]  How long did it take you to find the hermaphrodite?
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.380]  How many of those plants were male and female?
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.780]  Out of those females, how many were keepers?
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.420]  How many would you run again?
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.220]  Would you run this strain again?
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.140]  Do you have the ability to get this plant tested for THC,
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:33.140]  CBD, THC, THC-A, THC-V, CBG?
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.620]  Do you have testing capabilities?
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.100]  Do you have terpenes testing abilities?
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.140]  How was the flavor?
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.860]  How was the high?
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.420]  Was it worth a shit at all?
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.940]  How long did it take to flower?
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.580]  We want that kind of notes.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.420]  And then we want you to get a camera.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.820]  If it's your iPhone, that's rad.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:49.940]  If you've got a better camera,
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.580]  we want you to get a good camera.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.820]  And I want pictures at least once a week
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.820]  of each phenotype carefully labeled with the week number,
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.060]  the strain name, and the phenotype number
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.300]  that you have selected for that.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.820]  But we can't stand in the industry
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.500]  is the guy that we give 20 seeds to that pops three seeds
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.140]  and it takes six months to get a report back
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:08.060]  on those three seeds.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.500]  Yeah, I'm trying to, the reason-
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.740]  I cannot stand that more than anything.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.540]  If you're that guy, you suck, guy.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.540]  I'm just gonna go ahead and say that.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.060]  I've been that guy before because our friend,
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.020]  Gage Green Genetics sent me about 7,000 packs of seeds.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:21.860]  I agree, I have.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.220]  And so he's like, have you tested those yet?
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.780]  And I'm like, I only have so many.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.660]  Yeah, which ones?
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.220]  I can only pull over so far.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.420]  Yeah, shout out to Gage.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.740]  Gage really helped myself out in the cannabis industry,
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:32.700]  helping me get where I am.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.060]  So shout out to Gage Green.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.580]  So let's tell them why it's so frustrating.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.020]  When I send you testers,
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.700]  it's because I am trying to release a new product line
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.580]  and I wanna get research done on that
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.580]  so that I don't put out seeds that are shit
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.780]  because I don't wanna put them available
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.300]  at thedankteam.com and then you spend money on them
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.620]  and then they totally suck.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.660]  So I send out to my testing team,
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.500]  I send out quite a large batch of test seeds.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.660]  I've sent out entire first runs of test batches.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.460]  Like this first breeding project,
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.940]  I kept like 250 of them and then sent fucking 1,000 seeds
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.100]  out to other people to run.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.620]  And then if it's worth a shit, I'll make more.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.460]  That's right.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.980]  And I always find you the easiest way
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.500]  to select the best phenotype out of 1,000 seeds
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.380]  is to have a bunch of really good testers.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.220]  Yeah.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.060]  And stay in contact with them,
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.180]  and keep up with them and have them keep up with you.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.900]  And then that way, whenever it comes down to it
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.380]  and you're like, hey, well, here's something
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.620]  that you don't have for doing all that work,
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.980]  give them a little trade off or something,
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.420]  finding it for you.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.860]  You find keepers and things like that.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.980]  You find test results that you don't find other places.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.260]  That's how I know personally,
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.420]  like a lot of Rust-Ease and Cannavatures,
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.700]  that's when things like that were found.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.300]  That's how our blueberry fuel was found.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.420]  Out of over 500 seeds and three years later,
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.420]  it came out of Boston.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.260]  It ended up out of Boston.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.580]  That's my boy, William Boston.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.420]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.900]  I've got a friend who's doing a really good job
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.900]  with Capleton, and I'm waiting for a cut of that.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.980]  And then I've got a friend who can't be mentioned,
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:55.940]  who's got a really good cut of the Blue Healer,
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.300]  which has some little bit of Blue Dream in there.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.140]  Hashtag.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:06:59.980]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.500]  I tried to fix it.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.340]  I tried to fix it.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.180]  You tried to fix it.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.220]  I was trying to fix the Blue Dream.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.060]  I was just trying to fix it.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.020]  I just added terpenes to it that wasn't presently there.
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.940]  It does really well with OG Terps.
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:12.780]  Okay.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:13.620]  That's what we found,
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:16.500]  because it's already got some myrosine present
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.820]  and some other things that you normally
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.660]  don't typically find in sativas,
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.420]  but you can't really taste it in the Blue Dream,
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.020]  so why not give it that extra kick
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.140]  and add terpenes that aren't normally there
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.980]  in different structures in a shorter flowering time.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.900]  Get a Tangy Blue Dream cross at work.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:31.780]  I bet that's amazing.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.620]  That's really good.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.820]  I bet it's got a really nice structure to it.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.420]  Yeah, real nice structure and heavy yields.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.300]  That's what you need.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.420]  That's what you need nowadays.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.900]  It is a great parent.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.380]  That's really where it lies at anymore.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:42.660]  I don't think it has a place
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.300]  on the top shelf market anymore,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.500]  but to us breeders,
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.220]  I still think it's still golden to these days,
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.540]  because it is so stable.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.940]  Yeah, I'll give it that.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:54.220]  You know, that's why it's close to me,
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.180]  just in my heart,
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.660]  just because it's always been a great breeder.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:57.580]  You can hit it with anything.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.060]  You can hit it with raffinitic genes
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.180]  and it's going to come out great.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.420]  I've done it and had happy accidents and great ideas.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:05.740]  Don't encourage anybody.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.660]  No, no, don't do that on purpose.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.780]  Definitely don't do that on purpose.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.620]  I'm going to back up
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.820]  and something we didn't talk about.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.780]  If you're making feminized seeds,
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.740]  you need to get that male going way early,
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.700]  three weeks ahead of time.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.820]  If you're trying to get your female plants
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.700]  ready to flower at week three,
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.060]  you want to get those males,
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:27.180]  if you want to start spraying them in veg,
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.420]  spray them in veg for a week
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.420]  and then flower them almost six weeks ahead
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.500]  of those girl plants.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.940]  You want to get them a nice fat headstart.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.700]  Reversing a plant takes a lot of time.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.120]  It takes a lot of energy.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.000]  You need to stifle the copper movement in the plant
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.300]  by hitting it with the silver thiosulfate.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.260]  The plant needs to react.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.220]  It needs to learn what to do with that reaction.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.660]  It needs to change its hormones to create pollen.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.700]  Then it needs to develop the sacks to create pollen.
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.900]  Then it will release pollen.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.620]  It's going to take a long time.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.840]  If you're making your first reversed male,
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.780]  you're going to be like, I did it wrong.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:05.460]  You just got to spray it more and more and more and more.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.100]  Don't even waste time with colloidal silver.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.740]  Make your own silver thiosulfate.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.580]  That was really good.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.540]  Spray the shit out of it.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.260]  Since all these new growers are coming on the scene,
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.340]  people are trying to create their new strains and stuff.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.900]  The colloidal silver hype is coming back
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.900]  stronger than ever.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.280]  It was around about 10 years ago
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.980]  and now it's back like bell bottoms, man.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:20.820]  It's crazy.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:23.460]  I'm just like, no, the colloidal silver, don't do it.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.260]  It doesn't block the gene well enough
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.740]  and for long enough and hard enough, strong enough
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.740]  to not create a high ratio of hermaphroditic problems.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.580]  Don't do it.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.580]  Use SDS.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.420]  It's proper.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.780]  In the long run, it's cheaper.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.620]  It's cheaper.
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.560]  Oh, it's so much cheaper.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.660]  I have to throw it away
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.620]  because I make too large of a batch at one time.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.940]  I had to throw tons of it away.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.020]  And it's dirt cheap.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.540]  Once you buy your first batch,
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.500]  I've got some from two years ago.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.340]  That's it.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.140]  That's where I'm at.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.140]  I think you buy a one ounce and a three ounce jar
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.420]  and I think you use like three grams and two grams
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.900]  out of each jar for your first mix.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.020]  My jar is this big.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:57.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.300]  It's huge.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.980]  And you can store that jar for, I've got like 40, 50 bucks.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.060]  Like we said earlier, it's in the fridge right next door
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.580]  to the pollen that we store.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.420]  It's right in there.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.620]  It doesn't degrade in there
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.300]  as long as moisture doesn't get into it.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.300]  If you're gonna make silver thiosulfate spray,
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.980]  one way to keep it around longer,
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.800]  when you mix the two components
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.580]  into these separate containers of water,
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.480]  keep them separate.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.540]  Don't mix them and they'll store longer.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.420]  Right.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.820]  And I also never spray my SDS under light.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.640]  Right.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.900]  I always take it out, spray it in darkness
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.140]  until it's just dripping off.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.220]  I try to get the undersides of the leaves, the stalks.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.580]  The stalks are important.
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.060]  Yeah, spray the stalks.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:33.900]  Yeah.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.900]  And then let it dry out really good.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.380]  Maybe even with a little fan beside it,
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.280]  let it dry out real good.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.300]  Make sure everything's dry.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.380]  Otherwise you will get burn marks.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.220]  And then-
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.380]  And if you put it back in a room with some girls
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.420]  that you're not trying to flip,
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.540]  you'll have some trannies in there.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.380]  That's right.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.420]  Yeah, you'll make some Caitlyn Jenner OG on accident.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.380]  Because a little bit of rub here, a little bit of rub there,
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.220]  a little SDS here, a little SDS there.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.580]  It happens.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.580]  You learn from experience.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.420]  You learn from doing it the wrong way.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.780]  Some plants are gonna take a whole bunch of spray.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:58.740]  Some are not.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.580]  That's it.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.540]  And then some are gonna burn from it.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.420]  And it's okay.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.100]  If the leaves curl up and look pissed off,
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.820]  as long as you still have enough of that plant
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.700]  to create pollen, you're gonna be all right.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.820]  It's that male plant is gonna look like shit
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.780]  after that silver thiosulfate spray.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.220]  And that's what people really need to understand too
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.260]  about reversing plants.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.260]  You're not, I've had somebody come into my grow
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.420]  and say, oh, you have a Hermes plant.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.500]  And I was like, no, it's a reverse plant.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.780]  They look at me and go, huh?
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.860]  And they just look at me, you know,
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.620]  with the most baffled look on their face
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.860]  and they don't understand what I'm talking about.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.060]  Reverse plant is totally different
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.100]  than a hermaphroditic plant.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:26.220]  Yeah, we did this on purpose.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.380]  We did this on purpose and we're blocking genes.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.900]  We're actually blocking genes in the genome.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.220]  Whereas hermaphroditic is like that because of its genome.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.660]  So the silver hits the plant and it can't move by itself.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.580]  So the thiosulfate solution makes it mobile
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:40.780]  and absorbable within the plant.
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:43.220]  And that blocks the copper production in the plant,
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.980]  the copper movement in the plant,
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.740]  which triggers an ethylene response.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.980]  Is it ethyl or ethylene?
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.940]  Fuck, either way, come on, help me out.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.220]  It triggers a response of ethyl or ethylene.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.780]  I'm gonna say ethyl because ethylene sounds
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.620]  like more of a gas, like I'm making meth, right?
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.980]  It sounds like methylamine.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.180]  You're thinking ethanol.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:05.260]  Okay, well, either way, it messes up,
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.820]  it triggers that hormone and that hormone
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.260]  is what tells the plant that it wants to change sexes
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.340]  and start producing pollens.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.420]  Then you make pollen.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.900]  That since this plant has no male chromosomes,
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.060]  it will not donate any male chromosomes
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.020]  to the breeding project.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:18.900]  It'll all be female chromosomes.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.820]  So basically it's taking back the process
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.140]  of traits to its mother.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:22.980]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.340]  That's the mother of the plant.
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.140]  That's pretty much what it is.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.420]  So if you have a 50-50 hybrid,
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.900]  that's what you can expect it to lean
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.340]  toward that mother side.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:35.660]  And then it's ideal once you find the keeper,
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.620]  and I didn't realize not a lot of people
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.900]  were doing this when I started breeding.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.420]  I was reversing a female to a male
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.900]  and hitting several females.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.660]  So I was making nine or 10 feminized crosses at one time.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.260]  And then I realized later that that's not industry standard
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.620]  of how that's done.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.620]  Most of the time people will take a clone only
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.380]  or their favorite plant and reverse that
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.900]  and hit that pollen on a bunch of the same clones
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.540]  and just keep doing it.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.260]  I've actually been reversing plants
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:05.540]  and true breeding with those reversed plants.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:08.020]  And I didn't even realize how far out
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.740]  of the norm I was stepping.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.460]  Most folks would find a keeper
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.860]  and then keep reversing that one
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.140]  to keep making more and more and more.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:18.220]  But I've actually, I reversed a plant,
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.500]  pollinated another plant of the clone of the same strain,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.820]  made seedlings of that, took seeds of that,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.300]  took that original plant I reversed
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.860]  and hit the pollen on that one.
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:30.380]  And after a few finial generations of inbreeding,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:33.500]  I was unable to reverse the plant with silver thiosulfate.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.660]  I bred it so strong that it's so female,
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.740]  it will not reverse on me.
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.700]  It was a Grateful Dog experiment.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.780]  And I called it GD77 is the one that will not reverse.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.420]  1977 is my favorite year as the Grateful Ted
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:52.100]  is why it got GD77.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.060]  Random breeder shit right there.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.460]  Yeah.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.660]  Yeah, right.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.260]  I have another rant I wanna kind of go on,
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.980]  but I don't know, it might piss people off.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.260]  It frustrates me when hashmakers
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.180]  put two different strains in a tube
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.180]  and run it together and think that they can now call it.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.700]  They call it cross of the.
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:08.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.300]  I'm like, no, that took you seven minutes.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.180]  Like it takes me years to develop something
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.020]  that I get to name.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.620]  You don't get to name it.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.140]  You don't get to name something who expressed
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.900]  because you put Dr. Who and Pineapple Express
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.420]  in a container together.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.380]  I'm half serious, I'm half frustrated, half don't care.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.900]  I think it's misleading to the industry.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.060]  It's misleading to the medical patients.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.340]  Because it's hard for them to know what strain.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.180]  Yeah, no, I'm like.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.020]  You have to ask the bud tender.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:32.860]  I know.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:34.420]  I know that this is Dr. Who
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.900]  and probably Pineapple Express
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:37.020]  because I've been in this long enough,
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.140]  but it's called Who Express.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.780]  A lot of, if you're a medical patient
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.860]  and you're not hip and paying attention on Instagram,
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.340]  you don't know what the fuck that is.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.820]  And maybe Dr. Who is your favorite,
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.220]  but maybe Pineapple Express gives you panic attacks.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:53.020]  That could be OG and Tangy for all you know.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.940]  They can name it whatever they want.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.980]  Could be a handful of Who and the rest Express.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:57.820]  And I understand.
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.900]  You don't know.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:14:59.740]  You just don't know.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.300]  Is it really 50-50 bland?
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.660]  Or they don't even label it.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.340]  Right, and I'm not trying to be a hater on that.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.980]  I just think that that's a little bit misleading.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.820]  I understand that the-
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:08.780]  No, we've come to the point in technology
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.860]  in this cannabis industry
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.300]  where we're supposed to be stepping it up here
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.980]  in Colorado and everything else.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.020]  We're the guys that are,
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.260]  these guys sitting at this table right now,
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.980]  among other growers here in Colorado
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.940]  are the ones that are sitting the forefront
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.780]  for all the other states
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.620]  because they're all looking at this state going,
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.020]  how do we do this?
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.220]  And they're falling in line.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.780]  We're taking the lead.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.860]  That's it, we're taking the lead.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.980]  And that started ever since I've been in Colorado
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.300]  and we're proud to be a part of that.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:38.700]  This particular company will only accept 1,000 gram runs.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.380]  So I understand the need to mix shit
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.340]  because if you've got a pound of this and a pound of this,
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.460]  then you got a 1,000 gram run.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.700]  A lot of shrimp.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.220]  Yeah, a lot of shrimp, exactly.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.980]  And they make a great product.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.100]  I'm not gonna say their name or anything
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.060]  because I kind of just talk shit,
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.100]  but they do make a great product.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.140]  I just find it frustrating
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.540]  and misleading almost to the market.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.060]  Well, no, I mean, you're not really talking to,
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.420]  you're just giving them-
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.260]  That's my rant for today.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.580]  Infective criticism.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.420]  That's all that is.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.260]  I mean, if they can't label it,
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.780]  they should label it as so.
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.340]  I mean, then that makes them that much better.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:10.180]  Exactly.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.060]  No disrespect to the people
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.940]  that are forced to combine batches
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:17.220]  because metric makes you do certain shit.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:22.100]  I get it, but I just wish it didn't have to be that way
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.260]  because as a breeder,
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.660]  I get to take Grateful Dog and Girl Scout cookies
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.340]  and put it together and call it doggy style.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:30.820]  If two people do that to hash,
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:31.820]  I don't feel like, I don't know,
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.740]  they just grabbed two tubes and mixed my trim together
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.500]  and now they just made a new strain.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.700]  And now I can't use the name that they just took
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.540]  because now everyone-
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.380]  Exactly what you mean.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.660]  That's why this one right here, you see,
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:44.260]  I just call it the people that did it blend.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.500]  Nice, that is really cool.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.340]  I like that.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.180]  I like how you labeled that.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.020]  I wish I could say their names out loud right now.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.940]  Probably could, but I don't know.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.140]  Cool folks.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:53.980]  Good people.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.740]  I wish they were still sitting at this table right now.
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:57.940]  All right, so we've gotten to the point
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.140]  where we're pulling seeds out of the bud.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.500]  We're curing buds, that's where we are.
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.660]  I try to keep tabs on where we are.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.380]  I don't even have any notebook paper
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.660]  and I can still do a podcast.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.060]  I'm kind of proud of myself.
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:10.780]  All right, we got to cure them.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.220]  You say that here in Colorado,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.340]  we only got to cure them for like three or four days.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.180]  I agree with that.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.540]  I didn't realize that in the swamp, in the South,
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.780]  that you had fucking soup for air.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.300]  So that makes a lot more sense to me
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.980]  than to people that have argued that they need secure time.
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.740]  My theory was that the seeds finish in the buds,
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.500]  in nature, the seeds would finish in the buds,
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.460]  the buds would kind of dry up and die
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.620]  and they would fall into the ground
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.300]  and they would sit in the ground all winter
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.540]  and that would be their natural cure time,
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.940]  which is part of why I keep my seeds in a cooler
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.820]  because I think that nature would keep them
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.540]  in the snow maybe, depending on where they are,
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.860]  maybe cold rain,
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.740]  and then that's what's also going to germinate them.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.700]  The rains are going to come and germinate them in the spring
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.300]  and then they're going to start popping up.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:52.100]  So I just figured that they would kind of be curing
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.980]  in the plant in nature.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.660]  Yeah, they've actually been domesticated to the point now
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.620]  where there's only like,
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.940]  there's only certain regions of the world,
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.380]  there's like a handful of places in the world
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.060]  that weed actually grows just completely naturally,
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.740]  like actual weed, not hemp,
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.500]  actual cannabis that it grows naturally.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.460]  West Himalayan mountains, places like that.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.500]  I'd love to go up there where I've seen Arjen
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.620]  and his crew go up and smoke some of that out in Africa.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.940]  Yeah, Africa is full of a lot of old,
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.580]  like Malawi and places like that.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.980]  They're just full of old land-raised genetics
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:23.940]  that are falling and dying
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.140]  and the same crops coming over and over and over again
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.460]  every year in the same spot.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.700]  Those are heirloom genetics.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.020]  We're going to keep talking about seeds,
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.820]  but I've got another random note that I want to interrupt
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.080]  because I've got some great people here
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.420]  that are great to have cannabis conversation with.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.260]  Have you guys seen Arjen from Greenhouse Seeds?
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.220]  Arjen and Franco and Simon travel all around the world
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.500]  and they go to these places
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500]  where they're growing land-raised genetics
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.740]  and they check it out and they ask the farmers for seeds
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:50.260]  and the farmers happily will give them a bag of seeds.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.100]  Here's seeds, here you go.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.780]  I've seen those, I've seen quite a few of them.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.500]  Arjen then in return hands them packs
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.300]  of his colored greenhouse seeds
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.820]  because his seeds are rolled in colored coating
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.780]  because then he can tell what strain they are
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.380]  without having them in packaging.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.340]  Yeah, they're rolled in some candy coating
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.420]  that also works as a fertilizer
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.100]  and helps your plants germinate.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:13.020]  So he trades them these oftentimes feminized seeds.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:17.020]  Do you guys feel that he is fucking up
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.860]  the land-raised genetics in these places
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.820]  by adulterating them with his seeds?
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.260]  I guess if they're planting them like right out there
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.420]  with their land-raises and they're cross pollinating
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.020]  and I guess he just said they just keep dying
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.220]  and regrowing and eventually I guess
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.380]  it's going to be a different.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:35.100]  Yeah, it does fuck up the heirloom line,
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.640]  but at the same time,
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.380]  I've seen a lot of those heirloom genetics
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.580]  and stuff like that and nothing to really brag home about.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.700]  They look great on paper,
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.500]  but they look like some straight swag
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.900]  and everything is dry and there's really nothing to them.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.100]  So the hindsight is 50-50, you know,
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.180]  I mean, he's going to bring a better yielding strains
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.060]  to places like Africa and places like that.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.180]  But it was in Jamaica.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.820]  It does, we're actually saw him do this.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.920]  Right, yeah, but like you're saying,
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:03.580]  it does, it's kind of a what cost kind of thing.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.420]  Right.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.260]  It's like, yeah, you're going to give them better genetics
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:10.300]  for their future and their kids and their kids
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.820]  and their kids are going to have better yielding,
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:12.980]  better plants and stuff like that,
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.620]  which is going to yield more profits for them.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.900]  So they're going to be able to yield more food
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.660]  for their families and things like that.
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:20.300]  But at the same time, you know, like you said,
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:21.140]  you're going to come in
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.540]  and you're going to completely disasterize those heirlooms,
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:26.420]  which, you know, that's thousands of generations of people,
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.780]  you know, that have been doing the same thing.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.980]  It's history, but change is inevitable.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:33.220]  All right, I like it.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.420]  I'm torn on the subject.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:37.180]  It is, you have to really kind of look 50-50.
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:38.940]  It's not like you can see it everything
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:39.780]  because life is a carburetor.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.600]  It's going to have good and bad to it.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.440]  Like Will said,
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.580]  someone's going to get in there at some point.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:43.620]  Something at some point,
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.900]  what is I'm sure over the thousands of years,
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.540]  there's been another type of cross
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.900]  that got in there on accident somehow.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.740]  Right, right.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.580]  True.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.420]  It could have been somebody's Mexican weed from Florida
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.220]  or it could be greenhouse seeds, white widow.
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.180]  So I guess greenhouse seeds isn't so bad.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.100]  You know, when he comes out.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:02.580]  All right, we'll give him that much.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.820]  All right, so now the seeds are cured.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.060]  We've got a big ass bag
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:09.380]  or maybe a smaller portion of dried and cured seeds.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:11.380]  How do we store them?
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.020]  Again, you can use dried rice.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.940]  What I like to do is steal silicon packets
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.060]  out of electronics and things and things I get in the mail.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.140]  Oh, so you keep all those?
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.260]  Yeah, those little silicon packs
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.740]  that you get like when you buy a new computer
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.580]  or your phone.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.020]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.420]  You take those, I collect all those.
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.460]  I save them up here in Colorado, it's pretty dry.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.060]  So I just grab them and throw them in the freezer
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.700]  or refrigerator as soon as possible
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.060]  to keep moisture away from them.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:38.900]  All right.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.300]  And that way they prolong the life of them.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.060]  You can kind of tell when they're good and when they're bad.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.140]  And if they're nice and good and clear color, they're good.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.020]  If they turn like a dark or an amber color
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.420]  or a dark brown color, they're no longer useful.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.220]  They've actually pulled moisture and bacteria
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:51.060]  and things out of the air,
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.500]  which gave them that color, they oxidized.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.180]  So they're no longer good.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.380]  That's one good way to find out,
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.980]  when you crack it open, take a look.
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.300]  I always crack them open, put them all in a big jar
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.140]  and actually give them in my seed packages.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.500]  Actually in our vials, we do a layer of beads
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.580]  that we do a layer and then we do a layer of cotton,
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.980]  then the seeds and the cotton, then the beads.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.820]  That way it's like a 30 year storage vial.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.660]  Nice.
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.260]  You can throw that in the refrigerator for 30 years
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.020]  and pull it out, pop those seeds.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.140]  That's impressive.
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:19.100]  Yeah, it's simple.
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.780]  Now I have to up my game.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:21.900]  Simple but effective.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.940]  Cause we got the mylar packaging,
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.260]  which in itself is a food saving package.
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.700]  And then we have the vial inside
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.180]  and then we use those beads.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.780]  A lot of the time, growers will get them.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.620]  If you don't get them,
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.980]  that's because we didn't have any to get right at the moment.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.820]  But either way, you still get the cotton
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.540]  and the vial and everything else like that.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.420]  But typically we always put beads in there with them.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.780]  And people have asked me, what's that for?
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.900]  Testers have asked me, what are these beads for?
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.100]  You know, are the seeds in there?
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.820]  I've had one guy ask me, are the seeds in there?
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.580]  Cause he couldn't see them in the cotton.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.620]  He couldn't see them in the cotton
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.900]  and there was just these little silicone beads in there.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.460]  And you know, it also kind of throws them off
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.300]  if you're looking for them in the mail and things like that.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.140]  That's helpful.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:59.460]  But yeah, in a refrigerator store, not freezer,
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:01.140]  I would say you don't want a freezer
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.900]  because once you get below freezing point,
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.700]  you're basically, the water inside of the embryo
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.460]  is trying to expand.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.660]  Right, you'll have more cracked seeds.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.940]  That's basically, you're basically creating
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.020]  a large earthquake inside of your embryo
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.460]  because it's trying to expand and crack outwards
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:17.940]  and it has nowhere else to go.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.460]  It's isolated in that shell.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.660]  So all the water in there is going to crack and expand
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.060]  that embryo and destroy it.
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.220]  So you really want to stay anything above
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.900]  freezing temperature, 32 degrees, bro.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.940]  All right, but now here's my favorite part.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.340]  Once you've got a whole bunch of seeds,
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.380]  you've got your herbs separated, do something with that herb.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.700]  We're going to move on to talk about seeds.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.220]  My favorite part, grow a bunch of the things.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.060]  That's right.
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.940]  Get as many as you can and figure out
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:43.500]  how much space you've got and then grow,
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.220]  plant more seeds than that.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.060]  Because you're going to have-
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.620]  Even if you're not a large scale breeder
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.340]  and you have 500 seeds, you know,
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.540]  give them to your friends, get your own testing.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.940]  You know, that's the way to do it.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.100]  Give them to guys like me, give them to guys like Will.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:55.940]  That's right.
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:57.020]  Rob will take some, we'll grow them.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:57.860]  We're not afraid.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:59.220]  You might have some amazing shit.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.060]  That's right.
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.260]  We'll grow 10 of them for you.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.180]  I got some in from California called Silver Widow
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.860]  and it's a super silver haze, white widow cross.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:09.500]  Oh, that's going to take 112 days to finish.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.900]  Yeah.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.140]  Some of the pictures look great.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:14.780]  And you know, there's some good phenotypes.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:16.420]  I know that are there, they're there.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.460]  You have to find them, but-
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:18.540]  Oh yeah, it's a search.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.740]  Yeah, it's a search.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.340]  You know, you just, and if there's nothing there,
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.820]  then we throw them in the trash can.
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:23.780]  That's just how it works.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.860]  Afterwards we smoke it and blast it, whatever we do.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:30.260]  And you know, it goes on to the next project.
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.180]  You know, you got to have a passion for doing what you do.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.820]  And that's a lot of it too.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.300]  And that's another thing we're looking for at Chester's.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.700]  That's just passion.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:38.540]  Passion.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.380]  That's one of the main things.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.860]  How many people are dedicated to what they do
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.380]  just because they do it anyway?
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.300]  What percentage of your breeding project
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.420]  gets totally scrapped?
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.860]  So you breed, you make seeds,
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:47.900]  you take a few of those seeds,
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.740]  you grow out so many of them, and then you go, ugh.
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.100]  How many times have you just completely flushed a bag
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:53.980]  of seeds down the toilet
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.780]  because the project wasn't worth a shit?
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.340]  I'd say at least 30, 40% of the time.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.020]  That's a good breeder right there.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:00.860]  I'd say literally.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.500]  I just actually went through my box like two weeks ago, man,
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.420]  and just threw away like handfuls and handfuls of stuff.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.260]  Yep.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.300]  A lot of stuff from Michigan,
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.980]  a lot of stuff I did back in Florida,
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.740]  a lot of the old stuff I had, just tossing it.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.980]  As a breeder, it's important
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.380]  that you don't get your ego stuck on a strain.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.220]  You might really think that this cross you've got
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.380]  and this male you've got
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.940]  is going to make the next fucking hype.
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.260]  And if it doesn't, don't be afraid to throw it away.
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:26.100]  Go ahead and toss it.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.500]  We don't want those shitty seeds out on the market.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.460]  You can breed again, you can make something way better,
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.820]  and then you're not going to be known as that guy
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.620]  that made that hermaphroditic weak shit.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.860]  You might be that guy that made that next flame.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:37.940]  You never know.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:38.780]  And we want to know.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.500]  We want to know if you've got problems with the seeds.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.260]  We want to know if you do a great garden
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.260]  and you're automatically having hermaphroditic problems
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.100]  and things like that.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.940]  We want to know these things.
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:47.780]  That's a lot of it.
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.700]  Some breeders don't want to know,
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.700]  and some breeders are too big to give a shit.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.820]  But we're not those guys.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.380]  I know that for a fact.
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:57.020]  We're always down to answer questions,
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:58.940]  and that's why we're here right now.
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:25:59.780]  Yeah.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.620]  Well, thanks for coming for a few, man.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.440]  I appreciate it.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.280]  What else do you think we should cover?
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.580]  We got all the way down to growing them,
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.420]  giving them back to your friends.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.540]  That's what we got from start to finish.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.380]  Yeah, grow them.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.200]  That's the next step.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.040]  That's it.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:08.880]  That's the last thing you can do is grow them.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.700]  Take careful notes, find the keepers,
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:10.700]  give them to your friends to grow.
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.620]  Phenohunt.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.500]  Then make F2s, because F2 is where shit gets really fun.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.340]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.300]  Then you get recessive segregation.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.140]  That's right.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:19.960]  Transgressive segregation.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.800]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.620]  Transgressive segregation.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.140]  It'll show better traits than its parents.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:26.460]  It'll outperform each parent.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.500]  So yeah, you'll see some cool shit happening there.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.580]  Don't believe in too much hype that you hear on things.
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:31.540]  You need to try it for yourself
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.000]  and make your own determination.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:33.840]  True.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.680]  Yeah, don't be afraid to get in there
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.500]  and grow some stuff.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.140]  I've had F6 lavenders from someone.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.540]  Every one of them was Hermie.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.540]  Ooh, wow.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:44.460]  I mean, so, you know, you really-
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.740]  Would you attribute that to the way
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.740]  that he makes his pollen sometimes?
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:51.820]  He does, and then he also does a lot of rottalization.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:52.900]  I know that for a fact.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.180]  He's written articles on it.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.300]  I've read from him that he's done a lot of rottalization,
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.420]  which is basically taking a plant past its harvest point
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.660]  to the point where it's creating a female banana,
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.340]  then harvesting a female banana,
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.140]  which basically is a hermaphroditic banana.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.580]  Yep.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.940]  And he also will light a fire
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.280]  and almost put the plant on fire.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.500]  So it goes into a panic mode,
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.420]  and that panic mode makes it do the same thing.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:17.380]  It makes it spit out herb flowers, which have herb pollen.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:18.540]  Can also do it light stress.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.620]  So he does a lot of old school funky shit that-
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.140]  And shout out to Soma.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.060]  He's done a lot of great things.
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:25.900]  No, no, yeah.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.380]  Some of his strains are some of the greatest ones,
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:28.620]  and still to this day, like lavender,
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:30.300]  I mentioned that's a legendary strain,
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.300]  and when you get good phenotypes out of them,
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.140]  they taste amazing.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.140]  That's so good.
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:37.340]  Man, some of the best concentrates that lavender is,
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.340]  on point, you know,
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.460]  but there's a lot of these old school strains.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.820]  And Soma was one of the guys, if it wasn't for him,
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.980]  the New York City diesel really wouldn't be as hot
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:46.180]  today as it is.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.980]  I really liked his-
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.900]  Oh man, the G13 Hayes.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.420]  There's a G13 Hayes that I picked up a while back
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.100]  from Soma that was amazing.
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.740]  I loved the flavor of that shit.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.260]  Some of his stuff is still hit and miss,
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.740]  but when you find the good keepers, they're keepers.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:02.420]  They're keepers, but you got to run a lot of his gear
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.260]  to find those keepers.
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.500]  It reminds me of like DJ Shorts the same way.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.060]  And that's not to get to DJ, but hey, you know,
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.660]  quit breeding girl weed.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:15.660]  But DJ breeds specifically for what he wants.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.580]  He doesn't give a shit about the market.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.740]  He's a sativa lover.
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.580]  That's it.
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.140]  He's a sativa lover and that's what he breeds.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.140]  And that's his thing, you know,
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.300]  but he has to understand, you know,
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.820]  there's, he does pay for a lot of his advertising.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.740]  He gets great advertising, let me tell you that dude.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.540]  And he's got some bad-ass advertising guys.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:30.460]  I like his book.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.580]  His book is definitely good.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:33.540]  He's a great breeder.
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.220]  He's a great grower and things like that.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.380]  Just not my forte.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.540]  And you know, it's the same thing with him.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.980]  You have to run a hundred seeds to get a good phenotype.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:43.580]  You know, whereas I can generally say,
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:47.740]  I know you gauge me and a venture quite a few others
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.580]  in this game.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:52.220]  I've had 10 packs and found three keepers out of heat.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.220]  Rare dankness.
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.340]  Rare dankness, those keepers, you know.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.860]  I've gotten some really wonky plants from rare dankness.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.700]  I was gonna say,
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:02.020]  in the same 10 pack I've gotten something
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:02.940]  that would make it up,
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.980]  make up for all of the shit they've ever sold me.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.820]  Right.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:07.340]  Like, oh yeah, there's one right there.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:08.180]  Right.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.020]  Yeah.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:09.860]  That's how it was with us with Rugburn.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.420]  We ran up through a bunch of Rugburn seeds
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.380]  and every one of them was like,
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:14.220]  we got an eighth piece off of them.
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.820]  I was just like,
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:18.500]  this is the lankiest wonkiest looking.
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.340]  It smelled good.
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:21.020]  It looked good.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.660]  You know, but it's just like, wow.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:23.500]  You know.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.620]  I don't think Gage gets enough credit in the game.
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:29.260]  Like, more people need to notice Gage Green Genetics.
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.900]  That's definitely a high-end breeding company
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.380]  that gets overlooked in my opinion.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.220]  I do.
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.060]  They're great breeders.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.420]  I mean, they got good material they're working with.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:37.260]  That's a lot of it.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.100]  It's just the material they have is golden.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:41.300]  Joseph Ochi is amazing.
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.140]  It is.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:42.980]  You can't deny it.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:43.820]  I mean, you cannot deny it.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:44.860]  The thing made Grape Stomper
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.580]  and so many other great plants.
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:49.820]  And the Joseph Ocean Beach Cross was one of the,
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:52.780]  one of the highly sought after,
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.620]  but very quick and gone plants, you know,
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:57.420]  that was coming gone so fast
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:59.700]  because it went out basically as testers and never came back.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.340]  I may still have a pack of testers from that.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.260]  OB Rippers.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.460]  Yeah, I might have some of those.
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.300]  Some OB Rippers in us.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.140]  Maybe.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.900]  I've got, honestly, I have a small manila envelope
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.820]  filled with Gage Green Genetics tester packs
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.660]  because he just used to send me so much.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.980]  And he'd be like, run what you can.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:14.820]  Right.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:15.660]  Yeah.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.500]  Yeah, we took the dominant oceans out of that one,
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500]  out of those and I actually bred with them too.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.380]  We got a new one coming out with that pre-98 Bubba,
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.620]  also the OB Ripper.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.460]  Yeah.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.300]  I'd like to,
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.140]  I'd like a close.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:29.180]  Joseph is just too stringy and I hate the way he does that.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.340]  So we're going to hit him with that,
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:32.980]  we hit that pre-90, I call it Babe Heine.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.820]  But, uh.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.300]  My prize mail is an Arise mail,
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.180]  which was started with a Daybreaker mail from Gage.
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.020]  There you go.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:39.860]  Yeah.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.380]  I'm not, I'm not sad to admit that.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.780]  I've done dabs with them.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.820]  No, those are good kids.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:44.660]  They are, they are.
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:45.820]  And you know, we talked about it
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.380]  and you go to them with a 10 pack and be like,
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.380]  hey, I got the Holy Grail.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.420]  I'd be mine if I breed it.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.020]  They're going to look at you and key player Mike
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.020]  is going to tell you, go for it.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:52.860]  They'll help you name it.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.700]  That's it.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.540]  I can tell you, go for it.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:55.900]  Yeah, I've got this, you got any names?
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.380]  You got to have respect for that, you know?
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:58.220]  Yeah.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.540]  I kind of use anything that I breed to the Daybreaker.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.860]  I try to use, I don't copy Gage,
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.100]  but I use their scheme in the names,
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.660]  like Arise and Cascade.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:10.300]  Those were all crosses that came from a Gage male.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:13.020]  So, yeah, just try to honor them in the cross.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.340]  Yeah, you got to give a little bit of props
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.540]  to where it came from.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:17.580]  Respect to the elders.
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.060]  So we did the Bay pine, you know,
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.300]  we put it in there, just the Bay pine.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.780]  California pine trees, you know, and it's where it's from.
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:26.260]  So, let's get a little homage back to Callie.
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:27.100]  Yeah.
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.580]  Got to give love to everybody that does it.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.300]  All right, you guys, we've been going for like an hour.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:32.100]  We need to start wrapping up this part of the show.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.220]  Will, you were a little bit quiet,
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.580]  but we talked a lot about seed breeding.
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:35.980]  Yeah, I was here to learn.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.140]  You guys took me to school.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:38.500]  I hope you learned a whole bunch.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.340]  I definitely did.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.220]  You grew some Kalonji Kush from my seeds
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:42.980]  and that shit looked amazing.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.820]  I actually still have a mother from that cut.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.340]  And I just am actually about to take a bunch of cuts
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.180]  this week.
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.860]  Yeah, I would definitely take one.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.620]  I think it's better than the cut that I've got.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.820]  I remember you saying that a while back.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.780]  Yeah, it's better than the cut.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.260]  We've got the cut at Green and Healthy
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.620]  and your cut looks better.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.500]  It's like covered in trikes.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.940]  One of my favorites to grow too.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:05.500]  It often gets confused for La Plata Labs' Durango OG.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.740]  It looks very similar.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.300]  The smell on the Kalonji was,
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.540]  it was something I had never,
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.020]  I had never smelled weed like that before.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.060]  Everyone I showed it to was like,
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.380]  what the hell, this is crazy.
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:15.220]  Nice.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.060]  So definitely stoked on that one.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:16.900]  Good find.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:17.740]  Oh yeah.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:18.580]  Good phenohunt.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:19.420]  Oh yeah.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:20.260]  Cool.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.100]  Man, where can people find you on social media?
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:22.180]  You can find me on Instagram.
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.940]  It's the, let me see if I'm underscored.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:26.500]  Okay, I think it's the Barefoot Grower.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:27.340]  I think it's Barefoot.
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.780]  Yeah, the underscore Barefoot underscore grower.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.620]  Okay.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.460]  That's me on Instagram.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:32.580]  It's really all I got going on.
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:33.420]  All right.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.500]  You got pictures of the new grow at work up there?
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.860]  Work over at Ascend Cannabis Company.
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:39.020]  You can find them on Instagram too.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:42.420]  It's just at Ascend Cannabis Company, A-S-C-E-N-D.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.700]  Oh man, that might be a new string name, Ascend.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.540]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.380]  I like that.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.420]  I was thinking about that the other day.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.260]  It's messed up.
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:49.100]  That is messed up.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:49.940]  You can have it, bro.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:50.780]  It's yours.
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:51.620]  Go for it.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.940]  No, obviously what made me think about it was Arise.
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:54.780]  That's nice.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.940]  I swear, straight up, dude.
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.820]  I was like, that's a good name for a thing.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:58.980]  Because I go into Canisura a lot
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:00.340]  and they run your Arise in there.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.180]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.420]  Yeah, they actually, they actually.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.260]  Really cool.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.380]  Arise on the show.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.220]  That's awesome.
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.260]  It's one of the favorites of the bud tenders in there.
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.340]  Oh, shit.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.380]  Well, shout out to the Canisura, I guess.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.660]  I'm gonna have to stop in there and buy an eighth
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:13.500]  just to see what it's like.
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.860]  Well, you know, the only reason why I ever go
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.580]  into that place is because they're like the only place
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.780]  in Pueblo West that doesn't just rape you.
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:20.700]  You know, I can go in and get 125 ounces
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.020]  if I'm out between harvest.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:26.180]  You know, and it's, the weed's crap, but you know.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.020]  I was not gonna ask.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:28.860]  Step it up.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.700]  I wasn't gonna ask.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.540]  Step it up, guys.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:31.740]  I was just gonna let you have that one.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.780]  It's fine, I'm just gonna say it.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:33.620]  The weed's crap.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.260]  Quit using machines.
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:36.860]  Oh man, trim machines suck.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.420]  Hire people, employ humans.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:40.540]  That's it, come on, support your community.
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.100]  Stop cutting it early.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:43.260]  Quit doing machine work.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.020]  That's a lot of what the problem is.
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.420]  Once they do that, they got a fantastic looking grow.
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:48.940]  It's clean, it's nice.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.420]  You know, it looks good.
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.740]  They overfeed a little bit.
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:52.980]  You know, when your plants look like they're tying
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:55.180]  their shoes, it's time to back off a little bit.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.780]  Speaking of trimming weed, I owe a shout out
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.060]  to my buddy John Randles Jr.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.700]  That dude trims for 40 hours a week with no complaints.
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.900]  Puts his head down and fucking cuts up weed.
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:06.940]  Good job, brother, thank you.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.860]  I appreciate having you on the team.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:10.740]  Keep it up, do your thing.
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.260]  Will, did we cover all of your social media?
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:15.380]  Yes, the underscore barefoot underscore grower.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.620]  Make sure you support my friend Will.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:17.460]  Check out his pictures.
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:19.180]  He's got some cool shit up there.
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.020]  I think so too, thank you.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:20.900]  Yeah, for sure, man.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.540]  I appreciate your big ass grow.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.420]  Oh yeah, man, I love it over there.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.300]  He posts some cool shit on.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.580]  Do you want these people to follow you on Snapchat also?
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.420]  Sure, yeah.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.340]  I think, let's see what Snapchat is.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:33.020]  I think it's illzweezy on Snapchat.
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.620]  Let's see here.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.780]  Yeah, Snapchat's picky.
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:38.500]  You can find me as the barefoot grower on Snapchat
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:39.860]  or illzweezy on Snapchat.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:41.300]  They're both my usernames.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.140]  I guess you got two, I don't know.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:43.500]  You can see his morning dabs.
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.780]  Yeah, I stay on Snapchat during the day
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.180]  where I post a lot of what we got going on over there.
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.020]  We do a lot every day.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.740]  So if you're interested in what goes on
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:54.500]  in a huge greenhouse on the daily, definitely hit me up.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.700]  It entertains me, so it will definitely entertain
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.220]  the average grower, check it out.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:01.660]  Rob, how can people find you on the social media?
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.820]  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:06.060]  That's pretty much where we're at right now.
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.580]  You guys, the Sour Seed Company?
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:08.900]  All right. Sour Seed Co.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:09.740]  All right.
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.580]  That's it.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.420]  You have a website yet?
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.780]  We had one, I took it down for a little while.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:13.700]  I'm gonna redo everything.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.740]  I'm just gonna redo everything from scratch again.
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.340]  And no more forum.
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.660]  We're just gonna go all out.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:20.420]  The forum gets to be a pain in the ass, doesn't it?
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.500]  It does, it does.
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.500]  And then you have a lot of spam.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:24.340]  That's what I have.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.780]  And the main thing is the money.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:27.940]  To get a good host that doesn't have a lot of spam
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:30.780]  and security and everything else, it costs you a fortune.
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.540]  Yeah, Chinese and Russian hackers trying to get
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.220]  into my forum every single day.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:35.260]  Wanna sell you those Ray-Bans.
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.540]  That's right.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.900]  They join the forum and then they just go
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.180]  and they type in, in the forum,
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:42.620]  they figure out how to put in script in their forum post
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.060]  that can corrupt my website.
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.420]  And then they start stealing shit out of my website.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.900]  And then redirecting it.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.140]  And yeah, this happened twice now,
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.980]  but we're gonna walk down pretty well now.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.980]  I think I feel like I just taunted people,
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.460]  but please don't fuck up my website.
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.100]  We had a great moderator, but it was a lot on him too.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:00.260]  You know, it was like taking up half of his day
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.420]  just trying to get rid of stuff.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.380]  Yeah, I'm the moderator.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.740]  I get the email that says a hacker
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.060]  was registered to your forum
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.180]  and I have to go delete their account, block them.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:10.820]  Shout out to Vinny for doing all that work on our forum.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.660]  But yeah, we shut it down.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.660]  We're doing a website now
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.860]  and we do have a website for the hat pins.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.660]  710hatpins.com.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.500]  Check those guys out.
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.940]  He just brought me two dope ass hat pins.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.260]  I got the little, the zombie pin doll
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.460]  and I got the new Sour Seed Co. logo for my hat.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.300]  That's gonna look fresh.
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.260]  I know where they're gonna go.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.100]  That's look awesome.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:27.940]  Yeah, check us out.
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:29.260]  We do 12.99 free shipping.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.100]  We don't discriminate.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:31.300]  All of our hat pins are the same.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.100]  If you have more than three hat pins
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:36.900]  on your hat, purse and or backpack, you are a wook.
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:37.740]  That is the official rule.
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:38.580]  You look official.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.740]  Yes, three pins is the limit.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:41.780]  Three pins.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:43.020]  We can all agree on three pins, right?
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.020]  Everyone looks too solid.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:44.860]  Three is the limit.
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.700]  All right, more than three pins and you're a wook.
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.260]  Three, three, three makes you a wook.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.100]  Two pins, you're all right.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.260]  Three, you are a wook.
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:52.660]  I have like 15 on my backpack right now.
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.940]  But I make hat pins for a living, so I have an excuse.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:56.980]  You've got an excuse.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:59.420]  I got the iReed Genetics pin on everything.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.820]  I got that one in my frame.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:02.260]  That's in my personal collection.
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.100]  Nice.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.580]  That's where most of mine are on, on frame.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.460]  I don't think I have any on my hats actually.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.220]  I just rocked the one on the hat.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:09.140]  That's all I need.
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:10.820]  Good enough, but I am a wook.
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:11.660]  I'll take that.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.500]  Yeah.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.580]  All right, we've been going for a long time.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:15.500]  Make sure you follow my friends
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.340]  on all their social media feeds.

[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.700]  on this long extended episode.
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.720]  Thanks again for listening to a long episode.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.380]  Big shout out to Matty and Spence.
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:12.220]  And until next time,
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:15.780]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:40:55.760]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:00.000]  It's time for episode number 139 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  That's right.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.720]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.720]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.400]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.800]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.880]  I want to thank you once again for joining me.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.280]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:25.120]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.200]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.680]  You guys sitting across the table from me is our good buddy, White Mike.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.680]  How you doing, bro?
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.680]  I'm doing good, man.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:35.680]  How are you?
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.680]  I'm doing great.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.720]  I listened to a podcast I recorded a couple of days ago and you know what I say way too
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.720]  fucking much?
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:40.720]  What?
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:41.720]  Good buddy.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720]  Good buddy.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.720]  Good buddy.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.720]  Yeah.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720]  My good friend.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  I say good.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.560]  I describe my level of friendliness with somebody as good.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.560]  My good buddy.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.960]  That means you've been elevated past just my buddy.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  Promoted.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.200]  Yeah, a little promotion that it's like a gold star next to your name.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.720]  One of the fun things in the intro that I always look for is the order in which the guests
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.240]  are introduced.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.240]  Clockwise, counterclockwise.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.440]  I try to do ladies first, but I smoke a lot of dabs and sometimes I forget normal.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.160]  What are those casualties?
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  Pleasantries?
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.160]  Courtesies?
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.160]  Common courtesies?
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.160]  I forget some of that shit sometimes.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.160]  Some of all of that.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.160]  I just get high and I try.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.640]  I try to do...
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.400]  Sometimes there's a method to my madness.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.760]  Sometimes it just falls in place because I'm high and that's how it went.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.400]  I'm going to try to quit saying good buddy.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.400]  My good buddy.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.400]  That just sounds weird.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.400]  It's...
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.040]  You broke yourself with some of the cussing, so I bet you can do it.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.360]  I've tried.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.360]  I had to.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.560]  I want it to be a listenable podcast.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.800]  Every now and then when I'm listening to a show, I think, I should stop doing that or
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800]  I should slow down.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.960]  And then we get here and start recording and just all of that melts away.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.600]  We just do a hell of a show.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:47.840]  Somebody that I truly respect in the podcasting industry listened to my podcast and he's like,
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.800]  I got to say, I like your show, but you sure do drop a lot of F-bombs.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.120]  And I was like, oh yeah, you're right, sir.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.120]  This is a weed cast.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.200]  You've got the kids in the car.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.720]  Well, you know, that's just, yeah.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:06.600]  I say if you're just curious about the current state of cannabis, that could be anybody.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.640]  That could be some people that are all at church learning about cannabis through Ross
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.120]  DeJeff and the Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.120]  It could be.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.120]  Welcome everybody.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120]  I'm going to turn down the music.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  We're going to get into the show now.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.120]  Sorry.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.800]  I apologize for all of the show intro rambling.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.120]  Big shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120]  You know how it goes.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.200]  If you need new glass, go to Elevate.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.040]  Buy yourself a new rig, get a new dabber, get a new carb cap, buy yourself an e-nail,
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:31.280]  go say hi to the beautiful and lovely ladies and one gentleman over at Elevate Glass in
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.440]  Colorado Springs, 517 South Tejon.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:35.440]  Go park on Moreno.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440]  I think that's the name of the street.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.440]  It's free.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.840]  You don't have to park right there on Tejon and spend money.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:39.840]  Just go park on Moreno.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.840]  There's a lot more spaces.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:43.600]  You don't have to park in front of the restaurants and shit.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.600]  Save yourself some time.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.680]  Get yourself some nice glass.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:47.680]  Great glass.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.000]  There's almost not room for the microphones tonight because Jeff's been shopping.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.640]  I need to clean this one is why this one's out.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.920]  I wanted to put the e-nail on that one is why that one is out.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.760]  Then I like this banger on this one.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.800]  This quartz nail on this Hitman rig is pretty nice.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.080]  I really like the action that I get off of this Elevate Recycler.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.040]  The action is just fresh.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.040]  It perks.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.040]  It percolates.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.040]  You get a big fat rip off of it.
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.960]  Anyway, shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:16.960]  Go check them out.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:17.960]  Tell them Ross and Jeff sent you.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.960]  Give them a high five.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  Give them a hug.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:20.960]  They're great over there.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.320]  Also, a big shout out to my friend CitizenJay at TokRadio.com.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  You can now hear this podcast on TokRadio.com Wednesdays at 1 p.m.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  Also, make sure you listen to all the other shows on TokRadio.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  You guys check them out.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  There's a show that you will enjoy.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  Do it.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.440]  Big high five to my friend Lucy and her show Lucy in the Sky.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.120]  How you been Mike?
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.120]  I'm good man.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.120]  I'm really busy.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.280]  What's the most interesting thing you have smoked since I've seen you last?
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.280]  That sounds crazy.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.280]  Cannabis related.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.560]  What's the most interesting cannabis product?
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  Not just smoked, consumed.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.840]  I asked a really crazy question now that I think about it.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:55.840]  Did you smoke some DMT?
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840]  No.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.680]  What I really mean is what is the most interesting cannabis product you've consumed?
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:03.520]  Anything get your attention cannabis wise since last time I saw you?
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:09.640]  There's some solventless ice wax floating around that is pretty delicious.
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.680]  We got to sample a little of it tonight, but I also got to sample of it.
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.840]  Somebody else got to show that off before you.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.840]  Yeah.
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:18.400]  Shout out to my friend that got to show that off.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.400]  Before today.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.400]  Shout out to Lindsey.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:21.400]  She should be here for the podcast.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.400]  I didn't invite her.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.400]  We're just going to do a little boy show tonight.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.400]  Nothing against you Lindsey.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.920]  Sometimes I just got to have Mike over and do this.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.800]  Sometimes I'll have just Lindsey over and we'll do this.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  Sometimes I'll be here by myself.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:31.800]  It's my podcast.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.280]  It's my podcast and I do what I want to do.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.400]  My favorite aside in a while just happened.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:46.520]  But before the ice wax, it was probably this 60% CBD shatter.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.800]  Well, it's labeled as shatter.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:51.760]  It's at best a pull and snap.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.760]  It's a little hot lately.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.760]  It's been 90 degrees.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.760]  Yeah, it's been about 100 degrees down here.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.760]  It's not entirely a shatter.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:56.760]  Everybody's shatter.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.640]  It's a fucking snap and feel right now.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.400]  But yeah, really, really tasty.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.680]  So Mike's talking about some ice wax.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:08.120]  What he's talking about is some cream.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.720]  This is 120 micron ice wax made from fresh frozen flowers.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.400]  This hash is, I say uh too much, so I got to quit saying good buddy and uh.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.400]  That's something we got to fix.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  I'm going to make a mental note.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  We'll try to quit doing that.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.280]  Sorry guys, I apologize if I've been doing that to you too much.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:26.240]  But this has been made with fresh frozen material.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.640]  They take the fresh frozen material and I don't know the exact process, but when it comes
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.240]  back it's delivered to us in a cooler and we keep it in a cooler and it looks like beach
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:38.400]  sand and if you just take a little of the beach sand and throw it and like heat up the
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.920]  banger and throw it in the banger, you'll get a really good dab.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.640]  But I like to take some and fold it into some parchment paper and I heat up my carb cap just
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.640]  a little bit.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.520]  I'll heat up my carb cap for just for a second and then roll it over it a couple times and
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:52.440]  mash it into like a little patty and make it look like a sheet of shatter or some pressed
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440]  rosin.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.240]  Then I take dabs of it like that and it burns a little better.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.760]  It burns a little more evenly.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.840]  Uh man, it gets me really red.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.520]  Yeah, that uh as you can tell from this intro.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:03.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.080]  We're both really baked.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.120]  Well, Mike more so than I.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.880]  Yeah, all I've uh I don't think I've smoked any VHO today.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.200]  I think all of the smoking I've done has been ice wax.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.600]  As the lady said, your eyes are red as the devil's dick son.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.960]  Whoa, what lady said that?
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.520]  Uh, the angry lady cop and uh pineapple express.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.520]  Oh, okay.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.520]  That makes more sense.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:25.520]  Uh huh.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.520]  Okay.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.520]  That's why I don't remember being there for that.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.520]  Yep.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:29.520]  Like that didn't happen to me.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.520]  Nope.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]  Happened on film.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.520]  Much better.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.520]  All right, let's get it.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.880]  Uh, let's put this podcast of a train wreck onto some uh, on some rails.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.880]  They do like it when we ramble.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.680]  Speaking of people that like it when we ramble.
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.680]  What up Seb?
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680]  Yeah, what up Seb?
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.960]  Also, uh, what up my friend down under?
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.480]  Thanks for all, everything you do Seb.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.480]  Um, yeah, thanks for listening.
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:48.480]  Congratulations buddy.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.480]  Well, that is public knowledge.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.480]  How you put it up on Facebook.
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.480]  Congrats on the little one bro.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.480]  Dude's in Australia.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.480]  We learned about it on Facebook.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.480]  We can say congratulations on the podcast.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.480]  Yeah.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  Congrats brother.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.480]  Congrats.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:59.480]  Uh, what are you going to name the kid?
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.480]  That's what I want to know next.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.480]  Uh, what are some, oh man.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.320]  Dude, don't put, don't put that, start that pressure yet.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.280]  People tweet us really cool cannabis related baby names.
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.680]  Tweet them to me.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.680]  Uh, at GFYH podcast.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.680]  Yeah.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.600]  At GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.600]  I want to know what you think are really cool cannabis related baby names.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.240]  Mary Jane is fucking obvious.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.200]  I was going to say, if you tweet Mary Jane or Sativa or Indica, you're just out.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.160]  Ruderalis would be a dick name right there.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.160]  Well, I don't know.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.440]  Cause imagine Mary Jane in a little Australian accent.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.840]  Why'd you have to go right there?
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  Sorry Seb.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.760]  It would sound really cool.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.320]  I'm not going to be offensive and try to do a shitty Australian accent cause I know it's
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.320]  not going to be good, but it'll, it'll sound really funny.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.560]  And I know, I know Seb's last name, so it would really flow.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.560]  It would work.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.560]  Uh, but you guys tweet me your, your ideas.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.240]  Let's, but anyway, uh, shout out to our friend Fred Garvin.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.240]  Fred, uh, loved the podcast.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.280]  Oh, I got the wrong email on the screen.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.280]  Here we go.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.560]  Fred loved the podcast that we put out recently, uh, about breeding seeds and how to take care
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:04.800]  of his seed harvest.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.160]  He said, there's something that we left out.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.920]  Let me just read what Fred sent me instead of stumbling through this.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.600]  He said, question about the last show.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.520]  You guys mentioned moving seeded females outside and some point in a run.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.960]  I'd like to do that.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.480]  Just wondering the right way to do this.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.680]  I run my lights at 6 PM to 6 AM.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.280]  So what is the best transition time at 6 PM?
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.360]  Let's see at 6 PM when it usually light on or okay.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.480]  Or 6 AM when the lights are off.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.680]  Also here in SoCal, we have about 14 and a half hours of light right now.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:39.560]  So if I do this, should I cut them off at 12 hours with some light depth or to leave
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.760]  them be all my outdoor plants are well into flower.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.760]  All right.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.720]  So he's got some, he's got a process on his hands.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.720]  Yeah.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.880]  He's got some seeded females.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:52.680]  He's got some plants that he, it sounds like he's got some plants that were hit with pollen
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:57.240]  and they're seeded and he wants to take them outside to finish up, but he's been running
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:00.560]  his lights from 6 PM to 6 AM.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.680]  So basically when the sun's going down, his lights are coming on.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:04.680]  Yep.
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:08.720]  And he wants to put these plants outside.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:14.240]  Your goal, he's going to have to baby step his way around the clock, isn't he?
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.640]  And introduce them into the sun slowly maybe also, I don't know how big they are and how
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.040]  hardy they are, but I don't know if putting these plants out into the sunshine, how slowly
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.680]  you need to introduce them.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.000]  So shoot, you got a challenge there.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.840]  I would almost start adjusting your indoor cycle to match the outdoor cycle.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  Yeah.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:38.320]  You don't want to, you can't jump it, can you?
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.040]  You can't do like six hours a day.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:42.480]  You've got to do like half hour on either end, right?
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.880]  I would almost, and this may sound crazy.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.520]  I would almost leave the lights off, just unplug them and tell, and then reset the schedule.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.600]  Leave them off for a good 24 to 36 hours.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  However you have to do that.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.480]  Just handle it like a power outage, huh?
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.480]  Yeah.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:57.480]  Yeah.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.320]  You don't want to interrupt the time because you would rather interrupt a light period
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.320]  than a dark period.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.320]  Right.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:06.320]  Clouds happen, sun at night doesn't.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:12.040]  Well, those clouds don't block out the sun for the plants receiving.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:16.320]  But it did not enough to put the plant to sleep, but you don't want, yeah, you're not
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:20.760]  going to be able to get, yeah, I think your best bet is just to start adjusting your timer
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.640]  to the outside schedule.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:24.760]  I would leave it off for like 36 hours.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.640]  Just unplug it, leave it off for 24 to 36 hours so that those plants get that solid
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:30.040]  12 hours.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:34.160]  And then whenever that next time, like if you're, let's say you're turning off at 6
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.160]  AM.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:38.280]  What kind of stress is that going to do to the plants though?
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.200]  You've been around when the power has gone out here for a while, or I've had, remember
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.840]  a long time ago I had an issue in a grow room and I couldn't get enough power and everything
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.800]  just fucked up and I couldn't get the electrician here for several days.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.800]  I was at the old house.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:49.800]  It was at the old house actually.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:50.800]  Yeah.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:55.320]  And I had an electrician around, so they just stayed off for like 36 hours until the
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.640]  electrician could come on.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.760]  I think it's better to put them in the dark and just let them sleep.
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:04.600]  They're not going to get the sunshine or the light for that day's growth, but they're still
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.680]  going to keep developing.
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:09.480]  He's got them seated, so he's got to hurry up and do this within like a 24 to 36 hour
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.480]  period.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.320]  He's only going to miss one day of that photo period.
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:14.320]  He'll be all right.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.280]  Well, he'll make that photo period of being outside.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.120]  Provided he doesn't kill one transition.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:23.400]  That sun energy is definitely going to make up for that.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.080]  That is a very good point.
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:31.720]  Okay, so the plan so far is to kill the lights for 24 to 36 hours, move the indoor girls
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.640]  onto a light cycle that's in line with the outdoor light cycle that he's currently dealing
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.840]  with and then he's going to run them in and out every day?
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.800]  Or is they just going to go outside full time?
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.160]  Did I just overcomplicate for this question?
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.160]  No, no.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.160]  You're right where you need to be.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.160]  Yeah.
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160]  Flip them.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:52.080]  You're going to need to rest in the dark until you can get the timer to come back on when
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.080]  the sun comes up.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:57.480]  So you're pretty much going to have to, you're going to need 36 hours from your time schedule
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.640]  it sounds like.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:03.160]  So unplug them, wait until the sun, until you can match the time of the sun.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:06.760]  Let them get their solid 12 hours of sleep, then match the time of the sun, plug your
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:12.520]  timer into that and then maybe every day take them out for four or five hours and pay really
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]  good attention to them.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.080]  And just take them out and pay attention.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:18.720]  Maybe if you see them getting fucked up, take them in the house and then do them for a little
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.760]  longer next time, a little longer.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.720]  But maybe if they're big and healthy enough, it's Fred.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.520]  I know Fred, Fred, your plants are healthy, bro.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.720]  You could probably take them out there and put them out there and they'll be cool.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.880]  But keep an eye on them.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.880]  Keep a good eye on them.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:30.880]  Be out there with them.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:33.720]  They call it acclimating and it really does work best in stages.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:34.720]  Yeah.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.720]  Give them two hours for two days and then three hours for two days, that kind of thing.
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:39.720]  Right.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:43.920]  Then his next question, next part of his question, he says that out there in SoCal they have
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.160]  about 14 and a half hours of light right now.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:50.400]  So if he does that, should he cut them off at 12 hours with some light depth or let them
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.400]  be?
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:54.720]  If you can cut them off with light depth, that would be awesome.
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:00.000]  If not, here's an Ed Rosenthal's book, the Oakster Damn Course Guide.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.160]  I don't remember the exact title of the book, but there is a section about near and far
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.880]  red lighting.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:11.560]  And I would have to read it to be completely accurate.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:15.020]  But one of those spectrums happens when the sun sets and rises.
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:21.260]  It happens when the sun sets and that red, it's either near or far red, tells the plant
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.260]  to go to sleep.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:24.060]  That triggers it to go to sleep.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:28.420]  So I think your 14 hours, you may be getting enough sleep time.
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:33.260]  I'm not sure your plants are waking up and going to bed.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:36.060]  I think it's going to work out is what I think I'm trying to say.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:37.260]  I think you'll be all right.
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:39.740]  If you can cover it, do it.
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:41.740]  If it's possible, by all means, just do it.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.140]  Take the extra effort and go for it.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.720]  And then you're certain that it's going to work.
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:50.140]  And if you can't build the outdoor hoop house or whatever you're going to use to cover a
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:54.020]  light depth area, maybe wait just a couple of weeks and you'll be just fine.
[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:57.900]  Well, you'll be well into your outdoor photo period, just a few weeks.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.620]  We're already at that point.
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:02.380]  Jesus, man, time flies when you're having a kid.
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.380]  Time goes, yeah.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:05.660]  Welcome to the club, brother.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.340]  Yesterday, my daughter turned 13.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:11.540]  I'm sitting here thinking like, nah, you just put the people just put their plant.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:13.340]  I saw that happen weeks and weeks ago.
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.340]  Yeah.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.340]  Plants have been outside.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:16.340]  Weeks and weeks ago.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.340]  Yep.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:23.100]  Um, um, so my daughter turned 13 yesterday and spent her birthday at a play in London.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:24.100]  Congrats.
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:25.100]  Yes, yes.
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:26.100]  Well, thank you.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.100]  Thank you.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.100]  Happy birthday, kiddo.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.460]  She does not listen to the show, but all right.
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:32.940]  So Fred, I hope we didn't give you just a whole bunch of crap because we're both high
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:36.020]  and we rambled a lot, but hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.020]  Yep.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.020]  Um, cut the time.
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:39.140]  Kind of, kind of answered his question.
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:42.300]  The Fred's main problem that I foresee is going to be, there's a reason he's running
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.300]  at night.
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:46.660]  Um, and if he's lucky, it's just economics.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:47.980]  They go off at 6 AM.
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:48.980]  So leave them off.
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:51.040]  They would normally come back on at 6 PM.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:52.040]  Don't turn them on.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:55.180]  Then leave them off until the sun comes back up around six, dude.
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.180]  That's what you got to do.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.180]  Figure out when the sun comes up that day.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:05.690]  So they're only going to be off for 24 hours because he's turning them off at 6 AM.
[01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:06.790]  Okay.
[01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:07.790]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:08.790]  Fred,
[01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:14.130]  I was getting at is like people run for, um, for temperature reasons.
[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:15.870]  It's a lot easier to cool your system.
[01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:16.870]  You're right.
[01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:17.870]  Yeah.
[01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:18.870]  At night.
[01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:21.950]  It's a, and, uh, sometimes in some places power's cheaper and some people have day jobs
[01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:25.550]  and have to grow wheat at night, right?
[01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:32.350]  But uh, depending on what Fred's reasons are for going at night, he, uh, um, is definitely
[01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:36.910]  going to have some work to, to figure out some adjusting about a 36 hour window there
[01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:37.910]  to figure it out.
[01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:41.230]  So if you have a timer, uh, get them on the same schedule as the outside.
[01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:44.510]  If you can, I, that's the best I can tell you for that part.
[01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:49.430]  Uh, then start taking them outside slowly or cut them off for 36 hours and then take
[01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:52.430]  them outside if that's what you have to do.
[01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:55.350]  And then if you need to put them in the hoop house to get them dark, do that.
[01:56:55.350 --> 01:57:00.590]  And if not, I think you'll be okay, but I could be wrong to be totally honest.
[01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:07.710]  But I think, uh, about 13, 14 hours, uh, you should be getting enough nighttime photo period
[01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:10.110]  for those plans, but be careful.
[01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:11.110]  All right.
[01:57:11.110 --> 01:57:14.110]  There's a lot of fucking things.
[01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:15.670]  There's so many variables in there.
[01:57:15.670 --> 01:57:16.670]  Yes.
[01:57:16.670 --> 01:57:17.670]  Fred, I hope we answered your question.
[01:57:17.670 --> 01:57:18.670]  I hope we helped you out.
[01:57:18.670 --> 01:57:23.750]  I hope I get a couple of packs of those seeds when you get finished with this project.
[01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:26.310]  Dude, thanks for, uh, Fred, thanks for the support.
[01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:27.310]  Thanks for listening so much.
[01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:29.430]  You've been following me for a long time on social media.
[01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:33.870]  You've been listening to the show since I think you got a prize on episode 50.
[01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:34.870]  That's how long ago that was.
[01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:37.310]  I'm not even sure now that I'm thinking about it was a 50 when we gave away a whole bunch
[01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:38.310]  of stuff.
[01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:39.310]  I can't remember.
[01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:40.310]  I think it was 50.
[01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:41.310]  It was 50 or 100.
[01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:42.310]  No, number 100.
[01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:44.030]  We had everybody here and we just got that.
[01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:45.030]  It was 50.
[01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:46.030]  Yeah.
[01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:47.830]  So it was 50 and I think Fred got a prize in that.
[01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:49.710]  So that's how long Fred's been supporting us.
[01:57:49.710 --> 01:57:50.710]  Thanks a lot, brother.
[01:57:50.710 --> 01:57:51.710]  I appreciate that.
[01:57:51.710 --> 01:57:52.710]  Thanks for interacting.
[01:57:52.710 --> 01:57:56.710]  Um, if you have a followup question to our rambles, please send it to me the same way
[01:57:56.710 --> 01:57:58.510]  that you sent this one and I'll check it out.
[01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:59.510]  Yep.
[01:57:59.510 --> 01:58:00.510]  All right.
[01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:01.990]  I'm going to move on to the next part of the show.
[01:58:02.110 --> 01:58:08.030]  We got an email from a friend who, um, he has a problem.
[01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:09.030]  Let me just read the email.
[01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:10.790]  He says, Hey, Ross, I love the show.
[01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:13.150]  Maybe you can help me recover from a huge mistake.
[01:58:13.150 --> 01:58:17.010]  I think I may have mislabeled two different plants when I was cloning them.
[01:58:17.010 --> 01:58:21.510]  Now I think five are Alaskan Thunderfuck and five are master Kush.
[01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:25.350]  How should I go about making sure I clone and properly label said plants?
[01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:30.430]  Then he says, should I take a clone of each plant and label them mom and clone with a
[01:58:30.430 --> 01:58:35.630]  certain tag and do all 10 or should I make more than one clone of each?
[01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:41.350]  I know after I clone, I need to toss the moms into bloom after I see roots.
[01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:46.790]  So it sounds like this dude, uh, had a mother plant and took clones, took 10 clones and
[01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:49.470]  may have mislabeled those 10 clones.
[01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:55.630]  He's hoping he took five and five and lost all 10 labels is basically what I'm getting.
[01:58:55.630 --> 01:58:56.630]  Right.
[01:58:56.630 --> 01:59:01.630]  So he at least had the, uh, the mother plants out properly and took five and five.
[01:59:01.630 --> 01:59:03.310]  I'm hoping that that went right.
[01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:04.310]  Yeah.
[01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:07.910]  That's the, that's, I didn't even think about that part when I read the question.
[01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:14.670]  The real answer to this is, is proper labeling from the get go and how each grower goes about
[01:59:14.670 --> 01:59:15.990]  that is wildly different.
[01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.990]  Right.
[01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:20.670]  Well, I'll give him my advice and, uh, props for admitting that you may have made a mistake,
[01:59:20.670 --> 01:59:24.870]  but in your pothead mind, you probably did it just fine and you're paranoid, but let's
[01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:29.310]  uh, he asks, first of all, now I think a five or this and five or this, how should
[01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:32.790]  I go about making sure I clone and properly label said plants?
[01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:33.790]  Okay.
[01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:38.430]  Take all 10 of those plants and set them in a straight line of a row and then grab one
[01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:43.750]  plant, the one that's in the front of the row and take that to an area and get some
[01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:49.950]  white duct tape and write a on that one and then cut as many clones as you can cut from
[01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:55.110]  it without killing that plant and label all of those clones very clearly.
[01:59:55.110 --> 01:59:58.910]  However you, if you cut them into a rapid routers, if you cut them into an easy cloner,
[01:59:58.910 --> 02:00:04.670]  label them a and then take that plant that's labeled a and put it somewhere else.
[02:00:04.670 --> 02:00:08.550]  Now go get the next plant that's in that straight line filled with plants and carry it over
[02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:09.990]  to the cloning area.
[02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:14.030]  Get that white duct tape, write a B on there and label that motherfucker B and then take
[02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:18.790]  as many clones as you can get off of plant that is now a number B. Get as many clones
[02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:21.230]  as you can and label them carefully.
[02:00:21.230 --> 02:00:22.630]  B. That's what you got to do.
[02:00:22.630 --> 02:00:25.310]  I think my friend, I think that's what's got to happen.
[02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:27.550]  It's a, it's all in setting it up from the get go.
[02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:32.510]  I used to help a dude clone a hundred, 200 clones at a time from six, eight, 10 different
[02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:38.710]  strains and um, everything got labeled when they're in that obnoxious little pup 10 cloner.
[02:00:38.710 --> 02:00:45.830]  Um, we'd cut little slivers out of a solo cup, um, and use those as little label pegs
[02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:47.470]  to go in next to the plug.
[02:00:47.710 --> 02:00:47.990]  Yeah.
[02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:52.030]  Um, other people use really good little labels.
[02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:53.630]  Those little just plant label sticks.
[02:00:53.670 --> 02:00:56.910]  I just use those and write on those and stick them in the neoprene is how I do it.
[02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:57.110]  Yep.
[02:00:57.150 --> 02:01:01.350]  I've seen ones that look like a, it almost looks like a little flag that you would stick
[02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:05.950]  in like a sandwich or something like a toothpick that stick right in the plugs that make it
[02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:06.550]  real easy.
[02:01:06.590 --> 02:01:07.030]  How cute.
[02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:11.270]  Um, but like keeping your labels good from the get goes the best way here.
[02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:19.230]  Um, as long as you make sure you've got, um, uh, a healthy clone from your mother, when
[02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:22.550]  you flower that out, like you'll be able to tell, Oh, this one's more cushy.
[02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:23.190]  This one's right.
[02:01:23.190 --> 02:01:23.390]  Yeah.
[02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:27.350]  Hopefully within like four or five to six weeks, you'll know which is, and as long as
[02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:33.750]  you go ahead and get your labels right when you clone next, um, you'll know for sure.
[02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:34.310]  Okay.
[02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:39.910]  Um, these clones are definitely from plant a, these clones are definitely from plant
[02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:40.350]  B.
[02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:44.630]  Once you fucking fit or once you finally finish it out, you'll know, okay.
[02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:45.750]  Um, plant a, right.
[02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:46.790]  The Alaskan plan.
[02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:47.670]  What you can do.
[02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:49.430]  So once you're going to take cuts, right.
[02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:51.710]  And you're going to have hopefully three, how much to take three cuts.
[02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:53.710]  I've got OCD that works in groups of threes.
[02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:58.150]  So I take a, take three cuts and then take mother plant, a mother plant, be line them
[02:01:58.150 --> 02:01:58.950]  back up in the grow room.
[02:01:58.950 --> 02:02:00.590]  All pretty let your clones root.
[02:02:00.590 --> 02:02:04.390]  As soon as you see roots on there, uh, put them into their next stage, which is usually
[02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:05.030]  a cup for me.
[02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:07.910]  Some people use a little one gallon pot, whatever you want to do, put it in the next
[02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:10.870]  step and then take that one that you cut the clone from.
[02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:11.590]  It's already grown.
[02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:12.270]  It's already big.
[02:02:12.670 --> 02:02:13.710]  Uh, just go flower that one.
[02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:16.070]  I think that's what the plan called for.
[02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:18.990]  Uh, I think he just wants to make sure he gets his genetics.
[02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:22.190]  Uh, it's the mom's into bloom after I see roots.
[02:02:22.190 --> 02:02:23.350]  So yeah, there you go.
[02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.990]  Exactly, bro.
[02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:25.790]  So I think you figured out what you got to do.
[02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:27.590]  You have to take clones from every one of them.
[02:02:28.150 --> 02:02:31.230]  And then the best part is now you're going to have a bunch of clones to grow next
[02:02:31.230 --> 02:02:31.730]  time.
[02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:32.450]  Right.
[02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:37.030]  Um, if you're, if, if you're not sure at this point, what you're, what you're about
[02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:42.550]  to flower out is, and you're not a hundred percent sure you've got his genetics, um,
[02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:47.550]  preserved in a healthy clone, just go ahead and take another clone and then give it, I
[02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:48.950]  mean, you only have to give it a few days.
[02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:53.430]  If you only take three clones, four clones off of it, unless your mother plant is
[02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:54.070]  really like,
[02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:58.390]  I don't know if he's still got a mother plant, like the original mom that these
[02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:59.910]  five of each clones came from.
[02:02:59.910 --> 02:03:01.430]  I don't know where that is in this story.
[02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:02.990]  So I'm just assuming he doesn't have that.
[02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:06.710]  I'm assuming all he's got are these 10 clones and he's got to figure out what
[02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:07.670]  easily be that way.
[02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:07.830]  Yeah.
[02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:09.470]  Hopefully, hopefully there's five and five.
[02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:11.710]  I watched you clone a nugget.
[02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:12.790]  You were handed once.
[02:03:13.150 --> 02:03:14.950]  Don't tell people all the crazy shit I've done.
[02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:20.030]  Like if you've still got the plant alive, you can, you can preserve the genetics if
[02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.510]  you must.
[02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:25.310]  We were at a garden and somebody was trying to be nice and blessed me by cutting off a
[02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:26.830]  fresh little tiny bottom bud.
[02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:28.630]  And they're like, try that out and check it out.
[02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:31.230]  Cause I wasn't going to see the guy for a while and I wasn't going to get a chance to
[02:03:31.230 --> 02:03:32.670]  taste the medicine when it finished.
[02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:35.190]  And he gave me, it still had leaves on it.
[02:03:35.190 --> 02:03:36.110]  It still was beautiful.
[02:03:36.110 --> 02:03:40.430]  It was fresh off the bud and we're driving and Mike said, you know what you should do
[02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:45.150]  is you should try to clone that because it was a plant that we really wished we had.
[02:03:45.150 --> 02:03:45.390]  Yep.
[02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:46.710]  And it worked.
[02:03:46.750 --> 02:03:47.190]  It worked.
[02:03:47.190 --> 02:03:51.470]  I cloned it and it took a long time to revert that bud back into a usable plant, but I was
[02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:55.430]  able to clone that plant and we had that strain around for, and it was kind of a
[02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:58.750]  fucking mutant of it, but it, the bud was very similar.
[02:03:58.750 --> 02:04:00.630]  The flavor, but it still looked the same.
[02:04:00.630 --> 02:04:00.990]  You know?
[02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:01.470]  Yeah.
[02:04:01.590 --> 02:04:03.830]  But so I did clone a flowered bud.
[02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:05.310]  It took a long time to revert it.
[02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:08.870]  The leaves did a bunch of spirally weird twisty shit, but yeah, I've done some crazy
[02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:09.190]  things.
[02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:12.470]  So dude, what you got to do, I'm going to recap and then we're going to move on.
[02:04:12.670 --> 02:04:13.950]  Take clones from all of them.
[02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:17.590]  As many clones as you can afford to take space wise and without murdering that plant.
[02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:20.950]  Then while you're taking those clones, carefully shape that plant into something
[02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:21.950]  that would flower nicely.
[02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:25.990]  Then carry those to the flower room when you see roots and flower the shit out of
[02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.110]  them.
[02:04:26.190 --> 02:04:27.190]  That's, that's my advice.
[02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.670]  All right.
[02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:29.150]  Uh, dude, thank you for the question.
[02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:30.630]  I hope I helped you out next time.
[02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:33.950]  Label more carefully, but don't be afraid to admit that you make some mistakes.
[02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:35.830]  Please continue to send me emails.
[02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:37.710]  Keep me updated on this, how this goes.
[02:04:37.710 --> 02:04:39.350]  I think you hit me up on Instagram.
[02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:41.710]  It looks like thanks for following me on there.
[02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:42.150]  Guys.
[02:04:42.150 --> 02:04:45.510]  If you want to follow me on Instagram, it's Iree underscore genetics.
[02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:47.310]  I would appreciate that.
[02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:49.030]  All right.
[02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:52.270]  Now today, something cool happened in the state of Colorado.
[02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:53.590]  Something very cool.
[02:04:53.590 --> 02:04:55.470]  Have something very cool happened.
[02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:59.590]  If you don't live here, if you don't want, yeah, if you live here, well, I wrote, I
[02:04:59.590 --> 02:05:02.830]  wrote down a list of pros and I want to see if there's a list of cons that you can come
[02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:04.270]  up with once we talk about this.
[02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:04.550]  Sure.
[02:05:04.990 --> 02:05:12.070]  Um, so today the Colorado MED stated that does it start today?
[02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:14.190]  I was told it started today.
[02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:15.190]  Starting today.
[02:05:15.190 --> 02:05:17.470]  Well, then by the time this recording comes out, it will have already started.
[02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:18.750]  Change this rule.
[02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:21.310]  This rule was changed in the legislature, I believe.
[02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.790]  Okay.
[02:05:22.190 --> 02:05:28.270]  Um, if I'm not mistaken, the, the legislatures wrote it past it.
[02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:31.230]  It was signed by the governor and the MED implemented it today.
[02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:31.990]  Nice.
[02:05:32.150 --> 02:05:32.430]  Okay.
[02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:34.430]  Um, I didn't even think this was going to pass.
[02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:38.070]  It's a really, really, really nice, a nice little gift to the industry.
[02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:41.790]  We've just built up so much suspense that we should tell everybody what happened.
[02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:42.910]  Guess what happened?
[02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:43.550]  Guess what happened?
[02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.790]  You guys.
[02:05:44.190 --> 02:05:45.070]  So it's starting today.
[02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:48.190]  Today is, uh, July, June 16th while we travel.
[02:05:48.190 --> 02:05:49.310]  June 16th.
[02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:50.190]  June 16th.
[02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:51.190]  15th.
[02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:52.310]  June 15th.
[02:05:52.670 --> 02:05:53.750]  Oh, thank Christ.
[02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:54.470]  It's the 16th.
[02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:56.510]  No, it's the, well, it's after midnight is why I'm tripping.
[02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:59.030]  Cause I was going to say, I've got an anniversary like many Ana.
[02:05:59.350 --> 02:06:01.230]  Just about fucked that up.
[02:06:02.670 --> 02:06:03.710]  Happy anniversary, Jen.
[02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.670]  Hope you're listening.
[02:06:05.070 --> 02:06:06.390]  Um, she probably isn't.
[02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:08.190]  Uh, so she's sleeping.
[02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:09.910]  It happened on the 15th.
[02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:11.150]  We're now recording after midnight.
[02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:11.950]  Midnight has passed.
[02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:13.030]  So it started on the 15th.
[02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.990]  We're rambling today, guys.
[02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:15.110]  We blame that on bubble hash.
[02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:21.110]  Um, so as of today, as of today, out of state shoppers in a dispensary before
[02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:25.910]  today, let's rewind before today, out of state shoppers were limited to seven
[02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:28.230]  grams of raw cannabis on their purchase.
[02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:33.910]  Now those same shoppers, folks who are over 21 and have an ID that can prove.
[02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:37.470]  So if they're from out of state, they are able to purchase one ounce of cannabis
[02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:40.750]  product, just like a statey, just like someone that lives here.
[02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:42.470]  You can walk in and buy one out.
[02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.710]  Yeah.
[02:06:42.710 --> 02:06:43.990]  Fuck that native sticker.
[02:06:45.110 --> 02:06:46.150]  Now you're equals.
[02:06:46.190 --> 02:06:47.310]  Now we're all equals.
[02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:51.270]  You can come here and buy just the same amount of marijuana as anybody else.
[02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:51.670]  Yeah.
[02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:52.710]  And you're allowed to possess it.
[02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:54.670]  The only problem is there's still nowhere to smoke it.
[02:06:54.910 --> 02:06:55.110]  Yep.
[02:06:55.110 --> 02:06:55.990]  That's still an issue.
[02:06:56.110 --> 02:06:56.830]  That's the only car.
[02:06:57.430 --> 02:07:02.270]  There was another rule that was, uh, it was passed last, last November.
[02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:05.870]  Um, it was supposed to go in effect in January and they kicked it down the
[02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:11.990]  road till October that was going to restrict, um, out of state folks, uh,
[02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:15.750]  edible wise, and they're going to crank down those limits quite a bit.
[02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:17.470]  But I think all that just went out the window.
[02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:17.950]  Good.
[02:07:18.150 --> 02:07:21.030]  I love it when they talk shit out, you know, it did pass was no more.
[02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:24.750]  No more gummy bears, no more gummy bears, no more edibles, no more cannabis
[02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:26.350]  edibles shaped like gummy bears.
[02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.910]  You can't do that.
[02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:28.430]  It's not just gummy bears.
[02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:32.950]  It's a, no more edible shaped like fruit shapes, animals, people.
[02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:35.110]  There's another one.
[02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:39.430]  I don't remember basically anything that like is currently on the market,
[02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:41.350]  other than squares and triangles.
[02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:44.630]  They just don't want the kids to be encouraged by a great shape.
[02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:49.310]  On the same day, that particular, the edible restriction bill was signed.
[02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:53.230]  The governor signed another bill to put hard liquor in grocery stores.
[02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:53.950]  I saw that.
[02:07:54.230 --> 02:07:58.070]  On the same day, you can buy whiskey and tequila at Walmart.
[02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:59.830]  It's going to be gradual.
[02:07:59.870 --> 02:08:02.390]  So for the next couple of years, it'll just be wine.
[02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:05.790]  Um, you mean I'll be able to buy a gun.
[02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:08.870]  I'll be able to buy a gun and a bottle of whiskey at the right
[02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:12.870]  superstore at the right Walmart, probably the one that did the Pueblo West.
[02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:13.350]  Yeah.
[02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:15.550]  It's a, it's a, it's the right Walmart.
[02:08:15.550 --> 02:08:19.190]  You will be able to get a gun and hard liquor and frozen
[02:08:19.190 --> 02:08:21.830]  pizza and the new X-Box America.
[02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:24.910]  All at once while your oil is getting changed and you're getting your
[02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:30.510]  glasses and doing your banking and taking pictures of sweet mullets.
[02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:33.310]  Hopefully you're searching for mullets while you're at Walmart.
[02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:36.470]  If you can find somebody, all right, guys, challenge, challenge.
[02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:39.670]  I want some, I want a picture of somebody in their pajamas
[02:08:39.670 --> 02:08:41.030]  with a mullet at a Walmart.
[02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:42.750]  I know I want it to be your photo.
[02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:43.910]  Don't fucking internet me.
[02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:44.830]  Don't Google this shit.
[02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:48.910]  Um, an extra small, slightly dirty Irish shirt.
[02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:52.270]  Well, I don't have any shirts I can offer cause they're all at the store.
[02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:53.990]  I don't really sweaty.
[02:08:54.030 --> 02:08:56.590]  Oh, I'll send you some stickers.
[02:08:56.670 --> 02:08:57.350]  Some stickers.
[02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:58.630]  I got stickers all day long.
[02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:01.310]  I can't guarantee what they'll be, but there'll be cool fucking stickers.
[02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:04.470]  I'll send you all stuff in envelope with what I think will, they'll, they'll
[02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:06.750]  look at me like, bro, you need to pay extra shipping when I send these stickers.
[02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:07.550]  I'll stuff an envelope.
[02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:08.950]  So here's, here's the task.
[02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:12.310]  Pajamas mullet at Walmart.
[02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:13.030]  That's your picture.
[02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.910]  Three things.
[02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:14.190]  Yep.
[02:09:14.590 --> 02:09:15.750]  I want you to send it to me.
[02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:18.750]  Um, you can just tweet it to me.
[02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:23.870]  Uh, at GFYH podcast, tweet it to me and then hashtag it mullet challenge.
[02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:27.230]  I'm going to write that down cause that's fucking, that's
[02:09:27.230 --> 02:09:27.950]  brilliant.
[02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:31.790]  If Fred wins this one too, I'm going to be a little ashamed
[02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:32.790]  of some of the other listeners.
[02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:36.910]  No, I legitimately wrote that down.
[02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:39.590]  Do they have Walmart's in Australia?
[02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:43.350]  Is WebKit or is Seb going to have to drive like 600 miles to, to
[02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:44.190]  attack this challenge?
[02:09:44.190 --> 02:09:47.630]  If you're in another country, if you're in, if you're in a place that doesn't
[02:09:47.670 --> 02:09:50.150]  have, we will email you pictures of stickers, Seb.
[02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:54.390]  Seb, I can't mail you stickers, dude.
[02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:56.630]  You're in Australia and that's going to be so expensive.
[02:09:56.630 --> 02:09:59.390]  I looked and I researched how much it would cost to send him a shirt and the
[02:09:59.390 --> 02:10:01.710]  shipping was just more than what the shirts are even worth.
[02:10:02.190 --> 02:10:04.230]  I was like, no, dude, no, I'm not going to do it.
[02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:04.670]  Sorry.
[02:10:05.150 --> 02:10:08.750]  I just, uh, I looked up what it takes to send stuff to Costa Rica recently.
[02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:11.190]  And I was like, dad ain't getting pictures of the kid.
[02:10:12.590 --> 02:10:13.670]  Dad could use Facebook.
[02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:15.110]  It's going to have to be good enough.
[02:10:15.110 --> 02:10:15.470]  Yeah.
[02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:20.030]  Uh, so at least you can man United States citizens only in the continental
[02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:22.790]  United States, uh, are qualified for this.
[02:10:22.830 --> 02:10:24.230]  Sorry, but I tried.
[02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.950]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:27.310]  I just, I can't be shipping shit across the world.
[02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.630]  Yeah.
[02:10:27.670 --> 02:10:31.030]  I'm glad we were able to disappoint you now and not after you drove
[02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:32.390]  six hours to the Walmart.
[02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.590]  Yeah.
[02:10:33.630 --> 02:10:34.110]  Sorry, mate.
[02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:37.070]  Uh, so yeah.
[02:10:37.110 --> 02:10:39.390]  Well, a mullet challenge, you guys do it.
[02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.950]  Mullet.
[02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:41.910]  I want to see some good Mullet pajamas.
[02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.990]  Walmart.
[02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:46.230]  I could probably drive seven minutes and find that.
[02:10:46.630 --> 02:10:49.470]  And I bet that's happening right up the street, right up the street.
[02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:50.030]  I'm sure.
[02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.590]  All right.
[02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:55.150]  You want to put this podcast back on some rails, Colorado rails.
[02:10:55.150 --> 02:10:57.230]  We've been all over the place since we started.
[02:10:57.230 --> 02:10:58.550]  I don't know what's even happening.
[02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.270]  I love you too.
[02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.790]  Listeners.
[02:10:59.830 --> 02:11:00.150]  Yeah.
[02:11:00.190 --> 02:11:01.950]  Sometimes I'm mean, but you know, I love you.
[02:11:02.070 --> 02:11:04.510]  He's not that he's just, he's an asshole.
[02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:06.150]  Sometimes I mean, it's okay.
[02:11:06.150 --> 02:11:09.110]  So I know if you're coming from out of state, you can now purchase an ounce of
[02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:10.390]  can buy an ounce people.
[02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:11.230]  Welcome to the club.
[02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.710]  Yeah.
[02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.950]  Yeah.
[02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:12.670]  You can eat it.
[02:11:12.710 --> 02:11:15.830]  No, no more plastic chairs, little plastic table at dinner for you.
[02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:18.270]  Now you don't have to drive to four different dispensaries to have an ounce
[02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:20.230]  of weed or run to your car four times.
[02:11:20.230 --> 02:11:20.630]  That was good.
[02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:25.030]  So do when we made them drive around the store, it legitimately caused traffic
[02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.430]  issues.
[02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:29.070]  Do you think, uh, do you think people are going to try to do that and buy more
[02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:29.590]  ounces?
[02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:31.030]  Do you think that's going to happen?
[02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:36.350]  Um, I think that you said you wanted a list of the benefits and the cons.
[02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:38.430]  And I think that's the con.
[02:11:39.070 --> 02:11:44.430]  Um, I think the dipshit from two States over that comes here, drops his monthly
[02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:49.910]  paycheck, drives all that home and flips it a couple of times a year.
[02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:53.870]  I think that's going to get a little, or at least has the potential to get a
[02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:54.550]  little worse.
[02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:58.670]  And the more of those idiots that get caught, the worse we look, the more heat
[02:11:58.670 --> 02:11:59.310]  on us.
[02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.670]  Right.
[02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:01.430]  We don't need any more black eyes right now.
[02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:01.990]  That is true.
[02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:05.070]  He said black eyes, by the way, black eyes.
[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:05.470]  Yeah.
[02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:06.750]  Just to clear that up.
[02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:12.710]  Um, the cannabis industry is under a lot of fire right now, honestly.
[02:12:12.710 --> 02:12:16.950]  And if we can't keep our best foot forward, we're going to be a past tense
[02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:20.310]  here in three or four years instead of bigger and better than ever.
[02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.990]  Very true.
[02:12:21.630 --> 02:12:22.750]  Very, very true guys.
[02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:23.750]  Quit shipping stuff.
[02:12:24.230 --> 02:12:25.350]  I can't ship you anything.
[02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.790]  Don't ask.
[02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:29.830]  I've seen, saw three or four posts this week on social media of people saying
[02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:32.230]  it just straight up, stop fucking asking.
[02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:34.510]  Like, we're not going to mail you anything.
[02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:36.310]  We're not going to send you anything.
[02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:40.990]  Um, I'm not going to sleep with you for weed, like just the most obnoxious shit.
[02:12:41.550 --> 02:12:43.110]  Um, just knock it off.
[02:12:43.150 --> 02:12:45.150]  Like none of that exists here anymore.
[02:12:45.150 --> 02:12:46.150]  We got rid of all of it.
[02:12:46.590 --> 02:12:47.390]  Just go to the store.
[02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:48.230]  We like it this way.
[02:12:48.230 --> 02:12:50.830]  Point at the jar you like and you buy as much as you can afford.
[02:12:50.910 --> 02:12:52.070]  Then you go home and puff.
[02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:52.390]  Yep.
[02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:55.990]  But every time another package gets caught in the mail or another putz from
[02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:58.990]  another state gets caught with 300 plants in his backyard going, but I
[02:12:58.990 --> 02:13:00.550]  thought weed was legal here.
[02:13:01.150 --> 02:13:05.030]  Like the whole industry takes a huge hit.
[02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:07.950]  Um, and if we take enough of those, we're done.
[02:13:08.070 --> 02:13:09.550]  And I really like my job people.
[02:13:09.630 --> 02:13:12.510]  I don't know if you can, you get that inflection over the radio.
[02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:13.430]  I love my job.
[02:13:14.150 --> 02:13:17.030]  Um, even with all the crap I have to deal with because of it, like,
[02:13:17.630 --> 02:13:19.030]  I don't want to go do drywall again.
[02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:20.110]  I really like this.
[02:13:20.230 --> 02:13:23.310]  I really like being able to grow cannabis on a large scale without having
[02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:24.550]  to watch over my shoulder all day.
[02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:26.990]  I'm done working with jail, broken teenagers.
[02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:28.710]  Like I work in the cannabis industry now.
[02:13:28.710 --> 02:13:32.630]  I swear to God, if you fuck this up, I will be famous for being an ax murderer,
[02:13:32.630 --> 02:13:34.270]  chasing down all the idiots who ruined it.
[02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:41.270]  Those statements are only supported by a white mic, not the opinions
[02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:43.030]  of the podcast.
[02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:44.910]  It's just so obnoxious watching people.
[02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:45.470]  Fuck this up.
[02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.830]  Yeah.
[02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.150]  All right.
[02:13:46.150 --> 02:13:47.470]  Let's talk about some of the pros then.
[02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:50.470]  So the pros, this is huge for out of staters.
[02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:51.430]  You can buy an ounce.
[02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:52.230]  Just like a big boy.
[02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:56.470]  Um, for shops it, I mean, it makes life so much easier for me.
[02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:57.630]  I can stop counting to seven.
[02:13:58.150 --> 02:14:00.070]  It was like half my day is a butt tender.
[02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:01.870]  Like one, two, three, four, five, six.
[02:14:01.870 --> 02:14:02.070]  Yep.
[02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:02.470]  We're good.
[02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:03.710]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[02:14:03.710 --> 02:14:03.910]  Nope.
[02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:05.750]  You're gonna have to do trend to transactions, sir.
[02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:06.910]  You're going to have to run out your car.
[02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:07.230]  Why?
[02:14:07.230 --> 02:14:08.190]  Cause that's the rule.
[02:14:08.190 --> 02:14:08.630]  Deal with it.
[02:14:08.630 --> 02:14:09.310]  Just seven.
[02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.950]  It's all you get.
[02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:14.230]  Um, I have ludicrous metaphors to just shut people up immediately with, oh,
[02:14:14.230 --> 02:14:15.190]  that this is ludicrous.
[02:14:15.190 --> 02:14:16.870]  How do you guys just shut up?
[02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:18.950]  I don't want to have that conversation at nine time today.
[02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:22.790]  So I've got sentences that just shut it down, but we get, we get rid of all of
[02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:23.030]  that.
[02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:28.110]  Um, I hope they leave the edibles and the concentrates purchase limits alone.
[02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:31.990]  Um, and that those don't get end up still getting cranked down in November.
[02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:34.550]  Um, it makes stuff so much easier on us.
[02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:37.550]  We're the only industry on the planet where you can't buy what you can pay for.
[02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:38.270]  Right.
[02:14:38.590 --> 02:14:42.710]  Like when you think about what purchase limits is actually mean and where they
[02:14:42.710 --> 02:14:44.790]  apply elsewhere in the world, it's just nuts.
[02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:49.230]  And now I think something that's helpful is now you can try more variety before
[02:14:49.230 --> 02:14:51.990]  you'd go and you'd get an eighth of that and an eighth of that, and then that's
[02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.790]  what you got to smoke on.
[02:14:53.150 --> 02:14:56.870]  Now you can get a real variety without destroying the price on you.
[02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.430]  Yeah.
[02:14:57.670 --> 02:15:05.030]  When you get seven grams instead of two eights or a quarter, you pay a lot more.
[02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:07.270]  Um, you miss out on all the price breaks.
[02:15:08.590 --> 02:15:08.830]  Okay.
[02:15:09.070 --> 02:15:13.150]  So picking up four eights is a lot better economically than picking up seven grams
[02:15:13.150 --> 02:15:15.870]  split four ways per gram.
[02:15:16.670 --> 02:15:17.190]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:17.590 --> 02:15:17.910]  Okay.
[02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:18.990]  Like by miles.
[02:15:19.230 --> 02:15:19.590]  All right.
[02:15:19.670 --> 02:15:20.870]  And then you get more herb.
[02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:21.990]  That's one of the advantages.
[02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.230]  Yeah.
[02:15:22.230 --> 02:15:22.790]  More weed.
[02:15:23.150 --> 02:15:24.630]  There's a lot more weed store.
[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:25.550]  Dude, fewer trips.
[02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:28.150]  You have to go to and from the dispensary less times.
[02:15:28.350 --> 02:15:29.390]  You have to go stand in line.
[02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:32.550]  You have to, don't have to deal with that dickhead security guard as many times.
[02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:35.590]  You don't have to pull out your ID and your card and sit there and wait and then
[02:15:35.590 --> 02:15:39.710]  go hit the ATM and pull out money as many times and then go see some person that
[02:15:39.710 --> 02:15:42.350]  doesn't really want to deal with you asking questions.
[02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:49.390]  It's a, no, your butt tender's happy with questions or if they're not, find a better
[02:15:49.390 --> 02:15:49.790]  shop.
[02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.270]  Yeah.
[02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.950]  And tip them.
[02:15:51.190 --> 02:15:54.670]  Um, yeah, if you're watching this good tip your button to that worked really hard.
[02:15:54.710 --> 02:15:55.790]  They gave you a lot of knowledge.
[02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:59.790]  And then of course, if your legal limit is an ounce, why can't we buy an ounce?
[02:16:00.150 --> 02:16:00.350]  Yeah.
[02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:01.550]  Like, duh.
[02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:02.350]  That seems weird.
[02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:04.670]  Don't make me go to four places to get my legal limit.
[02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:06.870]  Are you just trying to make me shop at four different places?
[02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.310]  Right.
[02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:13.350]  And do you think places are going to lose business because, uh, the guys that are
[02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:16.830]  going to buy the guys there, there are obviously people that come from out of
[02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:18.270]  town or out of state to do this.
[02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:21.350]  They come and they just buy stuff to go to the second shop.
[02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:25.670]  That wasn't like shop a gets hit first, like their favorite shop, the shop that
[02:16:25.670 --> 02:16:28.670]  has the best price to the best selection, whatever that is.
[02:16:28.670 --> 02:16:30.790]  So now does shop B lose three quarters?
[02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:34.310]  Shop B loses at least a second visit.
[02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:36.950]  Or does he go to shop B and buy a whole nother ounce?
[02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:38.270]  Cause now it's that much easier.
[02:16:38.310 --> 02:16:41.990]  It really, I think the people that were doing that anyway, cause a lot of shops
[02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:43.430]  allowed you to make four visits.
[02:16:43.430 --> 02:16:48.150]  So they just made four visits at a, made four visits at B or went to a, went to
[02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:50.350]  B, went to a, went to B, went to a.
[02:16:50.390 --> 02:16:50.790]  Damn.
[02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:55.550]  Um, we would have people bitch about like how far apart we were from the others.
[02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:59.310]  Uh, from time to time in the bedroom, they're like, yeah, I don't know.
[02:16:59.350 --> 02:17:00.590]  Making the drive one more time.
[02:17:00.590 --> 02:17:01.750]  Getting, getting a little dizzy.
[02:17:02.430 --> 02:17:04.830]  It's like, dude, quit being a douche.
[02:17:05.710 --> 02:17:06.910]  Don't tell us about it.
[02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:07.630]  Just do it.
[02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:09.910]  All right.
[02:17:10.550 --> 02:17:14.230]  So, but yeah, so we've got a little list of pros and cons that I'm
[02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:15.430]  really happy this rule passed.
[02:17:15.430 --> 02:17:16.550]  It makes my life simpler.
[02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:20.790]  Um, it has the potential to increase business a little bit, but not, not
[02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:24.990]  dramatically to the people, to the better dispensaries that like we were talking
[02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:27.710]  about, maybe that second and third tier dispensary, you're going to lose that
[02:17:27.710 --> 02:17:29.270]  second quarter that would have gotten sold.
[02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:31.750]  If the guy had money for a half, it's probably just going to buy that whole
[02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:32.910]  half ounce at the good shop.
[02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:34.990]  Now, if he was going to buy an ounce, he's gonna buy it all there.
[02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:40.750]  Um, the other little downside is everyone that moved here for marijuana.
[02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:45.230]  Had it a big incentive to go get their ID changed.
[02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:49.230]  Um, when they went to the DMV and got their ID changed, they got registered to
[02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:49.510]  vote.
[02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:51.670]  We make that very easy here.
[02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:55.230]  Um, and that's going to slow down just a little bit.
[02:17:55.230 --> 02:17:55.790]  I think.
[02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:01.190]  Um, that's just another little, a negative in the negative column piece.
[02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:02.710]  There's not a lot of negatives to this.
[02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:03.350]  It's nice.
[02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:04.510]  I didn't think of how that went.
[02:18:04.630 --> 02:18:07.870]  As long as Texans don't torpedo it for us.
[02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:12.030]  Like I'm, I'm really happy about this, but yeah, I've, uh, pretty much everyone
[02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:13.630]  I talked to the moved here from marijuana.
[02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:14.150]  It's like, yep.
[02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:15.030]  Get my ID switched.
[02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.230]  Yep.
[02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.790]  Got registered.
[02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:18.350]  That's going to vote for you in November.
[02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:19.670]  Like that's pretty helpful.
[02:18:19.670 --> 02:18:19.830]  Yeah.
[02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:20.590]  I didn't even think of that.
[02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:23.510]  Cause I've been a resident for so long that I never thought about how to switch
[02:18:23.510 --> 02:18:26.150]  my ID and you're not dealing with the crowd at the door.
[02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:27.270]  Like I am.
[02:18:27.390 --> 02:18:31.110]  Um, the people I talked to were, are inquiring about how to go medical.
[02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:31.950]  Yeah.
[02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:34.030]  You work for a medical dispensary, right?
[02:18:34.350 --> 02:18:35.310]  In the grow even.
[02:18:35.310 --> 02:18:36.790]  So you're not even handling patients.
[02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:37.190]  Yeah.
[02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:38.430]  I go there occasionally.
[02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:42.430]  I drop off product and I go purchase my own products, but I spent very little
[02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:43.390]  time there, but I see.
[02:18:43.710 --> 02:18:43.910]  Yeah.
[02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:45.150]  I see patients come and go.
[02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.510]  And yeah.
[02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:49.510]  If I see the first wave, when they get here, basically, I think
[02:18:49.510 --> 02:18:51.190]  they just enacted a new rule.
[02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:53.630]  It starts either the first, it starts on the 1st of July.
[02:18:53.630 --> 02:18:57.710]  I think that if you are trying to use your extended plant count at a medical
[02:18:57.710 --> 02:19:00.630]  facility, you have to be a member of that facility now.
[02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:01.750]  Is that an official rule?
[02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:04.350]  I knew that was the policy that a lot of shops had.
[02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:04.550]  Yeah.
[02:19:04.550 --> 02:19:07.630]  They've made an official rule is what I think I saw on the door at one of the
[02:19:07.630 --> 02:19:12.910]  stores and they're really looking to crack down on some, some of the, um,
[02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:16.510]  abuses that can take place in the medical market.
[02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:21.190]  They're going overboard in my opinion, but like they've had it, they've
[02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:24.270]  caught enough really shady shit that like it, I'm not surprised the
[02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:25.950]  regulators are pissed and cracking down.
[02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:27.990]  Colorado people with the medical card.
[02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:31.510]  Um, if that shit's getting close to expiring, go renew it because it's
[02:19:31.510 --> 02:19:33.830]  taking a long time for my renewal to come in.
[02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:34.110]  Yep.
[02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:34.830]  Yeah.
[02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:36.230]  And here's what sucks.
[02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:38.350]  You can't shop if you don't have your actual card.
[02:19:38.350 --> 02:19:42.790]  If your old card, you can only go get your new card 30 days before
[02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:44.070]  your old card expires.
[02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:48.630]  You can't renew within 30 days of the old one expiring, but it takes about
[02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:53.590]  45 days for your new card to come in the mail and you're not allowed to shop in
[02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:56.870]  a dispensary until you have that new permanent card in the mail.
[02:19:57.390 --> 02:19:58.550]  So there's going to be about it.
[02:19:58.870 --> 02:20:02.270]  Right now it's been a couple of week gap before I've been able to shop.
[02:20:02.310 --> 02:20:03.870]  Depending on how you plan for it.
[02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:05.070]  It can be a nasty gap.
[02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:06.350]  I see those people too.
[02:20:06.390 --> 02:20:10.110]  I've got a regular doctor that I go to for my MMJ recommendation and I've got
[02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:11.990]  to schedule an appointment and he's been so busy.
[02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:14.270]  It took me, uh, several days to get in there.
[02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:15.750]  I couldn't get in as quickly as I wanted to.
[02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:16.830]  I think it was about two weeks.
[02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:21.310]  So that put me two more weeks behind and then, yeah, so that puts me six weeks out
[02:20:21.310 --> 02:20:23.110]  and then it's taking about eight weeks, I think.
[02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:25.470]  Oh, I need a car.
[02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:26.230]  It's all right.
[02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.950]  It's all right.
[02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.470]  I grow.
[02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:28.230]  I do my thing.
[02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:29.750]  Luckily I'm stocked up.
[02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:31.190]  We'll be all right.
[02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:32.390]  Life is good.
[02:20:32.670 --> 02:20:33.790]  Life is never bad.
[02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:34.430]  Life's always good.
[02:20:34.430 --> 02:20:35.230]  Life's what you make of it.
[02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:38.630]  Grabbing a shitty time, take a fad dab and fix it.
[02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.470]  Yep.
[02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.870]  Yep.
[02:20:40.830 --> 02:20:42.910]  That's that dabble fix just about any day.
[02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:44.630]  Mike, we've been going for about 40 minutes.
[02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:45.750]  We covered some good points.
[02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.910]  We did some, uh, we did some educating.
[02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:49.110]  We had cannabis news.
[02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:53.630]  We had cannabis education and we certainly had cannabis conversation.
[02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:55.070]  So we fucking nailed it on this one.
[02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.790]  We really did.
[02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:57.310]  That's three for three people.
[02:20:57.430 --> 02:20:57.870]  Boom.
[02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:59.030]  Round of applause for you.
[02:20:59.030 --> 02:21:00.270]  High five across the table, bro.
[02:21:00.350 --> 02:21:01.190]  We nailed that shit.
[02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:02.870]  We literally did high five you guys.
[02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:03.750]  That was no bullshit.
[02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:05.590]  I barely heard that through my headphones.
[02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:06.510]  That's really high.
[02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:07.110]  That's a compressor.
[02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.590]  Sound equipment.
[02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:08.150]  That's a compressor.
[02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.270]  Yeah.
[02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:09.310]  I got some compression on there.
[02:21:09.630 --> 02:21:11.870]  That was really, really, really nice beer.
[02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:15.190]  We don't sound this butter sweet in person.
[02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:16.550]  Oh yes I do.
[02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:19.950]  I've had people recognize me.
[02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:23.310]  I was at a, the mystic root show the other day and somebody goes, you look
[02:21:23.310 --> 02:21:26.830]  familiar and I go, uh, I work at the green and healthy wellness, um, I read
[02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:28.070]  genetics and she's like, nope.
[02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:30.030]  And I go, I do a podcast about cannabis.
[02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:31.350]  And she goes, Oh my God, that voice.
[02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:35.470]  Cause I said it like I do a podcast all about cannabis, just being a smart ass.
[02:21:35.470 --> 02:21:36.830]  And she's like, I recognize your voice.
[02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:37.990]  So if you still listen, shout out.
[02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.670]  I don't know if you do.
[02:21:39.470 --> 02:21:40.110]  Uh, but shout out.
[02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:40.830]  It was good to see you.
[02:21:40.990 --> 02:21:41.670]  That was, that was fun.
[02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:43.950]  Uh, what else we got?
[02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:44.950]  I think we got some shout outs.
[02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:45.990]  Hey Mike, thanks for joining me, bro.
[02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:48.910]  How do my friends that are listening follow you on social media?
[02:21:48.990 --> 02:21:52.670]  You can find me at, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:56.910]  And you can find me at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:59.310]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[02:21:59.670 --> 02:22:00.750]  Support that click.
[02:22:00.750 --> 02:22:01.710]  Like go there.
[02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:03.990]  Uh, comment positive stuff on there.
[02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:05.910]  Support what we, they are trying to do.
[02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:06.790]  I put myself in that.
[02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:07.230]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:08.670]  Support what Mike is trying to do.
[02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:14.510]  Um, Mike is probably the leading cannabis activist that I am aware of in this area.
[02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:16.510]  I've seen you team up with a few other cool people.
[02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:18.750]  So shout out to you guys for doing all that for us.
[02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:22.790]  A nice little team put together for this response effort to the, uh,
[02:22:22.830 --> 02:22:24.070]  the group trying to ban us.
[02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:27.070]  It's a, it's going to be a really fun year for me.
[02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:31.270]  Um, I might sleep through all the 2017 at this pace though, cause
[02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:32.510]  I'm kind of running myself ragged.
[02:22:32.590 --> 02:22:33.990]  No, you've got a little kid.
[02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:37.830]  So I really might, I might just throw down every penny I make this
[02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:41.990]  year to pay somebody else to keep them alive for until I wake up from my coma.
[02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:45.630]  When, when you have a child, sometimes when you're sleeping,
[02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:47.670]  you're dreaming about sleeping.
[02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.950]  Yep.
[02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.230]  Yep.
[02:22:48.350 --> 02:22:52.310]  It's a, I feel like a dick all the times I said I was tired
[02:22:52.310 --> 02:22:54.270]  before, like the last 10 months.
[02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:57.430]  I almost want to go back and apologize to the people with kids that I was
[02:22:57.430 --> 02:23:00.390]  talking to when I was like, man, I'm too tired, I don't want to be at work today.
[02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:03.270]  And they just gave me the look that I give people in their twenties now.
[02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:04.310]  And they say that shit at work.
[02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:07.190]  Like, yeah, it's crazy people.
[02:23:07.310 --> 02:23:07.710]  Yeah.
[02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:09.110]  We're savages at Argo.
[02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:12.270]  So I, yeah, I understand how you're feeling about being tired.
[02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:17.110]  And I'm doing like 40 a week at work in another 20 weeks on the campaign.
[02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:21.030]  And then I've got a 10 month old that I play with for like at least 30 hours a
[02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:25.390]  week, so I sleep for like three, five, eight hours a day, if I'm lucky,
[02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:28.070]  some of those play hours are random.
[02:23:28.390 --> 02:23:29.990]  Sometimes you expect it to be asleep.
[02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:32.630]  Two in the morning, we're up playing on the floor and he's in his
[02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:34.070]  bounce chair, just going off.
[02:23:34.110 --> 02:23:35.270]  And it's like, dude, it's.
[02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.630]  Quarter to three.
[02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:37.150]  What are you doing?
[02:23:38.350 --> 02:23:38.390]  Yeah.
[02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:41.550]  He's going to be like us when he gets older.
[02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:42.110]  He really is.
[02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.750]  Oh, bro.
[02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:44.910]  For some reason, Mike and I are both night owls.
[02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:47.910]  I thought it was great when we both discovered that we both liked to be
[02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:49.350]  fucking doing whatever happens.
[02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:52.590]  We used to build crows and people were like, when can you come do this?
[02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:53.110]  But I don't know.
[02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:54.270]  Can we show up at like midnight?
[02:23:54.270 --> 02:23:57.190]  And they think we're fucking crazy, but we'd just crush and grow out while
[02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:58.590]  everybody else was gone and build it.
[02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:01.870]  And they'd show up in the morning and be like, wow, a grow or the night we
[02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:05.590]  trim somebody's crop for them until the sun came up and they woke up and had
[02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:07.950]  several pounds from that weren't trimmed the night before.
[02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:10.390]  His wife made me leave, go home, get some rest.
[02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:11.310]  That was great.
[02:24:11.350 --> 02:24:11.590]  All right.
[02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:12.710]  Guys, thanks for listening.
[02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:13.630]  Shout out to elevate glass.
[02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:14.670]  Shout out to talk radio.
[02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:16.590]  Shout out to my friend, Jessica.
[02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:18.990]  Um, let's see who else?
[02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:20.670]  I think that's all I wrote down for shout outs.
[02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:21.470]  Uh, you guys
[02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:23.590]  shout out to your recent guests.
[02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:29.150]  Um, I love the last episode with, uh, the barefoot blower.
[02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.430]  Sorry.

[02:24:34.470 --> 02:24:34.950]  Sorry.
[02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:37.190]  Um, great show.
[02:24:37.390 --> 02:24:38.430]  Um, I've really liked
[02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:41.950]  Rob knows a lot about breeding.
[02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:43.710]  That's why I tried to bring him on for the
[02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:46.430]  I always love it when other people are on.
[02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:49.470]  Um, it makes me really wish that I was here to record that.
[02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:52.390]  Um, and then it makes me want to be a better guest.
[02:24:52.390 --> 02:24:53.150]  So great job.

[02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:59.750]  You notice how I didn't incite anyone to violence the show.

[02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:03.710]  I think you said something about becoming an ax murderer at some point.
[02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:05.150]  That was my personal.
[02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:07.310]  That's just where I see my life going.
[02:25:07.310 --> 02:25:12.030]  If a idiot screw up legalization, that's just, I don't know.

[02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:09.270]  I like the crazy crystal.
[02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:13.360]  No way.

[02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:04.680]  We legalize the green.

[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:30.620]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:31.420]  That's right.

[02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:36.700]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist

[02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:05.100]  Welcome to the show, hon.
[02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:06.020]  Hi, hi, hi.
[02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:08.180]  You had it word for word.
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:10.180]  Yeah, I told you one day I'm going to do it.
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:10.860]  You could do it.
[02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:11.660]  You want to try it right now?
[02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:12.500]  You want to start over?
[02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:13.300]  We can hit rewind.
[02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:14.220]  We can go back.
[02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:17.180]  I told you, you're never going to see it coming.
[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:18.140]  It's just going to happen.
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:20.020]  She's going to push me to like, it's like a ninja dab.
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:21.780]  Push me to the side and take over.
[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:22.380]  For sure.
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:22.740]  Yeah.
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:24.980]  Well, you remember, you remember what happened to Clint when he did that?
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:29.420]  That other voice you hear jiggling over there, that handsome voice,
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:30.580]  that's Dudley voice.
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:31.460]  That's our buddy, White Mike.
[02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:32.620]  Welcome back to the show, brother.
[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:33.660]  Thanks, man.
[02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:35.780]  Lindsey, we apologize for not having you last time.
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:37.340]  Oh, it was a boys club.
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:38.500]  And I don't mind.
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.660]  I don't mind that at all.
[02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:45.780]  Gosh, yeah.
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:46.580]  Shout out to Lindsey.
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:48.220]  She brought a bunch of live resin.
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:49.220]  I was going to give her a shout out.
[02:34:49.220 --> 02:34:52.140]  And I got all choked up about it, maybe because she made me take a gigantic,
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.300]  ridiculous glob of some live resin.
[02:34:54.660 --> 02:34:55.100]  Thank you.
[02:34:55.100 --> 02:34:55.860]  It was amazing.
[02:34:55.860 --> 02:34:56.820]  But holy crap.
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:57.780]  What are you trying to do to me?
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:34:59.540]  I don't know.
[02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:03.300]  I've had a little bit of a head cold or a sinus infection or some stupid shit
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:04.740]  slowing me down for a couple of days.
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:08.900]  I'm fighting it off and trying to take small dabs over here for a change
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:10.100]  and take good care of myself.
[02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:13.940]  I've been taking a vitamin supplement, drinking double the water and shit.
[02:35:13.940 --> 02:35:16.220]  And this girl shows up and globs me the fuck out.
[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:18.900]  I saw her hand it over and thought, oh, it's going to be one of those
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:20.060]  shows tonight.
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:22.260]  I just I haven't seen you in a couple of days.
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:24.900]  So to be honest, I didn't know you were taking baby dabs.
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:25.500]  I appreciate it.
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.460]  Thank you for no, you made me.
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:28.780]  I said you didn't have to take it all.
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:30.460]  Then did I? I did it.
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:32.180]  I would have split it with you or something.
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:35.380]  I stepped up to the plate and I needed it and I feel better for having done it.
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:39.380]  Well, I'm glad I feel like a true, a true cannabis.
[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:41.700]  I don't know. Whatever. I'm dedicated as fuck.
[02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:43.340]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:45.780]  I did it. I'm a turk kid turked out.
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.380]  You guys, thanks for joining me. I'm super high.
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:48.460]  Thanks for coming over tonight.
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:51.380]  Absolutely. I think this podcast might have been doing this tonight.
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:52.300]  Might have been Mike's idea.
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:54.340]  Mike might have accidentally scheduled this for us.
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:57.060]  Yeah. Sometimes the plan just comes together.
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:35:58.460]  I like it when it works.
[02:35:58.460 --> 02:35:59.940]  So a couple of nights ago, I was chilling out.
[02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:00.820]  Oh, really quickly.
[02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:04.500]  Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs,
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:05.260]  Colorado.
[02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:08.540]  You guys, if you need smoking accessories of any sort,
[02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:10.380]  everybody in this room has been there.
[02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:12.020]  I think Mike's been there. Did I take you with me?
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:13.700]  Not yet. I don't think I've been.
[02:36:13.700 --> 02:36:14.900]  I just lied to our listeners.
[02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:17.020]  I apologize for misleading you.
[02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:19.260]  Mike will be at Elevate very soon.
[02:36:19.260 --> 02:36:20.300]  But Lindsay's been there.
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:24.460]  I have. Very affordable, high quality glass and super lovely ladies.
[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:26.060]  For sure. Super.
[02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:29.540]  There's a reason that the listeners don't know about my awesome rig
[02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:31.460]  and it's because it don't exist yet.
[02:36:31.460 --> 02:36:33.260]  Well, then we got to take you to Elevate one day.
[02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:36.380]  I throw all my rig money at my kid right now, but that's
[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:39.660]  I've got a little stash going and it's only a matter of time
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:40.900]  before I'm up to get something nice.
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:42.940]  They've got something affordable for you.
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:44.220]  This one is 200 bucks.
[02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:46.100]  The banger is only 20 bucks. Nice.
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:47.740]  Talk to him. Tell him you listen to the podcast.
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:49.020]  They might make something happen for you.
[02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:49.740]  Stuff like that.
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:51.300]  You know, affordable rigs are awesome rigs.
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:53.220]  So shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass.
[02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:54.580]  Big shout out to everybody over there.
[02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:56.060]  Absolutely. Big hugs.
[02:36:56.060 --> 02:36:57.620]  Fist bumps all around.
[02:36:57.620 --> 02:36:59.260]  517 South Tejon support that.
[02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:00.620]  You can get a carb cap and you get a banger.
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:02.620]  You get a new rig and get a recycler.
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:03.860]  You can get a case for your rig.
[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:04.700]  You can get some stickers.
[02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:06.260]  You can get some heady jewelry.
[02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:07.420]  All kinds of good shit in there.
[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:09.900]  It's got everything.
[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:12.260]  Let's get to the point of the show, you guys.
[02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:13.820]  I don't even know where this idea came from.
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:14.900]  I sent Mike a text message.
[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:18.220]  I said, hey, dude, let's do a podcast about dispensary etiquette.
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:22.940]  Mike is a bud tender at a recreational dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:26.820]  Anybody 21 and over is allowed to shop in that dispensary.
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:30.940]  If you've got a an ID, excuse me, an ID, a passport.
[02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:32.540]  What else works?
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:33.380]  Valid U.S.
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.180]  side issued ID.
[02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:37.180]  OK, that says you're 21 and over.
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:40.180]  Yep. Then you're able to go in there and buy an ounce of cannabis.
[02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:42.420]  Yep. An ounce for anyone now. Nice.
[02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:47.980]  And Lindsey works in a medical cannabis facility in Colorado Springs.
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:51.340]  Colorado Springs does not support any recreational cannabis.
[02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:52.340]  They only have medical.
[02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:54.020]  So you can only shop medically.
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:56.300]  You have to have your purple card.
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:57.380]  Yeah, it sounds so weird.
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:37:59.820]  Used to be a red card, but now you have to have your purple card.
[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:03.060]  So they've both got very similar experiences,
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:05.740]  yet very different experiences as bud tenders.
[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:08.900]  Lindsey is the dreadlocked bud tender at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:10.660]  So when you're there, give her a shout out, say what's up,
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:12.220]  let her know that you heard about her on the podcast.
[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:13.380]  Give her a fist bump.
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:14.140]  She's super busy.
[02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:15.820]  Just say, hey, I listen to you on the podcast.
[02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:18.340]  Let her move on because she's got shit to do, but she's not busy.
[02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:20.700]  Make sure you say hi to her.
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:21.580]  Support your bud tenders.
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:23.300]  And Mike is a buttender in Pueblo West.
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:26.340]  If you see him tending bud for you, give him a fist bump.
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:27.820]  Tell him I heard about you on the podcast.
[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:28.940]  Yes. Hi, folks.
[02:38:28.940 --> 02:38:31.220]  Mike was my bud tender at the spot.
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.860]  Yeah, that's my birthday.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:36.140]  My one and only time I've ever gone into the spot and bought something.
[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:37.940]  Mike was my bud tender. Nice.
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:40.380]  Yep. See, that could be you people.
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:42.020]  See, that's funny.
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:42.860]  Was he nice to you?
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:43.540]  Yeah, he was.
[02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:45.380]  He actually gave me a free T-shirt for my birthday.
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:46.420]  I was going to say birthday shirt.
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:47.380]  Was he informative?
[02:38:47.380 --> 02:38:48.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:48.540 --> 02:38:51.060]  Did he? Would you go back based on your experience with him?
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:53.020]  Oh, my God.
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:54.620]  You're so silly.
[02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:55.540]  Trolling you a little bit.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:57.380]  I was like, you're so goofy.
[02:38:57.380 --> 02:38:59.460]  I didn't know a performance reviewist could be part of the show.
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:01.460]  That's why I was like, what?
[02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:04.140]  You come in and you come in all the time.
[02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:05.540]  So I was like, oh, Jesus.
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:06.020]  No, you're all.
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.820]  Well, yeah, but you're wonderful to me. We're friends.
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:09.300]  I don't come in and annoy you.
[02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:10.420]  I'm not like, can I smell this jar?
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:11.220]  Can I smell this jar?
[02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:12.020]  Can I smell this jar?
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:12.780]  Yeah, I don't have any money.
[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:13.700]  I just want to smell jars.
[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:15.620]  I'm out. I'm not that guy.
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:17.340]  So is that the first one on the list?
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:19.100]  Because that's a great way to start.
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:20.020]  Let's do some introduction.
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:20.540]  We're going to talk.
[02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:22.980]  I don't think I even talked about what the did your headphones get out?
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:23.980]  I see you pointing at your ear.
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:25.620]  I'll just keep tapping until they come back in.
[02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:26.540]  Any better?
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:27.460]  No, no, no.
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:29.020]  Minor cut now. What the fuck?
[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:29.980]  Did it work? Awesome.
[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:33.140]  You had it right about here.
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.220]  OK, then this one's Lindsay.
[02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:35.500]  OK, yeah.
[02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:36.580]  Yeah. All right.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:37.780]  I'll just quit touching it. We're good.
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:38.980]  All right. OK. Sorry, listeners.
[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:39.700]  You're good.
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:41.740]  This piece of gear now
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:45.220]  fading in and out right to left now.
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.780]  Really? What you did to me, bro.
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:47.700]  But I'm perfect.
[02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:50.060]  So that's how about this?
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:52.380]  Bump, bump, bump. We good. There we go.
[02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:54.100]  Headphone check. All right. Sorry, listeners.
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:39:57.180]  I hope your headphones are working as well.
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:58.940]  We might be able to edit.
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:00.060]  And probably not.
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:01.500]  Sorry, folks.
[02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:03.620]  That little box is evil.
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:05.540]  This will go live to drive.
[02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:08.260]  So we're going to do a podcast that is about dispensary etiquette.
[02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:11.500]  How a dispensary shopper should conduct themselves properly
[02:40:11.500 --> 02:40:13.700]  to not make themselves look like an asshole
[02:40:13.700 --> 02:40:16.100]  and not to annoy the fuck out of the dispensary workers.
[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:19.780]  So both my friends work in dispensaries.
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:21.260]  I've got a lot of dispensary work.
[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:23.700]  I was the the fucking person.
[02:40:23.700 --> 02:40:25.780]  I did basically everything right.
[02:40:26.100 --> 02:40:28.340]  You've got plenty of budgeting experience as well.
[02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:30.460]  Yeah, I grew the weed. I bud tended for a long time.
[02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:32.700]  I opened and closed the shop. I did the bank deposits.
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:34.580]  So I've got a lot of dispensary experience.
[02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:38.180]  We started doing this back when we're like bud tending was being invented.
[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:40.780]  Like what looked like we sort of created.
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:43.620]  There was no marijuana enforcement division tracking system.
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:44.860]  There was no regulation.
[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:46.940]  There was no proper zoning.
[02:40:46.940 --> 02:40:49.260]  There was none of that shit, which is why we don't have a shop now,
[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:51.340]  because we kind of made all the rules.
[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:54.460]  They decided, let's make rules that pushes them out
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:56.620]  is what made all the rules for our community here.
[02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:58.100]  That's how the rules were made.
[02:40:58.100 --> 02:40:59.820]  Yeah, that was a piece of it for sure.
[02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:01.660]  Whatever fucks them. That's the new rule.
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:02.940]  That's how they worked on it.
[02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:05.300]  So we're going to talk a little bit how to conduct yourself
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.860]  like a proper gentleman or gentlewoman in a dispensary,
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:09.860]  since all my friends work here.
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:11.260]  And the.
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.660]  The tips are going to be a little bit like everybody
[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:18.940]  and then kind of pro level because we have a rec shop and a medical shop.
[02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:21.580]  The expectations are going to be a little bit different
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:24.620]  in those two different marketplaces.
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:27.060]  That's because one's medical, one's one's rec.
[02:41:27.780 --> 02:41:32.140]  One one customer type is just anybody walking in off the street
[02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:36.620]  or drove here from a neighboring state to check it out for the first time.
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:39.580]  And the other has like joined a state program and should know
[02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:44.340]  considerably more about the product and the selection and whatnot
[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:45.700]  when they walk in.
[02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:48.060]  Like I said, should not. Should.
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:51.620]  But also the first couple of times may require much more guidance.
[02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:52.940]  Right. The first couple of.
[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:55.380]  One of the things I really wanted to stress for this show
[02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:57.580]  is questions are totally appropriate.
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:42:02.100]  There that might not be appropriate in that moment.
[02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:07.260]  I had a guy recently that asked me, is this a good time to ask a lot of questions?
[02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:09.340]  I noticed you guys are usually busy.
[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:12.100]  It's slow now.
[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:13.900]  And I said, sure, dude, it's dead right now.
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:14.660]  I have fire away.
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:19.260]  And it turns out this guy had been shopping with us for like six or seven weeks.
[02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:23.100]  Like he was enough that I knew his face and kind of knew what his order was going to be.
[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:27.820]  But he really had no clue what he was doing was a marijuana novice
[02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:31.740]  and needed everything kind of broken down for him, all the lingo,
[02:42:32.540 --> 02:42:35.180]  all the different products he'd just been coming in, buying a joint,
[02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:38.780]  taking it home, unrolling it and smoking a little bit of it
[02:42:38.780 --> 02:42:41.620]  in the tiny cheap ass glass pipe we sold him his first time in.
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:47.140]  And since then, I've kind of set him up and showed him the ropes and got him going.
[02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:49.540]  But like he just waited for the right time to ask questions.
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:52.700]  People should be free to ask those questions.
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:53.980]  Come in and do it.
[02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:59.180]  But if there's a long ass line and it's 100 degrees outside and everybody in the lobby is impatient,
[02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:01.900]  don't smile at me big and go, it's my first time.
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:03.260]  Tell me about everything in depth.
[02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:04.260]  I want to know everything.
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:08.780]  And then listen to the answers to the questions, because if you ask me for a third time
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:14.620]  in under five minutes, it's going to be hard not to be, I don't know, disappointed in you.
[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:18.620]  Sorry, did I just go off on a little rant?
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:19.180]  We like it.
[02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:20.860]  We love it when you ramble.
[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:21.820]  We love it when you ramble.
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:22.460]  That's perfect.
[02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:24.740]  You guys were dishing out the dabs.
[02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:25.900]  This is partially on you.
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:28.260]  Be aware is what I took from that.
[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:30.820]  Just be aware of if there's a time and place for everything.
[02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:34.740]  Is this the time and place to ask a million questions or are there a hundred people in line?
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:38.180]  Yes, we would love to treat every patient, every customer, every...
[02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:42.180]  So since it's not, this is an odd question, since it's not medical, what do you call the people?
[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:43.380]  Customer.
[02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:44.380]  They're just custies now.
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:44.700]  Okay.
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:51.140]  So we would try to treat every customer, every patient as it's their first time and they're golden.
[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:57.380]  But sometimes we have a line to move and there are people that are just getting pissed and the dispensaries have to stop taking orders at a certain time.
[02:43:57.700 --> 02:44:02.140]  And if they don't have everybody out of there, they'll get fined and the last shoppers in the place can't get rung up.
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:10.420]  So sometimes it is a rush to get through the crowd because not so much at the medical dispensaries, but the recreational dispensary that Mike represents, they're busy.
[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:14.060]  Sometimes there is a line and they got to rush through to get everybody out there.
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:14.460]  I don't know.
[02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:15.580]  We're kind of small.
[02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:27.900]  So sometimes like when we, I mean, you can't have more than one person to one, but like one group of, if you're all together, like there's two or three of you to one bud tender.
[02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:33.820]  So like, I can't have a lot of people in the bud tending room while it's just me.
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:40.380]  If like someone comes in with their friend, I can take both of them back and be back there by myself.
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:47.740]  But if anyone else comes back as a patient, then another bud tender or someone, another employee needs to come out on the floor.
[02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:56.620]  So it does actually, it can get kind of busy over at Green and Healthy just depending on like what happens, but that's because we're super tiny.
[02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:58.620]  And the whole place is super tiny.
[02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:00.260]  And there's usually two bud tenders there.
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:00.900]  Yeah.
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:01.740]  Yeah.
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:04.780]  We had Joe, well he had three in there today and I was like, well, thank God.
[02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:06.460]  Cause it got kind of like crazy at one point.
[02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:07.100]  And I was like, yes.
[02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:08.660]  Shout out to Hunt for covering shifts.
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:09.180]  For sure.
[02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:12.500]  I don't know if you, I don't think you listened to the show, bro, but either way, Hunt's getting a shout out.
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:15.620]  He's covering shifts at the grow and at the store and it's fucking rad.
[02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:16.260]  Good work, brother.
[02:45:16.260 --> 02:45:16.620]  Thank you.
[02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:20.980]  We appreciate having a boss that's willing to grab the fucking broom and sweep up when we need that shit done.
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:22.940]  He's not above any job, which is pretty cool.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:23.780]  I love it.
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:24.100]  Yeah.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:24.620]  That's dope.
[02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:33.620]  Um, so yeah, be aware if it's not the right time, don't go asking a bunch of questions, sneak a couple of questions in there as shit's happening while the bud tender is weighing stuff.
[02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:35.020]  Throw out some questions.
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:35.380]  For sure.
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:37.860]  Like what the one golden question that you really need answered.
[02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:38.700]  Try to throw that out.
[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:39.900]  Like, yeah.
[02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:41.700]  There, and there might be a manager that can help you.
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:47.980]  If you really have some questions, there's quite often a manager that needs something to do, and that's his job is to field that type of shit.
[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:52.820]  So find a manager and the bud tender may be happy to point you to one that may be your new strategy, bros.
[02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:54.340]  Terry can answer that or whoever the fuck is.
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:57.580]  I think I think there's nobody there named Terry, but
[02:45:57.620 --> 02:46:00.060]  we're very different as shop layouts.
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:07.740]  I mean, I might have 20 people in my, but 20 customers in my bedroom at one time, um, being helped by five or six different bud setters.
[02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:11.740]  Um, all this moving around, it can get like kind of crazy.
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:14.140]  And they play loud music in your bedroom too.
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:14.740]  It's loud.
[02:46:14.740 --> 02:46:22.300]  So yeah, there's music going and people go in and people come in and out, shopping, IDs getting checked, people waiting in line.
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:24.740]  And then other times it's super slow.
[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:26.820]  Um, like it just varies.
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:28.140]  All right.
[02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:31.580]  So we made a little, some, just a very short list of things to talk about here.
[02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:33.140]  Cause we wanted to have something to talk about.
[02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:35.980]  I know you guys like it when we ramble, but we want some structure to this madness.
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:44.820]  Uh, the first thing that you should think about when you're in the dispensary, a lot of you people that are listening, uh, this may not apply, but a lot of people need to think about this one.
[02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:46.740]  Uh, watch your mouth in the dispensary.
[02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:48.740]  I'm not saying you can't say the F word.
[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:55.620]  You can't, you can't use profanity, but if you have any intentions of the product that you are buying, leaving your hands, just keep your mouth shut about it.
[02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:56.700]  Don't hint about it.
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:57.740]  Don't joke about it.
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:46:59.740]  You're not going to flip that.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:01.540]  It is not for anybody else.
[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:03.500]  And you are not going to ship that product.
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:13.140]  If any of those things are going to happen, if you're even allowed the sale, the moment you walk out of the door, the bud tender and the manager have a little meeting together and they're like, Hey, fuck this guy.
[02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:21.180]  And they put you on the band list and we have it in the computer to where when we run your name that you're checking in, it pops up and says, do not sell to this customer.
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:24.020]  So don't, don't talk about it.
[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:26.140]  Don't you might do it.
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:27.380]  That might be your thing.
[02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:28.140]  Cool.
[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:31.340]  I'm not going to say do that, but I mean, fucking do that.
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:32.780]  If that's your thing, do your thing.
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.260]  Player, pip it out, but don't tell us about it.
[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:37.180]  We don't want to know about your black market hustle.
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:38.540]  We've gone legit for a reason.
[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:39.780]  We have to cut you off.
[02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:43.140]  If you tell us that we don't want to have to cut you off.
[02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:45.420]  So do your thing and just keep your mouth shut.
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:46.700]  Yeah.
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:51.380]  Legally, we are not allowed to sell you anything.
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:58.420]  Once you say to us that you are going to take that weed and redistribute it in any form.
[02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:06.820]  Um, at that point we have to refuse the sale and say, sorry, we can't sell you anything.
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:08.420]  You got to leave now.
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:09.020]  Thank you.
[02:48:09.340 --> 02:48:09.940]  Like it.
[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:11.820]  It's so serious.
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:19.500]  You can't, you can't walk into a bedroom and say, Oh, this, this two ounces of wax that I'm picking up are all going to go to Florida.
[02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:22.940]  You can't say like, I'm so like, thank you.
[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:23.700]  Have a great day.
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:24.860]  You'd think, yeah, that was fun.
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:26.020]  Thinking you were going to buy that.
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:26.940]  I get the same thing.
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:31.340]  I used to joke that I want to make a hat that says, stop asking me how to take this to Texas.
[02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:33.060]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:35.660]  Is it's, I mean, sometimes it's innocent.
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:41.580]  Like you look at, they'll look up and go like, do you think the drug dogs are going to smell the weed candy bar and the cooler?
[02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:46.220]  It, my response is always just a flat level look right in the eye and go, yeah.
[02:48:47.340 --> 02:48:49.260]  Like it's not magic.
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:56.700]  Um, and to make matters worse, it's been in a weed store full of other weed getting touched by people that touch weed over and over and over again.
[02:48:57.900 --> 02:49:04.780]  Like just because the chocolate happens to be in a child proof container doesn't mean it's special.
[02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:08.060]  Um, just stop.
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:11.700]  Like, we know that people are going to do this from time to time.
[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:12.900]  We can't stop you.
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:20.580]  But if you, um, articulate that in the bud room where we have to get refused the sale and kick you out.
[02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:21.220]  And that sucks.
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:22.340]  It's not fun for anybody.
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.940]  We don't want to kick people out.
[02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:24.980]  You don't want to get kicked out.
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:25.620]  Just knock it off.
[02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:25.940]  All right.
[02:49:25.940 --> 02:49:27.340]  So watch your mouth when you're in there, you guys.
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.460]  Sorry, we went off on a tangent, but they like it when we ramble.
[02:49:31.100 --> 02:49:35.260]  Uh, since Lindsay's here, here is something that we thought we should talk about when you're in the dispensary.
[02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:38.940]  Oftentimes there are beautiful young ladies working at the counter.
[02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:39.780]  They will greet you.
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:40.940]  They will take your ID.
[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:42.420]  They'll check your paperwork.
[02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:44.580]  Uh, don't fucking flirt with them.
[02:49:44.620 --> 02:49:45.940]  They're not there for you to flirt with.
[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:47.860]  Keep your dick in your pants at the dispensary.
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:48.820]  Chill out on that shit.
[02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:49.460]  They're trying to work.
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:50.220]  They got a job to do.
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:51.260]  They don't want to fucking hear it.
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:52.580]  They've been there all day working.
[02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:54.980]  They're not, they're not there for that.
[02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:55.780]  Just shut up.
[02:49:55.780 --> 02:49:56.700]  Keep it to yourself.
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:57.740]  Save it for later.
[02:49:58.100 --> 02:49:59.180]  They just leave Lindsay alone.
[02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:01.220]  Leave all the other hotties that work at the dispensary alone.
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:01.860]  They don't want to hear it.
[02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:02.900]  They're cool.
[02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:04.620]  You wouldn't even believe it.
[02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:06.140]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:08.980]  I've seen it once or twice when I was there shopping.
[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:10.340]  I'm like, that just happened.
[02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:11.540]  It's fucking funny.
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:15.220]  It's constant and it's disturbingly, uh, frequent.
[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:18.380]  Lindsay's one of my best friends and I love it when we hang out at events.
[02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:21.060]  Uh, people always think we're together cause she's got dreadlocks.
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:21.940]  I've got dreadlocks.
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:23.980]  We look like we could hang out.
[02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:24.420]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:25.540]  I wouldn't be surprised, you know?
[02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:28.140]  And people would know if we said we dated people like, yeah, I saw that coming.
[02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:31.340]  We became too good of friends and skip that phase.
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:34.380]  So, uh, but I love it when we hang out at events because people think we're
[02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:38.060]  together and guys don't bother her and girls don't even come talk to me.
[02:50:38.060 --> 02:50:40.860]  And a lot of times other dudes won't even come talk to me because they
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:43.260]  think I'm talking to a girl and they're like, I'll just leave them alone.
[02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:46.060]  And we just get to hang out and enjoy some time and some music and
[02:50:46.060 --> 02:50:47.380]  wherever we went for a few minutes.
[02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:48.100]  It's kind of nice.
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:49.220]  For next secret sesh.
[02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:49.500]  Yes.
[02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:50.340]  Secret session.
[02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:50.940]  Can't wait.
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:53.340]  I know when, I know when it's going to happen.
[02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:54.620]  I know when it's going to happen.
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:56.620]  The date got released on Monday.
[02:50:56.620 --> 02:50:57.140]  Did they really?
[02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:00.820]  That's when I third, I think I'm in Vegas that day.
[02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:01.700]  Yeah, you are.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:02.140]  I am.
[02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:04.780]  God, stop telling people that in the podcast.
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:08.500]  And I said that, God damn it.
[02:51:12.700 --> 02:51:14.300]  We're way off on some tangents.
[02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:17.260]  Man, my bad on the dabs earlier guys.
[02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:22.940]  We were like, Oh, yeah, my eyes are as red as the red in my Colorado shirt.
[02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:24.900]  I'm sitting here looking at it.
[02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:25.900]  Like I could go for a while.
[02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:27.380]  Take a dab, bro.
[02:51:27.940 --> 02:51:28.780]  We're not going to stop you.
[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:31.060]  If you think you could go for one more, we need you to do that.
[02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:32.540]  We need you where you want to be.
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:33.700]  You don't have a show to host.
[02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:34.820]  I'll drive.
[02:51:34.820 --> 02:51:36.340]  You just ramble in the middle.
[02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:37.340]  I'm on it.
[02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:40.300]  Like she just handed you the hash to take as big a dab as you want.
[02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:42.020]  Is that a lemon G?
[02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:43.420]  No, that is the cactus.
[02:51:43.420 --> 02:51:43.660]  Cool.
[02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:44.020]  Okay.
[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:44.460]  All right.
[02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:48.940]  It tastes like lemon G when I hit it, but it's very delicious.
[02:51:49.940 --> 02:51:52.300]  I finally ended up with a cut of that cactus cooler.
[02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:55.180]  I know we talked about that.
[02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:55.980]  I'm stoked.
[02:51:55.980 --> 02:51:57.620]  That's going to be fun to play with you guys.
[02:51:57.620 --> 02:51:58.300]  Cactus cooler.
[02:51:58.300 --> 02:52:01.060]  It tastes, if you've ever had a cactus cooler soda, it tastes just like it.
[02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:02.700]  And it sounds like bullshit, but it does.
[02:52:03.220 --> 02:52:07.020]  Is it crazy that it smells and tastes like fruit loops to me?
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:08.340]  And it's like flower form.
[02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:08.740]  Okay.
[02:52:08.740 --> 02:52:09.980]  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:10.300]  Okay.
[02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:11.540]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:12.060]  Okay.
[02:52:12.140 --> 02:52:12.580]  For sure.
[02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:15.860]  I like open up the jar of it the other day at the shop and I was like, get up on
[02:52:15.860 --> 02:52:16.940]  Mike a little bit, let him hear you.
[02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:19.460]  All right.
[02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:19.900]  That's enough.
[02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:20.460]  I was just kidding.
[02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:22.700]  Oh, what's that?
[02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:26.300]  We don't do this dying from a damn over here.
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:28.340]  Living.
[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:30.580]  Are you sure?
[02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:38.020]  I didn't give him the dad.
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:38.700]  I didn't kill him.
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:40.980]  He took it himself.
[02:52:41.580 --> 02:52:43.180]  The next bullet point wound.
[02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:46.460]  Next bullet point we've got written down is when you're at the dispensary and
[02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:50.540]  you're buying either the medical or the recreational dispensary, don't tell me
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:51.580]  how high you are.
[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:52.260]  I'm at work.
[02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:55.980]  I've been here for probably four or six hours and haven't had a chance to go
[02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:56.380]  blaze.
[02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:57.940]  And you're telling me I'm so high right now.
[02:52:57.940 --> 02:52:58.500]  Shut up.
[02:52:58.780 --> 02:52:59.820]  It's not like that.
[02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:00.740]  That's a good point.
[02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:01.980]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:03.020]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[02:53:03.500 --> 02:53:10.100]  But, um, the other thing is like you, you guys usually say that after you've done
[02:53:10.100 --> 02:53:14.820]  something either really wrong or said something really wrong or said something
[02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:19.460]  really illegal or like minimal, really embarrassing.
[02:53:19.580 --> 02:53:20.060]  Yeah.
[02:53:20.060 --> 02:53:21.220]  Like, oh man.
[02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:22.340]  Just drove here.
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:22.620]  Right.
[02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:23.980]  Like, and I don't understand.
[02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:26.780]  Um, I mean like, I just don't know if you're trying to look cool while you're
[02:53:26.780 --> 02:53:28.700]  saying it, but like, I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:30.980]  It really doesn't make you look cool.
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:35.660]  It just makes me think that you're an airhead stoner.
[02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:36.340]  I don't know.
[02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:38.140]  Yeah.
[02:53:38.140 --> 02:53:39.500]  That I'm so high right now.
[02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:42.380]  Thing gets a little old, especially when we're at work.
[02:53:43.300 --> 02:53:43.820]  Yeah.
[02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:45.700]  We wish we were stoned too, but we're at work.
[02:53:46.020 --> 02:53:46.860]  It gets a real job.
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:48.540]  That's something that a lot of people don't get.
[02:53:49.180 --> 02:53:51.740]  Um, the guy that works at the liquor store isn't drunk.
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:54.820]  Like, why does everyone assume we're baked out of our mind?
[02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:55.140]  Oh yeah.
[02:53:55.300 --> 02:53:58.860]  We can't smoke on the premises.
[02:53:58.860 --> 02:54:01.540]  You can't smoke within like a thousand feet away from that place.
[02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:02.580]  Can you smoke cigarettes on the...
[02:54:02.580 --> 02:54:03.660]  At the grow?
[02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:04.900]  No, at the grow.
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:05.220]  Or I mean...
[02:54:05.220 --> 02:54:07.460]  On the, on the dispensary premises.
[02:54:07.460 --> 02:54:10.980]  Like, isn't there like a, you have to be a certain feet away from...
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:12.060]  It's just policy.
[02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:17.100]  Usually anything that can be construed as marijuana consumption can get a
[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:18.300]  shop in a lot of trouble.
[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:21.380]  And so there are plenty of shops that don't even let people consume
[02:54:21.380 --> 02:54:22.820]  tobacco on the property.
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:25.700]  I don't like it when people roll into the dispensary and they're smoking a
[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:29.140]  cigarette because now I have to really sit there and look and see what you're
[02:54:29.140 --> 02:54:31.100]  smoking realistically.
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:36.300]  Because I mean, you guys just come in and say the weirdest stuff and most
[02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:37.020]  illegal stuff.
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:40.380]  So I have to assume you're coming in and doing it too.
[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:42.700]  That's just chill.
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:43.900]  Just chill.
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:44.540]  I like that.
[02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.500]  Chill the fuck out you guys.
[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:45.940]  It's cool.
[02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:48.700]  It's, you gotta remember what we're doing here.
[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:50.820]  Like, yes, it's a weed store.
[02:54:51.260 --> 02:54:51.620]  Yes.
[02:54:51.620 --> 02:54:54.260]  The people in it are also huge cannabis fans.
[02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:55.740]  We really like it too.
[02:54:56.180 --> 02:54:58.860]  We love getting dabbed to the point where we're fucking this high.
[02:55:00.540 --> 02:55:06.140]  But we don't roll into this supermarket and when we go to pay for our shit, like,
[02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:07.300]  yo, I'm so high right now.
[02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:08.900]  Some of us do.
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:09.860]  Some of us do.
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:10.380]  But like...
[02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:12.300]  Yeah, but it's the same people doing it at the dispensary.
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:13.300]  It's annoying there too.
[02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:15.620]  Knock it off, it's annoying there too.
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:19.100]  Well, I like the, whoever made the liquor store analogy.
[02:55:19.140 --> 02:55:19.900]  I think it was you Mike.
[02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:20.460]  Yeah.
[02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:23.820]  I like, you don't walk into the liquor store drinking.
[02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:26.260]  Why would you like, you know, it's just like...
[02:55:26.380 --> 02:55:27.460]  A lot of people do.
[02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:30.580]  Yeah, you gotta respect there's a business license at stake at these places.
[02:55:30.580 --> 02:55:30.820]  Yes.
[02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:34.380]  And the licenses are ridiculously expensive.
[02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:38.700]  And shops can lose them for very minor...
[02:55:38.740 --> 02:55:40.020]  For things that you do.
[02:55:40.140 --> 02:55:42.100]  Yeah, seemingly innocuous things.
[02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:48.140]  If customers, for example, check out, take their product and then walk into the
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:50.460]  bathroom with it, we can get fined.
[02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:54.700]  And so our security guard is forever on the lookout for anyone headed towards the
[02:55:54.700 --> 02:55:58.300]  bathroom just so we can make sure they don't happen to have a bag, a sealed
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:00.100]  product bag with them.
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:05.660]  Cause it could look like onsite consumption and just that somebody walking in there,
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:09.900]  setting the bag, the stuff they just bought on the paper towel dispenser, going to the
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:14.220]  bathroom, washing their hands and leaving could cost us our license.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:19.940]  And like, I don't really want to out the shops like annual gross or anything, but
[02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:24.500]  like we do a good business and that business employs a good number of people.
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:29.260]  And all of that's over because some dude took a shit next to a bag of marijuana he
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:30.100]  legally purchased.
[02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:36.540]  That license, just to get started, a million bucks, 600,000 to a million bucks just to
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:38.340]  get started with a dispensary.
[02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:40.820]  Yeah. And that's all your permits and stuff.
[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:45.860]  That's not even a place to have it, a place you have a grow.
[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:47.980]  There are so many more things to think about.
[02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:53.300]  That is just permitting, like, excuse me, permits and being licensed.
[02:56:53.540 --> 02:56:55.460]  This is a massive, massive industry.
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:57:00.260]  We couldn't at all do what we do under the level of scrutiny that we operate under if
[02:57:00.260 --> 02:57:01.380]  we were all baked all day.
[02:57:01.460 --> 02:57:04.340]  And that brings me to one of the next bullet points that we wrote down.
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:06.860]  Don't blame the rules on the bud tenders.
[02:57:07.540 --> 02:57:08.980]  A lot. I've seen people get mad.
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:11.260]  They've showed up to the spot dispensary where Mike works.
[02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:12.460]  Let's try not to say their name too much.
[02:57:12.460 --> 02:57:13.620]  But Lindsey called him out for us.
[02:57:13.740 --> 02:57:14.780]  Oh, my God. You're all right.
[02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:19.060]  I am no longer affiliated, so I don't say their name too much.
[02:57:19.620 --> 02:57:21.380]  No hatred or anything. Just let that be known.
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:26.540]  So they have a security guard right as you walk in security guard right there waiting
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:27.940]  for you. And he's like, I.D., please.
[02:57:27.980 --> 02:57:29.900]  And a lot of people like, who the fuck are you?
[02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:31.660]  Well, actually, who the fuck are you?
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:32.900]  You're coming into our place.
[02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:34.260]  You know, that's kind of the vibe right there.
[02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:36.180]  Don't walk into here and question authority.
[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:40.140]  Like that security guard is there to keep that place compliant, because if you're not
[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:45.260]  old enough, customers sit there and talk shit about him like it's not.
[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:48.780]  People do the weirdest shit at the weed store.
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:50.940]  The weirdest stuff.
[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:53.580]  Those security guards are only doing their job.
[02:57:53.580 --> 02:57:54.860]  The rules are and we have.
[02:57:54.980 --> 02:57:58.980]  Yes. And people that are that people that hate the security guard, a dude is just
[02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:03.140]  doing his job, making sure that people that aren't under 21 don't get in there because
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:04.900]  if people are under 21, get in there and buy weed.
[02:58:04.900 --> 02:58:06.100]  Guess what? Place closes.
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:10.220]  Then don't get mad at Mike or Lindsey when they won't sell you product illegally.
[02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:12.620]  There's a business license at stake here.
[02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:16.780]  Most of my listeners, we don't have to tell them this, but maybe they'll share this.
[02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:20.500]  There are cameras everywhere from at the grow.
[02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:24.660]  I can't go anywhere and not be I can barely close the bathroom door and then I'm not on
[02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:26.580]  camera as long as I'm in there with the bathroom door closed.
[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:29.380]  I'm not on camera. As soon as I walk out back on camera, time to go.
[02:58:29.580 --> 02:58:32.220]  Smile. You're on candid camera from every freaking angle.
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:37.740]  And the cameras are so good that if we lose a key, you can circle the key on the
[02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:38.820]  screen with your finger.
[02:58:38.820 --> 02:58:42.580]  You circle the key and then you can track the key in the video.
[02:58:42.580 --> 02:58:46.020]  The video will just follow the key from camera to camera and show you where it goes
[02:58:46.020 --> 02:58:48.260]  until you can find your keys that you lost earlier today.
[02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:49.620]  That's how good those cameras are.
[02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:53.220]  And so anybody that thinks that they're like, well, just do this for me.
[02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:55.020]  There's no just do this for me.
[02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:56.980]  Every time something happens, it's on camera.
[02:58:57.100 --> 02:58:58.740]  It's documented in a computer.
[02:58:58.900 --> 02:59:00.300]  There's no pulling no fast one.
[02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:01.740]  So there's no getting away with that shit.
[02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:06.820]  And nobody would risk their hundred thousand dollar facility or just to sell you an
[02:59:06.820 --> 02:59:09.460]  extra illegal gram or three or an ounce.
[02:59:09.460 --> 02:59:13.300]  It's not worth it. The other thirty to four hundred dollars they would make is not
[02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:16.700]  worth their business license because they have five other customers in line that are
[02:59:16.700 --> 02:59:17.900]  going to spend that already.
[02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:19.300]  They don't need to risk it on you.
[02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:21.180]  So don't don't ask people to break the rules.
[02:59:21.180 --> 02:59:24.940]  Don't be mad at Mike and Lindsay and myself, even that there are rules that have to be
[02:59:24.940 --> 02:59:27.340]  enforced. Just how that shit is.
[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:30.060]  We get to play. Let us play.
[02:59:30.580 --> 02:59:31.900]  We paid to play. Let us do it.
[02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:37.860]  Like I don't know, the stuff people complain about and the rules they break are so
[02:59:37.860 --> 02:59:40.900]  bizarre. That security guards there for your safety, too.
[02:59:41.660 --> 02:59:45.700]  We just had a shop in Aurora get robbed or where the security guard was shot three
[02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:47.900]  times and killed. I was just going to say that.
[02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:51.380]  And the one in the springs that got held up yesterday.
[02:59:51.420 --> 02:59:52.420]  I didn't see that one yet.
[02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:59.100]  Yeah. As as a whole, like the the statistics on it, dispensaries get robbed a lot less
[02:59:59.100 --> 03:00:04.140]  frequently than they should statistically, because most people know we have intense
[03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:07.940]  security set ups on every shop that's required.
[03:00:09.020 --> 03:00:12.940]  If you don't have a security system good enough to bust anybody doing something stupid
[03:00:12.940 --> 03:00:14.980]  on the property, you don't get a license.
[03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:16.620]  You don't get to be a marijuana business.
[03:00:17.140 --> 03:00:18.780]  That's just how it is in Colorado.
[03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:25.180]  So it's not as frequent as it could be, especially given the cash nature only in most
[03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:28.580]  of the business. But it's still an issue like the armed security guards there for a
[03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:32.020]  reason. The rules that we operate under are there for a reason.
[03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:38.940]  That reason might be and often is making some whining son of a bitch up in Denver
[03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:43.180]  that's operating from a place of fear and paranoia and has no idea what they're talking
[03:00:43.180 --> 03:00:45.540]  about. So they created some dumb ass rule we have to follow.
[03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:50.900]  But we're all willing to follow right now just to set a good example for legalization.
[03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:54.580]  Under no circumstances are we going to sell you over the limit?
[03:00:55.380 --> 03:00:58.220]  Under no circumstances are we going to tell you where you can buy pounds?
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:02.740]  Most of us don't even know anymore because why would we bother?
[03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:05.860]  Yeah, it's just not worth it.
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:11.900]  I can't stress enough how regulated the cannabis industry is.
[03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:14.020]  From seed to sale is what they call it.
[03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:17.180]  Absolutely. It is so regulated.
[03:01:17.180 --> 03:01:24.060]  And for all of you who don't live in Colorado and think that it is just some and when
[03:01:24.060 --> 03:01:28.140]  you come here, you guys think it's just some, you know, open system.
[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:30.180]  It's not. We are so regulated.
[03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:33.020]  And you guys are right. We can't just slip you an extra.
[03:01:33.020 --> 03:01:39.860]  I can't just bring you up for an extra if excuse me, if if they look at the books and
[03:01:39.860 --> 03:01:45.220]  see that I sold you over what your limit is, I can get in trouble.
[03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:46.660]  The whole shop can get in trouble.
[03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:47.780]  We can get shut down.
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:50.500]  They can just come in and say, OK, that's it.
[03:01:50.820 --> 03:01:55.940]  Shut down until until further notice, until we've gone through your books and seen what
[03:01:55.940 --> 03:01:57.820]  we like. You know, we've gone through everything.
[03:01:58.380 --> 03:01:59.940]  Right. And then that's it.
[03:01:59.940 --> 03:02:02.100]  No jobs, no nothing.
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:04.260]  No reason to grow.
[03:02:04.260 --> 03:02:05.260]  There's no store.
[03:02:05.300 --> 03:02:06.860]  Yep. So you know what I mean?
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:08.620]  Like, it's just I'd be done.
[03:02:08.620 --> 03:02:10.060]  My trimmer would be done.
[03:02:10.540 --> 03:02:12.620]  There's how many people at Green and Healthy at the store?
[03:02:12.620 --> 03:02:13.860]  There is four of us.
[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:15.380]  All four of you would be done.
[03:02:15.460 --> 03:02:19.540]  Well, it's it's not just the one location that it gets screwed up at.
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:21.220]  It's every license tied to it.
[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:27.660]  It's happened a couple of times in Colorado where a marijuana business with five or six
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:32.740]  different licenses, they had a couple of dispensaries, one or two grows and maybe a
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:35.300]  product manufacturing license somewhere doing hash.
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:41.340]  One specific license, one specific location had a couple of violations.
[03:02:42.300 --> 03:02:46.940]  Two weeks later, all seven licenses suspended indefinitely.
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:53.740]  Seven months later, when they finally get a hearing, their licenses are revoked and
[03:02:54.060 --> 03:02:55.660]  the whole business is closed.
[03:02:55.660 --> 03:02:57.260]  Millions of dollars gone.
[03:02:57.580 --> 03:02:59.140]  Dozens of people out of work.
[03:03:00.460 --> 03:03:04.420]  And you just wandered off the street from Texas.
[03:03:04.420 --> 03:03:05.620]  Why would I sell you over the limit?
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:10.940]  Well, why would I mean, it just doesn't make any sense why you're asking.
[03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:12.460]  It's confusing. Marisol will.
[03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:14.500]  Oh, allegedly.
[03:03:14.500 --> 03:03:15.620]  I'm just kidding. They will not.
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:16.700]  They probably won't. All right.
[03:03:16.700 --> 03:03:17.980]  Here's where I get to a segue.
[03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:22.380]  You kind of just set me up into a good segue for something that this is a line that Mike
[03:03:22.380 --> 03:03:27.700]  and I used to get to say to people at our dispensary that we had that we had that this
[03:03:27.820 --> 03:03:29.260]  where I first employed Mike is.
[03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:30.900]  We didn't put this one on the list of stuff.
[03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:32.620]  We didn't go over this. But I already know what he's going to say.
[03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:35.940]  Yeah, this was the greatest thing to say to people is there are no returns at a
[03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:38.860]  dispensary. If you buy a product, we legally cannot take it back from you.
[03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:40.900]  If you leave the store with that product, it is now yours.
[03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:43.580]  Please look at the product that you're going to buy before you purchase it.
[03:03:43.820 --> 03:03:45.500]  We'll show it to you. We'll fucking take it out of the package.
[03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:47.180]  You can't touch it until you purchase it.
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:50.420]  That's a rule in the store. You can't put your hands on it, but you can get real close
[03:03:50.420 --> 03:03:52.020]  and look at it. You can tell what it is.
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:54.100]  You can smell it. We don't do no bait and switch.
[03:03:54.140 --> 03:03:58.740]  There's none of that shit. You if you want this gram that you see, Lindsey will put the
[03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:01.300]  lid on that gram and you can't carry it to the counter.
[03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:04.980]  A badged employee actually has to carry that product to the cash register and ring it up.
[03:04:04.980 --> 03:04:07.220]  And until it's packaged and ready to go, they can't give it to you.
[03:04:07.220 --> 03:04:08.620]  But you'll get that gram.
[03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:10.580]  So just there are no returns.
[03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:12.020]  Make sure you like that shit before you leave.
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:14.660]  And then don't go home and complain on Facebook that you bought some shit that you
[03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:15.900]  didn't want. That's my advice.
[03:04:16.180 --> 03:04:17.500]  No returns at the dispensary.
[03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:19.140]  That leads me into this next part.
[03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:21.660]  There are no discounts at the dispensary either.
[03:04:21.780 --> 03:04:23.340]  If you know Hunt, good for you.
[03:04:23.380 --> 03:04:27.100]  If you know Rasta Jeff, sorry, we can't give you a discount because Rasta Jeff does not
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:28.260]  make the prices here at the store.
[03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:32.100]  The store prices are set by the owner of the store and they're held by the management.
[03:04:32.420 --> 03:04:33.820]  We can't fuck with that. That's how it goes.
[03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:36.340]  Here's the old line that somebody used to.
[03:04:36.540 --> 03:04:40.380]  Everybody used to love to tell Mike and I when we had the dispensary downtown.
[03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:43.540]  But the dispensary in the county will give me ounces for way cheaper than you.
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:44.860]  Yeah, it's cheaper over there.
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:47.860]  What's the deal? And it's like, dude, if that's really the price, why did you come here?
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:50.460]  That's what we always tell them. We'll go over there and get an ounce and get me one while
[03:04:50.460 --> 03:04:52.220]  you're there. I'll give you money if it's that cheap.
[03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:54.940]  And they just look at you like fuck because they were lying every time.
[03:04:54.980 --> 03:04:59.380]  We knew it. The one I get all the time now is my well, my cousin has ounces for this.
[03:04:59.420 --> 03:05:04.260]  And I'm like, well, if that's true, you're here for one of two reasons.
[03:05:04.340 --> 03:05:08.220]  A, he got sick of you for some reason and stopped answering your phone calls.
[03:05:08.700 --> 03:05:13.460]  Or B, you got sick of having one weed option and you came to a store that has 50.
[03:05:14.060 --> 03:05:16.220]  Um, you came here for a reason.
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:21.100]  That reason wasn't we had ounces for the same price as your cousin.
[03:05:21.220 --> 03:05:22.220]  As your cousins weed line tested.
[03:05:22.220 --> 03:05:24.980]  And thanks for incriminating your cousin, BT Dubs.
[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:26.700]  Yeah, just like, can we?
[03:05:27.420 --> 03:05:28.940]  Sloppy calls that dry snitchin.
[03:05:31.380 --> 03:05:32.980]  Shout out to my man Sloppy up on the mountain.
[03:05:32.980 --> 03:05:34.580]  I hope you listen to the podcast still, brother.
[03:05:34.580 --> 03:05:36.620]  Nothing but love. We can talk about it now.
[03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:38.220]  Congratulations on the little one, Sloppy.
[03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:40.020]  You've made it public. Congratulations.
[03:05:40.020 --> 03:05:41.260]  Much love on the little Sloppy.
[03:05:41.900 --> 03:05:43.260]  Little, little Sloppy Savannah.
[03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:45.140]  I'm so excited for Papa Slop.
[03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:46.940]  Did you guys not hear how tired I am?
[03:05:47.740 --> 03:05:50.620]  Well, like I'm just saying, we've been saying congratulations to a lot of people
[03:05:50.620 --> 03:05:53.300]  lately and I'm starting to think people don't understand how exhausted I am.
[03:05:53.380 --> 03:05:54.860]  Slop's a young kid and wants to fuck.
[03:05:54.900 --> 03:05:56.660]  So I mean, he done made him a baby.
[03:05:56.700 --> 03:05:57.500]  That's how it works.
[03:05:57.500 --> 03:05:58.500]  I got pills for that.
[03:05:58.500 --> 03:06:00.300]  You like to fuck as much as Sloppy does.
[03:06:00.460 --> 03:06:01.180]  You make some babies.
[03:06:01.180 --> 03:06:01.900]  Birth control.
[03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:04.980]  I don't know what I just wanted into.
[03:06:04.980 --> 03:06:05.500]  Sorry.
[03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:10.060]  Anyways, what's next on your list?
[03:06:10.060 --> 03:06:11.180]  Next on my list.
[03:06:11.380 --> 03:06:11.980]  No discounts.
[03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:14.980]  If you can get it, if you're going to tell me that it's cheaper over at that store,
[03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:16.380]  go to that fucking store and get it there.
[03:06:16.380 --> 03:06:17.500]  Don't tell me how cheap it is there.
[03:06:18.020 --> 03:06:21.020]  If you're cool and deserve it, if you don't ask for some discounts and there's a
[03:06:21.020 --> 03:06:24.020]  discount available, the butt tender will be kind enough to go, hey, you want a
[03:06:24.020 --> 03:06:27.460]  dickhead today is fucking titties Tuesday and you get the titties discount or
[03:06:27.460 --> 03:06:29.820]  whatever it happens to be and you'll get some deals.
[03:06:30.020 --> 03:06:31.020]  You don't have to beg for anything.
[03:06:31.020 --> 03:06:35.340]  We, they, they slash we will give all of the customers the appropriate discounts.
[03:06:36.540 --> 03:06:37.460]  Absolutely.
[03:06:37.540 --> 03:06:38.340]  Absolutely.
[03:06:38.540 --> 03:06:41.860]  I feel like I should add that there's no minimum purchase, like, because
[03:06:41.860 --> 03:06:44.980]  you made it into the butter room doesn't mean you have to buy something and act
[03:06:44.980 --> 03:06:46.540]  like I'm robbing you.
[03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:47.300]  That's true.
[03:06:47.300 --> 03:06:48.020]  You pay for it.
[03:06:48.100 --> 03:06:48.780]  That is very true.
[03:06:48.780 --> 03:06:49.180]  Say no.
[03:06:49.180 --> 03:06:49.780]  Thank you.
[03:06:49.900 --> 03:06:50.100]  Yeah.
[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:50.900]  Turn around and leave.
[03:06:50.940 --> 03:06:51.180]  Yep.
[03:06:51.340 --> 03:06:52.660]  Is that I do it.
[03:06:52.660 --> 03:06:55.260]  It's stores all the time that aren't even weed related.
[03:06:55.620 --> 03:07:00.740]  I walk in, I realized that I don't need to spend $85 on a t-shirt and I don't buy
[03:07:00.740 --> 03:07:00.900]  it.
[03:07:01.540 --> 03:07:06.820]  Um, I'm not rude when I do it and the customer or the employees there aren't
[03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:10.260]  offended when I do it, but every now and then I'll have somebody that comes in.
[03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:13.860]  Is shocked by the price of legal marijuana.
[03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:16.620]  I, I ask them what they want.
[03:07:16.620 --> 03:07:18.340]  They like, we'll go ahead and give me a gram of that.
[03:07:18.340 --> 03:07:21.460]  And when I ring them up, they act like I've grabbed them by the balls and I'm
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:23.140]  squeezing money out of their pocket.
[03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:25.300]  It's so bizarre.
[03:07:25.620 --> 03:07:31.100]  If you do have an experience at a dispensary, um, I gotta quit saying, um,
[03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:35.060]  when you have, if you have a shitty experience at a dispensary, whether it's
[03:07:35.060 --> 03:07:41.060]  recreational or retail, the first plan of attack is not to go to weed maps and
[03:07:41.060 --> 03:07:42.780]  Facebook and bash the place.
[03:07:43.180 --> 03:07:47.780]  You should go back, either call or go back and see if the problem can't be
[03:07:47.780 --> 03:07:51.660]  resolved in an adult manner before you go try to get crazy on the internet.
[03:07:51.660 --> 03:07:53.700]  Everyone's a keyboard commando and they're all fired up.
[03:07:54.100 --> 03:07:54.860]  Chill the fuck out.
[03:07:55.260 --> 03:07:56.020]  Just call the place.
[03:07:56.260 --> 03:07:57.060]  We're all adults.
[03:07:57.100 --> 03:07:58.340]  We want you to be happy.
[03:07:58.500 --> 03:08:00.660]  We've got, we want you to come back.
[03:08:00.740 --> 03:08:01.140]  You know what I mean?
[03:08:01.140 --> 03:08:02.540]  We've got a reputation to uphold.
[03:08:02.540 --> 03:08:03.860]  We've got a relationship with you.
[03:08:03.860 --> 03:08:04.860]  We want you coming back.
[03:08:04.860 --> 03:08:07.180]  We don't want to just take your money and forget about you.
[03:08:07.180 --> 03:08:08.220]  It's not what it's all about.
[03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:11.660]  So if you're not happy with it, don't, don't go bash the internet.
[03:08:11.700 --> 03:08:13.460]  Just try to contact the dispensary.
[03:08:13.940 --> 03:08:14.660]  Try to go back.
[03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:15.260]  If you can.
[03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:17.900]  I understand that a lot of you have traveled away if it's a recreational
[03:08:17.900 --> 03:08:21.340]  facility, but if it's a medical place, just come back, talk to us.
[03:08:21.380 --> 03:08:22.660]  We can't take your refund.
[03:08:22.660 --> 03:08:24.980]  We can't take your shit back, but maybe we can figure out
[03:08:24.980 --> 03:08:26.340]  something to make you happier.
[03:08:26.660 --> 03:08:29.900]  Maybe we can adjust things, but don't go to the internet and be a dick right away.
[03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:31.060]  Uh, it's a business.
[03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:32.660]  We will run a business.
[03:08:32.700 --> 03:08:34.100]  Most places run a business.
[03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:37.860]  If they are still around at this point in Colorado, they're probably
[03:08:37.860 --> 03:08:39.420]  doing their running business.
[03:08:40.420 --> 03:08:40.700]  All right.
[03:08:40.940 --> 03:08:44.020]  So I think that that pretty much, uh, I think that wraps up most of my, unless
[03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:47.060]  you guys got something you want to add to the weed etiquette part, then I've
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:49.620]  got another topic I kind of want to talk about for a couple of minutes.
[03:08:49.660 --> 03:08:50.420]  It won't take too long.
[03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:54.740]  Uh, a recent, uh, article up in Denver.
[03:08:54.820 --> 03:08:59.660]  Um, some news anchor went online, uh, online to plead with people
[03:08:59.660 --> 03:09:01.100]  to wear pants to the dispensary.
[03:09:01.660 --> 03:09:04.820]  Apparently he walks by one every day on his way to work or whatever.
[03:09:05.260 --> 03:09:07.540]  And there's always people walking in wearing boxers.
[03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:09.540]  I assume he means female people.
[03:09:10.140 --> 03:09:16.140]  Um, but, uh, I've had a couple of people show up and get, uh, there
[03:09:16.140 --> 03:09:18.020]  was the last one was also drunk.
[03:09:18.580 --> 03:09:23.660]  Um, but walk up barefoot, like in topless, um, to the door, like just
[03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:26.820]  a dude wearing some shorts, no shoes, no shirt, no nothing.
[03:09:27.420 --> 03:09:30.340]  And it's like, no, you're not getting in, bro.
[03:09:31.220 --> 03:09:33.780]  Um, and then they get offended when they can't get in.
[03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:37.140]  It's like, is there any store in America where you can just roll up?
[03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:40.220]  Barefoot and topless and shop at, that's not like an
[03:09:40.220 --> 03:09:41.700]  open air market at a beach.
[03:09:42.940 --> 03:09:43.060]  Yeah.
[03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:44.740]  Where we're choosing a shirt.
[03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:48.700]  Surprisingly, uh, there's a weird lack of common sense.
[03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:50.900]  Sometimes when it's the weeds, I don't know if it's people getting
[03:09:50.900 --> 03:09:55.180]  overexcited or people assuming that, uh, because we're the only place on
[03:09:55.180 --> 03:09:57.660]  the planet that really has weed stores like this, that none of the
[03:09:57.660 --> 03:10:03.900]  accidentally they blend drug dealer habit and trap house habit into the
[03:10:03.900 --> 03:10:08.420]  store experience because they just, in their mind, in your mind, going to buy
[03:10:08.420 --> 03:10:14.260]  weed was going to some white dude with dreadlocks his house and sitting on his
[03:10:14.260 --> 03:10:17.460]  couch and playing dreadlock playing fucking video games for 30 minutes.
[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:18.700]  I put the white guy with dreadlocks in there.
[03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:19.660]  Cause it used to be me.
[03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:20.660]  That's why, right.
[03:10:20.940 --> 03:10:22.500]  Uh, fucking showing up at my house.
[03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:25.020]  You just have to come to my house and I'd make you fucking play seven or
[03:10:25.020 --> 03:10:27.900]  eight rounds of black ops just so that you didn't look like we were doing
[03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:31.940]  business, have to come and listen to whatever new CD I bought and hang out.
[03:10:31.940 --> 03:10:32.260]  That's.
[03:10:32.540 --> 03:10:34.420]  And so you used to get into that mode.
[03:10:34.460 --> 03:10:36.260]  I'm going to go hang out with Jeff for 30 minutes.
[03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:39.460]  And so there's two episodes of how it's made and then head home.
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:41.980]  And they're thinking that that's going to happen and that you're their drug
[03:10:41.980 --> 03:10:45.140]  dealer now, as soon as they come into the dispensary, you've now become me
[03:10:45.260 --> 03:10:47.900]  for these guys in their mind, you're their surrogate weed dealer.
[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:51.780]  There's a little bit of that, but like, dude, a lot of people I bought weed
[03:10:51.780 --> 03:10:55.380]  from before, like if you showed up half drunk, barefoot, topless at their house,
[03:10:55.380 --> 03:11:00.100]  stumbling across from the street, uh, data screamed at you for 20 minutes before
[03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:01.700]  not selling you weed and sending you home.
[03:11:01.740 --> 03:11:02.740]  Depends on who you are.
[03:11:03.100 --> 03:11:06.460]  If you show up barefoot and topless here, there might be prizes.
[03:11:07.220 --> 03:11:10.700]  Um, this is like 340,000.
[03:11:10.700 --> 03:11:12.140]  Just give me the greatest look.
[03:11:16.420 --> 03:11:17.220]  Wow.
[03:11:17.660 --> 03:11:20.380]  This podcast has got so many strange places.
[03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:28.540]  Like tonight wasn't sure if I got props or if she was questioning my judgment or
[03:11:28.540 --> 03:11:31.340]  what was happening there, I think it was like, don't encourage them, Jeff.
[03:11:31.380 --> 03:11:31.860]  Don't don't.
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:34.100]  That's what I thought I'd read on her face.
[03:11:35.900 --> 03:11:36.900]  Barefoot naked.
[03:11:37.580 --> 03:11:38.660]  I might have prizes for it.
[03:11:38.660 --> 03:11:41.060]  Just because this dude was a prize of this dude.
[03:11:41.060 --> 03:11:41.580]  I'm not in.
[03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:42.260]  Yeah.
[03:11:42.620 --> 03:11:44.500]  If you've got a beard, this does not apply to you.
[03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:45.740]  Sloppy drunk.
[03:11:46.180 --> 03:11:49.340]  Uh, it's been a couple of, a little bit since we released the last episode
[03:11:49.340 --> 03:11:52.980]  and nobody has replied with the Walmart challenge yet or the mullet challenge.
[03:11:52.980 --> 03:11:56.300]  I think we might've lost some people by that point in the show.
[03:11:56.340 --> 03:11:56.620]  Yeah.
[03:11:56.980 --> 03:11:58.260]  No, most people listen all the way.
[03:11:58.580 --> 03:11:58.820]  All right.
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:01.460]  So what I want, I mean, I hinted that I wanted to talk about more stuff.
[03:12:01.820 --> 03:12:07.100]  Um, recently I've seen people discussing this and I wanted to just state my, my
[03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:08.900]  piece on it, uh, on Facebook.
[03:12:08.900 --> 03:12:13.500]  There's a thing going around about illegal cultivators, not wanting cannabis
[03:12:13.500 --> 03:12:16.220]  to be legalized because it's putting them out of business.
[03:12:17.220 --> 03:12:20.100]  Uh, fuck all that.
[03:12:20.180 --> 03:12:20.500]  Come on.
[03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:21.500]  Don't be a selfish bitch.
[03:12:21.500 --> 03:12:22.220]  This is cannabis.
[03:12:22.220 --> 03:12:26.140]  This should be something for everybody and you wanting it not legalized.
[03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:28.940]  Do you wanting by not wanting cannabis legalized?
[03:12:29.020 --> 03:12:32.340]  And most of my listeners are going to want cannabis legalized, but this is, I'm
[03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:34.220]  just kind of going off on my own roster.
[03:12:34.220 --> 03:12:37.820]  Jeff rent those people that are selling cannabis illegally and producing and
[03:12:37.820 --> 03:12:41.340]  hustling and flipping cannabis illegally that do not want cannabis legalized.
[03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:45.900]  The people you are selling that cannabis to are criminals and will go to
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:48.260]  jail if they are caught with the product you're selling them.
[03:12:48.500 --> 03:12:50.020]  And you seem to be supporting that.
[03:12:50.060 --> 03:12:50.860]  That's bullshit.
[03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:54.580]  You're putting your family, yourself, your customers, everyone in danger
[03:12:54.900 --> 03:12:57.500]  because you're greedy and you want to have a hustle.
[03:12:58.300 --> 03:13:02.340]  Uh, I can kind of be a little bit hypocritical sounding right now because
[03:13:02.340 --> 03:13:05.420]  I grow and produce cannabis, but I'm doing it fully legal for a
[03:13:05.420 --> 03:13:06.940]  fully regulated facility.
[03:13:07.140 --> 03:13:10.980]  I've got a legal legit job, which is possible when you legalize cannabis.
[03:13:10.980 --> 03:13:11.860]  I pay taxes.
[03:13:11.860 --> 03:13:12.900]  I have a time clock.
[03:13:13.300 --> 03:13:14.780]  I'm not looking over my shoulder.
[03:13:15.060 --> 03:13:18.260]  Is it don't want it legalized so that you can have your own hustle or kind of
[03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:21.860]  in stingy bitches and fucking it up for the rest of the country that wants
[03:13:21.860 --> 03:13:24.180]  legalized cannabis, help us support us out.
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:30.500]  Uh, what if you helped us legalize it and got into the industry and used your
[03:13:30.500 --> 03:13:34.860]  hustler skills to good use and actually put some tax money in and actually got
[03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:38.180]  a 401k and actually had some benefits and had something that you could talk
[03:13:38.180 --> 03:13:43.380]  about to your family, do what you want to do all day and not have to risk
[03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:44.780]  everything you have to do it.
[03:13:45.060 --> 03:13:45.340]  Yeah.
[03:13:45.540 --> 03:13:47.140]  Being a drug dealer is only one skill.
[03:13:47.140 --> 03:13:47.820]  You're a drug dealer.
[03:13:47.820 --> 03:13:49.460]  You can't put that on a resume anywhere.
[03:13:51.140 --> 03:13:52.500]  It can't, you can only do that for so long.
[03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:55.780]  I think the days of the big trap house grows and the people throwing
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:13:57.580]  out mad pounds and flipping packs.
[03:13:58.300 --> 03:14:00.700]  Uh, that that's going away in Colorado.
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:03.060]  It is going away so fast.
[03:14:03.500 --> 03:14:05.860]  Pueblo is, is raining in hard.
[03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:10.060]  Other cities are also raining in very hard.
[03:14:10.100 --> 03:14:16.060]  Like, and the thing that caught me, um, about all the recent news is that it's
[03:14:16.060 --> 03:14:20.860]  all headed to Florida in Texas and places far from legalization.
[03:14:21.460 --> 03:14:22.860]  Um, because here.
[03:14:23.420 --> 03:14:26.180]  The black market price of the pound doesn't make it worth the effort.
[03:14:26.540 --> 03:14:26.980]  Truth.
[03:14:27.220 --> 03:14:29.660]  Um, it's just not worth the effort and risk anymore.
[03:14:29.660 --> 03:14:34.220]  There's not enough profit margin in between what it takes to produce it and
[03:14:34.220 --> 03:14:37.980]  distribute it in the profit you get back from doing that, just to pay a trimmer
[03:14:38.020 --> 03:14:41.180]  and your electricity, you're breaking even nowadays at the cost of cannabis.
[03:14:41.700 --> 03:14:45.300]  If you want to make a profit on it, you've got to drive it far, far away.
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:46.740]  I have a lot of lights.
[03:14:46.820 --> 03:14:49.140]  I have a lot of lights and I run two of them.
[03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:49.700]  Yeah.
[03:14:49.700 --> 03:14:52.980]  And if that's scary, because you're currently involved in the illegal side
[03:14:52.980 --> 03:14:55.220]  of things and you don't think there's going to be a place for you in
[03:14:55.220 --> 03:15:00.460]  legalization, wise up, get involved with the legalization effort in your area and
[03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:02.820]  make sure that those efforts carve out a place for you.
[03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:08.580]  Um, I think one of the ways Colorado really fucked up is we didn't, we didn't
[03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:15.460]  make, um, uh, I'm trying to get my life in order badge for employees.
[03:15:15.900 --> 03:15:20.500]  Like if you have previous felonies and stuff like that, like there's no
[03:15:20.500 --> 03:15:22.340]  reason you can't be a trimmer somewhere.
[03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:26.580]  There's no reason you can't be working in like a trustee, like a trustee, MED
[03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:31.940]  badge, I don't know, something like, like a support and a half badge or something.
[03:15:31.940 --> 03:15:36.060]  I don't, I don't know what they would call it, but like, um, I read articles
[03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:40.500]  all the time of people that like have had, have been involved in the black
[03:15:40.500 --> 03:15:46.300]  market for cannabis for years in around the country, picked up a couple of
[03:15:46.300 --> 03:15:48.340]  charges along the way because of that.
[03:15:48.900 --> 03:15:53.060]  Um, they hop in the car, they kind of abandoned what little they had built up
[03:15:53.060 --> 03:15:57.940]  for a life, wherever they were come here, hoping to get into the industry and
[03:15:57.940 --> 03:16:02.060]  realized that we shut the door on all those people right at the beginning of
[03:16:02.060 --> 03:16:07.060]  regulation, um, right off the bat, we said no felonies in five years, no drug
[03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:08.500]  felonies in 10 and a story.
[03:16:09.220 --> 03:16:12.660]  Um, and that locked out a huge portion of people that have been
[03:16:12.660 --> 03:16:13.900]  involved in the black market.
[03:16:14.620 --> 03:16:17.580]  Um, and I think a lot of those people that are trying to get their shit
[03:16:17.580 --> 03:16:20.260]  together should have a way to work in the legal industry.
[03:16:20.700 --> 03:16:23.020]  It's something other than the local head shop.
[03:16:23.220 --> 03:16:26.340]  Have you seen what happens when one of those persons that was banned for like
[03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:29.460]  10 years, when their day comes up and they're allowed to get their badge and
[03:16:29.460 --> 03:16:31.540]  you see them fucking jump full force into the industry.
[03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:32.220]  Have you seen that?
[03:16:32.420 --> 03:16:33.020]  A little bit.
[03:16:33.100 --> 03:16:36.220]  I probably pay more attention because I'm more into the industry side of things in
[03:16:36.220 --> 03:16:36.580]  the scene.
[03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:39.580]  I pay attention to the breeders and the people who are into that part, but I've
[03:16:39.580 --> 03:16:42.260]  seen a car, I won't say their names because I don't know if that's polite to
[03:16:42.380 --> 03:16:45.780]  call people out who just got off a 10 year thing, but I know what a lot of
[03:16:45.780 --> 03:16:47.940]  people have had to wait and you can see them.
[03:16:47.980 --> 03:16:51.060]  They were like at the fucking starting line and someone pulled that trigger, bang,
[03:16:51.060 --> 03:16:51.660]  you can go.
[03:16:51.660 --> 03:16:53.300]  And a couple of these people just left.
[03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:54.060]  I see one seat.
[03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:55.220]  Already had the application.
[03:16:55.220 --> 03:16:55.740]  Ready to go.
[03:16:55.740 --> 03:17:00.180]  The day of seeds packaged, like seeds packaged and everything was ready to go
[03:17:00.180 --> 03:17:01.580]  and they were just ready to do it.
[03:17:01.580 --> 03:17:02.060]  You know what I mean?
[03:17:02.060 --> 03:17:06.860]  Like they were already behind the scenes with some dispensary or telling somebody
[03:17:06.860 --> 03:17:08.620]  what to do, you know, guiding them.
[03:17:08.620 --> 03:17:10.300]  And then all they had to do was say, this guy's here.
[03:17:10.300 --> 03:17:11.180]  We've got his brand.
[03:17:11.180 --> 03:17:11.980]  This is happening.
[03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:14.460]  And it just went fucking apeshit when that happened.
[03:17:14.740 --> 03:17:20.620]  So maybe Colorado should make like a cannabis council that you can appeal.
[03:17:21.460 --> 03:17:24.420]  You'll want to honestly, I honestly have no idea what we're going to do with the
[03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:26.940]  rules are changing in really weird ways right now.
[03:17:27.580 --> 03:17:32.340]  Um, cause in a, in a very real way, we're inventing this shit as we go.
[03:17:32.980 --> 03:17:40.460]  Um, there's no, um, like in the last month we banned a whole bunch of edibles.
[03:17:40.540 --> 03:17:42.220]  Um, they can't be certain shapes now.
[03:17:42.860 --> 03:17:47.740]  Um, and we let tourists buy four times what they were currently allowed to buy.
[03:17:48.340 --> 03:17:51.820]  Um, and those two changes are in direct opposition of each other.
[03:17:52.500 --> 03:17:55.460]  Um, but are happening at the same time.
[03:17:55.940 --> 03:17:57.580]  It's very, very strange.
[03:17:57.580 --> 03:18:01.140]  The first couple of shops to really get busted for violations are all
[03:18:01.140 --> 03:18:02.740]  going through their hearings.
[03:18:02.780 --> 03:18:05.140]  That process is being invented right now.
[03:18:05.900 --> 03:18:08.620]  Um, and this is going to keep going on for at least five years.
[03:18:09.420 --> 03:18:11.780]  Uh, it's a very fun time to live right here in Puebla.
[03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:16.220]  Uh, we just founded a marijuana research Institute here.
[03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:16.820]  Yes.
[03:18:16.900 --> 03:18:23.300]  Um, $1.2 million in marijuana taxes going to our local university, like 900 from
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:25.940]  the state, 250 from our local County.
[03:18:26.380 --> 03:18:26.540]  Yeah.
[03:18:26.540 --> 03:18:29.380]  It's going to Colorado state university here in Puebla, right?
[03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:29.740]  Yep.
[03:18:29.900 --> 03:18:32.060]  Uh, CSU P is it's known locally.
[03:18:32.180 --> 03:18:36.380]  Um, they're going to be doing medical research and social research.
[03:18:36.740 --> 03:18:40.580]  So we'll finally start getting some hard data, um, as to what happens when you
[03:18:40.580 --> 03:18:43.020]  legalize marijuana for all adults in the community.
[03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:46.260]  Um, lots of cool research taking place down here.
[03:18:47.140 --> 03:18:50.820]  I don't know where that came from, but yeah, I like it when you ramble.
[03:18:50.900 --> 03:18:51.300]  Yeah.
[03:18:52.980 --> 03:18:56.100]  We went from talking about illegal growers to, uh, the.
[03:18:56.980 --> 03:18:59.460]  University testing and doing studies.
[03:18:59.460 --> 03:19:03.980]  Just cooler by whoever Lindsey bought that from was, I don't
[03:19:03.980 --> 03:19:05.020]  know which company made that.
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:07.500]  Dope X that was done by her.
[03:19:07.500 --> 03:19:08.340]  And that was from us.
[03:19:08.980 --> 03:19:12.060]  That's what I thought, but I didn't want to say that cactus
[03:19:12.060 --> 03:19:13.620]  cooler cut is kind of exclusive.
[03:19:13.700 --> 03:19:17.540]  I was given a cut of that cactus cooler and I was told don't let that out because
[03:19:17.540 --> 03:19:19.140]  of this is the only place that has it.
[03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:21.500]  And if it's ever seen out on the streets, we know you let it out.
[03:19:21.980 --> 03:19:22.620]  So I've got it.
[03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:24.380]  My personal growth will never go anywhere.
[03:19:24.460 --> 03:19:25.940]  It will get pollinated with shit.
[03:19:25.940 --> 03:19:27.660]  How long ago did I take that dab people?
[03:19:27.660 --> 03:19:28.620]  I can still taste it.
[03:19:28.620 --> 03:19:29.380]  It's yeah.
[03:19:29.620 --> 03:19:29.980]  Yeah.
[03:19:30.020 --> 03:19:32.860]  Uh, I would like to take a lot of credit for that girl, but honestly, you could
[03:19:32.860 --> 03:19:35.620]  grow that string with dog poop and it'll come out tasting delicious.
[03:19:35.660 --> 03:19:36.140]  Real strong.
[03:19:36.740 --> 03:19:37.140]  It's yeah.
[03:19:37.140 --> 03:19:39.140]  It's super flavorful, super turpy.
[03:19:39.500 --> 03:19:41.100]  Uh, shout out to the cactus cooler strain.
[03:19:41.100 --> 03:19:42.380]  I'm not sure where that one came from.
[03:19:43.100 --> 03:19:45.020]  I have an idea, but I don't want to be wrong.
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:49.580]  If you know, email the show at it's growing from your heart at hotmail.com.
[03:19:50.140 --> 03:19:55.620]  Uh, we know, uh, Hunt knows who, no, I'm sure I was just, it gave me the
[03:19:55.620 --> 03:19:58.860]  layup, so I threw it to you, but I, it was grown by myself at green and healthy
[03:19:58.860 --> 03:20:01.780]  trim by our buddy, John Randall's junior shout out Randall's.
[03:20:01.780 --> 03:20:03.020]  I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[03:20:03.020 --> 03:20:04.020]  In fact, I know you're listening.
[03:20:04.020 --> 03:20:04.820]  Happy Monday, brother.
[03:20:05.100 --> 03:20:05.780]  I hope you're back with me.
[03:20:06.540 --> 03:20:08.220]  Uh, if it's Monday, you're probably back with me.
[03:20:08.220 --> 03:20:09.220]  If not, you will be Tuesday.
[03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:12.620]  I was trimmed by Randall's and then it was extracted by our friends at Turpex.
[03:20:12.620 --> 03:20:14.300]  I'm not sure which one of the turpy boys ran it.
[03:20:14.300 --> 03:20:16.980]  Either Shane, probably Shane, maybe Logan.
[03:20:17.380 --> 03:20:18.660]  Really nice job.
[03:20:18.740 --> 03:20:18.940]  Yeah.
[03:20:18.940 --> 03:20:20.340]  Well, they do, they do pretty good.
[03:20:20.340 --> 03:20:21.580]  I love that Shane.
[03:20:21.740 --> 03:20:26.100]  Um, not just the boys at TURP, but the, it was grown well, it was
[03:20:26.100 --> 03:20:28.100]  trimmed well, and it was extracted.
[03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:29.180]  Well, well, thank you.
[03:20:29.380 --> 03:20:29.740]  Thank you.
[03:20:29.740 --> 03:20:30.180]  Thank you.
[03:20:30.300 --> 03:20:31.780]  And it made it into the dab rig.
[03:20:31.780 --> 03:20:34.460]  Well, getting the system figured out over there, green and healthy wellness.
[03:20:34.460 --> 03:20:38.540]  They have a nice gross setup and it took me, I think this is like, started
[03:20:38.540 --> 03:20:40.820]  pulling like the third harvest out of there, the first harvest.
[03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:42.660]  I didn't have full control of the second harvest.
[03:20:42.660 --> 03:20:43.860]  I didn't cut the clones.
[03:20:43.860 --> 03:20:45.820]  So they were a little overgrown by the time I got to it.
[03:20:45.820 --> 03:20:47.780]  Now we're in clones that I cut myself.
[03:20:48.500 --> 03:20:50.980]  Uh, and we're about to harvest all of that stuff pretty soon here.
[03:20:51.020 --> 03:20:52.980]  Johnny, you'll be there trimming it down Monday.
[03:20:53.540 --> 03:20:54.940]  Uh, I'm starting to get it figured out.
[03:20:54.940 --> 03:20:55.620]  I really like it.
[03:20:55.620 --> 03:20:56.780]  We've switched nutrients.
[03:20:57.220 --> 03:20:59.540]  Uh, we were using, it was proprietary.
[03:20:59.540 --> 03:21:02.220]  I wasn't allowed to say before, but since we switched, we were using a
[03:21:02.220 --> 03:21:06.540]  brand called MB Fertz, which they send us just powders, and then we would
[03:21:06.540 --> 03:21:08.140]  make the nutrients with the water.
[03:21:08.140 --> 03:21:12.020]  We'd fucking, uh, reconstitute.
[03:21:12.220 --> 03:21:12.540]  What's that?
[03:21:12.540 --> 03:21:12.740]  Yeah.
[03:21:12.740 --> 03:21:13.940]  It's a concentrate.
[03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:16.660]  They'd send us concentrate and then we'd fucking dilute it, I guess, is
[03:21:16.660 --> 03:21:18.180]  what we were doing with hot water.
[03:21:18.580 --> 03:21:21.740]  Now we're using a veg bloom, the entire veg bloom line with a couple
[03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:26.060]  of other things mixed in, and I can see a huge difference from the veg bloom line.
[03:21:26.060 --> 03:21:27.660]  Those plants are beasting out.
[03:21:27.660 --> 03:21:29.460]  They're like a week ahead of the other plants.
[03:21:29.460 --> 03:21:30.980]  They look way fucking awesome.
[03:21:31.220 --> 03:21:31.620]  That's funny.
[03:21:31.620 --> 03:21:33.700]  I was going to ask you that, but I didn't know if you wanted to like
[03:21:34.020 --> 03:21:35.380]  talk about that on the podcast.
[03:21:35.420 --> 03:21:35.660]  Yeah.
[03:21:36.580 --> 03:21:39.500]  I kind of go by what Hunt says, what I can share and what I can't share.
[03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:43.900]  And since veg bloom helped us out quite a bit, I'm all about giving veg bloom a
[03:21:43.900 --> 03:21:45.940]  shout out, plus I see huge results.
[03:21:45.940 --> 03:21:50.060]  I can already see there are three different sections of plants.
[03:21:50.060 --> 03:21:53.540]  So we're like week four and then about week six, and then there's
[03:21:53.540 --> 03:21:57.580]  another one that's fresh, but I can see looking at the veg bloom versus the MB
[03:21:57.580 --> 03:21:59.940]  Fertz, the MB Fertz plants are almost ready to get cut.
[03:22:00.220 --> 03:22:03.460]  The veg bloom plants are in week four and the buds are already as big as the
[03:22:03.460 --> 03:22:05.260]  final product on the MB Fertz table.
[03:22:05.460 --> 03:22:05.620]  Wow.
[03:22:05.620 --> 03:22:06.980]  So veg bloom is killing it.
[03:22:07.020 --> 03:22:07.340]  Yeah.
[03:22:07.900 --> 03:22:09.140]  Definitely crushing it.
[03:22:09.620 --> 03:22:09.860]  Cool.
[03:22:09.940 --> 03:22:11.020]  It's easy to mix.
[03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:14.500]  They send you just bags of powder.
[03:22:14.500 --> 03:22:17.900]  Basically, it looks like you just got a bunch of cocaine delivered and then you
[03:22:17.900 --> 03:22:19.860]  weigh it, it goes by weight per gallon.
[03:22:19.860 --> 03:22:26.500]  And so I weigh out approximately, I think it's about 700 grams of the, each base.
[03:22:26.500 --> 03:22:29.260]  I've got two different bases, a hard water and a soft water because our
[03:22:29.260 --> 03:22:30.300]  water is a certain condition.
[03:22:30.300 --> 03:22:32.420]  We mix them for the ideal results.
[03:22:32.900 --> 03:22:35.540]  I weigh out certain amounts on a scale and then just drop it in the water
[03:22:35.540 --> 03:22:37.900]  and give it a good stir and it dissolves really quickly.
[03:22:37.900 --> 03:22:39.940]  It doesn't chunk up my filters too badly.
[03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:42.020]  It doesn't clog up my sprinkler system.
[03:22:42.020 --> 03:22:43.780]  So yeah, it seems to be working for what I'm doing.
[03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:44.260]  I like it.
[03:22:44.740 --> 03:22:45.060]  Nice.
[03:22:45.100 --> 03:22:45.300]  Yeah.
[03:22:45.620 --> 03:22:47.740]  I guess they just got a huge free fucking commercial from me.
[03:22:47.740 --> 03:22:48.140]  Didn't they?
[03:22:48.780 --> 03:22:49.900]  Shout out to our friends at Veg Bloom.
[03:22:49.900 --> 03:22:52.660]  I like that random giggle was, I was like, wow, shout out to Veg Bloom.
[03:22:52.740 --> 03:22:53.660]  No, I like the product.
[03:22:53.660 --> 03:22:54.220]  I would use it.
[03:22:54.220 --> 03:22:54.820]  I'd recommend it.
[03:22:54.820 --> 03:22:55.540]  It's simple to use.
[03:22:55.540 --> 03:22:56.380]  There are four products.
[03:22:56.380 --> 03:23:01.020]  There's a base, actually I have a foliar product that I fucking hugely recommend.
[03:23:01.060 --> 03:23:02.420]  The push, I think it is.
[03:23:03.100 --> 03:23:06.820]  They got a base, they've got shine, they've got life and they've got push.
[03:23:07.180 --> 03:23:07.860]  That's all you need.
[03:23:08.140 --> 03:23:11.220]  Those things will make your plant super happy and it's silly proof.
[03:23:11.260 --> 03:23:12.100]  You can't fuck it up.
[03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:15.060]  You can overdo it, but it's silly proof other than that.
[03:23:16.100 --> 03:23:16.540]  I love it.
[03:23:16.660 --> 03:23:16.900]  Yep.
[03:23:17.100 --> 03:23:19.540]  We're going to pull our best harvest ever here pretty soon at Green and Healthy.
[03:23:19.540 --> 03:23:20.820]  I'm super stoked.
[03:23:20.860 --> 03:23:21.580]  Yeah, I bet you are.
[03:23:21.580 --> 03:23:22.300]  Cause you get to sell it.
[03:23:23.980 --> 03:23:26.060]  I am cause I get to consume some of it.
[03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:27.220]  Yes, you do buddy.
[03:23:27.380 --> 03:23:30.620]  I was about to say smoke, but that, that really doesn't paint the full picture.
[03:23:30.740 --> 03:23:31.100]  Does it?
[03:23:32.620 --> 03:23:33.380]  You get to dab it.
[03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:34.180]  You get to smoke it.
[03:23:34.220 --> 03:23:34.980]  You get to smell it.
[03:23:37.900 --> 03:23:38.300]  All right.
[03:23:38.340 --> 03:23:39.620]  That was an awkward giggle there.
[03:23:41.700 --> 03:23:43.820]  I think Lindsay's needs a dab.
[03:23:43.940 --> 03:23:44.340]  Yeah.
[03:23:44.380 --> 03:23:45.460]  I just reached for it.
[03:23:45.460 --> 03:23:46.860]  As you said that, that was nice.
[03:23:46.940 --> 03:23:49.220]  Lindsay came over and rolled up a big old fat blunt and smoked that
[03:23:49.220 --> 03:23:51.060]  blunt to her face by herself.
[03:23:51.100 --> 03:23:51.420]  Wow.
[03:23:51.420 --> 03:23:52.900]  That is not even fair.
[03:23:52.980 --> 03:23:54.100]  I offered it.
[03:23:55.780 --> 03:24:00.540]  I was like, I know we jokingly told Mike that I like face the blunt.
[03:24:00.540 --> 03:24:04.220]  In front of you, I was like, but we're not going to let people think that I was
[03:24:04.220 --> 03:24:06.500]  that rude that I just came over here.
[03:24:06.500 --> 03:24:08.940]  I'm not into your flavored blunt wraps, dude.
[03:24:09.180 --> 03:24:09.980]  No offense to you.
[03:24:09.980 --> 03:24:10.580]  Oh yeah.
[03:24:10.580 --> 03:24:11.100]  It's those.
[03:24:11.300 --> 03:24:12.260]  No, I, you know what?
[03:24:12.260 --> 03:24:13.180]  I didn't even think about that.
[03:24:13.180 --> 03:24:15.020]  I forgot you didn't like them the last time.
[03:24:15.020 --> 03:24:15.900]  I would have brought different ones.
[03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:17.620]  I don't like to smoke a blunt period.
[03:24:17.620 --> 03:24:17.780]  Yeah.
[03:24:17.780 --> 03:24:19.580]  Well, I knew you weren't going to smoke one anyways.
[03:24:19.580 --> 03:24:21.380]  You wrap incense around it and I'm not into it.
[03:24:23.740 --> 03:24:24.540]  It's what it tastes like to me.
[03:24:24.540 --> 03:24:25.780]  It tastes like strawberry incense.
[03:24:26.340 --> 03:24:27.380]  I can't, I can't deal with it.
[03:24:27.660 --> 03:24:28.100]  That's funny.
[03:24:28.100 --> 03:24:32.740]  I, uh, I had this epiphany the other day that, cause I don't smoke cigarettes at
[03:24:32.740 --> 03:24:36.620]  all. I've never smoked cigarettes in my life, but I had this epiphany the other
[03:24:36.620 --> 03:24:41.660]  day that I'm actually addicted to nicotine because I smoke blunts.
[03:24:42.060 --> 03:24:45.220]  Actually, since I've been in Colorado, I smoke a lot less blunts.
[03:24:45.260 --> 03:24:50.900]  I smoke a lot more hash now that I'm out here, um, because I have access to great
[03:24:50.900 --> 03:24:51.460]  hash.
[03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:56.620]  So I, you know, I'm not going to dab poop soup in Florida.
[03:24:56.620 --> 03:24:58.020]  Shout out to poop soup in Florida.
[03:24:58.420 --> 03:25:00.420]  Um, you know who you are.
[03:25:00.740 --> 03:25:02.380]  Um, but, uh, yeah.
[03:25:02.940 --> 03:25:03.660]  So, yeah.
[03:25:03.660 --> 03:25:06.660]  So I like, you know, now that I'm here, I smoke a lot more hash, but I realized the
[03:25:06.660 --> 03:25:10.620]  other day that I might actually need to cut blunts out completely, which might
[03:25:10.780 --> 03:25:11.740]  really hurt me.
[03:25:11.740 --> 03:25:13.820]  You've been coughing quite a bit when you smoke a blunt.
[03:25:13.860 --> 03:25:14.460]  Yeah.
[03:25:14.540 --> 03:25:15.540]  It's been insane.
[03:25:15.540 --> 03:25:20.220]  So I'm just like, maybe I might have to actually stop smoking blunts for a while.
[03:25:20.220 --> 03:25:21.580]  So I like the dabs.
[03:25:21.580 --> 03:25:22.860]  They're just more economical.
[03:25:22.860 --> 03:25:25.380]  It's more, just less puffs on my lungs.
[03:25:25.740 --> 03:25:29.620]  Like, I feel like as a human, you probably get a set of tires.
[03:25:29.620 --> 03:25:32.420]  You get so many miles on your lungs, probably get so many ins and outs.
[03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:38.300]  And I feel like if I take 37, I was just talking to you, I've been staring right
[03:25:38.300 --> 03:25:39.900]  at her, having a conversation with her for a minute.
[03:25:39.900 --> 03:25:42.100]  I thought I agree with all of this.
[03:25:42.140 --> 03:25:44.900]  Um, I've been doing a lot of bonkheads lately.
[03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:48.180]  I was thinking I've been thinking about this though, cause it is a little more
[03:25:48.180 --> 03:25:49.180]  expensive that way.
[03:25:49.820 --> 03:25:52.580]  Um, and it definitely eats up a lot more time.
[03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:53.500]  Yeah.
[03:25:53.500 --> 03:25:59.700]  Like imagine I consume a lot of hash and imagine how much hash, how much flour I
[03:25:59.700 --> 03:26:03.020]  would have to consume to reach that level that I get with smoking.
[03:26:03.380 --> 03:26:06.900]  I can honestly smoke a half a gram to a gram of hash just in one sitting while
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:07.780]  we're just chilling out.
[03:26:07.860 --> 03:26:11.740]  There's a bunch of conversations about potency taking place around the country
[03:26:11.740 --> 03:26:12.140]  right now.
[03:26:12.140 --> 03:26:18.500]  And that's part of it's, it's missing is the stuff that's 75, 85% THC that we have
[03:26:18.500 --> 03:26:20.260]  available to us here in Colorado.
[03:26:20.900 --> 03:26:23.580]  Uh, we're not smoking a two gram blunt of it.
[03:26:24.820 --> 03:26:28.500]  Um, uh, now that I say that out loud, it sounds kind of fun.
[03:26:29.060 --> 03:26:32.140]  Um, but, uh, we're taking a tiny little dab.
[03:26:32.540 --> 03:26:34.380]  Uh, you're blabbing.
[03:26:34.380 --> 03:26:35.340]  Point two of a gram.
[03:26:35.340 --> 03:26:35.860]  I missed it.
[03:26:35.900 --> 03:26:37.900]  About the average size of a dab around here.
[03:26:40.780 --> 03:26:41.340]  Yeah.
[03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:43.900]  It's so much smaller, so much quicker.
[03:26:47.140 --> 03:26:47.820]  I'm going to take one.
[03:26:48.340 --> 03:26:50.860]  I was going to say we all been taking dabs on this show.
[03:26:50.860 --> 03:26:51.900]  Just went super silent.
[03:26:51.900 --> 03:26:53.900]  So maybe it's time to start wrapping up the show.
[03:26:53.900 --> 03:26:56.140]  You guys, maybe you can just wrap it up real quick and then I'll take a fat dab.
[03:26:57.740 --> 03:26:58.060]  Yeah.
[03:26:58.100 --> 03:26:58.340]  All right.
[03:26:58.340 --> 03:27:00.340]  You guys got any final words?
[03:27:01.780 --> 03:27:03.100]  Thanks for listening to everybody.
[03:27:03.100 --> 03:27:04.100]  This show is kind of bizarre.
[03:27:04.100 --> 03:27:04.820]  I think I like it.
[03:27:05.060 --> 03:27:05.420]  Yeah.
[03:27:05.420 --> 03:27:09.220]  Just, you know, when you come into dispensary, you just know what you're allowed
[03:27:09.220 --> 03:27:11.140]  to have, know what you're allowed to get.
[03:27:11.180 --> 03:27:16.380]  Um, you know, whether it's medical or recreational, you know, your limits,
[03:27:16.660 --> 03:27:20.780]  know what you're allowed to do as a patient and as a member, um, on the
[03:27:20.780 --> 03:27:24.340]  medical side, you know, don't come in and ask stupid questions.
[03:27:24.340 --> 03:27:27.820]  Don't say illegal things you're going to do, you know, the whole spiel from this
[03:27:27.820 --> 03:27:31.900]  time, but just really be conscious of yourself and the way you're portraying
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:35.740]  yourself and, um, yeah, all of that.
[03:27:35.740 --> 03:27:38.500]  Just be more conscious of yourselves in the dispensary.
[03:27:38.500 --> 03:27:38.980]  These guys,
[03:27:38.980 --> 03:27:40.180]  the dab just hit you, didn't it?
[03:27:40.220 --> 03:27:40.540]  Yeah.
[03:27:40.540 --> 03:27:43.060]  Cause I was just like, I could go, I could make this even longer.
[03:27:43.060 --> 03:27:44.260]  So I was like, I just need to stop.
[03:27:44.340 --> 03:27:45.300]  I was just impressed.
[03:27:45.300 --> 03:27:46.300]  We got a coherent wrap.
[03:27:47.300 --> 03:27:47.820]  I like it.
[03:27:48.340 --> 03:27:50.580]  Like a Jerry Springer's final thoughts is awesome.
[03:27:54.700 --> 03:27:55.300]  Oh gosh.
[03:27:55.300 --> 03:27:56.260]  I can't believe I've been with her.
[03:27:56.300 --> 03:27:57.380]  All right, guys, it's that time.
[03:27:57.620 --> 03:27:59.780]  Uh, the podcast is wrapping up, so it would be awesome.
[03:27:59.780 --> 03:28:02.140]  If you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search for the
[03:28:02.140 --> 03:28:03.300]  grow from your heart podcast.
[03:28:04.300 --> 03:28:06.300]  By the review section, type in a comment, let me know what you think
[03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:07.580]  about the podcast and guess what?
[03:28:07.580 --> 03:28:09.660]  I will read your comments on a future episode.
[03:28:09.660 --> 03:28:11.820]  There are probably a couple of hanging out there that I need to read soon.
[03:28:11.820 --> 03:28:12.460]  I will get to those.
[03:28:12.460 --> 03:28:13.140]  I promise you.
[03:28:13.540 --> 03:28:16.340]  Uh, when you're typing in a comment, uh, click on some stars.
[03:28:16.340 --> 03:28:17.100]  Let me know what you think.
[03:28:17.100 --> 03:28:18.500]  I can get one to five stars.
[03:28:19.060 --> 03:28:21.420]  Be honest, click on as many as you think I deserve.
[03:28:21.700 --> 03:28:24.100]  I'm not going to pander for five, but you know, that's always what we want.
[03:28:24.100 --> 03:28:25.700]  Keep us up to a solid five star rating.
[03:28:25.700 --> 03:28:26.220]  That'd be cool.
[03:28:26.780 --> 03:28:30.260]  Uh, what else can you do if you want to sponsor the show or if you've got a
[03:28:30.260 --> 03:28:33.420]  product you'd like to send me to review, if you send us a product, I
[03:28:33.420 --> 03:28:34.540]  will get the product in the mail.
[03:28:34.540 --> 03:28:35.500]  We will unbox it.
[03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:36.380]  I'll turn on the microphones.
[03:28:36.380 --> 03:28:38.700]  We won't do the whole podcast spiel, but I'll turn on the microphones.
[03:28:38.700 --> 03:28:39.420]  We'll sit at the table.
[03:28:39.420 --> 03:28:40.340]  Whoever's here with me.
[03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:41.820]  Oftentimes it's Mike.
[03:28:42.020 --> 03:28:43.180]  We'll unwrap a product.
[03:28:43.540 --> 03:28:44.980]  We'll talk about it as we unwrap it.
[03:28:44.980 --> 03:28:47.420]  We'll talk about how well it was packaged, what the packaging looks
[03:28:47.420 --> 03:28:48.940]  like, how appealing the packaging is.
[03:28:49.300 --> 03:28:51.740]  Uh, we will take the package out of the product, out of the package.
[03:28:52.100 --> 03:28:53.260]  Uh, we'll read the instructions.
[03:28:53.260 --> 03:28:54.540]  We can figure out how to use the thing.
[03:28:54.820 --> 03:28:55.700]  We'll get it charged up.
[03:28:55.700 --> 03:28:56.900]  If we need to, we'll press pause.
[03:28:56.900 --> 03:28:58.020]  We'll go smoke on our own.
[03:28:58.260 --> 03:28:59.820]  Once the thing's charged up, we'll come back.
[03:29:00.100 --> 03:29:03.060]  We'll use the device, whatever kind of toy you send us, whatever you'd like
[03:29:03.060 --> 03:29:04.580]  reviewed, but something to smoke.
[03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:06.340]  It's got a charger.
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:07.540]  Well, I mean, you know, vaping,
[03:29:07.540 --> 03:29:09.220]  that's what I liked about the furniture table.
[03:29:09.220 --> 03:29:10.220]  That was plug and play.
[03:29:11.020 --> 03:29:13.860]  The furniture table was a five-star review all the way around.
[03:29:13.900 --> 03:29:14.900]  That thing's amazing.
[03:29:14.980 --> 03:29:16.900]  Shout out to Chris Bobo.
[03:29:16.980 --> 03:29:17.340]  Yeah.
[03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:18.740]  Uh, Chris, come home soon, bro.
[03:29:18.740 --> 03:29:19.140]  We miss you.
[03:29:19.180 --> 03:29:19.820]  Yes.

[03:29:23.420 --> 03:29:24.740]  Um, we'll send it to us.
[03:29:24.740 --> 03:29:25.740]  We'll do a legit review.
[03:29:25.740 --> 03:29:27.580]  The better the product, the better the review.
[03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:28.380]  We'll check it out.
[03:29:28.580 --> 03:29:29.500]  We'll put it to use.
[03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:30.500]  I'm a smart dude.
[03:29:30.500 --> 03:29:31.420]  I know how to use products.
[03:29:31.420 --> 03:29:34.260]  I know how to set the settings to where they need to be for my comfort level.
[03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:35.660]  And we'll get it figured out and we'll use it.
[03:29:35.900 --> 03:29:36.980]  If you need it back, let me know.
[03:29:36.980 --> 03:29:38.220]  We'll ship the damn thing back to you.
[03:29:38.220 --> 03:29:39.740]  If it's a product that can be shipped back.
[03:29:40.260 --> 03:29:40.980]  We'll take care of you.
[03:29:40.980 --> 03:29:44.660]  So if you've got a product, you'd like to review like us to review, um, it's
[03:29:44.700 --> 03:29:46.340]  grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[03:29:46.340 --> 03:29:48.780]  We'd love to check out your toys, your inventions, whatever you need
[03:29:48.780 --> 03:29:49.740]  put out there on the market.
[03:29:50.140 --> 03:29:52.420]  A lot of people will hear about your product.
[03:29:52.660 --> 03:29:55.220]  Mike and I, maybe Lindsay, whoever else is hanging out.
[03:29:55.220 --> 03:29:55.900]  We'll check it out.
[03:29:56.300 --> 03:29:57.260]  We'll see what's going on.
[03:29:57.260 --> 03:29:58.940]  It's a frightening number of people with this.
[03:29:59.060 --> 03:30:00.220]  We do hit a lot of people.
[03:30:00.220 --> 03:30:02.740]  I don't even like to talk about how many people we reach when I have guests
[03:30:02.740 --> 03:30:03.980]  here, because it kind of freaks you guys out.
[03:30:03.980 --> 03:30:05.860]  Sometimes you go silent and you get all pale.
[03:30:06.380 --> 03:30:10.860]  No, I just, this week, uh, in particular, I got some feedback from a listener
[03:30:10.860 --> 03:30:13.980]  that mentioned that the last week was as high as they'd ever heard me.
[03:30:13.980 --> 03:30:15.500]  And I was like, how we topped it up.
[03:30:15.500 --> 03:30:17.780]  So nice to say, shout out to Seb.
[03:30:17.940 --> 03:30:18.620]  Thanks for listening.
[03:30:18.620 --> 03:30:19.940]  Rasta said, we appreciate it.
[03:30:20.060 --> 03:30:21.020]  Shout out to Fred Garvin.
[03:30:21.020 --> 03:30:22.620]  Shout out to everybody that listens to the podcast.
[03:30:22.620 --> 03:30:23.260]  We appreciate it.
[03:30:23.260 --> 03:30:23.900]  It's really rad.
[03:30:24.180 --> 03:30:26.180]  I like all the interaction, all the support I've been getting.
[03:30:26.620 --> 03:30:28.420]  Tons more emails and messages.
[03:30:28.420 --> 03:30:30.900]  And I think a lot of it is because we are now on talk radio.
[03:30:30.900 --> 03:30:34.380]  So I think people are tuning into talk radio and discovering the podcast there.
[03:30:34.380 --> 03:30:37.980]  Cause I'm finding totally new people in my inbox that I've never listened to.
[03:30:38.340 --> 03:30:42.060]  I just discovered there's a whole nother fucking inbox on my Facebook account.
[03:30:42.060 --> 03:30:43.060]  I've got three inboxes.
[03:30:43.060 --> 03:30:43.500]  What the fuck?
[03:30:43.500 --> 03:30:44.540]  There's like the request.
[03:30:44.540 --> 03:30:47.580]  One, there's another one too, like the filtered one or something
[03:30:47.580 --> 03:30:48.580]  that I've never seen.
[03:30:48.940 --> 03:30:51.460]  So yeah, you don't have to show me that black hole.
[03:30:51.500 --> 03:30:52.780]  I don't even know how it popped up.
[03:30:52.780 --> 03:30:53.780]  I can't find it again.
[03:30:53.780 --> 03:30:56.220]  So I feel like I need to go on my computer and open up Facebook.
[03:30:56.220 --> 03:30:58.140]  I took a screenshot to be like, where did this come from?
[03:30:58.140 --> 03:31:00.340]  So that I could try to find it when I had more time to surf.
[03:31:00.380 --> 03:31:01.500]  But yeah.
[03:31:01.500 --> 03:31:04.180]  So if you have sent me a Facebook message at my personal account,
[03:31:04.180 --> 03:31:05.780]  I apologize that I haven't gotten back to you.
[03:31:05.780 --> 03:31:07.220]  I don't suck that bad at life.
[03:31:07.780 --> 03:31:09.900]  Uh, somebody bitched at me for not getting back to them right away.
[03:31:10.100 --> 03:31:15.140]  I get no shit, 25 to 50, maybe a hundred Facebook messages and emails a day.
[03:31:15.540 --> 03:31:17.220]  And it's hard to get to all of them.
[03:31:17.220 --> 03:31:21.260]  So there'll be a random day of the week when I have maybe 10 or 20 minutes to
[03:31:21.260 --> 03:31:24.260]  chill out, I'm eating lunch, eating a sandwich and I'll reply to six emails
[03:31:24.260 --> 03:31:25.220]  right then, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:31:25.220 --> 03:31:26.220]  As quickly as I can.
[03:31:26.620 --> 03:31:28.020]  And those are the six that I got.
[03:31:28.020 --> 03:31:29.900]  And then I'll get the next six next time.
[03:31:29.900 --> 03:31:31.860]  Cause I mean, I had a lot of shit going on.
[03:31:31.860 --> 03:31:32.700]  Sometimes it's hard.
[03:31:34.180 --> 03:31:35.060]  That's my rant on that.
[03:31:35.300 --> 03:31:35.900]  So yeah.
[03:31:36.180 --> 03:31:39.500]  Uh, send me an email, go from your heart to hotmail.com or review your products.
[03:31:39.620 --> 03:31:40.580]  That's where I was with all that.
[03:31:40.620 --> 03:31:43.100]  I don't even have notes in front of me and I had a little land back on the map.
[03:31:43.580 --> 03:31:44.780]  Uh, what else do we got?
[03:31:44.780 --> 03:31:46.740]  Any announcements or anything you guys elevate?
[03:31:46.740 --> 03:31:47.620]  That's what's important.
[03:31:47.620 --> 03:31:48.140]  Elevate.
[03:31:48.140 --> 03:31:51.020]  If you need glass, if you need smoking accessories, if you want to see cool
[03:31:51.020 --> 03:31:52.220]  glass, you don't have to buy shit.
[03:31:52.500 --> 03:31:53.580]  They're a glass gallery.
[03:31:53.580 --> 03:31:54.500]  You can go take a look.
[03:31:54.500 --> 03:31:56.860]  They will not be mad at you for looking and not buying.
[03:31:57.140 --> 03:31:58.420]  And go see Inky the dog.
[03:31:58.460 --> 03:31:59.340]  Inky's a sweet puppy.
[03:31:59.340 --> 03:32:00.500]  Go give him a scratch on the forehead.
[03:32:00.500 --> 03:32:01.620]  Now he's probably afraid of you.
[03:32:01.620 --> 03:32:02.300]  He'll run from you.
[03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:02.860]  I'm so tall.
[03:32:04.340 --> 03:32:06.380]  But to go in there, see Inky, go see all the lovely ladies.
[03:32:06.380 --> 03:32:06.980]  Go tell him what's up.
[03:32:07.020 --> 03:32:07.780]  Elevate glass.
[03:32:07.980 --> 03:32:09.300]  517 South day home.
[03:32:09.300 --> 03:32:09.660]  Check it out.
[03:32:09.660 --> 03:32:13.620]  If you're on Tayhoan and you want to park and it's all crowded on
[03:32:13.620 --> 03:32:15.380]  Tayhoan and you don't have money for the meter, fuck it.
[03:32:15.380 --> 03:32:16.740]  Turn left or right on Moreno.
[03:32:16.740 --> 03:32:18.300]  I think it's either Monterey or Moreno.
[03:32:18.900 --> 03:32:20.420]  Starts with an M right there.
[03:32:20.460 --> 03:32:21.260]  Free parking.
[03:32:21.460 --> 03:32:21.780]  Boom.
[03:32:22.180 --> 03:32:23.020]  Don't pay for parking.
[03:32:23.020 --> 03:32:23.740]  Why would you do that?
[03:32:23.740 --> 03:32:24.780]  Just go park for free.
[03:32:25.260 --> 03:32:26.780]  Like there's that bar across the street.
[03:32:26.780 --> 03:32:27.620]  That's got a live band.
[03:32:27.620 --> 03:32:28.540]  It's always all crowded.
[03:32:28.540 --> 03:32:29.500]  It's hard to park right there.
[03:32:29.580 --> 03:32:30.380]  Don't hit the meters.
[03:32:30.380 --> 03:32:32.540]  Just turn left or turn right after you pass the place.
[03:32:32.540 --> 03:32:33.060]  You'll be cool.
[03:32:33.620 --> 03:32:34.220]  It's all legit.
[03:32:34.260 --> 03:32:35.020]  Sunshiny out.
[03:32:35.020 --> 03:32:35.940]  Go take a little walk.
[03:32:37.220 --> 03:32:40.460]  I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but hey, save some money.
[03:32:40.660 --> 03:32:42.340]  What would Joey DSA take a risk?
[03:32:42.340 --> 03:32:43.100]  Columbus did.
[03:32:45.740 --> 03:32:47.660]  You guys, that's all the podcast we've got for you this week.
[03:32:47.660 --> 03:32:49.980]  I want to thank my friends for coming and hanging out with me for a couple hours.
[03:32:50.340 --> 03:32:52.740]  I felt a little bit shitty the past couple of days and some good
[03:32:52.740 --> 03:32:53.620]  vibes with some good friends.
[03:32:53.620 --> 03:32:54.460]  We'll definitely cheer you up.
[03:32:54.500 --> 03:32:55.860]  Make you forget that you didn't feel good.
[03:32:56.020 --> 03:32:56.980]  So thanks for coming guys.
[03:32:57.740 --> 03:32:58.500]  Take some vitamins.
[03:32:58.500 --> 03:32:59.140]  Don't get sick.
[03:32:59.980 --> 03:33:00.940]  I might've wanted to warn you.
[03:33:01.580 --> 03:33:03.660]  Might've wanted to say that before he came over, but, uh,
[03:33:06.540 --> 03:33:06.980]  there you go.
[03:33:06.980 --> 03:33:07.940]  It's everybody out there.
[03:33:07.980 --> 03:33:09.660]  Uh, take some vitamins, take good care of yourself.
[03:33:09.700 --> 03:33:10.860]  Fucking hydrate this summer.
[03:33:10.860 --> 03:33:14.580]  You guys, if you're at a festival region, uh, beer is not hydration.
[03:33:15.060 --> 03:33:15.300]  Dr.
[03:33:15.300 --> 03:33:16.420]  Pepper is not hydration.
[03:33:16.420 --> 03:33:17.660]  Mike, I hate to break it to you, dude.
[03:33:17.700 --> 03:33:19.340]  Mountain dew will not hydrate you.
[03:33:19.340 --> 03:33:20.380]  That will keep you diabetic.
[03:33:22.380 --> 03:33:22.900]  Drink water.
[03:33:22.900 --> 03:33:23.660]  It's good for you.
[03:33:23.980 --> 03:33:24.820]  Hydrate yourself.
[03:33:24.860 --> 03:33:25.780]  Hydrate your plants.
[03:33:26.660 --> 03:33:27.580]  Take good care of yourself.
[03:33:27.620 --> 03:33:28.780]  You're out there in the sunshine.
[03:33:29.420 --> 03:33:30.100]  Love yourself.
[03:33:30.660 --> 03:33:32.140]  It's been special hot lately.
[03:33:32.140 --> 03:33:33.260]  I hope y'all are staying cool.
[03:33:33.780 --> 03:33:34.860]  Especially outdoor growers.
[03:33:34.860 --> 03:33:37.620]  Shout out to all the outdoor farmers that are out there getting burnt as shit.
[03:33:37.620 --> 03:33:41.380]  If you're out, if you're out working outdoors right now, man, God bless you.
[03:33:41.420 --> 03:33:42.020]  I'm spoiled.
[03:33:42.020 --> 03:33:43.300]  I'm in a big indoor facility.
[03:33:43.300 --> 03:33:44.780]  It's 74 degrees all the time.
[03:33:44.780 --> 03:33:45.380]  It's super hot.
[03:33:45.380 --> 03:33:48.860]  When I go to lunch, it's pretty hot between the facility and when the air
[03:33:48.860 --> 03:33:50.540]  conditioner starts kicking in my car.
[03:33:50.860 --> 03:33:51.820]  That's pretty much where I am.
[03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:53.980]  Mike's got pretty much the same thing.
[03:33:54.300 --> 03:33:58.180]  Yeah, we, uh, it was like 83 for a minute in the bedroom.
[03:33:58.180 --> 03:34:00.500]  The other day at work, it was like 105 outside.
[03:34:01.220 --> 03:34:04.900]  Um, and it just, it took a minute to get the AC powered up enough
[03:34:04.900 --> 03:34:06.220]  to cool it down and hollow.
[03:34:06.220 --> 03:34:06.940]  Holy hell.
[03:34:08.140 --> 03:34:12.500]  I haven't had to use the go outside and really bake yourself so that to make it
[03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:15.300]  tolerable inside for the next half hour trick in a while.
[03:34:15.300 --> 03:34:17.260]  And I had to break that one out again this week.
[03:34:18.380 --> 03:34:18.700]  Yep.
[03:34:20.660 --> 03:34:21.580]  That's serious.
[03:34:21.620 --> 03:34:22.180]  Yeah.
[03:34:23.540 --> 03:34:25.500]  All right, guys, we just got real deep and serious.
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:28.220]  I almost feel like we should do something fun right now.
[03:34:28.220 --> 03:34:29.340]  Like a sticker pack thing.
[03:34:29.340 --> 03:34:32.260]  That's just real easy to do for the, like the two people that are still
[03:34:32.260 --> 03:34:33.900]  listening, you got some stickers to donate.
[03:34:34.060 --> 03:34:35.500]  No, it'd be like $4.
[03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:39.060]  No, we can, we can give out what do you, what's, what kind of prize
[03:34:39.060 --> 03:34:40.260]  you want to offer on this episode?
[03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:42.020]  I totally have mad stuff.
[03:34:42.020 --> 03:34:43.780]  So I've got sticker packs.
[03:34:44.460 --> 03:34:46.220]  I have plenty of stuff I can throw into this too.
[03:34:46.780 --> 03:34:48.580]  Actually, I do have a stack of stickers.
[03:34:48.580 --> 03:34:49.820]  I could throw it to make some rules.
[03:34:49.820 --> 03:34:50.940]  What do people have to do, bro?
[03:34:50.980 --> 03:34:53.460]  Cause we've gone an hour and five minutes and if they're still listening,
[03:34:53.460 --> 03:34:54.740]  they're dedicated listeners.
[03:34:54.740 --> 03:34:55.900]  Tweet all three of us.
[03:34:56.100 --> 03:34:56.460]  All right.
[03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:57.780]  Tweet all three of us.
[03:34:58.100 --> 03:34:58.380]  Yep.
[03:34:58.780 --> 03:34:59.300]  What else?
[03:34:59.700 --> 03:35:00.100]  That's it.
[03:35:00.660 --> 03:35:01.620]  What do they have to tweet us?
[03:35:02.140 --> 03:35:05.500]  Uh, they can make one tweet.
[03:35:06.740 --> 03:35:09.260]  Uh, one tweet tag us all three, the traveling stoner.
[03:35:09.660 --> 03:35:13.340]  Um, the travel stoner, the travel stoner.
[03:35:13.380 --> 03:35:15.060]  We didn't even let you guys do your plugs.
[03:35:15.060 --> 03:35:15.420]  I'm sorry.
[03:35:15.420 --> 03:35:20.820]  The travel stoner, Nemo punk 15 and, uh, at GFYH podcast.
[03:35:20.820 --> 03:35:21.860]  You can't tag my personal one.
[03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:24.220]  You got to follow the instructions at GFYH podcast.
[03:35:24.220 --> 03:35:25.180]  I'm writing that down.
[03:35:26.420 --> 03:35:27.860]  I'm going to remember that.
[03:35:27.860 --> 03:35:28.700]  I'm going to be behind.
[03:35:28.700 --> 03:35:29.060]  Forget.
[03:35:29.380 --> 03:35:30.580]  Uh, you got to tweet all three of us.
[03:35:30.820 --> 03:35:33.660]  The travel stoner Nemo punk 15 at GFYH podcast.
[03:35:33.660 --> 03:35:34.500]  Tweet us.
[03:35:34.700 --> 03:35:35.540]  What are you going to tweet us?
[03:35:35.780 --> 03:35:36.980]  Should we ask a question?
[03:35:36.980 --> 03:35:40.140]  The first person who answers, um, I guess it was not really a first person, right?
[03:35:40.140 --> 03:35:42.140]  There's just like one that will be listening.
[03:35:42.980 --> 03:35:44.020]  That's just a guess.
[03:35:44.060 --> 03:35:44.660]  Okay, cool.
[03:35:44.740 --> 03:35:48.300]  This kind of went everywhere and I feel like we've lost the people that were like,
[03:35:48.340 --> 03:35:50.380]  well, I'm looking for a dedicated show about growing.
[03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:50.700]  Nope.
[03:35:50.780 --> 03:35:51.100]  Oh yeah.
[03:35:51.100 --> 03:35:51.300]  Yeah.
[03:35:51.300 --> 03:35:52.340]  A lot of people have tuned out.
[03:35:52.380 --> 03:35:54.980]  I think the people that like it when we ramble are still here.
[03:35:55.900 --> 03:36:00.020]  The first one to say hashtag, I like it when you ramble, right?
[03:36:00.180 --> 03:36:02.900]  Hasn't this been just one, but they got to tweet all three of us.
[03:36:02.900 --> 03:36:03.260]  Yeah.
[03:36:03.340 --> 03:36:03.700]  Do it.
[03:36:03.940 --> 03:36:04.380]  All right.
[03:36:04.540 --> 03:36:05.980]  Again, you guys hashtag.
[03:36:05.980 --> 03:36:06.940]  I like it when you ramble.
[03:36:06.940 --> 03:36:07.900]  It'd be a nice sticker pack.
[03:36:07.900 --> 03:36:11.540]  You got to get all three of us and then just, you could, you could, you could say
[03:36:11.540 --> 03:36:14.900]  something in the message also, if you'd like to like send me some fucking stickers,
[03:36:14.900 --> 03:36:16.220]  bro, something like that.
[03:36:16.260 --> 03:36:16.740]  It'd be cool.
[03:36:16.780 --> 03:36:20.460]  You know, and we will get some stickers out and this we'll have to put an expiration
[03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:21.020]  date on this.
[03:36:21.020 --> 03:36:25.980]  This episode is going to come out, uh, around the 1st of July.
[03:36:25.980 --> 03:36:29.700]  So this ends August 15th, August 15th.
[03:36:29.700 --> 03:36:30.380]  This will be over.
[03:36:31.100 --> 03:36:31.340]  Yeah.

[03:36:32.020 --> 03:36:33.260]  You guys got to August 15th.
[03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:36.140]  I just, I have to put an expiration date on shit because I forget that this is a
[03:36:36.140 --> 03:36:37.340]  podcast for you forever.
[03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:39.100]  Well, I want to do, I want to give you a shot.
[03:36:39.140 --> 03:36:41.500]  Mike, Mike just put work into the podcast.
[03:36:41.500 --> 03:36:42.980]  You just made me have to do shit now.
[03:36:43.020 --> 03:36:43.220]  Right?
[03:36:43.220 --> 03:36:43.300]  Yeah.
[03:36:43.300 --> 03:36:43.740]  That's okay.
[03:36:43.740 --> 03:36:44.380]  I'll send it out.
[03:36:44.380 --> 03:36:45.460]  If you just tell me who it is.
[03:36:45.620 --> 03:36:46.100]  I'm just kidding.
[03:36:46.380 --> 03:36:50.060]  It's easy, but I like Mike's a Mike's what's that ingenuity.
[03:36:50.220 --> 03:36:50.420]  Yep.
[03:36:51.460 --> 03:36:52.500]  It's not the word I'm looking for.
[03:36:52.540 --> 03:36:53.460]  No, no.
[03:36:53.500 --> 03:36:56.620]  It's the word when you just do stuff on your own initiative.
[03:36:56.740 --> 03:36:58.340]  Mike's got a Mike took initiative here.
[03:36:58.540 --> 03:36:59.940]  All right, guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[03:36:59.940 --> 03:37:00.980]  We've been going for so long.
[03:37:00.980 --> 03:37:04.700]  If you're listening to the show still, I love you.
[03:37:04.700 --> 03:37:05.820]  You got to be our friends or something.
[03:37:05.820 --> 03:37:06.780]  You're listening for a reason.
[03:37:07.060 --> 03:37:08.540]  Uh, well I've got some other episodes planned.
[03:37:08.540 --> 03:37:11.020]  This wasn't even really a, this was just happened today.
[03:37:11.020 --> 03:37:11.740]  So it was kind of rad.
[03:37:12.180 --> 03:37:15.380]  Uh, I've got some other episodes planned that are not quite so rambly.
[03:37:15.860 --> 03:37:17.100]  Um, I promise.
[03:37:17.700 --> 03:37:21.620]  And if you want us, if you'd like us to do a show on a specific topic, by all
[03:37:21.620 --> 03:37:26.380]  means, email, uh, you've got the email by now, emailing whatever your heart

[03:37:36.820 --> 03:37:39.180]  Well, yeah, I'll kick these guys out and do another show without him.
[03:37:39.180 --> 03:37:40.460]  You guys will put that out also.
[03:37:40.820 --> 03:37:41.660]  That was my bad.
[03:37:42.180 --> 03:37:42.980]  Nobody's bad at all.
[03:37:42.980 --> 03:37:44.220]  This is a great fucking podcast.
[03:37:44.220 --> 03:37:45.260]  I appreciate you guys for coming.
[03:37:45.260 --> 03:37:46.180]  Then nobody's bad at all.
[03:37:47.060 --> 03:37:51.940]  The hilarious part is I put the heavy hitter in the fridge for afterwards, so
[03:37:51.940 --> 03:37:54.700]  we wouldn't get to stone before the podcast.
[03:37:54.700 --> 03:37:55.900]  You've got ice hash in the fridge.
[03:37:55.900 --> 03:37:56.260]  Yeah.
[03:37:56.260 --> 03:38:00.460]  Oh, so that's why I was like, that's why I was laughing so hard that we got so
[03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:01.380]  high off this live.
[03:38:02.300 --> 03:38:05.540]  We're going to press out some solventless dabs when we wrap this podcast up.
[03:38:05.540 --> 03:38:06.340]  Hey guys, I got to go.
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:07.220]  We got some shit to do.
[03:38:07.220 --> 03:38:08.500]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[03:38:11.460 --> 03:38:14.260]  Uh, Chris said we're not allowed to smoke at all.
[03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:15.500]  That was his one.
[03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:17.060]  Uh, I know.
[03:38:17.500 --> 03:38:18.460]  Sorry, Bobo.
[03:38:18.620 --> 03:38:19.860]  Chris, you've been in Portugal.
[03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:22.140]  So he's in Florida now.
[03:38:22.420 --> 03:38:22.740]  Yeah.
[03:38:22.740 --> 03:38:23.580]  Yeah, exactly.

[03:38:27.540 --> 03:38:29.100]  Portugal's got some beautiful things.
[03:38:29.460 --> 03:38:30.740]  Uh, smoke that's in.
[03:38:30.860 --> 03:38:31.380]  Yeah, bro.

[03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:34.140]  Yeah, bro.
[03:38:34.180 --> 03:38:35.260]  You can't tell us what we can't do.
[03:38:35.340 --> 03:38:35.620]  Come on.
[03:38:36.860 --> 03:38:38.220]  We'll get you some more beach sand hash.
[03:38:38.220 --> 03:38:38.580]  Don't worry.

[03:38:40.780 --> 03:38:41.780]  I totally appreciate it.
[03:38:41.780 --> 03:38:42.620]  It was fun hanging out with you.
[03:38:42.620 --> 03:38:44.100]  I hope you got some insight into our lives.
[03:38:44.100 --> 03:38:46.100]  I hope you learned something about hanging out in dispensaries.
[03:38:46.340 --> 03:38:53.740]  I hope you learned that we got stupid high and we like, like it when I thought I knew
[03:38:53.740 --> 03:38:55.500]  where I was going with that, but I couldn't get there.
[03:38:56.100 --> 03:38:56.900]  I love you guys.
[03:38:56.900 --> 03:38:57.540]  Thanks for listening.
[03:38:57.780 --> 03:38:58.660]  Absolutely.
[03:38:58.780 --> 03:38:59.260]  That's it.
[03:38:59.340 --> 03:38:59.980]  All of that.
[03:39:00.340 --> 03:39:01.420]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[03:39:01.420 --> 03:39:05.060]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[03:40:22.110 --> 03:40:24.070]  So sideways, cheese and killing.
[03:43:25.220 --> 03:43:26.180]  All right, podcast world.

[03:43:50.980 --> 03:43:54.540]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[03:45:06.980 --> 03:45:07.980]  I know.
[03:45:31.680 --> 03:45:33.760]  He used to teach at my high school.
[03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:36.880]  He caused quite an uproar.
[03:45:37.400 --> 03:45:40.360]  With diamonds and fives and a ring on each finger.
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:48.440]  None of us raised our hand to ask him why.
[03:45:49.760 --> 03:45:52.240]  Because it was a hell of a chore.
[03:45:52.440 --> 03:45:54.440]  Look at him and who's why.
[03:45:54.440 --> 03:45:57.960]  It was a horror show.
[03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:45.220]  They were the topic that made her rock so great.
[03:48:46.420 --> 03:48:51.140]  Went to the preacher to save their souls and they said it's not too late.
[03:48:52.660 --> 03:48:57.100]  When we asked them about their car and their finest day.
[03:48:58.540 --> 03:49:00.980]  They said we like who we are.
[03:49:01.460 --> 03:49:02.980]  And we're feeling great.
[03:49:02.980 --> 03:49:05.180]  Oh, no.
