[01:52.260 --> 01:58.740]  All right, guys. Jesse came over and we pretty much wrapped up the flushing and harvesting
[01:58.780 --> 02:03.260]  and trimming section of the outdoor lesson. So I'm not going to waste any time. Let's
[02:03.260 --> 02:08.580]  go ahead and get right to that. All right, podcast world, we are back. We're here to
[02:08.580 --> 02:12.260]  pretty much wrap up the outdoor grossies and Jesse's with me. How's it going, bro?
[02:12.260 --> 02:14.300]  Pretty good. How's it going, everyone?
[02:14.300 --> 02:19.020]  We're both dabbed out, so we're going to have another one of those episodes. Grab some pens
[02:19.020 --> 02:22.220]  and paper, guys. You guys might want to take notes for this one. I was told that people
[02:22.220 --> 02:24.540]  are writing down shit that I say that kind of scares me.
[02:24.540 --> 02:25.740]  Oh, wow. Yeah.
[02:25.740 --> 02:30.500]  I was at a grow store. I was at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, and I was just there to
[02:30.500 --> 02:34.020]  pick up a couple of small random items, and a lady at the counter turned around and she
[02:34.020 --> 02:37.820]  said, Jeff, I know you know the answer. And she made me come over and shop for her a little
[02:37.820 --> 02:44.820]  bit. And honestly, the solution that I gave her, I learned from our good friend Jesse.
[02:44.900 --> 02:46.460]  What was the problem?
[02:46.460 --> 02:51.020]  She was trying to figure out. It wasn't a problem. She just wanted to know which bat
[02:51.020 --> 02:53.500]  guano to use late in the bloom season.
[02:53.500 --> 02:54.180]  For sure.
[02:54.180 --> 02:55.700]  Which one should she have used?
[02:55.740 --> 02:56.740]  The Jamaican.
[02:56.740 --> 03:00.140]  That's what I told her, bro. Gosh, I'm so glad I was right. I told her Jamaican late
[03:00.140 --> 03:02.180]  in the season, and I learned that from my buddy Jesse.
[03:02.180 --> 03:02.700]  Nice.
[03:02.700 --> 03:05.900]  Awesome. So I hope you listen to the podcast because I told you that you should. And now
[03:05.900 --> 03:10.380]  we have proven that you're right. And I have also admitted that I was only 90% sure of
[03:10.380 --> 03:13.580]  that when I told you that at the grow store.
[03:13.580 --> 03:16.580]  Bern knew what she was talking about, though. Shout out to Bern. You do a good job at the
[03:16.580 --> 03:18.940]  Hydro Shop. It looks great. I appreciate it.
[03:18.940 --> 03:19.940]  Yeah.
[03:19.940 --> 03:22.940]  Yeah. Guys, go to Hygro Pueblo. The place is awesome.
[03:22.940 --> 03:29.740]  We got some big news coming up. I can't say it yet, but it has to do with a really popular
[03:29.740 --> 03:30.940]  new lighting system.
[03:30.940 --> 03:35.340]  Oh, I don't even know the news yet. I'm going to have to grill Jesse here in a second and
[03:35.340 --> 03:36.740]  find out what's going on.
[03:36.740 --> 03:42.740]  Yeah. What else? Oh, we got a sell on the...
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.740]  Was it Black Label?
[03:43.740 --> 03:44.740]  Yeah, Black Label.
[03:44.740 --> 03:47.740]  Black Label Nutrients. Are they 50% off?
[03:47.740 --> 03:49.740]  10% above cost.
[03:50.540 --> 03:53.940]  10% above cost. So whatever... Check it out, guys. Whatever they paid for these nutrients,
[03:53.940 --> 03:58.460]  they're going to sell them to you for 10% above that. But after that, it will no longer
[03:58.460 --> 03:59.740]  carry the line of products.
[03:59.740 --> 04:03.660]  Yeah. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just not a big seller for us.
[04:03.660 --> 04:07.860]  It's a small shop. Also, you can't carry every single line in there.
[04:07.860 --> 04:11.900]  We replaced it with some Botanicare products, and we already sold out of the stuff we stocked
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.900]  in today.
[04:12.900 --> 04:16.540]  I recommend Botanicare strongly to everybody that I teach how to grow. So that could have
[04:16.540 --> 04:18.020]  some small factor.
[04:18.020 --> 04:20.020]  They're going to carry every product they have.
[04:20.020 --> 04:21.020]  Awesome. Thank you.
[04:21.020 --> 04:22.020]  Them and General Hydro Products.
[04:22.020 --> 04:26.540]  Guys, if you listen to this show, I don't talk a lot about the nutrients I use. I try
[04:26.540 --> 04:29.580]  to keep a lot of my... That's the kind of stuff that I like to let people experiment
[04:29.580 --> 04:34.940]  on their own. Botanicare doesn't pay me anything. Go to Hygro Pueblo, support their new... Their
[04:34.940 --> 04:39.220]  adventure. Is it a venture? Their new business venture in stocking their store with Botanicare.
[04:39.220 --> 04:43.960]  It's what I recommend. It's what I use. I promise. I've talked about grow feeding recipes
[04:43.960 --> 04:50.580]  and shit, and all of it is included Botanicare. Pureblend Pro Grow, the soil-based formula.
[04:50.580 --> 04:51.800]  It smells almost drinkable.
[04:51.800 --> 04:52.800]  Really?
[04:52.800 --> 04:55.760]  And for your nutrients to smell like you'd almost... I know there's chicken shit in there,
[04:55.760 --> 04:57.400]  so I don't really think about it.
[04:57.400 --> 04:59.400]  Well, we got that stocked in now.
[04:59.400 --> 05:01.440]  It's Cannabis Cup winning nutrients right there.
[05:01.440 --> 05:02.440]  Yeah.
[05:02.440 --> 05:03.440]  Awesome.
[05:03.440 --> 05:11.040]  I've always... I've used the NC... Oh, crap. SN91 or something like that.
[05:11.040 --> 05:13.080]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's more their commercial line.
[05:13.200 --> 05:14.200]  Yeah.
[05:14.200 --> 05:15.200]  It's good stuff.
[05:15.200 --> 05:16.200]  Yeah.
[05:16.200 --> 05:17.200]  You get what you pay for.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.480]  They seem to pay attention to what we're trying to do, and they're also good to the environment.
[05:19.480 --> 05:20.920]  They don't seem to be real dirty.
[05:20.920 --> 05:21.920]  Yeah.
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.880]  I like that. Liquid Karma is a good product. You can add Liquid Karma to any feed regimen,
[05:25.880 --> 05:26.880]  and it will help you out.
[05:26.880 --> 05:30.880]  Their Pureblend Tea or whatever it is.
[05:30.880 --> 05:34.880]  That's good stuff. Vitamino is a new product that they're putting out that is a good product.
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.160]  We got that now too.
[05:36.160 --> 05:41.440]  Foldex in a foliar spray is a good product. And OGT. See, none of these... We're not getting
[05:41.440 --> 05:44.680]  paid for any of these free commercials we're doing right now. This is just from our heart.
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.520]  That's what we do. It's what we use.
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.120]  High quality products that work.
[05:48.120 --> 05:50.720]  Yeah. We don't talk about bullshit on this show.
[05:50.720 --> 05:51.720]  Yeah.
[05:51.720 --> 05:54.840]  All right. So it is time to talk about the end of the grow season. Sorry, that music
[05:54.840 --> 05:59.160]  was kind of distracting both of us. Let's focus a little bit. Outdoor season's been
[05:59.160 --> 06:02.520]  fun. Nobody's stolen your shit, hopefully. You didn't have to shoot anybody.
[06:02.520 --> 06:04.640]  I'll accept one guy.
[06:04.640 --> 06:07.920]  I'll accept that one guy. Yeah. Hopefully, you got to harvest everything. Hopefully,
[06:08.080 --> 06:12.480]  you didn't get that frost on it that one night. It's coming up, guys. If you haven't cut down
[06:12.480 --> 06:16.320]  yet, you're a week or two away, maybe three or four weeks at the most, right?
[06:16.320 --> 06:18.880]  Yeah. Either that or you're prepared for the long haul.
[06:18.880 --> 06:22.800]  Yeah. You've got a greenhouse covered and you got a heater out there. So if you're just
[06:22.800 --> 06:27.760]  out in the backyard, it's really time to get your shit together. It's time to flush. Flushing
[06:27.760 --> 06:31.120]  is important. Even if you're... This is something that I've always wanted to touch on on the
[06:31.120 --> 06:35.920]  show. Let's talk for... We'll give it however much time this takes. We'll talk about flushing.
[06:35.920 --> 06:36.720]  Very important.
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.480]  Yeah. Flushing. As you're feeding all of your cannabis plants, you are pouring... Even if
[06:40.480 --> 06:44.720]  you're using organics, you're pouring stuff into the root zone that is staying in the
[06:44.720 --> 06:50.480]  soil and your plants are feeding off of that. You don't want to smoke whatever you're feeding
[06:50.480 --> 06:54.960]  your plants. You don't want that taste in your buds at the end. You don't want nitrogen.
[06:54.960 --> 06:57.680]  You don't want phosphorus. You don't want potassium in your buds.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.040]  Tasty.
[06:59.040 --> 07:04.640]  Oh, yeah. So the plant actually takes up nutrients. It puts the nutrients where they want. And
[07:04.640 --> 07:09.120]  then, yes, your plants do spit out the excess nutrients through the roots again. It basically
[07:09.120 --> 07:13.360]  shits them right out. I'm keeping this real simple. What we need to do now is flush the
[07:13.360 --> 07:17.520]  toilet. We need to get that poop soil out of there. We just want clean dirt.
[07:17.520 --> 07:18.080]  For sure.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.520]  And if you're recycling your dirt, this is a good point. This is where you actually start
[07:21.520 --> 07:25.760]  recycling your dirt, is at the flush of an indoor plant. So this works for the outdoor.
[07:25.760 --> 07:30.880]  We want to do this to every cannabis plant you ever grow before you harvest it. 10 to
[07:30.880 --> 07:37.040]  14 days before you cut down that plant, water the shit out of the plant. Water it as much
[07:37.040 --> 07:44.240]  as you can. And from then on out, only give it clean water. Just clean pH if you can.
[07:44.240 --> 07:49.280]  But this is the end. So just give it a lot of clean water. Water it real well. Go ahead.
[07:49.280 --> 07:50.320]  I'll let you jump in.
[07:50.320 --> 07:55.040]  On a container plant, say it's a 20-gallon container, I'll give it 20 gallons of water.
[07:55.840 --> 08:03.760]  And I want to see, pretty much you'll have, I don't know, 17 gallons of water come out probably.
[08:03.760 --> 08:04.080]  Yeah.
[08:04.080 --> 08:05.040]  And run off.
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.320]  I drag a seven-gallon pot to an area where I have a drain. And I will pour about 15 gallons
[08:12.320 --> 08:14.880]  of water through a seven-gallon pot. And-
[08:14.880 --> 08:16.800]  Repeat it. This is-
[08:16.800 --> 08:20.560]  Yeah. Just keep pouring water. You get however much water you can fill that pot with. Pour it
[08:20.560 --> 08:24.560]  in there. Let it drain through. It'll pour out. Go back in a couple of minutes, pour another pitcher
[08:24.560 --> 08:29.280]  or a bucket or whatever you're using. Pour more water in there. If you can set the hose in your
[08:29.280 --> 08:35.040]  plants, on your pot plants, water them until you're afraid that it's over-watered. You're not
[08:35.040 --> 08:38.720]  too worried about killing them at this point. It is the end of the season. You won't over-water
[08:38.720 --> 08:42.240]  them. They're outdoors. That water will go somewhere. You want to get all that nutrients
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.240]  off there. The indoor container plants, Jesse's perfect on that. Just water that pot as much as
[08:46.240 --> 08:50.400]  you can. If you have to, it's kind of hard to get a plant somewhere if you're working a seven-gallon
[08:50.400 --> 08:53.440]  pot. You need to get it kind of up off the ground so it'll drain properly.
[08:53.920 --> 08:58.080]  A shop vac is your best friend if you don't have adequate drainage.
[08:58.080 --> 09:02.560]  That's kind of where I was headed. A lot of you guys are growing in the basement and you got a
[09:02.560 --> 09:06.880]  dedicated bathroom. Set that sucker in the shower. Put it up on two cinder blocks under the pot so
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.280]  that it doesn't go anywhere. That creates a lot of drainage space. That water will pour right out of
[09:11.280 --> 09:15.120]  those bottom holes of the pot. If you got a three-gallon pot, set that. Put a couple of
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.680]  cinder blocks in your garage maybe where you can get some water going. If you got a cool backyard
[09:19.760 --> 09:23.600]  where your stash is kind of hidden, you don't want to show your pot plants to your neighbors.
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.400]  Be real careful about bringing bugs in. This is the end. You got to flush them real good always.
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.360]  14. It's 10 to 14 days with nothing but water. If you had any nutrient burn problems,
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.680]  get in there maybe a week before. I don't think you can over flush.
[09:39.600 --> 09:42.720]  Yeah, no. The only thing you're going to do is kill it. It's going to run out. It's going to
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.720]  be starved to death. You drown the roots because you're giving it 15 gallons every day. This is
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.680]  a good idea. Flushing will help your plants burn better. They'll dry and cure better.
[09:55.680 --> 10:01.120]  They'll smoke better. They'll taste better. They'll smell better. Have you ever smoked pot
[10:01.120 --> 10:06.240]  that it almost tastes like you just stuck your tongue in a light socket and leaves that burnt
[10:06.240 --> 10:11.040]  shit on your tongue? That probably had not been flushed. I feel like I can name the brand of
[10:11.040 --> 10:17.360]  nutrients sometimes. I can taste worm castings a lot of times in people's weed. I can taste
[10:17.360 --> 10:21.520]  advanced nutrients. Honestly, if you overdo a couple of things in botanic care, I can taste it.
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.080]  If you overdo it and don't flush it. Lucas formula always has its own.
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.160]  I think GH always brings out the limonene smell. I think a candy,
[10:34.160 --> 10:39.760]  lemony, lemon head candy kind of smell when you use GH. I think so. If you've got something that
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.480]  you want that is a lemon strain and you want to bring out that lemon, feed it the general
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.200]  hydroponics. Also, I don't say this a lot. This is a secretive thing that a lot of us know.
[10:49.200 --> 10:53.440]  One of those things that you have to read a lot to learn. Stressing the plant with light
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.680]  stress and heat will bring out limonene. If you're trying to lemon up your lemon strains,
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.760]  drop that light a little bit too close around week six of ripening and you'll bring out the
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.000]  limonene terpenoid. I've heard you say that. That'll also stress your plants a little bit.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.400]  You're going to have to adjust on that. Your top leaves are going to brown up.
[11:09.360 --> 11:12.960]  Sometimes we're not growing for pretty plants. Sometimes it's what you got to do.
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.880]  Girl Scout cookies is gorgeous right up until about week eight and then she's so ugly.
[11:18.880 --> 11:22.960]  She just goes, wow, I'm done. Well, she's pretty up close. She's, oh man,
[11:22.960 --> 11:27.360]  you get to taste her head. Oh man. My girl's got cookies bag is in another room. So I'm
[11:27.360 --> 11:30.800]  teasing you. Check out this a girl's a gorilla glue number four nugget. I'm going to reach.
[11:31.680 --> 11:36.160]  Oh, nice. I actually haven't seen anything. That's the finished product of the gorilla
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.400]  glue. Everybody around here is passing. It looks like an old skunk nugget.
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.800]  Or some, uh, or Cola, I should say. Yeah, that's, that's a nice shout out to a elbow.
[11:44.800 --> 11:48.000]  He does not listen to the show. I don't think, but I'll get him to, and he'll hear this.
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.040]  That's well done. He did a good job with that. Gorilla glue. Number four. I don't know if it's
[11:53.040 --> 11:59.120]  ready yet. Is it smokeable? It's a little, it's moist. Hey, there's a nice little prop for when
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.760]  we get to caring. There we go. Some people hate the word moist. So I had to throw in moist out
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.000]  there because you know, it does that. All right. We've kind of ranted on about flushing. The point
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.440]  here is flush your damn weed. We can tell the people that can tell, can tell, and they're the
[12:13.440 --> 12:20.400]  ones that you want to impress. If it's hydro flushing is even more important. Um, don't
[12:20.400 --> 12:26.080]  really talk about hydro growing very much. And there's a reason for that, but, um, I have zero
[12:26.080 --> 12:32.000]  experience in hydro. I run an easy cloner. That's about as far as I get. I've seen a Sparky weed
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.200]  from hydro weed, uh, or from hydro system. You're constantly, if you've got a res full of nutrients,
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.520]  you're constantly pumping that plant. It's very important. Actually. Um, it's important throughout
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.120]  the entire growth cycle. Um, every couple of weeks you should be flushing, um, and using one of those
[12:47.120 --> 12:51.760]  flush products, clear X. I was just about to ask, how do you feel about those flush products? Uh,
[12:51.760 --> 12:59.920]  not necessarily for dirt, in my opinion. Um, but, uh, for, for hydroponics, um, you need it to help
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.360]  flush your medium off. So, and those things break up salts is mainly what they do. Cool.
[13:06.240 --> 13:12.240]  They're, uh, they're all like a sugar of some like a sucrose of something. So I didn't know that.
[13:12.240 --> 13:18.320]  Yeah. I've never researched what they are. Yeah. I don't know exactly how it works. I'm dancing all
[13:18.320 --> 13:22.960]  over the mic on Jeff. That's all right. I'm going to get them honed in. I'm turning myself down so
[13:22.960 --> 13:28.960]  that I can turn you up and it'll make a sound. Even I am super fucking stoned. So I'm not getting
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.320]  you very well on the computer. Uh, talk, talk into the mic real good for me for a second. Hello,
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.840]  really stoned. Come up. Kind of. All right. I need to come up good enough. We'll keep you going.
[13:38.720 --> 13:41.840]  I don't know how to turn just you up anymore without making it weird. We'll do it. We're
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.320]  cool. Cause if he's too quiet, I apologize. We're high. Yeah. So flushing your plants
[13:46.320 --> 13:49.040]  really good is really important. You want to impress Jesse and I with your weed. And the
[13:49.040 --> 13:52.240]  only way you're going to do it, the only way you're going to win a cannabis cup is by flushing
[13:52.240 --> 13:57.280]  your weed. Also, you don't want to give sick people weed with shit in it. That's not what a
[13:57.280 --> 14:01.120]  caregiver does. It's not what a compassionate person does. It's not what a responsible person
[14:01.120 --> 14:04.560]  does. You're on the other team and you're growing that weed that should be illegal.
[14:04.560 --> 14:09.040]  You're on this reason that makes prohibition happen. If you're going weed that has not been
[14:09.040 --> 14:14.800]  flushed. Exactly what he said. The look on your face is like, shit. You think about that? Yeah.
[14:14.800 --> 14:20.960]  Not even know which side you're on. Not even sick people. Like, you know, that's, you just don't
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.320]  want to put that in anyone's body. Right. That's horrible thing to do to someone.
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.640]  All right. So you flush your plants now it's time. Oh, we're going to talk about de-leafing.
[14:30.720 --> 14:37.440]  Um, after you flush a few days before harvest time, you want to get in there and take off the
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.920]  fan leaves, all those big leaves that are in your way. If they've got what's called a petiole,
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.240]  that's the stem that reaches to the large. There's some other people pronounce it differently. You
[14:46.240 --> 14:50.560]  can tweet me and argue me. That's just how I've read it. So anything with the petiole,
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.880]  you can reach and cut off, chop all those leaves off, clean those things out of your grow room.
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.600]  Don't just chop them and leave them on the floor. Those bring bugs. Feed them to your chickens. If
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.840]  you've had a clean grow room, you can possibly juice those if you're into it. Yeah. Throw those
[15:03.840 --> 15:09.280]  right in there with your kale and your white people smoothie. All right. So get in there and
[15:09.280 --> 15:15.280]  cut off all those fan leaves. Um, you can cut off some of the outer leaf if you want, but you might
[15:15.280 --> 15:19.440]  want to save that. If you're making a hash, just decide how much trichome is on that. If there's
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.200]  not a trichome on it, you can take it off right now. Like you mentioned Girl Scout cookies. They
[15:23.200 --> 15:28.800]  always have a little, uh, petiole coming out of the nug. Yeah. Such a long one too. You know,
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.240]  depending on how far it is, like you said, with hash, um, some of them are a little closer. I'll
[15:34.240 --> 15:38.960]  keep that one on there just cause I see that little, little bit of resin on there and I can
[15:38.960 --> 15:46.720]  get greedy with resin. We're resin farmers, bro. That's our goal. Um, but yeah, if it's very long,
[15:46.720 --> 15:53.200]  I cut that fucker off, you know, coming out, out of the bud. So clarify that a little bit.
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.840]  I found a knob that'll turn everything up a little. Yeah. Nice. All right. So, uh,
[15:59.040 --> 16:03.120]  cut off all those fan leaves. Now, while you're flushing, you've got a few days now,
[16:03.120 --> 16:06.720]  you know, you're flushing, you know, harvest is coming. You've taken off the fan leaves.
[16:06.720 --> 16:12.320]  Now's the time to prepare the harvesting, the trimming and the drying area. You need a space.
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.240]  All right, let's go back real quick. I like that. One more thing. Um,
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.200]  how do you feel about like the sweetening agents molasses?
[16:21.200 --> 16:25.760]  Oh, I use the shit out of molasses. Um, with my outdoor stuff. Um,
[16:26.960 --> 16:32.880]  the first I start flushing really early. Um, like I actually, I started two plants flushing this week.
[16:32.880 --> 16:41.200]  Um, uh, I give them two molasses feedings, uh, before I actually start flushing and it's just
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.240]  molasses, but it's, it's pretty heavy. So I know what's going into my plants and this is, uh,
[16:46.240 --> 16:50.560]  so I try to keep it basic cause I don't want to get too complicated. So I just, I just,
[16:50.720 --> 16:53.440]  I don't want to steer anybody wrong. I want everybody to learn the right steps,
[16:53.440 --> 16:58.800]  but I do sort of something similar. I feed them enzymes, carbohydrates and molasses at the end.
[16:58.800 --> 17:03.120]  For sure. So they'll get some hygros. I'm has the enzymes I prefer and they'll get the molasses
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.880]  and uh, sometimes maybe some yucca extract and coconut water and Sucanat
[17:10.960 --> 17:18.000]  that's yucca extract and coconut water and Sucanat on that last one too. And hygros I'm
[17:18.080 --> 17:24.240]  on that last flush day. So I've got 14 days. That's like day 14. That's a really strong
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.640]  that. And then from then out I flush, but I don't overfeed. I feel like I don't overfeed
[17:28.640 --> 17:33.200]  and I've got plenty of space to flush properly. Like I can, I drag a plant to a watering area and
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.640]  just run the fucking hose on it until it's flushed. So that's nice. Yeah. It's actually
[17:38.640 --> 17:42.960]  just, I converted the old bathroom that was in the work joint into the flushing spot. So
[17:43.040 --> 17:47.440]  the guy's got a P with no stalls. My building doesn't have indoor plumbing. So
[17:48.320 --> 17:53.200]  ouch. Yeah. Uh, guys, if you have all that stuff that you're taking for granted, you're,
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.280]  you're way ahead of the game sometimes. Yeah. There are people that there are guys that have
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.360]  been growing since before we could talk about growing. You had to go to the hydro shop with
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.600]  your hat down in your face. Dude, I've got dreadlocks to my ass. Like rent a car. I get
[18:05.600 --> 18:11.840]  looked at like that guy grows weed even if I'm not at the hydro store. So yeah, Colorado is awesome.
[18:11.840 --> 18:17.680]  All right. So we flushed, we've used some sugars and enzymes and coconut water and some yucca
[18:17.680 --> 18:21.440]  extract. You don't have to use them all at the same time. Um, you can use these differently.
[18:21.440 --> 18:25.360]  The Sukunat may need a little while to break down. So you may need something to help that happen.
[18:25.360 --> 18:32.000]  The enzymes are going to be good. Uh, so we have de-leafed, uh, we're preparing the dry space,
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.560]  right? Is that where we are? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, very, very, very important. Yeah. Clean up your
[18:36.560 --> 18:43.840]  drying and trimming space. Any dust, dog hair, hippie hair, uh, all the crap that's on my table.
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.160]  I think it's just a bunch of dab resin to tell you the truth, but all this, all that shit is
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.160]  going to end up in your weed that you're cleaning up. And once again, that's just as important as
[18:52.160 --> 18:57.840]  having a good flush. You don't want crap on your weed. You just spent 70 day flowering cycle. Plus,
[18:57.840 --> 19:01.440]  however long we took to veg that stuff. Plus if you're doing a Fino hunt, you're risking,
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.400]  you know, you got to tell which seeds are good or it's our outdoors. You know, that's,
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.720]  that's a big plant too. Yeah. Yeah. Put a lot of work and nervous nights into it
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.160]  and have a nice secure area while we're at it. I did not write that down, but have a nice secure
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.960]  area. And think about this. If you're making concentrates, every piece of dust and hair and
[19:20.960 --> 19:26.800]  particulate is going to end up in your concentrate somehow. Like even if it you're blasting butane
[19:26.800 --> 19:31.840]  over it, you're going to blast dog hair juice into your hash essentially. You know what I mean?
[19:31.840 --> 19:35.840]  I don't know technically what you're getting, but you know, that's what you're going to find in
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.880]  there. Uh, it's all going to end up in your concentrates. You're going to need to, in your
[19:40.880 --> 19:46.080]  trimming area, your, your work area, cover your table, get a plastic cloth. You guys use rubber
[19:46.080 --> 19:49.760]  gloves when you're handling your plants, when they're growing, when you're chopping them
[19:50.720 --> 19:57.600]  for God's sake, please. Uh, you're, you've seen how you do fingerprints when you commit a crime,
[19:57.600 --> 20:01.200]  you're doing that to your plants. You're leaving oils and hippie goop and human goop
[20:01.200 --> 20:06.800]  and Cheeto stains all over your plants. Where are some rubber gloves? Our oils actually, um,
[20:08.080 --> 20:13.280]  affect the plants for long-term storage and plants that have been handled with bare hands,
[20:14.240 --> 20:19.760]  break down faster in my experience. That makes sense. Yeah. Uh, I think a BHO dab, you can
[20:20.640 --> 20:26.800]  decarboxylize a BHO dab enough, uh, with your fingers. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think by rolling
[20:26.800 --> 20:31.760]  BHO around in your fingers, you can D D carbon enough to be edible. Like processed is Delta
[20:31.760 --> 20:38.080]  11 THC by your liver. That's how, well, that's like cannabinoids. Imagine. So if you can do that
[20:38.080 --> 20:42.560]  by rolling it in your hand, imagine what we can do to a trichome on a plant. You can rupture it,
[20:42.560 --> 20:47.600]  ruin it, kill it. You're leaving weird oils that are fighting. When you said decarboxylizing,
[20:47.600 --> 20:53.280]  I was thinking of de-waxing and all that stuff. Oh man. Yeah. We'll talk to somebody asked me,
[20:53.280 --> 20:57.760]  what is de-waxing? We need to get a hash maker over to say more technically what it is, but
[20:57.760 --> 21:04.000]  I'll explain it on a later episode. I want nothing to do with explaining that. So in your trim room,
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.240]  you should have comfy tables. You should have some good music. Uh, everyone's going to argue
[21:08.240 --> 21:14.400]  over the music. Sorry. Put on the agriculture podcast, episode one and hit play. Um, I actually
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.040]  like to put up standup comedian shows. Oh, that's a good idea. I listened to comedy. Uh, I honestly
[21:19.040 --> 21:24.080]  listened to a lot of Joey Coco Diaz and Joe Rogan. Yeah. And listen to a podcast when I'm trimming.
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.040]  Um, one of my favorite podcasts hasn't posted an episode in quite a while. I'm a little annoyed.
[21:29.040 --> 21:34.560]  What's up Adam L where's my new podcast, buddy. All right. I'm dabbed out. We got to keep on
[21:34.560 --> 21:40.160]  track here. We're getting into the show. I like it. Preparing the area, the area gloves, comfy
[21:40.160 --> 21:47.920]  chairs, good music. Uh, let's go back to dry area. Okay. Preparing that dry area. Yeah. Um,
[21:47.920 --> 21:56.320]  dehumidifier, humidifier, fans, possibly, possibly a fan or two, um, heater and or air conditioner.
[21:56.320 --> 22:01.760]  Possibly we're going to need to keep it, uh, between 60 and 70 degrees. You can go up to 75
[22:01.760 --> 22:04.640]  degrees if you need to, if it's, you know, in your bedroom or something, you're going to be
[22:04.640 --> 22:10.640]  all right. Don't stress, but keep in mind though, that heat is, um, one of the biggest enemies of a
[22:10.640 --> 22:17.120]  dry implants. Yes. Uh, and also you want it dark light. Uh, I know it sounds weird. You've had
[22:17.120 --> 22:21.440]  all kinds of light beaten down on your plants for months, but now we want it dark. We want those to
[22:21.440 --> 22:25.680]  stop growing and degrading. We want to kind of suspend the animation right where we are. It
[22:25.680 --> 22:31.280]  protects the, the trichromeds. Yes. Yes. We want to, we picked them at the right maturity. We
[22:31.280 --> 22:36.800]  don't want them going much further. We also want our humidity at 40% if we can, uh, not much more
[22:36.800 --> 22:41.280]  than that. If you go any lower, you're going to dry too quickly. If you go any higher, uh, of
[22:41.280 --> 22:45.680]  course you risk molds and it's going to take too damn long to dry. If you're in the dirty South,
[22:45.680 --> 22:50.960]  do the best again. Good luck. Yeah. Us in Colorado. It's funny that you say that because
[22:50.960 --> 22:54.400]  in the South you read stories. They're like, so when you harvest your weed, you got to dry it for
[22:54.400 --> 22:59.280]  20 days. And I'm like, what the fuck 20 days. And then you read in Colorado. You're like, so cut it
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.920]  down five days later. You got dried buds. You're like, Oh yeah, they must be, must be in Colorado
[23:03.920 --> 23:09.040]  in February. It really varies from region to region. And even like what side of the state
[23:09.040 --> 23:14.800]  you're on humans dry out in Colorado. Yeah. Yeah. So, so you got your fan, you got your dehumidifier,
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.880]  your humidifier. Try to have, if you can afford it, if you can do it, put a carbon filter and a
[23:18.880 --> 23:25.040]  blower in your drying room. Yeah. Um, harvesting plants stink very much. Sorry guys. I'm choking
[23:25.040 --> 23:31.120]  on a dab over here. Uh, harvesting plants, your neighbors will smell it 10 times more than you.
[23:31.120 --> 23:36.240]  You've been around them every day. You're so used to it. You're so comfortable with it. Uh, I've had
[23:36.240 --> 23:40.800]  plants. Uh, I had just gotten done trimming and didn't have any plants on me. And somebody came
[23:40.800 --> 23:44.080]  over and they're like, damn dude, I can smell your plants from the garage. And I was like,
[23:44.080 --> 23:50.080]  I don't even have plants at this house. What's going on? It's just me reeking of trim. I've had
[23:50.160 --> 23:54.880]  lady in loaf and jug always tells me I smell good. And I'm like, I'm just coming home from work.
[23:56.160 --> 24:00.880]  The people at Lowe's know what I do. They're buying weird shit smelling like dank all the time.
[24:01.440 --> 24:06.560]  Restaurant owners always love me. I know he's hungry. So they got that carbon filter. Also,
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.480]  you need a hygrometer that just tells you what the humidity is and a thermometer. They sell a
[24:10.480 --> 24:16.160]  great one at hygro indoor growing supplies. Yes. Yes. Also, that is something you can get at Walmart
[24:16.160 --> 24:23.040]  anywhere in the nation. Lowe's has a remote control, a thermometer, hygrometers, you can set
[24:23.040 --> 24:26.800]  the unit in the room and then you can carry the thing around with you. And whenever you're curious,
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.840]  you look at the thing and it tells you, you don't have to run to the grow room and look.
[24:29.840 --> 24:39.440]  My dad has one. Um, it has a chick on it. Um, and, uh, he, he seriously got this at Lowe's or Walmart.
[24:39.440 --> 24:45.120]  Um, but when it's hot, she's in a bikini and when it's cold, she's in a coat and a scarf and
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.480]  everything all bundled up. So there he is. That's a great, I can see your dad smiling at that one.
[24:52.560 --> 24:58.640]  I'm going to put more heat on your mic. There we go. All right. So, uh, we've got, yeah, the road,
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.560]  the rooms are looking good. We've got a place to harvest. We got a place to dry. Now you need a
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.720]  spot to hang your buds or your whole plants, depending on how you want to do it. We'll talk
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.080]  about that in a minute. Uh, set up a hanging space with plenty of space between your plants.
[25:12.160 --> 25:15.920]  If you have a small crop, you can use a coat hanger, put two plants on one coat hanger. If
[25:15.920 --> 25:21.760]  they're little like three gallon pot kind of guys, if you've got a five gallon pot, hopefully you'd
[25:21.760 --> 25:26.160]  made enough pots where you need a one coat hanger per plant, any bigger than that, we're going to
[25:26.160 --> 25:32.080]  need little hanging lines from the ceiling. Uh, I use hemp twine and freaking hooks and just put
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.480]  hooks in each end of the wall and run some twine across. Some of you guys may not have space.
[25:36.480 --> 25:41.920]  Fishing line works good too. Yeah. Fishing line is perfect. Uh, any kind of string to hang it up.
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.400]  You know, I've seen guys take chicken wire and make a big cylinder out of it. And that way you
[25:46.400 --> 25:50.880]  got a bunch of hanging spaces at different layers. That's basically what we do at the farm.
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.240]  Okay. Tomato cages work great too. Yeah. Recycle that tomato cage. Uh, you know,
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.000]  a long time ago I harvested a crop and dried it in the hydro hut that the crop grew in.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.600]  Just took out the light, flip the crop, hung it upside down, right inside there. Kept all
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.040]  the blowers going, kept the carbon filter going. Beautiful crop. That's awesome. Worked very well.
[26:11.040 --> 26:14.560]  I wish I had the space to be able to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice.
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.720]  Avoid the drying racks if at all possible. Yeah. A lot of people were talking about those online
[26:22.720 --> 26:26.320]  the other day when I was talking about drying, uh, those put a dent in your, they make a flat
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.640]  side on your weed. They make it take taste longer. Uh, when you start squishing the bud together like
[26:30.640 --> 26:34.960]  that, you're messing up your trichomes and your flavors. You're trapping in air, trapping in
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.520]  chlorophyll, you're trapping in moisture, which is what we try to get out. Raise chance of mold.
[26:40.320 --> 26:49.440]  Um, it centralizes a whole bunch of humidity. Um, and I've always felt the mesh damages the bud.
[26:49.440 --> 26:52.960]  Yeah. Just shaking around and stuff like that. Trying to poke through the mash and then you
[26:52.960 --> 26:56.800]  always end up with, I have to put, uh, something underneath those to catch all the stuff that
[26:56.800 --> 27:00.720]  falls out. There's so much that falls off. I always wonder what should I do with this?
[27:01.360 --> 27:05.600]  Although that was a few years ago. I know what to do with it now. I know. But I quit using those.
[27:06.560 --> 27:09.920]  I was like, you make BH. I'm not sure where you came from.
[27:10.720 --> 27:18.400]  Um, it is useful for if you have gigantic plants, um, all the, the LARF and the little buds that you
[27:19.760 --> 27:25.040]  end up with inadvertently, you know, so always seems like you have a pile of that stuff, no
[27:25.040 --> 27:29.360]  matter how hard you try to fight it. Don't be mad if you chop a bud in half on your first
[27:29.360 --> 27:33.040]  trim session either. That happens. That always happens occasionally.
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.640]  All right. So we've got the rooms built up or wearing rubber gloves. Um, let's see,
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.320]  have everything done before you chop down. Don't be scrambling around.
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.680]  Be relaxed. This is really when this I've seen a lot of good crops go right up to the point where
[27:51.680 --> 27:56.080]  it's time to put scissors to them. And that's when somebody fucked them up or right after you put
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.760]  scissors to it and trimmed it and then put it all on a Tupperware while it was wet or hung it out
[27:59.760 --> 28:06.080]  too long to dry. Like this is where it counts. You guys, if you've spent 60 days, 70 days on a
[28:06.080 --> 28:11.040]  flowering crop, let's do the harvest. Right. This is where, this is where, this is where the patients
[28:11.040 --> 28:18.480]  are. This is where the money happens. My aunt in a highly illegal state grew a crop when I was
[28:18.480 --> 28:25.120]  younger. Um, and she didn't know how to handle any of this. And of course there was no information.
[28:25.120 --> 28:31.840]  This was the eighties. Um, she stuck it in a black trash bag and then hung it in her basement.
[28:31.840 --> 28:38.320]  And there were swamps in the area of the country she lived in and, uh, or not her basement, but
[28:38.320 --> 28:45.600]  her attic. Um, and needless to say, uh, it created a whole bunch of mold. That sounds disgusting.
[28:45.600 --> 28:52.240]  Yeah. A horrible waste of a summer's work, especially in this locale. Oh yeah. And time
[28:52.400 --> 28:59.120]  era. Risk your life for moldy buds. Terrible. She was a crazy one. So be prepared. Be a boy scout
[28:59.120 --> 29:02.080]  when it comes to growing your crop. You should always be thinking two weeks ahead in your pot
[29:02.080 --> 29:06.800]  plants because anything you do today, you're not going to see it for seven to 10 days. Probably
[29:06.800 --> 29:13.200]  anything you've messed up on in the season. Uh, here's your chance to, you know, make a little
[29:13.200 --> 29:20.400]  right of it. That's a good point. Yeah. Get on it. So I guess this is the time where we are going to
[29:20.400 --> 29:27.440]  get the plants and harvest them, right? Yeah. Okay. Uh, we should also branch out to, uh,
[29:27.440 --> 29:31.680]  dry trim and wet trim a little bit before we get too far. Uh, the way I, I'm going to talk about
[29:31.680 --> 29:35.520]  how I harvest a plant. I'm going to hypothetically have a three gallon pot. I'm going to drag that
[29:35.520 --> 29:42.080]  three gallon pot with my three foot tall pot plant over to a nice area where I've got plenty of space.
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.760]  I'm just going to chop the whole plant. And the way that I do it, I chopped the plant,
[29:46.480 --> 29:51.360]  uh, just, just above where the first nodes pop out so that I don't have a lot of stick hanging
[29:51.360 --> 29:57.360]  off the edge, chop that boom. It's unnecessary water, flip the plant upside down. I use a fuzzy
[29:57.360 --> 30:01.280]  stick. It looks like a pipe cleaner. Just wrap that bitch right around those bottom two nodes
[30:01.280 --> 30:04.720]  so that I got a nice hanger and I leave some hanging off. And then I tied that under wherever
[30:04.720 --> 30:08.160]  it's going to hang from different situations at this point, I hang in different areas.
[30:08.160 --> 30:12.240]  So we'll say I'm using my main dry room. Uh, just hang it from the dry line that hangs up there.
[30:12.240 --> 30:17.760]  Boom. It's hanging in there. I myself dry trim. So I've got a plant that's been flushed, de-leafed.
[30:18.480 --> 30:22.800]  Um, my rooms are clean. Everything's going properly. Now I've just got this giant wet
[30:22.800 --> 30:28.160]  plant that is mostly little leaves and just donkey dick buds hanging upside down in my dry room.
[30:28.720 --> 30:34.960]  The temps are perfect. So now if we were going to wet trim, this is where a wet trim and dry trim
[30:34.960 --> 30:39.200]  would branch off a little bit, right? Yeah, I believe so. Okay. I just want to keep everybody
[30:39.200 --> 30:43.120]  on the same page. Sometimes we, uh, we go too fast because we've done all this. And sometimes
[30:43.120 --> 30:48.400]  people are like, you skipped like four days worth of growth. So I just want to keep it all. So if
[30:48.400 --> 30:52.800]  you're going to wet trim, the difference between wet trim and dry trim is obviously you let your
[30:52.800 --> 30:56.400]  plants dry. If you're going to dry trim and then you get in there and take the leaves off wet trim,
[30:56.400 --> 30:59.600]  you would do it right now. You've cut the plant down. You got to hang it up. Now it's time to get
[30:59.600 --> 31:03.840]  in there and chop everything off. You trim it into the bud. That's going to be smoked at this point.
[31:03.840 --> 31:08.480]  Right. Uh, you don't have to go as close as you look like you want to, because those little leaves
[31:08.480 --> 31:12.400]  are going to shrink up into the bud a little, but still do a hell of a good job getting in there.
[31:13.600 --> 31:17.600]  Jesse said earlier, I definitely prefer dry trimming. Jesse and I agree that we say dry
[31:17.600 --> 31:21.360]  trimming. We agreed earlier that some of those Southern States we're talking about with a lot
[31:21.360 --> 31:26.000]  of humidity, you guys may want to wet trim because you need to get those leaves off of there and kind
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.680]  of speed up that dry process here in Colorado. There's not a lot of humidity. Sometimes it gets
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.160]  super dry. We're trying to slow it down. We need to slow it down. We leave those leaves on. So
[31:36.160 --> 31:41.200]  we're going to talk about mostly about dry trimming. This is what trim is. Basically,
[31:41.920 --> 31:47.440]  I cut the buds off of the sticks to where I have a good hand size bud, um, or in rubber gloves. I
[31:47.440 --> 31:51.840]  try to hold on to just a stem. And then I spin that bud in my hand and just slowly clip off all
[31:51.840 --> 31:57.120]  of the leaves. You can trim it to your preference. If it's going to you, uh, if you're trying to put
[31:57.120 --> 32:00.720]  it to market, you got to trim that shit close. It's got to look good. Take off. If there's not
[32:00.720 --> 32:05.360]  a lot of trichome on that leaf, take it off. If that leaf is sticking out, take it off. We don't,
[32:05.360 --> 32:10.560]  we're not leaf heads. We're pot heads. We want to smoke pot, not leaves. So that's basically
[32:10.560 --> 32:15.520]  wet trim. I have some patients that they don't want it trimmed at all with their old school.
[32:15.520 --> 32:18.960]  So, uh, so I guess you should leave it on the sticks. Don't, I should say that. Leave it kind
[32:18.960 --> 32:23.200]  of on the sticks. Don't cut it into two smaller parts because you need a way to hang it. Uh,
[32:23.200 --> 32:26.880]  you know how the branch is a branch and then there's a little node coming off where your buds
[32:26.880 --> 32:30.960]  grow. Save one of those little branch parts as a little hook. And then you can hang that in your
[32:30.960 --> 32:34.160]  dry room because after you get done trimming these buds, you want to hang them up so they
[32:34.160 --> 32:39.920]  don't get a flat spot in your cure rack or your dry rack. You want them hanging. Uh, so trim them
[32:39.920 --> 32:45.840]  up, hang them up and then let those dry. Uh, they, those wet buds need to dry after they've been
[32:45.840 --> 32:51.360]  trimmed until you grab them and bend the stick and the stick should pop and snap. It should just go
[32:51.360 --> 32:56.160]  crack right on you. And that'll be obvious when it happens. So depending on where you are,
[32:56.160 --> 33:01.600]  that should take between five to maybe 15 days, just depending on your location.
[33:01.600 --> 33:08.960]  And they dry from the outside in. So, um, where the fuck I'm stoned. Uh, we're on what trim is
[33:08.960 --> 33:13.200]  still right. Yeah. Yeah. Talking a little about, so like, I mean the outside of the bud is going
[33:13.200 --> 33:20.080]  to be dry before the entire bud is actually dry. Right. Don't, don't, uh, you know, get too happy
[33:20.080 --> 33:26.160]  and jump the gun there. Yeah. It's really going to make a huge difference. Uh, just slightly wet
[33:26.160 --> 33:33.360]  buds to dry buds to, uh, properly cured buds. This little, so Jesse's learning how to use a
[33:33.360 --> 33:41.440]  straw here on the podcast. The, the cough wasn't that impressive. The look on his face was like,
[33:41.440 --> 33:48.160]  did I just cough from a straw? Yeah, you did bro. Yeah. All right. Uh, yeah. Wet trim. I don't do
[33:48.160 --> 33:53.280]  that. So let's talk about dry trim. Uh, guys, dry trim. I prefer it. It's easier. Uh, dry trim.
[33:53.360 --> 33:57.600]  You're going to hang, I hang the whole plant. I've heard, uh, people chopping the brand. I
[33:57.600 --> 34:00.880]  grow and I'm talking about a three gallon pot here. So I'd hang the whole plant. Some people
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.760]  chop it into smaller pieces. Uh, if you can get it into just branches, that's cool. I like to let
[34:05.760 --> 34:10.320]  the whole thing hang. I feel like it dries up just the right speed here just because of where we are
[34:10.320 --> 34:15.680]  for, for indoor plants. I totally agree. All right. So you're growing those big outdoor plants.
[34:15.680 --> 34:20.400]  You've got to chop them into smaller parts. Yeah. Outdoor plants with three levels of cages around
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.800]  them. This is not really an option. You can't even get out of the cage. And also I told somebody
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.400]  to cut down the whole plant and they said, I grow a Scrog. So you guys are going to have to cut out
[34:28.400 --> 34:32.000]  branches. So we'll just go with this. We'll go. We've got a bunch of branches now. Uh, we're
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.680]  cutting off one branch at a time. We hang those, they dry, uh, however long it takes just kind of
[34:37.680 --> 34:44.080]  sort of similar to the wet trim. We're going to let them hang until right, right before they snap.
[34:44.080 --> 34:48.480]  When that first part snaps. Now it's time to get to work because your stuff's going to dry slowly
[34:48.560 --> 34:51.760]  and you're going to catch up. You're going to get a little behind in trimming, but you'll catch up.
[34:51.760 --> 34:55.680]  Yeah. Especially if you got a lot of work to do. Hopefully you got a lot of work to do. Yeah. Had
[34:55.680 --> 35:00.720]  that thousand watt light. Oh yeah. Yeah. And the 52 ounces we're trying to grow outside.
[35:03.600 --> 35:07.520]  One ounce per week is all we need. That's a flashback to an old episode. Yeah. I hope you
[35:07.520 --> 35:11.920]  guys remember that. Cause I got where we're headed. Uh, so we got these dried plants. You chop,
[35:11.920 --> 35:15.120]  you chop your plants down. You hung on me, let them dry. Now you've cut off a stick,
[35:15.680 --> 35:20.080]  go to your drying area and you got your stick, uh, pretty much just take your thumbs and just
[35:20.080 --> 35:24.880]  knock those little dried leaves right off. Uh, put them, get a little container and have that,
[35:24.880 --> 35:27.760]  where you can just knock the leaves right into that container. Cause you're going to make
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.080]  some sort of concentrates out of that hopefully, or food or something with your gloves on,
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.440]  with your gloves on, keep your gloves on, please. I don't want to eat your skin flakes
[35:35.440 --> 35:41.200]  and your fingernail dirt. So you got these buds and I kind of hold it or no, I kind of,
[35:41.200 --> 35:45.120]  I'm just picturing the way I do it. It looks like I'm playing Nintendo. I got my thumbs just going
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.360]  and I'm just knocking leaves off. It looks like he's playing snake on a Nokia phone. Yeah. It
[35:51.360 --> 35:54.400]  looks like you're texting on the iPhone. That's pretty much what you're doing. You're just holding
[35:54.400 --> 35:57.840]  that thing and just knock the leaves off. You don't even have to, you can see what you want
[35:57.840 --> 36:01.920]  to take off once it's dry. So trim it to your preference. His little triangle leaves that stick
[36:01.920 --> 36:04.640]  out. I'm actually trimming this bud that's sitting on the table with my fingers, these little triangle
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.240]  leaves. You can just pluck those right off and then I pluck that off and you can see where the
[36:08.240 --> 36:16.000]  bud is and where the leaf ends if you've done it right. I use scissors, but it's the exact same
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.320]  process. Some strains, Girl Scout cookies and Yeti, no scissors necessary. You just roll that
[36:22.320 --> 36:27.440]  around in your hand and those dried leaves fall right off. Yeah. And then, so these dried nuggets,
[36:27.440 --> 36:32.240]  they're pretty much dry. I throw those in a bin and then when I'm done, I jar them up. That's
[36:32.240 --> 36:37.840]  kind of how, where the cure process starts for both of these plants. Once those sticks are snapping
[36:37.840 --> 36:43.360]  on your wet trim, take the leaves off, throw it in a bin and they're ready to go into jars when
[36:43.360 --> 36:47.680]  you're done trimming everything. The dry trim, now that you've knocked the leaves off, you got
[36:47.680 --> 36:52.240]  that in a bin. Now we're ready to pretty much go into jars and that's kind of where the curing
[36:52.240 --> 36:57.840]  process would start, don't you think? Yeah. Have we skipped anything? I'm sure we have, but I'm
[36:57.840 --> 37:04.800]  really stoned. Me too. Do we want to get into curing on this episode or do we, we've got 35,
[37:04.800 --> 37:10.000]  36 minutes. Do we want to get into the cure or do we want to save that for another time?
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.360]  Yeah, let's do a little homework on that. All right, guys, we're going to wrap it up. I want
[37:13.360 --> 37:16.800]  to thank Jesse for coming. We're going to hang out and leave the mics on for a couple of minutes.
[37:16.800 --> 37:25.500]  You got anything you want to say while we're on there? Oh yeah, yeah. Hi, Bern. I'll even
[37:25.500 --> 37:28.700]  admit it that I had to have been told that. Trying to keep you out of trouble. Hi, Bern.
[37:28.700 --> 37:35.100]  We both want to say what's up. The story looks great. I have this, nevermind, I'm not even going
[37:35.100 --> 37:38.860]  to explain it on the air. Attention deficit disorder. Is that what you're going to talk
[37:38.860 --> 37:45.900]  about? No, no. It's stuck in the old school. I don't like talking about certain things,
[37:45.900 --> 37:51.420]  but there's no reason not to. So I see. Yeah. You try to keep, you got to keep the family life and
[37:51.420 --> 37:56.540]  the podcast life separate. For sure. I understand. Understandable. We're saying hi to the lady at the
[37:56.540 --> 38:02.780]  hydro store. Hi lady at the hydro store. Hi baby. Dude, really, thanks for coming. You make the
[38:02.780 --> 38:06.220]  shows, people listen when you come, they feel like you're an authority and you remind me of
[38:06.220 --> 38:12.300]  shit that I would skip. Wow. That cracks me up. I told you we're getting close to 1500 listeners
[38:12.300 --> 38:16.540]  per episode. That's crazy. Isn't that crazy? That's crazy. This little podcast from this
[38:16.540 --> 38:19.820]  little town is actually making a difference. We're helping people make quality medicine,
[38:19.820 --> 38:24.700]  dude. And that's what my goal was. What's up? Oh, here's something I want to talk about. I like it.
[38:24.700 --> 38:28.700]  I'm going to get a dab going. Dude, would you pass me the new dabs of golden goat? For sure.
[38:28.700 --> 38:32.940]  The other paper. Oh yeah. That one. There you go. Dude, this is, these dabs are the craziest
[38:32.940 --> 38:37.260]  looking dabs. He said he tipped it when he was putting it onto the thing. So it's got this ripple
[38:37.260 --> 38:44.620]  look to it. It's really neat. It looks like a, like the floor of a golden pool or some shit.
[38:44.620 --> 38:51.260]  Yeah. It looks like a, I can see a rapper wearing a shirt with this print on it. Like it's got like
[38:51.260 --> 38:55.020]  a slick Rick sort of look to it. I could see a couple of looks staring at that for a couple of
[38:55.020 --> 39:00.700]  hours on that. You know, so some kind of, some kind of weird things. Yeah. Sure. Not to garden
[39:00.700 --> 39:05.500]  of Weeden. We're talking about your hash bro. It's dank. Good work. What's up homies. Big love
[39:05.500 --> 39:10.940]  to everybody at the garden of Weeden. Um, I need to give, while I'm thinking about it, a special,
[39:10.940 --> 39:16.700]  special, super shout out to my friend, Doug Benson and also comedy works. Uh, we had the time of our
[39:16.700 --> 39:22.620]  lives Monday night. I don't want to brag too much, but look at, uh, the Facebook pages and the
[39:22.620 --> 39:26.300]  Instagrams and the Twitters. There's like a hundred pictures of me smoking and dabbing with
[39:26.300 --> 39:32.940]  Doug Benson. Oh, you guys don't even know the stories you can't tell. So it's cool. Cool as hell.
[39:33.580 --> 39:38.380]  Hey, a cuss jar. That's something you need to bring up. Look, I even just stopped myself from
[39:38.380 --> 39:43.500]  saying fuck cuss jar. This is only a rule that applies to me, but if the guests want to participate,
[39:43.500 --> 39:47.580]  they can. The cuss jar. If I say the F word, the F word is the only one that counts in this cuss
[39:47.580 --> 39:52.300]  jar. Uh, if I say the F word, you guys tweet me and remind me every time I say it on the podcast,
[39:52.300 --> 39:56.700]  starting on episode 30, that's this show. Don't go back in time and cost me money.
[39:56.700 --> 40:01.580]  Every time from now forward that I say the F word on a show, it costs me a dollar. Okay. After a few
[40:01.580 --> 40:05.980]  episodes, if I quit saying, if I don't quit saying the F word, I will increase my donation amount.
[40:05.980 --> 40:09.900]  I'll crank it up to $5. And then after I'm not committing to any amount of episodes, I want to
[40:09.900 --> 40:13.820]  see how I do. Cause if I do the worst I do, the more money I have to pay, cause it'll hurt me more.
[40:13.820 --> 40:18.860]  A dollar doesn't hurt my feelings, but it reminds me $5. You go, damn, that was $5, 10 bucks. You
[40:18.860 --> 40:24.300]  start going, this is getting expensive. So we're going to increase it slowly. I have a charity,
[40:24.300 --> 40:28.940]  um, that I have in mind that I will tell you who it is. It's a friend on Instagram. He, we had a
[40:28.940 --> 40:33.100]  long conversation and he does deserve the donations. It's not an organization. It's actually a person
[40:33.100 --> 40:38.140]  who needs help. Uh, it's a sick child. So we will help that kid out. Every time I say the F word,
[40:38.140 --> 40:41.740]  here's a buck for you. What the fuck? There we go. You got a dollar coming your way just to get
[40:41.740 --> 40:47.420]  it started. That makes me want to make you cuss. Right? That was kind of a smart ass way to do it,
[40:47.660 --> 40:51.260]  but it cost me a dollar and it was well worth it. I get to send this guy a dollar for a sick child.
[40:51.260 --> 40:55.660]  Fuck yeah. There you go. I'll still occasionally see us. So, and we're going to start charging the
[40:55.660 --> 41:00.060]  guests a dollar too, just for that one. That doesn't count. You can say that one all you want.
[41:00.060 --> 41:05.660]  Fuck yeah. We're kind of rambling. I got, I got a big dab here. I owe a huge shout out to my man,
[41:05.660 --> 41:11.900]  task rock. I really appreciate my brand new blue, highly educated carb cap. Isn't that stylish bro?
[41:11.900 --> 41:18.380]  Fuck yeah. It's blue. I didn't mean to do that actually. So, uh, uh, I'm going to wrap up this
[41:18.380 --> 41:22.940]  part right now. We're going to leave. All right guys, that pretty much wraps up episode 30. Mostly
[41:22.940 --> 41:27.260]  wraps up the outdoor grow lessons. I want to send a huge thank you to Jesse for taking time out of
[41:27.260 --> 41:31.180]  his grow schedule to come and help us out. It seems like the listeners really appreciate that.
[41:31.180 --> 41:36.060]  So much respect and much love to Jesse. Make sure you guys follow him. It's at jessegrowsog
[41:36.060 --> 41:41.420]  on Twitter and jessegrows on Instagram. Give him a follow. We'll appreciate that. Now that the show
[41:41.500 --> 41:45.900]  is over, please go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search for I grow culture, find the review
[41:45.900 --> 41:49.980]  section and give me a five-star rating. After that type in a comment, let me know what you think of
[41:49.980 --> 41:54.780]  the show and I will read your comments on a future episode. I'll also read all the Stitcher comments.
[41:54.780 --> 41:59.420]  Stitcher just recently updated and it is a lot easier for me to find the comments. So go to
[41:59.420 --> 42:03.260]  Stitcher, leave your comments there, give me a five-star review and I will read your comments
[42:03.260 --> 42:07.420]  from Stitcher as well. Uh, the reason I like good reviews and good ratings is because that helps us
[42:07.420 --> 42:12.620]  move up in the ranks, which just gets us, which gets us seen by more listeners, which gets more
[42:12.620 --> 42:18.380]  people growing quality product, which gets less shit product out on the street. So we can improve
[42:18.380 --> 42:22.940]  everybody's garden by making the podcast a little more popular. Don't forget that the show is
[42:22.940 --> 42:29.420]  available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode is archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[42:30.700 --> 42:34.540]  I want to give a big, huge shout out to my ninja Spence. I owe a huge shout out to my buddy,
[42:34.540 --> 42:38.940]  Doug Benson. Shout out to the crew at Comedy Works. Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[42:38.940 --> 42:42.140]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
