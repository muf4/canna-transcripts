[00:10.940 --> 00:21.580]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 152 of the Grow From
[00:21.580 --> 00:26.100]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.100 --> 00:29.860]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:29.860 --> 00:33.780]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.780 --> 00:39.260]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.260 --> 00:42.660]  host, my friends. Call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:42.660 --> 00:46.140]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.140 --> 00:51.140]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic
[00:51.140 --> 00:55.940]  Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, we're going to talk a little bit
[00:55.940 --> 01:00.260]  about revegging and reverting your plants. Some people like to take their plants all
[01:00.260 --> 01:04.820]  the way through the flowering phase and then return them back to veg and reuse those same
[01:04.820 --> 01:08.940]  plants. So we will talk a little bit about that later in this episode. Before I get that
[01:08.940 --> 01:12.140]  far, I want to talk about some cool shit that I got to do this week. I kind of teased this
[01:12.140 --> 01:16.900]  on a past episode. I got to take a good friend up to Colorado Springs on Thursday and we
[01:16.900 --> 01:21.540]  saw Jeff Tate, Emma Arnold, and some other opening comedians. My friend Ben Verbeck was
[01:21.540 --> 01:26.060]  an opening comedian up at the Dab Lounge. They did their Good Cop, Bad Cop comedy show.
[01:26.060 --> 01:29.580]  It was a great time. I got to hang out with Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold and they treated
[01:29.580 --> 01:33.780]  me like a rock star. I've seen Jeff Tate several times. That was my first time meeting Emma
[01:33.780 --> 01:38.660]  Arnold. I've seen Jeff Tate several times with Doug Benson. So him and I have become
[01:38.660 --> 01:43.020]  comfortable with each other. He has recently become a pot smoker. He has made the switch
[01:43.020 --> 01:47.780]  from alcohol to cannabis. So excited about that. I got to see Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold
[01:47.780 --> 01:53.740]  do some comedy. Ben Verbeck opened the show. Another guy whose name has left my head. I
[01:53.740 --> 01:59.100]  knew his name until right now. That guy went on second. And then Emma Arnold went on and
[01:59.100 --> 02:03.580]  her set was great. Then Jeff Tate went on. He did a comedy set. And then toward the end
[02:03.580 --> 02:08.300]  of his standup routine, he said, I'm going to light this joint and start smoking. And
[02:08.460 --> 02:12.660]  then at some point in this comedy show, I'm going to become too high to continue doing
[02:12.660 --> 02:17.740]  standup. And so he lit his joint and he kept doing his bit. And then at some point he obviously
[02:17.740 --> 02:20.900]  got too high and he said, thanks and walked off the stage. That was pretty cool to see.
[02:20.900 --> 02:25.580]  It was fun to watch. That was a good experience. Friday, I took the night off, got some rest,
[02:25.580 --> 02:31.060]  hung out a little bit. Saturday and Sunday, we went to Denver and I saw my favorite band.
[02:31.060 --> 02:36.180]  My favorite band is Fish. I saw Fish at the Dick's Sporting Goods Arena Stadium, whatever
[02:36.180 --> 02:41.500]  it is, a gigantic big ass soccer field. Saw Fish there. It was sold out. All three nights
[02:41.500 --> 02:44.660]  were sold out. If you did not have tickets, it was a challenge getting tickets. I'm lucky
[02:44.660 --> 02:50.140]  I got into that one. Man, Fish was awesome. Played some of my favorite songs. They played
[02:50.140 --> 02:54.740]  a really amazing version of a song called Maze. They played Tube, played some great,
[02:54.740 --> 03:00.180]  great music. We had a great time. Really good show. It was a good time. Amazing evening.
[03:00.180 --> 03:04.860]  Safe drive, which was great because it was a busy holiday weekend. Monday morning, we
[03:04.860 --> 03:09.020]  head back up to Denver. We get some food up in Denver. Then we got to see Doug Benson
[03:09.020 --> 03:14.620]  at the Comedy Works. One of my favorite podcasts is the Doug Loves Movies podcast. I got to
[03:14.620 --> 03:19.600]  see Doug Benson, joined once again by his friends Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold, and also
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.620]  a guy named Trey Galeon joined them for the Doug Loves Movies taping at Comedy Works.
[03:25.620 --> 03:29.980]  Of course, I got to hang out for that one. I was front row. Big shout out to my buddy
[03:29.980 --> 03:34.420]  Baker for getting me front row all the time at Comedy Works. I appreciate that. It was
[03:34.420 --> 03:39.980]  a great taping, you guys. I suggest that you listen to the Denver show of Doug Loves
[03:39.980 --> 03:43.460]  Movies. It is out now. By the time this podcast comes out, that will be out. Make sure you
[03:43.460 --> 03:47.860]  check it out. It's a great podcast, Doug Loves Movies. If you're listening to this podcast,
[03:47.860 --> 03:51.100]  you have access to Doug Loves Movies. Check it out. It's one of my favorite shows. I got
[03:51.100 --> 03:56.180]  to see the live taping. Great time. At the end of the podcast taping, we were all hanging
[03:56.180 --> 03:59.820]  outside in the alley smoking because Doug and his friends love to come and just smoke
[03:59.820 --> 04:05.340]  out with everybody. I made friends with Trey Galeon almost instantly. That guy and I are
[04:05.340 --> 04:10.260]  homies now. We'll be friends for life. Before I left, all four of the comedians were standing
[04:10.260 --> 04:13.000]  there and I said, hey, you guys, it means a lot to me that you come and do comedy because
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.420]  comedy is super important to me. Thank you, guys. They all sincerely felt my thanks. That
[04:18.420 --> 04:22.260]  was cool to see all four of their faces like, holy shit, we made this dude's day. That was
[04:22.260 --> 04:25.460]  pretty cool. That was my weekend, you guys. I got a bunch of good comedy, a whole bunch
[04:25.460 --> 04:29.180]  of good music. Once again, shout out to my buddy Baker. Shout out to Ben Verbeck from
[04:29.180 --> 04:33.460]  the Dab Lounge. Shout out to the Dab Lounge in Colorado Springs. Big, huge shout outs
[04:33.460 --> 04:39.300]  to Emma Arnold, Jeff Tate, Trey Galeon, Doug Benson, and everyone at Comedy Works. Also,
[04:39.300 --> 04:46.340]  shout out to Fish and my fishing buddies. That was fun. I appreciate that. Where are
[04:46.340 --> 04:49.700]  we going to go from here? Let's talk about a grow update. I've got a grow update. Everybody
[04:49.700 --> 04:52.980]  that's been listening to the show knows that I've been working on a breeding project. I've
[04:52.980 --> 04:57.660]  got one light with a very small breeding project happening in there. The other day, I went
[04:57.660 --> 05:01.380]  in there and pulled out the male plant. I collected a little bit of pollen from him.
[05:01.380 --> 05:05.340]  Then I cut the plant down. Of course, I hosed myself down with a good shower because I don't
[05:05.340 --> 05:09.940]  want to get that pollen everywhere. Now, the male plant is out of the room. I had one arise
[05:09.940 --> 05:17.300]  male. That plant has dropped his pollen and he is now gone. There are five arise female
[05:17.300 --> 05:22.060]  types. There are number two, number four, no, it's number four, number five, number
[05:22.060 --> 05:28.300]  seven, number eight, and then one that was labeled E. E was the remaining phenotype from
[05:28.300 --> 05:32.100]  another pheno hunt that I liked a lot. E has been around for a minute. E is the arise that
[05:32.100 --> 05:36.740]  you see a lot of pictures of. The other ones are really good competitors that have great
[05:36.740 --> 05:41.980]  traits. I've got those five female phenotypes in there. I have one golden goat, one grateful
[05:41.980 --> 05:47.740]  dog, one lemon skunk. All of those are females in there. There are eight females that have
[05:47.740 --> 05:53.220]  all been pollinated by this one male. They are currently 40 days into flower. It's been
[05:53.220 --> 05:59.340]  about 25 days since pollination. I've still got probably 20 to 30 days before I can harvest
[05:59.340 --> 06:04.500]  these plants and the seeds will be ready. Currently, the seeds are visible. You can
[06:04.500 --> 06:10.940]  see that the pollen worked. These plants took the pollen. They're seeded now. They're developing
[06:10.940 --> 06:16.260]  nicely. I like to see what's going on. The other day, I grabbed a bottom bud and just
[06:16.260 --> 06:20.380]  pinched one of the seeds out of it. They're white still, but they are starting to develop
[06:20.380 --> 06:24.860]  an embryo inside. The shells are getting a little bit hard, but they are still white.
[06:24.860 --> 06:28.740]  They taste weird also, if you're curious. They're not quite ready yet. Still got a little
[06:28.740 --> 06:33.940]  ways to go. When they're ready, my plan is to let them go until those seeds are really
[06:33.940 --> 06:38.500]  well done. Then I'm going to cut down each plant and label each plant very carefully
[06:38.500 --> 06:43.060]  as to what it is. I will hang each plant in its own area with a bowl underneath it so
[06:43.060 --> 06:46.300]  that if a seed does fall out, I'll catch it. Actually, you guys, I'm a drummer. I'm
[06:46.300 --> 06:50.860]  going to use a drum head. Flip the drum head upside down, put it underneath each plant
[06:50.860 --> 06:54.940]  so that if a seed falls out, it lands in the drum head, it doesn't go anywhere. Then once
[06:54.940 --> 07:00.060]  they dry, I will take each plant individually and crush it up into probably a Tupperware
[07:00.060 --> 07:04.540]  dish. I'll take off the fan leaves and I'll crunch it up. All the buds will get just hand
[07:04.540 --> 07:08.140]  ground like I'm going to roll joints. Then all the seeds will fall out at that point.
[07:08.140 --> 07:12.000]  I'll pull out all the seeds. I'll separate them. I'll jar them up. I'll label them as
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.920]  to which phenotype that is, like a Rise, F2, it'll be a Rise 5, F2, a Rise 7, F2, whatever
[07:18.920 --> 07:22.440]  plant it comes from, I'll make sure it's labeled. Then I'm going to grow a bunch of those and
[07:22.440 --> 07:25.560]  some of my friends are going to grow a bunch of those. I'm going to see which Arise phenotypes
[07:25.560 --> 07:29.780]  I want to continue breeding with. Then we'll see if this Golden Goat, the Grateful Dog
[07:29.780 --> 07:33.440]  and Lemon Skunk, we'll see if they do anything. That's my goal. I want to make some new stuff.
[07:33.440 --> 07:37.160]  I want to stabilize this Arise a little bit. My goal is actually in the long run to take
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.840]  this Arise all the way to F5. That's what I would like to do. That will take me a couple
[07:42.840 --> 07:46.080]  of years, probably two more years, maybe three more years to get it there depending on how
[07:46.080 --> 07:51.480]  selection goes, depending on how stubborn I am, depending on what the F2s and F3s show
[07:51.480 --> 07:55.600]  me. That's my breeding update, you guys. I appreciate you guys sticking around for the
[07:55.600 --> 07:59.240]  breeding updates with me. If you have any questions on my breeding project, please send
[07:59.240 --> 08:04.000]  me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to answer your questions about
[08:04.080 --> 08:09.400]  my breeding project. All right. Let's get into some listener emails. This will segue
[08:09.400 --> 08:14.960]  me into the reverting and revegging topic that I teased about at the top of the show.
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.060]  We've got a bunch of great messages. This one came on Instagram. This guy had no idea
[08:20.060 --> 08:24.360]  that I was going to use this as podcast content. This was a personal conversation between him
[08:24.360 --> 08:28.880]  and I. I don't know if he wants me to say his name on the show. We're just going to
[08:28.880 --> 08:34.200]  call this the seeded herb question. Email number one. This guy says, quick question.
[08:34.200 --> 08:38.200]  I pulled off almost all the fan leaves on an early flowering strawberry cough plant
[08:38.200 --> 08:44.200]  from Sagamartha seeds. This was at five to six weeks ago. I guess the strawberry cough
[08:44.200 --> 08:48.960]  plant threw bananas before I saw them because I have seeds in all the plants fully mature
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.280]  now and the only plant that had bananas was the strawberry cough. When he says he saw
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.800]  he means that he saw male flowers developing on his female plants, which means that this
[09:01.800 --> 09:09.560]  female was actually a hermaphrodite or it was stressed and it caused it to panic and
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.740]  cause male flowers so that it could try to keep itself alive by making more seeds and
[09:14.740 --> 09:20.000]  then continuing its generations. He continues with another message. He says, will these
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.920]  banana pollen seeds make mostly plants that have a tendency to toss bananas easily or
[09:25.920 --> 09:32.120]  at the end? That's a really good question. See, the thing is, the main thing here, we
[09:32.120 --> 09:38.960]  don't know why that strawberry cough plant threw those bananas. We don't know why it
[09:38.960 --> 09:42.520]  hermaphrodited out on you. We don't know if it's a herm. We don't know if it's got herm
[09:42.520 --> 09:45.720]  traits in it. We don't know if it's one of its parents was a herm. We don't know if that
[09:45.720 --> 09:50.920]  specific phenotype is a herm. We don't know why that plant threw bananas. It could have
[09:50.920 --> 09:54.520]  been stressed. Things that would have caused it to throw bananas would have been a light
[09:54.520 --> 09:59.920]  leak. If that plant, some things I've seen, light comes in through your ducting. You guys,
[09:59.920 --> 10:03.480]  you're ducting those hooded lights. You've got ducting running. You're running it out
[10:03.480 --> 10:08.240]  the window or wherever. Light comes reflecting into that and the plant that is right underneath
[10:08.240 --> 10:13.760]  that reflector, I've seen those hermaphrodite because they are getting hit with light leaks.
[10:13.760 --> 10:17.360]  Another thing that could cause that plant to hermaphrodite could be heat stress. Another
[10:17.360 --> 10:21.920]  thing could be over-nutrienting it. Too much nitrogen toward the end of flower could absolutely
[10:21.920 --> 10:27.840]  cause a plant to become a hermaphrodite. Too dry, too moist, any kind of weird interruption
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.560]  on some strains can cause them to herm. Now, the main question is, did that plant herm
[10:32.560 --> 10:36.320]  because it's a hermaphrodite itself or was it an environmental factor? Either way, it's
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.480]  herming. It's going to hermaphrodite on you. That's not something I would keep in my garden.
[10:40.480 --> 10:44.320]  I would go ahead and get rid of that one. Let's talk about the seeds that come out of there.
[10:44.320 --> 10:49.040]  I also have something else to mention. You said that every plant that is now mature has seeds in
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.720]  it. That makes me think that you could have a light leak in there and all of those plants
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.080]  all produce seeds because of light stress and only that strawberry koth showed the hermaphrodite
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.240]  flowers just because that's a phenotypical thing. The other ones may not have shown you
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.480]  the hermaphrodite flowers, but they could have seeded on their own just from being stressed,
[11:06.480 --> 11:10.560]  even if you didn't see flowers in there. Maybe that strawberry koth is the only one that you
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.560]  actually noticed the flowers. Maybe it produced them to where you could see them. That's just a
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.320]  possibility. Also, you're right. That all could have been seeded by that rogue hermaphrodite
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.720]  strawberry koth. If that strawberry koth was a hermaphrodite, you may have created some seeds
[11:24.720 --> 11:29.040]  that may grow some great phenotypes, but you may also run into a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.160]  The same thing could be true if you got your seeds from stressing those plants from light stress
[11:34.160 --> 11:38.960]  or from overfeeding or from underfeeding or for overwatering, whatever caused that.
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.560]  You may have produced some amazing progeny. You also may have produced a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.440]  My main piece of advice is don't share those seeds with anybody until you've ran a bunch of them
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.240]  yourself. When you do give them out, make sure people know that they do have a tendency or at
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.240]  least a likelihood to have some hermaphrodite traits in there because we don't want people
[11:58.240 --> 12:03.120]  wasting their time growing herbs when they could be growing quality stuff. The guy that sent me
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.120]  this message, you have produced some quality stuff. So let's just stick to that. You guys,
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.200]  my throat's burning out for a second. I obviously need a quick drink. I'll be right back. All right,
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.520]  you guys, I am back while I was taking a drink and a couple of dabs, something dawned on me.
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.800]  Our listener in his message said that his plant was an early flowering strawberry koth plant. Now,
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.920]  that phrase early flowering indicates a couple of things to me. I wonder if that plant flowered
[12:25.920 --> 12:30.560]  more quickly than the other plants. Like, did it show flowers at like day 10 when the other plants
[12:30.560 --> 12:37.040]  waited till day 14 or 15 or did it flower on its own while it was in under veg lights under 18 or
[12:37.040 --> 12:41.680]  24 hours of light? I'm not sure what you mean by early flowering, but that says something to me.
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.160]  A plant that wants to auto flower like that is probably a hermaphrodite. The reason it's trying
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.680]  to flower early is because a male plant wants to get up above the female plants. It grows a little
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.400]  taller. It wants to get up above the female plants and it wants to start dropping pollen so that it's
[12:56.400 --> 13:01.120]  already spitting out pollen by the time those females are ready. The cannabis plant's whole
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.960]  goal in life is to reproduce. So that plant is probably a hermaphrodite. It wants to get taller
[13:06.960 --> 13:12.160]  than everybody. It wants to flower first. It wants to have pollen falling before all of those females
[13:12.160 --> 13:15.600]  are ready so that it's ready for the party. It's over there at the party set up. It's already got
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.400]  a beer in hand. It's just waiting for the chicks to show up. So I would not use that plant for
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.280]  growing or breeding anymore. The seeds that you made are probably produced from a hermaphrodite
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.720]  plant. You're going to see some hermaphroditic tendencies in that progeny. I wouldn't give those
[13:30.720 --> 13:36.400]  out to anybody. I would grow those myself and pay very close attention to what happens to those
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.720]  plants. All right. Dude, thanks for the message. If you ever have any more questions, send them to me.
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.040]  I will use more of your stuff on the podcast because you have some great questions because
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.360]  you're an advanced grower and I like where you're going. Keep up the good work. Shout out. You're
[13:49.360 --> 13:52.960]  doing a good job. I won't say your name on the show, but you know who I'm talking to. All right.
[13:52.960 --> 13:56.960]  That brings us to our next email. This is a little bit of an update. A few episodes ago,
[13:56.960 --> 14:01.120]  I was sent an email about monster cropping and I told the dude that I wasn't sure what he meant
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.360]  about monster cropping because when I Googled it, there were a ton of different options. So I asked
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.920]  him for more information. He has replied. This is what he said. He said, Hey, bro, when I was asking
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.480]  about monster cropping, I was meaning when you take a cut off a female plant that's about three
[14:14.480 --> 14:19.920]  weeks in bloom and re-veg her. I had a buddy telling me about this last week. He says that
[14:19.920 --> 14:26.080]  the clone goes crazy making shoots and there's no need to top her. So I'm assuming you were
[14:26.080 --> 14:29.840]  re-vegging the clone that you're taking and you were letting that plant flower and finish out.
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.720]  That sounds like a decent idea. If you're taking that clone from near the bottom of the plant,
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.560]  if you're not taking it off of the top because you don't want to disrupt the flowering tops,
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.400]  it kind of seems like it's a good idea. It kind of also seems like it could be a waste of time
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.000]  and the amount of time you've got to plant it's three weeks into flower. It's already starting
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.360]  to show little buds. It's already in flower. The hormones have converted. It wants to make buds.
[14:53.360 --> 14:58.080]  Now you need to take that clone and get it in the cloner or how in the dome, however you do it. It
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.480]  needs to be under 24 hours of light and you have to revert that plant all the way back to a
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.080]  vegetative state. Then you have to veg it to the size that you need it and then you can flower it.
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.360]  It seems like it takes a long time and honestly, I wouldn't even flower out that plant. I would
[15:13.360 --> 15:18.240]  take clones once it started getting healthy and re-vegging and spitting out proper shoots. I would
[15:18.240 --> 15:25.040]  take clones of that and turn those clones into a mother plant and then start over. It kind of seems
[15:25.040 --> 15:29.520]  like a lot of work for just a plant with some extra shoots to tell you the truth. You could
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.080]  probably in the amount of time that you're re-vegging to develop those shoots to re-veg it
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.040]  to get it healthy. I could probably just cut another clone and make a happy plant by topping
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.120]  and shaping and pruning and making the plant the size and shape I wanted it to be. It seems like
[15:43.440 --> 15:48.480]  a waste of time in my opinion. I'm not going to knock anybody's method because they may have a
[15:48.480 --> 15:52.800]  purpose for this. It may be working for them. That's great, but I bet you in the amount of
[15:52.800 --> 15:59.120]  time you're spending re-vegging, I could probably just cut clones and do things the simple way. Top
[15:59.120 --> 16:03.520]  it, train it, get it going. It's a great message. I'm glad you told me what monster cropping is.
[16:03.520 --> 16:07.120]  I've never tried that. If anybody else out there has tried monster cropping, send me a message.
[16:07.120 --> 16:10.960]  Send me some pictures. Let me know more info about it. Let me know how it goes for you.
[16:11.040 --> 16:14.960]  It's easy. GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com. I would love to hear from you.
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.000]  So we've been talking about re-vegging. I did kind of bash it and say that it's sort of a
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.720]  waste of time, but there are times when re-vegging is a very useful application.
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.040]  There are reasons to do it. Maybe you forgot to take a clone. I always talk about when you grow
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.960]  from seed, make sure you take clones because you may grow the best shoot you've ever grown.
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.600]  And if you don't have a clone, you're going to be angry. So if you didn't take a clone of that plant,
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.160]  re-vegging is always an option. Or maybe you're like me. Maybe you did take a shit ton of clones
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.320]  and maybe you fucked up and maybe all your clones died. So now you don't have any clones of that
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.120]  strain. That has happened to me before. That shit does happen. Or maybe you're even more like me
[16:49.120 --> 16:52.800]  and my friend Colin. Maybe you grow too many seeds and you don't even have any room left to
[16:52.800 --> 16:57.760]  take more clones. So your only option is to revert those plants. So there are reasons why.
[16:58.320 --> 17:01.920]  So let's talk a little bit about re-vegging. Re-vegging is actually when you have flowered
[17:01.920 --> 17:06.960]  out a cannabis plant and you want to return it back to its vegetative state so you can start
[17:06.960 --> 17:12.000]  fresh. Now like I said before, I would return that plant back to a veg state and I would take
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.400]  clones from it and then use those clones as my new mother plants. I wouldn't try to flower that one
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.800]  back out. It feels to me like you would just kind of wear that plant out. You can do it, but it's
[17:20.800 --> 17:25.280]  going to stress that plant out. It's probably going to get weaker as it goes. I can't guarantee that,
[17:25.280 --> 17:29.040]  but I wouldn't do it. I would take, I would re-veg it and then try to take a clone. This is like your
[17:29.040 --> 17:32.880]  second chance. So hopefully your clones live this time. Hopefully you don't kill them all. Hopefully
[17:32.880 --> 17:37.360]  you remember to take them. So you're going to re-veg your plant. Something really helpful that
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.480]  will really speed up your re-vegging process. And this sounds crazy, but this will work.
[17:43.360 --> 17:50.000]  When you begin to flush approximately 10 to 14 days before harvest time, I fully recommend that
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.240]  you turn your lights back on to 18-6. That's right. No more 12-12. We want them on for 18 hours
[17:58.240 --> 18:05.520]  and off for six hours a day for the last 10 to 14 days of your flowering cycle. So while you're
[18:05.520 --> 18:11.440]  flushing, change the timer back to 18-6. This isn't enough, that two week period isn't enough
[18:11.440 --> 18:17.040]  time to revert those plants back to veg since they are so far along in flower. And you may see some
[18:17.040 --> 18:22.080]  of the buds start to try to revert. Just harvest. You're cool. It's time. Just do that. It's harvest
[18:22.080 --> 18:28.000]  time anyway. You're cutting those plants down. It's cool. So about 10 to 14 days before harvest time,
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.960]  put your timer back on to 18-6. That is your veg schedule. Put it back on there. That'll get the
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.960]  plant sped up back into the re-veg phase. Let them finish. Cut your plants down. When you're harvesting,
[18:38.960 --> 18:45.360]  leave the bottom three buds on the bottom branches of your plant. So if you've got a single stock
[18:45.360 --> 18:49.360]  plant, if you did not top, if you've got a plant with one stock coming up, there's a little
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.040]  intersection where it makes a peace sign, right? You got the main stock going up. You got a branch
[18:53.040 --> 18:57.200]  coming off the left. You got a branch coming off the right. Up the left branch and up the right
[18:57.200 --> 19:03.280]  branch, there will be little buds. Leave those buds. You want to leave the bottom three buds
[19:03.280 --> 19:08.240]  on those bottom branches. So from the bottom of the plant up, find the bottom ones and then go
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.600]  one, two, three. Leave those three buds and harvest everything else on the bottom two branches. If you
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.920]  topped it, you've got four branches. So on those bottom four, leave the bottom three buds. That's
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.520]  what you're going to revert into a vegetative plant and start over. So once you've harvested the plant,
[19:23.520 --> 19:28.720]  move it to a room with 24 hours of light. You can either use a T5, you can use a metal halide,
[19:28.720 --> 19:34.080]  or you can use an LED. The more light you use, the more quickly your plant will return back to
[19:34.080 --> 19:39.200]  a vegetative stage and you can start taking clones from it and then use one of those clones as a new
[19:39.200 --> 19:44.080]  mother plant. Veg that one out and then take clones from that. And those clones can be your
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.400]  next crop. I feel like you have now solved the problem of a flowering plant. You've fixed the
[19:48.400 --> 19:51.840]  hormones. You've gotten it back to the way it should be as a vegetative plant and you're right
[19:51.840 --> 19:56.800]  back where you began. One thing I should mention is while you're waiting for your plant to revert,
[19:56.800 --> 20:02.400]  you should feed it with kelp and vegetative nutrients. Just use your basic veg nudes.
[20:02.400 --> 20:07.280]  More nitrogen will help speed up the process, but don't overdo it. Now, if you want to speed up this
[20:07.280 --> 20:14.560]  process, there is one thing that you can do. You can add 200 particles per million of GA3, that's
[20:14.560 --> 20:20.800]  gibberellic acid, to your feed and it will really speed up the reverting process. What this will do
[20:21.360 --> 20:28.000]  now, earlier I talked about taking that flowering plant and reverting it back to veg and then taking
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.640]  a clone from that and using that clone as your new mother and then cutting clones from that one.
[20:32.640 --> 20:36.960]  If you use the gibberellic acid, I feel like you can take that plant that was flowering and you
[20:36.960 --> 20:42.560]  can revert it and then take clones from it and those clones will be completely fine to work with.
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.800]  Keep one of those as your mother plant, flower out the rest of them, and you were back on track
[20:46.800 --> 20:51.440]  with vegetative plants and a mother. You did not lose your strain. Now you can grow that
[20:51.440 --> 20:55.040]  strain forever. You can keep it around. Make sure you take clones from here on out.
[20:56.080 --> 20:59.040]  That's how you do reveging. Guys, I hope you learned a lot from that. I want to give a huge
[20:59.040 --> 21:02.480]  shout out to my friend Colin from the Ethos Collective. Make sure you support the Ethos
