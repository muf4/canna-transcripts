[00:00.000 --> 00:04.320]  Welcome to the show, everybody. It's time for episode 383 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.320 --> 00:08.860]  podcast. This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.860 --> 00:13.000]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.380]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store. I like to start the podcast off by letting you
[00:20.380 --> 00:24.920]  know what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of goat power from Apothecary Farms.
[00:24.920 --> 00:29.980]  I picked this up at their Pueblo medical location. Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary.
[00:29.980 --> 00:38.520]  The potency label on this concentrate says it is 74.8% THC and 86.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:38.520 --> 00:42.860]  This stuff smells delicious. If you have ever smelled or smoked a golden goat, this is exactly
[00:42.860 --> 00:46.820]  what golden goat smells like to me. I'm giving it a fresh smell so I can give you a fair
[00:46.820 --> 00:52.700]  description. It's got a hint of citrus, not overpowering citrus, but it does have a citrus
[00:52.700 --> 00:59.060]  base to it with a tropical pineapple and a juicy fruit gum sort of aroma on top of it,
[00:59.060 --> 01:03.500]  minus that stickiness that a juicy fruit piece of gum would have. I know it's weird
[01:03.500 --> 01:07.220]  to say something smells sticky. I think that stickiness is part of the flavor and aroma
[01:07.220 --> 01:12.320]  of the gum. It doesn't have that. It's got that tropical sweetness. It's got some citrus.
[01:12.320 --> 01:17.460]  It's got a hint of pineapple, mostly a citrus and tropical fruit sort of a thing going on.
[01:17.460 --> 01:23.500]  I would really describe it as a orange pineapple tropical fruit Jolly Rancher would probably
[01:23.500 --> 01:28.800]  be the most accurate description that I could nail it down to. So that's the aroma and flavor.
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.960]  It has got a beautiful golden color to it. It's got just the right amount of diamonds,
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.920]  just the right amount of sauce in there. Beautiful, beautiful goat power from our friends at Apothecary
[01:37.920 --> 01:42.880]  Farms. And obviously it has got me amped up and ready to talk my face off. So this should
[01:42.880 --> 01:47.860]  be a great podcast. If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series
[01:47.860 --> 01:53.440]  of in-depth grow lessons. In episode 351, we talk about setting a goal for the garden.
[01:53.440 --> 01:57.080]  Then we talk about picking a space for the garden. Then we talk about the appropriate
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.200]  equipment and setting up the grow safely and effectively. Then we work our way through
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.360]  getting clones and starting a grow. At this point, we're all the way to week four of the
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.160]  grow. In this episode, we're going to talk about weeks four, five, and six. If you're
[02:11.160 --> 02:16.520]  a new grower or if you're new to the podcast, I suggest you head back to episode 351 and
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.460]  start with the grow lessons there. If you are an experienced grower or if you feel like
[02:20.460 --> 02:26.080]  you were up to speed or if you've been following along, let's jump right into a grow lesson.
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.920]  In this lesson, we're going to focus on episodes four, five, and six of the flowering phase.
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.720]  At this point of flowering, it should be obvious where the bud sites are going to be. You should
[02:35.720 --> 02:39.200]  have little buds popping up. They should look like little dandelions. They're starting to
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.780]  actually form into buds by now. It should be clearly obvious where the buds are. It
[02:43.780 --> 02:48.960]  should also be more than obvious which plants are males and females. All of the males better
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.200]  be gone by now or you have pollinated everything and you're going to have a seeded crop. So
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.480]  all of the males are gone at this point. At this point, your buds are starting to form.
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.360]  You're seeing little pistol hairy covered buds. You're starting to get minimal bud mass
[03:04.360 --> 03:09.440]  at this point. We are also coming out of that rapid stretch phase. For the first three weeks
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.360]  of flowering, our plants really like to stretch and take off. That is pretty much over. Our
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.920]  plants are still going to get taller. Hopefully that top bud grows gigantic, but that rapid
[03:18.920 --> 03:23.120]  stretch phase is over. We don't have to worry so much about the plants just taking off on
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.560]  us anymore. They're going to stop stretching and they're going to start focusing their
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.000]  energy more on developing the fat chunky buds we want. Now at this point, if you don't have
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  a carbon filter, it is really time to get a carbon filter in your grow room. If you've
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.080]  got any air exiting the grow, going outside that the neighbors may smell, you need a carbon
[03:42.080 --> 03:47.520]  filter by now. Things are going to start getting really aromatic from here on out. It is only
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.680]  going to get worse. So keep your odor under control. I've said it before, a very common
[03:52.680 --> 03:57.640]  way for your garden to be discovered is for the aroma to be noticed by a neighbor. The
[03:57.640 --> 04:01.060]  neighbors call the police, the police driver on the block, they narrow it down, they knock
[04:01.060 --> 04:05.000]  on your door. By the time they hit the front porch, they can smell it. They know it's you.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.240]  They come knock on the door. If you are in a legal state, they want to count your plants.
[04:09.240 --> 04:12.920]  It's still a pain in the ass. You've got law enforcement in the house, in the grow. It's
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.600]  stressful. If you are in a non-legal area, if whoever shows up at your front door feels
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.440]  that they have got probable cause to come into your house, they can come, they can discover
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.560]  your grow. You may be handy with the laws. You may speak well. You may know how to keep
[04:25.560 --> 04:29.900]  them out of the house for now. But if the aroma was strong enough, if their suspicion
[04:29.900 --> 04:33.480]  was strong enough, they're going to contact the judge. They will have a warrant. And in
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.940]  several days, they will be back. They'll pull off the front door. They will come in armed.
[04:37.940 --> 04:42.360]  It will be scary as shit. It will destroy your entire garden and ask questions later.
[04:42.360 --> 04:47.920]  So now is the time to have a carbon filter. Always be thinking about safety and security
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.620]  if you are growing in a legal or non-legal state. You probably don't even notice how
[04:52.620 --> 04:57.000]  pungent your garden is because you're there every day. But the first time the mailman
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.400]  walks in front of the house and catches a little whiff, he's going to know exactly what
[05:01.400 --> 05:06.440]  that is. The first time a little bit of aroma wafts out of your grow and hits your neighbor
[05:06.440 --> 05:13.200]  right in her nose, she's going to know exactly what that aroma is immediately. In this scenario,
[05:13.200 --> 05:18.120]  We are only 4 weeks into flower and our plants are beginning to stink. It is only going to
[05:18.120 --> 05:24.180]  get worse. By week 7, 8, and 9, it is going to be pungent. As soon as we start harvesting
[05:24.180 --> 05:30.060]  these plants and trimming the plants, that aroma is going to increase exponentially.
[05:30.060 --> 05:34.360]  Don't add that extra stress to yourself by stinking up the entire neighborhood with your
[05:34.360 --> 05:39.060]  grow. I understand that buying a carbon filter and an extraction fan sound like just another
[05:39.060 --> 05:43.380]  expense to a new grower, but I would much rather invest that money in a filter and
[05:43.380 --> 05:45.780]  a blower than my lawyer and bail.
[05:45.780 --> 05:49.780]  Alright, I feel like I've made my point. It is time for a carbon filter. If you don't
[05:49.780 --> 05:54.500]  have one now, it is time to start taking the steps to get a carbon filter in your garden.
[05:54.500 --> 05:59.020]  Alright, I feel like that's a good overview of what's going on in the garden. Buds are
[05:59.020 --> 06:03.660]  showing, the stretch phase is over, and it is starting to stink. Now let's talk about
[06:03.660 --> 06:08.860]  the environment in our grow for weeks 4, 5, and 6.
[06:08.860 --> 06:13.820]  Let's start with temperature. For a daytime temperature for weeks 4, 5, and 6, I would
[06:13.820 --> 06:19.460]  suggest a range of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If you can dial it in a little tighter, I
[06:19.460 --> 06:25.580]  would like to be between 74 and 77 degrees. During the night, I would suggest a temperature
[06:25.580 --> 06:31.100]  in the range of 60 to 70 degrees. If you can dial it in nice and tight, I would recommend
[06:31.100 --> 06:38.180]  65 to 68 degrees. Again, I'm going to suggest no more than a 10 degree difference in your
[06:38.180 --> 06:43.740]  day and night temperature. What that means is, if your day temperature is 77 degrees,
[06:43.740 --> 06:48.380]  you don't want your night temperature any lower than 67 degrees. We don't want to see
[06:48.380 --> 06:54.660]  any more than a 10 degree diurnal temperature variation. If we allow drastic temperature
[06:54.660 --> 06:59.460]  drops in the night cycle, we will slow down the plant growth, and we will also encourage
[06:59.460 --> 07:05.260]  powdery mildew development. So again, during the day, we want to be between 70 and 80 degrees.
[07:05.300 --> 07:10.820]  At night, we want to be between 60 and 70 degrees. Now, as time goes on, we are going
[07:10.820 --> 07:15.700]  to want to reduce the temperature of the grow room. Later in flower, we want to make the
[07:15.700 --> 07:21.000]  room a little bit cooler. So if you are struggling to get the room to 74 at this point, maybe
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.100]  just keep it up there at 78, 79 degrees, so that when weeks 8 and 9 come around, we can
[07:26.100 --> 07:29.860]  reduce that temperature down to as low as you can get it. If the lowest you can get
[07:29.860 --> 07:36.140]  it is 74, let's wait until weeks 8 and 9 to get it there and leave it around 77 now.
[07:36.140 --> 07:39.500]  Now I know a lot of people are going to say, why do we want to make it cooler? There are
[07:39.500 --> 07:44.780]  several reasons. Think about a plant outside. As the seasons change, it gets colder. It
[07:44.780 --> 07:49.500]  knows, oh shit, the end of the season is coming. I need to ripen up. I need to finish. So that
[07:49.500 --> 07:54.100]  will encourage the plant to finish. It will also encourage beautiful colors. It will also
[07:54.100 --> 07:59.980]  encourage more terpene production. Heat and light break down terpenes. So why not make
[07:59.980 --> 08:04.620]  it a little bit cooler where we can preserve a little bit more terps. I also feel that
[08:04.620 --> 08:09.100]  that little bit of cold toward the end will increase in density. You will get tighter,
[08:09.100 --> 08:14.860]  more dense buds. It also will help reduce humidity. And late in flower, we need a little
[08:14.860 --> 08:18.940]  bit less humidity because we've got those big chunky buds and we don't want to develop
[08:18.940 --> 08:23.940]  bud rot in the middle of our flowers. So reducing the temperature later in flower
[08:23.940 --> 08:28.660]  has many advantages. I understand that not all rooms are set up to be able to reduce
[08:28.660 --> 08:32.780]  the temperature late in flower. You may be running a perpetual cycle. You just simply
[08:32.780 --> 08:37.260]  may not have the equipment to get it that cool in flower. It is not a requirement. It
[08:37.260 --> 08:42.220]  is just a little bonus. It's a little tip and trick that may help increase aroma and
[08:42.220 --> 08:47.980]  color and density and also help you avoid powdery mildew and boitritis toward the end
[08:48.020 --> 08:53.660]  of your flowering phase. So that is why I suggest reducing the temperature late in flower.
[08:53.660 --> 08:59.460]  We will talk more about that as we move through these grow lessons. Now let's talk about humidity.
[08:59.460 --> 09:06.140]  For weeks four, five, and six, I suggest 40% relative humidity. We have reduced the humidity
[09:06.140 --> 09:10.900]  by 10% from last week. We don't need as much moisture in the air. We're starting to develop
[09:10.900 --> 09:15.700]  buds. Those buds act like sponges. They will gather all of that moisture in the air, which
[09:15.700 --> 09:20.260]  will lead to boitritis, which is our worst nightmare when we get giant buds in a commercial
[09:20.260 --> 09:26.060]  facility. So let's reduce the humidity. Let's get it down to about 40%. Now let's talk a
[09:26.060 --> 09:31.980]  little bit about nutrients for weeks four, five, and six. I know I don't give detailed
[09:31.980 --> 09:36.540]  information when I talk about nutrients in these grow lessons. That's because I don't
[09:36.540 --> 09:40.700]  know what brand of nutrients you are using. I don't know if you're using bottles. I don't
[09:40.700 --> 09:44.580]  know if you're using powder nutrients. I don't know if you're running organics. I have no
[09:44.580 --> 09:49.660]  idea what you have chosen to do. I can't be too specific with the nutrient suggestions.
[09:49.660 --> 09:55.020]  What I can do is make sure we cover the bases and I give you a solid foundation. So here
[09:55.020 --> 10:00.100]  are the things I would make sure to have in my nutrient mix for weeks four, five, and
[10:00.100 --> 10:06.340]  six. If you are running bottles, you need a basic bloom nutrient. You may have a bottle
[10:06.340 --> 10:10.460]  that says bloom. You may have a bottle that says bloom A and a bottle that says bloom
[10:10.460 --> 10:15.000]  B. Those bottles are what we need for this stage of flowering. You'll notice that those
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.580]  bottles have three numbers printed on them. That is an NPK value. At this stage of flowering,
[10:20.580 --> 10:24.940]  we do not need a lot of nitrogen. We just need a lot of nitrogen to provide energy to
[10:24.940 --> 10:29.820]  the plants. At this stage of flowering, we need more phosphorus and potassium than we
[10:29.820 --> 10:34.660]  have previously needed in the grow. So you will see a low N number and higher P and K
[10:34.660 --> 10:40.340]  value numbers on your bloom nutrient bottles. So if you're growing with bottles, hopefully
[10:40.340 --> 10:45.380]  your bloom base has covered your nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. You will also
[10:45.380 --> 10:51.500]  need CalMag at this phase of the game. I also recommend enzymes and microbes. I would also
[10:51.500 --> 10:57.160]  introduce a kelp product to my feeding regimen. I think kelp has a lot of great benefits that
[10:57.160 --> 11:02.180]  we will talk about in a future episode. This is also a great time to start introducing
[11:02.180 --> 11:06.580]  a bloom booster. Again, I don't know what products you're using. I don't know what brand
[11:06.580 --> 11:12.340]  you have chosen. Most bottle nutrients offer a very obvious bloom booster. Now is the time
[11:12.340 --> 11:17.060]  to start implementing that into your feeding schedule. If you really want to provide energy
[11:17.060 --> 11:21.740]  to your plants, you can feed them a carbohydrate product at this stage of flowering. The carbohydrates
[11:21.740 --> 11:27.000]  will give the plants energy and the carbohydrates will also feed your microbes. If you are growing
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.180]  with veg bloom powdered nutrients, I would have added Shine by now. I definitely would
[11:31.180 --> 11:36.520]  put Shine in there by week three. Now is basically the time I start tapering off the microbe
[11:36.520 --> 11:41.520]  products and start adding in the bloom booster products. The roots should be big and fat
[11:41.520 --> 11:45.980]  and healthy. By the time the plant is done, I want that plant to be nearly root bound,
[11:45.980 --> 11:50.160]  so we are well on our way to filling that pot with roots. Now I want to start focusing
[11:50.160 --> 11:54.840]  on moving that energy up top and making big giant buds. So through weeks four, five, and
[11:54.840 --> 12:00.720]  six, I start tapering off the microbes and I start increasing the bloom booster product.
[12:00.720 --> 12:06.400]  Now be careful with your bloom boosters. A lot of people want to overfeed the bloom booster.
[12:06.400 --> 12:12.420]  Most bottle nutrient companies have a very clear suggested dose printed on the bottle.
[12:12.420 --> 12:17.040]  Most of the time, that is too much. They want you to feed your plants too much so that you
[12:17.040 --> 12:22.440]  have to buy more of their product more frequently. I would suggest that a new grower starts off
[12:22.440 --> 12:28.280]  with 50% of the recommended bloom booster dosage. The first time you add that bloom
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.280]  booster to your plant feed, only put 50% of the recommended dosage and see how the plants
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.340]  respond. If the plants don't show any sign of burn or stunted growth, maybe increase
[12:38.340 --> 12:43.040]  the feeding just a little bit next time and increase it until you see the leaf tips just
[12:43.040 --> 12:46.800]  barely burn. I like to call it getting their nails done because it starts to look like
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.200]  the end of the fingers are just getting their fingernails on there. When you see them starting
[12:50.200 --> 12:53.600]  to get their nails done, that's when you know you're pushing them to their limit and they're
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.760]  just starting to get burned. You can either give them that much again and just keep burning
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.200]  them just a little bit or you can reduce it a little bit, but do not go any harder with
[13:02.200 --> 13:06.240]  the bloom booster once you see the fingernails start happening.
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.140]  Now it sounds natural and feels natural to want to add more bloom booster. That's going
[13:10.140 --> 13:15.320]  to give you bigger, fatter buds. That's what everybody wants, but there is a point of diminishing
[13:15.320 --> 13:20.080]  returns. If you add too much, it will burn the plant. Once the plants begin to burn,
[13:20.080 --> 13:23.780]  it will start to lock out nutrients. Once they lock out nutrients, they will not take
[13:23.780 --> 13:28.440]  any of your bloom booster, then it all becomes a waste of money and you have a shitty harvest.
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.040]  So don't be that guy. Don't over bloom boost your plants five or six weeks into flower
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.000]  and completely burn them and make them look like shit and ruin your crop when you've only
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  got three weeks to go.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.120]  Now those are just the basic nutrients I would recommend if you are growing from bottled
[13:44.120 --> 13:48.540]  nutrients. Every company is going to have other products to offer. Some companies may
[13:48.540 --> 13:53.360]  offer a silicate product. Some companies may offer a terpene enhancer. Some companies may
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.720]  recommend a bud hardener. I'm not sure what company you have chosen, but be careful when
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.600]  adding your additives and just pay attention when mixing. Make sure that your pH is correct
[14:02.600 --> 14:07.120]  and try to make note of your EC or your PPMs if possible.
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.140]  Now if you're growing with organics, if you're growing with super soil, you've probably mixed
[14:11.140 --> 14:14.880]  up your soil at the beginning and there's not a lot you can do to it at this point other
[14:14.880 --> 14:20.520]  than adding teas or maybe adding a cover crop or possibly a top dress. To be quite honest
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.960]  with you, that is not my area of expertise. If you're growing organically and you want
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.800]  to boost up your plants a little bit, I would probably suggest a compost tea that included
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.760]  worm castings and it would probably include some sort of guano. But again, I am not the
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.860]  organic expert. I am not the no till guy. I am not a super soil guy. I honestly grow
[14:39.860 --> 14:44.560]  in a commercial environment and I grow from bottled and powdered nutrients. Most of the
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.160]  advice and guidance that I give you on this show will be based on bottled or powdered
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.160]  nutrients.
[14:50.720 --> 14:56.040]  So I feel like that covers the basics of nutrients for weeks four, five, and six. Basically,
[14:56.040 --> 15:01.440]  we want to give them a solid NPK, a little bit of CalMag, some enzymes, some microbes,
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.000]  some carbs. I would introduce kelp. I would introduce a bloom booster. And basically at
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.840]  this point, I would start reducing the microbe products and I would start replacing the microbes
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.960]  with a bloom booster product over the next couple of weeks.
[15:13.960 --> 15:18.520]  All right, now I feel like we know what type of environment to keep these plants in. I
[15:18.560 --> 15:22.240]  feel like we know how to feed them. We know what's going on in the grow. Now, what can
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.000]  we do to these plants to increase production? What can we do to make sure they stay healthy
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.760]  and pest free all the way up to the end of the flowering cycle? One thing we need to
[15:31.760 --> 15:38.420]  keep in mind is that we need to be very selective on sprays this late in flower. I would prefer
[15:38.420 --> 15:44.060]  not to spray anything at all on these plants. But if we do run into issues, there are very
[15:44.060 --> 15:48.980]  limited options of products we can use to spray on these plants.
[15:48.980 --> 15:53.820]  So let's do our best at this point to keep bugs out of the grow room. We should already
[15:53.820 --> 15:59.260]  be implementing an integrated pest management system, which includes a spray rotation and
[15:59.260 --> 16:04.620]  possible release of predator bugs. I would also avoid going to other gardens. If you
[16:04.620 --> 16:09.400]  have friends that grow, I would stay away from their grow. I would also never take anybody
[16:09.400 --> 16:14.800]  else into my grow, especially other friends that grow. You're inviting their spider mites
[16:14.800 --> 16:20.140]  right into your garden. Also change clothes. If you go to another grow, if you work in
[16:20.140 --> 16:24.520]  a commercial grow and have a private grow at home, change clothes between those grows.
[16:24.520 --> 16:29.160]  I would also recommend changing clothes between stops at the grow store and going to your
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.680]  garden. Don't go straight from the hydro shop to your garden. You're picking shit up at
[16:33.680 --> 16:38.200]  the grow store all day long. All of the dirty growers are going there. All of the soil is
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.400]  being shipped there. That is a hotbed for pests. Don't take your pests from the grow
[16:43.400 --> 16:49.100]  store right to your garden. I would also recommend a dedicated pair of shoes for the garden or
[16:49.100 --> 16:53.840]  for the grow room. If you work in multiple facilities, I would have a pair of shoes for
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.020]  the grow at work. I would have a pair of shoes that I wore after work. Then I would have
[16:58.020 --> 17:02.540]  a different pair of shoes that I put on to go in my personal garden. Also, if you have
[17:02.540 --> 17:08.960]  an outdoor grow and an indoor grow, change clothes and shoes between those gardens.
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.760]  It sounds really tedious and it sounds like overkill, but we do not want to spread spider
[17:13.760 --> 17:19.080]  mites from one garden to another. The most obvious and easy way for mites to spread is
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.580]  for them to travel on a grower. So let's do our best as responsible growers, as responsible
[17:24.580 --> 17:30.040]  farmers to not spread spider mites to our other grows and to our friends' grows. It's
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.540]  pretty easy to get rid of spider mites early in flower and veg, but it is a pain in the
[17:34.540 --> 17:39.680]  ass to get rid of spider mites late in bloom. So let's not drag them into the bloom room.
[17:39.680 --> 17:43.940]  If you do have multiple rooms or multiple facilities and you do find a pest issue in
[17:43.940 --> 17:50.060]  one area, treat that area as a contaminated space. Notify everybody that works there,
[17:50.060 --> 17:55.020]  hey, there are spider mites in here. Don't go in here unless it is required. Then if
[17:55.020 --> 17:59.380]  you do have to go in that area, make sure you change clothes before entering another
[17:59.400 --> 18:04.000]  grow area and carrying those spider mites throughout the facility with you. If you have
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.520]  one room that is not infested with mites and you have another room that is infested with
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.240]  mites, work on the clean room first when you get to work, do all the work that needs to
[18:13.240 --> 18:17.520]  be done in there, close that room up and be done. Then go to that spider mite room, do
[18:17.520 --> 18:22.840]  your work in there. And then when you're done, leave the grow facility, remove your clothes,
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.040]  clean them, put them in the laundry and don't take those dirty clothes back into that clean
[18:27.140 --> 18:32.340]  room. Work on the clean room first, then work on the dirty rooms last so that we don't drag
[18:32.340 --> 18:37.700]  those spider mites into the room that is clean. And if you know that one room is contaminated
[18:37.700 --> 18:42.780]  and you have to go in there, I would almost suggest a lab coat or a Tyvek suit that you
[18:42.780 --> 18:47.540]  can swap between rooms. If you've got to go into the mited room, throw on the lab coat,
[18:47.540 --> 18:51.740]  throw on the Tyvek suit, go into the spider mited room, do what you need to do, come out
[18:51.740 --> 18:56.840]  of that room, remove the lab coat or Tyvek suit, replace it with a fresh lab coat or
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.480]  Tyvek suit, and then go into the room that you need to work in next. Again, I know this
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.600]  sounds tedious. I know this sounds like overkill, but imagine if you've got 500 plants in one
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.840]  room and you're expecting to harvest over a hundred pounds and we just dragged spider
[19:10.840 --> 19:14.840]  mites into there from the other room. Now we've got one room that is almost ready to
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.400]  harvest and we've been fighting spider mites, it's almost gone. We're almost through that
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.900]  battle. But guess what? You just walked into the other room and we're five weeks into flower
[19:22.900 --> 19:26.700]  and you just dropped a spider mite bomb in there because you were lazy and didn't bother
[19:26.700 --> 19:31.820]  to change your lab coat. Small problems are small problems when they are small problems.
[19:31.820 --> 19:37.220]  But when we go to a large scale cultivation facility, a very small problem will multiply
[19:37.220 --> 19:41.900]  overnight. Those spider mites are going to have a party when we turn off the lights and
[19:41.900 --> 19:46.900]  everybody goes home. You will come in the next morning and now it is spider mite world.
[19:46.900 --> 19:51.400]  So let's do our best to not introduce spider mites to the grow because we are very limited
[19:51.400 --> 19:55.540]  on plans of attack to get rid of those mites in this point of the game. There are very
[19:55.540 --> 20:01.600]  limited sprays we can apply. One thing we can do, we can release predator bugs. Now,
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.900]  if you were planning ahead, part of your integrated pest management system did include ordering
[20:06.900 --> 20:12.420]  predator bugs to be released early in flower. Hopefully around week three, you released
[20:12.420 --> 20:17.700]  an army of predator bugs. So now if any spider mites do show up, those predators are already
[20:17.700 --> 20:22.100]  colonized. They're already there claiming their turf and no spider mites will start
[20:22.100 --> 20:26.620]  infesting your grow. Now, if you didn't get those predator bugs in there early, it is
[20:26.620 --> 20:31.400]  not too late to order predators to come attack your spider mite infestation, but you need
[20:31.400 --> 20:36.680]  to act quickly. Don't say I'll order them Monday. When you see spider mites in the grow,
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.820]  order those predator mites today. When that box of predator mites comes, you need to stop
[20:41.820 --> 20:46.680]  what you were doing and release those bugs into the garden immediately. We need to win
[20:46.680 --> 20:51.240]  the war. We need to release our troops to get in there and destroy those spider mites
[20:51.240 --> 20:55.200]  that are sucking the juices out of our plants. They are destroying our potency and they are
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.600]  diminishing our yields. We need to get rid of them immediately. So if it's too late to
[21:00.600 --> 21:05.920]  spray, I highly suggest you order predator bugs. Order more than you think you need.
[21:05.920 --> 21:11.640]  We want a large army to get in there and wipe out the infestation as quickly as possible.
[21:11.660 --> 21:15.740]  Now earlier I did say we are very limited on the products we can spray to our plants
[21:15.740 --> 21:20.580]  this late in flower. There are a few beneficial fungus based products that can be applied
[21:20.580 --> 21:25.660]  to the plants this late in flower that will not affect the taste. If you understand the
[21:25.660 --> 21:31.620]  products you are using, you can apply a sprayed pesticide and you can release predators and
[21:31.620 --> 21:37.480]  they will work together. The proper pesticide at this stage of the game will not harm your
[21:37.580 --> 21:43.460]  flowers and it will not kill your predators. Again, I do not suggest spraying plants with
[21:43.460 --> 21:49.780]  bulky flowers, but sometimes something has to be done. We do have a few spray application
[21:49.780 --> 21:56.780]  options. Do not spray anything oil based this late in flower. It will ruin the flavor and
[21:57.060 --> 22:03.500]  aroma of your plants. The only things I would recommend to spray this late in flower would
[22:03.500 --> 22:09.780]  be beneficial fungus type products. I would never apply an oil this late in flower and
[22:09.780 --> 22:14.980]  I do not even want to spray them unless it is absolutely necessary. I would rather release
[22:14.980 --> 22:19.660]  the predators and let them do their thing, but I understand sometimes you are going to
[22:19.660 --> 22:24.100]  go into panic mode. Sometimes it is more than what the predators can handle. Sometimes you
[22:24.100 --> 22:28.260]  may have already purchased a pesticide and you do not have funding to order insects.
[22:28.260 --> 22:32.900]  I do understand that things come up in a garden and life does happen and we cannot always
[22:32.900 --> 22:38.300]  control things. One thing we can do from this situation is take note. We can try to
[22:38.300 --> 22:43.060]  understand how did we get spider mites and how can we prevent this from happening next
[22:43.060 --> 22:49.380]  time. So it is time to stop spraying the plants. It is also time to stop running the sulfur
[22:49.380 --> 22:53.780]  burner. If you have got a sulfur burner in your grow, turn that shit off. It is making
[22:53.780 --> 22:59.060]  your plants taste terrible. It is making your concentrates taste terrible. Let us stop using
[22:59.060 --> 23:03.700]  sulfur burners in the grow and let us start correcting the true issue. What is causing
[23:03.700 --> 23:08.860]  the powdery mildew? People use sulfur to prevent and cure powdery mildew. How about we find
[23:08.860 --> 23:13.660]  the cause? Instead of burning sulfur in the room and making the room smell like shit,
[23:13.660 --> 23:17.940]  making your buds smell like shit, making your concentrates smell like shit, making the final
[23:17.940 --> 23:22.380]  product completely taste like shit, let us find out what is causing that powdery mildew
[23:22.380 --> 23:27.260]  and cure that instead of just burning sulfur in the room. Now I know a lot of people have
[23:27.260 --> 23:30.900]  a sulfur burner and that is their method. That is how they learn. That is what they
[23:30.900 --> 23:35.820]  are going to do. They are not going to stop doing it because I said so. Let us compromise.
[23:35.820 --> 23:40.460]  If you insist on using a sulfur burner in your garden, perhaps you can stop using it
[23:40.460 --> 23:45.860]  around week 3 or around week 4 when those buds start popping up. Earlier in the episode,
[23:45.860 --> 23:51.020]  I suggested reducing humidity. Perhaps reducing that humidity a little bit will help prevent
[23:51.020 --> 23:55.780]  that powdery mildew. Since we are getting the fat buds, we need to reduce humidity anyway.
[23:55.780 --> 24:00.580]  Let us get it a little cooler, reduce humidity and stop burning that sulfur and I am sure
[24:00.580 --> 24:04.180]  the product will taste better. If you have ever smoked a concentrate that tasted like
[24:04.180 --> 24:09.500]  fish or fish oil, a lot of the times that is because there was a sulfur burner being
[24:09.500 --> 24:15.500]  used in the room during the flowering phase. So no more sprays and no more sulfur burners
[24:15.500 --> 24:22.340]  after week 3, please. So now that we are approaching week 4, it is time to reduce some of the physical
[24:22.340 --> 24:27.180]  stress we have been performing to the plant. I still want to do some popping and twisting
[24:27.180 --> 24:32.020]  and I still want to work them into the nets, but I do not want to go as hard and as extreme
[24:32.020 --> 24:37.060]  as I was before. I want to allow these plants to use their energy on producing buds now
[24:37.060 --> 24:40.940]  and not recovering from all the popping and breaking and not being stressed out. I want
[24:40.940 --> 24:45.200]  them to just focus on making fat, chunky buds and sweet trichomes for me. So I am going
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.540]  to reduce the stress a little bit. That does not mean I am going to stop beating them up,
[24:49.540 --> 24:53.840]  but I am going to mellow out just a little bit on these girls. So we are going to reduce
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.500]  the stress. We are going to do a little less popping and twisting, but we are still going
[24:57.500 --> 25:02.080]  to pop and twist the stems. We are also going to continue working these plants into the
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.580]  trellis. If you have got a trellis net and you have got a plant that is taken off getting
[25:05.580 --> 25:09.820]  too tall, do not be afraid to grab that one, crack the stem and work it right back under
[25:09.820 --> 25:15.540]  the net. The start of week 4 is also a good time to do our final bottoming. We have got
[25:15.540 --> 25:18.860]  those little bud sets showing. We know where the buds are going to be. If you have got
[25:18.860 --> 25:22.780]  a stick with a bunch of little tiny shitty buds on it, just clean those little popcorn
[25:22.780 --> 25:26.660]  balls right on off and leave that stuff at the end of the branch to develop into a nice
[25:26.660 --> 25:31.980]  chunky bud. In a previous episode, I talked about taking off all those little tiny sucker
[25:31.980 --> 25:35.900]  buds. You can leave the thick branches, but those little buds that grow off the base of
[25:35.900 --> 25:40.120]  that branch toward the bottom, those can get cut off. If they are just a waste of space
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.140]  and energy and they are not going to produce anything except a pain in the ass, you can
[25:44.140 --> 25:48.340]  cut those right off of the plant. Some growers like to say that is what I was going to make
[25:48.340 --> 25:51.620]  my concentrate out of. That is what I was going to make my edibles out of. That is
[25:51.620 --> 25:55.540]  fine if you want to leave that there. I feel like if you cut that stuff off that does not
[25:55.540 --> 26:00.020]  get a lot of light, you take that energy and you move it right up to the top of the plant.
[26:00.020 --> 26:03.820]  Instead of the plant feeding those 12 little tiny shit buds at the bottom, it can just
[26:03.820 --> 26:07.260]  put that energy right up at the top where it is getting light. It can use that energy
[26:07.260 --> 26:12.380]  to make that top cola that much beefier, that much fatter. It also sucks to trim that bottom
[26:12.380 --> 26:16.340]  stuff. Nobody wants to trim those little popcorn buds. Nobody wants to waste time cutting that
[26:16.340 --> 26:20.340]  off. If you can cut something off to make something better, why wouldn't you do it?
[26:20.340 --> 26:25.220]  Now is a good time to go do a final bottoming. Just clean up that messy crap on the bottom
[26:25.220 --> 26:31.400]  that is not going to turn into any usable bud. I also like to do a light defoliation
[26:31.400 --> 26:37.740]  at this point. Any leaf with a purple petiole will get taken off at this point in time.
[26:37.740 --> 26:41.740]  If you have a big leaf, it has a purple stem, you can see that long purple stem, just go
[26:41.740 --> 26:45.140]  ahead and break that off. Break that stem off as close to the branch, as close to the
[26:45.140 --> 26:48.940]  bud as you can so you don't leave that little stem there with moisture hanging out. Just
[26:48.940 --> 26:53.580]  break that stem right off. Get those leaves out of the room. We don't need all the excessive
[26:53.580 --> 26:54.580]  leaves.
[26:54.580 --> 26:58.500]  So anything with the purple stem, I'll go kind of light. I'll do one layer. I'll look
[26:58.500 --> 27:02.140]  at the room. I'll say, yeah, I could do more. And then I'll go back and take off more leaves.
[27:02.140 --> 27:05.480]  And then I'll stand back and look into the room. And I just try to make sure that I've
[27:05.480 --> 27:10.140]  gotten all the giant leaves that are blocking the light from hitting the buds. If I can
[27:10.140 --> 27:14.420]  see light coming down and it's hitting a leaf, and I can clearly see that that leaf is hanging
[27:14.420 --> 27:18.920]  over a bud site, I will remove that leaf so that bud site can get the light.
[27:18.920 --> 27:22.500]  Now a lot of old school growers are going to tell you don't remove the leaves because
[27:22.500 --> 27:26.500]  that's where the nutrients and sugars are stored. But I'm pretty sure earlier in this
[27:26.500 --> 27:31.140]  episode we talked about feeding these plants a whole bunch of nutrients. There's not really
[27:31.140 --> 27:34.940]  a reason for these plants to store nutrients. We are feeding the shit out of them. These
[27:34.940 --> 27:39.060]  are high performance plants that are going to get a high performance meal every day.
[27:39.060 --> 27:42.580]  They don't need that stored stuff. We can pull those leaves off.
[27:42.580 --> 27:47.460]  Those leaves will give us opportunity for powdery mildew. Those leaves are places for
[27:47.460 --> 27:52.540]  pests to hide. Those leaves have to come off when we trim anyway. Why not take those leaves
[27:52.540 --> 27:54.940]  off now and save us the trouble?
[27:54.940 --> 27:59.620]  Now don't go extreme and make the plants naked. Take off the leaves with the giant petioles
[27:59.620 --> 28:04.020]  and the leaves that are in the way. This is kind of intimidating for new growers and honestly
[28:04.020 --> 28:08.700]  this is an art and a skill that you will have to develop over time. A good way to practice
[28:08.780 --> 28:13.500]  defoliating and seeing what happens to the plants is to get four plants of the same thing.
[28:13.500 --> 28:17.700]  So you've got four clones of let's say golden goat. You've got four golden goat plants.
[28:17.700 --> 28:21.500]  They're all in the same room. They're all in the same environment. Why not defoliate
[28:21.500 --> 28:27.500]  one really hard? Defoliate one kind of hard. Defoliate one a little bit and then don't
[28:27.500 --> 28:31.940]  defoliate the other one at all. Then take pictures if you can. Then take as many notes
[28:31.940 --> 28:36.940]  as you can and then keep an eye on those notes and pictures and see which plant came out
[28:36.940 --> 28:41.100]  the best. Did the plant that you left alone come out the best? Did the plant that we beat
[28:41.100 --> 28:44.380]  to shit and almost made it naked come out the best? Or was it the one that's right in
[28:44.380 --> 28:45.380]  the middle?
[28:45.380 --> 28:51.300]  It's going to be strain specific on how hard you want to go with defoliation. But most
[28:51.300 --> 28:57.060]  strains will benefit from a medium defoliation and they will definitely benefit from removing
[28:57.060 --> 29:01.020]  all those super large leaves that are blocking your bud sites.
[29:01.020 --> 29:05.580]  Now if you go too hard, your plants will look naked and the growth will stop. You'll just
[29:05.580 --> 29:11.580]  slow them down. So don't go extremely hard on your first defoliation. Kind of practice.
[29:11.580 --> 29:15.460]  Go in there and pull off some leaves. I like to say this in the podcast all the time. You
[29:15.460 --> 29:20.460]  can take more off, but you can never glue those leaves back on. So pull a few off. Take
[29:20.460 --> 29:24.820]  a step back. Look at it. See what you think. If you want to take off more, get in there
[29:24.820 --> 29:29.220]  and take them off. If you're intimidated by it, leave the leaves there.
[29:29.220 --> 29:34.260]  One thing I will suggest is that if a leaf is yellow or funky, you remove it. Don't hesitate
[29:34.260 --> 29:39.780]  and don't be shy to take down the ugly leaves. Those need to go. Those yellow leaves are
[29:39.780 --> 29:44.220]  invitations for pests. A spider mite will see a yellow leaf and they will head right
[29:44.220 --> 29:49.340]  to that leaf because it is weak. The outer layer isn't as thick and crunchy so that spider
[29:49.340 --> 29:53.140]  mite can get its shitty little fangs right through that skin and it can get right in
[29:53.140 --> 29:56.900]  there and start sucking the juice. It doesn't have to deal with that thick, healthy plant
[29:56.900 --> 30:03.540]  flesh. So get rid of those yellow leaves and remove them from the garden as soon as possible.
[30:03.540 --> 30:07.580]  Something else I would suggest at this point in flowering is to increase airflow. It may
[30:07.580 --> 30:11.540]  be a good time to add some fans to the room. If you don't have an oscillating fan in the
[30:11.540 --> 30:16.700]  room, now is the time. We want those leaves rustling. We don't want those buds sitting
[30:16.700 --> 30:21.900]  still and letting stagnant air build up in those buds. Now we don't want the plants being
[30:21.900 --> 30:26.500]  bent over and getting shit whipped by the fan all day. We just want every leaf to rustle
[30:26.500 --> 30:30.580]  occasionally. You just want that fan to pass by and just give those leaves just a little
[30:30.580 --> 30:35.660]  rustle. Just move the air around. Just stir the air so that nothing can get still. Just
[30:35.660 --> 30:39.820]  move that air. I just keep doing this motion with my hand like you guys can see me just
[30:39.820 --> 30:44.660]  moving that air. But like I said earlier, our buds are going to start developing. They're
[30:44.660 --> 30:48.820]  going to start getting fat and chunky. Those buds work like sponges. If there's too much
[30:48.820 --> 30:52.820]  moisture in the air, that moisture will get trapped inside those buds. Then we'll start
[30:52.820 --> 30:57.940]  getting bud mold inside the bud. If you've got a fan, moving that air and moisture around,
[30:57.940 --> 31:02.980]  that will reduce the opportunities for bud mold. Now that you're adding fans, you may
[31:02.980 --> 31:08.020]  need to add some sticks or some sort of cages for supports. If you're not using a trellis
[31:08.020 --> 31:12.540]  net, your buds are going to start toppling over. Let's not wait until weeks five and
[31:12.540 --> 31:16.620]  six when those buds are big and chunky and sticky and they're falling over trying to
[31:16.620 --> 31:21.500]  break the sticks. Let's get some stakes. Let's get some tomato cages. Let's start supporting
[31:21.500 --> 31:25.340]  these plants early. If you've got a big long branch and you can tell that it's going to
[31:25.340 --> 31:29.900]  turn into a giant bud, go ahead and stick a long stake into the pot. Stick it into the
[31:29.900 --> 31:34.580]  soil. Try not to cut up too many of the roots. It's going to happen, I understand. But shove
[31:34.580 --> 31:38.340]  that stake straight into the soil. Get that stick straight up sticking where you need
[31:38.340 --> 31:44.060]  it. Then use a twisty tie or a zip tie or something gentle to just gently attach that
[31:44.060 --> 31:48.060]  topply stick to that branch. You don't want to squeeze that branch at all. It needs to
[31:48.060 --> 31:52.300]  be loose so that you don't pinch that branch. You want some freedom in there, but you don't
[31:52.300 --> 31:57.540]  want it flopping around too much. Don't pinch or crush or squeeze the branch at all. Be
[31:57.540 --> 32:02.060]  very gentle. So use a few stakes and stick them in the dirt and have them sticking straight
[32:02.060 --> 32:06.780]  up and attach those floppy branches to those stakes as needed. Don't be shy. I've seen
[32:06.780 --> 32:11.780]  people use a shit ton of stakes in each pot. If that's what you've got to do, that's what
[32:11.780 --> 32:16.580]  you've got to do to keep that plant upright. So get some sticks or get some tomato cages
[32:16.580 --> 32:21.740]  and be prepared to start supporting your plants. I hope your buds get so chunky that those
[32:21.740 --> 32:25.940]  plants just want to fall right over. That's what I hope for you. But I also hope you've
[32:25.940 --> 32:30.580]  got some sticks or a tomato cage on hand so that those plants don't die when that shit
[32:30.580 --> 32:35.100]  starts happening. So we've got some airflow. We've got some sticks in our plants. Another
[32:35.100 --> 32:40.920]  thing we need to focus on is to continue scouting for pests and PM. Just because we're this
[32:40.920 --> 32:46.140]  late in flower doesn't mean that problems can't arise. Keep your eyes open for pests
[32:46.140 --> 32:51.160]  and powdery mildew and boetritis. Now while we're scouting for pests and boetritis, we
[32:51.160 --> 32:55.840]  also need to pay attention to plant problems. Do you see any nutrient burn? Do you see any
[32:55.840 --> 33:00.760]  pH issues? Pay attention to the leaves. A few crunchy leaves here and there, that's
[33:00.760 --> 33:05.320]  acceptable. A few shitty leaves low in the canopy, that's acceptable. If you start getting
[33:05.320 --> 33:10.800]  large clusters of shitty looking leaves, you've got a problem that needs to be addressed.
[33:10.800 --> 33:14.040]  Hopefully you are taking notes of what you've been feeding the plant. Hopefully you've got
[33:14.040 --> 33:18.020]  some kind of record of what the pH was that was going into the plants. And maybe you've
[33:18.020 --> 33:21.860]  even been taking notes of what is coming out of the plant. Have you been measuring
[33:21.860 --> 33:27.840]  the EC and pH of your runoff? If so, that will help you diagnose problems if a problem
[33:27.840 --> 33:32.140]  should arise. Now while you're scouting for pests and while you're looking for nutrient
[33:32.140 --> 33:37.060]  issues, also don't forget about all of the equipment in the grow room. Just do some visual
[33:37.060 --> 33:42.700]  inspections while you're walking through the room. Listen, look, you may notice things.
[33:42.700 --> 33:47.500]  Always be paying attention to the plants and the equipment while you're in the grow. Now
[33:47.580 --> 33:51.580]  while you're looking around for equipment problems, you're looking around for pests,
[33:51.580 --> 33:57.460]  and we're also looking around for yellow leaves, we still need to keep our eyes out for hermaphrodites.
[33:57.460 --> 34:02.460]  If you are growing from seed, it is still an opportunity to reveal hermaphroditic traits
[34:02.460 --> 34:07.580]  this far into flower. So keep your eyes out for hermflowers. And I think we've talked
[34:07.580 --> 34:11.820]  a little bit in a previous episode about what to do if you do discover a hermaphroditic
[34:11.820 --> 34:16.940]  plant this late into flower. You've got several options. You can pull out the flowers, you
[34:16.940 --> 34:21.140]  can cut off the main bud that's got the male flowers on it, you can cut down the whole
[34:21.140 --> 34:25.380]  plant, or you can choose to ignore the immediate threat and you can keep an eye on that male
[34:25.380 --> 34:30.220]  flower and see if it opens and drops pollen. Just keep in mind that if you do see male
[34:30.220 --> 34:35.580]  flowers, you do run the risk of having pollen in that grow room. And at this point of flowering,
[34:35.580 --> 34:41.220]  those female plants are really eager to receive that pollen and create seeds. So keep your
[34:41.220 --> 34:46.060]  eye open because it is not too late to find hermaphrodites. In fact, that is always the
[34:46.060 --> 34:50.460]  case. Keep your eyes open through the entire grow on your first or second run with the
[34:50.460 --> 34:55.140]  new cultivar or if you're growing from seed. All right, podcast rule. This episode is starting
[34:55.140 --> 34:59.500]  to get long, so let's start recapping and start wrapping up the episode. Let's recap
[34:59.500 --> 35:03.780]  week four. In week four, we are going to continue working the plants into the nets. We're going
[35:03.780 --> 35:08.300]  to continue popping and twisting. We're going to bottom the plants a little more. And now
[35:08.300 --> 35:13.380]  is the time to put on sticks or tomato cages. We need to reduce the stress of the plants
[35:13.380 --> 35:17.660]  and start letting the buds develop. But we still need to work the plants and pop the
[35:17.660 --> 35:22.880]  stems and defoliate a little bit. Then we'll work into week five. That is when we're going
[35:22.880 --> 35:27.480]  to do our final bottoming. We need to finish bottoming the plants by the end of week five.
[35:27.480 --> 35:31.380]  We will do our final popping and twisting. Then we're going to let the plants just settle
[35:31.380 --> 35:36.660]  in and develop buds. We will do our final major defoliation. We will continue to lightly
[35:36.660 --> 35:41.820]  defoliate through harvest, but this is the last big defoliation we will do. We will also
[35:41.820 --> 35:46.120]  pull all of the shitty leaves. We'll take off all the small popcorn buds. Any branches
[35:46.120 --> 35:49.820]  that don't look like they're worth a shit will get taken out at this time. Now is the
[35:49.820 --> 35:53.660]  last chance to get supports on these buds. If you don't have some sticks or some tomato
[35:53.660 --> 35:58.220]  cages in there now, by week five, you are going to see problems. In week six, your plants
[35:58.220 --> 36:01.580]  are going to start toppling over. So now is the time to get in there and make sure you've
[36:01.580 --> 36:06.300]  got sticks and some sort of twisty tie or something like that holding your buds up.
[36:06.300 --> 36:10.860]  It is also time to increase airflow. We are going to start getting chunky buds. So if
[36:10.860 --> 36:15.740]  you don't have the airflow moving, now is the time to do it. We also need a carbon filter
[36:15.740 --> 36:19.940]  in week four. I forgot to recap that. We need that carbon filter. I feel like I covered
[36:19.940 --> 36:25.340]  that very well. Now in week six, we are going to need that airflow. You better have those
[36:25.340 --> 36:30.700]  sticks and supports done. We are done bottoming. We are done working. We are done cracking,
[36:30.700 --> 36:36.260]  popping and twisting these plants. It is time to let them grow and let the buds get fat.
[36:36.260 --> 36:40.480]  Stay on top of scouting for problems. We need to look for bugs. We need to look for powdery
[36:40.520 --> 36:46.160]  mildew. We need to look for hermaphrodites. We also need to pay attention to environmental,
[36:46.160 --> 36:51.160]  nutrient or pH stresses. And if we see anything caused by those things, we need to adjust
[36:51.160 --> 36:52.800]  accordingly.
[36:52.800 --> 36:57.320]  Now my favorite part about weeks five and six, this is when the good photos happen.
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.280]  Those buds are starting to get chunky. The buds are nice and fluffy. All of the pistils
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.320]  are still nice and white. All of the leaves are still lush and green. Now is a great time
[37:06.320 --> 37:11.440]  to start taking photos. So that is my favorite part of week six. So in week four, you got
[37:11.440 --> 37:15.280]  little nugs. You got those little popcorn balls developing. Then in week five, you're
[37:15.280 --> 37:18.680]  starting to get actual buds. You can see the buds growing up the stick. They're starting
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.560]  to get chunky. Then in week six, you actually start developing photogenic colas. It's time
[37:24.560 --> 37:27.480]  to get in there and start taking pictures. You're seeing some beef. You're starting to
[37:27.480 --> 37:32.120]  get some good colors. The trichomes are coming in. Week six is when it really starts getting
[37:32.120 --> 37:33.820]  exciting.
[37:33.820 --> 37:38.940]  Now the thing to think about is keeping these plants healthy, pest free, problem free, all
[37:38.940 --> 37:43.880]  the way till the end. Keep yourself out of trouble. Don't brag. Don't start posting photos
[37:43.880 --> 37:49.480]  just yet. If you do take a sweet ass photo in week six, I suggest you save it until harvest.
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.400]  Then start flooding the pictures out after harvest. That way, nobody knows when you're
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.020]  cutting down your crop. That's just kind of a weed grower trick from back in the day.
[37:58.020 --> 38:02.340]  Another thing to start thinking about is, is the next run ready? We're going to harvest
[38:02.340 --> 38:07.180]  these plants in two to four weeks, depending on your strain. Do you have plants lined up
[38:07.180 --> 38:12.100]  for the next run? Do you have clones that are getting rooted? Have you ordered seeds?
[38:12.100 --> 38:16.380]  Are you prepared for the next run? We don't want to miss any time, so let's get on top
[38:16.380 --> 38:21.060]  of the next run. That feels like a great opportunity to pitch my seed vendor. If you need some
[38:21.060 --> 38:27.180]  seeds, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company. You can find them at www.dankseed.store.
