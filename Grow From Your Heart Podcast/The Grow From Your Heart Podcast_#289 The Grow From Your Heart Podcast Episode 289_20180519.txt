[00:15.740 --> 00:18.420]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:18.420 --> 00:19.620]  It's time for another episode
[00:19.620 --> 00:21.520]  of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:21.520 --> 00:24.680]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.740 --> 00:27.020]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.020 --> 00:28.240]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.240 --> 00:30.860]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.860 --> 00:32.180]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.180 --> 00:33.600]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.460]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.460 --> 00:37.740]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.620 --> 00:40.580]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.680]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.680 --> 00:44.820]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.480]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.480 --> 00:48.840]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.640]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.900]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.640 --> 00:56.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you noticed,
[00:56.040 --> 00:59.640]  I did not mention an episode number at the top of the show.
[00:59.640 --> 01:03.000]  I'm not sure if I put out Thursday content or not.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.800]  That's right, I have ran out of Throwback Thursday episodes
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.500]  and I am not sure if I'm going to put together
[01:07.500 --> 01:09.120]  a quick Thursday show for you.
[01:09.120 --> 01:10.840]  So, since this came out on Monday,
[01:10.840 --> 01:13.320]  if you did get Thursday content, you're welcome.
[01:13.380 --> 01:15.460]  And if you did not, I apologize.
[01:16.580 --> 01:18.900]  By not stating a number at the top of the episode,
[01:18.900 --> 01:20.140]  I do not create any confusion
[01:20.140 --> 01:22.300]  and I also get to dodge all the internet trolls
[01:22.300 --> 01:24.500]  that wanna tell me that I did something wrong.
[01:24.500 --> 01:26.260]  So thank you guys for joining me,
[01:26.260 --> 01:27.540]  no matter what episode number this is.
[01:27.540 --> 01:29.780]  You guys, I am dabbing on some concentrates
[01:29.780 --> 01:30.620]  I wanna tell you about.
[01:30.620 --> 01:33.940]  I have got some Sour Clem from my friends at Apothecary
[01:33.940 --> 01:36.980]  and it is, I don't say this word often,
[01:36.980 --> 01:38.380]  but it's fucking amazeballs.
[01:38.380 --> 01:39.980]  This concentrate is one of my favorites
[01:39.980 --> 01:41.100]  I've grabbed in a little while.
[01:41.100 --> 01:42.980]  This batch is super nice.
[01:43.640 --> 01:44.720]  It is Sour Clem batter.
[01:44.720 --> 01:45.920]  They take their Ambrosia,
[01:45.920 --> 01:48.260]  which is their proprietary texture.
[01:48.260 --> 01:51.160]  It's got crystals and turp liquids in it.
[01:51.160 --> 01:53.320]  It's really nice, but I prefer the batter.
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.280]  They take the Ambrosia
[01:54.280 --> 01:56.400]  and then they simply whip the shit out of it
[01:56.400 --> 01:58.520]  to a battery consistency.
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.740]  It looks like a little bit of bright orange cheesecake
[02:02.740 --> 02:06.180]  or bright yellow, it's yellow, goldish orange cheesecake
[02:06.180 --> 02:07.920]  or cake batter is the texture,
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.920]  honestly, inside this little jar.
[02:09.920 --> 02:12.120]  But the smell coming out of here, the aroma,
[02:12.140 --> 02:13.140]  let me hold it up to the microphone.
[02:13.140 --> 02:15.140]  Maybe you can smell it through the mic.
[02:15.140 --> 02:16.740]  Is that coming through your speakers?
[02:16.740 --> 02:18.680]  Because it is delicious.
[02:18.680 --> 02:20.900]  It smells, so it's Sour Clem,
[02:20.900 --> 02:24.020]  which tells me it's probably sour diesel and clementine.
[02:24.020 --> 02:27.340]  The clementine comes through strong with that sweetness,
[02:27.340 --> 02:29.220]  but the sour comes through also.
[02:29.220 --> 02:31.300]  It's like sweet and sour dankness.
[02:32.340 --> 02:35.420]  It's got a hint of that dryer sheet sort of smell.
[02:35.420 --> 02:37.180]  And I'm sure you've heard me explain
[02:37.180 --> 02:39.220]  the smell of Hash's dryer sheets before,
[02:39.240 --> 02:42.280]  but that's terpenylene is the terpenoid
[02:42.280 --> 02:43.360]  that smells like that.
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.800]  It's a really, it's a good thing.
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.180]  It smells like somebody wrapped a sour diesel nugget
[02:47.180 --> 02:49.320]  in a sweet dryer sheet smell.
[02:49.320 --> 02:51.320]  It sounds like it may not be the most pleasant,
[02:51.320 --> 02:53.720]  but if you could smell it, it is so great, you guys.
[02:53.720 --> 02:54.840]  This is amazing.
[02:54.840 --> 02:56.320]  So the texture is nice also.
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.320]  It's a slightly firm cheesecake batter
[03:01.600 --> 03:02.920]  is the texture of it here.
[03:02.920 --> 03:04.120]  So what I like to do with it,
[03:04.120 --> 03:06.200]  I like to take the Sour Clem batter.
[03:06.200 --> 03:08.360]  I like to take all of the batters to tell you the truth.
[03:08.380 --> 03:10.540]  And I like to dip it in the high cannabinoid
[03:10.540 --> 03:12.340]  full spectrum extract crystals.
[03:12.340 --> 03:14.260]  So I've been taking the Sour Clem
[03:14.260 --> 03:17.180]  and I put it in the extreme oranges crystals.
[03:17.180 --> 03:19.060]  And that is a super great dab.
[03:19.060 --> 03:20.140]  That's why I'm in such a good mood.
[03:20.140 --> 03:21.140]  That's why I'm all rambly.
[03:21.140 --> 03:23.140]  I hope you guys are in a good mood also.
[03:23.140 --> 03:24.340]  I hope you're listening.
[03:24.340 --> 03:26.180]  If I'm rambly, I hope you are listening.
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.060]  Is that some shit?
[03:27.060 --> 03:28.180]  It is now.
[03:28.180 --> 03:29.620]  It's my podcast.
[03:29.620 --> 03:31.620]  I can make up words if I want to.
[03:31.620 --> 03:33.220]  All right, you guys, thanks for joining me.
[03:33.220 --> 03:34.140]  Before we get too far,
[03:34.140 --> 03:35.780]  this podcast is brought to you by our friends
[03:35.780 --> 03:37.100]  at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[03:37.120 --> 03:39.640]  That's right, if you need to add some seeds to your lineup,
[03:39.640 --> 03:42.040]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Bank
[03:42.040 --> 03:44.240]  at dankseed.store.
[03:44.240 --> 03:46.900]  They've got all of the fresh iReed Genetics drops,
[03:46.900 --> 03:51.360]  so check them out at dankseed.store.
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.160]  All right, speaking of dank stuff,
[03:53.160 --> 03:56.880]  I recently found out that the crew at Rare Dankness
[03:56.880 --> 03:59.020]  listens to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[03:59.020 --> 04:00.520]  in their facility while they're working.
[04:00.520 --> 04:02.320]  I don't know if they're listening in the grow.
[04:02.320 --> 04:03.800]  I don't know if they're listening in the trim area.
[04:03.800 --> 04:05.400]  I don't know if they're listening in the package area.
[04:05.420 --> 04:07.460]  I don't know if it's being played in the retail area,
[04:07.460 --> 04:10.140]  but wherever it is being played, I am honored.
[04:10.140 --> 04:11.740]  Thank you guys.
[04:11.740 --> 04:15.060]  The Rare Dankness facility is the most impressive,
[04:15.060 --> 04:17.140]  most well thought out, most well designed,
[04:17.140 --> 04:19.580]  and most well run facility in Colorado,
[04:19.580 --> 04:21.460]  in my opinion, to the best of my knowledge.
[04:21.460 --> 04:22.760]  There may be something bigger, better,
[04:22.760 --> 04:25.580]  badder, shinier out there, but I don't know what it is.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.860]  I haven't seen or heard of it yet,
[04:26.860 --> 04:29.460]  so somebody pointed it out to me so I can be fucking amazed,
[04:29.460 --> 04:33.060]  but they're listening to my podcast in that facility,
[04:33.060 --> 04:34.260]  and that means a lot to me.
[04:34.280 --> 04:37.160]  It means a lot because Scott is a pioneer.
[04:37.160 --> 04:38.720]  Scott is a leader in the industry,
[04:38.720 --> 04:40.840]  and if his crew is listening to me,
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.080]  that means I'm doing something right
[04:42.080 --> 04:43.360]  because they've got all the knowledge
[04:43.360 --> 04:44.920]  they need at their fingertips.
[04:44.920 --> 04:46.840]  Scott is a weed wizard.
[04:46.840 --> 04:49.640]  Scott is every bit as qualified to educate
[04:49.640 --> 04:52.240]  and talk about cannabis as myself, if not more.
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.680]  Scott used to be on the forums.
[04:53.680 --> 04:55.400]  Scott's wife used to be on the forums,
[04:55.400 --> 04:57.920]  and I used to read their posts and learn from them.
[04:57.920 --> 05:00.280]  I'm sure they were reading mine and learning from me as well,
[05:00.280 --> 05:02.160]  but I was learning from Scott,
[05:02.180 --> 05:04.020]  and now Scott's crew,
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.500]  I don't know if Scott's doing it personally,
[05:05.500 --> 05:08.860]  but Scott's crew is listening to my podcast in Scott's Grow,
[05:08.860 --> 05:10.100]  so that's an honor to me.
[05:10.100 --> 05:11.300]  That means a lot to me.
[05:11.300 --> 05:12.940]  I'll quit gushing and rambling about it,
[05:12.940 --> 05:16.420]  but huge shout out to everybody at Rare Dankness.
[05:16.420 --> 05:17.420]  If you guys are ever in Denver,
[05:17.420 --> 05:19.860]  make sure you check out the House of Dankness.
[05:19.860 --> 05:22.660]  They were voted the best dispensary on the planet
[05:22.660 --> 05:23.780]  by High Times Magazine,
[05:23.780 --> 05:26.420]  so drop in, see what they've got going on.
[05:26.420 --> 05:28.180]  All right, you guys, I have got a couple of emails
[05:28.180 --> 05:29.380]  I would like to read.
[05:29.380 --> 05:31.780]  The first one goes like this.
[05:31.800 --> 05:32.920]  What up, Rasta Jeff?
[05:32.920 --> 05:35.640]  I just dropped $20 into the Patreon account.
[05:35.640 --> 05:39.160]  Hey guys, that is a good way to get me to read your email
[05:39.160 --> 05:40.600]  right away on a podcast.
[05:40.600 --> 05:41.440]  Just a hint.
[05:41.440 --> 05:43.680]  Anyway, he says, thanks for all the grow info
[05:43.680 --> 05:45.960]  and entertainment on the GFYH podcast.
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.040]  One quick question.
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.000]  I remember you talking in the past
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.280]  about mixing different pest control applications
[05:51.280 --> 05:53.540]  with other beneficial additives.
[05:53.540 --> 05:56.240]  Can you review some of your best practices?
[05:56.240 --> 05:59.000]  Keep twisting them dreads and smoking the bread.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.120]  Thanks, brother.
[06:00.140 --> 06:01.220]  Then he signs the email,
[06:01.220 --> 06:06.060]  Chef DHO of Kush Culinary in Los Angeles.
[06:06.060 --> 06:08.140]  So Chef DHO is correct.
[06:08.140 --> 06:10.740]  I have talked about mixing different pesticides
[06:10.740 --> 06:13.120]  and different beneficials into a sprayer
[06:13.120 --> 06:14.980]  and applying them at one time.
[06:14.980 --> 06:16.220]  That's called a tank mix.
[06:17.100 --> 06:20.740]  That is very doable, very reliable.
[06:20.740 --> 06:24.740]  It's actually a common practice in the agricultural world.
[06:24.740 --> 06:26.460]  If you're really working on keeping pests
[06:26.460 --> 06:27.300]  out of your garden,
[06:27.300 --> 06:31.240]  the best way to do it is through multiple modes of attack,
[06:31.240 --> 06:34.200]  which is using different types of pesticides
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.960]  that will attack in different directions.
[06:35.960 --> 06:38.080]  If I stomp on your foot and punch you in the nose
[06:38.080 --> 06:40.240]  and stab you in the stomach all at the same time,
[06:40.240 --> 06:42.060]  you're not sure which to block.
[06:42.060 --> 06:44.320]  So if you come at your pests the same way,
[06:44.320 --> 06:46.160]  they're not gonna wanna come around.
[06:46.160 --> 06:49.080]  You need to hit them with multiple modes of attack
[06:49.080 --> 06:51.020]  and figure out the ways to develop
[06:51.020 --> 06:53.060]  the least amount of resistance.
[06:53.060 --> 06:55.400]  The way to do that is to mix multiple things
[06:55.420 --> 06:57.900]  into a tank and spray it at the same time.
[06:57.900 --> 06:59.860]  Now you can mix a lot of different products.
[06:59.860 --> 07:02.020]  You just have to be careful and make sure
[07:02.020 --> 07:04.420]  that you're not going to cause a chemical reaction.
[07:04.420 --> 07:06.900]  So before you mix anything into a tank,
[07:06.900 --> 07:08.220]  okay, let me back up.
[07:08.220 --> 07:10.980]  Before you even start playing with pesticides,
[07:10.980 --> 07:14.700]  read the label carefully on every pesticide
[07:14.700 --> 07:16.020]  you are going to use.
[07:16.020 --> 07:17.740]  Read the application rates.
[07:17.740 --> 07:20.020]  Read about the personal protective equipment
[07:20.020 --> 07:21.400]  that is required.
[07:21.400 --> 07:23.340]  That stuff is very serious.
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.500]  Ask Elijah.
[07:24.500 --> 07:26.800]  Elijah was exposed to a pesticide
[07:26.800 --> 07:28.800]  and his whole body broke out in hives
[07:28.800 --> 07:30.840]  and he was itchy and he had a fever
[07:30.840 --> 07:32.720]  and he looked uncomfortable and scared.
[07:32.720 --> 07:34.760]  That was a very minor exposure.
[07:34.760 --> 07:36.320]  We don't know what the long-term effects
[07:36.320 --> 07:37.860]  of that exposure was.
[07:37.860 --> 07:38.900]  It happened immediately.
[07:38.900 --> 07:41.160]  He touched the pesticide, the shit grew on his skin,
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.580]  it went fucking crazy.
[07:42.580 --> 07:44.240]  We don't know if something's gonna come up
[07:44.240 --> 07:45.120]  in the future from that.
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.880]  He should be fine, but he could have problems
[07:47.880 --> 07:49.080]  and we do not know it.
[07:49.080 --> 07:50.600]  So please be very careful
[07:50.600 --> 07:52.200]  with personal protective equipment
[07:52.220 --> 07:56.620]  where everything requires pants and long sleeves and gloves.
[07:56.620 --> 07:58.180]  Wear at least that.
[07:58.180 --> 07:59.340]  Wear eye protection.
[07:59.340 --> 08:01.300]  As soon as you go, before you pick up a bottle,
[08:01.300 --> 08:02.300]  you should have eye protection.
[08:02.300 --> 08:03.760]  You could not have the lid on all the way
[08:03.760 --> 08:06.260]  and shake it and put that shit right in your eye.
[08:06.260 --> 08:08.100]  You haven't even thought you were gonna unscrew the bottle
[08:08.100 --> 08:10.160]  and you've already fucking got stuff in your eyes.
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.900]  Wear eye protection, please.
[08:11.900 --> 08:14.200]  Wear extra personal protective equipment.
[08:14.200 --> 08:16.100]  You can't go too far.
[08:16.100 --> 08:19.220]  What's extra goggles, a respirator, a bunny suit,
[08:19.220 --> 08:21.220]  extra gloves, how can that be a problem?
[08:21.240 --> 08:23.400]  Cover up excessively if you need to.
[08:23.400 --> 08:25.320]  So no matter what you're mixing,
[08:25.320 --> 08:27.680]  use the proper personal protective equipment.
[08:27.680 --> 08:32.180]  Also, read the label of whatever product you are using.
[08:32.180 --> 08:33.680]  Read the application rates.
[08:33.680 --> 08:35.600]  Read what to do if you get it in your eyes.
[08:35.600 --> 08:37.880]  Read what to do if you swallow some of it.
[08:37.880 --> 08:40.480]  See how dangerous the product you are working with is.
[08:40.480 --> 08:41.800]  See how toxic it is.
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.800]  See what kind of problems it could cause you.
[08:43.800 --> 08:45.920]  Maybe if you're alone and you're gardening,
[08:45.920 --> 08:47.680]  let somebody know that you're going to apply
[08:47.680 --> 08:49.280]  these pesticides and that maybe
[08:49.280 --> 08:51.340]  if they don't hear from you in an hour,
[08:51.340 --> 08:52.740]  somebody should check on you.
[08:52.740 --> 08:55.020]  Do something like that just to be safe.
[08:55.020 --> 08:57.420]  I seriously know a guy who was mixing his nutrients
[08:57.420 --> 08:59.460]  and got a product in his eyes
[08:59.460 --> 09:02.380]  and had to call 911 with Siri.
[09:02.380 --> 09:04.380]  He had to unlock his phone with his thumbprint
[09:04.380 --> 09:07.740]  and have Siri call 911 and come to his house and help him.
[09:07.740 --> 09:09.100]  And the first thing they wanted to know
[09:09.100 --> 09:10.940]  was what did you get in your eyes?
[09:10.940 --> 09:12.560]  That was the first question they asked.
[09:12.560 --> 09:14.260]  And he said it's the bottle on the counter.
[09:14.260 --> 09:16.420]  So have the bottle, if something goes wrong,
[09:16.420 --> 09:17.260]  don't put the bottle away.
[09:17.260 --> 09:19.560]  Have the bottle out to where if something does go wrong,
[09:19.560 --> 09:20.600]  that you can get the proper help.
[09:20.600 --> 09:21.820]  I don't want anything bad to happen to you,
[09:21.820 --> 09:23.160]  but if something does happen,
[09:23.160 --> 09:24.540]  we want to be able to help as quickly
[09:24.540 --> 09:25.880]  and effectively as possible.
[09:25.880 --> 09:28.160]  So have the bottle where it is findable.
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.640]  If you're mixing several bottles,
[09:29.640 --> 09:31.240]  leave those out until you're done.
[09:31.240 --> 09:33.120]  Until you're, I know it sounds weird.
[09:33.120 --> 09:33.960]  Leave them out until you're done.
[09:33.960 --> 09:34.780]  I don't want you to make a mess,
[09:34.780 --> 09:35.620]  but leave them out until you're done.
[09:35.620 --> 09:37.240]  In case something goes wrong, somebody can say,
[09:37.240 --> 09:39.640]  maybe he was using this pile of bottles right here.
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.760]  Just try to help yourself out.
[09:40.760 --> 09:43.000]  So read the fucking label, you guys.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.920]  That's always super important.
[09:44.920 --> 09:46.440]  Use the proper protective equipment.
[09:46.460 --> 09:49.220]  Now, if you're going to mix pesticides,
[09:49.220 --> 09:50.860]  find the application rate.
[09:50.860 --> 09:54.100]  If it says use this many milliliters per gallon,
[09:54.100 --> 09:56.780]  pour yourself a half a gallon of water into a container.
[09:56.780 --> 09:59.020]  Use half of that or half of the dosage.
[09:59.020 --> 10:00.020]  Pour it into there.
[10:00.020 --> 10:01.180]  Mix it like you're supposed to.
[10:01.180 --> 10:03.340]  Give it a couple of minutes to emulsify.
[10:03.340 --> 10:04.300]  Let it get in there.
[10:04.300 --> 10:06.540]  Now, if you're going to add another pesticide
[10:06.540 --> 10:08.100]  or another fungicide,
[10:08.100 --> 10:09.980]  apply that at half the rate that you intend
[10:09.980 --> 10:12.180]  or at half of the dosage recommended on the bottle
[10:12.180 --> 10:14.300]  or half of whatever you're going to use per gallon.
[10:14.300 --> 10:16.140]  Put it in a half gallon of water.
[10:16.840 --> 10:17.680]  Mix it up.
[10:17.680 --> 10:19.320]  See if those two things do anything.
[10:19.320 --> 10:22.760]  If it makes gas or bubbles or sizzles,
[10:22.760 --> 10:25.920]  or if it burns your lungs or eyes, get rid of it.
[10:25.920 --> 10:26.760]  I don't know what you're going to do.
[10:26.760 --> 10:28.320]  Hopefully you're doing this outside,
[10:28.320 --> 10:29.480]  but get rid of it safely.
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.880]  You don't want to apply that shit to your plants.
[10:31.880 --> 10:33.320]  You've only got a half a gallon to work with.
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.960]  Maybe a quarter gallon is smarter for this,
[10:34.960 --> 10:37.740]  but I don't have a quarter gallon container.
[10:37.740 --> 10:40.120]  But be careful.
[10:40.120 --> 10:43.440]  Test it before you mix shit together in a large batch.
[10:43.460 --> 10:46.740]  You can probably mix most of your common pesticides together
[10:46.740 --> 10:49.460]  but a lot of them are oily and it's going to get really thick
[10:49.460 --> 10:51.380]  if you go mixing a bunch of things.
[10:51.380 --> 10:53.900]  What this listener is asking about mainly,
[10:53.900 --> 10:55.820]  he said, remember me talking about
[10:55.820 --> 10:57.860]  mixing different pest control applications
[10:57.860 --> 11:00.480]  with beneficial additives.
[11:00.480 --> 11:01.700]  I know what you're talking about.
[11:01.700 --> 11:05.220]  I will mix evergreen or Azomax,
[11:05.220 --> 11:08.580]  and I will also mix push from hydroponic research
[11:08.580 --> 11:09.420]  or Vegbloom.
[11:09.420 --> 11:10.780]  Vegbloom is their company
[11:10.780 --> 11:12.200]  and it's made by hydroponic research.
[11:12.200 --> 11:14.600]  I will mix push in there with my pesticides.
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.720]  And now this is where you have to read.
[11:17.720 --> 11:20.040]  You have to read the product label
[11:20.040 --> 11:23.120]  and see if there's something in your one product
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.780]  that is going to destroy the other product.
[11:24.780 --> 11:26.040]  Let's talk about powdery mildew.
[11:26.040 --> 11:27.520]  This is a very good example
[11:27.520 --> 11:29.320]  that I can come up with off the top of my head.
[11:29.320 --> 11:30.200]  Powdery mildew.
[11:31.480 --> 11:34.360]  Early in flower, I would spray powdery mildew
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.840]  with cease and double nickel.
[11:36.840 --> 11:38.320]  Those would be my two go-to products
[11:38.320 --> 11:39.760]  to take down powdery mildew.
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.460]  Cease and double nickel.
[11:41.460 --> 11:42.580]  This is great information.
[11:42.580 --> 11:44.060]  Write this down if you'd like.
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.240]  I would do 45 milliliters of cease per gallon
[11:47.240 --> 11:50.500]  and 45 milliliters of double nickel per gallon,
[11:50.500 --> 11:51.660]  and I would spray it,
[11:51.660 --> 11:53.060]  and I would use kind of an aggressive,
[11:53.060 --> 11:53.900]  I use a paint sprayer,
[11:53.900 --> 11:56.160]  and I would put it at sort of an aggressive setting
[11:56.160 --> 11:57.820]  and try to hose the shit out of the plants
[11:57.820 --> 12:00.500]  and knock that PM off and also destroy and leave.
[12:00.500 --> 12:02.140]  So what the cease and the nickel are doing
[12:02.140 --> 12:03.620]  is they are beneficial bacteria
[12:03.620 --> 12:05.580]  that will leave a layer on the plants
[12:05.580 --> 12:07.940]  and disrupt the growth of the powdery mildew.
[12:07.940 --> 12:10.540]  These beneficial bacteria do not harm the plants
[12:10.540 --> 12:12.700]  or people, and they won't cause the problems
[12:12.700 --> 12:13.940]  that the powdery mildew will cause,
[12:13.940 --> 12:15.820]  and they will not allow the powdery mildew
[12:15.820 --> 12:17.580]  to colonize on your plants.
[12:17.580 --> 12:20.660]  So you're applying bacterias that are helpful,
[12:20.660 --> 12:23.300]  and they will destroy the bacteria we do not want there.
[12:23.300 --> 12:26.220]  Okay, now, later in flower,
[12:26.220 --> 12:28.420]  you're gonna, if the powdery mildew gets thicker,
[12:28.420 --> 12:31.060]  you're gonna wanna use a product called Xerotol.
[12:31.060 --> 12:35.460]  Xerotol is, it's a mixture of basically vinegar
[12:35.460 --> 12:37.020]  and hydrogen peroxide,
[12:37.020 --> 12:39.960]  and it smells like dirty feet and assholes and a gym,
[12:39.960 --> 12:40.920]  and it's disgusting,
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.560]  but it dissolves powdery mildew on contact.
[12:44.560 --> 12:46.120]  It has to touch the powdery mildew,
[12:46.120 --> 12:47.080]  but it will dissolve it.
[12:47.080 --> 12:48.720]  It will destroy it.
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.200]  Unfortunately, it also will destroy double nickel.
[12:53.200 --> 12:55.400]  The beneficial bacteria in double nickel
[12:55.400 --> 12:58.440]  would be destroyed by Xerotol,
[12:58.440 --> 13:01.380]  but the beneficial bacteria in cease
[13:01.380 --> 13:03.760]  will not be destroyed by Xerotol.
[13:03.760 --> 13:07.520]  So you can mix cease and Xerotol in a sprayer together
[13:07.520 --> 13:08.360]  and apply them,
[13:08.360 --> 13:10.920]  but mixing nickel and Xerotol together
[13:10.920 --> 13:12.960]  would be a waste of your money.
[13:12.960 --> 13:14.280]  So those are things to think about
[13:14.280 --> 13:17.400]  when it comes to mixing pesticides and fungicides.
[13:17.400 --> 13:20.480]  Now, the Xerotol, you spray that on the plants,
[13:20.480 --> 13:23.500]  and it basically destroys the powdery mildew that's there,
[13:23.500 --> 13:27.600]  and since it's a vinegar and basically hydrogen peroxide,
[13:27.600 --> 13:28.640]  it's not exactly what it is,
[13:28.640 --> 13:29.480]  but it's what it smells like,
[13:29.480 --> 13:30.880]  and that's basically what it is.
[13:30.880 --> 13:32.000]  Since it's those two products,
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.360]  they dissolve and dissipate and break down
[13:34.360 --> 13:36.280]  and disappear very quickly.
[13:36.280 --> 13:38.480]  So then you can destroy the powdery mildew
[13:38.480 --> 13:41.000]  with the Xerotol and the cease application,
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.960]  and then you can go back in a couple of days
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.660]  and you can actually apply the cease and double nickel again
[13:45.660 --> 13:48.400]  to colonize and help keep down the powdery mildew,
[13:48.400 --> 13:49.980]  if you feel as you've knocked it out
[13:49.980 --> 13:51.360]  with the first Xerotol application.
[13:51.360 --> 13:53.360]  If not, go back with the Xerotol,
[13:53.360 --> 13:55.880]  maybe increase it a little bit, but not too much,
[13:55.880 --> 13:58.280]  do the Xerotol and the cease application again,
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.580]  and hopefully you can get that powdery mildew under control.
[14:00.580 --> 14:02.840]  But those are things you can mix together.
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.820]  Cease and double nickel, you can mix those together.
[14:06.360 --> 14:09.020]  Double nickel and Xerotol wouldn't work for you.
[14:09.020 --> 14:11.620]  Cease and Xerotol, that's gonna work well for you.
[14:12.460 --> 14:15.580]  Other pesticides that I have had good experience
[14:15.580 --> 14:19.420]  tank mixing together have been things like
[14:19.420 --> 14:23.340]  Venerate, double nickel, and Push.
[14:23.340 --> 14:26.560]  That is a very good spray for preventatives
[14:26.560 --> 14:28.860]  for almost all insects.
[14:28.860 --> 14:31.300]  I also like, I'm trying not to give away
[14:31.300 --> 14:32.340]  too many of my secrets here,
[14:32.340 --> 14:34.900]  but I'd like to share some stuff.
[14:35.100 --> 14:36.900]  Here's a good example of an actual spray
[14:36.900 --> 14:39.120]  that I would apply to veg plants
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.260]  that has a lot of products in it, but will work for you.
[14:42.260 --> 14:45.940]  I would do, should I tell you how many milliliters?
[14:45.940 --> 14:49.140]  Sure, 15 milliliters of Evergreen,
[14:49.140 --> 14:52.780]  50 milliliters of Push from Vegbloom,
[14:52.780 --> 14:55.420]  30 milliliters of Venerate,
[14:55.420 --> 14:58.300]  45 milliliters of double nickel,
[14:58.300 --> 15:01.260]  and two mils of CalMag per gallon.
[15:02.100 --> 15:03.820]  Now I know that sounds like a lot of products,
[15:03.820 --> 15:06.740]  but you're gonna be hitting pests from multiple angles,
[15:06.740 --> 15:09.020]  and then spray them again in a few days,
[15:09.020 --> 15:11.940]  and actually switch out the Evergreen
[15:11.940 --> 15:14.180]  and switch that for Azomax,
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.580]  and then drop the Venerate
[15:15.580 --> 15:17.740]  and switch it for Botanigard Max.
[15:17.740 --> 15:20.300]  And that way you are hitting at every angle,
[15:20.300 --> 15:21.140]  and then you're switching
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.860]  so you're not getting any resistance.
[15:22.860 --> 15:25.260]  And that's gonna take down just about any
[15:25.260 --> 15:27.740]  bug infestation in your veg plants.
[15:27.740 --> 15:30.460]  Now, we are spraying pesticides.
[15:30.460 --> 15:33.780]  We have got, there's Evergreen in there,
[15:34.740 --> 15:36.020]  which is, what's it, Pyrethrums.
[15:36.020 --> 15:37.060]  We've got Venerate in there,
[15:37.060 --> 15:39.420]  which I don't even remember the active ingredient in there.
[15:39.420 --> 15:40.380]  We've got the double nickel,
[15:40.380 --> 15:41.700]  which is a beneficial bacteria
[15:41.700 --> 15:43.100]  which will prevent powdery mildew
[15:43.100 --> 15:45.500]  and also pisses off spider mites.
[15:45.500 --> 15:47.100]  But then we're adding the Push.
[15:47.100 --> 15:50.580]  The Push is a, what did you call it?
[15:50.580 --> 15:52.420]  A beneficial additive.
[15:52.420 --> 15:53.980]  The Push is a beneficial additive.
[15:53.980 --> 15:56.580]  The CalMag is also a beneficial additive.
[15:56.580 --> 15:59.660]  So we're mixing those in right on in with the pesticides.
[15:59.660 --> 16:01.100]  When I was a new grower,
[16:01.100 --> 16:02.580]  I would wanna spray multiple things.
[16:02.620 --> 16:05.700]  I was like, well, I wanna spray my plants with this.
[16:05.700 --> 16:06.980]  I don't even remember what product it was,
[16:06.980 --> 16:09.180]  but I was like, I also have to hit them for pesticides,
[16:09.180 --> 16:10.620]  which means I have to hit them today
[16:10.620 --> 16:12.340]  and tomorrow with a fuller feed.
[16:12.340 --> 16:14.900]  I didn't even realize I could just tank mix all that shit.
[16:14.900 --> 16:16.820]  So it took a long time for me to realize
[16:16.820 --> 16:19.620]  you could just mix it all into one tank, mix it up,
[16:19.620 --> 16:21.260]  maybe put a little Cocoa Wed in there
[16:21.260 --> 16:23.300]  to make it stick to the leaves a little bit better,
[16:23.300 --> 16:25.700]  and then just blast it on the plants all at one time.
[16:25.700 --> 16:27.900]  Now, something you will need to think about,
[16:29.220 --> 16:31.500]  some oily products and sulfur products
[16:31.540 --> 16:33.260]  will cause you problems.
[16:33.260 --> 16:35.500]  Don't spray all of the plants right away.
[16:35.500 --> 16:37.580]  Maybe mix up a small batch with a pump spray
[16:37.580 --> 16:38.780]  or with a hand sprayer,
[16:38.780 --> 16:41.220]  and then go spray one or two plants with your new product
[16:41.220 --> 16:43.460]  and see if you're gonna destroy anything
[16:43.460 --> 16:45.860]  because it is plant sensitive.
[16:45.860 --> 16:47.020]  It is grow room sensitive.
[16:47.020 --> 16:48.860]  I don't know the health of your plants
[16:48.860 --> 16:50.100]  that you're starting with.
[16:50.100 --> 16:55.100]  So be careful, mix a test batch, spray a test plant,
[16:55.580 --> 16:56.980]  spray your plants in the dark.
[16:56.980 --> 16:59.340]  If you've got one plant that you're gonna test spray,
[16:59.340 --> 17:00.540]  pull it out of the grow area,
[17:00.540 --> 17:03.540]  get it away from the lights, spray that plant by itself.
[17:03.540 --> 17:05.660]  Make sure you wear all of the personal protective equipment
[17:05.660 --> 17:06.500]  that you need.
[17:06.500 --> 17:09.420]  And I highly recommend that you write down
[17:09.420 --> 17:13.540]  exactly how many milliliters of each product that you used
[17:13.540 --> 17:18.100]  and write down the date that you applied those products.
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.140]  Also, since I'm on this trip,
[17:20.140 --> 17:21.580]  think about what you're spraying.
[17:21.580 --> 17:24.020]  I only apply products that are approved
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.900]  by the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[17:25.900 --> 17:27.820]  and the Colorado MED.
[17:27.820 --> 17:32.300]  I have a personal grow that is not part of the MED grow
[17:32.300 --> 17:34.300]  that I still use those practices in.
[17:34.300 --> 17:36.180]  Any personal garden that I help with,
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.100]  that I run myself or that I set up,
[17:38.100 --> 17:40.940]  I encourage everybody to follow MED
[17:40.940 --> 17:42.700]  and Department of Agriculture guidelines
[17:42.700 --> 17:44.700]  because that's what we're going to have to do
[17:44.700 --> 17:46.880]  in the future anyway.
[17:46.880 --> 17:48.860]  So I guess to make a long story short,
[17:48.860 --> 17:51.580]  yeah, you can tank mix a bunch of shit together.
[17:51.580 --> 17:55.060]  Just test it first and test it on a test plant
[17:55.060 --> 17:56.820]  before you spray the whole garden.
[17:56.820 --> 17:59.780]  You guys, I am not some sort of cannabis wizard
[17:59.780 --> 18:02.300]  or weed genius or ganja guru.
[18:02.300 --> 18:05.220]  I have simply tried a lot of shit.
[18:05.220 --> 18:06.100]  You would be amazed.
[18:06.100 --> 18:08.340]  I post pictures of great things on Instagram.
[18:08.340 --> 18:10.800]  I post pictures of my successes.
[18:10.800 --> 18:13.420]  I talk about and brag about my wins.
[18:13.420 --> 18:17.800]  I don't share my loses, my loses, fucking see,
[18:17.800 --> 18:18.860]  I'm gonna leave that one right there.
[18:18.860 --> 18:21.780]  I don't share my losses and my failures with you guys.
[18:21.780 --> 18:23.780]  So you've got to keep in mind
[18:23.780 --> 18:26.220]  for every three cool things you see that I post,
[18:26.620 --> 18:29.500]  there were probably 10 or 20 things that I fucked up.
[18:29.500 --> 18:32.020]  And that's how I learned how to do those three cool things.
[18:32.020 --> 18:35.140]  So don't be afraid to expand your knowledge
[18:35.140 --> 18:36.740]  by fucking up a little bit.
[18:36.740 --> 18:39.860]  If you make mistakes and you learn along the way
[18:39.860 --> 18:43.420]  and you are making mistakes because you're trying new shit,
[18:43.420 --> 18:45.140]  you're not making mistakes,
[18:45.140 --> 18:46.860]  you just haven't found the exact way
[18:46.860 --> 18:49.420]  to do what you were thinking of yet.
[18:49.420 --> 18:50.860]  So if you're learning to ride a skateboard
[18:50.860 --> 18:52.540]  and you're trying to do a kickflip,
[18:52.540 --> 18:53.620]  you'd have to learn how to ollie
[18:53.620 --> 18:54.940]  and get that board up off the ground.
[18:54.940 --> 18:56.140]  And then once you got it up off the ground,
[18:56.980 --> 18:57.820]  you gotta learn how to flip it.
[18:57.820 --> 18:58.640]  And then once you get it flipping,
[18:58.640 --> 19:01.660]  you gotta learn how to get your feet back on it and land it.
[19:01.660 --> 19:03.900]  Those first hundred kickflips are gonna suck
[19:03.900 --> 19:05.100]  and you're not gonna know what you're doing,
[19:05.100 --> 19:06.700]  but you're not failing.
[19:06.700 --> 19:08.400]  You just haven't got there yet.
[19:08.400 --> 19:09.500]  You gotta land one.
[19:09.500 --> 19:11.980]  And then once you land one, now you can do kickflips
[19:11.980 --> 19:13.300]  and now you just gotta perfect it.
[19:13.300 --> 19:15.760]  So start throwing them kickflips in the grow, you guys.
[19:15.760 --> 19:17.540]  Quit skating in straight lines
[19:17.540 --> 19:19.440]  because your grow is never gonna look any different.
[19:19.440 --> 19:21.100]  It's not gonna get any better.
[19:21.100 --> 19:22.540]  Your skills aren't gonna advance.
[19:22.540 --> 19:25.260]  You're just gonna be doing the same old thing forever.
[19:25.260 --> 19:26.580]  Start throwing some kickflips.
[19:26.580 --> 19:28.380]  You're gonna crash a couple of times.
[19:28.380 --> 19:29.220]  You're gonna fall down.
[19:29.220 --> 19:30.340]  You're gonna get a bloody knee,
[19:30.340 --> 19:32.500]  but you know what happens when you fall down
[19:32.500 --> 19:33.740]  when you're growing weed?
[19:33.740 --> 19:34.820]  You kill a couple of plants.
[19:34.820 --> 19:35.820]  You throw them away.
[19:35.820 --> 19:36.940]  You're gonna buy more dirt.
[19:36.940 --> 19:37.980]  Fucking try it again.
[19:37.980 --> 19:39.420]  It doesn't hurt nearly as bad
[19:39.420 --> 19:42.180]  as when you crash when you're skateboarding.
[19:42.180 --> 19:43.980]  That's my pep talk for today, you guys.
[19:43.980 --> 19:45.500]  All right, let's continue with the podcast.
[19:45.500 --> 19:47.060]  I've got another great email.
[19:47.060 --> 19:49.660]  Hey, I wanna say a huge thank you to my friend,
[19:49.660 --> 19:52.700]  Chef DHO of Kush Culinary in Los Angeles.
[19:52.740 --> 19:56.140]  Chef, you threw down $20 in my Patreon account.
[19:56.140 --> 19:56.980]  Thank you, dude.
[19:56.980 --> 19:59.140]  I appreciate your support.
[19:59.140 --> 20:00.980]  If anybody else out there would like to send me an email,
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.900]  it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[20:02.900 --> 20:05.420]  Also, if you'd like to check out the Patreon campaign,
[20:05.420 --> 20:08.380]  just go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[20:08.380 --> 20:13.380]  Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N.com slash growfromyourheart.
[20:14.820 --> 20:15.740]  All right, I've got another email.
[20:15.740 --> 20:17.260]  This one comes from a listener
[20:17.260 --> 20:19.620]  who called themselves Senior Smith.
[20:19.620 --> 20:22.020]  The subject is big fan, need help,
[20:22.060 --> 20:23.460]  and it goes like this.
[20:23.460 --> 20:26.020]  First off, thank you for all you do for the community.
[20:26.020 --> 20:27.660]  You've helped me in a lot.
[20:27.660 --> 20:29.340]  You've helped me a lot in my pursuit
[20:29.340 --> 20:31.220]  of good, wholesome, natural medicine.
[20:31.220 --> 20:32.820]  Okay, now for my question.
[20:32.820 --> 20:35.020]  Dude, first off, you're very welcome.
[20:35.020 --> 20:36.500]  Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[20:36.500 --> 20:40.740]  I'm glad that I was able to help you in your pursuit
[20:40.740 --> 20:42.780]  for natural, wholesome medicine.
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.300]  So the question goes like this.
[20:44.300 --> 20:46.720]  I have a real problem when it comes to anxiety.
[20:46.720 --> 20:47.920]  What strains would you recommend
[20:47.920 --> 20:49.360]  for dealing with this affliction?
[20:49.360 --> 20:51.620]  I've had folks tell me this and that,
[20:52.220 --> 20:53.580]  but I really don't trust what they've told me.
[20:53.580 --> 20:54.980]  I've done some research myself,
[20:54.980 --> 20:58.300]  but I just wanted to know if you know anyone personally
[20:58.300 --> 21:00.520]  that battles with this and what they use.
[21:00.520 --> 21:02.860]  Any help would greatly be appreciated.
[21:02.860 --> 21:04.620]  Thanks again in advance.
[21:04.620 --> 21:05.900]  And then he also says you answered
[21:05.900 --> 21:08.260]  an Instagram question for me once before.
[21:08.260 --> 21:09.700]  Hey, Senior Smith, I'm glad I was able
[21:09.700 --> 21:11.340]  to help you out on Instagram.
[21:11.340 --> 21:13.560]  Thank you for the email, and I'm glad I'm able
[21:13.560 --> 21:15.640]  to get this opportunity to help you out again
[21:15.640 --> 21:17.940]  because this is something a lot of people deal with.
[21:17.960 --> 21:22.180]  Anxiety seems to be sweeping our nation,
[21:22.180 --> 21:23.300]  our community, our world.
[21:23.300 --> 21:25.500]  Everybody is getting anxious, and why not?
[21:25.500 --> 21:28.180]  Because the world is getting fucking crazy right now.
[21:28.180 --> 21:30.220]  I understand why people are anxious.
[21:30.220 --> 21:31.500]  I'm anxious.
[21:31.500 --> 21:34.420]  You asked, do you know anybody personally
[21:34.420 --> 21:36.060]  that battles with this and what they use?
[21:36.060 --> 21:37.280]  Yes, me, dude.
[21:37.280 --> 21:38.220]  I am anxious.
[21:38.220 --> 21:40.700]  I am a nervous fucking wreck sometimes.
[21:40.700 --> 21:41.580]  I know why.
[21:41.580 --> 21:43.540]  It's because I've got a brain injury,
[21:43.540 --> 21:47.220]  and also some things in the past give me anxiety.
[21:47.540 --> 21:50.300]  I've got anxiety, so I know how to talk about this.
[21:50.300 --> 21:54.020]  Before I get into recommending strains for your anxiety,
[21:54.020 --> 21:59.020]  let me say that not all people have the same body chemistry.
[21:59.020 --> 22:03.360]  Not all strains work the same for all consumers.
[22:04.500 --> 22:08.540]  I like really strong sativas for my anxiety,
[22:08.540 --> 22:10.540]  but I've got a traumatic brain injury,
[22:10.540 --> 22:15.460]  and sometimes I feel like the thoughts start on side A
[22:15.460 --> 22:17.300]  and just will not connect to side B,
[22:17.300 --> 22:19.220]  and somewhere in the middle there,
[22:19.220 --> 22:21.380]  the fucking telephone line is just crossing,
[22:21.380 --> 22:23.140]  and the information is just not getting
[22:23.140 --> 22:23.980]  to where it needs to be,
[22:23.980 --> 22:27.580]  and it starts making me anxious, and I get weird.
[22:27.580 --> 22:32.260]  And so I will smoke a dab of really high THC,
[22:32.260 --> 22:34.660]  really strong dabs,
[22:34.660 --> 22:38.660]  and I will feel that tangled telephone wire in my head.
[22:38.660 --> 22:40.660]  I'll feel that shit unravel,
[22:40.660 --> 22:41.740]  and all the connectors go,
[22:41.740 --> 22:43.580]  huh, now I know where I'm supposed to be going,
[22:43.580 --> 22:46.260]  and all the information can travel down the right pipeline.
[22:46.260 --> 22:49.420]  So for me, it's things like Lemon Jeffrey
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.260]  really helps out a lot.
[22:51.260 --> 22:53.140]  Almost anything lemon flavored.
[22:53.140 --> 22:56.420]  The lemon turps really seem to work well for that,
[22:56.420 --> 23:00.060]  and orange turps, extreme tangerines,
[23:00.060 --> 23:04.180]  screamin' tangerines, extreme oranges, tangy,
[23:05.020 --> 23:08.620]  jilly bean, those are things that really work for me.
[23:09.060 --> 23:14.220]  I've got a very dear friend
[23:14.220 --> 23:16.180]  who I don't want to call them out and say their name,
[23:16.180 --> 23:19.100]  but somebody really close to me has an anxiety issue,
[23:19.100 --> 23:21.980]  and they smoke the Clementine,
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.820]  and the Clementine is what they say
[23:23.820 --> 23:25.820]  stops their anxiety from happening.
[23:27.020 --> 23:28.780]  Now those are strong sativas
[23:28.780 --> 23:31.380]  that seem to work for me and somebody else.
[23:32.900 --> 23:34.860]  I'm not sure your body chemistry.
[23:35.620 --> 23:39.180]  Some of those sativas are going to give people anxiety,
[23:39.180 --> 23:41.540]  and if something, if you smoke jilly bean,
[23:41.540 --> 23:44.500]  or Lemon Jeffrey, or Clementine,
[23:44.500 --> 23:48.140]  or something in that realm, and it gives you anxiety,
[23:48.140 --> 23:49.500]  then you're gonna have to try something
[23:49.500 --> 23:51.180]  at the opposite end of the spectrum.
[23:51.180 --> 23:55.980]  I would try LA Confidential, Cataract Kush,
[23:55.980 --> 23:58.140]  something in that realm, Kosher Kush,
[23:58.140 --> 23:59.900]  and those are all three from DNA Genetics,
[23:59.900 --> 24:02.580]  but they're the opposite end of the spectrum.
[24:02.860 --> 24:05.660]  They're gonna be more sedative, more chill you out,
[24:05.660 --> 24:09.060]  more relax you, more put you on the couch kind of weed.
[24:10.100 --> 24:12.380]  What I think about smoking the sativas,
[24:12.380 --> 24:15.100]  and the Limonene, and the Terpenolene Terps,
[24:15.100 --> 24:18.100]  they're so uplifting that it just changes my mood
[24:18.100 --> 24:19.620]  to where I can't even be anxious.
[24:19.620 --> 24:22.700]  I'm just in a good mood, and my mind is firing so fast
[24:22.700 --> 24:24.740]  that I can't stick to an anxious thought.
[24:24.740 --> 24:26.780]  It's just fresh, like, oh, good mood.
[24:26.780 --> 24:27.620]  Well, I was anxious.
[24:27.620 --> 24:28.820]  Oh, no, I'm not, I'm in a good mood.
[24:28.820 --> 24:30.740]  I'm so high off this Lemon Jeffrey dab
[24:30.740 --> 24:32.100]  that I'm in a good mood.
[24:32.620 --> 24:34.740]  It's just motivating and uplifting.
[24:34.740 --> 24:39.580]  I feel the Lemon Jeffrey, Jilly Bean, Tangy, Clementine,
[24:39.580 --> 24:40.740]  a lot of strains like that,
[24:40.740 --> 24:44.440]  the fruity, orangey kind of things work with my anxiety.
[24:45.780 --> 24:47.940]  Some folks are gonna need that Indica stuff,
[24:47.940 --> 24:49.060]  and I'll repeat those strains.
[24:49.060 --> 24:53.580]  I said Kosher Kush, I said, what else did I say?
[24:53.580 --> 24:57.660]  Cataract Kush, and LA Confidential
[24:57.660 --> 25:00.060]  are the three from DNA Genetics
[25:00.060 --> 25:01.300]  that I think would work for you
[25:01.300 --> 25:03.380]  if the other end of the spectrum doesn't work.
[25:03.380 --> 25:04.900]  Now, you've got another option.
[25:05.760 --> 25:08.700]  If the Sativa and Indicas don't work for you,
[25:08.700 --> 25:11.220]  you can try CBD.
[25:11.220 --> 25:12.900]  You can find CBD isolates,
[25:12.900 --> 25:15.300]  or you can find CBD-heavy flowers.
[25:15.300 --> 25:20.300]  Strains that may be heavy in CBD are Tora Bora and Pennywise.
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.140]  Those are two really popular CBD strains.
[25:24.140 --> 25:26.780]  Also, there's the ACDC,
[25:26.780 --> 25:29.420]  which is really popular for being a CBD strain.
[25:29.420 --> 25:31.140]  I'm sure there are more out there.
[25:31.980 --> 25:34.980]  Things evolve every day, but you can get CBD isolates,
[25:34.980 --> 25:38.340]  you can get CBD flowers, you can get high CBD concentrates,
[25:38.340 --> 25:40.140]  you can get CBD tinctures,
[25:40.140 --> 25:42.700]  you can get CBD everything you could imagine.
[25:42.700 --> 25:45.500]  Just make sure it's coming from a source that is reputable
[25:45.500 --> 25:49.500]  and it's actually CBD and not some imported Chinese fish oil
[25:49.500 --> 25:51.300]  because you don't wanna take random chemicals
[25:51.300 --> 25:53.740]  from other countries, get some quality shit.
[25:54.660 --> 25:56.380]  So those are things I would recommend,
[25:56.380 --> 26:00.260]  and I know that that is not a direct science
[26:00.260 --> 26:02.420]  or a prescription, but that's the thing about cannabis
[26:02.420 --> 26:04.640]  and that's the thing about our bodies.
[26:04.640 --> 26:05.780]  And that's one of my favorite things
[26:05.780 --> 26:08.020]  about medicating with cannabis is
[26:08.020 --> 26:09.740]  when you go to the doctor, they say,
[26:09.740 --> 26:11.280]  you've got this condition,
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.860]  you take this pill this often at this rate.
[26:15.860 --> 26:16.940]  And they think it's gonna work
[26:16.940 --> 26:18.340]  based on everybody else's body.
[26:18.340 --> 26:21.700]  And yes, most of those prescriptions will work at that rate,
[26:21.700 --> 26:23.020]  at that dosage, at that interval,
[26:23.020 --> 26:24.800]  because they've done science to figure that out.
[26:24.800 --> 26:26.920]  Cannabis doesn't work that way.
[26:26.920 --> 26:28.820]  The thing about cannabis is we cannot,
[26:28.820 --> 26:30.820]  you can't kill yourself with cannabis.
[26:30.820 --> 26:33.460]  So you are able to be your own guinea pig
[26:33.460 --> 26:34.740]  and find out your thresholds.
[26:34.740 --> 26:39.520]  You can find out, I need six dabs every 22 minutes,
[26:39.520 --> 26:41.560]  and I need to smoke a sativa,
[26:41.560 --> 26:45.180]  and you can administer your medicine to yourself.
[26:45.180 --> 26:47.260]  And you can perfect your regimen,
[26:47.260 --> 26:48.460]  and you won't kill yourself.
[26:48.460 --> 26:50.860]  And you can stay pain-free or anxiety-free
[26:50.860 --> 26:53.580]  or whatever free, and you can be happy.
[26:53.580 --> 26:55.420]  That's one of the greatest things about cannabis.
[26:55.420 --> 26:57.420]  The downfall to that is I can't tell you,
[26:57.420 --> 27:00.060]  smoke a quarter gram dab of Jilly Bean every two hours.
[27:00.060 --> 27:01.660]  You're gonna have to dial that in yourself,
[27:01.660 --> 27:02.980]  which means, unfortunately,
[27:02.980 --> 27:04.680]  maybe you're gonna go smoke some Lemon Jeffery,
[27:04.680 --> 27:05.700]  and it's gonna fuck you up
[27:05.700 --> 27:06.980]  and give you the worst panic attack.
[27:06.980 --> 27:09.220]  And I'm sorry if that's what has to happen.
[27:09.220 --> 27:10.820]  But remember that.
[27:10.820 --> 27:12.860]  And then don't ever smoke Lemon Jeffery again,
[27:12.860 --> 27:14.660]  if that's the case.
[27:14.660 --> 27:17.420]  Then smoke LA Confidential and see if it helps.
[27:17.420 --> 27:21.840]  See if the LA Confidential makes you lazy or lethargic,
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.700]  or maybe it makes you creative and psychedelic
[27:23.700 --> 27:25.120]  and puts you in a good mood.
[27:25.120 --> 27:26.420]  But you're gonna have to try a couple of things
[27:26.460 --> 27:27.620]  at the opposite ends of the spectrum
[27:27.620 --> 27:29.220]  and see what works for you.
[27:29.220 --> 27:30.820]  I wish I knew your body chemistry better.
[27:30.820 --> 27:32.680]  I wish I knew exactly what to recommend.
[27:32.680 --> 27:34.220]  I believe that in the future,
[27:35.420 --> 27:37.700]  once we figure out what we like, I know what I like.
[27:37.700 --> 27:38.940]  I know my favorite terps.
[27:38.940 --> 27:40.500]  I know how much THC I like.
[27:40.500 --> 27:41.340]  I don't know exactly,
[27:41.340 --> 27:42.860]  but I mean, I have a good idea of what I like
[27:42.860 --> 27:45.180]  from the labeling that I've experienced
[27:45.180 --> 27:47.060]  and from the consuming that I've experienced.
[27:47.060 --> 27:48.900]  I've got a good idea of what works for me.
[27:48.900 --> 27:50.880]  I believe in the future,
[27:50.880 --> 27:53.820]  we'll be able to go to our dispensary and we'll say,
[27:53.900 --> 27:56.620]  hey, can I get a gram of this concentrate?
[27:56.620 --> 27:58.380]  And you'll hand him a card
[27:58.380 --> 28:00.420]  and it'll have your mix on it.
[28:00.420 --> 28:05.180]  It'll say like 97% THC with 2% terpeneline
[28:05.180 --> 28:07.040]  and 1% limonene.
[28:07.040 --> 28:11.340]  And then he's gonna give you this perfect homogenized dab.
[28:11.340 --> 28:14.260]  And you're just gonna be like, that's exactly what I needed.
[28:14.260 --> 28:16.420]  But still to get there, you're gonna have to experiment
[28:16.420 --> 28:19.580]  and figure out what you like and what works best for you.
[28:19.580 --> 28:20.640]  So like I keep repeating,
[28:20.640 --> 28:22.640]  I don't know the exact prescription
[28:22.640 --> 28:24.200]  or recommendation for you.
[28:24.200 --> 28:26.680]  I would start off by smoking flowers
[28:26.680 --> 28:27.920]  of multiple different strains.
[28:27.920 --> 28:28.940]  Just take one or two puffs.
[28:28.940 --> 28:31.460]  I don't know how experienced you are in cannabis,
[28:31.460 --> 28:33.680]  but I would definitely start light.
[28:33.680 --> 28:35.800]  Smoke a couple puffs of one strain.
[28:35.800 --> 28:38.160]  Pick one and stick with it for that session.
[28:38.160 --> 28:39.000]  You know what I mean?
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.060]  Go buy a bag of Jilly Bean, buy a bag of Lemon Jeffrey,
[28:41.060 --> 28:44.080]  buy a bag of LA Confidential, buy a bag of Cataract Kush.
[28:44.080 --> 28:46.200]  Smoke them at separate times
[28:46.200 --> 28:48.920]  so that you can tell exactly what each one is doing.
[28:48.920 --> 28:50.200]  Do your normal day.
[28:50.200 --> 28:51.600]  If you go to work and then come home
[28:51.600 --> 28:53.040]  and take off your shoes and take a poop
[28:53.040 --> 28:54.800]  and take a shower and pet the dog,
[28:54.800 --> 28:57.760]  after that routine happens, smoke your bowl.
[28:57.760 --> 28:59.600]  Then do the next routine tomorrow.
[28:59.600 --> 29:00.720]  Do the same exact thing.
[29:00.720 --> 29:01.720]  Smoke your bowl.
[29:01.720 --> 29:03.120]  Compare the two effects.
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.440]  See if the Jilly Bean made you giggly or paranoid
[29:05.440 --> 29:08.140]  and see if the LA Confidential made you lazy or paranoid.
[29:08.140 --> 29:08.980]  See what happens.
[29:09.880 --> 29:11.320]  Write it down if you're able.
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.800]  If you've got a partner that you can trust
[29:14.800 --> 29:15.880]  that will take notes for you,
[29:15.880 --> 29:16.960]  a lot of times I think it's cool
[29:16.960 --> 29:19.480]  because your girlfriend or a lot of times your companion
[29:19.480 --> 29:20.380]  will wanna be involved
[29:20.380 --> 29:22.060]  and they like taking notes and things.
[29:22.060 --> 29:24.540]  So that's a way you could bring them in on this
[29:24.540 --> 29:26.220]  is have them kind of observe
[29:26.220 --> 29:27.620]  and take notes about your progress
[29:27.620 --> 29:29.980]  and see if they feel like you were nicer
[29:29.980 --> 29:31.140]  or better to be around
[29:31.140 --> 29:33.420]  or maybe they had to talk you down
[29:33.420 --> 29:34.420]  and help you out or something.
[29:34.420 --> 29:35.860]  But it may be fun to have somebody around
[29:35.860 --> 29:37.420]  to take some notes for you.
[29:37.420 --> 29:38.640]  All right, Senior Smith.
[29:38.640 --> 29:40.860]  I feel like I've rambled a lot about your email
[29:40.860 --> 29:43.140]  but I don't feel like I've answered your question directly.
[29:43.140 --> 29:46.080]  I apologize that this is not something
[29:46.080 --> 29:48.020]  I can just answer really directly.
[29:48.020 --> 29:49.980]  This is gonna be based on your brain chemistry,
[29:50.580 --> 29:52.940]  your body chemistry, which flowers you choose.
[29:52.940 --> 29:54.340]  It's gonna take some dialing in.
[29:54.340 --> 29:57.260]  So if you want to message me,
[29:57.260 --> 29:59.220]  try the strains that I recommended.
[29:59.220 --> 30:00.460]  And if those don't work for you
[30:00.460 --> 30:01.980]  or if they're not available,
[30:01.980 --> 30:04.280]  message me what is available in your area
[30:04.280 --> 30:05.620]  and I will talk to you personally
[30:05.620 --> 30:07.320]  and we'll see what we can dial in
[30:07.320 --> 30:08.500]  to get rid of the anxiety
[30:08.500 --> 30:09.960]  because anxiety is a bitch
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.740]  and nobody should ever have to live like that.
[30:12.740 --> 30:13.580]  All right, Senior Smith.
[30:13.580 --> 30:15.640]  Thanks again for the great email.
[30:15.640 --> 30:17.740]  I look forward to your response.
[30:17.740 --> 30:19.580]  Let me know if I helped you out at all.

[31:23.240 --> 31:24.080]  are all caught up,
[31:24.080 --> 31:26.080]  they're gonna start falling out of the feed as well.
