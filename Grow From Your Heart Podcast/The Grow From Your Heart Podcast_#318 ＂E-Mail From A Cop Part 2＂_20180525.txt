[00:00.640 --> 00:04.920]  What's up podcast world? It's time for episode 318 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.920 --> 00:08.720]  podcast. No music today, just a quick episode. Let's get right to it. This
[00:08.720 --> 00:12.040]  episode is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you
[00:12.040 --> 00:15.640]  need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:15.640 --> 00:21.360]  You can find them at dankseed.store. Also, this podcast is brought to you by
[00:21.360 --> 00:25.160]  my friends at PL Grow Systems. Are you the type of grower that wants to know
[00:25.160 --> 00:28.400]  what's going on in your garden while you're away? You can pay attention to
[00:28.400 --> 00:32.160]  what's happening at all times with your PL Grow Systems Minder Unit. To learn
[00:32.160 --> 00:37.080]  more about the Minder Unit, check out PL Grow Systems at PLGrow.Systems.
[00:37.080 --> 00:40.440]  Alright podcast world, I like to start the episodes off by letting you know
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.280]  what I'm dabbing on. Today I've been taking dabs of New York City Diesel
[00:44.280 --> 00:48.240]  Ambrosia Batter from our friends at Apothecary Extracts. I just cracked open
[00:48.240 --> 00:51.520]  the jar and I'm holding it kind of kind of low. It's on the table, it's not up by
[00:51.520 --> 00:56.300]  my face and I can just smell the diesel funk turps coming out of this. It is
[00:56.300 --> 01:01.140]  overwhelming. When you take a dab of this, it leaves this diesel-y layer of
[01:01.140 --> 01:05.180]  funky cottonmouth over your tongue that is just disgustingly delightful. I love
[01:05.180 --> 01:09.680]  it. It is so thick and so funky. It's got my mouth super dry, but I love it. It's a
[01:09.680 --> 01:14.220]  good thing. The high is intense. It comes on super quickly. It goes right to the
[01:14.220 --> 01:17.820]  face, right to the head, and something that I've noticed from smoking it all
[01:17.820 --> 01:22.340]  day, usually my eyes don't get very red when I smoke, but today my eyes are
[01:22.340 --> 01:27.060]  bloody dragon red from the New York City Diesel. So big shout out to my
[01:27.060 --> 01:30.660]  friends at Apothecary and Colorado Springs for the New York City Diesel
[01:30.660 --> 01:35.940]  Ambrosia Batter. This stuff is tremendous. You guys, my eyes are so red. I can feel
[01:35.940 --> 01:39.300]  it. Have you ever been able to feel how red your eyes are? I can feel it. I feel
[01:39.300 --> 01:43.780]  like they're bubbly and just just bloody red. Alright you guys, what do we want to
[01:43.780 --> 01:47.820]  talk about next? Let's talk about YouTube. I have got all of the videos up on
[01:47.820 --> 01:53.260]  YouTube. That's right. All 317 episodes are now up on YouTube, which means I'm
[01:53.260 --> 01:56.780]  one behind because this episode is out, but I'm going to try to get everything
[01:56.780 --> 02:00.660]  out within a week of posting a new episode. So when the episodes come out on
[02:00.660 --> 02:05.100]  iTunes and Stitcher, within a week I'll try to have it up on YouTube, which
[02:05.100 --> 02:08.140]  shouldn't be a challenge at all. I'm just saying a week to buy myself time. It
[02:08.140 --> 02:10.820]  takes me a little bit of time to make the video, and then loading the video
[02:10.820 --> 02:14.160]  takes several hours, and then YouTube has to process the video, and then it finally
[02:14.160 --> 02:18.220]  pops up. So I'm gonna try to stay less than a week behind on all of the YouTube
[02:18.220 --> 02:21.880]  videos. That means the people watching on YouTube are almost current. They're less
[02:21.880 --> 02:25.560]  than a week behind at all times. So all of the videos are on YouTube. If you want
[02:25.560 --> 02:28.440]  to watch on YouTube, just simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast and
[02:28.440 --> 02:33.560]  you will find the channel. On the last episode of the podcast, I read an email
[02:33.560 --> 02:37.520]  from a cop, and while I was reading his email, I actually asked him a few
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.480]  questions, and he was kind enough to reply already. So I've got a response
[02:41.480 --> 02:44.960]  from our friend the cop, and if you didn't listen, make sure you go back and
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.640]  listen to episode 317, where I read the email from a cop, and this is email from
[02:49.640 --> 02:52.520]  a cop part 2, and it goes like this.
[03:11.480 --> 03:18.480]  Hey, I like that approach. Sometimes you gotta pull people over and say, hey bro, we need you to slow down in this area because we got trucks coming on the highway or whatever, but just pull them over, explain why. Don't pull them over, give them a $150 ticket, and fuck up their whole month, and then you're done.
[03:42.480 --> 03:49.480]  And then they hate the cops. So I like your approach, man. Pull them over, explain why, don't give them a ticket, tell them, hey, be careful, have a great day, send them on their way.
[03:49.480 --> 03:55.480]  That's how I think policing should be done. That is proper, that's respectable, that's respectful. That's what we want.
[03:55.480 --> 03:57.480]  So the email goes on and it says,
[04:11.480 --> 04:23.480]  So that makes sense. You can't go talking about something that could get you fired and will cause turmoil within your job. So that makes sense.
[04:23.480 --> 04:31.480]  As long as your coworkers are seeing it and they're like, man, he's actually doing pretty well just using cannabis, and you're not too braggadocious about it and too open about it.
[04:31.480 --> 04:38.480]  I bet your close friends see it, and I bet they're telling their other friends, and I bet word's getting around and they know without you blasting it too much, without airing it out there too much.
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.480]  So that's cool. I hope they're learning, I hope they're accepting you, I hope nobody's targeting you.
[04:43.480 --> 04:46.480]  There's one more paragraph of the email and it goes like this,
[04:46.480 --> 04:55.480]  By the way, is any strain with black cherry in it meant it was originally from you? I'm really enjoying some black cherry cookies indica right now and it's super yummy.
[04:55.480 --> 05:03.480]  What he's referring to is my strain black cherry chem. I made a cross called black cherry chem several years ago, which is discontinued. It's no longer available.
[05:03.480 --> 05:09.480]  But no, if it says black cherry chem, that does not mean I made it. I got the black cherry clone. I didn't even use black cherry.
[05:09.480 --> 05:18.480]  Black cherry chem was a plush berry cross. The plush berry was very black cherry dominant, and it brought out the black cherry in the black cherry chem.
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.480]  So it got the name black cherry chem. I did not make the black cherry soda.
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.480]  That was from another breeder who I believe may be from Oregon, but I'm not sure.
[05:27.480 --> 05:34.480]  That is kind of an older strain and no, I did not breed or create the black cherry. Not everything with black cherry in it was going to be from me.
[05:34.480 --> 05:39.480]  So don't give me credit for all that black cherry stuff you guys. That was not all me. The black cherry chem is the only one I did.
[05:39.480 --> 05:46.480]  So he wraps up the email by saying, Have a good one. I'm always able and willing to answer questions should they come up. Peace.
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.480]  Hey, thanks again for the great email. Thanks again for the great information. Thanks again for the great interaction.
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.480]  And then I did respond with another question. I said, thanks again for the great emails. What state do you live in?
[05:57.480 --> 06:07.480]  If this guy is in Colorado and he's willing to be on the podcast, I'm going to ask him to be on the show and I will drive to wherever he is and we will record a nice podcast section with a cop.
[06:07.480 --> 06:13.480]  So if you guys have questions you want me to ask a cop, start sending them to me. You can email me. It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[06:13.480 --> 06:17.480]  I will start getting your questions prepared to ask a cop on the podcast.
[06:17.480 --> 06:21.480]  Also, hey, Mike, I might want you to come with me for this episode. This could be fun.
[06:21.480 --> 06:26.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to read a couple of more quick emails before we wrap up this Thursday episode.
[06:26.480 --> 06:33.480]  I have stacks and stacks of emails that I'd like to catch up on. This one is quick and it says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, still loving the podcast.
[06:33.480 --> 06:38.480]  Thank you for all of your time and effort that you take out of your schedule to produce and deliver great content.
[06:38.480 --> 06:40.480]  Hey, you're very welcome, man. Thank you for the great email.
[06:40.480 --> 06:46.480]  This email goes on to make a couple of offers to help me catch up on the YouTube channel and do a few technical things.
[06:46.480 --> 06:52.480]  But hey, man, I've got that taken care of. I bought a new MacBook. I made some changes and I've got it all solved.
[06:52.480 --> 06:57.480]  I do appreciate you reaching out and trying to help. Big shout out for that. Much appreciated.
[06:57.480 --> 07:04.480]  And, dude, thanks for the great email. If you've ever got any questions, please send me a question and I will answer it on the show for you.
[07:05.480 --> 07:12.480]  All right, I've got another quick email. This one says, Hey, Jeff, congratulations on the 300th episode. Nice milestone, brother.
[07:12.480 --> 07:18.480]  Then he says, Keep the train rolling. And then he asks a question about a previous conversation him and I had.
[07:18.480 --> 07:23.480]  I'm not sure how that was resolved. So send me another email and we will get back on that conversation.
[07:23.480 --> 07:28.480]  All right, I've got another email. This one came. I don't know if they want their name said or not.
[07:28.480 --> 07:31.480]  Yes, get roasted and toasted. 420 is this person's name.
[07:31.480 --> 07:35.480]  They said, I just started listening to your podcast. I've been growing for about a year now.
[07:35.480 --> 07:40.480]  I would like to know what you think about back building or bud pinching technique.
[07:40.480 --> 07:43.480]  The email goes on to say, plus, do you have a strain that's 20 to one CBD?
[07:43.480 --> 07:54.480]  I'm needing a strain for my wife who has lupus and cannot have high levels of THC due to being a patient of a pain clinic in my state that has not gotten there as far as legalization.
[07:54.480 --> 08:00.480]  Thank you. Get roasted and toasted. 420. Let's start from the top here. Get roasted.
[08:00.480 --> 08:04.480]  Back building and bud pinching. I had to Google that and figure out what that was.
[08:04.480 --> 08:07.480]  I had to ask this emailer what they meant by that.
[08:07.480 --> 08:15.480]  They said that back building is where you cut off the top of a bud to induce bud growth, something like one tenth of the bud size.
[08:15.480 --> 08:20.480]  And then he told me to Google it. And he said he just saw it come up in forms and on Google.
[08:20.480 --> 08:24.480]  I think I did this a long time ago to a plant on accident.
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.480]  I was moving a plant that had just started budding and the top of it got chopped off.
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.480]  And it made a pretty good sized top bud, but it never tightened up.
[08:32.480 --> 08:36.480]  The bottom of the plant made nice buds, but that top one just grew funky.
[08:36.480 --> 08:39.480]  I honestly don't have any experience in that.
[08:39.480 --> 08:45.480]  I don't think I would encourage cutting off buds during flowering.
[08:45.480 --> 08:50.480]  I could be totally wrong, but in my opinion, I feel like this would probably slow down your plants.
[08:50.480 --> 08:56.480]  It may make them explode. It may be very strain specific, but it's not something that I would recommend for a commercial setting.
[08:56.480 --> 09:02.480]  I think it would be time consuming and unless it's going to give me a whole bunch of more bud, I don't think it would be worth it.
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.480]  So no, I don't have any experience with back building or bud pinching.
[09:07.480 --> 09:10.480]  I don't know enough about it to say that I would recommend it.
[09:10.480 --> 09:13.480]  Honestly, it sounds like something that I would probably skip personally.
[09:13.480 --> 09:16.480]  Maybe experiment with it in your personal garden if you want to try it.
[09:16.480 --> 09:23.480]  Maybe pick one plant and back build it, bud pinch it, and then don't do that to the other plants and see if that one performs better.
[09:23.480 --> 09:30.480]  Maybe it's strain specific, but from my experience, when I accidentally did that, I did not like the outcome.
[09:30.480 --> 09:36.480]  If you're trying to grow things that you just want to make concentrates, maybe that would work for you because in my experience, it made a fluffier bud.
[09:36.480 --> 09:38.480]  It didn't tighten up like it should have.
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.480]  The rest of the buds tightened up. The rest of the plants of the same strain got tighter, more dense is what I mean.
[09:43.480 --> 09:48.480]  And that top bud where I kind of pinched it on accident, that one didn't tighten up like the rest.
[09:48.480 --> 09:51.480]  So that's my experience and I wouldn't do it again.
[09:51.480 --> 09:56.480]  So for the next part of your email, you asked if I have a strain that is 20 to 1 CBD to THC.
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.480]  No, unfortunately, I do not breed that direction.
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.480]  Most of what I breed is the exact opposite.
[10:01.480 --> 10:03.480]  I am breeding for high THC.
[10:03.480 --> 10:06.480]  I am not a fan of CBD. I apologize.
[10:06.480 --> 10:08.480]  That is just not what I am breeding for.
[10:08.480 --> 10:14.480]  I usually breed strains that work for my brain injury, strains that work for my body type, strains that work for me.
[10:14.480 --> 10:16.480]  I'm my guinea pig. I'm my tester.
[10:17.480 --> 10:21.480]  So I'm breeding high THC, high limonene, high terpeneline type strains.
[10:21.480 --> 10:24.480]  That's the stuff I'm going for. I do apologize.
[10:24.480 --> 10:27.480]  I don't have the 20 to 1 CBD strain that you're looking for.
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.480]  I do want you to find something that will help out your wife with her lupus.
[10:31.480 --> 10:35.480]  That sounds terrible. I would recommend Torabora from DNA Genetics.
[10:35.480 --> 10:38.480]  If you can find Torabora, that's a high CBD strain.
[10:38.480 --> 10:42.480]  It is reliable. It's been lab tested and it's a proven Cannabis Cup winner.
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.480]  Look for the Torabora from DNA Genetics and hopefully you can find some of that.
[10:47.480 --> 10:50.480]  I know that's a high CBD strain and it should certainly help.
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.480]  Hopefully alleviate some of the effects of the lupus there with your wife.
[10:54.480 --> 10:56.480]  Hey man, stay strong. Take good care of her.
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.480]  That's very admirable of you, trying to find strains specifically to take care of your wife.
[11:01.480 --> 11:02.480]  Much respect.
[11:02.480 --> 11:04.480]  Alright, Podcast World. That's enough emails for today.
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.480]  I just wanted to catch up a couple of those quick loose ends.
[11:07.480 --> 11:10.480]  I do have a ton more emails that I want to work my way through.
[11:10.480 --> 11:12.480]  I will start getting through the pile.
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.480]  Now that I've got the YouTube channel caught up, I've got a little bit more time.
[11:15.480 --> 11:17.480]  More areas to focus my energy.
[11:17.480 --> 11:20.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a couple of real quick shoutouts.
[11:20.480 --> 11:27.480]  I want to give a huge shoutout to Dustin Smith, Alfonso Johnson, Jake Jordan, and James Butterson.

[12:27.480 --> 12:29.480]  working hard to keep the bugs away,
[12:29.480 --> 12:31.480]  working hard to keep everything trellised up,
[12:31.480 --> 12:32.480]  keep all the funky leaves out of there,
[12:32.480 --> 12:33.480]  keep the floor swept and mopped,

[12:36.480 --> 12:38.480]  keep everything mellow for the neighbors,
[12:38.480 --> 12:39.480]  keep the smell down.
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.480]  You gotta balance out your life.

[12:42.480 --> 12:43.480]  You gotta balance out your girlfriend.
[12:43.480 --> 12:44.480]  You gotta spend time with the dog.
[12:44.480 --> 12:45.480]  You gotta go to work.
[12:45.480 --> 12:47.480]  You gotta get some time in on Fortnite.
[12:47.480 --> 12:48.480]  I get it. There's so much to do.
[12:48.480 --> 12:51.480]  But don't forget to stop and enjoy your garden.
[12:51.480 --> 12:54.480]  Don't work your ass off so hard that you don't love that garden anymore.
[12:54.480 --> 12:57.480]  Just stop, take a minute, and smell the flowers, you guys.
[12:57.480 --> 12:58.480]  That's what they're there for.
[12:58.480 --> 12:59.480]  You gotta love them.
[12:59.480 --> 13:01.480]  Love what you do.
[13:01.480 --> 13:02.480]  Do what you love.
[13:02.480 --> 13:04.480]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna wrap up this podcast.
[13:04.480 --> 13:06.480]  I'll be back Monday with the full-length episode.
[13:06.480 --> 13:08.480]  Thanks for hanging out for a quickie with me.
[13:08.480 --> 13:10.480]  I'm gonna give a huge shout-out to my friend Giddy Up!
[13:10.480 --> 13:13.480]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
