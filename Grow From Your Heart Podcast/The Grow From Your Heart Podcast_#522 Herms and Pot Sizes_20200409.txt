[00:00.000 --> 00:05.200]  All right, here we go. Welcome back, podcast world. It is time for episode 522 of the Grow
[00:05.200 --> 00:09.360]  From Your Heart podcast. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff. Thank you again for joining me.

[00:50.720 --> 00:55.520]  I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of
[00:55.520 --> 01:02.240]  Cowboy Kush full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of HA, OG, and Stardog.
[01:02.240 --> 01:06.720]  On the package, the flavor is described as earthy, fuel, and leather. We've spoken about
[01:06.720 --> 01:11.920]  this concentrate on the show before. I mostly agree with those flavors. I love the buzz from
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.400]  the Cowboy Kush. You can tell I'm trying to catch my breath. The dabs I took kind of took my breath
[01:16.400 --> 01:20.880]  away. It also made me nice and chilled out. I'm just chilling in the chair right now. My eyes are
[01:20.880 --> 01:26.080]  a little bit droopy. I've got terrible posture right now. I am fucking stoned. Some concentrates
[01:26.080 --> 01:31.600]  make you nice and high. This one makes me super stoned. On the back of the container, it says that
[01:31.600 --> 01:39.760]  this contains 64.88% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. I'm really enjoying the buzz,
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.720]  the flavor, the aroma, and this concentrate was beautiful. So big shout out to my friends
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.080]  at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and potent Cowboy Kush. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.320]  in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails. Before we get there,
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.440]  let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who help support the show on Patreon.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.880]  We are still in a quarantine lockdown environment, so all of these joints, all of these bong rips,
[02:04.880 --> 02:10.080]  all of these dabs are going to be digital and virtual, and we will follow safe social distancing
[02:10.080 --> 02:15.200]  guidelines. But let's get started by rolling up a big fat joint and passing that digital joint over
[02:15.200 --> 02:21.280]  to my friend Country Kush. Let's pack up a big giant digital bong load for my buddy Ryan M.
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.880]  I want to roll a big fat cyber joint for my buddy Adam Sloan. How about we pack up a big fresh bowl
[02:26.880 --> 02:33.280]  of JPEGs for my buddy Flava Maker. Let's send a big digital dab over to my buddy Carlos B.
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.200]  Why don't we pack up a big fresh bowl of MP3s and fire them up for my buddy Brandon. I know
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.200]  we're getting crazy now. I'm trying to have fun during a quarantine environment. Have fun with me,
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.960]  ladies and gentlemen. Let's keep the fun going by rolling up a big fat joint of JPEGs and MP3s.
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.120]  We'll put some GIFs on the outside of it, then we'll sprinkle some Keef down the middle of it
[02:53.120 --> 02:57.360]  just to get creative. We're going to fire that fucker up and pass it over to my buddy Aldridge.
[02:57.360 --> 03:04.320]  I've always got a giant digital dab for my buddy Sam. Let's roll up a big fat joint of MP3s,
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.560]  sprinkle a couple of GIF files on the outside of that, and then let's pass that fucker over to the
[03:08.560 --> 03:14.240]  hardest working man in cannabis. Let's send that over to my buddy James Brown. Then I want to take
[03:14.240 --> 03:20.240]  a big fat bong rip of digital downloads and send that fucker over to my buddy Godfather Kush.
[03:20.240 --> 03:25.520]  Then last but certainly not least, how about a big digital hug, a high five, and a giant,
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.960]  giant dab from my buddy Woodside195. Big thanks, big shout out, big digital dabs,
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.600]  big hypothetical social distance hugs to all of my friends and family who continue to support the
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.080]  show on Patreon. I really do appreciate the support. If you're not supporting the show and
[03:42.080 --> 03:48.800]  you would like to learn how to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow
[03:48.800 --> 03:53.200]  from your heart. All of the information you need is on the screen. And of course, I did include a
[03:53.200 --> 03:59.200]  link in the show notes and in the video description for my stoned friends. All right, ladies and
[03:59.200 --> 04:03.360]  gentlemen, before we get to the email portion of the show, I've got one more thing I'd like to say.
[04:03.360 --> 04:09.760]  I want to give a giant congratulations to all of my friends at the Dude Grows show. The Dude Grows
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.440]  show recently hit their 1000th podcast episode. I'm honored to have been on the show. I'm honored
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.160]  to be friends with the whole Dude Grows crew. I'm honored to be part of the Dude Grows crew,
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.120]  the Dude Grows gang, the Dude Grows army, the Iry Army, the Grow From Your Heart podcast crew,
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.080]  and the Dude Grows crew is all one gang in my mind. And it's an honor to be a part of that club,
[04:30.080 --> 04:34.720]  a part of that gang. So big shout out to all of my friends in the Dude Grows crew and big
[04:34.720 --> 04:41.520]  congratulations, big high five, big dabs, big joints to my friends at the Dude Grows show for
[04:41.520 --> 04:47.840]  the 1000th episode milestone. I'm sure it means a lot when all of the Dude Grows crew says congrats
[04:47.840 --> 04:53.360]  on 1000, but I'm a podcaster. I'm a fellow podcaster. I know what it's like to get guests
[04:53.360 --> 04:58.640]  together. I know what it's like just trying to get a co-host together. The Dude Grows crew does a very
[04:58.640 --> 05:03.520]  professionally done show. It's very high quality. It's very informative. They've got three dudes on
[05:03.520 --> 05:07.200]  the show that are there most of the time, at least two of the three show up together.
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.480]  It is very hard to get that many stoners, that many people with jobs and lives in a room together.
[05:12.480 --> 05:16.880]  They've done it a thousand times. So big shout out to my friends from one podcaster to another.
[05:16.880 --> 05:22.160]  I see it. I appreciate it. I respect it. Good work, you guys. I can't wait to get to a thousand.
[05:22.160 --> 05:28.480]  I think by the time I do that, they will probably be around 2000, at least 1500 episodes in. So big
[05:28.480 --> 05:33.920]  shout out to my boys. Keep it going, you guys. The Dude, Scotty, Guru, everybody behind the scenes.
[05:33.920 --> 05:38.720]  Keep it going. Keep it going. I love the show. And I'll be back up in Fort Collins to be on the show
[05:38.720 --> 05:44.000]  as soon as this quarantine stuff has ended. You guys, I'll get myself up there. It's only a four
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.560]  hour drive. It's worth it. I'll go up and see the crew. Scotty, the Dude, Guru, I look forward to
[05:48.560 --> 05:52.960]  hanging out. All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the point of the show where we are going to read
[05:52.960 --> 05:57.920]  listener generated content. That's right. If you've got a cannabis culture, a cannabis cultivation
[05:57.920 --> 06:02.960]  question, I would love to hear from you. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:02.960 --> 06:07.280]  Send me an email. I will get your question on the show. Some people have messaged me and they said,
[06:07.280 --> 06:12.480]  Dude, I've emailed you a couple of times. Why hasn't my email been read? You would be amazed
[06:12.480 --> 06:19.120]  and or overwhelmed at the amount of emails I get every single day for the podcast. Please be
[06:19.120 --> 06:23.440]  patient. Please bear with me. I know that some of your questions are very urgent and very important,
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.760]  but I'm trying to get to all of them in a timely manner. And I'm trying to give each message
[06:27.760 --> 06:32.640]  the time and energy and respect which it deserves. You guys rely on me. So instead of just
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.760]  breezing through them, I try to give a good answer for each one. So it takes me a minute, but I will
[06:37.760 --> 06:42.960]  get to the messages. I'm going to focus on a lot of emails for the next few shows. So let's get
[06:42.960 --> 06:49.600]  right to it. The first email on the pile of emails in today's episode goes just like this. It says,
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.160]  what's up Rasta Jeff. First off, I want to thank you for all of the time and effort you put into
[06:54.160 --> 06:59.120]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Between the Dude Grows show and your podcast, I've been gifted
[06:59.120 --> 07:05.040]  a tremendous amount of education and I thank you for that. Hey, you are very welcome. The Dude
[07:05.040 --> 07:10.000]  Grows crew and myself, we are honored and we are excited to teach you. And it's great to hear that
[07:10.960 --> 07:15.280]  you've been gifted a tremendous amount of education. I'm glad somebody realizes that.
[07:15.280 --> 07:19.600]  Thank you for mentioning it. And I appreciate hearing it. Let's keep going. It says,
[07:19.600 --> 07:24.720]  I have some iReed Genetics Golden Goat coming in the mail any day now, and I couldn't be more
[07:24.720 --> 07:29.760]  excited to run your line. One of my favorite strains and I've never been able to grow it
[07:29.760 --> 07:34.320]  before. I'm excited for you to get that Golden Goat. I got this message quite a while ago,
[07:34.320 --> 07:38.800]  so you've probably got those seeds now. I hope you are crushing it. Kick ass with the Golden
[07:38.800 --> 07:43.360]  Goat. If you've got questions, let me know. Of course, there is a Golden Goat podcast episode.
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.120]  Be sure to enjoy that. The message says, anyway, my mind is adrift. That sounds like a fish lyric.
[07:49.120 --> 07:55.520]  It says, here we go. The question, I grew Holy Grail Kush feminized seeds, which hermed on me,
[07:55.520 --> 08:01.920]  in turn, which pollinated our neighbor Pineapple Chunk, which was also a feminized seed. So they've
[08:01.920 --> 08:07.600]  got a grow room. They had Holy Grail Kush feminized seeds. They also had Pineapple Chunk feminized
[08:07.600 --> 08:13.680]  seeds in this room. The Holy Grail Kush in this room is suspected of showing intersex traits or
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.720]  becoming a hermaphrodite and pollinating the rest of the room. So I'm going to assume you have got
[08:18.720 --> 08:24.880]  a room filled with seeds. Now it says, question number one, will some of the seeds be feminized?
[08:24.880 --> 08:30.640]  I'm guessing no on this one. You are probably correct, but I cannot tell you for sure until
[08:30.640 --> 08:37.520]  you grow them. Since the pollen donor was a hermaphroditic plant, that trait is going to be
[08:37.520 --> 08:44.320]  at least 50% existent in your future plants. Those seeds carry a hermaphroditic trait. So there's a
[08:44.320 --> 08:49.680]  good chance they will be herms. There is also a good chance they will be fems, but it is more
[08:49.680 --> 08:54.720]  likely you've got hermaphrodites. If you grow them out and you see any male flowers come out of them,
[08:54.720 --> 09:00.880]  it's very likely you've got hermaphroditic seeds. The second question is, so I've made an accidental
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.920]  cross, I think, but will it be worth growing out the seeds? Either the seeds from the Holy Grail,
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.080]  which was so loaded with seeds, I just made it into edibles, or grow out the Pineapple Chunk
[09:10.080 --> 09:15.040]  Seeds crossed to the Holy Grail. I'm not sure this is even considered a cross. It's not really
[09:15.040 --> 09:19.840]  a cross. It's more like an accidental pollination. It's nothing you would want to give away or share
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.360]  with anybody until you grow out probably a hundred of those seeds each. Each one. You have to grow
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.000]  the Holy Grail, Holy Grail Kush, and you have to grow the Holy Grail Pineapple Chunk Seeds. You
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.320]  have to grow all of them and see what you've got. Grow them like you would any other plants,
[09:34.320 --> 09:39.120]  but pay very close attention to them. Veg them. Take good notes on them. Flower them. Take good
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.320]  notes on the flowering cycle. Pay very close attention. If you see any intersex traits or
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.600]  any problems, get rid of them. You could have made gold. You could have also made a bunch of
[09:49.600 --> 09:54.400]  bullshit. Like I said earlier, since one of the parents was a hermaphrodite, the future progeny
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.680]  is probably a hermaphrodite. You may, however, find a couple of real gems in there. If you don't
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.080]  intend on selling them, if you don't intend on profiting from them, you have some fun seeds to
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.480]  play with. Grow a few. See if they're worth a shit. If the first few don't impress you,
[10:08.480 --> 10:13.520]  you can abandon the project. There's no reason to keep it going, but do not spread those shitty
[10:13.520 --> 10:19.840]  seeds to other people. The responsibility as a cannabis breeder is to improve the lines that we
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.000]  are working with, not to make it shittier. We want to say, oh, I got these two plants,
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  and I'm going to put them together, and the outcome will be better. If you make it shittier,
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.840]  you're moving backwards. You're time traveling backwards. You're making the whole race of
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.120]  cannabis, you're making it dumber. So we need to make it better. We need to move forward.
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.280]  That is your goal. So if you've got room, time, and space, grow a few of them out. See if they're
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.680]  worth a shit. If not, throw them away. Feed them to the birds. Put them in the compost bin. There
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.040]  are several options that you could do with them. You can eat them if you're comfortable with it.
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.560]  They're good hemp seeds or something. I don't know. Get creative. There is more to this message,
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.720]  though. It says, I'm going to grow them out for fun either way. Yes, that is what you should do.
[10:54.720 --> 10:58.480]  I've grown these strains without ever having a problem before, but I was wondering, genetically,
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.160]  are they just going to herm again, or at least very likely? That's a good question. What happened
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.000]  in that grow room this time that was different? Did you have a light leak? Did you overwater? Did
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.680]  you overfeed? Did you underwater? Did you stress these plants out in multiple ways? What went wrong?
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.240]  Now that you know you've got a problem, you need to investigate and diagnose that problem
[11:18.240 --> 11:21.840]  and figure out what caused that plant to hermaphrodite. Was it one in the corner
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.960]  that's near a light leak? Was it one by a vent that's getting a little bit light,
[11:24.960 --> 11:29.040]  coming in from one of the vents or the ducts or something? You've got to figure out why that plant
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.880]  hermed. We know that it's got that trait. We know that it's in the genetic code. We just know that
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.160]  something unlocked it, and we don't know what that was. As long as it was not unlocked again
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.800]  by a light leak or something, you can grow that plant. But I would only do it one more time if it
[11:44.800 --> 11:49.280]  herms again. If it fucks up next time, get rid of it. Give it one more chance. See what it does.
[11:49.280 --> 11:55.360]  If it gives you shit, it's got to go. A lot of Cush genetics are prone to being hermaphroditic.
[11:55.360 --> 12:00.240]  That is something that is known in the old school growing community. Some Cush stuff is a pain in
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.720]  the ass. So it may be just a really sensitive plant. You could have done something. I'm not
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.280]  blaming you, but you could have done something very easily with the feed, with the nutrients,
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.280]  with the spray, just being in there. You could have pissed that plant off and just triggered
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.760]  that plant to show its intersex traits. There is more to this message. I want to keep going. It
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.080]  says, I've been growing it consistently for three years. I have everything dialed in, which includes
[12:22.080 --> 12:28.400]  these strains. So I think the herm was just a fluke. Something caused it. The fluke herm out of
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.800]  three years is not a thing that something caused that. It's not just happening. There is a cause.
[12:34.800 --> 12:39.600]  That is a reaction to a cause. It says, thank you again for all that you do. I hope to see you
[12:39.600 --> 12:46.640]  around our beautiful state. I will for sure say hello if I do with love from Red Heights. Hey,
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.720]  Red Heights, it sounds like you're a Colorado person. I hope we get to bump into each other
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.560]  as soon as this quarantine situation is done. We can smoke a joint more than digitally at that time.
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.720]  Hey, big shout out to my friend, Red Heights. I appreciate the great message. I hope you figure
[13:00.720 --> 13:05.680]  out what is causing that holy grail cush to go herm on you, because that is a great cross from
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.920]  some great breeders. Big shout out, big thanks. You guys, I'm going to take a quick drink,
[13:09.920 --> 13:13.440]  and then we're going to move right into the next email. Most of the time I would pause for a drink.
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.120]  We're just going to keep going. You get to hear it happen right now. Here it is. Hydrate with me,
[13:17.120 --> 13:24.760]  boys and girls. All right, there we go. Nice and hydrated. Let's keep this show moving. I do have
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.280]  another email right here in front of me. This one comes from, oh, I don't think they want their name.
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.520]  It says deep in prohibition land. So let's not even say their name. They will know who they are.
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.240]  The message goes just like this. Yo, Jeff, I hope you are doing well, sir. I am great so far. Thank
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.720]  you for checking in on me. I have not contributed to the podcast yet, but I plan on it. Hey,
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.360]  that's all right, man. I don't expect everybody to contribute to Patreon. I know I mention and
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.000]  talk about the Patreon quite often, at least once, maybe twice every episode, but I still love you.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.080]  I still want you to be my friend, and I still want you to listen even if you cannot contribute.
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.800]  The show is free. It's free for everybody. Some people are able to help. They will help out for
[14:03.800 --> 14:09.240]  everybody. If you cannot, keep listening. All you have to do is be the best grower that you can be.
[14:09.240 --> 14:13.080]  That's all I ask of you. Think about that every time you walk into the grow room. Think about
[14:13.080 --> 14:16.760]  that whenever you walk out of the grow room. Think about that when you're sharing grow knowledge and
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.400]  grow advice. Be the best grower you can be. Never give bad advice. Never give untested,
[14:21.400 --> 14:25.800]  unsound advice. Never do stupid shit in your garden. Never be lazy. Always have a good
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.600]  attitude when you're in the grow. Never go in your garden thinking about, this is going to
[14:30.600 --> 14:35.240]  yield two pounds, and I'm going to make this much money. Fuck that. Never think about your wallet
[14:35.240 --> 14:38.760]  when you're in the grow room. If you're having a hard time with somebody, maybe if you're fighting
[14:38.760 --> 14:41.960]  with somebody at work, maybe your boss yelled at you, maybe you're having a hard time with your
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.960]  girlfriend, maybe you had to discipline your kids and you got some weird weight on your shoulders or
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.640]  a weird feeling in your heart, don't take that into the grow room with you. Leave that right
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.960]  outside the grow room door. Go in the grow room and let that be your place of bliss. Share that
[14:53.960 --> 14:58.600]  with the plants. That is a really important thing to think about. Do that for me, and you don't have
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.080]  to contribute to the podcast. That is free. Keep a good positive attitude in the grow room. Keep a
[15:03.080 --> 15:07.480]  good positive attitude fucking everywhere, but let it start right there in the grow. Let it grow right
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.800]  along with your plants, then walk out of there, carry that cool vibe with you all day. Be like
[15:11.800 --> 15:16.440]  that. It's much easier. Anyway, it's all free also. Have a good attitude. It doesn't fucking cost
[15:16.440 --> 15:20.520]  anything, and it's very rewarding. Let's stay focused because I'm getting rambly. It says,
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.960]  I did however order three packs of Iri genetic seeds recently, which includes orange gasm,
[15:25.960 --> 15:30.600]  Raphael, and Michelangelo. You've got a great mix that is going to be very flavorful.
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.920]  It says, I'm growing in a three by three tent. Sounds good so far with the timber grow light.
[15:34.920 --> 15:41.560]  Not familiar, but I can read about it. With four Vero 29S and my first grow tent, well with two
[15:41.560 --> 15:46.760]  regular plants. All right, so he's got a three by three tent, a couple of fancy lights, or four
[15:46.760 --> 15:51.640]  of one kind of light and one fancy light in there. It's the first tent with two regular plants.
[15:52.600 --> 15:56.360]  He says, I will be using radical bags, which is cool. I know a lot of folks that support the
[15:56.360 --> 16:01.560]  radical bags, and the five gallon side with ocean forest and nectar of the gods nutrients and
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.840]  supplements. I use bamboo sticks in my first grow, which worked well, and I may try a scrog
[16:06.840 --> 16:12.600]  moving forward. If you plan on moving the plants around, use the sticks. If you can live with having
[16:12.600 --> 16:17.320]  the plants stuck in place, if you can get around that three by three tent to water very well,
[16:17.320 --> 16:23.240]  if you can reach every pot, I recommend a scrog. The scrog will be much easier, much more uniform,
[16:23.240 --> 16:27.560]  and much safer. And in the three by three, all you have to do is strap it up to the corners in the
[16:27.560 --> 16:33.320]  tent. And when it comes to be watering, feeding, defoliating, working time, you can almost unwrap
[16:33.320 --> 16:37.640]  all of the tent around it. Most of the good tents are made where they really unzip really far. And
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.000]  you've got access to most, probably three of the four sides of that grow, probably one side's up
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.720]  against the wall anyway. So you can usually access three full sides in the tents if you do it right.
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.960]  I would recommend the trellis. Those sticks are great, but they get dangerous. You'll poke
[16:51.960 --> 16:56.440]  yourself in the eye with them. Also, they get dirty. Break one of those bamboo sticks open
[16:56.440 --> 17:00.600]  one time and see how much mold and see how much shit is inside of there. You'll be grossed out.
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.320]  It's kind of gross. If you're going to use sticks, I recommend you throw them away after every grow
[17:05.320 --> 17:10.600]  or use the plastic coated metal type garden sticks. They're a little more expensive,
[17:10.600 --> 17:14.840]  but they are safer. You can clean them. They're more reliable. They last longer.
[17:14.840 --> 17:18.600]  It's an investment up front, but you don't have to throw them away and they don't cause problems
[17:18.600 --> 17:23.320]  in the end. All right. I should keep myself on track here. Where are we? I am at this part,
[17:23.320 --> 17:27.320]  using bamboo sticks in my first grow. I have a question about the number of plants I should try
[17:27.320 --> 17:32.200]  to grow in a three by three, as I know your plants will grow with hyper vigor. And I'm curious if I
[17:32.200 --> 17:37.240]  should start growing one plant and give her some room or go for two and have them bump elbows.
[17:37.240 --> 17:42.040]  So to speak, the only issues I had with my first grow was heat, but I did go with the Gorilla Grow
[17:42.040 --> 17:47.720]  Tent this time and I have a nine foot ceiling. So I think things will be slightly cooler. And I do
[17:47.720 --> 17:52.520]  have a carbon filter with a six inch infinity fan. All right. You've got a lot of cool things
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.600]  to think about. Keep in mind that even if you've got a carbon filter in the fan, wherever you're
[17:56.600 --> 18:01.080]  dumping that heat, if it's going right into the same bedroom, it will end up back into the tent.
[18:01.080 --> 18:06.200]  I've done a recent episode on grow tent setup. I recommend you check that one out also. Hopefully
[18:06.200 --> 18:11.480]  you've already heard it. Now, the main question here is how many five gallon pots should I run
[18:11.480 --> 18:17.000]  in a three by three tent? You have got a couple of options and a couple of things to think about.
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.920]  If you were going to scrog it, I recommend somewhere between two and maybe four five
[18:22.920 --> 18:29.080]  gallon pots in that small space. And I would use a scrog net really close to the plants to spread
[18:29.080 --> 18:33.640]  them out really wide. Don't let them grow straight up, get them really wide. Once they're nice and
[18:33.640 --> 18:38.680]  spread out, I would put another net above them and let them grow into that net. Then I would work
[18:38.680 --> 18:45.240]  that net to fill the entire canopy. Once the entire canopy was filled with a nice, nice bushy hedge of
[18:45.240 --> 18:49.720]  branches and tops, that's when I would put a third net above that and flip into flower and
[18:49.720 --> 18:54.760]  let them grow into that third net. So you would have three layers of net. You would have a spreader,
[18:54.760 --> 19:00.120]  then you would have a scrog stretcher, then you would have the support net. I would do somewhere
[19:00.120 --> 19:06.600]  between two and four five gallon pots. Now let's go deeper into some of those options. If you do
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.680]  one, it is going to take quite some time to veg that one plant out long enough to fill that space.
[19:12.680 --> 19:18.200]  It's going to take quite a while. If you do two, you start filling the space more quickly. You
[19:18.200 --> 19:22.840]  don't have to wait as long. You're going to fill the space twice as fast. If you do three, obviously
[19:22.840 --> 19:28.200]  you're reducing veg time. If you do four, obviously you've cut down veg time tremendously. We can fill
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.920]  this space much more quickly with more plants. Now there are things to consider when it comes
[19:32.920 --> 19:37.080]  to these plant numbers. How many plants are you allowed to have? If you can only have two,
[19:37.080 --> 19:43.000]  stay legal. Grow two, wink wink. Now when we start watering these five gallon pots,
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.080]  we are introducing a lot of water into a three by three room. You're running five gallon radical
[19:49.080 --> 19:56.520]  bags. How many gallons of water does it take to fully saturate a five gallon radical bag? I'm
[19:56.520 --> 20:03.160]  going to guess you can pour a solid gallon, maybe two gallons of water into that radical bag every
[20:03.160 --> 20:09.160]  two to three days. Now if you've got four of those in that room, that is going to be approximately
[20:09.160 --> 20:14.840]  eight gallons of water poured into your radical bags in a three by three grow tent every two to
[20:14.840 --> 20:20.680]  three days. That is going to create a tremendous amount of humidity. First, you've got the water
[20:20.680 --> 20:24.680]  you've already poured into the pots. The light in the room is going to heat up the room. That is
[20:24.680 --> 20:29.400]  going to create evaporation from the water that is already in the pots. Then the plants are going
[20:29.400 --> 20:33.720]  to be letting out water already on their own. That is going to create more humidity in the
[20:33.720 --> 20:38.600]  environment. You are going to have to vent that room and pay very close attention to your VPD.
[20:38.600 --> 20:43.400]  You will have to defoliate heavily to slow down that release of water and also to prevent any
[20:43.400 --> 20:47.800]  kind of bud rot or powdery mildew. You're going to have a lot of moisture in the air and that causes
[20:47.800 --> 20:53.240]  a lot of problems. So if you can get the air out of that room, I would do four pots. If you can't
[20:53.240 --> 20:58.520]  control the air and the moisture, maybe reduce it to three. If you can be patient and let it veg
[20:58.760 --> 21:03.080]  slowly, go for two. If you're really worried about moisture, which you shouldn't be, I'm making you
[21:03.080 --> 21:07.320]  paranoid, one or two plants will be fine. Three will be kind of pushing it. Four, you're going to
[21:07.320 --> 21:11.880]  have to pay attention. If you can get that air out of the bedroom or whatever room you've got your
[21:11.880 --> 21:16.760]  tent in, you'll be okay. But keep in mind, if you're just ducting the air out of the tent into
[21:16.760 --> 21:21.320]  a spare bedroom, it is going to go right back into the grow tent. You've got to adjust that climate
[21:21.320 --> 21:26.520]  somehow with equipment or cycle it through another room. Let that air blend with room from another
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.760]  bedroom, from the main part of the house, from the central air. You've got to get that humidity,
[21:30.760 --> 21:36.520]  that old stagnant air balanced out. Also, we need air exchange to get fresh CO2 to the environment.
[21:36.520 --> 21:41.080]  But again, I would recommend one plant if you want to be really patient, two plants if you want to
[21:41.080 --> 21:45.800]  fill that scrog up, three plants if you want to go at it, and four plants if you really want to
[21:45.800 --> 21:49.880]  fucking kill it. Maybe if you can fit them in there and you haven't already bought the pots,
[21:49.880 --> 21:54.600]  maybe consider two seven-gallon pots. But again, we're going to have a lot of water and a lot of
[21:54.600 --> 21:59.720]  moisture in there. Part of my thought process almost recommended reducing the pot size so that
[21:59.720 --> 22:05.160]  we can get a faster wet and dry time. But I still think we're going to be pouring a lot of water
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.560]  into that room just more frequently. But it is something you can consider if you have smaller
[22:09.560 --> 22:14.840]  pots that is less water, but you're going to have to water every day or every other day. There are
[22:14.840 --> 22:20.120]  pros and cons to the bigger pots and the smaller pots. You guys know that I like to water every
[22:20.120 --> 22:24.840]  other day because I like a custom tailored nutrient mix. I also like to add boosts and do
[22:24.840 --> 22:29.320]  different things every other day. That gives me a lot of control. Bigger pots, you only get to
[22:29.320 --> 22:34.440]  water them once or twice a week. So you can only adjust your feed that often. If you see a problem,
[22:34.440 --> 22:38.680]  you want to make a change, you've got to wait. If you watered Monday, you've probably got to wait
[22:38.680 --> 22:42.680]  until Thursday to make a change. And if that change doesn't work, you're probably waiting
[22:42.680 --> 22:47.800]  until Monday for your next water. When I'm running smaller pots of cocoa, I get to water every other
[22:47.800 --> 22:52.280]  day. If I say, oh, I should increase nitrogen, that means tomorrow I get to increase the nitrogen.
[22:52.280 --> 22:56.200]  I don't have to wait until Thursday. That's just something I like, something to think about,
[22:56.200 --> 23:01.960]  something to consider. Don't let me derail your entire project with crazy ideas and crazy grower
[23:01.960 --> 23:07.560]  talk. I like your plan. Your strategy is going to work. So I would probably do two or three
[23:07.560 --> 23:13.000]  five-gallon pots or two seven-gallon pots if they would fit in the room. If you want a lot of work
[23:13.080 --> 23:17.800]  and you want to kind of struggle and make it a challenge, do four, five-gallon pots. It'll keep
[23:17.800 --> 23:22.680]  you on your toes. All right. There is more to this message. It says, I just wanted to pick your brain.
[23:22.680 --> 23:27.240]  Also, the Nectar of the Gods line does have a six-bottle sample pack they send out for free.
[23:27.240 --> 23:32.600]  Oh, and he offered me a pack. I don't have room to test a sample pack right now, but maybe in the
[23:32.600 --> 23:38.120]  future. I do appreciate that. I am stocked up on VegBloom and NuMill, and I've got a nice system,
[23:38.120 --> 23:42.680]  and I'm afraid to change it, honestly. But it says, I've listened to probably 100 plus of your
[23:42.680 --> 23:47.320]  podcasts as well as the DGC podcast, and I love them both. Hey, man, thank you for listening.
[23:47.320 --> 23:52.120]  Thanks for the support. Once again, big shout out to my friends at the DGC. Also, a big shout out to
[23:52.120 --> 23:57.000]  my friend. I don't know if they want their name said. It says, from this person, Deep in Prohibition
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.840]  Land. So we'll just call you Deep right now. Shout out to my friend Deep. And it says, by the way,
[24:00.840 --> 24:04.680]  I don't think I can make it to the DGC Cup this year, but I hope to meet you somewhere down the
[24:04.680 --> 24:09.000]  road. Glad you have found success in what you love. Hey, I look forward to meeting you. We've
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.040]  got a whole new opportunity of meeting because the DGC Cup has been delayed. It has been postponed
[24:14.040 --> 24:18.440]  because of this COVID-19 bullshit that we are experiencing, but we are going to put it together
[24:18.440 --> 24:22.760]  and make it happen as soon as we are able to congregate and have fun and smoke without worry
[24:22.760 --> 24:28.120]  of getting each other sick. And hey, it means a lot to me that you notice that I have found success
[24:28.120 --> 24:33.880]  in what I love. I do love what I'm doing. I love having a podcast. I love being a seed breeder.
[24:33.880 --> 24:38.920]  I love the life that I've built for myself. So thank you for noticing, and thank you for being
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.040]  excited that I have found the success. All right. If anybody else out there has any cannabis culture
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.520]  or cultivation questions, again, I would love to hear from you. My email address is growfromyourheart
[24:48.520 --> 24:55.320]  at hotmail.com. Send me an email. I'll do my best to get that on the show as soon as possible.
[24:55.320 --> 25:00.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks, I am going to be doing the 420 episode. Yes,
[25:00.440 --> 25:05.320]  420 is slowly creeping up on us. It does not feel like it because of this social distancing,
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.360]  because of this virus lockdown and quarantine situation. So I've got a question for you.
[25:10.360 --> 25:15.880]  How are you going to celebrate 420 this year with the quarantine situation, with the lockdown
[25:15.880 --> 25:19.720]  environment? If you're going to send me a message that says you're going to ignore the rules and
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.040]  smoke down and just have a party anyway, don't bother messaging me because I'm not going to have
[25:24.040 --> 25:30.840]  a positive response for you. Please practice safe social distancing guidelines at this time.
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.400]  I don't like rules. I don't like restrictions. I also don't like getting sick and watching people
[25:35.400 --> 25:40.680]  around me die. It is our responsibility right now to take care of ourselves and everyone else
[25:40.680 --> 25:46.280]  around us. Be courteous, be polite, be thoughtful, be mindful, protect yourself, protect everyone at
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.920]  this time. That's enough of a rant about the COVID-19 shit. What I want to know is what are
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.760]  you going to do to celebrate 420? Most of the time, we gather at some event, we gather in a park.
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.720]  I like to go to a show of some sort, be around other cannabis consumers, like-minded folks,
[26:01.720 --> 26:07.240]  get stoned, do the chatter thing, be social. We can't do that this year. What are you going to do?
[26:07.240 --> 26:10.920]  Are you going to do something online? Are you going to skip it altogether? Are you just going
[26:10.920 --> 26:16.360]  to hang out by yourself? What is your special 420 plan? Let me know. Send me an email. My email
[26:16.360 --> 26:21.720]  address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I'd love to know what you're doing for 420,
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.800]  and it better be social distance approved, or I may have a negative response. You've been warned.
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for this episode. I want to thank you
[26:31.320 --> 26:36.040]  for listening. If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining,

[27:11.000 --> 27:14.840]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content. I want to give a giant shout out to my
[27:14.840 --> 27:19.320]  friend Gilberto. Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[27:55.970 --> 27:58.210]  We need a lot of that in the community.
[28:01.490 --> 28:04.210]  Every day, fire in the community.
[28:15.330 --> 28:16.290]  The community.
[28:25.410 --> 28:26.850]  Only make the people dig.
[28:40.290 --> 28:43.010]  They use some terms of violence. That's the cause of it.
[28:55.170 --> 28:56.530]  We pick up the aliens.
[29:07.490 --> 29:08.370]  Black people.
[29:13.410 --> 29:14.770]  We come from Africa.
[29:19.330 --> 29:20.130]  The music is
[29:25.490 --> 29:25.970]  music.
[29:43.570 --> 29:47.810]  Tell it to the leaders, police and soldiers. Tell it to the youngsters.
[29:48.370 --> 29:50.530]  Tell them what I got.
[29:55.570 --> 29:56.850]  Take me to Africa.
[30:07.570 --> 30:08.210]  Music is
[30:13.650 --> 30:13.970]  music.
[30:18.770 --> 30:19.730]  Wow.
[30:19.730 --> 30:21.730]  Show more love to the youth.
[30:21.730 --> 30:23.730]  Create more jobs and build up more schools.
[30:23.730 --> 30:25.730]  Golden rules.
[30:25.730 --> 30:27.730]  Show more love to the youth.
[30:27.730 --> 30:29.730]  Create more jobs and build up more schools.
[30:29.730 --> 30:31.730]  Africa no. Music is only a diamond.
[30:31.730 --> 30:33.730]  Because there's not enough employment.
[30:33.730 --> 30:35.730]  The music is only a diamond.
