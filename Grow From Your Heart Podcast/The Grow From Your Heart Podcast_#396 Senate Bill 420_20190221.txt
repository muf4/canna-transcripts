[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  It's kind of hard to focus with Chris Farley flipping up his shades and just
[00:04.760 --> 00:06.560]  staring at me over and over again. Isn't it?
[00:06.600 --> 00:10.960]  I have forgotten how much I miss that man. Uh, the Adam Sandler,
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.240]  that's where I was headed. Yeah, that was amazing.
[00:13.840 --> 00:15.560]  That dredged up a lot of fields.
[00:15.560 --> 00:19.680]  I didn't know I still had and I forgot how much I miss him. This is comedy.
[00:20.480 --> 00:23.120]  So people are probably wondering why we're starting the podcast like this.
[00:23.120 --> 00:26.480]  I've just got the iPad sitting on the table. It's a random gift comment. Uh,
[00:26.500 --> 00:28.440]  yeah, I was going to read a comment that's right above this.
[00:28.440 --> 00:31.440]  And Chris Farley is here just flipping up his shades,
[00:31.520 --> 00:34.320]  popping the shades, just looking at us with that face.
[00:34.760 --> 00:37.680]  I imagine he sees booty with that face. He's making, he sees booty.
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.240]  He's looking up, lifting up them shades. Like, dang, look at that booty.
[00:40.320 --> 00:43.360]  That's the, that's not this kind of beach, but I appreciate it. Face.
[00:44.280 --> 00:46.880]  I see it like a car watch happened. And you know,
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.760]  we could probably press pause and we could probably see in the reflection of
[00:49.760 --> 00:53.120]  those cool sunglasses, what he's actually looking at.
[00:54.560 --> 00:55.400]  I like the dream.
[00:56.000 --> 00:57.280]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:57.280 --> 01:00.600]  It is time for episode three 96 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:00.600 --> 01:04.080]  Sitting across the table from me is one of my best friends. White Mike is here.
[01:04.080 --> 01:04.920]  Thanks for joining me, bro.
[01:04.960 --> 01:06.440]  Yeah, man. What's up everybody.
[01:06.880 --> 01:08.720]  Thanks for coming out, dude. It's cold out there. I'm glad you made it.
[01:08.720 --> 01:10.160]  She was just brutal cold in Colorado.
[01:10.200 --> 01:13.200]  When you hold and dry cold and dry is exactly it. I'm,
[01:13.200 --> 01:15.840]  I'm my lips feel to dry just from being out there for a little bit.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.560]  When you came in, I felt a, like a Popsicle trail, just follow you.
[01:19.760 --> 01:21.720]  Like it felt like the grim Reaper was walking behind you.
[01:21.720 --> 01:24.400]  You just brought in a trail of cold. Uh, when he took off your jacket,
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.240]  cold came off of your jacket. I was like, damn son, it is nasty cold out there.
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.280]  Yeah. Like nice today though. It's Southern Colorado living.
[01:33.360 --> 01:35.320]  We're used to it. It could be 70 tomorrow.
[01:35.360 --> 01:38.600]  Who knows what we've got going on lately. Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:38.640 --> 01:41.080]  We'll quit talking about the weather. Let's do a damn podcast.
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.400]  Weather update for everybody.
[01:42.440 --> 01:44.920]  Well that's that's grow from your weather with Rasta, Jeff and Mike.
[01:45.120 --> 01:48.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the show is brought to you by Oregon elite
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.640]  seeds. It is time to add fresh genetics to your garden and you can do so by
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.600]  visiting Oregon elite seeds.com. Make sure you check them out.
[01:56.920 --> 02:00.000]  It is a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what we are
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.360]  dabbing on. I've been dabbing more of that gelato cake batter from apothecary
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.840]  farms. I really enjoy that, but we're getting really weird today.
[02:09.080 --> 02:11.080]  We're getting crazy. If you listen to this sound right here,
[02:11.080 --> 02:12.480]  give me just a second. You'll hear this one.
[02:16.800 --> 02:19.680]  That's me smoking a bowl of delicious flour.
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.040]  I don't think I've seen you hit a pipe since the day we went legal in the
[02:25.400 --> 02:26.240]  reporters were here.
[02:27.360 --> 02:28.960]  That is, that is a good memory to bring up.
[02:29.400 --> 02:33.240]  I gave Mike a little bit of a dab earlier and I watched it just destroy his
[02:33.240 --> 02:34.880]  lungs. He coughed for several minutes.
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.200]  I'm fighting kind of a head cold and I didn't want to kill him again.
[02:38.200 --> 02:40.360]  So I packed up a bowl of some delicious flowers.
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.760]  That cold dry weather we shouldn't have brought up earlier is making it terrible
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.600]  on me.
[02:45.200 --> 02:47.280]  I got a little bit of that weed in my mouth, but that's okay.
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.040]  That's how it goes sometimes. Uh, the flowers we are smoking.
[02:50.040 --> 02:52.400]  I want to give a shout out to somebody who grew some amazing flower.
[02:52.440 --> 02:53.600]  Isn't it tasty, bro?
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.360]  That is, it's called Zookies and it's grown by our friend, golden growers.
[02:57.360 --> 03:01.960]  One so big shout out to golden growers. Yeah, good herb, dude. This is tasty.
[03:02.280 --> 03:05.640]  Uh, I love the flavor that's lingering on my mouth. I got to hit it again.
[03:06.080 --> 03:08.400]  Do it. If I really want to get the effects of what's going on here.
[03:08.440 --> 03:11.720]  I'm not going to get your, uh, your herpes syphilitis. Am I? No, I hope not.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.400]  I hope not. It might be contagious. That's what the fire's for.
[03:19.500 --> 03:27.200]  Nice and smooth. There we go. Let's go into the forehead.
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.160]  That's forehead high. Does that make any sense to you? Yes. I feel like in my,
[03:31.160 --> 03:34.880]  oh, it's in my third eye. You guys feel that in your third eye?
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.680]  Are you woke from smoking that bowl with us?
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.680]  Mike is going to cough for quite a while. All right, you guys,
[03:40.800 --> 03:41.880]  let's get a podcast going.
[03:41.880 --> 03:45.040]  Thank you for joining us for episode three 96 of the grow from your heart
[03:45.040 --> 03:47.000]  podcast. I hope I said the right number at the beginning.
[03:48.280 --> 03:50.360]  Let's jump right into it. Mike, in a previous episode,
[03:50.560 --> 03:51.680]  we brought up the question.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.840]  If you take a bong hit and you leave some smoke in the bong,
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.320]  what is that stale smoke that's left in the bong called in Mike's realm?
[03:59.520 --> 04:01.320]  I want you to say what you call it. What do you call that?
[04:01.760 --> 04:04.760]  That's a Buffalo fart is the term I've always heard to,
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.280]  to describe leaving smoke in a bong. No one,
[04:08.320 --> 04:11.080]  no one sent me anything saying it was different for a rig.
[04:11.400 --> 04:15.880]  A Buffalo fart. Yep. That's really interesting. Especially from you.
[04:16.560 --> 04:18.800]  The guy that's just not something that I really like. Hey Mike,
[04:18.840 --> 04:20.560]  what would you call this Buffalo fart, bro?
[04:20.600 --> 04:24.800]  That's really not like you're at a year like regular real house at all.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.520]  Yeah, that's totally random for you.
[04:26.520 --> 04:30.720]  So for that to be one of your terms is kind of strange in my, uh, in my hood,
[04:30.920 --> 04:34.160]  in my smoking circle where I'm from here, we called it re-bong,
[04:34.440 --> 04:36.120]  that old funky smoke left in there.
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.680]  So I asked you guys to tweet at us and let us know what you call that stale
[04:40.680 --> 04:42.360]  smoke that is left over in the bong.
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.440]  If you take a fat bong rip and there's still some gunk left in there when
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.320]  you're done, what do you call that nasty smoke?
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.680]  We got one great reply from our friends on Twitter.
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.720]  This reply came from my friend Aldridge. What up, bro? It's good to see you.
[04:52.720 --> 04:56.880]  Good to hear from you. He said, if I'm at home, I call it wasted cannabis.
[04:57.200 --> 04:59.680]  But in a situation where I took my first dab,
[04:59.920 --> 05:03.640]  I was a little scared of clearing the dab after watching the guy pass,
[05:03.840 --> 05:08.520]  clean the F out. My apologies, my apologies for wasting cannabis.
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.440]  Wasted medicine is what it is. Mike, you all right over there? Yeah.
[05:12.480 --> 05:14.960]  You drooled a little bit, bro. You're going in on that cough.
[05:14.960 --> 05:16.000]  You're not even the right color.
[05:16.400 --> 05:18.520]  So I kind of want to recap on what Aldridge said,
[05:18.520 --> 05:20.680]  because Mike was trying to steal the thunder by coughing over it.
[05:21.400 --> 05:22.480]  What are you doing over there, bro?
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.760]  I'm checking YouTube comments badly.
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.560]  Man, you were just disruptive today. We're not even going to edit that.
[05:26.560 --> 05:29.480]  I'm just going to leave that in the show. I can hear myself over myself.
[05:29.800 --> 05:34.160]  So Aldridge said, uh, I call it wasted cannabis,
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.240]  but he was in a situation where he took his first dab and he was scared to clear
[05:37.240 --> 05:40.480]  it because, uh, I was there when Aldridge took his first dab.
[05:40.480 --> 05:44.400]  I actually gave him his first dab and we did it at the dab lounge in Colorado
[05:44.400 --> 05:48.560]  Springs. And what he's talking about is moments before I gave him his first dab,
[05:48.560 --> 05:50.400]  we're hanging out, we're getting all set up at the table.
[05:50.400 --> 05:52.840]  I've got a dab scooped up for him. I'm about to give him a dab.
[05:52.840 --> 05:54.880]  I can see that he's nervous. He's telling me, bro,
[05:54.880 --> 05:57.640]  I'm so nervous to take my first dab and I'm trying to make them feel comfortable
[05:57.640 --> 05:59.440]  and calm. And then I hear this noise.
[06:00.640 --> 06:03.880]  And if anybody can't hear that through the mics, it was a loud table.
[06:04.240 --> 06:06.040]  It was a person just collapsing.
[06:06.040 --> 06:10.360]  They took a dab and they just fucking fell right over onto the table and knocked
[06:10.360 --> 06:12.720]  a glass off of the table, cleaned off the table,
[06:12.720 --> 06:14.720]  anything like drinks and pipes and bongs.
[06:14.720 --> 06:18.280]  You could hear it all smash onto the ground. It didn't sound pretty. Uh,
[06:18.280 --> 06:22.840]  me being a very experienced consumer and somebody who wants to mind my own
[06:22.840 --> 06:24.920]  business, I just sat there. I did knock it up.
[06:25.040 --> 06:27.280]  I sat right in the seat where I was. Uh,
[06:27.280 --> 06:30.640]  Aldridge did decide to get up and go see what was going on. And he's like,
[06:30.640 --> 06:33.000]  did I do pass clean the fuck out? And I was like, cool, sit down.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.280]  It's time to do a dab. And I could tell he was like, Oh no,
[06:36.320 --> 06:39.160]  he didn't want to be fucking fatality number two that day.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.800]  So he was a little bit scared, but bro,
[06:41.160 --> 06:45.160]  you did a really good job with your first dab. Don't feel like such a new, uh,
[06:45.200 --> 06:47.080]  you were a dabber now you're part of the crew.
[06:47.280 --> 06:50.640]  So I think it's funny that you were so nervous to take your first stab.
[06:50.920 --> 06:53.760]  And then I think it was just great timing that that dude passed. Uh,
[06:53.800 --> 06:56.520]  he said, clean the F out. So, and dude,
[06:56.680 --> 06:58.720]  you don't have to apologize for wasting cannabis. Uh,
[06:58.760 --> 07:01.160]  that was less than a half a dab that you didn't consume. And honestly,
[07:01.160 --> 07:02.760]  I'd rather you not smoke that whole thing.
[07:02.760 --> 07:05.480]  Then once you get all weird and paranoid the first time we hang out.
[07:05.880 --> 07:10.680]  Yeah. I remember the don't waste it mentality that was
[07:10.680 --> 07:14.800]  so prevalent when we were younger. I think we just sort of outgrew it.
[07:15.560 --> 07:16.680]  Like at a certain point,
[07:16.720 --> 07:21.560]  like you'd rather your friend not overdo it rather than see that
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.680]  half a hit get blown into the room.
[07:23.960 --> 07:27.640]  Well now it's not six of us pitching on a dime bag and everybody trying to get
[07:27.640 --> 07:30.560]  as high as we can off of fucking three joints. And there are six of us here.
[07:30.560 --> 07:33.520]  So it's, and we're all, we've, I've got several grams over here.
[07:33.520 --> 07:35.560]  If you take a dab and you choke and blow it up into the air,
[07:35.560 --> 07:37.800]  that's one for the dead homies. I'm not too stressed on it.
[07:38.680 --> 07:39.760]  One of the other, uh,
[07:39.800 --> 07:44.600]  I knew there was a YouTube submission for an answer to this question and Adam on
[07:44.600 --> 07:47.920]  YouTube call it says it's called mom, uh, mommy's milk.
[07:48.400 --> 07:50.360]  You should always finish your mommy's milk.
[07:51.560 --> 07:55.680]  I would definitely call that go with mothers rather than mommy's if I was going
[07:55.680 --> 07:58.360]  to use that term. But I got to say, I prefer Buffalo fart.
[07:58.520 --> 08:00.400]  I think, yeah, I think for the first time,
[08:00.400 --> 08:03.520]  I'm going to say that Buffalo fart wins, wins that one.
[08:03.760 --> 08:07.720]  It's not a terrible term. It is not. Once you compare it to the alternative,
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.920]  I'm going to stick with reballing just cause that's what we've always said in my
[08:10.920 --> 08:12.000]  circle. And I bet if we went,
[08:12.120 --> 08:14.440]  reballing is pretty good too. That's a solid term.
[08:14.440 --> 08:17.080]  If we went back to where we used to go smoke back over at, uh,
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.920]  at the red room and we pulled out the bong, man,
[08:19.920 --> 08:22.360]  I wonder how many people just got flashbacks of the red room.
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.280]  And somebody said Buffalo fart, nobody would know what we meant.
[08:25.320 --> 08:28.400]  But if we said clear your reballing, somebody would know exactly what we meant.
[08:30.080 --> 08:33.480]  I, uh, I hadn't heard Buffalo fart in forever.
[08:34.120 --> 08:36.040]  And about a year ago,
[08:36.040 --> 08:40.760]  we were in a room with a group of people in the afternoon and one of the people
[08:40.760 --> 08:44.160]  in the room was sort of famous for not being able to hit a bomb correctly.
[08:44.640 --> 08:49.040]  They continue to draw through the bowl and into the bong
[08:49.520 --> 08:52.960]  repeatedly taking like sip hits off the top of the, you know,
[08:54.040 --> 08:57.720]  but taking sip hits off the top of the bong while continuously pulling more and
[08:57.740 --> 09:00.680]  more smoke into the, the apparatus.
[09:00.680 --> 09:05.640]  And then they'd hand it off with like nine sipped hits taken
[09:05.640 --> 09:08.280]  off of it and a huge cloud still inside it.
[09:08.880 --> 09:11.440]  And one day I made the mistake of just clearing it normally.
[09:11.840 --> 09:13.920]  And while I was hacking and coughing, somebody was like, dude,
[09:13.920 --> 09:16.320]  you never suck a Buffalo fart out. What's wrong with you?
[09:16.920 --> 09:19.720]  And I about died because I hadn't heard the term in a decade.
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.800]  Suck a Buffalo fart out. Just makes it way different.
[09:24.560 --> 09:27.880]  I think that's part of where the term came from. I agree. But man,
[09:28.160 --> 09:30.760]  Buffalo farts should be blown out, not sucked.
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.720]  It tastes different when you say it that way. It's got a flavor.
[09:34.760 --> 09:35.600]  All right.
[09:36.440 --> 09:38.760]  Mike had a couple of technical difficulties.
[09:38.760 --> 09:40.040]  I've stuttered a couple of times.
[09:40.060 --> 09:43.160]  Let's put this podcast back on the adult rails.
[09:43.200 --> 09:44.360]  I don't even want to say adult rails.
[09:44.360 --> 09:47.160]  That sounds like we're about to do something even extra fucking weird. Right?
[09:47.280 --> 09:51.040]  Let's put it back on a normal track here. Let's get a podcast going. Mike,
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.120]  I invited you to the show because there is a new bill coming forward.
[09:55.120 --> 09:57.360]  It is bill 420. Yep.
[09:57.360 --> 09:59.040]  Set a bill for 20.
[09:59.400 --> 10:02.600]  What can you tell me and my audience,
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.560]  my audience and myself, the audience and myself, um,
[10:06.640 --> 10:10.840]  our audience and the listeners and I, well, dear listeners,
[10:11.240 --> 10:12.600]  and I want to be included.
[10:13.280 --> 10:13.720]  Um,
[10:13.720 --> 10:18.560]  Senate bill 420 is a federal decriminalization
[10:18.560 --> 10:20.280]  bill. Um,
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.280]  they're describing it as a bill to federally decriminalize,
[10:25.320 --> 10:29.400]  regulate and tax marijuana products. Um,
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.040]  they've gone ahead and reserved the name S period for 20 or
[10:34.040 --> 10:36.720]  Senate bill for 20. Um,
[10:37.720 --> 10:42.280]  senators can go ahead and reserve a number for the year. And like last year,
[10:42.280 --> 10:46.880]  they used S for 20 as well, but that was 2018 S for 20.
[10:46.880 --> 10:50.200]  This is 2019 S for 20. Um,
[10:50.680 --> 10:54.240]  matching legislation has been submitted to the house of representatives under a
[10:54.320 --> 10:56.000]  totally different number. Um,
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.040]  but they had submitted to both houses when they do stuff like this.
[10:59.800 --> 11:00.640]  Um,
[11:02.360 --> 11:06.560]  this is actually three bills, uh, 420, 421 and 422.
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.520]  If you really want to pull the language of the bill and read it for yourself.
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.880]  Um, but the package of legislation was filed by Senator Ron Wyden of
[11:15.920 --> 11:18.400]  Oregon on February 7th of this year.
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.160]  It seeks to update tax law by providing for the taxation and regulation
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.160]  of marijuana products. And for other purposes, basically banking,
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.200]  um, the bill is officially called the marijuana revenue and regulation act.
[11:34.920 --> 11:39.680]  Um, and then the article I'm skimming comments on the number four 20
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.280]  honored honors the marijuana community. Um,
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.880]  I shake my head when they use four 20 and seven 10 for stuff like this.
[11:48.240 --> 11:51.840]  I feel like it's the cop show where the cop is insisting on using the street name
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.040]  and the interview. Um, it's just don't,
[11:56.280 --> 11:59.360]  you look insane when you do it, but that's just my personal take.
[11:59.400 --> 12:01.360]  You don't like it when the cops call it the cush.
[12:02.720 --> 12:05.960]  It's just, it's cringe worthy. Um, it's,
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.120]  uh, just no, don't when you can avoid it, avoid it. But listeners,
[12:12.120 --> 12:15.200]  I don't think any of you are going to submit federal legislation. Um,
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.720]  so I don't know why I'm ranting about this. It's just one of my tangents. Um,
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.440]  going with the four 20, um, representative for the house of representatives,
[12:26.440 --> 12:29.920]  Earl Blummeyer has reserved HR four 20, um,
[12:29.920 --> 12:34.360]  for a house bill that will do similar things, um,
[12:34.400 --> 12:37.040]  mainly for Oregon. But, uh,
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.320]  this S four 20 widens bill as part of a legislative package that would lay the
[12:42.320 --> 12:43.960]  foundation for responsible,
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.160]  comprehensive federal regulation of marijuana. Um,
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.080]  according to a statement from the Senator who serves on the Senate's committee
[12:52.120 --> 12:54.800]  on finance, as part of the package,
[12:54.800 --> 12:57.560]  Blummeyer filed an identical piece of legislation in the house,
[12:57.560 --> 13:00.480]  which is called, uh, HR one, one, two, zero.
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.360]  That's the companion bill to S four 20. Um,
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.920]  as I mentioned earlier, this package of bills includes S four 21 and S four 22.
[13:10.480 --> 13:11.080]  Um,
[13:11.080 --> 13:14.960]  the former would aim to shrink the gap between federal and state marijuana
[13:14.960 --> 13:15.800]  policies.
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.000]  And the latter aims to treat marijuana businesses like any other small business
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.200]  when it comes to their tax bills, which means the end of two 80 E.
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.800]  Um, or at least two 80 E's application to lead state legal marijuana businesses.
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.520]  Um, if you're in the industry, you know how big that could be for us. Um,
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.640]  right now, this bill is in its infancy. Um,
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.880]  and given all of the shenanigans at the federal government level recently, um,
[13:44.920 --> 13:49.800]  who knows how smooth this process is going to be, uh, basically listeners,
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.200]  if you haven't been following marijuana politics as closely as I have for the
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.040]  last decade, um, every year,
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.920]  at least one or two senators get together and submit a bill like this.
[14:01.360 --> 14:05.520]  And 10 times out of 10, it goes nowhere. It dies in committee.
[14:05.520 --> 14:10.520]  You never hear about it after the initial press release saying there's a
[14:10.760 --> 14:14.480]  marijuana legalization bill. Here's its funny number. Um,
[14:14.480 --> 14:16.440]  and then it's going to committee next week.
[14:16.440 --> 14:18.440]  And then that's all you ever hear because it dies in committee.
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.240]  I have more hope now. Um, there's,
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.280]  we're going into another presidential election this next round. Um,
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.520]  we can decide if we keep Trump or pick anybody else. And, uh,
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.440]  along with that stuff like this is going to get a lot more national attention.
[14:35.960 --> 14:36.800]  Um,
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.280]  Trump's white house has played the marijuana question a lot different than
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.920]  their predecessors. Surprise, surprise. Um,
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.160]  not that that's a good or a bad thing yet.
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.480]  We really don't know that's the bananas thing about the Trump administration is
[14:51.480 --> 14:53.280]  it's really hard to tell if they're going left, right,
[14:53.280 --> 14:56.480]  or forward and on any issue.
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.000]  And so we have no idea if they're anti-cannabis pro cannabis or ignoring
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.680]  cannabis. Um,
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.720]  so we could see the white house support one of the several federal pieces of
[15:07.960 --> 15:12.720]  legislation that would either deregulate cannabis federally, um,
[15:12.720 --> 15:15.080]  reschedule it, or, um,
[15:15.240 --> 15:20.240]  let states expand their existing programs if they've legalized it already at
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.280]  the state level or at changes to banking bills,
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.800]  we could see the white house get behind any of those or none of those.
[15:26.800 --> 15:29.920]  It's really an up in the air question at this point.
[15:30.680 --> 15:33.840]  Traditionally the white house stays out of anything marijuana related.
[15:34.320 --> 15:37.080]  They just prefer not to take a stance. And when they're pressed,
[15:37.120 --> 15:39.160]  they say we were waiting for Congress to act.
[15:39.800 --> 15:41.720]  And that's sort of a tall order right now,
[15:41.880 --> 15:44.920]  but waiting for Congress to act is what this bill would be.
[15:44.920 --> 15:46.720]  So we'll see where it goes.
[15:47.360 --> 15:52.280]  So what are the next steps who can approve or veto this? What can happen?
[15:52.280 --> 15:54.480]  Where what's the next chain of command? I'm going to take a dab.
[15:54.480 --> 15:57.160]  So what are the next two or three steps in the chain of command?
[15:57.480 --> 16:00.280]  Okay. So this bill goes to committee first,
[16:00.720 --> 16:03.200]  the committee digs through and looks to see like,
[16:03.200 --> 16:05.680]  does the Senate have the authority to,
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.480]  to regulate and legislate stuff like this? Um,
[16:10.560 --> 16:12.600]  they debate the merits of the bill. Sometimes,
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.440]  sometimes they debate debate the optics of the bill or don't debate it at all.
[16:16.840 --> 16:20.120]  And it just never comes up for discussion and committee and dies there.
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.200]  You want to clear that dad, since your lungs are already collapsed. Yeah.
[16:23.200 --> 16:26.360]  Go ahead and fill that out. Okay. So there are several more steps here.
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.360]  I'm going to cut you off because you've already given myself and the listeners,
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.880]  the idea that there are several steps and several opportunities for this to just
[16:32.880 --> 16:34.440]  get nicks. This could go away.
[16:35.240 --> 16:38.200]  This could completely be something we talked about and didn't come to any
[16:38.200 --> 16:42.000]  fruition. Uh, what kind of, I know you're choking.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  I want to ask you questions.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.160]  I'm going to try to ramble just like you do for me when I'm dabbing.
[16:45.600 --> 16:48.560]  The next thing I want to know is what kind of timeline do we have before we're
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.440]  going to start seeing progress of this moving forward? And, um,
[16:53.920 --> 16:56.600]  yeah. What kind of timeline, if it does get shot down,
[16:56.600 --> 16:58.680]  is that going to be in a month? Is that going to be in three months?
[16:58.680 --> 17:01.520]  And then how long are we going to know if this actually gets approved?
[17:01.840 --> 17:06.440]  So in, sorry, listeners in three to six months,
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.840]  we'll know if this specific bill is going to move forward in any meaningful way.
[17:12.600 --> 17:15.920]  And the likelihood of that is very, very small. Okay.
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.120]  Now, once it gets shot down, is that like a game over?
[17:21.120 --> 17:24.480]  Or can they go back to the drawing board, cross a few words out,
[17:24.480 --> 17:26.080]  reinsert a few words and bring it back?
[17:26.080 --> 17:27.600]  Or is that done for the year at that point?
[17:28.440 --> 17:30.640]  So at that point, um,
[17:30.680 --> 17:34.760]  there's really no bringing back this version of the bill this year. However,
[17:34.760 --> 17:37.480]  there's several other bills, um,
[17:37.520 --> 17:41.560]  that do very similar things in similar ways that have already been submitted.
[17:41.960 --> 17:46.160]  Or will be submitted later this year. I sort of mentioned one earlier, um,
[17:46.360 --> 17:49.720]  out of Oregon and rep Bluemire's office, I think is sponsoring it.
[17:50.240 --> 17:53.080]  That's getting submitted through the house of representatives first.
[17:53.760 --> 17:55.920]  So we at least have a backup plan if this does not work.
[17:56.080 --> 17:59.320]  And it's not like this is the first time this has ever happened.
[17:59.320 --> 18:03.760]  This happens every year and has for eight or 10 or 15 years in a row. Now,
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.920]  the upside is we've done this before with other things where the feds say,
[18:09.960 --> 18:14.960]  where the feds say one thing in the States slowly one by one go,
[18:16.440 --> 18:19.960]  and now we're going to do this. And at a certain point,
[18:19.960 --> 18:21.280]  usually when you get to about 30,
[18:21.280 --> 18:24.840]  35 States in disagreement with the feds, um,
[18:24.880 --> 18:29.760]  the feds are forced to really reexamine their position and decide like if they
[18:29.760 --> 18:34.040]  did with raising the alcohol or the drinking age to 21, um,
[18:34.640 --> 18:37.480]  if they really start making threats to bring States in line,
[18:38.120 --> 18:42.080]  or if they do with so many other things where they go, you know what, our,
[18:42.080 --> 18:47.080]  our policy is out of alignment with the views of the American public and federal
[18:47.240 --> 18:52.240]  policy finally gets changed because so many States have taken that step first.
[18:53.160 --> 18:57.760]  Um, and we're sort of reaching traditional tipping point numbers now. Awesome.
[18:57.800 --> 18:59.400]  At least with medical marijuana.
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.440]  And then honestly if you look at federal action on medical marijuana stuff,
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.200]  they told us to go fuck ourselves from 1970 till 2014 2013 ish.
[19:14.880 --> 19:18.480]  And finally they started saying, okay, maybe some of you have a point.
[19:18.480 --> 19:22.680]  We'll start allowing more people to do the medical research,
[19:22.680 --> 19:25.440]  to look for medical benefits. Um,
[19:25.600 --> 19:30.600]  the FDA finally called uncle for the first time in 60 years and said they'll
[19:30.720 --> 19:32.520]  open up more, um,
[19:32.560 --> 19:36.920]  production facilities other than just the university of Mississippi for cannabis
[19:36.920 --> 19:38.120]  product for these tests.
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.760]  Now that's a great way you kind of set me up.
[19:39.760 --> 19:42.240]  I had this set up as one of my later on questions.
[19:42.520 --> 19:46.680]  Do you think if this does go through that this will be the beginning of the end
[19:46.680 --> 19:49.240]  and a lot of people in a lot of other places are going to say it's already the
[19:49.240 --> 19:50.120]  beginning of the end,
[19:50.200 --> 19:53.080]  but the beginning of the end of any medical marijuana program,
[19:53.120 --> 19:56.720]  if we have a national decriminalized cannabis program,
[19:56.800 --> 20:00.480]  do you think that's going to start destroying medical marijuana programs?
[20:00.680 --> 20:02.400]  Yes and no. Okay. Um,
[20:02.760 --> 20:06.000]  what we know now is sort of
[20:08.080 --> 20:10.320]  horrible not to,
[20:11.440 --> 20:13.120]  to be overdramatic or anything.
[20:13.120 --> 20:18.120]  But when you look at all traditional forms of medicine and it's not just like
[20:18.560 --> 20:21.240]  big pharma pills, but all medicine,
[20:21.560 --> 20:26.440]  whether it's splinting a broken bone or healing a cut or stitches,
[20:26.840 --> 20:29.160]  all medicine goes through a specific process.
[20:29.640 --> 20:34.640]  And we were forced to go outside of the traditional processes for medical
[20:35.400 --> 20:36.240]  marijuana.
[20:36.240 --> 20:39.840]  It's part of the reason we had to build our own testing labs in infrastructure
[20:39.840 --> 20:44.200]  and shit was because we can't use the labs that test literally every other
[20:44.200 --> 20:46.000]  product on the planet.
[20:47.480 --> 20:47.560]  Um,
[20:47.560 --> 20:51.840]  a lot of that's going to go away and we'll be able to use the infrastructure
[20:51.840 --> 20:52.800]  that's already there.
[20:53.600 --> 20:54.440]  Um,
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.600]  what we have now we get expanded drastically is the research into other
[20:58.680 --> 20:59.520]  cannabinoids,
[21:00.120 --> 21:00.160]  um,
[21:00.160 --> 21:02.480]  really explodes right now.
[21:02.480 --> 21:03.600]  I don't know any other,
[21:03.720 --> 21:08.720]  any THC V or CBG or CBC breeders.
[21:09.920 --> 21:14.200]  We're going to start to see the emergence of people focusing on lots of stuff we
[21:14.200 --> 21:16.080]  don't see now as this expands.
[21:16.120 --> 21:16.920]  Random note,
[21:16.920 --> 21:21.160]  you know where the THC V has been commonly found that is,
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.800]  from what I understand it is in the African land race strains,
[21:25.280 --> 21:25.320]  uh,
[21:25.320 --> 21:29.400]  such as Durban poison also in the storm or the double dragon.
[21:29.400 --> 21:30.720]  It comes through in the double dragon.
[21:30.720 --> 21:31.560]  If you lab tested,
[21:31.560 --> 21:33.480]  it's got the THC V from the Durban.
[21:33.480 --> 21:35.680]  So a lot of the African land races are bringing that.
[21:36.120 --> 21:37.760]  But do you remember how much the,
[21:39.160 --> 21:42.800]  the breeding and the genetics game changed when people like you and me got
[21:42.800 --> 21:43.720]  access to labs?
[21:45.240 --> 21:48.360]  That's around the same time that everybody went CBD crazy.
[21:48.400 --> 21:49.240]  So yes,
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.640]  we're going to see the same thing on a much grander scale.
[21:52.760 --> 21:54.600]  I'm watching it with the hemp game right now.
[21:54.920 --> 21:55.920]  It's tremendous.
[21:58.240 --> 21:59.920]  I could do a whole episode on,
[22:00.520 --> 22:02.240]  on hemp testing right now with those.
[22:02.280 --> 22:05.120]  There's two cases going on right now where people were shipping hemp and got in
[22:05.120 --> 22:05.360]  trouble.
[22:05.360 --> 22:06.200]  Oh yeah.
[22:06.680 --> 22:08.640]  There are other podcasts have been covering those pretty well.
[22:08.640 --> 22:10.120]  So I haven't delved in delve.
[22:10.160 --> 22:11.640]  Is that a word that you have delved?
[22:11.680 --> 22:12.040]  Yep.
[22:12.040 --> 22:12.880]  I haven't done that.
[22:12.920 --> 22:15.120]  I haven't delved into them because I feel like they've been covered,
[22:15.120 --> 22:16.320]  but if you ever want to talk about it,
[22:16.320 --> 22:17.160]  you bring it up.
[22:17.160 --> 22:18.880]  I could go on a massive ramp,
[22:18.880 --> 22:21.360]  but I want to stay kind of close to this with,
[22:21.360 --> 22:22.200]  uh,
[22:22.360 --> 22:23.480]  with medical anyway,
[22:23.480 --> 22:23.800]  we have,
[22:23.800 --> 22:26.560]  we've seen quite a bit of federal action that we,
[22:26.560 --> 22:31.560]  they've just been adamant not to do for the last 50 or 60 years from an
[22:32.560 --> 22:35.480]  outsider's perspective that doesn't watch this stuff as closely.
[22:35.840 --> 22:38.480]  The action we've seen federally seems pretty minimal.
[22:39.520 --> 22:44.120]  The steps the feds have taken have all been super baby step and it doesn't make
[22:44.120 --> 22:48.720]  a lot of sense if you don't follow this stuff really closely because until very
[22:48.720 --> 22:49.200]  recently,
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.880]  we just had no progress for decades after that decade after decade after
[22:52.880 --> 22:53.720]  decade.
[22:53.720 --> 22:57.800]  Like we beat these fuckers in court in 82 the year I was born.
[22:58.600 --> 22:58.640]  Uh,
[22:58.640 --> 23:01.160]  the feds got taken to court in the DEA.
[23:02.120 --> 23:02.760]  Um,
[23:02.760 --> 23:03.680]  they rigged the game.
[23:03.680 --> 23:04.520]  They had,
[23:04.640 --> 23:04.680]  uh,
[23:04.680 --> 23:05.840]  their own law judge,
[23:05.840 --> 23:07.200]  a DEA law judge,
[23:07.760 --> 23:08.200]  um,
[23:08.200 --> 23:12.880]  was the judge for the case and ended up ruling in our favor saying cannabis is
[23:12.880 --> 23:15.520]  clearly by all evidence presented,
[23:15.600 --> 23:16.080]  um,
[23:16.080 --> 23:18.800]  remarkably medically active and remarkably safe.
[23:19.440 --> 23:19.680]  Um,
[23:19.680 --> 23:23.480]  and that ruling eventually led to the creation of the federal medical marijuana
[23:23.480 --> 23:26.440]  program where they send pot to patients,
[23:27.040 --> 23:27.400]  um,
[23:27.400 --> 23:29.280]  which is a whole nother episode as well.
[23:29.760 --> 23:30.040]  But,
[23:30.040 --> 23:30.720]  uh,
[23:30.720 --> 23:35.680]  we've won in court in federal court with their own ringer judge is the
[23:35.680 --> 23:36.520]  decider.
[23:36.680 --> 23:39.000]  And we've still seen zero action,
[23:39.640 --> 23:40.040]  um,
[23:40.040 --> 23:40.840]  until very,
[23:40.840 --> 23:44.240]  very recently when the feds have started to really move on this stuff.
[23:44.920 --> 23:45.160]  Um,
[23:45.160 --> 23:48.120]  and I think we're going to see a lot more progress over the next few years,
[23:48.120 --> 23:49.080]  but I mean,
[23:49.080 --> 23:54.080]  that's assuming a lot of stuff you really never know where our wonderful
[23:54.080 --> 23:55.800]  president is going to drive this bus.
[23:57.840 --> 23:59.480]  I'm going to try to avoid that.
[23:59.760 --> 24:00.600]  Um,
[24:01.120 --> 24:04.800]  so one thing you said earlier that I think we should clear up for listeners is
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.160]  what is the difference between decriminalization and legalization?
[24:08.880 --> 24:09.160]  Okay.
[24:09.160 --> 24:10.920]  So decriminalization,
[24:11.520 --> 24:11.880]  um,
[24:11.880 --> 24:13.240]  the short version is,
[24:13.800 --> 24:14.520]  um,
[24:14.520 --> 24:15.880]  end market consumers.
[24:15.880 --> 24:17.600]  So people that just smoke weed,
[24:17.600 --> 24:18.420]  some,
[24:18.780 --> 24:19.500]  um,
[24:19.500 --> 24:21.100]  get taken out of the legal,
[24:21.340 --> 24:22.180]  um,
[24:22.820 --> 24:24.460]  system for cannabis.
[24:24.900 --> 24:26.700]  It's still illegal to grow it.
[24:26.700 --> 24:28.420]  It's still illegal to have a bunch of it.
[24:28.780 --> 24:31.300]  It's definitely still illegal to sell some to your friend.
[24:32.020 --> 24:32.500]  Um,
[24:32.500 --> 24:34.540]  but if the cop says,
[24:34.540 --> 24:34.780]  Hey,
[24:34.780 --> 24:35.900]  what are you doing wrong?
[24:35.980 --> 24:40.220]  And the only thing they can get you for is has a small personal amount of weed
[24:40.220 --> 24:41.300]  with them currently,
[24:41.740 --> 24:46.260]  then you don't get in trouble legally the first time
[24:46.980 --> 24:48.460]  that's decriminalization.
[24:49.060 --> 24:49.540]  Um,
[24:49.540 --> 24:52.060]  without going to full legalization,
[24:52.060 --> 24:56.460]  you can't have things like storefronts or zoning laws or taxes.
[24:57.100 --> 24:57.500]  Um,
[24:57.500 --> 24:58.780]  that's the big two,
[24:59.220 --> 25:01.140]  the big difference between those two policies.
[25:01.500 --> 25:02.020]  Okay.
[25:02.020 --> 25:02.700]  Um,
[25:02.700 --> 25:03.540]  recently,
[25:04.220 --> 25:04.660]  um,
[25:04.660 --> 25:06.140]  because you brought this up,
[25:06.660 --> 25:10.460]  the anti pot community has realized that we should prohibit.
[25:10.460 --> 25:14.100]  This is no longer an effective argument and no one listens.
[25:14.740 --> 25:14.980]  Um,
[25:14.980 --> 25:19.980]  basically as soon as they start talking about arresting users and full on
[25:20.300 --> 25:20.980]  prohibition,
[25:20.980 --> 25:22.980]  like we've traditionally had with cannabis,
[25:23.740 --> 25:27.100]  people laugh at them and go away and completely stop listening.
[25:27.100 --> 25:31.500]  And so they've started pretending that they're decriminalization advocates.
[25:31.820 --> 25:33.900]  They don't want to see users go to jail,
[25:34.260 --> 25:35.780]  which they don't think happens.
[25:36.460 --> 25:36.780]  Um,
[25:36.780 --> 25:38.700]  but they don't want it to see it happen.
[25:38.740 --> 25:39.100]  And,
[25:39.100 --> 25:39.260]  uh,
[25:39.260 --> 25:41.500]  they pretend to be decriminalization advocates,
[25:41.500 --> 25:44.500]  which is weird because Vermont basically did.
[25:44.820 --> 25:47.300]  Decriminalization last year.
[25:47.500 --> 25:48.300]  Um,
[25:49.100 --> 25:49.860]  early last year,
[25:49.860 --> 25:51.340]  I think through the legislature,
[25:51.740 --> 25:53.060]  Vermont legalized,
[25:53.060 --> 25:57.980]  but they legalized without any infrastructure or commercial industry.
[25:57.980 --> 25:58.820]  It's just,
[25:58.940 --> 26:02.940]  you're allowed to grow a couple of plants at home and keep what you harvest.
[26:03.020 --> 26:03.460]  Um,
[26:03.460 --> 26:07.220]  and maybe share it with an adult friend who comes to your house and doesn't
[26:07.220 --> 26:08.060]  leave with a lot.
[26:08.380 --> 26:09.820]  Nice and vague up there in Vermont.
[26:09.980 --> 26:10.260]  Yeah.
[26:10.260 --> 26:11.220]  They're working on,
[26:11.220 --> 26:11.660]  uh,
[26:11.700 --> 26:14.860]  it was the first attempt at a legislature to legalize.
[26:15.380 --> 26:19.540]  And they had a bunch of anti-pot people flood the state at the last minute and
[26:19.540 --> 26:20.980]  really fearmonger pretty hard.
[26:21.620 --> 26:22.460]  Um,
[26:22.740 --> 26:26.660]  and they got their governor to back off from a commercial industry to,
[26:27.180 --> 26:27.460]  um,
[26:27.460 --> 26:29.260]  just a decriminalization model.
[26:29.620 --> 26:32.820]  But the anti-pot community didn't get behind that decriminalization model at
[26:32.820 --> 26:33.420]  all.
[26:33.420 --> 26:34.140]  They fought it.
[26:34.140 --> 26:35.860]  They bitched about the loss in Vermont.
[26:36.260 --> 26:37.380]  And then six months later,
[26:37.380 --> 26:40.700]  when Vermont started talking about doing the full commercial industry and full
[26:40.700 --> 26:41.540]  legalization,
[26:41.980 --> 26:43.180]  they came out again and were like,
[26:43.220 --> 26:45.260]  but this model you've got now is terrible.
[26:45.260 --> 26:46.260]  Why would you expand it?
[26:46.900 --> 26:47.260]  It's like,
[26:47.260 --> 26:47.460]  yeah,
[26:47.460 --> 26:48.580]  you can't be both that.
[26:48.620 --> 26:49.460]  Yeah.
[26:53.420 --> 26:56.900]  One of the best things I see coming out of this so far is the opportunity for
[26:56.900 --> 26:57.620]  banking.
[26:57.620 --> 26:59.540]  That's one of the things that we lack in this industry.
[26:59.540 --> 27:00.380]  It's so huge.
[27:00.740 --> 27:04.860]  There's independent banking legislation that just had a hearing this week,
[27:05.460 --> 27:06.300]  um,
[27:06.380 --> 27:11.380]  that looks to dial back 280 E's impact on legal cannabis
[27:11.380 --> 27:12.220]  businesses.
[27:12.700 --> 27:13.540]  Um,
[27:14.300 --> 27:19.020]  our elected officials are really starting to understand that insisting an
[27:19.020 --> 27:23.940]  industry that does six to 10 billion in business a year operate as cash only
[27:23.940 --> 27:25.260]  is not a smart move.
[27:25.860 --> 27:30.860]  If they want to be able to easily confirm that a business is operating on the up
[27:30.940 --> 27:34.300]  and up operating as a cash only business makes that a lot harder,
[27:34.820 --> 27:35.420]  um,
[27:35.420 --> 27:37.540]  paying the right amount of taxes,
[27:37.780 --> 27:38.380]  payroll,
[27:38.380 --> 27:40.420]  and it makes you a huge target for thieves.
[27:40.420 --> 27:44.100]  And that comes with federal regulation is the banking and tracking the money.
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.100]  And yeah,
[27:45.100 --> 27:45.700]  that's part of it.
[27:45.700 --> 27:47.220]  So I'm glad that they're going to let us,
[27:47.540 --> 27:47.860]  uh,
[27:47.860 --> 27:48.700]  claim the money.
[27:48.780 --> 27:50.340]  I have friends talking about it now.
[27:50.340 --> 27:50.660]  They're,
[27:50.660 --> 27:51.820]  they're not sure they're going to do it.
[27:51.820 --> 27:52.060]  Right.
[27:52.060 --> 27:52.860]  It's got to happen.
[27:52.860 --> 27:53.300]  Eventually.
[27:53.300 --> 27:54.940]  There's so much money in that industry.
[27:55.260 --> 27:55.460]  Uh,
[27:55.460 --> 27:56.820]  there are folks like you and I,
[27:56.820 --> 27:57.060]  who,
[27:57.060 --> 27:59.420]  when we worked for the grow where we worked,
[27:59.740 --> 28:03.700]  we may go to places and try to apply for credit for a new car or whatever we were
[28:03.700 --> 28:04.540]  trying to buy.
[28:04.660 --> 28:05.100]  And they'd say,
[28:05.100 --> 28:05.780]  where do you work?
[28:05.780 --> 28:06.460]  And I'd say,
[28:06.460 --> 28:07.820]  I throw out the,
[28:08.060 --> 28:08.420]  uh,
[28:08.420 --> 28:09.780]  the doing business as name.
[28:09.820 --> 28:11.100]  They're their development name.
[28:11.100 --> 28:12.340]  I work for this company and they'd say,
[28:12.340 --> 28:12.940]  what is that?
[28:12.940 --> 28:13.260]  And I'd say,
[28:13.260 --> 28:15.020]  it's a dispensary grow.
[28:15.180 --> 28:15.540]  And then it go,
[28:15.540 --> 28:15.700]  yeah,
[28:15.700 --> 28:16.940]  we don't give loans to you guys.
[28:16.940 --> 28:17.860]  You can't buy a car from us.
[28:17.860 --> 28:18.500]  Have a nice day.
[28:19.820 --> 28:22.380]  If this bill does pass and we can work with the banks,
[28:22.860 --> 28:23.060]  uh,
[28:23.060 --> 28:25.660]  people that have worked in this industry that have are working hard.
[28:25.660 --> 28:26.820]  They're working as managers,
[28:26.820 --> 28:27.580]  as consultants,
[28:27.580 --> 28:28.340]  they're working as,
[28:28.700 --> 28:29.020]  uh,
[28:29.020 --> 28:30.300]  representatives for companies.
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.620]  They're doing real legitimate jobs.
[28:31.620 --> 28:35.220]  They can actually go and get loans for houses and pay their bills legitimately
[28:35.500 --> 28:37.500]  legitimately like they're trying to do.
[28:37.700 --> 28:39.300]  So that'll be really advantageous.
[28:39.500 --> 28:39.660]  No,
[28:39.660 --> 28:40.020]  I,
[28:40.020 --> 28:42.340]  I really did not like as an employee,
[28:42.780 --> 28:46.100]  having to take an envelope full of cash to the bank.
[28:46.100 --> 28:47.500]  I brief every other Friday.
[28:47.620 --> 28:47.900]  Right.
[28:48.100 --> 28:52.860]  And even though I was kind of in a weird situation where I was working at the
[28:52.860 --> 28:53.580]  dispensary,
[28:53.580 --> 28:57.460]  when the bank representative came in and begged for our employee accounts.
[28:58.300 --> 28:59.140]  Um,
[28:59.180 --> 29:02.300]  but even then when I'd go to take my paycheck,
[29:02.340 --> 29:06.220]  the teller would see the huge stack of tens and twenties and go,
[29:06.660 --> 29:06.900]  Oh,
[29:06.900 --> 29:08.700]  I don't want to want to know where this is from.
[29:09.140 --> 29:12.220]  Like every payday I had to deal with that.
[29:12.300 --> 29:15.340]  And I'm sure there are people that aren't like,
[29:15.420 --> 29:17.220]  I'm a fairly large human.
[29:18.260 --> 29:19.220]  It's I'm six,
[29:19.220 --> 29:19.580]  three,
[29:19.580 --> 29:20.580]  250 pounds.
[29:20.580 --> 29:21.780]  Like I'm a big person.
[29:22.500 --> 29:23.940]  People don't often bother me,
[29:24.820 --> 29:27.700]  but I worked with a lot of five foot,
[29:27.700 --> 29:32.140]  two hundred and one pound female coworkers who were also
[29:32.140 --> 29:36.620]  leaving late at night with a huge envelope of cash in their pocket.
[29:37.060 --> 29:38.020]  And I,
[29:38.180 --> 29:39.500]  I wasn't comfortable.
[29:39.820 --> 29:40.660]  Right.
[29:41.060 --> 29:42.420]  How did they like,
[29:42.420 --> 29:43.060]  it's just an,
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.900]  it's not a tenable system.
[29:44.900 --> 29:46.700]  It's the system is untenable.
[29:47.060 --> 29:47.940]  There was a place,
[29:48.020 --> 29:52.380]  another place which we worked together that only paid us every two weeks and
[29:52.500 --> 29:56.460]  cash twenties because they kept all the hundreds and fifties for themselves.
[29:56.460 --> 29:56.980]  That place.
[29:56.980 --> 29:58.540]  I got tens more often than not.
[29:58.540 --> 29:58.660]  Oh,
[29:58.660 --> 29:59.500]  I got all the twenties.
[29:59.820 --> 30:00.260]  Yeah.
[30:00.260 --> 30:02.340]  You were a few rungs up the ladder for me.
[30:02.820 --> 30:03.180]  Um,
[30:03.180 --> 30:05.020]  but us lowly level service and,
[30:05.060 --> 30:06.300]  and customer service people,
[30:06.300 --> 30:09.500]  we're getting paid in twenties and tens more often than not.
[30:09.980 --> 30:14.900]  And when you show up with two weeks worth of paid and a moderate
[30:14.900 --> 30:17.860]  rate and you hand that to a bank teller,
[30:18.340 --> 30:19.660]  they got fucking questions.
[30:19.660 --> 30:23.300]  Cause the only other people that come in with all tens are selling $10 crack
[30:24.380 --> 30:25.500]  and you've got to explain,
[30:25.540 --> 30:26.100]  Oh no,
[30:26.100 --> 30:30.740]  like it's just my business is it's a cash only store.
[30:30.740 --> 30:35.460]  They can't pay me with a check because it's illegal and banks won't work with
[30:35.500 --> 30:35.740]  them. Right.
[30:35.740 --> 30:36.820]  As a huge pain in the ass.
[30:36.820 --> 30:38.340]  Please help me launder this money.
[30:39.380 --> 30:41.580]  I it's cynical of me to,
[30:41.660 --> 30:42.460]  to think this,
[30:42.460 --> 30:46.580]  but I think the anti-pot crowd fights banking access so hard.
[30:46.900 --> 30:50.420]  They claim it's because they're afraid Marlboro is going to invest in our
[30:50.420 --> 30:50.820]  company.
[30:50.820 --> 30:54.180]  You and me start and take over big tobacco is going to tape it,
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.060]  take it over.
[30:55.340 --> 30:59.380]  But I really think it's because if you took the huge piles of cash out of the
[30:59.380 --> 31:00.220]  gun safes,
[31:01.220 --> 31:06.220]  the infrequent dispensary robbers robberies would become even more infrequent
[31:06.780 --> 31:08.060]  and they would lose the talking point.
[31:09.380 --> 31:11.180]  I feel like that's why they fight so hard.
[31:11.620 --> 31:12.660]  That's a good argument there.
[31:12.700 --> 31:13.540]  I would agree with that.
[31:13.540 --> 31:18.540]  Like just because we pay rent reasonable federal taxes and are allowed to
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.540]  deposit our proceeds in the bank.
[31:21.060 --> 31:24.300]  Like that doesn't automatically mean anything other than the business is safe.
[31:25.260 --> 31:26.260]  They pretend like it's,
[31:26.300 --> 31:29.260]  we're going to get huge angel investors from evil corporations.
[31:29.300 --> 31:29.660]  And it's like,
[31:29.660 --> 31:30.860]  I thought we were evil on our own.
[31:30.860 --> 31:31.660]  Why do we need them?
[31:31.660 --> 31:32.900]  The storefronts are there.
[31:32.940 --> 31:33.820]  They're doing business.
[31:33.820 --> 31:35.860]  People are employed by the place.
[31:35.900 --> 31:37.820]  So there's commerce to be done.
[31:37.820 --> 31:39.660]  Somebody is making money by being there all day.
[31:40.420 --> 31:41.900]  That person is going to buy gas.
[31:41.940 --> 31:44.380]  They're going to buy food in the area because they get a lunch break.
[31:44.380 --> 31:45.660]  They probably live within,
[31:45.940 --> 31:46.260]  you know,
[31:46.260 --> 31:47.140]  10 or 15 minutes,
[31:47.140 --> 31:48.340]  maybe 20 minute drive away.
[31:48.340 --> 31:51.420]  So they're paying rent in that community with the money they make at that
[31:51.420 --> 31:52.260]  dispensary.
[31:52.460 --> 31:53.500]  People are shopping there.
[31:53.540 --> 31:54.420]  Money's coming in.
[31:54.540 --> 31:55.340]  Money's going out.
[31:55.380 --> 31:57.020]  It's contributing to the community.
[31:57.180 --> 31:58.060]  In Colorado,
[31:58.060 --> 31:59.620]  as far as everything else is concerned,
[32:00.020 --> 32:05.020]  our cannabis industry is just like our ice cream industry or our newspaper
[32:05.260 --> 32:07.020]  industry or our sneaker industry.
[32:07.540 --> 32:12.540]  It's exactly the same until it comes to how they handle payments in and payments
[32:13.420 --> 32:17.180]  out and what they do with the money after it shows up at the store.
[32:18.100 --> 32:19.340]  So if this does pass,
[32:19.340 --> 32:21.420]  is there a business model in mind?
[32:21.420 --> 32:25.220]  Are they going to follow the Colorado regulation and regulate like alcohol?
[32:25.260 --> 32:27.060]  Or do they have a different idea that you've read?
[32:27.060 --> 32:32.060]  So the federal legislation just removes the federal laws against it and allows
[32:33.060 --> 32:35.300]  states to do their own thing.
[32:35.300 --> 32:36.260]  Like they have with booze,
[32:36.260 --> 32:41.260]  like Mississippi can decide to be the Utah of weed and do state run stores,
[32:42.420 --> 32:44.020]  state run grows.
[32:44.540 --> 32:45.100]  Um,
[32:45.100 --> 32:47.220]  only the state profits from this.
[32:47.860 --> 32:51.860]  They dial down potency or put in purchase limits however they want.
[32:51.900 --> 32:56.260]  And other states can go full bore and say you can buy as much as you'd like.
[32:56.300 --> 33:00.460]  And I mean it lets each state kind of hammer it out for themselves for the most
[33:00.460 --> 33:01.260]  part,
[33:01.260 --> 33:02.740]  which is like we do with most stuff.
[33:04.500 --> 33:08.700]  The thing that got my attention is it's called the cannabis revenue act or the
[33:08.700 --> 33:10.340]  marijuana revenue act.
[33:10.500 --> 33:11.860]  Of course it's got money involved.
[33:13.540 --> 33:13.700]  Well,
[33:13.700 --> 33:14.860]  the feds are,
[33:15.620 --> 33:20.380]  they're starting to get pressure from lawmakers where like there's a,
[33:20.540 --> 33:21.180]  a,
[33:21.180 --> 33:25.380]  a rumor out in the world that I see on a lot of anti-pop forums and a lot of
[33:25.380 --> 33:28.460]  uninformed cannabis discussions where they say,
[33:29.460 --> 33:29.500]  um,
[33:29.500 --> 33:33.940]  the feds can't collect cannabis taxes or federal taxes from cannabis businesses
[33:33.940 --> 33:35.300]  because they're illegally federal,
[33:35.300 --> 33:36.220]  which is fucking nonsense.
[33:36.660 --> 33:38.660]  Illegal businesses still have to pay taxes.
[33:39.340 --> 33:40.180]  Um,
[33:41.180 --> 33:43.100]  if it's a full on criminal enterprise,
[33:43.100 --> 33:43.820]  they typically don't,
[33:43.820 --> 33:45.380]  which is how Al Capone got busted.
[33:45.420 --> 33:46.100]  Right.
[33:46.100 --> 33:51.100]  But that law was already on the books when Al Capone got busted and is still
[33:51.140 --> 33:52.220]  very much in play today.
[33:52.780 --> 33:53.420]  Um,
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.900]  that's where two 80 E comes in.
[33:54.900 --> 33:56.660]  It says if you run an illegal fucking business,
[33:56.660 --> 33:58.340]  you can't take federal tax deductions.
[33:58.900 --> 33:59.180]  Um,
[33:59.180 --> 34:00.540]  like any other business would.
[34:00.580 --> 34:05.580]  And that's why two 80 E is so impactful to the legal cannabis industry is it's
[34:05.820 --> 34:06.820]  legal in the state,
[34:06.820 --> 34:08.020]  but it's not illegal federally.
[34:08.020 --> 34:10.100]  So we get triple fucked on taxes.
[34:10.500 --> 34:11.340]  Triple.
[34:11.820 --> 34:13.700]  We pay almost 70% in taxes.
[34:14.140 --> 34:18.340]  It that's not after we've hit the $10 million mark.
[34:18.700 --> 34:22.420]  Clarify that because that sounds egregious and like hyperbole,
[34:22.420 --> 34:24.100]  but explain how that 70%,
[34:24.100 --> 34:26.140]  who is paying that 70% in taxes.
[34:26.140 --> 34:27.460]  So the business owner,
[34:27.460 --> 34:28.420]  the business itself,
[34:28.420 --> 34:29.420]  the business itself,
[34:29.460 --> 34:30.620]  it's coming out of the sales.
[34:30.940 --> 34:31.220]  Yeah.
[34:31.220 --> 34:32.700]  So for every dollar,
[34:33.540 --> 34:34.340]  um,
[34:34.340 --> 34:34.620]  okay.
[34:34.620 --> 34:36.020]  So to use real numbers,
[34:36.020 --> 34:37.140]  Colorado sold,
[34:37.620 --> 34:37.940]  um,
[34:37.940 --> 34:40.660]  just over a billion dollars worth of cannabis last year.
[34:41.260 --> 34:41.660]  Um,
[34:41.660 --> 34:43.300]  it's going to end up being like 1.4,
[34:43.300 --> 34:44.300]  but we're around to a billion.
[34:44.300 --> 34:46.380]  I can't visualize a billion dollars.
[34:46.540 --> 34:46.700]  Well,
[34:46.700 --> 34:51.700]  like 600 million of that or more 650 million of that was taxes.
[34:52.940 --> 34:53.780]  Go down.
[34:54.100 --> 34:54.940]  Yep.
[34:54.980 --> 34:55.660]  Um,
[34:55.660 --> 34:56.740]  the remainder,
[34:56.980 --> 34:59.020]  the 350 million leftover,
[34:59.620 --> 35:04.260]  that's what the industry used to keep the lights on to do payroll.
[35:04.660 --> 35:07.020]  It's what the owners profited is,
[35:07.100 --> 35:08.220]  is that leftovers.
[35:08.500 --> 35:13.180]  So the state takes 15% off the top for excise.
[35:13.420 --> 35:14.740]  When the cannabis is produced.
[35:14.780 --> 35:16.780]  So it's grown in one facility,
[35:17.540 --> 35:19.500]  then it's got to be taken to a retail location.
[35:19.500 --> 35:20.940]  Those are two separate entities,
[35:20.940 --> 35:21.940]  two separate environments.
[35:22.340 --> 35:23.660]  When it moves in the computer,
[35:23.980 --> 35:25.220]  15% taxes.
[35:25.380 --> 35:25.700]  Boom.
[35:25.700 --> 35:26.380]  Um,
[35:26.420 --> 35:27.420]  when,
[35:28.300 --> 35:28.540]  uh,
[35:28.540 --> 35:29.980]  15% for excise,
[35:30.340 --> 35:31.940]  there's a special cannabis tax.
[35:31.940 --> 35:33.180]  It's like 10%.
[35:33.580 --> 35:34.860]  There's a local sales tax.
[35:34.860 --> 35:35.900]  It's like 5%.
[35:36.300 --> 35:37.460]  Already we're at 30%.
[35:38.460 --> 35:38.660]  Yep.
[35:38.700 --> 35:39.380]  I'm writing it down.
[35:39.380 --> 35:39.980]  I'm keeping notes.
[35:40.100 --> 35:44.260]  There's a couple of different little small taxes that bring the state up to
[35:44.260 --> 35:46.820]  like 33 and a half percent or something like that.
[35:47.420 --> 35:47.660]  Um,
[35:47.660 --> 35:51.620]  depending on which part of the state you're standing in and then federal taxes
[35:51.980 --> 35:53.260]  that everybody pays,
[35:53.780 --> 35:54.460]  um,
[35:54.460 --> 35:56.100]  usually come in around 20,
[35:56.100 --> 36:01.060]  22% because cannabis businesses aren't allowed to deduct,
[36:01.740 --> 36:02.140]  um,
[36:02.140 --> 36:04.060]  payroll inventory,
[36:04.700 --> 36:05.380]  um,
[36:05.380 --> 36:07.620]  a number of other things that normal businesses deduct.
[36:07.620 --> 36:11.740]  Like normally if your business buys new chairs for the office that gets
[36:11.740 --> 36:12.260]  deducted,
[36:12.260 --> 36:12.820]  right?
[36:12.820 --> 36:15.620]  Not for cannabis businesses that can't take any deductions,
[36:15.940 --> 36:18.620]  which brings their federal tax to 32 or 33%.
[36:19.180 --> 36:19.540]  Um,
[36:19.540 --> 36:20.540]  in Pueblo County,
[36:20.540 --> 36:25.540]  most of the businesses are paying 67% in taxes is so for each dollar,
[36:26.100 --> 36:31.100]  they get 67% could take 67 cents gets taken out of that dollar and divvied up
[36:31.420 --> 36:32.260]  to go to taxes.
[36:33.380 --> 36:33.660]  Um,
[36:33.660 --> 36:37.580]  so the feds are collecting their share of this money and it's starting to
[36:37.820 --> 36:38.900]  be a lot of money.
[36:39.380 --> 36:40.220]  Um,
[36:40.660 --> 36:41.860]  coast to coast.
[36:41.980 --> 36:42.460]  Um,
[36:42.460 --> 36:46.100]  the estimates last year for legal cannabis sales were like seven or 10 billion,
[36:46.140 --> 36:47.100]  seven to 10 billion.
[36:47.940 --> 36:48.780]  Um,
[36:48.780 --> 36:50.100]  that's a lot of fucking money.
[36:50.860 --> 36:53.860]  And when the feds are taking 30% of that,
[36:54.500 --> 36:56.260]  eventually somebody is going to be like,
[36:57.260 --> 36:58.820]  but you call them drug dealers,
[36:59.580 --> 37:00.900]  you're taking your cut.
[37:02.060 --> 37:02.900]  Are you sure?
[37:02.900 --> 37:04.860]  That makes you part of the game.
[37:05.340 --> 37:06.100]  In my opinion,
[37:06.100 --> 37:06.940]  you're part of it.
[37:06.940 --> 37:07.300]  Yeah.
[37:07.340 --> 37:10.340]  And you're definitely at least condoning.
[37:10.420 --> 37:15.140]  If you came on my turf and you sold a hundred dollars worth of your drug of
[37:15.140 --> 37:16.260]  choice is just a hypothetical.
[37:16.260 --> 37:17.100]  I don't have any turf,
[37:17.100 --> 37:18.420]  so this is just a hypothetical.
[37:18.620 --> 37:21.620]  If you stepped on my turf and you sold a hundred dollars worth of product,
[37:21.620 --> 37:22.500]  I walked up to you and said,
[37:22.500 --> 37:23.180]  Hey,
[37:23.180 --> 37:25.460]  I'm going to beat the shit out of you and take all a hundred or you just want to
[37:25.460 --> 37:26.260]  give me 10 bucks.
[37:26.260 --> 37:27.540]  Every time you sell a hundred,
[37:27.860 --> 37:28.740]  you'd give me 10 bucks.
[37:28.780 --> 37:29.940]  I am now part of your crime,
[37:30.380 --> 37:30.620]  right?
[37:30.620 --> 37:31.460]  I'm taxing you.
[37:31.500 --> 37:31.820]  That is,
[37:31.820 --> 37:32.260]  I'm Ted.
[37:32.260 --> 37:33.140]  That is hood tax.
[37:33.260 --> 37:33.380]  Well,
[37:33.380 --> 37:33.580]  no,
[37:33.580 --> 37:35.140]  if the cops discovered this,
[37:35.140 --> 37:36.180]  you'd get in trouble too.
[37:36.180 --> 37:36.580]  Yep.
[37:36.580 --> 37:36.860]  Yep.
[37:36.860 --> 37:41.140]  And that's basically what the feds are doing is they're demanding legal cannabis
[37:41.140 --> 37:41.740]  businesses,
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.460]  not only pay federal taxes,
[37:43.780 --> 37:47.380]  but pay inflated federal taxes because of two 80 E.
[37:47.820 --> 37:49.380]  And at the same time they go,
[37:49.700 --> 37:52.180]  we appreciate you paying your taxes in a timely manner.
[37:52.540 --> 37:55.740]  We apologize for charging you an extra fee because you paid in cash.
[37:56.300 --> 37:58.660]  Also these DEA agents,
[37:58.660 --> 37:59.660]  if they ever get bored,
[37:59.900 --> 38:01.380]  they're going to come fuck your life up.
[38:01.420 --> 38:02.700]  They're going to take everything you've owned.
[38:02.740 --> 38:04.460]  They're going to break everything you've purchased.
[38:04.740 --> 38:06.140]  They're going to shoot your fucking dog.
[38:06.380 --> 38:08.100]  And then they're going to tell you it's your fault.
[38:08.340 --> 38:09.900]  Throw you in jail for six months.
[38:10.220 --> 38:11.260]  When all that's over,
[38:11.300 --> 38:14.780]  they're not going to get around to charging you because the prosecutor knows the
[38:14.780 --> 38:19.340]  jury in your area will be pissed that they were called for jury duty over a
[38:19.340 --> 38:21.500]  fucking weed store that the state said was legal.
[38:21.940 --> 38:24.140]  They've done this before in a couple of places.
[38:24.740 --> 38:25.540]  Um,
[38:25.540 --> 38:30.540]  and eventually that fucked up situation is going to come to a head.
[38:31.500 --> 38:32.740]  I think we're headed there now.
[38:33.300 --> 38:35.700]  You and I ran a dispensary.
[38:35.820 --> 38:36.660]  I'm pretty proud of it.
[38:36.660 --> 38:38.940]  We had the first dispensary in Pueblo that was,
[38:39.020 --> 38:39.340]  uh,
[38:39.340 --> 38:43.460]  other other folks and us ran the very first dispensary within city limits here
[38:43.460 --> 38:44.300]  in Pueblo.
[38:44.540 --> 38:44.700]  Uh,
[38:44.700 --> 38:48.020]  we paid a very large number in tax dollars,
[38:48.540 --> 38:49.380]  a large number,
[38:49.660 --> 38:50.500]  a small car,
[38:50.500 --> 38:51.180]  a good car,
[38:51.180 --> 38:51.860]  a deep more.
[38:51.860 --> 38:52.580]  We paid my,
[38:52.580 --> 38:55.820]  what my car's worth in taxes and one tax payment.
[38:56.020 --> 39:00.780]  There was a fun meeting at one point with the city where I brought that up a
[39:00.780 --> 39:03.340]  couple of times in a really snarky,
[39:03.340 --> 39:03.500]  Hey,
[39:03.500 --> 39:04.820]  fuck all you kind of way.
[39:04.820 --> 39:07.340]  I remember the person's name and I remember his response.
[39:07.340 --> 39:10.060]  The city councilman joked that,
[39:10.100 --> 39:10.260]  uh,
[39:10.260 --> 39:11.100]  the checks in the mail,
[39:11.100 --> 39:13.340]  they'll send that shit back in the city manager.
[39:13.620 --> 39:16.500]  If looks could kill rated Ray would have died.
[39:17.380 --> 39:18.540]  The city manager was like,
[39:18.540 --> 39:18.820]  no,
[39:18.820 --> 39:20.380]  I've fucking cashed and spent bitch.
[39:20.380 --> 39:21.580]  Don't tell him we'll send it back.
[39:21.860 --> 39:22.060]  Yeah.
[39:22.060 --> 39:23.020]  They never sent it back.
[39:23.260 --> 39:23.420]  Yeah.
[39:23.420 --> 39:23.980]  Well,
[39:23.980 --> 39:25.100]  they took that,
[39:25.140 --> 39:26.180]  what that car,
[39:26.300 --> 39:30.660]  that car worth of tax payment and less than a week later walked in with cease
[39:30.660 --> 39:31.500]  and desist letters.
[39:31.500 --> 39:32.780]  You can no longer do this.
[39:33.060 --> 39:33.380]  So yeah,
[39:33.380 --> 39:35.060]  they were happy to take that tax money.
[39:35.460 --> 39:35.740]  Yep.
[39:35.940 --> 39:36.220]  And then,
[39:36.220 --> 39:36.900]  then in the trial,
[39:36.900 --> 39:37.700]  just like Mike said,
[39:37.700 --> 39:37.980]  we're like,
[39:37.980 --> 39:38.140]  well,
[39:38.140 --> 39:39.260]  what about all the tax money?
[39:40.020 --> 39:40.540]  Yeah,
[39:40.540 --> 39:41.380]  right.
[39:41.620 --> 39:41.780]  Yeah.
[39:41.780 --> 39:42.460]  They don't care.
[39:42.500 --> 39:42.900]  Thank you.
[39:42.900 --> 39:44.260]  He got to play ball for a little while,
[39:44.300 --> 39:48.380]  but at a certain point there has to be movement.
[39:48.940 --> 39:52.820]  There's enough elected officials now that understand that the legal cannabis
[39:52.820 --> 39:56.100]  industry is far preferable to the black market.
[39:56.140 --> 40:00.700]  Even if you go ahead and believe all the crazy shit people say cannabis does,
[40:01.380 --> 40:02.900]  even if you buy into all of that,
[40:02.900 --> 40:07.820]  it's still more beneficial for society to have it sold in a storefront than it
[40:07.820 --> 40:08.700]  is on a street corner.
[40:08.740 --> 40:10.180]  We're going to consume cannabis.
[40:10.380 --> 40:14.580]  People want herb and it's something that we can produce at home or in all kinds
[40:14.580 --> 40:15.300]  of different places.
[40:15.300 --> 40:15.620]  But I mean,
[40:15.620 --> 40:16.780]  we can produce it ourselves.
[40:16.780 --> 40:18.220]  So it is going to be around.
[40:18.220 --> 40:19.340]  It is going to exist.
[40:19.620 --> 40:23.340]  Why not make a few bucks off of it and stop putting people in jail?
[40:23.340 --> 40:24.580]  It'll clean out some jail space.
[40:24.820 --> 40:25.660]  It'll free up some.
[40:25.700 --> 40:26.420]  Do you in Colorado,
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.180]  the numbers on like 6,000,
[40:28.220 --> 40:32.500]  6,500 people a year are not getting arrested for marijuana possession.
[40:32.900 --> 40:33.380]  The only,
[40:33.380 --> 40:34.100]  I've said this before,
[40:34.140 --> 40:37.740]  the only thing I ever did that was really illegal or criminal,
[40:37.740 --> 40:38.100]  I mean,
[40:38.100 --> 40:38.820]  when I was younger,
[40:38.820 --> 40:39.860]  I was a fucking shithead,
[40:39.860 --> 40:41.060]  but now that as I'm an adult,
[40:41.060 --> 40:43.100]  but like random teenage vandalism doesn't,
[40:43.220 --> 40:43.820]  you know what I mean?
[40:43.820 --> 40:43.940]  Now,
[40:43.940 --> 40:46.540]  the only thing I had to worry about was having cannabis.
[40:46.580 --> 40:48.340]  It was the only thing that I did as an adult.
[40:48.340 --> 40:49.940]  That's the only crime I break.
[40:49.980 --> 40:52.660]  Sometimes I would drive like a complete fucking asshole,
[40:52.660 --> 40:54.380]  but most of the time I just had cannabis.
[40:54.460 --> 40:55.780]  That's an early crime.
[40:55.780 --> 40:56.100]  I didn't,
[40:56.100 --> 40:56.460]  a fraction.
[40:56.460 --> 40:59.740]  I didn't do the two things at once because of the don't break Bono Mike white
[40:59.740 --> 41:00.300]  Mike's rules.
[41:00.300 --> 41:01.740]  Don't break two laws at one time.
[41:02.140 --> 41:02.380]  Uh,
[41:02.380 --> 41:07.380]  but now that I don't have to worry about having my personal bag of weed or my
[41:07.780 --> 41:09.300]  dabs or whatever with me,
[41:09.780 --> 41:10.300]  I'm,
[41:10.300 --> 41:12.220]  I feel so it's so chill.
[41:12.260 --> 41:12.820]  That's nice.
[41:12.820 --> 41:14.300]  It's the only thing I did that was illegal.
[41:14.300 --> 41:15.340]  I'm no longer a criminal.
[41:15.380 --> 41:16.780]  I am an upstanding citizen.
[41:16.780 --> 41:18.740]  I don't feel weird when I get pulled over,
[41:18.820 --> 41:20.460]  I rolled down the window and I smiled at the cop like,
[41:20.460 --> 41:20.580]  yeah,
[41:20.580 --> 41:21.700]  I was going real fast,
[41:21.700 --> 41:21.900]  huh?
[41:21.900 --> 41:22.740]  I'm sorry.
[41:22.820 --> 41:23.380]  Like instead of,
[41:23.380 --> 41:23.860]  Oh shit,
[41:23.860 --> 41:26.300]  is he going to fuck my life up for this little bit of weed in my bag?
[41:26.460 --> 41:29.860]  Am I going to go to jail for however many days because I got two grams of herb
[41:29.860 --> 41:31.420]  and a little one hitter in my backpack?
[41:31.780 --> 41:33.140]  Or a dirty pipe in the trunk.
[41:33.260 --> 41:33.860]  Now I've got,
[41:34.220 --> 41:34.740]  uh,
[41:34.740 --> 41:36.020]  in a safe area in the car.
[41:36.140 --> 41:37.300]  See my car doesn't have a trunk,
[41:37.340 --> 41:41.540]  so I've got to put my stuff in another container and then put that out of reach.
[41:41.740 --> 41:41.980]  Uh,
[41:41.980 --> 41:43.420]  as far as I can get it from me.
[41:43.420 --> 41:45.860]  So that is obvious that I'm not trying to consume that product,
[41:45.860 --> 41:47.100]  but I do carry,
[41:47.380 --> 41:48.700]  I got my dad rig in there.
[41:48.700 --> 41:49.300]  I got the torch,
[41:49.300 --> 41:50.100]  I got the carb cap.
[41:50.100 --> 41:52.220]  I got multiple fucking layers of concentrates.
[41:52.220 --> 41:55.500]  I keep it in a cooler with some ice packs in there so that my concentrates don't
[41:55.500 --> 41:55.980]  get funky.
[41:55.980 --> 41:56.820]  Also,
[41:56.820 --> 41:58.100]  then when you get to wherever you're going,
[41:58.580 --> 42:00.020]  the rig water's not all warm.
[42:00.020 --> 42:02.780]  You ever pulled out the rig in the summer and you go to take a dab and the
[42:02.780 --> 42:04.660]  water's just steamy and the rig's hot.
[42:05.180 --> 42:05.660]  Not with me,
[42:05.660 --> 42:05.900]  bro.
[42:05.900 --> 42:07.020]  My rig's been in the cooler.
[42:07.700 --> 42:08.260]  Oh yeah.
[42:08.260 --> 42:09.100]  Learned my lesson.
[42:09.420 --> 42:13.540]  My favorite is one day I had the email on and our boy sloppy came over and went
[42:13.540 --> 42:14.380]  to take a dab.
[42:15.060 --> 42:17.780]  It just evaporated the water and he hit a dry email.
[42:18.060 --> 42:18.500]  Dab.
[42:18.500 --> 42:18.940]  Oh,
[42:18.940 --> 42:19.380]  sorry,
[42:19.380 --> 42:19.700]  slop.
[42:19.700 --> 42:20.180]  I'm still,
[42:20.180 --> 42:21.340]  still sorry for that one brother.
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.700]  Wasn't that episode 100?
[42:22.820 --> 42:24.620]  There was a podcast happening when that happened.
[42:25.780 --> 42:29.180]  Like right before episode 100 or if that was on episode,
[42:29.180 --> 42:30.540]  it might've been a hundred or yeah,
[42:30.540 --> 42:30.860]  it had to be.
[42:30.860 --> 42:31.180]  Well,
[42:31.180 --> 42:32.540]  he was probably here for a hundred.
[42:32.540 --> 42:35.100]  That's when the garden of weed and crew crowd.
[42:35.100 --> 42:35.860]  And he was over here.
[42:35.860 --> 42:36.180]  Yeah.
[42:36.220 --> 42:39.220]  There's a secondary table sloppy and Joe,
[42:39.260 --> 42:40.740]  which was funny because sloppy Joe,
[42:40.780 --> 42:42.780]  we're sitting over there at the small secondary table.
[42:42.820 --> 42:43.060]  Yup.
[42:43.300 --> 42:43.580]  Yup.
[42:44.180 --> 42:44.980]  The shy kids.
[42:45.740 --> 42:46.900]  They like it when we ramble Mike,
[42:46.940 --> 42:47.980]  this was a great podcast.
[42:47.980 --> 42:49.260]  I'm glad I got you out of the house.
[42:49.660 --> 42:49.780]  Oh,
[42:49.780 --> 42:50.860]  I'm glad I got out of the house too.
[42:50.860 --> 42:51.540]  I needed it today.
[42:51.620 --> 42:52.020]  I was going to say,
[42:52.020 --> 42:53.380]  we seem to have shaken your mood.
[42:53.620 --> 42:53.900]  Yeah.
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.900]  I was having one of them days folks.
[42:56.740 --> 42:57.700]  They just call me Grover.
[42:57.700 --> 42:58.540]  This bowl's loaded up,
[42:58.540 --> 42:58.700]  bro.
[42:58.700 --> 42:59.820]  You can hit that whenever you want.
[43:00.020 --> 43:01.580]  I don't want to have another coughing fit.
[43:01.580 --> 43:02.740]  My lungs are so fried.
[43:03.300 --> 43:04.500]  I was real mean to him today.
[43:04.500 --> 43:05.020]  Listeners.
[43:05.500 --> 43:05.580]  Yeah.
[43:05.580 --> 43:06.620]  You smoke cigarettes also,
[43:06.620 --> 43:07.500]  which is terrible for you.
[43:07.580 --> 43:08.820]  The cigarettes are not helping,
[43:08.820 --> 43:09.180]  but the,
[43:09.700 --> 43:14.580]  the in and the out are in and out of wet and hot air to cold and dry air
[43:14.580 --> 43:16.340]  repeatedly is just killing my lungs.
[43:17.300 --> 43:17.980]  Sounds bad.
[43:18.100 --> 43:18.620]  It does.
[43:18.860 --> 43:20.740]  Sounds like a big mouth reference.
[43:21.900 --> 43:22.180]  All right,
[43:22.180 --> 43:22.380]  bro.
[43:22.620 --> 43:22.940]  Um,
[43:22.940 --> 43:23.100]  dude,
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.420]  thanks for the good report on,
[43:24.580 --> 43:24.900]  uh,
[43:24.900 --> 43:26.620]  S B four 20.
[43:26.620 --> 43:28.380]  Are there any things that I did not,
[43:28.420 --> 43:28.660]  uh,
[43:28.660 --> 43:29.460]  let you cover?
[43:29.860 --> 43:30.060]  No,
[43:30.060 --> 43:30.340]  that,
[43:30.340 --> 43:32.860]  that covers most of the federal federal action right now.
[43:33.340 --> 43:33.700]  Awesome.
[43:33.700 --> 43:34.300]  Um,
[43:35.980 --> 43:36.300]  yeah,
[43:36.340 --> 43:36.860]  listeners,
[43:36.860 --> 43:38.140]  let me know what you want me to rant about.
[43:38.220 --> 43:38.700]  Tweet me.
[43:38.740 --> 43:40.300]  It's at Nemo punk 15,
[43:40.300 --> 43:41.780]  or you can find me on Facebook.
[43:41.780 --> 43:44.740]  It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws at Facebook.
[43:45.420 --> 43:46.540]  You just killed my segue.
[43:46.580 --> 43:47.140]  I was going to say,
[43:47.140 --> 43:47.300]  well,
[43:47.300 --> 43:47.500]  Mike,
[43:47.500 --> 43:48.540]  thanks for coming on the show.
[43:48.540 --> 43:51.060]  Why don't you tell everybody how we can find you and,
[43:51.660 --> 43:52.020]  uh,
[43:52.020 --> 43:54.140]  and how you just jumped the gun and good job,
[43:54.140 --> 43:54.340]  bro.
[43:54.340 --> 43:54.740]  Good job.
[43:54.740 --> 43:55.940]  Thanks for coming on the show and doing that.
[43:55.980 --> 43:56.580]  That was pretty awesome.
[43:56.580 --> 43:57.540]  I know where we're headed.
[43:58.500 --> 43:58.580]  Hey,
[43:58.580 --> 43:59.100]  ladies and gentlemen,
[43:59.100 --> 44:00.220]  thanks for listening to the podcast.
[44:00.220 --> 44:03.180]  I hope you learned a lot about Senate bill four 20.
[44:03.180 --> 44:03.940]  I hope you're excited.
[44:03.940 --> 44:04.740]  I hope it happens.
[44:04.740 --> 44:06.580]  I hope we are able to have some,
[44:06.860 --> 44:07.300]  uh,
[44:07.380 --> 44:08.860]  national cannabis.
[44:08.940 --> 44:09.580]  That'd be awesome.
[44:09.940 --> 44:10.500]  Um,
[44:10.540 --> 44:11.060]  listeners,
[44:11.060 --> 44:14.820]  if you're looking for some way to help kick this can further down the road,
[44:14.820 --> 44:16.420]  you can email or,
[44:16.460 --> 44:17.260]  um,
[44:17.380 --> 44:21.900]  otherwise contact your elected representative and tell them to support federal
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.500]  action on cannabis reform.
[44:24.420 --> 44:24.740]  Do that.
[44:24.740 --> 44:27.220]  I wouldn't be super specific about S four 20 though.
[44:28.060 --> 44:28.300]  I,
[44:28.300 --> 44:29.380]  I I'm just,
[44:29.420 --> 44:32.020]  I've seen so many of these get submitted and go nowhere.
[44:32.140 --> 44:32.420]  Go.
[44:32.420 --> 44:32.540]  No.
[44:32.540 --> 44:32.860]  Okay.
[44:32.860 --> 44:33.140]  Well,
[44:33.140 --> 44:34.300]  hopefully this one goes somewhere.
[44:34.340 --> 44:34.860]  If not,
[44:34.900 --> 44:35.140]  uh,
[44:35.140 --> 44:37.940]  we at least talked about it a little bit here on the show and told people what's
[44:37.940 --> 44:38.380]  going on.
[44:38.380 --> 44:40.020]  Give people a little bit of info.
[44:40.060 --> 44:40.380]  Yeah.
[44:40.380 --> 44:41.140]  That's what we're here for.
