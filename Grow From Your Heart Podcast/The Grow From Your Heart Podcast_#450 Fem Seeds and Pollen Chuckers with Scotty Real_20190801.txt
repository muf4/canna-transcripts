[00:00.000 --> 00:05.380]  Hey, what's up podcast world? Welcome to a very special episode of the grow from your heart podcast
[00:05.380 --> 00:10.480]  I don't know what episode number this will be or if it will even have an episode number
[00:10.480 --> 00:17.840]  If you have been listening to my show for a while, you know that I am friends with another podcast known as the dude grows show
[00:17.840 --> 00:24.580]  I was recently invited by Scotty real of the dude grow show to go to his studio known as the bakery to record a podcast
[00:24.820 --> 00:29.300]  I feel like the podcast came out very well. We had a very good conversation
[00:29.300 --> 00:33.580]  We had a very good time and it was a very good episode. So with Scotty's permission
[00:33.580 --> 00:40.180]  I'm going to repost the episode of the dude grow show right here on the grow from your heart podcast feed so that all of my
[00:40.180 --> 00:46.900]  Friends and listeners can hear the podcast interview that I did with Scotty real if you're not already following the dude grow show
[00:46.980 --> 00:49.700]  Please give them a subscribe on YouTube or iTunes
[00:49.700 --> 00:55.540]  I highly recommend their YouTube channel because they put out very high quality video content
[00:55.860 --> 00:59.700]  Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls smokers and growers with no further ado
[00:59.820 --> 01:05.040]  Let's jump right into the dude grow show featuring Rasta Jeff of iRegenetics
[01:05.860 --> 01:10.340]  What is up? DGC Scotty real hanging out with one of my good friends Rasta Jeff
[01:10.940 --> 01:16.300]  iRegenetics came to visit for our trip. You're a badass brother. Thank you, brother. Thank you for having me. Thank you
[01:17.580 --> 01:20.420]  Yeah, man. Hell yeah, first off. Thanks a bunch man
[01:20.420 --> 01:27.220]  Everything we do you support and I called you up for the concentration celebration the 710 and you said I'm in there brother
[01:27.220 --> 01:31.780]  It was my honor to to help get it going. I was involved behind the scenes. That was an honor
[01:32.180 --> 01:37.700]  When you say you're gonna do something I want it to be a success. I feel no competition in podcasting. It's one community
[01:37.700 --> 01:41.180]  We're trying to do the same thing for everybody. We want everybody to grow the dank
[01:41.180 --> 01:47.180]  Absolutely want to legalize and we want everyone out there smoking the best. So I think we're a team. We're on the same team
[01:47.700 --> 01:51.940]  Nothing but love and respect for the DGC crew and the show so thank you
[01:51.940 --> 01:57.100]  I can't even imagine if somebody would just listen, you know, how burnt out they would get of just listening to me
[01:57.100 --> 01:59.100]  They would hate me or just me
[02:00.940 --> 02:06.100]  Varieties of spicy life. Oh, it's truth. Yeah, man go from your heart podcast freaking awesome show
[02:06.100 --> 02:10.780]  I do dig it, but dude, let's talk about Bri and let's just talk. Let's just hang man
[02:10.780 --> 02:16.180]  I mean, I'm coming anything and everything you want to talk about bro. Yeah, we've been telling pretty good friends lately, man
[02:16.180 --> 02:19.700]  So getting to know each other a bit more with definitely kindred spirits
[02:19.700 --> 02:24.020]  So I agree, but we got different skill sets brothers from other mothers. I love it
[02:24.020 --> 02:30.960]  I love it, but way different skill sets like remember I said, I want your nose because you you can actually smell absolutely terpene
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.060]  Yeah, a lot of people tell me that lately. They want my turf nose. That's awesome. That's awesome
[02:36.060 --> 02:41.340]  All right, so I wanted to ask you first off. I did want to start off with breeding because I have a feeling it relates to
[02:41.860 --> 02:43.540]  Your
[02:43.540 --> 02:45.820]  Sensories your sensory perceptions. Yes
[02:46.500 --> 02:51.020]  Yeah, what may first off if I'm just looking at breeders what makes a legit breeder?
[02:51.020 --> 02:57.080]  What what makes a legit breeder? Yeah, I may frustrate some people here. What do they call pollen chuckers?
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.020]  There are a lot of pollen. I call myself a pollen chucker just because I'm humble. Excuse that. Um a
[03:02.460 --> 03:06.420]  Legit breeder somebody with a goal somebody that when you start off breeding you have a goal
[03:06.740 --> 03:13.580]  Which not as which is not money right a goal which is to create a line that is improving something or maybe you're growing
[03:13.700 --> 03:18.340]  Strain a and strain B and you want the flavor of strain a and the vigor of strain B, right?
[03:18.340 --> 03:23.540]  You've got a goal not just put a bunch of elite cuts in a room and a male and sprinkle some pollen and then sell
[03:23.540 --> 03:29.420]  Those seeds sure. That's a pollen chucker. That's an asshole. That's somebody out for profits a breeder is somebody with a goal
[03:29.620 --> 03:31.900]  Then once those seeds are made you have to test them
[03:31.940 --> 03:36.060]  You can't just make seeds and put them out and sorry about the throat clearing. We got dabbed out
[03:36.980 --> 03:42.140]  By the way, right as well. I was asking you about he's got the rig and the torch and everything
[03:42.300 --> 03:44.660]  I'm like, come on man. Just hit an email
[03:44.660 --> 03:49.780]  It's so fucking easy and we all hit a dab and each one of us one dab and we're stoned
[03:49.780 --> 03:53.620]  Yeah, the whole room is a little lit. It was nice, but it is different
[03:53.620 --> 03:57.620]  I you know even smoking out of a pen or even those little cartridge pens
[03:57.700 --> 04:02.540]  You just don't get a stone this way to just take a fucking full-on torch dad and I agree
[04:02.540 --> 04:07.500]  That's why I've got that rig with me almost all the time. Yeah, and now that's travel peace and that's cold start
[04:07.500 --> 04:10.300]  Is that we want it's an insert dab. I call it an insert
[04:10.300 --> 04:11.420]  I've heard it called a few other things
[04:11.420 --> 04:13.220]  but right I put the dab in a
[04:13.220 --> 04:18.220]  Basically a glass thimble and then heat the banger and then drop the thimble into the banger and cap it, right?
[04:18.220 --> 04:21.780]  It works kind of like a double boiler instead of my dad hitting hot glass
[04:21.780 --> 04:28.000]  It gets to heat up slowly and so I get it as it comes to temperature and sure scolding hot dabs directly to the lungs
[04:28.140 --> 04:32.260]  They're still warm. I like I'm kind of hot but right just come it bubbles up
[04:32.260 --> 04:35.580]  You can watch the dab bubble and it comes to temperature instead of just instantly
[04:36.420 --> 04:41.180]  Yeah, I seen it was awesome. It's freaking water. It feels better. You get a lot of draws off one good dab
[04:41.380 --> 04:43.380]  Yeah, really nice. I love it
[04:43.900 --> 04:47.060]  Everybody in the room is baked. You enjoyed it. You got me going
[04:47.060 --> 04:51.020]  So we're just gonna bullshit a little bit man really good at that since we've declared we're all baked
[04:51.020 --> 04:53.020]  We're just gonna bullshit a little bit. We're good at that
[04:53.540 --> 04:59.300]  So dude, first off I want to know I read genetics ever since I've been you know in the DGC
[04:59.300 --> 05:00.820]  I've always known you guys existed
[05:01.540 --> 05:05.380]  You guys are when you go pro I'm gonna ask I didn't know we did
[05:07.860 --> 05:13.380]  It just seemed to kind of I took I just followed the steps that I seen were supposed to happen in life as a
[05:13.380 --> 05:19.620]  Rower is a breeder at all just kept coming to me naturally and I would see opportunities and some I had to decline and some
[05:19.620 --> 05:25.820]  I knew were right and one day I was here doing this. I don't know that this was the exact intention
[05:26.260 --> 05:28.740]  You can tell what I obviously believe in the colors I wear
[05:29.460 --> 05:30.860]  That had a lot to do with it
[05:30.860 --> 05:33.900]  I just listened to the steps from above and followed the path
[05:33.900 --> 05:37.640]  It was laid in front of me and I think I'm right where I'm supposed to be and the skill set
[05:37.640 --> 05:39.640]  Where'd you get the skills?
[05:39.660 --> 05:42.700]  Most of that I think comes from passion. I love cannabis
[05:42.700 --> 05:47.700]  I've got crazy ADD and when I smoke that seems to stop there are
[05:48.460 --> 05:53.500]  7,000 thoughts happening in this crazy brain of mine. I want to when I smoke I can hear five of them really clearly
[05:53.860 --> 05:59.300]  It's so advantageous for my life. It just makes all that background chatter stop and then I can function
[06:00.620 --> 06:03.980]  Excuse me again. So then I started smoking a lot, right?
[06:03.980 --> 06:07.100]  And then I think like most of us I got tired of paying for it
[06:07.100 --> 06:11.500]  So I wanted to grow my own and then I wasn't satisfied with the clones and the seeds I was getting
[06:11.700 --> 06:14.640]  So I started making my own stuff and then how long it was this
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.660]  Probably before I should admit
[06:17.660 --> 06:20.500]  There weren't legal cannabis laws when I first got into it
[06:20.500 --> 06:25.220]  But as soon as we were able to get more rooms and more space I was up and breeding and doing it nice
[06:25.780 --> 06:30.960]  2008 2009. Okay. Hello. Yeah before that in other states and you were breeding though
[06:30.960 --> 06:35.700]  You had the foresight to bro. I was just super psyched to be able to find a cut back in 2000
[06:35.700 --> 06:39.020]  Yeah, thousand nine. I was lucky to be I had some good friends who were ahead of the game
[06:39.020 --> 06:44.740]  I had some friends who came from California right from North Carolina who were going on the hills for years and years
[06:44.740 --> 06:46.500]  I had friends with Oakster dam
[06:46.500 --> 06:50.580]  University teachings who brought cuts from Oakster dam that I got a hold of
[06:50.740 --> 06:53.900]  So I just fell into the right circles. I feel like I was really blessed
[06:53.900 --> 06:54.540]  That's what I see
[06:54.540 --> 06:56.940]  I just followed the steps that were laid in front of me and right
[06:57.100 --> 07:01.500]  Whatever I believe in put me right where I needed to be. Yeah, that's it's interesting
[07:02.060 --> 07:04.580]  Okay, so that's how that makes you pro
[07:04.580 --> 07:08.820]  It makes you pro because you've been doing it first off for so long and then you've got such a good reputation
[07:09.020 --> 07:14.740]  No, I appreciate that. Oh, yeah. I mean it's a fact but so what do you say to all I see all these people?
[07:14.740 --> 07:19.140]  I get people handing me packs of seeds all the time and I don't know what to say
[07:19.140 --> 07:23.340]  I don't know what to think about them. And you know, what what I mean? I don't know. What do you think about?
[07:24.140 --> 07:28.780]  When who would call yours when you would call yourself professional if you're a young breeder? Oh
[07:29.420 --> 07:31.420]  That's uh, I guess that's up to you
[07:31.860 --> 07:36.420]  When you're when your seeds when you know that everybody growing your seeds is not having a problem, right?
[07:36.420 --> 07:41.540]  It's a big sign people are reporting hermaphrodites if they're complaining right not professional
[07:42.060 --> 07:49.180]  Yeah, I just see it's such a trendy business and I see people always trying to just throw something and throw something out there and
[07:49.180 --> 07:50.140]  that's
[07:50.140 --> 07:53.860]  That's hype. That's instant success. But also you don't see those people around
[07:54.380 --> 07:56.380]  I'm right here for a little while when
[07:56.380 --> 07:58.100]  When I was trying to get on seeds here now
[07:58.100 --> 08:01.340]  He said one of the things that brought him me to his attention, right?
[08:01.340 --> 08:05.180]  I've been around for a while and he said I've seen you you haven't been here for just two weeks
[08:05.180 --> 08:10.580]  You're out of these new pollen chuckers. Yeah, that makes a difference. Those guys just throw on pollen on hype strains
[08:10.580 --> 08:16.060]  They won't be here for two or three harvest. You'll see a bunch of herms come from them people complain. They'll disappear
[08:16.060 --> 08:21.580]  But you do here I mean there's guys who was the Bubba guy the there's an alien guy rather shoot
[08:21.580 --> 08:26.660]  We just gave away some of the seeds last week. I know his name and it's killing me. It's a it's a funny name
[08:26.660 --> 08:32.340]  But anyway, so he's known for something specific right? He's known for that alien. Yeah. Yeah
[08:32.340 --> 08:35.220]  So you're known for arise. Is that what you would say?
[08:35.220 --> 08:41.540]  Arise would be my high potency regular line. That's not available in fans. Okay line. That's popular would be the lemon Jeffrey
[08:41.540 --> 08:45.020]  That's so I've got a regular and a feminized line a rise in lemon Jeff. Yeah
[08:45.860 --> 08:49.500]  Okay, so we're talking and first off. I want to get into feminized a little bit
[08:49.580 --> 08:53.220]  We'll hold that for one second because I'm just thinking about being a breeder
[08:53.820 --> 08:58.220]  And I'm actually I was laughing because it seems like it's a license to print money
[08:58.220 --> 08:59.740]  You're like, dude, you just you know
[08:59.740 --> 09:05.580]  Put pollen on there you come back and you got hundreds of seeds and you sell them for five packs for a hundred bucks or whatever
[09:05.940 --> 09:11.540]  But it's not like I was talking to James being our friend James being seeds here now huge supporter
[09:11.540 --> 09:13.540]  You can go get your seeds over there. Please do
[09:13.580 --> 09:21.300]  Yeah, but I was talking about just so many obstacles just about trying to do business how much discrimination there is out there, right?
[09:21.300 --> 09:27.240]  Oh you even it's CBD you say the word CBD and you get discriminated against on your Facebook shut down your Instagram
[09:27.240 --> 09:29.660]  Yeah, it causes problems quickly. Yeah, man
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.240]  What would you say man if we're looking at obstacles obstacles about being in this business?
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.680]  So what would some unforeseen things your social media is gonna be a struggle?
[09:39.680 --> 09:41.920]  A lot of people think they're gonna advertise on social media
[09:41.920 --> 09:46.880]  My social media gets taken away all of my friends social media if you post pictures of plants if you say the wrong stuff
[09:47.560 --> 09:51.800]  Social media goes the YouTube channels our friend Colin. His video is gone from your feed
[09:51.800 --> 09:54.540]  Yeah, and what's that some one hater one?
[09:55.300 --> 10:00.780]  Thing yeah, that's all it takes. I think it is all it takes man. So just simple things like that the social media
[10:00.780 --> 10:05.540]  We take that for granted I come from an era when we didn't really have that right like when I started doing this
[10:05.540 --> 10:07.100]  We weren't supposed to be doing this
[10:07.100 --> 10:12.020]  So for me just to be able to post my pictures feels kind of it feels like it's a special thing
[10:12.020 --> 10:17.140]  So I feel yeah, I understand what people say. They're lurkers. They're like I've been lurking for a while. That was me
[10:17.820 --> 10:19.820]  Florida
[10:19.980 --> 10:23.500]  Here's my weed I'm proud yeah, I'm disguising my IP address before I
[10:24.020 --> 10:26.380]  Overgrow, yeah, I've got my face and my giant buds
[10:27.660 --> 10:33.100]  Where you can buy it and we've got it all I love it that I feel like we're really taking that for granted now
[10:33.100 --> 10:37.000]  We feel that's really a huge privilege. I didn't have that back when I was starting this
[10:37.860 --> 10:38.980]  obstacles
[10:38.980 --> 10:42.620]  As a seed breeder you there's a lot of work to it. You've got to become relevant
[10:42.620 --> 10:44.820]  You said people it's a license to print money sure
[10:44.820 --> 10:51.060]  But that money is a lottery or monopoly money until you've established that your seeds are worth something. Oh, that's true
[10:51.060 --> 10:55.860]  No offense to you or the guys in this room, but if we made warehouse Kyle seeds, they're not gonna go anywhere
[10:55.900 --> 10:59.580]  What if we put his picture on the back maybe if that picture with no shirt?
[11:00.940 --> 11:04.860]  Maybe but the ladies will buy a few packs and then it'll stop moving
[11:04.860 --> 11:07.860]  No, but I understand it is there's a lot of work a lot of
[11:08.820 --> 11:14.500]  You have to be vetted by the community a lot of people have to grow it right and if somebody doesn't like you in the
[11:14.500 --> 11:19.500]  Cannabis industry or community that spreads more quickly than a good reputation. Oh, you ain't kidding
[11:19.500 --> 11:24.300]  You've got a thousand likes and one thumbs down and everyone goes what's with the thumbs down? Why that pisses me off?
[11:24.300 --> 11:31.100]  I do that myself. There's a hundred nice comments about something and one person being like, oh, you know, whatever a negative
[11:31.100 --> 11:35.940]  I don't like why did he think that I'm sitting there at the you know, the baseball game and like why did he think that?
[11:35.940 --> 11:39.980]  I wonder why doesn't everybody like what I say if everybody likes you it's fake
[11:39.980 --> 11:45.340]  One person has to not like you. Yes something right because if somebody doesn't like it
[11:45.340 --> 11:47.340]  You're pissing someone off and that's you should be
[11:47.500 --> 11:50.540]  If everybody likes it, you're fake. It's kind of like one of those
[11:50.540 --> 11:53.740]  I tell my kid a product for everyone is a product for no. Yep
[11:53.740 --> 11:59.900]  Yes, absolutely dial it in get your target and if you don't like me, that's okay. Somebody you do like it. Absolutely
[11:59.900 --> 12:01.900]  Yes, it absolutely is
[12:02.100 --> 12:08.020]  So getting back to breeding if I'm because I'm just thinking about how I've talked to like a bunch of breeders and everybody wants to
[12:08.020 --> 12:13.500]  Get into the game and I was thinking about how long it would just how long it takes to figure out even if something's working
[12:13.820 --> 12:20.440]  Yeah, you got a cross that you did a rise by Mac maybe okay, which seems to be on your mind
[12:20.440 --> 12:26.620]  That's happening. Geez, you're a psychic. Oh, did I blow it? No, I'm gonna make myself some arise to Max ease
[12:26.620 --> 12:30.980]  We'll see what happens right now. That's exactly what you'll see. We'll see what happens. See what happens
[12:31.020 --> 12:36.140]  Does it take to see what happens? What kind of investment? We've got to veg, but we've got to cut clones
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.440]  You have to cut in a rise male. That's King Solomon. You got to get a Mac clone
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.480]  So you're cutting those you got right what 14 days in your cloning machine 10 14 days
[12:44.060 --> 12:46.100]  Then you've got to put those in small pots
[12:46.100 --> 12:48.040]  You got probably two or three weeks there, right?
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.340]  Can I go into a three gallon pot for four or maybe six weeks there? We're already at about ten weeks, right?
[12:53.700 --> 12:57.040]  We've got soil. We've got lights. We share water already now
[12:57.040 --> 13:04.360]  I'm gonna flower about around day 18 to 25 all pollinate then I've got another 40 or 50 days before those seeds are done
[13:04.660 --> 13:09.360]  Then we harvest plants dry. That's like the half-life now. Yeah now I've got seeds
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.440]  Now I've got to grow the seeds to find out if what I've created is worth a shit because it could be
[13:14.600 --> 13:17.340]  It could be amazing. It could be a total dud
[13:17.340 --> 13:21.500]  I don't know because I've never played with the Mac before sure. I know what Solomon does
[13:21.500 --> 13:22.120]  He's reliable
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.720]  But I don't know what that Mac girl how she's gonna react to that pollen and what those genes are gonna do together
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.560]  It could make a bunch of lopsided handicapped plants for all I know and so I know
[13:31.880 --> 13:34.880]  Okay, and what's the deal you were talking about reputation earlier?
[13:35.400 --> 13:37.800]  Herms are the worst thing you can do for your reputation
[13:37.840 --> 13:38.340]  Yes
[13:38.340 --> 13:40.360]  If I were to release her mafer diet seeds
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.120]  I would destroy all of this that I've built up right stop all of the everything and done
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.640]  So when you're crossing with things, you don't really know
[13:47.680 --> 13:53.960]  We're just kind of looking for the best here the way that I do my best to prevent that is to not use her mafer did
[13:53.960 --> 13:55.920]  A parent plants if so, that's what it is
[13:55.920 --> 14:00.460]  Plants that you're using have a tendency to herm do not breed with them because that will come out down the line
[14:00.460 --> 14:06.080]  Yeah, maybe not a whole bunch, but it will show up and if it shows up then it's a problem that has to happen
[14:06.080 --> 14:09.120]  So I've got to grow those seeds that I make you're right myself or send them out
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.800]  So I've got a lot of good friends who are reliable testers. They get them and they know hey, this is brand new
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.360]  You try this you take pictures look out for problems, right?
[14:17.360 --> 14:21.600]  It could be it could be a ticking time bomb in your grow. So just pay attention for this
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.440]  It could be a her mafer diet. It could be totally weird or it could be the new Mac. You never know. Got it
[14:26.440 --> 14:27.600]  Yeah, you have to give them a warning
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.720]  But they grow that for me or I grow them and then we make sure then if it's successful
[14:31.720 --> 14:32.960]  Then I give it to James Bean
[14:32.960 --> 14:33.440]  Sure
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.880]  Let's it out as a tester or as a freebie to other people and then they grow it also and say I got free stuff
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.200]  Then we see that it works well in a lot of right garden feed that hydro cocoa
[14:42.640 --> 14:44.640]  Soilless organics LEDs
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.800]  Whatever kind of lighting you could think of I want all the results and then we'll put it out for the public. Sure
[14:49.800 --> 14:55.200]  Yeah, all right. That makes sense. It makes okay. Now here's one. I'm trying to I've had this explained to me before
[14:55.720 --> 15:01.200]  You're you're a good good. You're actually a podcaster. You could probably explain this to me in a very simple way
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.760]  Femme seeds feminized seeds. There's all sorts of you know, the Internet's full of bullshit
[15:07.200 --> 15:12.480]  Femme seeds will harm on you, you know that kind of stuff. Would you explain feminized seed?
[15:12.480 --> 15:19.120]  I think it's fairly simple if like I said a minute ago if you use her mafra didic parents you get her mafra didic offspring
[15:19.120 --> 15:24.120]  Okay, if the femme seeds are made with her mafra diet girls, they will be her mafra diets
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.960]  The way that I make them is I carefully select my girls. I stress test the females that I use
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.800]  so if I'm gonna use a strawberry fields girl and a
[15:32.400 --> 15:35.400]  Golden goat will just say cuz I'm popular for using the golden goat and reversing it
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.840]  Sure, I put those in a room and I'll run them on 1212 like we normally do but about two weeks in I'll go and
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.840]  Change the light cycle
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.560]  You know, I want to see it right they do under stress and if they her mafra diet, they don't get to breed
[15:47.560 --> 15:50.000]  They get taken out of the breeding schedule. They're gone
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.100]  No writers if they show me that they're worthy then I'll work with them and that's where we'll get to the feminized talk
[15:55.100 --> 16:00.360]  So I'll take the golden goat plant and I make a product called silver thiosulfate
[16:00.400 --> 16:04.000]  It's really easy to figure out how to make that. I don't teach a lot about how to make that
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.720]  I don't want to get too detailed. I just want to take that product
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.480]  I spray that product on the plant right turns the plant
[16:09.480 --> 16:16.240]  It's makes pollen sacks that contain pollen that only have female chromosomes. There's no male chromosomes in that plant
[16:16.240 --> 16:23.120]  Wow, but I have just tricked that plant a blocker or something. Basically. Yeah, it's the silver stops the copper movement
[16:23.120 --> 16:26.040]  Which creates other things so it's a blocker. Yes
[16:26.040 --> 16:28.040]  You get me to understand
[16:28.280 --> 16:32.560]  One step at a time. All right, so we stop the copper movement
[16:32.560 --> 16:36.400]  We create other hormones from moving then we create pollen sacks with
[16:36.960 --> 16:42.260]  Female pollen then I put that female pollen on a female plant now, there's no opportunity for male
[16:42.260 --> 16:47.840]  It's all female chromosomes happening, right if I have chosen my parents correctly, and I'm quite careful to do it
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.960]  I don't get any reports of her mafra diets in my seeds. That's huge. Yes. That's why you got a good reputation
[16:53.480 --> 16:58.280]  That's why the Rose there are a lot of them out there now a lot of lemon Jeffries a lot of golden, right?
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.040]  They're out right and first up. What do you do? I mean, I guess you haven't have you ever had it cuz I mean
[17:03.040 --> 17:06.840]  What the hell do you do? That's like a fire erupting right there. Well, I get rid of them. I
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.200]  Chop them down. Yeah, if I've had it in the room and I see her mafra died
[17:11.200 --> 17:15.200]  I remember what the parents are I take good notes right when it goes I don't continue that anymore
[17:15.360 --> 17:19.160]  There's no need for that. We've got so many opportunities for good genetics
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.320]  Want to play with anything that isn't a tip we've got elevens now we used to scale things on a one to ten
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.840]  We found a lemon. Why do you want to mess with a seven or six?
[17:27.840 --> 17:30.040]  I seen that Mac and I was like, oh, yeah
[17:30.040 --> 17:35.840]  Yeah, and so let's play with the nines and tens and elevens and leave the her mafra did X sixes and fives out of it
[17:35.840 --> 17:39.720]  It's gonna agree with you. Okay, so just as we're gonna leave this subject
[17:40.520 --> 17:43.760]  Feminized seed has nothing to do with her mafra diets, correct?
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.080]  Mafra does have to do with her mafra did it?
[17:46.400 --> 17:53.920]  Parents them seeds are just blocking was blocking some kind of male hormone or something like that only allowing female seeds to grow
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.560]  That's the best explanation. I've heard you give a fem so far. You've got it. All right, maybe I'm getting it man gold
[18:01.040 --> 18:07.560]  Excellent, man. How long you been doing femme seeds? I have been do I released femmes at one of the first cannabis cups?
[18:07.560 --> 18:12.000]  We had here in Colorado. I think it was 2010. Okay, very wrong
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.240]  All right. I've got a brain injury that makes dates really fuzzy for me. No, I was giving away
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.160]  Yeah, I was giving away grateful dog and heart of gold seeds
[18:19.160 --> 18:22.680]  I gave away probably ten thousand seeds at a couple of cannabis cups
[18:22.680 --> 18:24.880]  Just walking around giving them away five seeds at a time
[18:24.880 --> 18:29.920]  Oh if you were sharing like if you had a bag with those nutrients and I saw like he's gonna grow here free seed
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.340]  That's so cool. Is that way you could go home and you had everything that's so cool. Yeah
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.680]  Dude, so if I'll let you take your drink, but uh, so what's going on?
[18:37.760 --> 18:44.000]  Tell me what's first off we're bullshitting about following the trends. I mean my buddy Jaron comes over
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.080]  He gave me them and I can't say Jaron didn't do anything
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.200]  Gave me the wedding cake gave me some beautiful cuts the Mac came from Jaron
[18:52.200 --> 18:55.620]  That's proper because you're supposed to give it to people that we trust and respect
[18:55.620 --> 18:59.720]  Oh, so the Mac came from Jaron to you. That is a worthy gift Wow
[18:59.920 --> 19:04.420]  Respects you and he knows you're gonna do well with it. So it means a lot. I think you should brag that means a lot
[19:04.420 --> 19:08.300]  Alright, and I change it. Thank you. Jaron. I appreciate your brother, but
[19:09.300 --> 19:15.300]  Shit now you got me thinking just about the Mac cut. Hang on. What are we thinking about trends? Oh, yeah
[19:15.300 --> 19:19.020]  Yeah, right back. You're pretty good man podcaster brain
[19:21.300 --> 19:25.200]  But trends man, so you know the Mac cut super trendy
[19:25.620 --> 19:30.120]  Okay, Jaron comes over to give me that and he goes Oh chase the wedding cake smell it
[19:30.120 --> 19:35.320]  He goes you really get to vanilla frosting, don't you and I'm like, it smells like weed
[19:35.320 --> 19:40.400]  I mean, but and he's telling me goes all fuels are out now sweets are in. Yes
[19:40.400 --> 19:42.800]  How the fuck do you keep up with that shit, man?
[19:42.800 --> 19:48.300]  I love to smoke that hypey stuff, but I don't follow it in my growing or breeding. I avoid it
[19:48.300 --> 19:52.000]  That's not uh, I don't look like the most trendy guy. I'm pretty sure
[19:52.720 --> 19:57.920]  Well nowadays, yeah, but these were way before most people's if I let him down you'll see I was first
[19:58.560 --> 20:03.280]  You wait long enough, yeah, yeah, but I stay away from a lot of the trends a lot of the hype stuff
[20:03.280 --> 20:07.000]  I do my thing what feels right to me when I see a girl plant and a male plant, right?
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.100]  It's like when you see a girl at the bar and your friend like hey, dude
[20:10.100 --> 20:14.760]  You and her should talk you guys would all right, you know who should and I'm like that with plants
[20:14.760 --> 20:19.980]  I'm like this the plant matchmaker the plant porn producer. That's funny who would make a good scene
[20:19.980 --> 20:25.160]  I do think of that frequently like think of the Mac cut as like this beautiful girl
[20:25.480 --> 20:29.640]  With just a whole shitload of baggage with her, you know, I mean she grows slow
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.640]  She blah blah, you know what? I mean, but I'll still probably hang out with her for a little bit
[20:36.880 --> 20:42.040]  Yeah, yeah, I'll bet you just stay away from the hype I just I dodged the trends and right see me
[20:42.040 --> 20:45.880]  I'm obviously I'm pollinating the Mac. So that's that just sounds fun
[20:45.880 --> 20:50.200]  I want to see what it does sure, but I don't have wedding cake and all that other stuff, right?
[20:50.200 --> 20:54.960]  You don't see a lot of that stuff in my grow. I do what I like and so tell me come on
[20:54.960 --> 21:00.320]  Let's show off what you got man. Lemon. Jeffrey's a legend today. I brought some lemon Jeffrey
[21:00.320 --> 21:03.180]  Which camera am I gonna be on right here? I got a Jeff feminized seeds
[21:03.180 --> 21:07.960]  This is a the lemon skunk and golden goat. So give me come on. You're the best guy to describe this shit
[21:07.960 --> 21:09.280]  Come on, paint me a picture man
[21:09.280 --> 21:13.740]  So if you took a box of lemon head candies, okay, I poured those on the table and smelled the box
[21:13.740 --> 21:20.300]  It's not real overwhelmingly powerful right but like soft lemon kind of a dryer sheet and lemon sort of a thing
[21:20.300 --> 21:22.440]  that's the aroma I think comes from here sort of a
[21:23.100 --> 21:25.100]  dish soap right flavor
[21:25.180 --> 21:29.820]  Real big giant buds on this one. It's not super tight on some phenotypes
[21:29.820 --> 21:34.420]  Some of them are a little airier that comes from the lemon skin, right? I think that makes amazing concentrates
[21:34.420 --> 21:39.700]  That's what I was gonna ask you constant how many people just try comb farmers these days because then the parameters don't change
[21:40.620 --> 21:46.620]  Sifting and squishing right thing now, so they care about pretty buds or they care about yield. Well, you got to post those pretty buds
[21:47.140 --> 21:51.780]  Come on, that's what social media is all about until they shut us down and then you go to cannabis
[21:51.780 --> 21:55.460]  That's what you're supposed to do respect respect to our friends over there. Yeah, I love it
[21:55.460 --> 22:00.180]  It's a cannabis but yeah, they're all about the giant buds still that's that's gonna be a thing for a while
[22:00.180 --> 22:05.860]  Yeah, most people you're right are squishing and pressing and running it somehow. It's either diamonds or squish, right?
[22:06.020 --> 22:11.940]  I was at a show yesterday. That should have come smelled completely like weed. It was Beck, you know
[22:11.940 --> 22:15.060]  Yes, I mean and you know, you can smell it every now and again
[22:15.860 --> 22:20.420]  Everybody was smoking but they're hitting on pens and you know, I mean it was so low
[22:20.620 --> 22:26.380]  Pronouns most of the market is pens. Yeah, it's crazy. It's so discreet. I mean you don't smell
[22:26.380 --> 22:32.340]  Yeah, and if there are kids around they don't know if you're smoking nicotine or if that's a dad pen and security guards that got
[22:32.340 --> 22:35.500]  That and they let you in because they thought that was your nicotine. Yeah, I handed it
[22:35.700 --> 22:38.140]  Security guard. Yeah. Yeah, and like here you go. Have fun
[22:38.140 --> 22:42.940]  Yeah, actually I brought two because it you know, it was like a three-hour concert. Well, yeah, and if they took one then he had another
[22:43.900 --> 22:45.900]  You took both you blew my plan
[22:46.180 --> 22:50.280]  And you gotta have one in this pocket and one in this pocket and when they pay here you go. That's my pen
[22:50.280 --> 22:53.220]  I'm sorry, and then you just walk right? It is a weird world man
[22:53.220 --> 22:56.020]  There's places I go and they're like no you have to bring a clear backpack
[22:56.100 --> 23:00.180]  If you want to come in and I'm just like that's the future that's happening
[23:00.180 --> 23:03.380]  You know have some dreadlocks and look like me go to the concert. They get the gloves
[23:03.540 --> 23:08.220]  I love aquaponics. The potent panic Steve is always like it's weird. I get searched at the airport
[23:10.780 --> 23:15.060]  He's fun to hang out with eyes another friend I made through this show that I'm absolutely super pretty
[23:15.060 --> 23:19.540]  He's a friend that I made through your show. So I'm appreciative of the DGC crew. Love it. Love it
[23:19.540 --> 23:23.060]  All right. Come on. I've also got the orange gas. I'm orange guys. I'm is kind of new
[23:23.060 --> 23:28.740]  I talked about the lemon Jeffrey being super lemon turps, right? Guess what orange turps we got straight up oranges tangerines
[23:28.740 --> 23:32.740]  You know, I was reading the turp book. I'm trying to study up on turps
[23:32.740 --> 23:37.100]  I can't smell them, but at least I can bullshit about a carofeline. Thank you
[23:37.860 --> 23:44.040]  Carofeline funny. I tried to send it in a text. That's not no you did it was good. What is it?
[23:44.040 --> 23:48.140]  I don't remember how I typed it. I said it was good type it out thinking beta
[23:48.780 --> 23:52.400]  Ra those are yeah me and Steve are sitting there trying to correct each other, right?
[23:52.400 --> 23:56.340]  Do you stone or something? I'm probably saying wrong also. No, it's cool though
[23:56.340 --> 24:01.260]  But what I was gonna say is there's one that's a Valencia or something like that and there's a Valencia orange
[24:01.260 --> 24:04.280]  Yeah, so there is an orange terpene. I remember I would drive by the
[24:05.060 --> 24:11.780]  citrus squeeze plants in Florida and they would have big barrels of orange juice and then it would have a little tiny barrel of
[24:11.780 --> 24:13.780]  something like a 25
[24:14.020 --> 24:18.900]  25 gallon barrel it was always so different a hundred bucks hundred bucks as those are the terpenes, right?
[24:18.900 --> 24:22.700]  Oh, yeah, and all those aren't man. They got a little bit of turpene
[24:22.820 --> 24:25.820]  You probably make cleaner and all kinds of crazy stuff out of that
[24:25.820 --> 24:29.820]  I want or I wonder if they sell it for stuff or ozium. Yeah, you're right
[24:29.820 --> 24:33.220]  Yeah, I think this smells like the orange ozium if you get the orange one, right?
[24:33.220 --> 24:36.940]  It smells like the orange ozium is what I think this we shout out to that was one of the best
[24:36.940 --> 24:38.940]  I mean they saved my ass so many
[24:39.380 --> 24:43.860]  Smoke a joint in the car smoke a bowl in the car. We'll go crazy and spray a little hit of ozium
[24:43.940 --> 24:50.180]  Just one. Yeah, cuz two dashes of that. It's too powerful good one. And yeah, the car smells like oranges for a week
[24:50.540 --> 24:55.580]  This one is platinum tangy, so you got platinum cookies right Angie cross to the golden goat
[24:55.580 --> 24:58.420]  So and feminized as well, right eyes as well
[24:58.420 --> 25:01.700]  It's so fucking important people give me seeds all the time
[25:01.700 --> 25:04.980]  And I was looking through and being like I need some stuff to plant
[25:04.980 --> 25:09.340]  I was gonna actually for the greenhouse and I was like, I don't want to go on a female hunt
[25:09.340 --> 25:10.500]  Yeah, not only a female hunt
[25:10.500 --> 25:12.180]  I don't want to lose half my crop to
[25:12.180 --> 25:17.700]  Males and you don't want to accidentally pollinate the neighbors for the next three miles if you forget a male and the wind comes
[25:17.700 --> 25:21.820]  Yeah, people forget about that. I think that's one of the things we need to pay more attention to
[25:21.820 --> 25:27.140]  So yeah fem seeds for lots of new Instagram breeders online now, they all come from here. It'll come
[25:27.780 --> 25:33.940]  They're all come from within a half mile of my mail. That's it. So, you know what everybody's crosses, right?
[25:33.940 --> 25:39.380]  Yeah, right, and then I've got the the staple the golden goat s1 some of those labels get confusing
[25:39.380 --> 25:44.420]  It's a golden goat reversed. So I made golden goat to create pollen and put that on another golden goat
[25:44.420 --> 25:46.180]  So it's just a self golden goat, you know
[25:46.180 --> 25:51.740]  I heard you say golden goat and I was already thinking of my next question and I just have to stop and cuz that's a
[25:51.740 --> 25:54.820]  Really special strain. I grew up when I first got here
[25:55.740 --> 26:01.940]  Amazing flavor to it a great plant, you know, just a big just a beautiful plant. Yeah, and
[26:02.780 --> 26:09.300]  Man, who was it that made that shatter? Was it was it a darkness gross grows and that beautiful orange shadow
[26:09.500 --> 26:16.640]  Opened that slab this smell hit my face and came back down and I went oh, that's the most delicious golden goat and he smiled
[26:17.260 --> 26:23.940]  Golden goat. It's absolutely beautiful. It was so delicious. Yeah. Yeah wonderful job with that. You can't lose with that plant
[26:23.940 --> 26:27.940]  You can't you can crack it. You could twist it. You can kick it over. Yeah, and it just grows it goes
[26:27.940 --> 26:32.020]  Okay now that's why the dude gave it to me when I first got here. That was the one he gave
[26:33.700 --> 26:36.660]  Set you up for success. Well, that's partly why I love breeding with her
[26:36.660 --> 26:41.740]  You can't do her wrong, right if the pH is too high or too low sugar then that'll be alright
[26:41.740 --> 26:44.780]  I sure likes a lot of nutrients so you can't really overfeed her
[26:44.780 --> 26:50.460]  It's real simple to work with I'm good potency good flavor good harvest and she breeds really well now
[26:50.460 --> 26:54.440]  You said as long as you're good at explaining stuff, so I'm gonna take a little lesson
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.180]  I'll be listening in this back and I keep on glossing over stuff
[26:57.340 --> 27:00.860]  How'd you get the golden goat again? Cuz I want to learn this you reversed
[27:00.860 --> 27:06.260]  Did you say reverse what the the seeds come from making getting a golden goat clone, right?
[27:06.260 --> 27:10.820]  And I treat it with a silver thiosulfate got a mission and it turns it into it's basically a male
[27:10.820 --> 27:16.460]  It looks like a male, but it's still a female. It's just got male pollen sacks with female pollen
[27:16.460 --> 27:21.940]  Got it, and I put that on a female plant. So it's just golden goat to golden goat. Okay, I got the plant
[27:21.940 --> 27:27.180]  I didn't create it. A lot of people think I made golden goat. I didn't I got it as a gift from my friend
[27:27.180 --> 27:30.540]  Who I call pineapple Express. All right, he's actually from Hawaii
[27:30.540 --> 27:35.180]  The golden goat has nothing to do with Hawaii, but my friend pineapple Express is from Hawaii
[27:35.820 --> 27:39.140]  That's what I named him. That's just his nickname. He doesn't want his real name out there
[27:39.140 --> 27:42.420]  Sure, so he got that clone from another person. It actually came from
[27:42.940 --> 27:47.500]  Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas. He read yes Topeka, Kansas
[27:47.500 --> 27:53.700]  There's a recycling center in Topeka known as the golden goat recycling plant and it's a hundred degrees out here
[27:53.700 --> 27:57.820]  Imagine if I had a bunch of soda bottles out there and how sweet and sticky and good that would smell right?
[27:57.940 --> 28:04.140]  Smells like a golden goat plant and that's why he named it golden goat after the golden goat recycling center. Yeah, that's a lesson
[28:04.140 --> 28:09.680]  A lot of people probably I get credit for it quite often and it was not me. I didn't create that. Huh? Okay
[28:09.700 --> 28:14.060]  Yeah, mr. Dank from Topeka, Kansas. It's Island sweets gunk Hawaiian sativa and Romulan
[28:14.060 --> 28:18.340]  Oh, I remember the Romulan back in the great and that's what keeps it short and squat
[28:18.340 --> 28:20.460]  That's what because the other two are tall monster, right?
[28:20.700 --> 28:23.420]  Keeps it short and keeps the finishing time down. Is that Romulan?
[28:24.420 --> 28:28.220]  Beautiful great job with the Romulan excellent lineage. Yes
[28:28.220 --> 28:33.140]  All right, and I will just go back and touch on dude feminized seeds. You give me a five pack
[28:33.140 --> 28:37.540]  I know I got five females. Yes, that's big for me. You don't have to pull those boys down
[28:37.540 --> 28:41.560]  You'll find one that looks just like what you're looking for. Yeah, easy. Yeah, I love it
[28:41.560 --> 28:45.620]  I love yours. So I hope you find a keeper in there. Oh, I will brought some for the DGC crew
[28:46.180 --> 28:51.300]  Thank you so much door prizes, yes, sir, gotta share the love will do it take good care of me I
[28:52.500 --> 28:58.500]  Appreciate it man. Yeah, you right back at you reciprocation. That's what makes the world go around respect for us. Let's go respect
[28:59.180 --> 29:05.200]  Respect. I love being in Jamaica. That's all you're reminding me of we got to get Steve and go god the weed there
[29:05.200 --> 29:07.860]  It's just outdoor weed, but it got me so high. What do they say?
[29:07.860 --> 29:11.980]  I think I learned in sixth grade health set and setting, you know who you're hanging out with
[29:12.060 --> 29:18.100]  Yeah, and where you're at I'm like just going down a river in Jamaica smoking a freaking fat one
[29:20.100 --> 29:23.300]  Yes, yeah, yes called Irie that feeling
[29:25.780 --> 29:29.060]  I love it. I love it. Hey do me a favor man
[29:29.060 --> 29:34.100]  Tell me a little bit about your grow and give me a little bit of you gave me a we're working and we've been
[29:34.380 --> 29:38.860]  Collaborating lately. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So sometimes I don't know these concentrate companies
[29:38.860 --> 29:44.340]  I don't really know exactly, you know some of the specific questions to ask so I was getting with Jeff and one of the questions
[29:44.340 --> 29:46.060]  He said to me was hey, man
[29:46.060 --> 29:52.900]  How would these guys assure that they're delivering a really high quality a really clean medical product, you know IPM?
[29:53.020 --> 29:58.780]  You know nutrients leach in that kind of stuff even going as far as having mold on there, you know
[29:58.780 --> 30:03.340]  Are you know curing processes man? I'll ask you this, you know ask you the same thing
[30:03.340 --> 30:05.660]  you're not in a commercial production like that, but
[30:06.380 --> 30:13.620]  What what kind of advice could you give as far as IPM as far as keeping a good making a good safe product
[30:14.420 --> 30:20.020]  Even I do consulting for commercial grows, right? So I know and I'm also certified by the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[30:21.020 --> 30:26.940]  Everything I do in any grow I follow Colorado Colorado Department of Agriculture and Marijuana Enforcement Division
[30:27.620 --> 30:29.220]  pesticide guidelines, right
[30:29.220 --> 30:34.820]  So nothing I put in any grow that I consult for none of my personal grows none of my breeding grows if the Colorado
[30:34.860 --> 30:37.020]  Department of Ag won't let us use it. I don't use it
[30:37.020 --> 30:42.220]  Sure, I'm not restricted by those guidelines in my private grow, but I still choose to follow that sort of a restriction
[30:42.220 --> 30:46.740]  Yeah, I mean that concentrates are exactly what they say your cause you're taking it
[30:46.740 --> 30:51.680]  Yeah, you think about somebody yields from these things you take a whole plant and get three grams out of it or something
[30:51.720 --> 30:56.060]  you're taking that all the essence of that whole plant or at least all the trichomes and
[30:57.220 --> 31:01.940]  Concentrating it down dude. If there's even a tiny fraction of pesticide on there. Oh, yeah
[31:02.300 --> 31:07.120]  Enough that you smoke a little flower and it'd be okay. Now you're concentrating it down to where you're smoking
[31:07.660 --> 31:13.780]  Right, it may be sprayed on that plant. You just basically broke that back down into a little ball. It's dangerous
[31:13.780 --> 31:14.740]  I smelled sulfur
[31:14.740 --> 31:19.980]  I've tasted sulfur before the concentrate tastes like fish or like burnt fish or something, right?
[31:19.980 --> 31:21.980]  They use sulfur too late in their flowering process
[31:22.260 --> 31:25.900]  Really what that's from and I mean you can I could see that happening, you know
[31:25.900 --> 31:27.180]  Yeah, I could put it this way
[31:27.180 --> 31:32.460]  I could see somebody making that mistake if I had a big pot of soup or chili
[31:32.500 --> 31:35.580]  How much pesticide can I put in there that you still want to eat it?
[31:35.580 --> 31:38.260]  You know, that's how much you like the people you're serving
[31:40.060 --> 31:42.140]  Absolutely, right come on guys, it's really right
[31:42.700 --> 31:47.660]  Come on, and we've all gotten I had thrips before I used the mammoth IPM and knocked them out for me
[31:47.660 --> 31:52.960]  What do you do when you have bugs? Are you preventing it with with other bugs? Give me some advice in veg
[31:52.960 --> 31:58.160]  I am a spray guy. I like to use a reliable sprays in veg later on to the veg phase
[31:58.160 --> 32:01.420]  I like to get the the predator bugs going. I like to use swarski's
[32:02.040 --> 32:07.680]  Depends on what kind of pests I think I'm gonna get right skis are always the go-to nice swarski's and green lace wings
[32:08.360 --> 32:09.940]  They're definitely
[32:09.940 --> 32:13.440]  Aggressive and they'll keep anything away. So if you get them colonized and get them started
[32:13.440 --> 32:19.800]  I like to so I do the sprays it's easier to spray smaller plants and control them keep the moms all sprayed up
[32:19.800 --> 32:22.760]  It's reliable and as I move toward the flowering phase, I'll start releasing
[32:23.280 --> 32:29.200]  Massive amounts of predator bugs my god and they're always filled with predators and I like to keep perpetual flowering areas
[32:29.200 --> 32:31.640]  So there's always predators over here
[32:31.640 --> 32:35.920]  So just move to the next spot as they come in and they're coming from the late veg plants
[32:35.920 --> 32:38.680]  So I like to start with sprays and then move to the predator bugs
[32:38.680 --> 32:44.560]  I also do a lot of defoliation if you defoliate that's less opportunity for a pathogen, right?
[32:44.560 --> 32:46.920]  If you don't have a leaf that where's that bug gonna go?
[32:46.960 --> 32:49.760]  Come on, give us give us your advice on day. What and day?
[32:49.760 --> 32:55.360]  What do you defoliate you got specific days when I go into flower? I defoliate hard. I put on the trellis
[32:55.360 --> 32:57.360]  I pop all the sticks. I trust all the stems
[32:57.360 --> 33:01.280]  I work everything into the net and I take off quite a bit of loose a twist on the stem super cropping
[33:01.280 --> 33:04.520]  That's a super crop and put one hand here one hand here and give it a twist. Yep
[33:04.520 --> 33:08.480]  Google that if y'all don't know that's an interesting technique. It sounds just like a knuckle pops
[33:08.480 --> 33:09.760]  That's how you know, you did it, right?
[33:09.760 --> 33:11.760]  Yeah, go up a few inches and do it again
[33:11.880 --> 33:15.440]  Let that heal about two or three weeks and go back and do it all over again, right?
[33:15.440 --> 33:19.600]  Yeah, I like to do and that'll prevent your stretch in early flower. So I'll do that on day one
[33:19.600 --> 33:25.200]  I'll do defoliation in about week three do some defoliation then again about week five or six, okay?
[33:25.200 --> 33:30.100]  And then as they mature and harvest I'll just strip them as they're getting close to the end week eight week nine
[33:30.100 --> 33:35.200]  Really? Yeah. Well a lot of times I'm in a large commercial cultivation facility with hundreds of lights, right?
[33:35.200 --> 33:38.160]  And so I'll just send a crew of dudes in there and just say make them naked boys
[33:38.160 --> 33:42.040]  And that way when it comes time for harvest, you don't have all that leaf to take off you chop them
[33:42.040 --> 33:47.600]  Hang them upside down. You don't have that mess of chlorophyll basically to deal with. Yeah, I used to do that
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.560]  I think sure I think it was in the 90s that people like yes strip off all the leaves boys, you know
[33:52.560 --> 33:58.280]  You only want buds. Yep. And yeah, I wasn't sure that take not the science behind that. So I stopped doing it
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.480]  You're saying you don't if you do it late enough, you're not seeing any negative. So you do it late enough
[34:02.480 --> 34:04.960]  You don't see any negatives. I've already done what they're gonna do
[34:04.960 --> 34:08.760]  You're just working and I don't strip them completely naked naked, but right at the end, right?
[34:08.760 --> 34:10.760]  We'll go naked but we've got to week six there
[34:10.760 --> 34:15.560]  I'm keeping some of the bigger leaves, but I take if it's got a purple petiole that comes off like a purple
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.880]  Something that'll stay there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I want as much light penetration as I can get
[34:20.880 --> 34:25.000]  I want as much airflow as I can get right in a big it changes when you're in a big facility
[34:25.320 --> 34:30.080]  That one little spot of powdery mildew can multiply. Oh, yeah pounds and pounds
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.000]  I'm not risking one pound like in a home, right? I'm risking 500 pounds
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.720]  Sure, so I've got to be a little more aggressive with my prevention
[34:36.720 --> 34:41.640]  And as far as PM goes you got any I mean any advice there correct the rooms. It's all about
[34:42.320 --> 34:45.860]  VPD we talked about VPD a lot of our shows all about proper
[34:45.920 --> 34:51.200]  Yeah, no micro climates people forget that you need a fan here and sure not just way over there
[34:51.200 --> 34:54.120]  They used to be my I was like, I never got powdery mildew
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.080]  But I'll be damned if I didn't be go crazy with the fans
[34:57.080 --> 34:58.960]  You wouldn't be like dude, what's up with you in these fans?
[34:58.960 --> 35:02.560]  I get big floor fans and put a fan on the floor and point it up
[35:02.560 --> 35:05.560]  Yeah, and over there and point it down. Yeah, and don't have all your fans
[35:05.560 --> 35:10.280]  I've seen rooms where all the fans oscillate together. You're just moving you want to stir the air?
[35:10.280 --> 35:13.360]  Yeah, it was moving that heat over here and move the heat over here
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.800]  We want to mix it so the heat and the cool and the humid and the you know combines
[35:16.800 --> 35:23.200]  Yeah, and since we're talking grow VPD is basically vapor pressure deficit. We talked about it all the time
[35:23.200 --> 35:25.440]  If you it's this first time you tuned in here
[35:25.440 --> 35:31.800]  It's basically the pressure that's keeping the water onto the leaf if you're able to get it correctly the leaves actually able to
[35:32.240 --> 35:38.000]  Respire and breathe basically. Yes. Yeah, it's almost like if we were in a rubber suit man. Yeah, I'm gonna work so good
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.360]  Yeah, you're getting good at this Scotty. Oh, man. Where's my mr. Analogy coffee cup man another gold star for you. I
[35:45.480 --> 35:50.160]  Appreciate I love bullshitting with you about grow. I also like bullshitting with you
[35:50.160 --> 35:54.160]  You know if you listen to the show, I'm more about the culture. I'm more about what's it right?
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.640]  Just didn't what's happening now and we listen to all the same podcasts. We're in all the same shit
[35:59.640 --> 36:03.120]  It's an absolute revolution what's happening, I love it
[36:03.120 --> 36:06.680]  I got my mother-in-law using started off with CBD now
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.680]  She hits the pen every now and again, you know, but I never would I don't say I never would have thought
[36:11.680 --> 36:13.600]  I don't know would have been hard to imagine this
[36:13.600 --> 36:20.160]  I think the the easy way that we got in here is because it is really good medicine
[36:20.160 --> 36:27.520]  It is super easy to convince people that this is really good medicine. Usually it just takes one hit off one of those price
[36:28.240 --> 36:34.960]  If you were running things man, all right, if you had a minute to talk I would tell you my father-in-law, holy shit
[36:34.960 --> 36:38.880]  He don't believe it man. You don't believe you just you stay the course
[36:38.880 --> 36:39.360]  actually
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.280]  It was weird because I you knew I was a grower and never admitted it and then after it became legal and I came here
[36:44.280 --> 36:47.160]  And he goes up good. I'm glad I just didn't want you breaking the law
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.800]  He had a problem breaking the law not cannabis as medicine or anything like that
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.760]  But if you were trying to convince somebody like him that cannabis is real medicine
[36:56.920 --> 37:02.640]  What would you say? Oh, I got a minute. I had a traumatic brain injury in 2015
[37:02.640 --> 37:05.640]  And I'm usually a pretty upbeat guy. You could tell I like life, right?
[37:05.640 --> 37:10.920]  I'm not dark and sad crazy. Absolutely. My brain injury had me thinking it was tricking me into thinking
[37:10.920 --> 37:16.640]  I wanted to hurt myself and do bad things to my life and I knew that wasn't right, right?
[37:16.640 --> 37:22.040]  But my head hurts so bad and my thoughts are so twisted from a brain injury like my brain just my wires were fucking
[37:22.440 --> 37:24.480]  I get it. I was going purple orange
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.800]  I thought that purple was orange now and I thought that a burrito was called a banana. Oh, I shit
[37:29.880 --> 37:31.240]  Yeah, that's where my brain was
[37:31.240 --> 37:35.480]  It took a while for it to come back and then amazing how it works and they're like you have something like that
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.160]  You're like, I can't believe it worked in the first place. My computer was scrambled
[37:39.160 --> 37:43.600]  Yeah, and then you go to the doctor and you feel you're like, no we can watch it work
[37:43.600 --> 37:45.880]  We kind of we don't really know how it works though
[37:46.680 --> 37:48.320]  They tried were scary
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.960]  One of my friends was entering a cannabis cup for a CBD concentrate and he said hit this and I said, okay
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.920]  Right when I was smoking dabs or flowers, it would make my head throb from the injury
[37:58.920 --> 38:05.000]  I hit I dabbed that CBD and it felt like I had a belt around my head and when I hit that CBD
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.800]  It felt like he just went back there and turned a little knob that loosened that belt two or three notches really. Oh
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.880]  And as soon as I hit it and exhaled his girlfriend goes give him another one
[38:15.120 --> 38:19.000]  Just like they could see my puzzle pieces just coming. I was like, whoa
[38:19.480 --> 38:23.960]  Like hey, hey guys, like I'm back and they're like keep hitting this Wow
[38:23.960 --> 38:28.440]  So they gave me a few days supplied like I can't give you a lot right cannabis cup entry
[38:28.440 --> 38:32.000]  But here's you know, it's working hit this and so I smoked CBD first
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.080]  So I don't like CBD now, right?
[38:34.080 --> 38:38.620]  But I smoked CBD for several days and then it kind of put me back on the trade sped up my healing
[38:38.620 --> 38:44.700]  Whatever was happening in my brain it put it back together. I knew 2000 when she's high as 2015. Holy crap
[38:44.700 --> 38:50.340]  Yeah, that's not long. No long ago, and I'm pretty much back to there are still things that happen. It's your sure
[38:50.340 --> 38:54.300]  Oh, you ever have the thoughts and you're going? Hey, wait, we're I don't end up in this room
[38:55.020 --> 38:59.520]  Like only when I'm super duper stoned now at the end of the joint of the way
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.760]  What room am I and see when I smoke my brain doesn't I say that there's like a skip on my record wherever I hit
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.880]  Right, my record was spinning. I dinged it right there. And so and so and so sometimes I
[39:10.880 --> 39:16.000]  Right when I smoke that little they wipe off the skips on my record when I dab like the lemon
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.680]  Jeffrey sure golden go the right the right strains will just clean my my skips right on up. So that's
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.200]  That's amazing. I want to kill myself anymore from consuming CBD and that sounds really weird to say, but I wasn't
[39:27.200 --> 39:30.640]  It wasn't like me being crazy. It was a brain injury an injury that this thing saw
[39:30.640 --> 39:32.640]  I mean CBD really does have anti-inflammatory
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.040]  Properties, I mean if you think about what inflammation is
[39:36.800 --> 39:40.320]  Shoving everything together that don't need to be together. We don't need our space man
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.200]  My three brain cells that get along we're fighting in there, you know, I get clustered together
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.280]  Yeah, dude, but you're in business then right you've been trying. Yeah, I'm a fucking keep motivated when you got something like that
[39:52.280 --> 39:59.280]  How do you motivate it in general man? You just get up every day man. I should do the passion. I love cannabis
[39:59.280 --> 40:04.160]  I loved it before my brain injury it it sure my my smile you could tell I talked too much and it I
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.600]  Talked to just right brother. Just right. I would talk too much then if I didn't consume right?
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.240]  but so the brain injury the just the passion and then I became a
[40:13.320 --> 40:19.120]  caregiver and I was involved in the medical marijuana from the beginning very cool people would come to our dispensary and we would I
[40:19.120 --> 40:21.760]  Had time then at dispensaries to sit just like this, right?
[40:21.880 --> 40:26.540]  What's wrong and they would say it hurts and I would say where and they would tell me how and where and I'd say
[40:26.540 --> 40:29.980]  Oh you want this strain and we'd actually get to develop that so I would see
[40:30.500 --> 40:35.620]  young guys like you and I and little old ladies and everybody all walks of life would come in and
[40:35.820 --> 40:41.660]  After a week of talking to me and consuming a product I recommend they would I would see improvement in their quality of life
[40:41.900 --> 40:47.620]  Just a better smile. Yeah, maybe a little more pep in their step and do that put something in you that is irreplaceable
[40:47.620 --> 40:53.740]  I'm a father and that that's a magical feeling that thing when you see other people healed from a product you made so true
[40:53.860 --> 40:55.460]  Next best thing
[40:55.460 --> 40:57.500]  The next best. Yeah, it's funny
[40:57.500 --> 41:03.220]  we were talking about this book that I read and it talks about the joy of being able to actually produce something and then say
[41:03.220 --> 41:05.620]  That see something that you produce like be enjoyed
[41:05.780 --> 41:12.420]  It gives you like a fulfillment and the book was about a lot of people don't get that anymore because we stop producing most stuff
[41:12.420 --> 41:13.820]  Oh, yeah
[41:13.820 --> 41:19.140]  Just talk about it. Yeah. Well, I get to make seeds. I get to teach people how to grow
[41:19.140 --> 41:25.660]  I see people grow those seeds. I see people grow for other people. I'm sure I see my best friend Mike
[41:25.660 --> 41:29.640]  He smokes a product I grow he shows up to my house going fucking back hurts, dude
[41:29.860 --> 41:37.300]  Takes two dabs and goes. Oh, thank you, buddy. Yeah, it's the dab and the social interaction. Those are medicinal and therapeutics
[41:37.300 --> 41:42.740]  We're making people feel better and then to keep me motivated dude. I've got the DGC. I've got the ivory army
[41:43.260 --> 41:45.560]  Anytime I wake up and I'm like, oh, it's a bummer day
[41:45.560 --> 41:49.280]  I open up the social media and there's not all people saying killer podcast
[41:49.280 --> 41:53.880]  Thanks for teaching me how to grow you look great and you can't be down when you have support like that
[41:53.880 --> 41:58.160]  No, so it's that's part of what does it and we talked about checking out the one negative?
[41:58.160 --> 42:03.960]  But a hundred people that say nice things and all our friends it does drown it out very significantly does
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.800]  Yeah, it's just weird how your brain works. Oh, yeah, you don't want that bad. You want to make everybody happy
[42:08.800 --> 42:10.760]  You know what? I think it is. I think it's primal
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.540]  I think it's like when when you would see a fire back in the day, you know from being thousands of years
[42:15.540 --> 42:20.300]  A guy back stamp out that fire, you know as a potential problem there when somebody falls you want to pick them up
[42:20.300 --> 42:26.240]  Yeah, I think it's really like you you want to pick them up make money. Sometimes you're just gonna say it's not me
[42:26.240 --> 42:28.240]  This one's you bubba
[42:28.380 --> 42:34.540]  Yeah, I tried hard on that podcast. I'm sorry. You didn't learn anything. Hey, what can you do? All right, we'll wrap this up
[42:34.540 --> 42:37.620]  I've enjoyed the hell out of talking. This is great. Are we gonna start the podcast?
[42:38.400 --> 42:40.740]  Yeah, did we turn the cameras on Kyle?

[42:56.580 --> 43:01.660]  I give a little parting words of wisdom. There's probably someone that's younger than us
[43:01.660 --> 43:07.380]  I'm sure most people are younger than than me. Anyhow that are sitting here being like man rosted Jeff awesome
[43:07.380 --> 43:09.740]  I'd love to have a career like that. I'd love to have
[43:10.260 --> 43:12.220]  Let's say life like that. That's creepy
[43:12.220 --> 43:18.660]  What do they just think of you as a role model give me some people some advice on the business end on the anything you want
[43:18.660 --> 43:22.940]  And it just do what is right for you. You can't follow you can't judge yourself by anybody else
[43:22.940 --> 43:26.180]  I can't look at you and say well Scott. He's doing this. I need to do this. I know what I need
[43:26.180 --> 43:29.540]  I want I know what works for me do what is for you

[43:39.220 --> 43:41.800]  Don't follow the hype don't follow the money follow your heart
[43:42.460 --> 43:45.220]  Grow from your heart. That's the name of my podcast or a reason
[43:45.220 --> 43:48.780]  So do it all from the way it should be done do what's right and just listen to yourself
[43:48.860 --> 43:52.460]  Listen to your heart listen to whatever you believe in and I think you'll get where you need to be
[43:52.460 --> 43:57.340]  Don't don't listen to social media. Don't listen to the YouTube haters. Don't listen to your whoever
[43:57.340 --> 44:01.620]  Well, how do you get information though? I get a lot of information through saying, okay
[44:01.620 --> 44:06.820]  We can get information and encouragement and things but I don't get don't take too much life direction
[44:06.820 --> 44:12.940]  Yeah, because everyone's gonna say you should don't let people should on you like yeah, don't let people should on you
[44:14.540 --> 44:17.280]  Can I make that a bumper sticker I would love to see that as a sticker
[44:17.940 --> 44:21.660]  Do what you feel you should right? You know, you they don't know your goal
[44:21.660 --> 44:24.420]  You may see that I want a seed company and I want to be a breeder
[44:24.420 --> 44:26.020]  You'll say you should do this, right?
[44:26.020 --> 44:30.020]  That also I want to be a podcaster and a dad and your idea may not work
[44:30.020 --> 44:31.860]  So I've got to do what's right for me
[44:31.860 --> 44:35.380]  I wish I could give somebody better advice and say like you need to do these steps
[44:35.380 --> 44:38.820]  But do the steps and you'll know what the steps are, right?
[44:38.820 --> 44:45.180]  Oh, whatever your path is the steps will come and avoid the bullshit. You'll know, you know when there's bullshit, you know
[44:45.180 --> 44:48.500]  Oh, yeah, like whatever you're doing even when you're driving you're like, I'm gonna go to fat
[44:48.500 --> 44:50.300]  You feel you know driving too fast
[44:50.300 --> 44:50.700]  All right
[44:50.700 --> 44:53.460]  I'm gonna get a ticket for this right like don't do that and
[44:53.620 --> 44:57.020]  Stay on the highway and get to Fort Collins on time and do the show. Yeah
[44:57.020 --> 45:02.220]  Yeah, I will say a positive attitude is huge being when you have a positive attitude
[45:02.220 --> 45:07.500]  I love being around you always a smile. I same about you. So I think that's big
[45:07.500 --> 45:11.860]  I think you really have to associate you have to find people that want to help you that want to teach you things
[45:11.860 --> 45:17.580]  And man people don't want to teach you things if you got a big sourpuss, right, right? Yeah
[45:17.580 --> 45:19.180]  Yeah, why am I gonna teach you something?
[45:19.180 --> 45:23.260]  You're just gonna be negative about it or I more positive energy someone that's gonna share what they learned
[45:23.620 --> 45:25.580]  That's what we got it. One thing I try to do
[45:25.580 --> 45:30.500]  I give credit to the people who taught me I a lot of times I say I learned this from this person, right?
[45:30.500 --> 45:34.020]  And that's just giving credit to my sources. I don't feel like I'm the Wizard of Oz
[45:34.220 --> 45:38.440]  Now we all things from other sources a lot of them. I was reading another book
[45:38.440 --> 45:44.500]  It's called steel like an artist and it was telling you that good luck trying to have a completely original thought you've got it from somewhere
[45:44.500 --> 45:51.020]  Oh, you know, so you're motivated by things just take it and I mean breeding is the same way typical expression
[45:51.020 --> 45:53.020]  Is that what we were doing?
[45:53.540 --> 46:00.660]  Art and re-expressing. Yeah, I didn't invent the genetic code though, right, right? I love it. Good bullshit with you, brother
[46:00.660 --> 46:06.660]  Every time it's vacation week man. You came up and I had a good time. Keep it. I re I love it, brother

[46:14.100 --> 46:20.300]  So before that it could be could be I've got a couple plans. I'll talk. All right it I'm excited
