[00:00.000 --> 00:05.800]  Welcome back everybody, it's time for episode 387 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.800 --> 00:09.140]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.140 --> 00:13.820]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:13.820 --> 00:19.780]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.780 --> 00:23.880]  It's become a tradition that I start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[00:23.880 --> 00:29.240]  I just took a ridiculous dab of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:29.240 --> 00:32.420]  Everybody knows I love the Stardog, it is one of my favorite strains.
[00:32.420 --> 00:35.420]  This is going to be a great podcast intro.
[00:35.420 --> 00:38.960]  If you've been following along with the podcast, you know that I've been doing a long series
[00:38.960 --> 00:40.520]  of grow lessons.
[00:40.520 --> 00:45.440]  This episode is going to be a repost of an episode about determining ripeness.
[00:45.440 --> 00:48.840]  This was originally posted as episode number 319.
[00:48.840 --> 00:51.080]  This episode does feature White Mike.
[00:51.080 --> 00:55.760]  The original episode was about 45 minutes long, but I cut out the part about determining
[00:55.760 --> 00:58.960]  ripeness and that was approximately 20 minutes.
[00:58.960 --> 01:02.480]  I plan to be out of town for a couple of days this week, so I won't be able to put
[01:02.480 --> 01:04.680]  together a quality podcast.
[01:04.680 --> 01:09.000]  I've got this episode about determining ripeness and I feel like it falls perfectly in line
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.200]  with the grow series that we have been doing.
[01:11.200 --> 01:14.880]  So ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's jump right into this old school episode
[01:14.880 --> 01:17.800]  of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast featuring White Mike.
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is episode 319, determining ripeness, reposted as episode
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.040]  387.
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.560]  I do hope you enjoy it.
[01:25.560 --> 01:28.080]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:28.080 --> 01:32.120]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:32.120 --> 01:33.600]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:33.600 --> 01:38.080]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[01:38.080 --> 01:42.320]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.920]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:46.920 --> 01:48.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.880]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.860]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:55.860 --> 02:00.240]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:00.240 --> 02:03.740]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:03.740 --> 02:07.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong or start heating up that
[02:07.860 --> 02:17.640]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.640]  What's up podcast world?
[02:18.640 --> 02:21.700]  It's time for episode 319 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[02:21.700 --> 02:22.880]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:22.880 --> 02:24.800]  Sitting across the table is White Mike.
[02:24.800 --> 02:25.800]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[02:25.800 --> 02:26.800]  Thanks man.
[02:26.800 --> 02:27.800]  Thanks for having me.
[02:27.800 --> 02:30.680]  I'm sorry, I'm taking time out of the busy schedule of two kids.
[02:30.680 --> 02:31.680]  Congratulations.
[02:31.680 --> 02:32.680]  Dos ninos, it's a lot.
[02:32.680 --> 02:33.680]  Dos ninos.
[02:33.680 --> 02:34.680]  Yeah, you can tell where we're from.
[02:34.680 --> 02:35.680]  Welcome.
[02:35.680 --> 02:40.240]  We're doing a show from Pueblo, Colorado where the white guys speak real good Spanish.
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.320]  I was just in an Instagram live feed and somebody tried to throw out some German and I responded
[02:44.320 --> 02:47.160]  in German and the whole room just went silent.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.760]  The entire chat stopped.
[02:48.760 --> 02:51.120]  I was like, well, I apologize for that.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.120]  I thought that was funny.
[02:52.120 --> 02:53.960]  Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53.960 --> 02:54.960]  Welcome Mike's on the show.
[02:54.960 --> 02:57.720]  We're going to do a show about, what are we going to talk about?
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.920]  Determining ripeness and when to harvest your cannabis plants.
[03:00.920 --> 03:06.360]  Before we get there, you know I like to start the episodes by stocking about.
[03:06.360 --> 03:09.040]  Let's talk about what I've been dabbing.
[03:09.040 --> 03:10.960]  That was hard to say.
[03:10.960 --> 03:16.600]  I've been taking dabs of some Viola Labs Clementine Cookies Live Resin.
[03:16.600 --> 03:19.160]  I'm opening it up to smell it right now.
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.080]  It is like spicy orange candy and I really love the smell and flavor of this.
[03:25.080 --> 03:27.320]  I picked up three grams today when I went.
[03:27.920 --> 03:29.920]  I usually just get one gram of each flavor.
[03:29.920 --> 03:30.920]  I was like, do they have more of that?
[03:30.920 --> 03:31.920]  They do.
[03:31.920 --> 03:34.320]  I'll just take three and I will be on my way.
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.160]  Mike is it time to change that microphone cover?
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.080]  Is that what you're subliminally telling me right now?
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.160]  It's got a furry spot, but I've got Malamute, so I'm used to furry spots.
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.600]  We're going to blame that on your Malamutes.
[03:45.600 --> 03:48.800]  It's not Malamute hair, but it's not hippie hair either.
[03:48.800 --> 03:50.920]  So I'm cool just pulling it off and rolling with it.
[03:50.920 --> 03:53.560]  But yeah, we might want to look for a new cover after this show.
[03:53.560 --> 03:55.720]  Welcome to the furry spot podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55.720 --> 03:56.920]  It's going to be that kind of show.
[03:56.920 --> 03:59.000]  We're going to put this show back on track.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.800]  We've got a couple of sponsors we should shout out.
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.760]  Shout out to my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[04:02.760 --> 04:03.760]  Shout out to water.
[04:03.760 --> 04:04.840]  Shout out to water.
[04:04.840 --> 04:05.840]  You're drinking water now.
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.200]  You guys, Mike is drinking water.
[04:07.200 --> 04:08.200]  This is like a rare occasion.
[04:08.200 --> 04:11.320]  I didn't pack properly for this mission.
[04:11.320 --> 04:12.480]  Then some water's happening.
[04:12.480 --> 04:14.960]  You need some water anyway, but I don't feel bad for you.
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.520]  And then he went and spilled half of it right down your face.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.520]  Mike's drinking water.
[04:18.520 --> 04:19.520]  You guys, that's a rare occasion.
[04:19.520 --> 04:20.520]  Ah, the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[04:20.520 --> 04:26.120]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store.
[04:26.320 --> 04:28.680]  Our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[04:28.680 --> 04:31.680]  Also support more of my friends, PL Grow Systems.
[04:31.680 --> 04:35.720]  Guys, I know you want to know what's going on in your grow room at all times.
[04:35.720 --> 04:38.360]  Sometimes you're away and you're like, I wonder if that air conditioner clicked on.
[04:38.360 --> 04:39.360]  It's pretty hot outside.
[04:39.360 --> 04:41.600]  I wonder if that air conditioner is working.
[04:41.600 --> 04:42.600]  I wonder.
[04:42.600 --> 04:43.600]  You can't even focus.
[04:43.600 --> 04:44.600]  You can't even think about what you're doing.
[04:44.600 --> 04:45.960]  You're like, ah, is that air conditioner working?
[04:45.960 --> 04:48.200]  You want to drive home and look, but you can't drive home.
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.200]  You're just freaking out.
[04:49.200 --> 04:50.200]  You know what?
[04:50.200 --> 04:51.200]  Bust out your phone.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.560]  Check out your PL Minder unit.
[04:52.560 --> 04:54.520]  You can see what's going on in your grow room at all times.
[04:55.120 --> 04:56.120]  How do you get a PL grow?
[04:56.120 --> 04:57.680]  How do you get a PL Minder unit?
[04:57.680 --> 04:59.040]  You go to PL grow dot systems.
[04:59.040 --> 05:00.040]  That's how.
[05:00.040 --> 05:01.040]  Check them out.
[05:01.040 --> 05:02.040]  A PL grow dot systems.
[05:02.040 --> 05:03.040]  You guys.
[05:03.040 --> 05:04.040]  PL grow systems.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.040]  Minder unit.
[05:05.040 --> 05:06.880]  We'll let you know what's going on in your grow room at all times.
[05:06.880 --> 05:07.880]  You can relax.
[05:07.880 --> 05:08.880]  You can enjoy what you're doing.
[05:08.880 --> 05:09.880]  It's awesome.
[05:09.880 --> 05:11.880]  All right, let's move forward.
[05:11.880 --> 05:14.880]  Uh, YouTube, you guys, all of the YouTube videos are caught up.
[05:14.880 --> 05:15.880]  I did it.
[05:15.880 --> 05:20.040]  It took a long time, but they are finally there.
[05:20.040 --> 05:23.560]  That was a multi-year project.
[05:23.600 --> 05:25.960]  YouTube got evil right before completion.
[05:25.960 --> 05:27.080]  Right at the scariest time.
[05:27.080 --> 05:31.000]  Yeah, I was just about caught up and then all of the YouTube channels started disappearing.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.600]  I don't put videos of myself consuming on this channel.
[05:34.600 --> 05:36.160]  That might be your saving grace.
[05:36.160 --> 05:38.560]  So yeah, I talk heavily about it, but they don't see it.
[05:38.560 --> 05:42.560]  So unless they're looking for it and someone reports it, we should be okay.
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.560]  We'll see how long it lasts.
[05:43.560 --> 05:46.760]  Either way, if it does disappear, I'll find a new place to put it.
[05:46.760 --> 05:47.760]  Don't worry.
[05:47.760 --> 05:51.160]  Um, YouTube is, uh, that's just another place for more people to listen to the show.
[05:51.160 --> 05:54.600]  I think we'll probably get more, more listens, more views, more interactions.
[05:54.600 --> 06:01.320]  All right, Mike, you got anything to say before we start talking about, um, determining ripeness
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.320]  on cannabis plants?
[06:02.320 --> 06:05.800]  You got any topics you want to bring before we get on a ramble here?
[06:05.800 --> 06:06.800]  Not yet.
[06:06.800 --> 06:07.800]  We'll just see where it takes us.
[06:07.800 --> 06:10.040]  Mike says, we'll see where this takes us.
[06:10.040 --> 06:11.040]  All right.
[06:11.040 --> 06:14.760]  So a lot of people were talking on Instagram live and on chat rooms right now about how
[06:14.760 --> 06:17.280]  to decide when to harvest their cannabis.
[06:17.280 --> 06:19.600]  When is my cannabis ripe?
[06:19.600 --> 06:23.640]  Um, the seed packs are going to tell you a certain timeframe.
[06:23.640 --> 06:25.640]  They're going to say 56 to 63 days.
[06:25.640 --> 06:27.400]  They're going to say 63 to 70 days.
[06:27.400 --> 06:30.400]  They're going to say nine to 10 weeks.
[06:30.400 --> 06:36.000]  The first time you run that pack of seeds, I would say go the longest timeframe that
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.360]  they give you as an option.
[06:37.360 --> 06:39.000]  At least plan for it for sure.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  Yes.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  Yeah.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.240]  If it says 10 weeks, nine to 10 weeks, go the 10 weeks because maybe in that last week,
[06:45.240 --> 06:48.060]  that's when you're going to see extra trichomes pack on.
[06:48.060 --> 06:49.940]  You're going to see the extra weight come on.
[06:49.940 --> 06:52.180]  You're going to see maybe some cool colors.
[06:52.180 --> 06:56.660]  You might, you may, you may see some shit you don't see if you cut it down at week nine.
[06:56.660 --> 06:57.660]  So let it go 10 weeks.
[06:57.660 --> 07:04.380]  If it says 10 weeks, if it says 56 to 63 days, let it go 63, let it go 65 if it looks okay
[07:04.380 --> 07:06.300]  and see what happens.
[07:06.300 --> 07:14.140]  So that being said, the way to determine ripeness of your cannabis plants is not by looking
[07:14.140 --> 07:16.180]  at the hairs.
[07:16.180 --> 07:20.100]  It is not by looking at the shape of the butt.
[07:20.100 --> 07:25.180]  It's not by looking at, I did air quotes when I said, I'm just, I'm hearing different people
[07:25.180 --> 07:29.820]  throughout my cannabis career.
[07:29.820 --> 07:36.180]  Like speaking at length about how all of those are telltale signs of, of like either perfect
[07:36.180 --> 07:40.500]  herb or good herb or, or completed or ready to harvest herb.
[07:40.500 --> 07:41.500]  It's all nonsense.
[07:41.500 --> 07:42.500]  Yeah.
[07:42.500 --> 07:47.460]  So what we are growing cannabis for the viable part that we want are the trichomes.
[07:47.460 --> 07:50.200]  Why would we look at anything but the trichomes, right?
[07:50.200 --> 07:53.420]  We want to harvest those when they're at their ripest point.
[07:53.420 --> 07:56.280]  So we should be paying attention to the trichomes.
[07:56.280 --> 08:00.260]  The only way you can do that, you can, if somebody tells you they can see the trichomes
[08:00.260 --> 08:05.820]  with their naked eye, either steal their eyes or kick them in the dick because they're a
[08:05.820 --> 08:06.820]  liar.
[08:06.820 --> 08:10.000]  You cannot see Amber trichomes without some sort of magnification.
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.080]  You need at least 60 X, maybe a hundred X magnification to see if a trichome is clear,
[08:16.080 --> 08:19.720]  cloudy, silver, milky, Amber busted, ruptured.
[08:19.720 --> 08:23.080]  If the head's broken off of it, you need magnification.
[08:23.080 --> 08:24.800]  You cannot see that with the naked eye.
[08:24.800 --> 08:27.040]  And if you can, you're fucking awesome.
[08:27.040 --> 08:28.040]  Send me a message.
[08:28.040 --> 08:29.040]  I want to hear about it.
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.040]  Yep.
[08:30.040 --> 08:31.040]  Good.
[08:31.040 --> 08:32.040]  Good on Amazon.
[08:32.040 --> 08:33.200]  Start looking at scopes folks.
[08:33.200 --> 08:34.200]  Yeah.
[08:34.200 --> 08:35.200]  Get yourself a, like a jeweler's loop.
[08:35.200 --> 08:38.320]  I have a scope from dino light that hooks up to my computer.
[08:38.640 --> 08:40.840]  I plug it right into the USB slot.
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.240]  It took me just a few minutes to mess with the drivers to make it a link up to my computer.
[08:46.240 --> 08:48.440]  Once it linked up, it was no problem ever.
[08:48.440 --> 08:50.000]  I opened up the application.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.380]  I'm able to run the scope over the plants and I can focus it in and I can see those
[08:54.380 --> 09:00.200]  trichomes very large on my computer screen and it makes it very, and I can take pictures.
[09:00.200 --> 09:03.360]  So if I can't tell exactly what I'm looking at, I can reach over and I think I press F
[09:03.360 --> 09:05.600]  11 and I take a photo right there.
[09:05.600 --> 09:06.600]  Boom.
[09:06.600 --> 09:09.400]  And I can go look later and I can see if that plant's ripe or not.
[09:09.400 --> 09:13.720]  The computerized scope makes life a lot easier, but you can pick up something kind of like
[09:13.720 --> 09:15.000]  a jeweler's loop.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.840]  That's a lot less expensive and just as functional.
[09:17.840 --> 09:19.720]  The four 20 scope will work for you.
[09:19.720 --> 09:22.320]  Just a basic jeweler's loop will work for you.
[09:22.320 --> 09:23.760]  There's one that hydro farm sells.
[09:23.760 --> 09:25.440]  It spreads in half.
[09:25.440 --> 09:28.640]  It's got batteries in it and then it splits in half and the batteries are in one side
[09:28.640 --> 09:31.080]  and the optics are actually on the other side.
[09:31.080 --> 09:32.760]  They make a 60 and a 100 X.
[09:32.760 --> 09:35.800]  I would recommend the hundred X if you go for that.
[09:35.800 --> 09:37.760]  That's probably the best one on the market.
[09:37.760 --> 09:40.840]  If you're going to get something like that, that I'm aware of, there's probably something
[09:40.840 --> 09:42.440]  better by now.
[09:42.440 --> 09:44.800]  But get some magnification.
[09:44.800 --> 09:46.960]  Magnification will help you out in so many ways.
[09:46.960 --> 09:50.600]  You'll be able to tell if your trichomes are clear, if they're silver, if they're cloudy,
[09:50.600 --> 09:53.280]  if they're milky, if they're Amber, if they're ruptured.
[09:53.280 --> 09:57.640]  Also you'll be able to identify the pests and the funguses and the problems on the undersides
[09:57.640 --> 09:59.520]  of your leaves more accurately.
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.520]  If you've got a scope to look at those things.
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.920]  It's a really useful tool throughout the growth cycle for sure.
[10:05.040 --> 10:05.540]  Yeah.
[10:05.540 --> 10:09.400]  Once you've got all of your tools dialed in and you've got some money to spend on a couple
[10:09.400 --> 10:12.280]  of extra toys for the grow room, get yourself a scope.
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.960]  It will really help a scope or a loop or something that hooks up to your computer.
[10:15.960 --> 10:17.080]  All right.
[10:17.080 --> 10:21.080]  So the hairs are not going to tell you how ready your plant is.
[10:21.080 --> 10:22.080]  Mike just tapped his headphones.
[10:22.080 --> 10:23.080]  Are you too hot there?
[10:23.080 --> 10:24.080]  No, I just got an itch.
[10:24.080 --> 10:25.080]  All right.
[10:25.080 --> 10:26.080]  Scratch it up, buddy.
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.080]  Good boy.
[10:27.080 --> 10:28.080]  Good boy.
[10:28.080 --> 10:29.080]  His legs starting to go because he's scratching behind his ear.
[10:29.080 --> 10:30.080]  You guys are twitching.
[10:30.080 --> 10:31.080]  All right.
[10:31.080 --> 10:36.640]  The only thing that's going to tell you if your cannabis plants are ripe are the trichomes.
[10:36.640 --> 10:37.880]  We're growing for trichomes.
[10:37.880 --> 10:38.880]  That's what we want.
[10:38.880 --> 10:41.400]  If you're growing to make quality flowers, if you're going to make edibles, if you're
[10:41.400 --> 10:44.680]  going to make extracts, if you're going to make anything, the trichomes are what matter.
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.520]  So pay attention to that.
[10:46.520 --> 10:47.520]  Nothing else.
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.200]  Now the way that you could tell the trichomes, you're going to see the trichomes develop
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.200]  on your plant.
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.920]  If you have a scope and you can pay attention through the entire process, do that.
[10:56.920 --> 10:59.700]  Watch those trichomes go from a little bitty stock.
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.300]  Watch them develop a head.
[11:01.300 --> 11:04.020]  Watch the head of that trichome fill up.
[11:04.020 --> 11:05.020]  You'll watch it fill up.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.020]  It'll get juicy.
[11:06.020 --> 11:08.380]  And then it'll start to change colors.
[11:08.380 --> 11:09.380]  It'll go from clear.
[11:09.380 --> 11:13.580]  Then it'll slowly turn to like a silverish color.
[11:13.580 --> 11:15.780]  Then it'll get cloudy.
[11:15.780 --> 11:17.260]  Once you see it, you'll know.
[11:17.260 --> 11:20.460]  Right now you're going, what does he mean by cloudy?
[11:20.460 --> 11:24.220]  Imagine if you got a fishbowl and then you put some dish soap in there and stirred it
[11:24.220 --> 11:25.220]  up.
[11:25.220 --> 11:26.220]  It's cloudy.
[11:26.220 --> 11:28.220]  That's what your cloudy trichomes are going to look like.
[11:28.220 --> 11:29.220]  That's cloudy.
[11:29.740 --> 11:32.900]  Now your next step after cloudy is milky.
[11:32.900 --> 11:35.140]  Sometimes they turn kind of bluish in my opinion.
[11:35.140 --> 11:36.500]  They have a hint of blue.
[11:36.500 --> 11:38.140]  They have that.
[11:38.140 --> 11:42.180]  If you stare at like certain white paints and whatnot, you'll start to see a blue kind
[11:42.180 --> 11:43.500]  of undertone a little bit.
[11:43.500 --> 11:44.500]  Yeah.
[11:44.500 --> 11:45.500]  Yeah.
[11:45.500 --> 11:47.540]  And it's a nice patch of milky trichomes.
[11:47.540 --> 11:50.520]  I always see just a little hint of light blue in there.
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.740]  So the fishbowl I talked about a minute ago, imagine if I took your fishbowl that had,
[11:54.740 --> 11:57.420]  we dumped out the dish soap because this is just going to get gross if we keep adding
[11:57.420 --> 11:58.420]  stuff.
[11:58.620 --> 11:59.620]  Let's do this differently.
[11:59.620 --> 12:03.980]  Imagine if you took a fishbowl that's got water in it and you poured just enough milk
[12:03.980 --> 12:08.260]  in there to make it turn light white, light white.
[12:08.260 --> 12:12.020]  It's not going to be fucking boom like ice cream, but it's going to be light white.
[12:12.020 --> 12:14.620]  Like you poured some creamer in your coffee, you just lighten it up.
[12:14.620 --> 12:15.780]  You can see it now.
[12:15.780 --> 12:17.920]  Now that trichome is what I would call milky.
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.140]  That is a milky trichome.
[12:20.140 --> 12:22.540]  You're almost ready for harvest.
[12:22.540 --> 12:27.100]  The next step that's going to happen is going to look like you had a spray bottle.
[12:27.100 --> 12:30.220]  Imagine if I took the little spray bottle that you're spraying your plants with or whatever
[12:30.220 --> 12:32.540]  that little mister bottle.
[12:32.540 --> 12:36.860]  What if I poured some Dr. Pepper in there and I walked right up to your trichomes and
[12:36.860 --> 12:41.660]  just give it a little spritz of Dr. Pepper?
[12:41.660 --> 12:45.620]  Your trichomes are going to have a little amber spritz on them now.
[12:45.620 --> 12:47.820]  That's exactly what I think it looks like.
[12:47.820 --> 12:51.580]  You sprayed some soda right onto your trichomes.
[12:51.580 --> 12:55.660]  They're going to go from milky and then you're going to see just a couple of them get this
[12:55.660 --> 12:59.620]  amber color, this Dr. Pepper color right across them.
[12:59.620 --> 13:03.300]  You're going to see it happen toward the top and right in the middle.
[13:03.300 --> 13:06.500]  Then pay attention to the whole plant because it's going to move around.
[13:06.500 --> 13:10.540]  When you see that first bit of amber, really start paying attention because you've got
[13:10.540 --> 13:13.340]  a very short time now.
[13:13.340 --> 13:17.580]  That amber is going to start progressing throughout the plant really quickly.
[13:17.580 --> 13:22.100]  When you look at the scope and you can see ... You're going to have to look around the
[13:22.100 --> 13:23.100]  plant.
[13:23.100 --> 13:30.460]  When 30% of those trichomes start becoming amber, that's when you want to cut down, 30%.
[13:30.460 --> 13:32.300]  I say look in several places.
[13:32.300 --> 13:36.140]  You're going to be like, 30%, how do I know when I can see 100 trichomes in there?
[13:36.140 --> 13:38.860]  Just look around and use your best judgment, you guys.
[13:38.860 --> 13:43.340]  About 25% to 35% is where you want to aim for.
[13:43.340 --> 13:47.440]  You're not going to notice a difference if you're a few days off on your harvest, honestly.
[13:47.440 --> 13:49.420]  You are not going to notice a huge difference.
[13:49.420 --> 13:51.580]  You've got a dry and cure period.
[13:51.580 --> 13:56.140]  Once you cut down these plants, those trichomes are going to continue to change all the way
[13:56.140 --> 13:58.500]  until the moment you combust them.
[13:58.500 --> 13:59.540]  You're going to cut them down.
[13:59.540 --> 14:01.260]  You've got this dry period.
[14:01.260 --> 14:03.020]  They're going to get beat up in harvest.
[14:03.020 --> 14:04.380]  They're going to get cured.
[14:04.380 --> 14:05.540]  They're going to change.
[14:05.540 --> 14:08.580]  There's going to be so many different changes in those trichomes.
[14:08.580 --> 14:12.260]  Just a couple of days in your harvest window will not make a huge difference.
[14:12.260 --> 14:13.460]  You're not going to notice it.
[14:13.460 --> 14:16.540]  It's not going to hurt your feelings.
[14:16.540 --> 14:17.820]  Pay attention to those trichomes.
[14:17.820 --> 14:19.340]  Get yourself a scope.
[14:19.340 --> 14:20.340]  They're going to go clear.
[14:20.700 --> 14:22.620]  Then they're going to turn silver.
[14:22.620 --> 14:23.900]  Then they're going to get cloudy.
[14:23.900 --> 14:26.820]  That's when it starts getting exciting.
[14:26.820 --> 14:29.980]  They're filling up with trichomes or with cannabinoids now.
[14:29.980 --> 14:33.220]  They've got different things in there, different psychoactive ingredients inside of there that
[14:33.220 --> 14:35.540]  are changing every day.
[14:35.540 --> 14:36.620]  Then they're going to get milky.
[14:36.620 --> 14:38.580]  They're going to turn a little bit blue.
[14:38.580 --> 14:41.220]  Then they're going to look like I sprayed them with Dr. Pepper.
[14:41.220 --> 14:46.260]  When three out of 10, when 30% of them have that Dr. Pepper stain on them, that's when
[14:46.260 --> 14:49.820]  it's time to cut.
[14:49.820 --> 14:53.980]  You're going to say, but it's my first grow with this plant.
[14:53.980 --> 14:54.980]  How do I plan that?
[14:54.980 --> 14:59.900]  How do I properly be able to flush and look out for trichomes to be amber?
[14:59.900 --> 15:03.180]  I thought of a great way that we can all be safe.
[15:03.180 --> 15:07.860]  Keep in mind, this isn't going to be the last time you're growing the strain, hopefully.
[15:07.860 --> 15:09.120]  This is the first time you grew it.
[15:09.120 --> 15:11.440]  That's why you don't know when the trichomes are going to change colors.
[15:11.440 --> 15:12.880]  That's why you don't know how long it's going to take.
[15:12.880 --> 15:13.880]  It's the first time.
[15:13.880 --> 15:16.060]  You're developing a relationship with this plant.
[15:16.060 --> 15:17.420]  The first time, you got to learn it.
[15:17.420 --> 15:19.100]  The second, third time, you dial it in.
[15:19.380 --> 15:22.460]  The fourth and fifth time, you fucking perfect this grow.
[15:22.460 --> 15:24.540]  You're just learning this one.
[15:24.540 --> 15:25.980]  Think about it this way.
[15:25.980 --> 15:32.620]  If you're growing a 60-day plant, if the package says grow it for 55 to 60 days, go that 60
[15:32.620 --> 15:33.620]  days.
[15:33.620 --> 15:37.380]  If you're going to go for 60 days, flush it day 50 and really start paying attention to
[15:37.380 --> 15:38.620]  those trichomes.
[15:38.620 --> 15:43.180]  If you want to cut it down at a specific day, just make sure you flushed seven to 10 days
[15:43.180 --> 15:44.180]  pretty heavily.
[15:44.180 --> 15:48.460]  I'd like to go 14, but seven to 10 days should be plenty.
[15:48.460 --> 15:53.020]  If you want to let your plant go 70 days, if you've got something I bred, you probably
[15:53.020 --> 15:54.420]  want to let it go 70 days.
[15:54.420 --> 15:57.140]  If I bred it, 70 days, no problem.
[15:57.140 --> 16:00.440]  Start flushing at day 60 and pay attention to your trichomes.
[16:00.440 --> 16:01.920]  You can cut down at day 70.
[16:01.920 --> 16:04.360]  If you don't feel like it's ready, let it go a little bit longer.
[16:04.360 --> 16:06.340]  It doesn't need nutrients to keep going.
[16:06.340 --> 16:11.060]  It's just going to start getting tired, but then you can give it time to ripen up.
[16:11.060 --> 16:17.980]  I think the way to judge when to harvest your cannabis is by paying attention to the trichomes.
[16:17.980 --> 16:22.120]  If you don't have a way to look at the trichomes, you don't have a way to accurately judge the
[16:22.120 --> 16:24.180]  ripeness of your cannabis plants.
[16:24.180 --> 16:27.740]  You run the risk of cutting them way too early is what most people do.
[16:27.740 --> 16:30.900]  If you feel like they're done, wait three to five more days.
[16:30.900 --> 16:35.260]  If you can wait seven more days, wait, because they're only going to get better.
[16:35.260 --> 16:38.140]  Don't cut too early because you're anxious and eager.
[16:38.140 --> 16:39.140]  Patience.
[16:39.140 --> 16:40.200]  Patience.
[16:40.200 --> 16:43.340]  You cut clones or you grew from seeds and those took time.
[16:43.340 --> 16:46.740]  Then you veged it out and you spent a lot of money on nutrients you've already spent.
[16:47.060 --> 16:50.180]  You're probably going to put 115 days into it.
[16:50.180 --> 16:51.860]  Why not put 122?
[16:51.860 --> 16:52.860]  What's another week?
[16:52.860 --> 16:54.260]  I know you start getting itchy.
[16:54.260 --> 16:57.500]  You start getting that crackhead lips and you start scratching your neck.
[16:57.500 --> 16:58.820]  You're like, yeah, I want to cut it down.
[16:58.820 --> 17:02.580]  I'm thinking of a friend of mine who was always in that clip in lower nut.
[17:02.580 --> 17:06.860]  You'd start at the bottom of the plant and start taking nugs and drying them out as fast
[17:06.860 --> 17:09.700]  as he could to keep himself covered.
[17:09.700 --> 17:13.900]  By the time he got the harvest, it was just like the top coal is left on the plant.
[17:14.900 --> 17:18.140]  There's nothing to enjoy because you fast dried everything.
[17:18.140 --> 17:22.220]  You could have just had one huge harvest and actually saw a harvest.
[17:22.220 --> 17:25.700]  You could see what it looks like, what your work actually did instead of just destroying
[17:25.700 --> 17:28.460]  your work slowly and not getting any reward.
[17:28.460 --> 17:30.060]  Be patient, you guys.
[17:30.060 --> 17:33.580]  That's one of the main things that it's hard to learn when you're growing cannabis.
[17:33.580 --> 17:35.980]  Sometimes you just need to hide your scissors.
[17:35.980 --> 17:36.980]  Send Mike home with the scissors.
[17:36.980 --> 17:39.500]  Be like, bro, take these so that I can't cut my plants up.
[17:39.500 --> 17:41.740]  You're like, oh, you're on suicide watch or something.
[17:42.140 --> 17:45.900]  Take these, bro, so I can't fuck up.
[17:45.900 --> 17:48.940]  I guess that was a pretty quick way to do it, but that's right to the point.
[17:48.940 --> 17:51.140]  There's no other way to explain that.
[17:51.140 --> 17:55.020]  Get a jeweler's loop, get some sort of magnification, and look at your trichomes.
[17:55.020 --> 17:57.540]  I know I keep saying it, we're growing for trichomes.
[17:57.540 --> 17:59.980]  We don't care about all that leafy green shit.
[17:59.980 --> 18:05.420]  You just got to get in there with some magnification and spend some time reading the plant.
[18:05.420 --> 18:07.540]  We're not worried about all the green leafy part.
[18:07.540 --> 18:10.740]  That part tastes good, that's fun to smoke, that's a cool carrier, but the trichomes are
[18:10.740 --> 18:13.300]  the goal, so make sure they're ripe.
[18:13.300 --> 18:20.340]  Something that I should add, if you are growing for concentrates, maybe cut a little bit early.
[18:20.340 --> 18:25.700]  Start flushing early and harvest a little bit early because if you want nice and clear
[18:25.700 --> 18:28.700]  concentrates, maybe this is some industry secrets I shouldn't be sharing with the general
[18:28.700 --> 18:30.140]  public, but here you go, guys.
[18:30.140 --> 18:31.780]  I love you and this is free.
[18:31.780 --> 18:36.100]  If you want nice and clear concentrates, cut your plants down before the trichomes start
[18:36.100 --> 18:37.300]  getting dark.
[18:37.300 --> 18:41.220]  If they start getting dark, what you're extracting is trichomes.
[18:41.220 --> 18:44.300]  Your concentrates will come out a little bit darker.
[18:44.300 --> 18:46.460]  Cut them down when they're nice and clear, and guess what?
[18:46.460 --> 18:47.660]  Nice and clear concentrates.
[18:47.660 --> 18:48.660]  It's easier.
[18:48.660 --> 18:52.300]  A lot of concentrate makers can make super clear concentrates out of everything now,
[18:52.300 --> 18:53.340]  but it's easier.
[18:53.340 --> 18:57.540]  It's less to clean up, it's less work if you're pulling it down when you have got nice and
[18:57.540 --> 18:58.540]  clear trichomes.
[18:58.540 --> 18:59.860]  Cut early and process quickly.
[18:59.860 --> 19:00.860]  Yep, they cut them down.
[19:00.860 --> 19:02.660]  I don't even want to tell you what week.
[19:02.660 --> 19:06.020]  Sometimes like week seven-ish I've seen it go for concentrates.
[19:06.220 --> 19:10.060]  Yeah, a little bit ridiculous, but then you can pull a whole one more harvest a year.
[19:10.060 --> 19:13.260]  If you cut everything down at the end of week six, then you could fit one more harvest a
[19:13.260 --> 19:16.300]  year in your schedule.
[19:16.300 --> 19:17.380]  That's business, unfortunately.
[19:17.380 --> 19:18.380]  You guys do not do that.
[19:18.380 --> 19:19.380]  Be patient.
[19:19.380 --> 19:20.380]  Let it go long enough.
[19:20.380 --> 19:21.700]  Let it be done.
[19:21.700 --> 19:25.940]  Like Axel Rose said, all we need is just a little patience.
[19:25.940 --> 19:30.060]  All right, Podcast World, I want to thank you once again for listening to this episode
