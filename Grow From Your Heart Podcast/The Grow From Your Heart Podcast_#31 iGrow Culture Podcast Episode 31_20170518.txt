[02:01.640 --> 02:05.080]  Much love to all of our sponsors that make this show possible because they got a whole
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.000]  bunch of news for you. So I'm going to take a big fat dab and I'll be right back with
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.800]  the news. I'm going to keep the video running for you guys watching the YouTube video that
[02:12.800 --> 02:59.310]  I mentioned. I'm going to start putting the shows on YouTube. Taking big fat dabs and
[02:59.310 --> 03:03.030]  I don't have anything to drink next to me. It's kind of a fatal mistake. I owe a big
[03:03.030 --> 03:09.190]  fat shout out to my man TaskRoc. TaskRoc hooked me up with this blue highly educated carb
[03:09.190 --> 03:14.910]  cap. Helps out a lot. Let you get those low temp dabs. Also want to give him a shout out
[03:14.910 --> 03:19.470]  for this nail I've got on my rig. That is a highly educated duality nail. It's one of
[03:19.470 --> 03:23.430]  my favorite nails. It's what I use the most. We're not sponsored by Hitman, but this Hitman
[03:23.430 --> 03:28.950]  rig right here, that's probably the rig I grabbed first when it's time to take dabs.
[03:28.950 --> 03:33.350]  Also sit next to me. I got a backup plan in case it gets dirty. I got the Mad Rob. Big
[03:33.350 --> 03:38.350]  shout out to Mad Rob, support Mad Rob Glass, support Hitman Glass. I don't have any specific
[03:38.350 --> 03:44.310]  glass sponsors, so I can say all their brand names. Big shout out to Solomon. Solomon made
[03:44.310 --> 03:48.590]  me a, I slurred when I said that S. Solomon made me a great Rasta colored rig. I really
[03:48.590 --> 03:52.230]  dig that. All right guys, I'm going to turn down the music. It looks like the music is
[03:52.230 --> 03:56.630]  going to fade out itself. We'll make sure we don't play any more songs. Need to give
[03:56.630 --> 03:59.990]  a big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band. What you're listening to is the doggy dub
[03:59.990 --> 04:06.390]  from the album Constant Struggle. Big huge shout out to Coot Dog and Catherine, some
[04:06.390 --> 04:10.150]  of the coolest people in reggae. All right, let's get down to business. I'm going to fade
[04:10.150 --> 04:14.630]  this out. Fade that out. No more music. All right. It makes it so much easier for me to
[04:14.630 --> 04:21.150]  think and do a show when there is no music going on. That dab worked y'all. All right.
[04:21.150 --> 04:25.590]  So I told you I had a lot of good news going on. If I can get my web browser to open, I
[04:25.590 --> 04:32.630]  will read the great news for the day. It says, Realm of Caring announces Charlotte's web
[04:32.630 --> 04:40.470]  to be shipped to all 50 U.S. states. Now, what the fuck? Oh man, I owe a dollar. What
[04:40.470 --> 04:44.270]  the heck? That's a dollar. Somebody tweet me and remind me that I owe another dollar
[04:44.430 --> 04:49.350]  to that charity. Realm of Caring announces Charlotte's web to be shipped to all 50 U.S.
[04:49.350 --> 04:54.830]  states. Charlotte's web is a kind of popular strain of cannabis that's really high in CBD.
[04:54.830 --> 04:58.390]  And they're going to ship it to all 50 states? That already makes you raise your eyebrows
[04:58.390 --> 05:04.190]  and say WTF? So I'm going to try to quit coughing. Oh look, I have a Gatorade down here that
[05:04.190 --> 05:15.800]  I've spaced out. I'm going to take a sip of this because, dude, I'm choking. All right.
[05:15.800 --> 05:20.360]  So families of Realm of Caring's out-of-state waitlist received emails this week that Charlotte's
[05:20.360 --> 05:27.120]  web hemp oil will now be available for shipping to all 50 states. Something I find weird here.
[05:27.120 --> 05:30.680]  I'm going to have to do more research. It says Charlotte's web hemp oil, and it's got
[05:30.680 --> 05:35.240]  the little trademark symbol right above that. So they've trademarked Charlotte's web hemp
[05:35.240 --> 05:40.440]  oil. The email from Realm of Caring, which will now be referred to as ROC, explains that
[05:40.440 --> 05:44.880]  Charlotte's web product they will be shipping falls within the federally acceptable limit
[05:44.880 --> 05:51.920]  of less than 0.3% of THC for classification as a hemp-derived food product. The email
[05:51.920 --> 05:57.160]  also states that the legality of this product is still ambiguous and recommends the patient
[05:57.160 --> 06:02.320]  sign up for their state's medical marijuana programs to provide your family more protection.
[06:02.320 --> 06:06.960]  However, the organization will ship to patients who have signed up for the waitlist regardless
[06:06.960 --> 06:11.820]  of their home state's cannabis policies and regardless of each individual client's status
[06:11.820 --> 06:18.680]  as a licensed medical cannabis patient. So they have found a loophole. Apparently there
[06:18.680 --> 06:26.300]  is less than 0.3% THC in the Charlotte's web cannabis oil that they're making. Let me call
[06:26.300 --> 06:28.760]  it the right thing because they've trademarked it. We've got to say it right. I got to scroll
[06:28.760 --> 06:34.740]  back up. Where the hell did it go? Oh, Charlotte's web hemp oil. It's right there in the very
[06:34.740 --> 06:40.700]  first sentence. I scrolled down way too far. So they're going to ship it to all 50 states.
[06:40.700 --> 06:44.540]  That means people in Massachusetts. Pick a state that you're afraid of. If you live
[06:44.540 --> 06:50.600]  in a state right now and cannabis is not legal there, you can get this product shipped to
[06:50.600 --> 06:54.380]  you if you were on their waiting list. I don't know how long ago you had to sign up to get
[06:54.380 --> 06:58.860]  on the waiting list, but if you were there, you can get this product now. I find that
[06:58.860 --> 07:03.460]  remarkable. I find that quite ballsy. Ballsy is the word I'm going to use. I find it really
[07:03.460 --> 07:07.020]  compassionate and I really hope this works out. I hope this helps a lot of people. I'm
[07:07.020 --> 07:10.400]  going to continue with the article. Let me give some credit before I get too far. I forgot
[07:10.400 --> 07:18.640]  to give credit to where this article came from. It just says photo by, let's see. I
[07:18.640 --> 07:23.640]  guess it's by Vanessa Waltz medical. Yes. Vanessa Waltz medical news and editorial.
[07:23.640 --> 07:31.560]  All right. Sorry. I should have prepared a little better for that part. So yeah, photos.
[07:31.560 --> 07:34.800]  It's gives photo credit to Vanessa Waltz and I'm pretty sure that the article is from her
[07:34.800 --> 07:39.320]  also. I actually, this was tweeted to me by my friend on Twitter. What's up white Mike.
[07:39.320 --> 07:43.520]  Thanks for tweeting that. Uh, he's Nikon and Nemo punk on Twitter. I'm not sure which
[07:43.520 --> 07:47.640]  is which it's either at Nikon or at Nemo punk here. Let's just be diligent and go look at
[07:47.640 --> 07:50.440]  that for you. And then I promise I'll get back into the article. I just want to give
[07:50.440 --> 07:54.240]  my credit cause he hooked me up here. This was really something I was glad to see because
[07:54.240 --> 07:58.440]  we see all kinds of bad news all the time, right? That's good to see some great shit.
[07:58.440 --> 08:03.800]  I'm going through as quick as I can on Twitter. So it's Nikon and I see on, but he has at
[08:03.800 --> 08:09.880]  Nemo punk 15 at N E M O P U N K 15. So give him a shout out for me. Tell him that you
[08:09.880 --> 08:13.840]  appreciate hearing his story that he sent me on the news here. All right. I'm going
[08:13.840 --> 08:20.120]  to scroll back down. Uh, the cost of the oil will be $250 per bottle, which is equal to,
[08:20.120 --> 08:27.040]  uh, 5 cents per milligram of CBD. So there are pros and cons of the new development and
[08:27.040 --> 08:32.600]  an explanation of why it's likely to be quite different than the R S H O CBD debacle. We're
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.920]  going to have to, there's that's got a link to it. So we're going to check out the RSO
[08:37.920 --> 08:45.040]  R S H O CBD debacle. We're going to read that link also open Lincoln, new tab and open Lincoln
[08:45.040 --> 08:50.920]  new tab. I wonder if that's the same thing. We're going to read those also. Sorry guys,
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.720]  I'm rambling because I took a couple of dabs and I just wanted to get this news out. Mike
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.120]  sent me this and I just wanted to get on the mic and read it. So according to ROC, the
[08:59.120 --> 09:05.360]  oil will test at a consistent 30 to one ratio and the THC will be lower than the 0.3% allowed
[09:05.360 --> 09:11.720]  for food products under federal law. While naysayers may question why this may, uh, why
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.760]  this is any more legal than RSHOs products. It is critical to remember that RSHO has been
[09:16.760 --> 09:22.920]  tested numerous times by independent laboratories, finding contents in excess of 1% THC, which
[09:22.920 --> 09:28.600]  is undeniably illegal under federal law and in non-medical States. We can only hope that
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.760]  ROC is testing and quality control will be far more reliable than RSHOs based on ROC
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.600]  established track record with products already available in Colorado and California. This
[09:39.600 --> 09:45.040]  is likely to be the case, although maintaining a consistent ratio of 30 to one will undoubtedly
[09:45.040 --> 09:49.640]  be challenging for the company's growers and extraction staff. So guys, I've been seeing
[09:49.640 --> 09:57.160]  a lot of initials here, this RSHO let's go see what that is. Um, RSHO, not a normal reaction
[09:57.160 --> 10:05.960]  to cannabis. So this is a product that shows a bottle. It looks like nature supplement.
[10:05.960 --> 10:10.760]  There's some in a syringe, like an oral syringe. And then there's some in a bottle it's 18%
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.520]  CBD. And I'm going to read just this little quick article that comes from, I'll give you
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.720]  some credit who wrote it. It looks like another Vanessa Waltz article, uh, in the wake of
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.880]  reports of serious gastrointestinal effects from the real scientific hemp oil, uh, real
[10:25.880 --> 10:32.520]  scientific hemp oil. So it's, uh, it's a controversial product and people are claiming
[10:32.520 --> 10:36.600]  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. People are saying that's a normal effect. So I don't know anything
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.360]  about that. I can't argue that from taking this product from saying if that's a good
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.160]  effect or not. Um, okay. It's just another competing product. We're just going to go
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.040]  back to the article. I just wanted to make sure we knew what that was. Also. I said the
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.800]  CBD debacle. I clicked that link. Let's see what that's about. It's another go figure.
[10:55.800 --> 11:03.950]  It's another Vanessa Waltz article. That's just another article about marketing CBD. So we're
[11:03.950 --> 11:07.230]  going to see a lot of that stuff because it's going to get really, really popular or it is
[11:07.230 --> 11:12.030]  getting really, really popular. Apparently I'll continue with the article as far as the feds
[11:12.030 --> 11:18.910]  coming down with ROC. Uh, Oh, as far as the feds coming down on ROC with a question mark,
[11:18.910 --> 11:23.390]  that's actually a question. So we're supposed to say it like as far as the feds coming down on ROC,
[11:24.430 --> 11:28.350]  that would be an extremely poor PR move on the federal government's part with all the hype
[11:28.350 --> 11:33.070]  generated by Sanjay Gupta, CNN specials and the widespread media coverage on CBD, a federal
[11:33.070 --> 11:36.990]  crackdown on Charlotte's web would cause a huge uproar. And the feds surely know this
[11:37.550 --> 11:42.270]  arresting and prosecuting the self-proclaimed Christian CBD providers from ROC would spurn
[11:42.270 --> 11:47.230]  entirely different public response than the arrest and prosecution of our SHOs leaders,
[11:47.230 --> 11:51.950]  many of whom have already faced charges from the sec and other federal agencies.
[11:51.950 --> 11:57.310]  My guess is that ROC is essentially untouchable and unimpeachable in this venture.
[11:59.950 --> 12:04.670]  As for the negative side, the most basic and critical flaw is that 30 to one oil is unlikely
[12:04.670 --> 12:09.790]  to help most epileptic children. Anecdotal reports from Colorado families using the higher ratio of
[12:09.790 --> 12:15.550]  Charlotte's web, which has reportedly tested as high as 48 to one CBD to THC indicate that their
[12:15.550 --> 12:20.430]  children are either switching to other products to maintain seizure control or supplementing
[12:20.430 --> 12:25.310]  Charlotte's web with higher THC products available through Colorado's medical cannabis program.
[12:25.310 --> 12:30.110]  This THC supplementation in addition to mail order Charlotte's web is a viable option for
[12:30.110 --> 12:33.790]  children and other medical states who have previously been unable to find consistent
[12:33.790 --> 12:39.150]  sources of clean, well-tested CBD products. And in non-medical states, it is certainly easier to
[12:39.150 --> 12:45.630]  find THC for supplementation in the underground black market than it is to find CBD oils or clones.
[12:47.390 --> 12:52.590]  Yeah, I was thinking about that the whole time I was reading this. It's just CBD. What about that
[12:52.590 --> 12:59.790]  entourage effect we've talked about so many times? We got to get that whole myriad of CBD, THC, THCV.
[13:00.510 --> 13:05.710]  What about the terpenoids that we're missing? I think all of it does it together. And they're
[13:05.710 --> 13:09.550]  saying that they're actually trying, they're needing to supplement with some higher THC
[13:09.550 --> 13:15.790]  products because the CBD is not working completely. It's probably helping. It's, you know, just like
[13:15.790 --> 13:20.750]  any medication that you would take or anything new you would introduce to your body, the first few
[13:20.750 --> 13:25.790]  times you consume or take that, you're going to notice a stronger reaction. And after anything,
[13:25.790 --> 13:31.470]  a few times, a few times, you're going to quit feeling as strong of an effect. So I'm pretty
[13:31.470 --> 13:36.830]  sure that the CBD does work for a while, maybe for a long time for some people, maybe forever
[13:36.830 --> 13:41.390]  for some, but some people you're going to need that THC. I think I've repeated and rambled about
[13:41.390 --> 13:46.350]  that long enough. So let me wrap up the last paragraph here. In short, there should be a
[13:46.350 --> 13:51.230]  positive step in the war on cannabis. At the very least, it should force federal opinion on the
[13:51.230 --> 13:55.950]  legality of CBD hemp products. It will likely benefit some number of patients, especially those
[13:55.950 --> 14:01.870]  who were able to supplement with THC. And unlike the CBD only legislation that has been pushed by
[14:01.870 --> 14:07.710]  ROC, the shipping of Charlotte's Web is unlikely to have a negative impact on future whole plant
[14:07.710 --> 14:12.590]  legislation. While the concept of trademarking a plant and hoarding a strain still rubs many
[14:12.590 --> 14:17.790]  patients and industry insiders the wrong way. The bottom line is that more patients will soon be
[14:17.790 --> 14:23.470]  able to access CBD rich oil without having to move to realm of caring States. And that's a good thing.
[14:24.270 --> 14:28.030]  Uh, this lady seems to know what she's talking about. I want to, if you guys want somebody to
[14:28.030 --> 14:30.750]  follow cool on Twitter, I don't know if she has a Twitter account. Let's read about it. There's a
[14:30.750 --> 14:35.790]  little article about Vanessa Waltz. Vanessa Waltz is a writer, artist, and marijuana reform advocate
[14:35.790 --> 14:41.070]  living in New Mexico. She graduated. Okay. Um, check her out, dude. Vanessa Waltz. She seems to
[14:41.070 --> 14:45.710]  have a good head on her shoulders when it comes to marijuana cannabis. Uh, that's one thing we
[14:45.710 --> 14:48.670]  got to do. We got to quit saying marijuana and say cannabis all the time. I just kept reading
[14:48.670 --> 14:59.390]  the word marijuana and now it's in my head. So, uh, yeah, one brand only Charlotte's web. There's
[14:59.390 --> 15:04.030]  hoarding this screen. If you've got Charlotte's web or high CBD medicine, share that stuff,
[15:04.030 --> 15:08.110]  get that out there, grow clones of that. If you live in a legal state, cut a lot of clones.
[15:08.990 --> 15:12.670]  Whenever you cut clones, get to your plant count, cut that many clones,
[15:13.710 --> 15:17.950]  give those out. If you have extras, you know what I'm saying? Sorry. I'm thinking too many thoughts
[15:17.950 --> 15:23.710]  at once right now trying to do a show and ramble. So if you've got clones of CBD medicine, put those
[15:23.710 --> 15:27.630]  out there. So I'm saying, because we don't want these companies taking over all that shit. Why do
[15:27.630 --> 15:33.710]  we want a company in charge of that? That doesn't seem that's why we're, that's why most of us are
[15:33.710 --> 15:38.190]  smoking medical cannabis anyways, because we don't want a company getting rich off of us or a company
[15:38.190 --> 15:42.830]  telling us what we can and cannot consume. So I'm going to move on to the next article because I
[15:42.830 --> 15:47.390]  feel like I'm ranting super dabbed out. I got to quit getting so high on these episodes. It's kind
[15:47.390 --> 15:52.670]  of fun to tell you the truth. It's my show and I'll get high if I want to. This article, remember
[15:52.670 --> 15:59.390]  a little while back, we talked about a police officer who gave out a whole bunch of tickets,
[15:59.390 --> 16:05.550]  66 citations in Seattle. He was the main guy giving out all the pot tickets. We gave him the
[16:05.550 --> 16:12.270]  big middle finger. Here's another article that came from Seattle. The credit goes to the Associated
[16:12.270 --> 16:17.390]  Press. It says Seattle's police chief has asked the city to seek dismissal of all marijuana
[16:17.390 --> 16:22.670]  citations issued by the bicycle officer who wrote 80% of the tickets handed out during the first
[16:22.670 --> 16:29.710]  half of this year for using pot in public. Seattle Times reports that chief Kathleen O'Toole said
[16:29.710 --> 16:34.590]  Friday, the request to the city attorney's office stems from a conclusion that the 66 citations
[16:34.590 --> 16:39.310]  were written as part of the officer's personal agenda. O'Toole says the tickets were written
[16:39.310 --> 16:46.670]  for the wrong reason. The bicycle officer wrote 66 of the 83 such tickets issued in the first
[16:46.670 --> 16:53.470]  half of the year of the city. This dude wrote 66 of 83 tickets in the first half of the year. So,
[16:53.470 --> 16:58.510]  in six months, every month, this dude busted, wrote 11 tickets for people smoking pot.
[17:00.830 --> 17:05.230]  The officer wrote on one citation that he used a coin toss to decide which of two men got the
[17:05.230 --> 17:12.270]  ticket. And on another described state voter approval of marijuana legalization as silly.
[17:13.470 --> 17:19.710]  What he freaking, he wrote on the citation that he used a coin to decide which two guys got the
[17:19.710 --> 17:25.150]  ticket. How can cops get away with that? He wrote it on the ticket. I guess he's not. He's,
[17:25.150 --> 17:29.550]  they're trying to make him not count now. They're trying to say, ha, your tickets don't count.
[17:29.550 --> 17:32.750]  Wouldn't that be a big middle finger if the authorities gave the authority a big middle
[17:32.750 --> 17:37.550]  finger like that? I like it. The Times says the officer has apologized to O'Toole. She is
[17:37.550 --> 17:43.550]  reportedly still considering disciplinary action. The city attorney Pete Holmes spokeswoman Kimberly
[17:43.550 --> 17:48.750]  Mills says Holmes will review the chief's request. Initiative 502 approved by Washington voters
[17:48.750 --> 17:56.510]  included a civil fine for public consumption of marijuana. So, we kind of got some people on our
[17:56.510 --> 18:01.150]  side because they let that cop, they're going to, they may let that cop's tickets slide. That'll be
[18:01.150 --> 18:07.230]  kind of neat. I'm scrolling through the next to the next article. They were talking about in
[18:07.230 --> 18:13.550]  Denver about banning BHO extraction and banning certain types of extractions without being in a
[18:13.550 --> 18:20.030]  licensed facility or what they would call a MIPS. I think that is to be a little more accurate.
[18:20.030 --> 18:23.150]  Sorry, I'm checking too many things on the computer. The video is going, the recording is
[18:23.150 --> 18:28.590]  going and I'm on the right website. Dude, we are golden tonight. For as many dabs as we took,
[18:28.670 --> 18:34.110]  this is working out pretty well. All right. So, this says some exemptions and proposed
[18:34.110 --> 18:40.830]  Denver restrictions on making home hash oil. So, it says alcohol-based extraction process
[18:40.830 --> 18:45.870]  would join water and food-based methods as acceptable in Denver City Council Committee's
[18:45.870 --> 18:52.430]  planned ordinance. This article is by John Murray from the Denver Post. It says Denver City Council
[18:52.430 --> 18:57.470]  Committee Tuesday delayed proposed restrictions on home hash oil production so that they could
[18:57.470 --> 19:03.550]  be amended to accommodate residents who use an alcohol-based process. Sorry, shit's falling over
[19:03.550 --> 19:08.350]  on the table here. Not even sure what's happening. That was weird. Several people argued for the
[19:08.350 --> 19:12.510]  change to the Safety and Wellbeing Committee, including the father of a little girl who
[19:12.510 --> 19:17.710]  depends on cannabis oil to treat her severe epilepsy. The committee will resume the discussion
[19:17.710 --> 19:23.950]  on the proposed ordinance or could vote October 16th on whether to send it to the full council.
[19:24.670 --> 19:30.750]  The proposal would ban the amateur use of butane or other gases in extractions of oil for marijuana.
[19:31.310 --> 19:36.990]  That's resulted in dozens of home explosions statewide this year. Licensed businesses still
[19:36.990 --> 19:44.110]  could use that process, but people who make hash oil at home would have to use safe water and food-based methods.
[19:44.990 --> 19:58.670]  This is going to have two different effects. People do shit that's illegal anyway, so I don't think that people are going to stop doing it. It's just going to make it a little sketchier.
[19:58.670 --> 20:08.110]  Now that's going to cause more people sneaking around doing it. You have to do it in a little more sketchy place, which means you're a little more enclosed, which is the dangerous part of it.
[20:09.070 --> 20:20.910]  Also, I think it's going to make the street value of BHO dabs go up. Already right now, dabs are getting hard to find around here, and the prices are going up really high. It's because they're making rules like this.
[20:21.950 --> 20:28.110]  I agree. I don't want some uneducated dude next door in his garage making hash while I'm sitting here
[20:28.110 --> 20:32.190]  trying to record a podcast. I don't need the next door house blowing up and screwing up all of our
[20:32.190 --> 20:42.590]  lives. I guess it's the adult in me, the parent in me, the freaking smart guy says we should not be blasting like that.
[20:44.110 --> 20:49.310]  That's kind of cool, dude. We got to get the shops, or we got to figure out a way
[20:49.870 --> 20:55.390]  that we can get some kind of private caregivers to be able to blast it. If we build our own rooms,
[20:56.510 --> 21:01.870]  if I have OSHA come and build me a blast safe room, can I make it in there then maybe, please?
[21:02.590 --> 21:07.550]  There has to be some kind of exception because the shops are charging way too much right now for
[21:07.550 --> 21:12.110]  shatter. A lot of it is shit, to tell you the truth. I wouldn't dab a lot of the hash that
[21:12.110 --> 21:16.350]  I've seen come from the shops. I am a little bit of a hash snob, to tell you the truth,
[21:16.350 --> 21:21.790]  but I don't want to dab a lot of that shit. Let me show you. I've got a camera going here.
[21:21.790 --> 21:27.230]  Guys, I'll post some pictures of this. I'm kind of working on putting up YouTube videos. This got hot.
[21:27.310 --> 21:29.870]  I can't see what I'm doing. Let me switch to the video. This got hot in the car,
[21:30.910 --> 21:37.150]  but this is some golden goat shatter right here. It should be nice and stable. It shouldn't be
[21:37.150 --> 21:43.470]  goopy, soupy, and poopy. Then I'm going to contradict myself by showing you some live
[21:43.470 --> 21:47.390]  resin that is a little bit gooey, but this is a different product. This isn't shatter.
[21:47.390 --> 21:54.910]  We're not marketing this as shatter. This is live resin. See how golden and clear that is, brah?
[21:55.390 --> 21:59.710]  That's just ... We've talked about live resin. It's fresh, frozen, butane-blasted,
[21:59.710 --> 22:03.550]  buds done in a closed loop. Shout out to the guy that did it for me. He knows what's up. He knows
[22:03.550 --> 22:06.990]  who he is. I don't know if I should say his name on the show right now. Good work. That shit's
[22:06.990 --> 22:12.510]  golden, really golden-looking, but the shops are charging too much for doo-doo, and that sucks.
[22:12.510 --> 22:16.750]  They have to let the artists, the extract artists that know what they're doing, the people that
[22:17.950 --> 22:22.110]  led this movement, the guys that make everything happen. Not everything. Sorry,
[22:22.110 --> 22:26.510]  I'm adjusting a camera over here while I'm rambling. The guys that have evolved all this
[22:26.510 --> 22:30.110]  hash stuff, they've done the research, they've done the work. We need to be able to do it in
[22:30.110 --> 22:37.310]  a safe manner. I know that open blasting is not a safe manner. I wonder if this is ... Let's see.
[22:37.310 --> 22:39.790]  Is this going to have anything to do with the guys with the closed loop system?
[22:41.070 --> 22:46.910]  Let's scroll through this article one quick time and see. Would ban amateur use of propane or other
[22:46.910 --> 22:51.630]  gases and extraction of oil from ... Yeah, that fucking says closed loop system or not, I think,
[22:51.630 --> 22:55.630]  in the way that that's worded. We're going to have to be careful, because I know a few guys
[22:55.630 --> 22:58.510]  that have invested in a closed loop system thinking that that would solve the problem,
[22:58.510 --> 23:02.110]  and now look, they're changing the rules right around you. All right, I'm going to get back into
[23:02.110 --> 23:06.110]  the article. It says, Brian Wilson, whose family moved from New Jersey to Denver earlier this year,
[23:06.110 --> 23:10.190]  so his three-year-old daughter Vivian could use medical marijuana treatments, said neither of
[23:10.190 --> 23:14.590]  those methods will produce the kind of oil suitable for her. He uses an ethanol-based
[23:14.590 --> 23:21.230]  extraction process. I didn't move I here to put her at more risk, Wilson said. Denver Fire Chief
[23:21.710 --> 23:28.750]  Eric Tate told the committee that the proposal likely could be amended to allow alcohol-based
[23:28.750 --> 23:36.110]  methods with limits on use of heat and amount of alcohol to keep it safe. I guess if ... Man,
[23:36.110 --> 23:39.710]  I don't like rules and stuff, but I don't like fires and explosions either. If I have a choice,
[23:39.710 --> 23:45.470]  a couple of rules or a couple of fires, the Rastafari in me says, fuck the rules, I owe a
[23:45.470 --> 23:51.550]  dollar. But the other part of me says, I don't like fire. Let me explain why I keep saying that
[23:51.550 --> 23:57.630]  I need a dollar if you're not a common listener, what's a regular listener, what's the phrase for
[23:57.630 --> 24:03.630]  that? Yeah, regular listener, I guess. Every time I say the F word, I owe a dollar.
[24:04.510 --> 24:07.790]  And there's a charity, there's a guy, he's not a charity, it's a sick person,
[24:07.790 --> 24:11.390]  sick child that will get my dollars. Every time I say the F word, you guys have to tweet me,
[24:11.390 --> 24:14.510]  tell me when I said it, tell me how many times in this episode I said it.
[24:15.470 --> 24:19.150]  It starts on episode 30, this is 31. So you got two episodes where you can make some money off me.
[24:20.590 --> 24:24.030]  After a couple episodes, if I don't stop saying the F word, I'm going to increase the dollar
[24:24.030 --> 24:27.790]  amount. I'll go from a dollar, then I'll be like, all right, now I'm going to ... Not now,
[24:27.790 --> 24:31.790]  I'm not saying this, but hypothetically in the future, I'll start charging myself $5 for every
[24:31.790 --> 24:36.590]  time I say the F word. And then if I still don't stop, I'll charge 10 bucks, and then
[24:36.590 --> 24:40.110]  it's going to start costing me money and money counts and I don't want to say the F word on the
[24:40.110 --> 24:43.790]  show and I don't want to pay money. So it's going to work together. I'm rambling tonight, guys,
[24:43.790 --> 24:48.990]  that's why I got behind the mic. I got this cool news about people sending CBD oil. I want your
[24:48.990 --> 24:54.830]  comments about the CBD oil story. Tweet me that. I'm going to take a drink right quick, you guys.
[24:55.630 --> 25:07.110]  Give me a second. I'm not even going to edit this part. All right.
[25:09.990 --> 25:16.390]  Okay. This article, I said I had good news. This one isn't the greatest of news, but it's news.
[25:17.350 --> 25:24.550]  It says it's from the Denver Post. It doesn't give a reporter a name. Nope. It says,
[25:24.550 --> 25:28.550]  seven people are now named as plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against the company accused
[25:28.550 --> 25:32.390]  on giving people samples of marijuana-laced chocolate at the Denver County Fair's Pot
[25:32.390 --> 25:39.190]  Pavilion, which was supposed to be drug-free. The suit filed August 25th in Denver District
[25:39.270 --> 25:50.310]  Court by law firm Frescona, Joyner, Goodman, and Greenstein alleges that representatives of Beyond
[25:50.310 --> 25:56.550]  Broadway LLC doing business as both Full Melt Chocolate and Live Well handed out the chocolate
[25:56.550 --> 26:02.390]  on August 1st through 3rd. The suit is open to all people served THC chocolates by Beyond Broadway
[26:02.390 --> 26:11.270]  LLC at the fair. Oh, man. We talked about this a little while back. There was a Pot Pavilion at
[26:11.270 --> 26:16.390]  the Denver County Fair. They had a joint rolling contest where actually they rolled oregano instead
[26:16.390 --> 26:19.750]  of rolling pot, but they had a joint rolling contest. They had a lot of stuff going on.
[26:19.750 --> 26:23.670]  They actually had a pot growing competition offsite where people had to grow their pot,
[26:23.670 --> 26:26.230]  and then people would go look at it somewhere else because they didn't want it there.
[26:26.950 --> 26:31.830]  You were not supposed to bring any pot products to this fair. That's not what was supposed to
[26:31.830 --> 26:41.030]  happen, but Full Melt handed out some chocolate bars, and people ate them, and seven people are
[26:41.030 --> 26:49.510]  now named as plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against these guys. Imagine, and we had this talk
[26:49.510 --> 26:54.310]  a little while back on the show, but imagine if you were not a pot smoker. Some of you listening
[26:54.310 --> 26:59.430]  to this show may not be pot smokers. Some of you may be amateur pot smokers. Some of you I know
[26:59.430 --> 27:05.750]  only have smoked a little while. Some of you can only smoke very occasionally. If you eat 100
[27:05.750 --> 27:13.430]  milligram edible, you're going to get really high. Imagine if you went to the fair, and you're just
[27:13.430 --> 27:16.790]  hanging out, and someone's like, you want to try this chocolate, man? You're like, does it have
[27:16.790 --> 27:22.390]  weed in it? No. You're like, I believe you. You work for this company, and you've got the apron
[27:22.390 --> 27:26.470]  on that says the company, and you're behind the booth. I believe you. You eat the chocolate,
[27:26.470 --> 27:31.510]  right? Probably 45 minutes later, you're just shitting your pants because you're too high.
[27:31.510 --> 27:36.230]  Oh, man. Imagine that. You've got to try to drive home. The weird part of the head trip of it,
[27:36.230 --> 27:40.390]  in my opinion, is you don't realize that you ate something that was going to make you feel
[27:40.390 --> 27:45.430]  intoxicated, so now you're tripping a little bit because you're high, right? You're starting to
[27:45.430 --> 27:50.470]  feel whatever. Whatever comes on first, you get the tingles in your arms, and then things are a
[27:50.470 --> 27:55.910]  little funny, and you start giggling, but you don't know why. Now, you really don't know why
[27:55.910 --> 27:59.910]  because you didn't realize you ate the shit, so you're like, I'm retarded now. You think you just
[27:59.910 --> 28:04.550]  fucking your brain is flipping out. I owe another dollar. Get me on it. Hey, shout out to Dreadful
[28:04.550 --> 28:09.830]  J. What's up, mama? You remind me every time I say the F word, and I appreciate it. Keep those
[28:09.830 --> 28:14.230]  Instagram pictures coming, guys. Follow Dreadful J on Instagram. She's a badass woman. She makes
[28:14.230 --> 28:20.710]  some good hash. She's an awesome lady. Check her out, but imagine you'd just be tripping, dude.
[28:21.670 --> 28:25.910]  And what if you had your kids with you? What if you were with your mom? What if you have a job?
[28:25.910 --> 28:32.230]  Oh, what if you have a job, dude, where they drug test you? What if you were a reporter that was on
[28:32.230 --> 28:36.630]  the clock? See, this could have caused a lot of problems. We shouldn't talk too much about it
[28:36.630 --> 28:39.030]  because I guess there's a court case, and somebody could hear what I'm saying and be like, yeah,
[28:39.030 --> 28:43.270]  that is fucked up. I didn't realize that. I owe another goddamned dollar. This is going to be an
[28:43.270 --> 28:49.430]  expensive episode. So, seven people are going to make a lot of money off of Full Melt Chocolate
[28:49.430 --> 28:55.430]  and Live Well. Guys, so be careful. If you ever go to a fair or an event, and they're handing out
[28:55.430 --> 28:58.950]  cannabis chocolates, and you're a lightweight, or you're not aware of what you're getting,
[28:58.950 --> 29:02.790]  ask carefully. And then I guess if you get the wrong shit, sue the hell out of them.
[29:04.070 --> 29:08.790]  I probably wouldn't if you did it to me, but if you gave my daughter a medicated chocolate and
[29:08.790 --> 29:12.550]  told her that it was a regular chocolate, that's, I'm definitely, you're going to, yeah, there's
[29:12.550 --> 29:17.430]  going to be at least a court case. It might be against me for me reacting to that shit, but
[29:17.430 --> 29:20.230]  hopefully I can maintain, and we'll do it properly, and just sue the shit out of you.
[29:21.350 --> 29:24.790]  Oh, guys, I've been rambling for, let's see, let's go look at the clock, see how long I've
[29:24.790 --> 29:29.350]  been going on, because I might have to pee here. I'll do, it's coming right up on 30 minutes.
[29:29.350 --> 29:32.470]  So, I'm going to fade out. We'll be back, and we'll do another segment right after this. I'm
[29:32.470 --> 29:37.750]  going to dab and use the little boy's room. Thanks for listening to me ramble a lot tonight, guys.
[29:37.750 --> 29:41.430]  Video watchers, I don't know what I'm going to do for this part. I'll just keep the video rolling,
[29:41.430 --> 29:45.510]  and we'll figure it out in a minute. All right, guys, I am back. While I was gone,
[29:45.510 --> 29:49.830]  I turned on the email, and I grabbed myself a bottle of water. So, I think I'm going to survive.
[29:50.710 --> 29:56.710]  Speaking of the email, let's take a big fat hit out of this. I'm using my blue, highly educated
[29:56.710 --> 30:01.190]  carb cap. I need to clean this thing. Guys, keep your carb cap clean. It will help you out a lot.
[30:01.990 --> 30:07.750]  Dropping it onto the infinity nail with an email wrapped around it, off of an old school rig that,
[30:07.750 --> 30:11.590]  I like this one because it's sturdy enough to hold up the email. That's why I use this one. So,
[30:11.590 --> 30:16.390]  here we go. Big fat dab. Let's do it. It's not really a big fat dab. I just need to be
[30:16.390 --> 30:47.580]  able to talk. So, I do a little one on the show. All right, that'll do it. I noticed that dab.
[30:52.600 --> 30:55.960]  All right. So, I've mentioned a couple of times that I'm doing a video on this episode.
[30:56.920 --> 31:03.000]  I'm trying to go through all of the old episodes and just make really cheesy iMovie videos so that
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.160]  they can be up on YouTube so that people that don't have an iPhone or don't have Stitcher or
[31:07.160 --> 31:12.200]  whatever who are more simple and more familiar with the YouTube, well, it'll just give us another
[31:12.200 --> 31:15.800]  way to be listened. So, I'm going to go through the show up on YouTube. There'll be really simple
[31:15.800 --> 31:21.240]  videos at first. I'll learn how to make better videos as time goes by. The first few will be
[31:21.240 --> 31:26.840]  cheesy, I promise you. The first two are goofy. I made them last night. Might have been medicated.
[31:28.120 --> 31:33.640]  Might have been really medicated. I've been taking dabs of this golden goat and you can't sleep
[31:33.640 --> 31:36.840]  after you dab this golden goat. So, you just got to open your computer and just go nuts because
[31:36.840 --> 31:42.440]  you don't really want to do anything important when you're that dabbed. So, I'm recording this
[31:42.440 --> 31:46.840]  one. I'm just staring into my MacBook with the camera going and just recording me. What's up,
[31:46.840 --> 31:52.200]  if you're checking it out right now. I may just post that to YouTube, but you got 30 episodes
[31:52.200 --> 31:57.960]  to figure that one out. So, it'll be up there eventually. I might go out of order. You never
[31:57.960 --> 32:02.120]  know with us. You never know with me. I just wanted to jump on here and record because I
[32:02.120 --> 32:06.360]  got that really cool tweet about that article that Mike sent me. I had to tell you about that.
[32:06.920 --> 32:11.560]  I wanted to talk about the video. Of course, I am the guy from I read genetic seeds. A lot of people
[32:11.560 --> 32:16.520]  have been asking me when will certain things be back in stock at Nature's Green Remedies.
[32:18.200 --> 32:23.880]  They're sold out because I'm sold out. You guys cleaned me the heck out of seeds. I really
[32:23.880 --> 32:30.840]  appreciate it. I promise you I'm working on more stuff. I've got more Grateful Dog. There'll be a
[32:30.840 --> 32:36.680]  little bit of Grateful Dog. That one doesn't make a lot of seeds. It's harder to get seeds out of
[32:37.080 --> 32:41.240]  a lot of the others. There'll be a lot of Bounty Killer. There'll be a lot of Capleton. There'll
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.200]  be a little bit of Heart of Gold. There will be some Kalonji. There may be a little bit of Night
[32:46.200 --> 32:52.280]  Nurse. A lot of what I make goes to the people around here before it makes it to Nature's Green
[32:52.280 --> 32:58.440]  Remedies. It goes to other places before it gets there. I take care of the locals first. I take
[32:58.440 --> 33:02.280]  care of the people around me, my patients, I'm a caregiver. Those guys get the seeds first that I
[33:02.280 --> 33:07.000]  make. Then I put what I have on Nature's Green Remedies when they order from me. I let them know
[33:07.000 --> 33:12.360]  when I have stuff. They'll order it. Then they'll put it on the website, guys. It's going to be,
[33:12.360 --> 33:22.200]  honestly, I'm coughing and counting. We're looking at about probably 75 to 90 days-ish.
[33:22.200 --> 33:26.440]  I don't want to make any huge promises. There should be some stuff on Nature's Green Remedies,
[33:26.440 --> 33:31.240]  maybe 100 days. I'm going to say because I need packaging time and all that stuff, drying time.
[33:32.520 --> 33:36.200]  Right around 100 days, there should be some stuff available from Iry Genetics, again,
[33:36.200 --> 33:41.000]  at naturesgreenremedies.com. I apologize for not being able to keep them in stock.
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.080]  Honestly, it's kind of a good sign that they're sold out. That means I'd be doing shit right.
[33:46.200 --> 33:53.080]  Also, I have a forum. Irygeneticscolorado.com has a forum. If you go to Irygeneticscolorado.com,
[33:53.080 --> 33:57.960]  you can check out our genetics. It is a work in progress. I don't run the website. It's my
[33:57.960 --> 34:03.080]  buddy Tony. He's a college student. He's a working man. We put together the website late
[34:03.080 --> 34:08.040]  at night when we're chilling out. Check it out. Please support that. Join the forum. If you have
[34:08.040 --> 34:13.480]  questions, we will answer your questions. Some of the stuff from the show comes from the forum,
[34:13.480 --> 34:17.160]  and some of the stuff from the show goes onto the forum. It's kind of a little way to be
[34:17.160 --> 34:22.040]  interactive if you guys want to participate. Also, speaking of participation, you can follow us.
[34:22.040 --> 34:27.640]  Please follow us. Follow I Grow Culture on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Also,
[34:27.640 --> 34:31.720]  follow Irygenetics on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. That would be really cool.
[34:33.880 --> 34:37.720]  Coming up in the future, I know we said that we were going to do an episode about curing your
[34:37.720 --> 34:44.120]  cannabis. That's definitely going to happen. Jesse and I are working on that. We want to put together
[34:44.120 --> 34:48.760]  better episodes for you guys who are taking our time and going slow. This may just be like a
[34:48.760 --> 34:53.000]  midweek booster episode, just kind of me hanging out dabbing. I was eager to get a show out.
[34:54.520 --> 34:59.160]  Man, I don't have a lot else to say. I got to give a couple of shout outs. Shout out to
[34:59.720 --> 35:04.360]  Koot and Kat and the entire Mystic Roots band. Make sure you check out the Mystic Roots band.
[35:05.800 --> 35:10.440]  Big shout out to Taskrock and Highly Educated Titanium. Big super shout out to the entire
[35:10.440 --> 35:15.800]  Garden of Weeden crew. Big shout out to Jesse. Big shout out to Atmis Green Thumb. Also, a shout
[35:15.800 --> 35:22.920]  out to HippieNurse710 and a shout out to Angela. I'm going to wrap up the show and we do this part.
[35:22.920 --> 35:27.000]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes. Go to the iTunes store, search for the iGrow Culture
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.680]  Podcast. Find the review section. Give me a five-star rating. Come on. You know you want to
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.400]  give me a five-star rating. What that does is that knocks me up higher in the ranks. People see the
[35:37.400 --> 35:41.960]  show. More people listen to the show, which moves me up higher into the ranks. More people see the
[35:41.960 --> 35:46.760]  show. More people listen to the show. And in turn, more of your friends get to grow high-grade
[35:46.760 --> 35:51.960]  cannabis. More people get educated the proper way about cannabis. More people will quit believing
[35:51.960 --> 35:57.720]  bullshit about cannabis. More people will know the truth. Cannabis will be freed. Cannabis will be
[35:57.720 --> 36:02.520]  legalized everywhere. This is a small step for weed kind. I don't know what the fuck I'm saying
[36:02.520 --> 36:07.320]  anymore. Anyway, type in a little comment. Let me know what you think about the show. I'll read your
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.160]  comments on the show. It means a lot to me to know what people think. I say this all the time. If you
[36:11.160 --> 36:16.120]  love the show, go write a little comment. If you listened for this long, you probably liked it. But
[36:16.120 --> 36:19.960]  if you thought the show was totally retarded and you think I'm an idiot, tell me. Tell me what I'm
[36:19.960 --> 36:23.800]  doing wrong. Maybe I'll correct it. I probably don't give two shits because I like the way the
[36:23.800 --> 36:28.360]  show goes. I hope you guys like it too. If it's little stuff that I can fix, I'll do it. If there's
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.200]  little stuff that you're like, dude, that is so dumb or annoying, I'll think about it. But if
[36:32.200 --> 36:35.080]  you're like, your dreadlocks are dumb, you already know what my answer is going to be.
[36:36.760 --> 36:39.480]  You guys that are listening this far, you're not going to say that. I love you guys that are
[36:39.480 --> 36:42.760]  following me, listening. I've got two different monitors I'm looking at. It's why it looks like
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.560]  I'm darting around and I got paper here. It's the first time I tried to do an actual thought
[36:47.560 --> 36:53.160]  out video. There's another video, maybe episode 21, that it's goofy. I was really uncomfortable
[36:53.160 --> 36:56.600]  in that one. I'm getting better at the podcasting. I want to thank you guys for listening. I know I'm
[36:56.600 --> 37:03.640]  rambly, dabbed out, kind of had some caffeine. Got it going on today. So leave your comments
[37:03.640 --> 37:09.400]  on the show. I'll check them out. Stitcher updated their page. Oh God, excuse me. I'm burping on
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.200]  a podcast. Stitcher updated their page and you can leave comments a little more easily now and I
[37:14.200 --> 37:18.360]  can find your comments more easily. So leave your comments on Stitcher. And once again, let me the
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.000]  review so I move up in the ranks. We can legalize pot one step at a time. One click at a time,
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.240]  right? Well, that's our new motto here. Legalizing cannabis one click at a time. Spread that shit
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.480]  around the world. Somebody tweet me that because I'm going to forget it. Don't forget that every
[37:31.480 --> 37:37.080]  episode is available on iRegeneticsColorado.com. The show's available on iTunes. The show's
[37:37.080 --> 37:43.000]  available on Stitcher and I'm going to try to get all of the episodes on YouTube. That's a huge
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.640]  commitment you guys. It takes a lot of chunk of time. I'm going to try to do it and uploading an
[37:47.640 --> 37:53.880]  episode to YouTube. It takes the computer all day to get it up there. So sometimes it fails after
[37:53.880 --> 37:58.280]  you do it and that's the fun part of life. Anyway, I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[37:58.280 --> 38:02.840]  Thanks again for listening. Take a fat dab. Give your mom a hug for me. Here comes some
[38:45.230 --> 38:45.870]  Roots.
[38:45.870 --> 38:50.110]  Marriage Wanted has a very distinct smell. Okay. I'm going to pass around just a little
[38:50.110 --> 38:55.230]  tiny bit and I want you all to take a smell so you know when someone is smoking Marriage Wanted.
[39:14.910 --> 39:16.910]  any old kind of way.
[39:16.910 --> 39:20.910]  I like it when you roll it up real nice.
[39:20.910 --> 39:23.910]  But Lord, I hate the price.
[39:23.910 --> 39:26.910]  I like it in a Buddha bone, about two feet long.
[39:26.910 --> 39:30.910]  Don't have to hit it twice and you still feel nice.
[39:30.910 --> 39:33.910]  Pass the merry one.
[39:33.910 --> 39:58.760]  I said you know my feelings.
