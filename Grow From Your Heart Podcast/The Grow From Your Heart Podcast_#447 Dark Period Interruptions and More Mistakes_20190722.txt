[00:16.440 --> 00:33.040]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:33.040 --> 00:36.920]  It is time for Episode 447 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:36.920 --> 00:40.360]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.760]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:44.760 --> 00:50.160]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:50.160 --> 00:53.320]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:53.320 --> 00:58.080]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Lemon Gee batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:58.080 --> 01:05.940]  The potency label says this product contains 68.5% THC and 79.1% total cannabinoids.
[01:05.940 --> 01:07.280]  I really love the Lemon Gee.
[01:07.280 --> 01:09.840]  I'm cracking it open to get a nice smell right now.
[01:09.840 --> 01:13.680]  It is very lemon dominant, but it is a disgusting lemon flavor.
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.840]  There is an armpit and a garlicky sort of a thing going on with this Lemon Gee.
[01:17.840 --> 01:20.880]  I really enjoy the flavor and the aroma.
[01:20.880 --> 01:24.940]  The texture and consistency of this batter were beautiful, but my favorite part is the
[01:24.940 --> 01:27.160]  high from the Lemon Gee.
[01:27.160 --> 01:29.880]  Something about the Lemon Gee puts me in a really good mood.
[01:29.880 --> 01:31.560]  It makes my brain go really fast.
[01:31.560 --> 01:33.520]  It kind of makes me feel like I time travel.
[01:33.520 --> 01:35.080]  It is a really great concentrate.
[01:35.080 --> 01:39.960]  So, big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious and tremendous Lemon
[01:39.960 --> 01:40.960]  Gee batter.
[01:40.960 --> 01:42.880]  All right, Podcast World.
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.120]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of emails.
[01:45.120 --> 01:48.000]  We are going to follow up on some Grow Room mistakes.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.880]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a couple of our friends from Patreon.
[01:52.880 --> 01:56.640]  As always, I want to give a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my friend
[01:56.640 --> 01:57.640]  Miss Mel.
[01:57.640 --> 02:01.600]  I want to give a huge Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my buddy Stabby McStabwood.
[02:01.600 --> 02:05.040]  I always want to send a Viking handshake and a Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to
[02:05.040 --> 02:06.820]  my buddy Grimboldedruid.
[02:06.820 --> 02:09.840]  Of course, a Giant Podcast shout out to Hogan's Farms.
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.040]  Of course, a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my buddy Tanner M. And last but
[02:14.040 --> 02:18.320]  not least, I want to give a big shout out to my friend JustBaz.
[02:18.320 --> 02:21.120]  I want to thank all of you for the continued Patreon support.
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.120]  If anyone out there would like to learn how to become a patron and support the show on

[02:35.960 --> 02:39.720]  I've got one more thing I want to talk about before we get to the emails in this episode,
[02:39.720 --> 02:43.300]  and that is a photo contest that I am hosting on Cannabuzz.
[02:43.300 --> 02:46.400]  If you're not already on Cannabuzz, please join me over there.

[03:35.640 --> 03:39.040]  and my favorite photo out of the group will win a prize pack.
[03:39.040 --> 03:42.560]  I haven't talked about what the prize pack will contain, but I promise it will be worth
[03:42.560 --> 03:44.320]  your time and your energy.
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.520]  So please participate in the Irie Genetics photo contest on Cannabuzz.

[04:13.380 --> 04:17.320]  to win a fresh Irie Genetics prize package.
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.000]  And now I think it is time to start reading some emails from our listeners.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.220]  If you have been following the show, you know I've done a couple of episodes about mistakes
[04:25.220 --> 04:26.600]  that people make in the grow room.
[04:26.600 --> 04:28.360]  I admitted a bunch of mistakes I have made.
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.360]  Then I talked about common mistakes that I have seen in commercial environments.
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.880]  Since that episode, I have received several emails from listeners who wanted to confess
[04:36.880 --> 04:39.020]  to some of their grow room sins.
[04:39.020 --> 04:40.520]  So I've got a few emails in front of me.
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.960]  Let's jump into the first one.
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.720]  It goes a lot like this.
[04:43.720 --> 04:45.440]  It says, hey Ross to Jeff.
[04:45.440 --> 04:46.440]  It's been a minute.
[04:46.440 --> 04:47.440]  Yeah, it has been.
[04:47.440 --> 04:48.440]  Where you been?
[04:48.440 --> 04:49.440]  It's good to hear from you, bro.
[04:49.440 --> 04:52.880]  The message says, I started listening to the podcast four years ago for knowledge and stayed
[04:52.880 --> 04:56.040]  because I enjoy your enthusiasm towards cannabis and life.
[04:56.040 --> 04:57.080]  Hey, thank you, man.
[04:57.080 --> 04:58.080]  That means a lot to me.
[04:58.800 --> 04:59.800]  I do try to be enthusiastic.
[04:59.800 --> 05:00.800]  I try to have a good vibe.
[05:00.800 --> 05:02.120]  I try to stay positive.
[05:02.120 --> 05:03.460]  So thank you for noticing.
[05:03.460 --> 05:07.460]  That means a lot to me and I'm glad that you're learning something while you're listening.
[05:07.460 --> 05:10.240]  He says, this mistake happened recently.
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.100]  I work in a commercial grow facility where we started seeing some information that was
[05:14.100 --> 05:15.280]  not adding up.
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.560]  We were seeing things like foxtailing on our buds, but we assumed that our environment
[05:19.560 --> 05:21.020]  was fine.
[05:21.020 --> 05:25.400]  The problems continued and closer to harvest, the plants just seemed to burn out.
[05:25.400 --> 05:30.040]  We thought we had inspected everything until we realized that we had a light timer that
[05:30.040 --> 05:37.200]  was failing and for two weeks, our grow room was on a 24 hour on schedule.
[05:37.200 --> 05:42.020]  In hindsight, that really explains most of the issues in our garden.
[05:42.020 --> 05:46.040]  The biggest thing that I learned was thinking that this problem was something severe and
[05:46.040 --> 05:49.600]  that I needed an expert to be called in and help me solve the problem.
[05:49.600 --> 05:55.160]  But what we should have done is start in the beginning and check the very basics first.
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.520]  Now that was an expensive lesson, but that is a lesson that you have learned and I'm
[05:58.520 --> 06:03.400]  sure that nobody in that facility will ever make this mistake ever again.
[06:03.400 --> 06:06.880]  So it may have been costly, but you have learned from it and you won't do it again.
[06:06.880 --> 06:10.440]  And now you're able to share it with me and I'm sharing it with a lot of people.
[06:10.440 --> 06:14.000]  So if you're seeing weird things in your flower room, if the plants are not acting the way
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.600]  you think they should, if they're not flowering properly, if you're getting weird foxtailing,
[06:18.600 --> 06:20.160]  you may have a light issue.
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.080]  Your timer may be failing.
[06:22.080 --> 06:25.900]  Quite often, those timers with the tabs, which you push up or pull down to select the
[06:25.900 --> 06:28.340]  on and off times, they get stuck.
[06:28.340 --> 06:29.340]  They quit spinning.
[06:29.340 --> 06:33.160]  Either humidity or whatever in the air or something sticky, maybe you touch nutrients
[06:33.160 --> 06:35.640]  and touch those, or maybe you splash on the timer.
[06:35.640 --> 06:37.800]  They get stuck and they don't spin properly.
[06:37.800 --> 06:41.520]  So they're supposed to turn with the hour, but then they stop turning so your timer doesn't
[06:41.520 --> 06:43.000]  click on and click off.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.380]  That will result in your lights being off or on for way too long probably, or maybe
[06:47.380 --> 06:52.700]  even a cloner being off or on way too long or any sort of equipment not cycling properly,
[06:52.700 --> 06:57.620]  which can lead to major issues depending on how long this problem goes unnoticed.
[06:57.620 --> 07:02.820]  So one of the first things I would suggest is quality timers in all parts of the grow.
[07:02.820 --> 07:04.700]  Don't buy those cheap little peg timers.
[07:04.700 --> 07:09.540]  Get a quality grow room timer, something industrial if you can afford it, depending on your setup.
[07:09.540 --> 07:10.640]  Get a good timer.
[07:10.640 --> 07:13.460]  The next thing is to remember the basics.
[07:13.460 --> 07:16.300]  Just like this listener said, he thought he needed an expert.
[07:16.300 --> 07:19.580]  He thought he was going to call in consultants and spend a bunch of money when really all
[07:19.580 --> 07:23.980]  he needed to do was get a monitor or go in the room and see what's actually happening
[07:23.980 --> 07:24.980]  in the room.
[07:24.980 --> 07:28.100]  Now, there's nothing more reliable than walking in there yourself.
[07:28.100 --> 07:30.100]  You open the door and you say, oh, there's no lights.
[07:30.100 --> 07:31.100]  It's dark.
[07:31.100 --> 07:32.260]  That's really easy to see.
[07:32.260 --> 07:33.960]  We're not always at our grow facility.
[07:33.960 --> 07:35.780]  We have a lot of things going on.
[07:35.780 --> 07:38.180]  Today's life keeps every person extremely busy.
[07:38.180 --> 07:42.580]  I think we're living enough life for three people in most one person lives.
[07:42.580 --> 07:45.860]  But what would help you out is something like a grow room monitor.
[07:46.420 --> 07:48.300]  There are many different monitors available.
[07:48.300 --> 07:52.580]  Something like a pulse monitor, something like a PL grow monitor, anything like that,
[07:52.580 --> 07:55.660]  maybe a smart B unit, anything like that would help you out.
[07:55.660 --> 08:00.540]  That way you can pay attention to the lights, the temperature, the humidity, and everything
[08:00.540 --> 08:02.700]  happening in that grow when you're not there.
[08:02.700 --> 08:06.100]  When you start to see problems, you can say, when did we see this problem develop?
[08:06.100 --> 08:09.740]  You can pull up your charts and you can look and you can say, oh, look, it's really hot
[08:09.740 --> 08:10.820]  at night right here.
[08:10.820 --> 08:11.820]  Let's see why.
[08:11.820 --> 08:13.680]  Then you can start realizing maybe the lights are on.
[08:13.680 --> 08:15.960]  Maybe it's too warm because something's not cycling.
[08:15.960 --> 08:16.960]  That will help you out.
[08:16.960 --> 08:21.480]  Also, you can use those notes to math up with the notes you're taking on your nutrient feed.
[08:21.480 --> 08:26.400]  By using deductive reasoning and logic, you'll be able to tell what's causing the problem.
[08:26.400 --> 08:29.280]  A good monitor would help you out in this situation.
[08:29.280 --> 08:30.840]  But go back to the basics.
[08:30.840 --> 08:33.520]  Make sure that all of the basic shit is working.
[08:33.520 --> 08:35.080]  Are the lights cycling off and on?
[08:35.080 --> 08:36.480]  Is the air conditioner cycling?
[08:36.480 --> 08:37.520]  Are you over watering?
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.640]  How's the humidity?
[08:38.640 --> 08:40.480]  How is the VPD?
[08:40.480 --> 08:42.840]  Sometimes we just need to go back to the basics.
[08:42.840 --> 08:44.840]  That seems to be the biggest lesson in this message.
[08:44.840 --> 08:46.920]  I'm going to keep going because there is more.
[08:46.920 --> 08:52.040]  It says, I think for grow resumes, we should include our mistakes.
[08:52.040 --> 08:53.760]  That would be a great idea for a lot of people.
[08:53.760 --> 08:57.760]  Some people are not humbled and are not skilled enough, so they still need to play the Wizard
[08:57.760 --> 08:58.760]  of Oz.
[08:58.760 --> 09:00.960]  They are not going to tell us any mistakes they have made.
[09:00.960 --> 09:04.920]  He goes on to say, experience is the name we give for our mistakes.
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.920]  Yes, that is true.
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.960]  That is how I have become a really experienced and fairly good grower, is I have made a lot
[09:10.960 --> 09:12.200]  of mistakes.
[09:12.200 --> 09:17.240]  When I was new, I would make it a mission or a goal to take one plant out of every grow
[09:17.240 --> 09:20.360]  and try to destroy it and learn something new.
[09:20.360 --> 09:21.600]  Somebody would say, hey, have you ever done this?
[09:21.600 --> 09:22.600]  And I'd say, nope.
[09:22.600 --> 09:25.000]  And one of my friends would go and do that to their entire crop.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.420]  And they may kill it with that.
[09:26.420 --> 09:28.040]  They may literally kill it with that.
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.160]  I would do it to one plant and compare that to the plant next to it and see if it worked.
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.360]  That way I've got some sort of comparison.
[09:34.360 --> 09:38.080]  That way I have some sort of control, something to compare my new technique to.
[09:38.080 --> 09:42.160]  That way I know if it's usable, if it's worthwhile, or if it's just a habit or a trick that I
[09:42.160 --> 09:44.800]  picked up along the way that I need to eliminate.
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.680]  He wraps up the message by saying, I just wanted to share my story.
[09:48.680 --> 09:50.120]  Thanks again for all you do.
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.360]  Keep doing what you are doing, and maybe I will see you at a fish show at Dick's this
[09:54.360 --> 09:55.360]  summer.
[09:55.360 --> 09:56.800]  Hey, I look forward to seeing you at Dick's.
[09:56.800 --> 09:57.920]  I'm really easy to find.
[09:57.920 --> 09:58.920]  I'm 6'5".
[09:58.920 --> 09:59.920]  I got dreadlocks.
[09:59.920 --> 10:02.680]  I know there's a lot of dreadlocked white guys at a fish show.
[10:02.680 --> 10:03.800]  I kind of stand out.
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.960]  I don't go down in the front.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.800]  I'll be closer to the back of the venue.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.800]  I got some dancing space.
[10:07.800 --> 10:10.720]  I like to spread my arms and spin around like a hippie.
[10:10.720 --> 10:11.720]  That will be me.
[10:11.720 --> 10:12.720]  Say hi.
[10:12.720 --> 10:14.720]  He wraps it up with, you were a good person.
[10:14.720 --> 10:15.720]  Thank you and cheers.
[10:15.720 --> 10:18.520]  Then they sign their name, which I am not sure if they want said on the show, so I'm
[10:18.520 --> 10:20.200]  going to withhold that.
[10:20.200 --> 10:21.200]  They know who they are.
[10:21.200 --> 10:24.640]  A big thank you and a big shout out to them for the great email.
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.520]  Also a big shout out for being humble enough to admit that you have made a mistake in your
[10:28.520 --> 10:29.520]  grow room.
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.360]  All right, I do have another email in front of me.
[10:31.360 --> 10:32.360]  Let's just keep moving.
[10:32.360 --> 10:34.680]  It says, name can be used.
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.640]  So big shout out to my buddy, Big John.
[10:36.640 --> 10:37.640]  It goes like this.
[10:37.640 --> 10:42.200]  In the excitement of growing for the first time, I chose my seeds without thinking how
[10:42.200 --> 10:44.440]  tall they will grow.
[10:44.440 --> 10:46.640]  Well, I veged the shit out of them.
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.900]  I monster cropped them and I bent them for two full months.
[10:49.900 --> 10:51.560]  My girls were huge.
[10:51.560 --> 10:52.560]  Then I flipped to flower.
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.600]  Oh, I bet you had a jungle in there.
[10:54.600 --> 10:56.160]  He says, wow, what a jungle.
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.800]  Oh, you had a jungle in there, literally.
[10:57.800 --> 11:00.400]  He said, wow, what a jungle and quite overwhelming.
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.640]  Yeah, if you vege for two months and you do a lot of popping and twisting and super cropping,
[11:04.640 --> 11:07.360]  you are going to get quite a dense canopy.
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.200]  You'll have a nice lush area filled with plants, but it will be quite overwhelming and that
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.080]  can become quite a pain in the ass to work with if you were a new grower.
[11:15.080 --> 11:18.800]  So choosing seeds, I've talked about that in a previous episode.
[11:18.800 --> 11:21.640]  Choosing your seeds can be a very important process.
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.520]  If you don't realize that you've just purchased a haze that is going to grow 12 feet tall
[11:25.520 --> 11:28.760]  and take 16 weeks, that can really mess up your grow.
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.640]  So choose wisely when it comes to selecting your genetics.
[11:32.640 --> 11:34.240]  Now here's a shameless plug.
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.680]  Quite often people ask me what strain I would recommend for a new grower if they wanted
[11:38.680 --> 11:41.100]  to grow Irie genetics.
[11:41.100 --> 11:46.760]  If you want to grow regular Irie genetic seeds, I would recommend sun kiss and prana for new
[11:46.760 --> 11:47.760]  growers.
[11:47.760 --> 11:48.760]  Those are very easy plants to grow.
[11:48.760 --> 11:49.760]  They don't get too tall.
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.560]  They don't take really long to flower.
[11:51.560 --> 11:52.720]  They're easy to maintain.
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.680]  I think you'll have great success with them.
[11:54.680 --> 11:57.700]  So sun kiss and prana are what I would start with.
[11:57.700 --> 12:01.780]  If you're into feminized seeds, I would suggest orange chasm.
[12:01.780 --> 12:06.600]  Orange chasm will work wonderfully for growers of all experience levels.
[12:06.600 --> 12:07.840]  It is simple to grow.
[12:07.840 --> 12:12.580]  It finishes fairly early and it makes amazing flowers and concentrates.
[12:12.580 --> 12:16.740]  So you've got sun kiss, you've got prana, and you've got orange chasm are the things
[12:16.740 --> 12:19.140]  I would recommend for new growers.
[12:19.140 --> 12:20.940]  Now our friend Big John wraps up this message.
[12:20.940 --> 12:25.900]  He says, also I grow in deep water culture, which means that these plants were going even
[12:26.140 --> 12:27.740]  more quickly than I had assumed they were.
[12:27.740 --> 12:28.840]  These plants were taking off.
[12:28.840 --> 12:30.860]  This guy had a jungle in this grow room.
[12:30.860 --> 12:33.540]  I can only visualize how crowded that place was.
[12:33.540 --> 12:35.540]  I hope you didn't get powdery mildew problems.
[12:35.540 --> 12:40.220]  I hope that was a successful crop, but I am glad that you learned from your lesson.
[12:40.220 --> 12:43.780]  He wraps up the message by saying, yours truly, Big John.
[12:43.780 --> 12:47.800]  So hey Big John, thank you for the great email and thank you for admitting that you made
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.060]  a mistake when choosing your seeds for your first grow.
[12:51.060 --> 12:53.340]  All right, I've got another email in my hand.
[12:53.340 --> 12:55.780]  This one comes from a friend who calls themselves Matt.
[12:55.860 --> 12:56.860]  And he says, thanks for the message, Matt.
[12:56.860 --> 12:59.140]  It goes a lot like this.
[12:59.140 --> 13:00.220]  What's up Rasta Jeff?
[13:00.220 --> 13:03.660]  Just giving you a little insight on mistakes I have made in my grow.
[13:03.660 --> 13:06.980]  And some of these were compounded by other problems.
[13:06.980 --> 13:10.540]  I feel a lot of these problems could have been avoided with the proper equipment, but
[13:10.540 --> 13:14.780]  sometimes you don't have a choice and you just run what you brung.
[13:14.780 --> 13:15.900]  So here's the situation.
[13:15.900 --> 13:20.340]  I don't have a separate AC unit for the grow and I had to open and close the flower room
[13:20.340 --> 13:21.820]  door every day.
[13:21.820 --> 13:22.980]  Yes, you're right.
[13:22.980 --> 13:25.300]  I left the damn door open.
[13:25.820 --> 13:26.820]  And then he says, more than once.
[13:26.820 --> 13:30.860]  Man, luckily, I think I learned after the first time, but it sounds like our buddy Matt
[13:30.860 --> 13:31.860]  here is a little stubborn.
[13:31.860 --> 13:34.060]  He had to learn a couple of times.
[13:34.060 --> 13:38.460]  He says, I didn't have a dehumidifier either, so I had to make a homemade light blocking
[13:38.460 --> 13:40.120]  vent at the door.
[13:40.120 --> 13:43.260]  Before this, my nighttime humidity was higher than the day.
[13:43.260 --> 13:47.540]  During this cycle, I had one Afghani dominant girl and she did not like much water.
[13:47.540 --> 13:51.740]  I over watered her while some of my others got the right amount.
[13:51.740 --> 13:56.220]  He goes on to say, not having a monocrop in the first set of grows for a beginner can
[13:56.220 --> 13:57.620]  be a major mistake.
[13:57.620 --> 13:59.300]  Yeah, that can be a huge mistake.
[13:59.300 --> 14:03.260]  If you've got multiple different strains or different phenotypes in one room, you have
[14:03.260 --> 14:05.100]  to learn all of those phenotypes.
[14:05.100 --> 14:07.840]  You've got different girlfriends to learn how to take care of.
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.620]  One wants more water, one wants less water, one plant may want higher temperatures, one
[14:12.620 --> 14:14.440]  wants lower humidity.
[14:14.440 --> 14:16.360]  All of those plants want different things.
[14:16.360 --> 14:21.620]  So if you are running one strain, one cultivar in your room, it is much easier to learn that
[14:21.700 --> 14:23.460]  plant and dial in the room.
[14:23.460 --> 14:28.140]  You can make that one plant happier much more easily than you can multiple plants.
[14:28.140 --> 14:32.700]  The message goes on to say, not monocropping with absolutely no idea how these plants are
[14:32.700 --> 14:38.140]  going to behave led to light burn on some and not enough light on others.
[14:38.140 --> 14:42.140]  So exactly what I'm talking about, some of his plants grew really tall, they got really
[14:42.140 --> 14:47.020]  close and hit the lights, which actually caused shade on some of the smaller plants.
[14:47.020 --> 14:50.840]  So he would have been better off running a bunch of the same strain instead of a variety
[14:51.060 --> 14:52.700]  of different strains.
[14:52.700 --> 14:57.520]  It goes on to say, once I started to get everything dialed in a little bit better, it seemed that
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.560]  my genetics may have not been up to the task of providing the dank.
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.080]  I've concluded this when I sprouted a bag seed and even though the yield was low, it
[15:06.080 --> 15:07.280]  was incredible.
[15:07.280 --> 15:13.120]  If everything is running at 50%, the absolute best you can do is 50% even if you have the
[15:13.120 --> 15:14.320]  best seeds ever.
[15:14.320 --> 15:16.480]  Yes, that is absolutely true.
[15:16.480 --> 15:21.400]  Your grow space, your grow room, your grow setup is only as strong as its weakest link.
[15:21.400 --> 15:25.120]  So if you've got the best lights on the planet, you've got the best airflow, but you've got
[15:25.120 --> 15:29.080]  shitty seeds or shitty soil, you're going to come out with the shitty product in the
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.080]  end.
[15:30.080 --> 15:31.440]  We need everything to be 100%.
[15:31.440 --> 15:36.400]  Like this guy said, if you're running something at 50%, the best we can do is 50%.
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.720]  So you need quality equipment, you need the proper equipment, and of course you need quality
[15:41.720 --> 15:43.020]  genetics.
[15:43.020 --> 15:48.020]  This message goes on to say, but probably the most boneheaded mistake I've ever seen
[15:48.020 --> 15:50.140]  was from another person.
[15:50.140 --> 15:51.140]  We were drinking a little.
[15:51.140 --> 15:53.540]  Oh, I can, I don't want to know how this ends up.
[15:53.540 --> 15:58.340]  I do not encourage any drinking or alcohol consumption in the grow environment in any
[15:58.340 --> 15:59.340]  way.
[15:59.340 --> 16:02.300]  Actually, if you show up drunk to the commercial grow, I send you home.
[16:02.300 --> 16:03.940]  We have a little talk about that.
[16:03.940 --> 16:06.420]  You can cause a lot of mistakes being a little bit drunk.
[16:06.420 --> 16:08.000]  You can fuck up when you're stoned.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  Don't get me wrong.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.360]  be judgmental, but some terrible ideas, some terrible things come up when you're drinking.
[16:14.360 --> 16:15.400]  Let's hear about what happened.
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.560]  We were drinking a little and I messed with him and said to take the blowtorch to the
[16:19.560 --> 16:21.440]  spider bites.
[16:21.440 --> 16:24.280]  That's highly effective, but I'm sure that that went fucking wrong.
[16:24.280 --> 16:29.040]  He said their hatred for spider mites plus the alcohol and my comment led to a very bad
[16:29.040 --> 16:31.400]  idea on IPM.
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.760]  Let's just say that the plants defoliated themselves within the next few days.
[16:35.760 --> 16:37.840]  Man, you went in there with fire.
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.880]  You were lucky that those, well, they defoliated themselves and they probably died.
[16:40.880 --> 16:42.640]  I can't say you're lucky about anything.
[16:42.640 --> 16:44.580]  Those plants had problems.
[16:44.580 --> 16:48.000]  Those plants defoliated themselves and there were still spider mites.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.280]  You basically killed the wrong part and kept the bad part.
[16:51.280 --> 16:55.560]  He keeps saying I actually tried to stop him, but hey, alcohol.
[16:55.560 --> 16:57.600]  I was cringing the whole time.
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.880]  Yeah, you've got me cringing now just reading about it, just hearing about it, and it had
[17:01.880 --> 17:03.480]  nothing to do with my garden.
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.560]  I can only imagine what that smelled like.
[17:05.560 --> 17:10.640]  I can only imagine what those plants felt like getting fire put to them way too early.
[17:10.640 --> 17:13.720]  You're supposed to finish flowering those plants, then you're supposed to dry and cure
[17:13.720 --> 17:16.000]  them, then you're supposed to put fire to them.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.560]  You guys did that all backwards.
[17:17.560 --> 17:20.000]  Hey, thank you for the great message, Matt.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.200]  Dude, quit drinking in the grow room and behave yourself.
[17:23.200 --> 17:28.880]  Put the dab torch down and let's get a proper integrated pest management program in place.
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.440]  All right, podcast world, that is all of the emails I have got for this episode.
[17:32.440 --> 17:36.160]  I want to thank everybody for sending in their grow room mistake emails.
[17:36.160 --> 17:37.160]  I do appreciate it.
[17:37.160 --> 17:39.600]  Thank you for admitting your grow room sins.
[17:39.600 --> 17:42.560]  If anybody out there would like to send me an email, if you would like to tell me about
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.280]  more of your grow room mistakes, if you've got a grow question, if you've just got something
[17:46.280 --> 17:48.400]  you'd like to say, you can send me an email.
[17:48.400 --> 17:53.560]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I would love to hear from you.
[17:53.560 --> 17:56.800]  I've been thinking about this for the past few days and I was sure there were more mistakes
[17:56.800 --> 17:59.240]  that I have made that I forgot to mention on the show.
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.000]  One thing I thought of was I killed a bunch of seedlings one time.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  That's right.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.160]  I germinated a few packs of seeds.
[18:05.160 --> 18:06.480]  I labeled them all carefully.
[18:06.480 --> 18:07.720]  Then I went to work.
[18:07.720 --> 18:08.920]  I came home from work.
[18:08.920 --> 18:09.920]  I was exhausted.
[18:09.920 --> 18:12.880]  I ate dinner, took a shower, went to bed.
[18:12.880 --> 18:16.900]  About four in the morning, I woke up and went, oh, you killed all those seeds.
[18:16.900 --> 18:18.920]  They were dry by the time I went to go look at them.
[18:18.920 --> 18:19.920]  They were dead.
[18:19.920 --> 18:20.920]  It was over.
[18:20.920 --> 18:21.920]  That was expensive.
[18:21.920 --> 18:23.280]  I fucked up.
[18:23.280 --> 18:27.440]  There's another classic expensive example of ways that I have fucked up in the grow
[18:27.440 --> 18:28.440]  room.
[18:28.440 --> 18:29.920]  Another major mistake that I have made.
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.460]  All right, podcast world, I'm going to shift gears and I'm going to talk about another
[18:33.460 --> 18:36.000]  message I received from a listener.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  I received a message from a listener asking about interrupting dark cycles in a photo
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.480]  period plant, which is in flower.
[18:43.480 --> 18:47.600]  They asked if one interruption would cause possible problems.
[18:47.600 --> 18:51.440]  They were asking if just a couple of brief interruptions would cause problems and how
[18:51.440 --> 18:55.000]  critical it is to have that plant in total darkness.
[18:55.240 --> 18:59.900]  Let's talk briefly about how important it is to have our flowering plants in complete
[18:59.900 --> 19:04.600]  uninterrupted darkness during their night cycle in the flowering phase.
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.880]  If we are working with photo period cannabis plants, what triggers those plants to start
[19:08.880 --> 19:14.280]  making their flowering process is an uninterrupted 12 hour dark period.
[19:14.280 --> 19:16.480]  Some plants may need a little shorter dark period.
[19:16.480 --> 19:20.580]  Some plants may even need a little longer dark period, but most of what we have bred
[19:20.580 --> 19:23.360]  has been bred to want a 12 hour dark period.
[19:23.360 --> 19:24.800]  That is going to be different outdoors.
[19:24.800 --> 19:29.000]  We're going to talk about that in a very future, a very near upcoming episode, but
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.400]  indoors, we try to focus on a 12 hour dark period.
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.680]  What happens in that dark period is the plant realizes, hey, there is no sun happening.
[19:36.680 --> 19:38.800]  Different hormones start moving around the plant.
[19:38.800 --> 19:40.160]  The plant goes to sleep.
[19:40.160 --> 19:42.400]  Different things happen while that plant is sleeping.
[19:42.400 --> 19:47.360]  When that plant realizes we only get 12 hours of light, we get 12 hours of full darkness.
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.560]  It is time for us to flower because winter is coming and it's going to be too cold for
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.400]  me to continue, so I need to create flowers.
[19:54.400 --> 19:57.920]  The plant's main goal is to create flowers that receive pollen.
[19:57.920 --> 20:01.720]  The main goal for this plant is to receive pollen and create seeds so that it can live
[20:01.720 --> 20:02.900]  next year.
[20:02.900 --> 20:08.000]  We try our best to prevent that by not allowing any males into the grow, so we don't get seeds.
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.760]  We get big seedless delicious buds.
[20:10.760 --> 20:15.040]  The way that the plants know to do that process is that 12-12 cycle.
[20:15.040 --> 20:19.960]  Now if we do interrupt that cycle, we do run the risk of causing problems.
[20:19.960 --> 20:23.960]  How do you feel when you've been asleep for half of your night cycle and somebody wakes
[20:23.960 --> 20:24.960]  you up?
[20:24.960 --> 20:29.720]  Nobody is ever in a good mood if you get woken up halfway through your sleep cycle.
[20:29.720 --> 20:31.360]  You are used to getting 12 hours.
[20:31.360 --> 20:32.360]  You want 12 hours.
[20:32.360 --> 20:35.640]  If you're sleeping for 12 hours, you need to go to the doctor, but you're probably getting
[20:35.640 --> 20:37.280]  somewhere between six and eight hours.
[20:37.280 --> 20:40.620]  If somebody interrupts that, you're a cranky bitch all day.
[20:40.620 --> 20:45.920]  Your cannabis plants feel the same way, but the cannabis plants can't throw a fit all
[20:45.920 --> 20:46.920]  day.
[20:46.920 --> 20:49.160]  The cannabis plants can't have an attitude with you all day.
[20:49.160 --> 20:52.680]  Those cannabis plants can't go to Starbucks and get a fucking triple shot of something
[20:52.680 --> 20:56.280]  that will try to fix their morning and get their day back on track.
[20:56.280 --> 21:00.720]  Your cannabis plants have very few different ways to express their frustration with you
[21:00.720 --> 21:02.880]  for interrupting their dark cycle.
[21:02.880 --> 21:08.920]  The number one thing you're going to see from interrupted dark cycles is hermaphroditic
[21:08.920 --> 21:09.920]  plants.
[21:09.920 --> 21:15.560]  If you don't see herm flowers pop up, you still may see seeds in your finished crop.
[21:15.560 --> 21:18.920]  Those seeds are because you interrupted that light cycle.
[21:18.920 --> 21:20.920]  That will cause hermaphrodites.
[21:20.920 --> 21:23.320]  That will cause stress in your plants.
[21:23.320 --> 21:27.400]  Now the main part of the question was, how many of those light interruptions will it
[21:27.400 --> 21:30.600]  take to cause a problem with the garden?
[21:30.600 --> 21:36.520]  The answer is that that is very strain specific, probably very cultivar specific.
[21:36.520 --> 21:38.180]  It depends on the plant.
[21:38.180 --> 21:40.340]  It depends on the rest of the environment.
[21:40.340 --> 21:43.200]  It depends on the genetics and the breeding of that plant.
[21:43.200 --> 21:48.540]  Is there a hermaphroditic trait in that plant or is that plant a solid female?
[21:48.540 --> 21:52.940]  Most of what we are sharing as clones are solid females, but some of the clones that
[21:52.940 --> 21:57.700]  we are used to running do have the potential to express hermaphroditic traits if given
[21:57.700 --> 21:59.220]  the right environment.
[21:59.220 --> 22:05.540]  The perfect environment to express hermaphroditism is an interrupted light cycle.
[22:05.540 --> 22:07.100]  It is very plant specific.
[22:07.100 --> 22:08.980]  It is very phenotype specific.
[22:08.980 --> 22:11.300]  It is very cultivar specific.
[22:11.300 --> 22:16.260]  As a professional grower who runs large scale commercial environments, I follow the rule
[22:16.260 --> 22:20.320]  that any light interruption is too much interruption.
[22:20.320 --> 22:22.940]  Think of your garden as a no parking zone.
[22:22.940 --> 22:27.100]  When you drive downtown, you see a sign that says no parking.
[22:27.100 --> 22:30.180]  If you put your car there, a cop will give you a ticket.
[22:30.180 --> 22:33.560]  When you come back to your car and you say, I was only there a second, the cop is going
[22:33.560 --> 22:38.540]  to say, does that say a one second parking zone or does that say a no parking zone?
[22:38.540 --> 22:40.220]  It is no fucking parking.
[22:40.220 --> 22:42.000]  You can't park there just to run in.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.100]  I can't park there just because.
[22:44.100 --> 22:45.500]  It is no parking.
[22:45.500 --> 22:46.500]  None.
[22:46.500 --> 22:47.500]  Don't park here.
[22:47.500 --> 22:48.700]  Move your fucking car.
[22:48.700 --> 22:50.940]  Think that the grow room is the same way.
[22:50.940 --> 22:53.940]  It is a no parking zone when it comes to light interruptions.
[22:53.940 --> 22:54.940]  Zero.
[22:54.940 --> 22:55.940]  None.
[22:55.940 --> 22:56.940]  Don't let it happen.
[22:56.940 --> 22:58.180]  There's no excuse for it.
[22:58.180 --> 22:59.900]  There is no need for it.
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.900]  Don't allow it.
[23:00.900 --> 23:04.640]  Now, I do understand that things happen and you may need to run in there one night.
[23:04.640 --> 23:06.100]  You may hear something fall.
[23:06.100 --> 23:08.340]  You may hear the air conditioner start whistling.
[23:08.340 --> 23:09.860]  Something may go wrong.
[23:09.860 --> 23:15.460]  If you insist on going in your grow room during the dark cycle, I suggest entering that room
[23:15.620 --> 23:19.700]  with a green LED headlamp as your light source.
[23:19.700 --> 23:21.440]  You can function with that green light.
[23:21.440 --> 23:22.760]  You can see what is going on.
[23:22.760 --> 23:24.260]  You can identify a problem.
[23:24.260 --> 23:27.100]  You can move around the room without tripping and bumping into shit.
[23:27.100 --> 23:31.220]  And that green light will not affect the photo period of your plants.
[23:31.220 --> 23:35.740]  The plants will not know that there is even a light happening in that grow room if you
[23:35.740 --> 23:38.020]  use a green LED light.
[23:38.020 --> 23:42.100]  Now, there are a couple of things to think about while you're entering the room during
[23:42.100 --> 23:45.500]  the dark period and you are using your green LED light.
[23:45.500 --> 23:49.660]  The number one mistake I have seen people make in a commercial environment once they
[23:49.660 --> 23:54.340]  have entered a grow room in the dark period, they've got their LED headlamp, everything
[23:54.340 --> 23:55.820]  is going fine.
[23:55.820 --> 24:00.520]  Then some asshole wants to know what time it is, so they pull out their phone.
[24:00.520 --> 24:02.320]  That phone is a light.
[24:02.320 --> 24:04.620]  That phone, that light is light.
[24:04.620 --> 24:06.140]  That counts as a light interruption.
[24:06.140 --> 24:08.100]  It may be very minimal, but it counts.
[24:08.100 --> 24:09.620]  You are now interrupting the light.
[24:09.620 --> 24:13.500]  So if you're in that grow room, you've got your LED headlamp on, don't pull out your
[24:13.500 --> 24:15.260]  phone to see what time it is.
[24:15.260 --> 24:17.460]  Don't pull out your phone to check a text message.
[24:17.460 --> 24:19.980]  That can wait until you get out of the grow.
[24:19.980 --> 24:24.740]  Now another thing to think about when you are entering that dark room, make sure that
[24:24.740 --> 24:29.460]  when you open the door, you don't get light from another room shining right into the grow.
[24:29.460 --> 24:32.660]  Try to make the outer room dark if possible.
[24:32.660 --> 24:35.220]  Now I do understand that we don't live in a perfect world.
[24:35.220 --> 24:38.700]  You may not be able to make the outside environment perfectly dark.
[24:38.780 --> 24:42.340]  You may need to pull that door open, run in there as quickly as possible, and pull that
[24:42.340 --> 24:44.180]  door shut behind you.
[24:44.180 --> 24:49.060]  If you are running stable genetics, this should not cause a problem.
[24:49.060 --> 24:52.020]  But there are many words in that sentence that are very critical.
[24:52.020 --> 24:53.780]  The first word was stable.
[24:53.780 --> 24:56.780]  Your genetics must be stable or this will cause a problem.
[24:56.780 --> 24:59.380]  I also said if and should.
[24:59.380 --> 25:02.720]  If you are running stable genetics, it should not cause a problem.
[25:02.720 --> 25:05.220]  I don't know how stable your genetics are.
[25:05.220 --> 25:06.540]  I don't know who bred them.
[25:06.580 --> 25:09.660]  I don't know how close to a hermaphrodite those plants are.
[25:09.660 --> 25:13.500]  I don't know what other stressors they may be receiving that could contribute.
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.420]  This may just be the final straw.
[25:15.420 --> 25:19.660]  That simple light leak may just be the weight that broke that camel's back and it decided,
[25:19.660 --> 25:21.380]  fuck it, I'm a herm now.
[25:21.380 --> 25:28.180]  So I would recommend zero light interruptions unless it is an absolute emergency.
[25:28.180 --> 25:30.120]  Treat it like a no parking zone.
[25:30.120 --> 25:32.940]  It's not a parking here for a couple of minutes zone.
[25:32.940 --> 25:35.400]  It's not a I just parked here to run inside zone.
[25:35.400 --> 25:37.720]  It is a zero parking zone.
[25:37.720 --> 25:43.400]  All right, podcast world, that wraps up my rant on not interrupting the dark cycle.
[25:43.400 --> 25:46.240]  I have done a full episode called total darkness.
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.160]  If you'd like to listen to an entire episode based on total darkness in your grow room,
[25:50.160 --> 25:52.480]  I encourage you to check out that episode.
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.480]  That episode is number 291 and it is titled total darkness.
[25:56.480 --> 26:01.160]  In the future, I do have an episode planned talking about flowering our plants outdoors
[26:01.160 --> 26:05.080]  that will come out very soon because it is just about time for the outdoor flowering
[26:05.080 --> 26:06.080]  season.
[26:06.080 --> 26:08.200]  I hope you join me for that episode.

[28:43.640 --> 28:49.640]  Live, but don't leave me.
[28:49.640 --> 28:55.640]  Look around and choose your own ground.
[28:55.640 --> 28:59.640]  The longer you live, the higher you fly.
[28:59.640 --> 29:03.640]  The smile you give, the tears you'll cry.
[29:03.640 --> 29:09.640]  All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be.
[29:09.640 --> 29:17.640]  Run, rabbit, run.
[29:17.640 --> 29:23.640]  Dig that hole, forget the sun.
[29:23.640 --> 29:31.640]  When at last the work is done.
[29:31.640 --> 29:37.640]  Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one.
[29:37.640 --> 29:41.640]  The longer you live, the higher you fly.
[29:41.640 --> 29:45.640]  But only if you ride the tide.
[29:45.640 --> 29:49.640]  Fallen sun, the biggest wave.
[29:49.640 --> 29:55.640]  The risk of words and early grave.
