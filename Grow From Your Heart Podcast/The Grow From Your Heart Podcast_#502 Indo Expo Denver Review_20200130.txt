[00:00.000 --> 00:02.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[00:02.100 --> 00:04.360]  It is time for episode 502
[00:04.360 --> 00:06.180]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.180 --> 00:07.780]  Sitting at the table with me,
[00:07.780 --> 00:09.040]  is this counter fucking clockwise?
[00:09.040 --> 00:10.340]  Yeah, counterclockwise.
[00:10.340 --> 00:11.980]  Sitting at the table is White Mike.
[00:11.980 --> 00:14.380]  We got Double Door Dank and Tall Clint are back.
[00:14.380 --> 00:15.460]  Welcome to the show, boys and girls.
[00:15.460 --> 00:16.300]  Thanks for hanging out.
[00:16.300 --> 00:17.140]  Hello, man.
[00:17.140 --> 00:17.980]  How's it going?
[00:17.980 --> 00:18.800]  What's up, everybody?
[00:18.800 --> 00:19.640]  That's a super awkward intro.
[00:19.640 --> 00:20.580]  I fucking love it.
[00:20.580 --> 00:21.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the show
[00:21.980 --> 00:24.140]  is brought to you by our friends at Seeds here now.
[00:24.140 --> 00:25.640]  If you need new regular, feminized,
[00:25.640 --> 00:27.540]  or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[00:27.540 --> 00:30.880]  I highly, highly recommend Seeds here now.
[00:30.880 --> 00:35.880]  And of course you can find them at seedsherenow.com.
[00:36.520 --> 00:37.560]  We usually start the show
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.960]  by talking about what we're dabbing.
[00:38.960 --> 00:42.340]  I just took some fat dabs of ice cream live batter
[00:42.340 --> 00:43.800]  from Green Dot Labs,
[00:43.800 --> 00:47.040]  but we've got a special treat at the table tonight.
[00:47.040 --> 00:48.280]  Matt, tell us about what we're dabbing
[00:48.280 --> 00:50.200]  or what we're smoking over there.
[00:50.200 --> 00:51.720]  We actually have a little bit of flower
[00:51.720 --> 00:53.020]  from Lovin' in Her Eyes.
[00:53.020 --> 00:55.560]  We've got some Lovin' in Her Eyes flower,
[00:55.560 --> 00:57.540]  the lovely Lovin' in Her Eyes
[00:57.540 --> 00:59.280]  stopped by the booth at the Indo Expo
[00:59.280 --> 01:02.040]  and dropped off some grape cake.
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.140]  It smells fucking grape cake.
[01:05.140 --> 01:07.620]  It looks like fucking connoisseur.
[01:07.620 --> 01:09.980]  If you've ever seen Lovin' in Her Eyes' photos,
[01:09.980 --> 01:11.500]  if you haven't looked yet, go look.
[01:11.500 --> 01:13.500]  Lovin' in Her Eyes on Instagram.
[01:13.500 --> 01:14.900]  These buds are beautiful.
[01:14.900 --> 01:15.740]  It is sparkly.
[01:15.740 --> 01:17.180]  It's fried, stuck to my finger.
[01:17.180 --> 01:18.980]  I can't put the weed back in the jar.
[01:18.980 --> 01:19.820]  This is mine now, bro.
[01:19.820 --> 01:20.640]  Sorry.
[01:20.640 --> 01:21.480]  It's stuck to my finger.
[01:21.480 --> 01:22.320]  It's mine.
[01:22.320 --> 01:23.340]  It's cured perfectly.
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.960]  I gotta say, first, you know,
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.920]  I was very, very impressed with her stuff.
[01:29.920 --> 01:31.060]  Beautiful product.
[01:31.060 --> 01:33.400]  Big shout out to Lovin' in Her Eyes.
[01:33.400 --> 01:34.720]  Beautiful person, wonderful person.
[01:34.720 --> 01:36.200]  Got to meet her and her other half.
[01:36.200 --> 01:37.960]  They showed up at the booth at the Indo Expo.
[01:37.960 --> 01:39.040]  It was an honor to meet them.
[01:39.040 --> 01:41.320]  It's an honor to be smoking some grape cake
[01:41.320 --> 01:43.560]  grown by Lovin' in Her Eyes on the show.
[01:43.560 --> 01:44.720]  Thanks for bringing that, Matt.
[01:44.720 --> 01:45.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45.760 --> 01:48.640]  I was lucky enough to get to trade her a little bit of mine,
[01:48.640 --> 01:51.000]  so I'm hoping she enjoyed some of that as well.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.760]  I hope you get some feedback from her.
[01:53.100 --> 01:55.180]  She's actually grown a couple of my crosses now,
[01:55.180 --> 01:57.220]  so we may see some photos in the future.
[01:57.220 --> 01:58.060]  Yeah.
[01:58.060 --> 01:58.880]  Yeah.
[01:58.880 --> 02:00.220]  I was gonna wait to talk about this,
[02:00.220 --> 02:02.300]  but since we kind of segued into that accidentally,
[02:02.300 --> 02:07.300]  let's do an update on the Irie Genetics Instagram page.
[02:07.380 --> 02:08.860]  Recently, I discovered that Instagram
[02:08.860 --> 02:10.940]  fucked up the Irie Genetics Instagram page
[02:10.940 --> 02:14.200]  and made it, it was shadow banned really strongly.
[02:14.200 --> 02:16.540]  Then they changed it to where it was only viewable
[02:16.540 --> 02:21.420]  by viewers who were 21 years of age or older.
[02:21.420 --> 02:22.720]  Then I discovered that most people
[02:22.720 --> 02:24.120]  couldn't even see the page at all.
[02:24.120 --> 02:26.200]  So I went poking around and found some settings.
[02:26.200 --> 02:27.920]  I think I've corrected some of the settings,
[02:27.920 --> 02:31.400]  and you should be able to view my Instagram page now.
[02:31.400 --> 02:33.280]  So if we met you at the Indo Expo
[02:33.280 --> 02:35.840]  and you've been trying to find my Instagram, it's back.
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.080]  So give me another chance.
[02:37.080 --> 02:39.560]  Find me, it's irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[02:39.560 --> 02:42.680]  I've been posting a lot of high quality cannabis photography,
[02:42.680 --> 02:44.640]  a bunch of Indo Expo photos.
[02:44.640 --> 02:46.140]  So please, find me again.
[02:46.140 --> 02:47.120]  We would appreciate it.
[02:47.120 --> 02:47.960]  I miss you guys.
[02:47.960 --> 02:49.160]  It would be good to see ya.
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.400]  So that is the Instagram update.
[02:52.260 --> 02:53.260]  It is traditional that we do some shout outs
[02:53.260 --> 02:55.660]  to our friends from Patreon at the start of the show.
[02:55.660 --> 02:56.640]  So let's do that.
[02:56.640 --> 02:58.780]  Let's give a giant shout out to our friend Meredith.
[02:58.780 --> 03:00.740]  Let's give some shout outs to Steve Smith.
[03:00.740 --> 03:03.100]  I also want to send a giant shout out to Rick Roller.
[03:03.100 --> 03:04.980]  We owe a big thank you to Dabby Hayes.
[03:04.980 --> 03:07.820]  How about a big thank you to Brett G and Jacob W.
[03:07.820 --> 03:09.620]  Also want to send some love to James Brown,
[03:09.620 --> 03:11.600]  the hardest working man in cannabis.
[03:11.600 --> 03:14.780]  I also send a giant shout out to Keith K, Todd K,
[03:14.780 --> 03:17.220]  and last but not least, how about a big thank you shout out
[03:17.220 --> 03:19.260]  to Blackbird76.
[03:19.260 --> 03:20.420]  Big shout out to all those people
[03:20.440 --> 03:22.520]  who are supporting us on Patreon.
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.480]  If you are not supporting the show on Patreon
[03:24.480 --> 03:25.480]  and you would like to support us,
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.740]  you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[03:29.740 --> 03:32.880]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.160]  All of the information you need will be right there
[03:35.160 --> 03:37.000]  on the screen.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.560]  All right, I think we have covered most of the important
[03:39.560 --> 03:41.300]  business part of the show.
[03:41.300 --> 03:44.480]  Let's talk about this fun weekend that we got to have.
[03:44.480 --> 03:46.800]  I've got a really cool team of friends
[03:46.800 --> 03:49.700]  that came and helped me out at the Indo Expo this weekend.
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.960]  If you've been listening to the show,
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.040]  you know that last weekend was the Indo Expo
[03:54.040 --> 03:54.960]  in Denver, Colorado.
[03:54.960 --> 03:58.440]  The Indo Expo is, they claim to be the world's largest
[03:58.440 --> 04:00.560]  indoor cultivation expo.
[04:00.560 --> 04:02.660]  They have all of the nutrient companies,
[04:02.660 --> 04:06.160]  all of the lighting companies, all of the seed companies.
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.160]  What else was there, you guys?
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.520]  What am I missing?
[04:08.520 --> 04:09.360]  There was everything.
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.200]  Any extraction companies.
[04:10.200 --> 04:14.280]  Any business tied to marijuana or cannabis.
[04:14.280 --> 04:15.120]  Yes, anything in the industry was there.
[04:15.120 --> 04:17.900]  I feel like we're missing like eight or 10 things.
[04:17.900 --> 04:19.060]  It was there.
[04:19.060 --> 04:22.320]  Everything but consuming accessories.
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.560]  There wasn't much glass.
[04:23.560 --> 04:25.640]  It wasn't a vaporizer type of a thing.
[04:25.640 --> 04:26.920]  There was some, yes.
[04:26.920 --> 04:28.600]  There was clothing available.
[04:28.600 --> 04:31.940]  Then also there was an entire hemp pavilion
[04:31.940 --> 04:34.800]  that was focused on hemp and CBD products.
[04:34.800 --> 04:36.960]  So it had all of the cultivation covered.
[04:36.960 --> 04:39.040]  You could get free samples of nutrients.
[04:39.040 --> 04:40.120]  You could get lights.
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.400]  You could get stickers from every company on the planet.
[04:43.400 --> 04:45.040]  And there were plenty of people who did.
[04:45.040 --> 04:47.920]  Plenty of people got a lot of great stickers.
[04:47.940 --> 04:50.180]  But these boys, these gentlemen, these wonderful men
[04:50.180 --> 04:52.420]  came and helped out at the IRI Genetics booth
[04:52.420 --> 04:53.460]  at the Indo Expo.
[04:53.460 --> 04:54.380]  I owe them a big thank you.
[04:54.380 --> 04:55.220]  So thank you guys.
[04:55.220 --> 04:56.060]  You're welcome, Jeff.
[04:56.060 --> 04:56.980]  It was a great time.
[04:56.980 --> 04:58.360]  You guys did a great job.
[04:58.360 --> 04:59.940]  We had a lot of people visit the booth.
[04:59.940 --> 05:00.780]  It was-
[05:00.780 --> 05:02.140]  Big thank you to everybody that came out and saw us.
[05:02.140 --> 05:03.660]  Yes, big thanks to everybody.
[05:03.660 --> 05:05.200]  If you just stopped by and grabbed a sticker,
[05:05.200 --> 05:06.460]  if you fist bumped us,
[05:06.460 --> 05:08.620]  a lot of people just walked by and gave that friendly nod
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.580]  because they didn't want to disrupt the business.
[05:10.580 --> 05:12.260]  If you came and spent a couple of bucks,
[05:12.260 --> 05:13.740]  if you came and chatted our ears off,
[05:13.740 --> 05:16.020]  big shout out, big thank you for all of the support
[05:16.040 --> 05:18.640]  to everyone who showed us love at the Indo Expo.
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.900]  But these guys did a great job.
[05:19.900 --> 05:21.280]  There were a lot of people.
[05:21.280 --> 05:22.400]  And for a couple of moments,
[05:22.400 --> 05:25.020]  it was overwhelming for everybody, including myself.
[05:25.020 --> 05:27.280]  I'm used to this type of a crowd and this type of shit.
[05:27.280 --> 05:29.480]  I was like, oh God, that's a lot of people at the booth.
[05:29.480 --> 05:31.360]  We got to speed up our game.
[05:31.360 --> 05:33.540]  But these guys took good care of everybody.
[05:33.540 --> 05:36.360]  And the people that came to the booth, they understood.
[05:36.360 --> 05:37.880]  They can only help so many people at a time.
[05:37.880 --> 05:39.360]  And they wanted to meet Ross and Jeff.
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.320]  Most of the people wanted to shake my hand and say hi.
[05:41.320 --> 05:44.480]  The line at our booth wasn't the only line they ran into.
[05:44.500 --> 05:46.660]  Yeah, there were a lot of lines at the event.
[05:46.660 --> 05:49.020]  I really enjoyed that when people would meet me,
[05:49.020 --> 05:50.380]  I'd say, hey, do you listen to the show?
[05:50.380 --> 05:51.220]  And they'd say yes.
[05:51.220 --> 05:52.580]  And I'd go, that's Clint and that's Mike
[05:52.580 --> 05:53.660]  and that's Double Door Dank.
[05:53.660 --> 05:54.980]  And people would be like, holy shit.
[05:54.980 --> 05:56.620]  And they would want to meet you guys too.
[05:56.620 --> 05:58.100]  It was really cool to kind of share that love.
[05:58.100 --> 06:00.020]  Because usually I do these events by myself
[06:00.020 --> 06:02.580]  or with one other person who doesn't care to be noticed
[06:02.580 --> 06:03.900]  or anything, who hasn't been on the show.
[06:03.900 --> 06:05.380]  So it was cool to get you guys some love
[06:05.380 --> 06:07.220]  and get you out there, get you some high fives.
[06:07.220 --> 06:08.900]  It was really cool to meet a lot of people.
[06:08.900 --> 06:09.740]  That was fun.
[06:09.740 --> 06:13.260]  And I really had a good time.
[06:13.260 --> 06:15.160]  It was all positive experience.
[06:15.160 --> 06:16.920]  There was zero drama up there.
[06:16.920 --> 06:18.320]  It was so nice meeting people.
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.960]  It was so fun meeting someone.
[06:20.960 --> 06:25.240]  And then them looking at me and going, is it?
[06:25.240 --> 06:27.960]  And then you would like tell them, hey, that's Clint.
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.800]  Oh, all right, cool.
[06:29.800 --> 06:31.640]  You've got a pretty distinct deep voice.
[06:31.640 --> 06:32.480]  You know what I mean?
[06:32.480 --> 06:33.520]  When we talk about you being a tall guy.
[06:33.520 --> 06:35.400]  I get excited though, and it gets a little higher.
[06:35.400 --> 06:36.240]  So sometimes.
[06:36.240 --> 06:37.760]  I'm Clint, thanks for coming to the booth.
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.520]  Hi guys, I'm Clint.
[06:40.480 --> 06:43.040]  I was forever known as helper monkey.
[06:44.020 --> 06:45.100]  Which is really funny.
[06:45.100 --> 06:46.820]  They give us four passes for the event.
[06:46.820 --> 06:49.020]  And I wasn't sure who was going to be my fourth helper.
[06:49.020 --> 06:51.140]  I had somebody I was thinking about having help me,
[06:51.140 --> 06:52.980]  but then I thought that Matt would be a better fit.
[06:52.980 --> 06:55.260]  So when I registered the badge,
[06:55.260 --> 06:56.780]  I just put the word helper monkey on there
[06:56.780 --> 06:58.420]  because that's what they were going to be.
[06:58.420 --> 06:59.840]  And we got away with that.
[06:59.840 --> 07:01.180]  So it was all cool.
[07:01.180 --> 07:03.260]  I thought until I registered and I got an email that said,
[07:03.260 --> 07:04.660]  all right, you're registered helper monkey.
[07:04.660 --> 07:06.100]  Make sure to bring your ID.
[07:06.100 --> 07:08.020]  And I was like, oh, fuck, now what do I do?
[07:08.020 --> 07:08.900]  But I made it work.
[07:08.900 --> 07:09.900]  So it was cool.
[07:09.900 --> 07:10.740]  It was awesome.
[07:10.740 --> 07:12.100]  Somebody was telling me how great
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.480]  of a vertical light grower he was.
[07:13.480 --> 07:15.040]  And I was like, yeah, he is, man.
[07:15.040 --> 07:16.280]  He's a bad-ass guy.
[07:17.120 --> 07:19.280]  That guy does a good job.
[07:19.280 --> 07:20.640]  I really thought it was fun.
[07:20.640 --> 07:23.180]  I've been going to these events for a long time, years,
[07:23.180 --> 07:26.180]  high times, cannabis cups, indo expos, dude grows cups,
[07:26.180 --> 07:27.380]  whatever you want to talk about.
[07:27.380 --> 07:29.180]  I've probably been to the event in Colorado,
[07:29.180 --> 07:32.000]  710 cup, secret cup, secret sesh.
[07:32.000 --> 07:32.920]  I've been hitting them for a while.
[07:32.920 --> 07:35.600]  So I know most of the industry, most of the seed breeders,
[07:35.600 --> 07:36.440]  most of the growers,
[07:36.440 --> 07:39.480]  most of the Instagram people or whatever.
[07:39.480 --> 07:40.960]  A couple of these guys at the table,
[07:40.980 --> 07:43.380]  Clint doesn't give a shit about celebrities
[07:43.380 --> 07:44.220]  and popular people.
[07:44.220 --> 07:45.100]  That's just not his thing.
[07:45.100 --> 07:45.980]  No offense to Clint.
[07:45.980 --> 07:47.460]  A lot of people don't care about that stuff.
[07:47.460 --> 07:48.700]  That hype doesn't get them.
[07:48.700 --> 07:50.460]  Clint's got other shit on his mind.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.820]  So when he meets famous people, he's like,
[07:51.820 --> 07:53.020]  hey, you're famous, hi.
[07:53.020 --> 07:53.860]  Like it doesn't really,
[07:53.860 --> 07:55.740]  he doesn't get super starstruck most of the time.
[07:55.740 --> 07:57.300]  I don't know, man.
[07:57.300 --> 07:58.940]  Everybody's just human, so.
[07:58.940 --> 08:00.160]  Yeah, and when people,
[08:00.160 --> 08:01.820]  some people would meet me and get starstruck
[08:01.820 --> 08:03.780]  and I'd be like, no, bro, I got hungry today
[08:03.780 --> 08:05.420]  and I pooped today, just like you.
[08:05.420 --> 08:06.380]  It was fun to watch.
[08:06.380 --> 08:09.100]  Yeah, but sometimes people would come to the booth
[08:09.120 --> 08:11.720]  and say hi and it would be somebody from the industry
[08:11.720 --> 08:13.980]  that's like, that I find to be kind of, you know,
[08:13.980 --> 08:16.060]  somebody to look up to, somebody who's important.
[08:16.060 --> 08:17.400]  And these guys would have no idea
[08:17.400 --> 08:18.480]  who the fuck I'm talking to.
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.400]  And it'd be somebody that owns another seed company
[08:20.400 --> 08:23.080]  that I've looked up to or somebody that has inspired me.
[08:23.080 --> 08:24.520]  And when they would walk away, I'd be like, hey, Matt,
[08:24.520 --> 08:25.360]  do you know who that was?
[08:25.360 --> 08:26.560]  And they'd be like, no, who was that?
[08:26.560 --> 08:28.000]  I'd be like, oh, that's just this guy
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.120]  that owns this company.
[08:29.120 --> 08:31.120]  And he's like, oh my, holy shit.
[08:31.120 --> 08:32.480]  It was just, these guys had no idea
[08:32.480 --> 08:35.040]  who they were standing next to half the time.
[08:35.040 --> 08:35.880]  And then when they did,
[08:35.880 --> 08:37.800]  it was funny to watch you guys get kind of starstruck
[08:37.800 --> 08:38.640]  a couple of times.
[08:39.140 --> 08:39.980]  It was pretty fun, especially Matt,
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.740]  because he's kind of, he's a little younger than me,
[08:41.740 --> 08:43.500]  new to this, so it was fun to watch.
[08:43.500 --> 08:46.140]  Well, I do follow a lot of the social media stuff too.
[08:46.140 --> 08:49.020]  So like, you know, I spent like the last couple of years
[08:49.020 --> 08:51.060]  just watching like certain people's page
[08:51.060 --> 08:53.300]  and like to get to me, it was like, oh shit.
[08:53.300 --> 08:55.340]  Yeah, they just showed up at the booth to come say hi.
[08:55.340 --> 08:56.380]  They're like, oh.
[08:56.380 --> 08:59.060]  Well, a lot of people too hide what they look like
[08:59.060 --> 09:02.060]  really well off of their Instagram, you know, purposely.
[09:02.060 --> 09:06.380]  So you don't really have an idea, okay, this is, you know,
[09:06.380 --> 09:08.760]  loving in her eyes, you can know it's a girl probably
[09:08.760 --> 09:10.480]  because you know, it says her in there,
[09:10.480 --> 09:12.120]  but half of the other ones, you don't know,
[09:12.120 --> 09:14.520]  it could be a guy, it could be a girl, you know?
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.600]  And so when you're like, hey, you know who that was?
[09:16.600 --> 09:18.960]  And I'm like, no, who the fuck was it?
[09:18.960 --> 09:20.720]  Yeah, and then I'm like, well, that was this person.
[09:20.720 --> 09:21.560]  You're like, who the fuck is that?
[09:21.560 --> 09:23.000]  And I tell you, they're this on Instagram.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.520]  You're like, oh shit.
[09:24.520 --> 09:26.880]  Like, yeah, it's really funny, like trying to figure out.
[09:26.880 --> 09:29.520]  And then I have this thing where I'm not sure,
[09:29.520 --> 09:32.760]  I know people's real names, I know people's Instagram names
[09:32.760 --> 09:34.280]  and I know their email addresses.
[09:34.300 --> 09:37.420]  And sometimes I'm talking to three different conversations
[09:37.420 --> 09:38.940]  thinking it might be three different people.
[09:38.940 --> 09:40.500]  And then sometimes it hits me that,
[09:40.500 --> 09:43.380]  oh, this guy is also, this guy is also this guy.
[09:43.380 --> 09:44.620]  Or sometimes I'm thinking of talking,
[09:44.620 --> 09:46.620]  it's so hard to keep all the social media
[09:46.620 --> 09:49.080]  and real and email, all those conversations.
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.940]  Like, I don't know, maybe it's just me being weird,
[09:50.940 --> 09:53.100]  but it's hard to keep all those names and faces together.
[09:53.100 --> 09:55.820]  A lot of them I don't have faces for until the Indo Expo.
[09:55.820 --> 09:57.000]  So that's really fun.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.260]  Like getting to put a face to all these emails finally
[09:59.260 --> 10:00.100]  is really nice.
[10:00.100 --> 10:02.060]  Oh yeah, there was a lot of people that came up
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.680]  and it's like, hey, I'm on this on Cannabis.
[10:05.680 --> 10:07.520]  It was really cool to see that.
[10:07.520 --> 10:09.160]  Yeah, and like, oh, that's what you look like.
[10:09.160 --> 10:10.000]  That was cool.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.800]  It's really fun seeing what our demographic looks like
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.400]  because I have no idea.
[10:14.400 --> 10:16.080]  And it was fun watching them discover
[10:16.080 --> 10:18.480]  that we're all six foot something tall.
[10:18.480 --> 10:20.600]  They're looking at us like, what the fuck?
[10:20.600 --> 10:22.720]  All four of us, that was super fun.
[10:22.720 --> 10:24.000]  Matt said, it's a good thing
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.680]  it wasn't a breeders basketball tournament.
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.160]  Oh God, yeah.
[10:28.160 --> 10:30.280]  No, I watched like a couple of them walk by
[10:30.300 --> 10:32.100]  and just look like, oh, fuck.
[10:33.140 --> 10:33.980]  It was great.
[10:33.980 --> 10:34.820]  We're all peaceful.
[10:34.820 --> 10:36.620]  I didn't make myself six five.
[10:36.620 --> 10:37.460]  I just happened to be.
[10:37.460 --> 10:39.020]  And then a lot of people didn't realize
[10:39.020 --> 10:41.420]  I had dreadlocks that were this ridiculous.
[10:41.420 --> 10:42.860]  They're pretty well tied up for the event,
[10:42.860 --> 10:44.300]  but you can tell I got a lot of dreads up here
[10:44.300 --> 10:46.300]  and people were like, you got a lot of hair, dude.
[10:46.300 --> 10:47.740]  So it's interesting to see.
[10:47.740 --> 10:49.460]  I just think it's funny that the shortest dude
[10:49.460 --> 10:51.660]  at the booth is six two and that was me.
[10:51.660 --> 10:53.580]  Yeah, you're the tiniest dude there.
[10:53.580 --> 10:54.820]  That's why you're the helper monkey, bro.
[10:54.820 --> 10:55.660]  I know.
[10:57.100 --> 10:59.900]  Clint said it best a moment ago, Cannabis.
[11:00.840 --> 11:03.120]  A lot of our friends from Cannabis were at the event.
[11:03.120 --> 11:04.280]  Big shout out to JR Token.
[11:04.280 --> 11:06.380]  It was wonderful to smoke some bowls with you,
[11:06.380 --> 11:08.280]  spend some time with you, get some love.
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.160]  On Sunday, we ran out of Cannabis stickers and pamphlets
[11:12.160 --> 11:14.320]  and JR Token fell from the sky.
[11:14.320 --> 11:15.160]  I don't know where he came from.
[11:15.160 --> 11:16.000]  It just magically appeared.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.480]  Out of nowhere, poof, was at the corner of the booth there.
[11:18.480 --> 11:20.240]  Like eight minutes after we realized
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.440]  we'd ran out of Cannabis stuff.
[11:22.440 --> 11:24.520]  Set stickers and pamphlets down,
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.840]  gave Mike a fist bump and vanished into the crowd
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.040]  like a superhero again.
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.320]  We're like, well, that was pretty fucking cool.
[11:29.660 --> 11:31.500]  He just replenished us with advertising and left.
[11:31.500 --> 11:33.420]  Yeah, that guy had a really good energy around him.
[11:33.420 --> 11:34.260]  He was a cool guy.
[11:34.260 --> 11:35.080]  That was cool.
[11:35.080 --> 11:35.920]  I had a good conversation with him.
[11:35.920 --> 11:37.900]  I don't get to spend much time with that dude.
[11:37.900 --> 11:39.900]  And it was really great to spend some time with him.
[11:39.900 --> 11:42.340]  And a lot, if I, hey guys, if we got to hang out this week
[11:42.340 --> 11:43.780]  and I'm not gonna give everybody a shout out,
[11:43.780 --> 11:45.000]  but you know who you are,
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.300]  it really means a lot to me to sit down
[11:47.300 --> 11:48.660]  and or even if it's at the booth
[11:48.660 --> 11:50.080]  and I'm just shaking your hand for a moment,
[11:50.080 --> 11:52.300]  it means a lot to me to shake your hand,
[11:52.300 --> 11:53.520]  to look you in the eye.
[11:53.520 --> 11:56.060]  If we shared a moment, that does mean a fucking lot to me.
[11:56.060 --> 11:57.000]  I know it means a lot to you guys,
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.900]  cause you listen and you feel like you've been hearing me,
[11:59.900 --> 12:00.740]  but it means just as much to me to meet you
[12:00.740 --> 12:01.900]  and sit down and shake your hand.
[12:01.900 --> 12:04.060]  Like I got to hang out with the Embracing Organics crew.
[12:04.060 --> 12:06.180]  We hang out online, but to sit down
[12:06.180 --> 12:07.660]  and actually smoke with those guys
[12:07.660 --> 12:09.180]  and actually be friends with them,
[12:09.180 --> 12:10.100]  that shit is always fun.
[12:10.100 --> 12:11.500]  So it meant a lot to me to just hang out
[12:11.500 --> 12:12.340]  with that whole crew.
[12:12.340 --> 12:13.160]  And if you came to the booth,
[12:13.160 --> 12:15.380]  if you shared some energy with us, that means a lot.
[12:15.380 --> 12:17.100]  It's a lot of work doing these shows.
[12:17.100 --> 12:19.460]  It's a lot of work being a breeder and being,
[12:19.460 --> 12:21.380]  I hate to act like I'm somebody online,
[12:21.380 --> 12:22.500]  but a lot of people know who I am.
[12:22.500 --> 12:24.500]  And I get a lot of questions and a lot of interaction.
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.680]  It's exhausting, but these types of events,
[12:26.700 --> 12:29.500]  all these hugs, high fives, compliments, encouragement,
[12:29.500 --> 12:32.180]  fist bumps, simple nods,
[12:32.180 --> 12:34.220]  all that shit is like a battery recharger
[12:34.220 --> 12:35.300]  and I fucking love it.
[12:35.300 --> 12:36.140]  So thank you guys.
[12:36.140 --> 12:38.180]  You filled me back up for another six or seven months
[12:38.180 --> 12:40.140]  worth of fucking energy like that.
[12:40.140 --> 12:41.900]  It's really awesome.
[12:41.900 --> 12:44.700]  Cannabis, make sure you follow us on Cannabis.
[12:44.700 --> 12:46.100]  I read genetics on Cannabis.
[12:46.100 --> 12:47.260]  Shout out to JR Token.
[12:48.860 --> 12:50.220]  Let's see, Endo Expo.
[12:50.220 --> 12:51.900]  Do we have so many fun people come to the booth
[12:51.900 --> 12:54.100]  that I don't want to try to mention too many people
[12:54.100 --> 12:56.180]  cause we're going to forget people and miss stuff.
[12:56.680 --> 12:59.040]  Well, you had an overwhelming.
[12:59.040 --> 13:01.720]  You had an overwhelming amount of support this year
[13:01.720 --> 13:04.200]  from all kinds of companies,
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.240]  different breeders would come by.
[13:06.240 --> 13:08.880]  I mean, you really got the support and kind of love.
[13:08.880 --> 13:12.080]  Sunday I took more selfies with people on Sunday
[13:12.080 --> 13:14.880]  than I've taken all the past year.
[13:14.880 --> 13:15.920]  It was so much fun.
[13:15.920 --> 13:16.760]  I love it.
[13:16.760 --> 13:17.720]  And big shout out to everybody.
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.800]  Big thanks if you came by.
[13:18.800 --> 13:19.920]  Don't be the guy that was like,
[13:19.920 --> 13:21.400]  I saw you, didn't want to come by.
[13:21.400 --> 13:22.220]  Thank you.
[13:22.220 --> 13:23.160]  If you brought a gift, thank you.
[13:23.180 --> 13:27.580]  I'm looking at the table right now of gifts and freebies
[13:27.580 --> 13:29.260]  and love that people brought to me.
[13:29.260 --> 13:33.020]  There are t-shirts, there's weed, there's nutrients,
[13:33.020 --> 13:34.580]  there's a mug.
[13:34.580 --> 13:36.020]  There's probably enough t-shirts
[13:36.020 --> 13:38.020]  that I don't have to do laundry for a month.
[13:38.020 --> 13:39.580]  Yeah, people were super generous.
[13:39.580 --> 13:42.300]  I mean, one guy kept coming around with some cookies
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.340]  and I, you know.
[13:43.340 --> 13:44.820]  Oh, that's big Tim from Organtico.
[13:44.820 --> 13:45.660]  What's up Tim?
[13:45.660 --> 13:47.060]  Thanks for keeping my crew medicated.
[13:47.060 --> 13:48.620]  Man, thanks for the cookies.
[13:48.620 --> 13:49.820]  Big shout out to Tim and Miles.
[13:49.820 --> 13:51.140]  And of course a big shout out to Miss Amy.
[13:51.140 --> 13:52.340]  It was a pleasure seeing all of the,
[13:52.360 --> 13:54.040]  everybody that came up from New Mexico.
[13:54.040 --> 13:55.600]  We had a lot of Albuquerque folks
[13:55.600 --> 13:57.840]  and New Mexico friends out there.
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.280]  I was surprised at the variety of places
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.280]  people came in from like New Mexico, Arizona, Las Vegas.
[14:05.520 --> 14:06.360]  Philly.
[14:06.360 --> 14:07.180]  Philly.
[14:07.180 --> 14:08.840]  Illinois, Oklahoma.
[14:08.840 --> 14:11.000]  Our friend Lee came from London.
[14:11.000 --> 14:11.920]  Yep, London.
[14:11.920 --> 14:13.480]  Had a couple of friends from Oregon.
[14:13.480 --> 14:14.320]  Yep, yep.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.160]  Big shout out to Grozo.
[14:15.160 --> 14:16.000]  She was out there from Oregon.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.160]  Really nice crowds both days.
[14:17.160 --> 14:19.080]  It was, I mean, a really great event.
[14:19.960 --> 14:22.160]  What was your guys' favorite moment at the Indo Expo?
[14:22.980 --> 14:24.620]  Let's go fucking left to right.
[14:24.620 --> 14:26.780]  So Mike, did you have any standout moments?
[14:27.940 --> 14:30.300]  Twice on Saturday,
[14:33.900 --> 14:36.420]  listeners of the show know that this show
[14:36.420 --> 14:41.220]  and the Dude Grows show do a lot to support each other.
[14:41.220 --> 14:43.500]  Scotty and the Dude were at the Expo
[14:43.500 --> 14:45.840]  and stopped by our booth a couple times.
[14:46.860 --> 14:48.820]  Both times on Saturday that they stopped
[14:48.820 --> 14:50.280]  by our booth for a minute,
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.460]  while they were kind of standing
[14:51.460 --> 14:53.220]  on the right edge of our booth,
[14:53.220 --> 14:55.100]  at the left edge of our booth,
[14:55.100 --> 14:56.620]  there was somebody talking to Jeff
[14:56.620 --> 14:59.580]  who was saying enthusiastically,
[14:59.580 --> 15:01.460]  I found you guys through the DGC.
[15:01.460 --> 15:02.620]  I love both your shows.
[15:02.620 --> 15:04.260]  You guys are so awesome.
[15:04.260 --> 15:05.340]  I'm so glad I found you.
[15:05.340 --> 15:06.980]  It's so cool that you're here.
[15:06.980 --> 15:08.060]  I love the DGC.
[15:08.060 --> 15:10.260]  I love everything you guys are doing together
[15:10.260 --> 15:13.820]  without any hint of awareness that Scotty and the Dude
[15:13.820 --> 15:16.500]  are standing 16, 18 inches behind them.
[15:16.500 --> 15:18.980]  And it happened twice in an hour,
[15:18.980 --> 15:20.100]  within an hour from each other.
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.280]  It was just a beautiful, fun convention thing
[15:24.280 --> 15:26.800]  that I just, it's been amusing me since it happened, man.
[15:26.800 --> 15:28.100]  I've been smiling because of it.
[15:28.100 --> 15:29.880]  So if you don't watch the video show
[15:29.880 --> 15:30.720]  of the Dude Grows show,
[15:30.720 --> 15:33.280]  you don't know what the Dude and Scotty look like.
[15:33.280 --> 15:35.560]  I don't know if they were primary listeners
[15:35.560 --> 15:38.920]  or if they were just, call it in the spirit
[15:38.920 --> 15:41.840]  of the convention and not paying a lot of attention
[15:41.840 --> 15:43.400]  to who else was right around them.
[15:43.400 --> 15:46.720]  Some people were heavily medicated, might be the words.
[15:46.720 --> 15:47.640]  Yeah.
[15:47.640 --> 15:49.000]  You know, it was really convenient.
[15:49.020 --> 15:51.140]  You want to tell them about the discovery you made, Mike?
[15:51.140 --> 15:54.780]  What, the gender segregated vape lounge?
[15:54.780 --> 15:55.620]  Yes, yeah.
[15:55.620 --> 15:57.060]  Like about 40 feet from our booth?
[15:57.060 --> 15:58.300]  Yeah, it was really interesting.
[15:58.300 --> 16:00.300]  Mike pointed out that there was a gender specific
[16:00.300 --> 16:02.100]  vape lounge just to the right.
[16:02.100 --> 16:03.900]  And I went in there. Allegedly.
[16:03.900 --> 16:04.740]  Allegedly.
[16:04.740 --> 16:06.340]  And Joe Clint said, no, there was.
[16:06.340 --> 16:07.180]  Yeah, there was.
[16:07.180 --> 16:08.020]  We used the shit out of it.
[16:08.020 --> 16:10.420]  I'm about 40, almost 40 years old.
[16:10.420 --> 16:12.660]  I've been to a lot of events in Colorado
[16:12.660 --> 16:14.260]  over the last four decades.
[16:14.260 --> 16:18.220]  And never once has a bathroom ever smelled that nice.
[16:18.440 --> 16:20.280]  It was not bad to be in there.
[16:20.280 --> 16:21.240]  It was not a problem.
[16:21.240 --> 16:23.040]  You'd open that door and it was like, wow,
[16:23.040 --> 16:24.600]  it smells kind of nice in here.
[16:24.600 --> 16:25.440]  It's a little foggy.
[16:25.440 --> 16:27.040]  Yeah, I couldn't figure out why there were a bunch
[16:27.040 --> 16:29.840]  of urinals in the vape lounge, but I used them.
[16:31.360 --> 16:32.200]  I mean, it was convenient.
[16:32.200 --> 16:33.360]  It was really nice.
[16:33.360 --> 16:34.640]  Yeah, it was really convenient.
[16:34.640 --> 16:36.840]  That was about 30 or 40 feet from our booth.
[16:36.840 --> 16:38.220]  It made for a really nice weekend.
[16:38.220 --> 16:39.940]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs
[16:39.940 --> 16:43.680]  for these beautiful Green Dot Lab cartridges and pins.
[16:43.680 --> 16:44.520]  Thank you for the support.
[16:44.520 --> 16:45.560]  Super functional.
[16:45.560 --> 16:47.880]  You know, it was also cool because I got to finally meet
[16:48.540 --> 16:51.700]  the guy that runs the Green Dot Labs Instagram page.
[16:51.700 --> 16:53.260]  Also, Dreadlock White Guy.
[16:53.260 --> 16:54.100]  What's up, bro?
[16:54.100 --> 16:54.940]  Team Dreadlocks.
[16:54.940 --> 16:55.820]  Nice.
[16:55.820 --> 16:57.460]  I've been sharing a lot of posts
[16:57.460 --> 17:00.360]  or posting a lot of photos of my Green Dot concentrates
[17:00.360 --> 17:03.020]  and that dude shares my posts and gives me a lot of support.
[17:03.020 --> 17:04.820]  So it was really cool to finally meet the dude.
[17:04.820 --> 17:06.260]  Like I'm saying earlier, it was fucking nice
[17:06.260 --> 17:08.500]  to put some faces to all of these Instagram accounts
[17:08.500 --> 17:10.180]  and finally say, hey, thank you,
[17:10.180 --> 17:12.260]  because a lot of people give me a lot of support.
[17:12.260 --> 17:14.520]  I'm gonna give a special thank you to my friend,
[17:14.520 --> 17:16.760]  Jaren from New Millennium Nutrients.
[17:16.780 --> 17:19.540]  Every event I go to, I bump into Jaren.
[17:19.540 --> 17:21.660]  I ran into Jaren at the Fish Shows this summer
[17:21.660 --> 17:23.720]  and hung out with him there and burned down with him
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.800]  one night at the Fish Shows.
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.580]  Yeah, like Jaren is just, we're destined to be friends.
[17:27.580 --> 17:31.740]  So I see him at every event and he is much more experienced
[17:31.740 --> 17:33.840]  at going to these events than myself, I feel like.
[17:33.840 --> 17:36.300]  And he always makes me feel a little at ease
[17:36.300 --> 17:37.320]  and a little comfortable.
[17:37.320 --> 17:38.160]  It's like when you find,
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.940]  like the first day of school, when you're nervous
[17:39.940 --> 17:41.140]  and you find one of your friends,
[17:41.140 --> 17:42.500]  like, fuck, I gotta go find Mike.
[17:42.500 --> 17:43.580]  School sucks by myself.
[17:43.580 --> 17:45.060]  And when I see Jaren, I'm always like,
[17:45.060 --> 17:46.540]  oh, this event will be just fine.
[17:47.320 --> 17:48.160]  So shout out to Jaren.
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.080]  He's a good dude.
[17:49.080 --> 17:51.120]  He brought some New Millennium products to the table
[17:51.120 --> 17:52.760]  so we could display them.
[17:52.760 --> 17:54.800]  Also, I brought them home with me at the end of the event.
[17:54.800 --> 17:57.880]  That was a rental fee for that space on the table.
[17:57.880 --> 17:59.000]  So thanks for the Nutrients, bro.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.160]  I do big support for New Millennium.
[18:01.160 --> 18:03.720]  I'm going to do that episode that I keep telling everybody
[18:03.720 --> 18:05.160]  about, the mix episode.
[18:05.160 --> 18:07.600]  It's probably gonna be around episode 505.
[18:07.600 --> 18:09.240]  So stay tuned, that is coming.
[18:09.240 --> 18:10.280]  I'm not lying to you.
[18:10.280 --> 18:12.760]  I just got thrown off.
[18:12.760 --> 18:15.280]  So Mike's favorite moments were when the dude and Scotty
[18:15.300 --> 18:16.980]  were standing there and people were telling me
[18:16.980 --> 18:18.020]  how much they love them.
[18:18.020 --> 18:20.180]  And were you at least polite enough to be like,
[18:20.180 --> 18:22.020]  well, that tall guy and that short guy,
[18:22.020 --> 18:24.860]  Beavis and Butthead right there are Scotty and the dude.
[18:24.860 --> 18:27.820]  But both times, the person talking
[18:27.820 --> 18:29.380]  was a little bit starstruck.
[18:29.380 --> 18:33.100]  And they were too into talking to you in the moment
[18:33.100 --> 18:34.980]  to catch that there were other people around them
[18:34.980 --> 18:35.880]  at all, really.
[18:36.820 --> 18:40.660]  I mean, it was just a really fun convention moment
[18:40.660 --> 18:42.660]  that I don't know, it was too perfect
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.260]  not to share with the listeners.
[18:44.260 --> 18:45.080]  That's pretty fun.
[18:45.840 --> 18:47.780]  Shout out to the dude and Scotty and also to Guru.
[18:47.780 --> 18:49.540]  It was good seeing all of you guys.
[18:49.540 --> 18:51.260]  All right, Matt, you're over there packing a bowl.
[18:51.260 --> 18:53.740]  You're being a good helper monkey, but it is time.
[18:53.740 --> 18:56.860]  Let's ask a man, what was your, one of your favorite,
[18:56.860 --> 18:58.020]  or you can have more than one,
[18:58.020 --> 18:59.500]  but what were some standout moments for you
[18:59.500 --> 19:01.060]  at the Indow Expo this weekend?
[19:03.460 --> 19:04.700]  I don't know, man.
[19:04.700 --> 19:06.700]  There was a lot of people who came by
[19:06.700 --> 19:09.100]  and just the amount of love and the things
[19:09.100 --> 19:11.540]  they wanted to talk to you and take pictures with you.
[19:11.540 --> 19:13.820]  It was just kind of amazing to see
[19:13.840 --> 19:16.240]  how much support you have from all over the country.
[19:16.240 --> 19:20.340]  And there was also like funny moments as well
[19:20.340 --> 19:23.000]  where like somebody would come over just hammered drunk
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.200]  because even though it wasn't like, you know,
[19:25.200 --> 19:27.480]  an open consumption event, they had a bar going.
[19:27.480 --> 19:28.600]  So.
[19:28.600 --> 19:30.360]  I'm not sure that guy was drunk.
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.600]  I know who you're talking about.
[19:31.600 --> 19:33.240]  I'm not sure that was alcohol, bro.
[19:33.240 --> 19:36.160]  I think, yeah, yeah, he might've just been like.
[19:36.160 --> 19:39.520]  No, no, no, he was definitely not on our plane.
[19:39.520 --> 19:40.400]  I think he was. Oh man.
[19:40.400 --> 19:42.240]  Yeah, he was tripping his face off is what I think.
[19:42.300 --> 19:45.980]  I talked to him, I attempted communication with that person.
[19:45.980 --> 19:47.420]  Bro, if you're listening, it's okay.
[19:47.420 --> 19:48.660]  Yeah, it's totally cool, man.
[19:48.660 --> 19:50.860]  It just wasn't a fish show, it was an Indow Expo.
[19:50.860 --> 19:52.380]  So you're gonna have to adjust.
[19:52.380 --> 19:55.460]  But yeah, that dude was tripping his fucking peepee off.
[19:55.460 --> 19:56.300]  Oh man.
[19:56.300 --> 19:57.780]  Yeah, he was hugging the table.
[19:57.780 --> 20:00.300]  As he's talking to me like about strains,
[20:00.300 --> 20:02.060]  he's like, well, what do you got?
[20:02.060 --> 20:04.300]  And he's like hugging the table and I'm like,
[20:05.300 --> 20:07.740]  I gotta find you a chair is what I got.
[20:07.740 --> 20:09.660]  He was having a hard time putting his day together.
[20:09.660 --> 20:12.100]  So tripping dude was your favorite part.
[20:12.760 --> 20:16.120]  Yeah, I mean that and just being able to look around
[20:16.120 --> 20:18.720]  at the end of it, we had kind of a hangout session
[20:18.720 --> 20:22.200]  and being able to look around and see like all of the people
[20:22.200 --> 20:24.400]  that are watching the podcast and stuff
[20:24.400 --> 20:28.520]  and just like see him like smoking a bowl with me and shit.
[20:28.520 --> 20:31.880]  It's just kind of nice because you watch him and you know.
[20:31.880 --> 20:36.560]  We had a little after party at Frosty McNuggets' house.
[20:36.560 --> 20:37.640]  I don't know if I was supposed to say that,
[20:37.640 --> 20:39.120]  but big shout out to Frosty McNuggets.
[20:39.120 --> 20:41.920]  He threw an awesome after party at that place.
[20:42.740 --> 20:43.580]  It was a little basement bro-y,
[20:43.580 --> 20:46.060]  but it was honestly exactly what I fucking wanted
[20:46.060 --> 20:46.900]  that evening.
[20:46.900 --> 20:48.320]  I got to hang out with all of my friends
[20:48.320 --> 20:49.460]  from Embracing Organics.
[20:49.460 --> 20:51.620]  I got to hang out with Mike was there,
[20:51.620 --> 20:53.300]  Matt was there, Clint was there.
[20:53.300 --> 20:55.440]  Usually I don't have my hometown crew with me.
[20:55.440 --> 20:57.620]  So I get to come back and tell you guys how much fun I had.
[20:57.620 --> 20:59.900]  It was really fun spending that with you guys,
[20:59.900 --> 21:01.260]  kind of taking you to my world.
[21:01.260 --> 21:02.780]  Cause I always come back and I'm like, I did this,
[21:02.780 --> 21:05.100]  I did this and it sounds fantastical.
[21:05.100 --> 21:06.300]  And now you guys are like, holy shit,
[21:06.300 --> 21:07.980]  he really does this stuff sometimes.
[21:07.980 --> 21:09.860]  So you got to come see it and experience it.
[21:09.860 --> 21:11.560]  But the Embracing Organics crew was there.
[21:12.200 --> 21:13.040]  Fumidor was fucking there.
[21:13.040 --> 21:14.340]  He came in, we never get to hang out with Fumidor.
[21:14.340 --> 21:16.220]  That was my first time with Fumidor.
[21:16.220 --> 21:18.580]  The Dude Grows crew was there for a little bit.
[21:18.580 --> 21:19.420]  They couldn't all,
[21:19.420 --> 21:21.320]  the dude couldn't make it, but Scotty was there.
[21:21.320 --> 21:22.160]  So it was really nice,
[21:22.160 --> 21:24.420]  just like you said to have all the podcast crew there.
[21:24.420 --> 21:25.700]  Half of the DGC was there.
[21:25.700 --> 21:27.860]  A bunch of the Irie Army was there.
[21:27.860 --> 21:29.460]  Pedro and Dizzy showed up.
[21:29.460 --> 21:31.020]  Like it was such a cool fucking party.
[21:31.020 --> 21:33.660]  And yeah, dude, I was feeling the same kind of vibe
[21:33.660 --> 21:35.340]  that you were like, this is all the people.
[21:35.340 --> 21:37.020]  And like, I only get to see them online.
[21:37.020 --> 21:38.980]  So it was kind of cool to just chill out with them
[21:38.980 --> 21:41.340]  and actually pass a bowl around and take some dabs
[21:42.080 --> 21:43.600]  and fucking smoke together.
[21:43.600 --> 21:44.520]  It was kind of nice.
[21:44.520 --> 21:45.360]  Yeah, man.
[21:45.360 --> 21:47.800]  It was a gathering of a lot of great people.
[21:47.800 --> 21:49.400]  Everybody was super nice.
[21:49.400 --> 21:50.520]  Yeah, and Clint was there too.
[21:50.520 --> 21:51.960]  Welcoming, you know.
[21:51.960 --> 21:53.720]  And Clint was there as well.
[21:53.720 --> 21:55.040]  I'm being very nice now.
[21:55.040 --> 21:55.880]  Yeah.
[21:55.880 --> 21:56.720]  I gotta make up for it.
[21:56.720 --> 21:58.440]  Oh, you're a great guy, Clint.
[21:58.440 --> 22:00.120]  All right, Matt, thanks for your input.
[22:00.120 --> 22:01.040]  Let's move over to Clint.
[22:01.040 --> 22:02.680]  Clint, you already know the question, I hope.
[22:02.680 --> 22:04.600]  Oh man, I had such a good-
[22:04.600 --> 22:05.600]  What's your favorite movie?
[22:05.600 --> 22:06.680]  No, I'm just kidding.
[22:06.680 --> 22:08.800]  You know, now I'm stuck.
[22:08.800 --> 22:10.280]  You got me, Doug Benson.
[22:10.280 --> 22:11.120]  Oh God.
[22:11.900 --> 22:13.700]  Don't ever do that again.
[22:13.700 --> 22:14.540]  What was one of your favorite-
[22:14.540 --> 22:17.100]  Don't ever ask me what my favorite movie is again.
[22:17.100 --> 22:17.940]  I will never do that again.
[22:17.940 --> 22:20.220]  I guess it's fucking accurate too.
[22:20.220 --> 22:23.080]  So what was one or two or all of your favorite moments
[22:23.080 --> 22:24.260]  at the Indow Expo this weekend?
[22:24.260 --> 22:26.460]  I got to meet so many cool people.
[22:26.460 --> 22:29.020]  There was zero drama all weekend.
[22:29.020 --> 22:31.360]  It was so fun.
[22:31.360 --> 22:32.980]  Throughout the whole weekend,
[22:32.980 --> 22:34.460]  you know, we got to meet Theo Vaughn.
[22:34.460 --> 22:35.620]  That was cool.
[22:35.620 --> 22:36.700]  So-
[22:36.700 --> 22:38.900]  We didn't even touch on that, did we, bro?
[22:38.900 --> 22:40.380]  I mean, we'll get to that later.
[22:40.920 --> 22:41.920]  I mean, that was some-
[22:41.920 --> 22:42.760]  I guess-
[22:42.760 --> 22:44.560]  You know what, we'll just go for it now.
[22:44.560 --> 22:46.880]  We get to go to a comedy show Friday
[22:46.880 --> 22:49.040]  and that was Theo Vaughn.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.080]  Yeah.
[22:50.080 --> 22:52.720]  Boy, I'm gonna, please tell me,
[22:52.720 --> 22:55.840]  Ari, what was his opener?
[22:55.840 --> 22:57.920]  Or I'm sorry, I don't remember the name.
[22:57.920 --> 22:59.200]  Thank you.
[22:59.200 --> 23:00.040]  Ari Maness.
[23:00.040 --> 23:02.360]  And then what was his opener's name?
[23:02.360 --> 23:03.920]  I can't remember the other guy opener.
[23:03.920 --> 23:05.720]  The first one, Billy something.
[23:05.720 --> 23:08.680]  It was a really, really plain guy, plain white guy.
[23:08.680 --> 23:09.520]  Sorry, plain white guy.
[23:09.540 --> 23:10.660]  Bad job.
[23:10.660 --> 23:12.180]  Yeah, that is Mike's job.
[23:12.180 --> 23:13.860]  So we got to go see Theo Vaughn.
[23:13.860 --> 23:14.700]  We got to see Theo.
[23:14.700 --> 23:15.520]  That was cool.
[23:15.520 --> 23:17.140]  Got to talk with him for a minute.
[23:17.140 --> 23:19.740]  He was cool as hell.
[23:19.740 --> 23:21.780]  And there was a long line behind us,
[23:21.780 --> 23:23.620]  so I didn't want to take up much of his time.
[23:23.620 --> 23:24.460]  So-
[23:24.460 --> 23:25.460]  Yeah, they were good at that.
[23:25.460 --> 23:26.580]  We know just to shake hands,
[23:26.580 --> 23:27.860]  get a picture, get the F out.
[23:27.860 --> 23:29.580]  They gave us good seats.
[23:29.580 --> 23:31.700]  And this was at the Comedy Works South Club.
[23:31.700 --> 23:33.860]  Yes, the landmark, not our normal club.
[23:33.860 --> 23:36.540]  And it was nice seeing some faces
[23:36.540 --> 23:38.380]  that I recognized from the other club
[23:38.400 --> 23:40.200]  that must just go back and forth
[23:40.200 --> 23:42.160]  at a managerial level or something.
[23:42.160 --> 23:45.300]  So those guys are cool.
[23:45.300 --> 23:46.960]  New waitresses are awesome.
[23:46.960 --> 23:49.000]  I don't know, I hadn't been to this club before,
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.640]  so it was really fun to go to this one.
[23:51.640 --> 23:53.560]  It was a different feeling there.
[23:53.560 --> 23:55.120]  A completely different vibe.
[23:55.120 --> 23:56.480]  It was a completely different feeling,
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.560]  completely different setup.
[23:57.560 --> 23:59.240]  You were absolutely correct there.
[23:59.240 --> 24:00.760]  So that was my favorite part.
[24:00.760 --> 24:03.200]  I didn't mean to take away from,
[24:03.200 --> 24:04.720]  these guys can't really comment on it,
[24:04.720 --> 24:05.560]  so it's tough to-
[24:05.560 --> 24:07.600]  No, dude, I wanted to have a good segue
[24:07.620 --> 24:08.440]  to talk about Theo.
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.860]  There's a note right here that says Theo.
[24:09.860 --> 24:13.180]  So Friday, I went and set up for the Indo Expo.
[24:13.180 --> 24:15.140]  Basically put up the banner and threw up a tablecloth
[24:15.140 --> 24:16.580]  and carried in a box of shirts.
[24:16.580 --> 24:19.260]  And then I met up with Clint and we got to go see Theo.
[24:19.260 --> 24:20.720]  I thought it was a pretty good show.
[24:20.720 --> 24:22.960]  The crowd was disruptive.
[24:22.960 --> 24:25.520]  The show was disorganized.
[24:25.520 --> 24:28.180]  Theo was in disarray.
[24:28.180 --> 24:31.480]  And that's exactly what you expect when you go see Theo.
[24:31.480 --> 24:32.820]  I think that's probably,
[24:32.820 --> 24:35.560]  it's like when you go see a baseball game,
[24:35.560 --> 24:37.420]  you expect to see dudes in baseball pants
[24:38.240 --> 24:39.080]  throwing a ball.
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.040]  I expected to see exactly what I got
[24:40.040 --> 24:41.240]  when I went to go see Theo.
[24:41.240 --> 24:44.320]  Yeah, his haircut says what he's going to be doing on stage.
[24:44.320 --> 24:47.320]  That is basically absolutely
[24:47.320 --> 24:48.520]  all you've got to say about that show.
[24:48.520 --> 24:50.980]  That haircut tells you what you're going to get.
[24:50.980 --> 24:52.120]  Tight mullet.
[24:52.120 --> 24:53.120]  Okay.
[24:53.120 --> 24:53.960]  That was fun.
[24:53.960 --> 24:54.780]  We got to meet Theo.
[24:55.960 --> 24:57.280]  Yeah, it was fun meeting Theo.
[24:57.280 --> 24:58.120]  Got a good picture with him.
[24:58.120 --> 24:59.400]  He took a couple of pictures with me
[24:59.400 --> 25:01.300]  because the lighting wasn't right in the first one.
[25:01.300 --> 25:02.720]  So he went back for another photo.
[25:02.720 --> 25:04.960]  I've never had an artist actually make sure
[25:04.960 --> 25:06.880]  that my photo was good before, so that was cool.
[25:07.220 --> 25:08.260]  Well, we were first in line,
[25:08.260 --> 25:11.060]  so he wanted to make sure that everybody else's photos got,
[25:11.060 --> 25:12.600]  I mean, I thought it was smart as hell,
[25:12.600 --> 25:14.480]  just he wanted to get the lighting right on you,
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.260]  so that way he can get himself and the next person
[25:17.260 --> 25:18.380]  in the right spot every time.
[25:18.380 --> 25:20.140]  All right, that makes a lot more sense.
[25:20.140 --> 25:21.580]  That makes more sense to me.
[25:21.580 --> 25:22.420]  All right.
[25:22.420 --> 25:23.240]  That's what I think.
[25:23.240 --> 25:26.020]  Thank you to our friend Kelsey at Comedy Works.
[25:26.020 --> 25:28.980]  We met Kelsey at, which show was that?
[25:28.980 --> 25:29.820]  Who did we see?
[25:29.820 --> 25:32.540]  It was when Elliot Woolsey opened for,
[25:32.540 --> 25:33.620]  who did we see just recently?
[25:33.620 --> 25:34.820]  We talked about it a lot.
[25:34.820 --> 25:36.460]  Damn, dude, we smoked too much weed.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.960]  That was the last show at Comedy Works.
[25:38.960 --> 25:39.800]  Oh man.
[25:39.800 --> 25:41.840]  I'm such a fucking pothead.
[25:41.840 --> 25:43.000]  We met Kelsey there.
[25:43.000 --> 25:43.840]  It'll come to us.
[25:43.840 --> 25:44.680]  This weekend is just fucking destroyed.
[25:44.680 --> 25:46.480]  Yeah, this weekend is all that's on my brain.
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.680]  I can't think of the comedy show before that one.
[25:48.680 --> 25:50.040]  Come on, somebody help us out.
[25:50.040 --> 25:50.880]  Who did we see?
[25:50.880 --> 25:52.680]  I mean, I secondhand dabbed so much.
[25:52.680 --> 25:53.880]  Fucking Santino, bro.
[25:53.880 --> 25:55.200]  We saw Chido Santino.
[25:55.200 --> 25:57.400]  So we were at Santino and we met Kelsey
[25:57.400 --> 25:59.360]  because I had my Brody Stevens pin on my hat
[25:59.360 --> 26:00.960]  and she said, hey, I like your hat.
[26:00.960 --> 26:02.760]  And I told her positive energy
[26:02.760 --> 26:04.880]  and then I said something about enjoy it.
[26:04.900 --> 26:05.860]  And she said, you got it.
[26:05.860 --> 26:07.380]  And now we're friends for life.
[26:07.380 --> 26:08.820]  So yeah, so shout out to Kelsey.
[26:08.820 --> 26:10.700]  She got us some pretty decent seats over there
[26:10.700 --> 26:11.540]  at the Comedy Works.
[26:11.540 --> 26:12.380]  Pretty perfect seats.
[26:12.380 --> 26:13.200]  Well, thank you, Kelsey.
[26:13.200 --> 26:14.040]  Quite perfect seats.
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.300]  Leg room and a great view.
[26:16.300 --> 26:17.460]  Leg room at Comedy Works.
[26:17.460 --> 26:19.180]  I might have to check out this other spot.
[26:19.180 --> 26:20.420]  Yeah, dude, it was nice.
[26:20.420 --> 26:22.300]  That's not a thing at the original location.
[26:22.300 --> 26:23.500]  Be me.
[26:23.500 --> 26:24.900]  So thanks to our friends at Comedy Works.
[26:24.900 --> 26:27.020]  Big thanks to Frosty McNuggets for throwing that party.
[26:27.020 --> 26:29.020]  Thanks to everybody that showed up.
[26:29.020 --> 26:30.420]  So was that your favorite part, Clint?
[26:30.420 --> 26:32.460]  Was the comedy show and all the cool ass people
[26:32.460 --> 26:33.300]  you got to meet?
[26:33.300 --> 26:34.380]  That stood out.
[26:34.880 --> 26:35.720]  Yeah, all the cool people.
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.520]  Everybody had such a good vibe to them.
[26:37.520 --> 26:40.600]  I mean, the whole event was like fairly well run.
[26:40.600 --> 26:44.320]  I didn't see any like huge problems or anything like that.
[26:44.320 --> 26:46.600]  But there wasn't a lot of food going around.
[26:46.600 --> 26:49.200]  That could have been better maybe for next year.
[26:49.200 --> 26:53.120]  Definitely could have used some food vending inside.
[26:53.120 --> 26:54.160]  But I don't know.
[26:54.160 --> 26:56.120]  I think maybe we just didn't see it.
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.360]  There was so many people there.
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.240]  So that was fun.
[26:59.240 --> 27:02.240]  Food vending inside would take up boot space for exhibitors.
[27:02.780 --> 27:05.220]  The expo was massive.
[27:05.220 --> 27:06.060]  Two days there.
[27:06.060 --> 27:08.100]  I tried to walk around a little bit.
[27:08.100 --> 27:11.940]  I know I only saw maybe 20% of it.
[27:11.940 --> 27:14.060]  There's a subway inside the place.
[27:14.060 --> 27:15.580]  There's a cafe inside the place.
[27:15.580 --> 27:16.820]  So there's food.
[27:16.820 --> 27:18.620]  We just didn't find, you guys didn't find the subway.
[27:18.620 --> 27:19.460]  It's in there.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.380]  We were hanging out at the booth.
[27:20.380 --> 27:21.220]  It was fun.
[27:21.220 --> 27:23.860]  I made it to the booth and to the men's vape lounge.
[27:23.860 --> 27:25.860]  It's as far as I got all weekend.
[27:25.860 --> 27:26.860]  I didn't get to go see,
[27:26.860 --> 27:28.820]  I wanted to go hang out with Colin Gordon for a moment.
[27:28.820 --> 27:30.260]  Didn't get to go see him.
[27:30.260 --> 27:31.900]  I wanted to go see a couple of people.
[27:32.560 --> 27:34.120]  I made a quick stop at the Oregon Elite Seeds booth
[27:34.120 --> 27:35.720]  and the Seeds Here Now booth just to say,
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.000]  hey, what's up and give them hugs.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.080]  Cause we work together.
[27:38.080 --> 27:39.960]  And I was back at the booth as quickly as I could.
[27:39.960 --> 27:41.200]  I was nervous away from the booth.
[27:41.200 --> 27:43.200]  It felt like my post was left unmanned.
[27:43.200 --> 27:44.080]  And I trust you guys.
[27:44.080 --> 27:45.680]  I know you got it, but I was still like,
[27:45.680 --> 27:46.520]  man, I gotta be there.
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.480]  My face is on the fucking banner.
[27:48.480 --> 27:49.320]  Like, yeah.
[27:49.320 --> 27:50.840]  So I was waiting to get back there.
[27:50.840 --> 27:54.240]  It honestly felt like a mad rush for Seeds this year.
[27:54.240 --> 27:56.560]  As far as people going to like just-
[27:56.560 --> 27:59.680]  I had a number of other people mention that
[28:00.500 --> 28:04.140]  the crowds were good around each Seed booth.
[28:04.140 --> 28:05.540]  Yeah.
[28:05.540 --> 28:07.940]  It was people who were doing other stuff
[28:07.940 --> 28:11.040]  like heavy high-end extraction equipment,
[28:12.180 --> 28:13.180]  stuff like that.
[28:13.180 --> 28:16.660]  And they pretty much all uniformly mentioned like,
[28:16.660 --> 28:19.900]  seed companies look like that's the hotspot this month.
[28:19.900 --> 28:21.380]  That's how it always is at those events.
[28:21.380 --> 28:22.660]  That's why they spread us out.
[28:22.660 --> 28:24.620]  I don't know if you noticed, it was about every-
[28:24.620 --> 28:25.460]  It was pretty strategic.
[28:25.460 --> 28:27.300]  We were opposite sides and about three down
[28:27.300 --> 28:29.060]  from each other every time there'd be a seed breeder.
[28:29.240 --> 28:31.000]  They knew what they were getting into.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.040]  This was the third or fifth Indow.
[28:33.040 --> 28:34.640]  I really can't remember how many there have been.
[28:34.640 --> 28:36.280]  There's so many of these events
[28:36.280 --> 28:38.120]  and they do them in the same building.
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.660]  And so they all look the same to me, not to be eventist,
[28:41.660 --> 28:43.980]  but it's just a bunch of booths with fucking people
[28:43.980 --> 28:46.120]  and like the cup and the expo
[28:46.120 --> 28:47.320]  and they all look the same by now.
[28:47.320 --> 28:49.280]  So I don't know how many there have been,
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.040]  but yeah, the seed breeders, that's where it's at.
[28:52.040 --> 28:53.020]  We all got our fair share.
[28:53.020 --> 28:54.480]  That's what I love that nobody,
[28:54.480 --> 28:57.860]  like we all had basically the same nice amount of flow.
[28:57.960 --> 28:59.040]  I talk about it like they're bands.
[28:59.040 --> 29:00.320]  Everyone's gonna like certain bands.
[29:00.320 --> 29:02.600]  And so nobody got all of it and nobody got left out.
[29:02.600 --> 29:04.120]  That was pretty cool that we all got a fair amount
[29:04.120 --> 29:05.320]  of business this weekend.
[29:05.320 --> 29:07.280]  I really enjoyed that.
[29:07.280 --> 29:08.320]  Clint, did we wrap up your part?
[29:08.320 --> 29:09.200]  I don't wanna cut you off.
[29:09.200 --> 29:10.520]  I appreciate you, Jeff.
[29:10.520 --> 29:11.920]  Yeah, that was everything.
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.480]  I mean, just shout outs to everybody that came by
[29:14.480 --> 29:16.800]  and everybody was really super fucking cool.
[29:16.800 --> 29:19.200]  Dude, you were pitching the podcast hard to everybody
[29:19.200 --> 29:20.800]  and doing a really good job with it.
[29:20.800 --> 29:22.700]  So I bet you there are 20 to 50,
[29:22.700 --> 29:24.280]  maybe a hundred people listening right now
[29:24.280 --> 29:27.200]  because you gave them a Grow From Your Heart podcast flyer
[29:27.220 --> 29:28.420]  and you guys helped out with that also.
[29:28.420 --> 29:29.740]  So fucking thank you guys for that.
[29:29.740 --> 29:30.580]  Hell yeah, dude.
[29:30.580 --> 29:33.600]  I wanna grow this thing and then if you guys will play it.
[29:33.600 --> 29:37.320]  I mean, the Grow lessons are just so valuable
[29:37.320 --> 29:40.620]  that I don't know, it's free information.
[29:40.620 --> 29:42.140]  Please go back and listen.
[29:42.140 --> 29:43.760]  Yes, target audience.
[29:43.760 --> 29:44.600]  We were hitting them.
[29:44.600 --> 29:45.760]  They were there that day.
[29:47.180 --> 29:49.140]  Some of my favorite stuff at the event,
[29:49.140 --> 29:50.160]  I just loved all the people
[29:50.160 --> 29:51.580]  that wanted to fucking meet me, bro.
[29:51.580 --> 29:52.420]  That is really cool.
[29:52.420 --> 29:53.240]  It feels good.
[29:53.240 --> 29:54.180]  I said, it's recharging.
[29:54.200 --> 29:57.320]  It's overwhelming because it's a lot of people to meet
[29:57.320 --> 29:58.840]  and hands to shake and hugs to give
[29:58.840 --> 30:00.800]  and names to try to fucking remember,
[30:00.800 --> 30:02.000]  but it feels so good.
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.840]  I don't know, that's just all the social recharge
[30:04.840 --> 30:06.920]  that a person needs just to feel good about themselves.
[30:06.920 --> 30:09.040]  So that's a big ego boost and a big,
[30:09.040 --> 30:10.380]  if I were like a SIM video game,
[30:10.380 --> 30:12.000]  my social meter would just be filled up
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.140]  for the next fucking four months.
[30:13.140 --> 30:13.980]  I'm cool on that.
[30:13.980 --> 30:14.800]  Thank you.
[30:15.840 --> 30:19.320]  This year was the first year we brought our own big booth
[30:19.320 --> 30:20.160]  to the event.
[30:20.160 --> 30:22.620]  Before I've shared with other vendors and other breeders
[30:22.640 --> 30:24.520]  and I've done things with other companies
[30:24.520 --> 30:25.760]  and I wasn't there by myself.
[30:25.760 --> 30:28.160]  We didn't put our name on the booth this year.
[30:28.160 --> 30:29.600]  It was iRegenetics.
[30:29.600 --> 30:30.440]  I brought-
[30:30.440 --> 30:31.280]  Just out and proud.
[30:31.280 --> 30:32.120]  It was beautiful.
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.080]  I brought my banner.
[30:33.080 --> 30:33.960]  I brought my crew.
[30:33.960 --> 30:35.880]  I hired the team that I wanted there.
[30:35.880 --> 30:37.600]  We did it my way, not to be,
[30:37.600 --> 30:38.960]  we did it your guys' fucking way.
[30:38.960 --> 30:39.780]  You guys had fun.
[30:39.780 --> 30:40.620]  I was like, here are the seeds.
[30:40.620 --> 30:42.520]  This is how much they cost to make this shit happen.
[30:42.520 --> 30:43.880]  This fucking, I kind of got to let you guys
[30:43.880 --> 30:44.720]  do what you want.
[30:44.720 --> 30:45.560]  It was nice.
[30:45.560 --> 30:48.120]  We've all worked enough retail and enough events,
[30:48.120 --> 30:48.960]  stuff like that,
[30:48.960 --> 30:51.200]  that we all just dropped into a pro rhythm
[30:51.200 --> 30:52.040]  right from the jump.
[30:52.060 --> 30:53.300]  That went pretty well.
[30:53.300 --> 30:55.100]  Clint's not super well versed in seeds,
[30:55.100 --> 30:57.180]  so he was doing well at pitching the podcast.
[30:57.180 --> 30:58.740]  Mike is pretty well versed at seeds
[30:58.740 --> 30:59.660]  and has been a bud tender,
[30:59.660 --> 31:01.940]  so he was doing pretty good with strain recommendations.
[31:01.940 --> 31:04.140]  You guys were finding your niches and doing a good job.
[31:04.140 --> 31:05.900]  Helper Monkey over here was super popular
[31:05.900 --> 31:07.620]  because of his vertical grow.
[31:07.620 --> 31:09.140]  People wanted vertical grow advice.
[31:09.140 --> 31:10.700]  They remembered him from the show.
[31:10.700 --> 31:11.860]  So that was kind of cool.
[31:11.860 --> 31:13.060]  And he's just spunky too.
[31:13.060 --> 31:13.900]  So that was fucking cool.
[31:13.900 --> 31:15.180]  He's energetic.
[31:15.180 --> 31:17.220]  Man, I'm sure you met a cool guy.
[31:17.220 --> 31:18.500]  I'm glad you met up with one of our friends.
[31:18.500 --> 31:19.740]  I'm not going to spill too much of your beans,
[31:19.740 --> 31:21.140]  but you made a really good contact.
[31:21.160 --> 31:22.560]  I'm kind of proud of you for.
[31:22.560 --> 31:24.360]  Yeah, this guy's awesome, man.
[31:24.360 --> 31:25.720]  He kind of takes what I do
[31:25.720 --> 31:28.320]  and I don't want to give too much away on him,
[31:28.320 --> 31:29.800]  but he kind of does it on a bigger scale
[31:29.800 --> 31:31.040]  than what I'm doing right now.
[31:31.040 --> 31:32.240]  We'll share that when the time is right.
[31:32.240 --> 31:34.360]  Yeah, it's going to be.
[31:34.360 --> 31:36.360]  Yeah, I hope I can collaborate.
[31:36.360 --> 31:37.400]  We're best friends now, moment.
[31:37.400 --> 31:38.700]  It was nice.
[31:38.700 --> 31:41.080]  I got a couple of really cool opportunities.
[31:41.080 --> 31:42.480]  There are a couple of things you guys heard of
[31:42.480 --> 31:43.320]  that are coming up.
[31:43.320 --> 31:45.040]  Hopefully if they email back,
[31:45.040 --> 31:47.400]  there will be some really cool opportunities.
[31:47.400 --> 31:49.360]  One of my other favorite things that happened this year
[31:49.360 --> 31:50.200]  at the Endo Expo.
[31:50.460 --> 31:51.420]  I was kind of segue into this
[31:51.420 --> 31:53.700]  and I sidetracked my damn stone self.
[31:53.700 --> 31:55.180]  This is the first year we brought the big booth.
[31:55.180 --> 31:57.460]  This is the first time I brought the team and the crew
[31:57.460 --> 32:00.820]  and it wasn't me joining somebody else like the little dog.
[32:00.820 --> 32:02.620]  In this industry, in this community,
[32:04.780 --> 32:06.580]  people try to act like there's a hierarchy
[32:06.580 --> 32:08.460]  and people are better than people.
[32:08.460 --> 32:09.900]  That's just how every industry is.
[32:09.900 --> 32:11.340]  Every business goes that way.
[32:11.340 --> 32:13.300]  Every clique, every community.
[32:13.300 --> 32:14.500]  This year, some of the people
[32:14.500 --> 32:17.020]  that have had their noses up to iRegenetics,
[32:17.020 --> 32:18.300]  they fucking put their heads down
[32:18.320 --> 32:20.360]  and looked me in the eye and nodded their heads
[32:20.360 --> 32:23.240]  and they finally realized we're fucking here.
[32:23.240 --> 32:25.240]  Clint kept saying it as a kind of a funny joke
[32:25.240 --> 32:26.520]  by the end of the day Sunday.
[32:26.520 --> 32:28.160]  We were tired and high and exhausted
[32:28.160 --> 32:29.000]  and by the end of Sunday,
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.720]  Clint's pitch was, we're iRegenetics
[32:30.720 --> 32:32.120]  and we're not fucking around.
[32:32.120 --> 32:33.760]  But that's not a joke, you guys.
[32:33.760 --> 32:35.920]  People finally realized we're here, we're something real.
[32:35.920 --> 32:38.080]  It's here to stay, it's not going anywhere.
[32:38.080 --> 32:39.480]  This is the first event when people went,
[32:39.480 --> 32:41.680]  oh shit, we can't, we see them coming.
[32:41.680 --> 32:43.760]  That's a seed company we gotta pay attention to.
[32:43.760 --> 32:45.080]  So we're there now.
[32:45.080 --> 32:47.360]  We got on the team, they let us in this time, bro.
[32:47.540 --> 32:48.860]  We're sitting at the big boys table.
[32:48.860 --> 32:50.780]  I would literally watch people circling
[32:50.780 --> 32:52.420]  because you had so many people
[32:52.420 --> 32:54.100]  wanting to take selfies with you
[32:54.100 --> 32:56.940]  and just meet you that they would circle around
[32:56.940 --> 32:58.660]  and you'd see them come back 10 minutes later
[32:58.660 --> 33:00.140]  like, okay, Jeff's finally free,
[33:00.140 --> 33:02.460]  let me go talk to him and you see him light up.
[33:02.460 --> 33:03.300]  It was a great feeling, man.
[33:03.300 --> 33:04.180]  That's fucking funny.
[33:04.180 --> 33:05.020]  I don't get to see that
[33:05.020 --> 33:07.980]  because I don't get to look past two people.
[33:07.980 --> 33:08.900]  I see the guy I'm talking to
[33:08.900 --> 33:10.820]  and I kind of make eye contact with the guy behind him
[33:10.820 --> 33:12.660]  and nod like, you're gonna be next, bro.
[33:12.660 --> 33:14.060]  I let them know that I acknowledge them
[33:14.060 --> 33:15.260]  and I just try to focus.
[33:16.240 --> 33:18.080]  So that's fucking great to know
[33:18.080 --> 33:19.440]  that people are looping around
[33:19.440 --> 33:21.720]  and coming back and enthusiastic.
[33:21.720 --> 33:25.120]  Yeah, and even a lot of companies support us.
[33:25.120 --> 33:28.120]  Well, it wasn't even just like average people.
[33:28.120 --> 33:31.200]  There's a lot of companies who are super stoked on
[33:31.200 --> 33:34.800]  our booth and just being a part of what you're doing.
[33:34.800 --> 33:37.260]  Veg Bloom came by, New Mill came by.
[33:37.260 --> 33:39.960]  I got a really cool zip up hoodie from New Mill.
[33:39.960 --> 33:41.280]  That thing is so crazy.
[33:41.280 --> 33:42.120]  Man, that thing's nice.
[33:42.120 --> 33:43.160]  It was a lot of fun.
[33:43.180 --> 33:45.420]  The conversation happened five or six times
[33:45.420 --> 33:46.260]  with different people.
[33:46.260 --> 33:47.540]  They'd come up and go,
[33:47.540 --> 33:49.540]  hey, Jeff, I just wanted to introduce myself.
[33:49.540 --> 33:50.820]  I'm so-and-so.
[33:50.820 --> 33:54.140]  I run blank companies, Instagram,
[33:54.140 --> 33:55.580]  and you guys would go, oh!
[33:57.300 --> 33:59.620]  It's fun to finally meet those people.
[33:59.620 --> 34:03.060]  We've been interacting every other day for two years.
[34:03.060 --> 34:04.540]  They send me products and shit.
[34:04.540 --> 34:06.060]  I use the products and I've been growing
[34:06.060 --> 34:07.220]  like new millennium, new,
[34:07.220 --> 34:08.980]  I know that guy for a while, but like, yeah.
[34:08.980 --> 34:09.820]  I know who you're talking about.
[34:09.820 --> 34:12.940]  And I'm like, oh, Green Dot was the main one
[34:13.720 --> 34:14.760]  that I was like, bro, we talk like every day.
[34:14.760 --> 34:15.920]  And it was just kind of fun.
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.960]  Yeah, that's just a lot of fun.
[34:16.960 --> 34:18.040]  And he's a dreaded white guy too.
[34:18.040 --> 34:19.160]  So it was even more fun to be like,
[34:19.160 --> 34:21.880]  hey, two dreaded white guys, high five.
[34:21.880 --> 34:22.920]  It's just funny for me.
[34:22.920 --> 34:24.360]  Like we know that everybody's watching.
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.460]  It's extra funny.
[34:26.920 --> 34:27.840]  There was a lot of that.
[34:27.840 --> 34:31.400]  And real energizing getting to meet
[34:31.400 --> 34:33.400]  a bunch of fans of the show coming up,
[34:33.400 --> 34:35.600]  just wanting to say hi and shake our hands.
[34:37.320 --> 34:39.440]  The people at the booth next to us were confused.
[34:39.460 --> 34:42.900]  Yeah, really energizes our desire
[34:42.900 --> 34:44.580]  to do the show and do it well.
[34:45.500 --> 34:46.660]  That was funny though.
[34:46.660 --> 34:50.060]  The people next to us just not getting anything going on.
[34:50.060 --> 34:52.820]  And we just had a constant like crowd of people.
[34:52.820 --> 34:54.460]  And they had free food.
[34:54.460 --> 34:55.860]  Yeah, that was pretty tight.
[34:55.860 --> 34:57.340]  How do you not?
[34:57.340 --> 34:58.260]  I don't know, man.
[34:58.260 --> 35:00.100]  I really appreciate everybody coming out.
[35:00.100 --> 35:01.500]  But they were super nice.
[35:01.500 --> 35:02.820]  They were super nice guys.
[35:02.820 --> 35:04.140]  Everybody at the event was super nice.
[35:04.140 --> 35:06.460]  I got to hang out with Swerve from the Cali Connection.
[35:06.460 --> 35:07.660]  Just spend a few minutes.
[35:07.680 --> 35:09.240]  That dude's been at it since,
[35:10.440 --> 35:11.800]  while we were all figuring it out,
[35:11.800 --> 35:13.400]  he was doing it already.
[35:13.400 --> 35:16.080]  Got to hang out with James Bean from Seeds Here Now.
[35:16.080 --> 35:18.360]  That's awesome because we do a lot of work together.
[35:18.360 --> 35:19.200]  I just got to meet a lot of,
[35:19.200 --> 35:21.680]  I got to see Covert from Covert Genetics.
[35:21.680 --> 35:23.080]  Got to see old Chris Casas.
[35:23.080 --> 35:23.920]  Got to see a bunch of people
[35:23.920 --> 35:25.320]  that we don't normally get to see.
[35:25.320 --> 35:27.320]  But we made a lot of good friends.
[35:27.320 --> 35:29.120]  Got a lot of great gifts.
[35:29.120 --> 35:30.560]  Got a lot of business cards, bro.
[35:30.560 --> 35:32.560]  It's going to be a long emailing session
[35:32.560 --> 35:34.080]  on today and tomorrow.
[35:34.080 --> 35:37.560]  Yeah, I've been wading through emails already.
[35:38.260 --> 35:39.220]  It was a fun expo.
[35:39.220 --> 35:41.620]  If you missed it, you missed out,
[35:41.620 --> 35:44.180]  you should definitely be on it for next year.
[35:44.180 --> 35:45.260]  Yes, the Indo Expo.
[35:45.260 --> 35:46.220]  Pay attention to that.
[35:46.220 --> 35:48.980]  I saw a lot of people on the Friday and Thursday before it
[35:48.980 --> 35:50.780]  saying, hey, how do I get Indo Expo passes?
[35:50.780 --> 35:52.340]  Bro, bro.
[35:52.340 --> 35:53.780]  For like six months before the Indo,
[35:53.780 --> 35:55.100]  those people start flooding people
[35:55.100 --> 35:56.700]  with emails and advertisements.
[35:56.700 --> 35:57.580]  Get your passes.
[35:57.580 --> 35:58.660]  Don't sleep on it next year.
[35:58.660 --> 36:02.900]  So let's tell them finally what they missed out on
[36:02.900 --> 36:05.060]  since you didn't release what you were going to do
[36:05.060 --> 36:06.020]  before the expo.
[36:06.040 --> 36:08.240]  Let's tell them what free packs they missed out on.
[36:08.240 --> 36:09.120]  You're going to taunt everybody.
[36:09.120 --> 36:11.040]  A lot of people saw it on social media.
[36:11.040 --> 36:15.680]  I was giving away free packs of GMO to Arise
[36:15.680 --> 36:17.880]  to everybody that came to the booth and bought a pack of seed.
[36:17.880 --> 36:21.320]  So yeah, free GMO to Arise with almost every purchase,
[36:21.320 --> 36:22.160]  I think.
[36:24.040 --> 36:26.240]  Should we tell them about the other cool thing we gave away?
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.800]  What else did we give away, Mike?
[36:27.800 --> 36:28.640]  Oh, yes.
[36:28.640 --> 36:29.560]  A minder unit.
[36:29.560 --> 36:32.480]  Yes, our friends at PL Grow Systems were kind enough
[36:32.480 --> 36:36.180]  to give away a PL minder unit to the person
[36:36.180 --> 36:38.980]  who spent the most money at my booth this weekend.
[36:38.980 --> 36:41.880]  It was a random surprise for somebody that,
[36:43.380 --> 36:45.340]  I know that person's happy right now.
[36:45.340 --> 36:47.940]  I know he's, he almost had, he didn't want me,
[36:47.940 --> 36:50.260]  he wouldn't look at me because he had a little drippy
[36:50.260 --> 36:51.620]  of a little bit of a tear in his eye.
[36:51.620 --> 36:52.460]  And if he wasn't my friend,
[36:52.460 --> 36:53.660]  I wouldn't say that out loud like that.
[36:53.660 --> 36:55.340]  But he had a little bit of a,
[36:55.340 --> 36:57.300]  I'm glad his beard was hiding his tears, bro.
[36:57.300 --> 36:58.500]  Happy birthday, big fella.
[36:58.500 --> 36:59.340]  Happy birthday, bro.
[36:59.340 --> 37:00.160]  We all love you.
[37:00.160 --> 37:01.040]  Everybody here at the Grow From Your Heart Podcast,
[37:01.040 --> 37:01.880]  we're picking on you.
[37:02.140 --> 37:03.460]  Only because we fucking love you, bro.
[37:03.460 --> 37:05.540]  Your family, I'd give you a big hug if you were right
[37:05.540 --> 37:06.380]  in front of me.
[37:06.380 --> 37:07.200]  We only roast the ones we love.
[37:07.200 --> 37:08.380]  Yes, I would rub my beard on yours
[37:08.380 --> 37:11.100]  and we'd change beard fungus and we'd be bros forever.
[37:11.100 --> 37:14.020]  And I only wanted to bring that up so next year people.
[37:14.020 --> 37:14.860]  They know, they come.
[37:14.860 --> 37:16.060]  They know, you know, get there early.
[37:16.060 --> 37:17.420]  Free shit, dude.
[37:17.420 --> 37:19.580]  We weren't the only booth giving away cool shit.
[37:19.580 --> 37:21.180]  There was a lot of that going on this year.
[37:21.180 --> 37:22.740]  Every booth was giving out some shit.
[37:22.740 --> 37:23.580]  It was fun.
[37:23.580 --> 37:25.020]  And if you didn't get enough stickers at the event,
[37:25.020 --> 37:26.420]  you weren't trying hard enough.
[37:26.420 --> 37:27.380]  Yeah.
[37:27.380 --> 37:28.380]  And there were stickers for days.
[37:28.380 --> 37:29.540]  All right, guys, I feel like we've rambled
[37:29.560 --> 37:32.440]  for close to 40 minutes on an Endo Expo recap.
[37:32.440 --> 37:33.880]  We got to talk about Theo.
[37:33.880 --> 37:36.640]  We got to talk about all the wonderful friends we saw.
[37:36.640 --> 37:38.360]  We got to talk about all the thanks
[37:38.360 --> 37:39.880]  that we need to give to everybody.
[37:39.880 --> 37:40.720]  Thanks.
[37:40.720 --> 37:41.540]  We had fun, you guys.
[37:41.540 --> 37:42.480]  I want to thank my crew.
[37:42.480 --> 37:43.880]  Mike, you fucking killed it, bro.
[37:43.880 --> 37:44.720]  You're awesome.
[37:44.720 --> 37:46.240]  Helper Monkey, you were only there for one day.
[37:46.240 --> 37:47.360]  You fucking crushed it, bro.
[37:47.360 --> 37:48.200]  Thank you.
[37:48.200 --> 37:49.040]  Thanks, man.
[37:49.040 --> 37:49.860]  Clint, I almost called you Mike, bro.
[37:49.860 --> 37:50.700]  I apologize.
[37:50.700 --> 37:51.520]  I'll never do that again.
[37:51.520 --> 37:52.360]  Oh my God.
[37:52.360 --> 37:53.200]  I'm sorry.
[37:53.200 --> 37:54.020]  I'm sorry, dude.
[37:54.020 --> 37:54.860]  Don't look at me like that, bro.
[37:54.860 --> 37:55.700]  I'm sorry.
[37:55.700 --> 37:56.520]  I'm sorry, bro.
[37:56.520 --> 37:57.360]  Can we still be friends?
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.000]  I don't know what you were thinking.
[37:59.920 --> 38:00.760]  I'm going to forgive you this time.
[38:00.760 --> 38:01.600]  You were thinking very handsome and articulate.
[38:01.600 --> 38:02.640]  I get this forgiveness.
[38:02.640 --> 38:03.480]  Anyway.
[38:03.480 --> 38:04.300]  All right.
[38:04.300 --> 38:05.140]  Hey, Clint, thank you, bro.
[38:05.140 --> 38:06.400]  You kicked ass at the Endo Expo.
[38:06.400 --> 38:08.160]  Man, you guys carried my shit out for me Sunday.
[38:08.160 --> 38:09.440]  I didn't carry anything.
[38:09.440 --> 38:10.720]  I was like, what do I pick up?
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.200]  And you guys were like, fuck it, you own the company.
[38:12.200 --> 38:14.320]  And I was like, well, then I guess I don't carry shit.
[38:14.320 --> 38:15.600]  I'll open the car door.
[38:15.600 --> 38:16.600]  You guys kicked ass.
[38:16.600 --> 38:17.520]  You cleaned up everything.
[38:17.520 --> 38:19.000]  You fucking helped all the people that came.
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.480]  You greeted everybody.
[38:20.480 --> 38:21.320]  You guys are awesome, man.
[38:21.320 --> 38:22.320]  So I can't wait to do this more
[38:22.320 --> 38:23.600]  and take you guys with me to more shows
[38:23.600 --> 38:24.640]  and kick some more ass, bro.

[38:28.700 --> 38:31.100]  Yeah, if we can go to other states,
[38:31.100 --> 38:32.740]  it'd be great to meet people out there too
[38:32.740 --> 38:35.220]  and then try to spread the podcast like that too.

[42:32.540 --> 42:33.380]  Mike went to dinner with somebody else.
[42:33.380 --> 42:34.220]  So he had a good time.
[42:34.220 --> 42:35.200]  I went out with a friend.
[42:35.200 --> 42:37.000]  What'd you guys all have for dinner?
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.360]  Well, we went to the hotel room.
[42:38.360 --> 42:40.360]  First, we took fucking, allegedly,
[42:40.360 --> 42:43.240]  Matt and I took gnarly dabs in the car.
[42:43.240 --> 42:44.800]  Like, choke you to death.
[42:44.800 --> 42:46.000]  Off the property of the hotel.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.580]  We made sure because my hotel,
[42:47.600 --> 42:51.240]  they remind me six or eight times in my check-in process
[42:51.240 --> 42:53.920]  that I can't consume cannabis in, around, near,
[42:53.920 --> 42:55.800]  or while I'm thinking about that hotel.
[42:55.800 --> 42:57.680]  They're like, you can leave here and do whatever you want,
[42:57.680 --> 43:00.080]  but please don't even get your pipe out in the parking lot.
[43:00.080 --> 43:00.960]  I'm like, I'm cool with that.
[43:00.960 --> 43:02.380]  So we go off their property
[43:02.380 --> 43:04.000]  and we may have got heavily medicated.
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.680]  And while we were doing that, bro,
[43:05.680 --> 43:08.240]  I ordered fucking pizzas, bro, to the room.
[43:08.240 --> 43:11.280]  We sat on the fucking chairs in the room with no shoes on
[43:11.280 --> 43:13.080]  and we just ate pizza like lazy bitches.
[43:13.080 --> 43:16.080]  And it was the most perfect dinner we could have had.
[43:16.080 --> 43:18.820]  We'd been on our feet and around people all day.
[43:18.820 --> 43:21.300]  It was basically silent other than a couple of,
[43:21.300 --> 43:22.300]  that's a good pizza.
[43:22.300 --> 43:23.940]  And it's even funnier because you were staying
[43:23.940 --> 43:25.780]  in like a fucking five-star hotel
[43:25.780 --> 43:28.340]  and there's these four Dirty Stoners fucking eating,
[43:28.340 --> 43:30.700]  or three of us eating pizza
[43:30.700 --> 43:33.180]  in this perfect super baller fucking place.
[43:33.180 --> 43:34.020]  It was great.
[43:34.020 --> 43:35.660]  It was exactly what we needed at the time.
[43:35.660 --> 43:36.900]  It just needed some pizza.

[43:48.280 --> 43:49.120]  Oh, fuck, I'm sorry, man.
[43:49.120 --> 43:50.960]  That was pretty good.
[43:50.960 --> 43:51.800]  You're good at this.
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.920]  Oh, I like this game.
[43:52.920 --> 43:54.440]  Cannabis will take you places.
[43:54.440 --> 43:55.280]  It does.
[43:55.280 --> 43:57.920]  Guys, we made so many new friends.
[43:57.920 --> 43:58.920]  I had such a good time.

[44:07.240 --> 44:08.720]  Thanks for saying hi, everybody.
[44:08.720 --> 44:11.120]  It was a pleasure to meet everybody.
[44:11.140 --> 44:14.860]  And I can't wait to see

[44:19.340 --> 44:20.940]  And at the Dude Grows Cup.
[44:20.940 --> 44:23.260]  Wow, why did my voice sound like I was fucking Barry White?
[44:23.260 --> 44:24.500]  Yeah, man, that was nice.
[44:24.500 --> 44:25.340]  Let's go with this.

[44:31.860 --> 44:34.220]  and every time I remember, it makes me smile.
[44:34.220 --> 44:36.020]  It's a thing that's gonna happen.
[44:36.020 --> 44:38.180]  Yeah, and then the guys from Normal came by
[44:38.180 --> 44:40.540]  to thank you again to those guys for what they do.
[44:40.560 --> 44:41.880]  Go be an activist.
[44:41.880 --> 44:42.880]  Yes, get it going.
[44:42.880 --> 44:44.120]  All right, boys and girls, we're gonna wrap this up
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.160]  or we could ramble all day.

[46:36.120 --> 46:37.920]  A sense of achieving
[46:37.920 --> 46:39.520]  To know I'm contributing
[46:39.520 --> 46:41.200]  Doing my part to win
