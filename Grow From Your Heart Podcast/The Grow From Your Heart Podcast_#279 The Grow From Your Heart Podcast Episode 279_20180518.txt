[00:03.070 --> 00:20.660]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:20.660 --> 00:24.220]  It's time for episode number 279 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.500 --> 00:28.420]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:28.420 --> 00:30.380]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.460 --> 00:34.140]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:34.220 --> 00:37.100]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.500 --> 00:40.900]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:40.920 --> 00:43.740]  My friends call me Ross DeJeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.180 --> 00:46.060]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you.
[00:46.060 --> 00:48.020]  Shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band,
[00:48.060 --> 00:51.940]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:52.020 --> 00:54.220]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:56.100 --> 00:59.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am dabbed the fuck out today.
[00:59.820 --> 01:02.620]  It is a happy Saturday afternoon. It's been kind of nice.
[01:02.620 --> 01:05.980]  It's been super cold in Colorado, but today it is a nice sunshiny day.
[01:06.260 --> 01:09.420]  It's still like 50 degrees out there, but that's nice for what it is right now.
[01:10.100 --> 01:14.340]  I am taking some dabs of some Durban poison live resin from CSC.
[01:14.340 --> 01:17.340]  It's the concentrate supply company. I picked it up over at three rivers.
[01:18.140 --> 01:22.700]  It's super saucy. It's got some crystals in it. It tastes freaking amazing.
[01:22.700 --> 01:25.660]  Holy shit. I smoked almost a whole gram. I picked it up last night.
[01:26.060 --> 01:27.860]  I smoked a bunch of dabs out of it last night.
[01:27.860 --> 01:30.140]  I smoked a bunch of dabs out of it today on Instagram live.
[01:30.380 --> 01:33.220]  It will be gone as soon as this podcast ends. I'm going to finish it.
[01:33.700 --> 01:38.540]  Super delicious Durban poison sativa dabs. Got me rambly. The flavor was amazing.
[01:38.540 --> 01:43.300]  It's got my head spinning. I started off the day. Uh, just, I woke up alone at home.
[01:43.300 --> 01:47.220]  There's nobody here. There's just like lazy and bored. It's Saturday.
[01:47.220 --> 01:49.420]  It was nothing going on. It's like, I got to get my fucking head.
[01:49.420 --> 01:52.820]  Woke up, sat some food and got myself moving, chilled out for a little while,
[01:52.820 --> 01:54.620]  handled some chores, did some house stuff.
[01:54.620 --> 01:57.580]  And then I went and got on Instagram live and took a bunch of dabs with
[01:57.580 --> 01:59.860]  everybody on Instagram live. And that really got my brain moving.
[02:00.060 --> 02:03.740]  The Durban poison dabs and the interaction on Instagram live really got my brain
[02:03.740 --> 02:06.060]  firing in the right direction. It worked perfect.
[02:06.140 --> 02:08.420]  So thanks to everybody who was joining me on Instagram live.
[02:08.420 --> 02:10.740]  If you guys that don't follow me on Instagram, I really think you should.
[02:10.940 --> 02:13.180]  It's an IRI underscore genetics on Instagram.
[02:13.180 --> 02:17.540]  I R I E underscore G E N E T I C S on Instagram. Check me out.
[02:17.820 --> 02:21.100]  I do Instagram live videos occasionally and go and talk about whatever's going on
[02:21.100 --> 02:24.460]  with my day. I take some dabs and I ramble. People ask questions. Uh,
[02:24.460 --> 02:27.220]  sometimes I answer those questions in the live feed,
[02:27.220 --> 02:29.900]  but then I'll come back and record them and answer them on the podcast.
[02:29.900 --> 02:33.580]  And that's one of the questions for today actually came from an Instagram live
[02:33.580 --> 02:35.660]  feed, but we'll get to that in just a couple of minutes.
[02:36.340 --> 02:39.060]  What else are we going to talk about? You guys remember,
[02:39.060 --> 02:41.940]  I talked a couple of weeks ago about getting sick ever since I got sick.
[02:42.260 --> 02:46.700]  When I take dabs, I have just been getting wrecked high. Like, Holy shit.
[02:47.060 --> 02:50.780]  I probably smoke half as much hash in the past few days as I used to before I got
[02:50.780 --> 02:53.980]  sick. And I just had this killer chest cold and a head cold.
[02:54.300 --> 02:57.300]  Everybody at the grow got it. It passed around. Everybody around here got sick.
[02:57.300 --> 03:01.300]  But since then I've just been able to get stupid high just off of a couple of
[03:01.300 --> 03:03.900]  dabs. It's been kind of nice. Uh, some,
[03:03.900 --> 03:06.100]  it's kind of not also because my friends will be like,
[03:06.100 --> 03:07.460]  here's a big ass dab and I'll take it.
[03:07.460 --> 03:10.300]  And by God and I just got to sit here for 10 minutes and figure my fucking life
[03:10.300 --> 03:14.140]  out again. But I've just been getting lit off dabs lately. It's kind of nice.
[03:14.220 --> 03:17.460]  I don't know if it's got anything to do with when I was sick or if I'm eating a
[03:17.460 --> 03:19.300]  little differently cause I got sick. And you know,
[03:19.300 --> 03:20.900]  when you get sick you try to be a little more healthy.
[03:20.900 --> 03:22.380]  You start eating better and you're like, I got sick.
[03:22.380 --> 03:24.740]  I better eat more fruit and cut out all the crap. So I'm doing that again.
[03:24.900 --> 03:26.740]  Maybe that's got something to do with it, but Holy crap,
[03:26.740 --> 03:30.420]  I've been getting lit up by has been getting red again. It is pretty nice.
[03:30.780 --> 03:33.940]  Another thing I want to mention, uh, my favorite rig got real dirty.
[03:33.940 --> 03:37.020]  So I switched over to an even smaller rig. I'm hitting the hitman phase two.
[03:37.020 --> 03:39.580]  It's a little tiny rig. The phase two with the thermal banger.
[03:40.100 --> 03:41.700]  I really like the small rigs. You guys,
[03:41.900 --> 03:45.020]  I see a lot of people smoking out of big gigantic dab rigs. Why?
[03:45.060 --> 03:48.060]  There's no need for that. A bong. When you're smoking a bong,
[03:48.060 --> 03:49.860]  you're trying to fill all that glass space, that,
[03:49.900 --> 03:52.380]  that whole chamber with smoke so that when you pull it,
[03:52.620 --> 03:54.500]  you get this big old blast of smoke. Whoa.
[03:54.500 --> 03:56.820]  And then you choke and your eyes turn red. It's fucking awesome, right?
[03:56.820 --> 03:58.780]  You got a big old bong rip. When you're taking a dab,
[03:59.100 --> 04:01.700]  I don't want to smoke a liter of oxygen before my dad gets to me.
[04:01.940 --> 04:04.980]  I want to heat the nail. I want to let it get still towards a little bit too hot
[04:04.980 --> 04:06.700]  for most people. I like my dad's hot. You guys, I'm sorry.
[04:06.700 --> 04:08.220]  That's how I like it. That's how I do it. People talk shit,
[04:08.220 --> 04:10.500]  but I'm a hot dab smoker. I like to get towards,
[04:10.500 --> 04:11.380]  just still a little bit too hot.
[04:11.380 --> 04:12.860]  Then I put my dad in there and then I cap it.
[04:13.500 --> 04:17.140]  And then that dad goes from the nail through the water, poof into my head.
[04:17.180 --> 04:19.540]  Pow. That's just like a punch to the face.
[04:20.020 --> 04:21.660]  I feel like there's no need for all the air.
[04:21.700 --> 04:24.500]  I just need some bubbles to percolate and cool down the wild,
[04:24.500 --> 04:28.020]  cool down the smoke a little bit before it gets to my throat because it'll burn
[04:28.060 --> 04:28.980]  my throat if you don't cool it down.
[04:28.980 --> 04:31.460]  I don't like to smoke dabs out of something without water.
[04:31.500 --> 04:33.740]  I need some water filtration, some bubbles. Uh,
[04:33.740 --> 04:36.820]  but I like straight from the nail through the water, through the mouthpiece,
[04:37.500 --> 04:39.740]  punch me in the head. That's where I want my dad. Uh,
[04:39.740 --> 04:43.100]  so you guys are smoking out of big rigs, downsize, see what it does to you.
[04:43.260 --> 04:47.180]  Get a little tiny rig and see how much better it works for you. All right,
[04:47.180 --> 04:49.220]  you guys, I've been giving you breeding updates.
[04:49.300 --> 04:54.180]  I've got a small breeding project going on. I have got a star dog, female,
[04:54.260 --> 04:56.940]  a Durban poison, female, and a platinum Tangy female,
[04:56.940 --> 04:57.900]  plus a couple others in there.
[04:57.900 --> 05:00.100]  But those are the three we're going to talk about right now, uh,
[05:00.140 --> 05:03.620]  that have been pollinated by King Solomon, which is an arise male.
[05:03.860 --> 05:08.580]  Arise is the golden goat female cross to a daybreaker male that made a rise.
[05:08.780 --> 05:11.340]  The females that arise have tested as high as, uh,
[05:11.340 --> 05:16.540]  there's been 35% consistent tests. There's been 32% consistent tests. Uh,
[05:16.540 --> 05:21.060]  so that's 32% THC, 35% THC coming from the arise females.
[05:21.380 --> 05:23.220]  I found a male that performs well.
[05:23.220 --> 05:26.020]  I really love the shape and structure and the aroma that comes from that male.
[05:26.180 --> 05:29.820]  It flowers in a great amount of time. I, it makes trichomes. I,
[05:29.820 --> 05:32.300]  I'd really like this male plant. It makes great progeny.
[05:32.660 --> 05:36.140]  So I have pollinated the star dog, the Durban poison,
[05:36.220 --> 05:39.740]  the platinum Tangy and a couple other select females with this arise.
[05:40.460 --> 05:43.260]  Today is day 45 of flowering for those plants.
[05:43.260 --> 05:48.260]  They got pollinated about 25 days into flower, so they will be ready. Uh,
[05:48.380 --> 05:51.620]  and let's say it's got 45 days. We got about 15, maybe 20,
[05:51.620 --> 05:55.100]  25 days until those seeds are ready. We'll chop down the plants. Well,
[05:55.100 --> 05:56.500]  first we'll cut off all the big leaves,
[05:56.620 --> 05:58.460]  chop down the plants that I'm hanging upside down and dry.
[05:58.460 --> 05:59.820]  And then we'll cut them into smaller pieces.
[06:00.180 --> 06:02.620]  Then I'll crunch them up into a little Tupperware dish and get all the seeds
[06:02.620 --> 06:06.340]  out. And then I'll grow a bunch of those and see what I have created. Honestly,
[06:06.340 --> 06:11.180]  I'm pretty excited. A star dog is a great commercial strain. It's a great yielder.
[06:11.620 --> 06:14.300]  It makes a nice rock hard, dense buds. It smells real good.
[06:14.380 --> 06:17.740]  It takes amazing photos. I love the smoke and the flavor.
[06:17.940 --> 06:20.780]  It's got a nice head high to it. It does what I want for medicine.
[06:21.540 --> 06:25.300]  So I think crossing it to the arise, which also smells good, tastes good.
[06:25.460 --> 06:27.340]  It does this eye thing. When I smoke it arise,
[06:27.340 --> 06:29.620]  makes my eyes feel real heavy and I miss that in weed.
[06:29.620 --> 06:32.260]  A lot of the new weed doesn't have the eye high that the old weed had.
[06:32.740 --> 06:36.220]  And it's got that. So I like that. I think by crossing the two,
[06:36.540 --> 06:40.900]  I should really make some, I'm hoping to improve the harvests of the star dog.
[06:40.940 --> 06:44.260]  I'm hoping to put that, uh, that arise vigor into the star dog.
[06:44.260 --> 06:47.660]  I'm hoping to get that cushy smell. I'm hoping to get a lot of trichomes.
[06:47.660 --> 06:50.980]  I'm hoping to get a lot of THC. I look forward to that one. A lot.
[06:50.980 --> 06:52.940]  Durban poison was the other one that I was excited about.
[06:52.940 --> 06:54.740]  I'm just dabbing the Durban poison live resin.
[06:55.140 --> 06:58.660]  I love the flavor of Durban poison. You guys, the flavor is amazing,
[06:58.660 --> 07:01.900]  but also the high from Durban poison, that sativa head thing that it does.
[07:02.180 --> 07:04.660]  A lot of people, if you would have smoked as much Durban poison,
[07:04.660 --> 07:07.780]  hashes I just smoked the live resin. I just call all concentrates hash.
[07:07.940 --> 07:10.820]  If you would have smoked as much Durban poison, live resin, as I just smoked,
[07:11.100 --> 07:14.340]  the most people would be kind of in like a panicky state or like a weird trippy
[07:14.340 --> 07:16.180]  state, but it makes me just right. I really love it.
[07:16.180 --> 07:17.060]  It makes me a little talkative,
[07:17.300 --> 07:19.580]  but I'm drinking a Dr. Pepper and having some sativa dabs.
[07:19.580 --> 07:23.780]  I'm trying to be talkative, but I just love the Durban poison, the Durban poison.
[07:24.100 --> 07:27.220]  Uh, it grow, it's a little lanky in the grow. It could be better.
[07:27.540 --> 07:29.940]  So I'm hoping to improve the structure,
[07:29.940 --> 07:34.940]  improve the harvest and take that flavor into something that I can pass along and
[07:34.940 --> 07:37.460]  maybe find a cushier Durban poison sort of a flavor.
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.380]  I just want to see what I could do with it. Um,
[07:39.620 --> 07:42.060]  I'm going to grow a bunch of those and then we'll see where that goes from
[07:42.060 --> 07:44.620]  there. Of course, the platinum tangy, that's going to make just oranges.
[07:44.700 --> 07:47.140]  I'm hoping that everything just tastes like oranges and it's covered in
[07:47.140 --> 07:51.100]  trichomes. Uh, Spence and Maddie from the garden of Weeden bred the platinum
[07:51.100 --> 07:54.140]  tangy that I've got and they nailed it. Uh, it's a perfect plant.
[07:54.340 --> 07:57.420]  It tastes amazing. It grows very well, uh, but it's small.
[07:57.420 --> 07:59.780]  It stays short and squat and it doesn't yield enough.
[07:59.940 --> 08:01.700]  So by putting the bigger rise male to it,
[08:01.720 --> 08:05.300]  I'm hoping to just increase the size of that plant is my main goal.
[08:05.500 --> 08:06.900]  I want to bring the orange flavor.
[08:07.140 --> 08:09.420]  I want to increase the resin and I want to make the plant bigger.
[08:09.580 --> 08:11.860]  It's my main goal there. I'm super excited about those.
[08:12.060 --> 08:14.140]  So this is the part where I make it interactive.
[08:14.180 --> 08:19.180]  If you have got name suggestions for star dog to arise,
[08:19.660 --> 08:21.900]  I would like to hear name suggestions for that strain.
[08:22.100 --> 08:26.380]  If you have got name suggestions for Durban poison to arise,
[08:26.500 --> 08:29.940]  I would like to hear your suggestions for that, for those strains. Keep in mind.
[08:29.940 --> 08:33.060]  I like grateful dead type stuff. I like reggae theme type stuff,
[08:33.260 --> 08:36.860]  but anything you've got, I may use it. Let's see what you've got for me.
[08:37.180 --> 08:40.860]  Throw some stuff at me. You can tweet me at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[08:41.060 --> 08:43.940]  You can find me on Facebook. Simply search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[08:44.460 --> 08:45.580]  You can go to my Instagram,
[08:45.580 --> 08:48.940]  I re underscore genetics or you can always send me an email.
[08:49.020 --> 08:51.860]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[08:52.420 --> 08:56.420]  I look forward to hearing your creative name suggestions. A star Wars shit,
[08:56.500 --> 09:00.460]  stuff like that always works. Video game stuff is cool stuff from my childhood.
[09:00.460 --> 09:03.580]  Of course I'm a GI Joe fan because I've got a strain named storm shadow.
[09:03.980 --> 09:05.940]  Let me know what you think. I've got a couple of ideas,
[09:06.300 --> 09:08.740]  but I like getting input from my friends.
[09:09.220 --> 09:12.540]  So that's a little breeding update. You guys, let's move the podcast forward.
[09:12.540 --> 09:15.620]  You know what? I've got an iTunes comment that I want to read. Oh,
[09:15.620 --> 09:16.980]  and before I read the iTunes comments,
[09:16.980 --> 09:20.420]  I should let you guys know that they have changed the way that you can leave
[09:20.420 --> 09:23.380]  comments and reviews or ratings and reviews on iTunes.
[09:23.860 --> 09:25.780]  Instead of having to go all the way to the iTunes store,
[09:25.940 --> 09:27.780]  if you're using an iPhone or an iDevice,
[09:28.260 --> 09:30.140]  go to the podcast that you'd like to review.

[09:58.100 --> 10:01.020]  There's a section there where you can leave a rating and a review.
[10:01.020 --> 10:03.660]  It says right of review right here on the bottom of that part.
[10:04.020 --> 10:05.620]  I'm going to click on there and see what happens.
[10:05.620 --> 10:08.660]  I'm not going to leave myself a review. You guys that's cheesy and hokey,
[10:08.940 --> 10:12.500]  but there it is. Uh, there's an option to give yourself how many stars,
[10:12.500 --> 10:16.820]  or for you to give me how many stars you feel I deserve a title of your review
[10:16.980 --> 10:20.780]  and a review. So I encourage you, I would appreciate it. If you go to iTunes,

[10:24.500 --> 10:26.460]  click on the amount of stars that you feel I deserve.
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.660]  So far most people have left me five stars.
[10:28.660 --> 10:31.300]  One person left me a four star review. That's fair.
[10:31.460 --> 10:34.340]  If you feel like I deserve less than five, click on it. Be honest.
[10:34.340 --> 10:35.220]  I want to know what you think,
[10:35.700 --> 10:37.740]  but after you click on the amount of stars you feel I deserve,

[10:40.820 --> 10:43.940]  If you love it, if you hate it, type it right in there and let me know.
[10:44.020 --> 10:46.860]  And I will read your review on a future episode.
[10:46.860 --> 10:48.100]  And that's what I'm going to do right now.
[10:48.260 --> 10:50.340]  I'm going to read the most recent review.
[10:50.620 --> 10:54.860]  This one came from a person who their iTunes handle is Lunchbox3,
[10:54.860 --> 10:58.500]  which I like really well, but they say I go by ChronicCoby.
[10:59.420 --> 11:02.700]  They were kind enough to give me a five star review and it goes like this.
[11:02.700 --> 11:06.060]  I recently started growing this year and was recommended to this podcast by a
[11:06.900 --> 11:07.740]  friend. Well, thanks to your friend.
[11:08.100 --> 11:11.060]  The first podcast I ever listened to was your show and what a great decision
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.660]  that was. Well, welcome to podcasting.
[11:12.660 --> 11:16.020]  I hope we opened the floodgates of podcasting. Once you get into podcasts,
[11:16.020 --> 11:17.580]  you're going to start listening to a lot of great shit.
[11:17.580 --> 11:19.060]  So welcome to the world of podcasting.
[11:19.580 --> 11:23.220]  Your show incorporates just about every aspect about cannabis from state laws to
[11:23.220 --> 11:23.980]  tips on growing.
[11:23.980 --> 11:28.060]  I've done a fair amount of research to familiarize myself with the
[11:28.060 --> 11:31.820]  basics and being able to hear you touch on them again in such a thorough manner
[11:31.820 --> 11:35.260]  was extremely helpful. Hey, man, that means a lot to me.
[11:35.260 --> 11:39.900]  I'm glad that my podcast is paralleling your
[11:39.900 --> 11:42.900]  research and that we are matching up and I'm kind of reaffirming the things that
[11:42.900 --> 11:45.220]  you read. So it's always nice to have some affirmation.
[11:45.420 --> 11:48.500]  So I'm glad I could do that for you. Let me see where I was. Also,
[11:48.500 --> 11:52.340]  I really enjoy how you keep the mood, a good balance between serious and funny.
[11:52.660 --> 11:54.580]  Yes, we got to be funny. I love comedy.
[11:54.860 --> 11:56.700]  I hang out with a bunch of smart ass people.
[11:57.180 --> 12:00.300]  I was raised by a long line of professional smart asses.
[12:00.340 --> 12:02.620]  So I do like to be kind of funny sometimes.
[12:02.660 --> 12:05.100]  Sometimes it just comes on accidentally and naturally in the show.
[12:05.100 --> 12:08.980]  So I'm glad you appreciate that. I feel like keeping it fun helps people learn.
[12:09.020 --> 12:12.140]  I always had more fun in school when I was laughing and my teacher was actually
[12:12.140 --> 12:15.540]  being cool and not being a dick and just forcing useless information down my
[12:15.540 --> 12:19.140]  throat. So thanks for enjoying the balance between serious and funny.
[12:19.140 --> 12:20.140]  And thanks for finding me funny.
[12:20.420 --> 12:23.100]  I'm sure some people don't find my shenanigans and my bullshit funny.
[12:23.100 --> 12:26.100]  So I'm glad that you do. The message or the review goes on to say,
[12:26.100 --> 12:30.100]  thanks for all the knowledge and time you've put into the show. Keep on keeping on.
[12:30.100 --> 12:32.620]  Hey, you're welcome. Thanks for noticing. I'm glad you appreciate it.
[12:32.900 --> 12:34.940]  And once again, welcome to the world of podcasting.
[12:34.940 --> 12:36.980]  I hope you were listening to a lot of podcasts.
[12:37.260 --> 12:38.860]  I'm going to give a couple of friends a shout out.
[12:39.060 --> 12:42.420]  If you are new to podcasting and you're looking for more cannabis podcasts,
[12:42.420 --> 12:44.500]  I would say, listen to the Dude Grows Show.
[12:44.740 --> 12:46.660]  That's a great cannabis related podcast.
[12:46.940 --> 12:50.900]  And if you want a podcast that is not cannabis related, uh, check out,
[12:50.900 --> 12:54.940]  of course the Joe Rogan Experience. Here's something kind of random.
[12:55.100 --> 12:56.860]  Lately I've fallen in love with the podcast.
[12:56.860 --> 12:58.580]  They haven't put out a new episode in quite a while,
[12:58.580 --> 13:02.420]  but the old episodes are wonderful. It's called Under the Scales with Tom Marshall.
[13:02.460 --> 13:04.460]  Yes, I am a big, silly fish fan.
[13:04.740 --> 13:08.940]  I am in love with the band Fish. I've seen Fish a lot of times. I love Fish.
[13:08.980 --> 13:12.860]  The music of Fish, the sound of Trey's guitar, the sound of Paige's keyboards,
[13:13.140 --> 13:16.180]  the way Fishman plays the drums, the way Mike thumps the bass.
[13:16.180 --> 13:18.220]  It's all just fucking magical. The way it all happens to me.
[13:18.220 --> 13:20.220]  That is my favorite band. They're,
[13:20.460 --> 13:23.860]  the guy that writes a lot of their lyrics is not in the band,
[13:23.860 --> 13:26.220]  but he is closely connected with the band.
[13:26.220 --> 13:30.780]  He has made a podcast about the band and I am a few episodes in,
[13:30.780 --> 13:32.820]  and I am addicted to this podcast.
[13:32.820 --> 13:36.340]  I think there are 35 episodes total. I think I'm 12 episodes in now.
[13:37.180 --> 13:40.660]  I won't listen to another podcast until I finish every episode of this one.
[13:40.660 --> 13:43.660]  I feel I may have to take a break just to not hear Tom's voice for a minute,
[13:43.660 --> 13:45.540]  but I'm addicted. I love it.
[13:45.540 --> 13:47.700]  So if you guys are into Fish and you want a podcast,
[13:47.700 --> 13:49.020]  you want to know a lot about Fish.
[13:49.580 --> 13:53.060]  There are two episodes back to back where they interview Trey about his guitars.
[13:53.860 --> 13:57.300]  Hearing Trey talk about his relationship with Paul,
[13:57.540 --> 14:01.580]  the guy that built his guitars and how Paul became a guitar builder and how it
[14:01.580 --> 14:05.460]  all just unfolded. I really made open my eyes to even more of Fish.
[14:05.460 --> 14:09.700]  I've been following Fish since 1995 and I learned a lot through this podcast.
[14:09.700 --> 14:12.620]  So check it out. If you're a Fish kid, if you're a Fish fan,
[14:12.660 --> 14:15.740]  I think you'll enjoy it. There's a lot of rambles about a podcast,
[14:15.740 --> 14:18.500]  but I recommend it. All right. I want to give a huge shout out to my friend,
[14:18.660 --> 14:20.940]  Chronic Kobe, also known as Lunchbox3.
[14:21.140 --> 14:25.020]  Thanks for the great review and the five star rating. I appreciate it.
[14:25.140 --> 14:27.900]  Also big thanks to everybody who's left a rating and a review in the past.
[14:28.060 --> 14:31.340]  That really helps me out on iTunes. I encourage everyone else to go,
[14:31.340 --> 14:35.060]  leave me a rating and a review that gets the show seen by more people.
[14:35.500 --> 14:38.580]  The more people that see the show in the iTunes feed,
[14:38.580 --> 14:41.180]  the more people can listen to the show. The more people listen to the show,
[14:41.180 --> 14:44.420]  that means the more people will grow better cannabis.
[14:44.420 --> 14:47.860]  More people will help to legalize cannabis. Just spread the word,
[14:48.100 --> 14:52.300]  spread the love, grow from your heart podcast. All right, podcast world.
[14:52.460 --> 14:55.900]  A few episodes back, I talked about Sweetleaf dispensary.
[14:55.900 --> 14:59.460]  Sweetleaf was the chain of dispensaries that was raided and a few of the
[14:59.500 --> 15:02.340]  bud tenders were arrested. Actually 13 people were arrested.
[15:02.860 --> 15:05.700]  10 of them have actually been charged. I've got an update for you.
[15:06.460 --> 15:09.700]  I actually found an article on the cannabis that tells me everything I wanted
[15:09.700 --> 15:12.100]  to know. So I'm just going to read the article from the cannabis.
[15:12.140 --> 15:14.940]  This was written by Alicia Wallace on the cannabis staff.
[15:15.260 --> 15:17.180]  The headline says inside informants,
[15:17.220 --> 15:21.060]  loopers and the undercover investigation that led to Sweetleaf raids.
[15:21.100 --> 15:25.380]  The sub headline is the Denver police department search warrant reveals details
[15:25.420 --> 15:29.500]  of the long and the year long investigation. The article goes like this,
[15:29.820 --> 15:34.060]  a bud tenders six months stint at the Sweetleaf marijuana center in Aurora came
[15:34.060 --> 15:35.540]  with no incident, no incidents,
[15:35.580 --> 15:38.300]  no activity recognizable as illegal or suspicious.
[15:38.620 --> 15:41.620]  The same couldn't be said after that employee was transferred to the Sweetleaf
[15:41.620 --> 15:44.540]  location off 38th Avenue and clay street in Denver.
[15:44.540 --> 15:48.580]  According to a Denver police department affidavit obtained by the cannabis,
[15:48.860 --> 15:50.060]  things are a little different here.
[15:50.060 --> 15:54.740]  An assistant manager allegedly told the employee during his first work shift at
[15:54.740 --> 15:59.100]  2647 West 38th Avenue. You'll get used to the loopers.
[15:59.340 --> 16:02.540]  So with the old location where this employee allegedly worked, uh,
[16:02.700 --> 16:05.900]  they didn't allow looping, but when they moved them to this location,
[16:05.980 --> 16:09.980]  allegedly one of the employees told them you'll get used to the loopers.
[16:09.980 --> 16:13.500]  Now let me tell you what loopers are really quickly in a dispensary in Colorado,
[16:13.500 --> 16:14.740]  a recreational dispensary,
[16:15.140 --> 16:18.900]  a customer is allowed to purchase seven grams of cannabis per transaction.
[16:19.780 --> 16:23.780]  Now that there has been a loophole found where per transaction means you can walk
[16:23.820 --> 16:25.860]  out the door, drive your car around the building,
[16:26.060 --> 16:29.580]  go back in the door and make another transaction and you can buy seven more
[16:29.580 --> 16:33.460]  grams. Now there was a memo sent out by the marijuana enforcement division
[16:33.460 --> 16:36.580]  saying, Hey, dispensaries, that's bullshit. Stop doing that.
[16:37.020 --> 16:40.180]  Now they kept doing it. Now that's looping. That is looping.
[16:40.180 --> 16:41.860]  And it was made clear that it can't be done.
[16:42.140 --> 16:45.820]  Looping is when you just return or a lot of people like to go to different
[16:45.820 --> 16:48.460]  dispensaries, which is, that's cool because that doesn't look like shit.
[16:48.460 --> 16:50.860]  You're not just going back. It go to a different dispensary.
[16:50.860 --> 16:51.940]  It makes you not look so shitty,
[16:51.940 --> 16:53.860]  but they're going to implement a tracking system.
[16:54.060 --> 16:55.580]  I bet because of stuff like this.
[16:55.780 --> 16:59.020]  Let me continue with the article and stop assuming things. The article says,
[16:59.020 --> 16:59.660]  the affidavit,
[16:59.660 --> 17:03.060]  one of several filed as a request for search warrants in the case provides some
[17:03.060 --> 17:07.060]  glimpses into the year long investigation of alleged illegal marijuana sales at
[17:07.060 --> 17:11.260]  the Denver based sweet leaf chain. The investigation, which is ongoing,
[17:11.340 --> 17:14.780]  zeroed in on alleged incidents of looping in which individuals would make
[17:14.780 --> 17:18.100]  repeated purchases of one ounce of recreational marijuana. Oh,
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.220]  I said seven grams, not an ounce. I'm sorry.
[17:20.740 --> 17:23.660]  The maximum allowed for purchase and possession per Colorado law,
[17:23.860 --> 17:28.060]  several times a day. So they would go back several times and buy several ounces.
[17:28.820 --> 17:30.540]  Now I did fuck up and say seven grams,
[17:30.540 --> 17:33.460]  but when we originally started recreational cannabis in Colorado,
[17:33.460 --> 17:36.340]  seven grams was the limit that out of state folks were allowed to buy.
[17:36.660 --> 17:39.740]  And they quickly increased that once they realized people were just shopping
[17:39.740 --> 17:41.980]  around and going place to place. They were trying to slow that down.
[17:42.500 --> 17:44.420]  But now they sell them an ounce and an ounce.
[17:45.140 --> 17:48.100]  If you were from out of state and you're visiting here and ounces,
[17:48.100 --> 17:50.500]  there's plenty of weed for you to have on you and just be smoking.
[17:50.500 --> 17:52.140]  If you're smoking more than an ounce a day,
[17:52.220 --> 17:54.420]  you got to have a lot of people with you. You got to be a heavy,
[17:54.420 --> 17:57.420]  heavy smoker, or it looks suspicious and you're doing something.
[17:57.660 --> 18:01.100]  If you're buying four, five, eight ounces at a time, something's happening.
[18:01.580 --> 18:03.900]  So let me continue with the last paragraph of this article here.
[18:03.900 --> 18:06.260]  And we'll wrap up this update. It says on December 14th,
[18:06.260 --> 18:09.220]  police raided several Denver area sweet leaf locations,
[18:09.220 --> 18:13.900]  executing search warrants and arresting 13 bud tenders employees involved in the
[18:13.900 --> 18:16.820]  sale of marijuana. Then here's the final part. As of Thursday,
[18:16.820 --> 18:20.980]  10 employees have been charged with either misdemeanor or felony distribution
[18:21.220 --> 18:25.460]  of marijuana. So 13 were arrested. Only 10 have been charged.
[18:26.020 --> 18:28.860]  There is another article attached to this and it says attorney for sweet leaf
[18:28.860 --> 18:33.180]  bud tenders files to dismiss felony charges. The article is fairly long,
[18:33.180 --> 18:34.900]  but there is a part in here that I wanted to share.
[18:35.380 --> 18:39.500]  It says that the sweet leaf employees, and it lists a bunch of names who were,
[18:39.500 --> 18:41.620]  each charged with felony distribution of marijuana,
[18:41.620 --> 18:45.740]  more than four ounces acted within the bounds of state law.
[18:45.780 --> 18:49.780]  Their attorney, Robert J. Corey wrote in a court motion filed Thursday to dismiss
[18:49.980 --> 18:53.540]  the charges. The article also states that amendment 64,
[18:53.540 --> 18:56.260]  the 2012 voter approved approved ballot measure,
[18:56.260 --> 19:00.700]  legalizing adult use marijuana sales establishes threshold immunity from
[19:00.700 --> 19:04.900]  criminal protection. Robert Corey claimed the Colorado constitution allows for
[19:04.900 --> 19:09.500]  adults to possess one ounce or fewer of marijuana in additions to actions such
[19:09.500 --> 19:12.540]  as transferring of one ounce or under to another adult,
[19:12.540 --> 19:16.780]  as well as assisting another adult. Corey wrote those and other personal rights
[19:16.780 --> 19:21.340]  included in legalization amendment 64 specifically immunize immunizes
[19:21.340 --> 19:25.780]  actions taken by marijuana establishments. Corey added.
[19:26.260 --> 19:28.100]  So it looks like they've got a good lawyer. Uh,
[19:28.140 --> 19:29.900]  they're trying to get the charges dismissed.
[19:30.420 --> 19:33.580]  A lot of people think that this was just kind of a wake up call by the MED
[19:33.580 --> 19:35.540]  saying, Hey, we see people doing things.
[19:35.580 --> 19:38.300]  This is our way to let people know that we're going to step in and do some shit
[19:38.300 --> 19:40.860]  about it. So, uh, I will keep my eye on this.
[19:40.860 --> 19:44.260]  I will try to keep you guys updated on how things unfold. Once again,
[19:44.260 --> 19:47.020]  I owe a huge shout out to our friends over at the cannabis. Uh,
[19:47.020 --> 19:51.780]  if you want to read more, there are several links at the cannabis.co.
[19:52.540 --> 19:54.740]  All right. Podcast world. I've been going for like 20 minutes and my throat's
[19:54.740 --> 19:57.700]  getting super dry. My eyes are getting bright and white and lifting up.
[19:57.900 --> 20:00.300]  It's time for me to press pause, take a couple of dabs,
[20:00.500 --> 20:02.900]  put some caffeine in my head, put a little water on my throat,
[20:03.020 --> 20:03.980]  and then I'll be right back.
[20:04.140 --> 20:08.100]  And we're going to talk about ARI buds and a question that I got from my
[20:08.100 --> 20:12.580]  Instagram live feed about do ARI buds contain more THC.
[20:12.780 --> 20:15.820]  And I started talking about ARI fluffy buds and a lot of people on my Instagram
[20:15.820 --> 20:19.220]  live feed right away were like, yeah, fuck fluffy buds. But guess what?
[20:19.900 --> 20:22.540]  Your opinion may change when I talk about it after this dab,
[20:22.540 --> 20:25.700]  you guys get your nail hot and get a fat dab out, take a dab with me.
[20:25.860 --> 20:35.000]  And I'll be right back. All right. Podcast world. I am back.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.960]  I just took maybe too big of a dab of some lucky charms,
[20:37.960 --> 20:42.160]  high cannabinoid full spectrum extract, uh, from our friends at apothecary.
[20:42.560 --> 20:45.440]  I got super lit from that. I feel a coughing fit coming on here,
[20:45.440 --> 20:48.560]  just a couple of minutes. So I apologize when that does begin. Uh,
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.680]  before I took a break and got way too high, uh,
[20:50.680 --> 20:53.600]  I teased that I was going to talk about ARI buds.
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.120]  I was on Instagram live a few days ago and somebody asked me if ARI buds
[20:58.360 --> 21:02.240]  contain more THC. I wrote a little piece about that.
[21:02.520 --> 21:05.080]  And then I was on Instagram live again today. And somebody said,
[21:05.080 --> 21:08.240]  what's the podcast going to be about? And I said, it's going to be ARI buds.
[21:08.600 --> 21:11.400]  And a couple of my friends instantly said, fuck ARI buds.
[21:11.880 --> 21:14.840]  Uh, everyone's allowed to their own opinion. So I asked politely,
[21:14.880 --> 21:19.640]  why fuck ARI buds? The answers I got were they're terrible to trim. Yes.
[21:19.720 --> 21:22.760]  ARI buds do suck the trim. That is very true. Uh,
[21:22.800 --> 21:26.840]  the other answer was zero bag appeal, which is kind of true.
[21:27.080 --> 21:29.360]  Other than it makes your bud, your bag look huge,
[21:29.360 --> 21:30.920]  but everybody wants those little rocks.
[21:31.160 --> 21:33.720]  Everybody wants those cushy tight, compacted buds.
[21:33.720 --> 21:37.160]  Everybody wants not ARI buds. They want dense buds. Uh,
[21:37.160 --> 21:39.160]  they want a nice fat looking bag of weed.
[21:39.160 --> 21:42.680]  They want some green and some purple, maybe some orange in there. Uh, that's,
[21:42.680 --> 21:45.880]  that's what people are looking for. Not fluffy, crappy, shitty,
[21:45.880 --> 21:49.600]  trimmed looking weed. So somebody, the first question that started this was, uh,
[21:49.640 --> 21:53.360]  do ARI buds have more THC? Uh,
[21:53.960 --> 21:56.560]  maybe that depends on the genetics that depends on your strain.
[21:56.560 --> 21:57.440]  That depends on the grower.
[21:57.720 --> 22:02.640]  I don't think more THC because it's ARI is a thing. What is possible,
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.000]  however, is there is more surface area of an ARI bud.
[22:06.280 --> 22:11.000]  So that may allow for more room for more trichomes because that is where the
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.080]  oils, the THC are contained. So there are more,
[22:15.320 --> 22:18.200]  put your hand in a fist, hold your hand in a fist in front of you. Now,
[22:18.400 --> 22:21.560]  imagine if I were to coat your fist in trichomes,
[22:21.880 --> 22:25.080]  you've got a fist covered in trichomes, right? You can, you can visualize that.
[22:25.080 --> 22:27.880]  Your hand is covered in trichomes. Now open your hand.
[22:28.440 --> 22:31.920]  Now look at all the space that would have been missed by those trichomes.
[22:31.920 --> 22:34.920]  If we had just coated your hand in trichomes, all you had a fist. Now,
[22:35.040 --> 22:37.480]  if you've got an ARI bud that is open like your hand,
[22:37.600 --> 22:40.200]  you've got that much more surface area to put trichomes.
[22:40.520 --> 22:43.080]  Another way you could think about it, make a fist, uh,
[22:43.360 --> 22:45.400]  spray your hand with a spray bottle. So your hands all wet,
[22:45.600 --> 22:48.560]  stick your hand in some flour or some powdered sugar, pull your hand out.
[22:49.280 --> 22:51.680]  Now you see where all the trichomes would have gone. Open your hand.
[22:51.920 --> 22:53.840]  Now you see where all the trichomes did not go.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.280]  Spray your hand down with more water,
[22:55.440 --> 22:57.600]  stick that bitch back in the flour or the powdered sugar.
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.840]  See how many more trichomes you just gathered.
[23:00.200 --> 23:04.200]  So the ARI buds do not have more THC per se.
[23:04.360 --> 23:07.920]  They have more surface area. So I guess if you lab tested a gram of those,
[23:08.560 --> 23:13.560]  if you tested a gram of high five buds against a gram of fist punch buds,
[23:14.280 --> 23:18.800]  I guess maybe the high five open handed buds would probably contain more THC per
[23:18.800 --> 23:23.360]  gram because there is more surface area. So that may be a thing.
[23:23.840 --> 23:27.520]  Now we need to find out are the buds getting fluffy and foxtailed because of
[23:27.520 --> 23:29.240]  genetics or because of heat.
[23:29.840 --> 23:34.120]  And that may help us decide if we've got good genetics that we want to use that
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.240]  foxtail. Now you're going to say, why would I even want it if it foxtails?
[23:37.720 --> 23:42.520]  Because if it makes a lot of big foxtails and it produces huge amounts of
[23:42.520 --> 23:47.080]  resin and huge amounts of THC, grow it and make concentrates out of it.
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.200]  The market in Colorado Springs is about 70% concentrates,
[23:52.360 --> 23:56.960]  30% flour in Pueblo. It's about 50% in Denver. I do not know,
[23:56.980 --> 24:00.040]  but I would assume it's right up there with Colorado Springs and the 70%
[24:00.040 --> 24:02.160]  concentrate, 30% flour range.
[24:02.480 --> 24:04.320]  I'm sure edibles take up some of that business,
[24:04.320 --> 24:06.920]  but for what I'm watching and the conversation that I had,
[24:07.200 --> 24:10.240]  people sell a lot more concentrates than they do flowers.
[24:10.560 --> 24:13.360]  And I see that becoming the trend. People are,
[24:14.360 --> 24:17.120]  people are in a hurry nowadays. They don't have time to roll a joint,
[24:17.280 --> 24:21.320]  smoke an entire joint and then fucking smoke another one to get as high as you
[24:21.320 --> 24:23.760]  want to be. When you could grab a dabber, heat the nail,
[24:23.880 --> 24:28.360]  take a fat dab and be on your way. Also, people are much more health conscious.
[24:28.360 --> 24:31.720]  They don't want to consume as much flour. And also dabbing is just,
[24:31.760 --> 24:34.600]  I like dabbing. Don't get me wrong. I like to smoke flowers,
[24:34.800 --> 24:38.240]  but the trend is getting to where concentrates are more popular.
[24:38.440 --> 24:40.040]  Concentrates sell more.
[24:40.880 --> 24:44.320]  So if you're growing specifically to make concentrates,
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.400]  why wouldn't you want airy buds that have more surface area to contain more THC?
[24:50.840 --> 24:52.160]  I don't see that to be a problem.
[24:52.240 --> 24:54.040]  If you're just going to turn it into concentrates,
[24:54.040 --> 24:56.880]  you just have to take off those big leaves. If you've got big fan leaves,
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.600]  go clip those off. You can start taking those off a week before harvest.
[25:00.640 --> 25:02.000]  Just go in there and start cleaning up the room.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.560]  Whenever you're in there watering, pick one plant, just strip that bitch naked.
[25:05.680 --> 25:08.880]  Keep going every day until harvest. However many plants you got. I know,
[25:08.880 --> 25:11.720]  you may have a lot of plants I know, but just start cleaning up before harvest.
[25:12.480 --> 25:15.320]  So you can just pull off all those leaves and then a harvest time you got these
[25:15.320 --> 25:17.000]  airy buds that are covered in trichomes.
[25:17.320 --> 25:21.840]  So find out if it's foxtailing and getting airy because of environmental
[25:21.840 --> 25:25.440]  problems. Is it too hot? Is it stressing out? Is it too dry in there?
[25:25.640 --> 25:29.800]  Does it have a problem? If you have a problem, you've got to figure that out.
[25:29.800 --> 25:33.320]  Maybe you've got a problem and you're still getting mad THC. If it ain't broke,
[25:33.360 --> 25:34.200]  don't fix it.
[25:34.440 --> 25:39.000]  But if it's genetics that's making it foxtail and it's you've got the room
[25:39.020 --> 25:43.040]  dialed in and it makes foxtails and it's making a lot of THC,
[25:43.240 --> 25:45.200]  that may be a hash plant that is worth keeping.
[25:45.920 --> 25:50.640]  And I do predict that that is the way that you're going to see cannabis turning
[25:50.640 --> 25:53.520]  for a lot of commercial grows in the future. You're going to see more fluffy stuff.
[25:54.120 --> 25:56.360]  The bag appeal right now is all about, like I said earlier,
[25:56.360 --> 25:59.280]  it's about little acorns. Everyone wants rocks, acorns,
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.640]  tight little buds that are covered in resin, very well trimmed. Uh,
[26:02.720 --> 26:06.400]  you want to see orange on there. You want to see bright green in there.
[26:06.520 --> 26:08.760]  You want to see purple in there. Depending on what you're into.
[26:08.920 --> 26:11.040]  The purple and orange combination looks really sharp to me.
[26:11.060 --> 26:12.800]  I think that really has a lot of bag appeal.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.760]  That's usually not the weed I want to smoke. I want the bright green stuff.
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.800]  Most of the time. I don't know, but it's been all about the bag appeal.
[26:20.040 --> 26:22.000]  Since you're not going for bag appeal, if you're making concentrates,
[26:22.020 --> 26:25.720]  you can grow airy fluffy buds if it's based on the genetics and not based on a
[26:25.720 --> 26:26.440]  problem.
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.800]  And if those fluffy airy buds are producing enough resin to make it worth your
[26:30.800 --> 26:33.840]  time and energy. So if you've got a strain that's growing fluffy,
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.200]  perhaps a haze or some sort of a tropical sativa that takes a long time and it's
[26:38.200 --> 26:42.040]  growing real fluffy buds when you're finished with it, make hash out of it,
[26:42.240 --> 26:43.360]  make BHO out of it,
[26:43.400 --> 26:46.720]  make live resin out of it and see what percentage of a return you get.
[26:46.960 --> 26:50.440]  See if it's higher than your standard return that you get on your BHO or your
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.260]  live resin.
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.240]  Just see if you get more out of it and it may be worth your time and energy just
[26:55.240 --> 26:56.280]  because it's Fox Tailey,
[26:56.320 --> 27:00.920]  just because it's airy does not necessarily mean that that is not able to be
[27:01.200 --> 27:03.840]  high quality concentrates. And if you're not picky,
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.840]  you're going to put that bud in your grinder anyway,
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.080]  and you're going to spin that grinder and turn it into this little mulchy shit
[27:09.080 --> 27:10.120]  and you're going to roll the joint out of it.
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.440]  So if it's your grow and it's airy and fluffy and it's got like 38% THC,
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.200]  who gives a shit that it was fluffy, right? It might taste amazing.
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.080]  It might have all the trichomes in the world. And if it's just airy, who cares?
[27:24.080 --> 27:26.520]  As long as you're getting your weight that you expect that you need to meet
[27:26.520 --> 27:30.080]  your needs. Like if you're growing medically and you smoke two ounces a week,
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.440]  as long as you're pulling two ounces a week, maybe that's the product for you.
[27:33.440 --> 27:35.480]  Who cares that it's airy? There's nothing wrong with it.
[27:35.680 --> 27:38.400]  Other than it doesn't have bag appeal and it sucks to trim.
[27:38.760 --> 27:40.960]  If you're making concentrates, it's the way to go. All right.
[27:41.200 --> 27:43.360]  I feel like I've rambled on enough about that. Uh,
[27:43.400 --> 27:44.880]  thanks to my friends on Instagram live.
[27:45.120 --> 27:49.480]  First off for asking the question about more THC and airy buds.
[27:49.800 --> 27:53.160]  The answer there is there's more surface area. So technically by weight,
[27:53.360 --> 27:56.680]  there could be, there could be, it's not always a thing.
[27:56.840 --> 27:57.960]  There's not a general rule,
[27:58.200 --> 28:00.840]  but if it's coated in trichomes because there's more surface area,
[28:01.240 --> 28:03.200]  that is very possible. Also,
[28:03.200 --> 28:06.600]  big shout out to all of my friends who had the conversation with me a little bit
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.720]  on Instagram live and made me think about it. I appreciate all of you guys.
[28:09.760 --> 28:11.720]  I encourage everybody to follow me on Instagram live.

[28:35.880 --> 28:38.640]  podcast. If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple bucks,
[28:38.800 --> 28:40.640]  if you'd like to make a financial contribution,
[28:40.800 --> 28:43.720]  simply go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.

[28:48.400 --> 28:51.840]  and you can make a financial contribution to help keep the podcast alive.
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.800]  I do host the podcast on the IRI genetics, colorado.com website.
[28:56.800 --> 28:59.800]  I apologize for that website. It looks like total shit right now.
[29:00.400 --> 29:02.640]  I've been spending my energy more in the garden, more at work,
[29:02.680 --> 29:05.720]  more on the podcast than actually working on the website. I am not the web guy.
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.080]  I'm better at breaking the website than improving it.
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.880]  So I've got a guy that does that. We haven't spent any time together working on that.
[29:11.880 --> 29:15.200]  So I apologize. The website looks like shit, but it is alive and active.
[29:15.200 --> 29:16.960]  And that is where the podcast comes from.
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.920]  That's where the RSS feed is created.
[29:19.120 --> 29:22.040]  RSS feed is then sent out to all of the other services where you're able to
[29:22.040 --> 29:23.360]  listen for free.
[29:23.560 --> 29:28.000]  It does cost me a little bit of money to keep IRI genetics, colorado.com alive.
[29:28.200 --> 29:31.840]  I post a lot of content there. There are two episodes every week.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.880]  One of those episodes is about three hours every week. And then the other,
[29:35.320 --> 29:38.400]  it varies between 30 and an hour and a half just depends on who comes over and
[29:38.400 --> 29:41.480]  rambles with me, but it takes a lot of bandwidth to keep that website alive.
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.680]  So the people that contribute to Patreon,
[29:43.720 --> 29:45.920]  you were covering the cost of my website.
[29:45.920 --> 29:49.680]  You were keeping the podcast alive and free for everybody else. So thank you.
[29:49.880 --> 29:52.040]  I appreciate it. The other listeners appreciate it.
[29:52.320 --> 29:55.160]  If you were unable to contribute to Patreon, don't feel bad.
[29:55.320 --> 29:58.480]  Somebody else has got your back. Uh, in 2017,
[29:58.480 --> 30:01.160]  we did cover the cost of the website perfectly.
[30:01.280 --> 30:05.640]  We just barely covered the cost of the website, uh, by with Patreon contributions.
[30:05.800 --> 30:08.840]  So thank you guys. I appreciate that. Uh, they're covering it for you.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.120]  If you want to help out, I appreciate that. I feel like that's enough begging,
[30:12.640 --> 30:15.600]  but I do appreciate the love and support. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[30:15.720 --> 30:17.760]  I'll be back Thursday with the throwback Thursday episode.
[30:17.760 --> 30:21.240]  I want to thank you guys for listening to me ramble by myself for 30 minutes.
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.880]  I truly appreciate all the love and support.
[30:23.080 --> 30:25.800]  I've been getting a lot of messages on Instagram, a lot of emails,
[30:26.080 --> 30:27.280]  a lot of Facebook messages.
[30:27.440 --> 30:29.960]  I've been getting more and more interaction from a lot of people,
[30:30.080 --> 30:33.320]  people trusting me with their gardens, trusting me with advice and guidance.
[30:33.560 --> 30:36.600]  I truly appreciate it. Thanks for all the interaction, all the support,
[30:36.760 --> 30:40.000]  all the words of encouragement. It all means a lot to me. Um,
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.080]  I think that's all I've got for you.
[30:41.120 --> 30:43.000]  I'll be back Monday with a brand new episode.
[30:43.120 --> 30:45.840]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Michael P and until next time,
[30:45.840 --> 30:48.120]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:43.330 --> 31:46.730]  More than breakfast. Everyone on the center.
[31:53.810 --> 31:56.290]  People say that a sensei party,
[31:56.610 --> 31:58.610]  everyone jump run like them.
[31:59.650 --> 32:01.890]  Here comes the naughty dread.
[32:02.610 --> 32:05.130]  They say his name is Freddy.
[32:06.610 --> 32:07.930]  Long time already.
[32:14.330 --> 32:15.690]  Kid come Jamaica.
[32:17.490 --> 32:18.730]  She got a T pot.
[32:20.370 --> 32:22.210]  She smoked sense. Amelia.
[32:23.330 --> 32:25.210]  She spoke a sense. Amelia.
[32:28.650 --> 32:31.210]  All day on night in the party.
[32:31.450 --> 32:33.770]  Everyone's smoking sense of me.
[32:34.490 --> 32:36.730]  What's one? He walking out with the mouse.
[32:37.450 --> 32:39.690]  John Brown locked out of the house.
[32:40.330 --> 32:42.930]  On the eve of the sensei party.
[32:43.450 --> 32:46.090]  Yeah, the house started getting ready.
[32:46.410 --> 32:48.690]  So the band, roll a big fat sleep.
[32:49.490 --> 32:52.090]  And the lay down the big fat deep smoke.
[33:21.490 --> 33:24.010]  Here comes the mouse is a tower.
[33:24.330 --> 33:27.010]  Since you give him strength and power.
