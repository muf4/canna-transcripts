[00:01.020 --> 00:06.780]  All right. Welcome back podcast world. It is time for episode 532 of the grow from your
[00:06.780 --> 00:10.660]  heart podcast. I'm sure you have noticed on the other half of the screen. My buddy white
[00:10.660 --> 00:15.020]  Mike is here again. Welcome to the show, bro. What's up, man. Thank you for being back,
[00:15.020 --> 00:18.820]  bro. Thank you for finding some time. Sorry. I cut you off there. We got that slight zoom
[00:18.820 --> 00:23.300]  delay. We're going to get used to this. The zoom delay. Yeah. I think, uh, I think you
[00:23.300 --> 00:27.420]  just took a dab and I did not take a dab. So I'm going faster than you, bro. We're different
[00:27.420 --> 00:31.100]  dab right now. Yeah, we'll catch up. I was writing notes for the show and I gave you
[00:31.100 --> 00:34.700]  an opportunity to dab and I didn't take that dab so that I'm not clearing my throat every
[00:34.700 --> 00:38.180]  30 seconds. I think we're going to survive. Dude. Thank you for being here. Thanks for
[00:38.180 --> 00:42.980]  joining me again on video. Yeah, man. And for the folks who are not, uh, who are just
[00:42.980 --> 00:47.340]  listening on Apple podcasts or on stitcher radio or wherever you may find the audio version,
[00:47.340 --> 00:51.980]  this show is available in the video format on YouTube. So please, if you're interested,
[00:51.980 --> 00:56.860]  find us on YouTube, search for the grow from your heart podcast, click subscribe. Uh, episode
[00:56.860 --> 01:01.820]  five 30 featured Mike on video, uh, an episode before that features myself on video. And
[01:01.820 --> 01:06.100]  now we've got five 32 here with Mike on video. I'm going to try to keep the video feeds coming
[01:06.100 --> 01:10.860]  for you. It's the future y'all. It is the future and it's long overdue. Thank you for
[01:10.860 --> 01:14.300]  all of the words of encouragement for folks who tried to get me to do the video for so
[01:14.300 --> 01:18.540]  long. And then big thanks to, uh, I always shout out to dirt man, Dan and the embracing
[01:18.540 --> 01:22.860]  organics crew. They got me real comfortable on zoom, uh, without them, I probably wouldn't
[01:22.860 --> 01:26.540]  have done this. Also shout out to everyone on Instagram live who supports my Instagram
[01:26.540 --> 01:30.380]  live. That's where I learned how to do this really well. And then shout out of course,
[01:30.380 --> 01:34.900]  to Mike for coming on. Uh, he doesn't have much camera experience. He's doing so well
[01:34.900 --> 01:39.020]  for his first couple of shows. I'm impressed. So thank you, bro. But everyone go find the
[01:39.020 --> 01:43.380]  show on YouTube. If you were interested in seeing what these two, uh, two dudes coughing,
[01:43.380 --> 01:47.580]  see what we look like. Of course, this episode is brought to you by our friends. Damn, I
[01:47.580 --> 01:50.980]  didn't take a dab. So I wouldn't do that. My throat's doing it already. I want my money

[02:34.980 --> 02:39.060]  we just cover the Patreon part before we get jumping into the show? Mike do it. We've been
[02:39.060 --> 02:44.140]  getting, we've been getting a lot of Patreon support, a lot of contributions. I do appreciate
[02:44.140 --> 02:47.900]  it. This is the port. Thank you. Yes. Thank you guys. Mike has got a Patreon set up. We're
[02:47.900 --> 02:52.260]  going to talk about that after this. Um, this is the part of the, the part of the show where
[02:52.260 --> 02:56.380]  I do shout outs to the folks who support the show on Patreon. That was really hard for
[02:56.380 --> 03:00.180]  my brain to make happen, but we're going to do it. Let's start off by giving a giant shout
[03:00.180 --> 03:04.260]  out to my buddy, giant Mike and the Dabin queen. Let's also send a big shout out to
[03:04.260 --> 03:08.780]  Helly. I've got a giant shout out for my friend, Oki grow seven 20. Let's send a big thank
[03:08.780 --> 03:12.860]  you to Steve Smith. I've always got to thank you for my friend, Tommy. Of course, we've
[03:12.860 --> 03:17.060]  got to thank you for Tim. We've always got a big thank you. Shout out for Xavier. Of
[03:17.060 --> 03:21.620]  course, we got a big shout out for Tyler R and last but certainly not least, let's send
[03:21.620 --> 03:27.460]  a big thank you. Shout out to my friend, Adam S big thank you for all of the continued Patreon
[03:27.460 --> 03:30.820]  support. If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to
[03:30.820 --> 03:37.820]  do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of
[03:37.820 --> 03:42.580]  the information you need will be right there on the screen. And I did add a few new contribution
[03:42.620 --> 03:46.300]  tiers. So check out the updates I've made. There may be something there that interests
[03:46.300 --> 03:50.420]  you. And once again, thanks for all the support. And I did hint we were going to talk about
[03:50.420 --> 03:55.900]  Mike's Patreon. Mike has a Patreon campaign now he's been contributing to the show for
[03:55.900 --> 04:00.180]  years he's been on for 100 episodes. Now that we've got him on video, I convinced him to
[04:00.180 --> 04:06.900]  whip up a Patreon campaign. He's got a page it is patreon.com forward slash white Mike,
[04:06.900 --> 04:10.980]  it's real easy to remember how can you forget that? Please go support my bro white Mike,
[04:11.340 --> 04:15.580]  throw a few funds in his account, help him out for all the activism and support that
[04:15.580 --> 04:20.540]  he has done for us. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, man. Appreciate it. Yeah, anytime, anytime.
[04:20.540 --> 04:25.300]  Got to spread the love. They're taking very good care of me on Patreon. I see other Patreon
[04:25.300 --> 04:28.700]  folks doing very well. There's no reason why you shouldn't be a part of that. You are a
[04:28.700 --> 04:32.860]  huge contributor, not just to the show, but to the whole movement. You're part of the
[04:32.860 --> 04:37.100]  legalization effort. You're part of the community. So I've got to support you, bro. Thank you.
[04:37.100 --> 04:41.980]  I can while I can, man. Man, you're doing a lot. We, uh, the episode where we interviewed
[04:41.980 --> 04:45.220]  you, we, I learned about you. I learned stuff I didn't even know. So I'm sure the listeners
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.060]  are sitting there going, wow, this guy does a lot of shit and they learned a lot about
[04:48.060 --> 04:52.020]  you. So we missed a lot of stuff. And now until I was thinking about it last night and
[04:52.020 --> 04:57.540]  this morning, well, what'd you miss? Let's fucking jump into it. If you feel like it.
[04:57.540 --> 05:02.340]  There's just a lot of the in-betweens, like there was a whole long period where I help
[05:02.340 --> 05:08.220]  people design and build grow rooms in their houses. There was, yeah. When that dispensary
[05:08.220 --> 05:12.260]  closed down, that's where we went crazy. We learned how to build grows for people. We
[05:12.260 --> 05:16.780]  did private consulting. We were helping with all kinds of shit. And that's where I got
[05:16.780 --> 05:24.820]  really good at building private grows, private grows, driving plants around the state. We
[05:24.820 --> 05:29.540]  called it genetic acquisition was the technical words we use. We'll help you acquire genetics.
[05:29.540 --> 05:36.260]  It means I'll drive a tray of clones up to you.
[05:36.260 --> 05:40.300]  Some of those really early meetings where it was like driving Fort Collins with three
[05:40.300 --> 05:48.100]  people in a car so that everybody could pay 300 for the $1,500 lawyer fee to hear someone
[05:48.100 --> 05:54.500]  to break down amendments 20 for a whole room full of people. Do the wild West is for nutty
[05:54.500 --> 05:59.420]  man. Yeah. I don't know if you realized how long the podcast we did together was. So I'm
[06:00.300 --> 06:03.060]  I'm glad you, you skipped a little bit because it got long. There's nothing wrong with it,
[06:03.060 --> 06:06.300]  but that was one of our longest shows and it's really good. So don't have any issues,
[06:06.300 --> 06:07.300]  but it was okay.
[06:07.300 --> 06:10.780]  We've done like since the med was created.
[06:10.780 --> 06:15.180]  Oh yeah. Since we've gotten the marijuana enforcement division, our game has completely
[06:15.180 --> 06:20.340]  changed. Both of us had to shift gears and relearn everything. So yeah, I mean, if you
[06:20.340 --> 06:23.380]  feel like delving into that, we could talk about that right now, or if you'd like, we
[06:23.380 --> 06:25.180]  can do the white light interview for two.
[06:26.180 --> 06:29.500]  It's a three hour show. All right. I'm going to write down, we talked about, I'm going
[06:29.500 --> 06:32.940]  to write down white Mike part two on one of my notes here, and then we're going to do
[06:32.940 --> 06:36.540]  that in the future. But I just got to scroll it down and hit us up on social media. Let
[06:36.540 --> 06:41.500]  us know you want it. It's going to happen, dude. Cause I wrote a note. And when I write
[06:41.500 --> 06:46.020]  notes, it generally happens. Generally, if I don't write a note, it won't happen. But
[06:46.020 --> 06:50.780]  you know, it's official. It's in the binder now. It is. It is in the three ring binder.
[06:50.780 --> 06:55.700]  It's in the little magical notebook, which spawns all of these podcasts. It is the podcast
[06:55.700 --> 07:00.500]  friendly book. That's a fish joke. And I love you if you got it, Mike, I'm going to take
[07:00.500 --> 07:04.100]  a quick dab because I've noticed that I'm fast and you're slow.
[07:04.100 --> 07:06.660]  You want me to fill that's a dangerous proposition.
[07:06.660 --> 07:10.540]  Well, talk about something, but don't get too crazy. What's on your mind, buddy?
[07:10.540 --> 07:17.900]  Not much digging the zoom video, uh, zoom video shows, man. I, uh, it's time we took
[07:17.900 --> 07:23.540]  this step. We waited too long. Yeah. Um, we're a little silver lining of the pandemic.
[07:23.540 --> 07:27.980]  The next step, bro is to convince you to do live videos with me. We need to make a time,
[07:27.980 --> 07:32.180]  a spot once a week or once every other week where we could do this live and have a chat
[07:32.180 --> 07:36.180]  going. We can get a YouTube chat watching us and they can participate.
[07:36.180 --> 07:40.460]  It would be late. Um, but I bet we can do it. There's no reason we couldn't be doing
[07:40.460 --> 07:45.720]  that right now. Now here's something that crosses my mind is it's got to be late because
[07:45.720 --> 07:51.180]  we've got to make time for the family. Now, if Patreon, we're kind of sending you a paycheck
[07:51.180 --> 07:56.000]  in a way, then would the wife be a little more inclined to say, Oh, you mean from seven
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.200]  o'clock to eight o'clock or eight o'clock to nine o'clock, you're going to go play with
[07:59.200 --> 08:03.520]  your stoner friends. It would be a little bit easier. That's for sure. That's for sure.
[08:03.520 --> 08:06.780]  All right. Well, we're going to have to do what we can do to boost up that Patreon for
[08:06.780 --> 08:11.240]  you, bro. These late night bunker sessions might be the thing for a minute. These are
[08:11.240 --> 08:13.880]  a good time. We could always go live with these when you're comfortable, but I know
[08:14.280 --> 08:15.280]  I'm breaking you in slowly.
[08:15.280 --> 08:19.840]  It's nice and quiet in my house right now. Like a two year old and a four year old make
[08:19.840 --> 08:21.560]  it a ridiculous amount of noise.
[08:21.560 --> 08:25.280]  Yeah. It's probably the equivalent of me and the drum set. I'm going to hit this dab. So
[08:25.280 --> 08:29.080]  now is when I really need you to talk. So go for it. Just give me, you know, 40 seconds.
[08:29.080 --> 08:30.080]  All right.
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.200]  Narrate my dab if you'd like.
[08:34.200 --> 08:39.640]  Watch this hippie get all red faced and cloudy. Um, definitely check out our Patreons if you're
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.760]  interested in supporting the show. If you've got questions, you can hit us up on social
[08:44.760 --> 08:51.480]  media. My Twitter is at Nemo Punk 15. Facebook, you can find me at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.240]  Laws. Jeff will give you all of his social media handles when he comes down from that
[08:56.240 --> 08:59.320]  dab. Right. It's about now.
[08:59.320 --> 09:08.120]  Yeah. You can find me on Twitter at GFYH podcast or my personal. Wow, that was gross. My personal
[09:08.120 --> 09:13.800]  is at Rasta Jeff 420. I like the Instagram. I re underscore genetics on Instagram is where
[09:13.800 --> 09:20.040]  you're finding a lot of my cool cannabis photography. I was going to ask, is the audience interested
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.200]  in me using a lapel mic? Would that be better than this stupid mic here in front of my face?
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.240]  Do you want that lapel mic so that when I'm dabbing and shit, it's not so awkward. Is
[09:28.240 --> 09:32.000]  that worth the investment? That's what I'll use Patreon money on. If you guys vote that
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  I should do that.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.760]  That the next Patreon project getting this.
[09:34.760 --> 09:38.720]  Yeah, just well, yeah, because then you don't get off mic so much because when you move,
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.260]  it moves with you. It's your shirt. Yeah, it was easier before my old my chair at your
[09:43.260 --> 09:48.880]  place doesn't have wheels. This wouldn't reclines and has wheels. It's two things all over the
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.800]  place. Yeah. Yeah. And I just want to if I put it here, then I could move this out of
[09:53.800 --> 09:57.960]  the way and I could have my hands more available. I could use paper better. Just free up some
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.080]  space and you can see my stylish shirt. This is an ivory army shirt. You can't even fucking
[10:02.080 --> 10:07.760]  tell bro. It just says blue because you got the big blocking in the middle, right? It's
[10:07.760 --> 10:12.080]  all right. Podcast world. I am high as giraffe pussy after that dad. Thank you for hanging
[10:12.080 --> 10:14.880]  out with us for a few minutes. I know we've been rambling for several minutes. We haven't
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.960]  gotten to the what do they say the meat and potatoes of the podcast. You want to crack
[10:18.960 --> 10:23.520]  this sucker open and get to the main topic of the show tonight, Mike. I like to generate
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.840]  podcasts based on listener generated requests. That means emails. You guys, that's what I'm
[10:28.840 --> 10:33.120]  saying. When you send me an email and you ask a question, I know that I'm helping you
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.120]  because if somebody has that question, if one person asked the number say probably a
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.240]  lot of people wondered and only one person took the time to send the question. So we're
[10:42.240 --> 10:47.960]  going to answer a listener generated emails in this episode. If you've got to grow a cultivation,
[10:47.960 --> 10:51.720]  a cannabis culture, any sort of question that you think I can answer on the show, my email
[10:51.720 --> 10:57.760]  address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I would love to hear from you. The first email
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.840]  on today's episode. Well, I took that dab in my fucking I can't even breathe, but I
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.040]  still I'm talking. I'm doing it. Wow. Where have we been for the past 30 seconds? Do you
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.840]  need another minute before you have to read from a page? This is the funnest part. It
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.080]  is trying to read from the page when I can't even keep my fucking eyes open. All right,
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.120]  here we go. It says, use my name if you want. People call me wags. What up, wags? Thank
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.120]  you for the great email. It says thank you for everything you do. You are appreciated,
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.280]  Mike. We're appreciated, bro. Thank us. Our friend here is in prohibition land, so variety
[11:29.280 --> 11:33.560]  is not an option, which means they can't get strains like we can. We are spoiled. I went
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.880]  to the dispensary today and I chose from about 10 different things. We're spoiled here. It
[11:38.880 --> 11:43.280]  says I'm at the mercy of whatever my guy can get because of this. I have decided to grow
[11:43.280 --> 11:48.440]  my own. You're in prohibition land. Be very careful. I've read a couple of books and I've
[11:48.440 --> 11:53.240]  listened to a ton of podcasts. You are off to a great start. Most people buy seeds and
[11:53.240 --> 11:58.240]  then- You're a mile ahead of most beginners. Yeah. They put the cart way before the horse.
[11:58.240 --> 12:02.240]  So it says I've read books and listened to podcasts. Your podcast has by far been my
[12:02.240 --> 12:07.360]  favorite. Thank you. I don't think it's a competition, but I love hearing that you appreciate
[12:07.360 --> 12:12.840]  my work. I do appreciate that. It says you give a lot of knowledge in a way that almost
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.240]  anyone can understand. That is my goal. I understand that some people learn. I don't
[12:17.240 --> 12:20.640]  know the technical terms for it, but I know that when I went to school, I didn't want
[12:20.640 --> 12:23.960]  to learn the way the teacher was teaching me, but I had a couple of teachers who would
[12:23.960 --> 12:27.720]  say, hey, this is how it works and I would understand and care. So I know that you got
[12:27.720 --> 12:31.440]  to hit people at different angles to teach them. I've also got ADD and I get fucking
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.640]  bored. So I've got to entertain myself here to entertain you. So I make it fun so that
[12:36.640 --> 12:39.480]  I don't get bored. And then my stoner friends are like, yeah, it's fun and we can all learn
[12:39.480 --> 12:43.080]  together. I think a little bit of fun is like a reward for your brain. It's like a cookie.
[12:43.080 --> 12:45.960]  You get a bunch of knowledge and knowledge and then a joke. And you're like, oh, I can
[12:45.960 --> 12:49.240]  learn more, a knowledge, a knowledge and a joke. And it just keeps your brain fresh.
[12:49.240 --> 12:53.360]  I'm rambling because of that dab, but I'm glad that you understand or that you appreciate
[12:53.360 --> 12:58.120]  that I'm trying to teach multiple different ways. It says, maybe you should write a book.
[12:58.120 --> 13:01.160]  Mike's going to write a book. I thought about writing a book and that's what spawned the
[13:01.160 --> 13:06.040]  podcast. I was at Maddie and Spence's house and a bunch of people kept asking grow questions.
[13:06.040 --> 13:09.800]  Someone's like, five questions, the same questions and like write a book. And I was like, no,
[13:09.800 --> 13:12.960]  instead of a book, let's do a podcast. I'll just put a mic in front of my face and say
[13:12.960 --> 13:16.520]  all the same shit that I've said before. And then we'll just record it. And when people
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.840]  say, Hey, how do you dry and cure your plants? I'll go listen to episode three 26. Then I
[13:20.840 --> 13:23.400]  don't have to burn my throat out saying it again. And then you can listen to that in
[13:23.400 --> 13:27.840]  the car and we can have a conversation now as friends. It made things better. So I'm
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.080]  going to get back into the email because this will take 45 minutes if I keep doing it like
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.240]  this. It says, while the purpose of this message is just to say thanks and let you know that
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.640]  you're doing a great job. I also have a quick question. Well, thank you for reaching out
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.840]  and telling us we're doing a great job. That means a lot to us. We asked for Patreon contributions.
[13:44.840 --> 13:50.400]  But the people that just reach out and say good job. That means as much to me as a Patreon
[13:50.400 --> 13:54.720]  contribution. Like it recharges me and fucking I'm helping you. And that means a lot to me
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.920]  like money is awesome. But knowing that I'm helping that was the goal of the podcast.
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.320]  So that's fucking awesome. Thank you. Now there is a question. My main goal of growing
[14:04.320 --> 14:10.960]  is for medicinal purposes. Is there a strain which you can recommend for PTSD, depression
[14:10.960 --> 14:16.200]  and anxiety? Any information is appreciated. Thanks again for everything. Keep up the good
[14:16.200 --> 14:22.960]  work you rock from your friend wags. Wags. I've got a lot of great suggestions. I think
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.880]  Mike can chime in with a lot of great options. But before we get there, I should say that
[14:27.880 --> 14:33.440]  many of the things we're going to recommend are based on your body, your body chemistry,
[14:33.440 --> 14:38.640]  your physical condition, your brain chemistry. I'm not a doctor. So I can't recommend anything
[14:38.640 --> 14:44.080]  as a medical professional. What I can recommend is things from another person who has got
[14:44.080 --> 14:50.640]  a traumatic brain injury, which causes a little bit of PTSD. I duck for random fucking reasons.
[14:50.640 --> 14:56.320]  If something's here and I noticed I'm flinching because that hit to my brain ruined my life
[14:56.320 --> 15:02.400]  for a year and I don't so I've got PTSD and that gives me anxiety. I've noticed that for
[15:02.400 --> 15:06.140]  me this and I'm not a doctor. I can't I have to remind them that they know that or they
[15:06.140 --> 15:10.400]  look at me but still I'm trying to keep myself out of trouble. He's not a doctor. Not a doctor,
[15:10.400 --> 15:16.900]  bro. Dr. Dr. Rasta over here. Not a doctor but the things that work for me may not be
[15:16.900 --> 15:21.240]  the things that work for you. But what works for me is and I know it's crazy because I
[15:21.240 --> 15:26.440]  bred it and of course I'm going to talk about it but lemon Jeffrey is beautiful for my anxiety
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.240]  and PTSD. Sometimes I lock up. I don't want to go in public. I don't even want to talk
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.000]  to Mike. Take a dab of lemon Jeffrey and I won't shut the fuck up. I want to go everywhere.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.200]  Like it fixes I say that like if you got a record player in your brain, I got a little
[15:40.200 --> 15:44.760]  bit of a skip a couple spots on my record and it's just it but once you get past that
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.240]  the song will keep playing but it's going to skip a couple times and you know, everyone's
[15:48.240 --> 15:53.560]  got a CD or a burnt CD. They got off a Napster or Limewire in the fucking 90s that one song
[15:53.560 --> 15:58.440]  it's been one week since you looked at me and you know that every time in that fucking
[15:58.440 --> 16:02.040]  one song it's going to skip my brain has those and I know that it's coming up. I can
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.520]  feel it. It's there it was but the limonene and the lemon Jeffrey I feel like makes it
[16:06.520 --> 16:10.600]  wipes the macaroni off my dirty CD and it makes my record player spin smooth and I can
[16:10.600 --> 16:14.640]  function. So the first strain I'd recommend would be the lemon Jeffrey. The next one will
[16:14.640 --> 16:21.000]  be orange gasm something about those orange and lemon terpene strains really work well
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.840]  for anxiety depression and PTSD. Those are smiley strains. The lemon Jeffrey has limonene.
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.840]  I can't think of the the terpene right now off the top of my head and orange gasm. It's
[16:31.840 --> 16:37.000]  the orange turf. It smells just like fucking oranges. Then I would recommend a Jilly Bean
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.320]  Jilly Bean is not for me. That's from Miss Jill genetics. Jilly Bean has that orange
[16:41.320 --> 16:45.640]  candy flavor. It doesn't it doesn't like wreck you when you smoke it. You don't get like
[16:45.640 --> 16:50.160]  I'm so hot you get like, oh, I'm stone and it's like, you know, when you're when you're
[16:50.160 --> 16:53.840]  the first time you take Molly or the first time you take acid you want to tell everybody
[16:53.840 --> 16:57.480]  that you're tripping and that you're high and that it's fun. Like dude, I'm tripping.
[16:57.480 --> 17:02.120]  I'm tripping. You're just smiling about it. I ate Molly like that's that's like the stone
[17:02.120 --> 17:06.640]  you get from things like Jilly Bean and lemon Jeffrey and the orange guys which is the smiley
[17:06.640 --> 17:10.720]  like it look look how smiley I am. Hey Mike, you want to go to the mall and for no reason
[17:10.720 --> 17:14.360]  just go to the mall like you just get in a good mood and shit. I don't know if it's that's
[17:14.360 --> 17:20.560]  what it does to me. So if those sound like and those are mostly sativa heavy dominant
[17:20.560 --> 17:24.680]  types of strains. I don't know your body chemistry. Mike's going to agree with me
[17:24.680 --> 17:30.200]  when I say that those may give you a full on fucking panic attack, right? Yep. So just
[17:30.200 --> 17:38.360]  it really depends on you personally and because you're in prohibition land wags, it's gonna
[17:38.360 --> 17:43.160]  really depend on what you've got available to you. And it's unfortunately just gonna
[17:43.160 --> 17:47.340]  be a lot of trial and error. It kind of sounds like they're interested in purchasing some
[17:47.340 --> 17:53.180]  seeds from a local seed or from an online seed bank and giving it a try. So another
[17:53.180 --> 17:57.260]  thing I would recommend and would you agree with this my options people got? Yeah, would
[17:57.260 --> 18:03.300]  you recommend that also they may want to try some CBD because CBD will treat for all of
[18:03.300 --> 18:08.380]  these things. I would try everything you can get your hands on. Right. But they need to
[18:08.380 --> 18:13.100]  dial it in. So the way that I don't book, get yourself a notebook, you'll take a lot
[18:13.100 --> 18:18.780]  of notes, you're fucking right on top of it. Pick one. Pick if you can get you can
[18:18.780 --> 18:24.300]  get a CBD tincture delivered to you. You can order CBD from find a reputable CBD source.
[18:24.300 --> 18:28.340]  I'm not I don't want to say any of them because if I say a company I'm gonna get 50 fucking
[18:28.340 --> 18:33.420]  emails saying fuck that company. This one's better. Do some research and find a CBD company.
[18:33.420 --> 18:37.500]  All of the podcasts you listen to do a CBD ad at the start of them. If you listen to
[18:37.500 --> 18:42.900]  a popular podcast, they've all got a CBD ad now. Yeah, yeah. The one that Joey D get one
[18:42.900 --> 18:46.700]  from Joey Diaz or get the one that fucking Brennan Schaub uses because I like those people
[18:46.700 --> 18:50.660]  and I trust them and they probably advertise good shit. Joey uses the one that he advertises
[18:50.660 --> 18:54.700]  so and so does Brennan Schaub uses it on his son who's got a seizure condition. They both
[18:54.700 --> 18:59.940]  have valid reasons for CBD I would trust something they advertise but get it get a good CBD product.
[18:59.940 --> 19:04.580]  You can order it online wherever you are it'll come to you. Double up on whatever they fucking
[19:04.580 --> 19:09.740]  say to take CBD is not gonna have any adverse reactions. Double up on your smoker anyway.
[19:09.740 --> 19:17.300]  Extreme doses. What will go wrong? I'm learning not being it's there's a recent study out
[19:17.300 --> 19:26.380]  on CBD showing if you take and it's a lot. It's like I can't remember the milligrams
[19:26.380 --> 19:34.020]  but it was a couple hundred a day. It's like 50 milligrams per kilogram or some shit. Like
[19:34.020 --> 19:39.540]  it's a lot but if you get a thousand milligram bottle and try to pound half of it like you
[19:39.540 --> 19:45.340]  might tweak your liver a little bit like you would say I'm like a heavy night of drinking.
[19:45.340 --> 19:48.100]  They're not gonna tell you to take that much and he's gonna end up with a little bottle
[19:48.100 --> 19:52.300]  I bet you it's expensive but take some drops don't smoke. I mean you're gonna want to smoke.
[19:52.300 --> 19:57.300]  Do your homework first before you start taking a product. Yeah but but take some of it take
[19:57.300 --> 20:01.620]  what it says maybe a little bit more and see if it helps but don't smoke any herb that
[20:01.620 --> 20:06.580]  day take that shit and see if it helps you out. Then we know if CBD helps because it's
[20:06.580 --> 20:10.220]  gonna come on better. I think it's gonna work better in the drop form edibles work
[20:10.220 --> 20:13.620]  more quickly they were not more quickly but more effectively they're fucking they come
[20:13.620 --> 20:19.140]  on you notice them. So try the CBD tincture maybe that'll work for you. If it doesn't
[20:19.140 --> 20:23.500]  do what you need to do let's go the opposite direction and go with one of these THC dominant
[20:23.500 --> 20:28.100]  kind of sativa kind of style plants and see if that sort of stuff works for you. Unfortunately
[20:28.100 --> 20:32.260]  you're gonna have to grow those because you can't just buy that flower anywhere unless
[20:32.260 --> 20:35.460]  you've got some funding and you can take a trip out to Colorado and you can go hit a
[20:35.460 --> 20:39.380]  dispensary and you can just go buy a bunch of grams at different shops and go shop around
[20:39.380 --> 20:44.100]  and find different things and take notes and then from those notes you can dial it in and
[20:44.100 --> 20:47.980]  kind of see what's working for you and then try to find seeds or plants that work similar
[20:47.980 --> 20:52.860]  similarly to those strains. But that's a lot of work unless you can get out here. Yeah
[20:52.860 --> 20:57.900]  and unfortunately if you're looking to grow it at home you're gonna have like one good
[20:57.900 --> 21:04.540]  journal entry every hundred and twenty days. Yeah with growing it out and if you get dry
[21:04.660 --> 21:09.860]  and figuring out if it works or not and then trying the next one. So maybe find I don't
[21:09.860 --> 21:13.180]  know how big of a grow space you're gonna do or whatever I don't know anything about
[21:13.180 --> 21:16.820]  that. If you have a small space you can fit several plants in there. If you get feminized
[21:16.820 --> 21:23.020]  seeds maybe you got a five by five space under two cannons or maybe a 600 watt HPS light
[21:23.020 --> 21:27.260]  or maybe just a another kind of LED that's popular. I'm just spitting out things that
[21:27.260 --> 21:35.340]  would work. Put that in a five by five maybe do nine feminized seeds and do buy three packs
[21:35.340 --> 21:39.820]  of different shit. You know maybe get a lemon Jeffrey get something that CBD dominant maybe
[21:39.820 --> 21:45.340]  like an ACDC or what's the one I'm thinking of it's got a cool name Harlequin or Pennywise.
[21:45.340 --> 21:49.780]  I think all of those are CBD rich. You can find something that is CBD rich online from
[21:49.780 --> 21:53.340]  the same seed bank that will carry my stuff. So if you go to wherever you're going to find
[21:53.340 --> 21:59.460]  mine seeds here now you'll find the fucking CBD seeds there as well. So get some feminized
[21:59.460 --> 22:03.940]  CBD seeds get some feminized iri genetic seeds and then get something else that is right
[22:03.940 --> 22:09.020]  in the middle of that maybe an indica dominant or just a fucking 50 50 hybrid or something
[22:09.020 --> 22:13.580]  else to get your attention and grow three of three feminized three seeds each of three
[22:13.580 --> 22:17.320]  feminized and see which one of those makes you happy. And then you've still got half
[22:17.320 --> 22:21.100]  a pack of them seeds left of each one to work with. So if you find a keeper you can either
[22:21.100 --> 22:25.220]  order more seeds of that or you can fucking grow the other ones or maybe I don't know
[22:25.220 --> 22:27.980]  if you're able to keep a clone yet. I don't know your situation but if you've only got
[22:27.980 --> 22:31.860]  the one room that's three seeds of three different strains they're all females you're going to
[22:31.860 --> 22:36.100]  get nine plants to smoke and even if it doesn't perfectly work for your condition you got
[22:36.100 --> 22:42.060]  some weed to smoke and maybe maybe combinations of two of them or three of them or this one
[22:42.060 --> 22:45.260]  and this one or this one and this one or these three together maybe something out of all
[22:45.260 --> 22:52.660]  nine of those will really make it happen for you. Yeah. I wish we could be like just
[22:52.660 --> 22:59.420]  go pick up some you know blue moon at the liquor store. It's just especially in prohibition
[22:59.420 --> 23:05.860]  land it's a lot more difficult man. The beautiful part is those once he does find the plant
[23:05.860 --> 23:09.580]  and don't be discouraged if you don't find the plant on the first try. It's called a
[23:09.580 --> 23:14.580]  pheno hunt. Sometimes some of us spend years doing a pheno hunt. Don't be discouraged.
[23:14.580 --> 23:19.700]  But when you do find that one it's like finding your soulmate. Like watch when I say grateful
[23:19.700 --> 23:24.940]  dog watch Mike's face like see. Hard to be smart because in prohibition land there's
[23:24.940 --> 23:31.140]  no plant count. And so depending on where you live the plant count I mean the cops might
[23:31.140 --> 23:37.780]  consider like one to twenty nine plants the same. And so you've got a little more wiggle
[23:37.780 --> 23:45.060]  room than we do here because of Dummer laws. States just do minimal lighting and equipment.
[23:45.060 --> 23:49.260]  That's what's going to get you noticed. But also don't tell anybody. Look up the laws
[23:49.260 --> 23:53.100]  in your area so you know what you're getting into. And have a lawyer on retainer and have
[23:53.100 --> 23:57.180]  some money set aside because shit could go wrong and just always set aside bail money
[23:57.180 --> 24:02.580]  first. Yep. Yep. Yep. Make sure your lawyers got a duffel bag full of funding. Wags. I
[24:02.580 --> 24:08.340]  know I advertise my own brand but I breed things that I enjoy and I enjoy dabbing high
[24:08.340 --> 24:12.060]  lemonade and citrusy flavored stuff because I've got a brain injury that gives me the
[24:12.060 --> 24:17.140]  conditions which you were describing and they work for me. I don't know your body chemistry.
[24:17.140 --> 24:20.540]  Mike and I like similar but different shit when it comes to smoking. I know people that
[24:20.540 --> 24:24.100]  love way I don't like purple we purple we just never works for it doesn't do anything
[24:24.100 --> 24:28.380]  good to me like just that purple flavored turd isn't for me. So it's just all about
[24:28.380 --> 24:33.140]  our body our body chemistry what works for us and what we enjoy. I made a few recommendations.
[24:33.140 --> 24:39.220]  I hope they work. Like I said go for something limonene something orangey something CBD something
[24:39.220 --> 24:44.780]  indica maybe a 50 50 hybrid deadhead OG right in the middle there. Try something like that
[24:44.780 --> 24:48.380]  out. Try to get some fem seeds run the feminine I seeds so that you don't have to call the
[24:48.380 --> 24:53.020]  males. Keep it easy for yourself. Maybe if you can find how to take clones I've taught
[24:53.020 --> 24:55.980]  how to take clones of the show take clones of your favorites before they go into flower
[24:55.980 --> 25:00.180]  you got to take clones but keep your favorites and keep going. So why thank you for the great
[25:00.180 --> 25:03.580]  email. I hope I helped you out bro. If you have any more questions please reach out Mike
[25:03.580 --> 25:07.460]  and I are here to help you. Ladies and gentlemen if you've got more questions the email address
[25:07.460 --> 25:15.500]  is grow from your heart at hotmail.com Mike it looks like you're going to say something
[25:15.500 --> 25:20.180]  important. There it is. I cut you off this segway and what's on deck buddy. This next
[25:20.180 --> 25:24.740]  one comes I'm looking to see if they want their name said I'm an illegal grow and I
[25:24.740 --> 25:27.820]  are grows owner and I grow my own medicine but they don't say if I could say their name.
[25:28.140 --> 25:31.260]  Anyway it doesn't matter what their name is. This is from our friend. I'm just going to
[25:31.260 --> 25:35.900]  call him Nick. That'll work. It says hello Ross to Jeff. Thank you for the killer podcast.
[25:35.940 --> 25:40.620]  I've learned with the T bro. I've learned so much from you and your friends. Then this
[25:40.620 --> 25:45.460]  one especially starts with the white Mike. You rock. So you got a shout out in this message
[25:45.460 --> 25:51.380]  bro. It works makes me think of our friend John. That's a word that he used to say I
[25:51.380 --> 25:57.540]  learned. Yep. Learned. Yep. Goes on. It says what is what is your thought on extended
[25:57.540 --> 26:02.260]  darkness just before harvest. I finished a few crops and I've given them anywhere from
[26:02.260 --> 26:09.340]  24 to 48 hours of darkness just before I chop. I can honestly say I've I can't honestly say
[26:09.340 --> 26:14.340]  I've noticed any major boost in tricone production. I don't think that's enough time for tricones
[26:14.340 --> 26:19.180]  to happen. Maybe but they would just be a little they don't grow. They take. We've just
[26:19.180 --> 26:24.900]  spent 60 days producing tricones. Basically, we've been in flower for 6063 70 days. That's
[26:24.900 --> 26:28.380]  how long it's taken to get our track. We're tricone farmers. There's vegetation there,
[26:28.380 --> 26:33.180]  but we are farming tricones. So you're not going to see much tricone production in two
[26:33.180 --> 26:36.740]  days. You will see some things you'll see some density in the flower possibly you'll
[26:36.740 --> 26:42.220]  see some color changing. It's the plant is just starting to finish itself on the stick.
[26:42.220 --> 26:46.620]  But and think about this if tricones did pop up on the last 48 hours, they're not going
[26:46.620 --> 26:50.580]  to be right. They're just going to be tricones. We've been letting those looking with a scope
[26:50.580 --> 26:54.140]  for fucking two weeks going are they ripe yet? Are they amber yet? And now's the time
[26:54.140 --> 26:57.900]  and those if you pop them up at the last 48 hours, they're not amber. So you don't want
[26:57.900 --> 27:03.420]  those anyway, if that were a thing. The only thing I'm sure of is a very healthy pineapple
[27:03.420 --> 27:09.140]  express plant just finished. It seemed to wilt and go very limp after 24 hours of darkness.
[27:09.140 --> 27:13.720]  It made wet trimming a real pain. Oh man, I'm sure it almost seemed saturated. Although
[27:13.880 --> 27:19.360]  I hadn't watered it at least four days prior to turning the light off. I pineapple chunk
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.120]  plant I had in the same tent stayed firm and healthy and was easy trimming. Because of
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.800]  this I will refrain from giving them extended darkness. But I wanted to know your thoughts
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.160]  dude it sounds like you kind of answered your own question that one plant got pissed off
[27:32.160 --> 27:37.080]  at you for being in the dark. The fucking leaves went droopy. So it just stopped eating.
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.120]  And then all of the juice that was in the plant it couldn't put it out. It was like
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.640]  I can't transfer it respirate this water this air. So I'm just gonna try to spit it out
[27:43.640 --> 27:46.880]  through the bottom and actually probably remoisten the soil. I'm not sure if that's
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.720]  accurate but I think that that could be a thing it could have just remoisten the soil
[27:50.720 --> 27:53.480]  or it would all just stayed right there in the plant all that moisture would have been
[27:53.480 --> 27:58.000]  there in the buds. Then we knew what to cut it would have just been a sticky wet mess.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.120]  So I think you answered your question. You don't want to do the 48 hours or the 24. Sometimes
[28:03.120 --> 28:09.880]  it's useful. The thing is terpenes develop in the darkness. So if you turn off the lights
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.280]  before harvest and let those turps develop give it that natural night cycle or if you're
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.640]  unable to harvest right as the lights would normally come on like sometimes like right
[28:18.640 --> 28:21.880]  now Mike and I recording at midnight because he's got kids and I've got a crazy life. This
[28:21.880 --> 28:26.440]  would be a perfect time to harvest. So I would have left the lights off all day just because
[28:26.440 --> 28:30.160]  it's harvest time. We just left them off. They would have gone 24 full hours without
[28:30.160 --> 28:34.280]  light but I don't think that would fuck them up. I think the 48 is when you start pushing
[28:34.280 --> 28:40.720]  it. But the terpenes develop in that darkness the cool the dark you get more turps. So if
[28:40.720 --> 28:43.840]  you cut it in the dark time you're going to get more aroma and more flavor because that
[28:43.840 --> 28:48.360]  bright grow light kind of volatilizes some of your turps. The plants putting them off
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.320]  more at night so you're going to get more turps. That's the advantage of that. You may
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.000]  get a little more density the plant starts to kind of dry and cure itself on the stick.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.480]  But like you said bro if you're going to do that if you're going to go 24 or 48 hours
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.160]  chop off all those big families before you get in there. I like to kind of do a pre harvest.
[29:05.160 --> 29:08.960]  Do you hear that. Excuse me. That was a cough thing. I don't know what the fuck that was
[29:08.960 --> 29:14.560]  pre harvest family shave. Yeah. Oh yeah. Like a pre harvest little little manicure grow
[29:14.560 --> 29:18.520]  the more that helps. Yeah. Yeah. And then it just saves all that leaf material in the
[29:18.520 --> 29:22.440]  fucking final trim. It's not in the way it's not all caught up around the buds. All right.
[29:22.440 --> 29:25.960]  So I think I got that crap out of my throat. I think we can continue freely now. I apologize
[29:25.960 --> 29:31.160]  for that. I'm a professional I know better. Excuse me. So yeah I think you answered your
[29:31.160 --> 29:34.440]  own question dude. You don't want to do that again because it didn't work out. And if you
[29:34.440 --> 29:38.600]  do it do cut those leaves off. Anything you're going to do in the grow room have a strategy
[29:38.600 --> 29:43.200]  for why are you doing that. Did you hear about it on a podcast. Did they give you a reason
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.160]  did your bro say to do it. Did some guy that grew wheat a thousand years ago tell you to
[29:47.160 --> 29:52.680]  do it. You know what were you trying to accomplish was it just try comb production. Is the other
[29:52.680 --> 29:58.920]  thing that this is rumored to really do that I've never been able to play with enough to
[29:58.920 --> 30:04.800]  know if it works or not. But during the day the bud loosens up a little bit and at night
[30:04.800 --> 30:11.520]  it tightens back down. So you end up harvesting in theory with the nugs as tight as possible.
[30:11.520 --> 30:16.480]  If you kind of put a dark period first but very similar to that droopy leaves and a fucking
[30:16.480 --> 30:21.240]  nightmare trim when I've seen people do it. There you go. Well now we've got two testimonies
[30:21.280 --> 30:25.160]  droopy leaves and a fucking nightmare mess. Cut those leaves off if you can. They should
[30:25.160 --> 30:30.240]  have gone a couple of days ago. Honestly I cut those off a few days before harvest. This
[30:30.240 --> 30:34.240]  person wraps it up and says thanks Ross to Jeff and keep up all the great work you do.
[30:34.240 --> 30:38.640]  They signed it with their full name. Then it says P.S. I'm in a legal grow zone and
[30:38.640 --> 30:45.400]  I grow my own medicine bro. Keep growing. If you have any more questions please send
[30:45.400 --> 30:48.000]  them to me because I'd like to know what's going on in your growth. I'd like to help
[30:48.000 --> 30:52.320]  you out. So I was rereading the message making sure I got it all. Excuse me dude I drink
[30:52.320 --> 30:58.080]  a bunch of water and it's got my body free. Crazy. Yes stay safe. Stay healthy. All right
[30:58.080 --> 31:01.440]  Mike we've got one more email that I would like to cover in this episode. I like that
[31:01.440 --> 31:07.000]  you just gave me that go for it face. Get in there. This one says Ross to Jeff. I just
[31:07.000 --> 31:11.580]  signed up for Patreon. Thank you. I appreciate that. It says although at a small monthly
[31:11.580 --> 31:16.620]  level bro don't worry any contributions especially in these covid times people are doing weird
[31:16.660 --> 31:21.140]  shit. A lot of people are out of jobs. I appreciate that you threw me any sort of a contribution.
[31:21.140 --> 31:24.860]  I did not look to see what the amount was. I appreciate it. If it was the maximum or
[31:24.860 --> 31:30.020]  the minimum tier available. Thank you. I appreciate it. If you guys can't contribute to Patreon
[31:30.020 --> 31:33.580]  some people act like they shouldn't listen or whatever because they ask for a page on
[31:33.580 --> 31:37.620]  Patreon contributions. No listen do your best in the grow room. That's how you can pay me
[31:37.620 --> 31:41.260]  back. Go grow really good cannabis or tell somebody else about the show if you really
[31:41.260 --> 31:45.600]  want to do something. All right. So it goes on. It says I wish I could give more but my
[31:45.600 --> 31:50.720]  wife and I my wife my wife and I live on a fixed income. I get it bro. Trust me. I
[31:50.720 --> 31:55.080]  don't require a shout out. Well you're going to get a shout out bro. Having you read my
[31:55.080 --> 32:01.020]  email on episode 500 was pretty great. So I already know who you are. If you feel like
[32:01.020 --> 32:05.720]  you want to shout me out please use used to be cool. What's up used to be cool. I remember
[32:05.720 --> 32:10.240]  you bro. We've said your name quite a few times on this show. What's up. You said thank
[32:10.240 --> 32:14.040]  you for the great message. Thank you for the continued support bro. I'm excited to finally
[32:14.040 --> 32:18.320]  have you as a Patreon contributor and I understand that you and your wife are on a fixed income
[32:18.320 --> 32:23.740]  if it ever comes a time you have to revoke your Patreon contribution. Do it. Don't don't
[32:23.740 --> 32:27.880]  apologize. It doesn't hurt my feelings. Somebody sent me an email a few days ago saying bro
[32:27.880 --> 32:31.920]  I had to stop being a Patreon contributor. I apologize and I was like no no no no no
[32:31.920 --> 32:36.640]  it's it's COVID times. You take care of your family yourself. I get it. We will be OK.
[32:36.640 --> 32:40.380]  So don't ever feel bad you guys. I love you and thank you for all the support. There is
[32:40.380 --> 32:44.540]  more to the message though it says I just put a golden goat into flower and it is an
[32:44.540 --> 32:49.700]  amazing plant. I love hearing that. It says if you don't mind I'd like to share some photos
[32:49.700 --> 32:54.160]  and he shared photos with me and they look amazing. It says I went back at all. It says
[32:54.160 --> 32:58.760]  I went back and listened to your golden goat podcast. I took your it can take anything
[32:58.760 --> 33:05.210]  to heart. I'm going to press pause and clear my throat real hard and I'm going to continue.
[33:05.210 --> 33:09.850]  All right in the video that's going to look fucking real funky but it says so in the episode
[33:09.850 --> 33:14.050]  I did about golden goat I basically said that plant can take anything you fucking throw
[33:14.050 --> 33:18.050]  at it. She gets macro nutrient deficient so you can feed her real heavily you can twist
[33:18.050 --> 33:21.370]  or you can pop or you can bend her the fuck over you could spank her you could defoliate
[33:21.370 --> 33:25.130]  or you can light that bitch on fire and it will just keep on growing. So he took that
[33:25.130 --> 33:30.410]  to heart. He said I grow in super soil and I put it in almost 100 percent super soil
[33:30.410 --> 33:35.570]  and train the shit out of it with a combination of super cropping bondage and de-leafing and
[33:35.570 --> 33:40.730]  light de-leafing. It was nearly doubled in size in just a few days. So you should give
[33:40.730 --> 33:45.950]  yourself a shout out that golden goat did a good job for our friend used to be cool.
[33:45.950 --> 33:50.810]  So he listened to the podcast he learned how to grow it and our work together bro. I told
[33:50.810 --> 33:54.330]  you how to do it. You done it and it worked. I didn't go in your grow room and do any of
[33:54.330 --> 33:57.930]  that. You did that stuff. So good job bro. And then it says thank you for the great info
[33:57.930 --> 34:04.130]  and the entertaining content signed from your friend used to be cool. Hey bro you're still
[34:04.130 --> 34:08.410]  cool as fuck if you ask me you're in there growing i.re genetics you're emailing a show
[34:08.410 --> 34:12.850]  and you're also contributing to a patreon. Oh yeah. And you're growing golden goat man
[34:12.850 --> 34:17.130]  you are cool as fuck. You're fucking never used to still is cool bro. Put yourself on
[34:17.130 --> 34:21.650]  the cool team you get to decide a lot of those rock stars. They're just people bro. They
[34:21.650 --> 34:25.050]  walked out on stage one day and they go watch this bro watch and they went back to like
[34:25.050 --> 34:28.530]  a dickhead for 40 minutes in front of people and people fell for it. And now they're rock
[34:28.530 --> 34:31.690]  stars and they just continue it every night now since then. It's all it takes to be a
[34:31.690 --> 34:39.110]  rock star. Fucking decide bro. Put a sock in your jeans and rock. All right Mike this
[34:39.110 --> 34:43.150]  is a good time to start wrapping up the podcast. I'm obviously stoned and getting weird. I
[34:43.150 --> 34:45.790]  like to give you an opportunity at the end of the show here to say anything that might
[34:45.790 --> 34:50.510]  be on your mind sort of like a Mike's moment. You've been kind of quiet this episode. Mike
[34:50.510 --> 34:56.710]  Scott nothing just be kind to each other. That's probably to get through you know the
[34:56.710 --> 35:01.870]  most important message we could give is be kind to each other. Yeah I really think I
[35:01.870 --> 35:07.230]  mean I've been trying to duck away from the social media a minute today which is a little
[35:07.230 --> 35:11.910]  bit unusual for me but I think the world be a better place for everybody if I can hit
[35:11.910 --> 35:16.550]  their ball and just relax a little bit more. Guaranteed. Put the social media away. Do
[35:16.550 --> 35:20.950]  that. Yeah put your phone away for just a day. Hang out with the family. Maybe call
[35:20.950 --> 35:26.550]  somebody instead of just scrolling around. Yeah it's good. Be good to everybody. Call
[35:26.550 --> 35:31.150]  your mama. All right you guys my throat has told me that we're done podcasting so it is

[39:06.590 --> 39:07.590]  Move.
[39:07.590 --> 39:08.590]  Move.
[39:08.590 --> 39:09.590]  Move.
[39:09.590 --> 39:10.590]  Move.
[39:10.590 --> 39:11.590]  Move.
[39:11.590 --> 39:18.340]  Move.
[39:18.340 --> 39:21.540]  So many wack MCs, you get the TV bozak
[39:21.540 --> 39:24.240]  Ain't even gonna call out your names cause you're so wack
[39:24.240 --> 39:26.840]  For one big oaf, who's faking her plastic
[39:26.840 --> 39:29.840]  A dictionary definition of the word spastic
[39:29.840 --> 39:32.240]  You shouldn't ever start us up, you couldn't finish
[39:32.240 --> 39:34.740]  Cause white fries to me is like pie but it's spinach
[39:34.740 --> 39:37.740]  I'm fat ass, move your fat ass cause you're wack son
[39:37.740 --> 39:40.440]  Dancing around like you think you Janet Jackson
[39:40.440 --> 39:42.240]  Watch you go up on me, then get some ground
[39:42.240 --> 39:44.640]  I walk up on a rug, I run under your ass
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.140]  As I talk on, I'll take you out like a snipe on a roof
[39:48.140 --> 39:50.840]  Like an MC at the fever in the DJ booth
[39:50.840 --> 39:53.440]  With your headphones strapped, you're rocking rewind pause
[39:53.440 --> 39:56.140]  Trying to figure out what you can do to go for yours
[39:56.140 --> 39:59.040]  But like a pencil to the paper, I got more to come
[39:59.040 --> 40:01.640]  One after another, you could all get some
[40:01.640 --> 40:04.240]  So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
[40:04.240 --> 40:06.840]  Cause this shit'll be stinking when I go for mine
[40:06.840 --> 40:09.440]  And that's right y'all, don't get uptight y'all
[40:09.440 --> 40:12.240]  You can't say shit because you're biting what I write y'all
[40:12.240 --> 40:15.040]  And that's wrong y'all, over the phone call
[40:15.040 --> 40:17.740]  You can't cut no mustard when you're frontin' it on
