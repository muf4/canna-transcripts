[00:15.160 --> 00:40.930]  What's up, Podcast World? It is the first of the month. It is Throwback Thursday, and
[00:40.930 --> 00:44.290]  it's time for episode number 212 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. That's right, I'm
[00:44.290 --> 00:49.610]  coming in with a bonus Thursday episode. This week, I am not doing the chunk of old episodes.
[00:49.610 --> 00:54.850]  This week, I am doing something a little bit differently. We are going to do a garden,
[00:54.850 --> 00:58.090]  first of the month garden checklist. I've got a list of things that you should be checking
[00:58.090 --> 01:02.130]  on in your garden. Maybe you should check on it more frequently than you do. The first
[01:02.130 --> 01:05.130]  of the month is always a good time to do a garden check. Before we get to the garden
[01:05.130 --> 01:10.050]  checklist, let me do an update on an old episode. On an episode, I think it was the last episode
[01:10.050 --> 01:15.370]  with Mike, we read an email about keeping the turps loud at harvest time. One thing
[01:15.370 --> 01:20.570]  I didn't mention was fresh frozen. If you really want to keep those turps loud, chop
[01:20.570 --> 01:25.290]  down the plants, cut the buds off the sticks, get them into a bucket, and freeze them. That's
[01:25.290 --> 01:29.050]  right. Live resin is made with fresh frozen material, and it is the turpiest shit you
[01:29.050 --> 01:34.410]  can get. The HCFSC can be made with fresh frozen or dry material. It seems to come out
[01:34.410 --> 01:39.450]  better with frozen. If you want to keep the turps loud, freeze that shit is your best
[01:39.450 --> 01:40.450]  bet.
[01:40.450 --> 01:43.930]  All right, so let me dig into the notes I've got here. I've got a whole bunch of notes.
[01:43.930 --> 01:47.730]  We're just going to go over some things that you can do on the first of the month that
[01:47.730 --> 01:51.770]  would greatly improve your garden, probably prolong the life of some of your equipment,
[01:51.770 --> 01:56.770]  and maybe give you a few more grams per watt in your grow. Let's get right to it. On the
[01:56.770 --> 02:00.730]  first of the month, something I always like to do, clean my air conditioning filters.
[02:00.730 --> 02:04.410]  If you've got a home grow with a portable air conditioner, you've got that filter that
[02:04.410 --> 02:08.250]  pops right out of the back. Just pop that up, take it to a hose, take it to a sink,
[02:08.250 --> 02:13.370]  just rinse it off, wipe it off real good, put it right back. It doesn't take much effort.
[02:13.370 --> 02:17.090]  Whatever kind of air conditioner you've got, check the filters, see if they need to be
[02:17.090 --> 02:20.410]  replaced, see if they need to be cleaned, see how often it needs to be done, and do
[02:20.410 --> 02:24.250]  it today. It's the first of the month. Go check them right now. If they're clean, that's
[02:24.250 --> 02:27.970]  cool. Write it down. Think about how long away from now you need to check them. Go check
[02:27.970 --> 02:31.090]  them on the first of next month. If they're dirty, fucking change them. Then keep an eye
[02:31.090 --> 02:35.130]  on how long those things last without getting super dirty.
[02:35.130 --> 02:38.930]  Something we should go over before we get too far, get a calendar, get a notebook, start
[02:38.930 --> 02:43.210]  making some notes, start making some check marks. If you don't know when the last time
[02:43.210 --> 02:46.450]  you did some shit was, how do you know how long things last? How do you know when the
[02:46.450 --> 02:49.810]  next time you need to change that bulb or change that filter? How do you know if you
[02:49.810 --> 02:55.370]  don't write it down? Get a calendar, make a Google document, some shit, make some notes,
[02:55.370 --> 02:57.370]  keep things in check.
[02:57.370 --> 03:01.770]  Another thing I would recommend, check your bulbs. I would recommend getting a lumen meter.
[03:01.770 --> 03:06.590]  Get a lumen meter and a piece of string or a lumen meter and a ruler. What you're trying
[03:06.590 --> 03:12.090]  to do is put that ruler and the lumen meter, you're measuring the distance from the bulb
[03:12.090 --> 03:16.130]  so that you can be consistent. So that every time you measure the distance from the bulb,
[03:16.130 --> 03:20.790]  you were 12 inches away or 18 inches away, whatever you choose. Then you know exactly
[03:20.790 --> 03:24.430]  how many lumens you're getting at that distance. I like to use just a piece of string and hang
[03:24.430 --> 03:27.330]  the lumen meter. When the string hangs, you go right here and you're like, oh, that's
[03:27.330 --> 03:30.610]  that many inches. Then every time you know you're that far from the bulb.
[03:30.610 --> 03:35.890]  So a lumen meter, check the bulbs. You may be, here's one thing. If you are pumping electricity
[03:35.890 --> 03:40.050]  into a bulb and that bulb is almost dead, it's still receiving all of the electricity
[03:40.050 --> 03:43.730]  but it's not putting out the lumens or the par watts. So you're spending money and you're
[03:43.730 --> 03:47.750]  not doing shit to your plants. You're just burning money. It's just the boxes outside
[03:47.750 --> 03:51.330]  spinning. Your power meter is just going, but you're not getting shit out of it. So
[03:51.330 --> 03:56.930]  replace that bulb if it's not living up to your standards. And then write a note, mark
[03:56.930 --> 04:01.090]  down how long that bulb has been in there. Every time you put in a new bulb market, they
[04:01.090 --> 04:04.970]  should only go from one, maybe two cycles. I don't like to let them go longer than that.
[04:04.970 --> 04:09.130]  These double ended bulbs, they just burn out. They don't give you any warning. Swap them
[04:09.130 --> 04:15.410]  out after one or two crops. That is my recommendation. Carbon filter covers. You guys, I am guilty
[04:15.410 --> 04:19.970]  of this. My carbon filter cover completely looks like shit. In my photography, it looks
[04:19.970 --> 04:24.490]  black. I have taken it off and I have cleaned it with OxiClean. I don't know what else to
[04:24.490 --> 04:28.170]  do, but I know it's not filled with dust and dirt. It's cleaned up. Some of you guys need
[04:28.170 --> 04:30.810]  to take that shit off there and clean it. Some of you guys just need to cut it off of
[04:30.810 --> 04:33.730]  there and throw it away and get a brand new one from the pictures I've seen on some of
[04:33.730 --> 04:38.650]  your Instagrams. So your carbon filter cover may need to be cleaned. Your carbon filter
[04:38.650 --> 04:42.690]  itself may need to be replaced. We're going to talk about that and just a few more things
[04:42.690 --> 04:47.970]  here. Check your RO filters. If you're running RO water, check those filters and membranes.
[04:47.970 --> 04:51.690]  They may be getting funky. They may be sludged up. You may be wasting more water than what
[04:51.690 --> 04:56.370]  you're actually cleaning. You might want to check on that stuff. Check all of your RO,
[04:56.370 --> 05:00.010]  the fittings, the seals, everywhere where it reaches or where it connects. Check all
[05:00.010 --> 05:05.610]  that stuff. Make sure it's well sealed and not leaking. Check, clean the glass in your
[05:05.610 --> 05:09.810]  sealed hoods. If you've got those ducted hoods, like a Magnum with glass in it, clean that
[05:09.810 --> 05:16.410]  glass inside and out. Debris, carbon filter dust, shit flies around inside of there randomly.
[05:16.410 --> 05:20.130]  Clean that. Let the bulbs cool down before you get in there and clean it. Unplug that
[05:20.130 --> 05:24.330]  shit, wait like 45 to an hour, and then get in there and clean the inside of that glass.
[05:24.330 --> 05:29.090]  Clean the outside of that glass. Also, make sure that all that ducting is sealed. Make
[05:29.090 --> 05:33.290]  sure that all of your, from the, let's see, from the blower or from the carbon filter
[05:33.290 --> 05:37.230]  to the blower to the ducting to the light to the other side of the light to the outside,
[05:37.230 --> 05:40.090]  make sure that all of that is sealed. Make sure you don't have any air leaks. Make sure
[05:40.090 --> 05:45.050]  you don't have any light leaks. All right? Check the timers for accuracy and settings.
[05:45.050 --> 05:49.050]  I know this sounds like a no-brainer, but sometimes power goes out. Sometimes equipment
[05:49.050 --> 05:54.130]  fucks up. Go look at all of your timers. Make sure they are set for the correct time. Maybe
[05:54.130 --> 05:58.010]  daylight savings time happened and you didn't fix it. Just go make sure they're all set
[05:58.010 --> 06:02.430]  at the correct time. Also, make sure they're set for the correct cycles. Maybe you fucked
[06:02.430 --> 06:06.150]  up something. Maybe you had an idea. Maybe you got high one night and bumped into something.
[06:06.150 --> 06:12.570]  Just go check. It's always a good idea. Let's see. What else? Check your smoke alarms and
[06:12.570 --> 06:16.810]  fire extinguishers. I know that isn't something we all think about, but if you are growing
[06:16.810 --> 06:21.970]  cannabis in a home or a commercial environment, you should have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers
[06:21.970 --> 06:26.010]  on hand. What are you going to do if you have a fire and you don't have a fire extinguisher?
[06:26.010 --> 06:29.450]  You're going to burn down the fucking house. You're going to be that guy that burned down
[06:29.450 --> 06:34.490]  the house growing weed. So have a smoke alarm inside the grow. That's my advice. And have
[06:34.490 --> 06:38.650]  a smoke, a fire extinguisher. That word was hard to pull out of my brain. Have a fire
[06:38.650 --> 06:43.650]  extinguisher outside of the grow space. If something does, I don't want it to ever please
[06:43.650 --> 06:47.610]  John no fire. But if some fire does happen in your grow, you don't want to run in there
[06:47.610 --> 06:50.890]  and discover it and have the fire extinguisher in there where the fire is. You want to be
[06:50.890 --> 06:54.890]  able to kick open the door with that fire extinguisher in hand and spray the shit out
[06:54.890 --> 06:58.730]  of it. It's going to cost you your plants, but you want a house more than any of those
[06:58.730 --> 07:04.130]  fucking plants. So check on your smoke alarm and fire extinguisher. Check the battery.
[07:04.130 --> 07:07.290]  Make sure that battery is good. Make sure that smoke detector beeps like it's supposed
[07:07.290 --> 07:13.170]  to. Make sure that your, uh, your fire extinguisher has a nice heavy charge on it. Make sure it's
[07:13.170 --> 07:16.450]  still got some juice in there. There's a little gauge on there that'll tell you and they come
[07:16.450 --> 07:19.970]  with a date. They only last so long until you have to go get them recharged. So check
[07:19.970 --> 07:24.850]  that stuff out. Safety is important. You guys, uh, if you were using CO2, get your CO2 set
[07:24.850 --> 07:29.490]  up, inspected, um, or get it refilled. If it needs to be refilled, start refilling it
[07:29.490 --> 07:33.330]  on the first and 15th. If it lasts you two weeks, but get check everything. Make sure
[07:33.330 --> 07:37.450]  that your meter is working well, run it too high and see if it's got a safety feature
[07:37.450 --> 07:42.090]  on it. Test that shit. Uh, do it while you're there so that if it does fuck up, you know,
[07:42.090 --> 07:47.530]  it's going to have a safety turnoff when you're gone. Test it. That is my advice. Uh, what
[07:47.530 --> 07:52.890]  else can you do on the first of the month? Um, I said earlier, checking about on like
[07:52.890 --> 07:56.330]  light leaks and using your, uh, checking for carbon filter problems and needing to
[07:56.330 --> 08:00.890]  replace your carbon filter. Here's something a lot of people don't think about. Go outside
[08:00.890 --> 08:06.610]  your grow and walk around. Go check for smell. Go check for light leaks. Go check for anything
[08:06.610 --> 08:11.250]  that doesn't look ordinary. Go check for odd sounds. Go check for anything that would make
[08:11.250 --> 08:16.530]  you think, Hey, there's a grow in here because if you walk by, go walk your dog, go do something
[08:16.530 --> 08:20.370]  random and just walk around your house. A few extra times. Go, go look like you're doing
[08:20.370 --> 08:23.290]  something. Go be suspicious at your own house. You can walk around, but what you're actually
[08:23.290 --> 08:26.930]  doing is looking to see if you can hear, see, or smell anything that is involved with your
[08:26.930 --> 08:31.970]  grow. And if you can hear, see, or smell anything, you need to correct it. Maybe you can feel
[08:31.970 --> 08:35.810]  something. Maybe you can feel the ground vibrating from a blower you've got in the basement.
[08:35.810 --> 08:39.530]  I never know what you could have going on, but go check for light leaks. Go check for
[08:39.530 --> 08:43.610]  smell leaks. Go check for any damage you may have done when you were working inside and
[08:43.610 --> 08:48.010]  didn't pay attention to the outside. Because if you notice it, then somebody else will
[08:48.010 --> 08:51.850]  notice it because people are fucking nosy. There's one person in your neighborhood that
[08:51.850 --> 08:56.850]  wants to catch you slipping for some reason and don't give them the reason. Okay. They're
[08:56.850 --> 09:00.170]  either going to smell it. They're going to see it. They're going to do something and
[09:00.170 --> 09:02.850]  they're going to get nosy and they're going to get curious. And if they can see it or
[09:02.850 --> 09:06.970]  smell it, then law enforcement may get involved. Maybe the person that sees it, smells it,
[09:06.970 --> 09:11.530]  hears it, feels it. Maybe they are a thief or a crook. Uh, just be careful. You don't
[09:11.530 --> 09:15.290]  want to put yourself in any position you don't need to be in. So just go out there and check
[09:15.290 --> 09:21.370]  it out. Um, I said earlier, get a calendar and make notes of all of these checks and
[09:21.370 --> 09:25.910]  start doing this on the first and maybe on the 15th of every month. And I really think
[09:25.910 --> 09:32.610]  that a few small steps like this could greatly improve your garden. Also, it's a good idea
[09:32.610 --> 09:38.950]  to go in the grow room during your light cycle. If it's light outside, okay. When it's light
[09:38.950 --> 09:42.330]  outside or light wherever else, go in your grow room and turn off the lights and see
[09:42.330 --> 09:47.290]  if you are getting any light inside of the room coming from the outside. See if you're
[09:47.290 --> 09:52.010]  getting a light leak from under your door. See if there's a hole in your ducting. Sometimes
[09:52.010 --> 09:55.850]  the light will travel down ducting and right back through your light reflector and the
[09:55.850 --> 10:00.010]  sunshine will work like your light and you'll be getting sunshine in your plants during
[10:00.010 --> 10:04.450]  your night cycle or just depends on how your shit's going. But we're talking about check
[10:04.450 --> 10:11.010]  for light leaks during your cycles in your grow. If you're see my, my lights are on at
[10:11.010 --> 10:15.330]  night so the sunshine is on, the sunshine is up while my plants are asleep. So I really
[10:15.330 --> 10:19.490]  have to make sure no sun gets into my grow in my personal grow. That's what I'm talking
[10:19.490 --> 10:22.570]  about. I don't know what you've got set up, but make sure no lights getting in during
[10:22.570 --> 10:27.130]  your dark cycle. Also, it may be a good idea to put some green lights in there and just
[10:27.130 --> 10:31.210]  pop in once or twice and see what the night cycle feels like. How humid is it? How funky
[10:31.210 --> 10:35.570]  is it? Is there anything weird in there? Just pay attention to what's going on in your grow.
[10:35.570 --> 10:39.450]  A few things like this would greatly improve your cannabis. You may spot something that
[10:39.450 --> 10:42.450]  you did not know about. I had a friend that had some huge problems. He couldn't figure
[10:42.450 --> 10:46.570]  out what was wrong with his plants. He called me over. Uh, it was during his day cycle.
[10:46.570 --> 10:50.270]  I said, turn off all your lights. We looked and you could see light just beaming in through
[10:50.270 --> 10:54.130]  one window where the board wasn't over properly. And that was what was causing all of his plants
[10:54.130 --> 10:59.230]  in one section to harm. So something small could be something huge could save you a lot
[10:59.230 --> 11:04.090]  of money, could give you some better product. All right. I hope that was a quick rundown
[11:04.090 --> 11:07.130]  on stuff you should do on the first of the month. Oh, also I skipped a couple of things.
[11:07.130 --> 11:13.170]  There's a small section here. I skipped calibrate your PPM meters, calibrate your EC meters,
[11:13.170 --> 11:16.410]  calibrate all of your shit. Now is a good time to calibrate it. It's the first of the
[11:16.410 --> 11:21.250]  month. Also do a water test. See what's coming out. Maybe there's something in there that
[11:21.250 --> 11:24.810]  you weren't aware of. Maybe you need to adjust to the water that's coming out. I like to
[11:24.810 --> 11:29.410]  do a water test every now and then and write down the PPMs and the EC and the, uh, the
[11:29.410 --> 11:35.250]  TDS and see what's in my water. Just so I know I'm just weird like that. Also clean
[11:35.250 --> 11:39.810]  up. The first is always a good time to clean up. There's a mess you've been dodging. Clean
[11:39.810 --> 11:43.810]  up. Also it's the first of the month. Pay your electric bill, pay your rent, pay all
[11:43.810 --> 11:48.530]  of your bills and don't look suspicious. That will help you keep the grow going. All right,
[11:48.530 --> 11:52.370]  you guys, I feel like I ran through the checklist. Uh, let's see what else did I want to talk
[11:52.370 --> 11:58.050]  about today? Keeping your garden clean and organized and keeping all of your nutrients
[11:58.050 --> 12:03.450]  and your pesticides all organized is a huge part of garden cleanliness and organization
[12:03.450 --> 12:07.170]  is a huge part to me about having a successful garden. I was talking about writing everything
[12:07.170 --> 12:11.970]  down. I write down every feed I give my plants. I write down every spray I give my plants.
[12:11.970 --> 12:16.010]  I write down a lot of shit. I have a Google document where I write some things. I have
[12:16.010 --> 12:20.830]  a notebook where I write some things. Uh, my phone is filled with cannabis wizardry.
[12:20.830 --> 12:26.570]  What I'm getting at is the garden you are growing is a reflection of yourself as a person.
[12:26.570 --> 12:30.650]  I think when I walk into somebody's garden, I can see the inside of their mind. I can
[12:30.650 --> 12:34.170]  see the chaos that is in their mind. I can see the order that is in their mind. I can
[12:34.170 --> 12:38.930]  see their thought processes by the way they organize their gardens, their grow lights,
[12:38.930 --> 12:43.770]  their rows of plants, uh, how their nutrients are taken care of. I think a garden is a reflection
[12:43.770 --> 12:48.290]  of yourself. If you are growing straight for money and for greed and for shit purposes,
[12:48.290 --> 12:51.930]  your garden will show it. If you're growing from your heart and breeding with love, your
[12:51.930 --> 12:56.730]  garden will show it. Uh, if you are too chaotic and too fucked up in your life right now,
[12:56.730 --> 13:01.650]  your garden will show it. If you are focused and centered and doing things correctly, your
[13:01.650 --> 13:06.450]  garden will really probably reflect that as well. If you were a person like me, most of
[13:06.450 --> 13:11.250]  the gardens I've been to, I can see this. Um, I have been too many personal private
[13:11.250 --> 13:15.090]  gardens for years and years. I was a consultant here in a small town when the medical marijuana
[13:15.090 --> 13:19.930]  boom took off and I got to visit, I've been in a hundred private gardens in this town
[13:19.930 --> 13:25.130]  and I, I can see if you've lined up 10 people and then let me walk into 10 grow rooms and
[13:25.130 --> 13:28.410]  then put them all like, put the guys in a lineup. I can go, yeah, that guy goes to
[13:28.410 --> 13:32.130]  grow room a, that guy goes to grow room B. I could probably assign the people with a
[13:32.130 --> 13:37.670]  short interview and a little of, of who has which grow because I think the gardens reflect
[13:37.670 --> 13:42.850]  ourselves that very much. So take care of your garden because it is a reflection of
[13:42.850 --> 13:46.510]  you. The pride you put in your garden shows, it shows in your finished product, it shows
[13:46.510 --> 13:52.890]  in your pictures, it just shows we can see it. Um, also your, your nutrient decisions
[13:52.890 --> 13:57.950]  strongly show me, uh, what you have in mind for this plant. It shows me if you're growing
[13:57.950 --> 14:01.370]  for just money, if you're growing for quality, if you're growing for patients, if you're
[14:01.370 --> 14:07.250]  growing for your nutrient selections, strongly show me where your heart and mind are in your
[14:07.250 --> 14:11.890]  grow. And yes, I'm using veg bloom at a commercial grow because we are growing on a commercial
[14:11.890 --> 14:16.270]  level. I'm also using veg bloom in my private grow and I'm also using botanic or I use botanic
[14:16.270 --> 14:20.490]  care at home in my personal grow because I think it tastes the best. That's my favorite
[14:20.490 --> 14:24.890]  flavor. It gives my herb something funky. It just that it's a lot of, uh, chicken shit
[14:24.890 --> 14:28.650]  and seabird guano and stuff like that. And I think that sea product that's in there,
[14:28.650 --> 14:31.650]  it really makes my bud taste good. That's why I use botanic care because I've been using
[14:31.650 --> 14:35.890]  it for a long time. I've tried a lot of other bottled nutrients and botanic care gave me
[14:35.890 --> 14:42.050]  the flavor I like. Uh, I don't spray with ridiculous stuff. I don't feed my plants ridiculous
[14:42.050 --> 14:45.290]  stuff. Botanic care is mostly on the organic side. It's got some stuff in there that's
[14:45.290 --> 14:51.650]  not, but most of the products do. I don't do the fully organic stuff because I don't
[14:51.650 --> 14:56.250]  feel, I don't want to do that in my home grow. It's just, I don't need it. It's a bedroom.
[14:56.250 --> 14:59.370]  I don't feel I'm supposed to be doing that in a bedroom. I think bottles are a little
[14:59.370 --> 15:03.930]  cleaner and safer, uh, for this home that I am in. That's just my opinion. If I had
[15:03.930 --> 15:07.850]  a farm, we'd be doing no till all day. We'd have worms. We'd have a worm farm. We'd be
[15:07.850 --> 15:11.650]  scraping up our own chicken shit. It would be a different story. But like I said, I use
[15:11.650 --> 15:16.650]  veg bloom at the big row because it's a big row and veg bloom is a really clean product.
[15:16.650 --> 15:20.610]  Uh, the people are really cool and it burns so smoothly when you use veg bloom. I don't
[15:20.610 --> 15:26.130]  think it leaves a whole bunch of crap behind. So, um, your garden is a reflection of yourself.
[15:26.130 --> 15:30.530]  The nutrients you choose to use are a reflection of yourself and the pest management program
[15:30.530 --> 15:34.850]  that you use are a reflection of yourself. So think about that when you're playing with
[15:34.850 --> 15:38.650]  your gardens. One more thing I wanted to talk about, uh, just kind of loop it all around.
[15:38.650 --> 15:43.050]  Since I've been taking care of ganja plants for longer than I should admit because I've
[15:43.050 --> 15:46.690]  been growing and fucking with weeds since way before all this medical marijuana shit,
[15:46.690 --> 15:52.770]  uh, the more I learn about cannabis and nutrients and the nutritive cycle of cannabis plants,
[15:52.770 --> 15:57.890]  the more I'm inspired to take better care of myself. Uh, I realized more that what I
[15:57.890 --> 16:03.570]  put in since you feed cannabis plants so infrequently and when you feed them, you definitely see
[16:03.570 --> 16:08.210]  results. I've noticed that I try to pay more attention to what I put into me. I try to
[16:08.290 --> 16:13.250]  take in a wider variety of nutrients and more specific nutrients. I try to just pay a little
[16:13.250 --> 16:17.690]  bit more attention since I pay so much attention to the plants. If I'm measuring out this much
[16:17.690 --> 16:21.370]  nitrogen and this much phosphorus and this much potassium and then a little smidge of
[16:21.370 --> 16:25.970]  cow mag and then put in some kelp in there and then some microbes also for my plants,
[16:25.970 --> 16:30.250]  why wouldn't I think about my own body like that? Why wouldn't I love my plant like that?
[16:30.250 --> 16:34.330]  Why wouldn't I love my branches and my roots just as well? So I think taking better care
[16:34.330 --> 16:37.890]  of plants has made me take better care of myself and it's made me learn a lot more about
[16:37.890 --> 16:42.130]  my health. It's made me care a lot more about my health and it honestly has made me think
[16:42.130 --> 16:46.370]  a lot more about my hydration since water is the only, you can just feed these plants
[16:46.370 --> 16:49.330]  water for their whole lives and they would grow. So it makes me think, should I need
[16:49.330 --> 16:53.450]  a lot more water? I drink plenty of water, but I could drink a lot more. You probably
[16:53.450 --> 16:58.290]  could too. Every time you take a dab, drink a bottle of water, three dabs, bottle of water.
[16:58.290 --> 17:02.850]  I don't know. I'm not a fucking Scientologist, but do your own ratio there. Every time you
[17:02.850 --> 17:07.130]  take some dabs, drink some water. All right, you guys, this is going to be a quick Thursday
[17:07.130 --> 17:10.610]  episode. It's only going to be about 18 minutes, but I hope it was good for you. It was good
