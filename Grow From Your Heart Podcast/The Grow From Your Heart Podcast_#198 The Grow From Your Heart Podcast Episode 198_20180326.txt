[01:00.550 --> 01:03.990]  friends that are at the table. I had to clear the throat again. I apologize. Ladies

[01:10.630 --> 01:15.670]  working like crazy and running around. Traveling? Yeah. Traveling. How was Vegas?
[01:15.670 --> 01:23.830]  Vegas was... The look on your face, dude. Holy shit. Because Vegas is crazy. Good. Vegas is always crazy. I know what
[01:23.830 --> 01:27.150]  happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but you know, you can tell us what you want. Yeah,
[01:27.150 --> 01:31.710]  I mean like that event, well I mean the after-party we threw in Vegas was just
[01:31.710 --> 01:39.350]  crazy. Big shout out to Brett, Fresh, Daily Bong, Taylor, Chris, Granny, and everyone
[01:39.350 --> 01:43.210]  else that was a part of that. Every sponsor, every everything, because my god.
[01:43.250 --> 01:47.050]  It looked like a huge party. Over here to my left, also speaking of the party in
[01:47.050 --> 01:51.850]  Vegas, the guy who worked the boom mic for the movie that happened. The boomstick guy.
[01:51.850 --> 01:56.210]  The phrase Granny porn happened at my table a little bit ago.
[01:56.210 --> 02:02.210]  There might have been a little extra after-hour movie action going on. So the Dabbing Granny and our
[02:02.210 --> 02:06.690]  friend Brett are now movie stars and Bobo Blastico over here got to be the guy
[02:06.690 --> 02:10.370]  that operated the boom mic. Welcome to the show, bro. Thank you, having this again.
[02:10.370 --> 02:15.250]  Yeah, man, it's been a while since you guys been here. Yeah, it's been a while. You've been at the house chilling, taking dabs, but we haven't put mics out for a minute.
[02:15.250 --> 02:18.770]  It's been all weird. Why haven't we done this? I don't know. We've just been friends, chilling.
[02:18.770 --> 02:31.530]  It's cool. I'm surprised you don't put ninja mics everywhere. I should. Just drop some mics from the ceiling. I feel like one day I'm gonna come in and you're just gonna hit enter on your computer and you're just gonna like some have some really incriminating stuff on me.
[02:31.530 --> 02:37.890]  You're giving me ideas that nobody in the podcast world can see my face right now, but I'm like, shit, I'm just gonna hang mics from the chandelier.
[02:38.730 --> 02:40.730]  I just saw you like as the wrestling judge.
[02:42.730 --> 02:55.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, it just come right. Really good mics. We just need one that hangs against everybody. Perfect. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, coming up on future episodes, incriminating shit from Chris and Lindsay.
[02:55.610 --> 02:56.770]  Big Brother podcast.
[02:57.210 --> 03:04.490]  Let's not do that to anybody. All right. Um, so let's talk more about Vegas. We were talking about the party. What happened at that party that we could talk about?
[03:05.210 --> 03:16.210]  Um, well, actually, uh, we, um, I can't even think. Uh, it was really crazy. We had to do the party. Um, Brett did.
[03:16.490 --> 03:29.890]  Brett from Mary Mary's motivation on Instagram. All right. Also known as Evo Labs. Brett. Yeah. The guy. Brett. Wild and crazy kid. Brett. Yeah. Brett. Dance like a freak on Instagram. Brett. We love you, Brett. I love you so much. I loved.
[03:29.890 --> 03:56.130]  Did you guys see his dab slut video when we came back from? Yeah, I kind of can't handle that. I can't handle it. He's nailed it. It's too good. Brett. You're awesome, dude. I hate that. I live 130 miles away from you. That sucks. We need to get together more frequently. Yes. I work a lot. That's just a shitty excuse. Let's get together one of these days and take some dabs. We will make that happen. Yes. Um, maybe at the dude grows cup. Maybe Brett will be there. Yes. Maybe. You never know. I'll be in Denver. So find me.
[03:56.130 --> 04:26.090]  Uh, Devin granny was at the event obviously because there was a Brett and granny. There was not really a porn. You guys, it was a spoof. It was it. Well, I'm telling myself in my head. It was a joke. I really don't know what happened in Vegas. It was, it was a joke. Yeah, for sure. I hope so. Yeah, for sure. It was definitely a joke. The funny part of recording that whole thing was that like we had a bunch of people keep coming into the house and stuff as we were in the middle of recording. So we would like each shoot. We would like get a shot. I'm like, that was great. That was great. Let's try that.
[04:26.130 --> 04:55.650]  This instead. And then we would do another shoot and somebody would like walk in as we're setting up. We'll be like, all right, quiet on set, quiet on set. And he'd be like, what the fuck did we just walk into? That's fucking hilarious. Who was the video crew that recorded everything? Fresh, fresh did most of the recording out there. Uh, so, uh, yeah, the videos that I saw were great. I think they were all from fresh. Those were great videos. All the stuff on your Instagram on Brett's Instagram. Yeah. All the professional videos were done by fresh. Also big shout out to Earl tycoon. He looks like he's having a good time.
[04:56.570 --> 05:25.410]  Ty was killing it out there. He had brought all the slabs for dab. Skidball. Nice. What was the event that took you guys out there? Uh, the cannabis cup. Okay. I wasn't sure why everybody went. Yeah. Yeah. Boycotting that crap. You said something that we got to rewind on. You said dab. Skidball, dab. Skidball. Uh, people in Oklahoma, they're fucking Iowa are going dab. Skidball. What the fuck are these Colorado people doing? So, um, so somebody has now created a banger where there is a backboard on the banger.
[05:25.490 --> 05:49.770]  I talked about banger on the last episode. I hope you guys were there. Um, so they have, and it's, they've marketed as dab. Skidball. So, um, the glass mule is a, who was out there with the, uh, the dab, skidball nails and everything. And so I take this banger with the backboard and I hit the banger and I throw my dab at it just like I'm playing basketball. And it has a bubble cap for it. And now what if I miss?
[05:49.770 --> 06:19.690]  You gotta just keep going. You just gotta keep shooting. Where does the dab go? So the way we played it, we played it on a big table and we played it one verse one and we just lined up like five dabs, six dabs, basically. So each side, each person got three dabs and you just heat it up. The second they return to red, you give a 10 second cool down. You start throwing. And the trick is to throw it as fast as you possibly can to make it the first shot. So the other person has to take a hot and hurdy. I don't even think they waited 10 seconds, by the way. I think they just started shooting. That's the trick. So you just try to get it.
[06:19.770 --> 06:35.410]  Make it right away and just hot and hurdy. There you go. Little half gram dab real quick. So you're just throwing half gram dabs across the table. There are people in other places right now that want to punch themselves in the forehead hearing that shit. They threw a half gram dab across the table with the chance of missing and losing that half gram.
[06:35.410 --> 06:45.250]  No, don't get me wrong. There was literally like 30 kids around this table and the second it fell, they were like, where'd it go? Where'd it go? I got it. I got it. Everybody was just like tossing that dab right back on the table.
[06:45.250 --> 06:46.370]  Dab rescue unit kids.
[06:46.370 --> 06:49.010]  Yeah. I never really made it off the table.
[06:49.010 --> 06:56.130]  Where can people see some video from the Vegas party from your after cannabis gut party hosted by Brett Mary's motivation, the wild and crazy kid.
[06:56.490 --> 06:57.530]  There's one page right there.
[06:57.530 --> 07:01.210]  Go to Mary's motivation and check it out. Follow him. Also follow Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[07:01.810 --> 07:04.130]  Bro, you've got a lot of Instagram activity.
[07:04.130 --> 07:05.250]  Which one should we follow?
[07:05.570 --> 07:06.690]  Bobo Blaster Co.
[07:06.690 --> 07:14.130]  All right. Follow Bobo Blaster Co. You can see some party stuff. You can apparently see a picture of the podcast happening. I just saw that happen on one of your guys's phones.
[07:14.170 --> 07:14.690]  That's me.
[07:14.730 --> 07:15.410]  Nice.
[07:15.530 --> 07:19.810]  And then of course, the man who got most of the footage, John L.J. Fresh.
[07:19.890 --> 07:21.850]  Oh, yes. Big shout out to John L.J. Fresh.
[07:21.850 --> 07:24.530]  Him and I have been talking. We're going to do some stuff in the future.
[07:24.970 --> 07:26.690]  We've talked about things.
[07:27.010 --> 07:30.690]  He's one of my favorites right now. He makes me so happy. He's just so sweet.
[07:31.690 --> 07:32.690]  Love Fresh.
[07:32.690 --> 07:37.410]  He may need a male voice for a cannabis related project in the future.
[07:37.610 --> 07:40.050]  And he has talked to me about being a voice.
[07:40.410 --> 07:41.170]  Being a voice.
[07:41.170 --> 07:42.090]  I've got one of those.
[07:42.090 --> 07:42.570]  Do you?
[07:42.570 --> 07:44.370]  I have a good voice and some recording gear.
[07:44.610 --> 07:46.090]  It works. I know how to turn it on.
[07:46.090 --> 07:46.650]  That's about it.
[07:47.410 --> 07:47.930]  All right.
[07:48.450 --> 07:52.290]  Lindsay, a couple of episodes ago, you were here and Granny and I were giving you shit.
[07:53.210 --> 07:55.090]  We keep trolling you about this fucking website.
[07:56.050 --> 07:57.050]  Can't troll you anymore.
[07:57.490 --> 08:00.090]  Can't troll me anymore. You guys troll me so much I went and made it.
[08:00.090 --> 08:00.690]  Yeah, it worked.
[08:00.690 --> 08:01.770]  I was like, screw you guys.
[08:01.770 --> 08:03.570]  Screw you guys. I'm going to make my website.
[08:03.570 --> 08:04.810]  I'm going to go home and play on my computer.
[08:04.810 --> 08:07.090]  Screw you guys. Digital, digital. Clickety clack.
[08:08.050 --> 08:09.690]  So it's up and it's running and it looks good.
[08:09.690 --> 08:10.530]  Congratulations.
[08:10.530 --> 08:12.770]  Thank you. It's up.
[08:12.850 --> 08:14.850]  It's running. It is super successful.
[08:14.850 --> 08:16.610]  And I guess I should thank you and Granny for that,
[08:16.610 --> 08:18.610]  because you guys trolled the fuck out of me.
[08:19.050 --> 08:21.530]  But you guys can head over to the traveling stoner dot com.
[08:21.850 --> 08:24.250]  There is an about me page.
[08:24.250 --> 08:26.410]  There is a blog page.
[08:26.410 --> 08:32.130]  My sponsors are up there with different links to their website and my discount codes.
[08:33.290 --> 08:38.050]  The YouTube channel, the YouTube channel was supposed to be out at the end of March,
[08:38.050 --> 08:40.890]  but I just got that really nice Nikon camera.
[08:40.890 --> 08:43.410]  So, yeah, because I've been playing around with it.
[08:43.410 --> 08:48.530]  I'd rather put out a YouTube channel that I'm proud of than like rush something out
[08:48.530 --> 08:51.170]  and just put something out that I'm kind of like not happy with.
[08:51.170 --> 08:54.610]  Yeah. So I'm still playing around with the camera and
[08:55.570 --> 08:57.330]  I'll say it on here. I don't care.
[08:57.330 --> 09:01.050]  Kyle's moving. Daily Bong is moving out here after 420.
[09:01.330 --> 09:05.610]  And so I have a feeling that having him out here will help me a lot with my YouTube channel.
[09:05.650 --> 09:07.770]  Oh, yeah. Guaranteed. Shout out to Daily Bong.
[09:07.970 --> 09:10.770]  You said you had some sponsors and that your sponsors are listed on your website.
[09:10.770 --> 09:14.810]  It would be polite and kind of you to give a shout out to like two or three of your favorite sponsors right now.
[09:15.170 --> 09:18.130]  Sure. Vi Vaporizers is definitely one of them.
[09:19.170 --> 09:23.570]  Empire of Wellness, definitely loving their CBD right now.
[09:23.810 --> 09:26.290]  They have turped up CBD crumble.
[09:26.610 --> 09:28.450]  Their gummies are about to hit the market.
[09:28.450 --> 09:30.570]  Actually, I have some of them right here with me.
[09:30.570 --> 09:32.650]  I just happen to if you want to try some of them.
[09:32.770 --> 09:34.370]  I will eat one of these.
[09:34.370 --> 09:35.890]  Just one. I don't do the edibles.
[09:35.890 --> 09:37.970]  Everybody knows that it's just one five milligram.
[09:38.010 --> 09:39.770]  Yeah, yeah. One five milligram CBD.
[09:39.770 --> 09:41.810]  I'm in. I've got some inflammation in a hand.
[09:41.810 --> 09:43.330]  This will be wonderful. Yeah.
[09:43.330 --> 09:47.290]  And then canister, actually, they're the grinders and the riot tool and stuff.
[09:47.290 --> 09:49.770]  That's a huge grinder. You can grind like an ounce of weed in that thing.
[09:49.770 --> 09:52.250]  Yeah, for sure. That's they don't even make that size anymore.
[09:52.250 --> 09:55.130]  That's Chris's three and a half inch on.
[09:55.130 --> 09:57.010]  That's old school. You can grind a whole bunch of herbs.
[09:57.010 --> 09:58.250]  So I'm getting one of these out.
[09:58.250 --> 10:01.850]  I like the texture so far, and I like that it's coated in this little crunchy sugar.
[10:01.850 --> 10:04.130]  It's going to be so delicious. It's going to be so delicious.
[10:04.130 --> 10:05.090]  It's really good.
[10:05.090 --> 10:09.330]  So you said Vi and you said these edible guys and you said the grinders.
[10:10.370 --> 10:12.250]  Let's talk a little bit of I'm going to throw this in my mouth
[10:12.250 --> 10:14.410]  and be a rude podcaster, just chew on this fucker while we talk.
[10:15.890 --> 10:17.010]  Damn, Jeff, how could you?
[10:17.010 --> 10:18.850]  I was really delicious.
[10:18.850 --> 10:19.730]  It's going away quickly.
[10:19.730 --> 10:22.970]  So you brought these Vi vaporizers.
[10:24.810 --> 10:27.330]  I'm a hard guy to sell on a vaporizer, and I like this.
[10:27.970 --> 10:30.890]  I like how we're going to talk more about it, you guys.
[10:30.890 --> 10:31.850]  I'm just giving my quick
[10:31.850 --> 10:33.850]  and I've only messed with it once or twice for a couple of minutes.
[10:34.090 --> 10:35.730]  I like how easy to fill it is.
[10:35.730 --> 10:38.450]  I like that you can fill those little canisters and have them kind of preloaded
[10:38.450 --> 10:39.290]  like shotgun shells.
[10:39.290 --> 10:41.450]  I could just eject one and put the other one in.
[10:41.450 --> 10:43.410]  I liked how easy it was to operate.
[10:43.410 --> 10:44.570]  I didn't clog up on me.
[10:44.570 --> 10:49.130]  Every handheld portable smoking device I've ever used,
[10:49.130 --> 10:52.610]  I fucking ruined within two or three days because I overheat them or they melt
[10:52.610 --> 10:54.330]  or I clog them up.
[10:54.330 --> 10:56.530]  This one seems like they have solved all those problems
[10:56.810 --> 10:59.810]  and it came with enough tools that if I do fuck it up, I'm sure I can fix it.
[11:00.890 --> 11:02.770]  She's exhaling or she's going to talk.
[11:02.770 --> 11:04.970]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Sorry.
[11:05.970 --> 11:09.890]  So tell I'll give you a chance since you brought these to us and I like it.
[11:10.130 --> 11:15.010]  Tell us a little bit or a lot if you want to about these Vi handheld.
[11:15.010 --> 11:16.330]  Actually, mine's a limited edition.
[11:16.330 --> 11:17.490]  I'm going to tell you what it looks like on my own.
[11:17.490 --> 11:18.850]  And then I'll let Lindsay talk about it.
[11:18.930 --> 11:20.410]  She's kind of choking from a dab also.
[11:20.410 --> 11:21.490]  So I'm going to give her a second.
[11:21.490 --> 11:23.570]  Now, I like your descriptions anyway, so go for it.
[11:23.570 --> 11:25.690]  It's a sweet green metallic.
[11:25.690 --> 11:28.050]  It's about the size.
[11:28.050 --> 11:30.490]  I I don't even know what that's comparable to.
[11:30.770 --> 11:33.490]  It's the size of like a battery, a battery pack.
[11:33.690 --> 11:36.850]  Yeah, the battery pack I was going to use as compared to another vaporizer,
[11:36.850 --> 11:37.930]  but I don't want to say their name.
[11:37.930 --> 11:41.330]  It's very similar to that size, but I like it better because I've used that one also.
[11:41.610 --> 11:43.570]  And that one's only good for flower this one.
[11:43.810 --> 11:45.250]  So it's green. Mine is green.
[11:45.250 --> 11:47.010]  It's like a green metallic color.
[11:47.010 --> 11:49.730]  It's about the size of a little like an iPhone portable charger.
[11:49.970 --> 11:51.290]  This one is a limited edition.
[11:51.290 --> 11:55.370]  It's number two, 48 of 400, and it's got a sweet Colorado logo on it.
[11:56.010 --> 11:57.770]  Is this 400 total?
[11:57.770 --> 11:59.330]  Is that how many they're going to make completely?
[11:59.330 --> 12:00.490]  Yeah, in that color.
[12:00.490 --> 12:04.090]  And with the Colorado logo on it, there will only be 400 made.
[12:04.130 --> 12:06.810]  Nice. So I've got number 248 of this one.
[12:07.090 --> 12:08.690]  Sweet. I've got a limited edition.
[12:08.690 --> 12:10.290]  And of course, I got to have the Colorado one.
[12:10.290 --> 12:12.850]  I mean, come on. And green, of course, with the Rasta man that loves green.
[12:13.210 --> 12:15.810]  So it's got a button here with the little V on it.
[12:15.810 --> 12:16.770]  You've told me how to use it.
[12:16.770 --> 12:17.610]  It's super simple.
[12:17.610 --> 12:19.610]  It's got a little spot on the bottom where you can unscrew it
[12:20.050 --> 12:21.850]  and you just load in preload.
[12:21.850 --> 12:22.570]  They're not preloaded.
[12:22.570 --> 12:25.650]  You load them yourself, but you load in cartridges that you can preload
[12:25.650 --> 12:27.850]  before you get to wherever you're going so you don't have to be
[12:27.970 --> 12:31.330]  wherever you are trying to fill your containers because that kind of sucks.
[12:31.970 --> 12:34.210]  It's got a nice this is plastic on the top here.
[12:34.210 --> 12:35.210]  This mouthpiece. What's that?
[12:35.210 --> 12:37.330]  OK, it's got a nice plastic mouthpiece.
[12:37.330 --> 12:40.650]  I like it. And I'm really hard to sell on a handheld.
[12:40.930 --> 12:42.930]  They is it a vape?
[12:43.130 --> 12:45.490]  What would you call it? Handheld vaporizer? Yeah. OK.
[12:45.970 --> 12:47.890]  I'm hard to sell on it and I'm going to use it.
[12:47.890 --> 12:50.810]  I have a couple of places I have to go soon where this is going to come in.
[12:50.810 --> 12:52.170]  Super handy.
[12:52.610 --> 12:56.890]  Yeah, I actually sat on the focus group for the last year and a half.
[12:58.650 --> 13:01.170]  Like helping them to develop this.
[13:01.850 --> 13:06.690]  So a year and a half ago, they came like someone came to me and said,
[13:06.690 --> 13:09.490]  would you like to sit on a focus group? And I said, sure.
[13:09.490 --> 13:11.290]  Excuse me. Now I've gotten myself all
[13:12.730 --> 13:15.090]  tickled. You're all choked up.
[13:15.130 --> 13:16.530]  Give her a dab, Chris. That'll help her out.
[13:16.530 --> 13:18.770]  That'll help me. Yeah.
[13:20.250 --> 13:21.770]  So a year and a half ago,
[13:21.770 --> 13:24.730]  someone came to me and asked if I wanted to be on a focus group, and I said, sure.
[13:25.410 --> 13:30.810]  So they brought a product out that was looked exactly similar to this,
[13:30.810 --> 13:33.410]  but had different program software into it.
[13:33.890 --> 13:36.730]  And they said, well, what do you think about this?
[13:36.970 --> 13:40.050]  And we sat on a focus group for three days and we, you know,
[13:40.050 --> 13:43.890]  we went back and forth and we gave our opinions on it and all this kind of stuff.
[13:44.330 --> 13:49.090]  So we've actually gone through and developed this with it
[13:49.090 --> 13:53.170]  because after we were all done with the vaporizers on day three,
[13:54.010 --> 13:57.770]  Chris and I broke out the rigs and we started dabbing and, you know,
[13:57.770 --> 14:02.170]  we started showing them how important concentrates are to this cannabis
[14:02.170 --> 14:07.210]  community. And once they saw that, well, and I shouldn't say they, once Barack,
[14:07.210 --> 14:10.370]  the, the inventor of this device,
[14:10.690 --> 14:14.450]  once Barack saw how, um,
[14:15.610 --> 14:19.890]  passionate we were about like dabs and how important, um,
[14:20.170 --> 14:23.330]  concentrates are to us. He was like, Oh,
[14:23.330 --> 14:27.610]  I need to go back and completely change this and, you know, redo it.
[14:28.010 --> 14:29.690]  So he did,
[14:29.890 --> 14:33.490]  he went back and then he came back again with a whole new product. I mean,
[14:33.490 --> 14:36.690]  it's the same like shape and everything, but it is completely like,
[14:37.130 --> 14:41.090]  the inside is completely different the way it cooks and all that kind of stuff.
[14:41.090 --> 14:45.930]  So, um, yeah, to be honest with you, I'm not a vaporizer person either.
[14:45.930 --> 14:47.530]  Really, you know that. Um,
[14:47.890 --> 14:52.370]  but Barack is so passionate about this and, um,
[14:52.490 --> 14:56.730]  he stands behind this so much that you almost kind of, when you meet him,
[14:56.730 --> 15:00.970]  you almost kind of like, can't not get behind him. You're kind of like, yeah,
[15:01.250 --> 15:05.130]  that's okay. All right. And then when you start to use it, you see how, you know,
[15:05.250 --> 15:06.330]  how great it is too.
[15:06.610 --> 15:10.850]  So Barack's whole vision for this started because he, um,
[15:11.210 --> 15:15.770]  he's actually, uh, a vaporized, like has a vaporizing,
[15:16.090 --> 15:20.690]  fat below, excuse me, has a vaporizer making factory in China.
[15:21.330 --> 15:22.890]  And he would, um,
[15:23.770 --> 15:27.010]  he would have these people come to him with different like designs and stuff.
[15:27.010 --> 15:27.890]  And, you know,
[15:27.890 --> 15:30.570]  he would sell it to them for one price and then they would sell it to
[15:30.570 --> 15:34.850]  distributors and distributors sell it to vaporizer or excuse me, um,
[15:34.850 --> 15:39.410]  retailers. And then, you know, us as the consumers pay 400 to 500%.
[15:39.970 --> 15:44.090]  His super affordable piece that he made got marked up by just like everything
[15:44.090 --> 15:46.330]  else in this industry, just like any consumable product,
[15:46.330 --> 15:49.170]  they got marked up by every hand that touched it. Every driver that drove it.
[15:49.570 --> 15:53.170]  Yeah. Okay. All right. So he started, he had an epiphany and he said,
[15:53.170 --> 15:58.010]  what if I bring a great quality vaporizer
[15:58.570 --> 16:00.410]  that anybody can afford?
[16:01.090 --> 16:05.570]  And that's his whole mission is to bring fairness back to vaping.
[16:06.090 --> 16:07.170]  That's, you know, he just,
[16:07.530 --> 16:10.650]  he sees all these other companies out there that are charging between like a
[16:10.650 --> 16:15.090]  hundred and $350 for a handheld vaporizer
[16:15.570 --> 16:18.530]  when it's just, he, I mean, he calls it, you know,
[16:18.530 --> 16:22.770]  for lack of a better word, like greed. And it's very true. You know, it's just,
[16:23.850 --> 16:28.530]  um, it's what it is, but yeah. So it's very, uh,
[16:29.330 --> 16:32.290]  it's a very cool start to something and it's a really great movement.
[16:32.290 --> 16:36.970]  So the vibe revolution is just that it's bringing fairness back to, um,
[16:37.490 --> 16:41.690]  to the consumer. So these vaporizers, um,
[16:41.850 --> 16:46.970]  will be available to the, um, to be bought in store one time.
[16:47.650 --> 16:51.450]  That'll be at the 420 launch at positive vibes. Um,
[16:51.530 --> 16:56.210]  and that's where 350 of the first 400 are going to
[16:56.210 --> 16:59.250]  be, um, are going to be sold.
[17:01.450 --> 17:02.570]  I did dab. Sorry.
[17:03.850 --> 17:06.770]  You just cracked me up. You were talking. I took advantage of the time.
[17:08.330 --> 17:09.490]  You're cracking me up, put it above.
[17:12.250 --> 17:15.010]  Um, but yeah, so, um,
[17:15.050 --> 17:18.490]  positive vibes is going to be the only time it's going to ever be quote unquote
[17:18.490 --> 17:19.370]  sold in a store.
[17:19.690 --> 17:23.010]  The way that they're going to keep it affordable to everybody is it's going to
[17:23.050 --> 17:25.930]  be sold through the website. Um,
[17:25.970 --> 17:28.530]  it's going to be sold on vi vaporizer.com.
[17:28.570 --> 17:33.490]  Will you spell that for folks? Yeah. V I E V A P O R I C.
[17:34.130 --> 17:38.210]  I just, I just needed to buy. Good job. You looked fucking nervous when I said,
[17:40.050 --> 17:43.330]  only because you troll me so hard all the time that I was like, damn,
[17:43.330 --> 17:45.290]  if I really mess up one word in this and you're like,
[17:47.970 --> 17:49.970]  I feel like you have a buzzer somewhere ready for that. Like
[17:50.570 --> 17:53.530]  all these ideas on the neck. When I get, when I get a studio,
[17:53.530 --> 17:56.370]  when I go Joe Rogan style and get a studio, there will be dropped down.
[17:56.610 --> 17:59.330]  The announcer, Mike, the Michael buffer, Mike, there'd be a buzzer.
[17:59.770 --> 18:00.690]  There'd be a trap door.
[18:02.770 --> 18:05.090]  I just imagine if you're talking to that microphone or you just started fucking
[18:05.090 --> 18:08.090]  rambling and I just hit a button and he fell right through the floor.
[18:08.770 --> 18:10.530]  And ladies and gentlemen, back to the show.
[18:13.810 --> 18:15.410]  Oh, that would be awesome.
[18:16.050 --> 18:17.050]  Act like nothing happened.
[18:19.970 --> 18:21.010]  She's in the Gator pit. Don't worry.
[18:24.890 --> 18:26.210]  Splash and she's gone.
[18:28.810 --> 18:31.810]  All right. I cut you off in the middle of a beautiful sales pitch.
[18:31.810 --> 18:33.490]  You were doing such a good job. Uh,
[18:33.530 --> 18:35.650]  vi vaporizer.com is where they can get it.
[18:35.850 --> 18:40.170]  They're only going to be 300 available on the website. Three, there's 400,
[18:40.170 --> 18:42.810]  350 of them. There'll be three on the website, right?
[18:42.850 --> 18:46.290]  No, there's only going to be 350 available in the store on launch day.
[18:46.330 --> 18:49.890]  Okay. I tried to do the math. I didn't remember what we got so far from that.
[18:49.890 --> 18:51.530]  It's okay. When is the launch day?
[18:51.650 --> 18:55.530]  The launch day is four 20 at positive. Yeah.
[18:55.570 --> 18:58.930]  You mean the stoner Christmas? Yeah. Where is positive vibes?
[18:58.970 --> 19:03.530]  Positive vibes. I'm actually going to pull up the address for you right here.
[19:03.930 --> 19:06.210]  Tell everybody how and where so that they can be there.
[19:06.250 --> 19:08.730]  So positive vibes is at three,
[19:08.730 --> 19:12.930]  three nine eight South Broadway in Inglewood, Colorado.
[19:13.250 --> 19:17.090]  And guys, the first 50 people that get to this event,
[19:17.090 --> 19:19.290]  get a free vibe vaporizer.
[19:19.850 --> 19:21.970]  Free FR double E y'all.
[19:22.170 --> 19:24.650]  The second, um, excuse me,
[19:24.650 --> 19:29.650]  the second 50 people that get there will get this vibe vaporizer for 50% off,
[19:29.890 --> 19:31.530]  which is $25.
[19:32.450 --> 19:33.850]  A $25 vaporizer.
[19:34.050 --> 19:39.010]  Yeah. Cause this, so the vaporizer only costs $50, 49.
[19:40.050 --> 19:42.530]  That's it's well worth it. Does it, how many of those, uh,
[19:42.730 --> 19:43.850]  cartridges does it come with?
[19:44.090 --> 19:47.650]  It comes with two flower ones and one wax one.
[19:47.650 --> 19:50.850]  Nice. And you said that those are reusable or
[19:51.290 --> 19:54.330]  they're reusable or they're cheap enough that like if you wanted to,
[19:55.050 --> 19:58.450]  so the way that the capsules work is you can pre pack them before you go out.
[19:58.450 --> 20:00.290]  So if you want to go to concerts and stuff like that,
[20:00.290 --> 20:04.090]  you can just take them and you can honestly let them hit the ground because
[20:04.090 --> 20:06.930]  they're the, um, the stainless steel ones, when they come out,
[20:06.930 --> 20:11.170]  they're hot to the touch, obviously, cause it's in an oven. But, um,
[20:11.530 --> 20:14.730]  you can honestly just let them hit the ground and walk away from them and it
[20:14.730 --> 20:17.970]  won't even matter because they're going to be so cheap to replace that.
[20:18.090 --> 20:19.170]  It doesn't even matter.
[20:19.290 --> 20:22.610]  Just like a spent shell casing. Exactly. See ya.
[20:23.010 --> 20:24.970]  See, that's funny. They wanted to, we talked,
[20:24.970 --> 20:27.650]  kept calling them bullets and we're like, we got to stop calling them that.
[20:29.170 --> 20:31.490]  We need to change that right away. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:31.570 --> 20:33.770]  That's not the right word for this industry. Yeah.
[20:33.850 --> 20:37.010]  I've got to dab a cactus cooler if you would like it. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:37.010 --> 20:39.690]  You're going to, you're going to like that. There's, there's more to also for,
[20:40.050 --> 20:44.050]  for you. Yeah. Yeah. That shout out to the barefoot grower, the barefoot extractor.
[20:44.650 --> 20:46.890]  Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll, that stuff tastes good, bro.
[20:46.970 --> 20:49.570]  I'm going to be heartbroken when I run out of this cactus cooler.
[20:51.130 --> 20:53.610]  It's going to have to grow more. I'm going to have to grow more.
[20:54.770 --> 20:57.530]  All right, Lindsay, where were we when we rudely cut you off on this,
[20:57.770 --> 21:02.130]  this product description website? Uh, you can get them, uh,
[21:02.170 --> 21:04.410]  the first 50 people at the event, get them for free. Yeah.
[21:04.490 --> 21:06.730]  You don't have to show up. What does it cost to get into the event?
[21:06.770 --> 21:08.970]  Nothing. You're going to show up and have one of those. Yeah.
[21:09.370 --> 21:13.490]  Go to the fucking event. You guys 50 people go and make sure you mentioned to
[21:13.490 --> 21:15.730]  somebody that you heard about it from the grow from your heart podcast.
[21:16.450 --> 21:18.850]  It'd be like, Hey, thanks. I heard that if I came here and got this vaporizer,
[21:19.250 --> 21:21.450]  the growth from the heart podcast told me if I came here,
[21:21.450 --> 21:24.690]  I could get her from running in door and be like, grow from your heart podcast.
[21:25.010 --> 21:26.610]  Just shout it out. The second you walk into the door,
[21:26.690 --> 21:29.570]  that's what everyone else who listens to the podcast does when they meet someone.
[21:30.090 --> 21:32.850]  They kind of do that. It's really funny. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, podcast,
[21:32.850 --> 21:36.410]  grow from your heart. Hey, Hey guys, we want to meet you.
[21:36.410 --> 21:40.330]  We're not going to run away. Just say, Hey, we're cool.
[21:40.330 --> 21:44.290]  We want to be your friends. It kind of, I said this on a recent episode. Uh,
[21:44.490 --> 21:47.690]  it drives me crazy when I get messages on Twitter and they're like,
[21:47.770 --> 21:50.930]  or Instagram or whatever, like, Hey bro, I saw you at this event. I didn't say,
[21:50.930 --> 21:55.330]  hi. Like, well, what the fuck? Saw you too. Didn't say hi. Like what?
[21:55.570 --> 21:58.410]  Didn't know who you were. Come say hello. You guys, we want to be your friends.
[21:58.410 --> 22:00.850]  We want to hang out. We want to shake your hands. We want to dab you out.
[22:00.850 --> 22:03.330]  We want to, we kind of want to take your dabs on a suit.
[22:03.330 --> 22:05.330]  It looks like first a lot of times I want to take your dad.
[22:05.330 --> 22:06.850]  Sometimes I don't, Hey, I'll admit it.
[22:06.850 --> 22:09.410]  Some people have tried to offer me dads or I'm like, fuck, I got a dad.
[22:10.530 --> 22:13.930]  That's when you go super low temp and you don't inhale. No, you know what I do?
[22:14.170 --> 22:18.010]  I'm just being polite. I flipped the script. I offer them a dab of mine.
[22:18.050 --> 22:19.810]  I'm like, no, no. Look at all the hash I've got, bro.
[22:19.850 --> 22:22.410]  Do you want to try some of this? And I act like mine's special.
[22:22.610 --> 22:25.850]  Even it is because it's purged and there's, if there's just looks,
[22:26.330 --> 22:28.810]  if it doesn't look purged or whatever, but thank you.
[22:29.090 --> 22:32.610]  Did you just turn the vibe back on? This got weird. The vine. Okay.
[22:33.050 --> 22:35.930]  All right. What'd you just call me? Here, I'm going to give you a dab.
[22:35.930 --> 22:37.570]  This cactus school. You've got a hot red.
[22:39.050 --> 22:41.450]  You should throw a wax capsule in there for Jeff.
[22:42.570 --> 22:46.530]  He has yet to actually try the wax. I like it with the flower that it tastes.
[22:46.530 --> 22:48.570]  Really good. You should do that. You have one right in front of you.
[22:48.810 --> 22:52.730]  There you go. But you have a little wax caps. Wow. That's kind of awkward.
[22:52.890 --> 22:54.810]  Lindsay's taking a dab in the middle of her product.
[22:56.490 --> 22:59.210]  Yeah. Hot, stupid, hot, red.
[22:59.210 --> 23:00.890]  Excuse me. Like cough for the next five minutes.
[23:00.890 --> 23:02.010]  Red means go in our world.
[23:02.010 --> 23:05.290]  I'll turn this mic up real loud so we can hear every wheeze that comes out of
[23:05.290 --> 23:06.930]  you, man.
[23:07.050 --> 23:10.490]  That was just Jevil pause the podcast for a lot of shit.
[23:10.490 --> 23:12.610]  Not for Lindsay dying from a hot dab though.
[23:12.650 --> 23:15.370]  I don't pause it for Mike dying anymore either. So don't, don't feel special.
[23:15.930 --> 23:16.770]  Don't be flattered.
[23:18.890 --> 23:22.050]  Hey Chris, I hear you got an event coming up on four 15. Yes, you do.
[23:22.170 --> 23:26.330]  It does. It does. With the new lovely dispensary I work with.
[23:26.450 --> 23:29.930]  Where did that be? The chronic boutique, the chronic boutique.
[23:29.930 --> 23:34.250]  Is that in Springs? It is. So that's a medical facility only. It is.
[23:35.290 --> 23:39.210]  Uh, are you nice to people? Yeah. Yeah. Go see Chris. He'll be nice to people.
[23:39.570 --> 23:43.130]  I try to be walking and yell, grow from your heart. Yes, please do.
[23:43.130 --> 23:45.570]  Actually do it like your bad. Make my day. Smile.
[23:47.970 --> 23:51.490]  Yeah. Smiled. You'll grow from your heart. And then you still Terps like every
[23:51.850 --> 23:55.170]  count to 17 and you'll Terps. And then it's got to 17 in your head.
[23:55.170 --> 23:57.690]  And you'll Terps all over again. No matter what Chris is doing,
[23:58.050 --> 23:59.930]  he's trying to help you. If he's trying to check your ID,
[24:00.130 --> 24:02.290]  just just bug this shit out of him for me.
[24:03.330 --> 24:06.570]  You definitely want to come down April 15th. Uh, we'll do it in a huge, uh,
[24:06.850 --> 24:10.410]  grand opening for our downtown location off of East Pike's peak.
[24:11.130 --> 24:13.770]  We'll have a whole bunch of vendors and a whole bunch of live, uh,
[24:13.890 --> 24:15.890]  entertainment. It's going to be sweet. Chris will be there.
[24:15.930 --> 24:19.250]  The traveling stoner will be there. I cannot, uh,
[24:19.690 --> 24:23.250]  commit to being there. I do know that I'll be at the dude grows cup that day.
[24:24.290 --> 24:25.250]  We'll be there that night too.
[24:25.570 --> 24:28.250]  Nice. It kind of depends on how traffic and my day goes,
[24:28.370 --> 24:31.010]  how my Friday goes to tell you the truth. But, uh, yes,
[24:31.010 --> 24:33.770]  I will be at the dude grows cup. So I look forward to seeing you guys there.
[24:34.170 --> 24:36.050]  Granny, when you listen to this, uh,
[24:36.090 --> 24:38.890]  contact somebody cause it sounds like you may need transportation.
[24:38.890 --> 24:41.970]  And we got to figure all that out for you. You got her already. Oh, okay.
[24:42.010 --> 24:43.370]  Well I was going to, Oh shit.
[24:43.690 --> 24:46.850]  She's going to be with us at the chronic boutique. Yeah. Problem solved.
[24:47.930 --> 24:51.850]  Granny's got a ride. Mike, granny calls us her chauffeurs. Nice. Mike,
[24:51.850 --> 24:53.730]  when you hear this, hit me up. We got to figure out if you're going,
[24:53.810 --> 24:55.690]  you've got a ticket. Uh,
[24:55.730 --> 24:58.050]  we just got to figure out if you're going or not and how you're getting there
[24:58.050 --> 25:03.010]  and whatnot. Mike, text me, Mike, we got to get you out of the house,
[25:03.010 --> 25:04.970]  buddy. It'd be fun to take you to a cannabis event.
[25:05.010 --> 25:06.850]  Go get you high out of your mind and take you home.
[25:06.930 --> 25:09.410]  I'm going to get a random text message from Mike. This is what's up.
[25:09.410 --> 25:12.930]  And I'm like, why is Mike texting me? Cause Lindsay said on the podcast,
[25:12.970 --> 25:16.010]  Mike text me like three in the morning. Cause he's a night owl.
[25:16.010 --> 25:19.530]  And he listens to shit when his kid goes to bed. Yup. Yup. He will text you too.
[25:19.530 --> 25:21.130]  What's up, Mike? You can text us at three in the morning.
[25:21.130 --> 25:22.930]  If that's what you got to do. We haven't heard from you in a minute, bro.
[25:23.650 --> 25:26.170]  Everybody. He did make it back from Mexico. Oh, okay.
[25:26.170 --> 25:28.730]  We did talk a little while ago about Mike going to Mexico.
[25:28.730 --> 25:31.610]  The last time I saw him was sitting at this table and he went to Mexico.
[25:31.610 --> 25:34.570]  He did survive. He got married back. The kid came back.
[25:34.850 --> 25:37.570]  It's all good. Came back to, okay. Those are the two important things.
[25:37.570 --> 25:39.970]  Yes. The one, the wife too. Okay. Three. There you go.
[25:41.010 --> 25:43.650]  I even think the person they took to babysit the kid made it back.
[25:45.170 --> 25:48.570]  They didn't trade any of the humans for whatever you could trade humans for in
[25:48.610 --> 25:53.370]  Mexico. Damn. Really missed out on that one guys.
[25:53.370 --> 25:57.770]  We really derailed this podcast quickly. Just took a couple of dabs. Oh man.
[25:58.050 --> 26:00.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're smoking with us. I hope you're smiling.
[26:00.210 --> 26:02.690]  I hope you got a big old smile on your face. Hope you're laughing at us.
[26:02.930 --> 26:05.730]  Cause we're, we're kind of dabbed out over here. We're being goofy. It's fun.
[26:05.970 --> 26:06.850]  I just hanging out with some friends.
[26:06.850 --> 26:08.970]  It doesn't always have to be uptight podcast mode.
[26:08.970 --> 26:11.770]  I like it when we get high and ramble a little bit. I do too.
[26:12.170 --> 26:14.650]  Chris and Lindsay are speaking their sign language to each other.
[26:14.810 --> 26:16.410]  They can read each other's minds a little bit,
[26:16.410 --> 26:19.450]  unless you ask for the torch or a Q-tip or a can of butane.
[26:19.490 --> 26:21.970]  And then they're all fucking confused. They just grab all of you.
[26:21.970 --> 26:24.770]  Which one do you want? Cause I can't figure it out.
[26:26.090 --> 26:26.930]  Start throwing everything at each other.
[26:26.930 --> 26:30.850]  I was going to say, start throwing shit. I can't read your mind. Which one?
[26:31.850 --> 26:32.770]  Oh man.
[26:33.250 --> 26:38.250]  So, uh, the address is on 33. Oh, you already put your phone away.
[26:38.250 --> 26:39.090]  No, 3398.
[26:39.690 --> 26:43.330]  3398 South Broadway in Inglewood. Yeah. All right.
[26:44.010 --> 26:46.570]  What time is that even going to start?
[26:46.650 --> 26:50.050]  It's going to start at 10 AM and it will end at 4 PM.
[26:50.890 --> 26:54.730]  Perfect timing. That's perfect. Awesome. There's other stuff to do.
[26:54.930 --> 26:58.570]  Exactly. And your event on four 15. What time does that one start?
[26:58.890 --> 27:02.130]  Two to five, two to five. Everything's going to work out.
[27:02.130 --> 27:05.490]  It's going to be a great four 20 season. It is going to be an awesome time.
[27:05.490 --> 27:07.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what's going on without the cannabis cup in
[27:07.970 --> 27:10.450]  Colorado. Everybody used to just come for the high times cannabis cup.
[27:10.450 --> 27:13.410]  So if you're coming to Colorado for four 20 and you want to hang out,
[27:13.450 --> 27:16.650]  send us some Twitter messages and we'll try to get together and dab with people
[27:16.650 --> 27:19.730]  because it's going to be a weird four 20 without a cannabis cup.
[27:19.730 --> 27:23.010]  There's still a rally in Denver. And of course four 20 is on Thursday, I think.
[27:23.010 --> 27:25.770]  Yeah. So 22 is that elevate party? Yes.
[27:25.770 --> 27:28.290]  Four 22 shots to our friends at elevate. Good elevate.
[27:28.450 --> 27:31.970]  Everything is radic cheap. It'll be a good time. It'll be crowded.
[27:33.370 --> 27:35.530]  Radic cheap. Radic cheap. Yes.
[27:35.570 --> 27:37.610]  They're going to have a huge sale on everything at elevate.
[27:37.610 --> 27:40.010]  I've got a flyer in my phone. They sent me an email.
[27:40.210 --> 27:42.570]  It's going to be a good old grand old time. Make sure you check out elevate.
[27:42.570 --> 27:45.690]  There's going to be a party in the backyard with a bunch of bunch of bands.
[27:46.050 --> 27:49.050]  Lindsay will be there. We try to get to as much of the stuff as we can.
[27:49.290 --> 27:53.410]  It looks like it is my turn to hit the Vi. It is flashing. Do I hit it? Nope.
[27:54.530 --> 27:57.690]  Don't hit it. I already did though. Oh, it vibrated. Now hold it and hit it.
[28:05.810 --> 28:08.690]  I was just thinking that I was hoping they could hear me drop through it.
[28:10.010 --> 28:11.050]  I got a lot of smoke.
[28:11.450 --> 28:14.930]  I got a lot of vapor. It was my lungs felt full, but there was not a lot of smoke.
[28:14.970 --> 28:16.610]  That tastes really good. What did I just smoke?
[28:17.610 --> 28:19.090]  What did you pack those wax capsules with?
[28:21.930 --> 28:26.370]  Some dabble extracts. It looks like it's bango. It's banana mango, banana mango.
[28:26.370 --> 28:29.970]  Yeah, I'll give it that. There's banana mango turps in there. Turps.
[28:30.130 --> 28:32.130]  That is delicious. I approve.
[28:33.570 --> 28:36.850]  What is it set at temperature wise? If I push the second bump? Oh yeah.
[28:36.850 --> 28:39.450]  If you went to the third bump, you would get a gnarly, gnarly,
[28:39.490 --> 28:42.690]  rip out of this thing. The second bump, I don't want to say it a bump.
[28:42.690 --> 28:44.690]  The second light, uh, was effective,
[28:44.690 --> 28:47.650]  but that third one would be more of my style and I feel like I'd just roast that
[28:47.650 --> 28:51.690]  capsule in like two rips, but yeah, I like that. Yeah.
[28:51.930 --> 28:56.490]  It's much more polite on my lungs than a dab rig. That is certainly true.
[28:57.330 --> 29:01.730]  It doesn't feel like I just got punched in the chest, which I sometimes I enjoy,
[29:01.730 --> 29:06.730]  but that's going to do really well for times when I need quicker
[29:06.730 --> 29:11.730]  medication and I can't use a torch and such. Yeah, absolutely.
[29:11.730 --> 29:15.090]  Who knows when those times and places may be, but they, but they will be soon.
[29:15.090 --> 29:15.930]  I'm sure.
[29:18.130 --> 29:22.210]  Um, honestly I really like this product. I sat on,
[29:22.450 --> 29:27.450]  maybe I'm a little biased because I helped develop it. So I really like it,
[29:27.450 --> 29:32.450]  but I just really feel like it's a really easy to use vaporizer.
[29:32.610 --> 29:34.370]  The thing you're doing right now, unscrewing the bottom,
[29:34.410 --> 29:36.690]  the thing you're doing right now and screwing the bottom and then it comes with
[29:36.690 --> 29:38.570]  that tool where you can push everything right through it.
[29:38.810 --> 29:41.810]  That's a really cool idea. I've never seen that as a possibility on a vape pan.
[29:41.810 --> 29:45.170]  Usually once they clog up there, they're fucked. Like I've ruined several.
[29:45.490 --> 29:48.010]  You can put alcohol through that and everything.
[29:48.650 --> 29:52.290]  You can dip Q-tips in alcohol and go through there. It's all safe.
[29:52.770 --> 29:54.610]  That's why it comes with these little brushes.
[29:55.010 --> 29:56.570]  It comes with such a good cleaning kit.
[29:58.450 --> 30:02.290]  What Jeff was referring to was, um, okay, so on, on this device,
[30:02.650 --> 30:04.690]  not hot if you want to play with mine cause yours is going to burn you.
[30:05.450 --> 30:08.130]  We saw that earlier. You guys, we were just using it.
[30:08.130 --> 30:11.730]  Lindsay needs adult supervision sometimes. Always, always. And a helmet.
[30:12.850 --> 30:16.930]  So if you press on the, um, the side of the mouthpiece on the top, um,
[30:16.970 --> 30:21.770]  you will actually be able to pop it off and inside of it comes,
[30:23.050 --> 30:28.050]  um, one of the little tiny metal dab tools that like comes in every single
[30:29.050 --> 30:30.370]  anything ever.
[30:30.410 --> 30:34.210]  That's connected to a small silicone mouthpiece that's inside the mouthpiece
[30:34.570 --> 30:35.530]  cool down smoke.
[30:35.650 --> 30:40.250]  Yeah. So it's, it's in there to basically like absorb the heat. Um,
[30:40.250 --> 30:45.250]  but it goes into the, um, the tunnel that goes into the chamber,
[30:45.770 --> 30:47.370]  um, that holds the capsule.
[30:47.570 --> 30:52.570]  And when you unscrew the bottom and you take the capsule out and there is a
[30:53.170 --> 30:57.450]  little, um, dab tool that comes with the, uh,
[30:57.450 --> 31:00.850]  with the Vi it's it comes inside the parts.
[31:00.850 --> 31:02.690]  It's the thicker silver one.
[31:03.050 --> 31:07.730]  It actually fits through that hole in the top of the mouthpiece and it goes
[31:07.730 --> 31:09.930]  through there and through the chamber.
[31:09.930 --> 31:14.450]  So if a capsule ever gets a little too snug in there or if
[31:14.450 --> 31:18.370]  Sticky from hash, exactly. That's what I see happening. Yeah, absolutely.
[31:18.370 --> 31:21.770]  If, if you put one of the wax capsules in there and it maybe leaves a little
[31:22.290 --> 31:25.890]  clean out your piece and you just keep using it for often,
[31:26.010 --> 31:30.570]  it'll get stuck in there. Absolutely. Or if you're using the direct load mode,
[31:30.590 --> 31:33.970]  which I'll, I'll talk about all the modes in a second, I guess. But, um,
[31:34.250 --> 31:35.490]  you can like push through,
[31:35.490 --> 31:38.370]  you can like push the screen out and everything and it'll be it.
[31:38.610 --> 31:43.330]  It nothing will get stuck and everything is super easy to clean and no issues.
[31:43.330 --> 31:46.530]  You can literally run alcohol through it. No problems.
[31:46.650 --> 31:48.930]  That's pretty rad. I'm going to ask you a random question.
[31:48.930 --> 31:52.810]  So let's talk about the three load modes before I forget my question. Sure.
[31:54.050 --> 31:58.050]  Um, so the three different load modes are red is capsules,
[31:58.050 --> 32:01.610]  which are these little stainless steel capsules that we were talking about that
[32:01.610 --> 32:04.290]  you preload and you can put into the chamber.
[32:04.810 --> 32:09.130]  Blue is the direct mode where you throw a screen, um,
[32:09.170 --> 32:13.570]  into the, um, bottom of the chain, I guess it's technically the top.
[32:14.210 --> 32:17.490]  Yeah. If you throw it into the bottom of it and then you,
[32:17.490 --> 32:22.210]  you can pack herb on top of that and you can also use the little capsule holder
[32:22.210 --> 32:26.410]  to put herb in it or underneath. Oh Jesus.
[32:26.570 --> 32:29.770]  I'm man. I've been hanging out with granny too much. I'm fucking knocking shit.
[32:29.770 --> 32:31.770]  Oh, I'm sorry. Granny likes to knock shit over. Yeah,
[32:31.770 --> 32:35.290]  that was a lot of cursing people that aren't aware of granny is like the queen
[32:35.290 --> 32:39.290]  of knocking shit over a glass is dangerous around granny. She likes to,
[32:39.290 --> 32:41.650]  she's clumsy. I love her, but I have to tell the story.
[32:41.650 --> 32:45.170]  So yesterday we were walking out of Canada Canyon and she threw the back door
[32:45.410 --> 32:50.050]  so hard that I honestly thought she broke that plastic cabinet that was there.
[32:50.570 --> 32:53.370]  And I was like, Gail, that was really hard. And she was like,
[32:53.530 --> 32:56.010]  she turns around and looks at everybody in the club and she was just like,
[32:56.250 --> 33:01.050]  God's a granny. And everyone just started laughing. And I'm like, Oh my God,
[33:01.050 --> 33:05.010]  she really almost broke that. I don't know. It's funny. I love you. But like,
[33:05.290 --> 33:07.010]  that was, and she, and then we're walking out and she's like,
[33:07.370 --> 33:09.330]  I think she said her dad used to say all the time,
[33:09.370 --> 33:11.850]  or Kevin says all the time that she doesn't know her own strength.
[33:12.050 --> 33:15.450]  She really doesn't. She's like crazy.
[33:15.730 --> 33:18.330]  Granny, I miss you and I love you. And I can't wait to see you soon.
[33:18.730 --> 33:20.810]  It sounds like I'll see you Saturday.
[33:21.650 --> 33:24.730]  So there's little funnels in the bottom underneath like,
[33:24.730 --> 33:28.570]  Oh look how fucking convenient that is. They thought of everything for us.
[33:28.610 --> 33:31.610]  So you can actually, this is, this works for two different things.
[33:31.610 --> 33:34.010]  It works for packing the capsules cause it fits into those.
[33:34.810 --> 33:37.330]  And it also works for the direct mode as well.
[33:37.330 --> 33:39.250]  That's pretty fresh. And can you fill the little,
[33:39.730 --> 33:43.610]  the little cylinders with that also? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Multi-use.
[33:43.610 --> 33:46.530]  See I'm learning. Absolutely. You guys are going to love this product.
[33:46.770 --> 33:49.370]  Not only is it cool to smoke with, but it's fun to play with.
[33:49.370 --> 33:51.170]  It's got so many modes and lights and buttons.
[33:51.330 --> 33:53.650]  You can just hang out and play with it for a couple hours when you get it.
[33:53.650 --> 33:56.970]  Really it then it vibrates and it lets you know when it's hot by vibrating.
[33:56.970 --> 34:01.130]  So it's got a standby mode. So if it like, it'll like keep the chamber,
[34:01.130 --> 34:05.930]  quote unquote warm, but not ready to use. So it won't burn your, yeah,
[34:06.250 --> 34:09.130]  this is pretty rad. Yeah, for sure. It's a really, really good place.
[34:09.850 --> 34:13.010]  So, um, so then the, so that's the, um,
[34:13.050 --> 34:17.210]  direct mode is blue and then purple is the concentrates for the,
[34:17.210 --> 34:19.530]  and it has these little wax capsules. Okay.
[34:19.610 --> 34:22.810]  The wax capsules have a little heating stone inside.
[34:23.530 --> 34:26.810]  Can't get this one open. Oh, right. It has wax in it through. It's all sticky.
[34:26.850 --> 34:30.650]  Yeah. So, um, it has, I was going to pull the heating stone out.
[34:31.010 --> 34:33.370]  It's like a, uh, if you guys have ever used a health stone pipe,
[34:33.410 --> 34:37.490]  it's like a very small version of that. Kind of looks like, um, uh, man,
[34:37.530 --> 34:40.610]  it's almost like a piece of ceramic kind of, but it's got more,
[34:40.610 --> 34:43.250]  it's more porous. So it will hold heat. Uh,
[34:43.250 --> 34:45.970]  and it kind of sits inside this little, what are those made of?
[34:45.970 --> 34:48.890]  Are those aluminum? Um, they're stainless steel, stainless steel.
[34:48.890 --> 34:53.770]  It's inside of a little stainless steel capsule. That's honestly the size of like
[34:53.810 --> 34:56.090]  a, it's like the shell casing, honestly,
[34:56.090 --> 35:00.730]  like a small caliber shell casing is what it looks like to me. Yeah.
[35:01.410 --> 35:02.530]  Let's not get too specific,
[35:02.610 --> 35:06.850]  but it kind of looks like a nine millimeter shell casing and you just load them
[35:06.850 --> 35:09.050]  up with wax and you put them right in the bottom there. You screw that on,
[35:09.930 --> 35:11.330]  click it three times to turn it on.
[35:11.330 --> 35:14.010]  You make sure it's on the right mode and then you hold the button.
[35:14.290 --> 35:16.170]  So the way to change the mode, um,
[35:16.210 --> 35:18.330]  so the temperature settings are on the bottom.
[35:18.570 --> 35:21.770]  So you can change the temperature setting just by pressing that button on the
[35:21.770 --> 35:26.090]  bottom. One time it goes from, yeah, there's four different heat settings.
[35:26.290 --> 35:28.170]  There are numerical, um,
[35:28.210 --> 35:31.410]  numbers to this and you can check in the, um,
[35:31.450 --> 35:33.850]  starter's guide for the actual, like if,
[35:33.970 --> 35:36.850]  if you want to know the actual numerical numbers for what each one is,
[35:37.170 --> 35:38.890]  it's in there. But, um,
[35:39.170 --> 35:41.650]  so in order to change it between the different modes,
[35:41.650 --> 35:45.970]  you hold the temp button on the bottom of the device and then you can actually
[35:45.970 --> 35:48.450]  click through the different, uh,
[35:48.450 --> 35:53.250]  you can actually click through the different colors. So blue, red,
[35:54.370 --> 35:57.130]  and then it knows if you're using a wax container, an herb container,
[35:57.130 --> 35:58.250]  or if you're just raw dog in it.
[35:59.290 --> 36:03.730]  Absolutely. That's, that's what it's supposed to do. So
[36:04.730 --> 36:05.570]  um,
[36:05.730 --> 36:09.210]  and it's nice cause that thing actually has more than four heat settings because
[36:09.210 --> 36:14.010]  since it has three modes, each mode has its own technical setting.
[36:14.130 --> 36:14.690]  All right.
[36:14.690 --> 36:18.730]  So you can technically get really crazy with it and find your own personal
[36:18.730 --> 36:22.170]  liking. And you might be like, well, I don't like the direct mode, right?
[36:22.330 --> 36:23.330]  With the capsule.
[36:23.490 --> 36:26.490]  But you could put it on direct mode, turn it up high, put a capsule in,
[36:26.490 --> 36:29.490]  or you could, you could play with it. Okay. You can get real crazy.
[36:29.490 --> 36:31.210]  So there's really like 30.
[36:31.530 --> 36:34.570]  So you really, it's really a person. That's a crazy math equation, right?
[36:35.490 --> 36:38.810]  Three times four times the amount of settings.
[36:40.530 --> 36:44.050]  Okay. I'm already lost. I was never good at probability in high school.
[36:44.890 --> 36:46.570]  I didn't even know what the name of the fucking class was.
[36:46.570 --> 36:47.530]  So you got further than me.
[36:48.530 --> 36:52.770]  Probability is not a class. It's just a subject. Like it's probably what,
[36:52.810 --> 36:55.970]  Oh my God, man. Maybe I was ahead.
[36:56.010 --> 36:57.930]  The probability of me showing up for that.
[36:57.930 --> 36:59.890]  Cause I know that that's statistics class.
[37:04.330 --> 37:06.850]  And I think it's just cause I didn't go to a fun school.
[37:07.450 --> 37:09.930]  I'm a good student when the schooling is right. All right.
[37:10.650 --> 37:13.290]  I had a question that I wanted to ask you. Is this your first focus group?
[37:13.810 --> 37:14.490]  Yes.
[37:14.490 --> 37:15.930]  What do you think about the focus group thing?
[37:15.930 --> 37:17.330]  Cause it seems like you're going to do it a lot.
[37:17.650 --> 37:19.330]  Um, you know what?
[37:20.050 --> 37:24.490]  I was very happy with how receptive they were to our
[37:24.490 --> 37:26.370]  ideas and to our input.
[37:26.570 --> 37:27.090]  Nice.
[37:27.090 --> 37:30.570]  I feel like there was not one thing that I,
[37:31.850 --> 37:36.610]  I hope Brock hears this and like listens to this. He calls this the Lindsay,
[37:36.930 --> 37:39.090]  the Lindsay maze. Yeah. The Lindsay maze.
[37:39.370 --> 37:43.410]  Because I would, we, I would make Chris do it first. And I,
[37:43.450 --> 37:45.490]  cause they would like, it would get so hot, Jeff,
[37:45.490 --> 37:48.090]  that it would burn your mouth. The first couple of ones that he brought to me.
[37:48.090 --> 37:49.530]  We're figuring out the heat settings.
[37:49.530 --> 37:53.050]  The first couple of like hits were a little hot on the first,
[37:53.050 --> 37:55.290]  like one or two hits hot as hell.
[37:55.330 --> 37:58.730]  I would make him do it. And if, if they made me do it first, I would be like,
[37:59.010 --> 38:00.570]  I would touch it like here first,
[38:00.570 --> 38:03.330]  but I would really like test it on my lip before,
[38:03.610 --> 38:06.810]  because it would get really hot, like blistering on. I was like, no way.
[38:07.330 --> 38:10.130]  So he calls that the Lindsay maze that Lindsay would complain so much.
[38:10.130 --> 38:12.850]  And Lindsay would make it such an issue that I had to fix it.
[38:13.090 --> 38:16.250]  So that, um, dab tool staying in there. So, I mean like,
[38:16.570 --> 38:18.370]  you don't have to keep it in there, but it just,
[38:19.530 --> 38:20.970]  piece of metal is going to suck up the heat.
[38:21.010 --> 38:23.610]  It cools down the vapor, everything. It's really nice.
[38:24.010 --> 38:26.130]  My hands are all sweaty, so I can't get a damn open.
[38:26.810 --> 38:30.450]  That's why I was just there. It is nice. Yeah.
[38:30.450 --> 38:32.810]  It doesn't go anywhere, which is nice. Yeah. That's pretty smooth.
[38:33.130 --> 38:36.130]  And it sits nicely in there because a little piece of the rubber, the silicone,
[38:37.090 --> 38:40.050]  that just cools you down. So you don't fry yourself super smart.
[38:40.170 --> 38:44.890]  And it doesn't restrict the airflow at all. I like that. Genius. Genius, genius.
[38:44.890 --> 38:49.570]  What other products are you sitting on and developing? Nothing, nothing.
[38:50.570 --> 38:53.770]  Blank face. I love it. Your poker face sucks.
[38:56.130 --> 38:58.010]  I can't wait to hear about it. Whatever the next product is.
[38:58.690 --> 39:00.570]  I'll tell you when you start recording. Just kidding.
[39:00.570 --> 39:03.290]  Well, what the podcasters don't want to hear that shit.
[39:03.290 --> 39:05.530]  She's going to tell us when I stopped recording. So I'm going to reach over,
[39:06.130 --> 39:06.970]  press a stop.
[39:07.730 --> 39:10.930]  You'll stop for that, but you won't stop for me dying.
[39:10.970 --> 39:12.290]  No, I was lying. I was going to tell you,
[39:12.290 --> 39:14.610]  I stopped at not so that she told everybody that's all.
[39:14.690 --> 39:17.970]  I was going to lie to your face because we're friends and that's what we do.
[39:20.490 --> 39:23.450]  Okay. Good point.
[39:24.730 --> 39:28.090]  So thanks to Vi for this sweet tester.
[39:28.090 --> 39:31.930]  I've got number 248 of 400. I'm going to use the shit out of this.
[39:31.970 --> 39:33.570]  I'm going to let them know what I think.
[39:33.610 --> 39:38.210]  You will see this on my social media because it already fits well in my hand.
[39:38.210 --> 39:42.130]  I see it becoming a pacifier. This will shut me up at certain times.
[39:42.890 --> 39:44.730]  This is, I can't wait to see next week when Jeff's like,
[39:44.730 --> 39:47.890]  I put all my rigs away. And for some reason, all I do is dab out of the vibe.
[39:48.890 --> 39:52.610]  You see me posting just nothing but Instagram selfies of me in the Vi.
[39:52.610 --> 39:56.010]  Just I'm going to call it the Bay. It's my new Bay.
[39:56.450 --> 39:59.170]  Me and Bay out at the park. I hate that word so much.
[39:59.170 --> 39:59.570]  Not even,
[39:59.570 --> 40:02.770]  I can't wait for you guys to see all the posts of Jeff being like,
[40:03.010 --> 40:06.490]  Vi's making me smoke flower again. I love flower.
[40:06.490 --> 40:08.890]  It's really funny you say that because I almost ran over there and got some of
[40:08.890 --> 40:11.090]  that grateful dog flower out of that container to put in here.
[40:11.090 --> 40:13.930]  The look on your face when I said grateful flower, we can do that.
[40:13.970 --> 40:16.170]  We can do that. All right. Well, that's way over there.
[40:17.090 --> 40:20.330]  You guys are already finding capsules and grinders. Like let's get it on.
[40:20.770 --> 40:23.450]  We'll we'll do that. We'll put the weeds way over there. It's all good.
[40:23.450 --> 40:24.650]  It'll be. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:28.530 --> 40:30.570]  Lindsay's ready to cook at the damn weed right now.
[40:33.210 --> 40:35.250]  So I'm going to use this. I'm going to let everybody know what I think of it.
[40:36.050 --> 40:39.210]  I will give you guys on the podcast and update in like two or three episodes
[40:39.210 --> 40:42.730]  because it'll be in my hand and I will remember to do that. Lindsay,
[40:42.730 --> 40:45.570]  thanks for bringing me this. Shout out to you. You said his name was Barack.
[40:45.570 --> 40:48.410]  Yes. Shout out to Barack for letting me be a part of your testing team.
[40:48.410 --> 40:51.010]  I hope I do you good service.
[40:51.850 --> 40:54.250]  All right. You guys got anything else to talk about since we're hanging out
[40:54.250 --> 40:56.250]  on a podcast and at the table getting dabbed out?
[40:57.690 --> 41:01.890]  I would just tell you to come catch us at the 420 event at Positive Vibes for sure.
[41:01.890 --> 41:06.650]  Yes. And if you are able to figure out how to get to the Dude Grows Cup,
[41:06.650 --> 41:09.410]  which will be happening shortly after this episode comes out,
[41:09.410 --> 41:10.530]  I'm going to put this out.
[41:10.530 --> 41:13.210]  This might be like Wednesday or Friday because I've already got a Thursday
[41:13.250 --> 41:17.010]  episode scheduled. So, hey, if the numbers were out of order, I'm sorry.
[41:17.530 --> 41:20.690]  The numbers might be wrong. I might've done it like whatever backwards,
[41:20.690 --> 41:22.290]  but it's still going to happen. You guys don't know.
[41:22.290 --> 41:25.370]  But all the numbers are there. So that's what matters. Yes. Yes.
[41:25.370 --> 41:26.210]  If you put it all together,
[41:26.210 --> 41:30.010]  the puzzle has borders and it all adds up to picture looks great. Chris,
[41:30.010 --> 41:32.170]  have you made any more gnomes? I haven't.
[41:32.210 --> 41:35.250]  Dude, you got to make more of those gnomes, bro. Those gnomes are dope.
[41:35.250 --> 41:36.930]  Eventually once people have been going crazy.
[41:36.930 --> 41:41.090]  Once the chronic boutique, once we calm down with all the openings and all that
[41:41.090 --> 41:42.930]  stuff, I get back to my other side stuff.
[41:44.410 --> 41:47.370]  You got to get up on that torch, bro. Get up on the torch.
[41:49.010 --> 41:52.050]  I think this podcast is right about two years old. You guys,
[41:52.050 --> 41:54.210]  we've been on this podcast for two years.
[41:54.290 --> 41:56.690]  I'm not certain of the birth date of this show.
[41:56.690 --> 41:57.850]  I haven't done a lot of research,
[41:57.850 --> 42:02.650]  but right around four 20 ish is when this podcast started
[42:02.690 --> 42:06.410]  two years ago. So thanks everybody. This has been listening since the beginning.
[42:07.650 --> 42:10.050]  You think it's been three years? I think it's been three. Really?
[42:10.050 --> 42:12.090]  Cause we've almost been out here for almost two now.
[42:13.250 --> 42:16.290]  Well now you make me want to do research. I could probably do research.
[42:16.290 --> 42:17.930]  Somebody talk for a couple of seconds. Oh, you know what?
[42:17.930 --> 42:21.290]  I can't do it cause I don't want to fuck it up. Oh, you know what? I think,
[42:21.490 --> 42:24.890]  well, we've been out here for a year and four months cause it's April now.
[42:24.890 --> 42:27.170]  So two years would make sense then.
[42:28.530 --> 42:30.650]  And a hundred and 200 episodes would make sense to me.
[42:30.650 --> 42:35.370]  I feel like it's so much sometimes I do also cause I can't remember not doing it.
[42:35.650 --> 42:38.570]  If that makes any sense. I'm like, yeah, I've just been doing that forever.
[42:39.490 --> 42:41.290]  And it doesn't on the thing I'm looking for.
[42:41.290 --> 42:42.370]  It doesn't show me a date right now.
[42:43.730 --> 42:45.850]  For the first rec cup,
[42:47.570 --> 42:49.450]  you just started the podcast.
[42:49.490 --> 42:51.450]  You know, I could have looked on my phone for you, Jeff.
[42:51.850 --> 42:56.690]  The first episode is not in the feed, so you can't find episode number one.
[42:57.930 --> 42:58.850]  Yeah, I know that.
[43:01.210 --> 43:03.210]  But it's in my computer, so I will be able to look.
[43:03.930 --> 43:08.730]  Somebody like Fred Garvin or Kelvin Medina tweet me,
[43:08.890 --> 43:10.810]  let me know how long have we been doing this damn podcast.
[43:10.810 --> 43:13.330]  I know you guys are listening. Shout out to those guys that listen religiously.
[43:13.330 --> 43:16.650]  I appreciate you guys. That's really cool that I can say stuff.
[43:16.810 --> 43:19.850]  One time I asked a question on Facebook about the podcast. I was like,
[43:19.850 --> 43:23.210]  I can't find this episode. Somebody helped me. And I think it was Fred,
[43:24.210 --> 43:27.170]  messaged me within seconds. He's like, here's the answer, dude. I was like, damn,
[43:27.170 --> 43:30.370]  that's so rad that I can have helpers like that. It might not have been Fred.
[43:30.370 --> 43:32.410]  It might've been somebody else. I know who it was.
[43:33.410 --> 43:38.210]  Might've been a rich Gannon maybe. Yeah. Try to get those names, right?
[43:38.810 --> 43:41.290]  I don't know them personally, so they're just screen names.
[43:41.330 --> 43:42.930]  I try to keep all that stuff straight in my head.
[43:42.930 --> 43:45.090]  I went to get a message from him now. It was me.
[43:46.850 --> 43:48.970]  I'm kind of hoping so. So I love the interaction.
[43:48.970 --> 43:51.610]  If you guys want to message me, I've said it a million times on the podcast,
[43:51.610 --> 43:53.090]  but maybe you're new, a new listener,
[43:53.090 --> 43:57.250]  maybe seeing the traveling stoner post this made you listen. You can message me.
[43:57.250 --> 43:58.210]  You can send me a message.
[43:58.410 --> 44:01.090]  The email is grow from your heart at hotmail.com Twitter.

[44:16.410 --> 44:20.130]  It's a, she's playing with their phone right now. Is it the traveling stone?
[44:21.450 --> 44:24.410]  All right. On Instagram. She's got a website. I do.
[44:24.410 --> 44:27.690]  It's got a website. She finally did it. The traveling stoner.com. Check it out.
[44:27.690 --> 44:31.170]  It's a good website. It looks good. Thank you. Yeah. I, uh,
[44:31.770 --> 44:35.170]  I created all myself. So I'm, I'm very, very proud of it.
[44:36.210 --> 44:41.130]  Making a website to pain in the ass. It definitely tried me. I definitely,
[44:41.570 --> 44:45.770]  my website looks like shit and I don't have time to fix it.
[44:46.170 --> 44:50.410]  And I just say, sorry, it looks like shit, but guess what? The podcast works.
[44:50.890 --> 44:54.610]  That's what counts. That's where the focus has been lately. So that's what's
[44:55.330 --> 44:57.890]  happening. So you got the website up? Yeah, I've got the website up. Um,
[44:57.890 --> 44:59.330]  the YouTube channel should be up.
[44:59.930 --> 45:04.050]  I will definitely have it up by the end of the month for sure. Um,
[45:04.330 --> 45:07.850]  and I have a lot of things in the works right now. Actually.
[45:07.850 --> 45:11.810]  I have a shop opening in May on my website with, um,
[45:12.050 --> 45:15.970]  stickers, t-shirts, all that kind of stuff. Um,
[45:16.050 --> 45:21.050]  I have some guest writers coming up on the blog in the next couple of
[45:21.090 --> 45:21.810]  months.
[45:21.810 --> 45:25.090]  And I'm actually going to be guest writing for a couple of blogs in the next
[45:25.090 --> 45:29.770]  couple of months as well. Sounds like you got a lot going on. Yeah. And I'm,
[45:29.770 --> 45:33.450]  uh, yeah, just doing a lot of stuff. How many Instagram followers are you up to
[45:33.450 --> 45:38.170]  now? Um, I actually don't know off the top of my head, you know,
[45:38.210 --> 45:42.810]  I don't don't be that girl. I think I'm at 11.7 or eight.
[45:42.890 --> 45:46.970]  Nice. You're getting there. You're getting it, putting it in. Yeah, definitely.
[45:46.970 --> 45:51.210]  Nice. Yeah. Moving on up. I'm excited. You got the website going,
[45:51.250 --> 45:52.810]  but now I don't have anything to troll you over.
[45:53.210 --> 45:55.410]  Well, I still don't have the YouTube channel up so you can tell me about that.
[45:55.450 --> 45:56.850]  But you're going to do it. You've said it.
[45:56.850 --> 45:59.890]  If you can't do it by the first of next month, then I got to troll you.
[45:59.930 --> 46:03.090]  That's true. I bet you'll do it. Uh, the podcast has a YouTube channel.
[46:03.090 --> 46:06.370]  There are 25 videos that you can see.
[46:06.370 --> 46:08.810]  And there are a few more that you can't see. They're still private.
[46:09.090 --> 46:11.890]  Once I get 50 videos made and posted to YouTube,
[46:11.890 --> 46:16.810]  I will let all 50 of them be viewable because the viewers slash listeners are
[46:16.810 --> 46:20.770]  fucking savages. And the new trend is to binge watch everything.
[46:21.090 --> 46:23.250]  It's like, Oh, I'll just wait until he puts out a hundred episodes.
[46:23.250 --> 46:26.410]  And I'll stay up for four days and drink Dr. Pepper and smoke dabs and just
[46:26.410 --> 46:30.330]  listen to every fucking episode and then send him an email about every single one
[46:30.330 --> 46:33.490]  back to back. That's what people do now. It feels like, but I love it.
[46:33.490 --> 46:34.450]  Listen how you want to,
[46:34.690 --> 46:37.650]  but I've got to wait until I've got at least like 25 more to put out there.
[46:37.650 --> 46:39.690]  People are just going to eat them up and they're going to look at you like a
[46:39.690 --> 46:44.330]  hungry crocodile. Like where's the next one? I love it, but it's hard to keep up.
[46:44.610 --> 46:46.810]  I can only imagine. Yeah. Yeah. And I love it.
[46:46.810 --> 46:49.010]  I want to keep doing this podcast because I love putting it out there for
[46:49.010 --> 46:52.410]  people. But sometimes it is a challenge keeping the hungry mouths,
[46:52.410 --> 46:55.890]  the hungry wolves fed the hungry ears. I'm not Joe Rogan. You guys,
[46:58.370 --> 47:03.370]  Mr. Chris, yes. How can we stalk you on some social media at Bobo blaster?
[47:04.490 --> 47:08.130]  Bobo blaster co. Also you can go visit him, harass him at the chronic boutique.
[47:08.130 --> 47:10.810]  If you're a Colorado medical marijuana patient and you're not a dickhead,
[47:11.130 --> 47:12.730]  you can go check him out. If you're a dickhead,
[47:12.770 --> 47:14.130]  he'll probably just kick you right out.
[47:14.770 --> 47:16.850]  No. And that's as long as you got money, you're going to shop.
[47:17.170 --> 47:20.810]  You're thinking all you want just shop. Drop that bread.
[47:21.410 --> 47:25.810]  Remember he said that somebody please walk in and just fucking grow from your
[47:25.810 --> 47:28.410]  heart. Terps. I just go crazy in there.
[47:28.410 --> 47:32.050]  Job $500 in the counter. Yeah. But I mean, and tip him, fill the tip jar.
[47:32.090 --> 47:33.610]  Oh yeah. Fill that tip.
[47:35.530 --> 47:36.890]  No, you're a medical marijuana patient.
[47:36.890 --> 47:39.090]  Go in there and get the service you deserve. Chris will treat you kindly.
[47:39.090 --> 47:41.210]  We joke around a lot, but Chris will take good care of you.
[47:41.810 --> 47:44.690]  Chris is a good dude. He's got compassion. He knows, he knows about his medicine.
[47:45.170 --> 47:47.650]  He has listened to the podcast long enough that I know he's been trained
[47:47.650 --> 47:52.650]  properly and he is a fucking Terp kid. He loves his Terps.
[47:53.650 --> 47:53.970]  You know,
[47:53.970 --> 47:58.370]  people that love their products this much are educated because we have passion.
[47:58.370 --> 48:00.050]  It's not even an education. It's just a passion.
[48:00.530 --> 48:03.290]  Like when I heard somebody talking about seed stay and they said something that
[48:03.290 --> 48:07.050]  was not wrong, but slightly inaccurate. And I had tried to bite my lip and I was
[48:07.050 --> 48:09.850]  just like, but it flew out of my face. I was like, man,
[48:10.170 --> 48:12.610]  that's not true because of this. And I'm sorry to have to interrupt you and
[48:12.610 --> 48:14.370]  correct you, but I just couldn't hold it. And I'm sorry,
[48:14.410 --> 48:17.490]  this is the accurate part. I still love you. You're still cool as fuck,
[48:17.530 --> 48:21.890]  but let me tell you the truth here. Like sometimes it's a passion.
[48:22.210 --> 48:25.410]  I feel like a cannabis historian sometimes. Like I have to,
[48:25.410 --> 48:29.930]  I am preserving the cannabis future when it comes to genetics and the stories
[48:29.930 --> 48:34.170]  and the way it evolved with legalization here in Colorado. We're historians.
[48:34.170 --> 48:37.450]  We're here. We're the front lines. We've got to report the truth.
[48:37.850 --> 48:41.330]  I feel like telling people what crosses of certain strains are.
[48:41.330 --> 48:44.250]  I feel like that's super important because we're only going to cross those
[48:44.250 --> 48:46.210]  strains with more strains and more strains.
[48:46.690 --> 48:48.890]  And it's just going to get murky. Yeah. Yeah.
[48:48.890 --> 48:50.690]  And it's getting more convoluted as it goes.
[48:50.690 --> 48:52.210]  And I think it's super important to kind of,
[48:52.570 --> 48:54.410]  I like to be sort of a historian and I'm sort of,
[48:54.410 --> 48:58.290]  I got some OCD like that and it's one of the things I've volunteered to be a,
[48:58.530 --> 49:02.210]  what is the, an ambassador to this plant? I feel like that's part of my job.
[49:02.250 --> 49:04.650]  So I try to, I try to be as accurate as I can.
[49:04.730 --> 49:06.930]  So if I ever see him OCD about some weed, that's why.
[49:07.490 --> 49:09.610]  It's part of my responsibility. I don't want the,
[49:09.690 --> 49:14.010]  I want the factual shit out there. Not the bullshit. Not the bullshit.
[49:15.010 --> 49:17.370]  Lindsay, you're yawning. Do we need to send you home and let you go to bed?
[49:17.810 --> 49:21.530]  Lindsay need to go night night. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:21.530 --> 49:23.650]  I think we all need another dab. Yeah, definitely. All right.
[49:23.650 --> 49:25.850]  Let's start wrapping up the podcast so that we can hang out and take some dabs
[49:25.850 --> 49:27.890]  without some mics going on. Ladies and gentlemen,
[49:27.890 --> 49:29.010]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[49:29.250 --> 49:31.890]  We're almost to 200 episodes of this podcast.
[49:31.890 --> 49:33.730]  We've been going for a really long time. We've been going so long.
[49:33.730 --> 49:34.970]  We don't even know how fucking long it's been.
[49:34.970 --> 49:37.010]  There could be another year on there that we don't even know about.
[49:37.450 --> 49:38.490]  I'm pretty sure it's two years.
[49:38.490 --> 49:41.490]  I don't think I'd dad myself into a whole nother year without knowing it,
[49:41.490 --> 49:43.970]  but you never know with me. You never know.
[49:43.970 --> 49:46.290]  There's a head injury somewhere in there. So they could have,
[49:46.290 --> 49:49.690]  this could have been seven years of podcasting that I don't even know about
[49:49.690 --> 49:50.290]  right now.
[49:50.290 --> 49:52.050]  You're going to find it all on your computer next week.
[49:52.170 --> 49:52.650]  Yeah.
[49:52.650 --> 49:54.890]  All I gotta do is go in there and look at the computer and see,
[49:54.890 --> 49:55.690]  you go to iTunes,
[49:55.690 --> 49:58.010]  go to podcast episode number one and see when it was recorded.
[49:58.010 --> 49:59.970]  And I think that that'll tell me when all this happened.
[49:59.970 --> 50:03.650]  But somebody is going to tweet me and tell me it'll be a couple of people.
[50:03.650 --> 50:08.370]  It'll be Sammy chunkless. It'll be a, yeah, it's a race. Let's see.
[50:08.370 --> 50:10.010]  There might be a prize for the first person.
[50:10.210 --> 50:12.530]  There could be a prize if you're in Colorado and you're over 21,
[50:12.530 --> 50:14.410]  the prize will be much better than otherwise.
[50:15.770 --> 50:17.530]  And if I see you in person, it gets even better.
[50:20.650 --> 50:23.090]  Don't forget to follow all of us on social media. Stock us. We love it.
[50:23.090 --> 50:27.250]  We appreciate it. The dude grows cup is coming for 20 is coming.
[50:27.490 --> 50:31.970]  I want to know what you think the origin of four 20 is. Send me an email,
[50:32.010 --> 50:34.330]  send me a tweet, go to my Facebook. Uh,
[50:34.490 --> 50:36.850]  let me know how you think four 20 started,
[50:36.850 --> 50:39.970]  how the number four 20 got attached to smoking weed.
[50:39.970 --> 50:43.010]  I want to know what you think. We'll talk about it on a future episode. Uh,
[50:43.010 --> 50:46.650]  maybe we'll put out an episode on four 20 where we talk about four 20 being four
[50:46.650 --> 50:49.730]  20 and how four 20 became four 20 at four 20 on four 20.
[50:51.250 --> 50:55.530]  Lindsay's head just four 20 all over itself. Dang. All right.
[50:55.530 --> 50:57.690]  I'm going to wrap up this podcast because we were obviously rambling.
[50:57.690 --> 51:01.290]  My throat's dry as shit. I need a drink. I need a dab. Lindsay needs a nap.
[51:02.130 --> 51:06.050]  Yeah, for sure. Chris, what do you need out of life right now? Just in the devil.
[51:06.450 --> 51:10.170]  Nice. I like how simple you are. Nice and simple. An artist's life. All right.
[51:10.610 --> 51:14.010]  I want to give a huge, huge shout out to the dad and granny. Granny, I miss you.
[51:14.090 --> 51:16.050]  Can't wait to see you this weekend. Ladies and gentlemen,
[51:16.050 --> 51:17.530]  thank you again for listening and until next time,
[51:17.570 --> 51:20.090]  take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
