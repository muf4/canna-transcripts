[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  Hey, welcome to the show everybody!
[00:01.860 --> 00:05.480]  It's time for episode 367 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.480 --> 00:08.480]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.480 --> 00:12.920]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:12.920 --> 00:19.000]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.040]  I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[00:22.040 --> 00:26.520]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Screamin' Watermelon from Viola, and when my guest showed
[00:26.520 --> 00:30.880]  up we took a few dabs of the Copper Chem from Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.400]  I've already hinted that this episode will have a guest.
[00:33.400 --> 00:35.760]  I know a lot of you are looking forward to the Grow Lessons.
[00:35.760 --> 00:39.720]  I promise you that the next episode, we will get back on the Grow Lessons.
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.320]  Mike was available to record.
[00:41.320 --> 00:43.120]  I had to take that opportunity.
[00:43.120 --> 00:44.800]  Jesse was available to record.
[00:44.800 --> 00:46.560]  I had to take the opportunity.
[00:46.560 --> 00:50.240]  I do like having great guests on the show, even if it does kind of disrupt the flow of
[00:50.240 --> 00:53.760]  the lessons, and I think you guys will enjoy this podcast.
[00:53.760 --> 00:57.560]  So ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's welcome Jesse to the show.
[00:57.560 --> 01:01.800]  All right, podcast world, welcome back to the show.
[01:01.800 --> 01:02.800]  I am here with Jesse.
[01:02.800 --> 01:03.800]  Welcome to the show, my friend.
[01:03.800 --> 01:04.800]  Hey, what's up?
[01:04.800 --> 01:05.800]  Thanks for having me.
[01:05.800 --> 01:06.800]  Man, thanks for hanging out.
[01:06.800 --> 01:08.000]  Thanks for taking time out of your busy life.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.280]  We were talking about, I think you said you had a staff of 15 people you're in charge
[01:11.280 --> 01:12.280]  of now?
[01:12.280 --> 01:13.760]  No, at one point it was.
[01:13.760 --> 01:14.760]  At one point.
[01:14.760 --> 01:15.760]  Okay, all right, all right.
[01:15.760 --> 01:16.760]  You're still a busy man.
[01:16.760 --> 01:17.760]  Yes.
[01:17.760 --> 01:19.320]  Thanks for coming and hanging out, taking time out of the day, out of the evening.
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.320]  You bet.
[01:20.320 --> 01:21.320]  It's getting cold, man.
[01:21.320 --> 01:23.000]  How are you running Outdoor Grows in this cold?
[01:23.240 --> 01:24.240]  That's the most challenging part.
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.240]  Well, the place I work at, it's a greenhouse.
[01:28.240 --> 01:29.600]  Oh, well, that's easy enough.
[01:29.600 --> 01:31.000]  You put a roof and some walls on it.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  Yep.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  Nice and easy.
[01:33.000 --> 01:34.000]  There you go.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  All right, guys.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.960]  Jesse is here because a lot of people on social media have been asking him to come back on
[01:37.960 --> 01:40.840]  the show and talk about no-till beds.
[01:40.840 --> 01:42.680]  So we're going to talk about no-till.
[01:42.680 --> 01:44.480]  You just want to jump right into it, bro?
[01:44.480 --> 01:45.480]  Sure.
[01:45.480 --> 01:46.480]  Yeah.
[01:46.480 --> 01:47.480]  Cool.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.600]  First of all, maybe we should explain what no-till is.
[01:48.600 --> 01:53.320]  Let's talk about maybe what no-till is and how it varies from a lot of the traditional
[01:53.320 --> 01:56.880]  methods that I talk about and how most people are taught how to grow.
[01:56.880 --> 01:58.400]  Well, maybe not how most people are taught to grow.
[01:58.400 --> 02:03.440]  If they're on a farm or if they're living that way, they were probably taught no-till.
[02:03.440 --> 02:10.840]  No-till in the cannabis industry, that term gets confused so much.
[02:10.840 --> 02:13.960]  There's a big misunderstanding about it.
[02:13.960 --> 02:21.720]  No-till in real big ag is completely different practices than raised beds and whatnot.
[02:21.720 --> 02:27.880]  Not to knock what we're doing, it's just a misunderstanding of the term.
[02:27.880 --> 02:31.920]  Also permaculture, that's one that gets...
[02:31.920 --> 02:36.920]  I see permaculture get just tagged on all kinds of stuff that isn't permaculture.
[02:36.920 --> 02:39.640]  I think for a while I was using permaculture wrong.
[02:39.640 --> 02:43.240]  I think Tad Hussey is the only person that actually understands what permaculture really
[02:43.520 --> 02:44.520]  is.
[02:44.520 --> 02:45.520]  He knows what it is.
[02:45.520 --> 02:46.520]  Shout out to Tad.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.520]  It's a design plan.
[02:47.520 --> 02:50.280]  It's a way to work a piece of land.
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.840]  It's not really something you're going to pull off in your basement.
[02:56.840 --> 03:00.280]  It's a whole farming practice.
[03:00.280 --> 03:01.280]  Farming chessboard, essentially.
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.280]  Yeah.
[03:02.280 --> 03:03.280]  It's cool shit.
[03:03.280 --> 03:04.280]  Yeah.
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.080]  I slightly understand it because of Tad, but yeah.
[03:07.080 --> 03:10.800]  It just gets misconfused a lot.
[03:10.800 --> 03:11.800]  Misconfused, is that a word?
[03:11.800 --> 03:12.800]  Dude, it is now.
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.360]  I thought it was perfect English for you.
[03:15.360 --> 03:16.360]  Nice.
[03:16.360 --> 03:17.360]  But yeah.
[03:17.360 --> 03:18.360]  Fuck, where were we?
[03:18.360 --> 03:19.360]  No-till.
[03:19.360 --> 03:20.360]  No-till.
[03:20.360 --> 03:21.360]  What is no-till?
[03:21.360 --> 03:22.360]  What the hell is a no-till bed?
[03:22.360 --> 03:23.360]  People are chiming in.
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.360]  Most of my people that listen, I have taught them to grow with bottled nutrients because
[03:28.360 --> 03:30.320]  that's what I'm mostly familiar with.
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.320]  We need to tell them what no-till is and how it's different from growing with the bottled
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.320]  nutrients.
[03:35.840 --> 03:43.480]  From what I see, mostly in cannabis, a no-till cannabis bed seems to be a raised bed with
[03:43.480 --> 03:57.120]  a large amount of soil in it that is good amended organic soil.
[03:57.120 --> 04:03.480]  It's also what it says, it's no-till.
[04:03.480 --> 04:04.480]  Tilling is not really something.
[04:04.640 --> 04:08.760]  I think a lot of pot growers actually do with their rototiller.
[04:08.760 --> 04:13.000]  I think a pot growers version of tilling is to dump it out and buy new.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.640]  Find a way, find somewhere to get rid of all of this and then buy brand new at the store
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.640]  is our version.
[04:17.640 --> 04:18.640]  For sure.
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.760]  To me and what I see, it means that they're reusing their soil.
[04:24.760 --> 04:34.200]  They're doing things to build soil, to protect it with cover crops, chop and drop, having
[04:34.200 --> 04:40.800]  worms in there, eating stuff, all kinds of biology in the soil, not feeding it bottled
[04:40.800 --> 04:50.120]  nutrients and top dressing with amendments, compost, feeding compost teas.
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.320]  That's what I see no-till as in cannabis.
[04:54.320 --> 04:57.100]  That gives me a good start of places to ask questions.
[04:57.100 --> 05:00.120]  It sounds like it all starts with our no-till bed.
[05:00.120 --> 05:02.280]  Can we also do this in large pots?
[05:02.280 --> 05:03.280]  For sure.
[05:03.360 --> 05:04.560]  That's what you seem to recommend the beds.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.280]  It seems to be what you talk about a lot.
[05:06.280 --> 05:09.400]  That seems to be what the people on Instagram are asking about too.
[05:09.400 --> 05:16.600]  The larger amount of soil you can work with, the better it's going to work.
[05:16.600 --> 05:17.600]  Trying to create life.
[05:17.600 --> 05:20.760]  You need more space for more life, the more stuff, the more activity, the more space,
[05:20.760 --> 05:21.760]  the more life.
[05:21.760 --> 05:22.760]  For sure.
[05:22.760 --> 05:29.360]  Honestly, you could even apply these practices directly to the ground, to in-ground planted
[05:29.360 --> 05:30.360]  stuff.
[05:30.440 --> 05:38.440]  Honestly, that's where you're going to make the most impact as far as restoring soil in
[05:38.440 --> 05:39.440]  this earth.
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.440]  Right.
[05:40.440 --> 05:41.440]  Long-term sustainability.
[05:41.440 --> 05:42.440]  Rebuilding topsoil and whatnot.
[05:42.440 --> 05:43.440]  Okay.
[05:43.440 --> 05:44.440]  Yeah.
[05:44.440 --> 05:45.680]  End of the world scenario, this would be the way to go.
[05:45.680 --> 05:46.680]  For sure.
[05:46.680 --> 05:47.680]  All right.
[05:47.680 --> 05:48.680]  Yeah.
[05:48.680 --> 05:51.360]  You seem like the type of guy to build your own raised beds.
[05:51.360 --> 05:52.360]  Definitely.
[05:52.360 --> 05:58.880]  Out at the ... Everything I'm talking about pretty much is referencing the project that
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.320]  we got going on at my work right now.
[06:01.280 --> 06:02.280]  Okay.
[06:02.280 --> 06:11.480]  We've built ... They're five by eight and five by 16 length beds.
[06:11.480 --> 06:15.400]  Out of two by eights, they're 16 inches deep.
[06:15.400 --> 06:19.840]  No, my bad.
[06:19.840 --> 06:20.840]  They're not two by eights.
[06:20.840 --> 06:21.840]  They're two by twelves.
[06:21.840 --> 06:22.840]  Okay.
[06:22.840 --> 06:23.840]  Pretty sturdy there.
[06:23.840 --> 06:24.840]  Yeah.
[06:24.840 --> 06:25.840]  24 inches deep.
[06:25.840 --> 06:32.640]  It's just a basic box built out of wood.
[06:32.640 --> 06:33.640]  Square box.
[06:33.640 --> 06:35.880]  Are they on wheels or are they stuck in place?
[06:35.880 --> 06:36.880]  No, no.
[06:36.880 --> 06:37.880]  They're on the ground.
[06:37.880 --> 06:38.880]  Okay.
[06:38.880 --> 06:42.880]  We covered the bottom with a weed fabric to keep the soil from running out.
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.880]  From falling out.
[06:43.880 --> 06:44.880]  Okay.
[06:44.880 --> 06:45.880]  Yeah.
[06:45.880 --> 06:49.560]  Just stapled it to the inside of the bed, filled it up with our soil and rock and roll.
[06:49.560 --> 06:55.680]  Basically just made a big wood pot and used the weed film as the bottom of the pot, right?
[06:56.520 --> 06:57.520]  Yeah.
[06:57.520 --> 06:58.520]  Easy enough.
[06:58.520 --> 06:59.520]  Fill that up with your awesome soil?
[06:59.520 --> 07:00.520]  Yeah.
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.520]  Do you recommend a certain type of soil?
[07:01.520 --> 07:03.200]  Is there something that if they're going to go shopping or if they're going to make a
[07:03.200 --> 07:06.680]  shopping list, a certain kind they can put on there just to make it easy for themselves?
[07:06.680 --> 07:10.840]  I mean, get the best you can.
[07:10.840 --> 07:16.400]  You want something with a lot of organic matter in it for long term.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.880]  Yeah.
[07:18.880 --> 07:20.120]  Just get the best soil you can.
[07:20.120 --> 07:21.560]  I'm not going to mention any names or anything.
[07:21.560 --> 07:22.560]  That's perfect.
[07:22.560 --> 07:25.600]  I'm going to avoid brand names unless there's somebody that I really recommend.
[07:25.600 --> 07:26.600]  Okay.
[07:26.600 --> 07:27.600]  So we've got a raised bed.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.880]  We've got a five by eight or a five by 16.
[07:28.880 --> 07:31.760]  You guys, you can make whatever size raised beds work well for you.
[07:31.760 --> 07:36.960]  I saw a guy on social media who is a smaller fella and he has made some raised beds that
[07:36.960 --> 07:40.840]  are actually five by five by five, but he put a little inlet in the middle so he can
[07:40.840 --> 07:44.640]  walk into the middle of it because he can't reach to work canopy and stuff.
[07:44.640 --> 07:47.880]  He decided and he can fit them together like Tetris pieces.
[07:47.880 --> 07:50.920]  So it looks pretty nice in his grow setup, but they're on wheels also.
[07:51.160 --> 07:55.160]  So you can make whatever size and shape raised beds you like.
[07:55.160 --> 07:56.160]  You can do it in pots.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.160]  You can do it in small pots.
[07:57.160 --> 07:58.160]  You can do it in large pots.
[07:58.160 --> 08:02.720]  What we're going to talk about is mostly going to be in these raised beds.
[08:02.720 --> 08:04.000]  So we've got the bottom in there.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.260]  We've got soil in there.
[08:05.260 --> 08:09.000]  What else are we going to put into our no-till mix?
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.040]  What kind of amendments are we going to add in?
[08:12.120 --> 08:21.320]  I mean, what we did is we just, we use a dry powder nutrient that, uh, before we were every
[08:21.320 --> 08:26.480]  week when we were amending old soil at the end of a cycle, you know, he'd dump it out
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.480]  of the bags.
[08:27.480 --> 08:31.200]  We'd add more compost and more of our powder nutrient.
[08:31.200 --> 08:37.480]  So we just, we started with that basic mix that we use of, you know, it's like a five,
[08:37.480 --> 08:42.000]  four, two nutrient, you know, once I'm not going to mention names, but it's just, it's
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.720]  just, it's like kelp and fucking, uh, crab shell meal and azomite.
[08:48.720 --> 08:51.800]  That's what I'm looking for is a kill crab shell.
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.760]  So we just use an all in one, uh, you know, just the agricultural nutrient.
[08:56.760 --> 08:57.760]  Okay.
[08:57.760 --> 08:58.760]  So there's something that's available.
[08:58.760 --> 09:01.640]  If they do a little research, they'll probably find that product you're talking about.
[09:01.640 --> 09:02.640]  Definitely.
[09:02.640 --> 09:03.640]  Yeah.
[09:03.640 --> 09:04.640]  It's a, it's got kelp meal.
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.640]  There's crab meal.
[09:05.640 --> 09:06.640]  There's azomite in there.
[09:06.640 --> 09:07.640]  Uh, would you add some worm casting?
[09:07.640 --> 09:08.640]  There's that included in this product?
[09:08.640 --> 09:09.720]  Um, no, no.
[09:09.720 --> 09:16.680]  So I would also add, um, you know, we normally do, uh, probably like a quarter yard of compost
[09:16.680 --> 09:18.840]  or worm castings every week.
[09:18.840 --> 09:25.760]  Um, you know, so, you know, I'm talking about, uh, like a 20 yard pile of soil here.
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.960]  So I think, no, no, I'm definitely talking about a 20 yard pile of soil.
[09:31.960 --> 09:35.320]  So we're adding in more like a yard, yard of compost.
[09:35.320 --> 09:39.240]  This is stuff, you know, it's been getting this week after week after week.
[09:39.760 --> 09:42.600]  So leave some room in your no-till bed, you guys, because you're going to need to top
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.120]  dress and you're going to be adding stuff in there.
[09:44.120 --> 09:45.840]  But at the same time, the plants are going to eat that up.
[09:45.840 --> 09:48.760]  So some of it's going to go, some of it's going to add in, but leave some room.
[09:48.760 --> 09:49.760]  Don't fill all the way up to the top.
[09:49.760 --> 09:52.000]  I never recommend you fill your pots all the way to the top.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.400]  Anyway, you want water room.
[09:53.400 --> 09:55.360]  You want more add in space should you need it.
[09:55.360 --> 09:58.360]  So don't go all the way to the top when you're filling your raised beds.
[09:58.360 --> 10:01.600]  So we've got some compost, we've got some worm castings, we've got this agricultural
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.360]  mix or you can get the independent blends of crab meal, kelp meal, blood meal, fish
[10:06.360 --> 10:08.320]  meal, bone meal, whatever you want to put in there.
[10:08.320 --> 10:09.320]  Oyster shell meal.
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.040]  You can add all these other things to your mix at your discretion.
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.120]  If you would like, you can find tons of recipes online for making a no-till bed.
[10:17.120 --> 10:19.480]  I think Build-A-Soil will have a great recipe.
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.720]  I'm pretty sure Clackamas Coop probably has some recipes available.
[10:23.720 --> 10:25.600]  You can design your own recipe.
[10:25.600 --> 10:28.560]  We're going to leave a little work up to you, but we're going to give you a good guideline
[10:28.560 --> 10:29.560]  on how to do this.
[10:29.560 --> 10:32.400]  I'm not going to point you in all the product directions, but we'll give you a pretty good
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.400]  guideline.
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.920]  Don't get caught up with trendy stuff.
[10:38.520 --> 10:43.960]  It's not the name of the label of the product that makes this work.
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.520]  I've noticed when you go to the farm store and the big horticultural store, wow, that
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.720]  word got hard.
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.720]  There aren't really cool logos on the products.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.680]  There's no pretty babes on the advertising.
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.800]  It is a white bag and it says potassium phosphate.
[10:59.800 --> 11:01.120]  That's what's in that bag.
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.040]  It's not a bunch of water and a bunch of other shit.
[11:03.040 --> 11:05.320]  So yeah, don't be sold on trendy names.
[11:05.320 --> 11:06.680]  Don't be sold on advertising.
[11:06.680 --> 11:07.840]  Don't worry about that.
[11:07.840 --> 11:10.760]  Get the things that we need for the garden.
[11:10.760 --> 11:16.600]  These are what the people who were farming to survive before they ever had cool labeling.
[11:16.600 --> 11:19.440]  These are the products that the farmers are using.
[11:19.440 --> 11:20.920]  Farmers are farming to survive.
[11:20.920 --> 11:23.120]  They've got much more on the line than a cannabis grower.
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.120]  Oh yeah.
[11:24.120 --> 11:25.120]  I mean, yeah.
[11:25.120 --> 11:26.800]  They're living on the whole farm.
[11:26.800 --> 11:27.800]  That's their life.
[11:27.800 --> 11:28.800]  They're feeding the country.
[11:28.800 --> 11:29.800]  Yeah.
[11:29.800 --> 11:30.800]  Yeah.
[11:31.800 --> 11:40.600]  But yeah, I mean, I feel like the amount of soil that you have is more important than
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.640]  what you put in it, as long as it's well amended.
[11:45.640 --> 11:47.520]  And your compost is key.
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.280]  Get the best compost or worm castings you can find.
[11:51.280 --> 11:52.280]  There you go.
[11:52.280 --> 11:54.600]  The best worm castings you can find.
[11:54.600 --> 11:57.520]  Try to find a local worm casting company so they're nice and fresh.
[11:57.520 --> 11:58.840]  They're nice and alive.
[11:58.840 --> 12:01.640]  You should find a couple of live worms in your castings.
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.040]  If you've got a quality company, there will be worms in there.
[12:04.040 --> 12:06.840]  They'll still be wiggling around when they get to you.
[12:06.840 --> 12:10.720]  So we've got a basic idea of what goes into our mix.
[12:10.720 --> 12:12.120]  Does this need any cook time?
[12:12.120 --> 12:14.120]  Yes and no.
[12:14.120 --> 12:15.120]  Okay.
[12:15.120 --> 12:16.120]  I mean, yeah.
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.680]  If you can, let it chill for a couple of weeks.
[12:21.680 --> 12:24.480]  Keep it well watered.
[12:24.480 --> 12:25.480]  But you don't have to.
[12:25.480 --> 12:28.720]  I mean, you can throw plants right in here and then it's going to start doing its thing.
[12:29.600 --> 12:32.760]  And one of the things I hear about no-till is it gets better every single time.
[12:32.760 --> 12:33.760]  In theory.
[12:33.760 --> 12:34.760]  In theory.
[12:34.760 --> 12:36.480]  If we do it correctly, we should make it better every time.
[12:36.480 --> 12:37.480]  Okay.
[12:37.480 --> 12:40.080]  So the first time we can let it cook for a couple of weeks or we can mix up our no-till
[12:40.080 --> 12:44.640]  bed and then we can throw our plants in on day one now if we'd like to?
[12:44.640 --> 12:45.640]  Yeah.
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.760]  I mean, we didn't have any harsh results from it.
[12:49.760 --> 12:50.760]  All right.
[12:50.760 --> 12:53.960]  Well, one of the main differences here is we're not going to force feed these plants
[12:53.960 --> 12:54.960]  like we would be with bottles.
[12:54.960 --> 12:56.600]  With the bottles, you're kind of force feeding.
[12:56.600 --> 13:00.280]  They don't get to decide what they take in because everything's been buffered and chelated.
[13:00.280 --> 13:01.360]  Here it's organic.
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.880]  The roots run around and they go, huh?
[13:02.880 --> 13:03.880]  Oh, look, nitrogen.
[13:03.880 --> 13:04.880]  I'm going to eat up some of that.
[13:04.880 --> 13:05.880]  Phosphorus.
[13:05.880 --> 13:06.880]  Oh, I don't need so much phosphorus.
[13:06.880 --> 13:08.640]  Hey guys, do we need potassium up there?
[13:08.640 --> 13:10.040]  No, we're good on potassium.
[13:10.040 --> 13:11.520]  Let's just get this nitrogen for now, guys.
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.880]  We'll leave that potassium behind.
[13:12.880 --> 13:13.880]  We know it's here.
[13:13.880 --> 13:14.880]  We can come get that when we need it.
[13:14.880 --> 13:15.880]  And the plant eats it well.
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.520]  When you're feeding it bottled nutrients, you're basically going, eat bitch, and you're
[13:18.520 --> 13:19.520]  force feeding it.
[13:19.520 --> 13:20.760]  It's got to eat what you feed it.
[13:20.760 --> 13:21.760]  That's how you get those burns.
[13:21.760 --> 13:22.760]  Right.
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.400]  It sounds like we'll be safe just going right into our no till soil mix.
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.320]  Just don't amend it so much that it would heat up.
[13:30.320 --> 13:31.480]  There you go.
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.320]  So with no till, you know, you just, we're constantly top dressing.
[13:36.320 --> 13:39.400]  We top dress those beds at work every other week.
[13:39.400 --> 13:43.280]  So I think I may have been going into this thinking it's too much like a super soil in
[13:43.280 --> 13:44.280]  the beginning.
[13:44.280 --> 13:48.640]  I need to back my brain out of the super soil idea and not put so much in in the beginning
[13:48.640 --> 13:49.640]  and just keep going.
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.640]  Definitely.
[13:50.640 --> 13:51.640]  Okay.
[13:51.640 --> 13:52.640]  Yeah.
[13:52.720 --> 13:53.720]  I think I had to correct my direction with this.
[13:53.720 --> 13:54.720]  I had to correct my thought process.
[13:54.720 --> 13:57.280]  And I think I just realized that I was trying to make this super soil.
[13:57.280 --> 13:59.000]  I was combining no till and super soil.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.240]  I mean, you could start with, well, I wouldn't start with the, the super soil recipe, but
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.240]  see, that's another term that has been diluted.
[14:08.240 --> 14:14.920]  So you know, back in the day, super soil meant sub cool, but now super soil could mean a
[14:14.920 --> 14:21.440]  hundred different fucking, I've seen so many things advertised as super soil and you know,
[14:21.440 --> 14:23.120]  it's just, it's so, it's confusing.
[14:23.120 --> 14:24.120]  Okay.
[14:24.120 --> 14:28.040]  So I've got to get my brain out of the idea of thinking that this was similar to building
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.280]  a, a soil that you pre-mix and then you just water basically till the end.
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.360]  We're going to be more amending and top dressing to keep this going and keeping it fresh.
[14:36.360 --> 14:37.360]  For sure.
[14:37.360 --> 14:38.360]  Okay.
[14:38.360 --> 14:40.800]  That's that corrects my thought process and it'll change my line of questioning for you
[14:40.800 --> 14:41.800]  a little bit too.
[14:41.800 --> 14:42.800]  Awesome.
[14:42.800 --> 14:43.800]  All right.
[14:43.800 --> 14:44.800]  So you guys, we all learned something today.
[14:44.800 --> 14:45.800]  That's the fun of this podcast.
[14:45.800 --> 14:53.360]  Like the, the beds that we have at work that have been on the steady top dressing regimen,
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.840]  you can dig down into the top dress a little bit and there are just millions of fucking
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.280]  worms just eating that shit up.
[15:00.280 --> 15:01.280]  Yeah.
[15:01.280 --> 15:02.280]  Fucking.
[15:02.280 --> 15:05.000]  And if you look underneath the worms a little bit, it's fucking worm castings.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.440]  I mean, it's like a goddamn fucking worm casting factory.
[15:09.440 --> 15:11.560]  It's it's amazing, man.
[15:11.560 --> 15:19.680]  I've never done no till with this success or on this level before, but every day I go
[15:19.680 --> 15:22.720]  in, I'm just like, fucking, what am I going to see today?
[15:22.720 --> 15:24.280]  It's fucking, it's awesome, man.
[15:24.280 --> 15:25.280]  That is awesome.
[15:25.280 --> 15:27.000]  Do you get any mushrooms that grow out of it?
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.560]  No, not yet.
[15:28.560 --> 15:30.080]  Not yet, but maybe in the future.
[15:30.080 --> 15:32.080]  He grabbed his phone when I said that with excitement.
[15:32.080 --> 15:33.080]  That was cool.
[15:33.080 --> 15:34.960]  My phone's literally about to die.
[15:34.960 --> 15:37.200]  I don't have that type of charger.
[15:37.200 --> 15:38.200]  Yeah.
[15:39.200 --> 15:44.440]  Even if he did, it's the fucking, the new Samsung fucking charger shit.
[15:44.440 --> 15:47.040]  It's like different than the.
[15:47.040 --> 15:48.720]  I love when companies do that.
[15:48.720 --> 15:49.880]  Now you have to buy new shit.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.880]  All right.
[15:50.880 --> 15:52.760]  So we've got an idea of what goes in at first.
[15:52.760 --> 15:53.760]  We don't have to cook it.
[15:53.760 --> 15:55.040]  We can throw some plants in there.
[15:55.040 --> 15:57.880]  Now let's talk about these things we keep talking about.
[15:57.880 --> 16:00.000]  Should we go over a cover crop or top dressing first?
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  Oh wow.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.400]  He's showing me the mycelium layer.
[16:03.400 --> 16:06.000]  Is that alfalfa or clover growing there?
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  That's clover.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.880]  He's got clover growing out of the soil here.
[16:08.880 --> 16:10.360]  He's got some stuff that is sprouted.
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.200]  There are things that are ready to sprout.
[16:12.200 --> 16:18.600]  So that's like malted barley and the mycelium just grows off the barley.
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.480]  And if you lift up that barley, there's just like all kinds of little baby worms in there.
[16:24.480 --> 16:25.720]  That's amazing.
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.680]  On his phone, I think the area that I can see is about a foot by a foot square probably.
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.200]  And there is a small environment that is a life cycle happening on that little photo.
[16:34.200 --> 16:35.200]  Yeah.
[16:35.200 --> 16:36.360]  You could take that somewhere and create life.
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.240]  If you took that to a planet, you'd have existence on that planet in a few weeks.
[16:40.240 --> 16:41.240]  Right.
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.880]  I totally, when I'm all looking at it, think that kind of shit.
[16:45.880 --> 16:46.880]  Yeah.
[16:46.880 --> 16:47.880]  I think that's where the weed growing is.
[16:47.880 --> 16:51.680]  The people that think about little microorganisms, that's just where we've gone now.
[16:51.680 --> 16:53.040]  We've learned so much about the planet.
[16:53.040 --> 16:54.880]  We're like, oh, there's so much life right there.
[16:54.880 --> 16:55.880]  Yeah.
[16:55.880 --> 16:56.880]  I love it.
[16:56.880 --> 16:57.880]  Our friend Frosty would say, life, bro.
[16:57.880 --> 16:58.880]  I love it.
[16:58.880 --> 16:59.880]  Just so much life.
[16:59.880 --> 17:00.880]  That's what Frosty would say.
[17:00.880 --> 17:03.200]  I always think of the dude from Jurassic Park.
[17:03.200 --> 17:06.200]  Life finds a way.
[17:07.040 --> 17:08.040]  Always.
[17:08.040 --> 17:09.040]  All right.
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.200]  Should we talk about cover crop or top dress?
[17:12.200 --> 17:14.560]  Cover crop.
[17:14.560 --> 17:22.480]  There are some mainstream popular cover crop blends and I don't like any of them.
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.360]  They have plants in them that in my opinion don't really work well with indoor cannabis
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.600]  or greenhouse cannabis.
[17:31.600 --> 17:35.200]  Currently I'm just using a white Dutch clover.
[17:35.200 --> 17:36.200]  Okay.
[17:36.200 --> 17:37.200]  White Dutch clover.
[17:37.200 --> 17:39.760]  At the agricultural store by the pound.
[17:39.760 --> 17:41.600]  I mean, yeah.
[17:41.600 --> 17:42.600]  It looks like it works.
[17:42.600 --> 17:43.600]  It's like four bucks a pound or so.
[17:43.600 --> 17:44.600]  It looks like it's working.
[17:44.600 --> 17:47.680]  You just sprinkle that in there and it grows naturally out of the top as you water in.
[17:47.680 --> 17:49.640]  It falls in and works like nature works.
[17:49.640 --> 17:50.640]  Definitely.
[17:50.640 --> 17:56.320]  And then right before harvest, we chop it and we mulch the bed with it and it gets to
[17:56.320 --> 17:58.080]  chill for a week.
[17:58.080 --> 17:59.240]  Worms come up, eat it.
[17:59.240 --> 18:07.080]  We put the barley into the, the bar, the mulch barley powder is like worm magnet.
[18:07.080 --> 18:09.040]  Wherever we put it, worms show up.
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.040]  So that's awesome.
[18:10.040 --> 18:11.040]  Yeah.
[18:11.040 --> 18:12.040]  It's fucking, it's so rad.
[18:12.040 --> 18:15.960]  Just sprinkle some of that in and watch the worms come do their work.
[18:15.960 --> 18:17.360]  And then it also grows the mycelium.
[18:17.360 --> 18:18.360]  Yeah.
[18:18.360 --> 18:22.440]  And it breaks down that waste and it just, I mean, I know these are just indoor beds,
[18:22.440 --> 18:24.520]  but we're literally building top soil.
[18:24.520 --> 18:25.520]  Yeah.
[18:25.520 --> 18:27.640]  Oh, the picture you showed me is better than any soil you can buy.
[18:27.640 --> 18:28.640]  Yeah.
[18:29.040 --> 18:30.040]  You can't buy anything like that.
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.760]  That's, that looks like it, but the little area by the park, about 20 feet away from
[18:34.760 --> 18:39.440]  where the little stream runs through, it's got that real moist, soilless soil kind of
[18:39.440 --> 18:40.440]  area.
[18:40.440 --> 18:41.440]  It's getting a little funk on it.
[18:41.440 --> 18:42.440]  It's kind of swampy.
[18:42.440 --> 18:45.080]  That's what you've built right there is that type of environment.
[18:45.080 --> 18:52.360]  So we, we haven't made a lot of it yet, but we're actually making our own compost on site
[18:52.360 --> 18:56.920]  out of just chicken shit and, and cannabis waste.
[18:56.920 --> 18:57.920]  Awesome.
[18:58.200 --> 19:00.200]  So we've made about a half yard so far.
[19:00.200 --> 19:03.640]  I think I saw a picture of it and it looked really, it looked really, I saw you looming
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.160]  through it and it looked really fluffy.
[19:05.160 --> 19:11.240]  And it's everything that we've put it on just, yeah, it's that shit's a fucking rat, man.
[19:11.240 --> 19:12.240]  I love it.
[19:12.240 --> 19:13.240]  I love your farm style.
[19:13.240 --> 19:14.240]  Yeah.
[19:14.240 --> 19:17.720]  It's so far from how I learned and how I was taught that it's fascinating to me.
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.320]  I understand it, but I'm still like, wow, I want to play that way.
[19:21.320 --> 19:25.560]  Just so far from all of every, like just how I learned, you know, I've learned with bottles
[19:25.560 --> 19:26.560]  and I was taught with bottles.
[19:27.280 --> 19:30.680]  I mean, so it was, I, yeah, it's like leaving karate school and going to jujitsu.
[19:30.680 --> 19:33.720]  I can't kick after all around on the ground.
[19:33.720 --> 19:34.720]  This sucks.
[19:34.720 --> 19:35.720]  Can't breathe.
[19:35.720 --> 19:36.720]  All right.
[19:36.720 --> 19:41.120]  So how about, uh, so we've got a little white, some Dutch white clover.
[19:41.120 --> 19:42.120]  We've got some malted barley.
[19:42.120 --> 19:43.240]  We're just sprinkling that in there.
[19:43.240 --> 19:46.800]  How often do we want to do that about once a week?
[19:46.800 --> 19:47.800]  Malted barley.
[19:47.800 --> 19:51.760]  Well, the, the clover you plant that once.
[19:51.760 --> 19:52.760]  Okay.
[19:52.760 --> 19:55.920]  I recommend, well, not just once, but like once per cycle.
[19:56.280 --> 19:57.280]  Okay.
[19:57.280 --> 19:58.280]  Once per cycle.
[19:58.280 --> 20:04.560]  So I recommend just planning it, uh, after you plant your, your cannabis plants.
[20:04.560 --> 20:05.560]  Okay.
[20:05.560 --> 20:06.560]  So it'll just fill it around it.
[20:06.560 --> 20:07.560]  Yeah.
[20:07.560 --> 20:08.560]  Yeah.
[20:08.560 --> 20:09.560]  All right.
[20:09.560 --> 20:12.800]  Um, and you know, look for other plants you're interested in growing.
[20:12.800 --> 20:18.080]  Um, and if you've got a big enough container, fit them in there, man.
[20:18.080 --> 20:23.680]  This is a random question since we're adding cover crop, but we're also adding, we're adding
[20:23.680 --> 20:24.680]  cover.
[20:24.680 --> 20:25.680]  So we're shading the top soil.
[20:26.440 --> 20:29.120]  We're creating a little layer, but we're also adding more plants that are eating from that
[20:29.120 --> 20:30.120]  layer.
[20:30.120 --> 20:31.120]  Do we do water more or less frequently?
[20:31.120 --> 20:33.120]  Do you find yourself in a no-till environment?
[20:33.120 --> 20:36.440]  Um, the beds that have cover crop use less water.
[20:36.440 --> 20:37.440]  Okay.
[20:37.440 --> 20:39.240]  That's going to help because you're getting shade and you've got something to trap that
[20:39.240 --> 20:40.240]  water in there.
[20:40.240 --> 20:42.000]  Less evaporation and then less light.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  Okay.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  That's a cool thing that's going to happen for you.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  Yeah.
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.360]  It's get a whole nother day out of it.
[20:46.360 --> 20:47.360]  Yeah.
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.360]  People are going a whole day.
[20:48.360 --> 20:49.360]  Yeah.
[20:49.360 --> 20:50.360]  And a commercial environment, bro, a whole day.
[20:50.360 --> 20:51.360]  It is changing stuff at work.
[20:51.360 --> 20:52.360]  It's insane.
[20:52.360 --> 20:53.360]  Yeah.
[20:53.360 --> 20:54.360]  We might've talked a little bit about that.
[20:55.360 --> 20:59.680]  Um, and then we're going to get irrigation on it too.
[20:59.680 --> 21:07.440]  So that's, it's, it's going to be insane how much, uh, how little work it's going to take.
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.440]  That's awesome.
[21:08.440 --> 21:14.480]  All the work's going to be just like specifically to the plant, you know, not, not, uh, worry
[21:14.480 --> 21:17.840]  about water and, or this or that or that.
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.960]  Where exactly, where to put what top dress and exactly how to time it and then where
[21:21.960 --> 21:25.560]  to prune and lollipop and pop and twist run.
[21:25.560 --> 21:27.600]  Can't you do a trellising and stuff also?
[21:27.600 --> 21:31.640]  So we're working on building a trellising game.
[21:31.640 --> 21:33.640]  Um, we're learning a lot.
[21:33.640 --> 21:35.000]  We're getting, we're getting better at it.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  I love trellising bro.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.880]  If you want some guidance, just ask.
[21:37.880 --> 21:40.240]  I was taught by a person who's really good at trellising.
[21:40.240 --> 21:42.040]  I was very good at it.
[21:42.040 --> 21:43.040]  Yeah.
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.200]  I used to do six foot wide by 75 foot strips of just one piece of net all the way down.
[21:48.200 --> 21:49.200]  Nice.
[21:49.200 --> 21:50.200]  Yeah.
[21:50.200 --> 21:51.200]  It was that's people hated it.
[21:51.440 --> 21:53.760]  I'm just going to work them in so much fun.
[21:53.760 --> 21:54.760]  All right.
[21:54.760 --> 21:57.720]  So we've got some, uh, white Dutch white clover.
[21:57.720 --> 21:59.400]  We've got our malted barley.
[21:59.400 --> 22:01.280]  We've talked about worm castings in the mix.
[22:01.280 --> 22:04.320]  We have got, uh, some compost in the mix.
[22:04.320 --> 22:07.520]  Uh, what else are we going to need to add in as things go on?
[22:07.520 --> 22:10.880]  Are we going to be set to jet until harvest time with that mix in there?
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.960]  So I make a tea every other week.
[22:12.960 --> 22:13.960]  Okay.
[22:13.960 --> 22:19.840]  Just basically compost and, uh, compost and or castings and molasses.
[22:20.240 --> 22:24.160]  It's real fungal dominant tea and get in there and get the roots all activated and bunch
[22:24.160 --> 22:25.440]  of microbes and get it living.
[22:25.440 --> 22:28.200]  Uh, put a little kelp and alfalfa in there.
[22:28.200 --> 22:29.200]  Yeah.
[22:29.200 --> 22:30.200]  And pretty much that's it.
[22:30.200 --> 22:33.920]  I think the kelp will help with your, uh, your flavor and your density and the aroma.
[22:33.920 --> 22:34.920]  For sure.
[22:34.920 --> 22:36.960]  I always think kelp helps with flavor and density and aroma.
[22:36.960 --> 22:37.960]  Yeah.
[22:37.960 --> 22:40.880]  It helps, uh, encourage my ceiling growth.
[22:40.880 --> 22:41.880]  Yeah.
[22:41.880 --> 22:42.880]  Nature, nature.
[22:42.880 --> 22:45.600]  I like ocean products in the grow.
[22:45.600 --> 22:46.600]  All right.
[22:46.600 --> 22:49.840]  So basically now, uh, you've just got to keep it wet and then give it the tea and make
[22:49.840 --> 22:54.400]  sure none of the top stuff starts dying off on you, keeping it healthy.
[22:54.400 --> 22:57.280]  And then harvest time comes and then you chop, right?
[22:57.280 --> 22:58.280]  Yeah.
[22:58.280 --> 23:01.000]  But what are people going to say about not flushing a no-till?
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  That's what I'm curious about.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.840]  There's no flush time.
[23:03.840 --> 23:07.320]  Um, it's all organic, so we're not force feeding it anything.
[23:07.320 --> 23:10.640]  So there's no built up salts and residues to flush out while my computer just went into
[23:10.640 --> 23:11.640]  a screensaver.
[23:11.640 --> 23:12.640]  We're still recording.
[23:12.640 --> 23:13.640]  That's cool.
[23:13.640 --> 23:14.640]  Yeah.
[23:14.640 --> 23:19.320]  We, uh, we quit feeding teas, you know, a few weeks before, but the, the plants, uh,
[23:19.320 --> 23:21.240]  or a few weeks before harvest.
[23:21.240 --> 23:27.680]  Uh, but the plants, um, are going through a fade and everything, you know, just like,
[23:27.680 --> 23:30.560]  just like they naturally would because they're, like I said earlier, we're not force feeding
[23:30.560 --> 23:31.560]  them.
[23:31.560 --> 23:33.880]  They're just, they're only taking up, they go, Oh, it's probably the end of my cycle.
[23:33.880 --> 23:35.640]  I better start, uh, finishing up here.
[23:35.640 --> 23:37.040]  I've been flowering for nine weeks.
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.040]  For sure.
[23:38.040 --> 23:39.040]  All right.
[23:39.040 --> 23:40.040]  That makes sense to me.
[23:40.040 --> 23:42.920]  So harvest time comes, we chopped down our plants, the plant disappears.
[23:42.920 --> 23:52.960]  We're going to focus on what happens to the no-till soil after the trim crew has taken
[23:52.960 --> 23:54.480]  the plant out of the room.
[23:54.480 --> 23:56.560]  We've got a little stock sticking up out of the plant.
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.240]  Do you just get like a little spade and kind of cut a tiny circle and cut that root ball
[24:00.240 --> 24:01.640]  out or do you just yank it out?
[24:01.640 --> 24:03.440]  Yeah, I'm just pretty much yank it out.
[24:03.440 --> 24:04.440]  Yank it out.
[24:04.440 --> 24:07.400]  It still leaves because you want to leave organic residue in there.
[24:07.400 --> 24:08.400]  Okay.
[24:08.400 --> 24:11.080]  So it's, it still leaves plenty of root system behind.
[24:11.080 --> 24:14.840]  You just let the worm castings and everything else just take care of that for you?
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.840]  Yeah.
[24:15.840 --> 24:20.200]  All that organic matter turns, it turns into worm food and it gets broken down and turned
[24:20.200 --> 24:22.720]  it back into nutrient.
[24:22.720 --> 24:26.640]  Is there any time between, say we've harvested everything and we go through and pull out
[24:26.640 --> 24:28.440]  all the, basically pull out the sticks.
[24:28.440 --> 24:30.880]  Now, is there any time between putting new plants in there?
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.520]  Can we just put them right back in?
[24:32.520 --> 24:35.960]  I mean, yes and no.
[24:35.960 --> 24:45.320]  So I'm, you know, the, the true spirit of no-till, you would want to let it rest for,
[24:45.320 --> 24:47.320]  I mean, at least a month.
[24:47.320 --> 24:48.320]  Okay.
[24:48.320 --> 24:52.360]  You know, true spirit of no-till is going to be more agriculture, you know, traditional
[24:52.360 --> 24:53.360]  ag.
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.840]  So it's going to rest, you know, an entire season.
[24:56.840 --> 24:57.840]  Yeah.
[24:57.840 --> 25:05.080]  So like a lot of the, well, I won't go into that, but yeah, I mean, so commercial no-till
[25:05.200 --> 25:10.560]  is a little different because, you know, figuring out the balance of keeping nutrient and health
[25:10.560 --> 25:12.800]  in the bed plus keeping up productivity.
[25:12.800 --> 25:13.800]  Right.
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.040]  Cause you can't just have half your farm chilling for a season with no growth.
[25:17.040 --> 25:18.040]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.040]  Yeah.
[25:19.040 --> 25:20.040]  That's not an option.
[25:20.040 --> 25:21.600]  Not in Colorado.
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.840]  So can you tell us what you do to, how's your, what's your, what's the word, your compromise?
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.320]  So we're reamending.
[25:30.320 --> 25:34.400]  Ideally we're shooting for a week of rest.
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.920]  We cover the same day we harvest, we give a real nice layer of compost.
[25:40.920 --> 25:43.840]  We chopped the cover crop.
[25:43.840 --> 25:45.640]  We use it to mulch it.
[25:45.640 --> 25:46.640]  Okay.
[25:46.640 --> 25:47.640]  So it just stays right in there.
[25:47.640 --> 25:48.640]  Yeah.
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.360]  And yeah, and it gets a healthy dose of barley that day.
[25:52.360 --> 25:56.680]  So everything just kind of starts breaking down.
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.720]  Ideally we'll, you know, we'll get at least a week.
[26:00.720 --> 26:01.720]  So.
[26:01.720 --> 26:02.720]  Okay.
[26:02.720 --> 26:03.720]  Hopefully.
[26:04.040 --> 26:05.040]  All right.
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.640]  But yeah, I don't know how well that's going to work.
[26:09.640 --> 26:10.640]  We'll see.
[26:10.640 --> 26:11.640]  I hope it goes well for you.
[26:11.640 --> 26:12.640]  Yeah.
[26:12.640 --> 26:13.640]  I'm sitting here brainstorming.
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.440]  I'm like, yeah, well if you reamend, it should be, cause the bottom part is still cooking
[26:17.440 --> 26:19.440]  and it's still cooking all through.
[26:19.440 --> 26:20.440]  Yeah.
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.480]  Ideally, you know, I'd like, I'd like to see like four weeks, but you know, that's just
[26:24.480 --> 26:27.480]  not practical for, for this situation.
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.680]  Do you think that, oh, it's not because the things are breaking down the dying root matter.
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.080]  I was going to ask if you think that that whole four by four or five by what do we have
[26:36.080 --> 26:37.680]  a five by eight, that five by eight bed.
[26:37.680 --> 26:41.400]  Do you think that thing is, it looks like when you pull a plant out of a pot, how it's
[26:41.400 --> 26:42.800]  got roots just thick everywhere.
[26:42.800 --> 26:45.440]  Do you think that whole section is just Rudy like that?
[26:45.440 --> 26:48.440]  No, no, I don't think because things are eating it and decaying it.
[26:48.440 --> 26:49.440]  Right.
[26:49.440 --> 26:50.440]  Okay.
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.440]  Yeah.
[26:51.440 --> 26:52.440]  All right.
[26:52.440 --> 26:53.440]  So I'm just trying to, like I said earlier, this is fascinating to me.
[26:53.440 --> 26:56.000]  I'm trying to envision what's going on toward the bottom of that.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.120]  Cause I can totally envision what's happening about a foot in two feet in, I'm not sure
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.080]  what's going on that far into that soil.
[27:03.080 --> 27:04.080]  Yeah.
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.080]  Yeah.
[27:05.080 --> 27:08.440]  So that's like another part of our talking about the depth.
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.080]  So I mean, true, true no till I feel like we'd be putting a clone in or I shouldn't
[27:14.080 --> 27:20.560]  say true, but the way most people know till they, so when they replant the bed, they're
[27:20.560 --> 27:22.920]  just putting in a little tiny clone.
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.800]  When we replant it, I'm putting in, you know, a 24 to 36 inch.
[27:27.800 --> 27:28.800]  Oh, okay.
[27:28.800 --> 27:29.800]  So these are ready to flower.
[27:29.800 --> 27:30.800]  Yeah.
[27:31.480 --> 27:35.360]  So, so to put, you know, they're in a two gallon pot.
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.920]  So basically we till the top foot of the bed.
[27:40.920 --> 27:46.040]  Um, and you know, that that's going to wreck all kinds of, you know, the biological shit
[27:46.040 --> 27:47.040]  that's been built up.
[27:47.040 --> 27:48.040]  Right.
[27:48.040 --> 27:50.720]  And to disrupt that, but at the same time you're introducing fresh stuff with it, right?
[27:50.720 --> 27:51.720]  For sure.
[27:51.720 --> 27:52.720]  Okay.
[27:52.720 --> 27:53.720]  So it's worth it then.
[27:53.720 --> 27:58.640]  You know, that's another one of the challenges of, uh, uh, no till commercial.
[27:58.640 --> 28:06.240]  So in a place that has to harvest 52 times a year, so it sounds like you've got a pretty
[28:06.240 --> 28:08.680]  good hold on it, a good idea of how to make it work.
[28:08.680 --> 28:12.160]  And I'm faithful that as long as you keep reamending that you'll be able to keep running
[28:12.160 --> 28:13.960]  that bed for sure.
[28:13.960 --> 28:14.960]  That should be forever.
[28:14.960 --> 28:15.960]  Definitely.
[28:15.960 --> 28:20.920]  I'm going to work some soil tests and being a grower that was growing in home grows for
[28:20.920 --> 28:25.560]  a long time back in the day in Colorado, you guys, we could run a lot of plants.
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.080]  You could go to the doctor and you could say my neck and my back, my neck, my back.
[28:30.080 --> 28:32.200]  And they would say, well, then you need to grow 99 plants.
[28:32.200 --> 28:33.200]  Here's your medical record.
[28:33.200 --> 28:35.600]  Honestly, you'd say my money and my back.
[28:35.600 --> 28:37.640]  And then they'd write you out a recommendation.
[28:37.640 --> 28:38.640]  It's too fat.
[28:38.640 --> 28:39.640]  It's fucking my back.
[28:39.640 --> 28:40.640]  Exactly.
[28:40.640 --> 28:41.640]  And they would solve your problem.
[28:41.640 --> 28:45.240]  Leave five of those hundreds at the counter and you can have 99 plants in your house.
[28:45.240 --> 28:46.240]  Yes, sir.
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.200]  Imagine having 99, three gallon pots worth of soil to get rid of every 60 days.
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.080]  And you're trying to be slightly discreet about it because you don't need anybody in
[28:55.600 --> 28:57.800]  the neighborhood know that you've got 99 plants down there.
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.800]  Yeah.
[28:58.800 --> 28:59.800]  That got a little nerve wracking.
[28:59.800 --> 29:03.560]  If you're running the no till, you don't just leave that pot right there forever.
[29:03.560 --> 29:08.920]  I'll probably never do another non no till style grow.
[29:08.920 --> 29:09.920]  Wow.
[29:09.920 --> 29:10.920]  Wow.
[29:10.920 --> 29:13.360]  It's a, it's super fucking easy.
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.680]  So it's, you guys heard it from Jesse.
[29:15.680 --> 29:17.240]  It's super fucking easy.
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.240]  Yeah.
[29:18.240 --> 29:21.960]  He's just, I mean, you gotta have the right amount of soil.
[29:21.960 --> 29:27.320]  We're not going to pull off real no till and like a 20 gallon.
[29:27.320 --> 29:32.520]  I'm thinking like 50 to a hundred gallons at least.
[29:32.520 --> 29:33.520]  Okay.
[29:33.520 --> 29:34.520]  Like a kiddie pool in the closet maybe.
[29:34.520 --> 29:35.520]  Yeah, maybe.
[29:35.520 --> 29:36.520]  All right.
[29:36.520 --> 29:37.520]  About as small as you'd want to go.
[29:37.520 --> 29:43.240]  There's some of those companies that make the, the smart pot style raised no till beds.
[29:43.240 --> 29:44.240]  Oh sweet.
[29:44.240 --> 29:45.240]  Yeah.
[29:45.240 --> 29:47.000]  Those that build a soil place.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.960]  They got a couple of demo tents rocking with, with them.
[29:50.960 --> 29:51.960]  That shit looks good.
[29:51.960 --> 29:55.200]  You know, if you're in the area, go check out, build a soil.
[29:55.200 --> 29:56.200]  I don't work with them.
[29:56.200 --> 29:57.200]  They don't pay me.
[29:57.200 --> 29:58.200]  It's just a cool place.
[29:58.200 --> 30:01.840]  It's growers working for growers, which is that sounds cheesy, but that's what, that's
[30:01.840 --> 30:02.840]  why it's cool.
[30:02.840 --> 30:03.840]  Cause they are growers.
[30:03.840 --> 30:04.840]  Yeah, no, they definitely are.
[30:04.840 --> 30:05.840]  They're all looks up there.
[30:05.840 --> 30:06.840]  Hey bro.
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.840]  Hey bro.
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.840]  Careful there.
[30:08.840 --> 30:09.840]  I've called up there a couple of times.
[30:09.840 --> 30:10.840]  I bet we went up on a Saturday to pick up soil once many moons ago.
[30:10.840 --> 30:11.840]  That was kind of, that was a good time.
[30:11.840 --> 30:12.840]  I think it was like, I think it was like, I think it was like, I think it was like,
[30:12.840 --> 30:13.840]  I think it was like, I think it was like, I think it was like, I think it was like,
[30:14.080 --> 30:24.240]  I like some of the growth shops.
[30:24.240 --> 30:26.240]  I've had a lot of fun.
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.300]  Let's see, we've covered most of the stuff, but we covered cover crop.
[30:30.300 --> 30:31.300]  We've covered top dressing.
[30:31.300 --> 30:34.520]  We talked about feeding it a tea.
[30:34.520 --> 30:39.120]  One of the major questions that you've got was, is it cost-effective in a commercial
[30:39.120 --> 30:40.120]  environment?
[30:40.120 --> 30:41.120]  So far have you found it to be cost-effective?
[30:41.120 --> 30:42.760]  I know it's only your first run.
[30:42.760 --> 30:44.720]  Um, I, I believe so.
[30:44.940 --> 30:45.440]  Okay.
[30:45.600 --> 30:46.100]  Definitely.
[30:46.180 --> 30:53.580]  Um, you know, in half a year I'll have concrete evidence, but you know, that's,
[30:54.500 --> 31:00.300]  um, so far in your, so far in your flowering phase, does it look like your
[31:00.300 --> 31:03.680]  weight is going to be comparable to what you're familiar with in your original,
[31:03.720 --> 31:05.140]  your other styles that you grow?
[31:05.420 --> 31:08.320]  This harvest, I think it's maybe just a little bit bigger.
[31:08.660 --> 31:10.800]  Um, and.
[31:11.800 --> 31:12.980]  I didn't really know.
[31:13.540 --> 31:19.100]  I mean, I knew what I wanted to do, but I hadn't worked out a lot of the, um, like
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.820]  the feeding schedule and stuff like that.
[31:21.460 --> 31:27.300]  Um, when we first started it, um, I, I started really light, you know, I didn't
[31:27.300 --> 31:33.900]  want to, to, uh, overload the soil or, you know, lock it out or anything like that.
[31:34.420 --> 31:37.600]  Um, and that's the exact opposite of what a lot of people will do on their first
[31:37.620 --> 31:38.120]  try.
[31:38.740 --> 31:39.240]  More.
[31:39.240 --> 31:45.740]  So we definitely got yielded as much as we did when we were growing in the pods.
[31:45.780 --> 31:50.780]  So it was in a little bit of, um, we use bio-biz a little bit, so yeah.
[31:51.180 --> 31:51.880]  It's a good product.
[31:52.060 --> 31:52.320]  Yeah.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.460]  Make stuff taste real nice.
[31:53.500 --> 32:00.120]  Um, so in the beds, uh, the, we were using three liquid products.
[32:00.580 --> 32:03.260]  Um, and we didn't use any of those in the bed.
[32:04.000 --> 32:09.920]  So, and you know, so we got probably a little bit more, you know, that works out
[32:09.920 --> 32:10.320]  really good.
[32:10.320 --> 32:14.160]  It sounds like the cost of what you're putting into it is way cheaper than going
[32:14.160 --> 32:16.360]  and buying or having a bunch of nutrients delivered.
[32:16.680 --> 32:19.280]  You don't have to pay for all the extra stuff that's in the news that you don't
[32:19.280 --> 32:19.680]  need.
[32:20.120 --> 32:21.860]  Uh, you're not buying a brand name.
[32:21.860 --> 32:26.040]  Every commercial girl around here is using a one of three, very specific brand
[32:26.040 --> 32:29.680]  names, probably four, I think of four specific brands that are very popular in
[32:29.680 --> 32:32.040]  all the commercial grows and they're expensive as shit.
[32:32.380 --> 32:33.380]  Don't get the job done.
[32:33.420 --> 32:33.780]  Oh yeah.
[32:33.780 --> 32:35.860]  But you got to buy them right now to get them.
[32:35.880 --> 32:38.420]  There's one brand that you can't buy it as a consumer.
[32:38.420 --> 32:40.520]  You have to buy it as a commercial girl.
[32:40.520 --> 32:43.380]  You have to have a commercial account and you have to order a hundred pound
[32:43.380 --> 32:43.880]  minimum.
[32:44.220 --> 32:47.380]  So you have to have, and they like to sell you 150 pounds cause they come in
[32:47.380 --> 32:48.620]  150 pound drum.
[32:48.940 --> 32:52.140]  So you gotta buy 150 pound drum and have it delivered.
[32:52.260 --> 32:53.980]  And yeah, that's a pain in the ass.
[32:53.980 --> 32:55.380]  So it's good stuff though.
[32:55.700 --> 32:56.500]  That is good stuff.
[32:56.500 --> 32:59.260]  It's what I would go by for a commercial girl right now.
[32:59.600 --> 33:00.640]  So I know so much about it.
[33:00.640 --> 33:01.680]  It's why I'm able to get it.
[33:01.680 --> 33:03.880]  Cause I buy the 150 pound orders for other places.
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.440]  If I was doing commercial any other way than this, that's what I would use.
[33:08.600 --> 33:08.960]  Okay.
[33:09.280 --> 33:10.640]  I've had great success with that, bro.
[33:11.320 --> 33:14.840]  So yeah, that's two varying ways of growing and we're both totally satisfied
[33:14.840 --> 33:17.640]  with what we're doing and we're both sitting at a table smoking dads and
[33:17.640 --> 33:18.160]  bros.
[33:18.520 --> 33:18.800]  Yeah.
[33:18.840 --> 33:19.000]  Yeah.
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.200]  You guys don't have to fight about anything.
[33:20.200 --> 33:21.160]  It's the cannabis industry.
[33:21.480 --> 33:22.960]  Our point is to grow the best weed we can.
[33:22.960 --> 33:24.400]  And so we can all smoke good weed together.
[33:25.760 --> 33:28.840]  I grow anyway, you know, pay me the money.
[33:29.780 --> 33:30.700]  I like your style.
[33:31.500 --> 33:34.060]  Uh, let's see something that we can touch on that.
[33:34.060 --> 33:38.140]  Another person asked was, is it a labor effective cost-wise?
[33:38.220 --> 33:39.340]  Yes, that's yeah.
[33:39.340 --> 33:41.220]  I knew that was going to be your answer is why I saved that one.
[33:41.220 --> 33:45.220]  Cause I knew it was going to be short and quick, uh, less man hours.
[33:45.340 --> 33:48.780]  Um, and less, we use less water too.
[33:49.140 --> 33:50.500]  Less man hours and less water.
[33:50.500 --> 33:51.700]  So you're saving a lot of money there.
[33:51.940 --> 33:54.780]  Two of the most expensive things in the grow other than electricity.
[33:54.780 --> 33:57.660]  And you're in a greenhouse, so you just cut down all the money.
[33:57.700 --> 33:58.060]  Nice.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.160]  Uh, bro, is there anything else you want to add about no till before I ask you
[34:02.160 --> 34:04.240]  this one last note that I've got written down?
[34:06.120 --> 34:13.800]  Um, yeah, I mean, if you're serious about getting commercial, go and hit me up.
[34:14.120 --> 34:14.680]  There you go.
[34:14.680 --> 34:15.600]  How can people find you?
[34:15.920 --> 34:17.200]  Hit me up on Instagram.
[34:17.520 --> 34:18.840]  What's your newest Instagram handle?
[34:19.120 --> 34:20.200]  You still Jesse grows.
[34:20.200 --> 34:20.400]  Yeah.
[34:20.400 --> 34:21.640]  Just Jesse goes, all right.
[34:21.800 --> 34:23.080]  At Jesse grows on Instagram.
[34:23.080 --> 34:23.600]  What's your picture.
[34:23.600 --> 34:24.600]  So they know what they're looking for.
[34:24.600 --> 34:25.480]  I think it's Joe dirt.
[34:25.480 --> 34:25.800]  Maybe.
[34:25.860 --> 34:26.820]  No, that's us.
[34:27.060 --> 34:29.020]  That's overgrow who had Joe dirt is his picture.
[34:29.820 --> 34:31.740]  He's going to take a quick look for that support.
[34:31.740 --> 34:33.060]  Jesse, I like support.
[34:33.060 --> 34:33.420]  The crew.
[34:33.420 --> 34:33.780]  Megan.
[34:34.540 --> 34:35.180]  Oh, okay.
[34:35.220 --> 34:36.100]  That makes more sense.
[34:36.100 --> 34:36.380]  Yeah.
[34:37.300 --> 34:38.580]  Um, I will come see you.
[34:38.820 --> 34:44.580]  Uh, um, I want to set up some other big no till places.
[34:44.580 --> 34:45.620]  So hit me up.
[34:45.820 --> 34:47.340]  Dead serious, dead serious.
[34:47.380 --> 34:48.180]  Also dead serious.
[34:48.180 --> 34:50.780]  We're not cheap, but we are worth what we charge you guys.
[34:50.780 --> 34:52.100]  So I'm going to send you a picture.
[34:52.100 --> 34:53.060]  I'm going to send you a picture.
[34:53.120 --> 34:55.720]  We're not cheap, but we are worth what we charge you guys.
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.760]  Uh, pay your consultants what they're worth.
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.540]  Uh, don't try to cheap out on consultants.
[34:59.640 --> 35:02.680]  This is just a random rant, but, uh, you can pay a cheap consultant to come
[35:02.680 --> 35:03.760]  and fuck everything up for you.
[35:03.760 --> 35:06.080]  And then you can pay us the correct price to come and fix it.
[35:06.480 --> 35:09.080]  Or you could just pay us the correct price to do it correctly.
[35:09.140 --> 35:11.400]  The very first time that's up to you.
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.480]  Anyway, uh, before we started recording, Jesse made a joke and said, remind me
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.200]  to talk about dirty Mike, and he doesn't mean white Mike, the guy that comes on
[35:20.340 --> 35:23.700]  the podcast, he means something about a microphone.
[35:23.700 --> 35:26.460]  So he's taking a drink right now, but as soon as he's caught up on that, I'm
[35:26.460 --> 35:29.180]  going to let Jesse talk about his dirty microphone stories.
[35:29.180 --> 35:36.220]  So back in the day, um, I played drums in a couple of punk rock bands and.
[35:36.780 --> 35:40.140]  Uh, the best band I ever played for, which didn't last very long.
[35:40.140 --> 35:41.540]  Cause I wasn't very good.
[35:41.920 --> 35:49.500]  Um, but I sit down at practice and, uh, the, the old drummer had saying,
[35:49.740 --> 35:55.740]  and I look over at his, his Mike and, uh, his, his Mike covers like
[35:55.740 --> 36:00.960]  covered with pieces of food and fucking just shit and fucking, it was so
[36:00.960 --> 36:03.380]  fucking disgusting, horrible.
[36:03.840 --> 36:06.400]  He was like a well-known drummer here in town.
[36:06.400 --> 36:09.960]  And yeah, it just did back then.
[36:09.960 --> 36:15.460]  It was kind of like, like, you know, like a inferiority complex compared to him.
[36:15.520 --> 36:16.960]  And I saw that nasty shit.
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.440]  I'm like, Oh, he's human too.
[36:19.640 --> 36:19.840]  Yeah.
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.200]  He spits when he sings, just like all of us, other grody fuckers.
[36:23.200 --> 36:23.880]  That's so gross.
[36:23.880 --> 36:24.120]  Yeah.
[36:24.420 --> 36:26.560]  Unfortunately, that's all too common in the music industry.
[36:26.560 --> 36:29.200]  If you buy a pawn shop microphone, you got to take it home and
[36:29.200 --> 36:30.900]  sanitize that shit immediately.
[36:31.320 --> 36:31.520]  Yeah.
[36:31.520 --> 36:32.120]  That's gross.
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.080]  Uh, the, uh, the box, the big box store whose name I shall not mention that
[36:36.080 --> 36:39.200]  everybody goes to to buy all their musical equipment, who is the musical devil.
[36:39.460 --> 36:41.560]  They're not allowed to buy in microphone, vocal mics.
[36:41.560 --> 36:44.560]  They can buy in drum mics and like an I five or whatever, but
[36:44.560 --> 36:45.800]  they can't buy in a vocal mics.
[36:45.800 --> 36:48.120]  These Sennheisers, they totally couldn't buy these because we've
[36:48.140 --> 36:50.140]  been spitting into it for months.
[36:51.260 --> 36:51.500]  Yeah.
[36:51.540 --> 36:52.180]  Disgusting.
[36:52.220 --> 36:53.180]  That's a great story, bro.
[36:53.260 --> 36:54.180]  Beautiful, beautiful.
[36:54.180 --> 36:56.780]  And for the podcast, that's how people are going to remember you.
[36:57.260 --> 36:57.740]  Sweet.
[36:58.980 --> 37:02.260]  Uh, man, you've got a few listeners and you've got a mic in front of your face.
[37:02.300 --> 37:03.840]  Anything you want to tell the world while you're here?
[37:03.980 --> 37:04.420]  Yeah.
[37:04.440 --> 37:07.460]  Um, I'm going down to Oklahoma this weekend.
[37:07.560 --> 37:09.600]  I don't think the show will be released by then.
[37:09.620 --> 37:10.540]  I can put it out by then.
[37:10.540 --> 37:11.340]  Yeah, sure.
[37:11.780 --> 37:15.300]  Um, yeah, I'll be down there.
[37:15.300 --> 37:20.760]  9th, 10th and 11th, uh, hanging out, checking out, trying to, uh, find some,
[37:21.360 --> 37:25.720]  some clients to set up some no-till grows for them or any kind of growth.
[37:25.840 --> 37:26.360]  I don't care.
[37:27.200 --> 37:30.560]  If you're in Oklahoma and you need some consulting in the next weekend,
[37:31.080 --> 37:33.600]  hit up our friend Jesse grows at Jesse grows on Instagram.
[37:33.600 --> 37:34.120]  You can find him.
[37:34.120 --> 37:34.840]  He's easy to find.
[37:34.840 --> 37:35.280]  He's handsome.
[37:35.280 --> 37:36.240]  He's got a deep voice.
[37:36.800 --> 37:37.240]  Reach out.
[37:37.240 --> 37:39.760]  He will come set up a no-till grow in Oklahoma for you.
[37:40.240 --> 37:45.160]  Um, outdoor light, um, all kinds of stuff I can help you with.
[37:45.720 --> 37:52.920]  So PS, um, just per cost projections, uh, genetic acquisition.
[37:53.080 --> 37:54.680]  Um, yeah,
[37:55.480 --> 37:56.880]  just about everything you can think of.
[37:57.240 --> 38:01.200]  We've been in the industry long enough to know the shifts and what to expect.
[38:01.200 --> 38:03.200]  We know the way your market is going to go.
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.860]  We're going to, I'm selling us as consultants now.
[38:04.860 --> 38:07.080]  It's so funny, but we know how the market is going to go.
[38:07.080 --> 38:09.600]  We've seen this market here for the past 12 years or so.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.440]  Uh, we've also been in several grows.
[38:11.440 --> 38:12.520]  We know what's going to fail.
[38:12.980 --> 38:17.780]  Uh, we also know how compliance is going to go for you in the next few years.
[38:18.020 --> 38:21.860]  So let us come in and set up your grow to be Colorado compliant today.
[38:22.140 --> 38:25.420]  So that way in the future, when they come and make rules, you're ahead of the
[38:25.420 --> 38:26.900]  game and you can be an example.
[38:27.100 --> 38:31.660]  And when the, whatever the control board is, if they like you, it really helps out.
[38:31.900 --> 38:36.220]  If you try to be, if you're the good kid in school, the teacher likes you, the
[38:36.220 --> 38:39.140]  regulation boards, when it comes to cannabis, they like the same kind of people.
[38:39.300 --> 38:41.580]  So if you're like, Hey, look, we, we already preemptively did
[38:41.600 --> 38:42.640]  this before you made the rule.
[38:42.640 --> 38:43.760]  They're like, damn, you guys are good.
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.100]  They'll, they'll really enjoy coming to your facility and there'll be a little
[38:47.100 --> 38:48.800]  more lenient when shit does go wrong.
[38:48.800 --> 38:50.160]  Because one day something will go wrong.
[38:50.520 --> 38:52.080]  I couldn't say it better myself.
[38:52.140 --> 38:54.180]  That's almost my exact speech too.
[38:55.320 --> 38:58.080]  So then, uh, yeah, if you get too many clients, bro, he let me know.
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.600]  Oh, you know, um, I also, uh, storefront and accounting.
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.840]  Uh, I don't do that myself, but I got plenty of people.
[39:06.840 --> 39:11.200]  I got a magical lady that I'm working on a business plan with her to do.
[39:11.600 --> 39:13.120]  Front of the house, retail consulting.
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.940]  I would recommend her for anything.
[39:15.120 --> 39:16.280]  So we got you covered.
[39:16.280 --> 39:17.120]  We can get your grow going.
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.180]  We can get your retail going.
[39:18.440 --> 39:20.040]  I think that's enough pitching us as consultants.
[39:20.040 --> 39:21.680]  I don't even think that's what we came here for today.
[39:22.120 --> 39:22.920]  Randomly beautiful.
[39:22.960 --> 39:24.000]  Hey, I'm well thrown out there.
[39:24.360 --> 39:24.960]  Good job, brother.
[39:24.960 --> 39:25.480]  Good job.
[39:25.620 --> 39:26.640]  Nah, hit me up though.
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.200]  Even, even if you just want to get high, I'm going to be staying, uh, real close
[39:31.200 --> 39:34.440]  to, uh, uh, where the two interstates meet.
[39:34.560 --> 39:37.080]  So central location and okay.
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.240]  See, there you go guys.
[39:38.240 --> 39:39.300]  Find him, get lit with them.
[39:39.300 --> 39:40.800]  He's a, yeah, you never know.
[39:41.080 --> 39:41.400]  Hang out.
[39:41.600 --> 39:43.600]  I'm not going to discriminate and say anything weird.
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.520]  Now I almost have to edit out.
[39:45.540 --> 39:46.920]  We're going to skip all that, dude.
[39:46.920 --> 39:47.400]  Thanks for coming.
[39:47.400 --> 39:48.600]  Thanks for taking time out of your evening.
[39:48.600 --> 39:50.560]  Let's hang out and take some dabs without these microphones.
[39:50.640 --> 39:51.040]  For sure.
[39:51.240 --> 39:51.680]  Awesome guys.
[39:51.680 --> 39:52.920]  We're going to wrap up this part of the show.
[39:52.920 --> 39:55.560]  I should be back in just a couple of seconds due to the magic of editing.
[39:55.880 --> 39:59.120]  And then we will, uh, I'll put a bow on this bitch is what I think we say.
[39:59.200 --> 39:59.880]  Thanks for hanging out guys.
[39:59.880 --> 40:00.480]  I'll be right back.
