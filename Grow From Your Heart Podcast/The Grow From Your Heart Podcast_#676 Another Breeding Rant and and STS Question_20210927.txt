[02:23.410 --> 02:24.810]  Where do we go from here?
[02:24.810 --> 02:28.930]  I get to talk about being in the greenhouse if you've been watching the show
[02:28.930 --> 02:32.610]  I'm sure you have heard me talk about the greenhouse project. I've got going on. That's right
[02:32.610 --> 02:36.650]  I did some breeding in a greenhouse. I was at the greenhouse earlier today
[02:36.690 --> 02:39.770]  My fingers are still sticky my arm hair is still sticky
[02:39.810 --> 02:47.290]  But I am super excited because the seeds that are happening in that greenhouse are almost ready. They're getting super hard
[02:47.290 --> 02:53.210]  They're getting a nice dark color to them. They're getting some tiger stripes. They look really really good. I'm really excited
[02:53.610 --> 03:00.570]  So pretty soon we will have some outdoor bred iri genetic seeds. I was amazed I've talked about this before on the show
[03:00.570 --> 03:03.050]  I'm just kind of talking about it again because I'm excited
[03:03.050 --> 03:07.810]  I like to give you guys updates on what's going on with my projects bring you in make you feel included
[03:07.810 --> 03:13.370]  But I am super excited those plants happened much more quickly than I expected it to happen
[03:13.370 --> 03:19.250]  They were ready for pollen earlier than I anticipated the pollen dumped earlier than anticipated
[03:19.690 --> 03:21.850]  The seeds hardened up much more quickly
[03:22.450 --> 03:25.050]  So I learned a lot this year with our inaugural
[03:25.410 --> 03:29.690]  Outdoor run people have been asking a lot of questions since I've been hinting about what I put out there
[03:29.690 --> 03:32.730]  I'll give you a couple of a couple of ideas of what went out there this year
[03:32.730 --> 03:36.890]  I did put an arise male the King Solomon male was in the greenhouse
[03:36.890 --> 03:41.370]  So everything that got pollinated was pollinated by King Solomon
[03:41.370 --> 03:44.930]  The first male that I should talk about that we put out there was the platinum tangy
[03:44.930 --> 03:49.010]  Why did I put platinum tangy out there because that makes sun kiss seeds?
[03:49.010 --> 03:54.210]  I'm very familiar with the platinum tangy plant and I'm very familiar with the sun kiss cross
[03:54.370 --> 04:00.090]  So I'll be able to tell what that platinum tangy plant is doing outdoors compared to what it does indoors
[04:00.130 --> 04:04.370]  Then once the seeds are made I've got plenty of that makes sun kisses what that makes
[04:04.370 --> 04:09.610]  I've got plenty of sun kiss seeds that were made indoors. Now. I've got sun kiss made outdoors
[04:09.610 --> 04:15.450]  Now the next move is to grow both of those in similar conditions and see if the outdoor produced seeds
[04:15.530 --> 04:19.250]  Show any difference than the indoor produced seeds of the same cross?
[04:19.250 --> 04:24.090]  I use the same exact genetics, but one was made indoors one was made in a greenhouse
[04:24.090 --> 04:29.890]  I personally honestly realistically do not know if we will see any difference in the expression
[04:30.450 --> 04:36.610]  There were different things in the environment which may fall in line in epigenetics, or I don't know how it may work
[04:36.610 --> 04:39.730]  They may there may be differences what I'm saying is what I'm saying, and I want to grow them
[04:39.730 --> 04:43.770]  I'm excited to find out so we started off with that platinum tangy outdoors
[04:43.810 --> 04:48.210]  There is a blueberry cookies plant outdoors so that we can make more blue raspberry truffle
[04:48.210 --> 04:52.450]  A lot of people are asking for blue raspberry truffle seeds. We're making some outdoors
[04:52.610 --> 04:57.210]  There is a mandarin sunset plant outside so we can make more of the lady marmalade
[04:57.250 --> 05:03.050]  There are some new things some things that I'm making brand new crosses of and there are others out there that we don't need to
[05:03.050 --> 05:08.490]  Talk about right now. I do like leaving a little bit of suspense got to build that suspense a little bit
[05:08.490 --> 05:12.290]  We'll talk more about what's out there in the future, but I wanted to kind of tease you a little bit
[05:12.290 --> 05:15.250]  They're getting the seeds are getting hard the buds are getting fat
[05:15.250 --> 05:18.170]  They are so sticky and so stinky
[05:18.170 --> 05:21.890]  I was out there at the greenhouse and then I had to run a couple of errands and
[05:22.490 --> 05:27.690]  Everywhere I went after that they gave me dirty looks because I was stinking so good. It was beautiful
[05:27.690 --> 05:33.250]  It's a beautiful aroma, but it went so fast it happened so quickly. I was amazed so next year
[05:33.250 --> 05:35.250]  We're going to do things a little bit
[05:35.250 --> 05:40.230]  But a lot of bit differently and we should produce two or three times as many seeds next year
[05:40.230 --> 05:45.470]  I'm excited get excited with me because pretty soon. I will be sending these seeds out for testers
[05:45.470 --> 05:46.110]  All right
[05:46.110 --> 05:50.650]  Now I do want to take a moment to give my buddy Mike a shout out if you are a follower of the podcast
[05:50.650 --> 05:53.710]  You know that oftentimes I do have my buddy white Mike on the podcast
[05:54.190 --> 05:58.350]  Mike is my buddy. He does the we say that I do the grow part of the house
[05:58.350 --> 06:02.750]  I do all the everything that involves plants. That is my job the part that involves paperwork
[06:03.630 --> 06:08.390]  Contacting the lawyer all of that stuff. That is sort of Mike's department
[06:08.390 --> 06:09.990]  So we say that Mike handles the front of the house
[06:09.990 --> 06:11.690]  I handle the back of the house
[06:11.690 --> 06:15.470]  Mike is kind of my tag-team partner when it comes to the cannabis industry
[06:15.550 --> 06:19.710]  Big shout out to Mike for his all of his hard work dedication to our industry in our community
[06:19.710 --> 06:25.210]  What I'm heading at you guys is Mike has a patreon page where he has recently posted a great
[06:25.630 --> 06:30.510]  Patreon post you can go read his post if you are interested in becoming a cannabis
[06:30.630 --> 06:31.710]  activist a cannabis
[06:31.710 --> 06:37.090]  Advocate if you want to be involved if you want to go to City Council and speak if you want some ammo if you want
[06:37.210 --> 06:42.010]  Some education Mike is a great source of that information a great source for that education
[06:42.010 --> 06:45.850]  He recently posted a couple of things on his patreon that I think would be
[06:46.050 --> 06:49.370]  Beneficial for you to read if you want to be active in this community
[06:49.370 --> 06:52.890]  So big up to my buddy might go check him out at patreon.com
[06:53.370 --> 07:00.990]  Forward slash white Mike and really briefly. I'll just explain why we call him white Mike Mike is my buddy that I'm a white guy
[07:00.990 --> 07:03.010]  With dreadlocks. I know that that's a cliche thing
[07:03.010 --> 07:04.410]  But I'm the white guy with dreadlocks
[07:04.410 --> 07:09.570]  Smoking a fat joint with the music too loud in the car driving too fast and Mike will politely remind me
[07:09.570 --> 07:10.530]  He'll say hey, buddy
[07:10.530 --> 07:14.790]  You're the white guy with dreadlocks with the music too loud smoking a joint driving too fast
[07:15.010 --> 07:19.090]  Pick one or two of those and only do one or two of those at a time or you're gonna go to jail today
[07:19.250 --> 07:23.350]  And I'd be like, yeah, you're kind of right buddy. And so it's kind of a joke that I call him white Mike
[07:23.350 --> 07:25.350]  He's just just make sure to follow the rules
[07:25.350 --> 07:31.770]  He's super uptight white guy, but I need that on my team because I'm the fucking opposite. We create a good balance
[07:32.370 --> 07:37.750]  So that's why you got the name white Mike just a white dude super he listens to 311 and where's Jen co's
[07:38.710 --> 07:43.770]  What more white dude? Could you ask for right big shout-out to my buddy white Mike nothing but love for that guy good, dude
[07:43.770 --> 07:50.930]  I read genetics in the podcast would not be here without Mike's encouragement support advice and activism. So big up, dude
[07:50.930 --> 07:55.190]  Thank you. Go support white Mike. That's enough rambling and kissing Mike's ass. Let's move forward
[07:55.190 --> 08:00.450]  I do have some patreon questions here laid out in front of me big up to everybody that supports the show on patreon
[08:00.850 --> 08:07.590]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart, which one do we read first? I think I'm going to grab this one right here
[08:07.590 --> 08:09.590]  It's just to the left of me convenient
[08:09.630 --> 08:13.570]  This one came from do they want their name said they sign their name?
[08:13.890 --> 08:21.850]  J6 big up to J6 at J6 organics. This question says Rasta Jeff. I hope you were keeping well and feeling iry my brother
[08:21.850 --> 08:25.650]  I'm feeling great. Thank you. I hope you're feeling iry. Hope things are good. Hope the plants look good
[08:25.650 --> 08:26.890]  Hope the garden is going well
[08:26.890 --> 08:32.930]  It says here I enjoyed listening to your girl from your heart podcast shows and recently I stumbled upon episode
[08:33.530 --> 08:40.570]  602 where you speak in detail about the silver thiosulfate recipe and the method used in creating your solution
[08:40.730 --> 08:43.730]  Yes, thank you for listening, bro. I'm hoping that that's working well for you
[08:43.730 --> 08:48.330]  I hope you're on the path to making some silver thiosulfate and some femme seeds and thank you for listening
[08:48.330 --> 08:51.570]  By the way, it does say here is my question
[08:51.930 --> 08:58.810]  Upon mixing the two-part solution together. This solution is further diluted to a 1 to 9 ratio sounds like you're on the right path
[08:58.930 --> 09:03.250]  We've made 1 liter and we use up to a hundred milliliters. So yeah, if you got a 1 to 9
[09:03.850 --> 09:07.650]  You didn't mention anything about storing the other 900 milliliters
[09:07.650 --> 09:11.490]  That is a good good point to bring up. Can this solution be stored?
[09:11.490 --> 09:18.090]  If so, what's the best practice for storage and what is the shelf life? Yes, you can store that solution
[09:18.090 --> 09:21.330]  The best practice would be to keep it cold the colder the better
[09:21.690 --> 09:24.250]  The colder you can keep that solution the better it is
[09:24.690 --> 09:29.690]  Ideally, and I probably should have mentioned this before we got to this point. Ideally it would store better
[09:30.450 --> 09:35.970]  Let me start from the very very beginning. We're gonna do a good better best sort of situation here
[09:35.970 --> 09:40.610]  They store better as powders non diluted into anything the powder
[09:40.770 --> 09:44.930]  By itself in the refrigerator and a cool dry dark place is the best way to store it
[09:44.930 --> 09:47.090]  So keep the powder stored that lasts forever
[09:47.090 --> 09:53.490]  Then the next longest storage method is to have part a and part B mixed into the water
[09:53.690 --> 09:58.090]  But not mixed together those will last longer then when you mix them together
[09:58.290 --> 10:02.490]  They last a little bit less time. So I hope I said that in the correct manner
[10:03.210 --> 10:05.210]  Don't mix them. They last the longest
[10:05.490 --> 10:12.250]  Parts a and B the powder into the water will last a little less longer and then once you cross them all together mix them
[10:12.250 --> 10:14.570]  All together it lasts even less longer. So
[10:15.090 --> 10:19.090]  The best way possible would be keep it powder then keep them divided
[10:19.090 --> 10:22.970]  Then once you mix it, you can store it in a cool dry dark place like the refrigerator
[10:22.970 --> 10:26.090]  I've got a jar in the fridge now an important important note
[10:26.090 --> 10:32.890]  If you're going to put your silver thiosulfate in the refrigerator, make sure to clearly mark what that stuff is
[10:32.890 --> 10:36.210]  It is clear. It's odorless. We don't want anybody drinking it
[10:36.210 --> 10:39.890]  I do not think it would be harmful if you took a couple of swigs out of that
[10:40.130 --> 10:42.530]  But let's not give that any risk
[10:42.530 --> 10:48.590]  Let's not give that an opportunity clearly label that silver thiosulfate if you've got children in the house people that can't read
[10:48.890 --> 10:54.810]  People that drink I'm not trying to judge anybody but let's set them up for success. Let's set ourselves up for success
[10:54.850 --> 10:57.770]  Let's clearly label that that is silver thiosulfate
[10:57.770 --> 11:01.730]  Maybe put a ring of tape around the the rim of the jar the bottle so that nobody can
[11:01.810 --> 11:06.250]  easily pull that open to if they do open it they go why the fuck is our electrical tape or duct tape on my
[11:06.250 --> 11:12.570]  My moonshine or my jar of water here make them think another step before they pour that silver thiosulfate down their goal and make themselves
[11:12.570 --> 11:14.290]  Sick and blame it on you
[11:14.290 --> 11:21.010]  Set yourself up for success set everybody in your house up for success by clearly labeling the silver thiosulfate that is stored in your fridge
[11:21.010 --> 11:24.570]  Mine is in a bag and then it's labeled and then it's clear
[11:24.570 --> 11:27.130]  I'm the only one here that goes in the fridge. Nobody else is going in there
[11:27.130 --> 11:29.650]  so if anybody else goes in there and drink it, they're an intruder and
[11:30.490 --> 11:32.990]  They can have the diarrhea that it gives them. I'm proud of them
[11:33.430 --> 11:39.430]  So you can store it in the fridge is the best way cool dry dark place it stores where well cold, you know
[11:39.430 --> 11:42.190]  I've never honestly stored any for too long
[11:42.190 --> 11:47.270]  I make the one to nine ratio and then I use the hundred milliliters in that you're correct
[11:47.270 --> 11:51.870]  And then I make the bottle of spray and then I spray the plant but then I use that again in three days
[11:51.870 --> 11:55.950]  I'm pour more of that into the container and when I spray I spray the shit out of the plant
[11:55.950 --> 11:57.950]  So I use the whole leader. I never
[11:57.990 --> 12:02.350]  Over the course of a feminized project. I don't have any left. I'll use that entire leader
[12:02.590 --> 12:05.310]  So I usually don't store it for very long
[12:05.310 --> 12:07.310]  I don't know how long it can be stored
[12:07.350 --> 12:12.830]  For me silver thiosulfate is super affordable super cheap to make it doesn't cost that much for 20 or 30 bucks
[12:12.830 --> 12:18.230]  You can make gallons of it. So I just make a fresh batch every time. I'm trying to make new feminized seeds
[12:18.430 --> 12:23.070]  I've got a batch mixed up now because I'm actually beginning to make some new seeds. That's a good segue, right guys
[12:23.070 --> 12:24.110]  We didn't talk about that
[12:24.110 --> 12:28.470]  I am starting to make more feminized seeds a lot of people are asking for
[12:28.790 --> 12:35.710]  The orange chasm the golden goats the lemon Jeffries and a couple of other things they are in the works you guys I have started
[12:35.710 --> 12:38.110]  That so give me a little bit of time. Don't rush me be patient
[12:38.110 --> 12:42.470]  Let me get it done correctly, but feminized seeds are coming. I know you want them
[12:42.470 --> 12:46.710]  I know they're in high demand people have practically been begging for the femme seeds. It takes a lot of time
[12:46.710 --> 12:50.070]  It takes a lot of space to make them. I did have other projects ahead of that
[12:50.310 --> 12:55.030]  There was a learning curve learning to adjust and breed in a whole room with LED lighting
[12:55.030 --> 13:00.590]  So, yeah, give me some patience and we'll get those femme seeds coming up there. They're in the works you guys
[13:00.590 --> 13:04.630]  All right, so you can store the silver thiosulfate in a cool dry dark place
[13:04.950 --> 13:07.390]  It's so cheap that I honestly just make more of it
[13:07.390 --> 13:13.830]  And I really don't store a lot of it because I use all of what I make to reverse the plants that I'm working
[13:13.830 --> 13:17.990]  What so I just make that one liter use that you're gonna use it for the next 20
[13:18.230 --> 13:21.990]  Honestly, I start reversing a plant sometimes up to two weeks before I'm gonna flip it
[13:21.990 --> 13:25.430]  So two weeks before flower it gets a spray a week before flower
[13:25.430 --> 13:31.230]  It gets a spray the day before flower it gets a spray then every three days for 21 days. It'll get a spray
[13:31.230 --> 13:33.230]  So I'm gonna spray it ten times ish
[13:33.390 --> 13:38.190]  Maybe a couple of more if if that plant takes a long time if it's a longer flowering sativa
[13:38.190 --> 13:42.550]  I'll spray it more times even into flower just to remind it. Hey, bitch. Don't go back to veg
[13:42.590 --> 13:45.490]  Keep making those flowering balls. Keep making pollen for me
[13:45.630 --> 13:49.590]  I'm just reminding it just giving it the the spray that it needs to keep doing that
[13:50.150 --> 13:54.470]  Encouraging it to keep producing pollen for me. So I spray it enough to where I use all of it
[13:54.470 --> 13:55.990]  I don't ever have any leftovers
[13:55.990 --> 14:00.030]  And then I just make more next time because it's very cost-effective if you're doing it correctly
[14:00.030 --> 14:02.030]  It is a very very cost-effective
[14:02.030 --> 14:07.270]  This is one of the most affordable ingredients that we can buy for the garden is making our own silver
[14:07.790 --> 14:13.070]  Thiosulfate so I think I covered most of that. What's the best place to store it? And what's the shelf life?
[14:13.070 --> 14:18.190]  I honestly don't know the exact shelf life because I've never it's never lasted me that long
[14:18.190 --> 14:22.550]  It's like asking me the shelf life of a life of cheesecake. I don't it's never lasted that long, dude
[14:22.630 --> 14:25.630]  Never gotten to that point. So I don't know
[14:25.630 --> 14:27.310]  I wish I could give you better info on that
[14:27.310 --> 14:30.870]  But I really I would be lying and making some shit up and that's not how I do the show
[14:30.870 --> 14:34.790]  So big respect. Thank you for the great question store it in the fridge
[14:35.430 --> 14:39.710]  Label it make sure everybody in the household knows that that stuff is not to drink with
[14:39.950 --> 14:45.630]  Not to drink not to make any food don't consume that then I think everything will go well for you and just make more dude
[14:45.670 --> 14:48.390]  It's super affordable. It's kind of fun to make it and then you know
[14:48.390 --> 14:52.930]  You have a fresh potent batch every time you work with it because it does lose quality over time
[14:52.990 --> 14:55.190]  Here's one thing to think about if it changes colors
[14:55.550 --> 14:59.590]  It's going bad if it start getting dark if you start seeing stuff floating in it
[14:59.710 --> 15:06.150]  If the lid of the jar starts turning dark purple, then it's probably time to replace that you don't want to use that product
[15:06.150 --> 15:12.110]  All right. Thank you for the question, bro. I look forward to some replies on this. All right. I do have another question
[15:12.110 --> 15:15.830]  Let's see. It says to read the one from Cincy. So we're gonna grab this one right here
[15:15.830 --> 15:17.390]  This one came from patreon
[15:17.390 --> 15:22.870]  This one came from a person who I called since he nasty and the last episode and they have been
[15:23.150 --> 15:29.630]  Asked they have asked me to call them since he loco or since he crazy so big shout out to my buddy since he crazy
[15:29.630 --> 15:33.150]  They asked why I called them since he nasty. I'll explain. I'm a sneakerhead
[15:33.150 --> 15:38.430]  I recently discovered some Nike dunk SB lows that said nasty boys on the back of them and
[15:38.630 --> 15:44.430]  They are made for the Cincinnati Reds team, I don't care or know too much about baseball no offense to baseball
[15:44.430 --> 15:45.950]  If that's your thing go for it. Yay team
[15:45.950 --> 15:47.990]  I'm very ignorant to sports and baseball
[15:47.990 --> 15:51.710]  But I love these shoes and I read about them to see why they said nasty boys on the back
[15:51.870 --> 15:55.270]  There's a Cincinnati Reds team from one year that there were three or four players
[15:55.270 --> 15:57.270]  They just kicked ass and took the team to the championship
[15:58.070 --> 16:00.730]  Go team go team, but that's why the shoes are called that
[16:00.730 --> 16:05.990]  So when I read the word since II I put nasty at the end of it because they were the Cincinnati Reds
[16:05.990 --> 16:09.150]  They were the nasty boys. That's where all that math came through in my head
[16:09.150 --> 16:11.310]  Hope I didn't offend you by calling you since he nasty
[16:11.310 --> 16:15.550]  Also, I have another friend who goes by since he nasty on Instagram
[16:15.550 --> 16:18.830]  So I think it was just embedded in my brain big shout out to my buddy since he nasty
[16:18.830 --> 16:22.910]  Hope you're well, bro. Haven't heard from you in a long time. He posts a lot of great graffiti pictures
[16:22.910 --> 16:28.150]  He does not do the graffiti. He posts the pictures you guys don't go painting shit. That's not yours unless you're really talented
[16:28.750 --> 16:35.590]  Alright, let's get focused read this message from my buddy since he loco or since he crazy this one goes like this
[16:35.590 --> 16:39.670]  Let me kind of find the the meat because there's a lot of stuff that's just for me and not for you guys in this
[16:39.670 --> 16:41.750]  One it says good evening great podcast this week
[16:41.750 --> 16:44.970]  I thought you did an amazing job of breaking down all of the questions
[16:44.970 --> 16:51.610]  So everyone can understand first of all, that is a huge compliment because I understand that not everybody learns in the same way
[16:52.030 --> 16:53.710]  I'm kind of a hands-on learner
[16:53.710 --> 16:54.550]  I hated school
[16:54.550 --> 16:59.550]  but I love to learn if that makes any sense if you're the kind of teacher that just sits there and reads from a book
[16:59.550 --> 17:02.110]  And expects me to follow along and then learn something
[17:02.270 --> 17:07.150]  I'm bored about a page and especially if you've got an annoying voice. I've already checked out
[17:07.150 --> 17:10.470]  I'm thinking about other stuff what I'm gonna do when I get out of your dumbass class
[17:10.790 --> 17:12.670]  If you're a fun entertaining teacher
[17:12.670 --> 17:16.990]  If you can let me touch some things and play with them and try to break stuff and rebuild it
[17:16.990 --> 17:22.030]  Then I'm gonna learn some shit. So I'm glad that you see that I try to teach from a lot of different angles
[17:22.030 --> 17:23.150]  That's why I kind of repeat myself
[17:23.150 --> 17:25.150]  That's why some things I beat it into the ground
[17:25.310 --> 17:32.190]  Because still some people I'll give I'll tell you a hundred times that day one is when you flip the plants to 1212
[17:32.190 --> 17:38.310]  That's day one and I'll still get 24 emails asking when is day one? So I've got to say things a lot of different ways
[17:39.270 --> 17:42.110]  All right, it's gonna go on it says it has been really cool
[17:42.110 --> 17:46.110]  I've got so he talks about a grow that he's working on that we've talked about then it says
[17:47.470 --> 17:50.910]  So he's doing a little bit of breeding and he's talking about his breeding project
[17:50.910 --> 17:52.870]  The main question is since these plants are autos
[17:52.870 --> 17:57.070]  I'm wondering is it better to have a taller plant with a lot of bud separation?
[17:57.070 --> 18:03.090]  So everything gets light or as a smaller bushier your plant better for THC production
[18:03.090 --> 18:09.950]  So he's asking about phenotypical expression of the shape of the plant and wondering which will give better THC
[18:10.510 --> 18:17.270]  Production now, unfortunately, I do not have an answer on that. Those are plants. I don't know the traits of those plants
[18:17.990 --> 18:22.470]  You could probably grow a hundred seeds of the cross that you made and you could find
[18:22.870 --> 18:29.530]  25 squat plants and 25 tall plants and you're going to find different ratios of cannabinoids through those phenotypes
[18:29.630 --> 18:31.470]  Especially since you've created
[18:31.470 --> 18:34.110]  It's not really it's kind of an f1. It's kind of a polyhybrid
[18:34.470 --> 18:39.750]  You're gonna find the eyes at polyhybrid. Excuse me for that. You're gonna find a huge mix of progeny in there
[18:40.230 --> 18:42.230]  So I'm really not sure
[18:42.230 --> 18:47.190]  Taller plant with a lot of bud separation so everything gets light or a smaller bushier plant
[18:47.630 --> 18:53.530]  Most people are going to prefer a shorter bushier plant if you're making seeds to share with people sell to people
[18:53.530 --> 18:55.530]  They're gonna want the shorter bushier plants
[18:55.590 --> 19:00.610]  Most people are growing indoors a large percent of the people growing indoors are growing in a tent
[19:00.610 --> 19:03.970]  Those people are gonna want shorter plants. It's just gonna make sense for them
[19:06.030 --> 19:12.130]  Sometimes they sacrifice that short bushy faster flowering time for the THC potency
[19:12.230 --> 19:17.570]  So they and I think they understand that I think that they know that that is part of the gamble in my opinion
[19:17.570 --> 19:22.510]  I think that you get a better potency from a photo period plant, but I don't have anything to back that up
[19:22.510 --> 19:26.610]  That's just from from what I've seen and I don't really have any science. Sorry. I'm talking out of my ass
[19:26.610 --> 19:27.990]  Let's get back to focus
[19:27.990 --> 19:31.690]  Then it says does this matter at all all of the autos will get you faded
[19:31.690 --> 19:35.430]  But not as heavily as the regular photo period plants we have grown
[19:35.430 --> 19:37.770]  So I think that statement backed up what I was just trying to say
[19:38.050 --> 19:42.490]  This person is growing autos and photos and he says those autos get him faded
[19:42.490 --> 19:48.830]  But not as much as the photo period plants that does make sense. The autos are kind of in a hurry those photo periods
[19:48.830 --> 19:49.410]  They got all day
[19:49.410 --> 19:53.630]  They're just gonna build up potency build up the hormones and the precursors to make that potency
[19:54.050 --> 19:58.290]  So I understand that now it says my goal has two parts with this project
[19:58.530 --> 20:02.750]  Goal one is to increase the THC and have plants that yield well
[20:03.170 --> 20:05.370]  So I guess that's number two is plants that yield
[20:05.370 --> 20:10.650]  Well, that's always a good goal high potency high yields. That's what everybody wants. You get a good lab test
[20:10.650 --> 20:14.850]  It looks good on the label looks good on the jar people want to buy it and smoke it and then if there's a lot
[20:14.850 --> 20:18.370]  Of it you can sell a lot of that shit and make some money. So that's always a good goal
[20:18.730 --> 20:25.350]  It says which Fino will help me reach that goal more quickly the tall Fino or the short Fino
[20:25.350 --> 20:27.810]  I really have no way to predict that
[20:27.810 --> 20:32.090]  I honestly don't have a way to predict that a couple of things you could do
[20:32.130 --> 20:37.210]  You could take the taller Fino and the shorter Fino and get a lab test of them
[20:37.330 --> 20:44.050]  Which one of them gives you a higher THC percentage then breed to that when you've obviously got a higher THC start
[20:44.410 --> 20:49.330]  So you've got that ingredient that you're looking for. It's dominant. You know, it's there use that one
[20:49.330 --> 20:54.850]  That is a very good way to set yourself up for success. You know, the ingredient you're looking for is there
[20:56.370 --> 20:59.890]  So what I would do I would select a male and I would pollinate
[21:00.090 --> 21:02.730]  Both of them and I know that sounds like a lot of work
[21:02.730 --> 21:09.090]  But you just put the one male plant next to your tall Fino next to your short Fino and you let them do their magic
[21:09.090 --> 21:11.690]  Right, let them finish get the seeds out of there
[21:11.690 --> 21:17.290]  The seeds are probably gonna take six to eight weeks to finish cut the both plants down label them tall and skinny and short and squatty
[21:17.290 --> 21:21.370]  Pull the seeds out grow as many of the seeds as you can from both of them
[21:21.930 --> 21:23.930]  grow those seeds under
[21:24.210 --> 21:27.610]  Scientifically controlled conditions grow 50 or a hundred
[21:28.050 --> 21:34.690]  Tall and lanky seeds and grow 50 to a hundred short and squatty seeds right next to each other feed them exactly the same
[21:34.770 --> 21:37.210]  Give them the same environment make it scientific
[21:37.770 --> 21:39.770]  Acts like you got two little kids in the room
[21:39.770 --> 21:43.650]  And if you give one one extra fucking cheese it they're gonna throw a fit
[21:43.650 --> 21:46.570]  Act like you got little kids in the room and feed them and treat them all
[21:46.970 --> 21:49.970]  Exactly the same and then see which do you like better?
[21:50.250 --> 21:54.370]  Maybe you're gonna find out that that THC isn't exactly what you're looking for
[21:54.370 --> 21:58.450]  Maybe one of them has a terp that really fucks you up and gets you right where you need to be
[21:58.450 --> 22:03.730]  It's not always about the THC. That's something really important to keep in mind. You may find a terpene
[22:03.730 --> 22:05.730]  You may find a cannabinoid combination
[22:05.810 --> 22:10.570]  You may find a few things that mix together in one of those phenotypes that really blast you
[22:10.730 --> 22:15.730]  Just the way you need to get blasted. Sometimes that's like what the breeders discover for ourselves
[22:15.730 --> 22:17.850]  We have the opportunity to breed and grow so many seeds
[22:17.850 --> 22:19.850]  We find something unique to ourselves
[22:19.890 --> 22:24.050]  Then we discover that when we share it, it's unique to a lot of people and they enjoy it as well
[22:24.170 --> 22:30.330]  So don't focus too much on finding THC focus on finding a very balanced plant a plant that grows
[22:30.330 --> 22:33.650]  Well a plant that produces well, and then it's got some turps
[22:33.690 --> 22:38.730]  What's the point of having a plant that grows a lot of buds and gets you really high if when you smoke it?
[22:38.730 --> 22:42.610]  It tastes like you're smoking burnt pubes. Nobody's gonna want to smoke that it's not enjoyable
[22:42.610 --> 22:47.290]  No matter how high it gets me probably not gonna smoke your buds that smell and taste like burnt pubes
[22:47.290 --> 22:52.410]  It's got to have some good turps to it some good aromas good flavors good bag appeal good colors
[22:52.410 --> 22:56.970]  It's got to be sticky. There are a lot of other things to think about that go along with that THC
[22:56.970 --> 23:01.090]  So I understand the desire for THC and high yield. That's what we want
[23:01.090 --> 23:02.610]  You want to get high and you want a lot of it, right?
[23:02.610 --> 23:07.630]  But you got to get some other things in there. Let me get myself back on track what I would do
[23:07.630 --> 23:11.410]  I would breed to both of those. I would take both of your plants pollinate them
[23:11.410 --> 23:14.050]  You've got seeds of both grow them both see what you like
[23:14.170 --> 23:19.410]  Here is something that you can do early on to help you decide how to move forward
[23:19.410 --> 23:21.810]  Have you ever thought about predicated testing?
[23:22.090 --> 23:27.530]  We can plant as many a population of seeds from both so you got short and squat cross to your male
[23:27.850 --> 23:31.430]  You got tall and skinny cross to your male. You got those seeds growing
[23:31.430 --> 23:34.530]  You can get little test kits that you can you basically
[23:34.770 --> 23:40.650]  Open up full unfold a matchbook and you rub part of the leaf tissue on the matchbook and you close it back up and then
[23:40.650 --> 23:47.010]  You put a number on it short and squat plant number two short and squat plant number three and continue label each one according to
[23:47.010 --> 23:50.210]  What plant number you've got you send those tests off to a laboratory?
[23:50.370 --> 23:55.090]  They can tell you if that plant is a male or a female which is a great thing to have
[23:55.090 --> 23:58.610]  We already can eliminate the plants. We don't need if we're looking for males and females
[23:58.650 --> 24:02.970]  They can also detect the presence of cannabinoid precursors
[24:03.010 --> 24:09.610]  Which means they can tell you if those plants later on in their life will develop high THC high CBD high
[24:10.090 --> 24:15.890]  THC V they can dictate and print and predict all of the cannabinoids that may be present in that plant
[24:15.890 --> 24:19.770]  They're in very very low concentrations and low ratios at this time
[24:19.930 --> 24:23.930]  But they know that if the presence of this cannabinoid and this other
[24:24.130 --> 24:26.570]  I'm not sure the detectors and the markers on the test
[24:26.570 --> 24:31.890]  But they can say this plant has potential for being a high THC potency plant
[24:31.890 --> 24:35.550]  They can tell you that when the plants are three four five or six inches tall
[24:35.550 --> 24:37.390]  So you don't have to waste a lot of time
[24:37.390 --> 24:42.270]  so if your main goal is for potency you can send in a lab test and
[24:42.590 --> 24:45.870]  This is this is kind of new science backwards breeding
[24:46.470 --> 24:50.470]  Be open-minded to this. This is a new way in a backwards way of doing it
[24:50.550 --> 24:58.150]  You can send in a lab test then they will send you back the numbers find the outliers within those populations
[24:58.150 --> 25:03.910]  So if you're looking for high THC and you've got 50 plants find the top 10 THC
[25:04.270 --> 25:07.830]  Plants in those tests and get rid of get rid of the other 40
[25:07.830 --> 25:13.410]  So you've got your 10 highest THC potency females left from each side now
[25:13.410 --> 25:19.690]  You just went from a hundred plants down to 20 and we know that these are all gonna be high THC highly potent plants
[25:19.830 --> 25:22.310]  Now we grow them we flower them out
[25:22.310 --> 25:25.430]  We finish them and now we look for all of the other traits
[25:25.430 --> 25:30.390]  Which we may desire to make those plants what we want for the market for ourselves
[25:30.390 --> 25:34.270]  We already know they're gonna have high THC now we find the one with the turps now
[25:34.270 --> 25:36.750]  We find the one that doesn't get powdery mildew now
[25:36.750 --> 25:38.910]  We find the one that grows the way we want it to grow
[25:39.150 --> 25:43.470]  Does it grow tall and skinny does it grow short and squat you find the one that works for you?
[25:43.470 --> 25:48.430]  Is there one that tastes amazing to a couple of them tastes like burnt pubes like we talked about earlier now
[25:48.430 --> 25:51.550]  You already know that what you've got is all high potency plants
[25:51.550 --> 25:56.630]  They're gonna have the potency you're looking for now. We just got to find the other markers in that population
[25:56.630 --> 26:03.430]  So that's another option is predicated testing to remove the outliers or include the outliers from a population
[26:03.430 --> 26:07.390]  Then select from those that will definitely minimize population quite quickly
[26:07.390 --> 26:13.390]  But if you don't have access and funding for that type of lab what you would do is grow them dude
[26:13.470 --> 26:17.430]  Grow them out just like any other pheno hunt and smoke them smoke them yourself
[26:17.870 --> 26:21.790]  Smoke them with your friends and see what turns heads and what gets attention
[26:21.790 --> 26:26.110]  You will know some stuff will definitely turn some heads some stuff will get ignored
[26:26.110 --> 26:30.110]  It may be completely different for you and your crew. I said earlier
[26:30.110 --> 26:32.670]  Maybe sometimes you'll create some shit that everybody goes dude
[26:32.670 --> 26:33.230]  What is that?
[26:33.230 --> 26:38.510]  like I've been at concerts before and lit up a joint and I've had everybody for 50 feet turn and look at me like what
[26:38.510 --> 26:44.230]  The fuck are you smoking? They've all wanted to buy seeds or buy an eighth off me. They all circled around like vultures
[26:44.270 --> 26:48.870]  That's how you know, you hit gold. Sometimes you light up some weed and you try to pass it to your friends and they go
[26:49.790 --> 26:53.030]  I'm good. That smells like you're smoking your fingernails over there
[26:53.830 --> 26:55.710]  Sometimes you smoke some shit that you're like
[26:55.710 --> 26:59.310]  I'm not super fond of this and you smoke it with one of your friends and they're like dude
[26:59.310 --> 27:02.550]  I've got this medical problem that I've had my whole life and when I smoke that shit
[27:02.550 --> 27:04.710]  I feel amazing and you're like when I smoked it
[27:04.710 --> 27:09.950]  I didn't notice anything there might be a terp a cannabinoid a compound in there that works beautifully for something
[27:09.950 --> 27:10.830]  They've got going on
[27:10.830 --> 27:15.630]  That's always beautiful to find because then you give them a clone of that plan or you give them seeds or whatever
[27:15.630 --> 27:17.630]  You're like here you go, buddy. That's your magic medicine
[27:17.630 --> 27:20.810]  Now that feels good that you've helped out a friend for the rest of their fucking life
[27:20.810 --> 27:25.670]  They found relief from something that bugged them for a long time. You didn't even know you made their medicine
[27:25.670 --> 27:28.230]  I've had that happen before big up to those people
[27:28.230 --> 27:31.030]  They know who they are, but the real answer here
[27:31.070 --> 27:37.550]  The only real way to know this is to grow out these seeds. I would cross the male to the shortened squat
[27:37.550 --> 27:43.390]  I would cross the male the selected male one male pick one dude that you really like pick one dude and
[27:43.630 --> 27:49.310]  Pollinate all of the plants the squatty and the tall one pollinate both of those with the same dude
[27:49.390 --> 27:55.630]  Get those seeds clearly label them and grow them both under the same conditions and see how you like that
[27:55.630 --> 27:59.850]  That's the only way to find out is to run the plants run the mix and see what you made
[28:00.030 --> 28:01.510]  Otherwise, you're just kind of guessing
[28:01.510 --> 28:06.030]  I have no way of telling you like which is gonna have higher THC by looking at these plants
[28:06.030 --> 28:11.190]  I would have to smoke it maybe run it through a lab. I don't have that ability and keep in mind again
[28:11.510 --> 28:16.230]  I know I've said this but I just want to stress this part because this we all get consumed by
[28:16.910 --> 28:21.630]  Lab reports and lab numbers and terpene reports and test results and all that shit
[28:21.710 --> 28:26.390]  But here's something that I said the other day in a live chat and all the growers in their life pretty hard
[28:26.390 --> 28:30.810]  I've never had a liquid chromatography machine come back and try to buy another bag
[28:31.430 --> 28:33.430]  No matter how high the lab report was
[28:33.910 --> 28:36.630]  None of those machines have ever called me and hit me up for another eighth
[28:36.750 --> 28:40.670]  Does that make any sense to you people buy weed we're not growing machine
[28:40.670 --> 28:46.870]  We're not growing weed for machines people smoke weed people smoke dabs not high-pressure liquid chromatography machines
[28:47.350 --> 28:50.750]  We can impress those machines very easily. I know how to manipulate a lab test
[28:50.750 --> 28:53.390]  We can get high fucking numbers if we really really wanted to push it
[28:53.390 --> 28:57.110]  We could really push it to where people are showing up at the grow going. What the fuck are you guys doing?
[28:57.110 --> 28:59.990]  We get CNN there. It wouldn't be hard to manipulate a lab test
[29:00.590 --> 29:06.590]  But what's the point like the numbers are just like if you smoke it and it doesn't get you where you want to be
[29:06.630 --> 29:11.750]  It could say a hundred percent THC on the label and it doesn't matter to me. It's got to have some turps
[29:11.750 --> 29:16.750]  It's got to have a few other things to get my attention. It's got to be tasty. I can smoke all the weed
[29:16.750 --> 29:21.030]  I want I live in Colorado. There's all the weed like I can go to the store and I could buy
[29:21.550 --> 29:25.630]  Two ounces today and two ounces tomorrow and if I can smoke two ounces by myself in a day
[29:25.630 --> 29:27.030]  I got to get better weed
[29:27.030 --> 29:30.790]  But my point is I can smoke all the weed we can get dabs and get edibles
[29:30.790 --> 29:34.870]  We can get as fucked up as we want. I need it to taste good. That's one of the most important parts to me
[29:34.870 --> 29:40.510]  I don't want to smoke bad tasting herb herb that burns my throat or herb that makes my tongue feel weird
[29:40.510 --> 29:43.510]  I'm not into it. Why smoke that shit when there's good shit
[29:43.510 --> 29:48.030]  So my point is I don't focus too much on the numbers because the machines aren't gonna come by another eighth
[29:48.030 --> 29:52.470]  The people are gonna come by another eighth and they're the ones that are gonna say damn that smells skunky
[29:52.470 --> 29:55.910]  Damn, that was super sticky. Damn that tastes like bubblegum and popsicles
[29:55.910 --> 30:00.270]  They're the ones that are gonna come back with some money not the machine. So don't focus too much on those numbers
[30:00.270 --> 30:04.030]  That's my main point here. Let me get my high ass back on track
[30:04.030 --> 30:06.030]  Obviously, I've been smoking something fucking good today
[30:06.550 --> 30:09.990]  Since he loco. Thank you for the great message, dude. I think I answered this honestly
[30:10.950 --> 30:12.990]  Which one will help me get to that goal quicker?
[30:12.990 --> 30:15.390]  I shouldn't harp too much on that part
[30:15.390 --> 30:21.750]  But when you're breeding don't focus on getting to the goal more quickly focus on getting the goal accurately
[30:21.990 --> 30:26.510]  There's no fast tracking and breeding doing it the fast way. We'll get you fucked up
[30:26.510 --> 30:28.110]  That's the way to fuck it all up do it the quick way
[30:28.110 --> 30:31.230]  So grow from your heart breathe with love and take your time man
[30:31.230 --> 30:35.270]  Put some love and art into your art put some love skills some passion and do it correctly
[30:36.310 --> 30:40.070]  It's only gonna you're gonna do two plants side by side. It's not gonna take you much longer
[30:40.070 --> 30:43.030]  The hard part will be growing both of them, but it's fun
[30:43.030 --> 30:46.750]  Then you get to compare you get to take a bunch of notes, which we're gonna talk about in a future episode
[30:46.750 --> 30:52.390]  All right, it goes on to say I prefer let's see since he loco or since he nasty would be preferred
[30:52.950 --> 30:54.950]  Then he asked what gave me the nasty vibe?
[30:55.830 --> 30:59.270]  Nothing to do with any of the things that you listed. I think I explained that a moment ago
[30:59.630 --> 31:02.310]  It all stemmed from a pair of shoes from the Cincinnati Reds
[31:03.070 --> 31:09.310]  Triggered my brain got the ADD going speaking of ADD. It is time to wrap up this podcast episode you guys since II
