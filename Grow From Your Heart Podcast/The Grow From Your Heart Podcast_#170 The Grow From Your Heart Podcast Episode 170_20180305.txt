[01:51.250 --> 01:55.410]  friends at handmade apparel, go to handmade apparel.biz because this part of the podcast
[01:55.410 --> 01:59.050]  is brought to you by our good friends at handmade apparel. You guys, my friends at handmade
[01:59.050 --> 02:03.170]  apparel made me some hoodies. They have the grow from your heart podcast logo right above
[02:03.490 --> 02:06.650]  the left breast. It doesn't have my face on it. And on the back, it's got the grow from
[02:06.650 --> 02:10.210]  your heart podcast logo with my big cheesy face on there. These hoodies are sweet. You
[02:10.210 --> 02:13.450]  guys, they look super cool. If you're interested in one, send me an email. I've gotten two
[02:13.450 --> 02:18.410]  emails so far. Uh, I took on a new project and I have not replied to many emails. I will
[02:18.410 --> 02:22.490]  get back to you probably after I record. So if you're interested in a hoodie, send me
[02:22.490 --> 02:26.090]  a message. Uh, Jesse picked up the hoodies and made the big cheesiest smile that I've
[02:26.090 --> 02:29.210]  seen in a long time. They're pretty cool. They're pretty cool. Like, and it's kind of
[02:29.210 --> 02:32.850]  weird to see a hoodie with my face on it, but people will be wearing them and I'll have
[02:32.850 --> 02:36.210]  to adjust. So big shout out to my hand, my friends at hand, big shout out to my hand.
[02:36.210 --> 02:39.370]  Yeah, that too. But also shout out to my friends at handmade apparel. This is going to be an
[02:39.370 --> 02:43.370]  interesting podcast. You guys, we've been taking some big fat dabs of some cascade shatter.
[02:43.370 --> 02:46.490]  Uh, it's going to be a fun show, but big shout out to my friends at handmade apparel. If
[02:46.490 --> 02:50.010]  you need some shirts made, if you need something printed, if you need stickers, if you need
[02:50.010 --> 02:55.690]  some hat pins made, go check out handmade apparel.biz. They're great people. Great folks.
[02:55.690 --> 02:59.410]  I love those guys. Hey, thanks for the hoodies. You guys, they look great. Said it once before,
[02:59.410 --> 03:03.890]  I can't get over that logo. It looks so sweet on a hoodie. Super, uh, super high quality
[03:03.890 --> 03:07.810]  printing. Isn't that printing smooth? It looks like they put a sticker on a hoodie. Yeah.
[03:07.810 --> 03:13.370]  Yeah. It's so clean. Especially once it ages a little dope as fuck. Jesse said, well, Jesse's
[03:13.370 --> 03:16.490]  kind of into the punk rock thing. So once it fades and it doesn't look brand new, is
[03:16.490 --> 03:19.970]  that when you're going to like it when it doesn't look so fresh and clean. All right.
[03:19.970 --> 03:24.370]  Yeah, I understand that. You gotta, gotta wear it. Gotta go spill some beer on it. Uh,
[03:24.370 --> 03:27.530]  let's see. What else did I want to make sure to mention something I thought about the other
[03:27.530 --> 03:32.530]  day on the podcast, and I'm sure that Jesse will, uh, will agree with what I'm going to
[03:32.530 --> 03:35.050]  say. There was another word I was trying to, trying to find, but I can't find the word
[03:35.050 --> 03:41.690]  you guys. I owe you a huge thank you for trusting me. You guys listen to me and I give you advice
[03:41.690 --> 03:46.490]  about your cannabis plants, which are used for your medicine to keep you healthy or in
[03:46.490 --> 03:50.490]  another way to keep your wallet fat. However, it's happening. I'm helping you out and you
[03:50.490 --> 03:55.890]  trust me with your financial and your medicinal investment and your time and your energy.
[03:55.890 --> 03:59.450]  I trust what I say and that means a lot to me. So thank you for trusting me and thanks
[03:59.450 --> 04:04.170]  for, uh, for trusting me. That's it. Thanks for believing that my guidance is correct
[04:04.170 --> 04:07.690]  and thanks for believing in me. Thanks for supporting the podcast. That's just cool as
[04:07.690 --> 04:10.970]  shit. I realized the other day that there are a lot of people out there that say, I
[04:10.970 --> 04:14.810]  have a question about cannabis, ask Ross to Jeff. So just thanks for believing in me and
[04:14.810 --> 04:18.630]  trusting me to guide you through your garden. All right. I think that's enough rambling
[04:18.630 --> 04:23.810]  for the start of the podcast. Uh, Jesse's here and he wanted to talk about composting.
[04:23.810 --> 04:28.930]  He sent me a message and he said, I have had composting on my head all day. And I said,
[04:28.930 --> 04:34.850]  I don't think compost is quite what's in your head, but it's close. So here we are. We're
[04:34.850 --> 04:39.330]  going to talk a little bit about composting. Um, yeah. Where do you want to start, bro?
[04:39.330 --> 04:45.730]  Do you want to jump right into it with anything? Um, hell, I don't even know where to start.
[04:45.730 --> 04:50.770]  Okay. Well, the first note that I took was Bokashi. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Let's do it
[04:50.770 --> 04:59.330]  that way. So Bokashi is for anyone that's not familiar. Um, it is a grain that has been
[04:59.330 --> 05:07.010]  inoculated with an EM one culture and indigenous microorganism. Yes. Yes. Um, do you know how
[05:07.010 --> 05:13.010]  that's done? Um, yeah, pretty much. I think they spray like a barley. You soak or soak
[05:13.010 --> 05:19.810]  it. Okay. With possibly a dairy product. Um, that's how you end up with the EM one fermented
[05:19.810 --> 05:27.410]  milk. Okay. So you take a culture, you collect and you mix it with milk and it, uh, it ferments
[05:28.050 --> 05:34.210]  and that's how you end up with what they call labs. Uh, lactic acid bacteria. Correct. Okay.
[05:34.210 --> 05:40.450]  Um, and from that, you can turn that into EM one and you can take the EM one, inoculate your grain,
[05:41.250 --> 05:49.010]  ferment it again, um, let it dry out and boom, you've got Bokashi grain. Okay. So
[05:49.090 --> 05:52.130]  are you making the Bokashi or are you buying the Bokashi pre-made?
[05:52.130 --> 05:59.730]  Um, I'm getting the Bokashi right now from Victor, um, with innovative organics up in Denver. Okay.
[05:59.730 --> 06:09.730]  Um, it's really good and it's pretty damn cheap. So, and he's a small local business that is, um,
[06:11.810 --> 06:17.010]  that's taken food out of the, you know, landfills. Oh, cool. Very cool. So it's.
[06:17.570 --> 06:20.930]  So let's, well, let's teach the people about the Bokashi bucket a little bit then, since you said
[06:20.930 --> 06:24.930]  taking food out of the landfills, that's going to make people have a lot of questions. Uh, I've got
[06:24.930 --> 06:29.650]  a Bokashi bucket. I can see one from where we're sitting, so it'll be advantageous to describe it.
[06:29.650 --> 06:34.690]  It's basically a five gallon bucket with a spigot on it. Uh, there's a little collection tray in the
[06:34.690 --> 06:40.130]  bottom that prevents the solid particles from getting in the way of the spigot. And basically
[06:40.930 --> 06:45.490]  ice fill that thing with my vegetable scraps. I don't eat any meat products. So all my vegetable
[06:45.490 --> 06:50.130]  scraps, the tips of my carrots, uh, the ends of my avocados, the avocado pits go in there and
[06:50.130 --> 06:55.250]  they disintegrate completely stuff that, uh, goes to waste. Yeah. Anything I would throw away. It's
[06:55.250 --> 06:59.010]  sitting near the trash can to encourage me instead of putting it in the trash, it goes in the Kashi
[06:59.010 --> 07:03.730]  bucket. I fill it up. Uh, I fill up a bowl, like a glass bowl. And then I dumped that glass bowl
[07:03.730 --> 07:07.490]  into the Bokashi bucket. Cause it's much easier that way. And I don't have to open it as frequently
[07:07.490 --> 07:12.210]  because it smells like hell. Yeah. It's a, so you've got a five gallon bucket with a lid that
[07:12.210 --> 07:18.210]  seals on it. It's got a spigot. Um, I usually put a little layer, a thin layer of newspaper in there
[07:18.210 --> 07:23.490]  just to prevent a good idea. Cause some of that particle stuff will clog up the drain thing. So
[07:23.490 --> 07:28.050]  you put, uh, put the paper down and then you, I just put like a couple of banana peels. I honestly,
[07:28.050 --> 07:30.850]  in there to get started, cause I ate a shit ton of, I used to eat a shit ton of bananas,
[07:30.850 --> 07:33.890]  two banana peels in there to get it started. Then a handful of the Bokashi grain,
[07:34.450 --> 07:39.090]  because that is a bio activator. And then you just start throwing your, all your scrap in there. And
[07:39.090 --> 07:43.810]  then once you get a nice layer, maybe an inch or two thick, then just put a little, another handful
[07:43.810 --> 07:50.130]  of that Bokashi grain on there and repeat. Just make a lasagna basically of scraps, Kashi scraps,
[07:50.130 --> 07:55.730]  Kashi. I think it's an inch and a half that they say to put in. Yeah. So every inch and a half
[07:55.730 --> 08:00.850]  throw in more Bokashi grain and don't press it down you guys. Cause it's going to expand in there.
[08:00.850 --> 08:05.330]  No, you do want to press it. You do want to press it down. Get the air out. All the oxygen. Okay.
[08:05.330 --> 08:10.290]  Yeah. All right. So, uh, most Bokashi buckets come with a little, that little masher thing.
[08:10.290 --> 08:14.770]  Oh, it's when you push it down that it farts and makes that horrific smell. Yes. Correct. Okay.
[08:14.770 --> 08:21.970]  And it's also, you can squeeze a shit ton of, uh, of Chile or the leachate juice. Yeah. Yeah.
[08:21.970 --> 08:26.210]  Have you ever tried to clean a drain with that juice? I actually just tried it the other day.
[08:26.210 --> 08:31.330]  Did work for you? No, but it's pretty fucking clogged. Okay. All right. I poured, I even made
[08:31.330 --> 08:37.090]  sure I had enough. Um, I poured fuck like a half gallon in there. Oh wow. Yeah. That should have
[08:37.090 --> 08:41.250]  unclogged. If that's like a hair clog, that would have done it. You got something serious in there.
[08:41.250 --> 08:47.490]  What'd you eat boy? It's just a sink. All right. So you make your little lasagna, then you pack it
[08:47.490 --> 08:52.370]  down and then you seal it up and just leave it in there. And then after about 10 or 12 days,
[08:52.370 --> 08:57.170]  it'll start making juice and you can open up the little spigot and I use a glass Mason jar to catch
[08:57.170 --> 09:01.250]  the juice and then I seal it up and then I cover it with honestly with just a rag to keep it dark
[09:01.250 --> 09:06.930]  because you want to keep that away from the light. Uh, and then I put about, uh, an ounce per five
[09:06.930 --> 09:11.650]  gallon bucket. When I go to mix up some nutrients, put about an ounce of that crap in there and a
[09:11.650 --> 09:16.610]  five gallon bucket with my new tonight can see the plants start uptaking much better. And when I,
[09:16.610 --> 09:20.770]  I'll go ahead. It's just full of nutrients. It's all the nutrients from the plant.
[09:20.770 --> 09:26.450]  Right. I mean, it's just that that's all I'm using now in, in micro. That's amazing. Even,
[09:26.450 --> 09:31.730]  uh, at the big growth, we've started using it quite a bit and it will save on trash,
[09:31.730 --> 09:37.490]  yeah. Save on nutrient money. It's full of humic acids, fulvic acids, lactic acids.
[09:38.050 --> 09:44.050]  Um, it's got bacteria and fungi in it. A lot of the things that you probably forgot about and that
[09:44.050 --> 09:49.250]  your bottled nutrient company probably missed also. Yeah. It'll speed up the root zone, speed
[09:49.250 --> 09:53.170]  up the metabolism of your plants. So this is just the Bokashi bucket. You can get that lactic acid,
[09:53.170 --> 09:56.770]  bacteria juice out of there. So it'll start growing this white, funky foam,
[09:57.490 --> 10:03.090]  these big, gross looking brainy bubbles. That is perfect. You want that. If that's happening,
[10:03.090 --> 10:07.810]  you did it perfectly. Keep that going because once you've drained it a few times, I mean,
[10:07.810 --> 10:11.250]  you can drain it a lot of times. You can leave it going and keep draining it and mash it and
[10:11.250 --> 10:15.650]  drain it and mash it. It'll go for a long time. But eventually what I like to do after I've
[10:15.650 --> 10:22.050]  harvested, I'll take my old dirt and pour it into a big, uh, like a, a big R it's like a feed trough
[10:22.050 --> 10:27.090]  for horses. I think pour all the dirt into there. Then I'll pour that Bokashi bucket into there,
[10:27.090 --> 10:31.730]  all that funk and mix it in and mix that in with my dirt and cover it and put a little moisture
[10:31.730 --> 10:36.770]  in there. And then it spreads. And I feel like that stuff, the, whatever I made in the Kashi
[10:36.770 --> 10:41.730]  bucket grows throughout my soil at that point. Just go stirred occasionally. And then I'll try
[10:41.730 --> 10:46.930]  to do it. I'll try to get two full Bokashi buckets in there by the, before I go start to reuse it.
[10:47.890 --> 10:54.450]  Man, the smell is intense. We got an empty one out. It kind of smells like somebody threw up
[10:54.450 --> 10:57.970]  in the bar trash can after drinking all day. Yeah, that's a good way to describe it. It's
[10:57.970 --> 11:05.010]  sort of rotten milk. So they ate ice cream and then drank all day and then threw up in the bar
[11:05.010 --> 11:09.970]  trash can. Oh fuck. That's what it, that's seriously, it's bad. You can just drain a little,
[11:09.970 --> 11:13.970]  Mike can't be around it. Uh, white Mike that's on the podcast often. He can't, he's like, Oh,
[11:13.970 --> 11:17.250]  if you're going to do that, I'm fucking going home. Like he won't even be here.
[11:17.250 --> 11:21.090]  The guys at work love it. When I, uh, when I fill a res with it,
[11:22.450 --> 11:26.370]  yummy, I've seen, uh, the Bokashi people on Instagram. Actually, there's actually a company
[11:26.370 --> 11:32.370]  called Bokashi. They use 55 gallon drums of the mixture and then they use a forklift to lift it
[11:32.370 --> 11:38.770]  up and dump it. And I can just imagine what that smells like. Just 55 gallons of dead body.
[11:38.770 --> 11:44.370]  Victor's doing the same thing in Denver with the innovative organics. Okay. Yeah. That's,
[11:45.010 --> 11:49.890]  um, fuck. What was I going to say? Oh, when you were talking about putting a lot of banana
[11:49.890 --> 11:57.650]  pills in there. So cool thing about boat or doing this process is the compost that the Bokashi will
[11:57.650 --> 12:05.730]  eventually make the pulp itself. Um, and the leachate from it are both, they contain the
[12:05.730 --> 12:12.770]  nutrients that the plants contained. Um, and bananas for instance, are super high in potassium.
[12:13.650 --> 12:21.090]  Um, so if you want a custom tuned Bokashi juice, I mean, you know, look at the nutrients that are
[12:21.090 --> 12:27.090]  in the plant. If you filled that thing with, uh, um, with bananas and banana pills, I guarantee
[12:27.090 --> 12:33.490]  it'd be high in fuck guaranteed. Yep. Yeah. If you put, uh, berries that are darker in colors,
[12:33.490 --> 12:36.850]  we're going to have a whole bunch of like humics and stuff like that. And then I assume,
[12:37.410 --> 12:43.250]  yeah. Okay. So you've got your Bokashi bucket. You got this whole fuzzy white mess of stuff.
[12:43.250 --> 12:48.770]  You've got jars of lactic acid bacteria. Uh, then you said your next thing that you got going
[12:48.770 --> 12:55.170]  was your worm program. Let's talk about your worms. So I started with a hundred worms, uh,
[12:55.170 --> 13:01.410]  back in the summer, um, uh, potential vendor, um, brought them in and just gave them to me.
[13:01.490 --> 13:07.890]  And I was like, nice, nice. So red Wigglers. Yeah. Just red Wigglers. It was a hundred of them
[13:07.890 --> 13:14.530]  in like a, you know, like, uh, yeah, exactly. All right. Um, so I took it home and dumped them in
[13:14.530 --> 13:21.810]  a smart pot full of, uh, food scraps. Initially. Um, I put it just straight peat moss in there.
[13:21.810 --> 13:27.330]  Um, cause that's something they eat. Um, and I also did, I think some newspaper then,
[13:27.970 --> 13:33.650]  and I kept them through the summer. Um, I wasn't like real actively feeding them or anything,
[13:33.650 --> 13:40.130]  but now that winter's came around, um, I took, I think it's a 40 gallon container
[13:41.250 --> 13:47.970]  and filled it with all the worm or, uh, you know, all the stuff necessary for a good proper setup of
[13:47.970 --> 13:55.330]  worm bedding. And I've been dumping the, uh, uh, Bokashi pulp in there and they go fucking nuts
[13:55.330 --> 14:01.010]  for that shit, but I've got, so, I mean, I'm just, it's, it's cool as fuck. I'm making all
[14:01.010 --> 14:05.970]  my nutrients at home. Basically. We, we toss a little bit about what's in your worm bedding.
[14:06.530 --> 14:12.930]  Yeah. So I, you, I got some used phone books or, well, I think all phone books are used. I don't
[14:12.930 --> 14:16.850]  even know why the fuck they still make them. It's true. Just a waste of trees. Yeah. It's
[14:16.930 --> 14:24.130]  worm food. I shredded them up and a bunch of newspapers. Um, I used wood chips.
[14:25.330 --> 14:30.610]  Um, I have a comfrey plant at home, so that's indoors. So I went ahead and chopped all of that.
[14:30.610 --> 14:34.690]  Maybe like a, so they're going to turn that up for you and turn that into usable nutrients,
[14:34.690 --> 14:41.490]  okay. Which that's a whole nother, um, part of my little homestead style, growing the comfrey that
[14:41.490 --> 14:49.810]  is. Um, but, uh, I put some of that in there and then, uh, a full bucket of Bokashi stuff.
[14:49.810 --> 14:54.290]  Wow. They're going to love all that. And I figured out, so the Bokashi stinks like hell
[14:54.290 --> 15:02.290]  when it's in a open worm bin. Um, so this time I put a whole bunch of, uh, wood, a thick layer
[15:02.290 --> 15:07.090]  wood chips on the top and then a bunch of wet newspaper to seal it all up. Kind of trap it in
[15:07.330 --> 15:12.450]  and the smell went like, I can't even smell it. Okay. That's helpful. Yeah. In the winter like
[15:12.450 --> 15:16.450]  this, it's cold. You guys, it's probably 12 degrees here in Colorado, maybe lower. I'm,
[15:16.450 --> 15:21.410]  I don't want to go find out. Yeah. It's been hanging around like 15, 20 degrees easy.
[15:21.410 --> 15:25.170]  Tonight. It's going to get stupid cold in my garage. I'm guessing it's going to be in the
[15:25.170 --> 15:30.930]  teens. Would I be able to keep my 40 gallon worm life container in the garage right now?
[15:31.010 --> 15:38.850]  Um, you know, I don't really know. Okay. Um, I have a similar situation, but my garage is heated.
[15:38.850 --> 15:45.250]  So, um, it's around 65 degrees and they don't give it like, you would almost think, I would
[15:45.250 --> 15:50.050]  assume that that dirt is going to be hot anyway, because it's bioactive in there. Yeah. That's
[15:50.050 --> 15:55.890]  like the, the little warm farm I have most definitely it, it creates its own heat. It's
[15:55.890 --> 16:02.770]  more established. Uh, the big one, I just set that up, um, last weekend. So I'm sure it will
[16:03.330 --> 16:10.450]  start heating up, but I'm not going to like just say, Oh yeah, you'll be fine. So one thing I would
[16:10.450 --> 16:15.650]  for sure do is lift it off the floor. Okay. So that's get it off that cold. Your plants want
[16:15.650 --> 16:21.330]  to be off that cold concrete really sucks for plants unless it's a real fancy heated floor,
[16:21.330 --> 16:26.130]  right? It gets so cold. So cold, so fast. It's a heat sink. It actually stills
[16:26.850 --> 16:32.690]  heat out of things that are sitting on it. So, Oh, wow. I never thought of that. Yeah.
[16:32.690 --> 16:36.690]  Well, like when you're drunk and you lay in the bathtub to cool down. Yeah. I haven't done that
[16:36.690 --> 16:41.490]  shit in so long, but that was the first, first thing I could think of. Yeah. Wow. Okay. I remember
[16:41.490 --> 16:45.810]  those days. All right. So you've got your Bokashi, you got your worms and you're using a big 40 gallon
[16:45.810 --> 16:52.130]  container. Uh, how, what else is going into your compost? Um, just kitchen scraps at this point.
[16:52.130 --> 16:59.570]  Um, once spring comes around and it's not cold as fuck. Uh, when I get my outdoor compost pile
[16:59.570 --> 17:06.370]  going, I'll be putting all the chicken bedding in there. Um, that's mixed with chicken shit. Okay.
[17:06.370 --> 17:13.650]  Um, and do you put like meat products in there also? No. Um, it, I mean, you can in Bokashi,
[17:13.650 --> 17:19.490]  but, or they say you can actually saw somebody, the Bokashi people put their entire Thanksgiving
[17:19.490 --> 17:24.290]  dinner, their Turkey, like the carcass of the uneaten Turkey, the mashed potatoes,
[17:24.290 --> 17:27.890]  they put the entire thing in there and then they showed the process. They, and then they took a,
[17:27.890 --> 17:31.650]  the thing outside and dug a hole and buried it. And then they planted a tree on top of where
[17:31.650 --> 17:35.090]  they buried it. So that's how they did it. But they, they claimed they could put meat in there
[17:35.090 --> 17:40.210]  as well. It just took a little longer. They even say you can put feces in there. Um, things I'm
[17:40.210 --> 17:46.210]  not brave enough to do and things I'm not going to do for my indoor pot garden. Um, if I had a
[17:46.210 --> 17:53.010]  big, huge, gigantic outdoor garden, that would be it. End of the world scenario. Oh yeah. Yeah. But,
[17:53.010 --> 17:58.130]  um, even dairy, uh, cheese and stuff like that. They say you can do put eggshells in there too.
[17:58.130 --> 18:04.210]  Oh yeah. I totally, I totally put eggshells in there. Yeah. Coffee grounds. Um, even paper.
[18:04.210 --> 18:10.370]  I mean, it's like coffee filters, newspaper, stuff like that. So, oh yeah. It just eats that
[18:10.370 --> 18:15.970]  right up. That stuff just disappears. Yeah. You don't get a lot of leachate off of it, but, um,
[18:15.970 --> 18:22.130]  also I've been putting, uh, all my, all my cannabis scraps in them. So I've been, um,
[18:22.770 --> 18:29.410]  when you run them through, if I was to throw like the leaves and stuff off my plants in the garden
[18:29.490 --> 18:38.370]  into the open warm bin, I would lose most of the nitrogen. Um, and fuck what else? And I would lose
[18:38.370 --> 18:45.010]  carbon through the CO2 that it admits as it dries out and breaks down. Okay. Running them through
[18:45.010 --> 18:51.010]  the Bokashi bucket. You retain all of that. Wow. Okay. Because it ferments at first and it traps
[18:51.010 --> 18:56.770]  it in the plant. So then it's, it's healthier food for the worms and it makes a higher quality
[18:56.850 --> 19:02.210]  product. It's just richer, much richer. Okay. That fermentation is what gives it that amazing
[19:02.210 --> 19:09.250]  smell. Yeah. That's Victor's been teaching me about the wonders of Bokashi. Shout out to Victor.
[19:09.250 --> 19:13.650]  It seems like he knows what he's talking about. Um, he, uh, we totally get him on the show one
[19:13.650 --> 19:18.530]  of these days. Victor, you're invited to be on the phone. Okay. We can, I can, I've got a zoom age six.
[19:18.530 --> 19:22.690]  We'll go to wherever he is. Nice. If he's in Colorado. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's up in Denver. Oh
[19:22.690 --> 19:27.570]  yeah. We'll go to Denver. We'll see. We've got a huge warehouse full of fucking Bokashi buckets.
[19:27.570 --> 19:30.210]  We'll just go sit on a bucket. We'll all get a Bokashi bucket. It's a chair.
[19:32.370 --> 19:38.130]  When you're a ganja grower smells kind of funky. Sometimes is it a sickeningly
[19:38.130 --> 19:42.450]  satisfying thing? Like that smells terrible. I'll take five gallons of it.
[19:45.010 --> 19:50.210]  You know that that's going to make it like fish hydro slates and like Bokashi juice.
[19:50.210 --> 19:55.650]  And remember Nirvana and piranha or what was it? A piranha and tarantula from advanced nutrients
[19:55.650 --> 19:59.730]  when they made the liquids. Oh, those things smelled like the women's bathroom at the park
[19:59.730 --> 20:05.170]  in the middle of the summer. It was so terrible. They worked. You could feed your plants very little
[20:05.170 --> 20:09.650]  of those things and your plants would just go apeshit. I never used them. Yeah. I I'll admit
[20:09.650 --> 20:13.090]  it back in the day I used all of the advanced nutrients product. I didn't know any better.
[20:13.090 --> 20:19.810]  It's one I've never tried. I just, yeah. Not, not to bash anything, but that's one that I would avoid.
[20:20.130 --> 20:25.410]  It did. They promise you that you'll get 30% heavier yields, which it did. It gave me probably
[20:25.410 --> 20:31.170]  30% fatter yields than any other brand I've ever used. But all of my different strains looked,
[20:31.170 --> 20:37.970]  smelled and tasted the exact same. Yep. And they were all about, I hypothetically, if all those
[20:37.970 --> 20:43.970]  strains hit 30% THC with my regular regimen, they all hit about 2025 when I used advanced nutrients,
[20:43.970 --> 20:47.970]  but they were heavier. There was a lot more of it. It just wasn't. And I'd rather have,
[20:48.930 --> 20:53.330]  I'd rather grow a pound and a half of super dank than two pounds of me.
[20:54.610 --> 21:00.370]  They are, um, extremely overpriced. And I can tell you that working with them as a vendor
[21:00.930 --> 21:06.050]  and a company, they are fucking nightmare. Every hydro shop that I've tried to mess with has said
[21:06.050 --> 21:09.810]  that because I would be like, Hey, can you order this new advanced nutrients product? And people
[21:09.810 --> 21:13.250]  just shake their heads and be like, Nope, I'll take what they send me. They send me boxes of
[21:13.250 --> 21:18.290]  shit. I sell that stuff. There's no asking. Oh yeah. You replaced them with psycho, right?
[21:18.290 --> 21:23.490]  Yeah. Uh, I did a side by I've done a lot of side by sides. The show just got off on a way side
[21:23.490 --> 21:28.770]  track. I did not prefer psycho either. Uh, psycho gave me a lot of great colors. It gave me bud
[21:28.770 --> 21:32.690]  density and it gave me weight, but I did not approve of the flavor. The flavor was where it
[21:32.690 --> 21:39.250]  was lacking. Everything tasted like grape Kool-Aid. That seems to be how, um, how all those
[21:39.250 --> 21:45.010]  multi-part lines, right? If the bottles look like clear with different dyes in them,
[21:45.010 --> 21:48.450]  it's all probably in my opinion, I don't know this for sure. I should research this. They
[21:48.450 --> 21:52.210]  probably all came from one factory and they just get poured into different bottles and get different
[21:52.210 --> 21:58.690]  names put on them. Yeah. Something or something similar. I, um, as a rule of thumb, when you're,
[21:58.690 --> 22:03.410]  this is just my opinion, but as a rule of thumb, when you're shopping for a nutrient line,
[22:03.410 --> 22:08.930]  try to stick with an American made nutrient. Yeah. Those are by far the best quality. Um,
[22:09.330 --> 22:17.890]  avoid Dutch nutrients, uh, Dutch growers grow a completely different way than most Americans
[22:18.530 --> 22:24.690]  and the nutrients are formulated differently and they don't really work well with the way most
[22:24.690 --> 22:30.050]  American growers grow. I agree with most of that. Uh, I have seen some great results though with a
[22:30.050 --> 22:36.370]  couple of those Dutch brands, but, uh, Mills, if you follow the recipe. Okay. See now. Yeah. Okay.
[22:36.370 --> 22:39.970]  Then I can think of three brands that I would almost buy their products if it came down to it.
[22:39.970 --> 22:45.010]  There's, I mean, housing garden is Canada. Oh yeah. Canada is Dutch. We don't carry them. That's
[22:45.010 --> 22:52.130]  such a great product. And, uh, playground. Uh, that's an old ass company. Yeah. That's some good
[22:52.130 --> 22:56.290]  shit though. From back in the day. I know a few people that are diehard. Yeah. We can get that.
[22:56.290 --> 23:01.730]  Yeah. We order it for a couple of guys. Okay. But you're right though about, I've, I've got a note
[23:01.730 --> 23:07.410]  somewhere that says to talk about Dutch, uh, the Dutch bred cannabis to be a pussy, like, because
[23:07.410 --> 23:13.650]  their grow rooms, like the way I see it, cannabis, uh, happens on a Rocky mountain in Afghanistan,
[23:13.650 --> 23:19.170]  where a goat pissed on it, the wind beat the shit out of it. The sun beat down on it. There's a
[23:19.170 --> 23:22.930]  likelihood that a rock fell on it. You know what I mean? On the, on the, on the side of the Cush
[23:22.930 --> 23:28.850]  mountains in Afghanistan, a lot of shit still super growth. Actually a rabbit lives under it.
[23:28.930 --> 23:33.490]  Like it's covered in bugs. Shit goes wrong. Uh, I don't remember what the fuck my rant was all
[23:33.490 --> 23:37.010]  about now. Uh, Dutch. There we go. There we go. Thank you. So I had a brain injury. You guys,
[23:37.010 --> 23:40.850]  sometimes I forget what the fuck I'm saying. Uh, but so then the Dutch, uh, the Dutch got a hold
[23:40.850 --> 23:44.210]  of these plants and like, we want to grow them indoors. I have no idea what a fucking Dutch
[23:44.210 --> 23:46.930]  accent would sound like if I tried to do it. It's like, we want to grow these indoors and they
[23:46.930 --> 23:51.250]  wanted to find the best shit. They bred it to be these really skinny sticks that grow really perfect
[23:51.250 --> 23:57.890]  buds. And now it's like roses. It's like tulips. Yep. And I think that's Dutch is all about the
[23:57.890 --> 24:03.650]  flower industry. So they, they grow exactly. And over here in Colorado, California, the States that
[24:03.650 --> 24:08.370]  are catching on, we want to grow dank, robust plants. We understand about full plant health.
[24:08.370 --> 24:14.850]  We're breeding for complete plant structure, not just tulips with a fuck. Most of the time I can
[24:14.850 --> 24:23.570]  pick out a Dutch strain or genetics from Dutch or from Dutch, from Amsterdam. Um, with, I mean,
[24:23.570 --> 24:29.890]  roll a joint and smoke it, you know, put two or roll three joints, put two American strains in one
[24:29.890 --> 24:35.170]  from Amsterdam in there. And, uh, I guarantee I'll be able to pick out the, the whitewashed,
[24:35.810 --> 24:42.850]  uh, just completely blended. Everything tastes the same berries and flowers. No bud structure.
[24:43.970 --> 24:47.730]  Okay. I don't want to go bash every Dutch seat company, but I mean,
[24:48.290 --> 24:51.330]  man, I'm just hitting guys hard. Also avoid
[24:54.130 --> 24:59.410]  and don't shop here either. And then ban this website. All right. But yes, I think the Dutch
[24:59.410 --> 25:03.490]  have kind of wheat and you know, some American breeders are probably susceptible and guilty of
[25:03.490 --> 25:08.850]  it also. Uh, they probably bred because we wanted to find back in the day, we didn't have a high
[25:08.850 --> 25:13.810]  pressure sodium lamp or an led. We probably were using whatever finagle lamp we can put together
[25:13.890 --> 25:18.050]  in the garage to make some space, to try to create a 12, 12 flower cycle out of the few
[25:18.050 --> 25:21.570]  seeds that we did get from whatever we, we got that we didn't know where it came from.
[25:21.570 --> 25:25.890]  But some dude told us was tie stick, but it was probably from Mexico, but we thought it was cool.
[25:25.890 --> 25:30.370]  We're to tell our friends it was Jamaican. So you don't mean like, yeah, you're growing these
[25:30.370 --> 25:34.690]  fucking maybe tie stick, maybe Columbia, maybe Jamaican seeds that could be males could be
[25:34.690 --> 25:39.250]  females could be who knows what it is. And they got to figure out how to grow that. So we may have
[25:39.250 --> 25:42.770]  gotten rid of the good shit back in the day. Cause we didn't have the right lights. We didn't have
[25:42.770 --> 25:46.610]  the right knowledge. We just wanted something that finished quick and didn't climb up into the
[25:46.610 --> 25:52.210]  lights. I grew for three years before I ever saw a clone or even made one. So you just did a bunch
[25:52.210 --> 25:57.970]  of seeds. Yeah. Wow. I would kill to have some of that shit. I grew back. Oh yeah. I thought about
[25:57.970 --> 26:02.530]  how many, uh, I used to buy Mexican swag weed back in the day where I live. Mexican swag weed was
[26:02.530 --> 26:07.410]  four 50, $500 a pound. It was everywhere. And you could get a half ounce of seeds out of it. That
[26:07.410 --> 26:12.450]  looked like good, healthy, viable seeds. I almost wonder what I would have gotten from them because
[26:12.450 --> 26:18.770]  you know, those Mexican crops weren't producing a low yielding strain. Um, remember the lime green
[26:18.770 --> 26:23.490]  Christmas bud? Yes. I grew out some seats. How did that come out? It was lime green Christmas.
[26:24.130 --> 26:29.810]  So it was just a guarantee that it was like touch genetics. Here we go again. Some Dutch auto
[26:29.810 --> 26:34.530]  flowers. It's something like that. I mean, it was just, it was all right. We'd, you know,
[26:35.090 --> 26:38.770]  10 years ago would have went fucking head over heels for it. Yeah. It's funny that you call it
[26:38.770 --> 26:42.930]  Christmas, but cause this town is known for getting the light green Christmas bud right
[26:42.930 --> 26:48.210]  around Christmas. Yep. That's amazing. Now that I know more about growing and everything that's,
[26:48.210 --> 26:53.010]  I guarantee that's probably auto flower. I used to get late season. Yeah. Yep. But the, there's a
[26:53.010 --> 26:58.450]  lot of talk about the Mexican cartels using auto flower strains so that they can keep stuff going
[26:58.450 --> 27:02.770]  year round. And we talk about the one crop that was busted in the forest near us. That was all
[27:02.770 --> 27:09.410]  auto flowers. Yeah. Yeah. That's so yeah. That's how they do that. They're, uh, they're,
[27:09.410 --> 27:15.010]  those girls are cookie cutter. There's every single one of them is the same. Um, I mean,
[27:15.010 --> 27:21.490]  there are different locations, but the way they grow, I mean, the, the cops, I can tell by looking
[27:21.490 --> 27:25.810]  at the pictures most of the time, uh, even the cops know, you know, the DEA, there's just a
[27:25.810 --> 27:31.890]  certain like fucking billion is crew were here again. So if you're ever going to bust out a big
[27:31.890 --> 27:37.890]  old grow that somewhere, uh, find out what that is and grow just like that. Uh, get some Mexican
[27:37.890 --> 27:43.170]  food, like buy your food from the Mexican store with no English on the labels. Uh, just store a
[27:43.170 --> 27:46.290]  bunch of it there. Cause I think that's what gives them the first hint. Like, Oh, it's a bunch of
[27:46.290 --> 27:50.610]  sure. What did they call them? Mexican nationals is what they labeled them as in the paper.
[27:50.610 --> 27:54.850]  So, and they're like, how do you know that we found tortillas? Like, Oh, good job police.
[27:56.850 --> 28:00.130]  I used to get mad when I found seeds in my weed, like pay good money for kind,
[28:00.130 --> 28:03.810]  but there'd be seeds in it. Like motherfuckers, come on. I just paid. It's like a half a gram
[28:03.810 --> 28:06.930]  of seeds in here. And now I'm like, what happened to those seeds that threw out the window on fish
[28:06.930 --> 28:13.650]  tour? Like, I wish I had those. I, um, when I was out in California one time, the first time I,
[28:13.650 --> 28:19.410]  um, was exposed to the whole medical marijuana scene and everything kind of changed my life.
[28:19.410 --> 28:27.170]  Actually. Um, I spoke some OG Kush out there from my then girlfriend's, uh, uh, cousin
[28:27.730 --> 28:33.730]  that was full of seeds and I brought, brought him back even, and just over move, moving from,
[28:33.730 --> 28:40.210]  you know, over the years I, uh, lost them. So that's, yeah. You'll find them when the time
[28:40.210 --> 28:45.090]  is right. Hopefully they're long gone. I just want you guys to talk about my first experience
[28:45.090 --> 28:48.930]  with medical marijuana, because I just, I've got a cool fucking story. I'm not going to tell it on
[28:48.930 --> 28:55.410]  this, but it's another podcast. I just thought about that. Um, I saw a 4k room. It was all
[28:55.410 --> 29:01.650]  lined out all fucking now that I'm a more experienced grower, like total Cali style
[29:01.650 --> 29:05.970]  fucking flood and drain table, rock wool slabs and everything. That's the way to do it. But
[29:05.970 --> 29:11.570]  the fast track, it just blew my mind. It was like the, Oh man, all these things I thought about
[29:11.570 --> 29:17.890]  that room then, like just how huge it was and how much money they must make and all that and
[29:17.890 --> 29:23.890]  how much work it was. And now I kind of chuckle, but yeah, that's four lights. Huh? Okay. Totally
[29:24.290 --> 29:31.330]  the first big fucking room I ever saw. Yeah, no, I, I, I try to now when we walk, I remember the
[29:31.330 --> 29:35.090]  first time that I walked into like a giant commercial grow, I had to like kind of bite my
[29:35.090 --> 29:39.090]  lip and try to keep my face straight instead of shit in my pants and getting a boner. And now
[29:39.090 --> 29:42.930]  when I walk into big grows, people still try to like the owner of a girl will walk in and they
[29:42.930 --> 29:47.170]  peek at you and they try to read your face. And I just try to keep that straight face the whole
[29:47.170 --> 29:53.170]  time. Like, Oh, this is a cute bro. When sometimes I'm like, Oh my God, there's 500 lights in this
[29:53.170 --> 29:58.450]  one room. Like, yeah, I, that, yeah, you guys don't take it for granted. Go check out some
[29:58.450 --> 30:02.690]  cool girls and appreciate it. We're jaded. Now we've been to too many places. We put too many
[30:02.690 --> 30:07.010]  hours in and too many facilities. I've been in more facilities than I care to admit. I've been
[30:07.010 --> 30:11.730]  in half the facilities in this great state. All right, let's talk a little bit more about
[30:11.730 --> 30:15.650]  compost. We kind of got sidetracked. I want to ask a couple other questions also, but I want to keep
[30:15.650 --> 30:19.890]  on. I just wanted to ask you, what was one of your, what's your favorite shit to smoke? Because
[30:19.890 --> 30:22.690]  we were talking about seeds and I had a strain in mind that I wanted to ask you about. And I was
[30:22.690 --> 30:26.610]  like, I wonder if he'll mention that because it was a Pueblo favorite. What's one of your favorites
[30:26.610 --> 30:31.170]  to smoke? I think I know what you're talking about. You do. I'm sure you do. I haven't seen
[30:31.170 --> 30:39.170]  that shit. I've got seeds of it. Yeah, yeah. Fuck. What was that? P bud? The P 91 P 91. That's right.
[30:39.170 --> 30:49.490]  P buds. The Kim dog, dude. Yeah. Yeah, no, I remember getting that. But my favorite stuff
[30:49.490 --> 30:56.930]  to smoke nowadays is just like, Oh, geez. Yetis. Okay. Okay. The P 91 was amazing. The OGs and the
[30:56.930 --> 31:05.570]  Yetis a great stuff to smoke. I bet the P 91 was related to like the deep chunk sweet tooth was
[31:05.570 --> 31:14.210]  pit bull and or is bull rider and Northern Lights five I think. Oh, I don't remember exactly. I
[31:14.210 --> 31:18.770]  could Google it if you want. I would make the strain I'm kind of thinking about bull riders
[31:18.770 --> 31:24.450]  and Afghani. Yep. And Northern Lights number five, I believe is the Indica version. And I could be
[31:24.450 --> 31:28.610]  completely wrong by the Northern Lights. I know it's bull rider or pit bull, which is they're
[31:28.610 --> 31:33.970]  similar. And it's it's from Stoney girl seeds is who actually put that one out and seed for him
[31:33.970 --> 31:37.810]  in the beginning. And then now there's another company I think it was Gold Coast genetics,
[31:37.810 --> 31:41.170]  maybe who I got the seeds from. I've got a 10 pack. They charged me way too much.
[31:41.810 --> 31:46.770]  But for the nostalgia is like I need that shit. I haven't I've been real I hold the seeds like
[31:46.770 --> 31:51.330]  they're precious and I want to pop them at the right time for sure. All right. So I'm expecting
[31:51.330 --> 31:55.490]  company. Our good friend, Lindsey, the traveling stoner and Bobo are coming over. Bobo Blaster
[31:55.490 --> 31:59.410]  Co's birthday was a few days ago and he got a sweet new rig from our friends. Rebel Glass.
[31:59.410 --> 32:02.450]  It's fucking dope. We're going to take some dabs out of that. We've got some time left. I just
[32:02.450 --> 32:06.370]  wanted to give you a warning. Let's talk about composting so that when they because I just told
[32:06.370 --> 32:09.650]  them to show up. They're just going to walk in eventually. And we may either hand them a
[32:09.650 --> 32:13.730]  microphone or we'll wrap up. We'll see how it goes. It's going to be very informal. Let's talk
[32:13.730 --> 32:21.970]  about composting until then. Sweet. So we go ahead. Fuck. I'm trying to remember where we are.
[32:22.770 --> 32:27.330]  We've got the worms. We've got the Bokashi. We're talking about getting it in a 40 gallon
[32:27.330 --> 32:32.210]  container. You've got your worms living in newspaper. You got ground, chopped up phone
[32:32.210 --> 32:38.930]  books, wood chunks, bark type stuff. I imagine come free. Come on. The Bokashi pulled the Bokashi
[32:38.930 --> 32:48.050]  bucket pulp. And that's pretty. Oh, I threw in some oyster shell. OK, some malted barley seed.
[32:48.050 --> 32:56.530]  OK, oyster shell just to give them some cow mag. And I was told by a worm keeping friend that
[32:56.530 --> 33:01.810]  oyster shell helps bulk the worms themselves up. Make them fatter. Yeah. Make them eat more. Make
[33:01.810 --> 33:09.170]  them work a little harder. Yeah. OK. So and part of my plan with this big worm container is to
[33:09.170 --> 33:17.410]  release in my garden in the spring, early summer so that I'm just I'm building up the soil in my
[33:17.410 --> 33:22.850]  garden year after year after year. If I can dump, I mean, fuck, 10,000 worms or something like that.
[33:22.850 --> 33:27.010]  I might end up with shit. I don't even know. That'd be amazing. They just turn that soil all
[33:27.010 --> 33:33.730]  day long. Yeah. Yeah. And you and your dad go fishing. Yeah, but I don't use worms. OK. Fly
[33:33.730 --> 33:38.130]  fishermen. OK. Purist. You don't want to just go sit there all day. You want to do something. Yeah.
[33:38.130 --> 33:44.530]  No, that's not really my type of fishing. I understand. So now we've got we've gotten
[33:44.530 --> 33:49.570]  dope ass compost now. Yeah. What do we do with that? Do we want to cut some of that 50 percent,
[33:49.570 --> 33:54.370]  25 percent with regular soil? Let's let's act like we're going to put it into a potted plant to grow
[33:54.370 --> 33:59.410]  either indoors or outdoors. How much of that compost do you want to use? If you're building
[33:59.410 --> 34:06.690]  a soil from scratch, I would recommend like 30, 40 percent. OK. Compost. You don't have to use
[34:06.690 --> 34:11.570]  that much. It's just I mean, that's ideal. It's available. Yeah. Yeah. If you've got that,
[34:11.570 --> 34:15.170]  you know, you want to top dress that or do you want to blend it in when you start?
[34:15.170 --> 34:21.730]  If you're building the soil, I would totally recommend blending it. If you are top dressing,
[34:21.730 --> 34:28.610]  I would do. I want to say like a quarter cup per gallon container. Oh, OK. So if you got a
[34:28.610 --> 34:34.450]  seven gallon, I would recommend three and a half cups. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds about right. You
[34:34.450 --> 34:39.170]  did the odd number to yourself. I saw. Yeah, I'm trying to think of what I do. Yeah. What I tell
[34:39.170 --> 34:48.850]  the guys at work. So. And if you're recharging the soil or like reusing the soil like Jeff does,
[34:49.010 --> 34:55.090]  I would probably say like 20 percent, 25 percent, maybe. All right. Maybe even as low as 15. It kind
[34:55.090 --> 35:01.730]  of depends on how much aeration your soil has and if you want to add any in or or not. So. OK.
[35:01.730 --> 35:06.370]  Aeration is important. You guys, we learned our lesson. I put some plants into cocoa and I did
[35:06.370 --> 35:10.530]  not put anything in there to aerate it. And those plants pretty much gave me the middle finger their
[35:10.530 --> 35:15.570]  whole lives. Yeah. They did not like that at all. Yeah. It's super compressed. You got to fill that
[35:15.890 --> 35:22.930]  up with some perlite, put something in there to kind of air it up for sure. All right. You can
[35:22.930 --> 35:27.170]  also make teas with your compost. Yes, that was what I was going to ask. That's awesome. Yeah.
[35:27.810 --> 35:33.170]  So with compost, make sure you you have a consistent temperature. I've been told
[35:34.530 --> 35:41.410]  if you let it get too warm, you can potentially have some funky stuff. OK. In your tea or in the
[35:41.410 --> 35:50.770]  compost itself? In your tea. OK. All right. A lot of people talk crap about compost or you'll find
[35:50.770 --> 35:58.210]  people that talk shit about it. One of the things they claim is it has E. coli in it, which it
[35:58.210 --> 36:04.450]  possibly could have E. coli in it. OK. But it also has a million other fucking things that are way
[36:04.450 --> 36:10.370]  nastier than E. coli that don't harm us. Wouldn't a large percentage of your fruits and vegetables
[36:10.370 --> 36:15.890]  have E. coli anyway when you purchase them? Yeah. OK. Trace amounts at least. They're shipped.
[36:18.050 --> 36:24.610]  So would that mean maybe not to use a compost tea as a foliar feed? That's the way to get around
[36:24.610 --> 36:29.410]  that, right? Just feed it to the roots and not the foliar. Yeah. I personally would never use an
[36:29.410 --> 36:35.650]  actual compost tea for foliar either. I would strictly save that for worm castings. OK. Yeah,
[36:35.650 --> 36:39.250]  for sure. Without a doubt. All right. So that's the way to get around that. Yeah. No worry there.
[36:39.250 --> 36:44.130]  Feed it to the soil. Magical happen. The E. coli goes away. Yeah. And also with compost,
[36:44.130 --> 36:49.650]  you can make a concentrate where just take your compost, put it in a cheesecloth,
[36:50.930 --> 36:54.450]  massage it in water or underneath water for about 10 minutes.
[36:54.450 --> 36:57.490]  Like put it in a bucket of water and just kind of rub it out a little? Yeah. OK.
[36:59.090 --> 37:02.130]  Yeah. Well, that's kind of what you do. I thought I was trying to let that joke fly.
[37:02.130 --> 37:06.370]  That's actually what you're doing. You're rubbing it out. You need it like a loaf of bread. OK.
[37:06.930 --> 37:13.330]  All right. Perverts. And then that makes a compost or worm casting. You can do either one,
[37:13.330 --> 37:20.370]  a concentrate. And it has a longer shelf life than an aerated tea. OK. Wow. Yeah. That's useful.
[37:20.370 --> 37:24.690]  Something I just learned. Yeah. So you just you're taking old food scraps and recycled
[37:24.690 --> 37:28.930]  dirt and putting it in cheesecloth and squeezing it and making your own nutrients. Yeah. Why not
[37:28.930 --> 37:33.410]  do this? Let's stop making waste. Let's stop wasting shit. Let's stop spending money on
[37:33.410 --> 37:37.170]  companies that do not really support the cannabis movement or us or our wallets.
[37:37.170 --> 37:42.210]  Yeah. Let's stop making trucks drive across the country with bottles of water. Oh, man.
[37:42.210 --> 37:45.970]  Right. Because that's you're paying for water when you buy whatever brand you use. I love
[37:45.970 --> 37:50.130]  botanic care. But still, every time I buy a bottle of pure blend pro or liquid karma,
[37:50.130 --> 37:55.650]  I had to pay a truck to drive that shit from Arizona to Colorado. Then I had to pay some
[37:55.650 --> 38:00.130]  dude at a hydro shot with a mullet to fucking unloaded off the truck and then sell it to me.
[38:00.130 --> 38:03.570]  And then I had to buy it home and measure it out. I probably could have just taken some kelp
[38:03.570 --> 38:07.650]  and seabird guano, whatever the fuck else is in that product. And I could have made my own,
[38:07.650 --> 38:13.410]  probably. And I had to even vege was blue. Yeah. I mean, if you want to grow salts,
[38:13.410 --> 38:19.810]  you know, you could still be kind of environmentally friendly. Yes. Yes. But
[38:19.810 --> 38:24.210]  I'm what I'm getting at is I can make that and I don't have to add to that truck driving that
[38:24.210 --> 38:30.450]  emissions, the water being shipped, the gas, the exhaust. Like we could do it ourselves. And
[38:30.450 --> 38:38.130]  not only that, you're diverting food from going into the landfill. Exactly. So you're just you're
[38:38.130 --> 38:43.170]  in basically money from going right into the same landfill. Yeah. Yeah. Put it back into your crop
[38:43.170 --> 38:48.290]  back in your wallet. You're producing something. You're not depending on someone for that little
[38:48.290 --> 38:54.450]  tiny bit of your life. You know, it only may be that part, but I love, you know, trying to be
[38:54.450 --> 38:59.330]  a producer, not a consumer. So it may sound a little weird, but there's a good feeling knowing
[38:59.330 --> 39:05.570]  that my vivacious, healthy, green, vigorous cannabis plants are on nearly the same diet
[39:05.570 --> 39:09.730]  as myself. Oh, for sure. It makes me think maybe other than all this freaking Dr. Pepper I'm
[39:09.730 --> 39:15.090]  addicted to, maybe I'm green and vivacious and vigorous as well. Keeps me going. Keeps me strong.
[39:15.410 --> 39:17.970]  All right, dude, we've been going for like 40 minutes. You got anything else you want to talk
[39:17.970 --> 39:21.650]  about composting before we get a doorbell ringing and we get some new stoners showing up? No, no,
[39:21.650 --> 39:27.330]  we can wrap it up. We can touch back later if anyone's got any questions. I could easily talk
[39:27.330 --> 39:31.250]  more. Yeah. You're getting good at podcasting by the way, bro. You're really comfortable now.
[39:31.250 --> 39:37.250]  Thank you. Other than being a little cold in here. Yeah, I'm fine on that. I'm just,
[39:37.250 --> 39:43.330]  I'm trying to build my schedule. I've got a busy life that was all of a sudden, well, I don't know.
[39:43.490 --> 39:50.530]  I've always had a busy life, but a few months ago it just all of a sudden really stepped up.
[39:50.530 --> 39:57.330]  That's good. Yeah, so it's good, but it's bad for my podcast and I have all these ideals and
[39:58.690 --> 40:02.690]  just plans and everything. I'm just trying to adjust into my schedule.
[40:02.690 --> 40:04.850]  I understand that. Expect a kick-ass
[40:05.570 --> 40:10.210]  podcast coming from me besides the Colorado Dope podcast. Oh, you got a new idea coming.
[40:10.690 --> 40:16.370]  Excellent. I'll go ahead, but it's going to be the High Grade Homestead.
[40:16.370 --> 40:24.530]  I like that. It'll be more than just cannabis growing. We're going to talk about gardening and
[40:27.170 --> 40:30.530]  chickens and all kinds of shit. Stuff you'd find on a homestead.
[40:30.530 --> 40:34.450]  I love it. I love it. If you ever need a cannabis expert on that show,
[40:34.450 --> 40:36.530]  I'll come be on your show. I got a show planned out for you.
[40:36.690 --> 40:41.330]  Shout out to the rest of the Colorado Dope podcast, boys.
[40:41.330 --> 40:45.010]  For sure. Thanks for letting me borrow Jesse for a little bit. Also, shout out to Berne.
[40:45.010 --> 40:48.210]  Thanks for letting your husband come hang out for a couple hours. I got him stupid high.
[40:48.210 --> 40:53.170]  I'm going to send him up even higher. I'm still on the, I haven't really been dabbing diet.
[40:53.170 --> 40:55.810]  Oh man. Well, there's another dab waiting with your name on it.
[40:55.810 --> 40:58.850]  I'm just waiting to finish this show. I'm trying to be as coherent as possible.
[40:59.970 --> 41:03.410]  Berne also takes great care of me when I go to the Hydro shop. She's always excited to see me.
[41:03.410 --> 41:07.890]  She gives me a big hug. She's super friendly and she is great customer service. So big shout out to
[41:07.890 --> 41:10.850]  Berne. Thanks for letting me borrow your husband for an hour or two to get him stupid ripped and
[41:10.850 --> 41:17.810]  do a podcast. I look forward to hearing the, Oh, homegrown homes to high grade homestead.
[41:17.810 --> 41:21.410]  That's a lot of letters to put in my brain, but I look forward to hearing that. I hope my listeners
[41:21.410 --> 41:26.610]  follow you on that podcast. I'm sure they're going to follow you on Instagram at Jesse grows.
[41:27.170 --> 41:31.170]  And they're also going to check out the Colorado podcast, Instagram page while they're at it.
[41:31.170 --> 41:35.970]  They're going to go follow me on Instagram. It's Irie underscore genetics, dude. I want to thank
[41:35.970 --> 41:39.810]  you for joining me on the podcast. We've been here for like two hours. So I appreciate that.
[41:40.850 --> 41:45.730]  I'm going to do a couple of wrap ups. Make sure you find me on all the social media guys. I'm on
[41:45.730 --> 41:50.210]  Facebook. It's the girl from your heart podcast. I'm on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. Also, you
[41:50.210 --> 41:53.970]  know, I would love it. If you go to iTunes, it leaves me a rating and a review. I'm sure you
[41:53.970 --> 41:58.770]  know how to find the ratings and reviews by now. Everybody so far has given me a five-star review.
[41:58.770 --> 42:01.330]  You know, it'd be cool if you follow suit, but if you feel like you want to be different,
[42:01.330 --> 42:05.650]  do what you need to do. Also, let me remind you about a new service I've signed up for. It is
[42:05.650 --> 42:11.490]  called Patreon. Patreon is a service that will allow my listeners to make a financial contribution
[42:11.490 --> 42:16.210]  to the show. If they feel so inclined, if you feel like the information or knowledge or friendship,
[42:16.210 --> 42:21.490]  I have provided you, or just, you want to throw some money around, go to patrion.com slash grow
[42:21.490 --> 42:27.170]  from your heart. And what that will allow you to do is sign up to contribute a monthly contribution.
[42:27.170 --> 42:31.090]  You can contribute as little as $1. I honestly don't think there's a limit to the amount of
[42:31.090 --> 42:34.450]  zeros you can add to that. I don't think there is. Yeah. So however many zeros you want to add
[42:34.450 --> 42:38.690]  to that dollar sign, go ahead and put a one, put a five, put a nine in front of there. However you
[42:38.690 --> 42:43.570]  want to do it. No, I would appreciate though. If you sign up for Patreon, you can contribute $1 to
[42:43.570 --> 42:47.490]  the show. It will charge you every, the first of every month. And then that will send that right
[42:47.490 --> 42:50.930]  over to my PayPal account. And honestly, I'm not trying to make a bunch of money off my friends
[42:50.930 --> 42:55.330]  and my listeners. What that will do, that will help me pay for the cost of my website. You guys,
[42:55.330 --> 43:02.130]  I read genetics, colorado.com cost me about $315 per year to keep up there. And that is how I
[43:02.130 --> 43:05.170]  deliver you this podcast. I'm not trying to get rich. I'm just trying to offset that. I'm not
[43:05.170 --> 43:09.570]  trying to pay for that out of my pocket. Ah, not begging either. So if you would like to go to
[43:09.570 --> 43:14.610]  Patreon, go check it out. Patreon.com slash grow from your heart. I would really appreciate it.
[43:14.610 --> 43:19.250]  Also. Yeah. Jesse says do it. And he's a big guy. So do it. I did it even. Yeah. Jesse did do it.
[43:19.250 --> 43:23.810]  Jesse was my second contributor to Patreon. That's where I was headed next. Big shout out to all
[43:23.810 --> 43:27.570]  three of the people who have contributed to my Patreon so far. I appreciate all three of you.
[43:27.570 --> 43:32.850]  I'm not sure if everybody wants to be listed by name. Uh, so you know who you are. Big shout out,
[43:32.850 --> 43:37.410]  much love, much respect. I appreciate the support. Uh, even if you can't contribute to
[43:37.410 --> 43:41.170]  Patreon, you guys, I love you. And I appreciate you just for listening to the podcast. You don't
[43:41.170 --> 43:44.610]  have to give me money. You don't have to give me anything to be my friend. I love you guys.
[43:44.610 --> 43:48.690]  I appreciate you being there and supporting the podcast. I extra, especially support.
[43:49.410 --> 43:52.690]  Thank you for supporting cannabis. You guys had a lot of caffeine and dabs. My brain's going too
[43:52.690 --> 43:56.370]  fast, but I appreciate you for supporting cannabis. And like I said earlier, I completely
[43:56.370 --> 44:02.370]  trust you or thank you for trusting me to be your cannabis guru. It means a lot to me. It sounds like
[44:02.370 --> 44:06.370]  I need to wrap up the show because my tongue is tying itself in a damn knot. So, uh, I think all
[44:06.370 --> 44:11.330]  I have to say now is a big shout out to my friend, the barefoot grower. And until next time, take a fat
[44:11.330 --> 44:13.170]  dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[45:23.290 --> 45:49.080]  He used to teach at my high school. He caused quite an uproar with diamonds and fives and a ring on each finger.
[45:49.080 --> 46:00.920]  And what a whole lot more. None of us raised our hand to ask him why. Because it was a hell of a chore.
[46:00.920 --> 46:07.480]  Look at him, it feels like he was a porno star.
[46:08.040 --> 48:49.210]  They drove a bat, bat, bat.
[48:49.210 --> 49:01.210]  They were the topic that made Geraldo great. Went to the preacher to thank their souls and he said it's not too late.
[49:01.210 --> 49:09.210]  When we asked them about their car and their finest date, they said we like who we are.
[49:09.770 --> 49:11.770]  And that was really great.
[49:11.770 --> 49:15.770]  They were a porno star.
