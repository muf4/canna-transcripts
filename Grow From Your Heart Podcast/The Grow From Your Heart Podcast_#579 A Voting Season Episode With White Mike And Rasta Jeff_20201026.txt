[01:05.250 --> 01:07.330]  Thanks, man. What's up everybody?
[01:07.330 --> 01:10.690]  Dude, you sound great on the microphone today. Compliments. We've been hanging out before
[01:10.690 --> 01:15.210]  the show and you've sounded wonderful so far. Stay right where you are. Don't change a thing.
[01:15.210 --> 01:16.210]  Trying to stay on the mic, everybody.
[01:16.210 --> 01:21.290]  Yeah, you're doing a really good job on it, bro. Mike, what are you smoking on today,
[01:21.290 --> 01:22.290]  bro?
[01:22.290 --> 01:24.330]  All kinds of deliciousness.
[01:24.610 --> 01:26.650]  That's a good answer.
[01:26.650 --> 01:30.690]  One of our local dispensaries had some fire golden goat flour.
[01:30.690 --> 01:31.690]  I smelled that.
[01:31.690 --> 01:36.290]  I've been enjoying a lot of that. Yep. We were shopping together that day, had them
[01:36.290 --> 01:41.530]  open the jar. Thanks to COVID, you can't get your face in the jar anymore, which is always
[01:41.530 --> 01:47.890]  a little iffy to me, but it was nice to get a good whiff of what you were buying, get
[01:47.890 --> 01:53.730]  a good look at what you were buying. But now they stick it in the butcher case in front
[01:53.730 --> 01:57.770]  of me and open it so you can see it. And as soon as they cracked the jar, we could
[01:57.770 --> 01:59.970]  smell the goat. And yeah, it's pretty tasty.
[01:59.970 --> 02:04.090]  I threw my mask. I was wearing a mask and I could smell. I said, ooh, that's good golden
[02:04.090 --> 02:06.690]  goat as soon as it opened up. Yeah.
[02:06.690 --> 02:12.130]  I've been enjoying it and it's got me in a nice podcasting mood. What have you been smoking
[02:12.130 --> 02:13.210]  on lately, buddy?
[02:13.210 --> 02:16.890]  I'm glad you asked. Well, let me fix my mic. I just turned myself down too much. Thank
[02:16.890 --> 02:21.050]  you for asking, Mike. I'm smoking Halo Live Batter. This is a blend of Headbanger and
[02:21.050 --> 02:25.210]  Infinity OG. I do the thing where I talk about what it says on the package. It says
[02:25.210 --> 02:30.710]  it tastes like deconstructed sour diesel. I don't know what the fuck deconstructed sour
[02:30.710 --> 02:35.290]  diesel tastes like, but it is kind of coffee and gassy at the same time. It's got some
[02:35.290 --> 02:40.730]  earthy tones to it. I really do enjoy it. On the back of the package, it says 66.74%
[02:40.730 --> 02:48.050]  THC, non-detectable amounts of CBD. Halo Live Batter. I dig it, dude. Really nice buzz.
[02:48.050 --> 02:53.810]  Perfect chilled out mode. Yeah, that taste is great. It's got a funky, gassy, disgustingly
[02:53.810 --> 02:57.810]  delicious aroma. And those are my favorites. Those gross and delicious aromas.
[02:57.810 --> 03:04.370]  If you see me hitting a cart this episode, that's what's in the cart is some Halo oil.
[03:04.370 --> 03:08.210]  I may need to grab myself a couple of pens or a couple of fat joints for these episodes
[03:08.210 --> 03:11.130]  when we hang out because I need something to do with my hands. I don't know what to
[03:11.130 --> 03:12.930]  do with my hands.
[03:12.930 --> 03:17.250]  I noticed that if I keep this on me, I don't move around at the desk as much.
[03:17.410 --> 03:20.050]  Yeah. I may need my sound management plan.
[03:20.930 --> 03:24.610]  It's working, bro. I may need a pop prop and or pacifier for myself.
[03:24.610 --> 03:27.490]  I don't know if it's a sound plan, but it's working.
[03:27.490 --> 03:30.290]  Dude, keep doing what you're doing. You sound great and you look great and you're fucking
[03:30.290 --> 03:33.570]  stoned. So everything is perfect. Speaking of people who look great.
[03:33.570 --> 03:35.970]  I can't see anything, but people can see me now.
[03:35.970 --> 03:39.010]  Yeah. Yeah. We put some lights in Mike's face. You guys, people have been saying that he
[03:39.010 --> 03:43.090]  looks like a talking head. We put a light in front of him. That is what Mike looks like.
[03:43.090 --> 03:47.170]  That's his smiling face there. So thanks for joining me today, bro. And thanks for checking
[03:47.170 --> 03:50.130]  out my new lighting situation in the room here. I'm doing my best.
[03:50.130 --> 03:51.890]  This new office looks dope.
[03:51.890 --> 03:56.130]  Thank you, bro. Thank you. Doing what I can with what I've got. Trying to move away from
[03:56.130 --> 03:59.970]  that old crowded dusty space. There are more improvements coming. I keep teasing that you
[03:59.970 --> 04:01.410]  guys are going to be as excited as I am.
[04:01.410 --> 04:02.770]  More improvements coming.
[04:02.770 --> 04:06.210]  Mike knows what's coming. Mike, if you tell anyone, you know how it goes. I gotta kill
[04:06.210 --> 04:06.370]  you.
[04:07.010 --> 04:08.850]  It's more improvements, y'all.
[04:08.850 --> 04:09.090]  Yes.
[04:10.850 --> 04:14.450]  I tried to segue into it smoothly a moment ago, but we didn't make it there. So this
[04:14.450 --> 04:18.770]  is the part of the show where we are going to do shout outs to the members of the 710
[04:18.770 --> 04:22.930]  club. Of course, the 710 club are the folks who support the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[04:22.930 --> 04:28.610]  on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher. So I'm going to do some shout outs. Let's
[04:28.610 --> 04:32.210]  start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out to our good
[04:32.210 --> 04:36.450]  friend, Godfather Kush. Let's send a thank you shout out to Matt H. I want to send a
[04:36.450 --> 04:40.130]  thank you shout out to Just a Smokin'. I want to send a shout out to one of my favorite
[04:40.130 --> 04:44.050]  names I see on Patreon, which is Willie's armpit. That's fucking cool. Shout out Willie
[04:44.050 --> 04:48.050]  and your armpit. Let's send a shout out to Keith K. I want to send a special thank you
[04:48.050 --> 04:53.010]  shout out to one of our longest standing Patreon contributors. Big special shout out
[04:53.010 --> 04:57.810]  to John Bendit. Special shout out to Brett G. Special super thank you shout out to the
[04:57.810 --> 05:01.810]  captain and commander of the Irie Army. Let's send a special thank you shout out to the
[05:01.810 --> 05:07.250]  two lemur priests. And last, but certainly not least, let's send a big thank you shout
[05:07.250 --> 05:12.770]  out to our friend, The Canicrat, who is actually on Eagle Garden's podcast as we speak. Had
[05:12.850 --> 05:17.410]  to check out to come do the podcast, but shout out to The Canicrat. Big thanks and big shout
[05:17.410 --> 05:21.330]  out to everybody who supports the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Patreon. If you'd like
[05:21.330 --> 05:26.450]  to support the podcast on Patreon, it's really easy. Go to patreon.com forward slash grow
[05:26.450 --> 05:30.050]  from your heart. I will include a link in the show notes to make it easy. The reason
[05:30.050 --> 05:34.210]  I'm rushing through that part is because I need to give Mike an opportunity to do some
[05:34.210 --> 05:38.130]  shout outs to a few of his patrons and give some love. So Michael, turn it over to you.
[05:38.130 --> 05:45.650]  These are Mike's Patreon shout outs. I want to give a shout out to Papa Z, Giant Mike,
[05:46.850 --> 05:52.130]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast is a new sponsor. Appreciate that, buddy. Richard,
[05:52.130 --> 06:00.370]  thank you very much. EZO5, appreciate it. Farmer Z and Learnin' and Burnin'. All my Patreon
[06:00.370 --> 06:05.810]  supporters, I appreciate you very, very much. If you'd like to support me on Patreon, it's
[06:05.810 --> 06:12.130]  patreon.com forward slash white Mike. Very well done, buddy. Very well done. Doesn't it feel nice
[06:12.130 --> 06:17.170]  getting some support from the community? We put in a few hours here. They turn around and give us
[06:17.170 --> 06:24.850]  hours back. It makes me feel awesome. It's so much love. Thank you so much, all of our supporters.
[06:26.050 --> 06:30.610]  I agree. Yeah, getting choked up a little bit. Part of that's the dab I took right before the
[06:31.570 --> 06:39.970]  show. Most of that's the dab I just took. Part of that's the support. It's growing every week.
[06:41.090 --> 06:45.890]  Yeah, guys, thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. I truly appreciate it. Mike appreciates
[06:45.890 --> 06:50.850]  it. We were joking before the show. I made a joke on another episode that Mike spends the Patreon
[06:50.850 --> 06:55.810]  funding on his kids and he goes, buddy, you couldn't be more right. So true. Super funny.
[06:55.810 --> 06:59.170]  Yeah, the kids are getting spoiled because of you guys. So the kids, I'm not going to say their
[06:59.170 --> 07:03.010]  names. We'll keep their names private on the show. But those two little guys are sending you guys
[07:03.970 --> 07:11.330]  sticky fist bumps. Right. If you're wondering where I am, it's small children are exhausting.
[07:12.210 --> 07:14.530]  Yeah. Yeah. That's why he's not on the show. And that's also why he's hidden.
[07:14.530 --> 07:18.690]  The world's closed. That's why we've got him hidden away in a small dark space right now.
[07:18.690 --> 07:22.130]  He's just sequestered from the family for a moment so he can get some time.
[07:22.850 --> 07:28.050]  And if you're not on video, this is sort of a weird moment of the show. But the background
[07:28.050 --> 07:31.810]  behind me is flat black. So I really just do look like a floating head right now.
[07:31.810 --> 07:35.970]  Completely do. You've been called a floating head in the videos. I am learning more about
[07:35.970 --> 07:42.450]  video production. We'll get Mike up to speed. I have been using some of my Patreon contributions
[07:42.450 --> 07:46.130]  for things to improve the show. And once I get my show where I want it, we're going to get some of
[07:46.130 --> 07:50.690]  my Patreon contributions over toward Mike's area to get his recording space looking as good as mine.
[07:51.330 --> 07:55.650]  We owe it to Mike and to the audience here. So yeah, we're going to do that.
[07:55.890 --> 07:59.890]  Mike, this is a good flow. This may turn into a long episode. We did not intend for this long
[07:59.890 --> 08:02.690]  of a show, but I think we took the appropriate dabs today.
[08:02.690 --> 08:06.610]  It could be. It's late. We're dabbed. There was Steve involved.
[08:06.610 --> 08:08.850]  They like it when we ramble.
[08:08.850 --> 08:10.690]  Oh, they most certainly do.
[08:10.690 --> 08:15.010]  This is going to be a good one. Mike, is this the time of the show where we segue into the email
[08:15.010 --> 08:17.330]  portion of the podcast? Do you want to jump right into that part?
[08:18.210 --> 08:24.210]  I think we should. We checked off all the essentials, right? We did any ads,
[08:25.170 --> 08:31.010]  we did the shout outs, we did the intro song. I think it's time to talk about the topic of the
[08:31.010 --> 08:31.490]  show.
[08:31.490 --> 08:34.930]  Yeah, we covered all the important stuff. We said thank you to the people that help us make the
[08:34.930 --> 08:38.930]  show happen. And that is really the important part. We reminded them to buy some seeds.
[08:39.570 --> 08:40.530]  You say appetizers?
[08:41.170 --> 08:43.330]  Appetizers are complete, onto the meal.
[08:43.330 --> 08:46.610]  All right. Oh, I thought you said advertisers and I was jokingly saying appetizers,
[08:46.610 --> 08:48.050]  but you did say appetizers.
[08:48.050 --> 08:49.410]  I said appetizers.
[08:49.410 --> 08:54.050]  Come on, bro. I'm stoned. You're going to make me hungry. Let's focus in here just a little,
[08:54.450 --> 08:59.250]  because it's early to jump off the diving board this early into the show.
[08:59.250 --> 09:04.130]  I've got a great email in front of me. Do they want their name said? It's just letters and
[09:04.130 --> 09:09.010]  numbers anyway, so I'm not going to say their name. It says, Rasta Jeff, I listened to your
[09:09.010 --> 09:13.330]  podcast today and there was a short portion on gross safety. If you follow the show a little
[09:13.330 --> 09:17.650]  while back, I've done a couple of episodes now on keeping yourself and your gross safe.
[09:17.650 --> 09:20.530]  I don't want you poking your eye. I don't want you going to jail. I don't want you burning down
[09:20.530 --> 09:25.970]  the house. I've done what I can to update you on ideas of how to keep your grow and your family and
[09:25.970 --> 09:29.490]  yourself safe while you were growing in the house. We don't need problems in the house.
[09:30.450 --> 09:34.930]  This goes on. It says, you said something that I have often thought about. If someone shows up
[09:34.930 --> 09:41.090]  and there is some dank in the air, how would I explain that shit away? This person lives
[09:41.090 --> 09:46.290]  apparently in prohibition land and they've got a good excuse. If somebody knocks on the door and
[09:46.290 --> 09:50.770]  they say, hey bro, we smell cannabis in your house. There is a problem. This person has a
[09:50.770 --> 09:55.810]  wonderful, in my opinion, what could be a wonderful excuse. I want some feedback from Mike to see if
[09:55.810 --> 10:03.970]  he thinks this would fly. He said, my answer is to have a quarter or two of hemp buds in the house.
[10:03.970 --> 10:09.090]  If anyone comes over knocking on the door about the odor and so I insider out, I hand over the
[10:09.090 --> 10:13.890]  hemp buds and say, sorry sir, I ordered this on the internet. Here's the packaging and everything.
[10:13.890 --> 10:20.690]  I was under the impression that CBD hemp was now okay. It might cost me 50 bucks, but I know
[10:20.690 --> 10:25.250]  someone is paying attention and it will keep my ass out of jail. That is like a good warning that
[10:25.250 --> 10:28.690]  somebody knows you're smoking in there and you need to adjust and adapt and maybe get rid of
[10:28.690 --> 10:33.970]  some things and maybe stop doing some shit. It says, no one knocking on your door would have
[10:33.970 --> 10:38.370]  any further reason to believe it was anything else unless you look like a stoner high guilty,
[10:38.930 --> 10:45.650]  which would be the thing not to do in prohibition land. Yeah. I am very blessed and lucky to live
[10:45.650 --> 10:49.810]  here in Colorado where I can have these dreadlocks. You guys, these dreads are tied up in a nice big
[10:49.810 --> 10:55.650]  old bundle right now because they do get ridiculous. These things go to my calf region and I am six and
[10:55.650 --> 11:00.450]  a half feet tall. So these things are a little bit ridiculous. I can't look like this in a lot
[11:00.450 --> 11:07.730]  of places. That's absolutely what it is in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Texas. It's all,
[11:07.730 --> 11:12.690]  and hey, I said I've made some jokes about Texas on a previous show that I was on. I'm sorry,
[11:12.690 --> 11:17.170]  Texas. I still love you guys. There are great people down there in Texas. Those were jokes. I'm
[11:17.170 --> 11:23.090]  funny. Laugh with me. But so yeah, we can't look like this in fucking a lot of places, Mike. We're
[11:23.090 --> 11:27.010]  very blessed that we have legal cannabis here. And I think the police know that guys that look
[11:27.010 --> 11:30.850]  like you and I, we're not the ones with the other drugs on us. We are the ones with the cannabis
[11:30.850 --> 11:34.690]  because you can tell the crowds apart, I think. And so now there's no need to fuck with us. Like
[11:34.690 --> 11:38.370]  that guy's a weed head. Weed is legal. We're going to go mess with the other heads because
[11:38.370 --> 11:41.730]  they're the problems. They'll get the ones going through your trash and fucking trying to break
[11:41.730 --> 11:48.210]  into your house. So yeah, don't look like a stoner is rule number one. Mike, how do you feel about
[11:48.210 --> 11:52.930]  this approach? If we were in, let's just pick a state. I'll let you pick a state so nobody bashes
[11:52.930 --> 11:58.370]  me for bashing a state. Well, no, that's my thought on it is that it really, really, really,
[11:58.850 --> 12:06.770]  really depends on where you live. A lot of places have already preemptively stepped on this excuse
[12:06.770 --> 12:12.450]  for why it smells like herb at your place and said that smokeable hemp isn't allowed, even though CBD
[12:13.330 --> 12:21.090]  or legal hemp sort of is allowed. There's at least one state that's still saying,
[12:21.810 --> 12:25.570]  it doesn't matter what the feds say about industrial hemp. We say no still.
[12:26.450 --> 12:32.530]  Um, there are a lot of states who haven't invested in the technology to definitively prove
[12:32.530 --> 12:38.370]  high THC, CBD, no THC. So I'm going to cut you off because you just said something that, uh,
[12:38.370 --> 12:42.530]  now I forgot what I was going to cut you off for. Oh, some states we said, Colorado said,
[12:42.530 --> 12:47.170]  Hey, fed, fuck you. We're going legal. Other states have said, Hey, fuck you with your CBD.
[12:47.170 --> 12:51.090]  We still don't want it. I didn't realize that that was a thing. There's opposition. Just,
[12:51.090 --> 12:55.090]  they can oppose just like we approved the fed. That's pretty cool. I didn't even realize that
[12:55.090 --> 13:04.130]  that was a thing. Sometimes I'm ignorant and ignorance is bliss. Um, but, uh, if this ploy
[13:04.130 --> 13:10.690]  has any effect or a positive effect really depends on where you're standing. Okay. Um,
[13:10.690 --> 13:18.730]  a lot of places it smells like herb here is still probable cause for a search on its own. Um,
[13:18.810 --> 13:26.170]  so even if you say it smells, it smells like this because of this legal reason at the door,
[13:26.170 --> 13:29.850]  they're going to say, it doesn't matter. We still get to search and we're gonna,
[13:29.850 --> 13:33.370]  right. It still smells like cannabis and we need to make sure it's not cannabis.
[13:33.930 --> 13:41.770]  In places like Colorado smell alone is no longer probable cause. And so, um, like unless you're
[13:42.090 --> 13:48.570]  driving and it smells like burnt joint, but, um, it's your home at a gross situation at home.
[13:48.570 --> 13:52.490]  I had a, it's been an interesting for you. I'm going to totally interrupt you and I apologize,
[13:52.490 --> 13:57.770]  but this is a good, it's worth it. It's worth it. Um, I have a friend who was pulled over in
[13:57.770 --> 14:05.370]  the great state here of Colorado and he was not even allegedly, he was straight up smoking a blunt,
[14:05.930 --> 14:11.530]  he was not even allegedly, he was straight up smoking a blunt, enjoying his ass smoking a blunt
[14:11.530 --> 14:15.850]  and he got pulled over and he said, smoking a fucking blunt. I'm not even going to try.
[14:15.850 --> 14:19.450]  Like, and he took a couple of fat rips off of it and put it in the ashtray and roll down the window
[14:19.450 --> 14:23.050]  and said, what's up officer. And the cop said, Whoa, it smells like weed in there. What's your
[14:23.050 --> 14:27.450]  hurry? And my buddy goes, I'm trying to go to a thing. It was actually going to, he was meeting
[14:27.450 --> 14:31.770]  me somewhere. It's like, I'm going to a thing and I'm trying to get there. And the cop goes,
[14:31.770 --> 14:34.890]  yeah, we were driving a little bit too fast to be smoking a fucking blunt. You might want to
[14:34.890 --> 14:39.370]  slow yourself down. I gave him a speeding ticket and my buddy was like kind of freaking out and he
[14:39.370 --> 14:42.570]  was all like paranoid. And the cop was like, you can relax, sir. We know you're smoking in there,
[14:42.570 --> 14:48.330]  but you don't seem intoxicated. He told him that consumption did not constitute impairment. And
[14:48.330 --> 14:51.850]  he's like, you seem fine. You're driving too fast. You weren't swerving. You weren't doing anything
[14:51.850 --> 14:56.170]  wrong. Slow it down. If you're going to smoke a blunt while you're driving and sent him on his
[14:56.170 --> 15:03.210]  way, dude, it's up to the cop. How much they want to fuck with you. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and unfortunately
[15:03.210 --> 15:09.770]  right now, um, there's a lot of stories where they choose to fuck with you extra, right? There's
[15:09.770 --> 15:16.330]  also plenty of stories where they choose to fuck with you less. Um, and unfortunately, he's wildly,
[15:17.130 --> 15:21.530]  we're going the same place. We're headed the same place. It depends on what you look like
[15:21.530 --> 15:29.530]  and where you're located. Yup. Yup. Um, I've been fortunate. I get away with stuff. Um,
[15:29.530 --> 15:35.290]  There's a reason why we nicknamed you white why I I'm gonna take the honor why I nicknamed you white mike because you look
[15:35.370 --> 15:38.730]  Like a white guy just a basic general white guy not going to cause any problems
[15:38.890 --> 15:43.210]  Also you guys just for an update I call him white mike because if i'm ever breaking two rules at a time
[15:43.290 --> 15:45.530]  He will remind me only break one law at a time
[15:45.770 --> 15:46.570]  They'd be like hey
[15:46.570 --> 15:51.370]  You're smoking that blunt and going fucking 90 pick one either flick the blunt out the window or go 70
[15:51.690 --> 15:54.490]  Like he'll remind me. He's always like one. He's my free
[15:54.970 --> 15:59.850]  Legal guidance. He's one of my fucking best friends on the planet and he's good at fucking psychology and law
[16:00.090 --> 16:02.090]  That's my white friend over there. That's white mike
[16:02.650 --> 16:05.770]  And I just get to say you can't give yourself a nickname like you don't
[16:06.890 --> 16:10.010]  Right if it's a real nickname, you didn't have a hand in crafting it
[16:11.050 --> 16:13.050]  um, but yeah this uh
[16:13.770 --> 16:15.610]  I I
[16:15.610 --> 16:19.530]  I just talked to somebody who was busted growing. They had a
[16:20.570 --> 16:22.570]  an odor control failure
[16:23.290 --> 16:26.350]  Um a passerby alerted the authorities
[16:27.290 --> 16:30.010]  By the time person got home from work
[16:30.730 --> 16:34.830]  They had a why the fuck you growing all this weed problem on their doorstep
[16:35.690 --> 16:36.650]  and
[16:36.650 --> 16:38.890]  um, they tried to say it was
[16:39.850 --> 16:41.450]  all legal hemp
[16:41.450 --> 16:43.450]  um, luckily
[16:44.650 --> 16:50.970]  Cops don't go to school for lots of stuff and they the school they go to isn't real long or detailed
[16:51.610 --> 16:53.610]  And so a lot of officers
[16:54.570 --> 16:58.570]  Have no fucking idea what they're looking at or what they're talking about which has led to
[16:59.290 --> 17:03.770]  A lot of amusement on my part and probably in the community's part when we see a bust
[17:04.570 --> 17:10.670]  And they're taking the news crew through the grow house and they pointed a carbon filter and go. This is a co2 generator
[17:12.170 --> 17:14.570]  It's like man, the only thing that got right was the lights
[17:15.210 --> 17:18.250]  Right. Um, i've seen that video by the way, that's funny. But uh
[17:18.730 --> 17:23.130]  In practical terms, um, one of the things I told that person is if
[17:23.690 --> 17:25.930]  They took all the plant matter which they tend to do
[17:26.650 --> 17:27.930]  they uh
[17:27.930 --> 17:31.610]  They do exactly what you see them do they stuff all the plants and a bunch of trash bags
[17:32.410 --> 17:34.410]  And then haul that to an evidence locker
[17:35.370 --> 17:39.930]  Anyone who's grown anything knows that when you do that to a living plant
[17:40.650 --> 17:45.290]  What you've done is you've killed a marijuana farm and you've started a mold farm
[17:45.450 --> 17:51.930]  So by the time that product gets to a lab, can they tell if it's thc or cbd product who the fuck knows?
[17:52.890 --> 17:56.990]  Um, I think varies wildly from state to state based on technology
[17:58.090 --> 18:00.090]  I can smell that moldy
[18:00.330 --> 18:03.850]  Fucking dead plant in that bag. It's like lawn clippings plus puke
[18:04.890 --> 18:05.990]  uh-huh
[18:05.990 --> 18:06.890]  Ammonia
[18:06.890 --> 18:09.770]  Then it doesn't take long to mold out either you take a bunch of plants
[18:10.410 --> 18:13.690]  Stick them in a plastic bag you stick that in a plastic bag
[18:14.650 --> 18:19.450]  You stick that in the dark you come back a couple of days later. You've got a big fucking bag of mold
[18:20.570 --> 18:22.170]  um
[18:22.170 --> 18:27.450]  And it's the same thing with the the hemp flower if you say no, it smells like that because it's hemp flower
[18:28.650 --> 18:33.370]  If you're lucky they take the hemp flower or take your word for it
[18:34.250 --> 18:39.210]  If you're not lucky they send it off to get tested. They come back an hour later with a warrant
[18:39.690 --> 18:41.850]  I mean we actually got to be careful with that
[18:41.850 --> 18:43.210]  It does not seem like a good ploy
[18:43.210 --> 18:48.090]  We have to be careful with the claim that it's hemp flower because now with the farm bill and a bunch of hemp acts
[18:48.250 --> 18:52.650]  You are required to have licensing and permits to grow to commercially cultivate hemp
[18:52.890 --> 18:55.770]  It is almost safer to grow cannabis than it is to grow hemp
[18:55.770 --> 18:59.610]  So if they come and you're growing cannabis and they say is this weed or hemp and you say it's hemp
[18:59.930 --> 19:03.690]  They're gonna go get the department of agriculture and you're supposed to have a fucking license for that
[19:03.690 --> 19:08.410]  And you can still get as hefty of a fine. You're not going to face the jail time, but you'll get fined
[19:09.450 --> 19:15.770]  Well, and I mean this takes me back to one of the things I always recommend is really know the law in your area
[19:16.490 --> 19:19.210]  Um, because depending on where you're standing in the u.s
[19:19.850 --> 19:25.610]  You can have all the cannabis plants you want just at your house other places. You can only have a few
[19:26.410 --> 19:29.370]  Other places the plants have to test a certain way
[19:30.490 --> 19:33.450]  Um, and who's to say who gets to test what?
[19:34.090 --> 19:39.050]  There's at least one business outfit going through all kinds of legal headaches right now because
[19:39.690 --> 19:43.290]  They bought a shitload of legal hemp seed on the open market
[19:44.090 --> 19:45.370]  and
[19:45.370 --> 19:50.570]  It wasn't the whole batch that they got but a chunk of their seed ended up being high thc
[19:51.290 --> 19:53.290]  rather than cbd dominant
[19:53.610 --> 19:55.610]  and so they had this big field of
[19:56.010 --> 19:58.010]  hemp and then one corner of it was
[19:58.570 --> 20:00.570]  a high thc cannabis, so
[20:01.130 --> 20:08.730]  How they're dealing with major headaches right now other places are dealing with the exact same headaches because their shit tested at one percent thc
[20:09.530 --> 20:15.210]  Those seed sellers should potentially be held responsible. They knew if they offered something that wasn't as advertised
[20:15.290 --> 20:17.290]  There should be some recourse to the seed sellers
[20:18.170 --> 20:21.530]  I'm a seed maker. I hold myself responsible for that kind of a claim
[20:22.490 --> 20:29.130]  If this was a federally legal business operating with normal business practices, all that shit would just be in place
[20:30.010 --> 20:32.010]  Um, but it's not because
[20:32.650 --> 20:37.530]  Well, that's the second half of the show, right? Yep. Well, do you want to work our way into that mike? Um,
[20:38.250 --> 20:39.290]  segue
[20:39.290 --> 20:41.130]  Yeah, segue
[20:41.130 --> 20:44.090]  I'm, not going to drop that clip in I haven't used it yet, but we need it for somewhere
[20:44.090 --> 20:47.050]  Here's time to make a segue. Uh, this is the part where we're going to let
[20:47.290 --> 20:51.210]  Uh, mike work his way into a little bit of politics because it is voting time
[20:51.210 --> 20:53.050]  There's a lot of critical stuff happening
[20:53.050 --> 20:58.410]  I've got a platform with an audience and I feel it is almost my responsibility to educate and inform
[20:58.890 --> 21:02.890]  On other things than just cannabis. This is cannabis related. It's cannabis involved. It's important
[21:03.290 --> 21:08.490]  Uh, I think I can quit rambling and I can let mike start rambling a little bit
[21:08.570 --> 21:11.610]  The first thing I wrote down though, bro was uh political signs
[21:11.690 --> 21:16.410]  So if you want to tell us your story about your political signs and then we'll work it into the rest of your your stuff
[21:17.530 --> 21:19.530]  um with covid
[21:19.610 --> 21:21.850]  And everybody just being home most of the time
[21:22.650 --> 21:23.770]  um
[21:23.770 --> 21:26.490]  I our worlds have kind of collapsed in on each other
[21:27.130 --> 21:28.330]  and uh
[21:28.650 --> 21:29.450]  I don't know about y'all
[21:29.450 --> 21:34.890]  But one of the things I do to keep myself sane and keep the kids sane is we take little walks around the neighborhood
[21:35.770 --> 21:37.770]  not long walks just around the block and
[21:38.330 --> 21:42.410]  You know one week one one day we do the the right side of the block next week
[21:42.410 --> 21:44.970]  We do the left side of the block kind of loop around
[21:45.770 --> 21:50.650]  And we've watched the evolution of the political signs going up and down our street and around our neighborhood
[21:52.090 --> 21:54.970]  In this part of town, it's really chill. There's not a lot of signage
[21:55.930 --> 21:57.370]  and about
[21:57.370 --> 21:59.850]  Maybe two months ago six weeks ago
[22:00.570 --> 22:02.490]  one house on our street
[22:02.490 --> 22:06.990]  Puts out there was no trump sign at first. It started out with two local conservatives
[22:08.250 --> 22:10.650]  um, so like uh, um
[22:11.450 --> 22:14.650]  What is it a senator level and then a state rep level?
[22:15.370 --> 22:19.530]  Sign in the front yard and like two days later. There was a trump sign to go with it
[22:19.610 --> 22:21.610]  It seemed like he just didn't have the trump's sign yet
[22:23.290 --> 22:25.530]  And that was the only signs on our street for a minute
[22:26.250 --> 22:30.170]  And then I live right across the street from a military vet
[22:31.450 --> 22:33.450]  and
[22:34.970 --> 22:39.930]  One day I come home and he's definitely got where his american flag normally is
[22:40.570 --> 22:42.410]  There's a trump flag
[22:42.410 --> 22:46.810]  But it's a trump flag. I haven't seen before because it seems like it's trump on one side
[22:47.350 --> 22:53.130]  American flag on the other and i'm not great with flag etiquette, but immediately my brain was like
[22:54.090 --> 22:59.370]  Wait alarm bells that looks really weird. You should look at that more and figure out what the hell you're looking at
[23:00.810 --> 23:01.850]  so
[23:01.850 --> 23:03.130]  over the next
[23:03.130 --> 23:04.490]  two days
[23:04.490 --> 23:08.330]  It goes from trump flag on one side american flag on the other
[23:08.970 --> 23:10.970]  to double-sided american flag
[23:11.530 --> 23:13.530]  to double-sided trump flag
[23:13.850 --> 23:18.730]  And me and the wife are talking about this just laughing going. Is it a husband and wife fighting?
[23:20.010 --> 23:22.330]  Is it going up and coming down? Does the guy?
[23:23.210 --> 23:25.930]  Not sure about his support. What the hell is going on?
[23:26.970 --> 23:28.970]  And what it turns out is
[23:29.130 --> 23:31.130]  It's just badly hung up
[23:31.530 --> 23:33.530]  And it's a one-sided trump flag
[23:34.410 --> 23:39.290]  And again, just terrible flag etiquette. It's hung up. Um
[23:39.990 --> 23:45.210]  Overlaid on his american flag. He's got the american flag set up on the front of his house
[23:45.610 --> 23:49.610]  And he's just clipped the trump flag right next to it in the same guide rings
[23:50.170 --> 23:54.410]  And so depending on which way the wind's flapping or if it's hanging still
[23:54.730 --> 23:57.690]  It looks all it looks like six different flags at once
[23:59.610 --> 24:01.610]  So
[24:01.610 --> 24:06.250]  At this point in the story, there's the one house down the street with three little yard signs and the flag
[24:07.210 --> 24:14.010]  Then I go down the street and all of the houses around the first house have biden signs out. They've surrounded the dude
[24:14.090 --> 24:16.990]  Then two other people on the street put out biden flags
[24:17.770 --> 24:23.450]  Or not biden flags biden signs then next morning all of the biden signs are gone
[24:24.410 --> 24:27.290]  They just disappeared somebody came through and stole them all
[24:29.210 --> 24:33.690]  Two days later they're all back and everybody's doubled up now nice
[24:34.490 --> 24:37.850]  So i'm waiting to see that happened yesterday. Everybody doubled up
[24:38.410 --> 24:40.410]  So i'm waiting to see where this goes
[24:40.410 --> 24:42.410]  Between now and the election
[24:42.410 --> 24:46.330]  Like it's just a sad little thing. That's my weird little world right now people. Welcome to it
[24:46.970 --> 24:52.250]  Uh, I don't remember if it was you or another friend that told me that they watched a neighbor put some trump signs in
[24:52.330 --> 24:54.330]  the trash can
[24:54.330 --> 24:56.650]  Um, i've seen that story on a couple of different
[24:57.530 --> 25:01.130]  Platforms and a couple of different versions could have been fake and
[25:01.850 --> 25:03.850]  I may have fallen honestly crap
[25:04.410 --> 25:06.410]  This election's so bad shit
[25:06.410 --> 25:12.490]  That like there's all of it. Um, I saw one dude and when I saw this picture I was like
[25:13.610 --> 25:15.610]  Homie's kind of begging for trouble
[25:16.250 --> 25:19.450]  And when I saw the footage of the trouble that inevitably happened
[25:19.530 --> 25:24.250]  I was like and they had a camera set up to catch it homie was probably kind of begging for trouble
[25:24.810 --> 25:26.810]  But it was a huge like
[25:27.450 --> 25:29.450]  Semi-trailer like the big
[25:30.010 --> 25:33.850]  Full-size semi-trailer that was like a big truck full of people
[25:33.850 --> 25:35.050]  Like the big
[25:35.050 --> 25:35.990]  full-size
[25:35.990 --> 25:38.330]  Semi-trailer worth of hay bales stacked up
[25:38.730 --> 25:44.250]  And then a shitload of biden flags all over it and I don't remember what stated it was in but I remember thinking
[25:44.730 --> 25:48.570]  That's a pretty conservative area for such a giant biden display
[25:49.450 --> 25:53.450]  Made out of obviously flammable material seems like a bad idea
[25:54.410 --> 25:57.210]  I'm, sure as shit a few days later. It was on fire
[25:58.250 --> 25:59.210]  um
[25:59.210 --> 26:00.730]  So who knows?
[26:00.730 --> 26:04.970]  But just in our little area, it's it's fun. Just watching the neighborhood go
[26:05.610 --> 26:10.010]  My wife ordered a couple of biden flags and we haven't put them up yet because we don't want to be
[26:10.810 --> 26:13.930]  The like we don't want to one-up anybody and start to think
[26:14.810 --> 26:16.810]  Oh do it. It's like christmas decorations
[26:17.130 --> 26:19.870]  We're sticking to the yard sign until the yard sign disappears
[26:20.410 --> 26:23.930]  If somebody jacks the yard sign all five flags are going up. Fuck it
[26:25.290 --> 26:30.490]  You guys could be like, uh, like the fucking uh, fuck I lost it in my national lampoon's
[26:30.490 --> 26:33.290]  Christmas vacation, you could be like the guy hanging up super lights, bro
[26:34.410 --> 26:36.250]  yeah, it's uh
[26:36.250 --> 26:38.490]  It's tough. It's such a weird election because i'm not
[26:39.930 --> 26:43.130]  Like i'm not a super fan of of biden. I definitely
[26:44.090 --> 26:49.290]  Didn't pick biden in the primaries. He was I even remember saying to my dad clearly on a phone call
[26:49.290 --> 26:54.570]  It was back when all of the candidates were still in um right after bloomberg got in the race
[26:54.890 --> 26:58.190]  I was like, I don't know who it's gonna be right now, but I know it's not gonna be biden or bloomberg
[26:59.070 --> 27:04.990]  And we had like an hour-long conversation about how we were sure it wasn't gonna be either of those candidates oops, but uh
[27:06.350 --> 27:09.310]  Along this track while we're talking politics on a weed show
[27:10.030 --> 27:14.190]  Is the last episode I was on was my legalization primer
[27:14.830 --> 27:21.630]  And man, I don't know if I got too high or if my script lost a page, but I don't think I told you all to vote
[27:23.550 --> 27:26.110]  Fuck dude of all the things not to mention
[27:26.910 --> 27:28.110]  vote
[27:28.110 --> 27:30.110]  vote vote vote
[27:30.990 --> 27:32.990]  Most of the states that have
[27:33.070 --> 27:38.830]  Legal cannabis recreational legal cannabis. We got there because we have a system in place that allows
[27:39.610 --> 27:42.350]  Citizens to put questions directly on the ballot
[27:43.070 --> 27:46.190]  Citizens overcame whatever hurdles are in place to do that
[27:46.910 --> 27:50.110]  We got the word out. We convinced our parents to vote with us
[27:50.750 --> 27:52.750]  And we legalized it
[27:53.150 --> 27:56.990]  A lot of places where cannabis isn't recreationally legal
[27:57.710 --> 28:02.750]  You've got to elect people to office who will do all those first steps for you
[28:03.470 --> 28:06.830]  And right now that's a pain in the ass to get done
[28:09.290 --> 28:11.310]  Presidential candidate wise right now
[28:12.590 --> 28:16.530]  Another reason we're doing a political show on a cannabis podcast
[28:18.270 --> 28:24.450]  Both presidential campaigns trump and biden are now clear on their marijuana positions
[28:25.410 --> 28:27.410]  Um the biden campaign
[28:27.730 --> 28:29.890]  Their policy goal is decrim
[28:30.990 --> 28:32.370]  decriminalization
[28:32.370 --> 28:34.370]  no legalization
[28:35.010 --> 28:38.050]  No federal legalization. They just want to get the feds out of it
[28:39.170 --> 28:41.570]  um in my mind, it's a half step
[28:42.530 --> 28:49.570]  A lot of states have had decrim for a lot of years and we arrested a fuckload of people for marijuana crimes during that time
[28:50.290 --> 28:53.430]  Because decrim doesn't mean shit for production
[28:54.450 --> 28:59.970]  Um, and if you've got a whole ounce on you, they call that attempted dealing. Anyway, so right
[29:00.990 --> 29:02.990]  distribution
[29:04.610 --> 29:08.230]  Yeah, if you get caught with 29 grams of pot and sandwich baggies
[29:08.850 --> 29:10.850]  You're a major drug trafficker
[29:11.330 --> 29:13.330]  under a decrim model usually so
[29:14.290 --> 29:17.570]  It's I mean, it's a step forward. You can't say it's not
[29:18.370 --> 29:21.010]  But it's not legalization. It's not
[29:21.730 --> 29:23.330]  um
[29:23.330 --> 29:27.650]  Like if I was running for president, it wouldn't be my marijuana policy. That's for damn sure
[29:28.450 --> 29:33.730]  But it's a interrupt you and ask you what your marijuana policy would be mike
[29:35.150 --> 29:39.490]  Legalization just full out legalization just like cigarettes like other industries
[29:40.210 --> 29:43.410]  Probably not just like cigarettes, but similar. Um
[29:44.690 --> 29:49.090]  I finally quit smoking in january after like 20 something years. Congrats, bro. So
[29:49.490 --> 29:55.570]  Um i've been anti or i'm as anti tobacco now as i've ever been in my life
[29:56.370 --> 29:58.930]  not like violently anti tobacco or anything, but
[29:59.730 --> 30:01.730]  I see them at least favorably
[30:02.370 --> 30:06.370]  And i've never liked that particular regulation model
[30:07.010 --> 30:08.290]  It's not
[30:08.290 --> 30:14.930]  Bad, but it's not good either. We can do better. I think we've already done better with colorado's marijuana model. Okay?
[30:15.330 --> 30:17.250]  um
[30:17.250 --> 30:22.290]  I wouldn't just blanket take colorado's model and push it over all the states either
[30:23.170 --> 30:24.610]  um
[30:24.610 --> 30:27.570]  We've definitely made mistakes. Oh for sure. Um
[30:28.290 --> 30:32.290]  Some we're working to correct now. Some people are gleefully making worse
[30:33.410 --> 30:35.970]  But uh, I think we're better than most places
[30:37.090 --> 30:40.530]  Um, and I think if if there was a presidential candidate right now
[30:41.090 --> 30:47.170]  That said we're gonna push colorado's model on all 50 states like i'd be looking to get a tattoo of that person's name
[30:48.050 --> 30:50.050]  I'd be so fucking excited
[30:50.210 --> 30:52.210]  Where are you gonna put it?
[30:52.450 --> 30:54.450]  I don't know my throat
[30:56.960 --> 31:04.160]  Biden 420 right across your neck, bro. No, it's uh, I mean honestly for a long time
[31:04.800 --> 31:06.560]  Uh
[31:06.560 --> 31:13.440]  Drug legalization policy wonk like me voting for biden fucking hurts. I'm not gonna say it doesn't
[31:14.080 --> 31:16.000]  but uh
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.360]  Um, we've covered their proposal now, let's talk about the opposition. Yes. Um,
[31:22.400 --> 31:24.400]  which is weird calling the
[31:25.120 --> 31:28.240]  the party in the the white house the opposition at all, but uh
[31:29.200 --> 31:33.840]  Um trump has said positive things towards legalization in the past
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.800]  Um, he's said lots of positive things about medical marijuana in the past
[31:39.600 --> 31:41.600]  and he's currently
[31:41.600 --> 31:46.020]  Sending threatening cease and desist letters to a medical marijuana campaign
[31:46.640 --> 31:48.720]  and a legalization campaign
[31:49.440 --> 31:51.520]  Because they're accurately quoting him
[31:52.140 --> 31:57.140]  Threatening them to stop using things. He said that support the cause they're supporting
[31:58.400 --> 32:01.520]  um pretty clear he's anti-cannabis he sided with
[32:02.240 --> 32:05.120]  the rest of the right politically here in his
[32:05.740 --> 32:07.740]  anti-cannabis, just like
[32:08.080 --> 32:12.320]  we've had all through american history since the late 1800s, so
[32:13.520 --> 32:16.800]  Such a weird thing to do voting based on just cannabis
[32:18.320 --> 32:20.160]  There's your sign
[32:20.160 --> 32:24.800]  I like the way you wrapped that up and made that a peaceful division if you're voting for cannabis
[32:25.200 --> 32:27.200]  Mike knows who you should vote for. I think you do by now
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.520]  uh, that's really a weird approach to it to
[32:29.920 --> 32:35.040]  Send a cease and desist to say you can't even use my quotes that I said in your campaign
[32:35.120 --> 32:40.480]  Even though what I said is real like how can you cock block somebody that story broke today truth?
[32:41.680 --> 32:46.080]  um, check out marijuana moment for in-depth reporting on this story, but uh
[32:48.080 --> 32:52.560]  I saw the headline and I went that's fucking stupid. Yeah, like that's
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.520]  That is almost
[32:55.520 --> 33:00.640]  Advertising is insanely popular. It's more advertising for the campaign. That was
[33:01.200 --> 33:06.000]  That he's against now that campaign would have gotten a little bit of advertising legs
[33:06.000 --> 33:06.560]  You know what? I mean?
[33:06.560 --> 33:09.280]  However much they paid for now it's got trump money behind it
[33:09.520 --> 33:12.080]  It's fucking it only would have gotten so far and fizzled out now
[33:12.080 --> 33:16.160]  It's gotten a whole another got picked up and rethrown down the field. They got a whole nother throw
[33:16.880 --> 33:21.360]  Fucking funny reason people like me are reading about it is because it's so weird
[33:22.240 --> 33:29.120]  Um medical marijuana is supported by like 60 80 percent of the people depending on which people you're talking about
[33:29.920 --> 33:33.920]  It's wildly popular. I mean, it's popular like ice cream
[33:34.480 --> 33:36.960]  Yeah, it's it's insanely popular
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.620]  It's disturbing that it's still illegal federally and there's still so many restrictions on it despite its popularity
[33:44.800 --> 33:46.160]  with the voters
[33:46.160 --> 33:48.880]  but it's I mean, it's a contentious election we're
[33:49.760 --> 33:55.600]  Two weeks out now and to just slap that many people for no reason none
[33:57.520 --> 34:00.400]  It wasn't like anybody was pointing to these quotes and
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.320]  It wasn't causing a problem for their campaign or anything. It wasn't even contentious. It wasn't news at all
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.100]  Until they sent a cease and desist letter that was angry and threatening
[34:10.720 --> 34:16.880]  And now it's just national news. It's so funny. Yeah that that ad campaign just expanded tenfold
[34:17.760 --> 34:20.900]  Well, I know a shitload of conservative cannabis fanatics
[34:21.760 --> 34:24.580]  um, they love cannabis and they love vote republican
[34:25.360 --> 34:27.040]  and
[34:27.040 --> 34:28.720]  That's gotta suck
[34:28.720 --> 34:35.200]  Like i'm sorry. I'm not not even trying to be a dick. I know a lot of republicans my i've got republicans in my family
[34:36.400 --> 34:37.680]  um
[34:37.680 --> 34:41.840]  I'm liberal about a lot of stuff, but i'm conservative about a lot of stuff too. Just not any social issues
[34:42.480 --> 34:44.480]  um, like i'm a gun nut too, so
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.040]  Dude, I wasn't gonna bring that up. I'm all about cannabis and i'm all about a lot of things
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.480]  I'm, not even gonna mention but I think if you want to have a gun have a fucking gun
[34:52.880 --> 34:56.960]  Like you should have all about freedoms. Yeah do the things that you want to do. That's the thing
[34:56.960 --> 34:58.480]  I like is freedom don't fuck with me
[34:58.480 --> 35:03.760]  Don't fuck with other people as long as my freedom isn't fucking with your freedom and we aren't stepping on each other in any
[35:03.760 --> 35:09.120]  Other way, let's fucking freedom bro. Let's have a good ass time hugs and dabs and guns and fucking
[35:09.600 --> 35:13.360]  Yeah, love who you want fucking love what you want fucking yeah, dude
[35:14.160 --> 35:15.280]  Yeah
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.680]  Your shit ain't my business. My shit ain't your business like let's have a good time and be ourselves
[35:20.480 --> 35:23.120]  What I definitely wanted to get on the show and do
[35:23.840 --> 35:29.920]  A little here's where the candidates are at peace for uh for the growth of the heart community the iry army
[35:30.640 --> 35:31.760]  um
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.520]  I know y'all look to me for some of that stuff and I appreciate it and
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.400]  If you were on the fence and looking for a cannabis reason to vote a or b
[35:41.520 --> 35:43.520]  um, there you go
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.080]  I think most of the audience watching the dreadlocked white guy with the cannabis show were already
[35:48.320 --> 35:54.560]  Uh, most of them have probably already made their decisions, but hopefully maybe we encouraged a small portion of people
[35:54.880 --> 35:59.200]  Maybe we just divided ourselves from some of our friends. But either way, uh, we are who we are
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.600]  Hope you enjoyed the show, uh, mike. Thank you, dude
[36:01.600 --> 36:04.320]  Thank you for your contribution to the show the community for what you do
[36:04.320 --> 36:06.320]  You look like you got something to say go for it
[36:06.480 --> 36:08.400]  well, just
[36:08.400 --> 36:09.920]  the group of
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.480]  In our community that I really reaching out to are the group that don't vote
[36:15.120 --> 36:16.880]  or the group that
[36:16.880 --> 36:20.720]  Hate left and right so they vote third party or don't vote at all
[36:21.680 --> 36:22.720]  um
[36:22.720 --> 36:24.720]  or the people that think
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.040]  Everything sucks. So why bother?
[36:27.520 --> 36:31.600]  Like it's literally just made up of people. It's just us
[36:32.400 --> 36:33.680]  like
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.040]  It's weird to think that if me and jeff are a little older and a lot less stony
[36:37.600 --> 36:39.500]  like we could be
[36:39.500 --> 36:41.020]  senators or
[36:41.020 --> 36:47.280]  Presidents or yep. I compared the justices or the people that say that voting doesn't matter
[36:47.520 --> 36:50.960]  Um, those are the people that if I took you to a restaurant and I gave you the menu and you're like
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.720]  I don't care just bring me something if I bring you fucking mashed potatoes and chicken wings
[36:55.040 --> 36:57.120]  That's what you fucking get. That's what you're stuck with
[36:57.200 --> 37:01.520]  If you would have voted you could have looked at the menu and maybe you could have said I want
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.120]  Soup and a salad and I could have considered that instead you didn't even bother to show up and fucking voice your opinion
[37:07.280 --> 37:12.800]  So you got fucking cold mashed potatoes and fucking chicken wings, dude. I hope you're happy being a four-year-old at the table
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.880]  Well, it's I mean it's brutal for people like like i'm crazy liberal about a lot of stuff
[37:19.680 --> 37:20.720]  um
[37:20.720 --> 37:24.560]  Like biden and obama before him are very center
[37:25.260 --> 37:28.500]  Politically like there's a left and a right when you talk about politics
[37:29.140 --> 37:31.460]  And they're smacking the fucking middle center
[37:31.940 --> 37:35.140]  Um between right and left. We don't really have a left
[37:35.780 --> 37:40.180]  As far as parties are concerned in the u.s. We have a center and we have a far to the right
[37:41.060 --> 37:45.220]  Um and over our my lifetime our lifetimes we've watched
[37:45.860 --> 37:49.060]  It go from a little left of center and right of center
[37:49.620 --> 37:53.060]  To way way right of center and smack dead middle
[37:53.860 --> 37:55.860]  and a lot of that has to do with
[37:56.420 --> 37:57.380]  um
[37:57.380 --> 38:01.000]  Young people tend to be more liberal on stuff and more left-leaning
[38:01.700 --> 38:06.280]  And just don't vote in primaries and small races and small elections
[38:07.380 --> 38:09.140]  um
[38:09.140 --> 38:12.180]  Turnout's getting much better for the presidential elections, but
[38:12.900 --> 38:14.740]  in the primaries
[38:14.740 --> 38:16.420]  It's minimal
[38:16.420 --> 38:20.180]  And that's like everybody's like man. I wish I was voting for bernie
[38:20.820 --> 38:22.500]  It's like well
[38:22.500 --> 38:28.520]  Dude's been in congress as long as biden. He just never built that coalition of people that are gonna go nuts in the primary
[38:29.380 --> 38:33.000]  It's that younger voter base. We've got to get out to the other elections
[38:33.700 --> 38:37.460]  And it's just not happening right now and for the cannabis community
[38:38.420 --> 38:40.420]  We're so fucking big
[38:40.660 --> 38:42.900]  If we could unify even for a minute
[38:43.780 --> 38:45.780]  It would change shit globally
[38:46.820 --> 38:48.020]  but
[38:48.020 --> 38:50.340]  It's so hard to get us on the same page about anything man
[38:50.980 --> 38:58.500]  Yeah, uh, the simpsons nailed it, uh south park nailed it, uh family guy nailed it i'm gonna vote to legalize cannabis
[38:58.820 --> 39:00.820]  That was yesterday, bro
[39:00.880 --> 39:07.300]  Unfortunately, that's how a lot of us play the game. Um, you guys pick up a pick up a stoner friend. Yep. Do it mike
[39:08.020 --> 39:13.300]  Get out and vote get your friends out to vote. Make sure they're registered. Make sure they go down election day
[39:13.860 --> 39:16.820]  Get in line together sit there and bullshit together if you have to
[39:17.700 --> 39:18.500]  um
[39:18.500 --> 39:22.660]  Social media will help you register to vote instagram and facebook are making it simple
[39:22.820 --> 39:28.260]  Just click if you open up one of those apps or everybody's on either instagram or facebook or something on your phone
[39:28.340 --> 39:33.700]  Every app you open right now on the top. It's like are you registered to vote because they want you to participate do it
[39:33.700 --> 39:38.820]  It's easy if you're still not registered to vote. It's because you're actively ducking it
[39:39.460 --> 39:43.080]  Like it's they're making it as easy as it's ever been in our lifetimes
[39:44.180 --> 39:45.220]  um
[39:45.220 --> 39:47.700]  I feel for places where i'm watching people
[39:48.500 --> 39:51.780]  Wait, five six eight eleven hours to vote
[39:52.580 --> 39:54.420]  even this early
[39:54.420 --> 39:57.940]  And people are showing up and wrecking numbers all over the country
[39:58.820 --> 40:02.200]  Um, they're waiting in huge lines and in colorado
[40:03.540 --> 40:08.340]  I think the longest i've waited in the last 10 years to vote is like 15 minutes
[40:08.980 --> 40:11.860]  And part of that was because the elevator's slow in the building
[40:12.740 --> 40:16.660]  Uh this year it took me about five minutes, uh open up the ballot
[40:16.980 --> 40:19.300]  Scribble in some bubbles because I know who i'm looking for
[40:19.620 --> 40:22.980]  Go ahead and scribble all my marks fold it back up sign it put it in an envelope
[40:23.220 --> 40:25.300]  And then a few blocks from my house. There's a little uh,
[40:26.080 --> 40:26.820]  Unfortunately, bro
[40:26.820 --> 40:29.860]  They took a big trash can and fucking put a lid on it poked a hole in it
[40:30.100 --> 40:34.900]  And that is the official ballot box, uh before you put your ballots, but you drop them all in there
[40:35.460 --> 40:38.980]  Uh, yeah, so it took me just a couple minutes and drove up jumped out of the car
[40:39.620 --> 40:42.900]  Collection box man. Yep took a couple more. It's more secure than it looks
[40:43.780 --> 40:44.500]  Yeah, yeah
[40:44.500 --> 40:50.180]  It's much more secure than it looks took two with me so that some other people didn't have to go out and face coveted conditions
[40:50.340 --> 40:55.300]  So they could just stay on the couch and watch the game. So I got three ballots delivered all in one move
[40:55.460 --> 40:58.020]  Yeah, I was gonna say if you guys are out there and you need to vote
[40:58.340 --> 41:02.660]  Uh go or if you got a stoner friend that won't vote go pick them up take them to vote help them to do it
[41:02.820 --> 41:04.180]  A lot of us got ballots in the mail
[41:04.180 --> 41:06.900]  Just go over to their house and help them fill that shit out make it fun
[41:07.300 --> 41:11.380]  Uh teach them and if you don't vote you don't get to bitch and complain about how things are that's just how it is
[41:12.180 --> 41:13.780]  yeah, it's
[41:13.780 --> 41:18.580]  Like literally if you if you say that it sucks, so you don't participate like you're the reason it sucks
[41:19.940 --> 41:26.580]  It's it's your choices. It's people not voting are why shitty people stay in elected office forever
[41:27.220 --> 41:31.220]  um, it's because familiarity is comforting and
[41:32.020 --> 41:37.460]  People just don't vote in nor in the numbers they need to it's bananas like
[41:39.220 --> 41:46.420]  Our country seeks out other countries when they vote and we put it on the news and we clap and applaud when they vote
[41:47.380 --> 41:50.820]  But we don't go turn out to vote. It's so fucking weird
[41:51.700 --> 41:55.380]  Um, please go vote. Yes, please. Please. Please go vote
[41:56.180 --> 41:57.220]  um
[41:57.220 --> 42:00.180]  I don't even care who you vote for just get out and vote make your wizard
[42:00.340 --> 42:04.340]  Just go participate and it's not that hard to do. It's not once you're there. It's real easy
[42:04.420 --> 42:07.060]  I said earlier a lot of people can vote on you can't do it online
[42:07.140 --> 42:09.620]  You can do through the mail right now. Your ballot comes in the mail. You just gotta
[42:10.820 --> 42:14.420]  System so easy. Yeah, if you don't know anything other
[42:15.220 --> 42:17.220]  Than that you're registered
[42:17.380 --> 42:21.140]  When the ballot shows up at your house, if that's all you know is that you want to vote
[42:22.020 --> 42:25.940]  When the ballot shows up at your house, you've got all the time in the world to sit there and
[42:26.740 --> 42:32.820]  What's joe biden think about this spend a couple hours on his page spend a couple hours watching videos of him talk?
[42:33.220 --> 42:38.580]  What's trump think a couple hours watching him talk if y'all have seen a ballot so far in this election
[42:38.660 --> 42:43.460]  You know that those two aren't the only two listed under who do you want to vote for for president?
[42:43.780 --> 42:48.900]  Maybe y'all want to vote for kanye check out his platform. Please don't vote for that shit
[42:49.300 --> 42:51.300]  But uh
[42:51.860 --> 42:52.980]  um
[42:52.980 --> 42:57.860]  It's so nice. I was thinking looking at the ballot this year with all the different questions on it
[42:57.860 --> 43:00.820]  What a pain in the ass it would be if you had to go stay in a voting booth
[43:01.300 --> 43:05.860]  And know all that stuff. Yeah, I definitely want a crib sheet before I went into the voting booth
[43:06.420 --> 43:09.860]  Which is perfectly legal. I made one before I even started voting
[43:10.340 --> 43:15.380]  Like I had a paper like a guideline to help me while I was doing my own ballot so I didn't make any mistakes
[43:16.100 --> 43:16.980]  um
[43:16.980 --> 43:18.340]  What was I gonna say helpful?
[43:18.340 --> 43:20.820]  You don't have to fill in all the bubbles if you don't know one
[43:21.300 --> 43:24.660]  You don't have to fill in everything if there's some local shit that you're like
[43:24.740 --> 43:29.140]  I don't even know what the fuck that means. You don't just skip it. It's not a test in school
[43:29.380 --> 43:33.620]  Just you can vote for the president and whoever else you want that you're comfortable with and there's like
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.140]  170 fucking bubbles on there fill out five of them. You'll be okay
[43:38.100 --> 43:39.780]  There were two people
[43:39.780 --> 43:46.200]  Locally this round that I do not like his people and I do not like his candidates who were running unopposed
[43:46.840 --> 43:48.840]  And so they didn't get a vote for me
[43:48.980 --> 43:53.720]  Exactly. Um, they're running unopposed. It doesn't matter like there's nobody to vote against
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.120]  but uh
[43:56.120 --> 44:01.320]  They don't get my vote and on election night. They're gonna see it because they're gonna get they report it
[44:01.320 --> 44:03.320]  If you watch the news, it's called an undervote
[44:03.960 --> 44:07.160]  and uh, they they list it for like
[44:08.040 --> 44:09.160]  um
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.520]  Say for example biden voters in in our area
[44:13.080 --> 44:19.000]  The people down the ticket democrat if they get less votes than biden did they list it as an undervote
[44:19.400 --> 44:23.340]  And so it can be like jeff got a thousand votes. Mike only got 740
[44:24.440 --> 44:27.720]  And it'll say it underneath that i'm pointed out as an undervote
[44:28.280 --> 44:31.240]  So yeah, fuck them. That's my little dig to them. Nice
[44:31.960 --> 44:35.880]  You could have just wrote my name in in the in the opposition spot and voted for me, bro
[44:36.680 --> 44:38.680]  Uh
[44:38.920 --> 44:40.440]  Missed opportunity
[44:40.440 --> 44:45.880]  Yes people, please vote you all like when we ramble right now. We're rambling about voting just get out and vote
[44:46.120 --> 44:51.400]  Yes, and I promise you the next podcast will be heavily cannabis oriented if you've made it this far
[44:51.480 --> 44:54.920]  You probably aren't too concerned about that. Uh, and I try not to let my
[44:55.460 --> 44:59.000]  Cannabis-y people checked out. No, they're already gone if they no offense to you
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.600]  Mike if they're interested in cannabis only they've already checked out. They won't even know I see the video numbers on youtube. It's cool
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.840]  Yeah, uh, no I have you here because you may not get all of the viewers
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.720]  But the few that do stick around for you not the few the the kind folks that do they fucking love you
[45:13.720 --> 45:17.800]  You've got a cult. So we're always going to have you on the white mic division of the iry army
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.520]  It sounds weird. So let's not put it that way again
[45:24.040 --> 45:29.080]  But yeah, you're you're a little sect is uh, you definitely have your own little your club in the back of the club
[45:29.240 --> 45:32.760]  So I love it. I appreciate it folks. Thank you very much. And uh
[45:33.560 --> 45:38.200]  I absolutely love all the shout outs and the the support I get through emails and patreon and
[45:38.920 --> 45:44.120]  Um, feel free to reach out to me. I I like chatting and i'm stuck at home with the kids all the time
[45:44.200 --> 45:45.880]  So i'll probably reply
[45:45.880 --> 45:48.760]  If you're going to tell them how to to reach out you got to tell them how to do it

[46:13.240 --> 46:17.880]  Um, what I was gonna say was oh support mike on patreon. I do all the cool kids are doing it
[46:18.200 --> 46:22.840]  You should do it for some reason mike typedd in 720. So i'm giving him 720 and not 710 a month
[46:22.840 --> 46:24.840]  I don't know if he did that on purpose
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.840]  but
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.640]  Just slapping it together there and since you're a 311 fan i'm surprised you don't have a 311 tier
[46:31.880 --> 46:35.480]  That was just the thing. I thought you should that's one of the new tiers that's going in on
[46:35.720 --> 46:39.720]  I have a little list planned out of different stuff. I want to do with the patreon
[46:39.720 --> 46:42.840]  but if y'all have any ideas feel free to shoot it to me because i'm
[46:43.640 --> 46:50.360]  Kind of reaching i've got new stuff coming up and there will be more patreon things involved with what's coming up. I just I
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.240]  I smile so much when I think about it. I've done so many cool things. They're coming up. I can't reveal it yet
[46:55.480 --> 46:58.520]  I'm the kind of guy that like if I built a new car from the ground up
[46:58.520 --> 47:03.080]  You wouldn't see that car until it had nitrous in it and I was fucking flying down the track would be the debut
[47:03.400 --> 47:05.240]  And my shit doesn't have nitrous and wheels yet
[47:05.240 --> 47:11.160]  So once we put some wheels on this bitch, we will put it on the track and we'll fucking flex. Don't worry. I'm ready
[47:11.640 --> 47:14.520]  Uh, but support mike, uh, that's where I think I was going with that

[49:09.660 --> 49:14.780]  I'll leave the politics and the nonsense out of the next one. This one was very important in my opinion. Thank you

[49:16.540 --> 49:19.500]  I want to give a big shout out to a listener who goes by jg
