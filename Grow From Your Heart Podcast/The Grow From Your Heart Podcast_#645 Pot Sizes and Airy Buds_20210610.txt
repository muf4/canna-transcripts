[00:09.040 --> 00:14.040]  and this is episode 645 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:14.960 --> 00:17.720]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on grow questions.
[00:17.720 --> 00:19.640]  Before we get to those grow questions,
[00:19.640 --> 00:22.160]  let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks

[01:25.300 --> 01:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the show.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.660]  It was a beautiful day today.
[01:29.660 --> 01:32.300]  I hope it was beautiful wherever you are,
[01:33.140 --> 01:34.060]  wherever you were hanging out today,
[01:34.060 --> 01:36.620]  whatever you were doing, I hope you had a wonderful day.
[01:36.620 --> 01:38.300]  I wanna talk about this weather.
[01:38.300 --> 01:40.020]  This weather had people out and about.
[01:40.020 --> 01:42.940]  People are getting ready for their outdoor grow.
[01:42.940 --> 01:44.320]  I went to the grow store today
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.500]  and the grow store was super busy.
[01:47.500 --> 01:49.280]  There were a lot of people in there.
[01:49.280 --> 01:53.160]  Some people wearing masks, some people not wearing masks.
[01:53.160 --> 01:54.900]  I said masks, weird.
[01:54.900 --> 01:57.780]  Anyway, some people seem to have decided
[01:57.780 --> 01:59.180]  that the pandemic is over.
[01:59.180 --> 02:00.900]  Some are still participating.
[02:00.940 --> 02:03.740]  I'm not going down that avenue in this conversation.
[02:03.740 --> 02:06.380]  Just noticed that people are crowding the stores.
[02:06.380 --> 02:07.940]  Places are getting busy.
[02:07.940 --> 02:10.500]  At the grow store, one thing I did notice,
[02:10.500 --> 02:12.380]  shit is out of stock.
[02:12.380 --> 02:15.900]  They did not have a lot of the products I went for.
[02:15.900 --> 02:18.720]  They didn't have the first choice products I went for.
[02:18.720 --> 02:19.920]  I've always got a backup plan.
[02:19.920 --> 02:22.500]  They did not have the soilless mix I prefer to buy.
[02:22.500 --> 02:24.600]  They did not have the base nutrients I wanted to buy.
[02:24.600 --> 02:26.860]  They didn't have a pesticide I was looking for.
[02:26.860 --> 02:28.700]  They were out of rapid rooters.
[02:28.700 --> 02:31.100]  It was slim pickings at the grow store today.
[02:31.100 --> 02:33.500]  It was like all the B and C rate products were on the shelf
[02:33.500 --> 02:35.820]  and all the A rate shit has been bought.
[02:35.820 --> 02:37.300]  It has been taken.
[02:37.300 --> 02:38.460]  They were waiting for trucks.
[02:38.460 --> 02:39.960]  They did not know when shit was coming.
[02:39.960 --> 02:42.500]  I went to another store, same story over there.
[02:42.500 --> 02:44.680]  I really think all the shit was on the same truck
[02:44.680 --> 02:46.460]  going to all of the grow stores.
[02:46.460 --> 02:47.300]  They're waiting.
[02:47.300 --> 02:48.620]  The shit is just not coming.
[02:48.620 --> 02:51.900]  So you guys have a backup plan is what I'm getting at.
[02:51.900 --> 02:53.740]  If you were out there shopping for grow supplies,
[02:53.740 --> 02:56.220]  if you were stubborn about what you use in the grow,
[02:56.220 --> 02:58.140]  this is not gonna be the season for you.
[02:58.580 --> 02:59.820]  Whether you're growing indoors or outdoors,
[02:59.820 --> 03:01.900]  you're going to need to be flexible
[03:01.900 --> 03:05.260]  because this COVID situation, the pandemic, the quarantine,
[03:05.260 --> 03:08.980]  all the weird shutdowns and shit have made supplies scarce.
[03:08.980 --> 03:09.900]  They're more expensive.
[03:09.900 --> 03:11.220]  They're harder to get.
[03:11.220 --> 03:12.660]  And it's gonna take you a little longer
[03:12.660 --> 03:13.860]  to get the things you're sourcing.
[03:13.860 --> 03:16.220]  If you can even find your favorite products,
[03:16.220 --> 03:18.420]  you may need to find a backup plan,
[03:18.420 --> 03:19.880]  get the second product,
[03:19.880 --> 03:21.820]  that thing you've been wondering if it works.
[03:21.820 --> 03:24.580]  Now may be the time for you to find out if that shit works,
[03:24.580 --> 03:25.860]  which could work out.
[03:25.860 --> 03:27.180]  Sometimes that's how you find out
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.860]  that that other product is better
[03:28.860 --> 03:30.860]  or did something you didn't know it did.
[03:30.860 --> 03:32.380]  Maybe you'll find some cool shit,
[03:32.380 --> 03:33.700]  but have a backup plan.
[03:33.700 --> 03:35.940]  You guys, if you've got an outdoor grow coming up,
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.180]  go get your shit now.
[03:37.180 --> 03:39.500]  Don't wait because shit is selling out.
[03:39.500 --> 03:41.700]  Literally the guanos were selling out.
[03:41.700 --> 03:43.860]  Shit was flying off the shelves.
[03:43.860 --> 03:45.460]  The fish shit was gone.
[03:45.460 --> 03:48.380]  All of the mammoth pee, all that shit,
[03:48.380 --> 03:50.380]  it's all gone off the shelves right now, you guys,
[03:50.380 --> 03:51.820]  at least in my location.
[03:51.820 --> 03:55.440]  So get on it, get yourself some supplies.
[03:55.440 --> 03:57.560]  While I was at the grow store,
[03:57.560 --> 03:58.580]  I was asked a question.
[03:58.580 --> 04:00.200]  I did take a little bit of a note here on my phone.
[04:00.200 --> 04:01.180]  I'm not texting anybody.
[04:01.180 --> 04:03.480]  I'm not hanging out on any chat.
[04:03.480 --> 04:05.260]  I'm actually reading a message on the phone.
[04:05.260 --> 04:06.420]  I did take some notes.
[04:07.440 --> 04:09.440]  At the grow store, I got asked,
[04:09.440 --> 04:13.400]  can you explain why transplanting a plant is a good idea?
[04:13.400 --> 04:15.680]  This person wanted to, they were wondering,
[04:15.680 --> 04:18.120]  the word that I wanna use is graduating the pots.
[04:18.120 --> 04:20.400]  They wanted to just go from a paper towel
[04:20.400 --> 04:21.600]  when they germinate their seed
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.360]  into their big seven gallon finisher pot.
[04:24.360 --> 04:27.320]  And they were asking me why I recommend up potting
[04:27.320 --> 04:30.280]  from a small container to a medium sized,
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.680]  maybe bigger than into that seven.
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.180]  I would do it a couple of different ways,
[04:34.180 --> 04:36.400]  depending on the time, space, environment,
[04:36.400 --> 04:37.860]  the requirements for the room.
[04:37.860 --> 04:39.080]  There are a lot of different challenges
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.520]  and things we would face here.
[04:40.520 --> 04:43.520]  But they were asking how and why
[04:43.520 --> 04:46.200]  we would go about doing different pot sizes.
[04:46.200 --> 04:47.120]  Why do we do that?
[04:47.120 --> 04:49.200]  Why wouldn't I just put my seedling,
[04:49.200 --> 04:52.160]  this little tiny seedling, into a seven gallon pot
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.040]  filled with soilless mix or cocoa
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.280]  or whatever we've chosen to use?
[04:55.280 --> 04:57.160]  Why can't I just go into the straight pot?
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.160]  You can, but think about all of the water
[05:00.160 --> 05:02.800]  it's going to take to water that big pot.
[05:02.800 --> 05:04.400]  You don't need to use that much water.
[05:04.400 --> 05:06.080]  You could put that seedling
[05:06.080 --> 05:08.080]  inside of a little teeny tiny pot
[05:08.080 --> 05:10.000]  and you only have to water that little section,
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.340]  which gives you less opportunity for over watering.
[05:13.340 --> 05:15.960]  You're gonna have less space to disrupt.
[05:15.960 --> 05:17.640]  You're not gonna have to pour a gallon of water in there.
[05:17.640 --> 05:19.080]  You can just pour a little bit of water in there
[05:19.080 --> 05:21.300]  and that seedling will get the water that it needs.
[05:21.300 --> 05:23.740]  Also, that's that much less cocoa
[05:23.740 --> 05:24.980]  that you have to use right now.
[05:24.980 --> 05:26.580]  If you don't need that much cocoa,
[05:26.580 --> 05:28.500]  you don't have to buy that much cocoa.
[05:28.500 --> 05:31.500]  So you don't have to put a little seedling in a big pot.
[05:31.500 --> 05:33.180]  Then you're not gonna risk over watering it.
[05:33.180 --> 05:34.340]  That's one of the main issues.
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.980]  Over watering in that big pot will be easy
[05:36.980 --> 05:38.460]  because how much water,
[05:38.460 --> 05:40.660]  how much of that big pot do I need to water?
[05:40.660 --> 05:41.620]  You're gonna try to just water
[05:41.620 --> 05:42.760]  that little space right there,
[05:42.760 --> 05:43.900]  but then the roots are gonna grow
[05:43.900 --> 05:45.520]  and you're always gonna be chasing it.
[05:45.520 --> 05:46.720]  I start off, honestly,
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.920]  you've seen me do my clones in a beer cup.
[05:48.920 --> 05:52.040]  I start off in a beer cup or a four or six inch net pot
[05:52.040 --> 05:53.760]  is what I will start a seedling in.
[05:53.760 --> 05:54.760]  I'll let it grow in there
[05:54.760 --> 05:56.700]  until it becomes nearly root bound.
[05:56.700 --> 05:59.140]  I want it just pressing up against the walls there.
[05:59.140 --> 06:00.220]  I want the roots to say, hey,
[06:00.220 --> 06:03.220]  it is time for some new shoes before they get new shoes.
[06:04.880 --> 06:06.080]  So another reason I like that
[06:06.080 --> 06:08.840]  is a faster wet and dry time.
[06:08.840 --> 06:11.120]  I don't like my plants staying wet for too long.
[06:11.120 --> 06:13.400]  I like them not like dry,
[06:13.400 --> 06:15.040]  but I don't want them soggy the whole time.
[06:15.040 --> 06:17.600]  I want there to be availability for oxygen
[06:17.600 --> 06:18.480]  in that root space.
[06:19.000 --> 06:19.840]  So when they dry out a little bit,
[06:19.840 --> 06:20.660]  there's room for air.
[06:20.660 --> 06:21.920]  When there's too much water in there,
[06:21.920 --> 06:23.120]  the water takes all the space
[06:23.120 --> 06:24.560]  where the oxygen would be in the plants
[06:24.560 --> 06:25.440]  don't get as much air.
[06:25.440 --> 06:27.440]  I think oxygen to the root space
[06:27.440 --> 06:29.580]  really encourages root growth, happy plants.
[06:29.580 --> 06:31.960]  They eat more, they feed better, they perform better.
[06:31.960 --> 06:34.660]  So a smaller pot gives me a little bit
[06:34.660 --> 06:37.560]  of a faster wet and dry cycle.
[06:37.560 --> 06:38.960]  And in a smaller pot, that's good
[06:38.960 --> 06:40.480]  because I just want those roots to grow.
[06:40.480 --> 06:41.420]  I want the plants to grow
[06:41.420 --> 06:44.600]  so I can get them into their bigger pots sooner.
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.800]  So we've got these little plants,
[06:45.800 --> 06:46.720]  put them in a little cup,
[06:46.720 --> 06:47.960]  put them in a little pot,
[06:48.920 --> 06:50.520]  water them less often.
[06:50.520 --> 06:52.440]  Also, if you're watering less space,
[06:52.440 --> 06:53.900]  you're wasting less nutrients.
[06:53.900 --> 06:55.720]  You don't have to mix up as much food.
[06:55.720 --> 06:58.260]  You're not gonna water a seven gallon pot worth of space
[06:58.260 --> 06:59.660]  and only get the middle.
[06:59.660 --> 07:01.040]  You could have mixed up a little bit
[07:01.040 --> 07:03.080]  and just watered that one small cup.
[07:03.080 --> 07:05.160]  So I think starting off small,
[07:05.160 --> 07:06.960]  I would start with a cup, excuse me,
[07:06.960 --> 07:07.800]  I would start with a cup
[07:07.800 --> 07:10.200]  and then work my way into maybe a one gallon
[07:10.200 --> 07:11.180]  or a three gallon.
[07:11.180 --> 07:12.160]  And then that three gallon
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.520]  would either go into a five or a seven.
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.080]  So I do a cup or a one or a cup into a one.
[07:18.080 --> 07:20.880]  And then that one or the cup into the three gallon
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.540]  or into the five gallon or the three gallon into a seven.
[07:23.540 --> 07:25.120]  I kind of just work my way up.
[07:25.120 --> 07:27.600]  I don't like to go too big, too fast.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.440]  I like them to grow in there
[07:28.440 --> 07:30.160]  and get a little bit root bound.
[07:30.160 --> 07:32.260]  I was saying I want them kind of pushing the edge.
[07:32.260 --> 07:34.600]  I want them, like if they were a size 13 shoe,
[07:34.600 --> 07:36.480]  I want them in a 12 and a half.
[07:36.480 --> 07:38.680]  Like I want to be like, hey bro, can I get my 13s?
[07:38.680 --> 07:40.840]  And then we'll upgrade them right when they're ready.
[07:40.840 --> 07:42.500]  And then when I take them out of the pot,
[07:42.500 --> 07:44.760]  I kind of, from the bottom,
[07:44.760 --> 07:47.340]  I put my fingers into the bottom of the root zone
[07:47.340 --> 07:49.100]  and just spread it out a little bit
[07:49.100 --> 07:50.740]  so that it looks like you just blew the bottom
[07:50.740 --> 07:51.740]  of that plant right up.
[07:51.740 --> 07:53.420]  And people are like, well, you just fucked up your roots.
[07:53.420 --> 07:54.820]  Yes, I did.
[07:54.820 --> 07:56.780]  And when I pot it into the next pot,
[07:56.780 --> 07:58.940]  that fucked up root section is gonna be
[07:58.940 --> 08:01.700]  the most explosive root section in that whole pot.
[08:01.700 --> 08:03.980]  That part's gonna go, oh, he gave us a little opening
[08:03.980 --> 08:05.360]  because right now the roots are kind of tight.
[08:05.360 --> 08:07.220]  They're wrapped around inside that cup.
[08:07.220 --> 08:08.900]  I reached in there and pulled them apart a little bit
[08:08.900 --> 08:09.940]  and gave them a little space.
[08:09.940 --> 08:11.780]  And that space is where the roots are gonna go.
[08:11.780 --> 08:13.640]  Let's grow and they're gonna take off.
[08:13.640 --> 08:14.560]  They're gonna explode.
[08:14.560 --> 08:17.920]  So I let them get a little bit tight in their early pot.
[08:17.920 --> 08:18.760]  They want new shoes.
[08:18.760 --> 08:21.280]  They're begging for new kicks before I put them in there.
[08:21.280 --> 08:23.520]  As soon as they get their new kicks, they take off running.
[08:23.520 --> 08:25.660]  Remember when you gave a new little kid new shoes
[08:25.660 --> 08:27.360]  or when you gave a little kid new shoes,
[08:27.360 --> 08:28.460]  he thought he could run faster.
[08:28.460 --> 08:31.380]  The plants are gonna do the same damn thing.
[08:31.380 --> 08:33.920]  So you have less chance for overwatering.
[08:33.920 --> 08:35.440]  They dry down more quickly.
[08:35.440 --> 08:37.000]  You get to water them more frequently.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.880]  If you get a quicker dry and wet time,
[08:39.880 --> 08:41.400]  more feeding, more watering time.
[08:42.220 --> 08:44.300]  Commercial grower, I like that.
[08:44.300 --> 08:45.220]  I let them get tight.
[08:45.220 --> 08:46.400]  That way when you up pot them,
[08:46.400 --> 08:48.040]  they do go a little bit more quickly.
[08:48.040 --> 08:49.380]  They take off.
[08:49.380 --> 08:50.980]  Then here's another great thing.
[08:52.140 --> 08:54.980]  In my grow space, in a commercial environment
[08:54.980 --> 08:59.380]  or in most places where we aren't super limited by numbers,
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.540]  space is valuable.
[09:01.540 --> 09:05.260]  And if I've got a little tiny plant that is six inches tall
[09:05.260 --> 09:07.260]  in a seven gallon pot,
[09:07.260 --> 09:10.340]  which I'm gonna guess is about 18 inches in diameter,
[09:10.360 --> 09:13.760]  I am wasting a lot of space.
[09:13.760 --> 09:16.720]  I can put those plants into smaller pots
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.620]  and I can push them together much closer,
[09:19.620 --> 09:20.800]  which does a couple of things.
[09:20.800 --> 09:21.960]  I bought a lot more space,
[09:21.960 --> 09:24.440]  which means I've got room for a lot more plants.
[09:25.320 --> 09:27.000]  Keep in mind, those are gonna get up potted
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.120]  into bigger pots later
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.600]  and you'll have to put them into the flower room
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.800]  and they will take up more space.
[09:30.800 --> 09:32.040]  But if you're dividing rooms
[09:32.040 --> 09:33.260]  and they're going multiple places,
[09:33.260 --> 09:35.100]  you need more room for more pots.
[09:35.100 --> 09:37.840]  Smaller pots while you can is not a bad idea.
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.300]  Then if you're taking up less floor space with plants,
[09:43.300 --> 09:46.500]  that means we can probably turn off a couple of lights.
[09:46.500 --> 09:48.700]  If those plants are able to be moved over
[09:48.700 --> 09:49.720]  to one side of the room
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.820]  and they all fit underneath two or three lights,
[09:51.820 --> 09:54.300]  instead of running all six or eight lights in that room,
[09:54.300 --> 09:56.500]  you can save yourself that much electricity.
[09:56.500 --> 09:59.260]  The lights are on for at least 18 hours a day
[09:59.260 --> 10:00.100]  in this environment,
[10:00.100 --> 10:01.340]  because we got small veg plants,
[10:01.340 --> 10:03.800]  we want them on 18, six or more.
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.520]  Running one or two lights at that rate
[10:05.520 --> 10:07.020]  is going to cost a little bit of money.
[10:07.080 --> 10:09.000]  I don't care if you're a commercial environment,
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.840]  a home grow, that will add up quite quickly.
[10:11.840 --> 10:13.140]  Because along with that light,
[10:13.140 --> 10:14.160]  every light that's running,
[10:14.160 --> 10:16.680]  you've got a little bit of air conditioning going,
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.160]  you probably got a fan going,
[10:18.160 --> 10:19.480]  there's a dehumidifier.
[10:19.480 --> 10:21.480]  Every light adds more equipment.
[10:21.480 --> 10:23.080]  Don't just think that you're paying for that light
[10:23.080 --> 10:24.260]  when the light runs,
[10:24.260 --> 10:26.040]  because there's a fan going with that light.
[10:26.040 --> 10:28.040]  There's something that goes along with it
[10:28.040 --> 10:29.960]  to keep it cool, keep it comfortable.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.800]  The light creates heat,
[10:30.800 --> 10:31.960]  we gotta move the heat,
[10:31.960 --> 10:33.560]  then we move the heat, we create humidity,
[10:33.560 --> 10:35.000]  you gotta get rid of the humidity.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.720]  So many things happen because of that light.
[10:37.300 --> 10:39.460]  Don't just consider the cost of the light.
[10:39.460 --> 10:41.180]  You're saving a lot of other things
[10:41.180 --> 10:42.660]  when you turn off that light.
[10:42.660 --> 10:45.500]  So move those big seven gallon pots,
[10:45.500 --> 10:47.420]  they're like 18 inches around, I think.
[10:47.420 --> 10:48.560]  I'm guessing, I'm a drummer,
[10:48.560 --> 10:49.620]  I guess they're about 18 inches.
[10:49.620 --> 10:52.300]  I'm looking at an 18 inch floor tom next to me.
[10:52.300 --> 10:54.420]  Probably about 16, 18 inches around.
[10:54.420 --> 10:57.300]  A three gallon pot, I think, is about 12 inches around.
[10:57.300 --> 10:58.460]  When you look at that in a grow room,
[10:58.460 --> 11:02.580]  you can fit three to four three gallon pots
[11:02.580 --> 11:06.180]  in the space of two seven gallon pots if you do it right.
[11:06.200 --> 11:07.960]  Save you a lot of room, move them closer together.
[11:07.960 --> 11:09.120]  If you're doing one gallon pots,
[11:09.120 --> 11:10.840]  you can get a bunch in there.
[11:10.840 --> 11:12.680]  Don't cram the plants in so tight
[11:12.680 --> 11:14.240]  that they're pushing on each other.
[11:14.240 --> 11:15.080]  Give them space.
[11:15.080 --> 11:17.220]  But I'm saying, don't waste a bunch of space
[11:17.220 --> 11:18.200]  in your grow environment.
[11:18.200 --> 11:21.420]  That's why I would start with smaller pots.
[11:21.420 --> 11:25.200]  Start off in a cup or a one gallon pot or a net pot.
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.840]  And then as soon as it starts to get tight in there
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.640]  and that plant's getting a little bit bigger,
[11:28.640 --> 11:30.160]  that's when I put it into my next pot.
[11:30.160 --> 11:32.840]  Now it has gone officially in my labeling system
[11:32.840 --> 11:36.660]  from small veg to its vegitative stage.
[11:36.660 --> 11:38.340]  Now it's actually in veg, it's vegging.
[11:38.340 --> 11:40.440]  It's not small veg, it's veg.
[11:40.440 --> 11:41.560]  And then the next stage is like,
[11:41.560 --> 11:42.900]  we're about to flower these bitches.
[11:42.900 --> 11:44.640]  That's when they get lollipopped and cleaned up
[11:44.640 --> 11:45.800]  and start getting really worked.
[11:45.800 --> 11:48.780]  But yeah, transplant them.
[11:48.780 --> 11:50.400]  That way you can save yourself space,
[11:50.400 --> 11:53.300]  save nutrients, save water, save soil.
[11:53.300 --> 11:56.060]  You can save lighting by pushing the plants closer together.
[11:56.060 --> 11:57.900]  By saving lighting, you're saving electricity.
[11:57.900 --> 12:02.040]  By saving electricity, you are saving a lot of money.
[12:02.060 --> 12:03.060]  I think I covered that one.
[12:03.060 --> 12:05.940]  That was a pretty good ramble on for what was meant to be
[12:05.940 --> 12:07.740]  just a really quick topic there.
[12:07.740 --> 12:09.100]  So yeah, graduated pot size.
[12:09.100 --> 12:11.140]  I do encourage you to work your way up
[12:11.140 --> 12:13.140]  from a smaller pot to a bigger pot
[12:13.140 --> 12:14.940]  to your final destination pot,
[12:14.940 --> 12:17.220]  which you do choose to flower in.
[12:17.220 --> 12:19.000]  You don't want the plants to get root bound.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.420]  If they do get root bound, some plants may panic on you.
[12:21.420 --> 12:23.740]  They may start to flower, they'll stop feeding.
[12:23.740 --> 12:24.780]  They'll look really pissed off.
[12:24.780 --> 12:25.600]  It'll be confusing.
[12:25.600 --> 12:27.300]  You're like, why are these plants doing this weird shit?
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.340]  They're root bound.
[12:28.340 --> 12:30.180]  They wanna go into a bigger pot.
[12:30.200 --> 12:32.840]  When you up pot, every time I up pot,
[12:32.840 --> 12:35.840]  I like to sprinkle a little bit of microbe product
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.640]  either around the roots of the plant that I'm potting
[12:38.640 --> 12:41.280]  or into the hole in which it is getting potted.
[12:41.280 --> 12:45.600]  So I pull that plant out of the pot, the container.
[12:45.600 --> 12:48.560]  I can see my white roots on the outside of that dirt,
[12:48.560 --> 12:50.520]  just holding all that dirt together.
[12:50.520 --> 12:53.760]  I'll get a root product or a microbe product
[12:53.760 --> 12:55.040]  and just dust the outside of it.
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.000]  Just sprinkle it.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.200]  I'll turn that pot with my hand, just spin it,
[12:58.200 --> 12:59.280]  and I'll just use a little cup
[12:59.300 --> 13:01.220]  and just sprinkle some of the microbes on there.
[13:01.220 --> 13:02.220]  And then when I pot it on there,
[13:02.220 --> 13:04.760]  there are already microbes on that root zone
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.740]  telling those roots, hey bro, go crazy.
[13:06.740 --> 13:08.620]  Life is gonna be good in here.
[13:08.620 --> 13:09.860]  As soon as you put some water on it,
[13:09.860 --> 13:11.260]  all that shit activates.
[13:11.260 --> 13:12.300]  It goes crazy.
[13:12.300 --> 13:15.940]  Those plants go shabang, kapow.
[13:15.940 --> 13:17.760]  All right, I think I talked long enough about that part.
[13:17.760 --> 13:20.260]  Let me read an email that I've got here in front of me
[13:20.260 --> 13:24.600]  or this podcast is going to get out of control long.
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.020]  Big shout out to all my friends at the grocery store.
[13:26.020 --> 13:27.460]  It's a good time hanging out at the grocery store.
[13:27.480 --> 13:29.440]  I apologize for if I seemed rude
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.280]  because I was in a hurry today.
[13:31.280 --> 13:33.800]  I was simply in a fucking hurry today.
[13:33.800 --> 13:34.640]  I was trying to get a lot done
[13:34.640 --> 13:35.600]  and they didn't have what I needed.
[13:35.600 --> 13:38.160]  So that meant I had to go to more stores.
[13:38.160 --> 13:39.800]  I wasn't trying to be rude.
[13:39.800 --> 13:40.840]  I had shit to do.
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.520]  All right, this one is not the one I'm looking for.
[13:43.520 --> 13:45.440]  Is this the message I need?
[13:45.440 --> 13:46.280]  Here we go.
[13:46.280 --> 13:48.100]  This is the message I need right here.
[13:49.800 --> 13:50.920]  Excuse me for clearing the throat.
[13:50.920 --> 13:52.840]  This one says, hey, Ross to Jeff,
[13:52.840 --> 13:55.520]  before my question, I just wanted to shout you out
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.700]  and thank you for all you do for the grow community.
[13:58.700 --> 14:00.600]  I love the show because other podcasts
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.820]  don't stay informational and they can be hard to consume
[14:03.820 --> 14:05.540]  and they're time consuming
[14:05.540 --> 14:07.540]  and it's hard learning this process.
[14:07.540 --> 14:09.020]  I love the straightforward info
[14:09.020 --> 14:10.620]  and down to business approach.
[14:10.620 --> 14:12.500]  So thank you.
[14:12.500 --> 14:16.180]  That's a great compliment that I try to stay on subject.
[14:16.180 --> 14:17.600]  I try to stay on point.
[14:17.600 --> 14:20.660]  I do got the ADD and I also try to have fun,
[14:20.660 --> 14:21.980]  but I also try to include you
[14:21.980 --> 14:23.220]  and make you feel like you're hanging out.
[14:23.220 --> 14:24.700]  I can almost pass you the joint.
[14:25.200 --> 14:26.140]  If I had a joint right here,
[14:26.140 --> 14:28.320]  I could almost want you to feel like you're right there.
[14:28.320 --> 14:29.960]  You can almost smell the smoke.
[14:29.960 --> 14:30.940]  Once you're hanging out with me.
[14:30.940 --> 14:33.160]  So I'm glad you feel like you're learning from me
[14:33.160 --> 14:35.320]  and I'm glad you feel like I stay on point.
[14:37.560 --> 14:39.060]  I stay informational.
[14:39.060 --> 14:40.560]  I used to talk about the comedy shows
[14:40.560 --> 14:41.520]  I used to go to and shit.
[14:41.520 --> 14:42.720]  Sometimes I talk about what I do,
[14:42.720 --> 14:44.500]  but I try to talk about just growing
[14:44.500 --> 14:47.480]  and not talk too much about myself on the show now.
[14:47.480 --> 14:49.020]  But I do want you to feel like you're hanging out
[14:49.020 --> 14:50.800]  because we are friends.
[14:50.800 --> 14:51.680]  Let me get to the point here.
[14:51.680 --> 14:53.760]  It says my question and thank you for the compliments, dude.
[14:53.780 --> 14:54.980]  It says my question.
[14:54.980 --> 14:57.360]  I'm running a nine by seven tent
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.580]  with two 1000 watt Mars Hydro TS lights,
[15:01.580 --> 15:02.420]  carbon filter.
[15:02.420 --> 15:03.420]  We got some details in here.
[15:03.420 --> 15:05.340]  I'm growing a three, five and seven gallon pots.
[15:05.340 --> 15:08.540]  Normally only running three to five pots at a time.
[15:08.540 --> 15:11.220]  I only use Fox Farm Ocean Forest
[15:11.220 --> 15:13.860]  and I always grow 100% organically.
[15:13.860 --> 15:17.180]  I'm using down to earth dry fertilizers and bat guano.
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.660]  I also add fish shit every feed as well.
[15:19.660 --> 15:22.420]  So we got the down to earth dry ferts,
[15:22.420 --> 15:27.320]  bone meal, bat guano and fish shit every feed.
[15:27.320 --> 15:29.960]  Each of my first five grows has taught me new things
[15:29.960 --> 15:33.320]  and how to solve different problems the grow might have.
[15:33.320 --> 15:35.120]  That's a great thing to notice
[15:35.120 --> 15:36.800]  that every grow you've solved a problem
[15:36.800 --> 15:38.360]  and gotten a little bit better.
[15:39.600 --> 15:41.520]  None of your grows are gonna be problem free.
[15:41.520 --> 15:43.400]  Every grow is gonna have some sort of obstacle
[15:43.400 --> 15:44.940]  or hurdle and issue to deal with.
[15:44.940 --> 15:46.640]  It's learning to deal with those obstacles
[15:46.640 --> 15:49.060]  and eliminate them and not go into panic mode.
[15:49.060 --> 15:51.000]  I've seen growers, I've done it myself.
[15:51.020 --> 15:53.700]  You see an issue and you go, oh shit, there's a problem.
[15:53.700 --> 15:55.240]  All the alarms go off in your head.
[15:55.240 --> 15:56.460]  You fucking pull the rip cord.
[15:56.460 --> 15:58.900]  You gotta do all this dumb shit to solve the problem.
[15:58.900 --> 16:01.860]  When really all you needed to do was go take a dab
[16:01.860 --> 16:04.140]  or go smoke a fucking joint and really think clearly
[16:04.140 --> 16:05.380]  about how to fix it and you'd went,
[16:05.380 --> 16:06.540]  oh, you know what, it's a dumb problem.
[16:06.540 --> 16:07.940]  I can solve this overnight.
[16:07.940 --> 16:09.420]  You don't get panic mode so quickly
[16:09.420 --> 16:11.420]  because you realize that these plants are fixable.
[16:11.420 --> 16:12.820]  Problems are solvable.
[16:12.820 --> 16:14.700]  So as long as you're learning something with every grow,
[16:14.700 --> 16:16.380]  you're making great progress.
[16:16.380 --> 16:18.460]  Let me find my spot here.
[16:18.460 --> 16:20.580]  There we are, my spot in this message says,
[16:20.680 --> 16:23.080]  but I seem to be lacking in the nutrient knowledge
[16:23.080 --> 16:26.920]  and the dry and cure stage because before harvest,
[16:26.920 --> 16:31.120]  the plants smell amazing and have a nice dense consistency.
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.280]  But after dry and cure, the buds are airy and light
[16:34.280 --> 16:36.460]  and have no density.
[16:36.460 --> 16:38.160]  There are a few things that can be causing that.
[16:38.160 --> 16:39.720]  I wrote that down.
[16:39.720 --> 16:42.160]  Could be a lot of stuff adding up to cause that.
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.680]  It goes on to say, I have yet to have my products smell
[16:47.680 --> 16:49.480]  or taste even close to what it's like
[16:49.500 --> 16:50.780]  before I chop them down.
[16:50.780 --> 16:52.940]  I have a couple ideas why that's happening as well.
[16:52.940 --> 16:55.020]  I've listened to your dry and cure episode
[16:55.020 --> 16:56.500]  and other reliable sources,
[16:56.500 --> 16:59.540]  but I seem to not be able to translate that knowledge
[16:59.540 --> 17:02.160]  I soak up into physically and visually understanding
[17:02.160 --> 17:03.420]  this process.
[17:03.420 --> 17:06.020]  I have a hygrometer in the dry and cure area,
[17:06.020 --> 17:08.380]  but unfortunately I'm not able to keep that area
[17:08.380 --> 17:09.300]  a hundred percent dark.
[17:09.300 --> 17:11.580]  That dark isn't a hundred percent crucial,
[17:11.580 --> 17:14.480]  but I do keep the humidity under 50%.
[17:14.480 --> 17:17.620]  Let's try to get that to about 50 or 60%
[17:17.620 --> 17:20.400]  and make your product take just a little bit longer
[17:20.400 --> 17:22.120]  to dry may help you out.
[17:22.120 --> 17:24.320]  What could be the main reason for my airy buds
[17:24.320 --> 17:25.780]  and loss of aroma?
[17:25.780 --> 17:27.780]  Thanks again, Ross DeJeff, for all the information
[17:27.780 --> 17:29.680]  and time you have given.
[17:29.680 --> 17:32.960]  You give every day to home growers learning.
[17:32.960 --> 17:34.840]  One love from, and then I'm not sure
[17:34.840 --> 17:35.680]  if they want their name said,
[17:35.680 --> 17:36.840]  we're just gonna call them Kyle today.
[17:36.840 --> 17:37.720]  Big shout out to Kyle.
[17:37.720 --> 17:39.400]  Thank you for the great message, bro.
[17:39.400 --> 17:40.880]  I do have some answers here.
[17:40.880 --> 17:43.180]  I think I can help you out a little bit.
[17:45.080 --> 17:46.320]  Let me start with the disclaimer
[17:46.340 --> 17:47.980]  because I like to do this.
[17:47.980 --> 17:50.780]  Organic growing is not my specialty.
[17:50.780 --> 17:54.300]  I straight up am a bottled nutrient grower.
[17:54.300 --> 17:56.300]  I grow with new millennium bottled nutrients.
[17:56.300 --> 17:58.860]  Sometimes I add some products from Vegbloom
[17:58.860 --> 18:01.300]  or Hydroponic Research is the company,
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.960]  but most of what I'm growing is non-organic.
[18:03.960 --> 18:05.780]  I'm a salt-based grower.
[18:05.780 --> 18:08.900]  I find it easier in a commercial environment
[18:08.900 --> 18:12.020]  to train a crew, to write a standard operating procedure,
[18:12.020 --> 18:15.480]  to have repeatable results by using bottled nutrients.
[18:15.500 --> 18:16.460]  I love the organics.
[18:16.460 --> 18:17.300]  I love the idea.
[18:17.300 --> 18:18.620]  I love the passion.
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.060]  I love the sustainability,
[18:20.060 --> 18:22.780]  but the way I know how to grow,
[18:22.780 --> 18:25.380]  the goal for my commercial facilities
[18:25.380 --> 18:26.900]  that I'm hired to help with,
[18:26.900 --> 18:29.360]  the goal that the owners have,
[18:29.360 --> 18:31.980]  I think that a bottled nutrient system
[18:31.980 --> 18:33.620]  is the way to go for my style.
[18:33.620 --> 18:35.420]  It's repeatable, it's sustainable.
[18:35.420 --> 18:36.720]  I know how to do it.
[18:36.720 --> 18:38.060]  The organics, I don't understand
[18:38.060 --> 18:40.420]  how to make it repeatable and sustainable.
[18:40.420 --> 18:44.060]  I don't understand how to make it trainable for a crew.
[18:44.080 --> 18:45.480]  I need to write down instructions
[18:45.480 --> 18:48.160]  that can be done by anybody when I'm gone.
[18:49.880 --> 18:53.200]  I think organics, there are a lot of variables
[18:53.200 --> 18:55.800]  that we would have to have some hands-on experience
[18:55.800 --> 18:58.400]  and some eyes to think about a little bit too much.
[18:58.400 --> 19:01.400]  With the bottled nutrients, I say 20 of this,
[19:01.400 --> 19:02.640]  50 of this, 20 of that,
[19:02.640 --> 19:05.360]  and every time we feed it, it is the same thing.
[19:05.360 --> 19:07.840]  With organics, you can get some variables in there.
[19:07.840 --> 19:10.360]  This is my thought process on the whole thing.
[19:10.360 --> 19:12.720]  So I'm not an organic grower.
[19:12.720 --> 19:15.300]  That part is not my area of expertise.
[19:15.300 --> 19:18.780]  So when it comes to your nutrient knowledge lacking,
[19:18.780 --> 19:22.600]  I as well am lacking nutrients knowledge in this department
[19:22.600 --> 19:24.080]  because I don't do the organic stuff.
[19:24.080 --> 19:26.340]  I understand the nutrients, I understand the elements,
[19:26.340 --> 19:28.460]  I understand the way the plants feed,
[19:28.460 --> 19:30.740]  but I'm doing it a little bit differently than you are.
[19:30.740 --> 19:32.480]  So I may not have all of the answers
[19:32.480 --> 19:34.580]  when it comes to the nutrient part.
[19:34.580 --> 19:39.580]  But also, I'm not sure if that is enough light in this room.
[19:39.780 --> 19:41.900]  I'm not sure of the spread of that light.
[19:41.920 --> 19:42.880]  It could be enough light,
[19:42.880 --> 19:45.320]  but what I'm learning about LEDs is they don't spread a lot.
[19:45.320 --> 19:46.960]  We need more spread on these LEDs.
[19:46.960 --> 19:48.200]  I'm not complaining.
[19:48.200 --> 19:49.400]  I'm just saying that's what I'm learning.
[19:49.400 --> 19:52.200]  So I'm wondering if you've got like one section
[19:52.200 --> 19:53.800]  with a lot of light and then the rest of the room
[19:53.800 --> 19:56.360]  isn't getting a lot of light because that'll help.
[19:56.360 --> 19:58.400]  More light spread around, more proper light
[19:58.400 --> 19:59.800]  would help with intensity,
[19:59.800 --> 20:02.040]  would help with bud density is what I'm getting at.
[20:02.040 --> 20:04.400]  So one thing I would recommend to start with,
[20:04.400 --> 20:05.720]  and I don't know that this is doing it.
[20:05.720 --> 20:09.240]  I am guessing and assuming based on the information I've got,
[20:09.240 --> 20:11.240]  I'm trying to give useful information.
[20:11.260 --> 20:12.580]  Are you trellising?
[20:12.580 --> 20:14.880]  Are you using a net to hold down the main tops?
[20:14.880 --> 20:16.860]  If you've got one top that's sticking up,
[20:16.860 --> 20:18.400]  that light is hitting this one.
[20:18.400 --> 20:19.940]  We've talked about this before.
[20:19.940 --> 20:21.320]  That bud's getting really hot,
[20:21.320 --> 20:22.660]  but the rest of the plants down here
[20:22.660 --> 20:24.720]  aren't getting the intense light that they could.
[20:24.720 --> 20:27.120]  Trellis this one down, then the light will hit
[20:27.120 --> 20:28.700]  all of the buds and all of the buds
[20:28.700 --> 20:30.220]  will have a chance to be more dense.
[20:30.220 --> 20:33.360]  You won't have tops that are real nice, real tight,
[20:33.360 --> 20:35.020]  kind of good, and then bottoms that are shitty.
[20:35.020 --> 20:37.980]  Or you'll have a bunch of decent buds at the top.
[20:37.980 --> 20:39.580]  Maybe they'll tighten up for you if you do that.
[20:39.580 --> 20:41.680]  That's just one idea.
[20:41.680 --> 20:43.780]  I was looking at your nutrients a little bit.
[20:43.780 --> 20:47.440]  Maybe a kelp product in there would help you out.
[20:47.440 --> 20:49.200]  I don't know when you're feeding what,
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.000]  but I know that kelp products do help
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.540]  with stank and density, in my opinion.
[20:53.540 --> 20:56.440]  In my experience, a kelp product would help you out.
[20:56.440 --> 20:59.960]  There are plenty of organic kelp products
[20:59.960 --> 21:02.320]  which you can mix into your soil to begin with,
[21:02.320 --> 21:04.560]  or you can find a liquid kelp product
[21:04.560 --> 21:06.200]  which you can feed in later,
[21:06.200 --> 21:09.440]  or you can find a kelp product that you can foliar feed.
[21:10.260 --> 21:11.100]  You're trying to go organic,
[21:11.100 --> 21:12.460]  so you're going to have to do your research
[21:12.460 --> 21:15.460]  on those products, but that is a good start for those ideas.
[21:16.300 --> 21:21.300]  Airy buds, that's probably grow and cure related,
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.620]  but we're gonna say it starts in the grow.
[21:24.620 --> 21:27.900]  There are a lot of things that can be giving you airy buds.
[21:27.900 --> 21:29.640]  Have you tried multiple genetics?
[21:29.640 --> 21:31.860]  The genetics have a lot to do with that.
[21:31.860 --> 21:33.580]  If you're growing something
[21:33.580 --> 21:35.080]  that's from a tropical environment
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.420]  that's meant to be real airy,
[21:36.420 --> 21:37.340]  because it gets humid there
[21:37.340 --> 21:39.100]  and they need some airflow in those buds,
[21:39.920 --> 21:42.160]  that bud naturally just is not going to be real dense.
[21:42.160 --> 21:43.800]  If you're growing some OG Kush,
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.960]  some chem dog and it's not getting dense,
[21:45.960 --> 21:48.040]  that is a room or a feed issue.
[21:48.040 --> 21:50.140]  There's a problem there.
[21:50.140 --> 21:51.820]  So let's check the genetics.
[21:51.820 --> 21:52.940]  That's something I would check on.
[21:52.940 --> 21:54.120]  Then light.
[21:54.120 --> 21:55.800]  Is there enough light in that room?
[21:55.800 --> 21:59.380]  Honestly, I'm not familiar with the Mars Hydro light.
[21:59.380 --> 22:01.780]  I don't know if that's enough lighting.
[22:01.780 --> 22:03.440]  I don't know if that's enough wattage,
[22:03.440 --> 22:05.500]  and I don't know the spread on that light
[22:05.500 --> 22:07.120]  in that size of a room.
[22:07.120 --> 22:08.580]  I honestly don't know,
[22:09.020 --> 22:10.140]  but that's something we can check on,
[22:10.140 --> 22:11.640]  something we could investigate.
[22:11.640 --> 22:13.120]  That's one of the things on the list
[22:13.120 --> 22:15.560]  I would eliminate to see if that is the problem.
[22:15.560 --> 22:16.560]  Is there enough light?
[22:16.560 --> 22:17.400]  And like I mentioned,
[22:17.400 --> 22:19.400]  do you have that one bud right in the light?
[22:19.400 --> 22:20.240]  Is that bud good?
[22:20.240 --> 22:22.660]  Are you trellising it down to get the light everywhere?
[22:22.660 --> 22:24.440]  Are you defoliating to get that light
[22:24.440 --> 22:25.640]  further down into the canopy
[22:25.640 --> 22:26.880]  and get some light penetration?
[22:26.880 --> 22:28.920]  That may help you out as well.
[22:28.920 --> 22:31.920]  Something that does make fluffy buds,
[22:31.920 --> 22:34.760]  that will make the buds actually fluff out
[22:34.760 --> 22:37.520]  and become airy and be not as dense as they could,
[22:37.520 --> 22:40.980]  is environmental factors like too much heat.
[22:40.980 --> 22:43.100]  Think about in the summer.
[22:43.100 --> 22:45.420]  When it gets too hot, you don't want,
[22:45.420 --> 22:46.940]  even in the summer, you don't want your own
[22:46.940 --> 22:48.820]  hands resting on your legs.
[22:48.820 --> 22:49.860]  Your hands get all sweaty
[22:49.860 --> 22:51.740]  where your hands are resting on your legs.
[22:51.740 --> 22:53.220]  The plants are just like that.
[22:53.220 --> 22:55.860]  They're gonna go, hey, Calyx, stack it on top of me.
[22:55.860 --> 22:56.820]  I don't want you up there.
[22:56.820 --> 22:59.200]  And they're just gonna start spreading and getting fluffy.
[22:59.200 --> 23:00.460]  When it gets too hot,
[23:00.460 --> 23:02.140]  they're just trying to spread their legs
[23:02.140 --> 23:04.020]  so they're not getting hot between their legs.
[23:04.020 --> 23:05.180]  The plants are doing the same thing.
[23:05.180 --> 23:06.020]  Like, bro, it's too hot.
[23:06.020 --> 23:07.680]  I'm trying to spread out a little bit.
[23:07.680 --> 23:08.880]  Those plants are doing the same thing.
[23:08.880 --> 23:10.920]  It's too hot, it's too humid, it's too sticky.
[23:10.920 --> 23:12.360]  The plants feel funky.
[23:12.360 --> 23:14.160]  Instead of being dense, they're getting fluffy.
[23:14.160 --> 23:16.340]  Also, they know if they get too dense,
[23:16.340 --> 23:19.000]  all that moisture will build up inside of those buds.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.640]  And if it's too humid in there,
[23:20.640 --> 23:22.400]  all that moisture will create a problem.
[23:22.400 --> 23:25.760]  You'll get boitritis or powdery mildew inside of your buds.
[23:25.760 --> 23:29.320]  So, heat, moisture, things like that
[23:29.320 --> 23:30.600]  could be causing you problems.
[23:30.600 --> 23:33.200]  Also, a drastic diurnal swing.
[23:33.200 --> 23:35.840]  If you're getting too hot at night
[23:36.660 --> 23:38.020]  or too cold in the day or opposite
[23:38.020 --> 23:40.540]  or more than eight to 12 degrees change
[23:40.540 --> 23:41.660]  from day to night temperature,
[23:41.660 --> 23:44.860]  that can play a role in your fluffy buds.
[23:44.860 --> 23:46.120]  Another thing, the feeding.
[23:46.120 --> 23:47.300]  If you're not feeding properly,
[23:47.300 --> 23:49.340]  if they're not getting the food that they need
[23:49.340 --> 23:52.040]  and they're not getting the nutrients,
[23:52.040 --> 23:53.780]  just imagine if you didn't eat proper food,
[23:53.780 --> 23:56.240]  you wouldn't build up the way you needed to either.
[23:56.240 --> 23:57.720]  I'm a skinny dude.
[23:57.720 --> 23:59.940]  I eat a pretty good vegetarian diet.
[23:59.940 --> 24:01.540]  I look like a stick figure.
[24:01.540 --> 24:03.580]  Brock Lesnar is my height
[24:03.600 --> 24:06.120]  but about three times my width and density.
[24:06.120 --> 24:08.360]  He eats a totally different diet than me.
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.600]  He eats a high performance, fucking high protein,
[24:11.600 --> 24:14.280]  rip your head off, shit down your throat kind of diet.
[24:14.280 --> 24:17.240]  Your plants may be needing that Brock Lesnar diet.
[24:17.240 --> 24:19.520]  You may be giving them the Rasta Jeff
[24:19.520 --> 24:21.280]  pasta and carbohydrate diet.
[24:21.280 --> 24:23.560]  So, maybe it's diet.
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.600]  I read what you're giving them
[24:24.600 --> 24:27.080]  but I don't know exactly how much of that
[24:27.080 --> 24:29.760]  and I don't know exactly what's in all of those products.
[24:29.760 --> 24:31.240]  So, you may need to add a couple of things
[24:31.240 --> 24:32.080]  to boost that up.
[24:32.080 --> 24:34.620]  A kelp product, maybe a bloom booster.
[24:34.620 --> 24:36.940]  I don't know exactly, I made the disclaimer, dude.
[24:36.940 --> 24:38.780]  I don't know exactly what you're doing
[24:38.780 --> 24:40.380]  with these organic nutrients.
[24:40.380 --> 24:43.740]  I don't know what I'm doing with your organic nutrients.
[24:43.740 --> 24:46.000]  So, it could be a feed issue.
[24:46.000 --> 24:46.980]  I wrote down trellis.
[24:46.980 --> 24:50.140]  Make sure you get a more consistent canopy.
[24:50.140 --> 24:51.340]  I've talked about that.
[24:51.340 --> 24:52.980]  That even canopy will help you out.
[24:52.980 --> 24:55.140]  That way the light will get to all of the buds.
[24:55.140 --> 24:57.840]  You won't have some dense, some fluffy.
[24:57.840 --> 24:59.220]  We call the fluffy buds larvae.
[24:59.220 --> 25:01.420]  That stuff on the bottom, that's larvae crap.
[25:01.440 --> 25:02.640]  I usually pinch that off.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.600]  It doesn't even make it to the flower area.
[25:04.600 --> 25:05.800]  Nobody wants to trim that.
[25:05.800 --> 25:06.960]  That's junk.
[25:06.960 --> 25:07.840]  Pinch that shit off.
[25:07.840 --> 25:10.120]  If the light's not getting down there, get that off.
[25:10.120 --> 25:12.080]  Let's try to move some of the energy
[25:12.080 --> 25:14.880]  to the actual bud part of the plants.
[25:14.880 --> 25:17.740]  This should make the buds tighter, more dense.
[25:19.200 --> 25:23.100]  So, that is what I think could be happening during the grow
[25:23.100 --> 25:24.520]  that is making the aroma
[25:24.520 --> 25:26.880]  and the density lack in these plants.
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.700]  The second part is probably in the dry and cure process.
[25:31.700 --> 25:34.060]  Something is happening during the harvest time.
[25:35.420 --> 25:37.300]  Light degrades terpenes.
[25:37.300 --> 25:38.740]  Heat degrades terpenes.
[25:38.740 --> 25:41.020]  Are these plants getting too warm?
[25:41.020 --> 25:45.020]  Are you able to give them a period of dark and cool
[25:45.020 --> 25:48.740]  for 12 to 24 hours before you harvest them?
[25:48.740 --> 25:50.500]  That may, that'll give you some of the,
[25:50.500 --> 25:52.420]  overnight while the plants are sleeping
[25:52.420 --> 25:54.540]  in the dark and the cool, they will produce a,
[25:54.540 --> 25:56.160]  produce, that word came out really weird.
[25:56.180 --> 25:57.260]  I hope I get some comments on that.
[25:57.260 --> 26:00.120]  They will produce a bunch of terpenes, right?
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.820]  They'll produce terps all night long
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.100]  while they're sleeping in that cool, dark environment.
[26:05.100 --> 26:06.940]  When you start turning on lights and heat,
[26:06.940 --> 26:09.380]  those terps start getting, they start volatizing.
[26:09.380 --> 26:10.900]  They start getting degrading.
[26:10.900 --> 26:12.320]  They start getting destroyed.
[26:12.320 --> 26:14.180]  So, if you can get it cool and dark in there for a while,
[26:14.180 --> 26:16.200]  build up as many terps as possible.
[26:16.200 --> 26:17.720]  Give yourself a headstart.
[26:17.720 --> 26:20.800]  Keep it cool the whole time you're drying and trimming it.
[26:20.800 --> 26:22.940]  Try not to handle it too much.
[26:22.940 --> 26:25.460]  Try not to touch it too much during the trim process
[26:25.460 --> 26:27.300]  and the defoliation process.
[26:28.900 --> 26:30.560]  You might be drying too quickly.
[26:30.560 --> 26:33.380]  Maybe let's slow down the drying process a little bit,
[26:33.380 --> 26:34.920]  just a little tiny bit.
[26:34.920 --> 26:37.080]  You said you're keeping it about 50% humidity.
[26:37.080 --> 26:40.200]  Let's go about 60 and slow that drying cure time
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.560]  down just a little bit.
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.600]  I know that sounds crazy.
[26:42.600 --> 26:43.840]  You wanna smoke your product,
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.920]  but you want to smoke a better product.
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.000]  Is that dry and cure room cold enough?
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.940]  If it's colder, the buds will get tighter as they dry up.
[26:51.940 --> 26:54.480]  If it's not cold enough, they're not gonna do that.
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.360]  Is it too dry in there?
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.080]  Is it too hot in the dry and cure room?
[26:59.080 --> 27:00.880]  That's gonna fuck up your product.
[27:00.880 --> 27:02.160]  Is there wind in there?
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.960]  The wind could be blowing your buds just dry
[27:05.960 --> 27:07.160]  and drying them right off.
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.000]  It's just blowing the terps right out.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.480]  Think about when you ride a motorcycle
[27:10.480 --> 27:11.480]  or if you go out on the boat
[27:11.480 --> 27:13.040]  or if you hang out on the wind all day,
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.600]  your lips are all chapped,
[27:14.600 --> 27:16.680]  fucking your skin feels all dry.
[27:16.680 --> 27:18.080]  These plants, if they're in the wind,
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.340]  hanging and drying in the wind,
[27:19.340 --> 27:21.560]  or if there's too much airflow in the dry room,
[27:21.560 --> 27:22.620]  they're doing the same thing.
[27:22.620 --> 27:24.420]  All your terps, all your moisture,
[27:24.420 --> 27:26.420]  it just got sucked right out of the room.
[27:26.420 --> 27:27.280]  It's all in the room.
[27:27.280 --> 27:29.280]  That's why your herb smells like hay.
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.340]  So I really think that slowing down the drying
[27:33.340 --> 27:35.060]  and curing process could help you out.
[27:35.060 --> 27:37.240]  Just go a little bit slower.
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.020]  And if you're not getting like an ammonia,
[27:43.080 --> 27:45.480]  an acrid pissy kind of aroma,
[27:45.480 --> 27:48.040]  you're not trapping too much moisture in there
[27:48.040 --> 27:50.280]  and you're not sealing it up too early.
[27:50.280 --> 27:52.400]  So I don't think that you're not ruining it.
[27:52.420 --> 27:54.880]  You're not getting the opportunity to ruin it.
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.480]  I think it may just be drying too quickly for you.
[27:58.480 --> 27:59.840]  So I would check all of the things
[27:59.840 --> 28:01.720]  we talked about in the grow.
[28:01.720 --> 28:02.900]  Is there proper lighting?
[28:02.900 --> 28:04.660]  Are you taking care of the genetics,
[28:04.660 --> 28:07.420]  the trellising, the heat, the feed, humidity?
[28:07.420 --> 28:10.200]  Is the lights, air, water, soil, the laws?
[28:10.200 --> 28:12.000]  That's laws, L-A-W-S.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.120]  You guys, have you thought about that?
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.640]  If I taught you that, I think I learned it from Subcool.
[28:15.640 --> 28:16.660]  I wanna give somebody credit
[28:16.660 --> 28:19.120]  because I think it's polite and important
[28:19.120 --> 28:20.880]  for a teacher to give credit where you learned shit.
[28:20.880 --> 28:21.700]  I didn't learn everything.
[28:22.540 --> 28:23.380]  I didn't make it all up.
[28:23.380 --> 28:25.740]  I think I learned laws, lights, air, water, and soil.
[28:25.740 --> 28:27.580]  I think I learned that from Subcool.
[28:27.580 --> 28:29.580]  Are you following all of the laws?
[28:29.580 --> 28:31.100]  If all the laws are in line,
[28:31.100 --> 28:32.860]  then let's check out the dry and cure tech.
[28:32.860 --> 28:35.040]  We may need to just slow it down a little bit,
[28:35.040 --> 28:36.060]  increase the humidity,
[28:36.060 --> 28:38.060]  lower the temperature may help you out.
[28:38.060 --> 28:39.900]  Just get it slowed down just a little bit.
[28:39.900 --> 28:42.100]  My last note on this subject
[28:42.100 --> 28:45.060]  is where are you drying and curing this product?
[28:45.060 --> 28:46.580]  Are you doing it in the basement?
[28:46.580 --> 28:48.340]  Are you doing it under the grow lights?
[28:48.340 --> 28:50.060]  Where is this happening?
[28:50.060 --> 28:52.460]  If you dry and cure your product
[28:52.460 --> 28:54.100]  in a funky scented basement,
[28:54.100 --> 28:58.580]  your product will get funky basement turps to it.
[28:58.580 --> 28:59.860]  If you're drying it in the bathroom,
[28:59.860 --> 29:01.860]  it's gonna pick up bathroom turps.
[29:01.860 --> 29:04.220]  So that may be something that's going on.
[29:04.220 --> 29:06.820]  So for tighter, more dense, more aroma,
[29:06.820 --> 29:09.780]  I'm really thinking it's gonna be a slower dry and cure
[29:09.780 --> 29:11.260]  at a lower temperature.
[29:11.260 --> 29:12.580]  That's gonna help you out.
[29:13.620 --> 29:15.380]  Maybe send me some pictures of the plants
[29:15.380 --> 29:16.860]  right before you cut them.
[29:16.860 --> 29:19.020]  Send me some pictures of your harvest process.
[29:19.020 --> 29:21.700]  Let me know how you're harvesting, drying and curing.
[29:21.700 --> 29:24.500]  And maybe I can give you some more advice, more guidance.
[29:24.500 --> 29:27.940]  Maybe we can give the listeners a little bit of a follow up.
[29:27.940 --> 29:29.580]  All right, Kyle, I hope I answered your question.
[29:29.580 --> 29:31.760]  I hope I gave you some useful info.
[29:31.760 --> 29:34.260]  Again, I'm not an expert in the organics,
[29:34.260 --> 29:36.060]  so I wasn't exactly sure where to start,
[29:36.060 --> 29:39.260]  but I feel like we got you a little bit,
[29:39.260 --> 29:41.100]  a little bit of info to get you moving,
[29:41.100 --> 29:43.780]  some stuff to check on, some adjustments to make.
[29:43.780 --> 29:45.580]  I do look forward to the update.
[29:45.580 --> 29:47.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[29:47.780 --> 29:49.300]  friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[29:49.300 --> 29:51.100]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[29:51.100 --> 29:52.500]  thank you for listening to this episode.
[29:52.500 --> 29:54.980]  If anybody out there has any grow questions,
[29:54.980 --> 29:57.520]  I would love to answer those questions on the show for you.
[29:57.520 --> 30:01.060]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[30:01.060 --> 30:02.360]  Also, I've got a website.
[30:02.360 --> 30:05.140]  My website is ieregenetics.com.
[30:05.140 --> 30:08.420]  On that website, there is a tab that says grow help.
[30:08.420 --> 30:10.040]  If you click on that grow help tab,
[30:10.040 --> 30:12.020]  you'll be taken to a little questionnaire.
[30:12.020 --> 30:14.460]  We ask you nine or 10 questions.
[30:14.460 --> 30:15.640]  They're very basic question.
[30:15.640 --> 30:17.340]  What kind of lights are you using?
[30:17.340 --> 30:18.540]  What strain are you growing?
[30:18.540 --> 30:20.380]  Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[30:20.380 --> 30:23.420]  Just the basic shit that will help me answer your questions.
[30:23.420 --> 30:25.460]  That way I get some details about your grow.
[30:25.460 --> 30:27.940]  I can build a, I can paint an image of your grow in my head.
[30:27.940 --> 30:29.960]  That way when it comes time to answer the question,
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.500]  all the details I need are right there.
[30:31.500 --> 30:33.260]  So if you hit that grow help tab,
[30:33.260 --> 30:34.780]  answer a few questions at the bottom,
[30:34.780 --> 30:36.580]  it says explain your problem.
[30:36.580 --> 30:38.980]  Simply tell me what the fuck is wrong with your plant
[30:38.980 --> 30:39.980]  and I will read it.
[30:39.980 --> 30:41.620]  I'll do my best to answer your question
[30:41.620 --> 30:43.780]  thoroughly here on the podcast.
[30:43.780 --> 30:46.860]  I do appreciate all of the listener interaction.
[30:47.380 --> 30:48.300]  This lets me know that I'm helping somebody.
[30:48.300 --> 30:50.140]  I know that we at least helped Kyle today.
[30:50.140 --> 30:51.020]  And if we're helping Kyle,
[30:51.020 --> 30:52.780]  there's probably somebody else out there
[30:52.780 --> 30:54.780]  with the same question, the same problem,
[30:54.780 --> 30:55.700]  just a numbers game.
[30:55.700 --> 30:56.680]  If one person asks,
[30:56.680 --> 30:58.860]  there's probably a lot of people out there
[30:58.860 --> 31:00.300]  that I can help with the same question.
[31:00.300 --> 31:03.700]  So I do appreciate the listener generated content.
[31:03.700 --> 31:05.640]  Thank you and thank you for listening.
[31:05.640 --> 31:07.500]  If you feel like this episode was educational,
[31:07.500 --> 31:09.020]  informative or entertaining,
[31:09.020 --> 31:10.620]  maybe you'd just like to throw me a couple of bucks
[31:10.620 --> 31:12.940]  because I made you giggle or taught you a couple of things.
[31:12.940 --> 31:17.420]  All you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[31:17.420 --> 31:19.380]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[31:19.380 --> 31:21.740]  All of the information you need to support the podcast
[31:21.740 --> 31:23.220]  is right there on the screen.
[31:23.220 --> 31:26.500]  Once again, big thank you and big up to everybody
[31:26.500 --> 31:28.780]  who has continued to support the podcast.
[31:28.780 --> 31:30.900]  I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[31:30.900 --> 31:33.720]  I think I'm just running out of camera time as well.
[31:33.720 --> 31:36.580]  So it is a good time to wrap up this podcast.
[31:36.580 --> 31:37.700]  Thanks for listening.
[31:37.700 --> 31:39.460]  I'll be back in just a couple of days.
[31:39.460 --> 31:42.140]  I wanna give a big shout out to my buddy Dave's not here.
[31:42.140 --> 31:44.580]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[31:44.580 --> 31:46.180]  and give your mom a hug for me.
