[02:17.450 --> 02:18.450]  All right.
[02:18.450 --> 02:20.650]  I don't want to ramble too much here at the top of the podcast.
[02:20.650 --> 02:23.750]  I do want to talk about selecting male plants for breeding.
[02:23.750 --> 02:28.030]  We may also touch a little bit about on selecting plants for reversals, which is when I take
[02:28.030 --> 02:31.970]  a female plant, treat it with a solution that does make it make pollen.
[02:31.970 --> 02:34.650]  That pollen of course only makes female seeds.
[02:34.650 --> 02:38.170]  We may touch a little bit about on how I select a plant for that.
[02:38.170 --> 02:39.670]  Let's jump right into it.
[02:39.670 --> 02:43.090]  How do I select plants for breeding?
[02:43.090 --> 02:44.370]  Let's talk about breeding.
[02:44.370 --> 02:48.490]  One thing I'm going to say a lot here is have a goal when it comes to breeding.
[02:48.490 --> 02:52.010]  If you don't have a goal when it comes to breeding, you're just pollen chucking.
[02:52.010 --> 02:55.530]  You wouldn't go into the kitchen without some sort of goal and just pour a bunch of shit
[02:55.530 --> 02:58.410]  in a bowl and mix it up and hope that it tastes good.
[02:58.410 --> 03:01.290]  It's kind of the same thing if you just put plants in a room and just throw plants in
[03:01.290 --> 03:02.730]  there and let them do the thing.
[03:02.730 --> 03:04.930]  You have no goal, no idea, no path.
[03:04.930 --> 03:05.930]  That's just pollen chucking.
[03:05.930 --> 03:07.210]  You're doing the same thing with the plants.
[03:07.210 --> 03:09.610]  You may make some good shit, but also who knows?
[03:09.610 --> 03:11.050]  You may not make some good shit.
[03:11.050 --> 03:12.090]  Put some thought into it.
[03:12.090 --> 03:15.050]  Have a strategy, have a plan, have a goal.
[03:15.050 --> 03:16.670]  Write down that goal.
[03:16.670 --> 03:19.910]  If you don't have a clear target, how do you know if you're hitting that target?
[03:19.910 --> 03:23.130]  If I'm saying I want to hit that dot right there on the wall with the ball and I throw
[03:23.130 --> 03:24.830]  the ball, I know I hit it.
[03:24.830 --> 03:28.810]  If I throw the ball and it goes way over there, I know I need to adjust and come this way.
[03:28.810 --> 03:30.150]  Then I can hit my goal.
[03:30.150 --> 03:32.130]  Do the same thing with your breeding project.
[03:32.130 --> 03:36.610]  Write down a goal, write down a target, see how close you get, be real with yourself,
[03:36.610 --> 03:38.370]  and then adjust from there.
[03:38.370 --> 03:43.130]  So the first thing I'm going to recommend in any breeding project, in almost any project
[03:43.130 --> 03:47.590]  in life, in anything you're working on, before you get started, have a goal and a desired
[03:47.590 --> 03:50.010]  outcome and know what you're getting into.
[03:50.010 --> 03:54.890]  The next thing I'm going to talk about understanding when it comes to breeding is learn about Mendel
[03:54.890 --> 03:56.170]  charts.
[03:56.170 --> 03:58.510]  Understand what Gregor Mendel was trying to teach us.
[03:58.510 --> 04:00.490]  There's a lot of good information in Mendel charts.
[04:00.490 --> 04:03.690]  All you have to do is Google Mendel chart or Gregor Mendel.
[04:03.690 --> 04:05.250]  A lot of info will come up.
[04:05.250 --> 04:09.170]  We may do an episode here on this podcast, but there are plenty of videos about Mendel
[04:09.170 --> 04:10.850]  charts out there.
[04:10.850 --> 04:12.850]  Mendel charts will help you far in your breeding.
[04:12.850 --> 04:15.890]  They will help you predict the outcome of your breeding projects.
[04:15.890 --> 04:19.250]  They'll help you see if you're going to reproduce something that's already been done.
[04:19.250 --> 04:21.670]  They'll help you isolate traits you're looking for.
[04:21.670 --> 04:25.970]  When it comes to line breeding in the future, Mendel charts will definitely help you predict
[04:25.970 --> 04:29.770]  the outcome and anticipate outcomes of your breeding projects.
[04:29.770 --> 04:32.090]  You'll have to learn about dominant and recessive traits.
[04:32.090 --> 04:34.010]  You'll learn about co-dominant traits.
[04:34.010 --> 04:37.330]  You will learn a lot through Mendel charts and through the practice of breeding, but
[04:37.330 --> 04:40.930]  all makes sense once you put it into practice.
[04:40.930 --> 04:45.730]  So learn about Mendel charts, learn about dominant, co-dominant and recessive traits,
[04:45.730 --> 04:49.410]  understand alleles and how alleles are expressed and passed through plants.
[04:49.410 --> 04:53.330]  Then learn which alleles you are looking for in your breeding project.
[04:53.330 --> 04:57.690]  By this point, you've got a good understanding of what you want to create and how to go about
[04:57.690 --> 04:59.110]  creating it.
[04:59.110 --> 05:04.210]  One thing I want to touch on is select your plants by plant appearance and plant traits.
[05:04.210 --> 05:06.230]  Don't select your plants based on names.
[05:06.230 --> 05:09.750]  We're not breeding names just because two plants have cool names.
[05:09.750 --> 05:12.830]  And if you put those two names together, you get an even cooler name.
[05:12.830 --> 05:15.190]  That does not mean that those plants need to be bred with.
[05:15.190 --> 05:16.550]  We're not breeding names.
[05:16.550 --> 05:18.670]  We're not breeding for social media pictures.
[05:18.670 --> 05:22.550]  We are breeding biological material, which has to work well in a breeding project with
[05:22.550 --> 05:23.870]  good results.
[05:23.870 --> 05:27.870]  So focus your breeding more on the things you see from the plants, the things you observe
[05:27.870 --> 05:31.630]  and enjoy more than the hype and the name and things like that.
[05:31.630 --> 05:35.790]  Then you will have much better success in your breeding project.
[05:35.790 --> 05:39.710]  So learn about Mendel charts, understand what Gregor Mendel was teaching us.
[05:39.710 --> 05:43.350]  Then learn about dominant and co-dominant and recessive traits.
[05:43.350 --> 05:46.550]  Learn about how those traits are passed from plant to plant.
[05:46.550 --> 05:50.110]  Understand as much as you can biologically about these plants, which we are going to
[05:50.110 --> 05:51.630]  breed with.
[05:51.630 --> 05:53.710]  Then here's another huge piece of advice.
[05:53.710 --> 05:58.030]  Once you understand the Mendel charts, the traits, the dominant, the co-dominant, the
[05:58.030 --> 06:01.410]  recessive traits, how these things meld together when we are breeding.
[06:01.410 --> 06:05.990]  Once you understand that, forget all of that and breed with love, breed with passion and
[06:05.990 --> 06:07.670]  grow from your heart.
[06:07.670 --> 06:11.230]  Once you understand all of this stuff, you'll be able to look at two plants and go, oh,
[06:11.230 --> 06:15.510]  you and you, I should breed you two together because you've got these traits and you've
[06:15.510 --> 06:17.710]  got these traits and I see magic.
[06:17.710 --> 06:18.710]  You'll learn it.
[06:18.710 --> 06:19.710]  You'll start to feel it.
[06:19.710 --> 06:21.150]  I understand a lot about music.
[06:21.150 --> 06:22.670]  I understand I can count time.
[06:22.670 --> 06:23.790]  I can read and write music.
[06:23.790 --> 06:25.870]  I understand polyrhythms, compound time.
[06:25.870 --> 06:27.870]  I can play with the band very well.
[06:27.870 --> 06:29.270]  I know a lot about music.
[06:29.270 --> 06:33.230]  When I get on stage, I do not think about any of my musical education.
[06:33.230 --> 06:34.230]  I play with groove.
[06:34.230 --> 06:35.230]  I play with funk.
[06:35.230 --> 06:36.230]  I play with my heart.
[06:36.230 --> 06:38.150]  I make sure that I'm matching up with the bass player.
[06:38.150 --> 06:41.070]  I'm making sure that I'm using dynamics when people are singing.
[06:41.070 --> 06:42.510]  I don't think about counting time.
[06:42.510 --> 06:46.270]  I know all of that stuff is in me because I've got a solid education about music and
[06:46.270 --> 06:51.450]  when it comes time to perform, my intuition and my heart take over and I can do it instinctually.
[06:51.450 --> 06:55.650]  If you build a solid education with these plants and a solid education about breeding,
[06:55.650 --> 06:57.450]  you'll be able to grow and breed the same way.
[06:57.450 --> 06:59.890]  You'll just look at plants and you'll know, you'll feel it.
[06:59.890 --> 07:00.890]  They'll tell you.
[07:00.890 --> 07:04.410]  If you listen, the plants are already telling you everything you need to know.
[07:04.410 --> 07:06.290]  So learn about those Mendel charts.
[07:06.290 --> 07:07.470]  Learn about your co-dominant.
[07:07.470 --> 07:09.710]  Learn about your dominant recessive traits.
[07:09.710 --> 07:11.450]  Learn about how pollen works.
[07:11.450 --> 07:13.770]  There's a lot of things to read about pollen.
[07:13.770 --> 07:16.810]  Then once you understand that stuff, write down a goal.
[07:16.810 --> 07:19.370]  Then just breed with love and grow from your heart.
[07:19.370 --> 07:24.210]  Let's talk a little bit more in depth about actually selecting a male plant to pollinate
[07:24.210 --> 07:25.770]  these ladies with.
[07:25.770 --> 07:31.170]  I generally like to start with a male plant that is way different than the targeted female
[07:31.170 --> 07:32.890]  plants, which I like to pollinate.
[07:32.890 --> 07:36.730]  So my example would be, let's just go with my making of Arise.
[07:36.730 --> 07:42.430]  Arise is a golden goat female plant pollinated by a daybreaker male plant.
[07:42.430 --> 07:46.470]  That cross was such a huge success that I chose a male from that to base much of my
[07:46.470 --> 07:48.050]  seed line on for the future.
[07:48.050 --> 07:49.450]  That is my King Solomon male.
[07:49.450 --> 07:51.490]  He came from that batch of seeds.
[07:51.490 --> 07:54.770]  Let's talk about why I chose to breed those together.
[07:54.770 --> 07:59.010]  The golden goat is what we like to call a sativa dominant looking plant.
[07:59.010 --> 08:02.610]  I know the terminology and the words are changing every day in this industry, but we used to
[08:02.610 --> 08:04.550]  call that a sativa plant.
[08:04.550 --> 08:06.370]  It's got longer, skinnier leaves.
[08:06.370 --> 08:09.810]  When you smoke it, you get like a crazy head buzz that makes you kind of psychedelic and
[08:09.810 --> 08:11.310]  freaked out a little bit.
[08:11.310 --> 08:12.310]  It grows taller.
[08:12.310 --> 08:13.430]  It grows skinnier.
[08:13.430 --> 08:15.510]  The daybreaker was the complete opposite.
[08:15.510 --> 08:18.230]  It put out giant, wide, long droopy leaves.
[08:18.230 --> 08:20.010]  You could build a carport with these leaves.
[08:20.010 --> 08:23.790]  You could cover the entire house with just a couple of these leaves and build a shade
[08:23.790 --> 08:24.790]  canopy.
[08:24.790 --> 08:28.630]  It also grew a little bit stretchy, kind of lanky, the complete opposite of the golden
[08:28.630 --> 08:32.890]  goat, which would get tall, but it would keep tighter inner node spaces and more, uh, more
[08:32.890 --> 08:37.430]  of a compact structure where that daybreaker would get a little lanky, a little bit stretchy,
[08:37.430 --> 08:41.230]  have some more space in the nodes, more like that OG Kush sort of a thing.
[08:41.230 --> 08:44.710]  So when I bred them together, there was a lot of room in the middle there for them to
[08:44.910 --> 08:45.910]  meet.
[08:45.910 --> 08:50.110]  Then I also could see what the daybreaker male was doing to the female.
[08:50.110 --> 08:53.830]  So I like to use a male plant that is way different from my female plants.
[08:53.830 --> 08:56.630]  That way I've got opportunity to make new shit.
[08:56.630 --> 09:00.430]  One way to describe it is if I'm trying to make new stuff, I wouldn't pour chocolate
[09:00.430 --> 09:03.430]  and more chocolate in a bowl because I guess what I'm going to get chocolate.
[09:03.430 --> 09:08.290]  I'm going to put some chocolate, maybe some banana in there and get some chocolate banana.
[09:08.290 --> 09:12.310]  Maybe put chocolate and strawberry in the other and get some strawberry banana chocolate,
[09:12.310 --> 09:13.310]  do things like that.
[09:13.310 --> 09:14.310]  Get creative.
[09:14.910 --> 09:18.810]  So I like to do things that are way different, not two plants that are super similar in genetic
[09:18.810 --> 09:19.810]  variety.
[09:19.810 --> 09:25.350]  Now, let's focus in on some of these specific traits that I do look for in a male plant.
[09:25.350 --> 09:29.470]  Things that are really important to me are plant shape and size and structure.
[09:29.470 --> 09:31.510]  What is this plant shaped like?
[09:31.510 --> 09:35.670]  Keep this in mind when you were picking a male plant that is going to be 50% of the
[09:35.670 --> 09:37.430]  outcome of your offspring.
[09:37.430 --> 09:39.310]  So do you want these, uh, your seeds?
[09:39.310 --> 09:42.710]  Do you want them to make tall, skinny plants, short squat plants?
[09:42.710 --> 09:44.290]  Do you want short inner node spacing?
[09:44.290 --> 09:46.130]  Do you want longer node spacing?
[09:46.130 --> 09:47.930]  Do you want plants that branch out real far?
[09:47.930 --> 09:49.650]  Do you want plants that stay in kind of skinny?
[09:49.650 --> 09:53.030]  Do you want them to grow real tall or stay kind of squat?
[09:53.030 --> 09:57.410]  You can kind of set yourself up for this by selecting a male plant that has these traits
[09:57.410 --> 09:58.650]  that you are looking for.
[09:58.650 --> 10:01.170]  This is when you start making those decisions.
[10:01.170 --> 10:06.330]  So plant shape, plant structure, plant size, plant sturdiness, or the branches of your
[10:06.330 --> 10:09.810]  male plant nice and sturdy, or are they all weak and wispy and shitty?
[10:09.810 --> 10:13.090]  Because if you breed with that weak, wispy, shitty male, guess what you're going to have
[10:13.090 --> 10:16.650]  the opportunity for weak, wispy, shitty offspring.
[10:16.650 --> 10:18.270]  So keep that in mind.
[10:18.270 --> 10:21.010]  Something I think about is amount of branching.
[10:21.010 --> 10:22.730]  Does it make a lot of lateral branching?
[10:22.730 --> 10:24.190]  Does it keep going straight up?
[10:24.190 --> 10:25.610]  How does this plant branch?
[10:25.610 --> 10:27.970]  Once the branches come out, do they make more branches?
[10:27.970 --> 10:30.010]  Do those branches make a lot of shoots?
[10:30.010 --> 10:32.090]  Is that the structure I'm looking for?
[10:32.090 --> 10:35.130]  That is something I keep in mind when selecting a male plant.
[10:35.130 --> 10:37.690]  I mentioned this a moment ago, inter node spacing.
[10:37.690 --> 10:40.890]  So you've got your main stock coming up the middle of the plant.
[10:40.890 --> 10:42.890]  You've got branches coming off of there.
[10:42.890 --> 10:46.170]  How far apart are those main branches coming off the stock?
[10:46.170 --> 10:48.330]  That is inter nodal spacing.
[10:48.330 --> 10:50.010]  Sometimes there'll be a half inch apart.
[10:50.010 --> 10:52.170]  Sometimes there'll be four or five inches apart.
[10:52.170 --> 10:55.490]  If you're getting some older tropical shit, maybe some golden goat crosses, they'll be
[10:55.490 --> 10:56.570]  really close together.
[10:56.570 --> 10:59.110]  The Jack the Ripper stuff might be close together.
[10:59.110 --> 11:03.370]  Some of the OG Kush crosses, the presidential Kush, there's going to be some space between
[11:03.370 --> 11:04.370]  there.
[11:04.370 --> 11:05.370]  What do you need?
[11:05.370 --> 11:08.610]  If you're growing in a place with high humidity, you may want some more space in there so you
[11:08.610 --> 11:11.570]  don't get big chunky buds that get a lot of room for humidity.
[11:11.570 --> 11:13.850]  If you're in a tropical place, that might help you out.
[11:13.850 --> 11:18.330]  If you're in a colder, drier area, you might be able to handle bigger nugs with more density.
[11:18.330 --> 11:20.170]  They're not going to get the humidity in there.
[11:20.170 --> 11:24.270]  It's all about what you're breeding for, what your goal is, how much inter node spacing
[11:24.270 --> 11:25.270]  do you want?
[11:25.270 --> 11:29.050]  Also, flower clusters are very important when it comes to selecting a male plant.
[11:29.050 --> 11:30.450]  Look at that big flower cluster.
[11:30.450 --> 11:31.770]  Do you get one big top?
[11:31.770 --> 11:33.490]  Do you get a bunch of flowers everywhere?
[11:33.490 --> 11:37.930]  That's going to show you what your male plant, what your offspring is going to do.
[11:37.930 --> 11:39.290]  Let's talk about leaf shape.
[11:39.290 --> 11:42.290]  Leaf shape is a big indicator of things in my opinion.
[11:42.290 --> 11:46.570]  Leaf shape is kind of how I decide how long a plant is going to take to flower for the
[11:46.570 --> 11:47.690]  first time that I run it.
[11:47.690 --> 11:52.030]  If it's got big, wide, broad leaves, it's not going to take you more than 70 days most
[11:52.030 --> 11:53.030]  of the time.
[11:53.030 --> 11:58.130]  If it's got those long, skinny, tropical leaves, that's probably a 70, 77 day, maybe even more
[11:58.130 --> 12:01.110]  on the flowering side of the plant scale.
[12:01.110 --> 12:03.210]  Leaf shape, what size of leaves are you looking for?
[12:03.210 --> 12:04.970]  Do you like those long, skinny leaves?
[12:04.970 --> 12:06.810]  Do you like big, fat leaves?
[12:06.810 --> 12:08.410]  What kind of product are you looking for?
[12:08.410 --> 12:10.050]  This is going to play heavily.
[12:10.050 --> 12:13.890]  This leaf shape and size is going to transfer into your offspring.
[12:13.890 --> 12:15.850]  Then what about amount of leaves?
[12:15.850 --> 12:17.690]  I don't like too many leaves on my plants.
[12:17.690 --> 12:22.650]  I don't want to trim all day, every day, but I need enough leaves for production and photosynthesis.
[12:22.650 --> 12:23.650]  So amount of leaves.
[12:23.650 --> 12:28.290]  If that male plant is just banging out tons and tons of leaf and not a lot of bud structure,
[12:28.290 --> 12:33.210]  not a lot of flower cluster, not building strong stems and not being even with its energy
[12:33.210 --> 12:36.770]  distribution, I may not choose that male plant to go into my garden.
[12:36.770 --> 12:40.970]  If it's super duper leafy, I don't want to spend a bunch of energy on leaves and trimming
[12:40.970 --> 12:43.770]  a bunch of leaves in my flower product.
[12:43.770 --> 12:46.610]  Let's talk about something super important, flower time.
[12:46.610 --> 12:51.930]  How long did it take for that male plant to start giving you sufficient amounts of pollen?
[12:51.930 --> 12:56.170]  How long does it take for that male plant to flower out and make a big, giant, fat male
[12:56.170 --> 12:57.170]  cluster?
[12:57.170 --> 12:58.170]  Let your male plants go.
[12:58.170 --> 13:01.690]  I let mine go for like eight or nine weeks, maybe 10 weeks the first time I run them to
[13:01.690 --> 13:03.730]  see what they're going to give me.
[13:03.730 --> 13:05.430]  So keep an eye on that flowering time.
[13:05.430 --> 13:07.590]  How long until they started giving you pollen?
[13:07.590 --> 13:10.550]  How long does that male plant continue to give you pollen?
[13:10.550 --> 13:12.290]  Then how big did that main top get?
[13:12.290 --> 13:14.110]  How big do those side buds get?
[13:14.110 --> 13:18.350]  Pay attention to the flowering time and how long it does continue to flower.
[13:18.350 --> 13:20.910]  Also while it's flowering, pay attention to how tall it gets.
[13:20.910 --> 13:22.750]  Does it have a big stretch time?
[13:22.750 --> 13:25.390]  Did it do anything crazy during that flowering phase?
[13:25.390 --> 13:29.150]  Note that because that is going to correlate to your offspring.
[13:29.150 --> 13:32.190]  Now here's when we get into some of the fun, more obvious parts.
[13:32.190 --> 13:37.710]  Are there any colors, flavors, aromas, or visual appearances or other senses that you
[13:37.710 --> 13:39.870]  can use to detect obvious things?
[13:39.870 --> 13:40.870]  Does it smell good?
[13:40.870 --> 13:42.150]  Does it smell bad?
[13:42.150 --> 13:43.210]  I like a male plant.
[13:43.210 --> 13:46.350]  This is a weird thing that I'm going to share with you, a weird piece of advice.
[13:46.350 --> 13:50.670]  I like a male plant that if I give it a stem rub, if it kind of smells like vomit or bar
[13:50.670 --> 13:52.750]  trash can, that's a keeper.
[13:52.750 --> 13:56.510]  That plant is going to be very good for breeding, in my opinion.
[13:56.510 --> 13:57.790]  I really do like that.
[13:57.790 --> 14:01.970]  So look for things like colors, aromas, flavors.
[14:01.970 --> 14:03.730]  Most people don't smoke the males.
[14:03.730 --> 14:06.930]  There is one old school breeder out there who will shake the pollen off, dry them, and
[14:06.930 --> 14:07.930]  smoke them.
[14:07.930 --> 14:08.930]  I don't do that.
[14:08.930 --> 14:10.450]  If you want to do that, that is up to you.
[14:10.450 --> 14:12.610]  You're a better man than me.
[14:12.610 --> 14:17.510]  Another thing we definitely need to pay attention to is problems and resistance to problems
[14:17.510 --> 14:18.830]  in the grow.
[14:18.830 --> 14:21.950]  How does this male plant react to overfeeding?
[14:21.950 --> 14:24.170]  How does it react to underfeeding?
[14:24.170 --> 14:26.330]  If these plants are little pussies, guess what?
[14:26.330 --> 14:28.010]  You're going to breed little pussy plants.
[14:28.010 --> 14:30.810]  We want plants that can handle a little bit of abuse.
[14:30.810 --> 14:34.330]  We're going to put these plants in grow rooms where things may go wrong.
[14:34.330 --> 14:36.770]  So we don't want 100% sissy plants.
[14:36.770 --> 14:39.450]  We need some kind of robust, resistant plants.
[14:39.450 --> 14:41.590]  So how do they handle overfeed?
[14:41.590 --> 14:43.370]  How do they handle underfeed?
[14:43.370 --> 14:45.250]  How do they handle over or underwater?
[14:45.250 --> 14:46.990]  Can they take a little bit of a drought?
[14:46.990 --> 14:48.530]  Can they get drowned a little bit?
[14:48.530 --> 14:53.610]  I make seeds for commercial production and for retail sales.
[14:53.610 --> 14:58.090]  So if those seeds can't take some abuse, some of my retail customers may murder the seeds
[14:58.090 --> 15:00.370]  and I wouldn't have a good, successful company.
[15:00.370 --> 15:04.490]  So I've got to breed with things that can take a little bit of abuse.
[15:04.490 --> 15:07.850]  How about resistance to pathogens?
[15:07.850 --> 15:09.690]  Did you get any powdery mildew in that grow?
[15:09.690 --> 15:10.970]  Did you have any bud rot?
[15:10.970 --> 15:13.110]  How did those male plants deal with that?
[15:13.110 --> 15:14.310]  How about bugs?
[15:14.310 --> 15:15.770]  Did you get any spider mites in there?
[15:15.770 --> 15:17.850]  Did you get thrips or fungus gnats?
[15:17.850 --> 15:20.490]  Did those bugs go toward your male plant?
[15:20.490 --> 15:24.870]  If those bugs and pathogens did go near that male plant, how did that plant take it?
[15:24.870 --> 15:29.490]  We want to breed with plants that can handle problems very well because like I keep saying,
[15:29.610 --> 15:32.250]  that is going to pass into your offspring.
[15:32.250 --> 15:34.770]  All right, we've talked about the traits I'm looking for.
[15:34.770 --> 15:39.090]  Now let's talk more specifically about how to find these male plants, which we are looking
[15:39.090 --> 15:40.750]  for for breeding.
[15:40.750 --> 15:43.930]  Of course, the starting point is to pop some seeds.
[15:43.930 --> 15:46.250]  However many seeds you've got, however many you can run.
[15:46.250 --> 15:48.370]  I don't know the legalities in your area.
[15:48.370 --> 15:53.290]  I don't know how much space you've got, but grow as many seeds as you can is my recommendation.
[15:53.290 --> 15:58.050]  I like to run at least one, maybe two or three packs of seeds to find a male plant.
[15:58.050 --> 16:00.290]  If you've only got one, you will find a keeper in there.
[16:00.290 --> 16:04.530]  I always say that you will find a keeper in every 10 pack of my seeds, which means you
[16:04.530 --> 16:07.210]  will also find a good male in there.
[16:07.210 --> 16:10.930]  But of course, the more numbers you've got, the merrier, the more opportunity to find
[16:10.930 --> 16:13.330]  that outlier, that amazing stud male.
[16:13.330 --> 16:14.850]  That's how I found King Solomon.
[16:14.850 --> 16:18.410]  Anyway, step one is to get some seeds and germinate them.
[16:18.410 --> 16:20.130]  Get them growing.
[16:20.130 --> 16:24.690]  Then identify the males and the females, obviously is going to be our next step.
[16:24.690 --> 16:27.410]  If you want to run the females in another room, do that.
[16:27.410 --> 16:28.770]  That's a whole other conversation.
[16:28.770 --> 16:29.770]  That's another podcast.
[16:29.770 --> 16:32.770]  In this episode, we're going to focus on the boys.
[16:32.770 --> 16:34.210]  So we've germinated some seeds.
[16:34.210 --> 16:36.290]  We have identified the boys and girls.
[16:36.290 --> 16:39.930]  We're going to move the boys to another room and that's what we're going to focus on for
[16:39.930 --> 16:41.010]  now.
[16:41.010 --> 16:45.370]  Before we get too far, let me recommend that if you do want to repeat this process, I recommend
[16:45.370 --> 16:49.050]  getting clones from these plants as soon as you can.
[16:49.050 --> 16:54.410]  And before we go into flower, it is a little bit more challenging to revege a male plant
[16:54.410 --> 16:57.770]  than it is a female plant, in my opinion.
[16:57.770 --> 17:01.770]  In my experience, it is harder to revege the boys than it is the girls.
[17:01.770 --> 17:06.770]  So I would recommend you get clones before we do go into flower with these male plants.
[17:06.770 --> 17:09.450]  So at this point, we have separated our males and females.
[17:09.450 --> 17:10.450]  We've gotten clones.
[17:10.450 --> 17:13.770]  Now we are going to put these plants into flower.
[17:13.770 --> 17:18.250]  When it comes to selecting a male plant, I generally do not choose the male plant that
[17:18.250 --> 17:22.530]  shows flower very first as a breeding candidate.
[17:22.530 --> 17:24.490]  So let me start with 10 seeds.
[17:24.490 --> 17:25.970]  Let's say I started with 10 seeds.
[17:25.970 --> 17:27.970]  A lot of you are going to start with 10.
[17:27.970 --> 17:29.330]  We'll germinate 10 seeds.
[17:29.330 --> 17:33.010]  Out of those 10, we're going to find probably five males, five females.
[17:33.010 --> 17:36.850]  That's usually the way nature works, about 50, 50, 50%.
[17:36.850 --> 17:38.530]  Sometimes you're going to see 60, 40.
[17:38.530 --> 17:39.530]  Let's work with what we get.
[17:39.530 --> 17:41.250]  We're going to pull the females aside.
[17:41.250 --> 17:46.650]  Let's say at this point, we've got approximately five male seedlings to work with here.
[17:46.650 --> 17:50.850]  I'm going to get clones like I mentioned, then I'm going to put them into flower.
[17:50.850 --> 17:53.930]  Once they're into flower, they're going to begin to show me the sex.
[17:53.930 --> 17:59.050]  From those five, I will not choose the first or probably even the second plant to show
[17:59.050 --> 18:02.150]  me that it is a male for my breeding male.
[18:02.150 --> 18:08.130]  The reason behind this is I find that that male is probably usually most commonly going
[18:08.130 --> 18:11.570]  to dominate my crosses of everything that I make.
[18:11.570 --> 18:15.230]  So what I'm saying is let's just say that that male is chocolate.
[18:15.230 --> 18:17.450]  Like I used earlier, I used chocolate as an example.
[18:17.450 --> 18:23.090]  If I use that chocolate, everything I pollinate with that chocolate is going to be dominantly
[18:23.090 --> 18:24.090]  chocolate.
[18:24.090 --> 18:28.730]  Even if I cross it to, like I said earlier, strawberries, bananas, whatever else I cross
[18:28.730 --> 18:33.950]  it to, it's going to kind of be more chocolate with a little bananas, more chocolate with
[18:33.950 --> 18:35.530]  a little strawberries.
[18:35.530 --> 18:39.570]  So I choose not to use those first couple of males that show me that they're male because
[18:39.570 --> 18:41.330]  they're just going to dominate the cross.
[18:41.330 --> 18:42.770]  It's going to be too much of them.
[18:42.770 --> 18:44.810]  I don't want to just make copies of this male plant.
[18:44.810 --> 18:49.450]  I want to make 50-50 crosses or somewhere near there and that's not going to do it.
[18:49.450 --> 18:54.570]  So usually the first one or two plants that show me their males are not the candidates
[18:54.570 --> 18:56.330]  which I choose for breeding.
[18:56.330 --> 18:58.450]  It's also usually not the last one.
[18:58.450 --> 19:03.390]  It's usually the third or fourth male to show me that it is male that I choose for the breeding
[19:03.390 --> 19:04.490]  project.
[19:04.490 --> 19:09.050]  Here's a hint also, early in flower, most of the plants that are male are going to show
[19:09.050 --> 19:12.170]  you their boys because they'll stretch up above everybody else.
[19:12.170 --> 19:13.330]  They'll be the taller plants.
[19:13.330 --> 19:17.250]  Those males try to get taller so they could drop the pollen down on the ladies which are
[19:17.250 --> 19:18.250]  down below them.
[19:18.250 --> 19:19.250]  So pay attention to that.
[19:19.250 --> 19:22.290]  That may give you a little bit of heads up, something to look for.
[19:22.290 --> 19:25.810]  All right, so I don't choose that first guy to start showing pollen, to start shooting
[19:25.810 --> 19:26.810]  his load.
[19:26.810 --> 19:27.810]  Probably not the second guy.
[19:27.810 --> 19:30.850]  It's usually the third or the fourth plant that starts making pollen.
[19:30.850 --> 19:35.450]  And my reason is because I don't want that super dominant male, that early flower with
[19:35.450 --> 19:38.250]  all that testosterone, all that male stuff going on.
[19:38.250 --> 19:40.390]  I don't need that going into the cross.
[19:40.390 --> 19:42.930]  So I generally choose that third or fourth male.
[19:42.930 --> 19:45.130]  It's usually not the fifth one out of a pack of 10.
[19:45.130 --> 19:46.170]  It's usually not the fifth.
[19:46.170 --> 19:48.450]  It's honestly generally the third or fourth.
[19:48.450 --> 19:53.330]  I'll choose the one with the shape, the structure, the pollen time, the one that is closest to
[19:53.330 --> 19:56.370]  the traits I'm looking for between number three and four.
[19:56.370 --> 19:57.610]  That'll be the one that I choose.
[19:57.610 --> 19:59.490]  So let's say we've made our selection.
[19:59.490 --> 20:00.650]  You've got to choose now.
[20:00.650 --> 20:02.910]  This is where it comes time for you to make that decision.
[20:02.910 --> 20:06.210]  This is the plant you're going to choose for your breeding project.
[20:06.210 --> 20:10.810]  Use your education, use my advice, use your intuition and choose that male plant that
[20:10.810 --> 20:12.130]  looks the best.
[20:12.130 --> 20:14.610]  The only thing that's going to go wrong if you choose the wrong one is you're going to
[20:14.610 --> 20:15.890]  have to go back and breed again.
[20:15.890 --> 20:16.930]  It's not a huge mistake.
[20:16.930 --> 20:17.930]  It's not a huge problem.
[20:17.930 --> 20:18.930]  It's fun.
[20:18.930 --> 20:19.930]  We get to do it again.
[20:19.930 --> 20:22.570]  If especially if it's your first time, you get to see what you made.
[20:22.570 --> 20:24.210]  If it's awesome, fucking awesome.
[20:24.210 --> 20:26.490]  If it's not awesome, it's still going to be great.
[20:26.490 --> 20:27.930]  It just may not be fucking amazing.
[20:27.930 --> 20:31.010]  You made a bunch of seeds you get to grow and have fun with and you learned a lot.
[20:31.010 --> 20:32.930]  Then you get to go and do it again.
[20:32.930 --> 20:34.090]  But now the pressure's on.
[20:34.090 --> 20:36.130]  Now it is time for you to select that male plant.
[20:36.130 --> 20:37.570]  Do you want number three?
[20:37.570 --> 20:39.050]  Do you want number four?
[20:39.050 --> 20:40.630]  Make your decision.
[20:40.630 --> 20:41.930]  Now it's time for the fun part.
[20:42.730 --> 20:43.730]  Now we put the plants in the room.
[20:43.730 --> 20:47.730]  We time it perfectly so that those plants can give and receive pollen and then we can
[20:47.730 --> 20:49.410]  make seeds.
[20:49.410 --> 20:52.690]  It's easy to time up those plants the first time you put the male, you put the female
[20:52.690 --> 20:56.610]  in the room on the same day, you put them into flower and you watch.
[20:56.610 --> 21:01.250]  A lot of times I'll put the male in the flower room a little bit before the females.
[21:01.250 --> 21:03.970]  Sometimes I'll stagger the females into the rooms at different times.
[21:03.970 --> 21:07.970]  You will have to figure out when your male plant produces the most pollen and when your
[21:07.970 --> 21:10.770]  female plants are ready to receive that pollen.
[21:10.770 --> 21:14.410]  When those pistils are big and ripe looking like dandelions, that's when they want the
[21:14.410 --> 21:15.410]  pollen.
[21:15.410 --> 21:18.490]  So the first time you do the cross, you can just put them in there at the same time.
[21:18.490 --> 21:19.490]  It will work.
[21:19.490 --> 21:20.730]  Then pay attention.
[21:20.730 --> 21:21.890]  When does the pollen happen?
[21:21.890 --> 21:23.170]  When does peak ripeness happen?
[21:23.170 --> 21:26.570]  Then you can adjust your schedule accordingly for future runs.
[21:26.570 --> 21:30.410]  The first run you'll get plenty of seeds doing it just the natural way.
[21:30.410 --> 21:34.450]  So get your male plant, get your selected female plants, put them in the room and let
[21:34.450 --> 21:35.790]  the pollen happen.
[21:35.790 --> 21:40.130]  Some people will put that male plant in front of a fan, let that fan blow it around.
[21:40.130 --> 21:43.090]  Honestly, that male plant is going to pop open those flowers and the pollen is going
[21:43.090 --> 21:44.890]  to go moving around naturally.
[21:44.890 --> 21:49.530]  I've also seen people cut the top off and just shake that top around and pollinate everything.
[21:49.530 --> 21:53.450]  However you choose to do it, get that pollen all throughout that room, pollinate those
[21:53.450 --> 21:54.450]  females.
[21:54.450 --> 21:57.570]  Then it's really important to let those seeds finish.
[21:57.570 --> 22:03.210]  You can run my suggested light cycle of 18 on and 6 hours off or you can do 12, 12.
[22:03.210 --> 22:04.370]  That is up to you.
[22:04.370 --> 22:05.990]  Both of those will work.
[22:05.990 --> 22:08.450]  The most important part is let the seeds finish.
[22:08.450 --> 22:11.050]  Then carefully harvest those seeds, get them out of your plants.
[22:11.050 --> 22:13.330]  That is a whole other podcast episode.
[22:13.330 --> 22:15.530]  I think I've done that episode before.
[22:15.530 --> 22:16.770]  Now here comes the fun part.
[22:16.770 --> 22:18.810]  We get to grow out these seeds.
[22:18.810 --> 22:22.730]  Before we grow these, let's talk a little bit about why I like to pollinate multiple
[22:22.730 --> 22:26.650]  female plants with one male plant in a breeding run.
[22:26.650 --> 22:31.210]  The reason I do this is because now I can see what that male plant has contributed to
[22:31.210 --> 22:34.690]  the breeding project to multiple different females.
[22:34.690 --> 22:37.810]  If I did, let's just go back to my old chocolate analogy.
[22:37.810 --> 22:39.650]  Let's say I bred chocolate to banana.
[22:39.650 --> 22:41.730]  I bred chocolate to strawberry.
[22:41.730 --> 22:44.890]  Just for fun, we'll say that I bred chocolate to key lime.
[22:44.890 --> 22:49.010]  If I just bred it to one, I could get an idea of what is happening in my project.
[22:49.010 --> 22:53.210]  I could say this one came out a lot of the chocolate traits and some of the strawberry
[22:53.210 --> 22:54.210]  traits.
[22:54.210 --> 22:59.770]  Maybe it's got the leaf shape of the chocolate and the tallness of the strawberry and 50-50
[22:59.770 --> 23:01.330]  chocolate and strawberry flavor.
[23:01.330 --> 23:04.570]  Now I only have an idea of what the chocolate plant is passing.
[23:04.650 --> 23:07.930]  Is it passing that leaf structure or whatever I attributed to the chocolate?
[23:07.930 --> 23:10.570]  I know it's doing that, but is that an anomaly?
[23:10.570 --> 23:12.390]  Is that what's going to happen commonly?
[23:12.390 --> 23:13.890]  Is that just one time?
[23:13.890 --> 23:16.210]  Is that a recessive or a dominant trait?
[23:16.210 --> 23:20.230]  So what I want to do is check with other female plants and see what traits.
[23:20.230 --> 23:21.850]  So I did strawberry, right?
[23:21.850 --> 23:23.010]  I said banana.
[23:23.010 --> 23:27.250]  When I did the chocolate to banana, what was common with that strawberry cross?
[23:27.250 --> 23:30.890]  When I grew out the seeds from the strawberry and the banana cross, what do I see which
[23:30.890 --> 23:31.890]  is common?
[23:31.890 --> 23:34.570]  Do I see things coming from the male plant like leaf shape?
[23:34.570 --> 23:38.730]  Are there commonalities in the leaf shape, commonalities in structure?
[23:38.730 --> 23:41.810]  I know what the female plants look like when we flower them.
[23:41.810 --> 23:45.850]  Now I need to take those traits, identify the trait that came from the female, identify
[23:45.850 --> 23:49.730]  the trait that came from the male and learn what that male is passing.
[23:49.730 --> 23:52.490]  It's easier to do if I pollinate multiple females.
[23:52.490 --> 23:55.410]  So now I put it to strawberry, put it to banana.
[23:55.410 --> 23:58.090]  Let's see what happens when I crossed it to the key lime pie.
[23:58.090 --> 23:59.690]  How much of the key lime am I tasting?
[23:59.690 --> 24:01.090]  Am I seeing that big leaf shape?
[24:01.090 --> 24:02.970]  Am I seeing the skinny leaves?
[24:02.970 --> 24:03.970]  Where are the commonalities?
[24:03.970 --> 24:09.250]  If in all of those crosses I get like this weird diesel feel aroma that I didn't know
[24:09.250 --> 24:11.490]  about that's probably coming from the chocolate.
[24:11.490 --> 24:15.090]  If they all have different flavors, that's coming from the mother plant.
[24:15.090 --> 24:17.830]  Probably that flavor trait didn't get passed.
[24:17.830 --> 24:22.010]  So that's how we learn what the male plant is going to do in our crosses is by hitting
[24:22.010 --> 24:26.850]  multiple females with it, growing out those seeds, taking notes and observing traits and
[24:26.850 --> 24:29.690]  then attributing, oh, those traits go to the male plant.
[24:29.690 --> 24:34.090]  Those traits go to the female plants and then find the commonalities in those traits.
[24:34.090 --> 24:37.850]  And that's probably what the male plant is delivering to that mix.
[24:37.850 --> 24:39.970]  Now here's something that's really going to throw you off.
[24:39.970 --> 24:43.370]  You're going to see shit that isn't in the male plant or the female plant.
[24:43.370 --> 24:46.170]  Those are going to be traits that came from the grandparents.
[24:46.170 --> 24:49.810]  So maybe that male plant didn't show you that it had something going on in it.
[24:49.810 --> 24:53.250]  Maybe it didn't show you that it'll put out red leaves at week seven.
[24:53.250 --> 24:54.470]  Maybe you didn't know that.
[24:54.470 --> 24:57.850]  Maybe that came from the purple Thai plant that it was his mom or something.
[24:57.850 --> 25:01.850]  So the mom of the male plant put out red plants at weeks or red leaves a week seven.
[25:01.850 --> 25:02.850]  We didn't know that.
[25:02.850 --> 25:06.250]  We didn't see that in the male plant, but now it popped up in the offspring.
[25:06.250 --> 25:09.250]  So that was a recessive trait that we didn't find until we bred.
[25:09.250 --> 25:10.370]  They came from a grandparent.
[25:10.370 --> 25:13.210]  You're going to see things like that in your breeding projects.
[25:13.210 --> 25:17.730]  So I like to know if I'm using plant a and plant B, I like to know the parents of plant
[25:17.730 --> 25:19.730]  a and plant B.
[25:19.730 --> 25:22.090]  And even further sometimes I like to know their parents.
[25:22.090 --> 25:25.450]  So you're doing like four and then two and then one on the family tree.
[25:25.450 --> 25:27.530]  I like to know that much info.
[25:28.210 --> 25:32.490]  It also helped me identify recessive traits, dominant co-dominant traits, helps me a little
[25:32.490 --> 25:35.530]  bit with my predictions in my Mendel charts.
[25:35.530 --> 25:36.530]  Just helps me to know.
[25:36.530 --> 25:41.970]  And then also helps me not do too much in breeding and double crossing, over crossing,
[25:41.970 --> 25:45.990]  back crossing on accident, which I do on purpose sometimes, but I don't want to do it too much
[25:45.990 --> 25:50.490]  on accident because like I said before, I have the best success when things are more
[25:50.490 --> 25:51.490]  different.
[25:51.490 --> 25:54.190]  If you cross OG to OG, you just get fucking OG.
[25:54.190 --> 25:56.490]  If you cross, I'm not OG.
[25:56.490 --> 25:57.490]  I see something way different.
[25:57.490 --> 25:59.690]  I'm just going to say strawberries to lemons.
[25:59.690 --> 26:01.250]  You could really tell you get strawberry and lemons.
[26:01.250 --> 26:02.690]  You could tell those different flavors together.
[26:02.690 --> 26:05.810]  If you put gas and candy together, you could tell candy gas.
[26:05.810 --> 26:08.570]  If you put gas and gas together, what you can just make more gas.
[26:08.570 --> 26:09.930]  It's hard to tell what you're making.
[26:09.930 --> 26:12.690]  All right, let me keep going here.
[26:12.690 --> 26:17.130]  Because I do want to touch on how I, that is basically how I select a male plant for
[26:17.130 --> 26:18.130]  breeding.
[26:18.130 --> 26:21.530]  It's got to have a specific traits, which I am looking for, for the breeding project.
[26:21.530 --> 26:27.370]  It's got to have the leaf shape, the leaf size, structure, flavor, aroma, bug resistance,
[26:27.370 --> 26:28.450]  pathogen resistance.
[26:28.450 --> 26:29.930]  It's got to have all of that stuff.
[26:29.930 --> 26:33.310]  It's got to make the right amount of pollen at the right time.
[26:33.310 --> 26:38.210]  Probably not the first or second male to show me that it is the male in the bunch.
[26:38.210 --> 26:42.850]  And then the only way to verify that is to pollinate, pollinate multiple plants, then
[26:42.850 --> 26:44.370]  grow those seeds out.
[26:44.370 --> 26:45.450]  See what you have created.
[26:45.450 --> 26:48.890]  Look for those traits that come from the male plant, like I've said, then attribute those
[26:48.890 --> 26:50.170]  to the male plant.
[26:50.170 --> 26:54.330]  And then that's how you know what that male plant is contributing to your breeding project.
[26:54.330 --> 26:55.790]  That's how I select a male.
[26:55.790 --> 26:58.130]  That is exactly how I do it.
[26:58.130 --> 26:59.770]  There's no magic or no voodoo.
[26:59.770 --> 27:04.490]  I use intention and I have a goal and I use my intuition and my education to find a male
[27:04.490 --> 27:06.490]  that I think will reach my goal.
[27:06.490 --> 27:08.490]  Again, the most important part is a goal.
[27:08.490 --> 27:13.890]  Now, I do want to touch on how I select a female plant that I do want to reverse to
[27:13.890 --> 27:18.850]  create pollen to use for a feminized seed run.
[27:18.850 --> 27:22.690]  It's very similar to the way that I select a male plant for breeding.
[27:22.690 --> 27:25.970]  The plant has to be what I call a perfect 10.
[27:25.970 --> 27:29.610]  I don't know in your criteria what plant is a perfect 10.
[27:29.610 --> 27:33.990]  It's got to have flavor, aroma, buzz, the right effects.
[27:33.990 --> 27:38.990]  If it's a medicinal effect or a recreational effect, it's got to have the effects I'm after.
[27:38.990 --> 27:42.890]  It's got to have the right height, the right shape, the right structure, the right flowering
[27:42.890 --> 27:43.890]  time.
[27:43.890 --> 27:48.250]  Then some of the more important stuff that we overlook, it's got to have pest resistance.
[27:48.250 --> 27:51.290]  I don't need a plant that waves hey, hey, hey to spider mites.
[27:51.290 --> 27:53.810]  I need a plant that goes, hey, spider mites, fuck off.
[27:53.810 --> 27:56.210]  There's some plants the spider mites won't even go near.
[27:56.210 --> 27:57.450]  I like those plants.
[27:57.450 --> 27:58.890]  Breed with those bad bitches.
[27:58.890 --> 28:01.130]  I like plants that are mold resistant.
[28:01.130 --> 28:05.090]  I've been sending seeds and plants all over the country lately and I am starting to learn
[28:05.090 --> 28:09.450]  very well what plants do work well in certain parts of our country.
[28:09.450 --> 28:13.530]  Plants that are mold resistant are very sought after for breeding to sending those seeds
[28:13.530 --> 28:17.450]  to each coast, the northeast coast, the northwest coast.
[28:17.450 --> 28:19.930]  Both of them need very mold resistant plants.
[28:19.930 --> 28:22.170]  So find something that is mold resistant.
[28:22.170 --> 28:26.330]  If it's powdery mildew, if it's bud rot, any of the molds out there, find a plant that
[28:26.330 --> 28:29.690]  does not get that shit when you put it in that environment.
[28:29.690 --> 28:31.850]  Find plants that are drought resistant.
[28:31.850 --> 28:35.290]  Find plants that can be over watered, a plant that can be drowned a little bit.
[28:35.290 --> 28:37.610]  Plants that can take abuse and stress.
[28:37.610 --> 28:41.170]  Plants that can take popping, twisting, lollipopping, defoliating.
[28:41.170 --> 28:44.250]  It needs to be able to take all of the shit that I'm going to throw at it.
[28:44.250 --> 28:48.010]  When it comes to reversing a plant, I need it to be a perfect 10 and I need it to have
[28:48.010 --> 28:51.570]  all the traits that I'm looking for in a male plant and even more.
[28:51.570 --> 28:56.770]  It's got to be even better than a male plant because the females, I can grow them, I can
[28:56.770 --> 29:01.330]  smoke them, I can turn them into concentrates, I can smoke them as flowers, I can see what
[29:01.330 --> 29:02.330]  I'm working with.
[29:02.330 --> 29:05.530]  So I already know what they're going to look like in the female form.
[29:05.530 --> 29:08.610]  So they have got to be super stellar.
[29:08.610 --> 29:10.250]  Let's talk about some examples.
[29:10.250 --> 29:12.490]  Super stellar plants that were 10s.
[29:12.490 --> 29:13.490]  Golden goat.
[29:13.730 --> 29:15.330]  I chose to reverse golden goat.
[29:15.330 --> 29:17.050]  That plant is a perfect 10.
[29:17.050 --> 29:18.210]  It grows well.
[29:18.210 --> 29:19.650]  It's got a killer buzz.
[29:19.650 --> 29:21.090]  It tastes amazing.
[29:21.090 --> 29:24.930]  And if you get it going strong and you take care of it, that plant thrives.
[29:24.930 --> 29:26.990]  You almost can't mess it up.
[29:26.990 --> 29:27.990]  You could pee in it.
[29:27.990 --> 29:28.990]  You could kick it over.
[29:28.990 --> 29:30.250]  You can overfeed it, underfeed it.
[29:30.250 --> 29:31.250]  You could give it a drought.
[29:31.250 --> 29:32.370]  You could give it too much water.
[29:32.370 --> 29:33.370]  You can overheat it.
[29:33.370 --> 29:34.570]  You could freeze it.
[29:34.570 --> 29:38.090]  Golden goat's just going to keep on growing and produce badass flowers for you.
[29:38.090 --> 29:41.810]  So golden goat is a perfect 10 in my opinion.
[29:41.810 --> 29:44.770]  Another one that I found to be a perfect 10 and somebody else agreed with me.
[29:44.770 --> 29:46.890]  I've talked about why I reversed this one.
[29:46.890 --> 29:51.970]  The blueberry cookies that made the turtle wine was a perfect, is a perfect 10.
[29:51.970 --> 29:52.970]  That plant tastes good.
[29:52.970 --> 29:54.050]  It grows well.
[29:54.050 --> 29:55.250]  It's got a killer buzz to it.
[29:55.250 --> 29:56.770]  It doesn't get problems.
[29:56.770 --> 29:59.170]  It grows with huge vigor.
[29:59.170 --> 30:02.690]  Like I said before, you could piss in it and it will still keep on growing.
[30:02.690 --> 30:04.810]  So that's why I chose the blueberry cookies.
[30:04.810 --> 30:07.370]  And my third example, the grateful dog.
[30:07.370 --> 30:09.290]  The grateful dog is a perfect fucking 10.
[30:09.290 --> 30:13.690]  That flavor, the aroma, the colors, that plant is a perfect 10.
[30:13.690 --> 30:16.350]  That's why I chose those plants as reversals.
[30:16.350 --> 30:18.050]  So use those as your standard.
[30:18.050 --> 30:21.470]  The grateful dog, the blueberry cookies and golden goat.
[30:21.470 --> 30:23.810]  Those are the kinds of plants I would choose to reverse.
[30:23.810 --> 30:27.010]  So when you're looking for standards, looking for a metric, looking for something to compare
[30:27.010 --> 30:31.330]  it to, those are the ladies that I would choose that I did choose to reverse.
[30:31.330 --> 30:33.970]  So those are three of my favorite plants that I've ever worked with.
[30:33.970 --> 30:35.750]  Those are my three favorite reversals.
[30:35.750 --> 30:36.750]  There are more coming.
[30:36.750 --> 30:38.810]  I am working on some things I haven't shared with you yet.
[30:39.330 --> 30:43.610]  But so far, the golden goat, the blueberry cookies and the grateful dog have been my
[30:43.610 --> 30:45.530]  three favorite plants to reverse.
[30:45.530 --> 30:46.530]  All right.
[30:46.530 --> 30:50.430]  I think that is all I've got for you in my episode about selecting males and choosing
[30:50.430 --> 30:52.270]  a candidate for reversals.
[30:52.270 --> 30:55.450]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, you know I would love to hear
[30:55.450 --> 30:56.450]  from you.
[30:56.450 --> 31:00.110]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[31:00.110 --> 31:01.110]  Don't be shy.
[31:01.110 --> 31:04.490]  Reach out and look forward to the constructive criticism, the positive feedback or even the
[31:04.490 --> 31:05.490]  hate mail.
[31:05.490 --> 31:07.530]  If that's what you got to do, it doesn't hurt my feelings.
[31:07.530 --> 31:08.530]  Don't be shy.
[31:09.250 --> 31:10.250]  Let me hear it.
[31:10.250 --> 31:14.010]  Also, make sure you support the show on Patreon at patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[31:14.010 --> 31:15.010]  heart.
[31:15.010 --> 31:18.930]  Everybody supporting the show on Patreon did get a coupon code for the Christmas sale.
[31:18.930 --> 31:24.170]  Of course, that code was adjusted based on your Patreon contribution level.
[31:24.170 --> 31:29.530]  The 420 level got one code and of course the 710 and higher got another coupon code.
[31:29.530 --> 31:31.650]  So make sure you support the show on Patreon.
[31:31.650 --> 31:36.530]  If you do want access to the coupon codes, info on the drops, early access to the releases,
[31:36.530 --> 31:41.290]  I do recommend you sign up for the newsletter on the website, iregenetics.com.
[31:41.290 --> 31:44.890]  At the bottom of the page, there's a little tab that says keep in touch or join the newsletter.
[31:44.890 --> 31:46.570]  I don't remember exactly what it says.
[31:46.570 --> 31:48.770]  I don't stalk my own website often enough.
[31:48.770 --> 31:52.610]  But if you go to the bottom, there's a spot you can type in your email address.
[31:52.610 --> 31:53.610]  Type in your email address.
[31:53.610 --> 31:55.450]  That will add you to my newsletter.
[31:55.450 --> 31:59.690]  When I put out new drops, new holiday deals, cool shit that you may want to know about,
[31:59.690 --> 32:02.370]  you will get an update from my MailChimp newsletter.
[32:02.370 --> 32:04.810]  That is at iregenetics.com.
[32:04.810 --> 32:07.210]  Everything you need will be at iregenetics.com.
[32:07.210 --> 32:10.890]  There's a link to the seeds, a link to the merch, a link to the podcast, a link to the
[32:10.890 --> 32:12.810]  Discord, the Patreon.
[32:12.810 --> 32:14.810]  It is all there, iregenetics.com.
[32:14.810 --> 32:18.410]  Well, I feel like I got rambly here at the end of the show.
[32:18.410 --> 32:20.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[32:20.930 --> 32:23.610]  I may be back next week depending on the holiday schedule.
[32:23.610 --> 32:27.250]  Like I said at the top of the show, if I don't pop up for a week, don't worry.
[32:27.250 --> 32:28.250]  Nothing bad happened.
[32:28.250 --> 32:32.690]  I'm catching my breath, enjoying some time with the family and the dogs and the holidays
[32:32.690 --> 32:34.250]  and the snow.
[32:34.250 --> 32:37.770]  I hope you have a great holiday, whichever one it is you choose to celebrate.
[32:37.770 --> 32:40.210]  I'll be back in a week or maybe two weeks.
[32:40.210 --> 32:43.090]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy Billy Podunk.
[32:43.090 --> 32:46.570]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
