[00:12.600 --> 00:21.270]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:21.270 --> 00:25.030]  It's time for episode number 171 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:25.030 --> 00:27.550]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.550 --> 00:28.550]  That's right.
[00:28.550 --> 00:32.190]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:32.190 --> 00:36.310]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:36.310 --> 00:40.790]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.790 --> 00:44.550]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeffo, and thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.550 --> 00:47.790]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:47.790 --> 00:50.510]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:50.510 --> 00:54.230]  Big shout out to Kat, Kud, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.230 --> 00:55.230]  Yeah.
[00:55.230 --> 00:58.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me, the repeat offender, returning champion,
[00:58.950 --> 01:00.430]  ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back.
[01:00.430 --> 01:01.430]  What's up, everybody?
[01:01.430 --> 01:02.430]  Thanks for joining me, bro.
[01:02.430 --> 01:03.430]  Yeah, man.
[01:03.430 --> 01:07.110]  If you guys want to stalk White Mike while you're listening to him, make sure you follow
[01:07.110 --> 01:08.430]  him on Twitter.
[01:08.430 --> 01:10.510]  It's at NemoPunk15.
[01:10.510 --> 01:13.350]  Also remind everybody how they can check out your Facebook group.
[01:13.350 --> 01:15.910]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[01:15.910 --> 01:17.030]  Check us out, folks.
[01:17.030 --> 01:18.750]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[01:18.750 --> 01:20.950]  Mike, I'm going to turn your microphone up for some reason.
[01:20.950 --> 01:21.950]  Do it.
[01:21.950 --> 01:22.950]  Bring me up a little bit.
[01:22.950 --> 01:23.950]  I may be getting a head cold.
[01:23.950 --> 01:24.950]  Something sounds a little muffly.
[01:24.950 --> 01:25.950]  I apologize, listeners, if it's muffly.
[01:25.950 --> 01:26.950]  I hope it's just my head.
[01:26.950 --> 01:28.510]  Is it in your head or is it in the gear?
[01:28.510 --> 01:31.510]  Yeah, I'm thinking it's in the headphones because the music sounds good, but my voice
[01:31.510 --> 01:32.510]  sounds stupid.
[01:32.510 --> 01:33.950]  So it's just my head.
[01:33.950 --> 01:34.950]  I apologize for that, folks.
[01:34.950 --> 01:36.670]  I'm going to get over it and we're going to do a podcast.
[01:36.670 --> 01:37.670]  Thanks for joining me, dude.
[01:37.670 --> 01:38.670]  Yeah, man.
[01:38.670 --> 01:42.750]  Make sure you guys support Mike on the Twitter and follow Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:42.750 --> 01:44.990]  Check out what he's posting there on Facebook.
[01:44.990 --> 01:47.230]  We truly appreciate the cannabis advocates.
[01:47.230 --> 01:49.030]  Dude, did you hear Granny give you a shout out?
[01:49.030 --> 01:50.030]  I did.
[01:50.030 --> 01:51.030]  I did.
[01:51.030 --> 01:52.190]  I appreciate that, Granny.
[01:52.190 --> 01:55.270]  It was fun meeting you the one time we got to meet at Candy Canyon and I can't wait until
[01:55.270 --> 01:56.830]  we run into each other again.
[01:56.830 --> 01:58.750]  I will get you guys here together on this podcast.
[01:58.750 --> 01:59.750]  It'll be a good time.
[01:59.750 --> 02:00.750]  Right.
[02:00.750 --> 02:01.750]  I'll do my best.
[02:01.750 --> 02:02.750]  Sounds good to me.
[02:02.750 --> 02:03.750]  She will get you high as giraffe pussy.
[02:03.750 --> 02:04.750]  Oh, Granny's awesome.
[02:04.750 --> 02:06.990]  This is the basket of magic.
[02:06.990 --> 02:07.990]  The basket, yes.
[02:08.310 --> 02:09.310]  I'm going to put Granny in her basket of magic.
[02:09.310 --> 02:10.310]  Yep.
[02:10.310 --> 02:11.750]  Granny got to meet Action Bronson the other day.
[02:11.750 --> 02:15.110]  That was one of the coolest photos I've ever seen, dabbing Granny in Action Bronson.
[02:15.110 --> 02:17.470]  So shout out to dabbing Granny.
[02:17.470 --> 02:20.110]  Also since we're doing shout outs, I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at
[02:20.110 --> 02:21.110]  Handmade Apparel.
[02:21.110 --> 02:22.110]  That's right.
[02:22.110 --> 02:26.750]  If you guys need any sort of t-shirt printing, some stickers, some hat pins, you guys, I
[02:26.750 --> 02:30.250]  fully endorse and support my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:30.250 --> 02:33.470]  Check out handmadeapparel.biz or check them out on Facebook.
[02:33.470 --> 02:35.590]  There's a Facebook group and a Facebook page.
[02:35.590 --> 02:38.630]  Hey guys, they printed me some Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[02:38.630 --> 02:40.750]  They've printed my iRegenetics t-shirts.
[02:40.750 --> 02:43.350]  I've got a bright red handmade apparel hoodie.
[02:43.350 --> 02:45.550]  I've got a green handmade apparel hoodie.
[02:45.550 --> 02:46.630]  I've got hat pins.
[02:46.630 --> 02:51.350]  I've got stickers that these folks made and everything is top quality.
[02:51.350 --> 02:53.610]  It's made in America by Americans.
[02:53.610 --> 02:55.310]  It's made by dab kids who take dabs.
[02:55.310 --> 02:57.330]  They dab just as hard as you and I do.
[02:57.330 --> 02:58.990]  So I think it's great to support the community.
[02:58.990 --> 03:02.350]  I think it's great to support our friends that are doing this with us.
[03:02.350 --> 03:03.670]  I really like these people.
[03:03.670 --> 03:05.370]  They're good friends of mine and they make great shit.
[03:06.150 --> 03:08.130]  So please support them as much as I do.
[03:08.130 --> 03:09.850]  Handmade for all your printing needs.
[03:09.850 --> 03:13.290]  You can get that sweet handmade apparel logo on the side of your shirt like I've got.
[03:13.290 --> 03:14.930]  We could all be in the same handmade gang.
[03:14.930 --> 03:15.930]  It's pretty awesome.
[03:15.930 --> 03:18.370]  Big shout out to the Handmade crew.
[03:18.370 --> 03:21.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, go to handmadeapparel.biz and check them out.
[03:21.050 --> 03:22.090]  Get some stuff printed.
[03:22.090 --> 03:24.890]  I'm a big fan of the quality.
[03:24.890 --> 03:30.650]  Typically shirts that are printed with logos and stuff, the logo goes first.
[03:30.650 --> 03:34.290]  All of my handmade stuff, the shirt is going a little before the logo.
[03:34.290 --> 03:35.690]  The logo still looks fresh.
[03:35.690 --> 03:39.170]  You know, I wear, if you know me, I'm kind of a cartoon character is what they call me.
[03:39.170 --> 03:42.650]  I've got a hoodie with the IRIE Genetics logo and I take off my hoodie and underneath that
[03:42.650 --> 03:43.650]  is an IRIE Genetics t-shirt.
[03:43.650 --> 03:46.210]  Right, it's the exact same logo in a different shirt.
[03:46.210 --> 03:49.890]  I've been wearing probably, I have not thrown any of them away.
[03:49.890 --> 03:54.210]  I've been rocking these t-shirts for probably five years now and from the first one, I have
[03:54.210 --> 03:55.210]  not thrown it away.
[03:55.210 --> 03:56.330]  The logo is still crispy.
[03:56.330 --> 04:00.490]  The shirt, however, is getting that black shirt dinge to it, but the logo looks like
[04:00.490 --> 04:01.490]  it was freshly painted.
[04:01.490 --> 04:02.490]  It looks sweet.
[04:02.490 --> 04:04.210]  I mean, it can only hold up for so long.
[04:04.250 --> 04:08.610]  I mean, I've beaten the living hell out of mine and the logo still looks fresh.
[04:08.610 --> 04:09.610]  They're sweet shirts.
[04:09.610 --> 04:11.050]  So I think we've given them a huge shout out.
[04:11.050 --> 04:13.770]  Big thanks to my friends at Handmade Apparel for all the stuff they've printed.
[04:13.770 --> 04:16.290]  You guys, they have the best rates for hat pins.
[04:16.290 --> 04:18.690]  If you're getting your hat pins made, go through Handmade Apparel.
[04:18.690 --> 04:20.290]  I went through, I tried a lot of companies.
[04:20.290 --> 04:22.010]  Handmade Apparel was the most reliable.
[04:22.010 --> 04:26.370]  They do the artwork in-house and they have the pins made so it's all one group so you
[04:26.370 --> 04:29.050]  don't have to have different people working together and fucking you up.
[04:29.050 --> 04:30.610]  They do great artwork.
[04:30.610 --> 04:31.610]  I love those guys.
[04:31.610 --> 04:32.610]  So shout out.
[04:32.610 --> 04:33.610]  Much respect.
[04:33.930 --> 04:35.810]  All that stuff to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[04:35.810 --> 04:36.810]  Make sure you check them out.
[04:36.810 --> 04:37.810]  HandmadeApparel.biz.
[04:37.810 --> 04:38.810]  I think I've said that enough times.
[04:38.810 --> 04:42.210]  What else do you want to chatter about before we get into our main topic, Mike, or do you
[04:42.210 --> 04:43.770]  want to jump into the-
[04:43.770 --> 04:49.890]  It's, uh, it feels like so much has happened since the last time I was on here.
[04:49.890 --> 04:51.450]  Lots of stuff's happened since the election.
[04:51.450 --> 04:53.270]  We should probably just dive right into the show.
[04:53.270 --> 04:56.710]  Let's go to, yeah, let's start off with the letter from the DEA that came out just a couple
[04:56.710 --> 05:00.450]  of days ago and then we will do, if we have time for it, we will do a couple of election
[05:00.450 --> 05:02.410]  updates because I know you love getting to that.
[05:02.410 --> 05:04.330]  A lot of listeners have asked for longer lessons.
[05:04.330 --> 05:05.330]  That was me clapping.
[05:05.330 --> 05:06.330]  I don't clap like that.
[05:06.330 --> 05:07.330]  Why did I do that?
[05:07.330 --> 05:10.530]  Yeah, listeners, a lot of listeners are like, hey bro, I want a longer episode.
[05:10.530 --> 05:11.970]  You guys, I've taken on a new project.
[05:11.970 --> 05:13.970]  I don't talk a lot about this project that I'm doing.
[05:13.970 --> 05:19.610]  I've kind of kept it on the down low, but it keeps me busy for 45 or 50 hours a week.
[05:19.610 --> 05:21.610]  So I haven't been doing two podcast episodes.
[05:21.610 --> 05:22.610]  I apologize.
[05:22.610 --> 05:26.530]  I'm going to do my best to get longer episodes and I know that the past couple episodes have
[05:26.530 --> 05:28.690]  been a little not as informative.
[05:28.690 --> 05:30.410]  I was over fucking whelmed, you guys.
[05:30.410 --> 05:31.410]  It's the holiday season.
[05:31.410 --> 05:33.810]  It's everybody's super busy right now.
[05:33.810 --> 05:34.810]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:34.810 --> 05:37.410]  I've got, I've got a kiddo, I've got friends, I'm doing a new project.
[05:37.410 --> 05:40.410]  It was hanging out with my mom earlier today for quite some time talking about Christmas
[05:40.410 --> 05:41.410]  presents and stuff.
[05:41.410 --> 05:42.410]  I don't feel good.
[05:42.410 --> 05:45.410]  So you just wrapped a killer outdoor grove session again.
[05:45.410 --> 05:46.410]  Yeah, that's true.
[05:46.410 --> 05:49.450]  Big shout out to Jesse for coming and helping us do some outdoor grow lessons.
[05:49.450 --> 05:52.050]  So I love those series or that series every year.
[05:52.050 --> 05:54.810]  I feel like I got to pack so much info into every single episode though.
[05:54.810 --> 05:58.410]  So when I don't give a full informative episode, I feel like I'm kind of cheating myself and
[05:58.410 --> 05:59.410]  the listeners.
[05:59.410 --> 06:04.090]  There are episodes where I've had to stop and pause repeatedly while I take notes.
[06:04.090 --> 06:05.530]  They're so hyper detailed.
[06:05.530 --> 06:06.530]  It's fantastic.
[06:06.530 --> 06:10.610]  I've got, and I know I keep saying it, I've got those podcasts in the works.
[06:10.610 --> 06:12.450]  The ones where you're going to have, I've got the folder right here in my hand.
[06:12.450 --> 06:13.450]  You can hear this.
[06:13.450 --> 06:14.450]  This is all those pages.
[06:14.450 --> 06:15.450]  It's more impressive every week.
[06:15.450 --> 06:16.450]  Yeah.
[06:16.450 --> 06:17.450]  I'm going to do those.
[06:17.450 --> 06:18.790]  I'm just, I'm trying to perfect them.
[06:18.790 --> 06:22.050]  Those are episodes that are going to be in depth and I'm kind of a perfectionist.
[06:22.050 --> 06:24.430]  So when they come out like that, they're really good.
[06:24.430 --> 06:27.810]  But this episode we're going to talk about, you like how I pulled that background?
[06:27.810 --> 06:29.370]  I've been podcasting a while.
[06:29.370 --> 06:33.250]  So this podcast, we're going to talk about a letter that the DEA sent.
[06:33.250 --> 06:34.250]  Who the hell did they send it to?
[06:34.250 --> 06:38.170]  Did they just publish it or was it actually mailed to people?
[06:38.170 --> 06:40.370]  This was the big dust up this week.
[06:40.370 --> 06:45.770]  The letter that everyone freaked out about over CBD.
[06:45.770 --> 06:48.250]  Did your face just break?
[06:48.250 --> 06:53.610]  This story almost broke me.
[06:53.610 --> 06:59.290]  The big dust up is basically saying the DEA just made CBD illegal again.
[07:00.210 --> 07:01.210]  It was never legal.
[07:01.210 --> 07:02.210]  Right.
[07:02.210 --> 07:03.210]  We're going to get to that.
[07:03.210 --> 07:06.330]  Let me read this news article and then we're definitely going to talk about why it's silly
[07:06.330 --> 07:08.690]  and we'll talk about a lot of details.
[07:08.690 --> 07:11.450]  There are a lot of different versions of this article.
[07:11.450 --> 07:14.330]  The main part that I want to focus on is a quote.
[07:14.330 --> 07:18.970]  This story is a great example of just how fake news can be.
[07:18.970 --> 07:19.970]  Right.
[07:19.970 --> 07:23.210]  In the different degrees of bullshit that can work their way into a press story.
[07:23.210 --> 07:26.730]  I've read it in three or four different locations and the part I want to focus on is mainly
[07:26.730 --> 07:29.090]  quoted from the DEA themselves.
[07:29.890 --> 07:34.010]  The buffers around it, we can talk shit about a blot on every website.
[07:34.010 --> 07:37.490]  This one, I chose the one, the Leafly article looked like a crock of shit to me.
[07:37.490 --> 07:39.490]  I didn't like the Leafly article.
[07:39.490 --> 07:43.130]  I chose to go with the article from the Green Rush Daily.
[07:43.130 --> 07:45.150]  Shout out to the Green Rush Daily.
[07:45.150 --> 07:48.410]  The headline is, the DEA just banned CBD and here's why.
[07:48.410 --> 07:52.370]  Then there's a giant ad and then I finally scroll like seven scrolls and I get to the
[07:52.370 --> 07:56.450]  article that says, the legality of CBD is no longer in the gray area.
[07:56.450 --> 08:03.210]  In fact, the DEA just banned CBD, cementing its place in the list of schedule one substances.
[08:03.210 --> 08:09.970]  CBD or cannabidiol is a compound or cannabinoid in cannabis that won't get you high.
[08:09.970 --> 08:15.410]  What it does do though is stop seizures and aid in suffering from dilip, Jesus.
[08:15.410 --> 08:19.810]  I'm the one that wanted to talk shit about an article and I can't speak English words.
[08:19.810 --> 08:21.090]  Debilitating is the word I was trying to say.
[08:21.090 --> 08:25.610]  I nailed cannabinoid and cannabidiol, but I can't say debilitating you guys.
[08:25.770 --> 08:27.770]  It's a mouthful, especially on a phone.
[08:27.770 --> 08:30.170]  Yeah, especially after all those dabs.
[08:30.170 --> 08:31.890]  The dabs never help with reading aloud.
[08:31.890 --> 08:32.890]  That's true.
[08:32.890 --> 08:37.130]  Um, I may be the exception to that rule.
[08:37.130 --> 08:40.530]  I'm an introvert and then sometimes when I smoke a lot of dabs I get chatty and I want
[08:40.530 --> 08:41.530]  to go for that.
[08:41.530 --> 08:42.530]  Oh, it definitely can help with anxiety for sure.
[08:42.530 --> 08:43.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:43.530 --> 08:44.530]  Okay, so we'll keep going.
[08:44.530 --> 08:45.930]  It says, so why is the DEA putting it on?
[08:45.930 --> 08:49.590]  Why is the DEA putting it on the list of the most harmful drugs available to man?
[08:49.590 --> 08:53.090]  Probably the same reasons they temporarily banned the herbal pain reliever Kratom earlier
[08:53.090 --> 08:54.090]  this year.
[08:54.090 --> 08:57.530]  They're both alternatives to more dangerous prescription opiates that are plaguing the
[08:57.530 --> 08:58.530]  country.
[08:58.530 --> 09:04.250]  The DEA actions seem to protect big pharma's pockets more than the health of American citizens.
[09:04.250 --> 09:05.530]  That's not the point that I wanted to get to.
[09:05.530 --> 09:07.690]  They're talking about a conspiracy that I agree with.
[09:07.690 --> 09:11.050]  It was, they were doing so well and then they went off into fucktard land.
[09:11.050 --> 09:12.050]  Yes, yes.
[09:12.050 --> 09:13.050]  Well, just that quick.
[09:13.050 --> 09:15.890]  Well, fucktard land was somewhere I wanted to venture into later in the episode.
[09:15.890 --> 09:20.170]  I didn't want to jump right into Tarkville because I think that may have something to
[09:20.170 --> 09:21.170]  do with it.
[09:21.170 --> 09:23.610]  They see that there are pharmaceutical companies working with it.
[09:24.130 --> 09:25.690]  They don't want us having that market.
[09:25.690 --> 09:27.210]  They want to corner that before we do.
[09:27.210 --> 09:28.570]  So they're just going to shut us down.
[09:28.570 --> 09:29.730]  Like, Oh no, you can't even play.
[09:29.730 --> 09:30.730]  So now we win.
[09:30.730 --> 09:33.530]  Uh, they just landed on free parking by fucking us.
[09:33.530 --> 09:35.290]  But um, I want to keep going.
[09:35.290 --> 09:38.730]  The archaic spelling of the word marijuana with an H is used in the text and federal
[09:38.730 --> 09:43.210]  and the federal register announcing the rule probably to avoid turning up in marijuana
[09:43.210 --> 09:44.410]  related search results.
[09:44.410 --> 09:45.970]  Oh wow.
[09:45.970 --> 09:46.970]  Is that true?
[09:46.970 --> 09:49.890]  They think that no, it's just how the fucking feds spell it.
[09:49.890 --> 09:50.890]  You fucking conspiracy.
[09:51.170 --> 09:52.170]  Fuck.
[09:52.170 --> 09:57.450]  As soon as you said green rush daily, I was like, Oh fuck.
[09:57.450 --> 09:59.730]  And then you said you should have been at the top and I went off.
[09:59.730 --> 10:00.730]  You should have warned me cause yeah.
[10:00.730 --> 10:06.450]  And I knew where this was going, but I think this will be helpful for our listeners because
[10:06.450 --> 10:11.370]  I thought it was two ways to spot marijuana with an H. Yeah, it's the, that's just how
[10:11.370 --> 10:13.250]  the feds spell marijuana.
[10:13.250 --> 10:19.130]  The um, and this is where, what a lot of the fake news is oriented around.
[10:19.170 --> 10:24.650]  Um, basically everybody has heard of CBD by now.
[10:24.650 --> 10:28.730]  Coast to coast is CBDs a household term.
[10:28.730 --> 10:34.570]  Now, uh, people have seen through Sanjay Gupta specials and through YouTube videos and Facebook
[10:34.570 --> 10:40.810]  posts, how helpful it can be with Parkinson's, uh, with seizure disorders, with the face
[10:40.810 --> 10:50.290]  syndrome, uh, with pain management, um, with, uh, the change in a federal policy with the
[10:50.290 --> 10:55.690]  Ogden memo and the coal memo that led to, um, marijuana markets like we have here in
[10:55.690 --> 10:58.130]  Colorado where they're legal.
[10:58.130 --> 11:02.650]  Um, some of those like Colorado's included legal hemp.
[11:02.650 --> 11:07.650]  And so last year, the year before the feds, um, just like the colon, Ogden memos did for
[11:07.850 --> 11:09.850]  high THC cannabis.
[11:09.850 --> 11:15.250]  Um, they put out a little blurb in the farm bill covering industrial hemp and putting,
[11:15.250 --> 11:19.130]  um, a definition for what industrial hemp is.
[11:19.130 --> 11:25.970]  And so under the guise of that legal loophole, a number of companies, both domestic and foreign
[11:25.970 --> 11:32.890]  started selling TVs or CBD extract online, um, in all 50 States, making it available
[11:32.890 --> 11:34.650]  pretty much everywhere.
[11:34.650 --> 11:38.090]  Companies like CBD, Lifewater have sprung up that are trying to get distribution in
[11:38.090 --> 11:40.090]  all 50 States.
[11:40.090 --> 11:44.370]  Um, and it's under a gray market loophole created by the farm bill.
[11:44.370 --> 11:45.770]  It is in no way legal.
[11:45.770 --> 11:49.410]  Um, the feds have always considered every part of the cannabis plant.
[11:49.410 --> 11:53.210]  It doesn't matter if it's sativa, Indica, hemp, root, Rallis, they don't give a shit.
[11:53.210 --> 11:55.890]  Let me jump in right there because that's right where I am in this article.
[11:55.890 --> 11:56.890]  Yep.
[11:56.890 --> 11:59.090]  And they spell it marijuana with an H why?
[11:59.090 --> 12:03.330]  Because these laws are based in fucking racism.
[12:03.330 --> 12:07.910]  And that was a lot of where the original basis for these comes from.
[12:07.910 --> 12:12.010]  So when the feds write a new marijuana law, it's on the backs of all the old marijuana
[12:12.010 --> 12:15.570]  laws and they keep the same racist ass spelling.
[12:15.570 --> 12:17.890]  All right.
[12:17.890 --> 12:20.010]  Just giving me a look like I know, but let me finish the article.
[12:20.010 --> 12:22.930]  Yeah, no, no, you're fired up and I like it, but I want, I have to get through this article
[12:22.930 --> 12:25.010]  to make the show a show.
[12:25.010 --> 12:29.130]  It says the reason, uh, given that the U S is complying with the international drug
[12:29.130 --> 12:32.290]  control treaties, uh, wait, the reason giving is that the, okay.
[12:32.290 --> 12:33.290]  It says that they are
[12:33.290 --> 12:39.790]  so the DEA stated reason for the change this week is to help them comply with international
[12:39.790 --> 12:40.790]  narcotics treaties.
[12:40.790 --> 12:44.690]  Then they say before this elaboration, CBD is legality was in a gray area.
[12:44.690 --> 12:49.130]  It was assumed that CBD extracted from medical cannabis was only legal for medical marijuana
[12:49.130 --> 12:51.170]  patients and illegal to the rest.
[12:51.170 --> 12:56.370]  However, CBD derived from industrial hemp was being sold across the country as if it
[12:56.370 --> 12:58.210]  were federally federally legal.
[12:58.210 --> 13:03.370]  Well, apparently the DEA has always believed any form of cannabis extract to be schedule
[13:03.370 --> 13:04.370]  one.
[13:04.370 --> 13:05.370]  Okay.
[13:05.370 --> 13:09.250]  Now I want to, if I handed you a CBD molecule, a scientist, a CBD molecule, and I said, did
[13:09.250 --> 13:11.330]  this come from hemp or cannabis?
[13:11.330 --> 13:12.690]  He'd probably tell me to go fuck myself.
[13:12.690 --> 13:13.690]  Cause it's the same thing.
[13:13.690 --> 13:16.090]  He would say it's a molecule.
[13:16.090 --> 13:20.330]  So the DEA claims that there are small amounts of cannabinoids in every CBD extract.
[13:20.490 --> 13:25.130]  They cite this as another reason to keep CBD on schedule one for practical purposes, all
[13:25.130 --> 13:30.410]  extracts that contain CBD will also contain at least a small amount of other cannabinoids.
[13:30.410 --> 13:36.450]  However, if it were possible to produce the form of cannabis plant, sorry, they wrote
[13:36.450 --> 13:37.570]  this weird and there's an ad right here.
[13:37.570 --> 13:38.570]  I'm skipping through it.
[13:38.570 --> 13:42.330]  Uh, let's see, uh, produce from the cannabis plant extract that contain only CBD and no
[13:42.330 --> 13:47.050]  other cannabinoids, such an extract would fall within the new drug code.
[13:47.050 --> 13:52.610]  So basically the DEA made extracting CBD completely illegal, whether it's from hemp or not, whether
[13:52.610 --> 13:56.010]  it is pure CBD, because they are wrong right there when they say that you can't get pure
[13:56.010 --> 14:01.650]  CBD because I know I'm thinking, counting, I can put five fingers up and confidently
[14:01.650 --> 14:05.930]  say that I know five people that I could call friends that can make CBD isolate.
[14:05.930 --> 14:08.970]  That is 99.8 or 9% CBD.
[14:08.970 --> 14:11.890]  That one or 2% is atmospheric conditions.
[14:11.890 --> 14:14.810]  There are things like oxygen in there that they cannot control.
[14:14.810 --> 14:15.810]  Yeah.
[14:15.850 --> 14:20.890]  It's, it's, you can get a hundred percent pure CBD, um, lots of different places.
[14:20.890 --> 14:25.410]  The, the, the DEA's position on it doesn't have anything to do with there being trace
[14:25.410 --> 14:26.930]  cannabinoids in it.
[14:26.930 --> 14:30.810]  Um, that's just something that happened to mumble during the press conference.
[14:30.810 --> 14:34.970]  So it's always been, but every, it's always been illegal, just like every part of the
[14:34.970 --> 14:37.570]  cannabis plant is illegal federally.
[14:37.570 --> 14:40.170]  Um, the seeds are illegal.
[14:40.170 --> 14:41.490]  The leaves are illegal.
[14:41.490 --> 14:42.970]  The root ball is illegal.
[14:42.970 --> 14:45.530]  The pot you grew it in is illegal.
[14:45.530 --> 14:49.010]  Um, it doesn't matter if it's industrial hemp.
[14:49.010 --> 14:56.290]  Um, every year, um, or I'm just to be safe every 18 months, uh, some drug task force
[14:56.290 --> 15:00.570]  somewhere like East Palm fuck Texas makes the, an announcement that they've just found
[15:00.570 --> 15:02.130]  the world's biggest pot farm.
[15:02.130 --> 15:07.650]  Um, and they're rating it today and they, they didn't catch any growers and it's headline
[15:07.650 --> 15:11.810]  news on Monday and it's headline news on Tuesday.
[15:11.810 --> 15:14.810]  And then there's nothing about it in the press on Wednesday.
[15:14.810 --> 15:20.930]  And next Friday it comes out that it was a wild hemp field on some farmers back 400,
[15:20.930 --> 15:23.570]  400 acres in the middle of nowhere.
[15:23.570 --> 15:29.330]  And it was the weather conditions that spring were perfect for feral hemp to go nuts.
[15:29.330 --> 15:34.370]  Um, and the DEA will spend a hundred thousand dollars ripping all of that feral hemp out
[15:34.370 --> 15:36.050]  of the ground and burning it.
[15:36.050 --> 15:38.650]  Um, because it's the dangerous marijuana plant.
[15:38.650 --> 15:40.090]  It doesn't matter that it's growing wild.
[15:40.090 --> 15:41.090]  It doesn't have any.
[15:41.370 --> 15:45.290]  If you smoked any of that stuff, if you harvested, dried and cured it properly, all that shit
[15:45.290 --> 15:47.010]  would do is give you a headache.
[15:47.010 --> 15:49.290]  There's a, an Indian reservation.
[15:49.290 --> 15:54.890]  Um, I want to say it was in New Mexico, um, somewhere hot and kind of miserable to live.
[15:54.890 --> 15:58.490]  Um, where feral hemp was just everywhere.
[15:58.490 --> 15:59.810]  They couldn't do anything about it.
[15:59.810 --> 16:00.810]  It was an issue.
[16:00.810 --> 16:06.010]  Um, and they'd found a way to basically build whole houses with it, with hemp creating a
[16:06.010 --> 16:09.130]  couple of other products and they were doing it all on site.
[16:09.170 --> 16:15.050]  Um, and the feds would show up every now and again and burn their hemp down, um, because
[16:15.050 --> 16:16.370]  it's dangerous hemp.
[16:16.370 --> 16:18.770]  Um, and this happens all over the country.
[16:18.770 --> 16:23.650]  The DEA wastes small fortunes, ripping wild hemp plants out of the ground that are left
[16:23.650 --> 16:28.210]  over from the thirties and forties when hemp was grown as a crop all over the U S when
[16:28.210 --> 16:33.610]  there's a terrible heroin epidemic everywhere right now, like Colorado Springs is littered
[16:33.610 --> 16:34.850]  with crystal meth.
[16:34.850 --> 16:36.210]  Meth is everywhere in Springs.
[16:36.210 --> 16:39.730]  People driving around on bicycles, looking at fucking trash cans all over Colorado Springs,
[16:39.730 --> 16:41.770]  Pueblo, Pueblo is dead.
[16:41.770 --> 16:42.770]  It's Friday night right now.
[16:42.770 --> 16:44.170]  You guys, it's Friday night at 10 30.
[16:44.170 --> 16:45.170]  It's fucking quiet.
[16:45.170 --> 16:48.090]  All the people that used to be out raging doing heroin, not all, but I mean a good fucking
[16:48.090 --> 16:51.170]  portion of our young people are out doing heroin right now.
[16:51.170 --> 16:54.370]  And the DEA is worried about fucking with plants that keep us cold.
[16:54.370 --> 17:02.610]  I mean, not even cannabis or fun cannabis that gets you stoned and their hemp, the stuff
[17:02.610 --> 17:09.450]  you make jeans with, um, houses, bricks, textiles, necklaces, right?
[17:09.450 --> 17:13.610]  There's an infinite number of products you can make with, with hemp.
[17:13.610 --> 17:18.130]  And that was part of the, the reason they, they included the exemption, um, in the farm
[17:18.130 --> 17:23.970]  bill last year, the year before to, um, to designate what exactly is industrial hemp.
[17:23.970 --> 17:29.450]  Um, because everybody, I mean, everybody, everybody understands how absurd our, our
[17:29.450 --> 17:30.930]  hemp laws are.
[17:30.930 --> 17:36.010]  Um, but as far as law enforcement's concerned, cops can't tell the difference between hemp
[17:36.010 --> 17:39.770]  and weed and they're pretty sure you can grow the two next to each other.
[17:39.770 --> 17:45.050]  So you could hide your high THC plants and among your hemp plants, which anyone that's
[17:45.050 --> 17:48.350]  ever grown either crop knows how insane that is.
[17:48.350 --> 17:53.290]  But law enforcement across the country still argue shit like that in federal court to keep
[17:53.290 --> 17:56.210]  the DEA making decisions like this.
[17:56.210 --> 18:01.610]  Sunsol is growing a bunch of, uh, it's all CBD plants and it looks like killer cannabis
[18:01.610 --> 18:02.610]  plants.
[18:02.610 --> 18:05.770]  If they told me that that was white widow or something, I honestly couldn't tell the
[18:05.770 --> 18:06.930]  difference on their plants.
[18:06.930 --> 18:09.810]  They have got very cannabis looking.
[18:09.810 --> 18:11.490]  Some of them can be very, very similar.
[18:11.490 --> 18:14.730]  It depends what the hemp you're growing has been bred to do.
[18:14.730 --> 18:15.730]  Yeah.
[18:15.730 --> 18:16.730]  Yeah.
[18:16.730 --> 18:21.490]  Um, and if I understand what Sunsol is doing is they're producing, um, CBD extract.
[18:21.490 --> 18:22.650]  It looks like flow.
[18:22.650 --> 18:24.730]  It grows just like flow.
[18:24.730 --> 18:29.050]  That's the type of hemp you would want for a high CBD extract production.
[18:29.050 --> 18:33.930]  But that I'm guessing that hemp strain would be crap if they tried to make fuel oil or
[18:33.930 --> 18:34.930]  fiber.
[18:34.930 --> 18:35.930]  It's not fibrous.
[18:35.930 --> 18:39.690]  Um, I mean, and that's one of the great things about cannabis is it can be bred one way or
[18:39.690 --> 18:43.850]  the other to achieve an infinite number of final products.
[18:43.850 --> 18:48.170]  Um, but as far as the feds are concerned, every single part of it's illegal.
[18:48.170 --> 18:54.650]  The only legal hemp, um, or marijuana products that are federally legal in the United States
[18:54.650 --> 18:59.370]  are hemp clothing produced in other countries or produced from fabric that was grown in
[18:59.370 --> 19:04.090]  other countries and silly low and hemp seed oil, lotion, stuff like that.
[19:04.090 --> 19:10.130]  I mean, products that were produced with plant material grown in other countries.
[19:10.130 --> 19:14.290]  Um, everything else is at least a gray market.
[19:14.530 --> 19:20.730]  Um, the FDA and a couple other, um, national safety organizations released the thing.
[19:20.730 --> 19:26.570]  We even did a blurb about it on the show about the foreign companies selling, God knows what
[19:26.570 --> 19:29.170]  is CBD extract or CBD product.
[19:29.170 --> 19:30.170]  Random shit in there.
[19:30.170 --> 19:31.170]  Yep.
[19:31.170 --> 19:33.730]  They were testing it and it didn't have a lot of CBD in it.
[19:33.730 --> 19:36.370]  Um, or maybe it did, but it had a lot of other crap in it.
[19:36.370 --> 19:40.490]  You didn't want to, uh, along with it is filler.
[19:40.490 --> 19:43.810]  Um, that's what you get in a gray market.
[19:44.330 --> 19:47.490]  You get a lot of knockoff products, you get a lot of mislabeled products.
[19:47.490 --> 19:52.050]  Um, and this is why I've been freaking out about getting people politically active.
[19:52.050 --> 19:54.770]  Do you think they're doing this for their own financial gain?
[19:54.770 --> 19:58.650]  Do you think the pharmaceutical companies are planning something with CBD products?
[19:58.650 --> 20:03.050]  Um, there's a couple in great Britain and around the country that are already working
[20:03.050 --> 20:06.410]  with, um, THC CBD products.
[20:06.410 --> 20:11.250]  Um, GW pharmaceuticals is working a couple of different product lines.
[20:11.570 --> 20:14.450]  Um, but there's still five, 10 years from market.
[20:14.450 --> 20:15.450]  Okay.
[20:15.450 --> 20:23.210]  Um, I'm sure that the pharmaceutical industry don't, don't want, um, THC and see, like they
[20:23.210 --> 20:29.650]  would prefer to, as an industry, I'm sure they would prefer to have, um, control of
[20:29.650 --> 20:32.930]  all medications that people take.
[20:32.930 --> 20:35.170]  But that's not physically possible.
[20:35.170 --> 20:36.210]  They don't want to make me better.
[20:36.210 --> 20:40.130]  They want to mask my symptoms and keep feeding me a pill to make me a customer.
[20:40.130 --> 20:45.050]  And greed is like the one conspiracy theory you're going to get me to buy into anywhere.
[20:45.050 --> 20:48.730]  But with a decision like this, this is just business as usual.
[20:48.730 --> 20:50.290]  This is the exact same.
[20:50.290 --> 20:55.370]  I mean, this has been true since 1940 and people are freaking out about this decision
[20:55.370 --> 20:57.010]  today because they issued it.
[20:57.010 --> 21:01.050]  It's a own serial number so they can track the Caesars separately.
[21:01.050 --> 21:06.930]  Um, and I mean, I encourage the move because tracking shit separately is helpful.
[21:07.250 --> 21:12.850]  Um, right now, any anti-marijuana group is going to tell you that 10 years ago, 15 years
[21:12.850 --> 21:18.930]  ago, the average THC content in marijuana was one to 3% and they can back that up with
[21:18.930 --> 21:21.730]  DEA seizure numbers.
[21:21.730 --> 21:26.450]  And the reason that's true is because they've been seizing fields of fucking barrel hemp
[21:26.450 --> 21:29.210]  every year for decades.
[21:29.210 --> 21:34.850]  Um, and, uh, I mean, it's always been illegal.
[21:34.850 --> 21:36.550]  This is nothing new.
[21:36.670 --> 21:40.910]  Tracking it separately helps us figure out, okay, exactly how much did they waste ripping
[21:40.910 --> 21:42.510]  up hemp out of the ground?
[21:42.510 --> 21:47.270]  Um, how much money did they waste making sure Kansas didn't get their hemp seed last year?
[21:47.270 --> 21:51.510]  Um, how much money did they waste rounding up hemp seed off the internet or hemp oil
[21:51.510 --> 21:52.510]  off the internet?
[21:52.510 --> 21:53.510]  Yeah.
[21:53.510 --> 21:54.510]  Off the side of the highway as you drive to New Mexico.
[21:54.510 --> 21:55.510]  I mean, it's nuts.
[21:55.510 --> 21:56.510]  There are.
[21:56.510 --> 22:02.430]  Now, how many people since they've got these companies that are shipping CBD, uh, they're
[22:02.430 --> 22:05.510]  going to have to like the people there's a company.
[22:05.510 --> 22:06.790]  I don't know if I want to say anybody's names.
[22:06.790 --> 22:09.350]  I don't want to get any people in trouble, but I know people personally, and there are
[22:09.350 --> 22:12.550]  companies in Colorado that will ship CBD products nationwide.
[22:12.550 --> 22:17.110]  You can be in Maine, you can be in California and they will send you a bottle of CBD tincture.
[22:17.110 --> 22:21.910]  Uh, how are those people that were relying on those medicine?
[22:21.910 --> 22:23.310]  What are they going to do now?
[22:23.310 --> 22:25.030]  That's who I'm mainly worried about.
[22:25.030 --> 22:26.030]  They're screwed.
[22:26.030 --> 22:27.030]  Yeah.
[22:27.030 --> 22:32.790]  Um, but they were always like their access was only obtained through a gray market.
[22:32.790 --> 22:34.670]  And if they were paying attention, they knew that.
[22:34.670 --> 22:41.030]  And they've been lobbying for a different way to access, uh, whatever product they desperately
[22:41.030 --> 22:43.070]  need in their area.
[22:43.070 --> 22:47.590]  Um, I would love to say, come to Colorado and we've got CBD for you, but there is a
[22:47.590 --> 22:49.310]  CBD drought.
[22:49.310 --> 22:53.190]  The only way like everybody thinks they're going to come to Colorado and go to a medical
[22:53.190 --> 22:56.010]  dispensary and get Heidi CBD medicine.
[22:56.010 --> 22:57.350]  And they are highly disappointed.
[22:57.350 --> 22:58.350]  There is not much.
[22:58.350 --> 23:04.390]  There's not much in what's available is expensive because it's, it's, uh, there's a shortage
[23:04.390 --> 23:06.310]  and there's been a shortage for a while.
[23:06.310 --> 23:10.190]  You've got to find yourself a private caregiver who they're trying to squeeze out of the system
[23:10.190 --> 23:12.070]  now anyway, or you've got to grow it yourself.
[23:12.070 --> 23:15.510]  And then you've got to find a CBD clone or you've got to find seeds of something high
[23:15.510 --> 23:19.030]  CBD and then you've got to grow it and then you've got to get it tested.
[23:19.030 --> 23:23.310]  Or I don't know, people focus a little bit too much on testing when it comes to personal
[23:23.310 --> 23:24.310]  medicine.
[23:24.310 --> 23:25.310]  I think I'm going to do an episode on this.
[23:25.310 --> 23:26.310]  I'm going to write this down.
[23:26.310 --> 23:30.310]  I think that the medicine, I think if medicine works for you, it works for you.
[23:30.310 --> 23:31.510]  Don't pay attention to the lab testing.
[23:31.510 --> 23:34.950]  And there's a lot of elaboration I want to do on that, but we'll save it for another.
[23:34.950 --> 23:38.030]  There's a lot of stuff that lab testing brought to the community.
[23:38.030 --> 23:41.270]  That's just bizarre.
[23:41.270 --> 23:42.990]  People focus on all the wrong numbers.
[23:42.990 --> 23:50.870]  And that's, I mean, I loved watching the CBD industry explode over the last two years.
[23:51.590 --> 23:56.470]  Don't take that from what I'm saying, because I think that should be available to everyone
[23:56.470 --> 23:57.470]  everywhere.
[23:57.470 --> 24:02.110]  I think the society would be a lot better if more people were adding CBD to their diets
[24:02.110 --> 24:04.710]  regularly as a supplement.
[24:04.710 --> 24:06.270]  It helps with a bunch of stuff.
[24:06.270 --> 24:07.710]  I'm a huge CBD advocate.
[24:07.710 --> 24:08.710]  I use it daily.
[24:08.710 --> 24:10.910]  What's your daily dose of CBD?
[24:10.910 --> 24:17.230]  Right now I'm restricting myself because the product I'm using, I'm limited on accessing
[24:17.230 --> 24:18.750]  any more of it ever.
[24:18.750 --> 24:20.830]  That won't happen.
[24:20.830 --> 24:21.830]  It's gone.
[24:21.830 --> 24:22.830]  The person that's making it is gone.
[24:22.830 --> 24:24.950]  And so I'm kind of making it last.
[24:24.950 --> 24:27.350]  That's always the worst part about these products.
[24:27.350 --> 24:28.350]  Yep.
[24:28.350 --> 24:33.950]  And right now I'm at two or three CBD dabs a day.
[24:33.950 --> 24:35.390]  And I space them throughout the day.
[24:35.390 --> 24:38.310]  And it depends if I'm not hurting that day, maybe I'll only take one.
[24:38.310 --> 24:41.870]  Maybe I'll take just a little itty bitty one.
[24:41.870 --> 24:46.230]  Maybe I'll just use some of the pain cream I've got left instead.
[24:46.230 --> 24:48.430]  But that's on purpose.
[24:48.430 --> 24:51.230]  I'm purposely going slow.
[24:51.230 --> 24:57.030]  Before then, or like when I was taking it as a milligram pills, it was 50 milligrams
[24:57.030 --> 24:58.030]  a day.
[24:58.030 --> 24:59.030]  Do you take that all at-
[24:59.030 --> 25:01.030]  25 in the morning, 25 at night.
[25:01.030 --> 25:02.030]  That was my next question.
[25:02.030 --> 25:03.030]  Okay.
[25:03.030 --> 25:04.030]  25.
[25:04.030 --> 25:06.870]  So 25 to keep you pain free at day, 25 to get you sleeping through the night comfortably.
[25:06.870 --> 25:11.270]  We'll just make it easy because I never kind of went wild with it.
[25:11.270 --> 25:14.070]  Because I like it half and half THC, CBD.
[25:14.070 --> 25:19.910]  And I didn't want to be eating 50 milligrams of THC before I went out and did my day.
[25:19.910 --> 25:25.430]  So I was keeping it to 25 and then adding more during the day if I needed to.
[25:25.430 --> 25:28.630]  But I can consume huge amounts of CBD when I'm hurting.
[25:28.630 --> 25:33.230]  I've got an issue with two of the vertebrae in my back.
[25:33.230 --> 25:36.750]  It doesn't happen often, but every now and then they twang off each other, kind of like
[25:36.750 --> 25:38.350]  a rubber band.
[25:38.350 --> 25:41.150]  And that feeling is pretty excruciating.
[25:41.230 --> 25:48.790]  And then the area around where those two twang will get inflamed and hurt for several days
[25:48.790 --> 25:52.030]  to a degree where I can't really bend or work.
[25:52.030 --> 25:57.230]  And if I feel it's twang and I eat a whole bunch of CBD, like 200, 300 milligrams right
[25:57.230 --> 26:00.870]  away, it won't inflame to the point where I'm down the next day.
[26:00.870 --> 26:01.870]  Yeah.
[26:01.870 --> 26:07.230]  I've heard a lot about if you get on it as soon as you feel it, like as soon as you feel
[26:07.230 --> 26:09.790]  it, get that CBD edible in you.
[26:09.790 --> 26:12.830]  And if you can take a dab because dab is...
[26:12.830 --> 26:14.150]  It's instant absorption.
[26:14.150 --> 26:15.150]  Yeah.
[26:15.150 --> 26:16.150]  A dab is instant effect.
[26:16.150 --> 26:21.110]  Well, not just dabbing, but any inhalation through the lungs that makes it to the bloodstream
[26:21.110 --> 26:22.110]  incredibly quickly.
[26:22.110 --> 26:24.350]  And you'll get relief in seconds.
[26:24.350 --> 26:25.350]  Yep.
[26:25.350 --> 26:26.350]  It's seconds.
[26:26.350 --> 26:31.990]  And if you eat it, you're looking at, I mean, half hour, hour, hour and a half, two hours
[26:31.990 --> 26:36.790]  before you've got full effect of what you've consumed.
[26:36.790 --> 26:41.750]  The effect of what you eat is going to be a little stronger, but that delayed, if you're
[26:41.750 --> 26:45.790]  taking it for pain, you can't wait two hours for your pain to kick in.
[26:45.790 --> 26:48.270]  Right.
[26:48.270 --> 26:52.630]  But CBD was never legal in all 50 states.
[26:52.630 --> 26:54.870]  I like how you looped that.
[26:54.870 --> 26:59.430]  You just called that back like a professional comedian.
[26:59.430 --> 27:03.230]  It was a loophole that everybody was operating under.
[27:03.670 --> 27:10.230]  It was so glaringly obvious a loophole that Chinese companies dove all over it.
[27:10.230 --> 27:14.470]  And obviously that was going to get shut down at some point.
[27:14.470 --> 27:17.190]  And that's not even what this was.
[27:17.190 --> 27:22.550]  This was just the DEA assigning it its own serial number for when they do seizures.
[27:22.550 --> 27:25.550]  They didn't even release a letter saying, we're going to go after the people selling
[27:25.550 --> 27:28.150]  this shit online.
[27:28.150 --> 27:32.870]  It's just a reminder that all parts of the cannabis plant are illegal.
[27:32.870 --> 27:37.790]  Most of our community is still not politically aware, let alone politically active.
[27:37.790 --> 27:38.790]  That's what we're here for.
[27:38.790 --> 27:42.630]  That's why I bring you on, Mike, because you can remind them and you can try to blow up
[27:42.630 --> 27:43.630]  the fucking...
[27:43.630 --> 27:48.990]  Huge segments of the population, not just the marijuana community, got this story wrong.
[27:48.990 --> 27:51.110]  I mean, freaked out about it.
[27:51.110 --> 27:57.550]  And they're tying it to every conspiracy theory there is against marijuana legalization.
[27:57.550 --> 28:02.150]  I read a whole, on a fairly reputable news site.
[28:02.430 --> 28:07.150]  It was an opinion piece that they chose to publish about because they use the marijuana
[28:07.150 --> 28:13.430]  with an H spelling in this, that it was, that was because Trump was elected and racism is
[28:13.430 --> 28:15.390]  now openly accepted.
[28:15.390 --> 28:20.310]  And that this was an indication that the DEA was going to round up the stoners and the
[28:20.310 --> 28:21.310]  Mexicans.
[28:21.310 --> 28:23.070]  And this was published in a...
[28:23.070 --> 28:27.710]  And I'm reading this like, oh Jesus, like we've come so far.
[28:27.710 --> 28:30.750]  We just had a huge night on election night.
[28:30.750 --> 28:33.750]  One on one big in so many places.
[28:33.750 --> 28:40.570]  And the first thing we do to celebrate is give ourselves a black eye and then another
[28:40.570 --> 28:43.750]  and another and another and another and another.
[28:43.750 --> 28:47.910]  I mean, we didn't need a fake news shit storm this week.
[28:47.910 --> 28:54.110]  There's enough real news that we should be focused on.
[28:54.110 --> 29:01.230]  And because so much of our community isn't aware of the legalities nationally for this
[29:01.230 --> 29:05.570]  plant we all love, this story's spread like wildfire.
[29:05.570 --> 29:10.310]  I've seen half a dozen businesses down here post it.
[29:10.310 --> 29:12.230]  And it's like, you're a marijuana store.
[29:12.230 --> 29:16.430]  You should have known this better than anyone.
[29:16.430 --> 29:21.430]  The businesses, the CBD businesses that were sending this shit through the mail, their
[29:21.430 --> 29:26.990]  lawyers should have made this perfectly clear to them that they're operating in a legal
[29:26.990 --> 29:32.150]  gray area through a loophole in a fucking farm bill.
[29:32.150 --> 29:36.070]  And that as far as the feds are concerned, all parts of the cannabis plant are illegal
[29:36.070 --> 29:38.950]  regardless of THC content.
[29:38.950 --> 29:45.030]  It can be just the root ball of a hemp plant that dried up or was harvested two years ago.
[29:45.030 --> 29:46.310]  And it's still illegal.
[29:46.310 --> 29:50.710]  You can still be charged with a federal crime for having it.
[29:50.710 --> 29:51.710]  That's scary.
[29:51.710 --> 29:52.710]  Yep.
[29:52.710 --> 29:54.870]  And that's just the reality of our situation.
[29:54.870 --> 29:58.310]  That's why I have so much respect for even the marijuana business owners.
[29:58.310 --> 30:04.030]  I really hate because they're standing up and risking a lot for us, for everybody.
[30:04.030 --> 30:07.870]  Shout out to everyone in the marijuana industry, working hard every day, getting it going.
[30:07.870 --> 30:08.870]  All right.
[30:08.870 --> 30:10.590]  So we've talked a lot about this DEA letter.
[30:10.590 --> 30:11.590]  It's been a long time.
[30:11.590 --> 30:13.990]  So I hope that clears that up and calms you down.
[30:13.990 --> 30:18.110]  Send your hate mail to Nemobunk15 on Twitter or at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on
[30:18.110 --> 30:19.110]  Facebook.
[30:19.110 --> 30:22.710]  All the positive stuff can grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[30:22.710 --> 30:23.710]  Yep.
[30:23.710 --> 30:24.710]  All right.
[30:24.710 --> 30:26.550]  So thanks for listening to the DEA part.
[30:26.550 --> 30:29.750]  We're going to move on to a little bit of updating stuff of things that we've talked
[30:29.750 --> 30:38.470]  about in the past because on our post-election episode, we mentioned that a...
[30:38.470 --> 30:42.750]  It was the little bit of bad news we had for Pueblo for our election night.
[30:42.750 --> 30:45.550]  It was a election question.
[30:45.550 --> 30:49.790]  Should we allow retail marijuana stores inside Pueblo city limits?
[30:49.790 --> 30:50.790]  What's it called on the ballot?
[30:50.790 --> 30:51.790]  What's that initiative?
[30:51.790 --> 30:52.790]  Is that an initiative?
[30:52.790 --> 30:53.790]  Is that what I voted on?
[30:53.790 --> 30:54.790]  What's the thing I voted on?
[30:54.790 --> 30:55.790]  Initiative, amendment.
[30:55.790 --> 30:56.790]  Initiative was the word I was looking at.
[30:56.790 --> 30:57.790]  I think I was trying to...
[30:57.790 --> 30:58.790]  I honestly don't remember which one this was.
[30:58.790 --> 30:59.790]  Whatever, but there was one that...
[30:59.790 --> 31:03.110]  The ballot question is how I tend to defer to it.
[31:03.110 --> 31:05.870]  We thought it did not pass.
[31:05.870 --> 31:13.190]  When we recorded our post-election show, it was failing by 150 or 200 votes.
[31:13.190 --> 31:17.270]  By the time they got all of the provisional ballots counted and all the ballots that were
[31:17.270 --> 31:23.470]  stuck together and whatnot counted, we won by five or 600 votes.
[31:23.470 --> 31:24.470]  Nice.
[31:24.470 --> 31:30.750]  So we will be able to have recreational cannabis stores within the city limits of Pueblo?
[31:30.750 --> 31:34.190]  December 27th, I believe, the city council...
[31:34.190 --> 31:36.710]  It's the Tuesday after Christmas.
[31:36.710 --> 31:43.310]  City council will be voting on the final rules and regs package for rec shops.
[31:43.310 --> 31:47.110]  I hope they're in a good mood after their Christmas break.
[31:47.110 --> 31:50.110]  I hope they all get what they wanted.
[31:50.110 --> 31:51.110]  I'm hoping so too.
[31:51.110 --> 31:56.350]  Unfortunately, I've been involved with this for a long time, so I know way more about
[31:56.350 --> 31:57.350]  it than I should.
[31:57.350 --> 31:59.990]  Even the people that are working on it right now, I probably know more about it than they
[31:59.990 --> 32:01.510]  do.
[32:01.510 --> 32:07.150]  The ordinance that they're about to vote and probably pass into law was written by
[32:07.150 --> 32:12.590]  a zoning commission that was very dead set against allowing marijuana businesses in the
[32:12.590 --> 32:13.590]  city at all.
[32:13.590 --> 32:22.910]  At a certain point, they discovered that with one or two zoning buffer rules, so 1,000 feet
[32:22.910 --> 32:28.110]  from schools and 300 feet from residences, that they could essentially limit the number
[32:28.230 --> 32:33.390]  of marijuana businesses in the city to about a dozen because that's all the property that's
[32:33.390 --> 32:34.390]  physically available.
[32:34.390 --> 32:35.390]  That makes sense.
[32:35.390 --> 32:36.390]  Yeah.
[32:36.390 --> 32:40.070]  If they include those two buffer zones.
[32:40.070 --> 32:44.370]  To make that even more restrictive, they've decided to limit the total number of stores
[32:44.370 --> 32:51.830]  in the city to eight, four north of the river, four south of the river.
[32:51.830 --> 32:57.350]  The city is preparing for a wave of applications and they've come up with a point system and
[32:57.590 --> 33:02.870]  a timeline for that application process to take place.
[33:02.870 --> 33:06.230]  Hopefully by the end of the year, we've got at least a couple of retail marijuana shops
[33:06.230 --> 33:07.230]  open in Pueblo.
[33:07.230 --> 33:08.230]  That'd be cool.
[33:08.230 --> 33:09.230]  Yeah.
[33:09.230 --> 33:15.870]  I wish the rules that we're about to pass are different or were different, are different,
[33:15.870 --> 33:18.750]  but that's very unlikely.
[33:18.750 --> 33:24.990]  I'm doing what I can to get some of the craziness taken out of them, but there's only so much
[33:24.990 --> 33:27.110]  change that they're willing to make right now.
[33:27.870 --> 33:28.870]  They're catching on.
[33:28.870 --> 33:29.870]  They're kind of slowly evolving.
[33:29.870 --> 33:30.870]  Slowly.
[33:30.870 --> 33:35.750]  This is a very different city council than the one we had a year or two years ago.
[33:35.750 --> 33:41.590]  I mean, this is a process that started four years ago.
[33:41.590 --> 33:46.230]  It's been four full years that the city has been working on this particular set of rules
[33:46.230 --> 33:48.030]  and regs.
[33:48.030 --> 33:49.470]  That's how long I've been working on it.
[33:49.470 --> 33:53.870]  Do you think since we had the first shop, do you think we could get just first in line?
[33:53.870 --> 33:56.870]  Be like, hey, can we be back?
[33:57.630 --> 33:58.630]  Come on.
[33:58.630 --> 33:59.630]  Just play that card.
[33:59.630 --> 34:00.630]  Be like, hey, we was here.
[34:00.630 --> 34:04.630]  Most of that part of the city is blacked out due to schools because the thousand foot from
[34:04.630 --> 34:10.710]  schools rule isn't just classrooms where there are students.
[34:10.710 --> 34:17.390]  If the college owns an empty apartment on whatever street, then there's a thousand foot
[34:17.390 --> 34:20.430]  buffer around that empty apartment.
[34:20.430 --> 34:22.870]  Around that empty apartment's property line.
[34:22.870 --> 34:23.870]  Yeah.
[34:23.870 --> 34:26.510]  Does the library and such count?
[34:27.070 --> 34:33.630]  Not for this rule package, but that tends not to matter.
[34:33.630 --> 34:40.630]  There were several other buffer zones listed around our medical shops, which is why they've
[34:40.630 --> 34:48.150]  been allowed with no store cap for four or five years and we only have three.
[34:48.150 --> 34:52.110]  With zoning rules, you can really limit the allowed businesses in an area.
[34:52.110 --> 34:59.590]  This is why if your area passed legalization recently, you really need to brush up on local
[34:59.590 --> 35:03.910]  politics and get down to planning and zoning and city council or county commission meetings
[35:03.910 --> 35:11.110]  now because these rules are being decided for your area right now.
[35:11.110 --> 35:16.870]  If you're not involved, people who do give a shit enough to show up, it's their voice
[35:16.870 --> 35:18.670]  that helps craft these rules.
[35:18.670 --> 35:22.790]  If it's two people that really hate weed for one reason or another and one person that
[35:22.790 --> 35:27.790]  loves weed but is really inarticulate, expect ugly rules.
[35:27.790 --> 35:28.790]  Yeah.
[35:28.790 --> 35:31.950]  If you know how to grow and you were all about talking with city council, go down there,
[35:31.950 --> 35:35.790]  represent them, tell them why their guidelines aren't going to work for a typical grow.
[35:35.790 --> 35:38.190]  I was thinking about it.
[35:38.190 --> 35:45.390]  I cannot recall buying cannabis in a Pueblo dispensary since the legalization of recreational
[35:45.390 --> 35:46.390]  cannabis.
[35:46.390 --> 35:49.150]  That's the last time I can remember shopping in a Pueblo dispensary.
[35:49.150 --> 35:52.430]  I rarely shop in a store.
[35:52.430 --> 35:58.230]  I make sure to get out to the stores as often as possible just to see what everybody's doing.
[35:58.230 --> 36:02.870]  But as far as supply goes, I'm not a lot different than you, buddy.
[36:02.870 --> 36:03.870]  Yeah.
[36:03.870 --> 36:05.070]  Well, I know your caregiver and he does a good job.
[36:05.070 --> 36:06.550]  This Cascade Shatter is tasty.
[36:06.550 --> 36:07.550]  He does.
[36:07.550 --> 36:08.550]  He does a really nice job.
[36:08.550 --> 36:09.550]  That cough was brought to you by Iry Genetics.
[36:09.550 --> 36:10.550]  Yes.
[36:10.550 --> 36:11.550]  Yes.
[36:11.550 --> 36:12.550]  And also our good friends at Elevate Glass.
[36:13.550 --> 36:16.990]  So that was the good Pueblo news that we screwed up on election night.
[36:16.990 --> 36:18.590]  That was our big blooper from that show.
[36:18.590 --> 36:19.590]  Yes.
[36:19.590 --> 36:20.750]  The next thing I've got written down, you can see it.
[36:20.750 --> 36:21.750]  It says Maine.
[36:21.750 --> 36:22.750]  If you want to tell us about Maine, go for it, buddy.
[36:22.750 --> 36:27.430]  So Maine voted to legalize recreational marijuana.
[36:27.430 --> 36:32.790]  The vote passed by a very, very, very, very slim margin.
[36:32.790 --> 36:35.790]  Statewide it was like 1,500, 1,200 votes or something.
[36:35.790 --> 36:37.910]  It was very, very close.
[36:37.910 --> 36:44.190]  So the anti-pop people forced a recount costing the state half a million bucks.
[36:44.190 --> 36:46.070]  That recount is underway now.
[36:46.070 --> 36:50.030]  It's paused for the weekend.
[36:50.030 --> 36:56.630]  They've counted all of the cities in county areas that the anti-pop people were sure were
[36:56.630 --> 37:01.870]  going to give them the numbers to reverse the vote.
[37:01.870 --> 37:04.910]  And the outcome hasn't changed.
[37:04.910 --> 37:06.710]  Legalization is still winning.
[37:06.710 --> 37:11.310]  And the really funny part of the story to me is, so in Maine, the election rules, if
[37:11.310 --> 37:17.070]  you push for a recount and you get it, the pro side and the anti side for whatever issue
[37:17.070 --> 37:24.390]  is getting recounted have to send 10 volunteers every day to the recount office.
[37:24.390 --> 37:29.390]  It still costs the state half a million dollars to do this, even with using volunteers from
[37:29.390 --> 37:30.950]  the campaigns.
[37:30.950 --> 37:37.630]  And the anti-pop people in Maine can't get 10 people to show up every day.
[37:37.630 --> 37:42.270]  And so the recount's taken a lot longer than it should have.
[37:42.270 --> 37:48.630]  Election staffers have had to stand in and cover for anti-legalization volunteers that
[37:48.630 --> 37:52.630]  weren't able to make it on time or were late.
[37:52.630 --> 37:56.310]  Several days, or a couple days in a row when this first started, and it just happened again
[37:56.310 --> 37:59.590]  here at the end of the week, they didn't have enough people to show.
[37:59.590 --> 38:06.510]  Luckily, the pro-pop people have had extra volunteers willing to work and have been willing
[38:06.510 --> 38:12.630]  to work some longer hours to make sure that this gets recounted correctly and accurately
[38:12.630 --> 38:17.110]  so that the recount is still on track to finish up when it's supposed to.
[38:17.110 --> 38:22.710]  But the anti-pop people were so convinced that they had this in the bag, so convinced
[38:22.710 --> 38:28.110]  that they had the majority of people, that they forced the recount and a half million
[38:28.110 --> 38:29.110]  in taxes to be spent.
[38:29.110 --> 38:30.110]  They can't even get 10 volunteers.
[38:30.110 --> 38:31.110]  That's funny.
[38:31.110 --> 38:32.110]  Like, come on now.
[38:32.110 --> 38:37.750]  How many things are still being recounted nationwide?
[38:37.750 --> 38:38.750]  Total election-wide?
[38:38.750 --> 38:42.510]  There's a bunch, but it's all little stuff.
[38:42.510 --> 38:43.910]  It's statewide issues.
[38:43.910 --> 38:47.150]  Well, there aren't that many that are still counting.
[38:47.150 --> 38:48.470]  For full weeks, right?
[38:48.470 --> 38:50.110]  Since the election.
[38:50.110 --> 38:53.390]  Recounting is a huge process because it's done by hand.
[38:53.390 --> 38:59.870]  And basically, so in Maine, the 10 people from each side pair up and then they're given
[38:59.870 --> 39:02.830]  an election person.
[39:02.830 --> 39:09.550]  And then those three people go sit at a table and you look at the ballot and both the pro
[39:09.550 --> 39:12.990]  and the anti-people agree that that's a yes vote.
[39:12.990 --> 39:17.030]  And the third guy from the election commission is there to make sure that the two, the anti
[39:17.030 --> 39:18.550]  and the pro people don't fight.
[39:18.550 --> 39:19.550]  Or lie.
[39:19.550 --> 39:22.910]  And that they play nice and follow the rules.
[39:23.910 --> 39:26.710]  I mean, it takes an insane amount of time.
[39:26.710 --> 39:29.470]  On election night, they're just funneling these fuckers through a machine.
[39:29.470 --> 39:32.390]  And you can do thousands a minute or thousands a second.
[39:32.390 --> 39:35.710]  Unless you're Pueblo and then you crash your fucking shitty server.
[39:35.710 --> 39:40.070]  Oh, Pueblo.
[39:40.070 --> 39:44.950]  But the recount is an incredibly taxing process, but there aren't that many that are still
[39:44.950 --> 39:45.950]  going.
[39:45.950 --> 39:50.670]  Typically by now, one side has gone, okay, the vote clearly hasn't changed.
[39:50.670 --> 39:57.710]  We're down to just the tiny towns or the areas that voted strongly one way or the other.
[39:57.710 --> 39:59.390]  It's not going to matter.
[39:59.390 --> 40:00.390]  Let's let it go.
[40:00.390 --> 40:03.430]  And they've conceded at this point.
[40:03.430 --> 40:07.110]  The anti-pot thing or the anti-pot group in Maine is one of the few holdouts that are
[40:07.110 --> 40:08.790]  still fighting.
[40:08.790 --> 40:11.070]  They don't have a chance.
[40:11.070 --> 40:16.030]  So what this means, if you happen to listen to the podcast and you live in Maine, way.
[40:16.030 --> 40:17.550]  First shout out for listening.
[40:17.550 --> 40:18.950]  We appreciate it.
[40:19.230 --> 40:23.950]  Second, get involved locally because in a couple of weeks, when all this is said and
[40:23.950 --> 40:30.470]  done and it's official and marijuana is legal, at best, you're going to be talking to local
[40:30.470 --> 40:35.110]  government officials who will be saying over and over and over again, well, the vote was
[40:35.110 --> 40:36.670]  really close.
[40:36.670 --> 40:39.950]  So we hear what both sides are saying.
[40:39.950 --> 40:43.990]  We're going to give the anti-pot people nine out of the 10 things they want.
[40:43.990 --> 40:47.430]  And we're going to give the pro-marijuana people one out of the 10 things they want
[40:47.670 --> 40:49.350]  because it was a close vote.
[40:49.350 --> 40:52.830]  And if you don't get on top of it now and figure out exactly how these rules get made
[40:52.830 --> 40:59.230]  in your area, you're going to be driving a really long distance to the only dispensary
[40:59.230 --> 41:00.230]  in your area.
[41:00.230 --> 41:03.350]  And it's going to be crazy expensive to buy weed there.
[41:03.350 --> 41:06.190]  Well, if it's Maine, it won't be that far.
[41:06.190 --> 41:07.590]  It's still cold.
[41:07.590 --> 41:14.110]  I honestly have no idea exactly how big that state is, but I don't want to drive 45 minutes
[41:14.110 --> 41:15.110]  to the weed store.
[41:15.110 --> 41:16.110]  No.
[41:16.110 --> 41:17.470]  I don't want to drive 20 minutes to the weed store.
[41:17.470 --> 41:20.630]  Because that means then you got to drive 45 minutes home before you can smoke that new
[41:20.630 --> 41:21.630]  weed.
[41:21.630 --> 41:22.630]  Yep.
[41:22.630 --> 41:23.630]  And if there's, I mean-
[41:23.630 --> 41:24.630]  You just gave me a nostalgic feeling.
[41:24.630 --> 41:25.630]  Remember when you used to go to the dispensary?
[41:25.630 --> 41:26.630]  I don't have it now.
[41:26.630 --> 41:27.630]  I'm sorry.
[41:27.630 --> 41:28.630]  I'm jaded.
[41:28.630 --> 41:29.630]  But I remember the feeling.
[41:29.630 --> 41:30.630]  I just took a fat dab, you guys.
[41:30.630 --> 41:31.630]  I apologize for the chokes.
[41:31.630 --> 41:34.070]  While Mike was on his rant there, I took a couple dabs.
[41:34.070 --> 41:37.750]  Remember when you used to go to the dispensary and you'd be like, oh, you want one?
[41:37.750 --> 41:38.750]  Here, I got you, bro.
[41:38.750 --> 41:39.750]  Yep.
[41:39.750 --> 41:42.110]  Well, I've got the hash if you've got a dab tool with a carb cap too.
[41:42.110 --> 41:43.110]  Yeah.
[41:43.110 --> 41:45.110]  I'm going to use that email because it's kind of claw.
[41:45.110 --> 41:47.110]  I used it to be quiet and not use a torch.
[41:47.110 --> 41:48.110]  All right.
[41:48.110 --> 41:49.110]  Here's a dab.
[41:49.110 --> 41:50.110]  There's a dabber.
[41:50.110 --> 41:51.110]  Here's a torch.
[41:51.110 --> 41:52.110]  And here's a rig.
[41:52.110 --> 41:53.110]  With a bucket.
[41:53.110 --> 41:54.110]  Yes.
[41:54.110 --> 41:56.910]  Shout out to our friends at Elevate for keeping me stocked up on fresh bangers.
[41:56.910 --> 41:58.470]  Shout out to Quince bangers.
[41:58.470 --> 41:59.990]  And there's a carb cap.
[41:59.990 --> 42:04.350]  Remember that feeling when you would go to the, like, I would do, I'm kind of a nerd.
[42:04.350 --> 42:08.710]  I would do research online and find out what the hottest strains are in Denver or in Colorado.
[42:08.710 --> 42:09.710]  And I would go find that.
[42:09.710 --> 42:12.990]  If it was a Bruce Banner, I'd go find where they had some Bruce Banner.
[42:13.870 --> 42:15.190]  What was the strain that they had at the Denver relief?
[42:15.190 --> 42:16.190]  They had the biodiesel.
[42:16.190 --> 42:19.190]  I don't know if they're in, got the biodiesel.
[42:19.190 --> 42:21.630]  The one that started with a V.
[42:21.630 --> 42:22.630]  The vortex?
[42:22.630 --> 42:23.630]  Yeah, the vortex.
[42:23.630 --> 42:24.950]  That's from TGA sub cool.
[42:24.950 --> 42:33.190]  I was going to the clinic on Mexico in Denver and I was getting the vortex wax.
[42:33.190 --> 42:34.590]  And I would say, how much do you have of that?
[42:34.590 --> 42:35.590]  And they'd say this much.
[42:35.590 --> 42:36.790]  And I'd say, I'll take it.
[42:36.790 --> 42:37.790]  Yeah.
[42:37.790 --> 42:38.790]  They started setting limits because of me.
[42:38.790 --> 42:39.790]  Started setting purchase limits.
[42:39.790 --> 42:42.710]  But I remember the first week they put those purchase limits in place.
[42:43.430 --> 42:45.430]  I remember when the girls screwed up when we were there and we still bought it all.
[42:45.430 --> 42:46.430]  Yeah.
[42:46.430 --> 42:47.430]  Thanks, Brittany.
[42:47.430 --> 42:48.430]  I remember who that was.
[42:48.430 --> 42:49.430]  We appreciate that.
[42:49.430 --> 42:51.430]  That was a hookup like a decade ago and we still appreciate it.
[42:51.430 --> 42:52.430]  Yeah, we do.
[42:52.430 --> 42:55.750]  That was actually when I bought my Hitman rig.
[42:55.750 --> 42:58.790]  So I remember the feeling I would get when I would leave the dispensary with that specific
[42:58.790 --> 43:01.590]  strain that I was so excited about going to find.
[43:01.590 --> 43:02.710]  It's like you're like skipping.
[43:02.710 --> 43:05.830]  It's like almost the feeling when I was a little kid and I'd get a new video game.
[43:05.830 --> 43:08.910]  Whenever the new Zelda or Super Mario came out and I'd like, oh, I got it.
[43:08.910 --> 43:11.150]  I got to go home and show my friends.
[43:11.150 --> 43:12.470]  And you'd go home and call one of your buddies.
[43:13.230 --> 43:14.830]  And this is the same thing would happen with weed.
[43:14.830 --> 43:17.750]  You'd go home and call your friends like, bro, Mike, you got to come over.
[43:17.750 --> 43:19.110]  I got some biodiesel, bro.
[43:19.110 --> 43:20.110]  You got to come check it out.
[43:20.110 --> 43:24.310]  And you drive over and I try to keep that jar closed until you got here so that when
[43:24.310 --> 43:28.750]  I cracked it open, it was just fucking, oh, biodiesel in the face.
[43:28.750 --> 43:30.950]  And then we grind a little bit of it up and smoke it together.
[43:30.950 --> 43:35.470]  And it'd be like that anticipation from the car to the house of like, oh, God, just Mike,
[43:35.470 --> 43:36.470]  meet me at the house.
[43:36.470 --> 43:38.030]  Don't even make me wait, bro.
[43:38.030 --> 43:41.830]  I miss the drive home from picking up weed for sure.
[43:42.190 --> 43:46.830]  When that was like an hour and 20 minute drive.
[43:46.830 --> 43:48.750]  That was stressful.
[43:48.750 --> 43:51.550]  Like by the time you got home, that adrenaline high.
[43:51.550 --> 43:54.790]  You're not allowed to take more dabs on the show.
[43:54.790 --> 43:58.230]  Yeah, that was that was a good one.
[43:58.230 --> 44:04.710]  But that adrenaline high from driving home with a bag of weed and then sitting down grinding
[44:04.710 --> 44:05.710]  it up.
[44:05.710 --> 44:08.310]  It's like it's like the sweet reward.
[44:08.310 --> 44:09.870]  It's like I finally made it.
[44:09.870 --> 44:10.870]  And it was so nice.
[44:10.910 --> 44:11.910]  It was like you.
[44:11.910 --> 44:13.310]  I felt like I almost it was more of a reward.
[44:13.310 --> 44:17.270]  I used to get higher than like because you had that like, oh, I fucking did it.
[44:17.270 --> 44:18.910]  I went because it used to be a struggle.
[44:18.910 --> 44:20.830]  It used to be a mission, a stoner mission.
[44:20.830 --> 44:23.430]  You would have to find do you have weed?
[44:23.430 --> 44:24.630]  There'd be two or three guys.
[44:24.630 --> 44:26.510]  It'd be that first guy you'd always want to try.
[44:26.510 --> 44:28.070]  And he was my friend with bad eyes.
[44:28.070 --> 44:31.030]  And his name started with a J. If you're if you're my crew, you know I'm talking about
[44:31.030 --> 44:32.670]  hit that guy first all the time.
[44:32.670 --> 44:34.670]  See if he's got that sour diesel.
[44:34.670 --> 44:36.410]  If not, I'd try a couple other dudes.
[44:36.410 --> 44:39.430]  But if you got to find out where they are, if they got what you want and if they can
[44:39.430 --> 44:41.790]  meet you somewhere, then you got to meet up somewhere and you got to sit in a sketchy
[44:41.790 --> 44:45.470]  parking lot or go to a sketchy house and then you got to get it.
[44:45.470 --> 44:48.150]  I always had three or four people.
[44:48.150 --> 44:52.630]  And on my way to work, I would hit up my favorite and my lunch.
[44:52.630 --> 44:54.750]  If I ain't heard back, I would hit up the other two.
[44:54.750 --> 44:55.750]  Yep.
[44:55.750 --> 44:56.750]  There you go.
[44:56.750 --> 45:00.270]  By the end of the day, guaranteed one of them would have hit me back.
[45:00.270 --> 45:02.630]  And then I'd go wait in a sketchy parking lot.
[45:02.630 --> 45:03.950]  Yep.
[45:03.950 --> 45:05.590]  I don't miss those days.
[45:05.750 --> 45:13.510]  I kind of miss that extra high from the adrenaline and the drive and the anticipation.
[45:13.510 --> 45:22.470]  But I feel it every time that I do hit a dispensary now or even when I come over and pick up from
[45:22.470 --> 45:27.510]  my caregiver, when I get back in the car.
[45:27.510 --> 45:30.870]  There's no like, where am I going to put this process?
[45:30.870 --> 45:33.870]  There's no, oh man, this is dank as fuck.
[45:33.870 --> 45:39.230]  Like it was the other day when I picked up from my caregiver the last time when I got
[45:39.230 --> 45:43.710]  in the car, I was like, is that, nope, that's my bag.
[45:43.710 --> 45:51.670]  Inside is a proper packaging inside my shoulder bag in the backseat of my car is still stinking
[45:51.670 --> 45:54.150]  out the whole cab.
[45:54.150 --> 45:58.150]  Back in the day, this was, this is when the adrenaline really kicks in.
[45:58.150 --> 45:59.150]  Yeah.
[45:59.150 --> 46:01.710]  Do you roll all the windows down and drive home in 20 degree weather anyway?
[46:01.710 --> 46:03.350]  You make that meeting with the dude.
[46:03.350 --> 46:06.030]  As soon as that bag and money exchanges.
[46:06.030 --> 46:09.230]  Now you're like, fuck, I just went from like, got to get this, got to find it.
[46:09.230 --> 46:10.230]  Where is it?
[46:10.230 --> 46:11.230]  Is it going to happen?
[46:11.230 --> 46:12.230]  Is the deal going to go smooth too?
[46:12.230 --> 46:13.230]  Now I got to get this shit home.
[46:13.230 --> 46:14.230]  Right?
[46:14.230 --> 46:17.390]  Now we're somewhere or to whoever's house we're partying in tonight.
[46:17.390 --> 46:22.590]  And then you got to make that drive and your heart starts going.
[46:22.590 --> 46:24.710]  And then you see a cop, all you can do is fucking see a cop.
[46:24.710 --> 46:28.110]  He could be going the other way, 90 to 90 miles an hour.
[46:28.110 --> 46:29.110]  You're like, oh fuck the cops.
[46:29.510 --> 46:31.790]  And you got to like check yourself and be cool.
[46:31.790 --> 46:32.790]  Yeah.
[46:32.790 --> 46:36.110]  So by the time you do get home and you start getting that grin, you get it, you park the
[46:36.110 --> 46:39.230]  car because you're not going to get pulled over once you park the car, you pretty much
[46:39.230 --> 46:40.230]  got home.
[46:40.230 --> 46:44.110]  You take the keys out and you're like, oh, and by the time you unlock the door, you're
[46:44.110 --> 46:46.590]  almost, you can, your hands start doing the grinder motion.
[46:46.590 --> 46:48.710]  Like I'm going to grind this weed up.
[46:48.710 --> 46:52.430]  And by the time you light it, your heart is like in this special place.
[46:52.430 --> 46:55.270]  And that first puff just puts you like, it's like a mission accomplished.
[46:55.270 --> 46:58.030]  It's like, you just rescued the fucking princess.
[46:58.030 --> 46:59.030]  Princess was sweet.
[46:59.030 --> 47:00.030]  Mary Jane.
[47:00.030 --> 47:07.830]  I'm nostalgic for it, but I wouldn't give, go back to it for all the money in the world.
[47:07.830 --> 47:12.550]  Like there's nothing that could get me to go back to having to do all that shit.
[47:12.550 --> 47:17.070]  I love getting, I mean, on the off chance I get pulled over and I've got weed in the
[47:17.070 --> 47:18.950]  car, I love being in a Vortigaunt.
[47:18.950 --> 47:19.950]  Is there weed in the car?
[47:19.950 --> 47:20.950]  Yep.
[47:20.950 --> 47:21.950]  Yep.
[47:21.950 --> 47:24.270]  Oh, I got pulled over and the cop was 10 feet from my car before he goes to serve.
[47:24.270 --> 47:25.430]  Do you have marijuana in there?
[47:25.430 --> 47:26.430]  Cause he could smell it.
[47:26.430 --> 47:27.430]  Yep.
[47:27.430 --> 47:29.950]  I looked him straight in the face and I said, yeah, probably.
[47:29.950 --> 47:30.950]  There's probably some weed in here.
[47:30.950 --> 47:32.270]  I'm not going to even try to lie.
[47:32.270 --> 47:35.470]  And he was, once I said yes, that cop was like, cool.
[47:35.470 --> 47:41.270]  I got pulled over, leaving a big production grow that I was trimming at for a while.
[47:41.270 --> 47:48.710]  And so like I didn't have anything on me, but I probably had like eight or nine grams
[47:48.710 --> 47:54.390]  of just like marijuana juice, not oil or extract or anything, but like just the pulp from the
[47:54.390 --> 48:00.070]  like family stem, like just in my shoes, just soaked in through the bottom.
[48:00.070 --> 48:04.430]  And I stumped to high heaven because I'd been trimming for like 10 hours.
[48:04.430 --> 48:06.710]  I was, are we in the car?
[48:06.710 --> 48:08.710]  No, but I work in the industry.
[48:08.710 --> 48:09.910]  I've been harvesting all day.
[48:09.910 --> 48:11.870]  I understand that I stink to high heaven.
[48:11.870 --> 48:14.430]  And he was like, well, you're all clear eyed and shit.
[48:14.430 --> 48:17.950]  So let's just see your badge and your driver's license and your other thing.
[48:17.950 --> 48:18.950]  Cool.
[48:18.950 --> 48:19.950]  Let me run your, your car information.
[48:19.950 --> 48:21.630]  You're good to have a nice night.
[48:21.630 --> 48:22.630]  Yep.
[48:23.030 --> 48:26.750]  Just so you know, I can smell you like four cars behind you.
[48:26.750 --> 48:30.350]  I could, I knew someone in front of me was just stinking.
[48:30.350 --> 48:31.350]  It's like, yeah, yeah.
[48:31.350 --> 48:32.350]  Sorry.
[48:32.350 --> 48:35.390]  Like sober as a judge, just working all day.
[48:35.390 --> 48:36.390]  Harvest time.
[48:36.390 --> 48:37.390]  You can really smell that.
[48:37.390 --> 48:39.510]  I don't know, bartender friend who's been pulled over several times.
[48:39.510 --> 48:43.310]  It's like, I swear to God, officer, what you're smelling right now is my socks.
[48:43.310 --> 48:44.310]  I'm sober.
[48:44.310 --> 48:45.990]  I just, I work at a bar.
[48:45.990 --> 48:46.990]  Oh yeah.
[48:46.990 --> 48:48.310]  I used to hate that as a musician.
[48:48.310 --> 48:49.470]  I wouldn't drink.
[48:49.470 --> 48:50.470]  Like I quit drinking.
[48:50.470 --> 48:51.470]  I was, I did drink it for plenty.
[48:51.470 --> 48:52.470]  Don't, don't get me wrong.
[48:53.310 --> 48:56.270]  I didn't drink fucking plenty, but I learned not to be at the club cleaning up or whatever.
[48:56.270 --> 48:59.070]  And somebody had spilled some beer on you or on your equipment or whatever.
[48:59.070 --> 49:01.270]  And you're in the car and it just reeks that beer smell.
[49:01.270 --> 49:04.550]  Maybe you driving home like, fuck, I smell like beer.
[49:04.550 --> 49:05.550]  Terrible.
[49:05.550 --> 49:11.670]  It's, it's a, it's so nice that it was literally the only part of my life where I was way out
[49:11.670 --> 49:13.590]  of whack with legal.
[49:13.590 --> 49:16.110]  I've actually been kicked out of restaurants or denied service.
[49:16.110 --> 49:17.110]  They didn't even kick me out.
[49:17.110 --> 49:22.310]  They're just like, no, why don't you guys go take a shower and come back?
[49:23.150 --> 49:29.070]  I had someone walk up and they went to do the, so table for three and they went, so
[49:29.070 --> 49:30.070]  take out.
[49:30.070 --> 49:31.070]  Yeah.
[49:31.070 --> 49:32.070]  Yeah.
[49:32.070 --> 49:33.310]  Carry out at the skirted Heifer in Colorado Springs.
[49:33.310 --> 49:36.710]  I wasn't going to say the name of a restaurant, but, uh, and like, I don't blame them.
[49:36.710 --> 49:37.970]  The entire trim crew.
[49:37.970 --> 49:41.790]  Like it was, I, the, we were going to dinner, we were trimming and put down the trim to
[49:41.790 --> 49:42.790]  go to dinner.
[49:42.790 --> 49:45.190]  It was four of us that were working at caregiver gross.
[49:45.190 --> 49:50.510]  So we like, we didn't have any of the like protective layering that you wear at a production
[49:50.510 --> 49:51.510]  facility.
[49:51.710 --> 49:54.310]  So we had like trim mashed into our shoes and we'd stuck to our feet.
[49:54.310 --> 49:55.310]  It's at that facility.
[49:55.310 --> 49:59.070]  We pretty much sat around the table just like this in our t-shirts and shorts and trimmed
[49:59.070 --> 50:00.670]  with rubber gloves on.
[50:00.670 --> 50:03.430]  And then we would go smoke at a friend's house.
[50:03.430 --> 50:06.430]  Cause do you know, so we had a friend that lived between the grow and downtown.
[50:06.430 --> 50:08.030]  She's like, we'll stop over there.
[50:08.030 --> 50:09.590]  That's the apartment get wrecked.
[50:09.590 --> 50:12.990]  And then we drove right to the food place and we go, we're like, Hey, we need to, and
[50:12.990 --> 50:14.630]  they're like, no, you guys are going to eat outside.
[50:14.630 --> 50:15.630]  We're like, what?
[50:15.630 --> 50:17.230]  And they're like, no, your table is outside guys.
[50:17.230 --> 50:18.390]  And we're like, oh fuck.
[50:18.390 --> 50:19.910]  It's like four degrees out here.
[50:19.910 --> 50:23.510]  So our high asses all ate outside because they wouldn't let us sit inside the restaurant.
[50:23.510 --> 50:25.470]  But the place was filled with families.
[50:25.470 --> 50:28.430]  Like you could see people looking at us offended.
[50:28.430 --> 50:32.670]  Like I can smell your weed over the burgers in the skirt at Heifer and listeners.
[50:32.670 --> 50:33.750]  Yes, I am a vegetarian.
[50:33.750 --> 50:37.070]  The skirt at Heifer serves a quinoa burger that is marvelous.
[50:37.070 --> 50:38.830]  So don't get me wrong.
[50:38.830 --> 50:43.350]  I don't blame restaurants when like, I don't care what you do for work all day.
[50:43.350 --> 50:48.110]  If you're, if you're funky enough from it to, to funk out a whole restaurant, you probably
[50:48.110 --> 50:50.190]  shouldn't go straight from work to the restaurant and eat.
[50:50.190 --> 50:52.630]  Like, I don't care what you do or why you stink.
[50:52.630 --> 50:55.230]  So I didn't blame them.
[50:55.230 --> 51:00.790]  Some restaurants back in the day when I, I noticed before we had legal cannabis legalization
[51:00.790 --> 51:04.430]  and it was a known thing, I would show up to restaurants with my scuzzy looking friends
[51:04.430 --> 51:06.030]  because I know I'm not the cleanest looking person.
[51:06.030 --> 51:07.510]  I bathe on a regular basis.
[51:07.510 --> 51:08.910]  The reason they call us.
[51:08.910 --> 51:11.710]  Yes, but I do look like Chewbacca's fucking baby cousin.
[51:11.710 --> 51:14.390]  I've got dreadlocks past my ass, almost to my knees.
[51:14.390 --> 51:15.550]  I've got a fuzzy beard.
[51:15.550 --> 51:16.790]  You can hear it.
[51:16.790 --> 51:17.790]  That's my beard.
[51:18.470 --> 51:19.470]  I got a goatee.
[51:19.470 --> 51:20.470]  I got a mustache.
[51:20.470 --> 51:23.590]  I wore a crooked hat and a t-shirt and Dickies and skateboard shoes.
[51:23.590 --> 51:26.190]  And I walk into restaurants and back in the day, and I smell like weed.
[51:26.190 --> 51:27.670]  I just constantly smell like herb.
[51:27.670 --> 51:29.390]  If I'm growing it, smoking it, whatever.
[51:29.390 --> 51:31.030]  I smell like cannabis.
[51:31.030 --> 51:34.630]  I would walk into restaurants and they would kind of roll their eyes and be like, fuck,
[51:34.630 --> 51:36.670]  let's sit these weirdos in a corner.
[51:36.670 --> 51:39.270]  Now that the industry is the way that it is.
[51:39.270 --> 51:44.230]  They know that kids that look like myself and you and Kev bro and whoever else used
[51:44.230 --> 51:48.030]  to roll with me to places, they treat us like fucking rock stars now, bro.
[51:48.030 --> 51:52.190]  When the Grimey Gatsby and I would go to dinner in Colorado Springs, that waitress would be
[51:52.190 --> 51:55.510]  up our butts because they know it's like these are weed industry people and they get paid
[51:55.510 --> 51:56.510]  well.
[51:56.510 --> 51:58.310]  I'm going to be super fucking nice to them.
[51:58.310 --> 52:00.910]  Not that they get paid well.
[52:00.910 --> 52:08.070]  They get paid well now and in the near future, in the very recent past, they worked a job
[52:08.070 --> 52:12.870]  where tips or at least service was a big part of it.
[52:12.870 --> 52:13.870]  Right.
[52:14.510 --> 52:19.230]  And so when we go out to eat now, we understand that the person serving us our food is making
[52:19.230 --> 52:26.190]  less than minimum wage and that if one or two of her tables stiffs or throughout a shift,
[52:26.190 --> 52:28.510]  she's going to have trouble making ends meet.
[52:28.510 --> 52:31.750]  And so if the service is good, we always over tip.
[52:31.750 --> 52:32.750]  Yeah.
[52:32.750 --> 52:33.750]  Yeah.
[52:33.750 --> 52:34.750]  Just as a community, we kind of take care of each other.
[52:34.750 --> 52:40.150]  I can always, when I was doing food service, I could always tell which one of my tables
[52:40.150 --> 52:42.870]  or which customers also worked in the service industry.
[52:42.870 --> 52:46.790]  I've heard every one of my food service friends has said that before.
[52:46.790 --> 52:47.790]  Yep.
[52:47.790 --> 52:48.790]  You can always tell.
[52:48.790 --> 52:52.870]  And you can tell who's like no one in their families worked in the service industry in
[52:52.870 --> 52:54.510]  a couple of generations.
[52:54.510 --> 52:58.590]  You can tell those fuckers too from a mile away.
[52:58.590 --> 53:03.790]  And I mean, it makes a big difference if you're a server to know who to treat a little better.
[53:03.790 --> 53:07.830]  I love it when you take a girl out to dinner and when the dinner's over, she starts gathering
[53:07.830 --> 53:09.510]  plates and sets them at the edge of the table.
[53:09.510 --> 53:13.150]  And you're like, Hey, you're awesome, but you're not at work right now.
[53:13.150 --> 53:14.150]  You can chill out on it.
[53:14.150 --> 53:15.670]  Like, yeah, that's so rad to see.
[53:15.670 --> 53:17.030]  Like you're fucking awesome.
[53:17.030 --> 53:18.030]  Good work.
[53:18.030 --> 53:20.670]  All right, Mike, I don't know how we just ended up on this fucking rant.
[53:20.670 --> 53:21.670]  We're in a random field.
[53:21.670 --> 53:22.670]  This is a fun show.
[53:22.670 --> 53:23.670]  We're just talking about random shit suddenly.
[53:23.670 --> 53:26.390]  Lots of serious and lots of we're high to table.
[53:26.390 --> 53:27.390]  Join us.
[53:27.390 --> 53:28.390]  Yes.
[53:28.390 --> 53:29.790]  I took a couple of notes that I want to make sure to mention.
[53:29.790 --> 53:31.310]  We've got some other bullet points.
[53:31.310 --> 53:32.310]  Let's hit, let's hit them.
[53:32.310 --> 53:34.430]  I'm just going to tease them because we're going to do these in another podcast.
[53:34.430 --> 53:35.430]  We're not even going to hit them.
[53:35.430 --> 53:36.430]  We're going to do a double show.
[53:36.430 --> 53:37.430]  Yeah.
[53:37.430 --> 53:38.430]  I'm going to tease them.
[53:38.430 --> 53:39.430]  These are just coming up.
[53:39.430 --> 53:43.270]  I want to talk about in the future.
[53:43.270 --> 53:45.150]  Somebody you touched on earlier and I wrote it down.
[53:45.150 --> 53:46.150]  Male selection.
[53:46.150 --> 53:48.750]  Somebody sent me an email about male selection and you talked about breeding.
[53:48.750 --> 53:51.310]  We're going to talk about male selection in the very near future.
[53:51.310 --> 53:56.390]  We're going to talk about the difference between lab testing and how the cannabis actually
[53:56.390 --> 53:58.670]  works for you.
[53:58.670 --> 54:02.070]  And that reminds me that I want to give another shout out to my friend, Bo.
[54:02.070 --> 54:04.390]  Bo Nellis at the Spliff podcast.
[54:04.390 --> 54:05.630]  We talk a lot about growing.
[54:05.630 --> 54:08.630]  We talk a lot about cannabis culture.
[54:08.630 --> 54:13.310]  We do it from sort of a dude bro sort of side of things.
[54:13.310 --> 54:14.310]  Sorry we can't help it.
[54:14.310 --> 54:15.310]  No, no.
[54:15.310 --> 54:16.310]  And I'm no, no.
[54:16.310 --> 54:19.470]  And I understand that that is, that's who I am and I, please don't ask me to change.
[54:19.470 --> 54:24.070]  But if you're not into the dude bro culture, dab kid sort of thing that we've got going
[54:24.070 --> 54:30.270]  on here, Bo Nellis has a great podcast called the Spliff podcast and she does it from a
[54:30.270 --> 54:35.590]  much more, um, I described it kind of like as it's learning cannabis from my kindergarten.
[54:36.550 --> 54:41.350]  But she's fucking educated and she is learning more and more as she goes on with the podcast.
[54:41.350 --> 54:48.630]  She will talk much more about specific cannabinoid dosing for specific conditions and she should
[54:48.630 --> 54:54.390]  call some of her episodes 101 ways to use my cannabis because I'm all about dabbing.
[54:54.390 --> 54:55.390]  Excuse me.
[54:55.390 --> 54:56.390]  I'm all about taking dabs.
[54:56.390 --> 54:57.670]  I'm all about smoking some flowers.
[54:57.670 --> 54:59.270]  I like some edibles.
[54:59.270 --> 55:00.950]  Bo doesn't waste a thing.
[55:00.950 --> 55:04.790]  She uses every bit of cannabinoid she can pull out of everything.
[55:04.990 --> 55:05.990]  And I appreciate it.
[55:05.990 --> 55:06.990]  That's just not my style.
[55:06.990 --> 55:12.270]  I know someone locally that, uh, there was the first person I ever met that was juicing
[55:12.270 --> 55:14.030]  raw cannabis.
[55:14.030 --> 55:19.950]  Like when they defoliate, they take all that leaf material and juice it as long as it's
[55:19.950 --> 55:20.950]  not crunchy.
[55:20.950 --> 55:25.510]  Like they toss the crunchy, but when they defoliate and it's the grain, they, they juice
[55:25.510 --> 55:26.950]  all that green leaf material.
[55:26.950 --> 55:29.630]  But she uses the stuff that she's vaporized.
[55:29.630 --> 55:33.150]  She makes a tincture with coconut oil out of that or a topical with coconut oil out
[55:33.150 --> 55:34.150]  of that.
[55:34.510 --> 55:35.510]  She uses a cannabis lotion.
[55:35.510 --> 55:39.430]  Uh, she has been making cannabis products for her cats recently.
[55:39.430 --> 55:43.390]  Like so if you guys want a different perspective on cannabis, uh, if you get tired of hearing
[55:43.390 --> 55:46.870]  our bro culture over here, which I understand some people aren't into being called dude
[55:46.870 --> 55:49.470]  and bro on the list and new podcast all the time, but if you've gotten this far and you
[55:49.470 --> 55:53.590]  must be into us, but if you want some more, a different perspective on cannabis, uh, from
[55:53.590 --> 55:57.870]  a very well-educated professional sounding woman, if you want a woman's perspective on
[55:57.870 --> 56:01.950]  cannabis, I highly recommend listening to the spliff podcast from Bo Nellis.
[56:01.950 --> 56:03.470]  She does not pay me to say that.
[56:03.470 --> 56:04.470]  I fucking appreciate the show.
[56:04.470 --> 56:05.470]  Spell it.
[56:05.470 --> 56:08.990]  Um, all you gotta do is search for, I'm going to open up my iPhone right here cause it's
[56:08.990 --> 56:11.030]  right here on my podcast screen.
[56:11.030 --> 56:13.430]  It is simply, I got to get to the top.
[56:13.430 --> 56:14.430]  I'm scrolling.
[56:14.430 --> 56:16.390]  It is cause it's spliff.
[56:16.390 --> 56:17.390]  The spliff.
[56:17.390 --> 56:18.390]  Yes.
[56:18.390 --> 56:21.390]  And pot, not pod.
[56:21.390 --> 56:22.390]  Right.
[56:22.390 --> 56:26.670]  It took me like a week to find this podcast just cause I was hearing split and pod.
[56:26.670 --> 56:27.670]  Oh, okay.
[56:27.670 --> 56:28.750]  And I thought it was the split podcast.
[56:28.750 --> 56:30.990]  I was like, this isn't a thing.
[56:30.990 --> 56:38.310]  Spliff, S P L I F F the spliff podcast P O T C A S T. And her name is Bo B O H Nellis.
[56:38.310 --> 56:39.310]  And she's a great host.
[56:39.310 --> 56:40.950]  Uh, she's a cool person.
[56:40.950 --> 56:43.030]  Bo, one day I hope we get to take a dab together.
[56:43.030 --> 56:44.030]  That'd be fun.
[56:44.030 --> 56:46.390]  Uh, I'm going to make you take like a half gram dab.
[56:46.390 --> 56:48.030]  Make you choke forever.
[56:48.030 --> 56:49.030]  Cause that's how I do it.
[56:49.030 --> 56:51.510]  But you guys, you would appreciate the show.
[56:51.510 --> 56:53.550]  If you like my show, I feel like you'll like both shows.
[56:53.550 --> 56:56.990]  She is got 63 episodes up right now.
[56:56.990 --> 56:57.990]  Nice.
[56:57.990 --> 57:01.790]  She's got like 30 something episodes in and they're getting better and better as they
[57:01.790 --> 57:02.790]  go.
[57:02.790 --> 57:11.870]  She's really good at recommending, uh, specific dosages of cannabinoids and she's much, uh,
[57:11.870 --> 57:14.510]  she doesn't over consume cannabis the way that I do.
[57:14.510 --> 57:21.310]  So she's much more on the, uh, beginner consumer side, which I, I'm not even bashing anybody.
[57:21.310 --> 57:23.390]  I miss my lower tolerance.
[57:23.390 --> 57:28.590]  I was able to do some really amazing things with some low dose cannabinoid changes.
[57:28.590 --> 57:30.910]  And most of the world is on that spectrum.
[57:30.910 --> 57:32.190]  I'm a little ridiculous.
[57:32.190 --> 57:35.230]  I'm Chewbacca's freaking cousin and I like to over dab.
[57:35.230 --> 57:36.510]  I like to over medicate.
[57:36.510 --> 57:39.350]  Uh, so if you, but that's enough of a shout out for Bo.
[57:39.350 --> 57:40.350]  I support that show.
[57:40.350 --> 57:41.350]  Listen to it.
[57:41.350 --> 57:42.350]  It's fucking great.
[57:42.350 --> 57:43.350]  I like it.
[57:43.350 --> 57:44.350]  So that's something that I wrote down.
[57:44.350 --> 57:50.430]  Um, and then we're going to read an article about particles per million in Colorado concentrates
[57:50.430 --> 57:51.430]  on one of the next episodes.
[57:51.470 --> 57:52.470]  The new PPM rules.
[57:52.470 --> 57:53.470]  Yes.
[57:53.470 --> 57:55.590]  Because I think it's something that needs to be talked about.
[57:55.590 --> 57:57.310]  You got an hour or two to stick around.
[57:57.310 --> 57:59.310]  Uh, I don't, yes.
[57:59.310 --> 58:04.470]  Let me just make sure that I, cause we, we kill our phones to do.
[58:04.470 --> 58:09.710]  We, we really try to dedicate an hour or more to you guys when we record this.
[58:09.710 --> 58:13.230]  Um, and then, and part of that involves killing our phones and I have no idea what time it
[58:13.230 --> 58:14.230]  is.
[58:14.230 --> 58:15.630]  It's 11 20 PM right now.
[58:15.630 --> 58:20.910]  And it is six degrees outside.
[58:21.390 --> 58:24.790]  It's a 50 degree or better swing today, folks.
[58:24.790 --> 58:28.190]  Um, it was nice, but windy when I was outside getting shit done earlier.
[58:28.190 --> 58:29.750]  Yeah, it was a little shitty cold.
[58:29.750 --> 58:32.870]  A little bit crazy when we've like semi flipping windy here.
[58:32.870 --> 58:35.070]  All right, let's put this podcast back on some rails.
[58:35.070 --> 58:36.070]  We've walked onto a field.
[58:36.070 --> 58:39.590]  I would say, yeah, let's, let's know.
[58:39.590 --> 58:41.270]  Uh, he's hypothetical.
[58:41.270 --> 58:42.270]  There's no PM anywhere.
[58:42.270 --> 58:44.870]  We've been careful this couple of years.
[58:44.870 --> 58:50.190]  It's just one of the fun things about Colorado is, uh, our weather's psychotic and that you,
[58:50.470 --> 58:53.030]  you need to plan your grow for like, God fucking with you.
[58:53.030 --> 58:56.830]  I leave to go to this new project I'm going to, I leave the house around six 30 in the
[58:56.830 --> 59:03.350]  morning and I'm wearing seriously pants with shorts underneath a t-shirt, a hoodie, a jacket,
[59:03.350 --> 59:06.830]  a hat that covers up my ears with my dreads down to keep me warm.
[59:06.830 --> 59:08.150]  I get to where I'm going.
[59:08.150 --> 59:13.510]  I take off the jacket, the hoodie, that hat, I put on a different hat.
[59:13.510 --> 59:17.550]  Uh, then for lunch, we go to lunch and it's nice and warm outside.
[59:17.550 --> 59:22.710]  So I put on shorts and skateboard shoes and a t-shirt and tie the hair up and put a little
[59:22.710 --> 59:23.790]  small dread hat on.
[59:23.790 --> 59:25.470]  And I wear that for the second half of the day.
[59:25.470 --> 59:30.750]  When I leave the facility that I'm working with, it is little after six.
[59:30.750 --> 59:35.190]  So then I put on again, all of the layers, every and it's cold, it's colder than, than
[59:35.190 --> 59:36.670]  it was all day.
[59:36.670 --> 59:39.270]  So we run the full weather gamut here.
[59:39.270 --> 59:42.590]  I mean, daily it go, you get most of the seasons daily.
[59:42.590 --> 59:45.710]  All the new people that haven't been here for a solid year are sick, right?
[59:45.710 --> 59:49.710]  How they're all, they're all walking around with that head shit going on.
[59:49.710 --> 59:54.390]  And all the growers that, that moved here, um, from far away.
[59:54.390 --> 59:59.590]  And I mean, even the ones that have been growing cannabis one way or another for years, um,
[59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.910]  are just fight for their first two years.
[01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:07.430]  You're trying to figure out how to, to control for, I mean, every day it's, it starts out
[01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:11.670]  at zero and then it gets to 65 and it's at zero again.
[01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.150]  How do I not get PM in this?
[01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:14.510]  How do I cure my buds in this?
[01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:16.870]  How do I balance the humidity anywhere?
[01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:23.510]  Um, I watched a guy design like $2 million with a floor heating at one point, um, to
[01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:25.830]  try to combat some of the weather here.
[01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:30.790]  Uh, it's just fun watching different people experiences, especially with, I mean, we've
[01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:32.990]  never seen an influx of people like this.
[01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.990]  It's crazy.
[01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.990]  Traffic is getting shitty.
[01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:39.070]  Um, I'm getting people asking me like the, how the fuck do people survive this?
[01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.070]  Questions a lot more.
[01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.390]  Did they make highway 53 lanes up there?
[01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.390]  What happened?
[01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:44.390]  All right guys.
[01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:51.350]  Mike and I are going to turn off some microphones, take some dabs and not do all of this to you
[01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.350]  guys.
[01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:56.750]  I want to thank everybody for listening to episode 171 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:00.030]  That means a lot that you guys listened for 171 episodes.
[01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.030]  That's incredible.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.230]  I keep saying that I'm going to put out some old episodes, but thank you.
[01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.230]  Clint said the same thing today.
[01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:05.230]  Shout out to Clint.
[01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:07.470]  Um, I keep saying I'm going to post old episodes.
[01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:08.670]  I keep having more content.
[01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:11.230]  I don't, I don't feel the need to post all of them, but I'm going to do it.
[01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.990]  You guys keep asking for old stuff.
[01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:17.470]  Um, all the emails you're sending me, I am responding to them slowly, but I'm getting
[01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:18.470]  to them.
[01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.630]  You wouldn't believe how many emails I get lately.
[01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.310]  It's Christmas time.
[01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.990]  Everybody's trying to sell me shit.
[01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:25.550]  So I just keep getting so many emails.
[01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:27.190]  Um, I'm just writing a note right now.
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:30.110]  Mike, you're looking at me like this is part of the show, but it has nothing to do with
[01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.110]  this episode.
[01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.510]  It's for the future.
[01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:33.510]  It's for the future.
[01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.070]  Um, but I'm getting to all those emails.
[01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:37.070]  Please send me more emails.
[01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:38.070]  I love it.
[01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:41.550]  I love making listener generated content that lets me know that I'm getting something out
[01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:42.550]  to at least one person.
[01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.870]  And if I'm hitting one person and probably hitting a lot of people, just one person spoke
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:46.870]  up from you.
[01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.910]  Uh, so send me those emails at grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:51.030]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:52.950]  Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.710]  Mike just took nearly two hours out of his night.
[01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:55.710]  He's going to take a little longer.
[01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:57.030]  We may record another episode.
[01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.270]  Uh, make sure you follow him on social media.
[01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:05.110]  It's Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter and Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:11.030]  There's a lot of cannabis news that we simply don't have time to work into a podcast or
[01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:16.310]  that, um, is only a minute or two worth of news.
[01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:21.430]  They like to grow a lot of that stuff gets, I post a ton of that stuff to my, uh, to my
[01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:22.950]  Facebook page every day.
[01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:29.670]  I'm Andrew, lots of, lots of local cannabis news, um, national stuff, international stuff.
[01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.190]  Um, we were going to talk about it a little tonight and we just kind of went long.
[01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:35.670]  Canada's doing some amazing stuff.
[01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:37.230]  That could be another episode here.
[01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:38.550]  I'll write that down here at the bottom.
[01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:43.510]  I've been posting a lot of stuff about Canada, Tennessee, get that floppy head.
[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:48.630]  There's a lot of really awesome marijuana news stories that, uh, um, we haven't gotten
[01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:52.990]  onto the podcast yet that are up on my social media.
[01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:55.070]  So check it out, please.
[01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:57.070]  A couple more things, a couple more things.
[01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:58.070]  We're going to wrap this one up.
[01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.190]  Uh, Patreon, you guys, I would love it.
[01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:05.790]  Patreon is a service that you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:09.950]  And Patreon is a service that allows you to contribute financially to the podcast.
[01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.830]  You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast.
[01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:14.150]  This show will always be free, free freedom.
[01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.110]  I bring you a free podcast because I love you and I love cannabis.
[01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:18.430]  I want you to grow better cannabis.
[01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:23.930]  I want cannabis to be legalized, but what you can do, you can help me pay for the cost
[01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:24.930]  of my website.
[01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:25.930]  I read genetics.
[01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.670]  Colorado is the website where this podcast is hosted.
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:32.550]  It costs me a little over $300 per year to keep that website alive.
[01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:35.670]  I am paying for that out of my pocket right now because I love podcasting.
[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.390]  It's something that I've chosen to do.
[01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:40.630]  If you would like to help me with that a little bit, that would be sweet.
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.270]  I don't want to beg you for it.
[01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:43.270]  Patreon is there for that.
[01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.330]  Go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:51.610]  You can contribute as little as $1 or you can contribute as much as you would like.
[01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.350]  You can sign up for a monthly service to where you can contribute $1 per month.
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:59.510]  Then every month on the first of the month, they'll send $1 to the podcast.
[01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:03.750]  That will help me not have to cover all the costs of the podcast out of my pocket.
[01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.230]  Everybody that shows up for the show gets a bottle of water.
[01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:08.510]  I try to buy these little microphone covers, these things here.
[01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:12.590]  I try to replace these quite frequently because you guys cough into them and they stink.
[01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:15.230]  I don't want people having to share that funky shit.
[01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:17.910]  I've made that trip to the store with you.
[01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:23.790]  If you're really dying for old content, this is a way to help make that happen.
[01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:28.750]  The reason it's not up there right now is because it would double or triple the cost
[01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.870]  to maintain the web hosting to go all, what are we, 171?
[01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:34.230]  Yeah, it's 171 now.
[01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:38.350]  Yeah, to go 171 deep, that kind of volume and storage costs a pretty penny.
[01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:39.990]  I don't want to make that promise yet.
[01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:42.950]  I've still got to get the help to cover the original.
[01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.270]  That's down the road, but definitely contribute.
[01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:49.870]  If somebody did make the proper Patreon contribution and they said,
[01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:53.990]  post an old episode, asshole, that's the way to get me to do what you want.
[01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.550]  Like money fucking talks.
[01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:56.030]  It do.
[01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.670]  Money talks.
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.230]  It's Christmas time and money talks.
[01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:59.110]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.950]  But yeah, but I'm not trying to be that way.
[01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.710]  I'm saying $1 goes a long way.
[01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:06.710]  If you don't have a dollar to contribute, I do not.
[01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:07.070]  I do.
[01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:07.790]  I'm not offended.
[01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:08.510]  I still love you.
[01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:09.390]  I still want you to listen.
[01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.070]  I still want you to grow amazing cannabis.
[01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:11.470]  Right.
[01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:15.790]  I do this so that when I'm old and too tired to do this like on our own,
[01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:19.710]  that I'm hoping that enough people know how to do it well that I can just hit a store
[01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:21.470]  and buy it at a reasonable price.
[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:22.550]  That's a good way to look at it.
[01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:27.230]  I guess that's all I want is that so by the time I'm too old to fight this fight anymore,
[01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:29.630]  that it's taken care of enough for me to just enjoy the ride.
[01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:30.390]  There you go.
[01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:33.350]  All I'm asking for is help paying for the website and buying these little microphone
[01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.510]  covers and water bottles.
[01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:35.870]  And yeah, that's all.
[01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:36.990]  How about if you can folks?
[01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.190]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.190]  That would be super awesome.
[01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:43.670]  You guys have got one more super important thing that I need to include in this episode.
[01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:45.830]  This episode comes out on Monday.
[01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:47.470]  So that means guess what?
[01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.870]  Happy birthday, Miss JB.
[01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:49.710]  Jenny Beth, I love you.
[01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:50.670]  Hope you have a great birthday.
[01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:53.430]  Hope everything goes your way.
[01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:55.070]  Yeah, I think that's all we've got for this episode.
[01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:58.190]  Mike, you got anything else to wrap it up with?
[01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:59.510]  Merry Christmas, folks.
[01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:01.510]  Merry holiday, whatever holiday it is.
[01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.230]  Yeah, happy holidays.
[01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:04.550]  I don't remember what the number is.
[01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:06.590]  Tons of them.
[01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.030]  Christmas is the next big one in my world.
[01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.590]  But happy holidays, everybody.
[01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:12.310]  I hope you have a wonderful holiday season.
[01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:17.390]  And hopefully we have another podcast for the first of the year.
[01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.190]  Oh, we're going to.
[01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:19.910]  They're going to hear from us again before Christmas.
[01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.790]  This one comes out.
[01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:21.390]  I love it.
[01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:22.470]  18th, 19th.
[01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.030]  So then that means we got seven to other.
[01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:25.950]  I'd completely forgotten.
[01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:29.670]  In my world, it's not Christmas until I eat a specific type of Christmas cookie
[01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:30.830]  that a family member makes.
[01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.830]  And I don't like it's just a thing in my world.
[01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:34.590]  I went to Hobby Lobby.
[01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:35.630]  That hasn't happened yet.
[01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.790]  So as far as I'm concerned, it's like August.
[01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:42.030]  The holidays are far, far away because I haven't had that cookie yet.
[01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.470]  We'll be joining everybody the day after Christmas.
[01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:45.710]  So Merry Christmas, everybody.
[01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:46.510]  Happy holiday.
[01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:47.190]  Happy Hanukkah.
[01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.630]  Whichever one it is you're celebrating.
[01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:49.710]  I'm not sure what all of them are.
[01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:52.350]  I don't want to sound offensive, but have a great holiday season.
[01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:53.950]  Eat some good food with your friends and family.
[01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:57.710]  If you don't have some friends and family, go to my Facebook page.
[01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:58.430]  Send me a message.
[01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:00.350]  We'll fucking chat down like that.
[01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:01.230]  We'll have some fun.
[01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.110]  Tell me what's up.
[01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:04.270]  Don't send me pictures of your food, please.
[01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.550]  We all eat the same shit.
[01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:07.190]  No, I'm not.
[01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.710]  That's the thing.
[01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:08.750]  I'm a vegetarian and I'm not.
[01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:09.550]  All right.
[01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:10.830]  We're going to wrap this episode up.
[01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:11.590]  A hashtag.
[01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:13.110]  They like it when we ramble.
[01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:16.750]  I'm so glad they like it when we ramble because dabs.
[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.950]  Because dabs.
[01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.470]  I want to thank everybody once again for listening.
[01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.230]  I want to give a huge shout out to miss Jenny Beth.
[01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:25.030]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:53.630]  It's your birthday today.
[01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:54.630]  Today.
[01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:55.630]  It's your birthday today.
[01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:56.630]  Hooray.
[01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.630]  There's a cat licking your birthday cake.
[01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:59.630]  It's your birthday today.
