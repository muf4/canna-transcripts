[00:02.810 --> 00:04.850]  Yo, what's up podcast world?
[00:04.850 --> 00:07.970]  It's time for episode number 206 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.970 --> 00:10.290]  I'm doing another throwback Thursday episode.
[00:10.290 --> 00:15.650]  This time I'm doing episodes 36, 37, and 38 of what used to be known as the I Grow Culture
[00:15.650 --> 00:19.650]  podcast currently known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:19.650 --> 00:23.930]  Before I get to the episode, I need to make a couple of updates and disclaimers.
[00:23.930 --> 00:26.130]  All of the social media has changed.
[00:26.130 --> 00:29.590]  The new social media is at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[00:29.590 --> 00:31.730]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Facebook.
[00:31.730 --> 00:36.810]  And if you'd like to send me an email, it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[00:36.810 --> 00:39.830]  Also some of my ideas and opinions may have changed.
[00:39.830 --> 00:42.150]  Some of my methods and techniques may have changed.
[00:42.150 --> 00:46.950]  I've done over 200 episodes of this podcast and I've learned a lot along the way.
[00:46.950 --> 00:47.950]  I hope you have too.
[00:47.950 --> 00:52.710]  So if I say something in these old episodes that I contradict in a new episode, go with
[00:52.710 --> 00:57.510]  the new method because this is an ever evolving industry and I learn something every day and
[00:57.510 --> 00:58.630]  I hope you do too.
[00:58.630 --> 01:00.990]  So if I said something weird, don't hold it against me.
[01:00.990 --> 01:06.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, here is episode 36, 37, and 38 of the I Grow
[01:06.650 --> 01:07.650]  Culture podcast.
[01:07.650 --> 01:08.650]  Thank you guys for listening.
[01:08.650 --> 01:22.410]  Yo, what's up ladies and gentlemen?
[01:22.410 --> 01:25.510]  It's time for episode number 36 of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[01:25.510 --> 01:28.390]  They call me Rasta Jeff and I'm your host.
[01:28.390 --> 01:31.190]  Joining me at the table today, we got our good buddies, Tall Clint.
[01:31.190 --> 01:32.190]  Hey guys.
[01:32.190 --> 01:33.190]  And our good buddy, Nemo Punk.
[01:33.190 --> 01:34.190]  What's up folks?
[01:34.190 --> 01:37.430]  It's actually Mike over there, but trying to advertise his Twitter a little bit.
[01:37.430 --> 01:38.430]  Goddamn, music's too loud.
[01:38.430 --> 01:39.430]  Tempt the Twitter.
[01:39.430 --> 01:40.430]  Wow.
[01:40.930 --> 01:41.930]  Who put the music so high?
[01:41.930 --> 01:42.930]  Jeez.
[01:42.930 --> 01:43.930]  All right.
[01:43.930 --> 01:44.930]  How you guys doing tonight?
[01:44.930 --> 01:45.930]  I'm great, brother.
[01:45.930 --> 01:46.930]  How are you?
[01:46.930 --> 01:47.930]  You look like you're in a great mood, bro.
[01:47.930 --> 01:48.930]  You got a big old smile over there.
[01:48.930 --> 01:49.930]  It's because it's Thursday.
[01:49.930 --> 01:50.930]  It's Thursday.
[01:50.930 --> 01:51.930]  Thursdays have been great for us lately.
[01:51.930 --> 01:52.930]  I don't know why.
[01:52.930 --> 01:53.930]  Thursdays have been pretty damn good.
[01:53.930 --> 01:54.930]  How you doing tonight, Mike?
[01:54.930 --> 01:55.930]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:55.930 --> 01:58.650]  It's been a stressful but fantastic week.
[01:58.650 --> 02:00.170]  It's been a very stressful week.
[02:00.170 --> 02:03.330]  Man, speaking of stressful, I owe you a huge thank you.
[02:03.330 --> 02:07.610]  Guys, we've talked about these city council meetings for the past few episodes.
[02:07.610 --> 02:10.090]  Dude, Mike, I thought he was going to stand.
[02:10.750 --> 02:14.150]  They've got a nice little seat for you there, like a real cushy chair and a microphone.
[02:14.150 --> 02:15.150]  You look like a boss.
[02:15.150 --> 02:16.150]  It's nice.
[02:16.150 --> 02:22.510]  But Mike presented a nice statement to city council, and he actually had some success
[02:22.510 --> 02:23.990]  in what he was trying to do.
[02:23.990 --> 02:26.990]  But we'll talk about that a little bit because I really want to spend some time on the city
[02:26.990 --> 02:27.990]  council meeting topic.
[02:27.990 --> 02:30.350]  There's a lot of stuff to talk about there.
[02:30.350 --> 02:35.390]  It's been a crazy week in marijuana ordinance news, I suppose.
[02:35.390 --> 02:37.430]  So we'll get to that in a few minutes, folks.
[02:37.430 --> 02:39.630]  We for sure will.
[02:40.170 --> 02:43.330]  We talked about this a little bit on the last episode, but Clint wasn't here.
[02:43.330 --> 02:46.650]  Clint and I got to go see Joey Coco Diaz.
[02:46.650 --> 02:47.650]  Joey Diaz!
[02:47.650 --> 02:48.650]  Joey Diaz.
[02:48.650 --> 02:49.850]  I skipped a part I really want to say.
[02:49.850 --> 02:55.290]  Also today we are celebrating Clint's eighth year anniversary of sobriety from alcohol.
[02:55.290 --> 02:57.010]  Yeah, way to go, man.
[02:57.010 --> 02:58.010]  Thanks, guys.
[02:58.010 --> 02:59.010]  Congrats, seriously.
[02:59.010 --> 03:01.090]  You said it's nothing to toot about, but that is.
[03:01.090 --> 03:03.290]  Eight years, that's strong.
[03:03.290 --> 03:04.290]  It's easy now.
[03:04.290 --> 03:05.290]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:05.290 --> 03:06.290]  It was tough before.
[03:06.290 --> 03:07.290]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[03:07.290 --> 03:08.290]  Well, congrats, bro.
[03:08.290 --> 03:09.290]  Thanks for sticking with it.
[03:09.950 --> 03:10.950]  I mean, you're still the drunk you were before.
[03:10.950 --> 03:11.950]  Oh, I was a piece of shit.
[03:11.950 --> 03:12.950]  I mean, I'm still a piece of shit.
[03:12.950 --> 03:15.310]  I just don't showcase it as much.
[03:15.310 --> 03:18.230]  Yeah, alcohol really displays your shitty side, doesn't it?
[03:18.230 --> 03:19.230]  Fuck yeah, it does.
[03:19.230 --> 03:20.230]  That's why I don't drink, too.
[03:20.230 --> 03:21.230]  That's why I don't drink.
[03:21.230 --> 03:22.230]  You've seen the South Park.
[03:22.230 --> 03:23.230]  I'm like trash now.
[03:23.230 --> 03:24.230]  I'm in trouble.
[03:24.230 --> 03:28.510]  You can keep pretty much anything under wraps until you get a couple of beers in you and
[03:28.510 --> 03:31.030]  then all of the demons come just pouring out.
[03:31.030 --> 03:32.030]  That was my thing.
[03:32.030 --> 03:33.030]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:33.030 --> 03:34.030]  It's a depressant.
[03:34.030 --> 03:35.030]  It is a depressant.
[03:35.030 --> 03:36.030]  That doesn't help me much.
[03:36.030 --> 03:41.410]  I quit drinking when I got my medical marijuana card and my life is easier, happier.
[03:41.410 --> 03:43.010]  When I wake up, I know where my money is.
[03:43.010 --> 03:44.410]  I know where my car is parked.
[03:44.410 --> 03:45.410]  Fuck yeah.
[03:45.410 --> 03:46.410]  I appreciate it.
[03:46.410 --> 03:47.410]  I still drink occasionally.
[03:47.410 --> 03:54.690]  I'll have Dos Equis, but for the most part, I quit five or six years back just because
[03:54.690 --> 03:57.410]  I got really good at throwing up in bars.
[03:57.410 --> 04:00.370]  I distinctly remember walking up a flight of stairs.
[04:01.370 --> 04:06.430]  It was the Celtic in downtown Denver thinking like, yeah, man, you didn't get any on you.
[04:06.430 --> 04:07.430]  You're a pro.
[04:07.430 --> 04:11.670]  I got about halfway up the stairs and it dawned on me that that's not something I wanted to
[04:11.670 --> 04:12.670]  be pro at.
[04:12.670 --> 04:19.830]  Yeah, this is just one of those like now I feel weird because I'm like 25 and all my
[04:19.830 --> 04:23.890]  social life revolves around the bars and the bar scene.
[04:23.890 --> 04:28.990]  It was a little weird to step out of that for a while, but now it's just where I live.
[04:28.990 --> 04:30.530]  Alcohol doesn't play a big role.
[04:30.530 --> 04:31.530]  Yeah.
[04:31.530 --> 04:34.730]  Once I moved away from my party town, it was a lot easier for me to quit drinking.
[04:34.730 --> 04:39.050]  I lived in Lawrence, Kansas for a little while and it's just really easy to be a Spunny in
[04:39.050 --> 04:42.830]  there and then I came here where there's a lot of drinking and I know everybody.
[04:42.830 --> 04:46.690]  So that sucked me in a little bit, but once I realized what I was doing, I just gave it
[04:46.690 --> 04:47.690]  up.
[04:47.690 --> 04:49.330]  I can smoke all the weed I can handle.
[04:49.330 --> 04:51.570]  I took a gram dab last night.
[04:51.570 --> 04:53.930]  Like why would I even need alcohol in my life at all?
[04:53.930 --> 04:55.290]  He's going to do another one tonight.
[04:55.290 --> 04:56.290]  I'm going to do it again tonight.
[04:56.290 --> 05:00.070]  I filmed myself taking a gram dab last night and the video was very disappointing.
[05:00.070 --> 05:03.950]  I put the dab on the dabber kind of wonky and it just, I have, it wasn't real.
[05:03.950 --> 05:05.270]  That was not an impressive video.
[05:05.270 --> 05:06.430]  We're going to try it again.
[05:06.430 --> 05:10.830]  It'd be a fun video if we could have like the count from Sesame Street, like photoshopped
[05:10.830 --> 05:14.110]  in there on one down, two down.
[05:14.110 --> 05:17.830]  It took me several inhales and exhales to get that dab just partially because the way
[05:17.830 --> 05:19.630]  I dropped it on the nail, I didn't time it right.
[05:19.630 --> 05:20.950]  It was my breath and starting it was.
[05:20.950 --> 05:24.270]  Shake the dab right, get the right nail, the right rig out.
[05:24.270 --> 05:25.550]  You were using a teeny rig.
[05:25.810 --> 05:28.050]  I love a big dab on a teeny rig, dude.
[05:28.050 --> 05:29.050]  There's something about it.
[05:29.050 --> 05:30.690]  There's something about it.
[05:30.690 --> 05:34.650]  Speaking of big dabs on teeny rigs, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Cannabis
[05:34.650 --> 05:36.090]  Grand Crew.
[05:36.090 --> 05:37.090]  What's Grand Crew you ask?
[05:37.090 --> 05:40.130]  You got to check out the website, CannabisGrandCrew.com.
[05:40.130 --> 05:43.490]  It's spelled Grand C R U like the Motley Crew.
[05:43.490 --> 05:49.210]  It is a private cannabis event in Aspen, Colorado hosted by the Grimey Gatsby and several of
[05:49.210 --> 05:50.210]  the industry leaders.
[05:50.210 --> 05:54.010]  I'll have a lot more information, but please check that out and support the Grimey Gatsby.
[05:54.010 --> 05:55.010]  CannabisGrandCrew.com.
[05:55.010 --> 05:59.150]  So we were going to talk about Joey Diaz before I got on this and really huge sidetrack, but
[05:59.150 --> 06:00.710]  anywhere we were, I knew where we were.
[06:00.710 --> 06:01.710]  I know what we're doing.
[06:01.710 --> 06:03.470]  I know what we're doing, dog.
[06:03.470 --> 06:05.470]  Just like Joey knows what he's doing, brother.
[06:05.470 --> 06:07.710]  Man, it was so good.
[06:07.710 --> 06:14.070]  That was, I've seen a lot of comedians and Anthony Jezelnik was one of my favorites,
[06:14.070 --> 06:18.910]  but every second of his act from the time he walks out to the time he says, thank you,
[06:18.910 --> 06:21.270]  every second of that is calculated.
[06:21.270 --> 06:23.550]  I can see him counting between jokes.
[06:24.090 --> 06:28.570]  I can see his mouth going one, two, three, and he counts to 11 and then he tells another
[06:28.570 --> 06:29.570]  joke.
[06:29.570 --> 06:30.570]  Really?
[06:30.570 --> 06:31.570]  Yeah.
[06:31.570 --> 06:32.570]  But I, and so there's that style.
[06:32.570 --> 06:33.570]  You know what I mean?
[06:33.570 --> 06:36.290]  He comes out and that's like, uh, if that was a band, who would I compare that to?
[06:36.290 --> 06:37.290]  That's like rush.
[06:37.290 --> 06:39.390]  Every note is, they know what they're doing tonight.
[06:39.390 --> 06:43.170]  Every single note all the way through Jezelnik did that.
[06:43.170 --> 06:47.770]  Joey Diaz came out and kind of had an idea of what he was going to say and just leveled
[06:47.770 --> 06:49.210]  us just being himself.
[06:49.210 --> 06:50.370]  That was so good.
[06:50.390 --> 06:53.550]  Most of that, maybe he's told those bits two or three times.
[06:53.550 --> 06:58.310]  One of the bits he told, I swear I heard him make up on accident on the podcast just a
[06:58.310 --> 07:00.350]  few days before he flew to Colorado.
[07:00.350 --> 07:01.910]  Yeah, he's a fucking pro.
[07:01.910 --> 07:05.510]  And he took that like something like just right now we'd be saying something and he'd
[07:05.510 --> 07:07.350]  be like, Oh my God, dog, that's tremendous dog.
[07:07.350 --> 07:08.590]  I'm writing that shit down dog.
[07:08.590 --> 07:10.870]  And he can make 15 minutes out of it.
[07:10.870 --> 07:11.870]  Brought, yeah.
[07:11.870 --> 07:14.590]  Brought it to us in Denver several days later and ruined the club with it.
[07:14.590 --> 07:18.990]  My stomach and ribs and this part of my jaw right here was sore.
[07:18.990 --> 07:19.990]  I was laughing so hard.
[07:20.610 --> 07:22.090]  I had to tense up my back because it was hurting.
[07:22.090 --> 07:24.570]  I had to move my muscle tension somewhere else.
[07:24.570 --> 07:28.770]  You were sitting back like a little I realized because I was sitting forward on the edge
[07:28.770 --> 07:30.570]  of my seat the whole time.
[07:30.570 --> 07:32.530]  I loved it.
[07:32.530 --> 07:36.050]  And and we I was just sitting forward and just excited.
[07:36.050 --> 07:37.730]  It was so fun.
[07:37.730 --> 07:41.330]  And just every word he was going to say was going to make me laugh.
[07:41.330 --> 07:45.350]  And Jeff said it he goes, Clint, you were laughing harder than anybody else there.
[07:45.350 --> 07:47.390]  It was good because you appreciated the show.
[07:47.390 --> 07:48.930]  And we talked about being a good audience.
[07:48.950 --> 07:50.710]  Clint is a performer and we know what it's like.
[07:50.710 --> 07:53.950]  And I'm a musician, so I know what it's like to have a stale audience.
[07:53.950 --> 07:56.430]  And it wasn't us kissing his ass either.
[07:56.430 --> 07:57.430]  Joey was on fire.
[07:57.430 --> 07:58.430]  Fuck yeah he was.
[07:58.430 --> 08:04.030]  Oh, that was the thing is so we he does about maybe an hour hour and 15 somewhere in there.
[08:04.030 --> 08:05.030]  Yeah.
[08:05.030 --> 08:06.030]  Any any crushes?
[08:06.030 --> 08:09.790]  There was no point in there when I was bored or anything.
[08:09.790 --> 08:12.870]  And then afterwards, we're like, oh, can we meet him?
[08:12.870 --> 08:14.750]  You know, we want to like get backstage.
[08:14.750 --> 08:16.310]  You know, I just want to say thank you.
[08:16.310 --> 08:17.590]  Benson spoiled you too.
[08:17.650 --> 08:19.930]  Well, I took a bunch of weed for Joey Diaz also.
[08:19.930 --> 08:20.930]  I ain't no chump.
[08:20.930 --> 08:23.210]  Yeah, we're going to keep the door.
[08:23.210 --> 08:25.050]  We're going to try to give him a little bit of weed.
[08:25.050 --> 08:29.170]  And so then all of a sudden he he talks to every single person that wants to talk to
[08:29.170 --> 08:30.170]  him.
[08:30.170 --> 08:31.970]  He came out to the hallway of the club and just hung out.
[08:31.970 --> 08:35.450]  The only exit that you could take and he's just standing there and you could shake his
[08:35.450 --> 08:36.450]  hand and get a picture.
[08:36.450 --> 08:39.850]  He took a picture with everybody, everybody, everybody.
[08:39.850 --> 08:43.370]  He asks you your name and then addresses you by name in the conversation.
[08:43.370 --> 08:44.370]  That's so cool.
[08:44.370 --> 08:45.370]  Yeah.
[08:45.370 --> 08:46.370]  He remembers your name for that talk.
[08:46.370 --> 08:47.370]  He's he's that kind of guy.
[08:48.150 --> 08:50.310]  He's like, I'm going to call you D as you know, if he probably still remembers our names.
[08:50.310 --> 08:52.630]  If we see him again, he'd be like, oh, fucking Clint, right?
[08:52.630 --> 08:53.630]  Clint, right?
[08:53.630 --> 08:54.630]  Dog.
[08:54.630 --> 08:55.630]  Because he calls you dog.
[08:55.630 --> 08:56.630]  Every other word is dog and cock sucker.
[08:56.630 --> 09:00.350]  You stand up and out of the crowd just a teeny bit on your own.
[09:00.350 --> 09:01.350]  Yeah.
[09:01.350 --> 09:02.350]  Like it helps that he's cool.
[09:02.350 --> 09:04.510]  But like you guys have an extra little leg up there.
[09:04.510 --> 09:06.110]  You're both memorable on site.
[09:06.110 --> 09:09.510]  We need to get some ski caps, bro, and be Opie and can jacks for Halloween.
[09:09.510 --> 09:12.350]  I can do that, man.
[09:12.350 --> 09:15.950]  I look I'm looking like Ope a little more every day.
[09:15.950 --> 09:16.950]  Every day.
[09:17.530 --> 09:18.530]  I'm going to get my man beard over there, bro.
[09:18.530 --> 09:21.530]  Just got to get my wife killed somehow and then hook up with a prostitute.
[09:21.530 --> 09:22.530]  I'm sad.
[09:22.530 --> 09:25.530]  I'm just kind of awkward silence for a second.
[09:25.530 --> 09:26.530]  I get it.
[09:26.530 --> 09:27.530]  I get it.
[09:27.530 --> 09:31.170]  I'm going to tweet this week about your beard that just crushed me.
[09:31.170 --> 09:34.010]  It was like with a beard like this, you can't be indoors.
[09:34.010 --> 09:37.370]  I spent about five minutes laughing at that.
[09:37.370 --> 09:38.370]  That's sort of true.
[09:38.370 --> 09:44.210]  Like, yeah, you guys, if you find beard trees growing along the Pacific Northwest, Clint
[09:44.210 --> 09:47.430]  was plucking beard hairs out of his beard and throwing them out the window in hopes
[09:47.430 --> 09:49.030]  to plant little beard trees.
[09:49.030 --> 09:50.870]  I'm just trying to get back to the community.
[09:50.870 --> 09:51.870]  Let's know how.
[09:51.870 --> 09:52.870]  Let us know how that worked.
[09:52.870 --> 09:53.870]  If you're in the PNW.
[09:53.870 --> 09:57.630]  Yeah, but we hung out with Joey for probably an hour.
[09:57.630 --> 09:58.630]  Yeah.
[09:58.630 --> 09:59.630]  Afterwards.
[09:59.630 --> 10:00.630]  So everybody hangs out, takes a picture.
[10:00.630 --> 10:05.350]  He taps me on the Joey Diaz taps me on the shoulder and walks away and says, Ross the
[10:05.350 --> 10:06.670]  Jeff, you know, I love you, right?
[10:06.670 --> 10:07.670]  Cocksucker.
[10:07.670 --> 10:08.670]  And I was like, holy shit.
[10:08.670 --> 10:09.950]  You just call me cocksucker.
[10:09.950 --> 10:10.950]  And Clint was smooth about it.
[10:10.950 --> 10:14.250]  He stuck out his hand and wanted that one final like, this is my one on one.
[10:14.250 --> 10:15.930]  He goes, Hey, I'm gonna stand.
[10:15.930 --> 10:16.930]  I'm an open mic comedian.
[10:16.930 --> 10:20.510]  And what you did, I think you told him something about what you did just changed my mic or
[10:20.510 --> 10:21.510]  something like that.
[10:21.510 --> 10:22.730]  Well, it just, it was real inspiring.
[10:22.730 --> 10:23.730]  Yeah.
[10:23.730 --> 10:26.690]  I think I told him and he goes, dog, you're an open mic or dog.
[10:26.690 --> 10:27.690]  Come here, dog.
[10:27.690 --> 10:31.490]  And like, just took like seven steps away from where we were into this little like,
[10:31.490 --> 10:36.010]  kind of just off to the side and be an area and had to talk with Clint about open mic
[10:36.010 --> 10:37.010]  and stand up comedy.
[10:37.010 --> 10:38.010]  Yeah.
[10:38.070 --> 10:40.890]  Do you want to tell him tell the world what they told what he told you or you don't keep
[10:40.890 --> 10:41.890]  that to yourself?
[10:41.890 --> 10:42.970]  No, it was so cool.
[10:42.970 --> 10:46.970]  It was so cool just to have this like one on one with a legend.
[10:46.970 --> 10:47.970]  In my mind, he's a legend.
[10:47.970 --> 10:51.730]  And I you know, I don't get starstruck or stuff like that, because he's a cool fucking
[10:51.730 --> 10:52.730]  guy.
[10:52.730 --> 10:53.730]  And he just he was so personable.
[10:53.730 --> 10:58.050]  But he was just like, dog, you got to write an hour a day.
[10:58.050 --> 10:59.050]  That's all you got to do.
[10:59.050 --> 11:00.850]  Maybe for two weeks, you're not going to get nothing.
[11:00.850 --> 11:03.850]  But you just got to write and you got to write and you got to keep after it.
[11:03.850 --> 11:04.850]  You got to get on stage.
[11:04.850 --> 11:07.850]  And I you know, and I was just sitting there just listening.
[11:08.690 --> 11:10.050]  You know, that's because I'm not trying to tell him anything.
[11:10.050 --> 11:11.050]  I'm just Joey.
[11:11.050 --> 11:12.050]  This is awesome.
[11:12.050 --> 11:14.370]  And then, you know, I was he was trying to get out of there, too.
[11:14.370 --> 11:16.450]  So I was like, I appreciate it, man.
[11:16.450 --> 11:17.450]  We're gonna let you get out of here.
[11:17.450 --> 11:20.090]  I hope you have a great time in Denver.
[11:20.090 --> 11:21.770]  And it was great.
[11:21.770 --> 11:22.770]  He didn't want to leave.
[11:22.770 --> 11:25.290]  He liked hanging out and just having a conversation.
[11:25.290 --> 11:26.290]  You know what I mean?
[11:26.290 --> 11:27.290]  He was like, I got to go, dog.
[11:27.290 --> 11:28.290]  I don't want to.
[11:28.290 --> 11:32.250]  But you can see you can see he was a little tired, but he was just like, God damn, I don't
[11:32.250 --> 11:33.250]  want to leave.
[11:33.250 --> 11:34.330]  He was a great guy.
[11:34.330 --> 11:38.690]  And so if this gets back to Joey Diaz, thank you for the great show.
[11:38.690 --> 11:39.690]  Thanks for hanging out.
[11:39.690 --> 11:41.210]  Thanks for the advice.
[11:41.210 --> 11:42.210]  We love you.
[11:42.210 --> 11:47.450]  And and you got you gained a fan for life by just hanging out for that hour times two.
[11:47.450 --> 11:48.450]  Fuck yeah.
[11:48.450 --> 11:50.850]  And also, thanks for just taking a minute.
[11:50.850 --> 11:51.850]  Like you're a busy dude.
[11:51.850 --> 11:54.250]  We know you had to get to the hotel and smoke that blunt they gave you.
[11:54.250 --> 11:55.250]  Fuck yeah.
[11:55.250 --> 11:56.250]  And those edibles that you got.
[11:56.250 --> 11:57.250]  Eat them chibos.
[11:57.250 --> 11:58.250]  Yeah.
[11:58.250 --> 11:59.570]  So thanks for just hanging out.
[11:59.570 --> 12:00.570]  That's fucking cool.
[12:00.570 --> 12:01.570]  You took a minute.
[12:01.570 --> 12:02.570]  And that means a lot.
[12:02.570 --> 12:03.570]  You're he's been in the longest yard.
[12:03.810 --> 12:04.810]  I know Joe Rogan's podcast.
[12:04.810 --> 12:06.090]  He's got his own podcast.
[12:06.090 --> 12:10.530]  If you can take an ear bashing, if you've got some balls, listen to the church of what's
[12:10.530 --> 12:13.410]  happening now with Joey Coco Diaz and Lisa.
[12:13.410 --> 12:14.410]  It's not for Gentiles.
[12:14.410 --> 12:18.010]  I'll tell you to go fuck yourself on the first episode you listen.
[12:18.010 --> 12:19.010]  So be prepared.
[12:19.010 --> 12:20.770]  But if you can get past that, it's a great show.
[12:20.770 --> 12:21.890]  No, he's funny as shit.
[12:21.890 --> 12:26.810]  And then and if you get a chance to see him live, there's there's if you miss out, you
[12:26.810 --> 12:28.450]  will be you will regret it.
[12:28.450 --> 12:30.010]  If you have an adult diaper, wear one.
[12:30.010 --> 12:31.530]  I wanted to piss my pants.
[12:31.530 --> 12:32.850]  I was laughing so hard.
[12:33.130 --> 12:36.050]  The thing was, I had to piss the whole time he was up there and I was like, I'm not leaving
[12:36.050 --> 12:37.050]  for one moment.
[12:37.050 --> 12:42.130]  Yeah, I will piss myself if I I was so happy to be there.
[12:42.130 --> 12:43.130]  And the tickets were reasonable.
[12:43.130 --> 12:44.970]  We saw him at the Denver Improv.
[12:44.970 --> 12:45.970]  Beautiful club.
[12:45.970 --> 12:46.970]  Beautiful club.
[12:46.970 --> 12:47.970]  I'd love to go back there.
[12:47.970 --> 12:48.970]  We will be back there.
[12:48.970 --> 12:50.050]  Also, we made a new friend that night.
[12:50.050 --> 12:51.050]  His name's Abdullah.
[12:51.050 --> 12:54.890]  Abdullah, you just traveled to Mississippi and I hope you're doing well there, my friend.
[12:54.890 --> 12:56.250]  I hope everything worked out for you.
[12:56.250 --> 12:57.250]  Yeah, brother.
[12:57.250 --> 12:58.250]  Shout out.
[12:58.250 --> 12:59.250]  Find us.
[12:59.250 --> 13:00.250]  Find us on the Internet.
[13:00.250 --> 13:01.250]  Find me on some social media.
[13:01.250 --> 13:02.250]  You said you don't do that.
[13:02.650 --> 13:04.490]  I downloaded the podcast while he was sitting next to us.
[13:04.490 --> 13:06.010]  So there's a good chance he's listening.
[13:06.010 --> 13:07.010]  Find me, bro.
[13:07.010 --> 13:08.010]  Abdullah!
[13:08.010 --> 13:09.010]  What's up, bro?
[13:09.010 --> 13:10.010]  Hope everything worked out.
[13:10.010 --> 13:11.010]  All right.
[13:11.010 --> 13:13.650]  I want to talk about the city council meeting for a minute.
[13:13.650 --> 13:15.210]  But first, I got to do this part.

[14:33.650 --> 14:36.210]  There was a city council meeting on Tuesday.
[14:36.210 --> 14:41.010]  There's some hilarious shit to talk about from that meeting.
[14:41.010 --> 14:42.690]  There's a lot to talk about from that meeting.
[14:42.690 --> 14:46.650]  What part caught you as hilarious?
[14:46.650 --> 14:50.890]  So I go to every city council meeting for the most part.
[14:50.890 --> 14:51.890]  Everybody there knows me.
[14:51.890 --> 14:56.210]  I'm used to the police chief and the fire chief and the city manager and the city attorney
[14:56.210 --> 15:01.570]  and the council members coming up and saying hi or waving or giving me two minutes to talk
[15:01.570 --> 15:04.810]  to them about whatever.
[15:04.810 --> 15:07.610]  Not everybody in our community is.
[15:07.610 --> 15:09.890]  I was sort of early to the meeting.
[15:09.890 --> 15:11.810]  I had signed up to speak.
[15:11.810 --> 15:17.010]  And from the seat I usually sit in, I can't see the doors that people walk in from, but
[15:17.010 --> 15:23.930]  I can see the city staff and the city council real well, and they're kind of milling around
[15:23.930 --> 15:25.770]  waiting for the meeting to start.
[15:25.770 --> 15:29.410]  And their decorum all just, they freeze.
[15:29.410 --> 15:34.050]  Like when somebody, I don't know, runs through a room naked and the rest of the well-dressed
[15:34.050 --> 15:38.770]  people go, wait, did that just happen and everybody freezes for a second?
[15:38.770 --> 15:39.930]  Everybody froze for a second.
[15:39.930 --> 15:46.530]  So I swivel my head and I see two and a quarter sets of dreadlocks walk in the door.
[15:47.050 --> 15:51.250]  Jeff and two supporters he brought to the meeting.
[15:51.250 --> 15:52.610]  I don't know if they want to be named.
[15:52.610 --> 15:53.610]  Oh yeah, they're supporters.
[15:53.610 --> 15:54.610]  Thanks for coming guys.
[15:54.610 --> 15:57.170]  Adam and Angela, thank you guys a lot for joining me to the city council meeting.
[15:57.170 --> 15:58.170]  Your numbers made a difference.
[15:58.170 --> 15:59.450]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[15:59.450 --> 16:00.450]  Thank you very much for coming.
[16:00.450 --> 16:03.690]  But yeah, as you guys walked in, everybody was sort of like, what?
[16:03.690 --> 16:06.490]  Is it city council?
[16:06.490 --> 16:09.570]  Two people were Jedi staring me, dude.
[16:09.570 --> 16:14.410]  I could feel one guy's eyes cooking a hole through my shirt and reading my soul.
[16:14.770 --> 16:15.770]  I was like, hi.
[16:15.770 --> 16:17.530]  I looked at him and nodded like, uh-huh.
[16:17.530 --> 16:18.530]  I'm not sure why you're staring.
[16:18.530 --> 16:19.530]  Like, this is weird.
[16:19.530 --> 16:21.210]  Am I translucent right now?
[16:21.210 --> 16:22.210]  Yeah.
[16:22.210 --> 16:23.210]  Has he seen a ghost?
[16:23.210 --> 16:26.330]  And so people start speaking and I go, I look at them while they speak, right?
[16:26.330 --> 16:29.090]  And then I get the creepy feeling again and I look to my left and that dude is like this
[16:29.090 --> 16:30.090]  at me.
[16:30.090 --> 16:32.810]  And for the listeners, it's an intense stare, but like this.
[16:32.810 --> 16:35.570]  Just intense and sort of angry, flat faced.
[16:35.570 --> 16:36.570]  Yeah.
[16:36.570 --> 16:37.570]  And I had never met the man.
[16:37.570 --> 16:39.730]  I've never met the man.
[16:39.730 --> 16:42.130]  I know him enough to like say hi and shake his hand.
[16:42.850 --> 16:45.410]  The city manager could not stop staring at you.
[16:45.410 --> 16:50.050]  There's another guy who fits the exact description of rich white guys.
[16:50.050 --> 16:51.450]  Like rich white councilmen.
[16:51.450 --> 16:52.450]  He's who you'd think of.
[16:52.450 --> 16:54.850]  If I saw him, I'd go, yeah, city council guy, run some shit.
[16:54.850 --> 16:56.410]  Oh, the city attorney.
[16:56.410 --> 17:00.730]  The city manager looked at him and goes, who's the guy in the hat?
[17:00.730 --> 17:03.650]  I saw him say it like he didn't care that I was watching him.
[17:03.650 --> 17:05.170]  It was kind of awkward.
[17:05.170 --> 17:06.170]  That was funny.
[17:06.170 --> 17:09.250]  Through the whole meeting, he kept staring at my little group of people.
[17:09.370 --> 17:12.610]  So in a city council meeting, they do, they have a little structure.
[17:12.610 --> 17:14.490]  They have their agenda meeting right at the beginning.
[17:14.490 --> 17:19.490]  And then they have like a little, they say the pledge of allegiance and they pray.
[17:19.490 --> 17:24.650]  And then they open up the floor and they say, they do public comment.
[17:24.650 --> 17:28.530]  And then right after that, they say thank you, or they do city contributions or something.
[17:28.530 --> 17:29.530]  They called it.
[17:29.530 --> 17:32.890]  They call it public forum where anyone from the public can speak for five minutes.
[17:32.890 --> 17:36.490]  And then they have council commentary right after that, where any of the council members.
[17:36.490 --> 17:39.210]  There was a part right before that where the lady goes, this is the part where we're going
[17:40.170 --> 17:42.850]  to say thanks to the people that have contributed to the community.
[17:42.850 --> 17:43.850]  Last week we did 101.
[17:43.850 --> 17:46.330]  Luckily, there are none this week.
[17:46.330 --> 17:50.370]  My little group chuckled and I go, huh, no shout outs on the episode this week was what
[17:50.370 --> 17:53.290]  I said, because I thought that was funny.
[17:53.290 --> 17:56.570]  So like Mike said, after that, they let each council member speak.
[17:56.570 --> 17:59.610]  So the first council member speaks and he's like, so first off, I want to say thanks to
[17:59.610 --> 18:00.970]  this person and this person.
[18:00.970 --> 18:01.970]  And I chuckled a little bit.
[18:01.970 --> 18:03.010]  I was like, huh?
[18:03.010 --> 18:05.450]  And the next one is like, I want to say thanks to this person.
[18:05.450 --> 18:07.330]  So five people in a row go.
[18:07.330 --> 18:09.090]  And they all basically did shout outs.
[18:09.970 --> 18:10.970]  And by the fourth one, I giggled.
[18:10.970 --> 18:11.970]  I giggled out loud.
[18:11.970 --> 18:14.650]  And the girl next to me, Angela giggled.
[18:14.650 --> 18:16.050]  And then Adam leaned over and giggled.
[18:16.050 --> 18:18.410]  And we were all just like church giggling.
[18:18.410 --> 18:19.730]  And Angela had the balls to say it.
[18:19.730 --> 18:21.250]  She goes, shout outs.
[18:21.250 --> 18:23.370]  And we just couldn't even handle ourselves anymore.
[18:23.370 --> 18:24.370]  It was so funny.
[18:24.370 --> 18:29.530]  Even Montoya wasn't at this meeting, but her little council commentary for most of the
[18:29.530 --> 18:32.690]  meetings is.
[18:32.690 --> 18:35.490]  It's blander than any advertising you've ever heard.
[18:36.210 --> 18:40.090]  It's almost a bulletin board reading session for a bunch of random local events.
[18:40.090 --> 18:44.490]  I mean, her shout outs are always come to the Pinewood Derby or come down to the softball
[18:44.490 --> 18:47.010]  game next week or we're doing an Eastside Park cleanup.
[18:47.010 --> 18:49.210]  Like super duper simple shout outs.
[18:49.210 --> 18:50.690]  It's kind of fun to watch every week.
[18:50.690 --> 18:52.610]  The city council does some shout outs, bro.
[18:52.610 --> 18:54.890]  There's like 20 minutes of solid like a big shout out.
[18:54.890 --> 18:58.570]  And one person goes, and also thanks to make it parks and rec and kept going.
[18:58.570 --> 19:00.170]  And I was like, oh, they just shut it off.
[19:00.170 --> 19:01.170]  Parks and Rec.
[19:01.170 --> 19:02.770]  They did it like a real shout out.
[19:02.770 --> 19:04.010]  It was really fucking funny.
[19:04.010 --> 19:05.010]  So I thought that was hilarious.
[19:05.010 --> 19:06.010]  Hilarious.
[19:06.010 --> 19:10.930]  If you're there watching, it's a play like anything you would buy tickets to see.
[19:10.930 --> 19:13.850]  It's just about stuff that's usually really boring.
[19:13.850 --> 19:15.610]  This may get me in trouble, but it's really funny.
[19:15.610 --> 19:18.690]  I don't even know if I should say this.
[19:18.690 --> 19:23.490]  You have to address the president of city council as Madam President.
[19:23.490 --> 19:24.690]  You don't have to.
[19:24.690 --> 19:27.050]  It's not required.
[19:27.050 --> 19:29.250]  The city staff do it out of respect.
[19:29.250 --> 19:31.570]  Like you call it a very condescending tone.
[19:32.010 --> 19:34.130]  They are very condescending tone.
[19:34.130 --> 19:37.330]  They give a couple of them were like, yes, fucking Madam fucking president.
[19:38.090 --> 19:40.650]  It was like what they should have said.
[19:40.650 --> 19:42.610]  They I owe a dollar.
[19:42.610 --> 19:43.930]  I owe five dollars.
[19:43.930 --> 19:45.650]  Actually, it's all my God.
[19:45.650 --> 19:48.170]  I wasn't going to stop you earlier because you were on a roll.
[19:48.170 --> 19:49.450]  Somebody count them up, guys.
[19:49.450 --> 19:50.370]  Somebody count them up.
[19:50.370 --> 19:51.210]  I'm going to pay that guy.
[19:51.210 --> 19:53.570]  I promise. Thirty five dollars per episode on this one.
[19:53.570 --> 19:54.650]  Any of it. It's all right.
[19:54.650 --> 19:55.970]  I promised it. It's going to happen.
[19:55.970 --> 19:56.770]  I love it.
[19:56.770 --> 19:57.650]  May have to.
[19:57.650 --> 19:59.890]  They have to come after nature's green remedies, get the refill.
[19:59.890 --> 20:00.850]  But it'll happen.
[20:00.850 --> 20:06.170]  Yeah. Well, there's been quite a bit of controversy and like, I don't know.
[20:07.130 --> 20:10.570]  Friction, I suppose you'd call it between the city council and city staff
[20:10.570 --> 20:14.050]  and members of city council a couple of months ago, the council commentary
[20:14.050 --> 20:17.730]  thing was like the politest book, you know, book you that you have ever heard.
[20:19.090 --> 20:22.210]  One of the city councilmen was in the paper saying stuff
[20:22.210 --> 20:24.410]  two or three of the other ones was doing was illegal.
[20:24.410 --> 20:27.170]  And he kept using the phrase shadow government.
[20:27.170 --> 20:29.610]  And like they were ready.
[20:29.610 --> 20:33.010]  Like I seriously was waiting for him to rise up with ice picks,
[20:33.010 --> 20:35.810]  like as soon as they cut the camera feed one night,
[20:37.130 --> 20:38.730]  the cameras are gone. Step, step, step.
[20:38.730 --> 20:41.450]  Oh, I was sitting in a seat where I could hear the whole production crew, too.
[20:41.450 --> 20:44.530]  That was really a privilege being a nerd like loving tech gear.
[20:44.530 --> 20:46.090]  I was loving it. Oh, yeah.
[20:46.090 --> 20:47.250]  I could see all the sound equipment.
[20:47.250 --> 20:49.170]  I could hear the camera crew behind me. It was awesome.
[20:49.170 --> 20:51.130]  They're in that there's one door between me and them.
[20:51.130 --> 20:53.850]  And you could hear them five, four, three.
[20:54.850 --> 20:57.210]  We're live. It was just neat watching it.
[20:57.650 --> 20:59.610]  I picked those seats for a reason.
[20:59.610 --> 21:00.810]  I posted a picture.
[21:00.810 --> 21:03.290]  I posted a picture on Instagram of myself.
[21:03.730 --> 21:06.250]  That was on the I was on the news and someone's like, dude, you look paranoid.
[21:06.530 --> 21:11.170]  Actually, that facial expression was when the city council
[21:11.410 --> 21:13.690]  president announced her resignation.
[21:13.690 --> 21:14.810]  That's the face I made.
[21:14.810 --> 21:16.810]  That's the moment that that picture was taken.
[21:16.850 --> 21:19.650]  I can't believe they used you and Angela as the reaction
[21:20.050 --> 21:22.610]  footage for that shot, though, like the whole room went.
[21:23.250 --> 21:25.570]  Yeah, they were like, oh, get the dreadlocks.
[21:25.610 --> 21:30.450]  Get a lot of the guy working the camera was one of my best friends from high school.
[21:30.530 --> 21:32.970]  Nice. Yeah, we played in a band together in 1998.
[21:33.050 --> 21:35.370]  So, yeah, he knew me. He walked up and said hello.
[21:35.490 --> 21:38.490]  It was really fun being in the council meeting and a newscaster in a suit
[21:38.490 --> 21:41.090]  walks up. Oh, hi, Jeff. Good to see you.
[21:41.090 --> 21:45.210]  Yeah, I think it's the same newscaster that tried to get an interview with me after.
[21:45.370 --> 21:48.810]  Probably. He talked to you for a minute during in there, but you were you were kind of
[21:48.810 --> 21:49.770]  you got shooken up, dude.
[21:49.770 --> 21:51.170]  You get a little nervous right before you speak.
[21:51.170 --> 21:52.290]  You go in tunnel vision.
[21:52.290 --> 21:55.850]  Speaking so much, but it's sorted by default.
[21:55.850 --> 22:00.330]  I am the guy that has to stand up and speak because I've got squeaky clean everything.
[22:00.330 --> 22:01.730]  You've got the college education.
[22:01.730 --> 22:03.530]  You got the good vocabulary.
[22:03.530 --> 22:05.010]  I've got the dreadlocks in the beard.
[22:05.010 --> 22:05.930]  They don't want to talk to me.
[22:05.930 --> 22:08.010]  They they stared me down just sitting in council.
[22:08.010 --> 22:09.850]  If I would have walked up there, then you got five minutes
[22:09.850 --> 22:11.730]  and they would have pulled out their phones and just started tweeting.
[22:12.970 --> 22:16.370]  And if I went up there, they'd be like, we're not going to let the guy with the felony
[22:16.370 --> 22:17.530]  come on. Exactly.
[22:17.530 --> 22:19.810]  And let let the security stand up a little closer, please.
[22:19.970 --> 22:25.050]  Yeah. So city council meeting, Mike went and spoke against the proposed
[22:25.210 --> 22:27.530]  ordinance that was coming up.
[22:28.770 --> 22:31.690]  We you want to tell us how that went so that I don't have to fumble through it.
[22:31.690 --> 22:32.290]  Fumble through.
[22:33.610 --> 22:37.650]  The proposed ordinance is still sitting at the planning and zoning level.
[22:37.690 --> 22:41.610]  They are what's called a recommending body.
[22:42.570 --> 22:46.730]  They suggest things to the city council and the city council can
[22:47.410 --> 22:52.330]  go run with that idea or have them amend that idea in some way
[22:52.330 --> 22:54.850]  or they can kill it all together.
[22:54.850 --> 22:58.890]  Usually city council tells planning and zoning like, hey, we'd like to see this.
[22:58.890 --> 23:00.130]  And then they go work on that.
[23:00.130 --> 23:03.610]  It's my understanding that this is not that kind of ordinance.
[23:03.610 --> 23:07.210]  This is something planning and zoning has been working on as their own effort
[23:07.730 --> 23:11.650]  to sort of show city council as a way to solve some of the complaints
[23:11.650 --> 23:12.650]  they've been receiving.
[23:13.330 --> 23:16.570]  And essentially planning and zoning is fired up
[23:16.570 --> 23:18.890]  because people can see and smell pot.
[23:18.890 --> 23:22.450]  And that's bad as far as they're concerned.
[23:22.530 --> 23:25.690]  And they would like to come up with rules and regulations
[23:25.690 --> 23:27.890]  so that no one ever sees or smells pot.
[23:28.490 --> 23:33.930]  And if you're trying to grow your own marijuana or know someone that is,
[23:33.930 --> 23:37.810]  you can see how problematic that might become if you've got to get it
[23:37.810 --> 23:41.450]  all the way back out of sight and out of mind and you can't do that in your own home.
[23:43.050 --> 23:46.770]  The problems with this ordinance sort of spin out of control real rapidly.
[23:46.770 --> 23:51.730]  And we, as far as the community goes, I think don't like it on every
[23:52.010 --> 23:53.930]  every part of it is bad.
[23:53.930 --> 23:57.050]  And so we tried to rally people with the last episode
[23:57.050 --> 23:59.290]  and a couple of other things to get down to the meeting.
[23:59.770 --> 24:03.490]  And this time we had a pretty good show of support at the city council meeting
[24:03.490 --> 24:04.450]  on Tuesday night.
[24:05.450 --> 24:10.130]  I spoke during public forum and sort of pleaded with them to think about
[24:10.130 --> 24:13.010]  how many people in the city they're affecting with these rules,
[24:13.010 --> 24:16.890]  how many people's rights under Amendment 20 or Amendment 64
[24:16.890 --> 24:19.050]  would be restricted by these rules.
[24:19.050 --> 24:21.850]  I mean, now all of a sudden you've got roommates trying to figure out
[24:22.130 --> 24:25.170]  who gets to exercise their constitutional rights and who doesn't,
[24:25.170 --> 24:28.850]  because you can only exercise so many of them at one time in a home with a plan.
[24:28.850 --> 24:31.850]  And Mike showed up with statistics and counts.
[24:32.130 --> 24:35.490]  He told the city council how many patients there are in the city and county.
[24:35.730 --> 24:37.850]  He told them how many of them have a caregiver.
[24:38.090 --> 24:41.410]  He told them how much it cost to make a facility like they're required.
[24:41.530 --> 24:44.730]  Yeah. Most of the people that spoke at city council, the city council
[24:44.730 --> 24:47.330]  kind of gave them the look of, yeah, we've heard this before.
[24:47.330 --> 24:49.530]  And you're back again this week. Thanks. Gotcha.
[24:49.850 --> 24:53.770]  When Mike spoke, they all kind of sat up and they actually leaned forward and
[24:53.770 --> 24:56.530]  listened. I was paying more attention to their faces and just listened to Mike.
[24:57.210 --> 24:59.450]  It they like it when I speak.
[24:59.730 --> 25:02.570]  A number of council members have told me, like, thanks for having
[25:02.570 --> 25:06.210]  like some data to back up what you're saying or taking the time to read.
[25:06.210 --> 25:07.930]  You can tell that made a difference.
[25:07.930 --> 25:11.810]  They they get a lot of rambling at them and like angry rambling.
[25:11.810 --> 25:14.090]  And, you know, you're fired up and you're passionate.
[25:14.130 --> 25:16.970]  I'm not I'm not a big fan of public speaking.
[25:16.970 --> 25:18.170]  It makes me incredibly nervous.
[25:18.170 --> 25:20.570]  Honestly, I we did our best to calm you down.
[25:20.610 --> 25:21.890]  You said I'm nervous as shit.
[25:21.890 --> 25:23.090]  And so we just started talking to him.
[25:23.090 --> 25:26.090]  So I'm all sweaty and think about bacon.
[25:26.130 --> 25:27.890]  Yeah, just to focus out of it.
[25:27.890 --> 25:31.250]  And but somebody has got to do it.
[25:31.250 --> 25:33.370]  And I've been the one that's been biting that bullet lately.
[25:33.370 --> 25:36.450]  So I went down Tuesday night and said my piece.
[25:36.450 --> 25:39.850]  And honestly, like usually when people bring supporters down for their issue,
[25:39.850 --> 25:44.050]  like lately when the trash haulers speak, there's like five or ten trash
[25:44.050 --> 25:47.010]  haulers behind them that really take a minute to cheer and clap
[25:47.850 --> 25:51.130]  as soon as the whoever's gotten up to speak is done speaking.
[25:51.130 --> 25:55.250]  And I half expected what were there, six or seven people behind us?
[25:55.450 --> 25:56.570]  Yeah, maybe eight.
[25:56.570 --> 25:58.850]  I'd say there's about eight of us, eight plus us.
[25:59.410 --> 26:02.690]  I wasn't sure how well I did when I get up and I start giving a speech.
[26:02.690 --> 26:07.730]  Honestly, I go into a weird little zone where I know what kind of what I'm saying
[26:07.730 --> 26:10.930]  and I'm prepared to say, you know, something specific.
[26:10.930 --> 26:13.450]  But once I get up and start talking,
[26:13.450 --> 26:17.050]  there isn't a filter between like brain Mike and mouth Mike.
[26:17.090 --> 26:20.570]  There's nobody being like, don't cuss or make sure you emphasize this.
[26:20.570 --> 26:22.450]  It's all the best. There's too much adrenaline.
[26:22.450 --> 26:24.410]  Did you realize what you said at the end?
[26:24.410 --> 26:26.130]  You stood up and you said, thank you for my time.
[26:26.130 --> 26:27.890]  And you walked away from.
[26:30.570 --> 26:32.090]  I mean, that's the perfect example.
[26:32.090 --> 26:34.130]  Like my heart's pounding so fast and there's so much.
[26:34.130 --> 26:36.210]  They knew what you meant. They knew what you meant.
[26:36.210 --> 26:38.410]  I know what you meant. You meant, hey, you're welcome.
[26:38.610 --> 26:40.210]  Yes. Yeah, essentially.
[26:40.210 --> 26:41.610]  Like that's you're welcome.
[26:41.610 --> 26:44.290]  I know you don't have time to Google this. Did it for you.
[26:44.290 --> 26:47.170]  So by by coming out and showing support and by you speaking.
[26:47.290 --> 26:50.890]  And there was another guy that went to another meeting who spoke about his family
[26:50.890 --> 26:53.210]  and how this was affecting them in such a traumatic way.
[26:54.890 --> 26:56.530]  Do you did you guys make a difference?
[26:56.530 --> 26:57.810]  Did we all make a difference?
[26:57.810 --> 27:00.330]  It's you said it's been curved for a while.
[27:00.610 --> 27:07.690]  Um, OK, guys, so Monday we had a city meeting or starting Monday or since Monday.
[27:08.130 --> 27:11.410]  We've had a city council meeting, a planning and zoning meeting
[27:11.410 --> 27:15.450]  and a county commissioner's meeting at each one of those three meetings.
[27:15.450 --> 27:19.370]  They were discussing rules that would take away your ability to grow in your own home,
[27:19.690 --> 27:23.290]  limit the amount of plants you're you're growing to an arbitrary number
[27:23.290 --> 27:24.650]  that they just picked.
[27:24.650 --> 27:26.810]  They decided that ought to be enough. Good enough.
[27:26.810 --> 27:30.130]  We'll cap it at 12 in the city or 16 or 18 in the county.
[27:31.170 --> 27:34.170]  And if you live up in Bula and have 400 acres
[27:34.610 --> 27:38.330]  and all of that's one property, you can only grow 18 plants there.
[27:38.730 --> 27:41.770]  It doesn't matter how many different residents are set up on your property.
[27:41.770 --> 27:44.330]  And none of that. I mean, there's just really terrible rules.
[27:44.730 --> 27:46.770]  So the community kind of tried to rally.
[27:46.770 --> 27:48.130]  We did the podcast episode.
[27:48.130 --> 27:51.850]  There was another community meeting at the Daily Grind.
[27:51.890 --> 27:55.050]  There's another one tomorrow at four o'clock if anyone wants to come on Friday.
[27:55.090 --> 27:56.850]  This is going to drop to four o'clock.
[27:56.850 --> 27:59.290]  This will go up till Monday morning. So never mind.
[27:59.410 --> 28:01.690]  It's already you guys are late. Sorry, guys.
[28:01.690 --> 28:02.770]  You guys didn't show up.
[28:02.770 --> 28:05.490]  Were you guys waiting on you to go back in time?
[28:05.490 --> 28:07.650]  I'm all dabbed and started thinking this. That's right.
[28:08.050 --> 28:10.330]  We can put this out tomorrow if we wanted.
[28:11.010 --> 28:13.050]  We just have to record another one for Sunday.
[28:13.050 --> 28:17.810]  But the progress we made to get everybody that could make it made it.
[28:17.850 --> 28:21.970]  Everybody that felt like they wanted to speak spoke.
[28:22.690 --> 28:27.130]  I met the gentleman who was quoted in the Chieftain, who is a young guy,
[28:27.170 --> 28:29.650]  is a little younger than me. I'd say he's maybe twenty five.
[28:29.850 --> 28:31.450]  He's got a wife who's sick.
[28:31.450 --> 28:35.090]  He's got a mother in law who's sick and he's got a child with cancer
[28:35.530 --> 28:37.650]  and he's their caregiver.
[28:37.650 --> 28:39.570]  He has a job where he can't consume.
[28:39.570 --> 28:43.130]  So he's just taking care of them in his testimony.
[28:43.690 --> 28:47.050]  I mean, it was like I was throwing spitballs and he rolled up in a tank.
[28:47.410 --> 28:51.250]  Like they they heard what I had to say at all three meetings.
[28:51.250 --> 28:53.650]  And they appreciated me coming down and saying my piece.
[28:53.650 --> 28:56.970]  But when he got up and spoke, they hit the brakes.
[28:57.010 --> 29:00.010]  Hard. And also you opened up for this guy
[29:01.410 --> 29:02.290]  and he was the headliner.
[29:02.290 --> 29:04.210]  He was the headliner. Essentially, yes.
[29:04.850 --> 29:06.570]  So what's come of your guys's work?
[29:06.570 --> 29:07.970]  Did they stop it?
[29:07.970 --> 29:09.930]  Did they hesitate? Are they going to rework it?
[29:09.930 --> 29:15.450]  The county is they delayed the vote again to do more research.
[29:18.290 --> 29:20.930]  I think for two weeks, maybe three.
[29:21.010 --> 29:23.050]  Watch the county commissioner's website.
[29:23.050 --> 29:24.770]  They post their agendas on Fridays.
[29:24.770 --> 29:27.770]  Usually their meetings are usually Tuesdays.
[29:27.770 --> 29:29.650]  So you get about five days to check it out.
[29:29.650 --> 29:31.090]  And a heads up.
[29:32.010 --> 29:35.810]  The city has the planning and zoning commission
[29:36.250 --> 29:40.770]  delayed presenting this plan to city council by two months.
[29:40.970 --> 29:44.370]  Nice. And they have given those that came to speak at the planning
[29:44.370 --> 29:47.570]  and zoning meeting a seat at the table while these rules get reworked.
[29:47.890 --> 29:50.930]  So a couple of us that came to speak against and a couple of people
[29:50.930 --> 29:54.370]  that came to speak for will be sitting at the table while these get redone.
[29:54.410 --> 29:56.010]  That's something I kind of wanted to ask you.
[29:56.010 --> 30:00.730]  That is Hugh. You said at when you address city council, you actually said,
[30:00.730 --> 30:03.690]  guys, please find somebody that knows what they're talking about.
[30:03.690 --> 30:05.250]  When you do this, you look them straight in the face.
[30:05.250 --> 30:06.770]  You're like, you guys don't know anything about weed.
[30:06.770 --> 30:09.410]  Please find somebody that knows what they're talking about.
[30:09.410 --> 30:11.250]  And put them on your committee.
[30:11.250 --> 30:15.290]  I almost considered volunteering or asking you how I get to be a part of that
[30:15.290 --> 30:18.730]  because I am a legal grower and I'm a caregiver.
[30:18.730 --> 30:21.290]  I'm not a black market guy. I think I can set a good example.
[30:21.650 --> 30:26.490]  It's more than once I've fantasized about being able to kidnap and hood
[30:26.490 --> 30:29.690]  a member of city government, like sneak them through your backyard and be like,
[30:29.690 --> 30:31.890]  this is what it looks like when it's done right.
[30:31.890 --> 30:33.410]  This is what legal looks like.
[30:33.410 --> 30:35.530]  This is what following the rules looks like.
[30:35.530 --> 30:39.450]  Yeah, because unless you've blown your house up or you've set your garage on fire,
[30:39.450 --> 30:44.010]  overloaded a transformer behind your house, they've never come to your home.
[30:44.010 --> 30:45.810]  That was Mike's main point to city council.
[30:45.810 --> 30:48.970]  He said the guys you're messing with are not the medical caregivers.
[30:48.970 --> 30:51.210]  Those are commercial growers that are making a weed crop.
[30:51.210 --> 30:54.730]  You're making those rules to enforce upon medical caregivers
[30:54.730 --> 30:56.490]  and you're totally missing the point.
[30:56.490 --> 30:57.330]  And I think they caught on.
[30:57.330 --> 30:59.610]  I think we've got more time to deal with it.
[30:59.610 --> 31:02.890]  So get on that committee, work it out, let them know.
[31:03.130 --> 31:05.730]  Like there's a handful of us that are scrambling.
[31:05.730 --> 31:09.210]  If you're listening to this show and you are interested in cannabis advocacy,
[31:09.530 --> 31:13.930]  you can find me on Twitter, Nemo Punk 15, just like it sounds.
[31:14.050 --> 31:20.010]  Any MOP on K one five or I just created a Facebook page with somebody else
[31:20.010 --> 31:21.050]  at one of the meetings brought up.
[31:21.050 --> 31:24.690]  It'd be great if we had a Facebook page where we could kind of kick out
[31:24.690 --> 31:28.930]  community activism info and organize people for when the meetings are,
[31:28.930 --> 31:30.770]  because all of that can be very confusing.
[31:31.290 --> 31:35.610]  And I know we're in an anti Facebook mood, but I feel kind of bad
[31:35.610 --> 31:37.450]  because I spaced the name of the freaking face.
[31:37.490 --> 31:39.050]  You can't remember your own Facebook page.
[31:39.050 --> 31:43.130]  I'm pretty sure it's a sensible cannabis laws or cannabis regulation.
[31:43.130 --> 31:44.530]  I remember how I was at the end of the night.
[31:44.810 --> 31:45.410]  I saw it the other night.
[31:45.410 --> 31:46.810]  I'm pretty sure that I don't have a dad.
[31:46.810 --> 31:48.610]  But right now there's one in arm's reach.
[31:48.610 --> 31:49.450]  So let up right now.
[31:49.450 --> 31:51.210]  Let me raise her further than they should be.
[31:51.250 --> 31:52.210]  Let me let me cut you off.
[31:52.210 --> 31:55.490]  I know that for the listeners, this might sound like if you're out of state
[31:55.490 --> 31:59.490]  or if you're out of Pueblo, like this is not like you're you're like, oh, man,
[31:59.490 --> 32:01.450]  these guys are just talking about hometown stuff.
[32:01.450 --> 32:04.330]  You guys got to watch those city councilmen wherever you're at.
[32:05.090 --> 32:10.090]  I local politics is interesting because it's the stuff that most affects you.
[32:10.450 --> 32:13.690]  So you should be kind of keeping an eye on your local council anyway.
[32:13.690 --> 32:17.090]  And B, if you're trying to legalize marijuana on any level,
[32:17.130 --> 32:21.210]  getting the people that are elected right above you is the place to start.
[32:22.010 --> 32:24.130]  Yeah. So that was more what I wanted to say.
[32:24.130 --> 32:27.570]  I know that there's probably some people like, oh, because I know I was.
[32:29.410 --> 32:31.090]  No, I just wanted to speed them up.
[32:31.090 --> 32:32.930]  I know I didn't you see me?
[32:32.930 --> 32:35.010]  I kept rambling and I keep going back.
[32:35.010 --> 32:36.050]  Yeah, you were cranking him.
[32:36.050 --> 32:37.850]  I thought only a little bit trying to get it going.
[32:37.890 --> 32:39.650]  Little throttle.
[32:40.370 --> 32:42.570]  So Mike mentioned we're in an F Facebook mode.
[32:43.890 --> 32:45.250]  I'm I read genetics.
[32:45.250 --> 32:46.450]  I had you face.
[32:46.450 --> 32:48.930]  I had five thousand.
[32:48.930 --> 32:52.490]  Five thousand Facebook friends and I had close to seven to ten thousand
[32:52.490 --> 32:55.290]  and pay attention to the number there, about seven to ten thousand followers.
[32:55.890 --> 32:58.410]  And Facebook decided to close my damn page.
[32:58.410 --> 33:00.010]  Fuck you, Facebook.
[33:00.010 --> 33:02.170]  Eat it, Facebook. God damn it.
[33:02.170 --> 33:03.930]  I haven't. That was Clint over there with the F's.
[33:03.930 --> 33:05.730]  So charge him the five. Not me, please. Don't know.
[33:06.410 --> 33:08.970]  Shit. Just don't confuse the voices.
[33:08.970 --> 33:10.810]  But Facebook, dude, come on, bro.
[33:10.810 --> 33:12.610]  Eat a dick. Why did you do that to me?
[33:12.610 --> 33:15.090]  Come on. Come on.
[33:15.170 --> 33:17.370]  So I'm not on Facebook as much as I used to be.
[33:17.370 --> 33:20.650]  I was just going to go look for Mike's Facebook page and then I log into Facebook
[33:20.650 --> 33:23.410]  and all I can do is look at shit that people that have liked my shit.
[33:23.410 --> 33:25.690]  I can't really go comment. I can't like I can't post.
[33:25.730 --> 33:27.770]  Oh, because I can post. But yeah. Yeah.
[33:27.770 --> 33:29.530]  But I can't let go comment. I can't troll.
[33:29.530 --> 33:31.970]  Yeah. And have to find it being on Facebook is being a troll
[33:32.170 --> 33:33.570]  and you can't go troll people anymore.
[33:33.570 --> 33:35.410]  So you won't see that Facebook
[33:35.410 --> 33:38.690]  but you know, sensible cannabis laws is the page that I created.
[33:38.890 --> 33:40.050]  Check it out on Facebook.
[33:40.050 --> 33:42.090]  We're rocking out at like eight likes right now.
[33:42.090 --> 33:43.090]  We're happy about that.
[33:45.010 --> 33:46.410]  You'll get there. It takes a minute.
[33:46.450 --> 33:47.170]  I'm not all there.
[33:47.170 --> 33:50.650]  I figure it'll be about a year or two before it starts really rolling.
[33:50.650 --> 33:52.410]  And as soon as it does, they'll take it away.
[33:54.050 --> 33:55.210]  Don't give them the password.
[33:55.210 --> 33:59.130]  Fuck them. If you are on Facebook, though, check out Wild Cousins.
[33:59.130 --> 34:00.850]  Wild Cousins is my comedy crew.
[34:00.850 --> 34:03.530]  We do comedy in Pueblo and Southern Colorado.
[34:03.890 --> 34:05.930]  Wild Cousins on Facebook.
[34:05.930 --> 34:08.850]  Just like it sounds. Wild Cousins, a bunch of inbreds getting crazy.
[34:08.850 --> 34:10.690]  You've got damn straight.
[34:10.690 --> 34:12.770]  I'm the only white one.
[34:13.210 --> 34:14.610]  So I just have to do it to myself.
[34:14.610 --> 34:15.890]  It's definitely a Pueblo show.
[34:17.530 --> 34:19.770]  Speaking of Pueblo, this podcast is brought to you by Hygro

[34:44.210 --> 34:46.970]  You just go over the tracks and then merge and park and you're there pretty much.
[34:47.010 --> 34:51.090]  Yeah, just a little tiny, tiny shop, but they'll get you whatever you want.
[34:51.130 --> 34:51.890]  They will order it.
[34:51.890 --> 34:54.730]  They've got plenty of room to stock it in the back until you come pick it up.

[35:04.930 --> 35:06.770]  They said they're working on a special for me.
[35:06.770 --> 35:08.330]  They don't know what they're going to do yet,
[35:08.330 --> 35:11.210]  but get in there and tell them that you're listening to the show
[35:11.210 --> 35:13.330]  while we're at it. Big love to Tree Thugger dot com.

[35:37.010 --> 35:38.850]  All right. That's enough commercials.
[35:38.850 --> 35:40.370]  I like doing the commercials in the middle.
[35:40.370 --> 35:42.770]  You don't like overload them at the start.
[35:42.770 --> 35:46.690]  I think listeners should like if you listen to a lot of podcasts like I do,
[35:47.210 --> 35:48.490]  I like that you break it up.
[35:48.490 --> 35:50.410]  It's like, you know what? We're going to talk for a little bit.
[35:50.410 --> 35:52.530]  We're going to get off that subject. Here's some more commercials.
[35:52.530 --> 35:54.690]  It's like watching TV or something.
[35:54.690 --> 35:57.170]  I learned to do them at the beginning like Rogan does.
[35:57.170 --> 36:00.450]  Yeah, because if I prefer you don't, but if you want to,
[36:00.450 --> 36:01.610]  you can just skip right through them.
[36:01.610 --> 36:03.050]  You just go about two minutes in.
[36:03.050 --> 36:06.490]  You're right past all the Rogan's five minutes unless he gets on an on it.
[36:06.490 --> 36:08.130]  Fucking
[36:08.450 --> 36:12.770]  dude. So if you look on my table, I've not been paid for this yet,
[36:12.770 --> 36:14.010]  but there may be in the future.
[36:14.010 --> 36:16.170]  I ordered Nature Box.
[36:16.170 --> 36:17.850]  Dude, I approve of Nature Box.
[36:17.850 --> 36:21.490]  They do not sponsor the show in any way yet, but that shit's awesome.
[36:21.490 --> 36:23.770]  It tastes good. It's good serving sizes.
[36:24.250 --> 36:27.850]  I've been replacing my sugary desires with something from Nature Box,
[36:28.010 --> 36:28.930]  and I feel better, man.
[36:28.930 --> 36:30.770]  My teeth aren't going to rot away as quickly.
[36:30.770 --> 36:31.770]  My guts aren't going to die.
[36:31.770 --> 36:33.210]  I'm not going to get diabetes.
[36:33.210 --> 36:35.410]  And that shit is good. It's tasty.
[36:35.690 --> 36:37.930]  I wouldn't go to the store and buy that because at the store,
[36:38.290 --> 36:41.090]  this sounds like a paid commercial, dude, but this is the truth at the store.
[36:41.370 --> 36:45.290]  There's chocolate covered this chocolate covered that there's crispy this there's
[36:45.930 --> 36:48.530]  and oh, man, so you just I went to chocolatey one.
[36:48.530 --> 36:49.610]  I want all of them.
[36:49.610 --> 36:51.690]  But then when Nature Box sends you a box of like
[36:52.170 --> 36:54.890]  there was tomato, basil covered almonds in there.
[36:54.930 --> 36:56.090]  I'm kind of into that.
[36:56.090 --> 36:57.210]  Well, let's crack one open.
[36:57.210 --> 36:58.170]  Oh, all right.
[36:58.170 --> 37:01.770]  But you said box listeners don't go there yet because we're going to get you
[37:01.770 --> 37:03.450]  a promo code on the next episode.
[37:03.450 --> 37:08.250]  Yeah, because this is our yeah, this is our promo for the commercial for Nature.
[37:08.290 --> 37:10.690]  I really am not sponsored by these guys, but it's such a good idea.
[37:10.690 --> 37:11.890]  I'm all about taking care of myself.
[37:11.890 --> 37:12.410]  Yeah, go for it.
[37:12.410 --> 37:14.370]  I just reached in and grabbed a random delicious.
[37:14.370 --> 37:16.450]  This one is called Coconut Cashews.
[37:17.730 --> 37:20.450]  Yeah, we'll have a couple of coconut cashews.
[37:20.730 --> 37:23.250]  Let's eat on a podcast like Joey Diaz or something.
[37:23.770 --> 37:24.850]  I'm not already superior.
[37:24.850 --> 37:27.450]  I'm not going to mouth fuck the fucking microphone.
[37:27.810 --> 37:29.810]  Did you hear you got a comment from a listener that said,
[37:29.810 --> 37:33.250]  I'm not going to see you tonight because you because you chew on like
[37:35.330 --> 37:37.770]  oh, that was on Diaz's podcast.
[37:37.770 --> 37:39.490]  All right. Thank you, brother.
[37:39.490 --> 37:41.810]  Nice. Yeah, this should sound great on a podcast.
[37:42.170 --> 37:45.370]  And while I take a couple of mom in a right before I'm going to ask Clint,
[37:45.370 --> 37:49.770]  Clint came to the show because he wants to talk about not professional grade weed.
[37:49.890 --> 37:51.090]  Yeah, he had some questions.
[37:51.090 --> 37:53.130]  He's like, I'm not a pro and your weed kills me.
[37:53.330 --> 37:57.650]  Dude, I'm seriously like I'll take one hit of a ball and that's good for me.
[37:57.890 --> 37:59.090]  Like I'm done.
[37:59.090 --> 38:01.370]  Like even right now, I took one.
[38:01.370 --> 38:05.050]  You guys saw how minimal I took of that one and it's fucking me up.
[38:05.810 --> 38:07.770]  That's why I got all quiet when you were talking.
[38:07.770 --> 38:12.330]  You know, I'm just going to level with you because I'm it's just it's too strong,
[38:12.330 --> 38:14.610]  too fast. I've only been smoking for two months.
[38:15.130 --> 38:16.690]  You don't need rocket fuel yet.
[38:16.690 --> 38:22.530]  No, I need fucking give me that unleaded shit that that 309 fucking
[38:23.210 --> 38:27.090]  number 85 fucking the 85 octane and not the turbo boost.
[38:27.130 --> 38:29.570]  Yeah, please do not put nitrous in my fucking.
[38:29.610 --> 38:31.530]  So you don't want to take a half gram dab?
[38:31.530 --> 38:33.810]  No, I'm not touching dabs.
[38:33.850 --> 38:35.690]  I love you guys, but you can go
[38:37.090 --> 38:39.130]  shop it, brother.
[38:39.130 --> 38:41.170]  You can put that hot meal in your ass, boy.
[38:41.730 --> 38:43.130]  I don't want to touch it. It's scary.
[38:43.130 --> 38:48.130]  But the thing is, is I'm getting like a huge high off of one hit.
[38:48.370 --> 38:51.730]  And that's and I know we've said this since before I was smoking.
[38:52.250 --> 38:54.850]  We said start slow.
[38:54.850 --> 38:58.530]  Now, if I think here in a couple of minutes like it, it didn't hit me well enough.
[38:58.530 --> 39:00.410]  I might take another one. I'm not doing that today.
[39:00.410 --> 39:02.170]  I got to work tonight. But.
[39:03.610 --> 39:06.130]  That's the thing is, I need to know, how do I get my hands
[39:06.130 --> 39:11.010]  some on some like mediocre weed unless I'm growing or finding it in the ditch
[39:11.010 --> 39:12.250]  somewhere.
[39:13.330 --> 39:15.610]  My smart ass answer is just go to the dispensary.
[39:18.770 --> 39:21.410]  Just look at all their jars and pick the one that smells like hay.
[39:23.570 --> 39:26.250]  Or maybe you need something more high in CBD.
[39:26.570 --> 39:29.850]  That's but also but less THC would be beneficial for you.
[39:30.090 --> 39:32.130]  You're not alone here.
[39:32.130 --> 39:35.930]  There are a ton of people that have either avoided marijuana
[39:35.930 --> 39:39.010]  because of the legalities or, you know, for whatever reason,
[39:39.010 --> 39:41.810]  and are now walking into a dispensary going, hmm.
[39:42.850 --> 39:47.170]  And yeah, they've a rookie cookie is the product name that sticks in my mind.
[39:47.170 --> 39:48.010]  There was an article about it.
[39:48.010 --> 39:49.410]  The Denver Post not too long ago.
[39:49.410 --> 39:50.930]  Is that an actual Colorado product?
[39:50.930 --> 39:54.530]  I'm pretty sure that is a product that's sitting on Colorado dispensaries.
[39:54.530 --> 39:55.530]  That's all. Shout out something.
[39:55.530 --> 39:56.890]  It's just a spectacular name.
[39:56.890 --> 39:57.730]  The rookie cookie.
[39:57.730 --> 40:00.850]  If I walked in as a 55 year old dude into a dispensary
[40:00.850 --> 40:04.850]  and hadn't really consumed cannabis ever and I saw rookie cookies,
[40:04.850 --> 40:07.130]  I would like clap and laugh.
[40:07.130 --> 40:08.770]  Some of those, please.
[40:08.770 --> 40:11.370]  That's me. Do you have rookie weed, too?
[40:11.370 --> 40:14.330]  And they're starting to stock it in a number of dispensaries.
[40:14.330 --> 40:18.170]  From what I understand, the demand is huge for they want regular weed.
[40:18.170 --> 40:19.410]  Not back in the day.
[40:19.410 --> 40:21.370]  Amazing. We're going to be 21 to smoke weed.
[40:21.370 --> 40:24.370]  Yeah, we get all these kids turning 21 and they're like, well, it's legal now.
[40:24.370 --> 40:26.130]  I can do it. I can go out to the bar.
[40:26.130 --> 40:27.410]  I can join the military.
[40:27.410 --> 40:29.810]  I can go smoke some pot and that's fine.
[40:29.810 --> 40:34.370]  But it's just I don't want kids starting like with with some goddamn Bruce Banner
[40:34.370 --> 40:38.250]  that'll fucking knock me on my ass or that Bubba Kush.
[40:38.250 --> 40:40.090]  That that'll that'll kick my ass.
[40:40.090 --> 40:41.410]  Yeah, it'll set you down for a minute.
[40:41.410 --> 40:43.530]  Yeah. And it's like four hours.
[40:43.530 --> 40:46.690]  I can't do anything like I'm just like, all right, I'm like,
[40:46.690 --> 40:48.850]  I guess I'm going through the cosmos right now.
[40:48.850 --> 40:51.770]  My mom used to smoke occasionally not to bust my mom out.
[40:51.770 --> 40:53.770]  But back in the day, my mom's fucking hippie, dude.
[40:53.770 --> 40:56.650]  She's smoke weed back in the day and she slowly quit.
[40:56.650 --> 40:59.250]  And she hasn't smoked for years now that she's got a good job and shit.
[40:59.250 --> 41:02.570]  But I joke with her every occasionally, you know, like, you want to smoke joint, mom?
[41:02.570 --> 41:05.450]  And she's like, I would. But your your weed's too damn strong.
[41:05.730 --> 41:08.450]  She's like, the last time I smoked with you guys, it was just hell.
[41:09.250 --> 41:10.970]  She used to love it. She was a pothead, dude.
[41:10.970 --> 41:13.250]  She used to wake and bake like I remember when I was little,
[41:13.250 --> 41:15.690]  her and my uncles would hang out and smoke joints all day long.
[41:16.010 --> 41:18.130]  And now she's like, nope, that weed gets me too high.
[41:18.130 --> 41:19.570]  And my uncles are the same way, too.
[41:19.570 --> 41:20.210]  They used to be.
[41:20.210 --> 41:23.170]  That's where I learned my shit was from my uncles that were pious and party animals.
[41:23.690 --> 41:25.570]  And now they're like, dude, you're crazy.
[41:25.570 --> 41:27.930]  That weed's too good. Like, it's too good.
[41:28.410 --> 41:29.810]  That's kind of funny. Yeah.
[41:29.810 --> 41:32.410]  Well, and then you're going to get those guys that used to smoke eight joints
[41:32.410 --> 41:35.410]  and not get high back in the 70s because it was dirt weed.
[41:35.690 --> 41:38.290]  And then they come and they're like, well, shit, I can smoke a whole joint.
[41:38.570 --> 41:40.330]  Why would I even be worried about it?
[41:40.330 --> 41:41.690]  And it's been 20 years.
[41:41.690 --> 41:43.050]  So they have zero tolerance.
[41:43.050 --> 41:45.490]  And all of a sudden they're thinking, oh, this is going to be the same thing
[41:45.490 --> 41:47.450]  as that fucking dirt weed.
[41:47.450 --> 41:50.930]  They go home, roll a joint, take five hits and get halfway through it.
[41:50.930 --> 41:53.170]  And yeah, by then it's too far.
[41:53.210 --> 41:56.570]  The Colorado rules, the laws say that they're supposed to have
[41:56.570 --> 41:59.010]  every product tested, even the buds.
[41:59.050 --> 42:01.690]  So they should have a THC level printed on the jars.
[42:01.850 --> 42:02.930]  We're not there yet.
[42:02.930 --> 42:04.210]  A lot of the shops aren't complying.
[42:04.210 --> 42:04.930]  They just can't afford it.
[42:04.930 --> 42:06.890]  And there's not enough testing facilities. Yeah.
[42:06.890 --> 42:10.450]  Right. Once we get to that point, you need something like closer to 10.
[42:10.730 --> 42:12.690]  What you've been smoking is in the 20 range.
[42:13.290 --> 42:15.050]  20 percent. Yeah.
[42:15.050 --> 42:17.010]  I've grown herb that's tested in the 27s.
[42:17.330 --> 42:19.970]  Spence actually hit 29.
[42:19.970 --> 42:20.770]  Did he grow that?
[42:20.770 --> 42:21.610]  He grew that. Yeah.
[42:21.610 --> 42:24.050]  From those Rehan's Rhino from seed, the Spence grew.
[42:24.050 --> 42:26.290]  Shout out to the fucking Spence.
[42:26.290 --> 42:28.050]  Yeah. Also, shout out to Steep Hill Halen Labs.
[42:28.050 --> 42:29.610]  They're the ones that test our stuff.
[42:29.610 --> 42:31.530]  That was. Yeah, they did a good job.
[42:31.530 --> 42:34.730]  But but that's what I'm getting at is like there's just like, I don't know.
[42:35.210 --> 42:38.130]  You know, I guess that was more of my question was like,
[42:38.130 --> 42:40.610]  is there a strain that you would recommend to a newbie?
[42:40.610 --> 42:42.770]  Oh, no. Flow.
[42:43.010 --> 42:45.370]  Oh, flow. FLO. Yeah. Sorry.
[42:45.370 --> 42:46.970]  No, it's cool. I threw it out real quick.
[42:46.970 --> 42:49.850]  Just happens to be the one that I used to grow.
[42:50.370 --> 42:51.850]  I still got the flow around.
[42:51.850 --> 42:54.250]  This is still around. Yeah, it's a it's a perfect tie.
[42:54.250 --> 42:55.970]  It's a nice it's like a 50 50 hybrid.
[42:55.970 --> 42:58.530]  The cut that I have is I feel like it's a 50 50 hybrid.
[42:59.410 --> 43:00.570]  It's not too overpowering.
[43:00.570 --> 43:02.850]  It's got a good body high. It's got a good head high.
[43:02.850 --> 43:05.290]  But for me, it doesn't hit me hard enough.
[43:05.290 --> 43:06.330]  I almost got rid of it.
[43:06.330 --> 43:08.650]  But a lot of my friends are like, dude, you've got to grow the flow.
[43:08.650 --> 43:09.930]  So it's still here.
[43:09.930 --> 43:12.370]  Flow is what I like for days, for a long time,
[43:12.370 --> 43:15.290]  when you've got a whole bunch of stuff to do, but can't be in pain all day.
[43:15.290 --> 43:20.050]  I'd throw up a little flow for the morning and I'd be good all day.
[43:20.050 --> 43:23.850]  And it wasn't near as powerful as what I wanted for evenings, but
[43:24.490 --> 43:26.010]  maybe like some jelly bean.
[43:26.010 --> 43:27.530]  Jelly bean might be good for you.
[43:27.530 --> 43:30.090]  Yeah, just something to maintain, you know, like I'm not trying to get
[43:30.210 --> 43:32.450]  fucking blasted and go take a nap.
[43:32.450 --> 43:33.970]  Like I got to do the laundry.
[43:33.970 --> 43:38.650]  Right. You know, like speaking of laundry, these cashews.
[43:39.210 --> 43:40.730]  Was that almonds or cashews?
[43:40.730 --> 43:42.290]  They're coconut cashews.
[43:42.290 --> 43:44.090]  Those are really good. Those are delicious.
[43:44.090 --> 43:45.650]  Dude. Nature box all day.
[43:45.650 --> 43:48.650]  That's what I set them down because I wanted to have one at a time
[43:48.970 --> 43:51.290]  because I was because I loved it so much.
[43:51.290 --> 43:54.770]  And now I'm a guy who has listened to Rogan's podcast and everybody's podcast
[43:54.770 --> 43:56.770]  that says, oh, go get nature's box.
[43:56.770 --> 43:58.250]  This converted me right now.
[43:58.250 --> 44:01.890]  It did. I'm going to go home and and if I can remember and not be high,
[44:02.290 --> 44:04.050]  I'm going to fucking order me some.
[44:04.050 --> 44:06.810]  You'll get the munchies and you'll be like, oh, I should order nature box.
[44:06.850 --> 44:09.850]  Oh, what was the name of that thing that we were talking about?
[44:10.130 --> 44:12.210]  Why doesn't that episode come out already?
[44:12.250 --> 44:13.530]  That's what happened to me.
[44:13.530 --> 44:16.130]  I hear Rogan and Diaz talk about it all the time.
[44:16.530 --> 44:18.850]  And I think Nerdist even promotes nature box.
[44:18.970 --> 44:20.290]  So they did a free thing.
[44:20.290 --> 44:22.490]  They're like, if you order now, it's free. You get a free box.
[44:22.490 --> 44:24.530]  I didn't pay anything for this box of munchies that were eaten.
[44:24.890 --> 44:25.850]  They came straight to the door.
[44:25.850 --> 44:29.290]  But now every month I'm going to get a box for nineteen ninety five, I think.
[44:29.330 --> 44:30.410]  It's like proactive.
[44:30.410 --> 44:33.530]  But I think it's worth what I would go pay.
[44:33.530 --> 44:35.650]  Nature's box like they used to sling crag.
[44:35.690 --> 44:37.850]  Yeah, yeah. It's like the Columbia House of Snacks.
[44:37.850 --> 44:39.330]  First one's free.
[44:39.330 --> 44:42.530]  I just wanted everybody to know we all we were all going to stop for a second
[44:42.530 --> 44:44.730]  and eat and then it was just like, no, dude, this.
[44:44.730 --> 44:47.130]  Yeah, it's pretty delicious shit. I approve nature box.
[44:47.370 --> 44:50.010]  Hey, nature box, if you're listening, contact me for a sponsorship
[44:50.010 --> 44:52.090]  because I support your product and it would work well.
[44:52.170 --> 44:53.850]  Did you hear that awesome ad we just did?
[44:53.850 --> 44:55.890]  Yeah, we actually just pumped you up a lot.
[44:56.210 --> 44:58.810]  All right. We've been recording for a long time and Mike has some news.
[44:58.810 --> 45:00.090]  I know we're going to put Mike on again.
[45:04.450 --> 45:06.010]  Back by popular demand.
[45:06.010 --> 45:07.850]  We'll try to keep everybody awake while he talks.
[45:09.490 --> 45:12.890]  So save me a couple of minutes to read a couple of listener comments,
[45:12.890 --> 45:15.930]  but tell us about the new cannabis news that you were telling me about
[45:15.930 --> 45:19.530]  when you first showed up to the house, the local profits and such.
[45:19.530 --> 45:23.450]  Oh, the the local Pueblo City budget came out this week
[45:23.450 --> 45:26.250]  and the city seems to think they're going to get
[45:26.490 --> 45:30.530]  500000 worth of marijuana taxes just for the next year.
[45:30.570 --> 45:32.650]  Yeah. For the actual city of Pueblo.
[45:32.650 --> 45:34.010]  But wait for the punch line.
[45:34.010 --> 45:38.010]  The punch line to that is is the number that they're going to get next year
[45:38.010 --> 45:40.610]  is zero, not 500000.
[45:40.610 --> 45:44.690]  And it's zero instead of 500000 because we don't have any marijuana businesses.
[45:44.690 --> 45:48.090]  You actually have to actually have to have a marijuana business
[45:48.090 --> 45:52.570]  located in your city to enjoy taxes from those businesses.
[45:52.930 --> 45:56.810]  And the Pueblo County has already made about 500 grand this year
[45:57.250 --> 46:01.530]  between the rec shops and the medical shops, the local tax
[46:01.530 --> 46:04.970]  and the little kickback that the state sends on the statewide tax.
[46:05.170 --> 46:07.970]  Now, I've looked most of city council in the face recently.
[46:08.130 --> 46:10.170]  They seem like an intelligent group of people.
[46:10.170 --> 46:12.930]  Where are they predicting this money comes from if we're not allowed
[46:12.930 --> 46:14.010]  to have a dispensary?
[46:14.010 --> 46:17.890]  The the city manager puts that budget together and hands it to city council.
[46:17.890 --> 46:19.850]  That's part of the meeting we saw the other night.
[46:20.090 --> 46:23.690]  And so they're probably looking at it, thinking the same thing.
[46:23.690 --> 46:27.250]  Everyone in Pueblo that read the Chieftain today and the three of us are thinking is,
[46:27.770 --> 46:31.010]  well, if it's really zero because we don't have any marijuana businesses,
[46:31.010 --> 46:33.370]  where's this 500000 number?
[46:33.410 --> 46:34.490]  Well, I heard him.
[46:34.490 --> 46:38.810]  The irony in that is I honestly I rarely go to city council meetings and I will now.
[46:39.290 --> 46:41.610]  I'm an anxious person and I felt intimidated to go.
[46:41.610 --> 46:43.450]  I've broken the ice and I'm not afraid anymore.
[46:43.450 --> 46:45.970]  You'll see me there more often. Thank you.
[46:45.970 --> 46:47.050]  I don't know what I was going to say.
[46:47.050 --> 46:48.410]  Remind me where I was headed with that.
[46:48.450 --> 46:50.010]  Oh, right at the beginning.
[46:50.010 --> 46:53.050]  One of their first things was and we're proud to announce it last week
[46:53.050 --> 46:55.850]  where our budget was like four hundred and eighty four thousand dollars
[46:55.850 --> 46:57.290]  or a million dollars short.
[46:57.290 --> 46:59.570]  But we've presented to you a balanced budget this week.
[46:59.570 --> 47:01.850]  And that's one of the things we fixed in our work sessions.
[47:02.170 --> 47:04.130]  But they didn't really present a balanced budget.
[47:04.130 --> 47:05.850]  Now they just revealed their secret.
[47:05.850 --> 47:08.770]  They added in five hundred thousand dollars that they're not going to get.
[47:08.770 --> 47:09.530]  They made it up.
[47:09.530 --> 47:10.050]  Oh, no.
[47:10.050 --> 47:14.610]  What I'm a little worried about is if that 500 grand pot number was in there
[47:14.610 --> 47:18.050]  before they carved out the three and a half million or whatever
[47:18.050 --> 47:22.090]  that they carved out over the last week, they might have been four million short.
[47:22.090 --> 47:24.530]  And they only filled the whole three and a half million worth
[47:24.530 --> 47:26.730]  because they're pretending there's another half million
[47:26.730 --> 47:29.330]  that's going to come out on a weed man's ass. I don't know.
[47:30.330 --> 47:31.970]  But you have to have a pot store to get.
[47:31.970 --> 47:34.970]  They would let a couple of dispensaries build within city limits.
[47:34.970 --> 47:38.810]  The licensing alone is three hundred or I think it's like three thousand dollars
[47:38.810 --> 47:39.850]  for one.
[47:40.330 --> 47:43.850]  Each license, you have to have several, depending on what you're doing,
[47:43.850 --> 47:46.090]  is five grand to the city and the state.
[47:46.370 --> 47:51.130]  So it's essentially ten grand to do just to grow ten grand to do the store,
[47:51.130 --> 47:53.330]  ten grand to do the hash making.
[47:53.330 --> 47:56.250]  So if they open five shops, they make twenty five G's right away.
[47:56.290 --> 48:00.210]  Minimum. The city's already just opening in about five shops.
[48:00.210 --> 48:01.250]  It'd be 50 G's.
[48:01.250 --> 48:02.610]  Oh, you mean I see what you're saying.
[48:02.610 --> 48:03.570]  Different public split it.
[48:03.570 --> 48:06.810]  But but the problem with that, though, is is what they're worried about
[48:06.810 --> 48:09.690]  is that you can't just allow one because that's a monopoly
[48:10.130 --> 48:12.850]  and you can't just allow five because that's still a monopoly.
[48:12.850 --> 48:15.850]  In my opinion, you can't say, oh, you got here too late.
[48:15.850 --> 48:16.890]  You're not allowed to start.
[48:16.890 --> 48:18.370]  That's not the American way.
[48:18.370 --> 48:21.850]  This town doesn't really need more than and this sounds ridiculous coming from me.
[48:21.850 --> 48:25.250]  But if a shop did it right, three or four shops would be more than enough for this.
[48:25.330 --> 48:28.330]  I agree. But that's that's on the businesses to decide later.
[48:28.330 --> 48:31.730]  Like, oh, you know, I don't think we can make money by starting one.
[48:32.170 --> 48:34.690]  So, yeah, we're going to get an influx of five.
[48:34.890 --> 48:37.410]  And then all of a sudden it's going to be like, wow, we're we're
[48:37.490 --> 48:41.010]  we're all not doing great, but this guy's not doing well at all.
[48:41.170 --> 48:44.810]  And then he closes down and we're going to see that one of these days.
[48:45.170 --> 48:46.930]  We're going to see the first pot shop close down.
[48:46.930 --> 48:48.450]  We're going to be like, that's weird.
[48:48.450 --> 48:50.650]  Like if a liquor store goes out, we're like, oh, we get it
[48:50.650 --> 48:53.450]  because there's a liquor store on every every corner.
[48:55.130 --> 48:56.650]  Thank you. Excuse me. You can do it, bro.
[48:56.650 --> 48:57.290]  I know I can't.
[48:57.290 --> 48:59.490]  Single handedly cleaning up the airwaves. There we go.
[48:59.810 --> 49:03.210]  There we go. No, but what I'm saying is like we see a liquor store on every
[49:03.210 --> 49:05.690]  and there's a bar on every other one.
[49:05.690 --> 49:09.010]  So we see all these liquor stores and a liquor store goes out.
[49:09.010 --> 49:10.410]  We're like, oh, yeah, of course it did.
[49:10.410 --> 49:12.170]  There's super competition.
[49:12.170 --> 49:13.970]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen with weed.
[49:13.970 --> 49:16.970]  And so prices are going to have to start dropping and that's better for everybody.
[49:17.970 --> 49:19.650]  That's in Washington right now.
[49:19.650 --> 49:23.490]  You're looking at sixty dollars and change for a gram of legal marijuana.
[49:23.610 --> 49:27.730]  What's the look you two just gave me is the look that you should have given me
[49:27.730 --> 49:28.450]  because it's nuts.
[49:28.450 --> 49:31.330]  But if you're paying sixty dollars for a gram of marijuana,
[49:31.330 --> 49:34.250]  you need to slap yourself in the face with your own penis.
[49:34.770 --> 49:37.850]  You need to listen to a good podcast that teaches you how to grow
[49:37.850 --> 49:39.130]  and provide your own cannabis.
[49:39.130 --> 49:41.490]  And then you need to go to nature's green remedies dot com
[49:41.690 --> 49:46.090]  and use coupon code helping hands and order yourself some freaking high grade seeds.
[49:46.090 --> 49:49.970]  I recommend I read genetics, gauge green genetics or maybe some alpha chronic.
[49:50.770 --> 49:53.130]  We actually watch what you're talking about
[49:53.890 --> 49:57.490]  with pod stores closing and the price dropping with medical over the last decade.
[49:57.610 --> 50:00.850]  And then when January 1st, the whole clock reset,
[50:00.850 --> 50:05.090]  they just wound it back to 2004 pods back to 450.
[50:05.130 --> 50:07.210]  So it's this place that's got 60 dollar grams.
[50:07.210 --> 50:08.970]  Is that because of a supply and demand thing?
[50:08.970 --> 50:11.130]  Yeah, that's the all of the shops, right?
[50:11.210 --> 50:12.690]  All of the shops in Washington.
[50:12.690 --> 50:15.330]  There's a very few shops that are open.
[50:15.330 --> 50:17.370]  Their supply is extremely limited.
[50:17.370 --> 50:21.130]  They didn't have the time to bring in the crops before this all went live.
[50:21.130 --> 50:23.370]  Like with the licensing, you weren't allowed to grow
[50:23.810 --> 50:26.810]  for very long before shops were allowed to open.
[50:27.130 --> 50:30.450]  So they just haven't had any time in a year or two when,
[50:30.770 --> 50:33.370]  you know, shop numbers have risen significantly.
[50:33.370 --> 50:35.890]  Production numbers, you know, had a time to come in.
[50:36.450 --> 50:37.610]  All of that will change a bit.
[50:37.610 --> 50:41.770]  But it's going to be a year or two before you can buy a reasonable gram
[50:41.770 --> 50:42.890]  legally in Washington.
[50:42.890 --> 50:45.090]  Seattle has no idea what's coming to them.
[50:45.090 --> 50:46.370]  I know a little secret right now.
[50:46.370 --> 50:46.970]  Seattle.
[50:48.970 --> 50:50.730]  You got some shit coming.
[50:50.730 --> 50:51.450]  Oh, they deserve it.
[50:51.450 --> 50:54.090]  I'm excited and I'm proud for Seattle and for what's happening.
[50:54.130 --> 50:55.290]  That's going to be a great thing.
[50:55.290 --> 50:57.530]  Good luck. Super excited for who we're talking about.
[50:57.530 --> 50:59.010]  I'm really disappointed that it's happening.
[50:59.010 --> 51:00.930]  We'll make the announcement closer to the start of the year.
[51:00.930 --> 51:02.010]  Guys, we've got some cool news for you.
[51:02.010 --> 51:03.530]  There's a lot of cool stuff coming up.
[51:03.530 --> 51:05.290]  That's not really our announcement to make.
[51:05.290 --> 51:07.450]  Yeah, we'll have we'll have those people on the show.
[51:07.450 --> 51:09.130]  It'll be dope.
[51:09.130 --> 51:11.130]  Dope. So, Mike, you got your news out.
[51:11.130 --> 51:12.370]  Clint, you got to ask about.
[51:12.370 --> 51:13.050]  Well, we didn't.
[51:13.050 --> 51:14.610]  You just got to find some shitty weed, I guess.
[51:14.610 --> 51:15.970]  Dude, you got to go to.
[51:15.970 --> 51:17.050]  Man, we figured it out.
[51:17.050 --> 51:19.290]  Go to a dispenser to bring you some.
[51:19.290 --> 51:20.450]  You brought me some good weed.
[51:20.450 --> 51:21.170]  I'm afraid.
[51:21.170 --> 51:24.490]  See, that's the thing is I'm always constantly afraid of like whatever I get to.
[51:25.050 --> 51:26.850]  So so is this going to kill me?
[51:26.850 --> 51:30.490]  Like, is this the one that sends me into like a panic or something like that?
[51:30.970 --> 51:34.490]  Like, unfortunately, so far, you know, I've gotten really fucking high
[51:34.490 --> 51:39.010]  and it hasn't like I haven't had like this huge bad trip or anything like that.
[51:39.050 --> 51:40.330]  And you're probably not going to.
[51:40.330 --> 51:42.490]  No, that's the thing is I can talk myself out of it
[51:42.490 --> 51:44.570]  because I know I'm on drugs right now.
[51:44.570 --> 51:45.770]  I understand it's not.
[51:45.770 --> 51:48.890]  Well, yeah, no, but I mean, as high as you're getting, it probably feels that way.
[51:49.450 --> 51:49.890]  That's good.
[51:49.890 --> 51:53.290]  You need to be able to remind yourself that cannabis can't kill humans.
[51:53.610 --> 51:54.370]  No, that's fine.
[51:54.370 --> 51:54.770]  It's not.
[51:54.770 --> 51:56.810]  It's been my mantra when you're too high.
[51:56.850 --> 51:58.330]  Now you're just killing cancer.
[51:58.330 --> 52:00.010]  Yeah. Fuck yeah.
[52:00.010 --> 52:01.410]  I got cancer for sure.
[52:01.410 --> 52:01.930]  You're too high.
[52:01.930 --> 52:02.850]  Your cancer is too high.
[52:02.850 --> 52:05.530]  Also, it's just going backwards, going, I don't know what to do.
[52:05.530 --> 52:06.570]  I'm not cancer anymore.
[52:06.570 --> 52:07.530]  And it just starts dying.
[52:07.530 --> 52:08.730]  I'm making all of that up.
[52:10.570 --> 52:12.650]  Because Jeff is not a doctor.
[52:12.650 --> 52:13.770]  Surprisingly, you guys.
[52:13.770 --> 52:17.250]  Surprisingly, you wouldn't you would never get is a medical opinion.
[52:17.770 --> 52:21.610]  So Clinton is talking about getting too wrecked off of like a bowl of too good a weed.
[52:21.610 --> 52:23.770]  And last night I did a gram dab
[52:24.250 --> 52:28.290]  and I honestly have not been that high since I did a half gram dab recently.
[52:30.530 --> 52:31.090]  But it took me.
[52:31.090 --> 52:34.290]  No, you remember on the show when I ate that three hundred and fifty milligram edible.
[52:34.330 --> 52:37.890]  Yeah, I was nearly I was equally high, but in a different way.
[52:38.610 --> 52:41.810]  I was like red eyed and stoned.
[52:41.810 --> 52:44.850]  I was Chinese last night after that gram dab when I ate that edible.
[52:44.850 --> 52:47.130]  I was I felt like I was on energy drugs.
[52:47.330 --> 52:48.970]  I was jumping around and giddy.
[52:48.970 --> 52:50.010]  I couldn't jump around.
[52:50.010 --> 52:51.850]  There was no giddy last night.
[52:51.850 --> 52:55.010]  Shout out to giddy up since I keep saying giddy when I'm giddy up 710.
[52:55.010 --> 52:57.330]  I bumped into him on chat roulette and it was really funny.
[52:59.130 --> 53:00.370]  He had his pants on. It was cool.
[53:00.370 --> 53:04.970]  The stoners and people jerking off is two dudes staring at each other, smoking weed.
[53:06.690 --> 53:07.810]  What do you what are you doing?
[53:07.810 --> 53:08.450]  What are you doing?
[53:08.450 --> 53:11.770]  While I was about to hit this funny, like we both came on and we go, hey,
[53:12.210 --> 53:13.450]  because we recognized each other.
[53:13.450 --> 53:16.850]  And then I held up my rig and he held up his rig and we started laughing like,
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.890]  yeah, taking dabs on chat roulette.
[53:19.330 --> 53:21.850]  Like everyone else has their wiener out on that channel.
[53:21.850 --> 53:22.650]  And it's kind of weird.
[53:23.530 --> 53:27.170]  All right. If you're into online chatting with other stoners,
[53:27.170 --> 53:30.970]  there's a thing called Puff Puff Chat that I've heard about in a number of places,
[53:30.970 --> 53:34.450]  but I haven't actually attempted to enjoy trying to keep up with somebody.
[53:35.050 --> 53:38.250]  The last set of TV to fast forward just to fuck with you.
[53:39.130 --> 53:41.890]  Like they're just dogging on these fucking things.
[53:41.890 --> 53:44.210]  And you're like, oh, I can't keep up.
[53:44.210 --> 53:48.050]  Oh, this this little tiny chick is kicking my ass.
[53:49.090 --> 53:51.210]  This is bullshit.
[53:51.210 --> 53:52.330]  I have no tolerance.
[53:52.330 --> 53:53.650]  So it'd be I'd be done.
[53:53.650 --> 53:55.290]  I love puff puff. What was it?
[53:55.290 --> 53:56.890]  I think it was called Puff Puff Chat.
[53:56.890 --> 54:00.410]  The last time I got online for something that was designed for stoners
[54:00.410 --> 54:03.010]  to come together and get stoned on webcams together,
[54:03.090 --> 54:05.450]  it got shut down like an hour after it started.
[54:05.450 --> 54:07.970]  And like the D.A. showed up and were like, what are y'all doing?
[54:08.610 --> 54:10.370]  Videoing yourself committing crimes.
[54:10.370 --> 54:11.410]  Oh, this sounds fun.
[54:11.410 --> 54:13.450]  You can't prove it. And oregano.
[54:13.450 --> 54:15.250]  Oregano. Yeah.
[54:15.250 --> 54:17.610]  My Facebook page used to say this is all an illusion.
[54:17.610 --> 54:19.210]  Nothing you see here is real.
[54:19.210 --> 54:20.650]  Like just to.
[54:20.650 --> 54:22.010]  And then we live in Colorado.
[54:22.010 --> 54:23.930]  I do live in Colorado and I take dabs
[54:23.930 --> 54:27.810]  and I've got the legal allowed amount of cannabis, so I don't give a shit right now.
[54:28.810 --> 54:29.610]  That's right. All right.
[54:29.610 --> 54:30.490]  We got to start wrapping it up.
[54:30.490 --> 54:31.530]  We're close to an hour.
[54:31.530 --> 54:33.970]  Mike, you got any plugs or any shit to wrap the show up with?
[54:35.450 --> 54:37.130]  That's a blank stare.
[54:37.130 --> 54:40.170]  Clint, you start thinking I should have some notes
[54:40.170 --> 54:43.690]  about when the next commissioner meeting or when the next city council meeting is.
[54:43.690 --> 54:45.810]  But I don't.
[54:45.930 --> 54:49.490]  Guys, if you are a cannabis supporter in the city of Pueblo, Colorado,
[54:49.490 --> 54:53.050]  the county of Pueblo, Colorado, please follow Mike Nikon.
[54:53.330 --> 54:56.330]  Not like a Nemo Punk, Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[54:56.330 --> 54:59.010]  He's Nikon is what it comes up under the name there.
[54:59.250 --> 55:01.810]  It's confusing and obnoxious and a little soft mark.
[55:01.810 --> 55:04.290]  But at this point, I'm proud of a handful of my followers,
[55:04.290 --> 55:07.290]  like a couple of major news outlets follow my retarded ass.
[55:07.290 --> 55:10.530]  And I don't want to start over.
[55:10.530 --> 55:12.850]  So I'm just going to kind of bear that Nemo Punk 15.
[55:12.850 --> 55:14.010]  Crossed. Find it.
[55:14.010 --> 55:17.370]  And plodes. Find him on there because he will tweet when all of the meetings are.
[55:17.370 --> 55:19.050]  He's going to take that responsibility.
[55:19.050 --> 55:21.850]  The city council meetings that we need to go to, the commissioner's meetings,
[55:21.850 --> 55:23.050]  the planning and zoning meetings.
[55:23.050 --> 55:25.250]  If it feels like there's a cannabis presence needed,
[55:25.250 --> 55:27.450]  Michael, start tweeting that stuff out for us.
[55:27.730 --> 55:29.930]  I grow culture. We'll start retweeting that.
[55:30.250 --> 55:32.250]  We'll have a little community action.
[55:32.250 --> 55:33.450]  Talk, let's help.
[55:33.450 --> 55:34.730]  Talk, let it's your turn, buddy.
[55:34.730 --> 55:35.850]  It's your place.
[55:35.850 --> 55:38.490]  Find me on Facebook and Instagram.
[55:38.490 --> 55:40.570]  Tall Clint, Twitter, Tall Clint.
[55:40.570 --> 55:44.490]  It's all I just stuck with the same thing because I want to brand it, I guess.
[55:44.530 --> 55:45.850]  I don't know. It works well.
[55:45.850 --> 55:47.570]  Talk, words. Yeah. Yeah.
[55:47.570 --> 55:49.730]  And I'm Tom and I'm Clint.
[55:49.730 --> 55:51.130]  I hope you don't think it's Cliff.
[55:51.130 --> 55:52.650]  Of course, the Adams was taken.
[55:52.650 --> 55:54.890]  It looked like another word the first time I saw it on there.
[55:55.010 --> 55:57.330]  It did not look like it said Clint.
[55:57.330 --> 56:00.730]  There's no end in the words you're thinking of or there is an end in the world.
[56:01.290 --> 56:03.410]  You're thinking of when the L and the I become a U.
[56:03.410 --> 56:04.490]  Yes. Yeah. That one.
[56:04.490 --> 56:06.690]  It looks like the L and the I have united to a U.
[56:07.810 --> 56:10.690]  If it's going to be in my name, it makes complete sense.
[56:10.690 --> 56:13.610]  That's why I thought I think I said that word on the show earlier, actually.
[56:13.810 --> 56:14.850]  Yeah, you did. That's funny.
[56:14.850 --> 56:15.810]  I may edit that word out.
[56:15.810 --> 56:18.170]  I've never said that on a podcast.
[56:18.170 --> 56:20.250]  I can't say the F one, but that one, that's weird.
[56:20.690 --> 56:23.770]  Yeah, well, we're not trying to offend people and people get offended by that.
[56:23.770 --> 56:29.210]  All right. So if you have a charity, hit Rasta Jeff up to to take another cuss word out of this vocabulary.
[56:31.010 --> 56:32.450]  Oh, man.
[56:32.450 --> 56:34.170]  Guys, since everyone's doing plugs, check me out.
[56:34.170 --> 56:37.130]  I no longer have the I read genetics Facebook page that sucks.
[56:37.130 --> 56:40.290]  So follow at I grow culture on Instagram and Twitter.
[56:40.290 --> 56:42.130]  I grow culture has a Facebook page.
[56:42.130 --> 56:43.130]  Of course, you can follow me.
[56:43.130 --> 56:47.050]  I've started posting dad videos and weed pictures on at Rasta Jeff for 20.
[56:47.050 --> 56:49.610]  That was hard to say for some reason.
[56:49.610 --> 56:51.450]  I want to give a couple of shout outs.
[56:51.450 --> 56:54.290]  People left me some really cool comments on iTunes.
[56:54.330 --> 56:56.890]  Thank you guys for leaving the iTunes comments.
[56:56.890 --> 56:59.130]  This first comment is from Hippie Nurse 710.
[56:59.130 --> 57:00.250]  What up, Hippie Nurse?
[57:00.250 --> 57:00.970]  Hope you're doing well.
[57:00.970 --> 57:01.810]  You're having a rough day.
[57:01.810 --> 57:04.530]  I hope listening to the podcast and hearing a shout out makes you smile.
[57:05.050 --> 57:07.730]  You've got a rough job and I appreciate what you do.
[57:07.730 --> 57:09.170]  She's a nurse at night, dude.
[57:09.170 --> 57:10.610]  God, I have so much respect for that.
[57:10.610 --> 57:13.410]  She doesn't know how much respect I have for it, but maybe she will now.
[57:14.570 --> 57:16.730]  Her comment says and she gave us five stars.
[57:16.730 --> 57:17.290]  Thanks for that.
[57:17.290 --> 57:19.850]  Her comment says, I've been a listener since episode one.
[57:19.850 --> 57:23.570]  I can hear a difference in the tone, quality and flow of each episode as you progress.
[57:23.850 --> 57:26.250]  You guys are getting better and better with each episode.
[57:26.490 --> 57:28.330]  I love that you keep it light and informative.
[57:28.650 --> 57:31.330]  It makes it easier for newbies like myself to understand.
[57:31.370 --> 57:32.690]  Keep up the good work.
[57:32.930 --> 57:33.530]  I love it.
[57:33.810 --> 57:35.010]  Yeah, that's what we're aiming for.
[57:35.010 --> 57:35.890]  So thanks a lot, Hippie Nurse.
[57:35.890 --> 57:37.730]  Thank you for listening since episode one.
[57:39.330 --> 57:43.330]  She used to always she would tweet me and message me like, when is the new episode coming?
[57:43.370 --> 57:44.410]  When is the new episode coming?
[57:44.410 --> 57:46.850]  And I was like, it comes out at 710 in the morning on Mondays.
[57:47.010 --> 57:48.250]  And she said, I work nights.
[57:48.250 --> 57:49.930]  Can it come out at 420 a.m.?
[57:50.290 --> 57:51.650]  And so now it comes out.
[57:51.650 --> 57:56.090]  That's why it pops up kind of randomly late at night on Sundays so that she can listen to it.
[57:56.210 --> 57:56.730]  That's awesome.
[57:56.730 --> 57:57.650]  Sunday shift at work.
[57:57.810 --> 57:58.210]  Nice.
[57:58.210 --> 57:59.170]  What we do for the listeners.
[57:59.170 --> 58:00.370]  And she sent us a nice comment.
[58:00.370 --> 58:00.810]  So thanks.
[58:00.810 --> 58:01.410]  It works out well.
[58:01.450 --> 58:02.570]  I hope you're doing well, Hippie Nurse.
[58:02.610 --> 58:04.210]  Yeah, we need some more five stars, guys.
[58:04.210 --> 58:04.610]  Please.
[58:04.690 --> 58:04.970]  Yeah.
[58:05.010 --> 58:05.930]  Well, we got another one.
[58:06.410 --> 58:08.610]  This guy, Billy Bob Ray.
[58:08.650 --> 58:10.010]  No, it's Billy Bobo Ray.
[58:10.330 --> 58:11.970]  Billy Bobo Ray.
[58:12.010 --> 58:12.370]  Yeah.
[58:12.770 --> 58:13.770]  Billy Bobo Ray.
[58:13.770 --> 58:14.810]  Boba Fett Ray.
[58:15.050 --> 58:15.810]  That could be the guy.
[58:15.810 --> 58:16.490]  Charles.
[58:17.650 --> 58:20.170]  He's not just from Oregon or South Carolina.
[58:21.130 --> 58:22.770]  Or a Bobo Shanti Rastafarian.
[58:23.410 --> 58:24.210]  All possibilities.
[58:24.210 --> 58:24.730]  All of them.
[58:24.770 --> 58:25.330]  I like this guy.
[58:25.930 --> 58:27.610]  Or his middle name could be Bobo also.
[58:27.690 --> 58:30.210]  You might have the same problem I have with a bad handle though, bro.
[58:31.730 --> 58:36.330]  So he says, Rasta Jeff is fun to listen to, but be prepared for some stoner moments.
[58:36.330 --> 58:39.730]  Like where was this conversation going and what were we talking about?
[58:39.890 --> 58:41.330]  Hey dude, that happens.
[58:41.330 --> 58:46.330]  We are smoking award-winning hash, award-winning flowers.
[58:46.650 --> 58:48.810]  Um, I don't think he was being disparaging on that.
[58:48.810 --> 58:51.050]  No, I think it was kind of just a, here you go guys.
[58:51.050 --> 58:51.610]  It's fun.
[58:51.650 --> 58:52.250]  Great show.
[58:52.250 --> 58:52.930]  That's going to happen.
[58:52.970 --> 58:54.330]  So you're aware sometimes.
[58:54.330 --> 58:55.250]  I don't take offense to that.
[58:55.250 --> 58:56.170]  That's accurate shit.
[58:56.210 --> 58:56.810]  I'm high.
[58:57.370 --> 58:58.210]  It's going to happen.
[58:58.330 --> 58:58.970]  Fuck yeah.
[58:59.010 --> 59:00.530]  That's part of the fun of the whole thing though.
[59:00.610 --> 59:03.730]  Uh, I sometimes random shit is where the good shit comes out.
[59:03.930 --> 59:05.650]  I used to script almost everything.
[59:05.690 --> 59:08.290]  I used to type out like a lot of what I was going to say.
[59:08.490 --> 59:10.290]  And then I listened to the episodes and it felt like this.
[59:10.450 --> 59:10.970]  Good evening.
[59:10.970 --> 59:12.930]  Thank you for listening to Hi Girl Culture podcast.
[59:12.930 --> 59:13.610]  My name is Jeff.
[59:14.010 --> 59:17.290]  And now I write like bullet points and try to rant on those bullet
[59:17.290 --> 59:20.610]  points and keep it moving because it feels a lot better, but that does
[59:20.610 --> 59:22.490]  create those donor moments that's for sure.
[59:23.770 --> 59:26.290]  It's because he doing Billy Bobo Ray.
[59:26.330 --> 59:26.610]  Yeah.
[59:26.610 --> 59:28.570]  He was saying, you were saying you were going to keep reading this thing.
[59:28.610 --> 59:29.450]  Oh, that's, that's what he wrote.
[59:29.450 --> 59:29.850]  That's what he wrote.
[59:29.850 --> 59:30.890]  And he gave us four stars.
[59:30.930 --> 59:33.650]  So that's cool enough for works for works.
[59:33.650 --> 59:33.890]  Yeah.
[59:34.090 --> 59:36.210]  Maybe I passed middle school with a 60.
[59:36.210 --> 59:38.890]  So this is way better.
[59:40.410 --> 59:40.850]  I like it.
[59:41.450 --> 59:41.890]  I like it.
[59:41.890 --> 59:42.010]  Dude.
[59:42.010 --> 59:43.090]  Thanks for leaving a comment.
[59:43.090 --> 59:46.450]  Billy Bobo Ray, Billy Bob, Bob Ray.
[59:46.490 --> 59:49.010]  We apologize for butchering your name repeatedly.
[59:49.330 --> 59:50.450]  I'm high and making it fun.
[59:50.450 --> 59:50.810]  It's cool.
[59:50.810 --> 59:51.570]  I'm not butchering it.
[59:51.610 --> 59:53.050]  It's got me entertained as she is.
[59:53.050 --> 59:56.210]  I don't think we had any, where's this going moments this episode.
[59:56.250 --> 59:58.650]  I think this whole episode was aware of the hell is this going?
[59:59.530 --> 01:00:03.170]  I felt like Jeff was trying to drag me back to the point like for an hour.
[01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.090]  Well, just not an hour, but you know, there's a couple of good minutes in there.
[01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:06.770]  Guys.
[01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.650]  I hope you heard me trying to put him back on track.
[01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.770]  We cut on nature box for at least 10 minutes.
[01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.610]  Those fucking almonds were great.
[01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:17.450]  Those, you know, don't go back.
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.850]  Don't go back.
[01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:18.450]  We got to go back.
[01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:20.290]  We already sold that product.
[01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.010]  There you go, Bobo.
[01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.570]  I fixed it.
[01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:23.330]  I saved it.
[01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:26.530]  I wish that I could get my nature box at high grow indoor growing supply.
[01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:29.410]  All right.
[01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.090]  We're going to wrap this up guys.
[01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:34.210]  Um, I have Jesse coming back in a couple of episodes.
[01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:37.290]  I'm not sure if he'll be back this week or in about 10 days.
[01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:38.050]  He's hard to get here.
[01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:38.850]  He's a busy man.
[01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:39.570]  He's married.
[01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:40.530]  He works several jobs.
[01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:41.370]  He's an awesome dude.
[01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:45.130]  He's worth waiting for, but we're going to discuss building your grow room.
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:50.570]  People have asked also a listener said that they have a $500 budget and they
[01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.690]  would like to learn how to grow a small grow room to supply themselves.
[01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.210]  I have a couple of good ideas on how that might work.
[01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.450]  So I'm going to work on that for you.
[01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:58.450]  We'll put an episode together.
[01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:01.250]  I have a couple of news articles that I did not read on this show.
[01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.850]  So there'll be coming up in the next episode.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.570]  Dude, thank you guys for listening.
[01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:06.490]  I'm going to read that part that I read at the end of the show.
[01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.370]  It goes like this.
[01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:10.410]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:15.130]  search for I grow culture, find the review section, give me a five or a four star rating.

[01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.530]  They're nothing fancy as I get caught up.
[01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:52.290]  The videos are getting better and better and better.

[01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:06.490]  some time out of your night.
[01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:07.530]  Thanks brother.
[01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:08.610]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:08.970]  Yeah.

[01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:12.730]  Ask the thing.
[01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:13.250]  Ask.
[01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:14.690]  I'd love to answer the questions.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:15.410]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:18.010]  You know, I don't feel, I'm not here to entertain myself.
[01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:21.050]  It does feel really great to put this out, but I'm here to help everybody out.
[01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.410]  I've got a good grasp on this.
[01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:23.890]  I love podcasting.
[01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:26.770]  So I'm here to help you guys out until next time, guys, take a fat
[01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:28.490]  dab, give your mom a hug for me.
[01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.650]  So much.
[01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:39.490]  Yeah, I know it's right.
[01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:45.210]  This internal struggle, this emotional fight.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.060]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode number 37
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.460]  of the I grow culture podcast.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.620]  It's me again, Ross to Jeff.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.780]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.820]  Joining me on the microphone today is Jesse from high grow.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.420]  How you doing, bro?
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.580]  How's it going guys?
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.780]  Doing pretty good, dude.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.380]  Thanks for coming.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:53.660]  Right on.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.980]  In this episode, Jesse and I are going to talk a little bit about
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.060]  building your grow space.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.740]  Honestly, this may end up being a multi-episode discussion because I
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.940]  know we're going to leave stuff out.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.980]  We're going to forget things.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.860]  Uh, we took quite a few notes.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.300]  We wrote quite a bit of stuff down and the more I wrote, the
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.940]  more I feel like we were missing.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.940]  So we're going to try to keep notes on what we're missing while we go.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.780]  And we'll keep this conversation going.
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.420]  But before we get to that part, we got to pay some bills.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.580]  This podcast is brought to you by cannabis grand crew.

[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.580]  We didn't really advertise.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.620]  Jesse didn't advertise much.
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.060]  It was kind of a test run.
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.820]  We just wanted to kind of see what would happen.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.100]  Uh, he wanted to see what would happen.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.580]  We had about 12 people there for most of the evening evening.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.180]  I'd say about 20 people showed up for the peak of the night when, uh, Spence and
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.060]  Maddie and big Mike and Michael showed up, that made about 20 people in the room.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.180]  A big shout out to everybody that came, the people that I met, the people that I
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.300]  already knew, thanks for coming and supporting something like that.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.540]  Big, huge thanks to Bert and Jesse and Hygro for letting us gather in the store.

[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.180]  All right.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:17.340]  So, um, we were talking about building your grow rooms and last night there were
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.300]  actually some new growers at the party and we got to help them build a pretty
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:20.740]  sweet room.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.180]  It was kind of nice to, they're like, we don't know what to do.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.420]  And Jesse and I looked at each other and it was neat.
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.100]  Cause we had the exact same idea in our heads.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.220]  We're like, do this.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.740]  And they pretty much are going to do that.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.260]  I think.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:30.740]  Yeah.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.300]  Uh, so in this show, we're going to talk about a few different ways to set up a
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:37.180]  grow space, uh, that is suitable for your production needs.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.820]  I also found a comment on the Facebook page that asks for guidance in building
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.340]  a space for $500.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.820]  Uh, that's a really tight budget for a grow room, but I'll see what I can come
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:48.100]  up with.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.700]  I Googled a few items to try to save some pennies, but that's a challenge.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.740]  You had 500 bucks.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.660]  Um, how big is the space?
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.020]  Well, she just said, help me out.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.740]  Teach me how to build a space for 500 bucks.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:01.420]  She said she's, uh, on a very low budget.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.660]  Uh, I have her Facebook comment.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.940]  I'd have to read to remember exactly what she said, but I think she's also
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.500]  disabled.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.500]  So we're going to have to build her something that's not heavy.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.500]  That's not a lot of work.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.420]  I have an idea that's accessible and I want to build like a PVC frame and then
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.340]  wrap it in some sort of Mylar type thing.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:19.740]  And then, uh, maybe hang a small T five light in there and that'll get her going.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.860]  You know, we'll talk more about that.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.500]  We'll get that going.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.060]  Once we get into the, uh, the building, the gross stuff a little more.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.780]  Uh, let's talk about building grows.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.180]  Uh, there's a few things to consider when you're going to plan your grow before
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.940]  you even go to the hardware store, before you ever go to the hydro shop, there's
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.980]  stuff you got to think about.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.580]  The first thing to think about, in my opinion, is, is it legal where you are?
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.900]  Uh, I'm not going to help you break the law.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:47.020]  The first part of this is, uh, move to a location where cannabis is legal.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.900]  If you want to follow my rules.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.940]  So don't do this in an illegal state, move to Colorado, go to California or even
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.300]  better.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:59.060]  Do what you can to get cannabis legalized or decriminalized where you are so that
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:11:59.860]  you can grow legally.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.980]  I don't want to be responsible for you breaking the law.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:05.220]  So if you plan on breaking the law, just change to another podcast.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:06.860]  All right.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:08.740]  Uh, sorry.
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.140]  I don't want, I don't want to go to, I don't want you to go to jail for what I'm
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:13.100]  telling you, but you're going to do what you're going to do.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.780]  So, uh, the next thing to think about, uh, understand the risk you're taking, because
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.780]  if you're growing in a state that's not legal, the consequences can be quite
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.180]  severe.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.700]  It's not just you you're putting at risk.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.340]  Uh, if you're growing in a house, everybody in that house is in trouble.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.140]  If you have a family and you go to jail, that's going to just cause a tidal wave
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.580]  of bullshit in your life.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.100]  So keep that in mind.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.660]  Uh, the next thing that I would say to think about is what are your realistic
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:37.940]  needs?
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.380]  If you're committed, you're going to grow some cannabis for yourself.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.740]  What are your realistic needs?
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:45.580]  Do you need to grow for yourself, your family, uh, maybe a few patients, or are
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.940]  you trying to become the next big production facility in your area?
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.180]  So my next idea would be set a goal and kind of stick with that for a few cycles
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.860]  to see what you're doing.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.780]  You can't, you're not going to know how good of a grower or what kind of crop you
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.500]  get on the first grow.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.220]  Stick with that, set something up, stick with it for a couple of cycles, and then
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.660]  adjust to your needs after you've gone a couple of rounds.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.580]  Like don't run your first lap and then think my shoes are too tight.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.380]  My shoes are too loose.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.180]  Run a couple of laps, see what you're good at, then adjust.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:17.180]  So my next thing to consider, I would say is does your location have viable
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.020]  electricity?
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.020]  Um, this is something Jesse really stressed on when he got here to talk about
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:26.620]  this, uh, running more than one or 2000 watt lights in a room may require some
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.420]  electrical upgrades.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.220]  If you want to be safe, if your breakers are flipping and you're scrambling to keep
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.340]  everything running, that's when you're creating a fire hazard and you don't want
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.460]  to be on the news for burning down your house, growing weed.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:37.900]  No.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.940]  In your experience, can you usually just run like a thousand watt light, the blower
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.580]  that it requires and a couple of fans.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.580]  And if you have like a hydro bubbler or whatever, is that pretty much what one
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.140]  room can do?
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:49.620]  Yeah.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.740]  Most, most residential rooms have about 30, 30 amps breaker.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.020]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.140]  And so that you're, and if you're putting an air conditioner in there, you're taking
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.660]  up half a breaker just with that.
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.340]  The light takes up about half a breaker.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:05.100]  Uh, if you're flipping the breaker, when you turn on the dishwasher or whatever, uh,
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.060]  have an electrician come and help you out.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.220]  There are a lot of electricians.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.700]  Actually, if you're in the Pueblo area, I have an electrician that I will refer
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.620]  because he's looking for some work he's off and he could use your, uh, your job.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:18.260]  So, uh, don't burn down the house, please.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.340]  Please don't burn down the house.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.140]  Don't create that fire hazard with electricity.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.380]  Also, if you're in a legal, in an illegal state, this is something I just thought
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.860]  of, you're going to have to have an excuse for all that electricity.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.860]  If you're 1000 watt light is going to kick your light bill up about a hundred
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.580]  dollars per month, an additional hundred, like the light and the fan and the blower
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.260]  it takes to run it.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.380]  You're looking about another a hundred dollars every month.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.220]  Uh, if you're just a dude in an apartment or something like that, that may spark
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.620]  some concerns, you might want to get a hot tub.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.460]  Uh, we've heard of people using welding equipment, just get something to kind of
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.980]  make it look like you're doing something.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.900]  Put a bunch of table saws in the garage.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.300]  If you've got that option, you know, look like you have some more for
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.980]  that power consumption to go empty, empty saltwater fish tanks.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:05.620]  But you know, all of that stuff, I bet you, they can tell that my timers
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.700]  are on 1212 over at the crow, you know, and they're like, oh yeah, every day at
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.340]  eight o'clock, this guy kicks on thousands of Watts and then every day at
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.380]  eight o'clock they kick off.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.140]  They're not retarded.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.420]  Sorry if retarded is an offensive word to you.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.060]  Uh, so will you be able to ventilate your space is the next thing I would think
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:21.460]  about.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.220]  A fresh air is super important.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.140]  Stale, stagnant, humid air is the number one cause for powdery mildew.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.660]  It'll also slow your growth and make your plants look ugly.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.780]  Makes the room stink.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.860]  You want to be able to walk into your grow room and close
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.460]  your eyes and not smell pot.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.260]  You want it to smell like a nice clean room.
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.100]  So keep that in mind.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.100]  You have to be able to ventilate that space.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.260]  Number five on my list of things that you should consider.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.380]  Is your grow space safe and secure?
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.980]  You may need to hide your grow from the landlord or your nosy
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:49.340]  in-laws that come over for dinner.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.860]  Are you ready to live the grow life in your house?
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.580]  That doesn't sound like a huge question, but dude, when you've got pot plants in
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.780]  your house, your whole house will stink.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.260]  If you don't have it under control, you might need some carbon filters.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.260]  You might need an extra carbon filter or two.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:08.660]  Um, I always have a carbon filter on the air that is going out the exhaust, but
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:11.540]  then also I'll hang a carbon filter with the blower on it, just right in the
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.100]  middle of the room on the ceiling to act as a scrubber, just to clean even
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.860]  more air and that eliminates more odor.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:19.420]  Uh, we were talking about Ona gel last night.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.020]  They sell Ona jar, Ona gels in like a plastic jar.
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.700]  They say to take the lid off and just leave it sitting.
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:30.100]  But I actually poke little pencil size holes with the drill right in the
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.980]  lid and then just let it sit.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.860]  And then once it gets down to about a third of the jar, I just add like a half
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.100]  a cup of water in there and shake it.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.700]  And it rehydrates all the crystals and it lasts a little longer.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.900]  Uh, put those by your door, like your entryway to your home or entryway to
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.820]  wherever you're growing and people's nose will hit that first and now their nose
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.020]  has already kind of, they've been punched.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.900]  So they're confused.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.300]  And when they smell the herb, they won't know that it's herb, hopefully.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:53.740]  Yeah.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.340]  So you can put them in inside your ducting too.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.100]  Oh yeah.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.700]  That's a good idea.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.380]  There you go.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.060]  It'll blow that, move that odor around instead of the cannabis odor.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.420]  I'm going to add a random side note.
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.220]  This is just a really random sidebar.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.020]  Cause I just thought about it.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.020]  I keep hearing a lot of people say the word marijuana.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.740]  Marijuana is a racist word and it sounds bad.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.060]  People are afraid of marijuana.
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.500]  Cannabis is the new word.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.940]  Uh, cannabis sounds better.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.620]  It doesn't sound as racist.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.340]  And I know that's a weird way to put it, but we were taught
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.020]  that marijuana is the devil.
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.780]  And if you smoke marijuana, you're going to get crazy and rape white bitches.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.100]  Cannabis will heal you.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.780]  Cannabis stops cancer.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.660]  So I think we should just try to abandon the word marijuana
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.940]  and say cannabis a lot more.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.140]  That's just my random, uh, sidebar for the day.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.940]  Marijuana actually literally is a racist word.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:39.660]  That's it was.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:39.900]  Yeah.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.420]  I mean, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.100]  Don't doubt that people was invented by the government.
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:48.500]  That's a huge history lesson to discriminate against Mexicans.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:48.660]  Yeah.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:51.300]  They didn't like the Mexicans that were coming to America and smoking
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:55.660]  marijuanas and then bringing it to the jazz musicians, that's all reefer madness.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.140]  You guys, hopefully, you know about that already and hopefully, no, hopefully
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.660]  you're not that brainwashed and you never paid attention to that.
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.220]  Hopefully you just call it cannabis.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:03.020]  All right.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.660]  Uh, safe and secure grow space, living the grow life.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:09.500]  Another big thing to consider is the location of your grow inside of your
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.900]  house or wherever you're doing it.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.860]  Uh, the basement is generally the coolest spot.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.700]  You're insulated by dirt and concrete walls and you're underground.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.740]  You don't get a lot of climate changes there in the basement.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.300]  Also, hopefully you don't get a lot of traffic down there in the basement.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.660]  You got like one room in the corner in the back or something you can just dedicate.
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.180]  Uh, the attic is going to get hot.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.900]  The attic is the top of the house.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.260]  It's getting hit by the sun.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.380]  Um, you don't have all this insulation from the dirt and the concrete walls.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.860]  The attic is going to be a little more challenging, so you're going
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.300]  to need more cooling power.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.700]  You're going to have to adjust.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.780]  Your snow melts off the, or the snow melts off your roof in the middle of the
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.740]  weather and it's the only house in the neighborhood.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:50.860]  You're the only house that your roof is clean because you just melt.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:51.180]  Yeah.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.180]  Uh, I've had to make an adjustment because I noticed that I was
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.540]  melting snow somewhere one year.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.060]  I was like, oh, that's obvious as shit.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.460]  Uh, also guys, this is something we'll cover, cover a little later,
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.420]  but I want to jump to it.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:02.980]  You're going to have to get water there.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.540]  So putting your plants in the attic, uh, once you get all the grow equipment
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.220]  hung up up there and everything's up there, now you have to get water up there.
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:10.820]  Often.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.060]  So keep that in mind.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.340]  Um, and then another, go ahead.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:14.940]  You got some dad
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:15.740]  addicts.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.620]  Just if you can avoid it, it's just really not a good place to grow.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.060]  It's actually a pretty, pretty good, uh, fire hazard.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:22.900]  Oh yeah.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.820]  I mean, uh, it's, uh, I mean a significant fire hazard.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.820]  Um, so
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:29.100]  okay.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:29.740]  Avoid the
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.220]  if you're in like Wisconsin or something though, and you can't really do it.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:37.540]  Like we can here in Colorado, nobody goes to anybody else's addict.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.220]  So that may be someone's only option.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:39.740]  For sure.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:43.220]  Guys like we're, we're talking about earlier, be safe.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.180]  And I know this sounds cheesy as hell, but safety first, bro.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.420]  You don't want to be on the news for burning down your house, growing pot,
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:53.420]  because when the news comes, you might've been growing illegal medical cannabis.
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.980]  But as soon as that fire starts and the news truck pulls out,
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:56.980]  you've got a drug lab.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:58.220]  Yeah.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.420]  They're not going to be polite.
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:03.660]  This, this medical marijuana provider accidentally sparked fire to his home.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:06.020]  Now the report's going to say, we're here in front of this house where there's a
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.180]  major drug lab on fire right now.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.220]  That's what the reports.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.020]  And you're going to be the asshole that just went to jail for doing that.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.580]  That was a nice news voice.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.180]  Do you like that?
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:14.380]  Yeah.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:14.820]  Yeah.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.220]  It sounded really weird in the headphones.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.500]  I had to bail on it kind of quickly.
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.020]  Um, so yeah, try to go lower in the house is better.
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:27.540]  Um, in Pueblo, they're trying to actually push and push an ordinance
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.300]  where we have to grow in an outbuilding.
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:32.980]  And I was reading a book doing research on this and in Jorge Cervantes book,
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.900]  he says, outbuildings are actually the worst place you could think about growing
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.780]  because that's where thieves are.
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.060]  And the cops don't consider that trespassing so they can go into your
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:42.700]  outbuilding.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.820]  It's not part of your home.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:44.700]  Yeah.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.020]  So the cops can walk right in.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.380]  That's not, it's a different rule.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:48.660]  You know, it's not part of your domicile.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.180]  It's a shed.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.420]  So they can walk right into that.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.260]  They don't need a warrant.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:55.900]  That's something we got to remind all the people that are opposed to this of Mike.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:56.940]  Did you just hear that, bro?
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.740]  You're outbuilding that they're trying to propose that we build will not be part
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.220]  of your home.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:04.940]  So it will not require a warrant is what this book that Jorge Cervantes wrote
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:05.340]  says.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.220]  Let me know how that really works.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:08.660]  Shout out to Mike.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.620]  He's my legal counsel.
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:10.820]  Um,
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.980]  growing in a shed.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.380]  It has a lot of challenges too.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:21.060]  Um, so it's going to be a lot like growing in an attic as far as, uh, trying
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.380]  to insulate it and cool it.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:22.820]  Okay.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.180]  All that.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.740]  It's going to be very difficult.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.820]  And I guess I should, uh, one more thing.
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.940]  The next step here is how are you going to cool the room?
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:32.620]  Keep in mind that you have to use more electricity for that air conditioner and
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.580]  the air conditioner has to vent itself somewhere.
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.620]  So you keep in mind how you're going to cool the room.
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.540]  Uh, I had a good point that I wanted to make, and it just left my head.
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:40.460]  What were you just telling me?
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:42.580]  What was that?
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:44.900]  With the sheds?
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:45.260]  Yeah.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:45.660]  The sheds.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:45.980]  Okay.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:46.100]  Yeah.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:46.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.460]  What our goal is, I guess I should have covered this more in the beginning, but
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.460]  your goal when you're building a grow room, you want as much control of the
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:57.180]  lights, the air, the water, the humidity, the temperature.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.140]  That's what we're trying to do.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:01.820]  We're trying to build a room that we can control to set the
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:03.780]  ideal climate for these plants.
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:06.740]  Uh, I guess we should, instead of just starting building a room, we should
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:07.780]  know what we're trying to build.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:07.980]  Right.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:08.740]  And that's what you want.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:15.260]  You want a room that you can almost automate and let that happen and just
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.740]  turn everything on properly, get everything set up properly and let it run.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:21.820]  And then when the nighttime comes, you have a nighttime temperature selected.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:22.580]  It'll get to that.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.140]  When the daytime comes again, you have a daytime temp selected.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.340]  The air conditioner kicks on at the right time.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.620]  Your fans move at the right time.
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.300]  Your blowers are all at the right schedule.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:37.340]  Then you can hit that perfect, like 50% humidity or 40% humidity mark.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.220]  You can get your 77 degree mark in there.
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.060]  Uh, you can get it all perfect.
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.620]  You can have just a little bit of wind.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.580]  That's what you're trying to do.
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:48.660]  You're trying to build that super happy, trying to build an aquarium for your
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:52.340]  plants or like a cage for plants, like the perfect habitat for these plants.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.940]  That's the climate inside your house, inside your house.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.060]  Yeah.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:55.860]  That's, that's your goal.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.580]  I guess I should have talked more about that at the beginning.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.940]  Um, once you achieve that, you know, pretty dialed in perfect climate, uh,
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.460]  growing becomes a lot easier, a lot, lot easier.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:12.540]  The room is the room, the genetics, uh, this, what you're feeding and then the
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:16.460]  grow, like how you grow, that's pretty much what your components are.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:22.220]  Uh, lights, air, water, soil, and love, you know, cleanliness is next
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:25.860]  to godliness when it comes to growing every little piece of trash or scrap.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.340]  And not just in your grow room.
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:33.980]  If your grow room is in like your mom's basement or your grandma's attic or your
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.980]  bedroom closet, all of those clothes, all those books, all those scraps of paper,
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:42.820]  all those cigarette butts, all the dust, that's all a place for a spider mite to
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:43.300]  hide.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.620]  That's all a place for a thrift to lay a bug.
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.260]  Also all that dust and cigarette smoke will end up in your
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.980]  concentrate and in your flowers.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:56.380]  If you're, I've kind of stopped sweeping my grow room now after about week six,
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.060]  because I don't want to stir up the dust and put it in my flowers.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.580]  I will let my grow room look a little shitty on the floor for a week to not
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.660]  sweep it up as often.
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.700]  Cause I don't, and I'll turn off all the fans and blowers and air conditioners now
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:11.660]  to sweep up because I don't want that sticking to my buds because that ends up
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.140]  in the hash and we're trying to make the best hash we can now.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.940]  That's, that's what seems to be the point that everybody's headed to.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.140]  I still try to grow the best flowers, but of course we want the best hash to go with
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:20.340]  that.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:20.700]  Yeah.
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:22.300]  All right.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.660]  That was a long rant.
[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:29.180]  Uh, other than things to consider, there are responsibilities that I think you
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.460]  should, uh, practice being a good grower.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.540]  Um, when you're setting up to grow, you don't want to piss off the neighbors.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.100]  You don't want to attract unwanted attention by thieves or thugs.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.500]  You don't want to get cop attention.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.900]  You definitely, this is something people don't think about.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.140]  There are kids out there that love to steal pot plants.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.300]  Now, uh, kids are getting braver.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.460]  The younger kids are getting dumber and braver.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.980]  They know what pot is.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:56.300]  They know how to find a grow and they want to steal your shit.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.500]  So keep the pot.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.260]  And there's also innocent kids that will just see your pot and want to steal it
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.140]  just because they're curious.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.140]  So be careful.
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.660]  Keep your pot away from the kids.
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:06.700]  I know I stress that, but I'm a father, so I don't want my kid finding your pot.
[01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:11.490]  Sorry, I needed a drink.
[01:25:11.610 --> 01:25:12.370]  That was a long rant.
[01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:16.970]  So some of the responsibilities that I think, and I want to thank my friends on
[01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:18.010]  Facebook for helping me out.
[01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:22.090]  I asked for a couple of pieces of advice on this topic and a few people chimed in.
[01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:23.650]  I owe a huge shout out to Mr.
[01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:24.530]  Chris Barkowitz.
[01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:27.290]  Uh, you guys know Chris Barkowitz.
[01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:28.170]  You'll know why this is funny.
[01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.410]  You can Google his name if you want.
[01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:33.530]  Uh, I asked Chris Barkowitz or asked on Facebook, what would be a few things you
[01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:36.050]  could do to be a responsible grower and not get yourself in trouble?
[01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:38.450]  Chris's reply was don't do interviews.
[01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:40.130]  Great answer.
[01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:40.770]  I love it.
[01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:42.570]  That's, that's the golden answer right there.
[01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:45.810]  Uh, Chris is finally free after that interview and welcome home, bro.
[01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:48.330]  You look good in that IRI genetics t-shirt.
[01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:52.770]  So a few responsibilities being a grower, uh, make sure your lights
[01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:54.450]  are not visible from the outside.
[01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:57.930]  Uh, when you set up your grow room, when the sun goes down, turn on all your
[01:25:57.930 --> 01:26:01.290]  grow lights, walk outside, whatever.
[01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:06.130]  If you're in the basement, attic, bedroom, walk outside and see if you can see your
[01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:08.890]  grow lights, if you can see your grow lights, fix it, you're failing.
[01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:09.810]  That's the problem.
[01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:11.370]  That also means you have a light leak.
[01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:11.930]  Yeah.
[01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:14.730]  That means the lights are getting in during your flowering cycle, which you're
[01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:16.290]  just going to cause a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:21.370]  Also your next responsibility, make sure the blowers and fans are not heard by
[01:26:21.370 --> 01:26:23.450]  neighbors or people walking past your grow.
[01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:28.650]  Uh, if there's a spot where you don't think people will ever walk the day you
[01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.570]  build a damn grow, someone's going to walk there.
[01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:32.850]  The meter made the gas guy.
[01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:36.690]  Uh, some kid chasing his dog, some cop looking for someone else.
[01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:39.530]  They're going to walk right past that blower and they're going to go, Oh, what
[01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:40.130]  is this?
[01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:42.410]  And you're going to think no one's ever going to walk there.
[01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:44.570]  But as soon as you put a blower there, dude, they will.
[01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:45.970]  That's the way life works.
[01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:47.970]  So just be careful, plan ahead.
[01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:49.610]  Make sure no one can hear your blowers.
[01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:51.050]  Make sure no one can see your lights.
[01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:56.610]  There's ways to muffle, you know, even to insulating the duct, insulating the
[01:26:56.610 --> 01:27:00.650]  blower, uh, you can disguise outlets as a dryer outlet.
[01:27:00.810 --> 01:27:01.170]  Yeah.
[01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.490]  You can try to put it through the roof.
[01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:06.530]  You know, just move the blower to the other end of the chain.
[01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:07.450]  So it's not so noisy.
[01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.810]  Yeah.
[01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:08.850]  Not right at the window.
[01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.290]  Yeah.
[01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.730]  Uh, those mufflers are a great idea.
[01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:14.330]  They're actually available at a high grow and or growing supplies.
[01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:20.010]  And actually, um, a cheaper alternative to the mufflers and a better for
[01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:22.210]  your grow is a, uh, HEPA filter.
[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:23.250]  Yes.
[01:27:23.290 --> 01:27:27.090]  Those will, you know, if it's sucking in, those will help, uh, you know,
[01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:31.130]  over, uh, all of my ends where I have, I've drilled like six inch holes or
[01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:32.770]  eight inch holes to have my ends coming in.
[01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:35.450]  I get those little square HEPA filters that are just a sheet.
[01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:38.130]  I guess they're a rectangle and I just staple those right over it with a
[01:27:38.130 --> 01:27:42.450]  staple gun onto the wall and wherever I do a grow, you want, yeah, that keeps
[01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:45.010]  your bugs out, keeps you all this stuff that you don't want in your hash.
[01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:45.930]  It keeps all that out of there.
[01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:47.730]  Filter everything twice.
[01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:48.210]  Twice.
[01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:48.730]  If you can.
[01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.050]  People are going, Oh my God, how much is this going to cost?
[01:27:53.010 --> 01:27:55.170]  You building a good grow room does cost a little bit of money.
[01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:58.410]  People were asking last night, they're like, we've got this much budget.
[01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:00.850]  Should we buy better this or better this?
[01:28:01.170 --> 01:28:03.610]  And that's kind of where I think you should get the best
[01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:04.890]  bulbs and ballast you can.
[01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:07.490]  That's your first start and then move your air.
[01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:11.170]  And then like, if you have to buy in chunks, I think you buy the lights
[01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:13.850]  and then your air moving stuff, like your ducting, your blowers, and
[01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:17.770]  then your air conditioner, and then you buy your pots and soil and nutrients.
[01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:22.690]  Uh, start with the room and just buy slowly instead of, but yeah, it's
[01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:26.170]  all about choosing where the weakest link is always going to be the weakest link.
[01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:28.610]  It's hard to decide where to pinch your budget there.
[01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:30.250]  Get the good bulbs and good ballasts.
[01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:31.810]  That's definitely my opinion.
[01:28:32.650 --> 01:28:36.410]  So, uh, here's a big issue that we've been dealing with here in Pueblo.
[01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:40.010]  This caused a lot of, most of our new laws here that are being proposed
[01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.570]  in Pueblo or because of this issue.
[01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:44.130]  Make sure nobody can smell your grow.
[01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:47.250]  The smell is the most offensive and revealing part of your grow.
[01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:47.490]  Yes.
[01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:48.290]  I said offensive.
[01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:51.370]  There are some people that do not love the smell of sweet, sweet,
[01:28:51.370 --> 01:28:52.770]  sticky ganja in the morning.
[01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:55.970]  There's a guy here in our city that keeps complaining to city council
[01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.410]  that he can smell pot every day when he wakes up because his
[01:28:58.410 --> 01:28:59.810]  neighbors are growing the dank.
[01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:03.130]  So, yeah, keep that smell down.
[01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:06.690]  Uh, if you build your grow discreetly and you don't bring attention to
[01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.490]  yourself, your neighbors will never know.
[01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:09.970]  You've got to grow in your home.
[01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:11.850]  So security issue too.
[01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:13.730]  Being able to, I mean, yeah.
[01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:13.970]  Oh yeah.
[01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:18.930]  You know, don't, you know, that's just inviting people in men or people,
[01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:21.050]  not only thieves, but mooches.
[01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:21.370]  Yeah.
[01:29:21.370 --> 01:29:23.450]  Like you made more friends than you've ever wanted.
[01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:24.970]  When people find out you grow weed.
[01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:27.130]  Can I, can I get one of those buds?
[01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:28.050]  No, dude.
[01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:29.410]  What are you talking about, man?
[01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.930]  What buds?
[01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:31.330]  There's a dead skunk in my backyard.
[01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:32.610]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:34.050]  Fucking dog got sprayed again.
[01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:39.650]  You know, uh, several years ago I lived in another house and I had a
[01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:44.170]  grow in the basement there and the power went out and I was mid flower.
[01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:45.770]  So it stinks dude.
[01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:49.730]  And the, um, the power guys had to come through everybody's backyard
[01:29:49.730 --> 01:29:50.730]  looking for the problem.
[01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:53.730]  And I wasn't at the place, but my girlfriend was there.
[01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:57.770]  And the power guy told my girlfriend, ma'am, I'd go in the house.
[01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:59.690]  It smells like you got a skunk in the backyard.
[01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:03.210]  Like he could smell my grow completely.
[01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:06.010]  And she just made a cringing face and went in the house
[01:30:06.010 --> 01:30:07.050]  and told me about it later.
[01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:10.570]  But yeah, so people can smell your, even if you can't smell it,
[01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:11.690]  people can smell your grow.
[01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:12.570]  You're around it.
[01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:13.410]  You sleep by it.
[01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:14.170]  You're in there.
[01:30:14.170 --> 01:30:15.490]  You wake up, you're smoking it.
[01:30:16.090 --> 01:30:19.330]  Uh, you're the, you're the last person that's going to smell it.
[01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.650]  Yeah.
[01:30:19.690 --> 01:30:22.610]  The church lady down the block can smell it down the street.
[01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:24.770]  So don't let anybody smell your grow.
[01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:26.210]  Here's step number four.
[01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:28.130]  To be a good, responsible grower.
[01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:30.410]  And when you're building a grow room, do whatever it takes to make sure no
[01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:32.090]  kids get ever get into your grow space.
[01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:34.530]  I stuttered when I said that, cause I mean it make sure no kids
[01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:35.730]  ever get into your grow space.
[01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:36.330]  That's important.
[01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:39.970]  Um, that's like the biggest black eye you can put on the cannabis
[01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:42.490]  community right now is letting kids get caught with your weed.
[01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.290]  Yeah.
[01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:44.810]  Here's something you might not think about.
[01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:48.210]  Most of the stuff was kind of, uh, kind of obvious, but here's a good one.
[01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:50.850]  You're going to create a lot of waste growing plants in your house.
[01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.330]  You're going to have soil and you're going to have plant stems and stocks.
[01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:54.370]  You're going to have root balls.
[01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:57.210]  Find a responsible way to dispose of everything.
[01:30:57.730 --> 01:31:01.690]  Um, some of you guys live out in the rural areas, burn that shit.
[01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:05.730]  If you can, uh, compost it, if you can.
[01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:06.290]  That's yeah.
[01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:09.370]  But see, I live in the city and my girl is in a city facility.
[01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:13.450]  And so it's all gotta be chopped up into little tiny pieces and put
[01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:16.290]  into secured trash bags and it's gotta be destroyed on site.
[01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:19.930]  Like, so the other guys, you're gonna have to find what if the trash guy
[01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:22.650]  has dumped in your trash and finds all your pot leaves in Connecticut.
[01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:23.370]  And your girl and pop.
[01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:24.810]  Uh, what if he's not cool?
[01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:25.690]  What if he is cool?
[01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:26.650]  Then he's going to want your weed.
[01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:27.450]  He's going to rob you.
[01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:29.450]  If he's not cool, he's calling the cops.
[01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:30.490]  So be careful.
[01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:32.610]  Uh, they might find your trash.
[01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.970]  That's they cannot from Jorge's book that I read.
[01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:40.810]  They cannot start a case based on your trash that does not justify a search
[01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:45.290]  warrant, but the trash can be used in court as part of the case.
[01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:49.010]  So keep an eye on the trash.
[01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:50.570]  Actually know people.
[01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:53.530]  I lived in Lawrence, Kansas, and now that I think about it, I know people that got
[01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:56.410]  busted and had their trash used as evidence in court.
[01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:59.370]  Now that I think about it, I can't remember their names, but a couple of
[01:31:59.370 --> 01:32:01.010]  kids I worked at a place with what's up guys.
[01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:05.850]  I've heard that, uh, for, you know, drug drug dealing cases back in the day and
[01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:07.690]  stuff, find that tape.
[01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:09.250]  They wrap around the packaging.
[01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.610]  Yeah.
[01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:10.970]  I had that happen to a friend too.
[01:32:11.530 --> 01:32:15.210]  I worked at a bowling alley and I found a bunch of that tape, that dark colored
[01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:18.250]  tape, and you could tell it was wrapped around like, I've seen plenty of pounds
[01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:19.730]  of weed, like brick pounds of weed.
[01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:22.490]  I don't know if it was wrapped around weed or some cocaine or something, but it
[01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:23.330]  was that kind of tape.
[01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:24.250]  And I know exactly.
[01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:27.290]  Somebody had a nice bulk of something in my bowling alley one night.
[01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:28.290]  Wow.
[01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:30.170]  You found that in the trash at the bowling alley?
[01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:32.330]  In the trash, in the bathroom, just sitting on the top.
[01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:36.610]  So you're telling me that someone at evidence lockup may have been crooked.
[01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:39.210]  No, not the evidence tape.
[01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:41.290]  Oh, that would be a lot cooler.
[01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:43.690]  You know, that like brown tape they wrapped the kilos with.
[01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:44.090]  Oh yeah.
[01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:45.130]  It was a bunch of that.
[01:32:45.330 --> 01:32:50.170]  So somebody had a kilo of coke or a pound of weed in the bowling alley, which isn't
[01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:51.930]  really surprising now that I'm thinking about it.
[01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:52.770]  Yeah.
[01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.930]  Bowling alleys are kind of sketchy places that people don't think about.
[01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:58.210]  So think about what you guys are going to do with your trash.
[01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:00.570]  You guys, you got a bunch of shit that you're going to have to throw away and
[01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:02.090]  not look obvious with it.
[01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:05.690]  If you've got more than two lights, when you harvest four lights worth of stuff,
[01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:08.330]  three lights worth of stuff, that's a lot of trash to take care of.
[01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:11.090]  And if you don't know what to do, if you don't know how to recycle and compost
[01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:13.170]  your soil, you've got soil to deal with too.
[01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:15.250]  It's got perlite in it.
[01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:16.610]  It's got old nutrients in it.
[01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:17.410]  You got to be careful.
[01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.690]  Here's another one.
[01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:21.890]  Keep your yard and house clean and presentable.
[01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:25.250]  Don't give your neighbors or anyone in the neighborhood a reason to dislike you.
[01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:26.450]  Don't stand out.
[01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:31.130]  If the house is on your block, get the lawn mowed once a week, go mow the lawn
[01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:31.850]  once a week.
[01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:35.570]  If they got flowers growing outside and it's a bunch of yuppies, look like a bunch
[01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:37.570]  of yuppies and grow flowers outside, dude.
[01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:39.210]  Try to fit in the best you can.
[01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:41.730]  Don't be, just don't be the neighborhood asshole.
[01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:46.450]  If you're going to grow cannabis, uh, help out, you know, when it snows, shovel
[01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.770]  the extra house in front or house next door on each side of you, just do what you
[01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:51.610]  can to kind of be friendly.
[01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:55.210]  A friend of mine, Amanda on Facebook said she actually just moved into a new house
[01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:57.370]  and she's building her grow in there in a legal state.
[01:33:57.370 --> 01:33:58.210]  So I can talk about her.
[01:33:58.490 --> 01:34:02.370]  She said she walked to her neighbors on either side and introduced herself and said,
[01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:03.290]  Hey, my name's Amanda.
[01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:04.010]  I'm the new neighbor.
[01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:04.970]  Here's my phone number.
[01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:07.130]  If you ever have any problems, feel free to call me.
[01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:09.290]  If you guys ever want to hang out, just let me know.
[01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:12.490]  So by making friends and giving them her number, she's done two things.
[01:34:12.810 --> 01:34:15.250]  Uh, if they get pissed off at her, they won't call the cops.
[01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:18.410]  They'll call her or they'll come over and be like, Hey dude, you're grateful.
[01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:19.530]  Dead music's too damn loud.
[01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:21.410]  Can you hippies chill out with the drum circle in here?
[01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:22.810]  Sorry, Amanda.
[01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:23.690]  I hope you're listening to that.
[01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:25.570]  And then, uh, she'll stop, you know?
[01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:29.370]  And then also if something's wrong, they don't have to call nine one one.
[01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:32.130]  They can call her and be like, your house is glowing.
[01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:34.290]  Like there's a bunch of light coming from the basement window.
[01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:35.130]  Your curtain fell.
[01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:35.890]  What's happening.
[01:34:36.330 --> 01:34:37.690]  They don't have to get to the cops right away.
[01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:39.090]  So just be a good neighbor.
[01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:40.890]  Introduce yourself, make friends, be social.
[01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:41.530]  That's my point.
[01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:45.090]  Uh, number seven, we've talked about this.
[01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:48.410]  Don't burn the place down and make us all look like assholes.
[01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:51.210]  Uh, this cannabis revolution is new.
[01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:53.410]  Uh, there are tons of people who hate the movement.
[01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:54.810]  Fox news hates us.
[01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:58.130]  Uh, anytime some dipshit burns down a house by blasting indoors
[01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:01.450]  or overpowering his breaker box, it makes the entire movement look stupid.
[01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:04.490]  So please guys, don't be the asshole we see on Fox news.
[01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:06.970]  Like I said earlier, they're not going to say this medical
[01:35:06.970 --> 01:35:08.690]  marijuana provider had a snafu.
[01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:11.290]  They're going to say this drug lab erupted in flames.
[01:35:11.850 --> 01:35:14.530]  Uh, and you're going to be on the news and handcuffs in the back of a cop
[01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:15.810]  car, looking like a dipshit.
[01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:17.130]  Please don't be that guy.
[01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.850]  Please.
[01:35:18.850 --> 01:35:23.410]  And there's, there's no reason to grow equipment is pretty cheap nowadays.
[01:35:23.490 --> 01:35:23.810]  Yeah.
[01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:25.890]  Don't use some sketchy asshole.
[01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:29.730]  If you're running a bunch of lights, get yourself a power box, plug it into the
[01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:31.530]  two 40 and plug all the lights into that.
[01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:32.450]  And you're pretty much legit.
[01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:34.050]  You can run like eight lights on that thing.
[01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.930]  Oh, nine or 12.
[01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:36.210]  Yeah.
[01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:39.690]  Um, I've seen like 16 light ones.
[01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:44.410]  Um, but, uh, yeah, if you know, and electrical upgrades
[01:35:44.410 --> 01:35:45.690]  aren't really that expensive.
[01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:49.090]  So if you're going nuts, you know, do it the right way.
[01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:51.410]  Don't run extension cords all over the day.
[01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:53.810]  Each extension cord is a fire hazard.
[01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:54.410]  Each one.
[01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:58.890]  Uh, if you need electrical upgrades, guys, just call Craig's list is filled
[01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:04.010]  with electricians that advertise that they're MMJ friendly or four 20 friendly.
[01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:08.450]  Get one of those, get one of those guys to come wire up your shit, because
[01:36:08.530 --> 01:36:10.090]  when they do it, you'll be so impressed.
[01:36:10.090 --> 01:36:11.530]  It looks so cool to have your stuff.
[01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:14.570]  The first time you get a professionally wired up grow room, you got the wire
[01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:17.530]  going, like the little conduit going all the way across the room with the box,
[01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:19.890]  every like eight feet or six feet for a plugin.
[01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:23.650]  And then like a big, one big breaker box on the outside of the room that you
[01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:26.930]  could shut everything off so that, you know, you can work on shit, not get any
[01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:28.610]  electricity, man.
[01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:29.770]  That is so sweet.
[01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:31.170]  Look in the first time you get that.
[01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:32.770]  So have a pro come do that.
[01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:34.050]  Find them on Craig's list.
[01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:38.130]  If you need to, if you're in the Southern Colorado area, I've got a guy, I got two
[01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:38.770]  guys for you.
[01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:42.410]  So if this first guy is busy, we can send his, his old boss to come help you out.
[01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:46.570]  Um, yeah, don't bring the shit down.
[01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:47.730]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:49.850]  There's no, yeah, no reason for it.
[01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:53.570]  That should be, you know, one of the number one things when you're setting up a
[01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:58.490]  grow room is guys, I always add a fire extinguisher and a smoke alarm.
[01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.810]  Uh, put a smoke detector in the grow rooms.
[01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:03.010]  Uh, put it near the, the exhaust fan.
[01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:06.530]  Like if you've got a carbon filter sucking air out, put it near there because
[01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:08.330]  the smoke is going to get sucked toward that.
[01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:10.810]  Uh, that way put the smoke alarm there.
[01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:14.970]  I put a fire extinguisher outside of the damn grow room because you don't want to
[01:37:15.490 --> 01:37:16.810]  run in there and get the extinguisher.
[01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:19.010]  If that room is on fire, you want to be able to kick in the door and
[01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:20.370]  just start spraying that shit.
[01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:23.890]  Uh, at high grow indoor growing supplies, you can pick up an
[01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:25.250]  item called the flame defender.
[01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:26.210]  I haven't used it.
[01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:27.730]  I've done a lot of research about it.
[01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:29.210]  Uh, did that.
[01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:30.170]  I need those.
[01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:31.450]  Those look like the way to go.
[01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:33.810]  I think we're going to get ourselves set up with those.
[01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:34.450]  Yeah.
[01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:35.810]  Some we'll test them.
[01:37:35.890 --> 01:37:37.330]  Hopefully we never have to test them out.
[01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.730]  Yeah.
[01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:39.810]  Hopefully we never find out how good those work.
[01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:40.170]  Yeah.
[01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:40.810]  All right.
[01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:44.650]  Um, so guys, once you figured out how much herb you need to produce, that's
[01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:46.450]  when you can start designing your grow space.
[01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:50.770]  Uh, actually sometimes your space dictates how you build your grow.
[01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:52.890]  That's where, that's where the fun kicks in.
[01:37:52.890 --> 01:37:57.170]  In my opinion, uh, building a grow is all about adapting to the space you're provided.
[01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:59.130]  Some of you guys are going to use a small closet.
[01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:00.770]  Some of you might use a spare bedroom.
[01:38:01.090 --> 01:38:03.090]  Some of you guys are going to buy a grow hut and set that up.
[01:38:03.130 --> 01:38:05.250]  I will do a lot of talking about a grow hut.
[01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:06.330]  Maybe not on this episode.
[01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:07.730]  We're already 35 minutes in.
[01:38:08.210 --> 01:38:10.490]  Uh, but I will definitely I'm writing that down.
[01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.970]  Crow hut.
[01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:12.970]  They're very versatile.
[01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.330]  Yeah.
[01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:18.450]  Um, a lot of people made fun of them at first, but I have done some breeding.
[01:38:18.490 --> 01:38:19.970]  I've done some Fino selection.
[01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:22.170]  I've done some great growing and just a grow hut.
[01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:22.650]  They're great.
[01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:26.530]  If you have limited space, you can put it in the corner of your bedroom and it's awesome.
[01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:30.210]  I've seen a whole bedroom full of them.
[01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:33.010]  That was a quite the little production area.
[01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:34.850]  So it's pretty neat.
[01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:40.010]  So, uh, since I'm only allowed a small plant count here in Pueblo in my house.
[01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:46.210]  In a spare bedroom, I run two five by five hydro huts on a flip box, uh, with
[01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:51.330]  a 600 watt light in each hut, but what happens, I run one ballast, the ballast
[01:38:51.490 --> 01:38:53.210]  plugs into the wall on a timer.
[01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:54.610]  So it goes ballast.
[01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:57.890]  And then there's a cord that goes to the flip box.
[01:38:57.890 --> 01:39:01.250]  And then the flip box has two cords that come out and a bulb comes from each one.
[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:06.570]  And every 12 hours side a lights up and then for 12 hours, it stays on and then
[01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:08.650]  it shuts off and the other side comes on for 12 hours.
[01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:12.930]  So instead of adding electrical upgrades to that bedroom that I'm just using in the
[01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:16.570]  winter as a grow space for the, it keeps the house warm up here actually.
[01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:20.010]  So I just run that, uh, using the flip box.
[01:39:20.010 --> 01:39:23.730]  I can use that room all the time and have it flowering constantly and not
[01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:25.130]  have any downtime in that room.
[01:39:25.450 --> 01:39:25.810]  Nice.
[01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:26.090]  Yeah.
[01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:29.770]  So, uh, it's like a, an 11, it's like a 14 by nine room.
[01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:32.610]  So those two five by five huts fit perfectly in there.
[01:39:32.610 --> 01:39:35.250]  And it gives me a little bit of room to work because I really like the girl huts.
[01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:36.850]  A lot of people talk shit about them and hate on them.
[01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.890]  They're amazing.
[01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:39.770]  That's my friend that was doing it.
[01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:44.970]  Uh, um, he didn't have the flip box, but, um, he had two different ballast.
[01:39:44.970 --> 01:39:48.930]  So he was, you know, one was on for 12 hours and it was on for 12 hours.
[01:39:49.210 --> 01:39:49.650]  Same thing.
[01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:52.210]  Just, uh, he just had the extra ballast.
[01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:53.370]  I didn't want to go buy another one.
[01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:57.250]  You know, I was like, that flip box was the price of another ballast and everything.
[01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:59.090]  So I was like, I'll just do it this way.
[01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:00.890]  And it was, it's kind of a test idea.
[01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:03.970]  I wanted to see if I could do that on a larger scale because I've designed.
[01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:05.610]  An 18 light room.
[01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:08.930]  That's two nine room or two nine light rooms on a flip box.
[01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:13.050]  Uh, and then I actually did some research and a guy named Eric Bicksa
[01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.570]  kind of beat me to the punch on this room that I was trying to build.
[01:40:15.970 --> 01:40:17.290]  So it's a cool room.
[01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:20.770]  It's a 10 by 10 room with a 10 by five long room in the middle.
[01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:24.370]  And all of your equipment is in that middle room and you cool off all of the
[01:40:24.370 --> 01:40:26.290]  air in the middle room and one side sleeps.
[01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:29.570]  So you're producing CO2 in the sleeping plants, guys, plants that are asleep.
[01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:30.410]  Kick off CO2.
[01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:32.930]  If you can vent that CO2 into your flower room, that's awake.
[01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:34.050]  You can use that.
[01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:37.490]  Uh, but so yeah, you're just, you got one air conditioner, one set of
[01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:40.610]  ballast, one dehumidifier, and then you're just moving the air around in both rooms.
[01:40:40.690 --> 01:40:41.250]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:42.130]  Killer idea, guys.
[01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:42.930]  We'll talk about that.
[01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:43.730]  That's a huge room.
[01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:44.490]  That's a lot of money.
[01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:46.770]  That's like multi-thousand dollar room.
[01:40:47.170 --> 01:40:49.770]  So some of you guys are going to grow like in closets and shit.
[01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:50.410]  That's what I'm saying, right?
[01:40:50.410 --> 01:40:52.050]  Some of you guys are going to grow and grow huts.
[01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:54.610]  Some of you guys might even bust out 16 lights in a basement.
[01:40:55.090 --> 01:40:58.210]  However, uh, however you do it, there will be some obstacles presented
[01:40:58.210 --> 01:40:59.730]  by your existing environment.
[01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:00.930]  That's how it goes.
[01:41:00.930 --> 01:41:03.570]  Unless you're building a building that's designed to be a
[01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:04.770]  grow space from the beginning.
[01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:06.810]  You're going to have to deal with some type of obstacles.
[01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:08.770]  That's part of the fun for me, honestly.
[01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:09.970]  Yeah, no, totally.
[01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:10.170]  Yes.
[01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:10.450]  Yeah.
[01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:14.370]  I like taking a space like a dirty basement or a funky attic or the back
[01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:19.370]  part of the dispensary and making it an amazing, sufficient grow with the space
[01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:23.450]  and power that I've got without having to do any crazy dramatic improvements to the
[01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.850]  place.
[01:41:23.890 --> 01:41:25.170]  It's kind of a fun challenge.
[01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:29.370]  I, uh, I think I, no, I don't think I know.
[01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:36.010]  Um, I do upgrades after every single run, sometimes upgrades that slow me down quite
[01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:36.290]  a bit.
[01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:36.690]  Yeah.
[01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:40.170]  I've noticed you've had some downtime for a minute.
[01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:41.130]  I've heard you talking about it.
[01:41:41.730 --> 01:41:42.090]  All right.
[01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:45.090]  So let's talk about a few things that every grow will need.
[01:41:45.170 --> 01:41:47.930]  Uh, there will be more things you're going to have to add to this, depending
[01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:51.810]  on your room and your space, but every room is going to need these things.
[01:41:51.810 --> 01:41:54.570]  This is mostly for, uh, just one flowering room.
[01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:55.330]  If you want to have.
[01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:58.570]  Plants of vegging while your crop flowers, you're going to need a small
[01:41:58.610 --> 01:41:59.010]  bedroom.
[01:41:59.010 --> 01:42:03.370]  Also, uh, eventually you're going to want a mother room and a clone area and a
[01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:08.050]  veg area and a breeding area and a place for your male plants and a place to make
[01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:13.410]  pollen and it gets ridiculous when you start doing it a whole bunch, but
[01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:15.010]  eventually you're going to want to add more rooms.
[01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:19.970]  My advice is build slowly and plan ahead with realistic expectations.
[01:42:20.370 --> 01:42:22.410]  Uh, don't start counting your chickens before they hatch.
[01:42:22.690 --> 01:42:25.770]  If you've got a light and you expect a pound of weed, start thinking you got
[01:42:25.770 --> 01:42:29.170]  three quarters of a pound of weed and budget for that because you're not going
[01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:32.290]  to grow as great as you plan your first couple of runs.
[01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.930]  So make your upgrades.
[01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:36.770]  Like Jesse said, he makes upgrades every time kind of plan them.
[01:42:37.410 --> 01:42:41.770]  Don't go too ambitious your first couple of times, like be realistic about it.
[01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:47.210]  You can fail crops, fail, uh, things that kill crops, spider mites,
[01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:49.090]  air conditioner failure.
[01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:51.930]  If your air conditioner cuts out in the middle of a flower cycle and you're at
[01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:54.890]  work and it's 90 degrees outside and you're going to come home and it's going
[01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:58.250]  to be 108 degrees in your girl room and you're going to have crispy buds.
[01:42:58.250 --> 01:42:59.810]  They're already dried and cured for me.
[01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:03.290]  That shit happens.
[01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:07.050]  Uh, if you're running a hydro setup, if one pump dies while you're at work or
[01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:09.650]  while you're asleep, everything can go crunchy.
[01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:11.090]  Don't get me started on that.
[01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:11.770]  Yeah, it's happened.
[01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:15.490]  I know I have, we have a mutual friend that went to Las Vegas for two days.
[01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:19.410]  Uh, he was, he was supposed to go to a wedding and didn't want to go, but he had
[01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:22.770]  to go and there was like a five day vacation planned, but he went for two days.
[01:43:22.770 --> 01:43:26.290]  He flew there and flew back right away and came home and his pump took a shit
[01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:30.250]  while he was gone and his whole four by four table, yeah.
[01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:31.070]  Yeah.
[01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:38.570]  We had a, uh, double redundancy set up, you know, two pumps, um, and, uh, on a
[01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:43.290]  set up at a dispensary and both failed the same weekend by everyone was at the
[01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:43.930]  cannabis cup.
[01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:44.850]  Oh man.
[01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:45.290]  Yeah.
[01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:45.970]  Goodbye.
[01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:47.490]  Two tables worth of weed.
[01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:48.690]  Two whole tables.
[01:43:49.770 --> 01:43:49.970]  Yeah.
[01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:50.650]  See, thank you.
[01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:51.130]  Good job.
[01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:51.710]  Yeah.
[01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:53.410]  No, I've been trying that for a while too.
[01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:55.330]  Cannabis, cannabis.
[01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:55.870]  Yeah.
[01:43:55.890 --> 01:43:56.890]  It just sounds like a better word.
[01:43:56.970 --> 01:43:57.970]  You know, yeah.
[01:43:58.410 --> 01:43:58.910]  Herb.
[01:43:58.930 --> 01:43:59.770]  I call it herb a lot.
[01:43:59.770 --> 01:44:00.570]  It's a Rasta in me.
[01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:01.210]  It's a good herb.
[01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:02.730]  Um, yeah.
[01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:04.650]  So we're talking about things that all grows need.
[01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:05.490]  Uh, yeah.
[01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:07.490]  Everything, every grow is going to need electricity.
[01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:07.890]  Duh.
[01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:08.170]  Right.
[01:44:08.170 --> 01:44:10.050]  Unless you're growing outside, you need electricity.
[01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.570]  You're going to need lights and timers.
[01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:16.250]  Uh, you'll need intake and outtake fans and you're going to need a water source.
[01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:18.450]  Those are the basics that every girl will need.
[01:44:19.130 --> 01:44:21.090]  Um, and we're at 40 minutes.
[01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:23.850]  I'm going to try to squeeze as much of this in as we can, but we might not
[01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:28.450]  actually even get to like, might not get to the build part until another episode.
[01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:31.810]  Um, cause I have another episode planned that is just, I've
[01:44:31.810 --> 01:44:33.290]  had news articles set aside.
[01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:35.690]  I've got a couple of things Mike and I wanted to talk about.
[01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:40.010]  It's going to kind of go between these two build episodes, I think, but I might
[01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:41.610]  put it out as like a midweek episode.
[01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:44.770]  So I think after we record here, Mike's going to come over and bullshit with
[01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:46.090]  me again and talk about some things.
[01:44:46.330 --> 01:44:49.690]  So the next one will be a news heavy catch up episode, and then I'll try to
[01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:53.250]  get Jesse back as soon as possible to talk more about building, because you're
[01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:54.650]  going to send me so many questions.
[01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:55.290]  I can already tell.
[01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:59.010]  Um, yeah, we love the questions.
[01:44:59.010 --> 01:44:59.930]  That means we're doing our job.
[01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:02.290]  If we spark your thoughts, that means we're doing our job.
[01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:05.890]  Uh, Hey LB, you asked me questions and I appreciate it.
[01:45:05.890 --> 01:45:07.610]  I hope I responded appropriately.
[01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:09.970]  I don't want to say your full name because I haven't gotten your permission,
[01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.570]  but LB, I appreciate you for listening.
[01:45:11.610 --> 01:45:12.170]  That's awesome.
[01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:15.250]  So, uh, lights, everybody needs lights.
[01:45:15.250 --> 01:45:17.490]  Lights are actually the main ingredient to your growth space.
[01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:19.930]  Uh, lights dictate the cycles of the gardens.
[01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:23.650]  Uh, they tell you if you're in veg or if you're in flower, uh, lights are also
[01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:28.450]  the main fuel and energy provider for your plants, lights, create photosynthesis.
[01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:29.890]  Lights are the main thing.
[01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:31.690]  It's the number one nutrient.
[01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:32.470]  Yes.
[01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:36.370]  Uh, put as big of a light as you can in your space is what I always say.
[01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:39.090]  And a lot of them.
[01:45:40.210 --> 01:45:43.610]  Uh, so no matter how big or small your growth space is, you will need some
[01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:45.090]  sort of air exchange system.
[01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:46.210]  Always.
[01:45:46.210 --> 01:45:48.770]  You got to get rid of that old stale, funky air.
[01:45:49.410 --> 01:45:51.690]  Um, I can't stress how important this is.
[01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:54.810]  Most of the problems I see from low budget grows is a lack
[01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:56.530]  of airflow and air exchange.
[01:45:56.930 --> 01:46:00.250]  Um, moving the air around the room is great, but you need to replace
[01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:02.210]  the, uh, room, the air in the room.
[01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:05.650]  Also, uh, if you leave a freshly watered crop locked in a sealed
[01:46:05.650 --> 01:46:08.690]  closet with a light above it, you're treating a very humid environment.
[01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:12.250]  Uh, the plants are trying to transpire, but there's too much moisture in the air.
[01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:15.210]  The plants can't sweat like they should, which slows down
[01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:17.170]  photosynthesis and stones growth.
[01:46:17.610 --> 01:46:19.730]  It also makes your plants look angry and sad too.
[01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:23.130]  Uh, if the plants are left in excessive humidity for long periods, they will
[01:46:23.130 --> 01:46:27.930]  become very susceptible to our good friend, powdery mildew, FU powdery mildew.
[01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:34.130]  Uh, as your buds grow, your risk of powdery mildew way increases
[01:46:34.130 --> 01:46:35.250]  the insides of your buds.
[01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:37.650]  If you're not getting some airflow in there and you got too much moisture
[01:46:37.650 --> 01:46:40.810]  in the room, that mold is going to grow right in the middle of your buds.
[01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:45.570]  So lock yourself in your car one day, just lock yourself in the car on the sun
[01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:47.570]  and just try to sit in there and breathe for the whole day.
[01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:49.890]  That's what it feels like for your plants when you just stifle
[01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:51.010]  them locked up in a tight room.
[01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:52.130]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:46:52.570 --> 01:46:52.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:54.730]  So we've stressed the need for air exchange.
[01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:59.090]  Uh, water, water should be easily accessible.
[01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:03.170]  Uh, I predict that your South, each thousand watt light will require about
[01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:08.770]  five gallons of water, two to three times a week, and this works, uh, across the board.
[01:47:08.770 --> 01:47:15.130]  I like to put a 16, three gallon pots under the light, or I like to put nine,
[01:47:15.130 --> 01:47:20.250]  five gallon pots or between four and six, seven gallon pots underneath a thousand
[01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:25.290]  watt light, and either way, I find that that requires about five gallons
[01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:26.650]  of water for each watering.
[01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:27.250]  Yeah.
[01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:28.170]  Yeah.
[01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:29.890]  That's a real good estimate actually.
[01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:30.250]  Yeah.
[01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.690]  Yeah.
[01:47:31.090 --> 01:47:31.930]  I'm glad that works out.
[01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:35.290]  So keep that in mind that you guys are going to have to get water to your
[01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:40.050]  grow space at least twice a week, unless you set up a drip system, uh, laid in
[01:47:40.050 --> 01:47:44.250]  flower, and if your room is a little hotter, you may be watering three or four
[01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:45.090]  times a week.
[01:47:45.170 --> 01:47:46.930]  I'm hitting my plants as a little cool now.
[01:47:46.930 --> 01:47:48.010]  So I'm hitting a Monday.
[01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:49.530]  I hit them with nutrients real heavy.
[01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:52.370]  And then I try to hit them on Thursday or Friday with just enough
[01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:53.890]  water to keep them through Monday.
[01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:57.370]  But since they haven't been drinking a lot, that means that on their next day,
[01:47:57.370 --> 01:48:00.410]  when they get just water, I'm going to really water the shit out of them to
[01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:03.410]  kind of wash out any excess nutrients that have built up over time.
[01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:07.330]  And then we'll start refeeding the soil again, uh, around day 30.
[01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:09.650]  I really pummel them with a lot of sugars and things.
[01:48:10.410 --> 01:48:14.410]  And smaller plants will use water a lot more often too.
[01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:17.050]  Dude, that mic stand is fired after his performance tonight.
[01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:19.610]  We have a mic stand that needs Viagra.
[01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:21.050]  We'll swap it out for that one over there.
[01:48:21.090 --> 01:48:22.690]  Sorry about giving you the shitty mic stand.
[01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:23.410]  It's all good.
[01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:25.370]  We got to talk to our sponsors about this.
[01:48:26.610 --> 01:48:29.250]  Uh, if you guys are interested in sponsoring the I Grow Culture podcast,
[01:48:29.290 --> 01:48:31.530]  email me, I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:32.690]  I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:34.850]  I'll send you a one sheet if that's what you're looking for and let you
[01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:35.730]  know what my rates are.
[01:48:36.170 --> 01:48:40.490]  Uh, we've been hitting, dude, we've been hitting between 3000 and 5000
[01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:41.570]  listeners per episode.
[01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:42.810]  5000 is our peak.
[01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:45.410]  2500 is like our low on an episode now.
[01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:46.210]  Jesus.
[01:48:46.250 --> 01:48:48.090]  That's, that's how many people are here in this show.
[01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:50.090]  So thank each and every one of you that are listening.
[01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.970]  That is awesome.
[01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:51.450]  Yeah.
[01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:52.290]  Thank you guys.
[01:48:52.650 --> 01:48:52.970]  All right.
[01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:56.010]  I feel like we've talked about the very basics of building a room.
[01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:59.290]  We talked about setting a goal for how much cannabis we need to grow.
[01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:01.170]  I wrote herb right here, but I corrected myself.
[01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:05.050]  Uh, the next step is figuring out if you're building your room to fit your
[01:49:05.050 --> 01:49:08.930]  production needs, or if you're building the room to fit the available space,
[01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:12.170]  budget, and electrical limitations.
[01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:14.930]  Uh, sometimes you can't always throw a 24 lights in your basement
[01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:16.210]  because you can't pull that many amps.
[01:49:16.210 --> 01:49:19.370]  So find a happy medium that lets you grow a few crops.
[01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:23.850]  And then, uh, see if this is something that you can dedicate more time
[01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:25.170]  and space and electricity to.
[01:49:25.610 --> 01:49:28.930]  And then after a couple of crops, expand your grows, plan them out.
[01:49:29.650 --> 01:49:31.210]  Uh, but don't expand more quickly than you can learn.
[01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:31.930]  I keep saying that.
[01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:34.850]  Imagine this, imagine getting ahead of yourself will cause
[01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:35.730]  you headaches in the future.
[01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:41.730]  Imagine if you have 24 lights in flower with six, seven gallon pots under each
[01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:45.170]  light, and now you have fungus gnats and it's your first grow and you're
[01:49:45.170 --> 01:49:48.130]  like four weeks into flower and you can't spray, because if you spray,
[01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.610]  you're going to put shit in your buds, but you've got to get rid of those
[01:49:50.610 --> 01:49:52.530]  fungus gnats and you got a whole lot of them.
[01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:54.770]  You just spent, if you got 24 lights,
[01:49:55.010 --> 01:49:56.530]  It's like 150 plants.
[01:49:56.850 --> 01:50:01.250]  Oh, that should be 24 to 30 pounds of wheat.
[01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:02.010]  If you do this, right.
[01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:04.850]  Some guys are going to get 48 pounds of weed out of these 24 lights.
[01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:07.530]  If you're running some OG Kush or girls got cookies, you're hoping
[01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:09.050]  for those 25 pounds out of that.
[01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.450]  And now you may have to cut it down four weeks in.
[01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:13.210]  You got to do it.
[01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:14.530]  What if you got spider mites in there?
[01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.970]  I'm cringing.
[01:50:16.650 --> 01:50:18.290]  So what I'm saying is start small, dude.
[01:50:18.650 --> 01:50:22.690]  Uh, fail small before you fail so large, because when you grow, you're going to
[01:50:22.690 --> 01:50:23.050]  fail.
[01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:24.890]  Uh, I mess up at this rate.
[01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:28.890]  I still kill stuff on accident, like all the time, but that's the only way I learn.
[01:50:28.890 --> 01:50:30.530]  I encourage a little bit of experiment.
[01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:31.810]  Don't experiment on your moms.
[01:50:31.810 --> 01:50:33.450]  Don't experiment on your patients.
[01:50:33.450 --> 01:50:36.610]  Important crop, pick a plant, torture it, see what you can do to it.
[01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:42.570]  But go small, like experience a few problems before you try to battle fungus
[01:50:42.570 --> 01:50:43.890]  gnats in a 24 light flower.
[01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:45.250]  All right.
[01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:47.610]  We are 47 minutes in.
[01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:50.450]  I'm not sure if we should try to keep going or if we should save this next
[01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:53.370]  part for another episode, because we're, uh, we kind of got them on the
[01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:54.690]  edge of their seats right now.
[01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.410]  Yeah.
[01:50:56.530 --> 01:50:59.330]  We'll talk about, we'll talk about this one spot right here.
[01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:03.850]  And then, uh, so we're gonna talk a little bit about room size in relation
[01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:05.890]  to how many and what type of lights do you use?
[01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:07.730]  We got about 10 minutes to do this.
[01:51:08.130 --> 01:51:09.970]  So a small closet set up.
[01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:13.810]  Uh, I would use some small T5 lights, little fluorescent lights.
[01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:18.090]  I personally don't like the coiled CFLs.
[01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:20.090]  I don't feel like they put out enough light.
[01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:22.010]  They weren't great as supplements.
[01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:24.730]  If it's all you got, that's going to, if it's all you've got and all you can
[01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:27.890]  power, it's going to work, but for the amount of heat that they put off, I
[01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:29.370]  don't think they put off enough light.
[01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:30.250]  I agree.
[01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:31.410]  Awesome.
[01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:35.770]  Uh, for a closet, I would almost recommend it's a T5 light.
[01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:40.210]  I think there are eight bulbs and I think it's 24 by 24 is the dimensions of it.
[01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:43.330]  Uh, and I think it's actually made by hydro farm.
[01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:46.490]  If you've got a small closet, that is the perfect light.
[01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:47.250]  In my opinion.
[01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:51.370]  Uh, if you can't run a lot of electricity, you can put that in a small fan and leave
[01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:52.810]  the closet cracked a little bit.
[01:51:53.130 --> 01:51:54.250]  You've got a grow room, dude.
[01:51:54.730 --> 01:51:57.410]  As long as you're getting that stale air out of there and not letting it get too
[01:51:57.410 --> 01:52:00.970]  hot, keep the, those T5 lights right above your plants.
[01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:04.810]  And then every night you got to close that closet door at the same time and turn off
[01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:06.490]  your light to start your flower cycle.
[01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:09.930]  And you got to be on the money eight o'clock, eight o'clock every day and night.
[01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:13.530]  But so in a small closet, I think that little T5 light I'm talking about is
[01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:17.570]  perfect, or maybe a small HID, a high intensity discharge light.
[01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:20.370]  Uh, maybe like a one 50 in a closet.
[01:52:20.730 --> 01:52:23.570]  I really like a 250 watt high pressure sodium light.
[01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:25.130]  I really find those to be efficient.
[01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:27.210]  It's a great size light.
[01:52:27.210 --> 01:52:29.890]  Doesn't take a lot of wattage, but it does make a little bit of heat.
[01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:35.530]  Even, um, you know, if your closet's a little bigger, 400s are great.
[01:52:35.730 --> 01:52:36.210]  That's great.
[01:52:36.330 --> 01:52:37.490]  That's exactly what I wrote down.
[01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:40.650]  I was going to say a 400 is kind of the biggest you really want to go in a closet
[01:52:40.650 --> 01:52:44.250]  unless you got like one of those fancy, like Bel Air walk-in closets.
[01:52:45.450 --> 01:52:48.210]  Uh, but everyone's got a small closet they can dedicate to a grow space.
[01:52:48.210 --> 01:52:51.730]  So if you're just trying to supply herb for you and your girlfriend or something,
[01:52:52.330 --> 01:52:55.570]  just you, the closet is fine, especially with the little T5 light.
[01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:57.770]  I think you could pull some, some stuff out of a T5.
[01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:00.010]  Is that where your first grow was at?
[01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.930]  The closet?
[01:53:01.890 --> 01:53:05.090]  Uh, technically yes, it was in a closet, but inside of that
[01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:06.610]  closet, I put a grow hut in there.
[01:53:06.650 --> 01:53:08.210]  It was kind of a large closet.
[01:53:08.290 --> 01:53:11.050]  It was more of a, uh, it was a closet that was actually attached
[01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:12.570]  to the hot water heater area.
[01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:14.930]  So the closet had another door in it.
[01:53:15.330 --> 01:53:20.050]  And I actually took the ducting from my hot water heater and my heater and
[01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:22.930]  used some of the CO2, uh, to my grow room.
[01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:23.850]  Yeah.
[01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:25.370]  That can be a little dangerous.
[01:53:25.410 --> 01:53:25.930]  Yes.
[01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:26.650]  That yeah.
[01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:27.530]  Yeah.
[01:53:27.570 --> 01:53:27.850]  Yeah.
[01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:28.370]  Yeah.
[01:53:28.730 --> 01:53:29.850]  Don't do that if you don't know what you're doing.
[01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:30.770]  Nice.
[01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:32.850]  Uh, so yeah, perfect little closet.
[01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:34.210]  Uh, it's a great way to grow.
[01:53:34.210 --> 01:53:35.490]  You can grow a little short plants in there.
[01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:36.490]  You can supply yourself.
[01:53:36.810 --> 01:53:37.490]  Oh yeah.
[01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:40.210]  A small corner of a room works.
[01:53:40.210 --> 01:53:45.330]  If you need to like tarp off a room or like if you have a small room that
[01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:48.250]  you can just take the corner, you can put a grow hut in the corner.
[01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:49.450]  Grow huts are awesome.
[01:53:49.450 --> 01:53:50.970]  I said, I'm going to do a whole talk about those.
[01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:52.330]  That will be another episode guys.
[01:53:52.330 --> 01:53:53.450]  We're at 50 minutes now.
[01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:56.250]  I've noticed you guys don't listen past 45.
[01:53:56.290 --> 01:53:58.570]  A lot of the, the listeners click out at 45 minutes.
[01:53:58.610 --> 01:53:59.530]  You're droning off.
[01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:02.530]  I mean, you're not droning on this.
[01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:07.890]  What I meant, it didn't mean, I mean, after, after a while, we, if we listen
[01:54:07.890 --> 01:54:10.010]  to the show, I can tell we run out of energy about an hour.
[01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:11.650]  It's like, Oh, my throat's done.
[01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:13.810]  All the listeners are getting drowsy.
[01:54:14.010 --> 01:54:14.370]  Yes.
[01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.650]  Okay.
[01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:16.770]  Well, yeah.
[01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:17.810]  And I don't blame you guys.
[01:54:18.130 --> 01:54:20.890]  Uh, so you got that small corner, small space.
[01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:25.610]  You can put a T five all the way up to like a 600 watt light and like a six
[01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:27.170]  by six space, if you can vent it.
[01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:29.730]  Uh, we'll talk in the next episode.
[01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:33.130]  Jesse is actually like a carpenter craftsman house builder, manly man.
[01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:35.610]  So he's going to talk about framing up a space and stuff.
[01:54:36.010 --> 01:54:39.050]  Uh, in the next episode, we're going to try to get this part done quickly here.
[01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.810]  Grow huts.
[01:54:40.170 --> 01:54:41.450]  I will talk a lot about them.
[01:54:41.890 --> 01:54:44.130]  Uh, you can put a grow hut in the corner of any room.
[01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:46.130]  You can put multiple grow huts in a basement.
[01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:49.490]  Um, you can put one grow hut in every room.
[01:54:49.690 --> 01:54:53.010]  If you've got limited power, find out where each room is on each breaker
[01:54:53.050 --> 01:54:54.650]  and put one grow hut on each breaker.
[01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:57.890]  You can grow plenty of cannabis in one house or one location.
[01:54:58.050 --> 01:54:59.250]  Sounds like my kind of place.
[01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:01.570]  I think I've been to houses like this.
[01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:04.730]  Uh, then of course there's the whole dedicated bedroom.
[01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:09.010]  If you've got a nice bedroom that nobody needs, if you're a single guy and your
[01:55:09.010 --> 01:55:13.090]  roommate sucks, kick him out and build a grow room, he won't eat your food.
[01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:14.490]  He won't bring over ugly chicks.
[01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:16.010]  You got to grow room in there now.
[01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:19.010]  That's going to produce dank cannabis and it will pay for itself.
[01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:23.090]  Uh, something I should write down to talk about is the cost of running the grow
[01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:25.290]  room because that's just on my mind.
[01:55:25.690 --> 01:55:25.890]  Huh?
[01:55:26.010 --> 01:55:27.970]  I had more paper here and I don't know where the note I wrote earlier went,
[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:34.570]  but we'll write that expensive, uh, big grow rooms, big facilities and stuff like
[01:55:34.570 --> 01:55:38.250]  that, astronomical electricity bills.
[01:55:38.370 --> 01:55:42.010]  But imagine if, uh, if imagine if you and I were roommates and you kicked me out
[01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:44.810]  and built a grow room in my space, it would definitely pay for itself in the
[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:48.890]  long run and it wouldn't eat your freaking Ben and Jerry's.
[01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:50.850]  It would get you high as crap in the end.
[01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:56.130]  So a whole room, you can put multiple, depending on the size of your room, if
[01:55:56.130 --> 01:56:00.610]  you've got, so I say like every six by six, four by four, four by four to six by
[01:56:00.610 --> 01:56:02.850]  six space, you should put about a thousand watt light.
[01:56:02.850 --> 01:56:03.690]  If you can vent it.
[01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:07.010]  Now, if you've got a room that's like 10 by 10, I think you should
[01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:08.650]  put 4,000 while lights in there.
[01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:09.090]  Yeah.
[01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:12.770]  Uh, if you're getting bigger and bigger, I, it kind of depends on your wattage and
[01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:17.290]  stuff, but about every five by five square should be a thousand watt light.
[01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:19.890]  If you can vent that, I try to leave.
[01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:21.410]  People hate walkways.
[01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:24.250]  A lot of growers say that walkways are expensive and a waste of space.
[01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:27.810]  I like giving myself a walkway so I can get to every single plant.
[01:56:28.210 --> 01:56:30.250]  And I think the plants like the space to breathe.
[01:56:30.730 --> 01:56:33.410]  Uh, you don't like being crowded in on the bus with everybody touching you.
[01:56:33.810 --> 01:56:35.090]  Your plants don't like that shit either.
[01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:37.930]  Give them some room to breathe and keeping the leaves off of each other will
[01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:42.170]  prevent powdery mildew and places for bugs to jump around.
[01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:47.770]  So if you've got a whole room, put up 1000 watt light, every five by five space
[01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:51.690]  up to the limit that your electricity will allow and that you can cool.
[01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:54.330]  Um, here's a random recommendation.
[01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:58.770]  I think it's about 3000 BTU use of cooling for every single thousand
[01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:00.610]  watt light is what I think you want.
[01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:02.810]  2,500 to 3000.
[01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:03.250]  Okay.
[01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:07.410]  So keep that in mind when you're, and you have to power that air conditioner also.
[01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:14.130]  So in your big room here, if you've got, uh, And your 30 and your two 30 amp
[01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:17.410]  breakers, you're going to be able to run one, maybe two lights and an air conditioner.
[01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:21.450]  That's going to be about it on a 30 amp breaker.
[01:57:21.450 --> 01:57:24.850]  So you're going to need an, uh, an electrician to come wire up your big room.
[01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:25.210]  Yeah.
[01:57:25.210 --> 01:57:27.050]  You're not going to be able to get the air conditioner on that.
[01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.690]  Most likely.
[01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:32.130]  Uh, if you've got a big garage or a basement, you need to have the
[01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:35.050]  electrician come and wire you up with two 40 in the whole basement.
[01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:40.010]  And then you need to have a mini split put in the basement and hang like
[01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:41.970]  24 lights down there in your basement.
[01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:44.330]  And you gotta have an HVAC guy come set that up.
[01:57:45.010 --> 01:57:45.370]  Yeah.
[01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:47.370]  And yeah, they're fun.
[01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:48.090]  Yeah.
[01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:50.370]  That mini split is going to be fun to put in, but man, you can keep
[01:57:50.370 --> 01:57:51.810]  it so cool once you get it there.
[01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:55.330]  And then the next step up from there, uh, after you have your basement or your big
[01:57:55.330 --> 01:57:59.490]  garage with multiple thousands, uh, anything more than nine lights, I think
[01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:03.930]  becomes like kind of extensive for a home grow, like, yeah, if you got like
[01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:06.970]  10 lights in a house, you're kind of pushing it, but then you move on to
[01:58:06.970 --> 01:58:10.210]  like the commercial scale warehouses where you've got multiple rooms with
[01:58:10.210 --> 01:58:14.210]  multiple thousand watt lights or one giant room with a hundred lights in it.
[01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:16.050]  I kind of prefer more separated rooms.
[01:58:16.650 --> 01:58:17.530]  I like to breed.
[01:58:17.570 --> 01:58:20.330]  And if something goes wrong in one room, you don't have it everywhere.
[01:58:20.410 --> 01:58:20.570]  Yeah.
[01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:21.650]  It's a little more containable.
[01:58:22.810 --> 01:58:25.810]  So my main point is plan the room before you start building.
[01:58:25.890 --> 01:58:28.650]  Uh, think about how many lights you want to run.
[01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:30.490]  Think about how much cannabis you want to produce.
[01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:32.730]  Uh, think about your electrical limitations.
[01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:33.730]  Think about your budget.
[01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:34.690]  It's going to cost you.
[01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:38.610]  We said about a hundred bucks a month to run a light and its accessories.
[01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:40.610]  So keep that in mind until harvest.
[01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:43.970]  You're not going to have, uh, you're going to have to figure out how to pay for that.
[01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:46.410]  Once harvest comes, then you obviously have a way to pay for that.
[01:58:47.210 --> 01:58:49.210]  Uh, we're going to be at an hour real quick here, guys.
[01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:51.450]  This is a good way to make this a two part episode.
[01:58:51.690 --> 01:58:55.490]  The part we're going to come up with next is actually the basic steps to building
[01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:58.610]  the room and some guidance on building a room and things to look for.
[01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:02.650]  Uh, I'm going to cut this episode off right here and we'll make that part two.
[01:59:03.570 --> 01:59:04.890]  Uh, dude, thanks for coming to do it.
[01:59:04.890 --> 01:59:05.890]  Another great episode.
[01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:06.970]  We just crushed this one.
[01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:10.450]  I feel like, yeah, um, we kind of droned on for a little bit.
[01:59:10.650 --> 01:59:12.850]  I feel like I've been talking for an hour straight, so I
[01:59:12.850 --> 01:59:14.130]  apologize if this got boring.
[01:59:14.130 --> 01:59:16.970]  I hope you guys learned a whole bunch of stuff this time.

[01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:24.450]  Jesse grows OG on Twitter.

[01:59:52.730 --> 01:59:52.970]  Yeah.

[02:00:09.450 --> 02:00:12.250]  Uh, don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, stitcher,
[02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:14.170]  I read genetics, colorado.com.
[02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:16.770]  And I am still working on adding videos to YouTube.
[02:00:16.770 --> 02:00:18.010]  I took a break from that for a minute.
[02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:21.010]  I was kind of busy this week, but they will still come up there.
[02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:21.530]  Dude.
[02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:23.770]  I want to give a huge shout out to the garden of Whedon.
[02:00:23.890 --> 02:00:25.370]  Huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:00:25.650 --> 02:00:26.650]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:28.130]  Thanks again for listening to you guys.
[02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:29.010]  Take a fat dad.
[02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:30.490]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:10.420]  Yeah.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:11.740]  What's going on podcast world.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:14.700]  Welcome to episode number 38 of the I grow culture podcast.
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.780]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.660]  Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:21.700]  I'm coming to you today, November 1st, the day after Halloween.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:25.420]  And I am proud to report that nobody gave any trick or
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:27.580]  treaters, cannabis infused candy.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:28.540]  I'm proud of you guys.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.500]  And I want to say, thanks.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:32.100]  We've got a little bit of a news article here that I want to read.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.460]  If I can get it to pop up.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:34.140]  Hello.
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:35.260]  All right.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:36.340]  We've got a news article here.
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:38.620]  It is from the Denver associated press.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:42.620]  The high, uh, the headline is Halloween pot candy, scare baseless.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:46.940]  So far, the article says police in Colorado have warned parents to look
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:50.300]  out for pot laced Halloween candy, but parents don't seem too worried.
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:54.300]  A Denver based testing company offered a thousand free kits to parents
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:57.620]  wanting to screen their trick or treaters hall for marijuana psychoactive chemical.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:02.380]  However, only 45 parents took CBC, CB scientific up on the offer.
[02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:05.620]  As of Friday, there have been no reported cases of people slipping
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:09.220]  marijuana into unsuspecting, unsuspecting trick or treaters in
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:11.020]  Colorado or in any other state.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:15.140]  But the popularity of pot candies in the new retail market in Colorado
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.900]  prompted warnings this fall from police in Denver, Fort Collins, and Pueblo.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:23.780]  As of Halloween morning, Denver police and the Rocky mountain poison and
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:26.740]  drug center reported no calls about marijuana and Halloween candy.
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:30.980]  My honest opinion is that it's an overblown fear that was created by the
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:33.740]  police said CB scientific CEO bill short.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.020]  The company's $15 kits are usually used by medical marijuana patients
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.620]  to test the potency of their weed.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:43.220]  The kits include small beakers and a liquid that turns reddish in the
[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:45.980]  presence of THC marijuana's active ingredient.
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:47.620]  I'm going to jump in here.
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.820]  Uh, marijuana does not have ingredients.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:52.460]  Marijuana is a plant, so you don't need ingredients to mix
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:53.540]  it together and make a plant.
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.180]  Uh, but nice try.
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:58.900]  Uh, short said the free kits were available to parents anywhere, but that
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:01.060]  nearly all the requests came from Colorado.
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:03.420]  We stepped in to tell parents don't be spooked.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:07.580]  We're not trying to jump on some fear mongering bandwagon short said since
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:11.220]  January children's hospital, Colorado has reported nine admissions for children
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.060]  accidentally consuming edible marijuana.
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:17.060]  It's unclear whether those cases were from homemade treats or edible marijuana
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:19.300]  purchased products sold at dispensaries.
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:22.740]  Colorado police have said they're just trying to boost awareness because of
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:24.620]  a wider availability of pot candies.
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:28.700]  The Larimer County Sheriff's department, for example, said in its warning that
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:33.020]  vigilance is necessary because marijuana candies don't necessarily appear unusual.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:37.100]  THC infused edibles are often designed to look very similar to popular
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:38.700]  name brand treats the office warned.
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:42.540]  In Washington state, the other state with legal, sorry, I'm gonna
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.580]  start that sentence over again.
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:47.140]  In Washington state, the only other state with legal recreational pot sales,
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:48.980]  authorities have been more circumspect.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:53.340]  A sheriff's detective in Pierce County, Washington wrote a newspaper column
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:56.740]  saying pot showing up in trick or treat bags is an urban myth.
[02:03:57.300 --> 02:03:59.500]  It's too, it's too expensive, hard to get.
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:01.900]  And users of these products are pretty laid back and not generally
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:02.900]  terrifying in nature.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:04.980]  The detective said my page just refreshed.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.660]  Let me scroll back down to where I was.
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:08.700]  There's something going on with my internet where I am today.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:11.500]  So, uh, I may lose my connection a couple of times, but we will,
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:13.060]  we will make that happen.
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:14.420]  Where was I now?
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.100]  It's too expensive.
[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:16.620]  It's hard to get.
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:19.780]  And these guys are laid back and generally not terrifying in nature.
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:22.380]  Detective Ed Troyer wrote Monday in the Tacoma weekly.
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.740]  And you know, I think, uh, I think Ed's got the right idea.
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:25.540]  It's too expensive.
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:30.900]  First of all, edibles at a dispensary are kind of expensive and people that are
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:33.060]  buying and using cannabis, we're not Trump.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:33.740]  We're not mean.
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:35.580]  Most of us are not mean spirited people.
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:36.860]  We don't want to play tricks on people.
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:38.220]  We don't want to give people cannabis.
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:42.620]  And I think most of us have realized that if we do that, we are
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:44.300]  fighting down our own movement.
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:48.060]  So my point here is that I'm glad nobody gave anybody, uh, any
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:50.420]  cannabis infused candies over Halloween.
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:53.140]  My other point is that that's a lot of hype and a lot of fear.
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:56.500]  So if you guys are believing that relax a little bit, it's not, uh, it's not
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:58.500]  as big of a fear as we thought it was.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:01.060]  So I hope everybody had a happy and safe Halloween.
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:05.340]  I am going to, uh, continue with this next news article and
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:06.380]  then we'll do a couple of ads.
[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:07.700]  This one's kind of related.
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:11.140]  Part of that article that I just read said that, um, a lot of edibles are
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:15.340]  designed to look like popular candies, but, uh, no more.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:19.580]  This article comes from the Denver post and it is written by David Magoya.
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:24.140]  The headline says ganja joy, no more Colorado edibles firm, settle
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:26.140]  suit over Hershey lookalikes.
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:31.100]  Uh, the article says the small Colorado Springs based producer of marijuana
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:34.700]  edibles sued in June by candy giant, the Hershey company for allegedly
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:38.700]  breaching a number of design and name patents quietly settled the dispute.
[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:42.500]  And a settlement pendant late September tincture bell agreed to recall
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:43.700]  and destroy all edibles.
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:47.180]  It's sold that looked like the famed chocolate company's products or with
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:48.860]  names that played on their brands.
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:53.380]  Though the edibles company said it had long ago stopped making products that
[02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:57.060]  appeared like those products by Hershey, including well-known names, such as
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:01.340]  Reese's almond joy and Heath long before the federal lawsuit was filed in June
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:05.100]  in us district court in Denver, the settlement makes sure it won't happen again.
[02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:09.460]  So these guys were making edibles and some of them were delicious, dude.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:13.820]  Uh, they make a reefers peanut butter bar that looks just like the Reese's
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.740]  peanut butter bar, but it says reefers on it.
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:20.340]  Uh, the packaging was the same color as the Reese's peanut butter cups.
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:21.740]  It looked very similar.
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:24.660]  So I could see why Hershey's kind of got pissed at this.
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:28.580]  Um, the Heath was, uh, I forgot what they called the Heath bar.
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:33.820]  Uh, but these can candy bars look just like the original candy bar.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:34.740]  And that could cause a problem.
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.900]  I could see that if your kid saw that sitting on the counter, which that
[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:42.020]  shit should not be sitting out for a kid to get, but if he saw that reefers bar
[02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:45.460]  sitting up there, that kid would probably eat it and that kid would be wrecked and
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:49.100]  you'd be a shitty parent and then you'd be, but another mark of one of those kids
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:51.820]  in the hospital for cannabis and you'd make the whole movement look bad.
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.300]  So, uh, the settlement also requires tincture bell not to use the product
[02:06:55.300 --> 02:07:02.340]  names, hashies, ganja, joy, hash, he hash heats thingamajiggy or, and reefers,
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:05.300]  nor to use the name reefer for any candies that contain either
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:06.940]  peanut butter or its flavorings.
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:11.420]  The company also agreed not, uh, not to make packages with brown,
[02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:14.900]  yellow, and orange colors, which are those used by Reese's brand, according
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:16.060]  to a copy of the statement.
[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.700]  So now they can't even use any of the colors.
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:20.260]  Hershey pretty much a cock block.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.380]  These guys pretty well from doing anything like that.
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.940]  Uh, Hershey's and Hershey's had said tincture bells, products,
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:29.620]  harm their brand name, and could be confused for regular candy by children,
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:30.620]  which is kind of what I was saying.
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:34.300]  A tincture bell, neither admitted nor denied any allocations in the
[02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:35.740]  lawsuit as part of the settlement.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:39.620]  You're not going to be able to get your ganja joy or your reefers anymore.
[02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:41.820]  Those were super popular in California.
[02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.580]  It took them a little bit to get their way out here to Colorado, but
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:46.140]  we are not going to see that anymore.
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:46.860]  Guys.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.540]  I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.060]  I'm fired up for this podcast.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:50.740]  I've had a good day.
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:52.220]  It's a super nice day outside.
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:56.820]  I got a big package in the mail from our friends at sweet leaf farms.
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.100]  So I want to give them a big shout out.
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:58.580]  Thank you.
[02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:00.220]  Go check out sweet leaf farms.
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:01.740]  I'm going to take a dab, dude.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:04.540]  Uh, hopefully I'll slow down and calm down just a little bit.
[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:05.580]  So take a dab with me guys.
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:12.220]  I'm going to dab some, uh, Scotts OG and sins OG mix grown by a garden of
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:16.660]  Wheaton and also extracted by garden of Wheaton, uh, the stuff is super delicious.
[02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:21.700]  Uh, it's what won the, uh, the secret cup five or the secret cup, uh, regionals
[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:26.060]  in Denver, but this is the shatter version and not the live resin version.
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:28.620]  Let's take a dab.
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:29.860]  I got a big fat, chunky dab here.

[02:09:03.490 --> 02:09:04.730]  Just a little bit of a cough there.
[02:09:04.730 --> 02:09:05.570]  I tried not to cough in your ear.
[02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:06.090]  I'm sorry guys.
[02:09:06.410 --> 02:09:06.690]  All right.

[02:11:39.690 --> 02:11:40.450]  It's titanium, right?
[02:11:40.650 --> 02:11:42.770]  I got the highly educated infinity nail.

[02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:50.690]  I love it because it works perfectly for my email coil over here to the right of
[02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:50.930]  me.

[02:11:53.050 --> 02:11:56.490]  That's got an 18, 14 millimeter duality nail.
[02:11:57.050 --> 02:12:00.370]  And then over here in this little container, I've got the master shake rig

[02:12:10.170 --> 02:12:12.170]  I've got six carb caps on the table right now.
[02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:13.650]  Got a couple of the regular ones.

[02:12:36.130 --> 02:12:37.490]  You guys want to do another article.
[02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:39.410]  Let's read another news article.
[02:12:40.410 --> 02:12:41.130]  This one sucks.
[02:12:41.130 --> 02:12:42.450]  You guys saw this in Denver.
[02:12:42.690 --> 02:12:45.610]  Uh, this was a real popular topic a few days ago here in Colorado.
[02:12:45.610 --> 02:12:46.690]  Everybody was talking about it.
[02:12:47.370 --> 02:12:49.890]  Uh, it says this is from the cannabis is where I'm reading it.
[02:12:49.930 --> 02:12:50.250]  Let's see.
[02:12:50.250 --> 02:12:51.210]  Where was it originally?
[02:12:51.210 --> 02:12:54.930]  This is from Jesse Paul and Noel Phillips and John Engle of the Denver post.
[02:12:55.130 --> 02:12:59.010]  The headline is Denver police and feds conduct large scale
[02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:01.130]  raids on marijuana grow sites.
[02:13:01.330 --> 02:13:03.010]  Let's get into this article and then we'll talk about it.
[02:13:03.930 --> 02:13:07.530]  Denver police officers, some in hazmat suits, raided multiple marijuana
[02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:10.730]  growing operations Tuesday, part of an investigation into illegal
[02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:12.250]  marijuana sales in Minnesota.
[02:13:12.650 --> 02:13:16.450]  A federal law enforcement official said federal agents assisted in the
[02:13:16.450 --> 02:13:20.210]  raids, which saw investigators haul dozens of high intensity grow lights
[02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:22.370]  and thousands of plants out of the operations.
[02:13:22.810 --> 02:13:26.130]  The federal official said as much as $1 million was found in large
[02:13:26.130 --> 02:13:27.450]  bags during the searches.
[02:13:28.370 --> 02:13:31.450]  The official who was not authorized to disclose information about the case
[02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:34.450]  and spoke to the associated press on the condition of a non-admitted.
[02:13:34.450 --> 02:13:37.370]  I, I really chopped that word.
[02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:38.290]  Anonymous.
[02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:39.010]  Anonymous.
[02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:41.010]  I can't even say I'm reading it and can't do it.
[02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:42.090]  Anonymous.
[02:13:42.170 --> 02:13:42.690]  Anonymous.
[02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:48.890]  He spoke anonymously, uh, believe people involved came to Colorado from
[02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:51.930]  Minnesota where marijuana is illegal outside of a restrictive medical
[02:13:51.930 --> 02:13:56.210]  marijuana program, officially authorities released little information about the
[02:13:56.210 --> 02:14:00.370]  case on Twitter, Denver police wrote that the investigation involved illegal
[02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:04.330]  drug activity, but a spokesman for the department later said he did not know
[02:14:04.330 --> 02:14:07.850]  if the operations rated were licensed marijuana businesses or if detectives
[02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:09.810]  believe they were exclusively illegal.
[02:14:10.690 --> 02:14:14.010]  Denver police did not announce any arrests connected to the raids.
[02:14:14.210 --> 02:14:17.890]  The spokeswoman for the state marijuana enforcement division, which regulates
[02:14:17.890 --> 02:14:21.090]  cannabis businesses, refused to comment on whether the division was
[02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:22.450]  involved in the investigation.
[02:14:23.170 --> 02:14:26.690]  Likewise, James Goeth, group supervisor of the drug enforcement
[02:14:26.690 --> 02:14:30.050]  administration, special support unit in Denver offered little comment.
[02:14:31.050 --> 02:14:33.210]  It's a very large and successful investigation.
[02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:38.450]  Both said I have one rated site, a North Bryant street near west sixth Avenue.
[02:14:38.650 --> 02:14:42.010]  A Denver police officer was seen entering a building in a blue hazmat suit.
[02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:46.210]  The officer, his, his suit reeking of marijuana said several search warrants
[02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:47.730]  were being executed around the city.
[02:14:48.530 --> 02:14:52.810]  The rated building on North Bryant street is in, is in an industrial area, popular
[02:14:53.050 --> 02:14:56.410]  with state legal commercial marijuana growers and increasingly illegal
[02:14:56.410 --> 02:14:58.130]  growers trying to hide among them.
[02:14:58.130 --> 02:15:01.570]  The rated address was once home to the girl operation for a medical marijuana
[02:15:01.570 --> 02:15:05.170]  products business that wrecked state records show, but it is unclear whether
[02:15:05.170 --> 02:15:06.490]  the small business is still there.
[02:15:07.210 --> 02:15:10.370]  Cannabis industry insiders said they believe the address is now occupied by
[02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:13.970]  people claiming to be medical marijuana caregivers, smaller scale providers
[02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:15.290]  that operate with less scrutiny.
[02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:18.410]  At neighboring cannabis business, employees were bewildered by
[02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:19.770]  the flurry of police activity.
[02:15:20.730 --> 02:15:24.730]  Nate Perrini, who works at edibles manufacturer, ed appear, which is next
[02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:29.130]  door to the rated operation on North Bryant street said cops already were there
[02:15:29.130 --> 02:15:30.490]  when she got to work around 9.
[02:15:30.490 --> 02:15:31.970]  Yeah, they're getting rated.
[02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:33.970]  She said, Oh, I've seen that.
[02:15:33.970 --> 02:15:36.690]  I've seen, Oh man, I've seen somebody about to get raided.
[02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:39.930]  Not somebody I knew, but there was a house in my neighborhood a few weeks ago.
[02:15:39.930 --> 02:15:42.210]  There were just vehicles like a block away.
[02:15:42.210 --> 02:15:44.330]  And then you could see one car driving right towards the house.
[02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:45.450]  I was like, yeah, that's just going down.
[02:15:45.450 --> 02:15:46.210]  They're about to get raided.
[02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:47.290]  It's such a weird feeling.
[02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:50.210]  Anyway, a police car was parked in front of the shop and another was
[02:15:50.210 --> 02:15:51.450]  parked in the alley behind it.
[02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:55.530]  Tuesday's raids came 11 months after local and federal authorities
[02:15:55.530 --> 02:15:57.410]  raided several large marijuana businesses.
[02:15:58.210 --> 02:16:01.570]  The largest raids on Colorado pop businesses, excuse me, since
[02:16:01.570 --> 02:16:02.930]  medical marijuana became legal.
[02:16:03.450 --> 02:16:05.130]  Four people connected to the businesses.
[02:16:05.610 --> 02:16:08.890]  Rated then have been charged with federal crimes and prosecutors have
[02:16:08.890 --> 02:16:13.050]  also moved to the C's businesses have moved to seize the businesses assets.
[02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:18.570]  So, uh, I don't for the record, I don't know if I've ever been
[02:16:19.130 --> 02:16:24.490]  so, uh, I don't, from what I have read and seen recently and what's going on on
[02:16:24.490 --> 02:16:30.810]  Facebook, these facilities were not legal medical marijuana, MED registered facilities.
[02:16:31.090 --> 02:16:35.410]  These were caregivers who have kind of vague rules, but they were
[02:16:35.490 --> 02:16:37.210]  probably out of their plant count.
[02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:39.810]  And if they had that much money on them, they were doing something
[02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:40.890]  that they shouldn't have been doing.
[02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:45.370]  Um, a friend of mine on Facebook said that he saw at least a hundred
[02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:48.210]  lights stacked up outside of one of these facilities.
[02:16:49.090 --> 02:16:51.170]  And imagine being the guys that work at ed appear.
[02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:56.290]  So the where, like the warehouse right here got raided and the one right next
[02:16:56.290 --> 02:17:00.330]  to it did not, and the one on the other side of it did not, and everyone's in
[02:17:00.330 --> 02:17:04.850]  there growing herb and you see all these federal agents and hazmat suits pull up.
[02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:06.810]  And just start taking shit apart.
[02:17:06.810 --> 02:17:08.090]  And they come in with guns blazing.
[02:17:08.090 --> 02:17:08.610]  I'm sure.
[02:17:09.330 --> 02:17:09.730]  Oh man.
[02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:12.890]  Imagine having the legal business next door and you didn't get raided and
[02:17:12.890 --> 02:17:15.730]  you're just sitting there, shit in your pants, waiting for them to come into your
[02:17:15.730 --> 02:17:16.010]  spot.
[02:17:16.010 --> 02:17:16.730]  You're like, what do I do?
[02:17:16.930 --> 02:17:17.370]  What do I do?
[02:17:17.370 --> 02:17:20.610]  Eventually you're like, just come in already because you're so freaked out.
[02:17:20.610 --> 02:17:22.090]  You don't know what you're waiting for anymore.
[02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:23.290]  Oh man.
[02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:25.370]  But from what I've seen, these places were not legal.
[02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:29.370]  So this wasn't the feds taking down medical marijuana facilities.
[02:17:29.370 --> 02:17:32.330]  This was actual raids on illegal grows.
[02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:35.210]  And I know that sounds weird being in Colorado, but there are a lot of these
[02:17:35.210 --> 02:17:36.930]  large scale illegal grows going on.
[02:17:38.170 --> 02:17:39.730]  I bet they'll keep taking them down too.
[02:17:41.370 --> 02:17:41.690]  All right.
[02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:42.850]  I've got another article.
[02:17:43.850 --> 02:17:49.810]  This one is, uh, this one I found on, where did I find this?
[02:17:49.810 --> 02:17:51.090]  This is from Tok of the town guys.
[02:17:51.090 --> 02:17:53.090]  That's I look at the cannabis, the Tok of the town.
[02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:55.330]  I look at a lot of websites to find my cannabis news.
[02:17:55.810 --> 02:18:00.130]  Um, unfortunately you have to type in the word marijuana to find good cannabis news.
[02:18:00.130 --> 02:18:01.090]  I'm trying to change that.
[02:18:01.130 --> 02:18:01.890]  Here's a reminder.
[02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:03.770]  Marijuana is a racist word.
[02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:05.330]  It was created with racism.
[02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:07.810]  Uh, it supports a racist connotation.
[02:18:07.850 --> 02:18:10.890]  So we're going to stop saying marijuana and let's all say cannabis.
[02:18:11.490 --> 02:18:13.370]  Uh, cannabis is the revolutionary term.
[02:18:13.970 --> 02:18:17.370]  Uh, the people before us, the older folks are afraid of marijuana.
[02:18:17.370 --> 02:18:18.610]  They're not as afraid of cannabis.
[02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:20.210]  We've kind of, it's all about the words.
[02:18:20.650 --> 02:18:23.490]  If you say the right words, you can convince people just about anything.
[02:18:23.530 --> 02:18:26.010]  So let's start saying cannabis and not saying marijuana.
[02:18:27.170 --> 02:18:31.130]  The headline of this article, Georgia drug agents bust man with
[02:18:31.170 --> 02:18:33.210]  Okra and believe it is marijuana.
[02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:34.370]  It's kind of an old story.
[02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:35.450]  Some of you guys might've heard about it.
[02:18:35.450 --> 02:18:36.650]  It's from Mike Adams.
[02:18:37.770 --> 02:18:40.490]  The article says, oh, this is really long.
[02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:41.890]  We might summarize some of this.
[02:18:42.690 --> 02:18:46.970]  Americans are no longer safe to cultivate common garden vegetables without risking
[02:18:46.970 --> 02:18:48.570]  the violent wrath of the drug war.
[02:18:49.090 --> 02:18:52.970]  No other citizen understands this lunacy quite like Georgia resident, Duane
[02:18:52.970 --> 02:18:56.890]  Perry, who told reporters that he was raided by drug agents earlier last week
[02:18:56.930 --> 02:19:01.170]  after an aerial surveillance unit mistook his Oprah crop for marijuana.
[02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:02.250]  That's right.
[02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:05.650]  It appears as though Georgia law enforcement has not had enough experience
[02:19:05.650 --> 02:19:09.650]  taking down marijuana grow operations to distinguish the difference between
[02:19:09.730 --> 02:19:11.490]  Okra and the cannabis plant.
[02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:14.010]  Dude, there is a picture of an Okra plant here.
[02:19:14.410 --> 02:19:17.890]  Um, does not look at all like pot to me.
[02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:20.130]  It's got big round leaves.
[02:19:20.130 --> 02:19:21.570]  The leaves are not serrated.
[02:19:21.570 --> 02:19:23.050]  It doesn't have the fingery leaves.
[02:19:23.050 --> 02:19:24.170]  It doesn't look like a hand.
[02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:27.570]  Uh, doesn't look like weed at all.
[02:19:28.210 --> 02:19:29.890]  Uh, train these guys a little more.
[02:19:30.450 --> 02:19:31.850]  So I'm going to summarize this article.
[02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:35.330]  Reports indicate that a drug task force was conducting a marijuana suppression
[02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:38.570]  mission when officers spotted Perry's Okra plants and immediately thought
[02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:39.490]  he was growing weed.
[02:19:40.090 --> 02:19:44.490]  Okra plants incidentally consist of five fat leaves while the cannabis plant has
[02:19:44.490 --> 02:19:46.730]  very distinguishable foiling foliage.
[02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:49.410]  They spelled foil a drop foliage wrong here.
[02:19:49.410 --> 02:19:52.330]  They put F O I O L I H.
[02:19:53.730 --> 02:19:54.770]  That's my brain all up.
[02:19:55.090 --> 02:19:57.730]  In other words, the two plants look absolutely nothing alike.
[02:19:58.530 --> 02:20:01.770]  Unfortunately that did not stop officers with Georgia state patrol from
[02:20:01.770 --> 02:20:03.410]  swooping in on Perry's residents.
[02:20:04.770 --> 02:20:06.530]  Dressed to kill is what it says here.
[02:20:06.810 --> 02:20:09.690]  In an attempt to destroy the suspected marijuana growing in his backyard.
[02:20:09.730 --> 02:20:13.050]  They were strapped to the gills, said Perry, explaining to reporters how the
[02:20:13.050 --> 02:20:16.570]  officers seemed prepared to shoot him dead on the spot over a case of mistaken
[02:20:16.570 --> 02:20:17.050]  identity.
[02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:21.010]  Oh man, these cops went in and raided this guy.
[02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:24.330]  Imagine when you get raided, it's traumatic.
[02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:27.570]  Uh, I've been involved in a couple of raids, unfortunately, knock on wood.
[02:20:27.970 --> 02:20:29.090]  I'm never in one of those again.
[02:20:29.530 --> 02:20:30.570]  The cops come in there.
[02:20:30.610 --> 02:20:32.130]  You could, they're coming into your home.
[02:20:32.170 --> 02:20:33.490]  You can have an AK 47.
[02:20:33.490 --> 02:20:34.250]  You could have a bomb.
[02:20:34.250 --> 02:20:35.170]  You could have dogs.
[02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:37.530]  You could be crazy as shit and they're coming in.
[02:20:38.050 --> 02:20:40.410]  They are prepared for whatever you're doing in there.
[02:20:40.530 --> 02:20:41.330]  And it's scary.
[02:20:41.530 --> 02:20:43.610]  They put you on the ground, they cuff you, they put a gun to your head.
[02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:44.450]  They talk shit to you.
[02:20:45.210 --> 02:20:48.170]  Uh, if you're doing some kind of crime or in a house where there's some shit
[02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:50.970]  going on, you might expect that you might be the type of person that's prepared
[02:20:50.970 --> 02:20:51.290]  for that.
[02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:53.810]  You may have had police interaction and you know how to handle yourself.
[02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:57.690]  This dude is a okra grower in Georgia.
[02:20:58.010 --> 02:20:59.330]  I'm pretty sure he's not.
[02:20:59.810 --> 02:21:02.450]  Uh, experienced with the SWAT team and the state patrol.
[02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:04.450]  So he probably shit his pants when they came in.
[02:21:04.890 --> 02:21:07.650]  Probably traumatized him, probably traumatized his family.
[02:21:08.490 --> 02:21:11.570]  Now, if there are any kids there, they're scared shitless of the cops now.
[02:21:12.010 --> 02:21:12.770]  So let's get a little more.
[02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:14.850]  I skipped a couple of little short paragraphs.
[02:21:14.850 --> 02:21:18.170]  Although Perry is grateful that a trigger happy cop did not riddle him
[02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:19.210]  full of holes during the raid.
[02:21:19.210 --> 02:21:23.090]  He says there is no excuse for this level of domestic warfare over a plant.
[02:21:23.650 --> 02:21:26.890]  Here I am at home and retired and you know, I did the right thing.
[02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:30.170]  Said Perry, they come to my house strapped with weapons for no reason.
[02:21:30.810 --> 02:21:31.450]  It ain't right.
[02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:36.170]  Several officers did apologize after further investigating the plant, but
[02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:39.610]  that simply isn't good enough, says Perry, because the situation could have
[02:21:39.610 --> 02:21:42.450]  potentially gotten him killed or seriously injured more.
[02:21:42.450 --> 02:21:43.130]  I thought about it.
[02:21:43.210 --> 02:21:44.050]  What could have happened?
[02:21:44.050 --> 02:21:45.850]  He said, anything could have happened.
[02:21:46.850 --> 02:21:48.130]  So I'm going to wrap up that article.
[02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:50.410]  Good job, Georgia police.
[02:21:50.850 --> 02:21:51.370]  Good job.
[02:21:51.370 --> 02:21:53.650]  I bet that, uh, I bet that made you feel good.
[02:21:53.650 --> 02:21:55.170]  I bet that was a good way to spend your money.
[02:21:55.170 --> 02:21:58.170]  I bet you scared the shit out of this old retired guy for no reason.
[02:21:59.170 --> 02:22:01.690]  Instead of making friends, the cops keep making more enemies
[02:22:01.690 --> 02:22:02.810]  by doing shit like this.
[02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:05.650]  If you'd put down your guns and quit trying to be soldiers and just be
[02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:08.850]  friends and police the community, like we designed the police for, you'd
[02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:10.410]  have a lot more damn friends, I think.
[02:22:11.130 --> 02:22:14.490]  And then when shit goes wrong, the cops would have somebody to talk to.
[02:22:14.530 --> 02:22:16.330]  They wouldn't have to like when shit goes wrong.
[02:22:16.330 --> 02:22:17.570]  Now everybody disappears.
[02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:19.970]  Nobody wants to talk to the cops because the cops are the bad guy.
[02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:21.210]  Now you're the good guy.
[02:22:21.210 --> 02:22:23.930]  Still, we'd want to talk to you because we know you'd help us.
[02:22:24.090 --> 02:22:26.050]  Now we don't feel like you're going to help us feel like you're going to kick
[02:22:26.050 --> 02:22:27.290]  my ass just for pulling me over.
[02:22:27.290 --> 02:22:27.970]  And it sucks.
[02:22:28.570 --> 02:22:30.010]  Shouldn't be scared to pull over.
[02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:31.570]  The cops are pulling me over.
[02:22:31.570 --> 02:22:32.570]  You're the guys I should trust.
[02:22:33.410 --> 02:22:34.210]  Anyway, I'm ranting.
[02:22:35.050 --> 02:22:37.650]  Uh, this is a ridiculous article.
[02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:39.330]  I saw this unfold on Facebook.
[02:22:39.370 --> 02:22:40.730]  This was highly entertaining.
[02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:43.490]  This story is a little bit old, but it's well worth talking about.
[02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:45.050]  We haven't done any news on the show for a while.
[02:22:45.050 --> 02:22:46.610]  We've been packing up such great shows.
[02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:48.530]  Here's a funny article.
[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:50.170]  This one is by William breeds.
[02:22:50.930 --> 02:22:52.810]  Uh, the article is headlined idiot.
[02:22:52.850 --> 02:22:54.170]  Allegedly rips off pot.
[02:22:54.170 --> 02:22:56.210]  Grow, leave cell phone behind.
[02:22:56.530 --> 02:22:57.810]  We had a lot of fun with this one.
[02:22:57.810 --> 02:23:02.330]  You guys, this guy named Chris Mathers, uh, from Colorado.
[02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.770]  I'll just read the story.
[02:23:03.850 --> 02:23:06.490]  Chris Mathers is apparently a thief, but not a good one.
[02:23:06.650 --> 02:23:10.010]  We know this because the junkie scumbag left his smartphone behind earlier this
[02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:14.730]  week while allegedly ripping off a Colorado growers, outdoor garden, one of
[02:23:14.730 --> 02:23:16.650]  several he's allegedly burglarized.
[02:23:16.970 --> 02:23:20.090]  Now, thanks to social media, he's got the attention of local police.
[02:23:21.010 --> 02:23:24.850]  See this mastermind Mathers left his phone unlocked, which allowed the victim
[02:23:24.890 --> 02:23:28.730]  to pull up more than enough information on the scumbag to track him down and
[02:23:28.730 --> 02:23:30.370]  eventually get the cops involved.
[02:23:31.090 --> 02:23:34.690]  Details are hazy, mostly to keep the growers identity, identity, somewhat
[02:23:34.690 --> 02:23:38.170]  discreet, but after getting over the initial horror of seeing their harvest
[02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:42.570]  still weeks from being finished, gone, the owners of the growth were no doubt
[02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:46.330]  elated to find some rather concrete evidence leaking Mathers to their grow.
[02:23:46.570 --> 02:23:48.850]  No word on how Mathers would even know about the grow.
[02:23:48.850 --> 02:23:53.530]  It says in parentheses, after figuring out that the guy left his phone, his
[02:23:53.530 --> 02:23:57.090]  cell phone open for anyone to use, the grower handed things over to the social
[02:23:57.090 --> 02:23:57.490]  media.
[02:23:57.810 --> 02:24:00.330]  Here's a post from one of the growers friends.
[02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:03.610]  It says my friend's outdoor was ripped last night.
[02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:05.090]  One of the rippers dropped his phone.
[02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:09.050]  I'm going to post his profile below and his buddy that was involved found out
[02:24:09.050 --> 02:24:10.050]  through reading messages.
[02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:11.490]  Please hit me up if you know them.
[02:24:11.770 --> 02:24:12.970]  And quickly it escalated.
[02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:16.930]  I actually saw these posts on Facebook and it was real.
[02:24:16.930 --> 02:24:21.130]  It was like, it's like watching a real soap opera or a reality show happen on
[02:24:21.130 --> 02:24:22.330]  Facebook all day.
[02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:28.770]  So it says the victim pulled photos of a passed out Mathers, his address, phone
[02:24:28.770 --> 02:24:33.250]  number, and even a list of other grow ups he had allegedly ripped off while the
[02:24:33.250 --> 02:24:36.370]  growers no doubt had the inclination to go beat his head in.
[02:24:36.730 --> 02:24:38.530]  They wisely called the cops.
[02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:43.570]  After all pot is a legal thing to grow in this state and this is outright theft.
[02:24:44.290 --> 02:24:48.370]  So there was a lot of talk on Facebook about people just going and whipping this
[02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:50.450]  guy's ass because we had his home phone number.
[02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:51.330]  We had his address.
[02:24:51.330 --> 02:24:52.570]  We knew all of his friends.
[02:24:53.530 --> 02:24:54.570]  He was in deep shit.
[02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:59.330]  But like this article says, it's legal to have cannabis in this state.
[02:24:59.850 --> 02:25:01.130]  So they called the cops.
[02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:04.970]  And I'm pretty sure this guy was arrested for this, but let's read the article.
[02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:08.370]  It says for his part, Mathers sounds like he's near rock bottom.
[02:25:08.450 --> 02:25:12.130]  The grower was able to pull up text message conversations about Mathers
[02:25:12.410 --> 02:25:16.690]  Suboxone habit, stuff he used to get off heroin or oxys as well as other pill
[02:25:16.690 --> 02:25:17.650]  popping adventures.
[02:25:18.730 --> 02:25:20.410]  That and he normally smokes dirt weed.
[02:25:20.410 --> 02:25:23.810]  Apparently the grower found photos of the brick bullshit he sells for 50 and
[02:25:23.810 --> 02:25:25.770]  ounce donations on Mathers Facebook account.
[02:25:25.810 --> 02:25:29.090]  You guys should see this or this guy was selling some do do weed.
[02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.610]  It's brick.
[02:25:29.610 --> 02:25:30.450]  It's nasty.
[02:25:30.890 --> 02:25:36.170]  Uh, it looks, uh, there are not, it looks like little piles of cow shit or
[02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:36.570]  something.
[02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:38.450]  It does not look smokable to me.
[02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:42.690]  So this guy gets, he goes and steal somebody's crop dude.
[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:44.450]  And he drops his cell phone behind.
[02:25:44.890 --> 02:25:46.570]  People had a lot of fun with him on Facebook.
[02:25:46.930 --> 02:25:47.850]  We taunted him.
[02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:53.090]  I'm allegedly people taunted him and a lot of his friends all day long until he
[02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:54.770]  took down his entire Facebook page.
[02:25:55.450 --> 02:25:58.370]  And in the end he did end up getting arrested for stealing this crop, which
[02:25:58.370 --> 02:26:00.810]  is a justice and hilarious justice.
[02:26:00.810 --> 02:26:04.490]  If you ask me, let's read another ad because I've got one more ad that I've
[02:26:04.490 --> 02:26:05.330]  got to read for you.
[02:26:05.330 --> 02:26:08.530]  This podcast is brought to you in part, in part by our good friends at
[02:26:08.530 --> 02:26:12.610]  tree thugger.com tree thugger.com live music lifestyle magazine.
[02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:17.850]  Check out tree thugger.com for concert and festival news and reviews.
[02:26:17.850 --> 02:26:20.930]  www.tree thugger.com.
[02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:24.330]  Not going to rant too long on this one, but man, how about that Halloween fish
[02:26:24.330 --> 02:26:24.570]  show?
[02:26:24.570 --> 02:26:26.210]  Has anybody paid any attention to that?
[02:26:26.650 --> 02:26:28.370]  I've been a fish kid for years.
[02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:29.890]  Nothing like a good fish show.
[02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:32.090]  And that Halloween show was kind of crazy.
[02:26:32.370 --> 02:26:33.170]  How long have we been going?
[02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:34.970]  I feel like I've been ran for at least 20 minutes here.
[02:26:35.930 --> 02:26:37.570]  Look at that 25 minutes.
[02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:40.610]  Got another news article for you guys.
[02:26:40.610 --> 02:26:42.290]  This one is really silly.
[02:26:43.090 --> 02:26:46.010]  Um, I had to read this twice because I didn't understand.
[02:26:46.850 --> 02:26:49.970]  Uh, and then I took a couple of dabs, dude, speaking of dabs, let's take a
[02:26:49.970 --> 02:26:50.490]  dab together.
[02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:51.890]  What do you guys want to dab this time?
[02:26:51.890 --> 02:26:54.130]  I've got some, uh, some sour diesel nugg run.
[02:26:54.170 --> 02:26:55.370]  You want to take a dab of that?
[02:26:55.410 --> 02:26:56.610]  Let's hit some sour D.
[02:26:57.450 --> 02:26:58.250]  Let's get it going.
[02:26:59.090 --> 02:27:02.970]  I'm going to hit it on my blue, uh, highly educated carb cap.
[02:27:02.970 --> 02:27:07.770]  And we're going to dab out of the phase two with the infinity nail hooked up to
[02:27:07.770 --> 02:27:08.450]  the email.
[02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:09.570]  Email.
[02:27:09.570 --> 02:27:11.130]  You guys might not know what the email is.
[02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:15.490]  Uh, when you're dabbing, you got a titanium nail and usually you'll heat that with a
[02:27:15.490 --> 02:27:16.130]  torch, right?
[02:27:16.530 --> 02:27:19.010]  Heat it up for about a, until it's warm.
[02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:20.050]  I know about how warm I want it.
[02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:21.330]  You can almost touch the damn thing.
[02:27:21.330 --> 02:27:21.730]  I like it.
[02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:25.890]  So low temp, but, uh, if you don't want to use the torch all the time, you can buy an
[02:27:25.890 --> 02:27:27.890]  email and you plug the email into the wall.
[02:27:27.890 --> 02:27:28.770]  It's got a little box.
[02:27:28.770 --> 02:27:31.650]  You set the temperature on the box and it's got a cord that goes to the nail and the
[02:27:31.650 --> 02:27:35.530]  nail's got a little coil wrapped around it and it keeps your nail hot constantly.
[02:27:35.530 --> 02:27:38.410]  So you don't ever have to hear the torch on the podcast and you don't have to waste
[02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:40.170]  time with the torch and you just reach up and take a dab.
[02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:42.610]  So I'm going to, uh, I'm gonna take a dab.
[02:27:42.610 --> 02:27:43.210]  Join me guys.
[02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:43.770]  Dad with me.
[02:27:43.770 --> 02:27:44.090]  Here we go.
[02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:45.050]  Five, four, three.
[02:28:02.430 --> 02:28:02.870]  Yeah.
[02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:03.950]  Sour diesel nug run.
[02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:05.310]  That stuff tastes delicious.
[02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.750]  Oh man.
[02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:07.590]  Makes my head spin.
[02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.390]  Okay.
[02:28:10.430 --> 02:28:11.870]  Now let's read this crazy article.
[02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:15.030]  This other, this article is once again by our good friend, William breeds.
[02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:18.150]  I found this article on the toke of the town.
[02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:21.510]  They're going to have to stay with me because this one is kind of crazy.
[02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:22.750]  I need to drink before I go.
[02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:23.870]  That dad is kicking my butt.
[02:28:25.430 --> 02:28:25.950]  All right.
[02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:28.390]  This article headline says, and you're gonna have to pay attention.
[02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:32.790]  Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.910]  I'm going to say that again.
[02:28:35.390 --> 02:28:40.270]  Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:44.430]  The article says Don Willis wants to kill wolves.
[02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:48.030]  He also wants to be governor, but right now he's all about killing him some wolves.
[02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:51.310]  So much so that he's made it part of his campaign strategy.
[02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:55.910]  See Wyoming has permitted wolf hunts in the past, but this year a federal judge
[02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:59.950]  put the animals, a key component to the water ecosystem on a protected list.
[02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:04.870]  That pisses off Willis who has previously noted just wants wolves to die.
[02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:09.070]  Now, Willis is saying that the state should allow the hunt despite federal
[02:29:09.070 --> 02:29:11.630]  protection because Colorado has legal weed.
[02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:15.750]  The wolf tags have been issued and hunters had already made plans
[02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:16.510]  to start their hunts.
[02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:20.630]  He said the disruption to hunters, outfitters, and the cost Wyoming game
[02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:25.070]  and fish to refund hunting permits caused by a single black robe judge who
[02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:29.510]  sits in Washington, DC and has probably never been in Wyoming is outrageous
[02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:31.470]  and should be defied by Wyoming.
[02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.390]  Yes.
[02:29:32.390 --> 02:29:35.390]  Apparently you live in, you have to live in Wyoming to actually care
[02:29:35.390 --> 02:29:37.030]  about Wyoming's wolf population.
[02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:41.230]  Willis is now calling on hunters to go ahead and disobey the federal order.
[02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:45.190]  Colorado did just that in the legalization of pot.
[02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:49.990]  It's a federal crime to commercially grow pot and the state of Colorado
[02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:52.670]  defied the federal laws and it all worked out fine.
[02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:53.950]  He told the Billings Gazette.
[02:29:54.430 --> 02:29:57.830]  Well, carefully pointing out that he doesn't think people should break
[02:29:57.830 --> 02:30:01.110]  federal law to use cannabis, nor was he endorsing cannabis use.
[02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:05.310]  He also taunted the U S fish and wildlife service saying he doubted they would
[02:30:05.310 --> 02:30:09.310]  enforce the judge's ruling because they normally side with Wyoming on such matters.
[02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:14.150]  Current Wyoming governor Matt Mead agreed that the hunt should go on, but stop
[02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:18.830]  short of advocating, advocating people disobey the federal protections on animals,
[02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:21.510]  which are purely shot for trophy.
[02:30:22.470 --> 02:30:23.830]  Are they just shoot wolves for trophy?
[02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:28.870]  Uh, Wyoming has successfully negotiated against federal overreach and when
[02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:30.390]  necessary, they've gone to court.
[02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:35.710]  He said in a release, I do not advocate taking an extreme stand doomed to failure,
[02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:37.670]  which undermines Wyoming's interests.
[02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:41.350]  Instead of moving forward, the article goes on to say that they are going to
[02:30:41.350 --> 02:30:45.950]  pretty much monitor the amount of wolves and then they will, uh, reconsider
[02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:47.830]  lifting the, uh, the ban on wolf hunting.
[02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:50.470]  But I think this is funny that the governor is like, Hey man, they're
[02:30:50.470 --> 02:30:52.910]  smoking pot in Colorado and the feds ain't doing shit.
[02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.470]  So let's shoot our wolves in Wyoming.
[02:30:54.510 --> 02:30:56.270]  I bet the feds won't do shit.
[02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:58.870]  Um, I'm curious to see how that turns out.
[02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:59.590]  That's coming up.
[02:30:59.670 --> 02:31:02.310]  So, uh, I might pay attention to that.
[02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:05.430]  Chances are I will forget all about that.
[02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:09.510]  One thing I won't forget is a big shout out to our friends at
[02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:11.070]  hydro indoor growing supplies.
[02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:14.270]  I grow indoor growing supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.
[02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:18.670]  Check out the big Denver store at 62 71 beach street, or check out the
[02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:23.030]  Pueblo location at six 18 East fourth street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:27.310]  Make sure you check out hygro indoor growing supplies for competitive pricing
[02:31:27.310 --> 02:31:30.070]  and a great selection of indoor growing supplies.
[02:31:30.350 --> 02:31:32.470]  All right, guys, I have one more news article and then we're going
[02:31:32.470 --> 02:31:33.790]  to start wrapping up the show.
[02:31:34.270 --> 02:31:37.150]  I do plan to have Jesse back over in a couple of days and we're going to talk
[02:31:37.150 --> 02:31:38.630]  more about building your grow room.
[02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:40.630]  I have a couple of cool things lined up for you guys.
[02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:43.590]  We'll have an episode about growing in tents or hydro huts.
[02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:45.270]  Uh, there's a lot of great stuff coming up.
[02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:47.150]  So look forward to those episodes.
[02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:48.270]  I've got one more news article.
[02:31:48.270 --> 02:31:48.990]  Let me get to it.
[02:31:49.390 --> 02:31:53.430]  It says Colorado congressman urges Oregon to follow his state's
[02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:55.470]  excellent example on marijuana.
[02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:58.470]  So you guys in Oregon, the time to vote is coming up.
[02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:59.710]  Please go vote.
[02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:02.670]  If you're in Oregon, register to vote, go vote.
[02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:04.310]  You can't bitch and complain if you don't vote.
[02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:10.350]  The article says this Jared Paul has said in an op-ed Friday, uh, that
[02:32:10.390 --> 02:32:14.430]  marijuana legalization is sound policy and he urged Oregonians to follow in
[02:32:14.430 --> 02:32:18.270]  Colorado's footsteps and vote yes on recreational marijuana in next week's
[02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:22.710]  election, Colorado was approaching the first anniversary of legally regulated
[02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:24.390]  recreational marijuana for adults.
[02:32:24.390 --> 02:32:30.030]  Polis wrote in the bend bulletin, the implementation of our new laws has
[02:32:30.030 --> 02:32:33.790]  gone smoothly overall, providing an excellent example for other states to
[02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:37.590]  follow our success has made it clear that when marijuana is regulated like
[02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:42.470]  alcohol, it can decrease crime, help fund schools and drug education programs
[02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:45.510]  and keep money out of the hands of criminals and cartels.
[02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:47.510]  They got, I agree with most of that.
[02:32:47.950 --> 02:32:51.870]  Uh, Oregon voters are considering measure 91, which would allow adults to possess
[02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:56.470]  up to eight ounces of marijuana at home and up to one ounce in public taxes on
[02:32:56.470 --> 02:33:01.150]  marijuana sales would fund schools, law enforcement and drug prevention and
[02:33:01.150 --> 02:33:05.110]  education programs while Oregon, while the Oregon liquor control commission
[02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:07.270]  would regulate and monitor the industry.
[02:33:08.470 --> 02:33:09.390]  It sounds like it makes sense.
[02:33:09.390 --> 02:33:09.870]  Let's do it.
[02:33:10.390 --> 02:33:10.990]  I'm excited.
[02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:14.510]  Oregon will soon decide whether to join Colorado and Washington in regulating
[02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:19.110]  marijuana, like alcohol wrote Polis who previously sponsored legislation that
[02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:21.110]  would do just that at the federal level.
[02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:22.270]  More than ever.
[02:33:22.270 --> 02:33:26.350]  I believe it's time to change course on decades of failed marijuana prohibition
[02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:30.550]  and demonstrate viable, effective alternatives to address the realities
[02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:36.310]  of marijuana today, uh, Colorado's Colorado voters legalized recreational
[02:33:36.350 --> 02:33:41.630]  marijuana in 2012 with the first sales beginning on new year's day, 2014.
[02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:42.150]  Guys.
[02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:43.670]  I don't know if I've mentioned this on the show before.
[02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:45.310]  I'm sure I haven't been a smart ass.
[02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:48.510]  I was the first guy to buy recreational cannabis at the greener side
[02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:50.070]  dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:55.870]  I got there at like five 46 o'clock in the morning and sat in line and bought
[02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:59.350]  weed first at one of my good friends dispensaries and it made me proud.
[02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.910]  Anyway.
[02:34:00.310 --> 02:34:04.030]  Uh, while the rollout of the new regulatory regime has been, has not been
[02:34:04.030 --> 02:34:08.630]  perfect, it is largely been deemed a success voter support of the end of
[02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:13.110]  marijuana prohibit prohibition by a 10 percentage point margin in 2012
[02:34:13.430 --> 02:34:14.750]  and have continued to support it.
[02:34:16.110 --> 02:34:20.150]  Within the regulated marketplace, 10 teens appear to have been prevented
[02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:21.750]  from making illegal purchases.
[02:34:23.070 --> 02:34:26.510]  The legal sale of recreational and medical marijuana has been lucrative
[02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:30.910]  for the state generating about $30 million in taxes and fees.
[02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:35.030]  The Colorado legislation of Kent legislative council forecast that in the
[02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:39.830]  first full fiscal year of legal recreational sales, the state will rake
[02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:43.830]  in $47.7 million.
[02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:44.830]  That's a lot of money.
[02:34:45.630 --> 02:34:49.590]  If Oregon passes measure 91, the state's financial estimate committee
[02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:53.390]  projects that additional tax revenues could range from 17 million
[02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:55.550]  to $40 million annually.
[02:34:56.110 --> 02:34:59.990]  A recent study from the personal finance site, nerd wallet placed the forecast
[02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:04.870]  range for Oregon between 50 million and a hundred million dollars in tax revenue.
[02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:10.110]  Voters in Alaska and the district of Columbia will also decide whether to
[02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:13.830]  legalize recreational cannabis on November 4th.
[02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:15.430]  Guys, you know what I'm going to say?
[02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:19.790]  Go vote, go vote to legalize recreational cannabis.
[02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:26.470]  If you are in Alaska and the district of Columbia, you better be voting November
[02:35:26.470 --> 02:35:27.110]  4th.
[02:35:27.470 --> 02:35:29.310]  If you were in Oregon, go vote.
[02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:30.990]  You guys have to make this happen.
[02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.550]  All right.
[02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:33.510]  You can't bitch and complain if you don't vote.
[02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:35.870]  If you have a mail-in ballot, mail it in.
[02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:36.990]  November 4th is your day.
[02:35:36.990 --> 02:35:37.390]  All right.
[02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:38.030]  All right, guys.
[02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:40.830]  I feel like that's enough of me ranting and that's also enough news.
[02:35:41.310 --> 02:35:43.150]  I felt like I hadn't done a news episode in a while.
[02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:46.670]  I've been packing episodes really full of a lot of stuff and been leaving the news out.
[02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:49.590]  So let's start wrapping up the show guys who gets a shout out this week.
[02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:52.590]  I want to send a big shout out again to Sweet Leaf Farms.
[02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:54.630]  I want to send a huge shout out to Task Rock.
[02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:56.350]  Thanks for letting me play your music in the background.
[02:35:56.350 --> 02:35:57.910]  Right now you're listening to Task Rock.
[02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:59.030]  TNL the movement.
[02:35:59.550 --> 02:36:00.950]  Also a huge shout out to Angela.
[02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.670]  What's up girl?
[02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:06.150]  And also these guys don't pay for this advertisement, but a big, huge extra thank
[02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:08.270]  you to the Mate Factor in Manitou Springs.
[02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:12.230]  If you're ever in Manitou Springs and you need a vegetarian treat, stop in there.
[02:36:12.270 --> 02:36:13.990]  They've got great wraps and sandwiches.
[02:36:14.350 --> 02:36:16.950]  Get yourself a dark roast Mate.
[02:36:17.070 --> 02:36:18.390]  You'll be wired up for the whole day.
[02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:19.750]  Shout out to the Mate Factor.
[02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:20.870]  They always take good care of us.
[02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:23.750]  I drive an hour to go eat there and an hour back.
[02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:25.790]  So that's how good that place is.
[02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.150]  Uh, check me out in the next episode.
[02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:29.910]  Cause Jesse should be here if all goes well.
[02:36:30.390 --> 02:36:33.190]  Uh, we will talk more about building your grow room.
[02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:36.750]  Uh, then we'll have another episode that is not about building and then we'll do
[02:36:36.750 --> 02:36:39.750]  an episode about grow tents is what I think is coming up and then we'll start
[02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:43.270]  getting back on track about, uh, more grow lessons and stuff like that.
[02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:46.510]  So let's do the part where we wrap up the show.
[02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:47.790]  Where did I put that paper?
[02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:49.110]  It helps to be prepared.
[02:36:49.110 --> 02:36:50.710]  You guys, it goes like this.
[02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:53.830]  Hey, also, uh, I do need a theme song for the show so I can quit
[02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:55.430]  playing Task Rock and Nicotine.
[02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:57.470]  And that cheesy reggae song that I made.
[02:36:57.950 --> 02:37:02.110]  If you guys have any musical skills, I like dance hall, reggae, maybe a nice
[02:37:02.390 --> 02:37:04.150]  roots, reggae beat, something like that.
[02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:06.270]  You know, just something that's chill that I could play in the background
[02:37:06.270 --> 02:37:10.550]  while I talk, or maybe at the opening of the show, uh, I would appreciate it.
[02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:11.230]  I'm not begging.
[02:37:11.310 --> 02:37:11.990]  I'm just begging.
