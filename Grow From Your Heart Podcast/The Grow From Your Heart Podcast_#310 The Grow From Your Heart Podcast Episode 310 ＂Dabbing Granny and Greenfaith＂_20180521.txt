[00:01.530 --> 00:05.330]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.330 --> 00:08.330]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:08.330 --> 00:11.930]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:11.930 --> 00:14.630]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.630 --> 00:16.930]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:16.930 --> 00:21.530]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:21.530 --> 00:24.330]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:24.330 --> 00:29.130]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.130 --> 00:33.130]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.130 --> 00:37.530]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[00:40.930 --> 00:44.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong,
[00:44.330 --> 00:50.930]  or start heating up that dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:55.130 --> 00:59.030]  Welcome, podcast world. It's time for episode 310 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:59.030 --> 01:02.730]  Thanks again for joining me. This episode was a lot of fun to record.
[01:02.730 --> 01:05.430]  For this episode, I took White Mike up to Colorado Springs,
[01:05.430 --> 01:08.630]  and we went to the Green Faith Ministries Cannabis Church,
[01:08.630 --> 01:12.230]  and we were joined by Dabbing Granny, Reverend Brandon Baker,
[01:12.230 --> 01:14.730]  and a dude who calls himself IROC Watts.
[01:14.730 --> 01:18.630]  You guys, I don't want to ramble on too long in this intro, so let's just get right to it.
[01:18.630 --> 01:23.630]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dabbing Granny, White Mike, IROC Watts, Reverend Brandon Baker,
[01:23.630 --> 01:27.530]  and myself at the Green Faith Ministries Cannabis Church.
[01:27.530 --> 01:31.730]  All right, podcast world, we are here live at Green Faith Ministries in Colorado Springs.
[01:31.730 --> 01:36.130]  I'm joined on microphone by the always beautiful Dabbing Granny. Welcome to the show, sweetheart.
[01:36.130 --> 01:37.630]  Thank you for having me, Rasta Jeff.
[01:37.630 --> 01:39.630]  Thanks for putting this together for us.
[01:39.630 --> 01:41.030]  We're at a pretty cool place.
[01:41.030 --> 01:44.330]  This, I'm kind of impressed. We walked in, a young lady checked my ID.
[01:44.330 --> 01:47.030]  She told me to have a good time, and I am set up recording a podcast.
[01:47.030 --> 01:52.530]  I've had about 37 dabs, smoked some insert dabs. I smoked some hot nail dabs.
[01:52.530 --> 01:55.030]  This is a great place. Thanks for introducing me to this place.
[01:55.030 --> 01:58.030]  Well, I'm meeting the Rev for the first time myself, so.
[01:58.030 --> 01:59.530]  Well, then let's introduce the Rev to the show.
[01:59.530 --> 02:02.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, joining us on microphone number three over there is the Rev.
[02:02.530 --> 02:04.930]  They call him Rev Brandon Baker. Thanks for joining me on the show, bro.
[02:04.930 --> 02:06.030]  Thanks for having me.
[02:06.030 --> 02:08.630]  Thanks for having me. Thanks for inviting me to your church.
[02:08.630 --> 02:12.030]  Would you like to take a second and tell my audience about the church?
[02:12.030 --> 02:17.630]  We're a cannabis sacrament church, all denominational instead of non-denominational.
[02:17.630 --> 02:21.230]  I think it sounds better. Rastafarian based.
[02:21.230 --> 02:24.930]  We believe cannabis is the healing of the nation's tree life,
[02:24.930 --> 02:31.230]  and our mission is to get all other churches, no matter their path or faith,
[02:31.230 --> 02:34.830]  to believe that whatever their God is, that cannabis is the holy,
[02:34.830 --> 02:39.130]  holy, holy healing sacrament put here by him or her.
[02:39.130 --> 02:41.830]  Rastafari. Well, thanks for representing cannabis for us,
[02:41.830 --> 02:45.830]  and having a place where we can consume safely and not feel like we're in any danger.
[02:45.830 --> 02:48.730]  I'm totally comfortable here. This is cool. Thank you, man. I appreciate it.
[02:48.730 --> 02:50.730]  Nice and secure. Glad to have you here.
[02:50.730 --> 02:54.830]  Thanks, man. We'll definitely be back here. Also, on the microphone, a repeat offender.
[02:54.830 --> 02:57.030]  I brought him all the way to Colorado Springs. We got him out of the house.
[02:57.030 --> 02:59.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is on the show with me.
[02:59.030 --> 03:01.130]  What's up, everybody? Thanks for coming, dude.
[03:01.130 --> 03:03.830]  Thanks for taking some time away from the family to come be on the show.
[03:03.830 --> 03:07.130]  Dude, if you're going to get out once every six months, get out to this place.
[03:07.130 --> 03:09.630]  Yeah, this is a good time here. I feel I'm dabbed out,
[03:09.630 --> 03:11.930]  and I'm hanging out with a bunch of new friends and old friends. It's a good time.
[03:11.930 --> 03:14.630]  Right here on Constitution and Academy.
[03:14.630 --> 03:17.430]  Is there a social media page for this place?
[03:17.430 --> 03:22.630]  Green Faith Supply Company on Facebook is pretty much our main thing,
[03:22.630 --> 03:24.630]  where we keep people updated daily.
[03:24.630 --> 03:27.530]  Perfect. Check them out, you guys. If you're 21 and over and you're not an asshole,
[03:27.530 --> 03:29.530]  you can come here and you can participate in the church.
[03:29.530 --> 03:32.530]  You can be part of the crew. It's a really cool vibe.
[03:32.530 --> 03:34.630]  Everybody's here is super friendly.
[03:34.630 --> 03:38.230]  As for an extension cord, I took off running for an extension cord.
[03:38.230 --> 03:42.230]  They have emails. They have everything here to medicate.
[03:42.230 --> 03:46.430]  Everything is on a donation basis. Is that—?
[03:46.430 --> 03:49.930]  What we do is people, regular donating members,
[03:49.930 --> 03:53.930]  we give them reward points to cash in for church merchandise,
[03:53.930 --> 03:58.130]  whether it be sacraments or pipes, shirts, drinks, whatever.
[03:58.130 --> 03:59.530]  Beautiful. I like the artwork on the wall.
[03:59.530 --> 04:01.930]  I like the Native American vibe painting in front of me.
[04:01.930 --> 04:03.430]  Lots of great colors. Super chill vibe.
[04:03.430 --> 04:06.430]  I just noticed the people in the clouds. That is super cool.
[04:06.430 --> 04:08.030]  Great painting in front of me.
[04:08.030 --> 04:09.230]  One behind you as well.
[04:09.230 --> 04:12.630]  Nice Indian smoking a peace pipe there. Super cool vibe.
[04:12.630 --> 04:14.730]  It's not too hippied out, which is something that I like.
[04:14.730 --> 04:17.530]  A lot of places over-hippify the place, so it's super chill here.
[04:17.530 --> 04:21.030]  Yeah, all hand-painted by a patron, actually.
[04:21.030 --> 04:22.530]  Can you give them a shout-out?
[04:22.530 --> 04:26.030]  You can say their name if you'd like on the show.
[04:26.030 --> 04:27.330]  Go ahead, IROK.
[04:27.330 --> 04:30.530]  Oh, it's just Uncle Steve. He did all the artwork in here.
[04:30.530 --> 04:32.430]  Shout-out to Uncle Steve. Uncle Steve is a savage.
[04:32.430 --> 04:33.730]  Great painting. Much respect.
[04:33.730 --> 04:36.730]  That guy that just jumped in is a guy called IROKWATTS on Instagram.
[04:36.730 --> 04:38.830]  Check him out. Troll him. He'll troll you back.
[04:38.830 --> 04:41.130]  Don't worry. He may jump in once in a while.
[04:41.130 --> 04:42.730]  He said he didn't want to be on the show, but I knew he'd change his mind.
[04:42.730 --> 04:44.130]  We got him already.
[04:44.130 --> 04:45.430]  He's podcast adjacent.
[04:45.430 --> 04:47.030]  Three minutes. We got him in. He's just chilling out.
[04:47.030 --> 04:49.430]  He's keeping the dad nail hot. He's keeping us going.
[04:49.430 --> 04:52.030]  So, welcome to the show, everybody. I think we've introduced everybody properly.
[04:52.030 --> 04:55.030]  White Mike's here. The Reverend's here. Granny's here. Josh is here. I'm here.
[04:55.030 --> 04:58.330]  We're all hanging out, getting red-eyed, getting iry, getting medicated.
[04:58.330 --> 05:01.530]  Granny, we wanted to talk about some of your adventures.
[05:01.530 --> 05:04.430]  Let's start with your injury.
[05:04.430 --> 05:06.430]  Okay. There's two injuries, though.
[05:06.430 --> 05:07.730]  Two of them. Well—
[05:07.730 --> 05:10.230]  The first one was in Michigan.
[05:10.230 --> 05:14.030]  And if you notice, my glasses are all womp-eyed on my face.
[05:14.030 --> 05:15.830]  I was trying not to pay too much attention to your injuries.
[05:15.830 --> 05:17.930]  It hurts my feelings, so I wasn't paying too much attention.
[05:17.930 --> 05:22.130]  But I can laugh at myself because I've always said I'm a hazard to myself.
[05:22.130 --> 05:25.130]  Here we go. In Michigan, it was so cold.
[05:25.130 --> 05:26.630]  Ooh, it was freezing cold.
[05:26.630 --> 05:28.830]  It was colder than Colorado.
[05:28.830 --> 05:33.630]  And we're going to this Hash Bash Cup, and we couldn't park close.
[05:33.630 --> 05:35.730]  So I got out, and I'm running.
[05:35.730 --> 05:38.730]  And guys, if you know me, I am an Amazon.
[05:38.730 --> 05:42.530]  So if I'm running, there's a lot of force.
[05:42.530 --> 05:46.430]  And I look out of my eye, and I see the door is open to my left.
[05:46.430 --> 05:48.830]  I look in front of me, and the door is open.
[05:48.830 --> 05:51.330]  Wrong. Thump. Bounce.
[05:51.330 --> 05:54.330]  Right off a huge plate glass window.
[05:54.330 --> 05:55.930]  My glasses went—
[05:55.930 --> 05:57.330]  And there's people all around.
[05:57.330 --> 05:59.230]  The only person is Mama Bear Dab.
[05:59.230 --> 06:01.130]  She ran up to me, and she was like,
[06:01.130 --> 06:05.030]  Oh, I'm so glad that was you, because I would have done the same thing.
[06:05.030 --> 06:07.730]  We go in. I fix my glasses.
[06:07.730 --> 06:10.030]  I'm not injured too badly.
[06:10.030 --> 06:12.030]  Had some bruises.
[06:12.030 --> 06:13.930]  We go in. We party.
[06:13.930 --> 06:16.330]  We come back out.
[06:16.330 --> 06:18.930]  The party, somebody goes,
[06:18.930 --> 06:24.130]  Oh my God, Gail, there's your face on the window.
[06:24.130 --> 06:30.130]  I hit that plate glass window so hard that I left my entire face.
[06:30.130 --> 06:31.830]  Your whole face.
[06:31.830 --> 06:34.630]  Lips and nose.
[06:34.630 --> 06:35.630]  Like a pillow in the morning.
[06:35.630 --> 06:38.030]  It was hilarious.
[06:38.030 --> 06:39.330]  You want to hear about my second injury?
[06:39.330 --> 06:40.730]  Are you okay from the first one?
[06:40.930 --> 06:42.930]  So, lasting damage from the first one.
[06:42.930 --> 06:44.830]  Just pride or stitches?
[06:44.830 --> 06:45.630]  No, nothing.
[06:45.630 --> 06:48.330]  Thank God that window didn't break.
[06:48.330 --> 06:52.630]  But you actually heard thump, because I was running so fast.
[06:52.630 --> 06:55.230]  That was your pride hitting the window.
[06:55.230 --> 06:57.530]  I bounced probably two feet back off that window.
[06:57.530 --> 07:00.230]  That's how hard I hit it.
[07:00.230 --> 07:02.030]  In Michigan.
[07:02.030 --> 07:04.330]  I'm visualizing it over my head.
[07:04.330 --> 07:09.330]  We go to D.C. last weekend, a week after my Michigan injuries.
[07:09.330 --> 07:12.830]  Kevin and I decide to go exploring.
[07:12.830 --> 07:13.530]  No problem, right?
[07:13.530 --> 07:14.130]  Fair enough.
[07:14.130 --> 07:15.830]  Navigation, what's your phone?
[07:15.830 --> 07:17.230]  We got GPS, we're good.
[07:17.230 --> 07:19.430]  She just calculated a bunch of numbers on your phone.
[07:19.430 --> 07:21.530]  Forgot to check the battery life of the phone.
[07:21.530 --> 07:23.430]  We're 20 minutes into the walk.
[07:23.430 --> 07:25.130]  Have no idea where we're at.
[07:25.130 --> 07:27.730]  And I have 1% battery power.
[07:27.730 --> 07:30.030]  I said, Oh, Kevin, we're fucked.
[07:30.030 --> 07:31.430]  I don't know where we're at.
[07:31.430 --> 07:32.330]  He goes, Hurry up.
[07:32.330 --> 07:35.030]  Find long-term on your phone where we got to go.
[07:35.030 --> 07:38.830]  I'm looking at my phone, not at my feet.
[07:38.830 --> 07:43.030]  There is a big tree thing that grew up into the sidewalk.
[07:43.030 --> 07:48.430]  I literally bounced my lip up the asphalt.
[07:48.430 --> 07:51.930]  Again, my glasses went flying.
[07:51.930 --> 07:53.130]  And this time I injured my hand.
[07:53.130 --> 07:53.630]  I see that.
[07:53.630 --> 07:54.130]  Boo-boos on your hand.
[07:54.130 --> 07:55.830]  I've been seeing them on Instagram Live.
[07:55.830 --> 07:57.730]  This one, I kind of sprained my hand.
[07:57.730 --> 08:01.430]  But I knew it was bad because Kevin come running and he said,
[08:01.430 --> 08:02.430]  Are you okay?
[08:02.430 --> 08:03.230]  I said, I am.
[08:03.230 --> 08:05.530]  And then he said, Well, you should have been watching your feet.
[08:05.630 --> 08:07.630]  I'm trying to figure out where the hell we're at.
[08:10.330 --> 08:11.930]  We're staying in the Airbnb.
[08:11.930 --> 08:14.430]  This is a really great story.
[08:14.430 --> 08:15.630]  Should I tell the great story?
[08:15.630 --> 08:15.930]  Yeah.
[08:15.930 --> 08:16.130]  Yeah.
[08:16.130 --> 08:16.930]  It's a great story.
[08:16.930 --> 08:17.530]  We want to hear it.
[08:17.530 --> 08:19.530]  All of my injuries, something really good came.
[08:19.530 --> 08:21.430]  We are lost as can be.
[08:21.430 --> 08:22.430]  Talking to the top of the mic.
[08:22.430 --> 08:22.930]  There you go.
[08:22.930 --> 08:24.130]  We are lost as can be.
[08:25.730 --> 08:28.230]  And I don't know how we're going to get back to the Airbnb.
[08:28.230 --> 08:29.030]  Phone's dead.
[08:29.030 --> 08:32.930]  And I'm looking around and I'm not getting a vibe that I can ask you,
[08:32.930 --> 08:34.830]  How do I get back to my place?
[08:35.130 --> 08:39.630]  Finally, I see a young urban professional, probably early 30s with
[08:39.630 --> 08:40.530]  a baby on his back.
[08:40.530 --> 08:45.130]  And I say, I hate to bother you, but I am so lost.
[08:45.130 --> 08:46.030]  Can you help me?
[08:46.030 --> 08:51.130]  And he says, I will walk you as far as my brownstone and then I'll
[08:51.130 --> 08:52.430]  tell you how to get from there.
[08:52.430 --> 08:55.030]  Very nice young man.
[08:55.030 --> 08:56.530]  Five minutes into the walk.
[08:56.530 --> 08:59.630]  He goes, I can't help but notice your earrings.
[08:59.630 --> 09:01.630]  She's got pot leaf earrings, you guys.
[09:01.630 --> 09:03.630]  And I said, yeah.
[09:03.630 --> 09:07.230]  My guess is the earrings weren't the only cannabis related item of
[09:07.230 --> 09:08.730]  clothing you had on at the moment.
[09:08.730 --> 09:12.630]  I think probably the only thing you could really see.
[09:12.630 --> 09:16.930]  I had like a vest on because it was kind of chilly there in DC as
[09:16.930 --> 09:17.230]  well.
[09:17.230 --> 09:21.430]  There was no pot, nothing visible like I usually have on.
[09:21.430 --> 09:24.130]  Nothing glass or anything, but these were visible.
[09:24.130 --> 09:27.430]  And I said, yes, I'm a marijuana advocate.
[09:27.430 --> 09:33.030]  And he says, I don't like this whole legalization thing.
[09:33.030 --> 09:34.330]  I have a lot of questions.
[09:34.330 --> 09:37.330]  And I said, you got the perfect lady right here.
[09:37.330 --> 09:39.230]  And he was like, what do you mean?
[09:39.230 --> 09:43.130]  And I said, I'm kind of known for talking a lot of bullshit about
[09:43.130 --> 09:44.130]  marijuana.
[09:44.130 --> 09:47.030]  So we get talking.
[09:47.030 --> 09:49.730]  I learned quite a bit about this young man.
[09:49.730 --> 09:53.730]  I learned his father is a cardiologist.
[09:53.730 --> 09:57.730]  His brother is a surgeon in one of the branches of the military.
[09:57.730 --> 10:00.830]  He is a financial planner.
[10:00.930 --> 10:03.230]  His wife is a CEO of a company.
[10:03.230 --> 10:07.730]  And they're not, they're frightened about cannabis.
[10:07.730 --> 10:09.730]  The cartels are going to come in.
[10:09.730 --> 10:14.330]  And everything stereotypical is what he is frightened about.
[10:14.330 --> 10:19.230]  We get to his brownstone and he's asked me questions about how I feel
[10:19.230 --> 10:20.330]  about legalization.
[10:20.330 --> 10:24.130]  And I say, for a family like yourself, legalization is the way to go.
[10:24.130 --> 10:26.630]  In Colorado, it's track, sea to sail.
[10:26.630 --> 10:28.930]  There's no funny business going on.
[10:29.030 --> 10:34.030]  We got to his brownstone and he says, I'm enjoying our conversation so much.
[10:34.030 --> 10:36.230]  I'm going to walk you to your Airbnb.
[10:36.230 --> 10:37.430]  I flipped him.
[10:37.430 --> 10:38.630]  I did flip him.
[10:38.630 --> 10:39.230]  That's awesome.
[10:39.230 --> 10:43.030]  By the time we got to the Airbnb, he was convinced.
[10:43.030 --> 10:44.530]  I told him Kevin's story.
[10:44.530 --> 10:45.130]  I told him.
[10:45.130 --> 10:48.630]  I said, you know, I really like you.
[10:48.630 --> 10:50.630]  I'm not going to say his name, although I did know it.
[10:50.630 --> 10:56.730]  I said, what makes Kevin and I sitting down and smoking a joint or me doing
[10:56.730 --> 10:57.030]  a dab?
[10:57.130 --> 11:01.030]  What makes that any different than you and your wife consuming a glass of
[11:01.030 --> 11:03.030]  wine when your children are in bed?
[11:03.030 --> 11:04.530]  I said, I bet you do that, don't you?
[11:04.530 --> 11:07.930]  And he said, I never thought about it that way.
[11:07.930 --> 11:09.430]  And most people don't.
[11:09.430 --> 11:14.730]  So he told me he's not so frightened now about legalization.
[11:14.730 --> 11:18.130]  And that maybe controlled marijuana is the way to go.
[11:18.130 --> 11:18.330]  Good.
[11:18.330 --> 11:19.730]  He brought him to the green side.
[11:19.730 --> 11:23.330]  Do you think he's going to go talk to his parents who are well-educated and
[11:23.330 --> 11:24.830]  teach them about cannabis also?
[11:24.830 --> 11:26.430]  He's going to go a step farther.
[11:26.430 --> 11:30.330]  He said he would talk to people in the financial institutions around there to
[11:30.330 --> 11:35.730]  see what is the reason we can't work with reputable cannabis companies.
[11:35.730 --> 11:36.330]  That's awesome.
[11:36.330 --> 11:40.430]  Now Kevin says, Gail, you know, as much as a goofball as I am, and you all know
[11:40.430 --> 11:46.430]  I am a goofball, when I need to be, I can be articulate and I can be personable.
[11:46.430 --> 11:49.930]  And I think maybe that was my whole mission there.
[11:49.930 --> 11:51.930]  Just that one interaction.
[11:51.930 --> 11:52.930]  That one interaction.
[11:52.930 --> 11:54.430]  Sometimes we're sent places just to be that angel.
[11:54.430 --> 11:57.430]  Because I knew the next day would all be a bunch of people like us.
[11:57.430 --> 11:58.930]  Everybody medicated.
[11:58.930 --> 12:01.230]  My word wasn't going to mean anything there.
[12:01.230 --> 12:03.630]  Maybe you're changing cannabis there right now.
[12:03.630 --> 12:05.030]  Maybe he's putting something into action.
[12:05.030 --> 12:08.830]  They're getting a bank going and they won't have the struggles that we have here in Colorado.
[12:08.830 --> 12:10.430]  I would love that.
[12:10.430 --> 12:12.630]  Your little angel moment that you provided there.
[12:12.630 --> 12:16.430]  So that was like, that was my big moment from WDC.
[12:16.430 --> 12:21.930]  Well, I'm sorry that you hurt yourself, but I'm glad you were able to spread some knowledge and turn some people on to our side.
[12:21.930 --> 12:22.930]  Yes.
[12:22.930 --> 12:24.030]  Well, thank you for doing that.
[12:24.030 --> 12:26.530]  Do you want to keep going with stories or do you want to...
[12:26.530 --> 12:27.530]  I don't know.
[12:27.530 --> 12:29.530]  Let me ask Mike.
[12:29.530 --> 12:33.030]  Mike here, he knows a lot about the laws.
[12:33.030 --> 12:37.530]  That is what I would say your biggest part of the industry is.
[12:37.530 --> 12:43.530]  That's the part of the industry that I have locked down more than anyone else I know.
[12:43.530 --> 12:45.030]  That's why we call him White Mike.
[12:45.030 --> 12:45.530]  Right.
[12:45.530 --> 12:47.030]  He's the guy that follows the rules.
[12:47.030 --> 12:49.530]  And he does follow the rules and he knows what the rules are.
[12:49.530 --> 12:50.530]  I try.
[12:50.530 --> 12:55.030]  When I'm trying to do something, when I'm getting a little too out of hand, I'm trying to break three rules at once.
[12:55.030 --> 12:57.030]  Mike will say, break one law at a time, bro.
[12:57.030 --> 12:58.030]  One law at a time.
[12:58.030 --> 12:59.030]  I said that this morning.
[12:59.030 --> 13:04.030]  Literally the best advice I've ever been given is if you're going to break a rule or a law, break one rule or law at a time.
[13:04.030 --> 13:14.030]  This morning when young kids were asking me about, you know, the weekend and doing this or that, I was like, the best advice I can give you is do one illegal thing, one stupid thing at a time.
[13:14.030 --> 13:16.030]  Don't be doing all kinds of dumb shit at once.
[13:16.030 --> 13:17.030]  You're going to get in trouble.
[13:17.030 --> 13:20.530]  It's when you start comboing shit up that all the shenanigans really get out of hand.
[13:20.530 --> 13:22.530]  And everybody needs a friend like Mike around.
[13:22.530 --> 13:26.530]  Sometimes you got to have a guy to pull the reins and go, hey, you're going fucking crazy.
[13:26.530 --> 13:28.530]  You just need a guy to remind you that you're slipping up a little bit.
[13:28.530 --> 13:30.530]  Especially some of us that are very impulsive.
[13:30.530 --> 13:32.530]  We don't think long term.
[13:32.530 --> 13:34.530]  I know I am.
[13:34.530 --> 13:38.530]  So one of my concerns is people say that I do a lot of boneheaded things.
[13:39.030 --> 13:50.030]  And one of them, they think I'm terrible for being so transparent, traveling from state, legal state to legal state with, as I say, my medicine.
[13:52.030 --> 13:55.030]  It's a real, real gray area.
[13:55.030 --> 14:08.030]  And basically, you're putting yourself at the mercy of every law enforcement agency whose jurisdiction you happen to travel through on the ground.
[14:08.530 --> 14:20.530]  And so just because the TSA in Denver doesn't give a shit, doesn't mean that a stewardess won't radio ahead and have the local PD for wherever you're landing ruin your trip.
[14:20.530 --> 14:23.530]  Okay. That's a good bit of advice there.
[14:23.530 --> 14:36.530]  When it's from legal state to legal state or medical state to medical state, you're lowering your odds of having a shitty trip when you land and having law enforcement waiting to ruin your day.
[14:37.030 --> 14:43.030]  But right now, as far as I can recall, there's only one state with what they call reciprocity.
[14:43.030 --> 14:49.030]  Meaning they consider your state's medical marijuana card is valid, and that's Nevada.
[14:49.030 --> 14:58.030]  But they don't say explicitly that it's kosher to fly into Nevada with a product you picked up in another legal state.
[14:58.030 --> 15:05.030]  So it's an incredibly gray, very close to the illegal side of the line.
[15:05.530 --> 15:09.530]  If you get technical, you are transporting narcotics.
[15:09.530 --> 15:10.530]  Across state lines.
[15:10.530 --> 15:12.530]  Aerospace is federal. Federal aerospace.
[15:12.530 --> 15:16.530]  The feds don't care unless it's enough to distribute them.
[15:16.530 --> 15:20.530]  That seems to be more of the issue.
[15:20.530 --> 15:26.530]  TSA will tell me their mission is more bombs and things that are going to hurt other passengers.
[15:26.530 --> 15:29.530]  If you can't hurt somebody with it right now, TSA doesn't have time to care.
[15:30.030 --> 15:38.030]  Metro in Vegas, because I've pushed it to the limits, they told me what I bring is nothing.
[15:38.030 --> 15:39.030]  Leave me alone.
[15:39.030 --> 15:43.030]  They are looking for people that are transporting large amounts.
[15:43.030 --> 15:44.030]  Trafficking.
[15:44.030 --> 15:45.030]  Trafficking.
[15:45.030 --> 15:54.030]  There's one business right now in Alaska, their production facility in one of their shops are like what we would consider half the country away.
[15:54.030 --> 15:56.030]  Because it's in Alaska and one side of the state.
[15:56.030 --> 15:58.030]  It can be days travel from the other side.
[15:58.530 --> 16:00.530]  They are flying product back and forth right now.
[16:00.530 --> 16:03.530]  It's a major news story that comes up every two months.
[16:03.530 --> 16:07.530]  Another news outlet will hear about it and go, holy shit, they are putting weed on a plane.
[16:07.530 --> 16:13.530]  In Alaska, those little jumper planes are like driving a bus from Springs to Denver.
[16:13.530 --> 16:17.530]  It's such a rural place and it's so far apart that it's normal for them.
[16:17.530 --> 16:22.530]  They drive to the plane, they get on the plane, they drive to the other landing, they get in the other truck and drive back to their spot.
[16:22.530 --> 16:23.530]  It's just what they do in Alaska.
[16:24.030 --> 16:32.030]  Don't you think as advocates or activists, sometimes we do have to push things in those gray areas?
[16:32.030 --> 16:39.030]  Because I will say, why do I have to follow the rules when they are not even concrete all the time?
[16:39.030 --> 16:43.030]  That's where the change comes from and that's how we end up with actual rules.
[16:43.030 --> 16:48.030]  Like right now, you can take booze on a plane, I think, if you follow very specific rules.
[16:48.030 --> 16:49.030]  They will sell it to you there.
[16:49.030 --> 16:51.030]  But you can't open it on the plane.
[16:51.530 --> 16:54.530]  You have to follow very specific rules.
[16:54.530 --> 16:59.530]  If you are drunk at altitude, all sorts of crazy shit happens because there is not enough oxygen in your blood.
[16:59.530 --> 17:01.530]  Yeah, they will boot jump the plane.
[17:01.530 --> 17:04.530]  Yeah, they won't let you board if they think you are drunk.
[17:04.530 --> 17:09.530]  But so far we haven't had anybody freak out up in the air on cannabis.
[17:09.530 --> 17:11.530]  Please keep that streak going, people.
[17:11.530 --> 17:14.530]  As advocates or activists or whatever you would like to title us,
[17:14.530 --> 17:18.530]  is it our responsibility to follow the rules and play fair so we don't fuck it up?
[17:18.530 --> 17:22.030]  Or is it our responsibility to push the limits so that things change the way we need it?
[17:22.030 --> 17:23.030]  It's both.
[17:23.030 --> 17:24.030]  Okay.
[17:24.030 --> 17:27.030]  Is that why there is a white mic version of activism?
[17:27.030 --> 17:29.030]  The dab and granny version of activism?
[17:29.030 --> 17:31.030]  The revs version of activism which we can see here?
[17:31.030 --> 17:33.030]  It depends on each situation.
[17:33.030 --> 17:36.030]  So you need a person to address each situation that arises.
[17:36.030 --> 17:37.030]  I can respect that.
[17:37.030 --> 17:39.030]  It takes all kinds.
[17:39.030 --> 17:42.030]  Like when I first heard we were coming to a legit cannabis church, I was like,
[17:42.030 --> 17:44.030]  Jeff, where are you taking me?
[17:44.030 --> 17:46.030]  And I walked in and I was like, oh, he is taking me home.
[17:46.530 --> 17:49.530]  But it's not my type of activism.
[17:49.530 --> 17:52.530]  It's not something that I would wake up on Monday morning and say,
[17:52.530 --> 17:54.530]  today I'm going to found.
[17:55.530 --> 17:59.530]  And I have a feeling that the rev here would be substantially less comfortable
[17:59.530 --> 18:02.530]  than I am going in front of city council
[18:02.530 --> 18:06.530]  and lobbying for a specific zoning change or something of that nature.
[18:06.530 --> 18:07.530]  Probably normally.
[18:07.530 --> 18:09.530]  It's just a guess.
[18:09.530 --> 18:11.530]  But, well, yeah, I have legal schooling.
[18:11.530 --> 18:14.530]  I'm actually a law student on hiatus and stuff.
[18:15.030 --> 18:17.030]  I'm more or less the council for the church,
[18:17.030 --> 18:20.030]  so I have to deal with all our zoning and stuff.
[18:20.030 --> 18:22.030]  So you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[18:22.030 --> 18:25.030]  Half the time when I bring it up, people look at me like I'm talking gibberish
[18:25.030 --> 18:27.030]  or a language they've never heard before.
[18:27.030 --> 18:29.030]  No, I do consulting on the side.
[18:29.030 --> 18:31.030]  I help raise revenue for the church.
[18:31.030 --> 18:33.030]  I worked at a law office for like four years.
[18:33.030 --> 18:36.030]  So it saves me a lot of attorney fees for the church.
[18:36.030 --> 18:38.030]  Absolutely.
[18:38.030 --> 18:40.030]  That's how I found you was your Facebook posts.
[18:40.030 --> 18:43.030]  Everybody was like, if you're following cannabis activism, check out this guy.
[18:43.030 --> 18:45.530]  And I found you through your legal actions and Facebook posts.
[18:45.530 --> 18:47.530]  I used to post a lot of great things that would educate me,
[18:47.530 --> 18:49.530]  keep me on top of stuff.
[18:50.530 --> 18:53.530]  Being a religious guy, any time I get politically active,
[18:53.530 --> 18:56.530]  I have to run on the Republican ticket.
[18:57.530 --> 19:01.530]  But I actually did delegate all the way to the state level this year.
[19:01.530 --> 19:02.530]  Nice.
[19:02.530 --> 19:05.530]  Got a lot of them to flip their stance on cannabis
[19:05.530 --> 19:09.530]  because they're scared they don't have voters in Colorado.
[19:10.030 --> 19:15.030]  It's like third unaffiliated, third Democrat, 30%, Republican,
[19:15.030 --> 19:19.030]  30, 30, and then 10% third parties.
[19:19.030 --> 19:22.030]  But the only way to win is to flip done affiliated.
[19:22.030 --> 19:24.030]  And so I told the Republicans,
[19:24.030 --> 19:28.030]  the only way that's happening is to support our state rights for cannabis
[19:28.030 --> 19:31.030]  because you're Republican, you stand for state rights.
[19:32.030 --> 19:35.030]  What we're seeing nationally right now is a bunch of Republicans
[19:35.030 --> 19:37.030]  really standing up for cannabis,
[19:37.530 --> 19:39.530]  specifically as a states rights issue.
[19:39.530 --> 19:42.530]  I never thought I'd find myself agreeing with Cory Gardner on anything.
[19:42.530 --> 19:44.530]  It's amazing, isn't it?
[19:44.530 --> 19:47.530]  And all of a sudden I'm like, I'm kind of a Cory Gardner fan,
[19:47.530 --> 19:50.530]  and just saying that out loud might get me ostracized at holidays.
[19:51.530 --> 19:54.530]  He's really standing up for Colorado on a states rights issue
[19:54.530 --> 19:56.530]  and really went to battle for us.
[19:56.530 --> 19:57.530]  And that's what we need.
[19:57.530 --> 19:58.530]  It is.
[19:59.530 --> 20:01.530]  And we have to keep open-minded.
[20:01.530 --> 20:05.530]  Like you said, I never thought I would be agreeing with certain people either.
[20:06.030 --> 20:08.030]  But you're out there changing people's minds, Granny.
[20:08.030 --> 20:10.030]  You're the one out there doing the mind-changing.
[20:10.030 --> 20:11.030]  Well, that's just because I'm me.
[20:11.030 --> 20:13.030]  Planting those little seeds of mind-changing.
[20:13.030 --> 20:14.030]  I just like to talk.
[20:14.030 --> 20:15.030]  And watching them spread through the community.
[20:15.030 --> 20:18.030]  And I don't know how I fell into this, but I'm glad I did.
[20:18.030 --> 20:21.030]  You're so much easier to, you're not intimidating.
[20:21.030 --> 20:22.030]  You're non-threatening.
[20:22.030 --> 20:26.030]  People can listen to this beautiful older lady that's already got a life,
[20:26.030 --> 20:28.030]  that has nothing to prove, that's got nothing to,
[20:28.030 --> 20:29.030]  you're not trying to prove anything.
[20:29.030 --> 20:31.030]  But I like to have fun too.
[20:31.030 --> 20:32.030]  And that's the best part.
[20:32.030 --> 20:34.030]  You're having fun with cannabis while advocating it.
[20:34.530 --> 20:35.530]  And you've got a reason for it.
[20:35.530 --> 20:38.530]  He's not so grumpy, but dabbing Grandpa now.
[20:38.530 --> 20:39.530]  What are we calling him nowadays?
[20:39.530 --> 20:42.530]  They're calling him Kevin and he's having a really good time.
[20:42.530 --> 20:45.530]  Cool. Yeah, Kevin is enjoying life because of the cannabis.
[20:45.530 --> 20:47.530]  This time they said, are you her security?
[20:47.530 --> 20:48.530]  And he said, no, I'm her husband.
[20:48.530 --> 20:49.530]  Yeah, he is.
[20:49.530 --> 20:50.530]  Shout out, Kevin.
[20:50.530 --> 20:51.530]  I hope you get to listen to this.
[20:51.530 --> 20:52.530]  Come next time, dude.
[20:52.530 --> 20:53.530]  You can be on the show if you'd like.
[20:53.530 --> 20:54.530]  You're always invited.
[20:54.530 --> 20:55.530]  I'll bring him.
[20:55.530 --> 20:56.530]  Yeah, he can come.
[20:56.530 --> 20:59.530]  It's fun when we go hang out at events because a lot of times things get,
[20:59.530 --> 21:01.530]  people like to come say hi to you and I.
[21:02.030 --> 21:04.030]  Sometimes I just look over at Kevin and he just looks at me like, yeah,
[21:04.030 --> 21:05.030]  this is my life.
[21:05.030 --> 21:07.030]  Sometimes I'll sneak away and go hang out with him.
[21:07.030 --> 21:10.030]  Somebody made me cry in my live the other day.
[21:10.030 --> 21:14.030]  They said that in DC that I was mobbed,
[21:14.030 --> 21:18.030]  that people were taking my picture and that he was standing to the side.
[21:18.030 --> 21:22.030]  And somebody said to him, when did you know Gail was a rockstar?
[21:22.030 --> 21:24.030]  And he said, the day I married her.
[21:25.030 --> 21:26.030]  He's absolutely right.
[21:26.030 --> 21:28.030]  That just was like, wow.
[21:28.030 --> 21:30.030]  I knew the moment I met you, he gave me a big old hug.
[21:30.530 --> 21:31.530]  It was like we'd known each other forever.
[21:31.530 --> 21:32.530]  Yep.
[21:32.530 --> 21:34.530]  Yeah, we'd been talking on social media for so long.
[21:34.530 --> 21:36.530]  It was just like old friends that hadn't seen each other in a while.
[21:36.530 --> 21:39.530]  Hey Mike, what do you think these three states that I've been to,
[21:39.530 --> 21:42.530]  Michigan, California and DC,
[21:42.530 --> 21:45.530]  what do you think they're in store for with legalization?
[21:46.530 --> 21:48.530]  A long fight.
[21:49.530 --> 21:50.530]  They're all at different stages.
[21:50.530 --> 21:53.530]  None of them have quite obtained what Colorado has yet.
[21:53.530 --> 21:56.530]  They are still having, I call it the wild west.
[21:57.030 --> 22:01.030]  Michigan, I went to a dispensary.
[22:03.030 --> 22:09.030]  I walked in, the owner came out, strapped, smoking a blunt.
[22:09.030 --> 22:11.030]  And said, come on around.
[22:11.030 --> 22:12.030]  I remember those days.
[22:12.030 --> 22:14.030]  Old school Colorado.
[22:15.030 --> 22:18.030]  That's 2009 like a motherfucker right there.
[22:18.030 --> 22:21.030]  150 strains on the shelf.
[22:21.030 --> 22:23.030]  None of them grown in his dispensary.
[22:23.030 --> 22:24.030]  Not one, huh?
[22:24.030 --> 22:25.030]  Not one.
[22:25.530 --> 22:27.530]  Just buy it and flip it as fast as they can, huh?
[22:27.530 --> 22:29.530]  And no edibles.
[22:29.530 --> 22:30.530]  Colorado nowadays.
[22:30.530 --> 22:32.530]  100 plus or minus.
[22:33.530 --> 22:35.530]  100 milligrams plus or minus on the edibles?
[22:35.530 --> 22:37.530]  That's what it says, plus or minus.
[22:37.530 --> 22:39.530]  So you might be getting 50.
[22:39.530 --> 22:41.530]  You might be getting 175.
[22:41.530 --> 22:45.530]  Every state's got to build their own lab testing infrastructure and that takes a while.
[22:45.530 --> 22:47.530]  DC doesn't have an industry.
[22:47.530 --> 22:51.530]  Everything I found in DC was products from out of state.
[22:51.530 --> 22:53.530]  It's all home production.
[22:54.030 --> 22:56.030]  It doesn't surprise me that there's a lot of out of state products.
[22:56.030 --> 22:58.030]  I guess they take it on the airplane like me.
[22:58.030 --> 23:00.030]  Most of that shit that goes out of state goes straight to the east coast.
[23:00.030 --> 23:02.030]  But they don't allow growing in DC, right?
[23:02.030 --> 23:06.030]  You can grow it but you can't buy it but you can possess it.
[23:06.030 --> 23:09.030]  It's kind of like Wyoming where you have to go out of state to get it.
[23:09.030 --> 23:10.030]  That's funny.
[23:10.030 --> 23:11.030]  You can't grow it.
[23:11.030 --> 23:13.030]  You can't grow it but you're allowed to possess it.
[23:13.030 --> 23:20.030]  I don't know the rules in each state but I think the places where you're not allowed to buy it at a store and you're not allowed to cultivate but you can have it, I think that's completely silly.
[23:20.030 --> 23:22.030]  Right, because you can't sell it in DC.
[23:22.530 --> 23:24.530]  It's all trade and donate.
[23:24.530 --> 23:29.530]  But again, it was like a flea market at the National Cannabis Festival on the mall.
[23:29.530 --> 23:31.530]  They're going to want their tax rate really soon.
[23:31.530 --> 23:35.530]  Because with legalization comes taxation and regulation.
[23:35.530 --> 23:48.530]  Well, the DC, I want to say it's city council, is legally prevented from spending money to draft the rules for the legalization law that the voters passed.
[23:48.530 --> 23:50.530]  Is it because of the federal?
[23:51.030 --> 23:58.030]  No state employees working on marijuana stuff, kind of like how Wyoming was doing it with the CBD.
[23:58.030 --> 24:01.030]  The political rules in DC are very odd.
[24:01.030 --> 24:09.030]  They live in a tiny portion of the country that's not like the rest of the country and so some of the rules and some of the rights are a little bit different.
[24:09.530 --> 24:18.530]  But they're so close to like people from Maryland came, people from all these places outlying.
[24:18.530 --> 24:20.530]  They all came to buy their medicine there.
[24:20.530 --> 24:32.530]  It's weird being from, like I'm from Colorado and so to me to travel to another state, like that's something you need to plan and pack a lunch for and you've got to stop for gas a couple of times before you get it done.
[24:32.530 --> 24:34.530]  And there are foley parts of the country on the East Coast.
[24:34.530 --> 24:37.530]  Gail's looking at me like I just said I could fly.
[24:38.030 --> 24:40.030]  But that is just not right.
[24:40.030 --> 24:45.030]  Where these borders are tiny, it's like driving 10 blocks away, you're in another state.
[24:45.030 --> 24:48.030]  Yeah, but you should still have it available in your state.
[24:48.030 --> 24:50.030]  This is why it should be legal.
[24:50.030 --> 24:52.030]  Those invisible lines should make you.
[24:52.030 --> 24:56.030]  Yeah, and then you just change how you want it legal in each state, like alcohol.
[24:56.030 --> 25:03.030]  Yep, like there can be a Utah of pot where you have to join the bar as a member to come in and pay your monthly dues.
[25:03.030 --> 25:05.030]  It'll probably be Utah.
[25:05.530 --> 25:07.530]  Like the church.
[25:07.530 --> 25:11.530]  That's how we run the church is kind of how they run the bars and stuff in Utah.
[25:11.530 --> 25:13.530]  And it works.
[25:13.530 --> 25:15.530]  Yep, it works.
[25:15.530 --> 25:17.530]  There's no riffraff here because you run it properly.
[25:17.530 --> 25:19.530]  Oh, you get a much higher code of standard as far as patrons than any other church.
[25:19.530 --> 25:23.530]  I heard something today on the news that just amazes me and this is more government.
[25:23.530 --> 25:27.530]  They just released the first synthetic CBD.
[25:27.530 --> 25:29.530]  What?
[25:30.030 --> 25:34.030]  They just released the first synthetic CBD.
[25:34.030 --> 25:36.030]  Why?
[25:36.030 --> 25:40.030]  Why do we need a synthetic CBD?
[25:40.030 --> 25:42.030]  That's it.
[25:42.030 --> 25:44.030]  Because they can't grow the real.
[25:44.030 --> 25:46.030]  Pharmaceuticals.
[25:46.030 --> 25:50.030]  Half of it is it's way easier to synthesize than grow.
[25:50.030 --> 25:54.030]  To grow it you really need a Jeff and they don't want that.
[25:54.030 --> 25:56.030]  And an extractor.
[25:56.030 --> 25:58.030]  That's why the federal grow is so sad.
[25:58.530 --> 26:02.530]  But I'm worried that is what we have to keep fighting or it will come to that.
[26:02.530 --> 26:04.530]  It's literally every day we have to fight.
[26:04.530 --> 26:08.530]  That's what legalization is coming to and I'm like, damn we fought for this.
[26:08.530 --> 26:10.530]  It's what we wanted but look at the cost.
[26:10.530 --> 26:12.530]  It was one of my biggest frustrations in Colorado.
[26:12.530 --> 26:22.530]  It's like the last season of Weeds where they take the big old garden and it's just chopped up through a lab and put out in fields.
[26:22.530 --> 26:24.530]  What's coming?
[26:25.030 --> 26:29.030]  One of my biggest disappointments in the community in Colorado is we all took four years off.
[26:29.030 --> 26:34.030]  After legalization passed to celebrate and enjoy it and build an industry.
[26:34.030 --> 26:38.030]  And I remember feeling like we won.
[26:38.030 --> 26:40.030]  I remember laying off.
[26:40.030 --> 26:48.030]  And then I started seeing that they were going to get us through zoning and they were going to turn it back into exactly what we had before legalization.
[26:48.030 --> 26:52.030]  And start blocking us and fighting us out and rooting us out that way.
[26:52.530 --> 26:57.530]  And getting a vote for legalization, having that vote passed and that's the beginning.
[26:57.530 --> 26:59.530]  That's just the beginning.
[26:59.530 --> 27:01.530]  That's maybe the middle of the beginning.
[27:01.530 --> 27:05.530]  You haven't reached the middle yet or even come close to the end.
[27:05.530 --> 27:09.530]  The fight is long and we all have to gear up for it and keep it going.
[27:09.530 --> 27:13.530]  I've been seeing where Californians want to repeal 64.
[27:13.530 --> 27:15.530]  Is that an option?
[27:15.530 --> 27:17.530]  I don't think so.
[27:18.030 --> 27:27.030]  It would be crazy hard to do but a lot of the people in the black market or the gray market have a vested interest against legalization.
[27:27.030 --> 27:29.030]  Of course.
[27:29.030 --> 27:33.030]  As soon as legalization shows up, the people that have been doing it for 25 years in the mountains are out.
[27:33.030 --> 27:35.030]  That's what happened here.
[27:35.030 --> 27:37.030]  Unless they can convert.
[27:37.030 --> 27:39.030]  And honestly, how many people couldn't convert here?
[27:39.530 --> 27:46.530]  I feel like everybody that could grow, that had heart for a grow, they got pushed out.
[27:46.530 --> 27:48.530]  And all the people that had a bunch of money, they took over.
[27:48.530 --> 27:52.530]  And now they're hiring people that have heart to grow and not paying them worth a shit.
[27:52.530 --> 27:54.530]  And they're kind of ruining the industry.
[27:54.530 --> 27:56.530]  Everything is subpar product.
[27:56.530 --> 28:00.530]  Products are subpar because owners are from corporations and they just want returns.
[28:00.530 --> 28:02.530]  They don't care about quality product.
[28:02.530 --> 28:04.530]  And then they hire a guy like me.
[28:04.530 --> 28:06.530]  I'm just being hypothetical.
[28:07.030 --> 28:11.030]  And then they don't give you the resources and they restrain you and restrict you.
[28:11.030 --> 28:13.030]  And that's what this industry does.
[28:13.030 --> 28:19.030]  I've consulted for a couple of businesses now for years that their problem is they will not invest in talent.
[28:19.030 --> 28:27.030]  They keep hiring their brother-in-law or their cousin or a guy that came in and said he was a master grower and was down for 13 an hour.
[28:31.030 --> 28:35.030]  Talent is what produces high quality products.
[28:35.530 --> 28:37.530]  Talent, skill, and support.
[28:37.530 --> 28:41.530]  And if you don't have all three of those going in your business, you can't produce a quality product.
[28:43.530 --> 28:49.530]  When I first came into this scene, I really did believe it was patients over profit.
[28:49.530 --> 28:51.530]  I really did believe that.
[28:51.530 --> 28:53.530]  I thought, oh yeah, we're doing a great thing.
[28:53.530 --> 28:56.530]  It is not that. It is not that anymore.
[28:56.530 --> 28:58.530]  It is profit over anything.
[28:58.530 --> 29:02.530]  Patients aren't going to be a thing here in Colorado in a few years.
[29:02.530 --> 29:04.530]  The patient model is disappearing.
[29:05.030 --> 29:09.030]  I was really sucked out of this industry when it became recreationally legal.
[29:09.030 --> 29:11.030]  I feel like that's when the soul got ripped out of it.
[29:11.030 --> 29:19.030]  One of the first things the state and local governments did was raise the bar of entry into the industry.
[29:19.030 --> 29:25.030]  First they said no felonies, and then okay, no felonies for five years, no drug felonies for ten.
[29:25.030 --> 29:34.030]  And so with every whack they could take, they made it harder and harder and harder for people in the industry before legalization to participate in the industry after.
[29:34.530 --> 29:44.530]  And the hurdle that really fixed it was saying, all right, like in Aurora, you need $400,000 just in a duffel bag in a safe in the back of your store to apply for a license.
[29:45.530 --> 29:51.530]  You need to have 400 cash liquid on hand in case you get sued or in case taxes come up.
[29:51.530 --> 29:53.530]  They wanted you to have that on hand.
[29:53.530 --> 29:54.530]  Just to get back that money.
[29:54.530 --> 29:55.530]  That's just pocket change.
[29:55.530 --> 30:02.530]  Pueblo tried to bring it up, and when they added it to their list of rules, their reasoning for doing so was, well, Aurora does it.
[30:03.030 --> 30:07.030]  And when I pointed out to city council that we're not allowed to use banks.
[30:07.030 --> 30:14.030]  When we invest money in this industry, it has to come from a bank account in Colorado, from money generated in Colorado.
[30:14.030 --> 30:18.030]  We have to withdraw that as cash, and then we can invest it in the business.
[30:18.030 --> 30:23.030]  Requiring us to have 400 grand, and then they lowered, well, maybe we'll only do 200 here.
[30:23.030 --> 30:30.030]  I was like, even 200 grand, you're requiring me to put 200 grand in a duffel bag and just keep that in the bottom of the gun safe in the back of my store.
[30:30.030 --> 30:32.030]  Think about what you're doing, just a little bit.
[30:32.530 --> 30:35.530]  They immediately pulled that rag once they realized what it meant.
[30:35.530 --> 30:45.530]  But before I really grabbed them by the throat and dragged them to reality, all of them thought it was a great idea.
[30:45.530 --> 30:55.530]  Because if we want responsible business owners to be the only people running these businesses, a responsible business owner should have a lot of money on hand, just cash.
[30:55.530 --> 30:57.530]  It's insane.
[30:57.530 --> 30:59.530]  That just makes you sound like a drug dealer.
[30:59.530 --> 31:01.530]  It sounds like a wildly irresponsible business owner.
[31:02.030 --> 31:04.030]  And they did it because somebody else did it.
[31:04.030 --> 31:06.030]  Yeah, because somebody else did it.
[31:06.030 --> 31:10.030]  It's the same reason we have five nanograms as the limit for your blood draw in Colorado.
[31:10.030 --> 31:14.030]  Five nanograms was what they had in some other state.
[31:14.030 --> 31:18.030]  And we were like, well, Georgia does it, and it's like, well, they just picked a fucking number.
[31:18.030 --> 31:20.030]  There's no science behind it, they don't do the research.
[31:20.030 --> 31:23.030]  Do you think they'll ever come up, they've got to be able to come up with something.
[31:23.030 --> 31:25.030]  They're not even allowed to do the research right now, Gail.
[31:27.030 --> 31:28.030]  That's how bad it is.
[31:28.530 --> 31:30.530]  I had this conversation.
[31:30.530 --> 31:38.530]  They could pull me over and I'm always going, I might not even have smoked or consumed at all that day, but my blood is going to say I'm high.
[31:38.530 --> 31:44.530]  Yes. I've been tested too, and I was way over five the next morning at like 1130.
[31:44.530 --> 31:50.530]  1400 or 14,000, whatever the test was, they could test for 1400 or 14,000 nanograms per particle or whatever.
[31:50.530 --> 31:53.530]  This doctor called me back and he's like, are you on a prescription for Marinol?
[31:53.530 --> 31:54.530]  And I was like, no.
[31:54.530 --> 31:55.530]  And he goes, how did you do this?
[31:55.530 --> 31:57.530]  Your blood, your urine is as high as we can test.
[31:57.530 --> 31:59.030]  I was like, I've been practicing for that test.
[31:59.030 --> 32:02.030]  You passed it.
[32:02.030 --> 32:04.030]  He's like, didn't you know you were going to get tested?
[32:04.030 --> 32:06.030]  I was like, nope, that shit was a surprise.
[32:06.030 --> 32:10.030]  People like us, when they say it takes 30 days to clean your system out for a drug test, for us it takes months.
[32:10.030 --> 32:15.030]  Yeah, I went 63 full days before I took a P-test and still failed that fucker.
[32:17.030 --> 32:19.030]  Josh said 72 days over there in the corner.
[32:19.030 --> 32:20.030]  I flush.
[32:20.030 --> 32:22.030]  I'll pass one tomorrow.
[32:22.030 --> 32:23.030]  Nice.
[32:23.530 --> 32:25.530]  I haven't taken one in 12 years.
[32:25.530 --> 32:26.530]  I couldn't even guess.
[32:26.530 --> 32:28.530]  Yeah, I'm going to do my best not to get into a situation.
[32:28.530 --> 32:29.530]  But what if they pulled you over?
[32:29.530 --> 32:38.530]  If they pulled me over right now, I mean, it's been a while since I've been pulled over, but you hit them with the evening officer, how can I help you this evening?
[32:38.530 --> 32:44.530]  And they start looking for a business card telling you have a good evening, usually before they even get to the window.
[32:44.530 --> 32:47.530]  As long as my car doesn't reek, I'm good to go.
[32:48.030 --> 32:51.030]  I'm trying to think. I don't think I've been pulled over.
[32:51.030 --> 32:55.030]  No, I've definitely been pulled over since I had my badge.
[32:57.030 --> 32:59.030]  It's been at least four years.
[32:59.030 --> 33:01.030]  I got pulled over and the cop could smell the herb.
[33:01.030 --> 33:07.030]  I rolled down the window, got my license, registration, proof of insurance in my hand, and the cop could smell the herb from 25 feet away from my car.
[33:07.030 --> 33:10.030]  And he just asked straight up, sir, do you have marijuana in there?
[33:10.030 --> 33:12.030]  And I was like, yeah.
[33:12.030 --> 33:14.030]  And I giggled, like, yes, sir, I do.
[33:14.030 --> 33:15.030]  It's my job.
[33:15.030 --> 33:16.030]  Do you have a lot?
[33:16.530 --> 33:19.530]  And I go, no, I just got my personal and I reached for my backpack and tapped it.
[33:19.530 --> 33:22.530]  I just got my personal bag in here and I go, oh, it like dawns on me.
[33:22.530 --> 33:25.530]  And I showed him I got my badge on my shoulder, on my chest here.
[33:25.530 --> 33:27.530]  And I was like, sorry, I work in a grow.
[33:27.530 --> 33:29.530]  I run a really big commercial grow.
[33:29.530 --> 33:30.530]  So I'm just rubbing up against it.
[33:30.530 --> 33:32.530]  And he goes, oh, my daughter's a trimmer.
[33:32.530 --> 33:34.530]  And he totally changed his whole tone.
[33:34.530 --> 33:36.530]  Yeah, he's like, smells pretty ripe in there.
[33:36.530 --> 33:38.530]  And he's like, I'm going to give you a warning because you were honest with me.
[33:38.530 --> 33:40.530]  You were going 92 in a 75.
[33:40.530 --> 33:41.530]  Let's slow it down.
[33:41.530 --> 33:42.530]  He's like, I see you got a new car.
[33:42.530 --> 33:44.530]  You're probably just seeing how fast it goes.
[33:45.030 --> 33:46.030]  Let's not go so fast today.
[33:46.030 --> 33:47.030]  And he let me go.
[33:47.030 --> 33:52.030]  Wouldn't you say that staying calm and being articulate goes a long way?
[33:52.030 --> 33:53.030]  Yes.
[33:53.030 --> 33:54.030]  Take off your sunglasses.
[33:54.030 --> 33:55.030]  Look them in the eye.
[33:55.030 --> 33:56.030]  Call them sir.
[33:56.030 --> 33:57.030]  Yes, sir.
[33:57.030 --> 33:58.030]  No, sir.
[33:58.030 --> 33:59.030]  You don't need to say a lot more.
[33:59.030 --> 34:04.030]  And if you're in a place where cannabis is legal and they ask you if you have cannabis, don't fucking lie.
[34:04.030 --> 34:05.030]  It's legal.
[34:05.030 --> 34:06.030]  There's no reason to lie.
[34:06.030 --> 34:07.030]  Yeah.
[34:07.030 --> 34:08.030]  When I said yes, I do.
[34:08.030 --> 34:09.030]  It's surreal the first time you do it.
[34:09.030 --> 34:10.030]  Don't get me wrong.
[34:10.030 --> 34:11.030]  That was the first time I admitted.
[34:11.030 --> 34:12.030]  Yes, sir.
[34:12.030 --> 34:13.030]  I got weed in the car.
[34:13.530 --> 34:14.530]  He smiled at me like, I don't know.
[34:14.530 --> 34:15.530]  He knew.
[34:15.530 --> 34:17.530]  That was the first time you ever said yes to that question.
[34:17.530 --> 34:20.530]  His shoulders went down and so did mine at the same time.
[34:20.530 --> 34:21.530]  This is tense.
[34:21.530 --> 34:22.530]  Do you have weed?
[34:22.530 --> 34:23.530]  Yes, sir.
[34:23.530 --> 34:24.530]  He goes, it's okay.
[34:24.530 --> 34:26.530]  He patted me on the head basically.
[34:26.530 --> 34:27.530]  You can have your weed, sir.
[34:27.530 --> 34:28.530]  It's okay.
[34:28.530 --> 34:30.530]  And since I told him I had it, he didn't go through my car.
[34:30.530 --> 34:32.530]  He didn't give me a fucking sobriety test.
[34:32.530 --> 34:33.530]  He didn't fuck my dick.
[34:33.530 --> 34:34.530]  Yeah, worried about your weed?
[34:34.530 --> 34:35.530]  Yeah.
[34:35.530 --> 34:38.530]  I had a quarter bag of fucking Rude Boy OG is what I think I had because I remember where I was going.
[34:38.530 --> 34:39.530]  Yeah.
[34:39.530 --> 34:41.530]  And it just stunk up the whole fucking neighborhood.
[34:42.030 --> 34:45.030]  Yeah, if he thought you were intoxicated, he would have had you out on the car doing roadsides.
[34:45.030 --> 34:46.030]  Clearly, he didn't.
[34:46.030 --> 34:47.030]  It was 11 in the morning.
[34:47.030 --> 34:48.030]  Yep.
[34:48.030 --> 34:49.030]  No dabs at 11 on I-25.
[34:49.030 --> 34:54.030]  I forget the smell we take home from the grow until I'm changing my laundry from washer to dryer.
[34:54.030 --> 34:57.030]  And I flip that washer open and I go, fuck.
[34:57.030 --> 34:58.030]  Start it again.
[34:58.030 --> 35:05.030]  Until you go to the King Soopers or something to get some ingredients for dinner on the way home and everyone in there gives you a dirty look.
[35:05.030 --> 35:06.030]  Like, what the fuck, man?
[35:06.030 --> 35:07.030]  I wouldn't be giving you a dirty look.
[35:07.030 --> 35:08.030]  I'd be smiling at you.
[35:08.030 --> 35:09.030]  Yeah, you'd come flirt with me, wouldn't you, Granny?
[35:09.030 --> 35:10.030]  Yep.
[35:10.530 --> 35:12.530]  I was asked, we ordered dinner at a restaurant in Springs.
[35:12.530 --> 35:16.530]  And after we, it was a walk up and order and then you go sit and wait and eat your food at the table there.
[35:16.530 --> 35:17.530]  You seat yourself.
[35:17.530 --> 35:21.530]  After we ordered, the guy said, so we'll bring that outside to you.
[35:21.530 --> 35:23.530]  And we're like, no, bro, it's like snowing.
[35:23.530 --> 35:24.530]  We're going to eat inside.
[35:24.530 --> 35:26.530]  And he's like, no, not, you guys reek of marijuana.
[35:26.530 --> 35:27.530]  You must go outside.
[35:27.530 --> 35:29.530]  He wouldn't let you eat in the restaurant?
[35:29.530 --> 35:32.530]  No, so at that point, I turned around and asked him for my money back.
[35:32.530 --> 35:35.530]  I was like, if I can't eat in here, I don't want the food, dude.
[35:35.530 --> 35:36.530]  I'm out.
[35:36.530 --> 35:38.530]  Yeah, there's a restaurant here in this town.
[35:38.530 --> 35:39.530]  I'm not going to say their name.
[35:39.530 --> 35:41.530]  The deal was a chair and a sandwich.
[35:41.530 --> 35:43.030]  You cannot provide both amounts.
[35:43.030 --> 35:44.030]  I'll tell you how I played Diva moment.
[35:44.030 --> 35:48.030]  When you just said that, you made me get all smiley.
[35:48.030 --> 35:50.030]  I want to hear about your Diva moment.
[35:50.030 --> 35:56.030]  At that last festival, I wanted so badly to go up on stage with the group that was playing.
[35:57.030 --> 35:58.030]  Do we want to say the name?
[35:58.030 --> 35:59.030]  Because I know who they were.
[35:59.030 --> 36:01.030]  It was Cypress Hill and B-Real.
[36:01.030 --> 36:04.030]  I so wanted to go up there and meet them.
[36:04.030 --> 36:05.030]  I've wanted to for a long time.
[36:05.030 --> 36:06.030]  I'm going to take a dab while you tell this story.
[36:06.030 --> 36:07.030]  It's required.
[36:07.530 --> 36:10.530]  So, phone home, he said.
[36:10.530 --> 36:11.530]  Gail, I asked.
[36:11.530 --> 36:12.530]  They said no.
[36:12.530 --> 36:13.530]  I was like, oh, come on.
[36:13.530 --> 36:14.530]  We got all access.
[36:14.530 --> 36:15.530]  Let's try it.
[36:15.530 --> 36:17.530]  So, we go over.
[36:17.530 --> 36:19.530]  The security guy was so sweet.
[36:19.530 --> 36:21.530]  He goes, Granny, I can't.
[36:21.530 --> 36:23.530]  I can't let you up there.
[36:23.530 --> 36:26.530]  Chris Crazy goes, we're a tour manager.
[36:26.530 --> 36:27.530]  Bring him over.
[36:27.530 --> 36:29.530]  Brought him over.
[36:29.530 --> 36:32.530]  He goes, no, nobody can go up on stage.
[36:32.530 --> 36:35.530]  Chris Crazy goes, just dab them, Granny.
[36:36.030 --> 36:38.030]  Damn, you've got a million fans.
[36:38.030 --> 36:39.030]  You let her go up on stage.
[36:39.030 --> 36:40.030]  He was like, no.
[36:40.030 --> 36:42.030]  Nobody's going up on stage.
[36:42.030 --> 36:45.030]  So, I looked at them two and I was like, well, we tried.
[36:45.030 --> 36:47.030]  We start walking away.
[36:48.030 --> 36:50.030]  Chris goes, look, he's up there talking to them now.
[36:50.030 --> 36:52.030]  We keep walking away.
[36:52.030 --> 36:55.030]  The tour manager came running back and said,
[36:57.030 --> 37:00.030]  they said you can come and meet them after the set
[37:00.030 --> 37:01.030]  when they come off stage.
[37:01.030 --> 37:03.030]  I said, no.
[37:03.030 --> 37:05.030]  He said, excuse me.
[37:05.030 --> 37:08.030]  I said, no, you wouldn't let me go up on stage
[37:08.030 --> 37:10.030]  and have fun with the people.
[37:10.030 --> 37:12.030]  They sure as hell ain't getting a photo op with me.
[37:12.030 --> 37:13.030]  Thanks anyway.
[37:13.030 --> 37:14.030]  Bye.
[37:14.030 --> 37:16.030]  I like your style, Granny.
[37:16.030 --> 37:18.030]  I'm glad you know to call that a diva moment.
[37:18.030 --> 37:20.030]  That is a big diva moment.
[37:20.030 --> 37:23.030]  I think anybody else in this room would have stuck around
[37:23.030 --> 37:25.030]  for the photo op.
[37:25.030 --> 37:27.030]  Yeah, I would have stuck.
[37:27.030 --> 37:29.030]  Do you see where I was coming from?
[37:29.030 --> 37:30.030]  Yeah, they didn't want you the first time.
[37:30.030 --> 37:32.030]  Why did they want you the second time?
[37:32.030 --> 37:33.030]  I'm going to take this dab.
[37:33.030 --> 37:35.030]  I think that's something good to ramble about.
[37:35.030 --> 37:36.030]  Oh, what are you dabbing there?
[37:36.030 --> 37:38.030]  It's Charlie Sheen OG.
[37:38.030 --> 37:40.030]  It's supposed to be the HCFSE, but it's real mushy.
[37:40.030 --> 37:42.030]  It's monkey blood.
[37:42.030 --> 37:44.030]  It's got turps in it.
[37:44.030 --> 37:46.030]  And he's taking a hot dab as usual.
[37:46.030 --> 37:49.030]  If it's not red, it's not ready.
[37:49.030 --> 37:53.030]  So I hope someday, B-Rill, I meet you.
[37:55.030 --> 37:58.030]  I've been enjoying one of his new projects,
[37:58.030 --> 38:01.030]  but was never much a fan of the old.
[38:01.030 --> 38:02.030]  Just said that on the podcast.
[38:02.030 --> 38:04.030]  Send me a DM on PUNK15 on Twitter.
[38:04.030 --> 38:06.030]  There's some songs that I like, you know.
[38:06.030 --> 38:08.030]  Mike, there's no hatred.
[38:08.030 --> 38:09.030]  That's not your type of music.
[38:09.030 --> 38:11.030]  Nope, it's just outside of my range.
[38:11.030 --> 38:12.030]  Yeah, that's just not your thing.
[38:12.030 --> 38:14.030]  You are allowed to like and dislike music, I think.
[38:14.030 --> 38:16.030]  That's why there's so much of it.
[38:16.030 --> 38:17.030]  America.
[38:17.030 --> 38:18.030]  Hashtag America.
[38:18.030 --> 38:20.030]  Fuck yeah.
[38:20.030 --> 38:21.030]  If anybody would like a dab of that Charlie Sheen,
[38:21.030 --> 38:22.030]  I might recommend it.
[38:22.030 --> 38:24.030]  That was a...
[38:24.030 --> 38:25.030]  I'm roasted.
[38:25.030 --> 38:27.030]  I'm going to wait until a couple other people dab
[38:27.030 --> 38:28.030]  before I go again.
[38:28.030 --> 38:30.030]  All right, well, it's sitting there on the table.
[38:30.030 --> 38:32.030]  Granny's got the huge flame going on.
[38:32.030 --> 38:35.030]  Granny, can you teach us about insert dabs?
[38:35.030 --> 38:36.030]  Granny's going to do an insert dab.
[38:36.030 --> 38:37.030]  I will describe it.
[38:37.030 --> 38:38.030]  This freaks me out earlier.
[38:38.030 --> 38:40.030]  I had to ask questions.
[38:40.030 --> 38:42.030]  So...
[38:42.030 --> 38:43.030]  Well, I talk about dabs a lot on the show,
[38:43.030 --> 38:46.030]  and I try to keep people updated on what's going on.
[38:46.030 --> 38:48.030]  The new way that we're dabbing,
[38:48.030 --> 38:49.030]  so you use a banger.
[38:49.030 --> 38:52.030]  It looks a lot like the old banger, but it's bigger.
[38:52.030 --> 38:54.030]  It's much wider.
[38:54.030 --> 38:55.030]  So it is...
[38:55.030 --> 38:56.030]  Use a small...
[38:56.030 --> 38:59.030]  I like a small rig, a small bubbler.
[38:59.030 --> 39:01.030]  Then this piece fits where your bowl would go.
[39:01.030 --> 39:03.030]  It comes up at a 90-degree angle.
[39:03.030 --> 39:05.030]  Then it looks like it's got a giant glass thimble on it,
[39:05.030 --> 39:06.030]  to tell you the truth.
[39:06.030 --> 39:07.030]  And Granny's about to burn her arm with it.
[39:07.030 --> 39:08.030]  There we go.
[39:08.030 --> 39:10.030]  That was damn near a dab rant.
[39:10.030 --> 39:12.030]  Yeah, it's got a giant thimble.
[39:12.030 --> 39:15.030]  And then there is a smaller thimble.
[39:15.030 --> 39:17.030]  You take the smaller glass thimble,
[39:17.030 --> 39:18.030]  and you load it with your dab.
[39:18.030 --> 39:21.030]  Granny's putting a nice dab of this Charlie Sheen OG in there.
[39:21.030 --> 39:22.030]  And like a nice little insert.
[39:22.030 --> 39:25.030]  And then you drop that one piece of glass
[39:25.030 --> 39:26.030]  into the other piece of glass.
[39:26.030 --> 39:27.030]  Drop it while it's hot.
[39:27.030 --> 39:28.030]  Drop it like it's hot.
[39:28.030 --> 39:30.030]  So you got one piece of glass that you heat.
[39:30.030 --> 39:32.030]  Then you put your dab inside of another.
[39:32.030 --> 39:33.030]  You drop it in there.
[39:33.030 --> 39:34.030]  Then you put a carb cap on it.
[39:34.030 --> 39:36.030]  You want that bubble cap, I think.
[39:36.030 --> 39:37.030]  Yes, you need a bubble cap.
[39:37.030 --> 39:38.030]  You need it to get deep down in there.
[39:38.030 --> 39:39.030]  You need a nice bubble rotation motion.
[39:39.030 --> 39:40.030]  To move the air the way you need.
[39:40.030 --> 39:41.030]  To really spin those turps.
[39:41.030 --> 39:42.030]  Move that air.
[39:42.030 --> 39:43.030]  As soon as it starts bubbling,
[39:43.030 --> 39:45.030]  Granny starts dabbing it and smoking it.
[39:45.030 --> 39:46.030]  Now you're going to say,
[39:46.030 --> 39:48.030]  that sounds like a lot of fucking work.
[39:48.030 --> 39:49.030]  You're not wrong.
[39:49.030 --> 39:51.030]  At first, it's really turpy.
[39:51.030 --> 39:52.030]  Yeah.
[39:52.030 --> 39:54.030]  And well, it is a little extra work,
[39:54.030 --> 39:55.030]  but I like the ritual.
[39:55.030 --> 39:58.030]  It gives me one more step to participate in my dab smoking.
[39:58.030 --> 40:01.030]  Maybe it'll slow me down one little step.
[40:01.030 --> 40:03.030]  That's one of the things we have in common.
[40:03.030 --> 40:04.030]  We both enjoy the ritual a lot more
[40:04.030 --> 40:06.030]  than some of the other people I know.
[40:06.030 --> 40:07.030]  Yeah, it's just part of us.
[40:07.030 --> 40:08.030]  Sitting there and taking a dab and doing it.
[40:08.030 --> 40:09.030]  It just feels nice.
[40:09.030 --> 40:10.030]  And that one more thing is beautiful.
[40:10.030 --> 40:12.030]  That's why I don't like a knee nail.
[40:12.030 --> 40:13.030]  There's no ritual.
[40:13.030 --> 40:14.030]  All right.
[40:14.030 --> 40:15.030]  I can agree with that.
[40:15.030 --> 40:17.030]  But now the reason for the insert dab.
[40:17.030 --> 40:20.030]  It's so much easier to pull that little insert out of there
[40:20.030 --> 40:22.030]  and drop that into the cup of alcohol that she brought
[40:22.030 --> 40:24.030]  to clean it up.
[40:24.030 --> 40:25.030]  And then now it's fresh and clean.
[40:25.030 --> 40:28.030]  The scorched part of the dab didn't just burn the inside of her nail.
[40:28.030 --> 40:31.030]  My nail is black and funky and tastes like poop.
[40:31.030 --> 40:33.030]  Her dabs taste like turps and freshness every time.
[40:33.030 --> 40:35.030]  And they go on for a long...
[40:35.030 --> 40:39.030]  I did one the other night that was two minutes and 27 seconds.
[40:39.030 --> 40:42.030]  That's a long little jar of alcohol to go with it, though.
[40:42.030 --> 40:44.030]  It's not required because she's got multiple inserts
[40:44.030 --> 40:45.030]  and you could clean them off if you...
[40:45.030 --> 40:47.030]  Granny rolls in style.
[40:47.030 --> 40:50.030]  Granny is a spoiled hashbrat and I'm all about it.
[40:50.030 --> 40:51.030]  I'm very spoiled.
[40:51.030 --> 40:55.030]  And I thank the powers that be every day that I'm living this life.
[40:55.030 --> 40:57.030]  I do not take it for granted.
[40:57.030 --> 41:00.030]  We're smoking the best hash on the planet in a cannabis church
[41:00.030 --> 41:02.030]  in Colorado Springs with our best friends.
[41:02.030 --> 41:05.030]  If I could get a burger and a milkshake, I'd never leave.
[41:05.030 --> 41:07.030]  We're going to do that when we leave, so don't worry.
[41:07.030 --> 41:08.030]  I would never leave.
[41:11.030 --> 41:12.030]  The chairs are comfortable.
[41:12.030 --> 41:13.030]  The people are good.
[41:14.030 --> 41:15.030]  This is a good call, Granny.
[41:15.030 --> 41:17.030]  Thanks for putting this together.
[41:17.030 --> 41:18.030]  Insert dab, you guys.
[41:18.030 --> 41:19.030]  If you're trying to up your dab level,
[41:19.030 --> 41:21.030]  I was wondering how you're going to get that out of there.
[41:21.030 --> 41:22.030]  She brings little tweezers with you guys.
[41:22.030 --> 41:23.030]  She's got the whole kit.
[41:23.030 --> 41:24.030]  It's beautiful.
[41:24.030 --> 41:25.030]  The whole set up here.
[41:25.030 --> 41:26.030]  And they're not little tweezers.
[41:26.030 --> 41:28.030]  These look like...
[41:28.030 --> 41:31.030]  They're the size of a heavy-duty letter opener.
[41:32.030 --> 41:33.030]  Yes, yes.
[41:35.030 --> 41:36.030]  And she's got a jar of...
[41:36.030 --> 41:37.030]  Iso.
[41:37.030 --> 41:40.030]  It's Iso, but it's starting to look like cannabis moonshine at this point.
[41:40.030 --> 41:41.030]  Yep.
[41:41.030 --> 41:42.030]  I bet...
[41:42.030 --> 41:43.030]  It was clean when we started.
[41:43.030 --> 41:44.030]  It was clean when we started, she said.
[41:44.030 --> 41:45.030]  It's got an apple juice kind of color to it now.
[41:45.030 --> 41:47.030]  It does kind of look like a pea sample.
[41:47.030 --> 41:48.030]  It was crystal clear.
[41:48.030 --> 41:49.030]  It looked like water for a second.
[41:49.030 --> 41:51.030]  I thought it was shine when I first saw it.
[41:51.030 --> 41:54.030]  Then I realized quickly, that's a jar of alcohol.
[41:54.030 --> 41:56.030]  Granny's going to keep her shit clean.
[41:56.030 --> 41:58.030]  This has been an excellent podcast.
[41:58.030 --> 41:59.030]  This has been a good, fun time.
[42:01.030 --> 42:02.030]  If you want to grab that mic, brother,
[42:02.030 --> 42:04.030]  you could definitely jump on that one since the rep got busy.
[42:04.030 --> 42:07.030]  How come you're so smiley, Josh?
[42:08.030 --> 42:10.030]  He's enjoyed the conversation.
[42:10.030 --> 42:12.030]  He's watching the sausage get made.
[42:12.030 --> 42:14.030]  We are honored because we've got a winner.
[42:14.030 --> 42:16.030]  This guy is known as IROC Watts.
[42:16.030 --> 42:19.030]  He was a winner of the Adam Dunn Show Invitational one year.
[42:19.030 --> 42:20.030]  He's over there shaking his head no,
[42:20.030 --> 42:22.030]  but this kid grows fire-ass cannabis.
[42:22.030 --> 42:24.030]  He knows what he's doing.
[42:24.030 --> 42:25.030]  If you need some work done,
[42:25.030 --> 42:27.030]  this guy is not afraid to put in fucking work.
[42:27.030 --> 42:29.030]  He's one of those guys that puts in hours.
[42:29.030 --> 42:31.030]  He gets up before the sun and he goes to bed late at night.
[42:31.030 --> 42:34.030]  He's also an Instagram troll, so he's always putting in hours.
[42:34.030 --> 42:36.030]  He has a donkey.
[42:36.030 --> 42:37.030]  He's got a donkey?
[42:37.030 --> 42:38.030]  I thought you had an alpaca.
[42:38.030 --> 42:39.030]  He has a donkey.
[42:39.030 --> 42:41.030]  This show almost took a weird fucking turn.
[42:41.030 --> 42:42.030]  And chickens.
[42:43.030 --> 42:45.030]  Should we just title this one Donkey Show?
[42:45.030 --> 42:46.030]  Is that the name of this episode?
[42:46.030 --> 42:47.030]  No.
[42:47.030 --> 42:49.030]  I'm going to give the wrong impression.
[42:49.030 --> 42:53.030]  We can't have an insane sexual reference every time Granny's on the show.
[42:53.030 --> 42:55.030]  The last episode was about Boof and Hash if I remember correctly.
[42:55.030 --> 42:56.030]  Yes.
[42:56.030 --> 42:57.030]  We did put a lot of suppositories.
[42:57.030 --> 42:59.030]  I had to use one of them suppositories today.
[43:00.030 --> 43:01.030]  Are you okay?
[43:02.030 --> 43:05.030]  I probably hurt myself somehow some way and forgot how I did it.
[43:07.030 --> 43:08.030]  I'm not kidding.
[43:08.030 --> 43:10.030]  We need to get you a security guard and like a medic.
[43:10.030 --> 43:13.030]  After I did this fall that same night,
[43:13.030 --> 43:15.030]  we were in that Airbnb and it was on the third floor.
[43:15.030 --> 43:18.030]  If you've ever been to D.C., those brownstones are very high.
[43:19.030 --> 43:21.030]  And the railing only came to my knee.
[43:22.030 --> 43:23.030]  Well, Kevin said, order Grubhub.
[43:23.030 --> 43:27.030]  So I ordered us dinner, but he had to go to the gate to meet him.
[43:27.030 --> 43:30.030]  So he texted me, I'm here, and I said, I'll go get it.
[43:30.030 --> 43:31.030]  And Kevin said, no.
[43:31.030 --> 43:34.030]  If anybody could fall off this thing and hurt themselves,
[43:34.030 --> 43:37.030]  it's nighttime, I'll go get the food.
[43:37.030 --> 43:38.030]  Kevin, thank you.
[43:38.030 --> 43:39.030]  Noses lady.
[43:39.030 --> 43:40.030]  Noses lady.
[43:40.030 --> 43:42.030]  That's a couple that just came in.
[43:42.030 --> 43:44.030]  That's a couple that should stay together.
[43:44.030 --> 43:45.030]  That's some shit my wife would say.
[43:45.030 --> 43:47.030]  We take care of one another.
[43:47.030 --> 43:49.030]  I want the Chinese food to make it into the house.
[43:49.030 --> 43:50.030]  Stay the fuck on the couch.
[43:52.030 --> 43:55.030]  Yeah, I want the french fries to survive the drive.
[43:55.030 --> 43:56.030]  Yeah, the fries never make it home.
[43:56.030 --> 43:58.030]  We've been together 45 years.
[43:58.030 --> 43:59.030]  Well, he should be on the show next time.
[43:59.030 --> 44:01.030]  I want to hear some of those stories.
[44:01.030 --> 44:03.030]  I want to hear about some of that.
[44:03.030 --> 44:05.030]  Oh, he told one.
[44:05.030 --> 44:08.030]  He told about me dancing on tables.
[44:08.030 --> 44:11.030]  Kevin doesn't tell a lot of stories, but he told one.
[44:11.030 --> 44:14.030]  I didn't write down the word twerk because I was trying to dodge it.
[44:14.030 --> 44:17.030]  But would you like to tell us about your twerk adventure, Miss Granny?
[44:18.030 --> 44:20.030]  Don't ever give me Hennessy.
[44:21.030 --> 44:25.030]  I like stories that start with a stern look.
[44:25.030 --> 44:27.030]  So the key to the lock is Hennessy.
[44:27.030 --> 44:28.030]  A stern look.
[44:28.030 --> 44:30.030]  She's never given me a look that serious before.
[44:30.030 --> 44:32.030]  Don't ever give me Hennessy.
[44:32.030 --> 44:35.030]  Phone homie said, will you do your party trick on my,
[44:35.030 --> 44:41.030]  it's called the Slab Hour on WLSV radio.
[44:41.030 --> 44:43.030]  And I said, sure.
[44:43.030 --> 44:45.030]  I didn't know he was giving me Hennessy.
[44:46.030 --> 44:50.030]  And I got drunk on the Slab Hour.
[44:50.030 --> 44:54.030]  And they had a rapper up there and I jumped up on stage and
[44:54.030 --> 44:58.030]  I didn't know it, but I seen the video and I'm twerking.
[45:00.030 --> 45:02.030]  I rapped it to the floor.
[45:02.030 --> 45:03.030]  It's always worse when you see it for the first time on video.
[45:03.030 --> 45:05.030]  I want to see that video.
[45:05.030 --> 45:06.030]  It's on YouTube.
[45:06.030 --> 45:08.030]  I'm going to find that video.
[45:08.030 --> 45:10.030]  Project for the night.
[45:10.030 --> 45:12.030]  Were you doing the Granny's Party Trick?
[45:12.030 --> 45:13.030]  I did the party trick.
[45:13.030 --> 45:14.030]  The traditional?
[45:14.030 --> 45:15.030]  I did the party trick.
[45:15.030 --> 45:16.030]  The traditional.
[45:16.030 --> 45:20.030]  I try to describe the party trick, but I don't know if I get the steps in the correct order.
[45:20.030 --> 45:21.030]  Will you teach us about?
[45:21.030 --> 45:22.030]  I will.
[45:22.030 --> 45:26.030]  So they didn't have a bong, so I had to take a hit out of a spoon bowl.
[45:26.030 --> 45:27.030]  But normally it would be a bong.
[45:27.030 --> 45:28.030]  It would be a bong.
[45:28.030 --> 45:29.030]  I'd do a bong rip.
[45:29.030 --> 45:32.030]  And then I threw back that shot of Hennessy.
[45:32.030 --> 45:33.030]  And what would your normal shot be?
[45:33.030 --> 45:36.030]  She's still holding the pipe rip.
[45:36.030 --> 45:39.030]  Yeah, take a rip, hold it in, then do the shot.
[45:39.030 --> 45:41.030]  Yes, then I take the shot.
[45:41.030 --> 45:46.030]  Usually it'll be one of them fruity, they're kind of like wine cooler shots.
[45:46.030 --> 45:48.030]  That's what I equivalent to.
[45:48.030 --> 45:49.030]  I can't even talk.
[45:49.030 --> 45:51.030]  But they're fruity shots.
[45:51.030 --> 45:54.030]  They're called Porn Stars.
[45:54.030 --> 45:58.030]  And it's like raspberry vodka.
[45:58.030 --> 45:59.030]  It's not very strong.
[45:59.030 --> 46:01.030]  Did you just get in a strain?
[46:02.030 --> 46:09.030]  So then I take the shot, then I do a dab, and then I chug a beer.
[46:09.030 --> 46:10.030]  A pint of beer.
[46:10.030 --> 46:12.030]  And then I exhale.
[46:12.030 --> 46:19.030]  So I did that on Rico's show, but then I went back and did another dab,
[46:19.030 --> 46:22.030]  and then I just drank out of the Hennessy.
[46:22.030 --> 46:23.030]  That's where things go.
[46:23.030 --> 46:25.030]  I think it was that last step that got you.
[46:25.030 --> 46:26.030]  That part is what did it.
[46:26.030 --> 46:27.030]  That is what did it.
[46:27.030 --> 46:28.030]  Yeah.
[46:28.030 --> 46:31.030]  So can you tell me part of the story that you told earlier
[46:31.030 --> 46:34.030]  about what happened in that damn studio?
[46:34.030 --> 46:36.030]  About my friend losing control.
[46:36.030 --> 46:37.030]  Yes, please.
[46:37.030 --> 46:41.030]  This is a very, you know, it's a cannabis radio show,
[46:41.030 --> 46:46.030]  and Chris Crazy and I, we just lost control.
[46:46.030 --> 46:47.030]  We were crazy.
[46:47.030 --> 46:53.030]  We were just out of control doing crazy stuff.
[46:53.030 --> 46:55.030]  You didn't have a white mic with you.
[46:55.030 --> 46:58.030]  Well, my husband was out in the audience watching me.
[46:58.030 --> 47:01.030]  Thank God he loves me.
[47:01.030 --> 47:06.030]  The poor guy that's phone homey is the host of the radio show,
[47:06.030 --> 47:09.030]  stands up and says, Oh, my God, I just lost control.
[47:09.030 --> 47:11.030]  I lost control.
[47:11.030 --> 47:15.030]  And he poured a beer over his head, and Chris Crazy says, Oh, my God, Granny,
[47:15.030 --> 47:16.030]  that's a first.
[47:16.030 --> 47:18.030]  He has never lost it like that.
[47:18.030 --> 47:20.030]  We just made him lose control of his own job.
[47:20.030 --> 47:22.030]  You're going to pull some kind of lever and blow the air bar?
[47:22.030 --> 47:23.030]  So they asked me, Was that going to happen tonight?
[47:23.030 --> 47:24.030]  And I said, No.
[47:24.030 --> 47:25.030]  It's a cannabis show.
[47:25.030 --> 47:26.030]  There's no henna.
[47:26.030 --> 47:27.030]  There's no henny here.
[47:27.030 --> 47:28.030]  I'm not one for losing control.
[47:28.030 --> 47:31.030]  I did eat edibles and try to fly away on one episode.
[47:31.030 --> 47:32.030]  That was different.
[47:32.030 --> 47:34.030]  I needed a damn seat belt.
[47:34.030 --> 47:35.030]  I'm sure that wasn't.
[47:35.030 --> 47:37.030]  They said 350 milligrams in that peanut butter bar.
[47:37.030 --> 47:39.030]  It was more than that.
[47:39.030 --> 47:40.030]  It was more than 350.
[47:40.030 --> 47:41.030]  Probably came from Michigan.
[47:41.030 --> 47:42.030]  350 minus or plus?
[47:42.030 --> 47:43.030]  Plus 125.
[47:43.030 --> 47:46.030]  No, it was the Mountain Medicine peanut butter bar.
[47:46.030 --> 47:49.030]  It was labeled at 350, and as soon as I bit into it, I was like,
[47:49.030 --> 47:51.030]  That tastes just like pure weed.
[47:51.030 --> 47:54.030]  It was like biting into a brick of Mexican brick weed, and then I ate it.
[47:54.030 --> 47:58.030]  About 20 minutes later, I was like, Yeah, that was way more than 350 milligrams.
[47:58.030 --> 48:00.030]  I don't know if I was flying or melting.
[48:00.030 --> 48:01.030]  How long did it take?
[48:01.030 --> 48:02.030]  To hit me?
[48:02.030 --> 48:03.030]  Like 20 or 30 minutes.
[48:03.030 --> 48:05.030]  You can hear it in the podcast because I'm talking.
[48:05.030 --> 48:06.030]  I'm talking.
[48:06.030 --> 48:10.030]  When they're so overmedicated like that, half the time when you bite into it,
[48:10.030 --> 48:12.030]  you get distillate on your gums and shit.
[48:12.030 --> 48:14.030]  This was before distillate.
[48:14.030 --> 48:15.030]  This was before those days.
[48:15.030 --> 48:18.030]  This was when everything was cannabutter, and it just tasted like it squirted
[48:18.030 --> 48:19.030]  cannabutter.
[48:19.030 --> 48:20.030]  Yeah.
[48:20.030 --> 48:23.030]  You speed up that absorption rate with all that oil in your mouth.
[48:23.030 --> 48:24.030]  I can't do that.
[48:24.030 --> 48:27.030]  I'm just so scrunny anyway that the edibles hit me right away.
[48:27.030 --> 48:29.030]  Like 20 minutes later, I was just wrecked.
[48:29.030 --> 48:32.030]  That thing had to be 500 milligrams, maybe 6.
[48:32.030 --> 48:33.030]  I don't know.
[48:33.030 --> 48:34.030]  It fucked me up so quickly.
[48:34.030 --> 48:38.030]  I'm looking at you because it takes about 1,000 milligrams for me to even
[48:38.030 --> 48:39.030]  feel anything.
[48:39.030 --> 48:42.030]  I'm not going to say what I take regularly for a good reason.
[48:42.030 --> 48:45.030]  And then when I feel it, about a half hour later, I'm passed out.
[48:45.030 --> 48:46.030]  What the fuck?
[48:46.030 --> 48:52.030]  Josh said, how much is too much for you?
[48:52.030 --> 48:53.030]  500 is too much?
[48:53.030 --> 48:55.030]  What's your normal dose if you're going to eat edibles?
[48:55.030 --> 48:58.030]  He said 100, and he gave me the thing you do with your hands,
[48:58.030 --> 48:59.030]  like no fucking more.
[48:59.030 --> 49:00.030]  I'm out.
[49:00.030 --> 49:02.030]  He gave me that hand motion.
[49:02.030 --> 49:04.030]  We're going to give Josh a mic and let him talk for a little bit.
[49:04.030 --> 49:06.030]  Maybe 200 if I'm pushing it.
[49:06.030 --> 49:08.030]  If you're pushing it, how often do you eat edibles though?
[49:08.030 --> 49:10.030]  Every other day.
[49:10.030 --> 49:11.030]  Oh, shit.
[49:11.030 --> 49:12.030]  Okay.
[49:12.030 --> 49:13.030]  And you still haven't built up a tolerance?
[49:13.030 --> 49:16.030]  No, I just know what's too much and what's not.
[49:16.030 --> 49:17.030]  There you go.
[49:17.030 --> 49:18.030]  All right.
[49:18.030 --> 49:19.030]  Ride that line.
[49:19.030 --> 49:20.030]  There's no reason to build it up.
[49:20.030 --> 49:21.030]  That's true.
[49:21.030 --> 49:22.030]  Stay a cheap date.
[49:22.030 --> 49:23.030]  Stay a cheap date.
[49:23.030 --> 49:25.030]  So maybe one weekend you're going to try like 300 or 500 for us?
[49:25.030 --> 49:27.030]  What's that?
[49:27.030 --> 49:29.030]  One weekend you're going to throw down a 300 or 500 and just see what you
[49:29.030 --> 49:30.030]  could do?
[49:30.030 --> 49:35.030]  I ate a 500 the other night, and then I remember having a dream about I
[49:35.030 --> 49:37.030]  bought a Ferrari.
[49:37.030 --> 49:40.030]  Are you a Ferrari guy?
[49:40.030 --> 49:41.030]  No.
[49:42.030 --> 49:45.030]  I don't even think I've ever seen one up close.
[49:45.030 --> 49:47.030]  But you totally bought one in the dream?
[49:47.030 --> 49:48.030]  I had my dream.
[49:48.030 --> 49:49.030]  Were you just mobbing it?
[49:49.030 --> 49:51.030]  Just going, just tearing it up?
[49:51.030 --> 49:52.030]  It was red.
[49:52.030 --> 49:55.030]  Maybe deep inside, bro, you need to grow a mole and get a Ferrari.
[49:55.030 --> 49:57.030]  Something that you've just been dreaming about.
[49:57.030 --> 50:00.030]  I'm more like a Camaro limo or something.
[50:00.030 --> 50:02.030]  Yeah, I've seen your collection.
[50:02.030 --> 50:03.030]  Camaro limo.
[50:03.030 --> 50:05.030]  Are you going to jump it if you put it up on some ramps?
[50:05.030 --> 50:07.030]  Yeah, maybe.
[50:07.030 --> 50:09.030]  Jump over the alpaca?
[50:10.030 --> 50:15.030]  Yeah, or maybe we could just jump the alpaca over the limo, you know?
[50:15.030 --> 50:16.030]  Who knows?
[50:16.030 --> 50:18.030]  All right, this got weird pretty quick.
[50:18.030 --> 50:20.030]  We'd get TJ on the donkey.
[50:20.030 --> 50:21.030]  Who's TJ?
[50:21.030 --> 50:22.030]  Do I know TJ?
[50:22.030 --> 50:23.030]  TJ was our alpaca.
[50:23.030 --> 50:25.030]  You're going to want to explain that sentence a little more.
[50:25.030 --> 50:27.030]  Extension cord guy.
[50:27.030 --> 50:30.030]  Yeah, because we let TJ ride the donkey.
[50:32.030 --> 50:33.030]  What are you guys sipping over there?
[50:33.030 --> 50:34.030]  I see you double cupping it.
[50:34.030 --> 50:35.030]  Oh, I'm not.
[50:35.030 --> 50:38.030]  I took one sip off that and already knew that was too much for me.
[50:38.030 --> 50:40.030]  Granny's cannellini?
[50:40.030 --> 50:42.030]  Yeah, it's 500 milligrams.
[50:42.030 --> 50:43.030]  500 milligrams?
[50:43.030 --> 50:44.030]  Funk juice.
[50:44.030 --> 50:45.030]  Funk juice?
[50:45.030 --> 50:46.030]  There's an N in there, right?
[50:46.030 --> 50:47.030]  Funk, F-U-N-K.
[50:47.030 --> 50:48.030]  All right.
[50:48.030 --> 50:49.030]  Going to funk you up.
[50:49.030 --> 50:51.030]  Where did that come from?
[50:51.030 --> 50:52.030]  D.C.
[50:52.030 --> 50:54.030]  Oh, okay, everything's imported.
[50:54.030 --> 50:55.030]  Everything.
[50:55.030 --> 50:58.030]  Well, there's a little bit of local stuff here in front of us.
[50:58.030 --> 51:00.030]  Do you find that the drinks hit you more quickly?
[51:00.030 --> 51:03.030]  I think I'm high all the time.
[51:03.030 --> 51:04.030]  Well, that's true.
[51:04.030 --> 51:05.030]  You're kind of saturated.
[51:05.030 --> 51:08.030]  You know, I don't think I know what – yes, I do.
[51:08.030 --> 51:12.030]  I wake up for about an hour, and then I start dabbing.
[51:12.030 --> 51:13.030]  Okay.
[51:13.030 --> 51:16.030]  Sometimes I won't dab until the first break.
[51:16.030 --> 51:17.030]  I don't dab before.
[51:17.030 --> 51:18.030]  Really?
[51:18.030 --> 51:19.030]  Yeah, I'll wait until the first break.
[51:19.030 --> 51:23.030]  It's good to go in and get shit figured out and see what's going on for the day and then get it all set up.
[51:23.030 --> 51:24.030]  But I'm past that.
[51:24.030 --> 51:25.030]  I'm retired.
[51:25.030 --> 51:26.030]  Yeah, yeah, we'll show off.
[51:26.030 --> 51:27.030]  I don't have to.
[51:27.030 --> 51:31.030]  I've got to make a list of what to do and get my rhythm on and then take a couple of dabs so that I know I'm not fucking up.
[51:31.030 --> 51:33.030]  You've got to make it for that morning traffic still.
[51:33.030 --> 51:34.030]  You want your wits about you.
[51:34.030 --> 51:38.030]  And I run a large commercial grow, so there's always this game of the first thing you do in the morning –
[51:38.030 --> 51:39.030]  Fuck broke last night.
[51:39.030 --> 51:41.030]  Yeah, the first thing you do is go find out what fucked up last night.
[51:41.030 --> 51:44.030]  How big is a large commercial grow?
[51:44.030 --> 51:50.030]  There's one room has 55 lights, and we have seven rooms total, seven flower rooms, two bedrooms.
[51:50.030 --> 51:51.030]  That's big grow.
[51:51.030 --> 51:58.030]  There's a lot of stuff going on, and it's not understaffed, but it's barely staffed, and it's got days.
[51:58.030 --> 52:01.030]  Precision staffing is how we like to think of it.
[52:01.030 --> 52:06.030]  Yes, yeah, we could use you, but we don't want to pay you, so we're just going to keep going like we are.
[52:06.030 --> 52:11.030]  As long as I've known you, you've never lost your passion for cannabis.
[52:11.030 --> 52:13.030]  There's always something new to spark it in me.
[52:13.030 --> 52:18.030]  It started to kind of – I got overwhelmed with these grows, and then they gave me a brand new one.
[52:18.030 --> 52:23.030]  They're like, look at all these new lights you get and all these new tables and this new irrigation, and they brought me new strains.
[52:23.030 --> 52:26.030]  Work is work, but you still have a passion.
[52:26.030 --> 52:27.030]  I love cannabis.
[52:27.030 --> 52:30.030]  I don't know – who the hell would I be without cannabis?
[52:30.030 --> 52:33.030]  I would be a musician, and it wouldn't be a happy life because I'd be on the road.
[52:33.030 --> 52:34.030]  Jeff Montralis, I met that guy.
[52:34.030 --> 52:37.030]  I'd be on the road addicted to drugs, and that's not a future for me.
[52:37.030 --> 52:38.030]  This is the way to be.
[52:38.030 --> 52:39.030]  Would you be a politician?
[52:39.030 --> 52:40.030]  Without cannabis?
[52:40.030 --> 52:41.030]  Yeah.
[52:41.030 --> 52:43.030]  Probably would be a psychologist.
[52:43.030 --> 52:44.030]  Oh, boy.
[52:44.030 --> 52:47.030]  When I graduated college, I was going to go put broken teenagers back together.
[52:47.030 --> 52:49.030]  That's a good mission.
[52:49.030 --> 52:51.030]  Teenagers.
[52:51.030 --> 52:52.030]  Teenagers?
[52:52.030 --> 52:53.030]  Okay.
[52:53.030 --> 52:56.030]  So right as they're truly broken, and then you get to try to mess with them.
[52:56.030 --> 52:58.030]  I learned the hard way that that's way too late to intervene.
[52:58.030 --> 53:03.030]  Yeah, I've got a 15-year-old girl, and I was going to say that you're not going to change anything about them.
[53:03.030 --> 53:08.030]  After that, when I went and worked with the much younger kids, the 5-, 6-, 7-year-olds in social service care,
[53:08.030 --> 53:11.030]  they broke my psyche.
[53:11.030 --> 53:13.030]  That's why I was fucked up when we met.
[53:13.030 --> 53:16.030]  It was because I was still coming off that job and hadn't recovered yet.
[53:16.030 --> 53:17.030]  Oh, no.
[53:17.030 --> 53:19.030]  I don't think I could deal with that.
[53:19.030 --> 53:23.030]  No, every day they'd be like, here, there's a new kid coming in, and then they would hand you a notebook
[53:23.030 --> 53:25.030]  with the world's most horrible story in it.
[53:25.030 --> 53:28.030]  And that happened like twice a week for three years.
[53:28.030 --> 53:31.030]  That's like emotionally, that's more than one person.
[53:31.030 --> 53:35.030]  I can't even think about it in serious terms, and I don't like to dwell on that stuff.
[53:35.030 --> 53:37.030]  Your eyes look like you're distant.
[53:37.030 --> 53:39.030]  There was a whole different world that came about.
[53:39.030 --> 53:41.030]  I'm telling a trauma story right now.
[53:41.030 --> 53:44.030]  That kind of job could cause PTSD.
[53:44.030 --> 53:46.030]  No, it for surely can.
[53:46.030 --> 53:50.030]  I had nightmares for months and months after I left that industry.
[53:50.030 --> 53:54.030]  My aunt was a social worker in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and she loved it.
[53:54.030 --> 53:59.030]  It was her passion, but I was like, that's too emotional for me.
[53:59.030 --> 54:01.030]  I can't deal with that.
[54:01.030 --> 54:06.030]  The only positive part with working with the older kids was I had a little bit of an ability to yank
[54:06.030 --> 54:12.030]  the occasional kid out of the meat grinder before the system fully chewed them to death.
[54:12.030 --> 54:18.030]  But once I went to work with the younger kids, just like that level of fucked-up-edness,
[54:18.030 --> 54:22.030]  it's just it takes a certain type of person to psychologically come with it.
[54:22.030 --> 54:24.030]  How can that even exist?
[54:24.030 --> 54:25.030]  Yep.
[54:25.030 --> 54:29.030]  Well, you have to roll with it, and then you've got to do therapy sessions with the family.
[54:29.030 --> 54:31.030]  It's just, seriously, I didn't have the time.
[54:31.030 --> 54:32.030]  You didn't become invested.
[54:32.030 --> 54:33.030]  Nope.
[54:33.030 --> 54:35.030]  Yeah, you were way too young for that.
[54:35.030 --> 54:37.030]  You got your own family.
[54:37.030 --> 54:39.030]  But they needed people because it's so underfunded.
[54:39.030 --> 54:41.030]  They can't afford people who actually know what they're doing.
[54:41.030 --> 54:42.030]  Or care.
[54:42.030 --> 54:44.030]  So me right out of college, they were like, here's a bunch of gang kids.
[54:44.030 --> 54:46.030]  Good luck.
[54:46.030 --> 54:48.030]  Good luck.
[54:48.030 --> 54:50.030]  Yo, white mic.
[54:50.030 --> 54:52.030]  Take care of all these gang kids.
[54:52.030 --> 54:55.030]  Do you guys feel that, and I'm just asking because I am definitely doing this,
[54:55.030 --> 54:59.030]  do you guys feel like you go through phases where sometimes you can smoke all the hash
[54:59.030 --> 55:02.030]  and you don't get properly medicated or high enough or where you want to be,
[55:02.030 --> 55:06.030]  but then four or five days later you'll open up your jar and you'll try to take a dab
[55:06.030 --> 55:08.030]  and as soon as you hit it you're like, I am so high.
[55:08.030 --> 55:09.030]  I'm so high.
[55:09.030 --> 55:11.030]  And it'll last for maybe an hour even.
[55:11.030 --> 55:12.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:12.030 --> 55:16.030]  I'm going through one of those phases where just little tiny dabs have just been wrecking me.
[55:16.030 --> 55:17.030]  I'm not complaining.
[55:17.030 --> 55:19.030]  I just wondered if other people experience it.
[55:19.030 --> 55:22.030]  Have you taken a tolerance break or anything?
[55:22.030 --> 55:23.030]  I don't do that, Gail.
[55:23.030 --> 55:24.030]  Me either.
[55:24.030 --> 55:27.030]  I feel like I had a naturopath doctor.
[55:27.030 --> 55:31.030]  We were talking about things like I have stomach problems and stuff.
[55:31.030 --> 55:32.030]  We were just talking.
[55:32.030 --> 55:35.030]  They're a friend of mine and they actually ran the holistic clinic in the town I'm from.
[55:35.030 --> 55:37.030]  She's passed now, so this was a long time ago.
[55:37.030 --> 55:40.030]  But we were talking and she's like, so what are you doing for that stomach pain and stuff?
[55:40.030 --> 55:43.030]  And I was like, I just smoke like this much hash and I do this.
[55:43.030 --> 55:46.030]  And she's like, you better not ever stop smoking because if you do,
[55:46.030 --> 55:48.030]  whatever is really wrong with you is going to show.
[55:48.030 --> 55:50.030]  I was like, oh, oh, oh.
[55:50.030 --> 55:53.030]  So, yeah, I'm just going to keep consuming the way I am.
[55:53.030 --> 55:57.030]  I have a relative who cannabis is what's keeping him alive.
[55:57.030 --> 55:59.030]  And that's been true for like 25 years.
[55:59.030 --> 56:09.030]  And recently, the doctors that he's working with convinced him to get off cannabis completely.
[56:09.030 --> 56:12.030]  Just like give it 30 days, old man, see what happens.
[56:12.030 --> 56:14.030]  And he did it.
[56:14.030 --> 56:19.030]  On day 15, they were like, please, for the love of God, don't smoke a joint.
[56:19.030 --> 56:21.030]  Like you're going to die.
[56:21.030 --> 56:24.030]  Jeff, do you take CBD on the reg too?
[56:24.030 --> 56:26.030]  I do not take CBD.
[56:26.030 --> 56:28.030]  I don't like the way CBD makes me feel.
[56:28.030 --> 56:31.030]  CBD got me through my head injury at certain times.
[56:31.030 --> 56:34.030]  And then I feel like once I got past a certain point with the head injury,
[56:34.030 --> 56:36.030]  the CBD wasn't doing what I wanted it to.
[56:36.030 --> 56:39.030]  Were you only smoking it or were you using it in a tincture?
[56:39.030 --> 56:42.030]  I was taking pills and I was smoking dabs of it.
[56:42.030 --> 56:48.030]  When I first hit my head, it felt like I had, so you guys, just a reminder or update or whatever.
[56:48.030 --> 56:51.030]  I had a traumatic brain injury in April of back in the day.
[56:51.030 --> 56:53.030]  It was a couple years ago.
[56:53.030 --> 56:55.030]  Smash is headed to the top of a set of stairs.
[56:55.030 --> 56:57.030]  In a doorway, a low doorway.
[56:57.030 --> 57:01.030]  I got the low doorway, knocked myself clean at the top of some stairs,
[57:01.030 --> 57:03.030]  knocked myself out, fell down the stairs, woke up at the bottom of the stairs.
[57:03.030 --> 57:05.030]  A couple of friends were pulling me up the stairs.
[57:05.030 --> 57:08.030]  Had a traumatic brain injury, subdural hematoma.
[57:08.030 --> 57:10.030]  And untreated.
[57:10.030 --> 57:12.030]  Well, let's move forward.
[57:12.030 --> 57:14.030]  I had a few problems.
[57:14.030 --> 57:18.030]  But anyway, my head hurt fucking bad.
[57:18.030 --> 57:20.030]  And I was at Maddie and Spence's house.
[57:20.030 --> 57:25.030]  And Spence was making CBD concentrates for a cannabis cup.
[57:25.030 --> 57:27.030]  And he's like, dog, you need that CBD?
[57:27.030 --> 57:28.030]  And I was like, sure.
[57:28.030 --> 57:29.030]  And I took a couple of them.
[57:29.030 --> 57:31.030]  It's the stuff that ended up winning the cup.
[57:31.030 --> 57:33.030]  So I took a couple of big dabs of that.
[57:33.030 --> 57:36.030]  And each dab felt, it felt like I had a belt too tight around my head.
[57:36.030 --> 57:39.030]  Like you'd put a belt around my head and stomped on it and tried to, like, get a ratchet clamp.
[57:40.030 --> 57:43.030]  And when I took that CBD dab, it felt like you just took it off half a notch.
[57:43.030 --> 57:46.030]  And everybody in the room could see a difference in me.
[57:46.030 --> 57:48.030]  Maddie was like, are you feeling better?
[57:48.030 --> 57:50.030]  And I was like, dude, I am coming back.
[57:50.030 --> 57:52.030]  Because when I hit my head, I knocked the shit out of myself.
[57:52.030 --> 57:53.030]  I couldn't do math.
[57:53.030 --> 57:54.030]  Like, I'm not even kidding.
[57:54.030 --> 57:55.030]  I couldn't do math.
[57:55.030 --> 57:59.030]  Probably couldn't remember simple words like the, and.
[57:59.030 --> 58:01.030]  I could, but instead I would say pickle.
[58:01.030 --> 58:03.030]  Or, like, yeah.
[58:03.030 --> 58:04.030]  Yeah, I had really weird symptoms.
[58:04.030 --> 58:05.030]  I had other physical symptoms.
[58:05.030 --> 58:07.030]  I talk about my nervous boner.
[58:07.030 --> 58:09.030]  I would get a raging erection for no reason.
[58:09.030 --> 58:13.030]  If I got nervous or anxious, I would just get a huge boner.
[58:13.030 --> 58:15.030]  Which would just make me more anxious.
[58:15.030 --> 58:16.030]  How uncomfortable is that?
[58:16.030 --> 58:17.030]  Yeah, I'm an adult.
[58:17.030 --> 58:18.030]  I can't have a boner in public.
[58:18.030 --> 58:19.030]  It's fucking horrible.
[58:19.030 --> 58:20.030]  But, so I smoked.
[58:20.030 --> 58:22.030]  Then Spence was like, Doug, you need more of this CBD.
[58:22.030 --> 58:24.030]  We can see a difference in you.
[58:24.030 --> 58:26.030]  So I was smoking the CBD with Spence and he gave me a little bit of it.
[58:26.030 --> 58:28.030]  And it got me through it.
[58:28.030 --> 58:31.030]  And then I got past the dark times, I call it, of my head injury.
[58:31.030 --> 58:33.030]  There were terrible things going through my mind.
[58:33.030 --> 58:35.030]  I didn't know that I was going to make it through that.
[58:35.030 --> 58:37.030]  I didn't have friends like Mike and a few other people that were around.
[58:37.030 --> 58:41.030]  My mom, probably granny, a few other people that took good care of me.
[58:41.030 --> 58:43.030]  And they knew I had a brain injury.
[58:43.030 --> 58:45.030]  If I started saying weird shit, they'd just come hang out.
[58:45.030 --> 58:47.030]  And I'd be like, it's like 3 in the morning.
[58:47.030 --> 58:48.030]  Why are you still here?
[58:48.030 --> 58:49.030]  And they're like, it's cool, bro.
[58:49.030 --> 58:50.030]  I'm just going to hang out.
[58:50.030 --> 58:51.030]  And I'd be like, oh, I'm talking strange or something's going on.
[58:51.030 --> 58:53.030]  I could tell that that's why they're here.
[58:53.030 --> 58:55.030]  But I wasn't cognizant to figure out exactly why.
[58:55.030 --> 58:58.030]  But I knew, I was like subconsciously, I was like, you're just keeping an eye on me.
[58:58.030 --> 59:02.030]  You think I might hurt myself or might try to microwave the batteries or something.
[59:02.030 --> 59:03.030]  I don't know.
[59:03.030 --> 59:05.030]  I was doing weird and saying weird shit.
[59:05.030 --> 59:09.030]  So eventually, the CBD got me through the dark times.
[59:09.030 --> 59:12.030]  And I realized that the high THC was what I needed now.
[59:12.030 --> 59:14.030]  Because the pain was gone.
[59:14.030 --> 59:18.030]  The thoughts scrambling and the word disassociation.
[59:18.030 --> 59:22.030]  So you guys, I clearly was asking my mom to pass me a banana to put in a smoothie.
[59:22.030 --> 59:24.030]  And I kept calling it a fucking burrito.
[59:24.030 --> 59:26.030]  And was getting angry at my mom for not giving me the burrito.
[59:26.030 --> 59:28.030]  Because she didn't understand what you were.
[59:28.030 --> 59:29.030]  Give me the goddamn burrito.
[59:29.030 --> 59:30.030]  And she's like, there's not a burrito over here.
[59:30.030 --> 59:32.030]  And I was like, I'm fucking pointing at a burrito, mom.
[59:32.030 --> 59:33.030]  I want that burrito.
[59:33.030 --> 59:34.030]  Why are you fucking with me?
[59:34.030 --> 59:35.030]  It was making me really mad.
[59:35.030 --> 59:36.030]  Like, why would my mom do this to me?
[59:36.030 --> 59:37.030]  I want that burrito.
[59:37.030 --> 59:38.030]  I can see it.
[59:38.030 --> 59:39.030]  I want to touch it.
[59:39.030 --> 59:40.030]  I want to eat it.
[59:40.030 --> 59:41.030]  I meant banana.
[59:41.030 --> 59:42.030]  She was really having my back.
[59:42.030 --> 59:43.030]  So things were weird.
[59:43.030 --> 59:44.030]  But that was coming back.
[59:44.030 --> 59:46.030]  All my signals were going to the right path.
[59:46.030 --> 59:49.030]  But my thoughts would, I don't know, they would scatter.
[59:49.030 --> 59:51.030]  It would feel like I got a filing cabinet in my brain.
[59:51.030 --> 59:52.030]  And somebody just dumped out the files.
[59:52.030 --> 59:53.030]  And they were still there.
[59:53.030 --> 59:54.030]  I just couldn't get to them as quickly.
[59:54.030 --> 59:56.030]  I'd be like, oh, you want to know my name?
[59:56.030 --> 59:57.030]  Hold on.
[59:57.030 --> 59:58.030]  And I'd have to shuffle through all the papers.
[59:58.030 --> 59:59.030]  And then we'd find it.
[59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.030]  And I'd be like, oh, here's my birthday.
[01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.030]  I know what it is.
[01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.030]  And I could tell you.
[01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:04.030]  Then I started smoking the high THC stuff.
[01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:05.030]  And I started putting it back together.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:09.030]  The puzzle pieces, when I start getting that, like, I can't remember shit.
[01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:11.030]  The high THC, the limonene, and THC.
[01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.030]  Do you still get that?
[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.030]  I don't know because I stay so well medicated.
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.030]  And I don't know.
[01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.030]  I had brain farts before I hit my head.
[01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.030]  I'm trying to think too many things.
[01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:25.030]  I'm responsible for 15 employees, two grows, a daughter, friends, whatever else.
[01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.030]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, podcast.
[01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:28.030]  Podcast.
[01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:29.030]  I'm driving, putting on my shoes.
[01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.030]  I've got so many things.
[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:33.030]  There's going to be a fucking brain fart in there somewhere.
[01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:37.030]  I think I can tell the difference between the brain injury brain farts and the natural,
[01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.030]  you're just thinking too many things or you had too many dabs, brain farts.
[01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.030]  So now what does the CBD make you feel like?
[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:46.030]  It makes me Gumby-like.
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:50.030]  It makes me not feel like I've got complete control of my fingers and my hands.
[01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:53.030]  Like, if I go to try to – you ever been in the cold and your thumbs are too cold and you can't text?
[01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.030]  That's what CBD does to my thumbs.
[01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.030]  I feel like I'm missing.
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.030]  I'm not hitting the O, I'm hitting the P.
[01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.030]  That's strange.
[01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.030]  Yeah.
[01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:02.030]  It just makes my dexterity go spunky.
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.030]  And so I don't smoke it.
[01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:08.030]  When people are like, this is mad CBD, I'm like, oh, give that to Granny, who it works for,
[01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:11.030]  or Mike, who it works for because it's a waste on me.
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.030]  It just doesn't do what I want it to do.
[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:15.030]  We're on tinctures.
[01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.030]  And it ruins my THC high.
[01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:18.030]  Yes.
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.030]  Because it takes me a little bit.
[01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:21.030]  I'm medicating.
[01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.030]  I'm not smoking.
[01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.030]  The first three dabs are medicine.
[01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.030]  The fourth and fifth one, that's probably recreational.
[01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:29.030]  But it takes me a minute to get where I need to be medicinally.
[01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.030]  I got to smoke to build it up.
[01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:38.030]  It's like if you take a, whatever, 250-milligram pill, I got to get my 250 milligrams of whatever in my body by consuming it before I start rotating.
[01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:39.030]  That's why we like to dab.
[01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.030]  Yeah, just go in.
[01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.030]  Just go in.
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.030]  That's the beautiful part of inhalation is it's almost instant.
[01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:46.030]  And I don't want to fuck that up with CBD.
[01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.030]  I don't want to just –
[01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:53.030]  I run into that all the time because I eat a lot of – well, not a lot for the people at this table, but a lot for civilians.
[01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.030]  CBD every day.
[01:01:55.030 --> 01:02:02.030]  And if I've been hurting all day and we've been running around really hard and, like, my knees, my hips, my back are all killing on harvest day.
[01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:05.030]  We harvest 165 plants in one day.
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:14.030]  On days like that, I'll end up consuming four or five times the normal amount of CBD, THC pills that I normally take.
[01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:28.030]  And on those days when I go home and I'm like, all right, end of the day, kids asleep, want to relax, want to get a nice buzz going, I'll take four or five bong hits and I'm like sober as a judge.
[01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:29.030]  Yep.
[01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:34.030]  Give it a couple of minutes, take a dab, give it a couple minutes, well, cough for a couple minutes.
[01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:35.030]  Mike likes to cough.
[01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.030]  I cough.
[01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.030]  And then I'll start to get to where I want to be.
[01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:48.030]  But on days where I haven't been hurting and it's been office work all day, maybe I didn't even take a pill that day, I get home, that first bong rip puts me halfway to where I want to be.
[01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.030]  It's so much quicker.
[01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:53.030]  I just think we really need CBD.
[01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:55.030]  I take tincture every morning.
[01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.030]  I don't smoke it anymore.
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:02.030]  But I feel like it's – what's the drug they give you when you're – it's like Norcan to your heroin.
[01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:05.030]  It's like the – it's the same thing for my THC high.
[01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:08.030]  They make CBD rescue pills for people who way over consume.
[01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:09.030]  Yeah, yeah, and I don't want that.
[01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:12.030]  I spend so much time and money trying to consume all this THC.
[01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:17.030]  Yeah, but don't you believe like if you take a tincture in the morning, that's not like smoking it.
[01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.030]  Yes, smoking it is going to do something different.
[01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.030]  I don't know.
[01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.030]  I should try.
[01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:24.030]  I just don't feel like I go the other way.
[01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:28.030]  Well, I'll give you a success story.
[01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.030]  I would love to hear it.
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:31.030]  Kevin's been taken off the transplant list.
[01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:34.030]  Fixed himself with CBD.
[01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:36.030]  With CBD and THC.
[01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:41.030]  Do you mind telling more – a little backup story about what he was going to have transplanted and what you've cured with it?
[01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.030]  Don't go too far that you're not comfortable.
[01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:44.030]  I wouldn't ask for too much details.
[01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:47.030]  In 93, he was diagnosed with hepatitis C.
[01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:52.030]  Went through several different treatments to try to rid him of it.
[01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.030]  Every treatment gave him worse symptoms.
[01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.030]  He never got rid of the hepatitis C.
[01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:03.030]  Put him into cirrhosis of the liver.
[01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:10.030]  Finally, in 2011, they put him on a new experimental drug.
[01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:11.030]  It's what you see on TV now.
[01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:13.030]  It's called Harvoni.
[01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:24.030]  It rid him of the hepatitis C, but there was so much damage done to his liver that he had been listed for a transplant for a liver.
[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:29.030]  But he was also on so many other drugs because of all the other symptoms that come along with that.
[01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.030]  That's how he became that opioid zombie.
[01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:37.030]  Once we got him off all the opioids and he started coming around like a normal human being again,
[01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:42.030]  started taking the CBD tincture with me every day,
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:46.030]  smoking – he doesn't dab, but he will smoke flour.
[01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:51.030]  His checkup in January, his liver functions are all coming back
[01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:55.030]  to the point that the head doctor came in and went,
[01:04:55.030 --> 01:05:00.030]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, left the room, came back with Kevin's whole team and said,
[01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:03.030]  Look at Kevin, look at how good he is.
[01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:10.030]  Said, I know what you're doing, keep doing it, you look so good, your functions are so well.
[01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:13.030]  How do you feel about us removing you from the transplant list?
[01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:17.030]  That's pretty impressive.
[01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:20.030]  Kind of, it was like, are you kidding me?
[01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:22.030]  I was taking a dab, but that is amazing.
[01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:25.030]  Congratulations to you and Kevin because that's the greatest news.
[01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.030]  That's huge news.
[01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:28.030]  That makes life so much easier for both of you.
[01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:30.030]  Look at us, we're out there having fun together.
[01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:32.030]  Yeah, and you can see in the pictures that you guys are having a great time.
[01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.030]  And he doesn't look sick anymore.
[01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.030]  I mean, yeah, he's still got issues.
[01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:41.030]  He's got diabetes, so he gets tired in his feet.
[01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:46.030]  He's got neuropathy and he gets tired because he's still got liver issues, but, hell.
[01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.030]  Way better than what you thought was coming for you.
[01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:49.030]  I thought he was dying.
[01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:50.030]  Yeah, no, you get to keep him.
[01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.030]  He gets to keep you.
[01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.030]  I hope you guys have a lot more years together.
[01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:55.030]  We do.
[01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.030]  Do you guys feel like cannabis is messing with your dreams?
[01:05:58.030 --> 01:05:59.030]  Do you dream when you smoke?
[01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:00.030]  No.
[01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:01.030]  No?
[01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:07.030]  I have, so people talk about they smoke Indica to go to sleep and Sativas during the day.
[01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.030]  I do the opposite, kind of.
[01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:13.030]  I like to smoke a heavy Sativa right before bed and get lit like, like fucking twerk.
[01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:15.030]  But then how can you sleep?
[01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:19.030]  Oh, I just lay down and giggle and giggle until I fall asleep and I have the best dreams.
[01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:23.030]  I fly away, I go to all the greatest places, I do all the greatest shit.
[01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:26.030]  I'll take a big dab of that pre-98 and it will knock me out.
[01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:32.030]  Oh yeah, yeah, if I need like, well, like on Friday night, like tonight it's Friday,
[01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:36.030]  I can sleep in a little bit tomorrow, I don't have to get up when the alarm goes off, so I'll just get,
[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:38.030]  and I'm tired because I work, you know what I mean?
[01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:39.030]  That's how I sleep, I'm tired.
[01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:41.030]  My body is, I put in the hours.
[01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.030]  We carry a bunch of stuff, we grow a bunch of weed.
[01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.030]  Especially since everybody's harvesting now.
[01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:51.030]  Yes, but, so I'll smoke that, a super heavy Sativa right before I go to bed and I'll have the best dreams.
[01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:55.030]  I dream, like, I don't know, I have all the dreams that you think you can dream about,
[01:06:55.030 --> 01:07:01.030]  like flying dreams, fucking Ferrari dreams, weird sex dreams, swimming in the sky dreams,
[01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:03.030]  living in a tree dreams.
[01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:04.030]  I don't dream that much.
[01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.030]  Oh, I have the craziest dreams when I smoke before bed.
[01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:10.030]  I tried your big Sativa dab at bed trick and I just stayed up all night doing fucking laundry,
[01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.030]  and it did not work at all for me.
[01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:13.030]  See, that's how I would be.
[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.030]  You just gotta get so, so stoned.
[01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.030]  Do you dream, Mike?
[01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:18.030]  Not when I consume.
[01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:19.030]  Really?
[01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:20.030]  It's one of the things I really like about it.
[01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:22.030]  That's what a lot of people say.
[01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:24.030]  I had fucked up dreams before I started consuming.
[01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.030]  Yeah, I'd lucid dream either way.
[01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:31.030]  I had the weirdest dreams when I was forced, like, two years sober in Wyoming.
[01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:32.030]  Oh, I bet.
[01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:38.030]  My lucid dreams turned to, like, not cool fun dreams, but to, like, all kinds of weird, like,
[01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:41.030]  getting busted for drug dreams.
[01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:43.030]  Oh, not Jones and so hard.
[01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:49.030]  You guys, I haven't eaten meat in, I can say, realistically, I know 2001,
[01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:53.030]  I went on a fish tour with my friend Rob, and I was a pain in the ass because I wasn't eating meat,
[01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:57.030]  so there was a lot of Subway and a lot of Taco Bell on that tour.
[01:07:57.030 --> 01:08:00.030]  Yeah, shout out to Rob for putting up with that.
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:04.030]  So it's been since at least 2001 since I've consumed meat,
[01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:09.030]  and I had dreams the other night that I was eating, I was at a restaurant where I grew up,
[01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.030]  and they had Angelo's Burgers in Bellflower, California.
[01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:14.030]  They used to have the most delicious fucking steak sandwiches ever.
[01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.030]  You're so calm, bro.
[01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:19.030]  I was sitting there, it might be, because I'm getting hungry right now talking about it.
[01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:22.030]  I was eating a steak sandwich, and everybody at the table gave me that look,
[01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:25.030]  like if I were to just pull out crack right now and smoke it, everyone gave me that same look.
[01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:29.030]  They're like, hey, you're eating a steak sandwich, bro.
[01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:33.030]  And my answer was, mmm, that's fucking delicious, and I just kept chewing it up.
[01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:36.030]  And everyone at the table was like, dude, you're a strict vegetarian.
[01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:38.030]  And I was like, oh, it doesn't look like it, no.
[01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:42.030]  And I was just eating that motherfucker, and then I woke up and I was like, huh.
[01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:45.030]  Did you do this? Make sure you didn't have no grease around.
[01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:50.030]  I did wake up one night, I took some medicine, and I woke up, I took some Mucinex,
[01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:54.030]  and I woke up with a fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich in my bed that I do not remember making.
[01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:57.030]  I full-on made that shit in my sleep on the Mucinex.
[01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:58.030]  Good old Farmy's.
[01:08:58.030 --> 01:09:02.030]  You've got to love it. You've got to OD on the Farmy's and see what happens in your life.
[01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:06.030]  Too many liquids and take a fat dab and wake up with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich next to you.
[01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:07.030]  Nothing weird happened, I hope.
[01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:09.030]  But where the fuck was I?
[01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:11.030]  Somebody put me back on track.
[01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.030]  I think we've got to wrap it up. It's almost closing time in the church.
[01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:15.030]  I was trying to get out of here.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:17.030]  Church is almost over, you guys.
[01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:18.030]  Church ain't supposed to close.
[01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.030]  It's a perfect way to end a Rasta Jeff story where I got lost.
[01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:24.030]  Stay tuned, I'll listen to this, and we'll talk about it on episode two.
[01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:27.030]  We'll get all these people back into part two.
[01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:30.030]  All right. Granny, I like the idea of wrapping it up.
[01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:31.030]  I want to thank everybody for coming.
[01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:33.030]  Granny, thanks for putting this together.
[01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:34.030]  This was a great time.
[01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:35.030]  Thanks for getting me super dabbed out.
[01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:36.030]  You've got some tangy dabs.
[01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:38.030]  I had some hardcore OG.
[01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:44.030]  We took some green thumb rosin dabs, which you guys changed my opinion of rosin.
[01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:45.030]  I liked it. It was delicious.
[01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:46.030]  That was pretty good rosin.
[01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:47.030]  That was delicious.
[01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.030]  It tasted amazing, but I coughed for more than normal.
[01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:50.030]  That was for sure.
[01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:52.030]  And you even said that it lingered.
[01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:53.030]  It's heavy on the lungs.
[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:54.030]  It is kind of heavy.
[01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:57.030]  Rev, thanks for inviting us to the church and opening the church to us.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.030]  We'll be back. We'll come take some dabs here.
[01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.030]  This is a great place.
[01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.030]  We'll come record some more shows here.
[01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.030]  This is awesome.
[01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:05.030]  Enjoy yourselves.
[01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:07.030]  I rock. Thanks for jumping in for a minute, bro.
[01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:08.030]  No problem, man.
[01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:10.030]  I love having you guys here.
[01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:13.030]  If you have more weird dreams, come tell us about them on the show.
[01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:16.030]  I have weird days like every day.
[01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:20.030]  I could probably entertain your show pretty good with some stories.
[01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.030]  Next time, we're just going to strap you up with a mic and let you go.
[01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:23.030]  All right.
[01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:24.030]  Thanks, brother. Thanks for hanging out with us.
[01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:25.030]  Keep the grow going.
[01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:27.030]  Cracker Mike, thanks for driving up with me.
[01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:29.030]  Thanks for having a great podcast, bro.
[01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.030]  Yeah, man. Road trip. This was great.
[01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:32.030]  Yeah, we're going to go find some food after this.
[01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:33.030]  That's the mission.
[01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:35.030]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to wrap up the podcast.
[01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.030]  Does anybody have any social media they would like to shout out?
[01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:40.030]  Make sure you follow Dabbing Granny on all the social media, especially Instagram.
[01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:43.030]  That's about the only place I go anymore.
[01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:44.030]  That's what you're doing now. Is it dabbing underscore granny?
[01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:45.030]  Dabbing underscore granny.

[01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:55.030]  That's about the only cool person that follows.
[01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:56.030]  That's pretty cool.
[01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:58.030]  Yeah, especially as a Republican.
[01:10:58.030 --> 01:11:00.030]  Swing votes.
[01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:02.030]  We'll come back and have more talk about that next time.
[01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:04.030]  Of course, I rock Watts.

[01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:13.030]  I R O C K.
[01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:15.030]  I R O C K, like I rock.
[01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:16.030]  Yeah, not like the car?
[01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:17.030]  No.
[01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.030]  Not like you rock them?
[01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.030]  No, he rocks.
[01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:20.030]  It's because he rocks Watts.
[01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:21.030]  He rocks those Watts. He's a good grower.
[01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:24.030]  Make sure you follow I rock and, of course, follow Cracker Mike.
