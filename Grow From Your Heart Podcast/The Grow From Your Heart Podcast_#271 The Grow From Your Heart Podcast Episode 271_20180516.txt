[02:16.100 --> 02:21.100]  But I'm going to let the music play for a couple of seconds and when we get back, we will be at Elevate Glass.
[02:25.610 --> 02:28.610]  All right, I have hit record, so everybody behave yourselves.
[02:28.610 --> 02:31.610]  Don't say anything that you wouldn't want your mom and your friends to hear now.
[02:31.610 --> 02:33.610]  Good thing my mom's really rad.
[02:33.610 --> 02:34.610]  Is your mom really rad?
[02:34.610 --> 02:36.610]  She's super, super, super rad.
[02:36.610 --> 02:38.610]  Is your mom a cannabis consumer?
[02:38.610 --> 02:40.610]  I mean, like low-key.
[02:41.610 --> 02:42.610]  You know.
[02:42.610 --> 02:44.610]  Everybody knows now, so high-key.
[02:44.610 --> 02:47.610]  Oh, brum-bum. That was really punny.
[02:47.610 --> 02:48.610]  That was funny.
[02:48.610 --> 02:51.610]  All right. So, have you ever smoked with your mom?
[02:51.610 --> 02:52.610]  I have, yeah.
[02:52.610 --> 02:55.610]  You have? Does she know what you are doing here in Colorado?
[02:55.610 --> 02:59.610]  Yes, she does. She actually loves it. She came to the shop not too long ago when she was here visiting.

[05:53.610 --> 05:54.610]  Tookus.
[05:54.610 --> 05:56.610]  There's a little bit of a pre-show conversation there.
[05:56.610 --> 05:58.610]  All right, thank you for joining me, Rebecca.

[06:08.610 --> 06:09.610]  All right.
[06:09.610 --> 06:10.610]  All right.
[06:10.610 --> 06:11.610]  We're still good.
[06:11.610 --> 06:12.610]  We're just yanking mic cables and everything, guys.
[06:12.610 --> 06:13.610]  Don't worry.
[06:13.610 --> 06:14.610]  Sitting directly in front of me, do we call you Dabigail?
[06:14.610 --> 06:15.610]  Are you Abby?
[06:15.610 --> 06:16.610]  I am Dabigail.

[06:19.610 --> 06:20.610]  Yes, Dabigail6.
[06:20.610 --> 06:22.610]  You do a lot of Snapchatting.
[06:22.610 --> 06:24.610]  Do you want people to follow your Snapchat?
[06:24.610 --> 06:25.610]  They can follow me on Snapchat.
[06:26.610 --> 06:28.610]  I think I'm on Snapchat as Newman6.
[06:28.610 --> 06:29.610]  That sounds right.
[06:29.610 --> 06:30.610]  I think so.
[06:30.610 --> 06:31.610]  Newman6.
[06:31.610 --> 06:32.610]  Follow her on Snapchat, you guys.
[06:32.610 --> 06:33.610]  That sounds creepy.
[06:33.610 --> 06:34.610]  That sounds right.
[06:34.610 --> 06:35.610]  You know.
[06:35.610 --> 06:36.610]  Pass the mic over here.
[06:36.610 --> 06:37.610]  You totally know.
[06:37.610 --> 06:38.610]  You've got a troll.
[06:38.610 --> 06:39.610]  Yeah.
[06:39.610 --> 06:40.610]  Usually I'm the one trolling people.
[06:40.610 --> 06:41.610]  What's with you, Linda?
[06:41.610 --> 06:42.610]  You have competition, Jeff.
[06:42.610 --> 06:43.610]  Come on.
[06:43.610 --> 06:44.610]  Step it up.
[06:44.610 --> 06:45.610]  I like it.
[06:45.610 --> 06:46.610]  I like it.
[06:46.610 --> 06:47.610]  You were the first person that I met the first time I ever came in to Elevate.
[06:47.610 --> 06:48.610]  Yeah, I specifically remember.
[06:48.610 --> 06:49.610]  I actually met you like two or three times before anybody else had the pleasure of really
[06:49.610 --> 06:50.610]  like knowing.
[06:50.610 --> 06:51.610]  Yeah.
[06:52.610 --> 06:53.610]  And then I finally came in and a whole bunch of girls came from the back and gave me a
[06:53.610 --> 06:54.610]  giant hug and they're like, we've heard about you.
[06:54.610 --> 06:55.610]  And I was like, this is like one of the coolest things that's ever happened to me.
[06:55.610 --> 06:56.610]  I do remember the girl hug with Jeff.
[06:56.610 --> 06:57.610]  I do remember.
[06:57.610 --> 06:58.610]  I think there was a picture.
[06:58.610 --> 06:59.610]  There was a Snapchat picture.
[06:59.610 --> 07:00.610]  There was.
[07:00.610 --> 07:01.610]  Yeah.
[07:01.610 --> 07:02.610]  I do remember.
[07:02.610 --> 07:03.610]  So ladies and gentlemen, who we are talking to is Miss Lydia from Elevate Glass.
[07:03.610 --> 07:04.610]  Do you have an Instagram page?
[07:04.610 --> 07:05.610]  I do, yeah.
[07:05.610 --> 07:06.610]  But it's just my name.
[07:06.610 --> 07:07.610]  It's really boring.
[07:07.610 --> 07:08.610]  I feel like I need to change it.
[07:08.610 --> 07:09.610]  Is it your full name?
[07:09.610 --> 07:10.610]  Yeah, it is.
[07:10.610 --> 07:11.610]  Tell them your full name so they can stalk you.
[07:11.610 --> 07:12.610]  Oh, come on.
[07:12.610 --> 07:13.610]  I'm not going to do that.
[07:14.610 --> 07:15.610]  I'm like super German.
[07:15.610 --> 07:16.610]  Okay, Lydia Renninger.
[07:16.610 --> 07:17.610]  So it's L-Y-D-Y-A-R-E-N-N-I-N-G-E-R.
[07:17.610 --> 07:18.610]  That's not that hard.
[07:18.610 --> 07:19.610]  All one word.
[07:19.610 --> 07:20.610]  All one word.
[07:20.610 --> 07:21.610]  I know, it's really hard.
[07:21.610 --> 07:22.610]  Come up.
[07:22.610 --> 07:23.610]  You spelled Lydia right because nobody ever spells Lydia right.
[07:23.610 --> 07:24.610]  Yeah, nobody ever spells it right.
[07:24.610 --> 07:25.610]  L-Y-D-Y-A.
[07:25.610 --> 07:26.610]  Okay.
[07:26.610 --> 07:27.610]  Come up with a good name for me.
[07:27.610 --> 07:28.610]  I'll do it.
[07:28.610 --> 07:29.610]  I'll do it.
[07:29.610 --> 07:30.610]  I'll do it.
[07:30.610 --> 07:31.610]  I'll do it.
[07:31.610 --> 07:32.610]  I'll do it.
[07:32.610 --> 07:33.610]  I'll do it.

[07:35.610 --> 07:36.610]  I'll do it.
[07:36.610 --> 07:37.610]  I'll do it.
[07:37.610 --> 07:38.610]  I'll do it.
[07:38.610 --> 07:39.610]  I'll do it.
[07:39.610 --> 07:40.610]  L-Y-D-Y-A.
[07:40.610 --> 07:41.610]  Okay.
[07:41.610 --> 07:42.610]  Come up with a good name for me.
[07:42.610 --> 07:47.610]  All day long, I was posting about this podcast.
[07:47.610 --> 07:52.610]  And I knew Lydia was going to be here, but I didn't know what to tag her.
[07:52.610 --> 07:55.610]  So I just didn't put her in the picture.
[07:55.610 --> 07:56.610]  I know.
[07:56.610 --> 07:59.610]  It wasn't that I don't love you.
[07:59.610 --> 08:00.610]  I know.
[08:00.610 --> 08:01.610]  I know you do love me.
[08:01.610 --> 08:03.610]  What's easier than just her name also?
[08:03.610 --> 08:04.610]  That's the most simple tag you can find.
[08:04.610 --> 08:07.610]  I could have done, I could have done hashtag.
[08:07.610 --> 08:08.610]  You're absolutely right.
[08:08.610 --> 08:09.610]  She's throwing up hashtag gang signs again.
[08:09.610 --> 08:11.610]  I love the gang sign for hashtag.
[08:11.610 --> 08:13.610]  That's my new favorite thing for the day.
[08:13.610 --> 08:14.610]  Lydia, thanks for joining me.
[08:14.610 --> 08:15.610]  Thanks for always shooting me great.
[08:15.610 --> 08:19.610]  It's because of you that I kept coming back to this place because there are tons of glass shops.
[08:19.610 --> 08:20.610]  Thanks, guys.
[08:20.610 --> 08:22.610]  And of course, dude, I love you, Rasta Jeff.
[08:22.610 --> 08:23.610]  Always have.
[08:23.610 --> 08:31.610]  From the moment your immense height walked into the building and I realized how really small I was, I liked him.
[08:31.610 --> 08:32.610]  No, I think you're average.
[08:32.610 --> 08:34.610]  I think I'm just above average in height.
[08:34.610 --> 08:35.610]  I'm pretty short.
[08:36.610 --> 08:39.610]  I mean, I thought I was like teeny.
[08:39.610 --> 08:42.610]  We pride ourself on our customer service, so that makes me really happy.
[08:42.610 --> 08:43.610]  You guys do a great job.
[08:43.610 --> 08:44.610]  You ladies do a great job.
[08:44.610 --> 08:46.610]  Are there any men that work here at the Elevate stores?
[08:46.610 --> 08:47.610]  One.
[08:47.610 --> 08:50.610]  Currently one, and there's about to be three.
[08:50.610 --> 08:51.610]  Oh, you're going to change things.
[08:51.610 --> 08:54.610]  I've only seen one male ever that has worked here ever before.
[08:54.610 --> 08:55.610]  Oh, yeah?
[08:55.610 --> 08:56.610]  Yeah.
[08:56.610 --> 08:57.610]  Brandon is his name.
[08:57.610 --> 08:58.610]  Yes, Brandon.
[08:58.610 --> 08:59.610]  Yes.
[08:59.610 --> 09:00.610]  How do you do?
[09:00.610 --> 09:01.610]  Was he all right?
[09:01.610 --> 09:02.610]  You know, we were all, it was the day that I came and it was super busy and we just hung out.
[09:02.610 --> 09:04.610]  So he had like, you know, had nothing to judge him on.
[09:04.610 --> 09:05.610]  He was a great guy.
[09:05.610 --> 09:07.610]  He gave me a high five and we talked about Instagram.
[09:07.610 --> 09:08.610]  He's the best.
[09:08.610 --> 09:09.610]  He really is the best.
[09:09.610 --> 09:10.610]  We're all about those high fives.
[09:10.610 --> 09:11.610]  I love fucking with him.
[09:11.610 --> 09:14.610]  Are there other ladies that usually work here that we should give a shout out to?
[09:14.610 --> 09:16.610]  Heidi and Mac Daddy.
[09:16.610 --> 09:17.610]  Oh, Mac Daddy, without a doubt.
[09:17.610 --> 09:18.610]  Oh, yeah.
[09:18.610 --> 09:19.610]  What's up, Daddy Mac?
[09:19.610 --> 09:20.610]  We love you, Mac Daddy.
[09:20.610 --> 09:21.610]  Yeah, why aren't you here?
[09:21.610 --> 09:22.610]  We miss you.
[09:22.610 --> 09:23.610]  We wish you were here.
[09:23.610 --> 09:24.610]  We miss Heidi.
[09:24.610 --> 09:25.610]  We miss all our counterparts.
[09:25.610 --> 09:26.610]  And Heidi.
[09:26.610 --> 09:27.610]  Heidi's the tall one with the dark hair.
[09:27.610 --> 09:29.610]  And the tattoos and the beautifully, like, ornate artwork.
[09:29.610 --> 09:33.610]  I've only had the pleasure of working with her once and she's kind of quiet, but she is super great.
[09:34.610 --> 09:35.610]  She is.
[09:35.610 --> 09:36.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:36.610 --> 09:37.610]  She's really unique.
[09:37.610 --> 09:39.610]  Until you get her out of her shell, then she's not so quiet.
[09:39.610 --> 09:40.610]  Okay.
[09:40.610 --> 09:41.610]  Well, I'll get her out of that shell one time.
[09:41.610 --> 09:42.610]  Well, she's super smart.
[09:42.610 --> 09:44.610]  Like, she teaches me shit that I never, ever would have any idea.
[09:44.610 --> 09:45.610]  What did she teach you?
[09:45.610 --> 09:50.610]  That mycelium is actually the real word for mushrooms and that they're growing under,
[09:50.610 --> 09:55.610]  like, these giant interwebs under the ground and that they feel everything and, like, mushrooms
[09:55.610 --> 09:56.610]  are the birth of everything.
[09:56.610 --> 10:00.610]  And we're only 50% away from having the same DNA.
[10:00.610 --> 10:01.610]  Did you know that?
[10:01.610 --> 10:02.610]  And she's all about-
[10:02.610 --> 10:03.610]  That's amazing shit.
[10:03.610 --> 10:04.610]  I did not know all of that.
[10:04.610 --> 10:05.610]  No, Google that.
[10:05.610 --> 10:07.610]  It's, like, legit because I called BS.
[10:07.610 --> 10:08.610]  I was like, are you for real?
[10:08.610 --> 10:09.610]  I'm just going to put the mics down.
[10:09.610 --> 10:10.610]  I got my computer right behind me.
[10:10.610 --> 10:11.610]  We're just going to go Google some mushroom stuff.
[10:11.610 --> 10:13.610]  We'll catch up with you guys a little bit later.
[10:13.610 --> 10:14.610]  Thanks for listening.
[10:14.610 --> 10:15.610]  Heck yeah.
[10:15.610 --> 10:18.610]  She's all about medieval psychedelics too.
[10:18.610 --> 10:23.610]  And she has, like, some, like, slav, slave, however you say it.
[10:23.610 --> 10:24.610]  Sav?
[10:24.610 --> 10:25.610]  Sav.
[10:25.610 --> 10:28.610]  I love that.
[10:28.610 --> 10:29.610]  All the right letters.
[10:29.610 --> 10:30.610]  All of the right letters.
[10:30.610 --> 10:31.610]  I love that.
[10:31.610 --> 10:35.610]  We may have taken a bunch of dabs, and Rebecca doesn't dab, but I think a couple of us blew
[10:35.610 --> 10:39.610]  them at her, and I think she- her eyes are a little pinkish.
[10:39.610 --> 10:40.610]  Yeah?
[10:40.610 --> 10:41.610]  Her eyes are a little pinkish.
[10:41.610 --> 10:42.610]  It definitely did blow them at her.
[10:42.610 --> 10:43.610]  Definitely.
[10:43.610 --> 10:44.610]  Definitely.
[10:44.610 --> 10:45.610]  She might be a little medicated now.
[10:45.610 --> 10:46.610]  But she just made some psychedelic.
[10:46.610 --> 10:50.610]  Some rub that you can rub on your arms and get psychedelic?
[10:50.610 --> 10:51.610]  Dude, she's magical.
[10:51.610 --> 10:52.610]  She's magic.
[10:52.610 --> 10:53.610]  Oh, she has some energy.
[10:53.610 --> 10:54.610]  She definitely has some energy.
[10:54.610 --> 10:55.610]  Have you tried that magical slav?
[10:55.610 --> 10:56.610]  I have not tried it.
[10:56.610 --> 10:57.610]  That magical slave?
[10:57.610 --> 10:58.610]  Magical slav.
[10:58.610 --> 10:59.610]  That magical slav.
[10:59.610 --> 11:00.610]  Is she into BDSM, too?
[11:00.610 --> 11:03.610]  Granny's heating up an actor collector?
[11:03.610 --> 11:05.610]  Dude, she did work at that creepy-
[11:05.610 --> 11:07.610]  What is it?
[11:07.610 --> 11:08.610]  The adult arcade?
[11:08.610 --> 11:12.610]  Yeah, it's like a porn store and an arcade.
[11:12.610 --> 11:13.610]  We call that a shooting gallery?
[11:13.610 --> 11:14.610]  Yeah.
[11:14.610 --> 11:15.610]  Oh!
[11:15.610 --> 11:16.610]  Yeah, it's on Platte right by the black sheep.
[11:16.610 --> 11:17.610]  It's like the adult arcade.
[11:17.610 --> 11:18.610]  I like it.
[11:18.610 --> 11:19.610]  That's kind of gross.
[11:19.610 --> 11:20.610]  That was swift.
[11:20.610 --> 11:21.610]  That's kind of gross.
[11:21.610 --> 11:22.610]  I kind of wish I wouldn't have said that now.
[11:22.610 --> 11:24.610]  I call it a shooting gallery.
[11:24.610 --> 11:28.610]  I think that's hilarious.
[11:28.610 --> 11:30.610]  The look on Rebecca's face is priceless right now.
[11:30.610 --> 11:32.610]  We're all hilarious.
[11:32.610 --> 11:33.610]  All right, let's talk more about cannabis,
[11:33.610 --> 11:35.610]  because this got weird really quickly.
[11:35.610 --> 11:38.610]  Who here is not from Colorado?
[11:38.610 --> 11:40.610]  Yeah, me.
[11:40.610 --> 11:42.610]  Rebecca's the only one that's a Colorado native?
[11:42.610 --> 11:44.610]  Colorado native, born and raised.
[11:44.610 --> 11:45.610]  Nice, nice.
[11:45.610 --> 11:47.610]  I think, oh, Granny, you're from the corn, right?
[11:47.610 --> 11:48.610]  That's right, I'm an Iowa corn whore.
[11:48.610 --> 11:49.610]  She's an Iowa corn whore.
[11:49.610 --> 11:50.610]  You guys, she said corn whore.
[11:50.610 --> 11:53.610]  I just repeated it because she didn't have a microphone.
[11:53.610 --> 11:55.610]  These ladies are the best.
[11:55.610 --> 11:57.610]  Miss Dabigail, where are you from, honey?
[11:57.610 --> 11:58.610]  Chicago.
[11:58.610 --> 11:59.610]  Chicago?
[11:59.610 --> 12:00.610]  What brought you to Colorado?
[12:00.610 --> 12:02.610]  My sister was out here.
[12:02.610 --> 12:04.610]  Okay, did she come out for cannabis?
[12:04.610 --> 12:07.610]  No, we actually had never been here, and she loved it here.
[12:07.610 --> 12:08.610]  And then she left me here.
[12:08.610 --> 12:09.610]  She left you here?
[12:09.610 --> 12:10.610]  Now I'm here by myself.
[12:10.610 --> 12:11.610]  Oh, you're not alone.
[12:11.610 --> 12:12.610]  For your family.
[12:12.610 --> 12:15.610]  Yeah, I have the Elevate dolls taken over.
[12:15.610 --> 12:17.610]  And the whole cannabis community is your friend now.
[12:17.610 --> 12:19.610]  You've got so many followers on Instagram and Snapchat.
[12:19.610 --> 12:20.610]  You've got friends.
[12:20.610 --> 12:21.610]  Yes, I do.
[12:21.610 --> 12:22.610]  You're not alone.
[12:22.610 --> 12:23.610]  And don't you have a cool-ass dog?
[12:23.610 --> 12:25.610]  I have the best dog.
[12:25.610 --> 12:26.610]  Yeah, see, I pay attention.
[12:26.610 --> 12:27.610]  Shout-out to the dog.
[12:27.610 --> 12:31.610]  Abby, when I threw up that picture of you and I the other day,
[12:31.610 --> 12:34.610]  there was like, oh, Granny, I'm jealous.
[12:34.610 --> 12:36.610]  Did you see?
[12:36.610 --> 12:38.610]  Some guy was like, tell her she's hot.
[12:38.610 --> 12:41.610]  Yeah, there was a lot of comments about you, Miss Abby.
[12:41.610 --> 12:44.610]  Yeah, that picture got me a lot of attention.
[12:44.610 --> 12:45.610]  You made her blush, Granny.
[12:45.610 --> 12:47.610]  She's got a lot of followers.
[12:47.610 --> 12:48.610]  I did.
[12:48.610 --> 12:49.610]  She's a very beautiful young lady.
[12:49.610 --> 12:50.610]  A lot of followers.
[12:50.610 --> 12:52.610]  And she's as beautiful inside as she is out.
[12:52.610 --> 12:53.610]  Hell yeah.
[12:53.610 --> 12:54.610]  Second act.
[12:55.610 --> 12:58.610]  We just had a moment here in Elevate.
[12:58.610 --> 13:01.610]  Oh, yeah, we do have.
[13:01.610 --> 13:04.610]  Oh, they've all got the Elevate tattoo on the thumb.
[13:04.610 --> 13:05.610]  That's awesome.
[13:05.610 --> 13:06.610]  Thank you.
[13:06.610 --> 13:08.610]  You know, I've got to mention this since you're talking about the Elevate logo.
[13:08.610 --> 13:14.610]  These ladies were kind enough to gift me a dope new recycler, a new dab rig.
[13:14.610 --> 13:19.610]  The base has the Rasta-colored Elevate logo around it a few times.
[13:19.610 --> 13:23.610]  It's got the red, golden, green Elevate logo down the –
[13:23.610 --> 13:24.610]  What's this called?
[13:24.610 --> 13:25.610]  It's the recycler.
[13:25.610 --> 13:26.610]  The recycler part, right?
[13:26.610 --> 13:27.610]  What would you call that?
[13:27.610 --> 13:28.610]  Never mind.
[13:28.610 --> 13:30.610]  You guys are just as technical as I was going to be.
[13:30.610 --> 13:36.610]  The mouthpiece has the Elevate logo with the Colorado sea with the seed coming out of it.
[13:36.610 --> 13:42.610]  And then over here on the back kind of left side is a sprouting ganja seed.
[13:42.610 --> 13:43.610]  You guys, they kind of –
[13:43.610 --> 13:44.610]  Oh, I forgot the coolest part.
[13:44.610 --> 13:46.610]  Shit, I've got to keep spinning.
[13:46.610 --> 13:51.610]  Directly in front of me now, I'm looking at a Lion of Judah, a red, yellow, and green lion with some stars on it.
[13:51.610 --> 13:53.610]  It doesn't get any better than this.
[13:53.610 --> 13:55.610]  They made me a custom rig, you guys.
[13:55.610 --> 13:57.610]  So huge thanks to the people at Elevate.
[13:57.610 --> 13:58.610]  Thank you, ladies.
[13:58.610 --> 14:00.610]  You realize Becca did that.
[14:00.610 --> 14:02.610]  Did you assemble the glass also?
[14:02.610 --> 14:03.610]  No.
[14:03.610 --> 14:04.610]  Okay.
[14:04.610 --> 14:05.610]  I did not make the glass.
[14:05.610 --> 14:07.610]  But she did all the fancy work.
[14:07.610 --> 14:08.610]  Well, thank you.
[14:08.610 --> 14:09.610]  That's perfect.
[14:09.610 --> 14:11.610]  It was Silver Surfer Steve that blew the pipe, correct?
[14:11.610 --> 14:13.610]  Well, shout out to Silver Surfer Steve.
[14:13.610 --> 14:15.610]  Why do I have such a hard time with Silver Surfer?
[14:15.610 --> 14:16.610]  It's just two words.
[14:16.610 --> 14:18.610]  Silver Surfer Steve, thank you for the glass.
[14:18.610 --> 14:19.610]  It's super.
[14:19.610 --> 14:20.610]  I'm super excited.
[14:20.610 --> 14:21.610]  I'm excited to smoke through this.
[14:21.610 --> 14:23.610]  I think we're getting rude.
[14:23.610 --> 14:25.610]  But it was really funny.
[14:25.610 --> 14:29.610]  And super thank you for the perfect, perfect decals.
[14:29.610 --> 14:30.610]  I love it.
[14:30.610 --> 14:31.610]  It's great.
[14:31.610 --> 14:32.610]  I'll post pictures of you guys.
[14:32.610 --> 14:35.610]  Check it out on the ireegenetics Instagram, iree underscore genetics.
[14:35.610 --> 14:36.610]  Rusticquarian.
[14:36.610 --> 14:37.610]  Rustified.
[14:37.610 --> 14:39.610]  Yeah, it's super rustified.
[14:39.610 --> 14:41.610]  It is quite rustified.
[14:41.610 --> 14:43.610]  It is very growing from your heart, and I truly appreciate it.
[14:43.610 --> 14:44.610]  I've been taking dabs off of it.
[14:44.610 --> 14:47.610]  That's why I'm having a hard time speaking English today.
[14:47.610 --> 14:49.610]  Miss Lydia, let's get back to what we were talking about.
[14:49.610 --> 14:51.610]  Look, I found where we were.
[14:51.610 --> 14:53.610]  What brought you to Colorado, sweetheart?
[14:53.610 --> 14:56.610]  Well, my now fiance at the time, he was just my boyfriend.
[14:56.610 --> 15:00.610]  But he moved here, and yeah.
[15:00.610 --> 15:02.610]  Yeah, yeah, we got engaged in December.
[15:02.610 --> 15:03.610]  So it's been.
[15:03.610 --> 15:04.610]  Congrats.
[15:04.610 --> 15:05.610]  Thanks.
[15:05.610 --> 15:06.610]  When's that going to happen?
[15:06.610 --> 15:07.610]  We don't really know.
[15:07.610 --> 15:08.610]  We're not really on a rush.
[15:08.610 --> 15:09.610]  We don't really care.
[15:09.610 --> 15:10.610]  Kids are young.
[15:10.610 --> 15:11.610]  Have fun.
[15:11.610 --> 15:12.610]  It's good now.
[15:12.610 --> 15:13.610]  Right.
[15:13.610 --> 15:14.610]  We're going to throw a giant party.
[15:14.610 --> 15:15.610]  Hell yeah.
[15:15.610 --> 15:16.610]  That's all I was asking about.
[15:16.610 --> 15:17.610]  We're going to throw a giant party.
[15:17.610 --> 15:18.610]  Yeah, that's really what we want.
[15:18.610 --> 15:19.610]  We don't want to do any of that kind of stuff.
[15:19.610 --> 15:20.610]  We just want to.
[15:20.610 --> 15:21.610]  I don't know.
[15:21.610 --> 15:24.610]  We might just do it one day randomly, and then be like, hey, by the way, this happened.
[15:24.610 --> 15:27.610]  Let's hang out and take dabs about it.
[15:27.610 --> 15:28.610]  Take dabs about it.
[15:28.610 --> 15:29.610]  Yeah, take dabs about it.
[15:29.610 --> 15:30.610]  That's the best way to do it.
[15:30.610 --> 15:31.610]  Do you want to dab?
[15:31.610 --> 15:32.610]  I do.
[15:32.610 --> 15:33.610]  Do you want to dab?
[15:33.610 --> 15:34.610]  I do.
[15:34.610 --> 15:35.610]  High five.
[15:35.610 --> 15:36.610]  We're married.
[15:36.610 --> 15:37.610]  It's perfect.
[15:37.610 --> 15:38.610]  It's a great union.
[15:38.610 --> 15:39.610]  No, honestly, he's a really great guy.
[15:39.610 --> 15:40.610]  Becca's kicking off her shoes.
[15:40.610 --> 15:41.610]  We're getting cozy here in Elevate tonight.
[15:41.610 --> 15:42.610]  This is awesome.
[15:42.610 --> 15:43.610]  You're literally the only one with shoes on at this point.
[15:43.610 --> 15:44.610]  Oh, man, I'm just going to fall.
[15:44.610 --> 15:45.610]  What?
[15:45.610 --> 15:46.610]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[15:46.610 --> 15:47.610]  Those look like new shoes.
[15:47.610 --> 15:48.610]  These are pretty new.
[15:48.610 --> 15:49.610]  They're kind of snug.
[15:49.610 --> 15:50.610]  Oh, no, that's really great getting them off.
[15:50.610 --> 15:51.610]  Right on for the encouragement.
[15:51.610 --> 15:52.610]  Here, one more.
[15:52.610 --> 15:53.610]  Heck, yeah.
[15:53.610 --> 15:55.610]  Oh, now it's like an Elevate company slumber party now.
[15:55.610 --> 15:56.610]  We're just chilling.
[15:56.610 --> 15:57.610]  We're down for chilling.
[15:57.610 --> 16:02.610]  We have Hot Tub Time Machine on one of the TVs back here.
[16:02.610 --> 16:04.610]  And you've got a glass blowing video on the TV over here.
[16:04.610 --> 16:06.610]  I just now, how did I not notice that before?
[16:06.610 --> 16:08.610]  Hey, they're making what you got.
[16:08.610 --> 16:10.610]  That's the making of my piece basically right there.
[16:10.610 --> 16:11.610]  That is pretty rad.
[16:11.610 --> 16:14.610]  I have to look away because I could just stare into that all day.
[16:14.610 --> 16:16.610]  Yeah, and just keep watching and there won't be a podcast.
[16:16.610 --> 16:18.610]  Just be a narrative of me watching this guy blow glass.
[16:18.610 --> 16:23.610]  Granny, that dab of the orange stuff you gave me really got me super high.
[16:23.610 --> 16:24.610]  Thank you.
[16:24.610 --> 16:25.610]  I think Incredible Extracts is.
[16:25.610 --> 16:26.610]  Shout out to Incredible Extracts.
[16:26.610 --> 16:31.610]  I met Derek, the extract artist, at Secret Sesh.
[16:31.610 --> 16:32.610]  Oh, at the Secret Sesh.
[16:32.610 --> 16:33.610]  Yeah.
[16:33.610 --> 16:34.610]  He's tall like you.
[16:34.610 --> 16:35.610]  It's a secret.
[16:35.610 --> 16:36.610]  He's tall like you.
[16:36.610 --> 16:37.610]  He is super tall.
[16:37.610 --> 16:38.610]  He is very tall.
[16:38.610 --> 16:39.610]  He is.
[16:39.610 --> 16:40.610]  What's the height difference between you two?
[16:40.610 --> 16:42.610]  Because, I mean, you're both pretty tall.
[16:42.610 --> 16:43.610]  I am 6'5".
[16:43.610 --> 16:46.610]  I like to say 5'17 to confuse people.
[16:46.610 --> 16:47.610]  So he's about.
[16:47.610 --> 16:48.610]  Wow, you would be that kind of person.
[16:48.610 --> 16:49.610]  You wouldn't do that.
[16:49.610 --> 16:50.610]  You wouldn't.
[16:50.610 --> 16:52.610]  I'm literally not surprised at all.
[16:52.610 --> 16:53.610]  I would walk away.
[16:53.610 --> 16:55.610]  Yeah, that's too much math.
[16:55.610 --> 16:57.610]  I'm not signing up for that, dude.
[16:57.610 --> 16:58.610]  You're tall.
[16:58.610 --> 16:59.610]  That's it.
[16:59.610 --> 17:00.610]  5'17".
[17:00.610 --> 17:01.610]  I'm up here.
[17:01.610 --> 17:02.610]  Granny, how tall are you?
[17:02.610 --> 17:03.610]  5'10".
[17:03.610 --> 17:04.610]  5'11".
[17:04.610 --> 17:05.610]  Right in between.
[17:05.610 --> 17:06.610]  Man.
[17:06.610 --> 17:07.610]  5'2".
[17:07.610 --> 17:08.610]  Yeah.
[17:08.610 --> 17:09.610]  You're 5'2 over there, sweetie?
[17:09.610 --> 17:10.610]  We the 5'2 gang.
[17:10.610 --> 17:11.610]  5'2 gang?
[17:11.610 --> 17:12.610]  All right.
[17:12.610 --> 17:13.610]  I'm going to go with 5'7".
[17:13.610 --> 17:14.610]  Ha ha, she wins.
[17:14.610 --> 17:15.610]  Wow, okay.
[17:15.610 --> 17:16.610]  I don't know why.
[17:16.610 --> 17:17.610]  I don't know.
[17:17.610 --> 17:18.610]  I was like, what is she?
[17:18.610 --> 17:19.610]  What are we comparing?
[17:19.610 --> 17:20.610]  Becca always wins.
[17:20.610 --> 17:21.610]  She does.
[17:21.610 --> 17:24.610]  That's why she is Queen Becula.
[17:24.610 --> 17:25.610]  Man.
[17:25.610 --> 17:29.610]  I thought I was going to say something about her great breasts.
[17:29.610 --> 17:30.610]  I'm avoiding her great.
[17:30.610 --> 17:31.610]  I can't say anything about it.
[17:31.610 --> 17:32.610]  If I say it, it's creepy.
[17:32.610 --> 17:33.610]  If you say it, it's cute.
[17:33.610 --> 17:34.610]  I just have to.
[17:34.610 --> 17:35.610]  What?
[17:35.610 --> 17:36.610]  About your great breasts.
[17:36.610 --> 17:38.610]  I'll just make eye contact and behave myself.
[17:38.610 --> 17:39.610]  Man.
[17:39.610 --> 17:40.610]  This is funny.
[17:40.610 --> 17:41.610]  You're funny.
[17:41.610 --> 17:45.610]  You're going to hold the microphone next because it's my turn to take a dab.
[17:45.610 --> 17:46.610]  Uh oh.
[17:46.610 --> 17:47.610]  So tell us, you came here with your fiance?
[17:47.610 --> 17:48.610]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:48.610 --> 17:51.610]  Did you have a purpose when you headed out here or just new life?
[17:51.610 --> 17:56.610]  Well, actually, I got my degree in business management in Pennsylvania.
[17:56.610 --> 18:01.610]  And I had my cosmetology license, so I could move out here and do that if I wanted to.
[18:01.610 --> 18:05.610]  But low key, I worked in a head shop in the town that I lived in.
[18:05.610 --> 18:07.610]  And it wasn't super progressive at all.
[18:07.610 --> 18:10.610]  Like, the dude didn't want to carry like wax stuff.
[18:10.610 --> 18:12.610]  But he was a hippie.
[18:12.610 --> 18:14.610]  He was like a legitimate, like, from the beginning.
[18:14.610 --> 18:15.610]  Who was?
[18:15.610 --> 18:16.610]  My old boss in Pennsylvania.
[18:16.610 --> 18:18.610]  I was going to say not Adam.
[18:18.610 --> 18:19.610]  No, no, no.
[18:19.610 --> 18:20.610]  Not your fiance.
[18:20.610 --> 18:21.610]  Not my fiance.
[18:21.610 --> 18:22.610]  You're absolutely correct in that.
[18:22.610 --> 18:27.610]  But, yeah, anyways, it was a, it's what I really, I loved.
[18:27.610 --> 18:29.610]  It's what I was always a part of.
[18:29.610 --> 18:34.610]  So, yeah, when I came out here, I met Queen Rebecula.
[18:34.610 --> 18:37.610]  And my life has been this ever since.
[18:37.610 --> 18:38.610]  You guys make a great team.
[18:38.610 --> 18:39.610]  This is perfect.
[18:39.610 --> 18:43.610]  I like the way that you've set up the store and then the dolls and the way that the dolls rep the store perfectly.
[18:43.610 --> 18:45.610]  The way you guys do all the social media stuff.
[18:45.610 --> 18:46.610]  You're perfect.
[18:46.610 --> 18:47.610]  I couldn't do it without them.
[18:47.610 --> 18:48.610]  You're perfect.
[18:48.610 --> 18:49.610]  I got the best team.
[18:49.610 --> 18:54.610]  But, you know, we got to mention that there's also Higher Elevations that's part of this family.
[18:54.610 --> 18:55.610]  Yes.
[18:55.610 --> 18:56.610]  That's what actually started all of it.
[18:56.610 --> 19:03.610]  You know, before I came here, before I met Lydia, I did get a rig repaired at Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[19:03.610 --> 19:06.610]  I googled who can fix my glass on the Internet.
[19:06.610 --> 19:08.610]  And that's the first place that came up.
[19:08.610 --> 19:09.610]  And I drove there.
[19:09.610 --> 19:13.610]  And they told me I needed to make a deposit and drop off the rig.
[19:13.610 --> 19:16.610]  And if they fix my rig, they would charge me the other half of my payment.
[19:16.610 --> 19:20.610]  And if they didn't, they would give me a nice deal on a new purchase from the store.
[19:20.610 --> 19:22.610]  And I felt that that was super fair.
[19:22.610 --> 19:25.610]  And they called me in about 10 days and they said, hey, bro, come get your rig.
[19:25.610 --> 19:30.610]  And the rig is straighter now than it was when I got it from the original artist.
[19:30.610 --> 19:32.610]  We do tend to make glass look better.
[19:32.610 --> 19:33.610]  Yeah.
[19:33.610 --> 19:34.610]  Then it came in.
[19:34.610 --> 19:38.610]  You know, I don't like it when my dab nail points up at an angle because you're putting hash on there.
[19:38.610 --> 19:40.610]  It needs to stay straight because I put a lot of oil on a nail.
[19:40.610 --> 19:43.610]  And the amount of oil I put on there, if it's tilted at all, it will run off.
[19:43.610 --> 19:44.610]  So I need it straight up and down.
[19:44.610 --> 19:46.610]  And that rig was a little crooked before I broke it.
[19:46.610 --> 19:48.610]  And now it's perfectly straight up and down.
[19:48.610 --> 19:49.610]  My oil stays on there perfectly.
[19:49.610 --> 19:51.610]  So it was a good thing you broke it.
[19:51.610 --> 19:52.610]  Plus you found Higher Elevation.
[19:52.610 --> 19:53.610]  I did.
[19:53.610 --> 19:54.610]  It changed my life.
[19:54.610 --> 19:55.610]  So it was perfect.
[19:55.610 --> 19:56.610]  We wouldn't be sitting here right now if that didn't happen.
[19:56.610 --> 19:58.610]  So I guess that was a good thing.
[19:58.610 --> 19:59.610]  Yes.
[19:59.610 --> 20:00.610]  All right.
[20:00.610 --> 20:03.610]  Let's segue over to the event that Granny wanted to talk about.
[20:03.610 --> 20:05.610]  This is going to be a perfect time since Lydia is over here taking a dab.
[20:05.610 --> 20:07.610]  October 1st.
[20:07.610 --> 20:09.610]  That's a Saturday coming up.
[20:09.610 --> 20:10.610]  October 1st.
[20:10.610 --> 20:13.610]  This is really a great event.
[20:13.610 --> 20:16.610]  I'm really actually, Elevate is going to be part of this as well.
[20:16.610 --> 20:22.610]  But there's going to be, I'm going to kind of read off the flyer because I'm pretty impressed with this event.
[20:22.610 --> 20:27.610]  It's with DBK Glass.
[20:28.610 --> 20:33.610]  And right now they have 32 Colorado blowers that are going to be blowing glass that day.
[20:33.610 --> 20:37.610]  Then they're going to auction off those pipes.
[20:37.610 --> 20:45.610]  And all that money, all the proceeds are going to go to the Institute for Research on Cannabinoids.
[20:45.610 --> 20:47.610]  Did I get the accent on the right?
[20:47.610 --> 20:48.610]  You said it perfectly.
[20:48.610 --> 20:49.610]  Okay.
[20:49.610 --> 20:53.610]  And there's going to be a chili cook-off as well.
[20:53.610 --> 20:55.610]  So there's going to be people making chili.
[20:55.610 --> 20:57.610]  Some of it's going to be medicated.
[20:57.610 --> 20:59.610]  Some of it's going to be just regular chili.
[20:59.610 --> 21:06.610]  It's going to be from 930 to, I thought I saw a time.
[21:06.610 --> 21:11.610]  7 p.m. is when they're going to start judging the glass blowers.
[21:11.610 --> 21:17.610]  So each glass blower is going to be given an allotted amount of time to make a piece.
[21:17.610 --> 21:20.610]  And I'm telling you, there's like glass blowers.
[21:20.610 --> 21:24.610]  32 glass blowers that are all allowed a certain amount of time to make a piece.
[21:24.610 --> 21:29.610]  And then at the end, they're going to raffle that and give that money to cannabinoid research.
[21:29.610 --> 21:31.610]  That is awesome.
[21:31.610 --> 21:34.610]  I'm telling you, the glass blowers, it's amazing.
[21:34.610 --> 21:46.610]  It's Dr. Dabbs, Zombrie Glass, Wazoo Glass, Higher Elevated, Borrow Mojo, Rebels Glass, Slow Glass, the Glass Parrot.
[21:46.610 --> 21:50.610]  Our very own Silver Surfer Steve is going to be there.
[21:50.610 --> 21:51.610]  Dave the Slave.
[21:51.610 --> 21:53.610]  I think Matt's blowing.
[21:53.610 --> 21:58.610]  Pop D, Blazing Trees.
[21:58.610 --> 22:00.610]  Is our friend Chosen One going to be in there?
[22:00.610 --> 22:02.610]  Yes, he's going to be there.
[22:02.610 --> 22:03.610]  Shout out Chosen One.
[22:03.610 --> 22:04.610]  Pop D's going to be there.
[22:04.610 --> 22:07.610]  Josh Kabbler, Brown.
[22:07.610 --> 22:10.610]  I think Brent Thackeray's going to be there.
[22:10.610 --> 22:12.610]  There's going to be so many local glass blowers.
[22:12.610 --> 22:13.610]  And that's October 1st?
[22:13.610 --> 22:14.610]  Yep.
[22:14.610 --> 22:15.610]  What's the location?
[22:15.610 --> 22:17.610]  It's also SSV Steve's birthday that day.
[22:17.610 --> 22:20.610]  Silver Surfer Steve's birthday party also.
[22:20.610 --> 22:22.610]  Let's invade it and make it his birthday party, you guys.
[22:22.610 --> 22:23.610]  Party up.
[22:23.610 --> 22:24.610]  Bring him a dab.
[22:24.610 --> 22:25.610]  They don't know yet.
[22:25.610 --> 22:26.610]  They don't know yet?
[22:26.610 --> 22:27.610]  They do now.
[22:27.610 --> 22:28.610]  They're going to know Monday.
[22:28.610 --> 22:29.610]  They do now.
[22:29.610 --> 22:30.610]  Hey, everybody.
[22:30.610 --> 22:31.610]  Where is the location, Dab and Granny?
[22:31.610 --> 22:32.610]  The location is down.
[22:32.610 --> 22:34.610]  It's on El Paso.
[22:34.610 --> 22:35.610]  Yep.
[22:35.610 --> 22:38.610]  2833 North El Paso.
[22:38.610 --> 22:41.610]  Chef Brother Luck is going to be there.
[22:41.610 --> 22:43.610]  That's in Colorado Springs, right?
[22:43.610 --> 22:44.610]  Yep.
[22:44.610 --> 22:45.610]  Okay.
[22:45.610 --> 22:46.610]  Where is it at?
[22:46.610 --> 22:48.610]  Can you give them directions?
[22:48.610 --> 22:56.610]  Yeah, so like if you go Nevada to Fillmore, you're going to go right on Fillmore.
[22:56.610 --> 22:59.610]  And then El Paso is going to be on your left-hand side.
[22:59.610 --> 23:00.610]  Yes.
[23:00.610 --> 23:01.610]  Yep.
[23:01.610 --> 23:02.610]  Yeah.
[23:02.610 --> 23:03.610]  Kind of by the Jimmy Johns.
[23:03.610 --> 23:04.610]  DBK.
[23:04.610 --> 23:05.610]  Awesome.
[23:05.610 --> 23:09.610]  You know, it's going to be out in the parking lot.
[23:09.610 --> 23:10.610]  I'm just thrilled.
[23:10.610 --> 23:11.610]  You guys will see it.
[23:11.610 --> 23:12.610]  You will find it.
[23:12.610 --> 23:13.610]  If you drive to the right direction, you will find it.
[23:13.610 --> 23:14.610]  There's a good chance I'll be there.
[23:14.610 --> 23:16.610]  And the Great Southern food truck is going to be there.
[23:16.610 --> 23:18.610]  So there's going to be food as well.
[23:18.610 --> 23:20.610]  I think it's just going to be a great event.
[23:20.610 --> 23:24.610]  You know, I would say it's kind of like a cannabis family event because...
[23:24.610 --> 23:25.610]  It's going to be really fun.
[23:25.610 --> 23:27.610]  Live glassblowing is always fun to watch.
[23:27.610 --> 23:29.610]  Glassblowing is amazing.
[23:29.610 --> 23:30.610]  Isn't it?
[23:30.610 --> 23:31.610]  It's magical.
[23:31.610 --> 23:32.610]  If you've never seen anybody make glass, it's an amazing thing to see.
[23:32.610 --> 23:37.610]  They take a rod of solid glass and they turn it into something you can smoke through.
[23:37.610 --> 23:41.610]  In this room I'm sitting in, I can't even describe this properly.
[23:41.610 --> 23:45.610]  There are probably a hundred different styles of glass just within my view.
[23:45.610 --> 23:49.610]  I can tell a hundred different artists just twisted these up their way.
[23:49.610 --> 23:50.610]  Everybody's going to do it their way.
[23:50.610 --> 23:54.610]  It's amazing that everything in front of me started off as just a rod of clear glass.
[23:54.610 --> 23:57.610]  Then we have another event we want to talk about.
[23:57.610 --> 23:58.610]  Oh, shit.
[23:58.610 --> 23:59.610]  Uh-oh.
[23:59.610 --> 24:00.610]  Uh-oh.
[24:00.610 --> 24:01.610]  See, Jack is sitting up.
[24:01.610 --> 24:05.610]  I think October 22nd, there's something going on here in the Springs.
[24:05.610 --> 24:06.610]  Something.
[24:06.610 --> 24:07.610]  I heard about something.
[24:07.610 --> 24:10.610]  It's probably going to be the bee's knees.
[24:10.610 --> 24:11.610]  The bee's knees.
[24:11.610 --> 24:13.610]  Do they still say that?
[24:13.610 --> 24:14.610]  They do now.
[24:14.610 --> 24:15.610]  All right.
[24:15.610 --> 24:16.610]  We're bringing that back.
[24:16.610 --> 24:17.610]  We're bringing it back.
[24:17.610 --> 24:18.610]  We're bringing it back.
[24:18.610 --> 24:19.610]  Bee's knees.
[24:19.610 --> 24:20.610]  We're bringing back the bee's knees.
[24:20.610 --> 24:21.610]  The bee's knees.
[24:21.610 --> 24:22.610]  And we're going to party till the cows come home.
[24:22.610 --> 24:25.610]  She is a corn lady.
[24:25.610 --> 24:26.610]  All right.
[24:26.610 --> 24:27.610]  October 22nd.
[24:27.610 --> 24:28.610]  Yes.
[24:28.610 --> 24:34.610]  October 22nd at the Black Sheep, we're going to be having a Hetty Halloween party.
[24:34.610 --> 24:37.610]  We're going to have a costume contest.
[24:37.610 --> 24:39.610]  We're going to have a pumpkin carving contest.
[24:39.610 --> 24:41.610]  We're going to have a dab buzz.
[24:41.610 --> 24:43.610]  We're going to have dabbing fucking granny.
[24:43.610 --> 24:45.610]  Can I say it?
[24:45.610 --> 24:47.610]  You can say whatever the fuck you want on the show.
[24:47.610 --> 24:49.610]  You can say whatever the fuck you want.
[24:49.610 --> 24:50.610]  This is an adult show.
[24:50.610 --> 24:53.610]  We're going to have live glass blowing.
[24:53.610 --> 24:55.610]  We're going to have tons of decorations.
[24:55.610 --> 25:03.610]  We're going to have a photo booth, live music from Snow Lab, Groove On, the E.T.'s.
[25:03.610 --> 25:07.610]  About eight or nine locals are going to play.
[25:07.610 --> 25:09.610]  We're going to have a photo booth with props.
[25:09.610 --> 25:12.610]  We're going to be playing scary movies.
[25:12.610 --> 25:14.610]  Tickets are only $10.
[25:14.610 --> 25:16.610]  Now, Becca, where do they get those tickets?
[25:16.610 --> 25:22.610]  They can get the tickets at Elevate Glass Gallery, which is downtown on Tejon and Cimarron.
[25:22.610 --> 25:28.610]  Higher Elevations, which is Powers and Omaha, or at the Black Sheep itself.
[25:28.610 --> 25:29.610]  Nothing online?
[25:29.610 --> 25:30.610]  No.
[25:30.610 --> 25:33.610]  You can get it off the Black Sheep's website, I do believe.
[25:33.610 --> 25:34.610]  I bet you can.
[25:34.610 --> 25:35.610]  Yes.
[25:35.610 --> 25:36.610]  They do everything.
[25:37.610 --> 25:40.610]  So, guys, I will most likely be at the event October 22nd.
[25:40.610 --> 25:41.610]  Most likely.
[25:41.610 --> 25:43.610]  Well, they gave me a ticket, and they're staring at me like,
[25:43.610 --> 25:45.610]  you better be there or I'm going to burn you with a dab torch.
[25:45.610 --> 25:46.610]  So, guess what?
[25:46.610 --> 25:47.610]  Rasta Jeff will be there.
[25:47.610 --> 25:48.610]  We'll take dabs.
[25:48.610 --> 25:50.610]  I can't tell you what my costume will be because I may be in a costume.
[25:50.610 --> 25:51.610]  It'll be a good-ass time.
[25:51.610 --> 25:53.610]  Ooh, you're going to be incognito.
[25:53.610 --> 25:55.610]  How will we know it's you, Rasta Jeff?
[25:55.610 --> 25:59.610]  We're going to be giving away over $2,000 worth of stuff for these prizes, guys.
[25:59.610 --> 26:00.610]  Glass?
[26:00.610 --> 26:01.610]  Glass, yes.
[26:01.610 --> 26:03.610]  Ooh.
[26:03.610 --> 26:06.610]  Come dressed to impress.
[26:06.610 --> 26:09.610]  That's perfect, though.
[26:09.610 --> 26:12.610]  We're going to start a new dab band.
[26:12.610 --> 26:14.610]  That's the name of our band, just dab.
[26:14.610 --> 26:15.610]  Dab.
[26:15.610 --> 26:17.610]  October 22nd, you guys, at the Black Sheep.
[26:17.610 --> 26:18.610]  Come check it out.
[26:18.610 --> 26:19.610]  Take dabs with us.
[26:19.610 --> 26:21.610]  Lots of glass prizes.
[26:21.610 --> 26:24.610]  So, bring an extra backpack or something because you're going to win some glass.
[26:24.610 --> 26:25.610]  You're going to need to take home a piece.
[26:25.610 --> 26:27.610]  Like what kind of glass?
[26:27.610 --> 26:33.610]  SSV Steve is going to make a Halloween-themed piece for the grand prize.
[26:33.610 --> 26:36.610]  I'm trying to talk him into making like a pumpkin perk.
[26:36.610 --> 26:38.610]  With UV?
[26:38.610 --> 26:39.610]  Hashtag pumpkin perk.
[26:39.610 --> 26:40.610]  Yes, very UV.
[26:40.610 --> 26:41.610]  UV is very spooky.
[26:41.610 --> 26:42.610]  Yes.
[26:42.610 --> 26:43.610]  Yeah.
[26:43.610 --> 26:44.610]  And he's good at UV.
[26:44.610 --> 26:45.610]  Yeah.
[26:45.610 --> 26:47.610]  So, yeah, lots and lots of prizes.
[26:47.610 --> 26:48.610]  Probably some vaporizers.
[26:48.610 --> 26:51.610]  A lot of our listeners aren't in the dab scene.
[26:51.610 --> 26:52.610]  They're not from Colorado.
[26:52.610 --> 26:55.610]  They may be from Oklahoma or Australia or wherever.
[26:55.610 --> 26:58.610]  It's like you're driving to Colorado for Halloween.
[26:58.610 --> 27:03.610]  Well, I wanted to teach them about UV glass really quickly because UV is kind of the new shit.
[27:03.610 --> 27:05.610]  It's one of the newest things that's popping up on the glass scene right now.
[27:05.610 --> 27:06.610]  Illuminati.
[27:06.610 --> 27:07.610]  They're passing them.
[27:07.610 --> 27:13.610]  Granny's passing the mic over to Lydia because I think Lydia may be our UV expert might be what's happening here.
[27:13.610 --> 27:14.610]  Oh, no.
[27:14.610 --> 27:15.610]  Is that you?
[27:15.610 --> 27:16.610]  Is that you?
[27:16.610 --> 27:17.610]  You want to teach us about UV?
[27:17.610 --> 27:18.610]  No, she's just dabbing.
[27:18.610 --> 27:19.610]  She's totally the UV expert.
[27:19.610 --> 27:20.610]  I was hoping you were going to teach me about UV.
[27:20.610 --> 27:21.610]  I'm totally not the UV expert.
[27:21.610 --> 27:23.610]  So, UV, they put, I don't know what they put in the glass.
[27:23.610 --> 27:24.610]  It's radioactive salt.
[27:24.610 --> 27:25.610]  Okay, Becca knows.
[27:25.610 --> 27:26.610]  That they put in the glass.
[27:26.610 --> 27:27.610]  They put radioactive salt in the glass.
[27:27.610 --> 27:28.610]  Becca knows everything.
[27:28.610 --> 27:30.610]  And then they make a glass pipe with it.
[27:30.610 --> 27:33.610]  And then you turn on your black light and your glass glows.
[27:33.610 --> 27:34.610]  Glows.
[27:34.610 --> 27:35.610]  And it is crazy looking.
[27:35.610 --> 27:36.610]  It looks radioactive, you guys.
[27:36.610 --> 27:38.610]  It only glows under UV light, though.
[27:38.610 --> 27:41.610]  It will not glow in the dark.
[27:41.610 --> 27:42.610]  Only UV.
[27:42.610 --> 27:44.610]  Okay, that makes enough sense to me.
[27:44.610 --> 27:45.610]  I do have something to add, though.
[27:45.610 --> 27:46.610]  Let's hear it.
[27:46.610 --> 27:47.610]  Okay, so my.
[27:47.610 --> 27:48.610]  She's totally.
[27:48.610 --> 27:49.610]  No.
[27:49.610 --> 27:50.610]  Okay, no, that's not what I'm adding.
[27:51.610 --> 27:57.610]  My true obsession of UV is because I grew up in the 90s.
[27:57.610 --> 28:03.610]  And I did those damn fuzzy posters that glow under black light.
[28:03.610 --> 28:09.610]  And I had several black light accessories in my fucking awesome bedroom when I grew up.
[28:09.610 --> 28:10.610]  On a cul-de-sac.
[28:10.610 --> 28:12.610]  Did it look like Spencers threw up in your bedroom?
[28:12.610 --> 28:15.610]  No, I wasn't that, like, kind of douchey.
[28:16.610 --> 28:20.610]  I had, like, four lava lamps, and I really would like to start acquiring them.
[28:20.610 --> 28:21.610]  I still have a lava lamp, you know?
[28:21.610 --> 28:22.610]  That's really awesome.
[28:22.610 --> 28:24.610]  You do have a dabbing lava lamp.
[28:24.610 --> 28:25.610]  Granny's.
[28:25.610 --> 28:26.610]  Oh, you've got the dab.
[28:26.610 --> 28:27.610]  I've hit your dab lava lamp, Granny.
[28:27.610 --> 28:28.610]  Yes, I have.
[28:28.610 --> 28:29.610]  That is cute.
[28:29.610 --> 28:31.610]  Yeah, so that's why I like the UV glass.
[28:31.610 --> 28:35.610]  Because it's like an ode to the 90s, like, time that I grew up in.
[28:35.610 --> 28:37.610]  Because it's just, like, black light.
[28:37.610 --> 28:38.610]  And it's dope.
[28:38.610 --> 28:39.610]  And I'm smoking from it.
[28:39.610 --> 28:40.610]  It's getting really stoned.
[28:40.610 --> 28:43.610]  So it's, like, putting together a bunch of parts of, you know, the good stuff.
[28:43.610 --> 28:44.610]  It's awesome.
[28:44.610 --> 28:45.610]  It's nostalgia.
[28:45.610 --> 28:46.610]  Yeah, right?
[28:46.610 --> 28:48.610]  I know I'm still, like, a child.
[28:48.610 --> 28:49.610]  I understand that.
[28:49.610 --> 28:51.610]  I was just about to say, how old are you, and you're feeling nostalgia.
[28:51.610 --> 28:53.610]  Well, you know, I'm an old soul, Jeff.
[28:53.610 --> 28:54.610]  Okay?
[28:54.610 --> 28:55.610]  I'm 22, but.
[28:55.610 --> 28:57.610]  So, cannabis has brought.
[28:57.610 --> 29:01.610]  There's somebody from just about every generation in this room right now because of cannabis.
[29:01.610 --> 29:02.610]  22 years old.
[29:02.610 --> 29:03.610]  She's 22.
[29:03.610 --> 29:05.610]  But look at how smart she is.
[29:05.610 --> 29:06.610]  She's on the right track.
[29:06.610 --> 29:07.610]  Thanks, folks.
[29:07.610 --> 29:11.610]  I'm telling you, these young people just amaze me, don't they, you, Jeff?
[29:11.610 --> 29:13.610]  I mean, you're not as old as me, but.
[29:13.610 --> 29:15.610]  Shout out to Ross Cola, King Cola.
[29:15.610 --> 29:17.610]  Shout out to Barefoot Grower.
[29:17.610 --> 29:20.610]  Those guys are 10 years younger than me, and when I look at their grows.
[29:20.610 --> 29:22.610]  Shit, shout out to the Garden of Weeden.
[29:22.610 --> 29:23.610]  Those guys are 10 years younger than me.
[29:23.610 --> 29:26.610]  When I look at their stuff, I'm like, holy shit, those guys are killing it.
[29:26.610 --> 29:32.610]  And then they work with these young extraction artists up in the canyon up there and the medicine they make.
[29:32.610 --> 29:33.610]  Yes.
[29:33.610 --> 29:36.610]  You know, like I say, this Incredibles is good stuff.
[29:36.610 --> 29:40.610]  You buy that medicine from the homies.
[29:40.610 --> 29:42.610]  That is really good medicine.
[29:42.610 --> 29:45.610]  The Incredibles is made by somebody younger than me.
[29:45.610 --> 29:46.610]  Really?
[29:46.610 --> 29:47.610]  Yeah, that guy's younger than me.
[29:47.610 --> 29:50.610]  I'm certain that Dee is a few years younger than me.
[29:50.610 --> 29:57.610]  Well, they're very proud of their grow because any product you and I both know comes from the grow, and they have a good product.
[29:57.610 --> 29:59.610]  That orange soda is tasty.
[29:59.610 --> 30:00.610]  You see how clean it is?
[30:00.610 --> 30:02.610]  The frozen monkey, any of their rosin.
[30:02.610 --> 30:03.610]  The frozen monkey?
[30:03.610 --> 30:04.610]  I think it's funky monkey.
[30:04.610 --> 30:06.610]  No, it's fresh frozen monkey.
[30:06.610 --> 30:09.610]  Okay, that makes more sense to me than frozen.
[30:09.610 --> 30:11.610]  And then we've got the Sour Band.
[30:11.610 --> 30:19.610]  Do you want to talk a little bit about fresh frozen and the difference between the frozen and the not frozen since Becca had a couple of questions about it and these ladies had questions earlier?
[30:19.610 --> 30:26.610]  Well, you being the big expert, I love to dab, but I'm getting to know the difference in the products I like.
[30:26.610 --> 30:33.610]  And it really seems like this fresh frozen keeps the turps in as we've talked about before.
[30:33.610 --> 30:35.610]  We don't have any of our turp men here tonight.
[30:35.610 --> 30:39.610]  The main difference is we're cutting down the plants while they're still alive.
[30:39.610 --> 30:46.610]  We cut them down, trim them up just a little bit, take off the big leaves, throw those in a freezer, and freeze them up completely.
[30:46.610 --> 30:48.610]  I'm going to tell the whole world what you just did.
[30:48.610 --> 30:54.610]  All right, so we freeze the plants completely, and then we put the frozen material into the extraction tubes and extract it with the butane.
[30:54.610 --> 30:56.610]  Then it goes into the vac oven.
[30:56.610 --> 30:58.610]  Then it's properly purged.
[30:58.610 --> 31:01.610]  That's the main difference is that before we were letting the herb dry.
[31:01.610 --> 31:02.610]  Yep, hanging the plants to dry.
[31:02.610 --> 31:06.610]  I think that the frozen, we are certainly getting more turps, and that's what we're calling live resin.
[31:06.610 --> 31:08.610]  We're getting way more turps, way more flavor.
[31:08.610 --> 31:12.610]  It's definitely a more presentable product.
[31:12.610 --> 31:16.610]  It's probably the top of the concentrates right now.
[31:16.610 --> 31:18.610]  That, the distillate, and the turps.
[31:18.610 --> 31:20.610]  Mm, distillates and turps.
[31:20.610 --> 31:24.610]  It kind of depends on where you are and what you're looking for, but yeah, the live resin, the distillate, and the turps.
[31:24.610 --> 31:28.610]  I'm a shatter guy myself because I like to take giant dabs of shatter.
[31:28.610 --> 31:29.610]  Me too, me too.
[31:29.610 --> 31:30.610]  I've seen you take some pretty big globs.
[31:30.610 --> 31:32.610]  When you get this sappy stuff, you need a shovel.
[31:32.610 --> 31:36.610]  You need one of those skillet shovel tools.
[31:36.610 --> 31:37.610]  Like a honey wand almost.
[31:37.610 --> 31:38.610]  Yeah.
[31:38.610 --> 31:39.610]  It's so sappy and gooey.
[31:39.610 --> 31:40.610]  Usually that's the CBD stuff.
[31:40.610 --> 31:42.610]  The CBD makes it really, really runny.
[31:42.610 --> 31:44.610]  Well, that orange soda is pretty sappy.
[31:44.610 --> 31:45.610]  That stuff tastes so good.
[31:45.610 --> 31:46.610]  Yes.
[31:46.610 --> 31:47.610]  So good.
[31:47.610 --> 31:48.610]  Yeah, you can smell it.
[31:48.610 --> 31:50.610]  How many times have you dabbed?
[31:50.610 --> 31:52.610]  I hear you only dab occasionally.
[31:52.610 --> 31:53.610]  Oh, she got mics for every direction.
[31:53.610 --> 31:55.610]  Oh, mics for days.
[31:55.610 --> 31:57.610]  We got mic-rich titties.
[31:57.610 --> 31:59.610]  Ooh.
[31:59.610 --> 32:00.610]  She's in stereo, you guys.
[32:00.610 --> 32:02.610]  She's got a mic in each hand.
[32:02.610 --> 32:04.610]  Becca's on some dabs right now.
[32:04.610 --> 32:05.610]  She's double fisting.
[32:05.610 --> 32:06.610]  Yeah, she's definitely catching a buzz from us.
[32:06.610 --> 32:07.610]  She's double fisting.
[32:07.610 --> 32:08.610]  It's where I'm hitting with part of this.
[32:08.610 --> 32:15.610]  I've dabbed once in my entire life, and that was out of a 12-foot dab straw with dabbing
[32:15.610 --> 32:18.610]  Granny at one of my parties.
[32:18.610 --> 32:20.610]  That was your only dab ever?
[32:20.610 --> 32:21.610]  Pretty much, yeah.
[32:21.610 --> 32:25.610]  Granny, did you know that that was her first dab ever?
[32:25.610 --> 32:27.610]  I did not.
[32:27.610 --> 32:33.610]  And because Becca is my friend, I thought I should turn her on to some good medicine
[32:33.610 --> 32:35.610]  like the orange soda.
[32:35.610 --> 32:36.610]  Oh, man.
[32:36.610 --> 32:38.610]  Probably about a third of a gram.
[32:38.610 --> 32:41.610]  Oh, that's like a my size dab.
[32:41.610 --> 32:43.610]  Yeah, I was pretty fucked up.
[32:43.610 --> 32:44.610]  Did you take a nap?
[32:44.610 --> 32:49.610]  I went and hid for like two hours.
[32:49.610 --> 32:51.610]  Incognito.
[32:51.610 --> 32:56.610]  And then I came back out, and I was super fucking high for the next 48 hours.
[32:56.610 --> 32:57.610]  Wow.
[32:57.610 --> 33:03.610]  And we did like three shots of Patron, and we drank some beer.
[33:03.610 --> 33:04.610]  Yeah.
[33:04.610 --> 33:06.610]  It's good to be the boss, right?
[33:06.610 --> 33:07.610]  Yes.
[33:07.610 --> 33:08.610]  Damn.
[33:08.610 --> 33:10.610]  Well, I'm pretty sure you caught a nice little buzz hanging out with us tonight.
[33:10.610 --> 33:11.610]  That's why I'm just hitting with all that.
[33:11.610 --> 33:12.610]  Granny's always a good time.
[33:12.610 --> 33:13.610]  Granny's always a good time.
[33:13.610 --> 33:14.610]  I've never had a bad time with Granny.
[33:14.610 --> 33:15.610]  Never.
[33:15.610 --> 33:17.610]  Even the podcast that didn't work was a good time.
[33:17.610 --> 33:18.610]  Yes.
[33:18.610 --> 33:19.610]  We love Granny.
[33:19.610 --> 33:20.610]  Miss Dab-a-Gail over there.
[33:20.610 --> 33:21.610]  Yes.
[33:21.610 --> 33:22.610]  What's your favorite stuff to dab?
[33:23.610 --> 33:26.610]  I do like some live resin or some sugar.
[33:26.610 --> 33:27.610]  Some sugar.
[33:27.610 --> 33:28.610]  Yes.
[33:28.610 --> 33:29.610]  So we got to explain that now.
[33:29.610 --> 33:32.610]  Some live resin will sugar up sometimes.
[33:32.610 --> 33:33.610]  It'll get...
[33:33.610 --> 33:34.610]  It looks grainy.
[33:34.610 --> 33:37.610]  It looks real like sugar granules, like golden honey sugar granules.
[33:37.610 --> 33:41.610]  I find that to have a lot of flavor most of the time.
[33:41.610 --> 33:42.610]  Yeah.
[33:42.610 --> 33:46.610]  I'm not really sure how it's made exactly, but I do appreciate it a lot.
[33:46.610 --> 33:47.610]  Do you like big dabs or little dabs?
[33:47.610 --> 33:48.610]  I like big dabs.
[33:48.610 --> 33:49.610]  How big?
[33:49.610 --> 33:50.610]  Oh.
[33:50.610 --> 33:51.610]  Like 0.3?
[33:51.610 --> 33:52.610]  0.2?
[33:52.610 --> 33:53.610]  Yeah, like 0.3.
[33:53.610 --> 33:54.610]  0.4.
[33:54.610 --> 33:55.610]  0.4.
[33:55.610 --> 33:56.610]  Oh, she's stepping up.
[33:56.610 --> 33:57.610]  0.4.
[33:57.610 --> 33:58.610]  Oh.
[33:58.610 --> 33:59.610]  Half gram dabs.
[33:59.610 --> 34:00.610]  Let's do it.
[34:00.610 --> 34:01.610]  Let's get a half gram dab going.
[34:01.610 --> 34:02.610]  Bumper dabs draw.
[34:02.610 --> 34:03.610]  Let's do it.
[34:03.610 --> 34:04.610]  For your birthday.
[34:04.610 --> 34:05.610]  Yes.
[34:05.610 --> 34:06.610]  Oh, uh-oh.
[34:06.610 --> 34:07.610]  Is it your birthday?
[34:07.610 --> 34:08.610]  My birthday is on Friday.
[34:08.610 --> 34:09.610]  On Friday.
[34:09.610 --> 34:10.610]  Uh-oh.
[34:10.610 --> 34:13.610]  We're going to have to come do lots of dabs for Dab-a-Gail's birthday.
[34:13.610 --> 34:15.610]  Everybody wish her happy birthday on Twitter and Instagram.
[34:15.610 --> 34:17.610]  She already shouted out her stuff earlier at the start of the show,
[34:17.610 --> 34:19.610]  so make sure you tell this young lady happy birthday.
[34:19.610 --> 34:24.610]  This podcast won't come out until Monday, but you can retroactively wish her a late birthday.
[34:24.610 --> 34:25.610]  Thanks.
[34:25.610 --> 34:26.610]  All right, let's get some dabs going then.
[34:26.610 --> 34:28.610]  You want to do a half gram dab?
[34:28.610 --> 34:30.610]  I got my hands full, but I'm going to make it happen.
[34:30.610 --> 34:31.610]  I got the tool out.
[34:31.610 --> 34:32.610]  Miss.
[34:32.610 --> 34:33.610]  Oh, oh, oh.
[34:33.610 --> 34:34.610]  That wasn't as bad as it sounded, you guys.
[34:34.610 --> 34:36.610]  That all came through on the microphones.
[34:36.610 --> 34:37.610]  That was just a dabber.
[34:37.610 --> 34:38.610]  It was cool.
[34:38.610 --> 34:39.610]  Nothing broke.
[34:39.610 --> 34:40.610]  And luckily, you know, we know a few glass blowers.
[34:40.610 --> 34:41.610]  We do.
[34:41.610 --> 34:42.610]  And if things get broken, I know where to take it.
[34:42.610 --> 34:43.610]  It's no big deal.
[34:43.610 --> 34:46.610]  I'm going to tell you yesterday what I did.
[34:46.610 --> 34:52.610]  I had the privilege of hanging out with our mutual friend, Ross DeGeoff, THC Sam.
[34:52.610 --> 34:54.610]  And we went up to Denver.
[34:54.610 --> 34:55.610]  Sam is a great dude.
[34:55.610 --> 34:57.610]  He is a great dude.
[34:57.610 --> 35:03.610]  And his friend, Josh, who they went to college together, he came with us.
[35:03.610 --> 35:10.610]  But we went to Denver, and I went to a few new dispensaries up there that I'd never been to before, and that was fun.
[35:10.610 --> 35:15.610]  And then I went to THC Magazine, the office.
[35:15.610 --> 35:18.610]  I really feel like I need to narrate this dab for Dabigail.
[35:18.610 --> 35:22.610]  Because, dude, she is going to be wrecked.
[35:22.610 --> 35:24.610]  So Sam and I are going to start something up there.
[35:24.610 --> 35:29.610]  We're going to be doing either a podcast or a broadcast reviewing glass and pots.
[35:29.610 --> 35:31.610]  She said she's excited, but she really doesn't know what she's doing.
[35:31.610 --> 35:32.610]  Let's be real.
[35:32.610 --> 35:36.610]  All right, Granny, this young lady is about to take a .3, maybe a .4 over there.
[35:36.610 --> 35:37.610]  Holy.
[35:37.610 --> 35:39.610]  Okay, so it's about a .4 is what Jess said.
[35:39.610 --> 35:41.610]  This is a pre-birthday dab for Ms. Dabigail.
[35:41.610 --> 35:43.610]  I'm causing pain to Dabigail already.
[35:43.610 --> 35:44.610]  Oh, my gosh.
[35:44.610 --> 35:45.610]  Go ahead, Lydia.
[35:45.610 --> 35:46.610]  I will let you narrate.
[35:46.610 --> 35:47.610]  You're good at this.
[35:47.610 --> 35:52.610]  Well, just because I know Dabigail, so this is pretty intense.
[35:52.610 --> 35:53.610]  Is that a big one for her?
[35:53.610 --> 35:54.610]  Oh, my God, it's huge.
[35:54.610 --> 35:55.610]  She's dropping it in the nail.
[35:55.610 --> 35:56.610]  She is.
[35:56.610 --> 35:57.610]  I mean, it's doing good.
[35:57.610 --> 36:00.610]  She's like puddling, and it's a lot of delicious low-temp lean.
[36:00.610 --> 36:04.610]  She's hitting the Rasta-themed elevate recycler.
[36:04.610 --> 36:07.610]  Nobody make her laugh, because, yeah, holy cow.
[36:07.610 --> 36:08.610]  She's got the carb cap on.
[36:08.610 --> 36:09.610]  I think she did it.
[36:09.610 --> 36:10.610]  I'm going to call that a success.
[36:10.610 --> 36:11.610]  She totally did it.
[36:11.610 --> 36:12.610]  Oh, it's without a doubt a success.
[36:12.610 --> 36:13.610]  No cough.
[36:13.610 --> 36:14.610]  She's a pro.
[36:14.610 --> 36:17.610]  Out of a 10, I give you an 11.
[36:17.610 --> 36:19.610]  Yes, she didn't change any colors.
[36:19.610 --> 36:20.610]  That amount of coughing is acceptable.
[36:20.610 --> 36:22.610]  Yeah, totally, for sure.
[36:22.610 --> 36:23.610]  I would be dying.
[36:23.610 --> 36:27.610]  There is no way Becca does not have a contact high.
[36:27.610 --> 36:30.610]  I just smelt that dab all the way over here.
[36:30.610 --> 36:34.610]  That was actually the Pineapple Jack Nug Run Shatter from Turpex.
[36:34.610 --> 36:35.610]  Shout-out to Turpex.
[36:35.610 --> 36:37.610]  I picked that up over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[36:37.610 --> 36:39.610]  Shout-out to my friends at Green and Healthy.
[36:39.610 --> 36:40.610]  What's up, Lindsay?
[36:40.610 --> 36:42.610]  I hope you're having a great shift if you're listening to this at work.
[36:42.610 --> 36:43.610]  Hi, Lindsay.
[36:43.610 --> 36:46.610]  Shout-out to Lindsay, the Traveling Stoner.
[36:46.610 --> 36:47.610]  Always a shout-out to Lindsay.
[36:47.610 --> 36:49.610]  The podcast is not the same without her.
[36:49.610 --> 36:50.610]  Oh, my gosh.
[36:50.610 --> 36:52.610]  She came in here and got rollers.
[36:52.610 --> 36:54.610]  And she was one of the most delightful people.
[36:54.610 --> 37:00.610]  And we talked about how she hung out with you at the Secrets.
[37:00.610 --> 37:02.610]  Shh.
[37:02.610 --> 37:06.610]  But anyways, she is really, really delightful.
[37:06.610 --> 37:09.610]  So, it was actually a really funny story.
[37:09.610 --> 37:13.610]  I couldn't find the roller that was literally right in front of my face.
[37:13.610 --> 37:15.610]  And I wasn't stoned or anything.
[37:15.610 --> 37:16.610]  That's your style.
[37:16.610 --> 37:17.610]  Yeah.
[37:17.610 --> 37:18.610]  I know.
[37:18.610 --> 37:20.610]  I don't really ask for forgiveness for it.
[37:20.610 --> 37:21.610]  But, yeah.
[37:21.610 --> 37:23.610]  But the thing is I wasn't even really stoned.
[37:23.610 --> 37:25.610]  Like, I have a max capacity of stoned.
[37:25.610 --> 37:26.610]  And I was not at it.
[37:26.610 --> 37:28.610]  And, yeah.
[37:28.610 --> 37:30.610]  She was really, really delightful.
[37:30.610 --> 37:31.610]  Really delightful.
[37:31.610 --> 37:32.610]  Lindsay is one of my best friends.
[37:32.610 --> 37:33.610]  You have a good best friend.
[37:33.610 --> 37:34.610]  Yeah.
[37:34.610 --> 37:35.610]  Yeah.
[37:35.610 --> 37:36.610]  It's one of my favorite people on the planet.
[37:36.610 --> 37:37.610]  Shout-out to Lindsay.
[37:37.610 --> 37:38.610]  Shout-out to Bobo Blaster.
[37:38.610 --> 37:39.610]  And, yeah.
[37:39.610 --> 37:41.610]  I'm going to get back to the ice cream incident that I saw happen over here.
[37:41.610 --> 37:43.610]  What are you guys doing to my microphone?
[37:43.610 --> 37:45.610]  We literally were.
[37:45.610 --> 37:47.610]  Don't disrespect my microphone like that, ladies.
[37:47.610 --> 37:49.610]  I'm going to have to sanitize everything.
[37:49.610 --> 37:50.610]  We totally didn't lick it.
[37:50.610 --> 37:51.610]  I didn't touch it with my tongue.
[37:51.610 --> 37:53.610]  I made it more valuable, okay?
[37:53.610 --> 37:54.610]  Yeah, no.
[37:54.610 --> 37:55.610]  I was just.
[37:55.610 --> 37:56.610]  Becca said they made it more valuable.
[37:56.610 --> 37:58.610]  They increased the value of it's christened.
[37:58.610 --> 38:00.610]  Yeah, with our presence.
[38:00.610 --> 38:02.610]  With our presence.
[38:02.610 --> 38:04.610]  Our close proximity.
[38:04.610 --> 38:06.610]  You are so lucky you didn't go to high school together.
[38:06.610 --> 38:07.610]  Yes.
[38:07.610 --> 38:08.610]  We probably are.
[38:08.610 --> 38:09.610]  That's very true.
[38:09.610 --> 38:10.610]  Yeah, we probably are.
[38:10.610 --> 38:12.610]  That would have been troublesome.
[38:12.610 --> 38:14.610]  We were talking about us in high school, actually, the other day.
[38:14.610 --> 38:15.610]  We very much were.
[38:15.610 --> 38:18.610]  And Lydia, sometimes I tend to have to explain things to her like.
[38:18.610 --> 38:19.610]  Oh, fuck you.
[38:19.610 --> 38:20.610]  Trap house and.
[38:20.610 --> 38:21.610]  What was the other one?
[38:21.610 --> 38:22.610]  Lean?
[38:22.610 --> 38:23.610]  Okay, yeah.
[38:23.610 --> 38:26.610]  And we started talking about house parties.
[38:26.610 --> 38:28.610]  She was like, house party?
[38:28.610 --> 38:32.610]  Well, okay, because somebody used it as a form of measurement.
[38:32.610 --> 38:36.610]  Like, I was like, oh, how many people were there?
[38:36.610 --> 38:38.610]  And she was like, oh, well, it was like a house party.
[38:38.610 --> 38:42.610]  And I was like, I don't know what that means still.
[38:42.610 --> 38:44.610]  And Dabby Ann was like, oh, yeah, okay.
[38:44.610 --> 38:46.610]  And I'm like, wait, what?
[38:46.610 --> 38:47.610]  Like, how does that make sense to you?
[38:47.610 --> 38:51.610]  It's one, the size of groups smaller than the black sheep.
[38:51.610 --> 38:52.610]  Yeah.
[38:52.610 --> 38:54.610]  See, everybody understood that reference.
[38:54.610 --> 38:55.610]  No, no, no.
[38:55.610 --> 38:57.610]  What if you have a small house?
[38:57.610 --> 39:00.610]  What if you live in one of them damn tiny houses?
[39:00.610 --> 39:01.610]  Well, we're all coming over anyway.
[39:01.610 --> 39:03.610]  Your house party is different than.
[39:03.610 --> 39:04.610]  A family party.
[39:04.610 --> 39:11.610]  That's where it came because my brother had fit 74 people into like a bottom section of a house.
[39:11.610 --> 39:13.610]  And my mom didn't wake up the whole time.
[39:13.610 --> 39:15.610]  And there were 74 people in the basement.
[39:15.610 --> 39:17.610]  What did they give your mother?
[39:17.610 --> 39:25.610]  She had just gotten her top teeth taken out and got dentures put in.
[39:25.610 --> 39:26.610]  She was done for the night.
[39:26.610 --> 39:28.610]  Four days, she was done.
[39:28.610 --> 39:29.610]  Wow.
[39:29.610 --> 39:30.610]  I'll take two.
[39:30.610 --> 39:31.610]  So house parties.
[39:31.610 --> 39:32.610]  I'll take two.
[39:32.610 --> 39:38.610]  Speaking of being out for four days, let's just shout out to Max at TNT Instructions.
[39:38.610 --> 39:39.610]  Did he get you, granny?
[39:39.610 --> 39:40.610]  Yeah.
[39:40.610 --> 39:48.610]  His bacon, I'm sorry, Jeff, I know you're a vegetarian, so you wouldn't know, but his bacon is the shit.
[39:48.610 --> 39:50.610]  You know, he gives me bacon every time I see him.
[39:50.610 --> 39:51.610]  Not anymore.
[39:51.610 --> 39:52.610]  And I remind him that I'm a vegetarian.
[39:52.610 --> 39:53.610]  Yeah.
[39:53.610 --> 39:54.610]  Now he gives me dabs.
[39:54.610 --> 39:55.610]  He's like, here, bro, sorry.
[39:55.610 --> 39:57.610]  Sorry about all the bacon I've given you.
[39:57.610 --> 39:58.610]  He's a nice guy.
[39:58.610 --> 40:01.610]  I just met him a few weeks ago was the first time I met him.
[40:01.610 --> 40:05.610]  He gave me two separate 1000 milligram edibles.
[40:05.610 --> 40:10.610]  And I'm not sure if I wanted to be his friend after I ate the first one.
[40:10.610 --> 40:12.610]  That made my life difficult.
[40:12.610 --> 40:13.610]  Oh my God.
[40:13.610 --> 40:17.610]  A thousand milligrams is like, I described it as putting ankle weights on your brain.
[40:17.610 --> 40:20.610]  It was a challenge all day long and the next day as well.
[40:20.610 --> 40:25.610]  It took me three days because I ate six pieces of that bacon.
[40:25.610 --> 40:31.610]  And then two of those cookies from that guy that was standing there, 450 milligram cookies.
[40:31.610 --> 40:32.610]  Each?
[40:32.610 --> 40:33.610]  Each.
[40:33.610 --> 40:34.610]  Oh, you were flying, granny.
[40:34.610 --> 40:35.610]  Yeah.
[40:35.610 --> 40:36.610]  You were sedated.
[40:36.610 --> 40:38.610]  I took my husband to the military doctor.
[40:38.610 --> 40:40.610]  He was like, what's wrong with you, Gail?
[40:40.610 --> 40:42.610]  Why are you so sluggish?
[40:42.610 --> 40:43.610]  I know I'm so tired.
[40:43.610 --> 40:45.610]  And I really didn't know.
[40:45.610 --> 40:50.610]  And then by the end of the week, I was like, I know what was wrong with me.
[40:50.610 --> 40:53.610]  I ate way too many edibles.
[40:53.610 --> 40:56.610]  I have to tell you a funny story about the military hospital.
[40:56.610 --> 41:01.610]  We were there Monday.
[41:01.610 --> 41:04.610]  And we were walking to the elevator.
[41:04.610 --> 41:15.610]  And a little soldier in uniform, he must have been about 25, came running up to me and said, I know you.
[41:15.610 --> 41:17.610]  And I said, oh, you do?
[41:17.610 --> 41:19.610]  And he said, yeah, let's get in the elevator though.
[41:20.610 --> 41:23.610]  And as soon as we got in the elevator, he said, can I have my picture with you now?
[41:23.610 --> 41:24.610]  That is cool.
[41:24.610 --> 41:25.610]  Yes.
[41:25.610 --> 41:26.610]  You know, we haven't taken a selfie, granny.
[41:26.610 --> 41:27.610]  We're going to have to do that before we leave here.
[41:27.610 --> 41:29.610]  Yeah, we're definitely going to have to.
[41:29.610 --> 41:31.610]  I noticed that we've hung out like three or four times now.
[41:31.610 --> 41:32.610]  There's no selfie of us.
[41:32.610 --> 41:33.610]  That's because we always enjoy each other's company.
[41:33.610 --> 41:34.610]  That's the truth.
[41:34.610 --> 41:35.610]  We don't think about getting the phones out.
[41:35.610 --> 41:37.610]  Put our phones away and have a good time.
[41:37.610 --> 41:40.610]  If you take a selfie with Rasta Jeff, is that called a Jeffy?
[41:40.610 --> 41:41.610]  That's what I've always wondered.
[41:41.610 --> 41:42.610]  I think it is.
[41:42.610 --> 41:45.610]  If you take a selfie on a rooftop, is that called a roofie?
[41:45.610 --> 41:47.610]  Yes.
[41:47.610 --> 41:49.610]  That's not my joke, but it's funny either way.
[41:49.610 --> 41:50.610]  What happened to Lydia?
[41:50.610 --> 41:51.610]  Where did she go?
[41:51.610 --> 41:52.610]  To the bathroom.
[41:52.610 --> 41:53.610]  Come on, Lydia.
[41:53.610 --> 41:54.610]  You couldn't wait?
[41:54.610 --> 41:55.610]  You don't have podcaster bladder?
[41:55.610 --> 41:56.610]  Podcaster bladder?
[41:56.610 --> 41:57.610]  No.
[41:57.610 --> 41:58.610]  That's a special thing.
[41:58.610 --> 41:59.610]  She don't.
[41:59.610 --> 42:00.610]  It's like truck driver bladder.
[42:00.610 --> 42:01.610]  This is her first podcast.
[42:01.610 --> 42:03.610]  Well, you guys are wonderful on a podcast.
[42:03.610 --> 42:04.610]  How about you?
[42:04.610 --> 42:05.610]  Yeah, same.
[42:05.610 --> 42:06.610]  Same.
[42:06.610 --> 42:07.610]  It's fun, isn't it?
[42:07.610 --> 42:09.610]  Well, I hope you guys are back on another podcast.
[42:09.610 --> 42:11.610]  We hope to be on another podcast.
[42:11.610 --> 42:15.610]  If my equipment learns to behave itself, maybe I can record a little bit from the event on
[42:15.610 --> 42:17.610]  October 22nd at the Black Sheep.
[42:17.610 --> 42:19.610]  Yes, that would be awesome.
[42:19.610 --> 42:20.610]  All right.
[42:20.610 --> 42:21.610]  I'll try to bring this little recorder.
[42:21.610 --> 42:24.610]  I'll get it fixed because everybody that listens to the show knows that this thing gave us some issues,
[42:24.610 --> 42:26.610]  and I don't trust it.
[42:26.610 --> 42:27.610]  I'll get it fixed.
[42:27.610 --> 42:28.610]  I'll bring it to the one on the 22nd.
[42:28.610 --> 42:30.610]  I'll bring one or two microphones.
[42:30.610 --> 42:32.610]  We'll talk about the event live from the place while we're there.
[42:32.610 --> 42:35.610]  Are you cold?
[42:35.610 --> 42:36.610]  I'm freezing.
[42:36.610 --> 42:37.610]  You're freezing?
[42:37.610 --> 42:44.610]  I had to turn the air on to get the cloud of dabs moving.
[42:45.610 --> 42:52.610]  I was trying to think of a tactful way to say that without busting you out on having the front of the store nice and cloudy.
[42:52.610 --> 42:54.610]  I think it is you and me.
[42:54.610 --> 42:55.610]  Shout out to the pizza guy.
[42:55.610 --> 42:59.610]  The last time we hung out together, they had to open the back door.
[42:59.610 --> 43:01.610]  You know, something happens when we get together, Granny.
[43:01.610 --> 43:06.610]  They opened the back door so the smoke alarms in the place didn't get shut down.
[43:07.610 --> 43:14.610]  Let's talk about the recent change in the rules at the cannabis clubs here in Colorado Springs.
[43:14.610 --> 43:16.610]  How do you feel about that, Granny?
[43:16.610 --> 43:17.610]  You know what?
[43:17.610 --> 43:23.610]  This podcast is going to air before September 21st.
[43:23.610 --> 43:31.610]  September 21st, I want a show of force at the courthouse here in Colorado Springs.
[43:31.610 --> 43:34.610]  They're shutting down our cannabis clubs again.
[43:34.610 --> 43:36.610]  Now, I want you to come out.
[43:36.610 --> 43:38.610]  We're not going to speak.
[43:38.610 --> 43:41.610]  We're just going to show that we support them.
[43:41.610 --> 43:45.610]  And I want you to come acting like adults.
[43:45.610 --> 43:46.610]  I don't want no silliness.
[43:46.610 --> 43:52.610]  So, if you can't come like professional people in the cannabis community, please stay home.
[43:52.610 --> 43:58.610]  But let's show these clubs that, no, we support you and we're not going to let the city shut you down.
[43:58.610 --> 43:59.610]  I'm upset.
[43:59.610 --> 44:00.610]  It's frustrating.
[44:00.610 --> 44:02.610]  Because you know the next step.
[44:02.610 --> 44:03.610]  They're going to shut them down.
[44:03.610 --> 44:05.610]  Then they're going to come after our grows.
[44:05.610 --> 44:06.610]  Us, our caregiver grows.
[44:06.610 --> 44:08.610]  They're already doing that here in Springs.
[44:08.610 --> 44:16.610]  They've limited how many plants you can have and they've shut it down to a number of plants where several of my friends who are veterans and patients are unable to grow the medicine that they need for themselves.
[44:16.610 --> 44:19.610]  And so their option was to go possibly to these clubs.
[44:19.610 --> 44:21.610]  And now they can't even go to these clubs.
[44:21.610 --> 44:23.610]  So, you guys, what we're talking about is the clubs.
[44:23.610 --> 44:28.610]  You are no longer allowed to consume cannabis in these cannabis social clubs.
[44:28.610 --> 44:33.610]  You are no longer allowed to reimburse them for product that they may provide for you.
[44:33.610 --> 44:36.610]  They're trying to do away with all of the social consumption clubs.
[44:36.610 --> 44:38.610]  And I don't think it's right.
[44:38.610 --> 44:39.610]  I think that we need these places.
[44:39.610 --> 44:42.610]  I think that without these places, we have to go smoke in our cars.
[44:42.610 --> 44:44.610]  We have to go smoke in the park.
[44:44.610 --> 44:45.610]  We have to go smoke in the alley.
[44:45.610 --> 44:52.610]  We have to go park in front of somebody weird's house and take a couple of dabs in our car, drive on to another weird house, park in front of their, take a couple of dabs.
[44:52.610 --> 44:55.610]  Because it's hard as shit to drive and dab in the city when you're on a lunch break.
[44:55.610 --> 44:59.610]  Or do you think some of these guys are going to go back to hanging out in the bars?
[44:59.610 --> 45:03.610]  Well, yeah, that's what a lot of people do, unfortunately.
[45:03.610 --> 45:08.610]  And I myself, if I didn't have cannabis, I would probably drink alcohol and I am no good at alcohol.
[45:08.610 --> 45:11.610]  I don't know if I'm no good at it or if I'm really, really good at it.
[45:11.610 --> 45:13.610]  I don't think anybody is good at it.
[45:13.610 --> 45:22.610]  And when we were leaving that event in Denver a few weeks ago and we drove through the bar, by the bars in downtown Denver.
[45:22.610 --> 45:23.610]  Oh, yeah.
[45:23.610 --> 45:27.610]  First thing we saw was a drunken female.
[45:27.610 --> 45:29.610]  Her boyfriend pushed her.
[45:29.610 --> 45:30.610]  She was so drunk.
[45:30.610 --> 45:32.610]  She fell into the intersection.
[45:32.610 --> 45:38.610]  There was four or five other drunk shouting obscenities and I just thought, I hate alcohol.
[45:38.610 --> 45:39.610]  Yeah.
[45:39.610 --> 45:42.610]  I was at an event with people with cannabis that left.
[45:42.610 --> 45:46.610]  They all left smiling and hugging and everybody was happy.
[45:46.610 --> 45:50.610]  High-fiving each other, feeling good, not going to be hung over tomorrow, not going to drive into stuff.
[45:50.610 --> 45:51.610]  So why can't we have our...
[45:51.610 --> 45:52.610]  And cancer free.
[45:52.610 --> 45:55.610]  Why can't we have our places to congregate?
[45:55.610 --> 45:56.610]  I agree.
[45:56.610 --> 46:01.610]  And the other thing we need to push for, Jeff, is, you know, they're coming after our medical.
[46:01.610 --> 46:02.610]  Yeah.
[46:02.610 --> 46:03.610]  Why are they trying to get rid of medical?
[46:03.610 --> 46:04.610]  That's not fair.
[46:04.610 --> 46:05.610]  That's what started the whole thing.
[46:05.610 --> 46:07.610]  We need medical marijuana for the patients.
[46:07.610 --> 46:08.610]  Yes, we do.
[46:08.610 --> 46:10.610]  Because let's think about it.
[46:10.610 --> 46:12.610]  We all want legalized cannabis.
[46:12.610 --> 46:13.610]  All of us do.
[46:13.610 --> 46:14.610]  But we're kind of being fooled.
[46:14.610 --> 46:15.610]  Watch the right hand.
[46:15.610 --> 46:17.610]  Don't pay attention to the left hand.
[46:17.610 --> 46:20.610]  We're going to give you legalized, but we're going to make it wreck.
[46:20.610 --> 46:24.610]  Okay, so what if you're truly a patient that truly, truly needs medical?
[46:24.610 --> 46:28.610]  More than likely, you are on a fixed income.
[46:28.610 --> 46:31.610]  You have a hard time affording your medicine to begin with.
[46:31.610 --> 46:35.610]  And so now we're going to add a 47% tax or more.
[46:35.610 --> 46:36.610]  Is that right?
[46:36.610 --> 46:38.610]  No, that's not right at all.
[46:38.610 --> 46:42.610]  And that's not what our system here in Colorado was designed for at all.
[46:42.610 --> 46:43.610]  And it's not just Colorado.
[46:43.610 --> 46:44.610]  I see it happening.
[46:44.610 --> 46:46.610]  First, it happened in Washington State.
[46:46.610 --> 46:49.610]  Now it's moving next door to Oregon.
[46:49.610 --> 46:51.610]  What's going to happen here in Colorado?
[46:51.610 --> 47:00.610]  Do you think eventually we will have a nationwide cannabis program that is run by one governing organization that takes care of all the marijuana, the alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and firearms?
[47:00.610 --> 47:05.610]  I think that's what our governing bodies want.
[47:05.610 --> 47:07.610]  Look how much money can be made.
[47:07.610 --> 47:08.610]  Tons of money.
[47:08.610 --> 47:10.610]  But that doesn't mean it's right.
[47:10.610 --> 47:12.610]  You know what?
[47:12.610 --> 47:16.610]  I see the cannabis community going the way of the family farm.
[47:16.610 --> 47:18.610]  It's going to go away.
[47:18.610 --> 47:19.610]  And what are you going to have to choose from?
[47:19.610 --> 47:20.610]  Look here, Jeff.
[47:20.610 --> 47:21.610]  We sit here.
[47:21.610 --> 47:22.610]  We have all this great medicine.
[47:22.610 --> 47:29.610]  If it becomes what the government is leading us to, you'll have a strain of Indica maybe and a strain of Sativa.
[47:29.610 --> 47:31.610]  It'll be a Monsanto, Rand product.
[47:31.610 --> 47:33.610]  And it will be icky.
[47:33.610 --> 47:34.610]  Walmart packaged, very regulated.
[47:34.610 --> 47:36.610]  It won't be your genetics.
[47:36.610 --> 47:37.610]  Oh, no.
[47:37.610 --> 47:38.610]  No, it'll be some GMO stuff.
[47:38.610 --> 47:41.610]  You will continue growing, but then we're back to breaking the law, aren't we?
[47:41.610 --> 47:42.610]  Right.
[47:42.610 --> 47:46.610]  So all I can say is we keep pushing for what we've been pushing for.
[47:46.610 --> 47:47.610]  Keep the medical in your...
[47:47.610 --> 47:49.610]  If you have medical where you are, don't get rid of it.
[47:49.610 --> 47:50.610]  Keep it.
[47:50.610 --> 47:51.610]  Medical is where it all started.
[47:51.610 --> 48:01.610]  And like I always say in almost every episode when we talk about social clubs, if you are writing legislation in your area for cannabis use, make sure you include somewhere to consume that cannabis.
[48:01.610 --> 48:12.610]  Make sure you include social lounges or social clubs, somewhere that you can purchase and consume cannabis with your friends like responsible adults because that's very much needed when you do legalize cannabis in a new area.
[48:12.610 --> 48:14.610]  Learn from us here in Colorado.
[48:15.610 --> 48:16.610]  We've always been...
[48:16.610 --> 48:20.610]  Everybody's had eyes on Colorado as far as the cannabis goes.
[48:20.610 --> 48:26.610]  We are learning this was something they slipped through and we just didn't pay any attention.
[48:26.610 --> 48:28.610]  So we thought, okay, we've got our clubs.
[48:28.610 --> 48:36.610]  Well, we were walking kind of in a gray area and now the city is not liking us any longer, for lack of a better word, I guess.
[48:36.610 --> 48:37.610]  They want tax money.
[48:37.610 --> 48:38.610]  Yes.
[48:38.610 --> 48:39.610]  It's all about tax money.
[48:39.610 --> 48:40.610]  All right.
[48:40.610 --> 48:44.610]  We've been going for 49 minutes and most people usually give up about one hour into a podcast.
[48:44.610 --> 48:48.610]  So we should start saying goodbye to all of the lovely people that have listened to the show.
[48:48.610 --> 48:51.610]  I'm going to ask one more question as we go around the circle.
[48:51.610 --> 48:52.610]  Granny, you'll be first.
[48:52.610 --> 48:53.610]  So hang on to your microphone here.
[48:53.610 --> 48:55.610]  One simple question, indica or sativa?
[48:55.610 --> 48:56.610]  Indica.
[48:56.610 --> 48:57.610]  All right.
[48:57.610 --> 48:58.610]  Nice and easy.
[48:58.610 --> 48:59.610]  Becca, do you even care?
[48:59.610 --> 49:00.610]  Sativa.
[49:00.610 --> 49:01.610]  Sativa.
[49:01.610 --> 49:02.610]  Okay.
[49:02.610 --> 49:03.610]  Did you just pick one randomly or just...
[49:03.610 --> 49:04.610]  No, when I smoke, I...
[49:04.610 --> 49:05.610]  Okay.
[49:05.610 --> 49:07.610]  And when I do smoke, I choose sativa.
[49:07.610 --> 49:08.610]  Okay.
[49:08.610 --> 49:09.610]  You smoke flowers, don't you, Becca?
[49:09.610 --> 49:10.610]  Oh, she smokes flowers too.
[49:10.610 --> 49:11.610]  Okay.
[49:11.610 --> 49:12.610]  I didn't even see, I didn't even think of flowers.
[49:12.610 --> 49:13.610]  I forgot all about the flowers.
[49:13.610 --> 49:14.610]  Shame on you.
[49:14.610 --> 49:15.610]  No, shame on me.
[49:15.610 --> 49:18.610]  Miss Dabigale, indica or sativa, honey?
[49:18.610 --> 49:20.610]  I like both, but I prefer sativa.
[49:20.610 --> 49:21.610]  Okay.
[49:21.610 --> 49:22.610]  That's fair enough.
[49:22.610 --> 49:24.610]  You don't have to act like you're like choosing sides or anything.
[49:24.610 --> 49:25.610]  We're not going to go to war.
[49:25.610 --> 49:26.610]  I'm just curious.
[49:26.610 --> 49:27.610]  Yeah, but I mean, yeah, sativa.
[49:27.610 --> 49:29.610]  Do you feel like you just, you're like, oh, sorry, indica.
[49:29.610 --> 49:30.610]  Sorry.
[49:30.610 --> 49:31.610]  Sorry.
[49:31.610 --> 49:32.610]  No, no, no.
[49:32.610 --> 49:33.610]  No apologies.
[49:33.610 --> 49:34.610]  All right.
[49:34.610 --> 49:35.610]  Miss Lydia, indica or sativa?
[49:35.610 --> 49:37.610]  Indica, for sure.
[49:37.610 --> 49:38.610]  Indica, for sure.
[49:38.610 --> 49:39.610]  For sure.
[49:39.610 --> 49:40.610]  All right.
[49:40.610 --> 49:41.610]  All right.
[49:41.610 --> 49:42.610]  I want to thank all of you guys for coming on the podcast.
[49:42.610 --> 49:45.610]  I want to thank you for letting me come and hang out in the front of your store and take
[49:45.610 --> 49:46.610]  dabs and eat pizza.
[49:46.610 --> 49:48.610]  Shout out to the pizza guy once again.
[49:48.610 --> 49:49.610]  That was super cool.
[49:49.610 --> 49:51.610]  Customer service like a champ.
[49:51.610 --> 49:52.610]  Yes.
[49:52.610 --> 49:53.610]  Ladies, thank you for joining me.
[49:53.610 --> 49:54.610]  Granny, thanks for putting this together.
[49:54.610 --> 49:55.610]  This was all your idea.
[49:55.610 --> 49:56.610]  I appreciate it.
[49:56.610 --> 49:57.610]  I'm glad it happened.
[49:57.610 --> 49:58.610]  I really am.
[49:58.610 --> 49:59.610]  Thank you.
[49:59.610 --> 50:00.610]  Thank you.
[50:00.610 --> 50:02.610]  Granny messaged me and she said, hey, I'm going to bring Rebecca and we're going to
[50:02.610 --> 50:05.610]  go to your house and do a podcast at your studio.
[50:05.610 --> 50:06.610]  I was like, that sounds like a good idea.
[50:06.610 --> 50:08.610]  I was like, let me know how it goes.
[50:08.610 --> 50:10.610]  She said, well, she closes the store at 8 and then she's free.
[50:10.610 --> 50:15.610]  I thought, wait, she closes the store at 8 and all the buttons in my head started pushing.
[50:15.610 --> 50:19.610]  I said, why don't I go to Elevate where the dabbing or the Elevate dolls are.
[50:19.610 --> 50:21.610]  I want to call you the dabbing dolls.
[50:21.610 --> 50:22.610]  Are you dabbing dolls?
[50:22.610 --> 50:23.610]  We totally do that.
[50:23.610 --> 50:24.610]  All right.
[50:24.610 --> 50:25.610]  Yes.
[50:25.610 --> 50:26.610]  We'll take it.
[50:26.610 --> 50:27.610]  Where the Elevate dolls are.
[50:27.610 --> 50:28.610]  This worked out very well.
[50:28.610 --> 50:29.610]  I was given a sweet gift.
[50:29.610 --> 50:31.610]  I was fed pizza and I got to hang out with some lovely ladies.
[50:31.610 --> 50:33.610]  Elevate is spelled E-L-E-V-8.
[50:33.610 --> 50:34.610]  Yes.
[50:34.610 --> 50:35.610]  Check it out, you guys.
[50:35.610 --> 50:37.610]  It's 517 South Dayhunt in Colorado Springs.
[50:37.610 --> 50:39.610]  I'm sure there's an Instagram page.
[50:39.610 --> 50:40.610]  Which one of you runs that?
[50:40.610 --> 50:41.610]  All of us.
[50:41.610 --> 50:42.610]  Oh, you see all.
[50:42.610 --> 50:43.610]  Yeah.
[50:43.610 --> 50:44.610]  All of the people who work at the store.
[50:44.610 --> 50:46.610]  And you have a website as well, don't you?
[50:46.610 --> 50:49.610]  Elevateglassgallery.com.
[50:49.610 --> 50:53.610]  And also make sure you check out Higher Elevation's Masterpiece Productions, their sister store.
[50:53.610 --> 50:55.610]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[50:55.610 --> 50:57.610]  There's so much glass in that store.
[50:57.610 --> 50:58.610]  Yeah.
[50:58.610 --> 50:59.610]  They're going on nine years.
[50:59.610 --> 51:00.610]  Nine years over there.
[51:00.610 --> 51:01.610]  Their birthday's October 1st also.
[51:01.610 --> 51:02.610]  Woohoo.
[51:02.610 --> 51:03.610]  Yeah.
[51:03.610 --> 51:04.610]  So make sure you come to the event.
[51:04.610 --> 51:06.610]  Granny, remind us the date of your event that you were talking about.
[51:06.610 --> 51:09.610]  October 1st down on El Paso.
[51:09.610 --> 51:10.610]  At DBK.
[51:10.610 --> 51:12.610]  DBK Glass.
[51:12.610 --> 51:15.610]  There's going to be like 30 plus local glass blowers.
[51:15.610 --> 51:17.610]  And Lazadank as Chili.
[51:17.610 --> 51:19.610]  And don't forget.
[51:19.610 --> 51:20.610]  That's scary.
[51:20.610 --> 51:25.610]  We're going to surprise them, but it is SSV Steve's birthday.
[51:25.610 --> 51:26.610]  Happy birthday, Steve.
[51:26.610 --> 51:27.610]  Happy birthday, brother.
[51:27.610 --> 51:28.610]  SSV Steve.
[51:28.610 --> 51:29.610]  He's a good guy.
[51:29.610 --> 51:33.610]  He's behind the scenes a lot, but he's a good guy in the cannabis community.
[51:33.610 --> 51:36.610]  And then October 22nd at the Black Sheep.
[51:36.610 --> 51:38.610]  A heady Halloween.
[51:38.610 --> 51:39.610]  A heady Halloween.
[51:39.610 --> 51:40.610]  Come in costume.
[51:40.610 --> 51:41.610]  Yes.
[51:41.610 --> 51:42.610]  Yes.
[51:42.610 --> 51:44.610]  Dress the best to impress and win some stuff.
[51:44.610 --> 51:45.610]  Yeah.
[51:45.610 --> 51:47.610]  Party with the elevators and all our glass blowers.
[51:47.610 --> 51:49.610]  And it's going to be so much fun.
[51:49.610 --> 51:50.610]  Dabbing Granny.
[51:50.610 --> 51:51.610]  Dabbing Granny will be there.
[51:51.610 --> 51:52.610]  Yes, I'm going to be there.
[51:52.610 --> 51:53.610]  And Rasta Jeff will be there.
[51:53.610 --> 51:55.610]  I'll have my recording gear with me part of the time.
[51:55.610 --> 51:57.610]  I hear there will be a dab bus.
[51:58.610 --> 51:59.610]  That's the word.
[51:59.610 --> 52:00.610]  What is that?
[52:00.610 --> 52:01.610]  And hula hoops.
[52:01.610 --> 52:05.610]  So it's going to be cold and the Black Sheep won't allow us to consume inside.
[52:05.610 --> 52:14.610]  So we're going to have a bus parked in the front so that we can dab safely and be warm and cozy.
[52:14.610 --> 52:16.610]  Because the bus is private property.
[52:16.610 --> 52:17.610]  Yes.
[52:17.610 --> 52:19.610]  And is not involved with the Black Sheep or their liquor license.
[52:19.610 --> 52:22.610]  So the separation and the unity work perfectly.
[52:22.610 --> 52:23.610]  I like that.
[52:23.610 --> 52:24.610]  Happy Colorado.
[52:24.610 --> 52:25.610]  Yay.
[52:25.610 --> 52:26.610]  Yep.
[52:26.610 --> 52:32.610]  I hope to see all of you that are listening to the show at the Black Sheep at the birthday party on October 22nd.
[52:32.610 --> 52:33.610]  I'll be in costume.
[52:33.610 --> 52:34.610]  I think it will be really hot in there.
[52:34.610 --> 52:36.610]  I'll take off my mask and you'll go, there he is.
[52:36.610 --> 52:37.610]  It will be really fun.
[52:37.610 --> 52:39.610]  I look forward to taking a dab with you on the dab bus.
[52:39.610 --> 52:41.610]  Maybe we can put somebody on the podcast.
[52:41.610 --> 52:42.610]  You can tell us what you think.
[52:42.610 --> 52:43.610]  Look forward to seeing you.
[52:43.610 --> 52:45.610]  Ladies, thanks again for joining me.
[52:45.610 --> 52:46.610]  Thanks for having us.
[52:46.610 --> 52:49.610]  You guys need to start like a vocal group.
[52:49.610 --> 52:50.610]  That was rad.
[52:50.610 --> 52:52.610]  Uh-oh, someone's at the door.
[52:52.610 --> 52:54.610]  There's a little chihuahua at the door.
[52:54.610 --> 52:56.610]  I think that's a good way to wrap up the podcast.
[52:56.610 --> 52:57.610]  That dog's saying, shut up in there.
[52:57.610 --> 52:58.610]  You guys are too loud.
[52:58.610 --> 52:59.610]  We have pizza.
[52:59.610 --> 53:01.610]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up this portion of the podcast.
[53:01.610 --> 53:03.610]  I'll be back and we will put a tail on this.
[53:03.610 --> 53:04.610]  Thank you guys for listening.
[53:05.610 --> 53:06.610]  All right, podcast world.
[53:06.610 --> 53:09.610]  I want to thank you guys again for listening to another episode.

[53:47.610 --> 53:48.610]  Big shout out to my ninja spits.
[53:49.610 --> 53:53.610]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[58:48.100 --> 58:49.100]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[58:49.100 --> 58:56.100]  It's time for episode number 155 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[58:56.100 --> 59:01.100]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[59:01.100 --> 59:05.100]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[59:05.100 --> 59:08.100]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[59:09.100 --> 59:10.100]  I'm your host, my friends.
[59:10.100 --> 59:11.100]  Call me Rasta Jeff.
[59:11.100 --> 59:12.100]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.

[59:18.100 --> 59:22.100]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.

[59:25.100 --> 59:27.100]  I hope you're taking some dabs with me, ladies and gentlemen.
[59:27.100 --> 59:28.100]  I hope you've got a fat joint rolled up.
[59:28.100 --> 59:31.100]  I hope you've got a blunt rolled up with some hash down the middle of it.
[59:31.100 --> 59:33.100]  I hope you're doing something to adjust your vibe.
[59:33.100 --> 59:35.100]  I hope you're getting nice and iry with me.
[59:35.100 --> 59:41.100]  I just took some big fat dabs of some Taffy and Cascade Nug Run Shatter from our friends at TerpX.
[59:41.100 --> 59:43.100]  It tastes delicious.
[59:43.100 --> 59:46.100]  It actually kind of had a sort of a pineapple aftertaste to it.
[59:46.100 --> 59:47.100]  I really enjoy it.
[59:47.100 --> 59:48.100]  Good stuff.
[59:48.100 --> 59:53.100]  By the time you hear this, it'll all be sold out because they sell that stuff really quickly over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[59:53.100 --> 59:59.100]  You guys, in this episode, I'm going to address some emails that have been sent to me and some questions that I received on social media.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.100]  I've got a really good question that I have titled the Terp Sizzle.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.100]  We're going to talk about why somebody's got some sizzling terps.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:11.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, before we get that far, I do need to make a very special announcement.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.100]  I was talking about getting my hash at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:20.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was known as the master grower or the lead cultivator or whatever you want to call it at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.100]  I am no longer involved with Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.100]  We're still friends.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.100]  I'm friends with everybody over there.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.100]  I'm still hanging out.
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.100]  Hunt and I are still bros.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.100]  Amy and I are still bros.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.100]  They say she's a chick, but we're still bros.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.100]  Lindsey and I are definitely still bros forever.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:37.100]  Breezy and I were never real close bros, but Breezy and I are still bros.
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.100]  I've got no problem with the Green and Healthy crew.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.100]  I'm just no longer a part of that.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.100]  I am moving on to do different things.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.100]  I want to focus more on breeding.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.100]  I want to focus more on my stuff instead of working for another company.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.100]  I had a great time there.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.100]  I have no problem with those folks.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.100]  I completely appreciate the opportunity they gave me.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:57.100]  We have a different vision, and I want to do my own thing, to tell you the damn truth.
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.100]  I'm no longer part of that.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.100]  Much love to that whole crew.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.100]  Shout out to Hunt.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.100]  Shout out to the entire Green and Healthy Wellness crew.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.100]  I just wanted to make sure that everybody knows I am no longer a part of that company.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.100]  I get a lot of emails and questions, and people ask me a lot of things about the commercial grow from there.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.100]  I just wanted to be straight up.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.100]  I am no longer a part of that.
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.100]  All right, moving forward.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.100]  What the hell am I doing since I'm no longer there?
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.100]  I'm working on my breeding projects, you guys.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.100]  I have got some...
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.100]  I've been talking about the breeding project here on the show recently.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.100]  I've got a breeding project.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:32.100]  It is about 50 days into flower at this point, which means it's probably close to 35-ish days since it has been pollinated,
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:37.100]  which means in about 7 to 10, maybe 14 days, I'm keeping a real close eye on it,
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:42.100]  I will be able to chop these plants down, and I will be able to harvest the seeds.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.100]  As soon as the plants dry up, I'll pull the seeds out, and then I'll be able to let them dry a little bit.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.100]  Then I'll package them up, and I'll get them in a few of my friends' hands,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.100]  and we will see what Arise F2 has done.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.100]  We'll see what comes from that.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.100]  I've also got Grateful Dog Female pollinated by the Arise Male.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.100]  I'm really excited to see what that's going to do.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:08.100]  There's a Lemon Skunk pollinated by the Arise, and of course, I did the Golden Goat pollinated by the Arise in there.
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.100]  Those seeds will be done in like 15 days, you guys.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.100]  I'm really excited about it.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.100]  The seeds are getting chunky.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.100]  I've been pulling...
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.100]  I've pulled three seeds out total so far just to do investigation.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.100]  I have to see what's going on in there.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.100]  I just get a seed in a normal spot of the plant, pull one seed out, clean it up, take a look at it.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.100]  I actually tried to germinate one.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.100]  It did not germ.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.100]  I was just really curious.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.100]  That's where we are with the breeding project.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:33.100]  I have a lot more breeding projects planned and lined up and charted and in my head.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.100]  I know what the females are going to be.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:41.100]  I know what male I'm going to use, and there is going to be some heat coming up from the Irie Genetics Gardens very soon.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.100]  All right, so that's what's going on with the breeding project.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.100]  What's going on with me?
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100]  Gosh, I'm going to cough, you guys.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.100]  I apologize.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.100]  There we go.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.100]  Shout out to the dabs.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.100]  Shout out to Elevate and the new dab rig they gave me.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:55.100]  I'm sure I mentioned it on the last episode, but they gave me a sweet dab rig with the Lion of Judah on it.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.100]  I just took a fat dab.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.100]  Kind of coughing a little bit, but it's a good thing.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.100]  What have I been doing?
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:07.100]  On Monday night, I got the honor to go see one of my favorite reggae artists, the master, Sizzla Kalonji.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.100]  It was at Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom in Denver.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.100]  That was a great show.
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.100]  There was an opening act by the name of Dubskin.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.100]  I thought I had seen Dubskin before and didn't like them, but I was completely wrong, you guys.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:24.100]  The band that played that night that was called Dubskin was fucking great.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:29.100]  Their drummer was very charismatic and played very creative reggae beats.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.100]  In my opinion, a reggae drummer is either boring or really good.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:38.100]  You either lock in and you play reggae beats or you kind of fill in and you do a lot of cool shit.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.100]  And he's one of those guys that gets on top of it and plays a lot of cool shit.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.100]  I really liked his sound.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.100]  I liked the way he played.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.100]  Shout out to Dubskin.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.100]  They did a great set.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:53.100]  Very Colorado-esque reggae is my best way to describe that.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.100]  Then, of course, Sizzla Kalonji came on stage.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.100]  Something happened when the band switched.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.100]  When Dubskin left and Sizzla came on, something in the soundboard happened.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.100]  And the drums sounded like shit when Sizzla came on.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.100]  And I don't know.
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.100]  I'm not a sound guy, but I obviously run a podcast.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.100]  I've got a soundboard.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.100]  I'm a drummer.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.100]  I was really bummed out when the drums sounded like shit.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.100]  But I tried to get past it, you guys.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.100]  I tried to look for the good.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100]  I was seeing one of my favorite reggae artists.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.100]  He came from Jamaica.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.100]  I had to show appreciation.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.100]  I had to get iry.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.100]  I had to show some support.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.100]  I had to get down.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.100]  Sizzla puts on an amazing show, you guys.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.100]  That dude put on.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:32.100]  He used more energy in an hour and 30-minute set than most of us use in our entire day.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.100]  He came out on stage in a long-sleeve button-up shirt.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:39.100]  I don't know how long his dreadlocks are, but I assume they are quite long.
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.100]  But he always keeps them tied up.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.100]  This dude's always got his dreads and a turban on his head.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.100]  So, he's got a turban filled with dreadlocks on his head.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.100]  And he's under the lights at the concert.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.100]  And he's running in place, basically, for an hour and a half and singing and not missing a beat while singing.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.100]  And this dude was covered in sweat.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.100]  It looked like he ran through the sprinklers.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.100]  He was so sweaty.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.100]  So, that dude put out huge energy, even though he was kind of frustrated with the sound.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.100]  I could tell.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.100]  I'm a musician.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.100]  I've watched enough stage shows.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.100]  I've been involved.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.100]  I could tell that the drummer couldn't hear the monitor mix.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.100]  So, he was falling off the beat a little bit, trying to listen to everything.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.100]  That was fucking up the singer.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.100]  And the singer was getting mad and was kind of showing it a little bit.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.100]  But it was a great show, you guys.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.100]  If you ever get the chance to see Sizzla Kalonji, go do it.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:28.100]  Also, if you get a chance to see a show at Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom in Denver, do it.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.100]  Leave all your fancy shit at home.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.100]  You don't want to park right there with a bunch of fancy shit in your car, though.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.100]  That's kind of a sketchy area.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.100]  Shout-out to Denver.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100]  All right, you guys.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100]  Let's talk about cannabis.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:43.100]  Let's get to some of the emails that I have received because I've been talking about my stuff for too long.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.100]  Let's get to it.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.100]  I'm opening up an email right now.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.100]  I'm unlocking the phone.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.100]  I've got a screenshot of a message I received.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.100]  I'll quit clearing my throat.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.100]  This message came from a friend on Instagram.
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.100]  He calls himself TerpsOnly710.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.100]  And they said, Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.100]  Just recently, I was gifted some pure terps.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.100]  The first time I've encountered these before, so I don't know too much besides they taste great.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.100]  Sorry, guys.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.100]  I'm trying so hard not to cough.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.100]  There it is.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]  I got it out of my way.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.100]  I coughed.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.100]  Here we go.
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:19.100]  I get a small dab of some other concentrate, then drop a drip of terps on it, and it comes out great and tastes amazing.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:26.100]  The thing is the terps make the dab sizzle a tiny bit, not like the 4th of July Tane Brain status, but definitely a small sizzle.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.100]  That wouldn't happen to the concentrate without the added terps.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.100]  Is this normal, they ask.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.100]  And then they also said, Any info would be great.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.100]  Thank you.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.100]  Long time podcast listener.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.100]  Hey, thanks for listening.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:45.100]  And then they say, Can honestly say I've listened to all episodes since episode one, and I feel like we're best friends.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.100]  Well, we are.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:50.100]  If you've been listening for that long, we're friends.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:54.100]  I've been listening to Chris Hardwick, the nerdist.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:58.100]  I've been following Chris Hardwick basically since he was on Singled Out in the early 90s.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:03.100]  And I've seen Chris Hardwick spiral out of control and ruin his career and then get his shit back together.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.100]  And now Chris Hardwick is on top of his game.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:09.100]  And I heard Chris Hardwick say several years ago that all he ever wanted to do was play Red Rocks.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:14.100]  And I got to see Chris Hardwick at the Oddball Comedy Tour a couple of years ago play Red Rocks.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:20.100]  And it felt like I was watching one of my friends reach his goals because I've been following him for so long and I listened to his podcast.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.100]  So I completely know what you mean about us being friends.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:30.100]  And I agree if we ever meet, if I walk past you at an event, if we're in the same area, you better come say what's up and introduce yourself because we're friends now.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.100]  All right, let's get to the point.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.100]  You said you've listened since episode number one.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.100]  Wow, I'm embarrassed when I think about episode one, but thank you.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.100]  I appreciate it.
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.100]  Thanks for sticking along.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:43.100]  So you asked about dab sizzle.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.100]  Yeah, that's understandable.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:48.100]  And that's acceptable, I think, as long as it's not going too crazy.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:52.100]  The first thing I'm going to say is you might have your nail just a little bit too hot when you're dabbing.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100]  You might want to let the nail cool.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.100]  If you're using the e-nail, turn it down just a little bit if you're getting too much sizzle.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:02.100]  But what's happening is I'm going to pick up my little jar of turps here and let these turps talk me through this.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100]  The turps are liquid.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.100]  At least my turps are completely liquid.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]  I'm holding them in a jar.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:09.100]  I could pour them out of this little vial if I wanted to.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.100]  They are completely liquid.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.100]  So you're putting that liquid onto your dab.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.100]  And also, you might be using a little bit more than necessary.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:24.100]  If you're pouring it onto there and it's sizzling when you dab it, you might be able to put about half of that and conserve your dabs a little bit and make it last twice as long.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.100]  And you're still going to get the flavor.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.100]  You're still going to get everything.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:28.100]  I know how it is.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.100]  I'm excessive, too.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100]  I like to do big, fat dabs with way too much turps.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.100]  But if it's sizzling, that might be part of the thing.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.100]  But what's happening is you're just putting moisture on a hot nail.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.100]  And if you would put water on a hot nail, it would sizzle.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:50.100]  Sometimes in the summer when you get sweaty and you have to manhandle your shatter with your fingers because there's no other way to pick it up or whatever, sometimes a dab will sizzle from that, too, because it's got moisture from your fingers.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:55.100]  So all that's happening is basically you're boiling the turps on the hot nail.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:09:00.100]  So when they hit the nail, it's just like you're throwing some water in a skillet and it's going, and you're just getting that sizzle.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.100]  It's not a problem.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.100]  It's not a bad thing.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.100]  You might be too hot.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.100]  You might be using too much turps.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.100]  So just check those two things out.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:12.100]  Or shit, honestly, if you like the way it works, do it that way.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.100]  If that's what you're into, do it that way.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.100]  Take too big of a dab with way too many turps on it, smoke it up.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.100]  But it's not a problem.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.100]  There's nothing wrong with your turps that I know of from that description.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.100]  It sounds like just science happening.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:27.100]  You guys, I'm going to take a drink and another dab and hopefully get rid of this thing in my throat.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.100]  All right, podcast world, I should be cool for a couple of minutes.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.100]  Thanks for dealing with my coughs, my throat clearing.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.100]  I apologize for that.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.100]  All right.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.100]  So I was talking about turp sizzle.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.100]  You should be cool.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.100]  I don't think you have too much of a problem there.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.100]  Thank you for the message.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.100]  If you have any more questions about your turps, please send that message to me.
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.100]  I would love to hear more about your turps.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.100]  What kind of turps are you dabbing?
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.100]  Where'd you get them?
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.100]  And are you sure those are cannabis derived terpenes?
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.100]  That's what I want to know.
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.100]  All right.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.100]  Our next email came from Mazar421, and he says,
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.100]  Greetings, Rasta Jeff.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.100]  I have a couple of questions for you.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.100]  I was hoping to hear your thoughts on.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:06.100]  Question number one, I'm always reading and researching on cannabis cultivation for endless hours.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:14.100]  I was hoping you could list your top three books that you have found a lot of good information from or have heard good things about.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.100]  I really love this question.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:21.100]  I love going to the internet for answers, but the problem with the internet is that anybody can post anything,
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:28.100]  and I find a lot of bullshit posted on the internet, and I see people giving people advice that is just going to lead to more problems,
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.100]  and they're not getting to the root of the evil.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.100]  They're like, hey, I've got this problem, and they're like, well, then do this.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:40.100]  And I'm like, oh, shit, that's just going to make the problem you've got even worse and cause three more problems down the line that you're not aware of.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:47.100]  I try to teach new growers to avoid the internet a little bit because the internet can be really full of shit.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.100]  The way to go is trusted books from trusted authors.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.100]  If you want to know three books, I would highly recommend.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:03.100]  The first one I would recommend for everybody is called Marijuana Botany, an Advanced Study, the Propagation and Breeding of Distinctive Cannabis.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:13.100]  I know that's a really long title, but if you go to Amazon.com and you search for Marijuana Botany by Robert Connell Clark, you will find that book.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.100]  It's less than $20 with free shipping.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:21.100]  So that's the book I would start with, Marijuana Botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.100]  Then I would go with another trusted classic.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:30.100]  I would go with the Marijuana Horticulture Indoor-Outdoor Medical Growers Bible from Jorge Cervantes.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.100]  Jorge is kind of old school.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.100]  Actually, both of the authors I've told you about are kind of old school.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.100]  All three of the authors I'm going to tell you about are kind of old school.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:41.100]  They started growing cannabis and breeding cannabis probably before I was born.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.100]  So these guys have been doing it for a long time.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:53.100]  A lot of their techniques are very old and they seem a little outdated, but this plant has been around forever and these guys were doing it right back then and this shit still works.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.100]  It's like karate. You got to learn the basics.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.100]  You start off as a white belt and your goal is to get that crystal green belt.
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:05.100]  So you got to start off as a white belt, get these books, get a good foundation, and then build on that from there.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:09.100]  So the first book, again, was Marijuana Botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:15.100]  The second book is the Marijuana Horticulture Indoor-Outdoor Medical Growers Bible from Jorge Cervantes.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.100]  They keep updating that book. I'm sure you can find it on Amazon for like $20.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:26.100]  Then the third book I would recommend is Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Growers Handbook, which is actually the Oakster Dam Course Guide.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:32.100]  It is the book that they use at Oakster Dam in California to teach people how to grow cannabis professionally.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:36.100]  This book is very in-depth and I really like the way it's laid out.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:44.100]  It teaches you the basics of how to set up a grow, how to maintain your setup, what size of a grow to set up.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:50.100]  It teaches you about how to find males and females. It teaches you about cloning, vegging, flowering.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:54.100]  It teaches you how to look for bugs, how to identify bugs. This is a great book.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:02.100]  It's Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Growers Handbook, and then it's also known as Your Complete Guide for Medical Marijuana.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:08.100]  That one, I'm looking at it right now on Amazon for $23.99 with $4.99 shipping.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.100]  I'm sure if I shopped around a little bit, we could find it for cheaper.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.100]  Those are the first three books I would start with.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:21.100]  Then there's a book by Soma that I really like. I do not have the book sitting next to me right now, but it's a small, thin paperback cannabis book from Soma.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:26.100]  Then DJ Shore also wrote a book by the same publisher that Soma's book is out from.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:32.100]  Then there's also a book called Let's Grow a Pound, which is a very useful book in my opinion.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:38.100]  It's called Let's Grow a Pound from Seymour Buds. I think that book would do every grower some justice.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:42.100]  It goes from day one of the grow all the way up to harvest. It is a very helpful guide.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:48.100]  While I'm thinking about it, let's throw in a book called Secrets of the West Coast Masters by a dude named Drew West.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.100]  That should be plenty of books to get you started.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.100]  You can find a lot of those books on PDF form for free on the internet somewhere.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.100]  Just a quick search and you should be able to find them.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.100]  All of those books will be available on Amazon.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:05.100]  If you have any questions that you need answered with more depth or if you need more interaction, feel free to send me more questions.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100]  I will answer them.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.100]  You know my email address. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.100]  Those are my favorite books.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:14.100]  Let's get to part two of your question.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.100]  Part two of your question goes like this.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:22.100]  I have read that digital ballast can mess with and disrupt radio signals like ham radio and Wi-Fi cable reception.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.100]  Do you know this to be true?
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.100]  Have you heard you are all right as long as they have something called an RF shield?
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:33.100]  Then he says, thanks again for the love on the show and keep dabbing and sipping on that drink.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.100]  That's funny because I said I need a little sip one time.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.100]  I knew somebody was going to give me shit about that.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.100]  Thanks for paying attention.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.100]  Let's talk about digital ballasts that mess with and disrupt radio signals.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.100]  That is possible.
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.100]  They do put off a frequency.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:53.100]  If that frequency matches your TV or your radio, it could definitely cause interference or be picked up by something.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:15:04.100]  The thing is most of the digital ballasts available work at a much higher frequency than what most personal electronics would work at.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:10.100]  Most of them are in the 200 range and most of your personal appliances are in the 60 range.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.100]  You should not have any problem.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:17.100]  When it does happen, you are usually using a lot of ballasts like more than 15 or 20.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.100]  That would be enough ballast to disrupt some signal.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:32.100]  Or when you are getting imported Chinese ballasts that are poorly made from other countries and they have a lower frequency vibration, those will be more likely to cause a problem.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:39.100]  The thing that people are worried about is that they are putting off an RF frequency and that frequency is able to be picked up by law enforcement.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.100]  That makes a lot of people paranoid.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:51.100]  Most of the new ballasts are made with an RF shield inside of them and they are at such a high frequency that it will not disrupt your household appliances.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.100]  It will not disrupt your Wi-Fi.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.100]  Back in the day that was a thing but they have solved that problem now.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.100]  You should be cool.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:02.100]  The alternative to the new digital ballast is you can go with your old magnetic ballast.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.100]  The problem with those is it is hard to take good photography.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.100]  They make your pictures look like shit.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.100]  That is your option.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:14.100]  You can either have the digital ballast and be paranoid about the RF frequency or you can have those old magnetics and you can take shitty pictures.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.100]  I really do not think you have anything to worry about.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:20.100]  Most of the new ballasts you should be just fine in my opinion.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.100]  There is a huge article on THC Farmer about this.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.100]  If you want to read about it on THC Farmer, that is where I did my research.
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.100]  A lot of those guys bicker about it.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:32.100]  From what I read, I think we will all be okay with our digital ballasts.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.100]  I truly appreciate your interaction and your emails.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.100]  I will keep dabbing and sipping on that drink.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:41.100]  If you keep sending me good emails like this, I appreciate your message.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.100]  Mazar421
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.100]  I have another email.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.100]  This one comes from our friend Artie.
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:53.100]  He says, hey Rasta Jeff, do not remember the episode but you mentioned a female plant dying as soon as you put it in the room with the girls.
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:17:01.100]  Well, I had the same exact thing happen except my damn killer male plant shriveled up and died within 48 hours of entering the room.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.100]  Any idea on either situation?
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.100]  Thanks for the show again.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.100]  Hope to see that black cherry chem soon.
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.100]  Artie.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:19.100]  A long time ago, I did a breeding project where I had a reversed golden goat in the room.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.100]  I had a golden goat that was a female.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:26.100]  I applied silver thiosulfate to it for about 14 days before I put it into flower.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.100]  I put it into flower.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.100]  I continued applying silver thiosulfate to this plant.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:35.100]  This golden goat plant became a male that produced male pollen.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.100]  This is how I make feminized seeds.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:43.100]  I put female plants in that room so that they can receive that pollen.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.100]  I timed the plants differently.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.100]  Some plants go in early.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.100]  Some plants go in later for breeding.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.100]  I put the plants in.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.100]  Most of the girls looked great.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.100]  I put a clone of headband in that room to flower.
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.100]  It was a female.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.100]  It looked okay.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:06.100]  As soon as the pollen from that reversed golden goat plant hit that female headband plant, that plant shriveled up and died overnight.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:10.100]  I do not know what caused it because all of the plants in that room got treated the same.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.100]  Everything was the same.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.100]  The feed was the same.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.100]  The amount of water they got was basically the same.
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:17.100]  Nobody was overfed.
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.100]  Nobody was underfed.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.100]  Nobody was over or under watered.
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.100]  Everything seemed legit in there.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.100]  The temperature was cool.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.100]  There were not bugs in there.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.100]  Everything was cool.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.100]  For some reason, when the pollen hit that plant, the whole plant died.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100]  I have no idea what caused it.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.100]  I have talked to other breeders about it.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:34.100]  They all scratch their heads and look at me like I'm crazy.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.100]  They are like, I do not know.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.100]  Something else was wrong.
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.100]  I do not know what happened.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:41.100]  This guy said he had something similar happen.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:47.100]  He said his killer male plant shriveled up and died within 48 hours of entering the room.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.100]  I have no idea on that.
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.100]  That's really weird.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:56.100]  You took a male plant from a veg room and then you put it into the flowering room to initiate flower,
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:59.100]  and within 48 hours, it straight up croaked and died.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:02.100]  I do not know offhand what would cause that.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.100]  I've got a few guesses.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:09.100]  First, I would like to know, was that plant, is this a soil or a hydro grow?
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:14.100]  That's something that I really am curious about because soil is much more forgiving.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:20.100]  In hydro, you have more option to damage the roots, and everything happens much more quickly in hydro.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:23.100]  That would explain a little bit more if it were hydro.
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:29.100]  My main question is, did it go from a T5 light to right underneath a 1,000-watt light?
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.100]  That may have been a little bit much.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:37.100]  You may have just fucking microwaved it or barbecued it or broiled it, however you want to put it.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.100]  You may have just put that little tiny plant that came from a T5 or a little fluorescent.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.100]  If you moved it to 1,000 and put the 1,000 too close, you might have roasted it.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.100]  You might have just overpowered it.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.100]  It wasn't ready for all that.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.100]  You gave it too much energy and it died.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:54.100]  It may have had too little light also.
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:59.100]  You may have gone from your 1,000-watt in your veg room where there was only that one plant,
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:03.100]  and you had all the space, and then you put it in the other room, and it was not getting enough light.
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.100]  Maybe that killed it.
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.100]  Maybe it was overcrowded.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.100]  Maybe you hit it between a bunch of girls and it didn't get enough air.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.100]  That's possible.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.100]  But maybe it got too hot.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.100]  Maybe it got too cold.
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.100]  Maybe it got too wet.
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:20.100]  Before you carried it into the flower room or when you put it in the flower room, did you get excited and overwater it?
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.100]  You're like, this sucker is going to be a beast, and you overwater it.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.100]  Or did you overfeed it?
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.100]  Or did it need nutrients?
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.100]  I don't know your room.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:34.100]  If I could walk into your grow room and look at the room and the other plants, that's another question I need to ask myself.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.100]  How do the other plants look?
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.100]  Do you have other plants in that room?
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.100]  Do you have females in there that look happy?
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.100]  Because if the females in the room look happy, then it's just this one plant we've got to figure out.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:47.100]  But if all the plants are shitty, then it's the room we have to figure out.
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.100]  So there are a lot of questions.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:52.100]  I wish I could walk into the room with plants and see what's going on in there.
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:59.100]  I wish I could just walk in, take a quick look around the entire room, look at your ducting, look at your lighting, look at your source of fresh air,
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:03.100]  look at how you're getting rid of the old air, look at how you're handling humidity.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.100]  There are a lot of things I would like to see in there that would help me answer this.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:10.100]  Unfortunately, I'm not able to view your room through my brain yet.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.100]  In the fucking future, that'll be so handy when we can do that.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.100]  I'll just teleport to your room.
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:16.100]  I'll check it out right quick, tell you what's going on.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.100]  But I can't do that.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:24.100]  So if you want to send me some pictures or send me some follow-ups to all of the stuff that I just said, I will talk about it further on the show.
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.100]  Let me know what's going on.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:29.100]  Because it is really strange that you put a plant into a room and it died within 48 hours.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.100]  Check on all the things that I asked.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.100]  You probably checked all that.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.100]  You sound like an experienced grower.
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.100]  That was probably all the stuff you went to right away.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.100]  But check that out.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:44.100]  If it was hydro and you moved it from another room to another room, I'm assuming there was some root damage is what caused that plant to die.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:53.100]  Because last night, I transplanted a medium amount of clones from an Easy Cloner into Solo Cups with soil.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.100]  And I got kind of hasty and I was in a hurry.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.100]  And I felt myself kind of fuck one up when I pushed the soil down.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.100]  And I felt it press too hard and I kind of felt the roots crush.
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:05.100]  Today, that plant's all drooped over and looks really pissed off.
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.100]  It may pull through.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.100]  It may die.
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.100]  I can spare that clone.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.100]  It's not a big deal.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.100]  I like having 100% success.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.100]  I'm going to have 99% because of that fucker.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:21.100]  But just a little bit of root damage on a hydro plant is a huge difference in happiness compared to just a soil plant.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.100]  You can't mess up the roots as much on a soil plant is what I'm getting at.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:27.100]  I guess the bottom line is I really don't know what caused your plant to die.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.100]  I wish I had a better answer for you.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.100]  I really hope you had a clone of that male plant.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:35.100]  If not, you just got to get some seeds and do some more pheno hunting.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:41.100]  When you email me back, let me know what strain you were working with and how many seeds you went through to find that male.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.100]  I've got questions for you also.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.100]  And we'll talk about this more on a future episode.
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.100]  All right, Artie, I want to thank you once again for that email.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.100]  I hope to hear back from you.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.100]  You guys, I received two emails.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.100]  One was about LEC.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.100]  That's light emitting ceramic lighting.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100]  The new 315 seemed to be really popular.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:05.100]  The company that makes the 315s just put out a smaller version, lower wattage light.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.100]  I haven't paid too much attention to that.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.100]  I need to do some research on it.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.100]  Also, I got an email about LED, light emitting diode lighting.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.100]  Honestly, you guys, I've never grown with an LED.
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.100]  I've never grown with an LEC.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:21.100]  I've used some T5s and some 1000-watt HBSs and some 1000-watt metal halides.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100]  That's how I've grown.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:30.100]  I've done some 4s and 6s, but I mean I've never done anything other than high-intensity discharge lighting.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.100]  So, I'm going to find the people that make the 315s.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:38.100]  You guys, if you can put me in touch with the guy that makes the 315s, I'd love to get him on the podcast.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.100]  Let him know.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.100]  Have him email me.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:42.100]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.100]  He's here in Colorado.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.100]  I know I can find him.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.100]  I'll get him on the podcast.
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:51.100]  Also, I would like to have somebody that represents, manufactures, or works with an LED company
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.100]  or somebody that has grown with LEDs a lot.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.100]  I'd like you to come on the show and teach us about LEDs
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.100]  and maybe run us through the differences of LED lighting and HID lighting
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:03.100]  because I honestly don't have experience in that department.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:07.100]  If you're a pro at that and you're able to articulately tell our listeners about that stuff,
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.100]  I'd love to get you on the podcast.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.100]  So, that's what I've got for you about LECs and LEDs.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:16.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got a question you'd like me to talk about on the show,
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.100]  send me an email.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.100]  It's GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:22.100]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:26.100]  In the next episode, we are going to talk about a recent cease and desist letter
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:30.100]  that was sent to the cannabis lounges in Colorado Springs,
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:33.100]  and I will also answer a few more emails.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:36.100]  Once again, I want to thank everybody that sent me messages.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.100]  I would prefer it if you sent me the messages at GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.100]  That's the best way to get in touch with me.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:45.100]  If we're already corresponding on Instagram or wherever it is, keep doing it there.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.100]  That's cool.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.100]  If you send me messages, I would love to get those at GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.100]  Again, that is the best way.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.100]  Please send me more questions.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.100]  I love building content based on your questions.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.100]  That lets me know I'm hitting my audience.
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:00.100]  It lets me know I'm helping people out with information they actually need
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:04.100]  instead of just talking about random things that aren't helping anybody.
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.100]  So, I appreciate it. Keep it coming.
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.100]  I want to give a huge shout-out to my buddy, John Randles Jr.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.100]  John, boy, I haven't seen you in quite a while.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.100]  I hope you're doing well, buddy.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.100]  All right.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to sponsor the podcast
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.100]  or if you've got a product you'd like me to review, send me an email.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.100]  I'll say it one more time, GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.100]  I would love to check out your product.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, now that the show is over, I would love it if you go to iTunes.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.100]  Go to the iTunes store.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.100]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.100]  Also, when you're there, you have the option to give me some stars.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.100]  Of course, I'd ask for a five-star rating.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.100]  Honestly, give me what you feel I deserve.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.100]  Click on some stars.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.100]  Type in a comment.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:44.100]  Let me know what you think.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.100]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.100]  Also, I'd love it if you guys follow me on Twitter.
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.100]  It's at GFYH Podcast.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.100]  Also, find me on Facebook.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:53.100]  It's simply the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for you this week.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.100]  I'll be back in a few days.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.100]  Big shout-out to my ninja Spence.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:02.100]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:22.260]  Sometime the things you need in life may be difficult, not all the time it's gonna be easy.
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:29.600]  Stay above the wicked and fly.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:37.110]  Call myself Babylon and feeling good damn, that's the problem.
[01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:41.110]  I smoke the marijuana, I'm getting high.
[01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:45.450]  Stay above the wicked and fly.
[01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:48.450]  Never got problem at home domestically.
[01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:54.850]  And my girl she just want to marijuana and get high
[01:26:54.850 --> 01:27:03.790]  Stay above the wicked and fly
[01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:09.380]  Put my problems behind me and smoke the marijuana and get high
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.380]  Above the wicked and fly
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:15.380]  Cause I'm so confident in myself
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:19.380]  There's nothing or no one that could get to me
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.380]  Not even the damn system solicits properly
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:26.380]  Right now I'm very un-ter-y and living happily
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:30.380]  If those Babylonians mess with us today the music I play
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.380]  And smoke my problems away
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.380]  Me and couple of my friends we're just chilling on the corner
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:40.380]  Listening to the music from Jamaica to Bahamas
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:43.380]  Yeah, we decided to go link the farm
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.380]  And if something for the brain, it's the marijuana
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.380]  Happy as a lark when the good vibes come up
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:54.380]  When the chanting starts you get burned if you come up with smoke all day
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:57.380]  And still we got the earth to rub up
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.380]  Go to Babylon and erupt
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:04.380]  We give thanks for the stay we keep the meditation
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.380]  Music and more music we burn the pagans
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.380]  No ifs, no buts, no argument
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:14.380]  Marijuana is my holy sacrament
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:18.380]  I smoke the marijuana and get high
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.380]  Stay above the wicked and fly
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:25.380]  I smoke the marijuana and get high
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:28.380]  Give thanks and praise I desire
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.380]  All in Babylon
[01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:08.330]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff
[01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:10.330]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me
[01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:14.330]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:16.330]  For letting me use their music on my show
[01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:20.330]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew
[01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:25.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, I had to pull myself away from Narcos season 2 to come record a podcast
[01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:29.330]  Shout out to my friend that threw down the Netflix password for me
[01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:32.330]  Now I got me a fresh Netflix account there
[01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:35.330]  Catching up on some Narcos, can't get enough
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:37.330]  Shout out to good old Pablo Escobar
[01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:40.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode I am going to talk about a recent
[01:29:40.330 --> 01:29:46.330]  A cease and desist letter that was sent to all of the cannabis social lounges in Colorado Springs
[01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:51.330]  But before we get to that, I want to answer some emails that were sent to us by some friends
[01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:53.330]  Let's just get right to that part
[01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:56.330]  This one came to the Grow From Your Heart Facebook page
[01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:59.330]  And this one, I don't know if she wants me to say her name on the air
[01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:01.330]  But I am going to read her message
[01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:04.330]  It goes like this, do you have any opinion on trimming machines?
[01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:07.330]  We are home growers, so we are looking for something small
[01:30:07.330 --> 01:30:10.330]  Like the Triminator Mini Dry Trimmer or the smaller TrimPal
[01:30:10.330 --> 01:30:13.330]  But lots of folks are against trimming machines
[01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:17.330]  So I just thought I would ask your expert opinion
[01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:19.330]  Thanks for all the info you share, I love your show
[01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:21.330]  Hey thanks for listening to the podcast
[01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:23.330]  I appreciate when people send me messages
[01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:25.330]  And I love it when people tell me that they love the show
[01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:27.330]  It makes it all worth it
[01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:29.330]  Big shout out, I appreciate that
[01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:32.330]  Let's talk about trim machines
[01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:35.330]  You are not going to like my answer
[01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:37.330]  But there is not a trim machine that I like
[01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:39.330]  I am a fan of hand trimmed cannabis
[01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:43.330]  I think connoisseur grade cannabis should be trimmed by hand
[01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:46.330]  If you are growing a whole bunch, if you have a large outdoor
[01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:48.330]  I might see you using a trim machine
[01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:54.330]  But honestly, I can tell the difference between hand trimmed and machine trimmed cannabis
[01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:57.330]  And there is nothing like hand trimmed cannabis
[01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:59.330]  Why grow your plants?
[01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:02.330]  You are going to have them for 9 weeks in flower
[01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:05.330]  And then 4-6 weeks, maybe 8 weeks in veg
[01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:07.330]  Maybe longer, depending on how you do things
[01:31:07.330 --> 01:31:11.330]  So that is a lot of weeks, 13 weeks, 14, 15, 16 weeks
[01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:12.330]  You have got these plants, right?
[01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:14.330]  Then you are going to cut them down
[01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:17.330]  Why not take the time to trim them by hand and love them?
[01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:19.330]  I know it is tedious and it kind of sucks sometimes
[01:31:19.330 --> 01:31:22.330]  But it is so worth it in my opinion
[01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:24.330]  And then, my big thing is
[01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:27.330]  When you use a machine to trim your cannabis
[01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:29.330]  It turns that trim into like a mulch
[01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:33.330]  And it just makes it, it cuts it at too many different angles
[01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.330]  Too many different times and it makes it
[01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:37.330]  It is basically a mulch
[01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:39.330]  Like when you mow the lawn and you have got that bag of clippings
[01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:41.330]  And it stinks real funky
[01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:43.330]  You have kind of mulched up all of your cannabis leaves
[01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:45.330]  And they are releasing too much moisture
[01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:49.330]  And it is starting to, there is a reaction that is happening in there
[01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.330]  Because it is cut so many times and it is stacked inside of there
[01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:53.330]  And you know how the grass stinks real bad?
[01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:55.330]  Well, your trim will start to do that also
[01:31:55.330 --> 01:31:59.330]  A lot of times when you are getting shitty hash from the dispensary
[01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:01.330]  It was possibly made, I cannot guarantee it
[01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:05.330]  But it was possibly made by material that came from the trim machine
[01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:09.330]  When I helped my buddy Kevin get started making his little hash company
[01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:11.330]  I was a grower, he was an extract guy
[01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:13.330]  I was giving him material
[01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:15.330]  I used a trim machine
[01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:17.330]  I used the kind that looks like a giant salad bowl
[01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:19.330]  And it has got the grill in the middle of it
[01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:21.330]  And you put the top on it and you spin it
[01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:25.330]  That worked, it trimmed the shit out of some of my buds
[01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:27.330]  Some of my buds had just mangled
[01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:29.330]  I grew some cush that was like rocks, it trimmed that okay
[01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:31.330]  I had some lemon skunk that had some fingery buds
[01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:33.330]  It just cut the shit out of those
[01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:35.330]  It did not like that at all
[01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:37.330]  So, where I am getting is
[01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:39.330]  I gave the trim from that to my buddy Kev bro
[01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:41.330]  And he ran and made hash out of it
[01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:43.330]  And the hash was terrible
[01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:45.330]  And we could not figure out why
[01:32:45.330 --> 01:32:47.330]  And we took it to Denver with us one time on a trip
[01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:49.330]  And we showed a friend and my buddy was like
[01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.330]  Dude did you use a trim machine to make this hash
[01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:53.330]  And he called us out right away, he knew
[01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:55.330]  And so it made green shitty hash
[01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:59.330]  So that is one major reason why I do not like a trim machine
[01:32:59.330 --> 01:33:01.330]  I think it should be trimmed by hand
[01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:03.330]  You can trim it by hand and then you can use all of your fine trim
[01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:05.330]  To actually make some product out of it
[01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:07.330]  You can make concentrates, you can make edibles
[01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:09.330]  You can do whatever you want with it
[01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:11.330]  But if you use a machine, it is pretty much wasted
[01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:13.330]  And like I said before
[01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:15.330]  If you are going to put that much time into growing it
[01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:17.330]  And curing it, why not sit around the table
[01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.330]  With whoever is going to smoke it with you
[01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:21.330]  You said we are growers
[01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:23.330]  I am assuming there is you and probably a spouse
[01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:25.330]  Or a partner or whatever you call it these days
[01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:27.330]  And maybe a couple of friends
[01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:29.330]  Maybe a roommate or something
[01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:31.330]  You guys should all sit around the table and trim it up
[01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:33.330]  Talk, have a good time, experience that shit
[01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:35.330]  You probably have but I am saying that is what should happen
[01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:37.330]  In my opinion, I understand it gets overwhelming
[01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:39.330]  There are a lot of great trim machines
[01:33:39.330 --> 01:33:41.330]  But there is not one that I can recommend
[01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:43.330]  Because I stay away from them
[01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:45.330]  I don't want humans to trim
[01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:47.330]  So honestly that is my 100% honest guidance
[01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.330]  On trim machines
[01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:51.330]  If anybody out there has a trim machine
[01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:53.330]  That they think trims to the quality of a hand trimmer
[01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:55.330]  Of a person
[01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.330]  Send me a message, send me a video
[01:33:57.330 --> 01:33:59.330]  I am very open
[01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:01.330]  I want to know about these things
[01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:03.330]  There is shit that I don't know, enlighten me
[01:34:03.330 --> 01:34:05.330]  I would like to be on the knowledge team
[01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:07.330]  So let me know and then I can share that information with the listeners
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:09.330]  Let me know what you think about trim machines
[01:34:09.330 --> 01:34:11.330]  If you have one that can compete with my quality trim
[01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:13.330]  Alright that is the first email
[01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:15.330]  Let's get to another email
[01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:17.330]  This guy sent me
[01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:19.330]  A multi-choice email
[01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:21.330]  And it won't open
[01:34:21.330 --> 01:34:23.330]  But I will make it open
[01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:25.330]  But it won't do it
[01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:27.330]  Hello email
[01:34:27.330 --> 01:34:29.330]  Alright it is broken
[01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:31.330]  This one just says
[01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:33.330]  Podcast topic, the freedom of strains
[01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:35.330]  How do you feel about trading?
[01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:37.330]  Is it legal to ship cuttings to legal states due to low THC content?
[01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:39.330]  So how do I feel about
[01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:41.330]  Trading strains
[01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:43.330]  So if you have a clone and I have a clone
[01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:45.330]  And I want what you have
[01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:47.330]  And vice versa
[01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:49.330]  Like baseball cards, yes I love trading strains
[01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:51.330]  I have gotten some of my
[01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:53.330]  Best strains by trading stuff before
[01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:55.330]  It is like having a good
[01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:57.330]  Baseball card, you know what I mean
[01:34:57.330 --> 01:34:59.330]  That specific cut could be like that
[01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:01.330]  I am not a baseball guy but I listened to enough Greg Proops
[01:35:01.330 --> 01:35:03.330]  To know that a Mickey Mantle card would be worth
[01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.330]  Some shit you know
[01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:07.330]  Or if I had a Satchel Paige baseball card
[01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.330]  I could trade that for a bunch of other cards
[01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:11.330]  So if I have that one good cut
[01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:13.330]  Like back in the day if you had Girl Scout cookies around here
[01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:15.330]  I could trade my Girl Scout cookies forum cut
[01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:17.330]  For almost any cut that anybody had
[01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:19.330]  The Gorilla Glue is very similar
[01:35:19.330 --> 01:35:21.330]  My Grateful Dog
[01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:23.330]  I will not let that out to people
[01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:25.330]  People have offered me ridiculous trades
[01:35:25.330 --> 01:35:27.330]  For my mother plant of my Grateful Dog
[01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:29.330]  I won't let it go however
[01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:31.330]  So yeah I totally love the freedom of trading strains
[01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:35.330]  You should give strains away also
[01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:37.330]  There is nothing wrong with that
[01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:39.330]  I give people clones
[01:35:39.330 --> 01:35:41.330]  I had a friend start a grow recently
[01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:43.330]  I gave them shit tons of clones
[01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:45.330]  Just to get them started
[01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:47.330]  You should give away and trade clones
[01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:49.330]  And seeds that should happen
[01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:51.330]  If you have a pack of seeds
[01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:53.330]  If you have 20 seeds and you only want to run 10
[01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:55.330]  And your buddy has 10 seeds of something else
[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:57.330]  Trade do it get it on
[01:35:57.330 --> 01:35:59.330]  I think that is awesome
[01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:01.330]  Is it legal to ship cuttings to legal states
[01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:03.330]  Due to low THC content
[01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.330]  I don't know the legalities of that
[01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:07.330]  I honestly avoid shipping
[01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:09.330]  I don't like to put anything in the mail
[01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.330]  I'm kind of a paranoid old hippie on that part
[01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:13.330]  So I don't really put anything in the mail
[01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:15.330]  Unless it is absolutely necessary
[01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:17.330]  So I can't speak too much on that
[01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:19.330]  Low THC content
[01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:21.330]  I guess if you are shipping hemp plants
[01:36:21.330 --> 01:36:23.330]  From one legal state to another
[01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:25.330]  That is probably ok
[01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:27.330]  But isn't the shipping system
[01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:29.330]  Isn't that owned by the government
[01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:31.330]  Isn't that federal
[01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:33.330]  Then your question continues with
[01:36:33.330 --> 01:36:35.330]  People slash clubs buying and renaming genetics
[01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:37.330]  Selling breeding rights etc
[01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:39.330]  So let me touch on that one
[01:36:39.330 --> 01:36:41.330]  People and clubs buying and renaming genetics
[01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:43.330]  That sucks
[01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.330]  I really hate it
[01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:47.330]  When I give somebody a clone
[01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:49.330]  And they grow that clone
[01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:51.330]  And I know they harvested it
[01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:53.330]  And a little while later they have a bag of something
[01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:55.330]  That smells exactly like the clone I gave them
[01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:57.330]  Tastes just like it looks just like it
[01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:59.330]  And they are calling it some different shit
[01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:01.330]  Or they want to make some extra money off of it
[01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:03.330]  By calling it something different
[01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:05.330]  That is frustrating shit right there
[01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:07.330]  Call it what it is
[01:37:07.330 --> 01:37:09.330]  Or the clubs will do it also
[01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:11.330]  The clubs
[01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:13.330]  Somebody else will name something
[01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:15.330]  And then we have medical marijuana here in Colorado
[01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:17.330]  And some people really like specific strains
[01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:19.330]  Some people really dislike other strains
[01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:21.330]  And if you know
[01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:23.330]  That
[01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:25.330]  I'm going to say sour diesel
[01:37:25.330 --> 01:37:27.330]  If sour diesel works well for you medicinally
[01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:29.330]  You want to go get sour diesel
[01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:31.330]  And if somebody just named some shit on the shelf
[01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:33.330]  Sour diesel and you go spend your money on it
[01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:35.330]  And you get home and you smoke it
[01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:37.330]  And say you've got Parkinson's
[01:37:37.330 --> 01:37:39.330]  And maybe this is just hypothetical
[01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:41.330]  You've got Parkinson's disease
[01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:43.330]  And sour diesel makes you quit trembling
[01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:45.330]  So you just spent your hard earned money
[01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:47.330]  On this eighth or this quarter of medicine
[01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:49.330]  And you went home
[01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:51.330]  And you probably took all day to get that bowl packed
[01:37:51.330 --> 01:37:53.330]  And you finally smoked that fucker
[01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:55.330]  And you thought you were going to quit shaking
[01:37:55.330 --> 01:37:57.330]  And you probably mislabeled some weed
[01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.330]  Because it would sell if it were called sour diesel
[01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:01.330]  And it's not going to do what you need properly
[01:38:01.330 --> 01:38:03.330]  For your medicinal effect
[01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:05.330]  And you just kind of wasted your money
[01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:07.330]  And you're disappointed
[01:38:07.330 --> 01:38:09.330]  You probably wasted an Uber ride
[01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:11.330]  Or a drive over to the dispensary
[01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:13.330]  That shit sucks when people in clubs buy and rename genetics
[01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:15.330]  That's not really cool
[01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:17.330]  I think that everything needs to be left the proper name
[01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:19.330]  I've seen it done
[01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:21.330]  I try to speak out against it
[01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:23.330]  I really dislike when extract companies
[01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:25.330]  Do different strains
[01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:27.330]  Like right now, I'm not going to call out the brand
[01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:29.330]  But I'm going to talk about what I've got
[01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:31.330]  I've got some Curious George live resin in my hand
[01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:33.330]  I don't know of a strain called Curious George
[01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:35.330]  But there's some bananas
[01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:37.330]  And probably some gorilla glue
[01:38:37.330 --> 01:38:39.330]  Or something, you know what I mean
[01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:41.330]  So they just blended those two strains together
[01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:43.330]  And called it Curious George
[01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:45.330]  Which I mean that's creative
[01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:47.330]  But they didn't breed that
[01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.330]  I guess they get to name that hash blend
[01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:51.330]  But I think it would be better if they put
[01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:53.330]  Terpex printed
[01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:55.330]  Taffy plus cascade
[01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:57.330]  Nug run shatter
[01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:59.330]  They didn't put an X to make you think it's crossed
[01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:01.330]  Because if you put taffy times cascade
[01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:03.330]  It makes it look like
[01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:05.330]  It's a hybrid of that
[01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:07.330]  Because that's how a breeder would do it
[01:39:07.330 --> 01:39:09.330]  So Terpex does it taffy plus cascade
[01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:11.330]  So I know straight up what two strains are in this hash blend
[01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:13.330]  So maybe
[01:39:13.330 --> 01:39:15.330]  I've got a friend who if she smokes too heavy
[01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:17.330]  Of a sativa she will have a panic attack
[01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:19.330]  Right in front of you
[01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:21.330]  She'll cry, she'll have to leave
[01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:23.330]  It gets ridiculous if she smokes too much sativa
[01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.330]  That cascade in there
[01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:27.330]  That would be too much for her head
[01:39:27.330 --> 01:39:29.330]  So she knows straight up not to buy that
[01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:31.330]  This other one it doesn't say what's in there
[01:39:31.330 --> 01:39:33.330]  So she doesn't know if she can even smoke that
[01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:35.330]  So she probably wouldn't even waste her time buying it
[01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:37.330]  To tell you the truth
[01:39:37.330 --> 01:39:39.330]  So yeah it sucks when people rename stuff
[01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:41.330]  I think that we need to keep the names true
[01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:43.330]  I think that Budtenders
[01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:45.330]  Or somebody in the dispensary
[01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:47.330]  I think that the jar should say
[01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:49.330]  And let's say maybe
[01:39:49.330 --> 01:39:51.330]  Maybe they have Lemon Jeffrey on the shelf
[01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:53.330]  I think it should say Lemon Jeffrey
[01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:55.330]  And then it should have a lab test of THC, CBD
[01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:57.330]  Maybe CBN
[01:39:57.330 --> 01:39:59.330]  CBG and THCA
[01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:01.330]  Those need to be listed on there
[01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:03.330]  And then underneath Lemon Jeffrey it needs to tell you the genetics
[01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.330]  Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat
[01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:07.330]  It needs to let you know that that's the parents
[01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:09.330]  I think that would be really helpful
[01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:11.330]  And then it also should have the sativa
[01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:13.330]  Or indica or hybrid marker
[01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:15.330]  Which is a whole other conversation
[01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:17.330]  Because everything is pretty much a hybrid these days
[01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:19.330]  In my opinion
[01:40:19.330 --> 01:40:21.330]  But you can have things that lean toward the indica and the sativa
[01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:23.330]  So that's what I think about people renaming streams
[01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:25.330]  I think it sucks
[01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:27.330]  I think if I give you seeds or clones you better call it that shit
[01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:29.330]  When you grow it just to keep it true
[01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:31.330]  Because what if somebody breeds with it
[01:40:31.330 --> 01:40:33.330]  Then you're really fucking things up
[01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:35.330]  You're really throwing off the family tree
[01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:37.330]  And we gotta keep the cannabis family tree in line
[01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:39.330]  That's part of our job
[01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:41.330]  Myself as a breeder that's really part of my job
[01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:43.330]  Is to keep it true to where there's a history and a family tree
[01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:45.330]  So that we can look back when things get different
[01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.330]  I don't know I just think that's important
[01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:49.330]  I like to be kind of a preservationist I guess
[01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:51.330]  So your email goes on to say
[01:40:51.330 --> 01:40:53.330]  More casts on genetics and origins please
[01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:55.330]  I would like to talk a lot more about genetics and origins
[01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:57.330]  But the only things I would really feel fully comfortable talking about
[01:40:57.330 --> 01:40:59.330]  Would probably be strains that I bred
[01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:01.330]  Because they're the only ones that I would know the true origin of
[01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:03.330]  Because unfortunately a lot of the popular cuts
[01:41:03.330 --> 01:41:05.330]  There's a lot of lies and misinformation and bullshit
[01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:07.330]  Based around
[01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:09.330]  The fact that
[01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:11.330]  There's a lot of people that are
[01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:13.330]  Bullshit based around
[01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:15.330]  The origins of those cuts
[01:41:15.330 --> 01:41:17.330]  We know where Gorilla Glue came from
[01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:19.330]  Because Josie Wales bred that and told us about it
[01:41:19.330 --> 01:41:21.330]  We know where Golden Goat came from
[01:41:21.330 --> 01:41:23.330]  Because Mr. Dank bred that and told us about it
[01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:25.330]  But there are a lot of
[01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.330]  Lies and rumors
[01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:29.330]  And untrue stories about things like
[01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:31.330]  Girl Scout Cookies
[01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:33.330]  And of course the OG Kush
[01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:35.330]  I mean there are probably 20 different stories about OG Kush
[01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:37.330]  That I've heard and I don't want to talk about
[01:41:37.330 --> 01:41:39.330]  Where I think it came from too much
[01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:41.330]  Because I feel like I'm just
[01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:43.330]  Deluding the true story since I really wasn't there
[01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:45.330]  And I don't know
[01:41:45.330 --> 01:41:47.330]  So I'd love to talk more about origins
[01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:49.330]  Maybe one day I'll talk about some of the strains
[01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.330]  That I created since I can tell you
[01:41:51.330 --> 01:41:53.330]  Where they came from and I'm certain of those
[01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:55.330]  And I won't create any
[01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:57.330]  Bullshit stories about it
[01:41:57.330 --> 01:41:59.330]  So I made a note of that
[01:41:59.330 --> 01:42:01.330]  I will talk about that in the future
[01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:03.330]  Alright you guys I want to thank you once again for sending me those messages
[01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:05.330]  That message came from a dude called
[01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:07.330]  That Heavy Slim Guy on Instagram
[01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:09.330]  Big shout out to That Heavy Slim Guy
[01:42:09.330 --> 01:42:11.330]  I appreciate the message
[01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:13.330]  I love getting messages from everybody
[01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:15.330]  If you're going to send me a message I would prefer you shoot it to me
[01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:17.330]  At growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:19.330]  I think the email address
[01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:21.330]  Is the easiest way to keep it organized
[01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:23.330]  It's the most reliable and I will find
[01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:25.330]  Your message there
[01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:27.330]  If we're already corresponding on Facebook or Instagram
[01:42:27.330 --> 01:42:29.330]  Or wherever we might be talking
[01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:31.330]  Just keep sending me your messages there
[01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:33.330]  We'll continue the conversation there
[01:42:33.330 --> 01:42:35.330]  But if you want to start a new conversation
[01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:37.330]  Hit me up at growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[01:42:39.330 --> 01:42:41.330]  I really do like making content
[01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.330]  From all the messages I receive from the listeners
[01:42:43.330 --> 01:42:45.330]  It lets me know that I'm hitting my target audience
[01:42:45.330 --> 01:42:47.330]  It lets me know I'm talking about something you guys want to hear about
[01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:49.330]  And it always gives me good content
[01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.330]  So I appreciate that, thank you guys
[01:42:51.330 --> 01:42:53.330]  Now at the start of the show I did say
[01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:55.330]  I was going to talk about
[01:42:55.330 --> 01:42:57.330]  The Cannabis Clubs in Colorado Springs
[01:42:57.330 --> 01:42:59.330]  Receiving a cease and desist letter
[01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:01.330]  I'm pulling up a website now
[01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:03.330]  I'm pulling up the Denver Post website
[01:43:03.330 --> 01:43:05.330]  And this article comes from the Colorado Springs Gazette
[01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:07.330]  They do not give an author name
[01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:11.330]  So we will get into the article
[01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:13.330]  I like to give credit but there's no one to give credit here
[01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:15.330]  Besides the Denver Post and the Springs Gazette
[01:43:15.330 --> 01:43:17.330]  So the article goes like this
[01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:19.330]  Nine Colorado Springs Cannabis Consumption Clubs
[01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:21.330]  Received cease and desist letters
[01:43:21.330 --> 01:43:23.330]  From the city clerks office
[01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.330]  Last week in the first crackdown
[01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:27.330]  Under a ban on the clubs enacted by the city council
[01:43:27.330 --> 01:43:29.330]  On March 22nd
[01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:31.330]  The club sprang up after
[01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:33.330]  Amendment 64 was passed in 2012
[01:43:33.330 --> 01:43:35.330]  Legalizing adult sales
[01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:37.330]  And use of recreational marijuana
[01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:39.330]  But banning public consumption
[01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:41.330]  The clubs gave people a place to use cannabis
[01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:43.330]  And socialize in private
[01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:45.330]  Colorado Springs outlawed
[01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:47.330]  Sales of recreational marijuana in the city
[01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:49.330]  But the clubs got around the ban
[01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:51.330]  By providing pot to their patrons for a reimbursement model
[01:43:51.330 --> 01:43:53.330]  They could either trade
[01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:55.330]  Cannabis for membership or sign affidavits
[01:43:55.330 --> 01:43:57.330]  Saying the club was growing the customers
[01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:59.330]  Legally allowed six marijuana
[01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:01.330]  Plants for them
[01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:03.330]  Alright now let me back up and talk about a couple of things
[01:44:03.330 --> 01:44:05.330]  On here. Colorado Springs outlawed
[01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:07.330]  Sales of recreational marijuana in the city
[01:44:07.330 --> 01:44:09.330]  Of Colorado Springs
[01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:11.330]  When we did pass recreational marijuana
[01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:13.330]  Counties were allowed, counties and cities were allowed
[01:44:13.330 --> 01:44:15.330]  To decide if they wanted recreational
[01:44:15.330 --> 01:44:17.330]  Marijuana dispensaries in their county
[01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:19.330]  Or not and a lot of places said
[01:44:19.330 --> 01:44:21.330]  No, Denver has a lot of
[01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:23.330]  Recreational marijuana available
[01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:25.330]  Pueblo has recreational cannabis available
[01:44:25.330 --> 01:44:27.330]  Colorado Springs is right in the middle
[01:44:27.330 --> 01:44:29.330]  And they banned it
[01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:31.330]  So the way that the city got around it
[01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:33.330]  Or the way that people got around it
[01:44:33.330 --> 01:44:35.330]  Was by opening up these cannabis clubs
[01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:37.330]  And working on what they called here the reimbursement model
[01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:39.330]  Which means you can sign a paper
[01:44:39.330 --> 01:44:41.330]  That says you're a member
[01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:43.330]  You probably pay a cover charge
[01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:45.330]  Then you can walk into that club
[01:44:45.330 --> 01:44:47.330]  And if they've got some cannabis and you want to smoke it
[01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:49.330]  They won't sell it to you
[01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:51.330]  They'll give it to you but you've got to reimburse them
[01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:53.330]  For the electricity that they spent
[01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:55.330]  And the time that somebody spent trimming it
[01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:57.330]  You've got to reimburse them
[01:44:57.330 --> 01:44:59.330]  The way that they made that legal
[01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:01.330]  Was these people would sign over
[01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:03.330]  Their legal plant count
[01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:05.330]  So in Colorado when you get a medical marijuana card
[01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:07.330]  You are allowed six plants
[01:45:07.330 --> 01:45:09.330]  You can pay
[01:45:09.330 --> 01:45:11.330]  A larger fee or you can talk to your doctor
[01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:13.330]  And he may give you what's called an elevated plant count
[01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:15.330]  Where you can grow more plants
[01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:17.330]  They will offer up to 99 plants
[01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:19.330]  In some cases but
[01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:21.330]  You'll take your medical marijuana paperwork
[01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:23.330]  And there's a spot where you sign your provider
[01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:25.330]  And you will make
[01:45:25.330 --> 01:45:27.330]  Whoever runs this cannabis club
[01:45:27.330 --> 01:45:29.330]  Would now become your provider
[01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:31.330]  And now that place is legally
[01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:33.330]  Pseudo kind of allowed
[01:45:33.330 --> 01:45:35.330]  To grow your six plants for you
[01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:37.330]  And when you go there
[01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:39.330]  You walk in and you're already a member there
[01:45:39.330 --> 01:45:41.330]  They're growing your plants
[01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:43.330]  So you're able to consume products that are there on site
[01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:45.330]  This is how it was
[01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:47.330]  It's no longer like this since they came and made these new rules
[01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:49.330]  And sent this cease and desist letter
[01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:51.330]  But this is how it used to work
[01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:53.330]  So I'm going to continue with the article
[01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:55.330]  It says although the city officials view such actions
[01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:57.330]  As de facto sales
[01:45:57.330 --> 01:45:59.330]  The practice has continued
[01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:01.330]  The ban passed in March however says the clubs cannot sell
[01:46:01.330 --> 01:46:03.330]  Trade, give, distribute
[01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:05.330]  Or allow the transfer
[01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:07.330]  Of marijuana
[01:46:07.330 --> 01:46:09.330]  So they're technically not allowed to be reimbursed
[01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:11.330]  Or sell or trade cannabis in there
[01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:13.330]  They cannot give cannabis away
[01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:15.330]  Which is kind of weird
[01:46:15.330 --> 01:46:17.330]  Because what's a cannabis social club without cannabis
[01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:19.330]  It doesn't say that we can't consume it in there right now
[01:46:19.330 --> 01:46:21.330]  But that was part of what they
[01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:23.330]  Part of the new rules was we couldn't consume in there
[01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:25.330]  So I'll continue with the article
[01:46:25.330 --> 01:46:27.330]  It says the ban gave clubs that existed before September 23rd 2015
[01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:29.330]  Eight years to phase out their businesses
[01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:31.330]  In an effort to help the owners protect their investment
[01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:33.330]  But under the law
[01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:35.330]  Every owner had to submit a consumption club application
[01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:37.330]  And a $200 fee by April 29th
[01:46:37.330 --> 01:46:39.330]  To get a one year renewable license
[01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:41.330]  For $90 plus registration fees
[01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:43.330]  Only five clubs applied
[01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:45.330]  And the ban was lifted
[01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:47.330]  The club was approved
[01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:49.330]  Two were under consideration
[01:46:49.330 --> 01:46:51.330]  And two were denied
[01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:53.330]  The denied clubs along with seven other identified clubs
[01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:55.330]  That did not apply for licensing
[01:46:55.330 --> 01:46:57.330]  Have been ordered to close
[01:46:57.330 --> 01:46:59.330]  Because they are not licensed as required
[01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:01.330]  Now guys I talk about this a lot
[01:47:01.330 --> 01:47:03.330]  Every time I talk about cannabis consumption clubs
[01:47:03.330 --> 01:47:05.330]  We talk about the Canna Canyon or the Dab Lounge
[01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:07.330]  I talk about this all the time
[01:47:07.330 --> 01:47:09.330]  When you are writing legislation for your area
[01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:11.330]  If your state or your locality
[01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:13.330]  Is in violation of the cannabis consumption law
[01:47:13.330 --> 01:47:15.330]  If your state or your locality
[01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:17.330]  Is inventing and writing and creating the laws
[01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:19.330]  For medical or recreational cannabis
[01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:21.330]  In your area or any type of cannabis use
[01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:23.330]  In your area
[01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:25.330]  Please include some type of safe smoking area
[01:47:25.330 --> 01:47:27.330]  You need a consumption club
[01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:29.330]  You need a place where adults can go
[01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:31.330]  And congregate and consume cannabis safely
[01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:33.330]  Like adults
[01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:35.330]  There are people that come from all over the world
[01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:37.330]  To Colorado
[01:47:37.330 --> 01:47:39.330]  Anybody 21 and over can drive to Denver or Pueblo
[01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:41.330]  And they can show an ID
[01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:43.330]  And if they have some money they can buy some cannabis
[01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:45.330]  Now once they leave that dispensary
[01:47:45.330 --> 01:47:47.330]  There is nowhere safe for them to consume that
[01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:49.330]  You can't smoke in your car
[01:47:49.330 --> 01:47:51.330]  Because you will get a DUI
[01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:53.330]  Oh excuse me I'm coughing
[01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:55.330]  You can't smoke at the park because that is illegal
[01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.330]  You can't roll up a joint and walk down the street
[01:47:57.330 --> 01:47:59.330]  And safely smoke in Colorado
[01:47:59.330 --> 01:48:01.330]  That is frowned upon that is not what we did here
[01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:03.330]  So there is nowhere practical or safe
[01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:05.330]  To smoke the cannabis you just bought at the dispensary
[01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:07.330]  You can go to your hotel
[01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:09.330]  And a lot of hotels make you sign a paper
[01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:11.330]  When you check in and it says that they will charge you
[01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:13.330]  $250 to $500
[01:48:13.330 --> 01:48:15.330]  For cleaning your room
[01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:17.330]  If you smoke cannabis in there
[01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:19.330]  Because they think you are going to fuck that room up
[01:48:19.330 --> 01:48:21.330]  $250 to $500 worth of stink
[01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:23.330]  You better have some good weed
[01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.330]  If it costs $500 to get the smell out of that hotel room
[01:48:25.330 --> 01:48:27.330]  So there is nowhere practical to smoke
[01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:29.330]  We need these consumption places you guys
[01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:31.330]  So when you are writing this legislation
[01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:33.330]  And writing the rules please be sure to include that
[01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:35.330]  Because that is where we screwed up here in Colorado
[01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:37.330]  We would have it pretty well pretty good
[01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:39.330]  If we didn't skip that part
[01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:41.330]  Now what really sucks you guys
[01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:43.330]  Is I am passionate about this
[01:48:43.330 --> 01:48:45.330]  Because a couple of my friends own these businesses
[01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:47.330]  But I feel for every owner
[01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:49.330]  How are my friends that were promised 8 years
[01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:51.330]  To continue doing business to recoup their assets
[01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:53.330]  Or recoup their investments
[01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:55.330]  How are they expected to pay their bills
[01:48:55.330 --> 01:48:57.330]  Now that they are not allowed to work on the business model
[01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.330]  That they have designed and been operating on
[01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:01.330]  They are not allowed to reimburse for cannabis
[01:49:01.330 --> 01:49:03.330]  They are not allowed to give it away
[01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:05.330]  They are not allowed to trade it
[01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:07.330]  There is no transaction involved for cannabis
[01:49:07.330 --> 01:49:09.330]  Which honestly was a large portion of these people's revenue
[01:49:09.330 --> 01:49:11.330]  Now how are they going to pay the rent
[01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:13.330]  As I am recording the first is creeping up on us
[01:49:13.330 --> 01:49:15.330]  And I know hopefully these businesses have more than one month of finances put aside
[01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:17.330]  But you never know
[01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:19.330]  This is the cannabis industry
[01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:21.330]  They have to buy products
[01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:23.330]  They have to pay vendors
[01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:25.330]  They have to keep the lights on
[01:49:25.330 --> 01:49:27.330]  Apparently some of them are growing products somewhere
[01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:29.330]  Which cost money
[01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:31.330]  You have to pay to grow
[01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:33.330]  You have to pay trimmers
[01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:35.330]  Everything will cost money
[01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:37.330]  Everything costs money when you are doing business
[01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:39.330]  Making money costs a shit ton of money
[01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:41.330]  Money is expensive
[01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:43.330]  How are these folks
[01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:45.330]  How are my friends
[01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:47.330]  How is our community going to pay their rent
[01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:49.330]  Now that they are not allowed to function under their business plan
[01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:51.330]  I do not find it fair
[01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:53.330]  I hope that we can do something about this
[01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:55.330]  I would rally you guys for a city council meeting
[01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:57.330]  But it has already happened
[01:49:57.330 --> 01:49:59.330]  If you are in Colorado Springs
[01:49:59.330 --> 01:50:01.330]  Please go to the city council meetings
[01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:03.330]  We are allowed to have bars on every other corner
[01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:05.330]  Where people can go
[01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:07.330]  And drink whiskey and beer all day
[01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:09.330]  And get shitted and cause problems
[01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:11.330]  But we are not allowed to have a place
[01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:13.330]  Where people can go and consume some cannabis peacefully
[01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:15.330]  I do not find it to be fair
[01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:17.330]  The Colorado model says let's regulate cannabis like alcohol
[01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:19.330]  So let's do that
[01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:21.330]  Shit
[01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:23.330]  If we are going to do that
[01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:25.330]  How about when we are at a baseball game or a football game or a basketball game
[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:27.330]  Why don't we have a medical marijuana smoking section
[01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:29.330]  Or a recreational marijuana smoking section
[01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:31.330]  Right next to the smoking section
[01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:33.330]  If we are going to regulate like alcohol
[01:50:33.330 --> 01:50:35.330]  Let's step up and do it correctly
[01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:37.330]  Alright you guys
[01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.330]  I have been ranting for a long time
[01:50:39.330 --> 01:50:41.330]  I really hope that you show some support
[01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:43.330]  For these cannabis clubs
[01:50:43.330 --> 01:50:45.330]  And I want to give a huge shout out to all of the cannabis club owners
[01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:47.330]  And proprietors and everybody who works with the clubs
[01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:49.330]  To make them happen
[01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:51.330]  I appreciate you and I respect you
[01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:53.330]  And shout out
[01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:55.330]  I hope that you are able to continue doing business
[01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:57.330]  And I hope you guys all survive
[01:50:57.330 --> 01:50:59.330]  And probably you have families
[01:50:59.330 --> 01:51:01.330]  You at least have a damn dog and a house to take care of
[01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:03.330]  That shit is expensive
[01:51:03.330 --> 01:51:05.330]  I hope you find a means to do it
[01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:07.330]  I hope it all works out for you
[01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:09.330]  Okay I want to wrap up the podcast with another message
[01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:11.330]  This one comes from yearofthegorilla on Instagram
[01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:13.330]  Year of the Gorilla
[01:51:13.330 --> 01:51:15.330]  Was the winner of the hashtag mullet challenge
[01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:17.330]  I don't know if anybody listened to that episode
[01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:19.330]  But I did the mullet challenge
[01:51:19.330 --> 01:51:21.330]  You had to find somebody in their pajamas at a Walmart
[01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:23.330]  With a mullet and snap a picture and send it to me
[01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:25.330]  This dude followed all of the instructions
[01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:27.330]  He meets the criteria
[01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:29.330]  Shout out to yearofthegorilla
[01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:31.330]  You've got some stickers coming your way
[01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:33.330]  By the time this episode comes out the stickers will be in the mail
[01:51:33.330 --> 01:51:35.330]  The check's in the mail buddy
[01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:37.330]  So he also sent me a message
[01:51:37.330 --> 01:51:39.330]  It says hey Rasta Jeff I was wondering if you have any favorite pest management routines
[01:51:39.330 --> 01:51:41.330]  Like products you use and applications
[01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:43.330]  And how often
[01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:45.330]  I know having a clean grow and proper environmental control
[01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:47.330]  Play a key role in keeping things healthy and happy
[01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:49.330]  Also
[01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:51.330]  Maybe what would you do if an outbreak occurs
[01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:53.330]  And how to stay positive
[01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:55.330]  And overcome challenges in the grow
[01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:57.330]  Now the first part of that
[01:51:57.330 --> 01:51:59.330]  Talking about
[01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:01.330]  Pest management routines and the products that I use
[01:52:01.330 --> 01:52:03.330]  That'll be another episode
[01:52:03.330 --> 01:52:05.330]  I'm writing an episode
[01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:07.330]  I've got notes for it
[01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:09.330]  I've got a notebook filled with notes
[01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:11.330]  A lot of people probably wouldn't believe how many notes I've got
[01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:13.330]  How many half shows I've got
[01:52:13.330 --> 01:52:15.330]  I've got a lot of stuff prepared
[01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:17.330]  But I'm doing an episode on how to identify problems
[01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:19.330]  And how to treat for problems
[01:52:19.330 --> 01:52:21.330]  And how to prevent problems
[01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:23.330]  On the list of things we're going to talk about
[01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:25.330]  I've got spider mites, white flies
[01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:27.330]  Fungus gnats, thrips
[01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:29.330]  So that's just the top of the list
[01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:31.330]  We're going to talk about how to identify those on your plants
[01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:33.330]  We'll talk about all the pest management stuff
[01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:35.330]  But what I want to get to
[01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:37.330]  In this part of this message is
[01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:39.330]  How do you
[01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:41.330]  Also maybe what to do if an outbreak occurs
[01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:43.330]  And how to stay positive
[01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:45.330]  And overcome challenges in your grow
[01:52:45.330 --> 01:52:47.330]  Because that is super important
[01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:49.330]  I see a lot of people have a problem at the beginning of the grow
[01:52:49.330 --> 01:52:51.330]  Just not too far in
[01:52:51.330 --> 01:52:53.330]  And they get completely frustrated
[01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:55.330]  And they feel defeated from the very beginning
[01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:57.330]  And it feels like they're fighting an uphill battle
[01:52:57.330 --> 01:52:59.330]  Cannabis is a plant that wants to survive
[01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:01.330]  Cannabis is hard to kill
[01:53:01.330 --> 01:53:03.330]  You have to almost try to kill cannabis
[01:53:03.330 --> 01:53:05.330]  So if you get a problem
[01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:07.330]  You have to first identify the problem
[01:53:07.330 --> 01:53:09.330]  Right? That's what you have to do
[01:53:09.330 --> 01:53:11.330]  Then you have to figure out
[01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:13.330]  How to solve that problem
[01:53:13.330 --> 01:53:15.330]  Then you have to put that plan into action
[01:53:15.330 --> 01:53:17.330]  And solve your problem
[01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:19.330]  And then your problem will be solved
[01:53:19.330 --> 01:53:21.330]  And then if you do it right
[01:53:21.330 --> 01:53:23.330]  You have a stronger sense of pride
[01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:25.330]  Because you overcame something
[01:53:25.330 --> 01:53:27.330]  Anybody can put some plants in some soil
[01:53:27.330 --> 01:53:29.330]  Pour some nutrients and some water on them
[01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:31.330]  Put them under some lights and let them grow
[01:53:31.330 --> 01:53:33.330]  For 9 or 12 weeks
[01:53:33.330 --> 01:53:35.330]  And produce some cannabis
[01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:37.330]  It's when you have a problem that you had to overcome
[01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.330]  Is when it's really
[01:53:39.330 --> 01:53:41.330]  It makes it more fun for a guy like myself I guess
[01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:43.330]  Maybe that's how I stay positive
[01:53:43.330 --> 01:53:45.330]  I enjoy a challenge
[01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:47.330]  I don't have a mundane boring life at all
[01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:49.330]  That's why I do what I do
[01:53:49.330 --> 01:53:51.330]  That's why I live the way that I live
[01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:53.330]  I honestly think that causing some problems
[01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:55.330]  And screwing up makes you a better grower
[01:53:55.330 --> 01:53:57.330]  You have to
[01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:59.330]  I mean you didn't learn how to walk
[01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:01.330]  Until you fell down a few times
[01:54:01.330 --> 01:54:03.330]  And then you didn't learn how to run
[01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:05.330]  Until you were good at walking
[01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:07.330]  And then you fucked up running a few times
[01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:09.330]  And scraped up your knees
[01:54:09.330 --> 01:54:11.330]  You have to kind of make some mistakes and overcome them
[01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:13.330]  That's how I stay positive
[01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:15.330]  I know that there's something going to come out of
[01:54:15.330 --> 01:54:17.330]  That mistake that I made
[01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:19.330]  So that's how I stay positive
[01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:21.330]  And also man, you're growing cannabis
[01:54:21.330 --> 01:54:23.330]  You can't get too upset
[01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:25.330]  About what you did because you're growing cannabis
[01:54:25.330 --> 01:54:27.330]  If you've got a problem, maybe you've got spider mites
[01:54:27.330 --> 01:54:29.330]  That happens
[01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:31.330]  First you have to accept it
[01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:33.330]  Because shit happens
[01:54:33.330 --> 01:54:35.330]  And you made a mistake somewhere
[01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:37.330]  Maybe there's a crack in the wall that spider mites climbed through
[01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:39.330]  It might not even really be something you could have thought about
[01:54:39.330 --> 01:54:41.330]  Or could have done anything about
[01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:43.330]  Okay, accept it
[01:54:43.330 --> 01:54:45.330]  Get on the internet
[01:54:45.330 --> 01:54:47.330]  Text Rasta Jeff, do whatever you gotta do
[01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:49.330]  Listen to a podcast, figure out how to get rid of those spider mites
[01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:51.330]  If you're in whatever week, don't panic
[01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:53.330]  Whatever week you're in, don't panic
[01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:55.330]  There's a solution
[01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:57.330]  Worst case scenario, harvest
[01:54:57.330 --> 01:54:59.330]  Flush your plants and harvest them
[01:54:59.330 --> 01:55:01.330]  Just flush them out more quickly than those bugs can eat them
[01:55:01.330 --> 01:55:03.330]  Harvest it and get what you can out of the crop
[01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:05.330]  You're gonna get something
[01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:07.330]  Even if it's just experience, you're gonna get something
[01:55:07.330 --> 01:55:09.330]  So find what you've got
[01:55:09.330 --> 01:55:11.330]  Identify it
[01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:13.330]  Then take the steps to get rid of it
[01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:15.330]  And then clean up the grow room
[01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:17.330]  And go back at it harder than ever before
[01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:19.330]  And next time when you see the very warning of spider mites
[01:55:19.330 --> 01:55:21.330]  In that room
[01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:23.330]  You're gonna know exactly what to do
[01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:25.330]  You're gonna identify it more quickly
[01:55:25.330 --> 01:55:27.330]  You're just gonna be better at it
[01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:29.330]  I know that part of me will always know that I'm bigger than every bug
[01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:31.330]  And I can find some sort of thing to destroy any insect that gets into my room
[01:55:31.330 --> 01:55:33.330]  And I've got books that can show me how to get rid of any sort of mold or anything
[01:55:33.330 --> 01:55:35.330]  So I'm just confident that I can get rid of spider mites
[01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:37.330]  And I'm gonna be better at it
[01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:39.330]  I'm just confident that I can take down any problem that I'm given in a grow room
[01:55:39.330 --> 01:55:41.330]  I've had some crazy shit happen in grow rooms before
[01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:43.330]  I've had fans fall and chop up plants
[01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:45.330]  And lights have come undone
[01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:47.330]  And I've ran commercial grows
[01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:49.330]  So there's a lot of stuff that can go wrong
[01:55:49.330 --> 01:55:51.330]  I've had PVC pipes with
[01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:53.330]  Oh I forgot how many gallons per minute this pump used to push
[01:55:53.330 --> 01:55:55.330]  But way too many gallons of water
[01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:57.330]  This PVC pipe exploded
[01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:59.330]  Water went everywhere
[01:55:59.330 --> 01:56:01.330]  So I've had a lot of crazy shit happen in a grow room
[01:56:01.330 --> 01:56:03.330]  You just gotta smile
[01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:05.330]  You gotta put some reggae music on
[01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:07.330]  You gotta turn up the headphones
[01:56:07.330 --> 01:56:09.330]  You gotta laugh, maybe go take a couple dabs
[01:56:09.330 --> 01:56:11.330]  And just get in there and solve the problem
[01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:13.330]  It's just like anything else in life
[01:56:13.330 --> 01:56:15.330]  Shit's gonna happen all the time, every day
[01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:17.330]  Life would be way too easy if shit went right all the time
[01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:19.330]  So I expect problems in a grow room
[01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:21.330]  Actually when I ran the big grow
[01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:23.330]  And I was training new people
[01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:25.330]  They would always say
[01:56:25.330 --> 01:56:27.330]  So what's the first thing you gotta do when you get here
[01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:29.330]  And I would always say find the surprise
[01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:31.330]  And they'd be like what do you mean
[01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:33.330]  And I'd be like well that's a big ass grow
[01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:35.330]  You got like 50 fans
[01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:37.330]  There's a bunch of pumps, there's a bunch of PVC
[01:56:37.330 --> 01:56:39.330]  So we get to find what
[01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:41.330]  Fucked up overnight while we were gone
[01:56:41.330 --> 01:56:43.330]  Cause it's been like 12 hours since we've been here
[01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:45.330]  And so everybody just laughed at first
[01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:47.330]  And they'd really realize like oh yeah everyday when we get in here
[01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:49.330]  There's some weird shit that we have to find
[01:56:49.330 --> 01:56:51.330]  And we have to repair or handle
[01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:53.330]  Before we can even go about normal business
[01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:55.330]  So it's up to you
[01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:57.330]  You can either laugh it off
[01:56:57.330 --> 01:56:59.330]  And just have a good time
[01:56:59.330 --> 01:57:01.330]  And clean it up, move on
[01:57:01.330 --> 01:57:03.330]  Do whatever you gotta do
[01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:05.330]  Or you can have a stroke about it and be pissed off all day
[01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:07.330]  That's up to you but I choose to just have a good time
[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:09.330]  Remember that I'm growing cannabis
[01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:11.330]  There's no need to really get too mad about too much
[01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:13.330]  Alright so thanks for that message
[01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:15.330]  I appreciate that

[01:57:31.330 --> 01:57:33.330]  And uh

[01:58:59.030 --> 01:59:01.030]  No matter what the crisis is

[01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:09.030]  Well every time you take a little look up on the TV
[01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:11.030]  Seems like the whole world gone crazy
[01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:13.030]  War, famine
[01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:15.030]  And poverty
[01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:17.030]  People are dying continually
[01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:19.030]  So many people are getting confused
[01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:21.030]  So many reasons to
[01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:23.030]  Down in the blues
[01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:25.030]  But with a little faith in the more sight

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:25.880]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.880]  That's right.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:29.880]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:33.880]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:37.880]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.880]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeffo, and I thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.880]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.880]  Big shout to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, to my left, a repeat offender.
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:56.880]  Welcome back to the show, Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:57.880]  Welcome back, honey.
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:58.880]  Thank you for having me.
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.880]  Also, right in front of me, he's usually white Mike, but today he's kind of red.
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:03.880]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.880]  What's up, everybody?
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:05.880]  How you doing, bud?
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:07.880]  Mike took a dab, coughed for about 15, 20 minutes.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.880]  I still got half a cough cooking.
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:10.880]  Turn red.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.880]  Feel free to cough.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.880]  The coughs make you feel like people are there with us.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.880]  There you go.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:14.880]  Let it fly, bro.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.880]  Let it fly.
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:16.880]  Let it fly.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:17.880]  Welcome to the table, folks.
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:18.880]  Let it go.
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:19.880]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:21.880]  In this podcast, we are going to talk about some new purchase limits here in Colorado.
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.880]  We have been restricted, we've been restricted, we've been restricted.
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.880]  New rules coming down.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.880]  We've been restricted.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:28.880]  Sorry, remix.
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:32.880]  We've been restricted on how much hash we can purchase here in Colorado.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:37.880]  Also, they've changed some rules on some edibles and also in Oregon, they have banned
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:38.880]  some popular strain names.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.880]  We'll get to that in just a minute.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  First, let's talk a little bit about the secret sesh.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880]  I was at the secret sesh on Friday.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:45.880]  Lindsay was also there.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.880]  Mike couldn't make it.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.880]  He had much more important things to handle.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:53.880]  I finally am not working for a secret sesh and it's the wife's birthday.
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:54.880]  Happy birthday to the wife.
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:55.880]  Thanks, secret sesh.
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:56.880]  A secret sesh happens every month.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:58.880]  Wife's birthday is only once a year.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:00.880]  Once a month, thank God.
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.880]  Not once a year, it was fun.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:04.880]  Had a good night.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:05.880]  Happy birthday to the wife.
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:08.880]  I know it's late, but still better late than never.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:09.880]  Happy birthday, baby.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:10.880]  Yeah.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:15.880]  Lindsay and I and a whole bunch of other people had the pleasure of attending the secret sesh.
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:16.880]  What did you think about the sesh?
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:19.880]  Honestly, I had a lot of fun at this one.
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:23.880]  We kind of squatted up a little bit on some couches.
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:24.880]  Invaded some space.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.880]  Yeah, took over some tables.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.880]  Yeah, there weren't enough tables.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.880]  A bunch of people brought super fancy glass.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:34.880]  The dino, what was the dino, Joe P. collab.
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:39.880]  Yeah, Ty had his elbow Joe Peters collab.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:40.880]  Super snazzy.
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:46.880]  Yeah, and then Max had his Matt Robinson.
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:48.880]  I don't know, is that a collab?
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:49.880]  I'm lost.
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:50.880]  The thing was gorgeous.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.880]  I have no idea who made it, but it was beautiful.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:53.880]  I know the shape of it is Matt Robinson.
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:54.880]  I think it's a collab.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.880]  I'd have to re-look that up.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:58.880]  It was a green giraffe?
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.880]  I bet you Brett and Chris are both listening to this episode screaming,
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:04.880]  it's a collab with so and so.
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:07.880]  Either way, whoever made it, both of those pieces were fancy fresh.
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:10.880]  And these dudes pull out these fancy rigs and there's no table.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.880]  Yeah, it was like a heady zoo and there's nowhere for the zoo to like.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:15.880]  So we had some staff find some table space for us.
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:18.880]  We made a little bit of table space, threw some hash down.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:20.880]  We got down pretty well.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:21.880]  We got down.
[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:24.880]  Big shout out to Ty for that huge ass dab.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.880]  You can catch that on my Instagram.
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:28.880]  That was.
[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:30.880]  That was the first time I got to hang out with Ty, that dude's a soldier.
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:32.880]  Yo, Ty is insane.
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:37.880]  Big shout out to Earl Tycoon on Instagram and THC Chocolates,
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.880]  which is his edible company as well.
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:40.880]  Nice.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:41.880]  He threw me some stickers.
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.880]  So big shout out.
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.880]  I got those stickers.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:44.880]  They're going to go on something cool.
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:45.880]  Probably a case of some sort.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.880]  I got some of his edibles at the house.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:48.880]  I'll let you have a few.
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.880]  Edibles, edibles.
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:51.880]  Well, speaking of edibles, that's a good segue.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:52.880]  Sorry.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:53.880]  At the secret stash.
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:54.880]  I like it.
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:56.880]  I like it when you do that for me at the secret sesh.
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:58.880]  Our good friend, Max sat down next to us.
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.880]  I've been trying not to say good friend.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:01.880]  Remember a long time ago.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:02.880]  I was going to say good friend.
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:06.880]  Our friend, Max, from TNC Extractions sat down next to me at the secret sesh.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:08.880]  And he knows I don't eat bacon,
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:12.880]  and he's felt bad for offering me medicated bacon at all the past sessions.
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:18.880]  So he pulls out a banana pudding Schumet bar.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.880]  It's 100 milligrams of THC, and he hands this to me.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.880]  He's like, here, bro, you want this?
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:23.880]  And I was like, oh, you know what?
[02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:28.880]  I haven't eaten edibles in it's been four or five months since I had eaten edibles.
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:29.880]  Yeah.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:32.880]  And I broke that banana pudding bar in half, and I ate half of it.
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.880]  Did a little selfie video with Miss Lindsay here, and I passed the other half of it to Lindsay.
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:37.880]  I think she split it with Bobo.
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:38.880]  I did.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:41.880]  So I am back on the edibles wagon.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:42.880]  I eat edibles again.
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:46.880]  At the secret sesh, which was Friday, I ate the banana pudding bar.
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:51.880]  I ate a couple of little smaller edibles that people gave me, like candies and such, like a caramel or something.
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:54.880]  Oh, and then I ate something else that we're going to talk about later on in the show.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:00.880]  And then Saturday, I ate a 100 milligram Clottie Bear, a cherry one.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:05.880]  Honestly, not to diss any Clottie Bears, but the cherry are absolutely not my favorite flavor.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:06.880]  I didn't like the cherry one.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:09.880]  It had a little bit of a medicine-y, funky aftertaste.
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:13.880]  The cherry that a lot of the candy companies use has that, ooh, medicine.
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:14.880]  Yeah.
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:15.880]  Yeah.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:16.880]  I didn't prefer.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:17.880]  I like the root beer.
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:18.880]  It's fucking delicious.
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:19.880]  They've got an apple one that's really good.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:22.880]  I like the ones that they have, like a raspberry that they actually dip in chocolate.
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:23.880]  Those are fucking delicious.
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:26.880]  But the cherry didn't, it got me high as shit.
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:29.880]  I slept like a baby, but I did not like the flavor.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.880]  I wouldn't buy that one again.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:41.880]  Then today, I ate from Gaia's Garden Edibles, I ate a 100 milligram milk chocolate cherry truffle, which was quite delicious.
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:42.880]  Sounds amazing.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.880]  And I had to go slow to try to say what that was because it is obviously working on me.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:47.880]  I can feel it.
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:48.880]  Shout out to those guys.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:49.880]  That was a delicious edible.
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:50.880]  So I'm back in the edibles game.
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:56.880]  I got to go slowly because I catch myself just becoming way over-medicated on the edibles.
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:57.880]  I can't do that to myself again.
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:00.880]  I don't want to get all fucking ruined and slow on edibles.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:02.880]  So Secret Session was a great time.
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:03.880]  Shout out to everybody that hung out.
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:04.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:11.880]  Brett, Max, and Ty for sure, them three, and Twisty as well.
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:12.880]  Twisty is where I was headed.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:13.880]  Yep.
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:14.880]  Yeah, Twisty.
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.880]  And then what's the dude-
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:16.880]  And Dwayne.
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:17.880]  And Dwayne.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:18.880]  Absolutely.
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:19.880]  That's the dude whose name I did not know.
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:20.880]  Yes, Dwayne.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:21.880]  So now I know everybody's name.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:22.880]  Nice.
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:23.880]  Yes.
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:24.880]  We had a nice little crew there.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.880]  Yeah.
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:26.880]  Uncle Stoner hung out with us a little bit.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:27.880]  The dude in the vest that was filming everything, that's Uncle Stoner.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:28.880]  He's kind of well-known.
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:29.880]  He's got his own show.
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:30.880]  Check him out if you're interested.
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:31.880]  Yeah.
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:32.880]  There were a lot of cool people.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:33.880]  Adam Mill came and hung out with our little squad and took some dabs.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:34.880]  Absolutely.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:35.880]  Big shout out to Adam.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:36.880]  Adam Mill holds it down.
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:37.880]  He's a really cool host.
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:38.880]  He's the kind of host that'll...
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.880]  There was a band playing, and as the band played, he just came and kicked it with us, rolled
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.880]  the backwood, hung out with us, took some dabs with the crew, flirted with a couple
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:42.880]  of chicks, and then skedaddled right on.
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:43.880]  Yeah.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:44.880]  Shout out to Hunt.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:45.880]  Hunt throws a hell of a party.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.880]  Yes.
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:47.880]  This time at Secret Sesh, I did something that I don't usually do.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:48.880]  I was given the VIP gift bag.
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  Yes.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:50.880]  Big shout out to Hunt for giving us both one of those.
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:51.880]  Yeah.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:52.880]  Let's just real quickly go through the gift bag and talk about what's in here.
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:53.880]  There's a bunch of really cool stuff.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:54.880]  A couple of things.
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:55.880]  I'll do it like Christmas.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:56.880]  I'm going to start with the things that are least impressive, but I'm going to do it like
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:57.880]  Christmas.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.880]  I'm going to start with the things that are the least impressive.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:09:59.880]  I'm going to start with the things that are the least impressive.
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:41.360]  to the most impressive to me, a company called Healing Nations, LLC, uh, cultivation, consulting,
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:48.880]  cultivation systems, and nutrients through in a small baggie of cannabis.
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:52.380]  It's a little bit of buds.
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:55.460]  Uh, it's, um, it's okay.
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:58.540]  We, and it's not impressive weed, but it was a gift.
[02:10:58.540 --> 02:10:59.540]  So I appreciate it.
[02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:01.020]  take it to the secret sesh with me.
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.640]  Shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.060]  Shout out to Charlie Torres and his son.
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:07.940]  And also big shout out to Tim
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:10.900]  and everybody involved in Organica down in New Mexico.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:11.940]  I love you guys.
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:16.940]  Those guys grew some arise and it tested at 30.8% THCA.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:21.220]  Yeah, so that's golden goat, cross to the daybreaker.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.460]  I gave them some seeds.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:25.380]  They grew the shit out of my stuff down there.
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:27.260]  So now I've got two strains that have been lab tested
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:30.700]  by steep hill, they've tested over 30% THCA.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:33.460]  Two different labs, same company, right?
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:34.820]  It may be, yeah, two different labs,
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.700]  one in Colorado, one in New Mexico, same company.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:43.340]  The link to that is both strains are golden goat crosses.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.760]  Lemon Jeffrey is the lemon skunk cross
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:47.400]  to a golden goat reversed male.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:48.820]  So it's a feminized seed.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:50.820]  That one hit 31%.
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:55.820]  Then the arise is the fucking golden goat, sorry,
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:11:59.660]  golden, I'm fucking full of shit right now.
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:00.620]  I'm gonna have to edit part of this
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:02.980]  because I'm saying this all wrong.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:04.500]  Lemon skunk is a lemon, yeah,
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.220]  the lemon Jeffrey is a lemon skunk to the golden goat
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:08.660]  and the arise is golden goat to daybreaker.
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:10.860]  So it's basically the non-feminized version
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:12.100]  of the lemon Jeffrey.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:12.940]  And those have both,
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:14.260]  they've got the golden goat parent in there
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:16.140]  and those are both tested over 30% now.
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:17.980]  So shout out to my friends down there in New Mexico,
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:19.240]  shout out to Charlie Torres,
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:23.460]  an organically grown hand trimmed, perfectly cured,
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.220]  perfectly rolled 18 gram joint.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:28.820]  It's gonna get everybody high as shit wherever we go.
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:31.180]  They said they smoked one the other night at another event
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:33.100]  and it went around for over an hour.
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:35.220]  So we're gonna get lit wherever we go
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:36.060]  when we smoke that thing.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:37.060]  Yeah, please call me when you're riding.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:38.560]  It smells delicious.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.580]  It smells amazing.
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:40.460]  I haven't smoked it yet,
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:42.780]  but you can probably see it from here.
[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:43.620]  It's on that table.
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:45.580]  It's that fucking baseball bat sitting over there.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:46.420]  For sure.
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:47.240]  Yeah, that thing, I can't wait to smoke it.
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:48.660]  You showed it to me the other day.
[02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:49.980]  So shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:51.340]  They passed through here the other day.
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:53.180]  Gave me some dazzle, some rosin.
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:54.260]  Shout out to Woody.
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:55.260]  Shout out to the whole crew.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.180]  I appreciate all you guys.
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:57.580]  So I'm gonna continue on with this gift bag.
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:12:59.860]  There's a coupon in here for 15% off any purchase
[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:02.460]  at a specific dispensary that didn't pay me for an ad.
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:03.860]  There is another sticker.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.140]  There's a sticker from Gaia's Garden.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.980]  Let's see, we're moving on up.
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:09.940]  There is some cannabis in here.
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:13.960]  Two small nugs, probably a good gram of weed
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.540]  from Mile High Dispensary.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:18.220]  This is some New York City Diesel.
[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:20.680]  It looks like I approve so far.
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.700]  It's in like a vacuum sealed bag, so I can't smell it,
[02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:24.900]  but it looks quality.
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:26.580]  It's really good.
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:27.980]  I smoked it last night.
[02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:29.180]  Lindsay smoked some of it last night.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:30.020]  What'd you think?
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:30.840]  Did you get high?
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:33.340]  Yeah, actually I had that as the first half of the joint
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:35.020]  and then I had like the second half of the joint
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:36.140]  as something else.
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:37.980]  And it went out after the first half of the joint
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:40.020]  and I just left it that way.
[02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:40.940]  You're just happy with that?
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:41.780]  Nice, all right.
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.660]  Well, I know that New York City Diesel
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.940]  is one of Mike's favorite, or at least the sour diesel.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:48.620]  It's way up on my list, any of the New York diesels.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.500]  All right, well, if you guys wanna smoke that
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:52.420]  or the pre-roll, whichever you feel,
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:53.700]  there might be a pipe here somewhere
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:55.660]  that might be clean in that little pipe cover.
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:56.860]  We'll make this shit happen.
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.180]  All right, and then moving on up the ladder,
[02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:00.020]  it's like Christmas.
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:01.220]  The gifts just keep getting better.
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:03.300]  Our friends at Incredibles Extracts
[02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:08.300]  threw down a half a gram of Sour Band 09, fresh frozen.
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:11.300]  So it's live resin concentrate.
[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:13.340]  It was kind of like a sappy shatter.
[02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:15.260]  Sorry, you guys, I'm burping, excuse me.
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:17.380]  So clear, so gorgeous.
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:19.220]  It tasted so amazing.
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:20.420]  It was so delicious.
[02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:23.260]  It was a half a gram, so it was incredible.
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:24.900]  It's so cheesy, but it's accurate.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:27.660]  It was a half a gram, so I basically did it all in one dab
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:28.980]  because that's how I am.
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:31.580]  But I inhaled and I started to blow it out
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:33.100]  and I was like, oh, that tastes so good.
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:34.900]  And I tried to like catch my exhale
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.980]  so that I could exhale real slowly
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:39.100]  and just savor all of that dab flavor
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.540]  because it was so tasty.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:43.300]  So shout out to Incredibles Extracts.
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:44.380]  Shout out to Derek.
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:45.380]  That shit was delicious.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:46.220]  I approve.
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:48.700]  That's a great thing to throw in a gift bag for a VIP.
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:49.660]  I really like that.
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.940]  Yes, thank you.
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:54.300]  Then my next favorite in here
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:57.540]  was from Guy's Garden Cannabis Creations.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:00.420]  This was a caramel apple double karma edible.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:04.700]  This had 200 milligrams of THC and 20 milligrams of CBD.
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:06.620]  And in this little package, it's one of these,
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:09.540]  like the pop top, oh, I'm trying to pop it.
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:11.460]  There you go, one of these pop top containers.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:14.540]  There were two Tootsie Roll size and shape products
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:16.100]  and they're wrapped in cellophane.
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:17.380]  One of them was green.
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:18.580]  It was the apple.
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:20.620]  The other one was caramel colored
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:22.340]  and it was obviously the caramel.
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.180]  I took a little nibble off the apple.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:25.260]  It was fucking delicious.
[02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:27.780]  It's like sour apple Jolly Ranchers.
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:29.140]  It tastes really good.
[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:31.060]  And then I nibbled off the caramel
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:34.380]  and it was good, but not my favorite kind of caramel ever.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:37.620]  It was a little bit milky maybe might be the description,
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:39.980]  but then I pinched a little of both off
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:41.140]  and threw them both in my mouth.
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:43.300]  And when you mix that apple and that caramel together,
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:44.620]  oh, it was fucking delicious.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.660]  So this edible is really good.
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:49.740]  200 milligrams of THC, 20 milligrams of CBD.
[02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:50.620]  If I was in a shop,
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:54.500]  this probably would have been a $20, 18, $20 edible.
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:55.660]  It was delicious and I approve.
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:57.660]  So shout out to Gaia's Garden.
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:15:58.940]  I really liked that.
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:00.940]  Then my favorite thing in the bag,
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.500]  this is the last thing in the bag and then we'll move on
[02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:03.740]  because I've been going for way longer
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:05.020]  than I wanted to on this.
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:08.820]  I was surprised to see this, Dutch Girl Cannabis Seeds.
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:11.060]  There is a six pack.
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:14.340]  This is all packaged up properly for Colorado retail.
[02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:15.980]  This could be on the shelf.
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:17.420]  I heard that this was available.
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:20.620]  This actual product was available at a local dispensary.
[02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:22.860]  This is a strain called The Animal.
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:25.740]  It's 100% sativa and it is a cross of jabberwocky
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:27.620]  and ghost rain haze.
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.300]  So I got a six pack of seeds.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.980]  We may have to grow those in the future here
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:32.940]  and see what comes of this.
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:33.820]  So shout out to Hunt.
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:35.660]  Shout out to everybody from the Secret Sesh.
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:36.820]  Shout out to Miles.
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:37.660]  Shout out to Adam Hill.
[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:39.620]  Shout out to DJ Juggie.
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:41.700]  Everybody treats me like a VIP.
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:43.980]  We've gone to so many sessions that everybody knows us now.
[02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:45.740]  They see us, they high five us when they walk in.
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:47.540]  They know who we are, I know who they are.
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:48.380]  It's really fun.
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:49.220]  So shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:50.060]  We should move on from that
[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:52.140]  because we've been going for a really long time.
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:53.700]  For sure.
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:56.420]  Shout out to fucking Lindsey and Bobo and Brett
[02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:58.420]  and all the people that just let me come kick it with them.
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:00.060]  When I got there, the party was already started.
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:00.900]  When I walked in, everyone's like,
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:03.500]  scoot over, make room for Rasta Jeff.
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:06.660]  And everybody had like, Bobo had a gift for me.
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:08.380]  Brett had part two of the gift for me.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:09.700]  So they're like, come here, try the gift.
[02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:11.980]  And then there was a podcast listener sitting there
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:13.460]  who I only know you by your Instagram name.
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:14.620]  I cannot think of your real name right now,
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:15.460]  but he was sitting there and he's like,
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:17.020]  oh, what's up?
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:17.860]  And he wanted to shake my hand right away.
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:19.460]  Johnny B from NoGoo wanted to run over
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:20.820]  and shake my hand right away.
[02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:22.260]  Jason Margulies wanted to come over
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:23.340]  and say what's up and get a hug.
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:24.180]  So shout out to him.
[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:25.700]  Oh, Jason, big shout out to Jason.
[02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:26.660]  Yeah, he keeps it moving.
[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:27.900]  That dude's always on the move.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:29.340]  Such a cool brother.
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:32.020]  I have to really quick, Jason did the funniest thing.
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:34.260]  He was telling me how much he loves OGs.
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:38.780]  So I brought him this huge dab of some OG 18 that I had.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:41.260]  And I forgot a carb cap.
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:43.100]  I had heated the nail and everything for him
[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:44.380]  and I forgot a carb cap.
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.740]  So as he's taking the dab, I'm like, Jason, I'm horrid.
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:49.220]  I forgot a carb cap.
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:52.180]  There was the countertop that was like granite
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:55.820]  and he goes underneath it and caps it,
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:58.300]  like moves himself up and down
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:02.460]  and caps it with the corner of the countertop.
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:04.460]  Yeah, and then just exhaled and hands back the rig
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:05.940]  and he goes, thanks, that was great.
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:07.620]  I was like, Jason, you're my hero.
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:09.580]  I'm glad to see that the MacGyver spirit
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:10.740]  of the community is alive and well.
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.020]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:14.380]  Big shout out to Jason for just being awesome.
[02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:16.340]  It's awesome walking into an event
[02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:17.980]  and being treated like a fucking rock star.
[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:18.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:20.180]  Yeah, I wish somebody would have told the people
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:22.340]  at the door who I was, but whatever.
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:26.140]  I wasn't on any list or anything.
[02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:28.220]  Hunt told me, just come through, I got you.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:30.380]  And so when I got there, like, you're not on any list.
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:31.900]  And I was like, I know, go, go.
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:32.740]  I know Hunt though.
[02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:33.580]  And like, we don't care.
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:34.980]  And I was like, no, but for real,
[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:36.500]  if I tell Hunt, you turn me away,
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:37.380]  he's going to be fucking pissed.
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:38.980]  You better go let him know I'm here.
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:39.900]  And the guy came back, he's like,
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.860]  you're all square to go, bro, I'm sorry.
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:44.180]  I was like, yeah, dude, I'm not trying to be a dick.
[02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:46.260]  Like Hunt told me personally, show up.
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:48.340]  Do you want to see my text messages?
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.900]  I'll even delete his name so it shows up his number
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:52.420]  and you can compare it to yours.
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:53.940]  Yeah, that's pretty close to being like,
[02:18:53.940 --> 02:18:55.460]  you just want to read my messages, dude.
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:57.180]  But no, so they let me in, but yeah, I got in,
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:58.380]  got to have a good ass time.
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:18:59.820]  I don't think I left that one seat
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:01.780]  other than to take a piss once or twice.
[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:03.580]  Shout out for the nachos, thank you, I needed that.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:05.020]  Oh yeah, bro, I did too.
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:06.340]  I'm sitting there taking dabs and I look up
[02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:08.100]  and Lindsey's like, I got nachos,
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:10.020]  I got them vegetarian so you could eat some.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.060]  And I was like, damn, I'm gonna eat
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:12.420]  all those jalapenos on there.
[02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:14.140]  Yeah, I don't like jalapenos, so you-
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:14.980]  Perfect.
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:15.820]  That was, yeah.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:20.580]  So I mentioned the gift that Bobo made for me.
[02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:22.820]  There is a new thing, let's talk about this new thing
[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:24.140]  and then we'll actually get to the main topic
[02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:26.460]  of this podcast, the new trend.
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:28.500]  So I've been talking about Terps here in Colorado
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:29.700]  a whole bunch.
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:32.700]  In my hand, I've got a half dram vial.
[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:35.500]  That's a small vial, those small vials with a screw on lid.
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:36.700]  I've got the shorty one.
[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:40.660]  It's some ghost rain haze, liquid Terps.
[02:19:40.660 --> 02:19:44.380]  My friend Tim from New Mexico, my friends Tim and Charlie
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:46.780]  showed up from New Mexico with this device
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:48.460]  that looked like a large pipette.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.980]  It's real skinny on one end and it tapers
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:53.100]  and gets thicker at the other end.
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:55.460]  It's got like a mouthpiece made onto it
[02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:57.940]  and they were dunking it into the Terps
[02:19:57.940 --> 02:19:59.940]  and then letting the excess drip off
[02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:01.460]  back into the container.
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:04.500]  And then without any fire, you keep it tipped down
[02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:07.540]  like you would a straw and you just draw through,
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:10.260]  they call it a Terp straw, just draw right through it
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:12.940]  with no heat while it's cool, you pull air through it
[02:20:12.940 --> 02:20:17.700]  and you can taste the Terps incredibly strong.
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:20.540]  And we were able to put what I would normally dunk
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:24.300]  onto a dab, four people took two good draws off of it
[02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:26.300]  before the flavor went away.
[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:28.100]  And I don't know that I got any head change
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:31.420]  because I was already high and we're smoking rosin and stuff
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:34.340]  but it's an incredible way to experience the flavor
[02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:38.140]  and the essence of the Terps without any fire
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:40.140]  or without any waste, I really thought it was cool.
[02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:43.740]  So I was talking about this to Bobo
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:45.180]  who is now learning how to blow glass
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:46.940]  who's coming along super fucking quickly.
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:47.980]  You guys, if you could see what he's doing,
[02:20:47.980 --> 02:20:49.540]  I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna spill his beans.
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:52.340]  He's got an idea, he's got a project that I think is-
[02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:53.180]  Really cool.
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.220]  It's the new shit, it is the new thing.
[02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:56.300]  I think this guy is gonna kill it
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.980]  but he made me a Terp straw.
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:01.460]  So shout out to Bobo for the new sip and Terp straw.
[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:03.080]  It's got some red, gold and green line work.
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:05.200]  It's got a little Colorado Millie.
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:06.280]  Is that a Millie, is that what that is?
[02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:07.760]  It's an implosion, it's a Millie, I don't know.
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:10.440]  Yeah, he did a little like flower implosion
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:13.240]  but he did it with the Colorado emblem.
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:15.360]  Yeah, it's really sweet, I really appreciate it.
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:16.880]  He's making a modification to it
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:17.720]  because it's a new product,
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:19.960]  he's gonna modify it and perfect it for me.
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:22.080]  But he's making a little modification that I requested
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.800]  but shout out for that, I totally appreciate that.
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:26.800]  But you're gonna see more people taking cold sip Terps
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:28.680]  at events and things in the future here.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:31.240]  I think it's gonna be something that will catch on.
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:36.000]  Also, I owe a shout out to a glass artist
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.920]  who's Cameron Reed, that's hard to remember.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.880]  I knew the name, I just had to say it slowly
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:42.660]  which is funny because we'll talk about this
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:43.960]  but shout out to Cameron Reed Glass.
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:45.200]  I'll save that for another episode
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.440]  because that's gonna get long.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:51.440]  Let's work on some of the main topics of this podcast.
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.920]  Let's quickly go through the band names.
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:58.120]  In Oregon, they have Medical Marijuana available
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:01.220]  and they have recently banned some of the names.
[02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:05.340]  They legalized marijuana for all adults
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:09.980]  a year and a half ago.
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:11.780]  And they're just now getting through
[02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:14.140]  to implementing regulations.
[02:22:14.140 --> 02:22:17.580]  They've had stores and zoning for a minute.
[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:21.620]  And one of the new regulations is some common strain names
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:23.740]  are going away in the state of Oregon.
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:25.460]  I've got a short article, I'm not gonna read all of it
[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:26.900]  because the second half of the article
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:29.780]  is not even related to anything involved in what this is.
[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:31.100]  They just ramble on about some stuff.
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:34.180]  This comes from the Oregonian and the headline says,
[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:36.680]  no more Girl Scout cookies and other popular names
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:40.980]  on pot packaging state says, and this is by Noel Crombie.
[02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:42.420]  And the article goes like this,
[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.180]  popular names such as Girl Scout cookies
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:46.220]  and Charlotte's Web won't be allowed on the labeling
[02:22:46.220 --> 02:22:48.620]  and packaging of medical and recreational marijuana
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:52.300]  in Oregon under rules approved by the state Friday.
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:54.820]  The Oregon Liquor Control Commission said
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:57.260]  it had reviewed about 500 marijuana strain names
[02:22:57.260 --> 02:23:00.760]  and identified about 20 that may appeal to children.
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:02.520]  Commissioners sought the rule change
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.420]  after hearing from members of the public
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:06.960]  who objected to the child friendly names.
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.200]  I'm gonna interject here.
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:11.160]  The fuck is the kid doing in the dispensary anyway?
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:13.560]  How's the kid gonna see that on there?
[02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:16.520]  I think they're talking about on the packaging at home
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:17.520]  when it's around.
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:19.120]  Okay, I'll give up that.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:21.120]  One of the arguments.
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:21.960]  That's fucked up.
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:22.800]  That's what I'm here for.
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:25.040]  That's fucked up that Lindsay is the voice of reason today.
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:26.080]  Yeah, because I...
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:28.480]  Nevermind.
[02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:30.840]  Children's one of the arguments the anti-pop people
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:32.840]  have really been able to get legislatures
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:34.720]  around the country to listen to.
[02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:37.960]  And so when we get to the Colorado rules in a minute,
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.040]  the reasons they were implemented are essentially identical.
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:43.600]  And I agree, we need to keep cannabis products
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:44.560]  out of the hands of children.
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.640]  That's not something that's cool.
[02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:46.480]  I don't want your kids.
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:50.520]  Unless it is a medical condition that they need it for.
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:51.360]  Right, right.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:53.600]  Well, I just don't want my kid taking my cannabis.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:54.880]  I was gonna say somebody else's,
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:55.720]  but I'll put this in on me.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:56.560]  Kids should not be using it recreationally.
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:59.320]  I don't want my child getting access to my Schumet bar
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:01.640]  and taking this to school and giving it to your kid
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:03.720]  and your kid fucking freaking out at school
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:06.880]  and you suing me and the school getting mad at me.
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:07.720]  My kid, that shit doesn't need to happen.
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:09.160]  The reality is that you put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:10.000]  That's been incredibly rare in Colorado.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.320]  Did you just call me Ricky Bobby?
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:13.440]  Yeah, I said, don't put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby,
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:14.800]  because you said I'd have a kid.
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:16.800]  I'm gonna go fast.
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:18.040]  All right, I'm gonna get back into this article
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:19.760]  before we totally train wreck this bitch.
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:22.560]  So there's some strain names being banned in Oregon now.
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:24.000]  Yes.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.920]  Don't worry, the strains themselves haven't been banned.
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.800]  Right, right, well, yeah, yeah, completely.
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:31.040]  There've been some breeders have been talking
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.080]  on Facebook forums and such about this.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:34.760]  The article goes, the rule approved one day
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:37.520]  before the state licenses recreational marijuana retailers
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.800]  prohibits words that refer to products
[02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:41.600]  that are commonly associated with minors
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:43.840]  or marketed by minors.
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:46.080]  Chairman of the commission called the new requirement
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:47.280]  a common sense approach.
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:48.760]  If you walk through a toy store
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:51.720]  and you can identify things that are strain names,
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:53.960]  those are probably inappropriate, he said.
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.160]  It's also as simple as that.
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:57.920]  The agency also won't allow strain names
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:01.800]  that refer to illicit drugs, such as LSD and blow.
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.520]  LSD is just lemon sour diesel.
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:05.120]  It's just way easier to fucking write.
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:07.520]  And blow is a stupid fucking name for a strain name.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:09.120]  So cool, I'm good with that.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:10.000]  No more green crack either.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.840]  Yeah, we'll get to that list.
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.160]  A list of outlawed proper names.
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:17.160]  Girl Scout Cookies, Grape Ape, Candyland,
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.120]  Charlotte's Web, Cinderella, Doctor Who,
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.120]  Bubblicious, Smurf, Bruce Banner, Death Star,
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:24.560]  Skywalker, and Jedi Kush.
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:25.760]  Those strains will still be allowed
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:27.280]  in Oregon's recreational shops.
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.720]  Retailers and marijuana producers and processors
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:33.000]  can use initials or some other shorthand reference
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.800]  instead of the full strain name.
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:35.640]  Okay.
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:36.480]  Yeah, so let's see.
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:39.320]  So it doesn't have to get renamed or anything.
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:41.040]  All right, this isn't as bad as I thought.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:42.200]  Right, well, yeah.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.360]  But it's pretty gentle, but it's also pretty silly.
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:47.480]  It is kind of silly that you can't have Skywalker
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:48.760]  or Jedi Kush.
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:49.600]  Okay.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:51.320]  I mean, I don't know how they're doing it in Oregon,
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:54.760]  but in Colorado, it's block printed in black lettering.
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:56.640]  That's how the strain name gets printed
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:59.240]  on pretty much every product that leaves a legal dispensary.
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:01.640]  I mean, it's never down the front.
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:03.760]  Like the Toys R Us logo is different colors.
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:05.920]  What's the really cute font for kids' eyes?
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:10.520]  It's just computer printed on a packaging label
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.640]  with a shitload of other information on it.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:15.760]  Okay, let me be the voice of reason again.
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:21.120]  We are still able to legally buy weed
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:24.800]  in a shop, so is it that they give a deal?
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:26.520]  I forget how long or how short of a time you've been here.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:28.600]  You gotta get used to it so you can start bitching
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:30.760]  about all the little impractical things.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:32.360]  No, listen, I completely understand
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.560]  where you guys are coming from.
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:35.000]  No, because you're 100% right.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  I just feel like in the marijuana industry and community,
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:44.560]  we have such bigger battles to be fighting
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:47.720]  than the fact that we can't use the name Girl Scout Cookies.
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:48.600]  I'm not being mean.
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.280]  I'm just saying to me it just feels like
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:53.280]  we can all buy legal weed.
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:55.720]  I get it, it's a bummer and it's a big deal,
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:58.880]  but at the end of the day,
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:01.120]  it's not like you have to rename the strain
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:05.480]  to be something completely ridiculous
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:07.760]  that's nothing to do with cookies.
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.160]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:12.320]  They're not saying you can't use any cookie name or any.
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:14.720]  They took 20 names out of 500,
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.120]  which in the grand scheme of things is probably so minute.
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.080]  Do you think Bounty Killer would make this list?
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:22.920]  Probably.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.240]  Is the Bounty Killer not allowed?
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.720]  I feel like a lot of Colorado strains
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:31.760]  would be pulled on that list.
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:34.000]  I was thinking about the different ones
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.080]  I've had on a shelf in front of me
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:39.080]  while I've been working in the legal industry.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.680]  And I think about maybe 20% of them.
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:44.080]  And oddly enough, Green Crack is not on this list.
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:46.280]  Ooh, that's interesting.
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:47.560]  When I read the list, I was like,
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:48.880]  well, there's a bunch missing.
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:50.720]  Like if this is the criteria.
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:54.040]  So maybe they just got the super blatant ones
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:55.480]  and they left the others.
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:57.160]  Girls Love Cookies makes sense.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:58.000]  For sure.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.280]  When you said that, I was like,
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:01.080]  oh, that makes absolute sense.
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:02.040]  That is children.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:03.720]  That's a children organization.
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:05.680]  Grape Ape Candyland, Charlotte's Web.
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:06.720]  That's all children's stuff.
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:08.240]  Charlotte's Web is a kid's book.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:09.760]  That one actually made me laugh.
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:10.800]  A kid's character.
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.680]  There's a company that spent a fortune
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:16.320]  in half a decade marketing Charlotte's Web
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.160]  around the country.
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:18.000]  Right, yep.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.080]  And fucking Cinderella.
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:19.920]  I mean-
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:20.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:22.480]  So Girl Scout Cookies, we're just gonna call that GSC.
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:24.280]  And it also says derivative strains.
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:27.480]  You can't use platinum Girl Scouts or Thin Mints either.
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:29.840]  So, oh, so then you probably can't use Do-Si-Do's?
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:30.840]  Do-Si-Do's are banned?
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:32.080]  Well, yeah, every-
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.520]  But yeah.
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:35.640]  I saw something the other day that was Snickerdoodle
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.080]  was the strain name.
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:40.400]  The fruit names.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.640]  I mean, how many different ones vaguely meet
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:45.520]  an item a kid might have for dessert also?
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.600]  Right.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:48.280]  Sour Lemon Sherbet.
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:49.480]  Doctor Who is taken,
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:50.800]  because it's a fictional character
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:52.120]  currently marketed to children, including cartoons.
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.040]  Basically any fictional character.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:56.520]  When I first read this, I was like,
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:59.400]  well, some jackass made an Obama Kush.
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:02.160]  Is that gone too, because kids know the president?
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:05.600]  I mean, how far are they going with this particular?
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.200]  And that's why I have an issue with it,
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:09.600]  because as a regulation, it's a little bizarre.
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:10.800]  Right.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:14.160]  You can ban cartoons from the name or from the logo.
[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:16.160]  You can do a lot of other things
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.320]  to make sure that the products don't target children,
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:21.080]  but banning stuff that's going to be,
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:22.440]  like just words in black print,
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:23.880]  like some of it makes a little bit of sense,
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:26.960]  but some of it's just going to be a regulatory pain
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:28.320]  in the ass down the road, for sure.
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:29.600]  Just more hoops to jump through.
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:31.200]  Just more bitching and complaining
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:32.680]  for them to do about cannabis.
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:34.480]  A lot of it's subjective.
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:35.320]  Yes.
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:39.120]  And that's what makes it a regulatory issue in my mind.
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.560]  We'll get to some Colorado rules here in just a second
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.640]  that it's not subjective.
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:44.880]  Well, let's jump right to that then.
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:48.120]  That's a good segue, Mike, since we're like 27 minutes in.
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:49.120]  Let's get to this.
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:50.120]  About halfway through the show,
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:51.320]  it's a perfect time to move on
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:53.600]  to my favorite topic of the show.
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:57.960]  Colorado recently, until a few days ago, until the 1st,
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:00.000]  I was allowed to walk into a dispensary,
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.960]  a medical dispensary or recreational dispensary,
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:05.840]  and I was able to buy without any special paperwork.
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:07.760]  I think to the best of my knowledge,
[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.120]  I was allowed to buy two ounces of concentrates.
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:11.760]  It means I could buy two ounces of Shatter,
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:13.000]  is that correct? Yes.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:13.840]  Lindsay says yes.
[02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:14.680]  Mike, is that correct?
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:15.520]  Medically, yes.
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:16.840]  In a medical shop, yes.
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:18.400]  In a rec shop, just the one.
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:19.960]  Okay, so in a medical shop,
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:20.960]  I could get my two ounces
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:21.880]  because I'm a medical patient.
[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:23.160]  In a recreational shop,
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:25.880]  I was allowed to buy one ounce of concentrate,
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:27.520]  which is enough concentrate.
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:29.200]  That's not a lot of concentrate.
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:30.040]  I mean, if you're me,
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:32.800]  I mean, there was a fucking two pounds
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:35.800]  of fucking rosin on this table just a couple of days ago.
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:40.800]  But an ounce or two is a substantial amount.
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:43.440]  Now the new rule is no matter who you are,
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:44.680]  no matter where you're shopping,
[02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:46.000]  eight gram limit.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.600]  The original rule was just basic math.
[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:48.440]  I don't think so.
[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:49.560]  On the medical side too.
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:51.400]  I'm pretty sure that's on the medical side too.
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:53.240]  I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:54.840]  I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:57.120]  Ah, then the article that I read has misled me
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.480]  and I'm glad you guys have corrected me.
[02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:01.680]  Recreational for 100% sure,
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:04.360]  you can only buy eight grams of concentrate now
[02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:07.200]  and there are other rules for edibles
[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:11.040]  and other items that are sold by the milligram
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.080]  like edibles and vape pen cartridges.
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:16.200]  So if I'm not mistaken,
[02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:17.080]  I'm doing this from memory.
[02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.200]  Everybody else is their phone app cheater.
[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:22.200]  No, back check for the audience.
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:23.520]  Back checking like a mother right now.
[02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.240]  You keep talking, go slow.
[02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:28.680]  Edible and vape pen limit is now 800 milligrams.
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:30.360]  It used to be 2,800.
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:34.960]  And concentrate limits are now,
[02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:36.440]  was it seven or eight?
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:40.480]  Eight grams of concentrate.
[02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:44.040]  Is that edible limit changed on the medical side as well?
[02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:46.040]  I don't, as far as I know,
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:48.000]  these are just recreational rules.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.080]  I think the only thing that changed
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:52.800]  on the medical side was compliance.
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:55.400]  Some edible compliance labeling rules, right?
[02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:58.560]  Yeah, and imprinting on bars and stuff.
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:03.400]  So there were two different rule changes in Colorado,
[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:05.280]  or three different rule changes in Colorado.
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:07.920]  One limits what people can buy.
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:11.440]  One limits the shape of certain gummies.
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:13.840]  Yeah, of edibles in general.
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:15.600]  Or edibles period.
[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:19.120]  And, but mostly affecting gummies right now market-wide.
[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:23.080]  And then the last rule is edibles in Colorado,
[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:26.440]  now the actual item has to carry a stamp.
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:28.480]  And I actually took notes today.
[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:34.400]  The Denver Post had an interview with Larry Wolk,
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:38.000]  the head of the Department of Colorado Health
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.160]  and Environment, the CDPHE,
[02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:42.680]  and somebody from the top of the MED,
[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:44.480]  the Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:51.040]  The edible symbols, there's two exceptions.
[02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:53.600]  So like every piece of chocolate has to carry a little,
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:56.520]  if it's recreational, a yellow diamond
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:59.040]  with the letters THC exclamation point in it.
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:01.520]  And the medical just has the M, right, for medical?
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:05.360]  No, it's the same diamond.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:07.280]  It doesn't have to be a color though.
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:10.040]  And it has to say THC.
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:12.240]  Oh, they might've dropped the color.
[02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:13.680]  That was one of the original things.
[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:14.520]  And people were like, well,
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:16.760]  how do we make it yellow on a brownie?
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:18.080]  Without frosting or some such.
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:20.480]  It took a while for some companies to get this implemented.
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:23.040]  I've seen one company that they just made a disc
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.120]  out of sugar.
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:26.160]  So it's 100% edible,
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:27.640]  but it has the logo on it.
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:29.520]  And then they've affixed it to the top of their product
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.960]  with like melted marshmallow.
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:34.320]  It is weird in practice, but it's pretty tasty.
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:40.020]  But the only exceptions to carrying that symbol are liquids.
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:44.840]  The liquids manufacturers managed to get the legislature
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:48.360]  to see reason and make a specific exception for liquids
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:52.000]  so that you can't stamp a liquid.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:55.360]  And they were literally for a while talking
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:58.160]  about making it having gold style Schlager floaties
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:02.240]  that said THC in it or some such,
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:06.400]  or only doing single serving packages of liquids.
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.680]  So it could only come in a 10 milligram serving
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:11.640]  recreationally, which would pretty much kill
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:13.240]  recreational liquids.
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:15.880]  But they carved out an exception.
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:18.840]  It can still be a hundred milligram liquid container
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:23.000]  as long as the measuring device is part of that container.
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.560]  And stuff like granola now has to come
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:27.200]  in single serving packages.
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:30.600]  Anything like any edible that can't carry the stamp
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:34.720]  has to come in individual serving size packages
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:36.800]  with the label affixed to that packaging
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:40.120]  so that you can't leave it on a table
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.160]  and somebody come along and pick it up.
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:45.200]  Which is a felony in its own right.
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.240]  Before we came up with the label,
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:50.720]  it's still a felony with the label.
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:52.520]  It's like leaving a loaded gun on a table.
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:56.720]  It's wildly inappropriate adult behavior.
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:01.480]  Yeah, that's the basic edible rundown.
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:02.800]  Did you find-
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:05.520]  Yes, the article, I had to go through three articles
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:06.960]  to actually find the truth.
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:09.040]  Medical marijuana will remain unchanged.
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:10.880]  Only one article said that.
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:12.520]  The first article that I was reading
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:14.520]  was actually sponsored by a dispensary.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.280]  So they were trying to leave medical marijuana
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:17.800]  out on purpose, I think, because of the way
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:19.320]  that it was worded, it totally made it look
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:20.800]  like it was happening all over the board.
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:25.800]  So I'm glad that the medical market remains unchanged.
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:29.360]  The industry's been talking about this for a year now.
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:30.840]  Lindsay's been over there committing felonies
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:32.280]  for the past four days and not knowing it.
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:34.240]  Not even, it's only the second.
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:36.520]  But I was definitely just me this weekend.
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:39.440]  So I was the only one committing felonies, friend.
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:41.200]  A lot of people are sweating this
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:42.840]  because so far in Colorado,
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:45.280]  not a single licensed dispensary
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:49.200]  has screwed up the purchase limit rule.
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:54.240]  No one's been cited or fined for selling over the limit yet.
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:56.680]  Yeah, it's only been a couple of days.
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:59.360]  Well, no, we've always had purchase limits.
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:00.200]  Over the limit of anything, okay.
[02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:01.760]  And so, yeah, period, in Colorado,
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:04.240]  no shop has been cited for that.
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:06.160]  And that's sort of, it's one of those little
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.320]  random points of pride.
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.680]  For a while, our teen ID checks things.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:15.680]  We were at 99%, which is unheard of in liquor or tobacco.
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:16.800]  And we were real proud of that.
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:18.080]  And then we had one bad round
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:19.440]  and got knocked down to 92,
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:23.000]  just like alcohol and tobacco, and that hurt.
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.800]  But they don't even check alcohol and tobacco.
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:29.520]  They do, but it's not nearly what they do with marijuana.
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.040]  They were doing, it was a real ID,
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:35.800]  and the person in the ID was wearing a hat.
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:38.960]  And the person checking the ID was supposed to catch that.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:41.760]  That was the last ID sting that I heard about
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:43.840]  performed on a marijuana store.
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.680]  That's sketchy.
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:45.520]  That's shady.
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:46.720]  That's just trying to fuck with us.
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:50.000]  I know that's checking compliance to the nth degree.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.040]  Marijuana shops also face 10 times the fine
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.200]  that a tobacco or alcohol retailer would.
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:56.360]  Of course.
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:59.080]  It's 10 grand if you sell cigarettes or alcohol
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:01.120]  to somebody underage is the possible fine
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:02.960]  with marijuana, it's 100.
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:04.200]  That could ruin a business.
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:05.280]  That could just close you down.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:06.680]  No matter how big your dispensary is,
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:07.840]  $100,000 fine could kill you.
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:09.680]  So I guess that's why you gotta be careful.
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:10.520]  All right, so now-
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:11.920]  Well, that's why, one of the reasons it never happens.
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:15.400]  Recreational shoppers can now only buy eight grams.
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:17.280]  Does that mean that people that come to do,
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:18.640]  that means the ounce deals are gonna go away
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:20.760]  at the rec shops, no more cheap ounce deals
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:22.320]  because you can't buy an ounce.
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:24.840]  Of hash, you can still buy 28 grams of flour.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.360]  Yeah, I'm just talking about, yeah, cheap,
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:27.960]  because I mean, you'd see concentrate deals
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:30.080]  for like 420, 500 for a cheap ounce.
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:32.120]  Well, and there's no and either.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:35.000]  And so you can't get your limit in flour
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.680]  and your limit in hash and your limit in edibles.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:39.960]  There's actually a chart that's been going around
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:41.200]  that shows how the breakdown is,
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:43.640]  how many grams of hash equals how many grams of flour,
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.960]  how many grams of milligrams of edibles
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:47.200]  equal how many grams of flour.
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:48.160]  I don't pay attention to the chart
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:50.680]  because I'm not working at a bud tender station.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:53.120]  There was this great like three month period
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:55.720]  where bud tenders didn't have to do pointless math
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:57.520]  in their head all day long,
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:59.920]  like counting to seven over and over
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.360]  in different fractions,
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.760]  depending on what the order was or whatever.
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:06.960]  We was just 28 was the limit and it was real simple.
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:08.560]  And now there's this that they,
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:11.160]  or we all have to keep in our head that sucks.
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:13.640]  Just more regulation to follow.
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:17.240]  Do you think it's just gonna make people go to more stores?
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:19.600]  People that are smurfing, yeah.
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:23.480]  But this rule really isn't for them.
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:24.600]  There hasn't been a lot of that.
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:25.800]  That's why they just recently
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:28.040]  upped the out of state purchase limit to an ounce.
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:28.880]  Okay.
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.680]  When this rule was originally passed,
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:32.880]  they were talking about out of state
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:35.480]  just can only buy one and a half grams of hash.
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.960]  I laughed the first time I read it
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.320]  because I looked down at my case and I was like,
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:41.400]  everything comes in one gram containers.
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:42.240]  Yeah.
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:43.080]  How are you gonna buy a half gram?
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:45.320]  You can buy one gram or we've got to talk
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:47.560]  to all our distributors and see if they can do a half Z.
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:48.400]  Yup.
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:51.080]  But they hammered it out.
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:52.640]  And then just recently, a couple months ago,
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:53.480]  they upped that limit.
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:55.280]  So I don't think they're worried about smurfing.
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:57.600]  They just, somebody in the legislature was like,
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:01.360]  wait, we let people buy 28 grams of hash
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:03.440]  or 280, what was it?
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:05.560]  2,800 grams of edibles.
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:09.240]  And it's 28 of the, or 280 of the most potent edibles
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:10.440]  sold in a rec shop.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:11.280]  Wow.
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:12.440]  Because it's a shit ton of edibles.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:13.360]  Yeah.
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.640]  I've seen people leave the spot with fucking bags.
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:19.520]  I used to have, every now and again,
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:21.560]  I'd say, I'll go get you a box, hold on.
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:23.080]  I mean, it happens throughout the industry.
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:24.560]  And security would follow them to the car
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:26.000]  and make sure they got to their car safely
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.560]  because they had that much product on them.
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:30.560]  But it happens from time to time.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:32.520]  It's just one of those things.
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.160]  And now with these new limits,
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:36.240]  anybody that's looking to do that
[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:38.000]  is just going to have to make more stops.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.880]  But it's a weird set of rules.
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:41.640]  You can tell it's not the same group of people
[02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:42.600]  writing all of these.
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:44.080]  Can I ask you a completely random question
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:44.920]  that's off topic?
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:45.760]  Sure.
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:46.600]  You guys have both been bud tenders.
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:48.320]  You have plenty of experience behind the bud counter
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:49.480]  and ringing people up.
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:51.680]  What is the largest ticket you have ever
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:53.680]  rung up a single person for?
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:55.080]  My largest personal ticket?
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:56.120]  Yeah.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:57.400]  It's like 1,700.
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:58.720]  Damn, at a rec shop?
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:39:59.560]  Yep.
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:00.400]  Okay.
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:02.000]  Lins, do you remember?
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:03.240]  Oh, I know what it is.
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:04.480]  Do you want to say it?
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:05.840]  Is it beat Mike 1,700?
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:06.680]  And I'm pretty sure it does.
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:07.520]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:08.560]  Because I mean, it's a medical shop.
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:10.080]  You can buy so much more.
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:12.080]  Yeah, the limits are totally different.
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.360]  Do I know the purchaser?
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:17.360]  I can't do that.
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:18.200]  You cannot?
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:19.120]  She's got different rules than I do.
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:19.960]  That's true.
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:22.440]  I just work at basically a store in the mall
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:25.160]  are the rules I follow other than the ID checks.
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:26.320]  She works in a medical shop.
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:29.280]  There's also an extra paperwork a doctor has to see.
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:30.520]  She's going to write down a number.
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:33.120]  She's going to write it down and we're going to gasp.
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:35.720]  She just kept typing zeros.
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:36.560]  What the fuck?
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.400]  Okay.
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.360]  She's got me beat by an order of magnitude, folks.
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:40.520]  It's five digits, you guys.
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.720]  Congrats, you kicked the shit out of my order.
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:43.560]  It's five digits.
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:44.760]  Yeah, that's, that's, that's.
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:47.080]  I hope that came with like a hell of a prize.
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:48.760]  I was just going to ask if anybody tipped you
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:50.240]  or took care of you for that.
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:53.120]  She's shaking her head no and putting the lid back
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:53.960]  on her bottle.
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:55.640]  The giant tickets don't often tip.
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:56.480]  Right?
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:57.440]  Yeah, no.
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:40:59.440]  Those frugal people is how they have all that extra money
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:00.720]  because they don't fucking tip.
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:02.120]  Yeah.
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.160]  Tip your butt tender.
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:05.000]  Yeah.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:05.840]  Shout out to Molly.
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:06.680]  Where was Molly?
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:07.520]  Molly was not at the secret sesh.
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:08.360]  That's weird.
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:09.200]  We didn't see Molly.
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.040]  I just realized that Molly didn't show up.
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:13.520]  Molly was at a concert or something like that.
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.360]  I hope Molly had fun.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:15.360]  She was hiking somewhere
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:16.920]  because I saw some Instagram pictures.
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:19.400]  She was up on top of some crazy big rock.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  Shout out to you, girl.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:21.240]  Happy birthday, Molly.
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:22.080]  Big birthday hikes are awesome.
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:23.000]  We're late, but happy birthday.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:23.840]  We still love you.
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:24.680]  Yeah.
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.520]  Hope you had a great time.
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:27.240]  Mike, did you get to cover all of your edible stuff
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:28.720]  that you wanted to talk about?
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:31.200]  I think I hit all the new rule changes.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:32.880]  We covered the purchase limit.
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:33.840]  We covered that-
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:36.680]  It's under the impression that everybody-
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:38.840]  Oh, and shapes are changing.
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:41.920]  You can no longer do human shapes,
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:44.520]  animal shapes, fruit shapes.
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:48.560]  Anything that resembles a candy that's on the shelf.
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:50.400]  Yeah, or anything that's identical
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.820]  to its non-medicated market counterpart.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.040]  So all of your gummies are now squares.
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:41:59.400]  Which works out well
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.200]  because it's really easy to imprint the new symbol
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:02.040]  into a square.
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:04.960]  What else?
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:07.280]  How are they handling the sodas?
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:09.400]  You can still do 100 milligram beverages
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:10.880]  in the rec market.
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:14.200]  The container has to carry the new label
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.360]  and the dosing instruments.
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:21.760]  So it has to come with a NyQuil medicine top
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:25.560]  so that you can dose out your 10 milligram dose
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:27.400]  and do weed shots with your friends.
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:28.240]  That's pretty funny.
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:29.120]  I used to drink that in the back line
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:30.720]  when I was selling those all day.
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:33.360]  Have you ever drank the Canna Punch or the Keef Cola?
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:34.200]  Oh yeah.
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:36.760]  Do you feel like you get high more quickly?
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:38.680]  The liquid's definitely kicking quicker.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:40.240]  Yeah, it's because it's sublingual.
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:41.800]  You get a nice sublingual.
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:44.240]  And your stomach doesn't have to break down the brownie.
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:45.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.880]  It's just absorbable quicker.
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:48.720]  It's like you drink it
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:50.040]  and then you go to do whatever you're doing
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:51.200]  and then you turn your head to one way
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:52.360]  to look at something and you go,
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.280]  ho, I'm high.
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:57.240]  With Canna Punch, check the label.
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:00.440]  There's a range of THC in the Canna Punches.
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:04.480]  I drink a 200 and I drink it in about one full chug.
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:05.600]  Check the back of the label.
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:07.640]  It might be like 230.
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:08.880]  All right, 30 milligrams
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:10.000]  ain't gonna make a difference to me.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.120]  Well, in the rec market,
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:13.840]  there's like a 10, 15, 20 milligram swing
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:15.240]  that you can see on the back of this.
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:16.800]  Yes, it might be higher than medical.
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:18.120]  In fact, as soon as we get done here,
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:20.080]  I'm gonna go eat another 100 milligrams from Sky's Garden.
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:21.920]  There's some medical hash on the table
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:23.400]  and I was really pumped to see
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:26.360]  that it had lab testing for potency on the back.
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:27.800]  The medical's coming along with that
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:28.920]  and I love to see it.
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:29.760]  For sure.
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:31.440]  Totally random interjection there.
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:32.960]  Pretty soon, everything will be lab tested.
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:33.800]  Go ahead.
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:35.600]  We had a customer appreciation day at the shop
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:40.320]  and I chugged a Keef Cola 100 milligram orange soda before it
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:42.120]  not thinking like anything of it.
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:46.120]  And I'm like 45 minutes into being there
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:48.600]  and I'm like, what the fuck is the matter with me?
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:51.680]  And I'm like, and then I remembered a conversation
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:54.000]  I had had with Buzzy a couple of days before that
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.440]  about how like drinks are sublingual
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:57.600]  and they like hit you harder.
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:00.120]  And I was like, wow, you're an idiot, Lindsey.
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:02.120]  You just chugged that thing right before you came in
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:04.840]  not even like, it didn't taste that hashy.
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:07.200]  So I was just like, go, go, go.
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:09.760]  We got a bunch of 10 milligram samples at one point
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:13.200]  and I took the four flavor samples we got home
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:15.200]  and without thinking about it, drank all four of them
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:18.560]  and like jotted down a little flavor review about each one
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:20.200]  and just ruined myself.
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.280]  I like being edible ruined to an extent.
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:25.120]  Yeah.
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:26.160]  Can you pass me the torch?
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:28.320]  I think about 250 milligrams right now
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:29.520]  is just about perfect for me.
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:31.400]  I don't wanna go too much far past there
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:32.880]  cause that's when I started getting a little goofy
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:34.440]  and started getting a little hazy.
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:35.280]  Hazy?
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:36.360]  But I'm back on the edible whore.
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:38.800]  So when I see you, I will not, probably not be able to-
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:40.440]  Did you say edible whore or edible horse?
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:42.360]  Yeah, I thought he did too.
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:43.200]  It's funny the way I heard it.
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.440]  I think you said whore.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:45.600]  Well, that too.
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:48.360]  Whichever.
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:49.640]  I'm gonna be an edible whore.
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:51.480]  I'll take any edibles you have.
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:52.840]  He didn't say he was gonna be
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:55.320]  or he was back to being an edible whore.
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:57.280]  He said I'm back on the edible whore
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:58.720]  which is way fucking funny.
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:44:59.960]  Well, then I'm doing that.
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:00.800]  Yeah.
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:02.920]  You got an hashtag on the edible whore.
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:04.640]  Hashtag who are you?
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:08.280]  Hashtag can I get on it too?
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:09.880]  Hashtag troll the host.
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:10.720]  Oh, I like it.
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:11.600]  Hashtag I need a carb.
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:12.720]  I think my edibles are working.
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:13.800]  I think the dabs are all working.
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:14.640]  Oh, there you go.
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:15.480]  Drop a dab, buddy.
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:16.320]  Instant karma.
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:17.160]  Ooh.
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.000]  And take hot dabs.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:21.480]  Oh yeah, that was a little warm, bro.
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:22.480]  That was a little bit warm.
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:23.800]  That's gonna feel it in your chest.
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:24.640]  Hot and hurty.
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:25.800]  Hashtag glory.
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:27.040]  Should I just turn off your mic?
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:29.400]  Should I just turn off your mic?
[02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:30.240]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:31.080]  You probably want to.
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:31.920]  All right, right now.
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:34.440]  Tell us how to find you on social media, Mike.
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:36.040]  At Nemopunk15 on Twitter
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.160]  or Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:39.560]  Yes, killin' it.
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:43.120]  He got it all.
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:44.920]  That was glorious.
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:45.760]  He got it all.
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:46.720]  That was glorious.
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:48.120]  You know, when I wrote this episode,
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:48.960]  when I wrote the notes,
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:50.280]  I really thought that everybody was limited
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:51.360]  to eight grams of purchasing,
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:53.120]  so it really changed the impact of my attitude
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:53.960]  and of this show,
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:56.040]  and I learned that that was only a recreational thing.
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:57.760]  I'm not so fired up about it now.
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.920]  This round of rules was pretty rational.
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:02.600]  There you go, you can still buy what you want, boo boo.
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:04.680]  Rational and reasonable.
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:05.920]  Did you say rationable?
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:06.760]  I did.
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:07.720]  Hashtag rational.
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:09.760]  Coughing, long syllable words are hard.
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:11.080]  You guys, we're making up our own words
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:11.920]  here on the podcast.
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:13.240]  Somebody call Webster.
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:15.240]  Get your own podcast, set up some microphones,
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:16.800]  get a feed, and you can make up your own words.
[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:17.840]  Just say them into the microphone.
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:19.120]  There's gotta be some sort of rule.
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:21.320]  If you say a word more than six or seven or 12 times,
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:22.440]  then it's gotta be a word now.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:23.280]  Sure.
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:24.120]  It's gotta work that way.
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:25.520]  People who attend vape competitions,
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:27.000]  I can say rationalable.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:28.120]  Yeah, makes sense.
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:29.280]  I'm gonna leave the vape kids alone.
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:30.720]  They have enough trouble.
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:32.240]  Have.
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:33.080]  Lindsay, my friend,
[02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:34.480]  how can people find you on social media?
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:36.320]  Let's hear about all 37 of your accounts.
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:37.480]  Lol, stop.
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:39.760]  Um, I have, let me see.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:42.360]  I love that you say lol in person.
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:43.200]  I know, I do.
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:44.040]  She says it out loud, yeah.
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.400]  I think she's not even really laughing.
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:46.240]  No.
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:47.760]  No, she's not laughing out loud,
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:49.120]  just like it is when you read it.
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:49.960]  It's not true.
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:50.800]  Yeah.
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:52.440]  Um, so I'm the,
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:53.280]  What?
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:54.120]  What?
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.080]  I'm the traveling stoner on Instagram and Periscope,
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:02.160]  and I am the travel stoner on Twitter.
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:06.440]  And yeah, hopefully the next time I'm on here,
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:09.640]  I'm in the midst of constructing my website.
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:11.680]  So hopefully the next time that I'm on here,
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:13.480]  I'll be able to talk about that.
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:14.760]  I would love to troll your website
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:16.600]  and share it with everybody.
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:17.880]  Please don't troll my website.
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:18.720]  You already know I will.
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:19.920]  I know.
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:21.320]  You guys, thank you both for coming on the show.
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:22.800]  Mike, I hope to get you on the next episode.
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:24.320]  Lindsay, we may have you here too.
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:26.280]  Somebody asked me a question and it directly says,
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:28.400]  I hope you and Mike can answer this.
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:30.680]  So Mike, I hope you're here for that one.
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:31.520]  Good listeners.
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:32.360]  Keep them coming.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:33.200]  Good listeners.
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:36.160]  Yeah, I'm always happy to come back whenever.
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:37.240]  The more feedback, the better.
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:39.080]  We know what to dig up
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:41.040]  and what's part of our ridiculous amount
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:42.560]  of cannabis knowledge to throw at you.
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:43.400]  That's the truth.
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:45.360]  We've got questions that you would like me to answer
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:46.920]  or Mike or even Lindsay.
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:47.800]  You can send me questions.
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:49.200]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:50.240]  Let me know what you'd like to know.
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.800]  We will talk about it here on the podcast.
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:52.960]  We'll give you a shout out.
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:55.840]  If we don't happen to know a good answer to your question,
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:57.960]  we'll find the person in the community who does
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:59.640]  and drag them onto the podcast.
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:01.880]  Mike, you are like my volleyball partner.
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:03.720]  You set them up and I will spike them, bro.
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:05.960]  Speaking of not knowing the answers to some things,
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:09.680]  people have asked me to do an episode about LED lighting.
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:12.040]  I personally have never grown with LEDs.
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:13.720]  I don't know shit about LEDs.
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:15.560]  I've got two friends that claim they're gonna drive
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.880]  from Denver and do an LED episode with me.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:18.720]  That a boy.
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:19.800]  I know one of them will show up.
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:20.680]  I know him personally.
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:21.760]  The other guy, I don't know.
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:23.320]  So I don't know if I can get him to drive.
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:25.400]  He lives about 130 miles from here.
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:26.880]  If he's willing to drive to the podcast,
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:28.080]  I'd love to get him on.
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:29.520]  So maybe I'll get both those cats on.
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.840]  We'll do a quick episode about LED lighting.
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:33.800]  Also, I'm trying to get in touch with the guy
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:36.720]  that makes the 315s.
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.760]  I think I commented on one of his Facebook posts.
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:40.880]  He did not reply.
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:42.600]  I'm not even sure it's the right dude.
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:43.880]  So I'm gonna get in touch with the dude
[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.280]  that makes the 315s.
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:47.320]  The LECs, the light emitting ceramics.
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:48.560]  We'll get that guy on the podcast.
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:50.600]  We'll talk about those in the future.
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:51.760]  Also, check this out.
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:53.800]  You guys have asked for an episode
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:55.600]  about cannabis and pregnancy.
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:58.960]  I have done a lot of research.
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:01.160]  There is so much stuff out there.
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:03.240]  I honestly am not qualified to do an episode
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:04.400]  about cannabis and pregnancy.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.560]  I'm not a doctor.
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:07.720]  I'm not a woman.
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:09.400]  And those are two things that I feel like
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:10.520]  I should be at least one of
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:12.800]  to do an episode about pregnancy.
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:17.640]  If you are either a doctor or a woman or a woman doctor,
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:20.320]  or if you've got experience with cannabis and pregnancy
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:21.160]  and you know more than I do
[02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:22.840]  and you're more comfortable with the subject,
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:23.800]  I'd love to get you on.
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:25.760]  We could talk all about it.
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:27.960]  The only thing I could throw in on that topic
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:29.920]  is the relevant laws you might be breaking
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:32.400]  and the repercussions you might face legally.
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.080]  And how that system works in places like Colorado.
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:40.520]  Because I used to read this all the time
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:43.720]  in patients' charts when I worked with locked up teens.
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:46.640]  So it's something that's gonna follow your kid around
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:47.640]  for that life.
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:48.760]  Oh man.
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:51.680]  If the hospital chooses to drug test you
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:54.160]  or your baby during the delivery.
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:55.960]  And if you've got dreadlocks or if you look like me,
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:58.520]  your kid's gonna get drug tested as soon as it comes out.
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:00.680]  For the most part, the system works.
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:03.840]  It's just if anybody involved in the birthing process,
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:05.560]  like that whole hospital stay,
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:09.320]  decides to, yeah, let's drug test that mom and that baby,
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:11.040]  then it happens.
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:13.840]  And it's just if anybody happens to make that decision.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:17.160]  The local anti-pot group down here,
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.040]  they're working with one of the hospitals.
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:22.360]  And they've got one month's worth of data
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:24.080]  and they're like, half the babies we tested
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.800]  came back positive for THC.
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:29.160]  And that's the end of their statement.
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:30.360]  If you dig a little deeper,
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.440]  10 babies were tested during that period,
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:34.640]  five of them came back positive for THC.
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:38.240]  Doesn't tell you what was up with the other five.
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:42.920]  But it's part of the national legalization conversation.
[02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:44.240]  Like it could be a cool episode
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:45.200]  if we could find the right people.
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:49.640]  Yeah, I don't have, that's not my wheelhouse, I guess.
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:52.000]  I literally just had to look up all of these laws
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.880]  because I worked in the legal industry
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:56.840]  and had a kid while I did that.
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:57.680]  Right.
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:50:58.880]  Yo, what do you do?
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:00.120]  Both of you have been bud tenders.
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:01.240]  Mike, I don't know if we should start,
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:02.400]  you're no longer a bud tender.
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:03.240]  You were a bud tender.
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:04.120]  Lindsay is a bud tender.
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:04.960]  What do you do?
[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:08.240]  A pregnant customer comes in and tries to buy cannabis.
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:09.840]  It's perfectly legal.
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:11.360]  To purchase it because you...
[02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:15.280]  It was like, what happened with us is that,
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:18.360]  I don't, are we going to do this for this show?
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:19.760]  It was just something you brought up randomly
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:21.960]  and all of a sudden this is like a two hour show now.
[02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:24.960]  But quick answer, what happens if I'm pregnant
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:26.520]  and I try to buy weed?
[02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:27.480]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:30.200]  Like you'd treat it like you're the customer, yeah.
[02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:32.080]  The girl in front of me in the dispensary
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:33.480]  the other day was pregnant
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:36.600]  and they served her no issues.
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:38.040]  Look, when my wife was pregnant,
[02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:39.880]  she stopped at the gas station a couple of times
[02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:40.760]  and bought me cigarettes.
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:41.800]  And like the second time she did it,
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:43.720]  she was like, I ain't fucking doing that again.
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:44.640]  I was like, what?
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:46.680]  Like, I just wasn't paying attention.
[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:48.920]  It's just something she's done for forever.
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:50.080]  And I looked up and I was like, what?
[02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:51.360]  And as I said, what?
[02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:53.080]  I was like, oh, people judge you.
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:51:55.080]  Yeah, that probably looks like shit.
[02:51:55.080 --> 02:51:58.040]  There's a whole bunch of stuff that your doctor tells you
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:00.120]  you shouldn't consume or do while you're pregnant.
[02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:01.840]  And it's all legal.
[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:03.000]  Well, not all.
[02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:05.840]  Cause like heroin and coke and shit are on that list too.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:10.200]  But like 99% of it's legal and it's just not advised.
[02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:12.720]  So.
[02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:16.880]  Well, if you are an expert, please.
[02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:19.640]  Yeah, or even have more education on it than I do
[02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:21.800]  and you're more comfortable talking about it than I am.
[02:52:21.800 --> 02:52:25.160]  I feel like that's more of a woman's topic
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:26.480]  and I should have a woman involved in this
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:27.520]  to help me through this
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:30.000]  so that I don't sound like a sexist dude that's uneducated.
[02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:34.160]  So let's get a doctor or a lady to come help me out
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:35.000]  with this one.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:35.840]  I'd love to do this episode.
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:36.680]  I'd love to do it.
[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:37.520]  A lot of people have questions.
