[00:00.640 --> 00:07.860]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[00:07.860 --> 00:08.860]  and growers.
[00:08.860 --> 00:13.260]  It is time for episode 496 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:13.260 --> 00:16.960]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:16.960 --> 00:21.380]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:21.380 --> 00:29.520]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:29.520 --> 00:32.920]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.920]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Cherry Fluff Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
[00:37.920 --> 00:39.200]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:39.200 --> 00:42.200]  This is a blend of bottle wash and cherry cush mints.
[00:42.200 --> 00:46.560]  The package describes the flavor as cherry marshmallow and leather musk.
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.600]  We have talked about this concentrate on the show before.
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.480]  I really enjoy the buzz and the flavor from this concentrate.
[00:53.480 --> 00:59.800]  On the back of the package, it says that this product does contain 69.84% total THC
[00:59.800 --> 01:03.600]  and non-detectable amounts of CBB.
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.480]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Cherry Fluff Full Spectrum
[01:08.480 --> 01:10.120]  Extract.
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to read some listener emails.
[01:13.520 --> 01:17.920]  Before we get to that point of the show, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.160]  from Patreon.
[01:20.160 --> 01:23.040]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out, and thank you
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.400]  to my friend Woodside195.
[01:25.400 --> 01:28.160]  I also want to send a giant thank you shout out to Bong Breath.
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.160]  I also want to send a giant thank you shout out to Steve Smith.
[01:31.160 --> 01:34.960]  I always want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast high five and thank you to Todd
[01:34.960 --> 01:35.960]  K.
[01:35.960 --> 01:39.600]  How about a big giant thank you to our buddy Dan The Indoor Man.
[01:39.600 --> 01:42.840]  Of course, I need to send a thank you shout out to Rue Lighting Tim.
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.160]  Always want to send a giant thank you shout out to Blackbird76.
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.080]  Of course, we owe a big high five and a thank you to OkieGrow720.
[01:50.080 --> 01:53.200]  I always need to send that big thank you shout out to Fat Rabbit.
[01:53.200 --> 01:57.640]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[01:57.640 --> 02:00.900]  you shout out to our friend Willie's Armpit.
[02:00.900 --> 02:05.360]  Big thanks, big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[02:05.360 --> 02:07.040]  I do appreciate the support.
[02:07.040 --> 02:13.120]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[02:13.120 --> 02:15.520]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.920]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.120]  All right, let's turn down that music and focus a little bit on this podcast.
[02:25.120 --> 02:26.500]  Let's start with this.
[02:26.500 --> 02:27.500]  Thank you.
[02:27.500 --> 02:28.560]  I feel like I am back.
[02:28.560 --> 02:32.020]  I did not miss an episode, but I feel like I kind of checked out mentally for a couple
[02:32.020 --> 02:33.020]  of episodes.
[02:33.020 --> 02:37.560]  I did have a death in my family that messed up my rhythm that took me out of the game,
[02:37.560 --> 02:38.980]  but I feel like I am back.
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.880]  I've got my head back on my shoulders.
[02:40.880 --> 02:42.720]  My life rhythms are back in order.
[02:42.720 --> 02:45.840]  I've got a lot of great friends and a lot of great family who supported me through that.
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.800]  So big thanks to everybody who supported me, kept me happy, kept me stoned, kept me smiling,
[02:50.800 --> 02:52.080]  kept me distracted.
[02:52.080 --> 02:53.080]  Big thanks, big respect.
[02:53.080 --> 02:55.000]  I appreciate all of that.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.080]  The friends around here, the family around here, but also the people that reached out
[02:58.080 --> 03:01.640]  online, the people that sent me emails, the people that sent me Instagram and Facebook
[03:01.640 --> 03:04.160]  messages, the people that sent me text messages.
[03:04.160 --> 03:06.080]  I received all of those messages.
[03:06.080 --> 03:09.360]  I did not reply to all of them because it was overwhelming, but thank you.
[03:09.360 --> 03:10.400]  I do appreciate it.
[03:10.400 --> 03:11.400]  So I am back.
[03:11.400 --> 03:12.520]  I'm back on my game.
[03:12.520 --> 03:13.960]  I've got my shit together.
[03:13.960 --> 03:16.760]  We'll get this podcast flowing again.
[03:16.760 --> 03:20.920]  And it is right on time because episode number 500 is coming up.
[03:20.920 --> 03:22.560]  I've been working on some ideas for that.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.440]  I've been asking you to share ideas.
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.600]  I've gotten a lot of great feedback on that, so I'm excited for episode 500.
[03:28.600 --> 03:35.480]  Then, shortly after episode 500, I will start the series of episodes where I describe the
[03:35.480 --> 03:39.280]  mix that I use in a commercial grow environment.
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.720]  I will go in thorough detail about my nutrient mix and how I feed my plants.
[03:44.720 --> 03:49.520]  That will happen shortly after episode 500, so stay tuned for that.
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.360]  Also, I've got a great episode about popping and twisting our plants.
[03:53.360 --> 03:56.040]  I've also got a great episode about lollipopping.
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.600]  I've got a lot of great stuff coming up, so I'm excited to be back in the game and bring
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.960]  you some quality podcasts.
[04:01.960 --> 04:05.880]  Again, thank you to everybody who supported me and kind of let me take a little bit of
[04:05.880 --> 04:08.320]  a break while I was having a rough time.
[04:08.360 --> 04:12.400]  I'm also getting excited because the Indo Expo is coming up really soon.
[04:12.400 --> 04:15.080]  That's right, the Indo Expo in Denver, Colorado.
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.880]  That is on January 25th and 26th at the Denver Mart in Denver.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.640]  Saturday is a business to business day.
[04:22.640 --> 04:24.800]  Sunday is open to the general public.
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.800]  If you need tickets, I suggest you get them now because the event will sell out.
[04:29.800 --> 04:35.400]  If you do get tickets, get there early because there is a long line to get into the building.
[04:35.400 --> 04:37.560]  The Indo Expo is a wonderful trade show.
[04:37.800 --> 04:38.800]  It's a very large event.
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.240]  Many of your favorite breeders will be there with the booth.
[04:41.240 --> 04:43.600]  I will be there at booth 533.
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.120]  Drop by, say hi, shake my hand, grab a few packs of fresh IRIE Genetics beans.
[04:49.120 --> 04:51.320]  I look forward to seeing you at the Indo Expo.
[04:51.320 --> 04:56.240]  All right, that music just politely faded itself out, so let's jump right into the email
[04:56.240 --> 04:58.760]  portion of this podcast.
[04:58.760 --> 05:02.680]  The first email in this episode comes from our friend, The Canna Crat.
[05:02.680 --> 05:04.000]  Big shout out to The Canna Crat.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.440]  The Canna Crat has been supporting the Grow From Your Heart podcast for quite a while.
[05:07.520 --> 05:09.520]  He's also a big supporter of the Dude Grow Show.
[05:09.520 --> 05:11.360]  So big shout out to The Canna Crat.
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.840]  Thank you for being a crucial member of the Cannabis and the Cannabis Podcast community.
[05:16.840 --> 05:18.640]  His message goes like this.
[05:18.640 --> 05:22.560]  Hey dude, I just wanted to take a minute to wish you a happy new year.
[05:22.560 --> 05:23.720]  Well, happy fucking new year, bro.
[05:23.720 --> 05:24.720]  Thanks for reaching out.
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.480]  He goes on to say, I hope 2020 brings you, your family, and your businesses great success
[05:29.480 --> 05:31.840]  and I have no doubt it will.
[05:31.840 --> 05:32.840]  Thank you, man.
[05:32.840 --> 05:33.840]  That means a lot to me.
[05:33.840 --> 05:34.840]  Happy new year to yourself as well.
[05:34.840 --> 05:39.160]  I hope 2020 blesses you, your family, your business, and your garden.
[05:39.160 --> 05:43.080]  And like you said, I have no doubt that your year will be amazing.
[05:43.080 --> 05:45.520]  You're a great fucking dude and you're killing it in the grow.
[05:45.520 --> 05:46.520]  Let's keep moving with the message.
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.920]  It says, also, I wanted to extend my thoughts about your recent loss again as your uncle
[05:51.920 --> 05:53.800]  seemed like a fun dude.
[05:53.800 --> 05:54.800]  Thank you, man.
[05:54.800 --> 05:55.800]  I appreciate that.
[05:55.800 --> 05:58.800]  All these kind messages really keep me fueled and it helps out.
[05:58.800 --> 06:03.160]  It goes on to say, you told the Metallica story on one of the very first episodes of
[06:03.160 --> 06:05.640]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast that I listened to.
[06:05.640 --> 06:07.360]  And I was like, this dude's cool.
[06:07.360 --> 06:09.680]  I should keep listening to this podcast.
[06:09.680 --> 06:12.860]  And now you're about to be at 500 episodes.
[06:12.860 --> 06:14.960]  And that's a great way to tie everything together.
[06:14.960 --> 06:19.800]  I do remember talking about my uncle and talking about Metallica early on in the podcast because
[06:19.800 --> 06:21.300]  that's influential shit to me.
[06:21.300 --> 06:22.300]  That's really important.
[06:22.300 --> 06:25.720]  So that's going to come up sometimes in a show or sometimes in conversation.
[06:25.720 --> 06:29.160]  So I love that you caught an episode where I talked about my uncle and I talked about
[06:29.160 --> 06:32.400]  Metallica and then I did it just again a couple of episodes ago.
[06:32.400 --> 06:34.520]  And you've been listening for quite a while and you're right, bro.
[06:34.520 --> 06:37.000]  We are approaching episode 500.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.080]  That means four episodes from now will be number 500.
[06:40.080 --> 06:45.360]  I actually just sent a text message to a few of your favorites that have been on the show,
[06:45.360 --> 06:48.720]  inviting them to come back and be on the show for 500.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.160]  We've got a group chat going on.
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.720]  We're going to get a date together.
[06:51.720 --> 06:56.120]  We'll sit down and record episode 500, hopefully by the end of the weekend.
[06:56.120 --> 07:00.440]  So 500 is coming up and yes, I am super excited about that.
[07:00.440 --> 07:01.440]  He says, congrats.
[07:01.480 --> 07:02.480]  Thank you, bro.
[07:02.480 --> 07:03.480]  I appreciate that.
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.480]  Thank you for being here for so long.
[07:04.480 --> 07:08.840]  Also, it goes on to say, so 500, you were asking for some ideas.
[07:08.840 --> 07:14.200]  Yes, I reached out on the podcast and I said, what do we do for episode 500?
[07:14.200 --> 07:17.620]  Should it be ceremonious or do we just smoke out and record a normal show just like we
[07:17.620 --> 07:18.780]  normally do?
[07:18.780 --> 07:21.960]  And here is some feedback from my friend, the Canicrat.
[07:21.960 --> 07:24.200]  He says, do it live.
[07:24.200 --> 07:25.600]  And that's a really good idea.
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.880]  It says, rotating cast, white mic, Clint, Jesse, a few hours of dabs, rambles, and general
[07:31.880 --> 07:33.960]  bullshitting about cannabis.
[07:33.960 --> 07:35.120]  That sounds like a great idea.
[07:35.120 --> 07:39.120]  One of the only downsides to that is I believe Jesse is in Mexico.
[07:39.120 --> 07:42.560]  Jesse likes to take random vacations down there in Mexico.
[07:42.560 --> 07:45.240]  He speaks better Spanish than he does English now.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.880]  He's got a thing for Mexico.
[07:46.880 --> 07:48.360]  I think it's tacos.
[07:48.360 --> 07:50.400]  He fucking loves tacos.
[07:50.400 --> 07:53.600]  Jesse is half taco at this point.
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.440]  So Jesse won't be around, but of course I did invite white mic to episode 500.
[07:57.440 --> 07:59.760]  It wouldn't be episode 500 without white mic.
[07:59.760 --> 08:02.320]  It would be rude as hell to not invite white mic.
[08:02.320 --> 08:03.520]  I feel he needs to be here.
[08:03.520 --> 08:05.600]  So I did invite Cracker Mike for that.
[08:05.600 --> 08:06.760]  Also I invited Clint.
[08:06.760 --> 08:08.720]  I also invited Double Door Dank.
[08:08.720 --> 08:13.760]  I'm waiting to see, let those three guys kind of lock in a date, get some stuff scheduled.
[08:13.760 --> 08:16.920]  And then I've got two or three other people I'm going to send a text to once I have a
[08:16.920 --> 08:21.120]  better idea of who is coming and how many chairs and microphones I've got left.
[08:21.320 --> 08:24.120]  I've got one or two more people that I do need to invite.
[08:24.120 --> 08:27.600]  I just want to lock in a date and tell these people this is when it happens because that's
[08:27.600 --> 08:28.600]  how they work.
[08:28.600 --> 08:30.120]  You know, some of your friends, you let them schedule.
[08:30.120 --> 08:33.720]  Some of them, you just have to tell them Tuesday at five and then they'll show up Tuesday at
[08:33.720 --> 08:36.400]  seven 30, just like you anticipated.
[08:36.400 --> 08:37.960]  You know how your stoner friends are.
[08:37.960 --> 08:38.960]  Let's move forward.
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.200]  I would love to get my friends, the crew, the iRyArmy over for the show.
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.520]  It is hard to schedule that, but if I can get a few people over and if I can get them
[08:47.520 --> 08:53.600]  all to agree to it, I would not have any issue with doing some of the podcast live.
[08:53.600 --> 08:57.960]  I may not do the actual podcast portion of the podcast live.
[08:57.960 --> 09:04.000]  I may do a pre-show dab session on Instagram live would be the easiest way for me to do
[09:04.000 --> 09:05.000]  that.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.480]  I could just set up the iPad, prop it up on something across the room so it gets the whole
[09:08.480 --> 09:10.040]  smoking section into the shot.
[09:10.040 --> 09:13.280]  And then we could just do a little dab session and say what's up to everybody on the live
[09:13.280 --> 09:17.200]  show and then we could turn off that and then actually record the actual podcast.
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.200]  We do a little bit of a bonus live party before maybe I'll get too stoned after that and I'll
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.000]  forget to turn off the camera and we may keep rolling and I may record the entire podcast
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.800]  episode and if it is not too challenging, I may piece it into a YouTube video.
[09:31.800 --> 09:37.440]  But honestly, video editing is not my favorite thing and it is very time consuming and I've
[09:37.440 --> 09:39.640]  got a lot going on this month with the Indo Expo.
[09:39.640 --> 09:45.400]  So I make no promises for video, but I may do a live chat before you guys, these dabs
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.440]  got me fucking rambling.
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.840]  I've had plenty of caffeine, I smoked that cherry fluff and I cannot shut the fuck up.
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.320]  This is going to be a longer podcast than I anticipated.
[09:54.320 --> 09:56.080]  You are welcome.
[09:56.080 --> 09:59.200]  Canicrat goes on to say, general bullshitting about cannabis.
[09:59.200 --> 10:00.360]  Yes, that is what we do.
[10:00.360 --> 10:04.500]  Then he says, YouTube on a Saturday evening or something, just my two cents.
[10:04.500 --> 10:09.720]  The two days I offered everybody to do the show are the coming Friday and Saturday.
[10:09.720 --> 10:11.160]  We had a couple of people say Friday.
[10:11.160 --> 10:13.120]  I think one person said Saturday.
[10:13.120 --> 10:14.380]  So we will dial that in.
[10:14.380 --> 10:19.340]  I will do my best to post to social media and let people know that I am about to go
[10:19.340 --> 10:20.340]  live.
[10:20.340 --> 10:22.340]  Then he wraps that up and says, just my two cents.
[10:22.340 --> 10:25.180]  Hey bro, your two cents is heavy around here.
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.220]  You've been around for a while.
[10:26.220 --> 10:27.220]  You've proven yourself.
[10:27.220 --> 10:29.980]  I know you are capable of rational thoughts.
[10:29.980 --> 10:32.580]  So your two cents goes a long way.
[10:32.580 --> 10:33.580]  Thanks for reaching out, bro.
[10:33.580 --> 10:39.500]  He goes on to say, I've had a great run with iRegenetics in 2019 and will strive to be
[10:39.500 --> 10:44.060]  an even better grower and human in 2020.
[10:44.060 --> 10:45.060]  Nice dude.
[10:45.060 --> 10:46.940]  Then he signed with his real name.
[10:46.940 --> 10:51.260]  I don't know if he wants his real name out there, but big thanks, big respect to the
[10:51.260 --> 10:52.460]  CannaCrat.
[10:52.460 --> 10:56.500]  If you're on Instagram or Cannabuzz, I highly recommend you check out an application called
[10:56.500 --> 10:57.500]  Cannabuzz.
[10:57.500 --> 10:58.500]  Here's a shameless plug for Cannabuzz.
[10:58.500 --> 11:02.420]  Then we'll wrap that up with a shameless plug for my buddy, the Cannacrat.
[11:02.420 --> 11:04.940]  Cannabuzz is a cannabis-friendly social media application.
[11:04.940 --> 11:10.220]  You cannot buy, sell, or trade cannabis, but you can post your cannabis-related content
[11:10.220 --> 11:11.460]  to Cannabuzz.
[11:11.460 --> 11:14.040]  You can post your cannabis weed photos.
[11:14.040 --> 11:15.560]  You can post your dab videos.
[11:15.560 --> 11:16.920]  You can post your bong rip videos.
[11:16.920 --> 11:19.760]  You can post your videos of yourself smoking a joint and being silly.
[11:19.760 --> 11:24.320]  Any of those photos that Instagram has been taking down, Cannabuzz invites you to come
[11:24.320 --> 11:25.320]  post.
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.920]  Cannabuzz is a free application.
[11:26.920 --> 11:28.320]  It's available for your Android.
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.960]  It's available for your iPhone, and you can even access the application through the website.
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.640]  I encourage you to join Cannabuzz.
[11:36.640 --> 11:38.920]  Then once you've joined Cannabuzz, give me a follow.
[11:38.920 --> 11:42.080]  I'm iRee underscore genetics on Cannabuzz.
[11:42.320 --> 11:48.320]  Once you're all set up on Cannabuzz, I recommend you follow the underscore canna underscore
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.920]  crat, the Cannacrat on Instagram and the Cannacrat on Cannabuzz.
[11:52.920 --> 11:56.320]  He's been posting some amazing ganja photos.
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.240]  He's got a beautiful grow of the profit growing, and it looks amazing.
[12:00.240 --> 12:03.240]  I can almost smell it through his photos.
[12:03.240 --> 12:07.800]  I keep scratching my phone screen and holding it up to my face, just wishing I could get
[12:07.800 --> 12:10.400]  some scratch and sniff Smell-O-Vision technology.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.560]  You guys, make sure you give the Cannacrat a big follow.
[12:13.560 --> 12:14.560]  Shout out, bro.
[12:14.560 --> 12:16.640]  Your plants really do look fucking super good, man.
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.120]  All right, let's keep moving forward because I am high and rambly.
[12:20.120 --> 12:24.600]  This next email comes from our friend who calls themselves Dude Dank, and it goes a
[12:24.600 --> 12:25.840]  lot like this.
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.160]  Hey, Jeff, it's Dude Dank here again.
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.440]  I just thought that since you asked for ideas, since you have episode 500 coming up and the
[12:34.440 --> 12:41.480]  DGC have episode 1000 coming up, why not collaborate and do an anniversary show together
[12:41.480 --> 12:44.720]  and pull off a bit of a party?
[12:44.720 --> 12:47.360]  That is a cool fucking idea.
[12:47.360 --> 12:48.960]  That would be a really good time.
[12:48.960 --> 12:50.560]  He said, just an idea.
[12:50.560 --> 12:51.560]  Thought it might be good.
[12:51.560 --> 12:52.560]  That's a really good idea.
[12:52.560 --> 12:55.000]  He said, I support and love both shows.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.760]  Hey, thank you for the great idea.
[12:56.760 --> 12:59.600]  I support and love both shows as well.
[12:59.600 --> 13:01.880]  Big shout out to the full DGC crew.
[13:01.880 --> 13:03.240]  Big shout out to the Dude, of course.
[13:03.240 --> 13:04.480]  Big shout out to Scotty.
[13:04.480 --> 13:07.000]  Big shout out to Guru and everybody behind the scenes.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.800]  I know there are a lot of folks that make that show happen that we don't get to see,
[13:09.800 --> 13:11.440]  that we don't talk about a lot.
[13:11.440 --> 13:12.720]  Let's give them some love right now.
[13:12.720 --> 13:16.440]  Big thanks, big shout out, big fist bump to all of the folks behind the scenes at the
[13:16.440 --> 13:18.640]  Dude Grow show that we never get to see.
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.160]  I really do love the idea of doing a party, kind of an episode, us doing 500 and them
[13:24.160 --> 13:26.280]  doing number 1000.
[13:26.280 --> 13:32.880]  The problem is the Dude Grows studio where Scotty is, is about four hours away from my
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.720]  location and then the Dude is in Canada.
[13:36.720 --> 13:40.600]  If we wanted to do something like that, it would take a lot of planning and a lot of
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.720]  internet technology and that would basically eliminate the possibility of getting my crew
[13:45.720 --> 13:47.840]  here to be able to be on the show as well.
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.680]  We would need too many computers, too many cameras, too much equipment, too much preparation.
[13:52.680 --> 13:55.240]  It would be a lot of work and I don't have any gurus.
[13:55.240 --> 14:00.440]  I don't have any warehouse Kyles or any Aaron's or anybody like that to come do my shit for
[14:00.440 --> 14:01.440]  me.
[14:01.440 --> 14:02.640]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast is all me.
[14:02.640 --> 14:04.200]  It's a one man show over here.
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.000]  So I don't have the technology, the gear or the crew for that, but it's a cool idea.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.080]  I can see it in my head.
[14:10.080 --> 14:12.040]  It would be the greatest party ever.
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.880]  We do actually have a couple of events that become the Dude Grows event, but it is also
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.360]  a lot of the Grow From Your Heart podcast listeners, a lot of the IRI Genetics crew,
[14:22.360 --> 14:24.560]  the IRI Army, is all the same people.
[14:24.560 --> 14:26.360]  We all show up to the same event.
[14:26.360 --> 14:29.140]  Those events are thrown by the Dude Grows crew.
[14:29.140 --> 14:34.480]  It is the Dude Grows Cup around 420 and then we get together again around 710 and we do
[14:34.480 --> 14:37.780]  the Dude Grows concentration celebration.
[14:37.780 --> 14:42.320]  So we've got two great events thrown by the Dude Grows crew, by the Dude Grows show.
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.820]  Big shout out to the dude for the Dude Grows cup and big shout out to Scotty for the Dude
[14:46.820 --> 14:49.180]  Grows concentration celebration.
[14:49.180 --> 14:54.200]  But at those events, it becomes a big Dude Grows crew, Grow From Your Heart podcast crew,
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.720]  IRI Army crew, sort of a gathering because we're all listening to the same shows.
[14:58.720 --> 14:59.880]  We all support the same people.
[14:59.880 --> 15:01.160]  We're all the same community.
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.200]  We are all on the same team and we all have the same goal.
[15:04.200 --> 15:06.520]  So we have a great party, which is coming up.
[15:06.520 --> 15:11.800]  That wasn't going to be a plug for the event, but the Dude Grows Cup is coming up in April.
[15:11.800 --> 15:13.880]  Stay tuned for announcements and details.
[15:13.880 --> 15:17.440]  Make sure you listen to the Dude Grows show for all of the information on that one.
[15:17.440 --> 15:19.280]  Shout out to all my friends at the Dude Grows show.
[15:19.280 --> 15:21.380]  Once again, much love and much respect.
[15:21.380 --> 15:25.700]  He wraps up this message with, take care, Dude Dank UK.
[15:25.700 --> 15:29.460]  Hey, my friend, Dude Dank from the UK.
[15:29.460 --> 15:31.020]  Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[15:31.020 --> 15:35.940]  Thank you for all of the support and thank you for the great suggestions for episode
[15:35.940 --> 15:36.940]  500.
[15:36.940 --> 15:39.300]  I have another email right in front of me.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.460]  There's no need to stop.
[15:40.460 --> 15:41.460]  Let's keep moving.
[15:41.460 --> 15:46.740]  The next message comes from my buddy Dick Goals and it goes just like this.
[15:46.740 --> 15:48.740]  It says, Merry Christmas, Rasta Jeff.
[15:48.740 --> 15:50.540]  Merry Christmas back at you, my friend.
[15:50.700 --> 15:55.900]  It goes on to say, thank you for all of your wisdom, conversation, inspiration, and seeds.
[15:55.900 --> 15:57.420]  Wow, that's amazing.
[15:57.420 --> 15:58.420]  You're welcome.
[15:58.420 --> 16:01.780]  Thank you for noticing, wisdom, conversation, and inspiration.
[16:01.780 --> 16:04.460]  Yeah, I guess I do deliver all of those.
[16:04.460 --> 16:05.460]  Thank you.
[16:05.460 --> 16:08.860]  That is a great compliment and thank you for noticing and pointing that out and complimenting
[16:08.860 --> 16:09.860]  me.
[16:09.860 --> 16:10.860]  That is fucking cool.
[16:10.860 --> 16:11.860]  That's a great compliment.
[16:11.860 --> 16:16.060]  It goes on to say, oh, and your work preserving and improving cannabis genetics.
[16:16.060 --> 16:17.060]  That's important.
[16:17.060 --> 16:19.020]  Hey, thank you for noticing, my friend.
[16:19.020 --> 16:21.780]  That is a huge cluster of great compliments.
[16:21.780 --> 16:23.420]  I appreciate that.
[16:23.420 --> 16:24.420]  Perfectly timed.
[16:24.420 --> 16:25.420]  Thank you.
[16:25.420 --> 16:29.580]  It goes on to say, I wouldn't be as inspired to grow and I certainly wouldn't be doing
[16:29.580 --> 16:36.140]  as well so early on without the hours of fantastic content you put out there.
[16:36.140 --> 16:37.380]  That is awesome to hear.
[16:37.380 --> 16:38.380]  Thank you.
[16:38.380 --> 16:43.940]  I am delighted to hear that my little work I've done sitting here and writing and then
[16:43.940 --> 16:50.500]  I'm delighted to hear that that effort has made your grow experience more enjoyable and
[16:50.500 --> 16:51.780]  more successful.
[16:51.780 --> 16:53.460]  I think those two things may come together.
[16:53.460 --> 16:57.900]  The enjoyment and success may reflect each other, but it does mean a lot for me to hear
[16:57.900 --> 17:01.580]  that you feel like you did better because of the little effort I put out.
[17:01.580 --> 17:04.940]  You had to put a lot of effort out as well, my friend, so it was a group effort.
[17:04.940 --> 17:05.940]  There is more to this.
[17:05.940 --> 17:10.740]  It goes on to say, in an industry quickly becoming corporate where people increasingly
[17:10.740 --> 17:15.500]  try to hide their knowledge as trade secret, you put it almost all out there and thus
[17:15.500 --> 17:19.060]  improve the quality of cannabis for everyone.
[17:19.060 --> 17:20.060]  Exactly.
[17:20.060 --> 17:21.380]  That is kind of my goal.
[17:21.380 --> 17:23.660]  I feel like I learn rather quickly.
[17:23.660 --> 17:25.740]  I learn things that I care about rather quickly.
[17:25.740 --> 17:27.260]  I've got a very absorbent brain.
[17:27.260 --> 17:29.260]  I'm not sure if that's the appropriate terms for it.
[17:29.260 --> 17:32.700]  I talk about how smart I am and I don't even know the fucking words to use for it.
[17:32.700 --> 17:35.700]  I feel like I can retain knowledge that I care about quite quickly.
[17:35.700 --> 17:37.460]  Obviously, I care a lot about cannabis.
[17:37.460 --> 17:39.500]  I care a lot about growing cannabis.
[17:39.500 --> 17:42.100]  I care a lot about smoking, consuming cannabis.
[17:42.100 --> 17:44.620]  I absolutely care a lot about breeding cannabis.
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.700]  I just have a big passion for cannabis.
[17:46.700 --> 17:48.420]  It's a big part of my life.
[17:48.420 --> 17:50.260]  I feel like it has taken me very far.
[17:50.260 --> 17:51.940]  I feel like I'm successful in life.
[17:51.940 --> 17:55.340]  Not a lot of people can actually say they feel successful.
[17:55.340 --> 18:01.400]  I feel like I'm doing what I enjoy doing and I'm surviving semi-comfortably by doing something
[18:01.400 --> 18:02.700]  that I have passion for.
[18:02.700 --> 18:04.340]  I don't feel like I'm working my ass off.
[18:04.340 --> 18:08.780]  I work very hard, but since I love it and have passion for it, I don't feel like I'm
[18:08.780 --> 18:09.880]  slaving away.
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.020]  Working for myself and doing something that I have passion for, it just feels like I'm
[18:14.020 --> 18:17.100]  having the best day every day when I'm working.
[18:17.100 --> 18:19.540]  I'm doing little air quotes when I say the word working.
[18:19.540 --> 18:23.460]  It is work, but it's not work that a lot of people have to endure.
[18:23.460 --> 18:27.340]  I feel like I'm very, and I hate to sound cliche right now, but I am very blessed.
[18:27.340 --> 18:31.740]  I am very grateful for the fact that I don't have to work for a corporation or that I don't
[18:31.740 --> 18:34.820]  have to have one of those nine to five jobs that everybody hates.
[18:34.820 --> 18:37.260]  I'm very grateful that I don't have to do that.
[18:37.260 --> 18:42.460]  I feel like since this plant took me so far, since I had such great passion for the plant,
[18:42.460 --> 18:47.300]  since I was able to learn so quickly and there was such a need for this knowledge, I feel
[18:47.300 --> 18:52.020]  like it was my duty and my job to put all of this stuff I learned out there.
[18:52.020 --> 18:55.740]  There is so much bad advice on the internet.
[18:55.740 --> 19:03.220]  There are so many bad growers offering what looks like expert advice online, and a lot
[19:03.220 --> 19:06.380]  of that stuff is going to cause more problems.
[19:06.500 --> 19:09.140]  I felt like it was partly my responsibility.
[19:09.140 --> 19:10.140]  I've got a big mouth.
[19:10.140 --> 19:11.380]  I can't stop talking.
[19:11.380 --> 19:13.380]  I've got a huge passion for cannabis.
[19:13.380 --> 19:15.020]  I've got all this beautiful gear.
[19:15.020 --> 19:18.740]  I felt like something came together and said, you need to put this information out there
[19:18.740 --> 19:23.780]  for everybody to be able to grow the quality cannabis that you and your friends are producing
[19:23.780 --> 19:25.100]  in your area.
[19:25.100 --> 19:28.820]  I was around the Colorado medical marijuana market early.
[19:28.820 --> 19:31.940]  I was growing in another state before it was legal.
[19:31.940 --> 19:34.700]  We won't talk too much about that, but it may have been happening.
[19:34.740 --> 19:36.460]  I had a lot of experience.
[19:36.460 --> 19:38.260]  I was a little bit ahead of the game.
[19:38.260 --> 19:41.980]  I may have been doing it before it was legal, so I had a little bit of practice.
[19:41.980 --> 19:46.180]  As soon as it was legal, all I had to do is go, look, I know how to grow.
[19:46.180 --> 19:48.180]  Everybody needed help and needed guidance.
[19:48.180 --> 19:53.080]  I was more than happy to return that karma back to the world because I got away with
[19:53.080 --> 19:55.340]  illegal grows in illegal states.
[19:55.340 --> 19:59.340]  I started my cannabis career as a black market, just a joint seller.
[19:59.340 --> 20:02.020]  I worked at a restaurant and I sold joints to the kitchen crew.
[20:02.020 --> 20:04.580]  Eventually, I sold eights to the kitchen crew.
[20:04.580 --> 20:07.900]  Eventually, I sold a bunch of quarters to all of my friends.
[20:07.900 --> 20:09.900]  Eventually, I was selling quarter pounds.
[20:09.900 --> 20:11.940]  Then you're just selling a bunch of pounds.
[20:11.940 --> 20:15.100]  Then you're doing crazy shit that you don't want to be doing anymore.
[20:15.100 --> 20:16.500]  Now those days are over for me.
[20:16.500 --> 20:19.260]  I'm here in the legal cannabis industry.
[20:19.260 --> 20:24.380]  I feel like I got away with a bunch of shit that I may or may not allegedly have done
[20:24.380 --> 20:26.820]  back in the day involving cannabis.
[20:26.820 --> 20:32.460]  Now I feel like my karma is to put this knowledge back out here and help everybody produce top
[20:32.460 --> 20:35.580]  shelf medicine or recreational cannabis.
[20:35.580 --> 20:37.460]  I believe that's medicine also.
[20:37.460 --> 20:41.980]  I feel better after I consume cannabis and that means it's probably medicinal in some
[20:41.980 --> 20:42.980]  sort of way.
[20:42.980 --> 20:45.220]  It's absolutely therapeutic for me.
[20:45.220 --> 20:47.860]  Maybe we'll just make up a new term, therapeutic cannabis.
[20:47.860 --> 20:51.380]  It's right in the middle between recreational and medicinal.
[20:51.380 --> 20:53.940]  My first dab is medicinal marijuana.
[20:53.940 --> 20:56.340]  My second dab is medicinal marijuana.
[20:56.380 --> 20:57.940]  My third one is therapeutic.
[20:57.940 --> 20:59.700]  My fourth one, that's recreational.
[20:59.700 --> 21:03.860]  You guys, I'm fucking rambling from the recreational dabs I've been taking.
[21:03.860 --> 21:07.260]  Let's finish up this email because I got off way on a tangent there.
[21:07.260 --> 21:10.660]  It says, I hope you have a fantastic Christmas with your friends and family.
[21:10.660 --> 21:15.260]  I cannot wait to shake your hand and say hello at the Indo Expo.
[21:15.260 --> 21:17.060]  Dick Goals, I'm excited to meet you, my friend.
[21:17.060 --> 21:18.860]  We've been talking online for quite a while.
[21:18.860 --> 21:21.620]  I'm very excited to shake your hand.
[21:21.620 --> 21:26.100]  He wraps it up with, thanks again for all you do for myself and the cannabis community.
[21:26.860 --> 21:28.700]  It doesn't go unnoticed.
[21:28.700 --> 21:29.700]  Thank you, brother.
[21:29.700 --> 21:30.700]  That does mean a lot.
[21:30.700 --> 21:33.900]  They wrap it up with best, then they sign it, from Rich.
[21:33.900 --> 21:35.300]  That's my buddy Dick Goals.
[21:35.300 --> 21:39.700]  Big shout out to Dick Goals out there in the world, having to live with the name Dick Goals.
[21:39.700 --> 21:42.900]  It's probably fun sometimes, probably fucking horrible sometimes.
[21:42.900 --> 21:46.300]  Hey, Dick, thank you for all the love and all the support.
[21:46.300 --> 21:50.620]  Thanks for noticing that I am doing a lot for the cannabis community.
[21:50.620 --> 21:51.940]  Thank you for the great email.
[21:51.940 --> 21:54.460]  I hope you have a great Christmas and a great new year.
[21:54.460 --> 21:58.220]  I look forward to shaking your hand at the Indo Expo.
[21:58.220 --> 22:02.140]  That sounds like another great opportunity for a shameless plug for the Indo Expo.
[22:02.140 --> 22:07.380]  That's right, January 25th and 26th at the Denver Mart in Denver, Colorado.
[22:07.380 --> 22:09.540]  It is the Indo Expo.
[22:09.540 --> 22:12.380]  January 25th is business to business day.
[22:12.380 --> 22:15.420]  January 26th is open to the general public.
[22:15.420 --> 22:17.340]  You do need to get your tickets in advance.
[22:17.340 --> 22:18.860]  I know I keep saying that.
[22:18.860 --> 22:21.020]  The event will sell out.
[22:21.020 --> 22:25.500]  So get there early because the lines do get long rather quickly.
[22:25.500 --> 22:28.060]  Come find I read genetics at booth 533.
[22:28.060 --> 22:32.140]  Drop by, shake my hand, take a selfie, say hello, grab some I read genetics.
[22:32.140 --> 22:35.140]  I look forward to meeting everybody at the Indo Expo.
[22:35.140 --> 22:36.300]  Don't be shy, you guys.
[22:36.300 --> 22:40.540]  I don't want to get an email or a tweet or a text message or an Instagram message from
[22:40.540 --> 22:44.260]  you the day after the Indo Expo saying, walked by your booth, bro.
[22:44.260 --> 22:45.260]  You looked busy.
[22:45.260 --> 22:46.900]  Would have been cool to shake your hand, bro.
[22:46.900 --> 22:47.900]  Come shake my hand.
[22:47.900 --> 22:48.900]  That's what I'm there for.
[22:48.900 --> 22:52.700]  Even if you got to wait in line for a couple of seconds, come say hi, come shake my hand.
[22:52.700 --> 22:53.700]  Don't be shy.
[22:53.700 --> 22:54.700]  Say what's up.
[22:54.700 --> 22:55.700]  I want to be your friend.
[22:55.700 --> 22:56.700]  Also, I know I'm six five.
[22:56.700 --> 22:58.620]  I got dreads to my fucking knees almost.
[22:58.620 --> 22:59.940]  And I may look a little crazy.
[22:59.940 --> 23:00.940]  I'm a nice dude.
[23:00.940 --> 23:01.940]  I want to be your friend.
[23:01.940 --> 23:02.940]  I won't bite.
[23:02.940 --> 23:03.940]  All right.
[23:03.940 --> 23:04.940]  Come say hi.
[23:04.940 --> 23:05.940]  All right.
[23:05.940 --> 23:06.940]  Podcast world.
[23:06.940 --> 23:07.940]  My voice is burning out.
[23:07.940 --> 23:08.940]  I feel like this was a good Thursday show.
