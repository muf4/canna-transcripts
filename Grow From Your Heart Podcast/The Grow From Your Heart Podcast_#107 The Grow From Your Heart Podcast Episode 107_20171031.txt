[00:22.610 --> 00:26.910]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.

[00:29.190 --> 00:31.890]  if you're an old school smoker or a hardcore dabber,
[00:32.070 --> 00:34.890]  if you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious about the current
[00:34.890 --> 00:38.970]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:38.990 --> 00:41.290]  My friends call me Ross the Jeff. I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[00:41.530 --> 00:43.370]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you.
[00:43.370 --> 00:46.210]  Shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band, big shout out to Kat,
[00:46.570 --> 00:49.970]  Coot and the entire mystic roots crew. What's up everybody.
[00:49.970 --> 00:51.970]  I hope you guys are having a wonderful evening, a wonderful morning,
[00:51.970 --> 00:53.970]  a wonderful afternoon, whatever time it is, no matter what,
[00:54.230 --> 00:55.650]  no matter where you are, no matter what you're doing,
[00:55.650 --> 00:57.850]  I hope you're smoking something tasty. Hope you got a fat dab.
[00:57.890 --> 01:00.850]  Hope you got a joint rolled. Hope you got something like that going on.
[01:01.050 --> 01:03.810]  We're coming to you on November 19th, sitting across the table from me.
[01:03.810 --> 01:06.490]  Joining us again is our good buddy, white Mike. How you doing today, bro?
[01:07.290 --> 01:09.370]  How you doing buddy? Doing good, man. Doing good. Thanks for asking.
[01:09.370 --> 01:12.050]  I'm going to point this microphone a little more at your face. There you go.
[01:12.130 --> 01:15.210]  Just get the words into it a little more. That's all. Back in our rhythm. Yes,
[01:15.210 --> 01:15.530]  yes.
[01:15.530 --> 01:18.010]  I'm going to drop this music out a little bit and we will get down to business.
[01:18.010 --> 01:20.690]  How you doing today, bro? Doing all right. Right on, man. Thanks for coming.
[01:20.850 --> 01:23.210]  Thanks for taking time away from the new youngster to come see me.
[01:23.690 --> 01:26.570]  He's sleeping right now. So I get some away time.
[01:27.250 --> 01:30.090]  I hear he's had a little head cold, so I hope the little dude gets better really
[01:30.090 --> 01:33.810]  soon. Yeah, he's on the mend. I hope he didn't share it with everybody. Nope,
[01:34.130 --> 01:36.850]  not yet, but we can feel it coming. Oh gosh. All right.
[01:36.850 --> 01:38.650]  So I'm going to take my vitamins. You guys, if you're listening,
[01:38.650 --> 01:43.130]  take your vitamins so that you don't take your vitamins. Take some emergency.
[01:43.170 --> 01:46.890]  Wait, nobody pays me. Just take whatever vitamins you take. Take those. Yeah.
[01:46.930 --> 01:49.610]  If you have a vitamin company that would like to sponsor a podcast,
[01:49.610 --> 01:52.210]  you know how to find me. Shout out to not getting sick. Yes.
[01:52.210 --> 01:53.970]  Shout out to good health. You guys take good care of yourself.
[01:53.970 --> 01:54.730]  Make sure you hydrate.
[01:54.730 --> 01:57.730]  If you're dabbing and smoking a bunch of cannabis or a bunch of hash or eating
[01:57.730 --> 02:00.370]  edibles or whatever you're doing, you need to hydrate. Drink more water.
[02:00.370 --> 02:04.410]  Most of us are dehydrated anyway. Skip that soda. Drink a bottle of water.
[02:04.530 --> 02:07.850]  I know it sounds crazy. It's ludicrous, but hydrate. It's good for you.
[02:08.050 --> 02:11.770]  It's really good for you. All right, you guys. Um, I need to mention something.
[02:11.770 --> 02:15.570]  I put out an episode number one Oh six went up on stitcher, uh,
[02:15.570 --> 02:18.170]  on Thursday. We actually went up today, Thursday the 19th.
[02:18.650 --> 02:21.250]  And for some reason, stitcher is failing on picking it up.
[02:21.250 --> 02:23.570]  It's only got one second of the show posted.
[02:23.570 --> 02:26.610]  So I've emailed stitcher and let them know that there's an issue. Uh,
[02:26.650 --> 02:29.130]  usually stitcher just goes and corrects it really quickly.
[02:29.130 --> 02:32.610]  The show is it's available on iTunes. It's available on my website.
[02:32.610 --> 02:35.530]  I read genetics colorado.com. Um,
[02:35.850 --> 02:38.290]  for some reason it did not work on stitcher. Uh,
[02:38.290 --> 02:40.930]  it's stitchers problem I can tell because it's playing on my iPhone.
[02:40.930 --> 02:44.010]  It's playing on my computer. Uh, it just will not play through stitcher.
[02:44.290 --> 02:48.130]  So I apologize if you guys did not get to hear episode one Oh six, uh,
[02:48.130 --> 02:51.050]  I made a very special and a very important announcement. Uh,
[02:51.050 --> 02:53.530]  I recorded the podcast from my car while I was driving.
[02:53.530 --> 02:55.570]  So it's one of those and you do want to listen to it.
[02:55.810 --> 02:59.370]  So if you're a stitcher listener and you have not gotten to hear episode number
[02:59.370 --> 03:01.370]  one Oh six with a very special announcement,
[03:01.650 --> 03:06.650]  I encourage you to either go to my website or go to iTunes and check out episode
[03:06.650 --> 03:09.610]  number one Oh six. It's I read genetics colorado.com.
[03:09.890 --> 03:12.850]  Click on the grow from your heart podcast tab and it'll be right there.
[03:12.890 --> 03:15.730]  Number one Oh six. Very special announcement. Give that a listen.
[03:15.970 --> 03:17.890]  I think you will appreciate what I had to say.
[03:18.610 --> 03:21.770]  I do apologize for stitcher not picking up the episode. I've emailed them.
[03:22.130 --> 03:25.890]  I just got to wait for them to fix it. That's pretty much what we can do.
[03:27.250 --> 03:28.330]  All right. I got to reach for my phone.
[03:28.330 --> 03:31.010]  I've got one more thing I want to talk about before we start getting down to
[03:31.050 --> 03:34.450]  the heart of the show. Got to unlock the phone here. You guys,
[03:34.450 --> 03:39.090]  I got a screenshot of something. Um, so we put a lot of work into this podcast.
[03:40.090 --> 03:41.850]  I take time out of my day. I take time out of my life.
[03:41.850 --> 03:44.730]  Mike takes time away from his family to come over here and record. Uh,
[03:44.730 --> 03:47.210]  Mike works 40 something hours a week in the spot.
[03:47.210 --> 03:50.490]  So getting him to come over for an hour is actually a little effort. Uh,
[03:50.490 --> 03:54.290]  I got an email that makes all of our time, all of our effort worthwhile. Uh,
[03:54.290 --> 03:57.250]  these are the emails that really make it worth, uh, putting in the energy.
[03:57.250 --> 04:01.370]  So this came from somebody we'll just call it Mike. Oh. And he says,
[04:01.410 --> 04:04.170]  the podcast is great. Best show I've listened, uh,
[04:04.170 --> 04:05.490]  best show and I've listened to them all.
[04:05.490 --> 04:09.210]  Hoping you will do more shows with longer content. Like the earlier episodes,
[04:09.210 --> 04:13.490]  I would like to see a pest management episode and more BHO shows. Uh,
[04:13.490 --> 04:16.930]  I'm in Michigan and took a 10 year hiatus from growing after cloning the shit
[04:16.930 --> 04:21.410]  out of super skunk seed smuggled back from Amsterdam in 93 shit sure changed
[04:21.410 --> 04:23.650]  since oh four had to learn about her. Uh,
[04:23.650 --> 04:26.250]  he lists a bunch of stuff he had to learn about and then he keeps it going for a
[04:26.250 --> 04:29.810]  minute and he says, I've listened to all the grow shows. Uh, Adam done, dude,
[04:29.810 --> 04:32.930]  grows Kyle Cushman. And then he says, yours is the best by far.
[04:32.930 --> 04:36.890]  A great mix of knowledge, humor, and irreverence in a very easy to listen to
[04:36.890 --> 04:40.730]  style. I'm almost done re-listening to the entire series again.
[04:41.290 --> 04:45.850]  Great job, brother, man. I'll do a dab for you. Signed Mike. Dude.
[04:46.250 --> 04:50.050]  Thanks Mike. That's awesome. That is awesome. He says we are the best podcast.
[04:50.210 --> 04:53.410]  I'm not trying to compete with anybody, but if I'm being called the best,
[04:53.410 --> 04:55.490]  then that is fucking awesome. I appreciate that. Mike,
[04:55.490 --> 04:59.890]  thanks for listening to the podcast. Um, the email is turned off over here.
[04:59.890 --> 05:02.610]  This email coil needs to be replaced, but when we do a dab,
[05:02.610 --> 05:05.210]  the next step that we do is for Mike. Uh, and I've got,
[05:05.290 --> 05:06.770]  I get plenty of emails like that,
[05:06.770 --> 05:09.290]  but it was time to read one on the air and say, dude, check this out.
[05:09.330 --> 05:10.170]  This is what comes.
[05:10.450 --> 05:14.250]  I probably get an email or a text message or an Instagram message or a Facebook
[05:14.250 --> 05:16.970]  message once a day saying thanks for the podcast.
[05:16.970 --> 05:21.450]  So that kind of stuff makes it all worth the time and energy and effort that we
[05:21.450 --> 05:23.330]  do to put in this podcast. Thank you guys for listening.
[05:23.370 --> 05:24.850]  That's what I'm trying to say. Thanks for the email.
[05:24.850 --> 05:27.930]  If you want to send me an email, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[05:27.930 --> 05:29.250]  I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[05:29.570 --> 05:33.330]  What I would really appreciate is if you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[05:33.370 --> 05:36.290]  search for the grow from your heart podcast, find the review section,
[05:36.850 --> 05:38.970]  give me a five star review and type in a comment.
[05:38.970 --> 05:41.250]  Let me know what you think of the show. That would be really cool.
[05:41.250 --> 05:44.890]  What that does is moves us up in the ranks and iTunes and that exposes us to
[05:44.890 --> 05:48.930]  more listeners and then more listeners will grow better. Ganja,
[05:48.970 --> 05:51.970]  more people will help us liberate cannabis. It's a good thing.
[05:51.970 --> 05:53.850]  So give me a little review. Let me know what you think.
[05:53.850 --> 05:57.450]  I would appreciate that. I'm going to sneeze. Oh, it didn't happen.
[05:57.490 --> 05:59.610]  We talked about it and scared it away. All right.
[05:59.810 --> 06:01.890]  So we do have a real topic we want to talk about here,
[06:01.890 --> 06:03.930]  but I want to talk about one more thing since, uh,
[06:04.210 --> 06:07.490]  since Mike is a little familiar with this region of life. Uh,
[06:07.490 --> 06:12.490]  I got the privilege on Monday morning of going to jury duty at 8 a.m. on a cold
[06:14.050 --> 06:14.890]  ass Monday.
[06:14.930 --> 06:18.370]  Yep. I got lucky the last time I had to do it was during the summer.
[06:19.090 --> 06:20.410]  I mean at least I wasn't cold.
[06:20.450 --> 06:23.610]  Right? Yeah. You gotta be there bright and early and it's fucking cold and wet.
[06:23.610 --> 06:26.730]  It was so windy. It was one of the windiest days of the year. It was crazy.
[06:26.730 --> 06:29.930]  You had a jury duty on a really nasty day. Yeah.
[06:30.050 --> 06:35.050]  It was weird because the courtroom has skylight sort of windows that are kind of
[06:35.250 --> 06:40.250]  tinted behind the judge and they were changing from black to baby blue to black
[06:40.490 --> 06:43.610]  to baby blue with the weather every like 10 minutes. I was like, Holy shit,
[06:43.610 --> 06:45.530]  what's going on outside? That was crazy.
[06:46.250 --> 06:49.050]  So I had jury duty and obviously I was not selected.
[06:49.050 --> 06:51.170]  I have never selected to be a part of the jury.
[06:51.370 --> 06:54.410]  I get down to when they start asking questions and then like, Oh,
[06:54.410 --> 06:55.250]  you can go home.
[06:55.730 --> 06:56.570]  But um,
[06:57.410 --> 07:00.370]  I went in there with a certain thing in mind of what I was going to see and
[07:00.370 --> 07:02.250]  experience and how I was going to handle shit.
[07:03.050 --> 07:04.570]  And it was nothing like what I expected.
[07:05.010 --> 07:08.050]  No, it's, it's not at all like it appears on television.
[07:08.210 --> 07:09.050]  Exactly.
[07:09.690 --> 07:13.170]  And the chairs are just as uncomfortable as they appear on television,
[07:13.170 --> 07:16.730]  if not significantly more so. But other than that, very few similarities.
[07:16.730 --> 07:20.370]  It was like they were mad at us and made us sit in shitty church pews.
[07:20.570 --> 07:22.250]  It, it, it, when you're in them,
[07:22.250 --> 07:26.250]  it feels like it was designed to punish everyone that was selected significantly.
[07:26.330 --> 07:31.050]  Yes. So, uh, the thing that stood out the most to me, I'm afraid of judges,
[07:31.130 --> 07:31.850]  just straight up.
[07:31.850 --> 07:36.330]  A judge can say you are going to jail and you get to do some time in jail.
[07:36.330 --> 07:39.410]  You get to go get butt poked for a little bit and there's nothing you can do
[07:39.410 --> 07:40.250]  about it. Yep.
[07:40.730 --> 07:44.930]  The judge that resided over that courtroom was cool as fuck.
[07:45.530 --> 07:47.770]  Like I don't know the judge personally,
[07:47.890 --> 07:50.290]  but he presented himself fairly.
[07:50.610 --> 07:53.970]  I didn't feel like he was passing judgment on anybody by the way they looked.
[07:54.210 --> 07:58.970]  He treated the guys in suits and the lady in her sweatpants exactly the same.
[07:58.970 --> 08:03.250]  He was kind to everybody who was respectful and he was a human about things.
[08:03.250 --> 08:06.610]  I figured it was going to be rigorous and like the time everything would be on a
[08:06.610 --> 08:09.650]  certain time schedule and stuff. And he went for a little bit of time and he goes,
[08:09.650 --> 08:11.210]  does anybody need to use the restroom or anything?
[08:11.210 --> 08:14.530]  Can we wait another 15 minutes? And everyone's like, I can wait 15.
[08:14.530 --> 08:16.370]  And he's like, okay, we'll go in 15 minutes. You guys don't worry.
[08:16.370 --> 08:18.730]  And he looked up the clock and he was, Oh, sorry. It's been about 20 minutes.
[08:18.730 --> 08:20.690]  You guys, let's go use the restroom. We'll take 15.
[08:21.170 --> 08:22.930]  And like he was actually pretty cool. So
[08:23.410 --> 08:28.010]  you know, they're at this point for the most part it runs like it should.
[08:28.410 --> 08:32.810]  Like it's much more functional in, I don't know,
[08:32.810 --> 08:36.770]  human than a lot of people assume. I know judges like I've met many of them.
[08:36.770 --> 08:38.210]  It's right. They're people too.
[08:38.650 --> 08:40.770]  And that's what I said. Mike's a little more in that realm.
[08:40.770 --> 08:44.930]  Mike has experience in that side of life and I, uh, I'm the dreadlock. I,
[08:44.930 --> 08:48.850]  I've got dreadlocks to my ass. I got red eyes. I, I smell like cannabis.
[08:48.850 --> 08:52.730]  Most of the time I try to avoid those types of folks,
[08:52.730 --> 08:53.970]  but you know, now that things are changing,
[08:54.250 --> 08:56.850]  I'm going to have to mingle and rub some elbows with those types of people.
[08:57.290 --> 09:01.050]  But the judge was very fair. I did not feel intimidated. I didn't feel afraid.
[09:01.610 --> 09:02.450]  It was really cool.
[09:02.530 --> 09:06.490]  It may have given me a touch of faith in our system.
[09:06.730 --> 09:07.890]  Maybe a touch more.
[09:08.370 --> 09:11.050]  It's nice to know that there's at least humans involved.
[09:11.130 --> 09:15.010]  Like we're seeing it from just the juror selection part.
[09:15.050 --> 09:16.330]  They didn't kick us out.
[09:16.330 --> 09:20.730]  They didn't kick out the rejected jurors until all of the jurors had been chosen
[09:20.730 --> 09:22.970]  so that they knew that there were enough in the pool.
[09:23.410 --> 09:26.810]  And I got to watch the selection process and I got to watch all of the jurors to
[09:26.810 --> 09:31.090]  be interviewed. And then at the end of that, the two, uh, lawyers,
[09:31.090 --> 09:32.850]  the prosecutor, the prosecution,
[09:32.850 --> 09:36.490]  and the defense passed back and forth a piece of paper and they agree on which
[09:36.510 --> 09:39.410]  people are going to be the jurors. And I was laughing. I was like,
[09:39.410 --> 09:42.730]  it's like fantasy football for the lawyers or something. And they're like,
[09:42.730 --> 09:45.730]  I'll trade you the angry white guy for the passive white lady.
[09:45.730 --> 09:48.530]  And like, I can just see him negotiating. I knew who was going to go home.
[09:48.530 --> 09:51.210]  I was like, they're going to get rid of that guy. Like he's too angry.
[09:51.250 --> 09:53.810]  And he's too mad. He wants this guy to go to jail before he's even heard the
[09:53.810 --> 09:54.650]  case.
[09:55.050 --> 09:59.690]  We, the last two times I went, the first time I got let go before any of that
[09:59.690 --> 10:01.730]  started, even, I never even made it to the courtroom.
[10:02.090 --> 10:05.530]  They called all but like 20 of us and were like, the rest of you can go home.
[10:05.770 --> 10:09.530]  Like just no ceremony about it. We didn't have to sign out or nothing.
[10:09.530 --> 10:11.730]  They didn't care. The first time I went, that's what happened.
[10:11.930 --> 10:14.250]  There was a case that we were going to see that day.
[10:14.250 --> 10:17.930]  And the lady that was supposed to be in that case committed another crime and
[10:17.930 --> 10:21.250]  had been re-arrested and was going to jail and was going to be retried for all
[10:21.250 --> 10:23.890]  of her shit. So yeah, she got me out of jury duty that day,
[10:23.890 --> 10:24.970]  but she fucked up her life.
[10:25.210 --> 10:27.450]  And then the last time they, uh,
[10:28.010 --> 10:32.850]  they got down to like 30 people that they liked and they just
[10:32.850 --> 10:34.810]  waived that the rest of us want to go home.
[10:35.530 --> 10:38.210]  And so we all got to go home at lunch, which was nice. But yeah,
[10:38.210 --> 10:41.250]  that's when I got, I've had friends that have selected and served on juries and
[10:41.810 --> 10:43.130]  it's a hell of an experience.
[10:43.290 --> 10:46.810]  You know, since, uh, you guys, if you did not listen to episode number one,
[10:46.810 --> 10:48.770]  oh six, I no longer work at the spot dispensary.
[10:48.770 --> 10:50.450]  I just wanted to put that out there. I quit the spot.
[10:50.450 --> 10:52.570]  I now work at green and healthy wellness in Colorado Springs.
[10:52.570 --> 10:53.970]  Quick update. Yeah. Quick update.
[10:53.970 --> 10:57.610]  Just since one Oh six may have been unlistenable on some devices. Um, yeah,
[10:57.610 --> 10:59.850]  I quit the spot guys. I'm sorry. I had to do that. Uh,
[10:59.970 --> 11:02.010]  I work at green and healthy wellness. I'm now the grower there.
[11:02.010 --> 11:04.210]  It's in Colorado Springs. We're going to crush it. Shout out to hunt.
[11:04.610 --> 11:07.490]  But, uh, I was in jury duty and I'm sitting here thinking,
[11:07.770 --> 11:09.690]  I don't have to work tomorrow. I ain't got shit to do.
[11:10.050 --> 11:13.210]  I wouldn't mind being selected for a case. It would have been kind of fun.
[11:13.290 --> 11:16.690]  It would have been a very learning experience for myself. Yeah.
[11:17.370 --> 11:21.810]  I hate to imagine it, but now if I'm ever in court, I know how it goes. Yep.
[11:21.850 --> 11:23.050]  And I've got a little experience. It's,
[11:23.090 --> 11:25.530]  I'm not going to shit my pants the first time. Um,
[11:25.810 --> 11:27.690]  I want to invite Mike while he's sitting here in front of me,
[11:27.690 --> 11:28.890]  we'll get a commitment out of him. You guys,
[11:29.210 --> 11:31.930]  I want you to come do an episode with me about how to deal with you,
[11:31.930 --> 11:36.250]  how to conduct yourself with law enforcement, whether you're being pulled over,
[11:36.250 --> 11:38.170]  whether they're coming to your home, whether you're in public,
[11:38.170 --> 11:42.410]  whether you're at a smoking event, I'd like to get you and, uh,
[11:42.450 --> 11:43.530]  we'll get somebody else on the show too.
[11:43.530 --> 11:46.290]  I have a good idea of who we're going to get on the show. I have a good idea.
[11:46.530 --> 11:50.690]  I think we're going to get sloppy and you on the show because that's, that'll,
[11:50.730 --> 11:53.610]  that'll make for a really interesting show. That's for sure. Yes. Sloppy.
[11:53.610 --> 11:58.370]  You're invited. We have such different experiences with law enforcement.
[11:58.370 --> 12:01.770]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And I want to get both you guys on the show and we can talk
[12:01.810 --> 12:03.250]  about how to deal. Uh,
[12:03.250 --> 12:05.610]  we'll talk about how to deal with law enforcement and not get your ass thrown in
[12:05.610 --> 12:07.130]  jail. All right guys.
[12:07.130 --> 12:10.050]  So I must've blown a couple of dabs into the computer because as I was saying
[12:10.050 --> 12:12.490]  that part about the judge, it totally just quit recording here.
[12:12.490 --> 12:15.890]  Computer got too high. The computer is too dabbed out. Something went wrong. Uh,
[12:15.930 --> 12:20.170]  that means that we're going to have to start running an auxiliary output from the,
[12:20.210 --> 12:25.210]  uh, the USB down here or the mixer into the H six and dual record this bitch in
[12:25.650 --> 12:27.690]  case that happens again. And then I can just keep recording.
[12:27.690 --> 12:30.170]  The H six would have kept going. Nice. Yeah.
[12:30.170 --> 12:34.330]  Or we'll go get a little Roland handheld recorder and use the headphone out on
[12:34.330 --> 12:37.490]  the mixer and then just run that into the handheld recorder.
[12:37.530 --> 12:40.170]  And that just records onto an SD card. So there's no failure.
[12:40.290 --> 12:42.610]  The H six would work. The handheld would work.
[12:42.610 --> 12:44.170]  We'll do something like that as a backup plan.
[12:44.490 --> 12:48.890]  Or we can just take a dab when it fails and come back a couple of minutes later
[12:48.890 --> 12:51.890]  and explain that we just had a major technical failure here. Yeah.
[12:51.890 --> 12:55.010]  I like the third option. That seems simplest. It's the cheapest.
[12:55.010 --> 12:57.770]  Y'all were wondering like what kind of equipment we're doing the show with.
[12:57.770 --> 13:02.210]  Just got a pile of equipment that's larger than your car. Uh, well,
[13:02.250 --> 13:05.250]  this is the home setup. This is to where this is so that you can get the voice.
[13:05.250 --> 13:08.770]  Like there is a go cast. That's, that's what that's for. That's for all this.
[13:09.010 --> 13:12.050]  But the home base version is pretty elaborate. Y'all. Yeah. Yeah.
[13:12.050 --> 13:16.170]  The to go version is the size of a big cell phone basically. Yeah.
[13:16.170 --> 13:17.290]  When you hear me recording in the car,
[13:17.330 --> 13:20.930]  Morris's cell phone maybe. Yeah. Zach Morris's older cell phone. That's the truth.
[13:20.930 --> 13:24.490]  We just went fucking saved by the bell on this shit. All right you guys,
[13:25.090 --> 13:26.890]  the program crashed. We had to restart it.
[13:27.090 --> 13:30.330]  I just give, given a shout out and had to restart. That's the truth.
[13:30.370 --> 13:33.290]  That is the truth. I just given a shout out to the judge that resided over that
[13:33.290 --> 13:35.850]  courtroom. I felt that it was fair. I liked the way he treated people.
[13:36.250 --> 13:39.050]  I don't know how much of that got recorded, but I went to jury duty.
[13:39.050 --> 13:41.570]  You guys, it wasn't that bad. The judge was cool. It was fair.
[13:41.770 --> 13:45.690]  I wanted to move on from that and keep going while the computer is working. Um,
[13:45.890 --> 13:50.370]  that email said that they wish I'd do more grow lessons. Uh, that'll come.
[13:50.370 --> 13:51.770]  You guys, I'm, I'm working on it.
[13:51.770 --> 13:53.730]  I don't know if that got recorded in the part before.
[13:53.730 --> 13:57.010]  So we may have just double talk to that part. More girl lessons are coming.
[13:57.090 --> 13:58.490]  Yes. Um, so let's get to the,
[13:58.490 --> 14:01.930]  you may listen to ask us what you want us to talk about. That's him to talk.
[14:02.210 --> 14:04.530]  We may have said that before. Recruit the appropriate people.
[14:04.610 --> 14:05.650]  I don't know if we're double talking.
[14:05.650 --> 14:07.170]  Cause I don't know how much of that made it to the recording,
[14:07.170 --> 14:09.450]  but that's the truth. You guys are going to find out if you want more grow
[14:09.450 --> 14:11.410]  lessons, all you gotta do is let me know what you want to learn about.
[14:11.410 --> 14:14.010]  Send me an email to grow from your heart. Hotmail.com. You can tweet me.
[14:14.010 --> 14:16.730]  It's at GFYH podcast. You can find me on Facebook.
[14:16.730 --> 14:20.930]  You can send me a text message. You can, that's all one memory file.
[14:20.970 --> 14:24.930]  That was funny. Did you like how that went? Yeah. Uh, yeah, that's a lot.
[14:24.930 --> 14:26.650]  It was almost like a Tourette's spasm.
[14:28.930 --> 14:33.690]  Sorry. I didn't mean to make fun of people. That was rude. Um, so I've got, uh,
[14:33.730 --> 14:36.330]  you guys want more grow lessons and should I understand you guys would like
[14:36.330 --> 14:40.170]  the listener that sent me the email said that he would like more lessons on BHO
[14:40.170 --> 14:42.370]  and he would like a pesticide issue or episode.
[14:42.650 --> 14:45.810]  We will get our friend Sean over here as soon as I can get him back and we will
[14:45.810 --> 14:48.210]  do an organic pesticide management episode.
[14:48.570 --> 14:52.050]  And then I need to find ourselves some hash experts and we will do some hash
[14:52.170 --> 14:54.530]  episodes. I am not a hash expert. You guys, that is not me.
[14:54.810 --> 14:56.050]  Spence is a busy motherfucker.
[14:56.050 --> 14:58.610]  So getting him to come over here is going to cost me like 50 bucks an hour to
[14:58.610 --> 15:01.650]  get him to come record all the time. But we'll get a hash expert.
[15:01.650 --> 15:04.650]  We'll get him to come on the show. Let's get down to the point of the show.
[15:04.650 --> 15:07.250]  You guys have been going for 15 minutes and all we've done is talk a bunch of
[15:07.250 --> 15:11.010]  nonsense. Um, we've been covering this a little bit lately.
[15:11.010 --> 15:13.770]  I've got three news articles I'm going to read the headline to,
[15:13.850 --> 15:15.130]  and then we're going to skip all of that.
[15:15.130 --> 15:17.890]  And then we're going to go to the main article that I want to talk about.
[15:18.050 --> 15:20.690]  But this is kind of a little bit of a buildup, um, on the,
[15:20.850 --> 15:23.530]  on the website called the cannabis, which is where I find a lot of my news.
[15:23.530 --> 15:26.930]  Big shout out to David Magoya and Ricardo Baca for supplying the world with up
[15:26.930 --> 15:30.410]  to date cannabis news from Colorado. Um, I found an article.
[15:30.450 --> 15:34.850]  This one was written on November 13th and it says pesticide edict ensures fate
[15:34.890 --> 15:36.650]  of recalled Denver pot products.
[15:36.690 --> 15:41.090]  The byline is nearly 30,000 marijuana infused products recalled over pesticide
[15:41.090 --> 15:45.610]  concerns will likely be destroyed after Hickenlooper says their public safety
[15:45.610 --> 15:49.090]  risk. Uh, here's another article just to the headline.
[15:49.090 --> 15:52.090]  You guys is all I'm going to read this one. And once again was in the cannabis.
[15:52.130 --> 15:56.250]  It says Denver based lab seven 10 recalls pot products over
[15:56.250 --> 15:59.410]  pesticides. And then the byline is in the States,
[15:59.410 --> 16:01.970]  eighth pot recall in 10 months, lab seven,
[16:01.970 --> 16:06.610]  10 concentrates calls back 2,362 packages of
[16:06.610 --> 16:10.770]  marijuana concentrates. And then here is the third one that I want to read.
[16:10.770 --> 16:12.850]  The headline to it says Denver issues. Uh,
[16:12.850 --> 16:15.210]  this one was written on November 18th. Once again,
[16:15.210 --> 16:17.290]  by Ricardo Baca and David Magoya of the cannabis,
[16:17.490 --> 16:21.770]  it says Denver issues ninth pot product recall in 10 weeks.
[16:21.970 --> 16:24.010]  Then the byline is edibles company guys,
[16:24.010 --> 16:26.490]  garden issues at second voluntary recall.
[16:26.730 --> 16:31.570]  And as many weeks after banned pesticides are detected in products,
[16:32.010 --> 16:33.370]  you guys, this is an upsetting trend.
[16:33.370 --> 16:37.170]  We've been seeing here in Colorado in the commercial growing industry.
[16:37.490 --> 16:41.290]  I do not, uh, depends on your perspective. Okay.
[16:42.050 --> 16:46.570]  I, I really hate that we're finding pesticides and final product,
[16:46.570 --> 16:51.130]  but I'm so thrilled that we're finding pesticides and final product.
[16:51.130 --> 16:55.370]  Like it's this weird duality. Yes. This is regulation working.
[16:55.390 --> 16:58.890]  This is when you, you go to the store and you buy a product,
[16:58.890 --> 17:01.210]  you know, there's not pesticides in it.
[17:01.290 --> 17:03.650]  And now that cannabis is legal,
[17:03.650 --> 17:07.930]  we're a year or so from having all of that testing in place so that, you know,
[17:07.930 --> 17:12.370]  there's no bug shit. There's no pesticide. There's no mold or mildew.
[17:12.770 --> 17:14.730]  You're just getting delicious concentrate.
[17:14.730 --> 17:18.130]  So it sucks that they're finding it, but it's awesome that they're finding it.
[17:18.210 --> 17:19.610]  Right. Because now we can stop it.
[17:19.630 --> 17:24.010]  We can start teaching the growers and the grow facilities how to stop using these
[17:24.010 --> 17:27.450]  products. Uh, I, I pretty much in the future,
[17:27.450 --> 17:31.010]  I predict that the department of agriculture is going to create a pesticide
[17:31.010 --> 17:33.770]  class for the cannabis industry. They're going to have to do it. Yep.
[17:34.010 --> 17:34.850]  It's going to have to happen.
[17:34.850 --> 17:37.490]  They're going to have to make their own regulations because that's who's doing
[17:37.530 --> 17:39.450]  this. They're going to have to tell us what we can and can't do.
[17:39.450 --> 17:43.370]  They kind of are now creating all of that stuff from the ground up.
[17:43.370 --> 17:45.930]  Like it exists in every other industry,
[17:45.930 --> 17:49.770]  but we're not allowed to access any of the components that do this for like
[17:49.770 --> 17:54.770]  cantaloupe or tobacco or beer because cannabis is federally illegal.
[17:54.890 --> 17:58.250]  So we're not allowed to federally test. So now we can't find all of the labs.
[17:58.250 --> 18:02.050]  They're doing the testing were created by the demand,
[18:02.050 --> 18:03.690]  the medical industry created here.
[18:04.330 --> 18:08.090]  Like all of the labs that are up and running around the state came from the
[18:08.090 --> 18:10.970]  medical marijuana days and they weren't state mandated.
[18:10.970 --> 18:14.610]  The industry demanded them and created them on their own.
[18:14.610 --> 18:19.090]  And when the testing labs went to apply for DEA licensing, like they should,
[18:19.090 --> 18:19.930]  they all got rated.
[18:20.210 --> 18:20.730]  How did,
[18:20.730 --> 18:25.730]  so they stopped applying for DEA licensing and just ran a testing lab anyway
[18:25.850 --> 18:28.090]  would just without that federal certification,
[18:28.130 --> 18:32.170]  meaning that they can't do like organics testing or certifying or anything like
[18:32.210 --> 18:33.850]  that. Cause that's all federal, right?
[18:33.890 --> 18:35.890]  Shout out to steep hill Halen labs. Yep.
[18:35.970 --> 18:38.050]  Actually I don't think organic testing is actually federal.
[18:39.210 --> 18:42.770]  I mean regulations for using that word are, okay, that makes sense. Um,
[18:42.770 --> 18:46.530]  recently if you're a legal marijuana business and you had organics in your name,
[18:46.530 --> 18:49.090]  you had to change that. We talked about that on the show a little bit. Yep.
[18:49.130 --> 18:50.010]  Shout out three rivers.
[18:52.290 --> 18:53.930]  What you guys going to do? All right,
[18:53.930 --> 18:56.250]  so let's talk about this article a little bit. You guys. Um,
[18:56.650 --> 18:59.890]  it seems to be a trend in Colorado that a lot of the commercial grows are using
[18:59.890 --> 19:03.850]  pesticides that have been banned. And that sounds ridiculous,
[19:03.850 --> 19:08.170]  but oftentimes these products were sprayed on the plants 70 days ago and these
[19:08.170 --> 19:10.290]  rules came into effect 20 days ago.
[19:10.450 --> 19:13.810]  So you can't retroactively unspray your plants. You can't go back.
[19:13.810 --> 19:15.810]  And that's basically what we're seeing.
[19:15.850 --> 19:20.690]  Plants that were harvested six months ago and turned into other or sold off and
[19:20.690 --> 19:23.890]  turned into other products like edibles and concentrates. You know,
[19:23.890 --> 19:27.650]  I didn't put into four months ago. I didn't account for the time from,
[19:27.810 --> 19:31.170]  so you've got to grow these plant. They've got a veg, they've got to flower.
[19:31.210 --> 19:34.610]  You're looking at 90 to 120 days there. They've got to be harvested.
[19:34.610 --> 19:36.490]  They've got to be trimmed and dried and cured.
[19:36.490 --> 19:40.370]  You're looking at another two weeks there. So you're what? 140 days ish.
[19:40.570 --> 19:44.650]  Somewhere between 120 and 150 days by now. Right? That's engineer math, right?
[19:45.010 --> 19:50.010]  And then the product has to be picked up by the infusion company,
[19:50.130 --> 19:53.210]  the MIPS, whoever's going to turn it into something, the processing facility.
[19:53.490 --> 19:55.850]  I mean, then you've got drawing and carrying too. So that's right.
[19:56.290 --> 19:57.850]  That's what got us to about 150.
[19:57.890 --> 20:02.610]  But like, yeah, we're still rolling on almost 200 days, 400 or 200 days,
[20:02.610 --> 20:07.610]  250 days before it's even processed. But I mean,
[20:08.290 --> 20:13.130]  it wasn't standard practice for the company buying the product to lab test it
[20:13.130 --> 20:13.970]  again.
[20:14.450 --> 20:14.690]  Right.
[20:14.690 --> 20:18.610]  And that's one of the things that these recalls are starting to create is the
[20:18.630 --> 20:20.330]  first company to really fail.
[20:20.610 --> 20:24.530]  That was the first big policy change they announced was we're going to test
[20:24.530 --> 20:26.970]  everything that comes in now. Cause that's how this happened. Yeah.
[20:27.610 --> 20:29.810]  They process really nasty stuff.
[20:31.330 --> 20:32.850]  And we probably dabbed some of it.
[20:34.210 --> 20:37.450]  It could have happened. And you guys, a lot of people did.
[20:38.170 --> 20:41.570]  None of these recalls have been issued because people got sick or anything like
[20:41.570 --> 20:44.850]  that. It's right. Industry-wide, they're all voluntary.
[20:45.210 --> 20:47.090]  When they're going through and doing lab testing,
[20:47.090 --> 20:48.410]  when one of their products fails,
[20:48.410 --> 20:51.290]  they just do a massive recall on anything with that serial number,
[20:51.290 --> 20:54.170]  which is admirable because that's a lot of money that these guys are losing.
[20:54.410 --> 20:58.170]  Yep. That's tons of money, tons of money. I just measured money in weight,
[20:58.490 --> 21:00.530]  tons of money. Yes. Dollar amounts in weight.
[21:00.850 --> 21:04.170]  So these plants could have been sprayed 200 days ago.
[21:04.530 --> 21:08.490]  And these rules just were put into effect whenever 30 days ago, 45 days ago.
[21:08.770 --> 21:11.210]  And so it's not like people are fucking up on purpose.
[21:11.210 --> 21:12.650]  It's not like it's ignorance. It's just,
[21:13.010 --> 21:15.170]  it's just timing of laws in a lot of the places.
[21:15.770 --> 21:20.090]  Something that I want to mention is all that we'd used to smoke back in the day
[21:20.130 --> 21:23.210]  before we had dispensaries, it was being sprayed with some shit.
[21:23.490 --> 21:26.810]  There was something worse than what's happening in these dispensaries on your
[21:26.810 --> 21:28.290]  weed. You've smoked it before.
[21:28.370 --> 21:33.010]  It's quality control is one of the first things legal marijuana created as a side
[21:33.010 --> 21:35.370]  industry. And it's been a beautiful thing.
[21:35.410 --> 21:40.330]  You know, I saw quality go when medical came real popular around 2010
[21:40.890 --> 21:45.050]  quality skyrocketed. Yep. There was a huge competition for quality buds.
[21:45.370 --> 21:48.770]  And then around 2013, 2014,
[21:48.770 --> 21:51.770]  the quality started going away and the quantity started popping up.
[21:51.810 --> 21:55.290]  You know, everything looks the same. Everything looks real similar. Yep.
[21:55.450 --> 21:59.570]  I'm going to try to, uh, to make that different at green and healthy wellness.
[21:59.570 --> 22:02.730]  We've got some fun. We got, we got fire genetics and I know how to grow.
[22:02.730 --> 22:05.210]  So I'm going to try to bring that quality back to the shelf.
[22:05.290 --> 22:07.570]  Green and healthy wellness. I can't wait to see it. Yeah.
[22:07.690 --> 22:10.450]  I keep looking back at the recording software to make sure we're getting what
[22:10.450 --> 22:13.130]  we're saying because we can't afford to try to do this all over again.
[22:13.130 --> 22:14.730]  That was weird. Right. All right.
[22:14.730 --> 22:16.890]  So we're talking a lot about these tainted products.
[22:16.890 --> 22:19.890]  This brings me to an email or an email, a news article.
[22:19.890 --> 22:23.250]  I wish there was an email that would have been great. Uh, this one, um,
[22:23.250 --> 22:26.970]  Mike sent this to me from the Denver post right on Mike for finding us the good
[22:26.970 --> 22:29.450]  news. The headline is Hickenlooper issues,
[22:29.450 --> 22:33.090]  executive order to declare tainted pot a threat to the public.
[22:33.330 --> 22:37.170]  The byline is any marijuana grown with unapproved pesticides would be removed
[22:37.170 --> 22:40.410]  from commerce and destroyed. Once again,
[22:40.410 --> 22:42.730]  the articles from David McGoya and Ricardo Baca.
[22:43.290 --> 22:44.490]  And it goes a little bit like this.
[22:44.490 --> 22:47.010]  I need to take a drink cause I am dried up and then I'll read you the article.
[22:47.010 --> 22:49.610]  Mike say something impressive. Okay.
[22:50.250 --> 22:52.570]  Basically this story, um,
[22:52.650 --> 22:57.290]  just to save Jeff the effort of reading a long letter from the governor. Um,
[22:57.330 --> 23:02.330]  any marijuana grown with an unapproved pesticide is now a threat to public
[23:02.570 --> 23:06.450]  safety, just sort of by default. So any,
[23:06.450 --> 23:11.450]  but any grow that's got an unapproved pesticide use going on in their grow is
[23:12.170 --> 23:16.690]  currently scrambling to figure out new pest management protocols.
[23:17.330 --> 23:18.010]  Um,
[23:18.010 --> 23:22.330]  cause the rule in this that's going to really throw shockwaves through the
[23:22.330 --> 23:27.330]  industry is right now cannabis is federally illegal and to sell a pesticide in
[23:28.290 --> 23:32.690]  the United States, you need a federal certification and approval. Um,
[23:32.690 --> 23:37.570]  and your product has to be tested for all kinds of stuff because it's being
[23:37.570 --> 23:40.170]  sprayed on God knows what around God knows who.
[23:40.650 --> 23:45.330]  So it every pesticide comes with a lot of really specific rules about how they
[23:45.330 --> 23:48.370]  can and can't be used and what they can and can't be used on.
[23:48.930 --> 23:52.370]  And cannabis right now isn't on any of those labels.
[23:53.170 --> 23:58.050]  And what the governor just said was if cannabis isn't on the label specifically,
[23:58.050 --> 24:02.210]  you can't use it to grow marijuana legally in Colorado.
[24:02.330 --> 24:06.850]  And nobody's going to put marijuana on there or cannabis or a gun just because
[24:06.850 --> 24:07.770]  it's illegal. Yeah.
[24:08.250 --> 24:12.930]  There is a caveat. There's some, some pesticides have,
[24:13.410 --> 24:14.850]  uh, they're super safe.
[24:14.850 --> 24:18.970]  You can use them on anything and they have a standardized phrase for that.
[24:18.970 --> 24:20.010]  That'll be on the label.
[24:20.370 --> 24:25.210]  And if the pesticide carries that specific use designation,
[24:25.570 --> 24:27.170]  then it can be used on cannabis.
[24:27.170 --> 24:30.170]  So it's not like we can't use anything in this industry,
[24:30.530 --> 24:35.210]  but I guarantee there are countless grows around Colorado that have been using
[24:35.210 --> 24:40.210]  stuff that's perfectly acceptable for tobacco or flowers or food.
[24:40.810 --> 24:41.650]  Um,
[24:41.810 --> 24:46.250]  and has been used on cannabis for a decade or more around the country everywhere,
[24:46.250 --> 24:50.210]  just as common practice that are scrambling right now to figure out what they're
[24:50.210 --> 24:51.610]  going to replace that product with.
[24:52.330 --> 24:54.170]  It's going to make a huge difference for a lot of growers.
[24:54.490 --> 24:57.170]  So, uh, there's a timeline here and I will read part of the article.
[24:57.170 --> 24:59.690]  You guys might try to sum it up for us, but I'll read a bunch of it.
[24:59.850 --> 25:01.730]  There's a timeline off to the right of the article.
[25:01.970 --> 25:03.770]  That's what I was thinking about. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
[25:03.770 --> 25:06.570]  I needed a little bit of hydration, so that helped out. Um,
[25:06.610 --> 25:07.970]  there's a timeline here and it says, uh,
[25:07.970 --> 25:11.450]  on September 7th months after marijuana holds post, uh,
[25:11.490 --> 25:15.730]  post tests find pesticides in products. And that was on September 7th,
[25:16.410 --> 25:17.730]  uh, September 8th, uh,
[25:17.770 --> 25:21.210]  Denver recalls Mahatma pot extracts containing unapproved pesticides.
[25:21.250 --> 25:25.890]  And then on the 18th Denver issues two more recalls and it keeps going. Uh,
[25:26.450 --> 25:28.850]  let's see. Colorado proposes stricter rules,
[25:29.090 --> 25:33.010]  pot products made with unapproved pesticides recalled on October 18th.
[25:33.010 --> 25:37.250]  Colorado puts what that's not a real word. Uh,
[25:37.250 --> 25:40.690]  that's just abbreviated stuff on industry to use pesticides that are safe on
[25:40.690 --> 25:44.410]  pot. And then on the 21st nature's cure of Denver recalls pop products,
[25:44.410 --> 25:46.450]  containing pesticides. And it just keeps going, you guys.
[25:46.730 --> 25:49.250]  So there are a bunch of incidents of these pesticides on cannabis.
[25:49.250 --> 25:50.210]  We're going to keep seeing it.
[25:50.610 --> 25:52.850]  And then I think it'll taper off in the middle of next year.
[25:53.330 --> 25:55.970]  It should buy by summer of next year, by spring of next year,
[25:56.250 --> 25:57.530]  all this should be settled.
[25:57.530 --> 26:00.090]  Everybody should be well educated on what they can and can't use.
[26:00.090 --> 26:01.810]  All the tainted herbs should be gone.
[26:02.450 --> 26:06.210]  Some of the problem here is we don't have enough testing labs.
[26:06.690 --> 26:11.010]  So if you were looking to invest in a fun size, but side business, call us,
[26:12.330 --> 26:13.930]  we'll show you how to set up a testing lab.
[26:13.930 --> 26:16.530]  We want you to be able to test for residual solvents and hash.
[26:16.530 --> 26:18.850]  We need you to be able to test for pesticides and flowers.
[26:18.850 --> 26:22.290]  We need you to be able to test for molds and pathogens in our flowers. Uh,
[26:22.290 --> 26:25.650]  we need E. coli testing in the buds. Um, yeah, all,
[26:25.650 --> 26:30.130]  we need all the potency testing, reliable potency testing. Yep. We need it all.
[26:30.210 --> 26:32.610]  All right. Let's read part of the article. I know Mike tried to sum it up,
[26:32.610 --> 26:34.690]  but it goes like this.
[26:34.730 --> 26:38.290]  Governor John Hickenlooper on Thursday issued an executive order telling state
[26:38.290 --> 26:41.570]  agencies that any marijuana grown with unapproved pesticides is a threat to
[26:41.570 --> 26:44.730]  public safety and should be removed from commerce and destroyed.
[26:44.970 --> 26:49.290]  The order is Hickenlooper's first word on a month old controversy over pesticide
[26:49.290 --> 26:51.330]  used to grow cannabis, uh,
[26:51.370 --> 26:55.650]  and a more aggressive approach than half the dozen recalls by Denver health
[26:55.650 --> 26:58.410]  officials have put on thousands of contaminated products.
[26:58.850 --> 27:02.210]  Some of it later allowed back into commerce. Sorry, you guys,
[27:02.210 --> 27:04.250]  that was hard to read. That was a really long sentence.
[27:04.290 --> 27:07.010]  That whole paragraph is one sentence and I didn't have a good rhythm.
[27:07.090 --> 27:08.250]  Sorry I made a wonky for you.
[27:09.690 --> 27:13.210]  Damn that was a lot of technical issues where we lost our rhythm. So sorry guys.
[27:13.810 --> 27:16.010]  I don't know if it was the tech issues or the dads after,
[27:16.010 --> 27:20.010]  but it definitely fucked with my rhythm. A little from column a little from column B.
[27:20.050 --> 27:24.290]  That's the truth. The article goes on to say the order effective immediately was
[27:24.290 --> 27:27.930]  the result of a collaboration with officials from several state agencies,
[27:27.930 --> 27:29.690]  the department of agriculture, revenue,
[27:29.690 --> 27:34.530]  and public health and environment among them and provides much needed clarity on
[27:34.530 --> 27:38.250]  the use of pet use of pesticides and how agencies should treat them according to
[27:38.250 --> 27:42.650]  a joint announcement, a joint announcement, right? Uh, all right.
[27:42.810 --> 27:46.050]  It says when a pesticide is applied to a crop in a manner that is inconsistent
[27:46.050 --> 27:49.650]  with the pesticides label and the crop is contaminated by that pesticide,
[27:49.650 --> 27:53.010]  it constitutes a threat to public safety. The order says,
[27:53.330 --> 27:58.050]  the order says agencies agencies should use all investigative and enforcement
[27:58.050 --> 28:00.010]  authority to end the threat, including,
[28:00.050 --> 28:04.330]  but not limited to placing contaminated marijuana on administrative hold and
[28:04.330 --> 28:07.610]  destroying contaminated marijuana pursuant to existing law.
[28:08.050 --> 28:11.970]  Industry spokepersons spokes persons. God, my words are hard.
[28:11.970 --> 28:14.890]  Industry spokespersons could not be immediately reached for comment.
[28:14.890 --> 28:15.730]  Late Thursday,
[28:15.810 --> 28:18.890]  the order comes from Denver post stories that showed how potentially harmful
[28:18.890 --> 28:22.850]  pesticides barred for use on cannabis were still being applied and fought at
[28:22.850 --> 28:26.290]  high concentrations in products sold to customers.
[28:26.730 --> 28:30.090]  The Denver post is taking full credit for this executive order.
[28:31.490 --> 28:32.970]  That's what, yeah, that's what that sounded like.
[28:32.970 --> 28:33.810]  Thanks for pointing that out.
[28:33.810 --> 28:37.850]  Papers love it when they can say we reported something and then change happened
[28:37.850 --> 28:41.370]  at a state level because of it. And so this is a huge feather in their cap.
[28:41.770 --> 28:46.170]  They've just been buying up random product to dispensaries and taking it to
[28:46.170 --> 28:47.010]  testing labs.
[28:47.530 --> 28:49.290]  The Westward started that part of it.
[28:49.330 --> 28:53.770]  They the Westward and the Denver post both hammered the edibles industry a
[28:53.770 --> 28:57.530]  couple of years ago over potency issues.
[28:57.570 --> 29:00.570]  And then they started doing contaminants tests or the post started doing
[29:00.570 --> 29:04.730]  contaminants testing and it's definitely sent shockwaves through the industry.
[29:04.730 --> 29:06.730]  It's definitely caused change to state level.
[29:06.730 --> 29:10.490]  So they're running around like they scored cause they fucking scored.
[29:10.770 --> 29:11.610]  They kind of did.
[29:12.890 --> 29:16.290]  And it's been a good smack for the legal industry. I think like there was a little
[29:16.290 --> 29:17.130]  bit
[29:18.490 --> 29:19.770]  of shenanigans.
[29:19.770 --> 29:24.770]  Like we brought a lot of the black market stuff with us and eventually we were
[29:25.770 --> 29:29.290]  going to step up enough to where we had to play by the same rules everybody else
[29:29.290 --> 29:33.450]  did. And we've passed that point in Colorado now significantly.
[29:34.130 --> 29:38.050]  And so a lot of the things that happen at every employer are now going to be
[29:38.050 --> 29:42.850]  happening throughout the marijuana industry. And some of that's lab testing,
[29:42.850 --> 29:46.490]  some of that's recalls and it's about time it happened.
[29:46.610 --> 29:48.930]  It is, it is. All right, I'll keep going with the article.
[29:48.930 --> 29:51.330]  It says, uh, where was I? Uh,
[29:51.530 --> 29:53.090]  I wanted to give a shout out to Claude the candy man.
[29:53.090 --> 29:55.530]  We're talking about edibles, uh, shout out to Claude the candy man. Dude,
[29:55.530 --> 29:57.410]  you're on an adventure of a lifetime.
[29:57.410 --> 29:59.210]  You're probably not going to hear this podcast,
[29:59.610 --> 30:04.610]  but uh Claude is taking a personal vacation and I've seen his Facebook pictures.
[30:05.130 --> 30:07.650]  The dude has never had a bigger smile. I'm jealous.
[30:07.690 --> 30:10.690]  He's making a life change and Claude I'm proud of you bro. Big shout out, uh,
[30:10.690 --> 30:13.370]  support sweet stone candy. That's what made me think of Claude. Yeah.
[30:13.410 --> 30:14.490]  He needs a shout out on the show.
[30:15.010 --> 30:18.610]  So it goes on to say the post also identified how state laws that barred the use
[30:18.610 --> 30:21.610]  of certain pesticides were not enforced and that testing requirements for
[30:21.610 --> 30:26.370]  pesticide residues were set aside. And then it says a threat to safety.
[30:26.770 --> 30:26.930]  Uh,
[30:26.930 --> 30:30.730]  Thursday's bulletin specifically mandates state agencies to determine any off
[30:30.730 --> 30:32.490]  label use of the pesticides,
[30:32.490 --> 30:36.170]  a threat to public safety and ensure that the contaminated products are
[30:36.170 --> 30:40.530]  quarantined and destroyed. Oh, that's a bunch of hash and pot.
[30:40.530 --> 30:42.490]  You just got to watch get just destroyed.
[30:42.690 --> 30:45.650]  I'm wondering how high the animals, the landfill, you're gonna end up.
[30:46.650 --> 30:48.490]  Are they just going to burn it? Like back in the day,
[30:48.730 --> 30:51.490]  but the fire department used to just put all the bales of weed in the fire.
[30:51.490 --> 30:54.890]  They still do that all over the place and every now and then they fuck it up and
[30:54.890 --> 30:59.050]  get the whole town really high. Yeah. But I, I don't know, maybe,
[30:59.090 --> 31:02.770]  I think it's just going to get blended with dirt is what it's probably going to
[31:02.770 --> 31:05.530]  happen with it. That's kind of what happens at a dispensary. Uh,
[31:05.650 --> 31:09.370]  if you run a soil grow and you've got to throw leaves away, you do like lasagna,
[31:09.370 --> 31:13.170]  you do leaves, dirt, leaves, dirt, just smash it up. Yep. All right.
[31:13.210 --> 31:15.890]  The article goes on to say Thursday's bulletin specifically meant no way.
[31:15.890 --> 31:17.810]  I just read that part. Uh, that is, uh,
[31:17.970 --> 31:20.810]  that is a stiffer approach than the quantum quarantines and recalls.
[31:20.810 --> 31:23.530]  Denver health officials have put on marijuana products contaminated with
[31:23.530 --> 31:27.330]  unapproved pesticides. In most cases, the products were allowed back into commerce.
[31:27.330 --> 31:31.210]  Once test confirmed pesticide residues were at levels lower than what's allowed
[31:31.490 --> 31:33.010]  on other consumable crops.
[31:33.530 --> 31:37.570]  Hickenlooper's order appears to leave no room for trace amounts and recalls for
[31:37.570 --> 31:41.090]  the destruction of the affected plants and any derivative products.
[31:41.690 --> 31:44.090]  Zero, no trace elements.
[31:44.090 --> 31:48.130]  So if they used any pesticide and they find it on there pretty much bye-bye to
[31:48.130 --> 31:49.450]  your whole product line.
[31:49.890 --> 31:53.450]  Yep. If they use some of this stuff, I mean, in years ago,
[31:53.530 --> 31:57.890]  they could be destroying breeding stock or I, how many,
[31:58.450 --> 32:03.330]  this is most of the recalls are stemmed from a couple of bigger grows that
[32:03.370 --> 32:05.010]  wholesale off, um,
[32:05.010 --> 32:09.850]  dried flour to other companies to make edibles or hash with. And so that's,
[32:09.970 --> 32:14.210]  it's the people that bought it that are now issuing recalls is they go through
[32:14.210 --> 32:15.210]  and they're like, wait, fuck.
[32:15.210 --> 32:18.850]  We bought 80 pounds of that and we make chocolate bars.
[32:18.850 --> 32:22.930]  So we threw that 80 pounds in with a thousand other pounds we bought and we made
[32:22.930 --> 32:25.090]  butter out of that. And then we made edibles.
[32:25.610 --> 32:29.290]  And now we've got to recall all the edible batches with those serial numbers on
[32:29.290 --> 32:31.890]  it. Like it's huge ripples through the industry.
[32:32.530 --> 32:34.570]  You were going to see lab testing at every level.
[32:34.570 --> 32:38.730]  We're going to see the labs triple or quadruple the number across the state to
[32:38.730 --> 32:41.290]  handle all the testing that's going to have to take place.
[32:42.410 --> 32:47.370]  I wouldn't be surprised to see a little spike in price of a buck or
[32:47.370 --> 32:52.010]  two per whatever to help cover all this fucking costs because yeah,
[32:52.010 --> 32:54.170]  it's going to play into it. But at the same time,
[32:55.410 --> 32:59.490]  I'm happy to buy stuff in the legal industry cause I know that it's clean.
[32:59.490 --> 33:00.970]  Stuff's coming out. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:01.010 --> 33:03.810]  I don't have to worry about what's being sprayed on it or what's still in it.
[33:04.370 --> 33:08.450]  Man, you just made the greatest argument for legal prostitution. Yep. Yep.
[33:08.770 --> 33:12.370]  That applies. Yeah. I didn't just study legalizing weed in college.
[33:13.450 --> 33:15.730]  We studied legalizing other stuff too. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:16.050 --> 33:17.690]  If the hookers are tested and clean,
[33:17.730 --> 33:20.370]  then it's better than getting some dirty hookers. All right.
[33:20.570 --> 33:23.090]  We've gotten sidetracked. I'm going to continue with the article here.
[33:23.810 --> 33:27.290]  It goes on to say a company could destroy any affected marijuana voluntarily or
[33:27.290 --> 33:30.890]  face administrative actions by the state to force the destruction according to a
[33:30.890 --> 33:35.130]  policy statement issued by the chiefs of the three state agencies involved.
[33:35.450 --> 33:39.130]  There is no pesticide specifically approved for use on marijuana because the
[33:39.130 --> 33:42.970]  chemicals are regulated by the U S environmental protection agency and cannabis
[33:42.970 --> 33:45.930]  is illegal under federal law. As a result,
[33:45.930 --> 33:49.130]  there have been no tests to show how pesticides used on marijuana could affect
[33:49.130 --> 33:51.690]  consumers or whether their use is safe.
[33:52.490 --> 33:56.850]  But state agricultural officials have allowed certain pesticides to be used on
[33:56.850 --> 34:00.330]  marijuana crops only if it would not violate the restriction on the products
[34:00.330 --> 34:01.130]  label.
[34:01.130 --> 34:04.810]  That is a violation of federal law to use a pesticide contrary to its label.
[34:05.130 --> 34:06.690]  You guys, this applies to you and your home grow.
[34:06.690 --> 34:09.770]  This applies to you and your greenhouse grow. Uh, any pesticide,
[34:10.250 --> 34:13.530]  wants to be a dick. It can be an extra charge. Yep. Yep.
[34:13.570 --> 34:16.370]  All you got to do when you buy your, your spray products, your, uh,
[34:16.530 --> 34:19.570]  pesticides peel off that little booklet that's on the back and read it.
[34:19.810 --> 34:21.650]  There will be rules on there. Um,
[34:21.690 --> 34:25.970]  there will be what you should really pay attention to is the interval of re
[34:25.970 --> 34:29.850]  entry. Uh, if it says not to go in the sprayed area for four hours,
[34:29.850 --> 34:32.010]  you should probably stay out of there for four hours. Take,
[34:32.050 --> 34:33.090]  take that seriously.
[34:33.370 --> 34:35.770]  You're not going to notice that you're getting sick from a pesticide until you
[34:35.770 --> 34:40.010]  start twitching in five years. Right? Like you really want to read those labels.
[34:40.050 --> 34:44.290]  Yeah. So, uh, where the heck was I? Uh, despite the prohibitions,
[34:44.290 --> 34:48.050]  the post revealed in its own testing that a number of marijuana infused products
[34:48.050 --> 34:52.050]  contained high levels of pesticides, not allowed for use on cannabis.
[34:52.490 --> 34:55.370]  What followed were a number of recalls issued by the Denver department of
[34:55.570 --> 34:59.450]  environmental health after investigations into businesses connected with the
[34:59.850 --> 35:02.810]  post findings. We're at the last paragraph, you guys go ahead, Mike.
[35:02.810 --> 35:03.450]  You had something to say.
[35:03.450 --> 35:07.570]  Downplay the other half of their findings. They found, they tested eight samples.
[35:07.570 --> 35:09.330]  Two of them came back pretty dirty,
[35:09.810 --> 35:14.810]  but the other six came back cleaner than the lab testing dude had seen
[35:14.810 --> 35:19.810]  anything in a while. Nice. So, but that's not news. Well, it should be.
[35:19.930 --> 35:23.250]  It should be, but I mean, there's no scare tactic involved in that, right?
[35:23.250 --> 35:27.650]  Like it's, it's really unfortunate that the there's dirty product out on store
[35:27.650 --> 35:31.170]  shelves, but at the same time it's all being recalled because we've got testing
[35:31.170 --> 35:35.010]  labs. No one else has. Like, it's kind of a beautiful thing.
[35:35.010 --> 35:36.490]  And it's such a fucked up way though.
[35:38.170 --> 35:40.370]  All right, you guys, I will try. I'm going to make myself a note,
[35:40.530 --> 35:44.610]  a list of approved. All right.
[35:44.610 --> 35:47.530]  I want to find a list of approved pesticides, which I need anyway for the shop.
[35:48.050 --> 35:50.410]  Uh, we just, we use basically one or two products at the shop.
[35:50.410 --> 35:52.770]  We've got a pretty good pesticide regiment going on there,
[35:53.170 --> 35:55.450]  but I will get a list of approved pesticides.
[35:55.450 --> 35:57.010]  We'll talk about that on the show. Uh,
[35:57.010 --> 36:01.210]  when we do the pest management episode that I need to work on,
[36:01.610 --> 36:03.650]  I've got a lot of episodes that are like halfway written. You guys,
[36:03.650 --> 36:07.010]  I just need to put them together. Things have been really chaotic in my world.
[36:07.250 --> 36:10.570]  Um, I've been driving to Springs like three times a week to talk about getting a
[36:10.570 --> 36:12.930]  job and now I've got the job. So it's going to be a lot of fun.
[36:13.250 --> 36:17.050]  Let's get onto the last paragraph of this news article so that we can get Mike
[36:17.050 --> 36:19.330]  home to his little baby. It says,
[36:19.330 --> 36:22.530]  although state officials had been battling around pesticide rules for more than a
[36:22.530 --> 36:25.770]  year, there was no enforcement until Denver health officials quarantined more
[36:25.770 --> 36:27.650]  than a hundred thousand plants.
[36:27.650 --> 36:32.370]  It said were improperly grown with pesticides the state said could not be used.
[36:32.810 --> 36:36.050]  The quarantines came after Denver fire inspectors found potentially hazardous
[36:36.050 --> 36:39.570]  pesticides and marijuana growing facilities during routine inspections this
[36:39.570 --> 36:43.290]  year and reported it to health officials. You guys, I mentioned this on the show.
[36:43.690 --> 36:48.090]  Uh, they found a, uh, Eagle 20 in there. And when Eagle 20 is it Eagle 20 or
[36:48.090 --> 36:52.250]  floor might it's Eagle 20. When Eagle 20 catches on fire and burns the off gas,
[36:52.290 --> 36:54.370]  that comes from Eagle 20 is cyanide.
[36:54.610 --> 36:58.690]  So that's why the fire fire department doesn't want that in your grow because
[36:58.690 --> 36:59.850]  when it catches on fire,
[36:59.850 --> 37:02.930]  they really read the fucking label people. Yeah.
[37:03.010 --> 37:06.370]  Like know what you've got in your grow. Know what you've got in your house.
[37:06.610 --> 37:08.530]  This is all going into your lungs. Yeah.
[37:08.570 --> 37:11.650]  You should read the label on any product you're using anyway, all the time.
[37:11.650 --> 37:14.290]  You should kind of be aware of what you're putting into yourself and your plants
[37:14.290 --> 37:19.130]  and your food, feeding your dog, read the label. All right. Last paragraph,
[37:19.130 --> 37:21.890]  you guys last small sentence in the paragraph,
[37:22.130 --> 37:25.410]  the state is amid rulemaking that would strictly limit the pesticides that can
[37:25.410 --> 37:30.090]  be used on marijuana only to those whose labels allow for unspecified crops that
[37:30.090 --> 37:33.690]  can be used in greenhouses and that are not prohibited from human consumption.
[37:34.130 --> 37:39.130]  Pesticides allowed in tobacco cultivation also would be approved.
[37:39.570 --> 37:39.930]  All right.
[37:39.930 --> 37:44.930]  So any pesticides found in any tested cannabis equals your cannabis is now being
[37:45.410 --> 37:48.690]  destroyed. Yep. That's a huge move. That's,
[37:49.010 --> 37:51.490]  Mike said it a minute ago. It's going to make prices go up.
[37:52.210 --> 37:54.850]  I mean, it's going to send big ripples through the industry.
[37:54.890 --> 37:59.650]  There's not everybody was growing with the stuff that's being banned or was
[37:59.650 --> 38:00.930]  banned a couple of months back.
[38:01.330 --> 38:04.290]  So it's not like everyone has to change up,
[38:04.330 --> 38:09.090]  but every company that buys product does like it's,
[38:09.090 --> 38:12.810]  it's only a matter of time before shops are lab testing.
[38:12.810 --> 38:16.570]  Everything that comes in just as a matter of policy,
[38:17.530 --> 38:19.890]  let alone extract companies, edible companies.
[38:19.890 --> 38:22.330]  Just think of a product like Chibu Chu or Dixie.
[38:22.330 --> 38:25.770]  Let's get into the new Snoop dog and how much stuff they buy and process,
[38:25.770 --> 38:28.130]  right? Or Snoop's new line or Rihanna's new line.
[38:28.130 --> 38:30.610]  I like there's fucking every on his new line. Yep.
[38:30.810 --> 38:33.330]  What did I buy? It had just been a meme on Facebook. I don't know.
[38:33.330 --> 38:36.850]  I'm high and I scroll through a lot of news. Yeah. Um, but Willie's no,
[38:37.010 --> 38:39.570]  Willie's got a brand coming out. Like, uh, just came out.
[38:39.610 --> 38:42.090]  If you're mildly famous for marijuana,
[38:42.090 --> 38:45.050]  you've got a bro fucking brand of marijuana coming out.
[38:46.050 --> 38:50.130]  Well, since we're on the topic, you know what I was going to say is I want to
[38:50.130 --> 38:53.570]  see since Snoop and I'm not dissing you Snoop Snoop dog. I fucking love you,
[38:53.570 --> 38:57.530]  bro. Snoop dog. I'm from California, bro. I grew up. I, my cousin lived in Long Beach.
[38:57.530 --> 38:59.970]  I spent a lot of time in the LBC. Uh,
[39:00.090 --> 39:03.610]  Snoop dog actually went to school with my cousin. I think it's like my second.
[39:03.610 --> 39:07.410]  Anyway, Snoop dog listening. I'm not dissing Snoop dog. He might be.
[39:07.490 --> 39:09.810]  How do you know Snoop ain't smokingking a blunt listening to the growth from your
[39:09.810 --> 39:12.290]  heart? I listened to the GGN. He should listen to the growth from your heart.
[39:12.410 --> 39:15.850]  I'm reciprocity is nice, but yeah. But Snoop bro,
[39:16.290 --> 39:18.730]  you signed up with the shittiest fucking dispensary in Colorado.
[39:18.930 --> 39:24.090]  Like they are known to be the shittiest, the most low quality. Yeah.
[39:24.130 --> 39:26.890]  Yeah. They're a, they're that fucking dispensary.
[39:26.890 --> 39:31.890]  They got or is accused of handing out fucking edibles at the goddamn state fair.
[39:31.970 --> 39:34.650]  They just keep fucking up left and right. So, uh,
[39:34.690 --> 39:36.890]  and they also had a lot of pesticide issues in the past.
[39:37.050 --> 39:40.650]  So I'm curious to see if Snoop's products have residual pesticides from when they
[39:40.690 --> 39:44.330]  were made back in the day. Who knows? Yeah. Yeah. Who do knows?
[39:46.330 --> 39:48.450]  Wow. Yeah, I said it. You did that.
[39:49.090 --> 39:51.650]  And since we're talking about like celebrities and things that are going to have
[39:51.650 --> 39:55.850]  strains coming out, let's go ahead and toot some IRI genetics horns here. Uh,
[39:56.730 --> 40:01.730]  over the past two nights I have been harvesting the lovely damsels.
[40:02.450 --> 40:04.170]  Dank. It actually got harvested a few nights ago.
[40:04.170 --> 40:07.250]  It was finally dry enough to finish do the final trim.
[40:07.450 --> 40:12.450]  So damsels dank you guys is jarred up and the curing process has begun.
[40:12.810 --> 40:16.330]  There will be a tasting party, uh, the first weekend of December.
[40:16.690 --> 40:18.930]  It's a private party. I would invite you, but, uh,
[40:19.290 --> 40:23.010]  I can't have all you guys showing up. Uh, so it's taken. Yeah.
[40:23.170 --> 40:26.210]  All the seats are full you guys. Uh, but I will let you know how it goes.
[40:26.210 --> 40:29.930]  I'll try to get damsel on the show shortly after that so that she can talk about
[40:29.930 --> 40:33.730]  her new strain that I made for, um, I hope she likes it.
[40:33.730 --> 40:38.250]  I can't wait till this process is over so I can finally get some details
[40:38.250 --> 40:42.370]  because all I've seen is three jar samples flash in front of my nose.
[40:42.370 --> 40:43.210]  Really good night.
[40:43.890 --> 40:47.170]  Yeah. But Instagram pictures and some jar samples is pretty much what I've,
[40:47.210 --> 40:48.130]  what I've shown anybody.
[40:48.170 --> 40:51.450]  Right. And I want to dig through all of those jars and there's a whole bunch of
[40:51.450 --> 40:52.050]  them over there.
[40:52.050 --> 40:56.050]  There are 10 that made it to the final round for damsel to choose from.
[40:56.050 --> 41:00.090]  So whichever one of those 10 she likes the best we will work with. Um,
[41:00.370 --> 41:03.690]  she's human and she may reject all 10 of them. That may not be what she wants.
[41:03.850 --> 41:07.450]  So this might just be round one. Yeah, exactly. And if that's the case,
[41:07.450 --> 41:10.770]  then I just did a really cool Fino hunt and I found at least three keepers had a
[41:10.770 --> 41:13.970]  head shit, right? Like there's some stank and there's some dank over there.
[41:13.970 --> 41:17.690]  You never end up bussed after a good Fino. That's the truth. Fino hunt.
[41:17.690 --> 41:19.930]  You guys listen to the episode I did about Fino hunting.
[41:19.970 --> 41:22.610]  I don't remember which number it is, but make sure you check out the website.
[41:22.610 --> 41:26.810]  Look it up. There you go. It's super easy to do. Yup. Go to iTunes, go to grow.
[41:26.810 --> 41:30.090]  I read genetics, colorado.com. Look for the grow from your heart podcast tab.
[41:30.290 --> 41:33.690]  Scroll through every episode is there. You'll find it. You guys. Um,
[41:33.690 --> 41:35.570]  so we've covered the Hickenlooper article.
[41:35.570 --> 41:37.970]  You got anything else you want to say while we're on the air, bro?
[41:39.450 --> 41:42.050]  Not especially. You just like shout out to everybody.
[41:42.050 --> 41:46.250]  There's a lot of changes with people in my life this week. Like you change jobs,
[41:46.250 --> 41:47.450]  but you're not alone there.
[41:48.010 --> 41:50.850]  I've talked to a whole bunch of people that are going through big change right
[41:50.870 --> 41:53.890]  now. So shout out for people trying to do something to make them.
[41:53.970 --> 41:56.370]  That's going to make them happy. Yeah, that's the truth. Uh,
[41:56.410 --> 41:57.970]  don't be afraid of a little bit of success.
[41:57.970 --> 42:00.770]  That's what I said on episode number one Oh six that nobody got to listen to
[42:00.770 --> 42:04.290]  because Stitcher failed us. I apologize. Um, yeah.
[42:04.290 --> 42:06.370]  So let's start wrapping up to show you the,
[42:06.370 --> 42:09.530]  it's been 40 something minutes minus whatever I have to edit out because of a
[42:09.530 --> 42:13.450]  little tech issue in the middle. Email us specific grow questions. Yes.

[42:46.530 --> 42:48.090]  There were like four people who,
[42:48.090 --> 42:52.650]  who hashtag this appropriately within the timeline. So if you,
[42:52.650 --> 42:55.290]  we'll get them taken care of. If you count how many people there are,
[42:55.370 --> 42:58.930]  we'll put envelopes on the table and then we'll email them or they need to send
[42:58.950 --> 43:01.250]  us their addresses so that we can mail them stickers.
[43:01.370 --> 43:04.810]  Yeah. If you're listening again tonight, you know who you are. Direct message me
[43:04.810 --> 43:09.810]  or, uh, um, at Nemo punk 15 or, or you can grow from your heart.
[43:10.850 --> 43:13.010]  I'd send it to at Rasta Jeff for 20. Yep.
[43:13.050 --> 43:17.330]  Just direct message that in Twitter or over Facebook or whatever.
[43:17.330 --> 43:19.050]  And we'll get you your sticker back mailed up. Yeah.
[43:19.050 --> 43:21.610]  We'll get your stickers to you. We did not. You guys are awesome. I got,
[43:21.850 --> 43:24.810]  I got such a big grin every time one of those came through.
[43:24.810 --> 43:28.530]  It was a good hour of just smiling. Hashtag. I like it when you ramble.
[43:29.050 --> 43:33.130]  So you guys do let's, uh, let's put an end to that now so that people can't jump
[43:33.130 --> 43:35.970]  on. No mass. No mass. That is over you guys. Um,
[43:36.290 --> 43:40.850]  once this drop in this will come out Monday, which will be, um,
[43:40.930 --> 43:44.850]  the 23rd ish Monday, the something, something. Yeah.
[43:44.970 --> 43:49.050]  The Monday. Come on calendar. You gotta go faster. 23rd. I was correct.
[43:49.250 --> 43:53.810]  So Monday the 23rd, the hashtag, I like it when you ramble sticker pack,
[43:54.010 --> 43:58.330]  sweepstakes, sweepstakes that has expired. You guys, that is no longer offer.
[43:58.930 --> 44:01.970]  Um, but if you really want some stickers, send me a tweet, uh,
[44:02.210 --> 44:03.850]  send the tweet to, uh,
[44:03.850 --> 44:06.570]  I'm giving you so many different Twitter addresses to talk about now.
[44:07.130 --> 44:10.570]  Send the tweet to at GFYH podcast, follow the podcast.
[44:10.570 --> 44:12.930]  We'll figure out how to get you some stickers one way or another.
[44:13.450 --> 44:16.410]  You may make you do something for him, but it won't be anything real crazy.
[44:16.610 --> 44:19.690]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for him. Something like that. Yeah.
[44:19.810 --> 44:22.690]  I'll probably make you follow me on Instagram and all seven of my Twitter
[44:22.730 --> 44:25.370]  accounts or something like that. I don't really have seven Twitters.
[44:25.370 --> 44:28.490]  That's an exaggeration, but sometimes it feels like I do. All right.
[44:28.770 --> 44:32.730]  We're just rambling hashtag. I like it when you ramble. Uh, speaking of being,
[44:33.210 --> 44:37.050]  that one's going to stick around November 19th. Tomorrow is my mom's birthday.
[44:37.410 --> 44:40.130]  My mom does not listen to the podcast. My mom doesn't grow weed,
[44:40.130 --> 44:43.490]  but happy birthday, mom. You got to send her love either way. Um,
[44:43.570 --> 44:45.810]  I guess that's a good way to wrap up the show, right? Yeah.
[44:45.850 --> 44:47.650]  You guys make sure you follow us on all the social media.
[44:47.650 --> 44:50.330]  I'm sure you've caught all the, uh, the names and places by now.
[44:50.330 --> 44:54.330]  Make sure you follow Mike it's at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter, search him out,
[44:54.370 --> 44:57.370]  follow him. Do you want to advertise your Facebook group while we're here?
[44:57.730 --> 45:01.010]  Yeah, I might as well. I haven't mentioned it until now, but fuck it. Uh,
[45:01.050 --> 45:05.130]  follow me on Facebook. If you'd like, it's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[45:05.170 --> 45:08.370]  Just punch that into your search. I'll come right up. Um,
[45:08.690 --> 45:12.250]  I've been getting a lot of feedback on that lately.
[45:12.250 --> 45:14.450]  Shit's been blowing up lately because, uh,
[45:15.050 --> 45:19.010]  anti-pop people have taken notice and are starting to get really pissed when I
[45:19.050 --> 45:21.650]  link their stuff and debunk it. Um,
[45:21.930 --> 45:26.410]  and it's led to some really hilarious little prohibitionists. I don't know,
[45:26.850 --> 45:30.130]  attempted trolling, I suppose, is a good way to describe it. It's,
[45:30.130 --> 45:35.130]  it's funny cause it's sort of like if a small child decided to lecture calculus
[45:35.250 --> 45:38.610]  at you, like it doesn't matter how passionate they are.
[45:38.610 --> 45:40.170]  Like they're never going to get it right.
[45:40.930 --> 45:44.370]  You're not going to learn anything useful. Um,
[45:44.410 --> 45:48.210]  it's just this weird thing that I mean, to be against pot at this point in
[45:48.250 --> 45:51.570]  history is to have failed to do your homework.
[45:52.250 --> 45:57.170]  And that's just where the argument starts. Yeah. Poor Randy. Oh, poor Randy.
[45:57.210 --> 46:01.450]  Poor Randy. Randy, I slayed you so much. So much passion.
[46:01.450 --> 46:03.890]  So little information. You're a poor little troll, Randy.
[46:03.890 --> 46:06.850]  And I done slayed you so many times and you just keep coming back for more.
[46:07.010 --> 46:09.890]  I need someone who likes to make memes. I don't have time to do this shit.
[46:09.890 --> 46:12.730]  I'll do it. I need somebody to help me reply.
[46:13.170 --> 46:16.690]  We have got trolls on this podcast that listen religiously.
[46:16.690 --> 46:17.770]  So if you need a meme,
[46:17.770 --> 46:22.490]  you call them to action and we will get you some memes. Right. Yeah. Um,
[46:22.570 --> 46:27.490]  yeah. The anti-pot community learned a meme like a week ago and it's stuff that
[46:27.490 --> 46:29.010]  makes you want to put your head through a wall.
[46:29.810 --> 46:33.050]  All right. You guys are going to have to like,
[46:33.050 --> 46:35.250]  so that you can help them with the meme more. Yep.
[46:35.290 --> 46:38.930]  I just don't have the energy all the time to fucking debunk nonsense.
[46:38.930 --> 46:42.370]  Cause there's a lot of nonsense. This is, we're way off topic you guys,
[46:42.370 --> 46:45.130]  but I hashtag, I like it when you ramble and I hope you guys are listening.
[46:45.650 --> 46:46.570]  Shout out if you are.
[46:46.810 --> 46:50.610]  We're a rambling Facebook has murdered me over the past week with all of the
[46:50.810 --> 46:54.690]  change your profile picture to a French flag and all of this.
[46:54.690 --> 46:57.450]  And everybody talking about who's a terrorist and who is not.
[46:57.650 --> 47:01.970]  That has burnt me the shit out. I can't even look at Facebook the past week.
[47:02.530 --> 47:06.970]  I find myself shunning news and social media after events like this,
[47:06.970 --> 47:10.730]  just because of all that, like the event itself is bad enough.
[47:10.770 --> 47:14.370]  All the hate and the fear and the idiocy and the ignorance that led up to it's
[47:14.370 --> 47:18.250]  bad enough. But then the shit that comes after is just so much worse. Right?
[47:18.450 --> 47:21.490]  Yeah. Yeah. Facebook just makes me want to smash my head into the wall lately.
[47:21.530 --> 47:22.650]  So I've been avoiding that.
[47:22.650 --> 47:25.290]  Sorry if I haven't been returning your Facebook messages and all that stuff for
[47:25.290 --> 47:28.330]  the past week, you guys. But once all this stuff stops on Facebook,
[47:28.530 --> 47:31.610]  once we go back to talking about football games and stupid shit, I'll be back.
[47:32.370 --> 47:34.770]  Yep. It's a little too intense right now.
[47:35.050 --> 47:37.690]  I have to go unfriend people because of some of the shit that I see.
[47:37.970 --> 47:39.650]  I'm not going to tolerate some of it.
[47:39.850 --> 47:42.450]  Like I'm not going to get all political and get my opinion going too much on
[47:42.450 --> 47:46.210]  there. This is weed podcast, but God damn, some people get really,
[47:46.210 --> 47:47.970]  really ridiculous, really, really quickly.
[47:48.130 --> 47:51.770]  When people are afraid, they do really, really crazy, insane things.
[47:51.770 --> 47:53.930]  And that's what's going on right now is,
[47:54.010 --> 47:57.170]  is there's a lot of fear out there and people are just diving into it because
[47:57.170 --> 47:57.770]  it's easy.
[47:57.770 --> 48:01.850]  There is a lot of fear. You guys don't buy into the fear. Find the truth. Yep.
[48:01.890 --> 48:03.530]  I know that's hard to do in the, in the world right now.
[48:03.530 --> 48:05.490]  There are a lot of clouds plus the ones we're blowing,
[48:05.530 --> 48:07.410]  but you got to try to find the truth. Search for the truth.
[48:07.850 --> 48:09.250]  The truth will set you free.
[48:09.690 --> 48:11.690]  Yeah. All right. And calm the fuck down.
[48:12.490 --> 48:14.930]  Take some tabs and calm the fuck down. Like God,
[48:14.930 --> 48:17.530]  that's how I feel that way about half of the people that I see. I'm like,
[48:17.530 --> 48:19.330]  you need a dab and a fucking chill pill.
[48:19.330 --> 48:23.330]  Been the main thought going through my head the last two weeks is just like,
[48:23.330 --> 48:26.930]  dude, calm the fuck down. Yeah. Like you need two dabs and a nappy nap.
[48:26.970 --> 48:28.490]  Like that's what your life needs.
[48:29.010 --> 48:31.690]  Hey Bernie, if you're listening to the podcast, bro, we're still friends.
[48:31.690 --> 48:34.770]  A nappy nap. Bernie, you need a dab and a nap, but we're still friends, bro.
[48:35.010 --> 48:35.850]  Even though we had a heated conversation.
[48:35.850 --> 48:38.690]  That's so funny. I gave him a dab and a nap the other day and it worked out pretty
[48:38.690 --> 48:39.530]  well.
[48:40.410 --> 48:44.450]  No, I just, I gave him a couple of dabs and sent him home and he replied or sent
[48:44.450 --> 48:46.570]  me a message like 12 hours later. That was like, got super high.
[48:46.570 --> 48:47.410]  I went home and went to sleep.
[48:47.490 --> 48:50.290]  Do you drive him around in your kid's new car seat? Nope.
[48:52.610 --> 48:55.450]  Sorry, Bernie. I had to bro. Uh, if you guys didn't catch on,
[48:55.450 --> 48:57.290]  Bernie's about three foot two, I think.
[48:58.970 --> 49:01.050]  No, he's like five foot. He's a great guy.
[49:01.050 --> 49:03.490]  That's why I don't feel bad picking on him because he's actually a good dude.
[49:03.690 --> 49:05.610]  And that's why I'm giving him a shout out and saying,
[49:05.610 --> 49:09.010]  even though we had a heated conversation on Facebook and we totally disagree on
[49:09.050 --> 49:11.570]  some shit, I agree that we disagree and you're still my bro.
[49:12.010 --> 49:16.930]  Yeah. We just can't. He's a politics. He's a Marine. And so, uh,
[49:16.970 --> 49:21.090]  he's done shit. And a combat vet. Yeah. Thank you. Uh,
[49:21.210 --> 49:23.530]  thank you. And all the combat vets. Cause if,
[49:23.730 --> 49:26.850]  if we didn't have vets that signed up to go do shit or people that signed up to
[49:26.850 --> 49:30.370]  be Marines and army guys and air force guys, uh,
[49:30.370 --> 49:32.530]  you and I would get drafted bro because we're big.
[49:32.850 --> 49:34.570]  I hope you're so bad at the army.
[49:34.570 --> 49:37.650]  I've thought about that a lot.
[49:37.650 --> 49:40.170]  Like even when I was a teenager and I had friends that were like,
[49:40.170 --> 49:42.050]  I think I'm going to go sign up for the air force. I was like,
[49:42.290 --> 49:45.250]  I would die twice. Like that's so not me, bro.
[49:45.250 --> 49:48.090]  You've played black ops with me. You want to be in the military with me? Nope.
[49:48.410 --> 49:50.770]  If I throw, if I get flash banged 90% of the time,
[49:50.770 --> 49:55.050]  it's cause I threw the flashbang tight pants, lots of running. That's so not me.
[49:55.090 --> 49:59.250]  It doesn't sound the desert, the desert. Nope. Not me. I don't look good in camo.
[49:59.410 --> 50:02.210]  Weapons are loud. No, I'd miss everybody on purpose, bro.
[50:02.370 --> 50:03.290]  You'd be like, they're the terrorists.
[50:03.290 --> 50:07.030]  And I'd be like just kind of fake aiming at them to shoot next to him to scare
[50:07.030 --> 50:10.570]  him away. You hear the sirens just now that was crazy.
[50:10.610 --> 50:13.730]  It came through my headphones. All right, you guys, we are totally rambly.
[50:13.730 --> 50:16.030]  We're totally off topic. I said, happy birthday to my mom.
[50:16.030 --> 50:18.450]  That was the last note that I had. We're going to start wrapping up the show.
[50:18.450 --> 50:21.290]  I want to thank everybody for listening. Mike, dude, thanks for coming. Hey Jen,
[50:21.290 --> 50:22.090]  if you listen to the show,
[50:22.130 --> 50:24.050]  thanks for letting me borrow your husband for an hour or two.
[50:24.070 --> 50:25.570]  Sorry I sent him home high as fuck,
[50:27.810 --> 50:29.830]  but I appreciate you letting them come over and spend some time with me and
[50:29.830 --> 50:30.630]  record a podcast.
[50:30.630 --> 50:32.650]  So listeners really appreciate him on here.
[50:32.650 --> 50:33.830]  Hey Davey, if you're listening bro,
[50:33.830 --> 50:35.830]  I hope you're feeling better.
[50:35.830 --> 50:36.670]  Give him a little.
[50:36.670 --> 50:37.490]  Have a good night buddy.
[50:37.490 --> 50:38.330]  Get well little man, yeah.

[50:44.110 --> 50:46.150]  What I'd really rather you do is follow me on Instagram.
[50:46.150 --> 50:46.990]  It's at I read genetics.
[50:46.990 --> 50:49.470]  A vital piece of equipment is down right now y'all.
[50:49.470 --> 50:51.510]  We need you to step up and help out the show.
[50:51.510 --> 50:52.750]  Ha ha ha ha.
[50:52.750 --> 50:55.350]  Yes, the coil on the Gmail has taken a shit.
[50:55.350 --> 50:56.670]  So if you wanna send a donation,
[50:56.670 --> 50:58.990]  go to I read genetics colorado.com,
[50:58.990 --> 51:00.750]  click on the grow from your heart podcast tab.

[51:20.230 --> 51:21.310]  Things would work out.
[51:21.310 --> 51:22.670]  And you'll never have to hear the torch
[51:22.670 --> 51:23.630]  coming through the microphone.
[51:23.630 --> 51:26.670]  You notice we didn't dab because the torch is just,
[51:26.670 --> 51:28.070]  so this is what it sounds like when you dab
[51:28.310 --> 51:29.150]  with the torch.
[51:29.150 --> 51:29.970]  When you're taking off.
[51:29.970 --> 51:30.990]  That's what you guys are missing.
[51:30.990 --> 51:32.870]  Sounds like a plane taking off, exactly.
[51:32.870 --> 51:34.630]  All right, we're on ramble the fuck mode.
[51:34.630 --> 51:35.670]  So we're gonna turn off the mics.
[51:35.670 --> 51:36.750]  We're gonna take some more dabs.
[51:36.750 --> 51:38.710]  We're gonna hang out and be bros for a few minutes.
[51:38.710 --> 51:39.830]  I wanna thank everybody for listening
[51:39.830 --> 51:41.430]  to this super long episode.
[51:41.430 --> 51:42.950]  I wanna give a shout out to Danielle.
[51:42.950 --> 51:43.790]  Good luck in Denver.
[51:43.790 --> 51:45.230]  I hope everything goes your way.
[51:45.230 --> 51:46.070]  Good luck, girl.
[51:46.070 --> 51:46.890]  Yeah, good luck.
[51:46.890 --> 51:47.730]  I wanna give a shout out to,
[51:47.730 --> 51:49.030]  hey, shout out to Spence and Maddie.
[51:49.030 --> 51:50.070]  They hit me up this afternoon.
[51:50.070 --> 51:51.150]  They're like, what you doing, fool?
[51:51.150 --> 51:51.990]  And I was like, I'm gardening.
[51:51.990 --> 51:52.990]  And they're like, you wanna go to lunch?

[51:53.830 --> 51:54.650]  I wanna go to lunch.
[51:54.650 --> 51:55.490]  We went and had pho.
