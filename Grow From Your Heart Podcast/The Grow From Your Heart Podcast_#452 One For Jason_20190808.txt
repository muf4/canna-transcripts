[00:00.000 --> 00:02.920]  All right, take 17 or somewhere around there.
[00:02.920 --> 00:06.520]  Welcome to episode 452 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.520 --> 00:11.480]  This episode of the show is dedicated to the life and memory of my friend Jason.
[00:11.480 --> 00:15.720]  Jason was battling cancer for a really long time, and I got the news that unfortunately
[00:15.720 --> 00:19.560]  last night he has lost his battle with cancer.
[00:19.560 --> 00:22.480]  I have a lot of great things written down that I want to talk about and things I want
[00:22.480 --> 00:26.800]  to say about my friend, but I'm not sure how much of that I can get through here on this
[00:27.800 --> 00:32.800]  please bear with me and join me while we honor my friend Jason.
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.460]  Now it is a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:37.460 --> 00:42.800]  My friend Jason was super important to everybody at the Green Dot Labs team.
[00:42.800 --> 00:45.440]  He was what my friend just called a, what did he call him?
[00:45.440 --> 00:48.200]  A coal in the fire for Green Dot Labs.
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.280]  If you needed a motivator, if you needed somebody to cheer you up and get you fucking started,
[00:52.280 --> 00:54.740]  Jason was the dude.
[00:54.740 --> 00:58.420]  So today I got myself some Green Dot Labs concentrates.
[00:58.420 --> 01:00.660]  I may have gone a little bit overboard.
[01:00.660 --> 01:05.260]  If Green Dot has it available right now, I am probably smoking some of it in honor of
[01:05.260 --> 01:06.460]  our boy Jay.
[01:06.460 --> 01:12.340]  So big fucking stupid size, ridiculous Green Dot dabs for our buddy Jason.
[01:12.340 --> 01:14.440]  That is a great way to start this dedication.
[01:14.440 --> 01:16.340]  I'm smoking Green Dot for you, bro.
[01:16.340 --> 01:19.700]  I hope you're catching the clouds I'm blowing your way.
[01:19.700 --> 01:20.700]  Now let's move forward.
[01:20.700 --> 01:22.700]  We know what we're dabbing on.
[01:22.700 --> 01:24.300]  Let's talk about this kid.
[01:24.860 --> 01:25.860]  Jason was a great guy.
[01:25.860 --> 01:28.740]  He was a couple of years older than me and I call him a kid because he was a fucking
[01:28.740 --> 01:29.740]  kid at heart.
[01:29.740 --> 01:30.740]  He knew how to do business.
[01:30.740 --> 01:35.380]  He knew how to take care of shit, but he wasn't burdened by adulthood.
[01:35.380 --> 01:38.860]  He didn't let all that business shit, he didn't let all the work stuff, it didn't slow him
[01:38.860 --> 01:39.860]  down.
[01:39.860 --> 01:40.860]  It didn't make a smile go away.
[01:40.860 --> 01:44.380]  He was going to make sure that we had a positive attitude, that we had fun, that everybody
[01:44.380 --> 01:45.500]  had what they needed.
[01:45.500 --> 01:48.780]  The work got done and then everybody got a hug and a high five at the end of the day.
[01:48.780 --> 01:50.340]  So he was a great fucking kid.
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.180]  Even though he was older than me, he was a good fucking dude.
[01:55.060 --> 01:57.380]  One thing that I've mentioned about Jay is positive attitude.
[01:57.380 --> 01:59.460]  That dude, you never see him.
[01:59.460 --> 02:01.220]  There are so many pictures of him on Facebook.
[02:01.220 --> 02:04.860]  That's another thing that is a testament of how awesome this kid was.
[02:04.860 --> 02:08.940]  If you look at all of the pictures on Facebook and everybody today has posted 10 pictures
[02:08.940 --> 02:11.340]  of this guy, everybody's got photos of him.
[02:11.340 --> 02:14.580]  Every picture, he has got a smile from ear to ear.
[02:14.580 --> 02:16.340]  The dude doesn't stop smiling.
[02:16.340 --> 02:19.660]  He beams love, he beams kindness.
[02:19.660 --> 02:23.860]  As a grown adult, sometimes we need advice from friends and sometimes you're kind of
[02:23.860 --> 02:28.020]  shy on who you're going to ask advice from, from friends, because most of my friends
[02:28.020 --> 02:29.740]  are in the same industry as myself.
[02:29.740 --> 02:31.540]  This industry can be competitive.
[02:31.540 --> 02:35.380]  A lot of my friends, including myself, have big fucking man egos and we don't want to
[02:35.380 --> 02:37.260]  ask other men for advice.
[02:37.260 --> 02:42.780]  I never felt shy or ashamed to just ask Jay for some guidance.
[02:42.780 --> 02:44.800]  Like, hey bro, here's what's happening.
[02:44.800 --> 02:45.800]  What would Jason do?
[02:45.800 --> 02:48.820]  And he'd be like, bro, I would fucking quit being a pussy and I would do it like this.
[02:48.820 --> 02:50.020]  And he'd be like, you're right.
[02:50.020 --> 02:51.940]  I knew that that's what somebody needed to say to me.
[02:51.940 --> 02:53.420]  I just needed you to say it.
[02:53.500 --> 02:54.500]  But he would motivate you.
[02:54.500 --> 02:55.660]  He would be positive with you.
[02:55.660 --> 02:56.660]  He would give you advice.
[02:56.660 --> 02:58.620]  He was filled with kindness.
[02:58.620 --> 03:02.980]  And even if you didn't see him for a while, we lived quite a ways away from each other.
[03:02.980 --> 03:03.980]  No excuse.
[03:03.980 --> 03:05.780]  Sometimes we wouldn't see each other for a while.
[03:05.780 --> 03:09.740]  When we did see each other, it was one of those, you know, you do the handshake, it's
[03:09.740 --> 03:13.420]  a handshake, it's a fist bump, and then it turns into a man hug and then you back up
[03:13.420 --> 03:16.220]  and you kind of high five and you just talk.
[03:16.220 --> 03:18.900]  It was that the moment we saw each other.
[03:18.900 --> 03:21.060]  His friendship was everlasting.
[03:21.060 --> 03:23.400]  His friendship was unconditional.
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.160]  And that unconditional love, that unconditional friendship shows through his social media.
[03:28.160 --> 03:32.200]  Everybody on social media is posting about how much they love this guy, about how much
[03:32.200 --> 03:33.600]  he helped them.
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.980]  Everybody's got a story about how Jay helped them.
[03:36.980 --> 03:39.960]  So when he got sick, everybody did their best to help him.
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.520]  We've all contributed to auctions and given donations and things to help our friend out.
[03:44.520 --> 03:45.520]  He was an amazing friend.
[03:45.520 --> 03:47.480]  He was a great person.
[03:47.480 --> 03:49.920]  He was just, he was a cool kid.
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.160]  He fucking showed up with his oversized grassroots hat and he was always fucking stylish, bro.
[03:54.160 --> 03:55.400]  He had the coolest clothes.
[03:55.400 --> 03:58.960]  I don't dress all stylish like that, but that kid dressed with mad fucking style, always
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.400]  had the coolest hats, just always positive, just cool as fuck.
[04:03.400 --> 04:05.880]  Always beamed this cool energy, this cool vibe.
[04:05.880 --> 04:07.560]  It was just love and kindness.
[04:07.560 --> 04:10.000]  Strangers would walk up to him and be like, Hey, you've got cool vibes.
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.320]  We need to be friends.
[04:11.320 --> 04:15.200]  So I wanted to share his vibe, share his love, make sure we continue his spirit, continue
[04:15.200 --> 04:16.200]  his energy.
[04:16.200 --> 04:19.400]  I wanted to express my love for the dude here on a show.
[04:19.400 --> 04:23.880]  Also I wanted to take this as a time to say thank you to my friend, Jason.
[04:23.880 --> 04:26.760]  I didn't say thank you face to face enough.
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.040]  I have many things to thank him for, just basically for the friendship.
[04:31.040 --> 04:32.360]  That is the first thing I would thank him for.
[04:32.360 --> 04:33.960]  He was a good friend.
[04:33.960 --> 04:34.960]  We had business talks.
[04:34.960 --> 04:35.960]  We had friend talks.
[04:35.960 --> 04:37.640]  We had relationship talks.
[04:37.640 --> 04:39.520]  We had all kinds of fun conversations.
[04:39.520 --> 04:44.480]  So I owe him a big thank you for all the inspiration, the advice, and for the friendship.
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.000]  And I wish I would have told him in person several, many more times.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.280]  I wish I had the opportunity to smoke a dab with that dude right now.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.600]  He would love all these concentrates I got on my table.
[04:53.600 --> 04:55.920]  He would tell me which one I had to smoke first.
[04:55.920 --> 04:56.920]  It would be fun.
[04:56.920 --> 04:58.200]  Going to miss my boy.
[04:58.200 --> 04:59.560]  Big shout out to Jason.
[04:59.560 --> 05:03.280]  The entire cannabis community is at a loss.
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.280]  Everybody feels it.
[05:04.280 --> 05:06.520]  The social media is in tears today.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.880]  Everybody misses you, Jay.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.680]  We wish you were all here.
[05:09.680 --> 05:12.440]  Now I don't have a smooth segue into the next portion of my show.
[05:12.440 --> 05:14.840]  There's really no smooth segue out of that last part.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.280]  So I'm just going to tell you what I want to talk about.
[05:18.280 --> 05:25.740]  This brought me to thinking that medical patients are basically pioneers and cannabis community
[05:25.740 --> 05:27.040]  leaders.
[05:27.040 --> 05:30.600]  My buddy Jason was very well-spoken for the cannabis community.
[05:30.600 --> 05:33.200]  He's been involved in medical cannabis since I knew him.
[05:33.200 --> 05:34.240]  That's how I met him.
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.280]  He was a huge part of the Colorado cannabis, medical and recreational cannabis community.
[05:39.280 --> 05:41.560]  He was a big part of the concentrate community.
[05:41.560 --> 05:46.600]  We found that a lot of the people who are using cannabis for medical purposes, concentrates
[05:46.600 --> 05:47.600]  work very well.
[05:47.600 --> 05:51.720]  You can take one dab and you can find great relief where before you may have had to smoke
[05:51.720 --> 05:54.260]  two or three bowls to get the same relief.
[05:54.260 --> 06:00.240]  So our boy Jay was a medical patient and I believe he was partially a pioneer.
[06:00.240 --> 06:05.160]  He's been making concentrates in Colorado since we were just coming, since the market
[06:05.160 --> 06:06.840]  was getting huge, he was there.
[06:06.840 --> 06:07.840]  He was part of it.
[06:07.840 --> 06:08.840]  He was one of the pioneers.
[06:08.840 --> 06:10.360]  He has earned that title.
[06:10.400 --> 06:15.200]  By being such a good dude, having such a good heart, being so outgoing, he also became a
[06:15.200 --> 06:16.880]  community leader.
[06:16.880 --> 06:21.880]  Everybody in the Colorado cannabis community knows who Jason is.
[06:21.880 --> 06:28.200]  I feel like every state that has legalized or will legalize medical cannabis will have
[06:28.200 --> 06:32.600]  a person like Jason in their area, in their demographic.
[06:32.600 --> 06:40.680]  We're all going to have that outgoing, charismatic, super friendly, business minded, family oriented
[06:40.680 --> 06:45.880]  kind of a business person who is also a patient and an activist and an advocate.
[06:45.880 --> 06:50.120]  And a lot of times those are the people who help us get the medical marijuana laws started
[06:50.120 --> 06:51.920]  and get things put in place.
[06:51.920 --> 06:54.800]  They're the ones who stand up for us at city council.
[06:54.800 --> 06:58.680]  They're the people who do their best to hold the city and counties accountable when things
[06:58.680 --> 07:03.000]  go wrong and the rules and regulations are backfired and citizens' rights and patients'
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.800]  rights are infringed upon.
[07:04.800 --> 07:07.380]  Those are the people who do that type of work.
[07:07.380 --> 07:09.400]  Those people are crucial to our team.
[07:09.400 --> 07:12.060]  Those people are critical for our cause.
[07:12.060 --> 07:17.440]  Without those people helping create the rules, without the people doing all of the petitioning,
[07:17.440 --> 07:23.840]  without the people doing all the city council work, the growers, the dispensaries, the trimmers,
[07:23.840 --> 07:25.500]  all of that stuff is useless.
[07:25.500 --> 07:28.500]  So those people are critical to our team.
[07:28.500 --> 07:33.500]  The reason many of those people are fighting so strongly to legalize medical cannabis and
[07:33.500 --> 07:39.140]  to uphold the rules and regulations that medical cannabis gives patients, those rights that
[07:39.140 --> 07:44.060]  we are afforded by those laws, the reason they fight so strongly is because cannabis
[07:44.060 --> 07:50.060]  is what they have found to help keep them alive or comfortable or to improve the quality
[07:50.060 --> 07:53.100]  of their lives in a significant way.
[07:53.100 --> 07:57.940]  And that is why they are out there fighting to legalize cannabis and to uphold patient
[07:58.380 --> 08:00.840]  rights because they are patients themselves.
[08:00.840 --> 08:05.780]  They know firsthand how well cannabis works to cure ailments in their lives.
[08:05.780 --> 08:06.940]  Who knows what their ailments are?
[08:06.940 --> 08:07.940]  Who cares?
[08:07.940 --> 08:11.140]  As long as cannabis is making it better, we should allow them to use it.
[08:11.140 --> 08:14.800]  So that's why many people become activists, become advocates.
[08:14.800 --> 08:20.180]  They want to heal themselves and they want to see that healing and that improvement in
[08:20.180 --> 08:22.340]  life amongst other people.
[08:22.340 --> 08:28.940]  So many cannabis advocates and activists are pioneers in their area is what I'm discovering.
[08:28.940 --> 08:32.940]  And that is because those people have passion and a purpose.
[08:32.940 --> 08:37.600]  They are passionate about medical cannabis because it is improving the overall quality
[08:37.600 --> 08:39.460]  of their daily life.
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.440]  Maybe they don't have as much pain.
[08:41.440 --> 08:42.740]  Maybe they're able to eat.
[08:42.740 --> 08:45.140]  Maybe it makes the PTSD go away.
[08:45.140 --> 08:47.140]  Maybe it makes the seizures stop.
[08:47.140 --> 08:49.060]  They are improving the quality of their life.
[08:49.060 --> 08:50.700]  They have got passion.
[08:50.700 --> 08:53.420]  And with that passion comes purpose.
[08:53.420 --> 08:56.660]  Cannabis is not legal, but it makes my ailments go away.
[08:56.660 --> 09:01.820]  I need to do everything I can to make cannabis available to myself and other people with
[09:01.820 --> 09:03.140]  this ailment.
[09:03.140 --> 09:06.260]  And so now you have added some purpose to that passion.
[09:06.260 --> 09:08.880]  You have got passion and you have got purpose.
[09:08.880 --> 09:11.340]  You were on the right track to actually do something.
[09:11.340 --> 09:15.800]  That's what makes somebody do something real, passion and purpose.
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.180]  So ladies and gentlemen, my advice to you is find your passion and find your purpose
[09:20.260 --> 09:22.660]  because your time is limited.
[09:22.660 --> 09:28.020]  Do what you love to do and figure out how doing what you love to do can be a purpose
[09:28.020 --> 09:29.020]  for the world.
[09:29.020 --> 09:30.300]  What are you contributing?
[09:30.300 --> 09:34.780]  Figure out a way to make your passion contribute positively to the world.
[09:34.780 --> 09:37.300]  If you don't worry about money, you will make your income.
[09:37.300 --> 09:38.340]  You will pay your rent.
[09:38.340 --> 09:39.340]  You will eat.
[09:39.340 --> 09:40.340]  You will not starve.
[09:40.340 --> 09:44.980]  You will not be homeless if you follow your passion and your purpose.
[09:44.980 --> 09:48.600]  Now there is one more important lesson that I've learned today.
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.440]  When you do find your passion and your purpose, no matter how committed and how dedicated
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.320]  you are, take a couple of minutes to tell a couple of your friends that you love them
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.480]  and that you're grateful that they're there because at any minute, they may not be there.
[10:01.480 --> 10:08.120]  So find your passion, find your purpose, but still make a few minutes out of every day
[10:08.120 --> 10:10.120]  to love the people who are important to you.
[10:10.120 --> 10:12.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up this quick episode.
[10:12.440 --> 10:14.400]  I apologize for a short episode.
[10:14.400 --> 10:15.920]  I've got some grieving to do on my own.
[10:15.920 --> 10:17.160]  I want to turn off this microphone.
[10:17.720 --> 10:20.400]  I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs for our boy Jason.
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.200]  I'm going to sit here in the quiet by myself and just think about my friends, think about
[10:24.200 --> 10:25.760]  things I'm grateful for.
[10:25.760 --> 10:28.000]  I'll be back Monday with a full-length episode.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.800]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this.
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.040]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Jason.
[10:32.040 --> 10:33.040]  I love you, brother.
[10:33.040 --> 10:36.480]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
