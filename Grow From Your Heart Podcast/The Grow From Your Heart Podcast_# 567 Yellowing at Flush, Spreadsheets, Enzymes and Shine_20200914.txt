[00:12.350 --> 00:14.670]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:14.670 --> 00:19.310]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and it is time for episode 567 of the
[00:19.310 --> 00:21.470]  Grow From Your Heart Podcast.

[00:57.110 --> 01:03.070]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:03.070 --> 01:08.190]  Today, I've been taking dabs of coin style live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:08.190 --> 01:11.870]  This is a blend of Sugartown Express and Lemon G13.
[01:11.870 --> 01:16.870]  On the package, the flavor is described as a coin style margarita on the rocks.
[01:16.870 --> 01:22.150]  Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I don't know what a coin style margarita on the rocks
[01:22.150 --> 01:23.150]  tastes like.
[01:23.150 --> 01:24.150]  I'm not an alcohol drinker.
[01:24.150 --> 01:28.750]  I don't consume any alcohol, so I haven't had a margarita in at least 10 or 12, maybe
[01:28.750 --> 01:29.750]  15 years.
[01:29.750 --> 01:31.190]  Don't remember what that tastes like.
[01:31.190 --> 01:33.390]  Couldn't tell you if that's an accurate description or not.
[01:33.390 --> 01:36.210]  What I can tell you is it's fucking delicious.
[01:36.370 --> 01:37.690]  That is an accurate description.
[01:37.690 --> 01:40.290]  A coin style margarita tastes fucking delicious.
[01:40.290 --> 01:41.610]  It is very lemony.
[01:41.610 --> 01:43.410]  It is very citrusy.
[01:43.410 --> 01:45.250]  It's got a little bit of a funk to it.
[01:45.250 --> 01:50.250]  I can actually really taste the Lemon G that is in the blend here, but that Sugartown,
[01:50.250 --> 01:53.330]  I think, is giving it a really nice sweetness.
[01:53.330 --> 01:57.370]  One thing I do really enjoy about this concentrate is it kind of fucks me up.
[01:57.370 --> 01:59.810]  It makes me, like, it puts on some blinders.
[01:59.810 --> 02:01.130]  It gives me, like, tunnel vision.
[02:01.130 --> 02:04.770]  It is the kind of concentrate that you may sit down thinking you're about to record a
[02:04.770 --> 02:05.770]  podcast.
[02:05.770 --> 02:08.330]  Next thing you know, you've checked your emails for 35 minutes.
[02:08.330 --> 02:09.330]  Time has flown by.
[02:09.330 --> 02:11.690]  You didn't even know any time had passed.
[02:11.690 --> 02:13.730]  You look up from the computer and you're thirsty as shit.
[02:13.730 --> 02:15.130]  You got to get back to work.
[02:15.130 --> 02:17.650]  You didn't even know you've been wasting 35 minutes.
[02:17.650 --> 02:21.930]  So that is the coin style live batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[02:21.930 --> 02:23.570]  I really enjoy this concentrate.
[02:23.570 --> 02:28.370]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 65.58% THC.
[02:28.370 --> 02:31.970]  I think the rest of that is straight up terps because this is so tasty.
[02:31.970 --> 02:33.250]  It is very potent.
[02:33.250 --> 02:36.770]  It leaves a nice flavor on the tongue, nice lingering aroma in the room.
[02:36.770 --> 02:41.090]  I obviously enjoy the coin style live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[02:41.090 --> 02:43.970]  Just shout out to our friends at Green Dot for the delicious concentrate.
[02:43.970 --> 02:45.490]  I'll show the camera the concentrate here.
[02:45.490 --> 02:48.370]  Of course, you can see I took a big old dollop out of that gram.
[02:48.370 --> 02:50.930]  Delicious, beautiful texture, beautiful color.
[02:50.930 --> 02:51.930]  Great work from Green Dot.
[02:51.930 --> 02:53.970]  All right, let's move into the show.
[02:53.970 --> 02:57.770]  In this episode, I'm going to do a couple of updates from previous episodes.
[02:57.770 --> 03:00.650]  Then we're going to read some Patreon messages.
[03:00.650 --> 03:04.730]  Before we get to that part, let's do some shout outs to the members of the 710 Club.
[03:04.730 --> 03:10.090]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support the show at the $7.10 a month level
[03:10.090 --> 03:11.970]  or higher on Patreon.
[03:11.970 --> 03:14.050]  So with no further ado, let's do some shout outs.
[03:14.050 --> 03:16.490]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:16.490 --> 03:17.490]  Thank you.
[03:17.490 --> 03:18.490]  Shout out to Miss Karen Crawford.
[03:18.490 --> 03:20.290]  Let's send another thank you shout out to Canna Reaper.
[03:20.290 --> 03:22.650]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Prospect.
[03:22.650 --> 03:25.170]  I've always got a big thank you shout out for Craig Compton.
[03:25.170 --> 03:27.770]  I need to send a big thank you shout out to North Terps.
[03:27.770 --> 03:28.770]  What up, North?
[03:28.770 --> 03:29.770]  I see you pop up a lot.
[03:29.890 --> 03:31.890]  I've always got a big thank you shout out for Tommy.
[03:31.890 --> 03:34.330]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to Ned Denver.
[03:34.330 --> 03:36.650]  I want to say thank you to Steven D. Smith.
[03:36.650 --> 03:39.050]  I also want to send a giant thank you to Lefty's Farms.
[03:39.050 --> 03:40.050]  What's up, bro?
[03:40.050 --> 03:41.050]  Hope you're doing well.
[03:41.050 --> 03:43.010]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Rasta K.
[03:43.010 --> 03:44.690]  Also a big thank you to Kent.
[03:44.690 --> 03:49.050]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[03:49.050 --> 03:51.850]  shout out to our friend Victor.
[03:51.850 --> 03:55.390]  Big thank you and big shout out for all of the continued support.
[03:55.390 --> 03:58.290]  If you are not already supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how
[03:58.290 --> 04:05.530]  to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[04:05.530 --> 04:09.730]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[04:09.730 --> 04:13.890]  All right, I did say I was going to do some updates in this episode.
[04:13.890 --> 04:16.490]  In a previous episode, I talked about grafting.
[04:16.490 --> 04:20.970]  I read a message from a Patreon supporter about grafting cannabis plants.
[04:20.970 --> 04:25.450]  And I said that I feel like the genetics may move around if we graft multiple plants onto
[04:25.450 --> 04:26.450]  one branch.
[04:26.610 --> 04:30.770]  I said a lot of maybe slightly negative things in my opinion about grafting that were very
[04:30.770 --> 04:33.610]  uneducated and I was very clear that those were my opinions.
[04:33.610 --> 04:34.970]  And I had no education.
[04:34.970 --> 04:35.970]  I'd never done it.
[04:35.970 --> 04:37.490]  And I said it seemed silly to me.
[04:37.490 --> 04:38.490]  I was corrected.
[04:38.490 --> 04:41.330]  If I make a grafted plant, those genetics will not move.
[04:41.330 --> 04:44.490]  Each branch apparently will stay true to that genetic.
[04:44.490 --> 04:45.810]  Somehow the genetics don't move around.
[04:45.810 --> 04:47.170]  I don't understand that part.
[04:47.170 --> 04:48.770]  I am willing to admit that.
[04:48.770 --> 04:51.250]  So I got a lot of great corrections and updates.
[04:51.250 --> 04:52.970]  Grafting seems to be a viable practice.
[04:52.970 --> 04:54.890]  I apologize for bashing that.
[04:54.890 --> 04:56.650]  The genes don't move around.
[04:56.650 --> 05:02.330]  We wouldn't have good apples if grafting wasn't a common practice.
[05:02.330 --> 05:04.610]  Now let's move into another update.
[05:04.610 --> 05:07.090]  We had a blind grower send us a message.
[05:07.090 --> 05:09.530]  Shout out to our friend David in Brazil.
[05:09.530 --> 05:14.730]  Send us a message saying that they think their plants may be finishing too early.
[05:14.730 --> 05:18.090]  As soon as that episode went out, I got a lot of great feedback.
[05:18.090 --> 05:19.730]  So let's do some updates.
[05:19.730 --> 05:23.990]  Most of the feedback came from the YouTube channel and they were great ideas.
[05:24.090 --> 05:29.310]  One listener or viewer, since it was from YouTube, one viewer suggested that since this
[05:29.310 --> 05:35.630]  grow is possibly in Brazil, that maybe the equatorial location is giving those plants
[05:35.630 --> 05:40.950]  super intense sun and they are finishing earlier simply because they are getting more sun.
[05:40.950 --> 05:43.070]  More sun is more energy for the plants.
[05:43.070 --> 05:46.990]  You've heard me talk about turning my light cycle on to 18-6 at the end of flower the
[05:46.990 --> 05:48.410]  last 10 days.
[05:48.410 --> 05:50.870]  That way it'll beef up the buds because they get more light.
[05:50.870 --> 05:52.990]  Of course, more light is more energy.
[05:52.990 --> 05:57.870]  So yes, maybe they are finishing more quickly because of that intense mountain sun.
[05:57.870 --> 06:00.710]  Breeder Steve talks about some plants finishing earlier.
[06:00.710 --> 06:02.110]  I think he's in South America.
[06:02.110 --> 06:03.110]  I can't remember.
[06:03.110 --> 06:04.110]  I think he said Columbia.
[06:04.110 --> 06:05.350]  That may be where he is.
[06:05.350 --> 06:09.390]  Breeder Steve's plants finish sooner near the equator.
[06:09.390 --> 06:10.390]  So that may be a thing.
[06:10.390 --> 06:13.630]  You may be getting that brighter sun, that equatorial sun.
[06:13.630 --> 06:15.430]  The environment is just right.
[06:15.430 --> 06:20.910]  Maybe that is one of the reasons why our friend is getting earlier finishing plants.
[06:20.910 --> 06:25.670]  Another thing that we thought of is maybe perhaps the, and our friend is blind, so he's
[06:25.670 --> 06:27.830]  got a helper who is helping them.
[06:27.830 --> 06:30.930]  Maybe that helper is not looking at trichomes.
[06:30.930 --> 06:34.030]  They stated that the trichomes were brown.
[06:34.030 --> 06:38.670]  Maybe perhaps we have thought that maybe they're not looking at trichomes and perhaps they're
[06:38.670 --> 06:42.270]  looking at pistils because pistils do turn brown.
[06:42.270 --> 06:47.130]  However, pistils are not the indicator of ripeness when it comes to a cannabis plant.
[06:47.130 --> 06:50.090]  Pistils are basically the sex parts for a cannabis plant.
[06:50.090 --> 06:55.370]  And when a cannabis plant passes its prime time for being bred, the pistils simply shrivel up.
[06:55.370 --> 07:00.370]  Also pistils will shrivel up from disruption, from moisture, from foliar sprays, from you
[07:00.370 --> 07:03.690]  touching it, from an insect crawling on it, from wind.
[07:03.690 --> 07:08.290]  A lot of things will cause pistils to curl up and basically wither and die.
[07:08.290 --> 07:15.370]  So possibly, we assume, we think that possibly this assistant is looking at pistils and not trichomes.
[07:15.370 --> 07:18.610]  So we need to clarify the difference between a pistol and a trichome.
[07:18.610 --> 07:22.130]  The things that everybody calls a red hair, those are your pistils.
[07:22.130 --> 07:24.010]  Those are the parts where the pollen will land.
[07:24.010 --> 07:27.970]  The pollen will go down that into an ovule and create a seed inside of your bud.
[07:27.970 --> 07:29.130]  That's what that is for.
[07:29.130 --> 07:31.890]  A trichome is a completely different part of the plant.
[07:31.890 --> 07:33.770]  It is the part that everybody calls the crystals.
[07:33.770 --> 07:35.450]  So you got hairs and crystals.
[07:35.450 --> 07:38.010]  Those are now pistils and trichomes if you want to keep up.
[07:38.010 --> 07:39.850]  The trichomes are what indicate ripeness.
[07:39.850 --> 07:41.790]  We are smoking ripe trichomes.
[07:41.790 --> 07:46.350]  We just happen to have those trichomes delivered to us on a green leafy matter.
[07:46.350 --> 07:49.950]  When we make concentrate, we basically remove the trichomes from the green leafy matter.
[07:49.950 --> 07:52.030]  That's why we get more lit more easily.
[07:52.030 --> 07:53.870]  There's not as much green stuff to smoke.
[07:53.870 --> 07:59.630]  Everything you're smoking is basically extracted trichomes and the oils from those trichomes.
[07:59.630 --> 08:04.790]  So we need to make sure that the assistant is looking at trichomes and not looking at pistils.
[08:04.790 --> 08:06.190]  That is a huge difference.
[08:06.190 --> 08:09.910]  The mushroom things that you see on the plant, all over the plant, the crystals, if you look
[08:09.910 --> 08:12.670]  at them with a scope, with the magnifier, they look like mushrooms.
[08:12.670 --> 08:13.670]  They got a stalk.
[08:13.670 --> 08:14.970]  They have a bulbous head on them.
[08:14.970 --> 08:15.970]  Those are the trichomes.
[08:15.970 --> 08:17.470]  Those are what we are looking for.
[08:17.470 --> 08:23.650]  We want those in most cases with most cultivars, with most growers, for most ideal conditions.
[08:23.650 --> 08:28.310]  I can't say all the time because there's never an all the time in cannabis.
[08:28.310 --> 08:32.510]  But most of the time, most growers want to harvest when those trichomes appear to be
[08:32.510 --> 08:34.550]  about 30% amber.
[08:34.550 --> 08:39.150]  So if you can get 100 trichomes in your view, or if you can look around and see about 100
[08:39.150 --> 08:43.510]  trichomes, you want 30 of those 100 trichomes to be turning an amber color.
[08:43.510 --> 08:45.290]  You will see clear trichomes.
[08:45.290 --> 08:48.290]  You'll see trichomes that have turned like a milky white color.
[08:48.290 --> 08:50.810]  You'll see trichomes that are almost a baby blue.
[08:50.810 --> 08:53.110]  They've got like a silver and bluish tint to them.
[08:53.110 --> 08:57.570]  Then you will also see some that are starting to turn like a brownish color on the inside.
[08:57.570 --> 09:02.490]  Then you will see some trichomes that look like they've got Dr. Pepper or soda on them.
[09:02.490 --> 09:04.150]  Those are the ripe trichomes.
[09:04.150 --> 09:08.450]  Right when you start to see those dark ones are probably a little bit past your peak point.
[09:08.750 --> 09:13.250]  If you've got 30% amber trichomes, the rest of the trichomes, you've got 70% that are
[09:13.250 --> 09:15.770]  going to be right where you want them to be.
[09:15.770 --> 09:20.330]  So we want to harvest at 30%, 25, 30% amber trichomes.
[09:20.330 --> 09:24.530]  Again we need a scope, a magnifying glass to see the color of the heads of the trichomes.
[09:24.530 --> 09:26.490]  But that is when we should be harvesting.
[09:26.490 --> 09:30.730]  I think most of the growers here have listened to my Determining Ripeness podcast.
[09:30.730 --> 09:33.210]  So again, look at the trichomes, not the hairs.
[09:33.210 --> 09:37.030]  That is another thing that we think may be happening in this situation.
[09:37.030 --> 09:39.310]  And again, I'm not accusing or making judgments.
[09:39.310 --> 09:44.430]  These are just ideas that myself and other growers think may be causing this issue.
[09:44.430 --> 09:45.430]  And it's not really an issue.
[09:45.430 --> 09:49.670]  If the plants are finishing too early, that means you're getting buds too early.
[09:49.670 --> 09:50.910]  You get to harvest too early.
[09:50.910 --> 09:52.770]  You get your crop earlier.
[09:52.770 --> 09:54.470]  You're not going to risk a lot of problems.
[09:54.470 --> 09:59.890]  In Colorado right now, it was 85 to 100 degrees for a month straight.
[09:59.890 --> 10:04.550]  Everybody was looking sunburned and looking burned out and sweaty and tired from the heat.
[10:04.550 --> 10:07.590]  And last night, it got to 32 degrees.
[10:07.590 --> 10:10.750]  Right now I'm looking at my little indicator to show me the temperature.
[10:10.750 --> 10:13.270]  It is 36 degrees outside.
[10:13.270 --> 10:15.590]  In the next few days, it is going to go back up.
[10:15.590 --> 10:20.150]  It is going to go back up to probably 80 or 90 degrees.
[10:20.150 --> 10:25.230]  All of these giant temperature swings give us opportunity for huge problems in the grow.
[10:25.230 --> 10:29.750]  Here in Colorado, a lot of crops were lost to a surprise snowstorm here at the start
[10:29.750 --> 10:30.750]  of September.
[10:30.750 --> 10:33.590]  We probably don't expect snow until around Halloween.
[10:33.590 --> 10:36.190]  On September 8th and 9th, we were hit with snow.
[10:36.190 --> 10:39.030]  A lot of crops were destroyed outdoors.
[10:39.030 --> 10:43.070]  So those people that have early finishing plants that finish too early, maybe you're
[10:43.070 --> 10:45.630]  going to get lucky and beat that early snowstorm.
[10:45.630 --> 10:49.650]  You probably don't have a snowstorm coming in Brazil, but you do have something coming.
[10:49.650 --> 10:52.790]  Maybe police, maybe robbers, maybe animals.
[10:52.790 --> 10:54.590]  Maybe there's something out there that could destroy your crop.
[10:54.590 --> 10:58.150]  So if it's down too early, that means it's down too early.
[10:58.150 --> 11:01.830]  In Colorado, we got a lot of crops destroyed by snowstorms.
[11:01.830 --> 11:05.430]  In California, crops are getting destroyed by wildfires.
[11:05.430 --> 11:10.470]  There is a very good likelihood that when harvest time comes, maybe only half to a third
[11:10.470 --> 11:14.670]  of the expected crops outdoors are going to be cut down and brought to the market this
[11:14.670 --> 11:15.670]  year.
[11:15.670 --> 11:20.270]  So there's a very good opportunity and potential that prices will rise at the end of this year
[11:20.270 --> 11:21.790]  and the start of next year.
[11:21.790 --> 11:26.210]  So people that are used to paying that low price for their cannabis, shit may go back
[11:26.210 --> 11:28.410]  up because of all these natural things happening.
[11:28.410 --> 11:30.650]  The snowstorms ruined a lot of money.
[11:30.650 --> 11:33.050]  The fires are burning down a lot of money.
[11:33.050 --> 11:35.370]  We're going to lose a lot of cannabis farms to these fires.
[11:35.370 --> 11:36.890]  We're going to lose a lot of genetics.
[11:36.890 --> 11:38.410]  We're going to lose a lot of important shit.
[11:38.410 --> 11:41.850]  So while I'm thinking about it, I want to send some love to all the people suffering
[11:41.850 --> 11:44.250]  through these fucking fires and snowstorms right now.
[11:44.250 --> 11:48.650]  My heart goes out to everybody, but big respect and big love to all the farmers losing shit.
[11:48.650 --> 11:52.390]  All right, I need to get myself back the fuck on track.
[11:52.390 --> 11:57.110]  Your crop may be finishing early because of your equatorial location.
[11:57.110 --> 11:59.710]  Also you may be looking at pistils, not trichomes.
[11:59.710 --> 12:01.030]  See I'm getting myself back on track.
[12:01.030 --> 12:02.030]  It is working.
[12:02.030 --> 12:07.990]  Another theory that we think may be happening in this grow is you were saying that the plants
[12:07.990 --> 12:11.990]  are finishing about 21 days too early.
[12:11.990 --> 12:18.450]  Maybe perhaps you were judging the first day of flower at the first sign of pistils and
[12:18.450 --> 12:21.870]  not actually the first day the plants go into flower.
[12:21.870 --> 12:26.910]  If you are seeing pistils and you're considering that the first day of flower, I would recommend
[12:26.910 --> 12:29.590]  backing your calendar up about two weeks.
[12:29.590 --> 12:35.350]  It takes about 10 to 14 days to see pistils on a flowering plant in most cases.
[12:35.350 --> 12:37.070]  I can't say all the time.
[12:37.070 --> 12:41.230]  Every time when it comes to cannabis, there are always going to be anomalies.
[12:41.230 --> 12:47.630]  Most of the time in cannabis, we can see pre-flower, we can see sex in about 14 days.
[12:47.830 --> 12:51.870]  If you're judging the day one from the time you start seeing those pre-flowers, those
[12:51.870 --> 12:56.590]  pistils pop up, you can adjust your calendar, your schedule by about two weeks and you can
[12:56.590 --> 13:00.970]  say they've been in flower for two weeks longer than what you've been saying, which may put
[13:00.970 --> 13:05.470]  you right on the schedule that the breeders recommended on the back of those packages.
[13:05.470 --> 13:07.630]  Those are the things we think may be happening.
[13:07.630 --> 13:11.790]  You may be getting a faster finishing plant because of your location on the equator.
[13:11.790 --> 13:17.430]  You may be looking at pistils and not trichomes and you may be judging by the wrong start
[13:17.430 --> 13:18.430]  day of flower.
[13:18.430 --> 13:23.590]  You may be judging day 14 as day one, somewhere around day 10 to 17, you may be mistaking
[13:23.590 --> 13:25.550]  that for day one.
[13:25.550 --> 13:26.830]  Maybe I'm not in your grow.
[13:26.830 --> 13:29.230]  Like I said, I can't accuse you or blame you on anything.
[13:29.230 --> 13:32.470]  These are just theories that we think may be happening or trying to help you out.
[13:32.470 --> 13:34.470]  So we're sharing ideas.
[13:34.470 --> 13:35.870]  Check on these three things.
[13:35.870 --> 13:39.950]  See if these three things can be causing your not problem problem.
[13:39.950 --> 13:45.310]  I don't think it's a problem, so there's nothing to correct here, but maybe, like I said before,
[13:45.310 --> 13:50.110]  if you are looking at pistils and not trichomes, we may want to let these plants go a little
[13:50.110 --> 13:51.110]  bit longer.
[13:51.110 --> 13:54.350]  So if you're not looking at the right part of the plant to judge maturity, maybe you
[13:54.350 --> 13:55.830]  can improve your crop.
[13:55.830 --> 13:57.630]  You didn't say you were happy with it.
[13:57.630 --> 13:59.870]  Maybe you can be even happier.
[13:59.870 --> 14:00.910]  Send me another email.
[14:00.910 --> 14:02.270]  Let me know if I helped you out.
[14:02.270 --> 14:03.270]  Thanks for all the great feedback.
[14:03.270 --> 14:04.710]  Thank you for the great interaction.
[14:04.710 --> 14:06.950]  And I do look forward to hearing back from you.
[14:06.950 --> 14:10.990]  Also, big thanks to all of my friends who left a comment on the YouTube video or sent
[14:10.990 --> 14:15.710]  me a message with their theory or their idea of what they think could be happening in this
[14:15.710 --> 14:16.990]  person's grow.
[14:16.990 --> 14:20.910]  I do come on this show and I get all of the credit for putting this show together, but
[14:20.910 --> 14:22.230]  I've got to give you guys credit.
[14:22.230 --> 14:27.110]  A lot of people gave me feedback, input, advice, and information on this exact topic.
[14:27.110 --> 14:30.190]  And without you guys, this episode wouldn't have been what it is.
[14:30.190 --> 14:31.190]  So thank you.
[14:31.190 --> 14:35.210]  I also appreciate all of the emails and interaction because I love getting emails and knowing
[14:35.210 --> 14:38.190]  that the questions I read are actually helping somebody.
[14:38.190 --> 14:41.910]  I'll write shows about random topics, re-vegging or drying and curing.
[14:41.910 --> 14:43.750]  I know that stuff will go well.
[14:43.750 --> 14:46.630]  Sometimes I get ideas and I'll do a show and I'm like, I wonder if anybody even needs this
[14:46.630 --> 14:47.630]  advice.
[14:47.630 --> 14:50.630]  So when you send me a message and you say, hey, help, that really helps me out.
[14:50.630 --> 14:54.670]  So thank you guys for all the participation, the feedback, the input.
[14:54.670 --> 14:56.150]  That shit means a lot to me.
[14:56.150 --> 14:57.150]  I'm going to quit rambling.
[14:57.150 --> 15:01.030]  I'm telling you this coin style live batter, it will fuck your brain up.
[15:01.030 --> 15:05.430]  You'll get a lot of stuff done, but it won't be any of the shit you intended to do.
[15:05.430 --> 15:06.510]  Let's get back on track here.
[15:06.510 --> 15:08.110]  I've got a Patreon message.
[15:08.150 --> 15:10.230]  This one comes from our friend Xavier.
[15:10.230 --> 15:11.230]  What's up, bro?
[15:11.230 --> 15:12.230]  Good to hear from you.
[15:12.230 --> 15:14.430]  This one goes a lot like this.
[15:14.430 --> 15:15.790]  It says, yo, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[15:15.790 --> 15:18.670]  I really want to thank you for your hard work.
[15:18.670 --> 15:19.670]  Thank you, bro.
[15:19.670 --> 15:20.670]  I'm glad you notice it.
[15:20.670 --> 15:22.270]  It says, creating all of your killer genetics.
[15:22.270 --> 15:25.950]  Oh, it says, I want to thank you for all of your hard work creating all of your killer
[15:25.950 --> 15:26.950]  genetics.
[15:26.950 --> 15:28.710]  I'm glad you find my genetics killer.
[15:28.710 --> 15:30.750]  I want to see pics of your grow.
[15:30.750 --> 15:35.910]  It goes on to say, your amazing podcast helped me get through my third grow with ease and
[15:35.910 --> 15:36.910]  confidence.
[15:36.910 --> 15:38.350]  Thank you so much for that.
[15:38.350 --> 15:39.910]  I appreciate it.
[15:39.910 --> 15:43.950]  I love hearing that I'm making your grow easier and making you more confident.
[15:43.950 --> 15:44.950]  That's the idea.
[15:44.950 --> 15:48.030]  I want to make you more comfortable, more confident in your grow so that you can make
[15:48.030 --> 15:49.310]  decisions on the fly.
[15:49.310 --> 15:51.470]  You don't panic when shit goes wrong.
[15:51.470 --> 15:52.470]  That's my goal here.
[15:52.470 --> 15:54.150]  So I love hearing that I'm hitting the goal.
[15:54.150 --> 15:56.670]  I love hearing that you're getting toward your goal with my help.
[15:56.670 --> 15:58.230]  Also, that means a lot.
[15:58.230 --> 15:59.550]  I should continue.
[15:59.550 --> 16:04.230]  It says, I've just harvested some Lemon Jeffrey, Orangegasm, Bebop, and The Cream.
[16:04.230 --> 16:05.910]  You've got a nice selection.
[16:05.910 --> 16:09.950]  The Lemon Jeffrey's got those lemon turps, the Orangegasm, of course, the orange turps.
[16:09.950 --> 16:13.630]  Bebop has got that cushy possibility if you get the right phenotypes.
[16:13.630 --> 16:15.070]  And The Cream is unique in its own.
[16:15.070 --> 16:18.150]  It's got that root beer cream soda sort of a turp to it.
[16:18.150 --> 16:20.270]  And if you're making concentrates, The Cream is the boss.
[16:20.270 --> 16:21.470]  Anyway, it goes on.
[16:21.470 --> 16:24.310]  It says, these plants blew my freaking mind.
[16:24.310 --> 16:25.750]  I love hearing that.
[16:25.750 --> 16:28.790]  They put on some insane harvest weight.
[16:28.790 --> 16:29.790]  This is good advertising.
[16:29.790 --> 16:31.430]  I did not write this message.
[16:31.430 --> 16:35.550]  It says, all I had to do was make sure that all of my girls were nice and comfy in a trellis
[16:36.190 --> 16:39.110]  setting with lots of plant stakes for extra support.
[16:39.110 --> 16:41.310]  I'm going to interrupt you.
[16:41.310 --> 16:45.590]  If you did the trellising properly, you won't need those extra supports.
[16:45.590 --> 16:47.270]  I'm not trying to dog you, not trying to diss you.
[16:47.270 --> 16:49.550]  We're going to improve your grow right now.
[16:49.550 --> 16:51.590]  Where you think you had to add extra, had it.
[16:51.590 --> 16:52.590]  I said had it.
[16:52.590 --> 16:53.590]  I did that again.
[16:53.590 --> 16:54.590]  Not even editing it.
[16:54.590 --> 16:55.590]  We're going to keep moving.
[16:55.590 --> 16:56.950]  I say weird shit.
[16:56.950 --> 17:00.670]  If you had added, I think that's what I meant to say.
[17:00.670 --> 17:06.550]  If you had added a third net to hold those buds up, or if you had worked those branches
[17:06.550 --> 17:10.510]  into that net properly, you wouldn't have needed, my words are all fucked up.
[17:10.510 --> 17:11.750]  We'll get back there in a minute.
[17:11.750 --> 17:13.090]  You would not have needed stakes.
[17:13.090 --> 17:16.590]  The idea when you're making a trellis is to get that canopy nice and even.
[17:16.590 --> 17:20.430]  The ones that are sticking up that you needed a stake for, probably, again, I can't see
[17:20.430 --> 17:21.430]  your grow, dude.
[17:21.430 --> 17:22.430]  I don't know what's going on.
[17:22.430 --> 17:25.830]  You probably could have worked those branches in just a little bit more and kept the canopy
[17:25.830 --> 17:27.070]  nice and even.
[17:27.070 --> 17:30.110]  If you've got a few sticking up where you needed a few stakes, I would have put another
[17:30.110 --> 17:31.110]  layer.
[17:31.110 --> 17:32.110]  Did I say it again?
[17:32.110 --> 17:33.110]  I don't know.
[17:33.110 --> 17:36.870]  I would have put another layer of trellis net to keep all those branches in there.
[17:36.870 --> 17:38.150]  But I don't know what you're doing.
[17:38.150 --> 17:39.150]  Send me some pictures.
[17:39.150 --> 17:40.150]  I think you did.
[17:40.150 --> 17:41.750]  I'm going to look at your pictures and see if we can help you out.
[17:41.750 --> 17:43.590]  Anyway, let's continue with this email.
[17:43.590 --> 17:45.310]  Just wanted to talk about the trellising.
[17:45.310 --> 17:46.310]  Get them even.
[17:46.310 --> 17:47.690]  The idea is to get a nice, even canopy.
[17:47.690 --> 17:48.790]  Get those sticks out of there.
[17:48.790 --> 17:50.830]  Of course, if you need them, that may be a good thing.
[17:50.830 --> 17:52.110]  I can't see your grow.
[17:52.110 --> 17:53.110]  Let's stay focused.
[17:53.110 --> 17:58.590]  As I dialed in my environment and I feed all of my girls, the feed just went as wild as
[17:58.590 --> 18:00.290]  I wanted them to do.
[18:00.290 --> 18:05.750]  They fattened up all the way up till harvest, but I was not able to get all of my plants
[18:05.750 --> 18:07.350]  to yellow in flush.
[18:07.350 --> 18:09.430]  All right, so the grow went great.
[18:09.430 --> 18:14.230]  It sounds like everything went well, but during the flush phase, the plants did not yellow
[18:14.230 --> 18:15.230]  as expected.
[18:15.230 --> 18:20.310]  I don't find that to be a problem, but it goes on to say, I was literally flooding them
[18:20.310 --> 18:23.930]  for two weeks and I only got a couple of plants to yellow.
[18:23.930 --> 18:28.990]  If some of my plants didn't yellow at all, even though I flushed the shit out of them,
[18:28.990 --> 18:33.070]  does that mean I still have a lot of nutrients trapped in my buds?
[18:33.070 --> 18:36.630]  I was growing in soil with 1200 ppms in flowering.
[18:36.630 --> 18:40.230]  By the time I got done with my flush, my runoff was very low for soil.
[18:40.230 --> 18:45.710]  I think 110 ppms, and this is combined runoff from multiple plants that were flushed.
[18:45.710 --> 18:46.990]  All right.
[18:46.990 --> 18:49.950]  This is a very good and unique question.
[18:49.950 --> 18:54.510]  A lot of people, when they flush their plants, they expect and want to see the plants start
[18:54.510 --> 18:55.750]  to turn yellow.
[18:55.750 --> 18:57.950]  They think we're flushing the nutrients out of here.
[18:57.950 --> 18:59.110]  These plants should turn yellow.
[18:59.110 --> 19:01.230]  They should start fading and showing me their fall colors.
[19:01.230 --> 19:02.990]  They're about to die.
[19:02.990 --> 19:05.530]  That is not always necessary.
[19:05.530 --> 19:09.310]  You do not have to get yellow, dead, crispy looking plants at the end of your grow.
[19:09.310 --> 19:11.390]  They can be nice and green and lush.
[19:11.390 --> 19:14.490]  They don't have to be yellow and crunchy and faded.
[19:14.490 --> 19:15.490]  It's really cool.
[19:15.490 --> 19:16.490]  It looks really nice.
[19:16.490 --> 19:19.750]  I love taking pictures when they start turning like a little bit of golden colors at the
[19:20.550 --> 19:24.550]  end, they get those red hues, the purple start coming in, but they don't have to fade.
[19:24.550 --> 19:27.950]  Some genetics will not fade no matter, I guess they all fade no matter what you do to them.
[19:27.950 --> 19:31.710]  They'll run out of nutrients eventually, but some, they just look happy right up to the
[19:31.710 --> 19:33.630]  end.
[19:33.630 --> 19:34.630]  How is the smoke?
[19:34.630 --> 19:35.710]  That's what really matters.
[19:35.710 --> 19:36.710]  Did you cut them down?
[19:36.710 --> 19:38.190]  Have you dried them and cured them?
[19:38.190 --> 19:39.750]  How do they smoke?
[19:39.750 --> 19:43.950]  The dry and cure process is really going to play a huge role in this, but does it smoke
[19:43.950 --> 19:44.950]  well?
[19:44.950 --> 19:45.950]  Does it smoke harshly?
[19:45.950 --> 19:46.950]  Does it smoke smoothly?
[19:46.950 --> 19:47.950]  Does it taste good?
[19:47.950 --> 19:48.950]  Does the ash burn white?
[19:49.150 --> 19:50.150]  Does it taste chunky?
[19:50.150 --> 19:53.470]  If you roll it into a joint or pack it into a bowl and take a few hits off of it, does
[19:53.470 --> 19:57.430]  the part you smoke turn into like a charcoal briquette or does it turn into a white flaky
[19:57.430 --> 19:58.950]  soft ash?
[19:58.950 --> 20:02.030]  That's really the way to judge if it was flushed properly or not.
[20:02.030 --> 20:05.430]  And if you dried and cured it, those two things are going to come into play together at the
[20:05.430 --> 20:06.430]  end here.
[20:06.430 --> 20:08.790]  So it's all about how is the smoke?
[20:08.790 --> 20:12.590]  You say you were trying to get all of the nutrients out.
[20:12.590 --> 20:15.430]  Does it mean you still have nutrients trapped in my buds?
[20:15.430 --> 20:17.110]  I don't...
[20:17.110 --> 20:21.650]  There's a lot of controversy around flushing and not flushing right now, and I'm trying
[20:21.650 --> 20:22.710]  not to pick a side.
[20:22.710 --> 20:26.470]  I'm trying to stay open-minded as somebody who teaches and shares information.
[20:26.470 --> 20:27.470]  I can't pick a side.
[20:27.470 --> 20:31.230]  I can't be biased in this topic because I don't have enough information.
[20:31.230 --> 20:37.270]  But when I think about flushing, I think that I'm trying to clean out the soil or the medium
[20:37.270 --> 20:40.790]  to get that clean so that the plants don't have any more to eat.
[20:40.790 --> 20:43.810]  Just they're going to simply quit eating.
[20:43.810 --> 20:48.370]  There are nutrients and sugars stored throughout the plant, mainly in the leaves.
[20:48.370 --> 20:54.790]  But the stuff in the buds, I feel like that has been metabolized and converted into buds.
[20:54.790 --> 21:00.070]  It's no longer nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, molybdenum, calcium, magnesium, boron, several
[21:00.070 --> 21:01.890]  other nutrients and elements.
[21:01.890 --> 21:03.470]  It is now bud material.
[21:03.470 --> 21:05.250]  Like today, nobody cares what I ate.
[21:05.250 --> 21:06.730]  I had food today.
[21:06.730 --> 21:09.190]  That food is not food inside of me.
[21:09.190 --> 21:10.530]  It is now in my blood.
[21:10.530 --> 21:13.930]  It's becoming muscle tissue, skin, not much muscle.
[21:13.930 --> 21:15.730]  I'm fucking skinny, but it's trying.
[21:15.730 --> 21:16.790]  It's making muscle tissue.
[21:16.790 --> 21:17.790]  It's making skin.
[21:17.790 --> 21:19.110]  It's making my blood move.
[21:19.110 --> 21:21.130]  It's providing me vitamins.
[21:21.130 --> 21:24.930]  So there was vitamin C and iron in my food today.
[21:24.930 --> 21:27.850]  I am not iron and vitamin C right now.
[21:27.850 --> 21:32.290]  There's a lot of those things that have turned into parts of me that have become part of
[21:32.290 --> 21:33.290]  me.
[21:33.290 --> 21:37.790]  And when I go pee or poop, it's not going to be vitamin C and iron that comes out.
[21:37.790 --> 21:39.210]  It's not going to be like that.
[21:39.210 --> 21:44.530]  I don't think, I know I got way off track on that, but I don't think that the buds
[21:44.530 --> 21:46.250]  are the nutrient.
[21:46.250 --> 21:47.630]  They've converted into buds now.
[21:47.630 --> 21:49.530]  It's not just nitrogen and phosphorus and potassium.
[21:49.530 --> 21:54.090]  So you can't really wash that out of the buds in my opinion.
[21:54.090 --> 21:55.290]  I don't have science behind this.
[21:55.290 --> 21:57.130]  I'm trying to explain my theory.
[21:57.130 --> 22:02.090]  So that stuff has turned into, you mixed up A and B and now you've got C and you can't
[22:02.090 --> 22:05.410]  wash A and B back out or you would just lose C.
[22:05.410 --> 22:10.010]  And I understand that you want to rinse the nutrients out so the buds burn cleanly.
[22:10.010 --> 22:14.170]  But I think if you flushed and even if they're not showing you that they're angry, you're
[22:14.170 --> 22:15.790]  not going to smoke the leaves.
[22:15.790 --> 22:17.730]  So the leaves don't need to change colors.
[22:17.730 --> 22:22.090]  As long as the plants are flushed and they've stopped eating, they've metabolized all the
[22:22.090 --> 22:27.410]  stuff in there and turned anything that was in the plant system into smokable buds.
[22:27.410 --> 22:28.410]  That is my theory.
[22:28.410 --> 22:30.450]  I don't have science behind that.
[22:30.450 --> 22:33.370]  I can't prove that, but that's what I'm thinking.
[22:33.370 --> 22:34.910]  You're not going to smoke those leaves.
[22:34.910 --> 22:37.390]  So why are you watching for the leaves to change colors?
[22:37.390 --> 22:38.870]  Other than it looks fucking great.
[22:38.870 --> 22:42.510]  It's really beautiful when you've got a nice row of plants and they've got that fall colors.
[22:42.510 --> 22:45.270]  That's my fall color fucking photograph right there.
[22:45.270 --> 22:48.790]  If I was going to make a postcard for somebody, it'd be fall color cannabis leaves.
[22:48.790 --> 22:54.150]  But you're just trying to get the plants to stop eating and use up the stored food.
[22:54.150 --> 22:56.550]  You can't remove that part from the plant in my opinion.
[22:56.550 --> 22:57.710]  I don't have science behind this.
[22:57.710 --> 23:01.110]  I am still learning you guys, just like you guys, I'm still learning.
[23:01.110 --> 23:04.670]  I may be learning on a different level and learning different things, but I am still
[23:04.670 --> 23:05.670]  learning.
[23:05.670 --> 23:06.670]  I don't feel like I know it all.
[23:06.670 --> 23:07.670]  I'll never know it all.
[23:07.670 --> 23:08.950]  That's one of the great things about cannabis.
[23:08.950 --> 23:12.070]  When I learn something, I go, oh, that's really cool.
[23:12.070 --> 23:15.710]  And then I realized that that makes me able to learn two more things.
[23:15.710 --> 23:19.950]  And when I learned those two things, I got to learn three more fucking things to understand
[23:19.950 --> 23:23.990]  those two things, to be able to put those three things with the first two things I learned
[23:23.990 --> 23:25.230]  back with some old school shit.
[23:25.230 --> 23:27.110]  And then I go, oh man, and my head explodes.
[23:27.110 --> 23:29.510]  And I just learned 12 new fucking things on accident.
[23:29.910 --> 23:31.910]  It's like an epiphany every day in the grow for me.
[23:31.910 --> 23:35.350]  I love learning you guys, and I'm glad that you want to learn with me and from me.
[23:35.350 --> 23:38.110]  I'm fucking high as shit from that coin style live batter.
[23:38.110 --> 23:40.750]  So I'm going to get myself back on track here.
[23:40.750 --> 23:42.410]  I think your plants will be great.
[23:42.410 --> 23:43.990]  You flushed for two weeks.
[23:43.990 --> 23:46.110]  Your runoff and your PPM was very low.
[23:46.110 --> 23:47.910]  So your plants aren't eating.
[23:47.910 --> 23:49.230]  They've cannibalized themselves.
[23:49.230 --> 23:51.430]  They've eaten all the nutrients that were left over.
[23:51.430 --> 23:54.030]  Now I want to know how was the smoke?
[23:54.030 --> 23:55.550]  I've seen pictures of the grow.
[23:55.550 --> 23:57.230]  I've gotten a report on the grow.
[23:57.230 --> 23:58.750]  I know that you flushed.
[23:58.750 --> 24:00.550]  This message came in a little bit ago.
[24:00.550 --> 24:03.310]  I want to know how did this crop turn out?
[24:03.310 --> 24:07.110]  Also, I owe you an apology because it took me a long time to get this message on the show.
[24:07.110 --> 24:10.910]  And the last episode I did say, I think I'm caught up on Patreon messages.
[24:10.910 --> 24:12.750]  And our friend Xavier said, hey bro, you're not.
[24:12.750 --> 24:13.430]  You skipped me.
[24:13.430 --> 24:14.590]  So I found your message.
[24:14.590 --> 24:15.110]  Here you are.
[24:15.110 --> 24:16.990]  I apologize for taking a while.
[24:16.990 --> 24:19.350]  I'm pretty sure you've cut that down, smoked it by now.
[24:19.350 --> 24:23.390]  Let me know what it tastes like, how it burns, and if you're satisfied.
[24:23.390 --> 24:26.750]  And then let's see what we can improve in the next grow.
[24:26.750 --> 24:29.030]  All right, Xavier, I want to thank you for the great Patreon message.
[24:29.030 --> 24:31.030]  I want to thank you for the continued support.
[24:31.030 --> 24:35.190]  I want to move into one more email for this episode.
[24:35.190 --> 24:37.630]  And this one goes just like this.
[24:37.630 --> 24:39.110]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[24:39.110 --> 24:44.310]  Thanks for being extremely and extremely positive force during the times we all face.
[24:44.310 --> 24:45.590]  Much appreciated.
[24:45.590 --> 24:47.550]  Thank you for noticing.
[24:47.550 --> 24:51.270]  I'm not always super happy and positive, but when I come on a camera or a microphone,
[24:51.270 --> 24:52.510]  I got to be in a good mood.
[24:52.510 --> 24:56.710]  Trust me, some days I wake up and I go, ah, there's some bummers in my life sometimes.
[24:56.710 --> 24:57.750]  But what are we going to do?
[24:57.750 --> 24:58.870]  Are we going to be bummed out all day?
[24:58.870 --> 25:00.350]  Are we going to have a bummer moment?
[25:00.350 --> 25:03.870]  And you take a dab and fucking realize that you got a lot of other good shit going on.
[25:03.870 --> 25:07.910]  You got one bummer moment and like 9,000 good moments every day.
[25:07.910 --> 25:09.990]  I'm going to embrace those 9,000 good moments.
[25:09.990 --> 25:13.630]  So I try to stay positive, especially during these weird fucking times.
[25:13.630 --> 25:17.830]  Having an audience that are basically my friends and backup family, that really helps.
[25:17.830 --> 25:19.350]  So thank you guys.
[25:19.350 --> 25:20.350]  It goes on.
[25:20.350 --> 25:22.390]  It says, I have a few questions for you.
[25:22.430 --> 25:26.830]  I recently listened to episode 404, Grow Lessons, part four.
[25:26.830 --> 25:29.390]  Man, you are way behind, but thank you for listening.
[25:29.390 --> 25:33.030]  It says, I heard you talk about the Shine a few times.
[25:33.030 --> 25:34.710]  One of my questions is on the Shine.
[25:34.710 --> 25:38.430]  So Shine is a product from, it's hydroponic research.
[25:38.430 --> 25:40.150]  They make the Veg Bloom line.
[25:40.150 --> 25:41.350]  I recommend the Shine.
[25:41.350 --> 25:42.350]  It's a great product.
[25:42.350 --> 25:46.830]  It says, I'm wondering what weeks of bloom do you recommend using the Shine?
[25:46.830 --> 25:51.830]  I know you said using it a week before a flower should help stop initial stretch.
[25:51.830 --> 25:54.070]  I also use during the first five days of flush.
[25:54.070 --> 25:58.470]  I also heard you mention that some kind of enzyme would be good to add at the end with
[25:58.470 --> 25:59.470]  the Shine.
[25:59.470 --> 26:00.830]  I'm using advanced nutrients.
[26:00.830 --> 26:03.870]  So what I need to use SensiZyme as my enzymes.
[26:03.870 --> 26:06.150]  There's a lot of good stuff to talk about here in this.
[26:06.150 --> 26:07.350]  So let me back up.
[26:07.350 --> 26:10.150]  What weeks of bloom do you recommend Shine?
[26:10.150 --> 26:14.710]  And then they remembered that I recommend using it the week before you start flower
[26:14.710 --> 26:17.430]  to help stop initial stretch.
[26:17.430 --> 26:20.390]  Shine is not a cheap product.
[26:20.390 --> 26:21.790]  It's got a good price tag on it.
[26:21.790 --> 26:25.950]  So a lot of people use Shine sparingly or as needed.
[26:25.950 --> 26:27.870]  I use Shine extra.
[26:27.870 --> 26:32.470]  And I find that if I've got plants that are super stretchy at the beginning of flower,
[26:32.470 --> 26:36.470]  if I give them a product called Shine right before flower and through the beginning of
[26:36.470 --> 26:38.830]  flower, they do not stretch as much.
[26:38.830 --> 26:42.750]  Give them half of the recommended dose or the recommended dose, which I think is a gram
[26:42.750 --> 26:45.190]  or two per gallon of water.
[26:45.190 --> 26:46.190]  Start off small.
[26:46.190 --> 26:47.190]  You don't need to give it a lot.
[26:47.190 --> 26:49.550]  Just have the presence of Shine in there at the beginning.
[26:49.550 --> 26:51.270]  And they'll say, oh, we're going to get fed real well.
[26:51.270 --> 26:52.270]  I don't need to stretch real hard.
[26:52.270 --> 26:53.270]  There's plenty of nutrients.
[26:53.270 --> 26:54.550]  I don't need to go crazy.
[26:54.550 --> 26:57.230]  They don't stretch as much.
[26:57.230 --> 26:59.430]  Also like I said before, the product is not free.
[26:59.430 --> 27:00.730]  It's a little bit spendy.
[27:00.730 --> 27:05.790]  If you don't want to start early and spend an extra three or two weeks using the Shine,
[27:05.790 --> 27:08.310]  that is when you start at the beginning of week three.
[27:08.310 --> 27:10.310]  You can start a week two or week three.
[27:10.310 --> 27:14.110]  The earlier the better in my opinion, but get it in there by the start of week three.
[27:14.110 --> 27:17.190]  That is when you need it in there.
[27:17.190 --> 27:19.550]  Before flower will help reduce stretch.
[27:19.550 --> 27:22.430]  Having it in there at the beginning of flower will help reduce stretch.
[27:22.430 --> 27:27.270]  Having it in there early will help start trichome development earlier, start packing on thicker,
[27:27.270 --> 27:28.270]  denser buds.
[27:28.270 --> 27:32.670]  So it's kind of up to your budget and how many things you want to be mixing in, your
[27:32.670 --> 27:34.870]  PPMs, your grow style.
[27:34.870 --> 27:35.870]  That's kind of what it's up to.
[27:35.870 --> 27:37.310]  How much Shine do you have access to?
[27:37.310 --> 27:38.310]  What's your budget?
[27:38.310 --> 27:40.950]  I said that already, but that's how I use it.
[27:40.950 --> 27:43.790]  If you want to go early, it will help stop with the stretch.
[27:43.790 --> 27:46.830]  Also to help stop with stretch, crack and twist those plants.
[27:46.830 --> 27:48.470]  I talk about popping and twisting.
[27:48.470 --> 27:52.990]  You basically grab at one spot, grab at another, twist your hands opposite directions, kind
[27:52.990 --> 27:54.350]  of gently until you hear a pop.
[27:54.350 --> 27:57.630]  It should sound like a knuckle popped.
[27:57.630 --> 28:00.150]  Once you hear that sound, just move up and do it again.
[28:00.150 --> 28:01.710]  Do that all over the entire plant.
[28:01.710 --> 28:03.750]  Give it knuckles, burl it up real well.
[28:03.750 --> 28:07.830]  That plant will spend most of its energy fixing those broken knuckles and it's not going to
[28:07.830 --> 28:10.030]  slow down anything other than the vertical growth.
[28:10.030 --> 28:11.430]  We're not making buds yet.
[28:11.430 --> 28:14.110]  The plant is still realizing, oh, it's flower time.
[28:14.110 --> 28:16.630]  I need to transition from vegging to flower.
[28:16.630 --> 28:17.870]  So the hormones are moving around.
[28:18.270 --> 28:19.790]  The plant's trying to figure out what to do.
[28:19.790 --> 28:22.310]  It'll get into flower in about 14 days.
[28:22.310 --> 28:26.310]  Crack it, pop it, twist it just before flower, right at the start of flower, and then about
[28:26.310 --> 28:28.510]  week three, and then keep going if you want to.
[28:28.510 --> 28:30.790]  That'll stop your stretch from getting too out of control.
[28:30.790 --> 28:33.990]  So add the shine and then crack and twist.
[28:33.990 --> 28:37.390]  It says also use during the first five days of flush.
[28:37.390 --> 28:41.950]  Yes, if you're in cocoa and you're going to flush for about 14 days, you can add shine
[28:41.950 --> 28:45.590]  with your flush, but make sure you flush hard at the end to get that out of there.
[28:45.590 --> 28:49.110]  That is kind of a more advanced grower technique.
[28:49.110 --> 28:53.230]  Some beginner growers may burn the plants or have a shitty tasting product if they try
[28:53.230 --> 28:54.590]  to go too hard at the end.
[28:54.590 --> 29:00.070]  But if you're flushing, you can use about two grams of shine for the first five days
[29:00.070 --> 29:01.350]  of the flush cycle.
[29:01.350 --> 29:04.030]  If you're going to flush for 14 days, do that.
[29:04.030 --> 29:05.790]  You got to add time to the flush phase.
[29:05.790 --> 29:07.910]  So just clean water and shine.
[29:07.910 --> 29:11.150]  Then I said that I could add some kind of an enzyme to the flush phase.
[29:11.150 --> 29:13.950]  Yes, I like enzymes during flush.
[29:14.070 --> 29:18.270]  Again, this is kind of budget according, budget friendly.
[29:18.270 --> 29:21.790]  If you've got an unlimited budget and you can buy some enzymes, if you've got a big
[29:21.790 --> 29:23.230]  grow, enzymes get expensive.
[29:23.230 --> 29:25.510]  If you have a little tiny grow, enzymes aren't that expensive.
[29:25.510 --> 29:29.910]  You could buy a bottle of Hygrozyme or Sensyzyme and that'll go a long way.
[29:29.910 --> 29:33.750]  If it fits your budget, flush with some enzymes for the first week or so.
[29:33.750 --> 29:37.310]  What that will do is the enzymes get in the root zone and break down all the bullshit
[29:37.310 --> 29:38.750]  and help clean out that root zone.
[29:38.750 --> 29:41.530]  So as you're flushing, you're getting out everything.
[29:41.530 --> 29:45.490]  You guys that recycle your cocoa or soil, that's a really good idea to make sure that
[29:45.490 --> 29:49.530]  all the small roots, all the dead stuff, all the decaying matter in there gets broken down
[29:49.530 --> 29:52.250]  and cleaned out of your root zone before you recycle that.
[29:52.250 --> 29:54.170]  So I do recommend an enzyme in there.
[29:54.170 --> 29:56.330]  I like enzymes a lot in my grow.
[29:56.330 --> 30:00.370]  It really helps out, does a lot of things, keeps the soil safe and healthy.
[30:00.370 --> 30:04.170]  A little bit of enzymes, a little bit of plus life together, your soil will be really happy.
[30:04.170 --> 30:07.330]  Lots of microbes in there with that, obviously every time.
[30:07.330 --> 30:08.810]  But I do like enzymes.
[30:08.810 --> 30:11.630]  The next part of the question is I'm using advanced nutrients.
[30:11.630 --> 30:14.410]  So would I need to use Sensyzyme as my enzyme?
[30:14.410 --> 30:15.770]  No, absolutely not.
[30:15.770 --> 30:19.090]  There's no need to stick with that brand specific nutrient.
[30:19.090 --> 30:22.970]  Just because you're using advanced nutrients does not mean you have to use Sensyzyme.
[30:22.970 --> 30:27.970]  You can use any enzyme product out there that fits your budget, fits your growth style,
[30:27.970 --> 30:30.290]  or is simply available at your local growth store.
[30:30.290 --> 30:31.790]  Some products are harder to get.
[30:31.790 --> 30:33.130]  Some people don't like to shop online.
[30:33.130 --> 30:34.770]  They don't want Amazon showing up.
[30:34.770 --> 30:40.890]  I ordered a carbon filter and they brought me a carbon filter with no like wrapping around it.
[30:40.890 --> 30:44.690]  It just said carbon filter and I was like, fuck, I didn't need that delivered here.
[30:44.690 --> 30:45.970]  But it came that way.
[30:45.970 --> 30:48.050]  So I don't like to order some things from Amazon.
[30:48.050 --> 30:48.650]  Here's a trick.
[30:48.650 --> 30:51.370]  If you're going to order something from Amazon, like a carbon filter,
[30:51.370 --> 30:54.610]  there's a box that says this item is a gift.
[30:54.610 --> 30:56.690]  Click it as a gift and they'll wrap it for you.
[30:56.690 --> 31:01.290]  Now when it shows up at your house, it's fucking wrapped and it's not showing that this is a carbon filter.
[31:01.290 --> 31:03.010]  This is a box of nutrients.
[31:03.050 --> 31:03.970]  That'll help you out.
[31:03.970 --> 31:05.810]  Get that shit gift wrapped.
[31:05.810 --> 31:06.530]  All right.
[31:06.530 --> 31:07.970]  Where the hell are we in this message?
[31:07.970 --> 31:10.450]  I lost my place.
[31:10.450 --> 31:12.370]  I remember where we are.
[31:12.370 --> 31:15.130]  I was just about to say you don't need Sensyzyme.
[31:15.130 --> 31:17.370]  You can use, there are a lot of enzymes out there.
[31:17.370 --> 31:18.330]  I don't even need to list them.
[31:18.330 --> 31:19.370]  Get the one that's available for you.
[31:19.370 --> 31:21.290]  Then I was going to say thank you for the great message.
[31:21.290 --> 31:24.730]  I wanted to check and see if you left the name on here, but you did not leave a name.
[31:24.730 --> 31:26.330]  I don't know if you want your name said.
[31:26.330 --> 31:27.730]  So you know who you are.
[31:27.730 --> 31:29.010]  Thank you for the great message.
[31:29.010 --> 31:31.210]  Thank you for all the good support.
[31:31.210 --> 31:33.730]  I'm fucking rambly from those dabs.
[31:33.730 --> 31:39.490]  I should wrap it up, but since I'm so rambly, we're going to go ahead and read one more message.
[31:39.490 --> 31:41.610]  Big shout out to all of our Patreon supporters.
[31:41.610 --> 31:44.690]  This one comes from North, North Terps on Patreon.
[31:44.690 --> 31:45.170]  What up North?
[31:45.170 --> 31:46.770]  I see your name pop up a lot.
[31:46.770 --> 31:47.850]  Thank you for the support.
[31:47.850 --> 31:50.210]  This one goes, hey Rasta Jeff.
[31:50.210 --> 31:51.850]  I still think that should be a song.
[31:51.850 --> 31:54.130]  Then it says, great, great shows.
[31:54.130 --> 31:56.250]  Thanks for always answering my questions.
[31:56.250 --> 31:58.010]  You're a real blessing to have around.
[31:58.010 --> 32:00.170]  I learn a lot of practical knowledge.
[32:00.210 --> 32:02.250]  I love how punctual you are.
[32:02.250 --> 32:04.290]  I didn't realize how punctual I am.
[32:04.290 --> 32:05.010]  Thank you.
[32:05.010 --> 32:08.410]  That's because I can set shows to come out at a certain time when they pop up.
[32:08.410 --> 32:11.330]  I don't know that I'm sitting here at the time all these shows come out.
[32:11.330 --> 32:13.610]  That's pre-programmed stuff.
[32:13.610 --> 32:17.810]  Unless you mean the Instagram live every Monday around 710, I'm here.
[32:17.810 --> 32:20.890]  I need to keep going with this email because I'm fucking rambly.
[32:20.890 --> 32:25.410]  It says, with that being said, you talked about how well organized you are,
[32:25.410 --> 32:27.770]  your spreadsheets and how you love them.
[32:27.810 --> 32:33.770]  I was wondering if I can get an empty copy of these so that I can implement this into my life.
[32:33.770 --> 32:40.130]  I'm organized only in my head, but my ADD and my bad handwriting does not allow me to do the best I can.
[32:40.130 --> 32:45.770]  Also, I have half a thumb on my writing hand and I haven't been able to write well.
[32:45.770 --> 32:48.770]  So if you could help me, that would be dope.
[32:48.770 --> 32:50.010]  Also, shout out to White Mike.
[32:50.010 --> 32:50.850]  What's up, dude?
[32:50.850 --> 32:52.570]  I like seeing you on the show more.
[32:52.570 --> 32:53.450]  Mike got a shout out.
[32:53.450 --> 32:54.490]  What's up, bro?
[32:54.610 --> 33:01.050]  Big shout out to North Terps, who did not use a single piece of punctuation in this whole message.
[33:01.050 --> 33:02.410]  That's why it was hard to read.
[33:02.410 --> 33:03.410]  Just picking on you, North.
[33:03.410 --> 33:04.410]  You don't have a thumb.
[33:04.410 --> 33:07.770]  So you're missing your punctuation thumb, it looks like.
[33:07.770 --> 33:11.010]  Nothing but love for you.
[33:11.010 --> 33:16.570]  North realizes that I'm organized and I've said that I keep a lot of my information on spreadsheets.
[33:16.570 --> 33:20.690]  And North is asking for a copy of my spreadsheets.
[33:20.690 --> 33:22.970]  I don't really have a template that I use.
[33:23.010 --> 33:28.930]  I open up a Google document and I make a custom document for anything that I'm doing.
[33:28.930 --> 33:34.170]  So right now, I've got a document that says Room A, and then that's a column.
[33:34.170 --> 33:35.970]  And then on the side, it's just the date.
[33:35.970 --> 33:38.010]  And then on the date, I will put...
[33:38.010 --> 33:41.090]  So right here, it's like September 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.
[33:41.090 --> 33:46.610]  And then in Room A, I've got the pH and EC of the water going into the plants.
[33:46.610 --> 33:49.370]  And the next graph is the water coming out of the plants.
[33:49.370 --> 33:52.370]  So it's Room A in, Room A out.
[33:52.370 --> 33:56.010]  And I just know that the Google Doc is actually labeled Room A,
[33:56.010 --> 33:58.290]  and the first two columns are in and out.
[33:58.290 --> 34:02.090]  And then every day, I just know that in and out, that's what's going in and out of those plants.
[34:02.090 --> 34:06.170]  And I just make and create Google documents that work for my mind, for my growth style,
[34:06.170 --> 34:08.690]  for my brain, for my phone, for my iPad.
[34:08.690 --> 34:10.450]  I just build them like that, they work for me.
[34:10.450 --> 34:13.210]  So I don't really have custom spreadsheets or anything.
[34:13.210 --> 34:15.170]  I guess they're all just custom for me.
[34:15.170 --> 34:17.970]  So my advice is learn how to use Google Documents.
[34:17.970 --> 34:21.010]  A lot of businesses, a lot of the future is on Google Docs.
[34:21.010 --> 34:23.610]  So learn how to use Google Docs, get that figured out,
[34:23.610 --> 34:25.770]  and just create your own custom spreadsheets.
[34:25.770 --> 34:29.930]  You'll open, what is it, Google Spreadsheets, Google Docs.
[34:29.930 --> 34:33.890]  You'll learn to use both of those, and you'll start utilizing it to the best of your ability.
[34:33.890 --> 34:36.130]  You're going to have to get your thumbs figured out
[34:36.130 --> 34:39.170]  because it does require a little bit better typing in those small boxes,
[34:39.170 --> 34:41.770]  but I think you'll be able to figure it out.
[34:41.770 --> 34:47.810]  The ADD doesn't make it easier by using a Google Doc because you go to open your phone,
[34:47.810 --> 34:50.450]  and now you've opened your phone, and then you see that I put out a new show,
[34:50.450 --> 34:53.650]  and now instead of making a Google Doc, you're watching my next podcast.
[34:53.650 --> 34:56.730]  But I think you'll figure it out, bro. I've got faith in you.
[34:56.730 --> 35:00.650]  Just open up a Google Document or a Google Spreadsheet, start poking around.
[35:00.650 --> 35:02.330]  It's free. You can't fuck it up.
[35:02.330 --> 35:04.290]  It may be easier for you on a computer.
[35:04.290 --> 35:06.650]  You can also share the same document.
[35:06.650 --> 35:09.290]  If you log into Google Docs with your email address,
[35:09.290 --> 35:12.650]  whatever it is, northnorthterps at fucking northterps.com,
[35:12.650 --> 35:15.450]  log in on your computer, log in on your mobile device,
[35:15.450 --> 35:18.930]  you can get the same spreadsheet on your both devices.
[35:18.930 --> 35:22.210]  It's much easier to do the spreadsheets on the computer sometimes,
[35:22.210 --> 35:24.890]  especially if you're missing a finger, it may help you out.
[35:24.890 --> 35:28.090]  So I wish I had more templates or more advice for you,
[35:28.090 --> 35:31.810]  but honestly, I just create my own Google Spreadsheets and Google Docs
[35:31.810 --> 35:33.530]  and write what I need to write.
[35:33.530 --> 35:37.010]  Not a lot of it happens on paper anymore because like yourself,
[35:37.010 --> 35:38.730]  I've got scribbly handwriting,
[35:38.730 --> 35:42.850]  and also paper just makes piles and gets fucking a mess in the grow.
[35:42.850 --> 35:45.690]  So most of it's in Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets,
[35:45.690 --> 35:48.050]  and then it's there forever, and then it's in my computer,
[35:48.050 --> 35:50.090]  it's at my iPad, it's at my iPhone.
[35:50.090 --> 35:51.490]  And then if I go to another computer,
[35:51.490 --> 35:54.010]  if I go to another facility and I want to look at something,
[35:54.010 --> 35:57.010]  all I have to do is get a computer, log into my Google account,
[35:57.010 --> 35:59.570]  open up my Google Spreadsheets, and I can look right there.
[35:59.570 --> 36:02.290]  Also, you can share those documents and spreadsheets.
[36:02.290 --> 36:05.530]  So if I've got a couple of guys that run a grow on a weekend,
[36:05.530 --> 36:07.370]  and I'll have questions and I'll be like,
[36:07.370 --> 36:08.810]  hey, did you do the to-do list?
[36:08.810 --> 36:11.370]  And instead of asking them, I can open up a to-do list
[36:11.370 --> 36:14.530]  and see if a guy has put his initials next to the task
[36:14.530 --> 36:16.530]  because that's what I have to do, put your initials next to it.
[36:16.570 --> 36:17.970]  Now, if it's done correctly or wrong,
[36:17.970 --> 36:20.130]  I know who to praise are fucking kicking the balls.
[36:20.130 --> 36:21.570]  So it's got their initials.
[36:21.570 --> 36:23.450]  I did it, I did it, and I can see.
[36:23.450 --> 36:24.930]  I don't even have to bug anybody.
[36:24.930 --> 36:26.650]  We share those Google documents together.
[36:26.650 --> 36:29.130]  I can edit it. They can see the edits in real time.
[36:29.130 --> 36:30.570]  So I can put, hey, you guys go to lunch.
[36:30.570 --> 36:31.810]  You've been working too hard.
[36:31.810 --> 36:34.130]  And they'll get a notification that the document has been edited.
[36:34.130 --> 36:35.770]  They'll go, oh, boss said go to lunch.
[36:35.770 --> 36:37.090]  He's watching us on camera.
[36:37.090 --> 36:39.250]  They'll go to lunch, then I'll put something funny in there
[36:39.250 --> 36:39.850]  when they're at lunch.
[36:39.850 --> 36:42.050]  When they come back, they'll check the document again.
[36:42.050 --> 36:44.090]  They'll find out who got to clean the toilets at the end of the day
[36:44.090 --> 36:45.930]  because I watched them stand around on camera.
[36:45.930 --> 36:50.290]  So Google documents, Google spreadsheets, they're free.
[36:50.290 --> 36:52.130]  They're super easy.
[36:52.130 --> 36:53.730]  Customize it for yourself.
[36:53.730 --> 36:57.050]  If you've got ADD, my documents may not work for you.
[36:57.050 --> 36:58.770]  Make those documents yourself.
[36:58.770 --> 37:00.570]  Make it work for your brain.
[37:00.570 --> 37:02.410]  If you have to, bro, just write it on paper.
[37:02.410 --> 37:06.330]  As long as you're taking notes and making some sort of documentation,
[37:06.330 --> 37:08.450]  maybe get a calendar, maybe an old school calendar.
[37:08.450 --> 37:09.850]  Maybe that may be the way to go.
[37:09.850 --> 37:14.170]  But I'm just doing custom, my own custom tailored Google docs
[37:14.170 --> 37:17.250]  and spreadsheets, basically rows and columns, bro.
[37:17.250 --> 37:20.010]  The information that you need and the date that you need it,
[37:20.010 --> 37:21.330]  fill in the blanks.
[37:21.330 --> 37:22.890]  All right, NorthNorthTurps, I want to thank you
[37:22.890 --> 37:26.890]  for the continued Patreon support and for the great message.

[37:42.890 --> 37:45.450]  to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[37:45.450 --> 37:47.010]  You guys, I've got to wrap up this podcast.
[37:47.010 --> 37:49.450]  I've been going for a little bit longer than anticipated.
[37:49.450 --> 37:50.610]  It was well worth it.
[37:50.610 --> 37:52.090]  Once again, shout out to Green Dot Labs
[37:52.090 --> 37:55.770]  for the delicious coin style live batter.
[37:55.770 --> 37:58.570]  Really got me chatty and rambly for the episode.

[38:42.530 --> 38:43.450]  And until next time,
[38:43.450 --> 38:46.210]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
